"Subordination 787In the first sentence, the relative is restrictive: the NP is specified and its
specification results from the information given by the relative clause. In
contrast, in the second sentence the relative is non-restrictive, because the
head is a proper noun, which has its own specified reference. The information given by the relative doesn't contribute to the specification of the NP.
As can be seen in the examples above, relativization is carried out in the
same way in both cases, and no formal difference is attached to the distinction between the two types of interpretation.
The use of modifiers with proper nouns is stylistically rather marked, and
relative clauses are no exception. Here is an example of such a construction:
(1900)EtaArestik,horrenandAresti.ERGsooraintsukoArestik,right.now.RELAresti.ERGhainbeste ezagutu dugun

'And Aresti, Aresti who is so modern, Aresti who we know so well,

[Mitx. EIG IV:81]4.10.3.1.9. Relatives describing proper nouns
Personal pronouns are full NPs and they can receive no modifier at all.
Therefore no personal pronoun occurs as head of a relative clause:
(1901)*[Maitezaitudan]zurekinezkondulove
have.2A/lE.COMP you.COM marry
Ί want to marry you whom I love so much.'nahidut.wanthaveThis sentence is ungrammatical because the head of the relative is a personal pronoun (zurekin 'with you'). However, relativization of personal
pronouns is possible if a personal pronoun is not used as head of the whole
phrase. The classical strategy uses a demonstrative pronoun after the relative: the first demonstrative (hau) for the first person singular (hauek for the
plural), and the second demonstrative (hori) for the second person (horiek
for the plural):788 Syntax(1902) Zuk, Judua
youJewzarelariknola eskatzendidazuare.COMP.PRTThowAUXask.IMPFedatera,[Samariarra naizen]honi?drink.ΝΟΜ.ALLSamaritanthis.DATam.COMP'How is it possible that you, being a Jew, are asking me, who am a
Samaritan, for something to drink?'
In (1902), the dative NP is the first person singular. The personal pronoun
as such has no overt realization within the sentence, but appears as the first
demonstrative (honi) after the relative.
Usually the whole phrase is appositive (see 4.10.3.3.4), and follows the
personal pronoun it its plain form. Both NPs, the personal pronoun and the
appositive phrase, bear the same case marker:
(1903) Baina

ditut begienpast-present.DET.PLhaveaurreansoil-soilik.front.LOConlyeyes.GEN'But I, who have not received any charisma, only have the present
and the past before my eyes.' [Mitx. IH:392]
Observe that in (1902) and (1903) both the verb within the relative (naizen,
hartu ez dudan) and the verb of which the personal pronoun is the argument
in the main sentence (didazu, ditut) agree with the first person. Therefore, it
can be said that, although personal pronouns cannot be used as relative
heads, they can be relativized.
Some grammarians have claimed that it is possible to use some intensive
pronouns bearing a local case ending as head of relatives. These pronouns
are morphologically complex and result from the adjunction of the demonstrative to the personal pronoun itself (in its emphatic form): for instance,
nerau (<neur + hau) for the first person singular. Although such constructs
are somewhat easier to accept than those where the head is an unmarked
personal pronoun, the result is still bad, and speakers can hardly employ
such forms:Subordination(1904)789*[Maite zaitudan]

"Postpositions1713.2. Case and number inflection of noun phrases
J.I. Hualde
3.2.1. The nature of nominal inflection
In noun phrases containing a single noun only the last word of the phrase
carries case and number inflection, which is marked by suffixes. The word
in the noun phrase inflected for case/number is not necessarily the head
noun. If an adjective or another modifier follows the noun the inflectional
suffixes will appear on this word. That is, in Basque number and case inflection is a property of noun phrases. In the following examples, we separate
the inflectional suffix from the stem with a hyphen for clarity:
Table 58. Nominal inflection
(a)
(b)
(c)gizon-ari
man.DET.DAT
gizon gazte-ari
gizon gazte hon-i'to the man'
'to the young man'
'to this young man'More details on the structure of noun phrases are given in section 3.1. In this
section, we adopt a form-based approach to the study of the morphology of
nominal inflection, without meaning to imply that all the forms listed correspond to grammatical cases or are otherwise syntactically comparable.","[200, 201]"
"The noun phrase1553.1.6.1.4. Indefinite pronouns
There are three major classes of indefinite pronouns (and related items), and
these are not equivalent. Almost all are formed from the corresponding interrogatives, by affixation or reduplication.
The first group we may call the 'existential' indefinites; these correspond
to the English indefinites in 'some-', and are formed by suffixing -bait to
the interrogative: norbait 'somebody', zerbait 'something', nonbait 'somewhere', noizbait 'sometime', nolabait 'somehow'. There is no form related
to zein 'which?'
This -bait is historically derived from reanalysis of the verbal prefix bait(see sections 4.10.1.1.6 and 4.10.2.1.3). In the earlier language, therefore,
-bait followed a case-suffix, as in norkbait (ergative) and noribmt (dative).
Today only the restructured forms like norbaitek and norbaiti are in use.
However, internal inflection is still found in norabait '(to) somewhere'
(more common than nonbaitera)
The pronouns norbait and zerbait may be modified, as in zerbait ona
'something good' and ona den zerbait 'something which is good'; note the
presence of the article -a in both constructions. The first construction is only
possible when the pronoun stands in the absolutive case.
The pronoun zerbait may take a diminutive suffix to express 'a little
something'. Eastern varieties use forms like zerbaitto, but western varieties
have a different ordering, with zertxobait.
In eastern varieties (only), zerbait may be used as an indefinite determiner, as in zerbait obra 'some piece of work'.
Equivalent in function, but much less frequent, are nor edo nor 'somebody' and zer edo zer (B zeozer) 'something'; these consist of nor 'who?'
and zer 'what?' reduplicated about edo 'or'.
Semantically similar to norbait, but perhaps emphasizing the sense of
'somebody or other', 'one or another', is a construction involving two instances of bat 'one' connected by edo 'or', by the genitive -en, or by both:
hence, bat edo bat, baten bat, or bat edoren bat.
The second group are the 'free-choice' indefinites; these correspond to
the English indefinites in 'any-' when these are not polarity items. There are
two different sets of these, the first found more or less throughout the country, the second largely confined to the west. The first set is formed by suffixing nahi 'want' to an interrogative: nornahi 'anybody (at all), anyone
(you like)', zernahi 'anything (you like)', nonnahi 'anywhere (you like)',
noiznahi 'any time (you like)', nolanahi 'any way (you like)', zeinnahi 'any,
whichever you like'. These are similar in form to the Castilian items like156 Morphologyquienquiera 'anybody at all', and may have originated as caiques. The second set is formed by prefixing edo 'or' to the corresponding interrogative:
edonor 'anybody at all', edozer 'anything at all', edonon 'anywhere at all',
edonoiz 'any time at all', edonola 'anyhow', edozein 'any'.
The third group are polarity items, and they correspond to English forms
in 'any-' in that function (see 3.1.2.4). In principle, they are formed by prefixing e- to the interrogative, but there are numerous complications, and
northern varieties sometimes use unrelated forms in this function. Examples: ezer 'anything' (but also northern deus), inor (northern nehor) 'anybody', inon (northern nehon) 'anywhere', inoiz (northern nehoiz) 'ever' (but
also sekula[n]), inola (northern nehola) 'in any way'. The form ezein 'any',
from zein 'which?', is now archaic.
All the members of this third group are frequently reinforced by the particle ere 'also' (B bere or be). They occur in polarity contexts, typically under negation and in questions:
(121) Ez dut ezer(ere) ikusi.
not AUX anything see
Ί didn't see anything.'
(122)Inorkez duezererosi. (with two of these items)anyone not AUX anything buy'Nobody bought anything.'
(123) Inoiz ikusi al duzu kometa?
ever see Q AUX comet
'Have you ever seen a comet?'
In eastern varieties, a case-suffix may occasionally follow the reinforcing
ere, as in nehoneretik ez 'from nowhere at all', in place of nehondik ere ezBasque has no negative pronouns or related forms, and these are expressed by combining the items in this third group with ez 'not', as in the
examples just given: inor ez 'nobody', ezer (ere) ez or deus ez 'nothing',
inola (ere) ez 'in no way', and so on. Exception: in eastern varieties, deus or
its extended form deusik can be used in isolation to express 'nothing', without ez\ the same is not true of ezer.
A negative may take a diminutive suffix, as in ezertxo ere ez 'absolutely
nothing'.
An indefinite of the ezer type may be followed by guti ~ gutxi 'few, little' to express 'hardly any...': inor gutxi 'hardly anybody', ezer gutxi 'hardlyThe noun phrase157anything'. A case-ending follows, as in Inor gutxik daki hori 'Hardly anybody knows that'.
The interrogative nor 'who' functions as an indefinite meaning 'the one,
the person' in locutions like this:
(124) Μ ez naiz nor
I not amhori egiteko.who thatdo.NOM.RELΊ am not the one to do that/I am not the right person to do that.'
This is comparable to Castilian Yo no soy quien para hacerlo.
Both nor and inor ~ nehor are occasionally used in the sense of 'person
of quality, worthy person', as in zu nor bazara 'if you are worthy'. A rare
use of nor to mean 'some' is illustrated by the example
(125) Jendea, nor
peoplezaldiz,noroinez,etorri zen.who horse.INSTR who fooUNSTR arrive AUX'The people arrived, some on horseback, some on foot.'
The phrase ez nor eta hura 'not who and he' is attested for 'somebody
unknown', as in
(126) Goizbateanmorning one.LOCarkitu zuen otsoa
findAUX wolf...ez
nork eta ark ilia.
not who and he killed, DET
'In the morning he found a wolf, killed by somebody unknown.'
[Iztueta]
In northern varieties, deus could formerly be used as a noun meaning
'thing', as in hain deus izigarria 'what a terrible thing' and ene deusak 'my
things'. But this is no longer current, and it has never been true of ezer.
The item zer is very commonly used as an indefinite meaning 'something
(or other)'; in this use it is normally treated as a noun, taking the article:
Zera ikusi dut Ί saw something'. In formal styles, especially in writing, this
same zera is often used to fill the focus position just before the verb when
the focused item itself is so long it must be placed at the end of the sentence.
Example:158Morphology(127) Sailburuakzeraadierazi dukazetarienaurrean:minister.ERG s o m e t h i n g explain AUX journalists.GEN front.LOC15.000lanpostu berri sortuko
direla
datorren urtean.
job
new create.FUT AUX.that next
year.LOC
'The Minister explained to the assembled journalists that 15,000 new
jobs are to be created next year.'
(The intensive demonstrative hauxe and the phrase honako hau roughly,
'this here' can be used in the same way.) The frequent exclamation Bai
zera! means 'Get serious!' 'Yeah, sure!' (in the sarcastic American sense).
In eastern varieties, zer...ere may be wrapped around the bare stem of a
verb to express 'whatever', as in zer gerta ere 'whatever happens'. (For the
use of nor ere for 'whoever' in relative clauses, see section 4.10.3.4.3)
The interrogative zer 'what' is used, with the article -a, when a word is
momentarily forgotten: Zera ikusi nuen, urtxakurra Ί saw a, what's it
called, an otter'. (Indeed, in some southern varieties, the word has apparently been reanalyzed as a single noun zera.) The lost word may never be
supplied, as in the classic
(128 )Zuen zerak
gure zerean
dira.
your what.DET.PL our what.LOC are
'Your whatsits are in our thingy.'
This zer can even be applied to a person, as in Zu, zera, joan hemendik!
'Hey, you, what's-your-name, get out of here!'. In addition, zer can be used
as an adjective expressing a high degree of an unspecified quality, as in Oso
neska zera da 'She really is a [something] girl', in which the unexpressed
quality ('gorgeous', 'fiery', 'big', or whatever) must be inferred from the
context; this may be positive or negative. Finally, zer may be used in a simply enormous number of derivatives with more or less specific senses:
zeregi 'too fussy', zerena 'snoop, nosy parker', zerkeria 'hypocrisy', zerez
beterik 'furious' (roughly 'full of it'), and many others.
The pronoun norbera, from nor 'who' plus bera 'self, corresponds to the
impersonal 'one' in locutions like norbere herria 'one's own country'. Nor
'who' and the determiner zein 'which?' can also function as indefinite pronouns meaning 'each one' in locutions like the following. A genitive expression acts here as a variable linked to the pronoun:The noun phrase(129) Noribereadawho.DAT his/hers is159zuzenbidea.
right""The right thing is to give each one his/her due.'
(130) a. Zein bere bidetik
dabil.
which his way.ABL walks
'Each one takes his own path.'
b. zein bere tokian
which his place.LOC
'each in his own place'
When repeated, zein means 'some...others', as in zein zabalago, zein meharrago 'some more widely, others more narrowly'. For the use of zein as a
relative pronoun, see section 4.10.3.
3.1.6.1.5. Reflexives
There are no true reflexive pronouns; instead, reflexive noun phrases are
formed by combining the genitive of an intensive personal pronoun with
buru 'head' and the definite article -a. Here are the forms:
Table 56. Reflexive noun phrases
neure burua
'myself
heure burua
'yourself (intimate)
bere burua
'himself/herself
geure burua
'ourselves'
zeure burua
'yourself (unmarked)
zeuen burua
'yourselves'
zere(n) burua
'themselves'Some speakers add plural -k to the plural reflexives (geure buruak 'ourselves'); this was usual in the older language, but today it is less common
than the other form. Except when this -k is added, a reflexive is always formally non-plural and never triggers plural agreement in the verb:
(131) Ispiluan
ikusi dugu (*ditugu) geure
burua.
mirror.LOC see AUX
our.lNTS head
'We saw ourselves in the mirror.'
A reflexive noun phrase may never appear in subject position, but may
appear in any other position and take case-marking normally, except that it160Morphologymay not take the genitive case-ending. The ordinary intensive genitives like
neure are used instead.
Many western speakers use a different reflexive construction, in which
the transitive verb is construed intransitively and no reflexive NP is present:
Ispiluan ikusi naiz Ί saw myself in the mirror'. This second construction is
not possible with verbs of emotion, like maite *edun 'love', or with verbs
that have different meanings when used transitively and transitively, like hil
'die', 'kill' (see sections 4.1.2.9 and 4.9.2).","[184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190]"

Morphology3.1. The Noun Phrase: nouns, determiners and modifiers; pronouns and
names
R.L. Trask
3.1.1. Introduction
3.1.1.1. The basics
It is convenient to present the structure of the noun phrase in the form of a
template; an asterisk marks an element that may occur more than once:
Complex Modifier* - DETI - Ν - ADJ* - DET2
The positioning of degree modifiers is complex and variable, and is described in section 3.1.3.4. Any case-marker is suffixed to the end of the NP,
as described in section 3.2. Number-marking is possible only in the DET2
position, as explained below. Consequently, any number-marking or casemarking which is present appears only once, at the end of the noun phrase;
there is no NP-intemal agreement, and nouns cannot in fact be directly inflected at all: in Basque, it is noun phrases, and only noun phrases, which
can be inflected.
The only obligatory element is a determiner. With only minor exceptions,
an NP always contains a determiner; with just two significant exceptions, an
NP contains only one determiner. Here we use the label determiner in a
maximally broad sense, to include all of the following: (a) articles; (b) demonstratives; (c) the partitive marker; (d) numerals; (e) quantifiers; (f) interrogatives; (g) certain indefinite determiners.
A noun phrase may, of course, consist merely of a pronoun or a proper
name; pronouns are treated in section 3.1.6 and proper names in section
3.1.7.
As a rule, Basque has no grammatical gender and no noun classes, and
there are no classifiers. With only trivial phonological complications, all
noun phrases are constructed and inflected identically, except that animate
noun phrases form their local cases somewhat differently from inanimate114Morphologynoun phrases; see section 3.1.1.2 for an account, and see section 3.2.2.4 for
the list of forms.
The head of a noun phrase is the noun, if there is one, but see section
3.1.5 for headless NPs. The class of nouns is large and open, and nouns are
generally sharply distinct from other parts of speech, though see section
3.1.3.1 for a sample of words which can be either nouns or adjectives.
Words formed with the word-forming suffix -dun 'having, who has' can be
either nouns or adjectives. For example, from euskara 'Basque language',
the derivative euskaldun can be either a noun meaning 'Basque-speaker,
Basque' or an adjective meaning 'Basque-speaking'.
A noun may be monomorphemic, like neska 'girl' or zur 'wood'. It may
be derived from another word by means of a noun-forming suffix, like edertasun 'beauty' (from eder 'beautiful'), ikusmen 'vision' (from ikusi 'see'),
or jendetza 'crowd' (from jende 'people'). Or it may be compound in form,
like eskulan 'handicraft' (from esku 'hand' plus lan 'work'), logela 'bedroom' (from lo 'sleep' [n.] plus gela 'room'), gurpide 'cartpath' (from gurdi
'cart' plus bide 'road'), or the remarkable eztabaida 'argument, dispute'
(from the two complete sentences Ez da! Bai da! 'No, it isn't! Yes, it is!')
Sometimes a compound is written as two words; for example, 'sunflower'
may appear either as eguzkilore or as eguzki lore (eguzki 'sun' plus lore
'flower'), and 'old people's home' may be zaharretxe or zahar etxe (zahar
'old [person]' plus etxe 'house').
Nouns are divided into countable and uncountable nouns, and, as a rule,
an uncountable noun may not be the head of an NP which is overtly marked
for plural number. Observe, however, that many uncountable nouns can be
pluralized to give an individuating sense. For example, ogi 'bread' is uncountable as a generic, but is countable when it means 'loaf: ogiak 'loaves
of bread'. As in other languages, there are a few nouns which are idiosyncratic in this respect: for example, the Romance loan jende 'people' is uncountable in Spanish Basque (like Peninsular Spanish gente), but countable
in French Basque (like French gens). There are a few pluralia tantum, such
as guraizeak 'scissors' and frakak ~ prakak 'trousers'. Some words are regionally variable here: the nouns aza 'cabbage', orga 'cart, wagon', hilerri
'cemetery' and ote ~ ota 'gorse' are pluralia tantum for some speakers only:
azak, orgak, hilerriak, otak. But other words are ordinary count nouns, perhaps unexpectedly, like haitzur 'large shears'. Neologisms are variable:
'spectacles' is a count noun betaurreko for some speakers but a plurale tantum betaurrekoak for others.
The language is rich in abstract nouns, such as bizitza 'life', bakardade
'solitude', edertasun 'beauty' and zikinkeria 'filth, lewdness, depravity', butThe noun phrase115these do not differ at all from other nouns in their grammatical behavior,
though of course most of them cannot be counted. Nouns denoting activities
and events, such as lurrikara 'earthquake' (lur 'land, soil, earth' plus ikara
'tremor'), korrika 'race' (competition) and desegite 'destruction' are numerous and totally unremarkable. Collective nouns like komite 'committee'
and ekipo '(sports) team' are ordinary countable nouns, and they likewise
exhibit no distinctive behavior. Mass nouns like gari 'wheat' and elur
'snow' are ordinary uncountable nouns, and the language has no distinct
singulative forms; related individuating nouns are constructed by ordinary
lexical means, as in galburu 'head of wheat' (gal- 'wheat' plus buru 'head')
and elurluma 'snowflake' (elur 'snow' plus luma 'feather').
Noteworthy is the presence of a set of spatial nouns, such as aurre 'front,
space in front o f , atze 'space behind' and inguru 'vicinity'; these are ordinary nouns, but their case-inflected forms constitute the largest group of
postpositions in the language, as explained in section 3.3.1, and in postpositional use they exhibit a few idiosyncrasies.
Dvandva compounds are almost invariably plural in form, like aitamak
'parents' (aita 'father' plus ama 'mother'), hortz-haginak 'teeth' (hortz
'molar' plus hagin 'incisor'), and plater-pitxeruak 'crockery' {plater 'plate'
plus pitxeru 'pitcher'). Noteworthy is the case of Bizkai-Gipuzkoetan 'in
Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa', again with a plural ending (see section 3.8.1).
Otherwise, there are no irregular nouns in standard Basque (although in
local varieties one sometimes finds nouns which are exceptional in the morphophonological rules they trigger in combination with inflectional suffixes). As in Spanish, nouns of foreign origin lose all trace of their foreign
inflections, except sometimes for gender in loans from Spanish (see section
3.1.1.3); for example, fenomeno 'phenomenon' and erradio 'radius' behave
just like any other noun.","[142, 143, 144, 145]"
"Chapter 4
Syntax4.1. Valency and argument structure in the Basque verb
R. Etxepare
4.1.1. Valency and the auxiliary system: an outline
Leaving aside a small set of verbs (see 3.5.3), Basque finite verbs are composed of a morphologically independent lexical verb carrying aspectual information, and a clitic auxiliary bearing Tense, Agreement and Modal affixes. The choice of auxiliaries in Basque seems to be largely dependent on
the valency of the predicate. Intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive auxiliaries typically correspond to monovalent, bivalent and trivalent predicates.
The arguments of the verb (participants in the event, such as agents, themes
or patients, and beneficiaries) are mapped systematically by person and
number morphology corresponding to grammatical functions such as subject, object and indirect object. Changes in the argument structure of the
verb (as in the causative/inchoative alternation) are also signaled in the
choice of the auxiliary. However, in some cases the correlation between
valency and choice of auxiliary does not obtain. The mismatch between
valency and morphology is due in these cases to the contribution of an aspectual dimension (see section 4.1.1.3).
In order to maintain the two domains clear (lexical structure and morphology), I will refer to the valency of the verb with categories such as
monovalent, bivalent or trivalent, and to its morphological expression with
categories such as intransitive and transitive. The latter are familiar from
the structural analysis of basic verbal paradigms (in section 3.5.3) and are
based on the presence/absence of ergative morphology. When ergative morphology is present in the paradigm corresponding to a finite form, I will refer to that form as transitive. Otherwise, I will refer to that form as intransitive.
In sentences with transitive verbs, the subject is morphologically marked
as ergative and the direct object in the absolutive case (zero suffix). As for
one argument-verbs, Basque expresses morphologically a distinction between tow types of monovalent predicates that has been noted syntactically
in other languages. This is the distinction between unaccusative and unerga-364 Syntaxtive predicates (Perlmutter 1978; Burzio 1981). Subjects of unergative
predicates take the ergative case; subjects of unaccusative predicates, on the
other hand, take the absolutive case. In accord with case marking, unergative predicates take the transitive auxiliary, and unaccusative predicates the
intransitive one:
(499) a. Jonek
Jon.ERGardoaekarri du.wine.DET.(ABS)bring(transitive)AUX'Jon brought the wine.'
b. Jonek
saltatu du.
(unergative)
Jon.ERG jump
AUX
'Jon jumped.'
c. Jon
etorri da.
(unaccusative)
Jon(ABS)comeAUX'Jon came.'
This means that some, but not all, monovalent predicate subjects are marked
like transitive objects. The case marking pattern is of an 'extended' ergative
type (Dixon 1979, 1994; also Levin 1983).
This section (4.1) is structured as follows: in section 4.1.2,1 will discuss
intransitive monovalent structures; in section 4.1.3, intransitive bivalent
structures (predicates with two arguments but no ergative case marking); in
section 4.1.4, transitive structures, and in section 4.1.5, ditransitive ones. In
section 4.1.6 we will turn to possessive constructions and the valencymarking alternations they give rise to. In section 4.1.7, verbs of saying,
thinking and judging and their valency structure are discussed.","[392, 393, 394]"
"4.8.2. Causee marking in morphological causatives
This section is devoted to causee marking in morphological causatives,
where the logical subject caused to act may not occur as a subject. This
grammatical function is taken over by the causer, which, if expressed, will
appear in the ergative case. The causee, on the other hand, will take on absolutive or dative marking. The dialectal and argumental factors which rule
the usage of one case marking versus the other are discussed in the following sections. We will examine the case marking of the causee ('logical subject') of intransitive, monotransitive and ditransitive predicates. In order to
make case marking patterns in the examples more illustrative, pronouns are
provided in cases where the nominal would have been dropped in actual
use. These pronouns are inserted in square brackets in corpus examples and
in parentheses in constructed examples.",[626]
"Sometimes, however, only the first pattern is possible. This is generally
the case when pronouns and/or demonstratives are conjoined:
(146) a. zuri
eta niri
you.DAT and I.DAT
'to you and to me'
b. *[zu eta ni]ri
(147) a. hauek eta horiek
'these and those'
b. *[hau eta hori]ek
In these examples, the dative case-ending -(r)i and the plural ending -ek absolutely must be repeated.
The same applies when the demonstratives accompany nouns:
(148) a. Gizoti honek
maneta emakume harekthis.ERG and womanegin dute.that.ERG doAUX'This man and that woman did it.'
b. *[Gizon hau eta emakume har]ek egin dute.
Note, however, the following unusual case.
(149) [ni eta ni bezalako asko]ren iritziz
I
and I like.REL many.GEN opinion.iNSTR
'in the opinion of me and of many like me'Here the genitive ending -en occurs only once, on the larger NP formed from
ni Τ and ni bezalako asko 'many like me'.
Naturally, only the first pattern is possible in the rare cases in which the
conjoined NPs bear different case-suffixes:
(150) Bost umerekin eta oinez
etorri zen Bilbotik.
five child.COM and foot.lNSTR come AUX Bilbao.ABL
'She came from Bilbao with five children and on foot.'",[199]

the shape or order of the morpheme is important, it has been isolated using
hyphens both on the Basque sentence and on the glosses. Otherwise, the
morphemes involved have been identified only on the glosses, separating
them with dots. Dots are also used for cases where several morphemes in
English correspond to the Basque morpheme/word. As usual, lexical items
have been written in normal font, while grammatical morphemes have been
written on small capital characters. Grammatical morphemes difficult to
gloss (such as ba, ote, etc.) are simply given as such in the glosses in italics;
they are included as entries in the index tables at the end of the Grammar.
Full sentences are indicated by capital initials and sentence final period
marks (some quotations are adjusted to this usage if they make up full sentences). Phrases and incomplete or subordinate clauses begin with lower
case characters and are not followed by a period. Example sources are indicated in square brackets. A separate section in the References identifies the
abbreviations used for them.
Nominal inflection
Case endings are glossed with the name of the case, without trying to analyze them further into determiner, number and case ending proper. This information is easily retrievable from the inflection charts offered in chapter
3.2. For reading ease, the gloss for a case is often not the morphological
case label, but its meaning ('with' for coM(itative), etc.). Among grammatical cases, dative is glossed in exactly the same way (DAT or 'to'), and ergative always with the case label (ERG). The zero case, absolutive, is treated
somewhat differently. We have taken it as the default case, so that, unless
otherwise stated, the absence of any case indication on a nominal means it is
in the absolutive case.
Determiners and plural markers are not easily isolatable for most case
endings and we have not tried to identify them in the glosses. Thus,
gizonekin comitative plural is glossed as 'men.with', or 'men.COM', while
the comitative singular gizonarekin is glossed as 'man.with' or 'man.COM'.
The determiner (-a) and the plural marker (-it) are most easily identifiable in
the absolutive case, but here too, we have only identified them where di-viii Notes on glossesrectly relevant. Thus, a noun like etxeak '(the) houses' has been glossed in
full (house.DET.PL) only where the information is important. Otherwise it is
glossed as 'houses'. Similarly, singular etxea is usually glossed as 'house'
and only where needed as 'house.DET'. Nonetheless, both determiner and
plural are identified when they are attached to anything other than a noun
(to adjectives, headless relatives, etc.): etxe handia is always glossed as
'house big.DET\ etxekoak 'house.REL.DET.PL', etc. The Basque texts in section 5 have been glossed with more details. There all case endings have
been separated from the stem and identified, and the latter has always been
glossed in the singular. The case endings thus identified can be easily
checked in the tables provided in section 3.2. As usual, determiners and plural markers have only been identified for the zero case, the absolutive.
Verb glosses
Verbal inflection in finite verbal forms is also glossed in detail only where
directly relevant. Since the only relevant information, outside the chapter on
verbal morphology itself, is person agreement (including person, case and
number morphemes) only that information is specified. Unless PL 'plural' in
explicitly marked, 'singular' is the default value. We have tried to represent
person agreement information in the order in which it appears on the verb.
Thus, subjects will be variously marked to the right or to the left, depending
on whether they are cross-referenced by the ergative or the absolutive
marker. Person morphemes are separated by slashes from each other in
pluripersonal agreement forms. Mood is only marked when the potential or
hypothetical marker -ke is present or when the subjunctive auxiliary is selected, if directly relevant. Where none of this is relevant, only 'AUX' has
been indicated. Full information is given in 3.5.2.
As for aspect information, following Basque grammatical tradition, we
gloss perfective participles as infinitives. This is so because they work as
the unmarked, citation form of the verb. Thus, a form like hartu is glossed
as 'take'. Similarly, the future morpheme -ko is added to this citation, participial form, and we gloss hartuko as take.FUT, disregarding again the 'perfective' aspect marker -tu-. The auxiliary izan 'be' reinforcing perfective
tenses (3.5.4.2.1) or inserted to provide a verbal host for aspectual markers
in verbal locutions (3.5.4.2.2) is always glossed as 'be' regardless of its
grammatical function.
The perfective present form ikusi dut can be translated as a present perfect of simple past in English. Both translations are given for this tense
throughout the grammar. The different tense values are described in 3.5.4.
Finally, some verbal expressions can be analyzed as regular verb+auxiliaryNotes on glosses ixcombinations or as noun/adjective + 'be, have' periphrases: bizi naiz Ί live,
be alive', nahi dut Ί want, have desire'. We have maintained the different
authors' preferences in this area.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"
"'In this dream which can happen we see the Basque language...'
[Mitx. EIG IV:42]
In (1866) the relativized phrase is the subject absolutive phrase. The whole
phrase has the locative case.
- Relativization of a direct object (absolutive case):
(1867JFilologoaerebanaiz,ordea,[behialaemanphilologistalsoba.amhoweverlong.agogivezidaten]tituluakadieraztenduenez-AUX.COMPtitle.ERGsay.lMPFAUX.as'However, I am also a philologist, as the diploma they gave me long
ago says.' [Mitx. EIG IV:74]
In (1867) the relativized phrase is the direct object, and the whole phrase a
subject showing the ergative case.
- Relativization of a nominal predicate.
NPs can be predicates within the relative, as can be seen in the following
example:
(1868)[Naizen]gizonakam.coMPman.ERGnekez
hardlyonetsdezakeaccept(RAD)AUX.POThorrelakorik.
such.thing.PRTT""The man I am can hardly accept things like that.'
- Relativization of a dative phrase:
(1869)[burni hotsa darion]
Bizkaiko
hizkeraz
iron
sound pour.3A/3D.COMP Biscay.REL dialect.lNSTR
'in the dialect of Bizkaia, which pours out an iron sound' [Mitx.
EIG IV:23]Subordination 777In (1869) dario is an inflected form of the verb jario 'pour', an absolutivedative verb, in which the locative-source corresponds to the dative. In the
following example too, the relativized NP is dative, functioning here as an
indirect object:
(1870) Ezagutzenalduzu[liburuakeskatuknow.iMPFQAUXbooksask.fordizkiodan]gizona?","[806, 807]"
"4.10.3.1.6. Morphosyntactic secondary effects linked to relativization hierarchy
Basque has developed more or less marginal ways to lighten the problems
linked to relativization of non-grammatical phrases. We mention three of
them: -ko insertion, use of resumptive pronouns, and non-argumental verbinflection.4.10.3.1.6.1. -ko insertion
The relational suffix -ko is used to make possible for adverbial phrases, and
especially locative phrases, to function as adnominals. As observed above,
relativization of locative phrases, though possible, has some restrictions.
But joining -ko to a relative clause permits the speaker to indicate that the
locative interpretation of the relativized phrase is required. From the point
of view of syntactic analysis, the relative is adverbialized as a headless relative with a locative case: a possibility which is generally restricted to temporal phrases. Adnominalization of the headless relative is then realized by
means of the relational suffix. Consider the following example:782Syntax(1885)[Ό soak
iragaiten
direneko]
haroa
ten.
doves
pass.IMPF
AUX.COMP.REL
season was
'It was the season when pidgeons arrive' [Sarri. Afar.: 10]Without adjunction of -eko to the relative clause, (1885), where the relativized NP is a locative, would be grammatically correct, but more difficult to
interpret. The relational suffix can be added to a plural form:
(1886)[pastoralak eman zirenetako]
herri-izenen
pastorals
give AUX.COMP.PL.REL village-names.GEN
beste zerrenda
other list
'the other list of the names of villages where pastorals have been
presented' [Leku. Ahozko:221]4.10.3.1.6.2. Resumptive pronouns
Since verb-agreement occurs with all grammatical NPs (absolutive, ergative
and dative), it can be considered as a kind of resumptive realization of the
relativized grammatical NP. We won't discuss this point here, restricting resumptive pronouns to independently realized true pronominal forms.
In many languages, resumptive pronouns provide a strategy to facilitate
the interpretation of relativized adverbial or genitive phrases. Actually, this
strategy has been proposed for Basque by some modern grammarians and
among them especially Altube (1929, §125). However, using resumptive
pronouns in relative clauses doesn't represent a strategy Basque-speakers
usually resort to, even with adverbial phrases which are hard to relativize.
Nevertheless, resumptive pronouns are more readily accepted when the relativized NP is embedded within another NP or clause.
The distal demonstrative Qtura) or its emphatic form (bera) can be used
as resumptive pronouns. In (1887) we have an example where the resumptive pronoun bears a non-subcategorized complex case (comitative with
ezkondu 'marry'). Out of context, the example is accepted by some speakers, but it is doubtful the construction is used in natural speech situations:
(1887)%Amerikara
joan da
[berarekin
Americas.ALL go
AUX him.COM
nahi izan zenuen]
mutila.
willhaveAUX.COMPezkondu
marryboy'The boy to whom you wanted to get married to went to America.'","[811, 812]"
"860 Syntax4.11.3.1. Coordination in noun phrases
Problems arise when we want to determine which elements smaller than
postpositional phrases or case-marked noun phrases can be coordinated.
Case endings are attached to the end of the noun phrase. As shown in 3.1,
the structure of the noun phrase can be analyzed by means of the following
template:
Complex Modifier* Adjl Detl Ν Adj2*Det2The first situation under study is the possibility of coordinating two noun
phrases under a single case ending:
[NP and NP] Case
In this pattern, different degrees of unacceptability arise, depending on the
nature and the structure of the noun phrases conjoined. It is never possible
to coordinate noun phrases ending with demonstratives (2152) or plural articles (2153), and the same is true of personal pronouns (2154):
(2152)*Irakasleekneskahuraetamutilhariteachers.ERGgirlthisandboythat.DATdeitudiete.callAUX'The teachers have called this girl and that boy.'
(2153)*Nik lagunak eta ahaideei

"The noun phrase153There is variation in the inflection of the intensives. The forms like neu
and nihaur most often retain the same stems with all case-suffixes, as in ergative neuk and nihaurek, while the forms like nerau usually exhibit the
suppletive stems of the demonstratives, and hence nerau has ergative neronek. But other forms are found.
There are also intensive pronouns for the third person. Most commonly,
we find singular bera 'he himself, she herself, while the plural is variously
bera or berak 'they themselves'. Some northern varieties make a distinction
here, using singular beraur and plural berauk in isolation, but bera to accompany another item, usually a demonstrative: hence beraur but hura
bera, both 'he himself, she herself. Western varieties use only bera in both
functions.
In some eastern varieties, the intensives have an additional use, to express 'by oneself, 'alone'. Examples: Nihaur naiz hemen Ί am alone here';
Pello bera bizi da 'Pete lives alone'.
In all varieties, postposed ber- plus the article makes the ordinary thirdperson intensifier: Igone bera 'Igone herself, liburua bera 'the book itself,
gizonak berak 'the men themselves'. Any case-suffix is added to both elements: Igonek berak egin zuen 'Igone herself did it'. Some northern varieties allow ber to be preposed, with no second article, and hence allow ber
liburua as well as liburua bera for 'the book itself.
In the classical Lapurdian language of the 17th century, a genitive was
obliged to appear in its intensive form if and only if it was coreferential with
another noun phrase (not necessarily the subject) in the same simplex
clause, whether or not that other noun phrase was overtly present. Hence the
classical language made a sharp distinction between (a), with an intensive
genitive and (b), with an ordinary genitive of a demonstrative:
(118) a. Hartu du bere
liburua.
take AUX his.lNTS book
'He took his (own) book.'
b. Hartu du haren liburua.
his'He took his (someone else's) book.'
This distinction, comparable to that in Latin between suus and eius, is no
longer regularly observed today, though its demise is recent (mid-20th century), and Zuberoan still observes it today (see 4.9).
Note, though, that the intensive genitive bere is still used today in all varieties to express 'his/her/its own'.","[182, 183]"
"4.1.5. Ditransitive Structures
4.1.5.1. Trivalent ditransitive
In this group we include all those verbs that can increase their valency with
the addition of a dative-marked argument fulfilling the role of recipient or
beneficiary. They all have therefore a more basic transitive bivalent use. I
exclude from the group those ditransitives that encode a possession relation
between the dative and some other argument of the verb (see section 4.1.6),
the so-called 'datives of interest'. Verbs in this group are (among many others) eman 'give', erosi 'buy', saldu 'sell', esan 'tell', eskeini 'offer', erakutsi 'show', ekarri 'bring', kontatu 'tell', esan 'say' and erantzun 'answer'.
They all involve a notion of transfer from an agent or causer to a recipient
or beneficiary. Verbs that cannot be interpreted as involving a transfer can
have ditransitive forms, but they are invariably of the possessive sort.
The dative argument is doubly marked by case on the noun-phrase and
dative affixes on the auxiliary (see section 4.1.3.6.2 for important restrictions; also Albizu 1997a):
(642) a. Jonekardoa ekarri du.

A few verbs in Basque require ditransitive morphology while showing only
two arguments. They are eritzi 'think, have an opinion about' (see section
7), eutsi 'retain, hold on', and the aspectual verbs ekin 'engage in' and eragon 'keep on, hold on to', as well as eman 'give' in an aspectual usage illustrated in (643 c). Among the aspectual verbs, the last two take noun412Syntaxphrase or nominalized clausal complements, and eman only noun phrases
with an eventive meaning:

I.ERGIn the previous example, the personal pronoun is ergative (nik T ) , and is
followed by an appositive relative in which the first person (subject NP) is
relativized and receives the article followed by the ergative case-marker

vocatives. Sometimes the pronoun itself is gapped and the relative is employed alone, as in example (1906), where the whole vocative phrase is underlined, and the relative clause is put between brackets:

In (1906) the vocative NP is the second person singular, but the pronoun
does not appear before the appositive phrase.",[819]
"4.10.3.1.1.4. Left- and right-branching
In the examples above, the relative clauses precede the head. Indeed, the
prenominal position of relatives is the unmarked position in Basque, almost
obligatory for many speakers in present-day Basque. This is reminiscent of
what happens with genitive phrases, and the complementizer employed in
relatives (-(e)n) has often been considered to be cognate with the genitive
marker (-en), though this remains doubtful, because, unlike the genitive, the
complementizer doesn't seem to be syllabic in its underlying form (-«).
In the past, another word order could be used, and can still be used as a
marked form in modern eastern dialects. In this case the relative clause is
still embedded, but, like an adjective, it follows the head. See (1851):766Syntax(1851)[Eskualdun zahar [zerbait
dakite-n]
-ak]
aide
Basque
old
something k n o w - c O M P -DET.PL side
dituzte.
have
'The old Basques who know something have them on their side.'
[Etch. Bur.-ΛΠ]In (1851) the head is eskualdun 'Basque', and the relative clause follows it
(after the adjective zahar 'old').
Observe that in (1851) the relative clause precedes the determiner (-ak),
which must be at the end of the whole NP. Thus, there is no extraposition of
the relative clause. Actually the relative clause occupies the position that adjectives have in Basque, i.e. to the right of the head-noun, but before the determiner. Thus we have a case of right-branching with regard to the lexical
head of the phrase (the bare noun), but not with regard to its functional head
(the determiner). Hence, the relative clause in (1851) is not the last syntactic
constituent within the whole NP because it is followed by the determiner,
which is actually suffixed to it (-ak).
One should not analyze (1851) as a relative clause having an internal
head. If this were the case, the head (euskalduri) would have the ergative
case-marker which corresponds to it within the relative. Basque doesn't allow this relativization strategy.
Postnominal embedded relatives share all the properties prenominal relatives have, and they must not be considered on a par with the extraposed
relatives studied below.","[795, 796]"
"4.10.3.1.5. Accessibility
4.10.3.1.5.1. Accessibility hierarchy
When a noun phrase can be relativized in a clause, it is said to be accessible
to relative-clause formation. Most of the time, accessibility to relativization
is understood according to the morphosyntactic features of the relativized
NP, and this is the way we take it here.
Basque is an SOV language which uses a gapping strategy for the relativized phrase. Such languages typically have constraints on accessibility, and
so we expect to find constraints in Basque. It is easy to understand how relativization may appear rather difficult in these circumstances, since the relativized phrase, which includes the case-ending, has no overt realization
within the relative clause. Notice, however, that in those cases where the relativized NP agrees with the verb, verb-agreement can be considered as a
kind of resumptive realization of the relativized phrase. Such a situation can
appear in Basque with ergative, absolutive and dative phrases.
It is generally admitted that accessibility displays the following syntactic
hierarchy (cf. Keenan & Comrie [1977, 1979]:
(1863) subject > direct object > indirect object > adverbial
This hierarchy is the one which is found in Basque, as we will presently
show.
First, let us see how the syntactic hierarchy shown in (1863) could be expressed within the Basque case system:
(1864) absolutive & ergative > dative > subcategorized adverbial > adjunct adverbialSubordination775The hierarchy of (1863) is modified in (1864) because a) no superiority regarding accessibility seems to appear in Basque between subjects and objects, b) subcategorized adverbial phrases are easier to relativize than adjunctive adverbial cases. The interpretation of (1864) is as follows:
- Ergative and absolutive NPs can always be relativized without any kind of
restriction, and no hierarchy seems to exist between them in inflected relatives.
- Dative NPs can be quite easily relativized, but relativization of indirect objects, though possible for all speakers, doesn't seem to be as easy as for subjects and direct objects; for instance, more time is needed for processing this
interpretation in examples out of context. On the contrary, dative NPs associated with psych-verbs are easier to relativize than indirect objects.
- Adverbial cases can be relativized, but accessibility is linked to syntactic
(subcategorization), morphological (morphologically single or complex
cases) and semantic-contextual constraints (when the information carried by
the relative is already known, relativization is easier).
There is no sharp division within the different grades of the hierarchy.
Relativization is possible in all four cases, without difficulties in the first
two cases, with restrictions in the third one. As for the fourth possibility of
(1864), it could be said that NPs taking non-subcategorized morphologically
complex cases resist relativization when there is no case-parallellism (see
below 4.10.3.1.5.4).
In the following sentences we show different kinds of relativization. We
only display examples where the relativized phrase and the whole phrase
have. Relative clauses are bracketed and head-nouns are underlined.
- Relativization of a subject phrase which is ergative:
(1865) Hor dauzkagu(...)

In (1865), the relativized phrase in an ergative phrase. The whole phrase is a
direct object and it takes the absolutive case-marker.","[804, 805]"
"Derivation329In some cases what originally was an independent word is, from a synchronic point of view, better seen as a derivational suffix. An example is dun 'having' (originally from the verb du 's/he has it' plus the relative suffix
-,η), which gives rise to formations such as dirudun 'having money,
wealthy' (An alternative etymology for -dun due to de Rijk is the participle
*edun 'have') . In other cases, a suffix has become an independent word.
This is the case with the suffix -(t)asun '-ness' (perhaps of Latin origin)
which has been promoted to the status of an independent word, tasun 'quality, feature'. Given the existence of the word tasun it is not obvious that
words such as anaitasun 'brotherhood', askatasun 'freedom', etc., should be
considered derived words instead of compounds.
Several words which are frequently used as second members of compounds have acquired an initial dental or velar consonant, which originally
had an epenthetical function in some of the compounds in which they occur.
The new consonant-initial form may coexist with the older vowel-initial one
with somewhat different meanings or, in some cases, the older form may
have been replaced. For instance, together with ume 'child; offspring', in
some western dialects we find the word kume 'offspring of an animal' which
undoubtedly derives from reanalysis in words like katakume 'kitty', where
the -k- , was originally epenthetical (perhaps by analogy with some other
word). Another example is tegi 'place; storage room; stable', which most
likely derives from an earlier *egi, its initial t- being the result of reanalysis
in compounds such txerri-tegi 'pig-sty' or lora-tegi 'garden' (flower-place).
Forms like jauregi 'palace' (lord-place), with the older form -egi, would
perhaps have to be considered derived words synchronically, since egi does
not have independent existence nowadays. Another word that has acquired
an initial consonant in this manner is kide 'companion' (cf., e.g. adiskide
'friend' [adin 'age'], lankide 'coworker' [lan 'work'] but ahaide 'relative',
haurride 'sibling' [haur 'child'], gogaide 'person with similar ideas' [gogo
'soul']). Most likely talde 'group' is etymologically related to aide 'side' in
the same manner, although synchronically they must be considered separate
items.
The reasons for the classificatory doubts may also be of a semantic nature. Thus, whereas the word bide 'path, way' is well attested as a free form,
as a bound element it often has the meaning of 'method' when attached to a
verb; e.g.: ikasbide 'method for learning', aurkibide 'table of contents'
(aurki[tu] 'find'), (vs., e.g. ardi-bide 'sheep path', which is a clear compound).
The classificatory problem, then, is whether morphologically complex
words like ardozale 'fond of wine', garbitasun 'cleanliness, quality of being330Morphologyclean', ikasbide 'method for learning' or lorategi 'garden' should be treated
as compounds or as derived words. Basque grammarians do not always
agree in the classification as compounds or derived words of many of these
examples. Here we have followed our own criterion in individual cases.
For presentational purposes, derivational suffixes are classified by the
class of word to which they (most frequently) give rise (i.e. derived nouns,
derived adjectives, etc.) and within each of these types by their most usual
source (e.g. denominal, deverbal, etc.). The few derivational prefixes that
are found are illustrated at the end of the section. A special case is that of
diminutive suffixes, since these never change the category of the word they
are joined to. In a sense, then, diminutives occupy a position between inflection and derivation. These suffixes are treated first.
Several caveats are in order:
— A certain degree of arbitrariness is involved in classifying a given suffix
as denominal, deverbal, etc. Sometimes a suffix is used with more than one
type of stem. In other cases, beside a regular pattern, there are more-or-less
exceptional formations where the stem belongs to a different category.
— Classification of a given suffix as noun-deriving or adjective-deriving is
not always a straightforward matter.
— A number of suffixes have more than one usage or meaning.
These details are made explicit in the description of each suffix. The
classificatory labels used in this section represent only the unmarked or
most common case for each suffix.","[358, 359, 360]"
"116MorphologyAs a rule, animate noun phrases are inflected just like inanimate ones:
hence, with mendia 'the mountain', we have absolutive plural mendiak and
ergative plural mendiek, and, with gizona 'the man', we have absolutive plural gizonak and ergative plural gizonek, and so on. However, animate NPs
frequently form all their local cases differently from inanimate NPs. Hence,
'in/on the mountains' is mendietan, but 'in/on the men' is commonly
gizonengan (or northern gizonen baitan). See section 3.2.2.4 for the forms.
The local cases are the Locative, the Ablative, the Allative, and the compound cases formed on the Allative: Directional, Terminative and Destinative. This distinction is adhered to rather rigorously in western dialects, but
less so in eastern dialects. Eastern varieties sometimes use inanimate forms
with animate NPs, above all when the local sense is abstract or metaphorical, rather than literal. For example, we find the following:
(62) Nik ez dut konfidentzirik
honelako gizonetan.
I
not have confidence.PRTT such
man.PL.LOC.
Ί don't have any confidence in men like that'. [Xalbador]
But even literal senses sometimes appear with inanimate inflections:
(63) Hurazalu, goaitzagozkon senareta haurretarat.s/heagile waitwereand child.PL.ALLhusband'She hurried off to the husband and children who were waiting for
her.' [Hiriart Urruty]
This eastern usage is particularly common when the NP is plural and generic,
or when it is a personal pronoun, but it is not confined to such cases.
But, in all varieties, an animate noun phrase regularly takes the inanimate
forms of certain local cases to provide the special sense of 'among'. Thus,
the ordinary locative of zazpi alabak 'the seven daughters' is zazpi alabengan 'in/on the seven daughters', but the inanimate form zazpi alabetan
means 'among the seven daughters'. Likewise, gizonak 'the men' forms an
ordinary ablative gizonengandik 'from the men', but inanimate gizonetatik
means 'from among the men'.","[145, 146]"
"4.10.2.2.1. Adjunct structures based on the verbal noun
The verbal noun, formed with the suffix -t(z)e, may practically take any of
the inflectional suffixes that regular noun phrases take. We already discussed the use of absolutive dative or ergative nominalized clauses, in the
section of complement structures. We also included there nominalized
clauses with the allative case-ending (-ra) and regarded them as complement clauses:
(1760)Ogiaerosteranoa.breadbuy.NOM.ALLgo'I'm going to buy bread.'
In this section we will mention the most possibilities for adjunct nominalized clauses, without attempting to provide a complete list.
4.10.2.2.1.1. Nominalized clauses and the spatio-temporal case-endings
Very frequently, the verbal noun can take the allative case-ending -ra to
form a non-finite conditional sentence:
(1761) Gaixorikegonzarelajakitera,lehenagoAUx.elakno W. NOM. ALLbeforesick.PRTTbeetorrikonintzen.come.FUTAUX'If I had known you were sick, I would've come before.'
The locative suffix -n is also a frequent possibility to form temporal adjuncts:
(1762) a. Etxera
home.ALLheltzean,Mirenideitukodiot.arrive.NOM.LOCMiren.DATcall.FUTAUXΊ will call Miren upon arriving home.'",[767]
"3.1.2.5.6. Time of day
An hour of the clock is expressed by adding the plural article -ak to the numeral, except that 'one o'clock' and 'two o'clock' require the numeral to be
preceded by ordu 'hour':
Table 44. Time of day
ordu batak
ordu biak
hirurak
laurak'one o'clock'
'two o'clock'
'three o'clock' (cf. Sp las tres)
'four o'clock'And so on. Note the usual plural form of 'one o'clock', even though the
Academy has decreed that the standard form should be ordu bata. Eastern
varieties use oren for 'hour', and 'one o'clock' is oren bata, singular. Minutes or fractional hours after the hour are expressed by using eta 'and' plus
the appropriate addition: ordubiak eta hamar '2:10', hamabiak eta laurdenThe noun phrase131'12:15', zazpiak eta erdi '7:30'. Minutes or fractions before the hour are expressed with gutxi 'little': zazpiak hamar gutxi 'ten to seven', ordubatak
laurden gutxi 'a quarter to one'. English 'at' is expressed by adding the
locative case-ending: ordu bietan 'at two o'clock'; ordubi t'erdietan 'at
two-thirty'.
3.1.2.6. Quantifiers
Quantifiers vary in their placement. Some appear in the DETL position, others in the DET2 position. In the first group are zenbat 'how many?' 'how
much?' and hainbat and hainbeste 'so many, so much, that many, that
much'. In the second group are batzu(k) 'several, some', guti ~ gutti ~ gutxi
'few, little, not much, not many', gehiago 'more' and gehiegi 'too much'.
Many others are regionally variable, being in some places preposed but in
others postposed. Among these are (h)anitz 'much, many, lots o f , zenbait
'several, some', aski 'enough' and asko 'many, much, lots o f : asko diru or
diru asko 'lots of money'. (This asko formerly meant 'enough' in the east.)
Naturally, the presence of a quantifier normally prohibits any other determiner from appearing (though see section 3.1.2.9 for two major exceptions). Consequently, an NP with a quantifier is not usually overtly marked
for number. Examples:
Table 45. NP with quantifier
hanitz jende
zenbait ume
jende gutxi
diru gehiago'lots of people'
'several children'
'few people'
'more money'However, the addition of the article is by no means rare here, and we find
examples like merezi hainitzak 'many virtues' in the writer Haramburu, for
expected merezi hainitz (here hainitz is a variant of hanitz), and we hear urte
askoan 'in many years', with the article, for expected indefinite urte askotan. Some speakers regard this odd use as being in some way ""expressive"". In eastern varieties, anitz can take a plural article to form the pronoun
anitzak 'lots of people'.
The quantifier oro 'all', today confined to eastern dialects, exhibits
unique behavior: it functions as a kind of appositive, following a complete
NP with a determiner. Compare mendiak '(the) mountains' with mendiak oro
'all the mountains'. If the NP is case-marked, the case-marker may be repeated on oro, and so the ergative case-form of this last example is mendiek132Morphologyorok, with ergative -k appearing twice (note the absence of the article; the
form *mendiek oroek is impossible). Likewise, 'on all the mountains' is
mendietan orotan, with repetition of the locative case-ending, though mendi
orotan also occurs and is now perhaps the norm with non-argument (adverbial) cases. The same behavior is sometimes exhibited by the adjective
guz(t)i 'all', and so, in place of normal mendi guztiak 'all the mountains',
we occasionally find mendiak guztiak. This is usual when a demonstrative is
present: mendi horietan guztietan 'on all those mountains'.
In fact, the behavior of quantifiers is often regionally highly variable and
idiosyncratic. For example, with franko 'a whole bunch of', we find in use
all offranko gizon, gizon franko, gizona franko and gizonak franko.
Certain words with quantifier-like meanings are strictly adjectives, including guzti ~ guzi 'all', bakoitz 'each', gehien 'most' and ugari 'abundant,
numerous': etxe guztiak 'all the houses', ikasle bakoitza 'each student',pilotari gehienak 'most jai-alai players', janari ugaria 'abundant food'. But gehiago 'more' and gehiegi 'too much, too many' are determiners, and they do
not co-occur with another determiner: lan gehiago 'more work', diru gehiegi 'too much money'.","[160, 161, 162]"
"4.10.3.1.6.3. Non-grammatical number agreement
Since the verb agrees with NPs having grammatical cases, the inflected verb
retains the agreement marker corresponding to them. In such cases we can
say that the agreement marking corresponds to some kind of resumptive
marking. Consider now the following two examples:
(1889) Non
dira [ekarri dituzun]
liburuak?
where are bring
AUX.COMP books
'Where are the books you brought?'
(1890) Non
dira [ekartzeko
esan nizkizun]
where are bring.NOM.REL tell
AUX.COMP
'Where are the books I told you to bring?'liburuak?
booksIn (1889) the relativized NP is the absolutive NP and the inflected auxiliary
bears the number agreement marker corresponding to it {-it-). In (1890) we
have apparently the same situation, since the inflected auxiliary carries the
plural agreement marker (-zkiV) corresponding to the relativized NP. However, in (1889) the relativized NP is the direct object of the inflected verb784 Syntaxand agreement is regular, but this is not so in (1890), where the relativized
NP is not the object of the inflected verb (esan 'tell'). Nevertheless the inflected auxiliary contains a plural agreement marker (-zki-) which corresponds to agreement with the relativized NP. Of course, without relativization such agreement is absolutely excluded:
(1891)*Liburuakekartzekoesannizkizun.booksbring.NOM.RELtellAUXΊ told you to bring the books.'
When the relativized NP belongs to a clause embedded within the relative,
there is a tendency to make the highest verb within the relative clause agree
(in number) with the relativized absolutive NP, even if the latter isn't subcategorized by this verb. The phenomenon is reminiscent of clitic climbing
in Romance languages. This non-grammatical agreement, though not
obligatory, is more widely accepted by many present-day speakers. To most
of them, (1890) sounds more natural than (1892) which is the 'correct'
form:
(1892) Ν on
dira ekartzeko
esan nizun
where are bring.NOM.REL tell
AUX.COMP
'Where are the books I told you to bring?'liburuak?
booksIn some cases, this type of agreement gives rise to morphologically aberrant forms. See the following example, where a genitive NP corresponding
to an object has been relativized (see 3.5.5.1.2):
(1893) Ez
notnituenaurkitu[bilanenbiltzan]AUXfindsearchinglA.SG.walk.PL.PST.C0MPargitasunak.
explanations
Ί didn't find the explanations I was looking for.' [adapted from
Mitx. EIG VI: 166]
The verb in (1893) is bila ibili 'look for', a complex expression where ibili
'walk, be active in' is inflected. With bila ibili, the subject NP takes the absolutive case, and the object the genitive case (see above [4.10.3.1.4.3]).
The verb in (1893) is morphologically aberrant: on the one hand, it bears
agreement with the absolutive subject (first person singular), on the other, it
carries the plural agreement marker as if the subject were plural. Indeed,
number agreement is only linked to absolutive case marking in Basque, andSubordination785the verb in the relative clause should only agree with its subject. But this is
not the case in (1893), because in fact the plural marking within the verb
(-tza-) corresponds to agreement with the relativized NP (something irregular, since genitive NPs don't have verb agreement). The regular form for
(1893) would be (1894):
(1894) Ez
notnituenaurkitubilanenbilenAUXfindsearchinglA.walk.PST.coMPargitasunak.
explanationsΊ didn't find the explanations I was looking for.'
Even though (1894) is correct, (1893) sounds better to many people. In fact,
(1893) is attested (though slightly adapted here for the sake of clarity) in
Mitxelena's text. When he corrected his paper before publishing it, Mitxelena added a note explaining that, although nenbiltzan was a true freak
from the point of view of the verb morphology, he didn't want to correct it,
because, as a speaker, he didn't find it so bad.","[813, 814, 815]"

one it would receive from the verb in the subordinate clause). One such example appears in Etxepare's 1545 poems:
(1988) Konduhertsibehar dugu harzazemanaccountcarefulneedgivesegurki[noribaitubereodolazsurelywho.DATbait.AUXhisblood.lNSTRAUXthat.lNSTRkario erosi].
dear buy
'Surely, we must give a careful account [for our soul] to the one
who redeemed it with his blood at such a high price.' [Etx:109-110]
In (1988) the dative wh-word (nori) is the indirect object within the main
clause. If the case corresponded to its role in the subordinate clause, it
would have been ergative.
Unlike the first construction (1987a), the second construction (1987b)
with a non finite verb within the subordinate clause is found in all dialects
of present-day Basque. It is used especially with verbs like *edun or eduki
'have', and izan, egon 'be' when they express existence and possession, respectively. The wh-word within the subordinate clause can receive any case.
Crucially, it can be subject and receive the ergative case; therefore, the construction must be distinguished from control structures found in other contexts. Consider the following example (Bizkaian dialect, 20th century):
(1989)[Nokeman] baleukieorrekjangowho.ERGgivethey.ERGeat.FUT AUX.POTif.had.POTleukie'If they had somebody to give it to them, they would eat it.' [Kir.
Egun: 39]
In (1989) the wh-word within the non finite clause is ergative. In eastern
dialects, the non finite verb appears in the radical form. This is the case in
(1986) where the verb is pausa 'lay', radical of the past participle pausatu.
In western dialects, the participial is used, and it is often nominalized taking
the definite article or the partitive. For instance, Matthew 8,20 is expressed
in a Gipuzkoan version as in (1990) where the participle takes the partitive:Subordination 823(1990)GizonarenSemeak,ordean,ezdu[buruaman.GENson.ERGhowevernothasheadnonezarririk].whereput.PRTT'But the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.' [Orix. Mat 8,20]
In older texts the subordinate clauses appear with finite forms. These were
subjunctive forms as shown in (1991) below:
(1991)Gizonarensemeakezdiknonbereman.GENson.ERGnothas(ALLOC)wherehisburuareposadezan.head.DETput(RAD)AUX(SUBJ).COMP'But the son of man has nowhere to lay his head.' [Leiz. Mat 8,20]
Example (1991) is taken from the translation of the gospels by Leizarraga
(16th century) and it must be compared here with (1986) and (1990). In
(1991) the subordinate clause is finite, and the inflected verb form is the
auxiliary *ezan in subjunctive form (dezan). Such forms are not used in present day Basque and look quite archaic. However, they were still used in the
18th century by writers such as Larramendi and Mogel in western dialects:
(1992)Ez dago [nok
egin
not is
who.ERG make
penitenzijarik].dagijan
AUX(SUBJ).COMPpenance.PRTT'There is nobody to do penance.' [Mog. Konf.:29]
The example is extracted from a Bizkaian text by Mogel (1803). In this dialect, the transitive auxiliary for subjunctive forms is egin (dagijan) instead
of *ezan (dezan).","[851, 852, 853]"
"4.10.3.4.1. Appositive relative clauses constructed with relative pronouns
Relative clauses constructed with relative pronouns occur in the written tradition of all dialects since the beginning of Basque literature in the 16th century. They did not really penetrate everyday spoken Basque, but they were
widely used in written texts, not only in books, but also in less formal registers; they were employed, for instance, in sermons and correspondence. At
the end of the 19th century, language consciousness led many to reject elements of the language taken from Romance languages, especially those that
were not essential and not fully integrated into the popular language. This
attitude was general. It was found among writers of western Basque dialects
who were under the strong influence of linguistic purism, but it also occurred among easterners, who, though usually opposed to the form of purism promoted on the other side of the border, tried to keep written Basque
based on the spoken language as far as possible. Most of the grammarians
during the first two thirds of the 20th century considered these relatives as
not genuine and Lafitte (1944) did not pay much attention to them, considering they were mere gibberish. Nowadays there is no such condemnation
against these relatives, and no grammarian would consider that they do not
belong in the language. Nevertheless, it should be said that their use is more
or less marginal, and far from being as wide as it was until around 1880.
The most salient characteristics of these relative clauses are illustrated in
(1957). They follow the antecedent and are appositive or extraposed rela-810 Syntaxtives. They contain a relative pronoun built on the wh-word zein 'which'
(non 'where' in local cases); this pronoun receives the case ending that corresponds to it within the relative, and zein can receive the definite article as
well. The verb within the relative receives either -(e)n or bait- as a complementizer:
(1957) Hiltzenditubelar gaixtoak,[zeinekAUXgrassbad.DET.PLwhich.PL.ERGirestenbaitutelurrakogiariswallow.IMPFbait.AUXearth.ERGwheat.DATkill.IMPFeman behar lukeen
gozoa].
give need AUX.POT.COMP nourishment
'It kills the weeds, which swallow the nourishment that the earth
should give to the wheat.' [Duv. L.L.:72]
In (1957) the relative clause is bracketed. The antecedent is belar gaixto
'weed' which carries the plural absolutive suffix (-ak). The relative clause
follows the antecedent. Its first constituent is the relative pronoun zein
'which', with the plural ergative suffix (-ek). The inflected verb form within
the relative receives the prefix bait- as complementizer (baitute).","[839, 840]"
"3.1.3.3. Adjective comparison
Adjectives are compared by suffixation: comparative -ago, superlative -en,
excessive -egi. With handi 'big': handiago 'bigger', handien 'biggest',
handiegi 'too big'. All these forms pattern just like simple adjectives: gizon
handiagoa 'the bigger man', gizon handiena 'the biggest man', gizon
handiegia 'the man who is too big'.
Only one adjective compares irregularly: on 'good' has the comparative
höbe 'better', not *onago (the redundant form hobeago 'more better' is
found dialectally). The superlative is variously the regular onen and the irregular hobe(r)en\ the excessive is always onegi.
Naturally, some adjectives have meanings which do not allow them to be
compared, such as hil 'dead', nagusi 'chief, principal', guzti ~ guzi 'all' and
eme 'female' (except that eme can also mean 'soft', in which case it allows a
comparative emeago 'softer', etc.).
There is no comparison of inferiority. Recently a few writers have selfconsciously introduced a construction involving gutxiago 'less', the comparative of gutxi 'little, not much': garesti gutxiagoa 'less expensive'. It
cannot be said that this coinage has yet found a secure place in the language.
In a comparative phrase, the order is standard—pivot—adjective, and the
pivot is baino 'than' or bezain 'as...as':
(105) a. Jon Patxi baino handiagoa
da.
Jon Patxi than tall.more.DET is
'Jon is taller than Patxi.'
b. Jon Patxi bezain handia da.
Jon Patxiastall.DET is'Jon is as tall as Patxi.'
The standard takes any case-ending logically required. So, in the following
example we find the ergative case-suffix -k on the standard Patxi, which is
logically the subject of an understood transitive verb
(106) AnakPatxikbaino sagardoAna.ERG Patxo.ERG thancider'Ana makes better cider than Patxi.'hobeaegiten du.better.DET make AUXThe noun phrase 141It is difficult to construct comparatives of adjectives inside noun phrases:
speakers reject the following, and require another construction, such as a
relative clause:
(107) *Gizon zu
manyoubaino handiago
thanbatek esan dit.big.more.DET onesayAUXΆ man taller than you told me.'
With a superlative, the group from which the superlative is extracted is
usually marked by a noun phrase in the ablative, if definite; since the sense
of 'from among' is present, the inanimate form of the ablative is used even
with an animate NP: hence, 'the biggest of the men' is gizonetatik handiena.
Eastern varieties can also use the locative, as in gizonetan indartsuena 'the
strongest of the men'. However, if the group is indefinite, it is denoted by a
noun phrase marked only with partitive -ik: gizonik handiena 'the biggest of
men'. See 4.10.4 for more information on the syntax of comparative and superlative constructions.","[170, 171]"
"3.1.4.1. Genitives
Virtually any noun phrase may take the genitive suffix -en to produce a
complex modifier. The genitive can express almost any sort of relation,
though there are limitations described in the last paragraph of this section.
Examples:
Table 49. Genitives
Mufiagorri-ren bertsoak
ogi-en mirakulua
herri pintore-en lanetan
Euskal Herriko artist-en eragina
nere aita-ren etxea
gure herriaren larriminaren lekukoa'Munagorri's verses'
'the miracle of the loaves'
'in the works of popular painters'
'the influence of the artists of the Basque Country'
'my father's house'
'a witness to [lit. ' o f ] the suffering of our144MorphologyThe personal pronouns form their genitives in an irregular manner, as seen
in table 50. Of the first-singular forms, ene is the oldest and quite enigmatic;
nere is a reduced form of intensive neure 'my own'; and nire is an analogical formation of recent origin.
With kinship terms and names denoting a member of one's immediate
family, it is possible to use gure 'our' rather than nere (and variants) 'my':
gure amona 'our grandmother', gure Jon 'our Jon'. In the past, this usage
was normal, and was almost categorical with aita 'father': an older Basque
usually says gure aita rather than nere aita. However, such use of gure is
markedly less prominent among younger Basques today.

'our'
'your' (unmarked SG.)
'your' (plural)In elevated styles, it is also possible, when the genitive is a personal pronoun, to invert the normal construction and to place the genitive after the
head noun, in which case the definite article must be used, even with a
proper name: aita gurea 'our father', Jon gurea 'our Jon'. This construction
is not normal in ordinary styles.
In order to express a genitive-like relation which involves the notion of
location, Basque uses, not a genitive, but a -ko phrase. Compare the genitives in etxearen izena 'the name of the house' and etxearen kolorea 'the
color of the house' with the -ko phrases in etxeko andrea 'the lady of the
house' and etxeko atea 'the door of the house'. In other words, Basque uses
a -ko phrase, rather than a genitive, to express the relations 'who/which is
located in', 'who lives in', 'who/which comes from', 'which forms part o f ,
and similar local notions. See the next section.
3.1.4.2. -ko phrases
The relational suffix -ko is of central importance, and it is exceedingly frequent. Its principal function may be readily described: any constituent of
adverbial function, regardless of its internal structure, may take the suffix
-ko to produce an adjectival modifier which precedes its head noun. The
only limitations on this process are semantic ones. The addition of -ko produces irregular phonological developments in certain cases: the final -n of aThe noun phrase145locative or comitative NP or of the manner suffix -lan is lost before -ko (adverbs of place are sometimes exceptions), and the locative singular ending an disappears entirely. As usual, the plosive is voiced after /n/ or N.
The suffix may be added to any of the following.
(a) a simple lexical adverb
atzo 'yesterday'; atzoko egunkaria 'yesterday's newspaper'
hemen 'here'; hemengo giroa 'the atmosphere here'
gero 'later, afterward'; geroko bizitza 'the afterlife'
The adverb orduan 'then', which is historically the locative singular of
the noun ordu 'hour', usually forms the -ko phrase orduko 'of that time'; see
(d) below.
(b) an adverb of manner formed with -la(n)
hola(n) 'thus, in this way' (from hon- 'this'); holako lana 'this kind of
work'; zelan 'how?' (from ze- interrogative); zelako pertsona? 'what kind
of person?'
(c) a morphologically complex adverb
zirt edo zart 'decisively', zirt-edo-zarteko gizona 'a decisive man'; hitzez
hitz 'literally, word for word', hitzez hitzeko itzulpena 'a word-for-word
translation'; egunero 'every day' (from egun 'day'), eguneroko gertaerak
'everyday events'.
(d) an NP marked for any local case
mendietan 'in the mountains', mendietako haitzuloak 'the caves in the
mountains'; orduan 'then, at that time', orduko ohiturak 'the customs of that
time'; Bilbora 'to Bilbao', Bilborako bidea 'the road to Bilbao'; gizonetatik
'from among the men', gizonetatiko batzuk 'some of the men'.
(e) an NP marked for comitative case
gurekin ~ gurekila 'with us', gurekiko umeak ~ gurekilako haurrak 'the
children (who are/were) with us'146Morphology(f) an NP marked for instrumental case (in certain circumstances)
euskaraz 'in Basque'; euskarazko hitzaldia 'a lecture (given) in Basque'
egiaz 'in truth, truly', egiazko esaldia 'a true statement'
The combination -z-ko is in fact very common in deriving adjectives of material, as in urrezko 'golden, made of gold', from urre 'gold', but is probably best regarded as a single distinct word-forming suffix, rather than as a
true -ko phrase — though note that such formations occupy the normal position of a -ko phrase.
(g) a postpositional phrase
lotsa gäbe 'without shame'; lotsagabeko emakume bat 'a shameless
woman'; gerra ondoan 'after the war'; gerra-ondoko mundua 'the post-war
world'
(h) an adverb constructed from a determinerless NP or other sequence by
means of the suffix -ka
esku-huska 'bare-handed' (ADV) (from esku 'hand' plus huts 'bare' plus
-ka)', esku-huskako pilota partida 'a game of bare-handed pilota'; bai ala ez
'yes or no'; bai-ala-ezkako galderak 'yes-or-no questions'
(i) an adverbial participle in -ta or -(r)ik (together with its arguments and adjuncts)
erosita 'having (been) bought'; atzo nik erositako liburua 'the book I
bought yesterday'; ekarririk 'having (been) brought'; txoriak kabira ekarririko abarra 'the branch brought to the nest by the bird'
In general, the -ta participle is used in the west, the -(r)ik participle in the
east and to some extent in B. This construction represents the only way in
which an adjectival participle can take arguments and adjuncts in western
varieties; see section 3.1.3.5 for an alternative construction in eastern dialects, and see also section 3.1.4.4 for yet another possibility in eastern dialects.
(j) a finite adverbial clause (only in certain circumstances, notably with
temporal clauses, since most other formations would be senseless):The noun phrase(109) a. izarra agertu zitzaienean
star
appear AUX.(COMP).LOC
'when the star appeared to them'

doves pass.IMPF AUX.COMP.LOC
'when the doves pass over'
b. usoak iragaiten direneko
haroa
AUX.COMP.REL season
'the season when doves pass over'
(k) a finite complement clause in -la (only with a following head noun
meaning 'story, report, rumor' or the like)
(111)a. hil dute-la
kill AUX-that
'that he has been killed'b. hil dutelakokontuaAUX.that.REL report
'the report that he has been killed'The only major exception is that -ko cannot be added to an adverb of
manner derived from an adjective, so that, for example, gaizki 'badly' (from
gaitz 'bad') cannot form *gaizkiko. But this restriction has an obvious semantic basis: the non-existent *gaizkiko could have no meaning distinct
from that of gaitz.
On occasion an adverbial source for the -ko phrase is difficult to identify:
ARGIA aldizkari-ko zuzendaria 'the editor of the magazine ARGIA'. Here
ARGIA aldizkaria 'the magazine ARGIA' takes the suffix -ko even though
there is no source: we cannot describe, the editor as being 'in' the magazine
(ARGIA aldizkariaren zuzendaria is also possible).
There exists a second type of -ko phrase, quite different from the paradigm cases described above and similar to descriptive genitives in other languages. Here the suffix is added, not to an adverbial, but to a determinerless
NP; this sequence must consist of at least two words (with a few exceptions
like adineko, edadeko 'elderly, of age'), it must express a quality or characteristic, and there are obscure semantic restrictions:148MorphologyTable 51. -ko phrases

hiru urteko ume bat
beso ederreko pilotaria'a two-pronged pitchfork'
'a good hearted girl'
'a three-year-old child'
'a jai-alai-player with a great
arm'These formations have no adverbial source: we cannot, for example,
speak of a child who is 'in three years' (hiru urtetan), and even if we could
the form is wrong: we would expect *hiru urtetako ume bat. This last is impossible in the western varieties from which the example is taken, though it
is possible in the east, and similar examples are found in early texts.
In addition, we have a number of strictly lexicalized -ko phrases, such as
nahiko 'enough' (nahi 'want') and herriko 'popular, vernacular' (herri
'people'); these have meanings which are at least partly opaque, and they
are therefore normally entered separately in dictionaries, but syntactically
they behave like other -ko phrases.
We find a few other miscellaneous and idiosyncratic instances of -ko
phrases. A striking one is balizko 'hypothetical', which occurs in the familiar proverb Balizko olak burdinarik ez Ά hypothetical forge doesn't [produce] any iron'; this derives from the finite verb-form balitz 'if it were'.
Only in a handful of lexicalizations does a -ko phrase follow its head
noun. This occurs, for example, in Jaungoikoa 'God', from jaun 'lord' and
goiko, a -ko phrase formed from goian 'in a high place', and also in zezensuzko 'toro de fuego', from zezen 'bull' and the -ko phrase suzko, from su
'fire' and instrumental -z (this is a papier-mache figure of a bull covered in
fireworks and displayed at festivals). (Eastern varieties often prefer the more
regular suzko zezen.)
See also section 3.1.7.1 for the occasional use of postposed -ko phrases in
personal names.
See section 4.10.3 for the somewhat specialized use of -ko in relative
clauses.","[173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178]"
"The noun phrase1493.1.4.3. Relative clauses
The formation of relative clauses is treated in detail in section 4.10.3. Here
we note only that a relative clause is a complex modifier and thus precedes
its head, as in
(112) [loreak eman dizkiodan] neska
flowers give AUX.COMP girl
'the girl [I gave the flowers to]'3.1.4.4. Participles
In eastern varieties (only), there exists a fourth type of complex modifier.
This consists of the perfective participle of a verb (transitive or intransitive),
often accompanied by arguments and adjuncts, but with no further suffix on
the participle. Apart from the absence of any suffixes on the participle, this
construction is similar to the type of -ko phrase discussed in section 3.1.4.2
(i), and it is an alternative to the postposed eastern construction described in
section 3.1.3.5. Example:
(113) nik erosi
I
buyliburua
book'the book I bought/the book bought by me'3.1.5. Noun phrases lacking head nouns
There is no requirement that an NP must contain a head noun, and NPs with
empty heads are exceedingly common. Examples:
Table 52. Genitives
gorri-a-k
nere-a
Bilbo-ko-a-k
bi berri
gu-re-kila-ko-a-k'the red ones'
'mine'
'the ones in Bilbao' (often 'the people in Bilbao')
'two new ones'
'the ones (who are/were) with us'Note in particular that a complex modifier, such as a genitive or a -ko
phrase, may modify such a headless noun phrase; for example, from
mendietan 'in the mountains' we can form the -ko phrase mendietako, which150Morphologycan take a null head and the article to produce mendietakoa 'the one in the
mountains'. This process is recursive, and the last noun phrase can take a
genitive suffix to form the genitive mendietakoaren, which can again take a
null head and an article to yield mendietakoarena 'the one belonging to the
one in the mountains', which can take (say) a dative case-suffix to give
mendietakoarenari 'to the one belonging to the one in the mountains'. Such
recursive formations with multiple null heads are perfectly normal in context, but they have been misunderstood by some Basque grammarians, who
have tried to analyze them as single nouns with multiple case-suffixes and
who have consequently applied the label 'superdeclension' to such formations. The superdeclension analysis is quite wrong.
The only inflectional suffix that can be recursively repeated is the genitive: gizonarena 'the one of the man', gizonarenarena 'the one of the one of
the man', etxekoarena 'the one of the house', etxekoarenarena 'the one of
the one of the house'. In particular, -ko does not allow this type of recursivity: *etxekokoa.
The animacy of a headless NP is determined by the animacy of its understood head. For example, beltza 'the black one' takes animate morphology
when denoting a horse but inanimate morphology when denoting a skirt.","[178, 179, 180]"
"3.2.6. Functions and dialectal variants of inflectional suffixes
Absolutive. This case is morphologically unmarked. The endings -a (singular), -ak (plural) and -ok (proximal plural) in the tables above in 3.2.2.1 are
the definite articles, for whose distribution see section 3.1.2.2.
Absolutive noun phrases (morphologically unmarked) play several distinct syntactic functions. First of all, the direct object is in the absolutive
case (it may also take partitive inflection, see below):180Morphology(152) Zakurr-a ikusi du.
dog-DET seeAUX'S/he has seen the dog.'
The absolutive is also the case of the subject of most intransitive predicates (but some intransitive verbs require arguments in the ergative case, see
below):
(153) a. Zakurr-a etorri da.
dog-DET come AUX'The dog has come.'
b. Gizon-adator.man-DET is.coming'The man is coming.'
In the progressive construction with ari (see 3.5.5.1.1) both subject and
direct object appear in the absolutive in transitive constructions:
(154) Nire lagun-aeskutitz-aidazten ari da.my friend-DET letter-DET write
' M y friend is writing the letter.'ari AUXIn copulative sentences both subject and nominal predicate are in the absolutive:
(155) Nire lagun-a
mygure herri-kofriend-DET ourtown-RELalkate-ada.mayor-DET is'My friend is the mayor of our town.'
Vocatives are also in the absolutive (non-case-marked) form, either with
or without the article (somewhat idiosyncratically): mutil! 'boy!', gizon-a!
'man!', bai, jaun-a! 'yes, sir!', adiskide(a)! 'friend!', aspaldiko! 'old
friend!', jaun-andre-ok! 'ladies and gentlemen!'.
Ergative. All ergative noun phrases end in -k. In standard Basque, absolutive plural and ergative singular forms are identical (-ak ending), while the
ergative plural ending is -ek. This reflects the situation in eastern dialects. In
many central and western dialects all three forms are identical. In other
western varieties, however, there is an accentual difference between singularPostpositions181and plural, the plural being accentually marked (see section 2.2.1). In the
Gernika area of Bizkaia, for instance, we find unaccented gixonak 'the man,
ergative singular' vs. accented gixonak 'the men, absolutive or ergative plural'. Similarly, in some Gipuzkoan areas: gizonak 'the man, ergative singular' contrasts with gizonak 'the men, absolutive or ergative plural'.
The ergative is the case of transitive subjects:
(156) Gizon-a-kzakurr-a ikusi du.man-DET-ERG dog-DET seeAUX'The man has seen the dog.'
(157) Nire lagun-a-keskutitz-amy
friend-DET-ERG letter-DET
' M y friend will write the letter.'idatzikodu.write.FUTAUXSome intransitive verbs (unergatives) take transitive morphology, including
the subject in the ergative case (see 4.1.4):
(158) Presidente-a-k
dimititu du.
president-DET-ERG resign AUX
'The president has resigned.'
Dative. The standard forms of the dative suffixes are indefinite -(r)i, singular -ari and plural -ei. In northeastern dialects the dative plural has the suffix
-er, e.g.: gizoner 'to the men' (standard gizonei). In many western and central varieties the dative singular and plural have the same ending, but as
noted above, in some of these varieties there is a contrast in accentuation between the singular and indefinite on the one hand and the plural, on the
other. For instance, in the Gernika area of Bizkaia, the contrast is unaccented gixonari 'to the man', lau gixoneri 'to four men', vs. accented
gixonari 'to the men', lau gixonari 'to the four men'; and in some Gipuzkoan areas, we have gizonai 'to the man' vs. gizonai 'to the men'.
The dative is the case of the indirect object:
(159) Mikel-ek andre-a-ri
M.ERGeman diolady-DET-DAT givediru-a.","[209, 210, 211]"
"4.11.5. Nonconstituent coordination
Coordination has often been used as a test to determine constituenthood.
Nevertheless, it has long been noted that the results of this test sometimes
seem contradictory. For instance, consider examples (2275) and (2276):
(2275)[Joxerenliburu] eta[Mirenenaldizkari]berriakJoxe.GENbookMiren.GENmagazinenew.DET.PLand'Joxe's (new) books and Miren's new magazines'
(2276) Joxeren
Joxe.GEN[liburu berri] eta[aldizkarizaharr]akbookmagazineold.DET.PLnewand'Joxe's new books and old magazines'
In the first example the coordination test would produce the result that the
prenominal modifier and the noun form a constituent (which is not the
case), while in the second the noun and the adjective would be grouped together. Some devices have been proposed to overcome these problems (deletion, empty categories..).. Moreover, we find sometimes examples where
the elements grouped by coordination can hardly be considered constituents.
For example, in (2277), in one of its interpretations, we could advance an
analysis where the noun, the adjective and the article are grouped in one
constituent:
(2277) Joxeren
Joxe.GEN[liburu zaharrak]eta[aldizkari berriak]bookandmagazineold.DET.PLnew.DET.PL'Joxe's old books and new magazines'
But if we follow this line of argumentation, in an example like (2278) the
prenominal modifier would be outside of the constituent formed by the
noun, the article and the case marker:888Syntax(2278) Herriko
[elbarriei]
eta
town.REL disabled.DAT and
opariak eman dizkiete.
giftsgive[zaharrei]
old.DATgabon
ChristmasAUX'They have given Christmas gifts to the disabled and elderly of the
town.'
The same situation arises with prenominal quantifiers:
(2279) Zenbait[musikarik]eta[idazlek]gauezsomemusician.ERGandwriter.ERGnight.byegitendutelan.do.iMPFAUXwork'Some musicians and writers work by night.'
Or even with the first part of some compound words (2281), whose behavior is sometimes parallel to that of prenominal modifiers (2280):

'That pot was full of human arms and thighs.'
This line of argumentation would involve that the prenominal modifier in
(2278), the quantifier in (2279) and even the first part of a compound word
in (2281) are outside of the constituents formed by the noun, the article and
the case ending. Examples like (2220), which Gastanaga regards as backwards gapping, must also be analyzed in the light of the same general situation:
(2282)[Miren zinemara] eta [Pello antzerkira] joan dira.
Miren cinema.to and Pello theatre.to
go
AUX
'Miren has gone to the cinema and Pello to the theatre.'","[917, 918]"
"Postpositions 183Genitive. The genitive forms given in the tables above are noun modifiers
and cannot appear by themselves; e.g: lagunaren liburua 'the friend's
book'; but they can be modifiers of headless noun phrases and take further
inflection; e.g.: lagunarena 'the one of the friend', lagunarenak 'the ones of
the friend', lagunarenari 'to the one of the friend'. In the standard language
described here, the genitive suffixes are indefinite -(r)en, singular -aren,
plural -en. Notice that with consonant-final stems the distinction between
indefinite and plural is neutralized: lau katuren buztanak 'the tails of four
cats' vs. lau katuen buztanak 'the tails of the four cats', but lau gizonen buruak 'the heads of (the) four men'. In some western varieties singular and
plural forms are only distinguished accentually; e.g.: Gernika gixonan etzie
'the house of the man' vs. gixonan etzie 'the house of the men'; in some
Gipuzkoan varieties we find gizonan etxia 'the house of the man' vs. gizonan etxia 'the house of the men'. (In dialects with an accentual contrast, indefinite and plural forms are not neutralized since the indefinite is accentually unmarked: Gernika lau gixonen buruek 'the heads of four men' vs.
lau gixonen buruek 'the heads of the four men'.) There are also dialects
where there is no singular/plural distinction in the genitive.
As in other languages, the genitive, besides its central meaning of indicating the possessor (gizonaren etxea 'the house of the man'), can also indicate authorship (Picassoren ""Guernica"" 'Picasso's ""Guernica""') and other
kinds of relations not involving possession (Jonen irudia 'Jon's picture').
However, genitive relations involving location take -ko and not the genitive,
see 3.1.4.1-3.1.4.2: mendiko etxea 'the house of/on the mountain', etxeko
andrea 'the lady of the house'.
In eastern dialects the direct object takes the genitive case in certain
nominalized embedded clauses (see section 4.10.1.2.2.2.1).
Benefactive. The benefactive is based on the genitive plus the suffix -tzat.
When followed by the relational suffix -ko, the whole ending becomes
-tzako; e.g.: gure lagunarentzako liburua 'the book for our friend'; gure lagunarentzakoak 'the ones for our friend'. In some varieties -tzako or
-dako (Z -tako) is used as the basic benefactive ending; e.g.: liburua lagunendako da 'the book is for the friend':
(166) Ogi-agiinin gii-kwheat-DET hadkabal-entako.we-ERG animals-PL.BEN'Wheat, we had for the animals.'
[Zuberoan, from recorded conversation]184MorphologyComitative. Like the benefactive, the comitative or sociative is also based on
the genitive, but with deletion of the nasal before the ending -kin. Eastern
dialects have variants -ki and -kila\ e.g.: R aingurieki 'with the angels', arresikila 'with the sheep'. In Bizkaian, -gaz is used instead, added to absolutive forms, e.g.: mutildgaz 'with the boy', lau lagunegaz 'with four friends'.
In the plural, -ak + -gaz > -kaz\ e.g.: Β mutttakaz 'with the boys', lau
lagünekaz 'with the four friends'. In western dialects, the instrumental has
been lost in productive usage and the comititive is used in its place to express instrument or means.
Instrumental. The instrumental case carries the endings indefinite -z, singular -az and plural -ez. In some dialects the plural is -etaz, instead. In High
Navarrese, the final consonant in the instrumental is -s: HN eskuas 'with the
hand' (standard eskuaz). The instrumental indicates instrument or means:
giltzaz ireki dugu atea 'we have opened the door with the key', trenez etorri
gara 'we have come by train', oinez 'by foot'; matter: zilarrez egin dugu
'we have made it with silver', zilarrezko eleztuna 'a silver ring'; and topic:
morfologiaz hitzegin genuen 'we spoke about morphology'. It is also used in
some simple time expressions: goizez 'early in the morning', garaiz 'on
time', egunaz zerbait alegratzen naiz, gabaz beti penetan 'during the day I
become somewhat happy, at night, always in pain' (folk song) and with
names of languages: euskaraz (egin) '(to speak) in Basque', ingelesez 'in
English'. In both of these usages, the instrumental is usually replaced by the
locative in more complex expressions: gaur goizean 'today in the morning',
hizkuntza honetan (egin) '(to speak) in this language'.
As mentioned above, in Bizkaian and Gipuzkoan areas, the comitative is
used instead of the instrumental in its central meanings: giltzarekin ireki
dugu atea 'we have opened the door with the key', eskuekin egin dugu 'we
have made it with our hands', although residual use of the instrumental is
maintained in these dialects in other instances.
Some verbs take complements in the instrumental: ahaztu naiz liburuaz
Ί have forgotten the book' (see section 4.1.7.1).
The instrumental is also used in some idiomatic expressions: buruz ikasi
'to learn by heart (lit. by head)', etxez etxe 'from house to house' (see 3.8.6,
3.8.8). Some postpositions also require a complement in the instrumental:
mugaz bestalde 'on the other side of the border', horretaz gain 'in addition
to that', horretaz aparte 'aside from that' (see 3.3).
Prolative. The prolative suffix is -tzat, added directly to the stem. Prolative
phrases only occur as complements of a few verbs such as hartu 'to take',Postpositions185eduki 'to have', and eman 'to give': italianotzat hartu ninduten 'they took
me for an Italian' (cf. Sp me tomaron por italiano), ontzat eman zuten 'they
considered it good' (cf. Sp lo dieron por bueno), laguntzat dauzkate 'they
consider them friends' (cf. Sp los tienen por amigos).
Partitive. From the point of view of its syntactic distribution, the partitive is
a subtype of absolutive inflection. Partitive-marked noun phrases occur as
direct object and intransitive subject in polarity contexts such as negative,
interrogative or conditional sentences: ez dut zakurrik ikusi Ί haven't seen
any dogs', zakurrik ikusi duzu? 'have you seen any dogs?' zakurrik ikusten
baduzu, esan 'if you see any dogs, say so'. Other uses of the partitive are
described in section 3.1.2.4.
Local cases. The local cases form a morphological subparadigm characterized by the presence of -eta- in the plural {-ota- in the proximal plural) and
-ta- in indefinite forms, whereas in singular forms the local endings -an 'in,
on, at', -ra 'to' and -tik 'from' attach directly to the stem.
The locative -an expresses 'place where' in general: gure etxean 'in our
house', mahaian 'on, in the table', lanean 'at work', mendi horietan 'in, on
those mountains'. What appears to be an older indefinite form of the locative suffix, -n, is found in some expressions. Thus, in Zuberoan etxen 'at
home' is distinguished from etxean 'in the house'. Very likely, the imperfective participle suffix -t(z)en is in its origin a locative-inflected form of the
nominalization in -t(z)e (see section 3.5.1.2.1).
The ablative has two main basic meanings 'place from' and 'place
through': menditik dator 's/he is coming from the mountain', leihotik sartu
gara 'we have entered through the window'. As ablative suffix, besides -tik
we find -ti in many areas. The ablative plural has a variant -etarik in eastern
dialects. In Bizkaian dialects that have preserved accentual contrasts in inflected forms, the ablative is accentually marked, which often indicates a
more recent incorporation as an inflectional suffix (see section 1.2.2.). For
possible historical connections with the derivational suffix -ti (as in, e.g.,
gezurti 'liar') and with the partitive -(r)ik, see Lafon (1948). A variant -rik is
general in certain frozen expression such as etxerik etxe 'from house to
house' and has a wider use in certain dialects. Old Bizkaian had a different
ablative in -rean\ e.g.: zerurean 'from the sky', esku onerean 'from a good
hand'.
In the allative, 'place to', besides -ra we find -rat (-lat, -alat) in eastern
dialects. In some of these dialects these two forms convey different semantic
nuances, but other speakers use them indistinctively (see Lafitte 1944:60).","[212, 213, 214, 215]"
"3.1.3. Adjectives
3.1.3.1. Lexical adjectives
Basque has a large and open class of adjectives, and adjectives are rather
sharply distinguished from other parts of speech: as a rule, a word which is
an adjective cannot also be another part of speech. There are just a handful
of mostly ancient exceptions which can serve as either adjectives or nouns,
like Hun 'dark' and 'darkness', hotz 'cold' (ADJ.) and 'cold' (n.) (opposite of
'heat'), bero 'hot' and 'heat', and gose 'hungry' and 'hunger', plus a couple
of adjectives which can also serve as verbs, like hil 'dead' and both 'die'
and 'kill', and busti 'moist' and 'moisten'. (Such cases must not be con-The noun phrase137fused with headless NPs containing adjectives; see section 3.1.5.) Lexical
adjectives may be morphologically simple (handi 'big', gorri 'red'), they
may be derived from other words by means of the numerous adjectiveforming suffixes (euritsu 'rainy', from euri 'rain', diruzale 'avaricious',
from diru 'money'), or they may be compounds (larrugorri 'naked', from
larru 'skin' plus gorri 'red', ahobero 'indiscreet', from aho 'mouth' plus
bero 'hot').
Virtually all lexical adjectives follow their head noun within an NP, but a
small number of adjectives may or must precede the head noun; see section
3.1.3.2 below. Some adjectives may also occur as appositions following the
noun phrase, see
There is no formal difference between restrictive and non-restrictive adjectives: liburu zaharra 'the old book' can be understood either restrictively
(""as opposed to the new one"") or non-restrictively (""the only book under
discussion, which happens to be old"").
There are two lexical adjectives derived from relative forms of finite
verbs: den (B G dan) 'all', from da 'is', and zen (B G zari) 'late' (i.e., 'deceased'), from zen ~ zan 'was', as in gizon denak 'all the men' and Koldo
Mitxelena zena 'the late Luis Michelena'. (In the north, dena, plural denak,
is strictly pronominal, and cannot be used as an adjective.)
A number of adjectives, mostly borrowed from Spanish, exceptionally
exhibit sex-marking. An example is majo 'nice', which has a female variant
maja applied to women and girls; the unmarked variant majo is used in all
other circumstances (males, animals, inanimates, abstractions). Other examples include the loans tontoltonta 'foolish' and katoliko/katolika 'Catholic'.
Such sex-marking is confined to western varieties, and Β in particular may
have hundreds of these; eastern varieties invariably borrow only the masculine form of a Romance adjective and apply it indiscriminately to both sexes
in Basque.
Multiple adjectives are possible. The order is usually exactly the reverse
of English, or exactly the same in terms of distance from the head noun, as
in:
(100) etxe zuri txiki polit bat
house white little pretty a
'a pretty little white house'
But other orders can occur, as in the popular song138Morphology(101) txakur txikigorritxodog
small red.DlM
'a little red dog'bat
aTransitive adjectives exist, governing complement phrases in various
cases but most often in the instrumental:
(102) Bere lan-az
hisharroadago.work.LNST proud.DET is'She is proud of her work.'
However, such transitive adjective phrases are confined to predicate position, and may not occur inside a noun phrase:
(103) *emakume
woman[bere lanaz
herharro] awork.LNST proud DET'a woman proud of her work'
The only way of translating the English phrase here is by means of a relative
clause:
(104) [bere lanazdagoen]emakumeaher
work.lNST proud.DET is.COMP
'a woman who is proud of her work'harroawoman.DET3.1.3.2. Preposed adjectives
While the vast majority of lexical adjectives follow their heads, a very few
precede. There are several classes of these.
First, ordinal numerals usually precede their heads; see section 3.1.2.5.2.
Second, the unique item bertze ~ beste 'other' always precedes, as in
Bestepertsona bat 'another person' and beste bi liburu 'another two books'.
Third, adjectives of nationality commonly precede their head, though not
invariably so. Nationality modifiers formed with -ko are, of course, -ko
phrases, and they occupy the position of a complex modifier, as in Bizkaiko
Golkoa 'the Bay of Biscay' and Estatu Batuetako ikasleak 'students from
the USA'. Nationality adjectives formed with the ethnonymic suffix -(t)ar
may either precede or follow: espainiar idazleak or idazle espainiarrak
'Spanish writers'. Nationality adjectives which are lexically simple (inThe noun phrase139Basque) usually precede but may occasionally follow; most of these are
loans and many can also be used as nouns: Frantses Bidea 'the French
Road' (i.e., 'the Milky Way'), nafar hizkuntza 'the Navarrese language'
(i.e., Basque), ingeles hitza 'an English word', polizia espainola 'the Spanish police'. Note, though, that, for some (not all) speakers, ingeles liburua
can only mean 'an English book' (a book for teaching English), whereas liburu ingelesa can mean either this or 'an English book' (a book written in
English). The first pattern is perhaps to be regarded as a compound noun
rather than as an instance of adjective-noun.
The nationality term euskal 'Basque' (L LN eskual) is unique, in that it is
explicitly a combining form and hence must precede its head: Euskal Herria
'the Basque Country', euskal idazleak 'Basque writers'. Eastern varieties
(only) permit the long form eskuara to follow its head: liburu eskuara bat 'a
Basque book'. This is not possible in other varieties. The combining form
euskal has a non-historical variant eusko, coined in the late 19th century by
Sabino Arana (who spelled it euzko); this variant is official in certain contexts, as in Eusko Jaurlaritza 'the Basque (Autonomous) Government'. It is
now often preferred to denote 'Basque' (as an ethnic or geographical label),
while euskal is confined to 'Basque-speaking', 'in the Basque language'.
Fourth, adjectives of religion may either precede or follow: girixtino sinestea or sineste girixtinoa 'Christian belief.
Fifth, adjectives formed with the derivational suffix -dun 'having' may
either precede or follow. This suffix is a reduced form of duen 'who has', a
relative form of a finite verb, and the preposed position is therefore to be
expected, but in practice we find both euskaldun umeak and ume euskaldunak for 'Basque-speaking children' (see section 3.7.2.1).
Sixth, the two words eskuin 'right' and ezker 'left' can be found both
preposed and postposed: esku ezkerra 'the left hand', eskuin belarria 'the
right ear'. The same is true of gaiso ~ gaixo 'poor' (expressing sympathy):
gaixo gizona or gizon gaixoa 'the poor man' (western varieties permit only
the second).
Seventh, the adjective gazte 'young', which is normally always postposed, is preposed in the fixed expression gazte jendea 'the young people',
'the younger generation'.
Finally, adjectives derived from participles of verbs may, in northern varieties, occur in either position: ongi ikasi haurrak or haur ongi ikasiak
'well-educated children'. See section 3.1.3.5 for more information.
A preposed adjective must usually follow any preposed quantifier: lau
ingeles untziak 'the four English ships', hanitz espainiar idazle 'many Span-140 Morphologyish writers'. But, as shown above, bertze ~ beste 'other' is an exception, as
are -ko phrases: Estatu Batuetako lau ikasle 'four students from the US'.","[166, 167, 168, 169, 170]"
"4.10.2.2.2.3. Other adverbial structures based on the participle
The participle is also used with other independent words to form adjunct
clauses; these postpositions may take noun phrases as their complement
(e.g. ezik 'except for (not)', ezean 'except for (not)', gäbe 'without', ondorenlondoanlosteon 'after', bitartean 'in the meantime', arte 'until'), and,
in some cases, also take -en headed finite clauses, as we saw in section
4.10.2.1.2.4. Even though the same structure that exists for the participle
also exists for regular noun phrases, it is harder to argue that the perfect participle is indeed part of a nominalized structure; the article, for example, is
missing and, in the cases where a regular noun phrase requires genitive
case, the participle lacks it. Below we provide some relevant examples.
The words ezik and ezean, both based on ez 'not' form negative conditionals:
(1799) a.",[777]
"Many of these examples are ambiguous. For example, in (2206) it may be
the case that we are calling two people, one that is in charge of the economy, and the other being in charge of finances; but it could also be the case
that we refer to people that are at the same time in charge of the economy
and finances.
Thus, the possibility of coordination is wider in word compounding than
in the case of derivation; but this possibility is not unconstrained. We will
try to analyze the conditions that favor this kind of construction or make it
more difficult.
This type of coordination is not allowed in co-compounds:
(2208)arrozetakafesneariceandcoffee.milk.DET'rice and coffee with milk'/*'rice with milk and coffee with milk'
The same happens when morphophonological changes have taken place
(arto to the derivational form arta-):
(2209)*arbi
turnipeta
arta.soro
and corn.fieldA high degree of lexicalization makes it difficult to coordinate two elements
under one only 'head':
(2210)lardietabehi-esneasheepandcow-milk.DETCoordination871The lack of parallelism in the relations of each conjunct with the head prohibits their coordination:
(2211)*mando eta mendi.bide
mule
and mountain.trail
'mule- and mountain trails'Mandobide would be a mule trail, and mendibide a mountain trail. The two
modifier nouns cannot be coordinated with the head noun.
On the other hand, coordination is easier with synthetic compounds:
(2212)barazki
eta gozoki saltzaileak
vegetables and candy seller.DET.PL
'vegetable and candy sellers'Coordination is also possible when the head is semantically 'open' and imposes very few requirements on its complement, allowing for a large variety
of them:
(2213)uso
eta antzar sailak
dove and goose group.DET.PL
'flocks of doves and geese'In this line, compounds with a very low degree of lexicalization and a high
regularity and productivity are accepted and used without any problem:
(2214)ekonomia eta hizkuntza arazoak
economy and language problem.DET.PL
'language and economy problems'A last case that could be taken into account is the possibility of coordinating
parts of complex words with prenominal modifiers. These constructions are
totally ruled out in Basque:
(2215)*azukrearen
eta gatz-ontzia
sugar.DET.GEN and salt-pot.DET(2216)*ekonomiaren
economy.det.GENeta
andhizkuntza-arazoak
language-problem.DET.PL872 Syntax4.11.4. Sentence coordination and ellipsis
In the same way as smaller elements, whole sentences may also be conjuncts in coordinated structures. If the two clauses have some like material,
the repeated elements are often omitted. When this happens, it is not always
clear to which category the coordinated constituents belong. In this section
we will try to analyze mainly two structures where the constituents involved
seem to be sentences: gapping structures, and examples with ellipsis of the
auxiliary verb.","[900, 901, 902]"
"3.1.11. Non-constituent word-forms
Since certain determiners and all case-markers are suffixes, attached to the
end of a complete noun phrase and phonologically bound to what is otherwise the final element, it often happens that a noun phrase ends in something which is a single phonological word and apparently a single grammatical word-form but which is not a syntactic constituent. For example, the
sequence ume txiki 'little child' can take the plural definite article to produce
ume txikiak '(the) little children', in which the single form txikiak is not a
constituent: the syntactic structure is [ume txiki\ak. The same thing can happen when a case-suffix is added: the noun phrase zenbait gizon 'several
men' can take the ergative case-suffix to produce zenbait gizonek, but again
gizonek is not a constituent here: the syntactic structure is [zenbait gizon]ek.
The Basque grammarians of the past, trained only in the Latinate word-andparadigm model of description, frequently misunderstood this point badly,
and their grammars often present full paradigms for what are erroneously
called ""undefined"" or ""indefinite"" (mugagabe) forms: gizon 'man' (""absolutive indefinite""), gizonek (""ergative indefinite""), and so on. These forms
do not really exist: a case-suffix cannot, in general, be added to a bare noun,
but only to a full NP with a determiner.",[200]
"3.1.2.7. Indefinite and interrogative determiners
Basque has a number of indefinite and interrogative determiners. All of
these are formally derived from indefinite and interrogative pronouns, and
their formation is accordingly described in sections 3.1.6.1.3 and 3.1.6.1.4,
but their syntax is described here.
All the determiners described here occupy the DETl (preposed) position.
They include zein 'which?' (Northern zoin), zer 'what?', zenbat 'how
much? how many?' (variants zeinbat, zonbat, zomat), zeinnahi 'whichever
you like, any at all', edozein 'any' (free-choice, not polarity), hainbat and
hainbeste 'so many, that much' and the archaic ezein 'any' (polarity item).
Examples may be found in table 46.
The items zein and zer have a special use in exclamations, corresponding
to English 'what' or 'how' in this function (4.6.1.1). Unusually, they frequently, though not invariably, take the definite article in this function; in
central varieties, zer commonly occurs in its reduced prenominal form ze
(see table 47).",[162]
"4.10.3.1.1.3. Gapping of the relativized NP
As can be seen in the examples above, the relativized NP is gapped in ordinary relatives, and neither a relative pronoun, nor any other pronominal
form corresponding directly to the relativized NP appears within the relative
clause.
However, when the relativized NP is one of the NPs carrying verbagreement (absolutive, ergative, dative), the agreement marker acts like a
kind of remote or indirect resumptive morpheme (see Bossong 1984). Compare the following examples:Subordination765(1850) a.merkatuan
erosi dituzun
sagarrak
market.LOC buy AUX.COMP apple.DET.PL
'the apples that you bought in the market.'
b. sagarrak
erosi dituzun
merkatua
apple.DET.PL buy
AUX.COMP market.DET
'the market where you bought the apples'In (1850a) the relativized NP is the direct object of the relative clause. It
triggers verb-agreement, and the inflected auxiliary has a morpheme (-it-)
indicating that the object is plural. Thus, although the relativized NP is not
overt within the relative clause, the plural marker within the verb inflection
shows agreement with it.
On the contrary, in (1850b), the relativized NP is an adverbial NP (locative) and the verb doesn't agree with it. As can be seen, in this case the relative NP has no overt realization within the relative clause, neither direct
(pronoun) nor indirect (agreement).
Observe that the gap within the relative clause stands not only for the relativized NP, but for the whole phrase, including the case-marker. This is
true of all cases. For example in (1850a) the relativized NP corresponds to a
grammatical case (absolutive), and in (1850b) to an adverbial case (locative).","[794, 795]"

ergative or genitive suffix, so that intensive hauxe has ergative honexek and
genitive honexeren. With other case-suffixes, some speakers place the -xe
after the case-suffix, and so the dative of hauxe may be either honexeri or
honixe.
The form horixe is commonly used as a complete utterance expressing
strong agreement with a preceding statement, like English 'Exactly!' or
'That's it!'.","[153, 154]"
"'As much as he praised this book, he criticized the precursors it
had.' [Mitx. EIG IV:74]4.10.4.3. Superlatives
As described in 3.1.3.3, the superlative form of adjectives takes the suffix
-en, whereas the noun phrase representing the group being compared usually bears the partitive case. However, the noun phrase may also be uninfected or, in eastern dialects, take ablative plural or locative inflection: herrietarikJherrietanlherririklherri ederrena 'the most beautiful village'.
(2042) Hau da Euskal Herriko
leku(rik)
this is Basque Country.REL place(PRTT)
ederrena.
beautiful, most, DET
'This is the most beautiful place in the Basque Country.'
While the partitive and bare noun make up a constituent with the adjective,
ablative and locative phrases have a looser connection with it and may be
found separate from the superlative:
(2043)Zuhaitzetanlzuhaitzetatikl*zuhaitzl*zuhaitzik,haudatrees.LOC/trees.ABL/tree/tree.PRTTthisisederrena.
beautiful.most.DET'Among trees/of trees, this is the most beautiful one.'
Whether in attributive or in predicative position, the superlative adjective
takes the definite determiner. Lafitte (1944:144) mentions that in eastern
dialects, a singular determiner (an 'adverbial article') can occur even when
predicated of plural nominale:836Syntax(2044) Arrotzakurrikariditut,bainanetxekoakstrangerspitifulconsiderbuthouse.REL.DET.PLurrikariena.
pitiful.most.DETΊ pity the strangers, but I pity those at home the most.'
The intuition that this usage is adverbial could be supported by the fact that,
as Lafitte mentions, the partitive urrikarienik would also be possible in this
context, as in the clearly adverbial examples described below (see 3.4.3 for
the adverbial usage of the partitive).
The superlative of a quantity is expressed with gehien 'the most' or guttien 'the least'. It usually occurs in the indefinite form, although a determiner may be added. In the following example, fama gehiena, with the singular determiner, is ambiguous between a superlative interpretation and a
different one where gehiena is used as a quantifier ('most of the reputation'), without comparative content. On the other hand, with the countable
plural noun in (2046) the singular determiner is unacceptable and the plural
one is not superlative but a regular quantifier ('most of the books'):
(2045) Bera da fama gehien/gehiena
duena.
he
is fame most/most.DET has.COMP.DET
'It is him that has (the) most reputation.'
(2046) Liburutegi
libraryhorrekdituliburuthat.ERGhasbookgehien! ? ? gehiena/gehienak.
most/most.DET/most.DET.PL'That library has the most books.'
The 'simple' quantifier reading is not found with guttien 'least'. Thus, the
following sentence is unambiguous:
(2047) Modelo honek
funtzionatu du
akats
model
that.ERG work
AUX flaw
'That model has worked with least flaws.'guttienekin.
least.C0MHowever, the same facts can be reproduced in the following examples,
where the superlative phrase is marked dative: the indefinite dative bezero
gehieni is interpreted as superlative 'to the biggest number of clients', while
plural dative berezo gehienei receives a simple quantificational reading 'to
most clients'.","[865, 866]"

"4.10.3. Relatives
B. Oyhar^abal
Different relativization strategies are used in Basque. The main distinction
is the one separating ordinary embedded relatives from appositive and extraposed relatives with relative pronouns. This second kind of relativization
is a marked one, and has often been considered as not genuine by modern
grammarians like Altube, Lafitte and Lafon. Although most Basque writers
in the 20th century haven't used adjoined relatives with relative pronouns,
these were very common in written texts until the second half of the 19th
century in all dialects. Here are examples of both kinds of relatives:
(1846) Hala
sodio
saysohartxoeskuizkribuarijositazetorrenmanuscript.DATattach.PTCPcame.COMPhorrek.note, DIM that. ERG'So says this little note which came attached to the manuscript.'
[Am: 12]
In (1846), the relative clause precedes the modified noun, and it is embedded within the whole phrase. This clause contains no relative pronoun, andSubordination 763no resumptive pronoun, and the relativized noun has no overt realization in
it. Consider now (1847):
(1847) Ikusten
see.LMPFditut(...)bizizpa-kanoirenmuturrak,AUX.twogun.GENendszeinek(...)
ez baininduten guti izitu.
which.ERG not bait.AUX
little frighten
Ί see ...two gun barrels, which scared me more than a little.' [Eliss.
P.A.:67]
In (1847), the relative clause is said to be adjoined, because it is outside of
the noun phrase whose head the relative modifies {muturrak). This relative
contains a relative pronoun carrying a case ending (zeinek, ergative plural).
Besides the two types mentioned above, correlative relatives and adjoined relatives with resumptive pronouns are also employed, mainly in
eastern dialects. These will be presented at the end of the section
(4.10.3.4.3-4).","[792, 793]"
"2.1.3. Syllable structure and phonotactic restrictions
2.1.3.1. Onsets
The only onset groups allowed in Basque are those of the muta-cum-liquida
type (including fl-, fr- and excluding dl-, tl-). Even these groups were not
permitted in older stages of the language and borrowings from Latin and
early Romance show either deletion of the stop or vowel epenthesis between
stop and liquid (see section 2.1.8.2). Words with these sequences in the
modern language are more recent borrowings (pobre 'poor', prakak 'pants',
plater 'plat€,fresko 'cool', triste 'sad', krabelin 'carnation', gris 'gray'), in
addition to a few cases of syncope in the native vocabulary (e.g. andere >
andre 'woman').",[63]

Introduction
J. I. Hualde1.1. The Basque language and its name
The word 'Basque' derives, through French, from the name of the Vascones, a nation or tribe that in Roman times occupied an area of the Iberian
Peninsula including most of present-day Navarre and neighboring parts of
Aragon. Whereas, on the one hand, possibly not all Vascones were Basquespeaking (both non-Indo-European Iberian and Indo-European Celtiberian
appear to have been used in parts of their territory) and, on the other hand,
Pre-Basque and related languages seem to have been also spoken by some
other neighboring nations (at least the Aquitanians in Gaul, see Gorrochategui 1995), in medieval times the name Vascones became identified
with the speakers of the direct ancestor of the language we know as Basque.
The traditional name for the Basque language in Spanish is vascuence, derived from Latin uasconice '(to speak) in the Vasconic way', which is parallel to and was opposed to romance < romanice 'in the Roman way'. In postRenaissance Spain, the name vizcaino, strictly speaking only the westernmost dialect of Basque, became for several centuries a frequent designation
for the Basque language and its speakers.
The Basques call their language euskara (and dialectal variants: euskera,
eskuara, iiskara, auskera, etc.). Euskara is opposed to erdara (or erdera)
'foreign language', used to refer to Spanish on the southern side of the political border and to French on the other side. Both words have an ending
which very likely derives from the word era 'manner', used as a suffix in
many words, such as ibilera 'way of walking' (from ibil-i 'to walk'), etc. In
erdara the first element appears to be erdi 'half. Etymologically erdara
would thus be 'a half way of speaking', 'something that is not fully a language'; a not unusual way to characterize a foreign language. On the other
hand, the original meaning of the root eusk- in euskara is less clear. Among
the proposed etymologies we find the name of the Ausci, a Pyrenean tribe in
Roman times, and the reconstructed verb *enau(t)s-i 'to speak' (Irigoyen
1977, 1990).","[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

man.COMezkontzeko

hope
have
Ί have the hope I'll marry the man (with) whom I live now.'
Sentence (1883) is an example where relativization is blocked because the
relativized NP is a non-subcategorized adverbial NP (see (1874)). The apparently similar example (1884) is not rejected, since in the latter the head
noun bears the same case as the relativized NP. This contrast shows that
there is a general interpretive rule which attributes to the relativized NP the
same case as that of the whole phrase. This is confirmed by the observation
that mistakes resulting from case parallelism are often produced in child
language.",[811]
"3.1.6.1. Personal pronouns
3.1.6.1.1. Ordinary personal pronouns
The ordinary personal pronouns are as follows:
Table 53. Personal pronouns
ni
Τ
hi
'you' (singular intimate)
'we'
gu
zu
'you' (singular unmarked)
zuek
'you' (plural)The noun phrase 151The pronoun zu is listed with the plurals because it was historically a plural
and it still takes plural agreement in the verb; the innovating plural zuek
takes double plural agreement.
The intimate singular hi is of extraordinarily restricted use. Its use is generally obligatory (a) between siblings, and (b) between close friends of the
same sex and roughly the same age, particularly those who have grown up
together. Its use is optional (a) in addressing children (whether one's own or
not), and (b) in teasing, cursing or abusing (people or animals). It is not
normally used (a) in addressing an adult of the opposite sex (except a sibling), not even a spouse, (b) in addressing a significantly older person (including a parent), or a person of superior status, (c) in addressing an animal
(except when abusing it), (d) in addressing God. Basque-speakers do not
normally change from zu to hi for any reason at all, and so one may find a
70-year-old man addressing a 55-year-old neighbor with hi and receiving zu
in return, because long ago a 20-year-old man chose to address his fiveyear-old neighbor with hi.
Some eastern varieties have another second-person pronoun xu, a palatalized form of zu; this is intermediate in intimacy between zu and hi. Some
southern varieties have a very formal second-person pronoun berori, used
only in addressing a person of markedly superior status; this is formed from
ber- 'self, 'same', plus hori, the mesial demonstrative. A few eastern varieties have a formal second-person singular pronoun ori\ this is derived from
the mesial demonstrative hori.
In general, Basque lacks true third-person pronouns, and demonstratives
are used when third-person pronouns are required for thematic purposes.
Western varieties, however, have acquired third-singular bera and thirdplural berat, these consist of ber- 'self' and the article -a (historically the
distal demonstrative), and represent extensions of the intensive third-person
pronouns (see section 3.1.6.1.2). Bizkaian has a curious variant eurak for
berak.
Personal pronouns cannot be modified directly. A second-person pronoun, however, can be modified indirectly by using the mesial demonstrative hori as a pronoun, as in
(114) Hain argia zaren
sohorrekclever are.COMP that.ERGjakinbeharkozenuke.knowmust.FUT AUX'You, who are so clever, ought to know.'
Note that the verb-forms zaren and zenuke show second-person agreement,
as though the head were (ergative) zuk rather than horrek. This same hori is152 Morphologyalso used for vocative 'you' when there is other material present, as in gaiso
hori 'you poor thing' and alu hori! 'you jerk!'. The comparable use of
hau(r) for Τ is less common today, but frequent in older literature, as in
(115) Uste nuen nar honek
tela
hain handia.
think AUX idiot this.ERG was.that so big.DET
'Idiot that I am, I thought it was so big'
For inflectional paradigms, see section 3.2.4.","[180, 181, 182]"
"3.2.5. Personal pronouns
The genitive form of the personal pronouns has the ending -re, instead of
-en (with the exception of the second person plural pronoun zuek, which historically is more recent, and has a genitive zueri). Other than this, personal
pronouns inflect in the same manner as indefinite noun phrases:

Similarly, some clauses hardly ever function as foci and tend to occur to the
right of the clause. This is the case, for instance, of eta, ze, bait causal
clauses (4.10.2.2.1.5) as opposed to -lako clauses (4.10.2.2.1.1.3).
Discourse considerations, however, may override heaviness, so that those
clause types whose discourse function is typically thematic tend to appear as
topics in the left periphery of the clause. This is the case of conditional and
concessive clauses (Zabala 2000):

"3.2.2. Inflectional suffixes for case and number
3.2.2.1. Basic morphological paradigms
As indicated above, although case and number inflection in Basque is
phrasal in scope, it is morphologically expressed by means of bound forms
attached to the last word in the noun phrase.
As the examples above already show, demonstratives are inflected in a
somewhat different way from other words. Personal pronouns also show
minor idiosyncrasies. Other than this, nominal inflection is completely regular and uniform, in the sense that there is no lexical marking of nouns or adjectives as requiring special forms of the inflectional suffixes or as belonging to different inflectional classes. The number/case inflectional endings
are the same for all nouns and adjectives. Regarding the shape of the inflectional endings, a distinction, however, must be made between stems ending
in a vowel and stems ending in a consonant. Also among vowel-final stems,172Morphologythose ending in -a present certain morphophonological peculiarities (in
many dialects there are further morphophonological complications, see 3.2.6
below). We will first describe the morphophonology of case and number inflection in a systematic way, presenting complete inflectional paradigms.
Then, we will examine the morphology and use of each case suffix separately.
Four morphological subparadigms are distinguished. First, indefinite
forms are distinguished from definite forms; definite forms, in their turn,
may be singular or plural; and within the plural, in addition to the general
plural, there is a proximal plural form.
The inflectional paradigm of the word leku 'place' is given in table 59 as
an example of a nominal stem ending in a nonlow vowel. Again, what we
mean by the inflectional paradigm of the word leku is the set of forms that
this word will take when not followed by any other word within the noun
phrase. The labels definite, indefinite, singular and plural as well as the case
labels on the left column must be understood as applying to the noun phrase
ending in the word given as an example. As explained in section 3.1.1.1, indefinite forms cannot appear by themselves, and, in order to constitute a
complete noun phrase, must be accompanied by a numeral, quantifier, indefinite or interrogative determiner (e.g. zazpi leku 'seven places', zenbait
lekutan 'in several places', edozein lekutara 'to any place', zenbat lekurekin? 'with how many places?')
Nouns/adjectives ending in -a lose this vowel when followed by a vowelinitial inflectional suffix. As an example of noun ending in -a, the word
hondartza 'beach, sandy place' is given in table 60.
In Bizkaian and some Gipuzkoan varieties, stem-final /a/ raises to /e/ before the singular article /-a/. The resulting sequence -ea has undergone further changes in different western varieties. Thus, for instance, for alaba
'daughter', we find the following absolutive singular forms: Arratia alabea,
Getxo alabe, Lekeitio alabia, Gernika alabie, Ondarroa alabi. In a couple of
villages on the boundary of the western area where -a-a > -e-a and the area
where -a-a > -a, forms with -aa are found; e.g.: alabaa 'the daughter'. In
the plural, on the other hand, there is no rising of stem-final /a/ in any dialect. In a few conservative western varieties (Onati), we find the historical
long vowel unchanged in the absolutive plural; e.g.: alabaak (vs. singular
alabia in this dialect), elsewhere the sequence has been reduced: Arratia,
Getxo, Lekeitio, etc: alabak (so that, e.g., in Leketio ergative singular alabiek contrasts with absolutive and ergative plural aläbak).
In Zuberoan and the extinct Roncalese dialect, the sequence -a-a has
been reduced, but memory of the historical sequence is accentually pre-Postpositions173served by attraction of the accent; e.g.: Ζ alhäba 'daughter', alhabä 'the
daughter' < *alhaba-a, (vs. gizuna 'the man'), alhabäk 'the daughters' (see
section 2.2.4). In Salazarese, an epenthetic -r- is inserted in the absolutive
singular of stems ending in a low vowel: alabara 'the daughter'.

"AUX.3A.PL/3D/1E.COMPman'Do you know the man who I asked for the books?'
- Relativization of adverbial phrases:

the meadows or in a corner of the mountain.' [Etch. Bur.:83]
In (1871) the relativized phrase corresponds to a local NP (locative case).
The whole phrase gets the absolutive case. Some speakers show reluctance
when this kind of relativization is proposed to them out of context, especially when the head noun is not easily linked to the required interpretation.
However, examples like (1871) are perfect, and regularly produced by
Basque speakers in appropriate discourse situations, even by speakers who
would have hesitated to fully accept them out of context.

[Etch. Bur.: 150]
In (1872) the relativized phrase corresponds to an adverbial phrase (instrumental case) complement of zinkurinaz egon 'complain, moan', and indicating the cause of the laments. The whole phrase exhibits the absolutive case.",[807]
"574 SyntaxUsually, only verbal inflection identifies the grammatical person involved,
and no independent pronominal element is found overtly in the sentence.
Overt pronouns typically receive a definite interpretation (Rodet 1992).
However, zu 'you' and gu 'we' (and even ni Τ in the contexts mentioned
above) may be used as impersonal overt pronouns, especially if emphatic,
while haiek 'they, those', a demonstrative that can normally function as
third person pronoun, cannot receive such interpretation:
(1255) Zukhori bilerabateanesatenduzuyou.ERGthatone.LOCsayAUXetahilegitenandkilldo.lMPF AUXmeetingzaituzte'You (=one) say that at a meeting and they kill you.'

(1257) Hor haiek beti
esaten

there they always say.IMPF AUX want AUX.COMP.DET
'There, they (?one) always say whatever they want.'
The difference between the third person plural and the other pronouns can
also be observed in the case of functions not retrievable from inflection such
as the genitive: while zure 'your' can give rise to impersonal readings, haien
'their' cannot: haien kotxea 'their car' would refer here to a specific car.
(1258) Zurekotxeaarazoakematenhastendenean,yourcarproblemsgivingbeginAUX. whenhöbeda beste baterostea.betterisbuy.NOM.DETotherone'When your (=one's) car begins to give problems, it is better to buy
another one.'
According to Rodet (1992), impersonal plurals are not found with subjects
of unaccusative and psychological predicates: agertzen dira 'they show up',
kezkatzen dira 'they worry' can only be interpreted as personal expressions.","[603, 604]"
"4.2.3. Opinion verbs with predicative complements
We can distinguish three kinds of opinion verbs (see section 4.1.7) taking
into account the case assigned to the subject of the nominal predicate: first,
we have the verbs hartu 'take', jo 'hit', eduki 'have' and eman 'give', all
meaning 'take for, consider' in this case. These assign absolutive case to the
subject of the nominal predicate. Secondly, the verbs iruditu, iduri edun
'seem' and eman in its meaning 'appear' assign ergative case to this subject.
Finally the verb iritzi assigns dative case:
(719) a. Mikel azkartzat
daukat.
Mikel intelligentes have.3A/lE
Ί consider Mikel intelligent.'
b. Mikelek

consider.3A/3D/lENominal predicates with the verbs hartu, jo, eduki and eman always take the
prolative suffix -tzat, which is invariable in number. With the verb eman,
this suffix often appears attached to a participle; nevertheless, it can also
appear with other categories (720b). This verb also differs from the other
three verbs because it expresses an action controlled by the subject.
(720) a. Lana bukatutzat eman dut.
