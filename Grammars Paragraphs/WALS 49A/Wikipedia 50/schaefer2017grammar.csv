"18As well, human nouns that express generic reference such as óìà/éèà ‘human being, person’ fail to
take a li complement: *óíá lì kéré [person R younger] ‘younger human being,’ *ééá lì kéré [persons R

19Additional human propensity adjectives are: ómóhé lì bùmèbúmé [man R haggard.and.worn out]
‘haggard man,’ óvbékhán lì tùzètúzé [youth R underweight.and.dirty] ‘an unkempt youth,’ and
ómóhé lì sènèséné [man R repulsive / very.ugly] ‘an ugly man.’
Not all human propensity adjectives appear as attributive phrases; the form húré ‘pompous’ requires
a relative clause.

Age attributives fail with common noun heads that are human. Instead, analytic compounds
consisting of a human noun followed by an age noun refer to adult (not nonadult) standing in society rather than age relative to the immediate moment.*ómóhé lí ódíòn

condition, meaning of the phrase and tone on the head noun (spread of high tone) are identical:
ímóhé (lì) ògbèré [men R plentiful] ‘a lot of men,’ ékén (lì) ògbèré [sand R plentiful] ‘a lot of sand.’
25Collective and distributive numeral complements follow third person plural pronouns: íyáín lì èvá
[they R two] ‘both of them / group of two,’ and ìyàìn èvá [they two] ‘two of them.’26As a final comment, instances where phrases with collective and attribution interpretations might
be expected to co-occur, each marked by Relator li with a place or human noun in head position, fail
to do so: *íwé lì èvá lì kéré [house R two R small.size] ‘group of two small-sized houses’; *íwé lì kéré lì
èvá [house R small.size R two] ‘group of two small-sized houses’;*ímóhé lì èélè lì kéré [men R four R

‘As for the ones who gave yam to the farmer, they hit a dog with a stone.’
28Pronominally headed relative clauses also occur in Emai. They fail to show Relator li, and they are
headed by a relative pronoun denoting either an animate (ólí), inanimate (émé') or place (ébé')236 | Noun modifiersreferent (Chapter 5, 5.8). Relative pronouns uniformly show high tone or high tone followed by high
downstep.

30As a further note, ambiguity as to phrase head can occur in constructions with genitive phrase
and relative clause. In (i) relative clause head preceding Relator li could be possessum úríáí or possessor óvbéé; either could serve as direct object of shen ‘sell’ and thus as head of the relative clause.

Emai pronouns express relations relative to linguistic or situational context. They
reflect five basic types: personal, bound (anaphoric), interrogative, locative and
impersonal. Exponents of these types can reflect case, person, number, gender,
and/or definiteness. In characterizing Emai grammatical structure, both overt pronoun and zero (gapped) pronoun prove useful.
Zero pronoun is illustrated by the syntactic position following the transitive
verb nwu ‘take.’ This verb is subcategorized for a direct object. nwu takes a pronoun
(e.g. óì ‘it’) in the absence of a lexical noun. In series with another verb (e.g. hian
‘cut’), as well as in other structural patterns, nwu also takes a zero pronoun.
(1) a. ólí ókpósó ló
nwú óì ní émè.
the woman PRED take it APP me
‘The woman will give it to me.’
b. ólí ókpósó ló
hìàn éànmì nwú ní émè.
the woman PRED cut meat take APP me
‘The woman will cut meat in order to give it to me.’5.1 Definite personal pronouns
Definite personal pronouns reflect person (first, second or third), number (singular
and plural), case (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) and discourse status
(emphatic).

ìyáínA single sentence reveals the position of various pronouns. Tone on subject
pronouns varies according to aspect, mood, or polarity features of the clause (Chapter 3, 3.1.1). Tone can also vary on other pronouns as grammatical features interact
throughout a clause.
(2) ìyàìn lí yán nwú'
óì ní émé vbí íwé
ísì èé.
they PF they PAP.take it APP me LOC house ASS your
‘It was they who gave it to me in your house.’
Restrained by case, number and person, personal pronouns refer to participants in
the situational or linguistic context. Third person subject forms (ó ‘she’) can co-refer
to a noun phrase in a preceding sentence.
(3) ólì òkpòsò míé
òhí. ó ó
vbì ìwè.
the woman PRP.see Ohi she PAP.enter LOC house
‘The woman1 saw Ohi. She1 entered the house.’
In complex sentences containing two or more clauses, nominative pronouns (ó)
express co-reference to a lexical antecedent (áléké) in a preceding clause. They tend
not to co-refer to a noun phrase in a following clause. This condition obtains regardless of whether the pronoun occurs in the main or subordinate clause of a complex
sentence.
(4) a. bí áléké ré'

míé òhí.
she PAP.enter LOC house as Aleke PAP.CONC see Ohi
‘Shei entered the house, when Alekei saw Ohi.’
For third person plural subject, e and yan exponents occur in complementary
distribution. Plural e tends not to co-refer to a noun phrase across a sentence
boundary; instead, it co-refers within a clause. In contrast, plural yan co-refers to a
noun phrase within or across sentences.
(5) a. élí ívbèkhàn yé
ògò. yán gbé'
ófè.

PRP.move.to bush they PAP.kill rat
‘The youths went to the bush. They killed rats.’
b. *élí ívbèkhàn yé
ògò. é
gbé'
ófè.
the youths
PRP.move.to bush they PAP.kill rat
‘The youths went to the bush. They killed rats.’
In addition, distribution of third person plural subject forms yan and e is controlled
by matrix clause aspect and structural position. Plural e is restricted to perfect aspect. It never occurs in clauses inflected for imperfect, as yan does. Plural third person e is limited to subject position relative to an antecedent in the same clause or
sentence; yan is not. When a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus,
antitopic (right dislocated), question or relative clause position and the matrix
clause inflects for perfect aspect, e or yan appears as subject.

‘The ones who are in the river are lost.’240 | Pronouns and conjunctionWhen a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus, antitopic (right dislocated), question or relative clause position and the matrix clause is inflected for
imperfect aspect, yan occupies subject position. e never does, as topic and focus
li/ni constructions suggest.

they H kill rat
‘As for youths, they kill rats.’
b. ívbèkhàn lí yán à / *é è gbè ófè.
youths
PF they H
they H kill rat
‘It is youths who kill rats.’
When the third person plural emphatic pronoun appears in focus or topic position
linked to a matrix clause inflected for perfect aspect, subject position accepts only
yan, not e.
(8) a. ìyàìn lí yán / *é

‘It was they who killed the rat.’
b. ìyàìn, yán / *é

ólí ófè.
they they they PAP.kill the rat
‘As for them, they killed the rat.’
Within S-complements (marked by Indicative khi for example, Chapter 13, 13.2.1),
subject position under perfect aspect accepts yan or e, with yan showing ambiguity
between personal (disjoint reference vis-à-vis subject élí ímóhé) and logophoric
(conjoint reference vis-à-vis élí ímóhé) interpretations. In contrast, e offers only a
disjoint interpretation.

Of the personal pronouns, only emphatic forms appear with postdeterminer
modifiers. Emphatic pronouns for each person occur with emphatic partitive òkpá
‘alone.’ No emphatic pronoun, however, co-occurs with the definite predeterminer
(*élì ìyàìn ‘the they’).

‘I / you / he, she, it / we / you / they alone’Definite personal pronouns | 241Emphatic pronouns for third person singular and plural as well as first and second
person plural allow postdeterminers from quantity, demonstrative and attributive
classes. The third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts the greatest range of
modifiers. It is found with cardinal or collective numeral modifiers but not distributive or ordinal numeral modifiers.

contrastive évbèé).

*íyáín ésò ‘some of them’

but not distal áìn or contrastive nóì.
íyáín nà ‘this very they’
they this
*íyáín áìn ‘that very they
they that*íyáín nóì ‘the next very they’

élìyó (*íyáín élìyó [they that.kind] ‘they of that kind’) nor contrastive édàn (*íyáín
édàn [they different.kind] ‘they of a different kind’).
Relative to postnominal modifier types designated by a grammatical morpheme,
the third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts Relator li attributive phrases but
not relative clauses (*íyáín lí ójé shén' lí ókpósó [they R Oje PAP.sell APP woman]
‘they that Oje sold to the woman’) or Associative ísì phrases (*íyáín ísì òjè [they ASS
Oje]‘those of Oje’).
íyáín lí óbín' ‘they that dark’

Emai subject position shows both an expletive and an indefinite pronoun. Expletive
o occurs in relation to an extraposed complement clause. Although an embedded Scomplement can serve as logical subject, it is obligatorily extraposed to clause final
position. Its grammatical subject position is held by expletive pronoun o.
(10) a. ò hùnmé
khì òjè gbé
ólí ényè.
it PRP.be.fortuitous IND Oje PRP.kill the snake
‘It is fortuitous that Oje killed the snake.’
b. *khì òjè gbé
ólí ényè húnmé.
IND Oje PRP.kill the snake PRP.be.fortuitous
‘That Oje killed the snake is fortuitous.’
Subject position also shows indefinite pronoun a ‘one.’ If not translated by the
English passive, it is rendered with indefinite plural ‘they’ or ‘one’ in active voice.
(11) á
gbé'
ólí ófè.
one PAP.kill the rat
‘One / They killed the rat / The rat was killed.’
Indefinite a never occupies nonsubject grammatical positions such as direct or indirect object, or discourse-defined positions like focus or topic.1Expletive and indefinite pronouns | 243(12) a. *ólí ívbèkhàn gbé

the youth

Oje PRP.take yam APP one
‘Oje gave yam to one.’
c. *à lí ó gbé'
ólí ófè.
one PF he PAP.kill the rat
‘It was one that killed the rat.’
Indefinite a is limited to subject positions subcategorized for human noun agentives
or experiencers, as grammatical gbe above illustrates. It is not licensed by stative
verbs (ri, da) or motion verbs (o, ye), which otherwise allow a human noun subject.
(13) a. *à ríì

c. *à ó
vbì ìwè.
one PRP.enter LOC house
‘One entered the house.’
d. *à yé
ìwè.
one PRP.move.to house
‘One moved toward the house.’
Indefinite subject a occurs with transitive verbs requiring experiencer subjects.
However, it does so only in negative constructions.

Indefinite a never co-refers across sentences, across clause boundaries within a
complex sentence or across clauses embedded within one another.","[260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269]"
"7.6.2 Negation ki
Sentence negation (SN) constructions are framed by clause initial ki. They negate an
entire proposition, specifying that it is not shared by speaker and hearer as true. The
construction takes the form of a polar interrogative or a declarative with an obligatory contrary-to-expectation interjection ò. Consequently, ki either queries the proposition expressed in the interrogative with an assumption of doubt or contravenes
the interjection framed declarative structure.
(146) a. kí ólí ókpósó één'-ì?
SN the woman PAP.know-F
‘Isn't it the case that the woman knew?’
b. kí ólí ókpósó één'-ì

‘It surely isn't the case that the woman knew.’

‘Isn't it the case that the man slept?’
d. kí ólí ómóhé méhén'-ì
ò.
SN the man PAP.sleep-F INT
‘It isn't the case the man slept, even though you expect he did.’
A response to interrogative ki constructions is hèè ‘yes’ followed by an affirmative
declarative, or òghò ‘no’ followed by a negative statement.
(147) kí ólí ómóhé gbé'

he NEG kill it
‘No, he did not kill it.’ki constructions constrain their matrix clause subject, inflection and occurrence
of auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding preverbs, SN imposes severe restrictions. It
rejects all preverbs: aspectualizer, evaluative, temporal, subject attributive, quantity
and manner-demonstrative. SN ki constructions partially limit aspect. They inflect
for Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective. Thus they disallow
Present perfect, Continuous imperfect and Anticipative prospective.
(148) a. kí ólí óvbékhán fí'

c. kí ólí ómóhé ló

SN the man

‘It surely isn't the case that the man will sleep.’
In ki matrix clauses modality auxiliaries are restricted absolutely. One finds neither deontic (Hortative í) nor epistemic (Certaintive ma, Dubitative vba and bia,
Deductive za, Resultative za, Concessive rere, Hypothetical kha). Hypothetical kha
illustrates (*kí ólí ómóhé khà gbé ófè? [SN the man PAP.HYP kill rat] ‘Isn’t it the case
that the man would have killed a rat?’).
SN ki clauses completely reject relative tense ke and kpe, as ke shows (*kí ólí
ómóhé ké' gbé ófè? [SN the man PAP.ANT kill rat] ‘Isn’t it the case that the man
killed a rat afterwards?’).
SN ki clauses constrain subject shape. They allow proper nouns (òlóló) and definite common nouns: human (ómóhé), animate (ófé) and inanimate (íkpún).32

SN the cloths
cloths PAP.burn CS INT
‘It surely isn't the case that the cloth pieces burned up.’
ki construction subject phrases restrict some postdeterminers. SN animate subjects modified by the definite article combine with deictic demonstratives ná and áín
(kí ólí ómóhé ná / áín gbé' ófè ò [SN the man this that PAP.kill rat INT] ‘It surely isn't
the case that this / that man killed a rat’). Also acceptable is contrastive demonstrative nóí (kí ómóhé nóí gbé' ófè ò [SN man next PAP.kill rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the
case that the next man killed a rat’).
In SN subject position kindred forms are partially restricted. Deictic élìyó is
grammatical but contrastive sortal ódàn is not (kí úkpún élìyó / *ódàn ó ò ghàén ò
[SN cloth that.kind different.kind SC H costly INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that
kind of cloth is costly’).
SN subjects admit only one quantifier, collective universal èrèmé. It occurs, although not with the definite article (kí (*élí) éwé èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goats all
PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that all the goats entered the
house’). No other quantifier (distributive universal òdóòdé, partitive existential ósò
or contrastive existential óvbèé) occupies SN subject position as modifier.
Subject phrases in ki matrix clauses allow most numeral modifiers. One finds
collective ìgbìgbé ‘all ten’ (kí íkpún ìgbìgbé tóó' á vbí ólì èràìn ò? [SN cloths all.ten
PAP.burn CS LOC the fire INT] ‘Isn't it surely the case that all ten cloths burned up in
the fire?’) and cardinal èvá ‘two,’ although cardinals require the definite article (kí
élí éfè èvá ó' vbì òò ò? [SN the rat two PAP.enter LOC hole INT] ‘Isn't it surely the case
that two rats entered the hole?’). SN subjects disallow cardinal òkpá ‘one,’ regardless of constituent definiteness (*kí ómòhè òkpá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN man one PAP.enter
LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that one man entered the house’), and emphatic òkpá ‘alone’ (*kí ólí ómòhè òkpá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the man alone PAP.enter LOC
house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the man alone entered the house’).
ki subjects accept postnominal modifier phrases. Among the latter are expressions with Associative ísì (kí (ólí) éwé ísì ólí ókpósó ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goat ASS the
woman PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the woman's goat
entered the house’), Relator li (kí (ólí) éwé lí óbín' ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goat R dark
PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the dark goat entered the
house’) and relative clause (kí (ólí) ómóhé lí ó dá' ólí ényó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man
R he PAP.drink the wine PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It isn't the case that the man who
drank the wine killed the rat, although you may have thought so’). In elicited constructions, there is a preference for definite article inclusion.
Subject position in ki constructions imposes greater restrictions on impersonal
pronouns than personal pronouns. It allows subject pronouns for each person and
number.","[434, 435, 436]"
"Cultural and Linguistic Background
Emai is mother tongue for approximately 25,000–35,000 members of the Emai clan
in south central Nigeria. It is spoken in ten villages across roughly 250 square kilometers on the plateau between the Edion and Owan rivers of present-day Edo State.
Located at longitude 6° east of Greenwich Meridian and latitude 7° north of the
equator, this area consists primarily of tree savanna, allowing for bush agriculture
involving the harvesting of yam, maize, cassava, and beans among other crops
(Bradbury 1957). Serving as the principal political village of the Emai is Afuze. Other
villages in the clan are Eteye, Evbiame-New-Site, Evbiame-Old-Site, Ogute, OjavunNew-Site, Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhunmi, Ovbionwu, and Uanhumi.
The Emai-speaking region is approximately 120 kilometers north of Benin City
by road. It is connected in the south to Sabongida, the principal village of the related Ora clan, in the east to Uzebba, the primary village of the related Iuleha clan, and
in the north to Auchi, the headquarters of the Edoid language Yekhee.
As for the Emai people, oral tradition makes clear the absence of hereditary
chieftancy, a cultural feature frequent among Edoid peoples of its region. According
to oral tradition (Ogbomo 1994), the ancestor of the Emai people is Ima. He is said to
have fled from the ancient kingdom of Benin in about the 16th Century for committing murder. Ima and his wife, who also came from Benin, had a son Uzuanbi (Oyaibi). Uzuanbi, in turn, had two wives, Odidi and Oron, whose sons founded the Emai
speaking villages. Oral tradition varies at this point. According to one version, the
four sons of Uzuanbi and his wives were Uwuno, Urule, Ivbiame, and Uanhumi,
each of whom founded a village. Their sons, Uzuanbi's grandsons, founded the ten
quarters into which the four villages became divided. According to another version,
the village of Uanhumi is named after the son of one wife and the remaining villages
are related to three sons of a second wife. The sons were Uule, Evbiame and
Ovbionwu, whose names are retained, respectively, by the village sites of Ugbuule,
Evbiame-Old-Site, and Ovbionwu, all of which are located off the main Ora-Auchi
road and tend to be northernmost in their respective village groups. Each of these
villages serves to link the remaining Emai-speaking area. Villages in the Uule group,
from south to north, are: Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhumi, Eteye, Uanhumi, Afuze,
Ojavun-New-Site. Ugbuule no longer exists as an occupied village. The Evbiame
group from south to north consists of Evbiame-New-Site, Ogute, and Evbiame-OldSite. The Ovbionwu group consists solely of Ovbionwu.
As a linguistic entity, Emai is completely surrounded by Edoid speech varieties.
Its genetic classification as a distinct linguistic unit within Edoid is of recent origin.
Elugbe (1973) classified it as part of a dialect cluster incorporating adjacent OraPreface | ix(30,000 speakers) and Iuleha (45,000 speakers); Elugbe (1989) locates this cluster
more specifically within the North Central Branch of Edoid. While a word list supporting a cluster relationship among these dialects was not published, broader classificatory schemes have accepted the cluster interpretation, e.g. Hansford, BendorSamuel and Stanford (1976), Bendor-Samuel (1989) and Crozier and Blench (1992).
Even Christian missionary activity in the area has never generated word lists, since
neither the Bible nor a church hymnal is available in Emai.
Linguistic investigation of individual languages within the Edoid group is extremely limited. Other than Emai, no descriptive grammatical treatment, encompassing reference grammar, lexicon, and texts, has appeared for a single member of
the 25 or more Edoid languages. Perhaps the most widely recognized comparative
and historical analysis of the Edoid group is Elugbe's (1973) unpublished dissertation “A Comparative Edo Phonology” and its successor, Comparative Edoid: Phonology and Lexicon (Elugbe 1989). Also showing an exclusive interest in phonological
matters is Elimelech's (1979) A Tonal Grammar of Etsako, which examines the role of
pitch differences in words and short phrases among dialects of Yekhee spoken
northeast of Emai country.
Among other Edoid studies, Thomas (1910) presents a highly schematic grammatical and lexical analysis of Bini, the numerically and culturally dominant language of the group since establishment of the influential Edo Kingdom in the 13th
Century (Ryder 1969). Later studies of Bini amplify portions of this initial analysis.
Melzian (1937) is a descriptive dictionary from which one can infer grammatical
information at the level of parts of speech, while Amayo (1976) and Wescott (1962)
offer accounts of Bini phonology and morphology. Several linguistic studies of Bini
in pedagogical or descriptive formats have followed. Dunn's (1968) An Introduction
to Bini is a training manual prepared for the American Peace Corps and as such
couches most of its language material in a limited variety of dialogue formats for the
prospective volunteer. An additional pedagogically oriented study is An Edo-English
Dictionary by Agheyisi (1986), which is intended for use in primary and secondary
schools. Stewart (1998) provides a theoretical interpretation of selected serial verb
constructions in Bini.
Additional linguistic studies of Edoid speech varieties tend to be descriptive.
Ejele (1986) provides an overview of selected syntactic issues in Esan. Kari (1997)
provides a brief grammatical sketch of the Delta Edoid language Degema, which is
followed by a more detailed and illustrated descriptive grammar (2004).
As for Emai, an initial lexicon and orthographic statement is offered by Schaefer
(1987), while Egbokhare (1990) presents an initial phonological analysis. An extensive collection of Emai oral tradition texts is found in Oral Tradition Narratives of the
Emai People, Parts I and II (Schaefer and Egbokhare 1999b). This is complemented
more recently by A Dictionary of Emai: An Edoid Language of Nigeria (Schaefer and
Egbokhare 2007). Additional information on Emai is available in a number of papersx | Prefaceby Schaefer and Egbokhare published in a variety of books and journal articles. Of
particular relevance to the future of Emai as a spoken medium is Schaefer and Egbokhare (1999a), which found an intergenerational shift to English as home language in the mid-1990s without a commensurate negative evaluation of vernacular
mother tongue.","[8, 9, 10]"

As expected, SN subjects never admit emphatic pronouns (*kí mèmè / ìyóín gbé' ólí
ófè ò [SN I he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that I / he killed the rat’).
SN subjects allow some impersonal pronouns. Among these are contrastive
demonstrative ónóí (kí ónóí ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN next.one PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It

As SN subject, kindred forms are constrained absolutely. Neither deictic élìyó

ki construction subjects restrict most quantifier pronouns. They do allow collective universal èrèmé (kí èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN all PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely

universal òdóòdé, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé, are unacceptable.
ki subjects limit most numeral pronouns.33 Neither cardinals (e.g. èvá) nor collectives (e.g. èvèvá) occur (*kí èvá / èvèvá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN two all.two PAP.enter LOC

In SN subject position one also finds more complex pronoun constituents.
Among these are pronominal attributives (kí ólí óbín' gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the dark.one

SN constructions greatly limit expression of polarity and mood. They appear as
polar interrogatives (kí ólí ómóhé shén' ólì émà? [SN the man PAP.sell the yam] ‘Isn't
it the case that the man sold the yam?’). However, they never occur as negative
statements, imperatives or prohibitives, as unacceptable negatives suggest (kí ólí

preceding noun phrase as lexical subject (*ólì òkpòsò í yì ólí áwà? [the woman ID identify the dog]
‘Did the woman identify the dog?’).
26Interrogatives with verb yi never occur without Identity pronoun í (*yì ólí ényò [identify the wine]
‘Identify the wine’). In declaratives, the verb yi ‘identify, declare’ occurs with a cognate object (ólì
òjè yí íyì [the chief PRP.declare decree] ‘The chief set forth / made a decree’).
27yi complements disallow existential quantifiers ósò and óvbèé (*í yì ómóhé ósò / óvbèé? [ID identify man certain another] ‘Which one is some / another man?’) and kindred forms élìyó and ódàn (*í yì
úkpún élìyó / ódàn? [ID identify cloth that.kind different.kind] ‘Which one is that kind of / a different
kind of cloth?’). Since these forms identify class rather than membership within a class, they cannot
denote definiteness of a member.
28Lexically headed relative clauses as yi complements do not require the definite article (í yì ómóhé
lí ólí ókpósó róó' émà ní? [ID identify man R the woman PAP.pick.out yam APP] ‘Which one is the
man that the woman gave yam to?’).
29Complements of yi never accept ékà indirect question frames of Cost (*í yì éká lí ólí ómóhé háé'-ì?

by, for example, the definite article (érí' ólí óìà / *óìà ó vbì ìwè [SA the person person PRP.enter LOC
house] ‘Indeed, the person entered the house’).
31SA constructions incorporate generic Habitual statements with bare noun subjects (érí' ívbékhán ó

32SN ki construction subjects disallow nominal óìà ‘human being, person,’ even when modified by

Emai shows three bound pronouns co-referring to a preceding noun phrase. Reflexive and Reciprocal must have their antecedent in the same clause. Logophoric pronoun antecedents cannot be in the same clause.
Logophoric (LOG) pronouns are employed in narrative discourse to track grammatical subject of a communication or cognition verb (Chapter 13, 13.3.3). Limited to
third person, logophoric pronouns reflect case (subject/non-subject grammatical
relations) and number (singular/plural). Their form does not distinguish between
nonsubject position and positions defined by discourse status (i.e. focus or topic).

"2.6.1 Stem reduplication
Stem reduplication exhibits five structural classes. It affects noun, adverbial noun,
pronoun and postdeterminer combinations. The classes vary in their effacement of84 | MorphologyNS-1 final vowel or the portion of NS-2 reduplicated. The resulting reduplicated
forms within the five classes serve primarily as functional rather than lexical items.
For one class of reduplicated forms, the entire stem is repeated. The final vowel
or its tone in NS-1 is thus retained. Members denote relational nouns, temporal adverbials, property nouns, abstract nouns and an item in nature. For some, the semantic effect of reduplication maintains the stem referent while maximally extending a key dimension of referent meaning. For others, reduplication generates a
distinct referent. In one case, the stem referent cannot be synchronically identified.
Relational Noun:
óvbíóvbì ‘grandchild’: óvbì ‘offspring of’
égbéègbé ‘very edge of’: égbè ‘side of’
Temporal Adverbial:
éghèéghè ‘all the time, always’: éghè ‘time’
édèédè ‘daily, everyday’: édè ‘day’
èjéèjé ‘quickly, hastily’: èjé ‘quickly’
Property Noun:
ògbónògbón ‘extremely raw’: ògbòn ‘fresh, new’
Abstract Noun:
áèènáèén ‘social intrigues’: áèèn ‘symbol’
àtáàtà ‘truly, sincerely’: àtà ‘truth’
Bird:
ógbé'nógbé'n ‘crested helmet shrike’: ógbé'n (unknown)
A second class of reduplicated forms shows only partial reduplication. The final
vowel of NS-1 is replaced by a copy of the initial vowel of NS-2, the two showing a
high low tone sequence. Members of this class serve as relational nouns, property
nouns, temporal adverbials and postdeterminers. Since lexemes in this class derive
from noun stems that perform similar syntactic functions, the semantic effect of
reduplication is primarily emphatic.
Relational Noun:
éhéèhón ‘extreme edge of’: éhòn ‘ear, edge’
ágbáàgbán ‘very edge of’: àgbàn ‘chin, edge’
ógbòógbàn ‘absolutely diagonal to’: ógbàn ‘at a diagonal’
ékéèkéín ‘extreme bottom’: ékéìn ‘belly, middle of’
égéègén ‘base of, beneath’: ègèìn ‘crotch, underside’
ògùóògúé ‘systematicity’: ògùè ‘skill’
Property Noun:
òhóòhán ‘wrong, incorrect way’: òhàn ‘wrong way’
èkéèkén ‘sandy’: èkèn ‘sand’Reduplication | 85èréèréé ‘bloody’: èrèè ‘blood’
Temporal Adverbial:
ènyéènyáà ‘just now, right now’: ènyáà ‘just now’
ásàásòn ‘every night, nightly’: ásòn ‘night’
úkpùúkpè ‘every year, yearly’: úkpè ‘year’
Postdeterminer:
ódòódàn ‘very different kind’: ódàn ‘different kind of singleton’
édèédàn ‘very different kind of’: édàn ‘different kind of plurality’
èvéèvá ‘two-two each’: èvá ‘two’ (and other cardinal numerals)
Reduplicated forms of a third class show effacement of NS-1 final vowel and its
tone. Lexemes in this class denote kin terms, relational nouns, temporal adverbials
as well as pre- and post-determiners. Since members derive from noun stems performing similar functions, the semantic effect of reduplication denotes an emphatic
quality or a related but distinct referent.
Kin Term:
ínyìnyò ‘maternal grandmother’: ìnyò ‘mother’
érèrà ‘paternal grandfather’: èrà ‘father’
Relational Noun:
ésèsé ‘midst, exact middle’: ésè ‘center’
ìdàmìdámí ‘distant horizon’: ídámà ‘middle’
Temporal Adverbial:
èdèdé ‘moments ago, earlier’: édè ‘day’
ìsòkpísòkpá ‘immediately, at once’: ìsòkpá ‘once’
Predeterminer / Postdeterminer:
élèlà ‘the time unit we discussed’: élà ‘the time unit we discussed’
èvèvá ‘all two, both’: èvá ‘two’ (other cardinal numerals as well)
ìgbìgbé ‘all ten’: ìgbé ‘ten’
A fourth class of reduplicated forms reveals a distinct pattern of vowel effacement. The initial vowel of NS-2 is omitted. Members of this class derive from pronouns for proximal deictic demonstrative relations and result in pronouns. The
semantic effect of reduplication casts an emphatic quality.
Demonstrative Pronoun:
ónánà ‘this very one’: ònà ‘this one’
énánà ‘these very ones’: ènà ‘these ones’
Reduplicated forms in class five manifest still another pattern of effacement.
The final consonant and vowel (CV) of NS-1 elide. Members of this class are the par-86 | Morphologytitive existential pronoun and a lexical noun of Emai’s socio-cultural vocabulary.
The semantic effect of reduplication is emphatic for the pronoun; for the social role
term, it is relative diminution in status.
Pronoun:
óósò ‘someone’: ósò ‘certain one, some one’
Social Role:
òòbà ‘crown prince’: óbá' ‘Oba’2.6.2 Root reduplication and nominalization
Reduplication of verb roots occurs in the nominalization of verbs from nouns. A
stem is formed by reduplicating a verb root and adjoining it to a vowel prefix. Vowel
prefix types link with reduplicated roots in no obvious pattern, although half open
vowels [o] and [e] fail to appear in these reduplicated forms. For some lexemes, the
root is still synchronically available; for others, it remains opaque. Members of this
class denote physical entities, insects as well as social and climatic conditions.
Physical Entity:
ágbúlúgbùlù ‘cart, vehicle’: gbulu ‘to roll’
ígbúlúgbùlù ‘toys of tin or wood’: gbulu ‘to roll’
íkhùìkhúí ‘yam and plantain mash’: khui (khuikhui ‘to crumble’)
Insect:
ìkhúkhù ‘tiny black insect’: khu ‘to chase’
Social Condition:
ìfùnòfúnó ‘unsteadiness, instability’: funo a ‘to extinguish, flicker’
ìtàlòtáló ‘trash talk’: ta-lo ‘to speak repeatedly’
Climatic Condition:
òkhùàkhùà ‘harmattan wind’: khua (khuakhua ‘to be stiff’)
For another class of lexemes, the verb root undergoing reduplication is often
not synchronically available. Lexeme referents denote food, fish, domestic animals,
celestial bodies, landscape, illness, property and flora of the natural environment.
Since there are no synchronic noun stem forms related to these reduplication lexemes, there is no basis for expecting these forms to involve noun stem reduplication. Wherever possible we have thus posited potential verb roots.

Emai exhibits lexical items that reflect contact with various ethnic groups and their
languages in the relatively recent past. As well, some of these lexemes might reflect
a common historical past. For the moment, we do not pursue this historical matter.
Borrowed lexemes derive from English, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo, among other languages. Most borrowed forms are nouns for concrete or highly abstract objects.
Verbs tend not to be borrowed.
Lexemes that appear borrowed from English denote artifacts, food, locations
and abstractions. Many refer to referents from an English colonial era that persisted
from the 1890s to the 1960s.

Numeral expressions encapsulate within a single semantic domain the range of
Emai morphological types. Analytic compounds, synthetic compounds, derivation
and reduplication are found, as are monomorphemic stem forms. Progressive arithmetic processes of addition and multiplication underlie these lexeme types.
Numbers less than forty are expressed by a root or an analytic compound reflecting addition. Beyond twenty, multiples of twenty are expressed by multiplication, whereas non-multiples of twenty that are still multiples of ten are expressed by
multiplication and addition.
The cardinal numerals for 1-10 are expressed by monomorphemic roots.
òkpá ‘one’
èéà ‘three’
ìíhìèn ‘five’
ìhíón ‘seven’
ìsín ‘nine’èvá ‘two’
èélè ‘four’
èéhàn ‘six’
èén ‘eight’
ìgbé ‘ten’90 | MorphologyNumeral expressions for 11-19 are framed as analytic compounds. Each consists of
the stem ìgbé ‘ten’ followed by a stem selected from 1-9. These analytic compounds
consistently reflect an arithmetic process of addition: ìgbéèvà ‘twelve’ <ìgbé ‘ten’ +
èvà ‘two’>. The only exception is eleven (ìgbóó ‘eleven’ <ìgbé ‘ten’ + óó unknown but
possibly, ‘one’>), whose composition is synchronically opaque.
ìgbóó ‘eleven’
ìgbèéà ‘thirteen’
ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifteen’
ìgbìhíón ‘seventeen’
ìgbìsín ‘nineteen’ìgbéèvà ‘twelve’
ìgbèélè ‘fourteen’
ìgbèéhàn ‘sixteen’
ìgbèén ‘eighteen’Numeral expressions between twenty and forty show a different pattern. Multiples of 10 at 20 and 30 consist of monomorphemic stems.
ùúè ‘twenty’ógbàn ‘thirty’Numeral expressions in the twenties and thirties are framed as syntactic phrases
with Comitative conjunct bíì. The phrases consist of ùúè ‘twenty’ or ógbàn ‘thirty’
followed by bíì and a cardinal numeral root less than 10. Lexemes of this type reflect
an addition process.
ùúè bíì ìíhìèn ‘twenty-five’: ùúè ‘twenty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ùúè bíì òkpá ‘twenty-one’: ùúè ‘twenty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ùúè bíì ìsín ‘twenty-nine’: ùúè ‘twenty,’ bíì, ìsín ‘nine’
ógbàn bíì ìíhìèn ‘thirty-five’: ógbàn ‘thirty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ógbàn bíì òkpá ‘thirty-one’: ógbàn ‘thirty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ógbàn bíì ìsín ‘thirty-nine’: ógbàn ‘thirty,’ bíì, ìsín ‘nine’
Between 40 and 100, multiples of 10 reflect two patterns anchored to whether
they are also multiples of 20. Those with the values 40, 60, 80, 100, 200 and 1600,
for example, are formed by morphological derivation. They are framed by prefix
ègbòò- ‘twenty, score’; it attaches to cardinal root forms. The resulting derivations
reflect a process of multiplication.
ègbòèvá ‘forty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èvá ‘two’
ègbòèéà ‘sixty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èéà ‘three’
ègbòèélè ‘eighty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èélè ‘four’
ègbòìíhìèn ‘one hundred’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ ìíhìèn ‘five’
égbèén ‘one hundred sixty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èén ‘eight’
ègbòìgbé ‘two hundred’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ ìgbé ‘ten’Numeral lexemes and phrases | 91Bimorphemic derived forms act as a base for constructing syntactic phrases 41-49,
61-69, 81-89, 101-109, for example, each framed by Comitative bíì. The resulting
phrases consist of a multiple of 20 followed by bíì and a cardinal stem from 1-9.
ègbòèvá bíì òkpá ‘forty-one’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ègbòèvá bíì ìíhìèn ‘forty-five’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ègbòèéà bíì òkpá ‘sixty-one’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ègbòèéà bíì ìíhìèn ‘sixty-five’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ègbòèélè bíì òkpá ‘eighty-one’: ègbòèélè ‘eighty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ègbòèélè bíì ìíhìèn ‘eighty-five’: ègbòèélè ‘eighty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ègbòìíhèn bíì òkpá ‘one hundred one’: ègbòìíhìèn‘hundred,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ègbòìíhèn bíì ìíhìèn ‘one hundred five’: ègbòìíhìèn ‘hundred,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
Multiples of 10 that are not multiples of 20, i.e. the values 50, 70 and 90, are
framed as syntactic phrases grounded to morphologically derived lexemes. They
consist of the immediately preceding multiple of 20, expressed in its bimorphemic
affixal form, followed by Comitative bíì and the noun for cardinal 10. Multiplication
and addition underlie these numeral expressions.
ègbòèvá bíì ìgbé ‘fifty’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìgbé ‘ten’
ègbòèéà bíì ìgbé ‘seventy’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, ìgbé ‘ten’
ègbòèélè bíì ìgbé ‘ninety’: ègbòèélè ‘eighty,’ bíì, ìgbé ‘ten’
There are two morphosyntactic strategies for expressing numbers expanding each of
the above values to cover 51-59, 71-79, and 91-99. In one, multiples of 20 frame complex syntactic phrases involving a single instance of the Comitative conjunct. Resulting numerals consist of a multiple of 20, bíì and a cardinal stem from 11-19.
ègbòèvá bíì ìgbóó ‘fifty-one’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìgbóó ‘eleven’
ègbòèvá bíì ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifty-five’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifteen’
ègbòèéà bíì igbóó ‘seventy-one’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, ìgbóó ‘eleven’
ègbòèéà bíì ìgbìíhìèn ‘seventy-five’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifteen
ègbòèélè bíì igbóó ‘ninety-one’: ègbòèélè ‘eighty,’ bíì, ìgbóó ‘eleven’
ègbòèélè bíì ìgbìíhìèn ‘ninety-five’: ègbòèélè eighty, bíì, ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifteen’
In an alternative strategy, numerals for 50, 70 and 90 show complex phrases
exhibiting more than one instance of the Comitative. Resulting numerals consist,
respectively, of a multiple of 20 followed by bíì, the cardinal root for 10, another
copy of bíì and a cardinal root selected from 1-9.","[109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117]"

Synthetic compounds in class six also relate to social variables. Members are
formed with prefix ù-, a post-verb noun and the postulated verb kutu,10 which today
can only be inferred from an adverb appearing as an obligatorily reduplicated form
in expressions of the sort ólì àmè ò ó tìn kútúkútú [the water SC C boil seething.fashion] ‘The water is boiling in a seething manner / The water is seething’. kutu
would thus have a general sense referring to the culmination of an activity, as might
occur with the emergence of expressions and personages of cultural significance as
well as maturity among domesticated animals.11 Synthetic compounds with kutu
isolate socially mature members from an assumed larger class and contrast with
analytic compounds that identify immature members, at least for domesticated
animals. Lexemes in the kutu class refer to verbal expressions, human beings and
domesticated animals related to a pastoral way of life.

Domestic Animal:
ùkúté'mèlá ‘cow that has calved’: émèlá ‘cow’
ùkúté'wè ‘goat that has had a kid’: éwè ‘goat’
Analytic compound counterparts for domesticated animal expressions are formed

úlékémèlá ‘heifer’: émèlá ‘cow’
úlékéwè ‘unbred female goat’: éwè ‘goat’82 | MorphologyA final class of synthetic compound is formed with verbs in gerundive form. All
retain the morphological shape prefix+verbal+noun. The verbal characterization is
reflected in a common m segment, assumed to be related to gerundive marker -mi.
Gerundive nominalization normally involves the circumfix ú-VERB-mi. The circumfix ú-mi converts intransitive and transitive activity verbs as well as change of
state verbs to nominals. Activity verb nominals denote physical conditions where
the gerundive has the interpretation ‘condition characterized by or related to VERB,’
as in únyààmí ‘fussiness of children’ from nyaa ‘pamper, fuss over,’ úyàámì ‘odor’
from yaa ‘smell,’ and úgbèmí ‘pulse, sensation’ from gbe ‘beat.’ Change of state
gerundives denote physical entities or existence states where a condition precedes
or follows verb action, as in úvbìàmí ‘pregnancy’ from vbia ‘to give birth,’ úòmí ‘pus’
from oo ‘discharge pus,’ and úvìénmì ‘line, row’ from vien ‘form a line.’
Direct object arguments associated with gerundive forms are typically constrained by a precedence relation. Direcgt objects precede the gerundive (éhéén
úèmí [fish eating] ‘fish eating’) in, for example, éhéén úèmí zé' mé èmìànmì [fish
eating PAP.cause me illness] ‘Eating fish has made me ill’.
As for synthetic compounds in class seven, we hypothesize that each includes a
gerundive with a following nominal. The nominal serves a locus function. The gerundives, none of which occurs as a synchronic form except éhìànmì ‘peeling,’ derive from various verbs, not all of which are synchronically viable. In some cases,
the verb can be inferred only from a synchronic form whose morphological shape
has been augmented by a lexically incorporated postverbal particle, e.g. gua by
change of state a, or from an adverb/adjective with a somewhat similar meaning.
The respective gerundive forms and their hypothesized sources are:
úgùgúm- ‘ridge of’: from verb gua ‘heap, bring to a raised position’
ógògóm- ‘column of’: from verb gon ‘become bent, crooked’
ábàbàm- ‘side of’: from verb ban ‘expose, reveal a body part’
éhìànm- ‘peeling of’: from verb hian ‘cut’
ìkèkèm- ‘piece of’: from verb ken ‘divide’
úkpá'm- ‘strand of’: from verb kpan ‘peel, flay’
úkpùtúm- ‘stump of’: from adjective kpútú ‘stumpy condition’
úkòm- ‘chunk of’: from verb koo ‘remain, leave behind’
údùdúm- ‘cob of’: from adjective dúgbú ‘short stubby,’ dúkú ‘conical’
Synthetic compounds with condition gerundives refer to items of low functional
utility. They derive from nominals with homogeneous or heterogeneous partitive
composition. Synthetic compounds in class seven isolate a remnant of a body-part
locus, useless remains of an artifact / natural kind, or an inedible portion of food.","[106, 107, 108]"

Emai is a terraced-level tone language showing high, low, and down-stepped high.
For some word classes, inherent tone values distinguish words that in all other aspects of sound shape are identical. Nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs in
citation form express lexical meanings through tonal contrasts. Citation forms of
verbs, auxiliaries, and adverbial preverbs generally exhibit no tonal contrast, as
with other Edoid languages (Elugbe 1989). Emai verbs, auxiliaries, and preverbs are
assigned tone values reflecting grammatical properties of their constructions. In
large part these values correlate with the categories indicative and subjunctive
mood. More specifically, major patterns of tonal contrast derive from aspect (perfect, imperfect and prospective), modality (deontic and epistemic) and sentence
complement type.
For Emai words composed of identical segments, predominantly nouns and adverbs, tone values play a distinguishing role. Emai's high (H), down-stepped high
(!H) and low (L) tones combine in various ways within otherwise identical lexical
nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs. In orthographic practice, high tone isSyllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 5represented by an acute accent, low tone by a grave accent, and down-stepped high
by an acute accent immediately followed by a single quote. The last of these tones is
one pitch step lower than an immediately preceding high tone.

‘bicycle’1.4 Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography
Major word classes tend to reflect contrasting syllable structures, although no absolute relation exists between category type and syllable character. All parts of speech
are vowel final. Nouns are uniformly vowel-initial. Verbs tend to be consonant initial, with a few being vowel initial. Adjectives are usually consonant initial, whereas
adverbs are either vowel- or consonant initial. Of the minor categories, some are
predominantly consonant initial with a few vowel initial forms (preverbs, postverbal
particles, complements). Other minor categories are vowel initial (determiners) with
a few consonant initial forms (intensifiers). The preposition class is consonant initial. Concord expression is vowel only with fixed tone patterns.
In pronunciation, the syllabic character of word classes in phrasal or clausal
constructions is normally adjusted by one or another phonological process: vowel6 | Orthography and grammatical overviewelision or glide formation. These processes lead to a divergence between the orthographic practice of employing citation forms and normal-rate pronunciation rendered phonetically. Regardless of phonetic transformation through glide formation
or vowel elision, orthographic practice retains vowel segments in all word classes.
Glide formation affects the close vowels [i] and [u] when they precede non-close
vowels within a lexical or syntactic constituent. These vowels alternate with the
glides [y] and [w], respectively, as illustrated by the verbs fi and ku when followed
by a noun phrase.
fí
ópìà [fyópìà]
throw cutlasskú
àmè [kwàmè]
throw waterUnder specific grammatical conditions, the vowel elision process omits a morpheme-final vowel. Elision differentially affects word classes, revealing complex
interactions between phonological and syntactic parameters. Vowel elision application is restricted across major syntactic constituents like subject/predicate and predicate/adverb. In normal pronunciation of the sentence below, neither the final vowel of the subject noun ókpósó ‘woman’ nor the initial vowel of the verb éhén
‘prepare’ elide. Similarly, neither the final vowel of the direct object ákhé ‘pot’ nor
the initial vowel of the adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ elide. However, the final vowel of the
predeterminer ólì ‘the’ elides, as does the final vowel of the verb éhén.
ólí ókpósó éhén'
ákhé òdè. [ólókpósó éhán'khé òdè]
the woman PAP.prepare pot yesterday
‘The woman prepared a pot yesterday.’
Vowels juxtaposed due to discourse repositioning of constituents are not elided. The
final vowel of noun áwà ‘dog,’ when in clause-initial topic position, is not omitted
relative to the initial vowel of following élì ‘the.’
ólí áwà, élí ímòhè khú
óì. [óláwà élímòhè khú óì]
the dog the men PRP.chase it
‘As for the dog, the men chased it.’
Vowel elision in pronunciation reflects three phonetic patterns that become
transparent most easily with transitive verb phrases. When a lexical direct object
immediately follows a consonant initial verb with a single vowel, the final vowel of
the verb is omitted, while the initial vowel of the direct object is retained. Orthographic representation shows both vowels nonetheless, as shown by comparing
orthographic representations to square bracketed broad phonetic representations.","[29, 30, 31, 32]"
"Noncanonical construction co-occurrence | 4137.7 Noncanonical construction co-occurrence
Constructions reflecting sentence affirmation, sentence negation, positive focus,
negative focus, topic, right dislocation and information question types are constrained in their ability to co-occur. For constructions that relate a discourse defined
position to a corresponding grammatical relation, compatibility is possible only
with distinct grammatical relations. No two constructions are compatible when
affecting the same grammatical relation.
Sentence affirmation and sentence negation establish a baseline for assessing
construction compatibility. Of the two, sentence negation is more restricted. SA érí'
and SN ki are compatible, although érí' must precede ki (*kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé' ófè
[SN SA the man PAP.kill rat] ‘It is not the case, indeed, that the man killed a rat’).
(154) érí' kí ólí ómóhé gbé'
ófè.
SA SN the man PAP.kill rat
‘Indeed, it is not the case that the man killed a rat.’
Sentence affirmation is restricted with other constructions. It appears with topicalization and RD but never with positive focus, negative focus or direct questions. As
shown below, SA and topicalization are compatible, provided the matrix clause
shows relative tense Anterior ke (*ólí ómòhè, érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man SA he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the man, indeed he killed the rat’). Also below, SA érí' follows a topic noun phrase (*érí' ólí ómòhè, ó ké' gbé ólí ófè [SA the man he PAP.ANT

‘As for Oje, indeed he was afterward taken squirming.’
Sentence affirmation and right dislocation are compatible. érí' precedes a matrix

[SA what the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, what did the man kill?’).
Sentence negation co-occurs with only two construction types, although in neither does SN ki occur clause initially. As indicated previously, sentence negation cooccurs with sentence affirmation provided ki follows érí'. In addition, SN combines
with topicalization. It never combines with positive focus, negative focus, right
dislocation or information questions.
Sentence negation co-occurs with topicalization as shown immediately below,
provided the topic phrase precedes ki (*kì ólí ómòhè, ó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man he

who he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case who killed the rat’).
The remaining construction types, all of which show a discourse defined position, exhibit varying degrees of compatibility. Information questions are the most
severely restricted.
Topic position combines with positive focus, negative focus and direct questions. It fails with right dislocation. No matter the other construction, the topic constituent appears in leftmost position (*ólí ómòhè lí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man PF the
rat he PAP.kill it] ‘It was the man, as for the rat, who killed it’). When topic and positive focus position co-occur, topic precedes the li/ni marked focus constituent.

íyòìn lí ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [the rat he PF the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for the rat, it was he
who the man killed’).
When topic and negative focus both occur, topic precedes the negative focus
noun phrase, never the reverse (*ólí ómòhè kí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man NF the rat he

When topic and information question frames co-occur, topic precedes the question word (*ébé' ólí ómòhè, ó' yé? [where the man he PAP.move.to] ‘Where, as for the
man, did he move to?’, *émé' ólí ómòhè, ó ré' híán ólí óràn? [what the man he

í khì ólí úkpùn [the man he PRP.sell it ID be the cloth] ‘As for the man, he sold it, that
is the cloth’).
Positive focus shows extremely limited compatibility with other construction
types. It co-occurs with topic, as already indicated, and right dislocation but not
with negative focus and information questions.
Positive focus and right dislocation are compatible, although crossover of
grammatical relations constrains grammatical acceptability. When matrix grammatical subject corresponds to positive focus, matrix direct object in a monotransitive
complement can correspond to a right dislocated constituent. However, a direct
object in a monotransitive complement that corresponds to a focus position noun
phrase never co-occurs with a subject that corresponds to a constituent in RD position (*ólí úkpùn lí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the cloth PF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man]

that it was the man who moved?’, *ólí ómòhè lí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man PF where he
PAP.move.to-F] ‘It was the man who to where did he move?’).
Negative focus also shows limited co-occurrence with other construction types.
It appears with topic, as already seen, and right dislocation, but not with positive
focus or direct questions. Negative focus and right dislocation are compatible, although crossover of grammatical relations in the matrix clause limits combinations.
Subject corresponds to a constituent in negative focus position when a direct object
corresponds to right dislocated position.

‘It was the man who killed it, that is the rat.’
But a direct object that corresponds to negative focus position never co-occurs with
a subject that corresponds to right dislocated position (*ólí úkpùn kí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí
ómòhè [the cloth NF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man] ‘It wasn’t the cloth that he sold,
that is the man’, *ólí ófè kí ó gbé'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the rat NF he PAP.kill-F ID be the
man] ‘It wasn’t the rat that he killed, that is the man’).
Negative focus never co-occurs with information questions. Even with distinct
grammatical relations affected, NF and questions are incompatible (*ébé' ólí ómòhè
kí ó yé'-ì? [where the man NF he PAP.move.to-F] ‘Where if it wasn’t the man did he
go to?’, *ólí ómòhè kí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man NF where he PAP.move.to-F] ‘It wasn’t
the man so where did he move to?’).
As indicated previously, right dislocation co-occurs with positive focus, negative focus and with information questions. It never combines with topicalization. RD
and information questions are compatible provided distinct matrix relations are
involved. Moreover, crossover of subject to right dislocated position and direct object to question position is acceptable.

í khì ólí ómòhè?

In addition, the constraint limiting RD to subject or direct object does not apply
under a question condition. Indirect objects marked by Applicative li/ni appear in
RD position with question words corresponding to subject or direct object.","[438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443]"
"100 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsSegmental forms in the categories of inflection, auxiliary and preverb exhibit
fixed or variable tone. Most auxiliary and preverb categories are assigned tone values by inflection. They thus show variable high, low or contour tone relative to the
fixed tone of inflectional elements conveying affirmative and negative aspect. Exceptions to this general rule are irrealis forms such as Hortative, Hypothetical and
the Conative preverb, which reveal a fixed tone. Across the categories aspect, modality, relative tense and preverb, tone value and morpheme sense interrelate. Some
segmental forms exhibit alternating tonal values (high and low) that co-vary with
alternating tonal values of the subject phrase. Each tone-form combination denotes
a distinct grammatical function. Other segmental forms show a single tone that
combines with alternating tonal values of the subject phrase. In this case, too, each
tone-form combination designates a distinct grammatical function. And still other
segmental forms manifest a single tone, combine with a single subject phrase tone,
and designate a single grammatical function.
Two tone patterns characterize subject phrase exponents. One appears on a
pronoun that shows either a low tone (ò ‘he, she, it’) or high tone (ó ‘he, she, it’). A
second appears on a lexically specified noun phrase with a right edge low tone (òjè
‘Oje,’ ólí ómòhè ‘the man,’ ólí ómóhé nà ‘this man’) or a right edge high tone (ójé, ólí
ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná). Right edge tone on grammatical subject affects expression of
inflection as well as auxiliary, relative tense and preverbs.","[125, 126]"

Number agreement across focus and corresponding matrix clause position is required. A plural noun phrase (élí ímòhè) in focus position corresponds to third person plural nominative pronoun, either e or yan depending on matrix clause aspect

verb za ‘be located’ in series. Not retained in focus or matrix clause position is vbi.

A third marking strategy affects remaining grammatical relations. When a matrix monotransitive verb is morphosyntactically bare, i.e. contains no auxiliary or
preverb morpheme and no marker of imperfect or prospective aspect, direct object
position shows a zero pronoun and the verb displays Factative suffix -i.1 Adjunct
constituents like adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ do not upset this bare condition.

An additional constraint on Factative suffixation occurs under conditions of
complex predication. Factative assignment shows four exceptions, with each exception showing a zero pronoun. The exceptions have in common the addition of morphological material to an otherwise simple predication. When their direct object
corresponds to a focus position constituent, split verbs do not admit Factative -i (mi
dan ‘swallow’ in ólí ómóhé mí ùkèlè dán ‘The man swallowed a morsel’).

APP li/ni, Chapter 9) do not accept Factitive -i when their direct object position corresponds to a focus constituent. Verbs like shen that take a direct object and an
indirect object (lí ólì òkpòsò) show only a zero pronoun when their direct object
position corresponds to a focus position constituent (ólí úkpùn). And verbs like gbe
that show a direct object followed by the Change of State particle a do not take Factative -i when their direct object corresponds to a focus position constituent.

direct object corresponds to a focus constituent.

postverbal position.

The noun phrase position defined by affirmative and negative focus constructions
reflects few lexical constraints. Nonetheless, it restricts lexical modification and
pronominal type. Focus position marked as affirmative or negative accepts various
nominal types ranging from proper names to count and mass nouns varying in animacy. For instance, focus position accepts proper names (e.g. òlólò).
(18) òlólò lí / kí ó gbé'
ólí ófè.
Ololo PF NF he PAP.kill the rat

Focus position restricts postdeterminers in each of the classes demonstrative,
kindred, numeral and quantifier. Deictic and contrastive demonstratives modify
focus position nouns. Deictic demonstratives appear in either positive or negative
focus position: proximal nà (ólí ómóhé nà lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man this PF NF he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn't this man who killed the rat’) and distal áìn (ólí
ómóhé áìn lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man that PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn't
that man who killed the rat’). Contrastive demonstrative nóì, which never occurs
with the definite predeterminer, is found in affirmative but not negative focus constituents (ómóhé nóì lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man next PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was
the next man who killed the rat’).
Kindred modifiers, which never combine with the definite article, show limitations across focus polarity types. Deictic kindred élìyó appears in both affirmative
and negative focus positions (ófé élìyó lí / kí ó ó' vbì òò [rat that.kind PF NF it
PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was / wasn't that kind of rat that entered the hole’). Contrastive kindred ódàn is restricted to positive focus position (ófé ódàn lí / *kí ó ó' vbì òò
[rat different.kind PF NF it PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was a different kind of rat that
entered the hole’).
Quantifier types are constrained in their distribution across affirmative and
negative focus constructions. The collective universal quantifier èrèmé, with optional definite predeterminer, appears in focus position, irrespective of focus polarity ((élí) ímóhé èrèmé lí / kí é ó' vbì ìwè [the men all PF NF they PAP.enter LOC house]
‘It was / wasn't all the men that entered the house’). However, the distributive universal quantifier òdóòdé is never acceptable, regardless of focus polarity (*ímóhé
òdóòdé lí / kí é ó' vbì ìwè [men each PF NF they PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't each of the men that entered the house’).
Existential quantifiers, which never co-occur with the definite article, are not
distributed symmetrically across focus polarity types. Limited to positive focus constructions are partitive existential quantifier ósò (ómóhé ósò lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè
[man certain PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was a certain man who killed the rat’) and
contrastive existential quantifier óvbèé (ómóhé óvbèé lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man an-354 | Noncanonical constructionsother PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was another man who killed the rat’). They fail
with negative focus ki.
Cardinal numerals greater than ‘one’ appear in focus position, regardless of
their co-occurrence with the definite article, e.g. èvá ‘two’ ((élí) éfè èvá lí / kí é ó' vbì
òò [the rats two PF NF they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was / wasn't (the) two rats who
entered the hole’). Collective numerals, which do not co-occur with the definite
article, modify nouns in positive or negative focus position, e.g. èvèvá ‘both, all two
of’ (éfè èvèvá lí / kí é ó' vbì òò [rats all.two PF NF they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was /
wasn't both rats that entered the hole’). With an otherwise unmodified noun, numeral òkpá ‘one’ occurs in positive or negative focus position (ómòhè òkpá lí / kí ó ó'
vbì ìwè [man one PF NF he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't one man who entered the house’). In addition, emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone’ modifies nouns
marked as definite in positive or negative focus position (ólí ómòhè òkpá lí / kí ó ó'
vbì ìwè [the man alone PF NF he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't the man
alone who entered the house’).
Focus position noun phrases also accept nonlexical postdeterminers. Focus
noun phrases take as postnominal modifiers Associative ísì phrases (éwé ísì ólì
òkpòsò lí / kí ó ó' vbì ìwè [goat ASS the woman PF NF it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was
/ wasn’t the goat of the woman that entered the house’), Relator li phrases (éwé lí
óbín' lí / kí ó ó' vbì ìwè [goat R dark PF NF it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn’t
the dark goat that entered the house’) and relative clause li/ni constituents (ómóhé lí
ó dá' ólí ényò lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man R he PAP.drink the wine PF NF he PAP.kill the
rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the man who drank the wine who killed the rat’). Speaker preference is for focus constituents without definite article ólì/élì.
Pronominal forms also occupy focus position. Irrespective of construction polarity, focus position accepts personal and impersonal pronouns. However, constraints
apply that affect case as well as person and number agreement. Among personal
pronouns, only emphatic forms (e.g. ìyàìn, mèmè) appear in focus position. Emphatic personal pronouns must agree in person and number with their matrix clause
anaphoric pronoun (yan or i). Across focus polarity types, emphatic pronouns in
focus position accept emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone.’

‘It was / wasn't they alone who killed the rat.’
Focus position attracts impersonal pronouns from demonstrative, kindred, numeral and quantifier classes with few restrictions. Each demonstrative pronounNoun phrase focus | 355occurs in focus position: distal deictic óáìn (óáìn lí / kí ó gbé' ófè [that.one PF NF it
PAP.kill rat] ‘It was /wasn’t that one who killed a rat’), proximal ònà (ònà lí / kí ó
gbé' ófè [this.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It was / wasn’t this one who killed a rat’),
emphatic proximal ónánà (ónánà lí / kí ó gbé' ófè [this.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It
was / wasn’t this very one who killed a rat’), as well as contrastive demonstrative
ónóì (ónóì lí / (*kí ) ó gbé' ófè [next.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It was the next one who
killed a rat’).
Both kindred pronouns occur in focus position: deictic élìyó (élìyó lí / kí ólí
ómóhé gbé'-ì [that.kind PF NF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't that kind of one
that the man killed’) and contrastive ódàn (ódàn lí / kí ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [different.kind PF NF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't a different kind of one that the
man killed’).3
Focus position accepts few quantifier pronouns.4 It takes the collective universal quantifier èrèmé (èrèmé lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [all PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F]
‘It was / wasn't all that the woman killed’). Ungrammatical in focus position are the
distributive universal quantifier òdóòdé as well as both existential pronouns (ósò
and óvbèé).
Focus position accepts numeral pronouns greater than ‘one’ in their cardinal
form, e.g. èvá (èvá lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [two PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was
/ wasn’t two that the woman killed’) or collective form, e.g. èvèvá (èvèvá lí / kí ólí
ókpósó gbóó'-ì [all.two PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn’t both that the
woman killed’). As head of a partitive vbi phrase, cardinal numerals also occur in
focus position, e.g. èvá (èvá vbì ò lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [two LOC it PF NF the
woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't two of them that the woman killed’).5
Numeral pronoun ‘one’ appears in focus position, as cardinal òkpá (òkpá lí / kí
ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì [one PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't one that the
woman killed’) or partitive úkpòkpá (úkpòkpá vbì ò lí /*kí ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì [one LOC
it PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was one of them that the woman killed’). However, úkpòkpá only occurs in positive focus.
Focus position also accepts expressions framed as pronominally headed relative
clauses (ólí ó (*á) dé' ólí úkpùn lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [one he RC PAP.buy the cloth PF
NF it PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the one who bought the cloth who killed the
rat’) or attribution phrases (ólí óbín' lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the dark.one PF NF it
PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the dark one who killed the rat’). Pronominally
headed relatives only occur in focus position under conditions of specific reference.
Generic reference (e.g. ‘whoever’) induced by Recurrent preverb a in the relative
clause renders them unacceptable.","[374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381]"
"8.2.2 Age construction u / vbi
In age constructions, the forms u and vbi occur in complementary distribution or
they alternate freely. This alternation reminds one of the nominal classifying copula
u/vbi (Chapter 8, 8.1.3). However, the copula form does not allow deontic and epistemic modality auxiliary forms. Age constructions do. Emai age constructions thus
employ transitive u ‘do’ where English relies on ‘be.’

Intransitive u has the sense ‘do.’ When it occurs with a manner adjunct such as
lèsèn ‘well,’ ìyó ‘that way’ or ìná ‘this way,’ it contributes to construction sense ‘act,
behave, perform.’ Noun phrase and verb phrase properties in intransitive u constructions are partially constrained. It is the case, however, that intransitive u shows
polarity and mood potential and allows discourse repositioning of its arguments.

‘Don't act that way’), negative statements (ólì òkpòsò í ì ù ìyó [the woman SC NEG do

Intransitive u grammatical positions correspond to distinct interrogative pronouns.

Intransitive u constructions with manner demonstrative adjuncts restrain the
expression of verb phrase properties. Although intransitive u disallows verbal affixes, it selectively occurs with inflection, auxiliary, preverb, postverbal particle and
temporal adjunct categories. Relative to verbal affixes, intransitive u accepts neither
Perseverative Ci-, Factative -i nor Distributive -lo/lo/no (*élí ímòhè ú-ló ìyó [the men

Associative phrases unmarked by ísì/ésì express spatial orientation or kin relations.
Corresponding phrases consist of two ordered nominal positions with left position
undergoing high tone spread.144.3.3.2.1
Spatial and directional orientation
Unmarked associative phrases show a spatial orientation nominal followed by a
reference point nominal or a directional nominal followed by a reference point nominal. Spatial orientation terms derive from two primary sources. One subclass has its
source in body-part terms.

égéín ìtèbù [ègèìn ‘crotch’]

instances, e.g. ókpòtóí, the landscape term is embedded in a synthetic compound.

top

‘top of the hill’ókpòtóí ókòó

ésèsé úkpódè
center road
‘center of the road’
As already shown (Chapter 4, 4.3.3.1.4.), when a human or animate noun occurs
as reference point in some spatial orientation associative phrases, ísì is obligatory
(úókhó ísì ólí ómòhè ‘behind/in back of the man,’ *úókhó ólí ómòhè ‘behind the
man’). When a place noun serves as reference point, ísì is unacceptable (*úókhó ísì
úgbà ‘behind the fence,’ *ókhúnmí ísì ìwè ‘on top of the house’).

predeterminers, e.g. definite article, or postdeterminers, e.g. distal demonstrative.

Kinship relations
Kin relation phrases are unmarked by Associative ísì and reflect two classes. Kinship
is articulated as a blood or nonblood relation relative to “ego” expressed as animate
possessor. The kin term manifests high tone spread and precedes possessor.
Kin constituent position accepts nouns differing as to grammatical number and
syntactic distribution. One class is illustrated by kin terms expressing parental and
nonparental relations. Parental relation terms (ínyó, érá) do not inflect for grammatical number.","[228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"

Afuze PRP.be LOC yonder

Impersonal pronouns reflect demonstrative, kindred, quantifying and numeral classes. All but demonstrative are identical in phonological shape to corresponding
nominal postdeterminer modifiers (Chapter 4, 4.3.2). Except for numerals and universal quantifiers, impersonal pronouns inflect for number with a vowel prefix. And
all except numerals show a nondeictic, contrastive member.
Demonstrative pronouns include deictic and nondeictic, contrastive members.
Deictic demonstrative pronouns differentiate proximal/distal through their root and
express number by vowel prefix alternation: óáìn ‘that one,’ ònà ‘this one,’ éáìn
‘those ones,’ ènà ‘these ones.’ Their root forms are identical in phonological shape
to demonstrative postdeterminer modifiers, i.e. áìn, nà. Deictic demonstrative pronouns reject all modifier types. A nondeictic, contrastive demonstrative pronoun
also conveys number by vowel prefix alternation: ónóì ‘next one,’ énóì ‘next ones.’
In contrast to other impersonal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns never occur
as head of a partitive vbi phrase (*óáín/óná/ónóí vbí élí ívbèkhàn ‘that one/this
one/the next one of the youths’). Constrained by number, demonstrative pronouns
occupy noun phrase positions. They refer to participants in the situational context.

énóí ‘the next ones,’ do not co-refer to an antecedent in a preceding sentence.

Deictic demonstrative pronouns interact with deictic elements elsewhere in a
clause. They are incompatible with locative reference points specified as clauses
within which a deictic pronoun (e.g. í ‘I’) occurs. The contrastive demonstrative
pronoun is not restricted in this same fashion.

next.one PRP.be LOC where I PAP.be
‘The next one is where I am. / The one at hand is where I am.’
Kindred pronouns exhibit deictic as well as nondeictic, contrastive forms. For
deictic kindred, proximal/distal is conveyed by two root morphemes and singular/plural by vowel prefix alternation. Among older Emai speakers, four deictic
kindred forms reflecting proximal/distal and singular/plural are available: ónìná
‘this kind of one,’ énìná ‘these kind of ones,’ ólìyó ‘that kind of one,’ élìyó ‘those kind
of ones.’ Younger speakers utilize only the erstwhile plural forms élìyó and énìná for
deictic kindred pronoun relations. Irrespective of age group, there is a nondeictic,
contrastive kindred pronoun. It inflects for number through vowel prefix alternation: ódàn ‘one of different kind,’ édàn ‘ones of different kind.’
The contrastive kindred singular form partially reduplicates and exhibits distributive reference (ódòódàn ‘ones of a different kind’). There is no comparable plural form (*édèédàn ‘ones of different kind’). Contrastive kindred ódán occurs in a
partitive phrase as head relative to an immediately following vbi preposition and its260 | Pronouns and conjunctioncomplement. The complement can be headed by a relational noun such as úsèé
‘crowd’ followed by Associative ísì and a plural nominal. However, plural vbi phrase
complements that lack a relational noun like úsèé are unacceptable (*ódán vbí élí
íkpùn ‘different kind of one from the cloths’).

vbí úsèé ísì ìyáín

Kindred pronoun énìná ‘one of this kind’ displays combinatorial potential relative to postnominal modifiers. In doing so, it neutralizes the plural number value of
its prefix. énìná combines with the contrastive demonstrative modifier, although not
with either deictic demonstrative.

do not reflect person, case, gender, or discourse status. Existential quantifier forms
inflect for number via prefixation.
Universal quantifier pronouns manifest the types collective (èrèmé ‘all, everyone, everything’) and distributive (òdóòdé ‘each one’). Distributive exhibits limited
occurrence, since it refers only to humans. Existential quantifiers show contrasting
root forms that inflect for number with alternating vowel prefixes: ósò ‘certain one,’
ésò ‘certain ones’ and óvbèé ‘another one,’ évbèé ‘other ones.’
Quantifiers in partitive vbi phrases exhibit restricted distribution. Partitive existential ósò appears as head relative to a prepositional vbi phrase, whose complement is marked inflectionally (e.g. ívbèkhàn not óvbèkhàn) or syntactically (e.g. élí)
as plural or is construed as plural.

Quantifier pronouns, as anaphors, show distinct distribution patterns. Collective universal quantifier èrèmé co-refers to an antecedent noun phrase in a preceding sentence.

Oje PRP.dig the yam he PRP.take all
move.to market
‘Oje harvested the yams. He took all to market.’Impersonal pronouns | 263Pronouns that do not directly co-refer as anaphors relative to a preceding noun
phrase are distributive universal òdóòdé (*òjè gá élí ívbèkhàn zè. ò húá òdóòdé yé ìwè
[Oje PRP.meet the youths he PRP.take each move.to house] ‘Oje met the youths. He
took each one to the house’) as well as partitive existential ósò (*òjè tón élí émà. ò
nwú ósò yé èkìn [Oje PRP.dig the yams he PRP.take certain.one move.to market] ‘Oje

Nonetheless, partitive existential ósò occurs with a following vbi phrase and its
nondeictic locative pronoun ò as complement (ósó vbì ò). Through obligatory construal of the vbi complement as plural, and direct coreference of this complement
with an antecedent noun phrase, ósò co-refers indirectly. No other quantifier displays similar indirect anaphoric behavior.

Numeral pronouns greater than ‘one’ include the types cardinal (e.g. èvá ‘two’),
ordinal (e.g. ózèvà ‘second’), collective (e.g. èvèvá ‘all two, both, twosome’) and
distributive (e.g. èvéèvá ‘two-two each’). Each type is identical in phonological
shape to its corresponding postdeterminer. Numeral òkpá ‘one’ shows distinct cardinal (òkpá ‘one’) and distributive forms (òkpóòkpá ‘one-one each’). And since it
expresses ‘same’ with respect to kin relations, it reflects a collective sense as well.
Numeral pronouns occur in the syntactic relations subject and direct object,
where they refer to participants in the situational context. Only ordinal forms require the definite predeterminer.

Numeral pronouns exhibit restricted distribution in partitive phrases. Cardinal
numeral pronouns occur as partitive head, where they are followed by a prepositional vbi phrase whose complement consists of a plural lexical form or the nondeictic locative pronoun ò. Deictic locatives (e.g. èvbò) as complement are disallowed.
èvá vbí élí émà / élí ívbèkhàn / *ólí óvbèkhàn
two LOC the yam the youths
the youth
‘two of the yams / youths’
èvá vbí ò / *èvbò
two LOC it yonder
‘two of them / *two from yonder’
Partitive phrase head rejects collective, ordinal and distributive numerals.
*èvèvá vbí élí ívbèkhàn
both LOC the youths
‘both of the youths’*ólí ózévá
vbí élí ívbèkhàn
the second.one LOC the youths
‘the second one of the youths’Under conditions of singular reference, derived form úkpòkpá ‘one’ appears in partitive phrases in lieu of cardinal form òkpá ‘one.’
úkpòkpá vbí élí ívbèkhàn
one
LOC the youths
‘one of the youths’*òkpá vbí élí ívbèkhàn
one LOC the youths
‘one of the youths’Numeral pronouns do not uniformly appear as anaphors. Collective (èvèvá) and
cardinal (èvá) numeral shapes corefer to a noun phrase referent in a preceding sentence. Distributive (èvéèvá) and ordinal (ólí ózèvà) numerals, however, fail to corefer in a similar fashion.","[282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290]"

d. òjè nwú

Oje PRP.take yam CL LOC road
‘Did Oje put yam onto the road?’
Complex predicates with CL o do not inhibit discourse repositioning of arguments.
Predication subjects, direct objects and locative complements correspond to focus
position marked by li/ni.
(38) a. òjè lí ó nwú'
ólí émà ó vbí úkpódè.
Oje PF he PAP.take the yam CL LOC road
‘It was Oje who put the yam onto the road.’
b. ólí émá áìn lí ójé nwú'

c. úkpódé nà lí ójé nwú'
ólí émà ó.

this PF Oje PRP.take the yam CL
‘It was this road that Oje put the yam on.’
Five other functions associate with CL o. In large measure, these functions reflect verb semantics (change of state or change of location) or vbi phrase nominal.
One function occurs when vbi complement is headed by a time nominal (e.g. éghè
‘time’). In such instances CL o predications convey event temporal goal.
(39) a. ólì òkpòsò é
émàè ó vbí éghè.
the woman PRP.eat food CL LOC time
‘The woman ate on time.’
b. ójé ísì òkè hí
ókhòìn ó vbì ùsúmú éènà.
Oje ASS Oke PRP.schedule war
CL LOC 9.days today
‘The Oje of Oke scheduled the war for a fortnight from today.’
Complex predicates with CL o, instead of specifying a final destination, articulate a
locative reference point function for an event. This occurs when predication verbChange of location | 529specifies change of state or change of position for the subject argument, as in fu
‘waste,’ ghogho ‘break,’ and fi ‘leave.’
(40) a. ìbòbòdí fú'
ó vbí ímè.
cassava PAP.waste CL LOC farm
‘Cassava wasted on the farm.’
b. ólí ómòhè gúóghó
úkpàsánmì ó mé vbì òè.
the man
PRP.break cane
CL my LOC foot
‘The man broke a cane on my foot.’
c. ólì òkpòsò fí
ólí úkpùn ó vbì ìwè.
the woman PRP.leave the cloth CL LOC house
‘The woman left the cloth at home.’
A third function results when vbi’s complement consists of a numeral. The complex
CL o predicate must then express a change of quantitative state. Either intransitive
subject or transitive direct object undergoes a change of quantitative state.
(41) a. ólì òkpòsò híán
ólí úì
ó vbì ódè èvá.
the woman PRP.cut the rope CL LOC parts two
‘The woman cut the rope into two parts.’
b. ólí úì
híán
ó vbí ódè èvá.
the rope PRP.cut CL LOC parts two
‘The rope got cut into two parts.’
Complex CL o predicates also express a reciprocal exchange function. A subject or
direct object argument undergoes exchange relative to a vbi marked argument. In
such cases, the vbi complement (ògèdè, émàè) serves as an exchanged commodity.
(42) a. ólí ómòhè háé
ìnáírà èvá ó vbì ògèdè.
the man PRP.pay naira two CL LOC banana
‘The man paid / exchanged two naira for the bananas.’
b. ólí ómòhè bíá
ó vbí émàè.
the man PRP.work CL LOC food
‘The man worked for food / worked in exchange for food.’
For yet another function, complex predicates with CL o vbi o and intransitive stative
verbs express state change. The vbi complement must show the nondeictic locative
pronoun o. The verbs involved denote a physical dimension or physical appearance.
State change predications with o vbì o express scalar, incremental change with no
inherent end point. Most but not all of these predications require Continuous or
Habitual aspect.","[553, 554, 555]"

Alternative forms articulate direct and indirect questions of Person. An interrogative
pronoun with the number shapes singular óe'/ói' and plural éé'/éí' frame Person
direct questions. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular o, plural e) occurs in matrix
subject position. For indirect object position marked by Applicative li/ni, a zero
pronoun corresponds to the interrogative pronoun for person.

Indirect questions of Person rely on the relative pronoun ólì/élì with its singular/plural forms. Question position in indirect interrogatives never accepts pronoun

appropriately shaped for case and number (singular ó, plural é) occupies subject

Direct and indirect questions of Possessor are framed by Person interrogative pronouns and relative pronouns. However, question shape varies according to direct or
indirect status. Direct questions utilize interrogative pronoun óé'/óí'~éé'/éí' as complement of an Associative ísì phrase, the entire phrase being in question position.
(83) a. éwé ísì óé' ólí ómóhé nwú'

b. éwé ísì éé' ólí ómóhé nwú'
lí
ònwìmè?
goat ASS who the man PAP.take APP farmer
‘Whose goat did the man give to the farmer?’
Indirect questions of Possessor assume either of two shapes. When the question
position constituent corresponds to a matrix relation other than subject, the relative
pronoun ólì appears in question position and a personal pronoun (òí) occupies the
corresponding matrix clause position.17
(84) a. ì één

c. *ì één
éwé ísì ólí ójé nwú'
lí
ònwìmè.
I PRP.know goat ASS one Oje PAP.take APP farmer
‘I knew whose goat Oje gave to the farmer.’
When the question constituent in an indirect question with Possessor corefers to
matrix clause subject, an entire Associative ísì phrase (éwé ísì ólí) occurs in embedded clause initial position. The relative pronoun ólí serves as Possessor. Subject in
the matrix clause then requires a personal pronoun (e.g. ó).

"Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 7gbé áwà [gbáwà]
kill dogdé óràn
buy wood[dóràn]Verbs defined by a single nasal vowel reflect a second pattern. In pronunciation, the
vowel itself is omitted but its nasal quality is retained and assumed by the initial
vowel of the ensuing noun phrase. Again, phonetic and orthographic representations diverge.
sén áwà [sánwà]
stab dogtón ímòhè [tínmòhè]
bury menStill a third phonetic pattern is exhibited by verbs with a sequence of identical vowels (koo ‘read’). In pronunciation, the sequence shortens when a lexical direct object
follows; it does not elide entirely. Comparison to a single vowel verb (ko ‘plait’)
illustrates the contrast. Orthographic presentation of each verb is consistent with its
citation form.
kóó ébè [kóébè]
read bookkó
émà [kémà]
plant yamLastly, verb final vowels do not elide when followed by a pronominal direct object.
sá óì [sáóì]
fetch itgbé óì [gbéóì]
kill itOrthographic and broad phonetic representations exhibit varying degrees of
congruency in the case of word formation. Since both vowel elision and glide formation are evident in the pronunciation of compounds and nominalizations, identification of morpheme elements is often obscured by vowel omission. To maintain
some level of morpheme transparency in orthographic practice, elided vowels in
compounds and nominalizations are accounted for in two ways.
Nominalized word forms in pronunciation exhibit no major incongruency relative to orthographic practice. Nouns derived from a verb by prefix addition, show no
vowel elision.
àòó ‘thought’
èkpà ‘vomit’oo ‘to think’
kpa ‘to vomit’Compound forms, however, pose potential problems for orthographic practice.
Vowels at word boundaries within compounds are subject to elision. When the verb
in a verb-noun compound is transitive (e.g. ze ‘scrape,’ da ‘drink’), its single vowel8 | Orthography and grammatical overviewis elided. Comparison of forms for ‘barber’ and ‘drunkard’ reveal how only the
sound shapes of prefix and noun, but not verb, are consistent across broad phonetic
form and orthographic practice.
òzètò
[ò-ze-étò]
‘barber’ prefix-scrape-hairòdènyò
[ò-da-ényò]
‘drunkard’ prefix-drink-wineElision also affects nasal vowels in verb-noun compounds but not in the manner
evident in syntactic constructions. Whereas only the vowel of a verb is elided in
syntactic phrases, both the vowel and its nasal quality (e.g. ken ‘divide’ and kpen ‘be
next to’) tend to be effaced in compounds.

‘twin kernels’ prefix-divide-twoókpòkhúnmí [ó-kpen-òkhùnmì]

except for the final vowel of the compound’s left constituent.
ákòísí' [àkò
òísí']
‘holster’ sheath gunákùhàì [àkò

‘quiver’ sheath arrowElision is also evident in word formation involving reduplication. Forms referring to relationships of time and space involve reduplication of an entire root (e.g.
ésè ‘center of’ and édè ‘day’), with accompanying elision of the initial constituent’s
morpheme-final vowel. Orthographic practice shows the vowel as elided.

Basic grammatical relations in Emai show the order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
Declarative statements with transitive verbs reveal a subject noun phrase (ólí ómòhè
‘the man’) followed by a verb (é ‘eat’) and its direct object (ólí émàè ‘the food’).
(1) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè.
the man PRP.eat the food
‘The man has eaten the food.’
Sentence types contrast with respect to voice-register and tonal pattern. Imperative
constructions utilize a normal voice register.
(2) è ólí émàè.
eat the food
‘Eat the food.’
Declaratives rely on a normal voice register as well.
(3) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè.
the man PRP.eat the food
‘The man has eaten the food.’
However, polar interrogatives (yes/no questions), while manifesting the same word
order as declaratives and essentially the same tonal patterns, employ a higher pitch
register.
(4) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè?
the man PRP.eat the food
‘Has the man eaten the food?’
Rhetorical questions are also expressed through this higher register, adding a final
extra-high tone (e.g. é) to a lexical low tone (émàè).
(5) ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàèé?
the man SC C eat the food
‘The man is eating the food, is he?’10 | Orthography and grammatical overview1.6 Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution
Tonal configurations in Emai reveal the interaction of lexical tone with syntactic
tone values derived from grammatical categories and their placement. Traditional
phrase heads such as nouns and verbs exhibit tonal variability controlled by presence or absence of modifying constituents or of adjacent phrases. For purposes of
illustration, we rely on noun phrases and monotransitive or ditransitive verb
phrases to convey an overview of the nature of this variability, although a full account of principles underlying sentence, clause and phrase tone remains to be undertaken.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

èvèvá), collective universal quantifier (èrèmé) or partitive existential quantifier
(ésò). These forms occur in situ or in simple syntactic phrases but not in Specifier
copula óò constructions. Among existential quantity forms, it is only contrastive
existential quantifier évbèé that is unacceptable.

Quantity questions with partitive sense take either of two patterns with ékà and a
noun.22 Either ékà appears after a bare count noun in question position or ékà appears in question position and, in the matrix clause, a count noun modified by definite article élí remains in a vbi marked partitive phrase.23

The interrogative form ékà frames lexical and phrasal questions of Cost. Lexical cost
questions relate to subject and direct object positions. ékà Cost questions occur
when the matrix clause shows a verb whose direct object is subcategorized for cost,
e.g. hae ‘pay.’ Direct questions of Cost with these verbs show ékà in question position, while indirect questions show ékà as head of a li/ni marked relative clause.

As well, ékà questions occur when Cost corresponds to subject. Direct questions of
Cost appear in Equational Identity í khi constructions, where ékà in question position corresponds to Identity subject pronoun í. There is no corresponding indirect
question of Cost formed with Equational Identity.","[415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422]"

Synthetic compounds of a distinct structural type form by lexicalizing an entire
clause. Lexemes of this nature are formed from verb or copular clauses or pronominally headed relative clauses. There are three classes.
One lexeme class involves a copula (COP) predicate and accompanying pre- and
post-copula nominals of identical phonological shape. Equational Identity copula
khi ‘be equivalent,’ pre- and post-copula position nominals, and Identity subject í
frame lexemes denoting indefinite, generic reference. They have the meaning ‘condition characterized by NOUN COP NOUN.’
émìíkhèmí ‘anything, whatever’
émì ‘thing,’ í ID, khi COP, émì ‘thing’
éghèíkhèghé ‘any time, whenever’
éghè ‘time,’ í ID, khi COP, éghè ‘time’
édèíkhèdé ‘whichever day, any day’
édè ‘day,’ í ID, khi COP, édè ‘day’
Lexemes of a second class denote a bodily condition. They employ the verb vbi
‘happen to’ preceded by the nonhuman noun émì and followed by the human noun
ómò. Resulting lexemes have the idiomatic interpretation ‘bodily condition characterized by NOUN VERB NOUN.’Classificatory synthetic compounds | 77émívbómò ‘convulsion’
émì ‘thing,’ vbi ‘happen to,’ ómò ‘child’
Synthetic compounds of a third class denote social roles deemed insulting.
These compounds are derived from relative clauses headed by relative pronoun
ólì/ónì. Lexemes of this nature have the interpretation ‘condition characterized by
PRONOUN NOUN VERB.’ The verb ne ‘pass’ used in some of these expressions derives from the neighboring Ora vernacular, as does the relative pronoun shape ónì.
ònìhóònè ‘one who farts’
ónì ‘one,’ ìhòn ‘fart,’ ne ‘to pass’
ònìsóònè ‘person defecating willy-nilly’
ónì ‘one,’ ìsón ‘feces,’ ne ‘to pass’
ònìvàngúé ‘shaggy rat’
ónì ‘one,’ ìvàn ‘grass cutter,’ gue ‘to nibble’
òlèkhòíò ‘shameless person’
ólì ‘one,’ èkhòì ‘shame,’ o ‘enter’2.5 Classificatory synthetic compounds
One type of synthetic compound serves to identify a referent with respect to its partitive character. Members exhibit a prefix+verb+noun morphological shape. Verbs in
partitive function synthetic compounds are sometimes difficult to identify synchronically. Today they occur as verbs with limited distribution or even as adverb or adjective forms that we assume derived historically from verbs.7 There are six synthetic
compound classes that bear on nominal classification.
One synthetic compound class is formed with prefix ú-/í-, a post-verb noun and
an elided form of the verb kpa ‘apportion, give equal amounts, divide’ (òjè kpá émà
ó vbì ìtásà [Oje PRP.apportion yam CL LOC bowl] ‘Oje apportioned yam into the
bowls’). kpa compound sense results from apportioning a nominal referent by isolating one part of its homogeneous mass or aggregate, any portion of which, when
isolated, is materially equivalent to any other portion.8 Lexemes in this class refer to
abstractions, locations (body part and otherwise), natural kinds and artifacts.
Abstraction:
úkpàtà ‘iota of truth’: àtà ‘truth’
úkpédè, í- ‘single day’: édè ‘day’
Body Part:
úkpédè, í- ‘strand of grey hair’: édè ‘grey hair’
úkpèrèè ‘drop of blood’: èrèè ‘blood’
úkpétò, í- ‘tuft of hair’: étò ‘hair’78 | Morphologyúkpéhìén, í- ‘fingernail, toenail’: éhìén ‘nail on the body’
Location:
úkpódè, í- ‘path, road’: ódè ‘way, pathway’
úkpòsé ‘bush path’: òsé ‘path’
Natural Kind:
úkpékèn ‘grain of sand’: èkèn ‘soil, sand’
úkpévbèè, í- ‘lobe of kola’: évbèè ‘kola’
úkpèvò ‘blade of thatch’: èvò ‘guinea grass for thatch’
úkpòhàà, í- ‘elephant grass blade’: òhàà ‘elephant grass’
úkpóràn ‘sapling, stalk’: óràn, éràn ‘tree’
úkpúgú'é ‘palm frond vein’: úgú'é, ígú'é ‘palm frond’
úkpáhíénhíén, í- ‘star’: áhíénhíén ‘star’
Artifact:
úkpóràn ‘stick, pole, club’: óràn ‘wood’
úkpìkhùnmì ‘tablet, small charm’: ìkhùnmì ‘charm, herb’
úkpébè, í- ‘sheet of paper’: ébè ‘paper, book’
úkpìsánó, í- ‘matchstick’: ìsánó ‘matches’
úkpótóòn, í- ‘rod of iron’: ótóòn ‘iron’
úkpòú, í- ‘strand of cotton, thread’: òú ‘cotton’
úkpúì, í- ‘piece of rope’: úì, íì ‘rope’
úkpémì, í- ‘bead’: émì ‘thing’
For some synthetic compounds with nouns of homogeneous mass, only the plural
prefix í- occurs. These compounds refer to abstractions, body parts, locations, natural entities, and artifacts.
Abstractions:
íkpìnyèmì ‘gossip’: ìnyèmì ‘issue, matter, discourse’
Body Parts:
íkpóòfò ‘prickly heat rash’: óòfò ‘sweat’
Locations:
íkpékò ‘spots in the market’: ékò ‘place, location in a market’
Natural Entities:
íkpèhìànmì ‘palm frond branches’: éhìànmì ‘peeling, peel’
íkpàtívbì ‘entangled vine-mass’: ívbìì ‘vines’
íkpésìrá ‘seeds of Piper gumensee’: ésìrá ‘Piper gumensee creeper’
íkpésè ‘clumps of gari or maize’: ésè ‘clump of pounded food item’
Artifact:
íkpàdè ‘retail items’: àdè ‘retail trade’Classificatory synthetic compounds | 79A second synthetic compound class consists of prefix ú-/í-, a post-verb noun
and the verb kpen ‘straighten’ (synchronically used only with the body-part noun
óbò/ábò ‘arm’ as direct object in a verb series construction with verb nyenye ‘push,
shove,’ e.g. yàn kpén ábó nyényé òjè [they PRP.straighten arms push Oje] ‘They
pushed Oje while straightening their arms / They shoved Oje with their arms’). Synthetic compounds with kpen have a sense in which a part results from a process of
straightening or stiffening a nominal referent. Process completion has the effect of
isolating a perceptually salient portion of a heterogeneous locus or aggregate, only
one portion of which is useable. Lexemes in this class refer to body-part locations,
natural kinds and artifacts.
Body Part:
úkpàgbàn ‘cleft of the chin’: àgbàn ‘chin’
úkpàkpó ‘part in the hair’: àkpó ‘path, track’
úkpátùí ‘anus proper’: átùí ‘anus area of the body’
úkpòè, íkpàwè ‘toe’: òè, àwè ‘foot, leg’
úkpóbò ‘finger’: óbò ‘hand’
úkpègèlè ‘penis’: ègèlè ‘pubic region’
úkpéhòn ‘earlobe’: éhòn ‘ear’
úkpùkhòìn ‘belly button’: ùkhòìn ‘navel and placenta’
úkpèò, í- ‘eyeball’: èò ‘eye, face’
úkpókòló, í- ‘larynx’: ókòló ‘esophagus, gullet’
úkpèvìè, í- ‘testicle’: èvìè ‘scrotum’
úkpùrìàì, í- ‘tip of animal tail’: ùrìàì ‘tail’
úkpèbì ‘gall bladder’: èbì ‘bile’
úkpètè ‘visible portion of a wound’: ètè ‘wound’
úkpé'túnù ‘lip’: únù ‘mouth’
úkpíká'n, í- ‘testicle’: íká'n ‘kidney’
úkpóènmì ‘tongue’: óènmì ‘tongue’
úkpófì, í- ‘yaws ulcer’: ófì ‘yaws, tropical skin disease’
úkpòísí' ‘deep boil in the flesh’: òísí' ‘gun’
úkpókòló, í- ‘larynx’: ókòló ‘esophagus, gullet’
úkpónwèé ‘phlegm’: ónwèé ‘cough’
úkpùrùn ‘distinct singing voice’: ùrùn ‘voice’
Natural Kind:
úkpàgbèdé ‘sprouting tip of grass’: àgbèdé ‘grass’
úkpókà, í- ‘kernel of maize’: ókà ‘maize’
úkpókhàì ‘lint from silk-cotton tree’: ókhàì ‘silk-cotton tree’
úkpéòn, í- ‘bee, honeybee’: éòn ‘honey’
úkpúgó', íkpígó' ‘gnat’: úgó', ígó' ‘bug’
úkpàsánmùghòìn ‘whipping cane’: ùghòìn ‘yellow-flowered shrub’80 | Morphologyúkpòwò, í- ‘rafter pole’: òwò ‘raffia palm tree’
Artifact:
úkpègúé ‘hoe tip’: ègúé ‘hoe’
úkpògán ‘tip of a spear’: ògán ‘spear’
úkpópìà ‘point of cutlass’: ópìà ‘cutlass, machete’
úkpùhàì, íkpíhàì ‘point of an arrow’: ùhàì, ìhàì ‘arrow’
úkpégàá ‘water channel joint’: égàá ‘water channel’
Synthetic compounds of a third class consist of prefix ú-/í-, a post-verb noun
and the verb so ‘achieve, make contact with an end point’ (òjè héén ólí ókòó só [Oje
PRP.climb the hill achieve] ‘Oje climbed the hill to its peak’). so occurs synchronically only in series with directional verbs to designate end point of a path of motion.9 Synthetic compounds with so have a sense that isolates the edible result of a
plant’s growth. Lexemes in this class refer to food items only.
Food:
úsúákògùè, í- ‘tuber of water yam’: ákògùè ‘water yam’
úsúémà, í- ‘tuber of yam’: émà ‘yam, raw or pounded’
úsùìbòbòdí, í- ‘tuber of cassava’: ìbòbòdí ‘cassava’
úsùògèdè, í- ‘plantain/banana finger’: ògèdè ‘plantain, banana’
úsúókà, í- ‘ear of maize’: ókà ‘maize’
úsùèkò, í- ‘ball of bean meal’: èkò ‘leaf wrap of beans’
A fourth synthetic compound class is fashioned by prefix á-, a post-verb noun
and verb buu ‘approach’ (ólí ékhìì búú ólì òkpòsò [the cripple PRP.approach the
woman] ‘The cripple approached the woman’). Post-verb nouns refer exclusively to
subinterval day-units. The entire compound denotes a transition into a temporal
period. These synthetic compounds thus refer to the onset of a subinterval day unit.
Time:
ábénwáà ‘dusk’: énwáà ‘evening’
ábódíánmì ‘early afternoon’: ódíánmì ‘afternoon’
Synthetic compounds in a fifth class are socially grounded. They are formed
with prefix ó-, a post-verb noun and verb kpo ‘visit frequently’ (òjè ó ò kpò vbí èvbò
[Oje SC H visit.frequently LOC there] ‘Oje frequents there’ / ‘Oje visits there frequently’). Morpheme kpo’s general sense ‘increase in size’ occurs in semantically related
adverbs: kpòí ‘swollen, plump’ and kpókó ‘swollen’. Synthetic compounds with kpo
isolate entities of a culturally awesome or powerful significance. Lexemes in this
class refer to natural kind, visual sensation, verbal expression and humans.","[99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]"
"Endnotes | 2878Deictic locative pronouns are also restricted by place nouns such as íráá ‘area,’ which accepts
attributive li complements. íráá takes èvbò and proximal èàn but not distal éàìn, proximal ààn or
distal áàìn.
íráá lì èàn
‘the area over here’
area R here
*íráá lì ààn ‘the area right here’
area R here

íráá lì èvbò [he PRP.be LOC area R there.yonder] ‘He was in the area yonder’) or transitive (ò yé íráá
lì èvbò [he PRP.move.to area R there.yonder] ‘He went to the area yonder’).
9In other constructions, the phonological shape khi designates right dislocation (ó gbé' ólí ófè, í khì
òlólò [he PAP.kill the rat ID be Ololo] ‘He killed the rat, that is Ololo’), the Equational Identity copula
khi (ólí ómóhé nà lí í khì ònwìmè [the man this PF ID be farmer] ‘It is this man who is a farmer’) or
indicative S-complement (òjè é óí khí ólì òkpòsò gbé ólí ófè [Oje PRP.tell him IND the woman PRP.kill
the rat] ‘Oje told him that the woman killed the rat’). It is only with its right dislocation and Equational Identity functions that Correlative Conjunction khi shares tonal patterning.
10The plural pronoun but singular reference constraint on pre-bíì position is maintained when the
collective preverb gba ‘together’ occurs in the matrix clause (mà / vbà / yàn bíì òjè gbá yé ímè [we
you they COM Oje PRP.COL move.to farm] ‘I / You / He and Oje together went to the farm’). Emphasizing further the singular reference of the pre bíì pronoun, one cannot use plural pronoun ma ‘we’
in construction with òjè, or even the third person direct object pronoun óì ‘he, she,’ to mean three
participants as in ‘we and Oje.’ It is thus also the case that post-bíì position takes a pronoun (mà bíì
óì gá ólì òkpòsò zé [we COM he PRP.meet the woman] ‘He and I met the woman’).

Emai noun phrases show two conjunction types. The Comitative morpheme bíì conjoins noun phrases. It induces high tone lowering at the left edge of its following
constituent, provided a high high sequence exists, and its final vowel elides. On the
other hand, Correlative conjunction khi precedes each correlated noun phrase.9 Its
final vowel elides and it induces high tone spread in its immediately following noun
phrase as well as high tone lowering at the left edge of each correlated noun phrase.

Comitative (COM) bíì restricts the grammatical properties of conjoined noun
phrases. Lexically headed noun phrases joined by bíì are limited by grammatical
number, animacy, syntactic shape, case and discourse features, while pronominally
headed noun phrases are even more restricted.
Comitative bíì conjoins two or more lexical noun phrases, although each noun
phrase beyond two requires an instance of bíì.

In matrix clauses following discourse-defined positions, bíì phrase positions differentially restrain pronominal anaphors. Post-bíì anaphors (óí) are obligatory when
co-referring to a noun phrase in focus, topic or antitopic position. Under these conditions, a zero pronoun is unacceptable.

Noun phrases linked by Comitative bíì restrict agreement regarding animacy,
syntactic shape, and grammatical number. Comitative bíì links names (òlólò bíì òjè
‘Ololo and Oje’), modified nouns (ólí éwè bíì ólí ófè ‘the goat and the rat’) or unmodified nouns (éwè bíì ófè ‘a goat and a rat’). Comitative bíì links names with modified
nouns (òjè bíì ómóó óí lí ó gbé' ófè [Oje COM friend his R he PAP.kill rat] ‘Oje and his
friend who killed a rat’). Regarding animacy, bíì conjoins animate nouns (ólí éwè bíì
ólí ófè ‘the goat and the rat’) or inanimate nouns (ólí úkpùn bíì ólì òkpàn ‘The cloth
and the gourd’), although human nouns tend to precede nonhuman animate nouns
(ólì òkpòsò bíì ólí áwà ‘the woman and the dog,’ *ólí áwà bíì ólì òkpòsò). However,
Comitative bíì does not conjoin animate and inanimate nouns (*ólì òkpòsò bíì ólí
úkpùn ‘the woman and the cloth’).
Grammatical number constrains the assignment of pronouns to bíì positions.
Pre-bíì position employs a plural pronoun reflecting the bíì phrase grammatical
relation, although English translation retains a singular or plural interpretation.
Post-bíì position employs an accusative pronoun, irrespective of bíì phrase grammatical relation.
With a bíì phrase as grammatical subject, pre-bíì position takes a plural nominative pronoun even when the referent is singular.10 Singular nominative pronouns
(e.g. ì ‘I’) are ungrammatical (*ì bíì òjè ‘I and Oje’).
(111) mà / vbà / yàn bíì òjè gá
ólì òkpòsò zé.
we you they COM Oje PRP.meet the woman
‘I / You / He and Oje met the woman.’
With a bíì phrase as direct object, pre-bíì position requires a plural accusative pronoun. The singular direct object form (e.g. mè) is ungrammatical (*mè bíì òjè ‘me
with Oje’).","[300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306]"

is the case in simple topic constructions.

They assign a referent to a nominal class. Canonical CMB constructions define two
noun phrase positions: the assigned nominal precedes the class nominal with the
copula interposed. The overall syntactic shape of CMB constructions is constrained,
particularly with respect to noun phrase composition and copula verbal properties.","[457, 458]"

locative preposition vbi (òjè shóó vbí úkpódé ré [Oje PRP.exit LOC road arrive] ‘Oje exited the road’).
18A ‘bring’ sense also arises in complex predicates where manipulative verbs combine with a deictic

"22 | MorphologyTab. 3: Alignment of semantic classes human, animate, inanimate, body-part (b-p) locus and abstract relative to Emai vowel alternations expressing grammatical genders.humananimateinanimateb-p locusabstracta- ~ e--++--a- ~ i-+++--e- ~ i--+---e- ~ e--+---o- ~ a----+-o- ~ e-++++-o- ~ i-++---o- ~ e-++--+o- ~ e-----+o- ~ i-+----u- ~ i--++++Each Emai prefix pair (i.e. gender) correlates to some extent with semantic entities that fall within the classes human, animate, inanimate, abstract and/or locus.
Based on their semantic profiles, few remnant genders reflect a single identifiable
semantic class. Of Emai’s 11 genders, all with mid back vowels designating singular
(i.e. o- ~ i-, o- ~ e-, o- ~ e-, o- ~ i-) exhibit human nouns except o- ~ a-; it shows bodypart items. The gender u- ~ i- is the most clearly non-human, since it reveals all classes except human. For the most part, common nouns for flora and fauna in these
gender classes reflect a generic or basic level of abstraction. Several classes identifying fauna, moreover, identify entities reflective of a pastoral lifestyle (e.g. sheep,
cow and goat), despite the fact that such a lifestyle is incompatible with the current
ecological environment of the Emai. In addition, Emai gender classes tend not to
include root forms that reflect an agricultural lifestyle (e.g yam, maize and beans).
An overall impression of Emai gender is available in Table 3, which pairs the 11 genders with each of five semantic classes.
Based on Table 3 and the list of noun forms in each gender, we identify the semantic character of Emai gender classes. The a- ~ e- gender incorporates animate
and inanimate entities: ákhè, ékhè ‘ceramic pot,’ áwà, éwà ‘dog.’ The a- ~ i- gender
subsumes human, animate and inanimate roots with recognizeable social values.
This gender applies to humans denoting lifecycle stages, birds at both the unique
beginner and mid taxonomic levels and an inanimate stem involving a complex
word form whose derivational history is no longer transparent: ágèlè, ígèlè ‘pubescent boy’, àlèkè, ìlèkè ‘pubescent female,’ áfìánmì, ífìánmì ‘bird,’ ávbé'ì, ívbé'ì ‘village weaver bird,’ ágádágòdò, ìgádágòdò ‘padlock.’Inflectional morphology | 23Two genders are each limited to a single root denoting a domesticated animal
type. In the e- ~ i- gender there is émèlá, ímèlá ‘cow’. And the e- ~ e- gender has one
root: éwè, éwè ‘goat.’
Body part extremities are identified by the o- ~ a- gender: óbò, ábò ‘hand, foreleg,’ òè, àwè ‘foot, hind leg.’ The o- ~ e- gender includes human, animate, inanimate
and locus noun roots. It has roots for mid level rodent, unique beginner and socially
recognized humans as well as roots for inanimates, tree and calabash bowl, as well
as an animal body-part extremity: ófè, éfè ‘rodent, rat,’ ótù, étù ‘person, people,’
óìbó, éìbó ‘whiteman,’ óràn, éràn ‘tree, wood, stick,’ òkpàn, èkpàn ‘calabash bowl,’
óhìà, éhìà ‘hoof, claw.’ Limited to roots denoting animate nouns and socially recognized humans is the o- ~ i- gender. It includes root forms for animals that are wild
(bush) or domesticated, for the human female, offspring and blood relative, and for
social roles antagonistic to societal welfare or reflective of traditional Emai occupations: óvbèè, ívbèè ‘monkey,’ óghòóghò, íghòóghò ‘female sheep,’ òkpòsò, ìkpòsò
‘woman, female,’ ómìòò, ímìòò ‘blood relative,’ òrúán, ìrúán ‘in-law,’ óghìàn, íghìàn
‘enemy,’ óhùà, íhùà ‘hunter.’
The o- ~ e- gender prefixes attach primarily to human root forms, marriage
roles, socially defined positions at the fringe of human society, animate roots for
domestic fowl as well as insects and an abstract root with negative value: ódòn,
édòn ‘husband,’ óhà, éhà ‘wife,’ óìà, éèà ‘person, human being,’ ómèmè, émèmè
‘lunatic, madman,’ ódíòn, édíòn ‘elder,’ óbò, ébò ‘oraclist, diviner,’ òkhòì, èkhòì
‘worm,’ óókhò, éókhò ‘fowl, hen,’ òbè, èbè ‘bad, evil.’ A single abstract root with
positive value denotation defines o- ~ e-: òsèn, èsèn ‘goodness, good.’ In the o- ~ igender one finds roots identifying human social roles in addition to affixal forms
reflecting nominalization (prefix added to a verb root) and synthetic compounds
(prefix added to verb plus noun). This gender also has root forms denoting male and
female humans in various life cycle stages as well as social roles and occupations:
òmòhè, ìmòhè ‘man,’ óvbèkhàn, ívbèkhàn ‘unmarried youth,’ òvíén, ìvíén ‘slave,
bonded one,’ òíé'n, ìíé'n ‘co-wife, female rival, ómòò, ímòò ‘friend, companion,’
ògbàmá , ìgbàmá ‘post pubescent male,’ óèjè, íèjè ‘chief, titled man,’ ózèwàìn,
ízèwàìn ‘wiseman, advisor, sage,’ ònwìmè, ìnwìmè ‘farmer,’ òlìmè, ìlìmè ‘farmer,’
òzètò, ìzètò ‘barber,’ óhànèvbòò, íhànèvbòò ‘judge,mediator’, ódùèkìn, ídùèkìn ‘merchant, trader,’ òvìnèbè, ìvìnèbè ‘scribe, writer,’ òdènyò, ìdènyò ‘drunkard,’ òyèhón,
ìyèhón ‘deaf person,’ òrùènó, ìrùènó ‘blind person,’ óré', íré' ‘stranger, visitor.’
The u- ~ i- gender hosts the largest number of noun roots. This gender incorporates primarily inanimate and animate roots with some from body-part locus. It has
forms denoting animal body parts, insects, artifacts and an abstract noun recognizing a basic temporal distinction: ùbèlè, ìbèlè ‘calabash, gourd,’ úgbàn, ígbàn ‘blade
of grass,’ úgùà, ígùà ‘bone joint,’ úkpàsánmì, íkpàsánmì ‘cane,’ úkpà, íkpà ‘seed,’

Within Emai’s grammatical system, agreement or concord linked to gender is no
longer functional. Perfect aspect and prospective aspect evince no morphological
agreement marking. However, a remnant agreement system is evident in imperfect
aspect, where continuous and habitual morphemes are distinguished by tone.
Continuous aspect in the third person is expressed by high tone ó, preceded
immediately by a low tone subject concord (SC) marker (ò) and a lexically headed
subject constituent with low tone at its right edge (ólí ómòhè, élí ímóhè).
(1) ólí ómòhè / élí ímóhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
the man
the men SC C eat the food
‘The man is / The men are eating food.’
Habitual is similarly framed except for tone, which in third peson is conveyed
by low tone ò preceded by a subject concord marker with high tone (ó) and a lexically headed constituent with right edge high tone (ólí ókpósó ná, élí íkpósó ná).
(2) ólí ókpósó ná / élí íkpósó ná
ó ò shèn úkpùn.
the woman this the women these SC H sell cloth
‘This woman sells / These women sell cloth.’
As clausal expressions in the imperfect illustrate, neither number nor gender
impacts shape of the agreement marker. There is no effect on subject concord phonological shape by indexing of grammatical number in the subject constituent (predeterminer ólí ~ élí with o- ~ e-) or by gender contrast of lexical head nouns
(ókpósó/íkpósó with o- ~ i- or ómòhè/ímóhè with o- ~ i-). Number and gender distinctions in agreement marking are thus neutralized.
Remnant agreement is evident within noun phrases, where a select group of adjectives must agree in number with their head noun. Emai attributive phrases
marked by the particle li index grammatical number on adjective forms
(òkhúá/èkhúá, óbín'/ébín') that modify gender bearing nouns. Hence, the grammatical number conveyed by the initial vowel of an attributive adjective (o- for singular
and e- for plural) varies in agreement with grammatical number of the initial vowel
of the head noun (e- for singular and i- or e- for plural).","[47, 48, 49, 50]"

In contrast to the pattern in bíì phrases, the left stem in phrasal compound lexemes
does not show high tone spread and the initial vowel of the right stem raises to high.
Phrasal compound lexemes of this type denote an object of traditional religious
belief or an abstract condition of elevated status. Only phonologically identical

Synthetic compounds in Emai consist of a prefix, a transitive verb root and either a
noun or adverb stem. Prefixes in synthetic compounds are a-, i-, e-, o-, o-, and u-;
only e- does not appear.
Synthetic compound lexemes with a verb and noun stem refer to household artifacts, natural world entities, social roles, locations and time conditions. Their interpretation reflects the relations ‘characterized by,’ ‘results from,’ or ‘used to undertake.’ In corresponding syntactic phrases, the noun stem corresponds to a direct
object argument of the transitive verb
Prefix a- converts transitive stative verbs or change of state verbs and their direct objects to location nominals denoting place. Resulting lexemes have the interpretation ‘spatial location characterized by VERB NOUN’ or an idiomatic variant of
this.

Complex synthetic compounds consist of a prefix, two verb roots and a single noun
stem. They exhibit structural subclasses based on noun position. Verb and noun
elements forming complex synthetic compounds correspond to verb phrase syntactic constituents. Prefixes in complex synthetic compounds include i-, o- and a-.
Complex synthetic compound lexemes of one structural type consist of two verb
roots with an intervening noun stem. The two verbs encode a complex predicate of
event end state or result, with the noun serving as predication direct object. These
lexemes encode relatively few entities, covering selected food items, games, social
roles, and abstract conditions.
Prefix i- converts end state verbs in series and their direct objects to patient
nominals denoting human social conditions. These lexemes have the interpretation
‘social condition characterized by VERB NOUN VERB.’

Complex synthetic compounds of a different structural character consist of a prefix,
verb root and an adverb or adverb derived from a verb. Predominantly intransitive
verbs are involved.
Lexemes of one structural type show a prefix, an intransitive verb and an adverb. They form with one prefix, i-, which converts intransitive stative verbs and
their adverbs to agent nominals denoting human social roles. Members have the
idiomatic sense ‘one characterized by VERB ADVERB.’
ìfòfòséén ‘dullard’

in this subclass encode social roles and abstract conditions. They show the prefixes
a-, o-, and o-.
Prefix a- converts intransitive activity verbs and their verbal adverbials to patient nominals denoting human social roles. Resulting lexemes have the interpretation ‘one characterized by VERB ADVERB.’

Synthetic compounds of a distinct structural character form with prefix, verb root
and postverbal particle. Particles included are Change of State (CS) a, Change of
Location (CL) o, and Applicative (APP) Change of Possession li/ni. Resulting lexemes
encode conditions or entities that assume change of some sort. Not participating in
synthetic compounds are the postverbal particles for Temporal Perspective (lee) and
Projected Adherence (e). Particle compound prefixes are i-, o-, e- and a-.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"

In subject position, logophoric pronouns for third person singular (e.g. yon) contrast
with corresponding personal pronouns for third person singular (e.g o). In embedded clauses, personal pronouns impose a disjoint, switch reference condition relative to their antecedent. Logophoric pronouns require conjoint reference, i.e. referential identity.

Gerundive nominalization employs circumfix ú-VERB-mi with alternating H L tone
across the word. Both transitive and intransitive verbs occur as ú-mi gerundives.
The ú-mi circumfix attaches to activity, change of state and stative verbs with
differential semantic effect. It converts intransitive and transitive activity verbs to
nominals denoting actions with the sense ‘human activity characterized by VERB.’

verbs that assume a gerundive shape follow their direct object arguments. The direct
object never follows the gerund (*úèmí éhéén ‘eating fish’).","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]"
"11A note on adverb order concerns the simile phrase marked by bi. It manifests highly restricted
distribution relative to all adverb classes except ideophones. Simile exponents follow but do not
precede Manner ideophones (kpèkèkpèkè, nyágányágá, bìbìbíbí).

13Although verb complement particles (Change of State a, Change of Location o, Applicative li/ni
and Temporal Perspective lee) also appear in postverbal position, they tend to precede adverbs,
except in the case of Temporal Perspective, which precedes or follows a Place adverb. Temporal
Perspective lee co-occurs with Frequency, Place and Deixis, but never with Manner, Mannerdemonstrative or Extent.
Temporal Perspective lee precedes but does not follow adverbs of Temporal Deixis (òdè) and
Frequency (èdèdé, ìsòkpá, édèédè).

Noncanonical constructions in Emai express the information status of a clause or
clause constituent in discourse. Discourse-defined constructions include positive
focus (PF) and negative focus (NF), topicalization, antitopic or right dislocation,
information questions, sentence affirmation (SA) and sentence negation (SN). Each
construction is morphosyntactically marked except topicalization, where intonation
downturn follows the topic constituent. Except for sentence affirmation and sentence negation, each construction is characterized by an additional constituent that
precedes or follows its matrix clause. The resulting discourse position, typically a
noun phrase, corresponds to a matrix clause grammatical relation. Each construction also co-occurs with at least one other construction type, although distinct constructions never affect the same matrix clause constituent.

Focus constructions assume a contrast between speaker and hearer knowledge
regarding the information status of a nominal referent or predicate event. Construc-348 | Noncanonical constructionstion purpose is to align hearer and speaker knowledge. Focus position in this construction expresses information that is not shared by speaker and hearer. Its following matrix clause conveys shared information.
Focus position is marked in affirmative structures by the morpheme li/ni and in
negative structures by ki. Focus position immediately precedes a matrix clause and
its constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in the matrix clause. For example, the focus position constituent ólí émà followed by li/ni or ki corresponds to
the direct object relation following the matrix verb shen. Focus position noun
phrases manifest an unmarked tone pattern, i.e. they accept a right edge low tone.
On the other hand, focus construction matrix clauses inflect for a limited range of
aspects, all with a right edge high tone subject.

‘It was the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
b. ólí émà kí ólí ómóhé ló

the yam NF the man PRED sell tomorrow
‘It wasn't the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
Across affirmative and negative focus types, only positive focus allows omission of
the construction marker. When li/ni is omitted, vowel elision does not affect phonological shape of either focus noun phrase (ólí émà) or matrix clause initial constituent (ólí ómóhé).

Focus constructions show variable grammatical marking of the matrix clause position corresponding to a focus constituent. They also limit nominal structure types in
focus position. As well, they constrain marking of their matrix clause as to inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs.
Focus constructions mark the matrix grammatical relation corresponding to a
focus constitutent with one of three strategies. The first of these affects matrix subject, possessor or first object in a double object complement. Each shows a pronoun
corresponding to the focus position constituent. A positive or negative focus position noun phrase (ólí ómòhè) corresponds to a third person singular pronoun (o ‘he’)
in matrix subject position.","[369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374]"
"‘have’ verb | 501As bi complement, some impersonal pronouns are allowed.24 Included are

èvá, collective èvèvá).
Noun phrase positions framed by ree bi restrict discourse repositioning of constituents. Subject fails to correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent or

The verb moe ‘have’ articulates relations of possession, either alienable or inalienable. It also translates English ‘own’ and ‘belong to.’25 Canonical moe constructions
frame two noun phrase positions and associated semantic roles: subject possessor
and direct object possessum. These constructions are limited as to overall syntactic
shape, including noun phrase exponents and verbal properties.

expressed with moe.

the table table PRP.have stain
‘The table / A table has a stain.’
b. *ólí áwà / *áwà mòè
émàè.
the dog dog PRP.have food
‘The dog has food.’
Constructions with moe restrict mood but not polarity. They appear as negative
statements (ólí ómòhè í ì mòè úkpùn [the man SC NEG have cloth] ‘The man does not
have cloth’) and polar questions (ólí ómòhè mòè ólí úkpùn? [the man PRP.have the
cloth] ‘Does the man have the cloth of a particular type?’). However, they fail as
imperatives and prohibitives.
Noun phrase positions in canonical moe constructions differentially constrain
NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. They also accept distinct sets of nouns, pronouns and modifiers. The noun phrase position preceding moe allows nominative
pronouns, regardless of person or number. It rejects indefinite subject pronoun a.

gbo occurs with temporal, subject attributive and quantity exponents to reveal the
emphatic schema EVAL / MD gbo Q / SA / TEMP gbo V. gbo appears with quantity
preverbs Emphatic Reflexive dobo and Absolute Intensifier zemi. With each, a copy
of gbo precedes the quantity preverb as well as the verb.

A similar distribution appears in emphatic constructions with subject attributives. A

the man PAP.ADD carefully ADD eat food

Relative to the temporal class in emphatic frames, gbo appears with tua. Their order
is again consistent with quantity and subject attributives: a copy of gbo precedes tua
and the verb. Neither remaining preverb class, evaluative or manner-demonstrative,
appears in gbo emphatic constructions.

the man PAP.ADD hurriedly ADD eat food
‘The man really ate the food in a hurry.’3.2.8.4 Complex emphatic constructions
A still more complex pattern of emphatic iteration occurs in constructions featuring
gbo and ìyó as well as subject attributive and quantity preverbs. In nonemphatic
frames, a single instance of gbo, following Resultative auxiliary za, precedes manner-demonstrative ìyó, subject attributive dégbe and quantity dobo. gbo never precedes Resultative za in these constructions.

frames employing multiple preverb classes show gbo only in its leftmost preverb
position. Again, temporal and evaluative do not factor in nonemphatic complex
multi-preverb constructions.
Evaluative and temporal aside, complex emphatic frames show one or more
copies of gbo marking each affected class across the preverb phrase. In one construction gbo precedes the verb, quantity dobo, subject attributive dégbe and manner-demonstrative ìyó.

Oje PAP.ADD DMD ADD carefully ADD REFL him eat the food
‘Oje really that way carefully ate the food by himself.’
In complex emphatic constructions, gbo behavior is consistent with the preverb
order schema: ASP EVAL TEMP MD SA Q. It is ungrammatical for gbo to precede ìyó
and the verb but not dégbe and dobo; precede dégbe and the verb but not dobo and
ìyó; precede ìyó and dobo but not dégbe and the verb; precede ìyó and dobo and the
verb but not dégbe; or precede ìyó, dégbe and the verb but not dobó.
The distribution facts concerning gbo further refine precedence relations among
preverbs. No two instances of gbo can be separated by a preverb category not164 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsmarked by gbo and no three instances of gbo can be separated by a preverb category
not marked by gbo. These adjacency relationships in conjunction with preverb cooccurrence constraints and constraints operating within ìyó emphatic constructions
shape Emai’s preverb schema.","[187, 188, 189, 190]"
"4.3.3.3.1
Marked attributive li
Attributive li complements attract adjective, noun, and nominalized verb exponents.
Each complement type reveals further differentiation and limitations. The position
following li limits syntactic elaboration. It disallows the definite article as physical
property noun modifier.
*émá lí ólì òbàn
*éwé lí ólí óbín'
yam R the raw/uncooked/unripe goat R the dark
‘the uncooked yam’
‘the dark goat’
li complement exponents do not accept postnominal modifiers either. When kindred
élìyó follows li and its complement, élìyó modifies the head noun, not the attributive
nominal.
àmágó lí óbán élìyó
mango R unripe that.kind
‘unripe mango of that kind’ / *‘mango that is that kind of unripe’
Attributive li complements permit adjectives for age, color, human propensity,
size, and physical property. Age adjectives complement human nouns and denote a
gradable or relative age/status (óvbékhán ‘youth,’ ómòò ‘friend’), not an nongradable property (*ómóhé lì kéré [male R younger] ‘younger male’; *ókpósó lì kéré [female

Attributive and quantitative contrast
Relator particle li controls a collective/distributive interpretation for some modifier
phrases. Affected are cardinal numeral and size adjectives, respectively. CollectiveDeterminers | 219interpretations require li and induce high tone spread on head noun.25 Distributive
interpretations disallow li and fail to induce high tone spread.
Cardinal numerals following a head noun reveal a distributive or collective interpretation depending on li occurrence. Numeral phrases marked by li express a
collective character. Absent li, cardinal numerals convey a distributive character.
Cardinal numeral phrases with a collective or distributive interpretation dependent
on occurrence or non-occurrence of li modify animate and inanimate nouns.

vines
R two
‘both intertwined vines, twosome’ímòhè èélé
men four

‘two vines’The collective/distributive interpretation of cardinal numerals arises with some
but not all place nouns. The noun ìwè ‘dwelling, house’ allows li and li-less complements, thus permitting a collective or distributive interpretation, respectively.
However, the related place noun óà ‘home, house’ rejects li marked cardinal numerals and thus only allows a distributive interpretation.

age.group R nine
‘entire 9th age grade / group’òtú
ìsín

‘nine age groups’Interpretations similarly controlled by Relator li are evident with the adjectives
kéré and kísín. When a li complement, these forms attribute physical size, inducing
high tone spread on the head noun. In the absence of li but still serving as a modifier, kéré and kísín express quantification or amount, failing also to induce high tone
spread on their head noun. Either attribution with li or quantification without li
applies to inanimate count nouns not marked inflectionally for number.","[240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245]"

As a brief addendum, verbs of human sensory experience convey immediate perception through
two complement strategies. Their impression role can be realized as S-complement or lexical NP
complement of a simple or complex predicate. Complement differences aside, each immediate
sensory experience construction requires a first person matrix subject and Continuous aspect.(i) a. ì á hón khí ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó vìé.
I C hear IND the youth
SC C cry
‘I hear the youth crying.’
b. ì á záwó khí ólí óvbèkhàn khì ò ó vìé.

IND he C cry
‘I see that as for the youth, he is crying.’

d. ì á rè óbó sò
ópìà.
I C take hand contact cutlass
‘I am touching the cutlass.’
e. ì á yàà íìghòn.
I C smell smoke
‘I am smelling smoke.’
To convey ongoing perception by third person subject, each verb except hon and zawo requires
imperfect aspect, typically the Continuous.
(ii) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó rè ómí fèè únú
ghòó.

18zawo appears to be a complex morphological form originally composed of za and ghoo, the former
being the epistemic Deductive auxiliary and the latter the predicate for ‘perceive.’14 Multi-clause constructions
Multi-clause constructions in Emai subordinate one clause to another or conjoin two
or more independent clauses. Emai conjunction shows distinct contrastive and disjunctive forms. Of these, disjunction is the more syntactically restricted. In addition,
separate contrastive forms exist for sentences and S-Complements. There is no form
for clause conjunction.
To express subordination, Emai relies on grammatical category types that include verbs, auxiliaries, nouns and complementizers. These grammatical resources
are not uniformly distributed across subordinate clause types of the sort identified
in Shopen (1985), aligning as indicated in Table 7.
Tab. 7: Alignment of subordination marker type (AUX=auxiliary,COMP=complementizer, VERB,
NOUN) with notional semantic clause type.","[897, 898, 899, 900]"

Past perfect (PAP) specifies a distal or nonimmediate past relation between event
time and utterance time. It carries no implication of present relevance, appearing
instead to ascribe definite or emphatic character to a past event. In monotransitive
constructions inflected for PAP, verb tone is high downstep and subject phrase tone
is either high on a pronoun (ó) or right edge high on a lexically headed constituent
(ólí ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná).

‘The man / This man ate the food.’
Past and Present perfect show contrasting temporal adverbs. Past perfect takes òdè
‘yesterday,’ while Present perfect accepts èghéènà ‘just recently.’ Reversal of alignment between adverbs and perfect type is ungrammatical.
(3) a. ójé nwú'

‘Oje has given yam to the woman just recently.’
Imperfect aspect views an event as incomplete relative to moment of utterance
or reference time. For Continuous, some temporal portion of an event is coincident
with moment of utterance. This is not necessarily the case for Habitual, where an
event is not indexed to a specific point on the time line. Each imperfect is designated
by a tonal pattern affecting subject phrase and verb phrase. In monotransitive structures, verb tone is low but subject phrase tone varies according to imperfect type.
Continuous aspect specifies the ongoing character of an event relative to moment of utterance or reference time. In monotransitive clauses with third person
subjects, Continuous is expressed by high tone ó, verb tone is low (è) and subject102 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsphrase exhibits a low tone pronoun (ò) or low tone subject concord (ò) following a
lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).

b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà ò ó è ólí émàè.
the man
the man this SC C eat the food
‘The man / This man is eating food.’
Habitual denotes the timeless character of an event, delinking it from time axis
points. In monotransitive clauses with third person subjects, Habitual is low tone ò,
verb tone is low (shèn) and subject phrase shows a high tone pronoun (ó) or subject
concord with high tone (ó) following a lexical constituent with right edge high (ólí
ómóhé, élí ímóhé ná).
(5) a. ó ò shèn úkpùn.
he H sell cloth
‘He sells cloth.’
b. ólí ómóhé / élí ímóhé ná
ó ò shèn úkpùn.
the man
the men these SC H sell cloth
‘The man sells / These men sell cloth.’
Imperfect Continuous and Habitual adopt adverbs with distinct temporal dimensions. Continuous allows adverbial ènyáà ‘just now,’ whereas Habitual accepts adverbials of frequency (sàá ‘always’) or indefinite past (éghèéghè ‘generations ago’).
Reversing this assignment is ungrammatical.
(6) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émáé ènyáà / *sàá.

‘The man is eating the food now.’
b. ólí ómóhé ó ò è émá sàá / *ènyáà.
the man SC H eat yam always just.now
‘The man always eats yam.’
In construction with syntactically nonelaborated subject and direct object phrases,
Habitual expresses generic statements.
(7) ívbékhán ó ò gbè àkàkà.
youth

‘Youngsters kill grasshoppers.’Inflectional and auxiliary categories | 103In imperfect aspect, subject concord conveys neither number nor class agreement
vis-à-vis its subject noun phrase. Concord form is constant across lexical subjects
that are singular/plural (ólí ómòhè ‘the man,’ élí ímòhè ‘the men’) and human/nonhuman (ólí ómòhè, ólì ògò ‘the bush’).
(8) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàè.

c. ólì ògò ò ó tòó.

‘The bush is burning.’
Prospective aspect, while specifying event nonoccurrence, recognizes a future
event with two degrees of remoteness: proximal and distal. It is expressed by high
tone ló and contrasting tonal patterns on the subject.
Predictive ló ‘will’ allows the speaker to claim that a future event will occur at a
point distal to reference time. In bare monotransitives inflected for Predictive, verb
tone is low (è) and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or right edge
high for a lexically headed constituent (ólí ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná).
(9) a. ó ló

‘He will eat the food.’
b. ólí ómóhé / ólí ómóhé ná ló
è ólí émàè.
the man
the man this PRED eat the food
‘The man / This man will eat the food.’
Anticipative ló reflects a speaker claim that an event will occur at a future point
proximal to reference time. It translates ‘about to.’ In bare monotransitives, verb
tone is low (è) and subject tone is low on a pronoun (ò) or right edge low for a lexical
constituent (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).
(10) a. ò ló

he ANTI eat the food

the man
the man this ANTI eat the food
‘The man / This man is about to eat the food.’104 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsProspective types accept distinct temporal adverbs. Predictive ló allows ákhò ‘tomorrow’ but not ènyáà ‘just now.’ Anticipative ló allows adverb ènyáà but not ákhò.
(11) a. ólí ómóhé ló
è ólí émáé ákhò / *ènyáà.
the man PRED eat the food tomorrow just.now
‘The man will eat the food tomorrow.’
b. ólí ómòhè ló
è ólí émáé ènyáà / *ákhò.
the man ANTI eat the food just.now tomorrow
‘The man is about to eat the food just now.’3.1.2 Predicate negation
Negative inflection is expressed by three mutually exclusive forms: Perfect ì, Prospective khà and Past Absolute yà. Each occurs with a subject pronoun or subject
concord í and a lexically headed subject phrase.
Perfect Negation (NEG) is expressed by low tone ì. In third person monotransitive clauses, verb tone is low (è), and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or subject concord high í follows a lexically headed constituent with right
edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).
(12) a. ó ì
è émàè.
he NEG eat food
‘He did not eat food.’
b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà í ì
è ólí émàè.
the man
the man this SC NEG eat the food
‘The man / This man is not eating the food.’
Phonological shape of the Perfect Negation morpheme is constant across nominative pronouns, except for second singular [ù], and restrictive third plural [è].
(13) a. í ì
/ ú ù / ó ì
è ólí émàè.
I NEG you NEG he NEG eat the food
‘I / You / He did not eat the food.’
b. má ì
/ vbá ì / yán ì
/ é
è
è ólí émàè.
we NEG you NEG they NEG they NEG eat the food
‘We / You / They / They did not eat the food.’
Negative inflection takes two other shapes, both referring to events temporally
removed from utterance time. Prospective Negation (PRONEG) codes events that
project to a point subsequent to time of utterance. It translates ‘will not’ and reliesInflectional and auxiliary categories | 105on low tone khà, which also expresses epistemic Hypothetical.1 In third person
monotransitive clauses, Prospective Negation verb tone is low (è) and subject
phrase tone is either high for a pronoun (ó) or subject concord high tone í follows a
lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).
(14) a. ó khà
è ólí émàè.

‘He will not eat the food.’
b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà í
khà
è ólí émàè.
the man
the man this SC PRONEG eat the food
‘The man / This man will not eat the food.’
Also removed from time of utterance is Past Absolute Negation (PANEG). It is signaled by low tone yà ‘never.’2 In third person monotransitives, verb tone is low
(shèn) and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or high tone subject
concord í follows a lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí
ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).
(15) a. ó yà
shèn úkpùn.
he PANEG sell cloth
‘He never sells cloth.’
b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà í yà
shèn úkpùn.
the man
the man this SC PANEG sell cloth
‘The man / This man never sells cloth.’
Negation of affirmative imperative commands is expressed by Prohibition constructions. The Prohibitive (PR) morpheme è exhibits low tone. It requires a second
person subject pronoun, either singular form é or plural vbá, both showing high
tone. In bare monotransitives, verb tone (é) is high.
(16) a. é è é ólí émàè.
you PR eat the food
‘Don't eat the food.’
b. vbá è é ólí émàè.
you PR eat the food
‘Don't eat the food.’106 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs3.1.3 Modality
Emai deontic and epistemic forms exhibit contrasting distribution and tonal patterns. There is one deontic form and six epistemic forms. Within and across modality types, auxiliaries combine. Deontic Hortative use assumes that an obligation
relation exists between grammatical subject and clausal event. Showing high tone í,
it induces left edge low tone of the immediately following constitutent. Epistemic
auxiliaries convey speaker judgment about degree of probability or certainty of
proposition truth value (Palmer 2001). Three judgment types occur: rational (Deductive za, Resultative za), speculative (Certaintive ma, Dubitative vba, Dubitative bia)
and assumptive (Concessive rere/re, Hypothetical kha). Epistemic forms fail to induce left edge low tone in a following constituent.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"

Complex predicates consisting of Change of State (CS) particle a or Change of Location (CL) particle o and either of the verbs fi or ku in series express meanings bearing
on object release. They convey change of spatial location that is projected (PCL) orProjected and extended change | 559extended (ECL), change of positional state that is extended (ECPS), change of material state that is extended (ECMS), or state change that is extended (ES). In each, the
subject or direct object referent releases through space, ballistically propelled by
force (PCL) or nonballistically extends through space in a continuous motion (ECL),
extends across a continuous space of change of state (ECPS/ECMS), or extends
across a state (ES). These are summarized in Table 5.
Tab. 5: Sample meanings and co-occurrence relations between representative verb types and morphemes marking bounded (fi o / ku o) and unbounded (fi a / ku a) projected change of location

Either it is bounded by an overt
reference point, and thus marked by fi / ku o and a following locative vbi phrase. Or
it is unbounded, and thus not overtly expressed, in which case it is marked by fi / ku
a. Choice of fi or ku reflects grammatical number of affected argument, fi for singular
and ku for plural/mass. ku often reflects a distributive sense characterized in English
translation by ‘throughout, all over’ or verbs such as ‘splash.’
Bounded and unbounded change predications occur with a variety of verbs in
series, in particular those expressing change of location or change of state. These
verbs assume intransitive or transitive shapes where they tend not to accept either
CL o or CS a in the absence of fi or ku. Distribution facts reveal five patterns for complex transitive predications of projected and extended change.","[581, 582, 583, 584, 585]"
"4.3.2.1 Demonstratives nà, áìn, nóì
Demonstratives consist of deictic and contrastive (nondeictic) members. Deictic
demonstratives consist of proximal nà ‘this/these’ and distal áìn ‘that/those.’ They
do not inflect for grammatical number. With human, nonhuman animate and inan-Determiners | 175imate nouns inflected for number, deictic demonstratives require the definite predeterminer, singular ólí or plural élí.

with count or mass nouns only when the definite predeterminer is absent (*ólí
ókpósó nóì). nóì is found with human (ókpósó), nonhuman animate (éwé) and inanimate (úkpún) nouns inflectionally marked for number, count (émá) and mass (ékén,

Kindred modifiers follow their head noun in a noun phrase, as do numerative, quantitative and demonstrative modifiers. Kindreds categorize a referent as to ‘kind’ on a
cluster of properties rather than a single property; they modify nouns that stratify
according to ‘kind of’ relations. Constraints on kindred modifier distribution reveal
classification along two lines: physical stratification according to a hierarchical
‘kind of’ taxonomy (e.g. PLANT, TREE, OAK, BURR OAK realizing unique beginner,
life form, generic, and specific forms, Berlin 1992, Foley 1997; or FURNITURE,
CHAIR, ROCKING CHAIR realizing superordinate, basic, subordinate forms, Rosch
1977) or social stratification according to family ~ non-family affiliation.
Deictic and contrastive kindred forms are distinguished by an older generation.
Younger speakers tend not to utilize the full range of deictic kindred forms. For older speakers, kindred root forms premit prefixes showing number: singular ó- and
plural é-. Relative distance to speaker is indicated by root contrast: proximal -nìná
and distal -lìyó, respectively.
ónìná ‘this kind’
ólìyó ‘that kind’énìná ‘these kind’
élìyó ‘those kind’Determiners | 177For younger speakers, only kindred élìyó is utilized. Its erstwhile deictic and number
values are neutralized, since it is employed for all ‘same kind’ kindred attribution.
For instance, élìyó occurs with singular and plural forms of common nouns.
úkpún élìyó
cloth that.kind
‘cloth of that kind’íkpún élìyó
cloths that.kind
‘cloths of that kind’A contrastive kindred meaning is expressed by root -dan. It denotes difference
in kind relative to a referent in the situational context. Its word initial prefix ó-/éalternates to express number.
ódàn ‘different kind sg’édàn ‘different kind pl’Given their prefixal expression of number, the contrastive kindred forms ódàn and
édàn differentially occur with count nouns inflectionally marked for number. Their
respective phrases require number agreement.
úkpún ódàn
cloth different.kind
‘cloth of a different kind’íkpún édàn
cloths different.kind
‘cloths of a different kind’Kindred modifiers, and by inference kindred forms of the earlier generation, restrict their distribution with noun lexemes. As one might expect, kindred forms fail
to occur with proper nouns of any kind. With common nouns, they co-occur with
referents reflecting the classes human (érá élìyó ‘father of that kind,’ ómó élìyó ‘infant of that kind’), animate (éwé élìyó ‘goat of that kind,’ óókhó élìyó ‘chicken of that
kind’), inanimate (ògbèdí élìyó ‘barrel of that kind,’ ákhé élìyó ‘ceramic pot of that
kind’), locus (íwé élìyó ‘house of that kind,’ àkpó élìyó ‘path of that kind’) and abstract
(ésón élìyó ‘poverty of that kind’). Nonetheless, there are limitations on élìyó and
ódàn/édàn distribution, some sharper than others.
Human and abstract nouns are constrained in their co-occurrence with kindred
modifiers. Most abstract nouns fail with élìyó or ódàn/édàn (*óbé élìyó ‘badness of
that kind,’ *éhíó élìyó ‘arrogance of that kind,’ *éhí élìyó ‘personal spirit/fate of that
kind,’ *édé élìyó ‘day of that kind’). Human nouns are constrained relative to social
roles outside the immediate family (*óróón élìyó ‘widow of that kind,’ *ágbédé élìyó
‘blacksmith of that kind,’ *ìyèhón élìyó ‘deaf persons of that kind’).
With animate and inanimate lexemes associated with flora and fauna, élìyó and
ódàn/édàn co-occurrence limitations reflect taxonomic structure. Unique beginner,
life-form and generic level terms (or superordinate and basic level terms) are acceptable (éhéén élìyó ‘fish of that kind,’ áfìánmí élìyó ‘bird of that kind,’ ényé élìyó178 | Noun modifiers‘snake of that kind,’ órán élìyó ‘tree of that kind’). Specific level or subordinate level
terms, however, are not (*áwàédà élìyó ‘dogfish of that kind,’ *àwàì élìyó ‘partridge
of that kind,’ *óvbìvbìé élìyó ‘black cobra snake of that kind,’ *ùlókò élìyó ‘iroko tree
[Chlorophora excelsa] of that kind’). Kindred qualities, be they physical or social/cultural, thus constrain nominal occurrence with Emai’s kindred modifiers.
As already noted, kindred élìyó co-occurs with count nouns (assuming appropriate stratification) that express number inflectionally. It also occurs with nouns
that do not express number by inflectional means.
émá élìyó
yam that.kind
‘yam of that kind’àgógó' élìyó

émá ódàn
yam different.kind
‘yam of a different kind’àgógó' édàn
gong different.kind
‘gongs of a different kind’Kindred forms occur with mass nouns that exhibit appropriate physical or social

ámé ‘water’ (*ámé élìyó ‘water of that kind’).
ékén élìyó

Modifiers that quantify a head noun show universal and existential subclasses
whose members are mutually exclusive. They also exhibit restrictions relative to
definite article, demonstratives and kindred forms. Only existential quantifiers mark
grammatical number inflectionally.
Existential quantifiers assert the existence of a referent known to the speaker
but not the hearer. They identify a referent from an assumed collective, as with contrastive root -vbèé, or simply isolate a referent, as with partitive root -sò. Existential
stems show prefixal number marking through singular ó- and plural é-.
ósò ‘certain / some’
óvbèé ‘another / other’ésò ‘certain / some’
évbèé ‘other’Existential quantifiers occur with animate or inanimate count nouns that mark
grammatical number inflectionally. Resulting phrases show number agreement.

and quantifies over the entire collective. òdóòdé ‘each’ also assumes a collective
aggregate but distributes its quantification over each member of the collective. Neither form inflectionally marks number. Each universal quantifier form appears with
count nouns inflectionally marked as plural. Neither quantifier appears with count
nouns inflected for singular (*éwé èrèmé ‘all goat,’ *óvbékhán òdóòdé ‘each youth’).

"9 Postverbal particles in complex predicates
Emai verb phrases show complex predicates framed by postverbal particles in construction with verb forms. Each verb-particle predication type is associated with
multiple semantic functions. Nonetheless, each in its principal function signals
either Change of Possession (Applicative, APP) li/ni, Change of Location (CL) o,
Change of State (CS) a, Projected Change of Location with Adherence (PAD) e, or
Temporal Perspective (TEMP) lee.

Two Emai particles specify event aspect (CS and TEMP), while three characterize
argument structure. Particle co-occurrence relates to function. Temporal Perspective
lee combines with each of the other particles. Change of State, Change of Location
and Projected Adherence are mutually exclusive. Change of State and Change of
Location each combine with Applicative li/ni, although not when the latter marks
Change of Possession recipient. Instead, li/ni in these constructions with CS a and
CL o codes a benefactive semantic role.

with its preceding verb depending on structural conditions. Moreover, particles
exhibit tone behavior distinct from adverbials, since they fail to induce high tone
spread at right edge of a preceding direct object constituent. No postverbal particle
serves as a simple predicate.
In this chapter as well as Chapters 10, 11 and 12 addressing other complex predications, we detail a range of structural properties for each predication type. These
include component verbs and related noun phrases as well as restrictions concerning inflectional aspect, polarity and mood, possible repositioning of arguments to
discourse prominent positions and predication response to aspectually sensitive
question types. The latter take the shape of discourse frames incorporating
émé'/émí' NP ú ‘What did someone do?’ and émé'/émí' ú ‘What happened?’.1

Complex predicates coded by postverbal Applicative (APP) li/ni and its nominal
complement express recipient or beneficiary relations conveyed in English by
‘to/for’ or ‘from.’ Component verbs are transitive or intransitive.
Applicative form varies according to its complement. Its li exponent occurs with
a lexical noun complement. The ni form appears with a pronoun complement or
when the Applicative is stranded in postverbal position, as in positive focus (PF)
constructions marked by li/ni.

which differ in phonological shape from accusative pronouns (e.g. óì ‘him’). Applicative li/ni does not accept place nouns (e.g. áfúzé' ‘Afuze’) or ellipted associative
phrases of place marked by ésì/ísì.

Recipient li/ni also co-occurs with transitive verbs of object manipulation, e.g. nwu
‘take hold’ and roo ‘pick up.’ Predication sense is ‘give.’ Independent of the li/ni
construction, manipulation verbs like nwu with only a direct object complement
convey the sense ‘carry,’ not ‘give.’

Complex predicates with li/ni recipients reveal additional properties when expressing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as
discourse repositioning of arguments. Recipient li/ni predications do not restrict
aspect. They inflect for Present perfect (right edge low tone subject phrase) and Past
perfect (right edge high tone subject phrase) as well as imperfect Continuous.

Complex li/ni predicates express a range of argument roles or functions in addition to recipient. These are beneficiary, aversive and addressee. Each is briefly illustrated below.
li/ni complements identify event beneficiary, an argument of the predication
that benefits in some way from an event (Blake 2001). Beneficiary functions occur
with simple predicates (hóó ‘wash) and complex predicates (nwú móé ‘hold’).","[542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547]"
"13.3.4 VP-complement logical subject and nominal modifiers
VP-complements, whose logical subject serves as direct object of the preceding
verb, share some restrictions with grammatical subjects of subjunctive li complements. Direct objects preceding VP-complements reveal a nonuniform acceptance of
nominal modifiers as well as pronominals.
Direct objects preceding VP-complements allow the definite article (ólí ómóhé
‘the man’).
(40) ólí ókpósó ré'
é ólí ómóhé gbè ólí ófè.
the woman PAP.CONC tell the man kill the rat
‘The woman then told the man to kill the rat.’812 | Embedded S- and VP-complementsThis same direct object position allows nouns modified by Associative ísì phrases
(òvíén ísì èmé ‘slave of mine’), Relator li phrases (ómóhé lí óbín' ‘the dark man’), and
li marked relative clauses (ómóhé lí ó dé' ólí úkpún ‘man who bought the cloth’).
Logical subjects of VP-complements permit all postdeterminers except kindred
forms. They do not admit élìyó and ódàn, since matrix verbs like e ‘tell’ require a
direct object noun that is human. Exemplars of demonstrative, quantifier and numeral classes occur as logical subjects for VP complements. Deictic demonstratives
appear with human nouns (ólí ómóhé ná / áín ‘this / that man’), as does contrastive
demonstrative nóì (ómóhé nóí ‘the next man’). Direct object position preceding VP
complements accepts quantifiers: collective universal èrèmé (ímóhé èrèmé ‘all the
men’), distributive universal òdóòdé (ímóhé èrèmé ‘each of the men’), partitive existential ósò (ómóhé ósò ‘a certain man’) and contrastive existential óvbèé (ómóhé
óvbèé ‘another man’). Logical subjects of VP-complements accept numeral
modifers, including collective (e.g. ímóhé èvèvá ‘both men’), ordinal (ómóhé lí ózèvà
‘a second man’) and cardinal forms, although cardinals must be identified as definite, for example by the definite predeterminer (e.g. élí ímòhè èvá ‘the two men’, ólí
ómòhè òkpá ‘the one man’).713.3.5 VP-complement logical subject and pronouns
VP-complement logical subjects (occupying direct object position governed by a
preceding verb) accept pronouns as a class. However, this position reveals some
retrictions regarding personal, indefinite, logophoric, partitive and impersonal pronouns.8 VP-complement logical subjects occur as accusative pronouns, regardless of
person or number.
(41) ólí ókpósó ré'
é
mé / wé / óí gbè ólí ófè.
the woman PAP.CONC tell me you him kill the rat
‘The woman then told me / you / him to kill the rat.’
VP complement logical subjects assume the shape of attributive phrase pronouns (ólí kéré ‘the small one’) and pronominally headed relative clauses with specific reference (ólí ó dé' émá ‘one who bought yam’).9 VP-complement logical subject
does not accept a logophoric pronoun in single complement structures.10
Logical subjects of VP-complements only limit impersonal kindred pronouns.
They prohibit élìyó and ódàn due to a conflict between their affinity for nonhuman
nouns and VP subcategorization for a human houn direct object, as with e ‘tell’.
Remaining impersonal classes, demonstrative, quantifier, and numeral, are not
similarly affected. VP-complement logical subjects allow contrastive demonstrative
ónóì ‘the next one’ and deictic demonstrative ónà or óáìn. They accept universalComplement type and verb type | 813quantifiers (distributive òdóòdé, collective èrèmé) and existential quantifiers (partitive ósó, contrastive óvbèé). Numeral pronouns as VP-complement subjects are
grammatical. Collective (e.g. èvèvá) and ordinal (e.g. ólí ózévá) are found, as are
cardinal numerals (e.g. èvá), although the latter again prefer a partitive phrase (èvá
vbí élí ímóhé ‘two of the men,’ úkpòkpá vbí élí ímóhé ‘one of the men’).

Although Emai complement types vary in their syntactic properties, they differ
along an additional dimension. Complement types do not distribute uniformly
across verb types, as revealed in Table 6.

indirect question (IQ), verb phrase (VP) and direct quote (DQ) according to verb cluster types speech

"Sentence focus | 407SA limits aspectualizers. Boundary forms as a class are precluded (Conative òó,
Ingressive ya, Egressive mo, Past Absolute ya and mo). Among acceptable phasal
aspectualizers are Repetitive che (érí' ólí ómóhé ché' hóó ólí úkpùn [SA the man

gbo (érí' ólí ómóhé gbó' hóó ólí úkpùn [SA the man PAP.ADD wash the cloth] ‘Indeed,

SA admits temporal preverbs tua (érí' ólí ómóhé túá' é ólí émà [SA the man
PAP.hurriedly eat the yam] ‘Indeed, the man hurriedly ate the yam’) and bobo (érí'
ólí ómóhé bó'bò é ólí émà [SA the man PAP.promptly eat the yam] ‘Indeed, the man
promptly ate the yam’). It rejects kpao.
In SA constructions, quantity preverbs except Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze are
allowed. One thus finds zemi (érí' ólí ómóhé zé'mì é ólí émàè [SA the man PAP.ABSI
eat the food] ‘Indeed, the man ate a lot of the food’), gba (érí' élí ímóhé gbá' é ólí

and dobo (érí' ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì é ólí émàè [SA the man PAP.REFL him eat the food]
‘Indeed, the man himself ate the food’).
Uniformly appearing in SA clauses are subject attributives dábo ‘deliberately,’
dóbo ‘mistakenly,’ dúda ‘defiantly,’ miti ‘able,’ gbúdu ‘courageously,’ dégbe ‘carefully,’ totóbo ‘intensely’ and kakégbe ‘perseveringly.’ Suggestive examples include
dóbo (érí' ólí ómóhé dó'bò gbé ólí ófè [SA the man PAP.mistakenly kill the rat] ‘Indeed the man mistakenly killed the rat’) and miti (érí' ólí ómóhé mí'tì gbé ólí ófè [SA

Relative clauses co-occur with demonstrative modifiers, although distinct order
patterns characterize deictic and contrastive forms. Deictic demonstratives, distal
áìn and proximal nà, follow a relative clause. They do not immediately follow the
head noun and precede the relative clause.

ólí ófè váré'.

Relative clauses are more constrained in combination with quantifiers and kindred
modifiers. Collective universal quantifier èrèmé follows the head noun and precedes
a li marked relative clause. The distributive universal quantifier òdóòdé fails to cooccur with a relative clause constituent.

Emai postdeterminer types display order relations relative to one another and to a
head noun (N). Six categories are evident: genitive (GEN), adjectival (ADJ), kindred
(KIND), number (NUM), relative clause (RC) and demonstrative (DEM). Relative to
one another, they most often exhibit behavior consistent with Schema A:
NGEN ADJ KIND NUM RC DEMA single NP headed by noun íkpùn ‘cloths’ illustrates this schema.
íkpún ísì ójé lí óbín' élìyó
èvá lí ónwímé shén-í'
áìn
cloths ASS Oje R dark that.kind two R farmer PAP.sell-F those
‘those two dark cloths of Oje's of that kind that the farmer sold’
Less extended nominal phrases further support relations within Schema A. Regarding modifier types most often identified in the literature (Greenberg’s 1966, Universal #20), the corresponding Emai categories show ADJ NUM DEM. Adjective, marked
by relator particle li, precedes cardinal numeral èvá ‘two’ and demonstrative áìn
‘that.’ Reversing the order is unacceptable.
éwé lí óbín' èvá áìn
goats R dark two those
‘those two dark goats’Determiners | 231Adjective with its li marking follows but does not precede the genitive, which is
marked by associative preposition ísì.
éwé ísì òí lí óbín'
goats ASS his R dark
‘his dark goats’
Number, e.g. èvá ‘two,’ precedes relative clause (lí ónwímé shén'-ì), which is marked
by relator particle li.
éwé èvá lí ónwímé shén'-ì
goats two R farmer PAP.sell-F
‘two goats that the farmer sold’
Deictic demonstrative (e.g. áìn), in contrast, follows li and relative clause.
éwé lí ónwímé shén-í'
áìn
goats R farmer PAP.sell-F those
‘those goats the farmer sold’
The remaining postnominal category, kindred (e.g. élìyó ‘that kind’), is positioned
between adjective and number. It follows li-coded adjective, but it precedes number.
òlógbó lí óbín' élìyó
cat
R dark that.kind
‘dark cat of that kind’éwé élìyó
èvá
goats that.kind two
‘two goats of that kind’Kindred élìyó also follows genitive (e.g. ísì ójé ‘of Oje’) but precedes relative clause
(e.g. lí ónwímé dé-ló'-ì ‘that the farmer bought’).
éwé ísì ójé élìyó
lí ónwímé dé-ló'-ì
goats ASS Oje that.kind R farmer PAP.buy-DS-F
‘Oje’s goats of that kind that the farmer bought’
With regard to Schema A’s broader character, relative clause and deictic demonstrative assume their respective positions on the right. The slot preceding relative clause
and following the head noun can be occupied by genitive, adjective, kindred or
number exponents. Reversing the order, e.g. deictic demonstrative preceding genitive or any of the others, is unacceptable.30232 | Noun modifierséwé ísì òí lí ónwímé shén-í'

never accepts a following expletive pronoun (*úgógó úvbí óì [remains.of DIM it] ‘broken remains of

pieces’ (ó dé ésèsèmì [it PRP.reach fragments] ‘It fragmented / is in a fragmented state / is wornEndnotes | 233out’), which in turn may be a gerundive form derived from the verb se ‘split’ (òjè sé òsé lágáá ímè
[Oje PRP.split path move.around farm] ‘Oje split a path around his farm’).
7There is no lexical source for úgógò, but oral narratives identify a mythic location úgò ‘Ugo.’8There is also a temporal predeterminer exclusively for temporal nouns (Chapter 6, 6.1.1).","[253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259]"
"2.1.1 Noun inflection
Emai evinces a remnant gender system of number bearing prefixes attached to nominal roots. Aspects of this system are also evident in prefixes attached to postnominal modifiers as well as pronouns expressing varying syntactic functions.
Number inflection determines the shape of some nominal and modifier stems.
For a limited set of nominal roots belonging to human, animate and inanimate classes as well as body-part locus and abstractions, a number contrast is marked by
vowel prefixes. There is a tendency for singular to be realized by back, mid vowels
(o- and o-) and plural by front, non-low vowels (i-, e-, e-). It is only the mid low vowel (a-) that is used for singular and plural marking. Tone of the prefixal pair does not
correlate with number; nor does it correlate with gender.
Overt number marking leading to noun class pairs and thus genders is not comprehensive in Emai. The number of nouns in each remnant gender is variable, some
exhibiting only a single root. And in contrast to gender systems of the Bantu type
found in other parts of Africa, no root participates in more than one noun class pair.",[47]

Complex predicates represent an addressee relation with V2 vbiee ‘show’ and its
human noun direct object. vbiee predications express unidirectional information
transfer from speaker to vbiee marked addressee. Predication sense assumes neither
a bidirectional verbal exchange between speaker and hearer nor a transfer of information by vocal means. V1 consists of a variety of transitive verbs of information
transfer. Predication sense is akin to English ‘express to.’

the latter consisting of a verb root and a suffix. Suffixes involved are Distributive
(DS) -lo/-lo/-no and Factative (F) -i.
Prefix a- converts intransitive activity verbs and the Distributive suffix to agentive nominals denoting animate objects. Lexemes in this class have the sense ‘animate thing characterized by repeated VERB.’

Compound lexemes in Emai reflect three compositional patterns. Analytic compounds consist of two noun stems (N-N), sometimes three (N-[N-N]). Synthetic compounds consist of a prefix followed by a verb root and a noun stem (prefix-V-N).
Phrasal compounds utilize grammatical markers in their compositional make up (Nmarker-N).","[77, 78, 79, 80]"

relations instrument, means, stimulus or durative time. Assignment of a particular
relation correlates in large measure with event verb type: instrument with change of
state, means with activity, stimulus with cognition, and temporal duration with
prolonged activity verbs, as illustrated immediately below.

Complex predicates show deictic motion verbs in the expression of locative goal
relations. Two verbs differentiated by aspect are involved. Deictic verbs vare ‘came,
will come’ or vade ‘comes, coming’ each take a locative vbì complement as V2 in
series. A third deictic verb lode ‘go’ appears only as a simple predicate. It fails to
occur in complex predicates.

its locative vbi complement in perfect or prospective aspect. Locatives in vare predications coincide with speaker location. Event motion is directed toward the speakerDeictic directional participants | 659and the vare goal. V1 in complex vare predications consists of verbs that are transitive (e.g. sua ‘push,’ fioo ‘blow,’ nwu ‘take/carry’) or intransitive (e.g. la ‘run’).

The deictic verb lode ‘go’ appears only in simple predications. It fails in complex
predications. As a simple predicate, lode takes a following vbi phrase complement.
It never occurs with a preceding vbi phrase and verb za ‘be located’ in series. lode
expresses direction of motion relative to a locative reference point and speaker.
Motion is toward the reference point and away from the speaker. Speaker position in
lode predications is assumed to be distinct from locative reference point. Moreover,

Complex predicates articulate a relation of source and goal with za ‘move/be located’ and its locative vbi complement as V1 in series. V2 consists of either ye ‘move
toward,’ se ‘move as far as/ reach’ or de re ‘fall to.’ Predication sense is ‘from location X to location Y.’
Source-Goal (SG) predications differentially articulate horizontal and vertical
motion as well as spatial and temporal extent. Motion on the horizontal plane with
no expression of manner is conveyed by za in series with ye. za and its complement
must precede ye and its complement, as is the case with all SG predications. A reversal in the order of these verb phrases, i.e. goal then source, is unacceptable.

the man PRP.be.loc LOC Afuze move.to Oke

To express manner of motion from source to goal on the horizontal plane, za occurs

As indicated above, noun phrases serving as vbi complements in SG constructions
accept place or temporal nouns. With a human (ójé) or animate noun as reference
point, syntactic elaboration is required. For example, source and goal can each
show a pronominally headed relative clause framed by ri ‘be located.’670 | Participant expressing complex predicates(280) ò zá

In addition, it is important to recognize that not every participant in a serial verb construction
serves as an event argument, where argument refers to a relation entailed by an event. This seems
particularly the case with substitutive, comitative and sociative participant roles that follow V1 in
serial verb constructions and the comparative participant role that occurs as V2 in series.","[681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697]"

Despite their class membership function, CMB constructions never frame taxonomic
statements in which one referent is ranked relative to another using a specific to
general scale, respectively.

vbì éàmì.
leopard the leopard be animal
‘A / The leopard is an animal.’
As previously indicated, CMB constructions limit polarity and mood. Negative
polarity is the norm. Under extremely rich contextual conditions but never at the
onset of a discourse, affirmative CMB constructions occur. When they do, vbi tone is
obligatorily low.
(28) ólí ómòhè vbì óì.
the man be thief
‘The man is a thief.’
CMB constructions partially limit mood expression. They appear as polar questions with Perfect Negation (ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óì? [the man SC NEG be thief] ‘Isn't the
man a thief?’) and focus (óì lí ólí ómóhé ù? [thief PF the man be] ‘Is it a thief that the
man is?’). CMB does not occur as an imperative or prohibitive.
CMB accepts few forms prototypically associated with Emai verb phrases. It limits verbal affixes, inflection, auxiliaries, preverbs, post-verbal particles and temporal deictic adjuncts. Although CMB prefers negation, it does not inflect for perfect,
imperfect or prospective aspect. Likewise, it rejects verbal affixes, such as Distributive lo/lo/no (*élí ímòhè í ì vbì-lò óì [the men SC NEG be-DS thief] ‘Each of the men is
not a thief’).
Similarly, CMB frames restrict auxiliaries and preverbs. They disallow modality,
both deontic (Hortative í) and epistemic (Certaintive ma), as well as relative tense,434 | Be, do, happen and haveAnterior ke in (*ólí ómòhè í ì í / má / ké vbì óì [the man SC NEG HOR CER ANT be
thief] ‘The man should not be/ is surely not / is not since then a thief’). Under special usage conditions involving fixed metaphor, the vbi copula occurs with Anterior
relative tense ke (áwé ísì òí í ì ké vbì égbé ísì òí [legs ASS her SC NEG ANT be body
ASS her] ‘Her legs do not feel part of her body anymore’).
CMB constructions allow only one preverb. They accept evaluative preverb kuku
(ólí úkpùn í ì kùkú vbì ísì òjè [the cloth SC NEG POEV be ASS Oje] ‘Afterall, the cloth is
not Oje's’). Remaining preverb classes are rejected, namely aspectualizer (Additive
gbo), subject attributive (totóbo), temporal (kpao), manner-demonstrative (ìyó) and
quantity (gba): (*élí ímòhè í ì gbó / tòtóbó / kpàó / ìyó / gbá vbì óì [the men SC NEG
ADD / intensely /initially / DMD /COL be thief] ‘The men are not also / intensely /
initially / that way / together thieves’).
CMB also restricts postverbal temporal particles and adverbs. It rejects Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óí lèé / gbè [the
man SC NEG be thief TEMP / much] ‘The man is not a thief already / too much of a
thief’). It disallows deictic adjuncts, e.g. èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óí
èghéènà [the man SC NEG be thief recently] ‘The man was not a thief recently’).
Noun phrase positions in CBM constructions are restricted by NP type and definiteness but not animacy or number. Assigned nominals preceding the CMB copula
allow all NP types and all definiteness values. The class nominal following vbi/u
accepts only common nouns and only referential indefinites. Across assigned nominal and class nominal positions, number agreement is obligatory (ólí ómòhè and
ònwìmè, élí ímòhè and ìnwìmè).
(29) a. ólí ómòhè / *élí ímòhè í ì
vbì ònwìmè.

‘The man is not a farmer.’
b. élí ímòhè / *ólí ómòhè í ì
vbì ìnwìmè.
the men
the man SC NEG be farmers
‘The men are not farmers.’
Class nominal position following vbi/u allows common nouns that are human
(áfìánmì), animate (ékpé) or inanimate (ópìà).6
(30) a. ólì òkpòsò í ì
vbì áfìánmì.

vbì ópìà.
the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass
‘The heavy one is not a cutlass.’
Some common nouns appear in CMB class position only when syntactically elaborated. Abstract nouns like èmòì ‘fault’ require a possessive modifier.
(31) ó ì
vbì émóí mè / *èmòì.

fault
‘It is not my fault.’
Class nominal position following CMB disallows proper names and personal pronouns, particularly nominative (ò) or accusative (óì) pronouns.
(32) *ólí óbò
í
ì
vbì òlólò / ò / óì.
the oraclist SC NEG be Ololo he him
‘The oraclist is not Ololo / he / him.’
Class nominal position constrains definiteness expression. Common nouns with
definite article ólí/élí are unacceptable (ónóì í ì vbì ómò / *ólí ómò [next.one SC NEG
be child the child] ‘The next one is not a useless child’), as are attributive phrase
descriptions marked by the same modifier (*ólí ékpé' í ì vbì ólí óbín' [the hawk SC
NEG be the dark.one] ‘The hawk is not the dark one’).
Class position with vbi/u disallows the entire range of postdeterminers. Unacceptable modifiers in class position include kindred élìyó and demonstrative nóì
(*ólí òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá élìyó / nóì [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass that.kind / next]
‘The heavy one is not that kind of cutlass’), universal quantifier èrèmé and cardinal
numeral èvá (*élì òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá èrèmé / èvá [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass all
two] ‘The heavy ones are not all the / the two cutlasses’) as well as existential quantifier ósò (*ólí òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá ósò [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass some] ‘The
heavy one is not some cutlass’).
However, CMB class position takes common nouns modified by Associative ísì
phrases. It does so provided there is no definite article (ólì òkhùà í ì vbì ópíá ísì òjè
/*ólí ópíá ísì òjè [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass ASS Oje the cutlass ASS Oje] ‘The
heavy one is not Oje's cutlass’). It also accepts headless associative phrases (ólì
òkhùà í ì vbì ísì òjè [the heavy.one SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The heavy one is not Oje's’).
CMB class position accepts few impersonal pronouns. It allows the numeral
pronoun úkpòkpá ‘one’ as head of a partitive vbi phrase whose complement is a
pronominally headed relative clause. A numeral pronoun greater than one (e.g. èvá)
as head of a partitive phrase is unacceptable (*élí ópíá nà í ì vbì èvá vbí élí á ló shènnò [the cutlass these SC NEG be two LOC ones one PRED sell-DS] ‘These cutlasses are436 | Be, do, happen and havenot two of the ones that will be sold’). All other impersonal pronouns are rejected:
demonstrative, universal and existential quantifier, kindred and collective numeral.

vbì úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló
shèn.
the cutlass this SC NEG be one
LOC ones one PRED sell
‘This cutlass is not one of the ones that will be sold.’
Assigned position preceding the CMB copula exhibits contrasting values as to
NP type and definiteness but not animacy. Regarding NP type, it accepts proper
names (òlólò) and subject position pronouns (má, yán) but not the indefinite subject
pronoun (a).
(34) a. òlólò í ì
vbì óì.
Ololo SC NEG be thief
‘Ololo is not a thief.’
b. má / yán / *á
ì
vbì óì.
we they one NEG be thief
‘We / they are not thieves.’
Assigned position in vbi/u constructions accepts common nouns regardless of
animacy. They must, however, be syntactically elaborated.7 Assigned position permits human (òkpòsò), nonhuman animate (áwá) and inanimate (ópìà) nouns, provided each is elaborated by, for example, definite article ólì.
(35) a. ólì òkpòsò / *òkpòsò í ì
vbì óèjè.
the woman woman SC NEG be chief
‘The woman is not a chief.’
b. ólí áwà / *áwà í ì

c. ólí ópìà / *ópìà

the cutlass

‘The cutlass is not Oje's.’
Abstract common nouns in CMB assigned position are not limited in the same way.
The noun úkhùè ‘curse’ in assigned position disallows the definite predeterminer
and any other modifier.
(36) úkhùè / *ólí úkhùè / *úkhùè lí òdè
í ì
vbì émí lì èsèn.
cursing the curse
curse R yesterday SC NEG be thing R good
‘Cursing is not a good thing.’‘be’ forms | 437The assigned constituent in CMB need not be overtly marked by the definite
predeterminer. Common nouns occur in assigned position when modified only by a
collective numeral, e.g. èvèvá in (ímóhé èvèvá í ì vbì ìnwìmè [men both SC NEG be
farmers] ‘Both men are not farmers’). Assigned position common nouns do not require the definite article when modified by Associative ísì (ólí áwà / áwá ísì òjè í ì vbì
áànmì [the dog dog ASS Oje SC NEG be female] ‘The dog of Oje / Oje’s dog is not
female’) or Relator li relative clause (ólí ópíá / ópíá lí ólí ómóhé nwú' fì á í ì vbì ísì òjè
[the cutlass cutlass R the man take propel CS SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The / A cutlass
that the man threw away was not Oje's’).
Other modifiers that affect referent construal appear in assigned position. These
include postdeterminer demonstratives nà and nóì (ólí ópíá nà / ópíá nóì í ì vbì ólí á
ré' gbé ólí éwè [the cutlass this cutlass next SC NEG be one one use kill the goat]
‘This cutlass / The next cutlass is not the one used to kill the goat’).
More constrained in assigned position are cardinal numerals and quantifier
postdeterminers. Cardinal numerals require the definite predeterminer (élí ópìà èvá
/ *ópìà èvá í ì vbì ísì òjè [the cutlass two cutlass two SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The two
cutlasses are not Oje's’) or a complement consisting of a partitive vbi phrase (ópìà
èvá vbì ò í ì vbì ísì òjè [cutlass two LOC it SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘Two cutlasses from
them were not Oje's’).
Assigned position rejects quantifier and kindred forms. Excluded are existential
quantifiers ósò and óvbèé (*ópíá ósò / óvbèé í ì vbì ísì òjè [cutlass some other SC NEG
be ASS Oje] ‘Some / Another cutlass is not Oje’s’) and kindred élìyó (*ópíá élìyó í ì vbì
ísì òjè [cutlass that.kind SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘A cutlass of that kind is not Oje's’).
Impersonal pronouns in assigned position are partially restricted. Acceptable
are demonstrative ònà and ónóì (ònà / ónóì í ì vbì ísì èé [this.one next.one SC NEG be
ASS your] ‘This one / the next one is not yours’) as well as plural existential ésò (ésò
í ì vbì ísì èmé [some.ones SC NEG be ASS my] ‘None are mine’).
In assigned position, numeral pronouns reveal a mixed distribution. Collective
numeral pronouns (èvèvá) are acceptable (èvèvá í ì vbì ísì èmé [all.two SC NEG be
ASS my] ‘Both are not mine’), whereas cardinal numeral pronouns (èvá, òkpá) require a following partitive vbi phrase (èvá vbí élì ògèdè / *èvá í ì vbì ísì èmé [two LOC
the banana two SC NEG be ASS my] ‘Two of the bananas are not mine’). Morphological reformulation is also required for òkpá ‘one,’ e.g. úkpòkpá (úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló
shèn í ì vbì ísì òjè [one LOC ones one PRED sell SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘One of those that
will be sold is not Oje’s’).
Nonetheless, assigned position reveals the unacceptability of remaining pronouns. Kindred forms fail, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn (*élìyó í ì vbì ísì òjè
[that.kind SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘That kind of one is not Oje’s’), as does the contrastive
existential pronoun óvbèé (*óvbèé í ì vbì ísì òjè [other.one SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘Another one is not Oje’s’).","[458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463]"
