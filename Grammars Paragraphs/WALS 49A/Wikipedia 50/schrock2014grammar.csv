"2326.1Case overview
“The case marking typology of a language is surely its most central
typological parameter, since almost all other parts of the grammar
must interact with it.”—Talmy Givón, quoted by Serzisko (1992:50)All Ik nominals must be inflected for case, and formal parallels of nominal
case markers are found in other diverse parts of the grammar. Due to its
grammatical centrality, the Ik case system has already been the subject of
several works (e.g. Heine 1990, König 2002, König 2008, and Schrock
2014). As König defines it, “a case system is an inflexional system of
marking nouns or noun phrases for the type of relationship they bear to
their heads… expressed by affixes, tone, accent shift, or root reduction…”
(2008:5). Out of the above list, Ik uses a combination of affixes and stem
reduction to encode case relations. The affixes are suffixes, and stem
reduction means the stem-final vowel is deleted before some case suffixes.
Ik employs eight cases to encode grammatical relations between verbs and
their arguments, or between arguments and modifiers (genitive). In König’s
African case typology, Ik is a Type 2 split-accusative system in which both the
nominative and accusative cases are marked (2008:10). It is ‘accusative’ in
that when core clausal arguments are marked differently from each other, S
and A take the nominative case, while O takes the accusative case. And it is
‘split’ in that this accusativity only occurs when the subject (A) is third
person. The objects (O) of first and second person subjects (A/S) take the
nominative case. And when a subject (A/S) is preposed before the verb, for
example in most types of subordinate clauses, it also takes the accusative.

SNOMACC233Blake defines case as a typical system of “marking the relationship of a noun
to a verb at the clause level or of a noun to a preposition, postposition or
another noun at the phrase level” (1994:1). True to this definition, Ik case
encodes the grammatical relations between a verb and its core arguments
and any non-core arguments. And though in Ik the genitive case can mark
arguments for some verbs, its main function is to mark the relationship
between a noun phrase and a possessive nominal modifier.
A ‘core argument’ in Ik is generally defined as any verbal argument that
cannot be represented by the dummy pronoun (§5.10). Normally such
arguments are encoded with the nominative, accusative, or copulative cases,
but as explained below, various complications occur. And as its label
suggests, the ‘oblique’ case straddles the simple divide between ‘core’ and
‘non-core’ cases: It actually encodes all core arguments in imperative and
optative clauses, as well as a variety of peripheral argument roles in other
types of clauses, but it cannot be represented by the dummy pronoun. The
basic case-marking scheme for clausal arguments in Ik is presented in (3):

bone-ACC234Subjects (A/S) of conditional/hypothetical subordinate clauses with a
sequential verb form are also marked with the nominative case. (This is
because the syntax is interpreting the conjunction na as filling the verbal
slot; indeed it can be followed by both tense and adverbial enclitics as any
typical verb would. For more on subordinate clause syntax, see §9.9):
(6)Na bia iryameiduo kaudzoe,…
na=bi-aSiryám-é-idu-okaúdzo-eCONJ =you.SG- NOMget-VEN-2SG-SEQmoney-DATIf you come across money,…

you.SG-ACCIf you get thirsty,… (lit. ‘If the sun starts eating you,…)
But subjects (A/S) of all other types of subordinate clauses take the
accusative case. In such clauses, the constituent order is SV/AVO, a
deviation from the language’s unmarked VS/VAO order. For yet unknown
reasons, Ik syntax marks preverbal subjects (with the above exceptions of
sequential subordinate clauses) with the accusative case, as in:
(8)Noo ncia kwatsiyaad,…
nooɲ́ci-aSkwáts-í-í-a=dᵉCONJ.PST3I-ACCsmall-PLUR-1SG- REAL=DPWhen I was small,…
(9)Naa oŋoria wetetie koinia,…
náaoŋori-aAwét-ét-i-eCONJelephant-ACCdrink-VEN-3SG-SIML scent-ACCWhen the elephant catches the scent,…kɔɪ ́ná-a235However, the subjects (A/S)—or ‘vocatives’ if one prefers—of imperative
and optative clauses take the oblique case:
(10)Ƙae bi ɗemusǃ
ƙa-ébiSɗɛmʊsgo-IMP.SGyou.SG[OBL]quicklyYou go quicklyǃ
(11)Goƙaaketano njinǃ
ɡoƙ-aak-ét-anoɲjínSseated-DISTR-INCH-OPTwe.INC[OBL]Let us be seatedǃ
The direct object (O) of a transitive clause in the indicative mood, with a
first or second person subject, also takes the nominative case:
(12)Atsʼuƙotima naa ŋur.
átsʼ-ʊ́ƙɔt-ɪ ́m-á=naaŋʊr-ᵃOeat-COMP-1PL.EXC-REAL=PST1cane.rat- NOMWe ate the cane rat up.

But the direct object (O) of 1) any clause with a third-person subject or 2)
any transitive subordinate clause takes the ccusative case:

átsʼ-ákwɛt-aɲ́ci-kᵃOeat[3SG ]-REALarm-NOMI-ACCMy arm is hurting me.","[263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"
"The nominals in (32), while today still full nouns in their own right, also
function in compounds with semi-grammatical functions. It looks like a slow245transition from noun to adposition or inflectional morpheme is currently
underway. Admittedly a matter of speculation, this idea is given just as a
possible scenario for how Ik case suffixes developed. And unfortunately, it is
not known whether any of the Ik case suffixes could be tied to any nouns
with full lexical status synchronically; these have yet to be identified.
In terms of areal parallels for the Ik case system, the closest place to look is
Teso-Turkana. Dimmendaal’s description of the Turkana case system reveals
a few similarities with Ik but also substantial differences (1983:66-67). With
six cases (absolutive, nominative, genitive, instrumental, locative, and
vocative), Turkana has almost as many as Ik. But a crucial difference is that
Turkana cases are marked with tone rather than affixes. Also, while Ik is
both a marked nominative and marked accusative language, Turkana is only
a marked nominative language: Direct objects, indirect objects, and a noun’s
citation form are all unmarked as absolutive. But post-verbal clauses
subjects take the tonally marked nominative case. So if Teso-Turkana had
influence on the development of the Ik case system, it was through syntax
only and not morphology. Tone plays no role at all in Ik case marking.
As a putative close relative of Ik, the Kuliak So exhibits substantial
morphological decay of an older Kuliak case system that Ik has more fully
retained (Carlin 1993:90-93). The table in (33) presents the author’s
analysis of the current overlap between the case systems in both languages.
Namely, the So ‘goal’ case morpheme -Vk is a relic of the Ik dative case
morpheme {-kɛ} but has taken only some of its semantic roles (goal and
recipient). The Location role of the Ik dative case has been assumed by the
So ‘locative’ case -a/o. But this case now also shares roles handled by the Ik
ablative case {-ɔ} (e.g. location) and in one of its allomorphs shares the
form as well. The So ‘circumstantial’ case seems to take its current form
(-ʊk) from the Ik copulative case, which, in combination with a verb-final
vowel often looks like -ʊkᵓ. The So circumstantial case shares the semantic
roles of instrument and cause with the Ik ablative case:246(33)Comparison of Ik and So case suffixes

"2025.1.1 Free personal pronouns
The Ik free personal pronouns are free grammatical words. The hyphenated
forms in (1) signify not prefixation but rather roots in need of case suffixes:

pronouns. The nominative and instrumental case forms for 1SG reflect the
morpho-phonological de-affrication described in §2.5.2. And in the ablative
and copulative cases, there is some variation in the degree to which the
pronoun-final /i/ assimilates to the case suffix consisting of /o/ (§2.5.4):

relationship between the first person free pronouns: the singular ɲ́ ci- ‘I’, and
the plural ŋɡó- and ɲjíní- ‘we’. It looks like the 1PL.INC ɲjíní- is a pluralization
of the first person singular ɲ́ ci-. Recall from §4.2.5 that the possessive
plurative {-ɪnɪ} may be used to pluralize a possessed or associated person or
object. In light of this, the 1PL.INC ɲjíní- can be analyzed as ɲc+ɪnɪ- → ɲc-íní→ ɲjíní-. The change in voicing from /c/ to /j/ is seen in modern Ik in
another pronominal form: ɲj-ɛ́nɪ́- ‘mine’, where -ɛ́nɪ́ is an impersonal
possessum marker (§5.2). Semantically, the first person plural inclusive
pronoun may have grammaticalized from a word meaning something like
‘my Xs’ or ‘those associated with me’, i.e., including you the addressee(s).
Second, there also seems to be a morphological relationship between the
first person plural exclusive ŋɡó- and both ɲ́ ci- and ɲjíní-. While the link
between ɲ́ ci- and ɲjíní- hinges on the voicing alternation /c/~/j/, a link
between ɲjíní- and ŋɡó- is suggested by the de-affrication described in
§2.5.2. In short, affricates tend to surface as stops before the vowels /a/ or
/ɔ, o/, and /j/~/ɡ/ is a well-attested example. So the pronoun ɲjíní- could
alternatively be a pluralization of ŋɡó-, where ɲj- is the underlying
morpheme, hardened to ɲɡ- before /o/. So although the evolutionary
direction taken by these three first-person pronouns cannot yet be
determined, it seems that a proto-morpheme *ɲj/ɲc/ŋɡ underlies them all.
Then, in terms of areal and possibly genetic parallels, the 1SG pronoun ɲ́ cirecalls the 1SG possessive cú of Dhaasanac (Tosco 2001:64), and in its
nominative form (ŋ́k-) the Eastern Semitic anaku and East Cushitic ani/anu.
Tucker even suggested a link between Ik pronouns and ‘Erythraic’, using
Middle Egyptian as a reference point (1967b:675). The Ik 1PL.EXC ŋɡóclosely resembles the 1PL.INC ŋwɔnɪ́ of Turkana (Dimmendaal 1983:207).
Although these two pronouns differ in clusivity, their relationship looks
promising. Otherwise, the Ik free pronouns most closely resemble those of
the other Kuliak languages, as shown below (in comparison with Turkana):204(3)Kuliak free personal pronouns

The paradigm shows significant unity among the Kuliak languages, but
some marked influence from Teso-Turkana, particularly in 1SG and 1PL.EXC.
Syntactically, the free personal personal pronouns behave like full nouns.
Their ability to inflect for case allows them to replace any noun operating as
any clausal argument. As shown below, they can even be modified by
demonstratives (3) and relative clauses (4):
(3)Ƙamie njinie nii,...
ƙám-í-eɲjíní-e=niílike-3SG-SIMLwe.INC-GEN=DEM.PLLike we here (for example)…
(4)Bita ni muɗukanaakit,...
bit-a=nimúɗúk-án-aak-ít-ᵃyou.PL-NOM =REL.PL blind-STAT-DISTR-2PL-REAL
You who are blind,...
Ik is a pro-drop language, so the free personal pronouns are not required if
their referent is a subject or object. They can be used in addition to the
pronominal subject-agreement suffixes if more emphasis is needed.","[233, 234, 235, 236]"
"2526.3.2 Nominative
The nominative case suffix {-a} has engendered more than its share of
confusion in the descriptive literature. Referring to this morpheme, Heine &
König state that “Like Crazzolara, we consider the ‘complemental suffix’ to
be a functionally empty appendage of nouns…in their unmarked form.
Accordingly, it is interpreted as a morphologically redundant ending…”
(1996:137). Later, the segmental similarity between the nominative {-a}
and the accusative {-(k)a} led to the following comment (König 2008:73):
“The final vowel -a has a unique value in the system. All words or
particles of the language end by default in the vowel -a, and so are
nominative and accusative case forms (in the non-final form). It
remains unclear whether the - a of the nominative and accusative is
triggered by the general rule of the language to use vowel -a as a
default ending of each word or whether -a has the value of an
independent case suffix encoding nominative or accusative.”
By contrast, the claim made in this grammar is that the morpheme {-a} is
functionally very significant, as both a marker of nominative case and realis
modality in the verbal system (§7.6.2). This morpheme has a L tone but
assimilates to the tone melody projected by the stem it attaches to (T7). It is
one of the language’s opaque dominant suffixes (§3.1.3), and as such can
also be represented as {-a+}. One if the nominative’s characteristics that has
produced confusion in the past is its subtraction of stem-final vowels. It and
the instrumental case suffix {-ɔ} are the only two cases that do this. Before
pauses, the nominative surfaces as /-ᵃ/ or /-∅/. Lastly, if a noun’s final
vowel is a back vowel, it may desyllabify before {-a}:253(56)Nominative case paradigm

predict whether the vowel will be deleted or desyllabified. Out of a sample
of sixty-eight nouns ending in a back vowel, only the following fifteen
(22%) underwent desyllabification (in order of root-final back vowel):

vowel entirely in the nominative and instrumental cases (see next section),
as in sɔkɔ́- → sɔk-a ‘root- NOM’ and habu- → hab-a ‘tree.hive-NOM’. Looking at
nouns that delete their final vowel versus those that desyllabify it, the
reason for this discrepancy is not obvious. It likely represents a historical
morphological change toward or away from desyllabification. That
nominative-case desyllabification is lexical and not post-lexical is shown by
the fact that compensatory lengthening does not occur on the case suffix.
Back vowels also desyllabify after the non-final accusative case allomorph /a/, but when they do, compensatory lengthening occurs. For example,
compare dakú- ‘tree’ as dakw-a ‘tree-NOM’ and as dakw-áá ‘tree-ACC’.
The nominative case marks out the following five grammatical functions:

"5189.10.1 Verbless copulative clause
Verbless copulative clauses—covered in this section—are ‘verbless’ in the
sense that they put a nominal marked with the copulative case in the
predicate slot. This construction differs from the verbless dative/genitive
clauses which are ‘verbless’ in the sense that they exhibit no predicate slot
at all in the surface structure. In verbless copulative clauses, the predicative
nominal can consist of a noun, pronoun, or nominalized verb. What allows a
noun phrase to function as predicate is none other than the copulative case
(described in detail in §6.3.8). In the copulative case, the copulative suffix
{-kɔ} affixes to the underlying form of the nominal stem:
(143)Copulative predicates
LexicalCopulativecekí-‘woman’→cekú-kᵒ‘It’s a woman’ntsí-‘s/he/it’→ntsú-kᵒ‘It’s she.’dód-oni-‘to hurt’→dód-onu-kᵒ‘It’s pain.’The copulative case enables a verbless grammatical alternative to the copula
of identity mɪt-. Though mɪt- expresses both identity and possession, the
copulative case expresses strictly identity. Serzisko further qualifies the
meaning of mɪt- as one of ascription/description’ compared to that of the
copulative which expresses ‘specification’ (1992:55ff).
Just as mɪt- takes a copula subject (CS) and copula complement (CC),
verbless clauses with nominal heads take a verbless clause subject (VCS) and
verbless clause complement (VCC; Dixon 2010:160). Ik being an eminently
argument-dropping language, the VCS is often omitted, leaving only the
VCC in the copulative case. When the VCS is present, it takes the
nominative case as would an S or A subject under most other conditions. In
the following examples, the first clause represents a standard copular
construction, while the second illustrates the verbless copula clause:519(144)Mitia nka ʝakam.","[549, 550, 551]"
"171.2.2 Typology
The difficulty in classifying Ik genetically stems largely from its unique and
eclectic typological profile among other languages in East Africa. This
typological profile is summarized below and illustrated with an annotated
text. The goal of this section is to give the reader an overall impression of
the language—a sort of typological Gestalt―in case there is no time to read
through each chapter in detail. The overview begins with phonology and
then proceeds through morphology, syntax, and finally the annotated text.
In terms of phonology, Ik has thirty-nine (39) contrastive sounds: thirty (30)
consonants and nine (9) vowels. Consonants made with pulmonic airstream
include plosives, affricates, fricatives, liquids, nasals, and glides. Those
made with glottalic airstream include implosives and ejectives. The three
lateral fricatives and ejectives Ik once used are now almost entirely lost.
Eight of the nine vowels consist of [+ATR]/[-ATR] pairs that operate in a
[+ATR]-dominant vowel harmony system. The low vowel /a/ is opaque but
can be lexically (morphologically) specified with either [ATR] value.
The rightward edge of an Ik phonological phrase is strictly observed. This
means that the final segment of any word or morpheme, whether consonant
or vowel, is reduced before a pause. In this reduction, consonants may be
partially devoiced and/or unreleased, while vowels are usually fully
devoiced or deleted. Devoiced consonants and vowels are allophonic, not
phonemic. Other allophonic changes observed among consonants include
nasal assimilation, place assimilation, implosivization, and debuccalization,
while other allophones among vowels arise from raising and glottalization.
At the juncture of morphemes, certain consonants may be deleted and vowel
may assimilate partially or totally to nearby vowels.
The template (C)V can generate all lawful phonological syllables in Ik, and
the concatenation of morphemes may require resyllabifications in the form
of vowel epenthesis, inter-consonantal syncope, vowel deletion, haplology,18desyllabification/compensatory lengthening, and metathesis. At the surface
level, the template (C)V(V)(C) generates all lawful phonetic syllables.
Ik is a tonal language with two underlying tone levels: H and L. Ik has
lexical tone though few tonal minimal pairs. There is no grammatical tone
in the sense of a morpheme made up solely of a tonal autosegment.
However, tone changes do accompany various segmental morphemes. Htone may surface phonetically as high, high-falling, or downstepped high
pitch. L-tone may surface as low, low-falling, or mid pitch. Voiced
obstruents function pervasively as depressor consonants, pulling the pitch of
a preceding high tone to high-falling, mid, or low pitch. Downdrift occurs,
as well as depressor-consonant induced downstep. All noun and verb roots
have a lexically assigned tone melody whose surface realization may change
according to grammatical context. Stem-level and phrase-level tonal
processes are complex and appear to count metrical feet in the
(re)assignment of tones. At the clause level, at least three intonational
patterns can be observed: the indicative, interrogative, and the ‘solicitive’.
Morphologically, Ik is mostly agglutinative. Roots and affixes can typically
be separated out linearly. Except for lexicalized prefixes on words borrowed
from other languages, Ik is exclusively suffixing. On the continuum between
analytic and polysynthetic, Ik ranks as moderately synthetic: Only three
suffixes can be attached to noun roots, while up to six can be attached to
verb roots (one more if one counts root reduplication).
In terms of form, verb roots tend to have a (V)(C)VC syllabic shape. Verb
roots can be partially or fully reduplicated, though only full reduplication is
productive. Ik verbs may be intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, or
ambitransitive. Tonal verbal minimal pairs signify only slight semantic
differences, and a small subset of verbs are inherently pluractional.
A basic morphological division in the verbal system is realis-irrealis. This
division is posited more on the basis of morphology than semantics. Other19verbal extensions include suffixes to nominalize the verb, give it directional
deixis, subject agreement, or non-core argument reference. And yet other
suffixes give the verb modal, aspectual, valency-changing, or polarity
properties. Most attributive (descriptive) notions are handled by intransitive
‘adjectival’ verbs in Ik. Tense, contrary to aspect and modality, is
communicated by clitics and lays out a three-level time deixis in both the
past and non-past. Ik uses a variety of strategies to express epistemic status.
The majority of Ik nouns have a CVC(V) or CVCVC(V) syllable shape.
Roughly one third of the nominal lexicon begins with the Teso-Turkana
gender prefix ɲV- (or one of its locative allomorphs) which as been
lexicalized in Ik. Noun roots may also be partially or fully reduplicated,
though neither strategy is productive in the language. Each noun has a
lexical tone melody that can change in various morphological and syntactic
contexts. Nominal suffixes include a two types of singulative, five types of
plurative and eight case endings. The language’s limited noun suffixation is
counterbalanced by productive (pro-)nominal compounding.
Case—an interface of phonology, morphology, syntax—is a pan-systemic
feature of Ik grammar. Not only must every noun be inflected for case, but
even some of the verbal suffixes appear to be grammaticalized case markers.
The Ik case system is split-accusative: Direct objects are marked in the
nominative case with 1/2-person subjects and in the accusative with 3person subjects. In the Ik system, eight cases are observed: nominative,
instrumental, ablative, genitive, accusative, dative, copulative, and oblique.
Nouns and verbs represent the two open lexical word classes in Ik. Other,
closed word classes include the pronouns, quantifiers, demonstratives,
adverbs, conjunctions, interjections, infantile imperatives, ideophones. The
seven personal pronouns incorporate three persons, three numbers, and an
inclusive/exclusive distinction in first person plural. Non-verbal quantifiers
and adverbs exist but are very few. Demonstratives provide spatial deixis in
three degrees of distance (near/medial/far) and temporal deixis in four20degrees of time (tense). Other demonstratives provide anaphoric reference
for either actual discourse or a shared deictic context. Lastly, Ik makes wide
use of ideophones to colorfully enhance the meaning of verbs.
In noun phrases, modifiers follow the head noun. Modifiers consist of
genitive noun phrases, adjectival verbs, quantifiers, and other relative
clauses. Relative pronouns mark the number of their noun head as well as
the tense of the predicate in the relative clause. The fullest statement of the
‘common argument’ of a main and relative clause is in the main clause. Like
in other subordinate clauses, the syntax of relative clauses is marked.
The basic, unmarked constituent order of Ik main clauses is VSO (VS/VAO),
but SVO is attested in subordinate clauses. In a main clause, the verb comes
first, followed by a tense clitic (if present) and then the subject and object(s)
if explicitly mentioned (both subjects and objects may be left implicit in Ik.)
Peripheral arguments come next, followed by any adverbs.
Clause chaining is a definitive aspect of Ik discourse. An initial controlling
clause sets the TAM context for the chain of clauses to follow. Clause chains
may consist of one or many more sequential clauses or one or two
simultaneous clauses. Chained simultaneous clauses may be used as a
complementation strategy and in bi-clausal comparative constructions.
The Ik lexicon exhibits several recognizable substrata. Perhaps the oldest
substratum can simply be called ‘Ik’ since it has yet to be tied to any other
subgroup within Africa. Ik of course shares numerous lexemes with the
other Kuliak languages, Nyang’ía and So. A handful of lexemes have
parallels in Didinga (Surmic). A fair number of Ik lexemes appear to be preor proto-Nilotic, while very many more are obviously cognate with forms in
Eastern, Southern, and even Western Nilotic. A substantial number of core
lexemes are also traceable to Afroasiatic Cushitic languages like Afar/Saho,
Dhaasanac, Tsʼamakko, and West Rift Cushitic. Finally, English (Germanic)
and Swahili (Bantu) have in recent centuries loaned quite a few lexemes.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"
"2676.3.5 Genitive
The genitive case suffix has the form {-ɛ}. It is possible that this morpheme
is a reflex of the ancient Eastern Sudanic genitive case marker *-ɪ/i
(Dimmendaal 2010:34). A similar form (-i) is found in the Cushitic
languages Afar, Beja, and Bilin. Another promising connection is with the
Shabo (Nilo-Saharan or unclassified) genitive marker -ke (Teferra 1991:9).
This connection is appealing because it could help explain why the Ik
genitive suffix does not subtract the stem-final vowel. If an older form was
*-kɛ, then the stem-final vowel would be kept to prevent a CC cluster.
The genitive suffix has a L tone but can take a H depending on the melody
of the preceding stem (T7). It is recessively [-ATR] but can harmonize to
/-e/ when afffixed to [+ATR] stems. Like the ablative, the genitive suffix
does not subtract the stem-final vowel. And before a pause, the genitive is
devoiced to /-ᵋ/ or /-ᵉ/. When the stem ends in non-low front vowel, it is
usually inaudible [-∅]. And when a noun stem ends in a high back vowel,
that vowel may desyllabify to [w] causing compensatory lengthening on the
following genitive suffix. Lastly, the genitive suffix may totally assimilate a
stem-final /a/ or other [-ATR] vowel in non-final noun forms.

(107)Genitive case grammatical functions
1To mark the nominal modifier of a noun phrase head2To mark the complement of a similative clauseIn the genitive’s first function—to mark a noun dependent on its noun
phrase head—the genitive-marked noun encodes Possession broadly
construed, including notions of ownership, whole-part, kinship, attribution,
orientation, association, and nominalization; see also §9.2:
(108)Ownership:Kisanini kuruɓadiicikaa nti.

ńꜜdaɪkam-ɛ́s-ʊ́ƙɔtɪɲɔ́kɔkɔrɔ́-ᵋandcatch-INF -COMP[OBL]chicken(s)-GENAnd they caught the chickens.
In Ik, nouns with the genitive case can also modify a noun phrase head that
is left implicit. The omitted NP must be the complement of a copular verb
like mɪt- ‘be sb. or sth.’ or bení- ‘not be sb. or sth.’, for example:
(115)Benia ngoe.
beni-áŋɡó-ᵉnot.be-REAL we.EXC-GEN
It is not ours (lit. ‘It is not X of ours’).
(116)Mita roɓee ni wetiat.
mɪt-aróɓe-e=niwet-í-át-ᵃbe-REALpeople-GEN=REL.PL drink-PLUR-3PL-REALIt (i.e. tobacco) is of people who snuff (lit. ‘drink’) regularly.
One of the language’s strategies for coordinating and subordinating clauses
is to nominalize a clause’s verb into an infinitive (as in example 114 above).
When this happens, the subject and object (if present) of the nominalized
verb follow it in the genitive case, as shown in (117) and (118) below:270(117)Arutetona ebee,...
arút-ét-on-aɛ́ꜜbɛ-ɛ́sound-INCH-INF -NOMgun-GENAt the sound of a gunshot (lit. ‘the sounding of a gun’),...
(118)Nda ƙooni ntie sabak.
ńꜜdaƙo-onińtí-esaba-kᵉandgo-INF [OBL] they-GENriver-DATAnd they went to the river (lit. ‘and the going of them to the river’).
In another special construction, the roles of the NP head and genitive
modifier can be reversed so that the possessor is now the head. The sentence
in (119) shows the noun ámá- ‘person’ modified by the ‘one’ (kɔnɪ ́-), even
though it is ámá- that is in the genitive case. Then in (120), the pronominal
form ntsɛ́nɪ́ modifies ɲeɓuryaŋíᵉ, though the latter is in the genitive:
(119)Atsuo kona amae.
ats-u-okɔn-aámá-ᵉcome-3SG -SEQone-NOMperson-GENAnother person should come.
(120)Ŋana nda ntseni ɲeɓuryaŋi.
ŋan-ańꜜdants-ɛ́nɪ ́ɲeɓuryaŋí-∅each-NOMwiths/he-PSSM[OBL] container-GENEach person with his or her own (snuff) container.
Besides Possession, the second grammatical function of the genitive is to
mark the complement of a similative clause. Similative clauses in Ik are
formed with the special verb ƙám- ‘be like’ (cf. Swahili kama and West Rift
Cushitic qoom-). Similative clauses have the schema ‘X is like Y’, where X is
in the nominative case and Y in the genitive case. This in interestisng
example of a genitive used as a clausal argument instead of an NP modifier:271(121)Ƙamata dziberikae.
ƙám-át-adzibér-íka-ᵉbe.like-3PL- REALaxe-PL-GENThey are like axes.
(122)Biraa keda ƙamad.
bɪra-akéꜜd-aƙám-á=dᵉnot.be-REALway-NOMbe.like-REAL=DPThere is nothing it is like.
In (122), the verb ƙám- is in a relative clause (without a relative pronoun)
modifying the word kédᵃ ‘way, manner’. Because the complement of the
similative relative clause is missing from the relative clause, the dummy
pronoun (DP) is used to mark its absence (see §5.10).","[298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303]"
"291In König’s view, both the copulative case suffix and the sequential
(‘narrative’) aspect marker were later developments from a nominal focus
marker that was also a development from a copular suffix on nouns
(2002:349-361). Paradoxically, she concludes that a focus marker encoding
discontinuity developed into a ‘narrative’ mood marker encoding discourse
continuity (2002:360). From a synchronic point of view, the copulative case
in the nominal system and the sequential aspect in the verbal system do
seem to focus attention on a given noun or verb. For nouns, this attention
has a focal or copular function. For verbs, this attention simply highlights
the point-by-point sequence of a text. In both systems, the morpheme {-kɔ}
focuses attention on the respective item, as in the following:
(176)ámá-kᵒperson- COP‘It IS [a person].’ats-u-kᵒcome-3SG-SEQ‘It IS [s/he/it came].’As for the homophonous dative /simultaneous (‘sujunctive’) marker {-kɛ},
König states that “In Icetot, the starting point in the grammaticalization of
the dative into the subjunctive was probably an application of the dative as
a purpose marker: first of all, together with a noun; then with a verbal noun;
and finally, with an inflected verb” (2002: 264, italics in original).
But another explanation for the dative>simultaneous grammaticalization—
and the one adopted in this grammar—is that the dative case’s semantic role
of Location was simply extended over time from nouns to whole subordinate
clauses. If true, this would reflect one of the cross-linguistic ‘cognitivecommunicative strategies’ in grammaticalization to “treat subordinate
clauses like nouns” (Heine & Kuteva (2007:100-101). There is precedent for
this analysis in wider Nilotic and particularly in Turkana where the locative
prefix nɪ-/ni- is used for manner adverbials whether based on nouns or
verbs. As Dimmendaal states, “The semantic distinction between manner
and location...is not always clear” (1983:363-364). Just as the Ik dative case
on nouns expresses the locational senses of ‘in’, ‘on’, or ‘at’, so the292simultaneous aspect suffix seems to have over time come to encode states or
actions in or during which other states or actions are occuring, for example:
(177)Epuƙwee kiʝak.
ep-uƙw-eekíʝá-kᵉsleep-AND-IMP.SGground-DATLie down on the ground.
(178)Epuƙwee maraŋidik.
ep-uƙw-eemaráŋ-ídi-kᵉsleep-AND-IMP.SGgood-2SG-SIMLSleep well (Lit. ‘Sleep you being good’ or ‘Sleep in you being good’).
(177) is a simple command to lie down on the ground, while (178) is a
command to lie down ‘while you are good’, that is, ‘in the state of your being
good’. These examples show how the semantics of physical co-occurrence on
nouns, encoded by the dative, is extended to circumstantial co-occurrence on
verbs. Even if this analysis is correct, the two homophones in the two
grammatical systems must be treated as synchronically distinct. The location
analogy may, however, be tested as a grammaticalization hypothesis.
Taking similar points of comparison, other links can be posited between
nominal case suffixes and verbal inflectional affixes such as the following:
(179)Other hypothetical case>verbal affix grammaticalizations
CaseVerbal suffixOblique>IrrealisNominative>RealisAccusative>Present perfectGenitive>Singular imperativeAblative>Plural imperative293Schrock 2013 goes through each potential pair in (179) and determines that
some, namely the first three, are more likely than others. That view is
amended here in that only the first two are considered plausible. Those
two—oblique>irrealis and nominative>realis—are the only two that
seriously affect the analysis of the whole grammar. The other four encounter
serious problem but are still interesting for speculative historical analysis.
The hypothesis that Ik has grammaticalized the nominative suffix {-a} into a
verbal realis modality marker is analytically important. It was Heine who
first noted that the nominative case and his ‘aorist’ tense shared something
in common—the vowel /a/, which he calls the ‘thematic final a’
(1983:§2.5.3.1.1). But so far no one has explored the possibility that the
‘aorist’ marker /-a/ is a grammaticalization of the nominative case marker.
Besides their phonological identity, the nominative case {-a} and the realis
{-a} share a significant morphological characteristic: They both subtract the
final vowel of the stem or affix to which they attach. To illustrate this, the
first column in (180) shows the underlying forms, first of noun roots with
the nominative suffix, and then of verb roots and pronominal subject
markers with the realis suffix. The second column then shows how {-a} in
both systems subtracts the preceding nominal or verbal stem-final vowel:

the oblique case morpheme and the irrealis modality morpheme, both of
which are zero (∅). Being zero-marked, the oblique case allows a noun
stem’s underlying form to surface (often with minor tonal changes).
Likewise, the irrealis modality allows the underlying form of the preceding
verbal morpheme to surface. In (181), the first column presents the
underlying forms of several noun and verb stems with the oblique or Irrealis
marker. The second column reveals their non-final surface forms:

nominative case {-a} and the realis modality {-a} are related historically.
Whether one came from the other or both came from somewhere else is not
known. And based on the data in (181), the same claim can be made for the
oblique case and the irrealis modality which are both marked by {-∅}.
But beyond segmental identity and morphophonological similarity, can
these morphemes in disparate grammatical systems be linked semantically?
Tentative connections can be drawn, but they are speculative and based on
Ik’s mismatch of formal and semantic markedness. For example, just as the
nominal system marks what is common (e.g. subjects) and does not mark
what is uncommon (e.g. oblique arguments), the verbal system marks what
is actual (realis predications) and not what is unactualized (irrealis).","[322, 323, 324, 325, 326]"

Complement clauses (§9.13.1), though subordinate themselves, make
another exception to the SVO order. Since they are embedded main clauses,
they retain the VSO constituent order of non-embedded main clauses. Such
clauses are introduced by the complementizer toimɛna/toimɛnɪ- ‘that’, which,
since it is a noun and argument of the matrix clause, takes case suffixes:

bone-ACCI know that the dog is gnawing the bone.
Another defining property of Ik subordinate clauses is that all core
arguments (A/S/O) are marked with the accusative case. Again, this is
similar to Tennet, where main clauses have a nominative-accusative casemarking system, while in dependent clauses, this switches to ergativeabsolutive (Dimmendaal 2010:33). Also in this connection, the Saharan
language Tubu, which has Differential Object Marking, an object is more
likely to be marked accusative if not expressed in its normal position (König4952008:40, cited in Dimmendaal 2010:32). In other words, accusative case is
reserved for pragmatically marked positions. So in Ik, the accusative
marking on subjects (A/S) may have something to do with the subject being
in a pragmatically marked slot, that is, before the verb. The next two
examples illustrate this with intransitive (80) and transitive (81) clauses:
(80)Noo ncia epiaade kuru,...

The type of case-marking neutralization exhibited in (80)-(81) violates
König’s typological prediction #7 for African languages with case: “If the
language is verb-initial or verb-medial, then the ‘no case before the verb’
rule applies” (2008:281). The Surmic language Tennet, spoken not far from
Ik in South Sudan, also violates this prediction, but only partially. But as
hinted at above, normal case marking is retained in Ik subordinate clauses
with sequential aspect verb forms. Note that in the following example, all
core arguments bear the nominative case suffix (including the object):

"6.3.3 Instrumental
The instrumental case suffix {-ɔ} may have an areal parallel in the South
Omotic language Dime’s locative suffix -ó (Mulugeta 2008:55)—no other
possible links have been identified. Regardless, the Ik suffix has L tone but
may take a H projected by the noun stem’s melody. It is a recessive suffix
harmonizable to /-o/ by a [+ATR] stem. Like the nominative, it deletes the
noun stem’s final vowel. Before a pause, the instrumental suffix is devoiced
to /-ᵓ/ or /-ᵒ/. And in these final form allomorphs, it may be reduced257phonetically to mere labialization on the stem-final consonant (especially
nasals). Often, the labialization is not audible at all but only visible.
An interesting further trait of the instrumental suffix is that, while it is
devoiced before a pause, it is never deleted. Even if devoiced, it minimally
leaves a trace of labialization. So this is an example where the grammar
overrides its tendency to delete devoiced vowels for the sake of meaning.
For if {-ɔ} was allowed to be deleted, it would be ambiguous with the
nominative case suffix which may be fully deleted. The following table
shows the presence of the suffix, irrespective of the preceding consonant:

argument expressing any of the following six semantic roles:
(71)Instrumental case semantic roles
1Instrument/Means2Path3Comitative4Manner5Time6Occupative Aspect258First, the instrumental case is used to encode peripheral arguments that
denote an Instrument or Means by which an action is realized. The
following two sentences illustrate this specifically ‘instrumental’ case role:
(72)Kokese akina makulik.
kɔk-ɛsɛak-ɪn-amakúl-ík-ᵒclose-SPSmouth-POSS.PL-NOM grass.over-PL-INSAnd its openings were closed with grass covers.
(73)Taa buƙa noo bia ino tana?
taabuƙ-a=noobi-aín-ótaná-∅QUOTmarry-REAL=PST 3you-ACCanimal-INS how.many-REALSo he married you with how many animals?
A culturally relevant usage of the instrumental case to encode the Means
role involves the verb bɪ́r-ɛ́s ‘to avail, assist with’. In Ik collective society,
one is expected to share any acquired resources, from snuff tobacco to meat
to clothing to water, etc. The preferred phrase used to acquire assets from
another person is constructed with the formula bɪ́rɛ́ NP[OBL] NP-INS, in other
words “Assist me/us with X.” A couple of examples will suffice:
(74)Bire nci cwo.
bɪ ́r-ɛ́ɲ́cicu-ᵒassist-IMP.SGI[OBL] water-INS‘Assist me with water (or ‘Give me water.’).
(75)Biroo ngo nƙaƙ.
bɪ ́r-ɔ́ɔŋɡoŋƙáƙ-ᵒassist-IMP.PLwe.EXC[OBL]food-INS‘Assist us with food (or ‘Give us food.’).
When requests like the one in (74) are made, the peripheral argument may
be dropped. This formulaic request is so often used it is typically259phonetically reduced to something like [brɪ ́ɲc̚]. Such a reduced surface
form seems to have given rise to the phrase brinji lotop ‘Give me tobacco’ of
Colin Turnbull’s fame (1972:299). His phrase can actually be parsed as:
(76)“Brinji lotop.”
bɪ ́r-ɛ́ɲ́cilɔ́tɔ́ɓ-ᵓ→assist-IMP.SGI[OBL] tobacco-INS[brɪ ́ɲtʃi ̥ lɔ́t ɔ́ɓ̥̚ ]‘Assist me with tobacco (or ‘Give me tobacco.’).
Second, the instrumental case is used to encode peripheral arguments that
denote a Path: a place by or through which a motion or action is realized:
(77)Atsimaa sabo didik.
ats-ima-asab-odidi-kᵉcome-1PL.EXC-SEQriver-INSup- DATAnd we came up by way of the river.
(78)Ŋatiini awoo xaino gai.
ŋat-í-íniawó-óʃa-in-oꜜɡáírun-PLUR-SEQhome-ABLdirection-POSS.PL-INSbothAnd they ran from the home by way of both directions.
Thirdly, the instrumental case is used to encode peripheral arguments that
denote an entity with which an agent goes somewhere. This role is
‘instrumental’ in that the agent takes an object somewhere by the hand to
thereby achieve some goal. This case role is most common with inanimate
objects or animate entities that have little control over the event. The
following two sentences show this Comitative role of the instrumental case:
(79)Ƙoyaa naa kuruɓad.
ƙó-í-a=naakúrúɓád-ᵒgo-1SG-REAL=PST1 things-INS
I went with (my) things.","[288, 289, 290, 291]"
"129[ƙaátanaamuɲu]The third intonational pattern, called the solicitive tune, is used to solicit
agreement from the hearer. It is often heard in the following contexts: 1)
making polite requests or gentle commands, 2) making statements subject to
the hearer’s approval, and 3) ensuring the hearer’s attention. The solicitive
tune can apply to both main clauses and subordinate clauses (even ones
preceding the main clauses of declarative statements or questions.)
The solicitive tune is marked by a low-rising (LH) boundary tone. Unlike the
indicative and interrogative tunes, the final morpheme of a clause can
appear in either its non-final or final form. When the final form occurs,
vowels normally devoiced surface as voiced so as to link to the low-rising
tone to a tone-bearing unit. But because a) the LH boundary tone applies
only to the clauses’s final vowel and b) contour tones in Ik must link to two
phonological TBUs, the final vowel is doubled for the solicitive tune:

[ƙaátanaamuɲuú]4 Nouns
As one of language’s ‘evolutionary primitives’ (Heine & Kuteva 2007:59),
nouns comprise one of Ik’s two large open word classes (the other being
verbs). The present chapter begins with an overview of noun roots (§4.1)
moving on then to nominal suffixes (§4.2), compounds (§4.3), and several
types of onomastics (§4.4.-§4.5). Case marking, a crucial feature of the
nominal system, is treated in Chapter 6 on the way to the wider grammar.
In Ik, a noun is any word whose primary function is to be the head of a
noun phrase, which in turn functions as an argument of a verb. As the head
of a noun phrase, a noun must be inflected for case to show its relation to
other words. It may also take other nominal suffixes and may be joined to
another noun or pronoun in a compound construction. A second function of
an Ik noun is to be the head of the predicate. To fulfil this function, a noun
must take the copulative case marker (§6.3.8), which is the functional
equivalent of a copula and allows the noun to stand alone as a sentence.
Semantically, the prototypical Ik noun refers to inanimate and animate
objects, people, and places—anything in the world that is viewed as an
inherent non-event. However, the boundary between things named by
nouns and events named by verbs is fuzzy. Many lexical event concepts can
become nouns with noun morphology or verbs with verb morphology, e.g.:
(1)Lexemes ambiguously nominal or verbal
botá-‘migrate’ƙɔ́ɗɛ́-‘cry’cooka-‘shepherd’ɔfa-‘cough’deƙu-‘quarrel’sáɡo-‘snare’ɗɔanɪ ́-‘weed’sʊpa-‘breathe’epú-‘sleep’taatsa-‘pay’féí-‘bathe’taʝala-‘give up’132fekí-‘laugh’tɔkɔba-‘farm’ɪ ̯ana-‘talk’tɔkɔra-‘distribute’ɪƙɪra-‘write’tɔlɔka-‘trap’ɪrɛʝa-‘slash grass’tɛwɛa-‘broadcast seed’iruɓa-‘chew hard foods’tóda-‘speak’isira-‘decorate’tsuwaa-‘run’ɪtsɪka-‘order’wáána-‘pray’ɪwara-‘plaster’waté-‘rain’ƙaƙa-‘hunt’zɛƙɔ́-‘sit/stay’Ik nominal morphology is minimal—four being the maximum number of
morphemes a single noun can have (outside of compounds). Compare this to
Turkana nouns which may have up to eleven morphemes (Dimmendaal
1983:208)ǃ Any Ik noun in a post-lexical grammatical context consists
minimally of a lexical root plus a case marker. Besides the case marker, the
only other nominal suffixes are number and possession markers. The order
in which these occur is ROOT-(NUMBER)-(POSSESSION)- CASE. Unlike Turkana
and Dhaasanac, Ik has no grammatical gender marked on nouns. Ik
compensates for its minimal noun inflection by joining nouns and pronouns
together in a variety of compounds. Thus, meanings expressed by affixes in
other languages are expressed by a compound construction in Ik.
In their basic underlying forms, every Ik nominal root and suffix ends in a
vowel, without exception. This final vowel is unpredictable since it can be
any of the language’s nine contrastive vowels. Because of this, these final
vowels are treated universally as part of the root in Ik. Similar ‘terminal
vowels’ in the East Cushitic Dhaasanac are only viewed as part of the stem
in some cases where they “are by and large meaningless elements…[maybe]
ancient desemanticized gender markers” (Tosco 2001:65). And like the
Omotic language Dime (Mulugeta 2008), Ik has some nouns whose rootfinal vowel has two free variants, e.g. kɔlá~kɔlɛ́- ‘goat’ and zɪná~zɪnɔ́‘zebra’. Such cases seem to arise along the lines of chronolects and idiolects.","[160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"
"275The claim is that objects that have a more prototypical Patient role are more
likely to be marked differently (e.g. with an accusative case) than those
without it. Since prototypical Patients are [-volitional], and since volition
implies animacy, it is claimed that objects further down the cline toward
inanimacy are more likely to be marked differentially (Dimm. 2010:39).
The concept of prototypical transitivity seems applicable to Ik splitaccusativity, but along slightly different lines. In Ik, volition, instigation,
affectedness, and animacy alone do not determine whether an object will be
marked with the accusative case or nominative case. By contrast, the only
relevant factor is whether the Agent of a transitive clause is present in the
conversation, i.e. is a speech-act participant (3 person). If the Agent
(animate or inanimate) is not speaker or addressee, then the object must
take the accusative case. Thus, taking Ik into account, the feature
[±participant] can be added to Næss’ definition of prototypical transitivity.
An Agent that is not a speech-act participant (3 person) embodies a greater
degree of transitivity because its intention (if animate) or capability (if
inanimate) is inaccessible and therefore not knowable or assessable. This
puts greater semantic ‘distance’ between the Agent and Patient than if the
Agent was a speech-act particpant who could be negotiated with. This, then,
is one further attempt to make sense of Ik’s person-based split-accusativity.
Another question relevant to the Ik accusative case is what semantic roles
the object of a transitive clause can take. This question applies to transitive
objects generally, including those marked in the nominative case. Ik direct
objects encode the expected semantic role of Patient, but they can also
encode Direction and/or Purpose. Three Ik verbs of motion—ats- ‘come’, ƙa‘go’, and ɪtá- ‘reach’—are unusual in that they can behave like transitive
verbs. Similar motion-verb properties have been reported as common in
Cushitic and Omotic languages (Dimmendaal 2003:100). Old Nubian is
reported to have marked Patients and Directions with the suffix -ka, while
the Semitic language Tigrinya uses its accusative prefix ni-/nä- to mark
Patients, Directions, and many other roles (Dimmendaal 2010:41).","[306, 307]"
"6 Case
The description of Ik ‘case’ is placed here between nouns and verbs because
as a meta-categorial system, it applies to both these major word classes.
Case is the backbone of Ik grammar. It permeates nearly every grammatical
subsystem, such that a good grasp of it is key to knowing the language.
Thus, beyond giving an overview of the case system (§6.1), this chapter’s
aim is to lay out the details of case in the nominal system (§6.2-6.3) and
grammaticalized ‘case’ in other systems, particularly that of verbs (§6.4).
As far as case languages in Africa go, Ik is a magnificent specimen. The
following artificially elicited (but fully grammatical) sentence illustrates this
by making use of all eight morphological cases: Nominative1, Copulative2,
Accusative3, Ablative4, Dative5, Genitive6, Instrumental7, and Oblique8:(1)Benia ntsa amoo noo cea inwaa

A complex sentence like this one embodies the language’s full-fledged
morphological case-marking system. In addition to word order and
connectives like ńda ‘with’, Ik uses this case system to mark grammatical
relations and encode semantic roles in an integral and efficient manner.","[261, 262, 263]"
"In (43), the S of the first clause (ŋkᵃ) becomes the O of the second clause
(ɲ́ cikᵃ). This is reflected in the case-marking change from the nominative in
the first clause to the accusative in the second (due to the fact that 3rd
person agents in Ik always take direct objects in the accusative case).
For transitive verbs, the original transitive agent (A) becomes the direct
object (O) of the new agentive causer which is now (A). And the original
direct object becomes an extended object (E) marked with the dative case:
(44)Ŋabia nka ɲokoti.

ŋáb-it-i-et-a[ɲ́ci-a]O[ɲókótií-kᵉ]Ewear-CAUS-PLUR-INCH-REALI-ACCcoat-DATHe makes me wear a coat.
Lastly, for extended transitive verbs, the original transitive subject (A)
becomes the direct object (O), while the original direct object becomes the484first extended object (E1) marked with the dative case. And the original
extended object (E1) becomes the second extended object (E2), also in the
dative case. This construction puts Ik in the company of the relatively few
languages worldwide—like Japanese, Turkish, and Kamaiurá—that allow
more than one dative noun phrase in the same clause (Dixon 2012:264):
(46)Maƙotiaa nka kaudza konie amae.

"6.2.2 Case origins
The precise origin of the Ik case suffixes is not known, but a clue may come
from how they affix to nominal stems. As noted earlier, the case suffixes can
be grouped according to their suffixation ‘strategy’—subtracting or
preserving the stem-final vowel. These different suffixation strategies may
point to two different origins for the suffixes. Ik syllable structure does not
allow consonant clusters, so those case suffixes that begin with /k/
(accusative {-ka}, dative {-kɛ}, and copulative {-kɔ}) require the stem-final
vowel to remain to prevent a CC sequence. It seems likely, then, that the
ablative {-ɔ} and genitive {-ɛ} may have once contained a consonant as
well, since they preserve the stem-final vowel. The nominative {-a} and
instrumental {-ɔ} suffixes, though, seem to have originated as single vowels
since they do not require the stem-final vowel to break up a CC sequence.
In terms of ultimate origin, according to Heine & Kuteva, there are three
known pathways for the evolution of case markers (2007:62, 75, 91):244(30)Evolutionary pathways for case markers
1Noun > (adposition) > case marker2Verb > case marker3Adposition > case markerAs a working hypothesis, Ik case markers may have originated from N1 -N2
compounds where the N2 first desemanticized slightly to become an
adposition. The adposition (postposition) then desemanticized further and
eroded phonetically to become the language’s present-day case morphemes.
Even today, compounding is the language’s primary nominal word-building
mechanism (see §4.3.). Lexical compounds join nouns to nouns, as in:
(31)Lexical compounds
bɛfá-cɛ́mɛ́r‘Cissus rhodesiae herb’(puff adder-herb)aká-kwáᶦ‘lip’(mouth-edge)ɗiɗe-ŋwa‘female donkey’(donkey-female)lɛra-aƙwᵃ‘White-Thorn place’(White Thorn-inside)wáána-ho‘church’(prayer-hut)In principle, any noun in the language can be a compound’s N2 (though not
all will be semantically acceptable), but a smaller subset of nouns are more
productive and seem to be in the process of shifting from the status of full
nouns to nominal adpositions or even suffixes. They include the following:
(32)Grammaticalizing compound N2s

"2896.4‘Case’ and grammaticalizationFormal parallels or homophones of the nominal case suffixes are found in
other subsystems of Ik grammar. These are most richly attested in the verbal
system (§6.4.1), though they are also found on demonstratives, relative
pronouns, and tense particles (§6.4.2). This homophony has led to claims
that Ik case is marked on ‘conjunctions, postpositions, prepositions, adverbs,
and even verbs’ (König 2008:81). But this is misleading because most of
these word classes are really nouns or verbs in Ik. The notion that nominal
case suffixes grammaticalized into verbal inflectional affixes is one of the
key claims of König 2002. Using her methodology, Schrock 2013 traces out
several other potential grammaticalization pathways going from nominal
case suffix to verbal affix. The picture emerging from this work is that due
to its near ubiquity, ‘case’ is a unifying structural element in the language.
Unless the traditional definition of case is revised to include functors outside
the nominal system, it is useful to speak of ‘case’ and ‘Case’ in Ik. The
former is a way the language encodes grammatical relations, and the latter
is a meta-categorial or mono-systemic archi-morphology whose precise
origin and path of grammaticalization is not always known. In some
instances, there is a demonstrable semantic link between a form in one
system and its parallel in another, but in other instances, there is not.
Up to now it seems to have been assumed in the literature that nominal case
suffixes are prior, being the source of parallels found elsewhere. A less
explored but equally possible scenario is that all the various formal parallels
in the different subsystems all come from a yet undiscovered source. Until
much more descriptive and historical-comparative work is done in the Horn
of Africa, the origin of these morphological types may remain out of sight.","[320, 321]"
"6.3.1 Oblique
The oblique case is the only zero-marked (Ø) case in Ik. As such, it
segmentally mirrors a noun’s basic underlying lexical form. But in their nonfinal forms, nouns with a tone melody LH surface as LL. That is, tone may
minorly distinguish the oblique case from the lexical base of some nouns. In
the oblique case, stem-final vowels are devoiced or deleted before a pause.
The paradigm for oblique, as well as those for the other cases, show nine
nouns each ending with one of the language’s nine contrastive vowels:

Oblique must be maintained as a proper case of its own. This is because it is
required for specific, unique grammatical relations and semantic roles.
The Ik oblique case marks out the following seven grammatical functions:

"2055.1.2 Personal possessive pronouns
Ik has no other personal possessive pronouns than those presented in (1).
Possession is expressed in two ways through those personal pronouns: 1)
The first way is to mark possession by putting the pronoun (PRO) in the
genitive case as an NP modifier, following the possessum NP head. 2) The
second way is to put the pronoun in the oblique case as the first element in
a possessive compound. Both ways are illustrated below. No semantic
difference is known to exist between the two, though pragmatic, discursive
or rhythmic preferences may lead a speaker to chose one over the other.

An emphatic pronominal compound can be formed by combining any of the
personal pronouns with the words nébu- ‘body’ or nébitíní- ‘bodies’. Such
compounds draw special emphasis to the person referenced by the pronoun.
Although these compounds are glossed in English as ‘-self/selves’, they do
not have a reflexive meaning. Reflexivity in Ik is expressed by the pronoun
asɪ́- which is covered below in §5.7. The paradigm of emphatic pronominal
compounds for all person and numbers is presented in (6):206(6)Emphatic pronominal compounds
ɲ́ci-nebu-‘myself’bi-nébu-‘yourself’ntsí-nébu-‘his/herself’ŋɡó-néb-itíní-‘ourselves (EXC)’ɲjíní-neb-itíní-‘ourselves (INC)’biti-neb-itíní-‘yourselves’ńtí-neb-itíní-‘themselves’In the following example, the Emphatic compound ɲ́ ci-nebᵒ ‘with my body’
emphasizes the fact that it is ‘I’ who am going, not you, or anyone else. The
context may be that the addressee or someone else had refused to go:
(7)Ƙeesia ncineb.
ƙe-es-í-áɲ́ci-neb-ᵒgo-INT-1SG-REAL I[OBL]-body-INS
I will go myself (with my own body)ǃ
Although usually formed with personal pronouns, emphatic compounds may
also involve full nouns. In the following example, the compound roɓanebitíní ‘people themselves (people-bodies)’ adds a certain degree of finality
and/or concreteness to the fact of people dying:
(8)Naƙwaa riyee nda roɓanebitini tsʼeatik.

"475From a syntactic point of view, Ik employs three types of possessive
construction: 1) A possessee NP head followed by a possessor NP in the
genitive case, 2) a possessor noun and a possessee noun joined in a
compound, in that order. Ik speakers claim there is no difference in meaning
between these two types. 3) The third type of possessive construction is
complex. It consists of a compound with the possessor as the N1 and the
possessum morpheme ɛnɪ ́- as the N2. These two elements alone comprise a
possessive noun phrase, as in ɲj-ɛ́n ‘mine’. But then the possessee can be
specified by putting it in a genitive phrase after the NP head. This
construction can be termed ‘pertensive’ (Dixon 2010b:268), given that the
possessee bears the traditional marking for possessor (the genitive case):

1awa ɲ́cihome I:GEN‘my home’2ɲ́ci-awI:OBL-home‘my home’3ɲj-ɛ́ná awáᵉI[OBL]-PSSM home:GEN‘my home’The types of semantic relationships that Ik possessive constructions can
express include those in (15)-(21). According to Dixon (2012b:263), Ik
would fall into that group of languages worldwide that shows a
comparatively wide range of such relationships:
(15)Ownership:nƙaƙa nti

(21)Nominalization:arutetona ebae

Ik also uses verbal means to express possession. For example, the verbs tír-és
‘to hold’, i-on ‘to be’, and i-ona ńda ‘to be with’ are all common verbal
alternatives alongside the NP possessive constructions in (14). These verbs
used in this way often translate as ‘to have’. The first, tír-és, is a transitive
verb whose subject would be the possessor and object the possessee. Due to
its high degree of agency, this verb is restricted to human possessors:477(22)Tirida ɲakalama?
tír-íd-aɲákalám-ahold-2SG-REALpen-NOMDo you have a pen (lit. ‘Are you holding a pen’)?
(23)Biraa koroɓaa tiri.
bɪra-akɔ́rɔ́ɓá-atír-í-∅not.be-REAL thing-NOM hold-1SG-REAL
I have nothing (lit. ‘There is nothing I am holding’).
The second ‘have’-verb—i-on ‘to be’—is the language’s locative/existential
copular verb. Used in a possessive way, this verb takes the possessee as its
subject and the possessor as a peripheral argument in the dative case, e.g.:
(24)Iya ɲakalama ncik.
i-aɲákalám-a ɲci-kᵉbe-REAL pen-NOMI-DATI have a pen (lit. ‘There is a pen to me’).
To negate the kind of possessive clause in (24), one has to substitute the
negative locative copula (bɪrá- ‘not be there’) and put the possessor (or more
precisely, the ‘un-possessor’) in the ablative case:
(25)Biraa ɲakalama ncu.
bɪra-aɲákalám-a ɲcu-∅not.be-REAL pen-NOMI-ABLI have no pen (lit. ‘A pen lacks from me’).
The third verb, i-ona ńda ‘to be with’, combines the locative/existential
copula i- with the preposition ńda ‘and/with’. The possessor is the subject of
the verb, and the possessee is a peripheral argument in the oblique case.
When negated with the verb bɪrá- ‘lack’ the oblique-case possessee is marked
on the subordinated verb i- ‘be’ with the dummy pronoun enclitic {=ˊdɛ}:478(26)Iyida nda ɲakalamu?
i-íd-ańꜜdaɲákalámʊbe-2SG-REALwithpen[OBL]Do you have a pen (lit. ‘Are you with a pen’)?
(27)Biraa ɲakalama iyiaad.
bɪra-aɲákalám-a i-í-á=dᵉnot.be-REAL pen-NOMbe-1SG-REAL=DPI don’t have a pen (lit. ‘A pen is lacking that I am with’).
The Teso-Turkana languages bordering Ik, like Karimojong and Turkana,
also convey possession by means of locative/existential copulae. In the
following examples (from Mantovani 1963:9, though morpheme glosses are
my own), the verb ayakau ‘to be (there)’ has the meaning of ‘to have’:
(28)Eyai iyong aite.
eyaííyoŋbe:3SG you:DATáite
cowYou have a cow (lit. ‘A cow is to you’).
(29)Eyakasi iyong ngaatuk.
eyakási íyoŋŋáâtukbe:3PL you:DATcowsYou have cows (lit. ‘Cows are to you’).","[506, 507, 508, 509, 510]"
"288(172)beni-áɗ-a CS/CC?ɲjíní-enot.be-REAL one.SG-NOM we.INC-GEN
Is it not (the one of) ours?
In closing, the question must be asked: Is the Ik ‘copulative’ really a case?
As mentioned above, Cushitic parallels for the Ik copulative case suffix {-kɔ}
are analyzed variously as suffixes, clitics and ‘markers’ more generally. In
strictly morphological terms, the morpheme {-kɔ} certainly patterns like all
the other Ik case suffixes: 1) It has an identical segmental shape as that of
the dative and accusative cases, 2) it undergoes identical morphophonological alternations as the others suffixes, and 3) it fills the same
nominal suffixal position as the other case suffixes. Then in syntactic terms,
it patterns with other cases in that it is required to mark a unique argument
(complement) in a specific clause type: a negative copula of identity clause.
Thus it is analyzed in this grammar as a ‘case’ proper, synchronically.
Nevertheless, the copulative case has some peculiar properties that set it
apart from all the other cases. First, apart from its function in marking a
copular complement, the copulative does not encode grammatical relations
of a noun with a predicate or a noun with another noun in a noun phrase.
When it marks a noun, either in a cleft-construction or in a verbless copula
clause, the noun fills the predicate slot. In that position, the noun with the
copulative suffix can be followed by adverbial and tense-marking enclitics
that otherwise come directly after true verbs. So in this sense, the copulative
has a function more characteristic of a verbal morpheme.
Asdiscussedbelowin§6.4.1,Könighastracedachainofgrammaticalization from an old focus marker (cf. the Cushitic parallels) to
both the copulative suffix in the nominal system and the sequential aspect
marker in the verbal system (2002:349-361). And so it would seem that the
Ik copulative case shows the traits of a transitional form between a nominal
and verbal morpheme. This might help explain its cross-categorial behavior.","[319, 320]"
"5209.10.2 Verbless dative/genitive clause
A second type of verbless clause communicates possession without the
benefit of an actual verb in the surface structure. This construction has also
been termed ‘predicative possessive’ (Heine & König 1996:50). It is called
‘dative/genitive’ here because it is not known which case suffix it involves.
That is, in their non-final forms, the dative suffix {-ɛ} and genitive suffix
{-ɛ} are identical. And since verbless clauses of this type have to do with
possession, either case is theoretically admissible (see discussion in §9.2).
Verbless dative/genitive clauses have a different underlying structure than
verbless copulative clauses. Whereas in the latter type, a nominal element
functions as the predicate, verbless dative/genitive clauses manifest no overt
predicate at all. So rather than being ‘verbless’ in the sense that something
other than a verb fills the predicate slot, they are ‘verbless’ in the sense that
there is no predicate on the surface. In the following examples, nouns
marked with {-ɛ} come clause-initially. Either a dative or genitive
intepretation of {-ɛ} is possible because both can encode possession:
(148)Ncie ŋoka na.
ɲ́ci-eŋók-á=naI-DAT/GENdog-NOM=DEM.SGThis is my dog.
(149)Roɓee kuruɓaa ni.
roɓe-ekúrúɓá-a=nipeople-DAT /GEN things-NOM=DEM.PL
These are people’s things.
Depending on the analysis of the case marker {-ɛ}, ɲ́cie in (148) could mean
‘to me’ or ‘of me’, and roɓee in (149) could mean ‘to people’ or ‘of people’.","[551, 552]"
"209In combination with a personal pronoun, the impersonal possessum is
roughly equivalent in translation to the independent English possessive
pronouns, like ‘mine’, ‘yours’, ‘its’, as in:
(9)Ik impersonal possessum pronoun
ɲj-ɛ́nɪ ́-‘mine’bi-ɛ́nɪ ́-‘yours (sg.)’nts-ɛ́nɪ ́-‘his/hers/its’ŋɡó-ɛ́nɪ ́-‘ours (exc.)’ɲjíní-ɛnɪ-‘ours (inc.)’biti-ɛnɪ ́-‘yours (pl.)’ńtí-ɛnɪ-‘theirs’The tone of -ɛnɪ́- changes according to the melody of the compound’s N1. But
because it is in a compound, the dominant [+ATR] value of the N1 does not
spread across the morpheme boundary. The impersonal possessum is
analyzed as an N2 instead of a suffix because, as a general rule: a) It does
not alter the tone of the N1, b) it does not delete the final vowel of the N1,
and c) is it not harmonized for [ATR] by the N1. Nevertheless, it remains
somewhat of a hybrid between suffix and N2 in that: a) It accompanies a
tone change of the N1 in the case of the 1SG (ɲ́ ci- → ɲjˊ-) and b) it deletes the
final vowel of the 1SG and 3SG N2 pronouns (ɲ́ ci- → ɲjˊ- and ntsí- → ntsˊ-).
The impersonal possessum pronominal also combines with full nouns, as in:
(10)Impersonal possessum with nouns/nominalized verbs

pronouns are bimorphemic or compounds. The first four in the table are
formed on the basis of kɔnɪ́- ‘some, another’ which is related to the verb kɔn‘be one’. The next three are based on kíní- ‘some (pl.)’, the plural
counterpart to kɔnɪ́-. The last pronoun in the table (saí-) is the only free form
apart from kɔnɪ ́-. All these indefinite pronouns can a) be fully inflected for
case, and b) some can occur with or without explicit nominal complements.

quantifier muɲu, as in ódowa muɲᵘ ‘any day’.
Four of the eight pronouns listed in (11) can occur with or without a
nominal complement. These are kɔnɪ́-, kɔ́nɪ́-ɛ́nɪ́-, kíní-ɛ́nɪ́-, and saí-. The other
four do not take complements because, as compounds, they already contain
a head and modifier (with the exception of kɔ́n-ɔ́ma-, which because of its
morphological structure, must be analyzed as a singulative form):
(12)Atsaa kon.

"276The following sentences are examples of a) Ik motion verbs functioning as
transitive verbs and b) object case (NOM or ACC) marking Direction/Purpose:
(130)Atsaa ƙanesia kuruɓadie ntsi.
ats-á-áƙan-ésí-aOkúrúɓádi-e ntsí-∅come- REAL-PRF get-INF-ACC things-GEN he-GEN

soonHe’ll reach Kaabong soon.
In none of the preceding three sentences would the dative case be
grammatical on the direct object (O) encoding Direction and/or Purpose.
These examples are interesting in that the dative case (next section) is used
more generally to encode both Purpose and Goal/Direction. It is only the
unique combination of these roles that transitivize the verb and objects.
Back to the grammatical functions of the accusative: Its second function is to
mark the overt subject (A/S) of any subordinate clause (except those with
sequential verb forms). In many subordinate clauses, the subject may be left
implicit, though it is always cross-referenced on the verb. When the subject
of a subordinate clause is explicit, it comes before the verb, as opposed to
after the verb like unmarked main clauses. Turkana is also a VSO language.
And it also marks its preverbal subjects with object case, which for it is the
‘absolutive’, the equivalent of the Ik accusative (Dimmendaal 1983:260).","[307, 308]"
"277The next three sentences below illustrate the accusative case marking and
preverbal syntactic position of subordinate clause subjects (A/S):

The dative case suffix has the form {-kɛ}. Potential areal parallels for it
include the Cushitic language Saho’s goal/source marker -k (Banti & Vergari
2005:14) and the Dhaasanac ‘core adposition’ -(k)i that encodes dative,
benefactive, and instrumental roles (Tosco 2001:232).
The Ik dative suffix has L tone but can take a H tone spread from the
preceding stem (T7). It is a recessive suffix with the [+ATR] allophone
/-ke/ after [+ATR] stems. In terms of suffixation strategy, the dative suffix
preserves the stem-final vowel, ostensibly to avoid a disallowed CC cluster.
Before a pause, the dative suffix is reduced to /-kᵋ/ or /-k̚/, and its clausemedial allomorph, losing the /k/, has the form /-ɛ/ or /-e/. If the stem-final
vowel is /a/, /ɪ/ or /ɔ/, it may be totally assimilated by the dative suffix.
And if the final vowel of a stem is a high back vowel, it may desyllabify and
cause the dative suffix to lengthen in compensation:

arguments that most prototypically encode a Goal for motion or action
verbs and Location for static verbs. These have literal and more
metaphorical applications as evidenced by the following seven roles:279(139)Dative case semantic roles
1Recipient/Benefactor2Experiencer3Destination/Goal4Location5Possessor6Purpose7Second object of the causativeFirst, the dative marks peripheral arguments that encode an entity receiving
something from an Agent. This includes Recipients and Benefactors, e.g.:

Second, the dative marks peripheral arguments that encode an Experiencer
receiving something from a Stimulus, for example with verbs of speech:
(142)Kutini naɓo ntsie,…
kʊt-ɪnɪ naɓóntsí-ésay-SEQ againhe-DATAnd they said again to him,...
Third, the dative case in Ik is to mark peripheral arguments that encode the
Destination or Goal of an action or motion, as for example in:280(143)Ɓuƙotio honesiika riʝaaƙok.

The preposition ńꜜda ‘and/with’ is often used elsewhere as a connective to
join whole independent clauses (see §10.1.10. But the following examples
show it preposed to nouns or noun phrases taking the oblique case:

In some instances, though, a noun in another case other than the oblique
can be found after ńꜜda. This happens when a verb ‘sees through’ ńꜜda to
assign a case role. In the following example, the verb eɡini assigns the dative
case to mark its conjoined complex indirect object (with a Goal role):

"441The whole system of the first set of Ik locative demonstratives is apparently
based on the noun aí- ‘location, side’. This noun, combined with the
nominal spatial demonstratives, produces a system of locative reference that
shows various degrees of grammaticalization and phonological erosion.
Because the noun aí- ‘location, side’ is at the heart of this system, in
principle all members of the paradigm should inflect for all eight Ik nominal
cases. In reality, though, some of the case suffixes have been lexicalized as
part of the noun base and substantially eroded, resulting in case conflation.
(35) shows the synchronic system of locative demonstratives, their
hypothetical diachronic development being discussed below:
(35)Deictic locative adverbial demonstratives (Set 1)

aí- plus the proximal demonstrative na= as a proclitic. The same
demonstrative is then an optional enclitic for the proximal forms, while the
medial demonstrative =ne is an optional enclitic for the medial forms. The
proclitic nɑ= has apparently undergone phonological reduction. Then, once
nɑ= and aí- were conflated into naí-, it became subject to vowel
assimilation. In the instrumental case, marked by the suffix {-ɔ}, the
resulting form is nóó. This vowel assimilation is expected since the
instrumental case deletes the stem-final vowel. However, in the genitive and442dative cases, both of which are marked with the suffix {-(k)ɛ}, the resulting
form is néé. This form involves further phonological reduction:
(36)Instrumental:na= +aí-+-ɔ ͏ → nóóGenitive/dative:na= +aí-+-ɛ → naí-é→ nééAs for the distal locative demonstrative, it appears to have undergone
grammaticalization and phonological reduction to the point that it has the
same form in all nominal cases: kɔ́ɔ=
́ (kɛ). In years past, the distal locative
demonstrative comprised a regular part of the paradigm in which the noun
aí- was flanked on both sides by the distal nominal demonstrative kɛ, as in
ke=aí-é=ke, for example, in the genitive and dative cases. At some point,
the preceding ke= merged with the base noun, and at a later point, the
instrumental case form kɔ́-ɔ́ was substituted for all the cases. Since it has
undergone phonological reduction and morphological conflation to this
degree, the form kɔ́ɔ́ is analyzed here as a single morpheme synchronically.
Ik also has plural locative adverbial demonstratives: nií- for proximal and
medial and kií- for distal. If the diachronic analysis of the forms in (35) is
correct, then it would seem these plural forms were created by analogy with
the demonstratives na (sg.)∼ ni (pl.) for proximal/medial and kɛ (sg.) ∼ ki
(pl.) for distal. These plural locative demonstratives pattern as follows:

In this function, ʃáná- is preceded by a proclitic
demonstrative and followed optionally by another demonstrative. These
locative demonstratives can be proximal or distal, as shown in (38). In the
distal column, the /e/ in the distal demonstrative ke has been shortened to
/i/ in ki= as a result of it being in an unstressed position:

locations or directions. These may correspond to their absolute navigational
referents, but they are often skewed somewhat by local topography:

EastFetí-éku-ʃaná-‘sun-eye-direction’WestTábai-ʃaná-‘?-direction’NorthGwário-ʃaná‘top-direction’SouthGíɡiro-ʃaná-‘down-direction’Finally, the words nédi- (medial) and kédi- (distal) also function as locative
adverbial demonstratives. Because kédi- has the lexical meaning of ‘way,
means’ and nédi- has none such, it suspected that nédi- was introduced by
analogy with the deictic demonstratives ne (medial) and ke (distal). As full
nouns, they make up a fully regular case paradigm as shown in (40):444(40)Deictic locatives (Set 3)

also has two anaphoric locative demonstratives: tʊmɛꜜdɛ́- and tsʼɛ́ꜜdɛ́-. The
downstep posited for both forms is based on the fact that the H tone after
the depressor consonant /d/ is lowered to mid pitch (actually a low-to-mid
rise phonetically). As mentioned in §3.2.3, this is typical tonal behavior
whenever a depressor consonant is followed or flanked by H tones.

/d/ suggests that they are linked formally as well as functionally with the
anaphoric nominal demonstrative =dꜜɛ́ɛ ́ described above (as well as the
singular possessive suffix -ɛdɛ-). The demonstrative tsʼɛ́ꜜdɛ́- has two445frequently encountered allomorphs varying in the first segment: ʝɛ́ꜜdɛ́- and
ƙɛ́ꜜdɛ́- and. This type of glottalic allophony is described back in §2.3.3.
The two anaphoric locative demonstratives are close in meaning and
function in that they both refere anaphorically to a previously mentioned
place, whether near or far away. However, though tʊmɛꜜdɛ́- can refer only to
physical locations, tsʼɛ́ꜜdɛ́- can also refer metaphorically to circumstantial
and even temporal ‘locations’, giving it a slightly broader usage.
In (42) below, tʊmɛꜜdɛ́- is used twice to refer back to the location ‘Usake’,
marked with the dative case. Note the different case endings on the
demonstrative according to which case the clause’s syntax requires:

The Ik plurative I {-íkó-} is found pluralizing both monomoraic and
polymoraic nominal stems. It is not productive: The nouns it pluralizes
belong to a fixed lexical set that, as far as can be observed, does not admit
new members. The plurative I seems to be a parallel of the Turkana
pluralizer -íyó (Dimmendaal 1983:235), which if true, would suggest that
the intervocalic /k/ was retained in Ik and lost in Turkana.
In both languages, these suffixes are dominantly [+ATR]. For Ik, this means
that the [+ATR] harmony spreads leftward to the whole stem unless /a/
intervenes. In this case, the /a/ is an instance of the frozen singulative -á(t)
(see ex. 31 above). The plurative I causes and undergoes tonal alternations.
The tone changes it causes are due to replacive morphological tone, and the
changes it undergoes are due to melodic template completion. For example,
it changes the tones of wɛla- ‘small opening’ to H in wél-íkwᵃ. And after the157noun fátára- with its HHL melody, the suffix surfaces as /-ikó-/. These and
several other tone combinations are shown in the following table:
(46)Plurative I {-iko-} according to tone melody

desyllabification in the nominative case (see §2.4.3 and §6.3.2). For
example, this means that in the nominative case the word for ‘bulls’ surfaces
as cúrúkaikwᵃ and the word for ‘small openings’ as wélíkwᵃ.","[188, 189]"
"175Take the compound in (69), for instance, where the noun dakú- ‘tree’ is used
as the modifying N1. Then compare the word order of the compound with
that of a normal noun phrase having the same meaning:
(69)Compound versus noun phrase
dakúMOD-ɓɔ́lHEADɓɔ́láHEADdakwíMODtree-shin:NOMshin:NOM tree:GEN‘tree trunk’‘trunk of the tree’As a third structural feature, compounds involve a special case marking: The
N1 takes the oblique case while the N2 takes whatever case the syntax
requires for the whole construction. In the oblique case, the form of the N1
is usually an exact representation of its underlying lexical form. An
exception to this statement is that a noun ending in a VV sequence will lose
its final vowel when joined to another noun in a compound. In the following
examples, the noun bubuu- ‘belly’ is compounded with aƙɔ́- ‘interior’.
Observe that the final vowel of bubuu- is lost and that only the case of the
N2, aƙɔ́-, changes with different clausal argument structures:
(70)Doda bubuaƙw.
dód-abubu-aƙw-ᵃhurt-REALbelly[OBL]-interior-NOM(My) inner belly hurts.
(71)Iya bubuaƙok.
i-ábubu-aƙɔ-kᵋbe-REALbelly[OBL]-interior-DAT‘It’s inside the belly.’
As a fourth structural feature, almost all Ik compounds are endocentric: The
N2 is always in the same grammatical category as the compound as a whole.
This is true of its word class (nominal) as well as its syntactic function. That
is, the morpho-syntactic function of the N2 in a compound is always the176same as that of the whole compound. The N1 , however, can be a pronoun,
noun, or a even a verb (in a special form), for example:
(72)Word class of compound N1
Pronounɲ́ci-ƙʊlɛ́‘my elbow’Nountsɔ́rá-ƙʊlɛ‘baboon’s elbow’Verbtakani-ƙʊlɛ́‘Appearing-Elbow (place name)’Two exceptional exocentric compounds are ámá-ze ‘big person (i.e. one in
charge)’ and roɓa-zeík ‘big people (ones in charge)’. The N2 of these
compounds is the verb ze- ‘be big’; the -ik in zeík is the adjectival plural
suffix (§7.10.5). These lexical compound are so rare it is believed they are
calques of the Teso-Turkana ‘positioner’ nouns ɛ́kápó lóni ̥ ‘big person’ and
ŋɪ́kápó lok ‘big people’ (e.g. in Dimmendaal 1983:274-276). The Ik calque of
ɛ́ká-pól-óni̥ ‘big person’ has another instantiation as ámá-ze-ám, a tri-nominal
compound with the structure PERSON- BIG- PERSON. This seems to be an even
more direct, structurally identical, calque of the Teso-Turkana equivalent.
As a fifth structural feature, each term in an Ik compound can be pluralized.
Semantics, though, may restrict which nouns this may apply to. For
example, there are no recorded examples of a plural N1 modifying a singular
N2. Otherwise, the first, second, or both compounded nouns are pluralized
with the same pluratives they have in non-compounded environments:

Compounds also have special semantic properties. The combined meaning
of the two compounded elements is either 1) more specific or 2) completely
different than the meanings of the individual constituents. For example, the
compound icé-ám ‘Ik person’ narrows the reference of the compound head
ám ‘person’. And the fact that the compound faɗi-ɡur ‘bitter-heart’ refers to
a type of pungent grass species is not automatically known from the
meanings of the two component parts.
These semantic properties predispose Ik compounds to futher semantic
developments. For example, their ability to narrow the reference of the
compound head has lead to the (partial?) grammaticalization of imá- ‘child’
and wicé- ‘children’ into diminutive markers (§4.3.3), as well as the
grammaticalization of ámá- ‘person’ and icé- ‘Ik/people’ into agentive
markers (§4.3.4). And with a subset of compound heads, compounding has
also lead to several locative expressions used as general place names, to the
gender specification of birds and animals, and to whole-part relationships
including body parts and their semantic extension as relational nouns.
A limited subset of compound heads with locative meanings is used for
general place names. These nouns, like aƙɔ́- ‘interior’, awá- ‘home/place’,
and hoo- ‘hut’, function like postpositions or even incipient case markers
(indeed some Ik case markers may have arisen from compound heads or
postpositions; see §6.4). Examples include the following:
(74)Compound common place names
aŋarasá-áƙwᵃ‘gravelly area’(lit. ‘gravel-interior’)awá-áƙwᵃ‘compound/yard’(lit. ‘home-interior’)dzíɡw-awᵃ‘market’(lit. ‘commerce-home’)ɡirésí-awᵃ‘storage place’(lit. ‘storing-home’)wáána-ho‘church’(lit. ‘prayer-hut’)178Another subset of compound heads act to specify the gender of birds and
animals. These include words like cikó- ‘male’, ŋwaá- ‘female’, and others:
(75)Compound gender specifications
ɗiɗe-cúrúkᵃ‘male donkey’(lit. ‘donkey-bull’)ɗiɗe-ŋwa‘female donkey’(lit. ‘donkey-female’)ɗiɗe-waz‘young female donkey’(lit. ‘donkey-young fem.’)ŋókí-cikwᵃ‘male dog’(lit. ‘dog-male’)ŋókí-ŋwa‘female dog’(lit. ‘dog-female’)Single body part terms can be combined with other body part terms or other
nouns to create compounds with more specific anatomical references:
(76)Compound anatomical specifications
aká-kwáɛ̆ᵃ‘lip’(lit. ‘mouth-tooth’)dɛá-mórókᵃ‘ankle’(lit. ‘leg-throat’)ekú-sítsʼᵃ‘eyelash, eyebrow’(lit. ‘eye-hair’)ɡubesí-ɔ́kᵃ‘thighbone’(lit. ‘thigh-bone’)sea-mucé‘blood vessel’(lit. ‘blood-path’)Some body part terms are also used extensively in compounds as whole-part
locative expressions often called ‘relational nouns’ (e.g. in König 2002:7375). These relational nouns are dealt with further below in §4.3.8.
The ability of compounds to express meanings greater or different than that
of the sum of their parts has made possible 1) creative coinages for newlyencountered technologies, 2) the lexicalization of names for things like
plants and animals, and 3) colorful idiomaticization.
As a productive word-building strategy, compounding is often use to coin
new terms for new technology. For example, a tripod is called leweɲí-dɛ
‘ostrich-foot’ due to its three-pronged structure. A small vehicle is
colloquially called kae-im or ‘little tortoise’. And several modern tools like179pliers and prongs are given the colorful title tilokotsi-akᵃ ‘hornbill-beak’. In a
reverseprocess,sometimesnewlyborrowedwordsreplaceoldercompounds, for example ɲámákɛtᵃ ‘market’ in place of dzíɡw-awᵃ.
A fair number of plant and place names are made up of compounds. Though
these compounds have been lexicalized, presumably in the past they were
coinages with meanings referencing the meanings of each of the two
compounded elements. Some examples include:

The nouns imá- ‘child’ and wicé- ‘children’ may convey the notion of
diminutiveness when acting as the head (N2) of a compound. But the degree
to which these nouns have been grammaticalized as diminutive suffixes is
difficult to ascertain. They can have both a grammaticalized diminutive
sense, as in ŋókí-im ‘puppy (dog-child)’ or a normal lexical sense, as in ɛdɛ́im ‘my brother’s child’—not ‘my little brother’. Examples of the semigrammaticalized usage of these suffixes include the following:

and the lexical meaning of young offspring:

been lexicalized as names for types of people or spirits, for example:181(82)Diminutive animate beings
dúné-im‘old woman’(lit. ‘age-child’)ídeme-im‘earth-worm’(lit. ‘snake-child’)kíʝá-im‘forest fairy’(lit. ‘earth-child’)ɲeɗeké-ím‘evil spirit’(lit. ‘sickness-child’)4.3.4 Agentive
Like the diminutive, the agentive compound involves a pair of lexical nouns
that seem to be on the way to being grammaticalized as agentive suffixes.
These are ámá- ‘person’ for singular and icé- ‘Ik’ for plural. As an analogy
with the diminutive, one might expect the plural agentive to be the lexical
plural of ‘person’, which is roɓa- ‘people’, but it is not. That icé- is also the
Ik’s name for themselves suggests that it may have once had a more general
meaning like ‘people’. Heine has made the plausible suggestion that the
agentive icé- is derived from the diminutive wicé- (Heine & König 1996:20).
While in Dime and Sheko, both Omotic languages not so far from Ik, the
agentive is derived from a form of the word for ‘father’ (Mulugeta 2008:59).
‘Agentive’ is used here in a broad sense, not just for the semantic role of
‘agent’ but for anyone characterized by the reference of the N1. The
equivalent of the Ik agentive in Turkana is called a ‘positioner noun’ and is
divided up into such categories as ‘agentive’, ‘processor’, and ‘essive’
(Dimmendaal 1983:274), but this is not done here. In its most basic
conception, the Ik agentive means ‘the X person’ or ‘the X-people’. It can
also be translated as ‘the person/people who X’ or ‘X-er(s)’, depending on
the compound’s N1, which can be a noun or a nominalized verb. So the
agentive, broadly defined, covers a range of nuances like 1) a person doing
an action, 2) a person characterized by a state, 3) a person characterized by
a thing, and 4) a person belonging to a group, particularly an ethnic group.
The N1 of an agentive compound can be a noun or nominalized verb. The
following are examples of agentives with nouns as the N1:182(83)Agentives with a nominal N1
SingularPluralcooka-ama-cooka-icé‘shepherd(s)’dɛá-áma-dɛá-ícé-‘messenger(s)’dzú-áma-dzú-íce-‘thief(ves)’ɛ́sá-ama-ɛ́sá-ice-‘drunkard(s)’ƙaƙa-ama-ƙaƙa-icé-‘hunter(s)’tɔkɔba-ama-tɔkɔba-icé-‘farmer(s)’But in the majority of agentive compounds, the N1 is a nominalized verb,
either transitive or intransitive. In principle, there is no restriction on the
number of affixes found on such N1 verbs. For many deverbal agentives, the
best English translation usually involves the suffix -er(s):

translation into English often involves adjective modifiers e.g.:

Compounds are also made with pronouns serving as N1, N2, or both. These
pronominal compounds include the personal possessive (§5.1.2), the
emphatic (§5.1.3), and the impersonal possessum (§5.2):
(86)Pronominal compounds
Personal possessiveɲ́ci-raɡo-I[OBL]-ox‘my ox’Emphaticɲ́ci-nebu-I[OBL]-body‘myself’Impersonal possessumɲj-ɛ́nɪ ́-I-PSSM‘mine’4.3.6 Internal plurative
The internal plurative -aʝɪ́ká- is a complex compound N2 composed of the
unknown root aʝ- and the plurative III {-ɪka-}. Because of its function as a
plurative, a tempting analysis is to treat it as a suffix. However, because a) it
does not delete the stem-final vowel, and b) it does not change the stem
tone melody, it must be viewed as the N2 of a compound construction.
The internal plurative expresses the meaning ‘the interior of more than one
X’. The root aʝ- has not been identified as an independent noun. But both
form and meaning suggest a connection with the noun aƙɔ́- ‘inside/interior’,
which when pluralized (aƙwɪ́nɪ́-) and used in compounds, has a similar184meaning as the internal plurative. The internal plurative is not often used,
but three examples of it are given below:
(87)Internal plurative compounds
PluralInternal Pl.áw-íkᵃ‘homes’→áw-íka-aʝɪ ́ká-‘in/among homes’ríʝ-íkᵃ‘forests’→ríʝ-íka-aʝɪ ́ká-‘in/among forests’séd-ikᵃ‘gardens’→séd-ika-aʝɪ ́ká-‘in/among gardens’4.3.7 Variative plurative
The variative plurative -icíká- is also a complex N2 possibly composed of the
sequence -ic- and the plurative III {-ɪka-}. Like the internal plurative, it may
be tempting to view this N2 as a suffix instead, but it does not a) subtract
the stem-final vowel nor b) altern the stem tone melody. So for those
reasons, it is analyzed here as (semi-) grammaticalized N2.
The variative plurative expresses the meaning ‘kinds of X’ or ‘various X’.
Structurally, it seems to be either a) a reduplication of the plurative III
{-ɪka-} or b) a combination of the diminutive/agentive (w)icé- and the
plurative III {-ɪka-}. Regardless of it etymology, -icíká- is often used to
pluralize nouns not normally (re-)pluralizeable, for example 1) general
number nouns, 2) nouns not pluralizeable with any other plurative, 3)
inherently plural nouns, 4) nominalized verbs, 5) and pluralized nouns.

pluralized with another plurative. (92) gives the only recorded example:

A number of Ik body-part terms are used in whole-part expressions as
‘relational’ nouns (König 2002:73-75). These nouns are found in two
morpho-syntactic positions: 1) as the N 2 of a compound (hence their being
treated in this section on compounds) and 2) as a noun phrase head with a)
the possessive singulative and b) a genitive modifier (which may be
implied). Though synchronically they still function as full nouns (that can
take any of the eight morphological cases), the relational nouns exhibit a
very ‘preposition-like’ function, particularly as the noun phrase head. The
following two tables compare singular and plural relational nouns:

lexical meaning has been recovered. It has been lexicalized in the term didiɡwarí ‘weather-top’, an important cultural concept meaning ‘sky, heaven’ or
‘God’. And the only known possible lexical meaning for the commonly used
relational noun aƙɔ́- ‘inside’ comes from Gumuz word -(á)kʼw(á) ‘head’.
In principle, the terms listed in (94) are productive, but in practice, many of
them have set up into lexicalized expressions like the following. Herein lies
the main source—apart from borrowing—of Ik lexical nominal enrichment:

For
example, Ik kinship relations are patrilocal: New wives are brought in from
outside a man’s clan to his parents’ home area. They are also patrilineal: All
one’s relatives are understood in relation to one’s father and paternal uncles.
For instance, the term abáŋi- meaning ‘my father’ applies not only to one’s
birth father but also to any of the his brothers. So one may essentially have
more than one ‘father’. But the brother of one’s birth mother is referred to
as momóo- or ‘uncle’ rather than ‘father’.
A second feature of the Ik kinship terminology is that it is based on
reference to person (i.e. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person). The term needed to refer to
a particular relative depends on whether it is the relative of the speaker, the
addressee, or a third-person non-speech-act participant. For example, if the
speaker names her father, she will call him abáŋ ‘my father’, but if she
names her addressee’s father, she will say bábo ‘your father’. And if she
refers to someone else’s father, she will say babatᵃ ‘his/her father’.
Morphologically, Ik kinship terms exhibit a couple of notable features. First,
many of them are made up of compounds. They may join two nouns, as in
momó-cekᵃ ‘maternal aunt (lit. ‘uncle-wife’)’ or totó-im ‘maternal cousin (lit.
‘maternal aunt’s child’)’. Others may join a pronoun and a noun, as in ŋɡóím ‘younger sibling (lit. ‘our child’)’ or bi-emetá ‘your in-law’. Secondly, in
the Ik person-based kinship reference system, one can find traces of archaic
person-marking morphology that has been completely lost in the rest of the
grammar. Compare the following forms:
(96)Archaic possessive suffixes on kinship terms
Person‘father’‘mother’‘grandmother’1SGabáŋi-yáŋi-dadáŋi-2SGbáboo-ŋóo-dádoo-3SGbabatí-ŋwaatí-dadatí-189That the forms in (96) retain old possessive suffixes is most clearly seen in
the words for ‘father’ and ‘grandmother’. These suffixes are *-áŋi- for first
person, *-(o)o- for second, and *-atí- for third person (which may come from
an old singulative; see (28) above)—all singular. With this in mind, these
kinship terms can be re-analyzed as follows in order to highlight their
historical morphology (which has now been lexicalized):
(97)Archaic possessive suffixes in analysis
Person‘father’‘mother’‘grandmother’1SG(*b)ab-áŋi-y-áŋi-dad-áŋi-2SGbáb-oo-ŋó-o-dád-oo-3SGbab-atí-ŋw-aatí-dad-atí-The old root *bab, meaning ‘father’, presumably lost its initial /b/ in the
first-person reference at some point in time. In the case of ‘mother’, it seems
that based on the second and third-person reference, the old root is *ŋo. For
second person, the possessive suffix -(o)o- is shortened, possibly due to Ik’s
dislike for sequences of three vowels. And for third person, the root
desyllabifies and causes compensatory lengthening on the suffix. When it
comes to the first person, it is not clear how *ŋo could be related to *y.
The old possessive prefixes shown in (96) are found elsewhere in the kinship
terminology but in an even more eroded form. Often the second and thirdperson suffixes are the only ones remaining:
(98)Archaic possessive suffixes on other kinship terms
Person‘brother’‘sister’‘grandfather’1SG(ɛdɛ́ɛ-)ye-áa-bob-áa-2SGlé-ó-yá-óo-bób-oo3SGle-atíye-atíbob-atí-190Before the loss of lateral fricatives in Ik, the root for ‘brother’ used to be *ɬɪ(Heine & König 1996:17). And if there ever was a proto-form *le-áŋi- for ‘my
brother’, it has been replaced by the unrelated ɛdɛ́ɛ-. Elsewhere in (98), the
first-person suffix -áŋi- has lost its velar nasal, giving rise to the variant -áa.
The following table presents a set of kinship terms including the ones shown
in (96) and (98). These terms are from the point of view of Ego or ‘I’—that
is, the first person. Second and third-person forms can be extrapolated from
these. Moreover, they are all listed in the lexicon in Appendix B. To change
person, either the archaic (frozen) possessive suffixes can be changed (as
when going from bobá ‘my grandfather’ to bóbo ‘your grandfather’) or the N1
pronouns in compounds (as in ɲ́ ci-cekᵃ ‘my wife’ to ntsí-cékᵃ ‘his wife’). The
literal meaning of compounded terms is also given when known:

"533The concept of ‘why?’ is typically expressed with the word isi- ‘what?’ plus
a) the dative case marking the semantic role of ‘purpose’ or b) the ablative
case marking the ‘cause/reason’ semantic role. In this function, isi- acts as a
peripheral argument within the clause. Even in this role it can fall in the
canonical post-VS or post-VAO position or be fronted:
(186)Ƙeesida isik?
ƙe-es-íd-aisi-kᵉgo-INT-2SG-REAL what-DAT
Why are you going (lit. ‘You are going for what (purpose)’)?
(187)Ƙeesida isu?

(188)Isio ƙeesidad?
isi-oƙe-es-íd-a=dᵉwhy-COPgo-INT-2SG-REAL=DPWhy are you going (lit. ‘It is what you are going for/from’)?
Another way of expressing ‘what?’ is with the compound noun isi-ɛnɪ́-kᵋ. This
compound combines isi- ‘what?’ with the possessum suffix -ɛnɪ́- into a
compound marked with the dative case. This form of ‘why?’ is often used in
isolation without other words, as in the stand-alone isi-ɛnɪ́-kᵋ ‘Why?’.","[564, 565]"
"283Going a step further, when a transitive verb is made into a causative, the
subject (A) of the original verb is treated as an object (O) of the nowcausative verb. But, the object (O) of the original verb is now treated as a
second object or extension (E) in the now causative construction. The data
below shows what happens when the transitive verb wet- ‘drink’, which
requires an agent (A) and a patient (O), is causativized:
(157)Wetuo ima cemerik.
wet-u-oim-aAcɛmɛrɪ-kᵃOdrink-3SG-SEQchild-NOMherb-ACCAnd the child drank the medicine.
(158)Wetituƙotuo imaa cemerik.
wet-it-úƙót-u-oimá-áOcɛmɛrɪ-kᵋEdrink-CAUS- COMP-3SG-SEQchild-ACCherb-DATAnd she made the child take the medicine.
In (157)-(158), the subject (A) of the first clause (im ‘child’) becomes the
patient (O) in the second, now causative clause. And the patient (O) of the
first clause (cɛmɛr ‘herb’) becomes a second or extended object (E) in the
second clause. So in a sense, through a metaphorical extension of the
Location role, the extended object becomes the ‘site’ of the causation.
As a side topic, it is worth mentioning that the Ik verb iryám-ét-oni- ‘to get’
(cf. Teso-Turkana a-ryam-un) always takes an argument in the dative case:
(159)Iryameida bee ŋitsanie?
iryam-é-íd-a=beeŋɪ ́tsanɪ ́-ɛget-VEN-2SG- REAL=PST2 troubles-DAT
Did you get trouble yesterday?
At first glance, it would appear that this is an instance where a core
argument is marked with the dative, a non-core-marking case. However, it284is more likely that despite the English translation of this verb as ‘get’, it is
really an intransitive verb, making the object in fact a peripheral argument.
A clue for this comes from Teso-Turkana, where a-ryam-un ‘to get’ is related
to aki-ryam-un ‘to meet with’. As such, this Ik verb may carry more the idea
of ‘meeting with sth.’ (e.g. ‘acquiring’) as opposed to merely ‘getting’ it.
Finally, on the basis of example (160) below, König has claimed that the
verb form bɪra-e shows a ‘petrified’ form of the dative case on the verb bɪrá‘not there’. She analyzes this verb form as bɪra-DAT and suggests that it has
been lexicalized into a ‘preposition’ meaning ‘without’ (2002:255):
(160)…ɠo-í-akakum-eɛdábɪ ́ra-eíŋar-esí-kᵃgo-1SG-aKakuma-DATalonebe.NEG-DAT help-INF-ACCI went alone to Kakuma without any help.
But this analysis is flawed due to incorrect morphological parsing. The verb
form in question is not bɪra-e analyzed as bɪra-DAT but rather bɪrá-ɪ́-ɛ
analyzed as bɪrá-3SG-SIML. This form is not a noun or verb fossilized into a
preposition but rather an instance of the impersonal, 3SG adverbial
simultaneous verbs used in clause chains (§11.2.2). It is true that this verb
form is often best translated as ‘without’ into English, but it does not follow
that it has become a ‘preposition’. The example sentence in (160), taken
from König (2002:255) is reanalyzed and glossed here as follows:
(161)Ƙoyaa Kakumee eɗa, birayee iŋaaresik.

"2.5.2 De-affrication
In the introduction of this grammar, the Ik word for themselves (Ikᵃ) and the
Ik word for ‘head’ (ikᵃ) were said to be homophonous in the nominative
case. In accordance with their homophony, it has been suggested that the Ik
people were the ‘head’ of ancient migrations. But their being the same word
historically is challenged by the fact that in the other cases, their base forms
are different: icé- ‘Ik’ and iká- ‘head’. Comparing the full case declensions of
these two noun roots opens up the discussion of (de-)affrication:70(68)Non-final case paradigm for icé- ‘Ik’ and iká- ‘head’
‘Ik’‘head’icé-iká-OBLiceikaNOMik-aik-aINSik-o (ic-o?)ik-oABLicé-ó/icó-óikó-óGENicé-éiké-éACCicé-áiká-áDATicé-éiké-éCOPicé-ó/icó-óikó-óBase formAs discussed further in §6.3, the Ik nominative and instrumental case
suffixes first subtract the final vowel of the root to which they attach. This
means that for icé- ‘Ik’, once the /é/ is deleted, the /c/ is directly exposed to
the nominative suffix {-a} or the instrumental suffix {-ɔ}. So, unlike in other
regional languages where affrication of /k/ to /c/ before high vowels is
common (e.g. Luganda), (68) presents a situation in Ik where /c/ deaffricates to /k/ before non-front vowels /a/ and /o/. De-affrication is also
attested in other roots similar to icé-, like wicé- ‘children’ and ɲ́ci- ‘I’.
This type of de-affrication applies only at the morpheme boundary between
noun root and two case suffixes. If it applied more generally, one would
expect words like caalɪ́- ‘hearth-stone’ to become *kaalɪ ́-, which it does not.
Ik de-affrication can be captured in the following aphorism:
(69)Morphophonological Rule 2 (M2)—De-affrication
•In noun roots ending in the sequence /cV-/, the /c/ ‘hardens’ to
[k] when the final vowel is substracted by the nominative or
instrumental case suffixes.","[101, 102]"
"499Likewise, in the relative clause itself, the CA can also have any core or
peripheral function. Since the CA is only stated in the MC and not in the RC,
it is not relevant to comment on the nominal case in which the CA in an RC
may occur. If it is the subject of the RC, the CA is cross-refenced on the verb
with subject-agreement pronominals. If it is the object, then it is inferred
from the grammatical context. If it is a peripheral argument, it is crossreferenced on the verb with the dummy pronominal {=ˊdɛ}. But regardless
of what type of argument the CA is in the RC, it is represented by one of the
relative pronouns which are the topic of the next section, §9.8.2.
The following three examples show the CA in relative clauses functioning as
subject, object, and peripheral argument, respectively. The CA in (92), ámá‘person’, acts as the subject of the verb iwák- ‘holler’ in the MC, while in the
RC, it is the agent of the causativized verb tsídz-it-ét- ‘flush out’:

The person who flushes out an animal hollers an alarm.
By contrast, the CA in (93) is a core argument marked with the dative case
in the main clause (dakú-é) but the object of the transitive verb kam-ʊƙɔt‘take hold of’ in the relative clause. The non-CA agent of the RC,
buɗámóniicéá, takes the accusative case as would any core argument:

[Beware of] this stick that Africans have taken hold of (i.e. guns).
Lastly, the noun phrase in (94), introduced by the preposition kóteré
‘because of’, marks the CA kaɪnɪ́- ‘year’ as peripheral argument in the
oblique case. In the relative clause, this CA is would also be a peripheral500argument but one marked with the instrumental case (since it is a time
concept). Because of that, its absence in the relative clause is marked with
the dummy pronoun on the transitive verb kʊp-ʊƙɔt- ‘burn up’:
(94)Kotere kaini noo fetia kupuƙotee eɗik.

"7A noun after a prepositionThe first function of the oblique case―marking the subject (A/S) of an
imperative or optative clause―is illustrated in the two following examples:
(36)Ƙae bi awak.

And then (lit. ‘let go’) we just killed the warthog.
The second function―marking the object (O) of an imperative or optative
clause―is illustrated in (38) for imperative and (39) for optative:
(38)Dee ɗi nak.
d-e-eɗɪO=nákᵃbring-VEN-IMP.SGone[OBL]=DEM.SG.PST 1Bring the one of earlierǃ
(39)Nesibano nai na.
nesíb-anonaíO=nahear-OPThere[OBL]=DEM.SGLet’s listen here (i.e. ‘Let’s listen to this.’)
The third function of the oblique case―marking the complement of an
identity copula clause―is shown in the next two examples. In an Ik copula
clause of identity, the copula mɪt- ‘be (sth. or sb.)’ links the copula subject
(CS) with the copula complement (CC). As seen below, the copula subject
occurs in the nominative case, while the complement occurs in the oblique:
(40)Mitiya noo terega ntsie ɗusesi tsʼiƙae.

wet.season[OBL]The land was wet season (i.e. it was wet season).tsʼɪƙá-ᵋ

nominal compound. The first nominal element must be in the oblique case,
while the second element takes whatever case the syntactic context calls for.
In this grammar, compounds are identified with a hyphen between the two
nouns or pronouns in question. (42) gives two examples of compounds in
isolation, and (43)-(44) give two in complete sentences:
(42)ɗerocemerepuaw

And the elders were sitting at the foot of the tree.
The fifth function of the oblique case is to mark the complement of a
quotative clause if the complement is a single noun, usually isi- ‘what’:
(45)Kutia naa bie is?
kʊt-ɪ ́-a=naabi-e[is]QUOT COMPLEMENTsay-1SG-REAL=PST1 you.SG-DAT what[OBL]
I said to you what?
The sixth function of the oblique case is to mark the ‘vocative’, that is, any
noun referring to a person being called. Take the following examples:250(46)Ee wiceǃIyida, abaŋi?","[279, 280, 281, 282]"
"272It does not delete the final vowel of the stem but instead attaches directly to
it. Before a pause, the vowel of the suffix devoices, changing the suffix to
/-kᵃ/ or /-k̚/. And within a phrase, the suffix loses the /k/, changing the
suffix simply to /-a/. If the stem-final vowel is a high back vowel, it may
desyllabify and cause the accusative suffix to lengthen in compensation:

core clausal arguments, namely the following:
(124)Accusative case grammatical functions
1Direct object (O) of a transitive clause with a 3SG/PL subject2Direct object (O) of all subordinate clauses3Subject (A/S) of any subordinate clause (except sequential)First, the accusative marks the direct objects (O) of transitive clauses with
third person subjects. If the subject of the clause is first or second person,
then both the subject and the object(s) take the nominative case (§6.3.1).
See, for example, the pattern in the following paradigm, in which the
accusative case (underlined) is found only with the third person verb forms:273(125)Number-based differential accusative marking
1SGbɛ́ɗɪ ́a ŋƙáƙ-ᵃ‘I want food.’2SGbɛ́ɗɪ ́da ŋƙáƙ-ᵃ‘You want food.’3SGbɛ́ɗá ŋƙáƙá-kᵃ‘S/he wants food.’1PL.EXCbɛ́ɗɪ ́ma ŋƙáƙ-ᵃ‘We want food.’1PL.INCbɛ́ɗɪ ́sɪna ŋƙáƙ-ᵃ‘We want food.’2PLbɛ́ɗɪ ́ta ŋƙáƙ-ᵃ‘You want food.’3PLbɛ́ɗáta ŋƙáƙá-kᵃ‘They want food.’Taken from narratives, the following two sentences show the accusative
marking the object (O) of transitive clauses with 3SG/PL person subjects:
(126)Tsidziteta naa inok.
tsídz-it-et-a=nááínó-kᵃOcarry-CAUS-VEN-REAL=PST1 animal-ACC
He flushed out an animal (from a thicket).
(127)Ɗamatini awaa bubun.
ɗamat-iniawá-áObʊbʊn-ᵓshoot-SEQhome-ACCcoal-INSAnd they opened fire on the home (with ‘coals’=bullets).
As noted in the Case Overview (§6.1), Ik is classified as a split-accusative
language due to this type of number-based differential object marking.
While this is the descriptive fact, can any explanation be offered for it?
Some attempts can be made, though none are conclusive. König suggests
that accusative marking comes into play when cross-referencing ‘fails’ on
the verb (2008:85). That is, if the subject is not cross-referenced on the
verb, case is needed to show grammatical relations. But this explanation
falls short on two accounts: 1) First, clausal constituent order is not flexible
enough to admit the kind of ambiguity implied by König’s analysis. 2) The
‘failure’ of cross-reference (i.e. a zero morpheme) is in itself cross-reference.","[303, 304, 305]"
"242Another variation—total vowel assimilation—occurs when a [-ATR] noun
ending in /a/, like ŋʊrá- ‘cane rat’, is inflected for all eight cases:

dative, and copulative cases totally assimilate the root-final /a/ of ŋʊrá-.
Total assimilation of this type is widespread in the language (§2.9.4) and is
an important key to unlocking the case system as a whole.
Finally, the [+ATR] noun dakú- ‘tree’, when inflected for all the cases,
brings out a few more morphophonological variations, as discussed below:
(29)Case inflection of dakú- ‘tree’
CaseNon-final (/____...#)Final (/_____#)NOMdakw-adakw-ᵃINSdak-odak-ᵒABLdakú-ó (dakw-óó)dakú-∅GENdakú-é (dakw-éé)dakú-ⁱ (dakwí-∅)DATdakú-é (dakw-éé)dakú-kᵉACCdakú-á (dakw-áá)dakú-kᵃCOPdakú-ó (dakw-óó)dakú-kᵒOBLdakudakᵘ243One thing to note from (29) is that in the nominative case, the root dakú‘tree’ does not surface *dak-a/dak-ᵃ ‘tree-NOM’. This goes against what is
normally expected from stem reduction. In fact, a small number of nouns
ending in a back vowel retain them as the semi-vowel /w/. To see a list of
other such exceptions to the rule, skip ahead to §6.3.1 on the nominative.
A second thing to note is that in the five cases that involve the full
underlying noun root and a suffix consisting of a vowel only, a root-final
back vowel may be optionally desyllabified to /w/ (§2.4.2). When this
happens, the back vowel gives up its mora to the following case suffix,
which results in the compensatory lengthening of that suffix.
Lastly, in the final form of the genitive case, when the genitive case suffix
{-ɛ,e} follows a high back vowel, the high back vowel may raise it to /ɪ, i/.","[273, 274, 275]"
"1934.5.1 Onomastics
Most Ik people nowadays have three or four names each. They will have an
Ik name, a Christian (‘baptismal’) name, and a nickname called éda awáᵉ
‘house name’. In addition, most men have a ráɡw-edᵃ ‘bull name’ that goes
along with their bull songs. Beyond this, many people seem to have several
secret names that only their friends or in-members of the community know.
When filling out official forms or introducing themselves to outsiders, Ik
people typically give two names: 1) an Ik name, and 2) a Christian name.
The Ik names are the main topic of this section. Christian names are taken
at birth or at baptism in the Roman Catholic or Anglican churches. They
include names like Philip, Daniel, Peter, Simon, and Hillary for boys and
men, and Cecilia, Maria, Esther, Rose, and Veronica for girls and women.
Bull names are totems chosen by young men for a bull whose color patterns
they admire. This cultural practice is in line with that of the Teso-Turkana
and may have been borrowed from them. Though the Ik no longer keep
livestock, men still take bull names and sing their bull songs. Bull names
usually consist of the Teso-Turkana word apá ‘father’ plus one or more
words describing the color and patterns of a particular bull. Most bull
names, even for the Ik, are actually Teso-Turkana names, like Apá Lɔpʊsɪƙɪra
‘the father of the striped bull’ and Apá Lokiryon ‘the father of the black bull’.
A few other bull-names heard among the Ik are listed here below. For more
on this topic, see Dimmendaal (1983:300-302).

evident from the Teso-Turkana gender prefixes na- for feminine gender and
lo- for masculine (see Dimmendaal 1983:215), which are not productive
morphemes in present-day Ik (see also §4.1.4). These names are formed
with the prefix plus some feature in the environment that indicates what
time of year or during what event the person bearing the name was born.
For example, Lokiru (lo+akiru ‘rain’) was born during the rainy season.
(105) provides a sampling of Ik people names with Teso-Turkana origins:

And still
others are Teso-Turkana parallels but have distinctively Ik phonology. For
example, the phoneme /tʃ/ in Teso-Turkana names (written as <ch>)
usually (but not obligatorily) appears as /ts/ in corresponding Ik names:

The Ik language does not have a word that means ‘tribe’ specifically, except
now for ɲákaɓɪláa- which was borrowed from Swahili kabila ‘tribe’. Other
words for this domain include asaka- ‘clan’ (also ‘door’) and roɓa-icíká‘kinds of people’ or ‘various peoples’. This lack of a generic word for ‘tribe’
is made up for by a versatile system of tribal names (ethnonyms).
Ik uses three morphological strategies for forming ethnonyms: 1) the Ik way,
2) the Teso-Turkana way, and 3) a hybrid Ik/Teso-Turkana way. The
genuinely Ik way of making ethnonyms is to take a word characteristic of a
certain ethnic group and make an agentive compound out of it.
So for instance, the Jie, a Karimojong sub-tribe to the southeast of the Ik,
are called the Fetí-íkᵃ because they are from the East, where the sun comes
up (fetí- means ‘sun’ and fetí-éku- ‘sun-eye’ means ‘east’). The Turkana, the
tribe to the northeast of the Ik are called the Pakó-íkᵃ after pakó- ‘cave’
probably because the word eturkan means ‘cave’ in the Turkana language.
Lastly, the Napore, who live in the mountains west of the Ik, are called the
Tɔbɔŋɔ́-íkᵃ after tɔbɔŋɔ́ - ‘maize mush’ because of all the food they have:196(108)Ik agentive compound ethnonyms

Teso-Turkana. These ethnonyms retain the plural grammatical gender prefix
ŋi- that is a productive morphological marker in Teso-Turkana (but is no
longer in Ik, if it ever was; see §4.1.4), as in the following:
(109)Ik ethnonyms with a Teso-Turkana plural gender prefix
Ŋíɗiŋaá-‘Didinga’Ŋímaɗíi-‘Ma’di’Ŋítépesí-‘Tepeth’Ŋɪ ́ɓɔ́kɔraá-‘Bokora’The third way Ik has formed ethnonyms is to combine the Ik use of agentive
compound with the Teso-Turkana plural forms, as in:
(110)Ik agentive ethnonyms with a Teso-Turkana plural gender prefix
Ŋíjaluwói-icé-‘Luo people’Ŋíkátsolí-ícé-‘Acholi people’Ŋímeniŋí-ícé-‘Mening people’Ŋimólói-icé-‘Elmolo people’1974.5.3 Toponyms
Ik place names (toponyms) can be divided up between those that have TesoTurkana origins and those that have an Ik origin. Those borrowed from
Teso-Turkana are known by their lexicalized locative prefixes (see §4.1.4).
Many original Ik place names are formed by compounds (see §4.3), while
others consist of a single word or simple phrase. These place names may
refer to areas, rivers, mountains, or other geographical features.
Most toponyms borrowed into Ik from Teso-Turkana languages consist of
the lexicalized Teso-Turkana locative prefixes or associative marker plus a
noun or verb that characterizes the named place in some way. For example,
a volcanic plug in Kaabong District called Locom, ‘Baboon Place’, is made up
of the masculine/neuter locative prefix lo- plus the noun root -com meaning
‘baboon’. (111) presents a sampling of this type of Ik place name:

root -moru ‘mountain/rock’ used in a compound with another root, as in:
(112)Ik mountain names from Teso-Turkana
Moru-aŋákinéi-‘Goat Mountain’Morú-atapá-‘Bread Mountain’Morú-érisá-‘Leopard Mountain’Moru-koyanɪ ́-‘Tall Mountain’Morú-ɲaŋá-‘Revenge Mountain’198The Ik use Teso-Turkana place names for several possible reasons. First,
some places, like Kaabong or Kasile, are far enough outside the Ik homeland
not to warrant a name other than the Teso-Turkana name. Second, while
interacting with Teso-Turkana neighbours, perhaps the Ik found it easier to
use the more widely known toponyms. And third, though this would
contradict some versions of Ik history in the literature, the Ik may have
settled in their current homeland after the Teso-Turkana tribes had arrived
and given names to the landscape (see Schrock 2009).
A fair number of Ik place names are made of compounds. For some, the
compound N2 is a general locative noun like aká- ‘mouth’, aƙɔ́- ‘inside’, awá‘place/home’, or kíʝá- ‘land’, as in:
(113)Ik compound toponyms with general locative N2

specific locative reference, as in:

Not all the meanings are known:

Dumáná-mériʃi-‘Spotted Duman’Dúné-morókú-‘Dune Throat’Kae-hɪ ́ƙɔ́ɔ-‘Tortoise Chameleon’Ɲɛra-dzoɡa-‘Girls Tree (sp.)’Turkware-ekú-‘Turkwara Eye’Some place names have stories associated with them, for example, the name
Takani-ƙʊlɛ́ɛ- from the verb takán- ‘be visible’ and ƙʊlɛ́ɛ- ‘elbow’. The story
goes that at this place, an old woman tried to hide from enemies who were
attacking her neighbourhood. But at the place where she hid, her elbow was
visible, and the enemies spotted her because of that.
The Ik equivalent of the Teso-Turkana mountain names beginning with the
root -moru are formed with the Ik roots ɡwasá- ‘rock’, kokoró- ‘ridge’, kuɓa‘hill’ or kwará- ‘mountain’. Such names include the following:

The term ‘pronoun’ is used here rather loosely. This chapter describes words
and affixes that truly represent missing or implied nouns. But it also
includes certain nouns and affixes that have meanings like the pronouns in
other languages (e.g. English). In some cases, it is not easy to tell whether a
particular item is a grammatical word with a pronominal function or a full
lexical noun with a pronoun-like meaning. For example, saí- means ‘some
more’ or ‘some other’, although it inflects fully for case and can take a
nominal complement as in saa róɓaᵉ ‘some other people’. So is it a noun or a
pronoun? The goal of this chapter is to describe anything identified as either
a pronoun or noun with pronominal meanings or functions.
Ik pronominals comprise a) independent words, b) words found only in
compounds, c) clitics, and d) suffixes. All pronominals inflect for case,
except for relative pronouns, clitics and verbal suffixes. Some of the
pronominals are invariable in terms of grammatical number, while others
have suppletive plurals or can be pluralized with one of the language’s
pluratives. When it comes to personal pronouns, Ik is a pro-drop language,
requiring minimally only bound pronominal subject-agreement suffixes.","[224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"
"2626.3.4 Ablative
Like the instrumental, the ablative case suffix has the form {-ɔ}. It has a
likely parallel in the Lowland Cushitic language Saho where the suffix -ko is
the bound form of a ‘source marker’ (Banti & Vergari 2005:14). If these
forms are cognate, that would explain why the Ik ablative suffix does not
subtract the stem-final vowel: In an older form as *-kɔ, it would have
required that vowel to break up a disallowed CC cluster. Another potential
parallel is the locative suffix -ó in South Omotic Dime (Mulugeta 2008:55).
The ablative case suffix has a L tone but may take a H depending on the
tone melody of the stem (T7). It is recessive in terms of vowel harmony, but
harmonizes to /-o/ when attached to a [+ATR] stem. The crucial
morphological difference between the ablative and instrumental suffixes is
that, unlike the instrumental, the ablative does not subtract the nominal
stem-final vowel. Instead, the final vowel remains. Before a pause, the
ablative suffix is devoiced to /-ᵓ/ or /-ᵒ/. And if the ablative suffix attaches
to a stem ending in a high back vowel (/ɔ, o, ʊ, u/) before a pause, it may
not be heard audibly at the surface level of pronunciation (i.e. [-∅]:

assimilations (see §2.9.4). For example, if the final vowel of a nominal stem
in a phrase-medial position is /ɪ/ or /a/, these two vowels get totally
assimilated to the ablative suffix (see sɪsɪ́- ‘honey-beer’ and ŋʊrá- ‘cane rat’).
Also, if the final vowel of a nominal stem in a phrase-final position is /i/ or
/ɪ/, these vowels get partially assimilated to /u/ and /ʊ/ respectively.
In terms of grammatical function, the ablative case is used to mark non-core
clause arguments with ‘from’ or ‘at’ semantic roles including the following:

the Location of an action or state. The first two sentences below illustrate
this role with intransitive verbs, while the second two do it with transitives:
(92)Sarata epa hoikao.

It is forbidden to eat honey in the top of the tree.
Third, the ablative case is used to mark peripheral arguments with the
semantic role of Cause, which can be animate or inanimate. The next two
sentences illustrate the role of Cause with animate entities. Keep in mind
that this construction is susceptible to interpretation as encoding the
demoted agent of a passive. This view is perpetuated, for example, in Heine
& König (1996:33), but Ik speakers insist that strictly cause, not agency, is
in expresed by the ablative. Cause and agency are semantically related, of
course. But while an agent is also a cause, a cause need not also be an agent:265(96)Detosa waicika ni ncu.

The fourth semantic role encoded by the ablative is the Stimulus role. For
example, the verbs mor- ‘fear, respect’ and ʃɛɓ- ‘be shy, afraid’ take a
peripheral argument in the ablative case. This peripheral argument provides
the Stimulus for the sensation of fear or timidity, as in:

environments: 1) with the nominative case suffix {-a}, 2) with the
instrumental case suffix {-ɔ}, and 3) with any of the number suffixes. The
other six case markers preserve the stem-final vowel (see more in §6.2). This
recalls the situation in the South Omotic language Dime, where any suffix
beginning with a vowel first subtracts the noun-final vowel (Mulugeta
2008:38, 41). It is noteworthy that all but two Ik nominal suffixes that
delete noun-final vowels also begin with a vowel. The two exceptions, the
ablative {-ɔ} and the genitive {-ɛ}, may have lost their initial consonants.
As noted above, any post-lexical noun must have a case suffix. Six out of the
eight Ik cases allow the stem-final vowel to persist. Only the nominative and
the instrumental (as well as number suffixes) first subtract it. The practical
problem is that the citation or isolation form of a noun in Ik takes the
nominative case, thereby losing its final vowel. This means than unless a
noun is given in one of the six non-subtractive cases, a non-native speaker134cannot guess the final vowel. For this reason, whenever the final vowel of a
noun is relevant to a particular point or purpose (for example in Appendix
B—Ik root lexicon), an abstract form of the noun is written with a hyphen.","[164, 165, 166]"
"7.10.1 Physical property I
The adjectival suffix {-V́d-} is a called the ‘physical property I’ marker. It is
potentially related to the final VC sequence in Turkana words like jʊrʊt
‘callow’ (Dimmendaal 1983:143). But regardless, it is most likely a retention
of the proto-Nilo-Saharan ‘adjective suffix’ *-d/-od? (Ehret 2001:154). The
suffix usually (but not always) copies the root-final vowel, and thus takes
whatever [ATR] value the copied vowel has. Its tone is invariably H(L):
Since it contains the depressor /d/, the next vowel always bears L tone.
The physical property I suffix is used to express real physical properties of
the clause’s subject. These properties include things like size, shape,
appearance, texture, consistency, and other such tangible attributes. The
meaning of this suffix often coincides with that of English adjectives ending
in -y, like gooey, gummy, gushy, squashy, squishy, etc.
Physical property I (PHYS1) adjectivals function as the heads of intransitive
predicates, such that they are nominalized with the infinitivizer {-ɔnɪ-}, as
in ɔf-ɔ́d-ɔnɪ- ‘to be light’. The PHYS1 suffix immediately follows the root but
can precede any number of other verbal affixes, such as in ol-ód-uƙot-ukó=dᵉ ‘And from that it became light’ or ol-ód-aak-ít-ᵃ ‘You (pl.) are light’.
The table in (257) presents some physical property I lexical adjectivals. In
the first four examples, the suffix’s underspecified vowel a copy of the
preceding root-vowel. While in the second four, the vowel is different:408(257)Vowel patterns in physical property I adjectivals
CV1C-V1Cbɛɗ-ɛ́d-‘delicate’lɪw-ɪ ́d-‘smooth’lyam-ád-‘powdery’ŋʊɓ-ʊ́d-‘brittle’CV1C-V2Cbɛf-ʊ́d-‘hefty’ɓal-ɪ ́d-‘glistening’ŋar-ʊ́d-‘crunchy’pɪl-ɔ́d-‘slippery’The reason for this discrepancy in vowel patterns is not clear. Any possible
explanation will hinge on a broader analysis of Ik verbal roots. In modern
Ik, many lexical items can function as either nouns or verbs, depending on
the suffixes they are given. When functioning as verbs, such lexemes are
analyzed as ending in a consonant. When functioning as nouns, they are
analyzed as ending in a vowel, as in tɔkɔb- ‘farm (v.)’ versus tɔkɔba- ‘farming
(n.)’. So it could be that adjectival forms in (257) preserve an older
morphology in which verbal roots also ended in vowels. This could mean
that these roots are actually bisyllabic and the physical property I suffix is
really just {-d-}. Then it would be coincidental that some roots have the
same vowel in both syllables while others did not.
But a) in keeping with the broader analysis of Ik verbal roots in this
grammar, and b) given that in the majority of instances of the physical
property I suffix the vowel is identical with the root vowel, this morpheme
is analyzed as having the structure {-V́d-}. This conclusion, of course, does
not preclude further investigation into this issue.
So more examples of physical property I adjectival verbs are given below to
illustrate the semantic vividness it expresses:409(258)Physical property I adjectivals
bɔf-ɔ́d-‘puffy’buf-úd-‘spongy’dab-úd-‘mushy’dɛʝ-ɛ́d-‘squat’ɡɔk-ɔ́d-‘stiff’ɡwid-íd-‘limber’ʝam-úd-‘velvety’kwitsʼ-íd-‘juicy’mɪl-ɪ ́d-‘shiny’na-úd-‘flimsy’nɛr-ɛ́d-‘wobbly’tsak-ád-‘watery’tsʼal-íd-‘oily’tuɗ-ád-‘leathery’wɪɲ-ɪ ́d-‘syrupy’wuʝ-úd-‘jiggly’ʃa-úd-‘paper-thin’In most cases, a corresponding noun root cannot be found for adjectivals
like the ones in (258), but there are a few exceptions. For, example, the
noun root bɛfá- ‘puff adder’ is clearly related to bɛf-ʊ́ d- ‘hefty’ since the puff
adder is quite a hefty snake. The noun root ɗosi- ‘gum, sap’ seems related to
ɗɔs-ɔ́d- ‘gummy’, despite a change in [ATR] value. One can speculate for
others, for example if and how ɡɔka- ‘larynx’ is related to ɡɔk-ɔ́d- ‘stiff’.
An interesting feature of adjectivals with the physical property I suffix is
that the adjectival root can be repeated as a sort of emphatic particle, as in:
(259)Liida lii.
lí-íd-aliiquiet-PHYS1- REALEMPHIt’s totally quiet.","[439, 440, 441]"
"5389.13.2 Complementation strategies
Besides the toimɛna-clause types described above, Ik also uses two further
complementation strategies: 1) nominalization and 2) clause chaining.
The verbal element of a complement clause can be nominalized instead of
appearing as a full finite verb. This is a commonly used complementation
strategy in Ik. Nominalized verbal complements can fill any core or noncore argument slot and thus take any required case ending. If the subject of
the nominalized verb needs to be specified, for example if it differs from the
main clause subject, it directly follows the complement verb in the genitive
case. And if the nominalized verb is transitive, then its object also follows it
(and the subject) in the genitive case. This means that if the complement
clause is transitive and has a different subject than the matrix clause, the
nominalized verb may be followed by two nouns in the genitive case.
For example in (200), the nominalized verb sáɓ-és ‘to kill (pl.)’ is the subject
(S) of the intransitive verb ɡaan-ón ‘to be bad’ and therefore takes the
nominative case. Within the nominalized complement clause, sáɓ-és is a
transitive verb with an object marked in the genitive case:
(200)Gaana saɓesa roɓae.
ɡaan-aV[sáɓ-és-aVA[roɓa-ᵉ]O]Sbad-REALkill[PL]-INF -NOMpeople-GENKilling people is bad (lit. ‘The killing of people is bad’).
The next example presents a nominalized transitive clause filling the object
slot of a matrix transitive clause. The transitive verb bol-és-úƙotᵃˊ ‘to stop
(doing something)’ has the nominalized clause ɪmɔɗɛsɪ ́á wicé as its object,
with ɪmɔɗ-ɛsˊ marked with the accusative case (since the subject of the main
verb in the matrix clause is 3-person). Then, within the complement clause
itself, the nominalized verb ɪmɔɗ-ɛsˊ ‘to deceive’ has its direct object encoded
as a possessive modifier in the genitive case:539(201)Boluƙotataa imoɗesia wice.
bol-uƙot-át-a-aVA[ɪmɔɗ-ɛsɪ ́-áVA[wicé-∅]O]Ostop-COMP-3PL-REAL-PRF deceive-INF -ACC children-GEN
They’ve stopped deceiving children.
Nominalized verbs can also fill peripheral argument slots. In the next
example, the nominalized verb ɪráb-ɛs ‘to harvest millet’ is filling the slot of
a peripheral argument in the dative case, denoting purpose:
(202)Botuo cikama rebeaƙok, irabesik.
bot-u-ocɪkám-árébe-aƙɔ-kᵋ[ɪráb-ɛsɪ ́-kᵋ]PERIPHERALmove-3SG-SEQwomen-NOM millet-inside-DAT harvest.millet-INF- DATAnd the women moved to the millet for harvesting (it).
The peripheral argument can be a complex complement clause appended to
a main clause as if it were the last in series of noun phrases. In this next
example, an entire transitive clause is encapsulated in multiple embedded
noun phrases that fill an oblique argument slot in a preceding matrix clause:
(203)...nda ʝa saɓesi ntsie loŋotae.
ńꜜda=ʝa[sáɓ-ésiVntsí-éAlɔŋɔ́tá-ᵋO]PERIPHERALand=ADVkill[PL]-INF [OBL]he-GENenemies-GEN...and then he killed the enemies (‘the killing of him of enemies’).
Finally, a nominalized complement clause can occur as a predicative
nominal in a verbless copula clause like the one in (204). This clause was
uttered to an elder as an explanation for the aches and pains of growing old:
(204)Dunesio ata dee.
dún-ési-oát-á=ꜜdééage-INF- COP FILL-NOM=ANPH.SG

The subject of a copula clause (CS) is also marked with the nominative case.
For a full list of examples, see §10.4. And the complement of a copula-ofidentity clause (CC) is marked with the oblique case:
(18)Mitima ngwa ɲot.
mɪt-ɪ ́m-áŋɡw-aCSbe-1PL.EXC-REAL we.EXC-NOMɲɔtᵓCC
men[OBL]We are men.
Lastly, in copula clauses, the copula subjects (CS) are marked with the
nominative and the copula complements (CC) with the copulative case:
(19)Jʼakamoo nk.
ʝák-ámo-oCCŋk-ᵃCSelders-SING-COP I-NOM
‘An elder am I.’237Thus are the core clausal arguments marked with case in Ik. When it comes
to non-core (peripheral) arguments, their relations to the verb are encoded
by five different cases (including the oblique). A representative example for
each non-core case is provided in the next sentences, with an indication of
some of the prototypical semantic roles they express. More detailed
treatments of each non-core (and core) cases follow in the sections below.

"6.3.6 Accusative
The accusative case suffix has the form {-ka}, and as such, is one of three Ik
case suffixes that consist of /k/ plus a vowel (the other two being the dative
and the copulative, described below). Potential parallels for this suffix are
widespread in the general Ethio-Sudanic language area. For Nilo-Saharan
accusative cases, “the widest-spread marker is a velar, occurring in at least
six of twelve families; it seems safe to assume this is a reflex of the protoform” (Dimmendaal 2010:30), which Ehret reconstructs as *-kɔ̀ (2001:203).
Besides Ik, Shabo (Nilo-Saharan or unclassified) has -kak or -k as an
object/accusative marker (Teferra 1991:9). And the Cushitic language Afar
marks objects on the verb with the morpheme -aka (Mahaffy n.d., p. 29).
The Ik accusative suffix has a L tone but may take a H tone according to the
stem’s tone melody (T7). It is one of the language’s opaque dominant
[+ATR] suffixes and thus can also be represented as {-ka+}. Any recessive
enclitic following the accusative suffix will surface as [+ATR].",[303]
"281Fifth, the dative is used to mark a peripheral argument that encodes the
Possessor of someone or something. In this function, the locative copula i‘be (somewhere)’ must be present, making the Possessor role a natural
extension of the Location role illustrated above.
(149)Iya kaudza bie tsʼoo.

Despite examples like the ones above, the more common way Ik expresses
possession with the locative copula i- is with the connector ńꜜda ‘and/with’,
as in iía ńꜜda ŋókítíná leɓets ‘I have (lit. ‘am with’) two dogs’.
Sixth, the dative case is used to mark peripheral arguments that encode
Purpose. In this function, the argument denoting purpose is usually a
nominalized verb (infinitive) declined in the dative case.

"7 Verbs
The Ik language’s second large, open word class besides nouns is verbs. This
chapter begins with an overview of verb roots (§7.1) and then moves on to
describe various verbal suffixes and verb-building mechanism (§7.2-§7.11).
In Ik, a verb is a word whose primary grammatical function is to be the
head of the predicate. As head of the predicate, a verb can take a variety of
inflectional affixes, including those for subject agreement, mood, modality,
valency, and aspect. A secondary grammatical function of the Ik verb is to
be the head of a noun phrase. For a verb to adopt this function, it must first
be nominalized with one of the language’s several nominalizing suffixes.
A prototypical member of the Ik verb class predicates the action, state,
location, or characteristic of its subject. Some concepts covered by an
adjective class in other languages—like color, size, and shape—are covered
by special adjectival verbs in Ik. And other concepts conveyed by nouns in
many languages are also encoded in Ik with nominalized verbs.
At an abstract lexical level, some words are neither verb nor noun until they
receive verbal or nominal affixes. These include words like deƙu- ‘quarrel’,
ƙaƙa- ‘hunt’, tɔkɔba- ‘cultivate’, and many others (see also §4 on nouns).
When such lexemes are used as verbs, they receive verbal affixes like subject
agreement markers. When they are used as nouns, they receive nominal
affixes like case markers. So while the word classes of verb and noun can
normally be clearly distinguished in Ik on the basis of syntax and semantics,
their boundaries do overlap with a fair number of lexemes.
A verbal word in Ik consists minimally of a verbal root plus one inflectional
affix. With the exception of reduplicated roots and fossilized prefixes, all
verbal inflectional and derivational affixes in Ik are suffixes.","[332, 333]"
"468The standard reply to both of these questions is bɪra ‘Nothing’. But if
persistent, one may further inquire:
(99)Ayuƙotaa toboŋa?
aĕ-iƙot-á-átɔbɔŋ-aready-COMP-REAL-PRFmaize.mush-NOMHas the posho gotten ready?
One can respond to (99) with sár ‘Not yet’, máá aĕiƙotⁱ ‘It hasn’t got ready’,
or máá naa ŋwɛɛ́sɪ́ᶦ ‘I didn’t grind (flour)’.
Another type of initial greeting, involving the imperative verb bɪ́rɛ́, became
something of a symbol of Ik beggarliness in Colin Turnbull’s (1972)
infamous book about the Ik called The Mountain People. A phrase often
repeated in the book—brinji lotop in his orthography (e.g., p. 56)—is usually
translated as ‘Give me tobacco’. Both in translation and in actual
pronunciation, this phrase sounds abrupt and a bit rude to a foreigner
unaccustomed to a begging/sharing culture. Though the stark intonation of
the phrase is unavoidable, there is a better translation than ‘Give me’.
The imperative bɪ́rɛ́ should not be translated simply as ‘Give me’ because
there is already another verb that means ‘give’: ma-, or me-et- in the
venitive. ‘Give me’ is the correct translation for the phrase meete ɲ́cikᵉ,
where ɲ́ cikᵉ ‘to me’ is the dative case form of the first person singular
pronoun. So ‘Give me tobacco’ would be Meete lɔ́tɔ́ɓa ɲcikᵉ. As discussed
back in §6.3.3, in the phrase brinji lotop—more accurately written as bɪ́rɛ́ ɲ́ ci
lɔ́tɔ́ɓᵓ—the object of the imperative is ɲ́ ci ‘me’ in the oblique case, while lɔ́tɔ́ɓ
‘tobacco’ is an adjunct argument in the instrumental case. If the grammar is
any indication, then the phrase means ‘X me with tobacco’. As best as can be
gathered from its singular use in this greeting of request, the verb bɪ́rɛ́ ɲ́ cⁱ
approximates to something like ‘Help me’, ‘Relieve me’, or ‘Avail me’.","[499, 500]"
"7.2.4 Patientive
The patientive suffix {-amá-} nominalizes verbs—mostly transitive ones but
also intransitive ones. Etymologically, it may be related to the word ámá‘person’—perhaps as the semi-grammaticalized agentive (§4.3.4)—and/or
the human singulative {-Vma-}. The patientive suffix’s LH tone melody is
invariable, regardless of the preceding root. It is also one of the language’s
opaque [+ATR] morphemes and as such can be represented as {-amá+ -}.
This means that the case suffixes that follow it will also be [+ATR].
This morpheme {-amá-} is called the ‘patientive’ here because in most cases
it encodes the semantic Patient of a transitive verb. Elsewhere it has been
described as expressing the notions of ‘potentiality’ or ‘feasability’ (Heine &327König 1996:98). With this suffix, the patient is given a rather stative passive
role that is not easy to gloss in English. One strategy is to use the English
suffix ‘-able’ in the gloss, as in an ‘X-able thing’. As a nominalizer, this suffix
attaches to a verb stem and creates a noun that combines the meaning of
the transitive verb stem and its patient. Examples of patientives formed
from transitive verbs include the following:
(55)Patientive nominalizer
Transitive
abut-i-ésPatientive
‘to sip’→abut-i-amá-‘sippable thing’dzíɡw-es‘to sell’→dzíɡw-amá-‘buyable thing’eréɡ-es‘to use’→eréɡ-amá-‘useable thing’isuɗ-es‘to lie’→isuɗ-amá-‘nonsense’me-et-és‘to give’→me-et-amá-‘gift’ŋƙ-ɛ́s‘to eat’→ŋƙ-amá-‘eatable thing’óɡoɗ-és‘to keep’→óɡoɗes-amá-‘leftovers’tɔkɔ́b-ɛs‘to farm’→tɔkɔb-amá-‘arable land’In addition to the examples in (55), other nouns formed with the patientive
nominalizer fall into two peculiar semantic groups: 1) food items and 2)
small objects. These groups are exemplified in (56) and (57):
(56)Patientive food items
íbots-amá-‘milk cream’ízot-amá-‘solid food with gravy’ɪlɪr-amá-‘food without gravy’ʝul-amá-‘chunks of leftover meat’ƙɛƙɛr-amá-‘mixture of honey and pounded white-ants’tɔƙ-amá-‘pure white ants’tʊɗʊt-amá-‘solid food’328(57)Patientive small objects

found (e.g. ƙɛ́ƙɛ́r- ‘mix honey and white-ants’ and bɪtɪt- ‘produce’), for most
others, no independent transitive verb has yet been identified. But this could
be a gap in research. There is also one example where an intransitive verb
takes this suffix: ɓar- ‘to be sour’ nominalized as ɓar-amá- ‘sour porridge’. So
although the term ‘patientive’ seems to reasonably represent this morpheme
today, in the past its meaning and usage could have been more diverse.
As a nominalizing suffix, {-amá-} is inflected fully for case, as shown below
for the word ŋƙ-amá- ‘eatable thing’:

The rare suffix {-VƙV-} is both a nominalizer and a verbalizer. As a
nominalizer, it gives a verb the meaning ‘substance of X verb’. As a
verbalizer, it gives a noun the meaning ‘to issue X substance’. That both
vowels (V) in {-VƙV-} should be the same seems like a heuristic for tracking
down instances of the suffix in the lexicon. So far the only unambiguous
cases contain either /a/ or /o/. The suffix’s tone is L but may bear H tone
spread from the verb root (T7). Here are the only four clear examples:

some morphological variation, i.e. /e/→/n/ in ntsʼ-áƙá- ‘feces’ and
/w(a)/→/ʊ/ in kʊts-áƙá- ‘urine’. This variation, plus the rarity of the suffix
at all, suggests that the substantive is a very old morpheme within Ik.
Other lexemes ending in the sequence -VƙV include those in (60). Whether
they involve the substantive suffix or not is not known because
corresponding roots without the suffix have not yet been identified:

Besides the nominalizers described in the last five sections, Ik also has one
strictly verbalizing derivative. This verbalizer, the ‘behaviorative’ {-nanesi-},
creates a verb out of a noun and has the meaning of ‘to behave with the
characteristics of X noun’. The suffix is complex, consisting of -nan on the
one hand and -esi- on the other. The latter is probably a distinct
grammaticalization of the Ik proto-morpheme *-ɛsɪ that has led to the 1)
transitive infinitive suffix, 2) the imperfective aspect suffix, and 3) the
intentional modality suffix. Because {-nanesi-} conveys an ongoing, habitual
sense to the denominal verb, it seems more closely related to the meaning of
the imperfective aspectual instantiation of the proto-morpheme. Since
nothing more is known about *-nan, the behaviorative verbalizer is treated
as a historically complex but synchronically composite verbal suffix.
The behaviorative suffix’s tone is L, but a H tone may spread to its first
syllable from the nominal stem (T7). Because it contains /a/, {-nanesi-}
prevents its own [+ATR] harmony from spreading back to a [-ATR] stem.
The following table presents a sample of nouns verbalized by {-nanesi-}:

The andative denotes motion away from a deictic center, while the venitive
denotes motion toward it. The deictic center is usually the speaker but can
be another place, provided the speaker and hearer share the reference.
Directionals are an integral and important part of Ik verbal semantics but as
much so as aspectual markers as directional (§7.9.2-7.9.3). The directionals
and their aspectual counterparts are highly but not fully productive;
speakers have an intuition for which combinations are natural. In nearby
Turkana, directional suffixes are only found on dynamic verbs (Dimmendaal
1983:110). Not so in Ik: They are found on all verb types. The table below
illustrates the directional nuances expessed by these two suffixes:
(62)Ik directional suffixes

The suffix {-ʊƙɔtɪ ́-} communicates motion away from a deictic center. It is
called ‘andative’ here in keeping with Kuliakist tradition, but ‘itive’ would
be another appropriate lable. The Ik andative has a promising parallel in the
Surmic language Didinga’s itive suffix -oð (De Jong 2004:150). The
sequence /-ʊƙ-/ within {-ʊƙɔtɪ ́-} calls to mind the substantive suffix {-VƙV},
but at present there is nothing obvious linking the two semantically.","[358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363]"
"4478.3AdverbsIk has a small, closed class of words that can be called ‘adverbs’ on the basis
that they are mostly monomorphemic and can modify whole clauses. Some
adverbs convey the manner of an action, while others relate the epistemic
attitude of the speaker. Other still defy any semantic characterization.
The Ik manner adverbs include the following:
(45)Ik manner adverbs
ɗɛmʊsʊ‘quickly’hɪ ́ɪ ́ʝɔ‘slowly, carefully’(also ɗamʊsʊ)ʝɪ ́kɪ ́‘totally, really’ʝíiki‘always’kɔ́ntɪ ́ákᵋ‘straightaway’(cf. kɔnɪ́- ‘one’)mʊka‘completely, forever’(also a noun mʊka-páka‘until, indefinitely’(fr. Swahili mpaka)zuku‘very, especially’(also in Nyang’í)A few of the adverbs in (45) undergo the deletion of their final consonant
segment in clause-medial environments. For example, ɗɛmʊsʊ ‘quickly’ may
be pronounced as ɗɛmʊʊ and kɔ́ntɪ́ákᵋ ‘straightaway’ as kɔ́ntɪ́ɛ́ɛ.́
Other adverbs relate the epistemic attitude of the speaker, for example:
(46)Ik epistemic adverbs
=ʝá‘just, then’(an enclitic)tsábo‘apparently’tsamʊ‘exactly, of course’(also a noun tsamʊ́ - ‘freeness’tsʼɔɔ‘probably’(marker of distended present)A handful of other adverbial particles fall together into the following group
unmarked by any particular semantic cohesiveness:448(47)Other Ik adverbs
ɛɗá‘only, alone’=ʝɪkɛ‘also, too’kɪ ́ná‘and then’naɓó‘again’=ɲá(k)a‘just’toni‘even’The adverb ʝɪkɛ ‘also, too’ undergoes non-final deletion and vowel
assimilation such that ʝɪɪ is an allomorph commonly heard in the language.
The adverb naɓó ‘again’ is cognate with Teso-Turkana nabo of the same
meaning. In both languages, it can also be used in the sense of ‘moreover’.
Adverbial functions are often handled in Ik by nouns and verbs. For
example, nouns in the instrumental or dative cases can be used to modify a
predicate. In (48) below, the nominalized verb ɪsɪ́lɔ́n ‘to be peaceful’ is given
the instrumental case to elaborate on the manner in which the person was
settled down. Then in (49), the noun kédi- ‘way’ is put in the dative case,
also to express the manner in which it was getting cloudy:
(48)Zeƙwitetesa bia isilon.
zɛƙw-ɪt-ɛt-ɛ́s-ábi-aɪsɪ ́l-ɔ́n-ʷsit-CAUS-INCH-INT -REALyou.SG-ACC be.peaceful-INF-INSHe will settle you down peacefully (i.e. with peace).
(49)Kupetaa kedia gaan.
kup-et-á-ákédi-eɡaan-∅cloudy-INCH-REAL-PRFway-DATbad-REALIt’s getting dangerously cloudy (i.e in a bad way).
Many time expressions used adverbially are in fact nouns in the
instrumental case with the suffix {-ɔ}, for example those in (50). For more
on Ik time expressions, skip ahead to §8.9.","[478, 479, 480]"

thus inflect fully for case. Some others, like ńtɛ́- ɛ́nɪ́- ‘which (sg)?’ are
compound nouns. The adverbial interrogative ńtí ‘how’ is an invariable
particle, and the words kɪtɔ́ɔś - ‘what quality?’ and taná- ‘how many?’ are
both intransitive verbs.
The word ndo- ‘who’ can be pluralized with the possessive plural suffix
making ndo-íní- ‘who (pl.)?’. In isolation, ńtá is the word used for ‘where?’,
while ndaí- is used when a case inflection is required. This latter form is
likely a combination of the proto-interrogative *nd/nt- and aí- ‘side, place’
but should probably now be considered lexicalized (see §8.2.4 for a
discussion of aí-’s role in the formation of locative demonstratives).
The singular and plural forms of ‘which’ are also based on the protointerrogative morpheme *nd/nt- plus the possessum pronominal -ɛnɪ ́-. The
concept of ‘when’ in Ik is usually expressed through a combination of ńtɛ́ɛ́nɪ́- ‘which’ plus the appropriate unit of time as its modifier in the genitive
case, as in ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɔ́-ɔ ɲásáatɪ́ ‘which hour?’ or ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɔ́-ɔ aráɡwanɪ́ ‘which
month?’. A shortened form has arisen alongside ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɔ́-ɔ ódowi ‘which
day?’—ńtó-odów ‘when (which day)?’ (noted by Heine & König 1996:120).","[561, 562]"
"Unquestionably, the morphological distinction is there, yet the semantic
bases for it have not yet fully come to light. The table below presents the
two groups of verb forms defined by whether they contain /-a/ or /-ɪ,i/:

end in the vowel /ɪ,i/, including the 2SG suffix {-ɪ ́dɪ-} shown in (96). So the
2SG suffix in the first four verbs in (96) must have had its final vowel
substracted by a morpheme {-a}. The subtractive behavior shown by {-a} in
those examples is identical to that of the nominative case suffix which
subtracts a noun’s final vowel. Since the nominative case is marked rather
than unmarked in Ik, the forms containing {-a} in (96) are also analyzed
here as marked. Similarly, just as the oblique case preserves the lexical form
of a noun (i.e. is unmarked), so the last five verbs in (96) preserve the
underlying form of the 2SG suffix {-ɪ ́dɪ-} leaving them unmarked also.",[377]
"4578.5PrepositionsThe ‘preposition’ category is used here as a catch-all for eight random words
that are nonetheless found pre-posed before nouns. The meanings and
functions of prepositions in other languages are in large part handled by the
Ik relational nouns listed back in §4.3.8. Ik prepositions come from a variety
of sources, and each require a particular case on the noun that follows them.
Of the eight prepositions shown in (70), only naaƙwaa is properly
considered a noun as evidenced by its ability to take case suffixes:
