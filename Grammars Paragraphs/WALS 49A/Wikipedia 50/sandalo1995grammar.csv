"Many languages that have a free constituent order also havemorphologically marked case. In such languages case markers are like English prepositions in that they assignsemantic roles. Thus. several authors prefer to label these elements as semantic role markers or semantic case

"A morpheme such as -d: can occur with a subject pronoun(nominative) in unaccusative clauses (310) or object pronoun (accusative) in transitive clauses (311). Allsubjects (i.e. subjects of transitive clauses (which only appear if the object is third-person). unergative
subjects, unaccusative subjects. and subjects of passives and reflexives) are in the nominative case in
Kadiwéu. Objects are marked by a different set of pronominals.",[130]
"One possible answerthat can be found within Government & Binding theory is that case licenses the presence of grammatical
arguments. Thus, the function of those morphemes could be assignment of structural case. But Kadiwéu
presents evidence against this interpretation.",[130]

"Although transitive verbs normally contain object markers. a third-person object is usually not marked. because
this is the lowest in the hierarchy. Therefore. when a transitive verb has a subject marker rather than an object
marker, one understands that the object is a third-person.
Since second person is higher than first person. a transitive verb whose subject is second person and whose
object is Isg can also be marked by a subject prefix rather than an object prefix. In this case, the subject marker
must be followed by the semantic case marker -d: 'theme’.",[61]

arguments are an empty category pro that occupies the projections of the verb. Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting

affixes co-occur with elements which are roughly tike English prepositions in that they assign semantic
roles: -d: 'theme', -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -ma ‘benefactive’, -g ‘goal’, -/okom '‘adessive', -k '‘allative’.
Nouns can never co-occur with such semantic role assigners. The fact that bound pronominals, rather than
nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that Kadiwéu is a pronominal argument language
of the Jelinek rather than the Baker type. In addition, the results of several syntactic tests support the
analysis —passivization,recursivity, coreference,anaphora,quantifiers, and the behaviorof wu-interrogatives ~- support the analysis.
This dissertation also shows that the major lexical categories present in Kadiwéu are nouns and verbs.
Kadiwéu lacks prepositions entirely. I show that structures previously analyzed as containing prepositional
phrases are in fact serial verb constructions.
Finally, I present the criteria I used to classify the Kadiwéu roots as nouns or verbs. Verbs are those
elements which are valent; that is, that have an argument structure. Valency representation contains
information about the number of arguments a verb requires
and the semantic nature
of those arguments. I
determine the valency of a Kadiwéu root according to (i) the meaning of a bare root and (ii) the meaning
of a stem consisting of the reot plus a valency suffix. Although Kadiwéu has valent roots, it has no
transitive roots.","[6, 7]"
"In addition to the basicdescriptive study, I have investigated selected topics that bear on theoretical issues. In particular, I provide
evidence that pronominal clitics and affixes are arguments in Kadiwéu and that nominal phrases are optionally
adjoined to the sentence. Here I will briefly explain the significance of my results.
Kadiweéu has the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language: any nominal phrase can be omitted.
nominal phrases are freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb, and some discontinuous nominal
expressions are allowed. Jelinek 1984 explains the properties of nonconfigurational languages by proposing that
languages set the elements which can work as verbal arguments. According to Jelinek. pronominal clitics and
affixes are the arguments in nonconfigurational languages: nominal phrases are adjuncts. and therefore they can
assume free order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally accepted, however. For instance, Baker
(1994) argues that nominal phrases are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he denies that pronominals are arguments in this
language. According to Baker, the arguments are an empty category pro that occupies the projections of the verb.
Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting Jelinck's hypothesis that pronominals can indeed be arguments in some
languages. First, pronominal clitics and affixes co-occur with elements which are roughly like English prepositions
in that they assign semantic roles: -d: 'theme', -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -lo ~ -ma ‘benefactive'. -g ‘goal’. -lokom
‘adessive', and -k ‘allative'. Nounsnever co-occur with such semanticrole assigners. Thefact that boundpronominals, rather than nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that Kadiwéu is a pronominal
argument language of the Jelinek rather than the Baker type. In addition, the results of several syntactic tests. for
instance passivization --- which affects pronominals but not nominal phrases -~ support the hypothesis.
This work has implications for studies of language typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers' 1994
prediction that transitivity is assigned at the syntactic level in all languages whose arguments are pronominals.
rather than nominal phrases or an empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. Kadiwéu roots resemble nouns of betterknown languages in that they are not transitive; that is, they cannot assign theta-roles to complements. Thomason
at al. 1994 argue that transitivity and valency must be distinguished. The facts of Kadiwéu support this proposal.
Although Kadiwéu has valent roots, it has no transitive roots. Transitivity is introduced via morphemes
function as light verbs (Grimshaw & Mester 1988).",[14]

This result has implications for language typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers' 1994
prediction that transitivity is assigned at the syntactic level in all languages whose argumentsarepronominals, rather than nominal phrases or an empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. I have proposed a
parametric variation based on an insight in Fukui & Speas 1986 to account for pronominal argument
languages. I argued that these languages are languages in which lexical categories do not project. On this
hypothesis, clauses in pronominal argument languages are formed by raising of a valent lexical item to
adjoin a functional category that functions as a light verb. Light verbs enable valent elements to thetaassign.","[136, 137]"
"*7The parametric variation proposed here is substantially different the one in Baker 1994. My proposalcan account for the existence of languages in which pronominals, rather than nominal phrases. are verbal

do, they cannot be derived from the same parametric variation. Baker (personal communication,1995)mentions that there are at leat two types of nonconfigurational languages: (a) languages which have empty
categories pro as arguments and whose verbs are overtly marked by agreement (Mohawk),and (b)languages whose verbal arguments are pro, but whose verbs are not marked by agreement morphemes(Jiwarli). Jiwarli does not have bound pronominals, but it shares a remarkable number of features with

binary feet is impossible in stems containing an odd number of syllables: in such a stem. a syllable would be left
over. A foot formed by a single syllable is called a degenerate foot. According to Hayes 1995, there are two types of
languages concerning degenarate feet: (i) those which severely ban degenerate feet, and (ii) those which tolerate
degenerate feet. I argue that Noble Kadiwéu. unlike Non-noble Kadiwéu. bans degenerate feet.
A severe ban on degenerate feet makes predictions about possible word shapes. If a quantity-insensitive
language allow no degenerate feet at all. then there can be no monosyllables in this language.","[41, 42]"

"4.4.1. Valency. The term valency is derived from chemistry and is often used in linguistics to refer
to the number and type of bonds which the verb may form with a number of dependent elements referred
to as arguments (Crystal1985). This definition, however, is ambiguous, because transitivity can bedefined in the same way. In this work, I use valency to refer exclusively to the syntactically relevant
components of meaning specified in the Lexicon of a language.
I will represent valency using predicate decomposition of a traditional LCS, although valency as meant
by Thomason et. al is probably more complex than a LCS. I frame valency using LCSs because they can
capture the facts that I discuss here. Thus, rather than attempting to develop a theory of the lexical
representations, I make only those assumptions that are necessary for the issues under investigation.",[119]
"Nonconfigurational languages pose well-known problems for linguistic theory. The existence of free word order

"Cariban,Arauan,and Candoshilanguages:Facundes 1995 shows that genitive classifiers marking inalienable possession are also present in Apurina. an
Arawakan language spoken in the western Amazonian area. There are three types of possessed nouns in the
Waikunian languages: Class I. nouns that must be possessed and do not take a prefix n-; Class II. nouns that can
be possessed and that take the prefix n-: Class II, nouns that are never possessed, and refer to things from nature.
e.g. storm, rain, and river. The prefix n- is a classifier that marks alienably possessed nouns. Kadiwéu nouns are
further organized into subclasses marked by classifier suffixes.",[50]
"Amongthe Waikurianlanguages, only Kadiwéu has a set of semantic role markers.
The structure of the Kadiwéu noun resembles noun structure in other Waikunian languages as well as in most
western South American languages. The presence of classifiers/nominalizers marking inalienable possession seems
to be an areal feature of the languages of western lowland South America. According to Payne 1990. classifiers
markinginalienably possessednouns are present in Maipuran.",[50]
"(42)aObserve in 42 that the vowel is not merely lengthened: instead it is reduplicated into a new syllable. The
syllabic trochee languages which ban degenerate feet studied by Hayes allow no words consisting of a single light
syllable; however,they do allow monosyllabic words consisting of a heavy syllable. Hayes thus proposes thatsyllabic-trochee languages characteristically employ a minimal-word constraint which takes heavy syllables as
proper feet. Kadiwéu conterexemplifies Hayes’ generalization, since all stems containing an odd number of
syllables, even those which contain a long vowel, must be expanded in order to be well-formed. The wave forms inFigure 2 illustrates the analysis with the monosyllables ve: ‘he died' and ye 'my belly’. which show the same
reduplication pattern. Each peak in the wave represents one independent vowel. Long vowels appear as long peaks.",[42]

This proposal. however, relies on the assumption that theta-roles are assigned to noun phrases. But we

verbal arguments in Kadiwéu; that is, theta-roles are assigned verb-internally. This entails that an elementReproduced

"'0In active systems the agent argument of a transitive verb is marked like the sole argument of anunergative verb. which is also an agent semantically. Nonagent arguments (and also possessives) are

nonagents.",[142]
"!24In more recent work Chomsky’s uniform bar-level hypothesis. according to which the number of bars
for maximal projection is uniform across categories, has been questioned. For instance. Fukui & Speas
(1986) argue that functional categories are limited to a single specifier position and a single complement
position. By contrast, lexical categories project recursively as long as they have theta-roles to assign. In
other words. the projection of lexical categories has been assumed to correlate with their capacity to assign
theta-roles. Now, there are several pieces of evidence that verbs cannot assign theta-roles in Kadiwéu. Ifthe projection of lexical categories is indeed tied to their ability to assign theta-roles, that entails that
Kadiwéu verbs do not project.
My proposal is an extended version of Fukui & Speas' 1986 proposal. Fukui & Speas base their
parametric variation on the presence vs. absence of functional categories (FC). They argue that Japanese
lacks functional categories except for a defective INFL, which is defective in that it is not able to project.","[133, 134]"
