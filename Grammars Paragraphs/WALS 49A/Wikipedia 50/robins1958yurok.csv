"When they occur between an article and a noun (14.42).
In a few fixed phrases (14.43).
Only a limited number of the preverbal particles were found occurring in
constructions 2 and 3, and all three of these constructions are far less com mon than the particle + verb construction.
The particles are listed below with examples illustrating their uses and
meanings.
14.2ParticleswithVerbsPreverbal particles occur singly or in groups of two or more before the
verbs to which they refer. They may be disjoined from the verb by intervening adverbs, adverbial phrases, numeral words, or pronouns.
Only
co(?) (14.21 No. 37) was found disjoined from its verb by a noun. Almost
all the particles can be used singly; in groups their relative order to one
another is not fixed.
Yurok verbs may be used in sentences, as has been seen, without any
preverbal particles, and the syntactic functions of the particle + verb complexes are equivalent to those of verbs by themselves. The particles maybe used with any verb form,inflected or noninflected,in the verbalsystem,though certain particles have specific functions when used with certain
specific verb forms; such functions are described below under the particles
concerned.
Broadly speaking, the meanings that may be given to these particles in
the Yurok language correspond to those ascribed in many other languages
to tense and aspect forms of verbs, as well as to rather more specific
meanings for which adverbial words are used. The preverbal particles,used both singly and in groups,provide the Yurok language with a flexibleand sensitive range of verbal expressions, comparable to that achieved by
a complex tense and aspect system in other languages.
The particles are listed below singly and then in groups, the same order
of listing being used throughout. Examples of all the groups occurring in
my notes are given, and the number of examples given with each particle
or group of particles is intended to be some indication of their relative frequency of occurrence in the language as I recorded it.
An attempt is made to give a single translation to each particle listed.
‘n some cases this is relatively easy; in others only a general summary of
ts usages in sentences can be given. In each case it must be borne in mind
that especially for words of ti.is type that do not normally occur in sentences
2xcept as part of larger constructions, isolated translation meanings can
-epresent no more than general abstractions from the various contributions
che words make to the meanings of the total sentences in which they occur.

"LEXICONLEXICON
In the Yurok-English section entries are made in an order corresponding as
nearly as possible to the order of the English alphabet. Words appearing inthe language in more than one morphological form are cited by their stems
(9.1); in cases where more than one stem form is used in the total paradigm
of the word, it is cited under its most commonly occurring stem. Where the
various forms of words are sufficiently indicated by the form of the stem
and the designation of the word class to which it belongs, the relevant information given in the grammatical sections is not repeated here; on the other
hand all irregular forms or exceptions to the general rules are listed under
the relevant stems.
Where a verb stem is entered with the final part bracketed, this indicates
that the unbracketed part is used as a noninflected verb (13.112) with the
same meaning as the longer inflected forms of the inflected stem.
Thus
skewok(sim-), to love, means that skewok is used as the equivalent of the
inflectedformsskewoksimek,I love,formed on the stem skewoksim-;skewoksi?m,and pla?ay(-),he,sheloves,etc.,to be big (animals and birds)means that plu?.zy is used as the equivalent of the inflected forms pl4?.4?y,
it is big, pla?ayei, they are big, etc., formed on the stem pla?.ay-.
Among the inflected verbals the following subclasses of stems are found;
their inflections, where they differ from the general verbal inflections, are
described in the grammatical sections listed below, and apart from irregu-larities within these subclasses they are not referred to individually in the
dictionary,as thecitation of thestemmakesclear thesubclass(if any)towhich the word belongs:

"Separation of the prefix from the verb
The pronominal prefixes are normally inseparable from the verb stem,
but in some cases where the verb is endocentrically expanded by an adverb,

particles, the prefix may be added to one of these words in the verbal group.",[69]

"WORD
9.1STRUCTURE
MorphologyThe morphology of Yurok can best be analyzed by setting up word stemstoserve as a basis for the description of the various morphological formations
In some cases the stem will have the same shape as the word itself in some
grammatical form; in others it will be an abstraction from the various gran
matical forms of the word. The forms of most words can be analyzed by
reference to a single stem form, but in a few cases separate forms of the
stem have to be set up. These are indicated in the relevant sections.
The morphological processes? employed in Yurok grammar comprise
Prefixation, Infixation, Inflection,* Vowel Harmony, and Internal Vocalic
Alternation,
Prefixation and infixation operate in both nominals and verbals, as well
as with some words of other classes. Infixation and, to a lesser extent,
vocalic alternation operate principally with verbals, playing a restricted
part elsewhere in the grammar. Vowel harmony operates in certain words
of both nominal and verbal classes.
The prefixes comprise the Pronominal Prefixes (11.35, 13.141.4). Ther.
is one infix,
-eg- and its variants (13.151), used generally with verbals ar
also with a few nouns and adverbs and with one preverbal particle, so’
The inflectional elements are numerous and of very frequent employment,
principally with verbals.
Vowel harmony applies to certain prefixes, infixes, and inflections,
according to the vocalic and consonantal structure of the word stem. In the
prefixes and inflections to which it is applicable, vowel harmony is in gen
eral a facultative, not an obligatory, process; where applicable to infixes

16.1GeneralPrepositions immediately preceding nominals, nominal groups, or adverbs
form groups with the syntactic function of adverbs. Yurok prepositions are
few in number, and mostly of very generalized meanings, which are ustalls
further specified for translation purposes by the verb in the sentence.
The
construction nominal + adverb with pronominal prefix (15.4) to some extent
takes the place of many of the prepositional phrases of European languages.
Nouns following prepositions may, but need not, be in the locative form; the
comitative forms of pronouns may be used after prepositions.
Several of the prepositions are the same in form and of related meaning
to certain preverbal particles; but their quite different syntactic function,
even when compared to the preverbal particle + noun constructions (14.4),
makes it necessary to set them up as a separate category in the grammar
of the language.","[155, 156]"
"6. WORDS
The word units set up in this analysis of Yurok are based primarily on syntactical and morphological criteria. Convenient units of relative independence
as elements of sentence structure and abstracted for the grammatical analysis of the language are not delimitable in terms of phonological criteria. Consequently the word unit is not used here as part of the means for establishing
or defining phonemic units. The spaces between words in the examples and
texts are of grammatical rather than phonological significance.
However, certain phonological features are associated with these grammatical word units. Words of more than one syllable are characterized byan optional slight lengthening of the initial syllable. This lengthening varies
in its occurrence; phonetically it may take the form of a slight lengthening
of the vowel in the syllable, or of a slight lengthening of the first consonant
of the second syllable where this consonant is intervocalic (e.g., tepo:, tree,
[tep-o-]), inwhich case the lengthened consonant may be regarded phonetical-ly as ambisyllabic,In many instances both processesare employedin thesame word. Phonemic distinctions of vowel length are not obscured by this
facultative phonetic vowel lengthening. It is in these slightly lengthened initial syllables of words that e is most commonly pronounced [e¥] (4.2), andintervocalicwas vy)second syllable.
Apart from the(5),(4.1),when occurring as initial consonant of thephonologicallynonpermittedsequenceswhich are excluded by general limitations of Yurokmentionedcertain other sequences are excluded from the phonological

have bipersonal, reflexive, reciprocal, and complete passive paradigms.
Inflected verbs may be classified as e-class or o-class, according to tkseries of inflections used,e ando respectively being the commonestvowsin the two series of inflections. A very few verbs fall into an a-class.
e-class verbs are more numerous than o-class verbs, but a number of
the most commonly used verbs belong to the o-class; o-class verbs tend to
have more variations and irregularities in their inflections than e-class
verbs.
13.112
Noninflected verbs
Besides the inflected verbs, there are many words syntactically equivaler
to them, and admitting the pronominal prefixes and the -eg- infix in the sami
manner as they do, but without any inflections. These are designated noninflected verbs, and may be used as the syntactical equivalents for all persons
of any of the categories of the verb that are differentiated by inflection in the
inflected verbs, except that the same noninflected verb cannot be used both
actively and passively. Noninflected verbs are formally neither transitive
nor intransitive, though in translation and syntactic employment some correspond to inflected transitive verbs and others to intransitive verbs.
Many Yurok verbs have both an inflected and a noninflected stem.
This
latter is usually identical with the first part of the inflected stem, though in
certain verbs there are small differences. Verbs of this class are indicated
by bracketing the latter part of the inflected stem.cwin(kep-)areto talkThe noninflected stems of verbs which in their longer, inflected stems

"ANDas isolateswiththeThe operation of the ruleis dealt with below(11.351,INTONATIONStress and pitch are not used as lexically differential features in Yurok, but
are rather to be regarded as features of tempo and style. In connected spee:
most words of more than one syllable have one syllable prominent, by its
being on a higher pitch than adjacent syllable and sometimes bearing louder
stress as well; but the same word may have any one of its syllables prominent according to the style, tempo, and rhythmic pattern of the sentence.
Monosyllabic words may also be prominent, but this is rarely the case except with monosyllabic nouns and verbs,
Where a prominent syllable has a long vowel, this vowel may be somewhat overlengthened and on a markedly higher pitch, this being particularly
noticeable when prominence falls on monosyllabic words containing long
vowels.
The basic intonation in Yurok is a falling sequence of prominent syllables
with the nonprominent syllables at a lower pitch. The sequences end in eithe
a final falling pitch or a final low pitch preceded by a somewhat higher pitch
on the penultimate syllable. The final falling pitch often occurs with imperatival sentences, but is not confined to them. In long sentences the sequence
may rise once or twice (apart from the higher pitch of prominent monosyllables mentioned above), before the final fall.
Questions often begin rather higher than statements, or rise to a higher
pitch early in the sentence, but there is no specific intonation associated
with interrogative sentences.
Medial pause in sentences is accompanied by a mid-level pitch on the las:syllable before the pause.
In excited, angry, or emphatic speech, prominent syllables are higher
pitch and more loudly stressed than is usual in the normal speech of the
speaker.inCHAPTERII: GRAMMAR8. WORD CLASSES

"YUROKPHONETIC
4.1LANGUAGE
DESCRIPTIONSConsonantsThe nonglottalized plosives and affricates are voiceless;in syllable finalposition they are aspirated except in connected speech, where they may be
unexploded. The glottalization of the glottalized series is never strong, and
in connected speech these consonants are often pronounced with the samearticulation as the corresponding nonglottalized consonants,though the dis-tinction between the two series is normally maintained in slower speech and
in the utterance of isolated forms. In the examples and texts these conso-nants are always transcribed as glottalized.’It will be seen from the gram-mar and dictionary that the glottalized consonants play a considerable part
in Yurok morphology, but are relatively infrequent as compared with the
nonglottalized series in the lexicon of the language.
k and K vary in articulatory position between prevelar and postvelar according to the frontness or backness of the adjacent vowels, particularly the
vowel in the same syllable. In syllable final position after e or i, k and Kmay be released with a slight Y-offglide.kahkah_sturgeonKinepeK I

The numeral system is basically decimal, but in the first decad,numerals1 to 4 and sometimes 10 exhibit a different structure from the remainder,
which are compounded of an element which is the same for all noun classes
and a second element which is the same for all numbers.
The numeral forms for the same number are differentiated for each classby their terminations

Forms that are identical with those of the unipersonaldescribedinconjugation alwayshave the object expressed, unless the context makes it unnecessary.
The third person object forms (1 s. 3s., 2s. 3s., 1 pl. 38s., 2pl. 38.,
1s. 3 pl.) are only used when the object refers to a human being; otherwise
unipersonal forms are used. One informant contrasted the sentences nekkemeyonemesek,I will take him home(e.g.,a child) with nek kemeyonemekyo?, I will take him home, used with reference to a human being when he is
incapable of resistance or action normal to a human being (e.g., a person
drunk, ill, or injured). For this informant there was a stylistic effect in
using a form appropriate to an animal or an inanimate object when the object was in fact a human being.
It was, however, quite common,
particularly with informants having less
command of the language,
for unipersonal forms to be substituted for
specific bipersonal forms or passive derived forms without any observedstylistic effect.yo? kelac 90 no-?rep
