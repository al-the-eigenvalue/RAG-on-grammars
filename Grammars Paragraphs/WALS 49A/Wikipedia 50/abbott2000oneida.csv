4.4.3, Body parts are noun roots that usually require a locative suffix and a subjective
pronominal prefix for the possessor. An objective pronominal prefix is seen as counter to the
inalienable possession of body parts.

5 Pronouns
Most of the pronoun work of Oneida is done with the pronominal prefixes in the verb and
to a lesser extent the possessive prefixes on nouns, but there are some independent pronouns
that are used for particular emphasis or contrast. These are used unmarked for number:
first person: ni, ni?i, i
secondperson:ni‘sé, ni?isé,i*séthird person: ne4.4.6 Number terms are usually single morphemes. Counting is based on 10 and makes use
of a special morpheme yawa‘/é for ‘-teen’ and a verb -ahsa- for multiples of ten.

"4.3.9 Adjectives - In Oneida adjectives are really verb roots many of which incorporate thenoun they are describing. Such “adjectives” can inflect with the verb morphology for tense
and aspect. Many of these adjectival verb roots can also be used with an incorporated nounbut without an aspect suffix. In such cases an objective pronominal prefix refers to the
possessor of the incorporated noun; subjective pronominal prefixes are used when the
pronominal and the incorporated noun refer to the same individual; or a neuter pronominal
prefix is used when no possessor is mentioned. These neuter prefixes, however, are the type
attached to nouns (o- or ka- or zero) rather than those attached to verbs (yo- or ka or Ww).

semantic categories and there are some patterns worth noting.",[28]
"Prepronominal | | Pronominal
PrefixesPrefixesVerbAspectStemsSuffixes3.2 Pronominal Prefixes - The pronominal component contains a rich set of prefixes that
distinguish four genders, three numbers, three persons (plus an exclusive/inclusive distinction),
and two semantic (or thematic) roles, typically an agent/patient distinction. If all of these
distinctions were everywhere exploited, there would be nearly two thousand prefixes in this
component. In fact there are only 58, because many distinctions are partially collapsed. For3.2.1 Description - The numbers are singular, dual, and plural. The persons are first, second,
and third. The genders are masculine, neuter, and two feminine genders. The two feminine
genders make a number of distinctions including: age, size, formal vs familiar, human vs
animal, indefiniteness, and perhaps daintiness. For the most part one feminine gender, called
feminine-indefinite, is used for most human females and to mark an indefinite person while
the other, called feminine-zoic, is used for animals, and, since it mostly conflates with the
neuter gender, for objects. It is the feminine-zoic that in certain circumstances is used for
females who are large, either elderly or very young, or have a special relationship with the
speaker.
Transitivity is a problematic property in Oneida. Most analyses have identified three
sets of prefixes: a transitive set that marks properties of the agent and the patient, a set
called subjective that marks agents, and a set called objective that marks patients. The
problem is that the subjective and objective sets are in fact subsets of the transitive set. In
other words an intransitive verb with a first person agent is formally indistinguishable from
a transitive verb with a first person agent and a third person neuter patient. An intransitive
verb with a first person patient is formally indistinguishable from a transitive verb with ‘it’
as agent and ‘me’ as patient. However, there are many verb stems that occur only with the
subjective or objective (sub)set of pronominal prefixes instead of the full set of transitive
pronominal prefixes.
3.2.2 Constraints - There are a few co-occurrence restrictions between the pronominal prefixes
and the other components of an Oneida verb. In general the verb stem itself determines
whether subjective, objective, or transitive pronominal prefixes are used. Dative and causative
derivational suffixes are used to make intransitive verbs capable of taking transitive
pronominal prefixes. The stative suffix is incompatible with subjective pronominal prefixes,
so that a verb that may require subjective pronominals in all other aspects will occur with
objective pronominals when the stative suffix is used. Verbs with a full reflexive morpheme
are incompatible with transitive pronominal prefixes. Certain verbs only occur with dual or
plural pronominal prefixes (several of these have transitive English glosses such as -atla?
‘meet with’, -atalo- ‘be friends with’, and -ala%se- ‘be cousin to’).
3.2.3. The base forms of the 58 pronominal prefixes are given in the following charts. Since
the base forms are heavily dependent on the beginning phoneme of the verb stem, the charts
are organized by stem classes. In interpreting the charts, a general rule applies - whenever
the pronominal prefix ends in a vowel and the verb stem begins in a vowel, the vowel of
the verb stem is dropped. Rows distinguish agents and columns distinguish patients.",[12]
"8.2 Space - Oneida is rich in resources for expressing space. For location there are the8.4SemanticRoles- Semantic,or thematic,rolesare notexpressedbysyntaxnor,exceptfor possessives and locatives, in the noun morphology. Instead they are coded in the
pronominal prefixes (3.2.1) of the verb where a maximum of two roles can be distinguished.
The pronominal prefixes typically encode agent and/or patient, but, depending on the verb
stem, one or the other of these may be replaced by instrumental, beneficiary, possessive,
theme, or experiencer roles. Derivational suffixes (3.3.4) on verb stems create the potential
for many of these replacement roles, but there are some basic verb stems as well, such as
-atst- ‘use’ for expressing instruments and -ya- ‘lie’, ‘own’ for expressing possession. The
pronominal prefixes may coordinate semantically with nouns, if there are any, in the sentence,
but this coordination is not typically marked on the nouns. The particle 2e7n is often used
to indicate that a noun coordinates with the pronominal prefix in the verb, but the role is
not indicated.
The possessive is one semantic role for which there are additional resources beyond
the pronominal prefixes within verbs. Beyond several specific verb stems (such as -ya- ‘lie’,
‘own’ and -ka7%e- ‘have a lot of’) most of the adjectival verb stems (4.3.9) and several of
the positional verb stems (8.11) allow the pronomirial prefixes to express a patient role. There
is also a set of pronominal prefixes for nouns (4.2) and these express possessors. The stem
-awa- ‘belong to’ also takes the noun pronominal prefixes to express possessors. Possession
of inalienable nouns (many of the body parts) is expressed by the same pronominal prefixes
used to express agents in verbs.

suffixes. Verbs of motion include a group of verbs that are lexically motion verbs and these
typically end in /e/. There are also some derived motion verbs.
3.4.3.1 Suffix Forms - One way of deriving a motion verb is by suffixing the progressive
morpheme, which ends in /e/, onto a verb with the stative suffix. Another way of deriving
a motion verb is by adding the derivational suffix called the dislocative (-A-, -hn-, -As(1)-).
For such verbs there are five, rather than four, basic suffix options. The serial form adds
-hse? (-chse? for the verbs with the dislocative suffix); the punctual form adds -?- (-a2?- for
the dislocatives); the imperative form has zero marking; the stative form adds -nu- (-u- for
the dislocatives); and a fifth form is left bare (-e added to the dislocatives). For the
dislocative verbs this fifth form signifies current intention and for the other motion verbs it
signifies simple current action.
3.4.3.2 Meanings - The serial form for verbs of motion has its typical meaning of habitual
or current action but there is no implied direction. The punctual form does imply direction.
With the aorist prefix the typically meaning of past tense changes to direction away in
current time. Adding the cislocative as well changes the direction toward the focus, typically
the speaker. The future prefix also occurs with directional meaning but in future time. The4647imperative form has its typically command meaning. The stative suffix represents a resultant
state and is locational rather than directional (‘is gone’).

4.1 Noun types
Nouns in Oneida fall into four categories, based on their forms.
4.1.1
Single Morpheme - The first category consists of a small number of nouns that have
no internal structure. They are single morphemes. Many are animal names. 4:nuk ‘onion’,

‘T've gone to work (I'm away)’ stative
‘I went to work (and I'm now back)’ stative past
‘I'll be going to work’ stative punctual
‘I should have gone to work’ stative punctual4.1.2 Root Nouns - Many nouns fall into a second category that typically has three
components: a noun prefix (Xa-, o-, or zero); a noun root; and a noun suffix (usually -a? or
-e? but sometimes idiosyncratic forms). The prefix itself seems to add very little meaning
beyond simply identifying a noun. Most typically the meaning of the noun as a whole is the
same as the meaning of the noun root. There are a few exceptions where the noun has a
more specialized meaning than that of the noun root. The zero form of the prefix is common
with noun roots beginning with /a/, but the choice between ka and o- has little significance.
There is a tendency for nouns referring to manmade objects to take the ka- prefix while
those referring to natural object take the o-, but it is only a tendency. Similarly the suffix
seems to add little meaning beyond identifying the noun as a noun, and the choice among
the various forms is not semantically patterned. Some noun roots have a distinctive suffix
used when the root is incorporated into more complex constructions (see section 3.3.2) but
these suffixes are not used in the simple noun forms.

‘spoon’ from the noun root -atokwat- (distinctive suffix -sl-)A special subclass within this category of nouns contains the nouns referring to people. These
are different because they can take the pronominal prefixes usually found on verbs. Examplesare:

‘he's a person’ from ukwe ‘person’
‘he's a white man’ from o?slu'ni* ‘white person’
‘child’ or 'girl'laksa‘boy'48
4.1.3 Deverbal Nouns - A third category of nouns is formed by adding a nominalizer suffix
to verb stems. The forms of this suffix are: -(2)s+, which is generally used after consonants;
-(a)hsl-, which is generally used after vowels; -fs/, which is often used after a glottal stop;
-a(?)tsl-; and -ks/-, which is infrequent. A regular noun suffix, most commonly -2?, or less
commonly -i? or something else, is then added to complete the word. Examples are:

"TherearealsocommunitiesofOneidasonotherreservations and in several cities of the northeast. Of the many thousands of Oneida people
a very small percentage, perhaps not more than a few hundred, know the language and none
of them are monolingual in it. Those who know the language live mainly in two speech
communities in Wisconsin and Ontario. Most of these speakers are elderly. This state of
endangerment of the language is a concern for the Oneidas and there are language
preservation projects at all three reservations.
The language is spoken when speakers gather socially and as part of ceremonies of
the longhouse tradition. The language does not have a long tradition of literacy. In the
previous centuries occasional letters or Bibles (or in one case a diary) were written in an
orthography used by closely related Mohawk. Just prior to World War II, an academically
constructed, phoneme based orthography was introduced to the Oneidas of Wisconsin,
principally for a hymnal and a manuscript story collection. Beginning in the 1970's a
modification of this orthography was used by the language preservation projects. It is
currently used in language instruction and in academic research, but there are only a few
speakers who now use it regularly.
1.2 Prior Work - Many features of the grammar of Oneida are shared with the related
Iroquoian languages, especially Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora, so that
general descriptions of the Iroquoian family (Chafe 1976, Lounsbury 1978, Mithun 1979,
1999) are useful as are descriptions of the related languages themselves (see especially Chafe
1996). For specific features of Oneida, Lounsbury (1953) on the verb morphology is the
starting point. A number of texts have been published. Abbott (1982a, 1982b, 1983a, 1983b),
Abbott et al (1980), Boas (1909), Hinton (1996), and Lounsbury (1953) are drawn from the
Oneida community in Wisconsin while Michelson (1981) is from the community in Ontario.
One dictionary based on the Wisconsin community (Abbott et al 1996) is available while
Anton (1982) and Michelson (forthcoming) are based on the Ontario community. The current
grammatical description is based on the Wisconsin variety.
1.3 Noteworthy Features - The language has several noteworthy features. In the sound system
one of the prominent features is the small inventory of phonemes. The language has no
labials and voicing is not truly distinctive. There is a phonological process that affects many
words and is triggered by whether other words follow in a sentence. Among other things this
process typically involves whispering the final syllable.
The
morphology
is complex,

and

"There are four resonant consonants:
MV
alveolar lateral
/w/
high back glide
/y/ _ high front glide
/n/
alveolar nasal
The resonants are generally voiced but shade to voiceless beside laryngeals and word
final position.
There are two oral stops.
I/
an alveolar stop
/k/
a velar stop
The stops occur in both voiced and voiceless varieties. The voiced variety occurs
before any of the vowels or resonant consonants. The voiceless variety occurs elsewhere. This
analysis views the voicing of the stops as noncontrastive but other analyses have differed. In
such other analyses both a /t/ and a /d/ phoneme are posited to account for contrasts such
as between
do nik
‘how much’
to nik
‘that much’
This current analysis represents the same words as:
to nik
‘how much’
tho ni*k
‘that much’8The issue is whether the aspiration or the voicing is the more prominent feature of the
contrast. Partly this may be a matter of language background. Those with a background in
French tend to perceive the aspiration as more prominent while those with a background in
English tend to perceive the voicing as more prominent. Making the aspiration a separate
phoneme has the advantage of simplifying morphemic segmentation when, for example, a
morpheme ending in a stop is prefixed to a morpheme beginning with an /h/.
There is a single oral fricative:
/s/
alveolar fricative
The same discussion about voicing and aspiration with the stops also applies to the
fricative except that there is more variability among speakers. For most speakers an /s/
between two vowels is strongly voiced; an /s/ following or preceding /h/ is voiceless; and
elsewhere there is an intermediate amount of voicing. Before /y/ the alveolar fricative
becomes a palatal fricative.
There are two laryngeal phonemes.
/?/
glottal stop
/h/
glottal fricative
There is also a palatal affricate but it is understood as a cluster of phonemes:
/tsy/
(before vowels)
voiced palatal affricate
/tsi/
(before consonants) voiced palatal affricate
‘tshy/ (before vowels)
voiceless palatal affricate
/tshi/ (before consonants) voiceless palatal affricate
There are some restrictions on the clustering of Oneida phonemes. Sequences of two
vowels but not more than two vowels occur. Consonant clusters of up to five consonants are
found. The glottal stop occurs only after vowels, never after consonants. Geminate consonants
only occur with /t/ or /k/. /h/ occurs before or after consonants but not both at the same
time. Word initial clusters are more restricted than word medial clusters. No clusters with /h/
occur in word initial position except /sh/, /th/, and /kh/. There are no resonant initial clusters
in word initial position except /ny/. Clusters beginning with /k/, /t/, or /s/ may begin words
except for /tl/ and /tt/.
2.2 Accent Patterns - There are five accentual patterns for Oneida words. In these vowel
length is indicated by a raised dot after the vowel and the accented syllable is indicated by
an acute accent over the vowel in that accented syllable.
2.2.1 Straight accent. One vowel carries heightened loudness and pitch. This is
indicated with an acute accent over that vowel - /a/.
2.2.2 Long tone. One vowel is extra long. This is indicated with both a raised dot
for the length and an acute accent over the vowel - /a’/.
2.2.3 Accent shift. One vowel is lengthened and the following vowel has heightened
loudness and pitch. The lengthened vowel has a following raised dot and the next vowel has
the acute accent - /a'ta/.
2.2.4 Accent shift and long tone. One vowel is lengthened and the following vowel
is both lengthened and has heightened loudness and pitch. On both vowels the lengtheningis indicated by a following raised dot and there is an acute accent on the second of the9
vowels - /a‘ta’/.
2.2.5 Final length. The last oral vowel in the word is lengthened but without change
in pitch. This is indicated by a raised dot after the lengthened vowel - /a/. In this case there
is typically an additional final syllable that has been either dropped of whispered due to a
phonological process described later.
These five accent patterns are the generally predictable results of several phonological
processes (see section 2.3.2).
2.3.1 Epenthesis - It is not uncommon in constructing Oneida words for combinations of
morphemes to create clusters of consonants (the end of one morpheme joined to the
beginning of another) that violate the phonotactics of the language. In such cases an
epenthetic vowel is inserted. The epenthetic vowel is typically /e/ and there are four
morpheme boundaries in which it may occur:
between a verb stem and an aspectual morpheme (or between a noun root and a
nominal suffix) that is a glottal stop;
between a reflexive morpheme and a verb stem;
between a pronominal prefix and a verb stem (or between a possessive prefix and a
noun stem); and
between a pre-pronominal prefix and a pronominal prefix.
There are two additional epenthetic processes. In the derivation of verb stems the
separation of an incorporated noun and a verb is often marked by the vowel /a/ that belongs
to neither morpheme. It is called a stem joiner. In short words that do not have enough
syllables for the accent placement rule to work, an additional syllable is created at the front
of the word with a prothetic /i/. Finally there is an epenthesis that is part of the whispering
process described in section 2.3.3.
2.3.2 Accent Morphophonemics - Accent placement as a phonological process applies to
words after the morphemes have been selected, arranged, and any needed epenthesis has
applied. The general rule is to count back two syllable (two vowels) from the end of the
word and in so doing skip any stem joiners or epenthetic vowels before the aspect suffix (or
the nominal suffix for a noun). The accent remains there unless one of three special
environments obtains.
If the accented vowel immediately precedes a glottal stop, then the glottal stop is
deleted and the vowel is lengthened.
If the accented vowel immediate precedes an /h/ followed by a resonant consonant (/I/,
/wi, /y/, or /n/), then the /h/ is deleted and the vowel is lengthened.
If the accented vowel immediate precedes a single consonant (not a cluster) other than
/h/, then the vowel is lengthened and the accent shifts to the following vowel.
2.3.3 Whispering - Many Oneida words have two different pronunciations depending on
where they occur in a sentence. Sentence final forms (or words spoken in isolation or as
citation forms) often undergo a process that includes the whispering, indicated here by
underlining, of the final syllable. Words spoken with other words immediately after them do
not undergo this process. The exact process depends on the phonological shape of the word.","[5, 6]"

but many verbs require the dualic prefix no matter what the pronominal prefixes may be.
Many of these are actions involving either the arms or legs, which naturally come in sets of
two (run, jump, travel, swing, wave, pinch), but many others seem to have little to do with
the idea of two (yell, comb hair, smash, clean up, sweat). In these cases the dualic prefix
seems to add no special meaning and can be considered part of the lexical item with the
verb stem. The dualic also assumes the function of the iterative prefix when one wants to
express the meanings of both the iterative and the cislocative prefixes (toward again, or back
toward). In form the cislocative and iterative are mutually exclusive.
3.1.4.7 The iterative prefix -s-, like the English prefix re-, signals repetition or returning.

are added to the kind of nouns built from noun roots. Among them are the following.
4.3.1
Locative suffixes: -ke/ -hne The -ke variant is found after a glottal stop which means
it is the typical choice after a regular noun suffix -a? and the -Aze is found elsewhere.
ka?slehta-ke
‘on the car’ from -?sleht- 'vehicle'
onuta'ke
‘on the hill’ from -nut- ‘hill’
kanata‘ke
‘in town’ from -nat- 'settlement'
ukwehuwé-ne
‘in Oneida’ from -ukwehuwe- Oneida, real person
kolahkowanhne
‘Canada’ from kolahkowan Indian agent
koskésne
‘in a pigpen’ from koskos 'pig'
This is sometimes called the external locative and means ‘on’. It is nearly obligatory with
nouns for body parts,
kenyala-ke
‘my neck’ from -nyalsnatsha-ke
‘your arm’ from -natshyenutsi-ne
‘her head’ from -nutsi(st)The suffix -aku is sometimes called the internal locative. It attaches directly to the noun root
and replaces the regular noun suffix. It means in as in the following:
‘in the car’ from -?slehtka?sléhtaku
‘in the woods’ from -lhkélhaku
‘in the bucket’ from -na?tsykana‘tsyaku
The suffix -oku also attaches directly to a noun root and it means under.
ka?slehto""ki
‘under the car’ from -?sleht-kanuhso-ki
kaluto""ka50
‘under the house’ from -nuhs‘under the log’ from -lut-The suffix -akta attaches directly to a noun root and means ‘near' or 'close'. It has extended
forms -aktuti/ -aktati which mean along side of.
ka?slehtakta
‘near the car’ from -?slehtkanuhsakta
‘near the house’ from -nuhskawhyuhaktiti
‘along the river’ from -whyuh4.3.2 Plural suffixes: -shuha This form attaches to a noun after the regular noun suffix. It
pluralizes the noun whether a pronominal prefix does or not.
ahta?shuha
‘shoes’ from -ahtalatiksa?shtha
‘children’ from -ksa?onu?uhsla?shiha
‘squashes’
from -nu?uhslThe suffix -shu is a variant that attaches to forms other than the regular noun suffix.
swala?séshu
‘your cousins’ from -ala?selatiyanéshu
‘chiefs’ from -yan(es)It attaches to locatives to mean -késhu ‘along’ or -akushu ‘through’.
kalhakushu
‘through the woods’ from -lhohaha?késhu
‘along the road’ from -hahkahatakashu
‘through the field’ from -hatIt attaches to counting words to mean each or a piece,skahwistatsu‘one dollar each’ from -hwist-oyelishu‘ten a piece’Another pluralizer suffix -hokw/-hokiha/-o'ki is used with particular noun roots.

lotihsotho""ki‘medicines’ from -nuhkwa7t‘elders’ from -hsot-The suffix -%se is a plural used primarily with stative verbs but also with some single nouns.
‘good cars’ from -?sleht- and -iyoka?slehtiyé:se
‘I have some good corn’ from -nast- and -iyowaknastiyo'se
latikwa'ni'se
‘leaders’ from -kwana-It combines with the verb root to be small (which always requires the particle ka? and the
partitive prefix) as -2%sa to mean many small items.

‘small fish’ from -itsyka? niyohaha:sa
‘small paths’ from -hahka? nikaksa’sa

ukwehuwehnéha
‘ways of the real people’ -ukwehuwe-, ‘Oneida language’
kwaahsute?kékha
‘ways of the night’ -ahsut-4.3.5 Augment suffix: -ké The general meaning of this suffix is ‘large’, but it almost always
involves some semantic specialization. It attaches to noun roots:
anuk
‘onion’
a?nukk6é
‘leeks’
oli‘té
‘dove’
olite?kd
‘pigeon’
It also attaches to locatives,
kalhaku
‘in the-woods’ kalhakuhké ‘deep in the woods’
or to time expressions.
kwaahsuté'ke ‘at night’?
kwa?ahsute?kehko ‘late at night’The same suffix can be used on verbs in the serial aspect that are used as nouns.lato‘lats ‘he hunts’, ‘hunter’ latolatské ‘mighty hunter’
4.3.6 Decessive suffix: -k4 With personal names, kinship terms, and other words for people
this suffix means that the individual has passed on. With objects it means either former
possession or that the object is no longer usable.
yukwahsothoku?ké
‘our ancestors’
yukwahsotho:ki
‘our elders'
ake?slehtké
‘my former car’
aké-sleht
‘my car'
yukwanuhsa?ki
‘our former house’
yukwanthsa?
‘our house!
4.3.7 Characterizer suffix: -4a? This suffix attaches to locative suffixes, noun roots after the
regular noun suffix, and serial verbs used as nouns. After the noun suffix -a? the
characterizer suffix is lost entirely and it existence is only known through the accent shift.
The meaning is usually a semantic specialization.","[26, 27]"
"In addition there are interrogative, indefinite, demonstrative, and emphatic self pronouns, but
many of these by both their form and function might better be called particles.
uhka? nahte?
‘who'
uhka? ok
‘someone!
ka?i-ki

thi‘ké
‘that’
akaulha

6. Particles
6.1
Definitions - Particles might be defined as all those words in the language that do not
have any internal complexity (single morphemes), or they might be defined in functional
terms as all those words that function as neither nouns nor verbs. In practical terms both
definitions are too restrictive. A wider sense of the term would include several kinds of
expressions. All the single morpheme words not used as nouns are particles:
tho ‘there’, ‘then’; tsi? ‘as’, ‘that’; she-ki ‘still’; ostuha ‘little bit’
Particles also include some frozen verb forms that have developed special senses. The verb
forms in these are either partially decayed or quite transparent:
niyo'lé ‘a distance’; ni-y6t ‘how it appears’; aydlhane? ‘tomorrow’; swatye'lA
‘sometimes’; tyétkut ‘always’56
Some combinations of particles have melded and have an idiomatic meaning:
nok ‘only’ from ne ok; okhale? ‘and’ from ok ale?; okhna? ‘and then’ from ok na?","[29, 30]"
"8.5 Gender - Gender is distinguished not by lexical items but by pronominal prefixes (3.2.1).
So the word for woman is not expressed by a stem for woman but by a stem for person
with a feminine pronominal prefix. Since the pronominal prefixes encode number, transitivity,
and person along with gender, the four genders (masculine, neuter, and two feminines) are
not distinguished in every case - only in the third person. The possessive prefixes that occur
with nouns also distinguish genders.",[32]

This work is based on access to text collections and twenty five years of fieldwork
among the Oneidas of Wisconsin. The main text collection was gathered in the late 1930’s
by Oneida speakers as part of a project led by Floyd Lounsbury and funded through the
Works Progress Administration of the US federal government. Those speakers included:
Andrew Becchtree, Dennison Hill, LaFront King, Guy Elm, Ida Blackhawk, John A.
Skenandore, Lewis Webster, Oscar Archiquette, Stadler King, Tillie Baird, David Skenandore,
Walter Skenandore, and Alex Metoxen.
The fieldwork was done in the same community in cooperation with a series of
language preservation projects of the Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin. The Oneida speakers in this
work included: Dorothy Tallakson, Melinda Doxtator, Lawrence John, Melissa Cornelius,
Amos Christjohn, Maria Hinton, Mary Jourdan, Flora Skenandore, Mary Danforth, Loretta
Webster, Rebecca Ninham, Lloyd Schuyler, Mamie Ryan, Priscilla Manders, Bob Brown, Ruth

-ani-/-A- and in each case the first alternate in the set occurs with serial and stative aspect
suffixes (the fourth component of an Oneida verb) and the second occurs with the punctual
aspect suffix. The choice among the sets is controlled by the verb, although some verbs occur
with more than one choice without contrasting meaning. The function of the dative is to
allow a pronominal prefix to refer to a patient (for an otherwise intransitive verb) or a
beneficiary (where the patient is an incorporated noun).

the stative suffix) as nouns for specific tools or locations.‘swimming place’teyutkanye?takhwa?

"Affricate — If the basic form of a prepronominal component ends in /s/ and the
following pronominal component begins with /y/, then the /sy/ combination becomes /tsy/.
Second Person — When certain second person pronominal prefixes are used, they
condition the following changes in the prepronominal prefixes: those that end in /a/ change
the /a/ to /e/; those that end in /t/ change that /t/ to /ti/; and those that end in /s/ change the
/s/ to /tsi/. There is some variation among speakers as to exactly which second person
pronominal prefixes condition these changes, but the best generalization seems to be all the
intransitive prefixes except the subjective singular.
:
Portmanteau — When the boundary between the prepronominal and pronominal prefixes
contains the sequence /awa/ or /a?wa/ or /wa?wa/, then that entire sequence is replaced byfal,
Accent — The normal rules of accent placement and laryngeal loss and prothesis will
modify the prepronominal prefixes just as they would any other parts of an Oneida word.
There is one additional change that occurs when the accent falls on the translocative prefix-ye- (or its combination with future -ya- or aorist -ya- or with other prefixes positioned in
front of the translocative). In such cases the accented vowel doubles creating -yehé- (or
-yAhAé- with the future or -yahd- with the aorist).",[9]

"61607.6 Adverbial Clauses - Adverbial clauses are introduced hypotactically or by characteristic
particles, particle clusters, special verbs, or in a few cases simply with prepronominal
prefixes. Clauses of time are often introduced by particle clusters such as Kanyd ond ‘when!
or tsi? niyo'lé ‘until’. Correlative clauses introduced by ond - ond are often interpreted as
‘when' - 'then'. The coincident prefix can also be interpreted as a subordinating ‘when’.
Clauses of place are typically introduced with the particle cluster ts/? nu or by the use of
the cislocative or translocative prefixes. Clauses of manner are often introduced by the
particle cluster fs/? ni-yot tsi? the way that'. Clauses of cause are typically introduced by ze
tsi? because’ or ne aoli-wa? tsi? ‘the reason that’. Conditional clauses are introduced by kanyd
‘when' or ‘if or by f2’t ntiwa? ‘if. Comparison clauses most often contain the particle séha?
‘more’. Degree clauses usually contain sd‘ts/? too much’. Result clauses are often introduced
by a form of the verb -kweni- 'be able’ such as akakwe-ni: ‘it can be' or 'so that’.","[31, 32]"
"Fromasmallsetof nounderivational possibilities, including noun incorporation,andverbrootstherethat create a large numberaremanyof stemson which, particularly for verbs, numerous inflectional prefixes and suffixes can be added.
Thus, verbs in Oneida frequently correspond to whole clauses in other languages.
There are three parts of speech - nouns, verbs, and particles - and the verbs clearly
dominate the language. Syntax is problematic for several reasons: because word order is fairly
free and seems to follow informational demands more than syntactic ones, because there are
many paratactic constructions, and because the concept of a sentence is somewhat
indeterminate (run on sentences are common in both oratory and conversation).
Among the semantic distinctions the existence of two feminine genders, the resources
and demands for spatial orientation, and the hierarchical structure of the nouns are dominant
features.
2. Phonology
2.1Phoneme Inventory - There are six vowel phonemes. Four are oral vowels:
if
a high front unrounded vowel
/e/
a mid front unrounded vowel
Jal
a low central unrounded vowel
/o/
a high back weakly rounded vowel
There are two nasal vowels:
/a/
a mid central to back unrounded vowel
fa/
a high back weakly rounded vowel
Each of the vowels may occur in any of five varieties: short, lengthened, accented,
simultaneously lengthened and accented, and whispered.",[5]
"433.4.1.2 Suffix Forms - The forms of the four suffixes depend on the verb stem. Possible
serial endings are: -he?, -ha?, -s, -as, -hse?, and -?’se?. Forms of the punctual are: -2 -s?
and -ae?. Forms of the imperative are zero, except for stems ending in a glottal stop which
add -2-. Forms for the stative are: -?, -u, -s, -7u, -au, and zero. There are patterns among
these choices. Lounsbury (1953) set up 14 categories of verb stems to be able to predict the
aspect choices on the basis of the ending sounds of the verb stem, but there are exceptions
and some variation among speakers.
3.4.1.3 Tenses - The serial, punctual, and stative suffixes can all inflect for past and future
tense. The past tenses are: -kwe? for the serial suffix (exceptionally the -4e? serial suffix
becomes -4ahkwe? with this attachment) and -Ane for the stative suffix. The serial past
creates a meaning of a habitual past action (‘was doing’, or ‘used to do’) and the stative past
creates a meaning of a past state (‘was doing’ or ‘had done’). With the punctual suffix, past
is represented with the aorist prepronominal prefix. The meaning is simple past (‘did’) and
with dynamic verbs this can be considered a perfective aspect in the sense that the action
is not viewed as having any internal temporal structure.
For the future tenses the future prepronominal prefix is used. With the punctual suffix
the meaning is a predication (‘will do’). A morpheme, sometimes called the continuative
(Lounsbury, 1953) or the modalizer, -ke? is attached to the serial suffix, creating a future
continuative meaning (‘will be doing’) and -Aake? is attached to the stative suffix, creating
a future continuative state meaning (‘will be done’, or ‘will have been doing’). In all of
these cases the future prefix can be replaced by the indefinite prefix to create a mildly
obligatory meaning (‘should do’, ‘should be doing’, ‘should be done’).
3.4.1.4 Progressive - The stative suffix also inflects for a progressive suffix that represents
ongoing action and usually motion (‘go along doing’). As motion verbs, verbs with the
progressive suffix can reinflect for another set of suffixes [see section 3.4.3.1]. The
progressive suffix can also attach to some locational verbs where the meaning is not motionas much as extension along some space. The forms of this suffix are -tye, -atye, or -hatye
depending on the verb stem.

there are other patterns as well. Many verbs expressing a descriptive, perceptual, or
experiential meaning can be considered stative. The basic form of these verbs has no obvious
suffix. It would be easy to identify these forms as stative suffixes since a zero suffix is one
of the allomorphs of the stative suffix except that some of these verbs occur with subjective
pronominal prefixes, something that elsewhere is incompatible with the stative suffix. These
basically stative verbs do not occur with a serial suffix. They can, however, be inflected for
tense. For the past tense some take the suffix normally found with serial suffixes, -kwe, and
some take the suffix normally found with stative suffixes, -Aze. To express a future meaning
a punctual suffix is needed since the future prepronominal prefix is only compatible with a
punctual suffix. Stative verbs have several ways of creating such punctual forms. Some
essentially derive action verbs by adding an inchoative or causative suffix to the verb stem
and then inflecting that verb with any of the four regular aspect suffixes of dynamic verbs.","[23, 24]"
"Morphemeanalysisis given byseparatingthemorphemes by hyphens and regularlizing their phonemic form. A second line of analysis
provides for each of the separated morphemes an identification with either one of the above
abbreviations or by an English gloss. Hyphens are used with the glosses to indicate whereseveral English words correspond to a single Oneida morpheme.",[4]
"63
Parataxis is the norm. There are, however, some other resources. Purpose can be expressed
by the dislocative suffix (3.3.4.6). Result can be expressed with forms of the verb -kweni‘to be able’ or the particle “ka ‘lest’, ‘so as not’ for negative clauses. Condition can be
expressed by particles such as kanyo ond ‘if’, ‘when’, or fat ‘if’, ‘perhaps’.
Complementation can be expressed by the indefinite tense (3.1.4.3) or future tense
(3.1.4.1) prefixes, or by particles. Verbs or clauses that function to fill argument roles to
other verbs are often introduced by subordinating particles ts/? or ae or relative clause
particles clusters tsi? ka:yA- ‘the one(s) that’ and tsi? ndéhte? ‘what’.
8.10 Interrogatives - For yes-no questions the main resource is the postpositive particle ka,
always the second word in the sentence. A questioning intonation pattern is also used for
short sentences. For wh-questions there is a set of interrogative particles (6.2.1). Syntactic
variation is not a resource for interrogatives.
8.11 Taxonomy and classification - There is a good deal of structure to the lexical relations
in Oneida, particularly among the nouns. A set of positional verbs classifies nouns according
to their most natural orientation e.g. -of ‘standing’, -ya- ‘lying’, -ut- ‘protruding’, or -ihal‘hanging’. Noun incorporation, particularly with the verb root -o%ta- ‘kind of’, expresses
many instances of hyponomy.

‘he won’SERbe able PNC3.3.2 Noun Incorporation - The second component is for noun incorporation. In this slot may
occur noun roots (single noun morphemes), nominalized verb stems (verb stems with a
nominalization suffix), or empty roots (semantically empty morphemes required by certain
verbs when no specific noun is incorporated).
Noun roots are single noun morphemes. Some common examples are -aast ‘corn’;
-wik ‘offspring’; -/ut ‘log’; -auhs- ‘building’; and -khw- ‘food’. Many noun roots have an
incorporated form that differs from their unincorporated form. Typically, the incorporated
form has a suffixed consonant or consonant cluster that adds no meaning. Which noun roots
require this addition is not predictable on either semantic or phonological conditions. For
some nouns the suffixation has the form of the instrumental suffix (-7t-, -t-, -ht-, -Akw-) as34
in -ukwe%- ‘person’; -/yo7t- ‘animal’; -shest ‘syrup’; and -ahtahkw- ‘shoe’. For others it is
very much like the suffix used to nominalize verbs (-s/-, -ts/-, -As/-) as in -atokwatsl‘spoon’; -nuhkwas/- ‘medicine’; -ts/%ats- ‘bird’; and -ahtahnawats/+ ‘ball’. The choices
among these alternates are not governed by strict rules but there are some generalizations:
-%- tends to occur after vowels, particularly /e/; -7 tends to occur after /s/; -s/ tends to
occur after /t/ and /k/; and -As/- tends to occur after /a/.
Nominalized verb stems can also be incorporated as nouns. Verbs are nominalized by
the suffixation of a nominalizer morpheme which has many forms: -s/-, -as/-, -hs/-, -ahsl-,
-tsl-, -atsl-, -7tsl-, -a7tsl-, -ksl-, -aksl-, -a%ksl-, -?sl-, and -%-. The choice among these forms
is dependent on the verb being nominalized but is not strictly predictable (the best
generalizations are that -As/ occurs after vowels and forms with /t/ tend to occur after glottal
stops). Some examples are:
-atliyohsl‘fighting’ from —atliyo- ‘fight’
-atalo?sl‘friend’ from —atalo- ‘be friends’
-yo?tahsl‘job’ from —yo?te- ‘work’
-hyatuhsl‘paper’, ‘book’ from —hyatu- ‘write’
There is also variation among speakers.
The third possibility for the noun incorporation slot is an empty morpheme, usually
a syllable or less. Some verbs require that the noun incorporation slot be filled and when a
more specific noun root or nominalized verb is not used, an empty morpheme fills the slot.
The choice among many alternatives depends on the incorporating verb stem. Some examples
are: -?sk- in -?sko- ‘put in water’; -%sk- in -?skut ‘fry’; -7/4 in -7holok- ‘cover’; -7/- in
-Ahenya?- ‘collapse’; -2- in -nzohale- ‘wash’; and -Any- in -Anyof- ‘set up’.
The meaning shift that the noun incorporation adds to the verb often is to specify a
type of patient role but it is not always a predictable shift and is probably best viewed as
a process of lexical derivation. The presence or absence of an incorporated noun is controlled
by the verb (the third component of the verb stem) where some verbs require noun
incorporation, some verbs never allow it, and some provide a choice of incorporation or not.","[18, 19]"

3.3 Verb Stem - The third component of the Oneida verb contains the verb stem. Verb stems
may be single morphemes (verb roots) or more complex derived forms built on a verb root
sometimes through many layers of derivation. A verb stem can be analyzed as containing
four components where the third component is required and the others are available for
derivational options.
Verb Stem Components
ReflexiveIncorporatedVerbDerivationalNounRootSuffix3.3.1 Reflexive - The first component, reflexive, may contain either a semi-reflexive or a full
reflexive. The basic form of the semi-reflexive is -at+ although there are less common forms:
-ata- is used before some forms beginning with /n/ or /?/; -ate- is used elsewhere when
epenthesis is needed to avoid an impossible consonant cluster; -an- is used before many forms
beginning with /i/; and -a/ is used before a very few forms beginning with /a/. The meaning
of the semi-reflexive depends on the verb (the third component of the verb stem). For someverbs the semi-reflexive creates an unpredictable semantic specialization or shift.

"8.6 Aspect - The resources for expressing aspect are either the inherent aspect of particular
verb stems or the aspectual suffixes (3.4) that are obligatory on verbs, A variety of particles
and a few other parts of the verbal morphology supplement these resources. Perfective aspect
in the sense of no internal temporal texture is expressed through the punctual suffix.
Imperfective aspect is expressed in a number of ways. A progressive or on going action can
be expressed, depending on the verb stem by: the serial suffix, the stative suffix, or the
progressive suffix. A habitual, that is a repeated or customary, action is expressed by the
serial suffix. An inchoative (becoming) aspect is marked by a derivational inchoative suffix62(3.3.4.2). An iterative (repetitive) aspect may be marked by the serial suffix or by a
distributive suffix (3.3.4.1) or by certain particles, but not by the iterative prefix, which
marks only a single repetition, not a series. There is no affix that specifically indicates
inceptive (beginning) aspect, but a particular verb stem -afahsawa- 'begin' is used instead.
The kinds of meanings expressed by the English perfect tense, which may be
aspectual, such as resultative (‘is done’), recent past (‘has just done’), persistent (‘has done
for a long time’) are generally expressed in Oneida by the stative suffix. The experiential
perfect (‘have you ever’) may be expressed in Oneida by either the stative or the punctual
suffixes.
There are several resources for expressing a prospective (‘to be about to do’) aspect.
An impersonal use of the verb -elhe- ‘want’, the dislocative suffix (3.3.4.6), and a
combination of cislocative prefix and punctual suffix on a verb of motion are all ways to
expressing impending action.

8.7 Modality - Epistemic and deontic modalities are variously marked by syntactic
constructions, particles, specific lexical items, and prefixes on verbs. Necessity can be
expressed by nok awa‘ti ‘it can only be’ or by yah thdu ts{?. Possibility can be expressed
by awa‘ti ‘it will become’, forms of -kwenr ‘be able’ such as akakwe‘ni: ‘it can be’, or
particle combinations such as /a‘t miwa? ‘perhaps’. Obligation can be expressed by the verb
-atuhutsyoh- ‘supposed to’, or more mildly, by the indefinite tense prefix ahato‘léte? ‘he
should hunt’. Desire is typically expressed with the verb -el/he- ‘want’. Epistemic meanings
are expressed by the three tense prefixes - aorist for the most definite, future for sure
predictions, and indefinite for the least sure - and by particles (6.2.9).
8.8 Negation - Negation is expressed by a small number of particles (6.2.5) and by two
complementary prefixes on the verb, the contrastive (3.1.4.10) and the negative (3.1.4.11).
8.9 Clausal Relations - In multi-verb sentences the potential semantic relationships among the
verbs (e.g. purpose, result, condition, complementation) is often not expressed explicitly.","[32, 33]"
"4.1.4 Syntactic Nouns - A fourth and very large category of nouns is formed by
constructing a verb, typically with an indefinite pronominal prefix and serial suffix, and then
simply using that verb syntactically as a noun. Action verbs can be turned into actors or
objects by this process.

"8.3 Number - Distinctions of number, singular, dual, and plural, are expressed by: noun
suffixes, counting verbs -at and -ake, the iterative (3.1.4.7), dualic (3.1.4.6), and partitive
(3.1.4.8) prefixes, many of the pronominal prefixes (3.2.1), the distributive suffix (3.3.4.1),
number pronouns made from verb forms without a verb stem (aihéti, noi:ku, nikiti), the
stative plural -’se? (4.3.2), quantifier particles such as akweku ‘all’ and ‘dhka 'several', and
a variety of other particles. Within the verb morphology there are also resources to express
several kinds of iteration: the serial suffix (3.4.1.1), the iterative prefix (3.1.4.7), the
distributive suffix (3.3.4.1), and the progressive suffix (3.4.1.4).",[32]
"6.2.7Other combinations of particles may not have melded but have developed semantic
specializations:
onk kwi ‘now then’; kwah i-kA ‘very’; nok tsi? ‘but’; ok ne?n ‘or’; ki? wah ‘indeed’6.2.8Still other combinations can contain quite a few particles. These are often used to introduce
sentences or clauses:
onk ki? ale? wi ‘immediately’; kwah kas kati? wi ‘usually’; tho né ond ‘and then’
Several particles are exceptions to the accent placement and accent shift rules of the
phonology and longer combinations of particles have their own idiosyncratic accent patterns.
6.2 Functions - Functionally particles, in the widest sense, can be grouped as interrogative,
time, place, emphasis, negation, degree, conjunctions, subordinators, and evidentials. Some
selected examples are:
6.2.1Interrogative particles:

‘something used for washing dishes’PNC3.3.5.6 Finally it is useful to classify verbs by their aspectual requirements. Here there are
three major classes - dynamic, stative, and motion verbs - with several subclasses. A large
number of stems that are actions or processes fall into the dynamic class. They occur with
four basic aspectual suffixes (described in the section 3.4.1) and extensions of them. Stative
verbs, in contrast, do not occur with the range of aspectual suffixes that the dynamic stems
do. Stative verbs fall into a couple of subclasses depending on which of the aspectual
suffixes they do occur with. There are, however, several derivational suffixes that can convert
Stative stems into dynamic ones, such as an inchoative and the causative morpheme(s). The
third class, the motion verbs, resembles the dynamic class in that motion verbs occur with
the same aspectual suffixes but several of them have quite different functions. There is also
one additional form that motion verbs have that the dynamic verbs do not. There are three
important subclasses of motion verbs: those stems that are inherently motion verbs; those that
have been derived from other verbs by adding what has been called a purposive or
dislocative (‘going to’) morpheme; and those that have been derived from other verbs by
adding a progressive (‘going along’) morpheme.‘soap’-(n)ohalenyu-n-ohale-nyu

Suffixes3.4 Aspect Suffixes - The final component of an Oneida verb is for a set of suffixes that
are in part aspectual. As in many languages aspectual distinctions are sometimes inherent in
lexical items or stems, are sometimes represented in affixes, and are frequently combined with
notions of tense and modality. This is true of Oneida and it presents a terminological
problem. Lounsbury (1953) used a set of labels still used by some for the basic suffixes and
their extensions. These labels reflected his analysis of their functions. Later researchers of
Oneida and related Iroquoian languages discovered more variation in the functions of these
suffixes and with developments in theories of aspect have proposed several alternative labels
for the same suffixes. Depending on what they are attached to, most of these suffixes have
multiple functions and a linguist's labels might reflect a function considered more basic, more
frequent, or a historical source. Whatever labels are used, it is important here to distinguish
forms and functions.",[22]

verbs. Its forms are -hsy- or -hkw- or -kw-. The choice among the three forms is dependent
on the verb it is suffixed to. -Hsy- is also a regular verb root used when nouns for articles
of clothing are incorporated with it. -Kw tends to be used with positional verbs to mean to
get out of a particular position.

from -khwahl‘put food out’
3.3.4.6 Dislocative — The forms of this morpheme are: -2, which tends to be used after the
single consonants /t/ or /k/; -%n-/-hn-/-hsl-, which tend to be used after vowels, the choice
depending on the verb; and -a%n-/-ahn-, which tend to be used after other consonants or
clusters. A few verbs are known to occur with more than one of these alternatives. The /l/
in -As/ typically occurs only with the serial suffixes. The meaning of the dislocative adds
motion (going to) to the action of the verb.

possible for combinations to occur. When combinations occur the undoer, inchoative, and
causative uses of the instrumental occur immediately after a verb root and the dislocative
must occur immediately before the aspect component, but the others are free to occur in
many atrangements. These arrangements may be best understood as nested constituents so that
a verb root and a single derivational suffix form a complex verb that then adds another
single derivational suffix to form a new complex verb that then adds another suffix and soon.
3.3.5 Verb Classes - There are many ways to classify the many
the following six ways may be the most important.verb stems of Oneida but3.3.5.1 Verb stems may be classified by their beginning phoneme. The beginning phoneme
determines many of the alternations in the forms of the pronominal prefixes. The largest class
consists of the verb stems beginning with /a/, called a-stems, followed by i-stems, o- and ustems (o- and u-stems pattern with the same alternations), and e- and s-stems (e- and a-stems
pattern with the same alternations). Stems beginning with consonants, called c-stems, form
another large category. For some alternations there is the occasional need to refer specifically
to y-stems or h-stems, but for the most part c-stems operate the same.
3.3.5.2 Stems can also be classified by limitations they place on the pronominal prefixes that
are possible. Most dynamic verb stems require subjective prefixes (except when the stative
suffix is added), while others require objective prefixes (e.g. -ke?toht- ‘appear,’ -yote- ‘work,'
-nuhwakta(ni)- ""be sick,' -nuhyanik- ‘be stingy'), while still others allow (or require) transitive
prefixes. In addition there are stems that take impersonal prefixes (e.g. intransitives such as
-liha- ‘boil' or -Ali- ""break') and stems that take only nonsingular prefixes (e.g. -atalo- ‘be
friends’, -a?wata?- ‘die off, -a/a?se- ""be cousins’).
3.3.5.3 Verb stems can also be classified by whether they treat some of the prepronominal
prefixes as inflectional options or as lexical requirements. The most inflectional of the
prepronominal prefixes (future, aorist, indefinite, negative) are not used as lexical
requirements, but the others are, with stems requiring the dualic being most common,
followed by the cislocative, iterative, partitive, translocative, coincident, contrastive. For a few
verb stems a combination of prefixes is required.39

"8. Functionalist View - The following is a brief look at some highlights of Oneida grammar
from a functionalist perspective. The idea is to demonstrate the range of linguistic resources
the language has for certain standard functions.
8.1 Time - Resources for expressing past time include: the aorist prefix except with motion
verbs (3.1.4.2), two past suffixes - serial past and stative past (3.4.1.3), the stative suffix
when used to express resultant states, the verb root -unis- for passage of time, the decessive
suffix (4.3.6) on nouns, and a variety of temporal particles (6.2.2).
Resources for expressing present time include: serial suffix of some verbs, stative
suffix for some verbs (3.4.1.1), progressive suffix (3.4.1.4), aorist prefix with motion verbs
(3.4.3.2), and several particles (6.2.2).
Resources for expressing future time include: future prefix (3.1.4.1), cislocative prefix
with a progressive suffix (3.1.4.5), and the dislocative suffix with the aorist, serial, or future
morphemes (3.3.4.6).",[32]

maycontain oneor moreof several353.3.4.1 Distributive — The possible forms are -As/u-, -Au-, -nyu-, and -w. The meaning
distributes the action of the verb in time (several times) or place (here and there) or it
pluralizes the patient, especially an incorporated noun. Compare the following:
-atahahokahslu‘branching roads’
-atahahoka‘fork in the road’
-atketskwanyu‘get up often’
-atketskw“get up’
-kalatunyu‘tell stories’
-kalatu‘tell a story’
-nohalenyu‘wash many objects’ -nohale‘wash’
-ksahlunyu‘set dishes out’
-ksahl‘set out a dish’
-nuhsotu‘houses standing’
-nuhsot‘house standing’
-ya?khu‘cut up’
-ya?k‘cut’
3.3.4.2 Inchoative — The basic form is -* after vowels and -a? after consonants. It is added
to verb forms that are inherently stative, especially positional verbs, to form non-stative verbs.
-ata?‘get in’
-at‘be in’
-yata?“get?
-ya(t)‘set’, ‘place’, ‘have’
-ksta?“become old’
-ksta‘be old’-nakla?-“become plentiful’-nakle-‘be plentiful’-ta?-‘stand up’, ‘stop’-t-“be standing’3.3.4.3 Instrumental — This derivational suffix is made up of several alternative forms and
several meanings that overlap sufficiently to frustrate attempts to identify separate morphemes.
The basic forms of the instrumental are -At-, -7t-, -st-, -t-, and -hkw-. The choice among
them is dependent on the verb. For some few verbs more than one alternative is possible and
there is some variation among speakers. Granting many exceptions, there are the following
generalizations: -+ tends to occur after /k/; all the others occur after vowels; -st also occurs
after /t/; after consonants all of the basic forms occur with an inserted vowel (usually /a/);
some verbs ending in /s/ have the /a/ replaced by /a/ before one of the basic forms. The
meaning of the instrumental suffix is to add an instrumental role to the verb but both stems
and individual words often undergo some semantic specialization.

it difficult to distinguish separate sentences. There is not a strong intuition for the notion
of a sentence boundary felt with much agreement among native speakers. Chafe (1994) has
argued for the related language Seneca that intonation units, each contributing a single new
piece of information, are much more important building blocks than the sentence. The word
order constraints that one typically associates with the syntax of sentences are strongest within
these intonation units. An intonation unit is typically built around a noun or a verb. Those
built around nouns can put the noun at the beginning

Intonation units built around verbs may put the verb in the first position, but more typically
put it after some orienting particles. If the reference of a pronominal prefix is not clear from

3.4.1 Dynamicverbs3.4.1.1 A large class of verb stems that are inherently dynamic rather than stative inflect for
four suffixes: serial (also called iterative, habitual, or imperfective), punctual (also called
perfective), imperative, and stative (also called perfective or descriptive). The serial suffix
represents seriated action, either a characteristic action done a series of times (hence the name
habitual) or an ongoing current action. These functions are primarily imperfective in aspect.
The punctual suffix occurs only with one of three prepronominal prefixes (future,
aorist, indefinite) and typically represents a noncontinuous action. Since there is no focus on
internal temporal texture in these actions, they are perfective in aspect.
The imperative aspect represents commands, which can occur in all three persons in
Oneida.
The stative suffix represents states: inherent states, experiential states, resultant states,
negative actions (or better, the lack of an action), and current ongoing actions. Notice that
both the serial and the stative can represent current ongoing actions, but not with the same
verb stem. Determining which verb stems will express ongoing current action with the serial
and which with the stative is not entirely straightforward. Chafe (1980) has proposed that the
semantic feature of consequentiality works well in the related language Seneca and it works
reasonably well, but not completely for Oneida. In consequential verbs the action leads to
some change of consequence and for such verbs the stative suffix expresses a resultant state
while the serial expresses the ongoing current action (as well, ambiguously, as a habitual
action), and in nonconsequential verbs the stative suffix expresses an ongoing current action
while the serial expresses the habitual action. But there are exceptions. One important
characteristic of the stative suffix is the effect it has on the pronominal component. The
stative suffix is incompatible with subjective pronominal prefixes so that verbs which
normally require subjective pronominal prefixes in their other aspects switch their allegiance
to the objective pronominals with this particular suffix. The one exception is that the neuter
subjective pronominal (Xa-/w-) is used with the stative suffix to form an impersonal
construction.

"Prepronominal
PrefixesPronominal
PrefixesVerb
StemsAspect
Suffixesas a sequenceof four11All verbs have a component for the verb stem, which itself may be quite simple (some verb
stems are a single phoneme) or quite complex with many morphemes and layers of
derivation. Suffixed to the verb stem is an aspectual component with inflections and some
derivational possibilities. Prefixed immediately to the front of the verb stem is an obligatory
component of pronominal prefixes. Within this component are coded agent, patient, gender,
number and person. The fourth component is a set of eleven morphemes,
up to five of which may occur in a single word. This component is prefixed before the
pronominal component. These are thus sometimes called the pre-pronominal prefixes. Each
of these components has rules for internal structure, rules for morphophonemic alternations
at morpheme boundaries (and rules for alternations due to accent placement), and rules for
cooccurrence restrictions with what may exist in the other components of the word. Each of
these is considered in turn.
3.1 Pre-pronominal Prefixes - The naming of individual morphemes here generally follows
Lounsbury (1953). Some of these are problematic. Since many of the morphemes have a
range of meanings and functions, a single name often falls short of adequately describing that
range. As a consequence there are quite a few proposals for alternative names in the
Iroquoian literature. An attempt is made here to identify those alternatives, especially if the
alternative has gained greater currency.

The future, aorist, and indefinite prefixes coordinate with a particular suffix on verb

sometimes called tense prefixes and sometimes modal or epistemic prefixes. Each has a
variety of functions.",[7]

"6.2.56.2.67.1 Predication - Although a single Oneida verb has within it both the predication and
(pro)nomination to stand as a complete sentence, an Oneida sentence almost always contains
more words. Some simple commands constitute most of the exceptions. Particles often form
constituents with verbs, most occurring before the verb but a few, e.g. the interrogative ka
and several emphatic constructions such as k/? wahe and 4? ne, occurring after it. Verbless
sentences exist where nouns are used with particles (mostly ae) supplying the formal
predication.

more than a single label can suggest.

in timeless conditional statements and often in verbs subordinated to other verbs.

The most generic form of the rule applies to words ending in a vowel or a vowel
plus glottal stop. These final syllables are whispered, including any /h/ that may occur before
the vowel.

kana‘kahle
‘stick’ sentence final form
If the word ends in a consonant plus a resonant plus a vowel, then an epenthetic
vowel (/e/ if the resonant is /l/ or /n/; /o/ if the resonant is /w/; and /i/ if the resonant is /y/)
is inserted after the consonant and the rest of the word is whispered.

This whispering process is somewhat fragile in the current state of the language. For
many speakers it is a quite unconscious and automatic process. Speakers when confronted
with the two pronunciations will select their preferred form (typically the form with
whispering) and report that they have heard other people use the other form, even though
it occurs in their own unguarded speech. There is also variation among speakers. Some
follow the rules as above and others use the process very sparingly so that the whispered
forms hardly ever appear. There are also many reanalyses of individual words so that, for
example, an epenthetic vowel in the whispered form will be reanalyzed as a part of the verb
stem, or the whispered form will be generalized as the only form of the word. For example,
the epenthetic vowel in kandkehle has been reanalyzed as part of the verb stem for some
speakers so that for them Aandkehle is the sentence final form and kandkele? is the sentence
medial form. Nearly all speakers have reanalyzed the progressive suffix -atye- into -ati.
Certain apparent exceptions to the accent placement rule can be understood in light of such
reanalyses from the whispering rules. Notice how the accent on sééf ‘sit!’ appears to violate
the accent shift rule, but the accent shift is blocked by the original double consonant form
sdtya ‘sit! More complete discussions of phonological processes are in Lounsbury (1946) and
Michelson (1988).

3.1.5 Constraints - There are co-occurrence restrictions between the prefixes and the other
components of an Oneida verb. The future, aorist, and indefinite prefixes only occur with the
punctual aspect suffix (in fact one of the three must occur whenever the punctual aspect
suffix is used). The negative does not occur with the punctual aspect suffix (the contrastive
substitutes). Certain counting verbs require one of the counting prefixes (iterative, dualic,
partitive). The particular verb stem and the aspect suffix determine whether the locative
prefixes (cislocative and translocative) indicate location or direction. Verb stems that contain
a reflexive use the dualic prefix to indicate a reciprocal action (they do the action to each
other). Verb stems that contain an instrumental suffix use the locative prefixes to indicate a
suddenness of the action. The partitive prefix often occurs with a number of different
particles before the verb. There are also many verb stems that require one or more prefixes
to make an idiomatic meaning. For these the lexical item is really the combination of the
verb stem and the required prefix(es).",[12]

with an incorporated noun (verbal derivation) and with an unincorporated noun (syntactic
construction). One pattern in all this is that short verbs (single syllables or less) are very
likely to incorporate nouns.","[21, 22]"

"71, Introduction
1.1 Setting - Oneida is a language in the Iroquoian family of North America. It is most
closely related to Mohawk within the northern branch of the Iroquoian family. It is the
traditional language of the Oneida people, one of the tribes of the Iroquoian Confederacy and
the League of Five (later six) Nations. The homeland of the Oneida people is in central New
York state, but currently the territory of the Oneidas is split among three reservations: in
NewYork,Wisconsin,andOntario.","[4, 5]"

following order:partitive
coincident
contrastive
negativetranslocative| aorist | dualicfuture
indefinite
aoristiterative
cislocativeaorist
indefiniteThe aorist and indefinite have multiple positions because, depending on what other prefixes
they occur with, they may be discontinuous or have allomorphs in alternative positions. The
following restrictions on multiple prefixes occur:
The partitive, coincident, contrastive, and negative are mutually exclusive because of
their position.
The translocative and cislocative are mutually exclusive semantically.
The aorist, future, and indefinite are mutually exclusive both by position and by
meaning.
The iterative and cislocative are mutually exclusive by position. When both are needed
semantically, the dualic substitutes for the iterative.
The negative and contrastive are mutually exclusive semantically.
These restrictions reduce what could have been over a thousand combinations of morphemes
down to 163.

chart there are alternates conditioned by the following pronominal component. The alternates
are created by the following rules.
Epenthesis — When combining prepronominal and pronominal prefixes creates a
consonant cluster not allowed in Oneida, an epenthetic /e/ is inserted between the two
components. In addition when a consonant cluster includes prepronominal and pronominal
prefixes and at least one consonant of a verb stem, then even if the cluster is otherwise
allowed in the language, an epenthetic /e/ is still inserted between the prepronominal and
pronominal components.
Glottal loss — If the basic form of a prepronominal component ends in glottal stopand the following pronominal component begins with either /h/ or /s/, then the glottal stop
is deleted.","[7, 8, 9]"
