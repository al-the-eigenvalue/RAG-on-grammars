"I was invited to be guest director of that workshopand supervised the participants in the preparation of grammatical sketches of the
various Uto-Aztecan languages on which they were working. At the end of the workshop it was agreed that the sketches would be revised for publication, resulting in this
series. Volume I of the series consists of my own Overview of Uto-Aztecan Grammar,
which is based on the lecture material I presented during the workshop and provides
fundamental information concerning the Uto-Aztecan language family (including both
synchronic structure and diachronic evolution) and relevant grammatical concepts.
The present volume contains sketches of four modern Aztec dialects. Volume HI,
Uto-Aztecan Grammatical Sketches, is to consist of sketches of five other Uto-Aztecanlanguages:Northern Paiute by John and Joy Anderson; Papago by Dean Saxton;Northern Tepehuan by Burton Bascom; Western Tarahumara by Don Burgess; andCora by Eugene Casad.
The purpose of these sketches is to provide Uto-Aztecan scholars, linguists
generally, and other interested people with reasonably comprehensive basic information
about a variety of Uto-Aztecan languages. To facilitate understanding and comparison,we have adopted fairly uniform transcriptions, abbreviations, and formats. Most of the
notations should be self-explanatory; see Volume I for a complete list. These threevolumes are to be considered an integral unit. The Overview constituting Volume I
provides the background necessary for appreciation of the individual sketches in
Volumes IT and III, which in turn serve to exemplify the points covered in the Overviewand to make possible ready comparison of the languages covered.

Subject RelativesThe relativized noun is normally represented only by the appropriate SUBJ
pronoun prefix on the relativized verb. (See examples above.)
Object RelativesThe relativized noun is normally represented only by the appropriate OBJ
pronoun prefix on the verb. Non-pronominalized subjects tend very strongly to
follow the verb even in cases when ambiguity results. (Presumably this is because the
relativized noun is almost always in focus; in those cases where it is not, the focusedelement will usually have been pronominalized.","[129, 130]"

The presence of a pronominal SUBJ or OBJ is redundant, since these are alreadymarked pronominally on the verb. So their retention usually signals topicalization or
emphasis of some sort. Occasionally, however, their function seems to bedisambiguation of homophonous or nearly homophonous verb forms. (See the following section on Pronoun Copies.)
Topicalization is often signalled by vocal emphasis without any change in word
order.
Pronoun CopiesPronoun affixes agreeing in person and number with the subject and object of a
clause must be copied onto the verb.* Thus, any time a noun is used to identify the
subject or object, it is also represented pronominally in the verb.

"Tetelcingo Nahuatl differs from neighboring Aztec dialects in having converted
the old vowel length distinction into a distinction of tenseness or phonetic placement,and in its elaborate honorific system. The speakers call their language masiewal:, which
doubtless derives from the classical word maaseewalli, which meant plebeian or vassal.
Previous study of Tetelcingo Aztec was done by Richard S. Pittman and Forrest
and Jean Brewer, all of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. The author of this sketch
has been studying Tetelcingo Aztec (between interruptions) for five years.
I would like to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. Pittman and the Brewers
for their personal help and encouragement and for the materials they provided for me
to work with. Especially helpful in preparing the present work have been the Brewers’
Vocabulario Mexicano de Tetelcingo and a concordance of texts collected by them
which was produced at the Oklahoma University Computing Center in May 1969.
lamalso indebted to many inhabitants of Tetelcingo who have taken time to teach me their
language, especially Don Martin Méndez Huaxcuatitla, Don José Catonga, and my closefriend Trinidad Ramirez, who has spent months with me trying to figure out the best
ways to express different concepts in Aztec. Also I would like to acknowledge my
indebtedness to my wife Joy, without whose love, encouragement, help, and cookingI would not have progressed as far as I have in the study of Tetelcingo Aztec, and to
my Master, Jesus Christ, without whose motivation | would probably never have begun
it.
All the errors, omissions, inaccuracies, overstatements, understatements,oversights, misleading comments, over-hasty generalizations, incorrect analyses, etc.
which this sketch doubtless contains are solely my own fault.",[11]

TEXT
The Coyote and the JackrabbitINTRODUCTION
Tetelcingo Nahuatl is spoken in the town of Tetelcingo and its two colonies,
Cuauhtémoc and Lazaro Cardenas, in the municipality of Cuautla, Morelos, Mexico,
about fifty miles southeast of Mexico City. There may be as many as 3,000 speakers.
There are very few monolinguals left; many speakers are more proficient in Spanish
than Aztec.","[8, 9, 10, 11]"

before APPLIC, but elsewhere does not before the CAUS -lte.",[114]

the main verb. The main verb is 3P SG SUBJ for SUBJ clauses, 3P SG OBJ for OBJclauses. Markings of the subordinate clauses are discussed below.

"Quotative sentences alsooften have this order, probably as a stylistic variation. When the subject is a pronoun,
it is normally there only to reflect some sort of emphasis or topicalization, so pronoun
subjects do not follow the verb, except occasionally in quotative sentences.
Topicalization
Topicalization or emphasis is usually signalled by putting the emphasized or
topicalized element first in the sentence, even if this gives an abnormal word order.

"(Verbs ending in any other vowel are extremely rare.) There are a good many pairs
where this difference shows up clearly—in some cases -a and -t might be treated as
separate morphemes with these meanings. -ow-a is the typical TRNS VR and -cwe
or -iews is the typical INTRNS VR. Many verbs have these endings, which are no
longer clearly derived. Many verbs, especially those with CAUS or APPLIC or the
YR -ow, have a PRES TRNS marker -a which appears in PRES and IMPRF but
which drops elsewhere.

The fact that a (TRNS) V stem ending in a will change to « before APPLIC,
