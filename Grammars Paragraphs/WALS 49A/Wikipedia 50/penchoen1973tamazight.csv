In English, this is the case for sentences such as
'It is John who did the damage’
as
opposed to ‘John did the damage’.
Clefting is very frequent in Berber languages in general.
In Tamazight, it is very often used
under conditions where no particular stress or emphasis is intended - particularly in sentences
with the verb g ‘be': aryaz
ag-ga
‘He's a man' (lit,
(It's) a man that he is‘).
Formally, clefting consists in placing the phrase - noun phrase, prepositional phrase, adverbial - at the beginning of the sentence, placing the particle ay
after it and
subordinating the
remainder of the sentence to this particle.
The form of the sentence is thus
bi-partite,
the
clefted phrase juxtaposed with the ay
clause.
In the case of clefting of the subject, object, indirect object or prepositional object noun phrase,
the ay
clause takes the form of a relative clause, i.e. in the case of clefting of the subject
noun phrase, the ay
clause is a subject relative clause with a participle.
Only the singular
participle is used no matter what the number of the clefted noun phrase, a fact which must berelated to the demonstrative nature ofAsin the caseof relativeclauses,ay .78dependencyconditionsapplyin theayclause.","[80, 81, 82, 83]"

3.8.2.3'Participial'Morphology41,AffixesWhen the verb is used in a subject relative clause the verb receives
affixes which have traditionally been called participial.
In Tamazight there are two participial forms according to
whether the antecedent of the relative clause is Singular or plural:
:
Singular:i ---~nPlural:----ninThese affixes are affixed to the intensive, perfect, or perfect negative
stems of the verb
(the
stem which ‘would be used in the third person for verbs with i/a
alternation in the perfect),
the unmarked stem being excluded from relative clauses by dependency
conditions (see Syntax
4.2 below).

satellites, whose position before the verb is obligatory when an aspectual particle is used.

to give one of the values indicated above,i.e.of the verb, or - but rarely ~ the intensive stem,

For other Berber languages, however, it is clear that this is not how the participle was formed historically: in several Berber
languages the suffixes are subject to being moved to preverbal position under conditions
of
negation, much like verb satellites (see below Syntax 4.2) and in Tuareg may even be separated from the verb form, when moved forward, by one or another of the satellite
comple~
ments.

action nouns from verbs and agentive - or subjective - nouns, also formed from verbs.
There are isolated traces of a variety of other noun

personal form.
