"I,The Equational Predicate Phrase
An equational predicate phrase has a structure which may be diagrammedthus:
NP
+ -@The suffix -@ in this formula is the
subordinative
suffix.
This grammatical morpheme is a “case” suffix which marks noun phrases of subordinate status in the sentence in contrast to those noun phrases which do
not have the suffix. A noun phrase followed by this suffix may be termed a
“subordinated noun phrase,” and we may abbreviate the construction as ‘‘NPA.”
Let us examine this suffix in detail before continuing our discussion of the
equational predicate, since it is of great importance in the grammar.
a. The Subordinative -a. The subordinative -@ in Nama is analogous to what
is called a “case” morpheme in other languages. That is, it is a bound morpheme
which indicates the grammatical status of a noun phrase in the sentence. If we
look upon Nama as a “‘case”’ language, then we must recognize two cases: (1) an
“unmarked” case where there is no suffix on the noun phrase, and (2) a
“marked” case with the subordinative -a@ suffix on the noun phrase. There are
also remnants of what might be called an “agentive case,” marked by -i inThe Sentence57certain fixed expressions (see p. 105). However, an analysis of the grammar of
Nama noun phrases in terms of a “‘case system’’ would be unnecessarily complex
since there is really only one grammatically productive morpheme involved. To
describe the distribution of the morpheme -a, and to attempt to give a general
meaning to the morpheme based upon that distribution, is by far the simplest
and best solution.
The question of this -@ morpheme is being brought up here, with the
equational predicate, only because this is the first time we have come across a
construction with this morpheme. Actually, we will be meeting with it again and
again because, like case morphemes in other languages, @ has many “‘uses,”
meaning that it has a complex distribution which makes it difficult for us to
assign a single meaning to it that would cover all of its occurrences. Here is a list
of the constructions in which -d occurs along with the number of the page upon
which the discussion of each of these constructions begins:
Equational Predicate NPa: p. 56.
Direct or Indirect Object NPa: p. 75.
Temporal NPa: p. 105.
NPa before a Subordinating Post-position: p. 101.
Deposed Subject NPa: p. 109.
Interrogative Subject NPa: p. 139-40.
Imperative-Hortative Subject NPa: p. 145.
The term “subordinative” has been chosen for this morpheme in an attempt to
convey the meaning which @ may be said to have in all of these constructions.
The meaning is that “the noun phrase marked by 4 is subordinate in
grammatical status to any other noun phrase without -@ which does occur or
may occur in the sentence.” Of course, what is meant by the phrase
“subordinate in grammatical status” is not meant to be self-evident at this point.
However, as each of the above facets of its distribution is treated, the meaning
should become clearer.
Since -@ is always suffixed to a noun phrase, and since every noun phrase
ends in a pgn suffix, @ always occurs bound to a pgn suffix. As mentioned
earlier (p. 16), there is a morphophonemic change whenever the pgn suffix ends
in a vowel, to reduce the combination to one mora. The phonological nature of
the change has been described previously, but here is a reference table of pgn
suffixes alone and the same suffixes combined with the subordinative -@

-~éDuplications in the table are again marked by numerals which correspond to
those used in previous tables of the pgn suffixes. It will be noted that all nasals
remain syllabic before -@ because they are still morpheme-final. Refer to page 16for a discussion of the morphophonemic changes represented in the table.b. The Equational Sentence. An equational sentence is a sentence with an
equational predicate which, therefore, has the following structure:
NP + Dec + NPaAs in the appositive noun phrase, both of the noun phrases in the equational
sentence have the same referent, so that the pgn suffix on both noun phrases
must be identical. For example, in the equational sentence //’rip ke kxdepa. “He
is the person,” both noun phrases have the 3° masc. sing. suffix -p~-i. It is, of
course, possible for one noun phrase to have one allomorph and the other noun
phrase to have the other allomorph of the same pgn suffix morpheme. For
example, in the sentence //’iip ke xdm-a. “He is the lion,” the first noun phrase
has the -p allomorph, and the second noun phrase has the -i allomorph which,
when followed by the subordinative -@, is deleted so that the result is simply 7.
(See the table above).
There is a special restriction on the occurrence of pronominals in the noun
phrases of an equational sentence. The rule is simply that if there is a
pronominal in one of the noun phrases, there is none in the other. This rule may
be looked upon as a deletion of a redundant pronominal, since both pronominals7The Sentencewould be identical because the pgn suffixes are identical. The actual effect of
this rule is to delete a first or second person pronominal, fii, sit, or sad, from one
noun phrase of the sentence, since the third person pronominal, /[Pit, is not
present anyway, except in the pronoun case. Here are some examples: sadts ke
#ée-Fut'aotsa. “You (masc. sing.) are the leader.”; Ave-Aui’aots ke sadtsa. “Theleader is you (masc. sing.).”; haip ke //ndapa. “The stick is that one.”; //ndap ke
haipa. “That (one) is the stick.”; tifta ke ! ‘ut aota. “1 am the guard, shepherd.”’;Mit'aota ke tiitd. “The guard, shepherd is me.”
There are two ways in which the translations given above do not
accurately convey the meanings of the Nama sentences. First of all, the English
translations do not convey the definiteness of the Nama predicate noun phrase.
For instance, in the first example, ‘““You (masc. sing.) are the leader.” refers to a
definite “leader” who is under discussion. It might better be rendered: “You(masc. sing.) are (that specific) leader.” sadts ke #ae-#uiaotsa. The essentialpoint to keep in mind is that both of the noun phrases in an equational sentence
have a definite referent. There is another sentence construction, the stative
sentence with noun phrase complement, which often ends up being translated
the same way as the equational sentence though quite different in meaning (see
p. 84ff.). We will look at this construction later, but here is an example for
contrast: sadts ke ‘a #ie-Ali’ao. which may be translated “You are a leader,”
“You are leader,” or even “You are the leader,” depending on the context. Thisconstruction is parallel to: sadts ke ’a kai. “You are big.” The equational sadts ke
Hie-Aui’aotsa would be parallel to sadts ke kditsa. “You are the big one.” Thesecond way that the translation is inaccurate is in the fact that it conveys the
present tense, while the Nama sentences are tenseless. Thus, in the context ofa
past-tense narrative, sadts ke #ae-#ut’aotsd. might be translated “You were the
leader.” It is, however, possible to get the idea of tense across by making one of the
noun phrases a relativization of a stative sentence with a noun phrase complement:
sadts ke #ae-Aii’ao ké “ittsa. “You were the leader,” literally “You are the one
who was the/a leader.”; #de-#ui’ao ké ‘ilts ke sadtsa. “The leader was you,”
literally, “The one who was the/a leader was you.” However, this is a result of
the process of relativization, not of the equational sentence, though the
equational sentence construction often occurs with one of its noun phrases being
the product of relativization. (See p. 124 for relativization.)

vowelmora./i/, but this vowel sound is short, toneless, and does not represent an extraComparing this table with the table of pgn suffixes on p. 42, we can see
that in these suffixes the morpheme structure is regular, consisting of one CV
mora, while some of the pgn suffixes have the form C and others VN. Perhaps
the most interesting correspondence is that between the 3° masc. sing. object
suffix -pi and the corresponding pgn suffix -p--i, which can lead us to a good
etymological explanation of the allomorphy of the latter suffix.
The existence of this complete system of object suffixes is interesting
because it appears to be entirely unnecessary, since for any of these suffixes on
the verb may be substituted a pronoun as the first NPA with no change of
meaning. The first example sentence is a good illustration: //’fiku ke //’fipa ké
mui. and //’tiku ke ké muupi. both mean “They (masc., pl.) saw him.” In the
first sentence “‘him” is expressed by a pronoun NP& //’/ipa, and in the second by
an object suffix -pi. The construction with a pronoun NPa is the more frequent
in texts. The only difference in meaning between the two constructions appears
to be one of emphasis, the construction with the object suffix representing a
very low degree of emphasis on the “patient” of the verb, in this case “him.”",[47]
"Thefirst and second personthey would occur is either: (1) the second or’later noun phrase in an appositive
noun phrase (see page 45), or (2) in an equational predicate (see page 58). Thethird person pronominal, //’f1, may be present if: (1) the noun phrase occurs in
an equational predicate (see page 58), or (2) there is no noun root in the noun
phrase and none of the other five order classes are filled. We may call this last
exceptional case the pronoun case which we will now treat in detail.d. The
Pronoun.
A “pronoun” may be defined as “a simple noun
phrase containing neither a noun root nor any construction filling order classes 1
through 5,” or positively as “a noun phrase containing only a pronominal, an
optional noun derivational suffix (the diminutive -r6), and a pgn suffix. Since
the pronoun construction is of very frequent occurrence in the language, the
total set of possible pronouns, minus the diminutive, is tabulated below.",[29]
"A Nama noun with indefinite gender is difficult to translate intoEnglish. The simplest approximation is to translate it with the “indefinite
article” of English, e.g., kxdep “the male person,” kxde’i “a person.”
Unfortunately, the meanings of the English articles and the Nama genders do not
correspond very closely at all. First of all, the Nama indefinite gender is used
much less frequently in Nama than is the indefinite article in English.
Correspondingly, the Nama masculine and feminine genders are used more
frequently in Nama than is the definite article in English. Perhaps the best way
to convey the meaning of kxde’? is to translate it “some person or other.” Thus,
tatdp “the father,” tatd’i’'“‘some father or other,” /irés “the female jackal,” /i7i’7
“some jackal or other,’ xuup “the thing,” xuu’7 “something,” skdli “the
school,” skdi’t “some school or other.” There is a phonological peculiarity ofZoThe Noun fhrasethe morpheme -7 which remains to be mentioned. The glottal stop, /’/, may be
elided in the flow of conversational speech, e.g., kxde’i may become kxoet?, but
the final /i/ is still fully syllabic.
Any noun may be inflected for the plural, with the slight irregularity that
mass nouns take the common plural suffix -7--77, no matter which gender is
assigned to them in the lexicon. Thus we have #'uup “the food (a certain
type),” #'uun “the food (a variety of types as in a meal)”; mass nouns,
dome os
however, very often take the indefinite gender in the singular, e.g., #uut
“food, some food or other,” #’00’i “salt.” The last example would never have
occasion to be used in the plural, which is true of many other mass nouns. The
example might be glossed ‘“‘some kind of salt or other,” but since there is only
one kind of salt, such a gloss would be redundant.
With the exception of a small group of nouns, a noun is inflected for the
dual when its referent is two individuals, and for the plural when its referent is
three or more individuals. The masculine dual and plural suffixes, -kx@ and -ku,
are used if all the individuals referred to would be denoted by nouns with
masculine gender, and the feminine dual and plural, -r@ and -f7, if they would be
denoted by nouns having feminine gender. With animate nouns, of course,
biological sex determines the gender, with inanimate nouns, the gender is
arbitrarily assigned by the lexicon though it may be switched by the gender
replacement mentioned earlier. Thus we have: kxéekxd “the two male persons,”
kxoeku “the three or more male persons,” tardra “the two women,” tardti “the
three or morewomen,”#xanira“thetwo letters,” #xaniti “the three or moreletters,” ’omkxd “the two big houses, apartment or office buildings,” ‘omku
“the three or more big houses, etc..”
If the noun refers to a group of individuals that would be denoted by a
mixtureof genders,thecommondualandpluralsuffixes, -r@ and ---in, areused, e.g., kxOerd “the two persons, male and female,” kxden “the group of
persons containing both males and females,” /irira “the two jackals, male and
female,” /irii “the group of jackals containing both males and females.” The
common gender suffixes are used with some inanimate nouns when the plural
denotes a group of things some of which may be denoted by nouns having
masculine gender and some by nouns having feminine gender, e.g., xuun “the
things.” The common gender was grouped with the indefinite gender into
““common-indefinite” because the common gender suffix, ~i~-i7, is sometimes
used to denote a plurality of individuals which is unknown, hypothetical, or
non-existent, thus xuuwrt may mean “some things,” and #’uinh “some food.” It is
up to context or paraphrase, however, to convey the meaning of indefiniteness,
since the forms are identical to the common plurals.
There is a small group of nouns denoting body parts that are usually26NamaHottentot Grammarfound in pairs, which never take the dual suffixes, only the plural, despite the
fact that it is almost always two individuals which are denoted. This is the case
even if the number /dm “two” precedes them. Thus, /dm !’6mku means “thetwo hands”; the form is never */dm !’6mkxa. Other examples are: //’oaku “the
arms,”muuti“theeyes,”//Oati‘‘theknees,”#’aiti“the feet,” /nuuku“thelegs,” #aéti “the ears.”
It may have been noted that the feminine and indefinite common dual
suffixes, -rd and -rd, are homophonous, yet they should be considered separate
morphemes because feminine and common gender are distinguished in the plural
suffixes, -t7 and -i--i7.
b. Derivation. The term “derivation,” as it is used in linguistic description, is almost always ambiguous and covers two very different linguistic
phenomena. A derivational affix may be: (a) an affix which, when added to a
root, adds an increment of meaning to the meaning of the root without the
resulting stem having a different distribution than would a stem consisting of
the root alone (Examples would be the diminutive suffix in many European
languages, or the comparison of adjectives in English.); or it may be (b) an affix
which, when added to a root, results in a stem which has an entirely different
distribution class than would a stem consisting of the root alone (Examples
would be affixes which are called by such names as: ‘‘deverbal-nominalizer,”
“deadjectival-verbalizer.”) The ambiguous use of the term “derivation” can do
nothing but confuse the description of any language which has both of the
above phenomena; this would certainly be the case in Nama. So, a terminologica] distinction will be introduced for the present study. An affix of type (a) will
be called, for the case of nouns, a “noun derivational affix” to be treated under
the heading of “Noun Derivation.” An affix of type (b) will be called, for the
case of nouns, a “noun deriving affix” to be treated under the heading “Derived
Nouns,”or, if it is the nounrootwhichis beingconsidered,“DerivedNounRoots.” The same terminological distinction will be maintained in the case of
adjectives and verbs.
In the preceding discussion of gender and number in the Nama noun, all
of the examples contained noun stems which consisted of a simple noun root.
The noun stem may, however, consist of a noun root plus a derivational suffix.
Therearetwosuchsuffixes:thediminutivesuffix, -rd, and the augmentativesuffix, -kara.
When added to a noun root, the suffix -rdé conveys the meaning “smallness
of size,” e.g., kxderds“thelittle female person,” xuur6’i“some little thing,”tatdrop “the little father,” //amro’i “a little (bit of) water.” Like the diminutive
in many languages, and like the word “little” in English, -r6 also may convey anat‘The Noun Phraseattitude of fondness, e.g., mamards does not necessarily mean “the mother who
is small in size”; it may just be an affectionate way of saying “mother.” This
same diminutive suffix is used for adjective and verb derivation as well.
The meaning of the suffix -kara might better be described as “superaugmentative” than simply “‘augmentative.” When added to a root is conveys
the meaning “tremendous size,” e.g., ‘dokdrap “the enormous man,” ‘omkaras
“the enormous house.” Often, gender replacement accompanies the use of -kara,
‘omkaraku “the enormous houses, office or apartment buildings”’; the result is
to intensify the augmentative meaning, though gender replacement may add a
tone of deprecation, which -kara by itself would not have. -kara is only used in
noun derivation.c. The Noun Root. The root of a Nama noun may be either a_ simple
noun root, a derived noun root, ora compound noun root.
(1) The Simple Noun Root
In all of the examples cited in this section, the root has been a simple, i.e.,
monomorphemic, noun root. Since the subclassification of these roots has
already been discussed in connection with gender and number, there is little left
to say about them here. There is one type of root, though, that deserves special
mention. Noun roots whose meanings must be defined in terms of personal
relationships, i.e., family or friendship, all exist in two forms. One form is
simply the root itself. e.g., /dap “the brother,” /das “the sister,” /hoop “the
male comrade,” hdrén “‘the friends.” The other is the root plus the suffix -sd,
e.g., /dasap “the brother,” Idasas “the sister,” /hoosdép “the male companion,”
horésan “the friends.” The two forms are completely interchangeable; -sa
contributes nothing to the meaning.
(2) The Derived Noun Root
Strictly speaking, there is only one true noun deriving suffix. A derived
nounroot may, however, also result from sentenceembedding,specifically, bynominalization or relativization. A detailed discussion of embedding will be
delayed until the very end of this description because it presupposes a
knowledge of sentence structure.
The suffix -si may be added to any adjective resulting in a noun root
having masculine gender and thus taking the suffix -p in the singular. The
resulting noun is the generic term for the quality which the adjective denotes,
e.g., kat “big, great,” kdisip “bigness, greatness,” /‘urixd “dirty,” /urixasip
“dirtiness,” /’am’o “endless,” /‘’am’osip “endlessness, eternity.” The combination of suffixes -s? plus -p may also be added to many animate noun stems with
the same semantic result, e.g., kxde’? “some person,” kxdesip “humanness,humanity,” //uiu’i “some parent,” //uusip “the quality of being parental,” kdd7Nama28Hottentot Grammar“some ruler,” kddsip “domination, dominion.” In the case of the use of -s? with
noun stems, however, the stem plus -si, without -p, may be used as an adjective;
this point will be discussed under “derived adjectives.”
(3) The Compound Noun Root
A compound noun root has two constituents the second of which is
always a simple noun root whose animacy and gender almost always determine
the animacy and gender of the compound as a whole; the first constituent is
generally either a verb root or another noun root, but in a few cases it may be an
adjective. The second constituent, the noun root, undergoes tonal changes as
part of a compound in that, whatever combination of tones the noun root may
have as a separate item in the lexicon, all its tones become mid tones when it
constitutesthesecondparta compoundofnounroot. Tonetically, these midtones are slightly lower than are mid tones in a simple noun root. The special
behavior of this second constituent, in tending to govern animacy and gender
and in its morphotonemic changes, merit it being given a special name; it shall be
called henceforth the “nuclear noun root” of the compound noun root.
Many of the more frequent compound noun roots in Nama result from the
combination of a limited class of nuclear noun roots with either: (a) any verb
root, or (b) any other noun root. This class of nuclear noun roots may be called
“productive,” and the results “productive compounds”. In other compounds, the
combination of roots is not so free in that only specific combinations occur.
Such compounds may be called “special compounds.” Each type will now be
discussed and exemplified in turn.
There are two productive nuclear noun roots which may be combined with any verb root to form a compound. They are the roots in:
/ais “the manner,” and ‘dop “the man.” Examples of compounds with
the first are: #’ui/aus “the manner of eating,” with #7%i% “eat”; /nari/aus
“the manner of stealing, the stealthy manner,” with /nari “steal,” /hdd/aus “the
manner of speaking or conversing,” with ‘hdd “speak or converse.” Examples of
compounds with the second are: /%1’aop “the shepherd or guard,” with /’1“watchover”;//xda//xaa’aop“themissionary,”with//xda//xaa“teach,”{narVaop “the thief,” from /nari “steal”; Ade--Autaop “the leader,’ with
#de-Fut “lead.” The verbs used in these latter compounds can be seen to
describe the social role of an individual rather than an activity which the
individual happens to be performing. (In that case a relativization would be used,
e.g., Fde-Ail ra “dop “the man who is leading.”) Although ""dop is always of
masculine gender when it occurs as a simple noun root, compounds with this
root may have feminine gender if the individual to be described is female, e.g.,!uvaos “the female shepherd,” /nart’aos “the female thief.” Both /atis and ’dop
mayoccurassimplenounsina nounphrase,in whichcasethereis noThe Noun PhrasePay)morphotonemic change, e.g., /dri /aus “the tough manner,” kat ‘dop “the big
man.” The examples are combinations of adjective plus noun which are not to
be confused with compounds.
There are two productive nuclear noun roots which may be combined with
any other noun root to form a compound. These two roots, unlike /au and ’do,
have no gender or animacy assigned to them in the lexicon and, in fact, they
cannot occur as simple noun roots, only as the second constituent of a
compound. The gender of the compounds which they can form is either: (a) thegender of the noun root with which they are combining, or (b) indefinite gender
(which any noun stem may be given). The indefinite gender is most common
with these compounds. The roots are: /noa “type of,” and hda “and other things
of the sort.”’ Examples of compounds with the first are: kxde/noap “the type of
male person,” from kxdep ‘“‘male person”; kxde/noa’i “‘a type of person,” the
same with indefinite gender; /‘apé/noati “the types of decisions,” with /‘apéti
“the decisions”; /‘apé/noa’i “some type of decision,” the same with indefinite
gender and singular number; /ai/noa’i “some type of manner.” Examples of
compounds with haa are: saruihdan “cigarettes and other things (associated with
smoking),” with sardén “cigarettes” with indefinite gender; “ddelédhaam
“Adelaide and the others (who live with her),” with ‘ddeléds “Adelaide” andcommon gender; prdinhdaku “Brian and the guys (who are with him),” with
prain-i “Brian.” It will be seen that plural number always occurs with haa
compounds. Part of the gloss for each of the preceding examples was put in
parentheses because that part of the meaning was not conveyed by the Nama
form but rather was derived from the context in which each of these words
occurred and may perhaps clarify the use of these hada compounds. The words
are very imprecise out of context, but in their context they are not so, since
there it is clear who or what the “other things of the sort” are. They are simply a
convenient device for naming a group of things by whichever member of the
group is of primary interest.
The remaining type of compound noun root is the special compound.
Each member of this type is a separate item in the lexicon, i.e., each
combination is unique. Many of these compounds, in fact, can be seen to have
been “special creations” which were made under the impact of Westernization.
Native Nama roots were combined to create names for things which were
unknown to the speakers of the language before the advent of the Europeans in
southern Africa. Some examples are: /x66’oms “‘the jail,” from the verb /xd0
“catch” and ‘oms “the house”; /xddkxoep “‘the jailbird,” from the same verb
and kxdep “the male person”; #’odkunis “the airplane,” from the root in #’odp
“the wind” and kunis “the wagon or vehicle”; /’urthaap “the bicycle,” from the
root in /’urtp “the iron or metal” and hddp “the male horse”; /’urftaop “theOUNama Hottentot Grammarrailroad tracks,” from /‘urf and tdop “the road”; ’d/#oas “the East,” from ’dts
“face” and #’ods “the big wind.”
Some compound noun roots of this type have resulted from the
adaptation of words borrowed from Afrikaans. In these compounds, the nuclear
noun root is a native Nama root and the other constituent is a borrowed word.
Typical examples are the days of the week, e.g., sdvitatsees “the Sunday,” from
the Afrikaans word “sontag” and the Nama word tsées “the day”; frditatsees“the Friday,” from the Afrikaans “‘freitag” and tsées. (These words minus the
suffix -s may be used as time adverbials with the meanings “Sunday” and
“Friday.”) Notice that the Afrikaans words are borrowed as units withoutineNounStFnrase

“the Nama language,” nama !huup “Namaland,” nama kx6de’i “some Nama
person,” /hui kxoep “the male European person.”
(2) The Derived Adjective
A derived adjective consists of a noun or verb root plus an adjective
deriving suffix. An adjective deriving suffix is “productive” if it may be added to
any noun root or any verb root to form an adjective; it is “special” if it mayanalysis; “tag” means “day.” A few compound noun roots have resulted fromonlythe adaptation of Afrikaans words ending in a final released [k] sound. This
sound was folk-etymologized into the nuclear noun root kxdep or kxdes though
the meanings of the resulting compounds have nothing to do with “persons” at
all. For example: trénkxoes the “jail,” from Af. “tronk” meaning “jail”;
priukxoep “the pants,” from Af. “broek” meaning “pants”; rookxoes “themorphologically restricted. Besides forming an adjective from a noun or verb
root, suffixes of both types also add an element of meaning.
The two most frequently used productive suffixes have meanings which
are opposite to each other. They are -xa “attributive,” and -’o “privative.” Either
of these may be used with any noun or verb root. The precise translation into
English depends on which class of root the suffix is added to, noun or verb.
When suffixed to a noun root, -x@ can usually be translated ‘‘full of—,” when
suffixed to a verb, “having a tendency to—,” where the blanks are to be filled by
the translation of the root. Similarly, -’o can usually be translated “‘lacking—”
with a noun root, and “having a tendency not to—” with a verb root. There isdress,”fromAf.“rok”meaning‘‘dress”;kérkxoep“thechurch,”fromAf.“kerk” meaning “church” also kérkxep by elision of the /o/. This method of
adaptation has the advantage of providing an easy pronunciation of the
obligatory gender suffix.","[19, 20, 21, 22]"
"Gender and Number.masculine, feminine,The Namalanguage distinguishes three genders:and indefinite-common; and three numbers: singular, dual,and plural. Each combination of gender and number is indicated by a particularsuffix, two of which have two allomorphs each. The suffixes are as follows:masculinesingular
-p ~-idual
-kxaplural
-kufeminine-S-ra-ttindefinitecommoni-ra-n-inThe allomorphs of the masculine singular and the indefinite-common plural
suffixes are phonologically conditioned, and the conditioning is the same in both
cases. The second allomorph of each, -i and -i7, is used only after stems ending in
a consonant, which means after the nasal resonants, /n/ and /m/, in native Namawords such as xdr-i “the lion” and //an-i “the meat,” and after the resonants /1/and /r/, as well as /m/ and /n/, in borrowed words such as sk6l-i “the school,”
méester-i “the teacher,” tom-i “Tom,” and jén-i “John.” Examples of -if are
rare but do occur, e.g., méesterin “the teachers, common plural.”
With regard to the question of gender, noun stems are divided into two
main classes: “animate,” containing stems referring to people and animals, and
“inanimate,” containing all other stems.
An animate noun stem is inflected for masculine or feminine genderaccording to the biological sex of the individual(s) referred to, e.g., /irip “‘themale jackal,” /iris “the female jackal,” kxdep “‘the male person,” kxoes “the
female person.” A few noun stems referring to human beings have sex contained
in their meanings and hence only occur with one gender, e.g., gop “the man or
husband,” tards “the woman or wife,” tdtdp ‘“‘the father,” mamds “the mother.”
An inanimate noun stem has either masculine or feminine gender assigned
to it arbitrarily in the lexicon of the language. There are a few pairs of inanimatenouns having phonologically identical stems which may lead us to speculate
about possible original meanings for the genders when applied to inanimate
nouns, e.g. fdop “the road,” taos “‘the gate (which tends to be on a road,” /’dap
“the river,” /’das “the town (which tends to be on a river),” but such pairs are
not common and will not permit us to set up any reliable rule for the assignment
of gender to inanimate nouns. Names of cities always have feminine gender, e.g.,“Windhoek,” johdnespérs[aé//ams“Johannesberg,’ and names of countriestend to have masculine gender, e.g., seetafrikap “South Africa,” ‘amérikap “the
U.S.’ We can see the source of this rule in cases where the name of the country
ends in a stop consonant, e.g., nju jook ti ’aas “New York, lit., the city of New
York,” (?inklant ti fhuup “England, lit., the country of England.” These
circumlocutions tend to be used when a gender suffix after the name would be
difficult for a Nama speaker to pronounce, but they show clearly that the
generic terms /das “city” and /huup “land or country” are the source of the rule
for assigning gender to the names of cities and countries. All inanimate nouns
which have been borrowed from other languages, whether Afrikaans, English, or
are assigned either masculine or feminine gender. Because the
German
assignment of gender in the Nama lexicon is arbitrary, many of these borrowed
words are used sometimes with one gender and sometimes with the other with
no difference in meaning, e.g., skoLi and skdls “‘the school” alternate freely.
Some words have become established in usage with one gender, e.g., pléns “the
plane,” and pén-i “the pen,” but there is no perfectly reliable way to say why
one gender has been chosen over the other. Though my informants have
volunteered several theories on the subject, viz., that long things tend to be
masculine and round things feminine, or that impressive things tend to be
masculine,thereareso manynounswhichdo not conformto any such rules,especially in native Nama words, that we really have to discount these theories.
Although every inanimate noun stem is assigned a gender in the lexicon,
any such noun may be used with the suffix of the other gender to express that
thereissomethingunusualaboutthereferentof thenoun,e.g.,’oms“thehouse,” ’om-i “the big house, apartment or office building,” muiti “eyes,”
muuku “eyes open wide in astonishment,” pén-i “the pen,” péns “the unusually
fat pen.” This phenomenon may be called the morpheme of “gender
replacement.” The exact meaning of this morpheme cannot be pinned down
precisely because it varies according to the noun stem with which it occurs and
according to the larger linguistic and extra-linguistic context. The usual meaning
conveyed is unusual largeness of size but often with overtones of disgust or
derogation, e.g., sams “the breast,” sam-i “the big ugly breast,” ‘ams “the mouth,”
‘am-i “the big, fat mouth.” If it is not unusual for the referent of a noun to be
large, gender replacement may actually convey the opposite meaning, e.g., xaasNama Hottentot Grammar24“the penis,” xdap “‘the small penis.” In some cases of gender replacement there
are no emotional overtones whatsoever, ‘om-i “the big house, etc.” is such a
case. We may generalize by saying that gender replacement conveys the meaning
“largeness of size with derogation” when largeness is an undesireable characteristic of the referent of the noun stem, it conveys simply “largeness of size”” when
largeness is neither desireable nor undesireable, and it may even convey the
meaning “smallness of size’’ if smallness is undesireable. The effective use of
gender replacement contributes much to emotional expressiveness in the use of
the Nama language; when it is to be used is actually more a matter of “style”
than grammar. There are a few pairs of nouns with identical stems which have
undoubtedly resulted from gender replacement at one time but have become
established with permanent and separate meanings, e.g., #xanis “the letter,
book,” #xanip “the newspaper, official document.”
In the diagram at the beginning of this section was the category
“indefinite-ccommon” about which no mention has yet been made. The
hyphenated term for this gender category may be a trifle misleading.
“Indefinite” and “common” are two essentially different gender categories;
“indefinite” is a category independent of number, while “common” is a
category only applicable to non-singular number since it involves the combination of masculine and feminine genders. It just happens that the categories share
two members, the dual -ra and the plural -7~-i7. The reason for this will be
discussed shortly whenthe question of number is taken up; first, we will discussthe “indefinite.”
No noun stem, be it animate or inanimate or any other category yet to be
discussed, is assigned the indefinite gender in the lexicon. At the same time, anynoun stem may be used with this gender, which completely replaces any gender
which may be assigned to the noun stem in the lexicon, conveying the meaning
that the referent of the noun stem is unknown, hypothetical, or evennon-existent.","[18, 19]"
"The fourth order class before the noun may be represented by a
demonstrative. All demonstratives are simple, with the exception of one
demonstrative phrase constructed around the simple demonstrative /nii “some,”
therearesix of them in the language. Theyare: nee “this,” //nda “that,”nati “that (contrastive),” maa “what,” //xad “the same,” and /nii “some.” The
interrogative demonstrative maa will be discussed with the interrogative noun
phrase. The glosses represent the usual approximate translations, the precise
Nama meanings, or “‘rules for their use,” require further discussion since they are
very closely connected with the speech situation and the structure of discourse.
When a speaker of the language is referring to persons or things actually
present at the time of speaking, he will use nee with a noun if the referent of the
noun is physically near to him, e.g., nee kxdep “this male person,” and //nda if it
is not, e.g., //nda kxdep “that male person.” The English translation of the latter
example, however, is too “demonstrative,” so to speak. The word //nda is used
much more frequently in Nama than is the word “that” in English and
represents a much lower degree of deixis comparatively; we often have totranslate //nda with the English article “the” though, then, the degree of deixis
in the gloss will probably be too low. A certain indication of this low degree of
deixis is the fact that //nda may never be used contrastively with nee. For
example, if there are two individuals, one nearby and one farther away, a
speaker would never say *nee kxdep tsit //nda kxdep to mean “this male person
and that male person.’ He would say rather nee kxdep tsit nau kxoep, which
brings us to our next demonstrative, ndu. The word nai is used, in an immediate
speech situation, to identify the farther member in a contrast of proximity, such
as in the last example. In fact, if neither of the individuals to be identified arenear at hand, ndvi may be contrasted with //naa, e.g., //nda kxdep tstt nau kxoep
“thatmalepersonandthat39previously-mentioned character, whether present or not, is being contrasted with
another. In that case, nee or //nda occurs preceding the noun which denotes theClass 4: The DemonstrativeandThe Noun Phraseothermaleperson.”",[26]
"The Compound Post-positionCompound post-positions are bi-morphemic, and both of the morphemes
(CV(C)V). In some
belong to the morpheme structure category of Roots
compounds, the component morphemes are both simple post-positions; in
others, only the second member of the compound is a post-position, while the
first member can be identified with a noun root. The latter type of compound is
undoubtedly of metaphorical origin.
The compound post-positions of Nama are the following:
“on top of” from: #’am “over” plus ‘ar “fon, onto”
from: /na@ “‘in, into”’ plus ‘uu “along”
“through”
“behind; after” the first root of which is identifiable with that in
kxdos “buttocks,” and the second with that in /aap “back”

expressions” which, while not having the structural form of post-positions, are104Nama Hottentot Grammarfunctionally equivalent to post-positions. These must always be preceded by an
associative and consist of a noun plus post-position which is ’d7 “ton, onto” in all
recorded cases. We might compare them with combinations like “in front of,”
“instead of,” or ‘at the foot of” in English. Some common ones are: ""ams ""di“instead (of),” literally “on the mouth (of)” as in: //’fip ti ‘ams “4i “instead of
him”; kxdos ‘ai “behind,” literally “at buttocks (of)” as in //’fip ti kxdés “ai
“behind him”; /agp ‘di also “behind, but literally “at the back (of); /aus “az
“like, in the same manner as,” literally “on the manner’; tom-i di also “like, in
the same manner as.” It is expressions such as these which might well be the
etymological source of compound post-positions.
The list given above is probably not exhaustive, but it does include the
most commonly found forms.

"The Hortative SentenceA hortative sentence is an imperative-hortative sentence whose subject NPais in the first or third person. In contrast to the imperative sentence, the subjectNPa of a hortative sentence may not be deleted, except in the case of subject
deposition as explained in chapter VI where the subject NPa is represented bya
subject indicator (si). Note the following examples: /uike ré! “Let us (ke,masc., pl.) go (Jui)! or “Let’s go!,” miita ré! “Let me (-ta) say (mii)!”’ Despitethe fact that they are translated by “us” and “me” into English, the suffixes -ke
and -ta indicate the subject. The full pronoun deposed subject NPa is deleted.
The most usual form of the hortative sentence is introduced by the
hortative conjunction ‘a. This ’a causes obligatory subject deposition just as doesany sentence conjunction. In the sentence ‘ake //ndapa liu tsti /lam’é sti #an!",[80]

were analyzable, and a comparison of this Nama paradigm with those of other
Khoisan languages does reveal this to be the case, but such a discussion would be
out of place here.person pronominal, //’i7 is obligatorily absent.",[28]

tartkxa “who (masc. dual),” tarit? “who (fem. plural),” but this is rarely the
case when the unknown referent is inanimate, so that pgn suffixes other than -7
on taré rarely occur. There may even be a second person pgn suffix on fart,
though the result is very hard to translate, e.g., tarts “who you (masc. sing.),”
tartso ‘“‘who you (fem. plural).” There is one construction with the interrogative
pronominal taré that contains a noun root, and that is taré xuu’i “what thing,”
which is just about synonymous with faré7 “what.” Aside from taré xuu’t,
nothing intervenes between the interrogative pronominal and the pgn suffix.
Though it is slightly out of place here, it should be mentioned that, when
they occur in interrogative sentences, interrogative noun phrases, such as the
pronouns above, almost always are followed by the suffix -@ with accompanying
morphophonemic changes. All of this will be discussed with the interrogative
sentence (p. 139), but a certain contraction phenomenon involving the pronoun
taré’i plus -@ deserves special mention. With the morphophonemic changes (see
p. 16), taré’t plus a becomes taré’é. This very frequently occurring word is often

shortened to tad’é in speech at a normal conversational speed, though it is always

taré’é in deliberate speech.

“modifier,” may be diagrammed thus:meaning in Nama which the words “attributive” and “privative” accurately
describe. Here are some examples: //amxa !xdis “the watery place,” from thenoun root in //am-i “the water’’; //ani’o !xdis “the waterless place”; //xaéxa taop

Fatherland,” from the nounThe adjective will be discussed first.
a. The Adjective. An adjective may be either a simple adjective or a
derived adjective.
(1) The Simple Adjective
Nama has a rather limited number of monomorphemic adjectives but these
simple adjectives are frequently used. Some of the more common ones are:
kat
lai
Fxam“big, great”
‘good, desireable”
“young”#xart
tsuu
/’oro“small”
“bad, annoying”
“old”root in //uup“the father” (/hudp means “earth,land”); //’oréxa kxoeku “the deceitful male persons,” from the verb root //’oré
“tie”; //nau-/ndmxd ‘édop “the obedient man,” from the (compound) verb root
//nait-/nam “obey”; //nait-/nam’o ‘Gop “the disobedient man.” It might be noted
here that these two suffixes are often used with compound verbs in which the
second verb root is /nam “love, like,” as in the last example, or tsaa “try,
experience”; in compound verb roots, these two roots emphasize a tendency
toward a particular activity.
Another productive adjective-deriving suffix is -s¢ which may be added to
any verb root to form an adjective with the meaning “able to be—ed,” e.g., kéésa“visible,” from the verb root kéé “see”; //naiisa “audible,” from the verb //naiuNama32Hottentot Grammar“hear”; /hadsa “able to be met,” from the verb root /haé “meet.” This suffix is
frequently used with reduplicated verb roots, in which case it must be translated
a bit differently, e.g., tstiu-tsuiusa xuu’i ‘‘a tragic thing,” from the reduplicated
verbroottsuwitsuie“tocauseto suffer”; puri-purisa“wonderful,”fromthereduplicated verb root puripuru “to cause to wonder.” There is a morphotonemic change in the second half of the reduplicated verb root before -sa in
that all of the tones of that root are raised in relative pitch to the other tones in
the word; this change is marked by the hyphen.
One adjective-deriving suffix in the language presents a problem in
description because its distribution is rather complicated; it is somewherebetween a “productive” and a “special” suffix. Let us divide its distribution into
three smaller distributions: (a), (b), and (c). The form of the suffix is -sd in all
cases, but its meaning is clearly analyzible only in distribution (a). In this
distribution, the suffix -sd is added to a small number of verb roots to form an
adjective with the meaning “‘intrinsically—ed.” For example: #naasd haip “the
dry stick,” with the verb root #naz “dry out (by itself)”; /nddsd tdop “the quietThe Noun Fnorase33The suffix -ts?, a frequent adjective-deriving suffix in texts of the Nama
dialect of Nama, is not used in the Damara dialect. The meaning of -tsi is the
same as the meaning of -sd and it has the same complex distribution as -sd.
Damara speakers, though they tend not to use adjectives with -ts/, understand
them and accept them as correct.
The “special” adjective-deriving suffix -tsémd, sometimes pronounced
-tsmda in rapid speech, occurs with a couple of roots where it appears to have an
“apperceptive” meaning, e.g., “Uitsdmd “alive,” with the root in dip “life”;
der.
,
ditsdmé “lone, alone,” with the verb root “di ‘‘to be first” which is not used as a
simple verb root but occurs in many derived words; Addrdkatsdmd “complete,”
with the universal hodrdéka “all.” The meaning might be roughly translated:
“feeling it/him/herself to be—.” It is likely that -tsdmd is etymologically related
to the verb root tsda “feel, try, experience.”
The suffix -re forms adjectives describing sex membership from the roots
in ’dop “the man” and tards “the woman,” e.g., dore kxdep “the male person,”tardre kxde’i “some female person.”road,” with the verb root /nd6 “quiet down (by itself)”; /drisd taop “the hotAnother special suffix -s? derives adjectives from noun roots which meanroad,” with the verb root /dm “warm up (by itself)’; /’dasd tsées “the full day,
the whole day,” with the verb root /’6a “‘fill up (by itself).” The suffix has no
connotation of a completed action, such a meaning would be conveyed by
another construction. (It would be by relativization of a sentence with perfective
aspect, e.g., /nO6 hda téop “the road which has quieted down.”) In distribution
(b), we have pairs of adjectives having identical meanings and differing in form
only in that one consists of a root plus -sd and the other of the same root alone.
For example: ‘anu kxdep, ‘anusd kxéep “the proper male person”; #’06 taop,
#’o6sé taop “the narrow road, path”; /’dd xuup, /’ddsd xuup “the sharp thing”
or “the new thing.” In these cases, the root to which -sé may be added is not a
verb root because it is not found in verbs, so we must consider it a type of
simple adjective. Yet -sd may not be added to any of the common simple
adjectives listed earlier, i.e., forms such as *kdisd for “big,” or */émsd for
“difficult” do not occur. In distribution (c), -sdé occurs after a root which does
not occur as a simple noun or verb root, or adjective. For example: ’fisd ‘oms
“the beautiful house,” also ‘iixd ’oms with the same meaning (xd with high tone
only occurs in this one word); we also find this root in a reduplicated form fifi“behaves in a—ly manner,” e.g., //uissi “Gop “the fatherly man.” It is probablyb. The Adverb, An adjective may optionally be preceded by a manner
adverb, though the only such adverb to occur with any frequency is kdise “very,“make beautiful.” For distributions (b) and (c) we may retain the meaning of -sdvery much,” e.g., kdise ‘fixd /Oati “the very beautiful daughters,”indistribution(a)as“intrinsically—(ed)”sothatitwilljustbeaddedredundantly in case (b) when, e.g., “the narrow path” and “the intrinsically
narrow path” do not mean anything very different. The probable cause of this
complicated distribution is phonological and semantic change. The adjective ‘anu
“right, proper” probably comes historically from the verb /’anu “‘to clean.” The
adjective #’06 may have come from a verb which meant “‘to sharpen,” etc.the same -si, etymologically, that is used freely to derive nouns from adjectives
in combination with the masculine gender suffix -p.
The suffix -kdm derives adjectives from a few adverbs, e.g., “dipekdm
//[‘déku “ancient times,” from the adverb “dipe “first,” //‘arikdmh pérép“yesterday’s bread,” from the adverb //‘ari “yesterday.”
The suffix -ra is the most “special” of the adjective-deriving suffixes in
that it only is used with one root, i.e., kdira kxdep “‘mature male person,” with
the verb kdf “grow.”
(3) Adjective Derivation
The diminutive suffix -r6 may be added to any adjective, whether simple
or derived, to form another adjective with the meaning: “slightly—” where the
blank is to be filled by the translation of the adjective. For example: /drré tdop
“the slightly difficult road,” *xariré “rather small,” /‘urixaré “slightly dirty.”kaise kd ‘Gop“the very big man.” This may be called the “augmentative” use of kdfse which
compensates for the absence of an augmentative adjective derivational suffix.","[22, 23]"

165INTRODUCTIONOf all the languages in Greenberg’s Khoisan phylum, the language called Nama
Hottentot, or simply Nama, is both the most famous and the most widely
spoken. Nama is spoken by about 30,000 people spread over all but the most
northern part of the territory of South West Africa. The total number of
speakers is evenly divided between two racially and culturally different groups:
(1) the Namas, the people to whom the term ‘‘Hottentot” is usually applied,
who occupy the area to the south of Windhoek, and (2) the negroid Damaras, or
Bergdamas, who occupy the area to the north of Windhoek. Most speakers of
Nama also speak Afrikaans as a second language, and a small number can speak
English, German or Herero (a Bantu language) as well.
Nama belongs to Greenberg’s Central Khoisan group of languages. Within
this group, the language most closely related to it is Korana Hottentot, also
called Korana or Kora, spoken by a very small number of people in a small area
just west of Kimberley in South Africa. Nama and Korana are so similar that
there is some degree of mutual intelligibility. Also in the Central Khoisan group
are some languages spoken in northern Botswana, the most notable of which are
Naron and Hietschware, but these are not nearly so related to Nama as Korana
is.
Previous StudiesThe earliest attempt at the linguistic description of a Khoisan language was
made by the philosopher Leibnitz in 1717. Leibnitz devotes nine pages in his
Colectanea Etymologica (pp. 375-84) to the discussion of a dialect of Cape
Hottentot, a language which is now long extinct but which appears to be closely
related to Nama and Korana Hottentot (Meinhof 1909:33).
It wasduringthelatter half of the nineteenthcentury, however, as theNamaHottentot Grammarterritory which is now called South West Africa was explored and settled by
Europeans, that interest in the description of the Nama language reached its
peak. In the half-century between 1855 and 1905, no fewer than six grammars
of Nama were published: one in English (Tindall 1857), four in German
(Wallmann 1857, Hahn 1870, Seidel 1892, and Planert 1905), and one in French
(Schils 1891). To these may be added the short grammatical sketches in W. H. I.
Bleek’s A Comparative Grammar of South African Languages (1862) and in
Cust’s A Sketch of the Modern Languages of Africa (1862). All of these
descriptions have been surpassed by later work, so that they are mostly of
historical interest. Also in the same period were published four dictionaries:
three in German (Wallman 1854, Olpp 1888, and Kroenlein 1889), and one in
French (Schils 1894). The dictionary by Kroenlein, Wortschatz der Khoi-khoin
(1899), is a work of great thoroughness and remains to this day the best Nama
dictionary. It has been expanded and republished by F. Rust as Nama
Worterbuch (1969).
The first grammatical analysis of Nama which is rigorous enough to merit
our serious attention is contained in Meinhof’s Lehrbuch der Nama-Sprache,
published in 1909. The third part of this work, “‘Wortbildungslehre,” is still a
valuable reference work on Nama morphology, although the first part,
“Lautlehre,” depends too much on the orthographies devised by Kroenlein and
Olpp. The second part, “Grammatik,” contributed by Diedrich Westermann, is
only a slight improvement over previous accounts,
In a series of three articles in the Zeitschrift fiir Eingeborenen-Sprachen
during 1934-5, Dempwolff published an account of Nama phonology and
grammar which corrected some of the more noticeable errors in previous
grammatical descriptions. The reliability of this work is limited, however, by the
fact that Dempwolff used Kroenlein’s translation of the Bible as his primary
source of data for the grammatical analysis. The work is entitled “Einfiihrung in
die Sprache der Nama-Hottentotten.”
The phonological analysis of Beach in his The Phonetics of the Hottentot
Language, which appeared in 1938, represents the undisputed peak of the
linguistic literature on Nama and Korana. Though Beach’s concept of phonemics
is closer to “broad transcription” than to abstract phonemics, his analysis of the
segmental phonemes of Nama can still stand today, despite the advances which
have been made in the theory of phonology since his time. The description
includes an abundance of observational and instrumental data on Nama
phonetics, data which is especially important in connection with the click
sounds which, before Beach, were a phonological puzzle. His analysis of the
tonemes of Nama, however, is only partial in that it does not account for the
tones of particles and suffixes. Beach admits the analysis to be incomplete andIntroaquction~open to reinterpretation (Beach 1938:147). Some recent attempts have been
made to complete Beach’s analysis by Otto von Essen (Essen 1957, 1962, and
1966), but he makes some sweeping simplifications of Nama phonology, such asmaking [t] and [r}] allophones of one phoneme and reducing gliding tones to
simple tones, which do not hold up if tested against a large enough body of data.
The study of Nama grammar has just recently been considerably advanced
by the publication of F. Rust’s Praktische Namagrammatik (1965). Thisgrammaris actually the culmination of a tradition of grammatical studies ofNama maintained by German missionaries in South West Africa. Rust bases hisgrammar on a number of studies which have hitherto not been easily available,
viz., Vedder’s grammatical studies of 1909, with the additions and revisions
made by Brockman and Olpp in 1917. His description also incorporates many of
the advances in Nama grammar made by Meinhof (1909) and Dempwolff
(1934-5). The Praktische Namagrammatik is, both in its content and form of
presentation, a didactic grammar intended for practical instruction in the Nama
language. Though it is an enormous improvement over all previous Nama
grammars and is manifestly written by someone well acquainted with the
language, the grammatical theory according to which it is written is that of
traditional grammar very much influenced by the categories of Latin grammar as
clearly evidenced by Rust’s thoroughgoing use of Latin grammatical terminology. Still, the book is of considerable value, especially on account of its practice
exercises. Phonologically, however, Rust has made no advances; the orthography
is that of Kroenlein and so does not embody any of Beach’s excellent analysis of
Nama phonology. This is unfortunate since some grammatical constructions
involve alterations of tone, and the orthography used by Rust does not indicate
tone at all, in conformity with current orthographic practice in South West
Africa. Rust has also recently published a German-Nama dictionary (Rust 1960).
The Present StudyThe view of Nama phonology and grammar presented here is an entirely
new one, based on an original analysis of fresh data and cast in a modern
theoretical mold. Though the treatment of phonology is admittedly brief in
comparison with the work of Beach, I believe that it answers many of the
questions about tone and vowel length which he was unable to handle with the
theoretical apparatus available to him. The key to the solution is the recognition
of the phenomenon of “sentence stress,” which is essentially the assignment of
dynamic stress and vowel length by syntactic rules operating above the wordlevel (see p. 15).
The major portion of the present study is a broad descriptive survey oftel24Nama Hottentot GrammarNama grammar. The theory of human language which underlies it can only
adequately be conveyed by the description itself, though it might be mentioned
here that it reflects concerns about language structure which have only come
into focus recently with the development of generative-transformational
grammar. This is most obvious in chapters VI through X, but it is true also of the
earlier chapters. Be this as it may, an effort has been made throughout to cling
fast to the data and to resist the impulse to go off onto theoretical tangents
about the deeper levels of language structure which are the delight of theoretical
linguistics but which would be out of place in a descriptive survey such as the
present one is conceived to be. It is hoped that the analysis is incisive enough to
suggest such theoretical questions at numerous points. An effort has also been
made to avoid notational snarls, which would divert attention away from Nama
and toward the problems of grammatical description, by using concrete
examples as much as possible to assist in the presentation of grammatical facts.
To accomplish this end, the description is interlarded with samples of Nama
drawn from the textual data upon which the analysis is based. This also has the
advantage of giving to the grammar something of a didactic effect, gradually
acquainting the reader with some of the lexical substance conveying the
grammatical form, and, hopefully, painting a fuller picture of what the language
is like. It will be seen that the examples are naturally graded by the structure of
the description so that they do not place too much of a burden upon the reader
at any one point.
The analysis is based upon phonological, grammatical, and textual
elicitation from native speakers. The primary source of data for the later stages
of analysis was a set of thirty-four recorded and transcribed texts averaging
about fifteen minutes in length. Some of these were recountings of personal
experiences, others were folktales, and a few were conversations on a particular
topic between two native speakers. What success this investigation may have
achieved is due in no small part to the linguistic insight, enthusiasm, and
devotion to their native language displayed by the two informants who assisted
in the research: Theoben Gurirab from Usakos, and Brian Bassingthwaighte from
Windhoek. Both are Damaras and about thirty years of age. The dialectal
differences between them were found to be very minor, involving only a handful
of lexical items.
In the appendix there is presented a very short text, a folktale, as a sample
of connected discourse. The story was told to me by Theoben Gurirab.","[6, 7, 8, 9]"
"‘Tne IMterrOoRaliveOUlee neeactiC. THE CONTENT INTERROGATIVE
A content interrogative sentence is used by a speaker of the language to request
more information about a particular event or state of affairs. It is a sentence
having an information gap which is marked by an interrogative morpheme, to
which the hearer is expected to reply with a word or phrase which would fill the
information gap. The interrogative morpheme is contained in an interrogative
word, which, in turn, is contained in an interrogative phrase.
The content interrogative sentence is distinguished by the presence either
of an interrogative noun phrase (or NP&) or of an interrogative adverbial. We
may generalize over the two by using the term “interrogative phrase” to cover
both of them. Though the interrogative noun phrase and the interrogative
adverbial have each been discussed in their proper place within previous chaptersit will be convenient to bring all the information together here in one place.
An interrogative noun phrase, which we may abbreviate “INP,” may have
five different forms. It may consist of an interrogative pronoun, composed of
the interrogative pronominal tart “‘who” or taré “what” (6th order class) plus a
pgn suffix, or it may be a noun phrase which contains the interrogative modifier
tarépe “what kind of” (Ist order class), the interrogative number mdatiko (or
hamttké) “how much, how many” (2nd order class), the interrogative
associative INP + ti ‘“‘who’s, what’s” (3rd order class), or the interrogative
demonstrative mda (or ham) “‘which, what” (4th order class). There is also the
special case of an interrogative noun phrase complement, which we may
abbreviate “INP-Comp” consisting of an interrogative noun phrase of any of the
above forms minus the pgn suffix, which may be the predicate of a stative verb
phrase.
An interrogative adverbial may be either an interrogative adverb or an
interrogative post-positional phrase. Of the five interrogative adverbs, four of
them are demonstrative adverbs: madapé “where,” mdati “how, in what manner,”mda/’ti “which way (direction),” and harm’oo “when.” One more interrogative
adverb is mdatikése (or hamtikose) “how much.” An interrogative postpositional phrase consists of an interrogative noun phrase of any type described
in the preceding paragraph plus a post-position (INP + PP). There are also two
contracted forms of this construction: taréxa “by what,” a contraction of taré’i
xaa, and taré!’éroma “why, because of what,” a contraction of taré’i !’aréma.
The principal syntactic mle of the content interrogative is that an
interrogative phrase must be initialized if it is not the subject NPa, which is
already initial. This rule applies within interrogative sentences, as we shall see
when we deal with the embedding of interrogative sentences. In the followingsentence, the interrogative phrase is the subject NPa: tari’e //an’é ké #'uiu?
“Who (indef., sing.) ate (ké #’ui) some meat (//an’é)?” Note the tone on -’e in142Nama Hottentot Grammartart’e. In the preceding example, the indefinite suffix -7 (-7 + -a@ =~-é) was used
because the gender of the subject was unknown, but in the following sentence
the subject is known to be masculine singular: taripa //an’é ké #2 “Who
(masc., sing.) ate the meat?” The next example has an interrogative direct objectNP& obligatorily initialized: taré’ep //’tipa ké #’u uu? “What (taré’e) did he ¢p ...","[77, 78]"
"The fact that a verb phrase cannot have both present tense and punctual
aspect is amenable to semantic explanation. Since the punctual aspect is used to
describe an event as happening at a discrete point in time, a sentence whose verb
phrase had present tense as well would describe an event whose happening isThe Vero Phrase65exactly coterminous with the point in time at which the sentence is uttered. The
unacceptablesentence*//fipke ! uu.wouldmean“Hegoes.”andthattheevent of “his going’ both begins and ends as the sentence is pronounced, an
extremely unlikely occurrence. It might be noted that the English gloss “He
goes.” would not be used to describe a present event either. We can conclude
that the meanings of present tense and punctual aspect are semantically
incompatible.
Punctual aspect will be seen to contrast with imperfective aspect, in
that the event depicted by the sentence in which it occurs is complete, and with
the perfective aspect, in that event described by the sentence in which it occurs
is contemporary with the time indicated by the tense.
b. Imperfective Aspect. Imperfective aspect may occur with all tenses. A
sentence whose verb phrase has this aspect describes an event as being in progress
at the time indicated by the tense, and, therefore, incomplete. Verb phrases withimperfective aspect have the following structure with the different tenses:
kéré
koro(NP&)+ (NP&)+ 4 ra-tain the remote past
in the recent past+ V[tact]in the presentnil rain the futurekarain the indefiniteThe morpheme indicating imperfective aspect is a suffix after the tense
morphemes ké “‘remote past,” kO “recent past,” and ka “indefinite. It is a
particle with @ ‘“‘present,” and nii “future,” the tense morphemes which are
anomalous in their phonological structure. When a particle, the form is ra, but
when a suffix, the vowel and tone of the imperfective tense morpheme is
determined by absolute vowel harmony with the vowel of the preceding mora,
viz., that of the tense morpheme, resulting in -ré after ké, -r6 after ko, and -ra
after ka. One of the informants reports having heard the form niri for
imperfective future from speakers of other dialects of Nama, but such a form
does not exist in the Damara dialect under examination here. (See p. 17.)
With present tense, the imperfective morpheme has two allomorphs; ra and
ta, which participate in sandhi alternation. The allomorph ta occurs when the
preceding word ends in a consonant (this consonant can only be /p/, /s/, /ts/,
/m/, or /n/ in native Nama words), while the allomorph ra occurs when the
preceding word ends in a vowel, which is usually the case. For example: sadts ke
ra !uu. “You (masc. sing.) are going., but mdapdts ta Niu? “Where are you
going?” For more examples, see p. 17. On occasion this rule is violated after /m/,Nama66Hottentot Grammare.g., #homikxm ra !xdisa “that we are lying.” This violation of the rule is fairly
frequent, but the informants always wanted to correct ra to ta during the
transcription of texts.
The incomplete event which a sentence having imperfective aspect
describes may be either: (a) an event in progress, in which case the sentence
would be translated with the “progressive aspect’ in English, or (b) an habitual
event, in which case the sentence would be translated with the English “‘used to”
aspect in the past tenses, and the English “‘simple present”’ and “future” in the
other tenses. Cases (a) and (b) are not distinguished in the aspect system of
Nama. Here are some examples: //’fip ke !x66’omsa xuu kéré #’0d. “He was
getting out of jail.”; kxden ke ‘dutusa kéré sii. “The people used to send a car.”;I[tis ke koro //nae. “She was just (recently) singing.”; tiita ke //atusa xut ra
“I am'x6é.running away from home.”; tiita ke sadtsa nii ra sdd. “1 will befollowing you (masc. sing.).”; Ahomikxmkara ’oo “if we (masc.du.) werelying,”’ with the verb #homi “‘lie.”’
The imperfective aspect contrasts with both the punctual aspect and the
perfective aspect in that the event described by the sentence in which it occurs is
incomplete.
c. Perfective Aspect. Perfective aspect may occur with all tenses. A
sentence whose verb phrase has this aspect describes an event as having been
completed before the time depicted by the tense morpheme, and resulting in a
“state of affairs” obtaining at the time depicted by the tense morpheme. Verb
phrases with perfective aspect have the following structures with the different
tenses:ihe Verd Phrase

pronominal and pgn suffix, e.g., tiiréta “little me,” sadrdts “little you(masc., sing.),”’ //’firép “little him.”
Two of the second person pronouns have special uses as forms of address.
The second person common plural pronoun sadttu may be used as a “polite”
form when addressing a person of either sex who is entitled to a high degree of
respect from the speaker. The second person masculine plural pronoun sadko
may be used by a male speaker when addressing a male equal with whom the
speaker has an especially close personal relationship; this use of sadko may be
called the “familiar” second person masculine singular pronoun; sadts, however,
may always be used in its stead.
B. THE APPOSITIVE NOUN PHRASE
An appositive noun phrase consists of two or more adjacent simple noun phrases
all of which have the same pgn suffix since they all have the same referent. No
pronominals occur in the second and later simple noun phrases of an appositive
construction, even if the pgn suffix indicates first or second person. Depending
on whether or not there is a noun root present in the second or later simple
noun phrase, an appositive noun phrase may be of two types: (1) without nounroot deletion, and (2) with noun root deletion.
I.",[29]
"TenseThe Nama language distinguishes five tenses, four of which are each
conveyed by a specific tense morpheme, and one of which is conveyed by the
absence of a tense morpheme. The tenses and morphemes are:
remote past
recent past
present
future
indefiniteké
ko
d
nit
ka‘Tne Verb05Fhrasethough it was months before that the year ‘“‘went out,” not just the day before.
This example and others like it clearly indicate that the recent past marked by
ko and the remote past marked by ké are relative concepts, and it is up to the
judgement of the speaker which events he wants to describe as “recent” and
which as “remote.” In the example, nee kO #’0d kurip, the recent past is used
because the event described is the most recent case of a year coming to
termination. Actually, the best way to translate the kd tense in Nama is with the
just tense in English, e.g., /[’tip ke ko hiu. “He just went.,” as opposed to //’iip
kekéhiu.",[38]
"Weshouldnot makethemistake, however, of thinking that nee, //nda, and ndi represent merely three
different degrees of proximity; if three individuals are to be distinguished, a
speaker will say nee kxdep tsii nd kxdep tsti navi kxdep with an especially
emphatic stress on the last mdi which raises both its tones slightly.
Leaving the context of an immediate speech situation, we can see how the
meanings of the three demonstratives, as just established, can be used in a
metaphorical sense in the context of a discourse, such as a story. In one folktale,
nee is used preceding nouns which denote previously mentioned characters who
are present during a specific scene in the story, //naa@ is used preceding those
which denote previously mentioned characters or things which are not present
during that specific scene, and ndu only occurs before a noun when onemostrecentlymentionedcharacter,andndbeforethatwhichdenotesacharacter mentioned yet earlier.
It is only within the context of a discourse that we can understand the
meanings of our remaining two demonstratives, //xad and /nit. The gloss, “thesame,” given above for //xad quite accurately conveys its meaning. It is usedpreceding a noun to emphasize that the referent of that noun is exactly the same
as the referent of a noun which has occurred in a closely preceding sentence. The
gloss, “some,” for /nii, however, is not quite so good, since we might remember
that “‘some” has been used earlier as the gloss for the indefinite gender and the
two do not mean the same thing. Let us contrast the two. The indefinite gender
suffix is added to a noun when the speaker does not know what individual
person or thing the referent of the noun denotes, or just does not know its
name, e.g., kxde’l “some person or other,” #xart /’daré7 “some little town or
other.”” The demonstrative /nit is used when the speaker does not expect his
hearer to know what individual person or thing the referent of the noun which
follows it denotes, e.g., /nit kxdep “some male person,” or better, ‘a certain
male person,” when it is understood “I know who he is but I don’t expect youto.”; /nit #xari V’darés “a certain little town,” with the same understanding. It iscertainly possible to have both the indefinite gender suffix added to the noun
and the demonstrative /nit preceding it, in which case both their meanings are
present, e.g., /nii kxde’i “some person or other,” with the understafiding “I
don’t expect you to know him/her either.” As might be expected if one thinks
about it, where we find an indefinite gender suffix on the noun, there is usually
also a [nit somewhere preceding it.
In stories, the demonstrative /ni7 is a favorite device for introducing new
characters as the subject of a sentence. (They may be introduced without it as
objects of a sentence.) It signals the introduction of a new character because, by
indicating that the hearer should not know who the character is, it implies that
the character has not yet been mentioned, whether that “character” be a person
or a thing. Once the character is introduced though, it is known for the purposes
of the narration, and one of the other demonstratives may be used.
There is one demonstrative construction in the language which is formed
with the demonstrative and is very much the same in meaning as /n7i alone. It
consists of /nii followed by the verb root haa “‘to exist, to be (in a place).”’ This
unique construction with haa merely emphasizes an assumption which is always
present when /nii, or any other demonstrative for that matter, is used. That
assumption is that the noun which follows denotes something which exists. For
example, /nii haa kxdep and /nii kxSep both mean the same thing, namely, ‘“‘aNama40Hottentot Grammarcertain male person.” But the first phrase draws more attention to the noun and
implies, when it is being used to introduce a new character in a story, that the
referent of the noun will now play an important part in the story. Often, when
several characters are being introduced, this demonstrative construction alsocontains the manner adverb /|xadpa * ‘again.” Thus we may have: /nfi haa
//xadpé kxoep “‘a certain other man,” or /nii //xadpd hada kxdep, or even /nit
//xadpé kxdep with the same meaning.

The term “universal” covers only three words all of which are very similar in
form and meaning. They are: hOd, hOdrd, and hOdraka and they all mean roughly41The Noun Phrasethe gender-number suffix, and the preceding derivational affix if there is one, are
suffixed to the next remaining constituent. For example: kd? ‘dop “the big man”

!nondti “‘the three of them (fem.)”; sd@ ’Tip “your father” becomes sddp ‘“‘yours(masc.)”; #niu kx6en ti kopaku “the languages of the black people” becomes
#nuu kxoen tiku “those (masc.) of the black people”; hdd kxoen “all the

one (masc.)”; //naasiita ti /hooku “those male friends of ours” becomes //nda
sitta tiku “those ones (masc.) of ours.”
The condition of redundancy under which this noun root deletion occurs
is difficult to define precisely. When this phenomenon occurs in a text, the root
which is deleted is always one which has occurred recently either in the same
sentence or in a closely preceding sentence. The most frequent use of this
deletion is in the appositive noun phrase which will be described presently.

substituted for hdd in these examples with little change in the meanings. Note
that, although the English translation changes according to the number conveyed
by the suffix on the noun, the Nama meaning is the same in all three examples.","[26, 27]"

person pronominals, tii, sii, and sad, are obligatorily present, and the third-m~-im?",[28]
"Thestructuresemantic difference between remote (ké) and recent (ko) past isdifficult to define precisely. One informant says he would use kd “recent past”
in describing an event which happened today or yesterday, e.g., //’tip ke ko !iu.
“He went.,” and ké “remote past” in describing an event which happened before
yesterday, e.g., //’tip ke ké !ui. “He went.” An examination of the use of these
two past tenses in narrative material shows that, in the great majorityof cases,this rule is not contradicted. In fact, most uses of KO are in connection with
events occurring earlier in the same day. There are enough cases that contradict
it, however, to show that speakers of Nama follow no such definite rule in
deciding whether an event is recent enough to be described with the recent past
ko, For example, nee ko #’od kurtp “this past year,” is a relativization which
means literally “this year that went out.” Here the recent past KO is used evenbuttheindefinite, in whichcasethecombinationof kaand‘ooin the sameclause results in the translation “if.” It is possible for the first clause to be
uttered alone, e.g., /uiup ka ’oo. which means “If he’d only go!” Such an
utterance is understood as being part of a larger sentence, the second part of
which has been deleted; it is elliptical.
The conditional sentence given above can be seen merely to be a case of
embedding, and it should be noted that the indefinite tense marker ka occurs in
the embedded sentence (subordinate clause). The use of this tense is not
restricted to “‘conditional” sentences like the one above; it may be used in a
variety of other types of embedded sentences when the speaker chooses to leave
the tense indefinite. If the kad tense is to be compared with analogous phenomena
in other languages, one will see that the closest thing to it is usually termed
“subjunctive mood.”",[38]
"IneVeroFnhraseOfWhen a stative verb phrase has one of the past tenses and an NP-Comp, the
tense morpheme may be shifted to the position immediately following the
predicate and, therefore, before the past tense copula’i/. The previous example
sentence sadts ke ké ‘do ‘it. “You were a man.” would be indistinguishable inmeaning from sadts ke “do ké ‘ii. When the NP-Comp is rather long, this tense
movement is very likely. Thus, sadts ke siita hodta ti Aae#’Ut”'ao ké “it. “Youwere leader of all of us (pl., com., excl.).” would be more likely than sadts ke ké
sitta hodta ti #Aie-#’tiiao ii. In fact, the latter sentenceis rather awkward.
(1) The Adjective as Noun Phrase Complement
The case of a NP-Comp which consists only of an adjective deserves to be
singled out for special attention for its divergent syntactic properties. First of all,
we might ask why an adjective NP-Comp, as in“dop ke ‘a kai. “The man is big.,”
is different from a stative verb, as in ’dop ke ‘a #’an. “The man knows.” which
we might be tempted to translate more literally as “The man is knowledgeable.’
Thedifference is, of course, that the stative verb may not occur in the first orderclass of the noun phrase so that kdf ‘dop “the big man” is acceptable while #’an
Yéop is not (though the relativization #’4% ‘a ‘dop “the man who knows” is
acceptable).
An adjective as NP-Comp may undergo the same V-NP Derivation as an
active verb (p. 77) provided that the applicative suffix -pa is affixed to theadjective. In the sentence //nda ‘utp ke ké lornpate ‘it. “That life was difficultfor me.,” the NP-Comp consists of the adjective /6m “difficult” followed by the
applicative suffix -pa “for,” followed in turn by the object suffix -te ° ‘me.” The
last suffix may even be the passive suffix -é as in the sentence sitke ke ||nda
V4das xaa ké Iniwupahé ’it. which must be translated “That town was too far for
> but is literally “We (sifke) were (ké... if) too far-ed for (/nuupahe
composed of Inti “far,” applicative -pa, and passive -hé) by that town (//naa!das xaa).”
Something about the “comparison of adjectives” in Nama should be said
at this point, though to recognize this as a topic at all is to think comparatively
as opposed to descriptively ; few languages have a neat set of derivational suffixes
like -er and -est in English which makes the “comparison of adjectives” one
grammatical system. In Nama, this topic reduces to the meaning of one
post-position xaa which usually can be glossed “by” (p. 102). Here is a sequence
of sentences: ’dop ke ’a kat. “The man is big.”; *dop ke ‘Grip xaa ‘a kai. “The
man is bigger than the dog.” or, more literally, ““The man is big by the dog.’
*dop ke hodn xaa ’a kéi. “The man is biggest.” or, more literally, “The man is
bigger by all of them.” The post-positional phrases “drip xaa “by the dog” and
hod xaa “by all of them” belong to the Adverbial constituent of the predicate
phrase.",[50]
"To perform the three communicative functions of giving information, requesting
information, and commanding, Nama has three types of sentence: declarative,
interrogative, and imperative. Each of these types has a characteristic structure
which distinguishes it from the other two types. The declarative sentence is the
most frequently used and elaborated type and exemplifies most clearly the basic
structure underlying all sentences; the interrogative and imperative sentences
should be considered special modifications of the syntactic structure exemplified
in the declarative. The primary function of language is to convey information
and the declarative sentence is the device by which this function is most plainly
carried out. Requesting information and giving commands are secondary
functions which require special sentence structures derived from that of the
declarative. An interrogative sentence is a declarative sentence with an
information gap which is marked in the sentence by an interrogative morpheme.
An imperative sentence is a declarative sentence which dispenses with a
“subject,” and whose imperative function is marked by an imperative particle at
the end of the sentence.
For the exposition of the structural principles which underlie all Nama
sentences, it will be best to restrict ourselves for the time being to the declarative
sentence, and save the other types for later chapters. We will devote our
attention, in turn, to its structure, intonation, and to one of its constituents, thepredicate phrase.
A.",[33]
"The ConsonantsAmong the consonant phonemes, there is a clear division into two groups
according to the mechanism used to produce the sounds: (a) the non-clicka. The Non-Click Consonants. The system of non-click consonants is very
uncomplicated. The following system of thirteen consonants is the complete
non-click system for native Nama words, i.e., all words which have not recently
been borrowed from Afrikaans, German, or English. To these may be added the
phonemes /f/, /v/, /j/, and /l/ to cover the most common borrowed words.
pt
oyefocusaccording to which these units combine to form morphemes, and the
phonological effects of one morpheme upon another. Under this scheme, the
allophony of phonemes belongs properly under the heading of “morpheme
structure,” since the environments conditioning the allophones of the Nama
phonemes are internal to the morpheme, the most important of these
environments being the boundaries of the morpheme itself.
A topic of phonological relevance which will not be discussed in this
section is the question of sentence intonation. The intonations of declarative,
interrogative, and imperative-hortative sentences will be presented later with the
structural descriptions of these types of sentences (pp. 55, 140, 145). For now,
the intonation phonemes may be listed as: /./ “very falling,” /?/ “slightly
falling,” and /!/ “level.” These intonation phonemes affect the whole sentence
from beginning to end.consonants which use the breath-stream mechanism, and (b) the clicks which usethe linguo-palatal suction mechanism, as well as the breath-stream mechanism, to
produce distinctive sounds.anbe extended to cover all of the morphemes in the language. The following are
examples of the three different orthographies: the verb root meaning “go away”
was written by Kroenlein as bé with no indication of tone; it was simplified by
Beach to -pe with his tonal contour -V; and it is phonemicized in the present
description as péé with a low tone on the first vowel and a high tone on the
second.
The phonology of Nama is best presented in three stages: the phonemes,
morpheme structure, and morphophonemics. This tripartite scheme allows us to/PhonologyctNama Hottentot Grammar6[t/, /ts/, /s/, /n/, and /r/ are apico-alveolar. /r/ represents an alveolar flap [r] . The
stop series is voiceless unaspirated; /’/ is the glottal stop. The affricates are
written with the digraphs /ts/ and /kx/ in conformity with previous orthographic
systems. The tongue articulation in the latter two consonants is rather lax, and
their release is often followed by slight glottal friction, e.g., [tsh] and [kxh].
Nasalization is included in the table for the distributional reasons
mentioned above. It actually has no point of articulation but is realized on
adjacent vowels.
b. The Clicks. Nama has a completely symmetrical system of twenty
clicks. Each click has two parts termed by Beach the “influx” and the “efflux.”
Each click is symbolized digraphically, the first symbol representing the influx
and the second the efflux. The total of twenty results from the combination of
four influxes with five effluxes.
The mechanism by which these sounds are produced requires considerable
explanation, since the click mechanism of sound production occurs nowhere
outside of the Khoisan languages and the few Bantu languages which have taken
over some clicks in words which they borrowed from the Khoisan languages. The
production of click sounds is rather a long and complicated affair compared to
the production of non-click consonants, but it is possible to produce quite a
number of distinct sounds by this mechanism: twenty in Nama Hottentot and
twenty-four in Korana Hottentot. The mechanism may be a difficult one, but it
produces a high yield in phonemic distinctions. I have divided the following
description of the click mechanism into four stages: (1) Onset, (2) Suction, (3)
Influx, and (4) Efflux. No acoustic effect is produced until stages (3) and (4).",[10]
"Inallencounteredof KOcasesin text material,thetranslation with just was perfectly acceptable, though it did convey just a bit too
much recency. Such a translation brings out clearly the degree to which the two
tenses are relative to one another since no one would attempt to put a time limit
on the recency of an event which could be described with the just tense in
English.
Another tense which requires elucidation is the “indefinite” tense marked
by ka, since few languages distinguish such a tense, though they may get
across the same idea with different means. A sentence whose verb phrase
contains an indefinite tense marker describes an event whose time of occurrence
is indefinite, and, hence, the occurrenceof the event itself is indefinite. Almostall instances of ka occur within “conditional” sentences. For example: /uiup ka
‘00, oota ke nti hu. “If he should go, I will go,” or more freely, “If he goes, I
will go.” Morpheme-by-morpheme, the sentence translates:hiu-pka00,00-ta«keont.goheind.whenthenIDecfut.goThe clause relator ’o0 as in /uup ka ’oo translates as “when” with all other tenses
Note that the future tense morpheme nti belongs to the morpheme
class ‘‘Roots,”’ while the others are “Particles.”",[38]
"The TonesThere are three phonemic register (as opposed to contour) tones: high
indicated by an acute accent, /V/ or [N/; middle indicated by no accent mark,
[V/ or /N/; and low indicated by a grave accent, /V/ or /N/. These tones may be
carried by a vowel or a morpheme-final nasal, as will be explained when
morpheme structure is described. The tones, of course, represent relative pitches
and these relative pitches are superimposed upon the intonation contour of the
sentence. For example, in a declarative sentence there is a steadily falling
intonation contour from the beginning to the end of the sentence. This falling in
absolute pitch affects all of the tones so that the relative pitch intervals between
themare unaffected. As a convenient point of reference, we may say that, at the1lPhonologybeginning of a declarative sentence, a high tone is pronounced at the top of the
comfortable speaking register, and, at the end of a declarative sentence, a low
tone is pronounced at the bottom of the speaking register.
When the high tone occurs on the high vowels, /i/ and /G/, or on a
morpheme-final nasal, /m/ and /n/, it is pronounced phonetically higher than
when it is carried by any of the other vowels, /é/, /4/, and /6/.
B. MORPHEMESTRUCTUREThe combination of phonemes to form morphemes is highly restricted in Nama,
i.e., there is a very limited number of canonical forms which a morpheme may
have and only certain specific consonants and vowels may fill certain positions
within these canonical forms. For this reason, recent loan words from Afrikaans,
English, or German are easily identifiable because they almost always violate the
morpheme structure rules which apply unfailingly to all native Nama words. The
description which follows excludes all such recent borrowings since the words
are formed according to morpheme structure rules which are foreign to Nama.
Borrowingsarealwaysadaptedtoacertainextent,however,inthatNamaphonemes are substituted for the foreign ones. For example, the distinction
between voiced and voiceless stops is always eliminated in the process of
borrowing, and strong stress becomes high tone, medium stress becomes middle
tone, and weak stress becomes low tone. There is also usually a substitution of
the Nama phoneme /ts/ for the foreign sounds [t] and [d2Z], and consonant
clusters are simplified by the elimination of one of the consonant sounds. The
phonemes /f/, /v/, /j/, and /1/ clearly came into the language through such
borrowings from European languages; they occur only in such borrowed words.
The degree to which borrowed words are adapted depends on the degree of
bilingualism of the speaker; an extremely bilingual speaker may bring words
from Afrikaans into his Nama discourse with essentially no change at all. The
question of recent borrowings is an interesting one, but it is too complicated a
problem to concern us here.
The first unit of phonological structure above the phoneme is the mora,
which is a unit of quantity. We cannot speak of “syllables” except in
morphemes of only a few canonical forms, CVCV, CV, CN, so that the
“syllable” is useless as a generally applicable level of structure. A mora consists
of either a vowel or a morpheme-final nasal, plus the consonant which
immediately precedes it, if there is one. If the vowel or morpheme-final nasal is
followed by a word-final /p/, /s/, or /ts/, this also belongs to the mora. Here are a
few typical words divided into morae: ké-mdp “the bull,” ku-u-n “sheep(common, plural),” in this word -/ is a morpheme, /’a-dp “the snake (masc.),”12morpheme-final

constructions is an interesting problem, but one which we can only briefly go
into here though it would be illuminating for a deeper study of Nama syntax.
The structure of the NP-Comp may be described by the following diagram:
(Associative)+ (Noun Stem)+ (Number) + (Adjective)All constituents have been made optional since neither is more obligatory than
any other. If none of them is present, we simply would have a case of the absence
of the predicate (see p. 88). The order is fixed just as it is in the noun phrase
construction. For comparison, the structure of the noun phrase is repeated
below:(y+nal6saltrative)“ative543er* ier21)+NounAn examination of the two structures reveals three differences between the
NP-Comp construction and the NP: (a) the lack of order classes 4, 5, and 6, (b)

stem.",[49]
"On67the basis of structure,however,hdais a stative auxilliary verb, sothat the presence of the past copula with the past tenses is not surprising since
such is the case with all stative verbs. We shall come back to this question later.
The reduplication of haz with the future cannot be explained on this basis,
though, so it will just have to be considered an irregularity in the paradigm. It is
interesting to note regarding the future perfect construction that the informants
considered this construction to be “too complicated,” and that a sentence
having it can always be recast so that is simpler and clearer. It can be deduced
from this that the construction with nii... hda hda occupies a rather marginal
position in the grammar of Nama.
There is a phenomenon of the stative verb phrase which also applies to
active verb phrases with perfective aspect. This phenomenon is ‘‘tense
movement” and consists of a reversal in the order of tense and verb with no
change in the meaning. An active verb phrase with perfective aspect and tense
movement would have the structure below:
(NPa) + (NPa) + V[+act]+ Te + PerfIn the case of the future perfect, the tense may also be moved after “Perf”
resulting in: Ada haa nti. For the other tenses the forms would be: ké hda ‘it
with the remote past, kO haa ’ii with the recent past, kd haa with the indefinite.
The present is the same since “Te” is ¢.
Here are some examples of sentences with perfective aspect: kxden ke ké#'di hda ’it. “The people had thought.”; //’fip keseetdfrikapd xwt kd /xit haa‘it. “He had just come from South Africa.”; //iip ke /’aésn haa. “He has got

hda ‘ii
hda itké
ko(NPa) + (NPA) + 2 @$ + V{tact]+< hadaremote past
recent past(masc. pl.) had waited there,” where //ndapd means “there.”
There are a handful of active verbs in Nama which are almost always foundpresentwith perfective aspect. The most common ones are: / ‘aa “get hungry,” //da “‘get
thirsty,” //aa “get satisfied,’ /‘aésn “get sick” (actually, this verb has the
reflexive suffix -sn, so it would be literally “sicken oneself”), /xuu “get rich.” For
example, tiita ke !’da haa. “I have gotten hungry.” should really best benithda hdafuturekahdaindefiniteThe perfective aspect can be seen to be morphemically complex with three
tenses: remote past, recent past, and future. With all tenses, the perfective aspectcontains haa which elsewhere is a stative verb meaning “to exist” or “to be (in a
place)’ (see pp. 84, 94). With both past tenses, haz is followed by it, the past
allomorph of the copula (see p. 83). With the future tense, haa is reduplicated.
There is a reason for this complexity. Functionally, the construction realizing
the symbol ‘‘Perf” with each tense is an instance of a single category, “perfective
aspect,’ which contrasts with the two other aspects in a three-member aspecttranslated “I am hungry.” Similarly, titta ke //da haa. “I have gotten thirsty.”
should be translated “I am thirsty.”
There are two active verbs which undergo morphophonemic changes when
they occur before haa. These are the “position verbs” maa “‘stand up,” and
#nuu “sit down.” The change is:
t#nutu haa becomes #nva
mda haa becomes maa68Nama Hottentot GrammarThis happens in all tenses. For example: titta ke maa. “I have stood up.” or “Iam standing.” Contrast this with: tifta ke ra maa. “I am (in the process of)
standing up.” The same change may occur with the third “position verb” //oé
“lie down” so that //6é hada becomes //de, but this is optional while the changes
are obligatory for the other two position verbs.
The perfective aspect contrasts with the imperfective aspect in that the
event described by the sentence in which it occurs is complete, and with the
punctual aspect in that the event described was completed previous to the time
depicted by the tense morpheme.
3.","[40, 41]"
"54.
There is one more syntactic difference distinguishing the interrogative
sentence and that is the presence of an interrogative noun phrase or adverbial in
the case of the content interrogative which is to be explained presently.
B. INTONATION
There are two intonational differences betwen the interrogative and the
declarative sentence. One of these is a morphemically restricted tone perturbation, and the other is a pattern of general sentence intonation.
In an interrogative sentence, when an NPa occurs before the constituent
“Int” (@ or kxa) either as the subject NPa or an initialized direct or indirect
object NPa, the tone of the subordinative suffix -@ is changed from low to
middle. Thus, NPa becomes NPa, and we will write it as such in our transcription since it is clearly a case of change from one toneme to another.
The general sentence intonation of the interrogative sentence differs from
the declarative in that the pitch of the voice does not decline nearly so much
from the beginning to the end of the sentence. It is, in fact, nearly level
throughout. Neither is there as much lowering of the tone of the final mora of
the sentence, so that a verb at the end of an interrogative sentence has its tone
sequence almost intact. Sometimes it is only this general sentence intonation
which tells us that a particular sentence is interrogative, so we will indicate this
nearly level intonation by the symbol “?” placed at the end of the sentence.
Usually, though, one of the several syntactic and intonational features
mentioned above also marks a sentence as being interrogative.",[77]
"TheV-NP Derivational SuffixesTheouter layer of derivational suffixes on the verb, i.e., those suffixed tothe verb stem, have meanings which alter the relationship between the verb and
the noun phrases in the sentence. Hence, these suffixes are called ““V-NP
derivational suffixes.” Their relationship to the verb stem is described in the
following formula:Verb Stem[O NP] + (-’%2)[1 NP]or [2 NP]+ (-pa)
(-pa)
+ (Patient
i
i
Suffix)The suffix -’%@ is the accompanitive suffix. The suffix -pa is the applicative
suffix.
The item “Patient Suffix” in the formula represents a large system of
suffixes which includes the object suffixes, the ‘passive suffix, the reflexive
suffix, and the reciprocal suffix. The formula states that the accompanitive
suffix -a may only occur after an intransitive verb stem. There is another
restriction not depicted above: the patient suffixes may not occur directly after
an intransitive verb stem. The implications of these restrictions will be explained
when each suffix is discussed.
One syntactic characteristic that all of these suffixes have in common is
that they change the subcategorization of the verb, i.e., they alter the number of
noun phrases which may be present in the verb phrase.
We shall start with the suffix closest to the verb stem and work our way
outward.
a. -’t “Accompanitive”. When the accompanitive suffix -’ is added to an
intransitive verb stem, the verb which results is transitive. Since the meanings ofNama Hottentot Grammar78most intransitive verbs involve motion of one sort or another, the presence of -’u
in the verb and an NPA in the verb phrase has the meaning “the referent of the
NPa accompanies the ‘subject? NP in the movement conveyed by the verb stem,
usually under the agency of the ‘subject’ NP.” To translate a Nama verb with -z
into English, we must often use an entirely different English verb than that used
to translate the same Nama verb stem without -. We shall best understand this
suffix by a comparison of sentences differing from each other only by thepresence of -% on the verb and an “object”? NPa: #’odkunis ke ké !uiu. “The
plane went.” to be compared with #’odkunis ke kxoena ké !uiur’u. “The plane
took the people.”; /apda!namku ke kéré Inari. “The policemen were travelling.”to be compared with /’dpa!namku ke titi /hooka kéré !nari’u. “The policemen
were transporting my friends.”’; tifta ke ra /xii. “I am coming.” as compared
aw as
Be
with tiita ke #uuna ra /xit’a. “1 am bringing food.” ""dop ke kéré !xaru. “The
man was passing.” to be compared with gop ke //’fip ti /’apésa keré !xartt.
“The man was carrying out his plan.”
The accompanitive suffix -% very probably has an etymological relationship to the simple verb root ’#u “take,” since the similarity in form and meaning
is very close. In fact, it is tempting to analyze these verbs with -’u as, rather,
compound verb roots whose second member is 7s. Thus, instead of /uu’u
“take,” we would write */ui-’i “take.’ Though such compounds are the
probable etymological source of -’%, the short length with which this morpheme
is pronounced, as well as the freedom of its combination with intransitive verb
stems, rules out its analysis as part of a compound, and supports its analysis as a
V-NP derivational suffix.b. -pa “‘Applicative’’”. The applicative suffix -pa, unlike -@, may be added
to anyverbstem,whetherintransitive, transitive,or ditransitive. When-pa isadded to a verb stem, it is always accompanied by an added “indirect object”
NPa at the beginning of the verb phrase. Thus, it increases the number of noun
phrases with which the verb stem may co-occur by one, and this NP is always
the first NP4 of the verb phrase. The meaning of -pa can usually be rendered:
“to—,” “for—,” ‘on behalf of—,”’ where the blank is to be filled by the gloss of
the extra NPA. Let us compare some sentences with and without this suffix on
the verb and an extra NPA: //’fip ke ko mii . . . “He just said . ..” as compared
with //fip ke tiita ko miipa... “He just told me. .,” or, more literally, “He
just said to me...’; nee kxdep ke xuu’é ké tit. “This person (masc.) did
something.,” as compared with nee kxdep ke tiita xuu’é ké titpa. ‘This person
(masc.) did something for me.”; //’fis ke xuuna nit !omlom. “She will make
things difficult (/677).” as compared with //tfis ke //’fipa xuuna nit !6m!ompa.
“She will make things difficult for him.’ When the verb stem is ditransitive, theNeTYVero Fiitdaseaddition of -pa to the verb stem may result in a verb which is “tritransitive.”
Here is such a sentence using the ditransitive verb stem mda “give,” and with
English proper names for clarity: pili ke jona mariasa #xanisa ké mdapa. “Billgave Mary the letter for John.” It can be seen here that the order of the NP4’s in
the verb phrase is significant, identifying the various indirect and direct objects.
Actually, a certain amount of scrambling of these NPa’s is permitted, as long as
some semantic features of the noun phrases themselves can allow the hearer to
sort out the NPa’s. Thus, the last example might as well have the following
forms: pili ke jond #xanisa mariasa ké maapa. pili ke #xanisa jona martasa ké
maapa. The inanimacy of #xants ‘‘the letter” makes it obviously the direct
object so that its ordering in the scheme is redundant and may be relaxed. If the
order of the proper names is changed, however, the meaning of the sentence is
changed. More will be said about the ordering of sentence components later.
c.","[45, 46]"
"There are two simple associative morphemes:tit “my (first person masculine or feminine singular),” and sdd “your (second
person masculine or feminine singular).” These forms mean that the referent of
the noun which ends the noun phrase is possessed by, or related to the speaker,
with ti7, or the person spoken to, with sdd, making no distinctions about gender
in either case. For example: tii ’oms ‘‘my house (either by possessing it or living
in it),” sda ‘oms “your (sing.) house,” tii /‘apés “my decision,” tit /nond ‘tixd‘Gai i “my three beautiful daughters,” sdd madmds “your (sing.) mother,” tif /hoop
“my male friend.”",[25]
"There is a slight difference in meaning between hdd, on the one hand, and
hodraéor hddrdka,ontheotherin that the latter forms are more“emphatic,”that is, they are used to emphasize the fact that a totality of persons or things is
being talked about; the form hdd has no such emphatic meaning. The way this
meaning difference often shows up in a text is that the first mention of a totality
will involve hodrdka, while any later reference to the same totality will involve
hod. Thus, in one text, the first mention of “all the black people” is hodraka#ntu kxden, while later the same people are referred to as hod #nuu kxoen or
#nuu kxoeh hodh “the black people, all of them.” The second is an appositive
noun phrase.
7. Deletion of the Noun RootBefore we discuss the sixth and last order class of the simple noun phrase,
it will be convenient first to mention the option of noun root deletion, an
option which is frequently taken advantage of in the language.
Under the condition that it is highly redundant, i.e., predictable from the
context, a noun root may be deleted from the simple noun phrase, in which caseThe sixth order class of the noun phrase may be represented by one of
four possible pronominal roots each of which indicates the grammatical category
of person.
Whether the occurrence of a pronominal root is obligatory or
optional is dependent on a complicated set of conditions which will be discussed
in its place.
It will be remembered that, at the beginning of this chapter, the statement
was made that ‘‘all noun phrases... end in a word which is inflected for gender,
number, and person.” However, in the ensuing discussion, no mention was again
made of the category “‘person.” This neglect was an intentional device to
simplify the presentation by putting off the discussion of person until the
pronominal was reached in our progression through the order classes of the noun
phrase. We are now in a position to correct this distortion and treat the matter
fully. In truth, all the noun phrases heretofore exemplified have been inflected
for person; they have been inflected for the third person. The gender-number
suffixes in the table near the beginning of the chapter are, in truth,
person-gender-number suffixes of the third person. From here forward, the term
“person-gender-number suffix” will be abbreviated to “pgn suffix.”
The indication of person in Nama is a bipartite affair. Both the obligatory
pgn suffix on the noun and the pronominal of the sixth order class indicate
person. In any one noun phrase, the pronominal and pgn suffix indicate the
same person (first, second, or third) except in the first person non-singular (dual
or plural) inclusive.",[27]
"The clause relator in this case is the pgn suffix -/ “third person plural common”
which is all that remains of the noun after noun root deletion since the thirdpronominal//’fi canonlyTherelativeconstructionwithnounrootdeletion,in whichtheclauserelator is a pgn suffix, very frequently occurs as the second or later member of
an appositive noun phrase. In such an environment, it might be compared to the
“unrestrictive clause” in English, in that it simply adds parenthetical information
without “restricting” the first simple noun phrase. For example, in the
appositive noun phrase marin hiu""ata ran “the money, which J am going with,

There is no deletion of the subject NP or of tense in embedding
constructions resulting from relativization, as can be seen in the above examples.
The noun root deletion mentioned at the end of the last paragraph is not to be
confused with subject NP deletion; noun root deletion is a phenomenon which is
restricted to the noun and leaves the noun phrase as a unit intact.
In the examples given above, the noun which becomes the clause relator
constitutes the subject NP of the embedded sentence. Yet there are other places
in a sentence where an NP may occur: in the verb phrase asa direct or indirect
object NPa, in the adverbial as the NP of a post-positional phrase, or even within
some other NP as part of an associative phrase. It is also possible for an NP in
any of these three environments in the embedded sentence to become the clause
relator of a relativization embedding construction, but it is a bit more
complicated. There are two alternate methods. The simplest and most frequently
used methodtifta //’tis tapa sti nit //xda//xaa !'das“the town in which I am going to teach,” and //’1i’éta ra /’apé xuu’t “whatever |

personneehin’. “I (titta) am going with (ra Niu’) them (/[ftn-a; marin “money” is a
plural common noun).” Usually, the relative construction begins with a special
conjunction, iia, when it occurs as the second or later member of an appositive
noun phrase. For example, the appositive noun phrase marin hii fata ke “utt-haa
‘iin “the money, which I had” has as its second simple noun phrase the
construction Aft’ata ke ‘tuhaa ‘ith “which I had” consisting of the special
-ta ke ‘uuhda ‘ith which would be

in the normal order titta (ke) //tiina ké “tathada ‘it. “I (titta) had (ke ‘uthaa ‘it)

nothing to the meaning of the relative construction when it is present. Withoutis to place the noun at the end of the embedded sentence, deletingSeehii’a, the preceding example would be marif titta ké wiuhaa “iin. which wouldthe subordinative suffix -@, post-position, or associative particle which follows it,
and leaving the correct interpretation of the embedded sentence to be

"At the end of any verb whichis not intransitive,there may occur a patient suffix. Semantically, all patient suffixes indicate who
or what is the “immediate patient” of the action expressed by the active verb.
By “immediate patient’? is meant the “direct object” of a transitive verb, the
“indirect object” of a ditransitive verb, or the first “indirect object” of a verb
which has been made tritransitive by the suffix -pa. Remember, however, that
what we are here calling the “immediate patient’? may also be indicated by an
NP4, in fact, the first NPa of the verb phrase in the case of all three of the above
mentioned subcategories of verbs. So, what the patient suffix does is take over
the function which would otherwise be performed by the first NPA of the verb
phrase. Accordingly, there is one less NPA in the verb phrase of a verb with a
patient suffix. For example, here is a series of similar sentences to illustrate the
various types of patient suffix. First, here is a sentence with a transitive verb,
and NPA, and no patient suffix: //’itku ke //’fipa ké mui. “They (masc., pl.) saw
him.” Now, here is a sentence with an object suffix on the verb: //fiku ke ké
muupi. “They (masc., pl.) saw him (-pi).”; one with the passive suffix (-hé) on
the verb: //iiku ke ké mutuhé. “They (masc., pl.) were seen.”; one with the
reflexive suffix (-s7) on the verb: //’riku ke ké muiusn. “They (masc., pl.) saw
themselves.”?; and one with the reciprocal suffix (-kw) on the verb: //’iiku ke
ké muuku. “They (masc., pl.) saw one another.,” and with a dual subject:
I[tikxa ke ké muuku. “They (masc., du.) saw each other.” In all of these
examples of sentences whose verbs have patient suffixes, an NPA may not occur
in the verb phrase. Each type of patient suffix, however, has its own syntactic
peculiarities which we will proceed to look at in detail.",[46]
"The Direct QuotationThe direct quotation has a structure which may be diagrammed as follows:
2.
Quote + tiThis construction has the peculiarity that the internal structure of the unit.
“Quote” is outside the syntax of the language. It is true that the quote is usually
a Nama sentence, whether declarative, interrogative, or imperative, in which case
it is governed by the rules which define any non-embedded Nama sentence, butit need not be. The quote may also be a Nama phrase or word, some utterance in
another language, an animal sound, or it may be any sound at all which may be
imitated by the human voice. The quotative particle ti (which should be
identified with the -ti which forms demonstrative manner adverbs,p.98) is nota clause relator like the ones we have seen so far since the unit it follows, the
quote, does not meet the structural qualifications for an embedded sentence,
which we have found to be very well defined.
The direct quotation may only occur in a predicate which contains one of
a small set of verbs, all of which denote processes of speaking or thinking: mit
“say,” at “call,” tit “ask,” ere’am “answer,” or #’a1 “think.” It should be
added to our list of adverbial constructions in chapter V.",[75]
"“The prisoners (masc., pl.) will be released.”; sifkxm ke #xanitka ké maahé. “We
(masc., du., excl.) were given papers.”
The post-positional phrase with xaa, which indicates “agent,” is one of the
constructions included under “‘Adverbial” in the formula for the active/stative
predicate. The post-position xaa has, actually, a broader meaning than that of
indicating the agent in a sentence whose verb has the passive suffix (see pp. 87,
103). Here are some examples where this post-positional phrase is present:
txéokxoeku ke lidoku xaa ké mtipahé . “The prisoners (masc., pl.) were toldby the guards (masc., pl.).”; sitkxma ke //nda kxoeku xaa hithé. “We (masc., du.)were helped by those people (masc., pl.).”” A disproportionate number of passive
sentences in Nama have ditransitive verbs, considering the small number of
ditransitive verbs which there are. (Notice mda and hui in the examples above.)
A possible reason for this is that the order of noun phrases in a passive sentence
with a ditransitive verb is freer than is the order in the corresponding active
sentence. As an illustration, let us take an earlier example of an active sentence
with a ditransitive verb: “dop ke tardsa pérépa ké maa. “The man gave the
woman the bread.” In this sentence, the ordering of tardsd ‘the woman + @”
and pérépa “the bread + -d” is significant, identifying the “indirect” and
“direct” objects. However, in the corresponding passive sentence, all of the noun
phrases are marked differently so that their order is not significant: tards ke ‘dop
xaa pérépa ké maahé. “The woman was given the bread by the man.” The
differential marking of each noun phrase makes permutation of the sentence
without changing the essential meaning easier (see p. 107ff.).
(3) -sn “Reflexive”
The meaning of the reflexive suffix -sn is that the subject NP expresses
both the agent and the immediate patient of the action expressed by the verb, asin /[tip ke ké muiusn. “He saw himself.” There is often an epenthetic vowel

"PERMUTATIONSo far, all example sentences have been presented in what we might call
“normal” sentence order, i.e., in the order which occurs with the greatest
frequencyand whichcan, therefore, be assumedto be basic. Furthermore, it isonly when the sentence is in this normal order that a constituent analysis as neat
as the preceding one can be performed. An important feature of Nama syntax,
however, is that it allows for considerable variety in the ordering of sentence
constituents to emphasize or de-emphasize a particular element in the sentence.
The variability in ordering is best viewed as the result of departures from the
normal order and, as such, can be reduced to three simple principles of
permutation. They are: (a) initialization, whereby an element is brought to the
beginning of the sentence, (b) finalization, whereby an element is brought to the
end of the sentence, and (c) internal scrambling, whereby certain elements
within the sentence are re-ordered. Each of these principles of permutation
incorporates a set of syntactic restrictions which govern which element may be
moved, and where it may be moved without destroying the acceptability of the
sentence to a native speaker and without changing its essential meaning.
Permutation is optional for all declarative sentences. It is obligatory for
many interrogative sentences, specifically, those which contain interrogative
words, in which case the interrogative word must be initialized. Though such
interrogativesentenceshavenotyetbeendiscussed,and will not be discusseduntil the question of the interrogative sentence can be treated as a whole (p.
141), it is useful to point out here that the permutation of an interrogative
sentence is governed by the same restrictions as that of a declarative sentence.
For now, let us restrict our discussion to the optional permutation of a
declarative sentence.
There is a way in which the structure of the interrogative sentence does
play a role in the optional permutation of the declarative. In conversation, when107Nama108Hottentot Grammara declarative sentence is uttered as a direct answer to a question posed in the
formof an interrogative sentence, that declarative sentence may be modeledonthe permuted form of that interrogative sentence. As an illustration, the answer
to the question maapdts ta !uu? “Where (mdapé) are you (-ts) going (ta ui)?”
may very well be /’éas !’odta ke ra iu. “I (-ta) am going (ra !uiu) to the town
(das V’od).” The first sentence has mdapd “where,” an interrogative word,
initialized obligatorily, while the second has the post-positional phrase /‘das !’od
“to the town” initialized optionally. The answer might also be given with the
normal order, tiita ke !’das od ra Niu. It must be emphasized that permutation
is by no means restricted to answers to questions; it is just more likely in such
cases. Permutation may often be used in other contexts, such as narrative or
description, to emphasize or de-emphasize a particular element in a sentence. It
happens that emphasis on a particular sentence constituent is inherent in an
interrogative sentence such as the one given above, and that emphasis may
stimulate a corresponding emphasis in the response to the question.
The topic of embedding has yet to be introduced though it too does have
some bearing on the topic of permutation. The embedding of a sentence in
certain sentence constituents often makes permutation of the matrix sentence
more likely; this is especially true of embedding in adverbials (p. 126).
We shall now discuss the three principles of permutation, and then try to
formulate a general statement.","[60, 61]"
"64NamaHottentot GrammarWe have been speaking of the Nama tenses as if they had meanings which
were comprehensible in isolation. Such is not really the case. The system of
tenses is very much inter-connected with the system of aspects; the two systems,
as will be shown, are not readily understandable when taken separately. This is
true of the active verb phrase only, since the stative verb phrase does not involve
the system of aspects.
2. AspectHere, once again, is the formula for the active verb phrase, with the aspect
constituents in italics:
(NPa) + (NPa) + Te + mp)+ V[+act]+ (Perf)Both imperfective and perfective aspect are marked by morphemes, which
realize the symbols “Imp” and ‘‘Perf.” However, as noted by the parentheses,
these aspect markers are optional. When neither of them is present, the active
verb phrase is inflected for a third, unmarked, aspect which we may call the
“punctual aspect.” Since “Imp” and “Perf” cannot co-occur, we thus have an
aspect system with three members. The unmarked punctual aspect will be
treated first.a. Punctual aspect. Punctual Aspect may occur with all tenses except the
present tense. A sentence whose verb phrase has this aspect describes an event as
happening at a discrete point in time. Verb phrases with punctual aspect have
the following structure with the different tenses::.","[38, 39]"
"88NamaHottentot Grammarc. Absence of the Predicate. It is possible for the predicate of a stative
verb phrase to be absent entirely, as in the sentence ‘dop ke ké ‘ir. “It was the
man.” or, ‘dop ke ko ‘it. “It was the man (recently).” Observe that this type of
sentence must be translated with the impersonal “it” in English; it would be
closer to say “The man was.” In the present tense, we would expect ’dop ke ‘a.
“It is the man.” However, this construction is recognized by the informants to
be “Deep Nama,” a form of solemn speech never used in ordinary conversation.
The form which we actually find in usual speech is ""dop ke. “It is the man.” with
the present tense-copula ‘a deleted. We do not find this construction used with
the future or indefinite tenses.
Most cases of a stative verb phrase without a predicate occur after a noun
phrase which has resulted from relativization or nominalization, e.g., /xuu haa
‘dop ke ké “it. “It was a rich man.,” or better, “He was a rich man.” (Comparethis with dop ke !xuu hda. “The man has gotten rich.”) The sentence [[ tip keIxuu haa ’éo ké it. has basically the same meaning but with an emphasis on the
“he”: “He was a rich man.,” though this sentence has an NP-Comp predicate,
viz., [xuu haa ‘Go. A very frequent use of the stative verb phrase without a
predicateOFThe Verb Phrase
1. Negation of the Active Verb PhraseIt will be remembered that in the unnegated active verb phrase, there is a
system of three aspects: punctual, imperfective, and perfective (p. o4ff.). In thenegated active verb phrase, the meanings “imperfective” and “perfectivediscuss the punctual aspect first.
a. Negation in the Punctual Aspect. As defined earlier (p. 64), a sentence
whose verb phrase has punctual aspect describes an event as happening at a
discrete point in time; punctual aspect may occur with all tenses except the
present tense. Negative verb phrases with punctual aspect have the following
structure with the different tenses:is with a nominalized sentence in the future tense; the whole resultingconstruction must be translated with the expression “supposed to.” For
example, if the sentence //’fip ke nit Nit. “He will go.” is nominalized and made
the subject of a sentence with a stative verb phrase without a predicate in theC. NEGATIONA negative sentence in Nama is a sentence having a negative morpheme as a
constituent of the verb phrase. Although the two types of verb phrase, active
and stative, are different in structure, they are negated in very much the same
way: by the presence of the negative mono-morphemic word tama after the
verb in the active verb phrase, or after the predicate in the stative verb phrase,
in all tenses but the future where the word is tite. However, the introduction ofthe negative tama (or tite) causes several syntactic and semantic complications,
the most important of these being a major alteration in the aspect system of the
active verb phrase which, surprisingly, helps to explain some complications in
the negation of the aspectless stative verb phrase. Let us now look at some of the
ways in which the two types of verb phrase are affected by negation.remote pastké
(NPa) + (NP&) +past tense the result is: //’fip nii luis ke ké ’if. “He was supposed to go.” (Aliteral approximation would be “His will going was.”) The last sentence would,
most likely, occur in the permuted form: //’tip nii Its ké “its ke. The subjects of
relativization and nominalization will be discussed later (p. 123ff.).aremerged into one general meaning which we will call “non-punctual, resulting in
a system of two aspects: punctual and non-punctual. The meaning “‘nonpunctual” is conveyed morphologically by forms similar to those conveying the
meaning “perfective” in the unnegated case (p. 66) as will be seen presently.
The meaning of ‘punctual’ is the same with or without negation, so we willkoka++ V{tact}tama + it recent pastindefinitetite¢futureIf this chart is compared with the one on p. 64, we note the following
differences: 1. the presence of the negative word tama followed by the past
copula 7 after the verb in the past and indefinite tenses, 2. the absence of the
future particle nii before the verb, and 3. the presence of tite after the verb in
the future. The last two differences amount to the fact that we have V[tact] +
tite where we would expect nii + V[+act] + tama + it.
The same tense movement which may occur with the perfective aspect in
the active verb phrase (p. 67) and in the stative verb phrase (p. 87) may also
occur in any negated verb phrase. In fact, negated verb phrases almost always
occur with the tense particle following the verb and tama. With tense movement,

"Nama Hottentot Grammar142. Particles and Suffixes
The morpheme structure class of “particles and suffixes” contains
morphemes with a maximum of one mora. Particles are free forms and have one
mora, suffixes are bound and have one mora or none. Any consonant except a
click consonant may occur in morphemes of this structural class. There are no
restrictions on the vowels:i, e, a, 0, oru mayoccur; and neither are there anyrestrictions on the tones: high, middle, or low may occur.
Particles may have the canonical forms CV and CN. (The C may not bea
nasal in CN.) They are always words with more “grammatical” than “lexical”
meaning. The distribution classes which are filled by a morpheme with the formof a particleare:associative particle (ti), imperative-hortativeparticle (ré),present copula (‘a), declarative particle (ke), emphatic declarative particle (km),
imperfective aspect particle (ra), tense (all except the future), quotative particle
(ti), emphatic interrogative particle (kxa), and vocative particle (he).
Suffixes may have the canonical forms CV, CN, V,N, and C. The last case
contains no morae and there are only three morphemes with this form. They are
all markers of person, gender, and number: -p “first person masculine singular,”
-s “second and third person feminine singular,” and -ts “second person masculine
singular.” Suffixes of the other canonical forms are far more numerous andcomprise the following distribution classes: markers of person, number, andgender, the diminutive (-r6 on noun, verb, and adjective roots), adjective-derivingsuffixes,number-derivingsuffix(-k6),subordinatesuffix(-aonnouns),adverb-deriving suffixes, verb derivational suffixes (with some exceptions), and
V-NP derivational suffixes.
3.","[13, 14]"
"The Derived AdverbThe demonstrative adverb described in the preceding section is merely a
special type of derived adverb. Besides the demonstrative adverb suffixes, Nama
has a number of suffixes which may be suffixed to roots other than
demonstratives to form adverbs. The suffixes will be presented in order of
decreasing productivity.
a. -se “Manner”. The suffix -se “manner” may be added to an NP-Comp
or a verb root to form an adverb.
Most often, the NP-Comp to which the suffix is added consists only of an
adjective: kdise ‘very,’ with ka? “‘big’’, Idise “well,” with /ai “good”; suptise“easily,” with sup “soft”; /’urtxase “in a dirty manner,” with /’urixa “dirty”;
#xarirose“alittlebit,’with#Axariré‘‘a little”;‘am’ase“truly,”with‘am’a“true.” The suffix may also be added to a few numbers: /tise “alone,” with /ur“one”; //ndatikose “so much,” with the derived number //ndatiké “so much.”
The NP-Comp may also be a noun stem, e.g., kdd’aose “in a kingly
manner,” with the root in ka6’aop “‘king.”’ Adverbs derived from noun stems are
used in sentences like the following: //’tip ke kad’aose haa. “He is being a king.”or “He is behaving like a king.”; //’fip ke kad’aose ra muusn. “He thinks he is a
king.,” literally, “He sees himself in a kingly manner.”; tif kxOen ke
#ae-H#ut aose titta ra kb6/’1i. “My people (tii kxden) look upon (ra k66/7it) me
(titta) as a leader (Ave-Aut’aose).”
More rarely, the suffix is added to a verb root, e.g., /xdése “in a running
manner,” with /xdéé “run.” If, in a sentence, the verb root to which -se is added
is the same as the verb root in the verb of the verb phrase, the adverb has an
“intensive” meaning: //’fip ke #nuiuse ké #nwiu. “He really sat down!”’; arip ke
Ixdése nit !xdé. “The dog will really run!” Sometimes, -se is used also with
nouns in this “intensive”? meaning, e.g., arise ‘arip “a real dog!” or “quite somedog!”
For -se as a clause relator, see p. 131.
b. -pe “Manner”. The suffix -pe has been glossed “manner” because its
meaning appears to be very similar to -se but with a slight difference which is
difficult to define since -pe is not a productive suffix like -se. The only case of
their contrast is in the two adverbs //’duise “‘in vain” and //’dtipe “almost,” both
derived from the adjective root //’dd “scant.” Usually, adverbs with -pe have an
implication of “‘periodicity.”” We can see this to be true in the few remaining
examples of adverbs with -pe: #ndrupe “around, ina circle,” with the verb root
#naru “to go ina circle”; *dipe “firstly, in the meantime,” with the verb root ‘di“be forward” (this verb root only appears in derived forms, e.g., dis “face’’).",[56]
"3. Class 2:The NumberThe order class immediately before the modifier, Class 2, may optionallyNama34Hottentot Grammarbe realized by one of a class of constructions called “numbers.” According to its

These words do not have the meanings “much” and “‘little”’; these meanings are
conveyed by the adjectives kdf “‘big, great,” and Axarv “‘little” when they occur
before a mass noun, e.g., #xart marirén “a little money (indefinite gender).” In
this example the diminutive -rdé is added to the noun marin “some money” for
emphasis.
(2) The Cardinal Number
Nama has a decimal numbering system. There are ten monomorphemic
cardinal numbers for one to ten, and two polymorphemic numbers for hundred
and thousand:“six”
“seven”
“eight”“one”
“two”
“three”Inant
hui
//xatsdhaka“four”kxoese“nine”’koro“five”tist“ten”jar
/ém
Inond“hundred” (lit. “big ten’’)
kaftisi
“thousand” (lit. “full big ten’’)
/’éa (kai) tistBy their canonical form, the numbers //xdisd “eight” and kxdese “‘nine”’ appear
to have been, etymologically, composed of a root plus a suffix, though, atpresent, there is no root with the form //xdi and the only word with which we
may compare kxdese “nine” is the homophonous form kxdese “in a human
manner.” The number fisf “ten” also diverges from the usual form of Nama
roots in having an inter-vocalic /s/ in the root. It is undoubtedly a borrowedword for reasons to be mentioned.
Numbers above ten are formed by juxtaposition according to the commonformula that if a smaller number follows a larger number the two are added, anddOihe INOUN Fhraseif the smaller number follows the larger the two are multiplied. The conjunction
tsii “and” may optionally follow kdi tis’ “hundred” if the number is not yet
complete.
There is one complication. In numbers above fisi “ten,” the morpheme
which follows fist, if there is one, the ‘units digit,” will itself be followed by
another morpheme / ‘aa which we may call the “units marker.” For example: tis?/ut/’aa “eleven” (lit. “tentone /’aa”) /nond tisi /ém /’aa “thirty-two” (lit.“three x ten + two /’aa’”’). In numbers from “eleven” to “nineteen,” the tis? is
optional, e.g., “eleven” may be /ui /‘aa. It seems plausible that the “unitsmarker” /’aa may have been an earlier morpheme
borrowed from whatever source.
Here are some examples of large numbersdescription:for “ten” before fist wasas illustrations of the above/ui /’6a kai tist kxdese kat tisi (tsit) ant tist /ém /’aa “onethousand nine hundred (and) sixty-two” (lit. “cone x thousand + nine x hundred
+ six x ten + two ‘units’ ”); /ui kai tisi (tsit) tist /aisd “doku “a hundred and ten
strong men.”” When the number in a noun phrase is /ur “‘one” or /dm “two” the
noun must, of course, agree with it in number, e.g., /u kai /irip ‘one large malejackal,” /ém kat /irikxa “two large male jackals,” and with numbers /nond
“three” and above the noun must be plural, /nond kar /irtku “three large male
jackals.”
Though cardinal numbers may contain quite a large number of morphemes, all possible cardinal numbers should be regarded as “‘simple” from the
point of view of grammatical description, although “simple” in all other
constituent classes is synonymous with “monomorphemic.” We should consider
them so because the formula according to which large numbers (above ten) are
constructed is very different from what we would call a “grammatical rule.”
Nowhere else in the grammar does the order of constituents convey meanings
such as “addition” and “multiplication” depending on a precise semantic
ranking of the morphemes such as the “‘size’’ or “lateness in the counting series”
of numbers. That is why the formation of large numbers has been referred to as
following a “formula” and not a “grammatical rule.” This formula more
properly belongs in the lexicon of the language and reflects the “mathematical
technology” of the speakers of the language. Any large number constructed by
formula is equivalent as far as the grammar of the language is concerned in that
the noun with which it occurs must have a plural suffix; such is true of all
,
numbers above /nond “three.”b. The Derived Number. A derived number consists of a demonstrative
manner adverb plus the suffix -kéd “as much as, as many as.” For example:neetiké //’éép “this much time,” with the demonstrative manner adverb neetiNama Hottentot Grammar36pee“thus, in this manner”; neetiko kat ‘doku “this many big men”; //naattko // dép
“that much time, so much time,” with the demonstrative manner adverb |/ndati“thus, in that manner”; //ndatiké kin “that many sheep, so many sheep.”
Besides neetiko and /|ndatiko, there is an interrogative derived number, mdatiko
“how much,” with the interrogative demonstrative manner adverb mdati “how,in what manner”; this one will be discussed presently under “The Interrogative
Noun Phrase.”","[23, 24, 25]"
"When another sentence element is brought into initial position, it must be placedsdTsin the positionof the NPS. When this happens, the NPS must be deleted, butPCIEULaAtImay be reintroduced in an NPA after the declarative particle ke. If we symbolizethe initialized element as ““X”’, the following structure results:
X + pen,+ pgn, +-a)+...
tke +(NPSThe two pgn suffixes are marked with a subscript numeral to indicate that they
must be the same morpheme. What is contained in parentheses amounts to a
noun phrase duplicating the original subject NP, followed by the subordinative
suffix @. It is to this unit that we give the term “deposed subject.” It is
important to emphasize that the deposed subject is optional; in fact, in the
greater number of permuted sentences it is not present. If the original subject NP
was only a pronoun, a deposed subject would be entirely redundant and would
only be present if special emphasis on the pronoun were desired. The pgn, is
thus a_clitic pronoun.
We may term the pgn suffix which is retained before ke the “subject
indicator” (si). With those pgn suffixes which have allomorphs, which
allomorphs is realized is conditioned by the last phoneme in the initialized
element.
A simple example should elucidate the foregoing discussion. Take thefollowing sentence in normal order: nee ‘dop ke !’das !’0d ra hiu. “This man (nee
‘dop) is going (ra /uix) to the town (/’das !’od).” According to the preceding
analysis, the beginning of this sentence has the following structure:
nee ‘Got+-ptke...",[61]
"A fewof theseare:hoo/naa“suspect,”from hoo“find”; /’do/nda “becowardly,” from / do “to fear.”
Of the examples given in the preceding paragraphs, kodtapa “‘tecall, lookback” and //‘amdxuu “sell” do not have meanings which are the sums of the
meanings of their component parts, so that we are forced to consider them to be
single morphemes, or at least to be more “unified” compounds than the other
examples.
(3) Other Compound Verb Root Types
There are a small number of compound verbs which have a noun root as
one of their members, but such compounds do not appear to be formed
according to any regular grammatical rule. The noun root may be either the first
member or the second: kxddkun “suspect, from the noun root in kxdés
“backside” plus the verb root kunu “rub,” literally meaning “have an itchyfeeling in the backside”; //xae#id ‘‘console,” from //xae “to curb” plus the
noun root in #ddp “the heart.”” Compounds
metaphorical nature.of this type are usually of a veryc. Verb Root Derivation. A few verb roots are the result of the addition of
a suffix to a simple verb root. Such a suffix may be called a “verb root
derivational suffix.” This type of suffix is not “productive” in that it only
occurs in a very small number of verbs, in contrast to the verb stem derivational
suffixes (to be treated in the next section) which may be suffixed to any active
verb root. Furthermore, a verb root with a verb root derivational suffix may
be one member of a compound verb, e.g., in *dn’am-—Aaa “lock up (someone)”
where #dn’am “close up” is composed of the simple verb root #é/ “block up”
plus the suffix -’am which roughly means “mouth.” Another example is mdi-#in
“block by standing something in the way,” where mai “stand up (something)” isNama72Hottentot Grammarcomposed of maa “stand up” plus the causative suffix -7. There are four verb
root derivational suffixes and we will now look at each of them in turn.
(1) -’am
A dozen verbs or so have the suffix -’am. Although its meaning is often not
precisely definable, the morpheme -’amm appears to be etymologically related to
the morpheme in the noun ‘ams “‘mouth.”’ The following examples should show
the semantic basis for such a relationship: //xopda’am “to open,” with the simpleverb root //xopd “break,” thus, “break-mouth”; 4éf’am“to close,” with thesimple verb root 4a@7 “block,” thus, “block-mouth”; /x66’am “‘agree,” with the
simple verb root /x66 “‘catch, grab,” thus, “catch-mouth”; //ut’am “take aim,”
with the verb //ui “place (something) in a lying position,” thus “place-mouth”;
//oe’am “waylay,” with the verb root //dé “lie down,” thus, “lie down (at the)
mouth,” There are a few more verbs with -’am that cannot be analyzed so easily:Vere'am“answer”; /uu’am“to near”; mdin’am “drink by mouth”; //aén’am‘have a snack.” In the last two examples, the /n/ in main and //dén may be
etymologically connected to the reflexive suffix -sn, in which case they would
translate literally, main’am “place in a standing position-oneself-mouth,” and
//aén’am “‘chew-oneself-mouth.” In all of the above examples, -’am can be
glossed as “‘mouth” in various degrees of metaphorical extension, from mdin’am
where it refers to a bodily orifice, to /x66’am where it refers to an abstract idea.
(2) -1
The suffix -7, which has a “causative”? meaning, only occurs with a small
number of roots and, in each case, is accompanied by morphophonenic changes
(see p. 19). Along with the subordinative suffix -@, this is the only other suffix
which does not begin with a consonant. This peculiarity of structure accounts
for the morphophonemics of this suffix and the subordinative suffix since it
results in the contiguity of two vowels. Causative -7 occurs most frequently with
the position verbs: mai “place (something) in a standing position,” with the verb
root maa “‘stand up”; #ndi “place (something) in a sitting position,” with theThe Verb Phrase73suffix -xd is related, at least etymologically, to the verb root hda “‘come,” so that
the verbs given above come from compound verbs: *Aia-hda, *#’od-haa, and*//oa-haa. That the starred compounds do not occur in Nama is significant, if
negative, evidence.","[42, 43]"

"“We (sitke, masc., pl., excl.) arrived (ké sf1) there (//ndapd) by bus (pdas /xda).”
Thissentencemayhavethefollowingformswithfinalizationof differentconstituents: sifke ke pdas /xda ké stt //ndapd. siike ke //ndapd ké sir pdas /xda.
sitke ke ké sii //ndapd pdas /xda. Unlike initialization, finalization causes no
great difference in emphasis; all of the last three sentences would best be glossed
the same as the sentence in normal order.
Here is another example, this time with a sentence having a subordinated
noun phrase (NPA): /xuu haa ‘dop ke kai tdasip tséesd ké #Hat#’ti. ““T he rich
man (/xuu haa ‘dop) declared (ké #ai#’ut) a day of great celebration (kat taasip114Nama Hottentot Grammartséesd).” The direct object NPA, kdi taasip tséesd ‘‘a day of great celebration,”
may
be finalized, resulting in: /xuu haa ""dop ke ké #at#'Ui kai taasip tséesd.
In a stative sentence, the only constituent which may be finalized is an
adverbial, since stative sentences lack subordinated noun phrases (NPA) as a rule.
Thus, the earlier example hddp ke ‘Grip xaa ‘a kai. “The horse (hdép) is bigger (a
kai) than the dog (arip xaa).” may be permuted to: hddp ke ‘a kai “arip xaa.
which would have the same gloss.
One other construction must be included in this discussion of finalization,
and that is the finalized deposed subject, which is a special case of a
subordinated noun phrase and, therefore, falls under the rule given at the
beginning of this section. This phenomenon may only occur in a sentence where
some constituent is initialized. If the direct object in the sentence /xuu hda ‘dop
ke kai tdasip tséesad ké #ai#’Ut. “The rich man declared a day of great
celebration.” is initialized, the result is: kd? tdasip tséesap ke Ixuu hada ‘dopa ké
#aiF'ui, “The rich man declared a day of great celebration.” Then, if the
deposed subject /xuu haa ‘dopa is finalized, the result is: kdi tdasip tséesap ke ké
Fai#'ui Ixuu hda ""dopa. This last sentence is so permuted as to verge on
awkwardness.

"The hyphenated term “‘imperative-hortative” has been given to this type of
sentence because the term “imperative” means that the sentence is used to give a
command, which means that the subject of an imperative sentence must always
be in the second person. However, in Nama, the same sentence structure which isused to issue commands may also be used to form sentences with a subject in the
first or third person; this type of sentence we shall call a “hortative” sentence.
Thus, the imperative sentence and the hortative sentence are two special cases of
a more general type of sentence, though there are a few minor structural
differences between them. The meaning of this more general type of sentence,
the imperative-hortative, is that the speaker expects his hearer to turn the
proposition contained in the sentence into reality. It is hoped that this semantic
definition will become clearer when we examine some specific examples later in
the chapter.
A.",[79]
"An examination of the examples given in the previous paragraph will reveal
that the events described by a sequential sentence must necessarily follow one
upon the other. It is no coincidence that all of the verbs in these two sentences
describe motion from one place to another; this is usually true of sequential
sentences. However, is many cases the last verb is not a verb which describes
motion, and in such cases a special type of embedding usually occurs. The two
verbs sit “‘go and arrive” and haa ‘‘come and arrive” may be embedded into the
last sentence as adverbs without any “‘clause relator,” or morphological indicator
of embedding (p. 132); these verbs are often accompanied by a place adverb
such as //naapd “‘there.”’ The embedding of these verbs has the semantic effect of
designating the last verb as describing the termination of a sequence of motions.
This can be seen in the examples which follow: tstita ke titta stv tsti tii !aati
/xda sti ké thod. “And (tsti) I (tiitd) went (siz) and (tsi7), having arrived (sii),conversed (ké /hdd) with my sisters (¢i7 ldati /xéa).”; tsitku ke |’apdmamka /xii
tsti //ndapa haa siiké ké !x66, “And (tsi7) the policemen (/’épd/namka) came
(/xii) and (tsii), having arrived (haa) there (//ndapa), caught (ké !x006) us. (sitké,
masc., pl., excl.).” The device is so frequently used, that it would be more
accurate to eliminate “having arrived,’’ which translates sii in the first sentence
and hda in the second, from the translation.",[67]
"“Did he (p... //’iipa) eat (ke # vu) themeat ({/an’e)?” The verb may be initialized i in a similar fashion: #’uup ké //’tipa//an’e? “Did he (-p... //’tipa) eat (#’uu.. . ke) the meat (//an’é)? Notice how,!xdisa. “They (/P ku, masc., pl.) knew (ke #’an ‘7ii) at what place we were (mda
Ixdis “dikxrn had !xdisd).” The embedded sentence is: mda !xdis ’dikxm haa? “Atin the last example, the tense particle is moved to the position after the
constituent “Int,” here represented by ¢, to prevent the sentence from ending
with a tense particle. Nama’s aversion to having a sentence begin or end witha
tense, aspect, or copula particle has been mentioned earlier in chapter
VI. With
the emphatic interrogative particle kxa, the last sentence would be: #’up kxawhat place (maa Ixdis ’av) were (haa, lit., “are”) we (-kxm, masc. du.)?”ké //’tipa //an’é? “Did he eat the meat?!”translated “Where are we going?” //’iiku ke ké #’Gn ‘if mda Ixdis ‘dikxm haa144Nama Hottentot GrammarAs is the case with the content interrogative sentence, a deposed subject
NPA may always be re-initialized, even though another part of the sentence hasalready been initialized. Thus, we may have: //’tipa #’uiup ké //an’é? “Did he
(/[’tipa...-p) eat (Fu... ké) the meat (//an’é)?” Here, the semantic focus is
on both the subject NPa and the verb, which is equivalent to saying that the
direct object NPa is de-emphasized. This doubly permuted sentence is, in actual]
fact, a very frequent form of the truth interrogative. It is the closest thing to a
truth interrogative without special emphasis that is commonly used.
The type of initialization which occurs in a declarative sentence whereby
the VPN and TAC are both initialized is not permissible in an interrogative
sentence;theTACmaynever be initialized.","[78, 79]"
"2. Embedding in the Post-positional PhraseEmbedding in the post-positional phrase is not really another type of
embedding, but rather a case of nominalization or relativization in a specific
environment, viz., before a post-position. However, there are two facts about
embedding of this sort which necessitate our giving it special treatment, (a)
Embedding in a noun before certain post-positions is semantically very similar to
embedding in certain adverbial constructions., and (b) A post-positional phrase
which contains a case of embedding is more likely to be moved in the sentence
by permutation than is one that contains an ordinary noun phrase, usually by
initialization.erasST TTNominalizationfunctions“after”kxGo!dabeforethe compoundpost-positions ’ai/‘aa@ ‘“‘before” andsemanticallyinverylanguagethemuchlikeembedding in the adverb with the temporal clause relators ‘00 “when” and hii’a“while,” though from a syntactic point of view the two types of embedding are

"Person-Gender-Number Suffixes and the Subordinative Suffix. There isa suffix in Nama which has the canonical form V, the subordinative (“‘case”’
suffix -d, and when it occurs it always follows a noun suffix which indicates
person, gender, and number with one of the following canonical forms C, CN, N,
or CV. When it follows suffixes of the forms C, CN, or N, it simply adds a mora
