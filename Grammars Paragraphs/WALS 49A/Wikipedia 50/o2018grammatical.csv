Phrase-level syntax
8.1Introduction
This chapter discusses phrase-level syntax in Kamsá. A phrase may be considered a set ofone or more words functioning together as a syntactic unit, a unit usually smaller than (or a
constituent of) a clause. A phrase consists minimally of a single word, but more often contains
multiple words. In Kamsá, there are noun phrases (8.2), verb phrases, (8.3), postpositional
phrases (9.4), and prepositional phrases (8.5). Although prepositional phrases only occur with
Spanish loan words, they are very common in the language. There are some phrase-level clitics,
including the topic marker =na which occurs at the end of a noun phrase (8.2.3.2) and case
marking clitics at the end of noun phrases (8.2.3.1). Case marking is discussed further in (3.3.3).
8.2Noun phrases
A noun phrase consists minimally of a noun (common or proper), pronoun (personal orindefinite), substantive determiner (demonstrative: ch ‘the’; kem ‘that’; mwa ‘that’ or inÿe
‘other’, all functioning as a noun ) or substantive numeral (number functioning as a noun). Noun
phrases can include other constituents, such as determiners, adjectives, and prenominal numerals.
They also have case markers, which tend to go on the noun but can also occur at the end of the
entire NP or on multiple constituents in the NP, namely the noun and an adjective that agrees
with the noun. Some constituents of an NP can exhibit overt agreement with the head noun,
indexing the same semantic case and noun class or reflecting the same evaluative suffix as the
noun. Adjectives have class suffixes that agree with their nouns. Additionally, determiners, some
pronouns, and numerals in certain environments bear class suffixes that agree with the classes of
their referents, namely when they follow the noun or when they are in a different NP from the
noun that they agree with, as discussed in 6.3. Furthermore, a number of NP constituents are
marked with evaluative suffixes when they follow or are used substantively: nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, determiners, and numerals, both within a noun phrase or across noun phrases (see1933.3.2 for evaluatives). Sometimes these constituents will have evaluative suffixes when they
precede a noun, but generally not.
Determiners and numerals always precede the heads of noun phrases, with determiners
preceding numerals. Adjectives generally follow the noun, but due to the free word order of
Kamsá they can sometimes precede the noun. There seems to be no appreciable difference in
meaning. Possessors always precede the noun.
Thus, the order of constituents in a NP is as follows:
[determiner] [possessor] [numeral] [adjective] [noun] [adjective] [adjective]
8.2.1Heads of noun phrases
The head of a noun phrase is often a noun, but can also be a non-archetypical nominal,such as substantive adjectives, personal pronouns, numerals, and determiners (used
substantively). Numbers and determiners always precede the noun, whereas adjectives can
precede or follow the noun.
If a personal pronoun is the head of the noun phrase, then no other constituents are
permitted. However, the pronoun can exhibit case marking and/or bear an evaluative suffix, with
the case marking always at the end of the noun phrase. Because indefinite pronouns do not show
up frequently in my corpus it is not clear if there can be other constituents in a noun phrase
headed by an indefinite pronoun or what suffixes and clitics can be marked. Two determiners,
the demonstrative kem ‘this, that’ and inÿe ‘other’ can also be heads of NPs when used
substantively. The definite article ch can also stand alone as an NP, but it is more common for
the third person singular pronoun cha, to serve as the entire NP, (8.2.1.2). Determiners are
discussed in 5.4 but here are simply defined as words that show definiteness and/or specificity
and precede the noun (as opposed to adjectives which can precede or follow the noun).
The following subsections detail the use of various word categories as heads of NPs.","[203, 204, 205, 206, 207]"

First, I would like to thank all of the Kamsás who welcomed me into their lives: Carmen,
without whom nothing would have been possible; Margarita, Clemencia, Anita, and Maria
Clementina for teaching me their language; Alejandro for all the wonderful conversations about
language, philosophy, and life; as well as Margarita, Andrés, Ivan, Miguel, Luis, Sandra, and
Rosita.
I have been extremely lucky to have worked with Lyle Campbell, who is the best advisor
anyone could ever hope for. I would also like to thank my committee members, William
O’Grady, Gary Holton, Bob Blust, and Alex Mawyer; and Robert Littman, who was the reason I
was able to do a graduate degree at the University of Hawai‘i.
My friends in Bogotá offered me incredible support. I would like to thank Pipe for
dedicating his time to working with me on Kamsá; Gustavo, whose conversations kept me going;
Jennifer for always being willing to accompany me into the jungle; Andrea, one of the most
lovely people in the world; Andrés for the evenings in La Candelaria; Edinson for our lunches
together; Daniel for being my bodyguard; Francisco and Gloria for their hospitality; Lili for
being my Colombian mother and friend; Javier for the inspiration; David for the breaks from el
centro; Leidy for sharing insights about Kamsá; Camilo for being wonderful; Jorge for our
mornings in Juan Valdez; Paul for the walks in the rain; Laura and Rajiv … I don’t know where
to begin; Gerriet for always helping; Arturo for becoming my friend at BBC; Ricardo for our
time together; Fernando for helping me before I knew Spanish; Mauricio for making things a
little more fun; Alejandro and Juan for giving me a home; Yinneth for her great knowledge; Katy
for the chats over coffee; and Youlin for helping me before she even knew me. There have been
many other people in Colombia whom I’m grateful to as well: Luisa for opening her home to me;
Henry in Sibundoy; Gloria in Manizales.
Some friends from the US visited me during my time in Colombia, making my time there
even more pleasant. I’d like to thank John for making the first trip to Sibundoy with me; Ariane
for staying in touch … hopefully we see each other more; Noah, these years have been crazy;
Erik for always being there to talk and helping edit more drafts of things than I can count;
Joachim for being willing to do anything; Craig for being a great friend and going with me to the
beach.
Other friends who’ve been supportive during my degree, some of whom I’ve known
since elementary school, some I’ve met more recently: Don, Vlad, Laura, Jonathan, and Verna.
I’d also like to thank my parents.
Other mentors who have guided me during my PhD include Bryan, without whom I may
never have done academia; Caleb for always seeming to believe in me; Thiago for offering
advice along the way in Colombia; and Brett for the advice and contacts, starting in Cambridge.
I’d like to thank friends and classmates in Hawai‘i who’ve helped in various ways
throughout the PhD process: Eve, Kirsten, Samantha, Kavon, John, Ryan, Sejung, Victoria,
George, Laura, Clara, Kevin, Adila, and Melody.
I am also grateful for the generous agencies that have helped fund my research including
the Bilinski Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, the American Association of
University Women, and the Foundation for Endangered Languages.
Finally, I’d like to thank Russell.iiABSTRACT
This dissertation presents a description of the grammar of Kamsá, an endangered
language isolate spoken in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia. It is the first
developed account of the language’s phonology, morphology, and syntax.
Kamsá is highly endangered due to the displacement of speakers and language shift. A
reference grammar of a previously under-described language offers a number of potential
benefits to general linguistics, showing what is possible in human languages. In addition to
typologists, comparative and historical linguists are always interested to see whether an assumed
isolate may, in fact, be demonstrably related to a known language family. The increasing
endangerment of Kamsá, heightened by the displacement of Kamsá speakers from their ancestral
home, has made the need for documentation and description extremely urgent, and this grammar
will perhaps be useful for the creation of pedagogical materials, as well.iiiTABLE OF CONTENTSACKNOWLEDGMENTS .................................................................................................. ii

Introduction
1.1Summary
This dissertation presents a description of the grammar of Kamsá, an endangeredlanguage isolate spoken in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia. It is the first
developed account of the language’s phonology, morphology, and syntax.
Kamsá is highly endangered due to the displacement of speakers and language shift. A
reference grammar of a previously under-described language offers a number of potential
benefits to general linguistics, showing what is possible in human languages. In addition to
typologists, comparative and historical linguists are always interested to see whether an assumed
isolate may, in fact, be demonstrably related to a known language family. The increasing
endangerment of Kamsá, heightened by the displacement of Kamsá speakers from their ancestral
home, has made the need for documentation and description extremely urgent, and this grammar
will perhaps be useful for the creation of pedagogical materials, as well.
This introductory chapter to this dissertation is organized as follows:
In 1.2, I discuss the Kamsá people and language, including the location, culture, relationship to
other languages, borrowing, and the name of the language. In 1.3 I discuss the language ecology
and language vitality, and in 1.4 I discuss previous research on the language. In 1.5 I describe my
methodology, and in 1.6 I give a typological overview of the language.
1.2The Kamsá people and language
Kamsá [ISO 639-3 kbh, Glottocode cams1241] is an endangered language isolate spokenby fewer than 500 people in southern Colombia. According to ONIC (Organizacion Nacional
Indigena de Colombia, ‘National Indigenous Organization of Colombia’), the Kamsá population
is 4,773 (onic.org). Although attempts have been made to find relationships to other language
families such as the Chichban family, none has been successful (see 1.4.2). The Kamsá people
have shared the Sibundoy Valley with the Inga people (who are speakers of a Quechuan
language) for over 500 years, and they share many cultural similarities such as the important1carnival holiday, their use of yagé (ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic concoction), and their blue and
red wool ponchos.
1.2.1Location and history
The homeland of the Kamsá people lies in the Sibundoy Valley, a relatively high plateauat about 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) above sea level, surrounded by higher mountains. The
population is centered around the municipality of Sibundoy, the GPS coordinates of which are
1°12’N, 76°55’W (1.20, -76.92). The municipality lies about half-way between the cities of
Pasto and Mocoa in the northwest corner of the Putumayo department of Colombia. The region
serves as a passageway between the lowlands and the highlands and for this reason has long been
important for the migration of people (Ramírez de Jara & Pinzón Castaño 1992:288). The
municipality of Sibundoy is composed of four different towns: Sibundoy, Santiago, San
Francisco, and Colόn, The Kamsá language area also extends somewhat into two neighboring
corregimientos (population centers below the level of municipality): San Pedro and San Andrés.
The largest concentration of ethnic Kamsá is found within the town of Sibundoy proper and its
surrounding veredas (rural areas outside a city or town), but there are also some Kamsá in the
small town of San Francisco.
Map 1 (on the following page) shows where Sibundoy is within Colombia. Pasto is to the
west, and Mocoa to the east.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"261.6.1Phonetics and phonology
Kamsá’s phonemic inventory is average for languages. There are 19 consonant phonemesand 6 vowel phonemes. The consonant inventory is marked by its large number of sibilants (both
fricatives and affricates). Also, the language has many consonant clusters. The series of voiced
stops /b, nd, ng/ is unusual, where /b/ is not prenasalized phonetically but the other two are.
There are a few phonemes that are borrowed from Spanish, including /d/, /g/, /ʎ/ and /r/,
although the language had the two prenasalized stops previously.
1.6.2Morphology and word classes
Kamsá has complex morphology and is polysynthetic. There are prefixes and suffixes,but not infixes or circumfixes. Verbs are primarily prefixing. Nouns and adjectives primarily
have suffixes. But verbs also bear suffixes, and all parts of speech can have certain suffixes.
Nouns and adjectives can have prefixes, as well.
Verbs have prefixes for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, evidentiality, emphasis, and
more, and have a few suffixes for TAM and nominalization. Kamsá verbs have morphological
marking distinguishing singular, plural, and dual. There is a distinction between present, recent
past, distant past, and future. There’s a two-way system of evidential marking. Negation is
shown with a negator and verbal prefixes; the verb has several options for prefixes. There are a
few clitics, as well, including subordinators.
Nouns have suffixes. These suffixes show number, case, class, and more. Noun class
markers are part of the noun; the noun cannot appear without its class marker. Cases can stack,
i.e. a noun can bear multiple case markers. Nouns can also appear with postpositions, but they do
not have to. Case markers may be clitics or may be suffixes. Nouns can be singular, plural, or
dual, shown by suffixes, but number marking on nouns is not obligatory.
1.6.3Word order and syntax
The basic order of basic constituents in Kamsá seems to be SOV but it is extremelyflexible and is also perhaps becoming SVO under the influence of Spanish. Kamsá is dependent-27marking, with possessors being marked morphologically rather than the thing possessed. The
language also exhibits agreement, with adjectives agreeing with nouns in class, number, and
sometimes case. Oblique phrases tend to follow the subject of the clause and can precede or
follow the verb. Negators almost always precede verbs. Kamsá has mostly postpositions,
although it also has some prepositions that it has borrowed from Spanish. There are some
subordinators that are clause-initial and others that are clause final. In possessive constructions,
the possessor precedes the possessum (possessed) and is marked with a genitive case ending.
Adjectives can either follow or precede the nouns that they modify. Demonstratives and
numerals always precede nouns. Kamsá may be considered a pro-drop language, in that an overt
subject is not a necessary syntactic element.
Kamsá has nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment. In the third person, S and
A (not O) trigger verbal agreement. There can be also object marking on verbs, mainly for first
and second person objects. When the verb is ditransitive, if the goal is first or second person, it is
marked on the verb (not the theme). Kamsá has a strange characteristic of having dual marking
when there is a transitive sentence with an animate agent and patient. This could be polysemy.
There is wh-movement for questions: question words always come at the beginning of the
clause. Polar (‘yes/no’) questions do not necessitate any change in word order, and no special
particle is needed, although the tag aiñ o ndoñ ‘yes or no’ is commonly added to the end of the
question with a difference in intonation. Comparatives and superlatives are formed with the
Spanish loanword más ‘more’. Both nouns and adjectives can function as predicate
complements, either without a copula or with an inflected ‘be’ verb.
1.6.4Kamsá compared with Andean languages
Adelaar (2008) states that it “has been a common practice among linguists working onSouth American languages to make an intuitive distinction between ‘Amazonian’ and ‘Andean’
languages on the assumption that there would be two different language types corresponding to
these labels.” He proposes many traits that Andean languages tend to have (and many traits that
Andean languages lack). Here I discuss 20 of the traits that he suggests and explore whether
Kamsá fits or does not fit the typological expectations of this proposed Sprachbund. These areal
features are often tendencies.","[39, 40, 41]"

The ablative is the case for motion away from. This is, of course, used most often for
places, but it can be used for other nouns, as well, including animate nouns. Like the other cases,
when it is used with an animate noun, the marker -bi precedes the ablative. The ablative seems to
be a composite of the locative -ok with -an (which is not a marker, as far as I know). In (61a), tja
‘mountain’ has the ablative marker okan and in (61b) yebn ‘house’ has the ablative marker,
ending in -ok-an. In (61c), bata has the ablative marker -ok-an following the animate marker -bi.

the ablative, it does not become chatjokokan (adding -okan to chatjok) but rather chatjok.
Perhaps the ablative is a composite of locative and -an.

Kamsá nouns have suffixes that are somewhere between case markers and postpositions.
They do not seem like true case markers because they do not differentiate between subjects and
objects, yet they are not really postpositions because many of them are phonologically part of the85noun. Also, some of them function with other adpositions or special verbs that take a certain
case, much like cases do typologically. Some of the cases also require an animacy marker bi- for
animate nouns preceding the case, namely the benefactive, allative, locative and ablative. The
comitative perhaps comes from the instrumental but underwent a phonological change. The
genitive is the only case that is the same for animate and inanimate nouns, always -be.
Postpositions are discussed in 8.4.
The noun cases are shown in the Figure 3.5 below.

Verbal morphology
4.1Introduction
Kamsá verbs exhibit intricate morphology, with multiple prefixes and suffixes that indexperson and number for subjects and objects and indicate tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality
for events and states. This introduction summarizes the important phenomena of Kamsá verbal
morphology discussed in more detail in the following sections.
Kamsá verbs reflect a nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment: the person
marking for the single argument (the subject) of an intransitive verb matches the person marking
for the more agentive argument (the subject) of a transitive verb, whereas the marking for the
more patientive argument (the object) is different. Subject marking is obligatory in Kamsá, as is
object marking for first and second person objects.
In verbs that do not exhibit any object marking, the first verbal prefix is usually a subject
marker, with all other prefixes following this prefix and preceding the stem. There are some
exceptions, however, such as the emphatic prefix kwa- and the perfective marker t-, both of
which may precede the subject prefix. When a transitive verb exhibits overt object marking (that
is, in verbs with first or second person objects), the object marker is the first prefix on the verb,
followed by the subject marker, and then followed by all other prefixes and the stem.
This introductory section summarizes the different morphemes that Kamsá verbs can
have, all of which are discussed in more depth in the rest of this chapter.
A verb consists minimally either of a root plus inflectional morphology or a root with the
prefix j- and the suffix -an or -am. A root can never appear alone. Some examples of verb roots
are the following. The elicitation forms always have j- and -an, thus I write them as such here.
As seen in these examples, verb roots can start with /a/, /o/, or /w/.
j-abwamiy-an ‘buy’
j-achway-an ‘greet’
j-alants-an ‘dance’
j-amn-an ‘be’
j-as-an ‘eat’
j-ayan-an ‘say’87j-otbem-an ‘sit’
j-owen-an ‘hear’
j-oyebwambay-an ‘speak’
j-wabw-an ‘cook’
j-wabwem-an ‘write’
j-washaby-an ‘wash clothes’
While all person (subject and object) and TAME (tense, aspect, mood, evidentiality)
prefixes precede the root, there are a few suffixes that can appear on a root as well. Some
prefixes are portmanteau, simultaneously encoding multiple grammatical categories, such as both
person and tense or both tense and aspect. All inflected verbs are marked for both person and
number.
Verbs also exhibit TAM marking. There are many prefixes that combine with each other
for different tenses and aspects. In this chapter, I discuss all of the various morphemes that can
occur on verbs. First, I discuss person and number subject marking (4.2) then person and number
for object marking (4.3). In 4.4, I discuss the different tense, aspect, mood, and negation
prefixes. In 4.5, I discuss evidentiality, followed by reciprocal marking in 4.6. In 4.7, I discuss
the imperative form m-, and in 4.8 I show the intensifying prefix kwa-. The last sections are
dedicated to suffixes.
4.2Person and number: subject marking
Verbs can be marked to index both subjects and objects. This section illustrates thesubject marker morphology on verbs that indexes the person and/or number of the referent. The
subject marker is usually the first prefix on the verb, farthest from the stem, although there are a
few prefixes that can precede it, such as the prefix kwa- ‘truly’, discussed in 4.8.
Figure 4.1 (on the following page) shows the different verbal prefixes that mark the
person and number of the subject. In the table, I include the pronouns for each person/number.
These prefixes typically precede the TAM markers. For some tenses/aspects, the person marker
is different, as discussed below.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101]"

8.3.8Verbs that take case-marked objects
Some verbs, which on semantic grounds seem very much to be transitive, neverthelessco-occur with nouns (i.e., objects) marked by an oblique case. Such verbs could perhaps be
analyzed as intransitive, but with an argument structure that includes an oblique-marked nominal
argument. Alternatively, they can be analyzed as transitive, but with a (lexically determined)
stipulated selectional restriction that their direct-object arguments must be marked as oblique
NPs. The verb jwajabwachan ‘help’, for example, takes a allative-marked NP as its object. In
(33), the object of jwajabwachan ‘help’ is patronang ‘owners’, here marked with the allative
suffix -bi-oy.

Postpositional phrases in Kamsá consist of a noun followed by a postposition. Often casemarkers are also present: case markers can occur on the postposition itself, on the noun, or on
both the postposition and the noun. In (34a), the postposition tsëntsa ‘middle’ follows the noun
tsa ‘room’ and tsëntsa has the locative marker -k. Similarly, in (34b) tsëntsa has the case marker
210-k and the NP preceding it, chëng ‘3PL’, has the genitive marker -be. In (34c) the third person
singular pronoun cha has the genitive marker -be when it precedes bekonan ‘close’. An
alternative analysis is that these are not postpositions, but rather nouns. In (34d) the tsëntsak is
used nominally without any other noun (i.e. just ‘in the middle’ not ‘in the middle of the room’).
Another analysis is that these are compound nouns, not postpositions.

8.5Prepositional phrases
Although Kamsá normally employs postpositions, it has borrowed some prepositionsfrom Spanish. There are no native prepositions in the language (only postpositions), but the
Spanish prepositions are very common now. In (35a), the preposition sin ‘without’ (from
Spanish sin ‘without’) precedes the noun tamo ‘salt’. Nouns governed by the loan preposition sin
take the instrumental case marker -k, as does tamo ‘salt’ below. If the preposition sin were not
present in this sentence, then the phrase would mean ‘with salt’, as illustrated in (35b).
It is interesting to note that the language has postpositions, and that all subordinators go
at the end of clauses, such as the general subordinator -as and ora ‘when’, but that it has started
borrowing prepositions, and subordinators that go at the beginning of clauses (like ante ‘before’),
so now you can have a mix of things going at the end of phrases and clauses and at the beginning
211of verbs and clauses. Furthermore, it is possible that adpositions and subordinators borrowed
from Spanish earlier (maybe several centuries ago) became postpositions or clause final
subordinators, such as ora ‘when’ from Spanish hora ‘time, hour’, whereas recent borrowings
became prepositions or clause initial subordinators.

In (36a) another common preposition. asta ‘until’ (from Spanish hasta ‘until’), precedes
bastok ‘Pasto (a city near Sibundoy)’. This preposition can have a noun or an infinitive object;
when it takes an infinitive, it is always an uninflected. In (36a) asta bastok means ‘until Pasto’. It
is unclear whether there is case marking on bastok because, like many place names, the
unmarked form is already locative (such as bogotok ‘Bogotá’; tabanok ‘Sibundoy’ and chatjok
‘Mocoa’). In (36b) asta ‘until’ is the preposition and the infinitive belongs to the prepositional
phrase. The verb jwenatjëmb ‘disappear’ is not inflected for person, number, or TAM. In (36c)
asta precedes shachna ‘five’, which is used substantively and has the plural marker -ëng.

parejo ‘similar, equal, close, next to’. It is interesting because its meaning has shifted from the
Spanish meaning mostly as an adjective to become a preposition. Its noun has a case marker:
commitative for animate nouns and instrumental for inanimate nouns. In (37a) parej
enuntëngaftaka means ‘together with (her) friends’ where enuntëng ‘friends’ has the comitative
marker -aftak. In (37b) parej twambianak means ‘together with that of the hen’ (meaning the
brother discarded the chili along with the piece of hen). Note that in (37b) the noun has the
ablative marker to show source; it does not have -bi even though it’s an animal (and living
animals are animate) because in this sense it is food; and it does not show any object marking.

Simple clauses (monoclausal sentences)
9.1Introduction
In this chapter, I provide an overview of clause-level syntax in Kamsá, a clause beingminimally a verb and a subject (expressed or not expressed). Because verbs are marked for
person and number, a noun or pronoun is not obligatory, thus a clause could be simply a verb.
First I discuss clauses (9.2) including intransitive (9.2.1), predicative (9.2.2), then transitive
clauses (9.2.3) and clauses with complements (9.2.4). In (9.2.5) I discuss clauses with obliques
and in (9.2.6) I discuss ditransitive clauses. In (9.3) I discuss negation and in (9.4) I discuss
comparatives and superlatives. (9.5) covers imperatives and (9.6) describes interrogatives.
Indexing on the verb clearly shows that the system is nominative-accusative: subjects of
transitive verbs have the same morphemes as subjects of intransitives, both contrasting with the
marking of objects of transitives. NPs and personal pronouns are not marked in any way for
Agent or Patient (see 3.3.3 on noun cases). As seen in the following examples, although the
nouns and pronouns do not have any morphology for case, the verbal morphology is
nominative/accusative.

3SG.PST-EVI-VBLZ-goThe following sections cover intransitive clasues (9.2.1), predicative clasues (9.2.2),
transitive clauses (9.2.3), clauses with complements (9.2.4), clauses with obliques (9.2.5), and
ditransitive clauses (9.2.6).
9.2.1Intransitive clauses
In intransitive sentences, the word order is almost always SV, whether the subject is apronoun or a noun. In (2a) the verb j-ashjajna ‘arrive’ is preceded by bobonts-ënga ‘young men’.
In (2b) j-abokna ‘leave’ is preceded by oso ‘bear’. In (2c) j-abostero ‘lie’ is preceded by the first
person singular pronoun ats̈ whereas in (2d) j-amanan ‘sleep’ doesn’t have any overt subject, but
the prefix së- on the verb shows that it is first person singular. In (2e) j-asapten ‘rain’ is inflected
as third person singular. Although the subject usually precedes the verb, in (2f) the subject kanÿe
baká wabon ‘one horrible spirit’ follows the verb jashjango ‘arrive’. It is possible that in
intransitive sentences the subject is more likely to follow the verb if it is heavier as in (2f) in
which the subject is kanÿe baká wabon bachnaj kapuchinká pormaná ‘one horrible spirit dressed
as a priest’, but more research is needed.

‘A horrible spirit, dressed as a capuchin priest, arrived.’ (Chindoy)9.2.2Predicative with jamnan ‘be’porma-ná
dressed-TOPPredicative clauses are formed with j-amn-an ‘be’. It is inflected in the same way as other
Kamsá verbs. The word order is flexible. In (3a) tsbwanach ‘leaf’ is bëts ‘big’. Note that the
adjective agrees with the class of the noun. In (3b) santopes ‘centipede’ is a botaman shembasa
‘beautiful woman’. In (3c) j-amn-an ‘be’ is used for location yebën-ents̈ ‘in the house’. Similarly
in (3d) jamnan is used for location chents̈ ‘there’ and is marked with the third person plural
prefix mo- to agree with the plural subject. In (3d-f) other persons are shown. In (3g) the
personal pronoun is not used, but the verbal inflection shows that it is second person plural,
indicated by s̈mo-.
The verb j-amn-an is inflected for TAM in addition to person and number. In (3a) it has
the marker nd- to show a habitual state, whereas in (3b) it is distant past because it is in a
traditional story. In addition, the adjectives agree with the nouns or pronouns. In (3a) the216adjective agrees with the class of the noun and in (3f) and (3g) wayan ‘hated’ agrees with ‘you
all’ and ‘we’ in number, shown by the plural marker -ëng.

1SG-HAB-beTransitive clauses have very free word order, so much so that some have asserted that
Kamsá has no dominant word order (Fabre 2001). In his typological sketch of Kamsá, Fabre says217that out of one hundred instances he found a slight predominance of VERB + PATIENT (56%).
Most AGENT NPs appear first, but the inverse order is not rare either (Fabre 2001).
The following examples show various options for word order. In (4a) and (4b) the word
order is SVO and in (4c) and (4d) it is SOV.

birdClauses where the verb has a complement tend to have the following word order:
subject - verb - complement.
If the complement has an object, that object precedes the verbal complement. In (5a) the verb jonts̈á ‘begin’ has the complement j-akwentan ‘tell’. The oblique shachbuyek ‘with tears’
precedes both the verb and the complement. In (5b) and (5c), intransitive verbs have verbal
complements. In (5d) j-oben ‘be able to’ has a complement, and in (5e) j-anpochoká ‘stop’. The
word order in (5e) is different, perhaps because it is part of a subordinate clause. The verbs jonts̈á ‘begin’, j-oben ‘be able to’ and j-anpochoká ‘stop’ all commonly take complements. The
verb in the complement is almost always non-finite, nominal in form.","[222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"
"71There is no core argument case marking in the language (i.e. no overt marking for
nominative and accusative). There are various semantic case markers which are oblique markers
distinct from postpositions in that they are not separate words: they are bound morphemes and
they fulfill various semantic functions to oblique case markers. By ""case"" I do not mean any
theoretical definition of 'Case', but rather just a description of oblique marking in the language.
3.3.3.1 Unmarked case
In Kamsá, A, S, and O do not have any overt case marking. The noun stem appears alone
without any affixes. Furthermore, in ditransitives, neither the O or the Goal has any marking.
In (33a) the A (agent) batá ‘aunt’ has no suffix. In (33b) batá is the P (direct object) and
has no suffix. In (33c) batá ‘aunt’ is the S (subject of the intransitive sentence) and has no affix.
Finally, in (33d), batá is a recipient object of the ditransitive verb and has no case-marking
suffix. Note that the other object sana ‘food’ also has no case marking.

Each pronoun in Kamsá can take a variety of case markers, all of which are suffixes, andpostpositions. They are the same as the case markers discussed in Chapter 2.2.3, and the case
markers that require the animate marker -bi for animate nouns, are the same for pronouns. Thus,
the allative and benefactive both require -bi, whereas the genitive -be does not, and the
comitative is -abtak, perhaps deriving from -bi + -ak. Figure 5.2 summarizes the pronoun forms
of the genitive, allative, benefactive, and comitative.

In addition to case markers, pronouns can also have the topic marker/discourse marker=na, as seen above, the intensifier prefix kach-, and evaluatives.
Pronouns can bear the intensifier prefix; it adds extra emphasis to the pronoun. In (8) the
second singular pronoun ak has the prefix kach and the genitive suffix -be.

Sometimes pronouns can take evaluatives, although this is very rare and is perhaps onlydone for narrative or poetic reasons. In (9), the first person plural pronoun bëng has the suffix jem, an evaluative suffix used for poor things. Note that there is an additional plural marker, even
though bëng is already plural.

5.4Reciprocal pronouns
Kamsá does not seem to have reciprocal pronouns. Rather, the reciprocity is marked onthe verb with the prefix en- The verb ‘to say’ takes different morphemes depending on whether
there is a hearer or whether it is mutual as seen in (11): j-ayanan is less transitive, while jauyanan, with the /u/ means ‘to tell someone’, and j-enyanan, with /en/ means that the telling is
reciprocal, telling each other. This is discussed more in 4.6.
(11)jayanan ‘say’
jauyanan ‘tell someone’
jenyanan ‘tell each other’
The following two examples show the verb j-ayanan ‘to say’ as a reciprocal and with ahearer. In (12a) the verb has the reciprocal marker en-, and in (12b), the verb has the marker auto show that there is a hearer. The hearer is marked with the allative marker -bioy.

5.5Determiners
This section discusses the determiners, both articles and demonstratives.
Kamsá has one article, ch, which is probably related to the third person singular pronouncha. It is used for definiteness/specificity but more research is needed. The language has one144main demonstrative kem, which basically means ‘this’. Both ch and kem can modify animate and
inanimate nouns, although ch is used very often with animate nouns and not so often with
inanimate nouns. Also, ch is used more when the noun is the subject (which is, of course, related
to the previous observation). kem can also be used for both animate and inanimate nouns. Both
ch and kem, when part of an NP, come at the beginning, regardless of the order of the other
words in the NP and they can both stand alone, not as part of a larger NP. When the determiners
are part of an NP, they do show any overt marking of agreement with the noun, but if they stand
alone, they agree with their referent/antecedent in class, and sometimes in case and/or number. In
addition to ch and kem, there is also kanÿe ‘one’ and inÿa ‘other’ that I include in this section
because they behave similarly to ch and kem, also occurring at the beginning of an NP and
agreeing with their referent/antecedent when they stand alone. Himmelmann uses the following
two criteria to distinguish between articles and demonstratives:
- articles occur only in nominal expressions, whereas demonstratives may appear as pronouns,
adverbials, predicates or adnominal modifiers;
- within the nominal expressions articles occupy a fixed position, either consistently to the left or
to the right of the noun, whereas demonstratives may occur on either side of the noun in many
languages. (Himmelmann 2001:832)
Kamsá does not seem to have these distinctions. All determiners must go at the beginning
of the NP when they’re part of the NP, and they can all stand alone. That being said, it is rare for
ch to stand alone; ch is extremely frequent as part of an NP, but it rarely stands alone.
The four determiners discussed in this chapter are presented in Figure 5.3.

Determiners can modify animate objects, inanimate subjects, and inanimate objects, as
well. In (14a), the definite article ch is used with bëshatema ‘little door’. In (14b) kanÿe ‘one’ is

regardless of the order of other elements of the NP. In (15a), the definite article ch is at the
beginning of the NP, followed by satkakan ‘perforated’ derived from the verb jasatkan
‘perforate’. The noun kwashaj ‘gourd’ follows the adjective. In (15b), a noun with the genitive

A verb phrase can consist of just a verb (without any other constituents) as seen in (20a),where the verb jwenatjëmban ‘disappear’ is marked for person, number, and TAM. The prefix
tën- ‘3SG’ indexes the third person singular subject washëntsayá ‘sower’. There is no object,
oblique, adverb, or postposition within the VP. In (20a), the verb phrase contains nothing but a
verb, and the object of the verb that is not present as a full noun is indicated by a crossreferencing prefix on the verb (k- ‘2SG)’. The prefix b- (which follows the object marker) indexes
a first person singular subject; and the prefix at- marks the mood of the verb as irrealis.

8.3.2VPs with a direct object
Verb phrases can have expressed direct objects. As there is no case marking on anynominals (including pronouns) to indicate their role as subject or (direct) object in Kamsá, there
is no morphological difference between subjects and objects. Also, because the word order in
Kamsá is very free, it is generally not possible to use word order to discern which NP is the
subject and which is the object in a transitive clause. In (21), there is no expressed subject; the
NP mongoj ‘deer’ is the direct object of the verb. There is no extra morphology on mongoj to
indicate what its role in the sentence is.
(21)Bojashbwá mongoj.

‘He hunted a deer.’ (Chindoy 60:2)204Pronouns can also serve as objects in a verb phrase. They are not marked any differently
from full NP direct objects. In (22a). the object is ats̈ ‘1SG’. Note that the verb agrees with ats̈ in
person and number. The noun ndëts̈-be ‘rock’ is marked with an instrumental case marker. In
(2b), the subject is the first person singular pronoun ats̈. When comparing of (22b) in which ats̈
‘1SG’ is the subject of a transitive clause with (22a) in which ats̈ ‘1SG’ is the object, it can be
seen that the form of the pronoun is the same regardless of whether it is serving as subject or as
object. In (22c), ats̈ ‘1SG’ is the subject of the sentence and has the topic marker -na. When a
pronoun is the direct object of a verb, it does not have to be expressed, as seen in example (20b)
above, in which the verbal prefix k- ‘2SG’ shows that the object is second person singular.

Some other parts of speech can also serve as objects within VPs. In (23), the
demonstrative mwa is the object of the imperative form of the verb jolempia ‘clean’ (from
Spanish limpiar ‘clean’) and the numeral kanÿe ‘one’ is the object of the verb jasan ‘eat’.

Verb phrases can also contain obliques—that is, NPs that are marked with case-markedsuffixes but do not play the role of core arguments (subject, object, or object of a distransitive) of
the verb. In (24a) bobonts ‘young man’ bears the allative marker -bioy. In (24b), ndweñang
‘owners’ has the benefactive marker. (Note that ndweñ ‘owner’ is from Spanish dueño ‘owner’;
the initial alveolar stop is prenasalized, following the phonology of Kamsá, imposed by some
speakers on Spanish loan words as well). In (24c), bata ‘aunt’ has the locative marker -bioka.
None of these verb phrases has an expressed direct object.

"10An important concept in Kamsá is shinÿak ‘hearth’, the large fire kept in the traditional
house or outdoor kitchen. Many Kamsás see this word as being connected to the words in ‘fire’
and shinÿe ‘sun’, and thus see the three concepts as related. More pragmatically, the shinÿak is
used to make chicha, which needs to be cooked in a cauldron over a large fire, meaning it cannot
be made on a modern stove. In the past, people would make meals on the fire and sit around the
shinÿak, telling stories.
There are several aspects of Kamsá culture that seem to come from lowland groups,
namely yagé, the jaguar as a symbol, and maloca. The plants used to make yagé do not appear to
be native to Sibundoy, so the practice is presumably from lowlands groups, whose rainforest
environment contains the necessary plants. It is not clear how long yagé has been used by the
Kamsá, but it is of course possible that there has been a very long tradition of trade and cultural
transmission. It is also interesting to note that, despite living at a high altitude, the Kamsá do not
use coca, which is rather common among other Andean groups. It would be interesting to look
for Kamsá influence on lowland groups, such as the Siona and Kofán.
Taitas (‘male elders’) sometimes wear elaborate necklaces with beaded jaguars (called
‘tigers’) and artisans make jaguar masks. There is also a type of yagé called ‘jaguar’. The Kamsá
words for ‘jaguar’ and ‘tiger’ are borrowed for Spanish. Reichel-Dolmatoff (1975), known as the
father of Colombian anthropology, notes that many highland groups borrowed the symbol of the
jaguar from lowland groups. This is in part assumed because the species is not found in the
highlands, although it isn’t impossible that there were jaguars in the area. The maloca,
(traditional long house) also seems to be from lowland groups mainly because its design is suited
for hot climates. This is speculation on my part.
1.2.3Relationship to other languages / classification attempts
Kamsá is a language isolate. There have been several attempts to group it with otherlanguage families, mainly Chibchan, but there is no reliable evidence that it is related to other
languages. See Campbell 2012 for a survey of larger-scale though mostly unaccepted proposals
of distant genetic relationships involving languages in South America. There have also been
suggestions that it is related to the language of the Quillacinga, whose ancestral homeland is
around what is now the city of Pasto. Although the Quillacinga people still exist, their language11has been extinct for centuries and they now only speak Spanish. There are no records of what
their language was like. There are several theories about what language they spoke: Kamsá,
something related to Kamsá, something in the Chibchan family, or something in the Quechuan
family. It is of course impossible to classify their language, since there is no record of it.
Likewise, Kamsá could theoretically be related to whatever language was once spoken by the
Mocoa people (a group who once lived in the area of the current city of Mocoa), but their
language is also unknown to us. The extant languages geographically closest to Kamsá are: Inga
(Quechuan), Kofán (isolate), Siona (Tukano), Awa Pit (Barbacoan), and Koreguaje (Tukano).
Future research is needed to see if any of these languages have had lexical or structural
influences on Kamsá.
1.2.4Borrowing
Kamsá has a long tradition of lexical borrowed from both Spanish and Inga. Morerecently, as the language has come to be spoken less and less, it has become more and more
influenced by Spanish, both lexically and syntactically. This section focuses more on the older
borrowings, especially those forms that have been fully integrated into Kamsá phonotactics or
have undergone sound changes that have somewhat obscured their non-Kamsá etymologies. The
words considered in this section are—largely—considered by native speakers to be “Kamsá”
(regardless of their origins) and they are used commonly in traditional stories, ceremonial
speech, and other speech registers that may be considered “pure” or “traditional”. Thus, these
are—both etically (on the grounds of phonotactics and morphology) and emically (on the
grounds of speaker identification of Kamsá-ness)—fully integrated loanwords as opposed to
instances of code-switching or language loss.
One obvious semantic domain for borrowing includes vocabulary for fauna, flora,
cultural objects and concepts that did not exist before the arrival of the Spanish. Examples
include: ral ‘money’ (from Spanish real, the old Spanish currency), naranjabe ‘orange’ (from
Spanish naranja ‘orange’), and jatrabaja ‘work’ (from Spanish trabajar ‘work’). All three of
these words exhibit the borrowed phoneme /r/, which suggests that the forms are foreign.
Nevertheless, their integration into Kamsá can be shown both phonologically and
morphologically. First, ral ‘money’ has undergone a phonological reduction, from the disyllabic12form re.al to the current monosyllabic ral (the fact that the term real is no longer used in local
Colombian Spanish can obscure the word’s etymology). Second, the from naranjabe ‘orange’
shows a morphological change, having received the noun classifier associated with round
objects, -be (3.2.2). Finally, jatrabaja has undergone the phonological change of the loss of a
final consonant; furthermore, it reveals Kamsá verbal morphology by exhibiting the non-finite
verb marker j(a)- (4), as well as being able to receive TAM morphology.
Almost all conjunctions (10.2) in Kamsá are borrowed from Spanish, including: o ‘or’
(from Spanish o); i ‘and’ (from Spanish y); pero ‘but’ (from Spanish pero); porke ‘because’
(from Spanish porque); maske ‘although’ (from Spanish más que ‘more than’); and ni ‘neither,
nor’ (from Spanish ni). Other borrowed basic function-like words include mas ‘more’ (from
Spanish más); mejor ‘better’ (from Spanish mejor); and peor ‘bad’ (from Spanish peor ‘worse’).
These are all discussed in 10.2 and 9.4.
Because the Catholic missionaries were the only people speaking Spanish in Sibundoy
until the 1950s (Fabre 2001:2), much of the older Spanish vocabulary that has been borrowed
into Kamsá reflects the varieties of Spanish used by the them. Fabre states: “This explains why
the Spanish layer we can detect in Kamsá and Inga is so replete with quaintly old-fashioned
church Spanish” (Fabre 2001:2). Some examples are the following: parla ‘speak’ (from parlar, a
now obsolete Spanish word for ‘speak’, cf. standard hablar); ndeombre ‘truly’ (from Spanish de
hombre loosely, ‘by my word’); andela warda ‘God protect you’ (from Spanish dios le guarde,
‘God preserve you’), dioslepay ‘thank you’ (from (que) dios le pague ‘may God pay you’, cf.
standard gracias).
Along with vocabulary, Kamsá has borrowed some phonology from Spanish as well
(2.2.2.7). The most obvious loan phoneme is /r/, some examples of which were seen above.
Other examples include rat ‘bit, while’ (from Spanish rato ‘while’) and mor ‘now’ (from
Spanish ahora ‘now’ or, alternatively, from *mwa-hora ‘this hour’, from Kamsá mwa ‘that’ plus
Spanish hora ‘hour’).
Kamsá’s traditional phoneme inventory also lacked a plain (non-prenasalized) voiced
alveolar /d/, and many older Spanish words that contained /d/ have been borrowed into Kamsá
with either /nd/ or /ndʒ/ (written in orthography used here as <nd> and <nÿ>, respectively).
Examples of Spanish words with *d that have been borrowed with phonological changes into13Kamsá are: nÿios or ndios or nÿios̈ ‘god’ (from Spanish dios ‘god’); ndeolpe ‘suddenly’ from de
golpe ‘suddenly’; and nderado ‘maybe’ possibly from *de raro.
Many words borrowed from Spanish have changed in meaning, sometimes even
functioning as different parts of speech in Kamsá than in Spanish. Loanwords are pointed out
throughout the dissertation as well as their change in meaning and/or part of speech. Two brief
examples of loanwords that have taken on new meaning in Kamsá are ora ‘when’ and parej
‘with’. First, ora ‘when’ comes from the Spanish nouns hora ‘hour, time, when’, but has become
a subordinator for temporal clauses, thus shifting both in meaning and in function (10.3.3).
Similarly, parej ‘with’ from the Spanish adjective parejo ‘equal to, level with, similar to’
functions in Kamsá as a preposition, not as a adjective.
Many Spanish words have found new meanings in ceremonial speech, the register of
Kamsá that is used for many formal situations, such as greetings in the cabildo, and for Catholic
sacraments, such as baptisms and confirmations. Haydee Seijas (1969:65), who conducted
anthropological fieldwork in Sibundoy in the 1960s, refers to this type of speech as the lengua de
los antiguos or “relación speech”. She reports that most people are not fluent in this speech,
which consists of set words and phrases and are used by the governor in his Sunday address to
the Kamsá people and by others as a means of showing politeness. The following example, the
beginning of a formal greeting, shows the Spanish influence, with three out of the four words
coming from Spanish (the possessive pronoun ats̈be ‘my’ is the only fully native Kamsá word).
The verb, although derived from Spanish, exhibits Kamsá verbal morphology:
(1)Primermente ats̈be dios chas̈pasentsia …
primermente ats̈-be
dios cha-s̈-pasentsia
first
1SG-GEN
god
COND-1SG-forgive
‘First may god forgive me…’ (Chindoy 28:5) (primermente from Spanish primeramente
‘firstly’, dios from Spanish dios ‘God’, pasentsia from Spanish paciencia ‘patience’)
Much of the ‘formal’ speech relates to the Catholic church, which we might expect tohave a lot of Spanish not because it’s formal but because it involves Catholic rituals and
ceremonies, where they borrowed the words along with the rituals. There is also non-religious
formal speech that uses Spanish, such as the petitioning for a girlfriend, mentioned above.
In addition to lexical borrowing, Kamsá has perhaps undergone structural changes under
influence from Spanish and Inga. Since Kamsá has no known relatives and since no early14documents representing the language are known, it is impossible to say with any certainty what
structural traits (if any) are due to influence from other languages. That said, it is possible that
the basic word order in Kamsá is becoming more SVO (due to influence from Spanish), and that
there is a trend toward using fewer adjectival verbs or null-copular constructions for predicate
adjectives, with a preference instead for copula-plus-adjective constructions (as in Spanish).
Fabre (Fabre 2001:3) suggests another influence from Spanish:
the redundant use of the same classifier, even with no intervening word between them,
strongly reminds of the Spanish number and gender agreement rules between the same two
parts of speech and sets Kamsá apart from classifier languages of Western Amazonia, where
classifiers are mostly used as an anaphoric device, there being no need of repeating the noun
to which they refer.
Kamsá and Inga have been in contact for at least five centuries. In the past, many Kamsá and
Inga were multilingual, speaking each other’s languages as well as Spanish. Today there are
older Kamsá (over 60) who know some Inga, and they often say that their fathers (and
sometimes mothers) were fluent in Inga. Borrowing from Inga needs to be investigated further,
but here I provide a few examples of Inga words in Kamsá. Some examples of Kamsá words that
Chindoy says are borrowed from Inga are as follows (the Kamsá and the Inga words have the
same meaning unless otherwise noted):
chisiajta ‘afternoon, all day’ < chisya
choros̈ ‘snail’ < churu
pats ‘one hundred’ < patsa
taytá ‘father’ < tayta
wambra ‘child’ < wampra;
wata ‘year’ < wata
yap(a) ‘a lot, very, much’ < yapa ‘a lot, very, much’.
Fabre suggests that the Kamsá’s determiner ch could be borrowed from Inga as well
because it has a cognate in most Quechuan languages (2001:3).
Words borrowed from Spanish and Inga have Kamsá morphology. Thus chagllufja ‘thin
cane or rod to measure work or construction of houses’ which comes from Inga chacla has the
Kamsá classifier -fja used for long, thin, things. The example of naranja-be ‘orange’ was seen
above, with -be ‘round-objects classifier. It should be noted that Kamsá classifiers are not
separable from the word. They are part of the root. Borrowed words may reflect other15morphological affixation as well, as for example trabajayá ‘worker’ which has the agentive -yá
on the Spanish-derived trabaja (from trabajar ‘to work’). The following sentence shows Kamsá
morphology on two verbs borrowed from Spanish: jakwenta ‘tell’ from contar and japasa
‘happen’ from pasar.

Kamsá is referred to variously in the literature by the following names: Camënts̈á,Camëntsëá, Camëntxá, Camsa, Camsá, Coche, Kamemtxa, Kamentsá, Kamëntsa, Kamënts̈á,
Kamsa, Kamsá, Kamse, Kamtsá, Mocoa, Sibundoy, and Sibundoy-Gaché. Other than the terms
Coche, Sibundoy, and Mocoa, these are all variants of Kamsá. The Kamsá people tend to
pronounce the name of their language as Kamënts̈á (in IPA [kamɨnˈtʂa]) or Kamënchá (in IPA
[kamɨnˈtʃa]). One commonly repeated etymology is from ka- (intensifier) and mwents̈ ‘here’,
meaning ‘right here’. It is not clear, however, what sound changes would have generated mënts̈á
from *mwents̈, with the labial glide *w being elided, and the front vowel *e becoming the central
vowel ë. The final -á, however, could perhaps be explained as a nominalizing suffix. Because
most English- and Spanish-language sources have referred to the language as either Kamsá or
Camsá, I have chosen to use that name as well, preferring <K> to <C> to match the overall
orthography used within this grammatical description (2.7). Most Kamsá seem to write
Kamënts̈á or Camënts̈á for the language.
Of the unrelated names that have been used to refer to the language, the name Sibundoy
derives simply from the location (town, municipality, and valley) where Kamsá is spoken. (In
some sources, the term Sibundoy is used to refer to the Kamsá and the Inga together.) It is
possible that the term Mocoa actually refers to a different tribe that may or may not have spoken
a different language. Mocoa is mentioned in some historical texts as being the name of a lowland
people, the people who perhaps lived where the city of Mocoa is currently located, on the edge
of the Amazon in the Putumayo department of Colombia. The source of the term Coche is
unclear as is the source of Gaché in Sibundoy-Gaché.
161.3Language ecology and language vitality
Kamsá is a severely endangered language based on UNESCO’s factors and the LEI(Language Endangerment Index). I estimate that there were fewer than 500 fluent speakers of
Kamsá in 2012, based on the current age of fluent speakers and the census data for different age
groups. My personal observation is that there are few, if any, fluent speakers of Kamsá younger
than 60 years old. Many ethnic Kamsás between the ages of 40 and 60 are semi-speakers (in that
they are able to have basic conversations and have good comprehension of fluent speech, but are
not themselves fluent speakers), but it is not known how many there are. According to the DANE
(National Administrative Department of Statistics) census in 2012, there were 499 Kamsá who
were 61 or older (2012). Thus, considering that only ethnic Kamsás older than 60 years old are
fluent speakers, I estimate that the speaker number is less than 500. This method of counting
speakers is problematic for several reasons. First, the most recent census was in 2012 (although
now, in 2018, they are conducting a census so there will be better numbers next year). Second,
the age groups in the census include all people 25-60, then those over 60. There isn’t a more
nuanced count of older people.
ONIC (Organizacion Nacional Indigena de Colombia, ‘National Indigenous
Organization of Colombia’) lists an ethnic population of 4,773 (2005). Thus, just slightly over 10
percent of the ethnic Kamsá population are fluent speakers of the language.
Ethnologue (2018 ??) claims that Kamsá has 4,000 speakers out of an ethnic population
of 4,770 and classifies Kamsá as “level 5: developing”, according to its EGIDS schema.
UNESCO claims 3,500 speakers and says that the language is definitely endangered (3 on its
scale) The Endangered Language Catalogue gives 4773 speakers, based on Crevels 2012.
1.3.1UNESCO’s nine factors
UNESCO uses nine factors to determine the endangerment of a language, most of whichare graded on a scale from 0 (“extinct” to 5 (“safe”). Following this system, I would classify
Kamsá as 2 (“severely endangered”). UNESCO, however, lists Kamsá as 3 “definitely
endangered”. The following is a description of how Kamsá fares according to each of the nine
UNESCO factors.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"
"30Kamsá does not have grammatical gender but it does have a class system for a subset of
nouns.
10: Case marking on nouns by suffixes or postpositions
“Case marking on noun phrases expressed by means of suffixes or postpositions is
common in Andean languages” (Adelaar 2008:29).
Kamsá nouns have case marking with nine cases. These all suffixes.
11: Accusative marking and/or disambiguating suffix indicating actor as opposed to unmarked
object
“Accusative case marking is found in several central Andean languages (Aymaran,
Quechuan, Barbacoan, Páez, also in the pre-Andean Jivaroan languages), but less so in the
northern Andes (cf. Constenla 1991) and in the south. Some northern languages, viz. Chimila,
Ika (both Chibchan) and Cholón, feature a disambiguating affix that indicates an actor in
opposition to an (unmarked) object” (Adelaar 2008:29).
Kamsá does not have accusative case marking; S, A, and O are unmarked. There is an
optional clitic =na, however, that possibly marks actors. It is discussed in 8.2.3.2.
12: No possessed/dispossessed roots
“The formal distinction between possessed and non-possessed roots is a wide-spread
phenomenon in Mesoamerica (Mayan, Uto-Aztecan) and in the eastern lowlands of South
America (Arawakan, Cariban, TupiGuaraní). It is nearly unknown in the Andean region, except
in the Arawakan languages” (Adelaar 2008:29).
Kamsá (like other Andean languages) does not display a formal distinction between
possessed and non-possessed roots.
13: Some have transitive/intransitive distinctions but most do not:
“However, in most of the central Andean languages (including Aymaran and Quechuan)
the transitive / intransitive distinction hardly plays a role” (Adelaar 2008:29). It is important to
note that this means that the verbs do not have transitive vs intransitive morphology, but objects
can still have accusative case.","[43, 44]"

benefactive -am. In (44b), bëng, the first person plural pronoun, has -byam.

proper nouns, as seen in (45), from a text about preparing spots in Hell for people from several
Colombian cities, including Popayan, Pasto, and Bogotá. Each noun is composed of the city76name, followed by the plural marker, followed by the animacy marker -bi, then finally the
benefactive suffix. Note that the case marker comes after the plural marker.

3.3.3.4 Instrumental
The instrumental case is -ak and has the additional allomorphs -k and -ek. When the noun
ends in a consonant, the form is always -ak. When a noun ends in a vowel, the form is that vowel
+ -k When a noun ends in the glide y, the form is -ek.
In (46a), when -ak is added to the root s̈knen ‘plate’ it becomes s̈knen-ak. When the noun
ends in a vowel, however, the root vowel remains. Thus tomo ‘salt’ with an instrumental ending
becomes tomok, not /*tomak/ nor /*tomoak/. Likewise, in an example where the noun ends in
/a/, the suffix is also /-k/ as seen in (46c) where tsëts̈a ‘aji’ becomes tsëts̈ak, not /*tsëts̈aak/ or
/*tsëts̈aɁak/. Finally, in (46d) the instrumental is seen on shachbuy ‘tear’ which ends in the glide
/y/. When -ak attaches to this noun, it becomes/ -ek/, perhaps because of phonetic reasons.

‘He started to tell (the story) with a tear…’ (Chindoy1 68.2)
In addition to the uses of the instrumental shown above, where it often shows the literal
item used to accomplish a task, it can be used as a more metaphorical instrument as in (46d)
above when the narrator is telling his story ‘with a tear’.
The instrumental can also be used for other idiomatic uses and with certain verbs, such as
the following example where the verb ‘to be full of’ takes the instrumental case. Note that there
are no postpositions or prepositions in this sentence, only the verb. Also note that although the
instrumental case is usually only found on inanimate common nouns, here it occurs on an
animate noun.

realized as /-k/.

'only toasted corn flour without salt' (Chindoy1 62.17)Although there are no native prepositions in Kamsá, it has borrowed some prepositions from
Spanish that have changed their meanings to become more grammatical. One example is parej
from Spanish pareja ‘pair, couple’. In Kamsá, it is used to mean ‘together with’ and takes the
instrumental case. In (49), parej is used with ibet ‘night’ to mean with each respective night
(paired with each respective night).

3SG=TOP

‘he only (spent) three days with their respective nights.’ (Chindoy1 67:1)78This phenomenon is interesting in determining if these suffixes are case or not because it
is one of the rare situations in Kamsá where the case suffix occurs with an additional adposition.
At the same time, it is problematic because both of the adpositions shown above are loan words
from Spanish.
The instrumental can occur on inanimate common nouns. It rarely occurs on proper
nouns, pronouns, or animate common nouns, probably due to semantic limitations, that these
things cannot normally be semantic instruments. In my data, this case mainly occurs with
inanimate nouns.
The instrumental case ending is very productive, though, and is used with loanwords. In
(50a) kuchiyo from Spanish cuchillo ‘knife’ has the instrumental suffix -k. The second example
(50b) is even more interesting in that the case ending -ak appears on the loan word asukar
‘sugar’ (from Spanish azúcar) and has the word sin (also from Spanish) ‘without’.

3.3.3.5 Comitative
The comitative in Kamsá is for accompaniment and only applies to animate nouns. The
form is -abtak (often pronounced as /-aftak/) and the initial vowel of this affix is deleted when
the noun ends in a vowel. In (51a), kes̈ ‘dog’ takes the suffix -abtak, with the first /a/ maintained;
however, in (51b), batá ‘aunt’ ends in a vowel; thus batá + abtak becomes bata-btak.

animate nouns must be preceded by -bi as shown above with the benefactive. Thus, it is possible
that the comitative was noun + bi + ak and underwent some phonological or phonetic changes.
For clarity the two cases are compared:
comitative: kes̈-abtak ‘with the dog’
instrumental: s̈knen-ak ‘with the plate’
Proper nouns can have the comitative marker as seen in (52a) where Carmen, has -abtak.
All personal pronouns can also take -abtak. One example is shown in (52b) where -ak, the
second singular pronoun, has the suffix -abtak. It is also productive and is attached to loan
words. In (52c), -abtak is added to madrang ‘nuns’ a loan word from Spanish madre ‘mother’.
Note that the word madgra-ng is plural, and that the comitative marker comes after the plural
marker.

The locative is used for the location of something. For inanimate nouns, it is formed by
adding -ok to the root of the noun. In (53a) yebn becomes yebnok and in (53b) beti ‘tree’
becomes betyok.

Adjectives
6.1Introduction
Adjectives in Kamsá are an open class of words. I define them as being words that canagree with nouns in class, number, and sometimes evaluatives and/or case; that can be
intensified; and can take comparative degrees. Their typical functions are to modify
nouns/nominals (attributive adjectives, e.g. the big dog) and as adjectival predicate complements
(e.g. the dog is big). Their defining criteria in my analysis is their ability agree with nouns
because nouns cannot agree with other nouns.
An adjective can agree with a noun that it modifies in class, number, and evaluative
marking. Adjectives often take the case marker for a noun phrase, and they can sometimes agree
with a noun in case. Adjectives can be intensified with adverbs such as bien ‘very’ and yap
‘very, much’. Adjectives can also take comparatives.
The following examples show the morphology that adjectives have when agreeing with
nouns. This chapter discusses this morphology in greater depth. In (1b) the adjective bwangan
‘red’ agrees with chembalbe ‘tree tomato’ with the class marker -be. In (1c) bwangan ‘red’
agrees with the plural noun s̈lofts̈ëng with the plural marker -ang. In (1d) stjnëj ‘hair’ has the
diminutive marker -tem, as does the adjective ftseng ‘black’ that agrees with it. In (1e) both the
noun chembalbe ‘tree tomato’ and bochan ‘ripe’ have the instrumental case marker -k. In
addition, the adjective bochan agrees with chembal-be in class, as shown by the suffix -be. In
(1f) the adjective is intensified with yap. Finally, in (1g) an adjective is used in a comparative
construction with mas ‘more’. These qualities of adjectives are discussed further in the following
sections of this chapter.

Adjectives tend to end in /a/, /o/, or /á/. Adjectives that end in /o/ or /a/ lose this finalvowel when they precede the noun, but adjectives ending in the stressed vowel /á/ do not lose the
final vowel. In Figure 6.1 botamana ‘beautiful’ is botamán when preceding a noun and
botamana when following the noun or standing alone after the verb. i-nd-emën is the third
singular present form of j-amnan ‘be’.
botamán tobias̈
tobias̈ botamana

tobias̈ botamana indemën‘beautiful girl’

‘(the) girl is beautiful’
‘(the) girl is beautiful’
Figure 6.1 Noun/adjective orderLikewise, adjectives that end in /o/ lose the /o/ when they precedes the noun. betsko ’fast’
can be betsk and podesko ’ugly’ can be podesk when preceding a noun. Adjectives that end in
151stressed /á/ cannot lose the vowel regardless of the position of the adjective. ‘Fat dog’ can be
either oboná kes̈ (fat dog) or kes̈ oboná (dog fat), but not *obon kes̈.
Figure 6.2 shows some common adjectives in the language.

Adjectives agree with the noun they modify. Class agreement is obligatory (unless theadjective preceeds the noun), while number, case, and evaluative marking are optional.
Adjectives agree with nouns even if the noun is not overt in the clause.
6.3.1Plural marking on adjectives
Adjectives can have plural markers and dual markers. Number agreement is notobligatory. In (2a) the adjective botamana ‘beautiful’ has the plural marker -ëng to agree with
the plural noun yebnëng ‘houses’. In (2b) bën ‘tall’ has the plural marker -ang to agree with the
plural pronoun bëng ‘we (pl)’. In (2c) there are two adjectives bëts ‘big’ and basa ‘small’ both
agreeing with the plural pronoun chëng ‘they’.

?-beAs discussed in 3.2, there is a subset of nouns in Kamsá that has class markers.
Adjectives that agree with nouns that have class markers must bear these class markers. As seen
in (3a) the adjective gobshn ‘green’ has the class marker -be to agree with the noun shemne-be
‘egg’. In (3b) there are two adjectives, botamana ‘beautiful’ and bseng ‘black’ agreeing with the
noun wasnaniya ‘blanket’ and they both have class markers. As discussed in 3.2.3 some nouns in153Kamsá have a class marking suffix as well as the prefix wa-. In (3b) both adjectives have the
suffix -ya and the prefix wa-.

Adjectives can have evaluatives. The adjective can have the evaluative whether the nounhas an evaluative or not. In (4a) both the noun and adjective have the diminutive suffix -tem:
gobshin ‘green’ agrees, having the diminutive marker -tem to agree with bominÿ-tem ‘eyes’. In
(4b) gobshin ‘green’ has the suffix -tem but the noun, bominÿ ‘eye’ does not. In (4c) the
adjective has the class marking prefix wa- and the diminutive -tem. Also note that the adjective is
a loan word from Spanish delgado ‘thin’. In (4d) the adjective bëtsa ‘big’ has the diminutive tem.

case marker, i.e. the noun and adjective can both be marked. In (5a), repeated from (1e) above,
both the adjective and the noun are marked with the instrumental marker -k. In (5b) only the
adjective, which is the last part of the NP, is marked with the instrumental marker. As with
nouns, on adjectives the case marker comes after the number markers, as seen in (5c).

There are several types of adjectives in Kamsá. Most end in -an and can precede orfollow the NP they are modifying. Of the adjectives that end in -an, some are derived from
verbs. Some adjectives can be used both as an adjective with the verb ‘to be’ or can have verbal
morphology. Some can only be used as an adjective, i.e. cannot take verbal morphology. Of the
ones that can only be an adjective (and not take verbal morphology), there is a small subset that
has three unique qualities: [1] they generally precede the noun (rather than following the noun, as
most nouns usually, but not always, do); [2] they do not usually agree with the noun; [3] and they
can be used as compounds. These words are bëts ‘big’ and basa ‘small’.
All adjectives, however, can be used in compounds, and all adjectives can follow or
precede the noun. All adjectives can agree with nouns in case, class, number, and evaluative
(except when they are functioning as verbs, of course) and all adjectives can be used
substantively as the head an NP. All adjectives must agree with their referent in class when they
are not preceding the noun (i.e. adjectives agree with their referent if they follow their referent or
when their referent is not in the same NP)
Adjectives derived from verbs behave the same as other adjectives. The following are
some examples of adjectives derived from verbs. It is not clear how productive this derivational
process is, if all verbs can become adjectives. Adjectives derived from verbs are the same as the
verb, but without the initial j-. As with other adjectives, they do not take person, tense, aspect, or
mood markers, but they can take case, number, evaluative, and class markers.
(6a)
(6b)wabwán ‘cooked’ from j-wabwan ‘to cook’
obaná ‘dead’ from jobanan ‘die’The following are two compound nouns with the adjectives basa ‘small’ and bëts ‘big’.
(7a)
(7b)shembasa ‘girl’ (from shem ‘woman’ and basa ‘small’)
bëts mamá ‘grandmother’ (from bëts ‘big’ and mamá ‘mother’)
A subset of adjectives in Kamsá can also be used as verbs. There are perhaps others thatcan be verbs, as well, but that have not appeared as verbs in my data. In (8a) joyejwan ‘be happy’
is used as a verb with verbal prefixes for person, number, evidentiality, and aspect. In (8b)156oyejway ‘happy’ is used with the verb ‘be’ and has no verbal prefixes. Instead it has the number
suffix -ëng ‘pl’ as nouns and adjectives do.

6.5Present and absent referents
Adjectives agree with their referent whether or not it is present in the phrase. In (9a-b) thenoun and adjective are both in the clause, and both are marked with the class marker (for round
things) -be. The word order is different. In (9c) the referent chembalbe ‘tree tomato’ is not in the
clause at all, but the adjective has the class marker -be to agree with it. (9d) is interesting in that
the entity speaking is round (a lulo fruit) and the adjective botaman has the marker -be to agree
with it. The first person singular pronoun ats̈ is in the clause, referring to the lulo fruit.

Other word classes
7.1Introduction
In this chapter, I discuss the function, structure, morphology, and distribution of variousword types that do not fit neatly into other word classes, i.e. words that are not nouns, verbs, or
adjectives. I first discuss adverbs (7.2), including temporal adverbs (7.2.1), adverbs of manner
(7.2.2), and adverbs of degree (7.2.3). In (7.2.4) I discuss some issues for the class of adverbs of
degree. In (7.2) I discuss deictics of place and other words related to location (words that
function as nouns, postpositions, and adjectives). Then I discuss function words and particles,
(7.4), followed by negators (7.5) and quantifiers (7.6).
7.2Adverbs
Adverbs in Kamsá can modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs. They have noinflection, neither nominal inflection nor verbal inflection. There are not many adverbs in the
language, although adjectives can be used adverbially. Many adverbs are derived from Spanish.
Temporal and locative adverbs generally come first in a clause, only preceded by conjunctions
and certain particles. Manner adverbs can occur in different places in a clause. In general, it
seems that adverbs come at the beginning of VPs. They can precede or follow subjects; they
generally precede objects; and they almost always precede verbs.
7.2.1Temporal adverbs
Kamsá uses adverbs for time. They do not agree with nouns (thus are not adjectives);nothing can agree with them (thus they are not nouns); and they cannot be inflected for person or
TAM (thus they are not verbs). The etymology of each adverb is shown in Figure 7.1. Some
adverbs can also be used as postpositions.","[162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172]"

Sentences and multi-clausal constructions
10.1Introduction
In this chapter I examine Kamsá sentences that are composed of more than one clause (inaddition to considering the coordination of multiple elements within a single clause). Two (or
more) clauses may be combined in Kamsá, either through coordination or through subordination.
When two clauses are coordinated, they maintain an equal grammatical status. A subordinate
clause, on the other hand, is dependent upon another (main) clause. Both coordination and
subordination can be signalled (in part) through the use of a class of words called conjunctions.
First I discuss coordination (10.2), including conjunctive coordination (10.2.1),
disjunctive coordination (10.2.2), adversative coordination (10.2.3), and correlatives (10.2.4). In
(10.3) I discuss subordination strategies, and (10.4) is dedicated to indirect discourse.
Kamsá has several conjunctions, including both coordinators and subordinators. Many of
the coordinators, which can connect words or phrases as well as entire clauses, are derived from
Spanish. Figure 10.1 shows the most commonly used conjunctions in Kamsá, providing basic
glosses and etymologies (where known).

Figure 10.1 Conjunctions
The following sections provide illustrations of clause combinations. First, coordination isconsidered, both at the phrase level and at the clause level (10.2). Then I examine how
subordination works in Kamsá (10.3).
10.2Coordination
Coordination is typically signaled by the placement of a conjunction (coordinator)between the constituents being connected. The following sections discuss three types of
coordination in Kamsá: conjunctive (‘and’) coordination (10.2.1), disjunctive (‘or’) coordination
(10.2.2), and adversative (‘but’) coordination (10.2.3). All three coordinating conjunctions in
Kamsá are loans from Spanish; there are no known indigenous coordinators.
10.2.1 Conjunctive coordination
Conjunctive coordination is shown with the conjunction i ‘and’, which has been
borrowed from Spanish y ‘and’. When the conjunction i ‘and’ is placed between two elements,
the two are joined syntactically, with neither element receiving special status or grammatical235marking. When two or more NPs are obliques, they can all have the oblique marker (seen in 1f)
or sometimes only the second NP will have the oblique marker.
The conjunction i ‘and’ can be used to connect phrases within a clause as well as to
connect clauses within a sentence. In (1a), it connects two NPs, each consisting of a single
common noun: boyabasetemënga ‘boys’ and shembasetemënga ‘girls’. In (1b), the conjunction i
‘and’ connects natjëmban ‘peace’ and silentsio ‘silence’, two NPs used adverbially. In (1c), it
connects two VPs: s̈kotabe ‘I pull it out for you’ and kbochjwebuts̈en ‘I’ll throw it to you’. In
(1d), two clauses are connected: akna benchetema ‘you (are) small’ and ats̈na bëtsá ‘I (am) big’.
there is no verb, however, because the copula can be dropped. In (1e) two clauses are connected.
In (1f) there is coordination between NPs that are marked for case, with the benefactive -am.

‘Prepare spots for the people from Popayán, Pasto and Bogotá, and those from the hot

As seen in (1a), the conjunction i ‘and’ may be used, in a sense, to add an NP participant
to a clause. Another means of accomplishing this is with the preposition parej ‘together with’.
Unlike i ‘and’, the word parej ‘together with’ does not conjoin two NPs equally; rather, the
second element is marked with either the instrumental suffix -ak for inanimate nouns or the
comitative suffix -byak for animate ones. Although this isn’t a conjunction (it’s a preposition) it
semantically achieves a similar thing.
Thus, although clearly derived from the Spanish noun parejo ‘equal (to)’, ‘equivalent
(with)’, ‘on a par with’, ‘at the same level (with)’, ‘even’, ‘identical’, the Kamsá word parej
‘together with’ functions as a preposition. In (2a), parej is used twice. In the first instance, it
connects chnungwan te ‘six days’ with ibet ‘night’, meaning ‘six days and (six) nights’; the
second instance functions similarly to express the notion of ‘three days and nights’. In (2b), the
first element of the coordination is not expressed (it is understood to be the 3PL pronoun chëng
‘they’); only the element after parej is overt: the object of the preposition enuta ‘friend’.

Disjunctive coordination in Kamsá is signaled by either the conjunction o ‘or’ (in positive
polarity) or by the conjunction ni ‘neither, nor’ (in negative polarity). Both words are
transparently loans from Spanish.
Like the conjunctive coordinator i ‘and’, the disjunctive coordinator o ‘or’ can be used to
join two phrases, as in (3a), where it occurs between the numerals unga ‘three’ and kanta ‘four’.
In (3b), the conjunction o ‘or’ joins two NPs (place names), Tëtknaiyay and Chitjianëjay. Note
that only the second place has the locative suffix/clitic. In (3c), it connects two VPs : jojandwon-áy-an ‘roll around’ and j-en-obwast-an ‘scratch oneself’.

‘That day we’ll see who will be the first to roll around or scratch himself.’ (Chindoy2
161:11)The word kabëng (the first plural pronoun with the intensifier ka-) is used to refer to indigenous people, often
Kamsás and Ingas, as opposed to other people. One can say someone is ‘kabëng’ to mean that he or she is
Kamsá/Inga” but you wouldn’t use ka-bëng to talk about you and your friends to do something, unless you’re
emphasizing that the group is indigenous. Thus, this sentence means the priest found the indigenous people there.
28238In negative polarity, the disjunctive coordinator ni ‘nor’ from Spanish ni ‘neither, nor, not
even’ is used. It can be between NPs (nouns and pronouns) as seen in (4a) in which it is between
three nouns, and in (4b) between two nouns. It can also be used to connect VPs, as in (4c). In
addition to appearing between conjoined elements, ni ‘nor’ may also (as in Spanish usage) occur
before the first element as well. In such instances (as in 4a), it is means neither … nor.

10.2.3 Adversative coordination
The adversative coordinator pero ‘but’ is also a Spanish word. Although it may connect
elements within a single clause (as in 5d), it most commonly conjoins two main clauses. As such,
it appears between two clauses. In (5a) it introduces a new clause. In (5b) pero also introduces a
new clause, and the word nÿe is also used. As discussed further in 10.2.4 nÿe ‘just, only’ also has
a correlative function. In (5c) pero creates a contrast.

jamnan ‘be’ while the second clause has an uninflected verb marked with the benefactive clitic
=am. Also note that jamnan ‘be’ in the first clause has the emphatic marker kwa-. In (29b) nÿe is

before lempe ‘all’.

Kamsá has several strategies for connecting a dependent clause to a main clause—that is,for marking subordination. Most often, subordinate clauses are indicated by free words
(subordinating conjunctions or subordinators) that occur at the beginning of the subordinate
clause. Alternatively, a few such subordinators occur at the end of their respective subordinating
clause. There is also one subordinating clitic, =as, that appears at the end of the subordinate
clause.
Figure 10.2 (on the following page) lists the major Kamsá subordinators, providing basic
glosses and indicating where in the clause they are located—that is, whether at the beginning or
at the end of the subordinate clause.","[245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]"
"54Verbs that act as nouns grammatically are not included in this section, but are in section 4.4.
Nouns that are derived from verbs are found in 4.2.
3.2Noun classes
Kamsá has a system that falls between noun class and noun classifier, typologically,fitting neither definition neatly. Here I choose the term class because the markers are an
obligatory part of the noun. Kamsá does not have grammatical gender, but there are at least 10
class markers that exist in the language, as well as a subset of nouns in which the noun itself is a
suffix, often called a ‘repeater’ in other South American languages. The class markers are bound
morphemes; they are suffixes which form a phonological word with their host and cannot be
removed or changed. Demonstratives, adjectives, and sometimes numerals which agree with the
noun have a matching suffix, depending on the position of the demonstrative, adjective, or
numeral in relation to the noun. A few classes are signaled by both a prefix and a suffix, but no
classes are signaled by a prefix without a suffix.
The majority of nouns in Kamsá do not belong to a noun class; the nouns with class
markers are a very small subset of the nouns in the language. The majority of nouns have no
special suffix and the adjectives, demonstratives, or numerals which agree with them do not take
a special suffix, either. Although some noun classes have something semantic in common, such
as signifying that the objects are round or hairy, many do not fall into a particular semantic
domain, and for some classes, I have not found enough nouns to determine what if any the
semantic relationship for the nouns could be.
After showing that most nouns do not belong to the class of nouns that require a class
marker, I show 11 noun classes and one additional suspect noun class. For each category, I give
an example of the noun with an adjective, where possible with the adjective bchenda ‘blue’.
Then, I give other examples of other nouns in the class. Finally, for each category I offer an
explanation of what could connect them semantically. Where possible, I include both native
Kamsá words and loanwords from Spanish that belong to the class. The loan words that have
class markers may lend additional insight into the semantic domain of these noun classes because
they are more recent additions to the class. I start with the the unmarked noun class giving
examples of a human, an object, a place, and an abstract thing, to show that there is no class or55gender for these words, the majority of words in the language. There is no morphological
difference in the root between animate and inanimate nouns, or between human and nonhuman
nouns. Again, it is important to emphasize that most nouns in Kamsá do NOT have any class
marker, while there are some very specific groups of nouns that do have special noun-class
suffixes.
3.2.1Nouns without noun class markers
In the following (1a-e), the adjective botaman ‘beautiful’ does not have any uniquesuffixes, regardless of the noun it agrees with: ‘girl’, ‘tree’, ‘mountain’, ‘night’, or ‘story’. Thus,
the adjectives that agree with this class of nouns do not have a special suffix. Rather, they retain
whatever suffix they have in their basic form (often an optional -a).

dropped, as seen in (6a-c).

Nouns of this class end in -be and adjectives that agree with them have the same suffix,-be. In (3a), shmnë-be ‘egg’ has an obligatory suffix -be; shmnë does not exist in isolation.
bchendë ‘blue’ is realized as bchendë-be because it agrees with shmnëbe. To compare, (3b)
shows shlfots̈ ‘bird’, a noun that does not take a class marker, with bchendë ‘blue’. Note
bchendë does not have any suffix.

Many of the nouns in this category are round or spherical. Of course, not all round thingsin the language are in this class, nor are all of the things in this class necessarily round, but it
more or less is a semantic attribute of most nouns belonging to this class and taking the ending in
-be.
It is also important to note that there is another homophonous suffix -be in Kamsá, which
is used for the genitive marker. The genitive marker attaches to the possessor. In (7) bata ‘aunt’
has the genitive marker -be to show that she is the possessor of the dog. It does not mean that she
is round. Furthermore, if there is an adjective that agrees with ‘aunt’, that adjective will not have
the suffix -be.

dogNouns of this class end in -ya and the adjectives that agree with them have the suffix -ya
as well as a prefix, wa-. In (8), the noun wa-snani-ya has both the prefix wa- and the suffix -ya.
There is no word *snan in isolation; without this prefix and suffix, it is not a grammatical word.
The adjective bchendë ‘blue’ has both a prefix wa- and a suffix -ya to agree with the noun wasnani-ya. The final vowel ë in bchendë becomes -i, presumably because it is preceding the glide
/y/.

The nouns in this class end in -i, with some morphophonemic variation. The adjectivesthat agree with these nouns take the suffix -i. There is no prefix for this class. In (14) the noun
biaji ‘yagé, ayuahuasca’ ends in -i and the adjective bontja ‘bitter’ (check) takes the suffix -i to
become bontji. As in the other classes, the noun classifier is part of the word; biaj without -i is
not a grammatical word. Although the -i as the ending of these nouns could be explained by the
Spanish they are borrowed from (Spanish leche becoming lechi), the adjectives agreeing with
them have to have this -i, as well, as seen in 12 and 13.

3.2.6Class 5: nouns with -jwa
This class contains nouns that end with -jwa and sometimes have a prefix wa-. As inClass 2, not all of the nouns in this class have the prefix wa- but the adjective agreeing with them
must take the prefix wa-. Note that this is the same prefix as in Class 2.
In the following example, botoman ‘beautiful’ takes both the suffix -jwa and the prefix
wa- to agree with yents̈i-jwa ‘cloth’. The noun yents̈i-jwa does not have any prefix.","[67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74]"
"Noun phrases containing both an adjective and determiner (as well as the head noun) are
common. In (6) the noun ents̈anga ‘people’ occurs with an adjective bakna ‘bad’ and the

modifying the adjective.

"21Some community members have noticed that the language is not being passed on to
children, and they have various reactions to this, ranging from desire to take action to feeling that
no action is necessary, since the children will still somehow have the language because it is “in
their blood”, to feeling futility, that the language will be lost no matter what, since children are
concerned more with popular music than with the language of their elders. Many people,
however, have not noticed how dire the situation is, perhaps in part because many children do
indeed know the basic greetings and some vocabulary, and so can often come across as more
engaged with the language than they actually are. Él/ella) entiende ‘(s)he understands’ is a
common thing said about members of the younger generation.
1.3.4Education
The Kamsá have many resources at their disposal for linguistic and cultural preservationand have begun several projects to maintain their language. These include a series of bilingual
schools in Sibundoy, a Kamsá preschool in Bogotá, language and culture classes in the cabildo,
an app for phones, a radio station, many websites, and books.
Sibundoy has its own bilingual school system, called the Sibundoy Institución
Etnoeducativa Rural Bilingüe Artesanal Kamentsá ‘Sibundoy ethno-educational rural, bilingual,
artisanal Kamsá Institution’, run by Kamsá community members and consisting of a preschool,
elementary school, and high school. Thus a child can, in principle, attend the bilingual school for
the entirety of his or her education. Any child can attend, whether ethnically Kamsá or not. I
have not been inside the school myself, but according to people in the community, most of the
instruction is in Spanish with some lessons about Kamsá culture and some instruction of
vocabulary. Thus, these are not bilingual schools according to the classical definition that
demands that there be instruction using two languages as teaching languages in subjects other
than the languages themselves. Rather, the Kamsá school focuses more on culture, having
cultural workshops where children can learn to make traditional Kamsá items, such as bracelets,
but additionally has some Kamsá language classes (not unlike foreign language instruction in
many schools in Colombia and elsewhere).
There was a thesis project done in 2016 by Agreda España, a pedagogy student at the
Universidad Distrital in Bogotá, to implement knowledge of the traditional Kamsá garden into22the daily school system at the bilingual high school. The school seems interested in continuing
projects that connect the students with the traditional community and in the future may start a
documentation project where the students record elders speaking Kamsá as a way to engage them
while at the same time recording knowledge before it may be lost.
In Bogotá, there is a preschool for children called the Casa de Pensamiento Shinÿak
(literally ‘House of Shinÿak Thought’). It is one of several preschools for indigenous children in
Colombia’s capital, and, like the school in Sibundoy, it is open to all.
There are also educational apps. A group of Kamsá university students has been
collaborating to make Kamsá language learning apps. The first of these apps, Juatsjinÿam
Kamentsá ‘Practicing Kamsá’ was released in November of 2017. Its purpose is to help children
learn vocabulary, particularly related to the garden, clothing terms, and colors. The cabildo in
Sibundoy sometimes offers language classes for community members. Anyone can attend these
classes, and they can be used to supplement classes from the bilingual schools.
1.3.5The future of Kamsá
Because most of the parent generation are not competent speakers and are not passing thelanguage on to their children, it seems that the language will be lost unless a great effort is made
to revitalize it now. Much of the infrastructure is in place: the bilingual school, written materials,
and strong social presence of the cabildo. But community effort is necessary for today’s children
to learn the language and pass it on to their children. My feeling is that grandparents would need
to start teaching Kamsá to the children in the community now, maybe following a language nest
model, or the language will mostly be gone in 20 or 30 years.
1.4Previous research on the language
This dissertation is the first reference grammar of Kamsá. In this section I describe thehistory of research on the language and the major earlier contributions. There have been five
major contributors to the documentation and description of Kamsá. Much has been published
about the culture of the people and certain aspects of the language, and there are many Kamsá23texts that have been translated into Spanish and/or English, but there has not yet been a full
grammatical description.
First, there was Marcelino de Castellví (1908-1951), a Capuchin priest from Spain, who
founded the Centro de Investigaciones Lingüísticas y Etnológicas de la Amazonia Colombiana
(‘Center for Linguistic and Ethnological Research in the Colombian Amazon’, CILEAC). He
wrote several articles about Kamsá including “Bibliografía de la familia lingüística Kamsá”
(‘Bibliography of the Kamsá linguistic family’) (1940).
Second, Linda Howard, a linguist working for the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL),
spent a number of years living in Sibundoy. SIL was present in the region for almost 30 years,
but with very few publications. Howard published two articles in English and two in Spanish on
the language in the late 1960s: a brief description of the phonology “Camsá phonology” (Howard
1967) and an attempt at explaining verbal inflection from a tagmemic analysis, a theoretical
framework used by SIL linguists in the 1970s: “Camsá: certain features of verb inflection as
related to paragraph types” (Howard 1977).
Third, in the early 1990s, John McDowell, a folklorist at the University of Indiana,
published So wise were our elders: Mythic narratives of the Kamsá (McDowell 1994), a book of
traditional stories in Kamsá, all translated into English, with extensive commentary. Although an
impressive book and an excellent record of traditional culture, its purpose was not to describe the
morphology or syntax of the language, nor is there any interlinear glossing. He has also written
several articles including “Collaborative Ethnopoetics: The View from the Sibundoy Valley”,
“Discourse Authority in the Sibundoy Valley” (1995), and “The Community-building Mission of
Kamsá Ritual Language” (1990), among others.
Fourth, in the 1990s, José Narciso Jamioy Muchavisoy, a Kamsá linguist, published a
few articles about the language after completing his Masters in Ethnolinguistics at the
Universidad de los Andes in 1989. Some of his articles are: “Tiempo, aspecto y modo en
kamentsa” (‘tense, aspect, and mood in Kamsá’, 1992), “Estructuras predicativas del kamentsa”
(‘predicative structures of Kamsá’, 1999) and “Observaciones a los documentos de Fray
Marcelino de Castellví sobre la lengua Kamëntsá” (‘Observations on the documents of Father
Marcelino de Castellví about the Kamsá language’, 1999). In addition to these articles, he also
helped translate Colombia’s constitution of 1991 into Kamsá.","[34, 35, 36, 37]"
"The sections on pronouns include some notes on the semantics of the pronouns, a brief
discussion of the alignment, the basics of case marking on pronouns, and the use of the
intensifier and evaluatives on pronouns. The lack of reciprocal pronouns is discussed. Finally, I
present my attempt at analyzing indefinite pronouns. This chapter discusses independent
pronouns, not bound pronominal marking on verbs, which is discussed in Chapter 4.
5.2Independent pronouns
Kamsá has nine personal pronouns for subject/object. As with nouns, there is nomorphological difference for pronouns that would depend on whether they function as the
subject of an intransitive sentence, the subject of a transitive sentence, or a direct object. They
mostly behave as nouns do in the language. They take case markers, and sometimes evaluatives.
Like nouns, they do not seem to take class markers when they are referring to a noun with class
markers. this section does not discuss pronominal affixes (e.g. pronominal agreement markers on
verbs). Kamsá is a prodrop language. Person and number is marked by agreement affixes on the
verb, both for subjects and objects, and the pronoun is not necessary.
5.2.1Personal pronouns
The pronouns for first person have the same root for dual and plural, bë- with ng forplural (like the plural marker on nouns and adjectives) and -ndat for the dual: bëndat ‘we (two)
and bëng ‘we (more than two)’. Similarly, the second person pronouns have the same root tsë in
the plural and dual, with -at for the dual and -ng for the plural. There is a second form of second
person plural: tsëngaftang. The pronouns for third person all have the same root, with the
singular having a vowel -a, and the dual and plural having -at and -ëng, respectively. The third136person dual pronoun has another form chëndat. The third person pronoun likely comes from
determiner ch. Note that for first and second person, the singular pronoun is unrelated to the
plural and dual. Figure 5.1 shows the personal pronouns.

There is no difference between inclusive and exclusive in the first person plural; thedifference is only between dual and plural. bëng is a very culturally important word, being used
when people are discussing their community, and has come to be associated with a sort of
indigenous resistance and fight for cultural rights, but it is also simply the first person plural
pronoun.
For second person singular, there is no difference between formal and informal. In many
Kamsá materials, ak is translated as Usted, the formal second person singular form in Spanish,
rather than as tu, the informal second person singular, perhaps because in the Kamsá community
people use Usted with each other much more than tu. Indeed, I have met some Kamsás for whom
tu does not exist in their speech and who use Usted with everyone: parents, spouses, children,
friends.
The third person singular pronoun cha has no gender; it can mean 'he', 'she,' and
sometimes 'it', although for pronominal reference to inanimate nouns usually a determiner is used
pronominally instead of this third person pronoun. The third person pronoun perhaps comes from
the determiner ch ‘the’ often pronounced as chë, (or perhaps ch comes from cha). Often, because
of the reduction of the vowel in cha, it is hard to tell if the word being said is the determiner chë
or the pronoun cha. Thus, another possibility is that they are the same word, but people think
they are different words for other reasons, such as for the project of creating a written language.
1385.2.3Use of pronouns and alignment: subject and object
In Kamsá, there is no difference in form between subject and object pronouns, just asthere is no difference in form between subject and object nouns. The language is thus neither
nominative/accusative nor ergative/absolutive in its alignment for pronouns.
In (2a), the first person singular pronoun ats̈ is the subject of an intransitive sentence,
with jan ‘go’ as the verb. The verb agrees with the subject, shown by the first person singular
subject marking së. In (2b) ats̈ is the subject of a transitive sentence. As in (2a), the verb has the
prefix së- to show that the subject is first person singular. In (2c), ats̈ is the direct object of a
transitive verb. There is no change to ats̈; the form is identical to that in (2a) and (2b). The verb
in (2c) is marked with a first person singular prefix s̈o- to agree with the direct object.

3.3.3Noun cases
The nominal system of Kamsá is somewhere along the spectrum between having casesuffixes versus postpositions. In this section, I first outline the case system, showing each of the
cases and postpositions and their allomorphs, and giving examples of some of the uses of each
case and postposition. Then I discuss the distribution of each case and postposition, showing
whether it can occur with common nouns (both animate and inanimate where possible), proper
nouns, pronouns, and loans words. Many cases are different for animate nouns and inanimate
nouns: namely, animate nouns have the suffix -bi preceding the case marker whereas inanimate
nouns do not. Also, there are some cases which do not seem to be possible semantically with
proper nouns or pronouns (such as the instrumental) and others that are not possible with
inanimate nouns (such as the comitative). This will become apparent with each case that has this
distinction and will be discussed further. At the end of this section, I give evidence for why
some things are actual cases whereas other things seem to be postpositions.","[83, 84]"

Other than a few Spanish missionaries who wrote word lists in the 18 th century, there wasno attempt made at devising an orthography for Kamsá until the 1970s, when SIL linguists first
arrived in the Sibundoy Valley. Since then, several people have been writing the language,
including anthropologists, Kamsá community members, and other researchers. Although most of
the orthographic symbols are the same across the board, the orthographies do differ on the
following sounds (in IPA): /x/, /ʂ/, /tʂ/, /ɨ/, and /ⁿdʒ/. There is also variation in how people write
the vowel-plus-glide sequence /oj/ (either <oi> or <oy>) and debate as to whether there is
(underlyingly) a labial-velar approximant in the language or whether this sound is more properly
a high back rounded vowel—that is, people differ on whether to use <w> or <u> to transcribe the
bilabial approximant.
The first person to really propose an orthography of Kamsá was Linda Howard (1967;
1977), a missionary linguist from SIL (her work is discussed further in Section 1.4). She based
her orthography on her phonemic analysis of the language and proposed more or less what I have
written above. That said, as many SIL researchers have done in Latin America, she followed
Spanish conventions, such that /k/ is spelled <qu> before /i, e/, but is spelled <c> elsewhere. The
main differences between her orthography and mine are that she writes the voiceless velar stop
as <qu> or <c> rather than <k>, the retroflex fricative as <x> rather than <s̈>, and the retroflex
affricate as <tx> rather than <ts̈>. This use of <x> may be confusing to those familiar with the
IPA, since <x> (in the IPA) is used to transcribe the voiceless velar fricative and some Kamsá
writers have used <x> as the voiceless velar fricative (Jamioy Muchavisoy 1992, 1999).
McDowell (2014) follows Howard in her orthography except for a couple of
modifications. He uses <k> throughout for the voiceless velar stop (as do I). He does not use
<ë>, or any other symbol for IPA [ɨ], at all, arguing that this vowel is not phonemic but is
predictable based on its environment, namely that it is inserted when there are consonant clusters
or nasals. For example, McDowell generally transcribes the third person plural pronoun, which
phonetically is closest to [tʃɨᵑɡa], as <chnga> (p.106) or, sometimes, as <chunga> (p.228),
whereas most Kamsá authors write <chënga>, using the symbol <ë> to transcribe the high
central vowel. With other words, he transcribes [ɨ] as <u> or <e>. Like Howard, he uses <x> for
the retroflex fricative. For the prenasalized voiced palato-alveolar affricate (IPA /ⁿdʒ/), he writes50<ny>, claiming that it is an allophone of /y/, perhaps a nasal preceding an allophone of /y/. He
transcribes the labio-velar glide /w/ as <w>, even when it follows another consonant, whereas
others transcribe it as <u> in such environments (e.g., he writes <twamba> ‘hen’ as compared to
others’ <tuamba>). Finally, he writes the vowel-plus-glide sequence /oj/ as <oy>, whereas some
writers prefer <oi>.
The divergences from the IPA that are shared by most transcriptions (including my own)
are as follows: 1) superscripts are not employed for prenasalized segments (e.g., <nd> for / nd/),
2) voiced velar segments are written (following common typesetting) <g> as opposed to /ɡ/, 3)
the voiceless palato-alveolar affricate is written (following Spanish) <ch> as opposed to /tʃ/, 4)
the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative is written (following English) <sh> as opposed to /ʃ/, 5) the
voiceless velar fricative is written (following Spanish) <j> as opposed to <x>, 6) the palatal nasal
is written (following Spanish) <ñ> as opposed to /ɲ/, 7) the palatal lateral approximant is written
(following Spanish) <ll> as opposed to /ʎ/, and 8) the palatal glide is written (following English)
<y> as opposed to /j/.
The symbols that differ among transcribers are summarized in Figure 2.5.

2.7.2 Justifications for my orthography
<p, b, f>
/b/ seems to be phonemic with [f] as an allophone (namely in consonant clusters when it
precedes voiceless consonants) and [p] as another allophone (in word final positions). I have51decided to write these sounds with three separate symbols (i.e., as <b>,<p>, and <f>) for two
reasons. First, I believe it will be more useful to people when they are reading the language to
see the surface realization of underlying /b/. Second, it is the case that these phones are different
phonemically among loan words from Spanish. When there is some free variation (mainly
between [b] and [f]), I write the sound as <b>, sometimes with a note.
<ë> (ɨ)
The high central vowel is problematic for several reasons. First, it is difficult to determine
whether it is actually a phoneme, because—for most (but not all) words—it is phonologically
predictable. Second, it is often inserted as an epenthetic vowel between consonants, particularly
nasals. These issues are discussed in greater depth above on the phonology of the language. The
third difficulty is the question of how to write this vowel. Most authors have chosen <ë>, so I am
following the literature by using that symbol. McDowell (2014) does not write it at all; instead,
when he believes it to be epenthetic, he excludes it completely and when he believes it to be
underlying /u/ or /e/, he writes it as <u> or <e> accordingly.
<w, y>
Glides: I have decided to write <w> although many Kamsa writers use <u>.
Problems with using <x>
I have chosen not to use <x> as a symbol in my orthography, neither for the voiceless
retroflex fricative /ʂ/ nor for the voiceless velar fricative /x/, because it has been used by several
authors (McDowell 1994, Howard 1967) for the retroflex consonants, so that if I were to use it to
symbolize the voiceless velar fricative, as in IPA, it would be confused by native speakers who
have seen it written for retroflex consonants. Excluding <x> from my orthography will avoid
some confusion. Following the conventions of many Kamsá writers and the Kamsá cabildo
‘governing body’, I use <s̈> to transcribe the voiceless retroflex fricative /ʂ/ and <ts̈> to
transcribed the voiceless retroflex affricate /tʂ/. Following Spanish orthography (and all Kamsá
orthographies), I use <j> to transcribe the voiceless velar fricative /x/.","[62, 63, 64, 65]"

3.2.12 Noun class with case
When the noun appears with case markers, the case marker is the last suffix of the
adjective, after the noun classifier. In the following example, ndëts̈-be ‘rock’ is in the
instrumental case (with the suffix -k). The adjective ftsen ‘black’ agrees with ndëts̈-be and has
the classifier suffix -be followed by the instrumental suffix -k.

When a noun is plural, the class marker comes before the plural marker. In (26) shemnëbe ‘egg’ has the class marker -be and is followed by -ng to show it is plural. Note that the plural
marker is not obligatory; shemnë-be could be plural without -ng.

McDowell states that noun class markers (which he terms noun classifiers) can be addedto words that do not necessarily have them as a way to be creative with the language (1994). He
gives the following example. In (27), from one of McDowell’s texts, the determiner ch refers to
the oso ‘bear’ mentioned before in the same line. The determiner ch has the noun class marker be which is used for round things. According to McDowell, this means he is being referred to as
a round person, and that he is a humorous oaf rather than a fierce suitor that bears are in other
stories.

‘And as for that bear, he put (them) on the fire.’ (From McDowell 2014:220)
I have not found any productivity with noun class in my data. McDowell gives oneexample of this occurring, and it is with -be. Whether or not other class markers could be used
productively is unknown. If it is true, however, then these noun class markers perhaps seem more
like noun classifiers than markers of noun classes.
3.3Other nominal morphology
Kamsá nouns can have derivational morphology, though it is very limited, mainly tonominalize verbs, and also evaluatives including diminutive, pejorative, and augmentative. There
is also considerable inflectional morphology, for number and cases. This section discusses the
morphology of nouns, including noun cases, number markers, and diminutives. Noun class66markers were discussed above (see 3.2). Some of the morphology was discussed in Chapter 3,
but here it is discussed in more detail, including all of the morphemes and allomorphs and their
uses and meanings.
3.3.1 Number
Kamsá nouns have suffixes for number and nouns can be singular, dual, or plural.
Singular nouns have no overt marking, whereas dual and plural marking is shown by a suffix on
the noun. Number marking is not obligatory in Kamsá, and often plural and dual nouns are left
optionally in their singular form, especially when it is clear from the context that the noun is
plural or dual.
The suffixes are summarized in Figure 3.2.

consonantSingularØbata ‘aunt’shlofts̈ ‘bird’Dual-atbata-t ‘two aunts’shlofts̈-at ‘two birds’Plural-(ë)ngbata-ng ‘aunts’shlofts̈-ëng ‘birds’Figure 3.2 Nominal number
In the following example, kes̈ 'dog' is kes̈-at in the dual and kes̈-ëng in the plural. Because
batá ‘aunt’ has a final stressed vowel which cannot be deleted (as in other words that have final
stressed vowels, but unlike words that have optional final vowels; see Chapter 2 on the
phonology). When batá is dual, batá + at becomes batát. When batá is plural, batá + ëng
becomes batáng.
(kanÿe) kes̈ ‘one dog’
(uta) kes̈-at ‘two dogs’
(unga) kes̈-ëng ‘three dogs’
(kanÿe) batá ‘one aunt’
(uta) bata-t ‘two aunts’
(unga) bata-ng ‘three aunts’67Nouns that end in -n become -ng in the plural as seen below, where s̈es̈on ‘baby’ becomes
s̈es̈ong. and begon ‘fish’ becomes begong in the plural. Thus the n → Ø /__+ng ?
s̈es̈on ‘baby’
s̈es̈ong ‘babies’
begon ‘fish’
begong ‘fish (pl)’
The evidence that these are suffixes rather than separate words or clitics can be seen with
nouns that undergo a phonological change when the plural or dual marker is added, as seen
above with nouns that end in vowels, such as bata ‘aunt’ which is batang in the plural, ‘aunts’.
Also, nouns that end in -n undergo a phonological change when the plural marker is added, as
seen where the plural of begon ‘fish’ is begong ‘fish (pl)’ The second piece of evidence that
these are suffixes rather than separate words is that psychologically speakers think that they are
part of the word based on questions I have asked consultants. Finally, -at and -ng never stand on
their own.
In Kamsá, the dual and plural markers are optional. In (28), three options for marking
dual can be seen. In (28a), the uta viajerata 'two travelers' has both the numeral two and a dual
suffix, -at. In (28b), viajerata has the dual suffix but not numeral. In (28c), the noun tjok
‘mountain’ is modified by uta 'two' but has no dual marker. In (28d), the ungrammatical example
shows that plural cannot be used for dual. Note that (28c) has the determiner ch to mark
definiteness/specificity whereas (28a) and (28b) do not.

Similarly, plural nouns can be marked with both a number and a plural marker (29a),
without a number and only a plural marker (29b), with a number without a plural marker (29c),
and without a number and without a plural marker (29d), where the context makes it clear that
the noun is plural. Note that (29d) could be singular, plural, or dual; context is needed to
determine which it is.

3.3.2Evaluatives: diminutive, pejorative, and ‘poor’
There are three evaluatives in Kamsá and they are used as suffixes on the noun andsometimes the adjective agree with the noun. There is a diminutive -tem, a pejorative -ëfja with
allomorphs -ëja and -ëfa, and a suffix for ‘poor’ -jema.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]"
"Often they will agree with a noun that is not present in the NP, indexing the noun by bearing
morphemes that agree with the missing noun in class, number, case, and/or evaluative
(anaphorically) to indicate they are tracking a noun mentioned earlier but not repeated later in the
discourse.
As discussed in (3.2) on noun class, adjectives in a noun phrase must agree with the noun
they modify (unless the adjective precedes the head noun). In (16a), the adjective bën ‘long’
agrees with bichaj ‘tongue’ in class, with the suffix -j. In (16b) the adjectives botaman
‘beautiful’ and bseng ‘black’ both agree in class with wasniya ‘poncho’, in that they are marked
with the prefix wa- and the suffix -iya, both of which are found on the noun. For nouns that do
not have the prefix wa- but for which adjectives agreeing with them have wa- see section 3.2.

noun of their NP. This may be so because these parts of speech always precede the noun.
However, when a numeral is a head of its own NP, it must agree in class with its (implied but
absent) referent. In (17a), the numeral unga ‘three’ is marked with the classifier -be to agree with
mashakbe ‘lulo fruit’, even though this noun occurs in a separate phrase. Similarly, in (17b), inÿe
‘other’ has the class marker -jwa to agree with yents̈iya ‘cloth’. (See 3.2 for why the class marker
is -jwa instead of -ya.)

8.2.3Phrase-level clitics
There are at least two phrase level clitics that occur at the end of NPs. These include casemarking clitics and the topic marker =na. If =na is present in an NP it is always the last element
of the NP.
8.2.3.1 NPs with case-marking clitics
NPs can have case marking. Usually, case marking is a clitic attached to the last element
of the NP, after the class marker, as discussed in 3.1.12. In (18), bwangan ‘red’ has the
morphemes wa- and -ya to agree with wasnaniya ‘poncho’. In addition, it has the case marker -k
for the instrumental. As discussed in 3.1.12, case marking clitics come after the suffixes on
nouns including the suffixes for class, number, and evaluatives.

The topic marker =na, which is particularly common in narratives, often cliticizes to
NPs, usually the last element in the noun phrase. In (19a), yendon ‘squirrel’ exhibits the clitic
=na,. It can attach to pronouns, as well, as seen in (19b). The topic marker =na is always the last
element of the NP: in (19c) =na comes after the locative marker =ok. Similarly, in (19d), =na
cliticizes to the second element in the NP, coming after the evaluative -jem. In (19e) =na also
cliticizes to the second element in the NP tsbanan ‘tall’ and comes after the allative case marker
-oy.","[214, 215]"
"24Fifth, Juan Bautista Jacanamijoy Juajibioy, a Kamsá taita who worked with SIL for many
years, began compiling a dictionary. He was disappeared in 2008 and never finished the project,
but other community members have been working on completing it and it will be published soon.
In addition to these five people, Alain Fabre (2000) has written a brief grammatical sketch of the
language: “Algunos rasgos tipológicos del Kamsá (Valle de Sibundoy, Alto Putumayo, sudoeste
de Colombia) vistos desde una perspectiva areal” (‘Several typological features of Kamsá seen
from an areal perspective, Sibundoy Valley, Upper Putumayo, southeast Colombia’). It gives a
brief description of some features of the language, using existing sources, and he describes agent
and patient marking and noun classifiers in the language. This 30-page sketch is perhaps the best
linguistic description of the language. He also wrote a similar paper in English: “Kamsá, a poorly
documented isolated language spoken in South-Western Colombia” (Fabre 2001). There is also
an MA thesis in 2013 by Chloé Garsault about the phonology of the language, called ""Éléments
de sociolinguistique et de phonologie du kamsá, langue isolée du sud-ouest Colombien""
(“Elements of socioloinguistics and phonology of Kamsá, a language isolate of Southwest
Colombia”) and an MA thesis by a Kamsá linguist, María Clara Juajiboy Mutumbajoy, in Bogotá
in 1995 called “Actancia verbal en Kamentsa” (“Verbal agreement in Kamentsa).
In addition to these linguistic works, there are several collections of stories and poems in
Kamsá and many books and articles about Kamsá culture. In addition to McDowell’s book of
Kamsá stories, there are also two books of stories compiled and translated by Alberto Juajibioy
Chindoy, both containing Kamsá and Spanish texts side-by-side and glossaries at the end of each
book. One is called Relatos ancestrales del folclor camentsa ‘Ancestral tales of Camentsa
folklore’ (1988) and the other is Lenguaje Ceremonial y Narraciones Tradicionales de La
Cultura Kamënts̈á ‘Ceremonial Language and Traditional Narratives of the Kamënts̈á Culture’.
There is a doctoral dissertation by Haydée Seijas (1969) at Tulane University called The
medicinal system of the Sibundoy Indians, in which she discusses the medical practices of the
Kamsá and Inga. There is an excellent book about the history of the Capuchins in Sibundoy
Valley, Servants of Gods or Masters of Men?: The Story of a Capuchin Mission in Amazonia, by
Victor Daniel Bonilla (1971). There is a Kamsá poet, Hugo Jamioy Juagibioy (2005), who
published a book of poetry in Kamsá and Spanish called Danzantes del viento / Bínÿbe
oboyejuayeng (‘Dancers of the wind’ in English). Finally, there was a doctoral dissertation
published in 2018 about the philosophy, culture, and language of Kamsá by Alejandro Chindoy,25called Constituted and constituting symbols of the Kamënts̈á culture: essays on native philosophy
of culture. There are also many pedagogical materials made by the Kamsá community and/or
SIL.
1.5Methodology
This dissertation is based on fieldwork that I conducted with Kamsá speakers inSibundoy Valley and Bogotá. I spent a total of 18 months in Colombia between 2015 and 2018;
of that time, I spent about 6 months in Sibundoy. I worked mainly with older Kamsá speakers,
above the age of 60, some of whom had never left the Putumayo/Nariño region. I recorded word
lists, elicitations, conversations, traditional stories, and life histories in Kamsá and Spanish. This
dissertation includes one of these texts, which shows the influence of Spanish on the language.
Because there are so many existing texts in the language (albeit without grammatical description
or glossing) I also took advantage of these existing materials for ideas and hypotheses about the
grammar. The example sentences in this dissertation come both from my own recordings
(elicitations and texts) and from these other sources. Sample sentences from Chindoy’s and
McDowell’s stories are marked as such; from my eliciations are marked MC; and from my
longer texts are marked with the date. All recordings were WAV files, recorded with a
TASCAM recorder, except for a few recordings done by a couple of Kamsá friends on their cell
phones.
All materials, including audio recordings of traditional stories, conversations between
speakers, and elicitations will be archived with AILLA (Archive of Indigenous Languages of
Latin America). I chose AILLA because it is the main archive for languages of Latin America
and it is also where McDowell archived his Kamsá materials. They have agreed to archive the
materials.
1.6Typological overview
In the following sections I provide a general description of Kamsá’s phonology,morphology, and syntax, placing the language in a typological context.","[37, 38, 39]"

Nouns
3.1Introduction
In this chapter, nominal morphology and the structure of noun phrases in Kamsá arediscussed. First, I lay out the inflectional morphology that nouns can take, and the head of the NP
is identified, along with other elements that can be part of the noun phrase, including
demonstratives, numbers, adjectives, and adpositions. Nouns are an open class in Kamsá.
Nouns can bear inflectional morphology, although a noun can be a word without any
bound morphemes. The inflectional morphology includes: number marking (plural and dual),
noun class markers, a topic marker, and a determiner that is a clitic preceding the noun. Kamsá
has derivational morphology, including suffixes to make an agent from a verb and evaluatives
(diminutives, augmentatives, and pejoratives). Kamsá nouns that are derived from verbs also
lack morphology, i.e. they are stripped of the morphology of the verb.
Although Kamsá nouns can have multiple suffixes, it is not common for all possible
suffixes to appear on a single noun at the same time. For example, a noun would not normally
have a plural marker, a diminutive suffix, and a class marker all at once. If the noun has a class
marker, the diminutive and/or the plural marker do not appear. Class markers are obligatory for
those nouns that fall in the class of nouns that have class markers, whereas number marking is
optional, and diminutives (by their nature) are also optional. Case markers are more flexible,
because although they are obligatory, they can appear at the end of the noun phrase instead of on
the noun itself, as discussed further below.
The structure of a noun with a class marker is:
root + class + (dim) + (number) + (case)
The structure of a noun without a class marker is:
root + (dim) + (number) + (case)
For example, ‘with the little tree tomatoes’ could be chembalbe-tem-ëng-ak.","[66, 67]"

As seen in the table above, subordinate clauses that formed with ch ‘that’, or the question
words nts̈amo ‘how’, ndayents̈ ‘where’, nda ‘who’, or ndayá ’what’ always begin with the
subordinator, whereas in temporal subordinate clauses with ora ‘when’ or in causal subordinate
clauses with kaus ‘because’, the subordinator comes at the end of its clause. Furthermore,
subordinate clauses with ch, nts̈amo, and question words tend to follow the main clause, whereas
temporal and causal subordinate clauses can either follow or precede the main clause.
10.3.1 Subordinate clauses with nts̈amo ‘how, what happened’
A common subordinator is nts̈amo ‘how’, which (in such constructions) is used much like
the English word ‘what’. To see how nts̈amo is used in questions, see 9.6.2. In (7a), nts̈amo
‘how’ subordinates the clause ‘horrible [things] happened’ to the main clause ‘the older brother
… returned to see’. In (7b), nts̈amo ‘how’ is used for ‘how it happened’. In (7c), it is in a
subordinate clause following the main verb montsetats̈ëmbo ‘they (didn’t) know’ with an242infinitive j-tsenojwanan ‘get rid of’. The verb in this subordinate clause j-tsenojwanan ‘get rid
of’ is not inflected.

Multiple temporal adverbs can appear in a clause. In (2a) mor ‘now’ and ya ‘already’ areused together to mean something like ‘not anymore, ‘no longer’. This is like ya no ‘not anymore’

‘morning’ to mean ‘this morning’. Note that this is common in colloquial Spanish, as well, using
something like hoy tarde ‘today afternoon’ to mean ‘this afternoon’. In (2e) both chents̈an ‘later’

Kamsá has adverbs of manner, which can be defined as adverbs that tell how somethingis done. They have the same form as adjectives, but when they are functioning as adverbs they
are not inflected, and they almost always precede the verb. In other words, when they are
functioning as adverbs, they are not inflected (i.e. do not agree with anything) but when they are
functioning as adjectives, they can agree with the noun in case, class, number, and/or evaluative.
It is not clear if all adjectives can be used adverbially; more research is needed. Figure 7.2
summarizes the adverbs of manner in Kamsá.
Kamsá wordMeaningbetsko‘fast’wenán‘slow’ts̈abá‘well’ or ‘good’podesk‘bad, ugly’wabowan‘horrible’
Figure 7.2 Adverbs of mannerThe following sentences show adverbs of manner in clauses. In (3a) and (3b) betsko ‘fast’ is
shown; in both examples it precedes the verb. In (3c) and (3d) wenán ‘slow’ is shown; in both
examples it is used twice. In (3c) wenán precedes the verb and in (3d) wenán follows the verb. In
(3e) and (3f) ts̈abá ‘good, well’ is shown, in (3e) meaning ‘to sing well’ and in (3f) that an action
165went well. In (3g) podesk ‘ugly, ugily’ is used with the verb jojwan ‘reply’ to mean that the
woman replied nastily. Finally, in (3h) and (3i) another adverb is shown: natjëmban ‘calmly,
peacefully’. In (3h) it comes directly before the verb, and in (3i) it precedes shufta ‘uchuva fruit’
the object of the verb, which precedes the verb j-as-an ‘to eat’. The adverbs precede the VP in
most examples; in (3d), however, wenán wenán ‘slowly’ follows the verb phrase bo-j-onts̈á. jwastán ‘they (two) started to follow’ and in (3e) ts̈abá ‘good, well’ comes between ki-w-at-oben
‘she is not able to’ and j-abersian ‘sing’.

Most things used as adverbs of manner are also adjectives. The following two examplesshow wabowan ‘horrible’ being used adverbially and adjectively. In (4a) wabowan goes with the
verb jwabonjnwan ‘shake’ whereas in (4b) wabowan modifies the look of the demon and has the
pejorative marker -ëj. When used as an adverb, a word cannot have an evaluative marker (or
case, class, etc), but when used as an adjective, it must have a class marker if its referent has a
class marker, and it can have an evaluative to agree with its referent. Adjectives can also have
case markers if they are at the end of the NP.

Kamsá has several adverbs of degree, which can modify adjectives, other adverbs, and/orverbs. They cannot be inflected or agree with nouns. Adverbs of degree usually directly precede
the word they are modifying. The following table shows the adverbs of degree. Most can be
translated as ‘very’ or ‘very much’. Yap, from Inga yapa ‘a lot’, can modify adjectives, verbs,
and possibly other adverbs. Mallajt can modify adjectives and nouns, and could possibly be
analyzed as a quantifier, as discussed further below. Bien from Spanish bien ‘well’ can modify
adjectives and adverbs. Unlike the use of bien in Spanish, which usually goes with verbs, bien in
Kamsá mainly modifies adjectives and verbs, but it can sometimes modify verbs, as well. People
in southern Colombia often use bien in this way, like something is ‘bien difícil’ or ‘bien bonita’.
In my corpus korent and j-abwach only modify verbs, but it is possible that they could modify
other word classes, as well.

The following examples show adverbs of degree: yap, mallajt, bien, all of which mean
‘very’ and are modifying adjectives. In (5a-c), yap modifies adjectives flakwa ‘thin’ benoka
‘close’ and wabowan, ‘horrible’. (Note: In (5c), the status of wabowan isn’t clear, because
wabowan ‘horrible’ is being used substantively, as the subject of the sentence.). In (5d) mallajt
modifies bëts ‘big’ and in (5e) bien modifies tsbananok ‘tall’.

It is important to note that bien in Kamsá is more limited than bien in Spanish. InSpanish, bien usually means well, like ella canta bien ‘she sings well.’ In Kamsá, however, bien
means ‘very’ and modifies adjectives or adverbs. Generally, you cannot say that someone sings
bien; you have to say someone sings bien ts̈aba ‘very good’. There are exceptions, however, and
sometimes bien modifies a verb as in (7) where bien modifies j-owen ‘hear, understand’.

(Chindoy 77:6)7.2.4Issues for adverbs of degree
The class of adverbs of degree is complicated for several reasons. First, the distribution isvaried: yap and mallajkt can modify both adjectives and verbs, whereas jabwach and korent
seem only to go with verbs. Bien mostly goes with adjectives, despite its primary use in Spanish
to mean ‘well’, with verbs. yap and mallajkt, which seem to be able to modify the most words
classes, can also go with nouns or nominalized verbs. In (8a) yap is modifying a nominalized
verb, meaning ‘the ones not having drunk a lot’. In (8b) mallajkt is modifying a noun, twamb
170‘hen’, to mean ‘many hens’. Section 7.6 about quantifiers discusses the possibility of mallajkt
being a quantifier.

Deictics of place morphologically are like nouns (or adjectives?). They take limited casemarkers. They can take one of two locative markers: -ok or -ents̈e; the allative marker -oy; and
the ablative marker -an. Not all deictics of place take all markers, however. Many deictics of
place can also have the intensifier prefix ka-. Many deictics can have the topic marker =na,
without a change in meaning (as far as I can tell). It’s possible that more forms exist than the
ones I provide below.
There are two forms for ‘here’: mwents̈ and moka, but it is not clear what the difference
in meaning is. It is possible one is ‘here’ (static, no movement) and the other is locative ‘towards
here’ but more research is needed. There are also two forms for ‘there’: chents̈e and choka, with
choka meaning ‘there, farther away’. When the deictics have the ablative marker, it means
motion from, and when there is a allative marker, it means motion toward. There doesn’t seem to
be a allative form of either mwents̈ or moka, however; just the usual form is used.
Figure 7.4 (on the following page) details locative adverbs in Kamsá.","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"

7.3.5Other locative words
There are other words related to location in Kamsá that do not fit neatly into anycategory. They can be nouns, adjectives, postpositions, and maybe adverbs. Some examples are:
bënok ‘far’, bekon ‘close’, tsjwan ‘above’, and stonoy ‘below’. Figure 7.5 shows these words.

used with jan ‘to go’ to mean ‘when they went far’ or ‘once they reached the farther place’. In
(15d) bënok has the allative marker -oy and is used in a command telling someone to go far
away. Finally, in (15e) there is an extra morpheme -ën, the function of which is unclear.

In (16) examples with bekon ‘close’ are shown. In (16a) bekon is used adverbially as well
as in (16b). In (16b), however, bekon has extra morphology: bekonan. It is not clear why. In
(16c), bekonan is a postposition, part of a postpositional phrase: ‘close to the waterfall’.
Similarly, in (16d) bekonan is a postposition. It is not clear why the NP in (16d) has the genitive
marker =be while the NP in (16c) does not.

Similar to the deictics for ‘here’ and ‘there’ are the words for ‘inside’ and ‘outside’, tsok
and shjok, respectively. They both end with the locative marker -ok and can also have the allative
-oy (tsoy, shjoy) and the ablative -an. They can also be postpositions, unlike the deictics. In (19a)
tsok ‘inside’ is used without other case markers, and without any NP. In (19b) tsok has the
allative marker to become tsoy because the dog is entering the inside area. Similarly, in (19c)
tsok has the allative marker -oy because the item is being brought to the inside. Also note that in
this sentence, tsoy ‘to inside’ is used to mean ‘to the house’. In (19d) shjok has the ablative
marker =an and means ‘from outside’.

This morpheme could be either ka which is perhaps a discourse particle or -k for locative followed by an
epenthetic vowel.

Kamsá has many function words that appear to have no precise or easy translation. First,I discuss four words that seem related etymologically: nÿe, nÿa, nÿets, and nÿetsá. Then I discuss
other particles and function words including: chor ‘then, thus’; chka ‘in this way, like this’;
mënts̈á ‘in this way, like this’; and aiñ ‘yes’ when being used as an intensifier. Figure 7.6
presents function words and particles.

Figure 7.6 Function words and particles7.4.1The function word nÿe ‘only’
The word nÿe is extremely common. It has three uses. It can be used in parallelstructures; it can be used alone to mean ‘only’; and it can strengthen words/phrases.
In (29a-c), nÿe is used to create parallel structures. In (29a) the first clause has the
subordinator =as and has a concessive meaning, and the second clause has the conjunction pero
‘but’. In (29b), nÿe is used to convey ‘not only, but also…’; the first clause has an inflected verb
jamnan ‘be’ while the second clause has an uninflected verb marked with the benefactive clitic
=am. Also note that jamnan ‘be’ in the first clause has the emphatic marker kwa-. In (29c) nÿe is180used twice to create parallel structures within a single clause, first before a list of nouns and then
before lempe ‘all’.

The following examples show nÿe meaning ‘only’. In these examples nÿe is used just
once, unlike the examples in (29) where it is used twice to create parallel structures. Even when
it is only used once, nÿe shows a contrast. In (30a) nÿe modifies ‘three days’, to contrast with
another person (who stayed in hell for longer than three days). In (30b) nÿe modifies
shloftŝëngbe mëntŝen ‘meat of birds’ to mean it is the only thing that he eats. In (30c) nÿe
modifies uta shloftsë to mean ‘only two birds’, i.e. he didn’t hunt more than two birds. As in the
example above where nÿe is used twice to create parallel structures, when it is used only once it
creates a contrast. In (30d) nÿe is used with the verb phrase ‘start to follow’.

To simplify the orthography, I use <k> for all voiceless velar stops. I do not use <c> in
the orthography except as part of the digraph <ch> for the voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /tʃ/.
Some authors have used <c> (at least in some lexemes) for the voiceless velar stop, presumably
based on English usage. Thus Howard (1967) wrote the name of the language as “Camsa”. .
Some authors have used <qu> for some Kamsá words to transcribe the velar stop while using
<k> for transcribing the same sound elsewhere. I do not use <q> at all in my orthography.
<s̈> for retroflex
The retroflex has been written with a variety of symbols. One problem with using <s̈> is
that it could be confused with /ʃ/ or other sounds. The alternatives, however, seem more
complicated. No one in the community uses IPA <ʂ>, and some researchers have used <x> for
the retroflex, which could be confused with other sounds.
<ll>
There is perhaps a phoneme /ʎ/, the palatal lateral approximant as discussed in 2.2.2.7.
The sound is extremely rare, but there are a few words where it exists, such as mallajt (IPA
maʎaxta) ‘many’. I use <ll> for this sound because every Kamsá speaker also speaks Spanish,
where the sound [ʎ] is written <ll> and it is easier than using the IPA [ʎ].
<nd> for /nd/
I use <nd> instead of <d> for /nd/ for two reasons. First, I want to show the
prenasalization in the orthography. Second, I want to be able to distinguish between older loan
words that were borrowed as / nd/ from Spanish /d/ and newer ones that are borrowed as /d/.
Finally, to conclude this chapter, I offer one last note about the phonology. Although
words can end in consonants, the vowel /a/, often reduced to [ɨ], is often added to the end of
words. It does not seem to be grammatical. It can only be added to consonant final words. Words
that end in stressed /a/ cannot lose that /a/. In this dissertation, I gloss this added /a/ as EPE for
epenthetic.","[65, 66]"
"95It is interesting to note that there is a contrast between singular, plural, and dual first
person and no contrast between inclusive and exclusive plural first person, a common feature of
many languages in the area.
Additionally, there are optional suffixes that show that the subject of a verb is plural or
dual (-ang and -at, respectively). Although these suffixes can co-occur with number marking
prefixes, they are often used when the number marking prefixes are not present.
The following sentences show verbs marked with the first person plural prefix bs- (often
pronounced [fs-], perhaps because of different dialects or free variation). In (9a), the verb
jamnan ‘be’ is marked with the prefix bsë-, without any overt (pronominal) subject included in
the clause. In (9b), on the other hand, the first person plural pronoun bëng is present in the
clause, and the verb jets̈an ‘lose’ is marked with bsë- to agree with it. Similarly, in (9c), japasar
‘pass, be’ is marked with bsë-, indexing the first person plural pronoun bëng.

Another option is for the verb to index only first person without indexing plural. In (11),
the first person prefix së- indexes the first person plural subject bëng on the verb j-ab-an ‘leave’.
It does not index number, only first person.

Whereas the useof this prefix indexes both (second) person and (plural) number, it is possible for a verb agreeing
with a second person plural subject to index just one or the other feature (as is the case with first
person plural subjects, 4.2.4). Thus, a verb that agrees with a second person plural subject can
simply be marked for second person with ko- or for plural with mo-. In (12a) the conquistadors
are telling the Kamsá people that they (the Kamsás) will build a chapel in a certain spot. The
prefix s̈mo- identifies the second person plural subject ‘you (pl)’, otherwise unspecified in the
clause. In (12b) the second person plural pronoun tsëngafta7 is used. (Note: the pronoun is
usually tsëngaftang, as -ang is the plural suffix on nouns, pronouns, verbs, and adjectives.)

It is important to note that s̈mo- is confusingly the same morpheme as the composite for a first

screaming at me’ would both have s̈mo-.
This is discussed further below, but for now these morphemes are summarized below:

4.2.7First person dual marking
There is no specific verbal marker to indicate first person dual subjects. That is, no prefixencodes both first person and dual number. First person dual subjects can be indexed with the
dual marker bo-, the first person marker së-, and bsë-. It is possible that such subjects can
alternatively be marked with the plural marker mo-, but I do not have examples of mo- marking
first person dual in my data.
In (14a), the verb j-wabw-an ‘cook’ is marked with the dual marker bo-, agreeing with
the first dual pronoun bëndat in the same clause. In (14b), the two verbs jashjango ‘arrive’ and
jatay ‘spend the night’ are marked with the dual marker bo-. Here, there is no overt subject, but
the subject is understood to be first person (dual) since the sentence belongs to a text in which a
man is planning with his brother. In (14c), the verb jan ‘go’ is marked with së-, the first person
marker. Here, the subject of the verb is overtly expressed and seen to be dual: is ats̈ i ats̈be bemb
‘my daughter and I’. In (14d), there is the prefix bs- for a dual subject.

4.2.8Second person dual: s̈oSecond person dual has the marker s̈o-, but it can also be indexed with the dual markerbo-. It is possible that such subjects can alternatively be marked with the plural marker mo- or
the second person plural marker s̈mo- but I do not have examples of these in my corpus. In (15a),
both verbs are marked with s̈o- to agree with the second person dual subject pronoun tsëndat.
Also in (15b) the verb j-aman ‘sleep’ is marked with s̈o- to agree with tsëndat, whereas in (15c)
the verb is marked simply with the dual marker bo-, which does not index person. Note that in
(15a) the verb also has a dual suffix -at in addition to the second person dual prefix.

Confusingly, the prefix s̈o- is also the prefix that indexes third person singular subject
with first person object. It seems that this is homophony rather than being the same prefix. In
(16) j-apegan ‘hit’ has the prefix s̈o- to index a third person singular subject basetem ‘boy’ and
first person singular object ats̈ ‘I, me’. Object marking is discussed in 4.3.

in (17a) on j-ashjango ‘arrive’ and (17b) with jamnan ‘be’. It is possible that third person dual
subjects can be indexed with the plural verbal prefix mo- but I do not have any examples of this
in my data.

It is important to note that the prefix bo- for third person dual subject is the same as the
(optional) prefix for third person subject and third person object. In (18) bo- is on the verb jashjango ‘arrive’ to agree with the null subject (two brothers). The same prefix is on the verb jabwayenan ‘advise’ where both the Agent and the Theme are animate: wabochená ‘older
brother’ and wabentsa ‘younger brother’, respectively. Note that in this example, the theme has
the allative marker -bioy. There are two possible analyses for this. The first is homophony: bocan be third person dual or third subject and object. The other possibility is that bo- indexes the
total number of participants. Throughout this dissertation, I gloss bo- as DU-.

4.2.10 Suffixes for marking number: plural -ang and dual -at
Verbs can exhibit number suffixes in addition to the person/number prefixes. These are
the plural suffix -ang and the dual suffix -at. They are identical to the number suffixes that occur
on nouns and they are optional.
In (19a) and (19b), the verbs are prefixed with plural person prefixes with special plural
and dual markers as suffixes (-ang for plural, -at for dual). Note that the vowel /a/ in -at is
deleted when it follows another vowel.

In the following two examples, the verb exhibits the second person plural prefix s̈m-. In
(20a) the verb additionally contains a plural suffix, whereas in (20b) the verb contains a dual
suffix. These suffixes thus serve to specify the number of the referent (plural or dual). Although
prefixes are not always specific for number, suffixes seem always to be specific: -ang is always
for plural subjects, and -at is always for dual subjects.

This section (4.2) has illustrated person and number marking prefixes and suffixes on
verbs. As shown, the verb can be more specific or less specific for person or number. The
following section (4.3) will discuss object marking.
4.3Object marking on verbs
In addition to indexing subjects, transitive verbs index objects with bound, obligatoryprefixes. Although grammatical objects need not be overtly expressed as free words (whether
independent personal pronouns or full NPs), it is obligatory to index objects with verbal prefixes
allowing for a null prefix for third person referents; that is to say, first and second person objects
are marked on the verb. First person and second person (object) pronouns can co-occur with
object marking prefixes, although they are not obligatory. The object prefix is the first prefix on
the verb, followed by the subject prefix (which is itself followed by any TAM prefixes). Direct
objects are marked. When the construction is ditransitive, it is the Goal and not the theme that is
marked. This chapter focuses on morphology.
In most TAM distinctions (excluding, future and conditional), neither third person
subjects nor third person objects are overtly marked on verbs. Although the first person subject
marker and first person object marker have different forms (së- and s̈-, respectively), the second
person object marker is identical to the second person subject marker. Thus, in clauses with third
person subjects and second person objects (or with second person subjects and third person
objects), only the second person argument is overtly marked on the verb (with the prefix k-). It is
thus impossible (from the shape of the verb alone) to determine whether the second person
argument is the subject or the object of the verb.
The first person object prefix is s̈-, the second person object prefix is k- (the same as its
subject prefix counterpart), and the third person object prefix is null (Ø-). These forms are used
for all TAM distinctions. Number is not marked in any way for object prefixes. Thus, plural
objects never receive the plural marker mo-, nor do dual objects receive the dual marker bo-.
Similarly, neither the portmanteau first person plural subject prefix bsë- nor the portmanteau
second person plural subject prefix s̈mo- has an equivalent object prefix form. Plural first person104objects are marked with s̈- and plural second person objects are marked with s̈mo-.
The first person subject prefix is bo- when the object is second person (regardless of the
number of either the subject or the object). The third person singular subject prefix is also bowhen the object is third person (regardless of the number of the object). Thus, first person subject
with second object is kbo-, with k- marking the second object and bo- showing that the subject is
first person. The first person singular subject prefix is never bo- when there isn’t an object.
Object marking is usually the same for non-singular as for singular.
All of the prefixes that encode subject and object end in o-, so this could perhaps be
analyzable as something to do with transitivity, but it also appears in intransitive verbs.
Figure 4.2 (on the following page) summarizes the person marking for verbs, showing the
various possible combinations of subject and object prefixes.","[108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118]"
"In (39), the personal pronoun ats̈ has the suffix -be to show possession.

where the loan word diablo from Spanish diablo ‘devil’ has the genitive marker to show that it is
the story of the devil.

The benefactive case expresses that the referent of the noun it marks receives the benefit
of the situation expressed by the clause. The form is -am for inanimate nouns, with allomorph -m
for nouns that end in vowels as seen in (41a) and (41b). In (41a) shknen ends in a consonant and
the benefactive is the suffix -am. In (41b), bomo ‘potato’ ends in a vowel and the benefactive is
realized as -m, presumably after going through the process of deleting a from bomo + -am. The
form *bomoam does not exist.

DEM

‘The salt (is) for that potato.’
The benefactive is more common with animate nouns and the form is a composite of -bi,
an animate marker, and -am, becoming -byam. This form, -byam does not have other
allomorphs; it is the same for a noun that ends in a vowel as for a noun that ends in a consonant.
In (42a) the noun bata ends in a vowel and has the ending -byam; in (42b), the noun kes̈ ‘dog’
ends in a consonant and has the same ending, -byam.","[87, 88]"
"295: Modifiers precede modified in NPs:
“A general characteristic of most Andean languages (including Aymaran and Quechuan)
is that modifiers must precede the modified in hierarchically organized noun phrases. In some
languages, however, adjectives follow the noun whereas in other modifiers precede it” (Adelaar
2008:26).
While determiners and numerals must precede their associated head noun, adjectives can
either precede or follow the head noun.
6: Few vowels, no tone, no nasality spread:
“Andean languages are said to lack a variety of phonological traits”, including many
vowels, tone, and nasality spread (Adelaar 2008:26).
Kamsá, like many Andean languages, lacks these features. It has no contrastive tones,
nasal vowels, or nasality spread, and it has more vowels than Quechuan or Aymaran languages
typically have.
7: Voiceless uvular stop:
Many Andean languages have a contrastive voiceless uvular stop (Adelaar 2008:27).
Kamsá does not have this feature.
8: No classifier systems:
“One of the most salient characteristics is again negative, namely the absence of
Amazonian-type classifier systems (cf. Derbyshire and Payne 1990). Such classifier systems,
which are largely based on distinctions of shape, are widely found in the pre-Andean Amazonian
region, where they are subject to borrowing and imitation. They are not found in the Andes”
(Adelaar 2008:28).
Kamsá diverges from the proposed Andean typological profile in having a large
class/classifier system, with nouns having class markers and modifiers agreeing with them.
9: No gender:
“In most Andean languages, including Aymaran, Quechuan and Araucanian, gender
distinctions are not expressed morphologically” (Adelaar 2008:28).","[42, 43]"
"As discussed above, many place names end in -ok, possibly because of the locative marker.
Thus, for these nouns, the subject/object form is the same as the locative form as seen in (55a-b).
In (55a), the object tabanok ‘town’ (it is also the name for the town of Sibundoy) is the same as
the locative form in (55b).

(56a) ats̈ the first person singular pronoun has the animacy marker -bi followed by the locative
marker -ok and finally the optional vowel a. (56b) has the same structure: Carmen has the
animacy marker -bi followed by the locative marker -ok and finally the optional vowel a.

Loan words also can take the locative marker, as seen in (57) with merkadok from Spanish
mercado ‘market’.

market-LOC 1SG.FUT-EVI-VBLZ-sell

henBecause -ok is the locative marker in Kamsá, it is possible that some place names became
fossilized to end in -ok such as tabanok ‘Sibundoy’, shatjok ‘Mocoa’, and sokrok ‘Colón’ and
later, this extended to other place names like Bogotok ‘Bogotá’.
3.3.3.7 Allative
The allative in Kamsá is marked with -oy on inanimate nouns and -bi-oy on animate
nouns. The allative shows motion toward the noun and sometimes is used when the noun is the
recipient of an action. It is used without any postpositions. With nouns that end in a vowel, the
final vowel is deleted and -oy is added, as seen in (58a) where tja ‘mountain, countryside’
becomes tjoy, not /*tjaoy/ or /*tjay/. Animate nouns, as seen with some of the other cases, take
the suffix -bi before the allative marker -oy. In (58b), batá has the markers -bi and -oy and the
meaning is motion toward.","[94, 95]"

3.3.3.2 Genitive
Kamsá has a genitive marker which shows possession. Kamsá is a dependent-marking
language in that it marks the possessor, not the possessee. The genitive marker is the suffix -be
and has no allomorphs. In (34a), bata ‘aunt’ has the genitive suffix -be to show that it is her
friend. In (34b), a noun that ends with a consonant is show: bobonts ‘young man’ is bobonts-be
in the genitive, without any phonological change.

The genitive is mostly used for possession, for family members and physical objects. It
can be used for possession by a definite noun, as seen above in (34a), where it is about a
particular aunt. Nouns that are not definite or specific can also be possessed as seen in (35)
where the speaker is talking about a sound that sounds like the scream of a human or a bark of a
dog.

sometimes shbwaya is used, which is derived from the verb ‘hunt’)
The genitive can also be used grammatically with kaus (from Spanish causa) to show thereason for an event. In (36) batá ‘aunt’ has the genitive suffix to show that she is the reason for
why the speaker couldn’t leave.

The genitive can occur with common nouns (animate and inanimate), proper nouns,pronouns, and loan words. As seen above, the genitive can occur with common nouns such as
‘aunt’, ‘person’, and ‘dog’. It can also occur with inanimate common nouns. The genitive can
also occur with proper nouns, as seen in (38) where -be is attached to the proper noun Carmen.

7.4.3The function word chor ‘then, thus’
Another function word is chor. It means something like ‘then, thus’. It is extremelycommon in narratives, where many sentences begin with chká or chor. It often has -na which is
perhaps the topic marker =na or -a but I have not determined a difference in meaning between
chor, chorna, and chora. It always comes at the beginning of a clause. In (35a) chorna is at the183beginning of a clause that begins a dialogue. In (35b) and (35c) chorna is at the beginning of an
action. In (35d) chora is used in the same way that chorna is used in (35a), at the beginning of a
sentence that begins dialogue.

7.4.4The function word chka ‘in this way, like this’
Another important function word is chka ‘in this way, like this’ and, like chor, it is verycommon in narratives. In (36a) a new line, and new clause, begins with chka. In (36b), a short
dialogue between two characters in a text is shown, where one asks the other ‘Can you like that?’
and the other responds, ‘I can like that.’ (referring to tilling soil with her feet). As with (36a),
chka precedes the verb. Because chka is used frequently in narratives, it often starts the clause or
line, but it doesn’t necessarily have to. But it must precede the verb. In (36c) chka follows the
subject oso ‘bear’ and precedes the verb j-atoyeunay ‘heed’ and in (36d) chka follows the subject
yendon ‘squirrel’ and precedes the verb jamnan ‘to be’. Like many word classes, chka can take
the intensifying prefix ka- as shown in (36e).","[195, 196, 197]"

In addition to nts̈amo ‘how’, other question words can be used to form subordinate
clauses. These include nda ‘who’, ndayents̈ ‘where’, ndayek ‘why’, and ndaya ‘what’. These
subordinators are identical in form to their respective interrogatives (9.6.2). They always come at
the beginning of the clause. (8) shows a sentence with several subordinate clauses, including the
question words ndayek ‘why’, ndayents̈ ‘where’, and nda ‘who’, and nts̈amo ‘how’.

The following sentence (9) provides an example of several subordinate clauses, including
a number of question words. The main verb j-obwambay ‘tell, advise’ is inflected for third
singular distant past. Each of the following subordinate clauses starts with a question word. In
the first two (with ndayents̈ ‘where’ and ndayá ‘what’), the verb is marked with bi-, which is
perhaps a subjunctive marker. In the third subordinate clause, nts̈amo is followed by the
infinitive j-oshacheñán ‘find’. The fourth subordinate clause is really two clauses, ‘what would
happen/how it would happen’ and ‘when they collect (the) gold’. The first begins with nts̈amo
244‘how’ and the verb is inflected; the second (which is actually itself embedded within the first—
that is, it is subordinated to the subordinate clause beginning with nts̈amo ‘how’) ends with the
temporal subordinator ora ‘when’ (see 11.3.4).

10.3.2.1Subordinate clauses with ndayá ‘what’The question word ndayá ‘what’ is used to form subordinate clauses, especially in
indirect discourse or indirect questions. (10a) is repeated from (6) above and shows a subordinate
clause that starts with ndayá ‘what’. (10b) has ndaya-m. It is not clear why ndaya ‘what’ has the
benefactive marker -m in this example but it is possible that it is required for complements of
certain verbs. In (10c), ndayá ‘what’ is used together with the noun pago ‘payment’.

10.3.2.2Subordinate clauses with ndayents̈ ‘where’The question word ndayents̈ ‘where’ is used to form subordinate clauses as well. In (11a),
it is used to form a subordinate clause meaning ‘where the cathedral is now’. In (11b), it is
negated by the negator ndoka to mean ‘there is nowhere…’, perhaps an existential matrix clause
with null copula: “(there was) not [where he could be]” In (11c), the people are talking about
where to shoot the hawk who has been hunting their chickens and they say to aim for ‘where he
breathes’.

10.3.3 Temporal subordinate clauses with ora ‘when’
Temporal clauses may use the subordinator ora ‘when’, which derives from Spanish hora
‘hour, time, term’. Unlike the question words discussed in the previous sections (which come at
the beginning of the clause), the subordinator ora comes at the end of the clause. In (13a), ora is
the final element of the subordinate clause ‘when the field-owner didn’t see her’. In (13b), this
word comes at the end of the clause ‘when the deer was tired’. Sometimes the forms or, gor, or
orna may be used instead of ora (note orna in 13b, gor in 13c and 13d). (13d) shows a
simultaneous action in the past. Temporal clauses with ora can either precede the main clause (as
in 13a, 13b, and 13c) or follow the main clause (as in 13d); the order is flexible.

10.3.4 Subordinate clauses with =as
A common strategy for subordinate clauses is employing the clitic =as, which comes at
the end of the subordinate clause. It tends to attach to the verb, but it can attach to the end of the
VP. It is possibly a clause level clitic, related to the word as ‘then’ which may derive from
Spanish así ‘thus, therefore, so, like that, in this way’. The word as, however, comes at the
beginning of clauses, whereas the clitic =as comes at the end of the clause. Semantically, =as
seems to be like the Greek participle where one does not know if it is causal, concessive,
temporal, etc. It can be used for past, present and future.
In (14a) =as is on the verb j-apasan ‘happen’ (which can also mean ‘be’) and has a
causal meaning. In (14b), =as is on j-obobekon ‘get close’ for a temporal meaning, for two
things happening simultaneously. In (14c) it is on j-obebi-an ‘bathe’ for a temporal meaning, as
well. In (14d) it is on the verb j-atersi-an ‘drape’ and has a temporal meaning. In (14e) it is on
two verbs before the main verb j-atsënts̈e ‘push’. In (14f) the adversative clause has the
subordinator =as in kondbomnas ‘you having’. It is strange in that it uses pero, or that pero can
be used redundantly with =as.

The subordinator =as does not necessarily immediately follow a verb; rather, it attachesto the end of a verb phrase (which may end with something other than a verb). In (16), the
subordinator =as cliticizes to the end of the VP, immediately following the oblique phrase
plechufjw-ak ‘with (an) arrow’, following the instrumental suffix -ak. Here, =as seems to have
adversative force (‘but rather’). Given that it is following the oblique, it seems to be a phrase
level clitic rather than a phrasal clitic.

There are a few words in the language in which ɨ occurs word-initially, namely somethird person singular verb forms. The third singular present form of ‘be’ is ɨndɨmɨn ‘he/she/it is’.
This is perhaps a reduction of the vowel i- which is the most common third singular verbal
prefix.
2.2.1.4 Arguments against the high central vowel as a phoneme
An alternative analysis is that ɨ is not phonemic, but instead is either an epenthetic vowel
(to break up consonant clusters) or a reduced form of an underlyingly different vowel.
Sometimes (and especially between nasals), it is not clear whether [ɨ] is present in the word at all
(even phonetically). Thus [mɨnte] ‘today’ could also be realized as [mnte], that is, with a syllabic
nasal and [ɨndɨmɨn] ‘he/she’it is’ could also be [ndmn], [ndɨmɨn] or other various combinations
of having the high central vowel and not having it.
Although there are arguments against ɨ being phonemic, I claim here that it is a phoneme
because of the few minimal pairs and because speakers distinguish between it and other sounds.
2.2.1.5 Vowel-glide sequences and glide-vowel sequences
There are no diphthongs in Kamsá, in that it is never the case that multiple vowels form
the nucleus of a syllable. There are, however, two possible sequences of vowel-plus-glide in
Kamsá (/aj/ and /oj/), as well as four possible sequences of glide-plus-vowel (/je/, /jo/, /ja/, and
/wa/). The vowel-plus-glide sequences both contain the palatal glide /j/ as their coda; the glideplus-vowel sequences can begin with either the palatal glide /j/ or the labio-velar glide /w/,
39although there are limitations on which vowels may form the nucleus of the syllable. Kamsá
syllable structure forbids vowel sequences: any vowel sequences that could potentially occur are
broken up by the insertion of a glide.
/aj/
The sequence /aj/ has wide distribution. It can be at the beginning of a word, as in ajnan ‘heart’;
it can be at the end of a word, as in wafxaxonaj ‘lagoon’; and it can be somewhere in the middle
of a word (with a consonant forming the onset of the syllable), as in tajta ‘father’.
/oj/
The sequence /oj/ is also common. It can be at the beginning of a word, as in ojena ‘inhabitant’;
it can be at the end of a word, as in tabanoj ‘to(ward) the town’; and it can be somewhere in the
middle of a word (with a consonant forming the onset of the syllable), as in soj ‘thing’ or boja
‘man’.
/jV/
Glides can also form the onset (or part of the onset of a syllable. The palatal glide /j/ can occur
before three vowels: /e/, /a/, and /o/. That is, it may precede non-high vowels (*ji, *jɨ, *ju are not
attested). There can also be word initial onsets with j- followed by a vowel, such as the distant
past marker je-.
je: betje ‘tree’
ja: atʂbjam ‘for me’
jo: atʂbjoka ‘at my place’
joj: atʂbjoj ‘to me’
/wa/
The labio-velar glide /w/ can also precede a vowel, although it has a much more restricted
distribution: /w/ can only precede the low vowel /a/. There is no /w/ without a following vowel,
but /w/ can be word initial as seen in the word waben ‘sister of a man’.
ʃbwaya ‘hunter’
ʃekwatʂ ‘foot’
40waben ‘sister of a man’
In sum, there are four phonemic vowels in Kamsa that have wide distribution and that
contrast with one another (/u/, /e/, /o/, and /a)/. There are also two vowels whose phonemic status
is questioned, as their occurrence is predictable accept for minor exceptions (/ɨ/ and /i/). There
are several vowel-glide and glide-vowel sequences, but vowel sequences are prohibited.
2.2.2Consonants
Chart 2 displays all the consonant phonemes of Kamsá in the IPA. The forms inparenthes are borrowed sounds from Spanish and occur only in loan words.","[51, 52, 53, 54]"
"31Kamsá may have a morphological difference (namely a- vs o- after the verbalizing j-)
between these transitive and intransitive verbs but it is not clear.
14: Both subject and object can be encoded on verb:
“Some Andean languages encode both the subject and an object in a verb form” (Adelaar
2008:29).
Kamsá encodes both subject and object on the verb.
15: Distinguish between different types of objects:
“Some languages (e.g. Ika) distinguish different types of objects” (Adelaar 2008:29).
Kamsá does not have different types of objects.
16: No stative-active distinction:
“The stative-active distinction, which is attested in eastern lowland languages (e.g.
Arawakan, Tupi-Guaraní) and in languages of the Gran Chaco (Guaicuruan), has not been found
in the Andes” (Adelaar 2008:30).
Kamsá does not have this distinction.
17: Rich verbal morphology:
“In most Andean languages, as in some pre-Andean languages with an Amazonian
background (for instance, the Arawakan languages Amuesha, Ashéninka, Guajiro etc.), the
verbal morphology is extremely rich and varied” (Adelaar 2008:30). Here, switch reference is
given as one example.
It is, of course, hard to quantify verbal morphology, but Kamsá would indeed most likely
be considered to have a “rich verbal morphology” and can encode many things.
18: Nominalizing markers:
“Andean languages such as Aymaran, Quechuan and Uru-Chipaya have a set of
morphological nominalizations, which may encode relative tense and which can be combined
with case markers to form different types of adverbial clauses and complement clauses. They are
also used to form relative clauses” (Adelaar 2008:30).","[44, 45]"

prefix) for the future and conditional forms. The second person singular prefix is ko- for all TAM
distinctions. The third person singular prefix exhibits a number of forms depending on tense
distinctions: i- for progressive and future; Ø-, occasionally, for habitual (discussed below); tofor past; and ye- or yo- for distant past. Finally, the third person singular prefix can also be bo(which is the same as the dual prefix 5); this is the case usually only if the clause is transitive and
both the agent and patient are animate. It is important to note that in the future tense, first person
subjects are zero-marked, whereas in other tenses third person subjects are zero-marked.
There are several options for marking non-singular: with simply plural or dual marking
person prefixes; with plural or dual marking person prefixes in addition to plural or dual marking
It is not clear if the bo- used on transitive verbs when both the subject and object are transitive is the same as the
bo- used on verbs with dual subjects.
589suffixes; or singular marking person prefixes with plural or dual marking suffixes. For plural and
dual, person can be encoded, or number, or both. Whether the person and/or number is encoded
depends partially on pragmatics (i.e. if the overt pronoun is used or not). The first person plural
marker is bs-, but verbs that have first person plural subjects will often exhibit the first person
markers së- or Ø- instead, or the plural marker mo-. The second person plural marker is s̈m-, but
second person plural subjects can instead be marked with the second person prefix ko- or the
plural prefix mo-. The third person plural marker is always mo-. Similarly, dual subjects may or
may not be specified. Verbs with dual subjects can be marked specifically as dual with the prefix
bo- (regardless of person). Alternatively, verbs can index only the person (and not the number)
of dual subjects (së- or Ø- for first person, s̈m- or ko- for second person, but generally not i-, Ø-,
to-, or ye- for third person). Finally, dual subject referents can be indexed with the plural marker
mo-. There is no marker that encodes first person dual (as opposed to dual in other persons, or
first person in other numbers) or second person dual (as opposed to dual in other persons, or
second person in other numbers. In sum, verbs may employ a precise prefix to encode both
person and number or a less specified prefix that encodes the number but not the person of the
subject or one that encodes the person but not the number of the subject.
In addition to the set of prefixes that can encode both the person and number of the
subject, there are two number suffixes that can be added to verbs to index the (non-singular)
number of the subject: -ang for plural and -at for dual. These suffixes are the same as those that
occur on nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. In sum, there are several options for marking nonsingular: with simply plural or dual marking person prefixes; with plural or dual marking person
prefixes in addition to plural or dual marking suffixes; or singular marking person prefixes with
plural or dual marking suffixes. To determine the difference in meaning, more research is
needed. Pragmatically, these suffixes are often used when the prefix is marked only for person,
not number, and/or when the subject pronoun or noun is not overt in the clause. These suffixes
are also shown in Table 4.1.
The person and number markers are discussed for the remainder of 4.2. It is not
exhaustive, however; person/number marking can differ in other tenses/moods.","[101, 102, 103]"

To encode the cause of an event or state as a dependent clause, there are two options in
Kamsá: either the subordinator kaus ‘because’ (which is clause-final) or the subordinator porke
‘because’ (which is clause-initial) may be used. Both are loan words from Spanish: kaus
‘because’ derives from causa ‘cause’ and porke ‘because’ derives from porque ‘because’.
Whereas porke has the same grammatical function as its Spanish equivalent, kaus has a different
grammatical function: it is a subordinator in Kamsá (as opposed to a noun, as is its Spanish
equivalent).
10.3.5.1 The subordinator kaus ‘because’
The subordinator kaus, which can also be kausa or kausna, may be used to show the
cause of an event or state. In (18a), kausa comes at the very end of the clause, after the verb. The
verb is fully inflected for person and number. In (18b), it is at the end of a clause, with the verb
being inflected and marked as a subjunctive. In (18c), it also comes at the end of a clause. For
comparison, (18d) shows kausa as a postposition which follows an NP, creating the phrase
‘because of the wind’. Postpositions are discussed in 8.4. It is possible that the subordinator kaus
is clause final because of its use as a postposition.

10.3.5.2 The subordinator porke ‘because’
The subordinating conjunction porke ‘because’ from Spanish porque ‘because’ is
common in Kamsá. It is used to connect clauses, always occurring as the first element of the
subordinate clause, as in (20). The ‘because’ clause seems always to be the second clause.

Note that -ka is also the translative marker as well as one form of the instrumental marker

Indirect speech is encoded in Kamsá with a verb of speaking, followed by the thing beingtold (without any subordinators). Some common verbs used for introducing indirect discourse
are:
j-ayanan ‘say’
j-auyanan ‘say’
j-atjayan ‘ask’252j-ojwan ‘answer’
j-aparlan ‘tell’
j-akwentan ‘tell’
j-obwambayan ‘say, declare’
The following two examples show the verbs jojwan ‘answer’ and jatjayan ‘ask’, each
having an object of the VP: in (21a) kanÿe palabra ‘one word’ and in (21b) kanÿe soy ‘one
thing’.

When the one being told or asked something is first or second person, this participant is
marked in the object marking slot of the verb. In (22), the verb j-awentan ‘tell’ is marked with
the first person object marker s̈o-. s̈o- is the marker for first person objects in transitive
sentences or the goal in ditransitive sentences.

ye-.

which is confusing here because the sentence happens to be spoken by a rat, but the
Kamsá word shien ‘rat’ is used. bwenoka from Spanish bueno ‘good’ with clitic ka)
With the verbs jayanan ‘say’ or jauyanan ‘say’, the person hearing (if designated) is
marked with a allative suffix. The word order is flexible: the hearer can come before the verb, as
seen in (24a), or after the verb, as seen in (24b).

31254There are a few strategies for encoding reported speech discussed in the following
sections.
10.4.1 Paratactic reported speech
One strategy for encoding reported speech is to have the verb of speaking followed by
that which is said, without any subordinators or other indicators that two clauses are being
linked. In (25a), the verb j-ayana ‘say’ is followed by the clause detailing that which is said.

10.4.2 Reported speech using subordinators
Reported speech can be encoded with the subordinator nts̈amo ‘how’, as well as with
other question words. In (26a) the reported speech is shown with nts̈amo ‘how’ followed by the
verb j-apasan ‘happen’. In (26b) the reported speech is also shown with nts̈amo but the verb is
an infinitive. In (26c) there are two clauses of reported speech. nts̈amo is also discussed in 10.3
on subordination and 9.6.2 on questions.

10.4.3 Indirect questions (embedded questions)
Indirect questions are formed with the question word followed by the verb. The verb
often has the evidential marker j- that indicates unknown. The comparison can be shown
between (27a) and (27b) where the verb j-amnan ‘be’ in (27a) is marked with the unkown
evidential marker j- in the indirect question and in (27b) is marked with n-, the known evidential
marker, for the response.","[263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269]"

3.2.9Class 8: nouns with -iñ
The marker in class 8 is somewhere between a noun class marker and a repeater. It isalmost the same as the word for ‘fire’, inÿ, and it is used mainly for adjectives agreeing with fire,
as seen in (22) where botaman ‘beautiful’ has become botamiñ to agree with inÿ ‘fire’.

There may be other words that take this class marker, namely the words for ‘light’ and‘sun’, but more data are needed.
3.2.10 Class 9: repeaters
Kamsá has a few nouns which are repeaters4, much like in some other languages of South
America. These nouns attach to the adjective, thus acting as suffixes themselves, as in (23):
(23)yebën indëmën botaman-yebën
yebën i-nd-ëmën
botaman-yebën

‘The house is beautiful.’ (the house is a beautiful house)Thank you to Leidy Sophia Sandoval for pointing out that soy could be a repeater, and for all of our other
discussions about noun classes.
463I have only found three so far: yebën ‘house’, soy ‘thing’, and mats ‘corn’.
3.2.11 Suspect class 10: -kwa
McDowell (1994) posits that -kwa is a classifier for body parts. A few nouns that are
body parts have -kwa in the word, as a bound morpheme, and no non-body part words in the
language have this -kwa. Adjectives that agree with these nouns do not take the suffix -kwa;
however, and thus it does not seem to be a noun class, at least not one parallel to the other noun
classes. In the following sentence, derecha ‘right’ and iskyerda ‘left’ do not have a suffix -kwa to
agree with kukwach ‘hand.’ If -kwa marked nouns formed a true noun class, we would expect
derecha-kwa and iskyerda-kwa for ‘right’ and ‘left’. Because adjectives do not agree with these
nouns, I do not categorize kwa as a noun class marker but rather maybe a frozen suffix.

Note that the nouns with the -kwa morpheme end in slightly different sounds, with matskwas̈
‘ear’ and shekwats̈ ‘foot’ both ending in the retroflex and bwakwats̈ ‘arm’ and kukwats̈ ‘hand’
both ending in the retroflex affricate. This is different from all of the previous class markers,
where the marker is the last suffix without any different consonants following it.
Figure 3.1 (on the following page) summarizes the noun classes in Kamsá.","[75, 76, 77]"
"281: Complex number systems:
“Andean languages tend to have elaborate numeral systems, generally conceived on a
decimal basis, which have the potential of counting as far as a hundred thousand or even further”
(Adelaar 2008:24).
Kamsá indeed has an elaborate numeral system, but the higher numbers are perhaps
borrowed from Inga. The word for ‘one hundred’ is pats, which is from Quechuan. In forming
multiples of one hundred, the cardinal number precedes pats, e.g., uta pats ‘two hundred’.
2: Suffixes on verbs:
“Agglutinative structure with an exclusive or near exclusive reliance on suffixes for all
morphological and morphosyntactic purposes has often been mentioned as a typical feature of an
alleged Andean language type” (Adelaar 2008:25).
Kamsá is agglutinative, but it mainly has prefixation rather than suffixation (although
there are a few suffixes that can go on verbs). Note that Adelaar points out that Kamsá is an
exception in his article.
3: Free/SOV constituent order:
“Constituent order is relatively free in Andean languages, although there seems to be a
preference for the order in which subject/actor and object precede the verb (SOV)” (Adelaar
2008:26).
This holds true for Kamsá: it has very free word order. The language seems to be SOV
but because the word order is so free, and perhaps because of the influence of Spanish, it is not
clear yet what should be considered its basic word order, if anything.
4: Verb final subordinate clauses:
“In many languages, including Aymaran and Quechuan, subordinate clauses are strictly
verb-final” (Adelaar 2008:26).
More research is needed to determine if subordinate clauses are always verb-final in
Kamsá.","[41, 42]"

All verbs can have non-finite verbs as complements. These non-finite-verb complementsare not inflected for person or number, and often they have the suffix -n (this latter suffix appears208on citation forms of verbs) or the suffix -m (which is of the same form as the benefactive marker
that appears on nouns). When the verb has the suffix -m it often shows purpose. In (31a), the
verb yejonts̈á ‘begin’ is inflected for third person singular distant past and has the complement
japarlan ‘to tell’ (derived from Spanish parlar ‘to talk’). The complement japarlan has the
suffix -n.
In (31b) and (31c) the uninflected verbs show purpose and have the suffix -m, which is
the same as the benefactive clitic for nouns. In (31b) the verb japroba is inflected to index a third
person singular subject and contains a complement jonguefjwan ‘to fly’, which contains its own
complement, jtsacha-m ‘to escape’. In (31c), the verb bojas̈bwachen ‘agree’ is inflected for
person and TAM with the third person dual past prefix bo- and has the complement jwashëntsam
‘to plant corn’. In (31d) the noun shajwan ‘fruit’ has the benefactive marker -m.

When there is a verb that has a verbal complement which has a direct object, the direct
object tends to precede the complement verb, both when the object is a noun (32a) and when it is
a pronoun (32b). This is not always the case, however, as seen in (32c), where the object soy
‘thing’ precedes the subject, main verb, and complement verb. Also note that the verbal
complement jatrabajan ‘work’ precedes the modal verb jobenan ‘be able’.","[220, 221, 222]"
"The subject marker and object marker, if there is one, precede the future marker. The aspect
marker ts- can follow chan-, as can j-, but it is not clear what the difference is. As mentioned in
4.2 Subject Marking, the first person singular is unmarked in the future and conditional whereas
the third person singular is marked with i- in the future and conditional.
In (49a) and (49c), the future is shown with chan + ts and the verb root. In (49b) japten
‘rain’ is repeated from above in the present progressive tense for comparison. In (49d-g) the
future is shown with chan- and the verb root, including the j-. In (49d) the verb jan ‘go’ is
marked simply with chan- because first person singular is zero marked in the future. Similarly in
(49e) j-akwenta ‘tell’ is only marked with chan-. In (49f), j-atrabaja is marked with i-chan- for
third singular. In (49g) both verbs j-ashjango ‘arrive’ and j-atay ‘spend the night’ are marked
with the third person dual marker bo- and the future chan-. Note that j-akenta ‘tell’ and jatrabaja ‘work’ are both loanwords from Spanish, from contar ‘tell’ and trabajar ‘work’. They
have the same verbal morphology as native words.

4.4.6Conditional/speculative: chao- and tayThe prefixes chao- and tay- mark the conditional. chao- seems related to chan- and it ispossible that ch- is a separate morpheme, with ao- and an- being different morphemes.When
chao- is used, there is no person or number marking. The vowel sequence ao- in chao- is suspect
as it is the only such vowel sequence in the language.
In (50a) the verb j-amn-an ‘be’ is marked with chao- to show uncertainty. The clause also
has the particle ndok which can mean ‘maybe’. In (50b) the verbs are marked with chao- to show
a possible occurrence. In (50c), chao- also shows a possibility.

4.4.7Distant past: yeThe distant past is used in some Kamsá stories. It is never used in speech (at least in mydata). It is only used for third person, probably for pragmatic reasons, i.e. that it is only for very
distant past before a speaker or hearer was born. It is formed with i- which becomes y- before
vowels. Thus, for third person singular, distant past is ye- or yo- while for plural and dual it is ibefore the usual plural marker mo- or dual marker bo-, or simple mo- or bo- without i-.
In (52a) and (52b), the verbs j-an ‘go’ and j-ay-an ‘say’ have the prefix ye- to show
distant past for a third singular subject. In (52c) and (52d), from the Kamsá Bible, Jesus is telling
a parable and the verbs all have the prefix yo- for distant past. It is not clear what the difference
between ye- and yo- is, if any, but it is possible that yo- also functions as a passive marker as
125discussed in the next section. It seems like ye- is ‘narrative past’ that is now archaic. It appears in
older texts, in Chindoy, the Bible, and McDowell but I do not have it in any of my own texts.
The function of yo- is less clear. It could be a composite of the distant past y- with the o- that is
in many other person/tense morphemes. It could also be a composite of the third singular i- with
o-.

(Chindoy 107:1)4.4.8Passive?: yoThere is a prefix yo- which is perhaps a passive or impersonal marker. It is not commonand more research is needed to determine its function, but a few examples are provided here.
In (55a) yo- is on the verb jenÿenan ‘find’. Other morphology on the verb is different, as
well. The meaning seems to be passive. Although yo- can be a distant past marker, here it is not,
because it is found in dialogue. The other examples are even less clearly passive. In (55b), it is
on the verb j-opodenan ‘be able’ (from Spanish poder ‘be able’). Note that there is a native
Kamsa word for ‘be able’, as well, and it is possible that this word has a slightly different
meaning. In (55c), the verb could be distant past, with yo- marking distant past, or it could be a
different construction. In (55d), the subject is plural, and the verb is j-onan ‘feel’.

4.5Evidentiality: n- and j- or ØThere is a two-way evidentiality system: n- for known information and j- or Ø- forunknown information. More research is needed to determine if the form of the unknown
evidential marker is j- or Ø- because it always appears with verbalizer j- and thus could be j- + j. The evidential marker comes after the person markers and before the aspect markers. There are
several morphophonemic rules with these evidential markers, discussed below.
The marker for something known is n-. It is often used in the recent past, and never used
in the distant past11. It is almost always used in first person singular (not necessarily plural,
because first person plural could mean ‘we, the Kamsás’).
The marker for something not known is j- or Ø-. Jamioy Muchavisoy describes the
evidential system as being n- for ‘close’ and j-12 for removed (1999). In (56a), the j- shows that
the speaker is has distance from responsibility, while in (56b) the speaker is closer.","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141]"
"45A syllable in Kamsa typically consists of a single-vowel nucleus, to which may be added
up to two consonants in the onset and up to two consonants in the coda. Alternatively, the
nucleus can be a consonant, but if there are more than two consonants in a syllable, an epenthetic
high central vowel /ɨ/ is inserted.
The following words exhibit syllables containing onsets consisting of a single consonant:
betsko ‘fast’
kanta ‘four’
maʃakbe ‘lulo fruit’
sasna ‘food’
ʃaxwan ‘bean’
tabanok ‘village’
wabon ‘spirit’
xan ‘go’
The following word contains syllables with two consonants in a single onset.
stonoj ‘behind’
Vowel initial words in Kamsa are rare, but are possible, as seen by the following words.
atʂ ‘I’
enutá ‘friend’
obaná ‘dead’
uta ‘two’
2.4Stress
Kamsá words generally have penultimate stress, although there are a few cases wherestress is ultimate. Thus, stress is phonemic, not fully predictable. Stress cannot fall on syllables
other than the penult or ultima.
Some words have lexically determined ultimate stress. This is particularly common for
nouns ending in /-a/, such as wabowán ‘horrible’ and batá ‘aunt’. There is a tendency for nouns
that end in an open syllable with /a/ or /o/ or a closed syllable with /an/ to have ultimate stress,
but it is not always the case.
Stress is usually penultimate, but it can be ultimate as well. For ultimate stress, only
syllables with /a/, /o/, or /e/ as the nucleus can take stress. In the following examples, /a/, /o/, and46/e/ are in the final syllable and have stress. /i/, /u/, and /ɨ/ never have stress in the ultimate
syllable.
batá ‘aunt’
bakó ‘uncle’
ʃaxbé ‘cucumber’
Words that end with closed syllables have penultimate stress.
bastok ‘Pasto’
benach ‘path’
The high back vowel /u/ can be stressed when occurring in the penult of a word with
default penultimate stress, but there are no Kamsá words with /u/ in the last syllable.
While ultimate stress can be lexically determined, it can be morphologically determined
as well: verbs have ultimate stress in the infinitive, as in the following examples (note that the
infinitive always ends in -an).
xaxanán ‘to say’
xwaʃɨntsán ‘to plant corn’
Although this ultimate stress appears to be morphologically conditioned, it could instead
be that there is something (phonological) about final -an that attracts stress. Indeed, there are
words belonging to other classes that end in -an, which also have ultimate stress, such as
wabowán ‘horrible’.
Although there are not many minimal pairs in Kamsá (in part because words tend to be
quite long), there is at least one minimal pair in the language based on stress alone: whereas the
word ena ‘pure’ has penultimate stress, the word ená ‘seller’ has ultimate stress.
Some clitics always take the stress, namely the clitic te ‘day’, as in kada-té ‘each day’
2.5Loan phonology
Due to the influence of Spanish, Kamsá has acquired several (relatively) new phonemes,which speakers recognize as different sounds. These occur only in loanwords. Words with stops
are now being borrowed with the stop /d/ or /g/ instead of with the prenasalized equivalent. /r/
and /ʎ/ are also common and found only in loan words (from Spanish or Inga). Finally [p] (which
47also occur in Kamsá as an allophone of /b/) is recognized by speakers as phonemically distinct
when occurring in loanwords, and so could be considered a fifth loan phoneme.
2.6Morphophonemics: phonological rulesThere are several phonological rules.
Rule 1: Vowel deletion
Kamsá has no consecutive vowels within words. Whenever two vowels come together (over a
morpheme boundary), the first vowel is deleted. For example, when the allative marker -oj is
added to the noun txa ‘mountain’, /a/ in mountain is deleted.
txa + oj →txoj ‘to the mountain’
Rule 2: Vowel becomes glide
i→j/_V
If the vowel is /i/, however, the next following vowel is not deleted. Instead /i/ is a glide, /j/.
When bata has the allative marker -oj after the animacy marker -bi, the /i/ is not deleted.
bata + bj + oj → batabjoj ‘to the aunt’
Rule 3: Optional devoicing
When /b/ occurs before a voiceless consonant, it often becomes /f/ or /p/, although not always, as
seen above with [btʃend] ‘blue’, also pronounced as [ftʃe nd].
/ibs/ ‘tomorrow’ can be pronounced [ips]
Rule 4: Degemination
ʂ + ʂ →ʂ
When there are two identical consonants in a row, only one is pronounced. Thus when the first
person object marker ʂ- precedes the second person plural subject marker ʂmo- on a verb, it is
realized as ʂmo, not ʂʂmo-.","[58, 59, 60, 61]"

Figure 7.1 Common adverbs in Kamsá
Many adverbs are composites of two words, sometimes two Kamsá words, andsometimes a Kamsá word and a word of Spanish origin. Several adverbs are formed from a
Kamsá word and té ‘day’, (presumably from Spanish dia ‘day’) which is a stressed clitic,
attaching to other words; the stress is always on te. For example, mnte ‘today’ is formed from the
Kamsá demonstrative mwa and té, ‘day’. Similarly, kadaté ‘every day’ and kanÿeté ‘one day’ are
formed with kada from Spanish cada ‘each’ and te, and Kamsá kanÿe ‘one’ and te. Some
adverbs are formed from the intensifier kach, including kachiñ ‘again’ kachës ‘early’ and kachor
‘instantly’ (presumably from Spanish ahora ‘now’). One interesting composite is tonjapasaibs
‘yesterday’ formed with the Kamsá word ibs ‘tomorrow’, tonja ‘he/she went’, and pasa from
Spanish pasar ‘to spend, pass’14. Some common adverbs are loan words from Spanish, such as
mor ‘now’ from Spanish ahora ‘now’ and ya ‘already’ from Spanish ya. This chart does not
include all temporal adverbs in the language.
Sentences (1a-i) show adverbs. In all of the sentences, except (1k), (1i) and (1m), the
adverb is the first element in the clause. In (1a) kachiñ ‘again’ is at the beginning of the clause.
In (1b) mor means ‘now’. In (1c) ibs ‘tomorrow’ is at the beginning of the clause, and the verb
has the future tense. Similarly in (1d) the clause begins with tonjapasaibs ‘yesterday’ for past
tense. In (1e) and (1f) the clauses start with kanÿna ‘once’ and kanÿe te ‘one day’, respectively.
In (1g) the clause starts with kadate ‘each day’. In (1h), the clause (and the story) begins with
anteo ‘long ago’. In (1i) natsan ‘before’ goes at the beginning of the NP, meaning something like
‘the gold-before-knower’, i.e. the one who knew first where the gold was. Some of these words
can also be used adverbially as seen in the following two examples with natsan ‘before’. In (1j),
The etymology of tonjapasaibs is strange, because one would expect it to mean ‘day after tomorrow’ rather than
‘yesterday’.
14161natsan is used to refer to an event that had happened earlier, that the brother had warned him
about earlier. In (1k) natsan is used to mean ‘ahead’ or ‘fast’. In (1l) empas ‘forever’ is used. In
(1m) ya is used, in much the same way as Spanish ya ‘already’. In (1n) the clause begins with
kachor-a ‘instantly’, which is a composite of the intensifier ka-, chor, and epenthetic vowel /a/.
In (1o) moben ‘soon, quickly’ is at the beginning of the clause, after the conjunction i ‘and’. In
(1p) the word kaba ‘still’ is used. These words are not inflected at all and do not agree with
anything in class, case, evaluative, etc.

"The word being compared is marked with the benefactive -am for inanimate nouns and -byam for
animate nouns. Comparatives for phrases are similarly formed with mas and the phrase. There
are no irregular comparatives; all comparatives are formed with mas + adjective. One interesting
phenomenon, however, is that for better sometimes the language uses mas + ts̈aba ‘good’ and
sometimes mas + mejor. Similarly, worse is often mas + peor. Superlatives are formed with mas
and the adjective. The noun has no special marking.
In (15a) the adjective bna ‘tall’ is preceded by mas and tobias̈ ‘girl’ is marked with the
benefactive byam, while bobonts ‘young man’ is not marked. In (15b) wamaná ‘above’ is
preceded by mas and bwatëmbaya ‘teacher’ is marked with the benefactive biam. In the second
part of (15b) wamaná ‘above’ is preceded by mas and ndwiñ ‘owner’ (from Spanish dueño) is
marked with benefactive -byam. In (15c), there is a phrase being compared, obenana bomná226‘power-having’. In all examples, mas precedes the adjective. In (15d) más ‘more’ and ts̈abá
‘good’ mean ‘better’.

9.5Imperatives
There are two types of imperatives in Kamsá: morphological imperatives with m- andfuture as imperative.
9.5.1Morphological imperatives
Imperatives are formed with m- before the verb root. There is no other morphology. In(18a) jabo ‘come’ has m- as does j-olempia ‘clean’ (from Spanish limpiar ‘clean’) in (18b).

‘Clean these two, and eat one of the them.’ (Chindoy 94:6)
9.5.2Future as imperative
Another common way to make a command is by using the future. In (19a) the verb j-areparan ‘watch’ is marked with the second singular marker ko- followed by the future prefix228ch- as in (19b) with jatbana ‘collect’. (19c) is repeated from above and shows both strategies of
command: the morphological imperative mo-lempia ‘Clean!’ and the future as imperative with
kochjase ‘Eat!’.

2SG-FUT-eat
‘Clean these two, and eat one of the them.’ (Chindoy 94:6)
9.6Interrogatives
Word order in Kamsa is very free. Yes/no questions can have any word order. WHquestions, however, generally have the question word first with other constituents following the
question word. Adverbs can precede the question word. Sometimes the evidentiality is different
with only j- and not n-, the marker for things the speaker has seen or experienced. The verb
jamnan ‘be’ often has the prefix yo- in questions, but I have not determined the use of this prefix.
9.6.1Yes/no
Yes/no questions can have any order. They often end with the tag aiñe o ndoñ ‘yes orno?’ In (20a) the clause is verb final, whereas in (20b) the main verb jan ‘go’ is first with the
complement jenokwedam ‘eat together’ and the deictic ‘to there’ following it. In (20c) the verb
jan ‘go’ shows different morphology than the usual affirmative tonja for the third singular past.
Also, the question ends with the tag aiñe o ndoñ. In (20d) the word order is OSV and the
question ends with the particle ka. (20e) shows a longer yes/no question with an embedded
clause.","[239, 240, 241, 242]"
"Figure 1.1 Sibundoy
4In addition to the Kamsá populations within Sibundoy Valley, there are four Kamsá
resguardos ‘reservations’: two just outside Sibundoy town and two near Mocoa. Most Kamsás,
however, do not live on resguardos, but rather live in their own houses in veredas (rural areas
outside a city or town). Furthermore, there are also Kamsás who live in other cities in Colombia.
The Colombian towns and cities with Kamsá cabildos ‘indigenous governing bodies’ (discussed
further in 1.2.2) are: Bogotá, Puerto Asís, Mocoa, and Santiago. There are perhaps 100 Kamsá
families living in Bogotá. Some were forcibly displaced during the Colombian conflict and
others have moved there to seek other opportunities for work, education, and so on.
Sibundoy Valley is also home to another linguistic and ethnic group, the Ingas, who
traditionally speak Inga (ISO 639-3 inb, Glottocode inga1252), which belongs to the Quechuan
family (it is sometimes referred to as Highland Inga in the literature). The Kamsás and the Ingas
have shared this valley since perhaps the 15th century, the assumption being that the Kamsás had
inhabited the region first. There are several theories about how Inga came to be spoken in the
valley. One theory is that, when the Inca empire conquered the area in the 15 th century, some of
the local inhabitants (perhaps themselves Kamsá speakers) adopted the language of the Incas.
The current Inga language would thus represent the result of whatever diachronic changes
occurred to the earlier Quechuan language of the Inca over the past five-hundred or so years.
Another theory has it that Catholic missionaries brought Quechua as a lingua franca to use with
the natives (Seijas 1969) and thus the local indigenous people of many groups began to speak
what became today’s Inga. This is suggested by records of missionaries writing to one another to
tell each other to use Inga in southern Colombia. In the past, most Kamsás and Ingas spoke each
other’s languages, but with the growing influence of Spanish, this is increasingly less the case.
Inga is a larger language, with about 18,000 speakers in Colombia, at least according to
Ethnologue (Simons & Fennig 2018, citing Civallero 2008). (Although other sources, however,
say there are 8,000 speakers or fewer). The influences of Inga are apparent in the lexicon; Kamsá
has borrowed many words from its neighbor, as well as from Spanish.
While it is assumed that the Kamsá people have had a presence in Sibundoy since before
arrival or emergence of Inga speakers, it is not clear exactly how long they have been there,
partially because the archaeological evidence is lacking. There are theories that they came from
the north (that is, from other highland groups) and other theories that they came from the south
(from lowland groups). The traditional Kamsá belief is that they are autochthonous, having5always been in Sibundoy and indeed there is no strong evidence that they came from the north or
the south. They may have lived alone in the valley for many centuries without any particularly
strong outside contact. As mentioned, there have been Inga people living in the valley for at least
the past 500 years, though. In the 15th century, the Inca empire was very powerful to the south,
but it is actually debated whether the Incas actually conquered Sibundoy valley.
The Spanish came in 1534 and established the town of Sibundoy. Although they had a
strong administrative presence, they were unable to erase the culture of the Kamsá. This was due
to no lack of effort on the part of the Spanish. Wade Davis (1996:171) writes:
More than a century after the arrival of the missionaries, the Franciscan bishop
Peña Montenegro, frustrated by the persistence of traditional beliefs, noted that
‘this evil seed planted such deep roots in the Indians that it appeared to become
their very flesh and blood so that their descendants acquired the same beings as
their parents, inherited in the same blood and stamped on their souls.’
In his book about the missionization of the natives of Sibundoy, Bonilla (1972:14) notes,
however, that the missionaries were, in a sense, successful, because the Indians there at the time
(the Kamsás and Ingas) ultimately syncretized their religion with Catholicism, identifying their
“Sun God with the God Father, and the Moon and Earth goddesses with the Virgin Mary 1”. In
1767, the Franciscans were expelled from all of Colombia and so the area of Putumayo had less
contact with the outside world for about the next century. At the end of the 19 th century,
however, the Capuchins, a Franciscan order, arrived in southern Colombia and, in 1899 or 1900,
the Colombian government gave the Capuchins complete control over the Amazon to evangelize
the natives. They established their base for the Amazon in Sibundoy, and “they ran a colonial
theocracy unlike anything seen in the Americas since the heyday of the Jesuits. Their power was
absolute.” (Davis 1996:171). They essentially enslaved much of the native population. They built
a road connecting Putumayo to Pasto, and thus to the rest of Colombia, using the labor of the
Kamsás and Ingas.","[17, 18, 19]"
