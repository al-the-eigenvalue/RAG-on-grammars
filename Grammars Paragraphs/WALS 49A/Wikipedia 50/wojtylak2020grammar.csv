6.4SummaryGenerally, Murui has two mechanisms to distinguish syntactic functions of the core
arguments in Murui: the morphological mechanism (i.e. the overt case marking on S/A and O
arguments) (discussed in §6.2), and the syntactic mechanism (i.e. if the grammatical marking
is absent, the constituent order in which NPs occurs in relation to the predicate) (§6.3). Murui
has a nominative-accusative case marking system, and distinguishes between core and
oblique arguments. The core arguments, the subject S/A and the non-subject O are subject to
differential case marking. Core arguments can also be marked for the locative/dative case,
which can be omitted with pronouns. In Murui, it is the discourse status of the S/A and O
arguments (including their topicality and specificity) that determines whether they receive the
case markers. In addition to the core cases in the language, there are five oblique cases in
Murui: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-casual, and privative. Each has a number
of specific functions and meanings. Oblique cases do not co-occur with core-cases in a single
NP; an exception might be the ablative. The overview of core and oblique cases is given in
Table 6.3. Murui has a nominative-accusative pattern of constituent ordering – S, A followed
by O, occur before the V. The constituent order, however, allows certain flexibility.","[339, 340]"

This chapter covers the grammatical expression of non-spatial setting and spatial setting in
Murui. The structure of a Murui predicate is discussed in §7.1. This is followed by the
description of Murui non-spatial setting in §7.2: the grammatical categories which express
the timing of activity (see §7.2.1 on tense), the internal composition of activity (aspect,
§7.2.2), speaker’s attitudes towards the event (modality, §7.2.3), as well as those categories
which provide information about the source of acquired knowledge (evidentiality and
epistemic modality, §7.2.4). Spatial setting (i.e. direction and location expressed with affixes
on verb), the andative and ventive, are discussed in §7.3. The last section §7.4 offers a brief
summary.","[340, 341, 342]"
"THEREMurui repeaters are similar to repeaters in other neighboring languages (Aikhenvald, 2000:
222). The main functions of Murui classifiers are derivation of nominal stems, formation of
‘headless’ nominal modifiers, and word-class changing nominalizations. They also function
as a reference-tracking mechanism (Wojtylak, 2016a, forthcoming-d). See Chapter 4 on
Murui noun structure and classifiers.
Murui possessive construction involves the Possessor (R) which can be a noun, a full
NP, or an independent pronoun, and the Possessed (D) which is frequently a noun, and
always functions as a head. Murui possessive constructions show no marking on either the R
or the D; the R and the D are simply juxtaposed within the NP with the Possessor-Possessed
constituent order, as in (1.7):
(1.7) [LusioR yoe-faiD]NP
Lucio
metal-CLF:SHORT.THICKER
‘Lucio’s machete’
Marking of the genitive -ɨe is conditioned by the Nominal Hierarchy where -ɨe occurs with 1st
and 2nd personal pronouns, e.g. kue-ɨe (1sg-GEN) ‘mine’, and the connective ie which occurs7
with 3rd person Lusio ie (Lucio CONN) ‘Lucio’s’. Murui lacks both a verb meaning ‘have’ as
well as the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession. The expression of
possession and number are discussed in Chapter 5.
Grammatical relations are expressed through differential case marking where the
marking of core arguments is related to topicality, definiteness, and affectedness. Under
special pragmatic conditions, topical S/A subject, topical non-S/A subject, and O
(recipient/addressee) arguments can be either unmarked or marked with case. Differential
marking of the O NP arguments is illustrated by (1.8-9). Grammatical relations and case
marking in Murui are the topics of Chapter 6.

canoe-N.S/A.TOP make-LK-2sg
‘Did you make the canoe?’ (specific)Murui has a rich system of verbal morphology, that is mostly aspectual; there is only one
(future) tense marker. Example (1.10) shows numerous verbal categories expressed on the
verb joko(de) ‘wash’. They include aspectual, directional, modal, and evidential marking.
(1.10) joko-ri-zai-aka-ñe-itɨ-kue=dɨ
wash-DUR-ANDTV-DES-NEG-FUT.LK-1sg=CERT
‘I WILL not want to go washing.’
Murui has one evidential, the reported =ta. Witotoan languages differ with respect to
expression of evidential meanings, but they do appear to share at least one evidentiality value
– the reported evidential. In that respect, the Witotoan languages are similar to other
languages spoken in the Caquetá-Putumayo region, such as Boran (Wojtylak, forthcoming-c).
Languages located to the north usually have more ‘elaborate’ systems of evidentials
(Aikhenvald, forthcoming-b; Carlin, forthcoming; Stenzel & Gomez-Imbert, forthcoming).
The Murui predicate structure as well as the expression of non-spatial (TAME) and spatial8
(andative and ventive) settings on the verb is discussed in Chapter 7.
Murui has one type of morphological valency-reducing mechanisms – the passive,
and two types of valency-increasing mechanisms – the causative and the double causative.
Murui passive construction puts the underlying O argument into S function and places
underlying A argument in a peripheral (oblique) function. Reflexive and reciprocal meanings
are periphrastic expressions that involve ‘headless’ nominal modifiers and the possessed
noun abɨ ‘body’. The reciprocal meanings are expressed with the bound form koni‘between’. A prototypical Murui causative derivation applies to an S argument and places it
in a derived O function. The causative carries the possibility of being applied twice (double
causative). It applies to both underlying intransitive and transitive clauses forming derived
extended transitives. Valency-changing mechanisms are discussed in Chapter 8.
Murui adjectives belong to the open word class, and share various properties with
verbs and nouns. With verbs, they share a limited set of verbal affixes, such as the attributive
markers, e.g. jano-re-d-e (small-ATT-LK-3) ‘(it) is small’. They can also take classifiers to
form ‘headless’ nominal modifiers. As such, they take no verbal marking, e.g. ebi-fue (niceCLF:STORY) ‘nice story’. Additionally, Murui has a small closed word class that consists of afew ‘underived’ adjectives (including mare ‘good’, aare ‘long’, aiyo- ‘big’, jaka- ‘old’, and
komo- ‘new’). They have different morphosyntactic properties than those that belong to the
open word class. The majority of Murui comparative constructions are monoclausal, where
the PARAMETER of comparative construction (usually an adjective) is followed by the
STANDARD and standard marker (S-MARK) of comparison. In (1.11), what is being comparedis naiñaiño ‘she’. The STANDARD is what naiñaiño is compared against, kue ‘me’. The
property that is compared (PARAMETER) is the adjective jano- ‘small’, that is further modified
with the P- MARK eo ‘very’. The marker of the grammatical function of the STANDARD, the SMARK, is baaɨfemo ‘over there, ahead of’.","[31, 32, 33]"

4.1Noun structureThe Murui noun phrase (NP) can be defined as a grammatical constituent that functions as an
argument of a predicate. Murui noun phrases can also head intransitive predicates. The head
of a simple NP can be a single noun, which can be modified by other nouns, adjectives,
quantifiers, pronouns, demonstratives, interrogatives, and number words. The head of an NP
follows the modifier, as illustrated in (4.1-2). Adjectives always follow the head noun, as
illustrated in (4.6) and (4.11) further in this section.

jɨkoHEAD]NP

‘this dog’(4.2)[atava
rɨ-ñoHEAD]NP
chicken woman-CLF:DR.F
‘female chicken’More complex NPs and NP heads include so-called ‘HEADLESS’ NOMINAL MODIFIERS, which
are formed from other word classes by means of classifiers (suffixes); noun head is not stated.
This is illustrated with the classifier-repeater -ko for ‘dog’ (from jɨko ‘dog’) in (4.3). These
also include nominalizations (see §3.1.4) and possessive constructions (see §5.1.1), as in
(4.4).

Structurally, Murui nouns are less ‘complex’ than verbs. They allow up to three structural
positions, which can be filled simultaneously, and are marked only once. The structural
positions are: 140
(a) Classifiers (discussed in this chapter),
(b) Number (plural, kinship plural, collective, see Chapter 5),
(c) Case (topical S/A, topical non-S/A subject, locative, instrumental, ablative,
benefactive-causal, and privative, see Chapter 6 on grammatical relations).
The structure of a Murui noun illustrating noun slots is given in Scheme 3.1 in §3.1.1.
‘Headless’ nominal modifiers are formed with various members of open, semi-closed, and
closed word classes by means of classifiers. They can take further number and case marking
(see §3.1.1). An illustrative example of a nominal with an adjectival root, followed by an
animate classifier and a case marker is given in (4.5) (see also §9.1 on NPs with adjectival
roots).
(4.5)uiño-t-o?PRED
mare-ñaiñua-naNP:O
good.ATT-CLF:PR.F.PL-N.S/A.TOP know-LK.2sg
‘Do you know (those) beautiful (females)?’Within an NP that contains a modifier followed by a noun, modifiers usually do not agree
with the head noun (but see also (5.105) in §5.2.2); modifying elements are always marked
with the generic classifier -e, regardless of the number or animacy of the noun, as illustrated
with the demonstrative bai- ‘that’ in (4.6) below:140There are a number of dependencies between noun classes, number, and classifier types in their co-occurrence (see §4.2.2.3 and §5.2).","[202, 203, 204, 205]"
"117
3.1.1NounsPrototypical Murui nouns are heads of NPs that function as arguments of a predicate; they
can also function as heads of intransitive predicates. Nouns distinguish the following
grammatical categories: classifiers (including animate classifiers, which distinguish natural
gender, feminine and masculine; classifiers are discussed in Chapter 4), number (plural and
collective, see §5.2), and case (topical S/A, non-S/A markers, locative, ablative, instrumental,
benefactive-causal, and privative, see Chapter 6). 91 All hese grammatical categories are
expressed with bound forms. An example of a noun with all positions filled is given in (3.1):
(3.1) oogo-do-nɨaɨ-do
banana-CLF:POINTED-COLL-INS
‘by/with the bananas’
Depending on the type of noun, classifiers may or may not be obligatory. The category of
number is always optional. Case marking is obligatory (but see §6.2 on differential case
marking).
Noun structure is less complex than the structure of Murui verbs and adjectives. Noun
categories are marked just once on a noun or an NP. A minimal nominal word is usually
disyllabic, often accompanied by a classifier. Nouns occurring with classifiers can consist of:
A. BOUND NOUN ROOTS obligatorily followed by classifiers, such as rɨ-ño 92 (womanCLF:DR.F) ‘woman’,91Murui, similarly to other Witotoan languages, does not have the category of nominal tense, as in somelanguages spoken to the north, such as Tariana (Arawak) spoken in the Vaupés (Aikhenvald, 2012: 159-163).
92The word rɨño originates in the verbal root rɨ(te) ‘eat meat’ (cf. in the Murui mythology, the word rɨaɨ, withthe plural marker -aɨ, refers to carnivorous beings and the non-Witotos).","[141, 142]"
"1.1Linguistic profile of MuruiMurui has a relatively simple system of six vowels and seventeen consonants. The
consonantal phonemes include six stops (*p, b, t, d, k, and g), five fricatives (f, v, h, *s, and z
), two affricates (ch and y), three nasals (n, ñ, and m), and a flap (r). The voiceless labio-labial
stop *p is a marginally occurring phoneme in Murui (but still preserved in other dialects of
‘Witoto’); the voiceless apico-alveolar fricative *s, which occurs in the speech of younger
speakers, is a direct result of the Spanish influence on Murui. The vowel inventory is typical
of other languages from northern South America. All the vowels ‒ i, e, a, o, u, and ɨ ‒ have
long counterparts that are restricted to the word-initial syllables only. The high central4
unrounded vowel ɨ is an areal feature common to all languages spoken in the CaquetáPutumayo region as well as in many to the north (most Tucanoan and Carib languages)
(Aikhenvald, 2012: 109). Unlike other Witotoan languages, Murui is neither tonal, nor does it
have a complex accent system. 2 Morphophonological processes in the language involve,
among others: assimilation, voicing, vowel lengthening and shortening, and partial
reduplication. The syllable structure is of the (C)V type. Murui phonology is the focus of
Chapter 2.
In terms of language structure, Murui is nominative-accusative with head marking (on
the verb) and some elements of dependent marking (case). The language is largely
agglutinating, suffixing with some fusion. Murui has no prefixes, which distinguishes it from
other Witotoan languages (Fagua Rincón & Seifart, 2010; Wojtylak, 2016d). 3 Constituent
order within a clause is frequently determined by pragmatic factors but there is a tendency for
it to be predicate final (SV/AOV).
Murui has three open lexical word classes: nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Semi-closed
word classes are adverbs, time words, and number words. There are seven closed word
classes; these are quantifiers and intensifiers, pronouns, demonstratives, interrogative content
words, the connective ie, adpositions, and interjections. Murui word classes share numerous
properties; for instance, many of the members of the open, semi-closed, and closed word
classes can be used as heads of intransitive predicates. For instance, in (1.1), the head of the
predicate is the verb ɨba(de) ‘buy’; in (1.2) it is the noun uzuma ‘grandfather’; in (1.3) it is2With regards to the lack of tonal distinction, all ‘Witoto’ dialects are similar to Nonuya but are unlike Ocainaand other languages of the People of the Centre cultural area. Note however that only Murui and Mɨka have
fixed accent position (word-initial). Mɨnɨka and Nɨpode appear to have different patterns of accent placement.
This has lead other researchers to hypothesize that it could possibly be indicative of tonal contrasts in Mɨnɨka
(Ávila, 2016; Seifart & Fagua Rincón, 2009).
3Witotoan languages differ in terms of the number of prefixes on the verb (Wojtylak, 2016d).","[28, 29]"

6.2.1.1 S and A core arguments
The A and S arguments, together with the O arguments, form basic relations in Murui. Unlike
a prototypical object, a prototypical transitive subject is recognized as being in the A function
if it is “(…) that argument whose referent could initiate or control the activity (if anything
could)” (Dixon, 2010b: 76). There are a number of morphological and syntactic criteria in
Murui that identify the subjecthood of S and A arguments:
A. Verbal suffixes cross-reference the subject (S/A) on the predicate, e.g.:
(6.6) dɨno=koni
kokoS bɨta-da-tɨ-kokoPRED
AT.CLF:SP.PLACE=LOCAL1
1du.m lie.on.ground.TH-BODY-LK-1du.m

(6.7) nai-mɨeA
kueO ɨnɨ-ta-t-e PRED
ANA.SP-CLF:PR.M 1sg
sleep-CAUS-LK-3
‘He made me fall asleep.’
Murui nouns are usually not marked for number if the plural reference is retrievable from the
context (see §5.2). The form of the 3rd person pronominal subject marking is always -e
expressing any kind of singular or plural meanings. In (6.8) the marker -e expresses the
group’s plurality of uzutɨaɨ ‘grandfathers’. When the animacy of S/A NP is emphasized and
the argument is individualized, the predicate takes 3rd dual and plural pronominal subject
markers, as in (6.9).

‘The hospital inhabitants (lit. those of the healing house) wanted to go (there) badly.
Well, let us (two males) go to them!’
B. An NP that functions as S/A subject, can be either zero-marked or it can take the enclitic
=dɨ. O arguments are never marked with =dɨ. In (6.10), jɨko ‘dog’ is in contrastive focus (the
factors conditioning the S/A focus marking are outlined in §6.2.1.2):
(6.10) gatoS

cat.Sp come-NEG-LK-3 dog=S/A.TOP come-E.NMLZ
‘It was not the cat that came. It was the dog (lit. A cat didn’t come. The dog came.)’
C. The typical constituent order is SV and AOV where the S and A arguments are pre-posed
to the clause-final predicate. In the transitive clause of the AOV type, the placement of the O
argument is restricted and O cannot precede the A NP argument, unless it is marked for the
topical non-S/A subject case. Compare (6.11a) (with the AOV constituent order and no overt
case marking) with (6.11b) (with the AVO constituent order and the overt case marking). In
(6.11b), akiena ‘this’ is topical.

D. Murui has the S/A pivot where the S and A arguments are a common argument of two
linked clauses (so-called the ‘nominative-accusative’ S/A pivot), as in (6.12):
(6.12) PedroA nai-ñaiño-naO
kɨo-d-ePRED
Pedro ANA.SP-CLF:PR.F-N.S/A.TOP see-LK-3
‘Pedro saw her (and he) got scared.’ØS jakɨ-nai-t-ePRED
(he) scared-BECOME1-LK-3E. In addition to the criteria for recognition of the S/A subject outlined above, there are also
more associations between the S and A arguments. In Murui, the referent of both S and A is
2nd person in canonical imperative constructions (see §11.1). 191 Usually, the S and A
arguments are not explicitly stated, and they are understood from the context. The imperative
in (6.13) below is an example of an intransitive clause where the S argument is not stated.
The reported command in (6.14) illustrates a transitive clause; the A argument is covert:
(6.13) beno-mo
(Ø)S bii!PRED

‘(You) come here!’ (shouting at a boy running in front of the house)

‘“(You, two males) do not open this up!’ (he) said.’
6.2.1.2 Differential S/A case marking
The form of pronouns for S, A, and O arguments is the same for all the persons. There is no
morphological distinction between marking of NPs in S function of intransitive clauses, in A
function of transitive clauses, and in VCS function of verbless clauses. This is illustrated in
(6.15-17) below. (6.15) is an example of an intransitive clause with the independent pronoun
kue ‘I’ functioning as S; in the transitive clause in (6.16) kue functions as A; in the verbless191Such association applies equally to languages with accusative and with ergative marking of syntacticrelations. It is not treated as one of the criteria for S/A subjecthood in the language but merely as a confirmation
of one of a linguistic universal (Dixon, 2012).","[297, 298, 299, 300]"
"270
bound pronouns and classifiers (see §3.1.2 and §3.1.4). 188 The O arguments are not crossreferenced on the verb. The forms of personal pronuons and pronominal subject markers (for
S, A, and O arguments) remain always the same. This is illustrated in the sentences (6.1),
(6.2), and (6.3) below. Forms of the S cross-referencing markers on intransitive predicate are
the same as marking of A subjects in transitive clauses, as in (6.1-2). (6.2-3) illustrate that O
arguments are not cross-referenced on the verb, and that the pronouns are identical to the S/A
cross-referencing markers.

pragmatic conditions:

‒ O arguments can be unmarked or marked with the topical -na,
‒ certain types of O arguments in addressee function can be either unmarked or marked
with the dative/locative -mo.","[294, 295]"
"Some full nouns, such as nokae ‘canoe’, cannot be further specified for classifiers. The
structure of a Murui noun is outlined in Scheme 3.1. Depending on the semantics of the noun,
all the structural positions may or may not be filled simultaneously (see discussion below).

proclitics in rapid speech, e.g. kue jɨko [ˈkue ˈhɨko] or kue=jɨko [ˈkweˌhɨko] for ‘my dog’ (see
§2.1.3.3). The root can be followed classifiers in position 2. Usually there is just one
classifier for nouns for human referents. Such nouns take gender-sensitive animate classifiers
-ma (masculine) and -ño (feminine), as in evu-ño (sister-CLF:DR.F) ‘sister’. On nouns with
inanimate referents, up to three classifier positions can be filled simultaneously, as e.g. ñekɨna (chambira-CLF:TREE) ‘chambira palm tree’, ɨfo-gɨ-tɨraɨ (head-CLF:OVAL-CLF:FUR) ‘head
hair’. Generally, nouns do not allow variable ordering of suffixes, but in a few cases re-119
ordering of classifiers results in a meaning difference (see §4.4).
Murui has optional number marking system on the noun (slot 3). Singular is formally
unmarked, plural, kinship plural, and collective are formally and functionally marked. All
three non-singular numbers have the same origin (see §5.2). Frequently, if the non-singular
referents of the noun are highly animate, or its non-singularity is important in discourse, the
noun will be marked for number. There are some dependencies between number and
classifiers in their co-occurrence. For instance, the kinship nouns, when marked with kinship
plural -tɨaɨ, cannot occur with an animate classifier, as in (3.2c). (3.2c) further shows that the
masculine is the functionally unmarked gender in the language. The meaning of (3.2c) is
‘grandparents’ (with ‘grandfathers’ being subsumed within ‘grandparents’) but not
‘grandmothers’: 93
(3.2)a. uzu-ma (grandparent-CLF:DR.M) ‘grandfather’
b. uzu-ño (grandparent-CLF:DR.F) ‘grandmother’
c. uzu-tɨaɨ (grandparent-KIN.PL) ‘grandfathers, grandparents’To express the meaning of ‘grandmothers’, one can say either uzu-ño-nɨaɨ (grandparentCLF:DR.F-COLL) or uzu-ñuaɨ (grandparent-CLF:DR.F.PL). Forms such as uzu-ma-tɨaɨ anduzu-ño-tɨaɨ are ungrammatical, cf. (3.2c).
The system of case marking (topical non-S/A, locative, ablative, instrumental,
benefactive-causal, and privative) in slot 4 consists mainly of suffixes and cannot be filled
simultaneously. 94 The topical S/A marker =dɨ is an enclitic that occasionally occurs as an
independent phonological word in its own right (see §6.2.1.1 and §13.4).","[143, 144]"

possibilities (they cannot take number marking), and, as such, they can head an intransitive
predicate and occur as arguments of a predicate. In (5.30-32) further this section, they are
case-marked and occur as arguments of a predicate. In (5.21-22) they function as arguments
of a verbless clause. Additionally, in (5.22) the pronoun oo ‘you (2sg)’ followed by the
genitive -ɨe heads a predicate.

6.2.2Oblique argumentsOblique cases mark any non-core arguments and their marking cannot be omitted. Murui
distinguishes between five oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental (with comitative
overtones), benefactive-causal and privative. There is also a genitive form, which is not
strictly a case as it marks relations within the NP rather than grammatical relations (see
§5.1.1.2). All nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers distinguish oblique cases. Adverbial
demonstratives that take the suffix -ne (see §3.3.3) are unique in that they show limited case
marking possibilities, as well as differ in terms of locative and ablative marking. The
nominalizations are unique in that their privative forms can either be -(ñe)no or
-(ni)no (see §10.2.5), whereas the privative is marked with -(ni)no elsewhere (see §6.2.2.5 for
details). The most restricted case is the privative marking. Murui lexicalized adverbial
demonstratives that contain the formative -ne (see §3.3.3) occurs with the ablative and the
instrumental only. Murui oblique cases are presented in Table 6.2.

"5.1Possession ‒ general characteristicsMurui possessive construction involves the Possessor (R) which can be a noun, a ‘headless’
nominal modifier, or an independent pronoun, and the Possessed (D) which is frequently a
noun or a ‘headless’ nominal modifier, and functions always as head. Both the R and the D
can be modified by a demonstrative and an adjective. There is no marking on the R and the
D; they are simply juxtaposed within the NP with the Possessor-Possessed constituent order.
(5.1-2) are examples of a noun and a pronoun in the R functions:
(5.1) [LusioR yoe-faiD]NP
Lucio
metal-CLF:SHORT.THICKER
‘Lucio’s machete’
(5.2) [kueR yofue-raɨ-ñaiñoD]NP
1sg
teach-AGT-CLF:DR.F
‘my (female) teacher’
NP possessive constructions are marked in the same way regardless of the nature of R (that
is, R can be a pronoun or a noun (either a common proper, or kinship noun, with either
human, animate, or inanimate referents, loans, etc.) (see §5.1.2). Such possessive
constructions function as arguments of predicates, or head an intransitive predicate.
Verbless possessive constructions involve the R (and, often, the D) followed by the
connective ie that refers to the R anaphorically. Examples (5.3-4) are illustrative of this. (5.3)
is verbless possessive construction with the R and D elements expressed in the clause. (5.4) is237
a verbless possessive construction with the omitted D. Verbless possessive constructions,
such as (5.3), are frequently used as answers to the question bu-e bai-e? (Q1-CLF:G that.FSHCLF:G) ‘what is this? (lit. what - that)’ while constructions such as in (5.4) are used as repliesto buu ie bai-e? (Q1 CONN that.FSH-CLF:G) ‘whose is this (lit. who his/hers - that)?’ (see
§5.1.3.3).

Additionally, Murui has a construction which involves a morphological process of affixation
where the genitive -ɨe is applied to pronouns. Such form function as arguments of verbless
clauses; they can also head an intransitive predicate. The marking of the genitive is
conditioned by the Nominal Hierarchy, where the 1st and 2nd person pronouns (singular, dual,
and plural) in R function are marked with -ɨe, as in (5.5). 3rd person pronouns referring to the
R are marked with the connective ie, as in (5.6). The genitive marker is discussed in §5.1.1.2.

marked with the locative case (see §5.1.3.2). Another way to express possessive meaning is

buy-DES-LK-3Murui nouns can take up to three suffix slots that generally can be filled simultaneously with
classifiers (up to three classifier positions), number (plural, kinship plural, and collective),
and case marking (topical S/A and non-S/A subject markers, locative, ablative, instrumental,
benefactive-causal, and privative) (see Chapter 6 on grammatical relations). The nonsingularity of plain noun forms is often determined by context. Often, number marking is
expressed when nouns are pragmatically salient or their referents are highly animate. Perhaps
one of the most salient features of Murui, is its large multiple classifier system, that consists
of more than 80 ‘established’ classifiers that denote among others, form, size, function, and
quantification. In this respect, Murui is similar to other neighboring languages spoken in the
Caquetá-Putumayo region as well as those languages spoken in the vicinity of the Vaupés
linguistic area to the north (among which the East Tucanoan and Makú languages, as well as
an Arawak language, Tariana) (Aikhenvald, 2000: 204-241; Seifart, 2005). A few examples
of Murui classifiers are given in (1.4) (classifiers are in bold).

The classifiers are suffixes that can be defined as sets of morphemes used in various

slot. They have non-human referents only. In (1.6) -dora is ‘repeated’ from the Spanish form

Murui ‘headless’ nominal modifiers can have many members of other word classes
(open, semi-closed, and closed) as their base. Such formations can occur within an NP as
well. This is illustrated in (3.3) where the ‘headless’ nominal modifier daje ‘one’ modifies the
head noun ananeko ‘maloca (traditional roundhouse)’:
(3.3)[da-je
one-CLF:G
‘one maloca’anane-ko]NP
maloca-CLF:COVERIn discourse, such NPs with the overtly stated heads are not common. Instead, ‘headless’
nominal modifiers are ‘directly’ accompanied by classifiers, and the head noun is not stated.
An example of a classifier used on an adjective is presented in (3.4), which is a functional
equivalent of (3.3) above. ‘Headless’ nominal modifiers used in such a way share syntactic
functions and grammatical categories with prototypical nouns (classifiers, number, and case).
The referents of (3.4), as well as (3.5), are understood from the context. The ‘headlessly’ used
nominal nai-gɨ (ANA.SP-CLF:OVAL.BIGGER) ‘that (egg)’ in (3.5) is further marked with case,
the topical non-S/A subject marker -na.

In (3.6), the verbal root du ‘chew coca’ is nominalized by means of the animate masculine
classifier -mɨe, and is further case-marked with the topical non-S/A subject marker -na.
In Murui, agreement is indicative of the distinction between an NP and a clause.
Within an NP (modifier followed by noun), modifiers do not agree with the head noun.
Modifying elements are always marked with the generic classifier -e, as illustrated in (3.3)
above. Classifiers occur obligatorily as agreement markers only in equative clauses.
Examples (3.7-8) below are juxtapositions of two nominal forms, and, therefore, a full

Semantically, the vast majority of the nouns have concrete meaning referring to animals,
objects, plants, food, and the like. On morphological grounds, Murui nouns are divided into
A. NOUNS WITH HUMAN REFERENTS and B. NOUNS WITH NON-HUMAN REFERENTS. They are
discussed in turn:
A. NOUNS WITH HUMAN REFERENTS – most nouns with human referents take animate
classifiers that distinguish natural gender (masculine -ma and feminine -ño) but not all.
Generally, gender of nouns with human referents depends on the referent’s sex, but certain
inanimate beings can be assigned to natural gender by other mechanisms, such as
mythological associations (Wojtylak, 2015a). All types of nouns with human referents can be
possessed (see §5.1.4 on ‘possessibility’ of nouns). Kinship nouns have special vocative122
forms, as well as a separate kinship plural marker. Given their distinctive morphological
possibilities, we distinguish several separate classes of nouns with human referents:
A1. NOUNS MARKED WITH ANIMATE CLASSIFIERS – these are nouns with human referents that
are obligatorily marked with animate classifiers. They distinguish between singular (formally
unmarked), plural -aɨ, and collective -nɨaɨ numbers. These are nouns such as rɨ-ño (womanCLF:DR.F) ‘woman’ and ɨɨi-ma (man-CLF:DR.M) for ‘man’. For instance, rɨñuaɨ (womanCLF:DR.F.PL) is marked for plural; rɨ-ño-nɨaɨ (woman-CLF:DR.F-COLL) is marked forcollective.
A2. NOUNS WITH NO ANIMATE CLASSIFIERS – these are nouns which do not take animate
classifiers. This is a residual category that includes all types of nouns that have human
referents, e.g. urue ‘child’, kome ‘person’, konirue ‘youngster, fellow’. They can take plural
-aɨ and collective -nɨaɨ marking, e.g. uru-iaɨ (child-CLF:G.PL) ‘children’.
A3. KINSHIP NOUNS – a closed subclass of nouns with human referents that denominate
kinship relations, such as evu-ño (sister-CLF:DR.F), biya-ma (mothers.brother-CLF:DR.M). For
a few of these nouns, the masculine form is functionally unmarked while the feminine is
always marked with the drivational animate classifier -ño, as in enaize ‘grandson’ (cf. enaizeño for ‘granddaughter’), jɨfai ‘father-in-law’ (cf. jɨfai-ño for ‘mother-in-law’). Kinship nouns
have a special category available for them, the vocative. The vocative is formed by omitting
animate classifiers, which is an obligatory category elsewhere. This is illustrated in (3.9) with
uzu! ‘grandparent!’ (the usual form is either uzu-ño (grandparent-CLF:DR.F) for ‘grandmother’
and uzu-ma (grandparent-CLF:DR.M) for ‘grandfather’).","[144, 145, 146, 147]"
"4.5.2Functions of repeatersThe set of Murui repeaters is potentially open as any noun can occur in that position. Their
referents can be animals and inanimate objects but not humans. Repeaters do not classify
nouns but are a semantically residual class that occurs in the classifier slot (see §4.2.2.6).
Murui repeaters are used when a speaker wishes to individualize something for which there is
no classifier (Zubin & Shimojo, 1993). In addition to ‘headlessly’ used modifiers with
repeaters, such as bi-ko (this.CTS-CLF.REP:DOG) ‘this (dog)’, repeaters can also occur on
nouns having derivational functions (without changing word classes) just like other
classifiers. See an example of the repeater -tava (cf. atava ‘chicken’) in (4.77-78) in §4.2.2.6.
This function of repeaters can also have a broader meaning (encompassing other types of
nouns from the same semantic field, e.g. -dodo in uidodo ‘mosquito’ and ‘repeated’ in iudodo
‘mosquito (type)’, azidodo ‘mosquito (type)’, zurudodo ‘mosquito type (cf. zuruma ‘tapir’ in
Mɨnɨka), and functioning as agreement markers on the clause level, as in (4.110):
aiyo-tavaVCC
(4.110) bi-tavaVCS
this.CTS-CLF.REP:CHICKEN big-CLF.REP:CHICKEN
‘This (chicken) is big (lit. this (chicken) ‒ big (chicken).’233
All nouns that can be used as repeaters in Murui, e.g. naɨzo ‘path’ can be easily referred back
to with the generic classifier -e. For instance, at some point Walter Agga, a fluent speaker of
Murui, was taking me to demonstrate how to paddle ‘properly’. He pointed at a canoe
(nokae) and a motor boat that were anchored to the shore line of a river bank, and said:
jaaitɨ-kaɨPRED
afai=beneLOC
(4.111) bai-e-doINS
that.CTS-CLF:G-INS go.FUT.LK-1pl upriver=HERE.LOC:NSP
‘By this, we will go upstream.’
I asked nɨ-e-do? (Q2-CLF:G-INS) ‘by which?’, hoping it would be a motor boat. Walter looked
at me smiling and specified what he meant: bi-kae-do (this.CTS-CLF.REP:CANOE-INS) ‘by this
(canoe)’. This is very similar to typical individualizing functions of classifiers.
In some cases, ‘headless’ nominal modifiers with repeaters are understood from the
non-linguistic context and cultural knowledge of the speech participants. For instance, at
some point I saw my consultant Tadave arriving home. I asked her how she came back,
suspecting that she came by canoe. She answered:
(4.112) bai-zo-do!
that.FSH-CLF.REP:PATH-INS
‘By that (path)!’
There is only one path between Tercera India and San Rafael, and it is common knowledge
among the people.
Similarly to classifiers, repeaters can also be used anaphorically. This is illustrated in
(4.113), which refers to a conversation with the topic of audio recorders. An elder wanted to
see all the audio recorders:
(4.113) naga-dora-naNP:O
EACH-CLF.REP:RECORDER.Sp-N.S/A.TOP
‘Bring all (lit. each of the) (recorders)!’atɨ!PRED
bring234
4.6SummaryMurui has a large multiple classifiers system, similarly to other neighboring languages
spoken in the vicinity of the Vaupés linguistic area. 169 The classifiers are suffixes that can be
defined as sets of morphemes used in various morphosyntactic contexts: on adjectives,
number words, pronouns, demonstratives, and interrogative content words, quantifiers, as
well as on nouns (free and bound) and verbs. In terms of their morphological structure, Murui
classifiers can be mono and disyllabic. In many cases, the meanings of disyllabic classifiers
are not compositional. While semantics of monosyllabic forms appear to be more ‘general’ in
nature, meanings of the disyllabic forms are more specific. According to their function,
semantics and the morphosyntactic contexts that they occur in, classifiers can be divided into
the following types: physical property classifiers (denoting, among others, shape, size,
interioricity, consistency, and function), animate classifiers (distinguishing natural gender),
abstract classifiers (designating abstract concepts), the neutral classifier -ra, and repeaters
(these are nouns with with non-human referents). The assignment of classifiers is generally
based on the meaning of a noun referent and their properties. Three major functions of Murui
classifiers are: derivation of nominal stems, formation of ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, and
functioning as nominalizers in relative constructions. The important discourse function of
Murui classifiers is reference-tracking.","[257, 258, 259]"

B. BENEFACTIVE ‘FOR, FOR BENEFIT OF’ WITH PRONOUNS – in their benefactive meaning, -ri
implies that the referent of the noun receives the benefit of the situation expressed by the
clause. The causal and benefactive meanings are related - benefactive readings do also
involve causal relationship. This is illustrated in (6.158). Such examples are rare in Murui,
however - while some speakers do use -ri with pronouns, others do not. Murui speakers
assign such usage to the Mɨnɨka variety, and frequently give benefactive reading in clauses
that contain with fakai ‘time’, as in (6.159).

clause might have two different interpretations, each depending on a situation. If a speaker
utters it when the referent is present (e.g. during a gathering), it has positive connotations and
is understood as ‘(He) speaks for (the benefit of) us.’. If the referent is not present, the
meaning is negative, as in (6.160):
(6.160) kaɨ-ri
ñaɨ-t-ePRED
1pl-BENEF.CAUS speak-LK-3
‘(He) speaks for (benefit of) us.’ or ‘(He) speaks (to cause misfortune) for us.’6.2.2.5 Privative
Murui nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers can take the case marker -(ni)no meaning
‘without’. The marker -(ni)no is in fact a combination of the negative attributive -ni followed
by the privative -no. Such privative clauses always share the same subject. Examples are
given in (6.161-163):

The marker can also occur on verbs and adjectives in the form of -(ni)no or -(ñe)no (cf. the
form of the standard negator is -ñe). 209 The privative -no has to co-occur with either the
negative attributive -ni, as in examples (6.161-163) above, or the standard negator -ñe, as in
(6.164) (see also §10.2.3-4).

‘I came without having worked.’6.3Order of argumentsGrammatical relations in Murui are shown by the order of core arguments in relation to the
predicate: SV and AOV. Murui shows a nominative-accusative pattern of constituent
ordering – S, A followed by O, occur before the verb. The placement of the non-core
arguments follows the nominative–accusative nature of Murui: SXV and AOXV. Oblique
arguments are obligatorily marked with cases (see §6.2.2.1 on the occasional omission of the
locative). (6.165) illustrates an intransitive clause with the oblique argument San Rafaelmo
‘to San Rafael’ following the S argument. (6.166) is an example of a transitive clause with
the O following the A.

(6.164) (see §10.2.3).","[334, 335, 336, 337]"
"A. INSTRUMENTAL WITH INSTRUMENTAL READINGS -do – Murui instrumental has a number of
meanings: ‘by means of’ and ‘by, through, on’. Instrumental marking occurs on nouns and
‘headless’ nominal modifiers, but not on personal pronouns. Instrumental ‘by means of’
encodes a meaning where a noun is either an instrument, material, or means by, or with
which the subject achieves or accomplishes an action, as in (6.136-138).

EACHñeeFILLERB. INSTRUMENTAL WITH COMITATIVE READINGS ‒ the case marker -do can have both
instrumental as well as comitative readings ‘with help of, assistance of, together with’
marking a referent that is assisting in an action to be completed or carried out. They can occur
on nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, and pronouns. An example of -do occurring on a
noun with an inanimate referent in (6.143), on a noun with animate referents in (6.144-145),
an interrogative content word in (6.146), and a pronoun in (6.145). Its usage on pronouns,
however, is sparse even among older speakers of Murui.","[331, 332]"
"292
were painting their bodies. Some children were playing around, and painted each other more
than it was necessary. (6.76) (with the unmarked O NP) was understood as if Jose painted
only a part of the body of Maria. This was not the case in (6.77) where the body of Maria was
fully painted:
(6.76) JoseA MariaO jide-d-ePRED
Jose Maria
paint-LK-3
‘Jose painted Maria (a part of body).’
(6.77) JoseA Maria-naO
jide-d-ePRED
Jose Maria-N.S/A.TOP paint-LK-3
‘Jose painted Maria (whole body).’
Again, taken out of context, these examples have somewhat different interpretations. The
unmarked (6.76), is understood that Jose painted Maria just once, while in (6.77) Jose paints
Maria’s body every single time she wants him to.
D. EMPATHY – in a number of instances, where the O NP is topical and specific in discourse,
the explicit marking of the O NP has overtones of some type of empathy for the referent.
Compare the following examples (6.78) and (6.79). In (6.78) the referent is not topical; it is
any girl I delivered, there is no relationship between me and the girl. In (6.79), it is a child
delivered by a medicine man. According to Sandriela Agga, it is not just a child. The child is
important; it is part of the medicine man’s family. The expression has some kind of
endearment reading to it.

E. POSITION OF THE NP ON THE NOMINAL HIERARCHY – case marking of an O NP does not
seem to play any significant role in differential subject marking (but see the marking of O NP
with the dative/lovative -mo in §6.2.1.6). Pronouns with both animate and inanimate referents
can be both marked and unmarked. An example of a marked pronoun is shown in (6.80). For
an example of an unmarked pronoun oo (2sg) ‘you’ see T2.26 in the Appendix.

‘So one time one man said to River: ‘We will play in San Rafael, will you go?’ he
said to him (to River).’
There is some indication however that -na does occur somewhat more frequently with
pronouns and animate nouns, than with animate nouns.
F. THE PREDICATE’S SEMANTIC GROUP – objects of verbs of perception, as well as verbs of
liking and knowing, obligatorily occur with the -na marker, as in (6.81-82), as well as (6.71)
above.

‘“They won’t tell me!” (she said). (She) didn’t want to listen to this.’294
G. CONTRASTIVE FOCUS – the O NP arguments take the N.S/A.TOP marking if they are in some
kind of a contrastive focus. Example (6.83) is a mother’s recommendation to her daughter not
to buy rice but sugar in the village. 199

‘You won’t bring the rice. You will bring the SUGAR.’
G. DISAMBIGUATION BETWEEN NPS – with respect to the O NP marking in Murui, in some
contexts, the topical non-S/A subject marker -na is used to disambiguate between two
arguments. See examples (6.84-85) below. If the O NP was left unmarked, rɨño ɨni could be
ambiguous as a possessive construction (‘woman’s husband’) with the A argument not stated.
(6.84) [rɨ-ño

‘The woman’s husband likes (it) very much.’

‘The woman likes the husband very much.’gaaɨ-d-ePRED
like-LK-3H. CONSTITUENT ORDER – when the O NP does not occur in the typical AOV constituent
order and the O argument is post-posed to the AV (AVO), it almost always receives the
topical non-S/A subject marking. This is illustrated in (6.86) where akie rafue ‘that story’ is
post-posed to the verb and therefore is topical (and in focus). (6.87) shows that the marker
-na does not solely depend on the constituent order, as in both positions (pre-V and post-V)
the O NP takes the topical non-S/A subject marker -na.","[316, 317, 318, 319]"

First and foremost, I would like to thank the Murui people of the Ereiaɨ clan of the Tercera
India community (Amazonas, Colombia) with whom I lived for over a year between 2013
and 2016, and who forged the deepest of ties with me over the years. My work on Murui
would never have been possible without Lucinda Rodríguez, kue ei, my Murui mother. She
taught me my first Murui words and has been patiently listening to me speaking Murui

I owe my deepest gratitude to my academic supervisors, Alexandra Aikhenvald and R.M.W.
Dixon, for their patience and constant support as well as their personal guidance that made
the completion of this thesis possible. Alexandra Aikhenvald has given me a vivid interest in
the Amazonian Linguistics. Her outstanding knowledge of the topic of the South American
languages (and beyond) has motivated and guided my work from the very beginning towards
the very end. At the heart of this thesis lies the monumental work of R.M.W. Dixon, Basic
Linguistic Theory. R.M.W. Dixon, a scholar of unparalleled knowledge of the world’s
languages, and a most generous mentor over the years.
I am grateful to all the members of the The Language and Culture Research Centre at James
Cook University: Elena Mihas, Mikko Salminen, Luca Ciucci, Lourens de Vries, Willem

Australia, but also elsewhere in the world in ways I had never expected. And to everybody
who has been part of my life in different ways. At times, we may be long distances apart but
eventually our paths always cross.
Thank you all, Kasiaxi

Chapter they are in (e.g. example ‘(1.5)’ refers to Chapter 1, example 5). Examples have
three lines. The first line is orthographic and breaks up each word into morphemes. The
second line shows morpheme-level glosses. SMALL CAPS are used for grammatical glosses.
Proper names are reproduced throughout the glossing. The final line provides a free
translation into English. The free translations are as idiomatic as possible; parentheses
complement contextual meaning of the free translations. If an example is to be found in the
text in the Appendix, it is marked with ‘TextNumber.SentenceNumber’, as in (T3.3).
In the text, verbs are given in a citation form, where the predicate marker (-dɨ/-tɨ) is
followed by the 3rd person pronominal subject marker -e. For instance, the verb ‘write’ is
presented as kue(te) ‘write’, where kue- is a verbal root. Punctuation depend on the pauses in
speaker’s speech after the sentence is considered to have been completed. Clauses and
sentences are not capitalized. When one word has several different meanings, the most
appropriate one is given in the gloss. ‘Headless’ nominal modifiers that are used as heads of
intransitive predicates are often shown in brackets to indicate non-verbal forms used
intransitively, e.g. [mare-ko]-d-e (good.ATT-CLF.REP.DOG-LK-3) ‘it’s a good (dog)’.
The quotation marks placed around the term Witoto are done at the request of the
Murui, Mɨnɨka, Mɨka, and Nɨpode people. ‘Witoto’ subsumed these four separate groups. The
term Witotoan refers to the language family (that consists of ‘Witoto’, Ocaina, and Nonuya).
Throughout the chapters, there are a few numbering gaps, as some examples were
eliminated in the final stage of the revision process.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

1st and 2nd person pronouns marked with the genitive -ɨe can occur as arguments of predicate
and take case marking, the topical non-S/A subject marker -na, the locative -mo, and the
instrumental -do markers, as in (5.30-32). For 3rd person pronouns, as shown in (5.33), the
case marker occurs on the connective ie, as in (5.34), not on the pronoun itself. 174

Under specific pragmatic conditions, the ordering of VCS - VCC can be reversed. This has to
do with putting extra emphasis on the constituent in that position. 175 Compare (5.21-22)

In Murui only kue-ri (1sg-BENEF.CAUS) ‘for me’ is appears to be possible in such constructions (see §6.2.2.4).
175It is similar to the emphasis in the highly marked VCC-VCS constituent order (§6.3).","[268, 269]"
"3.1Open word classesOpen word classes are nouns, verbs, and adjectives. All three word classes are distinctly
different in their derivational possibilities and functional slots available. Nouns occur
primarily as heads of NPs, and can also function as heads of intransitive predicates. They take
a distinctive nominal morphology that includes case and plural marking. The class of Murui
nouns is discussed in §3.1.1. Verbs take verbal morphology and function as heads of
predicates of all types. They are subject to valency-reducing (passive, see §8.1) and
increasing processes (causative and double causative, §8.2). Murui verbs are the topic of
§3.1.2. In terms of their morphosyntactic properties, adjectives form a separate class in
Murui. They share grammatical categories with both verbs (i.e. they can function as heads of
intransitive predicates, but occur with a limited number of verbal markers) and nouns (they
can take nominal morphology and function as modifiers within an NP). Murui adjectives are
discussed in §3.1.3. Section §3.1.4 discusses word class-changing morphological derivations
that involve open word classes. Table 3.4 in §3.4 summarizes the properties of open, semiclosed, and closed word classes.",[141]

A few affixes have the same meaning with both verbs and adjectives. This is the case for the
manner suffix -rui illustrated in (9.18) (cf. the manner -rui with verbal roots, Scheme 7.1 in
§7.1 and the manner -rui with adjectival roots, Scheme 3.3 in §3.1.3).

B2. FORMATION OF ADVERBS – most of the adverbs have adjectival origin. Such adverbs
consist just of an adjectival root and the positive attributive -re, and obligatorily occur in the
pre-verbal position, as in (9.19). Such formations are not possible for the majority of Murui
verbs.

B3. INABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THE MAJORITY OF VERBAL CONSTRUCTIONS – an important
distinction between verbs and adjectives in Murui is the occurrence of verbs in imperative,
passive, and causative constructions. This also includes the standard negative marker -ñe and
clause linking markers that are not available for adjectives. Verbs can be negated by both the
standard negative marker -ñe and by the negative attributive -ni (for ‘lack of ability’). Verblike adjectives can only be negated by suffixing the negative attributive marker -ni to the root.
That is, bora-re-d-e (yellow-ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) yellow’ becomes bora-ni-d-e (yellow-NEG.ATTLK-3) ‘(it’s not) yellow’ (but see §10.2.1.2 for differences between younger and older Muruispeakers). Adjectives are do not occur with the majority of clause linking markers such as the
future event nominalizer -ye (followed by the topical non-S/A subject marker -na) that
normally occur on verbs in purposive clauses (see §12.3.1).
B4. THE STRUCTURE OF ‘HEADLESS’ NOMINAL MODIFIERS WITH ADJECTIVES IS THE SAME AS
THAT OF OTHER ‘HEADLESS’ NOMINAL MODIFIERS – ‘headless’ nominal modifiers which makeup a complete NP in Murui, are formed from other word classes (nouns and noun roots,
adjectives, pronouns, as well as number, demonstrative, and interrogative roots) by means of
classifiers (see §4.2.1), e.g. jano-kae (small-CLF.REP:CANOE) ‘little (canoe)’. They take
nominal morphology that includes plural/collective and case marking. In such structures,
classifiers are directly suffixed to nominal roots. Verbal and adjectival roots require a linker
position to be able to take on a classifier, e.g. maka-dɨ-mɨe (walk-LK-CLF:PR.M) ‘(male) who
walks’.
B5. THE OCCURRENCE WITH THE INTENSIFIER eo ‘very’ ‒ the intensifier eo ‘very’ occurs as a
pre-modifier with adjectives and those ‘headless’ nominal modifiers that contain an adjective411
(see §3.3.1 on Murui intensifiers). An example of eo occurring in the adverbial position with
the ‘headless’ nominal modifier is given in (9.20):
(9.20) [bi-e
jɨko]VCS eo
jea-koVCC
this.CTS-CLF:G dog
very ugly-CLF.REP:DOG
‘this dog is very ugly (lit. this dog – very ugly (dog)).’
The intensifier eo can also occur in the adverbial position modifying verbs; it can neither
modify nouns nor ‘headless’ nominal modifiers with adjectival roots (see §3.3.1).
B6. DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES – derived adjectives cannot take the generic
classifier -e (unlike nouns, noun roots, pronouns, as well as number, demonstrative, and
interrogative roots). If they refer to a human referent, they are obligatorily suffixed with the
‘pronominal’ animate classifiers, e.g. uze-ñaiño (white-CLF:PR.F) ‘white woman’. This is
similar to nouns, noun roots, pronouns, and number, demonstrative, and interrogative roots,
but unlike verbal roots which typically occur with ‘derivational’ animate classifiers, e.g.
dobe-ño (crush-CLF:DR.F) ‘basin (for crushing unprocessed yucca)’.","[433, 434, 435, 436]"

focus. Example (6.37) presents a talk between two people about who came from Leticia.

6.2.1.3 O core arguments
The O argument in Murui is defined as the non-S/A core argument. Semantically, in
transitive clauses, A arguments can potentially initiate or control the activity. As Dixon
(2010b: 76) put it: “And if there is something which is saliently affected by the activity, the
argument referring to this will be in the O function.” O arguments in Murui are recognized
based on the following morphological and syntactic criteria:
1) The O argument is expressed only ‘outside’ the predicate (unlike the S/A arguments that
are cross-referenced on the predicate and oblique arguments), as in (6.38):

word-N.S/A.TOP282
2) O arguments are marked with the topical non-S/A subject marker -na that marks a variety
of core non-subject participants (prototypical patients and recipients), as in (6.39-41): 194

subject -na and cannot be marked with any other case markers. O arguments can also be left
unmarked (see §6.2.1.4 for factors conditioning the differential object marking). An example
of a marked O argument is presented in (6.42) and a zero-marked O argument is in (6.43):

All types of nominal constituents can take the topical non-S/A subject marker -na (nouns,
nominalizations, pronouns, and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers of all types). The sentence in194The same form of the accusative case marker -na also occurs in Aguaruna (Jivaroan/Chicham) spoken inPeru. In Aguaruna -na marks both O and E arguments, unlike in Murui (Overall, 2008: 215). In Hup (Makú)
spoken in the Vaupés it has the form -an (Epps, 2005). There is also a multifunctional -na marker in Tariana
which marks objects and recipients on pronouns (Aikhenvald, 2003).","[305, 306, 307]"

4) Murui has the default SXV and AOXV constituent orders where the S/A arguments are preposed to the clause-final predicate (see §6.3 for details). If the core arguments are unmarked
for any of the core cases, the constituent order is the one that indicates the syntactic role of
the participants. In the transitive clause, the placement of the O argument is restricted in that
the O NP cannot precede the A argument but may follow the verb. When that is the case, it is
marked with the topical non-S/A subject marker. In (6.49) the O NP follows the verb and,
therefore, takes -na.

The topical non-S/A subject marker -na marks core O NPs (that are not in the addressee/
recipient function, see §6.2.1.6). An NP can take no more than a single case marker at a time
(but see the ablative marking in §6.2.2.2). The pattering of topical non-S/A subject case
marking conforms to certain grammatical and semantic restrictions conditioned by the
semantic and pragmatic status of the nominal (see the following section §6.2.1.5). The285
marker -na is a phonologically and morphologically bound form. It is also a multifunctional
marker which can mark other non-subject arguments that are frequently topical (and,
therefore, it is called the ‘topical non-S/A subject marker’). These are:
1) Time words are frequently marked with -na (see also §3.2.2), such as naɨo-na ‘night (cf.
naɨo ‘night)’, as in (6.51). Other nouns that are obligatorily marked with -na include, e.g.
mona ‘day’.

1pl
zai-ta-d-ePRED
step-CAUS-LK-3
‘It was very quick, they almost stepped on us at night.’
2) Adverbs can take the marker -na, as in aiyuena ‘a lot’, ebena ‘brusque’, atona ‘straight’
(see also §3.2.1). This is illustrated with marena ‘well’ in (6.52):
(6.52) kue=mei mare-na
1sg=so
good.ATT-N.S/A.TOP
‘I grew up well.’komui-dɨ-kuePRED
grow-LK-1sg3) The morpheme -na is one of the forms of the event nominalizer, as in (6.53) (see also
§3.1.4):
(6.53) ee~e-na (cry~RED-E.NMLZ) ‘crying (and crying)’
jaai-ñe-na (go-NEG-E.NMLZ) ‘not going’
jea -re-na (dirty-ATT-E.NMLZ) ‘being dirty’
4) It is the source for ablative -mona on nouns (see §6.2.2.2), e.g. Colombia-mona ‘from
Colombia’; on adverbial demonstratives the form of the ablative marking is -na (see §3.3.3),
e.g. bene-na (HERE.LOC:NSP-ABL) ‘from here’.
5) the topical non-S/A subject marker can be used as a topical clause linker. For instance,
constructions with the sequential dependent marker -no can be followed by the topical non-286
S/A subject -na. In (6.54), the sequential clause guajanona ‘after toasting’ and ɨmuiyanona
‘after mixing with salts’ marked with N.S/A.TOP -na are highly topical and therefore are
marked with -na (Wojtylak, forthcoming-a).

person already chew.coca-LK-3
‘And so, after pounding, after adding salts, one (person) already chews it (the coca).’
6) The topical non-S/A subject marker functions as a topical marker of clauses with
purposive meaning, as in (6.55) below. Murui purposive clauses are in fact future event
nominalizations that occur in the O function usually followed with -na. This is illustrated in
(6.55).

upstream=AT.LOC:NSP go.FUT.LK-1sg beer.Sp 1sg drink-FUT.E.NMLZ-N.S/A.TOP
‘I will go upstream to drink beer (lit. my future drinking beer).’
The nominalizer -ye can be the sole marker of purposive construction as well (see §12.3.1).
7) Many types of dependent clause markers are obligatorily marked with -na (see §12.3.1).
The case in point is muidona‘for reason, because of’, as in (6.56) below. 195

complement clauses (see (6.46) above).","[308, 309, 310, 311]"
"The overt marking of the core cases is conditioned by both discourse and alignment of
constituent order in the clause. Murui non-core arguments are optional and can be included in
either clause type. These oblique arguments are: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactivecausal, and privative. Marking of the non-core cases is usually mandatory (see §6.2.2.1 on the
omission of the locative).
Each NP takes a single case marker at a time. This is the case for any kind of case
marker (core or non-core). Murui case markers are always suffixed to the final element (the
head) of an NP (see §3.1 on the noun structure and §4.1 on the structure of Murui NP).",[297]
"219
b) a form of repeater is the same as that of the classifier. This is the case for -ro
(CLF:STRING) and -ro as a possible source of a repeater of rero ‘watch’ (phonologically
adapted from the Spanish word reloj). In such cases, disyllabic forms are preferred. In
case of rero, it is da-rero (one-CLF.REP:WATCH.Sp) ‘one (watch)’.
c) under specific circumstances forms of certain repeaters are ambiguous. This is the
case for instance for the repeater -dora from Spanish which can refer to either
komputadora ‘computer’ or grabadora ‘recorder’. To disambiguate, in a situation where
both objects are present, a full noun is used instead.
There are a few Spanish nouns that cannot occur as repeaters. These include, among others,
words such as musica for ‘music’.
Similarly to classifiers, within an NP, repeaters do not occur on modifiers when a
head noun is present (as there is no agreement within an NP in Murui, see §4.1). In (4.74), the
noun is modified with the numeral da- ‘one’, followed by the allomorph of the generic
classifier -e. There is no agreement with the head noun jano-tava ‘small chicken’.

jano-tava-na]NP:O
atɨ-d-ePRED
one-CLF:G small-CLF.REP:CHICKEN-N.S/A.TOP bring-LK-3
‘(She) brought one small (chicken).’
Similarly to classifiers, rɨño ‘woman’ and ɨɨima ‘man’ can occur with repeaters to mark
natural gender distinctions. Cf. also (4.39).
(4.75) rɨ-ño-tava (woman-CLF:DR.F-CLF.REP:CHICKEN) ‘female (chicken)’
(4.76) ɨɨi-tava (man-CLF.REP:CHICKEN) ‘male (chicken)’
These structures are similar to full NPs. Compare examples (4.75-76) with (4.77-78) below.
The nouns rɨño ‘woman’ and ɨɨima ‘man’ have the same semantic function but formally are
NPs where the head nouns are modified by atava ‘chicken’. Cf. also (4.35-38).","[243, 244]"
"300
various semantic and syntactic functions (see also §6.2.1.6 on differential case marking with
the dative/locative -mo, and a clause linking device, see §12.3.1). Murui oblique case markers
never co-occur with the core-case markers (with the ablative being the only exception, see
§6.2.2.2 for details). The only case marker that can be omitted under specific pragmatic
conditions is the locative (see (6.110-6.111) in §6.2.1.1).","[324, 325]"

She also carried the load of instructing and introducing her daughter to her duties and
obligations as a woman. Father’s dominance played a crucial role in male children’s
upbringing. He was responsible for their mental, emotional, and physical education. In case
of a father’s death, the responsibility for female and male children was transferred to the izo
‘father’s brother’. The maternal family was not expected to take part in the upbringing of the
child but they could have a casual relationship with the young ones. The mother’s brothers
and sisters were not considered to play any significant role in a child’s life, as they were
members of a different consanguineous group (E. Minor & Minor, 1980: 81).
The terminology of the ‘Witoto’ kinship system, ranges over five genealogical levels.
Relatives above generation G2+ and beneath G2- are not differentiated, and become, therefore,
non-traceable. 34 In the second ascending generation, there is an instance of terminological
merging with regard to female blood relatives of Ego. In the generation of Ego, the terms for
sister and brother extend to cover children of one’s parent’s siblings and their denomination
depends on the sex of Ego. For the male Ego, in the first ascending generation, the system
makes a distinction between cross and parallel cousins. While the parallel cousins are
considered to be blood related to Ego (and are, therefore, referred to by the same kin terms),
cross cousins are not. The Witotoan languages share only a handful of kinship terms; even
basic terms greatly differ from language to language (e.g. ‘mother-in-law’ in ‘Witoto’ is
jɨfaiño, in Nonuya it is (possessor)-jóvano, in Ocaina xoraahya; in the terms for ‘mother’ in34According to the classical anthropological classification, the ‘Witoto’ kinship system might be classified as avariation of the Omaha type (Wojtylak, 2012b). E. Minor and Minor (1980) analyses the system as Hawaiian.
To my understanding of the kinship terminology, the Hawaiian system does not differentiate between mother
and father’s sides of the family in relation to Ego, and it is ambilineal (Nanda & Warms, 2007: 192-198). The
‘Witoto’ kinship system clearly differentiates between father’s and mother’s side, but uses no bifurcate merging.
The mother’s patrilineage is insignificant to Ego.","[58, 59]"

"7.1Predicate structureRoot and affixes appear frequently in the order shown in Scheme 7.1 below (see also §3.1.2).
The underived verbal root (slot 1) can be either mono or disyllabic, such as ro(te) ‘sing’,
ja(te) ‘smoke’, ruui(de) ‘roast’, kuei(de) ‘finish’, koro(de) ‘drink broth’, and chicho(de) ‘suck
(bone, finger)’. Reduplicated roots (slot 2) express high degree of intensity of an activity (see
§7.2.2.3), such as maka~maka-dɨ-kue (walk~RED-LK-1sg) ‘I am walking (and walking)’.
Some verbs have lexicalized trisyllabic roots, which contain ‘thematic syllables’ (slot 3).
These thematic syllables appear to be fossilized affixes, now integrated into roots, and cannot
be omitted (see §7.2.2.6). These include eight instances of suffixes which have forms of
classifiers, as in raɨna(de) ‘sit down, put down (on a surface of any kind)’, cf. raaɨ(de) ‘sit

can occur on all types of lexicalized verbal roots.
The ordering of affixes that follow the verbal root is fixed, but not all the suffixes can
occur on every verb. For instance, intransitive verbs do not receive the passive marking; body
movement affixes do not occur on verbs which do not denote change of bodily position. In a
minimally inflected verb in Murui the positions 1, 15, and 16 are obligatorily filled, as in
(7.1). (7.2) shows a ‘complex’ verbal structure inflected with a variety of affixes; such
‘complex’ structures are not common.

one slot within the verb structure (slots 2, 5, and 10). Aspect markers from those slots can cooccur (but there often there is just one choice per slot). Some aspectual distinctions are
restricted to certain tenses. For instance, reduplication, which marks intensity and repetition,
cannot be expressed in future tense; neither does the general habitual -kabi occur with future
tense marking. Other aspectual markers tend to co-occur, such as durative and inceptive
markers; others are restricted and cannot occur with other categories (for instance, remote
habitual is mutually exclusive with the customary marker). Tense (slot 14) is preceded by
negation, indicating that position available for tense is further away from the root than other
verbal categories, such as negation (slot 12). Slot 15 is most commonly filled by either the
linker -dɨ/-tɨ, or the passive -ka/-ga. An example of a passivized verb is given in (7.3).","[342, 343, 344]"
"3.2.1AdverbsMurui adverbs constitute a semi-closed word class. They are modifiers to verbs and
predicates (never used as predicate heads); the majority cannot take case marking (but some
can be marked for the topical non-S/A marker -na). The majority of Murui adverbs are of
adjectival origin (where deadjectival forms function like adverbs; these constitute an open
word-class); other types form closed word classes. Another distinguishing property of
adverbs is that they answer the question nɨeze? ‘how’, rather than bue? ‘what’ or nɨe?
‘which’ (see §3.3.4). Murui distinguishes between adverbs of manner and place. The
properties of the Murui adverbs are summarized below:

A. ADVERBS OF MANNER – on morphological grounds, adverbs of manner can be divided into
a number of classes:
A1. OPEN CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN MARKED WITH -re – most of
these manner adverbs are of adjectival origin (and as such can be used as heads of intransitive
predicates). They belong to an open class and cannot take case marking. This is illustrated in
(3.32), where the adjective jea- ‘dirty’, followed by the positive attributive -re, modifiers the
verb eruaɨ(de) ‘look’:
(3.32) bi-kos
jea-re

‘This (dog) looks dirty.’eruaɨ-d-ePRED
look-LK-3A2. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN (OPEN WORD CLASS) MARKED
WITH -re – a small group of adjectives, which have the positive attributive -re as a part of theroot (rather than a separate suffix, see §3.1.3), obligatorily take the topical non-S/A marker
-na in adverbial position. This is illustrated in (3.33), with the adjective mare ‘good’
modifying a verb.
(3.33) [kue jɨko]S mare-na
1sg dog
good.ATT-N.S/A.TOP
‘My dog seems well (lit. good).’joruaɨ-d-ePRED
seem-LK-3A3. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN (CLOSED WORD CLASS),
UNMARKED – there is a small group of adjectival roots which can function as adverbs andquantifiers (see §3.1.3). These are komo ‘new (recent)’ and aiyo ‘big (a lot)’. Similarly to
other adjectives, they take classifiers to form ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, e.g. aiyo-ko (bigCLF.REP:DOG) ‘big (dog)’. Underived, they function as adverbs and quantifiers. This is140
illustared in (3.34-35) (see also §3.3.1 on the quantifier aiyo ‘a lot’). They can be further
modifier with the intensifier eo ‘very’.
(3.34) eo aiyo i-t-ePRED
very a.lot exist-LK-3
‘There is a lot (of it!)’
(3.35) komo
rii-d-ePRED
recently arrive-LK-3
‘(He) has just arrived.’
Interestingly, when they take the generic classifier -e obligatorily followed by the topical
non-S/A subject marker -na, they can also occur in the adverbial position, as in (3.36).
Although there is no apparent difference between the aiyo and aiyuena, and the two
structures co-exist, among the Murui elders the underived form aiyo is used more frequently.
(3.36) eo aiyue-na
i-t-ePRED
very big.CLF:G-N.S/A.TOP exist-LK-3
‘There is a lot (of it!)’
A4. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF VERBAL ORIGIN MARKED WITH -re – a small group
of adverbs of manner which have verbal origin. When marked with -re, they cannot take case
marking. An example of jarire ‘quickly’ (from the verb jari(de) ‘vapor’), is given (3.37).

‘My grandmother, after becoming angry, used to walk quickly (lit. like vapor) inside
the house.’
A handful of lexicalized manner adverbs of verbal origin show some archaic derivational
processes which are synchronically not productive in the language. Such adverbs do not take141
-re, but the unproductive suffix -kɨ and the topical non-S/A marker -na. 108 Compare jarire
‘quickly’ in (3.37) with jarikɨna in (3.38). There appears to be no difference in meaning
between jarire and jarikɨna.

A5. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS WITH UNKNOWN ROOTS MARKED WITH -re – a small
class of lexicalized adverbs; their roots are no longer transparent and can be either adjectival
or verbal in origin (but not adverbial). They retain the positive attributive -re, e.g. raɨre ‘fast’,
and cannot take case marking. In (3.39), raɨre is modified with the intensifier eo ‘very’.
(3.39) [bi-e

‘This child wakes up very fast.’
A6. CLOSED CLASS OF ADVERBS CONTAINING -ze – two manner adverbs that contain the
similative suffix -ze; these are: raize ‘well, correctly’, as in (3.40), and feekuize ‘slowly’.
They cannot take case marking.
(3.40) raize
yo-itɨ-o!PRED
well.SIMIL tell-FUT.LK-2sg
‘Tell (it) well! (lit. You will tell (it) well!)’
The suffix -ze is productive with nouns, and it has the equative-like meanings that refer to
size (see §9.2.6). Nominal modifiers with -ze have similative-like meanings, as in nɨ-e-ze (Q2CLF:G-SIMIL) ‘how?’ in (3.41) and bi-e-ze (this.CTS-CLF:G-SIMIL) ‘like this’ in (3.42). Such108The unproductive -kɨ might have been a classifier at some earlier stage. It is homophonous with the classifier-kɨ for ‘round’, ‘cluster’, and ‘inherent’ (§4.2.2.1). The topical non-S/A marker -na is multifunctional and is
used on various types of arguments (§6.2.1).","[163, 164, 165, 166]"
"3.3.2PronounsIndependent pronouns (for animate referents) distinguish three numbers (singular, dual, and
plural), and three persons (1st, 2nd, and 3rd). In addition, Murui differentiates between
masculine and feminine gender for the 3rd person singular, and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person dual.
There is no exclusive vs. inclusive distinction, unlike in other neighboring languages, such as
the neighboring Bora (Boran). In pronouns, the masculine gender is the functionally
unmarked form in the dual (cf. §3.1.1 showing masculine animate classifiers as the
functionally unmarked gender). There are no gender distinctions in plural number. The 3rd
person pronouns are bound forms (originally, ‘pronominal’ animate classifiers) that are
formed with demonstratives (§3.3.3). Murui pronouns are presented in Table 3.1:155

-mɨe
-ñaiño
-aɨmaiaɨ
-aɨñuaɨ
-makɨThe 2nd person singular oo can be followed by a special ‘attention’ suffix -re. 123 The most
common bases for 3rd person pronouns are the anaphoric demonstratives i- and nai- (§3.3.3),
e.g. nai-mɨe (ANA.SP-CLF:PR.M) ‘he (specific)’, i-mɨe (ANA.NSP-CLF:PR.M) ‘he (unspecific)’.
Other types of demonstratives can also be used as 3rd person pronouns, e.g. bi-aɨmaiaɨ
(this.CTS-CLF:PR.M.PL) ‘they (two males) (lit. those, close to speaker, two males)’.
Ethymologically, the 3rd person dual masculine and feminine are cases of double marking (cf.
the plural marker -aɨ, see §5.2). 124 Interestingly, the 3rd person dual masculine and feminine
forms can occur with the number word da- ‘one (lit. alone)’ (cf. §3.2.3). With the first
syllable being monophthongized, the forms are daɨmaiaɨ ‘(only) they two (males or a male
and a female) and daɨñuaɨ ‘(only) they two (females)’. In the everyday speech, the 3rd person
singular feminine form -ñaiño can also be used as free forms ñaiño and naiño. 125 The
phonological reduction can occur also with the 3rd person masculine dual. In rapid speech123Oo-re (2sg-ATTENTION) frequently precedes the noun moo ‘father’. Oore (moo) has honorific readings (seeexamples T4.2, T4.11, and T4.15 in the Appendix).
124Occasionally speakers omit the first instance of the plural marker -aɨ. In such cases, the 3rd person dualmasculine and feminine have forms -maiaɨ and -ñuaɨ.
125Ñaiño and naiño are glossed as CLF:PR.F. Note that the ‘derivational’ animate classifiers -ño and -ma canoccur as free forms ñoo and mɨɨ (CLF:DR.F and CLF:DR.M) as endearment forms for the family members of the
same sex as ego. Interestingly, the form mɨɨ undergoes vowel centralization here, a process which is very
common elsewhere in the language, e.g. distance calls and in songs (see §2.5.1).","[179, 180]"
"10.1 Negation ‒ general characteristics
Negation in Murui involves the morphological process of affixation, where a negative marker
is added to a corresponding positive in main and subordinate clauses. Negation of predicates
is expressed in two different ways: with the standard negative marker -ñe (slot 10 on the verb
structure, see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1) and with the negative attributive -ni ‘lack of attribution
(ability, property, possession)’ (slot 11, cf. the mutually exclusive positive attributive -re for
having ‘attribution (ability, property, possession’). The Murui negative markers with their
corresponding positive equivalents are illustrated in Table 10.1.
Table 10.1 Murui positive and negative markers
Positive Negative
–
-ñe
General
-re
-ni
Attributive
Compare the positive and negative constructions in (10.1a-b). The structure of ɨɨ(de) ‘swim’
does not differ from the ‘affirmative’ in (10.1a) with the exception of the addition of the
standard negative marker -ñe in (10.1b):430
(10.1) a. ɨɨ-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-LK-1sg
‘I swim’
b. ɨɨ-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-NEG-LK-1sg
‘I don’t swim’
Examples (10.2a-b) illustrate the positive and the negative constructions with the attributive
markers -re (‘positive attributive’) and -ni (‘negative attributive’) that follow the verbal root
ɨɨ- ‘swim’. Depending on the marker, they mean roughly ‘to have the ability to swim’ and
‘not to have the ability to swim’:
(10.2) a. ɨɨ-re-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-ATT-LK-1sg
‘I can swim (e.g. I am feeling healthy enough to swim)’
b. ɨɨ-ni-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-NEG.ATT-LK-1sg
‘I can’t swim (e.g. because I am sick)’
Depending on the word class they occur with, the attributive markers have different
semantics. They involve ‘ability’, as in (10.2a-b) above, but can also refer to ‘property’ and
‘possession’. The semantics of Murui attributive markers is outlined in Table 10.2.

VERBS
[+ ability]

ADJECTIVES
[+ property]

NOUNS
[+ possession]
[– possession]Generally, the positive attributive -re, as in moko-re-d-e (green-ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) green’,
cannot be negated with either of the negative markers. The positive attributive -re occurs in
the same structural slot as the negative attributive -ni (see §3.1.3). Nowadays, younger
speakers of Murui occasionally negate the positive attributive -re with the standard negative
marker -ñe, yielding constructions such as moko-re-ñe-d-e (green-ATT-NEG-LK-3) ‘(it’s) not431
green’. Older speakers accept only negative constructions with the negative attributive -ni, as
in moko-ni-d-e (green-NEG.ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) not green’. The standard negative and the
attributive markers are used in slightly different environments. While the attributive markers
occur on verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the standard negative -ñe occurs on verbs and nouns
only (with adjectives, the negative attributive is used instead of the standard negative marker
-ñe). The occurrence of Murui attributive and standard negative markers with verbs,
adjectives, and nouns is given in Table 10.3 below.

‘Neither Katarina nor Maria came (lit. Kata with Maria never came).’
A constituent of a negated clause may bear additional stress. Additionally, the topical S/A
and non-S/A subject markers are present on a constituent that is in constrative focus. To
express meanings such as ‘it wasn’t the man we met, it was the spirit’ speakers say ‘we didn’t
meet THE MAN; we met THE SPIRIT’, as in (10.4) below (cf. jɨko=dɨ (dog=S/A.TOP) ‘dog’
in example (6.10) in §6.2.1.1):

(10.5) is an example of the nominalized clausal constituent ‘one who doesn’t talk’. Cases of
double negation within a sentence, such as in (10.5), are not too frequent.

know-NEG-LK-1sgIn Murui, questions differ from declarative and imperative clauses in both their intonation as
well as structure (see §11.2). The structure of some type of questions is unusual in that
predicate markers can be omitted for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural. Negative questions
with omitted predicate markers have different readings than their positive counterparts (see
§10.2.2). Murui has a single negative imperative (prohibitive) form, the standard negative
marker -ñe followed by the marker -no (see §10.2.3). Many of grammatical categories
available in positive clauses are available in the negative as well but there is some minor
degree of paradigmatic asymmetry between positive and negative imperatives. For instance,
the grammatical category of rapid action (used for immediate imperative meanings) cannot be
expressed in negative imperative. The language has two ‘privative’ markers -nino on nouns,
and -nino and -ñeno on verbs and adjectives (on verbs, -ñeno has prohibitive meanings, see
§10.2.3).
Murui lacks an independent grammatical word ‘no’; negative answers are expressed
by jɨɨ ‘yes, no’ followed by negated predicates instead (§10.3.1). 272 Murui has a number of
question words which can function as indefinites, such as ‘nobody/somebody’ and
‘nothing/something’. Their positive and negative readings depend on the predicate’s polarity
(see also jaka in (10.3) that can mean ‘always’ or ‘never’). The language doesn’t seem to
have inherently negative words. A few positive words however, such as mare ‘good,272Jɨɨ ‘agrees’ with predicate’s polarity and, depending on the context, can be translated as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’.","[454, 455, 456, 457]"
"252
When modifying intransitive predicates with ‘headless’ nominal modifiers as heads,
pronominal subject marker has to be coreferential with the modifying pronouns, as in (5.68).
Constructions where these are not coreferential, such as those in (5.69a-b), are
ungrammatical.

(lexical) verb i(te) ‘exist’ where the R is marked with the locative case, as illustrated in (5.7273) below: 178178This is called ‘locational schema’ in Heine (1997).","[276, 277]"
"31
and riddles (Echeverri, 1997: 79). 29 Each ‘Witoto’ clan had its own totem that identified their
apical ancestor with animals, plants, cultural objects, or natural phenomena (Gasché, 2009c:
12). To an extent, this practise is still true today. For instance, nowadays, during important
traditional festivals and celebrations, roofs of malocas may occasionally be painted with
totemic symbols that represent certain clans.
Male dominance (especially the father and father’s brother) played a crucial role in a
child’s upbringing. In the case of a father’s death, the responsibility for a child (both
emotional and physical) was transferred to izo, the father’s brother (but never mother’s
brother) (E. Minor & Minor, 1980: 75). Nevertheless, the mother was always an important
person in the life of a child, as she was compelled to care for the infant. The maternal family
was not expected to take part in the upbringing of the child but they could have a casual
relationship with the young ones. The mother’s brothers and sisters were not considered to
play any significant role in a child’s life, as they were members of a different consanguineous
group. Among the ‘Witoto’ people, the birth order determined a child’s status in the family.
For instance, when a man died, his possessions were transferred to his first son. If he had no
son, they would be given to his aama ‘brother’, followed by mirɨño ‘sister’, komoma ‘son of
his sister’ and a enaize ‘nephew’ (in that order) (E. Minor & Minor, 1980: 81-82) (see also
§1.3.4 on kinship terminology).
Traditionally, the division of labour between the ‘Witoto’ women and men was clearcut and, in some respects, it was also a matter of taboo. Following Whiffen (1915: 67), in
addition to being ‘the wife, the mother, the cook, and the housekeeper’, the woman was29As of 1909, Pinell (1928: 228-229) reported the existence of at least 136 ‘Witoto’ clans. Almost a centurylater the number has decreased to 76 (Echeverri, 1997: 77). For Murui there are officially 32 clans in existence
(OIMA, 2008: 29-31).","[55, 56]"

In verbless clauses expressing possession and benefaction, VCC’s are possessive phrases

NP’s that function as arguments (nouns and nominalized verbs and adjectives) take the
negative attributive marker -ni, always followed by privative case marker -no. An NP marked
this way has then the privative meaning ‘without’, as illustrated in (10.86-88) (see also
§6.2.2.5 on the privative case marker).","[475, 476]"
"271
This is illustrated in (6.4-5). The difference between these two examples is related to how
topical the referent is in the context. In (6.4) nokae ‘canoe’ is unmarked implying that the
canoe is not topical and has a ‘generic’ referent. In (6.5) ‘canoe’ is specific (a speaker has a
specific referent in mind) and is therefore marked with topical non-S/A subject marker -na. 189
The marking of the core cases (S/A and O) is discussed in §6.2.

canoe-N.S/A.TOP make-LK-2sg
‘Did you make the canoe?’ (implying that you know how to make canoes)In addition to the typical SV/AOV constituent order (see §6.3), the overt core-case marking is
one of the main grammatical mechanism to distinguish core arguments within a clause (see
also Chapter 8 on valency-changing mechanisms). When no overt morphological marking of
grammatical relations is present, in order to avoid any potential misunderstanding, the order
of the NPs helps to determine syntactic functions of core arguments. It is thus apparent that
there are two mechanisms for distinguishing syntactic functions of the core arguments in
Murui: the morphological mechanism (i.e. overt case marking on S/A and O arguments) and
the syntactic mechanism (i.e. constituent order).","[295, 296]"
"313
In Murui, there is a certain flexibility in the constituents patterns where the oblique argument
(marked as X) occurs either before the verb (XSV and XAOV) and after the V (i.e. SVX and
AOVX). In (6.167) the oblique jofomo ‘home’ is placed after the verb:
jai

‘Did (he) go already?’
A:jɨɨ

jaai-d-ePRED jo-fo-moLOC
yes already go-LK-3
house-CLF:CAV-LOC
‘Did (he) go home already?’Oblique arguments in transitive clauses usually follow the O (i.e. AOXV), but can also be
fronted, or postposed to the verb. Occasionally, the A argument in a transitive clause can also
follow the verb yielding the OVA constituent order. This has a kind of afterthought effect;
there is a short pause between V and A. This is illustrated in (6.168-169). In (6.168) the A
argument, Flor, is postposed to the verb roko(de) ‘cook’. This is similar in (6.169). VOA and
VAO constituent orders never occur in the natural discourse.

The postposition of the A argument is similar to the occasional VCS constituent order in

nɨ-rui
rii?PRED

In passive constructions (see §8.1) the constituent ordering is of great importance. Different
orders can yield different interpretations. Compare (6.171-172):
(6.171) jɨkoOBLIQUE ainɨ-kaPRED
dog
bite-PASS
‘(somebody, e.g. a boy) was bitten by a dog’
(6.172) (janayari)OBLIQUE ainɨ-kaPRED jɨkoS
jaguar
bite-PASS
dog
‘the dog was bitten (by a jaguar)’
Often, there is some kind of morphological marking of grammatical relations in the clause
(§6.2). To avoid any potential misunderstanding when core arguments are zero-marked, the
order of the NPs can help to determine syntactic functions of core arguments. These syntactic
functions are shown by the nominative–accusative ordering of arguments in relation to the
predicate: SV (SXV) and AOV (AOXV) (the oblique ‘X’ arguments have to be marked).
There is a certain flexibility in the constituent patterns where the oblique argument may
occasionally precede the S/A argument (XSV and XAOV), or occur following the verb (SVX
and AOVX). This suggests that X arguments have a certain degree of mobility within a
clause. Occasionally, the O argument can occur in the clause-final position, i.e. AVO. Even
though it is not common, the O argument can precede the A argument in transitive clauses
(OAV). In such instances, the accusative marking on O NP is often retained, regardless of the
referent’s discourse status. There is also a prosodic emphasis (pitch) on the A argument
(which might explain why in those cases the nominative marking is not necessarily retained).
In dependent clauses the constituent order appears to be rigid, verb-final (see §12.3). The
order of constituents in those clauses with increased valency is AO1VO2, in those with
decreased valency is SOOBLIQUEV (see also Chapter 8).","[337, 338, 339]"

the andative with the locative, as in (6.113), and the ventive with the ablative case, as in

Elsewhere in the grammar, Murui locative case extends to cover the domain of time on verbal
predicates where it occurs as a clause linker marking temporal relations (see §12.3.1). It
indicates that an action happened simultaneously while another action was taking place. This
is illustrated in (6.115):
(6.115) gaɨri-dɨ-kaɨ-mo
jɨaɨ-kɨnoS
rii-yaPRED
gather-LK-1pl-TEMP
other-CLF:NEWS arrive-E.NMLZ
‘While we were gathered (at night in a communal house), another message came.’
The locative -mo is also used in lexicalized expressions used for counting in Murui (see
§3.2.3). In comparative constructions, various forms of the STANDARD MARKER of
comparison take obligatorily the locative case marker as well (see Wojtylak (forthcoming-b)
and §9.2 on comparative constructions), as in kue baaɨ-fe-mo (1sg THERE-CLF:SIDE-LOC)
meaning ‘than me’ but best translated as ‘me on the over there side, ahead of me’.
Murui has a number of grammaticalized lexical items that are marked with the303
locative case, and seem to have retained their apparent nominal origin. In the following
example, jerei means ‘inside’ and it is marked with the locative -mo in (6.116): 205

‘And inside of this (maloca) that’s how we lived.’(6.116) [ieCONNCuriously, a few derived nouns can take the marked -na to indicate location, instead of -mo.
The difference in meaning is very subtle. The -na marking refers to an unspecific, undefined
location in space, rather than a specific, defined location.

Murui has a class of inherently locational expressions that do not take the locative marking.
That class consists of some place adverbs (such as ana ‘below’, aa ‘above’, foo ‘inside’, jino
‘outside’, fuirɨ ‘downstream’, afai ‘upstream’) and demonstrative and interrogative content205The original meaning of jerei is ‘guts, stomach’, e.g. kue jerei izi-re-na (1sg guts painful-ATT-E.NMLZ) ‘myguts hurts (lit. are painful)’.","[326, 327, 328]"

referents are always marked with -mo. The meaning of marked arguments with the
dative/locative is ‘focused O addressee/recipient’. The marking on the O NP:Addressee is
typically used in imperative clauses where clause marked with -mo has an abrupt, brusque
reading of ‘give ME (it)’, as in (6.89). Unmarked O NP:Addressee do not have such readings,
as in (6.90).

Nouns in the addressee function always receive the -mo marking. Examples (6.95-96)
illustrate an extended transitive clause with three arguments. In (6.95) these are: kue (1sg) ‘I’

Some verbs obligatorily take the locative marker. For instance, a type of a predicative
construction employs the intransitive verb i(te) ‘exist’ where the possessor (R) is marked with
the locative case; cf. ‘locational schema’ in Heine (1997). An example is given in (6.98) (see
also §5.1.3.2 on the use of i(te) in expressing possession).

Marking of some O NP arguments can also be related to argument structure, marking -na is
not possible. Verbs of seeing have different argument structure than verbs of looking: verbs
of seeing are marked with -na (cf. (6.81) above), and verbs of looking with the locative
-mo, as in (6.99).

-aɨmaiaɨ is sometimes pronounced as -aɨmɨe (see example (7.33) in §7.2.2.2). 126
Independent pronouns and verbal cross-referencing suffixes share the same forms for
all persons. Unless animacy, gender, and number are important in the context, the 3rd person
is always cross-referenced with the pronominal subject marker -e (cf. Table 7.1 in §7.1). This
3rd person cross-referencing suffix, used for low animate and inanimate referents, has the
form of the generic classifier -e. This indicates that the person system is based on the
opposition 1st and 2nd person (which are pronouns) vs. 3rd person (which are in fact noun-like
forms which contain classifiers as derivational devices). That the 3rd person forms are
different morphologically from the first and the 2nd person pronouns is shown by their
morphosyntactic behaviour:
A. The 1st and 2nd person, which are SAP, and 3rd person (non-SAP) do not form one
paradigm. The 1st and the 2nd person pronouns can be suffixed with the 3rd person bound
forms (that is, the 3rd person pronoun forms behave in the same manner as other classifiers),
but not the other way around. For instance, the 1st person plural kaɨ can take the 3rd person
plural -makɨ, as in kaɨ-makɨ (1pl-CLF:PR.GR.AN) ‘us (our people, group)’. Kaɨmakɨ can also be
expressed by a noun phrase kaɨ-zie i-makɨ (1pl-CLF:CLAN ANA.NSP-CLF:PR.GR.AN) ‘member of
our clan (lit. group of our clan)’.
B. Unlike the 3rd person pronouns, the 1st and the 2nd person pronouns can take the genitive
marker -ɨe (see §5.1.1.2).","[180, 181]"

ño-bɨnɨ-kaɨ (woman-CLF:DR.F-CLF:SHORT.THICK-CLF:STICK) for the number ‘five’. Counting
from ‘six’ to ‘ten’ is done with the thumb of the right hand, and continued up to the little
finger which has the value of ‘ten’. To count from ‘eleven’ to ‘twenty’, one uses toes called
eɨ-kaɨ (foot-CLF:STICK) (toes do not have separate names, unlike fingers). The ‘toe counting’
begins with the little toe of the left foot and proceeds to the little toe of the right foot.
The language employs several ‘counting systems’ or ‘numeral strategies’ for
counting. Number words of each system have mixed word class membership. In terms of
their morphological composition, we can identify three distinctive ‘counting’ strategies:
A. BASIC NUMBER WORDS ‘ONE’ AND ‘TWO’ – the forms da- ‘one’ and mena ‘two’ are the
simplest underived and unanalyzable words expressing numeral meanings. Nowadays, their
primary function is to indicate an exact quantity, but da- can also mean ‘alone’ and mena
‘unit, set of two things, pair’. Synchronically, these forms do not seem to belong to the same
word class. At least in Murui, there is evidence for da- and mena having somewhat different
status. The form da- ‘one’ commonly occurs as a bound form followed by a ‘default’ generic
classifier, as in (3.46); mena ‘two’ is an independent free form, illustrated in (3.47):
(3.46) [da-je
ono-kaɨ]NP
one-CLF:G hand-CLF:STICK
‘one finger’
(3.47) [mena rɨ-ño]NP
two
woman-CLF:DR.F
‘two women’
Both forms da- ‘one’ and mena ‘two’ can take classifiers, and are used ‘headlessly’, without
the accompanying noun, as in (3.48-49):

kue-moO:ADDRESSEE ine!PRED
two-CLF:STICK 1sg-LOC

‘Give me two (stick-like forms, here: cigarettes)!’
The number word da- ‘one’ also derives a manner adverb with the locational suffix -ne, as in
da-ne ‘again, one more time’ in (3.50):

ooO:ADDRESSEE i-tɨ-kuePRED
2sg
give-LK-1sg ONCE request-LK-2sg
‘I’ve given (it) to you earlier, (and now) you are asking (me) again…’(3.50) jaePASTB. FRATERNAL NUMBER WORDS ‘THREE’ AND ‘FOUR’ – the second numeral strategy involves a
minimal system that works in ‘pairings’, and consists of two numbers: ‘three’ and ‘four’.
These numeral terms are analyzable periphrastic ‘fraternal’ expressions that are
etymologically transparent and convey an idea of ‘having a brother’ (based on the
classificatory kinship term aama ‘brother for ego masculine’, see §1.3.4). Both fraternal
number words are highly lexicalized in Murui. This system is subtractive rather than additive.
The Murui term for ‘three’ is da-(je) aama-ni, where aama ‘brother’ is suffixed by the
privative -ni ‘without’, the NP is further modified by the bound form da- ‘one’ and a
classifier (usually the general -e). Daje aamani can be translated as ‘one brother-less’ or ‘one
without brother’. In (3.51-52), the number word daje aamani ‘three’ modifies a noun within
an NP:

quantifier suffix -ga (classifier-like morpheme meaning ‘all’, ‘each’, or ‘every’, see §3.3.1);148
aama ‘brother’ is modified by naga. The term ‘four’ roughly translates as ‘all brothers (lit. all
of each brothers)’. 118 An example of the number word naga amaga ‘four’ modifying a noun
within an NP is given in (3.53):

onwards Murui employs yet another system of numeral expressions. It is a limited quinary
(base-five) system for numbers ranging from ‘five’ through ‘twenty’. These numeral forms
are complex expressions that contain classifiers as derivational markers, and are based on the118Fraternal number words are typologically unusual. For ‘Witoto’ Nɨpode, Torres (1988) attempts to interpret‘Witoto’ fraternal number words. He relates them to the structure of ‘Witoto’ maloca and its division into four
fundamental load-bearing studs (see example 1.10 in T1 in the Appendix).","[170, 171, 172, 173]"
"3.3.6AdpositionsMurui has a small class of adpositions (postpositions). They cannot be modified. We can
distinguish the following types of postpositions:
A. POSTPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE FORMATIVE dɨ- ‒ there are the postpositions free forms
dɨga ‘with, together with’ (cf. nɨga ‘how much’ in §3.3.4, and naga ‘each, every’ in §3.3.1)
and dɨne (cf. the unproductive suffix with locative semantics -ne in §3.3.3), which often occur
as enclitics. An example of post-head dɨne was given in (3.91), and (3.96). Dɨne can also
occur as a free form meaning ‘there’; it functions similarly to lexical adverbial
demonstratives (§3.3.3). As such, it can be followed by case markers, as in (3.124):

constructions, it can occur as a pre-head position as a modifier to a noun meaning ‘many’, as
(3.125), which is a casual exchange between two elders during a gathering in a maloca:

"259The terminology used throughout this paper follows Dixon (2012: 343-375). In Dixon’s terminology, theprototypical comparative construction scheme in the English example ‘John is more handsome than Felix’
consists of: ‘the COMPAREE (that which is being compared) – ‘John’, the STANDARD of comparison (what the
comparee is being compared against) – ‘Felix’, the PARAMETER of comparison (the property of comparison) –
‘handsome’, the PARAMETER MARKER (called hereafter P-MARK) of comparison – ‘more’ (or -er as in ‘tall-er’),
and the STANDARD MARKER (S-MARK) of grammatical function of the STANDARD – ‘than’. In terms of Dixon’s
(2012) classification of prototypical comparative constructions, Murui comparatives are of the A and B types .",[437]

5.1.1.3 Pronouns and classifiers
An alternative way of expressing possession is with classifier constructions. Murui has a
multiple classifier system where classifier and repeaters (partially repeated nouns for which
no classifier exist) occur in numerous morphosyntactic contexts (see §4.2). In Murui, if a
possessed noun is to be focused on (and it is retrievable from the context), the head noun is
omitted, and the pronoun (for the 1st and 2nd person) takes a classifier or a repeater. In such
constructions, pronouns function as R while classifiers have the D function. Such structures
are similar to those illustrated in (5.24-27). ‘Derivational’ animate classifiers never occur in
such positions (see §4.2.2.2). Examples of physical property classifiers and repeaters are
given in (5.39-41) below.
(5.39) koko-rui
1du.m-CLF:DAY
‘our (day)’ (two men referring to their birthday)
(5.40) kaɨ-ko
1pl-CLF.REP:DOG
‘our (dog)’ (cf. jɨko ‘dog’)
(5.41) omoɨ-dora
2pl-CLF.REP:RECORDER.Sp
‘your (recorder)’ (cf. grabadora (Sp.) ‘recorder’)
Pronouns that take the genitive -ɨe cannot take other classifiers. Classifier stacking structures
with -ɨe, such as *koko-ɨe-rui (1du.m-GEN-CLF:DAY) intended for ‘my day’, are
ungrammatical. An NP can contain a pronoun marked with the genitive -ɨe only if it is
followed by a head noun. Such constructions have emphatic readings (see also §4.4 for the
possible origin of the classifier stacking structures). This is illustrated in (5.42):
(5.42) [koko-ɨe
i-rui]NP
1du.m-GEN ANA.NSP-CLF:DAY
‘MY day (lit. mine - any (day))’247
In Murui, constructions that allow classifier stacking are limited. For instance, animate
referents are never used in the classifier slot. Apposition within an NP is the only way to
express the possessive relation between ‘Walter’ and ‘hill’ in (5.43).
(5.43) [WalterR i-duD]NP
Walter ANA.NSP-CLF:HILL
‘Walter’s hill’5.1.2Relationship and meaning of possessive noun phrasesIn Murui the apposition within an NP ‘covers’ all types of possessive relationships including
ownership, whole-part relationships, kinship and attributive relations, orientation,
associations as well as nominalizations. These are discussed in turn.
A. OWNERSHIP – the referent can have either permanent or temporary ownership. The
following example (5.44) is taken from a conversation about a boat motor of Jose’s. Jose is
the only person in the community who owns a motor.
(5.44) [JoseR motoD]NP:S rɨi-re
jaai-d-ePRED erua?
Jose moto
angry-ATT run-LK-3
see.really
‘The motor of Jose runs fast (lit. angrily), doesn’t it?’
It is not customary to refer to temporary possession in Murui. Customarily, it is always the
rightful owner who is mentioned, never the temporary one. For instance, when Walter was
using a canoe that his cousin Gaɨe lent him for a long period of time, that canoe would always
be referred to as Gaɨe nokae ‘Gaɨe’s canoe’, never as ‘Walter’s canoe’. Only if an object is
officially given to somebody and becomes their possession, will it be referred to by using the
‘new’ owner’s name. Under certain circumstances, when possession is unclear (e.g. theft), the
object can be referred to with the name of the ‘new’ owner to avoid confrontation, e.g.
Tadave celular ‘Tadave’s phone’ (when knowing that the phone isn’t hers), but more
frequently a demonstrative is used instead of the owner’s name, e.g. bie celular ‘this phone’
(accompanied by a gesture).","[270, 271, 272]"

A. SEMANTIC CRITERIA – from the point of view of semantics, Murui adjectives:
A1. STATE A PROPERTY (OR ITS LACK) – Murui adjectives state a property of a noun referent
(or its lack) when they function as heads of intransitive predicates or form ‘headless’ nominal
modifiers. In addition, the attribution of property can be either ‘timeless’ or ‘temporal’ (see
§3.1.3 and §9.2).
A2. SPECIFY A REFERENT OF A NOUN – adjectives help to identify a referent of the head noun
in an NP, as illustrated in (9.6) where the adjective root jano- ‘small’ specifies the noun
kɨrɨgaɨ ‘basket’ within an NP. This is similar in (9.7):
(9.6) [bi-e
kɨrɨ-gaɨ

this.CTS-CLF:G basket-CLF:BASKET small-CLF:BASKET bring-LK-1sg

jaka-ko]S
eo jano-re-d-ePRED

house-CLF:CAV old-CLF:COVER very small-ATT-LK-3
‘My house which is old is very small.’
A3. SERVE AS THE PARAMETER IN COMPARATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS – although both nouns and
verbs can occur as the Parameter of comparison, there is a strong tendency for adjectives to
occur in this function (§9.2).
B. GRAMMATICAL CRITERIA – based on their grammatical properties, adjectives share features
with nouns and with intransitive verbs. Since both verb-like adjectives and verbs can fill the
intransitive predicate slot, criteria for distinguishing adjectives from verbs and nouns are:
B1. Different possibilities within the predicate slot,
B2. Formation of adverbs possible for adjectives but not verbs,
B3. Inability to function in the majority of verbal constructions,
B4. The structure of ‘headless’ nominal modifiers with adjectives is the same as that of407
other ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, but not that with verbs,
B5. The occurrence with the intensifier eo ‘very’ with adjectives but not with nouns,
B6. Different morphological possibilities for ‘headless’ nominal modifiers and nouns.
B1. DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES WITHIN THE PREDICATE SLOT – verb-like adjectives can occur
only with a limited number of verbal suffixes (see Scheme 3.3 in §3.1.3). Unlike verbs,
adjectives obligatorily occur with the attributive -re and -ni, and the markers meaning
‘become’, e.g. moko-re-d-e (green-ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) green’, zuu-nai-t-e (sad-BECOME1-LK-3)
‘become sad’.
The semantics of the attributive markers -re and -ni with adjectives is different from
those of verbs. They involve ‘ability’ with verbs (‘can’ and ‘cannot’) but ‘property’ with
adjectives (‘having the property’ and ‘not having the property’, see §10.1). This is illustrated
with the abilitative readings on the verb kue(te) ‘write’ in (9.8) (the O NP argument is not
stated). This is unlike the example with an adjective in (9.9); the meaning of the adjective
kaɨmare(de) ‘tasty’ has no abilitative overtones.

Unlike verbs, (verb-like) adjectives can be marked with the suffix -oi to denote ‘half, a little
bit’. There is a homophonous durative -oi on verbs but it occurs in a different structural
position (see Scheme 3.2 in §3.1.3) and has different semantics. On adjectives -oi follows the
positive attributive -re, e.g. kaɨma-re-oi-d-e (happy-ATT-HALF-LK-3) ‘half-happy’, naime-re-408
oi-d-e (sweet-ATT-HALF-LK-3) ‘half-sweet’. There is no marker for verbs that would mean
‘half, a little bit’ (see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1). An example is given in (9.10):
(9.10) [kaɨ jo-fo]S
jea-re-oi-d-e-mo
1pl house-CLF:CAV dirty-ATT-HALF-LK-3-TEMP
bi-t-ePRED
come-LK-3
‘When our house was half-dirty, they arrived.’nai-makɨS
ANA.SP-CLF:PR.GR.ANVerb-like adjectives differ also from verbs in the form of nominalizers. In addition to the
attributive markers, adjectives are nominalized with -na, as illustrated in (9.11). Nominalizers
on verbs have the forms -a, -ja, and -ya (-na on verbs occurs only when it follows the
standard negative -ñe, see §3.1.4 on nominalizations):

izi-re-na]]
okui-d-ePRED

tooth-CLF:POINTED

‘Kata endures the pain of the tooth.’
Adjectives have also a number of specific inchoative markers of sorts (-nai, -tai, and -dai)
which do not occur on verbs (see Scheme 3.3 in §3.1.3). All of them refer to ‘becoming’ (in
terms of having characteristics of a feature denoted by the semantics of the root) that often
translates into English as ‘getting’. 258 Examples are given below:
