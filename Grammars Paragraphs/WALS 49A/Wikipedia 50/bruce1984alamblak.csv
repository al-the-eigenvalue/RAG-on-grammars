1.1.2General fea tures of the A l amb l ak l anguageAlamblak is an agglutinating polysynthetic language with some fusional
elements. It is predominately suffixing with some prefixing on verbs and no
infixes .
The basic word order of the clause is SOV, with some flexibility in
ordering . Most general morpho - syntactic tendencies which are typically
associated with SOV languages (cf . Greenberg 19 6 3 ) are exhibited in Alamblak .
Specifically , case relators follow the noun as enclitics , subject and object
NP ' s are unmarked for case , and an interrogative element is not fronted in the
clause , but it is ordered in the same way that the grammatical relation it is
questioning would be in a declarative sentence (cf. section 3 . 4 ) , and subordinate
clauses usually precede the independent clause ( cf . section 3 . 6 ) .
There are certain departures in Alamblak from some of the generalisations
made by Greenberg for SOV languages . For example , while the ordering of a
nominal object before the verb is not strict , the purpose clause is not required
to follow the main verb (cf . Greenberg 1 9 63 :84 ) but it occurs as frequently
before the main verb as after it (cf . section 3 . 7 ) . Secondly, while subjects
and objects (both nominal and pronominal) agree with the verb in person, number ,
and ( in third-person singular forms) gender (cf . section 3 . 3 ) , the adjective
does not agree with the head noun for any category (cf . section 3.3 ) contrary
to Greenberg ' s ( 1963 : 9 3 ) prediction .
In the noun phrase (cf. section 3 . 2 ) descriptive adjectives may precede or
follow the head noun, with the prehead position being the most common . Possess­
ive phrases and relative clauses normally precede the head noun . Only the final
element of the noun phrase hosts inflectional - like categories , so that there is
no agreement system operating within the noun phrase .
The Alamblak verb ( cf . section 3 . 3 ) i s potentially a highly complicated
polysynthetic unit manifesting various patterns of serialised verb, noun,
adjective , and time word roots .
The clause is dominated by its semantic role structure although referential
structure does play a minor role in the organisation of the clause . These
notions are discussed both later on in this section and in sections 3 . 4 and 3 . 5 .
1.2Goa l sThe goals of the present study are twofold . The primary goal is to present
a description of a grammar of Alamblak . 5 The secondary goal is to present the
grammar in a way which will make it a useful and lasting reference for investi­
gators of language and languages .","[7, 8]"
"3.7.3.2Gen i t i ve case mark i ngThe genitive case marking on clausal participants i s another means of
encoding the role structure . The general pattern has been discussed in section
3 . 7 . 1 . In general , the noun phrase which is least access ible to verbal cross­
referencing in independent clauses ( according to the actor and undergoer
selectional hierarchies , cf . section 3 . 5 . 2 . 1 ) is the most l ikely to take the
genitive form in dependent clauses . The occurrences of genitive noun phrases
are summari sed for the purpose relative clause , nominal clause and purpose
clause in Tables 41 and 49 ( in section 3 . 2 ) , and in Table 128 , respectively .
The selection of the genitive NP constituent i s not a strict syntactic rule
based on a hierarchy of grammatical relations , since variation can occur .
Usually , however , the genitive will occur on the non-actor if there i s more
than one nuclear NP in the clause . The factors ( e . g . referential factors)
which impinge on the general pattern have not been identified at this stage .
See example of the purpose relative clause , nominal clause and purpose clause
for illustrations of genitive NP ' s in dependent clauses .",[297]

3.5Seman t i c s of i dependent c l auses3.5.0I ntroduct i onThe basic structures of the clause and its constituents have been described
in section 3 . 4 . The ways in which this basic equipment of the clause is used
to talk about the real world are determined largely by semantic considerations .
In this section we look at the clause from a semantic viewpoint , considering
first the structure of the clause as a whole and then its elements and the ways
in which they interrelate . Section 3 . 5 . 2 deals with the interrelationship of
syntax and semantics . That section investigates aspects of the encoding of
semantic roles , the structural reflexes of the semantic features of transitivity ,
and the notions of referentiality and perspective .
3.5.1Rol e stru ctureIn general terms , the semantic structure of the clause we are concerned
with here can be described as structured relations which allow the speaker to
identify the role each participant is playing (partiCipant roles) , the relation­
ships of staging elements in the setting to the predicate and/or participants
(orientation roles) , and the means and/or manner whereby the predication is
carried out (modal roles) . The elements of the clause , then , include the
predicate and its arguments which have participant , orientation , or modal roles
in the predication .
The discussion is organised as follows : each set of semantic roles is
explicated and defined , followed by a discussion of the overt case markers and
case marking systems which encode them. The surface case markers are defined
semantically and rules are postulated whereby each overt marking may be inter­
preted as a specific role .
It is suggested here that a ' surface ' case-marking system can and should
be semantically characterised . Such a concrete general specification will not
fully explicate the precise semantic roles of NP ' s in most clauses . A more
finely- analysed system of covert role relationships is necessary to complete
the picture . Fillmore ( 1968) emphasised the inadequacy of assigning single
comprehensive meanings to surface case markers since, for one thing, such
meanings could not represent satisfactory semantic primitives . It is contended
in this section , however , that both the overt case-marking system and the
covert system of specific roles have semantic functions and an attempt has been
made to describe them both .
3.5.1 .1Ori entati on ro l esOrientation roles provide the spatial and temporal orientation of the
proposition . They are summarised as follows with approximating English glosses :

discussed in section 3 . 4 . 2 . We have therefore only summarised them here and
now proceed to discuss interpretation rules associated with the case markers
that encode them.
3.5.1 .1 .1Adess i ve N PAs indicated by its label , this case marker may be characterised by the
adessive role which it primarily encodes . It exhibits conditioned meaning
variants as follows :
Adessive NP : Adessi ve role with non-motion verbs
All a ti ve role with motion verbs
The adessive NP is interpreted as having an allative role when co-occurring
with motion verbs and an adessive role when co-occurring with non -motion verbs ,

"Comr ie ( 19 7 9 ) has suggested that definite and animate direct obj ects form
a natural class . After presenting evidence from a variety of languages
to support his claim, he offers an explanation for i t . His explanation
is e ssentially that case marking serves as an overt marking of the differ­
ence between subj ects and objects rather than a marking for identifying
subj ects and obj ects independently . His argument seems particularly
convincing for those languages which mark subj ects and most direct obj ects
in the same way but distinctively mark definite and/or animate direct
obj ects . Comrie ' s conclusion is that subj ects are typically animate and
definite and those direct obj ects which are animate and/or definite wi l l
b e the mos t l ikely t o b e confused with subj ects and therefore receive
specific marking to distinguish them from subj ects . Inanimate direct
obj ects , on the other hand , which are marked like subj ects ( e . g . with
the nominative form or no case marking at all ) , will be interpreted by
a strategy which assigns the actor role to the animate NP and undergoer
role to the inanimate NP . The case here is s imilar in that the animate
NP in example 3 2 6 is preferentially assigned to an actor role ( comitative )
and to other roles only where the context so constrains the selection .",[315]

1 .5Pres en ta t i onThis study of 1:he Alamblak language presents a phonological analysis in
Part Two and a reference grammar in Part Three . Samples of the Alamblak
language are presented in an orthography which is based on the phonological
analysis in Part Two.
As an aid to tile presentation, the abbreviations and other conventions
listed below have bE�en used. Abbreviations for semantic and syntactic functions
have initial capitals while those for morpho-syntactic categories are entirely
in upper case .",[18]
"These uses of the infinitive in independent c lauses employ the same form as in
its dependent complement use . Pragmatically , the work it does of focussing on a
tenseless event or state is accomplished well in both cases .
The purpose clau se , a subtype of the infinitive clause , also functions as
a complement in a matrix clause . I t is discussed along with adverbial clauses
in the next section .
Many cases of complementation in Engl ish are equivalent to dependent
clauses manifesting a function within the noun phrase in Alamblak . Thus the
nominal clause ( v . section 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 6 ) manifesting the nuclear function is used
in Alamblak for constructions such as , ' hi s going to school ' in ' I desire his
going to school . ' A relative clause (v . section 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 4 ) or a direct
quotation ( cf . the Quotation sentence in section 3 . 6 . 2 . 2 ) or a j uxtaposed but
intonationally integrated copulative c lause ( cf . section 3 . 3 . 2 . 1 ) may be
employed in A larnblak for ' that ' complements in English , e . g . ,285

"Faltz ( 1978 : 76 ) has identified three patterns of encoding the recipient
semantic case role in the world ' s languages . Alamblak is of the type he
refers to a s a "" D . O . type of indirect object marking"" . The terminology
is somewhat confusing here . By ' indirect obj ec t marking ' , Faltz is refer­
ring to the semanti c case role ( e . g . recipient or benefactive) which is
generally associated with an indirect obj ect . By this system the recipient
role is encoded by the same form which is identif ied as direct obj ect in
transitive clauses . In a ditransitive clause a patient NP ( e ncoded by
the D . O . in transitive c lauses) typically loses many of its D . O . proper­
ties .",[315]
"128Ful l first- and second-person forms of the paradigm manifest the base of
the copul ative cons truction . A reduced base form
i s used in the case of
third-person forms , however . Third-person pronouns are analysable into base +
terminator , whereas other pronouns are not analysable , at least in the context
of the copulative construction . The final consonant of third-person pronouns
has been reinterpreted to be a person-number-gender terminator by analogy with
nominals which are also third-person in form . First- and second-person pronouns
have not undergone any such reanalys is .(re)Whatever the exact reason for the disparate analysis by Alamblak speakers
of different pronoun forms , what is perhaps both more interes ting and more of
a synchronic problem is the fact that in some contexts third-person pronouns
are treated the s ame as first- and second-person pronouns .
At present it seems that third-person pronouns have five base forms which
occur in different grammatical environments .
' third person ' occurs in
copulative constructions ;
and
whose final consonant is the

can be described as hosting terminations in the same way nominal phrases do

occurring immediately fol lowing a pronoun base .rer , ret , ref,remReWe would l ike for our description to explain why this special rule , and
the special base forms of third-person pronouns , occur in the grammar . The
historical development of person-number-gender markers will be of signi ficance
relating to this question . We will not discuss the origin of person-number­
gender markers in Alamblak in this work , however .","[133, 134]"
"The structure of the clause is examined in sections 3 . 4 and 3 . 5 . Included
in the discussion of the syntax of the clause (section 3 . 4 ) is a description of
the three nuclear noun phrase types , viz . subject , inner object, and outer
object . (Nuclear NP ' s are either obligatory for a given clause type or are
potentially coreferenced by one of two verbal suffixes . ) The traditional term
'subject ' is retained but further analysed in those few cases where it does not5work (section 3 . 5 . 3. 3) . The terms 'direct object ' and ' indirect object ' , how­
ever , are dispensed with, and ' inner object ' and 'outer object ' are defined in
terms of Alamblak syntax with reference to Faltz ' s ( 19 7 8 : 7 6 ) discussion of
indirect objects in universal syntax ( cf . section 3 . 4 . 4 ) .
The lower level morpho-syntactic structures as described in sections 3 . 1In a
3. 3 can generally be described meaningfully in a context-free approach .
study of clause structure , however, there is a definite tension between a
context- free and a context-sensitive approach to the description . The context­
free approach , e .g . describing the structure of discourse-initial clauses , is
the simplest . Under those conditions , clause types can be distinguished in
terms of, among other things , their obligatory constituents . Initially clause
types are contrasted in this way in section 3 . 4 . A full complement of these
' obligatory ' noun phrases seldom occurs in a discourse context, however , due to
the anaphoric reference function of the verbal pronominal suffixes and other
interclausal rules . To account for the more typical clause structure , e .g .
discourse-medially , the formal descriptions o f clause types allow for a zero
(0) manifestation of NP ' s which are obligatory for discourse-initial references
to other than first- or second-person referents .
1 .4 .1 .4Seman t i c ro l e s t ructureThe semantics of the clause is discussed in section 3 . 5 . Semantically
clauses are discussed in terms of a predicate {manifested by a verb) and its
associated arguments (manifested by nominal constructions) . The arguments of
a predicate function with certain roles in the predication .
The oblique NP ' s (relator-related phrases) are syntactically marked for
fairly specific role relationships which they bear to the predicate . These
roles are categorised as Modal roles and Orientation roles . These categor­
isations are comparable to Fillmore ' s ( 196 8) Modality of the proposition or
Cook ' s ( 1 9 7 2 ) Modal cases or Grimes ' ( 19 7 5 : 119- 1 2 3) Orientation roles . There
is never exact agreement on what to include as roles and how to classify them.
Fillmore ( 19 6 8) includes instrument with his propositional roles ; Chafe ( 19 7 0 )
would relegate instrument to the modality of the clause; Cook ( 19 7 2) includes
instrument , cause , purpose , and accompaniment as modal cases ; Longacre ( 1 9 7 6 )
does not consider comitative to be a semantic role, but insists that instrument
is diagnostic of a class of verbs ( i . e .
neither modal nor orientational , but
nuclear) , and he relegates cause and purpose to the sentence level , the realm
of combinations of predications . A categorisation of roles into modal and
orientation roles is merely for convenience of discussion and is in no way
crucial to the description of the clause .
The roles of the nuclear NP ' s viz . actor, undergoer , and object , are
directly indicated by the clause structure . The limitation of three roles in
the clause structure and their terminology was inspired by A. Hale ( 1 9 74 ) .
These are termed participant roles because 'participant ' emphasises the crucial
involvement that the referents of these nuclear NP ' s have in the predicated
situation .
The clause structure assigns only a general role to NP ' s in the clause,
oblique NP 's being typically more precisely indicated than nuclear NP ' s . More
precise role relationships are a factor of the meanings of the specific nouns
and verbs in the clause . The more precise roles will be described for each6' case marking ' on oblique NP ' s and as part of the case frames of a representative
set of semantic classes of verbs in Alarnblak for the roles of the nuclear NP ' s .
The case-grarnrnar-type semantic case roles , then, will be discussed in section
3 . 5 , but only as part of the feature specification of lexical items and not as
part of an independent semantic structure of the clause itself .
1 .4 . 1 . 5Referent i a l s t ructure and the NP acces s i b i l i ty hi erarchyThe noun phrase accessibility hierarchy (AH) is first mentioned in section
where it is employed as a framework for describing types of relative clauses .
The AH as formulated by Keenan and Comrie ( 19 7 7 ) ranks noun phrases according
to their accessibilit:y to relati visation processes , as follows : Subject > Direct
Object > Indirect Ob:iect > Oblique > Genitive > Object of Comparison .
Referential structure is discussed in section 3 . 5 . 2 . 3 , in relation to the
notion of subject . It is concluded there that the notion of subject is a
conflation of the mOl:e prirni ti ve features of role , referentiali ty , and
perspective . 6 Subjects in Alarnblak are defined by several semantico-syntactic
features : the subject: is actor ( identified by the first pronominal suffix in
the verb) , is the left-most of the nuclear NP ' s , may be relativised on , and
controls interclausal switch reference . In example 1 , yawy t dog is the subject .

"9The function-set , or form-meaning composite in syntax has already been
alluded to . It is the name of this unit, the tagmeme , from which the theory
derives its name . The term tagmeme is not used in this grammar , although the
notion itself is . Essentially , a tagmeme is the specification of a possible
constituent of an abstracted construction type . At least two types of structures
are relevant to any grammatical constituent : ( 1 ) its paradigmatic relationship
with other members of a set of elements which may manifest a given function in
a construction and ( 2 ) its functional relationship , or relationships to other
constituents in the construction . Morphosyntactic constructions , then, are
analysed in terms of the grammatical functions of their constituents and the
potential manifesting set of elements (i . e . the exponents) of those functions .
A particular segment of speech will be a well-formed construction if it meets
the structural description of a construction type , i . e . having permissable
exponents manifesting described functions within the construction .
A construction type , then, is essentially a phrase-structure rule in
transformational generative grammar terminology , with the functions of the
constituents specified . Other information is provided in displays of construc­
tion types as well , such as optionality and the basic ordering of constituents .
Matters of permutability , repeatability , and cooccurrence restrictions relating
to constituents , as well as semantic interpretations in given contexts are
discussed informally as required .
An example of a construction type , the minimal kinship stem is given in
Table 1 by way of illustration .
Tabl e 1 : Mi n i ma l k i n s h i p stem
+Functions
exponentsNucleusKin term roots

WMt (substantive)y i ma t
tameh+Classifier-em ' kinship marker 'A kinship stem consists of two obligatory constituents , one functioning as
nucleus and the other as c lassifier . A particular stem may be constructed by
selecting an exponent for each function . Possible exponents of the nucleus
function are kin term roots (specified in the lexicon) , the root y i ma t friend
and the interrogative root tameh WMt (substantive) . One of these roots must
be combined with the suffix -em ' kinship marker' to form a minimal kinship stem .
The construction itself does not manifest a function until it is embedded as a
constituent of another construction . In the noun phrase base , for example ,
(cf. Table 36) it is listed as an exponent of the nucleus function .
While the functions of constituents within constructions are given a
prominent place in the tagmemic model , they have not often been explicitly
defined . For example, it is not at all clear that the nuclear functions of
constructions at different levels are distinct from each other or if the
difference between them lies in the functions of other constituents in the
constructions which relate differently to and have different effects on the
nuclear constituents . Although tagmemic theory is weak at this point , there
are areas of syntax for which the specification of the functions of constituents10
is necessary and revealing of the structures of the syntax . Where possible this
grammar of Alamblak attempts to explicate those cases where the functions of
constituents can be analysed and shown to be significant for the construction .
In other cases functions may be little more than suggestive labels for constitu­
ent positions in constructions .
1.4.2.3The expan ded tagmemeOne of the major developments in tagmemic theory since its conception has
been the expansion of the tagmeme . The expanded tagmeme has increased the amount
of information that is required to completely specify constituents and their
relationships to other constituents . A short-lived nine-box tagmeme (Hale
1974 : 57) was scaled down to a four-box tagmeme which adds a semantic dimension
to the correlation of function and category . An example of Franklin's ( 1969 : 18)
set of specifications for a clausal constituent is given in Table 2 .
Tabl e 2: Fo ur-box tagmeme ( Frankl i n 1 969)Functions
CategoriesGrammarSemanticsSubject
NounActor
CommonThe semantic functions of nominal clause constituents derive from Pike 's (1964)
'situational roles ' and refinements have benefited from the work of case grammar .
Clause-level tagmemes used in the present study are comparable in format
to Franklin ' s four-box tagmeme , with two differences . The first difference is
a terminological one; the term ' categories ' is replaced by ' exponents ' i . e .
the set o f units which expound a given function , following Longacre (1976 : 258ff) .
Secondly , the functions which qualify as semantic functions are restricted
to generalised semantic roles which are structurally marked in the clause .
Franklin ' s semantic functions of clause-level constituents , on the other hand,
are equivalent to covert semantic case roles as developed, for example, in case
grammar . As already indicated in this section , such specific roles cannot be
specified for tagmemes , which are abstract construction points of a construction
type ( c f . Longacre 1976 : 258) . Precise semantic roles , such as those employed
in case grammar , can only be specified after the individual lexical items are
selected to form the construction . That is , these roles are ultimately features
of semantic specifications of lexical items and not part of an abstract clause
type ( i . e . , construction type) . For example, the specific setting case marker
-n may indicate a time setting or an interior , surface , or adessive location
setting . The precise role of an exponent of the specific setting function is
determinable by the meanings of the lexical items of the clause in conjunction
with a role hierarchy; the role is not part of the specification of the NP type .
The precise role of the S .Setting NP in each clause in example 3 is indicated
by the translations .","[14, 15, 16]"

identify a referent which is relevant to the predication in some way .

non- motion verbs (v. example 300 in section 3 . 4 ) .

"3.7.3.3.2Overt coreference a n d swi tch referenceIn the last section we have discussed dependent clauses with reduced
verbs ( i . e . verbs with no actor or undergoer markers ) . In thi s section we
examine some of the relationships between clauses with fully inflected
predicates . The switch-reference system which will be discussed in the f inal

and in the other i t is not .
Overt CoreferenceThe verbal pronominal suffixes coreference participants which are
identifiable e ither in the l ingu istic discourse or in the si tuational context .
In general there are no syntactic constraints on when verbal pronominal
suffixes may be employed as the only means of referencing the most prominent
participants in a given clause . For this reason most two-place clauses do
not manifest both subj ect and inner object NP ' s in the clause . Often ne i ther
is expressed . There are restrictions , however , with the less naturally salient
participants , i . e . those manifesting orientation roles in the clause . Predi­
cates of case frames 1 and 2 (Table 101) potentially coreference orientation
roles with the undergoer suffix as nuclear roles . The verbal pronominal suffix
may be the sole reference to these participants in a clause only if the noun
phrase which i s coreferenced i s extant in the same clause or an associated clause
of the same sentence . Thus , the sentence unit is the limit of the scope of
pronominal suffixes which are coreferencing participants with orientation roles .",[299]

"Example 3 39 i llustrates a general restriction on the inner obj ec t . An
inner ob ject must be ' crucial to the predication ' ( cf . the definition of
undergoer p . 2 1 9 ) . Locative and temporal references are not normally so
importan t , unless they are a point of discuss ion in a discourse and thus
marked as definite . A noun phrase manifesting an orientation role may be
marked as crucial to the predication if it indicates a specific referent
or is marked by verbal aspects so as to emphasise its importance . The
common verb roh sitting ( case frame 1 ) , if unmarked for adverbial aspect
will not coreference a non-specific locative inner obj ec t . Thus , *kun- t

unacceptable , whereas kun - t kor-has i -w- r-t ( house- 3 SF sit ting CONT . at­
IMPF-3SM-3SF ) , He is remaining in a house, is much more acceptable . If
the locative or temporal referent noun phrase is definite or specific , it
readily as sume s an undergoer function , e . g . nanho kun - t dbehnay- r - t (my
house- 3 SF siak- 3SM- 3SF ) , He was sick in my house . other semantic roles
are more natural ly crucial to particular predications and are not so
constrained , e . g . a patient inner obj ect may be non-spec ific . Case frame
4 verbs host a locative role obligatorily ; the inherent importance of a
location to that class of verbs means that a locative inner obj ect need
not indicate a spec ific referent . The coreferencing of orientation roles
is considered further in section 3 . 7 . 4 . 2 where constraints on coreference
between clauses are discussed .",[316]
"3.5.2.2.3Other fea tures of tran s i t i v i tyIn case-frames one and two , there is only one obli gatory NP . When there
are two ( one man i festing an agent or patient , and another mani festing a locative
or temporal role coreferenced as undergoer) , the undergoer is usually marked as
definite . Thus , the predi cates of case-frame one and two may structurally
parallel other transitive predicates , i . e . increase in transitivity , i f the
inner obj ect is highly individuated . The effect of causativisation on c ase­

participant , it manifests no features of trans itivi ty ; there is only one
participant and it has none of the features of an actor , i . e . is ne i ther
performer , c auser , controller , nor wil l ingly active . This form may be causativ­
ised ( a feature of low trans i tivity ) , whereby the actor is now the causer o f
the state which has a n e ffect upon the undergoer .",[240]

3. 1 .0Non -verba l word c l asses
I n troducti onIn this section we will first of all outline the word classes of Alarnblak .
Secondly , the non -verbal classes will be described in their basic unexpanded
form. Morpho-syntactic criteria will be used to distinguish twelve major word
classes not including verbs . The internal morphological structure used to
identify the word classes will be discussed more fully in section 3 . 2 where
questions of grammatical levels ( i . e . stem, word , phrase) and their definitions
will be considered . The discussion there on grammatical levels will refine the
discussion in this section so that the basic grammatical categories elaborated
here will be referred to as roots rather than words .
3.1 .1Word cl assesFormal word classes in Alamblak are identified by morpho-syntactic criteria .
That is , basic root forms are classed together according to their potential to
host certain bound morphemes . The word classes and subclasses are summarised in
Table 20 .
Inflectable roots ( i . e . , words) are distinguished from non-inflectable
roots ( i . e . , particles) . Adverbs contrast with all other word classes by their
restriction from hosting the copula and elevational markers . Next , the verb
classes can be distinguished from non-verbals . The internal structure which is
unique to verbs ( e . g . tense , aspect , mood , etc . ) will be discussed i n section
3 . 3 . Non-verbals may be inflected with possessive and emphatic affixes , the
modifier enclitic - s k deteriorated , and the specific setting case marker , and
they may be conjoined by the coordinate conjunction (cf . line three in Table 20) .
Other subclassifications are possible . Adjectives and some verbs are
similar in that they host the process derivational - t ay (Table 20 line four) .
The deictic-like pronouns , adjectives , personal names , and kin terms of address
contrast with nominals and verbs by not hosting the possessed suffix -et which
may occur with nominals and verbs (line six) . Adverbs are similar to the non­
inflectable particle class in that they may occur as free forms in the clause .
As it will become clear in section 3 . 2 , however , words in all other classes
must be inflected when occurring as a minimal exponent of a clause-level slot .","[78, 79]"
"Examples 294 need not be interpreted reflexively if another subject or object
is understood in the linguistic or extralinguistic context . See section
3 . 5 . 2 . 2 . 2 for a detailed discussion of reflexivity .
3.4.2Peri pheral noun phrases ( case mar k i ng )The noun phrases discussed here may be considered to be those bearing
non-nuclear grammatical relations to the verb in the clause . 9 9 It is easier
to associate these NP ' s with specific semantic roles than it is with nuclear
NP ' s (cf. section 3 . 5 . 1 , role structure) .
An overview of relations encoded by the peripheral ' relator - related '
phrases is given in Table 87 .
Several of the ' case ' enclitics may encode more than one meaning. Specific
rules for encoding or interpreting the appropriate meaning are discussed with
each phrase . For exan�le , the adessive NP plus a motion verb encodes ' to ' as
its meaning; with a non-motion verb , the adessive NP encodes ' at ' as its meaning.
The peripheral NP ' s structurally group into three types depending on the
presence or absence of terminator slots and/or their ordering relative to other
function slots . Table 88-90 present an overview of basic structural contrasts
between peripheral NP ' s . Exponents of the terminator function are person-number­
gender markers ( cf. Table 34 , p . 96) . The emphatic and elevational markers are
explicated in sections 3 . 2 . 3 . 1 . 2 and 3 . 2 . 3 . 1 . 3 .",[201]

The remainder of the numeral system is described in Appendix B. With the
additional constructions described there , the numeral system theoretically has
the potential of for ing any numeral . In practice , however , only a limited
number of digits are formed in this system. The level of acceptable efficiency
of the system seems to include numerals 1-10 and then by tens to forty . The
greates t operating e fficiency is in the 1-5 zone . Higher numerals are frequently
expre ssed in the New Guinea Pidgin system . I t is certainly the case that
numerals other than those mentioned would not be formed in the vernacular
system as quantifiers in a noun phrase . Higher numerals in the vernacular
system would only be used for counting or tallying . Other counting systems ,
vi z . the money-counting system and the traditional tally system will be
discussed in Appendix B with these higher , counter numerals .","[109, 110]"

nounsEmbedded clauses 1) typically exhibit a non-finite verb form, without
actor and undergoer pronominal markers ( c f . 3 . 3 . 1 . 2 . 1 ) , 2) potentially
incorporate nouns into the verb (cf . 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 ) , and 3) potentially employ
genitive forms of noun phrases corresponding to nuclear NP ' s of independent
clau se s . These features contrast with independent clauses which do not have
genitivised nuclear NP ' s , and they tend to neither exhibit non-finite verbs
nor incorporate nouns into the verb , but they do employ person markers . By
these features , then , the embedded clauses near the top of Table 127 are the
most sentential . The relative clauses ( including the (non) -possessed modifier )
and nominal clauses are described i n section 3 . 2 . The others , i . e . the
adverbial clauses , are described in the next section .
The phenomenon of noun incorporation is discussed in section 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 , for
both independent and embedded clauses . The pattern of genitivisation is
basically that the nuclear noun phrase which is least accessible to verbal
cross -referencing in independent clauses is most accessible to genitivisation
in embedded clauses . Formally , an ergative pattern is followed with subjects
of intrans itives and obj ects of transitives being optionally marked with the
genitive ( i . e . pos sessive ) marker . with three-place predicates , the outer
obj ect ( i . e . ' patient ' noun) is marked wi th the geni tive . I f both the inner
obj ect ( i . e . ' benefactive ' or ' recipient ' noun) and outer obj ec t are mani fested ,
the inner obj ect will be genitivised only if the outer object is incorporated
into the verb , which is the typical case if there are two or three arguments
extant in the clause . The nominal clause varies slightly from this pattern as
discu ssed in section 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 6 . 2 . Noun phrases with peripheral semantic roles
( i . e . locationals , etc . ) may occur as an outer object in the genitive form if
one of the two object positions is available . Thus , syntactic doubling of
genitivised objects i s disallowed .","[291, 292]"
"The high probability of these verbs being in a reflexive form i s one reason
that a second participant ( locative or temporal re ference) may manifest the
undergoer function without much chance of ambiguity ( interpreting the undergoer
as either an orientation or a participant rol e ) .
Predicates of case-frame nine ( e . g . ' rub ' ) are simi lar to refl exive verbs
of case-frame eight in that they host an affective role and thus c annot take
a benefactive form.
Case-frame nine di ffers from c ase- frame eight in certain ways as wel l .
For example , the trans itivi ty factor is higher since it potential ly hos ts a2 38third nuclear participant . Furthermore , the undergoer marker cannot corefe rence
an NP with an orientation role in reflexive forms due to the role hierarchy for
unde rgoer selection , which restricts orientation ro les from the undergoer
function when a patient role potentially may occur in the undergoer slo t .
Predi cates o f case-frame ten (e . g . ' put ' ) are highly transitive with a
potential for three nuc lear participants . When the third participant ( locative )
is mani fes ted as a nuclear participan t , i t may occur as inner obj ect ( undergoer
function) thus superseding a patient role , which is higher on the ro le hierarchy
for selecting the undergoer function ; the patient then occurs as the outer
ob j ect . This is permi ssible only because the locative role coalesces with the
affective role , which supersedes a patient for the selection of undergoer . The
affe ctive role with an inanimate location indicates a total ( in contrast to a
partial ) affect of the re feren t . This feature o f total a ffect of the undergoer
is one of the features of high transitivity suggested by Hopper and Thompson
( 1980) .
The semantic contrast between sentences having the locative role
amal gamated with a ffective as an inner obj ect and those with the locative role
as a peripheral c ase-marked NP is i l lustrated in example 349 . An animate
location in the affective role indicates affectedness ; in a locational role

"The linking morphemes function to conjoin two or more phrases which are
equivalent in their grammatical and semantic roles . By grammatical role we
mean roles such as subj ect , and by semantic roles we mean case roles s uch as
agent , patient , etc . Coordinate structures function as a unit with no one
member s ingled out as being more in perspective or more referentially prominent
than the other members of the construc tion .
The coordinating conj unction contrasts in function with the conj unction of
a comitative construction ( c f . below) .",[135]
"239
3.5.2.2.4Syn tact i c i n a l i enab l e posses s i onThe discussion of transitivity thus far has focussed on selectional
features of verbs and how certain derived constructions modify basic case
frames of verbs . The selection of clause constituents themselves may also
modify the basic case frame of predicates . In particular , the selection of
an inalienably -possessed item will affect the case frame of a verb since its
presence automatically implies the presence of another entity ( the possessor)
which is inextricably involved with the possessed item. Given the necessity
of a second entity , a role may be assigned to it in the clause , either as
affective or referent.
An inalienable possession in Alamblak is an item which is thought to be
an integral part or possession of an animate being. Specifically , these items
include body par ts , names , and odours .
Predicates of case - frames one (e . g . ' die ' ) and three ( e . g . ' heavy ' ) may
select inalienable possessions as actors ( force role) . Case - frames five (e . g .
' be startled ' ) , six ( e . g . ' see ' ) , and seven ( e . g . ' pierce ' ) may select
inalienable possessions as undergoers or objects ( i . e . inner objects or outer
objects) in a referent role . Case frame nine (e . g . ' rub ' ) may select
inalien­
able possessions as undergoers or objects ( in a patient role) . 1 1 2
The case frames of basic classes one and three thus modified by the
presence of an inalienable possession have the form :
[ ---- �
For �
Pat J .
There are several possible configurations of a clause involving an inalienably­
possessed item. Clauses with items of inalienable possession, with the
possessor as patient role (case - frames one and three) , occur in the following
patterns :[

"1063.2.3.2.4.1Genera l rel ati ve c l auseThe first outer modifier to be discussed i s the general relative clause
which is described in Table 40 . As noted there , the peripheral functions are
the same as they are for independent c lauses . The distinctions between the
three nuclear functions in independent clauses , subject , inner obj ect , and
outer obj e c t , are never completely maintained in the general relative clause ,
however . The reason for this loss of grammatical contrast is that the reduced
form of the verb lacks the pronominal af fixes which identify the functions of
each nuclear NP in independent clauses .
There are two relativisation s trategies within the framework of the general
re lative Clause . Sub j ects , obj ec ts , and obliques are relativised on wi th a
non-case-encoding strategy . 6 3 This s trategy employs the general relative clause
without manifesting the optional terminator plus relator complex ( c f . Table 40) .
The head noun being relativised on 6 4 is not explic itly referred to within the
relative clause , nor is there any indication of its semantic role within the
relative clause . Of the oblique NP ' s , a comi tative is not relativisable ( c f .
the dis cussion of the c omitat�ve in section 3 . 4 . 2 . 3 which concludes that the
comitative is a conjoined rather than a case-marked NP ) . Neither is the obj ect
of a comparative relativisable .
The s trategy which employs the relative clause with the terminator plus
relator is used to relativise on the genitive ( i . e . possessor ) of a possessive
phrase . In that strategy the genitive case of the head noun is indicated by
the relator ,
' genitive ' within the relative clause . These two relativisation
strategies are i l lust:rated in examples 1 7 5 and 176 . Before those examples are
given , we will d iscuss the function slots of the general relative clause and
their exponents in more detai l .-hoNuclear NP functions of the GEN REL clauseThe nuclear NP ' s of the general relative c lause are never completely
distinguishable gramnlatically . The subj ect NP is distinguished from the i nner
and outer obj ects 6 5 in that it may never be manifested by an NP base ( i . e . a
noun whi ch is incorporated in the verb stem) in multiplace predicates . Inner
and o uter o bj ects may be expressed by NP ' s or NP bases . Ultimately the latter
two can only be distinguished by appeal ing to d i fferent semantic roles which
they encode in independent clauses . Thus an NP which expresses an affective
role is interpreted to be an i nner object because only i nner objects encode the
a ffective role in independent clauses .
Examples in 1 7 1 i l lustrate nuclear NP ' s of the relative clause manifested
both as NP ' s and as NP bases .

"Role structure is still a part of clause structure . Only generalised roles ,
however, are indicated by the structure of the clause . For ·nuclear NP ' s we
employ three generalised roles - Actor, Undergoer, and Object ( cf . A . Hale 1 9 7 4 ) .
The number of roles for peripheral NP ' s varies greatly according to the
particular encoding conventions there are in a given language . Roles encoded
by peripheral NP ' s in Alamblak are discussed in Section 3 . 5 .
A full specification of the features o f a four-box tagmeme i s frequently
unenlightening or redundant . Hale ( 19 74 : 5 7- 5 8 ) , referring to this fact,
suggests that , ""the degree to which any given tagmeme shows redundancy among
its cell is currently taken as a measure of the peripherality of the tagmeme . ""
More disturbing to the theory is the possibility that there may be no distinc­
tion between grammatical and semantic functions for most constituents . Only
nuclear NP ' s seem to be clearly multi - functional elements in the clause . Thus
the -n case-marked NP ' s in example 3 function simply as specific setting NP ' s .
It would be artificial to postulate two separate terms for grammatical and
semantic functions unt�l such contrasting functions can be clearly motivated .
It is redundant to specify both functions in many cases even for nuclear
NP ' s . In Alamblak , for example , using the terminology employed herein , the
subject is predictably the actor, the inner object is predictably the undergoer,
and the outer object the object . The distinction between gramma tical and
semantic function is maintained here , however , in view of the evidence that the
subject function is a complex notion . Subject is predictably actor only
because it is by definition a conflation of referential prominence and actor
role . The notion subject is only used where there is a conflation of referential
prominence and actor role . When those two properties are separated, the gram­
matical function of referential prominence (RP) must be used in conjunction
with a different semantic function e . g . undergoer . The specification o f an NP
as both RP and actor ( i . e . subject) is not redundant therefore , since an RP
may also function semantically as undergoer . The four -box tagmeme is retained,
then, largely for the sake of one or two NP types which are nuclear to the
clause . Its usefulness as a descriptive device for all constructions
in the
grammatical hierarchy must be seriously questioned , however . l l12There is a fourth feature at the intersection of Franklin ' s parameters of
categories and semantics . This feature identifies semantic features of classes
of exponents which expound a given function . This specification of construction
points ( i . e . tagmer�es) is infrequently used in this work , being information
which is also largely relegated to the lexicon . There are cases , however, where
constructions specify certain semantic features of certain exponents . For
example, nominal exponents of the related nucleus function of the allative NP
(cf . Table 98) are specified as [- animate ] . Thus krn i vi l lage may manifest
the head of an Al Nl' but y i rna person may not, as in example 4 .

Specific setting NP :Interior location
Surface location

Temporal referenceThe interpretation s trategy for the spe c i fi c setting case includes an
interpretation hierarchy as follows :
Temporal re ference - with time words
Interior location > Surface location > Adessive - with other nouns
The second part of the s trategy means that the le ft-most interpretation which
is compatible with the case-marked noun and the rest of the clause wi ll be214chosen as the interpretation of the c ase marker . For example , the specific
setting marker will relate the predicate to the interior of a three-dimensional
ob j ect where that interpretation is compatible with the predicate and partici­
pants in the c l ause . If the ' interior location ' is not compatible with the
re st of the c lause , then the ' surface location ' role wil l be appl ied , etc .

"3.7.3Ro l e s tructure of dependent c l ausesEmbedded c lauses ( Table 1 2 7 ) , adverbial c lauses , and two subordinate
clauses (viz . the truncated clause and the infinitive complement) lack semantic
ro le encoding suffixes on the verb . The roles of the participants of the
clauses , therefore , must either be identified in some other way , or they must
remain unmarked requiring interpretation according to context . In general ,
the role encoding systems in these clauses will not be as precise as that of
independent c lauses ; more cases of structural ambiguity are allowed in
subordinate c lauses where there are potentially more contextual clues for
identifying the roles of the participants . There are three mechanisms for
encoding role structure in these clauses , word order , genitive case marking
on nuclear participants , and rules of coreference between the actor participants
of the dependent and independent clause .",[296]
"90
Features of words include 1) isolability as minimal utterances no part of which
is itself isolable , 2) permutability as units in a sentence , 3 ) rigidity of
ordering of constituent parts , 4) uninterruptibility of constituent parts (unless
a new word is formea by an interrupting formative) , 5) the constituent parts
of words have different syntagmatic functions (which are non-syntactic) from
those in phrases , 6) units are classed as words by analogy with clear cases
where they are otherwise indeterminate .
Lyons disallows semantic definitions since no definition will apply to
words without also applying to phrases . He also disallows phonological
definitions due to the lack of total congruence of phonological and grammatical
levels and also because of the fact that languages differ as to the matching
they make between the basic rhythm-stress phonological unit and a particular
grammatical level (word or phrase) .
Features two , three , and four are features of phrases as well as words ,
the difference being only a matter of degree . That is , words typically exhibit
greater mobility as a unit within a sentence than phrases , and they show a
greater degree of rigidity in the ordering of constituent parts than phrases . 5 4
Features five and six can only be used as secondary criteria for distinguishing
words and phrases due to their circularity . We are left with one feature ,
isolability , which provides a fairly clear contrast between words and phrases .
There are problems even with this feature , however , as has been widely discussed
(cf. Matthews 1974 : 160 - 61) .
It is not surprising that with these defining features , indeterminacy
( fuzzy borders) is to be expected between levels as between other units (Pike
1967 : 438) . This may not be a negative factor , however . Given the functional
similarity of words and phrases , a merging of the two levels grammatically
need not be too surprising.
3.2.1 .1P h rase l evelThe noun phrase in Alamblak is analysable into two parts : a base and a
terminating complex of phrasal enclitics . The base consists of constructions
or morphemes such as determiners , quantifiers , modifiers , the nucleus ( i . e .
head) and modifying and limiting enclitics . The phrasal enclitics include
person-number-gender .markers , relators (case marking) , elevationals and
emphatic marker .
A simple noun phrase exhibits both word-like and phrase - like characteristics
according to the features discussed above . Example 149 will be analysed in
terms of those features .

"The appropriateness of a role for a participant in a given situation is
dependent on the meanings of the verb and the noun phrase which identi fies the
parti cipant . participant roles , then , are essentially features of the semantics
of individual verbs and as such are not di rectly encoded by the syntax .
The syntax establi shes only three types of constituents which can encode
participant roles , vi z . , subject , inner obj ect and outer ob j ec t . The encoding
of participant roles in a clause is one of the maj o r functions of these three
nuclear constituents ; other functions are discussed in section 3 . 5 . 2 . 3 . The
verbal pronominal markers , which are largely responsible for identifying the
nuclear NP ' s , are speci fically the indicators of the roles of the subj ect and
inner ob j ect and , by inference , the outer obj e c t . The verb agreement markers ,
therefore , wi l l dominate our discussion of the case marking system which encodes
the partic ipant roles . They may be semantically characterised as general frame­
works or general ised ro le indicators within which specific roles of nuclear
participants of the clause can be predicted by the class of the verb in the
predicate .
The first agreement suffix on the verb , which coreferences what has
tentatively been described as the subject , mani fests an actor function . 1 0 4
The second agreement suffix , which coreferences the inner obj ect , mani fests an
undergoer function . These functions will be defined shortly . The third
nuclear NP , the one which is not coreferenced on the verb , mani fests the ob j ect
function .
The terms "" actor"" and "" undergoer"" are adapted from A . Hale ( 19 7 4 ) . Hale ' s
third role is termed the "" si te "" . He never expli citly associates his roles with
the grammatical relations of subject , direct obj ect and indirect obj ect ,
although the parallel is obvious .
Hale has res tricted his role.s to de fining relationships ""wi thout incorpor­
ating elements which s hould actually be analysed as parts of the meanings of
individual lexical i tems "" (Hale 1974 : 61 ) . The system of semantic roles he
devises is perhaps the leas t abstract yet propos ed . More abstract role systems
pro li ferate the number of roles by making finer distinctions between them ,
e . g . Longacre ( 1 9 7 6 : 2 5 ) has compared nine case role systems which vary from
three to fi fteen roles . Longacre ( 1976 : 36 ) s uggests that s tructures o f differ­
ent degrees of abstractness do coexis t and that they ""correspond to varying
goals and applications of theory "" . ! 0 5218
3.5.1 .3.1Actor person markerThe first pronominal suffix on the verb functions to designate the actor ,
i . e . A ( ct ) , in the si tuation predicated by the clause . The actor func tion may
be defined as the participant which may be thought of as the causer or performer
o f , or at the least the entity whose state is predicated by the predic ate .
Actor person marker :Agent
Force
Control led experiencer
Uncontrolled experiencer
Experiencer
PatientThe actor marker can serve to encode agent , force , experiencer , controlled
expe rience r , uncontrolled experiencer , and patient roles which vary in the
degree to which they may be thought of as being performers or causers of a
predication . Di f ferent agents may vary along the same l ines as we ll , indicating
that the semantic case roles are not primitive notions . 1 0 6 This variab i l i ty
will fi gure in the discuss ion on features of trans itivity in section 3 . 5 . 2 . 2 .
There is a neutralisation in the ac tor function between typical agentive
roles and the non-agentive patient role in intransitive type predications .
This neutralis ation is typical of mos t languages which do not di fferentiate
thes e roles in one-place predications .

Case frame D exhibits the same verb root configuration as frame C but i t diffe rs
from case frame C in that the actors of the two verb roots are coreferential .
Theoretically , any combination o f verb roots may occur since doubling o f agents
wi l l not occur , there being only one agent . Case frame D exhibits a detransi­
tivised form with no participant coreferenced as undergoer ( as in reflexive
forms ) . Thi s ' re fl exive ' form is the means of encoding the fact that the
actors of the two verb roots are coreferential . In other words , the undergoer
of the first verb root is not the actor of the second as in case frame C . With
that restri ction goes the impl ication that there is not necessarily any cause­
e ffect rel ationship between the two situations referred to by the two verb roots .
The construction simply indicates either a simultaneous or s equential relation­
ship between the two s i tuations . 1 1 3

"3.5.2.2.2Causa t i ve , benefact i ve , refl ex i ve and rec i procal processesValency change and the gramma tical roles of the causee and affecteeThe causative process increases trans itivity generally by adding one
participant . In most cases the additional participant is marked as actor and
is the caus er of the state or event . The causee , manifesting the undergoer
function , usually functions l ike an actor (with agent , force , patient , or one
of the experiencer roles ) .
Synthetic causativisation is restricted to intrans itive-l ike verbs
deriving two-place causative constructions from them with the causee in the
grammatical role of inner obj ect . Causative expressions formed with two- or
three-place verbs are normal ly analytical in nature . Experiencer verbs are
interesting examples to examine more closely s ince they are deviant in various
ways . Two types of expe riencer verbs will be discussed in this respect in the
next section .
It is very unusual for a language to have morphological causative con­
structions which are restri cted to basi cally intransi tive predicates . The
explanation for thi s constraint i s to be found in the hi storical origin o f
causatives i n Alamblak , vi z . , the serial verb construction . Thi s point i s
taken up in section 3 . 5 . 2 . 2 . 5 where case frames of serial constructions are
dis cussed .
Like the causative construction , a bene factive construction , also adds a
participant , thus increas ing transitivi ty . The additional participant functions
as an undergoer in the affective role , i . e . is an animate obj ect which i s
psychologically affected , or a n inanimate entity which is totally affected .
A maj or diffe rence between causative and benefactive structures has to do
with valency changes . Whereas causatives are restricted to deriving 2-place
predicates from 1/2-place verbs ( or intrans i tive-like 2-place verbs in the
case of uncontrol led experiencer verbs) benefactives may derive 2-place or
3 -place verbs from 1/2-place and 2-place verbs . Benefactives can derive
4-place verbs from 3-place locatives but not from basic 3-place verbs .
Example 351 ( a) il lus trates a derived 3-place benefactive and example (b) is
an ungrammatical causative construction with the same verb .

"212Most manifestations of the referent N P have potentially vague or ambiguous
interpretations . An ' ambiguity ' implies that a construction has the possibility
of two or more interpretations involving distinct semantic roles . The hearer
must make a choice since the construction must mean one thing or another but not
either or both . By ' vagueness ' it is meant that the construction in question
does not specify one way or the other but may be understood with any of its
possible interpretations .
One case of vagueness arises when a time word manifests the head of
the referent NP . It may be interpreted either as a simple point-of- reference
or as an efficient cause role . Example 308 ( a) in section 3 . 4 is repeated here
as example 3 2 5 .
325 .tnd yha - r -pne dbehna-me-w-mDEM time- 3SM-REF sick - R . PST-IMPF- 3PL
{ At this time they were continual ly sick.
A t this time and because of i t they were continua l ly sick. }The vagueness arising from a sentence like example 325 has to do with
conceptualisation processes . When two events or an event and a particular time
or location are frequently associated together , an observer is likely to inter­
pret the whole situation as involving a cause-and-effect relationship.
Two cases of ambiguity can be discussed : when a referent noun phrase
exhibiting an animate nucleus co-occurs with a motion verb , and when certain
motion verbs co-occur with certain reference NP ' s exhibiting inanimate head
nouns .
When a referent noun phrase exhibiting an animate head noun co- occurs with
a motion verb it could potentially be interpreted as comitative , allative , or
elative . If the particular exponents of the head noun and predicate in a given
context do not select a particular interpretation for the referent NP , an
interpretation strategy will operate as follows :
REF NP : Comitative > Allative > Elative
For example ,

from }{}The referent NP in example 326 will receive a comitative interpretation unless
the context does not allow it, in which case the allative interpretation will
be chosen, or , as a final option, the elative interpretation .
Another ambiguous construction results when certain motion verbs co-occur
with certain referent noun phrases with inanimate heads . In these cases , the
referent NP may be either efficient cause , comitative , allative , or elative .

Basic structural patterns of traditional D.O. and 1 . 0 . are coincident with
Alamblak patterns for inner object and outer object , respectively . Namely , the
D.O. in traditional grammar is structurally the s�ne in both transitive and
ditransitive clauses . Similarly , the Alamblak inner object is identified in
one way (by verb agreement) for multiple-place clauses .
The pattern of mapping semantic case roles onto D.O. and 1 . 0 . , however , is
not the same as the Alamblak mapping onto inner object and outer object. The
semantic case role traditionally associated with D.O. ( i . e . , patient) is the
same for transitive and ditransitive clauses alike . For Alamblak , however , the
roles encoded by inner object are not the same for two-place and three-place
clauses . The differences are diagr�atically represented in Table 100 . 1 0 0

P ronounsPronouns are distinguished as a class essentially negatively according to
affixes they cannot host (cf . especially lines 4-6 in Table 20) . There are
two sets of pronouns : personal pronouns (Tables 21 and 22) and the emphatic/
reflexive pronoun (cf . Table 23) .
The traditionally unified paradigm of personal pronouns has been divided
into two Tables 21 and 22 . The reasons for making this distinction are discussed
in section 3 . 2 . 4 . 2 .

Theoretically the question of vowel-less words has been debated for some
time . Vowel-less words have been reported for the Salishan languages of the
west coast of North America , particularly Bella Coola (Newman 1947) , Lendu of
the Central Sudanic languages (Greenberg 1962) , Kabardian (Kuipers 1960) and
Kalam of Papua New Guinea (Pawley 1966) .
Kuipers has not been able to convince everyone that Kabardian lacks a
vowel-consonant dichotomy (cf. Pittman 1963 and Halle 1970) . Hockett ( 1955 : 57)
accepts the Bella Coola analysis by Newman, making allowances for vowel - less
onset type syllables in his Handbook of Phonol ogy . pike (1967 :419) , on the
other hand , is somewhat uncertain of the Bella Coola analysis . Greenberg
(1962) challenges the traditional Bella Coola analysis suggesting that syllabic
frictional continuants in some syllables maintain the vowel-consonant dichotomy
in Bella Coola as they do also in Lendu and , as Olson ( 1967) reports , in Chipaya
of Bolivia.
If all predictable [ + J ' s were analysed as non-phonemic transition vocoids
in Alamblak without a constraint of having a minimum of one phonemic vowel in
each word , then vowel-less words would occur in Alamblak as well . Some of
these would be composed entirely of stop phonemes e . g . , Ibktl [ ' b+ k+ t J Zocus t .
It would be difficult to interpret any of the stops in Ibktl as a syllabic
segment forming the peak of the syllable and thus the vowel-consonant dichotomy
would be seriously challenged (but only at the underlying level of represen­
tation) . Even though some indeterminacies still remain , this analysis favours
not allowing vowel-less words . The reasons for this conclusion are that allow­
ing vowel-less words does not simplify the phoneme inventory , and all words
which can be tested by presently worked out methods prove to have at least one
underlying vowel ; other words are interpreted as following the same pattern .
2.3.4The three-central -vowe l hypothes i s as a poss i b l e reconstructi onThe indeterminacies in many areas of Alamblak phonology can be explained
by viewing the system as a whole and the ways in which it has been changing.
A model which seems to account for the present Alamblak system best is
described as follows : In a proto - , or perhaps pre-Alamblak system a three­
vowel system ( + , a , a ) operated with stringent restrictions on vowel clusters
(perhaps no vowel clusters at all as appears to be the case now with Ndu
languages) . Vowels were separated by approximants (or approximants and glottal
stop as in the case of Ndu languages) . Approximants modified central vowels
producing front and back allophones . In some cases the central vowel and
approximant coalesced whereby apparently independent (unconditioned) front
and back vocoids were produced . In cases where non-central vocoids resulted
from a relatively abstract underlying form through complicated phonological
rules , the final phonetic output was reinterpreted as the underlying form. In
some cases morphemes with this new vowel served as a model for reinterpretations
of other underlying forms . In this way non-central vowels became a part of the
vowel inventory . With a five- or seven-vowel system, vowel clusters then
occurred and consonant clusters were highly restricted (as appears to be the
case in Sumariup , a neighbouring language to Alamblak , where close transition
in Alamblak seems to correspond to a [ + J in Sumariup) .
As modifications and fusions involving central vowels (especially 1+/)
were reinterpreted as non-central vowels , the functional load of the central
vowels decreased . The most tenuous vowel (/+/) , being phonetically very short,70
began to be phased out of the system. Thereupon allowable consonant clusters
occurred with or without the intervening [ t ] with factors of timing and
emphasis affecting their manifestations . The remaining It/ ' s became a weak
vowel in the system with respect to stress rules and susceptibility to elision
next to other vowels and between consonants which could cluster . This appears
to be the present status of the Alamblak system. Kalam (Pawley : 1966) may
represent a later stage with completely predictable transition vocoids in a
three vowel system with both vowel and consonant clusters moderately restricted .
(Whether or not Kalam can be compared historically with Sepik phonologies is
a matter of debate . )
Sepik vowel systems are undergoing a general influence which may add to
the tendency toward similar developments in many Sepik languages . The influence
is that of New Guinea Pidgin which is spoken throughout the Sepik area . Its
vowel system consists of primarily front and back vowels ( i , e , 0) as well
as central / a / . The influence of Pidgin English is undoubtedly a factor which
gives added impetus to tendencies to phonemicise non-central vowels .
If such a model is a valid approximation of the general situation, then it
serves as an explanation for the difficulty in determining the status of the
high central vocoid in many instances in Alamblak . It is simply losing ground
in Alamblak phonology . As such it is contrastive only to a limited extent . In
some cases /t/ is distinctive in a word where it contrasts with close transition
in analogous position in another word; in all environments it is the lowest
ranked of syllable peaks with respect to stress placement. Noun-stern-finally
it appears to have tecome regarded as an unnecessary redundancy and therefore
elides next to vowels and between certain consonants .
u ,2.4I n tonat i on 4 3Only a few of t.he more important and basic intonational patterns will be
mentioned here . These include patterns of statements , yes - no questions and
sentence medial subordinating ( i . e . ' suspensive ' ) patterns .
Bolinger ( 1978) , in his cross - linguistic study of intonation , has made
some general observations , some stated as universals and others as strong
tendencies . In the most general terms a rising intonation indicates not being
finished and a falling intonation indicates being finished. These general
patterns hold true for Alamblak .
Bolinger observes that utterance - final statements , commands , and Wh ques­
tions (all expressing assertiveness ) tend to manifest the same intonation
which is usually either a downglide within a nuclear syllable of relatively
high pitch ""or a downskip to the immediately following syllable"" (Bolinger
1978 : 492) . Secondly , he notes that ""non-final clause terminals"" and yes-no
questions tend to have the same intonation , which is usually his second
universal type of rising intonation . A third common type has a medial downward
obtrusion [ � ] which indicates antiassertiveness or down-toning .
In accordance with Bolinger ' s findings , utterance - final statements ,
commands , and content (Wh) questions in Alamblak manifest the falling inton­
ational pattern . This pattern manifests a gradually falling pitch to a low
pitch on the final syllable .","[74, 75, 76]"
"Thi s formulation essentially postulates an archis egment whi c h is even less
speci fied than the ' phoneme s ' in the distinctive feature matrix ( Table 3 )
to specify the underlying forms of non-alternating morphemes f itting the
structural description of the rule . To avoid distinguishing thi s Praguean-298
type archiphoneme from other archisegments ( i . e . unpronounceable under­
spec i fied segments ) the phonemic symbol Inl will be used to represent the
cases of the underspecified [ + nasal ] segment as well as the alveolar nasal
segment which is also underspecified but to a lesser degree . The potential
ambiguities of this double service of Inl are resolved in all cases by
phonetic transcriptions of the forms involved .
Thi s formu lation was chosen to describe the data instead of postulating a
more speci fied underlying nasal in order to catch something of the syn­
chronic s tate in its diachronic context . Some evidence is given in
section 2 . 1 . 1 . 3 for prenasali sation in Alamblak . If the cases described
by the NA rule are remnants of prenasalisation , then the results of
resegmentation diachronically are better described in terms of a neutral­
isation through limited distribution rather than by positing a single
arbitrary underlying nasal segment . In thi s cas e , then , the class of
phones represented in the first environment of the rule ( non-f ront , non­
nasal , voiced stops) is a natural class which are slower to completely
lose the feature of prenasalisation diachronically than are the front ,
voiced or voiceless and non-front , voiceless stops . The voiceless
affricated palatoalveolar s top is the exception to that generalisation .
It may be pos s ible to j usti fy including the voiceless palatoalveolar s top
within that generalisation by claiming that i t loses prenasalisation s lower
than other voi celess , non-front stops . It is also possible to r emove i t
from the rule here and account for the phenomenon b y another phonological
rule where , in the case of palatal ass imi lation , it could easi ly motivate
pos iting an underlying Inl in the se cases . Such a solution would require
postulating fully abstract forms for non-alternating morphemes however ,
and thus i t has been rej ected here .

"3.5.2.2.1Case frames of s i mp l e verbsWe wi l l begin our discuss ion by presenting the ma j or verb classes which
range from low in transitivity to high in transitivity . Other predicate types

operating on a continuum rather than a system of discrete categories . I f that
is true , then c ategories , e . g . ve rb c l asses , based on the notion of transitivi ty
are l ikely to be only rough categories with overlap between them . Depending on

Verb c l as ses are based on contrasting c ase frames ( i . e . , the semantic roles
of the nuclear NP ' s ass9ci ated with the verb) , and the syntactic potential o f
the verb type t o undergo derivational processes which either add t o o r decrease
transitivi ty . In some c ases subclas s i fications are made on the basis of differ­
ing e ffects of applying these derivational processes to the basic case frame .
Case frames tend to proli ferate quickly ; Longacre ( 1976) l i s ts 48 logi cal ly
pos s ible verb c lasses based on case frames . Only a sampling of verb types will
be presented here ; even our sample wi l l not be fully speci fied for the
selectional features of each verb type . The selec tional features which are
speci fied are those which are particularly correlated with the syntac tic bas is
of a given verb clas s . The semantico-syntactic frames used here will include
( 1 ) Obl i gatory roles and ( 2 ) optional roles ( in parentheses ) which are diagnostic
to the verb c l as s (being encoded by nuclear NP ' s ) , and ( 3 ) the syntactic form
which encodes them , e . g . actor ( A) and undergoer ( U) verbal pronominal markers ,
outer ob j ect ( O . Obj ) , and c ase-marked noun phrases .
Modi fications o f these bas i c c ase frames c an be made by syntactic pro cesses
a ffecting the valency of the verb as wel l as by special exponents mani festing
the NP s lots in the clause . These modifi cations will be dealt with separately
in sections 3 . 5 . 2 . 2 . 2 ( causative , benefactive , e tc . ) and 3 . 5 . 2 . 2 . 4 ( inal ienable
