"7.2.1 Inflectional morphology
The sole nominal inflectional category is case marking. The category is highly
productive formally and semantically. Table 8 shows the paradigmatic nature
of case marking.79

characteristic of docking at the edge of a phrase. Compare for example (19ac).(17) a. nupigine
'of the female, you know'
b. nupi snigine 'of the two females, you know'
c. nupi

-two -GEN
of two, you know-ne
-SIIn (17a) the genitive is suffixed directly on the noun but in (17b,c), where a
numeral and adjective are added to the noun phrase, the case marker must be
suffixed at the right edge of the phrase and not to the noun. Like clitics, case
markers are promiscuous with regard to the lexical category with which they
can occur: in Chapter 4 and 6, examples of case markers with nouns, noun
phrases, relative clauses and adverbial clauses were discussed. Thus case
markers function as inflectional endings but operate formally as clitics.","[269, 270]"
"Chapter 4
Grammatical relations and information structureIn this chapter I discuss how grammatical relations are indicated in Meithei
and what the role of morphological case marking is in indicating these relations. As in many related languages, such as Lahu (Matisoff 1973b) and Lisu
(Hope 1974, Li and Thompson 1976), no reference is made in Meithei syntax
to the relations Subject, Agent and Object.28 Instead, Meithei is what Dixon
(1991, 1994) refers to as a ""pure"" language, where noun phrases are marked
according to their semantic role in a given instance of use of a verb. In terms
of Foley and Van Valin's (1984: 124) classification of inter-clausal syntax, Meithei is not a ""reference-dominated"" language where distinctions between grammatical relations and semantic roles are significant, but a ""role-dominated""
language, where such distinctions are not.
I provide evidence that notions such as subject and object are not necessary
in the description of Meithei clause structure. I show how verbs in Meithei
subcategorize for argument(s) with a specific semantic role indicated through
morphological marking. I also show how surface morphological marking is
often obscured through the overlay of a system of pragmatic marking which
deletes or replaces semantic role markers with pragmatic markers, and/or
manipulates word order for pragmatic effect. I will then describe how morphological case markers indicate the case of peripheral noun phrases.","[118, 119]"

"3.3.1.1 Pronouns: personal and possessive
The singular personal pronouns are ay Τ, naq 'you' and md 'he/she'. Possessive pronouns are formed through the suffixation of -ki 'genitive' on these
personal pronouns: aygi/natjgi/magi
yum 'my/your/his or her house'. The
possessive pronominal prefixes ι-, na- and ma- are the first person, second
person and third person possessive prefixes, respectively. These may be affixed
to kinship terms or inalienably possessed nouns.
(8)a . imit'my eye'b. nakhoq
c. mapa
d. mayum'your foot'
'his grandfather'
'his house'21The first person possessive prefix is more restricted in use than the second
or third person possessive prefixes since it appears only with kinship terms: so,
*iyum for 'my house' is ungrammatical but must be expressed as aygi yum.
There are also certain taboos on the use of the second person possessive with
kinship terms. N. Promodini Devi (1989a) reports that naqgi namd 'your
mother' is impolite; the socially acceptable form is the idiomatic sequence
natjgi imd which literally means 'your my mother'.
The choice between the use of a prefixed noun, such as ipa 'my father', or
the genitive and the prefixed noun, such as aygi ipa 'my father', is determined
by discourse factors: ipa is used when the father being spoken about has already been the topic of the conversation, while aygi ipa is used at the first
mention of father. This use of the genitive and prefixed possessive is the only
evidence of pronominal agreement in Meithei.

As shown in Table 1, personal pronouns may be plural or dual. The plural
is indicated by khoy 'this and others like this'. The dual is -bani, which is a
frozen form composed of w, the root for 'two', and -ba, probably the nominalizer -pa. The pronouns dealt with in this section are summarized in Table 1.

Indefinite pronouns are also lexicalized forms composed of a question word
(see section 5.6) which may be followed by -su 'also' (as in 10a,b) or the sequence kumbd composed of -kum 'like, kind of and -pd 'nominalizer' (see 10c).

-NOMA question word may also occur with the numeral m9 'one', which functions as
an indefinite article: this is seen in (lOd) with a verbal question word (i.e. a
question word suffixed by the inquisitive marker -no, see Chapter 6). (lOd)
can be opposed to (lOe): in (lOd) the pronoun refers to a specific person who
is seen but not identified, whereas (lOe) refers to an non-specific entity whose
presence can only be inferred (through the result of some action, for example).

'someone'The fact that indefinite pronouns are lexicalized forms is borne out by the morphology that can follow indefinite pronouns: the question word-numeral or
question word-enclitic-numeral sequence may be suffixed by the verbal negative
marker -ta (see lOf, g). The resulting form is apparently a noun since it may
be further suffixed by a case marker (see 10h). The negative marker cannot
be affixed to other nouns.

As noted in section 3.3 the strategy for creating relative clauses in Meithei is to
place the relativized noun directly after a nominalized clause; there is no relative pronoun to mark the relative clause. An additional but rarely exploited
strategy for creating a relative clause involves using a question word as a rela-3.3 Major lexical categories81tive pronoun (in conjunction with a quotative) to head the relative clause. See
section 6.1.2.3 for description and examples.","[104, 105, 106, 107]"
"4.3.6 Volitionality
A final fact needs to be addressed: all descriptions of Meithei postulate a
nominative case -na, obliterating the important distinction between the agentive
-na, which does mark case, and the homophonous contrastive marker -nd which
does not. The reason for this is that traditional grammars, which are written
either on the pattern of Sanskrit or Latin, expect a predictable case paradigm.
Educated native speakers consistently insert the purported nominative case
marker -nd on actor arguments in elicitation. This is an artifact of traditional
grammars since -nd does not occur in texts with more frequency than any of
the other pragmatic markers discussed in this section.
Recent descriptions such as Bhat and Ningomba (1986b), building on native
scholars' interpretation of Meithei grammar rather than on textual material,
also believe that there is a nominative case marker in Meithei, simply noting
that -nd is optional in sentences with noncausative verbs and that it can be
used on non-actor arguments. Bhat (1991) does address the optionality issue
by saying that -nd is used only when the action of the actor is volitional; however, it is easy to find sentences where this is not true. For example, in (27),
the -na marked actor refers to a daughter-in-law drowning (quite unintentionally) in a pond. It is also possible to find sentences where the subject does exercise control over an activity but is not marked by -nd (see (26d) above).

"3.3.1.4 Pronouns: demonstrative
The determiners -si 'proximate'23 and -tu 'distal' are stems that function as
enclitics, -si indicates that the object or person being spoken of is near or
currently seen or known to be near, even if not viewable by the speaker, or is
currently the topic of conversation; -tu signifies something or someone not
present at the time of speech or newly introduced in the conversation. There
are two pronouns based on these stems: sdu 'it (there)' and 3si 'it (here)'
where 3- is the attributive prefix. The determiner may occur either as an independent pronoun or encliticized on the noun phrase with no difference in
meaning (P. Madhubala Devi 1979: 158). Compare (11a) with ( l i b ) and (11c)
with (lid).

Two other demonstrative pronouns based on si and tu are masi 'this' and
madu 'that' (see section 7.2.1.4 for further description of ma- which derives
nouns from verbs).

-INQThis set of demonstrative pronouns can be suffixed by case markers like other
nouns. However, the meaning signalled by the resulting forms is idiosyncratic:
the proximate and distal meanings are lost and madu and masi act like sentence adverbs or conjunctions. Table 2 gives a list of the most common forms
of the demonstrative pronouns with ma- found in my corpus and the meanings
they signal. Chapter 6 provides a discussion of the function of these pronouns
as clausal subordinators.

"6.5.4 Clausal coordination
Finite clauses can be related to each other through the use of coordinators
which are based on the pronoun adu 'that' and one of the oblique case markers. Corresponding forms with the proximate determiner -si do not appear as
coordinators. Each coordinator of the form determiner-case marker has a
specialized function.
The coordinator aduda 'at that, because of that', composed of adu 'that' and
-ta 'locative', indicates a cause clause as in (22a).

"As reflected in phrase structure rule (lb), the asterisk which follows the noun
phrase indicates (following the convention used in Hale 1983) that the verb
may occur with any number of noun phrases. There is no particular order
imposed on the arguments; instead, word order is determined by pragmatic
factors (see Chapter 4 for details). The maximum number of noun phrases
that may occur with a verb is restricted by the subcategorization frame of that
verb (see section 4.2). Since Meithei allows for the omission of arguments, the
minimum number of noun phrases that may occur with a V is zero.
To be grammatical, a sentence must consist of an inflected verb, that is, a
verb root and an inflectional suffix. All inflectional suffixes are illocutionary
mood markers which indicate sentence type (e.g. declarative, optative, imperative, etc., see Chapter 5 for details). As shown in Figure 1, the inflectional
marker may be preceded optionally by three derivational categories.
First level derivation consists of eight suffixes that describe the extent to
which an agent desires or intends to affect some object and the direction and
manner in which an action is performed. Second level derivation consists of
suffixes that have meanings such as 'comitative', 'reciprocal', 'V for someone
other than self, 'V for sake of self, 'causative', 'wish to V', 'V to excess', 'V
habitually or repeatedly', Ύ in the nick of time', 'V ahead or behind expected
time', 'indirect evidence', 'proximal', 'distal', 'action away from speaker',72Chapter 3. Grammatical preview'negative' and 'prospective aspect'. Third level derivation consists of suffixes
that signal other kinds of modality and aspect, such as 'potential', 'non-potential', 'necessity', 'obligation, 'probability', 'intention', 'progressive', 'perfect.'
Details about the ordering and co-occurrence of these derivational markers is
provided in Chapter 7. Meithei verb morphology does not indicate number,
person, gender or pronominal agreement between the verb and its arguments.
There are two derivational prefixes: an attributive prefix which derives adjectives from verbs and a nominalizing prefix which derives nouns from verbs.
(Derivational Root (1st level (2nd level
prefixation)
derivation) derivation)(3rd level
derivation)InflectionFigure 1. Schematic representation of Meithei verb morphology
A noun may be optionally affixed by derivational morphemes indicating
gender, number and quantity. A noun may have one of 5 semantic roles:
agent, actor, patient, recipient/goal, theme. Actor and theme roles are not
indicated morphologically, while all other semantic roles are indicated by an
enclitic. For pragmatic effect, semantic role markers can be omitted or replaced by enclitics which mark contrastiveness or definiteness. Peripheral arguments may be suffixed by enclitics indicating ablative, genitive or associative
case. Finally, a noun may be prefixed by a pronominal prefix which indicates
its possessor. The Meithei noun has the structure given in Figure 2.
(pronominal prefix) Root (Gender) (Number) (Quantifier) (Case)
Figure 2. Schematic representation of Meithei noun morphology
An noun phrase may consist of a noun followed by derivational and inflectional
morphology or of a noun and adjectives, numerals and/or quantifiers. The
order of these constituents within the noun phrase is relatively free.
(2)a. NP -* Ν (Adj*) (Num/Quant)As reflected in phrase structure rule (2a), an noun phrase may consist of either
a numeral or quantifier, but not both. Also, a noun phrase may consist of one
or more than one adjective. P. Madhubala Devi (1979: 157) provides (2b) to
show that up to three adjectives can occur in a noun phrase. Although in
theory this number can be extended ad infinitum, in natural speech it is rare
for more than one adjective to occur in a given noun phrase.","[97, 98]"
"If the Binding theory is valid for languages that exhibit an asymmetry between subject and object position, it follows that in languages that do not exhibit this asymmetry, anaphors and pronominals will not necessarily have the
same structural relationship with their antecedents. Using examples (4f-i), I
will show that this is the case in Meithei.
In Meithei a pronominal may be co-indexed to a noun phrase in the same
clause. In (4f), just as in English, the pronoun mdbu 'him' must be free: it can
either refer to Tomba or have an arbitrary reference but it cannot refer to
Raju.

This restriction, however, can be overcome: if the verbal affix -ca 'V for the
sake of self occurs with the verb of the subordinate clause, then Raju can
serve as the antecedent for the pronoun (see (4g)).

From examples (4a-g), I conclude that in Meithei a pronominal is not necessarily 'free' in its governing category.",[125]
"4.3.3 The adversative marker -pu
The adversative marker, homonymous with the patient marker, signals that the
-pu marked noun phrase is ill-fated in being acted upon or that the verb is
unexpected, unanticipated, or unfortunate. Thus in (24a), if I were expected to118Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structurerow a boat, I could answer that contrary to the requester's information, I did

I assume that -pu is not the patient case marker in (24). Of course, there are
languages where both the case or semantic role and the pragmatic value of an
argument is signalled by the same marker (for example, the Japanese accusative doubles up as an emphatic marker (Bloch 1969: 52)). Although it is
most probably the case in Meithei that the adversative marker -pu is derived
from the patient marker -pu, there are two pieces of evidence that in synchronic grammar these are two distinct homophonous markers. First, adversative pu may be attached to a nonpatient noun phrase as in (24a-d); second, -pu can
occur twice in a noun phrase, once as the patient marker, and once as a pragmatic marker as in (24e).434.3 Information structure( 2 4 ) d . matjondabukananakari119häyganims -ηόη -ts

Similarly, the adversative marker may be attached to peripheral arguments
that are already case marked. Thus in (24f), adversative -pu occurs with the
genitive marker and in (24g) with the associative marker. See section 4.4 for
case marking with peripheral arguments.

be moved to post-verbal position (reminiscent of right dislocation in French,
English and elsewhere, sometimes called an afterthought) in order to reintroduce given information that has not been talked about for a while. This is
illustrated in (25a).

Bhat (1991) states that sentence initial position in Meithei is grammaticalized45 so that if there is no morphological marking to indicate which argument
is actor, the sentence initial argument will be interpreted as actor. This is certainly the preferred interpretation of arguments in sentence initial position (see
(14c) and (23a,b)). The argument in sentence initial position, however, even
when morphological marking is not present to disambiguate the role of the
arguments, does not have to be actor. Thus (25b-d) are ambiguous.

"1.8 Review of literature on the Meithei language
In general the inaccessibility of Northeast India to foreign and Indian scholars
has made the documentation of Tibeto-Burman languages spoken there diffi-12Chapter 1. Introductioncult. This has not been the case with Meithei, about which much has been
written. Existing works can be divided into four categories.
The first is the practical grammars of British missionaries/ administrators, the
most important of which are Primrose (1887, 100 pages) and Pettigrew (1912,
111 pages), who provide useful word lists, conversational sentences and list of
idioms which cannot be found elsewhere. Pettigrew is especially insightful with
regards to the verb morphology. However, neither of these works is exhaustive: much of the affixal morphology is not described, tones are not marked or
described in any detail, textual information is not used, and there is little to no
description of the syntax.
Second, there are a number of pedagogical works on Meithei written in
Meithei or English, and a new grammar comes out almost every year. Since
these are written on the model of Sanskrit grammar, certain grammatical relations such as evidentiality are ignored and other grammatical categories are
postulated where they do not exist. (Subjects are claimed to be marked by
nominative case, for example). These works are useful, however, in that they
provide lists of bound roots, sentences, compounds and the like, as well as
insights into language use. The reader should refer to the References section
for titles and authors of such pedagogical works.
Third, there is the body of literature by native speaking Meithei linguists
which, by 1990, consisted of 27 Master's theses and Ph.D. dissertations. Notable is Thoudam's 1980 Ph.D dissertation which provides a comprehensive
description of Meithei phonology. Sushila Ningthongjam's 1982 Master's thesis
on Meithei morphology includes a near exhaustive list of verbal and nominal
affixes in Meithei with examples. Nongthombam Nonigopal Singh's 1987 Ph.D.
dissertation on Meithei affixal morphology provides appendices with lists of
compounds, roots and examples of words that have from one to ten affixes.
Finally, there is the work of non-Meithei linguists or anthropologists writing
in Hindi and English, such as Grierson from the Linguistic Survey of India
(1903-1928), Hodson (1908) and more recently D.N.S. Bhat and his consultant
and co-author M.S. Ningomba. The work of Bhat and Ningomba (1986a,
1986b) and Bhat (1991) has been the most influential work on Meithei since
Thoudam's (1980) Ph.D. dissertation. The topics covered are word formation,
the case system, tense, and aspect and directionals. Tones are not marked or
described. Some of the data and resulting conclusions are unreliable since
elicited data have been used and results have not been checked with naturally
occurring speech (for more details, see Chapter 4).
During my trips to Manipur, I collected published and unpublished works on
Meithei from the Manipur University Linguistics Department and main library,
from research scholars working on Meithei dialects, and from book stores in
Imphal and Delhi. Works written in Meithei or Hindi were translated with the1.9 Fieldwork13help of native speakers. I have included these works in the References section
of this book.","[37, 38, 39]"
"7.2.2 Derivational morphology
Derivational morphology is not productive in that there are apparently arbitrary restrictions on which suffixes may occur with which nouns. Thus, -lom
'approximate' may be used with human but not nonhuman nouns. Plurals are
indicated with -siy but this suffix cannot occur with pronouns or proper names
(as in English The Flintstones are here which refers to Mrs. Flintstone and her
family).
7.2.2.1 Category 2: Gender
Nouns are not marked for grammatical gender. Semantic gender may be
indicated for animate beings by -pi 'female' and -pa 'male'.80 Thus in (18a)
the stem nu 'human' is suffixed by -pi to indicate a female human and -pa to
indicate a male human. (18b,c) are further examples.
(18) a. nupi
'female human'
b. hanubi 'old woman'
c. phisabi 'female weaver'nupa
'male human'
hznuba 'old man'
phisaba 'male weaver'7.2. The noun morphology245The feminine and masculine suffixes appear in traditional proper names which
are based on adjectives used in naming a child. Thus the eldest male child is
named Tomba and the eldest female child is named Tombi from ton 'top' and
one of the gender suffixes.
Occupational titles of professions traditionally held by men do not have
female equivalents (18d). Where men are the predominant workers in a given
profession, the masculine professional title can refer to male or female workers
in that occupation. Thus (18e-g) may refer to a male or female potter, goldsmith or story teller, respectively. (18h) is a special case in that, although weavers are predominantly female, the occupational title used is the masculine
form.

'books', Θηάηςΐη 'children'). First, second and third person plural pronouns are
signalled with khoy 'this and other like this' (see section 3.3.1.1), which is also
used with human nouns to signify the inclusion of those physically surrounding
or closely associated to the suffixed noun, -ήη cannot be used with pronouns
or proper nouns and khoy cannot be used with nonhuman nouns.81246Chapter 7. Affixal morphology( 1 9 ) b . garisiTombdkhoyginigari

noun Tomba is suffixed by khoy to indicate 'Tomba and his family'; with the
additional suffixation of -lom the construction can be translated as 'Tomba and

Verbs can be derived from nouns with -kum 'similar to, like' (related to faun'like'). In (19j), the verb root tvw- is nominalized with the prefibcation of ms-,

that characteristically occurs with verbs. The verbalizing nature of -kum is
shown in (19k) where it is followed by -p9 'nominalizer' which also characteristically occurs with verbs.","[270, 271, 272, 273]"
"4.4 Case marking on peripheral noun phrases
Noun phrases that are not needed to fulfill the argument structure of a verb
may appear with one of the following case markers: locative -ta, instrumental
-na, associative -ka and ablative -tagi. In this section, I will describe and exemplify these case markers.",[151]
"4.5 Conclusion
In this chapter I have shown that Meithei exhibits a flat phrase structure. The
grammatical status of the arguments that a predicate subcategorizes for is
indicated through semantic role markers which can be manipulated through a
system of pragmatic marking. In the default case the correct interpretation of
the status of arguments in a Meithei sentence can be read off of semantic role
markers and the observance of an animacy hierarchy. Since, however, the
pragmatics can delete and/or replace these markers, interpretation involves a
knowledge of the pragmatic marking system (meaning of overt pragmatic markers, conditions under which semantic role markers can be deleted, word order
and stress). To some extent the pragmatic system makes recovery of grammatical relations difficult so that sentences may often have more than one interpretation. In these cases the larger discourse context must be used to recover
the intended meaning.",[155]

"3.4.2 Postpositions
Two postpositions occur with singular pronouns: -hdk 'at', which indicates an
actor that is near the place of speech and -ijonda 'to' which refers to a goal
that is distant from the speech event or the source of action. The probable
source for ηόη is what DeLancey (1984: 62) calls a locative noun. He notes
that locative nouns often function as dative or locative postpositions; for example, ηαη 'interior' in Tibetan, is used to mean 'inside'. This Tibetan form, natj,
as well as Hayu ηοη 'locative' and Nocte ηαη 'locative, dative/ accusative', are
obviously cognate with Meithei -ijonda, which is most likely a lexicalization of a
locative noun ·ηόη and the locative marker -ta. The origin of -hdk might be
hdk which is a productive stem in Meithei meaning 'body', as in hdkthaij 'confidant' where hdk is compounded with the stem thatj 'near', -hdk or -noqda
may be used with the first person singular pronoun to indicate the amount of
control the speaker has over the action expressed by the verb: when -hdk is
used the speaker is pointing out the inclusion of self in current activity; when
-ijonda is used the speaker indicates that he/she is undergoing some action that
is not under his/her control.",[116]
"98Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structureThese facts are expressed in the theory of Government and Binding (Chomsky 1982: 188) by binding principles which state, in part, that an anaphor must
be bound in its governing category. The term 'anaphor' refers to noun phrases
like himself or each other. We can assume for the point being made here that
the governing category of the pronominal is the minimal clause containing
it.30. In a structure as shown in Figure 1, the subject position is said to ""bind""
the object position because the antecedent and the pronominal are co-indexed
(referentially linked to each other) and because the subject position ""c-commands"" the object position. C-command is defined by van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986: 142) as follows:
C-command: A c-commands Β if and only if the first branching node dominating A also dominates Β and A does not itself dominate B.
IPIVP
VNPi (object)Figure 1. NP(subject) binds the NP(objcct)Significantly, the binding relationship is not symmetric since the subject position c-commands the object position but the object position does not c-command the subject position. So (4a) is grammatical because the anaphor is
bound in its governing category; (4b) is ungrammatical because the anaphor
binds the antecedent not vice versa and (4c) is ungrammatical because there is
no antecedent in the governing category of the anaphor to bind it; that is, the
intended antecedent is too far away.
Consider also (4d) and (4e): (4d) shows that a pronominal noun phrase, in
this case the pronoun him, cannot be coreferential with a noun phrase in the
same clause. In Binding theory this is expressed as the principle that a pronominal must be free in its governing category. Thus (4e) is grammatical whereas (4d) is not since in (4e) the pronominal is not co-indexed with a noun
phrase in the same clause.","[123, 124]"
"4.1.7 Lack of passive
There are certain tests for subjecthood which cannot be carried out in Meithei.
In languages like English, the passive construction singles out the subject for
special treatment: the subject of an active sentence appears as an oblique
argument in the passive counterpart. Since there is no passive construction in
Meithei, this type of singling out of an argument is not available.34 In fact,
the lack of passive in Meithei can be seen as a consequence of the fact that
the semantic roles that a verb subcategorizes for are fixed and cannot be manipulated by the syntax. This is the same conclusion that Kiss (1988: 34) arrives at to explain the lack of passive in Hungarian, which she says, ""is a natural consequence of the fact that the target of nominative assignment is already
fixed ~ on a thematic basis ~ in the lexicon.""",[132]
"102Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structureMeithei also exhibits 'emphatic' reflexives which violate the c-command
constraint since in these constructions the pronouns are free (8b) or have an
antecedent in another clause (8c).

Bhat (1991: 147) uses examples of long-distance reflexives (see his example
147: 114b) and emphatic reflexives (see his example 147: 112a-113) as part of
his argument that Meithei does not have an external argument. I am not sure
how this supports his thesis since the phenomenon of long-distance reflexives
also occurs in languages with subjects (e.g Dutch, German and Russian (Van
Riemsdijk and Williams 1986: 283).
To restate the point being made in this section: languages with a clause
structure similar to English exhibit restrictions concerning pronominals and
anaphors as stated by the Binding theory. Since Meithei does not have the
same clause structure as English, the Binding theory does not make the appropriate predictions for Meithei anaphora.","[127, 128]"
"7.2. Enclitics249Co-occurrence in the mood marker category is restricted to combinations of
the -la 'interrogative' and -o 'solicitive' enclitics.84 The enclitics in the exclusive/inclusive categories may not co-occur.
Some co-occurrence is possible in the attitude marker category, -tie, which
indicates shared information (and so implying accepted or expected information), combines with all attitude markers that are semantically compatible
with it: thus while -ne never co-occurs with the contrary to expectation marker
-ta, the combinations -nehe, -neye and -neko (see (24q,p,t) respectively), are
possible. In the linear order, -ne always occurs before other attitude markers.
-ta 'contrary to expectation' may combine with -ho 'invariant tag' as in (24u).
The remaining attitude markers, -ye 'confirmative', -he 'exasperative' and -ko
'invariant tag', do not combine with each other. Thus the maximum number of
attitude markers attested on a constituent is two.
The occurrence of an attitude marker or a combination of attitude markers
precludes the use of an inclusive/exculsive marker. The attested combination
of inclusive/exclusive markers is restricted to -ta 'exclusive' combining with -mak
'only' as in (23h,i) or with -khak 'to the extent' as in (231).
7.3.1 Determiners, semantic role and case markers
As discussed in section 3.3.1.4, the determiners si 'proximate' and tu 'distal' are
stems that function as enclitics. They exhibit the clitic-like characteristic of
docking at the edge of a phrase.

As represented in phrase structure rule in (11a), sentences may be modified by
adverbial clauses which occur in sentence initial position. Adverbial clauses
are subordinated sentences further suffixed by clausal subordinators (e.g. case
markers or lexical subordinators).

Clausal subordinators are derived from the locative, genitive, associative and
ablative case markers, following a pattern that is common in Tibeto-Burman
languages, as noted by Konow (1909: 9) and discussed in detail for 26 languages of the family in Genetti (1988).

a temporal sequence of events either where the subordinated clause is the first
event and the main clause, the second (as in (12b)) or where both events occur
simultaneously (as in (12c,d)). A cause and effect relationship between the6.3 Adverbial clauses173first and second events is not strongly implied. The V-pdgd sequence is translated as 'when V'.

"4.2 Case marking1074.1.9 Conclusion
Thus arguments of a verb have equal status in Meithei. Evidence for this
claim is that: (1) there are no rules which specifically refer to the verb phrase
constituent, (2) there is no adjacency requirement between the verb and its
arguments, (3) there is no restriction on omission of arguments in complements, (4) arguments in nominalization are not singled out for special case
marking, (5) the semantic role of the understood argument of imperative and
imperative-like sentences is not restricted, and (6) the distribution of pronominals and anaphors shows that Meithei is structurally different from languages
where principles stated in Binding theory are applicable.","[132, 133]"

"7.2 The noun morphology
The noun in Meithei is composed minimally of a root. Suffixal categories are
derivational (gender and number) or inflectional (case). There is a prefixal
category which is non-category changing (possessive prefixes). Markers from
the same category cannot co-occur. Figure 2, a representation of the Meithei
noun, can be derived through the word structure rules in Table 7. Phrase
structure rules for nouns derived from verbs are given in section 6.1.

ROOT/ \ rootIstLDrootFigure 2. The structure of the Meithei noun
Note that the word structure rules for verbs and nouns are identical except
for the category of the word level node, the possible terminal elements of the
derivational and inflectional categories and the lack of third level nominal
derivation.78 The rules in Table 1 and Table 7 can be collapsed so that the
word level node is W for word. The subcategorization frames of affixes will
restrict the rewriting of a particular rule so that only nominal affixes occur with
a noun and verbal affixes occur with a verb root.","[268, 269]"
"503In interrogatives, this marker always occurs with the interrogative enclitic
-la. As seen in (10b), it may also be used independently. In such cases it
is a polite imperative. See Chapter 9 for further discussion of the solicitive marker.
The question words have the following composition, kana 'who' contains
-na, possibly the 'agentive', but it does not mark case any more as
evidenced by the form kanana 'by whom', kdri 'what' contains -ri, the
meaning of which is unknown, kaydaw 'doing what' contains kdri 'what'
and taw 'do'; km becomes kay by a fast speech rule which has been
lexicalized in question words, ksydawqay 'when (exact time/ day)'
contains kdri 'what', taw 'do' and qay 'during'. 'How much, how many' is
ksydm (for mass noun) which contains ydm 'lot' and kaya (for count
nouns), karam 'how, in what way' contains lam 'path, way', karamba
'which' contains lam 'path, way' and -pa 'nominalizer', kaday 'where'
contains -tagi 'ablative' (-tagi becomes tay through a fast speech rule
which in its lexicalized form becomes toy), kamdawna 'how do V' contains
karam 'how', taw 'do' and -na 'instrumental', kamayna 'how' contains
karam 'how' and hay 'say' and -na 'instrumental', kamdaw 'to what extent'
contains karam 'how' and taw 'do', kadomda 'which way' contains som
'side' and -ta 'dative', karigi 'why' is composed of kari 'what' and -ki
'genitive but the expected meaning 'of what, from what or belonging to
what' is not obtained. Possibly, karigi might can be translated as 'from
what (cause)' thereby yielding the meaning of 'why'.
The similarity between the solicitive -o and the inquisitive enclitic -no is
apparent both in a segmental sense and from their meanings: both
contain the segment -o and both soften the communicative force of the
speech act they signal. It is probable that -no is the lexicalized combination of na 'be' and the solicitive marker. In the synchronic grammar
-o affixes to verbs whereas -no affixes to nominal forms.
Ch. Yashawanta Singh (1984: 179) states that kadawijay refers to an exact
time but P. Madhubala Devi (1979: 219) differentiates kadawqay from
karamkanda by stating that the first asks for an approximate time and
that the second asks for a specific time.

"4.3 Informationd . sydi Ramstructure121ηιιηςί'Ram loves me (over all others).' or

Furthermore, ambiguity may arise from the homophony of the contrastive
and agentive markers. For example, since arguments may be freely dropped, it
is unclear if the agent or recipient has been omitted in (25e), so that Tomba
may be the goal or the agent as explained in (i) and (ii).

(i) If -Π9 is the agentive marker the interpretation is: Tomba caused
that book to be carried to the man (through somebody)'.
(ii) If -na is the contrastive marker the interpretation is: '(Someone)
caused the man to carry that book to Tomba (and not anyone else).'
Thus, discourse factors ~ such as the saliency of the first argument - favor
interpretation of the first argument as subject; however, this is not a categorical
rule in Meithei syntax.
The disambiguation of the role of an argument is not a primary concern in
related languages either. In Burmese, marking of arguments follows similar
principles as in Meithei; for example, the semantic role or contrastive value of
a noun phrase determines what marking occurs on it (Johnson 1995, DeLancey
1995). Arguments can occur without any marking, but Johnson notes that the
idea of ""ambiguity avoidance"" is not the primary principle determining the use
or non-use of case markers. Rather, discourse factors like new topic (which
occurs with marking) or continuing topic (which is unmarked) are significant to
optionality of marking. See also Johnson (1992) and Wheatley (1982).","[146, 147]"
"NotesThis form was originally noted in Ch. Yashawanta Singh (1984); however,
when I checked the form with native speakers 2 out of 4 thought the
form was ungrammatical, the other two saying such forms can be found
in poetry or in the stylized language of plays.
Also, nouns do not have a third level of derivation and do have a prefixal
category that verbs do not.
Pettigrew (1912: 14) also lists -sa which he calls vocative case. As seen in
(i) and (ii) -sa additionally acts to pluralize the noun it is suffixed to. It
cannot be suffixed on inanimate nouns: *layriksa; nouns which cannot
substitute for proper names *huysa (hify 'dog'), *misa (mi 'man') or proper nouns *Tombasa.
There are no examples of this marker in my data
and native speakers consider it to be archaic.

"4.2 Case marking
Clauses in Meithei are constructed of a verb and its arguments. I will first describe case marking on the core arguments that a verb subcategorizes for.
Case marking on peripheral arguments is discussed in section 4.4.
As shown in Table 1, a verb may subcategorize for an agent, actor, experiencer/goal, patient, or theme argument. Table 1 also lists the enclitics used to
indicate a semantic role.

•0Predicates fall into classes where members of a class exhibit similar subcategorization frames requiring arguments with the same semantic roles. This
analysis follows the general strategy proposed in Foley and Van Valin
(1984)35 for describing clause structure.
Predicates may be distinguished on the basis of whether they are states or
non-states. State predicates are either equational (be X) or locational (be on
X, be atX), and subcategorize for a theme (10a,b) or an experiencer/goal (10c)
or path (lOd).36108Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structure( 1 0 ) a. ΒηάηΞΪqawreaqaq -si

Activities may refer to unintentional actions (laugh, cry); a motional activity
(dance, fall); or an activity that is under the control of an actor (kiss, hit, give).

"100Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structureThe Binding Theory states that anaphors are bound in their governing category. In Meithei there are three types of data where this is not the case: (1)
an antecedent can precede or follow the anaphor, (2) there are long distance
reflexives, and (3) emphatic reflexives are not bound.
The c-command relationship does not hold between the anaphor and its
antecedent in (5b), (6b) and (7b) since the anaphor occurs before the noun
phrase and it is the anaphor that binds the noun phrase it is co-indexed with.

"88Chapter 3. Grammatical previewTemporal adverbs are frozen compounds. For example, ψ ύ 'today', η3Γαη
'yesterday' and hayeij 'tomorrow' are most likely bimorphemic although the
meaning of the individual roots is not clear. Similarly, although (16a) is not
considered bimorphemic by speakers, it is composed of recognizable Meithei
verb roots.

'pluck, pick' functions as an adverb to indicate 'just, precisely V\ In these
cases, I assume that there are two lexical listings in the actual lexicon for the

The three minor lexical categories of Meithei are quantifiers, numerals and
inteijections. These are considered minor categories because these lexical
items are closed sets which express meanings most often encoded by affixal
morphology.","[113, 114, 115]"
"Speakers recognize a slight semantic difference between postnominal and
prenominal adjectives. Postnominal adjectives are simply descriptive but prenominal adjectives identify the modified noun as belonging to a class of similar
things.59
The similarity between adjectives and relative clauses allows for the ambiguity illustrated in (8d) which can mean 'the shop that sells old books' and has
the structure in (8e); or 'the old shop that sells books' and has the structure in
(δί).60

When two relative clauses refer to the same relativized noun phrase, the clauses can be juxtaposed to indicate that they are conjoined. In this case the
relativized noun phrase appears once in the sentence.",[191]
"7.3 Enclitics
Enclitics are distinguished from other affixes following standard criteria established in the literature. First, whereas affixes subcategorize for lexical categories, clitics subcategorize for phrasal or lexical categories (Klavans 1979, 1983,
1985 and Borjars 1992). Clitics show a low degree of selectivity in that the
category of the host may be lexical or phrasal (Zwicky and Pullum 1983 and
Sadock 1991). Furthermore, clitics exhibit different phonological behavior
from other affixes (Zwicky and Pullum 1983 and Sadock 1991). In Meithei,
most affixes are toneless but clitics are phonologically special since they may be
lexically marked for tone. 83 Also, category 7 clitics do not undergo lexical
phonological rules (for example, -ko 'invariant tag' does not undergo the Voice
assimilation rule). Finally, in the linear order of affixes, enclitics always occur
at the right edge of a word or phrase; they do not interdigitate with inflectional
or derivational morphology (Klavans 1979, 1983, 1985; Zwicky and Pullum
1983, Zwicky 1985, and Sadock 1991).
Enclitics in Meithei fall into six categories: determiners, case markers, the
copula, mood markers, inclusive/exclusive and pragmatic peak markers and
attitude markers. The members of each category are listed in Table 9. The
categories are determined on the basis of position in the word (category 1
occurs before category 2, category 2 before category 3, and so on).",[274]
"145and verbalizedquestion-no
-INQwordsThere are three ways to form a question-word question in Meithei. First, as
shown in (13a), a nominal form of the question word occurs with an inflected
verb. Second, as in (14a,b), the question word occurs in a sentence that ends
with -no 'inquisitive'.54 Questions are marked with -no when the speaker146Chapter 5. Root sentencesTable 2. Question words1.kaday

Three criteria are used to distinguish derivational and inflectional morphology in Meithei. It is argued that inflectional morphology is more productive
than derivational morphology; that in the linear order inflectional morphology
occurs further out from the root than derivational morphology; that the morphophonology of inflectional morphology is more general than that of derivational morphology. Each of these criteria are discussed below.
Inflectional morphology is more productive than derivational morphology.
First, inflectional morphology is ""paradigmatic"", in the sense meant by Aronoff7.1. The verb moTphology203(1976: 2). That is, every Meithei verb exhibits a paradigm with each of the
inflectional markers as illustrated in Table 2.

•keThis is not the case with derivational morphology: as described in the section
7.1.1 to 7.1.3, there are selectional restrictions on the verb roots that derivational morphemes can be affixed to. The characterization of inflectional morphology as productive is correct if we consider the productivity of the category
as a whole. Of course, certain inflectional paradigms may be ""defective"" (Aronoff 1976: 2), so that a particular inflectional morpheme may be unproductive
whereas the category it belongs to is productive. For example, the following
English data evidently argue against productivity as a defining characteristic of
inflection: the inflectional plural suffix -en in oxen is unproductive (does not
occur with all nouns), whereas the derivational agentive suffix -er as in baker is
highly productive. This does not mean that the category of plural is not fully
productive in English. We know that it is, since nearly all singular nouns have
a plural equivalent, but not all verbs can form a noun with -er.
In Meithei, the formal productivity of inflectional morphology is complemented by its semantic productivity: the meanings signalled by the inflectional
morphology are regular, easier to predict than the meanings signalled by the
derivational morphemes which are often idiosyncratic.
It is generally also expected (Greenberg 1966) that derivational morphology
occurs encompassed within inflectional morphology, so that derivational morphology occurs closer to the root than inflectional morphology. Corresponding
to this in Meithei, the three categories which occur closest to the root have
been called derivational, and the fourth category farther out from the root,
inflectional.","[228, 229]"
"104Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structure4.1.6 Subjects in imperative constructions
Typically imperative constructions require a 2nd person actor. Thus in the
English sentence Wash!, a second person actor is the understood subject. The
person of the patient argument, however, is not restricted. In this way, the
subject is given special status with regard to its semantic role and person in
imperative constructions.
In Meithei, a verb with imperative inflection may subcategorize for an actor
argument; in this case the actor must refer to second person. Thus, the actors
in (9e) are possible but the first person actors in (9f) are not.33

a speaker pleads a course of action where the speaker will be participant (best
translated as 'Let us V'); and permissives, where the speaker grants permission
for some 2nd or 3rd person to carry out some action. First, there is no restriction on the person of the actor argument in such constructions. For example,
although supplicatives usually have 1st person plural actors, a 1st person singular actor is also possible when the construction occurs as an embedded indirect question, with the meaning Ί was wondering whether I should V'.

Also, as seen in example (9k), an unspecified second person argument can
be urged to allow some action, which is to be performed in conjunction with
the speaker, to occur. (91) is an example of the permissive construction. In
this instance, the argument that occurs with the verb marked by the permissive
is a theme; however, the required argument of a permissive is not restricted to
a single role. It may be a theme as in (91) or a patient as in (9m).

The possessive pronominal prefix may be affixed to the root sä 'body' to form
pronouns emphasizing that the subject of the verb is a particular person or
thing and no one or nothing else: isdna 'by myself nasdnd 'by yourself and
mssdna 'by him/her/itself. The use of emphatic pronouns is illustrated in the
opposition between (14a) and (14b).

"3.3 Major lexical categories
In this section I will discuss the lexical categories which participate in the
phrase structure described so far. I distinguish between an ""actual"" and a
""potential"" lexicon for Meithei.20 The actual lexicon consists of an unordered
list of underived roots and affixes and lexicalized forms. Each lexical entry in
the actual lexicon consists of specifications about the phonological shape of the
lexical item, what lexical category it belongs to and what its meaning is. On
the other hand, the output of the potential lexicon consists of words created
through productive morphological processes.
In the actual lexicon, roots may be bound (those that must be affixed by
further morphology to be free-standing forms) or free. Nouns and verbs from
the actual lexicon can be distinguished on formal grounds in that bound roots
are verbs and free roots are nouns. They can further be distinguished since
the inflectional and derivational possibilities for each of these classes come
from affixes that belong to mutually exclusive sets (see Chapter 7). In the
potential lexicon, adjectives, adverbs and nominal forms can be derived from
verb roots and stative verbs can be derived from noun roots.",[103]

-hdk is commonly omitted in casual speech styles but is used in the written
language and in more formal speech styles (N. Promodini Devi 1989: 22). The
forms nahdk and mdhdk, rather than the bare pronouns, are considered 'more
polite' probably since they are associated with written and formal speech styles.
According to N. Promodini Devi, it is possible for a speaker to utilize the
choice between a bare pronoun form and a pronoun marked with -hdk, reflecting a semantics for pronouns much like that described for French, German
and Italian in Brown and Gilman (1960). For example, nshdk may be used to
indicate the speaker's respect or social distance with the addressee whereas
η9η may be used to indicate the speaker's disrespect or intimacy with the addressee. This accounts for why -hdk is often described as an honorific or a
marker of respect (Ch. Yashawanta Singh 1984 and P. Madhubala Devi 1979,
among others), however, I do not adopt this analysis since -hdk also occurs
with the first person pronoun.","[116, 117]"
"4.1.4 Pronominal and anaphoric coreference
Consider the English sentences in (4a-c). These sentences show that a certain
structural relationship has to hold between himself and its antecedent. First,
the antecedent must precede the pronoun: (4a) is grammatical whereas (4b) is
not. Second, the pronoun must be ""within reach"" of the antecedent it is referentially linked to. Thus (4a), where the pronoun is in the same clause as its
antecedent, is grammatical but (4c), where the pronoun is in the complement,
is ungrammatical.
(4)a. John knows himself.
b. *Himself John knows.
c. *Johni thinks that Mary knows himself .",[123]
"Much of this analysis is taken from Hodson (1908: 163ff).
With the prefixation of 2-, in stems of the shape CaC where the coda is
[w], the vowel is reduced to [a]. Examples are given in (i-iii).
i.caw-'big'9cawbd'be big'ii.
iii.haw-'taste'
'anger'ahswbd'tasty'
'be angry'saw-dsdwbdThis prefix is most probably cognate to the Garo and Baro kV- prefix
(where the V stands for a variable vowel), which derives adjectives from
intransitive verbs (Burling 1984: 36). khajiktd is probably composed of
this prefix and the root cik 'sever' as seen in (10a).
khitaq has nonaspirated variant fcit^tj.
This is also true for many unrelated languages of the region. See Verma
(1976).
The prefix khu- is no longer productive in Meithei. Recall that the third
person possessive prefix is also ma-. This homophony between the
pronominal prefix and the derivational prefix is also attested in Tibetan
where the prefix 9- has a pronominal use (indicating the third person
pronoun) and a homophonous prefix has a nonpronominal use, since it is
used to derive nominals from verbs. These are considered as derived
from a Proto-Tibeto-Burman third person pronoun (Wolfenden 1929,
Benedict 1972).
See also Chomsky (1982: 211) for a definition of governing category.
(6b) is accepted but characterized as ""poetical"". Some consultants except
(7b) whereas others feel it is ungrammatical with a third person pronoun
and better with a first person pronoun and reflexive.
In my judgement, however, (9b) is grammatical without the complementizer: ' Who did you say went in first?'",[524]
"Unless a relativized noun is marked by the determiner -si or -tu, it gets an
indefinite reading as in (4a,b).

When marked by the distance determiner a relativized human noun is either a
physically or conversationally distant topic as in (4c). Use of the proximate
determiner with the relativized noun phrase to refer to a current topic of conversation or a person visible to the speaker is stylistically marked but possible,
see (4d). The use of the proximate determiner with relativized inanimate
nouns is not stylistically marked.

either semantic or pragmatic marking. Such a restriction, determined by number of and humanness of arguments, cannot be motivated by a grammatical
marking system where one would expect structurally determined rules, but is
well motivated when viewed in terms of interpretation. To facilitate interpretation the pragmatics require a minimum amount of information to differentiate
the status of arguments.
In sentences with causative verbs, non-agent arguments may occur without
semantic role marking but must minimally be marked with pragmatic markers
(26e,f). Agent marking is usually not manipulated by the pragmatic marking
system, and if an agent is not omitted it will occur with its semantic role marker. Sentences like (26g), however, are marignally acceptable if enough context
is provided: in this case, there might be a photo album open with a picture of
the agent being pointed out by the speaker.

"2Chapter 1. IntroductionOn the one hand, Meithei shares many features with Tibeto-Burman languages such as tone, widespread stem homophony, agglutinative verb morphology, verb derivational suffixes originating from the semantic bleaching of verbs,
duplication or elaboration (see Chapter 8), evidentiality and emotional attitudes signalled through sentence final particles, aspect rather than tense marking, lack of gender marking, verb final word order and the lack of grammatical
relations such as ""subject"" and ""object"" (DeLancey 1987, Matisoff 1991b). On
the other hand, Meithei is atypical for the Kamarupan group in some significant ways. It lacks pronominal marking on the verb, which is considered an
original Tibeto-Burman trait (Bauman 1975, DeLancey 1989b),1 and it lacks
numeral classifiers. Also, due to extensive cultural contact with Indo-Aryan
languages, in particular Bengali and Sanskrit, and in recent times Assamese
and Hindi, Meithei contains a large number of borrowed lexical items and
some non-Tibeto-Burman constructions such as the use of question words as
heads of relative clauses.
Meithei is known by different names. The loconym Manipuri, a term derived
on analogy with other place names in India such as Kanpur where -pur is of
Sanskrit origin meaning 'state, place', is used by the Indian government and
non-Meithei Indian scholars. Folk etymologies for Manipur originate from mythology: a snake god Vasuki is said to have thrown out a shining diamond (or
mani, the Sanskrit word for jewel) from its head which filled the land with
natural beauty or jewels. Government-run institutions in Manipur use this
name; for example, Manipur Language Department and All India Radio News in
Manipuri. On ideological grounds many Meithei speakers prefer to use the
glossonym Meitheiron which contains Ion 'language' (N. Promodini Devi 1989a).
In the linguistic literature written by western scholars, the term Meithei (sometimes spelled Meitei) is used. Meithei scholars seem to make a distinction
between whether they are writing in Meithei (when they tend to use the term
Meitheiron) or in English (when they use Meithei). The term Meithei itself
may be a compound of mi 'man' and they· 'separate' (Hodson 1908: 10).
Sohini Ray (p.c.) has pointed out that a current term in use by Meithei
""revivalists"", those who wish to assert Meithei religious, cultural and political
autonomy from India, is Meetei. The origin of this term and its pronunciation
are yet unclear to me.
I have adopted the practice of using the term Meithei to refer to the language of the Meithei since this is what speakers prefer. Also, this avoids confusing the Tibeto-Burman language spoken in Manipur with Bishnupriya Manipuri which is an Indo-Aryan language that was spoken in Manipur between the
13th and 19th century. In the early 1800s Bishnupriya speakers migrated from
Manipur to neighboring Assam, Tripura and Sylhet. Due to the long period of
contact with it, Bishnupriya Manipuri has borrowed many words and some
suffixes from Meithei (Sinha 1974, 1986).","[27, 28]"
"DeLancey's evidence that seeks to establish pronominal marking as an
original Proto-Tibeto-Burman trait is not uncontested (e.g. LaPolla 1992).
This list was compiled from K.S. Singh and Manoharan (1993) and Sen
(1992).
One bittersweet joke in Imphal is that rickshaw drivers in the state are
the most educated in the country. Many speak English and hold Masters
degrees but cannot find better employment.

There is one exception to this rule: ada 'way over there' which is pronounced with emphatic intonation (a lengthening of the vowel accompanied with creaky voice). This form is possibly a lexicalized combination
of the attributive prefix a- (note that an initial a would be ungrammatical
here) and the locative suffix -ta with emphatic intonation.
The contrast of /a/ and /s/ word finally is marginal. A small class of
nouns end in /a/ and contrast with verb plus nominalizer sequences which
end in /Θ/ (piba 'to give' and piba 'clan member') or noun plus case marker which ends in /Θ/ {longa 'kind of bamboo' and longa 'with language').
Since only a vowel can form the nucleus of a Manipuri syllable, in borrowed words a [d] is inserted as the nucleus for words with syllabic nasals
or liquids: philam 'film', tebal 'table'. Presumably, the word for 'film' was
borrowed from an Indo-Aryan language where the insertion of [s] had
already taken place.
Thoudam (1980: 50) attributes such variation to the insertion of a; however, this would not account for the realization of Ν as [r] when a is not
present.
Phonology in α Lab Box is in use at the University of Texas at Austin by
Anthony Woodbury. SoundEdit and Signafyze for the Macintosh were
made available to me through Kerry Green and associate Kathy Fohr of
the Speech Perception Lab at the University of Arizona. I am grateful to
these individuals for giving me access to the hardware and software
necessary for this instrumental study.
These minimal pairs have been noted by Ningthongjam (1982: 33) who
differentiates them by postulating a pause juncture with the subordinating
suffix sequence; however, since a pause is not always present between a
root and a subordinating sequence, the pause juncture hypothesis falls
short of a real explanation about the contrast in these pairs.",[521]
