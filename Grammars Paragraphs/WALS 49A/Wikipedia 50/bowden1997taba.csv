"7.3.1 Pronouns & forms of cross-referencing proclitics

contexts where full noun phrases can be used, except that pronouns cannot
normally be used to refer to inanimates (but see §7.3.1.1 and §6.5 on reflexives
for some exceptions). Pronouns referring to Undergoer arguments (§4.2) mayoptionally cliticise (§3.2) onto the verbs of which they are arguments.
In many languages, possessive pronouns are used to refer to possessors. This
is not the case in Taba, which, strictly speaking has no possessive pronouns.
Rather, possessor nouns and the nouns referring to whatever they possess are
linked by ligatures which are marked for the number and person of the
possessor noun.5 The possessive ligatures used in the Waikyon dialect are
illustrated in figure 7.3.",[235]
"4.3.1 Adpositions
Adpositions are particles which occur as the heads of adpositional phrases
and are used to mark oblique case roles on non-core noun phrases. Taba is
rather unusual in having both prepositions and a postposition. Thepostposition marks nouns as locative while the prepositions mark a variety of
other roles. Adpositions are discussed in more detail in chapter 13, where
reasons for the existence of both prepositions and a postposition are also
explored.",[149]

7.3.1.1 Pronouns and inanimatesAs has just been discussed, the independent pronouns may not generally be
used for inanimate reference. There are two exceptions to this generalisation,
however. Occasionally, ‘higher inanimates’ are accorded more animate-like
status (as in English where things such as cars and ships etc. can be sometimes
ascribed a gender). This is illustrated in in (80).

encountered occasionally. In the Waikyon dialect, nik is clearly most common, but dik is
quite common amongst speakers of some other dialects. Although there are no differencesbetween any of the forms used in Waikyon to distinguish alienable, inalienable or ediblepossessive classes, such distinctions are found in closely related languages such as Sawai
(Jacqui Whisler, n.d.) and Buli (Maan, 1951), and it may be that some of these formaldistinctions signal such possessive classes in other dialects.
7The forms memeu and mmeu are in free variation.",[236]
"6.5 Reflexive constructions
Taba has an invariant reflexive particle do which occurs as an attribute of the
Actor nominal, and which indicates that the Actor of the verb is coreferential
with an Undergoer (either primary or secondary) of the same verb. It is most
commonly encountered with simple transitive verbs where agent and patient
are coreferential.

inanimate reflexive objects. Note that example (75) also shows posses

"Taba, like a great many Austronesian languages, has a large number of roots
which do not in themselves belong to any word class, but which, after having
participated in derivational morphological processes gain membership in a
particular word class. The ‘precategorial root’ is discussed in §4.4.
In Taba, syntactic criteria are the most important for defining parts of speech,
and these will be the characteristics most discussed in the rest of this chapter.
Morphological criteria are of only limited use for determining part of speech
membership. Semantic criteria are not used at all to assign individual words to
word classes, but they are used to ascribe an appropriate label to already
defined word classes on the basis of cross-linguistic semantic similarities. (See
Dixon, 1977 and Schachter, 1985 for general discussions on the determination of
parts of speech categories.)114TabaThe same forms may sometimes function on different occasions as differentparts of speech, without any overt morphological marking. In (1) mlongan ‘be
long’ functions as a verb, but in (2) it functions as a noun ‘depth’.

metresSometimes, the meanings of etymologically related nouns and verbs having
the same form cannot be predicted from each other. For example, the verb poas
‘to row’ is related to the noun poas ‘oar’.
In a few cases the form of a word can be used to incontrovertibly define its
word class, but this is rare. For example taktek ‘scoop (n.)’ is derived from the
verb tek ‘to scoop’. The instrumental reduplicative prefix tak- (see §7.1.2.1)
marks taktek as a noun.","[133, 134]"
"5.3Nominal clausesNominal clauses take a diverse range of forms. Depending on the nominal
subcategories to which both arguments and predicates belong, a number of
different semantic functions can be discerned for nominal clauses. In §5.3.1 we
discuss some of the formal characteristics of nominal clauses and in §5.3.2 aclassification of nominal clauses according to the kinds of meanings they
express is provided.
5.3.1 Formal characteristicsNominal clauses consist of just a noun phrase in the case of existence clauses
(see §5.3.2.6), but more commonly (in all other kinds of nominal clauses) of bothan argument noun phrase (which may nevertheless be ellipsed) and a noun
phrase acting as predicator. Given that both the argument and the predicator in
these nominal clauses are noun phrases, the first problem which needs to beaddressed in this discussion is how we can determine which noun phrase bears
which function.
A number of pragmatic properties of arguments as they are used in discourse
can be used to identify the arguments in nominal clauses. These all have to do
with the fact that arguments are trackable in discourse. Trackable elements in
discourse often tend to be given information (once they have been introduced
into a discourse), and they are referential. This cluster of pragmatic properties
typically associated with arguments often has grammatical consequences:
arguments are often definite (e.g. they are proper nouns, or they are qualified
by demonstrative particles, etc.) while predicator noun phrases are hardly everTaba146definite.","[165, 166]"
"Another problem with the traditional approach to grammar writingis that languages often include minor form-classes which can have a role to play
at different structural levels within a language. This is the case, for example,20Tabawith the class of ‘directionals’ which have been identified in Taba. Some of the
forms which have been derived from directional roots are formally classified as
nouns while others can function as verbs or as adverbials of various kinds.
Should they all be treated separately, in order to satisfy the constraints of the
structural divisions of the grammar, or should they be treated together, in order
to show both their formal and functional commonalities?
Inevitably, the answers to such questions as those posed above will involve
compromises on the part of the linguist who is writing a grammar. This
grammar, like any other can be viewed as the end product of a large number of
such compromises. While the basic outline of this grammar follows the
progression of the ‘standard grammar’ from small units of analysis such as thephoneme through larger units of analysis such as the clause and multi-clausal
constructions, a few departures from this ‘standard’ framework have beenmade where it was felt that such departures contribute to a better
understanding of the Taba language in some way.
The first departure from this standard framework lies in the provision of
some chapters where we ‘zoom out’ to take in a wider view of the language’s
structures before zooming back in on smaller structural units. This occurs, forexample, with chapters 5 and 6 which provide an overview of simple clauses
before any examination of either the noun phrase (chapter 7) or the verb phrase
(chapter 8).","[39, 40]"
"These have arisen from roots to which the stative deriving prefix *ma- was once
attached and to which post-nasal syncope has subsequently applied. In modern
Taba, although the sequence ma- or m- commonly occurs at the beginning ofUndergoer intransitives, the prefix is no longer truely productive (but see
§8.5.2). A few examples of such forms are given in (39).
(42)mbtiluk‘berotten’<*ma-+PAN*buRukmit‘be soft’<*ma-+PEMP*lutmunihis‘be thin’< *ma-+PAN*nipisSuch morphological and phonological processes explain the vast majority of
initial consonant clusters, but do not yet provide an account for the origins of
initial geminates. Although the specific processes which have applied in each
and every case for the emergence of initial geminates are not clear, there is one
process which may have played a prominent role.
In instrumental reduplication (§2.7.6.2 & §7.1.2.1), a copy of the initial CVCsequence of a verb root is made, the vowel is changed to /a/ and the resulting
affix is prefixed to the root to derive a noun referring to an instrument. A
similar process has been reported in a number of languages from Maluku
including Sawai (R. Whisler, 1992: 26-28), Buli (Maan, 1951: 25-26) and West62TabaTarangan (Nivens 1993). It appears that the process is of some antiquity (see
Blust, forthcoming).
In many instances of instrumental reduplication in Taba, the final consonantof the reduplicative prefix assimilates to the initial consonant of the root (see
§2.7.6.2 for more details). In one certain case, the assimilated form has beenfurther weakened in some speakers’ idiolects so that the prefix has been
reduced right down to a copy of the first consonant:
(43)doéba ‘garden’with reduplicative prefix:dabdéba‘earth’with assimilation:daddéba‘earth’some speakers:ddéba‘earth’The vast majority of contemporary roots with initial geminates are nouns, so
it may well be that other initial geminates have also derived from reduced
reduplicative prefixes. However, the evidence is limited at this stage andfurther historical research needs to be done to properly understand the origins
of initial geminates.","[81, 82]"

number of respects. While genitive - noun order is the only pattern for which
Taba consistently fails to meet expectations (and according to Dryer, genitive -noun order is relatively weakly correlated with Verb - Object order, particularly
in SVO languages), Taba has variable ordering in two more cases. TheseOverview of clausal syntax167concern the order of adpositions and nouns, as well as the order of contentverbs and tense / aspect verbs.
As far as genitive - noun order and adposition - noun order are concerned,
Taba probably exhibits the patterns as a result of extensive contact with
typically AOV non-Austronesian languages also found in North Maluku.","[186, 187]"
"The heads of noun phrases are always nouns. They may be qualified in a
variety of ways. These include postposed demonstrative particles, measureParts of speech115phrases or relative clauses as well as attributive nouns. Number is usually only
marked on nouns having human referents (chapter 7). Four minor
subcategories of nouns are distinguished: pronouns (§4.1.1), locatives (§4.1.2),
quantifiers (§4.1.3) and interrogatives (§4.1.4). Most nouns, however, belong tonone of these subcategories.
Nouns are shown occurring in a variety of syntactic roles in (3) through (7).","[134, 135]"

"214Taba7.3 Pronouns, person & number
The major purpose of this section is to provide a discussion of the nominal
grammatical categories of Person and Number, and the representation of these
categories. Person is marked on pronouns and on the cross-referencing
proclitics attached to verb phrases. Number is marked on NP’s and pronouns.

The final type of predication found in Taba is the adpositional clause. It has a

in the corpus. A simple adpositional clause is illustrated in (66).

than any of the prepositions. As discussed in chapter 13, li licenses non-locative
noun phrases to occur in syntactic positions normally reserved for locativenouns. This being the case, adpositional clauses are closely related to nominal
locative clauses (§5.3.2.3).","[172, 173]"

are polysyllabic.)The reasons for the existence of the -ik applicative form are probably at least partly historical.

Actors, primary Undergoers, and secondary UndergoersThe facts as presented so far would suggest that the grammatical relation
‘subject’, as usually used to refer to a unified category represented by A and S
arguments, does not have any relevance to Taba, at least as far as the overt
coding properties of arguments are concerned. The problem is that there is no
real coherence within any S category in Taba. Sa and So have quite distinct
properties. Sa aligns with A in its overt coding properties while So aligns most
clearly with the arguments of non-verbal predicates, and with the firstappearing arguments of bivalent intransitives. In fact, So shares more
properties in common with transitive O and with the first Undergoer argument
of ditransitives: none of these are cross-referenced on verbs, and all pronominalOverview of clausal syntax185arguments of these sorts occur immediately postverbally. It is only in the case
where they are represented by full NPs that there is any difference in their
behaviour. All of this, then, suggests that Actor and Undergoer are the
grammatical relations most pertinent to describing Taba morphosyntax, at least
at the level of overt coding.
This characterisation of syntactic roles in Taba does not yet address the issue
of how to distinguish between the different Undergoer arguments in clauses
which have more than one of them. There are two kinds of constructions in
which two Undergoers are found: bivalent intransitives and ditransitives. Itappears that in each of these construction types one of the twin Undergoers
does indeed have more pragmatic salience than the other. In bivalentintransitives, the patient or the figure (depending on how the verb was derived)
occurs preverbally if manifested by a full NP while full NP instruments and
grounds occur postverbally. While pronominal patients and figures occur
postverbally, they still precede any overt instrument or ground arguments,
whether pronominal or not. Moreover, instrument and ground arguments in
these constructions may be marked adpositionally while the other arguments
may not. All this suggests that the initially occuring Undergoer might be
labelled the ‘primary Undergoer’ while the finally occurring one might be
labelled ‘secondary Undergoer’. While neither of the Undergoer arguments of
transfer ditransitives may be marked adpositionally, word-order considerations
suggest that the recipient should align with the patient of an instrumental
ditransitive as ‘primary Undergoer’ and the theme should align with the
instrument of in the instrumental ditransitive verbs as ‘secondary Undergoer’.
These Taba grammatical relations, tentatively ascribed on the basis of overt
coding properties, are summarised in figure 6.7.","[203, 204, 205]"

REALThe similarity between the forms of the suffixes illustrated above and the
forms of the independent pronouns (§7.3) is readily apparent. The excretory
verbs also closely resemble reflexive constructions (§6.5) in their form. There
are, however, some important differences between excretory verbs andreflexives. In reflexive constructions, Undergoer pronouns are optionally, but
not necessarily, cliticised onto their verbs. With excretory verbs, on the other
hand, the postposed cross-referencing markers are true suffixes, always
occurring as part of the same phonological word as the verb root. The forms of
the 2sg., 1pl.excl., and (sometimes) the 1sg. suffixes are also phonologically
reduced in comparison with their reflexive Undergoer counterparts. While
quite probably having arisen historically from reflexive constructions, the
contemporary Taba excretory verbs are clearly formally distinct from thecontemporary reflexives.
So-called ‘double agreement’ has been reported in other Austronesian
languages such as Kokota in the Solomon islands (Palmer, 1995). Palmer
suggests that the verbs involved in double agreement in Kokota (expressing227Verb morphology and valenceconcepts such as ‘hiccup’, ‘yawn’, ‘be angry’, ‘be pleased’) are doubly crossreferenced because the referents of these arguments are subject to forces over
which they have no direct control. Although Kokota is typologically quite
different to Taba, (it is otherwise an accusative language rather than a split-S
language), much the same case can be made for the sole arguments of the Taba
excretory verbs discussed here. Excretion is typically something that people are
forced to do rather than something which they have any real degree of control
over.
A detailed discussion of the characteristics of derived excretory verbs is givenwhere each of the valence-affecting derivational affixes is treated. In the
constructions which utilise these derived forms, further evidence for thetreatment of the excretor as at the same time both Actor-like and Undergoer-like
can be seen. See §8.3.2.5, §8.3.3.5, §8.4.4 for details of derivational processes
concerning verbs of excretion.","[245, 246, 247]"
"The kinds of arguments that Dixon is referring to here as ‘subjects’ are
arguments that in some sense have greater ‘syntactic weight’ than other
arguments. While such a category might not be immediately obvious if we look
solely at overt phenomena such as word-order or case-marking, a unitary
‘subject’ category may be revealed at a deeper level of analysis, in that only
subjects may be able to control syntactic phenomena such as relativisation, or
equi-NP deletion, etc.",[198]
"Morphological & syntactic units109The most common proclitics are the agent cross-referencing verbal proclitics
which occur prefixed to verb phrases. The most common enclitic is the plural
marker =si.
The cross-referencing proclitics are most commonly simply prefixed to verbs
as in (29), but if any other elements of the verb phrase occur in front of the verb
itself, the cross-referencing proclitics are attached to these, as illustrated in (30)
where the proclitic is prefixed to the reciprocal particle maka.

The proclitic ha= is one such classifier. In (32) ha is the phonological
dependent of wal ‘eight’ but the head of the whole phrase hawal pa sio.

Compounding occurs when two words, neither of which is a clitic, fuse
together phonologically to create a new form which now behaves as a singleTaba110phonological word. Compounds are words in which the combined form is
recognisable as an independent semantic unit itself. Such compound forms
often have lexicalised meanings. Compounding results in the creation of a new
word, both phonological, and morphological, from what were once two
independent words.
(33)ntonololann-tono-lolan
3sg-look.at-path/road
‘lizard’Cliticisation results in the loss of some degree of phonological substance for
one or other of the cliticised forms. In cliticisation, it is generally the firstelement which loses in phonological substance, as illustrated in (34) below
where the final syllable of mawowo ‘light’ has been lost, and stress reassignment
has taken place after it has been cliticised to appo ‘to downwards’ (the resulting
form mawoappo has the lexicalised meaning ‘the next day’).

formation of a single new phonological word from what was once two
phonological words, but the resulting single phonological word in this case is
composed of two morphological words. In this kind of cliticisation, thepronouns lose stress, and behave phonologically as if affixes to the verbs. They
thus lose their status as independent phonological words, but still behave as if
independent morphological units. This is an optional process, presumablyconditioned by discourse factors that are not well understood (but see §9.3.1).
In (35) we see the Undergoer pronoun i ‘3sg’ occurring as a stress attractingMorphological & syntactic units111independent word. In (34) it has lost stress, and appears as an enclitic,

"218Taba7.3.3 NumberTaba makes a distinction in grammatical Number between singular and
plural categories. In the Waikyon dialect, contrastive plural is only marked for
humans, although in Samsuma, other animates may also be marked forplurality. For humans, plural marking is obligatory, and is used for all noun
phrases that refer to more than one individual. It is also used as an indicator of
respect in both the second and third persons when addressing or referring to an
individual of greater age than the speaker.?
Number is marked on both pronouns, on cross-referencing proclitics, and onall noun phrases. For normal noun phrases, Number is marked by the phraselevel enclitic =si, as illustrated in (82) and (83) below. In (82) the enclitic =s1
indicates that there is more than one child playing on the beach, while in (83)the enclitic shows that the entire noun phrase mama lo baba ‘mother and father’
is plural.

been felt worthwhile to include a morphemic representation distinct from the
phonemic one given first to make it easier to see the underlying structure of
forms such as those including ‘metathesised’ applicatives (see §2.7.4). The third
line consists of a gloss of each morpheme and the final line is a free translation.

"R.M.W. Dixon has published a number of works dealing with the nature of
the obligatory arguments that co-occur with intransitive and transitive
predicates in the languages of the world. In Dixon (1994:6-7), he says that:
all languages work in terms of three primitive relations:S — intransitive subject
A — transitive subject
O - transitive objectIn languages with a nominative - accusative grammar, S and A
naturally group together. Languages of the ergative - absolutive type
link S and O. Many languages have some accusative and some ergative
characteristics, linking S with A for certain purposes and S with O for
other purposes. For any discussion of universal grammar, it is most
useful to take S,A and O as the basic grammatical relations, and todefine ‘subject’... in terms of them.",[175]
"219Nouns & noun phrasesIt has been observed that many adults use deictic shifts towards the
perspective of children whom they are addressing in their use of plural
marking. For instance, utterances such as the one exemplified in (85) are
commonly heard spoken by people older than those they are referring to,
presumably in order to show that respect should be accorded to the referent by
the addressee.

Verb morphology and valenceThis chapter deals with the verb and the various affixes which can be
attached to it. Defining characteristics of the major subcategories of verbs were
given in detail in §4.2, and a detailed justification for the absence of any
adjective word class distinct from that of verbs was given in §4.2.1.","[238, 239, 240, 241]"
"The first part of this chapter discusses the noun itself, and derivational
processes which can be used to create nouns. The second part of the chapter
discusses the structure of the noun phrase. In the final section of the chapter the
nominal grammatical categories of number and person will be discussed, as will
pronouns.",[215]
"Taba2348.3.1.7 Some semantic entailments of causative morphologyIn many languages, the use of causative morphology entails that the subject
of the derived clause is a volitional actor who intended to bring about a certain
result. This is not strictly the case in Taba, where it can be explicitly signalled
that the result of the process was not intended, even though causativemorphology is used. (This feature of Taba semantics is in keeping with the
general functions of Actor intransitive verbs in Taba.)

‘He caused the coconut to be accidentally shredded.’This utterance is acceptable, though, if someone drops a coconut from a tree
and accidentally splits it open. Here, ta- (see §8.4) indicates the accidental
nature of the splitting, and emphasises the resultant shredded state of the
coconut. The causative prefix ha- indicates that someone has done something
that accidentally brought about the resultant state of the coconut. The example
shown in (42) is similar: the Actor of (41) is rain (something which could nothave deliberately brought about the resultant damaged state of the road).

-Vk suffixation performs a variety of functions, each of which will bediscussed in the following sections:© it derives ‘bivalent intransitive’ verbs from Undergoer intransitives
e it derives transitive verbs from Actor intransitives
* it derives ditransitive verbs from transitive verbs
e it can act as an ‘intensive’ markerThe use of -Vk with verbs of excretion is discussed separately in §8.3.2.5. The
exact details on what kinds of semantic roles are associated with the arguments
licensed by this applicative suffix are sometimes obscure, depending on the
semantics of the verb to which they are suffixed (and also, ocassionally,
contextual pragmatic features). Most commonly, the -Vk suffix allows an extra
instrument to be included as a core argument in the clause. Examples of -Vk
suffixation that allow extra themes, patients, companions and recipients are also
encountered. In some cases the meanings of the derived forms involved have
become lexicalised.
The -Vk applicative suffix occurs before the -o applicative in the only attested
example of a derived form having both suffixes. The -Vk suffix has thus been
labelled the ‘internal’ applicative. The relevant example is discussed in §8.3.3.4.","[253, 254, 255]"
"Introduction1.4.4 Multilingualism:27language contact and decline of TabaVirtually all adult Taba speakers are also fluent in the regional lingua franca
of North Moluccan Malay. North Moluccan Malay and Bahasa Indonesia are
two varieties of the same lingua franca which are in a diglossic relationship in
North Maluku? Most village-dwelling Taba speakers have limited command of
the ‘high’ variety of Bahasa Indonesia (which they themselves often refer to as
Bahasa Indonesia Tinggi ‘High Indonesian’) as opposed to Bahasa Malayu
‘Malay’, the ‘low’ variety which is the one making the most impact on Taba.
Those Taba speakers with higher levels of education generally speak ‘official’
Indonesian better than those with less education.
Quite a few Makian Luar speaking inhabitants of the western side of Makianisland speak Taba, but hardly any Taba speakers know the western language
language, most saying that it is too difficult to learn.
Although few Makianese today speak other minority languages from North
Maluku, this clearly has not been the case throughout history. For many years
Ternatan functioned as a regional lingua franca, and many Ternatan loan words
can be found in contemporary Taba. Loans from a wide variety of source
languages are found in Taba, including a few words from European languages
such as Dutch which appear to have been borrowed directly into Taba. For
example, I have been unable to find any other languages in the region with
forms similar to Taba bonci for peanut’ (< Dutch boontje ‘little bean’). The other
regional languages I am aware of have borrowed Malay kacang. A number of
similar forms are also found.
Today, Taba is being increasingly affected by Malay. Better communications
and increased education mean an ever-increasing role for Malay in everyday
life and corresponding decrease in the role for Taba. Although Taba is still the
preferred language for household use, more formal situations generally call for
the use of Malay, even if all of the audience present are speakers of Taba. This
seems to be a fairly recently introduced feature of Taba life. Although the
present kepala desa in Waikyon, Ahmad Hamaya always speaks Malay on public
occasions, I was told that his predecessor always spoke Taba when only Taba
speakers were present. The only person I ever heard speaking Taba during a2See Ferguson (1957) for an introduction to the notion of diglossia.","[46, 47]"

coconutOne further point should be made with regard to bivalent intransitive
derivation. Although with many of the uses of applicative morphology to bediscussed below it is possible to substitute adpositional expressions for
applicative suffixes as markers of extra arguments, this is not possible in the
case of bivalent intransitive derivation with -Vk. The putative counterpart of
(50) seen in (52), for example, is grammatical, but has a quite different meaning
from (52). This difference in meaning stems from the heterosemy? of ada, which,in addition to its role as an instrument marking preposition also occurs as a2‘Heterosemy’ is a term borrowed from Lichtenberk (1991) which refers to the related sensesof lexemes (much like polysemy) except that the lexemes may have different word class
memberships which have presumably come about through some kind of grammaticalisation
process.",[257]
"In Taba, it sometimes occurs in serial verb constructions(§12.2.4) and sometimes occurs as a preposition (§13.2.4). As pointed out above,instruments also appear in Taba as applied core arguments of verbs. Pake
appears to be a relatively recent borrowing into Taba since older speakers of the

“Nyong is cracking nuts for John.’It should be noted that this is the only example in the whole corpus where
the applicative licenses a beneficiary. It is also the only example of anything
other than untuk licensing an argument that can be simply labelled as
beneficiary. Note that in the resultative construction illustrated in (62) the exactnature of the benefit received by wangsi ‘the children’ has been specified, i.e.
that they received the books. The noun phrase is thus realised as an actual
recipient of something rather than as a beneficiary. (See §13.2.3 for more
discussion of the seeming unimportance of beneficiaries in Taba.)
The final Taba preposition is the similative marker lo glossed ‘SIM’ and
generally translated into English as ‘as’. This always occurs as a complement of
the Undergoer intransitive verb sama ‘be the same’. Its origins are not known
with any certainty but it is noteworthy that it has the same form as the
conjunction lo ‘and’ (§4.3.2). It is illustrated in (64) and discussed at more lengthin §13.2.2.

Lyons have been framed in. This chapter began with a quote from Dixon
(1994:6-7) explaining three primitive relations (S, A, and O) that have so far been
used to elucidate principles of word-order, etc. in this chapter. We noted that
the definitions provided by Dixon for S, A and O were problematic. He defines
S as the intransitive subject, and A as the transitive subject without at firstgiving a definition of subject. Likewise he defines O as the transitive object
without first stating what a transitive object is. We circumvented that problem
for Taba by redefining S as simply the sole obligatory argument of an
intransitive verb, A as the argument cross-referenced on a transitive verb, and Oas the argument not cross-referenced on a transitive verb. Dixon went on to saythat

In this section we examine the morphophonemic processes associated withVk applicative derivation in Taba. A description of the functions of the-Vk
applicative is found in §8.3.2. The -Vk prefix takes a variety of forms depending
on the root to which it is attached: each of these will be discussed in turn below.
Some of the processes to be discussed in this section would appear at first
glance to involve metathesis. I will argue that there is no real metathesis in
Taba, but that the final result of applying several different morphophonemic
rules merely looks like metathesis.
The root structures which condition different forms of the suffix are:¢ words with stressed final syllables
¢ polysyllables with unstressed open final syllables
¢ polysyllables with unstressed closed final syllables
Each of these root structures, and the appropriate forms for the applicative
suffix will be discussed in turn below.
2.7.4.1 Stems with stressed final syllablesThe most common form of the -Vk applicative is -ak, but other forms are also
possible. A preliminary illustration of -ak suffixation is given in (91).

"Taba1304.3.1.1 Prepositionscase,
Taba has four prepositions: ada which marks comitative or instrumental
iaries, and lo, a
pake which marks instrumental case, untuk which marks beneficthe
similative marker. All of these are probably recent innovations in Taba, and
meanings of all of them can also be expressed by other means.
The comitative / instrumental preposition ada (§13.2.1) is derived historically
from the conjunction ada ‘with’ / ‘and’. Companions and instruments can also
occur as the core arguments of verbs, subcategorised for by applicative
marking. The use of ada as a preposition is shown in (59).

"192Taba6.6 Reciprocal constructions
Reciprocal constructions indicate that the referents of referentially pluralnoun phrases act on each other at the same time in some way. The reciprocal
particle maka occurs preposed to the verb it marks as reciprocal, and any Actorcross-referencing proclitics are prefixed to maka. In Taba reciprocal
constructions, a variety of different argument types can be involved.

Nouns and noun phrasesThis chapter is concerned with both Taba nouns and the general structure of
the Taba noun phrase. Nouns are defined as a part of speech in §4.1, but more
details on the derivation of nouns from other categories are given here. While
all major aspects of the noun phrase will be mentioned in this chapter, a number
of topics relevant to noun phrases will be treated in more detail elsewhere.
Possession, for example, is discussed in chapter 9 and quantification is treated
in chapter 10. Directionals, which can be used to modify both nouns and verbs
are discussed in chapter 11. Relative clauses are treated in §16.4.","[211, 212, 213, 214, 215]"
"Taba2047.2 The noun phrase
This section provides a discussion of the structure and functions of the noun
phrase in Taba. Some kinds of noun phrases, and some of the potentialelements of the noun phrase will receive a detailed treatment in this chapter,
but others (generally those which also have a role to play in structures other
than noun phrases) will only be outlined here and treated in more detailelsewhere.
Noun phrases generally have a noun as their head, but sometimes the head
noun may be ellipsed when the only overt elements of the noun phrase may be
modifiers. All nominal modifiers except for possessors follow the head noun in
a Taba noun phrase.","[223, 224]"
"As mentioned above, dependent locatives occasionally occur without any
independent head. The conditions for this are not fully understood at present,
but in every case where this usage has been noted, it can be assumed that an
independent directional is anaphorically, or cataphorically retrievable by theaddressee.

some way as the head of the construction. In (29), the possessor triggers

‘The top of the black thong is white’.(34a) is an adnominal possessive clause. Here, bulang ‘white’ is a relative
clause which modifies the Undergoer of the clause liko ‘skin’. (34b) is an
Undergoer intransitive clause with the Undergoer intransitive predicate bulang
‘be white’. Here the argument is sandal kuda ni liko ‘the top of the black thong’.
In this case kuda ‘be.black’ is a relative clause which modifies the possessor
noun sandal ‘thong’.","[289, 290, 291]"
"8.4.2 Non-volitionality
When prefixed to an Actor intransitive stem, the derived form is anUndergoer intransitive verb. I have so far only heard one spontaneous
utterance where ta- is used with this function, but I have also elicited a fewfurther examples. All of those which have been collected are intransitive verbs
of motion which have an animate Actor in their underived forms. The
argument of the Actor intransitive form is not deleted in this case, but rather it
appears as Undergoer of the derived Undergoer intransitive verb. The major
difference in meaning is that whereas the underived Actor is generally seen asa
volitional actor with a purpose in mind, the derived Undergoer is not seen as
having any particular purpose. The spontaneously uttered example of ta- with
this function is shown in (116).

prefixed to other intransitive verbs of motion, with a similar meaning.",[274]
"4.2.1 ‘Undergoer verbs’ or adjectives?
In this grammar, I distinguish no class of adjectives. There is however a
group of Undergoer verbs which often have the kinds of meanings that are
associated with adjectives in other languages. In this section I will present my
reasons for characterising this class as Undergoer verbs rather than adjectives.
As pointed out by various writers, e.g. Dixon (1977), Schachter (1985), majorparts of speech are usually defined on the basis of a whole range of different
characteristics in morphology, semantics and syntax. In Taba, Actor and
Undergoer verbs may be distinguished on the basis that Actor verbs bear
prefixes which cross-reference an Actor argument while Undergoer verbs do
not. However, this is the only major piece of evidence which can be used to
distinguish them, and they share many properties in common: there are nogrounds for setting these up as two major parts of speech.
In the following section I will review some of the kinds of evidence we might
expect to see if adjectives and verbs were distinct categories in Taba and show
that such evidence is lacking.",[143]

Friederici, 1914) were quick to notice that this pattern of a ‘reversed genitive’ isprevalent in the region, and proposed that the languages of eastern Indonesia
with the reversed genitive pattern formed a distinct subgroup of Austronesian.
More recent commentators (e.g. Blust, 1978, 1983/83, 1984, 1993; Grimes, 1991and others) generally discount the value of this word order pattern for
subgrouping. See §6.1 for more discussion of word-order in Taba.","[225, 226]"

"6.3.1 Preposed NP intonation units
Quite a large number of utterances are encountered in Taba discourse wherenoun phrases occur alone as intonation units, most commonly preceding a
clause with which they appear to be associated. The elements found here
attract contrastive emphasis by virtue of their prominent position relative to the
clause itself. The major function of this construction in Taba is to name
something which provides an orientational framework for what follows it.
Whatever follows this element is then interpreted with respect to the orientation
it provides.6 Often, the fronted NP is coreferential with one of the arguments of
the following clause, but this need not always be the case.",[190]
"8.3 Valence increasing morphology
There are three derivational affixes which can be used for increasing valence:
the causative prefix ha- and two applicative suffixes -Vk and -o. They are all
quite productive, although in some cases particular combinations have become
lexicalised, as with the causativised forms of hani ‘have’ discussed above.",[247]
"Morphological & syntactic units1053.1.2 ParticlesParticles are phonologically independent forms which have little
morphosyntactic independence. They are defined as morphological units that
are stress-bearing but which can never occur as free forms. Particles can occurwithin verb phrases, noun phrases, adpositional phrases, or as conjunctions.
The adnominal possessive markers (§9.1) are also treated as particles.
3.1.2.1 Verb phrase particlesThe verb phrase particles are the aspect / modality markers do (realis mood,
§14.1.1) and hu (continuative aspect, §14.1.2), and the reciprocal particle maka(see §6.6). These must always occur along with a predicator of some kind.
The preposed particle maka must always immediately precede the verbs
which it qualifies.
