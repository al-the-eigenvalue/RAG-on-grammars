"Sentence (226) shows that the X position can be filled by the determiner of the definite
object. The pronoun nu ‘3S’ is the resumptive pronoun of the topicalized subject iina

complete definite object phrase with the postverbal noun pápaaja ‘fish.’ It is
ungrammatical if the entire definite object noun phrase appears in the X position, as in

The ILDP has adopted the following orthography (i.e. phonemic6) for the Iquito
language. In the following, I introduce first the consonants and then the vowels; the
graphemes can be written in both upper and lower case. I also include the corresponding
IPA symbols between square brackets.",[31]
"442.3.1 Basic Word Order
This section discusses and defines the basic word order of Iquito. The discussion
of basic word order here concerns only the surface word order. It does not deal with
theoretical assumptions concerning the underlying word order from which the surface
word order is derived. The study of basic word order is based on the assumption that
there is always one basic word order in all languages which is syntactically defined by
the relative order among principal constituents. This assumption generally stands except
in the case where the word order of the language is free, is pragmatically constrained or
defined rather than syntactically based, or the appearance of both constituents (i.e.
grammatical subject and object) in a clause is rare, in which case, defining any basic
word order for such languages could be forced to some extent. However, as Mithun
(1987) points out, “for languages with relatively rigid, syntactically defined surface word
order, the establishment of this order at the outset has obvious utility. The description of
rarer, morphologically and pragmatically marked alternative orders as the result of the
movement of constituents out of their normal position is mechanically simple.” The basic
word order of a language refers to the relative order among principal constituents in one
clause. The principal constituents of a transitive clause include subject, verb and object.
Many languages, although not allowing free word order, allow more than one possible
word order. In Iquito, this is also the case. However, a sentence with basic word order is
characterized as being least specific and least marked, morphologically as well as
pragmatically, and although frequency of use is not a necessary part of the definition of
basic word order, in Iquito the most common word order is in fact the basic word order.
This section considers transitive and non-topicalized sentences. Lai (2006) includes
examples of all possible variants which might influence, crosslinguistically, the
placement of nominal phrases, including animacy, definiteness and the weight of the
45phrase, e.g. full phrases vs. pronouns. I argue that the basic word order in Iquito is SVO
instead of SOV and that animacy, definiteness and the phrase weight play no role in
deciding the basic word order for Iquito. The following is a table to illustrate all wordorder variations in a finite clause with one lexical verb.","[62, 63, 64]"
"77 Many Indo-European languages (i.e. Modern Greek and English, among others) and other non-Indo-European languages (i.e. Papago, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew, Turkish, and Basque, among others) have
fake tense and aspect morphology in CF conditionals and wishes (Iatridou, 2000: 245).

morphemes.",[200]
"1.2.4 Features of Local Spanish as Phenomena of Language Contact
Local Spanish in the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu displays striking
differences from the regular Latin American Spanish and Regional Amazonian Spanish,
spoken in the city of Iquitos. Regional Amazonian Spanish is structurally the same as the
common Latin American Spanish with the addition of regional vocabulary. Local Spanish
in the community is quite different, not just in terms of its special vocabulary, but in the
grammar as well. This profound difference has presumably been around for at least sixty
years. Due to its grammatical difference from the regional and Latin American Spanish, it
presents a border case between ‘a dialect of Spanish’ and ‘a creole.’ The current local
Spanish in the community could be derived from both the substrate influence of the
Iquito grammar and the effect of second language acquisition. At the very least, it
presents an interesting case of a language-contact phenomenon. In the following, I
discuss the fundamental grammatical characteristics of the Spanish spoken in San
Antonio de Pintuyacu.",[33]
"5 Of course, in many cases, the scope of learning is limited to vocabulary and fixed phrases.",[30]
"143In a transitive clause, the types of elements that can appear in the X position
include an indefinite grammatical object or pronoun, the determiner of the definite object,
adverbs, adverbial phrases, postpositional phrases consisting of a noun plus a
postpositional clitic, a determiner plus a postpositional clitic, and negative particles if no
other elements appear in such a position. What cannot go in the X position is a complete
nominal phrase or postpositional phrase containing a determiner. To be exact, [a
determiner plus noun]61, as a definite object, cannot appear in the X position, but [an
indefinite article, or a modifier, plus noun] can.
As can be seen in (224) and (225), an indefinite grammatical object or a
pronominal object, respectively, can appear between the subject and the verb of an
irrealis clause. In realis clauses, they appear in the postverbal position, as can be
compared with (1), (2), and (4).","[161, 162]"
"1S1S=dance-IPFV-EC sing.INF=COMI dance and sing. (Literally: I dance with singing.)Disjunction expresses the meaning of English or and offers alternatives, options
or possibilities in the sentence. Subject disjunction applies at the phrasal level in three
ways. First, we can place all elements together before the verb and use the singular form
as the subject pronoun to indicate disjunction. The use of a singular pronoun
disambiguates disjunction from conjunction in which the subject pronoun takes a plural
form to express a sense of and. Second, we can put all elements for disjunction at the
beginning of the sentence and use the word cuquisaacari ‘probably’ before one or all
elements. A singular pronoun is still used before the verb. Third, we can express one
option before the verb and displace others to the end of the sentence and connect them
with the sentence using the word cuquisaacari ‘probably.’ Disjunction of objects and
63adpositional phrases works in the same way except the word cuquisaacari ‘probably’ is
always used to disambiguate it from conjunction. Also, they do not involve the form of
the subject pronoun. Disjunction of verbs operates only at the clausal level and therefore
each verb has to appear in different clauses. Note that speakers use the word
cuquisaacari ‘probably’ more frequently than any other alternative although some
speakers like to use phrases, such as najaaja j++ta/j++ta najaaja ‘also as,’ or najaaja
cuuta ‘also perhaps.’ The following schematized diagram shows all possible positions of
the coordinator cuquisaacari ‘probably’ with respect to the coordinated phrases. There
are two observed possibilities for the positions of the coordinator cuquisaacari
‘probably.’ It can appear before all coordinated phrases simultaneously or just once
before the last coordinated phrase. Unlike in the case of conjunction, it does not appear
after the last coordinated phrase.","[81, 82]"

tenses provide basic temporal information, more precise temporal location in relation to
SpT is inferred in the case of Extended Current Tense. This is a particularity of Iquito
which makes it distinct from other tensed languages.","[113, 114]"
"If we can consider the effect of raising and control, in the case of English, it is
noted that the big PRO actually occupy a space. Applying to the case in Iquito, however,
we found out that subject control does not seem to occupy a space. For sentences (269) to
(271), we might be able to give the following analyses. In (269), the subject of the
infinitival clause is present, followed by the infinitive verb, followed by the full NP
object. In (270), the subject of the infinitival clause is controlled by the principal clause;
the space is not occupied; the next NP, which is indefinite, raises. In (271), the subject of
the infinitival clause is controlled by the principal clause; the space is not occupied; the
next NP is definite, so only the determiner raises. This structure is in a sense reminiscent
of a finite intransitive clause, as in (272) and (273).",[182]
"46the study concludes that animacy, definiteness and phrase weight do not operate on the
pattern of word order in simple transitive clauses and that the basic word order of Iquito
is SVO. In deciding basic word order, this chapter considers sentences containing the
following characteristics: independent transitive clause, affirmative, realis mood and
active voice. In addition, the subject and the object have to be expressed and represented
in complete and full nominal phrases, for example, those including nouns as opposed to
pronouns. In Iquito, there is no agreement information (e.g. person, number, gender,
class, etc.) of grammatical arguments marking on the verb, and the alignment system,
based on word order, exhibits an accusative pattern. It is noted that although pronouns in
Iquito are not agreement inflection markers, they were excluded from the preliminary
stage of investigation and the following examples do not contain them. A sentence with
the basic word order is shown as in (1). As can be seen, the relative order among the
principal constituents in the clause is SVO.","[64, 65]"

meaning that ‘the object was not big and I did not buy a big one.’ Sentence (349) is
incompatible with (350) which conveys the meaning that ‘the consultant does not know
the size of the object. It may be big or not.’ Sentence (351), again, is a repetition of what
is conveyed in (349).",[224]

by the ILDP) is also marked on the vowel (e.g. í) except when the vowel is the high
central vowel +, in which case, it is marked by an apostrophe ‘’’ preceding the vowel

"5.5.3.1 Future Context
The formative -hu++ has an allomorph -cuhu++ in irrealis clauses while the
formative -cuaa remains -cuaa. In irrealis clauses, both -cuhu++ and -cuaa attach to the
derivational verbal root in some cases, as if they were derivational morphemes. This is
observed from the stem-changing verbs (i.e. compare (738) with (748)). DEIPFVs
-cuhu++ and -cuaa, with irrealis word order (SXV), are used to indicate situations in the
immediate, recent, and remote future, which ranges from later in the same day of SpT, to
within a few days, to up to a few months. The exact temporal location is indicated by an
explicit temporal reference.
362Examples (732)-(743) in the following show that DEIPFVs appear with all
situation types in irrealis clauses. It can be seen that the sentences display the SXV
pattern for transitive verbs, as in (732)-(737). For intransitive verbs, as in (738)-(743),
adverbs can cliticize onto the subject, displaying an SXV pattern as well. Adverbs can
also appear in sentence-initial position, in which case the subject does not phonologically
fuse with the verbal complex and the long form of the pronoun is used, as in (738) and
(740)-(742). For a detailed discussion on irrealis mood, please refer to §4.","[380, 381]"

"In (737), the object of the sentence is a pronoun. It can be seen that the pronominal object
cliticizes onto the subject noun in the irrealis clause. In realis sentences, the pronoun
object stays in the post-verbal position, as in (747).",[384]
"1.2 THE IQUITO PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE
This section examines some of the most important social and historical factors
affecting the vitality of the Iquito language. The data used for this section include: 1)
approximately 9 hours of interviews with 8 Iquito speakers, recorded by Karina Sullón
Acosta, a member of the ILDP during the summer of 2005; 2) two articles by Beier and
Michael, (2002, 2003); and 3) independent observations from my own fieldwork with the
ILDP.
This section begins with a historical overview, including a brief description of
Iquito’s place in the Zaparoan family of languages, in order to contextualize the processes
and stages of language shift in the Iquito case. Iquito language loss actually started within
a historical context larger than just the language itself.",[22]
"Adverbial (b), ácariyaajaa, indicates a more distant interval from SpT than
adverbial (a) does. It is also only used in a sentence in Extended Current Tense. The44 In some rare cases, speakers produce the following sentence as an alternative of (174): Eduardo raatiiácari=yaa iina jaari. They prefer the form in (174).",[137]
"The X position in an intransitive clause, however, is not always filled by a lexical
element. When it is not, vowel-hiatus resolution strategy is blocked. Iquito exhibits a
phonotactic constraint against heteromorphemic vowel hiatus within a phonological149word.65 If a preverbal element is monosyllabic, it cliticizes rightward to the verbal
complex. As a result, it is pronounced together with the verbal complex as a continuous
sound stream. In a realis clause, the quality of adjacent vowels of the preverbal and
verbal elements is resolved by assimilation or alteration of the vowel. Instances of
underlying vowel hiatus are resolved by glide formation, vowel deletion, or vowel fusion,
depending on the morphemes and the qualities of the vowels involved. In realis clauses,
non-focal subject pronouns generally form a phonological word with their associated
verb (i.e. they behave like phonological clitics). If the verb root in question is vowelinitial, heteromorphemic vowel hiatus typically results, and one of the hiatus resolution
processes just mentioned takes place. In irrealis clauses, however, non-focal subject
pronouns typically do not cliticize to their associated verb. In cases in which an overt
element intervenes between the subject pronoun and the verb, the subject pronoun
normally cliticizes to the intervening element, instead of to the verb. Crucially, the
subject pronoun, even if there is no intervening element (e.g. in the case of an intransitive
verb in a clause with no adjuncts), still appears not to cliticize to the verb. Specifically,
the normal rules of vowel-hiatus resolution strategy are blocked, as if the subject pronoun
and the verb independently form separate phonological words. In slow or careful speech a
brief pause may even be audible between the subject pronoun and the verb. That is to say,
in the irrealis clause, it is observed that the quality of adjacent vowels remains intact, as if
there is an implicit element in the X position that blocks the vowel hiatus.
In realis mood, as in (241), the vowel /i/ in iisa- ‘urinate’ changes to /+/, and the
sentence means ‘we went there to urinate in the morning.’ If the sentence is an irrealis
one, as in (242), the vowel /i/ does not assimilate to the preceding vowel (i.e. the

qantification was discussed, including -s++, -juu, -tii, -cuu, -yuu, -yuucua, among other
morphemes with rarer cases. The derivational morphology discussed here is a
diachronically productive one, but not a synchronically productive one. Currently only a
few lexicalized words, discussed in section 1, containing the derivational morphemes
discussed here, occur with great frequency. The derivational morphemes in these cases
encode serialization of multiple (i.e. a mass number in this case) events conveyed by the

derivational morphemes, as non-lexicalized derived stems, are interpreted as being
related to event quantification (i.e. patterns of frequency or habituation), spatial
distribution, serialization, degree of endeavor and distributive events of multiple subjects.
They are interpretable, but not obligatorily used. The meanings conveyed by these
derivational morphemes are prevailingly expressed through the use of adverbials and
other lexical items. The phenomena discussed in this report are interesting for a study of
how morphological processes can become unproductive and lexicalized while the

synchronically unproductive derivational verbal morphemes, including -s++, -juu, -cuu,

languages might not be the same. For example, in Thai, according to Sudmuk (2003),
duration, instead of telicity, is crucial for events. As such, in some languages, Activities
and Accomplishments might not be clearly distinct situation types although they might
still be different verb classes, both cognitively and in terms of syntactic constructions.
Motion verbs, semantically as a verb class, are commonly considered as pertaining to
Activities in terms of situation type; Smith does not specifically distinguish the two.
However, they have been proposed, by some authors, to be distinct in the aspectual
system. Tenny (1995) indicates that Motion verbs are aspectually special. Janda (2007)
states that “motion verbs are prototypical in the Russian aspectual system.” In the case of
Iquito, the fact that the default use of certain perfective aspects clashes with Motion verbs
and coerces derived meanings, among other grammatical correlates, suggests that Motion
verbs have distinct temporal schemata, which consequently constitutes a distinct situation
type. This proposal of adding Motion as a sixth situation type in Iquito is a pioneering
and preliminary one, which is still a continuing research topic.","[434, 435]"

APPENDIX 1: EVENT QUANTIFICATIONIn many languages, event quantification is expressed through productive
morphology. In Iquito, however, it is conveyed through a set of synchronically
unproductive derivational verbal morphemes, including -s++, -juu, -cuu, -tii, -yuu,
-yuucua, among other morphemes with rarer frequency of usage. Structurally, these
morphemes suffix directly to the verbal root and before the causative and other
derivational morphemes which precede inflectional morphemes. Currently only very few
words containing the derivational morphemes discussed here occur with great frequency
in natural speech. The derivational morphemes in these cases encode serialization of
multiple (i.e. mass number in this case) events conveyed by the verbal root. As their
synchronic generalized meanings, these derivational morphemes are related with event
quantification (i.e. patterns of frequency or habituation), spatial distribution, serialization,
degree of endeavor and distributive events of multiple subjects. The meanings conveyed
by these derivational morphemes are prevailingly expressed through the use of
adverbials, in which case the presence of the derivational morphemes is not obligatory.
The derivational morphology discussed here is diachronically productive, but not
synchronically productive. When the meaning of a combination of a verbal root and the
derivational morphemes were asked for, only -s++, -juu and -tii were given
synchronically generalized meanings, all of which are optional and can be expressed by
adverbials or other devices. The derivational morphemes -cuu, -yuu and -yuucua, among
other morphemes, are only observed with specific verbal roots as lexicalized roots.
Within the lexicon of items that occur with derivational morphemes with great frequency,
the following phenomena are observed. First, some irregular roots appear in the
515underived and in the derived verbal forms which suggests that the derived verbal stems
appear to be lexicalized after the derivational morphemes attach. Second, some verbal
stems which display apparent derivational morphology do not seem to have a direct
correspondence, in terms of their meanings, with their underived forms. Third, several
apparently derived verbal stems do not have their corresponding underived forms. These
phenomena support the observation that the derivational morphology is not
synchronically productive although people can provide an interpretation when given a
derived form.
In section 1, I discuss the lexicon which contains the relevant derivational
morphemes and occurs with great frequency in the natural speech. In section 2, I discuss
the generalized meanings of the derivational morphemes synchronically.","[532, 533, 534]"

combined with ABLPFV, patterning as a Stative124 verb in this case, although the
ablative reading is not rendered, unlike with other Statives. The reason for this inceptive
reading is probably because ‘sleeping’ usually lasts a relatively long period of time with
not much control by the agent and not much variation within the entire process. To
express that the subject slept at a certain location and is not there at SpT, DEIPFV is

situation types in near-future contexts. It can be seen that the sentences display the SXV
pattern for transitive verbs. For intransitive verbs, as in (622)-(624), the adverbs

pattern as well. However, the adverb can also appear in the sentence-initial position,

independent form of pronoun is used. For a detailed discussion on the grammatical

embedded infinitival clauses besides the main verb, the word order does not display a
straightforward SVO pattern. Instead, it exhibits an SVV...OV pattern, which is also the
case in the irrealis environment (SOV word order). Example (15) is an example of a
complex verbal phrase in the SVO environment, and (16) is an example of it in the SOV
environment. It is seen that both sentences using complex predicates display the same
word order pattern—SVV…OV—no matter whether they are in realis mood (SVX) or in
irrealis mood (SXV).",[70]
"The derivational morpheme -tii has its generalized synchronic meaning as distributive
events of a collective subject, which conveys distributive simultaneous events performed
by a collective plural subject. Speakers generally indicate that these sentences do not
sound good with a singular subject and they also commented that sentences without the
derivational morphemes -tii are more common currently. The speakers Ema and Ligia, in
particular, do not like sentences containing -tii, except, of course, in cases of the
lexicalized use presented in section 1 above.
In the following, I provide examples of the verb asaani ‘eat.’ Example (1068) is
understood as a group of people eating their own food on different tables.",[553]
"In addition to subordinate clauses, Iquito also displays numerous unexpected OV
correlations in terms of word order typology as discussed in Dryer (1991, 1992): (1) it
uses postpositions instead of prepositions; (2) the time/aspect (aux) information follows
the verbal root, utilizing suffixes instead of prefixes; (3) in possessive noun phrases, the
genitive precedes the noun instead of following it; (4) and finally, the copula verb follows
the predicate instead of preceding it. According to typological studies, languages tend to
retain their old word order in embedded clauses. Iquito, therefore, could have once been
an OV language. However, what remains to be confirmed is the motivation of such a
change of basic word order and why SOV, a variety of SXV word order, is retained in
irrealis clauses. Two explanations are offered in the following. One is that in sentences
with S[V(V)….OV] constituent order, all elements after the subject through the sentencefinal verb historically constitute a complex object phrase, with the final verb as the
principal verb. Throughout the historical development, some non-principal lexical verbs
were frequently used and grammaticalized into tense and aspect morphemes, resulting in
grammatical morphemes being positioned in the post-subject position and motivating
the SVO word order in the simple clause. The other possible explanation is that the word
order change in the simple clause is a relatively recent and drastic innovation because
SVO word order, distributively more restricted, only appears in the realis simple clause.
165The motivation of this might be a calque of Spanish sentence structure from the recent
acquisition of the Spanish language. Both options are possible. However, one synchronic
observation is that Arabela, which supposedly forms a branch of the Zaparoan family
with Andoa, is predominantly SOV while Záparo, which supposedly forms a branch with
Iquito, is SVO. SVO word order is therefore a shared innovation, if indeed a new word
order, within the Záparo-Iquito branch. However, an Iquito text in Beuchat and Rivet in
the 18th century displays SVO order (Lev Michael, p.c.). The above discussion suggests
language contact is a less likely scenario since all Zaparoan languages have contact with
Spanish, but present distinct synchronic facts. If SOV is indeed the old word order and
SVO is a new word order, the motivation of such a change remains to be a topic for
future research.
The other possible word-order development is that SVO has been the basic word
order and that SXV is a new strategy in irrealis clauses and a new phenomenon in
embedded infinitival clauses and complex predicate contexts. Complex predicates,
especially complements of cognition verbs and the like, might plausibly be associated
with irrealis mood (Patience Epps, p.c.). Here the explanation needed is the mechanism
of such a word-order-change strategy. Hopper and Thompson (1980) correlate variations
in word order and relative verbal transitivity, such as noun incorporation, with
affectedness or individuation of object, which is also associated with irrealis mood. It is,
therefore, that noun incorporation is the drive of SVO to SXV change. However, this
scenario seems unlikely since there is almost no noun incorporation in Iquito, which is
distinct from most of the Amazonian languages. The motivation of SVO to SXV change
also remains to be a topic for future research.
§4.2 above gives an outline of the Iquito irrealis mood. It discusses the structural
facts of the realis and irrealis word order, and the kinds of semantic contexts in which
166each mood is employed. Iquito evidently adopts an extremely uncommon strategy, word
order change, to encode the irrealis mood. The present study proposes to include this as
one of the grammatical types by which modality can be expressed typologically. The
discussion of this section also attempts to trace the origin of this uncommon means from
a typological approach on word-order correlations. It is suggested that the earlier word
order of Iquito might have been SOV and it gradually developed into SVO word order.
This section also establishes that the choice of the terms realis and irrealis is based on the
fact that these two terms represent two different constructions which are consistently used
in sentences of different modal functions.","[183, 184, 185]"
"In (286), the negative particle caa both precedes and follows the verb marked with -ji.
The question word in the sentence is the direct object. The subject is a pronoun nu ‘3S’
and caa appears after it in the preverbal position, which forms the SXV word order to
express the irrealis mood. The indirect object remains in the postverbal position.",[193]
"272(502) (Proclitic) = (Prefix) - Verbal Root104 - (Derivational Suffix(es)) - Aspect Tense105 = (Enclitic) (Particle)As can be seen, verbal suffixation is the prevailing pattern in Iquito. There is only one
verbal prefix attested in Iquito, which is the anterior morpheme -(+)ta that goes with the
Imperfective Aspect in sentences in the Extended Current Tense to locate an imperfective
situation prior to SpT. Tense and aspect information are conveyed by an aspect suffix
followed by a tense suffix. Tense and aspect in Iquito are synchronically exclusively
verbal formatives and do not attach to nouns or other parts of speech. They are bound
morphemes because they have to occur with a verb rather than as a separate word. They
are not periphrastic expressions because the sole occurrence of an aspect suffix conveys
the aspect information. The position of aspect and tense suffixes are fixed in the verbal
complex; therefore, they are structurally homogeneous morphological indicators, as the
set of aspect suffixes form a single category within the morphological system while tense
suffixes form another. Tense and aspect information are presented, in general, as separate
formatives, except in the case of -(y)aariqu+ which is a portmanteau morpheme encoding
both Imperfective Aspect and Distant Past Tense.
In a finite clause, one of the three tenses (i.e. Distant Past Tense, Recent Past
Tense, and Extended Current Tense) or the potential/optative -cuma has to be used. As
for viewpoint aspects, either a perfective or an imperfective aspect is expressed in a
sentence. Iquito has a complex system of perfective aspects, including a General, a
Momentary, a Remote, two Deictic, an Allative, and an Ablative Perfective Aspect.
There is one Imperfective Aspect. In a finite clause, only one aspect can be used and no
104 A verbal stem is used if no derivational suffix is present before the aspect suffix.","[290, 291]"
"In (732), the object of the sentence is a definite phrase. It can be seen that the determiner
of the object phrase cliticizes onto the subject noun. In irrealis clauses, as in (732), the
allomorph -cuhu++ is used while in realis clauses, as in (744), the allomorph -hu++ is
used. It is ungrammatical for -hu++ to appear in irrealis clauses, as in (746). The
formative -cuaa does not have an allomorphic counterpart in irrealis clauses, as is
illustrated in (734) as well as (745).",[384]

-In terms of formal identity, Dahl & Velupillai (2005: 266) indicate that
“traditionally, tense and aspect are seen as grammatical categories of verbs,” but they
further comment that “periphrastic constructions…are employed in functions similar to
those of inflections”; in addition, “tense and aspect do not always present themselves as
separate and neatly delineated categories” and “one and the same grammatical form may
combine temporal and aspectual elements in its semantics.” According to Bybee et al.
(1994), the past tense and perfectives may derive from perfects with respect to
grammaticalization paths, and imperfectives from progressives. Therefore, the past tense,
perfectives and imperfectives are notably inflectional (i.e. indicated by morphological
means) while perfects and progressives are overwhelmingly periphrastic (Dahl and
Velupillai, 2005: 266). Out of 222 languages in their sample, only 101 languages have
grammatical marking of the perfective/imperfective distinction; their geographical
distribution lies “in a band across southern Eurasia from Europe (excluding most of the
270northern part) to China (but excluding the Dravidian part of South Asia and all of SouthEast Asia)…extending into Africa down to the Equator” (p. 267). The parts of the world
that do not have a grammatical perfectivity distinction include “Northern Europe outside
the Slavic area” and “large parts of South America and South-East Asia” (p.268). They
further comment that “the widespread view of tense and aspect as alternatives to each
other-that languages tend to be either tense languages or aspect languages” does not hold
and state that “in fact, there are considerably more languages in the sample that have both
the aspectual and the temporal categories, or neither of the alternatives, than have one
only” (p.268). They characterize the imperfective-perfective distinction as “the basic
opposition between one form (or set of forms) which is used exclusively or almost
exclusively for single completed events in the past and another form (or set of forms)
which is used for everything else” (p. 267). Comrie (1976: 4) indicates that “perfective
looks at the situation from outside, without necessarily distinguishing any of the internal
structure of the situation, whereas the imperfective looks at the situation from inside, and
as such is crucially concerned with the internal structure of the situation.” Smith (2005)
indicates that viewpoint aspects semantically convey boundedness by presenting the
situation in part or in its entirety. Therefore, languages that have grammatical aspects
(viewpoint aspect in Smith’s term) convey perfectivity (i.e. boundedness) information
directly while aspectless languages achieve this through inference from the situation
types (also termed situation aspect by Smith) of the verb constellation. As for the
temporal location of a situation, temporal interpretation is directly attained from tense in
tensed languages as tense provides information about the relation between RT and SpT;
however, in tenseless languages, temporal interpretation is indirectly inferred from
semantic information of aspects (which encode the relation between RT and SitT and
boundedness information) and pragmatic principles of interpretation. Moreover, in
271languages with grammatical aspects, temporal interpretation is even more indirectly
inferred from the situation types of the verb constellation in conjunction with pragmatic
principles. Boundedness information and the relation between RT and SitT are not
grammatically conveyed, but are instead inferred through the situation types. Please see
§3 for more discussion of temporal interpretation.
In terms of the position of tense-aspect affixes, Matthew S. Dryer (2005: 282)
indicates that “morphological indicators of tense-aspect are [verbal] prefixes and
suffixes”; in addition, “there are three less common morphological ways to indicate
tense-aspect,” including “tone, infixes, and stem changes.” Indeed, out of 1062 languages
with tense-aspect categories in his sample, 150 languages use prefixes, 629 use suffixes,
11 use tone, 133 use combinatory strategies with none primary, and the remaining 139 do
not have tense-aspect inflection (i.e. by means of separate words, auxiliary verbs, noninflecting particles, or clitics). He further states that “for many languages, perhaps even a
majority, the morphological indicators of tense-aspect on verbs are rather heterogeneous
and do not form a single category within the morphological system of the language.” In
addition, “there are also many languages which combine prefixes or suffixes with one of
the minor strategies.”
In Iquito, verbs, which do not inflect for person and number, obligatorily inflect
for tense and aspect in a finite clause, although sometimes either tense or aspect may be
realized by the absence of any overt tense-aspect morphology (i.e. Extended Current
Tense, General Perfective Aspect in some phonological environments discussed in §5.2).
The positions of morphemes inside the verbal complex are fixed as schematized in (502)
(repeated from (109)). The optionality and obligatoriness of morphemes are indicated by
the presence and absence of parentheses.","[288, 289, 290]"
"In the following, I discuss specifically the morphology of Extended Current
Tense. A previous study on Iquito by Eastman and Eastman (1963) presents -qui and the
phonologically unexpressed -Ø as allomorphs of a tense morpheme which means
“present (pp. 179)” or “present, done today (pp. 180).” Although diachronically it might
once have been a tense morpheme, this dissertation re-analyzes -qui as an allomorph of
General Perfective Aspect synchronically, and proposes -Ø as the only form of Extended
Current Tense. Below I present empirical grounds in favor of the current analysis and
suggest the case of -qui as an interesting phenomenon of a shift in function, within
inflectional morphology, of the same bound morpheme, as there is evidence showing that
it must once have been a tense morpheme while other evidence suggests it is best treated
as General Perfective Aspect synchronically.
First, sentences in the Extended Current Tense (with more examples and semantic
details in §3.2) represent a range of reference time from the day of SpT, including earlier
today (102), the current speech moment (103) and later today (104), to the more distant
future, as in (105) and (106). This suggests that as a tense category, definitions, such as
‘present’ tense or ‘done today,’ clearly do not cover all possible temporal references of
the situation indicated in a sentence.",[104]
"22Chapter 2:Pertinent Background2.1 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
The analysis of the Iquito temporal system in this dissertation assumes Smith’s
(1997) two-component theory on aspectual systems, as well as her framework on
discourse modes (2003) and tense and temporal interpretation (1997, 2005). Grammatical
mood is not within the scope of her theory; however, in Iquito it contributes to the
temporal interpretation of the sentence in certain cases and, therefore, is included in this
dissertation. This section gives an overview of the assumed framework on tense (§2.1.1),
viewpoint aspect (§2.1.2), situation aspect (§2.1.3), and discourse mode (§2.1.4), which
are discussed in detail in respective chapters later in this dissertation. §2.1.5 introduces
the notational conventions used in this study.","[40, 41]"
