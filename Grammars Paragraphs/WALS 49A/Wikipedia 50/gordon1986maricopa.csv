"In the third person, in fact, pronouns are somewhat less obliga­tory since in oblique case roles the third person can be expressed by
cliticizing the case marker to the verb (only one case marker per verb)
and the omission of any pronoun or noun phrase implied a third person
reference inferrable from context (discourse or physical context).",[72]
"Typically, the personal pronouns refer to singular entities.
The personal pronouns do not have forms marked with the case suf­fixes -ii or -ly.

"A noun phrase consists of, at least, a nounor pronoun stem and a case suffix.* (A noun stem consists of a noun

A more elaborate noun phrase can consist of a noun possessed by
another noun (with appropriate marking), or modified by an attributive

They are case marked using the suffixes discussed above in thesection on case marking.,[68]
"A sug- ~gested explanation for the construction (Margaret Langdon, p.c,) is that
the duu-m 'be' imparts the meaning ""it was the case that,,."", thus the
translation for (63) would literally be ""I know it is the case that you
will cry.""",[302]
"TheThe case marker wasreanalyzed with its preceding demonstrative (recall that ny is the most

Ablaut of the root vowel is used in Maricopa (and the other .
River languages) in deriving plural forms (of both nouns and verbs),
nominalized forms of verbs and causative verbs, Halpern (1956) devotes
some space, to showing the different ablaut patterns in Yuma.
Langdon (1976a) presented a set of rules to account for the
ablaut pattern found in Yuma. Yuma like the other River languages and
the Pai languages has a five vowel system which Langdon (1976a) de­
termined is derived from an original three vowel system. The qualita­
tive ablaut found in Yuma is (following Langdon (1976a).. the result of a
quantitative ablaut system and combinations of the stem vowel with fol­
lowing
suffixes participating in certain sound changes.
™ In Maricopa, quantitative and qualitative and both quantitative
and qualitative ablaut patterns are found. A list of the vocalic ablaut
which I have seen (or rather heard) in Maricopa follows.

(iv)ts'osh'babies'from s'aw'baby'ch- as noted later in the text is found after ny-. sh- is found else­
where. Before sh- it is difficult to determine whether the affix is shor t_-, since there is a phonological rule which turns sh into t_ before
sh.
It is difficult to determine exactly where this affix should be
placed. Typically, as noted it is found before the first consonant pre­
ceding the root vowel, but this is not always the case. Langdon (1970:
110) in discussing the distribution of the cognate affix in Diegueno
noted ""In multiple prefix stems where a non-initial prefix stem is a
palatal, c_ is infixed into the non-plural stem directly after the
palatal prefix, in all other cases it is infixed after the first prefix
of the non-plural stem."" This is the typical position in Maricopa,
though as in Diegueno, there are exceptions and reanalyses.
7
None of the body parts to which I have seen ny- affixed are
vowel initial (thus, none of them begin with the body part prefix ii_).
Typically, ny is prefixed to body parts which have first person pos­
sessors and it is not affixed with other possessors (though it can be).g
ny-wish looks like a nominalized verb (wii-m 'to do, have')
prefixed with ny.
(iv) va'-wii-m'I have a house'house 1-do- asp
ny-wish can be marked with aspect suffixes and itself be used as
a main verb.
(v)va'-ny- wish-k'I have a house1house 1-poss-have+nom-asp
This is in keeping with the argument which follows (in section
1 .227) proposing that ny is used to derived verbs from nouns (thus, ny
verbalizes the nominalized verb wish or uuwish) (cf. Langdon (197 8a)).
9
This prefix is probably not productive in this verbalizing use
in Maricopa; however, there is evidence that it was used this way.
Consider the following examples.

10In Munro and Gordon (to appear) it Is noted ""In many languages
the number of clauses which might he needed to translate an NP-heavy
English clause is a much greater one, and the corresponding density of
NPs per clause is invariably lower than the English maximum."" The high­
est number of arguments I have seen in any Maricopa clause is 5: &

Typically, however the number of nouns per verb is much lower than this.
^These are considered clitics rather than prefixes because they
do not trigger the phonological change from ch to sh (see rule 6 in

The identical process is attested in Yuma (Langdon (1976b)) and
Mojave (Munro (1976a)).
13'ayuu can serve as an independent noun in case-marked and
demonstrative-marked forms meaning 'thing' (used to refer generally to
a specific, but unnamed entity or to refer to some item the speaker does
not wish to specify). As an independent noun, it is full stressed.

final consonant (the consonant before the case suffix -sh) which is ny.
in the other words is n. This is no general phonological process which
dissimilates ny to n before sh, since the -ny demonstrative suffix often
appears before the -sh subject suffix. When this sequence occurs, it is
realized as [n^s] or [n^Is].

ining which is used in individual utterances.
17It is possible to distinguish between a reflexive and a reci­
procal reading in a sentence like (270). mat- ku-shiint-sh (ref- relone+pl-sj) can be put in as the final element of the subject HP or in
place of the subject NP; if this element occurs in the sentence only a
reciprocal reading is possible. This portion of a relative clause can
occur after a plural noun or in place of a noun. It cannot appear after
noun phrases conjoined by uudav 'accompany'.

This shows again that the switch reference system is sensitive
to the syntactic, rather than the semantic, roles of the WPs,Moreover,it demonstrates that variation in the choice of 'same subject’ 'and
'different subject' may well reflect that the two sentences (reflecting
the variants) may have a different syntactic organization,

This is obviously not the ordinary realis marking -k suffix however,
since it can be used on verb forms which are not otherwise marked with
the -k^ suffix to mark realis (,i*e. -m verbs),
Munro (to appear) has proposed that this -k is a case marker
used to mark the ""topic of conversation"" which has been extended to
marking full quotation clauses,(in synchronic Maricopa the ""topic ofconversation"" NP is typically marked with -m,In Maricopa, however, -mappears to be a very general case marker which could easily absorb
functions from other cases.)This seems to be the most likely explana­tion for this distribution of -k on these complement clauses.","[137, 138]"
