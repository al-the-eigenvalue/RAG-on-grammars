purest postposition, bearing no relationship to any noun, is le$, which has several
grammatical functions. Several other postpositions are based on noun stems.
These include complex postpositions that themselves consist of a noun plus
postposition, requiring a complement in the form of a possessor (cf. English at
the back of…). There are also some postpositions in the form of a noun with an
overlaid locative H(H…)L tone melody (tonal locatives).
A postpositional phrase (PP) is of the basic form [NP Postposition], but it
may be extended by adding a universal quantifier cE^w or fu@˘ ‘all’ (in emphatic
sense), or by a particle like ka^˘< ‘also’. (435.a) has fu@˘ after a PP, in a different
sense than we get when fu@˘ occurs at the end of the NP complement of the
postposition (435.b). (435.c) illustrates ka^˘< ‘also’ (§19.1.3). (435.d) has cE^w
‘all’ after a PP, and also shows how a PP can be treated like a noun, specifically
as a (descriptive) “possessor” with following Possessive ma$.

‘He will summon the people from throughout (i.e. from both of)
your-Pl villages.’ 2004.4.68.1 Tonal locatives283In addition to PP’s, which generally function as adverbial phrases, there are
numerous lexical adverbials in Jamsay. Some of these are noun-like, e.g. words
with senses like ‘yesterday’, which (in their adverbial function) can be thought
of as covert PPs with a zero postposition, just as in English (yesterday for ?on
yesterday). However, there are other adverbials of a more protean variety, not
easily connected to any other stem-class. These include intensifiers associated
with adjectives (§6.3.3.2), and an interesting set of expressive adverbials, some
examples of which are given in §8.5.8. The intensifiers and expressive
adverbials resemble regular adjectives in their ability to occur in predicative
function with a following ‘be’ quasi-verb, but even here the similarity is
superficial, in that the usual negative (‘not be’) counterparts are different; see
§11.4.3. Adverbials, even though some have adjective-like sense (e.g. ‘straight’,
‘tilting’), are not used in adnominal modifying function and do not take number
suffixes.","[303, 304, 305]"

‘(at) the time when I fed him for you-Sg’Let us consider (21.a) in detail. It begins with a temporal noun ‘day’ in
L-toned form, which tells us that this noun is the head of the relative. There is
then an H-toned pronominal for the object (as would be the case in a main
clause), followed by an L-toned subject pronominal (which is unique to
relatives and a few other subordinated clause types). The participial is based on
a Perfective verb, which in relatives takes the form of an unsuffixed Perfective
stem with overlaid H(H…)L tone. Since the head is Nonhuman, the Nonhuman
Participial suffix -Ø is used.
In the interlinears, “.L” after a gloss or label indicates that tone-dropping
has occurred, and “.HL” indicates that a H(H…)L tone contour has been
overlaid. The 2Sg object (“2SgO”) pronoun here has its lexical H-tone, so the
interlinear includes no (grammatical) tonal information.
The importance of pronominal tones in parsing relative clauses is brought
out by comparing (22.a-b). Preverbal pronominals (if not focalized or
topicalized) follow nonpronominal NPs, so 1Sg object mi@ in (22.a) and 1Sg2.8 Relative clauses21subject mi $ in (22.b) directly precede the verb. There is no structural case
marking of nonpronominal NPs, so ‘white person’ has the same form as subject
in (22.a) and as object in (22.b). The verb in a relative is a participle that agrees
only with the head, which is here neither subject nor object, rather the noun
‘day’. So only the tonal difference between mi@ and mi $ differentiates the two
sentences.

‘the day (when) I saw the white person’Another typologically remarkable feature of Jamsay relatives is that the
head noun is often copied after the main part of the relative clause, after a
Possessive morpheme. In other words, relatives can be double-headed (with
one internal and one external instance of the head noun); see §14.1.1. This
expanded type can be represented schematically as (23). No intelligible literal
English translation would clarify it much, but think of ‘the dog that bit me’ as
something like ‘dog of [the dog that bit me]’. Neither instance of the head noun
is pronominalized.
(23)[[… [… Nx …]NP … (SP) Verb-Ppl] Poss Nx]The internal head NP is built around the noun Nx and may also contain a
possessor, modifying adjectives, and a numeral. The noun (with no modifiers)
may then be repeated after the participle, with the Possessive morpheme
separating them. The internal head NP (excluding alienable possessors)
undergoes tone-dropping, while the external copy has its regular lexical tone.
Neither instance of the head noun is pronominalized. Thus ‘a man who comes
here’ can be expressed by the construction (24), the final ma$ a&-n being optional.

"3.2.2Embryonic metrical structureMany languages have stress or accent systems, which generally have at least a
partially undulating, rhythmical nature (alternating stress rules, clash avoidance,
etc.). Jamsay is a tone language, whose tones are important both lexically and
grammatically. Unlike the case in other (non-Dogon) tone languages of the area,
in Jamsay there is no “tone sandhi” across word boundaries. In native
vocabulary, long words may consist entirely of metrically light, monomoraic Cv
syllables. For these reasons, there is no phonetically obvious metrical structure
of the sort we observe in English.
However, an embryonic metrical structure is manifested in various
phonological rules, particularly those applying to verb stems and their suffixal
derivatives (including Verbal Nouns). The core sequence involved is a steminitial bisyllabic [] foot behaving metrically as a trochee [sw], i.e., with a
metrically strong 1 followed by a weak 2. Squared brackets demarcate
metrical feet. Depending on the phonological process in question, there may be
further stipulations on one or both of these syllables (e.g. as to vowel length), or
a following third syllable may be required. There is no clear evidence for
metrical structure in the third, fourth, and fifth syllables of long, uncompounded
stems or words.
The phonological processes that are at least arguably sensitive to the initial
[sw] asymmetry are those in (28). For each, I give a brief summary (often
oversimplified) of the content of the process, name the morphological
categories affected, and a schematic representation of the relevant structure3.2 Internal phonological structure of stems and words27(with the targeted segment underlined). In the schemas,  is used for a syllable
that can be of any shape, i.e. initial (C)v(˘)C and noninitial Cv(˘)C, while more
specific representations like (C)v (optional C plus short vowel) are used when
the process requires.

f. Presuffixal V2-Raising (§3.5.2.2)
process: mid-height V2 {e E) or (o ç} raised to i or u
domain: suffixally derived verbs (e.g. causative)
relevant structure: [Cv]-[Cv-(28.a) is a consonantal lenition that occurs at the onset of 2 (but not e.g.
3). (28.b-e) are vocalic deletions and other lenitions. (28.b,d) are strictly
limited to 2, (28.c) is very strongly associated with 2 though it applies rarely
(in elicitation only) to later syllables; and (28.e) can apply equally to 2 or a
later syllable but there are very few opportunities for it to apply to a later
syllable. (28.f) is not obviously a lenition process, but since raising is associated28Phonologywith lenition in (28.e) one could make a case that (28.f) too is a lenition of sorts;
it applies only to 2.
The relevant structures in (28.a-f) are sufficiently divergent to show that no
fixed “underlying” metrical structure can account for all the data. 2 is always
centrally involved, but the lenitions are in some cases extended to immediately
following syllables. Only (28.a,d) affect stems of all word classes, while
(28.b-c, e-f) apply only to verb stems (including Verbal Nouns derived from
them).
If the metrical structure were better developed, one would expect some kind
of undulating stress, so that e.g. a five-syllable word would have an audible
organization into metrical feet, e.g. [sw][sw] (with extra-metrical final
syllable). This is not the case.
A probably related tone-lowering occurs in the second verb stem in certain
types of chains, including iterations (repetitions) of the same stem. This tonelowering applies at the level of words (or stems), not syllables. See §15.1.1 and
§16.6.2.","[48, 49, 50]"

The distributive quantifier ka^˘< ‘each’ and the demonstrative nu@No$
‘this/that’ do not co-occur, so I cannot order (e1) and (e2) relative to each other.
In practice, ka^˘< ‘each’ nearly always occurs in simple NPs of the shape [noun
+ ka^˘<] with no other modifiers. The combination [noun + adjective + ka^˘<] is
elicitable in the relevant sense (with tone-dropping on the adjective as well as
on the noun), but uncommon, unless a further cE^w ‘all’ is added to insure the
quantificational reading of ka^˘<. Perhaps the tendency to avoid NP-final
quantifier ka^˘< after an already complex NP reflects a homonym clash with ka^˘<
‘also, too’ (variant ka@r<a$), which does occur freely after NPs of any shape. To
be sure, ka^˘< ‘each’ and ka^˘< ‘also, too’ have different tonal effects; ka^˘< ‘each’
induces tone-dropping on the preceding word, while ka^˘˘< ‘also, too’ has no
tonal effect.
There is some variation in ordering within (311.f) area. (f2) and (f3) may
occur in either order. (f1) and (f2) may likewise occur in either order. However,
(f3) must follow (f1) if both are present.
The two demonstratives, discourse-definite in (311.b) and deictic in (311.e),
do not often co-occur, but their combination is grammatical.
Examples are in (312), with the noun heading the NP bolded. The positions
in (311) that are filled in each example are listed in parentheses on the right. I
use _ in these formulae to indicate unfilled slots, with (e) and (f) counted as one
slot each. (312.a) has two adjectives in position (d).

6.1.2Headless NPs (absolute function of demonstratives, etc.)Headless NPs, those where the head noun is omitted and not replaced by a
personal pronoun, are (apparently) headed by another element in the NP. (For a
similar omission of head NPs in relatives, see §14.1.6). The examples of
headless NPs involve deictic demonstrative nu@No$, cardinal numerals, and
adjectives. One could argue that such phrases involve a zeroed noun as head.
In this absolute function, demonstrative nu@No$ is the most common of the
bunch, since there is no other way to express (deictic) ‘this/that’. Cardinal
numerals and adjectives are only occasionally absolute; much more often there
is a noun, even a semantically “light” one like ‘thing’ or ‘person’.
Examples, mostly elicited, of various elements in absolute function are in
(313.a-d). (313.e) has a possessor, a modifying adjective, and a numeral.

occurs in possessive constructions of the type ‘X is Y’s possession’, i.e., ‘X

This construction is confined to cases where the referent object is
nonhuman. Efforts to elicit a human counterpart, whether alienable (‘boss’) or
inalienable (‘father’), were unsuccessful. For example, ‘his boss/father is good,
mine is bad’ was always translated with the referent noun repeated e.g. (‘his
boss is good, my boss is bad’).
Universal quantifiers are not used absolutely as NPs. However, both fu@˘ and
cE^w can occur with a preceding Nonhuman pronoun ko@ (with tone dropped to
ko$) in the relevant sense; (316.a) illustrates this for fu@˘. The emphatic adverbial
so@y ‘all, everything, totally’ can be used absolutely, as a kind of NP substitute

As explained in Chapter 14, the head NP does not move out of the clause,
instead, its status as relative head is signalled by tone-dropping. The relative
clause ends in a participialized verb with noun-like suffixes agreeing in number
and humanness with the head NP, so the entire clause is morphologically
nominal. (A second copy of the head noun may appear after the relative-clause
proper, following Possessive ma$, but this is not relevant to the present point).
Examples with modifying adjectives and numerals that remain in the head
NP are in (318).

However, be$ here is really the L-toned 3Pl subject pronominal (used in relative
clauses), and has nothing to do with the noun i n

direct object within the clause). However, there are rare examples where Pl be@
does seem to remain within the head NP, in which case it (like the head noun)
undergoes tone-dropping; see (849.e).

sit.down.Impf-Ppl.NonhInternal bracketing and tone-droppingIn addition to the order of words within NP’s, we must also pay attention to tone
patterns. The NP-internal combinations in (322) require the item on the left to
drop tones to all-L. Here, the item on the left is tonally dependent on the item6.1 Organization of NP constituents231to its right. This will be called leftward tonal dependence. “X” is any word
with the core NP, excluding possessors.
(322)Tone-Dropping within NP
a. [X + adjective]
(“adjectives” includes ordinals)
b. [X + demonstrative nu@No$]
c. [X + ka^˘< ‘each, any’]For example, i $ju@ ‘dog’ has LH tone contour, but is L-toned i $ju$ in i j$ u$ jE@m
‘black dog’, i $ju$ nu@No$ ‘this/that dog’, and i $ju$ ka^˘< ‘any dog’. This leftward
tonal dependence is recursive, as in [[X + adjective] + demonstrative], which
ends up as the linear sequence [X.L adjective.L demonstrative], where “.L”
indexes word-level tone-dropping to all-L.
In the inalienably possessed NP (§6.2.2), if the possessor is a pronoun, both
the left and right constituents (i.e. possessor and possessed) undergo tonal
changes (L-toned pronominal, {HL} tone contour on noun). This is (at least
arguably) bidirectional tonal dependence.
If the inalienable possessor is a noun-headed NP, it has its regular tones, but
the following (inalienably) possessed noun has the same {HL} tonal overlay as
it has after a pronominal possessor. This is rightward tonal dependence.
Therefore “bidirectional tonal dependence” mentioned above can be
decomposed into a systematic rightward dependence requiring a specific tonal
overlay on the inalienably possessed noun (regardless of whether the possessor
is pronominal or not), and a more limited leftward dependence (perhaps
morphological in nature) affecting inalienable pronominal possessors only.
(323)[possessor + inalienable noun]
possessor:
inalienable noun:L-toned pronominals (no change on other NPs)
H(H…)L tone (with any possessor)For example, ‘father’ has a lexical form de&˘ with R-tone, but it appears with
overlaid H(H…)L-tone after either a pronominal or NP possessor: mi $ de^˘ ‘my
father’, se@ydu$ de^˘ ‘Seydou’s father’. In mi $ de^˘ ‘my father’, the pronominal
appears in a form that is segmentally identical to the H-toned 1Sg pronoun mi@
(used as independent pronoun and in several other non-subject functions), but
that has L-tone. (There is also a stem ba&˘ ‘Dad!’, used as a vocative but also, as
L-toned ba$˘-, as a compound initial for ‘father’.)
The universal quantifier fu@˘ ‘all’ (§6.8.1) has the prosodic effects on the
NP-internal item to its left indicated in (324). A preceding pronominal drops its
tones to all-L. This is leftward tonal dependence. Rarely, the pronominal232Noun phrase structureshows dying-quail intonation (). When fu@˘ follows (within the same NP) a
nonpronominal word (noun, adjective, demonstrative), the latter regularly
appears with final-syllable dying-quail intonation. When fu@˘ conditions dyingquail intonation, we have leftward intonational dependence. In either case, fu@˘
itself may have its own intonational lengthening (symbol ), but this is lexical
rather than combinatorial, and also applies to fu@˘ when it has scope over a
preceding clause or non-NP constituent.
(324)Tonal/Intonational effects of fu@˘ ‘all’
a. pronoun: L-toned, occasionally also dying-quail intonation ()
b. non-pronominal word: dying-quail intonation ()Examples: pronominal ko$ fu@˘ ‘all of it/them (nonhuman)’, nonpronominal
i $ju@ fu@˘ ‘all the dogs’. The 1Pl pronoun may even be truncated before fu@˘,
hence E$m pu@˘ varying with E$mE$ fu@˘ ‘all of us’. Rarely, there is some version of
dying-quail intonation with a pronoun (since the pronoun is L-toned, the audible
effect is prolongation): ko$ fu@˘ ‘all of it’.
The other universal quantifier, cE^w ‘all’, almost never has an intonational
or tonal effect on a preceding nonpronominal word. However, rare examples of
dying-quail intonation are recorded (n)E-& m cE^w ‘all the women’). A preceding
pronoun, however, drops its tones before cE^w, as it does before fu@˘ ‘all’. Thus
ko$ cE^w ‘all of it, all that’, E$mE$ cE^w ‘all of us’.
Finally, the NP-internal combinations in (325) involve no tonal change in
the item on the left. In other words, the two components show tonal
independence. There are some further distinctions that must be made, based on
behavior in syntactically controlled tone-dropping contexts (325.a-c).
(325)Tonally Independent NP-internal combinations
a. appositional (symmetrical), undergo tone-dropping in tandem
[X + cardinal numeral]
[X + Plural be@] (rarely)
[inalienable possessor + X]
b. structure indeterminate (since they are detachable from the head noun
in relatives, and since they cannot be followed by modifiers that
force tone-dropping)
[X + Plural be@] (usually)
[X + Definite ku$<]6.1 Organization of NP constituents233c. autonomous; only the element on the right may undergo syntactic
tone-dropping
[alienable possessor + X]
In (325.a), the left and right elements have their own tones, including at
least one H-tone (except for low-level reduction of R to L in numerals ‘2-5’
under certain conditions). This is the situation when the NP occurs in a main
clause in whatever function (subject, object, etc.), in isolation (e.g. as topic), or
in a non-head function in a relative clause. However, when the NP functions as
head of a relative clause, the NP is subject to (externally induced) syntactic
tone-dropping. In the constructions in (325.a), this tone-dropping applies
simultaneously to both the left and right elements. For example, in (326.a),
both parts of inalienably possessed sa@ydu$ de@re$ ‘Seydou’s brother’ lose their
H-tones, since this NP functions as head of a relative clause. This is parallel to
the tonal treatment of sa@ydu$ de@re in (326.b), where a modifying adjective has
been added.

In the constructions in (325.b), above, we cannot determine whether both
elements are tone-dropped in tandem. Definite ku$< is normally L-toned anyway,
making the issue of tone-dropping moot. Moreover, ku$< and (in most cases)
Plural be@ are shifted to the end of the relative clause, following the participle.
The only reliably verifiable contrast to (325.a) is therefore (325.c), viz., the
combination of an alienable possessor with an alienable noun. (The great
majority of nouns are alienable.) Here the possessor (a nonpronominal
possessor NP followed by Possessive ma$, or else an H-toned possessor
pronominal), is completely autonomous tonally, retaining its normal tones even
when the following possessed noun undergoes syntactically controlled tonedropping (as head of a relative).
For example, in i $ju@ pE@ru@ ‘ten dogs’, both i $ju@ ‘dog’ and pE@ru@ have at least
one H-tone, as they would in isolation. As relative head, this NP becomes
L-toned: [i $ju$ pE$ru$] go^˘-Ø ku$< ‘the ten dogs who went out’. However, ma@ i j$ u@
‘my dog’ has a tonally independent possessor pronominal (1Sg ma@), so when
i $ju@ drops its tones, e.g. before a modifying adjective, the possessor retains its234Noun phrase structureH-tone(s): ma@ i $ju$ jE@m ‘my black dog’. A textual example showing this is
(327), where na@m ‘people’ but not 3Pl possessor pronominal be@ drops its tones
as relative-clause head.

"2.1ProsodyPrevious published and unpublished descriptions of Dogon languages have
regularly commented that some form of lexical tone or accent is present, and
that it is subject to grammatical modification. However, no previous study has
actually analysed the prosodic system of a Dogon language.
In Jamsay, tone (lexical and grammatical) and intonation (including
grammaticalized intonation patterns) play a central role. Indeed, I know of no
(non-Dogon) language where prosody is so tightly integrated with the
morphosyntax. Working on Jamsay has deepened my conviction that currently
dominant grammatical theories, with their sharp compartmentalization of
“phonology” and “syntax,” are badly misguided.
The prosodic ingredients are given in (1). H[igh] and L[ow] are the
primitives of the tonal system. F[alling] and R[ising] are abbreviations for twopart contour tones <HL> and <LH>, respectively.

—end of both conjuncts in NP conjunction
—end of word preceding universal quantifier fu@˘ ‘all’The contribution of tonal and intonational elements to Jamsay grammar is
therefore vast. Jamsay does with prosody much of what other languages do with
grammatical morphemes, or with morphosyntactic restructurings including
linear movement. Three examples: 1) most pronouns (excluding suffixes on
verbs) show no variation in segmental form across independent, subject, object,
and possessor categories, but use tones to make some distinctions (e.g. 3Pl be@
for independent, object, and alienable possessor, but be$ for subject and
inalienable possessor). 2) NP’s X and Y are normally conjoined in Jamsay
simply as [X Y], with no conjunction morpheme but with dying-quail final
intonation on both conjuncts. 3) the difference between main and relative
clauses is largely (though not entirely) expressed by tonal modifications. In
relatives, the (internal) head is not fronted. Instead, the final word of the head
NP drops its tones, a pronominal subject is expressed (in non-subject relatives)
by a preverbal L-toned pronominal, and Perfective verbs have the H(H…)L tone
overlay. There are also Participial suffixes, but since the form for Nonhuman
head is -Ø (zero), as is the 3Sg subject form in main clauses, the Participial
suffix cannot be relied on as an audible indicator of relative-clause status.
At the lexical level, tone is also important. Most native Jamsay words are
built up with Cv and Cv˘ syllables, with a smattering of CvC and a few Cv˘C
and extra-long Cv˘˘ syllables. Cv is monomoraic (=has one mora or syllabic
weight unit), Cv˘ and CvC are bimoraic, and Cv˘C and Cv˘˘ are trimoraic. Each
mora can have its own tonal primitive, H[igh] or L[ow], so a monomoraic
syllable can be only H or L, a bimoraic syllable can be H, L, F (= <HL>), or R
(= <LH>), and a trimoraic syllable can be any of the above or bell-shaped
<LHL>. There are some minimal pairs such as di@gE@ ‘bird’s leg’ versus d i $gE@
‘row’, ç$˘r<ç@ ‘monkey’ versus ç&˘r<ç$ ‘waterskin’, and ci@rE@ ‘horn’ versus ci$rE@
‘hard wood’. Many word families include a noun and a related verb that differ
in tone. For example, the HH-toned noun bi@rE@ ‘work’ is associated with the
LH-toned verb bi r$ E@- ‘work’, and the two regularly combine in the VP bi@rE@
bi r$ E@- ‘work, do some work’.","[29, 30, 31]"

18.1.2.1 Ordinary contexts (not coordinated)
In third-person possessor function, we get the noun E$nE@ for Singular Reflexive,
and E$nE@ be@ (with nominal Plural particle be@) for Plural Reflexive. Again, the
antecedent is the clause-mate subject. E$nE@ and Pl E$nE@ be@ are also used in
logophoric function (§18.2.1, below).
First and second persons have no special Reflexive possessor forms. The
regular possessor forms for those categories are used regardless of any
coindexing to a clause-mate subject.
Singular Reflexive E$nE@ is followed by Possessive postposition ma$ in cases
of ordinary (alienable) possession. (1108.a) shows 3Sg possessor with a subject
that it is not coindexed to. This contrasts with the reflexive possessor construction in (1108.b). (1108.c) shows that 1st/2nd person subjects co-occur with
ordinary possessor pronominals of the same category, rather than taking special
reflexive possessor forms. (1108.d) shows that a non-subject NP (here the direct
object) may not serve as the antecedent of a reflexive possessor (‘his field’).

possessor) are shared with the regular 3Pl pronoun be@, suggesting that be@ in E$nE@

18.2.1 True logophoric function (E$nE@, E$nE@ be@)
For a discussion of logophorics and reflexives in the central Dogon languages
Donno-So, Toro-So, and Togo-kan, see Culy, Kodio, and Togo (1994). Of
interest is the fact that the Logophoric in Togo-kan is given as “EnE (be).”
The basic Jamsay third person Logophoric anaphor is E$nE@ (Sg) or E$nE@ be@
(Pl). We have just seen that the same forms may function as reflexives. The
logophoric is used most systematically when the antecedent is the sentient being
(usually human but sometimes animal) whose speech, thoughts, or intentions
are reported by the speaker. In this function, logophorics function a) to clarify
reference (by coindexation to a stable antecedent), b) to define the relevant
stretch of discourse as a quotation (often in conjunction with explicit quotative
markers), and c) to dissociate the present speaker from responsibility for the
veracity of the assertions made (‘allegedly’). Logophorics may be thought of as
embedded 1Sg and 1Pl pronouns within quotations attributed to a third-party
speaker.
Logophorics do not behave like other pronominals in terms of tonal patterns
or ordering, suggesting that E$nE@ is a noun. Subject category is expressed, for
other pronominal categories, by either suffixes on the verb (in main clauses) or
by special L-toned proclitics immediately adjacent to the verb (in relatives and
some other subordinated clauses). Logophoric subject is expressed by E$nE@ (or
its plural E$nE@ be@), always before the verb but not necessarily adjacent to it, and
with no L-toned form #E$nE$ (1117.a-b,d-e). Logophoric subjects are NP-like in
that they require regular third person subject pronominal agreement on the verb.
While 3Sg subject suffix -Ø is inaudible, Logophoric plural E$nE@ be@ takes an
audible 3Pl subject suffix -ba$ (1117.d-e). Logophoric object is expressed by the
same forms (1117.c).","[664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670]"

preverbal constituents. This leaves us with objects, datives, nonpronominal

the presence of a dative pronominal (15.c).

The above is somewhat idealized, since it does not consider focalization or
topicalization. In focalization (§13.1), some constituent preceding the verb
functions as focus, whether or not it is overtly marked as such by Focus clitic
y$. If the focus is a pronominal subject, it appears as an independent pronoun,
with or without y$, and there is no subject pronominal on the verb. This
focalized pronoun appears at or near the beginning of the clause (16).

‘It’s we [focus] who go to bed here.’There is also a great deal of topicalization in Jamsay discourse (§19.1).
NPs and independent pronouns are regularly placed to the left of a sentence,
usually with at least some prosodic break. The sentence proper usually has
pronouns coindexed to these presentential topical NPs (17). This is especially
diagnostic of topicalization in the case of objects, since a pronominal object is
not used in addition to a clause-mate nonpronominal object NP. Many times,
what looks at first sight like a clause-internal NP in subject or object function is
actually a presentential topic.

possessors. This applies to Verbal Noun clauses (§17.4), and to the unusual
‘before …’ construction (§15.2.4.2) in which the verb has a suffix -wv$ with
underspecified vowel. Pronominal subjects are expressed by preverbal
possessor pronominals. The basic ordering pattern is (18).

The logical subject (2Sg pronoun) is expressed as a special kind of possessor
only used with nominalized verbs, viz., independent pronoun (H-toned)
followed by Possessive ma$ (which is not used after pronominals in tensed
clauses). The object ‘chicken’ has normal object tone (rather than the tone
typical of compound initials) since it is not immediately preverbal. It is
followed by a dative pronominal (as usual, pronominals gravitate to immediate
preverbal position), then the Verbal Noun of ‘give’.

of a pronominal subject suffix. There is usually an overt internal head NP whose
last word undergoes tone-dropping, but the head can be in any grammatical
relation. The head appears in its usual place in the sentence (there is no
systematic fronting of heads). If the subject is pronominal (and not the head), it
is expressed by a special L-toned preverbal subject pronominal proclitic in
immediate preverbal position. This is connected with the fact that the normal
morphological slot for pronominal-subject suffixes (at the end of the verb) is
occupied by the participial suffix (which agrees with the head NP, not the
subject). The basic order of elements is as in (20).","[38, 39, 40, 41]"
"17.1 Quotative complement 589Quotations often include a vocative after this discourse marker. In indirect
discourse, the vocative takes the form of a third person human independent
pronoun, usually 3Sg wo@. Therefore even “indirect” quotations may begin with
what is literally ‘well, he/she!, …’, intended to suggest an original utterance like
‘well, Seydou, …‘ or ‘well, Mother, …’. I will use ‘hey!’ in the free translation,
however awkward it makes the English, to capture the presence of a vocative
without getting tangled in pronominal conversions that do not work well in
translation.
An alternative vocative substitute is ma^˘n (variant a$-ma^˘n) ‘So-and-so’,
which specifically replaces a (variable) personal name.
In addition, as is shown below, in jussives (embedded imperatives and
hortatives), even in otherwise clearly indirect discourse the verb has the same
modal category as in the original utterance. Therefore ‘He told them to come’
is expressed as ‘He said well, they!, come-Pl!’
An example of indirect discourse is (997). It occurs in the middle of a tale
that consists largely of quoted dialogue, so there is no need for an initial discourse particle to define the following as a quotation.

God (he) said, don’t he shoot Logo! (he) said.” The 3Sg pronouns systematically refer to the original addressee, logophorics refer to the original
speaker, and the original imperative negative verb form is retained without
change. Because of the importance of “direct” features in “indirect” discourse, I
often use “direct” quotations in the free English translations.
When the embedded addressee is nonhuman, it is expressed in indirect
discourse as a Nonhuman pronominal. (998) is from a tale where a girl speaks
to an unusually astute tree.

formulated with a plural pronominal (e.g. 1Pl or 2Pl), while the quoted
material proper replaces this with a corresponding singular. Example (999.c),
below, is of this type: ‘“Now I’ve seen that the millet stems have stopped
growing”, we’ll say.’ The outer 1Pl or 2Pl operates at the generalized level
subsuming multiple utterances, while the inner 1Sg or 2Sg is a representative
individual utterance.
17.1.2 ‘Say that …’ with inflectable ‘say’ verb (ga@˘-, jE$-)
A special feature of Jamsay discourse is the role of ‘say’ verb ga@˘- and quasiverb jE$- (see §11.3.1-2 for the forms). They occur not only in plainly quotative
contexts, but also in constructions that overlap functionally with temporal
adverbial clauses.
A simple quotative verb like ga@˘- or jE$- may be added to an otherwise
complete sentence, with no other overt indication of quotation status (999). In
imperfective and/or negative contexts, a form of ga@˘- is used (the unsuffixed
Imperfective is ga^- with short vowel). In perfective positive contexts, the only
pronominally inflectable ‘say’ (quasi-)verb is L-toned jE$- (unsuffixed
Perfective). The use of the unsuffixed Perfective suggests that the verb itself (or
at least its aspectual value) is defocalized.

distributivity is expressed by iterating the numeral (§4.7.1.6). A slightly marked
free translation of the type ‘All five (people) got two sheep each’ would be
closer to the Jamsay construction. cE^w and fu@˘ are interchangeable in this
construction. Now consider (396).

6.9AppositionThe sequence core NP plus numeral is structurally appositional, unlike other
superficially similar sequences like noun plus modifying adjective (including
ordinals). In the case of [NP + numeral], both the final word in the core NP and
the numeral have their regular tones; in addition, the NP has its regular (human)
Sg or Pl suffix, as it would in the absence of the numeral. When the NP in
question is head of a relative clause, tone-dropping applies simultaneously to
the final word in the core NP (the noun, or a following modifying adjective) and
to the numeral. For details and examples, see §6.5, above, and §14.1.3.
Apposition is also regular when a pronoun is “modified.” When a pronoun
(with human referent) is logically the head of a relative, it occurs to the left in
its independent (H-toned) form, in apposition to a form of i@ne@ ‘person’ which
follows. Only i@ne@ shows the tone-dropping characteristic of relative-clause
heads (397). I therefore bracket i@ne@ inside the relative clause, with the pronoun
outside the brackets. For more details, see §14.1.4.","[284, 285]"

If the subject is pronominal, it is also possible to front the object (as an
outer possessor, with ma$). The subject is realized as a simple (alienable)
possessor pronominal. This allows ‘before …’ clauses to approximate the mainclause linearization pattern whereby pronominals (unless emphatic or
topicalized) follow nonpronominal NP’s. However, since the subject-objectverb order is normal in ‘before …’ clauses, object-fronting may create parsing
difficulties (misidentification of subject and object roles). With verbs like
‘slaughter’ (944.a), the asymmetry between subject and object makes misparsing unlikely. The reading for (944.b) is unlikely for the same reason; see the
more usual reading (941.g). (944.c) is more seriously ambiguous. My
impression is that object-fronting is uncommon in natural speech, especially
when both subject and object are pronominal.

added, usually with a following Possessive ma$ (which is absent in

Occasionally there is an L-toned nominal compound initial on the pseudocausative ‘before’ verb with suffix -wv$. In this case, if there is a preceding
chained verb, this chained verb cannot also take compound-initial form, so it
takes its regular tones. In (946), the compound initial u$ro$- ‘house’ is based on
the tonal locative u@ro$ ‘in the house’, which occurs in the preceding sentence in
the text. The chained verb is su@mo@ ‘wash’.

"11.1.2 Verb types (valency)
Verbs have the usual valency possibilities: intransitive, transitive, ditransitive.
However, the distinction between transitive and intransitive is muddied in
Jamsay by the large number of idiomatic object-verb combinations (including
those with cognate nominals), and to some extent subject-verb combinations;
see below, §11.1.5-6.
Intransitives that have a subject but no direct object include stance verbs
like di N
$ e@- ‘sit down’ and atelic motion verbs like ya$na@- ‘glide’.
Telic motion verbs like ya&˘- ‘go’ and yE$rE@- ‘come’ are basically
intransitive (with optional locational adverbial). They may appear to be
transitive, like the first ‘go’ verb in (618), which has ‘place’ as destination.

[place.L Refl go-ImpfNeg-Ppl-Nonh Past all]
go.Impf-3SgS
‘Places that she previously did not go to, (now) she goes.’ 2004.3.19However, telic motion verbs, in their primary senses, often fail the crucial
test of transitivity in Jamsay: they do not take object pronominals. Informants11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure389generally rejected such proposed combinations as #ko@ ya&˘-ya$-m ‘I went to it’,
and similar constructions for ‘come’, and ‘go out’. Therefore cases like ‘place’
in (618), above, are best understood as covert adverbial PPs with the
postposition omitted. Such omission is most common with place names like
ba$ma$ko@ ‘Bamako’, which in most contexts are understood as adverbial in
nature without an overt postposition.
In the sense ‘go/come to (sb)’ with human destination, a PP with
postposition le$ or its pronominal counterparts is used: mi&-n yE$rE$-Ø ‘He/She
came to me.’
There are, however, some transitive uses of telic motion verbs in nonprimary senses. ya&˘- ‘go’, for example, may take an object denoting the entire
trajectory rather than the destination. In (619), the pronoun ko@ is the object.

including sa$- (§11.5.1). There are some ‘put’ verbs with a direct object plus an
optional locational, e.g. na@˘na@- ‘put (sth) up on (sth)’. Basic perception verbs
are transitive: E@˘- ‘see’, a@ƒa@- ‘hear’.
Defective quasi-verb ku$n- ‘be in, be part of’ functions syntactically as
though the sense were ‘be put in’ (cf. the high-frequency transitive ku@no@- ‘put’
or ‘put in’). It requires a locational complement, as in [X bE@rE$] yç@ku$n- ‘be in

derivational morphology; see the discussion of ambi-valent verbs in §9.5. One
typical pattern is where the intransitive functions as a (medio-)passive of the
transitive. There is no productive morphological passive, so the ambi-valent use
of basically transitive verbs fills a void.
Ditransitives include o@˘- ‘give’ and te@˘re@- ‘show’. They have a direct object
for the theme and a dative indirect object for the recipient. (There is no
“promotion” of the dative to direct-object status.)11.1.3 Valency of causatives
Causatives are formed from underlying transitives, as long as the semantics
make sense in at least some situation. Such causatives of transitives have two
direct objects (622).

It is reasonable to speak of “VP” in a broad sense as a clause minus pre-clausal
topics, minus the subject NP, and minus AN inflection. This notion of
subjectless VP is operative in some types of chaining, e.g. with linking particle
me$y<, and in infinitival complements as with (same-subject) ‘want’.
The linear order of preverbal constituents was discussed in §2.6. As noted
there, pronominals (dative, object, and in relative clauses also subject) normally
follow nonpronominal constituents unless focalized or topicalized. The normal
relative order of (untopicalized, unfocalized) nonpronominal preverbal constituents is (623). This order is not rigid.
(623)a. temporal locatives (e.g. ‘yesterday’)
b. subject
c. dative, object, other adverbials (direct object often last)11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure391The relative order of (nontopicalized, nonfocalized) preverbal pronominals
is (624).
(624)a. dative
b. object
c. subject (L-toned subject pronominals in relative clauses)In verb- and VP-chains, preverbal subject markers in particular occur
immediately before the final verb (e.g. the participle in a complex relative
construction), while dative and object pronominals may precede earlier chained
verbs (in bare-stem form). For examples of these ordering patterns see §2.6.
The notion of VP is sometimes difficult to apply in chains, where two verbs
arguably (but detabably) merge into a single “compound verb” and jointly take
a single set of arguments and adverbials, or a partially overlapping set of the
same. See §15.1.5 for examples. As a result, I often refrain from using brackets
to demarcate VPs in chains.","[410, 411, 412, 413]"

occurrences of a morpheme X. Recall that a-vocalism is typical in the medial B

examples of X-na@˘/na$-X, two denoting insects and one denoting a grass, are
given in (293.a-b). Also given are two fauna compounds used in hunters’ jargon
with a medial element -gç@-/-ga@-, describing gaits (293.c-d).

In the two insect terms (293.a), the initial has undergone Post-Sonorant
Syncope (60) and Rhotic Assimilation (77). The repeated element is
independently attested in one case (jo@ru$ ‘blister’), but not in the other (-so@ru$).
For iterative adjectival compounds of the type pE$y<-na$˘-pE&y< ‘very old’,
with L-toned initial and -na$˘-, see §5.1.14.
5.1.15 Instrumental relative compounds (‘oil for rubbing’)
The phrasal compounds in this section have the form of relative clauses (of
variable degree of frozenness) with impersonal 3Pl subject, an L-toned head
noun, and an unsuffixed Imperfective participle with Nonhuman Participial -Ø
suffix. The L-toned head noun often represents an instrument associated with
the activity, but there is no overt case-marking specifying instrumental or other
function. I will refer to it as the ‘oil for rubbing’ construction. An example is
(294).

‘cut’ and ‘put’ refer to actions that are closely integrated. In other cases, a single

argument, represented by the L-toned noun. However, the verb may have two
arguments, often a direct object (=patient) and an instrument, the latter being
the head. In this case, the direct object immediately precedes be$, and takes its
regular tones (i.e. it does not undergo tone-dropping). The instrumental head
noun N1 can be incorporated in either of two ways. First, it can be added in the
form [ma$ N1] after the remainder of the construction. This (uncommon)
construction is structurally equivalent to a “headless” relative clause followed
by [ma$ N1] containing the only occurrence of the head noun, a pattern attested,
but not very common, in other relative clauses; see (802) in (§14.1.1). The
second construction, considerably more common, is to prepose the instrumental
noun in L-toned form to the remainder of the construction, which can be
thought of as a postnominal modifier (i.e., an expanded adjective). This is
essentially just an expansion of the type illustrated above, with the extra direct
object noun following the L-toned head.
Both the instrumental [ma$ N1] add-on option, and the preposed L-toned
instrumental option, are exemplified in (297). This is from a longer passage
listing several earthenware (pottery) products made by women of the blacksmith
caste. The instrumental nouns are bolded in the interlinears.

‘You-Pl will take a garment for covering her on her head with a white

(‘a garment for covering her’), the phrase headed by ‘(white) garment’ is
elaborated by chaining the VP ending in ‘cover’ with a second VP denoting the218Nominal and adjectival compoundstransfer of the bride. The 3Sg pronominal denoting the bride, who is the logical
object of ‘cover’ as well as of ‘take (=convey)’, is expressed only in the ‘take’
VP. This gives us a schematic pattern (301) for the relevant part of (300).
(301)[[on her head] [garment.L white.L] they.L cover and]
[as-newlywed her they.L transfer.Impf]The two cases of L-toned preverbal 3Pl subject be$ in this part of the
construction are arguably of different natures referentially. The first, following
‘white garment’, is the impersonal and invariant 3Pl mentioned above, while the
second is perhaps a regular 3Pl pronoun referring to the people accompanying
the bride in the parade.
(301) is then complicated further by adding a [ma$ NP] phrase, with
Possessive ma$ plus a repeat of the NP functioning as head of the relative (here,
‘white garment’, simplified to ‘garment’). Such head repetition is common in
relative clauses, but all my other examples of the [ma$ NP] add-on involve just
an unmodified noun following ma$ (§14.1.1). The expected form of the add-on
in (300) would therefore have been just ma$ yi $ru@ with the noun ‘garment’.
However, the speaker elaborated this by including repetitions of 3Pl subject be$,
the verb go$ro@- ‘cover’ (now in unsuffixed Imperfective rather than chained
bare-stem form), and Definite ku$<. The final structure as seen in (300) is
therefore (302), where the two occurrences of the head are bolded.

of [garment.L they.L cover-Impf]Though productive and expandible, as the last example shows, the
construction lends itself to lexicalization, since it often denotes a common
implement or container. In some cases, it seems best to write the combination as
a single hyphenated word. For example, (303.a) could be parsed literally as
‘heart for fighting a fight (with)’, but has a lexicalized sense denoting a
personality trait. ‘Slingshot’ (303.b) contains 3Pl subject be$ and unmarked
Imperfective ta^˘<- ‘shoot’; the initial is ma@na$, whose basic sense is ‘plastic’,
most often referring to the lightweight shopping bags found in markets, though
it can also mean ‘slingshot’.

E$˘-mi@-te@˘re@ ‘time when millet begins to develop ears’ is from E@- ‘see’, 1Sg
mi@, and te@˘re@- ‘show’. The “syntax” here is somewhat opaque, but it can be
taken to have a literal meaning ‘see (it) and show (it) to me’. It reflects the
curiosity among Jamsay farmers as to the timing of the first appearance of
millet ears (seed spikes) during the growing season. Of course the ears appear
first in a few plants within a field, and in one field before another field, so there
is much interest in the first reports of ear development.","[234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"

19.2.1 ‘Well, …’ (ha@yE$)
ha@yE$ is a common presentential particle, borrowed from Fulfulde. It is used like
English ‘well, …’. That is, it often suggests a mildly adversarial element in a
conversation. However, it is often used (with no adversarial sense) at the
beginning of a quotation. It often seems to be included to signal that a quotation
is at hand, there being no other indicator at the beginning of a quotation.

19.2.2 ‘Well, in that case…’ (wa@la^˘)
Pronounced wa@la^˘, French voilà ‘there it is’ occurs in texts in situations similar
to those of ha@yE$. However, wa@la^˘, more than ha@yE$, is a response to something
just said (cf. English there you are! as a confirmation). I find a free translation
‘well, in that case …’ appropriate, as in (1156).

19.2.3 ‘But …’ (ka$˘, ka@˘, ga$˘)
Clause-initial ka$˘ (most common variant), ga$˘, or ka@˘ has the adversative sense
‘but’. This is a regional form, occuring with slight phonological variations in the
languages of the zone, including Fulfulde and Songhay. I am unable to
confidently establish a lexical tone. In isolation, my assistant pronounces ka@˘
with fairly high pitch, but most textual occurrences have L-toned ka$˘ or variant670Grammatical pragmaticsga$˘. It may be that ka$˘ is correct phonological transcription while the highpitched version is intonation, i.e. ka$˘.

19.2.4 ‘So, …’ (bE$y, hç@nç$)
Another clause-initial discourse particle is bE$y. It is best translated as sentenceinitial ‘So now, …’. It occurs in the middle of conversations as a presentential
particle, set off with an intonation break. It occurs, for example, when the
speaker is ready to ask a follow-up question of the interlocutor, developing the
preceding discourse. The particle does not mean ‘so’ in the causal sense.

Preclausal topical phrases based on Nonhuman ko@ (here with discoursedeictic reference) are also common (§4.3.2). The phrase [ko@ ku$<] ‘that
(discourse-definite)’ is often used to preface new material that is somehow
contextualized by the preceding material. It may be loosely translated as ‘so, …’
or ‘that being the case, …’, but with no strong causal connotations. Like English
so, [ko@ ku$] is often used at the beginning of a question in the middle of an
interview; examples are in (1202) and (1205).
19.2.5 ‘Indeed’ (ha$˘si@n)
This particle, of rather low text-frequency, is clause-initial. I gloss it ‘indeed’ or
‘in fact’. In addition to the examples in (1160), see (197.b). In (1160.a), the
village elders announce their findings in a hypothetical case where a cow
damaged a farmer’s field.

‘(not) any more’ (1163).

phrases with a verb like ga$ra@- ‘pass, go past’ (§19.3.4, below).
la$ƒa@ is also used to mark a major shift in topics (‘elsewhere, …’ or
‘meanwhile, …’). In (1164), it marks an interruption in a narrative sequence,
where the narrator moves back in time. The speaker has been describing how he
and a companion had traveled from Dogon country to Gao (in northern Mali).

"17.3.4.2 Recognition (inference, hearsay) construction
A different construction of the type ‘see that [proposition]’ denotes recognition
(involving inference or deduction) rather than witnessing (simple perception).
Here, instead of a relative-clause complement, we get one with ordinary AN-17.3 Factive (indicative) complements609inflected verbs (any aspect, positive or negative). As in the previous directperception examples, there is no pronominal-subject suffixation on the verb.
However, now a pronominal subject shows up not as an L-toned preverbal
subject pronominal, rather as an H-toned independent pronoun (1036.a-b).
In my interpretation, the complement no longer has a participle (with
unexpressed nonhuman head), rather a verb inflected for AN but not
pronominal-subject category. In other words, the complement clause is similar
to the subject-focalization construction, except that (in my data) the overt Focus
clitic y$ is not present on the independent pronoun in subject function. (1036.a)
is perfective negative, while (1036.b) is an imperfective negative. (1036.c) has
the ‘it is’ clitic y$ (postconsonantal i^˘). (1036.d), with the same meaning, is a
standard adjectival predicate with ‘be’ quasi-verb.

placed after a main-like clause (i.e. a factive complement) in the sense ‘it
doesn’t matter (much) that …’. There may be two mutually exclusive factives,
resulting in a parallel construction. (1038) is from a passage about how a

The Fulfulde (ultimately Arabic) noun wa@˘ji@bi $ ‘obligation, duty’ is used as a

imperfective or imperative verb. In effect, wa@˘ji@bi 

For obligational constructions involving ti@la^y, see (1089-90) in §17.6.4.
17.4 Verbal Noun (and other nominal) complements
The Verbal Noun has suffix -y@ after a monosyllabic stem, elsewhere -u@. The u@
is lost under some conditions, by Suffixal u-Apocope (67) after a sonorant
(§3.5.4.1). A Verbal Noun may be formed from any regular verb, but not from
defective quasi-verbs like wç$- and kç$ ‘be’, or sa$- ‘have’, nor from stative
stance verbs confined to inflected perfective forms such as da$˘<- ‘sit’. Verbal
Nouns are formed directly from uninflected verb stems, one consequence of
which is that there are no negative Verbal Nouns.
A Verbal Noun (or other nominal denoting an action), can be used in a
complement clause, as the following sections will demonstrate. The Verbal
Noun may be accompanied by a full range of internal arguments, so we should
really speak of a Verbal Noun clause.
Verbal Noun phrases may also function as regular arguments of verbs. In
(1041), the Verbal Noun phrase is the subject of ‘arrive’.

2004.3.16612Complement and purposive clauses17.4.1 Structure of Verbal Noun Phrase
The structure of a Verbal Noun Phrase may be summarized as in (1042).
(1042) a. the verb is nominalized as a Verbal Noun;
b. an immediately preceding chained verb appears as an L-toned
compound initial;
c. an unmodified object noun usually appears as an L-toned
compound initial:
—very common with cognate nominal or generic object (§11.1.6);
—possible for a a wider variety of object NPs when preceded by a
subject NP (in possessor form)
d. other NPs and adverbials typically appear in possessor form
—the inner possessor (adjacent to VblN) has normal alienable
possessor form
—an outer possessor (not adjacent to VblN), even an independent
pronoun, has a following Possessive ma$
Overall, the structure of a Verbal Noun phrase, especially the treatment of
preceding constituents, is similar to that of ‘before …’ clauses, which have a
nominalized verb that I call pseudo-causative (§9.3, §15.2.4.2). The main
syntactic difference is that Verbal Nouns are more prone to object-compounding
than are pseudo-causative nominals.
The word-level morphology of Verbal Nouns is described in §4.2.2.
Examples showing how a chained verb immediately preceding the VblN
appears as an L-toned compound initial are (1043.a-b). (1043.c) shows that a
chained verb retains its normal form when something else (here an object noun
as compound initial) intervenes.

NP may appear as a possessor of the VblN, unless separated from the nominal
by an intervening element such as a dative pronominal. Possessor status is
standard when the object is pronominal, or an NP that does not lend itself to
being a compound initial (e.g. a plural noun, a multi-word NP, or a personal
name). The possessive structure is seen clearly in (1044.a), where ma@ is unambiguously a 1Sg possessor pronominal (contrast 1Sg independent pronoun or
object mi@ and 1Sg preverbal subject mi $). (1044.b) has Nonh ko@ in the same
construction. (1044.c) has a plural NP (‘women’) as logical object, expressed as
a possessor with Possessive ma$.

meat’ and the like, where the object is a “real” noun, we can get either a
compound (1045.b) or a possessive construction (1045.c). (1045.d) is another
example of the compound structure.

A possessor does not necessarily prevent the noun from appearing as
L-toned compound initial, as long as the noun’s referent is generic (1046). One
could argue that the (surface) morphosyntax in such examples is of the type
‘hole-digging of ditches’ and ‘debris-sweeping of date palms’, though in main
clauses ‘ditches’ and ‘date palms’ would be possessors of ‘hole’ and ‘debris’,
respectively.

As shown below, when both the subject (as possessor) and the object are
overtly expressed in a Verbal Noun clause, an unusually wide variety of object
NPs are forced into compound initial status.
The subject of the lower verb is often coindexed with the main-clause
subject, and in this case it is not repeated in the lower clause. However, a
subject may appear in a Verbal Noun clause in certain contexts. With
intransitives (i.e. in the absence of a co-occurring object NP), the subject is
expressed as a possessor (1047).

In transitives with both an object and a subject expressed, the subject
normally appears as an outer possessor, followed by Possessive ma$ (even after
an independent pronominal). The construction is easy to elicit, and occurs17.4 Verbal Noun (and other nominal) complements 615occasionally in texts, provided that at least one of the two arguments is
pronominal. ‘Cat’ in (1048.a) is followed by Possessive ma$, as are the pronouns
1Pl E@mE@ and 2Sg u@ in (1048.b-c). The 2Sg example (1048.c) demonstrates that
the pronominal preceding ma$ is in independent pronoun (rather than
possessor) form, since 2Sg independent H-toned u@ is distinct both from
alienable possessor a@ and from L-toned inalienable possessor u$. (1048.c) also
shows that the logical object E$n)E@ ‘chicken’ appears in normal main-clause form
with lexical tones (rather than as possessor or L-toned compound initial) when it
is separated from the VblN by an intervening element (here a dative
pronominal).

It is more difficult to elicit examples where both subject and object are
nonpronominal NPs. The recursive-possession construction, of the type
[NP ma$ [NP ma$ VblN]], is what we would expect based on the preceding
examples. It is in fact elicitable (1049), but in practice speakers avoid it.

Instead, speakers generally express the logical object as an L-toned
compound initial rather than as a possessor, resulting in [NP ma$ noun.L-VblN]
with just one morphologically overt possessor (in normal alienable possessor
form), as in (1050.a-c). Some of the normal restrictions on nominal compound
initials (generic reference, no separate pluralization, no separate possessor) are616Complement and purposive clausesrelaxed to allow generous use of the compound construction. Thus (1050.a) is
preferred to (1049), above, although it allows the compound initial to keep its
Plural suffix -m. Likewise (1050.b), with unmodified ‘millet’ that can be
construed as generic, may be expanded as (1050.c), where ‘my’ is logically the
possessor of the millet, hence ‘(the) eating (of) [my millet]’. This forces a nongeneric reading of ‘millet’, but it still appears in compound-initial form; the
surface morphosyntax is, apparently, ‘my [millet-eating]’, though not in the
sense this would have in English.
However, my assistant did balk at using the compound construction when
postnominal modifiers (numerals, demonstratives) forced nongeneric readings.
So (1050.d) was unproblematic (the modifying adjective permits a generic
reading), but (1050.e) reverts to the full construction where the object (as well
as the subject) appears as a possessor.

initial seems to be regular even when it is a toponym or a personal name, as in
(1051). Such flagrantly non-generic nouns are elsewhere disallowed as initials
in noun-noun or noun-agentive compounds. This is further evidence of the
lengths to which speakers will go to avoid the recursive-possessor construction
in Verbal Noun clauses.

The strategy of expressing the object as L-toned compound initial,
regardless of generic or specific reference, makes this construction resemble
syntactic tone-dropping in relative-clause subjects, rather than ordinary compounding. Verbal Noun clauses contrast with the other productive nominalized
clause, the ‘before …’ clause with pseudo-causative nominal, which seems to
have no problem with recursive possessors.
A PP or other adverbial may appear in a Verbal Noun clause with

"8.1Tonal locatives8.1.1Tonal locative of noun stemA small number of noun stems may be used, as locative adverbs, with an extra
L-tone component grafted onto the end, which results in a final F-toned
syllable or in a …HL contour on the final two syllables. There is no (other)
postposition. In spite of the final F or HL pattern, the tone contours here are
distinct from the exaggerated “dying quail” final intonation pattern (§3.8.3) that
is used with conjoined NPs and for words followed by fu@˘ ‘all’.
The cases of tonal locative known to me, excluding similar forms confined
to greetings, are listed in (436). The inputs are of the following types: …HH
(436.a), monosyllabic Cv@˘ (436.b), …LH (436.c), monosyllabic Cv&˘ (436.d),
and nasal-final (436.e). There are no cases where a tonal locative is formed
from an (already) …HL or …F input noun, in which cases the tonal locative
would be indistinguishable from the input.

of the input noun, which docks on the noun’s final syllable. The only similar
process is the addition of an L-tone at the end of verb stems to form the
unsuffixed Imperfective stem. In interlinears, the notation “…Loc.HL” will be
used. For the phonology in detail of these two formations, see Tone-Grafting
(§3.7.3.3).
There is a shred of evidence to the effect that the tonal locative, at least in
specific cases, may still function morphosyntactically as a postposition. See
discussion following example (867), below.

Ordinarily, tonal locatives may only be formed from nouns, rather than
from modifiers such as adjectives or numerals. (For a rare exceptional case
where a modifying adjective takes tonal locative form, see §8.1.3, below.) The
noun must also be in NP-final position, i.e. not followed by an adjective,
numeral, or particle (including Definite ku$<), with a possible exception
discussed below.
In a tonal locative, the noun may be preceded by a possessor NP and/or a
compound initial (438.a).

inThe noun u@ro@ ‘house’ and its tonal locative u@ro$ are ordinarily distinguishable. As compound initials, in the main noun-noun compound type with
tone-dropping on the initial, they would both merge as u$ro$-. In e.g.
[a$ƒa$-u$ro$]-ta&N-Ø ‘(bride’s) transfer to her husband’s home’, a compound
ending in a Verbal Noun, the associated VP is a$ƒa$-u@ro$ ta@Na@- ‘move to the
husband’s home’. One could argue, therefore, that the compound initial
[a$ƒa$-u$ro$]- is really a tonal locative whose basic ...HL tone contour has been
erased by an overlaid tone contour. Again, there is no way to demonstrate this
directly.
The adverbial phrase nu$mo@ nu$mo@ ‘hand to hand’, cf. nu$mo@ ‘hand’, is
used with a verb like ‘give’, indicating that someone delivered something in
person to the recipient (not through an intermediary). For close combat, the
expression used is ‘chest to chest’, which has the same structure: gç$Nç@286Postpositions and adverbialsgç$Nç@ cf. gç$Nç@ ‘chest’. I take these to be conjunctions of iterated nouns (e.g.
‘hand and hand’), rather than as iterations of tonal locatives.
In situational greetings associated with an activity or location (‘well’,
‘work’, ‘market’, etc.), the noun specifying the location in question has a tonal
form consistent with that in tonal locatives. See (1185) and comments there.
Some postpositions are, or probably originated as, tonal locatives of nouns.
In (439), the HL contour converts a noun into a postposition, with a more
figurative sense than in the preceding cases. The complement takes the form of
a possessor. Textual examples are in (440).

"3.5 Segmental phonological rules65In the inter-word counterpart, a bisyllabic word loses its final u if this is
preceded by an unclustered r. Elsewhere r< patterns phonologically like r, but
this time it does not; informants rejected apocope of words ending in …r<u. For
example, contrast e$r<u@kç$ ‘it is plump’ with the very common e@rkç$ (from
e@ru$) ‘it is sweet’. Were …r<u to apocopate, it would be realised as …n by
Derhoticization (§3.5.5.1), as it is word-internally after Post-Sonorant Syncope
(60). Speakers seem to resist Derhoticization in inter-word cases.
The most frequent cases of ...ru subject to apocope at a boundary are 2nd
and 3rd person dative pronominals ending in -ru@, when followed directly by a
verb. Apocope is most common when the verb begins with another coronal, but
I have several textual examples where the u is apocopated before a nonhomorganic consonant. 3Sg Dative wo$-ru@ becomes wo&-r before t in (69.a), a
very common result, but (69.b) shows that the same 3Sg Dative form
apocopates at least occasionally to wo&-r before g, and (69.c) shows a similar
apocope of yi $ru@ ‘garment, clothes’ before b.

2004.3.14In (69.a), wo&-r is actually pronounced [wo&t] with r assimilated to the initial
t of the following word, though (for the sake of morphemic transparency) I
transcribe the pre-assimilation form.
Apocope does not occur with trisyllabic stems. For example, I have never
observed apocope with do@gu@ru@ ‘time’, hence do$gu$ru$ ka^˘< (not #do$gu$r ka^˘<)
‘each time’.
The two dative pronominals not ending in -ru@ are 1Sg mi&-n and 1Pl E$mE&-n.
These were probably once *mi $-ru@ and *E$mE$-ru@, or rather (with NasalizationSpreading) *mi $-r<u@ and *E$mE$-r<u@. If so, for these first person datives, the
original apocopated variants mi&-n and E$mE&-n, with n replacing the disallowed
syllable-final r< by Derhoticization (76), have now generalized.
Adjectival predicates with Nonhuman subject (§11.4.a) provide additional
cases of apocope after the rhotic: ç$ru@ ‘fresh’ and predicative ç&rkç$ ‘it is fresh’;66Phonologye@ru$ ‘sweet’ and predicative e@rkç$ ‘it is sweet’. Note that k is not homorganic to
r. The relationship of this type of u-Apocope to Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) is
brought out by the failure of long-voweled je@˘ru$ ‘bitter’ and of trisyllabic
o$nu$r<u@ ‘smooth, sleek’ to apocopate: je@˘ru@kç$ ‘it is bitter’, o$nu$r<u@kç$ ‘it is
smooth’. For the tones in e@rkç$ and je@˘ru@kç$ see Rightward H-Spreading
(§3.7.4.4).
In compounds, the boundary between the initial and the final is usually
treated as a word boundary phonologically. Inter-Word u-Apocope (and Rhotic
Assimilation (77)) may become lexicalized in common combinations. An
example is bE$n-na@˘ ‘she-goat’, cf. bE$ru@ ‘goat’.
Having described the two major subtypes of Inter-Word u-Apocope, I now
consider the morphosyntactic environments in which they regularly occur (70).
It should be noted that no inflected verb, or bare verb stem, ends in u (see
§3.4.4), so no combinations beginning with a verb are candidates for apocope.

Regarding (71.d), complex numerals are compound-like sequences subject
to (morphophonological) lexicalization. In decimal terms (‘10’ to ‘90’), which
begin with pE@ru@- ‘ten’, apocope occurs in pE@t-ta$˘n ‘thirty’ but not in pE$ru$-su^y<
‘seventy’. What may be happening here is that numerical adjacency (as
reinforced by out-loud recitation) is the mother of phonological similarity. ‘70’
shares an aversion to apocope with the ’60, ‘80’, and ‘90’, while ‘30’ shares a
receptivity to apocope with ‘20’, ‘40’, and ‘50’. These two subseries of decimal
terms also differ in tones (§4.7.1.3).
The strongest aversion to apocope is at the boundary between two NPs
(excluding the case where the first is an inalienable possessor). Apocope
between ‘uncle’ and ‘shed’ was therefore rejected in (72). Contrast this with
(71.h), above, where the same [mi $ bo@ru$] ‘my uncle’ does apocopate when it
functions as inalienable possessor, i.e. as a kind of loose compound initial.

other cases where a word apocopates directly before a word, it is a cognate
nominal, a simple noun, or a dative pronominal; all of these are liable to
function either like compound initials or like (pronominal) proclitics.
My assistant also rejected apocope before discourse marker sa&y ‘only’, and
before sa$- ‘have’ (in the negative form sa$˘-ra@-, which can directly follow an
object noun). Therefore he did not accept apocope in (74), even in sentences
where the elements shown are presumably bracketed together.

So the rule, leaving out some fine-print detail in the discussion above, can

The only other combination where /r</ is clustered with a following
consonant, at any stage in derivations, is when the same Post-Sonorant Syncope
rule (60) applies before y. This is handled not by Derhoticization, rather by
Rhotic Assimilation (77).
I know of no cases where /r</ is clustered with a following consonant other
than a coronal or y, at any stage in derivations.
ti&n-Ø ‘(fire-)wood’, in form a Verbal Noun, cf. cognate noun-verb sequence
ti&n-Ø ti@r<e@- ‘go in search of firewood’, shows that r< also shifts to n when word
final. Other verbs reject Suffixal u-Apocope (67) in such cases and therefore
avoid the problem. There are a few nouns and adjectives with a final n that
historically reflects word-final *r<, e.g. ba@n ‘red’; compare cE$nE$ ba@n ‘anger’
(originally ‘red heart’) with the associated verb (cE@nE$) ba$r<a@- ‘(heart) anger

‘(While he was working in the field,) A Fulbe herder came there

such unsuffixed Perfectives. The AN category (perfective positive) is typically
predictable in such narratives. I suspect that this is a major reason why the
""defocalized"" unsuffixed Perfective is common in narratives. Some degree of
predictability of the verb stem’s semantic content is perhaps a contributing
factor. However, in cases like ‘stripped them off’ in (550.a), the verb denotes a
new event.
After a quotation, ‘say’ is rather light semantically. While the basic ‘say’
verb ga@˘- has a full set of AN forms including imperfectives, there is also a
common ‘say’ quasi-verb jE$- used only in the L-toned, unsuffixed Perfective
(§11.3.2).
All of this suggests that, within the perfective system, the unsuffixed
Perfective in main clauses is associated with verb defocalization. This is an
elusive concept, relevant to the grammars of many languages, but with much
language-specific detail. In Jamsay it involves any one of the situations in (551).
(551)a. the verb is part of a large defocalized clausal residue (when some
other constituent is focalized);
b. the perfectivity of the verb is contextually predictable and therefore defocalized (as in the middle of narratives where many events
are recounted in chronological order, in perfective aspect); perhaps
low information value of the verb’s own content is also a contributing factor;10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs347c. semantically “light” perfective quotative verb (‘said’) after
quotation.
The all-L tone pattern and the lack of overt AN suffixation can, in this light,
be considered to be iconic.
The expanded use of the unsuffixed Perfective, albeit with a different tone
pattern, in relative clauses might be interpreted as reflecting an overall reduction
in focal salience of the verb and other constituents in relative clauses.
There are analogues to the L-toned unsuffixed Perfective with predicative
adjectives and with negative verbs. When a predicative adjective is defocalized,
it not only drops its tones, but also omits the otherwise usual cliticized ‘be’
quasi-verb (§11.4.2). With negative verbs, the regular form (not defocalized)
has L-toned verb stem plus H-toned suffix (Perfective Negative -li@-, Imperfective Negative -go@-). Therefore the only audible cue to defocalization is that
the tone on the suffix drops to L-tone, as seen in (748) in §13.1.2 and (751) in
§13.1.3. There is no overt defocalization for positive imperfective verbs.
10.1.2.3 Marked Perfective (-ti $-, -yE$-/-ya$-, -a^˘-)
The suffixal (=marked) Perfective is used in positive main clauses where the
verb is not defocalized. The suffixed Perfective is almost always replaced by the
unsuffixed Perfective in relative clauses and related subordinated clauses.
There are two basic morphological types of Perfective (positive), one with
-ti -$ and one with -yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘-. The first is always a classic perfective, while
the second can be interpreted either as perfective in the same classic sense, or as
a resultative-stative.
The choice between the two major Perfective types depends chiefly on the
transitivity and (especially among intransitives) on the semantic type of the
verb. The division is summarized in (552). For perception verbs, which do not
readily co-occur with either Perfective suffix allomorph, see §10.1.2.4.
(552)-ti -$most transitives

(basically intransitive) motion verbs
(basically intransitive) stance verbs
intransitive (inchoative) adjectival verbs
other intransitive stative verbs348Verbal inflectionExamples of verbs taking -ti $- are: a) classic transitives cE@jE@- ‘cut’
(cE@jE@-ti -$ ), de$ne@- ‘want, love’ (de$ne@-ti -$ ), pa@ƒa@- ‘tie’ (pa@ƒa@-ti $-); and b) active
intransitives plus weak transitives that regularly take fixed “objects” such as
cognate nominals (gç@lç@rç@) dç$n)ç@- ‘snore’ (dç$n)ç@-ti -$ ), (ni@˘) i n
$ e@- ‘bathe’
(i n
$ e@-ti-), mç$w<ç@- ‘laugh’ (mç$w<ç@-ti -$ ), te@ge@- ‘speak’ (te@ge@-ti $), yi n
$ e@‘breathe’ (yi n
$ e@-ti -$ ), and pe@re@- ‘jump’ (pe@t-ti -$ , but with variant pe@y-ya$-).
I have no clear idea as to the origin of -ti -$ . It most likely has a common
history with ti@ as a linker (indicating a sequential chronological relationship)
among chained verbs (§15.1.16). There is some possibility of a more distant
connection with the transitive verb ti@˘- ‘send’.
The choice between -yE$-/-ya$- on the one hand and -a^˘- on the other is based
on the phonological form of the verb, as summarized in (553). Variation
between -yE$- and -ya$- is free; both occurred in my tapes in the speech of
individual informants, and it was often difficult to distinguish them.

b. -a^˘nonsyncopating bisyllabic stems
trisyllabic and longer stemsThe allomorph -yE$-/-ya$- perhaps derives historically from ya&˘- ‘go’. Indeed,
many of the verbs taking -yE$-/-ya$- are motion verbs. It seems unlikely that
allomorph -a^˘- is historically related to the phonologically similar verb a@˘‘catch’, but -a^˘- might have some historical connection to (the onset of) the
Habitual suffix -a@˘ra$- in the imperfective system.
Monosyllabic stems with -yE$-/-ya$- include dç@˘- ‘arrive, reach’ (dç@˘-ya$-),
go@˘- ‘go out’ (go@˘-ya$-), be@˘- ‘stay, live’ (be@˘-ya$-), ni@˘- ‘sleep’ (ni@˘-y<a$-), na@˘‘pass the night’ (na@˘-y<a$-), and ya&˘- ‘go’ (ya&˘-ya$-).
Syncopating bisyllabic stems (those of shape Cvrv- or Cvr<v- ) that take
-yE$-/-ya$- include yE$rE@- ‘come’ (ye&y-ya$-), ga$ra@- ‘pass by’ (ga&y-ya$-), lo@ro@- ‘get

(mç&y<-y<a$-), and u$rç@- ‘go up’ (u&y-ya$-). On Post-Sonorant Syncope (60), which
(with two exceptions not relevant to this section) applies only to CvCv- stems
with short vowels and with medial rhotic r or r<, see §3.5.3.2.
Nonsyncopating bisyllabics with -a^˘- include na@Na@- ‘forget’ (na@N-a^˘-),
ti@me@- ‘resemble’ (ti@m-a^˘-), nu$mo@- ‘fall’ (nu$m-a^˘-), su$go@- (su$g-a^˘-), di N

(do$n)-a^˘-).
Trisyllabic examples are ko@mo@n)o@- ‘became wrinkled’ (ko@mo@n-) a^˘-),
na@Na@-r<a@- ‘remember’ = reversive of ‘forget’ (na@Na@-r<-a^˘-), and ba$na$-r<a@‘become red’ (ba$na$-r<a^˘-).
The rare combination of-yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘- with a syntactically transitive verb
is illustrated in (554). The few verbs in question are the very epitomes of wimpy
transitivity.

themselves to either the (classic) perfective or the stative-resultative reading.
Thus ni@˘-y<a$-Ø can mean ‘he/she went to sleep’ (perfective, event completed
before time of reference), or ‘he/she is sleeping’ (stative-resultative, state
continuing into the present). Motion verbs favor the straight perfective reading,
though of course a completed motion event also creates a state. Thus go@˘-ya$-Ø
‘he/she went out’, contextually also ‘… has gone out’ = ‘… is out, is not here’.
Adjectival stative verbs also favor the perfective (in this case inchoative)
reading, e.g. ‘became red’, but for a different reason, viz., the adjective itself is
used predicatively to denote a timeless state: predicate adjective ba@nkç$ ‘it is
red’, intransitive perfective ba$na$-r<-a^˘-Ø ‘it became red’ or ‘… has become
red’.
The fact that the Perfective suffixes can differentiate transitive and
(intransitive) stative verbs makes it easier to understand why Jamsay has so
many ambi-valent stems that can be transitive or intransitive. For example,
do@mno@- ‘finish’ has two Perfective forms, each associated with a particular
valency: do@mno@-ti -$ in transitive function (‘X finished Y’), but do@mn-a^˘- in
intransitive function (‘Y came to an end’). Likewise, with an inchoativefactitive pair of deadjectival verbs, du$gu$-no@-ti -$ must be interpreted as transitive factitive ‘X fattened Y’, while du$gu$-n-a^˘- can only be intransitive
inchoative ‘Y became fat’.","[366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371]"
"10.4.3 Hortative (-m@)
The Hortative has an H-toned suffix -m@, following a verb stem with all-L tones.
The high-frequency form ya$-m@ ‘let’s go!’ has a short vowel, but other Cv˘verbs retain their lexical long vowel: go$˘-m@ ‘let’s go out!’, ja$˘<-m@ ‘let’s dig!’,
nç$˘-m@ ‘let’s drink!’. The hortative does not occur with short-voweled Cv- or
CvC- quasi-verbs (wç$- ‘be’, sa$- ‘have’, ku$n- ‘be in’, see §11.2 and §11.5),
perhaps for semantic as well as morphological reasons. Defective stance verbs
like da$˘<- ‘be sitting’ (§11.2.4) also lack hortatives. This is reasonable, since an
exhortation to action naturally calls for an active verb subject to volitional
control, as in di N
$ e$-m@ ‘let’s sit down!’ (verb di N
$ e@-). I have also been unable to
elicit hortatives based directly on adjectives like jE@m ‘black’ in predicative
function, though hortatives can be elicited from inchoative verbs like jE$m-nE@‘become black’, and from combinations with ‘be’ verbs like be@˘-.
I transcribe e.g. ya$-m@ with the H-tone marker on the suffixal C. A
representation ya&-m would convey the pronunciation, given my transcription
conventions, but ya$-m@ brings out the fact that the rising tone is determined by
the suffix, not by the lexical tone of the stem.
The Hortative is distinguishable (by this tone pattern) from another suffix
-m used in ‘so that …’ and ‘had better’ clauses, with the lexical tone of the verb
(§17.6.4). Hortative -m@ should also be distinguished from two atonal -m
suffixes, 1Sg subject -m and Pl Participial -m.
If speaker and (singular) addressee are involved, i.e. in the first person
inclusive dual context, there is no further suffixation. Therefore the form in -m@
is basically a first inclusive dual hortative, though it may extend loosely to
include larger numbers (see below). The 1Pl pronoun E@mE@ is optionally
preposed, which avoids any possible ambiguity with 1Sg unsuffixed
Perfectives. Examples are in (602). As with the Imperative, only the final verb
in a verb-chain takes Hortative form (602.a-b).

2004.3.1When the subject in this construction is pronominal, it must be expressed as
an independent third-person pronoun (3Sg wo@, 3Pl be@, Nonh ko@), rather than
as an L-toned preverbal subject or as a pronominal-subject suffix on the verb.
This is seen in (609.a). Moreover, the reflexive-possessor construction may
not be used; if there is a direct object possessed by the relevant third person, it
appears with regular third person possessor (e.g. 3Sg wo@) rather than with
Reflexive possessor E$nE@ ma$ (§18.1.2). This is illustrated in (609.b).

Instead, the third-person “subject” is best taken as an indirect second person,
representing the imposition of the current deictic organization on an
“underlying” or virtual 2Sg (or 2Pl) pronoun. The “subject” can be taken as
vocative in function, even though the “addressee” is typically not present.
Schematically, ‘(hey) you, come!’ is converted into “(hey) him, come!” In
(609.b) and (610.b), the “reflexive possessor” likewise results from converting
an “underlying” 2Sg (or 2Pl) possessor pronoun to third person to conform to
the current deictic center. Schematically, ‘(hey) you, eat your mango!’ is
converted to ‘(hey) him, eat his mango!’ Since there is no overtly reflexive
marking for second person possessor (as in ‘you ate [your mango]’), there is no
reflexive marking after the conversion to third person, even though a true third
person construction (‘he ate [his (own) mango]’) does require an overtly
reflexive possessor pronominal.
Nothing blocks Logophoric pronominalization in the same constructions, as
long as the logophoric antecedent is the author of the command or wish (611).

‘Theyx said (to each other), “let’sx eat ourx mangoes!”’10.4.5 Imperative with implied first person singular subject
A first-person “imperative” is used as a query as to whether the addressee wants
the speaker to do something. The presence of the interrogative particle ma (ma@,
ma$) at the end indicates that this is not a true, addressee-directed imperative. A10.4 Imperatives and hortatives385first person independent pronoun may be added at the beginning, in “topic”
function.
This construction is typically used when the speaker did not clearly hear
something just said, or is responding to a gesture or a plaintive look, and seeks
clear(er) instructions. In local French, this is expressed with de plus infinitive:
d’amener le repas? (‘shall I bring the meal?’).

Q11 VP and predicate structure11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure
11.1.1 Verb types (forms)
Inflectable verb stems (including derivational but not AN suffixes) are
predominantly of the following shapes (the initial C is optional): Cv˘-, CvCv-,
Cv˘Cv-, and CvCvCv- (rarely CvCvCvCv-). There are a modest number of
CvCCv- stems of native Dogon origin, generally reflecting syncope from
*CvCvCv-, and there are quite a few verbs borrowed from Fulfulde with shapes
like CvCCv-. For patterns of vocalic harmony applicable to verbs, see §3.4.5.
I use the term quasi-verbs to denote any of a small set of predicative
elements, with specialized grammatical functions, that have the extra-short
shape Cv- or in one case CvC-. Several of these (jE$-, sa$-, wç$-, kç$-, ku$n-) are
limited to the unsuffixed Perfective in positive clauses. That is, they are
followed (in positive utterances) only by pronominal-subject suffixes. Except
for jE$-, which is positive only, the quasi-verbs also have irregular, aspectually
undifferentiated negative forms.
jE$- ‘say’ and sa$- ‘have’ can arguably be identified morphemically with
aspectual suffixes (Recent Perfect -jE$-, Resultative -sa$-). This raises the
possibility that they are AN suffixes in the special case where the preceding
verb-stem slot is phonologically empty.
On the other hand, wç$- and kç$- ‘exist’, which are differentiated as human
and nonhuman, have a striking resemblance to third person pronominal wo@
(human singular) and ko@ (nonhuman), respectively. In addition, a clitic kç$$ is
used for Nonhuman subject in the unsuffixed Imperfective. This suggests that
quasi-verbs wç$- and kç$- ‘exist’ might be pronominals, or more specifically
(imperfective) pronominal-agreement morphemes, again following a
phonologically empty verb-stem slot. ku$n- ‘be in’, with its unique CvC- shape,
functions (in part) as an irregular, and semantically specialized, passive of the
common verb ku@no@- ‘put’.
The morpheme-class status of all of these elements is at best ambiguous,
but the issues are different in each case, hence my term of convenience “quasiverb.” I have previously used the term in connection with similar issues in
Songhay languages. Quotative wa, however, cannot directly take any verbal
inflectional material and is unambiguously a particle.","[403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408]"
"1.4.1FieldworkI have been involved in fieldwork on languages of northern Mali since 1989.
Publications (grammars, dictionaries, texts) have appeared for several Songhay
languages, Hassaniya Arabic, and Tamashek.
Since Dogon as a whole is little-known linguistically, since the Dogon are
known to be ethnographically interesting, and since I had already worked in on6Introductiontwo Songhay languages in the same general eco-zone (Tondi Songway Kiini
and Humburi Senni), I decided to shift to Dogon as my next fieldwork target.
I have long recognized that a large team project would be useful for Dogon,
but by 2004 I had secured funding only for a solo project. I chose to focus on
Jamsay, while beginning parallel work on other, as yet completely undescribed,
Dogon languages of the Douentza and Boni regions.
In preparation, I spent about 9 days in summer 2003 doing rapid-fire
lexicographic work on Jamsay. This permitted me to put together a rudimentary
working lexicon back in the U.S. With funding for a sabbatical year secured, I
began sustained fieldwork in July 2004. Though based in Douentza, during
August and September 2004 I spent 4-8 days each in Dianwely Kessel (a nearby
Jamsay-speaking village), Toupéré (Tabi-Sarinyere language), Beni (Beni-Walo
language), Anda (NaNa language), and Koubewel (Najamba = Bondu language).
This allowed me to survey the languages of the region, make contacts with
potential future informants and assistants, do the flora and fauna terminology
(with extensive flora collecting by my assistants), and in some cases to make
tape recordings.
In October and November 2004, back in Douentza, I focused on
transcribing Jamsay texts, extending the lexicon, and on drafting this grammar.
The work was largely completed during 2005, and polished up during a long
stint in Douentza in 2006.
By 2006 I was working on a broader comparative Dogon project, with my
own contribution focused on the languages mentioned above in the northern and
northeastern Dogon areas. In this context I am shifting toward electronic
dissemination of lexical and textual data, while continuing to publish the
grammars in print form. The project is in the process of putting up a
comparative Dogon website (www.dogonlanguages.com) beginning with lexical
data, and the plan is to integrate textual data as time goes on.","[27, 28]"
"15possessor NP followed by ma$ ‘of’, or simple pronoun as possessor
noun stem
adjective (simple or expanded)
demonstrative or ‘each, any’ quantifier
numeral, Pl particle, and/or Definite particle
‘all’The noun stem itself may be a compound. Many human nouns, and
adjectives when referring to a human, take the suffix Sg -n or Pl -m. Human
nouns that for one reason or another cannot take these suffixes (e.g. most kin
terms) may be followed by Pl particle be@. Nonhuman nouns lack morphological
number marking, but they can be followed by be@ to emphasize plurality.
An example of a fairly complex NP is (10), with the head bolded in the
interlinear. It consists of a possessor, a head noun, two modifying adjectives,
and a Pl morpheme. ‘House’ and ‘small’ undergo tone-dropping to all L-tones
(indicated by “.L” in interlinears) because each is followed by a modifying
adjective. The possessor (1Sg) and the final Pl morpheme be@ do not interact
tonally with the head noun or with the adjectives. One can therefore bracket off
an inner core NP defined by tonal interaction, as opposed to peripheral
elements that have no tonal interaction with the core (tonal independence).

[1SgP [house.L small.L white] Pl]
‘my small white houses’More complex examples are given in §6.1; of particular interest are
numerals, which do not interact tonally with preceding nouns and adjectives
(§6.5), and inalienable possessors for kin terms, which force a tone overlay on
the kin term itself (§6.2.2).
In addition to tonal dependence versus independence, a further issue
relevant to internal NP structure is what happens when a multi-word NP
functions as head of a relative. For example, if (10) is a relative head, as in (11)
below, its first four words remain together (though pi@ru@ drops tones to become
pi r$ u$), but Plural be@ detaches itself and appears at the end of the relative clause,
following the participialized verb (and, usually, Definite ku$<).

[1SgP [house.L small.L white.L] fall.Perf.HL-Ppl.Nonh Def Pl
‘my small white houses that fell’There is a partial correlation, among postnominal elements in NPs, between
such detachability and the lack of tonal interaction when adjacent. However,16Sketchthe correlation is imperfect; for example, cardinal numerals have no tonal
interaction with preceding nouns, but are not detachable.
Pronominal categories are 1Sg, 1Pl, 2Sg, 2Pl, 3Sg (human), 3Pl (human),
and Nonhuman. They are expressed as subject-pronominal suffixes on verbs
(with 3Sg and Nonhuman merged as zero in most AN categories), as procliticlike particles preceding verbs or postpositions, and as independent pronominals.
Anaphorics include a Reflexive pronoun i n
$ i $w<e@ (§18.1), a set of expressions
of the type ‘my/your/his head’ with reflexive-like functions (§18.1.3), and a
noun-like morpheme E$nE@ (plural E$nE@ be@) that is used both for third person
reflexive possessor (‘he killed his own dog’, §18.1.2) and, in third-person
reported speech and thought, as a syntactically unrestricted logophoric pronoun
coindexed with the quoted author (‘she said/thought [she would come]’,
§18.2.1).","[37, 38]"
"6.8 Universal and distributive quantifiers257With a nonhuman pronoun, ku$< occurs in the high-frequency combination
ko@ ku$< ‘that’, denoting some entity or situation previously introduced into the
discourse, often in a resumptive fashion (as topic of a following sentence). A
good example with clear discourse context is the third line of (408). Other
examples of ko@ ku$< are (192), (207.a), (280.b), (484.a), and (507.a).
6.8Universal and distributive quantifiers6.8.1‘Each X’ (ka^˘<) and ‘all X’ (cE^w, fu@˘, so@y)Three forms are relevant here. Distributive quantifier ka^˘< behaves like an
adjective (or compound final), forcing tone-dropping on a preceding noun. It is
best glossed ‘each, every’, and occurs most often in simple NP’s consisting just
of [noun (+ adjective) + ka^˘<]. It does not co-occur with determiners
(demonstratives, Definite) or with other quantifiers such as cardinal numerals. It
must be distinguished from homonym ka^˘< ‘also, too’ (variant ka@r<a$), which
occurs freely after a wide range of NPs (and other constituents) and has no tonal
effect on the preceding word (§19.1.3).
Universal quantifiers cE^w and fu@˘ (the latter also pronounced pu@˘ after a
nasal) are more emphatic, may be glossed in context as ‘all’ or less often ‘each,
every’, and occur at the end of the constituent they have scope over. cE^w and
fu@˘ do not force tone-dropping on a preceding nonpronominal NP. However, fu@˘
does induce the dying-quail final intonation (symbol ), i.e. prolongation and
exaggerated falling tone, on the preceding word when it modifies a
nonpronominal NP (§3.8.3): u$r<o@ fu@˘ ‘every hole’, roughly phonetic [u$r<o@o#o$
fu@˘]. The  effect is usually omitted, but occasionally audible, in pronominal
combinations, e.g. [ko$() fu@˘] ‘all of it, everything’.
Both cE^w and fu@˘ force L-tone on a preceding pronominal (but not noun):
E$mE$ cE^w or E$mE$ fu@˘ ‘all of us’. ‘Everything’ is expressed by [ko$ ce^w] or [ko$
fu@˘], where ko$ can be taken as the tone-dropped counterpart of Nonhuman
pronoun ko@, or (less likely) as the prenominal demonstrative ko$. 1Pl E@mE@ is
often apocopated before fu@˘, with the f then hardening to p after the nasal: E$m
pu@˘ ‘all of us’. fu@˘ is sometimes itself prolonged intonationally: fu@˘. An
elicited example is (381), where fu@˘ shifts to pu@˘ after a nasal. I have difficulty
in text transcriptions determining when the intonational marking  is justified
for fu@˘, since universal quantifiers are naturally emphatic.

adverbial function) is separated from the relevant NP constituent by another
element. Thus, ‘I gave him all the money’ is expressed with the ordering
[[money Def all] 3Sg-Dat give.Perf.L-1Sg] ([bu@˘du$ ku$< fu@˘] wo$-ru@ o$˘-m),
rather than as #[[money Def] 3Sg-Dat all give.Perf.L-1Sg] (#[bu@˘du$ ku$<]
wo$-ru@ fu@˘ o$˘-m) with the quantifier “floating” into preverbal position.
However, a topical NP like ‘the money’ in (382) may be resumed by a
pronominal plus quantifier.

fu@˘ ‘all people, everyone’. By contrast, this stem appears as i n
$ e$ without suffix
(and with tones dropped) before ka^˘< ‘each’, hence i $ne$ ka^˘< ‘each person’. A
possibly related quirk is that i n
$ e$ ka^˘< is sometimes applied to nonhuman
entities in the sense ‘each one’ (383).

in dç$ƒç$-n ka^˘< ‘each Dogon’ and n)E$-n ka^˘< ‘each woman’.
(384) shows that all three quantifiers can be used at least loosely in
distributive sense. The version with ka^˘< (384.a) is clearly predominant in this
context (if the noun has no other modifiers). However, if special emphasis is
placed on the fact that every single person was given a sheep, a singular
countable noun may be followed by cE^w or by fu@˘.

positive forms of the imperfective system, namely the Habitual in -a@˘ra$-, the
marked Imperfective in -tç@ƒç$-, and the reduplicated Imperfective. However,
-a@˘ra$- and -tç@ƒç$- may also be followed directly by (stative) Negative -la@(§11.4.3), with no tone-dropping of the stem or of the inner AN suffix. This
suggests that -la@- in this combination is phonologically peripheral to the
preceding stem, unlike the case with other AN suffixes. See also discussion of

in favor of inserting ma$ before the verb here.

The unmarked simple conditional clause is of the form [S1 dey, S2]. In this
construction, S1 denotes an eventuality that has occurred, does occur, or may
occur. The pitch of dey is variable. When clause-final, it behaves as an atonal
morpheme, which then copies the final tone of the preceding word, see AtonalMorpheme Tone-Spreading (137). Because of the way H- and L-tones pattern
with AN suffixes, in practice we get de@y after negative verbs (if not
defocalized) and after lexical-stem pseudo-participles, but de$y in the more
common combination with a preceding positive verb.
When non-clause-final (i.e. when followed by another particle), the basic
form is H-toned de@y. In some high-frequency combinations this simplifies to de@
(§16.1.3).
Both antecedent and consequent clauses have main-clause form in the
great majority of cases, so their verbs have pronominal suffixes as appropriate.
dey occurs at the end of the antecedent clause, which normally precedes the
consequent, though occasional textual examples of postposed antecedent
clauses (probably afterthoughts) have turned up. The construction is very
common, and one can often translate dey as ‘when …’ instead of as ‘if’. In
other words, [S1 dey, S2] may simply indicate chronological ordering, as in the
description of a complex activity involving multiple sequential actions, so long
as there is some connection between these actions (a necessary sequencing, for
example). The [S1 dey, S2] construction therefore competes with the explicitly
temporal [[S1 (ga@˘) ka^n], S2] construction (§15.2.2.1).
16.1.1 Regular antecedent clause with pronominal subject suffix
The unmarked AN category for the antecedent is a perfective-system verb. The
Resultative suffix -sa$- is very common with active (non-stative) verbs, though
all other perfective-system suffixes (including Perfective -ti -$ and Recent
Perfect -jE$-) and the unsuffixed Perfective are possible. A pronominal subject is
usually expressed as a pronominal subject suffix on the verb (see the
immediately following section for a distinct pattern with preverbal subject
pronominals).","[594, 595, 596, 597, 598]"

A clause-final morpheme na$˘ may occur at the end of a clause immediately
followed by another clause.
In each textual example there is some kind of adversarial relationship
between the two clauses, so a gloss ‘though, however’ is often appropriate. For
example, my assistant commented that textual example (1101.a) could also be
phrased with na$˘ as (1101.b). The adversarial relationship that is merely implied
by juxtaposing positive and negative clauses in (1101.a) is made more explicit
by adding na$˘. A similar reading is possible in (1102), though the logical

reflexive, topic-indexing, logophoric, and reciprocal.
The forms i $ni w
$ <e@ (e.g. reflexive object) and E$nE@ (e.g. reflexive possessor,
logophoric) may be related to each other and to the noun i@ne@- ‘person’ (e.g. Sg
i@ne@-n). E$nE@ has a dialectal variant i n
$ e@-. Both i n
$ i $w<e@ and E$nE@ are morphologically nouns rather than pronouns. They may be followed by regular
nominal postpositions, but do not have special dative clitic forms like those of
true personal pronouns, E$nE@ (but not i n
$ i $w<e@) may be pluralized by adding
particle be@.
18.1 Reflexive
18.1.1 Reflexive non-subject arguments (i $ni w
$ <e@)
Reflexive i n
$ i $w<e@ is an anaphor that is coindexed with the clause-mate subject.
It may function as a direct object or postpositional complement. Further detail
on the syntax is given in §18.4, below.
Reflexive object is expressed by the invariant noun i n
$ i $w<e@, which does not
agree with the subject in person, humanness, or plurality (1104).

A following verb may also occur in the unmarked Perfective. This
defocalization of the verb suggests that the Reflexive pronoun is (covertly)
focalized. Therefore (1105.a), below, is available as an alternative to (1104.a),
above. (1105.b) shows that overt focalization with y$ clitic is also possible.","[661, 662, 663, 664]"
"6.3.3.2Adjectival intensifiersLike other languages of the zone (e.g. Fulfulde, montane Songhay languages),
Jamsay has a number of intensifiers that are used chiefly with adjectives,
especially in predicative function. They do not occur in my recorded texts, but
do occur in more lively conversation.
Most Jamsay intensifiers are frozen full-stem reduplications based on
CvC or CvCv “stems” that do not occur elsewhere. Nearly all are H-toned
throughout. An example is ku@ju@-ku@ju@, which is paired with jE@m ‘black’.
There are two constructions. In one, the semantically primary adjective
immediately precedes the intensifier and takes L-tones, i.e., it is tone-dropped
(351.a). The ‘be’ quasi-verb, if present, follows the intensifier. Here the
adjective and intensifier behave like any two modifying adjectives in sequence.
In the other construction, the ordering is the same but there is no tonal
interaction, and the ‘be’ quasi-verb is added directly to the primary adjective
(351.b). Here the intensifier patterns as a loosely attached adverbial.

other reduplicative intensifiers in its tonal pattern. It seems to have some
relationship with the adjective cE$tE@ applied to unusually short animal breeds.

intensifier is not in reduplicative form; I take it to be a crypto-compound ending
in a three-part reduplicative final. (355.b) is similar, but involves no
reduplication. In (355.c), the intensifier has interjection-like CvC form, though
in one case it can be reduplicated. ka@k is used in contexts like ‘he stopped still’
or ‘she stopped in her tracks’, emphasizing abrupt and total cessation of
movement.

"18.4 Restrictions on reflexives66118.4.3 No antecedent-reflexive relation between topic and coordinand
A topical NP does not induce reflexive possessor of a coordinand in the clause
proper. Therefore (1141) has simple 3Sg possessor wo$ (inalienable) rather than
Reflexive E$nE@ ma$. In other words, a topical NP does not count as “clause-mate
subject” for this purpose.

X and Y in the formulae below are understood to be other than first or second
pronouns.
Consider a construction [X VERB1 [Y VERB2 [ __’s Z]], using English
order to clarify grammatical relations, where VERB1 is a control verb taking a
subordinated clause with VERB2. In Jamsay, if the NP in the blank possessor
position is coindexed with either X (higher subject) or Y (clause-mate subject),
the possessor has reflexive form. This accounts for the ambiguity of (1142),
where E$nE@ may have either ‘Amadou’ or ‘my father’ as antecedent.

In a construction of the type [X VERB [Y VERB Z]], where Z is direct

In (1144), we see that the sense [X cause [Y to VERB [Y’s Z]]], expressed with
a single verb as [X Y [Y’s Z] VERB-Caus], does not allow Y to serve as
antecedent for a reflexive possessor. Therefore we get 3Sg possessor wo@ rather
than Reflexive E$nE@. In other words, the fact that Y is the (underlying) subject of
a clause does not count for purposes of antecedent determination in this case.

In (1144.b), if we substitute Reflexive [E$nE@ n)a&˘] for 3Sg possessor [wo@ n)a˘& ]
‘his meal’, Jamsay listeners infer that the meal belonged to the mother, see
(1145). That is, causative clause-union creates a structure with only the higher

The subordinated agent is expressed as an object pronominal in (1146.a),

$ i $w<e@ is positioned directly before the
verb in (1146.b), but before the object pronominal in (1146.a).18.4.6 3rd for 2nd person in quotation is not a reflexive antecedent
When an original utterance like ‘you want your nose’ is quoted, the subject is
expressed as 3rd person, e.g. 3Sg wo@ (§17.1.1). However, this “false” 3rd
person (understood to be a substitute for 2nd person) cannot serve as antecedent
for a reflexive possessor. Therefore ‘you want your nose’ is expressed as ‘3Sg
want 3Sg’s nose’ with no direct indication of coindexation. The Jamsay for
‘3Sg’s nose’ is [wo@ ci@r<E@]. See line 2 of (1267) for the relevant textual example.","[682, 683, 684, 685]"
"344Verbal inflectionThe “classic” perfective sense may be stretched, as in many languages, to
contexts where the speaker is firmly resolved to go into motion immediately,
cf. colloquial English I’m off or I’m out of here just prior to actual motion. An
example is (546).

[Logo Topic] [Logo Poss place] go-Perf-3SgS say
‘He said, “as for me [topic], I’m off to my place.”’ 2004.4.4The imperfective is used in connection with activities that extend beyond
the time of the speech event (i.e. present or future “tense”). It is also used with
reference to a displaced reference time, as in past-time narratives when a
durative activity is backgrounded to another event (‘they were working in the
field’), or to describe an event that post-dated the reference time (‘they were
going to go away’). The Past particle ji $˘< may be added to the end of the clause
in these contexts.
In simple conditionals, in the absence of a special temporal context the
antecedent clause has a perfective-system verb, while the consequent has an
imperfective verb. This applies both to hypothetical and to counterfactual
conditional constructions (§16.1). However, counterfactuals make use of Past
ji ˘$ < in both antecedent and consequent clauses.
Aspect is neutralized in many subordinated clause types. In verb (and VP)
chains, only the final verb has AN and pronominal-subject inflection (§15.1).
Some complement clauses are based on bare verb stems or Verbal Nouns,
which do not mark aspect, or on verb-based forms with their own unique
suffixes and/or tone overlays that cannot be identified with any specific mainclause AN category.","[365, 366]"

takes ‘how?’ rather than ‘what?’ as its interrogative complement.

‘How do they say?’ (=‘What do they call it?’) 2004.4.2013.2.2.6 ‘How much?’, ‘how many’ (a$˘Na@)
The interrogative noun a$˘Na@ may be predicative ‘be how much?’ (787.a). For
partitive ‘how much/many of NP’, a number of choices are available. When the
relevant NP is not the subject of a simple ‘how much/many?’ predicate, it may
precede a$˘Na@ (787.b-c) with its regular independent form (including normal
tones). This can be taken as apposition, exactly as with [noun+numeral]
combinations.
In combination with a plural pronoun (787.d), the partitive sense is stronger
(‘how many [of them]?’). In other words, a bounded set is understood, from
which a subset is selected. With a noun-headed NP, a partitive sense is most
clearly expressed by using a locative PP, e.g. with bE$rE^˘ ‘in’ or ga&nn$ ‘between,
among’ (787.e). The PP can be analysed as topical, as suggested by the free
translation of (787.e), and the pronoun in (787.d) is compatible with
topicalization as well (though it could also be interpreted as an alienable
possessor--unfortunately, 1Sg and 2Sg do not make sense in partitive contexts,
and these are the only two pronominals that have different forms for independent pronoun and possessor pronoun). A topicalized partitive also occurs
with a numeral in (374). The noun ‘kind, type’ combined with ‘how many?’ in
(787.f) makes the partitive semantics obvious, so no locative postposition is
needed. Nevertheless, the partitive NP is again topicalized, and it is resumed by
a pronoun (ko@).","[490, 491, 492, 493]"
"4.1.1Simple noun stems (Sg -n, Pl -m)Nonhuman nouns have no special morphology (unless they are compounds or
the like). Most human nouns other than kin terms take a Sg or Pl suffix (166), as
opposed to a separate Pl particle be@. The same suffixes are used with adjectives
(§4.5.1), and as Participial suffixes on verbs in relative clauses where agreement
is with the relative clause’s head (§14.1.8).

the unsuffixed form a$nsa@˘ra@ in singular or collective sense, as an alternative to
suffixed forms.

for adjectives, where the nonhuman form is always available to reveal the
lexical form of the unsuffixed stem. With the adjectives (§4.5, below), it is clear
that -n and -m have no tone marking of their own; instead, the tone of the final
syllable of the stem simply extends to the suffixal nasal.
I am aware of four suffix-taking bisyllabic noun stems that have a final
contour tone on a short vowel (168). All cases involve R-tone. The nasal suffix
is needed to permit expression of the second tone-component.

(168.a) have unsuffixed nonhuman counterparts: ç$ƒç@ ‘leader (e.g. of animal
pack)’, dç$ƒç@ ‘Dogon language’.
After a consonant-final stem, -n and -m acquire an initial vowel, usually i
with Sg -in and usually u with Pl -um, though there are some alternations
involving these high vowels. These extended variants are easily observed with
consonant-final adjectives, and arguably with a very small number of irregular
nouns (see just below).","[162, 163]"
"5.1.9Agentive compounds of type (x$ v@-Ppl)In this type of compound, there is a bare noun with overlaid stem-wide L-tone,
followed by a verb in participial form (Sg -n, Pl -m) but with stem-wide
H-tone. The formula is therefore [x$ v@-Ppl]. Segmentally, such agentives may be
indistinguishable from productive subject relatives with overt object (agentive
“Deerslayer” versus relative “one who slays deer”), but the tones are a failsafe
distinguishing factor, since in ordinary subject relatives the object NP has at
least one H-tone and the participle cannot be all-H tone.
Examples of agentives with non-cognate incorporated object (or similar
complement) are in (270). I transcribe them (unlike subject relatives) as single
words. The components are listed in parentheses with their lexical tones after
the free translation. This agentive type is usual in connection with occupations
or other regular activities that define human roles.

which can mean ‘child’ (of an adult animal) or just ‘juvenile (animal)’, ‘fruit’ or
‘seed’ (of plant), a small object paired with a larger object, a part of a two-part
or other complex object, or a diminutive version of a normally larger object.
There is ample room for semantic specialization for specific lexical items.
The initial always undergoes tone-dropping. When the initial ends in a
short vowel, VV-Contraction (90) may occur (275.a), but more often does not
(275.b). No contraction occurs after a long vowel (275.c). Of course there is no

19.1.3 ‘Also, even’ (ka^˘<, ka@r<a$)
The morpheme meaning ‘also, too’ (see below for ‘even’) is usually heard as
ka^˘<, which can easily be confused with the distributive quantifier ka^˘< ‘each,
any’. However, the particle meaning ‘also’ has a variant ka@r<a$ that is not shared
with the quantifier. In addition, the ‘each, any’ quantifier occurs in a more
limited set of morphosyntactic combinations, e.g. with a preceding unmodified
noun or a preceding relative clause, and it induces tone-dropping in the
preceding word (§6.1.4, §6.8.1). The ‘also, even’ particle occurs after a wide
range of phrases and clause-finally, and has no tonal effect on a preceding
word.
ka^˘< and ka@r<a$ variants are interchangeable. However, ka@r<a$ seems to
occur chiefly after a pronoun or other NP. ka^˘< is more common in all positions,
but seems especially dominant in clause-final position (with clausal scope), and
in the high-frequency combination ka^˘< nE$ with nE$ ‘now’. The variant ka@r<a$
should be distinguished from the common verb ka@r<a@- ‘do’, which appears as
the form ka@r<a$-Ø in perfective relative clauses with Nonhuman head NP.
For examples of ka^˘< in the sense ‘also, too’ see (217), (280.b), (435.c),
(556.a), (641), (671.b), (740.b), (749), (795.b), etc. For ka@r<a$ in this sense see
(315.b), (1152.a-b).
The constituent that the ‘also’ particle has scope over is not always topical,
but it may be (1152).

The mi@ ka@r<a$ ‘me too’ in (1152.b) was repeated in a parallel passage later

The sense ‘also’ is closely related to that of ‘even’, the only difference
being that ‘even’ presupposes the unlikelihood of one out of two (or more)
parallel events differing in at least one substantive component. The distinction is
made in English but not in Jamsay, where ka^˘< and ka@r<a$ may be translated
either way depending on context. The choice of translations is fairly arbitrary in
cases like ‘even today’ (= ‘today too’) following a discussion of past practices
(1153.a). The sense ‘even’ may be reinforced by ha^l ‘until, to the point that’

‘there are some who bear the burden of …’ 2004.3.2414.1.2 Coordinated and stacked (recursive) relatives.
A single overt head NP may occur in a construction involving two or more
relative clauses, i.e. in a conjoined relative of the type ‘the man [[who went
there] and [who took the horse]]’. (Of course this is distinct from conjunction of
two referentially distinct NPs with relatives: ‘[the man who came] and [the
woman who stayed]’).
In (805.a-c), there is no overt conjunctive particle linking the clauses, which
is to be expected since a) Jamsay relative clauses are morphosyntactically
nominal (participles have nominal suffixation), and b) conjunction of NPs in
Jamsay is generally expressed by juxtaposition without overt conjunctions
(§7.1.1). The head NP appears overtly once, in the first relative clause. One
might argue that a zeroed copy of the head NP is (virtually but not audibly)
present in the succeeding relative clauses. In a conjoined relative of this type,
the truth conditions of all of the relatives must be satisfied for the overall NP to484Relativizationrefer properly. In (805.a), the two relatives denote two propositions, one of
which (the negative second proposition) is entailed by the other. In (805.b), the
first relative denotes a primary action, while the second is a higher-level
proposition (‘of whom you are aware’). This example is also interesting in that
the (shared) head NP is the subject in one clause and the object in the other.

given several consecutive VP’s with a shared subject NP, the final VP contains
a participle while all the preceding VP’s are in chaining form (§14.1.15). This
alternative would work easily in (805.a), where the head NP is subject of both
clauses, but less easily in (805.b), where this is not the case.
A disjunctive relative clause of the same type is possible (806). The
disjuncts are followed by ma ‘or’ (§7.2).

‘the people who eat here or (who) drink here’One relative clause may be embedded within another (recursive or stacked
relatives). In this construction, the higher relative clause contains an NP (not the
higher head NP) that is itself expanded with a relative clause. The resulting
center-embedded construction is awkward in production and processing terms
and did not occur in my texts, but it is entirely grammatical and was readily
elicited. The left edge of the lower relative clause is normally marked
prosodically, as the preceding word shows prepausal prosody. This is most
often expressed by a brief pause, represented by a comma, since an intonationally determined terminal pitch drop might not be audible (the word in
question is often the final word of the higher head NP and is therefore already14.1 Basics of relative clauses485entirely L-toned). Such prosodic marking is useful in warning the listener that a
center-embedded construction is at hand, and is therefore helpful in preventing
misparsing. The right edge of the lower relative may also be marked prosodically in the same ways, but this is less systematic, since the right edge is in
most cases already clearly marked morphologically (e.g. by a participle, perhaps
with a following Definite morpheme or other NP-final element). Thus, in
(807.a), a$-n ‘man’ (word preceding the left edge of the lower relative) and
(optionally) Definite ku$< (final word in the lower relative, i.e. word preceding
the latter’s right edge) have prepausal prosody (final pitch drop and/or brief
pause). The formating in (807) indents the lower relative, and bolds the higher
and lower heads in the interlinears.

Relative clauses are most reliably identified by observing tone-dropping on the
final word in the head NP. This word would otherwise have at least one
H-tone, but it appears in relatives with all-L tones.
If the head NP (disregarding alienable possessors) consists of multiple
words, its nonfinal word(s) may already have become L-toned by tone-dropping
triggered by a following modifier (adjective or demonstrative). However, there
are some NP types that end in two (rarely more) words, each of which has at
least one H-tone. When such an NP functions as relative clause head, tonedropping applies simultaneously to the relevant words. The combinations in486Relativizationquestion are [noun + (cardinal) numeral] (§6.5), and inalienably possessed
nouns with nonpronominal possessor (§6.2.2).
The audible tone-dropping patterns for relative-clause heads are
summarized in (808). Please read the “key” underneath.

[noun.L - numeral.L]KEY: bolded underlined word undergoes audible tone-dropping
specifically due to relativization; bolded but not underlined word has
already undergone tone-dropping due to regular NP-internal rules;
italicized word (alienable possessor) retains its lexical tones.
Inalienably possessed nouns (with nonpronominal possessor NP) and
certain types of compounds have at least one H-tone in both the left and right
component when they occur NP-finally (more precisely, when they are not
followed by a modifying adjective or demonstrative). Examples include
compounds with final ba^˘< (ba@Na$) ‘owner’ or its plural na@m (§5.1.12). When
such an NP functions as relative head, the left and right components undergo
simultaneous tone-dropping.
Unless the entire head NP is omitted (“headless” relatives, see below), the
NP-final word targeted by relative-clause tone-dropping is either a noun or a
postnominal modifier. If there is a postnominal adjective and/or a postnominal
demonstrative (nu@No$ ‘that’), this postnominal modifier will have already forced
tone-dropping on the preceding word (a noun, or another postnominal
adjective). For example, an NP of the form [dog big that] is already expressed
as [dog.L big.L that] in main clauses, as each nonfinal word drops its tones
under the influence of the immediately following modifier. Therefore the only
change the NP undergoes as relative head is that the final word, here the
demonstrative ‘that’, also undergoes tone-dropping, resulting in [dog.L big.L
that.L].
Examples where just one word undergoes tone-dropping due to
relativization are in (809). These are cases where the NP (excluding alienable
possessors) does not end in two tonally independent elements.

(809.a) has a simple one-word head NP ‘thing’. In (809.b), the relevant NP
appears in main clauses as u$ro$ da@ƒa@ ‘small house’; the noun u@ro@ ‘house’ has
already dropped its tones because of the modifying adjective. When the NP
functions as relative head, the adjective also drops its tones. In (809.c-d), the
alienable possessor pronoun (ma@, ko@) is unaffected by the tone-dropping that
applies to the noun ‘house’.
In a [noun + numeral] sequence, in ordinary clauses both the noun and the
numeral have their lexical tones (tonal independence). When such an NP is head
of a relative, both the noun and numeral drop their tones (810).

when functioning as relative-clause heads: possessor plus inalienable noun such
as a kin term (811.a), compounds of type [x# n#] where neither the initial nor the
final changes its tones in a main clause (811.b), [x# n^] compounds where the488Relativizationfinal has an overlaid H(H…)L tone contour while the initial retains its lexical
tones (811.c), and compounds whose final is ba@Na$ (ba^˘<) ‘owner’ or its plural
counterpart na@m following a lexical-toned initial (811.d).
In (811.e), however, we have a combination including a numeral following
a kin term plus Pl be@. Normally be@ would appear after the participle. However,
in the combination be@ plus numeral, be@ is trapped inside the clause-internal
head NP. It does, however, resist tone-dropping, as does the following numeral,
although the preceding head noun and its inalienable possessor noun do undergo
tone-dropping.
The main-clause forms of the relevant NPs are given in parentheses after
the free translations.

(a@˘ma@du$ de^˘ be@ ku@ro@y)When a conjoined NP of the type [X Y], with both conjuncts ending in
the dying-quail intonation contour, occurs as head of a relative clause, there is a
conflict between preservation of this prolonged, falling intonation contour and
application of regular relative-head tone-dropping (which would force flat low
pitch). In elicited data, the dying-quail intonation was regularly maintained on
the left conjunct. The right conjunct usually (but not always) underwent tonedropping. See §7.1.1.5 for examples and discussion.","[504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510]"
"7.2.2NP (and adverbial) disjunction (ma)(427) illustrates the maximal type [[X ma] [Y ma]] with ma following
both disjuncts. Compare English either … or … constructions, and more

More often, there is only one disjunctive particle, located between the two
disjuncts. In the case of NPs, including those with numerals, and in the case of
adverbials, there is either no prosodic break between the disjuncts, or the
particle is grouped prosodically with the first disjunct. In either case, the particle
usually has exaggerated duration (symbol ) and may also show some
otherwise unexpected pitch rise ().
The seamless construction is exemplified in (428).

with quantitatively adjacent numerals (e.g. ‘four’ and ‘five’) represent a range
rather than a forced choice. In (431.a), note that the modified noun ‘month’ is
repeated. The fact that true conjunctions (‘X and Y’) are marked either by
dying-quail intonation or by final be@ in both conjuncts makes it easier to
interpret cases like (431), which lack these features, as disjunctions (‘X or Y’).
Compare also colloquial English three four months with no audible disjunction.

"480RelativizationWithin the relative-clause proper, the head NP remains in situ, i.e. it is not
systematically extracted to either the left or the right of (the rest of) the clause.
The head noun often happens to be clause-initial (disregarding topicalized
constituents), as is true of nonpronominal NPs in general, but it need not be so.
Relative clauses in Jamsay are not used for parenthetical comments, as in
English nonrestrictive relatives of the type I like John, who (by the way) is in
Texas right now.
Jamsay relatives may be definite or indefinite. If definite (‘the man whom I
saw’), they presuppose that the propositional content of the clause is true, and
known to the listener, often by virtue of preceding discourse. Since the content
is presupposed, there is a high propability that core NPs other than the
relativized NP itself will appear in pronominal form. Since pronominals (if not
topicalized or emphatic) occur in immediately preverbal position, this typically
results in clause-initial position for the (internal) head NP. Indefinite relatives
(‘a/any man who can climb this hill’) characterize an unidentified or generic
referent by the relevant proposition, which may include new nonpronominal
discourse referents, so in such relatives the head NP have no unusual
association with clause-initial position.
Some notable features of Jamsay relatives, in addition to the use of
participles and the arrangement of (internal and external) heads as outlined
above, are the use of preverbal L-toned subject pronominals in non-subject
relatives with no nonpronominal subject NP, and the application of a H(H…)L
tone overlay to unsuffixed Perfective verbs (which generally replace suffixed
positive Perfective verb forms).
Some important spatiotemporal and manner clauses are simply relative
clauses with a noun like ‘day’ or ‘place, manner’ as (overt or covert) head.
14.1.1 Relative clause with final ma$ plus repeated head noun
The maximal structure of a relative clause, with Nx representing the noun
functioning as lexical head within the internal head NP, and SP representing a
preverbal subject pronominal (allowed in non-subject relatives only), is (799).
(799)[[… [… Nx …]NP … (SP) Verb-Ppl] ma$ Nx]In this maximal version, the head noun Nx appears twice, once internally
within the internal head NP (which may also contain a possessor and/or a
postnominal modifier), and once externally (as an unmodified noun) after
Possessive ma$. While the redundant (ma$ Nx) portion is often omitted, there are
many textual examples like (800.a-e) where it does occur, and it is clearly an
authentic part of the relative-clause system.","[501, 502]"
"4.7.1.1‘One’, ‘same (one)’, and ‘other’The numeral ‘1’ is tu@ru@. This form is used in counting, and as a postnominal
modifier to denote a single unit (in an unmarked context, as in answering a
‘how many?’ question): u@ro@ tu@ru@ ‘one house’. Unlike other numerals, which do
not take -n and -m suffixes, tu@ru@ often takes (human) Sg suffix -n when
modifying a human noun: dç$ƒç&-n tu@ru@-n ‘one Dogon’. tu@ru@ is also used in the
iterated distributive tu@t-tu@ru@ (syncopated from /tu@ru@-tu@ru@/) ‘one by one, one at
a time’ (§4.7.1.6, below).
In the form tu@ru@, this numeral behaves like other numerals in requiring that
a preceding modified noun show its lexical tones. However, for paired body
parts (‘hand’, ‘foot’, ‘eye’, etc.), there is an alternative construction with
HL-toned tu@ru$ and all-L tone for the noun, as for nouns preceding ordinary
adjectives: E$nE@ ma$ nu$mo$ tu@ru$ ‘one of his hands (nu$mo@).
tu@ru@ is not generally also used in the fashion of French un(e) and English
a(n) or some as an indefinite article, e.g. to introduce a new discourse referent.
Likewise, informants rejected plural #tu@ru@-m ‘ones’, with or without a
preceding plural noun.
Another form, perhaps historically related to tu@ru@ in some way, is the
adjective tu@mno@, which can be glossed (in context) with preceding noun X as
‘(a) single X’, ‘(only) one X’, or ‘the same X’. Here the pragmatic nuance is
more emphatic, denying the possibility that a second X is relevant, or that the
original X has been replaced by another X.
The adjective ‘other’ is la$ƒa@. It can be used either in the sense of
‘additional’ (as in ‘I already own one house, and want to buy another’), or in the
sense ‘alternative’ (as in ‘I don’t like my current house, I’m going to sell it and
buy another one’). As a pragmatic sentence-adverb with no modified noun, la$ƒa@
is common in the sense ‘furthermore’ or ‘in addition’.
When a pair of entities or other nonsingular set has already been introduced
as a discourse referent, contrastive sequences of the type ‘one went, the other
(one) stayed here’ can be expressed by repeating the numeral ‘one’ in a
parallelistic construction (236).

pE@ru@The lexical R-tone of numerals ‘2-5’, though heard in isolation (238.a),
drops to L-tone in normal speech when the numeral is NP-final and follows a
noun or other head (238.b). The R-tone is still heard in careful pronunciation in
elicited examples. The modified noun preceding the numeral has its regular
tones; there is no tone-dropping before a cardinal numeral. If Definite ku$< is
added, the R-tone is generally audible even in modifying function (238.c).

suggests a syntactically appositional structure (§6.9). Further support for this
comes from the fact that when a [noun + numeral] combination is head of a
relative clause, the noun and the numeral undergo tone-dropping in parallel
(§14.1.3).","[205, 206, 207]"
"2.2 Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbs11Negation is also expressed by verbal suffixation; there are distinct Negative
suffixes for perfective and imperfective verbs, immediately preceding the
pronominal suffixes (hence verb-Neg-pronominal); see §10.1.3. Examples of
positive inflected verbs are in (3.a-b), followed by examples of negative
inflected verbs (3.c-d). Note the zero 3SgS suffix in (3.b).

§10.1.2. The division between the two systems is justified by semantics and
textual patterning. For example, the unsuffixed Perfective (in the syntactic
contexts that require it) may correspond to any of several marked perfectivesystem categories in other contexts, and the unsuffixed Imperfective is likewise
the unmarked, all-purpose imperfective-system form. Similar neutralizations
occur in negative AN categories.","[32, 33]"

The most puzzling textual example is (1094). Here we have the quotative

attached to another preceding clause (imperative or otherwise). I suggest it is
truncated from something like ‘…the place that you-Sg have told him to go in

interpolation.

17.6.6 ‘Because of’, ‘(more) than’, ‘a fortiori’ (so@go$n, so@go$)
so@go$n and so@go$ have at least some overlap in meaning.
Both can be used in the sense ‘because of’ with preceding NP. An
interrogative i n
$ )e@ so@go$ ‘because of what?’ = ‘why?’ is also attested, though it
competes with other ‘why?’ interrogatives (§13.2.2.2). /ko@ so@go$/ or more often
/ko@ ku$< so@go$/ with Nonhuman pronoun (in discourse-anaphoric function)
means ‘because of that; for that (reason)’ as in (1097); see also (207.a) in
§4.4.2.

quotations (stacked quotations). The data in (1121), below, were elicited. They
show that it is possible for a logophoric to be coindexed with either the higher
or lower antecedent. I framed the cues with singular and plural antecedents to
reduce any confusion about indexing in any given example.
In (1121.a), the ‘he’ in the lowest quoted clause is coindexed with Amadou,
the lower of two possible antecedents; either the regular 3Sg wo@ or Logophoric
E$nE@ may be used. In (1121.b), the logophoric ‘them’ in the lowest quoted clause
is coindexed with the higher antecedent ‘they’. These two examples, taken
together, show that logophorics are possible with antecedents one clause up or
two clauses up. In view of this, one might expect (1121.c) as at least an
alternative to (1121.b), with both ‘they’ and ‘Amadou’ binding logophoric
anaphors in the lowest quoted clause. However, my assistant rejected this
version. When the category of the pronoun coindexed with Amadou is made
explicit (as a clause-initial independent pronoun), my assistant gave it as wo@,
i.e., the regular (non-anaphoric) third singular pronoun (1121.d).
Overall, the data (which should be used with caution) suggest that a) the
highest antecedent readily binds a logophor regardless of depth of embedding,
b) a mid-level antecedent (not the highest quoted speaker) only optionally binds
a logophor, and c) the option to use a nonanaphoric third person pronominal is
especially favored when we would otherwise get two referentially disjoint
logophors in the same clause.

The use of a logophoric to replace an original first-person pronoun is part of
a broader shift in pronominal categories in reported speech. An original second
person pronominal is regularly converted into a (non-logophoric) third person
pronominal, unless this original second person corresponds to speaker or
addressee in the current speech event. For the larger picture, see the discussion
of “direct” and “indirect” discourse in §17.1.1.
18.2.2 Non-logophoric topic-indexing function (E$nE@, E$nE@ be@)
Once a discourse referent is established as a topical NP, a co-indexed Reflexive
pronoun (Sg E$nE@, Pl E$nE@ be@) may occur as subject of a following adverbial
clause or non-subject relative clause, or as possessor of the complement of an
adverbial PP that serves as background for a subsequent main clause. The term
“Reflexive” is not quite right for this indexing function, but for lack of a better
label I will use “Refl” in interlinears.
The adverbial PP type is illustrated in (1122). Such an adverbial phrase is
semantically equivalent to a background clause (e.g. ‘when it is young’).

2004.3.8
The adverbial-clause type is shown in (1123), with Reflexive pronominals
in subject function. (1123.b) also has an a second E$nE@ as Reflexive possessor
function, which is not directly relevant here. Another example is (214.a).

‘peoplex (=griots) who transform whomever theyx have followed

The emendation in (1124.c) is based on the plural participle (suffix -m); the
text is about a class of griots (a caste of bards) rather than about an individual.
The speaker’s slip is easily understood, since the initial i n
$ e$ ‘person’ is
unmarked for number, as often with relative heads. The embedded relative
clause ‘whomever they follow’ is headless; the full form would have another
in
$ e$ ‘person.L’ as head within the brackets: i $ne$ [i n
$ e$ E$nE@ be@ …].
The use of E$nE@ in this indexing function does not apply to non-subject
functions within clauses. For these non-subject functions, E$nE@ may only have
the clause-mate subject, not a preposed topic, as antecedent. Therefore we get
ordinary 3Sg wo@ rather than Reflexive E$nE@ in object function (1125.a) and as654Anaphorapossessor of subject (1125.b) or of object (1125.c), in spite of the preposed
coindexed topical NP.

In (1126), from a text about how children learn to hunt, the speaker appears
to “slip into” the E$nE@ form in a dative (referring to the generic child that has
been the topic of preceding discourse). The dative here is E&n le$, contracted from
E$nE@ le$. The speaker then interrupts himself, and repeats the phrase with the
regular 3Sg dative form wo$-ru@. The example suggests a latent tendency to
expand the use of E$nE@, but one that is subject to self-censorship.

E$nE@ is not regularly used for nonhuman referent. This restriction is again
borne out in the indexing construction, except e.g. in animal tales where person-18.2 Logophoric and indexing pronouns655ification is common. In (1127), the subject of the relative clause is coindexed
with the preceding topical NP ‘dog’, but we get an ordinary L-toned preverbal
Nonhuman subject pronominal ko$ instead of E$nE@. When I asked informants to
substitute a&-n ‘man’ for ‘dog’, I did get E$nE@ as relative-clause subject.

use this in the full range of functions for E$nE@ (e.g. reflexive possessor,
logophoric). For one of my Dianwely informants, i $ne@ appeared instead of E$nE@
in elicited examples. For another speaker, i n

Dogon groups have spread across the border into Burkina Faso. As a whole, the
family belongs to the vast Niger-Congo phylum, but its precise position relative
to other Niger-Congo families (e.g. Mande, Gur) is very unclear at this point.
The internal structure of the Dogon family is also very unclear, as is the number
of mutually unintelligible languages it contains.
The French colonial administration, having little interest in small native
languages, favored (macro-)ethnic over (precise) linguistic classification, hence
“Dogon” rather than e.g. “Jamsay,” and labeled linguistic varieties within each
such macro-ethnicity as “dialects,” a tradition maintained even in current
Francophone scholarship. For similar reasons, (macro-)ethnic classification
suits African governments fine. The official language policy in Mali, for
example, is to equate “language” with (macro-)ethnicity, select the linguistic
variety spoken in a particular focal community as standard, develop pedagogical
materials in this variety, and teach it as “mother tongue” to schoolchildren and
interested adults everywhere who belong to this ethnicity. In the case of Dogon,
the Toro-So variety of the Sanga area was chosen as standard Dogon and is the
basis of government-approved literacy efforts in the region.
Using the test of mutual unintelligibility as diagnostic, on the other hand,
there are clearly many distinct Dogon languages in Mali. We do not yet have
Dogon-wide data in a form that would permit demarcation of language
boundaries and accurate genetic subgroupings. However, having surveyed the
varieties spoken in the northern and northeastern parts of Dogon country, I can
report the following as distinct languages, using the towns of Dountza and Boni
(primarily Fulfulde-speaking) and Koro (Dogon and Mossi) as geographical
reference points:
1. Jamsay (aka Diamsay), see below;
2. Beni, spoken in Beni and Gamni south of Dianwely Maoudé, and in
Kumboy village hugging Fombori mountain between Beni and Douentza;
3. Walo, close genetically to Beni, spoken in Walo at the western end of the
long Gandamiya inselberg (on the opposite side of which is Kikara, where the
Songhay language Tondi Songway Kiini is spoken);
4. Nanga (naNa), spoken in a village cluster including Anda, Soroni,
Namakoro, Wakara, and Kono southwest of Beni and broadly east of the2 Introduction
Tommo-So (Tombo-So) speaking zone that begins at Kasa and extends to
Bandiagara;
5. Tabi-Sarinyere, spoken by the people sometimes called Tandam, east of the
town Boni (which is just off the highway, between Douentza and Hombori), in
several villages ringing the widely separated inselbergs of Tabi and Sarinyere,
plus a few small villages and one substantial one (Koyo) on the two inselbergs
framing Boni itself;
6. Najamba (= Bondu), spoken in a cluster of villages west and southwest of
Douentza including Koubewel, Adia.
After the initial failure of government-supported instruction in Toro-So in
Dogon villages of the Douentza-Boni zone, local groups have launched literacy
programs in Jamsay and Bondu and these are now being taught in primary
schools. Aside from its own mother-tongue villages, Jamsay is being taught in
the Tabi area (whose people have long known Jamsay as a second language,
since Mondoro is not far away). The children of Beni have been attending
school in Jamsay-speaking Dianwely Maoudé, where Jamsay is of course used,
pending the construction of its own school. Jamsay is slowly acquiring the
status of a locally dominant “standard” Dogon in the Douentza-Boni region.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"14.5 Possessor relative clause513There is no problem in forming human participles (with audible suffixes)
based on the negative ‘it is not’ construction, since here the Participial suffix is
added to Negative la$˘ (allomorph la$-) rather than directly to the ‘it is’ clitic.
Therefore in (858) ‘woman’ appears in tone-dropped form, as head of a relative
clause.

Possessor relatives are covered here, since their structure is relevant to the
discussion of relatives based on complex postpositions (§14.6.2, below).
Three constructions are possible for possessor relatives. In the first,
recorded once in a text, the possessor noun undergoes tone-dropping. Possessive
ma$ is not present. In (859), i n
$ e$ ga$sE$gE@ could be mistaken for a compound
(L-toned initial, lexical-toned final), but this would make no sense. Perhaps this
uncommon first construction is a slightly truncated version of the third (see
below). If so, i n
$ e$ and ga$sE$gE@ in (859) should be considered as two constituents
that just happen to be adjacent, rather than as constituting a single constituent
(possessed NP).

2004.4.25In the second construction, obtained in elicitation (see below), the regular
possessed NP phrase [X ma$ Y] ‘the Y of X’ is preserved intact, except that (as
relative head) the possessor X undergoes tone-dropping (860.a).
In the third construction, observed in a text and in elicitation (see below)
and evidently the productive pattern, the possessor is extracted (or at least
separated) from the possessed NP phrase and placed to its left (not necessarily
directly adjacent). This possessor NP (as relative head) undergoes tonedropping. Its original place within the possessed NP phrase is occupied by a
resumptive third person possessor (Singular, Plural, or Nonhuman) in its514Relativizationregular form (H-toned for alienable, L-toned for inalienable possession). The
resumptive pronominal is not Reflexive/Logophoric in form.
In elicitation, my assistant gave (860.a) and (860.b) as interchangeable.
(860.a) has the second construction with [X ma$ Y], while (860.b) illustrates the
more common third type showing extraction and a resumptive possessor
pronominal.

In this productive extraction construction, the possessed noun may be
separated from the possessor by an adverb (862.a) or by another NP (862.b). In
(862.a), the resumptive pronominal possessor is omitted, perhaps because in this
context ‘eye’ is an abstraction for ‘vision, ability to see’. In (862.b), my

14.6.1With simple postpositionIn PP relatives, only the NP complement of the postposition is logically
relativized on, as is brought out by English translations with stranded
prepositions (‘the housex that I live in __x’). However, in Jamsay, both the
postposition and the complement NP undergo tone-dropping. The usual
general features of relativization are also applicable: Participial suffix on the
verb agreeing with the head, preverbal L-toned subject pronominal, and
H(H…)L tone overlay on a (positive) unsuffixed Perfective verb.
The first set of examples (863) involve the all-purpose postposition le$
(§8.2.1). Since le$ is already L-toned, we cannot observe audible tone-dropping
on it, but tones are audibly dropped on the preceding noun (or noun modifier).

The alternative is a resumptive construction of the type ‘a thingx that poison

14.6.2 With complex PP of type [NP ma$ Postp]
Consider now what happens when the postposition is separated from its
complement NP by an intervening Possessive morpheme (ma$). This occurs
with a number of spatial postpositions that take complements in the form of
“possessors.”
In (866), an intervening ma$ does not prevent tone-dropping from applying
to both the complement NP ‘house’ and to the postposition ‘in’. Here, then, the
complex PP pattern [NP ma$ Postp] is treated exactly like the simple PP pattern
[NP Postp] discussed above.

taken as evidence that there are two distinct types of “complex PP,” both of the
form [NP ma$ Postp]. One type, e.g. with bE$rE^˘ ‘in’ and the other postpositions
illustrated in (866), behaves syntactically like a simple PP. The other, my only
clear example being ku^˘<, behaves like a possessed NP phrase. This in turn
suggests that ku^˘<, but not bE$rE^˘ et al., is still treated synchronically as a
denominal tonal locative (§8.1), and therefore as itself a kind of mini-PP.
Textual examples where ku^˘< can plausibly be glossed concretely as ‘on the
head of’ (as in ‘it fell on me’) provide additional evidence that ku^˘< is still
closely connected by native speakers to the source noun ku@˘< ‘head’. The
synchronic connection between bE$rE^˘ ‘in’ and the original source noun bE$rE@
‘belly’ seems weaker.
This reasoning leads to an analysis of [X ma$ ku^˘<] ‘on NP’ as structurally
[[X Poss head]-Loc], i.e., ‘on X’s head’. Here the NP complement X functions
as possessor of ‘head’, not (directly) as complement of the Locative postposition. We have seen in §14.5, above, that in one attested construction, a14.6 PP relative clause519relativized possessor remains in place and simply drops its tones, with no
change in the possessed noun. This is consistent with the tone-dropping pattern
in ‘what she will sit (=live) on’ in (867.a), above.
Parallel to ‘on the head of’ (867), above, is (868), where the “postposition”
is overtly a PP on its own.

Def15 Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clausesThe first part of this chapter (§15.1) is about chaining VPs (or verbs) together.
The second part (§15.2) is about various explicitly adverbial clauses, chiefly
those that specify temporal relations. Some of these are special cases of relative
clauses, including an important type (“headless” relatives) with a virtual head
NP that takes Nonhuman participial agreement on the verb (§15.2.7). The
chapter concludes with a brief section (§15.3) on special cases of Possessive
ma$.
15.1 Chaining
The term “chaining” will be used for combinations of VPs (sometimes reduced
to simple verbs), such that the nonfinal verbs occur in infinitival (=bare stem)
form with their lexical tone, which depending on the verb is either all-H or
L(L…)H. The VPs in question have a shared subject, which facilitates the
reduction of one clause to just a VP. The final verb in a chain is inflected for
aspect-negation categories, and usually for subject pronominal category.
Chaining covers a range of phenomena involving various degrees of
integration. At one extreme, we have two or more completely separate VPs
chained together, sharing a subject and implying some sort of temporal or
causal relationships, but with no other formal clause-level integration. At the
other extreme, we have a kind of verb-verb compounding, where a pair of verbs
functions like a single verb, with a single set of arguments and adverbial complements.
Closely related to VP-chaining in form and function is a VP-linking
construction with particle me$y< (§15.1.14, below). There is also a similarity to
constructions with main-clause verbs like ‘want’ that take complements in the
form of VPs ending in bare stems (§17.5).
15.1.1 Tone-dropping of medial chained verb (v# v$ v#)
When three (or more) verbs are chained together without separating material, a
verb in the middle of the chain optionally appears in L-toned form (869). In
(869.c), if the linker ti@ (§15.1.16) is considered to be a verb there are four verbs
in the chain, and the two medial ones including ti@ drop their tones..","[534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542]"

construction (§15.2.4.2).
Postposition le$ is not used with pronominals, except for the Logophoric
singular pronoun (chiefly in dative function): E$nE@ le$ ‘to him/her-Logo’. Other
pronominals have a special set of forms ending in -n@ or -ru@ in dative function
(and for the Nonhuman pronoun, also in locative and instrumental functions);

"4.2.7Iteration with vocalic shift (to$˘No$-ta@˘Na@)In the triple iterations (x-x-x) of the preceding section, the medial occurrence
shifts to a-vocalism (ko$ro@-ka$ra$-ko$ro@, kE@˘-ka$˘-kE@˘, wu$˘-wa$˘-wu^˘). A similar
pattern is observed in a few simple (two-part) iterations. Adverbial examples:

@ a@y< ‘walking
stiffly’. Onomatopoeic noun: pu$˘-pa@˘ ‘(a) bellows’.
Most simple nominal and adverbial iterations preserve the vocalism of the
base: bE$lE$-bE@lE$ ‘shepherd’s hat’, jE$gi@ jE$gi@ ‘walking with a tilt’ (adverb).
4.3Pronouns4.3.1Basic personal pronounsThe basic personal pronouns are those in (191). “3Sg” and “3Pl” denote
specifically human third person categories, versus the Nonh[uman] pronoun
(which is closely related to a demonstrative). For an alternative yE@ to the regular
3rd person preverbal subject pronoun, see §4.3.3, below. For 3rd person156Nominal, pronominal, and adjectival morphologyreflexive and logophoric pronouns (Sg E$nE@, Pl E$nE@ be@), which pattern
morphologically like nouns, see §18.1-2.

in verbal inflection, the 3Sg subject suffix -Ø agrees with human or nonhuman
referents. The exception is that in the (positive) unsuffixed Imperfective,
nonhuman subject is expressed by adding cliticized kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’ to the
verb stem (§10.1.2.8, §10.2.2).
The independent form, arguably basic morphologically, is used
independently, for direct object (always preverbal), complement of postposition
(other than dative), and possessor of ordinary (alienable) noun. All independent
pronominals are high-toned.
Subject category is expressed either by an inflectional suffix (the [Verb-_ ]
column) or by a preverbal pronoun (the [ _Verb] column). With rare
exceptions (§10.2.2), the two do not co-occur. The preverbal pronoun occurs in
relatives and some other subordinated clauses. The suffixed pronominal occurs
in ordinary main clauses, except that subject-focus constructions (which have a
focused subject pronoun or noun, usually at the beginning of the clause) have no
suffix.
The (unfocalized) preverbal subject forms in (191) are segmentally identical
to independents, except that the tone is dropped to L. The preverbal subject
pronominals are therefore identical to the prenominal inalienable possessor
pronominals (rightmost column). The pronominal-subject suffixes are at best
loosely related to any of the other pronominal series. Note in particular that the
nonsuffixal 3Pl forms are all be@ (or L-toned be$) versus 2Pl e@ (or e$), but in the
pronominal-subject suffixes -be is 2Pl, while 3Pl is expressed as -ba (reducing
to -e or -a after a Negative suffix). For more on the subject suffixes, see §10.2.","[177, 178]"
"Given the Constraint Against All-L-Toned Stems (99), one could consider the
possibility that one or another of the attested lexical tone patterns is a default,
applied to underlying L-toned stems in order to satisfy the constraint. I do not
favor this (pure) constraint-satisfaction model, but if I did I would suggest finalmora H-tone as the default. In this view, which I will call the default-finalmora-H analysis, verbs with (monosyllabic) R, bisyllabic LH, trisyllabic LLH,
and so forth, are reinterpreted as having no lexical H-tone, with the final mora
secondarily acquiring H-tone to satisfy the constraint. The same would apply to
nouns, adjectives, and numerals that have L-tone up to a final H-toned mora.
Possible evidence for this applicability of the default-final-mora-H
approach to nouns is provided by a small numer of human nouns that normally
(and in some cases exclusively) occur with Sg -n or Pl -m. The stems in
question have a final R-tone in these suffixed forms, and the suffixal nasal is
required to permit expression of the H-tone component of R (i.e., <LH>). The
four known examples are ç$ƒç&-n ‘chief, Hogon’, sa$ƒa&-n ‘chief’s subordinate’,
dç$ƒç&-n ‘Dogon (person)’, and su$rgç&-n ‘weaver’ (plurals ç$ƒç&-m, sa$ƒa&-m,
dç$ƒç&-m, su$rgç&-m). ‘Chief’ has an unsuffixed form ç$ƒç@ ‘leader (e.g. of animal
pack)’, with final H-tone replacing R-tone, and ‘Dogon’ has an unsuffixed form
dç$ƒç@ meaning ‘Dogon language’, while ‘chief’s subordinate’ and ‘weaver’ do
not occur without suffixes. In the default-final-mora-H analysis, these stems are
underlying all-L /ç$ƒç$/, /sa$ƒa$/ , /dç$ƒç$/, and /su$rgç$/, and the final mora secondarily acquires H-tone, for example in unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ and in suffixed ç$ƒç&-n.
A theoretical objection to this argument is that e.g. unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ ‘leader’
can also be derived from /ç$ƒç&/ by a simple tone rule converting R to H tone on a
final monomoraic syllable; see Final-Cv R-to-H Reduction (154), §3.7.4.6,
below.
Additional grist for this debate comes from tonal relationships between
underived and suffixally derived stems; see below, §3.7.3.1.
In the sections that follow, I will suggest an autosegmental model for
Jamsay tone, while acknowledging the existence of a few counterexamples to
the rules proposed. In its strongest form, an autosegmental model of tone
separates the segmental tier from the tonal tier. Strictly speaking, the segmental tier must itself be organized into syllables, moras, and feet, but since
these are derivable from the segment string I will speak loosely of these as
elements of the segmental tier.
A stem, or a word, consists of non-null strings of segments and of tonecomponents. Curly brackets {…} will be used for strings of H and L components at stem or word level. For example, u@ro@ ‘house’ consists of uro at the
segmental level and {H} at the autosegmental level, while its tonal locative u@ro$3.7 Tones97‘at the house’ has the same segments but a bitonal {HL} tone pattern. Both the
segmental and tonal tiers may be morphemically complex.
For this model to work perfectly, there must be rigorous association
processes that connect the tone components H and L to the correct syllables
and/or moras. These processes are easy to formulate when the tonal tier is
monotonal, i.e. just {H}, since of course in this case the H component will
associate to all syllables (and moras) at the segmental level; i.e., it will spread
throughout the stem or word. The rules are also easy to formulate when the
number of tone components, the number of syllables, and the number of moras
all converge, for example bitonal {LH} for a CvCv stem. Complications arise
with bi- or trimoraic syllables, since now the association rules must decide
whether to associate tone components with syllables or with moras. The
challenges increase to the extent that the number of tone components is mismatched with the number of relevant segmental-tier units (syllables or moras).
For Jamsay, no pure autosegmental model will work perfectly for all wordclasses. However, it is possible to develop a model that works well for verbs,
and that helps explain statistically important patterns for nouns.","[118, 119]"
"13 Focalization and interrogation13.1 Focalization
Focalization is a fundamental process in Jamsay morphosyntax, but it is
somewhat elusive. In the usual case, an NP or adverbial is highlighted
(focused), whereupon the remainder of the clause and in particular the verb is
automatically defocalized. I distinguish a marked focalization construction
from an unmarked one, based on the form of the highlighted constituent itself.
In both marked and unmarked constructions, verbs in the perfective positive
appear in the unsuffixed Perfective form, with stem-wide L-tone, rather than in
a form with overt Perfective suffix. Perfective Negative and the Imperfective
Negative verbs also show stem-wide L-tone (including the AN suffix) in
focalization constructions. This tone-dropping may be interpreted iconically as
a prosodic manifestation of verb defocalization. No tone-dropping applies to
the unmarked Imperfective, or to any verb with overt positive AN suffixation.
In subject focalization, there is no pronominal-subject suffix on the verb
(the subject is always expressed overtly earlier in the sentence). In all types of
non-subject focalization, the usual pronominal-subject suffix appears on the
verb.
In the marked construction, in addition to the aforementioned defocalization of perfective verbs, the focalized constituent hosts the Focus clitic y$,
or its allomorph i $˘ (sometimes i^˘ after tone sandhi). This clitic is also added
to NPs and other constituents in the ‘it is’ (i.e., copula) construction (§11.2.1).
As a result, the marked focalization construction resembles English clefts of the
type ‘it’s you (e.g. not that other woman) that I love’.
In the unmarked construction, we get the verb defocalization described
above, and there is a focal constituent (e.g. ci@n ‘like that’), but the latter is not
overtly marked with the clitic y$.
Since verb defocalization has audible effects on the stem only with perfective and negative verbs, and since the 3Sg pronominal-subject suffix is -Ø,
the unmarked focalization construction is indistinguishable from unfocalized
clauses when the verb is imperfective positive and the subject is 3Sg.
Quite often in Jamsay discourse, a topic is presented first, followed by
sentence containing a pronominalized or otherwise reduced variant thereof in
focalized form. Schematic examples to give the flavor of this strategy: a) ‘meat,
that’s what I like’, b) ‘we sow seeds early, that’s how we farm’. Real examples
are in (744). In (744.a), the parallel segments are aligned. Note the absence of13.1 Focalization455pronominal-subject marking (3Pl -ba$) on the defocalized verbs in the subjectfocus example (744.a), and the presence of a pronominal-subject suffix (1Sg
-m) in the non-subject-focus example (744.b).

Although Focus clitic y$ is, to all appearances, morphologically identical to the

ungrammaticality of English #It’s meat [focus] that it is, in contrast to the
grammatical Meat [focus] is what it is. In (745), the focused constituent is the
complement of the preposition ‘in’. The entire PP is the complement of the
external y$ ‘it is/was’. The construction is rare, but my assistant found it
grammatical.

In subject focalization, there is no subject pronominal suffix on the verb.
There is also no participial suffix of the sort found in relative clauses. This lack
of suffixation is a useful diagnostic, except for 3Sg subject which has -Ø suffix
anyway. The subject X is always overtly expressed earlier in the clause, either
as unmarked [X] or in the form [Xy$] with the Focus clitic. If the subject is
pronominal, it appears in preverbal position in its H-toned independent form,456Focalization and interrogationwith or without Focus y$. A perfective (positive) verb takes the L-toned

"10.2.2 Nonhuman versus 3Sg subject
Cliticized quasi-verb kç$ ‘be.Nonh’ is added to the unsuffixed Imperfective to
index a Nonhuman subject. The L-tone segment that marks Imperfective,
underlyingly located between the stem proper and the kç$, is realized on the
kç$ (i.e. it merges with the already low tone of the clitic). Thus mi@ cE@rE@kç$ ‘it
will bite me’ from /cE@rE@-Lkç$/, see Tone-Grafting (131).
kç$ is syntactically and morphologically verblike rather than a typical
pronominal suffix. Whereas the human subject pronominal suffixes are replaced
by preverbal subject pronominals in relative clauses, kç$ remains in postverbal
position in relatives, and Participial suffixes are added to it rather than to the
preceding verb (§14.1.9).
kç$ is absent after verbs in AN categories (including Imperfective
Negative) other than the unsuffixed Imperfective (positive). In the other AN
categories, Nonhuman subject is with 3Sg subject as zero: Perfective (ya&˘-yE$-Ø
‘He/She/It went’, mi@ cE@t-ti $-Ø ‘He/She/It bit me’), Resultative -sa$- (mi@ E@˘-sa$-Ø
‘He/She/It saw me’), -jE$- (n)E˘@ -jE$-Ø ‘He/She/It already ate’), -tE@rE$- (mi@
cE@t-tE@rE$-Ø ‘He/She/It once bit me’), Perfective negative (mi@ cE$l-li@-Ø
‘He/She/It didn’t bite me’), Imperfective Negative (mi@ cE$rE$-go@-Ø ‘He/She/It
won’t bite me’), Habitual (mi@ cE$r-a@˘ra$-Ø ‘He/She/It bites me’), or marked
Imperfective (mi@ cE@t-tç@ƒç$-Ø ‘He/She/It bites me’). In interlinears, I gloss the
zero suffix as “3SgS,” though “3SgS/Nonh” would be more accurate.
Occasionally there is an preverbal 3rd person or Nonhuman pronoun,
apparently in subject function. In the type exemplified by (589.a), the verb
na@˘-y<E$-Ø might easily be taken as ending in 3Sg subject -Ø, which makes one
wonder why there is also a preverbal L-toned subject pronominal wo$. This is
actually a participial construction, with Nonhuman Participial -Ø indexing an
unexpressed nonhuman head (with a meaning like ‘time’ or ‘situation’).
Therefore it is appropriate for the (non-head) subject to be expressed by an
L-toned pronominal; see (974) and discussion there. In the common expression
(589.b), kç$˘-rç@ ‘it is not (present)’ is already marked for nonhuman subject, so
the preceding H-toned ko@ is redundant. One could argue that the ko@ is topical.",[394]
"656Anaphora18.3 Reciprocal
18.3.1 Simple reciprocals (tç^˘-n, tç^˘-m)
Reciprocal is expressed by the noun tç^˘-n (Singular) or tç^˘-m (Plural). The
Singular form is required when there are just two entities involved. When three
or more are involved, either the Singular or the Plural may be used. To the
extent that the Pl form is used when a minimum of three entities (e.g. speaker
and two other persons) is involved, the choice of grammatical number is based
on the perspective of one of the participants (‘me and the other one’ versus
‘me and the other ones’).
These Reciprocal pronouns are related to a noun meaning ‘comrade,
colleague’, which has the forms in (1129). Human suffixes occur only in the
presence of an overt possessor, as with some inalienable kin terms (§6.2.2). The
possessed forms may be treated as alienable, e.g. ma@ tç@w<ç@-n ‘my comrade’, or
inalienable, e.g. mi $ tç^˘-n ‘my comrade’ (§6.2.1-2). The F-tone in tç^˘-n is
compatible with the overlaid H(H…)L tone of inalienably possessed kin terms.

In (1133), a party of young men seeking to cross the desert and clandestinely
enter Europe encounter another group with the same intention. Since tç^˘-m is
not a reciprocal here in the ordinary sense, I gloss it in its lexical sense
‘comrade(s)’, though the comradeship in question is rather attenuated (‘fellow

In this section I consider interrogative complements to main-clause verbs like
‘know’, as in ‘I don’t know (whether/who/what …)’.
An embedded polar interrogative clause (‘whether or not …’) is a simple
quotative complement (§17.1), plus the usual clause-final interrogative particle
ma. The particle distinguishes an embedded interrogative (‘I didn’t know
whether …’) from a factive complement (‘I didn’t know that …’), although the
Jamsay embedded interrogative construction may be used (as complement of
‘know’) where English would use the factive complement. Examples are in
(795).

where English speakers would use a factive complement. This is the case in
(796.a), above, which would more naturally be expressed as ‘… who knows that
it was I …’ in a free English translation.
Embedded WH interrogatives may be of two types. In one, the regular
WH-word is used, with optional clause-final interrogative particle ma. This
type approximates direct discourse, except for deictic substitutions such as
logophoric pronominals, where appropriate (797).

‘I don’t know how much they paid.’This type, with the regular WH-word, is preferred for embedded ‘how
much?’ and for embedded ‘who?’. In the first case, this may be for lack of a
suitable nominal counterpart (‘amount’, ‘quantity’). In the second, the
preference may be due to avoidance of ambiguity between e.g. ‘I don’t know
who lives here’ (identificational knowledge) versus ‘I don’t know the person
who lives here’ (acquaintance).
The second possibility for embedded WH interrogatives is the literal type
exemplified by “I don’t know the place in which he is” as the translation of
English ‘I don’t know where he is.’ That is, a generic noun like ‘place’, ‘time’,
‘manner’, or ‘thing’ is the head of a relative clause, which (as a syntactic NP)
functions as direct object of ‘know’ or other main-clause verb. There is no overt
interrogative element.","[497, 498, 499]"

2004.3.1715.1.4 Presence of AN suffix in nonfinal chained verb
While most nonfinal verbs in chains are morphologically bare, there are
infrequent examples in texts of chained verbs with an AN suffix (but, by
definition, without a pronominal-subject or Participial suffix). I include here
both direct chaining, and chaining with intervening me$y<. The AN categories in15.1 Chaining523question are Recent Perfect -jE$ indicating a chronological sequencing among
the chained verbs in (873.a-b) and (939.d), and Imperfective -tç@ƒç$ indicating
extended time overlap (873.b). If the Linker ti@ (§15.1.16) is equated with
Perfective suffix -ti -$ , many additional examples can be recognized.

A typical example extracted from a still longer chain is (874). Here each verb
(‘sling over shoulder’, ‘go’) is preceded by the arguments logically associated
with it. One can therefore easily bracket the VPs including their complements.

[[Refl Poss rifle]

‘Having slung his rifle over his shoulder, and having gone to Douentza,
…’ 2004.3.4(875) shows how chaining can produce compact utterances, with a single
NP (e.g. direct object) being simultaneously governed by several verbs, only
the last of which is in fully inflected form (with AN marking and a pronominalsubject suffix).

with Ø (and Øx in interlinears) indicating the approximate syntactic positions
where the shared direct object NP (‘manure’) or pronoun (‘it’ = cattle) could

‘The men will tie up one bundle (of millet), put it on a cart, get together

have been uttered. A complement such as a direct object may likewise be
omitted during the first one or two VPs, then appear overtly before a noninitial
(perhaps the final) verb of which it is a logical argument. In (877), note that
Nonhuman object pronominal ko@ is repeated (lines 1 and 4).
In (878), ‘milk’ is the logical object of ‘bring’, ‘put’, and ‘sell’, but it does
not appear until just before the final verb ‘sell’. This contrasts with e.g. (876.a),
above, where the direct object appears in the first eligible VP and is not
repeated.

In (879.a) a$na@ ‘village’, here in locative adverbial function, is more
naturally associated with ‘go around’ than with ‘blow (horn)’. However, it is
placed to the left of the two-verb sequence. In (879.b), the dative pronominal is
properly the argument of the second verb ‘speak’, but it is placed before the first
verb ‘go’. (879.c) has a similar structure, with ‘give’. These examples suggest
that two VPs in a chain have coalesced into one.

dative (=indirect) object of ‘show’. The speaker could therefore have used two
1Pl pronominals, an object form before ‘take’ and a dative form before ‘show’.
Instead, he used only the object form before ‘take’, correctly assuming that the
context was sufficiently clear. ‘Show’, like ‘give’, often omits an expected
Nonhuman direct object pronominal.

In some cases, the meanings of two chained verbs may blend together,
constituting the verbal equivalent of compounds.
One pair of examples, both involving kç@l-lç@- (Reversive derivative of kç@rç@‘hang up, hook’), is in (881). Here the second verb, ‘bring’ or ‘leave (in place)’,526Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clausesclarifies the sense of the first verb as well as specifying motion (or lack thereof).
In one case, the suspended object is to be unhooked (and then brought). In the
other, the object has already been unhooked and is to be re-hung (and left
there); the logical sequence [unhook-(re)hang-leave] is boiled down to [unhookleave].
