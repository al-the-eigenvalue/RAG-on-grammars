"287According to Givén (1984:138), Subject would be the grammaticalized
discursive-pragmatic role of topic; that is, Subject would be the codification of the
primary clausal topic, while Object would be the codification of the secondary clausal
topic.
The codification of the primary clausal topic - the Subject - is done through
several devices, such as word order, verb agreement, nominal case-morphology, etc.
Looking at these coding devices, we could identify the category of Subject in a specific
language.
Among the coding devices proposed by Keenan (1976), we have:
eword ordereverb agreement (i.e. the Subject controls person-marking on the verb)enominal case-morphology (in general, the Subject receives the unmarked case)ebehavior-and-control properties (such as control of coreference; reflexivization;
control of coreference in relativization, etc.)eindispensability (the Subject is the NP necessarily present in a clause. All clauses
have a Subject)eagentivity (the agent often is the topical participant)eaddressee phrase of the Imperative constructionThe coding properties presented above work very well for identifying the Subject
of languages whose case system is Nominative-Accusative. For these languages, the
properties coincide in a way that results in a coherent notion of Subject: S and A, which
are “‘...the NPs which refer to functions that can be the initiating/controlling agents”288(Dixon 1994:124-125), aligned both in morphology and in syntax. Therefore, for these
languages, Subject would be the grouping {S, A}.
The scenario is more complex when we use the same properties for identifying the
Subject of languages whose case system is Ergative-Absolutive, because the
morphological properties and the behavior-and-control properties can conflict. Many
languages are Ergative in the morphology (with S and O aligning), but their syntax works
on a Nominative-Accusative basis (i.e. for syntactic operations, S and A align). Then,
how do we define the category of Subject for these languages? Which coding property is
more crucial for characterizing their Subject?
Other Ergative languages have a consistent system, being Ergative-Absolutive
both in morphology and syntax (these languages have “deep ergativity”). For languages of
this type, some authors propose that the Absolutive NP would be the Subject; Keenan
(1976) suggests this with regard to Dyirbal. Dixon (1994:112) does not agree with this
analysis, because if the Absolutive is the Subject, then the category of Subject in Dyirbal
would be the grouping {S,O}; however, there are semantic differences between S and O.
The grouping {S,A} as ‘Subject’ is understandable because, as Dixon points out, S and A
refer to functions that can be the agent. In contrast, the grouping {S,O} as ‘Subject’ is
problematic because O is not semantically an agent, it is a patient.'* Therefore, to say that
the Absolutive is the Subject of a language with deep ergativity - such as Dyirbal - may
not be the best analysis. However, if in a language with deep ergativity S and A do not‘4 The discussion presented here is especially concerned about clauses in the active voice. If we have a
Transitive clause with two arguments, A and O, which one will be the ‘Subject’ of the clause?","[314, 315, 316]"
"These markers are also lexically conditioned and, in the case of -os and -us, it
might be that they actually represent dialectal variation, corresponding to -es or -as in the
speech of other Trumai speakers (the use of -is seems to be more consistent among the
consultants). This point will be better investigated in the future.
What about the difference among -(V)tl ‘Dative’ , -ki ‘Dative’ and -(V)s
‘Dative’? As already seen in the examples (21-23), these 3 enclitics modify dative NPs.
The choice of the dative markers depends on the semantic characteristics of the NP:
person (1, 2, 3); number (singular, dual, plural), animacy (human, non-human animate,inanimate); whether the head is a possessed or unpossessed noun. Some kinds of NPs74have one possible choice (e.g. 1st and 2nd person pronouns), while others have two (e.g.
3rd SG pronouns; human SG nouns). For the cases where two choices are available,pragmatic factors (such as the degree of identification of the entity) play a role. Tables

complement. The selection of dative marker for the complements of Extended Intransitive
verbs is also based on both the semantic and pragmatic characteristics of the NPs.","[99, 100]"
"254CHAPTER 7Case-Marking Alignment
and Grammatical RelationsIn this chapter, the case system of Trumai is described. The alignments observed
in the data show that this language has an Ergative-Absolutive system, and that there are
four verb classes in Trumai. This language has three kinds of obligatory arguments
(Ergative, Absolutive, Dative) and these argument types are very important in describing
the system of the language. The traditional grammatical relations (Subject, Object,
Indirect Object) do not play a central role in Trumai grammar. There are no syntactic
behaviors that support establishing a cross-cutting category of either ‘Subject’ (grouping
A and S) or ‘Object’ (grouping O and DAT). It seems that this language works on the
basis of another principle: ‘Core’ versus ‘Peripheral’ arguments, with different degrees of
core/peripheriality.
Section 7.1. presents the clause types and the verbal classes found in Trumai, with
characterization of the case system. There is a special discussion with regard to one
verbal class, the Extended Intransitive verbs (section 7.1.3).","[281, 282]"
"Trumai has rich syntax, although word order can change because of pragmatic
factors. The case-system shows an Ergative-Absolutive alignment. With regard to
grammatical relations, the traditional relations of ‘Subject’, ‘Object’, and ‘Indirect
Object’ do not play a central role in Trumai grammar. The case-marking system and the
syntax of the language consistently identify three argument types: Absolutive, Ergative,
and Dative; each type contains a subset of the traditional relations.
Other interesting facts observed in Trumai: (i) when a Transitive verb iscausativized, both the causer and the causee are marked as Ergative; (11) the main strategy
for voice manipulation is argument suppression; (iii) there is a construction that could be
classified as an instance of “possessor ascension”; (iv) the verb of a complement clause
behaves as an inalienably possessed noun (more specifically, as a body part term); (v)
there are multiple types of negative clauses in Trumai.","[5, 6]"
"Foc/Tens217The possession of alienable entities involves a special kind of clause: the word
k’ad, which literally means ‘hand’, behaves as the verb of the clause (and probably means
‘to have’ here), and both the NP-possessor and the NP-possessed occur in the Absolutive
case, which is a pattern completely different from those observed elsewhere in the
language.’ In a verbal predicate, when one of the NPs is in the absolutive case, the others
are in the ergative, dative or remaining cases. However, here two NPs are both in the
Absolutive; case marking is not allowed in the NP-possessed (examples 123b-c). In this
case, how do we distinguish the possessor from the possessed? The possessor is the NP
that comes right before the verb k’ad (120), or right before the copula when there are
changes in the word order (121). When the possessor is not lexically realized, the 3Abs
enclitic occurs on the verb k’ad (example 122). As we can see, the possessor has thesyntactic attributes of an S argument (cf. chapter 7). Examples:
(120)(121)tahu ka_in
ha k’ad.

knife[possessor marked in the verb k’ad]27 Given that the verb k’ad probably came from the noun k’ad ‘hand’, we could imagine that the
construction perhaps has evolved from something like [my hand is in/with a knife] to [I hold a knife] and
finally [I have a knife]. Later, the possessive pronoun for ‘my’ was probably reanalyzed as a subject
personal pronoun ‘I’, and the word for ‘hand’ was reanalyzed as verb (probably following the path:
grasp/hold> have; the common evolution observed in some languages is hand>grasp>hold>have, like in
French). This is merely speculation, since there is no direct evidence for this hypothesis, but the evolution
grasp>have is widely attested cross-linguistically, and the connection between ‘hand’ and ‘grasp’ should be
uncontroversial.","[242, 243]"
"712.3. Postpositions and case markersAs already mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, a noun phrase in Trumai
can be followed by phrasal enclitics that indicate its grammatical case (these enclitics will
be called ‘case markers’) or postpositions. Let us analyze these elements in more detail.
The case markers are -ak /-ek /-k ‘Ergative’ , -atl /-etl / -tl ‘Dative’, -ki ‘Dative’,-as /-es |-s ‘Dative’, -an/-en/-n ‘Locative’”>, and -kate/-kte ‘Genitive’. The allomorphs
with vowels attach to words ending in consonants, while the other one attaches to words
ending in vowels. The variation between the allomorphs with the vowel /e/ (the
‘Ergative’ enclitic -ek and the Dative enclitics -erl and -es) and the allomorphs with the
vowel /a/ (-ak ‘Ergative’, -atl ‘Dative’, -as ‘Dative’) seems to be lexically rather than
semantically or phonologically conditioned, since:
eit is not the semantics of the head noun that matters, because two NPs can have the
same head and still receive different markers (e.g.","[96, 97]"
"16CHAPTER 2
Nouns and Noun PhrasesOne of the main characteristics of Trumai is that it is basically an isolating
language. There are not many inflectional morphemes and in general words consist of a
single morpheme. The Trumai word classes are: nouns (including pronouns and
demonstratives), verbs, adjectives, adverbs, auxiliaries, postpositions, interrogative
words, words of quantification (numerals and quantifiers), pluralizers (dual and plural),
particles (such as negation, causation, imperative particles, etc.), subordinators andinterjections. Nouns and verbs are the two main open classes and the distinction between
them is clear. The case of adjectives is a little more complicated, because they share some
of the characteristics of both nouns and verbs, but at the same time they present
characteristics that are unique to them; section 2.2.4. of this chapter will explore the
characteristics of adjectives. As we will see later, pronouns and demonstratives can be
analyzed as a subclass of nouns, given the similarities in their behaviors.
This chapter is dedicated to the characteristics of the Noun Phrase in Trumai
(section 2.1) and its components (section 2.2. and subdivisions); that is, nouns,pronouns/demonstratives, adjectives, words of quantification, and pluralizers. It also
presents the Trumai postpositions (section 2.3) , which can follow the NP; and a
discussion of the differences/similarities between the postpositions and the case-marking
enclitics is provided. Section 2.4. describes in more detail the NPs involving possession.
The remaining word classes will be described in chapter 3 (verbs, adverbs, particles),
chapter 4 (auxiliaries), 5 (interjections) and chapter 10 (subordinators).","[41, 42]"

allomorphs: one for NPs in the Absolutive case (ha), another one for NPs in the Ergative
and Dative cases (hai). The third person pronouns present an interesting allomorphy when
combined with the pluralizers: instead of ine + pluralizer or inatl + pluralizer, as we
would expect (since that is what happens for the Ist. and 2nd. persons), we have the use
of the allomorph inak , which is never attested in other environments (that is, without the
presence of the pluralizers). The use of inak in some sense neutralizes the gender
distinction made for the 3rd person singular. Finally, the dual presents an interesting
allomorph when combined with case markers (ana).
Like the personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns in Trumai can be considered
a subclass of nouns, since they also can receive case markers, and they can be the head of
the NP. Besides gender and number, the Trumai demonstrative pronouns distinguish the
distance of the referred entity: proximal or distal.

"289align, how can we still group them together as the Subject of the language? Again, which
coding property is relevant for characterizing the Subject of a language?
According to Givén (1997:29), behavior-and-control properties would reflect
grammatical relations more faithfully than morphology, because they are more directly
motivated by pragmatic factors, while morphology is not: “Being the most
grammaticalized, ritualized or automated feature in grammar, morphology has a higher
potential for dissociation from semantic or pragmatic function, in this case the topicality
function of subjects and objects”.
Givén also points out that the Subjects of the languages of the world can present
different degrees of grammaticalization: “...languages with fewer subject properties have
a less prototypical - less grammaticalized - subject.” (Givon, 1997:29). In other words, a
Subject that is very grammaticalized exhibits properties in all levels: case marking, word
order, syntactic behavior, etc.. When the Subject of a language is little grammaticalized, it
exhibits few properties, most likely in the syntactic behavior-and-control (which is more
directly influenced by pragmatic factors) and less likely in the morphology.
Thus, for an Ergative language, the coding device that “least safely” leads us to
identify the category of Subject is the morphology, and that behavior-and-control
properties can be more helpful. However, even in this case we need to be careful, because
the Subject of the language under study may be little grammaticalized and may therefore
not show many properties even at the syntactic level.","[316, 317]"
"73In the case of the Dative markers, besides -as /-es /-s, which are often attested inthe Trumai data, it is possible to find three others, attested so far with a limited number of
words:e-is, attested with the interrogatives han ‘what’ and tsifan ‘which thing’, the pronoun
in ‘it?, and with the noun kuyan ‘grass’ (example 184). Except for kuyan, the others
are all pronominal forms.","[98, 99]"
"Some kinds of NPs have only one option for the Dative marker, while some have
two; none allow the choice of all three markers. We first will present the possiblemarker(s) for each kind of head, with examples. After that we will discuss the cases

previous work (Guirardello 1992), postpositions in Trumai have independent stress.
lots’
letsi
tam‘Ablative’
‘Instrumental’
‘Comitative’nik‘Without’(h)ita‘Allative’”®What are the differences and similarities between the case markers and the
postpositions? The difference is that the case markers are phonologically bound forms,
while postpositions are free. The similarity is that both occur at the end of the NP, not on
its head, as we would expect for the case markers if they were suffixes instead of
enclitics. This fact could lead us then to the question: are the Trumai case markers merely
cliticized postpositions? We could say yes, because of the similarity in the site of location*8 The Allative postposition is represented with the initial sound h in parentheses because we are not sure
about its occurrence (some few consultants claim that there is an initial h , but not the other consultants).
The Allative seems to have another allomorph, ata, attested in only 2 cases:
(i)
ham ata
‘to where’
(ham ‘where, which place’)
(ii)
in ata
‘to it (it=meeting) °
(in ‘it’)
Since ham and in seem to be pronominal forms, we could say that ata is the Allative allomorph used with
pronouns. However, it is not so clear that this is the best analysis, because: (a) (h)ita is also attested with
pronouns (example (iii) below); (b) the other postpositions do not have special allomorphs for pronominalforms (example (iv) below). It might be that the allomorph ara is simply morphologically conditioned,
occurring only with ham and in.

A final remark with regard to the postposition (h)ita: sometimes it can alternate with the Dative
marker -ki, which can also mark ‘location’ if motion is involved. The difference between (h)ita and -ki is
that with -ki, the entity performing the motion reaches its target (cf. chapter 7)76(following the NP) and because the case markers probably were originally postpositions
that now are on their way to becoming affixes. However, this does not mean that NPs
modified by postpositions and case markers all have the same status. As we will see in
chapter 7, there are motivations for treating the NPs marked as ‘Ergative and ‘Dative’ as
distinct from the NPs modified by the other case markers and from the NPs modified by
postpositions.","[100, 101, 102]"
"One could then raise a question: why are nouns referring to inanimate entities not
modified by pluralizers? In the case of nouns in Dative NPs, the use of the pluralizer
would not be necessary since the case maker selected for the NP can give information
about whether the DAT argument is individual or not (cf. chapter 7 for the differences
among the Dative markers): t’ak-ki‘manioc bread’ (one round)’; t’ak-es ‘manioc bread62(several rounds)’. However, the other roles do not have several options for marker - there
being only one marker for each kind: -ek/-k ‘Ergative’; -¢ ‘Absolutive. Probably the nonuse of pluralizers with nouns referring to inanimate entities has to do with the fact that
inanimates do not have the same saliency and topicality as human animate nouns; since
they are not so salient, there is less motivation for expressing refined information (such as
number) about them. Besides that, the presence of numbers and quantifiers can already do
the job of indicating difference in number. Actually, these facts are also true for animate
noun-human nouns that are DAT (examples (150-151) above). Event participantscodified as DAT in general have low topicality, especially the animate non-human or the
inanimate ones. Thus, they are less likely to take pluralizer information.
However, we have also to consider that the use of pluralizers in Trumai cannot be
accounted only in terms of semantic and topicality factors, after all, some languages of
the world do mark plural on NPs with inanimate nouns. Therefore, we must also
recognize the conventionalized modes of expression found in each language; that is,
while some languages “choose” to present refined information even with inanimate NPs,
other languages, like Trumai, do not.","[87, 88]"

"As we can see, in Trumai we do not have reasons to group {S,A} together as the
category of Subject, and to say that the Subject of this language is actually the grouping
{S,O} is not a good solution either. The same can be said with regard to the category of
Object: there are no reasons to group O and the DAT argument of Extended Intransitive
verbs together, given their differences in case-marking (O is marked by -9, DAT by -#l, ki, -s), word order (O is preverbal, DAT follows the VP), and syntactic behavior (O aligns
with S rather than with DAT).",[323]
"We cannot say that tsi- in all these cases is the same morpheme, since in nouns
tsi- is clearly a possessor, while in the other cases fsi- is not. However, there is a point in
common in all these cases: tsi-, despite its classification, seems to be indicating that the
word that bears it (noun, adjective, particle) is not adjacent to the element that this word
has its relationship to (i.e. the possessed noun is not adjacent to a possessor noun; the
adjective in not adjacent to a modified noun; the hearsay particle is not adjacent to the
verb). Perhaps the original function of the prefix rsi- was that (i.e., to indicate nonadjacency of two words that would usually be adjacent) and over time it assumed more
specific functions, becoming a possessive morpheme in the case of nouns, and having
other functions in the case of adjectives and particles.
The morpheme tsi- in ‘Consequential’ clauses can also be analyzed as indicating
non-adjacency: the ‘Consequential’ clause describes event X; the reason Z that makes
event X happen is not described in the same sentence (i.e. is not adjacent to it); rather, the
reason Z is described in the preceding sentence. In other words, the morpheme tsi- here
seems to have an anaphoric nature (it does not seem to be a possessive morpheme, but it
is anaphoric):376[ Z][ienuk tsi-iets’ X]_‘Z occurs; because of it X occurs’——_____”Thus, structurally speaking, the ‘Consequential’ clause cannot be considered a
subordinate clause, because the antecedent and the consequence come in separate
sentences. The presence of an intonational break between the two reinforces this analysis.
The ‘Consequential’ clause is thus similar to the examples described in section 10.1.2 in
the sense that this kind of clause is connected to the preceding clause by a connector that
has an anaphoric element, and by the fact that this clause is not grammatically dependent
on the previous clause (i.e. it can stand by itself).
However, in terms of semantic dependency, the ‘Consequential’ clause is a little
different from the examples of the previous section, because the ‘Consequential’ shows a
stronger semantic dependency on the preceding clause. The clauses presented in section
10.1.2. are linked to the previous discourse, but they still can be interpreted by
themselves. The ‘Consequential’, in contrast, needs the previous clause/sentence to have
its sense complete. The ‘Consequential’ clause is not subordinate, but is not like the
clauses in section 10.1.2 (at least, not semantically speaking). It has a unique nature.
A final remark on the ‘Consequential’ clause is with regard to the morpheme
ienuk. The morpheme ienuk is similar in form to the adverb nuk ‘then’, but it is not clear
if ienuk is an allomorph of this adverb. The use of nuk is not possible, and the omission of
ienuk is not allowed:

Indian individual beautiful
-Dat
‘I saw the beautiful Indian.’It is difficult to determine the semantic contribution of this morpheme to the NP
where it occurs. The morpheme (i)yi is reminiscent of many things, but is not consistently
any of them:
(1) not a pronoun: the allomorph iyi occurs by itself in the NP; therefore, it might be
considered pronominal. The allomorph yi can occur in an NP that has a 3rd person
pronoun, that is, [Pro yi]. If we say that yi is also pronominal, then we would have two
pronouns in the same NP, a fact not otherwise attested in Trumai. Therefore, we have to
conclude that yi is not pronominal. But then, can a morpheme have an allomorph that is
pronominal (iyi) and another one (yi) that is not? And if the allomorph iyi is really
pronominal, why can it not receive case marking by itself? We cannot have [iyi]-ki
(Dative) nor {iyi]-k (Ergative), only [noun yi]-ki or [nouniyi]-k, as in the example (166)above. As we can see, there are problems in considering the morpheme (i)yi a pronoun.(2) not an indicator of definiteness: at first sight, we could imagine that (i)yi is a definite
article, given its frequency of use, its occurrence in 3rd person noun phrases, and its
position in the NP (i.e., the rightmost element). The problem is that this morpheme also
occurs with indefinite NPs, as we can see in the example (168a) above, and it co-occurs
with pronouns (examples 160-161). Therefore, we cannot call it a definite article. On the
other hand, it is noticeable that the use of (i)yi is more frequent among the young
speakers, who are all bilingual in Portuguese (our unquantified impression is that older66people use (i)yi much less frequently than younger speakers). It might be that the high use
of definite articles in Portuguese - which are employed even with proper names - is
influencing the younger speakers of Trumai, and perhaps because of such influence, these
speakers are attributing new functions to (i)yi. However, this is just a hypothesis that
needs to be explored.(3) not an indicator of referentiality: we could say that the morpheme (i)yi is linked to the
expression of referentiality, because many of the NPs where (i)yi occurs have a referent
(if it is identifiable or not to the listener is another question). The problem is to deal with
examples such as (170):
(170)[yaw-t’ayi]ka_in[pitikyi].human.being-NzrEx
Foc/Tens monkey
‘The monkey was a human being.’ (lit: the monkey is an ex-human being)In (170), the NP /yaw-t’a yi] is the predicate of the clause; so, what is being made hereis a predication, rather than a simple reference. It is true that the predicate in (170) is
nominal, and nominal predicates can be referential. The question is to explain the
occurrence of yi both in the subject and the predicate. If the function of the morpheme
(i)yi is merely to indicate referentiality, why do we have the “overuse” observed in the
example above? What is the motivation for that?
There are cases in which the occurrence of the morpheme (i)yi is even harder to
understand: sometimes (i)yi can alternate with the Copula chi, such as in the example
below:67(171)t-eche

"37110.1.2. Clauses linked by discursive connectorsAs mentioned above, some clauses (actually, sentences) can be combined through
the use of the discursive connectors inis , in t’atske, or in lots’. The discursive connectorsoccur in first position and very often are followed by the adverb hen ‘then’. Their
function is specifically to link the clause where they occur to the preceding discourse.
The connectors can actually be analyzed as being composed by the pronoun in ‘it’
plus a Dative marker or a postposition. The pronoun in is anaphoric, referring to the event
described in the preceding clause (or, in some cases, to a larger stretch of the preceding
discourse); the Dative marker or postposition provides information about how the second
event is “located” in relation to the first event:{a]Clause I[ in + Dative/Postp
Clause 2JTable 10.1 below presents the discursive connectors with their respective
meanings. Following, there are examples of the use of each connector:
Table 10.1. Trumai Discursive Connectorsconnectorglossin-is
in lots’
in-t’a lots’?
in t'atske *‘in it’
‘from it’
‘from it-past’
‘after it’2 In other words, the first clause is independent from the second one. It is not embedded in the second
clause, it is just “represented” there by the pronoun in.
3 tis not clear what the difference between [in lots’] and [in-t’a lots’] is. Both connectors can be translated
as ‘next’, because in both cases, the event described in the preceding clause is finished.
‘In our corpus, there are no examples of NP + t’astke, but on the basis of its occurrence with in, t’astke
seems to be a postposition.","[398, 399]"
"Given that S and O align in many ways, what should we conclude? Should we say
that the Subject in Trumai is the grouping {S,O}? There are problems with this position
as well:
(i) as already mentioned, the O argument is prototypically a patient, while S is an agent. If
we group S and O together, what is the category Subject in Trumai after all?
Semantically, S and O are different; they do not share a common role.
And if we say that O is the Subject (i.e. the primary topic) of a clause, what is then
the A argument? The Object (i.e. the secondary topic)? In this case, we would have a
language in which O is always codified as being more topical than A, even though Aisagent, a very salient participant of the event, and a strong candidate to be the primary
topic of any Transitive clause. As we see, it is problematic to say that O is the Subject of
a clause. Even if we say that A is not the Object, but rather an ‘Oblique’, there will becomplications (cf. item (iii)). Another problem is that the suppression of the S argument
in a clause produces semantic effects that are different from the suppression of the O
argument (cf. chapter 9, section 9.1.1). This being so, how much sense does it make to294group S and O together as the ‘Subject’ of this language? To us, it seems that to group S
and O as the Subject category of Trumai is to let the formal criteria override semantic and
pragmatic factors that are also important.(ii) to say that the grouping {S,O} is the Subject in Trumai forces the language to satisfy
the necessity of having grammatical relations. Is really necessary to talk about Subject or
Object in order to describe the Trumai grammar? No. We can describe the system and the
syntax of the language only on the basis of the argument types (Absolutive, Ergative,
Dative) that are found in a clause. The use of the labels introduced in section 7.1.1. is alsoenough to describe the Trumai grammar;(iii) one could suggest that in a clause with A and O arguments, the O argument (the NPpatient, marked by -¢) is the Subject, and the A argument (the NP-agent, marked by -k) is
actually an ‘Oblique’. Thus, a clause with a verb such as mapa ‘break’ would have the
following configuration:
AgentPatientNP-kNP-¢Vv>AgentPatient‘Oblique’SubjectVin other words, the clause would have a passive voice configuration, with the patient
marked as Subject (the primary clausal topic) and the agent marked as ‘Oblique’ (a
peripheral function). An important detail here is that this “passive” clause has no active
counterpart, in which the NP-agent would be codified as Subject (primary topic) and the
NP-patient would be codified as Object (secondary topic). There is obviously a problem295with this analysis. It is strange that a language would have “passive” clauses without
having active ones, considering that the passive voice is cross-linguistically more
restricted in discourse (this kind of voice is generally used for special purposes, such as
demoting the agent and promoting the patient to primary topic). Therefore, to say that {O,
S} (the Absolutive) is the Subject category of Trumai does not help us to understand the
system of the language; on the contrary, it leads us to characterize it in a strange way;(iv) one could say that the grouping {S,O} would be the Subject category in Trumai
because, according to the coding properties presented above, every sentence has a
Subject, and in Trumai the Absolutive is always present in a clause. However, this is not
exactly true. The Absolutive argument in Trumai occurs in all clause types, that is, the
canonical Intransitive and Transitive clauses. However, not every individual clause
necessarily has an Absolutive mark. Sometimes the Absolutive argument is suppressed
because of pragmatic reasons (cf. chapter 9 on voice).","[321, 322, 323]"

puma-t’
(49) _ pita-t’‘place of hiding’
‘place of exiting’As we can see, the use of -t’(a) with verbs is slightly different from its use with
nouns and adjectives. With the latter, -t’(a) seems to be associated with an idea of ‘past’,
in the sense of ‘“‘no longer X”. The combination of a noun or adjective + -t'(a) impliesthat in the past the entity was a member of the category defined by the noun or adjective,
but the entity no longer belongs to this category (e.g. the noun yaw ‘human being’ + -t’(a)
refers to an entity that was a member of the category “Human Being’ in the past, but now
the membership is over; the entity now is an ‘ex-human being’). In the case of verbs, the
scenario is a little different. However, the combination verb + -t’(a) can also evoke theidea of ‘past’, in a different way: since the NP-patient is in a state that is after the end of
the action (that is, the action is over, is already past), we could say that the sense of past is
also in it. Anyway, it seems that all the uses of -t’(a) modifying words - that is, -t’(a) plus
nouns, adjectives, or verbs - can be unified by the more generic semantics of ‘ex-entity’.
The kind of entity (ex-member of a category; ex-“participant” of an event) will vary
depending on the class of the word modified by -t’(a) and its internal semantic
characteristics.","[126, 127]"
"Trumai does not have a conjunction such as the English ‘and’ for the coordination
of NPs or clauses. That fact is not surprising; according to Mithun (1988: 332-336), many
languages do not have overt markers of coordination. Instead, they signal coordination
through intonation. The clauses are combined with no intonation break, or with what
Mithun calls a ‘coma intonation’, “...a pause and a special non-final pitch contour”
(Mithun: 332). Juxtaposition and intonation alone are enough to signal coordination of
noun phrases or clauses in these languages.
Juxtaposition and ‘coma intonation’ are used for the noun phrase coordination in
Trumai (cf. chapter 2, section 2.1). In the case of coordination of clauses, the matter is
more complex. There are three attested ways to combine clauses. The question is whether
we can call any of them real instances of ‘coordination’.(i) in one case, we have the strategy described by Mithun: two clauses are juxtaposed, and
they are under the same intonational contour (the short pause between them is non-final).
There is no explicit connector linking them, only the intonation. The relationship between
the clauses is equal; each one has its own autonomy and can be used independently.

"Foc/Tens1Cop2.2.2. Personal and demonstrative pronounsPersonal pronouns in Trumai can be considered a subclass of nouns, since they
receive nominal morphology - e.g. the genitive morpheme and other case markers - and
they have almost the same syntactic behavior (with the exception of the possibility of
being modified by adjectives and words of quantification); that is, they also can be the
head of the NP.
The pronominal set distinguishes person (Ist, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, dual,
plural), gender (masculine, feminine - only for 3rd person Sg.) and inclusion/exclusion of
listener in the plural forms of first person (1st Pl inclusive/ exclusive).

"310on the hierarchy. Therefore, the motivation for the marking of the causee would merely
formal: the causee would receive the marking on the hierarchy that is available to it.
Comrie observes that some languages allow doubling on one of the positions in
the hierarchy (i.e. in some languages, in the causative of a Transitive verb the causee can
be marked as Accusative, resulting in a construction with two Accusatives). However, the
doubling respects the patterns observed elsewhere in the language (that is, doubling on
object would be possible for a language that allows other clauses to have two Accusative
objects). According to Comrie, the possibilities for doubling of a specific grammatical
relation would depend on its position in the hierarchy: the lower the position, the higher
the possibilities of doubling. As he points out (Comrie 1989:178), “doubling on subjects
is unknown in causative constructions; doubling on direct objects is attested, but
restricted; doubling on indirect object is very widespread”.
Considering Comrie’s ideas, the causative construction in Trumai would represent
a complicated case. If we consider the characteristics of the morpheme ka, we cannot call
the Trumai causative construction analytical, since ka is not a verb (it does not present
verbal properties). Thus, we would have to say that the Trumai causative construction is
morphological rather than analytical. However, if we say this, there will be problems. As
shown above, in the causativization of Transitive verbs, the NP-causee is marked asErgative, as well as the NP-causer. If the causative construction in Trumai involves only
one verb, then we have doubling on “subjects” in the construction; > that is, we have two> We are using the term ‘subject’ here in order to relate our discussion to the observation made by Comrie,
who uses this term in his work. However, to be more precise, what we have in the Trumai causativeconstruction is doubling on the A argument.","[337, 338]"

central area of Brazil, in the Xingu Reserve (see map, appendix 2). The current work is
the first attempt at organizing a reference grammar of this language, providing a general
description of how the system of Trumai is organized .
As the reader will notice, this study is not complete. Several points are only
partially explored due to lack of sufficient data. I apologize for this fact, but unfortunately
the work of description and analysis of an unknown language is susceptible to this kind of
problem when the access to the consultants is not so easy. On the other hand, there are somany different aspects to be explored in a language that is almost impossible to study it in
a very comprehensive way in only a few years. Thus, the current study has the limitations
of being just a Ph.D. dissertation, and not the “most definitive” work on the Trumai
language. In the future, I intend to fill gaps found in this work and refine the points that
need more analysis. I also intend to analyze certain aspects of the language in separate
studies, investigating these specific aspects in a deeper way.
Next, we have information about the Trumai people, their language, and about my
research work with them.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"
"Cop‘I am not curved (I have never been curved).’6.3.5. Negation of single elements/specific pieces of informationSuppose that a person learns about a piece of information that s/he thinks is not
correct according to her/his knowledge. The person probably will try to negate this
specific piece of information, in order to present the correct one. For instance, somebody
is told: ‘I heard that your mother got seriously sick’, but the speaker is wrong about who
got sick.The interlocutor then may reply: ‘No, not my mother. It was my sister who got
sick.’ In the reply, a specific piece of information is being negated. How is this kind of
negation made in Trumai?
When the piece of information being negated involves a pronoun, numeral,
adjective, or quantifier, the negator used is anuk, which - as we have seen before - is the
Negation particle for nominal constituents. Looking at examples (66-70), we may think
that anuk is directly modifying the pronoun/numeral/adjective/quantifier. However, when
we look at example (65), we can see that what anuk is modifying is not really a noun, but
rather a NP, which is probably the non-verbal predicate of a subject that is assumed by
the context, but not formally present (i.e. (Who is coming) is not Kumaru ; cf. English
pleonastic ‘it’: It is not Kumaru). We believe that the same is happening in the other
examples, that is, what anuk is negating is the non-verbal predicates of the implicit245subject: (Who went to Pavuru) was not us; (The hammocks that I bought) were not two;
(The coffee that I made) is not much; (My sister) is not tall.e(65)Noun[Kumaru yi] anuk.

(70)Adjective
atuk anuk.tallNeg‘(She’s) not tall.’ (my sister has many attributes, but she is not tall)Examples (68-69) above seems a little strange at first sight, because we would
expect the occurrence of [a’di tak] ‘a few (lit: not many)’ or [pix tak] ‘a little (lit: not
much)’, instead of Quantifier + anuk. A possible account for these examples would be to
say that [pix tak] and [a’di tak] are lexicalized as ‘a few’ and ‘a little’, respectively (a246point already mentioned in chapter 3, section 3.3.2). In this case, a separate negation
construction would be necessary for contrastive negation. If this hypothesis is accurate,
we would expect the combinations [a’di tak] anuk ‘it is nota few’ and [pix tak] anuk ‘itis not a little’ to be possible. If they are, then we indeed have a case of lexicalization.
This is a point to be checked in future field work.
Back to the negation of pieces of information, what about when the piece being
negated involves an adverb or a verb? In the case of an adverb, the negative word used ishahak, which means ‘no’ and which can be the answer to a yes/no question (example 71).
Hahak does not modify the adverb directly; the adverb is presented, followed by a pause,
and then hahak comes, negating apparently a presupposed question that includes the
adverb: [ (Am I going to sleep) here? No.]. In the case of a verb, we have the Negationparticle tak, modifying the verb (example 72). It is also possible to have the whole clause
repeated, but now in the negative modality (73).

the speaker to convey new information about the verb or its arguments, but rather to deny
information that the speaker thinks the listener has in mind. Any negative act has a
presupposed (or backgrounded) portion and an asserted (or foregrounded) portion. The
background portion means that there is some shared knowledge between speaker and
listener, who have a kind of communication contract. The negation denies the asserted
portion of the corresponding affirmative sentence, but the presupposed portion is not
denied. So, when a speaker negates an event involving an entity, he may deny that the
event happened, or that the entity was involved in the event, but he does not deny the
existence of the entity, which is assumed by the speaker. As Givén says, the negation of
the referentiality of the entity is coded by other forms, such as the negative words nobody
and nothing.
In Trumai, there are no special words like English ‘nobody’ or ‘nothing’, but there
are ways of expressing the same idea. Let’s see how the negation of referentiality is
expressed in Trumai.enobody
The idea of ‘nobody’ is expressed through the negation of the verb plus the use ofthe noun yaw, which literally means ‘people’, but when in a negative clause, has the
opposite meaning: ‘no people’. For example:
(74)hu’tsa takchi_inhachisee
Neg Foc/Tens |
‘I did not see anybody.’yaw-as.","[272, 273, 274, 275]"
"1PL-DatHowever, this omission does not mean that the co-occurrence of two Ergative NPsin the causative construction is not possible, only that it is avoided if the information can
be obtained from context. When it cannot, the speakers use the causative construction
with two Ergative NPs.
What about if we try to change the case marking of the NP-causee to Dative or
Instrumental? In this case, the semantics of the clause is changed, too: (i) the causation is
less direct; (ii) it cannot be accidental. In the case of the Dative marking, the consultant3 We wonder if Trumai children have problems in identifying causer and causee in examples with
causativized Transitive verbs.",[332]
"2707.2.3.1. Choice of Dative markers with obligatory participantsThe case-marking of the arguments required by a Trumai verb is rigid and cannot
be changed. That is, if a verb requires its arguments to be marked as Ergative and
Absolutive (or as Absolutive and Dative), that will be the only way they will be marked;
consultants do not accept changes in the case-marking. Only two verbs in Trumai exhibit
flexibility in this regard: xoxan ‘wash’ and tiami ‘squeeze’. These verbs allow both
Transitive and Extended Intransitive marking. For instance:
(24)a.hait-s ha mutxoxan.","[297, 298]"
"172.1. The structure of a Noun PhraseThe general structure of a noun phrase is:(a)(b)[DeterminerPossessor(c)
Noun(d)
Adjective(e)(f)Pluralizeriyi](a) Determiners: in general, the modifiers that precede the head noun are the words of
quantification, that is, numerals (e.g. huch ‘two’) or quantifiers (e.g. a’di ‘many’).
According to some speakers, the demonstrative forms ni’de ‘this (masc)’, ni’dat! ‘this
(fem)’, ka’ne ‘that (masc)’, ka’natl ‘that (fem)’ can also be used as modifiers precedingthe head noun (cf. section 2.2.2 on demonstratives). Finally, another possible determiner
is the word amonke ‘another’ (perhaps a subtype of words of quantification);(b) Possessor:with alienable possession,the possessor bears the genitive marker -k(a)te(e.g. Wari-kte tahu ‘Wari’s knife’). In inalienable possession, the possessor presents no
special morphology (e.g. Yakairu adifle ‘Yakairu’s sister’; Yakairu kuch ‘Yakairu’s
hair’). There are also third person anaphoric inalienable possessors, which are of two
kinds: anaphoric possessors for kinship terms and anaphoric possessors for body part
terms.","[42, 43]"
"ProximalMedialDistalnina
ni'de?ina
wennkaina
ka'ne/kande|We could speculate that the “missing” form in the chart would be the personal
pronoun ine, which originally could have been a demonstrative pronoun rather than a
personal one. Interestingly, some consultants say that in general they do not use the
personal pronoun in conversation, but rather they use the 3rd Absolutive enclitic in the
verb (i.e. ma-n rather than ine ma for ‘He eats.’). The personal pronoun ine is used
when one wants to point to the referred entity, instead of merely mentioning it.
However, if ine was originally a demonstrative pronoun, now it seems to be only a
personal one, because its use as modifier of a head noun in an NP seems not to be
possible, or at least it is controversial. According to one consultant, this example would
be acceptable:
(51)[ine axos yiJ-ki
that child yI-Dat
‘I beat that child.’chi_in
ha fa.
Foc/Tens 1 _ beat° There is one example that suggests that the difference between nina and ina is not only one of distance,
but also proximity in relation to locutor or interlocutor: in a letter to a friend, a Trumai used nina (here)
when refering to her own village and ina (there) when referring to the friend’s village.
10 ni’de can also be used to contrast situations:
(i)famaxke-sdealoke haahat’ ke.kill/fit ?-S
already fast
1 Dual in-future
‘If we kill (fish) a lot, soon we will be back.
ni'de

hat’ke
this.one kill/nit Neg already 1 Dual in.future long
already 1 Dual in-future
‘In contrast (in this other situation), if we do not kill anything, we will take time.’34The example above was not spontaneously given by a speaker, but it was rather
constructed on the basis of patterns observed in the language and presented to the
consultant for an opinion. So, even though the consultant accepted the example, the
question remains whether she really says it. A similar example was presented to another
consultant, who refused the use of ine as modifier, saying that it did not make sense:
(52)a.ni’demisu‘this mirror’this(masc) water/mirror
b. ka’ne
misu
that(masc) water/mirror‘that mirror’c. *ine misu?*he mirror’ (strange, nonsense)Therefore, it seems that ine is a personal pronoun indeed. The question is to know
if it was originally the medial demonstrative pronoun (with the full demonstrative set
being: ni’de - ine - ka’ne‘this’ - ‘that’ -‘yon’) or if Trumai has another form for themedial demonstrative pronoun.","[59, 60]"
"364the event for more time, either because the event lasts longer or because the entity carries
out the event more effectively. Given that the entity/executor is more involved in the
event, it also undergoes some of its effects. In some cases, the effects seem to be more
psychological than physical; at least, that is what is suggested by the restriction observed
in the use of puchu ‘disappear’: this verb cannot receive the prefix wa- if the entity
involved in the event is inanimate (an inanimate entity cannot undergo any psychological
effect from the event of being lost for a long time):
(60)a.axospuchu.child disappear
‘The child disappeared.’
b. axos wa-puchu.
disappear
child
‘The child disappeared (for a long time).’
(61)a.sapaun puchu.
disappear
soap
‘The soap disappeared.’
b. *sapaun wa-puchu.
(The soap disappeared.)In sum, the role of the morpheme wa- is to indicate stronger involvement of the
executor in the event, and this involvement somehow affects the executor. As mentioned
before, in middle situation types the entity performing the event is also affected by it.
Therefore, the semantics evoked by the presence of wa- seem to be related to middle
voice.
There are other arguments to say that wa- seems to be linked to the expression of
middle voice:365estrong parallels with other languages in which similar kinds of verbs take middle
markers (notice that the semantics of “away-path” created by the of wa- is also
observed in the use of middle markers in romance languages);epresence of at least one deponent verb (pata ‘arrive’), which always requires the
marker wa-. All languages with middle voice markers seem to have deponent verbs;ethere is one case in which semantics overrides transitivity (padi ‘wait’). This is also
observed in other middle voice languages (e.g. Latin).","[391, 392, 393]"
"348(31)fapti fatla-n.
ear pierce-3Abs
‘He pierced his ear.’The 3Abs enclitic -n/-e occurs on the verb when the Absolutive is not lexically present. If
we say that fapfi ‘ear’ is part of the Absolutive NP, then in examples (30-31) there is a
lexical item in the Abs NP; in this case, how can we explain the presence of the enclitic
on the verb? One could say that example (30) is an instance of possessor raising and that
the enclitic is on the verb because the possessor is not lexically present; but if that is the
case, what is then the status of fapfi ‘ear’?
A better solution would be to say that in examples (30)-(31) we have nounincorporation, and that the verb is actually [fapfi fatla] ‘ear-pierce’; then, it makes sense
that the enclitic -n occurs on the verb, since the Absolutive is not lexically realized. So, a
more adequate translation for example (30) is ‘He is ear-piercing him’, while for example
(28b) a better translation is ‘I cloth-put’.
Another argument in favor of the first analysis is that in Imperative constructions
with Transitive verbs, the O argument almost never occurs when it is a noun that refers tomaterial objects; but when O is a body part or related term, it is always present in the
construction:
(32)a. wana kudteteImp up.hair make.beatiful
‘Comb yourself!’
b. wa kud

Imp up.hair make.beautiful
‘Comb her (a child)’349(33)a.wana mut

b.wa mut
Imp dresspupe
take.out‘Undress her (a child)!’(34)wana k’ad xoxan
Imp hand wash
“Wash your hands!’(35)wanahondimaImp eye close
‘Close your eyes!’Incorporation of body part terms is observed in many other languages of the world. (e.g.
Paraguayan Guarani; Oluta Popoluca). This is a pattern already attested in human
languages; therefore, it would reasonable to say that Trumai also has the same
phenomenon.
However, there is a still a problem to be solved: the pattern observed in examples
(30-31) also occurs with non-verbal predicates, like the ones below; in other words, thispattern is not exclusive to Transitive verbs in a middle/reflexive construction. Could we
say that the examples below are also cases of noun incorporation?

{incorporation: [big mouth], 7]Velazquez (1996) describes the same kind of pattern in Paraguayan Guarani. In
her analysis, the Paraguayan examples are indeed instances of noun incorporation. We
believe that the same can be said for Trumai; however, we still want to investigate morethe patterns observed above before having a definite analysis, because as we can see in
example (36b), the morpheme (i)yi can occur with the “incorporated” noun. It might be
that the presence of (i)yi can be considered a counter-argument for calling these examples
cases of noun incorporation, but we cannot be certain until we identify the function of the
morpheme (i)yi (as mentioned in chapter 2, section 2.2.7, the function of this morpheme
is still not clear to us).","[375, 376, 377, 378]"
"6These clauses are embedded in the main clause, occupying the typical position of
a Dative or Absolutive argument. The subordinate verb in Dative-Complement clauses
seems to be non-finite (it behaves as a possessed noun); the scenario is a little more5 In Trumai, it seems that we can have only one Focus/Tense particle per sentence. In this case, example
(20) confirms the fact that the ‘Consequential’ clause is not structurally subordinate to the preceding one,
forming with it a single sentence.
SBy Absolutive clause, we mean here a clause that is an O argument. Cross-linguistically, it is possible to
have not only a sentential O argument, but also S and A arguments. In future research, we will check to
determine whether Trumai has subordinate clauses that function as S or A arguments of the main verb.",[405]
"201If ke here is a Relativizer, then [disi ke] means ‘one who kills’ and it is a nominalpredicate (the Copula is not presented here, but as mentioned in chapter 3 (section 3.5)
the Copula does not always occur in a nominal predicate). In this case, shouldn’t the
“subject” [kiki wan] ‘men’ be in the Absolutive? Instead, it is [pelasawak] ‘tapir’ that is
in the Absolutive, but tapirs are not the killers here, they are rather the killed ones. The
nominalizer for ‘patient’ is -t’(a), not -k(e) (cf. chapter 3, section 3.2). Therefore, it doesnot seem adequate to say that ke in (76) is a Relativizer, and that this example is an
instance of a cleft construction.
An alternative analysis would explain the morphosyntax of a cleft as indicating
the historical source of the modern construction, but would argue that, as in the case ofthe clefts for old obliques/NP Possessors that became main clauses (as argued in section
5.1.3), the construction has been reanalyzed into a standard clause type. Thus, thepresence of the Copula, the morpheme ke relativizing the verb, and the Negation particle
anuk would be explained. However, both the construction and the morpheme ke would
have changed their status as the construction was used more and more. Finally, it would
have been reanalyzed as a regular clause, with the difference that the verb comes in first
position. The morpheme ke does not indicate relativization anymore; the fact that ke is
optional in the negative clauses would be evidence for reanalysis. The question is to
identify the function of ke in the examples (68-69b), (74), and (75) above.","[226, 227]"

NP is the causer, which one is the causee on the basis of the position that the NPs occupy
in the construction, but the ideal scenario would be that the marking of the causer and the
causee were completely different, in order to avoid the risk of ambiguity with regard to
the role of each NP. This is what is observed in many languages: in the typological
literature, there are many examples of languages where the causee is marked as Dative or
Instrumental, while the causer has a different marker. Thus, the causative construction in304Trumai does not present the ideal situation, where all the relations are clearly stated;° that
is, although Trumai is a case-marking language, it uses word order (rather than casemarking) to disambiguate causer and causee. That makes the construction unusual
typologically.
We observe that speakers try to avoid the presence of two Ergative NPs in the
construction if the information can be inferred from the context, or it does not matter who
the causee is:

the use of tao represents an alternative way of expressing causative events, making
explicit how the causing event is brought about (i.e. through an order).
Now, bringing theoretical considerations to our study, how can we analyze the
causative construction in Trumai? First, let us see the approach proposed by Comrie. As
Comrie (1989:166-167) points out, languages can exhibit analytical or morphological/
synthetic causative constructions. The analytic causative has two verbs, one expressing
the predicate of causation, the other expressing the effect; causative constructions of this
type involve the use of verbs such as cause, make, etc. The morphological/synthetic309causative has one verb, and special morphology relates the causative predicate to the noncausative one.
The marking of the causee in morphological causatives is an important issue
for Comrie, especially when a Transitive verb is causativized. Given that inmorphological causatives there is only one verb, and that the introduction of the causer
brings one more participant to the event, the valency of the verb has to rearranged
(theoretically, analytical causatives would not have this problem, because there are two
verbs in the construction, and each verb would have its own set of arguments).*
According to Comrie (1989:175), “cross-linguistically, this problem of valency
increase is almost invariably solved by altering the expression of the causee”. In many
languages, when a Transitive verb is causativized, the causer is marked as subject and the
causee (the original subject) is marked indirect object (Dative) or Instrumental; in some
languages, the causee can be marked as object (Accusative). What would not be
observable in languages of the world is the marking of the causee as subject, because then
the causativized verb would have two subjects.
To account for the marking of the causee observed in the languages of the world,
Comrie proposes a hierarchy of grammatical relations: Subject > Direct Object > Indirect
Object > Other Oblique. His idea is that after all the other participants have been assigned
cases from the beginning of the hierarchy, the causee would receive the next case down4 “The morphological causative normally has a valency one higher than that of the corresponding noncausative, since in addition to the arguments of that non-causative predicate there is also the causer. With
analytic causatives this introduces no problems, since each of the two predicates, expressing cause and
effect, retains it own set of arguments” (Comrie, 1989:175).","[335, 336, 337]"

postposition nik ‘without’, which modifies the noun yaw:
(77)yawnikka_in.people without Foc/Tens

The idea of ‘nothing’ is implied by the negative modality of the clause, plus thefact that there is no “patient” mark in the clause: in the case of an Extended Intransitive
verb, the complement is completely omitted (example (78)); in the case of a Transitive orExtended Transitive verb, there is no 3Abs enclitic in the clause (example (79)).","[275, 276]"
"Case-marking patterns divide Trumai verbs into four categories: Intransitive,
Transitive, Extended Intransitive and Extended Transitive. Intransitives require a single
Absolutive argument; Transitives an Ergative and an Absolutive argument. Extended
Intransitives and Extended Transitives additionally require a Dative argument, usually
patient-like in Extended Intransitives and a recipient in Extended Transitives (cf. chapter
7 for a more precise characterization). The characteristics of a Trumai verb are:
eitis the head of a VP:(38)hai-ts [ha atlepit’a].",[125]
"311A arguments for the same verb. In no other construction in Trumai a single verb can have
two A arguments.
One could suggest that ka can still be considered a verb, just like tao ‘order/give
order’ is; in this case, one Ergative NP (the causer) would be an argument of ka, while the
other Ergative NP (the causee) would be an argument of the causativized verb. However,if ka does not present verbal properties, how can we can call it a verb? If we say that ka is
a main Transitive verb (like rao), it would be a very strange kind of verb. Therefore, the
“solution” of classifying the Trumai causative construction as analytical does not present
any advantage; it only forces an inappropriate analysis onto the Trumai data in order to
preserve a typological claim.
In any case, the Trumai causative construction with Transitive verbs is
problematic for Comrie’s approach:
1.if we say that the Ergative marking marks Transitive subjects in Trumai, then the
causative construction of this language clearly violates his hierarchy;2.if we say that the Ergative marking does not mark Transitive subjects, we still cannot
explain the doubling on A: if the marking of the causee is formally motivated, why is
the causee in the causative of Transitive verbs marked as Ergative? Why not as
Dative, since doubling on Dative is observed in other parts of the language (cf.
example (78) in chapter 7), while doubling on Ergative with the same verb is not?","[338, 339]"
"A problem regarding the pronominal set in Trumai involves two forms observed
in the corpus that seem to be also pronominal: in and ni. These two forms can be found
behaving as pronouns, that is, acting as the head of an NP and receiving nominal
morphology:
(44)in yi-ki
it(45)‘at it (it = the event of a woman going to work)’yYI-Datin-is‘at it (it = the event of a friend making a question)’it-Dat
(46)(47)in lots’

lots’
this Allat‘from this.one (one=place, the village), from here’However, there are no examples of in referring to a physical object rather than to
an event. Perhaps this is just a matter of a gap in the corpus. More complicated is the case
of ni, which sometimes behaves as an adverb:
(49)ni-ahi chi?here-Quest 2 Cop
“Are you here?”®
8 Observe that the adverbs nina ‘here’ and ina ‘there’ do not receive case marking:32(50)ni!
here
‘Here!’ (answer to the question: Where is the coffee?)Could we say that ni is a pronoun that sometimes can behave as an adverb? Or is
the adverbial occurrence of ni actually a reduction of the adverb nina ‘here’? At the
moment, there are no definitive answers for these questions. The only thing we could say
is that it would be possible to align in and ni with the attested Trumai pronouns:
Masc_
ineFem
inatlNeuter
in‘he - she -it’ni'de_ni’datlni‘this.one (M) - this.one (F) - this.one (N)’However, there are further questions: (1) it is necessary to check if both in and nican be pluralized. This capacity would make more clear their pronominal status; (2) there
is no neutral form for ‘that one’. In one text, the form inde was found, but it seems to be
an adverb rather than a demonstrative pronoun (i.e. ‘there (not so far from speaker or
listener)’ rather than ‘that one’). This third form needs to be investigated further, and theother ones - in and ni - need extra checking, with special attention to the interplay
between ni and nina.
As a final remark, we observe that the set of adverbs for place have anintermediate stage between proximal and distal: ina ‘more or less close’. The whole set is(i)wana aha’tsi ninaImp
sit
‘Sit here!’here33nina - ina - kaina ‘here’ - ‘there’ - ‘yonder’.? We do not have a parallel for the
demonstratives, that is, there is a gap in set:

‘I “have” the shaman (I kidnapped him).’In relation to the expression of negation in predicative possessive constructions,
we observe that the negation particle tak is required in all cases: in the case of alienable
possession, it modifies the word k’ad, which is the verb of the clause; in the case of
inalienable possession, it negates the nominal root that behaves as the verb:”8?8 Notice that the construction in these examples is of the same kind as the ones discussed in section 5.2.3
Consultants consistently offer this word order (i.e. V Neg ka_in Subj Cop) when the possessive predicate is
in the negative modality.",[244]
"357This selection resembles the use of antipassive constructions. As we have already
seen, Extended Intransitive verbs encode the agent as S and the “patient”/second
participant as DAT, while Transitive verbs encode the agent as A and the patient/second
participant as O. In some languages of the world, when the patient/second participant is
high in importance, it is marked as O, and when it is not important, an antipassive
construction is used, demoting the second participant to a peripheral position, such as
Instrumental or Dative (cf. Givén 1994).
We have something similar occurring in Trumai: Ist person pronouns are higher
in importance than 3rd person pronouns, since the first person pronoun refers to the
speaker, while the third person pronoun refers to another entity, a non speech-act
participant. Looking at the data above, we can see that when we have an patient high in
importance (1st person pronoun), the Transitive verb is selected, marking the patient as
O. However, when we have a patient low in importance (3rd person pronoun), then the
Extended Intransitive verb is used, marking the Patient as DAT:
If Pat important:
If Pat less important:Transitive verb is selected
Extended Intransitive verb is selected(Pat = O)
(Pat = DAT)Therefore, the choice between the pairs of verbs presented above produces an
effect that is similar to that produced by Antipassive constructions, with the difference
that the process here is not morphosyntactic; it is rather a matter of lexical choice, and it
is limited by the number of alternating verb pairs available in the language.
However, it is important to say that the tendency described above is not observed
when both agent and patient are 3rd person. Let us recall example (12) presented before:358(50)wan sa-tke-n-es,

let’s.goso then
~-there then call
call
then
“Let’s go!” - then, in this occasion, they call (other people, not defined here).’In this example, the second participant in the event of ‘calling’ is not defined and seems
to be not relevant for the event ; the important thing is the act of calling itself. Note that
the verb (a)midoxos ‘call’ is a Transitive verb that has an Extended Intransitivecounterpart, chafa ‘call’. The speaker could have selected chafa, following the tendency
described before (i.e. when the patient is low in importance, the Extended Intransitive
verb is used), but instead she chose (a)midoxos and omitted the 3rd person Absolutiveenclitic, producing an antipassive effect.
Why did the speaker not select the Extended Iniransitive verb? Perhaps she
preferred the Transitive verb without the 3Abs enclitic because this strategy would
produce a better coding of the importance of the second participant. That is, it might be
that there is a gradation of importance of the patient/second participant depending on
its case-marking, something like:
* Second participant Important:Transitive root with 3 Abs enclitc* Second participant not so important:Extended Intransitive root with DAT present (that is,
second participant is still expressed in the clause, but
in a peripheral position. The selection of the markers
-(V)tl, -ki, -(V)s gives further specification on howperipheral the participant is (cf. chapter 7)359* Second participant even less important:Transitive root without 3 Abs enclitic (second
participant is not marked/formally expressed in the
clause)* Second participant completely unimportant:Extended Intransitive root without DAT at all (since
the event is codified as basically Intransitive, the
idea/presence of a second participant is even more
vague here)This scale is just a speculation, formulated on the basis of what is known so far
about the system of the language. More studies on texts will be necessary to confirm if
this hypothesis is right. We also will need to check if there are other pairs of verbs like
the ones described above, and to what extent their meanings overlap.","[384, 385, 386, 387]"
"4.2.2.3. Auxiliaries that are homophonous with main verbs
As Heine (1993:49) points out, verbs can be the origin of auxiliaries, butauxiliaries are no longer full verbs (Heine:86), given that they exhibit differences in
behavior, in semantic content, and sometimes even in the phonological form (some
auxiliaries undergo cliticization).
We do not know whether all auxiliaries in Trumai evolved from verbs, but in
some cases it is possible to say so, since the verb that was the origin of the auxiliary still
exists in the language. However, the auxiliary cannot be equated with the source-verb145anymore, because of the differences in meaning and syntactic behavior. The meaning of
the auxiliary is not identical to the meaning of the verb; often, the auxiliary is more
abstract (e.g. Aspect/Mood auxiliaries) or it misses some components that are part of the
meaning of the verb (e.g. Posture auxiliaries). With regard to syntactic behavior, the
auxiliary functions as a verb modifier and has no independent argument structure.
In order to point out that the auxiliaries are distinct from the verbs that gave rise to
them, we are treating these auxiliaries as being homophonous with main verbs. That is,
verb and auxiliary have the same phonological form, due to the origins of the auxiliary,
but they are already distinct forms which present different characteristics.
First, we have the Aspect/Mood auxiliaries whose source-verbs are still alive in
the language. The source-verbs are all Intransitive:Table 4.1. AM auxiliaries that are homophonous with verbs

"In the last case, the presence of -ke is always attested after -t’(a), which makes us think

renewed. In modern data, in can be found in questions following NPs with WH-words (cf.
section 2.2.3). So, the configuration of clefts changed to:
obliqueka in[NPVerb in nominalized form]obliquechiin[NPVerb in nominalized form]As said before, over time the nominalizations of verbs were reanalyzed as verbs in

Verb]At some moment in the history of the language (stage 3), the cleft construction
replaced the main clause, that is, it became the norm instead of a special kind of clause
(Heine & Reh 1984 attest a similar development in African languages). This was
especially true for clauses that were an answer to a question (in the modern language, we
can see that answers tend to have the presence of ka_in or chi_in). The sequences ofmorphemes ka + in and chi + in started being seen not as mere linear sequences of
morphemes, but as morphemes in association. They were reanalyzed as units, becoming
now markers of focus which, at the same time, would carry tense information too. Later,in some cases, their use became optional. We know this because not all modern clauses
have the presence of ka_in or chi_in; however, the morphosyntax of the modern clauseswith ka_in/chi_in and the ones without them is basically the same: the original NP
possessor became Absolutive NP; the verb is “naked”, without inflectional marks. If the187Absolutive NP is not right before the verb because it is in focus or it is separated from the
verb by an adverb, there is a morpheme Xe after the verb. These morphosyntactic facts are
true for all main clauses, with or without ka_in/chi_in. Therefore, they came from the
same source (clefts),!° and if some of the modern clauses do not present the Focus/Tenseparticles, it is because these particles became non-obligatory (the clauses without them
would have not completive focus, but neutral focus, that is, no element under focus). In

Besides the African languages cited in Heine and Reh (1984), such complete replacement of old main
clause verbal systems is attested in the Cariban family (cf. Gildea 1998).

results:
(i) the “creation” of the Focus/Tense particles chi_in and ka_in. The parts of the units
(ka/chi and in) are still not completely fused into a single form, since the sequence can
stillbe broken by adverbs, but they do form a semantic unit, being intimatelyassociated, despite the presence of possible adverbs between them. This also explains the
presence of a reflex of the modern Copula chi in chi_in.(ii) SV and OV are VPs, “preserving” the fact that S and O used to form a constituent
with the element that was originally their possessed noun and that is now the verb. Given
that, S and O have fixed position - right before the verb.","[211, 212, 213, 214]"
"In the case of inanimate nouns, the use of the pluralizer is not possible. It seems
that the kind of NP where the noun occurs does not matter for licensing the use of the

of pluralizers with inanimate beings, like in example (154b);”' but even in this case the

an NP, a PP, a VP, an AdvP, or an S.° The case of adjectives, demonstratives, numerals,and quantifiers in first position is a little more complicated, since in general they are
found inside NPs, but when they occur in first position, they seem to form a constituent
by themselves, in the same way adverbs can. Perhaps in this case they could be grouped
together with Adverbial Phrases, since they do not fit the other kinds of constituents.
As already argued in chapter 3, the sequence S Vins forms a constituent in Trumai,
since the Focus/Tense particles are often found following a S V combination. On the
other hand, the DAT argument seems to be a constituent by itself, not being part of the
VP. Even though these facts seem to be a little strange - after all, we would expect that S
would be a constituent and O V (DAT) another one - they can be understood if weanalyze them from a historical perspective. In section 5.1.3 these issues will be addressed
