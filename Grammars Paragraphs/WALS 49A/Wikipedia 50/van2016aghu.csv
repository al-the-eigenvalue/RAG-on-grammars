"When used as arguments in verbal clauses, the interrogative pronouns
behave the same as nouns. They optionally combine with the nominative or
accusative cases markers te NOM or ke ACC, as can be seen in (264) and
(265)a-c below. Note that, parallel to what we saw for full NP’s in 3.1.7, te
is used to mark either an intransitive subject (as in (264)) or a transitive
subject (as in (265)a and b), while ke is used to mark an object. As is clear
from (265)a-c, the function of the case marker is to disambiguate between
different syntactic roles. The fact, however, that it is also possible to use a
case marker in (264) — where the syntactic role of meoxo is not ambiguous
— shows that it must also have a pragmatic function.154(264)meoxo(te)da-xewho(NOM)come-N1.RLS[SG]‘Who has come?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)

"3.1.7 Optional non-inflectional case markers te and ke
Drabbe 1957: section 103c, p. 42a; section 103p, p. 43bThis section discusses the case markers te and ke as attested in verbal
clauses. For a discussion that includes the marking of pronouns and NP’s,
in non-verbal clauses the reader is referred to section 4.4.
In verbal clauses, pronouns and noun phrases can be followed by one of the
case markers te or ke (or kèmu / kumu, see 3.6.2 below). Te ‘NOM’ is
optionally used to mark a subject, while ke ‘ACC’ may be used to mark the
object. In this book I will use the term object for those constituents that can
be marked with ke and which bear the semantic role of patient, beneficiary
or target. In addition, ke may be used to mark a location or a temporal
expression, although we hardly have any examples of the latter use. 135
Although te and ke belong to the class of postpositional case markers that
will be discussed in 3.6, the fact that they mark the central syntactic
functions of subject and object justifies an additional discussion here. Te
and ke may be seen as having a disambiguating function, as they can easily
be left out when the context makes clear what is intended. Compare the
following examples, where the interpretation of (221a) is dependent on the
context and allows for different readings out of context, but ( b) and ( c )135In fact, the only example is the expression womiŋ ge / gèmu ‘in the night’ provided byDrabbe in his discussion on kèmu, kumu and ke (Drabbe 1957:42a). Cf. 3.6.2 below.",[193]
"173It must be admitted that here the semantic argument that was used above as evidencethat gesi is not an adverb at first sight does not seem to hold. Here reference is made to a
lying close, which could possibly be taken as being a modification of the verb. I believe,
however, that an analysis of gesi as a noun is still to be preferred. First and most
importantly, gesi is used in a position in which one can also use nouns. If we consider gesiPART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes237Below we find another series of illustrations of the use of spatial nouns,
which have all been taken from the text corpus. Again, while some of these
seem to be developing into adverbs, or seem to be used adverbially, they
are generally used in positions where one also finds other nouns. In (365),
we find mo as indicating the location of the predicate baxe ‘he sits’:
(365)Efesẽmobaxe,efesẽmoba-xe3SGhusbandbacksidesit-N1.RLS[SG]efenagãmügünükbaxe.efen-agãmügü-nü=kba-xe3SGLNK-wifebe.in.front-SS=CONsit-N1.RLS[SG]‘The husband sits in the back, the wife sits in the front.’ (4.69)In the example below, womu ‘inside’ is used in a possessive construction
with axafĩ ‘women’s house’, referring to the house’s inside. Since thegrammatical role of object, in our definition, includes the semantic role ofas a noun also here, we have a more economic analysis than if we consider it an adverb, as
this would lead to an extra set of adverbs. Second, one could think of gesi etc. as
expressing a place close to another point in space, rather than as a modification of the
predicate. In cases like (362) and (363), the point in space is provided by the noun. In a
case like (364), it is provided by the deictic center, which defines as the perspective from
where the narrative is described, cf. 3.2.4.
174Even stronger evidence in favor of their analysis as nouns would be provided byexamples where the forms are used as subject (as in English ‘the inside was clean’), or in
other positions where they could not in any way be analyzed as adverbs, e.g. in a role of
patient or instrument, (e.g. ‘I saw the backside’). Unfortunately, no such examples are
provided by Drabbe. Also missing are examples where we find independent forms
followed by nominative te or accusative ke.","[254, 255]"
"3.7 Non-adjectival nominal markers
3.7.1 The marker ta
Drabbe 1957: section 103o, p. 43aDrabbe refers to ta as a postposition, which is the term that he also uses for
what this book describes as postpositional case markers (see 3.6 above).
Although it is true that the marker is always used postnominally, its
function is different from that of the postpositional case markers described
above. While case markers mark the semantic or syntactic role of an
argument or adjunct with regard to the predicate, the marker ta has a
pragmatic function. It seems to mark the shift to or reactivation of the other
topic out of two entities (where the entity can also be a group), and can best
be rendered in English by the expression ‘in turn’. In addition to a sentence
from the text corpus (see (401) below), Drabbe gives the following two
examples:
(399)numumukiomogowaki-kenan-axu1SGfirsteyebadbecome-N1.RLS[SG]1SGLNK-humanjoxoketakiomogowaki-ke-nã3PLFOCIN.TURNeyebadbecome-N1.RLS-N1PL‘I got an eye infection first, and then my relatives got it in turn’ (Drabbe
1957:43a)
(400)nuketasiüadi-je1SGFOCIN.TURNbananaeat_II[1SG]-FUT‘I will eat from the bananas in turn too’ (Drabbe 1957:43a)PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes253In the text corpus, the marker has a very limited distribution, and is attested
almost exclusively185 in the following context:
[Efe(n)3SGLNKpossessor[…]NP ]POSSESSIVE CONSTRUCTIONeketa3SG.FOCIN.TURNpossessedIn all cases the marker ta directly follows the emphatic 3SG pronoun eke
(once efe ke), and Drabbe writes explicitly that ta cannot follow the
possessive phrase directly.186 Note that also in (399) and (400) above we
find ta preceded by a pronoun plus ke. The sequence eke ta, in turn, follows
a possessive expression (again, this is also what we find in (399) and
(400)), in which the possessor corresponds to one out of two narrative
topics, and the possessor corresponds to the other one. In all contexts, the
two topics are relatives in a dyadic relation. The use of eke ta was
discussed extensively in 3.2.3.2, so that we can limit ourselves here to
giving some additional examples.
Consider (401) below. The sentence is part of a story about two sisters, a
younger and an older one. In 1.050 and 1.051 it is narrated how the older
sister goes out, while the younger stays at home. The elder goes out,
collects sago grubs, comes up, they roast the grubs and eat. Then follows
(401), in which it is told that it is now the oldest sister’s turn to stay at185In one case we have a 3PL pronoun joxo instead of a 3SG pronoun efe, and once we findefe ke ta instead of eke ta: see (402) below.
186To be more precise, he states that in (401) it is not possible to say efe neni ta (Drabbe1957:43a).","[270, 271]"
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes159Examples of this dyadic construction are given in (186) through (188)
below:
(186)efen-etoefen-amoko3SGLNK-father3SGLNK-son‘father and son’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)
(187)efen-amoefen-agã3SGLNK-husband3SGLNK-wife‘husband and wife’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 4.003)
(188)efeküdaefen-ēxo3SGyounger.sibling3SGLNK-elder.brother‘younger and elder brother’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 3.001)It is important to note that the dyadic construction can be used for dyadic
relations only, not for reference to pairs in a non-dyadic relation. In that
respect, it can be contrasted to the use of ko, as in (189) below, where the
phrase can refer either to a married couple (dyadic) or to a non-married
‘man and woman’:
(189)ãŋgokuwomanandman‘man and woman’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)3.1.5 Number
Drabbe 1957: section 9, p. 5a-b; section 14, p. 7b-8aThe famous linguistic scholar Roman Jakobson once stated that ‘languages
differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may
convey’ (Jakobson 1959). Every linguistic system, in other words, has
grammaticalized other aspects of reality, and every linguistic system should,
therefore, be described in its own terms. In this section, I would like to160PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesmake clear that Aghu differs with respect to a language like English in what
it must say about number. This is also true for definiteness, which will be
the topic of 3.1.6 below. speakers of English must specify each Noun
Phrase for number and definiteness: Noun Phrases are either singular or
plural, and either definite or indefinite. This is not true for speakers of
Aghu. Noun Phrases are generally not specified for number, and there is no
requirement in Aghu grammar to specify Noun Phrases for definiteness. In
the words of Drabbe:
“axu k’etede [human ACC see-1.RLS[SG] may mean: ‘I saw the man, a man, the men,men.””121Thus, while Aghu differs from English in what it must convey, speakers of
Aghu may choose to specify nouns for the categories expressed by number
and definiteness: they may choose to express whether a Noun Phrase refers
to single or multiple entities, and may choose to specify whether Noun
Phrases refer to entities known to the addressee or not. In the remainder of
this section we will consider number, while we will have a look at the
category of definiteness in section 3.1.6 below.
As stated above, nouns and noun phrases are generally not specified for
number. In line with Jakobson’s wording we may say that Aghu speakers
do not have to specify nouns and noun phrases for number. In these cases,
it is the linguistic or extralinguistic context which guides the interpretation.
Thus, in (190) and (191) it is knowledge of the world (that is: the
extralinguistic context) which makes that reference is made to a single
river, and to multiple fish traps.","[176, 177, 178]"
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure275The text corpus contains a few examples of ditransitive clauses, two of
which are presented here. Note that both of them lack an overt subject.
(448)Xoxomedükuŋge.xoxomedükũ-gebarksagoput-N1.RLS[SG]‘He puts sago in the bark’ (2.114)
(449)Osudukefeküdawotoxopòmuededekosu-du=kefeküdawotoxopòmuede-de=kgo.up-SS-CON3SGyounger.siblingsago.grubsomegive-SS=CONkimidikeŋgenã.kimi-di=kẽ-ge-nãroast-SS=CONeat-N1.RLS-N1PL‘She goes up and gives her younger sister some (of the) sago grubs, and they roast
them and they eat.’ (1.054)Drabbe writes that the normal order in clauses is subject, object, verb.
Expressions of time usually come in first position, while expressions of
place follow the subject. If we have two non-subject arguments, their
mutual order is free. According to Drabbe, the NP directly preceding the
verb receives more emphasis. Thus, in (450) below, it is emphasized that it
is ‘to my wife’ that the taro are given, more than what is given. Following
traditional terminology, Drabbe describes the recipient as the indirect object
and the gift as the direct object. We will follow Drabbe at this point.198
198It should be noted that the terms subject, direct object and indirect object are generallytaken as indications of grammatical roles, which intermediate between semantic roles (like
Agent, Recipient) and pragmatic roles (like topic, focus, pragmatic pivot; cf. Andrews
2007). One should, therefore, have formal grammatical criteria to distinguish between
grammatical roles like direct object and indirect object, and not semantic criteria like
‘referring to a recipient’ versus ‘referring to the undergoer’. We have insufficient data,276(450)PART I: GRAMMAR.

1957:43b)In addition to order, the syntactic function of noun phrases (including
pronouns) may be indicated by case markers: the nominative marker te or
the accusative marker ke; That they should be analyzed as case markers is
further explained in 4.4. These markers are optional, and do not need to be
used when the function of the NP is clear from the context. Their precise
pragmatic function remains unclear. It is important to note, however, that
the use of te seems to be restricted to humans and larger animals: this is
stated explicitly by Drabbe for its use in non-verbal clauses, but might be
true for its use in verbal clauses too.199however, to find these grammatical criteria. Moreover, many of these criteria, like
coreference relations in clause linking, can only be found out in fieldwork experiments, by
asking informants for grammaticality judgments etc. As this is not possible, it seems most
practical to follow Drabbe’s terminology, and use a loose semantic criterion to distinguish
between the two roles.
199Because Drabbe does not state this for verbal clauses, however, this is not more than anassumption. The text corpus contains only two examples of nominative te (2.074 and
7.065), which happen to be cases of reference to humans.","[292, 293, 294]"
"3.2.3.1 Te and ke as case markers and focus markers
Drabbe 1957: section 11-12, p. 6a-7aConsider the following table, which summarizes Drabbe’s exposition on
pronouns.
Table 43: Distribution of free pronouns according to DrabbeSubject of verbal1 + 2, 3PL +3SG +optional ke or teobligatory te or kePronoun (+ te)efe + te / ke
ekepredicate
(In)direct objectPronoun (+ ke)Nominal predicatePronoun (+ ke / te)The story for all pronouns except 3SG, as presented by Drabbe, is rather
straightforward. Like nouns, discussed in 3.1.7, in verbal subject position
they may be accompanied by an optional nominative marker te, while as a
direct or indirect object they may combine with an accusative marker ke. In
nonverbal clauses, discussed in 4.2.1 and 4.4, they may combine with the
nominative case marker te or with the focus marker ke. As stated above,182PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classeshowever, Drabbe’s claims about free personal pronouns in other than 3rd
person can hardly be checked, due to lack of data. We now turn to the use
and distribution of the 3SG pronouns efe and eke, which deserve a more
elaborate discussion.3.2.3.2 3rd person pronouns efe and eke
Drabbe 1957: section 12, p. 6b-7aThis section take the use of 3rd person pronouns as attested in the text
corpus as a starting point, and then returns to what Drabbe writes about
them. Although I will not go deeply into the definition of focus, I believe
that the overview of contexts in which eke and efe are used justifies my
analysis of eke as a contracted form of efe plus ke and as a focused form ofefe.
We first consider the use of efe 3SG. In over ninety percent of all
attestations, efe is used as part of the possessive construction illustrated in
3.2.2 above. If we consider these possessive constructions more closely, it
becomes apparent that in the majority of cases we have to do with reference
to one out of two persons in a dyadic kinship relation (see Figure 12 in
3.1.4). The following two sentences illustrate this typical use of efe. We
find the expressions efe küda ‘her younger sibling’ and efe n-eni ‘her elder
sister’ throughout the story to refer to either one of the two sisters.","[199, 200]"

the entire text collection, all lexical material, and the grammatical analysis
of Drabbe (1957) available to a wider public, including those who are not
competent in Dutch. Although the present book is entirely based on Drabbe
(1957), and generally follows his grammatical analysis rather closely, at
points I have added some of my own insights, or tried to make a connection
with relevant developments in linguistic theory that have taken place since
the Fifties (e.g. a growing understanding of clause chaining and switch
reference).
This adaptation has been written as part of the project The Awyu Dumutfamily of Papuan languages in its linguistic and cultural context. In this
project the different languages that are part of the Greater Awyu language
group have been compared, and documented in more detail.5 At times, I
have made reference to other publications that have resulted from this
project, especially where new insights shed light on analytical problems
within Aghu.
Great care has been taken to indicate clearly in the text where my analysis
differs from Drabbe’s. At the same time, in order to enhance the
comparison between this book and the original, each section closes with a
list of references to the corresponding sections in Drabbe (1957). The
structure of this book follows that of Drabbe: Part I, consisting of chapters5This project took place at the VU University of Amsterdam, and was supported by De NederlandseOrganisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, reference number 380-89-020.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

again makes more sense than the analysis as a case marker. This is mainly
because in non-verbal clauses we cannot find a grammatical opposition
between the use of ke and the use of te as we found in verbal clauses.
Examples of the use of ke marking a complement are found in (464)-(467)
above, the last of which has been copied here as (526).218

verbal clauses, always in combination with a free pronoun, and often
followed by ta. This was discussed extensively in Chapter 3; the use of eke,
a cliticized form efe ‘3SG’ plus ke ‘FOC’, was discussed in 3.2.3.2, while theuse of ke ‘FOC’ in combination with other pronouns came along in the218Dixon (2010b:159 f.) refers to copula as copula verbs and to the predicate as the copulacomplement. He writes that cross-linguistically copula complements are often not casemarked at all. He also points out, however, that we find other possibilities, like some
Eastern European languages where copula complements can be marked either with
nominative, or with oblique case, dependent on the nature of the relation: permanent or
temporary (ibid: 170). From a functional point of view, it is not so surprising that a copula
complement can be marked either way: it has the same referent as the subject-topic, but
generally refers to an object that is affected, which is typical for objects. In Aghu we find
all three possibilities: no marking, marking with a a nominative marker te (which usually
marks subjects), and marking with a focus marker ke, possibly historically related to an
accusative marker ke (which usually marks objects).","[319, 320]"

In (250) below, the demonstrative pronoun takes the position of the

the possessive linker shows that we have to do here with a possessive
construction (cf. 3.1.2).

"The quote above summarizes the main point: clauses headed by less
inflected verbs depend for their interpretation on the next fully inflected
verb to their right, but are at the same time not a constituent of the clause
containing the fully inflected verb. Following Foley (2010), these clauses
are probably better characterized as coordinate rather than subordinate.223
223It is not so easy to prove, however, that the dependent clauses in Aghu are coordinaterather than subordinate. According to Foley (2010), subordinate clauses are always
constituents of the main clause: either as a core argument, in which case they are
complement clauses; or as oblique arguments, in which case they are adverbial subordinate
clauses, or as modifier of a nominal constituent, in which case they are relative clauses.
One could state, therefore, that subordinate clauses, are ‘nominalized’, or — generally —
formally marked as noun phrases.
While in certain other Awyu-Dumut languages dependent clauses can be contrasted with
subordinate structures in which the clause is nominalized (cf. Wester 2014: 158 f.; de Vries
2005:372-377), this is not the case in Aghu; it is impossible to use language-internal
criteria to contrast the dependent clauses under discussion here with subordinate clauses.
Still, it makes more sense to consider them coordinate rather than subordinate. The main
reasons for this are the following: (1) There is simply no evidence that the clauses are
embedded in the following clause with fully inflected verb, and there is no evidence that
the clauses are nominalized (unless we follow Drabbe’s analysis of ke, see below); (2)
Drabbe never translates the dependent clauses in Aghu as complement clauses or relative
clauses, which — as stated by Foley 2010:32 — are typical functions of subordinate
clauses in Papuan languages. Although it is true that translations can never be taken as
evidence for the existence or non-existence of a certain grammatical construction, I
nevertheless believe that the total lack of relative and complement clauses in the Dutch
translation is telling; (3) although Drabbe refers to the nonfinite forms as deelwoordenPART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations3135.4 Aghu and switch reference
As stated in the previous section, switch reference systems typically appear
in clause-chaining languages. As argued in de Vries (2010), who modifies a
theory set out in in Haiman and Munro (1983), clause chaining structures
are the result of coordination reduction in thematic continuity conditions,
where the basic principle is that those operators that are consistent over the
clauses are marked only on the verb of the final clause. De Vries shows
how, for Dumut languages, reduction took place in a diachronic process, in
cases where the operators of tense, mood and subject of a series of clauses
were continuous. In this process, verbs in SS conditions were the first to be
reduced and to become part of a chaining structure. Present Dumut
languages show the traces of this diachronic process: All Dumut languages
have dedicated nonfinite SS forms, which lack a specification for tense,
mood and person, while only some have dedicated DS forms. These DS
forms have grown from the non-reduced forms when used as non-final verb
in a series of clauses; as the use of reduced forms was restricted to SS
conditions, the non-reduced forms came to be associated with DS conditions.
In Dumut languages, then, we find (apart from the tensed forms which(‘participles’), he places the words in apostrophes to show that they are different from
participles. The difference may very well be that participles are embedded while nonfinites
are not; (4) There are very clear cases where nonfinite clauses present foreground
information, e.g. in the durative constructions discussed in Durative aspect expressed by
constructions with posture verbs and at the end of 5.4.1.1. This is very unusual for
subordinate structures (cf. Dooley 2010). With regard to the first point, it should be noted
that the connective =k that is optionally used after nonfinites is considered by Drabbe the
same as the oblique marker ke used after nouns. Although it cannot be excluded that there
is a diachronic connection between the two particles, I believe that the two particles
synchronically have very different functions. The use of =k after nonfinite verbs cannot
be used, therefore, as an argument that the nonfinite clause would have been nominalized,
and that it would, therefore, be in a subordinate relation to the final clause.","[330, 331]"
"Coming to the distribution of verbal nouns, their distribution comes close to
that of nouns:
a. they can be argument (subject or object) of a predicate;
b. they can be predicated over by means of the predicator de;
c. they can be marked for (dative) case;
d. they can take the position of the possessed noun in a
possessive construction; vowel initial verbs in this position
combine with the possessive linker nThey differ from nouns, however, in that they can also be predicated over
by oxo, a predicator that is otherwise never used for nouns, but only for the
predication of adjectives and numerals (cf. section 4.2.2 and 4.2.3). The
remainder of this section will first discuss and illustrate the different
distributional properties of verbal nouns mentioned above, and then give
some additional contexts in which they are used. We will begin, therefore,
with contexts in which the verbal nouns clearly take a position usually
reserved for nouns.",[73]

meoxokeü-gewhoACCstab-N1.RLS[SG]‘*Who has stabbed someone?’ / Whom has he stabbed)?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)As can be seen in (266)a - c below, in nominal predicates, interrogative
pronouns obligatorily combine with te or ke. In this respect, they differ
from nouns, where the use of te or ke is optional. The difference between
the use of te and ke is not clear, but their function is clearly not to
differentiate between different syntactic roles. It is more likely that their use
has to do with the type of focus, but we have insufficient data to say
anything more about the respective roles of ke and te with any certainty.155

word] differs from the presupposition [WvdH: the fact that there is someone]’ (cf.
Lambrecht 1994:213). This may explain the use of ke. Whereas te is not a focus marker, it
is not incompatible with focus, and it is not unthinkable that te would represent a different
tye of focus than ke, like presentational or thetic focus, with the focus on the predicate as a
whole. With the little data that we have, however, we can only speculate about this
difference.","[217, 218]"

"300PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureThe most convincing arguments in favor of ke and te as case markers are
the following. First, Drabbe gives some contrastive examples in which the
markers serve to disambiguate between the syntactic roles of subject and
object. A very convincing example, which was given in 3.1.5 and is
repeated here, is the following:
(523)anan-amset=ed-oxe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childNOMgive-N1.RLS-N1PL‘my children gave it’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
bnan-amsek=ed-oxe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childACCgive-N1.RLS-N1PL‘they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)Second, the case markers are in complementary distribution with other case
markers, discussed in 3.6.
Nevertheless, the case markers are somewhat atypical. First, they are
optional, so that the following sentence, minimally differing from (523)a
and b, is also grammatical.
cnan-amseed-oxe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childgive-N1.RLS-N1PL‘my children gave it / they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)Their optional nature raises the question about the precise motivation for
their use. One might hypothesize that they are used only when an NP’s
function is not clear from the context. This cannot explain, however, why it
is also possible to use these markers in case the verb has only one
argument, whose role can only be that of a subject, as in the following
example:PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure
(524)nan-amseteda-xe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childNOMcome-N1.RLS-N1PL301‘my children have come’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)This example shows that the use of te cannot fully be explained from its
function as disambiguator between the syntactic roles of subject and object;
it must also have a pragmatic function. As our data are too limited — we
especially lack minimally contrastive examples and descriptions of their
meaning differences — we have to remain ignorant about the nature of this
pragmatic function. In verbal clauses, therefore, we analyze te and ke as
case markers, the use of which is also guided by pragmatic factors that
remain to be investigated.216
In nonverbal clauses, the use of te and ke again is optional, except in
clauses with meoxo ‘who’ as a subject, where it is obligatory.217 As was
shown in 4.2, both te and ke may be used either in subject position or as
marker of the copula complement. Te is consistently analyzed as a
nominative marker. Ke, however, is analyzed as a a focus marker. This
shown in the following table:
Table 54: Analysis of ke and te in nonverbal clauseste, analyzed aske analyzed asIn subject positionNominative case markerFocus markerAs a complementNominative case markerFocus markerConsidering ke in subject position, my main argument to analyze it as a
focus marker is of a negative nature, in that it is hard to think of ke as an
accusative marker:
216An interesting example of the use of ke is found in 3.024, which was cited in 4.1 above,example (452).
217Nominal clauses with meoxo as a subject were discussed in 3.2.5.1.","[317, 318, 319]"
"3.1.5.5 Associative plural
Nouns referring to larger animals and human beings are often followed by a
3rd person free pronoun, which indicates not only the number of the noun
phrase, but, according to Drabbe, also implies definiteness, to which we
will come back below. He gives the following examples:
(212)xobasĩjoxoteda-xe-nãmen3PLNOMcome-N1.RLS-N1PL‘the men have come’ (Drabbe 1957:5b)
(213)kuso-kamajoxosimarsupial-kind.of.animal3PLaboveoŋgowim-oxe-nã
jump.from.brach.to.branch-N1.RLS-N1PL
‘the cuscus animals jumped from branch to branch’ (Drabbe 1957:5b)In addition to the single example of joxo modifying a non-subject NP,
given in note 123 above, and in addition to the cases where it is used as
part of a possessive construction (see 3.1.2 above), the text corpus contains
ten examples of joxo modifying or following a subject NP.127 In some of
these cases, the NP plus pronoun refer to ‘a person and others associated
with this person’, so that we have to do with an ‘associative plural’:127These are 1.092, 1.137, 1.183, 1.271, 2.162, 6.055, 7.003, 8.014, 8.020, 8.022.",[188]
"4.2 Nonverbal clauses and clauses formed with
ki(k) become
Drabbe 1957: sections 15-17, p. 8-9Just as in verbal clauses, the predicate in nonverbal clauses is always
clause-final. The general clause structure could be described as subject
followed by predicate, where the subject is not necessarily overt, and — ifovert — consists of a noun phrase or a free pronoun. Predicates consist of anoun phrase, adjectival phrase or numeral phrase, followed by a copula de
or oxo, the latter of which is used only in the formation of adjectival and
numeral predicates. Subjects are optionally cliticized either with a focus
marker ke or a nominative marker te, with the latter marker being restricted
to humans and larger animals. In nominal predicates formed with de, the
predicator noun can be marked by the case markers te ‘NOM’ or by thefocus marker ke ‘FOC’, with the same restriction that te is restricted to
larger animals and humans (see 4.4 for the analysis of ke as a focus marker
in this context). The rest of this section will consider the different types of
predicates one by one. Before we continue, however, it should be noted that
the nonverbal clauses under discussion here may only have a past or a
present interpretation. For reference to future one has to use a clause
formed with a semifinite or finite irrealis form of ki(k) ‘become’, discussed
in 4.2.6, or to use a copulative posture verb, as discussed in 2.8.2.",[301]
"280PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureargument, which can best be characterized as (subtype of the category of)
experiencer: it is sentient, not instigating the event, and affected by the
event. Pragmatically, this experiencer is the topic, representing what the
sentence is about. On the basis of its pragmatics, therefore, one would
expect it to be realized as a subject, as there is a strong association between
‘being the subject’ and ‘being the (sentential) topic’. 202 Semantically,
however, the experiencer deviates from the prototypical semantic properties
associated with subjects (sentient, but instigating and not affected), and is
actually closer to the semantic prototype of objects. 203 This section
describes the solution developed in the Aghu language to deal with this
tension.
In Aghu, there is a split in behavior between singular and 1PL experiencerarguments on the one hand, and N1 plural arguments on the other hand.
When the relevant argument belongs to the first category, the language uses
an ‘experiential construction’, which reflects the semantic nature of the
experiencer as being more closely associated with objects than with
subjects. The verb has (impersonal) 3SG inflection, while the argument is
optionally marked as accusative, by the use of the postpositional case
marker ke ‘ACC’. This is illustrated in (455) below. When the argument is
N1 plural, however, it behaves as a normal subject in a normal verbalclause: the subject is optionally marked as nominative by the use of te,
while verbal inflection is N1PL, showing agreement with the subject. This is
illustrated in (456).","[297, 298]"
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes205Two other interrogative forms discussed by Drabbe are makumu, andmakumã, which according to Drabbe mean ‘how, how many, where, when’.
To generalize over all these contextual inferences, I will use the gloss
‘how/where/when’. To these two forms Drabbe adds a third one, mamã,which is another form that can be used to inform after someone’s place ofliving.159 Finally, we find the form maketa ‘what’, to which we will come
back at the end of this section. Drabbe analyzes the form makumu as an
adverb, in line with the adverbs in mu discussed in 3.4.2, and makumã as a
verbal noun. Following Drabbe at this point we would expect makumã to
exhibit more nominal properties than makumu. We will see that this is
indeed seems to be the case. Unlike makumu, both makumã and mamã may
be marked for accusative case (see (287)), are used as part of a possessive
construction (see (288) and (289)), and as a copula complement ((297)a, b).
All the interrogative forms can be used either independently, or —analogous to makeaxe above — adnominally.","[222, 223]"

In the noun phrases efe küda and efe joxo the pronoun efe functions as a

"3.1.2 Possessive construction
Drabbe 1957: section 8, p. 4b/5aThe structure of an Aghu possessive construction is shown in Figure 11,
which shows a possessive construction in which both the possessor position
and the position referring to the possessed are filled by a full NP. For cases
where the possessor is expressed by a pronoun only, the reader is referred
to section 3.2.2. For possessive affixes on kinship terms see section 3.1.4.
In the construction shown here, main stress is on the noun corresponding to
the possessed. We will first confine ourselves to cases where the NP
consists of a noun only. Cases where NP1 and NP2 are more complex will
be illustrated further below, when we come to the discussion of nested
possessive constructions.which can be considered as a special type of exocentric compounds — for Yonggom
Wambon, Mandobo and Kombai. In the Aghu data available to us, no coordinate
compounds were attested.
112In certain cases, however, nominal compounds have been written without a hyphen (orblank space) separating the parts. In those cases it has always been made clear, either in
the glossing or in additional explanation, that the word is a compound. An example ismubigi [mu.bigi] ‘keel’ in 4.58, where the running text has mubigi, the first line of the
gloss has mu.bigi, the second line has ‘keel, and where a note is added that the word is
considered by Drabbe as a compound.",[167]

to that in (366) above, the difference being that now the event is described
from an inside perspective, using büsiü womu as a target of mi ‘comedown’ (so that the person is perceived of as coming down into the house’)
rather than as target of ogü ‘go into’ (where we have a deictic center
outside the house).

(1.203)For the noun mo ‘backside, behind’, the spatial meaning has been
metaphorically extended to the category of time. Here the noun is clearly
used adverbially, or may be said to have developed into an adverb. This is
probably also the case in (368) above.

of a core argument (S, A, or O) and /or to mark spatial, temporal, and other
relations on peripheral arguments” (Dixon 2010:224).177 The table below

many uses of verbal nouns that are specific to the category. The rest of this

"PART II: WORDLISTS. Aghu-English wordlist
reference to the wordlist means that the item was not attested in this list,
but only in one or more of the other sources. See, for example, abi or
abibiamV. Coming back to the references in non-bold, the following
method was followed. If an item was attested in the text corpus, I have
always added at least one reference to a place of occurence. In addition, I
have added references to sections in Drabbe or in this publication, only in
those cases where the form was not attested in the text corpus, or in cases
where these extra references were considered useful for the reader.
Verbs are given in their stem_I form; the form of the realis marker is given
in brackets, directly following the stem; cf. section 2.3.1.1. For the
corresponding forms of stem_II and the imperative stems, the reader is
referred to sections 2.2 and 2.5 respectively. For stems in -mV (where V is
a harmonizing vowel, cf. section 1.3) and those ending in nasal vowel, the
forms of the realis marker are predictable (-ox and -g, respectively, see
section 2.3.1.1), and, therefore, not indicated. Iterative stems have also not
been included; these can be found in section 2.4.1.
The words are presented in alphabetical order, where the mutual order of
unmodified vowels, nasal vowels and long vowels is random. For example,the order of ã, a and ā is random (all count as a). The same is true for the
mutual order of u and ü: both count as u. The consonant x ([x]) counts as
the English consonant x: it follows the consonant w and precedes z (y is not
attested in Aghu). Compounds directly follow the (first) word with which
they form a compound, so that e.g. a-müto is presented higher in the
alphabetical list than a word like abi.
Although Drabbe discusses the different parts of speech, and is aware that
there is not a one to one correspondence between parts of speech in Dutch
and in Aghu, he has refrained from giving the part of speech for each stem.
This means that the indication of the part of speech in this publication is389390PART II: WORDLISTS. Aghu-English wordlistsometimes not more than an ‘informed guess.’ An exception is formed by
words belonging to the class of verbs, as they can be formally
dinstuinguished from other forms by having a realis marker. Also formally
distinguishable are those adverbs that end in -mu. Apart from these verbs
and adverbs, the indicaton of membership is based on the meaning of the
form, based on the class membership indicated by Drabbe, or based on the
use of the form in the text corpus. In those cases where neither of these
criteria is sufficient, I have placed a question mark, as in the examples
presented below. The question mark proceeding n at ake indicates that it
might be a noun. As is clear from the remark, however, it is not attested as
an independent noun, so that it is only the analogy to other compounds
(where the second position is filled by a noun, cf. section 3.1) that would
justify the analysis of ake as a noun. The question mark after akimu
indicates that the part of speech is unclear. As indicated in the explanatory
remark, the word is attested only in combination with a following verb ogü,
and not attested independently. (It could be an adverb in -mu (cf. section
3.4.2), but lack of comparable forms, e.g. forms from which the adverb
could have been derived, makes this rather hypothetical.)Figure 20: part of the Aghu-English wordlist, with indication of the use of question marksThe translations in this word list are not always exactly the same as those
that we find as glosses in the text corpus. This is because the glossing in the
text corpus suffers from technical limitations, like the impossibility to use
multi-word descriptions in interlinear glossing, or the wish to keep the
glosses as compact as possible.","[406, 407, 408]"

Kiawi says: “I will stay (here)!” (2.199)We find a second case of a future in the text about the two orphan girls,
who find a boy at the place where one of the two cut her hand. They say
that they will ‘take’ the child, meaning that they will accept it as a child.
Both in this and in the preceding example, the future verb seems to refer
not so much to an event or situation that will take place only in the future,
but to something that will hold true from the moment of speaking onwards.

attestation of a future form. Here the future verb is the head of a
complement clause, the main clause being headed by an inflected form of
the auxiliary verb mV ‘do’. The construction is parallel to the construction
in which the complement clause is headed by a verbal noun, as described in
2.3.2.2. In constructions like this, main clause plus complement clause
together express an intention or a ‘being about to’ to do something.

human feet” (lit. they will put their feet down and it will lie), and starts
searching.’(2.160)Drabbe remarks that here the future is used in a way in which the future
can also be used in Dutch: ‘er zullen wel voetsporen zijn’, or, in English‘there will probably be footprints’. The future, used as part of a quote, thus
expresses a degree of certainty from the part of the speaker (enough to
make him search for the track), and forms an affirmation from the part of
the speaker (in this case to himself) that a certain situation will probably be
the case.
It is clear that the data is far too scarce to make any reliable claims about
the meaning of the future, or to deviate from Drabbe’s interpretation. I do
believe, however, that future investigation of the future should bear the
following factors in mind:
(1) The use of a ‘future’ suffix -e is not needed for a future interpretation;
the bare semifinite irrealis already implies a future reading80PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs(2) It might very well be that suffixation with -e is used to express a certain
degree of certainty or assurance from the part of the speaker, rather than a
future tense. In this respect it is important to note that the ‘future’ suffix -e
follows the person-number markers, unlike the tense affixes -k and -dia,
which precede the suffix. This might be seen as iconically reflecting the
fact that evaluative modal operators operate at a higher level (the level of
the entire proposition) than the more objective operators of tense (which, to
follow Dik’s terminology, operate at the level of the State of Affairs, cf.
Dik 1997: 236-243, 295-296). 62
2.3.3.3 Summary about tense
Summarizing, tense is a very marginal category in Aghu, and the attested
cases of fully finite forms are few. It is clear that tense hardly plays a role
within the narratives available to us. Of the distant past forms the text
corpus contains only a handful of cases, in constructions where the
temporal meaning is bleached. Historical past forms are attested only in the
concluding sections of the narratives, and might possibly be thought of as a
means to place the stories in a mythical past. Future forms, finally, are very
rare too, largely due to the narrative genre with only little direct speech.
More investigation, especially of texts from other genres, would be needed
in order to get a better grasp of the Aghu tense system, and to see whether
its classification as a category of tense does indeed most justice to its
function.","[95, 96, 97, 98]"

repetition of an earlier event. It is also used in cases where the same event is performed on
a different object, e.g. in 2.094, where first some moldered wood is brought up, and now
(again / also) a stick. In such cases, we would use 'also' in English, instead of 'again'. This

bringing up is modified), and not the entire clause (which includes the object).","[229, 230]"
"189In fact, I get the strong impression that in most of the cases attested in the text corpus,the function of the ‘quantifier’ is not to quantify or modify the noun. It seems rather the
case that the first noun presents the sentire set, after which the quantifier specifies a subset.
Thus, in many cases the rendering of the logical structure of the expression should be
something like ‘some of N’ or ‘all of N’, rather than ‘some N’ or ‘all N’.",[278]

As is common in many Papuan languages, Awyu-Dumut languages make
elaborate use of tail-head linkage. In this discourse strategy, the last clause
of a clause chain or sentence is partially or completely repeated at the
beginning of the next clause chain (cf. de Vries 2005:363). Consider the
passage below, which illustrates a number of important principles.
First, the majority of head clauses that pick up the tail clause of the
preceding clause chain or sentence are nonfinite SS forms, chained to thePART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations343following clause.253 Examples are akusunuk in (591), kunuk in (595) andgünd in (596). This pattern is in line with the observation by de Vries that
“the default form of the recapitulated head clause follows from the defaultor unmarked form of clause linkage in that language” (de Vries 2005:372;
2006:817). Another technique is to repeat the final verb of the tail literally,
something we see in the case of güŋge in (594). Third, it can be seen that
tail-head linkage is an optional and ‘creative’ process. In (592) we see that
the sequence of sentences that is linked by tail-head linkage is interrupted
by the semifinite verb akusuŋge, a form that was also used as the final verb
of (590). Following this, the verb onok in (593) picks up the tail of (591),
after which we find a further sequence of tail-head linked sentences. Not
illustrated here but attested elsewhere in the text corpus are cases where
also the object noun of a preceding sentence is repeated, or cases where the
last two clauses are repeated. 254 These phenomena show that tail-head
linkage should be seen as a discourse strategy or discourse preference,
rather than as part of sentence grammar (de Vries 2005:364).
(590)Afünd=
afü̃-d=smooth-SS=emedekakusuŋge.eme-de=kakusũ-gefinish-SS=CONhide-N1.RLS[SG]‘After he has smoothed it [a piece of wood], he hides it.’ (1.119)253Wester (2014:171f) describes how Awyu-Dumut languages exhibit two types of tail-head linkage. All Awyu-Dumut languages have chained tail-head linkage. Most of them
also have thematic tail-head linkage, where the ‘head’ is closed off by a thematic marker.
Aghu, however, only has chained tail-head linkage, as it does not have thematic markers.
254(Possible) examples of the repetition of an object noun are found in 1.047-1.048; 1.057-1.058; 1.091-1.092; 1.150-1.151; 1.53-54; 1.177-78. An example of the repetition of twoclauses is found in the heads abu dadek in 1.165, ab’suke in 1.166, andpemoxo midik in

"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure289Example (480) has been taken from another text. In the passage preceding
the sentences below, it has been narrated how the father’s daughter
Okudukake has put pieces of sago cake all over the place. When the father
comes home, he concludes — as narrated in (479) — that his daughter must
have been eating sago, and that, see (480), the sago must be very good. The
adjective is modified twice, both by isiom(u) and by püsiü.

Drabbe 1957: section 15, p. 8Numeral clauses are formed fully analogous to adjectival clauses, with
either oxo or de as a copula. Here too, in case the copula is de, the
predicative numeral can be marked for focus (by ke) or for nominative case
(by te), the latter only in case the subject is a larger animal or human. Thus,
in (481) the predicate can only be marked for focus, while in
also the nominative marker te can be used, in case reference is made to
humans or larger animals.

marker *de. Adjectival clauses are negated in the same way as nominal
clauses; an example is given in (485). Drabbe does not discuss the negation
of numeral clauses.

well-defined, well-bound — and therefore countable — quantity of the

in the following cases. Apart of these two examples, no occurences of this
use were attested.

definiteness is an integral part of grammar, the expression of definiteness is not obligatory
and not part of a well-defined paradigm of formal oppositions. Coming back to Jakobson’s

As will be set out in the chapter on clause combinations, clauses are
generally linked asyndetically. This means that the use of conjunctions to
connect clauses is rare. Whether this is also true for noun phrases is hard to
say, as the text corpus does not contain examples of conjoined noun
phrases, neither asyndetically, nor syndetically. In Drabbe’s description,
however, we find a presentation of both NP conjoining and clause
conjoining conjunctions. These are presented in 3.8.1 and 3.8.2,
respectively.","[272, 273]"
"3.2.4.2 Use (distribution)

Adnominal use can be observed in (243) through (248), where the first four
sentences have basic demonstratives, and the final two have compound
demonstratives. Adnominal demonstrative pronouns follow the noun that
they modify.

case of another demonstrative pronoun that is used adnominally:

following four uses, not meant to be exhaustive. The different uses will be
illustrated below, in reverse order.

"4.2.1 Nominal clauses, formed with copula de
Drabbe 1957: section 15, p. 8a-bNominal clauses are always formed with the copula de. Semantically, they

we find the focus marker ke; the use of te would be ungrammatical. In the
examples (464), (466), and (467) below, we find the same markers te or ke
not as modification of the subject, but as part of the nominal predicate, or

the copula complement.

Drabbe 1957: section 15, p. 8Adjectival clauses can be formed either with the copula de or with the
copula oxo. In predicates formed with de, the adjective is optionally
modified by the focus marker ke.207 Some examples of adjectival clauses206In a note to this verse it is noted that the she does not immediately recognize the man asher husband, even though the addressees (those who listen to the story) are informed that it
is her husband that she sees. First she gets afraid, and does not recognize him yet, and only
in 6.200c she really recognizes that it is her husband.
207Although it may be strange at first sight to see focus markers combined with adjectives,I believe constructions like these can be thought of as having an incomplete or headless NP
as a predicate, so that a sentence like (473) could also be translated as ‘that man there is astrong one’. This is confirmed by the fact that it is also possible to have an NP plusadjective as a predicate, as in the example below (which is analogous to (477), where we
have a similar construction with the copula oxo):PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure287formed with de are given here, where (473) contains an example of an
adjective marked by ke.

(473)axuxokoaŋ(ge)dehumanDSTstrongFOCCOP‘that man there is strong’ (Drabbe 1957:8b)Interestingly, Drabbe seems to contradict himself when he points out that
adjectives can only be modified marked with ke and not with te. In spite of
Drabbe’s claim that adjectives do not combine with te, he gives several
examples where this is the case, like (474) below.
(474)axuxokoãtedehumanDSTstrongNOMCOP‘that man there is strong’ (Drabbe 1957:8b)Adjectival clauses can also be formed with copula oxo. Unlike clauses
formed with copula de, in these clauses adjectives cannot be marked for
case. Two examples of adjectival predicates are given with (475) and (476)
below, the first of which is fully analogous to (472) above.

Chapter 4: Clause structurexamikioxo.xamikioxotrueCOP‘It is true.’ (1.034)Drabbe points out that the copula oxo can not only be used for the
formation of adjectival clauses (and numeral clauses, see below), but also
for nominal clauses in which the predicate nominal is modified by an
adjective. An example of such a construction is the following.
(477)xofe208teaxukoanoxo3SGNOMhumanstrongCOP‘that one there is strong man’ (Drabbe 1957:8b)The remainder of this section presents some of the adjectival clauses withoxo that were attested in the text corpus. First consider (478). The subject
of the clause is formed by the noun phrase headed by kokü ‘belly’. As we
do not have access to the intonational pattern of the language, it is not clear
whether we have to do with one complex possessive NP running fromAtumio through kokü (‘the bellies of the clan mates of Atumio’) or with a
construction in which Atumio through naxu is extra-clausal, setting the
theme for the rest of the clause, so that the clause should be read as ‘as forAtumio’s clan mates, the bellies were very big’. The predicate is formed byisiom= tadixa oxo, where isiom= serves as an adverbial modifier of
tadixa.
(478)Atumioefenaxukoküisiom'tadixaoxo.","[301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306]"
"3.1.3 Possessive constructions with nisi
Drabbe 1957: section 16, p. 9a; section 23, p. 11aDrabbe describes the meaning of nisi as ‘owner’. In its semantic structure, a
construction with nisi is similar to a compound of type 1 in that the
modifying part precedes the head. It is different from this type of
compounds, however, in that the modifier can also be an entire clause.
While an example like (177) below shows that the modifier may be a noun,
in most of the examples provided by Drabbe and in all the examples
attested in the text corpus, the modifier is a clause.
(177)büsiünisibo-de116houseownersit-1.RLS[SG]‘I am the owner of the house’ (Drabbe 1957:11b)In case nisi is preceded directly by a verb, it causes word stress to shift
from the ultimate to the penultimate syllable of the word, see e.g. sìke in
(179) below. Example (178) represents a case where the position of the
possessed is filled by a nonverbal clause. In all other examples that follow,
the position is filled by verbal clauses.",[172]
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes189The text corpus contains no examples of efe or eke as (in)direct object or
used in a nominal clause, although these uses are mentioned by Drabbe (cf.
Table 43 in 3.2.3.1 above). This may, therefore, very well be due to lack of
data.
Conclusively, we can state that efe and eke differ in their distribution. Efe
is used mainly to refer to the possessor in a possessive construction. In
addition, it is attested only four times in subject position: once followed by
the nominative marker te, and three times followed by ke ta FOC IN.TURN, in
which case the expression seems equivalent to eke ta. Eke, on the other
hand, is used in combination with ta IN.TURN in the majority of cases, and
attested in the text corpus exclusively in subject position. Also in cases
without ta we have to do with events where one out of two topical
participants is reintroduced, reactivated, or contrasted with the other one,
which is the reason why I have glossed eke as a focused form of efe.","[206, 207]"

"Coming back to the tendency in Papuan languages to avoid a stacking of
(pro)nouns for referent tracking, it should be pointed out that Aghu has278PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structuredeveloped an effective way of referent tracking: In addition to the inflection
of person and number on the verb, the language has developed a switch
reference system, with nonfinites indicating same subject (SS), and
semifinites implying different subject (DS). More on this can be found in
chapter 5, especially 5.4.
To conclude, it should be noted that the word order as described by Drabbe
is not without exception. The text corpus does contain a number of
examples where the object precedes the subject. One of these cases is
presented below. Although the number of examples is too small to draw
any rigid conclusions on factors influencing word order, it is not unlikely
that in a case like (453) the initial position of the indirect object has to do
with its topicality. The sentence is about the two boys who have received
food (from a parrot), even though the two are not framed here as a subject
(which is the grammatical role that usually coincides with the pragmatic
role of topic (cf. footnote 202)).

adds a footnote stating that this is not the normal word order and that the
translation should be as given below.200 His translation can be seen as a
clear indication that also here the deviating word order has to do with the
topicality of the object.

(6.202)4.1.1 Experiential clauses
Drabbe 1957: section 60, p. 23b-24aLike many Papuan languages, 201 Aghu has a number of ‘experiential verbs’,
which are listed below. Semantically, these verbs have at least one200“En de spullen, die neemt de vrouw over” (Drabbe 1957:87, note 127).","[295, 296, 297]"

only four attestations of efe in the entire corpus. In only one case, the
pronoun efe is followed by te, which is the nominative marker that is also
optionally used after other pronouns or nouns in subject position (see
above). The sentence is part of narrative 2; father and mother have just put
their penis gourd and their skirt in a water quiver. They tell the children to
watch these objects; if they start to perish, then they know that Apupüsimo
has killed them:

In all other cases, three in total, we find efe preceded
by a NP and followed by ke ta FOC IN.TURN. The context of use of efe ke ta
is identical to that of the far more frequent eke ta, which will be discussed
below.140
Turning to the use of eke, its distribution as attested in the text corpus can
be summarized as follows:140We will come back to the use of NP efe ke ta in note 141 below.","[200, 201]"
"177Dixon stresses that case may be expressed in different ways: either as affixes (ideallyand typically called case inflection, or as clitics (ideally called case clitics, typically called
case or apposition), or — as is the case in Aghu — as grammatical words, in which case
they are ideally called case words, and typically called adpositions. This book uses the
term postpositional case marker, to express both its realization as a grammatical word that
directly follows the NP and to express its function as a case marker.",[258]
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes1653.1.5.3 Nouns in non-subject function
We now come to cases where nouns or NP’s are used in other than subjectposition. Here, singular number may be specified by the use of fe ‘3SG’,
while plurality may be expressed by the use of a 3PL pronoun following the
noun. Of the latter the text corpus contains only one example, however.123
In my view, fe functions as a marker of singular number, which expresses
that reference is made to one token out of a set of tokens of the same type.
This makes my analysis somewhat different from Drabbe, who states that fe
“actually means ‘other’”:
“Where we use an indefinite pronoun, we sometimes find fe, used both in combinationwith things and with persons. The actual meaning is ‘other’; büsiü fe may mean ‘the otherhouse’, ‘another house’ but also ‘a house’.”124123Other than in this book, Drabbe does not make a systematic distinction between nounsused as subject and nouns in other functions. On the basis of Drabbe’s discussion, onemight conclude that nouns can be specified for plural number by the use of joxo ‘3PL’irrespective of their syntactic or semantic function. NP’s in fe, however, are attested innon-subject position only. In the data available to us, we have only one example of a nonsubject modified by joxo:
(...)efenapigijoxoedoxeneeŋgenã.efen-api-gijoxoed-oxe -neẽ -ge-nã3SGLNK-mother-PL3PLgive-N1.RLS -DS eat-N1.RLS -N1PL‘He gives his mothers and the two of them eat.’ (1.095)
More on joxo, especially its use in subject NP’s can be found in 3.1.5.5 below.
124“Waar wij een onbep. lidw. gebruiken vinden we bij zaken zowel als bij personen weleens fe, dat eigenlijk „andere” betekent; büsjü fe kan betekenen „het andere huis”, „een
ander huis”, maar ook „’n huis.” ” (Drabbe 1957:5b)166PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesThe different ‘meanings’ described by Drabbe are, in my view, allcontextual implications of the use of fe ‘3SG’ and have to do more with the
translation into Dutch than with actual meaning differences. The formative
is often used in series of references to several tokens of the same type. In
these contexts it often refers to ‘another one’ of the same token, or — whenthe series is restricted to two tokens — ‘the other one’, cf. the examples
from (198) onwards.
The formative is used both independently, and in combination with a noun,
but attested in non-subject position only.125 This latter fact can be seen as a
confirmation of my analysis of fe as a marker of singular number; it is only
as a non-subject that number marking makes sense. The number of the
subject is already clear from inflection on the verb, so that marking of
number on the subject-NP is often redundant.126
In (198) we find an example of an independently used fe.
(198)Emuosüdükfeüge.emuosü-dü=kfeü-gethengo.down-SS=CON3SGstab-N1.RLS[SG]Then he goes down [out of the tree] and stabs one. (1.184)In (200), on the other hand, fe is used attributively, modifying the noun wi.

NP1PossessorPART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
(3SG/3PL pronoun)NP2PossessedFigure 11: Possessive construction with full noun phrase in possessor position; main stress
is on NP2The optional pronoun can be either efe ‘3SG’ or joxo ‘3PL’, as in neto efebüsiü [father 3SG house]113 ‘father’s house’ or Ma joxo büsiü [Ma 3PL house]
‘the village of the Ma clan’. Examples without a pronoun are neto xasi
[father spear] ‘father’s spear’; büsiü tò [house opening] ‘the doors and
windows of the house’. It should be noted that in possessive constructionsthe use of the pronoun efe is not restricted to humans and larger animals, as
is the case when it is used in other positions (cf. 3.2.1).
If the possessed noun starts with a vowel, it is obligatorily prefixed with n-,
which will be referred to as a possessive linker and which will be glossed
as LNK.114 The prefix serves to avoid a vowel clash at word boundaries, and113It should be noted that Drabbe’s description contains several examples where vowel-initial kinship nouns alternate with forms in n, without any apparent difference in meaning.
Thus, eto ‘father’ alternates with neto; api ‘mother’ with napi. The origin of vowel-initial n
is unclear. It could either be a grammaticalized form of the first person possessive prefix ndescribed in 3.3, with the meaning of ‘my father’ bleached into ‘father’, or be the
possessive linker described later on in this section, with an unexpressed possessor.
114Drabbe compares this linker to the marker na in Pisa. About this na, Wester remarks thefollowing: “Pisa (...) frequently makes use of a possessive marker na, ‘of’. This na appears
between the two nouns that stand in a possessive relation to each other, for example nabona xãy, literally ‘father of house’, which means ‘father’s house’. The possessive marker na
is also found in Mandobo. (...) There are no occurrences of a possessive marker na
inYonggom Wambon, Digul Wambon or Kombai.” (Wester 2014:53) Wester sees thePART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes151is used within the possessive construction only. Its function is not purely
phonological, as we do find clashes of vowels at word boundaries in other
positions,butormorpho-phonologicalconfined to this specific construction.","[167, 168, 169]"
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs49however, the suffix is realized as -nd= rather than as -nV, as in fi ku-nd=em-oxe [tuber put-SS=finish-N1.RLS[SG]] ‘he had finished planting
tubers’ or dü e-nd=em-oxe [sago eat-SS=finish-N1.RLS[SG]] ‘he had
finished eating sago’. The semifinite forms in -dV can be followed by the
clitic =k, whose function will be discussed below.
About the function of nonfinite realis forms, Drabbe remarks that:
“They are not participles [Dutch: deelwoorden] in the full sense of the word, but they can
be rendered as such in Dutch, and the fact is that we need a term.” 45The function of nonfinite verb forms is best explained by considering their
distribution, which can be summarized as follows.
1. Nonfinite verb forms never form the final verb of a clause chain or
sentence (for the definition of clause chain and sentence see section
5.1).
2. The subject of the nonfinite verb is coreferential with the subject of
the following verb.4645“het zijn geen deelwoorden in de volle zin van die term, doch ze kunnen in het Ned.door deelwoorden worden weergegeven, en we hebben nu eenmaal een term nodig”
(Drabbe 1957:18a).
46Although this is true in the great majority of cases, the text corpus contains a fewexamples of nonfinite forms followed by a verb with different subject. I noted the
following cases: 1.304, 3.085, 3.157, 6.109, 6.161, 6.284, and 6.302.Some of these cases
could possibly be explained by assuming that we have to do with a verb of perception that
has been left out, for example in 3.085, where I have added the verb in brackets (cf. 3.072,
3.076 and 3.096, where the verb dake is used):Abudadek[dake]a-buda-de=kda-ketake-SScome-SS=CONhear-N1.RLS[SG]50PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: VerbsIn Aghu no difference can be discovered between the functions of -bu
and -dV.47 In this respect, the language seems to have neutralized a prior
distinction that is still found in other Awyu languages, where cognates of -bu are used for future nonfinites, and cognates of -dV for present and
preterite reference as well as for imperatives (Drabbe 1957:18b, referring to
Drabbe 1950). The forms in Aghu can be followed by both realis and
irrealis verb forms, and get a temporal and modal interpretation according
to the specifications of these following verbs (and the context in which
these verbs are used). Drabbe (1957:18) gives the following examples to
illustrate his point. Note that in all cases the subject of a-de and a-bu is
identical to the subject of the following verb xo-xe ‘he went’.
(14)aa-d’xo-xetake-SSgo-N1.RLS[SG]‘he took it with him’ (lit. ‘taking (hold of) it he went’; Drabbe 1957: 18b)
ba-d’axi-n-etake-SSgo_II-N1SG-FUT‘he will take it with him’ (lit. ‘taking (hold of) the things he will go’; Drabbe 1957:18b)efejoxookudeb’ike.efejoxookudeb=i-ke3SGelder.brotherstillDURcall-N1.RLS[SG]‘He brings it and hears that the other brother is still calling.’ (3.085)
While 3.157 can also be explained along the same lines (and possibly 6.109 ‘he sees his
brother cutting the meat’, but I admit this ‘explanation’ is very much ad hoc), this is not
possible for the other cases, although it is remarkable that also in 6.284 and 6.302 we have
to do with a context of perception.
47Drabbe remarks that with imperatives, however, there seems to be a preference for theuse of -dV over bu, as in da-de=k bunu [come-SS=CON sit.IMP[SG] ] ‘come and sit here’
or a-de noxi [take-SS go.IMP[SG] ] ‘take it with you’.","[66, 67, 68]"

In an article comparing Asmat-Kamoro, Awyu-Dumut and Ok languages,
Voorhoeve writes that “all comparative work involving Awyu-Dumut
languages will find itself restricted to an inventory of maximally 500
words.” (Voorhoeve 2005: 164). As can be seen in the wordlist below,
however, I have managed to collect over 800 lexical entries for Aghu, by
unraveling all the data hidden in Drabbe’s publication.
The wordlist below is a compilation of data from three different sources:
the text corpus, examples given by Drabbe in his grammatical introduction
(most of which are cited in this publication) and the thematic wordlist
provided by Drabbe and presented above. Of those three sources, the text
corpus provides the most reliable data, as it presents the words as used in a
more natural context compared to the words in the other sources, which are
all based on word-by word or sentence-by sentence elicitation.
At one point, the orthography in the list differs from elsewhere in this
publication. It is only in this list that words that end in -mV, where V
indicates a harmonzing vowel, are written as such. At other places in this
publication, I have chosen to follow Drabbe’s orthography, and to write theharmonizing vowel according to how it is realized. Thus, kusumV ‘burp’ is
written as kusumu in the English-Aghu wordlist above, as kusum in the
gloss of 2.096 (where the vowel is elided), and as kusumV in the wordlist
below.
For each lemma, we find, in different fonts and in the order as given below:
the part of speech; then an English gloss;352 then one or more references to352Instead of an English gloss, we sometimes found an abbreviation in capitals, used torefer to a grammatical function of the morpheme, e.g. de OPP. While the grammatical388PART II: WORDLISTS. Aghu-English wordlistoccurences in the text corpus, passages in Drabbe or sections in this
