Paragraph,Page number
"The coordination of two units without use of a
coordinator, such as the two clauses in rumahku hancur, sapiku
mati 'my house was destroyed, my cattle were dead ,
partial reduplication This occurs only with bases which begin
with a consonant and involves placing before the base a syllable
consisting of the first consonant of the base followed by e, such as
leluhur 'ancestor', based on luhur 'noble'. This type of
reduplication is no longer productive in the language,
participant One of the semantic relationships involved in an event
and expressed by a noun phrase standing as subject, object, and so
on. Important participants include the actor, which is marked as
subject in an active clause and as agent in a passive clause, and the
patient, which is marked as object in an active clause,
partitive A word which precedes a noun to indicate a particular
amount. Partitives, such as bungkus 'packet' and piring 'plate',
are usually preceded by a number, as in dua bungkus rokok 'two
packets of cigarettes' and sepiring nasi 'a plate of rice',
passive type one A passive clause in which the verb has prefix
di- and the agent is indicated by a phrase following the verb,
sometimes marked by the preposition oleh 'by', such as Surat itu
ditulis oleh Ali 'That letter was written by Ali'. It can only
occur if the agent is third person, except with ter- and ke-,..-an
verbs, in which a passive construction is always passive type one.
passive type two A passive clause in which the verb has no prefix
and the agent precedes the verb, such as Surat itu saya tulis
'That letter was written by me'. The agent phrase must be a
pronoun.
passive voice The form of transitive clause in which the subject
refers to the patient. The actor, if mentioned, is expressed by an
agent phrase. The verb is marked by prefix di- (passive type one) or
has no prefix (passive type two),
patient The participant which is moved or affected by the action (also
called the goal). It occurs as object in most active clauses, such as
Ali in Mereka menolong Ali 'They help Ali'. It occurs as
subject in the passive of such constructions: Ali ditolong oleh
mereka 'Ali is helped by them'. With ditransitive verbs the patient
can occur as the secondary object. Thus, the patient uang 'money'
occurs as secondary object in Saya memberi dia uang 'I give
him money'.
person One of three classes of people involved in what is said; first
person refers to the person speaking, such as saya T, second person
refers to the person being spoken to, such as kamu 'you', and third
person refers to the person or thing being spoken about, such as
mereka 'they' and orang itu 'that person',
personal pronoun A pronoun which refers to a person who has
already been mentioned or is otherwise clear from context, such as
saya T, mereka 'they',
phrase A group of words which is grammatically equivalent to a
single word, being able to occur in the same places as that word.
narataxis1The phrase is built around a head word, which is a member of the
class to which the phrase is equivalent. For instance, a noun phrase
is built around a noun. Prepositional phrases and predicate phrases
have a different structure,
phrase head See head word.
possessive noun A noun which follows another noun to indicate
the possessor. See also possessor,
possessive pronoun A pronoun which follows a noun to indicate
the possessor. See also possessor,
possessor A term which covers a number of semantic relationships
which stand between a noun or pronoun and a preceding noun.
Depending on the context is may mark the owner or possessor
(rumah saya 'my house'), or some other connection, such as
originator or creator (lukisan Monet 'Monet's painting'), or a
family or social relationship (ayah Tomo 'Tomo's father'),
possessor topic-comment clause A topic-comment clause
whose topic corresponds to the possessor in the basic clause from
which it derives. In the following possessor topic-comment clause
the topic is sopir itu, the possessor of nama 'name': Sopir itu,
namanya Ali '(As for) that driver, his name is Ali',
possessor topic-comment relative clause A topic-comment
relative clause whose topic corresponds to the possessor in the basic
clause from which it derives and which means 'whose', as in sopir
yang namanya Ali 'the driver whose name is AH',
predicate The part of a clause which says something about the
subject. The predicate centre contains a word (verb, noun, and so on)
which determines much of the structure of the rest of the clause,
predicate centre The obligatory component of a predicate. The
predicate centre determines the clause type; it is a verb in verbal
clauses and one of a number of phrase types in non-verbal clauses,
such as a noun phrase in a noun clause,
predicate phrase A phrase built around an obligatory predicate
centre, including negative, temporal markers and modals.
prefix An affix which occurs before a base, such as ber- in the word
berjalan 'walk'.
preposition A word which links a following noun phrase to the rest
of a clause, telling what the relationship of that noun phrase is to the
clause. For instance, the preposition di 'in' tells that the following
noun kota is the location, in Mereka tinggal di kota 'They live
in the city'.
prepositional clause A clause whose predicate is a prepositional
phrase, such as untuk ibu 'for mother', in Kalung ini untuk
ibu 'This necklace is for mother',
prepositional phrase A construction consisting of a preposition
followed by a noun phrase, such as untuk orang itu 'for those
people' and dengan teman saya 'with my friend',
prepositional relative clause A relative clause which begins
with a preposition. The noun following the preposition is identical
to the head of the embedding phrase and so is replaced by -nya. Thefollowing example derives from the prepositional phrase d ibelakang rumah 'behind the house': rumah yang di
belakangnya ada pohon mangga 'the house behind which there
is a mango tree'.
primary object The object which immediately follows the verb and
which becomes the subject when the clause is transformed into a
passive. See also secondary object,
primary verb A verb which has primary affixation, that is,
affixation which is not described as replacing some other affixation to
achieve a certain effect. Primary affixation refers to no affix, ber- or
meN- on intransitive verbs, and meN- or di-, alone or in
combination with -kan, -i or per- on transitive verbs. See also
secondary verb,
productive a process (especially use of an affix) which is not
restricted to a limited set of words but can be applied to new words,
pronoun A word which stands for a noun when it is clear who or
what is being spoken about, such as kita 'we', semuanya 'all of
them'.
pronoun substitute A noun which is used for first or second
person and thus acts like a pronoun. Pronoun substitutes are
personal names or kinship terms, such as bapak 'father', translated
'you' if used to refer to the person being addressed and translated T if
referring to the person speaking,
proper noun The specific name of a person, thing, or place, such as
Ali, Hotel Indonesia, Jakarta,
pseudo-intransitive verb A transitive verb which can occur
without its object being expressed, thus resembling an intransitive
verb, such as membaca 'read', in Saya sedang membaca 'I'm
reading'.
quantifier A word or phrase which occurs before a noun to indicate
quantity. It can be a number occurring alone, such as dua 'two', or
in combination with a partitive, such as setengah gelas (air) 'half
a glass of (water)',
quantity clause A clause in which the predicate states the number
or measurement of the subject, such as Anaknya lima 'She has
five children' (literally: 'Her children are five'),
question A construction used when asking for information.
Questions are said to be in interrogative mood,
question word A word occurring in a specific question which
corresponds to one of the 'wh-' words in English, such as siapa
'who', kapan 'when'. Also called an interrogative,
quote noun A noun which consists of a verb base which follows a
direct quote and is itself obligatorily followed by a possessor, such as
kata in ""Selamat pagi"", katanya ""'Good morning"", he said'.
See also quote noun phrase,
quote noun phrase A phrase consisting of a quote noun and a
possessor. The phrase follows a direct quote and corresponds to a
subject and predicate preceding a direct quote. Thus the quote noun
phrase katanya 'he said' in ""Selamat pagi"", katanya '""Goodmorning"", he said', corresponds to dia berkata 'he said' in Dia
berkata, ""Selamat pagi 'He said, ""Good morning""',
recipient The person at whom an action is directed. It usually
follows prepositions kepada and pada 'to'. With some verbs,
especially -i verbs, it can occur as object, such as dia 'he' in Saya
memberi dia uang 'I give him money',
reciprocal verb A verb which indicates that two people do the
same thing to each other or that two people or things stand in the
same relation to each other. Corresponding verbs in English usually
have 'each other' as object, as in Mereka pukul-memukul They
hit each other'.
reduplication The doubling of a word (see full reduplication) or
the addition of a syllable before the word (see partial
reduplication).
referent phrase The component of an adjective phrase which
indicates with reference to whom or what the characteristic indicated
by the adjective applies. It is introduced by a preposition such as
untuk 'for', as in terlalu besar untuk saya 'too big for me',
reflexive The word sendiri 'self, which occurs with nouns and
pronouns to emphasise or make clear who or what is being referred
to. See also reflexive phrase,
reflexive phrase A phrase which usually occurs as the object of a
verb to indicates that the object refers to the same person as the
subject. The full phrase is diri + pronoun + sendiri, as in Dia
mencandai dirinya sendiri 'He jokes at himself. See also
reflexive pronoun,
reflexive pronoun The word diri 'self, which can occur alone, as
in menjaga diri 'look after oneself, or in a reflexive phrase,
relative clause A clause preceded by yang and occurring in a noun
phrase to give information about the noun. The term usually refers
to a defining relative clause, as in orang yang duduk di situ 'the
person who is sitting there',
second person See person.
secondary object A noun which indicates the patient and which
follows the primary object of a ditransitive verb, such as uang
'money' in Dia memberi mereka uang 'He gave them money',
secondary verb A verb which has secondary affixation, which
replaces primary affixation under certain circumstances. Thus
terbakar 'burned' is a secondary verb, whose affix ter- replaces
primary affix di- to indicate accidental action. See also primary
verb.
semantic role See participant.
sentence A construction which can stand alone as a complete
utterance. A sentence can be a statement, question, command or
exclamation.
sentence adjunct An adjunct which is not part of a clause but is
used with a clause or series of clauses to convey the speaker's
comment on what is being said, such as rupanya 'apparently',
sayang 'unfortunately'. Also called sentence adverbial or disjunct.
Msentence adverbial See sentence adjunct,
sentence linker A word similar to a conjunction but which insteadof linking one clause to another within a sentence links two
sentences, at the same time indicating the kind of connection there is
between the two sentences, such as oleh karena itu 'therefore ,
meskipun demikian 'despite that, nevertheless',
sentence tag A word attached to the end of a question for such
purposes as seeking confirmation, such as bukan in Saudara
mahasiswa, bukan? 'You are a student, aren't you?'
simple intransitive verb An intransitive verb which has no
affixation, such as tidur 'sleep', duduk 'sit*,
simple nominal clause An active verbal clause used as a noun,
meaning 'the general activity denoted by the verb'. It can have an
object but no subject and usually occurs as the subject of a clause,
such as mencari pekerjaan 'looking for work' in Mencari
pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah 'Finding work in the
city is not very easy',
simple sentence A sentence which consists of a single independent
clause.
simple transitive verb A transitive verb which consists only of a
base and one of the inflectional affixes meN- ordi-, such as

specific question A question which requires specific information as
an answer and which cannot be answered by 'yes' or 'no'. It contains
a question word, such as siapa 'who', di mana 'where'. See also
yes-no question,
statement An utterance used when we give information, express an
opinion, and so on. Statements are sometimes said to be in the
declarative mood.
stative verb A verb with prefix ter- which refers to a state rather
than an action and which thus has no actor, such as terletak
'located'.
subject The component of a clause which is the thing being
discussed, the 'theme' of the utterance. It is frequently something
which has been mentioned previously, about which something new
(the predicate) is said, as Ali in Ali sudah pulang 'Ali has gone
home'.
subordinate clause A clause which cannot stand alone as a
sentence but which occurs with another clause (the main clause) in a
complex sentence. It can occur either before or after the main clause
to add information to it. The subordinate clause is preceded by a
subordinating conjunction, such as sesudah 'after', in Mereka

1INTRODUCTIONThis is a description of the Indonesian language for Englishspeaking teachers and learners and for any others interested
in the language and its structures.
The work recognises that the majority of such people will not
be familiar with linguistic concepts and terminology.
Consequently it avoids linguistic jargon and theoretical
discussion. It also differs from linguistic studies in that it
does not always describe Indonesian grammar 'in its own
right'. The special needs of English learners of the language
are taken into account, with more detailed discussion of
structures which differ significantly from corresponding
structures in English. English and Indonesian structures are
specifically contrasted if the Indonesian structure is one which
causes particular difficulty for English-speaking learners.
The variety of Indonesian described here can be called
standard formal Indonesian. This can loosely be identified as
the language of government, administration and the mass
media in the Republic of Indonesia. It is the type of
Indonesian in which education takes place and which is used
by educated people in formal situations, whether written or
spoken. There is very little mention here of forms
characteristic only of colloquial and non-standard varieties of
Indonesian. Such varieties of the language vary considerablyfrom region to region, social group to social group and
according to the degree of informality of the situation.
Attempting to deal with what are in fact different grammatical
systems together in a single description would result in a
confusing hotchpotch and would divert attention from the
basic aim of this work, which is to provide a description of the
formal standard language. In some cases colloquial forms are
mentioned if they are widely used. However, this is rarely
done and phenomena such as the dropping of certain verbal
affixes in everyday speech are not discussed.
Even within formal standard Indonesian there is a
considerable amount of variation compared with that found in
standard English. Where there are alternative structures only
one might be acceptable to some educated people. Mention
of such differences is sometimes made. If published sources
give conflicting opinions as to the grammaticality of a
structure this is sometimes mentioned in a footnote. Much
variation, however, must go uncommented upon, including
the tendency of certain structures to be favoured by people of
particular regional language backgrounds.
Only rarely is comment made on the frequency of occurrence
of forms or on their level of formality (although forms
occurring mainly in colloquial styles are specifically
identified as such). Differences in usage between people of
different social and ethnic groups makes this a complex topic
in the study of the Indonesian language and comments are
necessarily very general.
Further, Indonesian is a language in a state of rapid change.
New words suddenly appear, some to acquire permanent
acceptance, others to quickly disappear. The mass media,
frequently translating from English, are constantly
introducing English words and structures. With the enormous
influence of the press on the language, structures regarded as
un-Indonesian or ungrammatical quite recently have become
acceptable (at least to some people) today. The Javanese
language too continues to influence Indonesian, both in
lexicon and syntax. The changes that have been occurring in
Indonesian present difficulties for any attempt to describe thelanguage. A grammar is basically a synchronic statement and
little attempt is made here to capture diachronic change,
although some important current trends are noted. Structures
which were common in earlier language may not be
mentioned here if they were not recorded in modern usage
during the preparation of this description.
In order to provide a practical reference for most user needs a
grammar must aim for a certain degree of completeness. The
present grammar describes in some detail all the major
structures of Indonesian from words to complex sentences.
However, it stops far short of attempting to describe the
various functions of individual words, this being the task of
dictionaries and studies of word usage (such as Sarumpaet
1980). While contrasts between function words are frequently
pointed out, this is necessarily brief; Kaswanti Purwo's attempt
to investigate the differences in function between various
deictic words (Kaswanti Purwo 1984) reveals what an
enormous task this would be if extended to the entire lexicon.
In the production of this work I have drawn on many sources
for information on the language, exploiting the study and
insights of numerous people. All published works from
which information on Indonesian grammar have been taken
are given in the list of references. While major structures are
dealt with in some detail, as mentioned above, the description
is hampered by the fact that many areas of Indonesian
grammar have not been subjected to detailed analysis. Gaps
in our knowledge are found in all areas of the grammar, with
a great deal of analysis still being required on the affixes terand ke-...-an, on reciprocal constructions, and on
complementation, to name but a very few areas. This
grammar then is only as complete as research on any area
allows.
An attempt is made to provide a reasonable number of varied
examples in natural contexts for all structures discussed.
Examples of constructions are drawn from numerous sources,
including newspapers, magazines and novels, television and
radio, and, to a lesser extent, from conversation. Others are
directly elicited from speakers of Indonesian. Where anumber of words function in the same way a list of examples
is usually provided. English glosses to words in such lists are
meant as a guide only. A gloss does not attempt to capture
the complexities of a word's meaning and refers only to its
meaning in the particular construction being discussed.
Where dictionaries disagree as the the meaning of a word, a
not uncommon occurrence, the tendency here is to follow
Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (1991). Echols and Shadily's
dictionary (in the 1989 revision edited by John Wolff and
James Collins) has also been influential.
The work is in four chapters, each based on one of the four
basic levels of Indonesian grammar discussed: Words, Phrases,
Clauses, Sentences. No chapter is strictly confined to
describing elements at the level referred to in its title. In
particular, in dealing with the function of certain affixes, a
satisfactory description must take into account the syntactic
structures within which words taking those affixes occur. This
is especially true in the coverage of verbal affixes.
Because many structures must be referred to in several
sections cross-referencing is extensive. This attempts to help
the reader find desired information as quickly as possible,
something often very difficult in reference grammars. This is
also aided by a table of contents at the beginning of the work
and a more detailed index at the end.
Sections are numbered consecutively from the beginning to
the end of each chapter. As far as possible, each section has
been designed to be informative if read alone, thus providing
the reader with useful information on a particular small aspect
of the language.
A grammar is essentially a set of generalisations about a
language, each structure described being a general description
of a large number of utterances of a particular form. In order
for structures to be conveniently discussed labels must be
applied to them. These labels are called grammatical terms.
Grammatical terms used in this work are defined in the
section dealing with the structure they label. A glossary of
common terms is also provided. Terms used are basically thecommon terms of traditional grammar, although some areused here in a somewhat different way from what is usual ingrammars of English. Moreover, a few terms have been
coined here specifically to meet the needs of Indonesian
grammar. However, an effort is made to keep the the numberof grammar terms to a minimum.","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]"

"Copulas occur most commonly in noun clauses and some
Indonesians regard them as unacceptable in any other clause
types. However, they are readily used by other speakers in
some other non-verbal clauses, especially in adjective clauses.
Copulas mark the division between subject and predicate.
They are not obligatory and are least likely to occur in short
constructions such as Ayah guru 'Father is a teacher'.
They are most common in noun clauses where either the
subject or predicate is long, in which case they break up a
string of nouns and add a smoothness to the construction:Ayah Tomo adalah pegawai Bank Indonesia.
Tomo's father is an employee of the Bank of Indonesia.
Kain kebaya ialah pakaian wanita Jawa.
The kain kebaya is the clothing of Javanese women.
Copulas are also frequently used if the predicate is a
nominalised verb, bahwa clause or untuk clause (see 3.6 for
examples).
The following examples illustrate copulas in adjective and
prepositional clauses:
Setiap calon pembeli adalah penting.
Each prospective purchaser is important.
Satu-satunya air yang ada adalah dari telaga.
The only water there is is from the lake.
Although they can occur with locative predicates, the copulas
do not occur before preposition di. Instead ada occurs (see
3.58).
The copulas adalah and ialah are not verbs; they precede the
entire predicate including a negative. The combination of a
copula and negative is, however, rare:
Bahasa Indonesia adalah bukan bahasa yang penampil
subyek.
Indonesian is not a subject-prominent language.
Pernyataan ketua koperasi itu adalah tidak benar.
The statement by the chairman of the cooperative is not
correct.
Several other words are sometimes referred to as copulas
because they serve to link two noun phrases. However, these
words, including merupakan 'be, constitute' and menjadi 'be,
become', are full verbs and can be negated.
Subjectless clauses3.15 Some clauses describe states or events for which
there is no subject. They correspond to English constructions
which have 'impersonal it' as subject (which is sometimes
called a 'dummy subject' because it does not actually refer toor identify anything; it simply occurs because English clause
structure demands the presence of a subject).
Such clauses frequently refer to natural states:
Hujan sekarang.
It's raining now.
Dingin sekali.
It's very cold.
Sepi di sini.
It's quiet here.
Some people use words such as hari 'day' or hawa 'weather'
as a subject in some of these constructions:
Hari hujan.
It's raining.
Hawa panas.
The weather's hot.
Subjectless clauses can also refer to time:
Sudah jam tujuh.
It's already seven o'clock.
Verbal clauses3.16 Verbal clauses have a verb as their predicate centre.
Verbal clauses display greater variety and complexity than
non-verbal constructions; special consideration is required for
transitivity (see 3.18-25), voice (see 3.26-40) and word order
(3.41-9). The verb ada has some unique characteristics and
is discussed separately in sections 3.54-60.
Further, a consideration of grammatical roles and semantic
roles is important for an understanding of verbal clauses.
This topic is mentioned in section 3.17.
Participant roles3.17 Components of the clause such as subject and object
refer to grammatical relationships. However, the semantic
relationship between these elements and the predicate can
vary. For instance, in the clause Ali memukul John 'Ali hits
John', the subject Ali refers to the participant who carries outthe action. In the clause Ali dipukul John 'Ali is hit by John ,
the subject identifies the participant to which something is
done, the patient.
1The major participants, or semantic roles, are:
Actor : The one who carries out the action. The actor is
expressed by the subject in an active clause, such as Ali in
Ali menolong saya 'Ali helps me'. It occurs as agent in a
passive clause, which is optionally marked by oleh 'by' (see
3.27): Saya ditolong (oleh) Ali 'I am helped by Ali'.
Patient : The patient, also called the goal, is the participant
which is moved or affected by the action. It occurs as
object in most active clauses, such as Ali in Mereka
menolong Ali 'They help Ali'. It occurs as subject in the
passive of such constructions: Ali ditolong oleh mereka
'Ali is helped by them'. With ditransitive verbs the patient
can occur as the secondary object (see 3.20). Thus, the
patient uang 'money' occurs as secondary object in Saya
memberi dia uang 'I give him money'.
Recipient : This is the person at whom the action is directed.
It can follow prepositions kepada and pada 'to'. With
some verbs, especially -i verbs (see 1.212), it can occur as
object, such as dia 'he' in Saya memberi dia uang 'I give
him money'. In passives of such constructions it occurs as
subject: Dia diberi uang 'He is given money'.
Location : This is the place where the action occurs or the
place from which or to which the action is directed. It is
normally marked by a prepositional phrase. However, it
can be the object with -i verbs and some simple transitive
verbs, such as kebun 'garden' in Mereka menanami kebun
- 'They plant the garden'. In passives of such constructions
it occurs as subject: Kebun ditanami The garden is
planted'.
Beneficiary : This is the person for whose benefit an action
is performed. It is usually marked by preposition untuk
'for'. With benefactive -kan verbs (see 1.206) it occurs as
object, such as Ali in Saya membelikan Ali buku 'I buyAli a book'. In passives of such constructions it occurs as
subject: Ali dibelikan buku 'Ali is bought a book'.
Instrument : This is the thing with which the action is
performed. It is usually marked by preposition dengan
'with', such as tali 'rope' in Dia mengikat anjing dengan
tali 'He tied up the dog with a rope'. This participant can
sometimes occur as object, that is with 'instrumental' -kan
(see 1.205). However, it is probably best to recognise a
reinterpretation of the role of the participant in this case.
That is, in the construction Dia mengikatkan tali ke anjing
'He tied the rope to the dog', tali is best considered as
having the role of patient.
Transitive and intransitive3.18 If an action or event involves only one participant it
is expressed by an intransitive clause. An intransitive clause
has two nuclear components, a subject, which indicates the
actor, and a predicate, which contains an intransitive verb (see
lA66ff):Mereka bekerja.
They are working.
Siti menangis.
Siti is crying.","[265, 266, 267, 268, 269]"
"Third person pronouns dia and ia2.70 Third person singular ia and dia both mean 'he, she .
Dia can occur in all positions. However, ia is restricted in
occurrence to pre-verbal position. That is, it can be used
instead of dia when it occurs before a verb, either as subject,
in either an active or passive sentence, or as agent in a type
two passive (see 3.28). In all other positions, including object
or agent following a verb, following a preposition, as
predicate and as a possessive, only dia can occur (although
-nya can occur instead in some of these positions - see 2.71):
Dia/ia akan menolong kami.
He will help us.
makanan yang sudah dia/ia pesan
the food he has ordered
makanan yang sudah dipesan (oleh) dia
the food which he has ordered
Kami akan menolong dia.
We will help her.
Berikan buku ini kepada dia.
Give this book to her.
Ini buku dia.
This is her book.
Itu bukan dia.
That isn't him.
1The rule that ia cannot occur after the verb does not apply in
cases where as subject it follows the verb as a result of change
from standard word order (see 3.42):
Melihat raksasa itu datang, bersembunyilah ia ke balik
batu besar.
Seeing the giant coming, he hid behind a large rock.
(Standard word order: Ia bersembunyi...)
Harus pergikah ia?
- Must she go? (Standard word order: Ia harus pergi?)
Also ia can occur as object of the verb if it is also the subject
of a complement (see 3.76); in this case its role as subject of
the following complement takes precedence over its role as
object of the preceding verb. Dia and -nya can occur instead
of ia:Saya menganggapnya/dia/ia bodoh.
I consider him stupid.
Sikap inilah yang menyebabkan ia dijuluki ""nyinyir"".
It was this trait which caused him to be nicknamed
""nagger"".
In older Malay dia was an inflected form of ia, occurring in
those positions in which only dia can occur in modern
Indonesian. First and second person equivalents daku T and
dikau 'you might still occasionally be seen in older literature
but are lost from the modern language:
Suaranya yang merdu membenamkan daku ke satu
fantasi yang indah dan ajaib.
Her melodious voice enveloped me in a beautiful and
mysterious fantasy.
1Bound forms of pronouns2.71 The singular pronouns aku, engkau and kamu, and
dia have bound variants in certain situations. The bound
forms are:
suffixed
prefixed
-ku
kufirst
-mu
kausecond
-nya
third
The suffixed forms occur as objects of active verbs:
Narti menungguku/mu/nya.
Narti is waiting for me/you/him.
The suffixed forms can only occur if the verb has prefix
meN-; hence they cannot occur with those transitive verbs
such as makan 'eat which do not have the prefix (see 1.186).
In this case full pronouns aku, kamu and dia must be used or,
if a non-human is referred to, either the noun must be
repeated or ellipsis (see 4.113) occurs. The first sentence
below contains unprefixed makan 'eat\ while the second
contains the same verb with prefix meN-:
Dia mengambil kue itu lalu makan.
He took the cake and ate [it].
Dia mengambil kue itu lalu memakannya.
He took the cake and ate it.
1Suffixed forms also cannot occur where meN- is dropped in
colloquial usage or in certain constructions such as
imperatives (see 4.39). Nor can they occur as complements.
Thus -nya can occur as object of mempelajari 'study':
mempelajarinya 'study it', but not as complement of belajar
'study' (see 3.63).
The third person suffixed form occurs as agent of a passhe
verb in passive type one (see 3.27):
Narti ditunggunya.
He is waiting for Narti.
The prefixed forms occur as agents of passive verbs in passive
type two (see 3.28). There is no third person form:
Buku ini sudah kubaca.
I have read this book.
Buku ini sudah kaubaca.
You have read this book.
Bound forms can occur as possessives:
rumahku my house
mobilmu your car
bukunya her book
They also follow some prepositions. Most prepositions (see
2.118ff) can only be followed by full forms of the pronouns:
seperti aku 'like me', tentang kamu 'about you', kecuali dia
'except him', dari dia 'from her'. Some, like kepada 'to', allow
bound pronouns to follow: kepadaku 'to me', kepadamu 'to
you', kepadanya 'to him'. Other prepositions allowing
suffixed pronouns include: pada 'at, to', daripada 'than;
from', bagi 'for', buat 'for', untuk 'for', bersama 'together
with', dengan 'with', terhadap 'towards', oleh 'by', dari 'than'.
In all situations in which the bound forms can occur
corresponding free forms are also possible:
Buku ini sudah aku/engkau baca.
I/you have read this book.
Ini pena aku/kamu/dia.
This is my/your/his pen.
Narti menunggu aku/kamu/dia.","[191, 192, 193, 194]"
"1.39 There are two types of affix according to function:
derivational and inflectional. When a derivational affix is
attached to a base it changes the word to another class; that is,
it derives another class. An inflectional affix does not change
the category of the word. Most affixes in Indonesian are
derivational. The important inflectional affixes are the voice
affixes meN- and di-, which are attached to transitive verbs to
signal whether they are active or passive.
1.40 Affixes can occur in combination. Thus the word
memperbesar 'enlarge' contains base besar 'large with
prefixes meN- and per-.
1A circumfix must be distinguished from a combination of
prefix and suffix. Thus berpakaian 'clothed, wearing clothes'
consists of prefix ber- 'have, wear' and base pakaian 'clothes'.
This in turn consists of base pakai 'wear' and'suffix -an. On
the other hand, berdatangan 'come in random fashion'
consists of circumfix ber-...-an 'do in random manner' and
base datang 'come'.
1.41 Most of the affixes described in the remainder of
this chapter are indigenous, while a few are borrowings from
other languages. A number of other affixes now occurring in
the language are not discussed here, such as -isme, as in
kolonialisme 'colonialism', and -itas, as in stabilitas 'stability'.
These are generally recent acquisitions from European
languages, attached to bases which are also borrowed from
European languages. While some are common in the speech
of educated people, they are not regarded as sufficiently
assimilated for inclusion here. However, commonly
occurring affixes borrowed from Sanskrit and Arabic are
included.
1.42 In a number of words borrowed from Sanskrit male
and female forms are distinguished, the former ending in a
and the latter in i. The distinction has been extended to a few
native words. The form with a is sometimes general, applying
both to males and females, while the form with i is alwaysfeminine. This ending is not a suffix as the word cannot
occur without it:
dewa god, deity : dewi goddess
pemuda youth : pemudi young female
pramugara air steward : pramugari air stewardess
putra son; prince : putri daughter; princess
saudara relative of same generation; you : saudari you
(to female)
The only affixes which make a gender distinction are -wan
and -wati (see 1.105).
1.43 In the following discussion affixes are grouped
according to the class of word they derive. The 'parts of
speech' referred to, noun, verb and so on, are described in
Chapter Two. When discussing the meaning of affixes it is
sometimes convenient to use the symbol [base] to indicate
that the meaning of any relevant base can occur in that
position. Thus, in section 1.59 the meaning of -an is
described as apa yang di-[base]. With the base makan this
becomes apa yang dimakan.
Derivation of nouns1.44 A considerable number of affixes can be attached to
bases to derive nouns. Nouns are further discussed in section
2.3.
Prefix peN-1.45 This prefix is attached to verbs and some other
words to derive nouns with several closely related meanings.
With some bases peN- alternates with pe-, as discussed in
section 1.53.
1.46 PeN- is attached to verbal bases to derive nouns
indicating a person who carries out the action expressed by
the base. Corresponding verbs are given for comparison in
the following examples:
menganut follow : penganut follower, adherent
menonton view : penonton spectator
menulis write : penulis writermenumpang ride in : penumpang passenger
menduduki occupy : penduduk inhabitant
1.47 peN- also derives nouns referring to inanimate
objects, usually the instrument with which the action is
performed. Such forms frequently modify another noun (see
2.37) or are themselves modified by another noun, as shown
in the following examples:
membangkitkan generate : pembangkit (listrik)
(electricity) generator
mempersatukan unify : pemersatu unifier
mencetak print : (mesin) pencetak printer
menenangkan calm : (obat) penenang sedative
mengendalikan control : (menara) pengendali control
(tower)
menggaris draw a line : penggaris ruler
menutup shut : penutup (botol) (bottle) top
merangsang stimulate : perangsang stimulant
1.48 A peN- noun can sometimes mean either a person
who performs the action or an instrument with which the
action is performed, depending on context:
mencetak print : pencetak printer (person or instrument)
mendengarkan listen : pendengar listener; (alat)
pendengar hearing aid
menjebak trap, snare : penjebak trapper; trap
1.49 A few peN- nouns are based not on verbs but on
other parts of speech, usually adjectives. These refer to
someone or something associated with the base:
besar big : pembesar important person
jahat bad : penjahat criminal
mabuk intoxicated : pemabuk drunk (person)
muda young : pemuda youth
sakit sick : penyakit illness
sebab cause : penyebab cause
A number of other forms based on adjectives, such as pemalu
'shy person , are often interpreted as nouns but bear more
resemblance to adjectives. These are described in sections
1.119-22.
1prefix pe-1.50 This prefix derives nouns indicating a person who
carries out an action. It occurs with a limited number of
bases.
1.51 Pe- derives nouns indicating a person who carries
out the action indicated by the corresponding ber- verb. It
only occurs with bases which begin with a consonant:
bekerja work : pekerja worker
berdagang trade : pedagang trader, merchant
berjalan walk : pejalan (kaki) pedestrian
berziarah go on pilgrimage : peziarah pilgrim
1.52 Pe- nouns sometimes refer to sporting activities.
Some of these have no corresponding ber- verbs:
berenang swim : perenang swimmer
bergulat wrestle : pegulat wrestler
bertinju box : petinju boxer
bulu tangkis badminton : pebulu tangkis badminton
player
tenis tennis : petenis tennis player
1.53 In a few cases both peN- and pe- nouns occur with
the same base, having the same or very similar meanings:
bersaing, menyaingi compete : pesaing, penyaing
competitor
bersulap, menyulap conjure : pesulap, penyulap
conjurer
cinta, mencintai love : pecinta, pencinta lover
1.54 PeN- and pe- may both occur but with different
meaning. Sometimes peN- indicates one who performs the
action (the actor), being related to a verb with prefix meN-,
while pe- indicates one who undergoes the action (the patient
- see 3.17), being related to a verb with prefix di-:
penatar trainer (menatar run upgrading course) :
petatar trainee (ditatar be upgraded, trained)
penunjuk indicator (menunjukkan indicate) : petunjuk
instructions, indication (ditunjukkan indicated)penyuruh one who gives orders (menyuruh order) :
pesuruh messenger, one who takes orders (disuruh
ordered)
In a few cases both forms occur with different meanings
which are not related to actor and patient:
penjabat (menteri) acting (minister) : pejabat official
(menjabat hold office)
penyerta companion (menyertai accompany) : peserta
participant (ikut serta participate)
1.55 With some bases N is lost from peN- (see 1.5). With
such bases the prefix can only be determined by the
corresponding verb. Thus pelukis 'painter' has prefix peN-,
corresponding to melukis 'paint', while pelari 'runner' has
prefix pe-, relating to berlari 'run'. The prefix in pelatih
'trainer, coach' is peN- as the word relates to melatih 'train
(someone)', not to berlatih 'train, practice'.
Prefix per-1.56 There are a very few nouns with prefix per-. Several
of these have bases with an initial vowel and these could be
regarded as having a variant of prefix pe-:
pelajar student (belajar study)
perantara intermediary, go-between (berantara be
spaced)
pe(r)tanda sign, indication
pertapa hermit, ascetic (bertapa live as an ascetic)
In several cases there is contrast with peN-, thus pelajar
'student' and pengajar 'instructor, teacher' (mengajar teach).
Suffix -an1:57 Suffix -an derives nouns from verbs and, to a lesser
extent, from nouns, adjectives and other classes. It also cooccurs with full and partial reduplication. It has a number of
different functions.
1.58 Suffix -an most commonly attaches to verb bases,
several different meanings being distinguishable.","[53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"
"AU partitives indicating containers (see 2.28) also occur as
full nouns:
Botol ini retak*
This bottle is cracked.
2.33 Group numbers and some partitives, including those
indicating containers (see 2.28), and measurement nouns (see
2.30), can be reduplicated and prefixed with ber- to indicate
an indefinite quantity (see also 1.161 and 1.162 for further
examples):
berjuta-juta orang millions of people
berliter-liter susu litres and litres of milk
berbotol-botol bir bottles and bottles of beer
bermacam-macam tanaman all sorts of plants
Diminutives and honorifics2.34 These occur immediately before the head noun to
convey an attitude on the part of the speaker, usually of
affection or respect.
Si2.35 This is a diminutive. It is used with the names of
children, emphasising their smallness or a feeling of affection
on the part of the speaker:
si Ali Ali (a child)
Si can also be used with the names of animals, especially pets
or animals in folk stories. In this case it is a personifier as
well as diminutive:
si Putih Whitey (name of an pet)
si Kancil Mousedeer (character in folk stories)
It can occur with adjectives, usually those indicating physical
characteristics, turning the adjective into a proper noun while
still acting as a diminutive:
si Botak Baldy
si Gemuk Fatty
si Tolol Dopey
The nominalised adjective may become a common noun, in
which case the diminutive sense is usually absent:Pembagian pangan yang tak merata membuat si gendut
makin kaya, tanpa peduli nasib si miskin, yang hampir
mati kelaparan.
Unequal distribution of food makes the fat one
increasingly rich, without caring about the fate of the poor
one, who almost dies of hunger.
It also occurs with common nouns, most frequently those
formed with peN- (see 1.46). Here there is no diminutive
connotation:
si pembawa resep
the one who brought the prescription
Si pengirim foto tidak menyebutkan namanya.
The sender of the photos didn't mention his name.
Sang2.36 This is an honorific. It shows that the person
referred to is someone held in high respect:
sang Raja the King
sang Presiden the President
Like si, it can occur with names of animals in folk tales. It
also occurs before the name of the Indonesian flag, thus
acting as a personifier as well as retaining its role as an
honorific:
sang Harimau Tiger
sang Merah Putih the Red and White (the Indonesian flag)
It can also be used facetiously or even sarcastically to indicate
the speaker's negative attitude towards someone who is
perhaps more highly regarded than he deserves:
Sekitar tiga puluh tahun silam nama John Profumo
melambung di media massa karena sang menteri terlibat
skandal seks dengan seorang pelacur.
About thirty years ago the name of John Profumo was
prominent in the media because the esteemed minister was
involved in a sex scandal with a prostitute.
Modifying nouns2.37 A noun can be followed by another noun called a
modifying noun. A modifying noun gives more specificinformation about the head noun. There is a wide range of
relationships between the two nouns. The modifying noun
can indicate what the head noun is made of, where it comes
from, what it is used for, what it does, where it is, what it is part
of, what sex it is, what process it has undergone, and so on.
The following examples illustrate a number of these
relationships:
toko buku book shop
guru bahasa language teacher
sate ayam chicken sate
buku sejarah history book
pemain tenis tennis player
ilmu kedokteran medical science
mesin pendingin cooling machine
tukang kayu carpenter (wood artisan)
buku catatan note book
anak perempuan girl (female child)
orang Jepang Japanese (person)
kapal Indonesia Indonesian ship
kain batik batik cloth
pinggir jalan edge of the road
Some modifying relationships occur only with action nouns;
these are discussed in section 2.53.
2.38 No other word can come between a head word and
following modifying nou:i. Any word following the
modifying noun refers to the head word and not to the
modifying noun:
toko buku yang besar a big book shop
guru sekolah itu that school teacher
An exception is that some modifying nouns can themselves
take a modifier. In the first example below the head of the
noun phrase is awak 'crew . The modifying noun bis 'bus'
has its own modifying noun, kota 'city':
awak bis kota city bus crew
buku sejarah Indonesia Indonesian history book
gelombang keresahan sosial a wave of social unrest
12.39 In some cases the modifying noun must itself be
modified, that is, the phrase would be incomplete if consistingjust of the head word and modifier. In such cases the
modifier is a peN- noun based on a transitive verb (see 1.46)
and its own modifier relates to the object of the
corresponding verb. The first example below relates to
Pasukan itu memelihara perdamaian 'Those troops keep the
peace ; pasukan pemelihara is not well-formed unless
pemelihara 'keeper, maintained has the modifier perdamaian
'peace . The modifier and its own modifier act as a
compound and are hyphenated in English equivalents:
pasukan pemelihara perdamaian peace-keeping forces
propinsi penghasil lada pepper-producing province
kapal pembawa plutonium plutonium-carrying ship
kunjungan pencari fakta fact-finding visit
11Possessors2.40 A possessor follows the head word. It can be a noun
or a pronoun:
rumah Tomo Tomo's house
nama negeri itu the name of that country
mobil saya my car
Possessive pronouns are further discussed in section 2.72.
Possessive nouns differ from modifying nouns (see 2.37ff) in
that they can themselves be the head of a noun phrase. In the
following example the possessor, toko 'shop', is head of a
noun phrase which contains a modifier and demonstrative:
nama toko buku itu the name of that book shop
As head of a noun phrase a possessive noun can also take a
possessor:
kantor ayah saya my father's office
mobil teman Marni Marni's friend's car
Out of context ambiguity may exist as to whether a noun is
modifying or possessive. Thus bis 'bus' is a modifier in the
first example below, describing what kind of driver Ali is, but
possessor in the second:
Ali sopir bis.
Ali is a bus driver.
Sopir bis ini belum muncul.
The driver of this bus hasn't turned up yet.","[168, 169, 170, 171, 172]"
"Suffix -kan with two functions1.208 If a transitive verb can occur without a suffix the
possibility exists for it to add -kan to indicate that someone
else is caused to do the action (see 1.19Iff) or to mark the
object as instrument (see 1.205) or beneficiary (see 1.206).
Thus menjahit 'sew allows the addition of -kan to show that
the subject gets someone else to perform the action or that the
subject performs the action for someone else's benefit:
Saya menjahitkan kemeja ke tukang jahit.
I had my shirt sewn by that tailor.
Tukang jahit itu menjahitkan saya kemeja baru.
That tailor sewed me a new shirt.
1Other verbs which allow the addition of -kan with these two
functions include:
mencuci wash
menimbang weigh
memeriksa inspect, check
memikul bear, carry on the shoulder
The verb menulis 'write' allows -kan with both instrumental
and benefactive meanings:
Dia menuliskan pensil tumpul.
He wrote with a blunt pen.
Dia menuliskan ayahnya surat.
He wrote a letter for his father.
Other verbs which allow -kan with these two functions
include:
membelikan buy with (money); buy for (someone)
memotongkan chop with (something); chop for
(someone)
membalutkan wrap with (something); wrap for (someone)
Other functions of rkan1.209 Sometimes meanings occur in addition to those
noted above. Thus, in addition to meaning 'read for
someone', membacakan can mean 'read aloud, recite':
membacakan puisi 'recite poetry'. As well as meaning 'carry
for someone' membawakan can mean 'convey, present,
perform : membawakan lagu 'present a song'. As well as the
1two meanings given above, menuliskan can mean 'write
down': menuliskan pikiran 'write down (one's) thoughts'.
Some other simple transitive verbs which can add -kan to
form a verb whose meaning cannot be put into any of the
above categories include:
melukis paint : melukiskan describe
mendapat get : mendapatkan discover, obtain
mendengar hear : mendengarkan listen to
menunjuk point to : menunjukkan indicate
Optional-kan1.210 With a number of words -kan can be omitted without
change of meaning. Most, though not all, such verbs are in
the group in 1.190 above. Thus, both mengantar and
mengantarkan mean 'accompany':
Utomo mengantar/mengantarkan ibunya ke pasar.
Utomo accompanied his mother to the market.
In the following examples optional -kan is indicated in
parentheses:
melempar(kan) throw mengirim(kan) send
menanam(kan) plant
merusak(kan) damage
menuang(kan) pour
menyebut(kan) mention
memberi(kan) give
menitip(kan) entrust
menyumbang(kan) contribute
mengantar(kan) accompany
In a few cases the optionality of -kan is different in active and
passive voice. This is discussed in section 3.35.
Transitive verbs with suffix -i1.211 Suffix -i has two major functions: to indicate that the
object is the location of the action and to indicate repeated
action. When suffix -i occurs with a base ending in i the
sounds merge into one: beri + -i —> beri.
Locative -/1.212 The most common function of -i is to indicate that
the object is the place where the action occurs or the person
or place to which the action is directed. When the action is
directed at a person that participant is called the recipient;when it is located at or directed at a place that participant is
the location. Both these participants are referred to as
location if there is no need to distinguish them. These
participant roles are further discussed in section 3.17.
1.213 Many -i locative verbs have noun bases. The largest
group of these mean 'apply or give [base] to the object'.
Thus, in the examples below menandatangani 'sign' means
that the base tandatangan 'signature' is applied to the object
surat 'letter' and menghormati 'honour' means that the base
hormat 'honour' is applied to the object orang tua 'parents':
Dia menandatangani surat.
She signed the letter.
Kita harus menghormati orang tua kita.
We must honour/respect our parents.
Other verbs with noun bases and suffix -i with this function
include:
mengilhami inspire
mewawancarai interview
melukai wound
menangani tackle, handle
meracuni poison
mengampuni forgive
meminyaki oil
mempengaruhi influence
mengakhiri end
mengipasi fan
membatasi limit
menggarami salt
membanjiri flood
meludahi spit on
menasihati advise
menamai name
memagari fence
mewarnai colour
merestui bless
membohongi lie to
mengisi fill
menilai evaluate
menghargai appreciate, respect
mengobati apply medicine to, treat
In a few cases the verb means that what is expressed by the
base is removed from the object rather than applied to it.
This is also generally the case with English equivalents of
such verbs:
menyisiki scale (fish)
menguliti skin, peel
mengutui delouse, remove lice
menulangi remove bones
membului pluck, remove feathersmerumputi weed, remove weeds
In both English and Indonesian removal, rather than addition,
is meant when removal is the action typically applied to the
object. However, in specific contexts addition may be
indicated by the same verbs. Thus, in the expression
menguliti buku 'cover a book', the verb menguliti indicates
the addition of something rather than the removal of
something, as does membului in membului anak panah
'feather an arrow'.
1.214 Another major group of -i verbs with noun bases
mean 'act as/be [base] with reference to object'. Thus in the
examples below Pak Irwan acts as sutradara 'director' of the
movie and Agassi is juara 'champion' of the tennis
tournament:
Pak Irwan menyutradarai film itu.
Mr Irwan directed that movie.
Petenis Amerika Agassi menjuarai turnamen tenis itu.
The American tennis player Agassi won the tennis
tournament.
Other verbs with noun bases and suffix -i with this function
include:
mengetuai chair (meeting)
membintangi star (in movie)
mensponsori sponsor
mengepalai head, lead
mewakili represent
merajai rule (over)
membuntuti trail after
melandasi underly, be the base for
mengawali precede
- memusuhi treat with hostility
mendalangi mastermind, manipulate
1.215 Suffix -i occurs with a limited number of adjective
bases. Most of these bases also occur with causative -kan (see
1.192). The -i form usually indicates that something is
applied to the object; it thus has a locative rather than
causative meaning. So memanasi (air) 'heat (water) byapplying heat to it , memanaskan (air) 'heat (water), for
instance, by moving it into the heat ; mengasini (ikan) 'salt
(fish) by adding salt to it', mengasinkan (ikan) 'salt fish, for
instance, by placing it in salt water'; memerahi (bibir) 'redden
(lips) by applying something red to them', memerahkan
'redden by any means'; mengeringi (sawah) 'dry (rice field)
by draining water from it', mengeringkan 'dry, for instance,
by putting out in sun'.
11Other verbs in this group include:
membasahi wet, dampen
memberati weigh down
memenuhi fill, fulfill
mencemari pollute, contaminate
menelanjangi uncover (secret); strip
menerangi light, illuminate
menghitami blacken
mengotori dirty, befoul
mengurangi reduce
1.216 A few -i verbs based on adjectives have somewhat
different meanings, where the function of -i is not easily
distinguished from that of -kan, including:
melengkapi complete
mendalami deepen
menghabisi finish off
mengurangi reduce
1.217 With bases which indicate approximation or relative
position the -i verb means 'become the distance indicated by
the base from the object'. Thus menjauhi 'avoid' means
'become jauh (far) from'. Bases are from a number of word
classes, including some locative nouns (see 2.120); thus
membawahi 'be underneath', from bawah 'underneath':
melalui pass (lalu past)
melampaui pass by, exceed (lampau past)
membawahi be underneath (bawah underneath)
mendampingi flank, stand beside (damping close)
mendekati approach (dekat near)
menengahi intervene; mediate (tengah middle)
menghampiri approach (hampir near)menjauhi avoid (jauh far)
1.218 A large number of -i verbs have verbal bases and
objects which indicate location. These verbs have intransitive
counterparts, as in the following examples:
berbohong lie : membohongi lie to
berkerumun swarm : mengerumuni swarm over
datang come : mendatangi visit, come to
duduk sit : menduduki sit on, occupy
hadir be present : menghadiri attend
jatuh fall : menjatuhi fall on
melangkah step : melangkahi step over
melompat jump : melompati jump over
menangis weep : menangisi weep over
menikah get married : menikahi marry (someone)
percaya believe : mempercayai trust, believe
tidur sleep : meniduri sleep on
1.219 Intransitive verbs such as those in the list in section
1.218 may take a prepositional phrase to indicate place,
means and so on (see 2.130), in which case the intransitive
verb plus preposition usually means the same as, or
something very similar to, the corresponding transitive verb:
Mereka hadir (di rapat itu).
They were present (at the meeting).
Mereka menghadiri rapat itu.
They attended that meeting.
Dia sudah menikah (dengan gadis itu).
He has married (that girl).
Dia sudah menikahi gadis itu.
He has married that girl.
For some of these intransitive verbs a prepositional phrase is
obligatory, as with tinggal di 'dwell in , the intransitive verb
and preposition corresponding in function to the -i verb.
Among verbs typically behaving like this are the emotives,
those which express emotions directed towards someone or
something, such as cinta 'love (prepositions following such
intransitive verbs are variable, as discussed in section 2.130):
Siapa yang tinggal di rumah ini?
Siapa yang meninggali rumah ini?
11Who lives in this house?
Pak Basri cinta akan istrinya.
Pak Basri mencintai istrinya.
Mr Basri loves his wife.
The following list exemplifies intransitive verbs which rarely
occur without a following preposition, together with their
transitive -i counterparts. Typical prepositions are also given.
With a few verbs prepositions are optional, as indicated by
parentheses:
benci akan : membenci hate
gemar akan : menggemari be fond of
masuk (ke dalam) enter : memasuki enter
sadar akan : menyadari be aware of
suka (akan) : menyukai like
tahu (akan) : mengetahui know
bertemu dengan : menemui meet
berkunjung ke : mengunjungi visit
berdiam di : mendiami dwell in
menyusup ke : menyusupi infiltrate
In a few cases there is some difference in meaning between
the intransitive verb plus preposition and the corresponding -i
verb:
marah pada angry at : memarahi scold
setuju dengan agree with (person or action) : menyetujui
agree with, approve (action)
1.220 All the -i verbs with verbal bases discussed in section
1.219 relate to intransitive verbs with a following preposition.
However, not all -i verbs with verbal bases correspond to
intransitive verbs in this way. Relating to some -i verbs are
intransitive verbs which are reflexive, such as menyerah
'surrender (oneself)', menyerahi 'hand over to, entrust to'.
For others there is no corresponding intransitive verb. Some
-i verbs relate to transitive simple verbs. Thus menulis 'write',
menulisi (kertas) 'write on (paper)'. Among verbs which do
not correspond in meaning to an intransitive verb plus
preposition are:
melayani serve
mengulangi repeatmempunyai have, possess
merintangi block, hamper
menaburi sprinkle
menyelidiki investigate
mengolesi smear
menutupi cover
menghalangi prevent, hamper
1.221 Another group of -i verbs are those sometimes called
ditransitive verbs, which are further discussed in section 3.20.
These verbs have a primary object and a secondary object.
With ditransitive -i verbs the primary object represents the
recipient of the action, that is, the one at whom the action is
directed, and the secondary object represents the patient. This
group is exemplified by mengirimi 'send to' and menyerahi
'hand over to':
Ayah mengirimi saya uang.
Father sent me money.
Kepala kantor menyerahi kami tugas yang berat.
The office head assigned us a heavy task.
Almost all these verbs have counterparts with suffix -kan, with
which the object represents the patient (see 1.190ff). A
number of verbs with noun bases are also ditransitive and can
be placed in this group, such as menghadiahi 'give to (object)
as a hadiah (gift)'. Some verbs in this group are given below,
along with typical primary and secondary objects:
memberi (dia uang) give (him money)
menawari (dia pekerjaan) offer (him a job)
menamai (dia Ali) name (him Ali)
menyuguhi (tamu minuman) offer (the guests a drink)
melimpahi (dia harta) give (him wealth) in abundance
menghadiahi (dia buku) give (him a book) as a gift
menganugerahi (mereka seorang putri) bless (them with
a daughter)
meminjami (dia buku) lend (him a book)
menyodori (dia buku) hand (him a book)
mencurahi (dia kekayaan) bestow upon (him wealth)
1.222 There are many other -i verbs which are not
ditransitive but which nevertheless have counterparts with-kan. The participant which is object with the -kan verb
occurs in a dengan phrase with the -i verb. (The relationship
between -i and -kan verbs is further discussed in 1.229ff.)
The following exemplify such -i verbs in sentences:
Dia menanami sawahnya dengan padi.
He planted his field with rice.
Para demonstran melempari wartawan dengan batu.
The demonstrators pelted the journalists with stones.
The prepositional phrase in such constructions is optional:
Dia menanami sawahnya.
He planted his field.
Some other verbs in this group are given below, with typical
objects and dengan phrases:
menyirami (bunga dengan air) spray (flowers with water)
mengolesi (badan dengan minyak) smear (body with oil)
melayani (tamu dengan makanan) serve (guest with
food)
memuati (truk dengan batu bara) load (truck with coal)
membebani (orang dengan tugas) burden (person with
duty)
menaburi (makanan dengan garam) sprinkle (food with
salt)
menghiasi (kamar dengan mawar) decorate (room with
roses)
membanjiri (negeri itu dengan uang) flood (the country
with money)
menutupi (mata dengan tangan) cover (eyes with hand)
menulisi (kertas dengan pena) write on (paper with pen)
English verbs translating -i locative verbs usually allow the
same object, as in the above examples, although with a few
verbs the Indonesian must be paraphrased or a different verb
chosen. For instance, melampiri 'enclose can take surat
'letter' as object where the corresponding English verb cannot;
the English verb 'enclose' requires a patient as object and thus
is actually a translation of the corresponding -kan verb:
Ayah melampiri surat dengan kwitansi.
Father enclosed a receipt in the letter.
1Other verbs which must be translated into English by a
paraphrase include:
menghujani (musuh dengan bom) rain on (enemy with
bombs)
menuangi (cangkir dengan teh) pour into (cup with tea)
The preposition dengan 'with' can be omitted under certain
circumstances in a passive construction (see 3.37).
Verbs with and without -/1.223 Some verbs occur in simple transitive form or with
suffix -i with different meanings. Besides those differences
which can be accounted for in terms of the regular functions
of -i, such as menulis 'write , menulisi 'write on', are
differences in meaning which are restricted to particular verbs
and are usually unpredictable, such as:
meliput cover an event (of a journalist) : meliputi cover
mendapat get : mendapati find
menunggu wait (for) : menunggui watch over
mengenal know : mengenali recognise, identify
mengajar teach : mengajari teach, train, coach
mengurus arrange, organise : mengurusi look after
1Optional -/1.224 With a number of words locative -i can be omitted
without change of meaning. Thus both menyeberang and
menyeberangi mean 'cross over':
Kita bisa menyeberang/menyeberangi jalan di sini.
We can cross the road here.
In the following examples optional -i is indicated in
parentheses:
menyiram(i) spray
menghias(i) decorate
mengikut(i) follow, obey
menerobos(i) break through
menggunjing(i) speak badly of
mendamprat(i) abuse, insult
mengiring(i) accompany
menurut(i) follow
menyuluh(i) light, illuminatemencicip(i) nibble
There is a considerable amount of variation in what different
speakers regard as acceptable. Thus some allow mengirim
instead of mengirimi 'send (someone something)', while
others regard -i as obligatory. Also, the frequency with
which -i occurs when it is optional varies from word to word.
For some speakers addition of -i to some words changes their
meaning while for others the suffix is optional and does not
change the meaning. Thus, some people distinguish
mengajar (mereka) 'teach (them)' and mengajari (mereka)
'train (them)'; others treat this as simply a case of optional -i.
Some people distinguish intransitive menyeberang 'cross
over' and transitive menyeberangi, although other
Indonesians treat the -i as optional before an object (but
obligatorily absent if there is no object - see 3.21).
8Locative verbs without -/1.225 A number of verbs occur as simple transitives where
-i might be expected because the object is locative. Thus
menyumbang has a locative object, this participant being
marked by kepada with the corresponding -kan verb:
Kami menyumbang mereka dengan uang.
We support them with money.
Kami menyumbangkan uang kepada mereka.
We contribute money to them.
Some verbs in this group have -kan counterparts with
'instrumental' meaning (see 1.205). Some others have noun
bases (see 1.188). Among these verbs are:
mengetuk (pintu) knock on (door)
menyemprot spray
menambah (pengetahuan) add to (knowledge)
menyemir polish
mengingat remember
memborgol handcuff
Thus Dardjowidjojo (1978: 352) allows both Saya mengirimi
mereka uang saku and Saya mengirim mereka uang saku 'l
send them pocket money', while Johns (1978: 232) treats -i as
obligatory in Paman mengirimi saya uang tiap bulan
'Uncle sent me some money every month'.","[110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"
"Some grammars of Indonesian do not use the terms active
and passive, instead using such terms as subject and object
construction or subjective and objective focus. This is
because there are differences between the constructions in
Indonesian and the active and passive in European languages
such as English, in both structure and function. Nevertheless,
there are also important similarities, and the relationship
between the two constructions is often similar to the
relationship between active and passive in English, allowing
the same terms to be used to describe them. The structure of
a passive clause can be described in terms of a transformation
from the corresponding active.
The passive construction is more frequent in Indonesian than
in English. Where a passive translation would sound
unnatural, translation by an active construction is usually
given in the following sections.
The Indonesian passive has two different forms, called here
'passive type one' and 'passive type two' . The choice of
passive type is determined by the actor.
1Passive Type One3.27 In this type of passive the actor is third person, that is
pronoun dia or mereka, or a noun. Passive type one is also
used if no actor is expressed. The structure of an active
clause and its corresponding passive type one are set out as
follows:
Active voice:
Subject (actor) + meN-verb + Object (patient)
Passive voice:
Subject (patient) + di-verb + (oleh) + Agent
(actor)
These structures are illustrated by the following active clause
and its passive transformation:
Dia menjemput saya.
He met me.
The terms 'passive type one' and 'passive type two are used by
Dardjowidjojo (1978).
1Saya dijemput oieh dia.
I was met by him.
In the above example the actor is dia 'he'. The following
illustrate passives with the other possible actors, mereka, a
noun or no actor expressed:
Dia sudah diberi uang itu oleh mereka.
He has already been given the money by them.
Surat ini ditulis oleh Tomo.
This letter was written by Tomo.
Barang ini akan dikirim ke Jepang.
These goods will be sent to Japan.
A third person singular agent can be expressed by either dia
or -nya. They are optionally preceded by oleh 'by':
Saya dijemputnya/olehnya.
Saya dijemput dia/oleh dia.
I was met by him.
Oleh is always optional except when the agent does not
immediately follow the verb, in which case it is obligatory.
This occurs when another clause element comes between the
verb and agent or when the agent is placed before the verb to
receive highlighting (see 3.47).
In passive type one the components of the predicate (see
2.132ff) apart from the verb remain unchanged:
Mereka sudah dijemputnya.
They have already been met by him.
Mereka tidak harus dijemputnya.
They do not have to be met by him.
While makan 'eat', minum 'drink' and a few other transitive
verbs usually occur without prefix meN- in active voice (see
1.186), they take di- in the passive: dimakan 'eaten', diminum
'drunk'. The verb mengerti 'understand' retains its prefix
meN- in the passive (see 1.186): dimengerti 'understood'.
Passive Type Two3.28 In passive type two the agent is a pronoun or
pronoun substitute (see 2.67). The agent phrase comesbefore the verb, which does not have a prefix. The structure
of passive type two is thus:
Subject (patient) + Agent (actor) + Verb
The following example shows the relationship between an
active clause and a passive type two clause:
Kami menjemput dia.
We met him.
Dia kami jemput
He was met by us.
No other component of the clause can come between the
agent and the verb in passive type two. In particular,
components of the predicate phrase (see 2.132ff), such as
negative and temporal marker, come before the agent in
passive type two:
Buku ini tidak akan kami baca.
This book will not be read by us.
If the agent is aku T or kamu 'you', the bound forms, ku- and
kau- respectively (see 2.71), usually occur:
Buku ini sudah kubaca.
I've read this book.

Choosing Passive Type3.29 When an active clause is transformed into a passive
two things must be considered in deciding if the passive is to
be passive type one or two: Is the actor first, second or third
person? and: Is the actor a pronoun (including a pronoun
substitute) or is it a noun?
Nouns and pronouns can be distinguished as follows:
2Although sentences with oleh saya and so on (passive type
one with first or second person agent) are regarded as ungrammatical
they do occur in spontaneous speech, even among educated
speakers, especially if the agent is added as an afterthought.","[274, 275, 276, 277]"
"Demonstrative pronouns2.65 The demonstratives ini 'this and itu 'that (see 2.7)
can occur alone as demonstrative pronouns. In the following
examples they occur as subject of a clause:
Ini besar.
This is big.
Itu teman saya.
That is my friend.
11Personal pronouns2.66 Pronouns which refer to people are called personal^
pronouns. These can occur as heads of personal pronoun
phrases (see 2.75-81).
Personal pronouns reflect social relations between people far
more than do other parts of the language and a brief
discussion of their social role is required.
Only a limited number of words are purely pronominal. The
full forms of these are:
first
second
third
single saya, aku
engkau, kamu, ia, dia,
kau, anda
beliau
plural kita kami kalian
mereka
inci. excl.
The first singular forms both mean T but differ in social
distribution, as discussed below. The inclusive first plural kita
means 'we where the person being spoken to is included, that
is, T and you', while the exclusive first plural kami means 'we'
where the person being spoken to is excluded, that is, 'I and
others but not you . The second person pronouns are all
restricted in social usage. However, the third person forms are
socially neutral except beliau 'he, she (respectful)'.
11Pronouns aku 'I' and engkau, kau, kamu 'you singular' and
kalian 'you plural' (a recently created form not used by all
speakers) are intimate forms, used to children and between
equals who have a close relationship with each other. They
are sometimes used to younger adults, although this alwaysconveys a suggestion of social superiority on the part of the
speaker.
The pronouns saya T and anda 'you are often said to be
neutral in social connotation. This is largely true of saya,
although its use instead of aku usually indicates that an
intimate relationship does not exist. However, anda conveys
social information, as discussed below.
1The pronouns kita 'we (inclusive)', kami 'we (exclusive)', ia,
dia 'he, she', and mereka 'they' are socially neutral. Of the
third person pronouns only beliau 'he, she' carries social
connotation, referring to people who are held in high respect.
It is among second person pronouns, those used for the
person being addressed, that most variety occurs.
Anda, an artificial creation introduced in the 1950s, was
intended as a neutral form, equivalent to English 'you'.
However, the mere fact that it does not convey the intimacy of
engkau, kau and kamu, nor indicate a kin relationship, meant
that it was immediately confined to impersonal situations,
such as addressing strangers of the same age as or younger
than the speaker. It is not widely used in addressing
individuals and, because it does not convey respect, cannot be
used by a junior to a senior. As an impersonal form it is most
frequently used in advertisements and public announcements,
and in addressing people in gatherings such as conferences.
The first example below is a notice in aeroplanes, while the
second is taken from an advertisement:
Kenakan sabuk pengaman selama anda duduk.
Fasten your safety belt while you are seated.
Apakah mesin fotokopi anda mencemari lingkungan?
Does your photocopier pollute the environment?
Pronoun substitutes2.67 Pronoun substitutes are personal names and kinship
terms used instead of pronouns. Saudara 'sibling or relative
of the same generation', like anda, is used widely for 'you' to
people of the speaker's own generation or younger and has an
impersonal tone, generally being used towards people withwhom the speaker is not well acquainted. To females saudari
(see 1.42) is sometimes used.
The other pronoun substitutes can mean either T or 'you'.
Most common are bapak 'father' and ibu 'mother'. These are
respectful forms used to older people or to any adult of
marriagable age:
Bapak tinggal di sini?
Do you live here? (said to an older man)
Apa ini anak ibu?
Is this your child? (said to an older woman)
Like all pronoun substitutes, these terms are basically nouns,
used for referring to a third person. Thus the two sentences
above literally mean 'Does father live here?' and 'Is this
mother's child?' and can also be used in reference to a third
person, context making clear which is meant.
The abbreviated forms pak and bu cannot be used alone as
pronoun substitutes, that is, they cannot mean 'you', occurring
only as vocatives (see 4.109) in most people's usage.
However, in combination with a name they can be used as
terms for reference to a third person or in addressing a
second person, that is as pronoun substitutes:
Pak Hasan mau makan sekarang?
Do you want to eat now, Mr Hasan?
The above sentence could also be a question about a third
person, 'Does Mr Hasan want to eat now?'
Other abbreviated kinship terms can also combine with names
and be used in addressing another person: Mas Tomo 'older
brother Tomo', Mbak Yuli 'older sister Yuli', Dik Muji
'ypunger brother Muji'. There is a considerable amount of
regional variation in the use of such terms.
Tuan 'sir' and nyonya 'madam' (to a married woman) have a
much more limited role in modern Indonesian than in the
past but are still used by some people, especially to
foreigners. Like pak and ibu they can also be used with
personal names.","[187, 188, 189, 190]"

Department of Employment, Education and Training (through the
National TIFL Project). Thanks are due to Frances Christie, Peter
Worsley, David Reeve, George Quinn, and members of the National
TIFL Steering Committee, together with Professor Moegiadi,
Education and Cultural Attache at the Indonesian Embassy, whose
support enabled me to obtain the grant. The work has benefitted from
discussions with numerous people, including Margaret Bocquet-Siek,
Lynette Bowyer, Anita Broome, Musnarti Dickinson, Robyn
Northcote, Hein Steinhauer, and Marcus Susanto. Of great value were
the insights of the late Jack Prentice, provided in discussions and
unpublished lecture notes.
Jennilyn Mann also deserves my thanks for a most meticulous job in
preparing the manuscript for publication.
I express deepest gratitude to my wife Susan and children Caroline and
David, who had to put up with many difficulties during the preparation
of this work, including my long absences in Indonesia.
Many people have been very supportive in Indonesia. I especially
thank the Suparto family in Jakarta, whose friendship and hospitality
over many years has contributed greatly to the success of my work.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"Narti is waiting for me/you/him.
Third person -nya can be plural, meaning 'they', as well as
singular (this is not the case with dia/ia):
Mahasiswa-mahasiswa ini akan melanjutkan
pendidikannya di luar negeri.
These students will continue their education overseas.
Mereka akan membuat rencana dan segala sesuatu akan
diaturnya sesuai dengan rencana itu.
They will make a plan and they will organise everything in
accordance with that plan.
Pronouns indicating possession2.72 Indicating possession pronouns must follow a noun;
phrasal forms corresponding to 'mine , 'his , and so on, do not
occur. This may require repetition of a noun:
Mobil ini mobil saya.
This car is mine.
11To avoid repetition the first occurrence of the noun is usually
omitted. Alternatively the possessive pronoun may be
attached to a form like kepunyaan 'possession', milik
'property':
Ini mobil saya.
This is my car.
Mobil ini kepunyaan saya.
This car is mine (my possession).
As mentioned in section 2.71, singular pronouns can occur in
their free or bound (suffixed) form to mark possession.
Pronouns referring to non-humans2.73 Most speakers use third person pronouns dia/ia and
mereka only to refer to humans. The bound form -nya can
refer to non-human animate and inanimate nouns, both single
and plural:
Apa namanya?
What's its name?/What are their names?
Saya sudah membacanya.
I've read it/them.","[194, 195]"
"Some non-count nouns can be used as count nouns when the
context makes it clear that a certain measure or amount is
being referred to. Thus kopi 'coffee' is a non-count noun but
if, in a restaurant for instance, one asks for dua kopi 'two
coffees', it is clear that what one means is dua cangkir/gelas
kopi 'two cups/glasses of coffee'.
2.4
A noun can occur alone in a phrase, in which case
the phrase consists solely of its head word. The following
construction, a clause, consists of two noun phrases, one the
subject and one the predicate, each phrase consisting of a
single noun:
Ali guru.
Ali is a teacher.
Noun phrases
2.5
Nouns act as heads of a great variety of different
phrase structures. Some of the important components of
noun phrases are discussed in the following sections. Not all
nouns can occur with all the phrase elements discussed; some
subclasses of noun are restricted in the elements with which
they can cooccur.
Demonstratives2.6
The demonstratives are ini 'this', itu 'that', tersebut
'already mentioned', and tadi 'recently mentioned'.
2.7
The demonstratives ini 'this' and itu 'that' follow the
head noun. As they do not distinguish between one and more
than one they also translate 'these' and 'those' respectively:
buku ini this book
kedua buku ini these two books
negeri itu that country
negeri-negeri itu those countries
Demonstratives can occur with all classes of nouns including
proper nouns:
Jakarta ini this (city of) Jakarta
Siti itu that (girl) SitiBoth Ini and itu can refer to someone or something
previously mentioned but not now present:
Bagaimana rumah itu?
What is that house (about which we have been talking)
like?
Orang ini baik sekali»
This person (who we are talking about) is very good.
They can also refer to something physically present, as when
pointing:
Saya tinggal di rumah ini.
I live in this house.
Duduk di kursi itu.
Sit in that chair.
When referring to something present, but not when referring
to something previously mentioned but not now present, ini
and itu can optionally be preceded by yang for emphasis:
Rumah besar itu rumah Tomo; saya tinggal di rumah
yang ini.
That big house is Tomo's; I live in this house.
Tulis di buku yang itu; ini buku saya.
Write in that book; this book is mine.
Besides referring to something being pointed at or something
previously mentioned, itu can also be used with generic
nouns:
Harimau itu binatang liar.
The tiger is a wild animal.
In the above sentence harimau itu, like the English 'the tiger ,
refers to all members of the group. Likewise, itu can be used
with certain nominalised verbal clauses (see 3.143), referring
to all instances of the action:
Lari itu sehat.
Running is healthy.
12.8
The use of itu sometimes proves a difficulty for
many English speakers, sometimes inaccurately being equated
with 'the'. While both words refer to something definite, a
number of differences occur in their usage. In English 'the is
1obligatory with a noun which refers to something unique,
whereas itu cannot occur in this context:
matahari the sun
bulan the moon
Many nouns refer to something which is unique to one
context but may not be unique in other contexts. Thus
perdana menteri 'prime minister refers to someone unique in
the discussion of a particular country but not in a discussion
referring to a number of countries. Where it is unique, as in
the first sentence below, itu cannot occur; where it is not
unique, as in the second sentence, itu can occur:
Perdana menteri sudah pulang.
The Prime Minister has returned home.
Kedua perdana menteri itu bersalaman.
The two prime ministers greeted each other.
1In English 'the can refer to something not previously
mentioned, whereas itu cannot. This matter is further
discussed in section 2.50.
12.9
When a non-unique noun has previously been
mentioned it is usually marked by itu if there is nothing else
in the phrase to indicate that it refers back to what has already
been mentioned. Thus in Orang itu teman saya That person
is my friend', orang 'person cannot occur alone because there
is nothing to tell that it refers to someone already mentioned
or being pointed to; only itu marks it as definite, and
therefore already mentioned. If something else marks the
noun as definite itu need not occur (see for instance 3.98).
12.10 In formal writing tersebut 'previously mentioned' is
sometimes used to refer to someone or something already
mentioned:
Alasan itu dikemukakan oleh para guru bahasa tersebut.
That reason was put forward by the previously mentioned
language teachers.
2.11 Although tadi 'just recently' usually occurs as an
adjunct of time (see 2.191) it can follow a noun to refer back
to someone or something recently mentioned or recently
present:Kedua pacar tadi sekarang sudah menjadi suami istri»
The two lovers (who were mentioned a short while ago)
have now become husband and wife.
Anaknya mengintip adegan seram tadi.
His child spied the frightening scene (just referred to).
Bagaimana pendapat saudara tentang orang tadi?
What's your opionion of that person (who was here a
moment ago)?
Quantifiers2.12 There are several types of quantifier, including
definite and indefinite numbers. Partitives, which indicate
amount, combine with numbers to form quantifiers.
Classifiers are not themselves quantifiers. However, as they
behave in some ways similar to partitives and must occur with
a number, they are included in this section.
Numbers2.13 Numbers are either definite or indefinite. Definite
numbers include cardinal and ordinal numbers, and fractions.
In sections 2.14 to 2.20 numbers as a component of noun
phrases are discussed. The internal structure of number
phrases is discussed in sections 2.106 to 2.117.
2.14 A cardinal number precedes a count noun (see 2.3)
to indicate the number of things being referred to:
dua orang two people sepuluh kota ten towns
Cardinal numbers are listed in section 2.107.
2.15 A cardinal number can occur after a noun to
indicate its position in a series. Cardinal numbers are only
used in this way with things which are commonly
distinguished from each other by their position within a
sequence. A question as to the position of the noun in the
sequence is asked by placing berapa after the noun (see
4.19). The contrast between occurrence of cardinals before
and after the head noun is shown in the following examples:
lima jam five hours : jam lima five o'clock
tiga halaman three pages : halaman tiga page three
dua kelas two classes : kelas dua class twoWith dates cardinals are used rather than ordinals:
Mereka akan tiba pada tanggal enam Maret.
They will arrive on the sixth of March.
Cardinals also follow the word nomor 'number' to indicate a
number in a series:
Jalan Persahabatan nomor tujuh
number seven Persahabatan Street
bis nomor 14
bus number 14
2.16 With nouns which are not usually distinguished by
their order in a sequence cardinal numbers cannot be used as
described in section 2.15; instead ordinal numbers (see
1.151) are used. These follow the head noun:
orang ketiga the third person
minggu keenam the sixth week
Frequently yang precedes the c.dinal:
Ali anaknya yang kedua.
Ali is his second child.
2.17 Ordinal numbers from kedua upwards can also
occur before the noun as collective numbers to indicate an
inclusive group of that many, 'both', 'all three' and so on.
Since the noun they refer to is always definite it is always
marked by a demonstrative, a possessive or some other
element which identifies it:
Saya sudah membaca keempat buku itu.
I've read those four books.
Kelima anaknya pandai.
All five of her children are clever.
When a specific group is not referred to the collective number
is replaced by a cardinal number.
Saya sudah membaca empat buku minggu ini.
I've read four books this week.
2.18 Fractions (see 1.149) precede the noun and indicate
how large a part of something is compared to the whole:
Dua pertiga orang Indonesia tinggal di pulau Jawa.","[156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161]"
"There is therefore always an associated transitive verb. The
meaning is often expressed in Indonesian as apa yang di[base] 'what is [base]-ed\ where [base] is the meaning of the
verb base. Thus makanan 'food is apa yang dimakan 'what
is eaten', pakaian 'clothes' is apa yang dipakai 'what is worn'.
1This is a large, productive set of nouns, including:
lukisan picture
minuman drink
tulisan writing
kenalan acquaintance
ukiran carving
pinjaman loan
sumbangan contribution
pilihan choice
tanaman plant
tujuan destination
1.60 While these nouns all relate to the object of the
corresponding verb, further subgrouping on semantic
grounds is possible. Thus some refer to something which
results from the action, such as tulisan 'writing' and ukiran
'carving', while others refer to something already existing
which is subjected to the action, such as makanan 'food' and
minuman 'drink'.
1.61 One subset of nouns in this group typically act as
modifiers to another noun (see 2.37), although some can
occur alone with the same meaning. They tend to be
translated by adjectives in English:
(barang) curian stolen (goods)
(binatang) buruan game (animal)
(budak) belian bought (slave)
(rumah) sewaan rented (house)
(sapi) perahan milch (cow)
1.62 The second important group of -an nouns with verb
bases are action nouns (see 2.53). These describe the action
of the verb and can occur as head of a phrase containing
prepositions such as terhadap. Thus serangan 'attack', as in
the noun phrase serangan terhadap musuh 'an attack on the
enemy , expresses the same action as the verb menyerang
'attack', as in the construction Mereka menyerang musuh
1'They attacked the enemy . This is also a large, productive set
of nouns and includes:
tentangan challenge
ancaman threat
kecaman criticism
balasan response
tuntutan demand
bantuan help
tekanan pressure
keluhan complaint
larangan prohibition
tembakan shooting
11.63 With some verb bases -an derives nouns indicating
the instrument with which the action is performed or the place
where the action occurs. With some nouns the instrumental or
locative meaning is clear while for others either interpretation
is possible. Thus timbangan 'scales' can be interpreted as
either the instrument with which one weighs (menimbang
'weigh') or the place where weighing takes place:
ayunan cradle
gilingan mill
kendaraan vehicle
bendungan dam
saluran channel
parkiran parking place
angkutan transport
pikulan carrying pole
boncengan pillion, bicycle rack
gantungan hanger (for clothes)
1.64 -an can also occur with noun bases. Sometimes it
has the same meaning as the base, or a meaning which varies
only slightly from that of the base, such as peran, peranan
'role , while with other words there is a clear difference in
meaning. It may indicate a magnification of the base, thus
laut 'sea , lautan 'ocean'. It may have the same meaning as the
base but with an additional extension of that meaning, thus
pinggir 'edge', pinggiran 'edge, outskirts'. In some cases the
difference in meaning is unpredictable, such as akhir 'end',
akhiran 'suffix':
darat (dry) land : daratan mainland
' gambar picture : gambaran description
keluh sigh, groan : keluhan groan, complaint
pasar market : pasaran (international) market
ruang space, room : ruangan space, (large) room
kubang, kubangan mudhole
landas, landasan base, substratum
gugus, gugusan group, cluster
111.65 One group of -an nouns based on nouns derive
words which do not differ in meaning from the base but have
a different distribution. The base alone typically occurs as a
partitive (see 2.29) indicating a natural or artificial grouping
or piece of something, and is always preceded by a number,
most commonly se- 'one . The -an form occurs as the head
of a noun phrase and can have a noun modifier (see 2.37).
Typically both constructions have the same translation in
English:
sederet rumah
deretan rumah
a row of houses
Dia membawa seikat jerami/Dia membawa ikatan
jerami*
He was carrying a bundle of hay.
1While the base usually occurs in a partitive construction with a
preceding number, and is thus always indefinite, the -an form
can be specific, occurring without a number, either alone or
with a determiner:
deretan itu that row
ikatan ini this bundle
The following examples give only the -an form, but the base
also has the same translation:
gugusan group, cluster
lembaran sheet, page
jajaran row, line
pasangan pair
kawanan herd, flock
rangkaian series
kepingan chip, fragment
timbunan heap, pile
1.66 Suffix -an can occur with a reduplicated noun base.
There are two major functions.
1.67 The word can indicate a variety of what is indicated
by the base. This formation is especially common with words
for plants:
obat-obatan medicines
pohon-pohonan (all kinds of) trees
padi-padian cereals
bunga-bungaan (all kinds of) flowers
daun-daunan foliagerumput-rumputan grasses, weeds
sayur-sayuran vegetables
umbi-umbian (various) edible tubers
buah-buahan fruits
tari-tarian (various kinds of) dances
1.68 The word can indicate a diminutive or something
which resembles or imitates what the base specifies. With this
function the construction is quite productive and people often
create new forms to refer to toys:
mobil-mobilan toy car
rumah-rumahan doll's house
bulan-bulanan target
kuda-kudaan toy horse, hobbyhorse
kapal-kapalan toy boat
perang-perangan manoeuvres
burung-burungan toy bird
orang-orangan puppet; scarecrow
1.69 A few of the forms described in 1.67 with full
reduplication of the base can alternatively occur with partial
reduplication:
pepohonan trees
rerumputan weeds
dedaunan foliage, greenery
1.70 A few forms, with either full or partial reduplication,
have verbal bases:
reruntuhan ruins (runtuh collapse)
tumbuh-tumbuhan, tetumbuhan (all sorts of) plants
(tumbuh grow)
goreng-gorengan fried foods (goreng fry)
sesajian (temple) offerings (saji offer)
1.71 With adjective bases -an derives nouns which refer to
something having the characteristic specified by the base:
asam sour : asaman pickles
kotor dirty : kotoran excrement, garbage
lanjut advanced : lanjutan continuation
manis sweet : manisan sweets
samar indistinct, vague : samaran camouflage, disguiseCircumfix ke-...-an1.72 Circumfix ke-...-an forms nouns from adjectives,
verbs and other classes. Such nouns are generally of an
abstract nature.
1.73 Ke-...-an nouns can have an adjective base. The
nouns are all abstract, identifying the characteristic of the
adjective:
baik good : kebaikan goodness, kindness
bebas free : kebebasan freedom
bersih clean : kebersihan cleanliness
cantik beautiful : kecantikan beauty
sehat healthy : kesehatan health
sulit difficult : kesulitan difficulty
1.74 In general the meaning of the noun can be predicted
from the meaning of the adjective base. In a few cases this is
not so:
berat heavy : keberatan objection
malu shy : kemaluan genitals
terang clear : keterangan explanation
1.75 The negative tidak 'not' can combine with some
adjectives to form a compound base for ke-...-an nouns.
These correspond to English nouns with prefix dis- or in-:
adil just : ketidak-adilan injustice
jujur honest : ketidak-jujuran dishonesty
puas satisfied : ketidak-puasan dissatisfaction
senang pleased : ketidak-senangan displeasure
1.76 Several adjectives derived with prefix se- (see 1.127)
can form the base of a ke-...-an noun:
seimbang balanced : keseimbangan balance, equilibrium
sesuai appropriate, suitable : kesesuaian suitability,
compatibility
seragam uniform, of the same kind : keseragaman
uniformity
1.77 The noun can be formed from an intransitive verb:
datang come : kedatangan arrival
hidup live : kehidupan lifeingin wish : keinginan wish, desire
lahir be born : kelahiran birth
menang win : kemenangan victory
naik go up : kenaikan rise, increase
1.78 The base can be a verb with prefix ber- or ter-. In
this case the prefix remains:
berangkat depart : keberangkatan departure
berhasil succeed : keberhasilan success
terbatas limited : keterbatasan limitation
tersedia available : ketersediaan availability
1.79 A few nouns are formed from a negated verb or
have a compound verb base:
tahu know : ketidak-tahuan ignorance
ikut serta participate : keikut-sertaan participation
1.80 A few ke-.„-an nouns are based on modals (see
2J 53) or adverbs:
boleh may : kebolehan ability, skill
harus must : keharusan necessity, a must
kerap frequently : kekerapan frequency
lebih more : kelebihan excess
mungkin possible : kemungkinan possibility
1.81 ke-...-an nouns can be based on nouns; this use is
very productive and many forms are recent in the language.
The ke-...-an forms in general mean 'having to do with
[base]'. Some forms have a different translation from the
base:
anggota member : keanggotaan membership
daerah region : kedaerahan regionalism
ibu mother : keibuan motherliness
pemimpin leader : kepemimpinan leadership
wanita woman : kewanitaan femininity
1.82 Many ke-...-an nouns with noun bases typically
modify another noun. Thus keagamaan 'having to do with
religion' occurs in such phrases as upacara keagamaan
'religious ceremony'. Sometimes the translation depends on
context; thus kebangsaan is translated differently in thephrases kebangsaan kapal itu 'nationality of the ship' and
lagu kebangsaan 'national song'. When modifying another
noun it is frequently translated by an adjective, as in the case
of keagamaan above. In other cases the ke-...-an noun has
the same translation as the base. Thus penduduk 'population'
and (teori) kependudukan 'population (theory)'. In either
case such nouns are best glossed 'having to do with [base]',
except where context makes their meaning clear, as in the
following examples:
kedokteran medical, having to do with doctors : fakultas
kedokteran faculty of medicine
kehutanan forestry, having to do with forests : petugas
kehutanan forestry official
kepolisian having to do with police : akademi kepolisian
police academy
keuangan finance, finances : departemen keuangan
department of finance; soal keuangan financial matters
kemasyarakatan social, having to do with society or
community : masalah kemasyarakatan community
problem
kemahasiswaan having to do with students : hidup
kemahasiswaan student life
keimigrasian having to do with immigration : undangundang keimigrasian immigration laws
1.83 In a few cases ke-...-an nouns are formed from
nouns already having prefix peN-, such as kependudukan
'having to do with population' (penduduk population
menduduki occupy) and kepemimpinan leadership
(pemimpin leader, pimpin lead).
1.84 With noun bases indicating a person holding a rank
or office, ke-...-an forms nouns meaning 'the domain
administered by [base]':
duta ambassador : kedutaan embassy
kaiser emperor : kekaisaran empire
lurah village head : kelurahan administrative unit headed
by a lurah
menteri minister : kementerian department headed by a
minister
raja king : kerajaan kingdomsultan sultan : kesultanan sultanate
1.85 With a very few noun bases ke-...-an forms nouns
indicating a collection of [base]:
pulau island : kepulauan archipelago
pustaka book (archaic) : kepustakaan bibliography, list
of references
1.86 A few nouns are derived from numbers, both
definite and indefinite (see 2.106ff), meaning 'a group which
consists of [base] :
satu one : kesatuan unit
sebelas eleven : kesebelasan eleven (soccer team)
seluruh whole : keseluruhan entirety
1Circumfix peN~...-an1.87 Most nouns with peN-...-an have verbal bases. They
refer to the action expressed by the corresponding transitive
verb and are often translatable 'the act of doing what the verb
refers to'. They can occur with an indication of length of
time or with such verbs as dilakukan 'carried out'. In the first
example below penulisan 'the act of writing, the writing'
relates to menulis 'write'; in the second pengumpulkan 'the act
of collecting' relates to mengumpulkan 'collect', and so on:
Penulisan buku itu memerlukan dua tahun.
The writing of that book took two years.
Pengumpulan cerita-cerita itu dilakukan di New York.
The collecting of these stories was done in New York.
Amerika Serikat telah menghentikan pengiriman bahan
makanan.
The USA has stopped the sending of foodstuffs.
Kedua kepala negara menyaksikan penandatanganan
perjanjian kerja sama.
The two heads of state witnessed the signing of the
cooperation agreement.
In the above examples the peN-...-an nouns are all translated
by '-ing' verbs. Some peN-...-an nouns, however, usually
correspond to English nouns which also translate
corresponding -an nouns (see 1.59). Thus, while
penerjemahan can be translated 'the translating', it is morecommon for 'translation to occur in English, which also
1translates terjemahan. On the other hand, some -an nouns
are translated with '-ing' verbs; thus tulisan and penulisan
both translate 'writing . However, the meanings of the two are
always distinct, the peN-...-an noun referring to the action, the
-an noun referring to the result of the action. This is further
discussed in section 1.116.
1This is a productive affixation and applies very freely to
transitive verbs:
pelaksanaan implementation, implementing
pembacaan reading
pencetakan printing
penembakan shooting
pengecekan checking (of facts)
pengiriman dispatch(ing), sending
pengusiran expulsion, expelling
penjualan selling
1.88 Where meN- cooccurs with prefixes per- (see
1.234ff) and ber- (see 1.199), so too can peN-„.-an. If meNalso occurs without those affixes contrasting peN-...-an nouns
sometimes also occur. Preceded by peN- the initial p of peris lost (see 1.6):
memberlakukan apply (rules) : pemberlakuan
application (of rules)
memperoleh get, acquire : pemerolehan process of
acquiring
memberhentikan dismiss : pemberhentian dismissal, cf.
menghentikan stop : penghentian stopping, cessation
mempersatukan unite : pemersatuan unification, cf.
menyatukan unite : penyatuan unification
1.89 Nouns derived with peN-...-an can also correspond
to intransitive verbs with prefix meN- (see 1.179). If there is
an intransitive meN- verb and a transitive verb having the
same base there may be peN-..»-an nouns corresponding to
each of them. Thus penyerahan '(act of) surrendering, the
surrender' corresponds both to intransitive menyerah
'surrender, give in' and transitive menyerahkan 'surrender,
hand over, transfer':Penyerahaan tentara Jepang terjadi bulan Agustus.
The surrender of the Japanese army occurred in August.
Penyerahaan surat-surat itu dituntut oleh jaksa.
The handing over of the documents was demanded by the
prosecutor.
Other examples of peN-...-an nouns relating to both transitive
and intransitive verbs are:
pendaratan landing : mendarat land (intr.),
mendaratkan land (trans.)
pendaftaran registration : mendaftar register (intr.),
mendaftarkan register (trans.)
1.90 If two transitive verbs have the same base then a
peN-...-an noun may correspond to only one of them:
penemuan discovery : menemukan discover, cf.
menemui meet
pembangunan development : membangun develop, cf.
membangunkan wake up
On the other hand, there may be a peN-...-an noun
corresponding to each of the verbs:
menerangi light, illuminate : penerangan lighting,
illumination; menerangkan explain : penerangan
explanation
menembak shoot (someone) : penembakan shooting (of
someone); menembakkan fire (a bullet) :
penembakan firing (of a bullet)
1.91 In some cases a peN-...-an noun corresponds to the
object of an action as well as, or instead of, corresponding to
the act. Thus penemuan means 'discovery' in the sense of
'something discovered' as well as 'the act of discovering'.
Some nouns, like pengetahuan 'knowledge (what is known)'
and peninggalan 'remains; inheritance (what is left behind)'
relate only to the object of the verb. Other nouns which relate
to the object of the corresponding verb include:
memandang view, observe : pemandangan view, scenery
mengumumkan announce : pengumuman
announcement1.92 A number of peN-..-an nouns refer to the place
where the action of the corresponding verb typically occurs.
They usually also relate to the action:
menggiling mill : penggilingan mill (place); act of
milling
mencuci wash : pencucian laundry; act of washing
membuang exile : pembuangan place of exile; act of
exiling
membakar burn : pembakaran place for burning; act of
burning
menginap spend the night : penginapan lodging, inn
Circumfix per-...-an1.93 Many nouns with this affixation relate to verbs with
prefix ber-. They indicate the process or result of the action
referred to by the corresponding verb:
bekerja work : pekerjaan work
belajar study : pelajaran lesson
bergerak move : pergerakan movement
berjanji promise : perjanjian promise, agreement
bersatu unite : persatuan unity
bertemu meet : pertemuan meeting
1.94 Some per-...-an nouns correspond to transitive
verbs, indicating the act of doing what the verb indicates:
menolong help : pertolongan help, assistance
mengingatkan warn, remind : peringatan warning
mencoba try : percobaan experiment; attempt
memohon request : permohonan request
mengatur put in order : peraturan regulation
melawan oppose : perlawanan opposition
1.95 Some per-...-an nouns refer to the place where the
action of the corresponding verb occurs:
berhenti stop : perhentian stopping place
berjudi gamble : perjudian place for gambling
mencetak print : percetakan printery
menenun weave : pertenunan textile mill
1.96 Verbs with prefix per- (see 1.234ff) always have
associated nouns with per-...-an, never with -an (see 1.57ff).","[59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69]"
"free pronouns. Prefixed pronouns cannot act as phrase
heads.
Demonstratives2.76 The demonstrative ini gives emphasis to first person
pronouns:
Kau kira saya ini pelayanmu?
Do you think I am your servant?
With third person itu can occur to indicate location or
previous mention:
mereka itu
they (over there) or they (who have been mentioned)
Relative clauses in personal pronoun phrases2.77 Adjectives must be preceded by yang in pronoun
phrases. They are thus relative clauses (see 3.98):
saya yang kecil ini I who am small
kamu yang pandai you who are clever
Apart from adjectives, relative clauses occur only after
mereka. In this case the pronoun acts like orang, meaning
'people who..., those who...':
mereka yang tetap tinggal di desa
those who continue to live in the village
mereka yang tidak hadir
those who are not present
Numbers in pronoun phrases2.78 A limited number of definite and indefinite numbers
are the only quantifiers which occur with personal pronouns.
2.79 Numbers with prefix ber- (see 1.158) are the only
definite numbers which can accompany pronouns. Following
a pronoun they indicate a group, having the same meaning as
collective numbers with ke- preceding a noun (see 2.17):
mereka berdua
both of them
Kita bertiga menghadap kepala sekolah.
The three of us appeared before the school principal.","[196, 197]"
"While such nouns are listed here as having circumfix per-...
-an, an alternative interpretation would be to treat them as
retaining verbal prefix per- on the base to which suffix -an is
then attached:
memperbaiki repair, improve : perbaikan repairs,
improvement
memperhatikan pay attention to : perhatian attention
memperhitungkan calculate : perhitungan calculation
mempertimbangkan consider : pertimbangan
consideration
1.97 Per-...-an nouns with noun bases may indicate
'having to do with [base], affairs dealing with [base]':
budak slave : perbudakan slavery
musuh enemy : permusuhan enmity, hostility
saudara brother : persaudaraan brotherhood, friendship
sekutu ally : persekutuan alliance
undang-undang law : perundang-undangan legislation
wakil deputy, representative : perwakilan representation,
delegation
1.98 As is the case with abstract ke-...-an nouns (1,81-2),
many of these forms based on nouns occur attributive to
other nouns. While they literally mean 'having to do with
[base]', they are usually translated by the same word as the
base. The following examples occur as modifiers to other
nouns:
buruh worker : (sengketa) perburuhan labour (dispute)
ekonomi economy : (masalah) perekonomian economic
(matter)
film movie : (dunia) perfilman movie (world)
hotel hotel : (bidang) perhotelan hotel (sector)
industri industry : (daerah) perindustrian industrial
(region)
kabar news : (media) perkabaran news (media)
kayu timber : (buruh) perkayuan timber (worker)
rumah house : (kompleks) perumahan housing
(complex)1.99 Some per-...-an nouns with noun bases indicate 'a
collection of [base]' or 'the place where a large number of
[base] are found':
air water : perairan waters
alat instrument : peralatan equipment
bukit hill : perbukitan hilly region
gelang bracelet : pergelangan ankle/wrist
istilah term : peristilahan terminology
pustaka book (archaic) : perpustakaan library
1.100 Some per-...-an nouns mean both 'affairs to do with
[base]' (see 1.98) and 'place where a large number of [base]
are found/collection of [base]' (1.99):
ikan fish : perikanan fishery affairs; fishery
kebun garden : perkebunan horticulture; plantation
kota town : perkotaan urban affairs; urban area
sawah rice field : persawahan rice cultivation; cluster of
rice fields
ternak livestock : peternakan animal husbandry; animal
farm
toko shop : pertokoan shopping matters; shopping area
The different meanings are made clear in context:
Dia ingin mendapat pekerjaan di peternakan ayam.
She wants to get a job on a chicken farm.
Dia ingin mendapat pekerjaan di bidang peternakan.
She wants to get a job in animal husbandry.
Ayahnya mengurus perkebunan teh.
Her father manages a tea plantation.
Ayahnya pejabat di jawatan perkebunan.
Her father is an official in the horticulture office.
1.101 Some per-...-an nouns with noun bases have a
meaning the same as or very similar to that of the base:
batas limit; border : perbatasan border
debat debate : perdebatan debate
masalah matter, problem : permasalahan matter,
problem
muka face; surface : permukaan surface
serikat union : perserikatan union
soal matter, problem : persoalan matter, problemsyarat condition, regulation : persyaratan regulations
1.102 With cardinal numbers per-...-an forms nouns
referring to road intersections. Only the following occur:
tiga three : pertigaan three-way intersection
empat four : perempatan cross-roads
lima five : perlimaan five-way intersection
Circumfix pe-...-an1.103 The number of nouns with this affix is limited. It
occurs unpredictably with some bases instead of per-*..-an.
(In contexts where the r of per- is regularly lost, as in
peternakan 'animal farm' (see 1.4), per-...-an is recognised as
occurring.) Most pe-...-an nouns are based on nouns and
indicate 'the place where a large number of [base] occur'. A
few also mean 'affairs to do with [base]'. Several have bases
which are not nouns:
dalam inside : pedalaman interior, inland
desa village : pedesaan rural; rural area
gunung mountain : pegunungan mountain range
jagal butcher : pejagalan abattoir
bertualang undertake adventure : petualangan adventure
menggadaikan pawn : pegadaian pawn shop
1.104 With some bases both per-...-an and pe-...-an occur,
with the same meaning. Some speakers use only one or the
other:
bermukim reside : permukiman, pemukiman settlement
dupa incense : perdupaan, pedupaan censer, incense
burner
kubur grave : perkuburan, pekuburan cemetery
sawah rice field : persawahan, pesawahan rice
cultivation; cluster of rice fields
Suffixes -wan, -wati and -man1.105 The suffix -wan occurs with bases, most of which are
nouns, to indicate a person who is regularly associated with
[base].
harta wealth, property : hartawan wealthy person
ilmu science : ilmuwan scientist
olahraga sport : olahragawan sportsman/womanrohani spiritual : rohaniwan clergyman
sastra literature : sastrawan man of letters
sejarah history : sejara(h)wan historian
warta news : wartawan journalist
1.106 Suffixes -wan and -wati, both borrowed from
Sanskrit, are the only affixes in the language which make a
gender distinction (see also 1.42). The form -wan refers to
both male and female unless it is contrasted with -wati, which
is specifically feminine:
karya work : karyawati female worker
seni art : seniwati female artist
sukarela voluntary : sukarelawati female volunteer
wisuda graduation : wisudawati graduating female
1.107 The suffix -man derives one noun:
seni art : seniman artist
Suffixes -anda, -nda1.108 These are added to a number of pronouns and kin
terms to form honorifics, that is, forms of address which show
respect. Suffix -anda is added to bases ending in a consonant
and -nda to bases ending in a vowel. In most cases a base
loses final k, resulting in a final vowel, which is then followed
by -nda:
anak : anakanda child
kakak : kakanda older sibling
ayah : ayahanda father
nenek : nenenda grandmother
ibu : ibunda mother
adik : adinda younger sibling
The word ayunda 'older sister (honorific) is a borrowing
from Javanese and has no base in Indonesian.
1Prefix ke-1.109 This is added to a few bases to form nouns:
hendak want : kehendak desire
kasih love : kekasih beloved
rangka framework, skeleton : kerangka skeleton
tua old : ketua chairmanPrefix ter-1*110 This prefix occurs with a small group of nouns used
in legal proceedings, such as terdakwa 'accused person':
Satu demi satu para terdakwa dijatuhi hukuman
penjara.
One by one the accused were sentenced to jail.
These forms also occur as verbs (see 1.265); as nouns the
following occur:
tergugat the accused
terhukum person who has been sentenced
terpidana convicted person
tersangka the suspect
tertuduh the accused
Prefix pra-1.111 Prefix pra- 'pre-' is a borrowing from Sanskrit:
prasejarah prehistory (sejarah history)
prasangka prejudice (sangka supposition)
prakata foreword (kata word)
prasyarat precondition (syarat condition)
Comparison of noun-forming affixes1.112 While generalisations can be made about the
functions of all noun-forming affixes, there are always
exceptions, words which can only be placed in a category with
difficulty or not at all. Many irregularities and minor
functions of affixes are not considered in the above sections.
1.113 Further, there is not always a clear-cut distinction
between the functions of two affixes. The result is that a
particular base might take two affixes with little or no
difference in meaning. Thus, while peN- usually occurs with
verb bases (1.45) and -wan with noun bases (1.105), there are
a few bases which allow both affixes to occur, with the same
meaning:
pirsa : pemirsa, pirsawan television viewer
usaha : pengusaha, usahawan business person1.114 In some cases a word is derived with one of two
affixes, the choice being unpredictable for a particular base,
as seen from the following pair:
menolong help : pertolongan help, assistance
membantu help : bantuan help, assistance
1.115 Sometimes the difference in meaning between two
derived forms depends on whether the form relates directly to
the meaning of the base or to the meaning of another derived
form. This is the case with the pair ke-...-an and peN-...-an.
The meaning of the former relates immediately to the
meaning of the adjective base (see 1.73), while the meaning
of the latter relates to the meaning of the corresponding
transitive verb (1.87). Thus:
bersih clean : kebersihan cleanliness; membersihkan
make clean : pembersihan (act of) cleansing
bebas free : kebebasan freedom; membebaskan release,
liberate : pembebasan (act of) liberating
1.116 Affixes -an and peN-...-an frequently have the same
verbal base. In such cases the meaning of -an usually relates
to the object of the action, (apa yang di-[base] - see 1.59),
while peN-...-an relates to the action itself (see 1.187):
menerjemahkan translate : terjemahan translation;
penerjemahan act of translating
menabung save : tabungan savings (money which is
saved); penabungan act of saving (the saving of
money)
menulis write : tulisan writing (something which is
written); penulisan writing (the act of writing
something)
memilih choose : pilihan choice, selection (something
chosen or selected); pemilihan act of choosing,
selecting
Terjemahan ini tepat sekali.
This translation is very accurate.
Penerjemahan buku itu dilakukan tahun lalu.
The translation/translating of that book was undertaken last
year.","[69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]"
"Complements with sebagai3.82 While similar to an adjunct, a prepositional phrase
with sebagai is essential to the meaning of the clause, which is
therefore incomplete without it. As such these constructions
are complements, which link directly to either the subject or
object of the clause.
A complement with sebagai can occur with some intransitive
verbs to indicate what role or function the subject has:
Dia bekerja di sana sebagai tukang kayu.
He works there as a carpenter.
Bahasa Indonesia berfungsi sebagai alat pemersatu
bangsa.
Indonesian functions as the national unifier.
The complement can occur with some transitive verbs and
describes the role of the patient or what the patient's role is
thought to be. The patient can be object of an active clause
or subject of a passive clause:
Harian Kompas memandang keputusan pemerintah
sebagai langkah mundur.
The daily Kompas regards the government decision as a
backward step.
Panitia memilih Djunawi sebagai ketua sidang pleno.
The committee chose Djunawi as the president of the
general session.
Mereka dicap sebagai bandit.
They were branded as bandits.
Kacong dianggap polisi sebagai penjahat.
Kacong was considered by the police to be a criminal.
Complements of adjective clauses3.83 There are two types of verbal complement in
adjectival clauses. In one type the subject of the main clause
is also actor of the complement verb, discussed in 3.84. In
the other the subject of the main clause stands as patient of
the complement verb, discussed in 3.85.
3.84 A limited number of adjectives can take an active
verb as a complement. The adjective then indicates the
manner in which the subject performs the action. In theseconstructions the adjective is the predicate centre and can be
negated; it does not function as an adverb within a verbal
clause. The following verb usually occurs as a 'to-infinitive*
verb in the English translation. Adjectives which can take
such a complement include pandai 'clever, capable'
(translated in this construction as 'able, capable'), berani
'brave' (translated in this construction as 'dare'), and gembira
'delighted':
Ratna pandai berenang.
Ratna is able to swim.
Dia tidak berani membantah pendapat guru.
He wouldn't dare contradict the teacher's opinion.
Saya gembira mendengar berita itu.
I was delighted to hear the news.
Other adjectives able to take such complements include:
takut afraid
malu embarrassed
senang happy
bangga proud
segan reluctant
cenderung inclined
3.85 A limited number of adjectives can take a verbal
complement in which the verb is passive and the adjective
describes the way in which the subject noun undergoes the
action. Adjectives occurring in this construction include
sukar 'difficult', sulit 'difficult' and mudah 'easy'. Untuk
optionally begins the complement:
Tulisan saudara sulit (untuk) dibaca.
Your writing is hard to read.
Kata-kata baru ini sukar (untuk) saya ingat.
These new words are hard for me to remember.
Jawabannya tidak mudah dimengerti.
His answer wasn't easy to understand.
Other adjectives taking such complements include:
menarik interesting
enak pleasant
gampang easy
patut appropriate
baik good
In Indonesian a verb must be passive if the subject noun
identifies its patient. This is also the case where the verb
occurs at a lower level, as in the above constructions. Thus, inthe first example above tulisan 'writing stands as patient of
the verb 'read'; the verb must therefore be in its passive form
dibaca. (This rule does not apply in English, where the verb
is usually active, as in the above examples.) This rule also
applies in relative clauses, and is further discussed in relation
to such constructions (see 3.99).
1These constructions can be transformed into the constructions
discussed in sections 3.10-11.
The modifying adverbs terlalu and cukup are possible, in
which case many more adjectives can occur than those given
above. Untuk obligatorily introduces the complement:
Sepatu ini terlalu mahal untuk kami beli.
These shoes are too expensive for us to buy.
Papaya ini sudah cukup masak untuk dimakan.
This papaw is already ripe enough to eat.
DERIVED CLAUSES3.86 Derived clauses are constructions which are best
described with reference to changes undergone by basic
clauses. Some derived clauses are independent, that is, they
can occur alone as a sentence. These are topic-comment
clauses (see 3.87), identifying clauses (see 3.92) and direct
quote clauses (see 3.95). Others are dependent, that is, they
cannot occur alone as a sentence. These include relative
clauses (see 3.97), bahwa clauses (see 3.108), untuk clauses
(see 3.113), supaya/agar clauses (see 3.119), and
nominalised clauses (see 3.130).
Topic-comment clauses3.87 In addition to the nuclear phrases occurring in basic
clauses (see 3.2), a topic-comment clause contains an extra
nuclear component, the topic. Topic-comment clauses are
used to highlight a particular noun phrase. This phrase is
taken from the basic clause and placed before it, becoming
the topic. The rest of the clause is then a comment on the
topic. The place from which the topic is taken is marked by
-nya. There are two types of topic-comment clause, thosewhose topic is based on a possessor, called here possessor
topic-comment clauses, and those whose topic is based on an
object, called here object topic-comment clauses.
Possessor topic-comment clauses3.88 This construction is based on a clause whose subject
noun phrase contains a possessor. The possessor is placed
before the clause, becoming the topic. Its place in the subject
is marked by -nya. This process is illustrated by the
following example, the basic clause being given first, then the
topic comment clause:
Nama sopir itu Pak Ali.
The name of that driver is Mr Ali.
Sopir itu namanya Pak Ali.
Concerning that driver, his name is Mr Ali.
In the basic clause above the subject is nama sopir itu 'the
name of that driver'. The possessor, sopir itu 'that driver',
becomes the topic, its place being marked by -nya. Thus in
the topic-comment clause the topic is sopir itu 'that driver'
and the comment is namanya Pak Ali 'his name is Mr Ali'.
A topic-comment clause has the force of 'as for [topic], ...' or
'concerning [topic], ...', as in the above example. Such a
construction is, however, frequently unnatural in English,
although used in the above example to convey the force of
this construction. The emphasis on the topic is accompanied
by a rise in pitch (rising intonation). A slight pause may also
occur after the topic; in writing a comma can but need not
follow the topic. The translations of the following examples
do not necessarily convey the force of the Indonesian
construction:
Jakarta wajahnya sudah mulai berubah.
The face of Jakarta has begun to change.
' Para pegawai gajinya tidak akan naik.
The salary of the employees will not rise.
Teman saya, anaknya tiga.
My friend, he has three children.
Mahasiswa itu, rambutnya tidak pernah disisir.
That student, his hair is never combed.","[302, 303, 304, 305, 306]"
"With ketinggalan 'be left behind' a person can be subject only
if he or she is the 'thing' left behind:
Saya ketinggalan bis.
I missed the bus. (literally: I was left behind by the bus.)
1.283 Two ke-...-an verbs are not adversative. These are
kelihatan 'can be seen, visible; looks, seems' and kedengaran
'can be heard, audible; sounds, seems':
Rumahnya tidak kelihatan dari sini.
His house can't be seen from here.
Musik itu kedengaran dari jalan.
The music can be heard from the road.
Meaning 'can be seen/heard' these verbs function like passive
verbs and can take an agent. If the agent is a pronoun
occurrence of oleh 'by' is obligatory (see 3.32):
Musik itu kedengaran olehku.
I could hear the music.
These verbs can have a verbal compliment (see example in
3.76).
If the verb means 'seems (looks/sounds)' it cannot take an
agent (being intransitive in this function); it can have an
adjectival complement (see 3.69) and can take -nya:
Supomo kelihatan(nya) sakit.
Supomo looks sick.
1.284 Acting like kelihatan are the affixless verbs nampak
and tampak 'can be seen, visible' (with -nya these mean
'seems, looks' and function as sentence adjuncts - see 4.107):
Umi tampak/nampak olehku duduk dengan Fatimah dan
Salamah.
I could see Umi sitting with Fatimah and Salamah.
Verbs with prefix ke-1.285 There are only a few verbs occurring with prefix ke.
The prefix is a borrowing from Javanese and all these verbs
are regarded as non-standard to some degree by manypeople. Almost all ke- verbs correspond to ter- accidental
verbs. A very few, including the first two listed below,
correspond to other forms. More standard forms having the
same meaning as ke- verbs are given in parentheses for the
following examples:
ketemu (bertemu) meet
ketimbang (dibandingkan dengan) compared with
ketawa (tertawa) laugh
kesohor (tersohor) famous
ketipu (tertipu) tricked
ketabrak (tertabrak) collided with
kesasar (tersasar) lost, astray
kepergok (tepergok) caught red handed
14Chaer (1988: 303) advises against the use of forms like ketipu
'tricked' and ketabrak 'collided with', advising that ter- forms,
such as tertipu and tertabrak, be used instead2 PHRASES2.1
This chapter describes phrases and other
constructions which combine to form clauses (clauses are
described in Chapter Three). A phrase is a group of words
which is grammatically equivalent to a single word, being able
to occur in the same places as that word. The phrase contains
a word of the class to which it is equivalent. This word is the
head or head word of the phrase, the rest of the phrase being
built around it. The phrase type is identified by the word
class of its head. Thus a noun phrase contains a noun, an
adjective phrase contains an adjective, and so on.
NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES2.2
A noun phrase is a sequence of words which
functions in the same way as a noun; that is, it occurs in the
same positions in a clause as a single noun. A noun phrase
always contains a noun as its head. Nouns are discussed in
section 2.3. The other major components of noun phrases
are discussed in sections 2.5 to 2.60. Some other components
of noun phrases are described elsewhere. A noun occurring
alone can be regarded as a (minimal) noun phrase (see 2.4).","[152, 153, 154, 155]"
"""Diundang teman lama' , sahut Febrian dengan
perasaan bersalah*
""Are [you] dining out?"" ...
""[I]'ve been invited by an old friend"", replied Febrian with
a feeling of guilt.
9If two clauses are in coordination and have the same subject
then the subject of the second clause can be ellipted:
Mereka sudah lama kawin, tetapi belum punya anak.
They have been married a long time but [they] don't yet
have any children.
Further examples, with a variety of coordinators, are given in
section 4.64.
The subject of a subordinate clause can be omitted whether it
precedes or follows the main clause:
Ali tidak pergi ke sekolah karena sakit
Karena sakit Ali tidak pergi ke sekolah.
Because [he] was sick Ali didn't go to school.
If the subordinate clause occurs first it can retain the subject.
In this case the noun can be replaced by a pronoun in the
main clause. However, the subject cannot be omitted entirely
from the main clause:
Karena Ali sakit, dia tidak pergi ke sekolah.
Because Ali was sick he didn't go to school.
Ellipsis of the subject after supaya/agar when acting as a
complement is discussed in section 3.122. The subject can
also be ellipted if supaya introduces a subordinate clause (see
4.74):
Dia pergi ke perpustakaan supaya (dia) dapat membaca
buku.
He went to the library so that [he] could read a book.
Ellipsis of subject nouns referring to non-humans4.113 When a noun referring to a human is understood
from context it is usually represented by a pronoun, as
repetition of the noun would sound awkward. In the case of a
noun referring to anything other than a human there is nocorresponding pronoun in many positions in the sentence
(see 2.74). In such cases ellipsis is the only alternative to
stylistically awkward repetion of the noun. In the following
example nira 'palm juice is omitted from the second
sentence:
Nira tidak bisa dibiarkan lama* Kalau tidak segera
dimasak akan cepat jadi rusak.
Palm juice cannot be left long. If [it] is not boiled at once
[it] will quickly spoil.
1In section 3.39 is an example where, after initial mention,
kaki ayam 'the chicken leg' is ellipted in three following
clauses.
Retention of parts of the noun phrase in ellipsis4.114 If a noun is omitted a relative clause occurring
within the noun phrase can be retained. This is then
nominalised, as discussed in section 3.131. A number, along
with a classifier or measure noun, can also be retained. Other
components of the noun phrase, such as adjectives, attributive
nouns and possessives, cannot occur if the head noun is
omitted. In the following example the quantifier measure
noun segelas 'a glass (of something)' is retained in the second
sentence while the head noun susu 'milk' is ellipted. In the
third sentence the subject is a nominalised relative clause
yang lain 'the other', gelas (susu) being ellipted:
Dia datang membawa susu dua gelas. Segelas
diletakkannya di atas meja. Yang lain dibawanya
padaku.
She came carrying two glasses of milk. She put one glass
on the table. The other she brought to me.
All nominalised relative clauses result from ellipsis of the
head of the noun phrase, examples being given in sections
3.131-5.
Ellipsis of words other than the subject4.115 If an action or state has been mentioned it need not
be repeated in the following clause. Instead, the following
clause may contain just the subject and any words which donot occur in the preceding clause or contrast with what has
been said:
Saya sudah makan tapi mereka belum.
I've eaten but they haven't yet.
Majikannya tidak tahu ke mana dia pindah. Temantemannya juga tidak tahu.
Her employer didn't know where she had moved to. Her
friends didn't know either.
Multiple ellipsis4.116 It is not uncommon for ellipsis both of subject and
other redundant components of a clause to occur together.
The following sentence repeats an example given in section
4.95, with ellipted components of the correlative subordinate
clauses presented in square brackets:
Entah [gagasannya] disetujui entah [gagasannya] tidak
[disetujui], dia tetap akan mengusulkan gagasannya.
Whether it is agreed to or not he will continue to propose
his idea.
Ellipsis of possessives4.117 Possessive pronouns can be ellipted. This is
especially common in the case of inalienable possession, such
as referring to body parts, when it is obvious who the
possessor is:
Dia mengulurkan tangan kepadaku.
He held out [his] hand to me.
Mereka sedang menggosok gigi.
They are cleaning [their] teeth.
Ellipsis in responses4.118 In conversation ellipsis frequently occurs in one
person's response to what another says.
In response to a question words occurring in the question are
usually not repeated:
Q: Siapa nama saudara? A: Jim.
What's your name?
Jim.
Q: Berapa harganya?
A: Tiga ribu.
How much is it?
Three thousand.","[393, 394, 395, 396]"

Transitive verbs with suffix -kan1.189 All verbs with suffix -kan are transitive with the
exception of merupakan (see 3.25). A number of different
functions of -kan can be identified, although it is also
possible to regard it as having two basic functions, that of
marking the object as patient and that of marking the object
as beneficiary. The different roles of participants in the
action, such as patient and beneficiary, are discussed in
section 3.17.
With all non-benefactive verbs -kan marks the object as the
patient of the action, that is, the thing which is manipulated,
acted on or moved by the action. With some verbs this
participant can also be regarded as the instrument (see 1.205).
1.190 With many verb bases -kan has no other function
than identifying the object as the patient of the action. Like
ber- and meN- with intransitive verb bases it is simply
required to produce a well-formed verb. Verbs in this group
include:
melemparkan throw
meninggalkan leave
mengerjakan do, work
menguraikan analyse
merundingkan discuss
memikirkan think about
menyebutkan mention
melakukan do, carry out
membutuhkan need
melaksanakan carry out
menerangkan explain
menghamburkan scatter
menerapkan apply
mengharapkan hope
membicarakan discuss
mengenakan put on
menyiarkan broadcast
menerjemahkan translate
menghiraukan pay attention to
menyumbangkan contribute
mengadakan do, carry out
membandingkan compare
menganjurkan urge, suggestWith some bases, including some listed above, -kan is
optional, as discussed in section 1.210. With some verbs -kan
can be replaced by suffix -i; in this case the object is the
recipient or location rather than the patient (see 1.212).
Causative -kan1.191 With many verbs -kan has a causative function. The
base may be an adjective, noun or verb.
1.192 If the base is an adjective the object is caused to have
the quality or characteristic specified by the base. Thus
membersihkan means 'cause object to be clean (bersih)':
Kamar ini sudah bersih.
This room is clean.
Siti sudah membersihkan kamar ini.
Siti has cleaned this room.
This form is very productive and can be based on most
adjectives:
mengamankan pacify, render safe (aman peaceful, safe)
membersihkan clean (bersih clean)
melebarkan widen (lebar wide)
mengeringkan dry (kering dry)
membebaskan set free, release (bebas free)
mematikan extinguish (mati dead)
melembutkan soften (lembut soft)
A few adjectives do not form bases for such verbs. Thus
indah 'beautiful' does not form the base of such a verb;
mengindahkan 'pay attention to' has an unrelated verbal base.
1.193 With a few verbs the meaning is not predictable from
the meaning of the adjective base:
- membenarkan correct; confirm; approve (benar right,
correct)
memberatkan make things difficult for (berat heavy)
menyulitkan cause difficulty for (sulit difficult)
menggelapkan embezzle (gelap dark)
meremehkan belittle; underestimate (remeh of no
importance)
memuliakan honour deeply (mulia noble)1.194 One subtype of causatives are based on adjectives
indicating emotions and attitudes. These verbs indicate that
the subject causes the object to experience the emotion or
attitude expressed by the base. When the object is understood
as applying to everyone in general it is typically omitted:
Film itu membosankan.
That movie is boring.
Pidatonya mengecewakan.
His speech was disappointing.
Madonna mengejutkan.
Madonna is startling.
Such verbs can function as ordinary transitives when the
action applies to a particular object:
Film-film seperti itu membosankan saya.
Movies like that bore me.
Pidatonya mengecewakan para pemilih.
His speech disappointed the voters.
Madonna mengejutkan publik lagi.
Madonna has startled the public again.
When there is no object these verbs function like adjectives
and are usually translated by adjectives, as in the above
examples. Like adjectives they can take modifying adverbs,
such as kian 'increasingly' and sangat 'very (see 2.100):
Kondisinya kian memprihatinkan.
His condition is causing increasing concern.
Kabar itu sangat menyedihkan.
The news was very saddening.
1Other verbs in this group include the following. Typical
translations with and without an object are given:
memuaskan satisfy / satisfying
memalukan embarrass / embarrassing
mengejutkan startle / startling
menyenangkan please / pleasing
meyakinkan convince / convincing
menakutkan frighten / frightening
menyedihkan sadden / saddening
mencemaskan make apprehensive / cause apprehension
mengagumkan fill with admiration / admirableWith these verbs a phrase beginning with untuk or bagi (see
2.105) may occur instead of an object. In this case the verb
behaves like an adjective and is translated as such:
Kelakuannya memalukan ibunya.
His behaviour embarrassed his mother.
Kelakuannya memalukan bagi ibunya.
His behaviour was embarrassing for his mother.
1.195 The verb mengherankan 'amazing frequently
occurs with tidak, meaning 'no wonder, it's not surprising':
Tidak mengherankan perusahaan itu terus berkembang
dengan pesatnya.
It's not surprising that company continues to grow quickly.
11.196 A number of verbs whose bases do not indicate
emotions or attitudes, including some with noun bases,
function in the same way as the emotive verbs and can be
grouped with them, such as:
merugikan inflict a loss on, damage / damaging, harmful
(rugi suffer a loss)
menghebohkan cause a sensation, cause an uproar /
sensational (heboh commotion, uproar)
mengesankan impress / impressive (kesan impression)
merepotkan cause difficulty for / causing difficulty, being
a nuisance (repot busy, going to trouble)
Keputusan itu sangat merepotkan.
The decision caused a great deal of difficulty.
1.197 Some of the verbs in this group can also indicate that
the subject undergoes the emotion expressed by the base.
Thus, as well as meaning 'cause apprehension', mencemaskan
can mean 'feel apprehension'. As well as meaning 'cause to be
proud', membanggakan can mean 'be proud of, and
mengkhawatirkan can mean 'worry about' as well as meaning
'cause worry':
Banyak pengamat mencemaskan bahwa Kim akan
gagal.
Many observers are apprehensive that Kim will fail.
Pak Hasrun membanggakan anaknya.
Mr Hasrun is proud of his son.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100]"
"Pemilik toko dibunuh.
The shop keeper was killed (by someone).
Frequently the relationship is made clear by use of oleh 'by'
before an actor attributive and by a preposition, usually
terhadap 'of, toward', before a patient attributive:
pembunuhan oleh pemilik toko
the killing by the shop keeper
pembunuhan terhadap pemilik toko
the killing of the shop owner (by someone)
Attributives relating to the head noun as actor and patient can
occur together, in which case the second requires a
preposition. Their relative ordering is free:
penuduhan lurah oleh bupati
the accusation of the village head by the bupati
penuduhan lurah terhadap bupati
the village head's accusation of the bupati
The first phrase above relates to Lurah dituduh oleh bupati
'The village head was accused by the bupati\ and the second
relates to Lurah menuduh bupati 'The village head accused
the bupati\
A preposition may occur before each of the attributives:
pemukulan terhadap pengemudi sepeda motor oleh
seorang polisi
the beating of a motor cyclist by a policeman
The following examples illustrate occurrence of attributive
nouns with action nouns which do not have affix peN-.~-an:
kecaman keras negara-negara itu terhadap Iran
the strong criticism by those countries of Iran
serangan oleh seorang gerilya
an attack by a guerrilla
eksploitasi negara-negara kaya terhadap negara-negara
miskin
exploitation by wealthy countries of poor countries
Several other prepositions can replace terhadap as marker of
the patient attributive, of which atas is the most frequent.
Dari also occurs:pemboman atas kota itu
the bombing of that city
pengangkutan olehnya dari barang ini
the transporting by him of these goods
Bahwa and supaya/agar complements in noun phrases2.54 Some nouns can take a complement introduced by
bahwa 'that (see 3.108) or supaya/agar '(so) that' (see
3.119):
laporan-laporan bahwa kegiatan tersebut telah berhenti
reports that those activities have ceased
seruan agar perdamaian tercipta
an appeal that peace be achieved
1Such complements occur with nouns which correspond to
verbs which can take the same complements. Thus the phrase
laporan bahwa..* 'the report that...' is based on (Dia)
melaporkan bahwa... '(He) reported that../; the phrase
seruan agar ... 'an appeal (so) that ...' is based on (Dia)
berseru agar ... '(He) appealed that...'.
Word order within the noun phrase2.55 This discussion is restricted to the relative ordering
of certain constituents of the noun phrase which occur after
the head noun: modifying nouns, adjectives, possessors,
relative clauses, attributive nouns- and demonstratives.
2.56 A modifying noun directly follows the head,
preceding all other post-head elements including adjectives
and possessors:
toko buku besar
a big book shop
guru bahasa saya
my language teacher
2.57 A possessor follows an adjective:
sikap tegas bapak
father's firm attitude
galangan kapal terbesar Korea Selatan
South Korea's largest shipyard2*58 Attributive nouns in action noun phrases also follow
adjectives:
kecaman keras negara-negara itu terhadap Iran
the harsh criticism of Iran by those countries
2.59 Relative clauses follow modifying nouns, adjectives
and possessors:
sandiwara baru Pak Djoko yang dipentaskan tadi
malam
Mr Djoko's new play which was staged last night
An adjective preceded by yang is a relative clause (see 3.98).
In this case it follows a possessor, whereas without yang it
precedes the possessor, as in 2.57:
sikap bapak yang tegas
father's firm attitude
2.60 The demonstratives follow all other constituents of
the phrase. In the following example the demonstrative
follows an adjective and possessor:
baju merah saya ini
this red shirt of mine
The presence of a demonstrative thus marks the end of a
noun phrase. The first construction below is a noun phrase
ending in itu, the second is a clause in which the subject noun
phrase ends in itu and is followed by an adjective predicate,
the third construction is also a clause in which the subject is
itu (see 2.65) and the predicate is a noun phrase:
rumah besar itu
that big house
Rumah itu besar.
That house is big.
Itu rumah besar.
That is a big house.
Structural ambiguity may occur if there is more than one
noun preceding a demonstrative. In the following phrase
nelayan 'fisherman' is either a modifying noun describing
what sort of house is being referred to, in which case ini refers
to the head word rumah 'house' (because a modifying nouncannot usually be the head of a phrase - see 231 if), or it is a
possessor, specifying the owner of the house, in which case ini
refers to nelayan:
rumah nelayan ini
this fisherman's house
or the house of this fisherman
In the following example itu may refer to the head word,
tuduhan itu 'those charges', or to the attributive, Robert itu
'that (person) Robert' (demonstratives can follow proper
nouns - see 2.7):
tuduhan terhadap Robert itu
those charges against Robert
or the charges against that (person) Robert
Ambiguity may result when a demonstrative follows a relative
clause ending in a noun; the demonstrative may refer to the
head word or it may be part of the noun phrase within the
relative clause, referring to the final noun of the relative
clause. Thus the following example may be interpreted as
containing anak ... itu 'that child' or ... sepeda itu 'that
bicycle':
Anak yang naik sepeda itu tinggal dekat saya*
That child riding a bike lives near me.
or The child riding that bike lives near me.
Although it is widely regarded as unacceptable, itu sometimes
occurs before a relative clause in journalistic style, especially
if the relative clause is long. Most people would place itu at
the end of the subject noun phrase, after aktivis, in the
following sentence:
Kapal carteran itu, yang mengangkut para pelajar dan
kaum aktivis, kembali menuju Darwin.
The charter boat, which was transporting the students and
activists, turned back to Darwin.
Noun phrases in apposition2.61 When two noun phrases occur one after the other
and refer to the same person or thing they are in apposition.
The second noun phrase gives further information about thefirst, and is called the defining appositional phrase. The two
phrases are usually separated in writing by a comma and in
speech by a slight pause between them. In the first example
below Ola and suaminya 'her husband' are two noun phrases
referring to the same person; the second gives information
about the first:
Dia menantikan Ola, suaminya.
She awaited Ola, her husband.
Ini namanya Monas, Monumen Nasional.
This is called Monas, the National Monument.
Pertunjukan lain adalah ketoprak, sandiwara tradisional
dengan cerita dari sejarah dan dongeng-dongeng.
Another show is the ketoprak, a traditional play with stories
from history and legend.
The defining appositional phrase can itself be followed by a
defining phrase. In the following example the defining
phrase gives information about Pak Trimo. The defining
phrase itself is followed by a defining phrase giving
information about Banyusumurup:
Ini Pak Trimo, seorang penduduk di Banyusumurup,
sebuah desa di lereng Gunung Kidul.
This is Mr Trimo, a resident of Banyusumurup, a village
on the slope of Mount Kidul.
The defining noun phrase can sometimes occur before the
main phrase. In this case a comma is not placed between the
two in writing:
Suaminya Ola masih belum pulang.
Her husband Ola still hadn't returned home.
Petenis Amerika Agassi maju ke perempat final.
The American tennis player Agassi advanced to the quarter
final.
2.62 The apposition can be made explicit by occurrence
of ya'itu or yakni 'that is' before the defining noun phrase:
Camat wilayah itu, yakni Pak Sitepu, berkerabat dengan
saya.
The district camat, that is Mr Sitepu, was a relative of mine.
Di sebelah barat Parangtritis terdapat sebuah tempat
wisata lagi, ya'itu Pantai Samas.","[181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186]"

"2.112 Cardinal numbers can be preceded by a modifier,
such as lebih dari more than':
Lebih dari sepuluh orang tewas dalam kecelakaan itu.
More than ten people died in the accident.
fModifiers of cardinal numbers include:
kira-kira, sekitar, kurang lebih about, more or less
hampir almost
sampai up to
genap fully
lebih dari more than
kurang dari less than
The last two modifiers in the above list can be negated:
Tidak kurang dari satu juta orang menjadi pengecer
Amway.
No less than one million people have become Amway
retailers.
The modifier lebih can follow the number:
Akuarium itu dapat menampung lima ribu lebih
binatang laut.
The aquarium can hold more than five thousand sea
creatures.
Indefinite numbers2.113 Indefinite numbers include the following:
semua all
segala all
seluruh all of, whole of; all
segenap all
seantero the whole (of an area)
sebagian part of
tiap, setiap, tiap-tiap each, every
banyak many (with count nouns); a lot, much (with noncount nouns)
beberapa several
sedikit a little, few
bermacam-macam various, all sorts of
berbagai, pelbagai various
sejumlah a number ofkebanyakan most
salah satu, salah seorang one of
masing-masing each
aneka various, all sorts of
sembarang any (kind of), no particular
Some indefinite numbers, including banyak and sedikit, can
take a modifying adverb (see 2.100):
banyak sekali orang very many people
terlalu sedikit gula too little sugar
Banyak is preceded by lebih 'more' before a noun where in
English 'more' directly preceded the noun:
lebih banyak uang more money
Several indefinite numbers can be negated by tidak, including
semua, seluruh, setiap, banyak, sedikit:
Tidak banyak orang yang senang pada dia.
Not many people like him.
Tidak semua orang bisa mengontrol marah seperti itu.
Not all people can control anger in that way.
Sembarang differs from other indefinite numbers in that it is
negated by bukan:
Bukan sembarang orang diundang.
Not just any old person was invited.
Several indefinite numbers can be pronominalised (see 2.95).
2.114 The indefinite number suatu 'a, one is similar in
function to sebuah (see 2.21). This usually occurs with
abstract nouns:
suatu sistem/ide yang bagus/penyelidikan/pertemuan
a system/good idea/investigation/meeting
1While suatu is sometimes used with concrete objects, (se)buah
is sometimes used with abstract things; there is thus some
overlap:
sebuah/suatu pondok/dialek/propinsi/kesimpulan
a hut/dialect/province/conclusionHowever, unlike classifiers, suatu is inherently singular.
2.115 The indefinite number masing-masing deserves
some comment. It occurs before a noun - but after a
pronoun (see 2.80) - with a similar meaning to tiap 'each , but
emphasises the separateness of each of the people or things
involved:
Masing-masing transmigran menerima sebidang tanah.
Each transmigrant received a plot of land.
1It also occurs after a noun, where the separateness of each of
the people or things referred to is caused by its correlation
separately with someone or something mentioned elsewhere.
In this case it could also be regarded as following a possessive
pronoun with the pronoun deleted:
Mereka pulang ke rumah masing-masing.
They each returned to their own home.
Para sandera menelpon keluarga masing-masing.
Each of the hostages telephoned his (own) family.
Masing-masing can occur as an indefinite pronoun (see
2.96).
2.116 A special indefinite number is para. Used only with
humans, para marks the noun as plural and referring to a
particular group:
Jenaza para korban dibawa ke rumah sakit.
The bodies of the victims were taken to the hospital.
Beginilah terungkapkan cinta dan kesetiaan terhadap
para leluhur.
In this way can be expressed love and faithfulness to the
ancestors.
Para is used only with nouns indicating people having some
characteristic in common, such as para guru 'the teachers',
para nelayan 'the fishermen'. It does not occur with generic
nouns such as orang 'person', anak 'child', manusia 'human'.
2.117 While satu-satunya 'the only' is not specifically
indefinite it can be grouped with indefinite numbers:
Satu-satunya jembatan dari desa itu sudah rusak.","[213, 214, 215, 216]"
"3.93 Many Indonesians do not allow question words
siapa 'who' and apa 'what' to be the subject of a basic passive
clause. Instead they must occur in identifying constructions.
This is discussed in section 4.16.
3.94 The order of subject and predicate cannot be
reversed in an identifying clause; reversal of order produces a
basic clause in which the subject is a nominalised relative
clause (see 3.131-2). In each of the pairs of constructions
below the first is an identifying clause, which has rising
intonation on the predicate, while the second is a basic clause,
with normal intonation pattern:
Pakaian yang saya beli.
It was clothes that I bought.
Yang saya beli pakaian.
What I bought was clothes.
Pak Hasjim(lah) yang mendirikan sekolah itu.
It was Mr Hasjim who founded that school.
Yang mendirikan sekolah itu (adalah) Pak Hasjim.
The one who founded that school was Mr Hasjim.
Direct quote clauses3.95 Some verbs report what someone said. The object of
such verbs, or the complement if they are intransitive (see
3.61), is a direct quote, sometimes called direct speech. In
writing this is placed within quotation marks and is usually
preceded by a comma:
Dia berkata, ""Terima kasih"".
He said, ""Thank you"".
Dewi menjawab, ""Betul"".
Dewi replied, ""That is correct"".
These clauses are here called direct quote clauses. A person's
words can also be indirectly quoted, as discussed in section
3.111.
3.96 As well as basic direct quote clauses there are derived
direct quote clauses. In these the direct speech is placed first
in the clause for emphasis. The subject and verb of the basic
clause are replaced by a quote noun phrase, which consists ofa quote noun and a possessor. The quote noun consists of the
base of the verb in the corresponding basic clause and the
possessor corresponds to the subject of the basic clause. The
quote noun phrase corresponds to a subject and verb in
English. The constructions derived from the basic quote
clauses in section 3.95 are:
Terima kasih"", katanya.
""Thank you"", he said.
""Betul"", jawab Dewi.
""That is correct"", replied Dewi.
MThe direct speech can be anything from a single word to a
long construction. It can be a question, command, or
exclamation, as well as a statement. For each of the following
examples the subject and verb of the corresponding basic
clause are also given:
""Saya diperlakukan tak adil"", teriak terhukum.
[Terhukum berteriak, "".v.]
""I've been treated unjustly"", shouted the sentenced man.
""Siapa itu?"" tanyaku. [Aku bertanya, ""...]
""Who is that?"" I asked.
""Saya sudah mengundang dia"", tambahnya.
[Dia menambahkan, ""...]
Tve already invited him"", he added.
""Diusulkan agar saya belajar di Belanda"", lanjut
Kristiyanto.
[Kristiyanto melanjutkan, ""...]
""It was suggested that I study in Holland"", continued
Kristiyanto.
The direct speech can be broken up, with the quote noun
phrase being inserted within the two parts of the quote:
""Kalau gajinya tidak cukup"", ujarnya, ""jangan bekerja
- di sana"".
""If the salary isn't enough"", he said, ""don't work there"".
Some other quote nouns are the following, with -nya 'he'
given as possessor:
gerutunya he grumbled
tegasnya he asserted
jelasnya he explained
pikirnya he thought
ceritanya he related
ucapnya he pronouncedsahutnya he responded
tulisnya he wrotebentaknya he snapped
guraunya he jokedThe quote noun phrase may be followed by a number of
other clause components, such as prepositional phrases
indicating who was spoken to, the manner in which it was said,
and so on:
""Ke sini!"", bisiknya kepadaku.
""Here!"" he whispered to me.
""Kami masih berteman"", ujarnya dengan lemah-lembut.
""We're still friends"", she said softly.
""Itu bukan maksudku"", katanya sambil tersenyum.
""That's not what I meant"", she said while smiling.
Relative clauses3.97 One way of adding information about a noun is by
incorporating a clause within the noun phrase. This clause is
preceded by yang and is called a relative clause. The head of
the noun phrase corresponds to some component within the
relative clause. The noun phrase within which the relative
clause occurs, or is embedded, is called the embedding
phrase.
There are a number of different types of relative clause. The
most common of these is the defining relative clause,
described in sections 3.98-102 and usually referred to simply
as a relative clause. Other relative clauses are topic-comment
relative clauses, described in sections 3.103-5, and
prepositional relative clauses, described in section 3.106. A
fourth type of relative clause is not preceded by yang. This is
the locative relative clause, discussed in section 3.107.
Defining relative clauses3.98 A defining relative clause is one whose subject
corresponds to the head noun of the embedding phrase. In
the following sections a defining relative clause is referred to
just as a relative clause, being by far the most common type
of relative clause. The clause is incorporated, or embedded,
within the noun phrase by: (i) deleting its subject, which is
identical to the head noun of the embedding phrase, and (ii)placing yang before it. Thus, the following independent
clause: (a) Orang itu duduk dekat jendela That person is
sitting near the window', can be embedded within the subject
noun phrase of the following clause: (b) Orang itu bekerja
dengan saya That person works with me', by the two steps
above, giving: (c) Orang yang duduk dekat jendela itu
bekerja dengan saya 'The person who is sitting near the
window works with me'.
The italicised part in (c) is the relative clause; it derives from
(a) by the steps (i) and (ii) above and occurs within the
subject of (c). The subject of (c) ends with optional itu.
Although itu identifies the subject of (b), this is also achieved
by the relative clause; in this case itu is more likely to be
omitted from the embedding phrase. In journalistic style a
long relative clause is sometimes placed after a demonstrative.
This is discussed in section 2.60.
In Indonesian yang must occur before a relative clause,
although in English corresponding 'who' or 'which' can
sometimes be omitted:
Mobil yang ditubruk truk itu rusak sama sekali.
The car (which was) hit by the truck is a complete wreck.
Orang yang berkumpul di depan pintu harus pindah.
The people (who are) gathering in front of the door will
have to move.
Celana yang dibelinya kemarin terlalu kecil.
The trousers (which) he bought yesterday are too small.
3.99 A relative clause can contain any constituent
occurring in an independent clause except the subject, which
is identical to the head of the embedding noun phrase. Since
the head noun stands in the same relationship to the verb as
the subject of the clause that relationship must be shown by
the verb. If the relationship is that of actor the verb must be
active:
orang yang membangun rumah saya
the person who built my house
If the noun stands as object the verb must be passive:
tanah yang sudah digarapland which has been worked
The rule that the verb must be passive following a noun which
stands as object to it can cause difficulty for English speakers
as in English the verb can be, and usually is, active in this
context:
Rumah yang dibangun Pak Dani tidak begitu besar.
The house Mr Dani built isn't very big.
Bis yang saya naiki tidak berhenti di Jalan Pramuka.
The bus I got didn't stop at Pramuka Road.
Dokter yang kami telpon segera datang.
The doctor who we called quickly came.
3.100 Verbal suffixes remain unchanged in relative
clauses. Thus the head noun can have any participant role
that the subject of an independent passive clause has. In the
first example below the head noun stands as recipient and in
the second it stands as beneficiary:
Beberapa orang yang dikirimi surat belum menjawab.
Several of the people who were sent letters have not yet
replied.
Pemuda yang dicarikan pekerjaan sangat berterima
kasih.
The youth for whom work was sought was very thankful.
3.101 Sections 3.98-100 refer only to verbal relative
clauses. Relative clauses can also derive from other basic
clause types. The following are some examples of noun
phrases containing non-verbal relative clauses. The first is an
adjective relative clause (further discussed in 2.45), followed
by prepositional relative clauses:
mobil yang biru
the blue car
orang yang di sini tadi
the person who was here a while ago
anak yang seperti Tini
children who are like Tini
Noun relative clauses rarely occur. Normally yang cannot
precede a noun. However, a noun relative clause can be usedwhen the speaker wishes to distinguish a person from other
people with similar characteristics, especially the same name:
Soeharto yang presiden
Soeharto who is president (not some other Soeharto)
Moreover, there is a growing tendency, especially in
journalistic style, to allow noun relative clauses to add
information about the head noun, rather than to identify,
although this is not acceptable to all speakers:
Pemerintah mengizinkan Zardari, yang juga anggota
parlemen, untuk menghadiri sidang.
The government allowed Zadari, who is also a member of
parliament, to attend the session.
Ibu Alieva, yang seorang ibu, akan kami jemput.
Mrs Alieva, who is a woman, will be met by us.
3.102 A number of relative clauses can occur within the
one noun phrase. The following example contains adjective
and verbal relative clauses:
pertambangan-pertambangan yang penting yang
menghasilkan bahan tambang strategis
important mines which produce strategic minerals
Topic-comment relative clauses3.103 Both possessor topic-comment clauses (see 3.88)
and object topic-comment clauses (see 3.91) can be
embedded in noun phrases. The topic of the topic-comment
clause is deleted; the noun of the embedding phrase then
stands as topic (not subject) to the relative clause. The -nya in
the relative clause identifies the head of the noun phrase.
Possessor topic-comment relative clauses meaning
'whose'3.104 In possessor topic-comment relative clauses, which
translate constructions with 'whose' in English, the subject of
the relative clause is the thing possessed by the head noun.
The first example below derives from the independent clause
Sopir itu namanya Ali 'That driver's name is Ali':
sopir yang namanya Ali
the driver whose name is Ali
orang yang mobilnya dicurithe person whose car was stolen
jalan yang panjangnya sekitar 18 kilometer
a road whose length is about 18 kilometers
If the subject of a topic-comment clause is something
inalienably possessed by the topic it can occur after the
predicate, as discussed in section 3.89. This rule also applies
in relative topic-comment clauses:
lima puluh empat negara Afrika yang diakui
kedaulatannya
fifty four African nations whose sovereignty is recognised
kawasan yang dipuji kebersihannya ini
this region whose cleanliness has been praised
seorang pejabat yang tidak akan disebutkan namanya
an official whose name will not be mentioned
gadis yang kami kagumi kecantikan dan kelembutannya
itu
the girl whose beauty and gentleness we admired
Object topic-comment relative clauses3.105 The head of the embedding phrase is identical to the
object of the relative clause and is marked by -nya occurring
in object position within the clause. In the first example
below the head of the embedding phrase harapan 'hope is
also object of the verb menyelesaikan 'fulfil':
Saya banyak menciptakan harapan bagi rakyat yang
saya sendiri tidak mampu menyelesaikannya.
I created many hopes for the people which I myself was
not able to fulfil.
senjata yang tidak setiap musuh bisa menghadapinya
weapons which not every enemy can face
sebuah lagu yang barangkali saudara akan
menyukainya
a song which perhaps you will like
1Prepositional relative clauses3.106 In these constructions the head of the embedding
phrase is not identical to the subject (or topic) of the relative
clause. Instead it is identical to the noun in a prepositional
phrase (see 2.118), usually one indicating location. The noun
following the preposition is deleted and replaced by -nya.","[310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317]"
"1Prefix ke-1.151 This is added to cardinal numbers to form ordinals
(see 2.16):
kedua second
ketiga third
kesepuluh tenth
kedua puluh tiga twenty third
For 'first' the form kesatu occurs but pertama is more
common.
Ordinals are sometimes written with Roman numerals, in
which case ke- is not shown:
HUT XIX (= hari ulang tahun kesembilan belas)
nineteenth anniversary
1.152 Prefix ke- also forms the interrogative ordinal
keberapa 'how many' (see 4.20) and the indefinite ordinal
kesekian 'umpteenth' (see 2.198).
1.153 Forms derived with ke- are also used for collective
numbers (see 2.17):
keempat all four kelima all five
Suffix -an1.154 This suffix occurs with group numbers (see 2.107)
with several meanings.
1.155 With group numbers, but not with their multiples,
-an indicates an indefinite multiple of the group number:
puluhan tens
ribuan thousands
puluhan ribu mobil tens of thousands of cars
Belasan indicates an indefinite number between ten and
twenty:belasan hari about two weeks
1.156 With multiples of group numbers it indicates an
estimate, 'about so many, that number or so':
delapan puluhan about eighty, eighty odd
dua ratusan about two hundred
Rumah mereka ditembaki oleh lima puluhan pasukan
tak dikenal.
Their houses were fired on by about fifty unidentified
soldiers.
1.157 With dates which are multiples of puluh the form
refers to a particular decade:
tahun-tahun delapan puluhan
the nineteen eighties
Ia anggota politbiro PKI pada awal 1920-an.
He was a member of the PKI politbureau in the early
1920s.
Prefix ber~1.158 Attached to cardinal numbers from 'two' to 'four' this
derives numbers referring to a group:
berdua both, two together
bertiga all three, three together
berempat all four, four together
These forms occur with pronouns (see 2.79 for examples) but
not with nouns.
1.159 These forms also function as adverbs of manner
meaning 'together in a group of [base]':
Mereka selalu bersepeda berdua.
They always cycle together (in a group of two).
Mereka makan sepiring nasi berempat.
They ate a plate of rice together in a group of four.
1.160 With reduplicated numbers from 'two' to 'four' berforms adverbs indicating '(acting) in a number of groups of
[base] at a time':
berdua-dua two at a time, two by two
bertiga-tiga three at a time, three by three
berempat-empat four at a time, four by fourMereka masuk berdua-dua.
They entered two by two.
Prefix ber- can be omitted from these forms (see 1.25).
1.161 Attached to reduplicated group numbers ber- forms
indefinite multiples of the base:
berpuluh-puluh tens
beratus-ratus hundreds
berjuta-juta millions
berpuluh-puluh tahun yang lalu
decades ago
Beribu-ribu orang menderita akibat perang itu.
Thousands of people suffered as a result of the war.
1.162 With reduplicated nouns referring to containers,
weights and measures, ber- forms quantifiers meaning 'in
numbers of [base]' (see 2.33), similar in function to forms
based on numbers (see 1.161) and on periods of time (see
1.144):
berbotol-botol bottles and bottlesful
berkarung-karung sacksful
berkeranjang-keranjang basketsful
berkilo-kilo kilos and kilos
bermeter-meter meters and meters
bertimbun-timbun piles and piles
berton-ton tons and tons
Bangunan ini menghabiskan berton-ton batu bata.
This building used up tons and tons of bricks.
Polisi menyita berbotol-botol minuman keras.
Police confiscated bottles and bottles of alcohol.
Circumfix ber-...-an1.163 this occurs with the numeral dua 'two , with optional
reduplication, to form an adverb meaning 'together', of action
performed by two people:
Dia duduk berdua(-dua)an dengan pacarnya.
He sat together with his girl friend.
1Derivation of verbs1.164 For ease and clarity of description two groups of
verbs are recognised here: primary and secondary verbs.
Primary verbs are those which occur with primary affixation,
as described in sections 1.165-2.45. Secondary verbs are
those which have secondary affixation, which replaces
primary affixation under certain circumstances. Secondary
verbs are described in sections 1.246-85.
Every verb is either transitive or intransitive. Transitive verbs
can have an object and a passive form; intransitive verbs have
neither. Transitivity is discussed in 3.18-25.
Verbs are based on nouns, adjectives and other classes. A
base which cannot occur alone as a word is a verbal base.
Thus atur cannot occur alone but is the base for verbs such as
mengatur 'organise ; it is therefore a verbal base.
1Primary verbs1.165 Primary verbs are either intransitive or transitive.
Intransitive primary verbs are simple, that is, they have no
affix, or have prefix ber- or meN-. All transitive primary
verbs occur with one of the inflectional voice affixes, meN- or
di-. Transitive verbs are either simple, having no affix other
than meN- or di-, or they occur with one of the following
affixes or affix combinations: -kan, -i, per-, per-...-kan, perSimple intransitive verbs1.166 A simple intransitive verb occurs alone without an
affix. There are a great many of these, of which the following
are a small sample:
benci hate
bangun wake up
datang come
cinta love
gagal fail
duduk sit
ikut follow
hidup live
ingat remember
jatuh fall
kembali return
lenyap disappear
lupa forget
lulus pass
masuk enter
mandi bathmati die
mulai begin
pergi go
selesai finish
tenggelam sink
tiba arrivemenang win
percaya believe
pindah move
tahu know
terbang fly
tidur sleepIntransitive verbs with ber-1.167 Some ber- verbs have verbal bases. It is difficult to
assign a meaning to ber- with such bases other than that its
presence is necessary to produce a well-formed verb. Some
of these verbs take a complement (see 3.63-4):
berangkat leave
berenang swim
berbaring lie
belajar study
berbuat do
berhenti stop
bekerja work
berdiri stand
bertemu meet
berubah change
berpikir think
bertiup blow
bercukur shave
berputar turn
1.168 A few ber- verbs which refer to reflexive action
optionally take diri 'self in a compound form:
berdiam (diri) be silent
berjemur (diri) sunbake, go out in the sun
berhias (diri) dress, groom oneself
In this construction diri cannot be expanded as it can when it
is a separate phrase (see 2.162ff).
1.169 The largest group of ber- verbs have noun bases.
With these it is possible to assign a function to ber-. There is
considerable variation in the categories recognised by
different writers and the function of the prefix with some
noun bases is open to different interpretations. However,
there is little purpose in striving to identify a large number of
categories, each with a small number of members and a very
narrow semantic range. The groupings suggested here could
all be subdivided into smaller groups.
1.170 The largest group has a general meaning 'have, own
[base]'. Some of these verbs do not translate well as 'have[base] , such as berdebu 'dusty (literally 'have dust ), or
berguna 'useful* ('have use'); in such cases the appropriate
gloss is provided. Some of these verbs take a complement
(see 3.64). This group includes:
berguna useful
beristeri have a wife
berisi contain
berbau smell
berduri thorny
berdebu dusty
berumur be aged
beranak have children
bermaksud mean
berhasil succeed
bernama be named
berpendapat have the opinion
1111.171 Some verbs mean 'to use, wear, travel by [base]'. TQ
this group can be added forms based on pronouns meaning
'use [base] when speaking to someone':
bertopi wear a hat
berbedak wear powder
berdasi wear a tie
berkuda ride a horse
berjas wear a jacket
berperahu go by boat
bersepatu wear shoes
bersepeda ride a bicycle
berbapak use bapak 'father' when addressing someone
beraku use aku T when speaking to someone
1.172 Another subgroup of ber- verbs mean 'produce
[base]'. Many of these refer to production of the sound
indicated by the base:
berbohong lie
berkeringat sweat
berdesing whizz, buzz
bertelur lay an egg
berkokok crow
beranak give birth
berderit squeak
berbuah bear fruit
berbunyi make a sound
berteriak scream
berkata say
bercerita relate, tell a story
1.173 Some ber- verbs with noun bases are reciprocal,
indicating that two people stand in the same relationship to
each other, as specified by the base. Thus bertetangga 'be
neighbours', as in Ali dan Tomo bertetangga 'Ali and Tomo
are neighbours (with each other)':
berteman be friends
bermusuh be enemies
bersahabat be friendsberkenalan be acquaintances
berkerabat be related
bertunangan be engaged to each other
bersaudara be relatives of same generation
bersaingan be competitors, compete (with each other)
The verbs berkenalan, bertunangan, bersaingan and similar
forms having suffix -an are regarded here as being built on
bases kenalan 'acquaintance , tunangan 'fiance , saingan
'competitor', and so on. They could alternatively be treated as
ber-...-an reciprocal verbs (see 1,255ff) built on verbal bases
such as kenal, tunang and saing.
111.174 Some ber- verbs refer to work which is regularly
performed or done for a living. In this group are included
some verbs with verbal bases:
berdagang engage in trade
berkebun own or work gardens
berkuli work as a labourer
berladang own or work unirrigated fields
bersawah own or work rice fields
bertani farm
bertukang work as an artisan
beternak engage in animal farming
Some verbs in this group optionally have a complement (see
3.64). These differ from transitive verbs with an object in that
they specify habitual action rather than an action performed
on a particular object:
berburu (rusa) engage in (deer) hunting
bertanam (jagung) plant (corn) (as an occupation)
1.175 Similar to verbs listed in 1.174 are those which mean
'engage in the activity specified by the base'; many of these
are based on nouns referring to types of sport:
berolah raga play sport
bertinju box
bergulat wrestle
berpiknik go on a picnic
berperang wage war
berbelanja go shoppingbertamasya go sight-seeing
berdarmawisata go on an excursion
1.176 Many ber- verbs have noun bases which are phrases.
Although these are written as separate words they act as a
single unit to which ber- is attached. As free forms the bases
are noun phrases consisting usually of a noun and noun (see
2.37) or noun and adjective (see 2.45). Thus the phrase
celana pendek 'short pants' becomes the base of the verb
bercelana pendek 'wear short pants'. Other compounds
consist of a noun plus number. In a free phrase the number
precedes the noun (see 2.14); it is placed after the noun when
the phrase becomes a verbal base. Thus dua anak 'two
children' forms the base of beranak dua 'have two children':
berbaju kulit wear a leather coat
berkaki panjang have long legs
berkebun kelapa have a coconut plantation
berkepala gundul have a shaved head
berpendidikan rendah be poorly educated
bertubuh kurus be thin (have a thin body)
bertingkat tiga have three storeys, three-storey
Such phrasal verb bases should not be confused with verbs
followed by a complement. In the sentence Dia bernama Ali
'He is named Ali', the verb bernama 'have the name' is
followed by a complement, Ali. The words nama 'name' and
Ali do not form a phrase but rather a clause, Nama(nya) Ali
'His name is Ali'. Such complements are described in section
3.64.
1.177 A few ber- verbs have adjective bases:
bergembira be glad
berbahagia be happy
berterus-terang be frank bersedih be sad
berkeras persist
bersabar be patient
Prefix ber- combined with prefix si-1.178 The combination bersi- occurs with a few verbs. In
all cases si- is optional:
bersikeras, berkeras persist
bersitegang, bertegang persevere
bersikukuh, berkukuh be stubborn, persistbersijingkat, berjingkat walk on tiptoes
Intransitive verbs with meN-1.179 Some intransitive verbs with prefix meN- have verbal
bases. MeN- cannot be assigned a function with these verbs,
other than that its presence is required to produce a wellformed verb. Verbs in this group include:
menangis cry
mendidih boil
menyerah surrender
mengungsi flee
melapor report
meledak explode
menyanyi sing
menyuruk hide
mengeluh complain
menelentang lie on the back
meluncur slide
menginap spend the night
menikah marry
melompat jump
1.180 Many meN- intransitive verbs have noun bases. As
with ber- verbs based on nouns, a number of different
meanings can be identified.
1.181 Some verbs mean 'go to [base]', where the base refers
to a location:
mendarat land
menepi move to the side
melaut go to sea
mengutara go north
menyeberang cross to the other side
1.182 Others mean 'produce [base]', where the base is a
sound:
mengeong miouw
meraung roar
menjerit scream
mendengkur snore
menggonggong bark
mengeluh groan
mengerang groan
memekik scream
1.183 Some meN- verbs with noun bases mean 'become
like, resemble [base]':
memuncak reach a crest, culminate
menggunung pile up, mount up
membatu petrify, harden
membukit form a heap, resemble a hill
membabi buta rage blindly1.184 With adjective bas< meN- usually forms verbs
meaning 'become [base], take the characteristic of [base]':
membengkak swell
menghebat intensify
menguning grow yellow
menghangat warm up
mereda calm down, abate membusuk rot, decay
memutih become white
mengering dry
memerah redden,
menyempit tighten,
become red
constrict
Prefix meN- cannot be added to all adjectives with this
meaning. The number of such forms is limited and
unpredictable, although there is some degree of productivity.
4The verb memanjang (panjang long') means 'stretch', as in
Pantai itu memanjang dari barat ke timur 'The beach
stretches from west to east'.
Comparison of simple, ber- and meN- intransitive verbs1.185 Verb bases occur with ber-, meN- or without
affixation unpredictably. For instance, there is no
explanation for the following forms other than usage: mandi
'bath', berbaring 'lie down', menginap 'stay'. With such forms
ber- and meN- can be ascribed no function other than that
they are required with particular bases.
If the base is other than a verb then either ber- or meN- must
occur to derive a verb. Here also there is sometimes no
predictability about which affix will occur. Thus: berteriak
'yell, shout', memekik 'scream'.
With a number of bases ber- and meN- can substitute for each
other, although usually one form is more common than the
other. A number of these forms mean 'produce the sound
indicated by the base'. Others have verb bases:
bernyanyi, menyanyi sing
berderit, menderit scream
There is disagreement as to the acceptability of some forms. Thus
Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (1991) gives membiru 'become
blue', whereas Dardjowidjojo (1978: 264) rules this word out. Such
disagreement reflects a degree of productivity and the gradual spread
of meN- to an increasing number of adjective bases.","[85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"
"Reduplication of verbs1*19 Unlike nouns, complex verbs do not undergo full
reduplication. Instead, bases are repeated and affixes then
attached to them. There are several functions.
1.20 With some verbs reduplication gives a connotation of
action done in a casual or leisurely way:
duduk sit : duduk-duduk sit about
berjalan walk : berjalan-jalan walk about, go for a stroll
melihat see : melihat-lihat browse, have a look around
membuka open : membuka-buka (buku) leaf through (a
book)
1.21 With many verbs reduplication indicates continued
tion, either an action done over a period of time or an
action performed repeatedly:
Bu Yem mengurut-urut rambut anaknya.
Mrs Yem stroked her child's hair (a number of times).
Potongan kayu itu terapung-apung di atas air.
The piece of wood floated on the water.
Dia berteriak-teriak memanggil pelayan.
He shouted and shouted for the waiter.
Menteri menunda-nunda keberangkatannya.
The minister kept delaying his departure,
ac1*22 With some verbs reduplication gives a meaning
somewhat different from that of the single form, usually
conveying a sense of intensity:
menjadi become : menjadi-jadi get worse
meminta request : meminta-minta beg
membesarkan enlarge : membesar-besarkan exaggerate
berganti replace : berganti-ganti alternate, keep
changing places
1*23 Accompanied by tidak 'not' reduplication of the
erb can indicate that the action has not occurred, usually
implying that this is contrary to expectation:
Sudah dua hari Pak Tanto tidak muncul-muncul.
Mr Tanto hasn't turned up for two days now.
Perembukan mereka tidak menyinggung-nyinggung
masalah pemerintah persatuan nasional.
yTheir deliberations did not touch on the matter of a
government of national unity.
1.24 A few verbs, including datang 'come', bangun 'wake
up', pulang 'arrive home', can be reduplicated to function like
correlative clauses introduced by begitu 'no sooner' (see
4.89):
Bangun-bangun mereka sudah bertengkar.
No sooner were they awake than they began to argue.
Reduplication of numbers1.25 This forms adverbs meaning 'in a group of so many':
Bicaralah satu-satu.
Speak one at a time.
Mereka masuk dua-dua.
They came in two at a time.
The numbers can also be separated by demi or per (see
2.177). Numbers for 'two' to 'four' can also occur with prefix
ber- (see 1.160).
Partial reduplication1.26 Partial reduplicaton occurs only with bases which
begin with a consonant. It involves placing before the base a
syllable consisting of the first consonant of the base followed
by e. This type of reduplication is no longer productive in
the language; it occurs with a few bases, mainly nouns, and
cannot be applied to others. The reduplicated word has a
meaning which is the same as that of the single form or
related to. Sometimes, as in the first example below, the
historical relationship is not obvious:
tangga ladder : tetangga neighbour
jaka bachelor : jejaka bachelor
laki husband : lelaki man
luhur noble : leluhur ancestor
tamu guest : tetamu guest
tua old : tetua eldersImitative reduplication1.27 In imitative reduplication the two parts of the word
are not identical, though they are similar. Nouns, adjectives
and verbs can all undergo imitative reduplication. The
variation between the two parts of the word can involve either
consonants or vowels. Imitative reduplication is not
productive; new forms cannot be created nor can the two parts
of the word change places. Frequently only the first
component of the word occurs as a simple word. In some
cases neither part can occur alone. The reduplication usually
indicates variety or emphasises the meaning of the first
component. Imitative reduplication is not greatly different
from some types of compounding (see 1.31) and could
alternatively be placed in that category.
1.28 The difference may be only the first consonant:
sayur-mayur 'vegetables' (sayur 'vegetable'), lauk-pauk 'side
dishes' (lauk 'side dish'), ramah-tamah 'hospitable and
friendly' (ramah 'friendly'), cerai-berai 'scattered, dispersed'
(cerai 'separated', berai 'dispersed'), kaya-raya 'very wealthy'
(kaya 'rich , raya 'great').
1In one case two consonants are different: pecah-belah
'broken into pieces' (pecah 'broken', belah 'crack').
1.29 The difference may be in the vowels. There may be
only one vowel difference: desas-desus 'rumour', warnawarni 'all kinds of colours' (warna 'colour'), gerak-gerik
'movements, gestures' (gerak 'movement').
Usually there are two vowel differences. It is most common
for the first component to contain the vowels o...a and the
second component to contain the vowels a..J, although these
are not the only combinations. Often with this type of
imitative reduplication neither part of the word can occur
alone: bolak-balik 'to and fro' (balik 'return'), pontangpanting 'run helter skelter , obrak-abrik 'destroy, smash to
pieces', mundar-mandir 'back and forth', tindak-tanduk
'behaviour (tindak 'action'), asal-usul 'origin, descent' (asal
'origin'), teka-teki 'riddle'.
11Compounds1.30 A compound is a combination of two simple words
which come together to form a complex word. Thus tanda
'sign and tangan 'hand' combine in the compound
tandatangan 'signature . Not all compounds are written as a
single word; some are usually hyphenated, such as pemudapemudi 'young people', while others are often written as two
words, such as salah paham 'misunderstand'. There is
considerable inconsistency in the usage of different people.
It is usual for such forms to be written without a space or with
a hyphen when they form the base for a derived word:
kesalahpahaman, kesalah-pahaman 'misunderstanding'.
11A sequence of words may not be a compound when standing
alone but may become such when acting as the base for an
affixed form. Thus peti es 'ice box' is a phrase rather than a
compound, but it is a compound base in the verbal form
mempeti-eskan 'leave for later consideration'.
1.31 Some compounds resemble imitative reduplication
(see 1.27-9). In these compounds, however, there are
differences of both vowel and consonant; the two parts can
also have different numbers of syllables. The parts occur as
separate words, usually with very similar meanings. These
forms are almost entirely adjectives; they are similar in
meaning to one or both parts alone but the meaning is more
intensive: gelap gulita 'pitch dark' (gelap 'dark', gulita 'dark'),
kelam kabut 'foggy, murky' (kelam 'dull, overcast', kabut
'fog'), lemah lembut 'gentle, graceful' (lemah 'weak', lembut
'soft'), sunyi senyap 'deathly still' (sunyi 'lonely, quiet', senyap
'quiet, deserted'), terang benderang 'very bright' (terang
bright', benderang 'bright').
1.32 A compound may consist of two words occurring as
noun and adjective or as noun and modifying noun which are
treated as a single unit for the purpose of affixation, that is,
they combine as the base of a complex word. Many of these,
such as kambing hitam 'scapegoat', have an idiomatic
meaning. As idioms they act like single words, not only
combining for the purposes of affixation, but not being
separable when occurring without affixation. Thus in theabove example the idiom is lost if the words are separated by
yang; kambing yang hitam can only mean 'a goat which is
black (see also 2.45). As mentioned in 1.30, some
combinations, such as peti es 'ice box , only have idiomatic
meaning when forming the base of a complex word.
111.33 Some compound nouns form the base for verbs,
such as the following:
kambing hitam scapegoat : mengkambing-hitamkan put
the blame on, make a scapegoat
tandatangan signature : menandatangani sign
titik berat centre of gravity, most important aspect :
menitik-beratkan stress, emphasise
A few compound nouns consist of two verb bases. These then
form the base for complex verbs:
serah terima transfer (serah 'surrender , terima 'receive') :
menyerah-terimakan handover, transfer (authority)
1Some compounds function both as intransitive and transitive
verbs:
ikut serta participate : mengikutsertakan include, let
(someone) participate
putar balik turn over : memutarbalikkan turn
(something) over
bertanggung-jawab be responsible : mempertanggungjawabkan account for, justify
1.34 The following compounds function as both nouns
and verbs:
makan pagi breakfast; eat breakfast
makan siang lunch; eat lunch
makan malam dinner; eat dinner
1.35 In a number of cases two nouns can be juxtaposed to
form a compound where the words are separated by 'and' in
English. In other cases two words of similar meaning are
compounded:
anak cucu children and grandchildren
kasih sayang love and affection
pemuda pemudi youths, young men and womenputra putri sons and daughters
suami istri married couple, husband and wife
harta benda wealth, property
sanak saudara relatives
warta berita news
Infixes1.36 Infixation is not productive and only a limited
number of infixed forms occur Because of this infixed
forms are no longer felt by most people to contain an affix
and they are listed separately from their bases in dictionaries.
The infixes are -em-, -el-, -er-. The meaning of the infix is
unpredictable. Infixed forms have the same meaning as the
simple form or a meaning related to it:
gigi tooth : gerigi serration
suling flute : seruling flute
tapak palm, sole : telapak sole, palm
tunjuk point : telunjuk index finger
getar vibrate : gemetar tremble
1.37 A few forms infixed with -em- occur only as a
reduplication of the base form of the word. Such words
convey a meaning which is similar to that of the base alone or
which is an intensity of the meaning of the base:
kilau shine : kilau-kemilau shine brightly
tali rope : tali-temali all sorts of rope
turun descend : turun-temurun hereditary
In at least one case the base does not occur alone: gilanggemilang 'brilliant'.
AFFIXES1.38 In the following sections of this chapter the prefixes,
suffixes and circumfixes of the language are described.
When the function of an affix can be adequately described
without reference to context single words are given as
examples. When it is necessary to include a discussion of
context in the description of an affix examples are given in
context.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53]"
"A word consisting of an affix or more than one affix plus
base can be reduplicated: perubahan-perubahan (from base
ubah), tulisan-tulisan (from base tulis).
A base can be reduplicated and affixes can then be added to
the reduplicated base: kemerah-merahan (from base merah),
berkali-kali (from base kali), sebesar-besarnya (from base
besar), melihat-lihat (from base lihat).
Full reduplication has many functions. Sometimes
reduplication of bases cannot be discussed separately from a
consideration of the affixes with which it occurs. For
instance, the function of the reduplication of the bases in
kuda-kudaan 'toy horse and sebesar-besarnya 'as big as
possible is dependent on the particular combination of base
and affix and cannot be described free from the overall forms
in which it occurs. Such reduplication is discussed under the
individual affixes. On the other hand, most full reduplication
of words, whether simple or complex, and of some bases in
complex words, can be described free from a consideration of
the particular affixes accompanying it. Such reduplication is
discussed in the following sections.
11Reduplication without corresponding single bases1*11 Sometimes reduplicated forms have no
unreduplicated counterparts to which they can be related.
Such forms are often treated as single bases in dictionaries,
although usually written with a hyphen. Such forms includetiba-tiba 'suddenly', sia-sia 'futile', pura-pura 'pretend',
megap-megap 'pant', masing-masing 'each'. Although single
bases with the same form sometimes occur these are chance
similarities. Thus the word tiba 'arrive' has no relationship (at
least in modern Indonesian) to tiba-tiba 'suddenly'.
Reduplication of nouns1.12 Where a noun can occur singly or repeated the
reduplication has a number of functions, as discussed in
sections 1.13-4.
Some nouns consisting of repeated forms are of the type
mentioned in 1.11 and are thus single bases. Many of these
words are names of plants and animals, types of food, and
instruments, although such formations are not confined to
these categories: cumi-cumi 'squid', kupu-kupu 'butterfly',
alang-alang 'tall grass species', koma-koma 'saffron', gadogado 'mixed vegetable dish', ani-ani 'small harvest knife',
oleh-oleh 'gift'. Sometimes a reduplicated form refers to
something having two or more similar parts; a single base
rarely or never occurs: paru-paru 'lungs', baling-baling
'propeller', anting-anting 'ear ring'.
1.13 Reduplication may produce a meaning which is
different but nevertheless related to the meaning of the single
base. Dictionaries inconsistently list such reduplicated forms
under the single base or as separate entries. Such forms
include:
gula sugar : gula-gula sweets
laki husband : laki-laki man
mata eye : mata-mata spy
kuda horse : kuda-kuda easel; trestle
langit sky : langit-langit ceiling
In a few cases such words can also indicate plurality (see
1.14). Thus kuda-kuda 'horses', mata-mata rantai 'links of a
chain'.
1.14 The major function of noun reduplication is to
indicate plurality. Both simple and complex nouns can be
reduplicated to indicate plurality: rumah-rumah 'houses',singkatan-singkatan 'abbreviations', perubahan-perubahan
'changes .
1A noun is not usually reduplicated unless it is unclear from
context whether one or more than one is referred to and then
only if this is important to what the speaker wishes to convey.
In the first example below the number makes plurality
specific, while in the second sentence plurality is clear from
the general context; one does not usually buy a single shoe:
Menteri mengunjungi tiga negeri asing.
The minister visited three foreign countries.
Saya harus membeli sepatu baru.
I must buy new shoes.
Sometimes, however, a speaker does use reduplication even
though plurality is clear from context:
Pulau-pulau Bali, Lombok dan Sumbawa terletak di
sebelah timur pulau Jawa*
The islands of Bali, Lombok and Sumbawa are located east
of Java.
Reduplication does not occur if a whole class of things is
referred to. Neither noun in the following sentence can be
reduplicated:
Anjing suka tulang.
Dogs like bones.
It is sometimes stated that reduplication of nouns indicates
variety rather than plurality (although plurality is implied by
variety). Indonesian writers disagree on this question, but
clearly reduplication can be used where variety is of no
importance. In the following sentences there is no focus at all
on variation among the mango trees, links of the chain or
water containers; what is stressed is that there is more than
one:
Rumahnya dekat pohon-pohon mangga itu.
His house is near those mango trees.
Mata-mata rantai berbentuk bulat.
The links of the chain are round.
Pada pinggangnya terikat bumbung-bumbung kosong.
At his waist are tied empty bamboo water containers.","[43, 44, 45]"
"These forms can occur as subjects in topic-comment
constructions (see 3.90).
2.95 Several indefinite numbers (see 2.113) can occur as
pronouns, in which case they take suffix -nya. These include:
semuanya all of them
segalanya all of them
seluruhnya all of it, the whole
Tidak semuanya meninggal.
Not all of them died.
These forms can occur as subjects in topic-comment
constructions (see 3.90).
2.96 Masing-masing can occur as a number pronoun
meaning 'each of them'; it does not take -nya:
Kedua kota itu hampir sama besarnya. Masing-masing
berpenduduk sekitar empat ratus ribu orang.
Those two cities are almost the same size. Each of them
has a population of about four hundred thousand people.
ADJECTIVES AND ADJECTIVE
PHRASES2.97 An adjective phrase is a sequence of words which
functions in the same way as an adjective; that is, it occurs in
the same positions in a clause as a single adjective. It always
contains an adjective as its head. Adjectives are discussed in
section 2.98. The other major components of adjective
phrases are discussed in 2.99-105.
Adjectives2.98 An adjective is a word which describes a noun; it tells
something about a person or thing, such as its shape or size
(besar 'big', bulat 'round', gemuk 'fat'), colour (hijau 'green',hitam 'black'), condition (bersih 'clean', kotor 'dirty', rusak
'broken') or other characteristics (baik 'good', pandai 'clever',
senang 'happy', cantik 'pretty', hati-hati 'careful').
Two adjectives may form a compound (see 1.31). The order
of the two adjectives in such compounds is fixed; the second
word usually acts to strengthen the meaning of the first word,
as in lemah lembut 'gentle'.
A compound may also consist of an adjective and a following
noun. Such forms are idiomatic, such as buta huruf 'illiterate',
keras kepala 'stubborn', panjang tangan 'having a tendency
to steal'.
A compound may consist of a colour term and a following
noun or adjective which makes it more specific: merah tua
'dark red', biru muda 'light blue', hijau daun 'leaf green',
kuning gading 'ivory yellow'.
Two adjectives may be juxtaposed to form a kind of
coordination, without dan 'and' occurring between them. The
order of adjectives in such pairs is fixed, such as tinggi kurus
'tall and thin', tegap gesit 'firm and agile':
Perawakannya tinggi langsing, pembawaannya tegap
gesit
Her figure was tall and slender, her bearing firm and agile.
Other pairs like this include hitam manis 'dark and attractive',
tinggi tegap 'tall and strong', halus mulus 'fine and smooth',
cerdas tangkas 'intelligent and quick-witted'.
Juxtaposed adjectives may also indicate alternatives, atau 'or'
being omitted between them, such as panjang pendek 'long or
short', baik buruk 'good or bad'. Such pairs, written with a
hyphen and followed by -nya, are frequently nominalised
(see 3.139).
A number of verbs can act as adjectives, being able to occur
with many of the components of the adjective phrase, such as
modifying adverbs, lebih 'more', and paling 'most'. These
include membosankan 'boring' and similar forms (see 1.194),menarik 'attractive', and many of the verbs with prefix berbased on nouns (see 1.169ff), such as berbahaya 'dangerous',
berhasil 'successful', berguna 'useful'. The indefinite
numbers banyak 'much' and sedikit 'a little' can also function
in the same way (see examples in 2.113).
Adjective phrases2.99 Adjectives act as heads of a variety of different
phrase structures. Some of the important components of
adjective phrases are discussed in the following sections. Not
all adjectives can occur with all the phrase elements discussed;
some subclasses of adjective are restricted in the elements with
which they can co-occur.
Modifying adverbs2.100 The adjective can be preceded by one of a number
of modifying adverbs. These show the amount or intensity of
the quality indicated by the adjective. These include:
sangat, amat very
terlalu, terlampau too
sungguh really, truly
cukup enough
relatif relatively
serba completely
agak rather
makin, semakin, kian, tambah, bertambah increasingly
begitu, demikian, sedemikian so, like that
begini so, like this
Beban ini sungguh berat.
This load is truly heavy.
Tingkat radiasi relatif tinggi.
The radiation level is relatively high.
Iran secara militer sudah makin kuat.
Militarily Iran has become increasingly strong.
Mengapa saudara demikian lelah?
Why are you so tired?
A number of modifying adverbs follow the adjective,
including:
sekali verybelaka entirely, completely
sama sekali entirely
benar really
Janjinya palsu belaka.
His promises are completely false.
Urusannya sudah beres sama sekali.
His affairs are entirely in order.
The adverb sedikit 'a little can precede or follow the adjective:
sedikit pusing/pusing sedikit
a little dizzy
1A few modifying adverbs can co-occur for emphasis. The
commonest combinations are amat sangat 'exceedingly',
sangat... sekali 'exceedingly', agak ... sedikit 'somewhat':
Daging ini agak mahal sedikit.
This meat is somewhat expensive.
Dia amat sangat kaya.
He is extremely rich.
Some of the modifying adverbs, including cukup 'enough'
and terlalu 'too', can cooccur with a phrase beginning with
untuk, bagi or buat 'for' (see 2.105).
When the adjective phrase occurs as a predicate (see 3.9) with
tidak most speakers replace sekali 'very' by begitu 'so':
Rumahnya tidak begitu besar.
His house isn't very big.
Modifying adverbs like makin commonly occur in correlative
structures, such as:
Ali makin besar makin sombong.
The older Ali gets the more arrogant he becomes.
These constructions are discussed in section 4.90.
Comparative phrases2.101 The comparative adjective phrase is formed by
placing lebih 'more' or kurang 'less' before the adjective:
lebih besar 'bigger', lebih jelas 'clearer', lebih indah 'more
beautiful', kurang mahal 'less expensive':Saya minta air yang kurang panas.
Could I have water which isn't so hot.
The major expansion of the comparative phrase is with dari
or daripada 'than' followed by a noun phrase indicating the
person or thing with which comparison is being made :
Dia lebih tinggi dari saya»
He is taller than me.
Mobil Jepang kurang mahal daripada mobil Amerika.
Japanese cars are less expensive than American cars.
3Lebih can itself be preceded by a number of modifiers,
including jauh 'far , sedikit 'a little', a number followed by kali
'times' (see 2.197), or a noun indicating distance, weight or
measure:
Rumah ini jauh lebih mahal dari rumah itu.
This house is far more expensive than that one.
Situasi hari Minggu sedikit lebih tenang.
The situation on Sunday was a little calmer.
Kota ini dua puluh kali lebih besar.
This town is twenty times bigger.
Jalan ini tiga meter lebih lebar daripada jalan-jalan
lain.
This road is three meters wider than the other roads.
1Kurang can be replaced by kalah. Preceded by a negative
only kalah can occur:
Tuti kurang/kalah cantik.
Tuti is less pretty.
""Siapa bilang?"" bantah saya, tak kalah keras.
""Who said so?"" I protested, no less harshly.
When kalah occurs dari(pada) can be replaced by dengan:
Verhaar (1988: 56) says dari is more colloquial than daripada 'but
not distinctly substandard while Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa
Indonesia (1988: 216) says dari is non-standard. Chaer (1988:
163) advises against use of dari in comparative constructions.
However, while this stand is taken by some grammarians it is not
generally accepted and dari is by far the more frequent of the two in
both formal and informal Indonesian.
1Tulisan Subagio tidak kalah blak-blakan dengan tulisan
orang Australia yang mana pun.
Subagio's writing is no less frank than that of any
Australian.
Superlative phrases2.102 These are formed by placing paling 'most' or prefix
ter- before the adjective: paling kaya, terkaya 'richest ,
paling tinggi, tertinggi 'highest'.
1Many people allow prefix ter- only with two syllable
adjectives; it cannot occur with longer adjectives, compounds
or verbs acting adjectivally. Thus it cannot replace paling in
paling berani 'bravest', paling berguna 'most useful', paling
menyenangkan 'most pleasing', paling keras kepala 'most
obstinate'. The exception are a few words which are actually
made adjectival by addition of ter-; thus belakang 'behind'
and ke muka 'to the front' act as adjectives only in
terbelakang 'most backward, last' and terkemuka 'most
prominent, foremost'.
A superlative phrase can be expanded by a number of
delimiting prepositional phrases, most commonly phrases
beginning with dari 'of or di 'in':
Nasi goreng yang paling enak dari semua makanan
yang tersedia.
Fried rice is the tastiest of all the food available.
Ini gempa bumi terburuk di daerah ini.
This was the worst earthquake in this district.
A superlative phrase can contain an ordinal number (see
1.151) indicating ranking. Prefix ke- on the ordinal can be
replaced by nomor 'number':
Dia petinju terbaik kedua/Dia petinju terbaik nomor dua.
He is the second best boxer.
The ordinal can precede the head of the adjective phrase, in
which case yang optionally comes between the ordinal and
head:
Ini nomor delapan terendah.
This is the eighth lowest.","[203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208]"
"Tugas itu deserahkan oleh kepala kantor kepada kami.
That task was handed by the office head to us.
3.35 In general a transformation from active to passive
has no effect on suffixes -i and -kan, which are retained when
an active verb is transformed to a passive. However, there are
some cases in which their presence or absence differs between
active and passive.
With some verbs -kan is optional in active voice but
obligatory in passive voice, including verbs with bases ajar
'teach , kirim 'send', beri 'give', nyanyi 'sing':
Dia mengajar(kan) bahasa Indonesia.
He teaches Indonesian.
Bahasa Indonesia diajarkan di sini.
Indonesian is taught here.
Dia sudah memberi(kan) uang itu kepada adiknya.
He has given the money to his brother.
Uang itu sudah diberikan kepada adiknya.
The money has been given to his brother.
Mereka menyanyi(kan) lagu Indonesia.
They are singing an Indonesian song.
Lagu apa yang mereka nyanyikan?
What song are they singing?
1On the other hand -kan is obligatory with some active verbs,
such as meninggalkan 'leave' and memaksudkan 'mean', but
can be omitted in the passive:
Dia meninggalkan tasnya di kantin.
She left her bag (deliberately) in the canteen.
Tasnya ditinggal(kan) di kantin.
Her bag was left (deliberately) in the canteen.
' Dia memaksudkan kalimat ini.
He means this sentence.
Kalimat ini yang dimaksud.
This is the sentence which is meant.
3.36 A number of -kan verbs with emotive adjective bases
are usually causative in active voice but indicate that the actorundergoes the emotion in the passive. These are discussed in
section 1.197.
3.37 Preposition dengan 'with can be omitted in a passive
clause if the subject marks the recipient. In almost all cases
the verb has locative -i and no agent is expressed:
Aku didandani pakaian pengantin.
I was adorned in bridal clothes.
Kamar-kamar di hotel ini dilengkapi sistem pendingin.
Rooms in this hotel are provided with a cooling system.
Tanah itu ditanami pohon jati.
The land was planted with teak trees.
1The verb can be a simple transitive verb but the relationship
of the subject must nevertheless be that of recipient:
Tangannya diikat tali plastik.
His hands were bound with plastic cord.
If an agent is expressed it must follow the instrument,
otherwise dengan must occur:
Kantor Monitor dilempari batu oleh sekelompok
mahasiswa Islam.
The Monitor office was pelted with stones by a group of
Moslem students.
Ladang itu ditanami oleh Pak Mendur dengan ubi.
The gardens were planted by Mr Mendur with cassava.
Dengan cannot be omitted if the subject marks the patient:
Nasi boleh dimakan dengan tangan.
Rice can be eaten by hand.
Uses of the passive3.38 As in English, passive constructions allow the
speaker to avoid mentioning the actor. This is sometimes
necessary or desired because the actor is not known, is
obvious, is not important, or because the action is something
which can be done by anyone:
Sepedanya dicuri tadi malam.
His car was stolen last night.
Saya disuruh pergi.
I was ordered to go.","[279, 280, 281]"
"Adjuncts in the noun phrase2.49 Adjuncts are discussed in sections 2.165-215. Some
adjuncts can occur within noun phrases, including adverbs of
manner (see 2.166), prepositional phrases (see 2.118ff) and
adjuncts of time (see 2.182).
Adverbs of manner which can occur in a noun phrase include
begini, semacam ini, seperti ini 'like this , begitu, demikian,
sedemikian, seperti itu 'like that :
bioskop seperti ini a cinema like this
pikiran begitu thoughts like that
11A variety of prepositional phrases can occur in the noun
phrase, of which the following are a few examples:
petani dari Aceh
a farmer from Aceh
dongeng tentang seorang haji
a story about a haji
uang untuk pondokan
money for boarding
pertemuan antara kedua pemimpin itu
a meeting between the two leaders
serangan dengan batu bata
an attack with bricks
Adjuncts of time are illustrated by the following:
pesta kemarin the party yesterday
pengumuman tadi malam the announcement last night
Functions of -nya in the noun phrase2.50 This suffix has several functions within the noun
phrase. It can function as a third person possessive pronoun
(see -2.72), or as a ligature before a possessive noun (see
2.44).
It can also occur attached to the head noun, being translated
'the . This can occur where the noun has not before been
mentioned but is understood within the context of the
utterance. Where a thing or person has recently been
mentioned itu must be used in the repetition (see 2.9). The
1different distributions of itu and -nya are shown by the
following sentences:
Ibu sudah memasak nasi. Nasi itu di lemari.
Mother has cooked rice. It is in the pantry, (literally: That
rice is in the pantry.)
Kalau mau makan, nasinya di lemari.
If you want to eat, the rice is in the pantry.
1In the first sentence above nasi itu 'that rice' refers to the rice
already mentioned. (The English translation has 'it', which
has no equivalent in Indonesian - see 2.73-4.) As nasi is not
mentioned previously in the second example, itu is not
possible. However, when reference is made to eating in
Indonesia rice is understood, and thus -nya can occur. In the
following examples perawatnya 'the nurse' and airnya 'the
water' are possible because nurses are assumed in the context
of a hospital and water is necessary for bathing:
Ia menilai pelayanan di rumah sakit cukup baik.
""Begitu dibel, perawatnya langsung datang"", katanya.
He regards service in the hospital as very good. ""No
sooner is she called than the nurse immediately comes,"" he
said.
Saya ingin mandi, tetapi airnya tidak ada.
I wanted to have a bath but there wasn't any water.
In the following examples the first sentence assumes a dog is
kept in the house, the second presupposes a newspaper is
delivered, while in the third it is understood that there is a way
to the post office:
Apa anjingnya sudah diberi makan?
Has the dog been fed?
Di mana korannya?
Where is the newspaper?
Saya mau ke kantor pos tapi tidak tahu jalannya.
I want to go to the post office but I don't know the way.
Use of -nya in this way is optional; it tends to be used by
Indonesians whose regional language has a similar
construction.
This example is taken from McGarry and Sumaryono, book 3
(1974: 42).","[177, 178, 179]"
"Other verbs like this, together with corresponding -an nouns,
include:
berhiaskan have as a decoration (hiasan), be decorated
with
berlukiskan have as a painting (lukisan), be painted with
berukirkan have as carvings (ukiran)
berikutkan have as a following attachment (ikutan), be
followed by
bercoretkan have as graffiti (coretan), be scrawled with
Such formations are fairly productive in the modern language
and an increasing number are occurring, especially in
journalistic style, which are not included in dictionaries.
The verb bermandikan (peluh/cahaya) 'be bathed in
(sweat/light)' has no corresponding -an noun.
Verbs with prefix ter-1.265 Most ter- verbs fit one of three categories: stative,
accidental, abilitative.
Stative ter- verbs1.266 These verbs refer to a state of affairs. As there is no
action involved there cannot be an actor. They thus contrast
with di- passive verbs which refer to an action. The verbs
diletakkan 'placed (by someone)' and ditulis 'written (by
someone)' refer to actions and can hence take an agent, while
terletak 'situated' and tertulis 'written' refer to the state which
exists following an action:
Koran siapa yang diletakkan di atas meja?
Whose newspaper has been placed on the table?
Koran siapa yang terletak di atas meja?
Whose newspaper is (located) on the table?
Surat itu ditulis(nya) dalam bahasa Inggris.
That letter was written (by him) in English.
Surat itu tertulis dalam bahasa Inggris.
That letter is written in English.
No other affix can cooccur with stative ter-; any affix present
with the corresponding basic verb is deleted, as with -kan in
the first example above. Other examples of stative ter- are:Patung dewa itu terbuat dari emas.
The statue of the god was made from gold.
Pengetahuannya sangat terbatas.
His knowledge is very limited.
Koran ini tertanggal 20 April.
This newspaper is dated 20 April.
All stative ter- verbs correspond to basic passive verbs which
describe the action from which the state results. Other verbs
in this group include:
terkenal well-known
terputus severed, broken off
tertutup shut
tertarik attracted, interested
terbuka open
tersedia available
tercatat noted
tersebut mentioned
terlibat involved
terjamin guaranteed
tercemar polluted
terhormat honoured, respected
Accidental ter-1.267 The word 'accidental is a cover term for a variety of
uncontrolled actions and it is not appropriate in all cases;
depending on the particular verb and the context other terms
may be more appropriate, such as 'unintended, unexpected,
agentless, involuntary, sudden'.
1Verbs in English do not distinguish between accidental and
deliberate action. Thus, 'He left his bag in the library' may
refer to a deliberate act or to an unintended act, usually
context making clear which is meant. In Indonesian the
contrast is usually made explicit. In the following sentences
ditinggalkan 'left' and dijatuhkan 'dropped' refer to
deliberate actions while tertinggal and terjatuh refer to
accidental actions:
Tasnya ditinggalkan di perpustakaan.
His bag was left (deliberately) in the library.
Tasnya tertinggal di perpustakaan.","[139, 140, 141]"
"Thus the word terbuka is usually understood as stative, as in
the first example below, although, depending on the meaning
of the sentence, it can be accidental, as in the second example,
or abilitative, as in the third example:
Pintu terbuka.
The door is open.
Matanya terbuka lebar karena keheranan.
His eyes opened wide with amazement.
Akhirnya pintu itu terbuka juga olehnya.
Finally he did manage to open the door.
Retention and loss of suffixes with ter- verbs1.274 If a basic transitive verb has a suffix this is retained
with an abilitative ter- verb (see 1.272) but usually dropped
with an accidental verb, as discussed in 1.270. Thus,
corresponding to dipikirkan 'thought about' is terpikir
'unintentionally thought' and (tidak) terpikirkan 'can (not) be
thought':
Hal itu belum pernah terpikir olehnya.
That had never entered his mind.
Harapan seperti itu tak terpikirkan oleh ayahnya.
Such a prospect was unthinkable for her father, (literally:
...could not be thought by her father.)
Other forms with ter-1.275 There are many ter- verbs which do not fit easily
into any of the three categories described in sections 1.266 to
1.272. Some verbs like tertawa 'laugh' and tersenyum 'smile'
can be grouped with intransitive accidentals (see 1.268),
indicating action which is considered beyond the control of
the subject. Some words with ter- are not verbs; they belong
to other word classes and in many cases it is doubtful if the
component ter can always be regarded as a prefix in the
modern language. Such words include terlalu 'too',
terlambat 'late', terhadap 'towards', terutama 'especially',
termasuk 'including'.
Verbs with circumfix ke-...-an1.276 With a few exceptions these verbs are adversatives;
they indicate that the subject undergoes an unpleasant or
undesired experience or event.","[146, 147]"
"The following basic clause contains a prepositional phrase as
an adjunct of location (see 2.208):
Di belakang rumah itu ada pohon mangga.
Behind that house there is a mango tree.
This can be embedded in a noun phrase whose head is rumah
'house'. Rumah itu is deleted from the prepositional phrase
and its place taken by -nya:
rumah yang di belakangnya ada pohon mangga
the house behind which there is a mango tree
The preposition may be followed by a longer noun phrase;
the whole of this is deleted from the relative clause as it also
occurs in the embedding phrase. The locative adjunct in the
following construction contains the phrase sebuah grup
vokal 'a vocal group':
Rima juga ikut di dalam sebuah grup vokal.
Rima also participates in a vocal group.
The whole phrase is deleted from the relative clause and
replaced by -nya:
sebuah grup vokal yang di dalamnya Rima juga ikut
a vocal group in which Rima also participates
In such constructions the preposition occurs at the beginning
of the relative clause, immediately after yang. The
preposition involved is usually a locative preposition, as in the
examples above and the first example below. In the other
examples below it is the recipient preposition kepada 'to' and
the benefactive preposition untuk 'for':
meja yang di atasnya tersedia makanan
the table on which food is set
orang yang kepadariya saya mengirimkan surat
' the person I sent a letter to
anak yang untuknya saya membeli kado
the child I bought the present for
Prepositional relative clauses occur infrequently and are likely
to be replaced by defining relative clauses where these can
occur. Thus the last two examples above could alternatively
be expressed:orang yang saya kirimi surat
the person I sent a letter to
anak yang saya belikan kado
the child I bought the present for
Locative relative clauses3.107 These differ from other relative clauses in that they
are not preceded by yang. The more traditional construction
begins with tempat, translated 'where :
Pabrik tempat mereka bekerja tidak jauh dari sini.
The factory where they work is not far from here.
1Although some people still regard this as the only acceptable
form it is more commonly replaced by di mana in the
present-day language:
pabrik di mana mereka bekerja
the factory where they work
On analogy with this form constructions with dari mana
'from where, from which' and dalam mana 'in which' are
becoming more common in journalistic style, although
unacceptable to many people:
pangkalan dari mana roket itu dilepaskan
the base from which the rocket was launched
surat-surat cinta dalam mana dia berjanji akan
mengawini gadis-gadis itu
love letters in which he promised to marry those girls
Bahwa clauses3.108 Any statement can follow bahwa 'that'; these
correspond to 'that' clauses in English. A bahwa clause
behaves like a noun phrase and can occur in a number of
positions where nouns usually occur.
3.109 A bahwa clause can occur within a noun phrase,
modifying the head noun (see also 2.54):
Kabar bahwa gaji pegawai akan naik menggembirakan
kami.
The news that employee's wages would rise delighted us.
Tudingan bahwa Bung Karno terlibat makin santer.","[317, 318, 319]"
"1.236 A small number of per- verbs are based on nouns
and mean 'treat the object as [base]' or 'take the object as
[base]'. Thus memperistri 'take as wife, marry':
Saya tidak dapat memperistri gadis seperti dia.
I can't marry a girl like hen
Other verbs in this group include:
memperbudak enslave; treat like a slave
mempersuami take as husband, marry
memperalat make use of (someone); use as an instrument
mempertuan treat as (one's) master
memperkuda exploit, work (object) like a horse
memperdewa deify, treat like a god, idolise
memperadik regard as a younger sibling
1.237 Per- also occurs with cardinal numbers from 'two' to
'four' to derive verbs meaning 'cause to be so many parts,
divide into so many parts':
memperdua divide into two parts
mempertiga divide into three parts
memperempat divide into four parts
Belonging to this group is memperbanyak 'multiply, increase
the number of:
Mereka memperbanyak senjatanya.
They increased the number of their weapons.
1.238 Two forms occur with verb bases:
memperoleh get, obtain
memperbuat do
Transitive verbs with affixation per-...-kan1.239 This affixation occurs with some adjective bases to
produce causative verbs:
mempermalukan shame, embarrass
memperhebatkan intensify
memperbesarkan enlarge
Where it occurs with adjective bases per-...-kan has the same
meaning as per- (see 1.235). Thus memperhebatkan could
be replaced by memperhebat in the following sentence:Serikat buruh memutuskan untuk memperhebatkan
kampanye.
The trade union has decided to intensify its campaign.
These verbs probably result from confusion between per- and
-kan forms and are not accepted by all speakers. Some, such
as mempermalukan, have wide acceptability and tend to be
included in dictionaries, while others, such as
memperbesarkan, tend to be excluded from dictionaries.
1.240 A very limited number of per-...-kan verbs occur
with noun bases. Some of these are synonymous with
memper- forms. Thus memperdewa, memperdewakan
'deify; idolise'. There is uncertainty about the meaning of two
forms; some people treat m e m p e r i s t r i k a n and
mempersuamikan as meaning the same as memperistri and
mempersuami respectively (see 1.236), while others make a
distinction, memperistri/suamikan meaning 'marry off
(son/daughter), cause (son/daughter) to take a spouse'. The
verb mempermadukan 'take a second wife, provide (wife)
with a co-wife', has no corresponding form without -kan.
Also in this group are the following:
memperdebatkan debate (over)
mempersoalkan dispute, question

1.241 With verb bases per-...-kan has several functions.
With some bases it simply identifies the object as the patient
of the action, being required with those bases to produce wellformed verbs. With some verbs per- is optional; the
corresponding -kan verb has the same meaning. In such
cases both forms are given in the following examples:
Uncertainty as to the meanings of these forms is shown, for
instance, by the two editions of Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa
Indonesia. The first edition (1988. 115) gives memperistrikan
and mempersuamikan different meanings from memperistri
and mempersuami respectively. The second edition (1993: 138)
gives the forms with and without -kan as having the same
meanings, the suffix simply being optional.","[127, 128, 129]"
"locative preposition A preposition indicating position or
direction. The three locative prepositions are di 'at', ke W and dari'from'.
relation to the speaker. The locativc pronouns are sini 'here (near
speaker)', situ 'there (not far off)\ and sana 'there (far off)',
locative relative clause A relative clause indicating location and
preceded by tempat or di mana 'where', rather than by yang, such
as (pabrik) tempat/di mana mereka bekerja '(the factory)
where they work'.
main verb The verb in an independent clause which occurs with a
subordinate clause or complement. It is called the main verb to
distinguish itfromthe verb in the complement or subordinate clause,
measurement noun A noun which refers to size, distance, volume,
speed, weight or temperature. Such a noun is always preceded by a
number, as in dua kilo 'two kilos'. A number plus measurement
noun frequently precedes a noun to indicate an amount: dua kilo
beras 'two kilos of rice',
modal A word in the predicate which refers to concepts like
possibility, ability and necessity, such as dapat 'can' and harus
'must'.
modifying adverb An adverb which occurs with an adjective to
show the amount or intensity of the quality indicated by the
adjective, such as sangat 'very', terlalu 'too',
modifying noun A noun which follows another noun to give more
specific information about it. Thus buku 'book' modifies toko
'shop' in toko buku 'book shop',
modifying verb A verb which follows a noun to give more
specific information about it. It usually indicates what the thing is
used for. Thus tidur 'sleep' modifies kamar 'room' in kamar
tidur 'bedroom'.
mood This refers to the basic reason for the utterance of a sentence.
The four moods recognised here are statements, questions, orders
(imperatives), and exclamations,
negation Turning a construction into a negative by adding to it one
of the negative words. See negative,
negative A word, sometimes also called a negative word, which
negates a construction. The major negatives are tidak 'not', bukan
'not', jangan 'don't'. The term is also used to refer to a construction
which is negated, that is, which contains a negative. Thus a clause
containing tidak is a negative clause,
nominalisation Turning a word or construction into a noun,
nominalised adjective of measure An adjective of measure
which is used as a noun, such as berat 'heavy' in berat saya 'my
weight'. See also adjective of measure,
nominalised clause A clause acting as a noun,
nominalised relative clause A relative clause which takes the
place of a noun when the noun it would usually follow is omitted.
Thus the relative clause yang biru in the noun phrase mobil
locative pronoun A pronoun which indicates position withyang biru itu 'that blue car' is nominaliscd when mobil 'car' is
omitted, as in Yang biru itu mobil saya 'That blue one is my
car'.
non-count noun A noun which refers to something which cannot
be counted, such as air 'water', gula 'sugar'. It cannot be preceded
by a number or classifier or be reduplicated to indicate plurality,
noun A word which refers to a person, thing or abstract concept,
noun clause A clause whose predicate centre is a noun, such as Dia
guru 'He is a teacher'. The negative in a noun clause is bukan,
noun complement A complement which is a noun. Thus,
menjadi 'become' has as a complement the noun presiden in Dia
menjadi presiden 'He became president',
noun phrase A sequence of words which functions in the same way
as a noun (for instance, as the subject or object of a clause) and
which has a noun as its head word,
nuclear component A word or phrase which is obligatory to a
particular clause type. A predicate is nuclear to all clause types.
Most clauses also require a subject and some must have an object or
a complement. Components of a clause which are not nuclear are
called adjuncts.
number pronoun One of a limited number of definite or indefinite
numbers which can stand alone in place of a noun, such as keduaduanya 'both of them' and semuanya 'all of them',
object The noun or noun phrase which occurs immediately after an
active transitive verb. It usually indicates the patient of the action
but with some verbs it identifies the beneficiary or recipient. The
object noun phrase becomes the subject when an active clause is
transformed into a passive construction,
object complement A complement which follows the object in a
transitive clause. The object usually stands as subject of the object
complement. In the following construction the object complement
is pergi 'go'; anaknya 'his child' is simultaneously object of the
main verb and subject of the complement: Dia menyuruh
anaknya pergi 'He ordered his child to go',
object topic-comment clause A topic-comment clause whose
topic corresponds to the object in the basic clause from which it is
derived. In the following object topic-comment clause the topic is
surat itu 'that letter': Surat itu, saya belum menerimanya
'(As for) that letter, I haven't received it yet',
object topic-comment relative clause A topic-comment
relative clause whose topic derives from the object of a basic clause,
its place in the original clause being marked by -nya, as in senjata
yang tidak setiap musuh bisa menghadapinya 'weapons
which not every enemy can face',
ordinal number A number which indicates where something comes
in a sequence and has the prefix ke-, such as kedua 'second',
kelima fifth'.","[20, 21, 22]"
"When asking this the questioner assumes not only that Andi
will go visiting but also that he will go to more than one place.
A typical answer might thus refer to a number of places:
Dia akan berkunjung ke Aceh, Medan dan Palembang.
He will visit Aceh, Medan and Palembang.
The following examples illustrate the other common phrases
in this group:
Apa saja yang dibeli ibu di pasar?
What things did mother buy at the market?
Pertunjukan apa saja yang dapat ditonton di sana?
What shows can be seen there?
Anda ingin bertemu dengan siapa saja?
Which people do you wish to meet?
Anda membaca surat kabar yang mana saja?
Which newspapers do you read?
Mahasiswa itu berasal dari mana saja?
Which places do those students come from?
Questions with -kah
4.23 A sentence can be overtly marked as a question by
use of -kah. It is always optional and is largely confined to
writing and formal speech. The element to which -kah is
attached is placed first in the question. -Kah can occur in
both yes-no and specific questions.
-kah in yes-no questions4.24 If apa is present -kah attaches to it:
Apakah dia sakit?
Is he sick?
If apa does not occur -kah attaches to another word within
the clause. This is usually the predicate centre:
Sakitkah dia?
Is he sick?
Jatuhkah dia?
Did she fall?
If the predicate centre is a phrase, for instance an adjective or
locative phrase, or if the predicate phrase contains timemarker, modal or negative, -kah can attach to the final word
of the phrase, the whole phrase then occurring at the
beginning of the question:
Terlalu gemukkah anda?
Are you too fat?
Sudah pergikah ia?
Has she gone?
If a complement occurs this remains in its normal position:
Maukah kamu ikut?
Do you want to come along?
Tahukah anda mengapa mereka bekerja di sini?
Do you know why they are working here?
Instead of being attached to the predicate centre -kah can be
attached to a time marker, negative or modal to highlight that
this is what is being asked about. If marked by -kah this
word then goes to the beginning of the clause while the rest of
the predicate remains in its usual place. Some other clause
components, including a number of adjuncts, can also be
marked in this way:
Sudahkah hal itu kaupikirkan?
Have you already thought about that matter?
Akankah pertemuannya dengan Presiden Soeharto
batal?
Will his meeting with President Soeharto be cancelled?
Seringkah dia pergi ke sana?
Does she often go there?
4.25 The sentence tag bukan (see 4.9) can take -kah; it
then goes to the beginning of the sentence and carries a tone
of Isn't it the case that...?':
Bukankah dia berasal dari golongan menengah?
Isn't it the case that he comes from the middle class?
Bukankah saudara kaya?
Aren't you rich? (Isn't it the case that you are rich?)
If bukankah occurs in a noun clause it can alternatively be
interpreted as a case of -kah being attached to the negative
within the predicate and not to a tag. This is the only
interpretation if the negative is other than bukan:Tidakkah ini memberikan dampak yang negatif?
Doesn't this give a negative impact?
Specific questions with -kah4.26 In specific questions -kah attaches to the question
word, which comes first in the clause:
Siapakah dia?
Who is he?
Bagaimanakah perahu nelayan itu dapat menemukan
jalan?
How can the fishermen's boats find their way?
Apakah yang dia kerjakan?
What is he doing?
If the question word is part of a phrase the whole phrase
occurs first, with -kah attached to the last word of the phrase:
Pukul berapakah pasawat berangkat?
What time does the plane depart?
Berapa buahkah kamar hotel itu?
How many rooms are there in that hotel? (literally: How
many are the rooms of that hotel?)
If siapa 'who' and apa 'what' occur as object of an active verb
they must come after the verb, in which case -kah cannot
occur. However, the question word can occur first in an
identifying clause (see 3.92) and take -kah:
Anda menemui siapa?
Who did you meet?
Siapakah yang anda temui?
Who did you meet? (literally: Who was the one you met?)
Indirect questions
4.27 A question can be placed within a statement, taking
the place of a noun. Thus the question Kapan dia akan
pindah? 'When will he move?' can occur as the complement
of tahu 'know':
Saya tidak tahu kapan dia akan pindah.
I don't know when he will move.","[347, 348, 349, 350]"
"berteduh, meneduh take shelter
berdengkur, mendengkur snore
berbekas, membekas leave a trace or mark
berdoa, mendoa pray

In a few other cases two forms occur but with a clear
difference in meaning:
tinggal live : meninggal die
pulang go home : berpulang die
lari run, flee, escape : berlari run
Transitive verb affixation1.186 Transitive verbs are inflected for voice; meN- marks
active voice, di- marks passive voice. Voice is discussed in
3.26-40. Under some circumstances these affixes are
omitted, for instance meN- in certain imperative constructions,
di- with first and second person agent. These processes are
described in the appropriate places.
In addition, meN- is usually omitted with a few common
verbs: makan 'eat', minum 'drink', minta 'request', mohon
'request', although affixed forms of these, memakan etc., do
occur. Without the prefix these behave differently from other
transitive verbs in some ways; for instance, they cannot take
bound objects, such as -nya (see 2.71).
The verb mengerti 'understand' is unusual in that the prefix
does not drop in the passive (see 3.27), thus dimengerti
'understood'. Some grammarians account for this by treating
mengerti as not having a prefix, meng being part of the base.
However, the verb was originally based on arti 'meaning' and
meng- is not retained in the presence of circumfix peN-...
-an, thus pengertian 'understanding'. It must therefore be
regarded as a prefix.
In colloquial usage meN- may frequently be dropped,
although consideration of this lies outside the scope of this
work. It is just noted here that the tendency for meN- to bedropped increases as the degree of informality of the speech
situation increases.
5Apart from the above contexts, meN- is predictably present
on active transitive verbs and is consequently omitted from
illustrative examples in some grammar works. However,
because its occurence is required in most natural contexts it is
retained in examples here. That is, the examples are given in
the active voice form of the verb.
Simple transitive verbs1.187 Most simple transitive verbs have verb bases. They
have no affixes other than one of the voice affixes meN- if
active and dl- if passive. There are a great many such verbs
and the following list is far from exhaustive:
membuka open
menutup close
membangun build
mendorong push
memukul hit
memotong chop
membeli buy
menjual sell
menyewa rent
melihat see
mendengar hear
menulis write
membaca read
membawa carry
mengambil fetch
mengangkat lift
menolong help
merasa feel
mencuri steal
memegang hold
1.188 Some simple transitive verbs are based on nouns and
mean 'use [base] on the object, apply [base] to the object'.
Some of these can occur without the object being expressed,
as described in section 3.21.
menyapu sweep
memotret photograph
memborgol handcuff
melap, mengelap wipe
menggergaji saw
Anderson (1983: 6) notes that in a particular survey meN- was
dropped in only 21% of cases when the addressee was a stranger, a
situation in which language is likely to be more formal, but was
dropped in up to 67% of cases when the addressee was a member of
the speaker's family, a situation in which informal style is most
likely.","[94, 95, 96]"
"Nuclear clause components usually have a fixed position in
relation to other nuclear components. When they are moved
from this position attention is focused on them.
Changes from normal word order, or inversion, of nuclear
clause components is discussed in the following sections. A
few cases of word order change are also mentioned elsewhere
when it is necessary in the description of a particular
construction.
Placing the predicate before the subject3.42 The predicate can occur before the subject in a nonverbal clause, such as in a noun clause or adjective clause. In
this case the predicate receives highlighting:
Mahasiswa Unpad dia*
She is an Unpad (University of Padjadjaran) student.
O! Sombong kau, Ki Demang.
Oh! you are arrogant, Ki Demang.
Cantik sekali gadis itu.
That girl is very pretty.
3.43 An intransitive verb can also occur before the
subject. When shifted to pre-subject position a verb freqently
takes foregrounding particle -lah (see 3.51):
Lalu datanglah seorang musyafir.
Then there came a traveller.
Di sini hati saya hancur. Menangislah saya dengan
sangat sedih.
Here my heart broke. I cried very sadly.
The emphasis given to the verb when it is placed before the
subject is to some extent caught by the translation of the first
example above: Datanglah seorang musyafir There came a
traveller , although this device is not always possible in
English.
13.44 A transitive verb, whether active or passive, can also
occur before the subject. A passive verb frequently precedes
its subject to take foregrounding, often with -lah (see 3.51).
Very frequently in such constructions the verb is preceded by
an adjunct, which gives a kind of balance to the construction,the verb still occurring in the 'middle' of the clause. Similar
constructions occur in English:
Di atas gunung telah didirikan sebuah antene raksasa.
On top of the mountain has been built a giant antenna.
Pada hari itu terciptalah suatu negara Indonesia
merdeka.
On that day there was created a free Indonesia.
Such balancing is not, however, obligatory:
Sudah dibuatkan sepatu khusus bagi dia.
Special shoes have been made for him.
3.45 Frequently a long subject is placed after the verb. In
the following example the subject is the noun phrase
beginning with alat-alat and continuing to the end of the
sentence:
Sekarang di toko Tuan Ong tersedia alat-alat yang
menarik perhatian orang desa yang berkunjung ke kota.
Now in Mr Ong's store are available implements which
attract the attention of villagers visiting the town.
In such cases the verb is not placed before the subject for
highlighting, but rather the subject is placed last to avoid a
stylistically clumsy construction.
When the subject is a bahwa clause (see 3.112), an untuk
clause (see 3.115), a supaya/agar clause (see 3.127), a
nominal clause (see 3.143), or an indirect question (see 4.29),
it usually follows the predicate. Such subjects are frequently
long. The placing of such subjects after the predicate occurs
also in non-verbal clauses, as in the last example below. The
occurrence of 'it' at the beginning of corresponding
constructions in English is discussed in section 3.112:
Diputuskan bahwa saya harus dibuang.
It was decided that I must be driven out.
Sulit untuk menurunkan harga.
It is difficult to lower prices.
Diserukan agar dilancarkan aksi-aksi protes
internasional di semua pusat operasi perusahaan itu.
It was urged that international protest actions be launched
in all centres of operation of the company.","[284, 285, 286]"
"See also ellipsis,

first person See person.
focusing adjunct An adjunct which identifies the most important
thing involved in what is being said. There are several types,
including limiters, such as hanya 'only , and additives, such as juga
'also'.
foregrounding A way of highlighting or giving extra attention to a
word or phrase, usually by placing it earlier in a sentence than it
normally occurs.
foregrounding particle A particle which highlights or calls
attention to the part of the sentence to which it is attached. The
particles are pun and (attached to the preceding word in writing) -lah
and -kah.
full reduplication The complete repetition of an entire word,
whether simple, such as buku-buku 'books', or complex, such as
perubahan-perubahan 'changes',
goal See patient.
group number A number which refers to a multiple of ten,
hundred, thousand, etc.
head See head word.
head word The word around which a phrase is built. A noun phrase
always has a noun as its head word. The head word of the noun
phrase mobil besar itu 'that big car' is mobil 'car'. An adjective
phrase has an adjective as its head, and so on.
highlighting See foregrounding.
honorific A form used to show respect. The word sang is an
honorific.
identifying clause A derived clause in which the predicate is
placed first for highlighting and whose subject is a nominalised
relative clause, such as Orang itulah yang mencuri dompet
saya 'It was that person who stole my wallet'.
e m b e d d i n g phrase A noun phrase within which a relative clause1imitative reduplication Reduplication in which the two parts of
the word are similar but not identical, such as sayur-mayur
Vegetables'.
imperative An utterance addressed to someone with the intention
that something is done and said to be in imperative mood.
Imperatives range from strong commands to requests, appeals and
suggestions.
inalienable possession Possession in which the thing possessed
forms part of the possessor, such as mata 'eye' in mata Pak Ali
'Mr Ali's eye'. If something is not inalienably possessed it is
separate from the possessor, such as istri 'wife' in istri Pak Ali
'Mr Ali's wife'.
inclusive first person plural The pronoun kita 'we', referring
to the speaker and the person being spoken to.
indefinite number A number which is not specific, such as
banyak 'many', beberapa 'several',
indefinite pronoun A pronoun which indicates that a person or
thing is being spoken about without a particular person or thing
being identified, such as seseorang 'someone' and siapa saja
'anyone',
independent clause A clause which can occur alone as a sentence,
indirect question A question which is placed within a statement.
Thus the question Kapan dia akan pindah? 'When will he
move?' becomes an indirect question in Saya tidak tahu kapan
dia akan pindah 'I don't know when he will move',
infix An affix which occurs immediately after the first consonant of
a base. Infixation is not productive in modern Indonesian, although
a few fossilised forms remain, such as -em- in gemetar 'tremble'
(cf. getar 'vibrate'),
inflectional affix An affix which does not change the class of the
word. The important inflectional affixes are the voice affixes
meN- and di-. Most affixes in Indonesian are derivational. See also
derivational affix,

surprise or anger,
interrogative See question word,
interrogative mood See question.

refers to an action which involves only one participant, the actor,
such as tidur 'sleep', berjalan 'walk',
linker See sentence linker,
locative A word which refers to place or location,
locative noun A noun which indicates location in relation to the
following noun, such as atas 'top, above' in di atas meja 'on top
of the table'.","[19, 20]"
"I am increasingly convinced of the truth of God's
commandments.
Particle -lah attaches to the first word of the predicate, which
may be a negative, temporal marker or modal:
Dapatlah disimpulkan bahwa serangan itu direncanakan
lama sebelumnya.
It can be concluded that the attack was planned well in
advance.
Tidaklah pantas kalau pemburuan kanguru masih tetap
diizinkan.
It is not appropriate if kangaroo hunting is permitted to
continue.
Particle -lah can also attach to negatives to give emphasis (or
foregrounding), even if the predicate is in its normal position:
Hubungan antara kedua petinggi itu saat ini tidaklah
terlalu baik.
Relations between the two important figures at the moment
are not too good.
Hutan lindung Kapuk bukanlah hutan lindung pertama
yang berubah fungsi.
The Kapuk protected forest is not the first protected forest
to undergo a change of function.
It sometimes also occurs with other words, such as modifying
adverbs, to emphasise them without the predicate being
fronted:
Hubungan Indonesia dan Amerika sangatlah dekat.
Relations between Indonesia and America are very close.
-Lah is never obligatory; it is particularly common in certain
constructions where the predicate typically precedes the
subject, such as identifying clauses (see 3.92) and certain
imperatives (see 4.40), and is discussed separately for such
constructions.
3.52 A predicate marked by -lah does not occur before
the subject if this is marked for emphasis by pun (see
2.22 Iff):Dan penonton menyambut dengan tepuk tangan yang
meriah. Kemudian layar pun tutuplah.
And the audience applauded (our performance) with
cheerful clapping. Afterwards the curtain closed.
Anak-anak mulai bubar. Dan yang tinggal di ruang
kelas enam, tempat kami disunati, hanyalah orang tuatua. Mereka pun pulanglah seorang demi seorang ...
The children dispersed. And only the elders remained in
class room six, where we were circumsized. Then they too
went home one by one ...
3.53 Besides occurring within the predicate -lah can be
attached to a clause adjunct to foreground it. The adjunct
always occurs first in the clause with -lah attached to its last
word. Such constructions are usually translated by cleft
sentences (see 3.92) in English:
Sejak tahun itulah Indonesia secara resmi menjadi
jajahan Belanda.
It was from that year that Indonesia officially became a
Dutch colony.
Beginilah terungkapkan cinta dan kesetiaan terhadap
para leluhur.
In this way can be expressed love and faithfulness towards
the ancestors.
Di desalah terdapat masa depan bangsa kita.
It is in the villages that the future of our people is found.
The verb ada
3.54 Ada is an intransitive verb which differs significantly
from other verbs and deserves special comment. It has a
number of functions.
3.55 In many of its occurrences ada means 'exist :
Tuhan ada.
God exists.
13.56 Very similar to the meaning 'exist' is the meaning
translated by 'there' followed by the appropriate form of the
verb 'to be'. In this construction the subject must follow the
predicate:Ada koran di meja.
There is a newspaper on the table.
Like other verbs, ada can be preceded by negative, temporal
markers and modals:
Di Indonesia tidak ada kanguru.
In Indonesia there are no kangaroos.
Akan ada orang yang berdemonstrasi di luar
kantornya.
There will be people demonstrating outside his office.
When banyak occurs ada is optional:
Tidak (ada) banyak mobil di jalan hari ini.
There aren't many cars on the road today.
This construction also corresponds to English expressions
with 'some (are)':
Ada yang besar, ada yang kecil.
Some are big, some are small, (literally: There are big
ones, there are small ones.)
3.57 In some constructions ada means 'have, own',
occurring with an obligatory complement (see 3.61), which
indicates the thing owned. This function of ada is most
common in colloquial style:
Saya tidak ada uang.
I don't have any money.
3.58 It occurs before the locative preposition di as a
linking verb meaning 'be'. In this context it is optional:
Ayah (ada) di kantor.
Father is in the office.
In this context ada cannot be equated with adalah, which
occurs as a copula before non-verbal predicates (see 3.14),
because ada, unlike adalah, is a verb and can be preceded by
such predicate elements as tidak 'not':
Ayah tidak ada di kantor.
Father isn't in the office.
The verb berada can occur instead of ada in this context:Sekarang kita berada di sebuah desa di Jawa Tengah.
Now we are in a village in Central Java.
3.59 Similar to the construction in 3.58 is occurrence of
ada to indicate that someone has the subject in his or her
possession. The possessor is indicated in a phrase with
preposition pada:
Buku Ali ada pada saya. I've got Ali's book.
3.60 It can occur before a verb as an intensifier; in this
case ada probably cannot itself be regarded as being a verb,
its role being similar to that of emphatic 'do' in English:
Ia ada menerima surat itu.
He did receive the letter.
Adakah engkau merasai perubahan sesudah disunati?
Did you feel a change after being circumcised?
Complements
3.61 A complement is a clause component which
resembles an object but which cannot become the subject of a
passive clause. Complements occur in transitive and
intransitive clauses and also in adjective clauses. A
complement can be an adjective phrase, a noun phrase or a
verbal clause. A complement is almost always obligatory to
the construction in which it occurs. Thus Ibu mulai 'Mother
began' is incomplete because it does not state what mother
began doing. The verb mulai requires a verbal complement:
Ibu mulai berbicara 'Mother began to speak'. Only some
ber- verbs, mentioned in section 3.64, have optional
complements.
For convenience of description, noun and adjective
complements are mentioned in sections 3.62-71, separate
from verbal complements, which are described in sections
3.72-6. Complements introduced by untuk are discussed in
3.77-9, complements introduced by supaya or agar in
section 3.80 and those introduced by sebagai in 3.82-3.
Complements of adjective clauses are discussed separately in
sections 3.83-5.","[289, 290, 291, 292, 293]"
"Ali sold his can
A transitive clause minimally consists of a subject, a predicate,
and an object, as in the above examples. In addition, a
number of adjuncts can occur. In the following construction
an adjunct of time and a recipient occur:
Tahun lalu All menjual mobilnya kepada Hasan.
Last year Ali sold his car to Hasan.
Ditransitive clauses3.20 The object may express one of a number of
participants. In the examples in 3.19 it expresses a patient. It
may also express a beneficiary (see 1.206) or a recipient (see
1.212). In such clauses another noun phrase, the secondary
object, must occur to express the patient:
Mereka mengirimi kami surat.
They sent us a letter.
Ibu membuatkan Siti rok.
Mother made Siti a skirt.
In the above examples the final noun, surat letter' in the first
sentence and rok 'skirt' in the second, is the secondary object.
Clauses which require two objects are usually called
ditransitive clauses. In grammars of English, and in some
grammars of Indonesian, the person who receives (such as
kami in the first example above) or benefits (such as Siti in
the second example above) is usually called the indirect
object, while the patient (surat and rok) is called the direct
object. In this description the noun immediately following
the verb is called the primary object and the other noun is
called the secondary object. As explained in sections 1.206
and 1.229, the clause can be rearranged so that the secondary
object becomes the primary object; in this case the recipient
or beneficiary must be expressed by a prepositional phrase
(see also the examples in 3.17).
Pseudo-intransitive verbs3.21 While most transitive verbs require the object to be
expressed there are some whose object need not be expressed.
The object of such verbs can be omitted when it is obvious or
unimportant, as in:Wendy sedang membaca.
Wendy is reading.
The action expressed by membaca 'read carries over to an
object. However, interest is often on the fact that the action is
being performed rather than on what it is being done to; in
such cases the object is not expressed, as in the above
example. Such verbs are sometimes called intransitive.
However, a real intransitive verb refers to an action which does
not carry over to another person or thing and involves only
the actor, such as tidur 'sleep and berdiri 'stand . Verbs like
membaca 'read' describe actions which have an object, even if
it is not expressed. They are therefore transitive and have a
passive form. Some grammars call them pseudo-intransitive
verbs. A large number of transitive verbs can occur without
an object being expressed, including:
makan eat
menulis write
minum drink
melukis paint
menyapu sweep
menggambar draw
memasak cook
menyeterika iron
mencangkul hoe
menggergaji saw
111All verbs acting in this way are simple transitive verbs (see
1.187). Verbs with affixes per-, -kan or -i cannot omit the
object. Where suffix -kan and -i are optional (see 1.210 and
1.224) only the variant without the suffix can occur without
an object:
Anak-anak sedang menyanyikan lagu.
The children are singing a song.
Anak-anak sedang menyanyi (lagu).
The children are singing (a song).
Kami bisa menyeberangi sungai di sini.
We can cross the river here.
Kami bisa menyeberang (sungai) di sini.
We can cross (the river) here.
In English the list of pseudo-intransitive verbs is longer than
in Indonesian; an English pseudo-intransitive verb sometimes
corresponds to both a transitive and intransitive verb in
Indonesian. Thus pseudo-intransitive 'enter' corresponds to
either transitive memasuki or intransitive masuk:Dia memasuki kamar.
He entered the room.
Dia masuk.
He entered.
Formal distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs3.22 In Indonesian a clear distinction is made between
intransitive and transitive verbs. By its form a verb almost
always identifies itself as transitive or intransitive. Exceptions
are intransitive verbs with prefix meN-, such as menangis 'cry',
which 'look like' simple transitive verbs, and a very few
intransitive verbs which have a suffix (see 3.25). In English
many verbs function both transitively and intransitively. . In
Indonesian this is almost never the case; there is almost always
some difference in form between an intransitive and transitive
verb having the same base. Each (a) construction below is an
intransitive clause; each (b) construction is the transitive
counterpart. The verbs always differ, while in English they do
not:
a. Anaknya mandi.
His child is bathing.
b. Dia memandikan anaknya.
He is bathing his child.
a. Bis berhenti di depan gedung sekolah.
The bus stopped in front of the school.
b. Sopir menghentikan bis di depan gedung sekolah.
The driver stopped the bus in front of the school.
In the above examples the transitive verbs have causative
suffix -kan. Other examples are given in section 1.198. In
some cases transitive and intransitive verbs differ only in their
prefix, the intransitive verb, sometimes indicating reflexive
action, having ber- and the transitive verb having meN-, such
as berubah '(undergo) change' and mengubah 'change
(something)':
Wajah Jakarta sudah berubah.
The face of Jakarta has changed.
Gedung-gedung pencakar langit sudah mengubah wajah
Jakarta.
Sky scrapers have changed the face of Jakarta.","[269, 270, 271, 272]"
"2.41 A possessive noun does not always identify the
owner of the head word; it may identify the originator, creator
or some other relationship. In the following phrase
sastrawan 'man of letters' is the writer of the novel, a
relationship sometimes indicated by 'by' in English:
roman sastrawan ini the novel of/by this man of letters
2.42 Sometimes a possessor is optionally preceded by a
modifying noun (see 2.37) which specifies the particular
relationship between the possessor and head word. The
modifier is not obligatory to the construction. Thus, in buku
ciptaan Pak Sastro the modifier ciptaan 'creation specifies
that Pak Sastro 'Mr Sastro' is the writer of the book rather
than the owner. However, the modifier could be omitted,
resulting in buku Pak Sastro 'Mr Sastro's book', although this
does not explicitly state whether he is writer or owner:
buku ciptaan Pak Sastro
Mr Sastro's book; the book written by Mr Sastro
kios milik Pak Junus
Mr Junus' kiosk; the kiosk owned by Mr Junus
barang buatan Jepang
Japanese goods; goods made in Japan
partai pimpinan Hawke
Hawke's party ; the party led by Hawke
12.43 A ligature dari 'of sometimes occurs between head
and possessive noun, although it cannot occur before a
possessive pronoun:
rumah dari Bu Siti Mrs Siti's house
Use of dari before a possessor is regarded as substandard by
many people. However, it is frequently used if the head word
and possessor are the same or similar:
guru dari guru saya
my teacher's teacher
lukisan dari pelukis-pelukis Italia
paintings by Italian artists
2.44 Also occurring as a ligature before possessive nouns
is -nya:
anaknya guru kami our teacher's childIn this context -nya carries no meaning other than to identify
the second noun as possessor. Its use is particularly common
among speakers of Javanese, in which a similar construction
occurs. It is likely to occur where a kin relationship would be
ambiguous. Thus Ibu Suparjo could mean 'Suparjo's mother
or 'Mrs Suparjo'. With ligature -nya possession is the only
possible meaning:
ibunya Suparjo Suparjo's mother
1Adjectives in the noun phrase2.45 An adjective immediately follows the phrase head:
rumah besar a big house
Adjectives are frequently preceded by yang. The yang plus
adjective construction is actually an instance of a relative
clause (see 3.98). However, because of its frequency it
deserves separate treatment here.
A noun plus adjective sequence forms a close unit, expressing
a single idea without any emphasis on the adjective. Use of
yang separates the adjective from the noun and gives
emphasis to it. This occurs, for instance, when a contrast is
made:
Mereka tinggal di rumah yang besar, bukan rumah
yang kecil.
They live in a big house, not a small house.
If a noun plus adjective sequence is a compound (see 1.32)
yang cannot occur:
rumah sakit hospital
imigran gelap illegal immigrant
Some noun plus adjective sequences are either compounds,
with idiomatic meaning, or genuine sequences, depending on
context. The combination can only be separated by yang if it
is not a compound. Thus:
kamar kecil toilet; small room : kamar yang kecil small
room
orang tua parents; old people : orang yang tua old
peoplemeja hijau law court; green table : meja yang hijau
green table
kambing hitam scapegoat; black goat : kambing yang
hitam black (coloured) goat
If more than one adjective occurs the first may form a close
unit with the noun while the second is preceded by yang:
gadis kuno yang malu-malu
a shy old-fashioned girl
tubuh tua yang ringkih
a frail old body
Coordinated adjectives must be preceded by yang:
anak yang rajin dan pandai
a hard-working and clever child
A sequence of more than two adjectives usually requires dan
'and only before the final adjective:
wanita yang cantik, periang dan cerdas
a woman who is beautiful, cheerful and intelligent
1Yang is obligatory before an adjective phrase (see 2.99ff)
within the noun phrase except that it need not occur before a
superlative adjective phrase with paling or ter- 'most':
gempa bumi terburuk di daerah ini
the worst earthquake in this district
kelompok paling kuat
the strongest group
With other adjective phrases yang is obligatory:
jas yang terlalu besar
a jacket which is too big
orang yang lebih kaya
richer people
As yang actually introduces a relative clause, predicate
elements (see 2.132ff) such as negative and temporal markers
can precede the adjective:
pakaian yang tidak mahal
clothes which aren't expensive
orang yang sudah capepeople who are already tired
Modifying verbs2.46 A modifying verb immediately follows the head
noun and describes what the noun is used for. Verbal affixes
are usually lost:
kamar tidur bedroom
kamar mandi bathroom
meja tulis desk, writing table
mesin ketik typewriter
ruang tunggu waiting room
lapangan terbang aerodrome
Some people retain prefix ber- on a modifying verb; others
regard this as incorrect:
kolam renang/berenang swimming pool
tempat kerja/bekerja work place
Some modifying verbs indicate the process the noun
undergoes:
nasi goreng fried rice
ubi rebus boiled cassava
Attributive verbs2.47 The relationship between the head noun and
attributive verb is that of subject and verb in a clause.
Attributive verbs differ from relative clauses (see 3.98) in two
ways.
First, yang does not precede the verb. Secondly, the
attributive verb, unlike the verb in a relative clause, cannot be
expanded by other clause components, except as indicated
below. Attributive verbs are usually ber- verbs with a noun
base (see 1.169ff). These refer to states or permanent
conditions, not to actions:
kendaraan bermotor motor vehicle
sayur-sayuran bergizi nutritious vegetables
perampok bersenjata armed robbersSome attributive verbs have compound noun bases consisting
of a head noun and a following adjective or number (see
L176):
pesawat berbadan lebar a wide-bodied plane
gedung bertingkat tiga a three-storey building
bocah berusia sembilan tahun a nine year old boy
The noun which forms the base of the attributive verb may be
modified by another noun:
rumah beratap seng a tin-roofed house
kapal berbendera Amerika a ship with an American flag
listrik bertenaga surya solar-powered electricity
The attributive verb may have a noun complement (see 3.64):
pemuda bernama Gaston a youth named Gaston
buku berjudul ""Rajiv"" a book entitled ""Rajiv""
Stative ter- verbs (see 1.266) can also occur in attributive
position:
ujian tertulis written exam
wawancara terpisah separate interviews
Some more or less set expressions also occur attributive to a
noun, such as tak dikenal 'unidentified and tak berdosa
'innocent :
Rumahnya dirampas oleh dua orang tak dikenal*
His house was robbed by two unidentified people,
bayi tak berdosa
an innocent baby
11An attributive verb can always be preceded by yang; in this
case, however, it becomes a relative clause (see 3.98) and is
capable of all the expansion that can occur in such a clause.
Relative clauses in the noun phrase2.48 One way of adding information about a noun is by
placing a clause within the noun phrase; this is called a
relative clause. A relative clause is always preceded by yang.
Relative clauses containing an adjective are discussed in
section 2.45 and other relative clauses in 3.97ff.","[172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177]"
"They are negated by tidak, not bukan:
Dia tidak pemarah.
He's not hot-tempered.
They can follow yang, which is common with adjectives but
rare with nouns (see 3.101):
Dia bukan orang yang pemalu.
She's not a bashful person.
They can be preceded by such modifying adverbs as terlalu
'too', paling 'most', begitu 'so', agak 'rather', and followed by
such adverbs as sekali 'very' (see 2.100):
Pangeran Edward terlalu pendiam.
Prince Edward is too quiet/a too quiet person.
1.121 A few peN- forms based on adjectives do not behave
as described in section 1.120 but act like nouns (see 1.49).
1.122 A few peN- adjectives are based on verbs:
tidur sleep : penidur sleepyhead
menangis cry : penangis cry-baby
lupa forget : pelupa forgetful person
memilih choose : pemilih particular, choosy
These also behave like adjectives, as described in 1.120:
Anda pelupa sekali.
You are a really forgetful person.
Pasar musik Hong Kong sangat pemilih.
The Hong Kong music market is very choosy,
Circumfix ke-...-an1.123 This occurs with a small number of common
adjectives and with banyak and lebih to indicate excess, being
synonymous with terlalu 'too':
kecil small : kekecilan too small
mahal expensive : kemahalan too expensive
manis sweet : kemanisan too sweet
tua old : ketuaan too old
banyak much : kebanyakan too much
lebih more : kelebihan excessive, too muchThis function of ke-...-an is borrowed from Javanese and is
not considered standard by all educated speakers:
Baju ini kebesaran bagi saya.
This shirt is too big for me.
kamu kebanyakan uang.
You have too much money.
1.124 Occurring with a limited number of reduplicated
noun and adjective bases ke-...-an forms adjectives meaning
'possessing to some degree the characteristic indicated by
[base] . It most commonly occurs with colour terms, such as
kemerah-merahan 'reddish':
Warna kemejanya kuning kemerah-merahan.
His shirt is a reddish yellow.
1With noun bases it usually has a negative connotation:
kebiru-biruan bluish
kegelap-gelapan rather dark
kegila-gilaan slightly crazy
kekuning-kuningan yellowish
kebelanda-belandaan westernised (acting like a
European)
keilmu-ilmuan quasi-scientific
1.125 Some speakers allow an unreduplicated base with
colour terms and some other adjectives:
kehijauan greenish
keperakan silvery
kepucatan rather pale
In the case of keemasan 'golden' reduplication of the base
does not occur.
Reduplication does not occur if the base is already
reduplicated:
kanak-kanak young child : kekanak-kanakan childish
laki-laki man : kelaki-lakian mannish (of a woman)
malu-malu shy : kemalu-maluan rather shySuffixes -/, -wi, ~iah1.126 The suffix -i/«wi derives adjectives from nouns. It is
very limited in application, occurring only with some words
borrowed from Sanskrit and Arabic. The variant -I follows a
final consonant and -wi follows a final vowel:
alam the world, nature : alami natural
dunia world : duniawi worldly (hal-hal duniawi worldly
matters)
hewan animal : hewani bestial, relating to animals
Islam Islam : Islami Islamic
manusia human : manusiawi humane
surga heaven : surgawi heavenly
With some words an alternative suffix -iah occurs:
alami, alamiah natural
badani, badaniah physical, bodily
Special forms occur with base bumi 'world : bumiawi 'earthly,
terrestrial', and with roh 'spirit : rohani, rohaniah 'spiritual'.
11Prefix se-1.127 One function of se- is to form adjectives meaning
'sharing [base], having the same [base]', where the base is a
noun. There are two distributions for these forms. They may
occur in a noun phrase, following the noun and preceding a
possessor:
Dia teman sekelas saya.
He is a class-mate of mine,
rekan sekamarnya
his room mate
The possessor may be absent if it is clear from context:
Dia pergi dengan dua puluh delapan orang senasib.
He went with twenty eight people who had suffered the
same fate.
Alternatively, the se-[base] form may occur as a predicate and
be followed by an accompaniment phrase beginning with
dengan 'with' (see 2.210):
Dia sekelas dengan saya.
He's in the same class as me.","[76, 77, 78, 79]"
"part of the possessor. In the first construction therefore the
subject can occur after the predicate. In the second
construction the thing possessed is istri 'wife . However, a wife
is not something inalienably possessed, it is not part of the
possessor; Pak Ali remains the same without a wife.
Consequently the subject of this construction cannot follow
the predicate:
Pak Ali matanya dioperasi.
Pak Ali dioperasi matanya.
Mr Ali's eyes were operated on.
Pak Ali istrinya dioperasi.
Mr Ali's wife was operated on.
16The following examples of topic-comment constructions with
inverted subject and predicate all refer to inalienable
possession:
Mereka itu kolot pikirannya.
Their thinking is old-fashioned.
Dilihat dari bawah, orang itu seperti semut saja
besarnya.
Seen from below, those people look as big as ants,
(literally: ... those people, their size is like an ant.)
Golongan itu bertambah hari bertambah kuat suaranya.
The voice of that group gets stronger by the day.
3.90 The pronouns formed from collective numbers, as in
2.94, and indefinite numbers, as in 2.95, can occur as subject
of a topic-comment construction whose topic identifies the
noun they refer to. Although there is not a possessorpossessed relationship between topic and subject the
construction is based on analogy with the possessor topiccomment form:
Saudagar itu ketiga-tiganya berasal dari Jepara.
' All three of those merchants come from Jepara.
Anak ini semuanya berasal dari Nusa Tenggara.
All of these children come from Nusa Tenggara.
The relationship between alienable and inalienable possession and
the possibility of word order change in such constructions is
discussed by Verhaar (1978)Object topic-comment clauses3.91 These derive from active transitive clauses. The
object of the basic clause goes to the front as topic, while its
place after the verb is taken by -nya. The first clause below is
a basic active construction and the second is the topiccomment clause derived from it:
Saya belum menerima surat itu.
I haven't received that letter yet.
Surat itu, saya belum menerimanya.
Concerning that letter, I haven't received it yet.
The object of an active verb cannot precede the verb (see
3.48). However, in object topic-comment clauses, what was
object in the basic clause, surat itu in the above example, is no
longer object but topic. The object is -nya, which remains
after the verb, allowing the verb to be active. As the above
example shows, the word order in the comment undergoes no
change. For comparison, the passive transformation of the
above basic clause is:
Surat itu belum saya terima.
I haven't received that letter yet.
As with possessor topic-comment clauses, a comma optionally
occurs after the topic in writing. Other examples:
Apa yang terjadi kemudian, anda sendiri mungkin
pernah mengalaminya.
What happened next you yourself have possibly
experienced.
Kebiasaan yang buruk itu susah merubahnya.
That bad habit is hard to change.
Object topic-comment clauses frequently occur as relative
clauses, as discussed in section 3.105.
Identifying clauses3.92 An identifying construction is another method of
focusing attention on a particular element of a clause.
Identifying clauses correspond to what are called cleft
sentences in English, although their structure is quite
different. The following clause is a neutral statement:Orang itu mencuri dompet saya.
That person stole my wallet.
If we want to call attention to orang itu 'that person', to make
it clear that it was he and not someone else who was involved,
we can make it the predicate. The rest of the clause,
beginning with yang, becomes a nominalised relative clause
(see 3.131) and acts as subject. Because the predicate occurs
before the subject it is foregrounded or highlighted (see
3.42-4) and can be marked by foregrounding particle -lah
(see 3.51).
Orang itulah yang mencuri dompet saya.
It was that person who stole my wallet.
Such clauses can be translated by cleft sentences, as in the
above example, or by constructions like 'That person is the
one who stole my wallet'. Identifying clauses are far more
frequent in Indonesian than cleft sentences in English where,
at least in speech, it is more common simply to stress the first
word of the phrase: 'That person stole my wallet'. The
identifying clause in Indonesian is also accompanied by extra
stress on the first phrase. In addition, a rising intonation
identifies the first phrase as the predicate. While
foregrounding particle -lah is common in identifying clauses
it is not obligatory:
Wayang kulitlah yang paling kami gemari.
It is the wayang kulit that we most admire.
Faktor politiklah yang terutama mempengaruhi hukum.
It is political factors which most influence the law.
Hadi yang berangkat tadi.
It was Hadi who left just now.
The predicate can be a personal pronoun or, as occurs
commonly, a demonstrative pronoun:
Inilah yang paling lezat, sehat dan segar.
It is this which is most delicious, healthy and fresh.
As the predicate is a noun phrase it is negated by bukan:
Bukan saya yang selalu terlambat.
It isn't me who's always late.","[307, 308, 309, 310]"
"Suffixes -kan and -/ compared1.229 Many verbs can take both -kan and -i, usually with a
clear distinction in meaning, -kan marking the object as
patient and -i marking it as location or recipient (see 3.17).
The -i verb may be ditransitive (see 1.221) or have only a
single object (see 1.222):
Mereka menawarkan bantuan kepada saya.
They offered help to me.
Mereka menawari saya bantuan.
They offered me help.
Buruh itu memuatkan beras ke kapal.
The workers loaded the rice onto the ship.
Buruh itu memuati kapal dengan beras.
The workers loaded the ship with rice.
Sopir memasukkan mobil ke dalam garasi.
The driver put the car into the garage.
Mobil memasuki garasi.
The car entered the garage.
Not all verbs with verbal bases take both suffixes. Many
verbs, including menyewakan lend , have no corresponding
-i forms:
Parno menyewakan rumahnya kepada keluarga Sugito.
Parno rented his house to the Sugito family.
1There is no -kan form corresponding to a number of -i verbs,
such as menghiasi 'decorate :
Dia menghiasi kamarnya dengan bunga.
She decorated her room with flowers.
11.230 With a number of words the distinction between
-kan and -i is blurred in common usage.
In some cases both -i and -kan occur with the same meaning.
With some there is a recipient or locative object, while with
others the object is the patient:
menamai, menamakan name
mengenai, mengenakan subject to
mengingini, menginginkan desire
menyakiti, menyakitkan hurtmenyembahyangi, menyembahyangkan pray over,
conduct service for
mendoai, mendoakan pray for
menghamili, menghamilkan make pregnant
Mereka menamai/menamakan anaknya Ali.
They named their child Ali.
Goenawan dikenai/dikenakan skorsing dua tahun.
Goenawan was subjected to a two year disqualification.
With these words both forms are generally acceptable.
Nevertheless, there is a considerable amount of confusion in
the minds of many people as to which suffix is appropriate
with certain verbs. Typical is the use of menugaskan instead
of menugasi 'assign', literally 'give tugas (duty/assignment)
to'. While purists insist on the -i form, use of -kan is
common, even among educated people:
Mereka menugasi/(menugaskan) dia mengadakan
observasi.
They assigned him to carry out observations.
9In the active, but not in passive voice, memberikan
commonly occurs with a recipient object, although in this
case also purists regard the -kan form as ungrammatical:
Ibu memberi/(memberikan) anaknya baju baru.
Mother gave her son a new shirt.
In the case of memberikan and mengenakan, referred to
above, purists accept only a patient object:
Ibu memberikan baju baru kepada anaknya.
Mother gave a new shirt to her son.
Skorsing dua tahun dikenakan pada Goenawan.
A disqualification of two years was applied to Goenawan.
1.231 Some -kan verbs have a recipient or locative object.
Reference is made in section 1.197 to -kan verbs having a
locative meaning with emotive adjective bases, such as
This has prompted a number of grammarians, such as Badudu (1983*
45-6), to discuss the 'correct usage of m e n u g a s i and
menugaskan, the latter being acceptable only with an object
identifying the patient.
1mencemaskan 'be apprehensive about'. In such cases an
intransitive emotive verb plus preposition (see 1.219)
corresponds to a -kan transitive verb rather than an -i verb:
bangga akan, membanggakan 'be proud of.
1.232 Occurrence of -i where -kan would be expected is
rarer (see also 1.216). The -i form mengantongi (uang)
'pocket (money)' has a patient object (compare
memenjarakan (penjahat) 'jail (a criminal)'). Many people
use menakut-nakuti (anak) (with obligatory reduplication)
'frighten (a child)' instead of menakutkan, although others
also recognise menakuti 'fear' with a locative object.
1.233 With some verbs acceptability of forms differs
between active and passive constructions. This is discussed in
section 3.35.
Transitive verbs with prefix per-1.234 Prefix per- can occur alone or in combination with
-kan and -i. Examples are given in the active voice, with
prefixation m em per-. Verbs formed with the combination of
per- and -kan are discussed in sections 1.239-44; those
formed with per- and -i are discussed in section 1.245.
1.235 Per- can occur with adjective bases to form causative
verbs. It is sometimes stated that such verbs differ from
causatives with -kan (see 1.192) in that with -kan the object is
caused to take on a characteristic it did not previously have,
while with per- the object already has the characteristic and is
caused to have it in greater degree. Thus from besar 'big' is
derived membesarkan 'make big something which is not big'
and memperbesar 'make bigger something which is already
big'. Other people recognise no contrast between the two
affixes, regarding per- verbs simply as indicating that the
object is caused to have the characteristic of the base, whether
it already had the characteristic to some degree or not. It is
probable there is considerable variation in usage between
different speakers, with many people making no distinction
between the functions of the two affixes. Causative verbs with
per- include:
memperkecil reduce, make small (kecil small)mempercepat speed up (cepat fast)
memperkuat strengthen (kuat strong)
mempersempit make narrow (sempit narrow)
memperpanjang extend, make longer (panjang long)
mempermudah make easy (mudah easy)
memperkaya enrich (kaya rich)
memperlemah weaken (lemah weak)
Affixes per- and -kan cannot always substitute for each other
with adjective bases. Thus memperpanjang 'lengthen/extend
(the time of the object) , as in memperpanjang visa 'extend a
visa' and memperdalam 'deepen', as in memperdalam
pengetahuan 'deepen knowledge', cannot be replaced by
memanjangkan 'lengthen' and mendalamkan 'deepen'
respectively, which apply only to physical objects.
1With some bases one affix or the other does not occur or is
very infrequent. Thus memperkaya 'enrich' is common while
it is doubtful if many people use mengayakan. Only
memperindah means 'beautify', mengindahkan, meaning 'pay
attention to', having a different base. While per- is less
frequent with most bases than -kan it is nevertheless
productive and can occur with new adjectives, such as canggih
'sophisticated', a word which was introduced in the mid 1980s:
Negara-negara Asia mencoba mempercanggih
kemampuan militernya.
The Asian countries are trying to make their military
capability (more) sophisticated.
10To produce causative verbs per- occurs only with adjective
bases, not with intransitive verb bases. Thus there is no perform corresponding to - k a n causatives such as
membangunkan 'wake (someone) up' and memandikan 'bath
(someone)'.","[123, 124, 125, 126, 127]"
"Among other words which can function as both preposition
and conjunction are:
sebab because
sebelum before
sesudah after
sehabis after
selama during
dengan by means of, with
2.128 Not all Indonesian prepositions consistently translate
one English preposition. The preposition terhadap illustrates
the variety of correspondences which might occur. This does
not result from any vagueness in the meaning of terhadap;
the meaning 'directed at' is discernible in all these contexts:
sangsi terhadap orang yang melanggar kebiasaan
sanctions against people who violate custom
sikapnya terhadap tamu-tamunya
his attitude to/towards his guests
jengkel terhadap dirinya sendiri
annoyed at himself
perlakuan Iran terhadap para sandera
Iran's treatment of the hostages
berminat terhadap sejarah
interested in history
perang terhadap perjudian
war on/against gambling
kemenangan terhadap Jepang
victory over Japan
kebencian terhadap mereka
hatred of/towards them
2.129 The preposition oleh 'by' marks the agent of a
passive verb (see 3.27) and the agent attribute in a noun
phrase (see 2.53). It can sometimes follow an intransitive
verb, in which case it can be regarded as a contraction of oleh
karena 'as a result of, because of :
Ratusan juta orang akan tewas oleh ledakan, radiasi,
wabah penyakit dan kelaparan.
Hundreds of millions of people will die as a result of
explosions, radiation, epidemics and hungerIt can sometimes occur with an adjective predicate, being
synonymous with dengan 'with':
Stadion penuh sesak oleh orang yang datang untuk
menonton pertandingan.
The stadium was packed with people who had come to see
the match.
If, however, dengan indicates instrument or means oleh
cannot alternatively occur:
Mereka bepergian dengan kapal laut.
They travelled by ship.
2.130 A number of intransitive verbs take a following
preposition, being equivalent in meaning to transitive verbs
with suffix -i. These are further discussed in section 1.219.
With some of these verbs there is considerable freedom as to
which prepositions it can take. In particular, akan and pada
are frequently interchangeable. The following are some
examples:
cinta akan/pada love
percaya akan/pada believe in
kenal akan/dengan know, be acquainted with
curiga akan/pada/terhadap be suspicious of
Colloquially sama can replace all the above prepositions.
2.131 The preposition antara 'between' may be followed
by coordinated noun phrases, in which case dengan is usually
the coordinator. Examples are given in section 2.207.
THE PREDICATE PHRASE2.132 The predicate is the essential component of every
clause (see 3.4). A predicate phrase contains an obligatory
predicate centre, which is a verb or one of a number of
phrases, including noun phrase, adjective phrase, and
prepositional phrase. The predicate centre determines the
type of clause, as discussed in section 3.4.","[220, 221, 222]"

"A negative response to a positive question is with the
appropriate negative word:
Q: Anda sudah makan?
Have you eaten yet?
A: Belum.
Not yet.
If a yes-no question contains a negative it is agreed to by a
positive response, such as ya 'yes , betul 'correct', where 'no'
would occur in English. In a full response this is then
followed by a sentence containing a negative:
Q: Anda tidak minum kopi?
You don't drink coffee?
A: Ya, (saya tidak minum kopi).
No, (I don't drink coffee).
Q: Kamu belum mengisi formulir, bukan?
You haven't filled in the form yet, have you?
A: Ya, (saya belum mengisi formulir).
No, (I haven't filled the form in yet).
1Although a tag question is always formed with bukan, a
negative response uses the appropriate negative word, bukan
if the predicate is a noun, belum if the predicate contains
sudah, and tidak elsewhere:
Q: Anda lapar, bukan?
You're hungry, aren't you?
A: Tidak.
No.
Specific Questions
4.14 These questions do not seek 'yes' or 'no' as an answer
but require specific information. Specific questions contain a
question word, or interrogative, corresponding to one of the
'wh-' words in English. These are:
apa what
siapa who
(di/ke/dari) mana where (at/to/from)
(yang) mana which
kapan, bila when
apabila, bila(mana) whenbagaimana how
berapa how many, how much
keberapa which number
mengapa, kenapa why
untuk apa why, what for
Specific questions usually have the same word order as
corresponding statements. In the sentences below apa and
siapa are objects. Both occur after the verb, in the normal
position for an object in a statement. In English the question
word must be placed first in the sentence:
Anda membaca apa?
What are you reading?
Dia menemui siapa?
Who did he meet?
However, if the question word is predicate it often precedes
the subject (see also examples at the end of 4.16):
Siapa dia?
Who is he?
Bagaimana jalan itu?
What is that road like?
Siapa and apa4.15 These are interrogative pronouns, occurring in the
same positions as nouns. They can thus occur as components
of a clause, as in the first two examples in section 4.14.
They can also occur within a noun phrase. Modifying a noun
apa asks 'what':
Buku/hari/film apa ini?
What book/day/movie is this?
As a question word apa must be distinguished from the
question marker discussed in section 4.7.
Following a noun siapa is possessive, meaning 'whose':
Anak siapa ini?
Whose child is this?","[341, 342, 343]"
"Lain means 'other' in a contrastive sense. That is, 'other,
something or someone different':
Kita harus menghormati hak orang lain.
We must respect the rights of other people.
Lainnya means 'other' in the sense of 'something extra,
something or someone in addition':
Selama di Amerika dia disertai isterinya, anak-anaknya
dan beberapa orang lainnya.
While in America he was accompanied by his wife, his
children and several other people.
Both lain and lainnya can be preceded by yang, in which
case they are treated as relative clauses (see 3.98).
Attributive nouns in action noun phrases2.53 Action nouns can be followed by attributive nouns,
which do not occur in other types of noun phrase. While
these attributives bear a relationship to possessive nouns they
require special treatment. They differ from modifying nouns
(2.37) in that they can themselves be full noun phrases and
can be preceded by a preposition.
Action nouns usually have affixation peN-...-an (see 1.87)
but some have -an (see 1.62) and some have other affixes or
are affixless. An action noun always relates to the meaning of
a transitive verb; thus pembunuhan 'killing, murder' relates to
membunuh 'kill'.
The attributive noun can relate to the head noun as either
actor or patient of the corresponding verb (for a discussion of
'actor' and 'patient' see section 3.17). The relationship may be
ambiguous:
pembunuhan pemilik toko
the killing of the shop keeper
Here it is not clear (out of context) whether the shop keeper
performs the action (the actor) or is affected by the action
(the patient). Thus the above phrase may derive from either
of the following constructions:
Pemilik toko membunuh.
The shop keeper killed (someone).","[180, 181]"
"Ke-...-an nouns are sometimes used instead of nominalised
measure adjectives even where there is a possessor (see also
3.138). The nouns kedalaman 'depth' and kecepatan 'speed'
frequently occur in such contexts:
Kedalaman/dalamnya sungai ini tiga meter.
The depth of this river is three metres.
Kecepatan/cepatnya mobil itu seratus kilometer per jam.
The speed of the car was one hundred kilometres per hour.
However, the two forms sometimes differ. Thus ketinggian
'height' refers to how far above the ground something is:
ketinggian pesawat itu 'the height of that plane (i.e. how high
it is flying)', while tingginya 'height, tallness' refers to the
measurement of something from its base to top.
Simple nominal clauses3.143 Intransitive verbs and transitive active verbs can be
used as nouns meaning 'the general activity denoted by the
verb'. In grammars of English these are usually called
gerunds, verbal nouns or nominal '-ing' clauses. They can
occur as subject of a clause:
Berenang sangat baik untuk kesehatan.
Swimming is very good for the health.
Mengarang ialah seni.
Writing is an art.
While a verb is often nominalised alone, as in the above
examples, other clause elements can occur with it. However,
because the nominalised verb refers to activity in a general
way it cannot have a subject. An object can occur, although
this cannot be a definite noun:
Mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah.
Finding work in the city is not very easy.
Mengumpulkan perangko kesukaannya.
Collecting stamps is his hobby.
Membersihkan rumah tidak boleh dilalaikan.
Cleaning the house cannot be neglected.
Besides components of the original clause nothing can occur
within the noun phrase with a nominal clause except the
demonstrative itu, which occurs when all instances of theaction are referred to; it also has the effect of identifying the
verb as nominal (see 2.7):
Lari itu sehat.
Running is healthy.
As mentioned in section 3.115, deletion of untuk results in a
simple nominal clause, although not all simple nominal
clauses can become untuk clauses.
3.144 In all the examples in section 3.143 simple nominal
clauses occur in subject position. A simple nominal clause
can also occur as predicate, in which case it is usually
preceded by copula adalah or ialah (see also the first
example in 3.6):
Tugas saya adalah menjual koran.
My task is selling newspapers.
Kesenangan kami ialah bermain sepak bola.
Our favourite pastime is playing soccer.
That the verb is here acting as a noun is shown by the fact that
the predicate is equated with the subject and is negated by
bukan. When the predicate is negated a copula rarely occurs:
Kegemaran saya bukan memelihara binatang.
My hobby is not looking after animals.
3.145 Secondary verbs of the type jahit-menjahit
'everything to do with sewing' are always nominalised; these
are discussed in section 1.252.","[334, 335, 336]"
"NUMBERS AND NUMBER PHRASES2.106 Numbers are either definite or indefinite. The
position of numbers within noun phrases is discussed in
sections 2.14-20. In the following sections the internal
structure of numbers is discussed. The only definite numbers
discussed here are cardinal numbers (see 2.107-12). Derived
numbers are described in sections 1.145-63.
Cardinal numbers2.107 Cardinal units are:
satu one
dua two
tiga three
empat four
lima five
enam six
tujuh seven
delapan eight
sembilan nine
Group numbers are:
puluh tens
belas teens
ratus hundreds
ribu thousands
juta millions
milyar billions
Group numbers combine with one of the units. 'One' is seexcept that with juta the full unit satu can occur and with
milyar it must occur:
sepuluh ten
seribu one thousand
sejuta, satu juta one million
satu milyar one billion
Otherwise a full unit precedes the group number:
dua puluh twenty
tiga belas thirteen
empat ratus four hundredSmaller numbers are expressed after larger numbers:
dua puluh satu twenty one
seratus lima puluh one hundred and fifty
dua ribu enam ratus tiga puluh sembilan
two thousand six hundred and thirty nine
When numbers are written with Arabic numerals a full stop,
rather than a comma, is used to mark off each three placings:
1.000 (seribu) 1,000
2.300.000 (dua juta tiga ratus ribu) 2,300,000
2.108 Fractions (see also 1.149) follow full numbers:
satu setengah one and a half
dua sepertiga two and a third
lima dua pertiga five and two thirds
Saya sudah membaca dua setengah halaman.
I've read two and a half pages.
2.109 In decimal numbers koma 'comma , equivalent to
'point' in English, and represented in writing by a comma,
precedes the numerator:
dua koma tiga (2,3)
two point three (2.3)
satu koma satu juta (1,1 juta)
one point one million (1.1 million)
12.110 'Nought, zero' is nol, although in reading out lists of
numerals, such as in telephone numbers, many people use
kosong:
tiga nol dua/tiga kosong dua
three o two/three zero two (302)
2.111 Arithmetic phrases consist of two cardinal numbers
separated by a word indicating an arithmetic operation:
enam tambah dua six plus two
sepuluh kurang lima ten minus five
tiga kali dua three times two
enam belas dibagi dua sixteen divided by two
Such phrases frequently occur as subject of a clause with
sama dengan 'equals' (see 3.13).","[211, 212, 213]"
