"4. Functions of the cases
4-1. Core cases
4.1.1. Introduction
The Yukaghir system of distinguishing the core participants, i.e.,
the single argument of an intransitive verb (S), the agent (A) and
the patient/theme (O) arguments of a transitive verb, is complicated by the following major factors:
1. The Focus marking by means of the Predicative case, which
is compatible with S and Ο arguments only (Jochelson 1905),
see 4.1.3.18
2. The Nominative marking of third person participants under
the condition that A is first or second person (Jochelson 1905;
Krejnovich 1982:253), see 4.1.2.
3. The effect of person hierarchy and referentiality on the case
marking (cf. Krejnovich 1982:232ff), see 4.1.3-4.1.6.
The functions of cases involved in the system are preliminarily
represented in Table 12. The class of nominal phrases conventionally referred to as ""third person Anaphoric"" here comprisesFunctions of the casesTable 12. Case marking of core participants

noun either contains a bound Possessive marker or is modified by
a possessive pronoun, cf. Krejnovich 1982:260-261).
This section describes and exemplifies the functions of the Nominative, Predicative, and Accusative cases, as well as the patientmarking function of the Instrumental. For further discussion of
the case marking system, see 9.1.
4.1.2. The Nominative case
The Nominative noun phrase represents the S participant (154),
the A participant (155), or the Ο participant. The latter use is
possible if A is 1 st or 2nd person (156) and in a non-finite clause
(157).19

The Nominative is used with Possessive noun phrases (158), proper
nouns (159) and third person pronouns (160) in the predicative
function (158) and in the Focus function (159), (160) (see Chapter
12 for further details on these syntactic functions).

Morphology of closed classes
1. Pronouns
1.1. PersonalpronounsThe paradigm of personal pronouns is given in Table 17.
1.1.1. The case paradigm
Personal pronouns are inflected for case according to the general
rules of nominal inflection, with only some minor differences:
1. The Instrumental case is not attested. 34
2. The first and second person pronouns have the Pronominal
Accusative form (see 5.4.1.5, 0.1.1). The Nominative form of
the third person pronouns has the same formal marking (-/)
as the Pronominal Accusative.
3. For the third person pronouns, the Nominative and the Possessive forms are formally distinguished, while the first and
second person pronouns are used as the Possessive modifiers
in their Nominative form, i.e., like nouns (5.4.1.2, 8.2.1); see
1.1.2.

the nominal paradigm:
• Free Possessive form ('mine', 'yours', etc.); see 1.1.3
• Intensified form ('self'); see 1.1.4.
5. The third person pronouns belong to the class of Anaphoric
noun phrases, i.e., they do not attach the Predicative marker
and take the Nominative form in the predicative function and
and in the Focus position (see 5.4.1.1, 5.3.1.2).
Table 18 gives illustrative paradigms for the LSG, 2PL, and 3SG
pronouns. The inflection of the other three pronouns is completely
analogous.
1.1.2. The Possessive form
The Possessive form is used for possessive modifiers. The Possessive third person pronoun can be used only reflexively, that is,
when the Possessor is coreferential with the subject of the clause
(437a)-(437b); otherwise, the morphological Possessive marking is
used (see 5.2). The first and second person pronouns are used in
both environments (437c)-(437d).","[249, 250, 251, 252]"

Syntax of the clauseThis chapter discusses the case marking of the core participants
in finite (1.1) and non-finite (1.2) clauses. The most remarkable feature of case marking in Yukaghir is the extensive employment of the well-known affinities between the core participant roles
and pragmatic (or information-packaging) properties of NPs (1.3).
Section 1.4 provides summaries of syntactic properties which may
serve to identify the grammatical relations of subject, direct object
and indirect object.
The most frequent word order is verb-final, yet the relative
order of constituents is largely determined by their pragmatic roles
(1.5).
Verb valence patterns are described in section 2. Section 3
provides an overview of clausal adjuncts.
1. Core participants and grammatical relations
1.1. Finite clauses: summary of case marking
1.1.1. Transitive finite clauses
The primary participant of the transitive finite clause (A) takes
the Nominative form 50 and controls the agreement marking on the
verb (see 5.4.1.2, £.1.1.2); it is easily dropped when recoverable.
The secondary participant (O) lacks a uniform case marking; the
following options are available:
1. Predicative marking. The Ο participant can be marked as
the Focus, which entails the choice of the OF paradigm for326Chapter 9. Syntax of the clausethe finite verb (see 5.4.1.3, £.1.1.2). The Focus NP cannot be
dropped. The Focus marking ensures the distinguishability of
the participants, insofar as no other participant of a transitive
clause can be marked as the Focus (see 12.2-12.3).
2. Neutral marking. Provided that A is first or second person,
a third person Ο takes the Nominative form (5.4.1.2), a first
or second person O, the Pronominal Accusative form (5.4.1.5,
7.1.1.1). Both in this and in the next case the Ο participant
can be easily dropped if the referent is recoverable from the
context.
3. Accusative marking. If A is third person, a non-Focus Ο
participant takes the Accusative or the Instrumental form
(5.4.1.4, 5.4.1.6).
These marking options are exemplified in the respective sections
on case functions (5.4.1), as well as by many other examples in
this book; for a description of Focus marking, see 12.2-12.3.
Note that the so called ""Anaphoric NPs"" (proper nouns, thirdperson personal pronouns, and Possessive NPs) do not take the
Predicative case form (5.4.1.1, 5.4.1.2). Instead, the Nominative
form is used in all positions where the Predicative case would
otherwise be required. As a result, in sentences like (605) both
core participants are in the Nominative case form. 51
(605) a. tamun-rjin
that-DATtitteu0r-petheir child-PL 0jal-l'el-mele
send-lNFR-OF:3SGcarcaqan-die
C.-DIM a'Charchahan sent their (his and his wife's) children to
bring it.' [F29]
b. tamun-getintaij pulutthat-LOC t h a told.manAejmunde-gitadi-melehalf-POSS 0give-OF:3SG'In response, the old man gave (her) a half of it.' [F15]
c. pon'qonodo saqale-yin
lynx Afox-DATtude masl'u0tadi-melehisgive-OF:3SGdaughterG'The lynx gave his daughter to the fox (as aCore participantsand grammaticalrelations327wife).' [Fl8]
However, such sentences are never ambiguous, since they occur
only if the Ο participant is marked as the Focus and the Focus NP
always takes the preverbal position. Hence, the NP representing
the A participant cannot intervene between the Focus and the
finite verb (see 1.5.1). In addition, the Focus NP (which is implied
by the verb form) cannot be omitted, so that the Nominative NP in
the preverbal position can only be interpreted as the Ο participant.
Thus, it is the grammatical Focus marking (as manifested in the
linearization rules, constraints on pro-drop, and the OF form of
the verb) that is employed to distinguish the core participants in
such clauses.
Terminological note. In the syntactic chapters of this book,
the term ""Predicative marking"" is applied to cases like (605)
as well, that is, I will not make the reservations concerning Anaphoric NPs at all points where Focus marking is
mentioned. Similar terminological conventions are applied
to other case marking options: the term ""Neutral marking""
refers to the second marking option in the list above (Nominative for third-person NPs, Pronominal Accusative for first and
second person pronouns). Thus, Neutral marking is opposed
to Nominative marking, where the Nominative case is used
independently of the person. The term ""Accusative marking""
is applied to refer to the third marking option, independently
of the particular case employed.52
1.1.2. Intransitive finite clauses: split intransitivity
The single core participant of a finite intransitive clause (S) can
either take the Nominative form or be marked as the grammatical
Focus of the clause. The latter option involves the Predicative
marking of the NP (5.4.1.3) and the choice of the SFparadigm for
the finite verb (6.1.1.2). These options are exemplified in 5.4.1.2
and 5.4.1.3. Thus, Yukaghir appears to show a special (""Focusoriented"") case of split intransitivity:53 the S participant takes either Nominative marking (associated with the A participant in a328Chapter9. Syntaxof theclausetransitive clause) or Predicative marking (associated with the Ο
participant in a transitive clause).
These marking properties naturally give rise to the following
question: Which grammatical units (if any) can be associated with
syntactic functions (or grammatical relations), such as subject,
direct object, etc.; in other words, do the participant roles identify
the syntactic functions, or are these functions identifiable only for
a given packaging variant? To put the question straightforwardly,
is it only the Nominative (non-Focus) primary participant (A/S)
that can be identified as the subject of a clause, or is subjecthood
maintained for the Predicative (Focus) S as well?54
The former analysis might appear more plausible not only on
morphological grounds, but also on the basis of functional considerations, inasmuch as some sort of topichood is generally associated with subjects. It appears, however, that Yukaghir grammar assigns the subject properties to the primary participant role
(A/S), be it the Focus or not, rather than to the Nominative (nonFocus) A/S. That is to say, the syntactic generalizations of the
type cross-linguistically associated with ""subjects"" are to be stated
over the participant roles, without regard for the Focus marking.
Various syntactic constructions that substantiate this claim are described in different parts of this grammar; see 1.4 for a summary
of this evidence.
1.2. Non-finite clauses
The case marking of the core participants in non-finite clause differs from that outlined above for finite clauses:
• Focus marking is impossible in non-finite clauses.
• The primary participants of Nominal and Attributive relative
clauses are encoded as Possessive modifiers (see 1.2.1).
• Neutral Ο marking in non-finite clause is compatible with the
third person A participant, under pragmatic conditions which
can be formulated in terms of oppositions between global and
local participants (1.2.2).","[341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346]"
"'What woman would it be?' [F49]
Secondly, the formal opposition in question is employed to express
the distinction between the true predicative and the referential use
of noun phrases. The Predicative noun phrase in -lek ascribes a
property to (i.e., classifies) some entity.In other words, an example
like (165) might be appropriately rendered as 'The thing I will
give to you is a fox'. The variant in -ek signifies the referential use
(i.e., the Focus NP introduces a referential entity); this is shown
by the fact that only this variant can be used if the noun phrase
is modified by a numeral, in particular by the numeral irkin 'one':
(168) a. tatäj[CA C Pqon-de-gecuge-geirk-ingo-3SG-DS] way-LOC one-ATTRsaqale-kqodö-d'e

eagle-owls flew overhead.' [K5]
4.1.4. The Accusative case
The Accusative case is used to mark the Ο participant, under the
condition that A is third person (otherwise the Nominative case
is used, see 4.1.2):
(169) a. colhorä-die-gele
hare-täsasil-getheresnare-LOCi-de-m
get.caught-CAUS-TR:3SG'He caught the hare in the snare there.' [Fl4]
b. titte cül-gele

'They took their meat.' [F48]
c. tet
kimm met-kele kudede-m
your whip me-ACC kill-TR:3SG
'Your whip has killed me.' [F19]
The Accusative marking is compatible with pronouns, proper
nouns, Possessive noun phrases and definite noun phrases (including generic reference, as in (170a)); if a noun phrase is indefinite,
the Instrumental case is used instead (cf. Krejnovich 1982:254-255,
see also Note 21).
There can be two Accusative noun phrases in a clause if some
kind of possessive or part-whole relationship holds between them
(cf. 5.4.2.2 for a designated body-part form).
(170) a. taijparä-getmus'inen-d'5njöbtthat time-ABL various live-SBNR in.foresten-d'ön-geleamun-de-jleomos'live-SBNR-ACC bone-POSS-ACC wellp0m-ija

The Accusative can mark the recipient (171a) and the addressee
(171b), the functions most commonly fulfilled by the Dative case
(see 4.2.1,
(171)9.2.4).a. tabun-pe-gele cumu legul-pe-de-jle

4.1.5. The Pronominal Accusative Case
First and second person pronouns have a special Pronominal Accusative form in -ul (see 7.1.1.1), which is used for the Ο participant under the same conditions as the Nominative form of nouns,
i.e., if A is first or second person (172a)-(172b), or, occasionally,
in non-finite clauses (172c) (cf. 4.1.2).","[110, 111, 112]"

"MorphologyYukaghir is a highly synthetic and essentially agglutinative language; suffixation prevails. There are five prefixes (two prefixes
of polarity, the reflexive, the reciprocal, and the prefix of irrealis);
these morphemes are characterized by a looser connection with
the stem than the suffixes, so t h a t the boundary between a prefix
and its stem may be described as internal open juncture. Fusion
phenomena at morphemic boundaries are marginal.
The m a j o r open classes of lexical items are nouns and verbs;
they can be easily distinguished by morphological criteria. Words
denoting qualities constitute a sub-class of verbs; in the attributive
function, they take the verbal Attributive form (see (5)).
2.2.1. Nouns
Nouns are inflected for number (Singular, Plural), case (Nominative, Predicative, Accusative, Instrumental, Dative, Locative, Ablative, Prolative, and Comitative), and Possession (cross-reference
suffixes for third Person Possessor only). This paradigm is exemplified in Table 2 for the noun ace 'domestic deer'.
The Possessive marker cross-references either the possessive
modifier or a possessor outside the NP. It can be used only for
a third person Possessor t h a t is not coreferential with the subject4Chapter 1.","[21, 22]"
"Core participantsand grammaticalrelations3371.3. ""Pragmatic motivations"" for case marking: summary
There are four alternative mechanisms which are employed to distinguish the core participants of a transitive clause:
1. Focus marking. If the Ο participant is marked for the grammatical Focus, the core participants of the clause are distinguished by virtue of the fact that the A participant cannot
take the Predicative marking (1.1.1). This mechanism can
be viewed as a sort of grammaticalization of the semantic
affinity between the A role and the ""topic"", on the one hand,
and the Ο role and the ""focus,"" on the other. Various reflexes of these affinities are attested in the grammars of many
languages. What may distinguish Yukaghir typologically is
the especially prominent role of this association in the core
clause-internal syntax.
2. Person hierarchy. If the A participant coincides with a speech
act participant and the Ο participant does not, no overt case
marking is needed, i.e., the grammar associates the participants of the speech act with the A role and the third person
with the Ο role. Such affinities are also clearly semantically
motivated and widely attested cross-linguistically. In addition, the agreement marking on the ν erb gives a strong formal
support to this mechanism: the combination of a Nominative
NP and a first- or second-person verb form accepts only the
Ο interpretation of that NP.
3. ""Global vs. local"" opposition. If the A participant of a nonfinite clause represents a more global entity (in the sense of
1.2.2.2-1.2.2.3) than the Ο participant, Neutral Ο marking
is available. This mechanism is not fully grammaticalized.
Presumably, it can be viewed as a manifestation of the textlevel topicality of referential entities.
4. Accusative marking.
These mechanisms constitute a hierarchy: if Focus marking is applied, the person distinction is irrelevant, i.e., this mechanism338Chapter9. Syntaxof theclauseis only employed for non-Focus Ο participants. Similarly, the
""global"" vs. ""local"" status of the Ο participant is relevant only if
the former two mechanisms are inapplicable. Finally, Accusative
marking is employed only if neither of the pragmatically motivated
distinctions is at work.
The pragmatically motivated mechanisms of distinguishing the
core participants can be subsumed under a rather broad category
of (relative) topicality of these participants, which would include
the following ""statuses"" (the least ""topical"" status, the grammatical
Focus, being inaccessible for the A participant):
(618) Speech act participant > Global participant > Local participant > Focus
The general rule for case marking in transitive clauses may be then
formulated as follows: if the A participant is more topical than the
Ο participant (that is, has a higher rank in hierarchy (618)), the
latter need not be marked for the case role.
I.4. Grammatical relations
This section summarizes the syntactic properties which can identify the grammatical relations in Yukaghir. It is shown that the
subject properties in Yukaghir are associated with the primary
participant, independently of the Focus marking. On the contrary,
there are no behavioral properties which would be associated with
the Nominative A/S participant alone (in contrast to the Focus S
participant and other types of constituents, see 1.1.2). On the basis of this evidence, it can be assumed that the syntactic functions
have to be identified on the level of participants, without regard
to Focus marking.
Sections 1.4.2-1.4.3 summarize the syntactic properties which
may distinguish the syntactic functions of direct object (O participant of transitive clause) and indirect object (Dative participant
of ditransitive clause).
All relevant constructions are described elsewhere in the grammar. This section can serve as an index to the respective parts of
the grammar.","[354, 355, 356]"
"587sive and the apposition interpretations, so the reading 'the small goose's
daughter' is also possible.
This formulation does not take into account the possessive use of the
zero marking, since in this case Attributive marking is not an option.
This option was suggested to me by Bernard Comrie.
Note that the Comitative markers in this example introduce the secondary participant of a reciprocal situation (see 9.2.8); two Comitative
participants are conjoined by the connective adverb.
See Note 127.
In this chapter, the core participant roles are shown by indexes A and Ο
in the interlinear gloss unless they are recoverable from the case marking.
See 5.4.1.6 on the semantic difference between the Accusative proper
and the O-marking Instrumental
This phenomenon was described by Krejnovich as ""quasi-ergativity""
(1982:232).
I am grateful to Maria Polinsky for drawing my attention to this issue
many years ago.
A special case not dealt with here is represented by relativization of the
Possessor (see 11.3.1.4 for details).
This meaning is impossible for Nominal clauses, simply because the head
denotes a situation (not a countable referential entity).
Note that this property is similar to topicality in Givon's sense (i.e., topic
continuity and persistence), with the qualification that the structuring
of a text into episodes must be taken into account.
The only exception may be the first and second person pronouns, which
tend to trigger Accusative marking in all instances, see (609a), (612a).
In my corpus, there are no examples of Neutral (= Pronominal Accusative) marking of these pronouns with third-person A. It should be
noted, however, that my informants do rate the Neutral option grammatical in such cases. Apart from this, the Accusative marking of the
first and second person pronouns can be viewed as an instantiation of
the more general rule suggested here, insofar as they tend to refer to the
most prominent entities in any episode they occur.
An entity is taken to ""occur"" in some clause if it is involved in the
situation being described, independently of whether· it is represented by
an overt NP within that clause.
Note that the Accusative NP in such examples may represent the Ο
constituent of the finite clause, cf. ίθ.1.3.1, 10.1.3.3.
This property is shared by the Dative Experiencer as well (see 2.7.1).
To be more precise, there is no convincing way to draw the distinction between a sequence of independent clauses and a sentence built by
juxtaposition of finite clauses.",[605]
"Functionsof the cases914.1.3. The Predicative case
The Predicative noun phrase is the nominal predicate (163) or the
Focus of a clause (Krejnovich 1982: 184; 232ff). Only S (164)
and Ο (165) can acquire the Predicative marking (0.1.1.2; cf. also
Note 18). The Predicative case is incompatible with Possessive
noun phrases, proper names, and third person pronouns, which
take the Nominative case in these functions (see (158)-(160)).

formally distinguished only with vowel-final stems and in the Plural form (see Table 10, 1.4.1). There is a clear functional distinction between these variants which subsumes two interrelated
factors: 20
First, the short variant is used if the narrow information focus
(e.g., the focus of contrast) falls on a modifier, rather than on the
noun phrase as awhole:

The relevance of this factor is indirectly shown by the fact that
only the short variant is possible in question-word questions with
a question word modifying a noun (cf. 12.3.1.1):

"Core participantsand grammaticalrelations3391.4.1. Subject properties (A/S participant)
The following properties are shared by the primary participants
of transitive and intransitive clauses. Some of these properties are
manifested in non-finite clauses, where the Focus marking is not
available; others are insensitive to the Focus S vs. Nominative
A/S distinction, i.e., they are demonstrably valid for both types
of NPs. Hence, all these properties are independent of the Focus
marking.
• The primary participant (A/S) controls the agreement markers on the finite forms (0.1.1), Passive Attributive forms
(5.1.2.3) and DSforms (5.1.4.1.1).
Although in the SF
paradigm the number of opposed forms is severely reduced
(it distinguishes only two forms instead of six, see 5.1.1.1),
the S participant still controls the only remaining agreement
marker (the Plural marker -r/i-).
• The primary participant controls clause-internal coreference
phenomena, i.e., Reflexive and Reciprocal marking (5.4.5)
and the reflexive possessive pronouns (see 7.1.1.2), see also
14.1.1.
• The primary participant is encoded as the Possessor in Nominal and Attributive relative clauses (1.2.1). Consequently, the
choice of the possessive pronoun vs. bound Possessive marking for this participant is controlled by its coreference with
the primary participant of the matrix clause (see 14-1.2).
• The primary participant is obligatorily deleted in the Supine
Adverbial clause (see 11.4.2).
• The primary participant controls the switch-reference markers in clause chains. This appears to be the most significant
piece of evidence in favor of the subjecthood of the S Focus
constituent; indeed, the switch reference seems to be most
liable to be affected by the Focus marking, since it has to do
with referent tracking, hence with topicality. However, this
proves not to be the case: the primary participant controls340Chapter 9. Syntax of the clausethe switch-reference markers independently of whether or not
it is marked as Focus (see 12.2A,
14-1.3.3).
• There is only one, and rather marginal, relation-changing procedure which promotes the Ο participant into the S position,
namely, the Resultative (see 6.3.5.6.2). This procedure does
not interact with Focus marking.
To sum up, despite (or rather independently of) the grammatical
Focus system, Yukaghir appears to be a highly subject-prominent
and role-dominated language, where the primary participant role
(A/S) serves as a major syntactic function (which can be identified
as ""subject"").
1.4.2. Direct object properties (O participant)
The direct object (O participant) can be distinguished from other
objects by the following properties:
• The Ο participant can receive the grammatical Focus (Predicative) marking, which is impossible for other objects.
• The Ο participant can take the Nominative case form (under
the conditions described in 1.1.1, 1.2.2).
• The Ο participant can be promoted to the S position by
means of the Resultative (5.3.5.6.2).
• The coreference of the Ο participant with the A participant
is marked by the Reflexive marking on the verb (see 5.4.5.3,
1.1.1).
• The Ο participant can be relativized (see 11.3 for details).
• The Ο participant can control scalar quantifier floating (see
5.3).","[356, 357, 358]"
"290Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositional phrase2.1. Zero marking: NP M +NP H -CASE
In this construction, the modifier is in the Nominative case; the
head noun is marked for case according to the role of the NP in
the clause.
Instances of this construction fall into two major classes: one
class comprises NPs which invoke two separate referential entities and establish a possessive relationship between these entities
(2.1.1); NPs of the other class invoke a single referent (apposition,
see 2.1.2). A special subgroup of the latter class is formed by NPs
with quantifiers, where a zero-marked modifier expresses a unit of
quantity (2.1.3).
The interpretation of each particular NP is determined, in most
cases, by the lexical meanings of the nouns and/or by the context.
The construction itself is ambiguous with respect to referential autonomy of the modifier; furthermore, in some cases, this ambiguity
remains unresolved (see 2.1.2).
2.1.1. Possessive modifiers
The juxtaposition of NPs can render a possessive relationship (in
a very broad sense) between their referents. The examples below
illustrate the application of this construction to the prototypical possessive relations: belonging (558), part-whole (559), and
kinship (560), as well as to some other relations that may be
accounted for in terms of extension of the possessive prototype

The modifier in a zero-marked construction can have the same
referent as the modified noun; see (563) for proper names as modifiers, (564) for common nouns. In the latter case, the modifier
noun merely signifies an additional property of the entity referred
to by the head noun, yet it may be thought of as an appropriate
referential expression for this entity.

Note that in (564f) the reading 'the child of that bear' is excluded
only by a wider context: the story is about a woman who gave
birth to a bear. The construction itself does not provide any clues
to the intended interpretation.
In some cases, the ambiguity of the construction cannot be
resolved by the context, so that an NP allows both the samereferent (apposition) and the possessive interpretations:

This section is mainly concerned with the factors which trigger
overt Possessive marking, in contrast to the zero marking which
is also available for possessive relations (2.1.1). The Possessive
marking appears to signal that the Possessor (modifier referent) is
accorded a higher degree of clause-level prominence. More specifically, it is conceived of either as the clause-level topic (2.2.2) or
as a participant involved in the situation (2.2.3).
Thus, Possessive marking appears to involve a sort of discrepancy between form and function: semantically, the Possessor is
assigned some clause-level role, while structurally its status as an
NP modifier is maintained. This property of the grammar makes
it possible to use the same morphological device for two essentially different functions, which are kept formally apart in many
other languages, i.e., to subsume topicalization of the Possessor
(information-packaging function) and involvement (situation construal function) under the same category of referential autonomy
expressed by the overt Possessive marker on the head (2.2.1).
2.2.1. Referential autonomy
2.2.1.1. Pronominal Possessive marking. The Possessive marker
on a noun cross-references the Possessor (5.2). The Possessive
markers can be used pronominally, that is, they can replace nominal possessive modifiers. In such cases the entity cross-referenced
by the Possessive marking is represented either by another (nonsubject) element of the same clause or by an element of a preceding
clause. This use is illustrated by the following examples:

(below, internal Possessive marking). In this construction, the
Possessor is represented by an NP in the Nominative form which
immediately precedes the NP bearing the Possessive marker:

'There was a straw in the belly of that mouse.' [Fl 1]298Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositionalphraseThe examples in (558)-(560) and (568) demonstrate that the Possessive relationship between two entities licenses both the zero
marking and the internal Possessive marking (see 5.2 for more examples of the latter option). In other words, if the NP is intended
to invoke two referential entities (i.e., the modifier referent and
the head referent), the speaker is free to choose between these encoding options. The semantic distinction between these options
can be explicated in terms of markedness: the impact of the Possessive marking is to signify that the modifier has a referent of
its own, while the zero option leaves this feature unmarked (see
2.1.2). Thus, the Possessive marking resolves the ambiguity associated with the zero marking.
For instance, in (569a) the Possessive marking precludes the
apposition interpretation (like in (563)), since it signals that the
modifier has a separate referent. The zero marking option would
have allowed both interpretations ('Alandin's servant' vs. 'servant
Alandin'). Similarly, in (569b), the Possessive marking on the head
indicates that the phrase ataqun num0 refers to the specific (previously mentioned) families, while otherwise it would have been
interpreted as an instance of quantification (see 2.1.3):
(569) a. met alandin üjs'i-gi+rjö-d'e
IAworker-POSS+COP-lNTR: lSGΊ am Alandin's servant.' [F50]
b. ataq-un

[two-ATTR house]child-PL-POSSjarqe-lek
ice-PREDcine-nu-ijile
chop-IPFV-3PL:OF'Children of the two families (lit. houses) chopped
ice.' [F55]
The choice between unmarked vs. marked option for encoding of
the Possessive relationship seems to be associated with the degree
of prominence accorded to the modifier referent. Roughly, two
situations are distinguished:
First, the role of the modifier referent in the message can be
reduced to building an appropriate description of the head referentNoun phrases as noun modifiers299(i.e., to serving as the ""reference point"" (Langacker 1993) for its
identification). This situation entails zero marking. Secondly, the
modifier referent can be conceived of as playing some independent
role in the overall information structure of the message (see 2.2.2)
or in the situation being described (see 2.2.3). In this situation,
Possessive marking is likely to be chosen.
Note that this account explicitly relates the internal use of the
Possessive markers to their pronominal use (2.2.1.1): in both cases,
the controller of the Possessive marker has some other function in
the clause or in some higher-level text unit, apart from being the
Possessor for the entity referred to by the head.
Furthermore, this analysis gets indirect support from the Possessive marking of the primary participant in Nominal and relative
clauses (see 0.1.2.1, 11.1). In these constructions, the primary participant is encoded as the grammatical Possessor of the head NP (a
Nominal verb form or the relativized NP, respectively). Although
both zero marking and Possessive marking are available in both
constructions, the latter is applied much more frequently. This
preference is straightforwardly accounted for by the analysis suggested here, insofar as the primary role in the situation signified
by a non-finite clause ensures a higher degree of prominence than
just the function of Possessive modifier.
2.2.2. Topicalization
Many instances of internal Possessive marking involve topicalization of the Possessor, i.e., the clause is construed as being about
the entity cross-referenced by the Possessive marker. Although
identification of a particular clause as an instance of topicalization is often controversial, there are some clear examples which
demonstrate that this factor is in play:
(570) a. tudel

'The bag which lies outside, do not open it and look
(what is inside).' [F19]
In examples like (570) the controller of Possessive marker might
have been analyzed as the ""syntactic topic"", i.e., as a left-detached
constituent resumed by the Possessive marker within the comment,
rather than as a modifier within the clause-initial NP. This analysis
appears to have a number of advantages:
First, it conforms with the syntax of switch reference (i^.1.3.2)
and relativization (ii.3.1.4), insofar as the controller of the Possessive marker can serve as the syntactic ""pivot"" in these construction types. Secondly, this analysis would subsume internal
and pronominal instances of the Possessive marking under a singleNoun phrases as noun modifiers301grammatical category, inasmuch as the controller of the Possessive
markers was to be analyzed as ""external"" in both cases. Finally,
the construction under discussion would be explicitly identified
with structurally and semantically similar ""double-subject"" constructions in topic-prominent languages (Li and Thompson 1976).
However, there seems to be some strong evidence against such
an analysis. In a number of examples, the topic interpretation
does not seem semantically plausible; more importantly from the
structural point of view, the controller of the Possessive marking
need not be clause-initial:
(571) a. terike-gipude[wife-POSS o u t s i d euk-ej-delletowke-lego.out-PFV-SS:PFV]dog-iNSTRulte-mmemecuge-de-getie-TR:3sGbeartrace-POSS-LOC'His wife went outside and fastened the dog on the

that-LOC that.time that earth-ATTR+lord-PL
es'ie-pe-gi
mon-u-l
father-PL-POSS say-O-SF'The father of the former earth lords replied:
<...>' [F9]
See also (569), (574). Thus, the analysis of the Possessor as ""topic""
does not provide a semantically adequate account for all instances
of internal Possessive marking.
In addition, the controller of Possessive marking must immediately precede the NP bearing the marker, i.e., the Possessor and
the Possessed cannot be separated from each other by any other
elements of the clause. 44 This observation apparently undermines
the clause-external analysis of the Possessor.
And last, but not the least, the syntactic notion of topic, if
identified on the basis of sentences like in (570), would be limited
to this particular construction type, i.e., there is no evidence for
prominence of syntactic topics other than Possessors in Yukaghir
syntax.","[307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319]"
"In contradiction to the general scheme in (547), contrastive attributes may precede determiners and possessive pronouns. Such
cases are attested with attributes which single out one of several
people who have the same kinship relationship to somebody:
(555) a. 0rd'5-l

[middle-ANR] her daughter
'her middle daughter'
b. comö-l
tar) päbä-gi
[big-ANR] that elder.sister-POSS
'the oldest of those elder sisters of hers.'
Since the NP may contain more than one noun, its internal structure may turn out ambiguous, as shown in (556) : 3 9
(556) MODIFIER <MODIFIER HEAD> hea
<MODIFIER H E A D > M O D I P I E R HEADNoun phrases as noun modifiers289These options are illustrated in (557). Note that the NP-initial
demonstrative modifier is related to the NP as a whole in (557a),
but to the nominal modifier in (557b).
(557) a. tir) cu0l'e-d+omm
n'ied'i-l

'that story of the ancient people'
b. tintaij tetn'e-j
pulut
num0
cthat <be.rich-ATTR old.man>> house
'the house of that rich old man'
This structural ambiguity can be resolved by means of Possessive
marking (2.2.4) or Attributive marking (2.3.1).
2. Noun phrases as noun modifiers
There are three major ways to express the modifier-head relationship between two NPs:
1. Juxtaposition, or zero marking (see 2.1)
2. Possessive cross-reference marking on the head (see 5.2, 2.2)
3. Attributive marking on the modifier (see 5.5.1, 2.3).
Attributive and Possessive marking are incompatible, that is, the
Attributive modifier cannot serve as the controller of the Possessive marking on the head. 40
The functional distinction between these structural options can
be described in terms of referential autonomy of the modifier: the
Possessive marking can be applied only if the modifier has a referent of its own, most often, specific and definite (see 2.2.1). In
contrast to this, the Attributive marking signifies that the modifier is non-referential (2.3). Finally, the zero marking option is
unmarked with respect to the referential autonomy of the modifier (2.1), i.e., it can be employed independently of whether the
NP invokes a single referential entity or two separate entities.","[306, 307]"
"302Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositionalphraseThese considerations suggest that topicality should be viewed
as a pragmatic factor which ensures a sufficient degree of prominence of the Possessor to trigger the morphological marking of its
referential autonomy (see 2.2.1), but does not change its syntactic
status, i.e., the Possessor retains the syntactic properties of noun
modifiers.
2.2.3. Involvement
Another factor which can trigger internal Possessive marking is
the involvement of the Possessor in the situation being described.
For instance, in (572a) the Possessor ('his wife') participates in
the situation of arrival (which is shown by the Plural agreement
on the verb). In sentences like in (572b), the Possessor is obviously
affected by the situation:
(572) a. tat tudeterikeCA <his wife>soromo-p-te-ge
person-PL-POSS-LOCjaqa-iji
arrive-3PL:lNTR'Then they came to his wife's people.'
b. met tudel
Ihen'as'e-gicumuface-POSS allsasaha-t-u-t
tear-CAUS-0-FUT(TR:lSG)
Ί will tear his whole face.' [F54]However, this factor plays a role only in a relatively small class of
instances, presumably because there is a more direct way to signify that a Possessor is involved in the situation: it can just receive
the same case marking as the Possessed (cf. 5.4.1.4, <5.4.2.1). Such
constructions can be described as instances of ""External Possession"", as attested in many other languages. The contrast between
internal Possessive marking and the External Possession construction is illustrated by the following examples: in (573a) the Possessor takes the Accusative form, in (573b), it retains the unmarked
(Nominative) form:Noun phrases as noun modifiers(573) a. tatnum0-i)inqon-delletude[CA house-DAT go-SS:PFv] hisarjd'e-de-jle303terike-gele
wife-ACCulte-meye-POSS-ACC tie-TR:3SG'Then he went home and tied his wife's eyes. [F28]
b. tudeterike-mozünugen-de-jle[hiswife-PRSP]hand-POSS-ACCel+ju0,el+mojNEG+see(NEG:3SG)NEG+hold(NEG:3SG)'He has not seen or held his bride's hand. [F3]
(see 5.4.1.4 and 5.4.2.1 for more examples of Accusative and Dative
""doubling"" under the condition of the Possessive relationship between two instances of the same case). Note that if the head noun
itself is in the Nominative case (as in (572a)-(572b)), Yukaghir
has no morphological means to distinguish between the ""External
Possessor"" which is assigned to the same case role as the Possessed
(as in (573a)) and the Possessive modifier (as in (573b)).
Thus, Possessive marking on the head can serve a function similar to ""External Possessor"" constructions in other languages: once
it is applied, the Possessor can be conceived of as a participant
in the situation. This may but need not be reflected in the case
marking.
2.2.4. Structural implications of internal Possessive marking
Possessive marking entails some structural implications which can
be viewed as a sort of formal counterpart of the referential autonomy of the modifier. The structural autonomy of such modifiers
appears to be somewhat higher than in the zero-marked construction. More specifically, the controller of Possessive marking is
always an immediate constituent of the NP, or, the other way
round, an NP made up by means of this encoding strategy cannot
form a constituent of a ""larger"" NP (see 2.3.2 on the Attributive
Possessive marking).
This property manifests itself in the interpretation of NP-initial
demonstratives and quantifiers. As shown in 1.2, the zero mark-304Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositionalphraseing is ambiguous as to whether such an item is an immediate
constituent of the NP or of its nominal modifier; see (557). In contrast to this, internal Possessive marking licenses only the latter
interpretation, that is, the NP-initial demonstrative or quantifier
modifies the Possessor, but not the Possessed.
For instance, in (574a) the only possible reading is the one
suggested by the gloss ('a half of your hare'), while in the absence
of the Possessive marking the NP could have meant ""your half of
the hare""). A similar contrast applies to (574a) ('the wife of one
of his brothers', not 'one of his brother's wives').45)

2.3. Attributive marking: N P M - A T T R + N P H - C A S E
2.3.1. Simple Attributive marking
Attributive marking is described and exemplified in 5.5.1. Its semantic impact is opposite to that of Possessive marking: it signifies
that the modifier is non-referential. In this sense, Attributive encoding also constitutes the marked option to zero marking, but for
another class of situations.
More specifically, both options are available if the modifier doesNoun phrases as noun modifiers305not have a referent of its own, but can be thought of as an alternative conceptualization of the single referent invoked by the NP
(see 2.1.2), e.g., a girl can be conceptualized both as a woman and
as a child (575).

mit qorobo 0n'£e kudede-ge
child-PL-DiM our [cow
bull] kill-lMP:lPL
'Children, let us kill our bull!' [F29]
In contrast with zero-marked apposition (2.1.2), the Attributive
modifier need not serve as an appropriate conceptualization of the
relevant referent; it may just specify a property of the head referent. Thus, if the modifier does not meet this condition, only
Attributive marking is available (for clear examples of this kind,
see 5.5.1). This distinction gives a clue to understanding the factors that may trigger one or another option in less clear situations:
the Attributive form is employed to signal that the conceptualization provided by the modifier is not salient enough to constitute
an appropriate referential expression for the relevant entity in the
given situation. To put it the other way round, the head noun
provides a clearly more salient part of the description than the
modifier noun.
The relative salience of the alternative conceptualizations of an306Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositionalphraseentity is to a large extent determined by the situation involving
that entity. A clear example of this effect is given by a mythological story (see Text 1) with two major protagonists, one is the
king of a lake (or the lake king), the other, the king of a sea (or
the sea king). An essential property of these heroes is that they
are thought of simultaneously as natural objects (the lake and the
sea) and as personified entities ('kings'). Accordingly, the narrator employs alternatively Attributive marking and zero marking of
the modifiers ('lake' and 'sea'), but never resorts to a simple noun.
The Attributive form is used in all instances involving some sort
of personification, cf. (577b) and the second instance in (577c).
In contrast, when it is clearly the lake or the sea (as a natural
object) that is involved in the situation, zero marking is applied,
see (577a) and the first instance in (577c).
(577) a. jalhil pugedend'e ligu-mu-l'el <...>

seaöobu-n+pugedan'd'emol-l'elsea-ATTR+kingsay-lNFR(iNTR:3SG)'That was what the sea king said to him when he went
into the sea king.'
Thus, zero marking is employed if, in the given situation, the
property signified by the modifier is salient enough to constitute
an appropriate description of the referent. Attributive marking
presents the very same property as relatively ""marginal"".
This distinction can be employed to signal rather slight shifts
in conceptualization of an entity. For example, in a situation of aNoun phrases as noun modifiers307marriage being happily arranged, the fiancee's property of being a
""girl"" is conceived as significantly more salient than that of being
""a small goose"", hence the Attributive marking in (578a). Once the
agreement is broken (the reason being precisely that the fiancee
and the fiance belong to different species), the fact that she is
a ""small goose"" becomes more salient, hence the zero marking in
(578b).

owl-DAT

It is not the case that the semantic environment of the NP always
explains the choice of marking option. For instance, in (576) the
context appears not to provide any clues to the explanation of
the speaker's choice. However, the semantic impact of Attributive
vs. zero marking may be assumed to be the same, independently
of whether or not it is predictable from the context: Attributive
marking presents the modifying property as relatively marginal,
zero marking signifies that this property is ""central"" enough to
provide an appropriate conceptualization of the entity. 47 This assumption seems to be justified by the general semantic properties
of these encoding options, as described in 5.5.1 and 2.1.2.
Thus, Attributive marking in (579a) accords the primary
prominence to the conceptualization provided by the head noun
(what is most salient is that some bone has been broken), while
zero marking applied to a lexically identical NP in (579b) presents
the body part where the bone is located as a central property of
the referent (what is important is that 'it' has been attached to308Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositionalphrasethe wings). Similarly, the construction in (580a) is intended to
stress that there are no bad things (= drawbacks), not that there
is nothing at all. In contrast to this, the zero marking in (580b)
presents 'nothing' as an appropriate description of what has been
left.

On the other hand, Attributive marking appears to be preferred
in NPs containing more than two nouns, see (581a) and (581b).

This preference may be determined by the need to disambiguate
the internal structure of the NP (cf. (556)), since the NP created
by means of Attributive marking can function only as a single unit
within a ""larger"" NP.
2.3.2. Possessive Attributive marking
The Possessive Attributive suffix is described in 5.5.1.2. Its syntactic peculiarity is determined by the fact that it marks two relations
simultaneously: the Possessive relation (according to the Possessive marking scheme) and the modifier head relation between the
Possessed and the head noun. In other words, it is used to mark
the Possessive relationship between an NP and the modifier of
another NP.
(582)tar)marqiV arjd'e-deCthat girl>δζϊ<eye-POSS:ATTR water>'the tears of that girl (lit. the water of that girl's

With nominal heads, this marking is used almost exclusively
pronominally (583); the only instance of internal marking in my
corpus is given in (582).

Note that Possessive Attributive marking is not confined to nonreferential modifiers (as it is the case for the 'plain' Attributive
marking); in particular, it can serve as the controller of the Possessive marking on the head (583a).
This marking is rather infrequent with noun modifiers, but it
is used quite regularly in postpositional phrases (5.2, 11A.1) and
in Nominal relative clauses (U.S.2).
3. Quantifiers
Quantifiers comprise cardinal numerals (7.2.1), universal quantifiers (7.1.5), and scalar quantifiers (cä- 'be few', ninge- 'be many'),
see also 2.1.3 for quantification phrases. This section describes
only the scalar quantifiers. The scalar quantifiers belong to the
class of verbs.

The same lexical items are used for scalar
quantification of count nouns (585) and mass nouns (586). The
head noun takes the Singular form (see 5.3.1.4, 5.3.1.5).

If the quantified NP is the direct object, the scalar quantifier can
float to the preverbal position. In this construction, the quantifier
takes a special form in -ö, thus:

"4.1.6. The Instrumental case: patient-marking function
The Instrumental case can be used for the Ο participant if A
is third person (i.e., under the same condition as the Accusative
marking, see 4.1.4). This marking is incompatible with definite
pronouns, Possessive noun phrases and proper nouns (in these
cases, only the Accusative marking is available).

Focus marking (see 4.1.3), or implies definiteness and licenses the
Accusative marking thereby (see 4.1.4). This is rather a tendency
than a rule, since in a few examples the Instrumental marking is
applied to definite (175a) and/or modified noun phrases (175b).

The Dative expresses recipient, benefactive, purpose, direction,

(178) for verbs of transfer of things (177) and information (178)
(see also 9.2.4).

Possessive Dative (Supine).
The Dative marking can be doubled,whereby the second Dative (normally, the Possessive Dative form) is used to specify the
direction more precisely. The following examples illustrate this
phenomenon for a body part (184a) and for the Possessive form
of the AD-postposition al' (see 7.3.1.1.1):

with the Russian preposition do 'until':

wait-DETR-3PL:INTR'They waited until the morning.' [F36]
The Dative constitutes an element of some verb patterns (9.2.4,
9.2.6) and is used within the Body-Part form (see 4.2.2); see also
5.1.1 for its marginal use as a noun modifier.
4.2.2. The Dative marker within the Body-Part Form
There is a special Body-Part form built by means of the suffix
-me- followed by the Dative marker (cf. Krejnovich 1982:267-268).
It occurs with transitive verbs denoting direct physical violence,
whereby the person being acted upon is represented by the Accusative NP.

The Body-Part suffix can be preceded by the Possessive marker

a body-part slot.
4.2.3. The Comitative case
4.2.3.1. The Comitative in -n'e. The Comitative case either creates
a single noun phrase (whereby it can be glossed as 'and') (188),
or marks a secondary participant of a joint action or state (189a)
or a naturally reciprocal event (189b).

For further details on the semantics and syntax of the comitative,
see 5.4.1, 9.2.8, 5.3.2.1.
4.2.3.2. The Comitative in -n'it ~ -n'ut. The Comitative in -n'it ~
-n'ut is formally identical to the Imperfective same-subject converb
(£.1.4.3) of the Proprietive form (see 5.5.1), as illustrated in (190).

b. 0nme-n,-u-tejre-k[mind-PRPR-0-SS:LPFV] walk-LMP:2SG'Be clever! (lit. Walk around having mind.)' [F22]
The Comitative form in -n'it ~ -n'ut can signify that the participant plays the same role as the Ο participant (191), which is
incompatible with the same-subject interpretation implied by the
Imperfective converb (£.1.4.3). These and similar examples appear
to demonstrate that the combination of the Proprietive and the
Imperfective Converb markers has been ""frozen"" as an alternative
Comitative marker.","[113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"
"Ν Ρ conjunction3134. N P conjunction
Following Stassen (forthcoming), the concept of N P conjunction
is taken to cover all cases where one type of participation in the
event is ascribed to two (or more) separate entities (represented
by different lexical items). Yukaghir has three different strategies
for N P conjunction, which make use of the Comitative case (4.1),
asyndeton (4.2) and the connective adverb tähile (4.3).
4-1• ComitativestrategyThe Comitative strategy represents a sort of intermediate case
between the coordination of NPs (and-like) and the comitative
adjunct (with-like), a situation which seems to be fairly typical for
languages without a separate morpheme for ""and"" (Mithun 1988;
Stassen forthcoming).
The Comitative marker -n'e (5.4.3.2.1) can be employed to conjoin two (and only two) NPs representing the subject (590) or the
object (591) participants (it is not applied to more marginal participants). This construction is also possible with the alternative
Comitative form in -n'it ~ -n'ut; see 5.4.2.3.2 for examples.

The Comitative marking licenses only the single-event ('together')
interpretation of clauses like in (590)-(591), i.e., such a construction cannot be employed to describe two separate events involving
the conjoined participants in the same role.
The Comitative either creates a single noun phrase or introduces a new (comitative) participant (see 5.4.2.3.1). Accordingly,
if the Comitative is associated with the subject participant, the
verb agreement can be either Plural (see (590)) or Singular (592)).

abudä-l'el
there bear-cOM lie-iNFR(lNTR:3SG)
'She did not know where to go and lay down there
together with the bear.' [F4]
Furthermore, even if the agreement is Plural, the NP created by
means of this strategy is not subject to the Coordinate Structure
Constraint, i.e., the non-Comitative subject participant can be
dropped:
(593) a. met emd'ie-n'e
pon'o-jön-pe

δ-d'e

u0-die-n'e
cu0te
that my woman girl-DIM-COM always
me+juod-ü'i
AFF+play-lNTR:lPL
Ί always played with that girl.'
Note that in the periphrastic verb form in (593a), the nominal form
of the lexical verb bears the Plural marker, while the copula shows
Singular agreement. These observations suggest that there is no
clear border between 'and' and 'with' functions of the Comitative.
The Comitative marker -n'it (see 5.1.2, 5.4.2.3.2) can be applied to create a list of two or more NPs, each of which takes the
Comitative marker:

See also 9.3.2.1 on the free comitative marker.
4-2. Asyndeton
Several NPs in the same role can just follow each other, each in
the same case form, without any overt marking of conjunction.

this strategy, the verb can have the Singular form:
(596) a. cäcä-pe-gi

b. esie-gi
emej-gi
l'e-l'el-u-1
father-POSS mother-POSS be-lNFR-O-SF
'She had a father and a mother.' [F3]
This agreement presumably suggests that the construction may
be analyzed as a clause-conjunction with dropped verb forms; alternatively, it can be assumed that agreement is controlled by the
closest NP. 48
If conjoined NPs constitute a ""typical group"", they can share a
single Possessive pronoun (preceding the whole group) or even a
single suffix (attached to the last noun):

4-3. Conjunction with tahile 'then'
NPs can be conjoined by means of the connective adverbial tähile
~ täcile 'then' (see i^.3 for examples of its use as an adverbial).
The following examples illustrate its use for conjunction of Nominative NPs (titles of stories) (598a)-(598b), subject participants
(598c), noun modifiers (598d), and secondary comitative participants of a reciprocal situation (598e).

Generally, arguments of postpositions are encoded in the same way
as modifiers of nouns:
• The third person pronouns take the possessive form.
• Nouns can have the Nominative or the Attributive form.
• The argument of a postposition can control the Possessive
marker on that postposition.
However, the distribution of these marking options differs from
that attested in noun phrases: the possessive forms of third person
pronouns are not reflexive (5.1), and the Possessive Attributive
form is much more common than in NPs (5.2).
5.1. Possessive pronouns vs. Possessive markers
Formally, the pronominal arguments of postpositions are encoded
in the same way as pronominal possessive modifiers of nouns, either by the possessive forms of personal pronouns (7.1.1.2) or by
the Possessive marking (5.2, 2.2) on the postposition itself. Yet, in
NPs, the possessive forms of third person pronouns are reflexive,
that is, they signify that the Possessor is coreferential with the
subject of the clause. In postpositional phrases, this is not the
case, i.e., the possessive forms may (599), but need not (600) be
coreferential with the subject:

To some extent, the non-reflexive use of these forms is determined
by the fact that not all postpositions have the Possessive morphology, i.e., the non-reflexive counterpart of possessive pronouns
is not always available (see 7.3 for the list of postpositions which
have Possessive forms). Quite predictably, since one member of
the opposition is not available, the opposition is neutralized.
It should be noted, however, that the possessive pronouns may
be used non-reflexively with those postpositions which do take thePostpositionalphrases321Possessive markers; see (600c) and (601):
(601)jouhodari-dieal'-de-geqodö-jbag-DiMnear-POSS-LOCIie-INTR:3SG'The bag lay near him.' [F49]
In other words, the functional opposition between reflexive (free)
and non-reflexive (bound) pronominal modifiers is neutralized for
arguments of all postpositions, independently of the morphological
availability of the latter option in each particular case. It may be
assumed, therefore, that the noun-to-postposition grammaticalization in Yukaghir involves two partially independent processes:
• Reinterpretation of the possessive modifier as the argument
of a postposition. The possessive form of pronominal modifiers is preserved, but it is reinterpreted as a non-Possessive
instance of the personal pronoun, hence the loss of the reflexive meaning (which is associated only with the possessive use
of personal pronouns, see 7.1.1).
• Loss of the nominal morphology, in particular, of the Possessive morphology.
As seems to be shown by the examples above, the functional reinterpretation is a prerequisite for the loss of the Possessive morphology, but not vice versa.
5.2. Attributive marking
The non-Possessive Attributive form is available for arguments of
postpositions, but occurs extremely rarely. In fact, there are but
few examples of this usage (602). This is quite predictable, since
the arguments of postpositions are normally referential, which precludes Attributive marking (see 2.3).

In contrast to this, the Possessive AttributivePossessive markinglin

"An overviewof KolymaYukaghirgrammar92.3. Syntax
Word order patterns in Kolyma Yukaghir are overwhelmingly
head-final. This order is obligatory in noun phrases (attribute
- noun, numeral - noun, possessor - possessee, etc.), postpositional phrases (noun - adposition) and non-finite clauses (SOV),
and it is preferred in main clauses. However, in the latter case,
other word orders are possible.
NPs are easily dropped whenever recoverable from the discourse
context and/or speech situation.
There is virtually no coordination, either between NPs or between clauses. The main strategy of NP conjunction is comitative
marking, and the main strategy of clause conjunction is clause
chaining.
2.3.1. Case marking and grammatical Focus
Case marking patterns in main clauses are dominated by the Focus
system. Grammatical Focus is marked by means of the Predicative
case and an appropriate verb form (see Table 3). This marking
works on an ergative basis, that is, it can be applied to intransitive
subjects and direct objects, as shown in (7):
(7) a. tat touke-lek
jedej-l
CA dog-PRED appear-SF
'Then a / t h e dog appeared.' [K3]
b. locil-ek
ti-tä
piecet-nu-l'el-mele
fire-PRED here-there kindle-iPFV-lNFR-OF:3SG
'(She) made campfires here and there.' [K3]
The major function of the grammatical Focus is to delimit the
scope of assertion from the preceding material (either within or
outside the given clause), whereby the NP marked for Focus is
conceived as the left-most (i.e., the first in the linear order) constituent within the scope of assertion.
If a clause is marked for grammatical Focus, no other case marking of core participants is needed. Similarly, if the subject is first
or second person, and the direct object is third person, both occur10Chapter1.","[26, 27, 28]"
"From the syntactic point of view, such examples do not contra-Semanticsof grammaticalFocus457diet the clause-internal analysis of Focus, since both post-position
of non-finite clauses and nesting are available independently of
whether or not the chain contains a shared Focus. In particular, non-Focus constituents of the finite clause may precede the
non-finite clause(s) as well, see iO.1.3.1.1, 10.1.3.2.
Note, however, that apart from the chains with shared Focus,
the nesting structure is associated with a relatively high degree
of semantic cohesion between clauses and/or backgrounding of
the non-finite clauses (see 10.2.3-10.2Λ). In contrast to this, the
shared Focus triggers this structure independently of the semantic
relations between clauses. For instance, (794c) and (795) instantiate the case of temporal chaining which is not likely to involve
the nesting structure outside the context of shared Focus.
Thus, for sentences like (794) and (795) to conform with the
general properties of clause chains, the shared Focus must be assumed to impose a sufficient degree of semantic cohesion and/or
backgrounding to license the nesting structure. In other words,
from the semantic point of view, the shared Focus is a chain-level,
rather than a clause-level phenomenon.
This semantic feature appears to be better accounted for under
the clause-external analysis of Focus. The preposed Focus would
then be taken to dominate the whole clause chain, which in turn
can be analyzed as a complex free relative clause with relativized
subject. This analysis is warranted by the possibility of relativization of the shared subject from clause chains (see ii.3.1.1). Thus,
the availability of the nesting structure as in (794) and (795) may
indicate that the grammatical Focus retains some properties of a
cleft-like structure.
3. Semantics of grammatical Focus
Focus marking in Yukaghir is strongly constrained in terms of the
participant roles it is compatible with: it can be applied only to
one participant per clause type, the S participant of an intransitive
clause and the Ο participant of a transitive clause (see 2.2). In
other words, the widely known ""focus prominence"" of Yukaghir
has to be understood, in the case of Kolyma Yukaghir, in a rather458Chapter12. Nominalpredicatesand grammaticalFocusspecific fashion: it is not a language which marks which element
of a (finite) clause represents the Focus of this clause. Rather, it
is a language which marks each finite clause for whether or not its
S / 0 participant is the Focus.
If the S/O constituent represents the only element within the
scope of assertion (narrow focus) or its contrastive part, Focus
marking is compulsory (3.1). Conversely, if this constituent is
excluded from the scope of assertion, only the neutral packaging
option is available. Between these poles, the Focus marking is
applied to delimit the assertion rendered by the given clause from
the preceding material. More specifically, it identifies the S/O
constituent as the first constituent within the scope of assertion
(3.2). Thus, generally, the grammatical opposition between the
neutral and Focus packaging options is used not to mark the status
of a single constituent, but rather serves a more global informationstructuring function.
It should be stressed that this marking operates independently
of the discourse-determined statuses of the NPs involved, like newness, accessibility, etc. The most compelling evidence of this independence is given by the Focus marking of pronominal (i.e., highly
accessible) NPs (3.2.4), on the one hand, and the regular absence
of this marking in text-initial existential clauses, where the S participant obviously represents a new entity (3.2.5).
3.1. Compulsory Focus marking
There are a few easily identifiable environments which always trigger Focus marking, that is, discourse or clause-internal contexts
in which Focus marking is compulsory. This class comprises environments where the situation being described is taken to constitute the presupposed or implied information (i.e., the finite verb
belongs to the pragmatic presupposition of the clause; see 3.1.13.1.2) and the contexts of explicit contrast associated with the
S/O constituent (3.1.3).
Note that these environments are defined for both S/O constituents as a whole and for modifiers within such NPs, i.e., the
Focus-marking system generally does not distinguish between theSemanticsof grammaticalFocus459Focus on the whole constituent and on one of its subconstituents
(see, however, 5.4.1.3, for the effect of this distinction on the choice
of the Predicative marker on NP).
3.1.1. Question words
If the S/O constituent is represented by an interrogative pronoun
or contains a question word, it has to be marked as the Focus
(796).

This case is fully grammaticalized: the Focus marking is mandatory whenever a question word occurs in the S/O position, i.e.,
not only in question-word questions, but also in dependent clauses
made up as questions (where the interrogative pronoun functions
as a sort of relative pronoun, see 13.5.3), and in exclamatory sentences with question words (see 13.3.1.1).","[474, 475, 476, 477]"
"Valence-changingmorphology2274-5. Reciprocal and Reflexive
4.5.1. Formation
The reciprocal marker is n'e-, the reflexive marker, met-. These
morphemes cannot be combined within one verb form, i.e., the reciprocal and reflexive meanings are treated by Yukaghir grammar
as opposed members of one category.
(429) a. met tudel ju0
Ihe

Ί saw him' [I]b. mit

RECP-see-lPL:lNTR'We saw each other' [I]
c. tudel
hemet-ju0-j
REFL-see-3SG:iNTR'He is looking at himself' [I]
Both the reciprocal and the reflexive decrease verb valence, which
in the vast majority of cases results in formal shift from the Transitive agreement pattern to the Intransitive one.
Phonologically, these morphemes are characterized by a looser
connection with the stem than the suffixes, so that the boundary
between a prefix and its stem may be described as internal open
juncture. For example, clustering of vowels on morpheme boundaries is prohibited within the postfixal part of a word, but possible
on a""preverbal"" boundary, e.g., n'e+aji- 'to shoot each other' (see
also 5.2.3.1).
4.5.2. Functions of the Reciprocal
4.5.2.1. Reciprocal constructions. The Reciprocal marks a reciprocal situation in which the reciprocal participants correspond to
the subject argument and some other argument of the verb. The
Reciprocal marker is productive and semantically very regular; it
can be attached to a verb whenever a reciprocal situation involving the relation expressed by that verb can be imagined. There
seem to be no purely grammatical restrictions on this operation,228Chapter6. Verbmorphologye.g., in terms of transitivity, syntactic function assigned to the
secondary argument, etc. However, if the secondary participant
is represented by an NP other than direct or indirect object, an
additional free reciprocal marker is required (see 9.3.2.2).
Although most instances of reciprocal marking involve the subject and the direct object arguments of a transitive verb, this seems
to be just a consequence of the fact that most two-argument verbs
are transitive (cf. 9.2.1). The examples in (430) illustrate this
most frequent case:

'The two of them brought each other (if, for example,
one of them was blind and the other lame).'
The examples in (431) illustrate the reciprocal marking involving the recipient (indirect object) participant (431a), and the addressee (431b); in the latter case, the additional free reciprocal
marking is needed (see 9.3.2.2 for further examples of this type).

See also 9.2.8 for another, marginal, option for encoding of the
reciprocal participants.
4.5.2.2. Natural reciprocals. The morphological reciprocal marker
can be attached to verbs signifying so called ""naturally reciprocal"" situations, without any significant change in the meaning, cf.
(430c) and (434a):

See also 3.3.2.3 for a natural reciprocal derived by means of an
Iterative suffix.
4.5.2.3. Incorporation. There are two attested cases of incorporation of a nominal stem between the reciprocal marker and verb
stem; the incorporated stem fills the patient/theme slot of the
verb.

Generally, incorporation-like phenomena are not characteristic of
Yukaghir, and the status of these cases within its grammar remains
unclear. It should be noted that neither a verb like *p0me-har)s'i'lice-search' nor one like *azu+medi- 'language-understand' exists
in Yukaghir independently; these combinations are possible only
in the context of the reciprocal. The form n'e-p0me-aijs'i-jejl'i 'we
are looking for each other's lice' is found in the texts collected byValence-changingmorphology231Jochelson (1900:47), but this is the only example of this type in
his data. The grammaticality of this form was confirmed by my
consultants in 1987 (see (435)). The second example is taken from
a text written down by myself in 1992, but I have not managed to
elicit any other instances of this phenomenon during my field work.
It thus remains unclear whether there are strong lexical restrictions
on this phenomenon, or if it is a rare (perhaps marginal), but
free (with respect to the lexical items involved) type of reciprocal
construction.
4.5.2.4. Lexicalization. Some combinations of the reciprocal
marker and verb stem are apparently lexicalized, e.g., n'e-mejnu'to get married, to join' (from mejnu- 'to take something'),
n'e-lej-nu-l-ben 'predator' (RECP-eat-iPFV-ATTR-RELNR), lit. 'one
who eats each other'.
4.5.3. Functions of the Reflexive
The Reflexive marker met- (Jochelson 1905) ascribes the patient/theme role (implied by the meaning of the verb stem) to
the agent/experiencer participant of the same situation.
(436) a. met joul'e-t

oneself, hold oneself' (moj- 'hold'). See also 6.4.4.2 for nonproductive middle-like derivatives.","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249]"
"585final voiceless obstruent of a stem, as described in 5.3.2.1.
In this sentence, the Plural marking on the verb is controlled by the
Locative NP; for a description of such constructions, see 12.1.2.3.
Krejnovich (1982:249) suggests that the A participant in Kolyma Yukaghir may get the Predicative marking as well; however, his examples
of this phenomenon contain detransitivized verbs (with the suffix -ze-,
see 6.4.4.2), so that the Predicative marker is in fact attached to the S
participant.
For Ο marking in non-finite clauses, see 9.1.2.2.
Krejnovich (1982:253; 256) observes a correlation between the choice
of -(e)k on the head and the presence of an attributive modifier; this
correlation is in accordance with the functional account suggested here.
Krejnovich (1982:250-251; 256-257) considers presence vs. absence of a
(lexical) noun modifier as the major factor which determines the choice
of the Accusative vs. Instrumental marking.
The combination u0+i70- 'child+be-' is apparently lexicalized with the
meaning 'be young'
The verb inflection has been described by Jochelson (1905) and discussed
by Krejnovich (1982:184-216). Krejnovich (1982:201-208), in contrast to
(Jochelson 1905), claims that the transitive verb in Kolyma Yukaghir
has the SF form in -I. This claim strongly contradicts my data, see
(Maslova 1997) for details and discussion. The absence of the transitive
SF paradigm in Kolyma Yukaghir represents one of the major divergent
features between the Yukaghir languages, as Tundra Yukaghir has a
specialized transitive SF form with zero inflection (Krejnovich 1955;
1982:209-210).
Krejnovich (1982:149-151) includes the form in -τη both in the Interrogative and in the Imperative paradigm; see 13.3.1.1 and 13.3.2 for
Interrogative applications of this form.
See 5.4.1.3, 12.2 for further examples and discussion.
This is a clear point of divergence between Kolyma and Tundra Yukaghir. In the latter, the affirmative pre-verb is employed much more
frequently and can be analyzed as Predicate Focus marker (Maslova
1989; Comrie 1992; Fortescue 1996).
The -ge- ~ -h- ~ -j- alternation in the third person Conditional DS converbs instantiates the same morphophonemic rule as the alternation of
the Accusative marker after the Possessive marker (see 5.1.3); in fact,
the Accusative marker may be assumed to have developed from the
generic locative marker.
According to Krejnovich (1982:167), the forms in -l-ge(ne) are used with
the singular subject and the forms in -l-u-ke(ne) express the plurality
of subject. This correlation is not confirmed by my data. The form in586Notes-l-u-ge(ne) is absent from the paradigm presented by Krejnovich.
29. Normally, the controlling clause is the next clause of a chain. See 10.1.1
for further details.
30. In fact, these suffixes might have been described as expressing Aktionsarten. Krejnovich (1982:121ff) describes all the suffixes under discussion in this chapter as sposby protekaniya dejstviya (i.e., Aktionsarten).
31. It should be noted that the Result Nominal cannot be analyzed as the
Action Nominal form of the Resultative (although formally it might be
possible), just because the Resultative formation can be applied to a semantically restricted class of verbs (see 3.6.2), while the Result Nominal
form is available for any verb.
32. In Tundra Yukaghir two variants of the regular causative suffix, -s- and
-se-, are distributed according to the general morphophonemic rule described in 5.3.4.1 (see Krejnovich 1982:68; Maslova 1993:273).
33. See 5.3.1.2.3 on the /d'/ ~ /n/ alternation.
34. My informants seemed to be able to construct the form by attaching
the nominal Instrumental marker to a pronominal stem, but not to use
it, and it does not occur in texts.
35. Here the Free Possessive form functions as a nominal modifier (see <9.2.1
on this construction).
36. Notably, this nominalizer was rendered as -bon by W.Jochelson (1900),
which makes it possible to posit the original form *b0n.
37. This meaning is rendered by the noun k0nme 'mate; the other'.
38. In one example in [F9], the temporal demonstrative form tudä appears
to be used as a noun modifier ('former""), see (571b). Since there are
no other examples of this sort, this phenomenon is not discussed in the
grammar.
39. In this chapter, the internal structure of complex NPs is indicated by
angle brackets in the interlinear gloss.
40. The Possessive Attributive marking (2.3.2) constitutes an exception to
this rule.
41. In this chapter, two separate referential entities invoked by an NP with
nominal modifier are called 'Possessor"" and ""Possessed"", independently
of the exact semantics of the relation between them.
42. This is about the hero of a fairy-tale who has a bubble for a head, and
that is why his name is Bubblehead.
43. The thing is a straw and a worm at the same time.
44. This rule does not cover the cases of pronominal Possessive marking, as
described in 2.2.1.1.
45. This meaning is not ruled out by cultural knowledge, since polygamy
used to be allowed in the Yukaghir tribes.

Morphology (Chapters 4-7), Syntax (Chapters 8-14), and Texts
(Appendix 3). The lexicon is represented by two Appendices: a
Yukaghir-English vocabulary (Appendix 1) and an exemplified list
of nonproductive verbal derivational suffixes (Appendix 2). The
Morphology is divided into chapters according to the classification
into parts of speech, which is introduced in Chapter 4. The further
structuring of each chapter is essentially determined by two kinds
of considerations, which can be called paradigmatic and semantic:
Whenever some morphological items clearly constitute a paradigm, they are treated as such. Normally, I start a description of a
paradigm with a listing of opposed items and their form(s), which
is followed by a semantic (functional) description of each particular
item. If it appears that some morpheme can be more appropriately described separately, not as a member of any paradigmatic
opposition (this is the case for some derivational morphemes), its
form and meaning are treated together. In both cases, I take the
form-to-function approach, that is, I describe the meaning(s) (or
function(s)) of grammatical items singled out on formal grounds.
These considerations determine the ""micro-structure"" of the morphological description.
On the other hand, the ""macro-structure"" of each chapter follows the function-to-form approach, that is, it features such general semantic categories as, e.g., ""Aspect"" or ""Demonstrative pronoun"", under which various paradigms or separate morphological
items are subsumed on functional grounds. In practice, this means
that considerations of semantic affinity prevail over distinctions in
the grammatical status, in particular, over the opposition between
inflection and derivation. For instance, the section on Aspect deals
with all morphological means employed for expressing aspectual
meanings, regardless of their regularity, productivity, and the like.
This is not to say, of course, that such properties are not explicated for each item. Normally, each section starts with a general
overview of the morphological means it describes, their (formalAbout this grammar15and semantic) relations to each other, grammatical status, etc.
The Syntax is structured according to similar considerations.
It is divided into seven chapters associated with more or less traditional topics in syntax, as determined by general classification
of syntactic units and types of syntactic relations. The internal
structure of each chapter is determined by grammatical distinctions expressed in Yukaghir, that is, the constructions are classified according to functional considerations, which helps to highlight the contrasting features of functionally similar constructions.
On the micro-level, the description of each construction takes the
form-to-function approach: my aim is to describe and exemplify
various constructions and the meaning(s) associated with these
constructions.
I believe that this combination of the form-to-function approach
to the description proper and the function-to-form approach to
classification of items into chapters and sections of a grammar
appropriately suits the objectives of this endeavor: on the one
hand, it provides a reasonable degree of accessibility of information on the basis of rather general and semantically motivated
headings determined by the more or less widely assumed view
on what a descriptive grammar should cover; on the other hand,
on the micro-level it licenses a description of grammatical items
and associated semantic configurations, as they are attested in the
specific language, rather than mapping of linguistic constructs and
concepts onto that language.
To be sure, at a number of points these approaches turn out to
be in contradiction, i.e., the range of functions associated with a
morphological item or syntactic construction crosses the ""boundaries"" set by the general semantic considerations. There is no one
way to solve the descriptive problems produced by such contradictions that can be applied throughout the grammar. However,
there are two technical devices which are intended to override
these contradictions: cross-references between the relevant fragments of the grammar and special sections providing summaries
of interrelated phenomena treated in different parts of the grammar (e.g., there is a summary of properties which identify the16Chapter 1.","[32, 33, 34]"

The formal variation described in 1.4.2 applies to the Action Nominal and the Result Nominal verb forms (the markers -I and -öl respectively, see £.1.3.1). In this case, the variation appears to have
a functional burden, namely, it distinguishes verb forms (where /1/
is dropped obligatorily) and nouns resulting from lexicalization of
those forms (where / I / is not dropped), cf.:

The grammatical Possessive relation covers a wide range of relationships between entities. As in many languages, it clusters
around three meanings, the part-whole relationship (136a), kinship (136b), and belonging (136c). For further details on the semantics of grammatical Possession, see 8.2.
The bound Possessive suffixes -gi, -de- mark the Possessive relation between the referent of the noun phrase and some third
person/entity which is not the subject of the clause within which
the noun phrase occurs (136a). In particular, the controller of the
Possessive marking can serve as a modifier within the same NP
(136b)-(136c). If the same relation holds between the referent and
the first or the second person, or between the referent and the
subject participant of the clause, the Possessive forms of personal
pronouns must be used (see 7.1.1.2).

Nominal morphology1. Formation of major categories
Major nominal inflectional categories are Number, Case and Possessive. The markers are agglutinated to a stem or to each other
as represented by the following scheme (""X"" stands for stem; see
also Tables 10, 11):
(124)X-NUMBER-POSSESSIVE-CASEThe whole paradigm is compatible with nouns and all Nominal
verb forms; the non-Possessive sub-paradigm, with interrogative,
demonstrative and indefinite pronouns (see 7.1.2, 7.1.3, 7.1.4), the
Case sub-paradigm, with personal pronouns (7.1.1).

The Plural marker -p(ul)- is chosen after stems in {E}, -pe- otherwise (as described in 5.3.4.1.4). The allomorphic variation -ρ- ~
-pul- is determined by the next morph, as shown in Table 10. The
final /// of a stem is normally dropped before the Plural marker
(see 1.2.)
1.1.1. Irregular Plural
There is one instance of irregular plural formation: u0 'child' >
u0-r-pe 'children' (see also 1.1.2 on this stem). However, if the
Plural marker is followed by the Possessive marker and signifies
the plurality of the Possessor (see 3.2.3), it is attached to the stem
in a regular way, cf. u0-pe-gi 'their child' and u0-r-pe-gi 'his/their
children'.
1.1.2. ""Frozen"" Plural marker
In combination with three nominal stems, the Plural marker can
lose its meaning, so that a second Plural marker can be attached
in order to express the plurality of entities:
(125)k0j ~ k0jl k0j-pe
paj ~ pajl paj-pe
u0
u0r-pek0j-pe-pul
paj-pe-pul

"362Chapter9. Syntaxb. titof thenor/δηclausekimd'i-met?you whyfight-lTR:2PL'Why have you been fighting?' [F31]
The Comitative valence option exists for some morphological Reciprocals as well (661), although the one-slot variant is far more
frequent (see 6.4.5.2 for examples):
(661)irkid'et%modo-jeone-iTER [there live-ATTRlige-je
be:old-ATTR]pulut-n'en'e-nü-1'elold:man-COMRECP-find-INFR(lNTR: 3SG)Once he met with a very old man living there.' [F31]
Given the general properties of the Comitative strategy of NP
conjunction (8.4.1), there can be no sharp border between the
one-slot and the Comitative valence options. For instance, the
example in (662) apparently represents the Comitative option, yet
the verb agreement is Plural:
(662)qahiel-n'e il'ede-rji
loon-COMquarrel-3PL:INTR'He quarreled with the loon.' [F5]
3. Clausal adjuncts
3.1. Overview of clausal adjuncts
3.1.1. Spatial and temporal adjuncts
Spatial adjuncts are expressed by means of the local case forms
of NPs (5.4.2.5), by postpositions (7.3.1-7.3.2), by local forms of
demonstratives (7.1.2.1) and by locative adverbs (^.2.2). Temporal adjuncts can be expressed by the Dative case (5.4.2.1), the
Locative case (5.4.2.5.1), the Ablative case (5.4.2.5.2) and by some
postpositions (7.3.2). Nouns denoting periods of time have a special Temporal form (5.5.3).
These adjuncts tend to be clause-initial (663) or, less frequently,
clause-final (663a), (664):Clausal adjuncts363cu0l'e-d+omm

See 11Λ.1-11Λ.2, 13.5.3.1 for a description of spatial and temporal
adverbial clauses.
3.1.2. Cause, Purpose and Manner
Causal adjuncts are expressed by the Ablative NP (5.4.2.5.2) or
the Prolative NP (5.4.2.5.3). Purpose adjuncts are expressed by
the Dative NP (5.4.2.1) or by the Transformative (5.5.5.2). Manner adjuncts are expressed either by the Instrumental (5.4.2.4) or
by adverbs (^.2.1), including adverbially used qualitative stems
(^.3.3). Such adjuncts normally take the preverbal position:

Comparative constructions are built by means of an adjunct representing the standard of comparison; no other marking is needed.
For comparison of equality, the standard of comparison is marked
by the postposition tite 'as, like' (see 7.3.3); for comparison of
inequality, it is marked by the Ablative case, e.g.:
(666) a. U0+7]5-1

g e t . c a u g h t - C AUS-INFR-INTR: 1 PL'We have caught more than twenty.'
The idea of inequality can be stressed by means of the connective
particle äj ~ ajt (667a), see 14-2.2.1. This particle is also used if
the standard of comparison is implicit (667b).
(667) a. mit-ketäjpudö-l'elwe-ABL CP high-iNFR(3SG)tudel

The superlative degree is expressed by using the quantifier cumu

Sociative markers comprise the free comitative marker (3.2.1), free
reciprocal markers (3.2.2) and collective adverbials (3.2.3).
3.2.1. The free comitative marker
The Comitative adjunct can be represented by a noun phrase in
the Comitative case (cf. 5.4.1). There is also a free comitative
marker n'ahä 'together (with)'. Most often, this marker follows a
Comitative NP:
(669) a. mit-n'en'ahämit touke-pul kel-ηί-Ιwe-cOM together our dog-PLcome-3PL-SF'Our dogs came along with us.'

"Introductionsyntactic function of subject in Yukaghir; since these properties
manifest themselves in various types of syntactic constructions,
they are described in detail in different sections of the grammar).
To sum up, the macro-structure of the description offered here
is determined by how I understand what descriptive linguistics
is about; in many respects, it follows such general guidelines for
descriptive linguists as Lingua Descriptive Questionnaire (Comrie
and Smith 1977) and Language Typology and Syntactic Description (Shopen 1985). The micro-structure is determined by what I
know of Kolyma Yukaghir and represents an attempt to describe
the language ""in its own terms"".
3.3. Data for this study and exemplification
This grammar is based on two types of data: authentic texts in
contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir and linguistic interviews with its
native speakers (see Acknowledgments). My text database comprises texts published by Irina Nikolaeva in 1989 and texts written
down by Nikolay Vakhtin (1987) and myself (1987, 1992);3 some
of the latter are published in (Maslova 2001), and some are included in this grammar (see Appendix 5); in order to increase the
reliability of data, all controversial and/or questionable sentences
of these texts have been double-checked with native speakers. 4
As discussed in Chapter 2, Kolyma Yukaghir has been under
strong pressure from Russian for at least several decades. This,
in combination with the well-known methodological drawbacks of
interviews, makes this sort of data far less reliable than those
elicited from authentic texts. That is why I tried to use only
text examples for illustrative purposes. As a result, some of these
examples might seem too long and complex for the point they are
intended to illustrate. Unfortunately, it is too often the case that
an authentic sentence ""simplified"" by a linguist for some didactic
purposes is not a reliable example anymore. In the case of such
languages as Yukaghir, the ""unnecessary"" complexity of examples
is the price to be paid for reliability of data. Even if I had a
simpler and, in some sense, ""clearer"" example in my field notes,
I always chose in favor of a text example. 5 In some cases, whereAbout this grammar17this seemed to be inevitable, I did ""shorten"" illustrative sentences;
note that all such omissions are shown by <...>; such examples
should not be taken as ""complete sentences"".
There is, of course, a range of phenomena which cannot be
appropriately described in this fashion because they are absent or
rare in the texts, but are readily produced by my informants in an
interview. These phenomena are described in the grammar on the
basis of my field notes, but with explicit reservations concerning
the source of the data. If an example elicited in an interview
is included in the grammar (in order to avoid loss of significant
information), the source is indicated by the letter ""I"" after the
idiomatic translation.
3.4· Terminologyand glossingconventionsIn choosing grammatical terms for Yukaghir phenomena, as well
as in interlinear morphemic translations of the examples, I followed the EUROTYP guidelines (Bakker et al. 1992). All phrasal
examples are provided with morpheme-to-morpheme interlinear
translations; the syntactic structure is indicated by brackets. The
boundaries between independent finite clauses are indicated by the
symbol
In some sections, angled or curly brackets are used for
some additional information (e.g., to indicate the scope of assertion in the section on the semantics of Focus).","[34, 35]"
"Core participantsand grammaticalrelations3411.4.3. Indirect object properties (Dative participant)
The following properties are shared by the Ο participant and the
Dative participant of a ditransitive clause (see 2.4.2), in contrast
to more marginal constituents:
• The Ο participant and the Dative participant of a ditransitive
clause can take the Accusative case form (both the regular
Accusative and the pronominal Accusative, see 2.4).
• The reciprocal relation between the primary participant, on
the one hand, and the Ο participant or the Dative participant, on the other, can be marked by means of the Reciprocal
marking on the verb alone (6.4.5.2), while for more marginal
participants a free postposition-based reciprocal marker (see
3.2.2) is needed.
• The Ο participant and the Dative participant can control the
omitted primary participant in the Supine Purpose clause
(11.4.4).611.5. Constituent order
1.5.1. Basic word order
The most frequent word order in terms of the core constituents is
subject-object-verb, which is illustrated by most of the examples
in this grammar. However, the word order, in particular in finite
clauses, is rather flexible and is more appropriately described by
the following ""discourse-oriented"" scheme:
(619) Topic-Focus-verb-(After-Topic)
Since the Focus is grammaticalized, this scheme imposes two strict
constraints on the word order variation: the Focus cannot follow
the verb (see 14-2.2.3), and the A constituent cannot intervene
between the Ο Focus and the finite verb. As shown in 1.1.1, the
latter rule can play a major role in distinguishing the participants
of a clause.","[358, 359]"
"Overviewof verb patterns347This ensures a very wide domain of application of the transitive
pattern, i.e., this pattern covers situation types which are very far
from the semantic prototype of transitivity (including such meanings as 'be afraid of', 'speak about', 'stand on', 'laugh at', etc.,
see 2.3). In fact, the vast majority of two-slot patterns and all the
patterns with more than two slots are transitive.
Apart from the core participants, Yukaghir shows a rather close
correspondence between the case marking and the role interpretation of a slot. Instances of conventionalized deviations from the
case semantics (as described in 5.4.2) are very rare. They can be
summarized as follows:
1. Some transitive verbs have Body Part slots for the Ablative
or the Prolative NP (2.3.2).
2. Both intransitive (2.5.1) and transitive (2.5.2) verbs can have
the Ablative slot with partially unpredictable role semantics.
Although in most cases the Ablative slot in such patterns
can be described (more or less appropriately) in terms of a
metaphorical ""source"" or ""starting point"", its specific instances
appear to be conventional. Note, however, that the Ablative
lends itself most easily (of all peripheral cases) to various
metaphorical extensions, independently of its usage within
verb patterns; see 5.4.2.5.2).
3. There are marginal intransitive patterns with the Locative
Experiencer (2.7.2.1) and the Dative Experiencer (2.7.1). The
latter seems to be closely associated with the Benefactive
(Malefactive) function of the Dative (see 5.4.2.1).
4. Some verbs have a slot which can be filled either by the Locative NP or by the Dative NP. For the verbs of movement (""Directional"" slot, see 2.6), this variability could be accounted for
in terms of the ""adverbial"" nature of the slot. It should be
noted, however, that the directional reading of the Locative
is possible only within this pattern. Furthermore, the same
variability is preserved in the metaphorical applications of
the Directional pattern (ii.1.6), as well as in the peripheral
Experiencer slot (at least for some verbs; see 2.7.2).","[364, 365]"

NP itself.
2.3.2. Clause chaining
Kolyma Yukaghir makes extensive use of clause chaining, where
non-finite verb forms marked for switch reference (converbs) are
used for all clauses except the final one:

The range of functions covered by the converbs in Kolyma Yukaghir is extremely broad. Clause chaining is the main strategy
for describing a sequence of temporally adjacent or related events,
as well as for conditional and concessive constructions. This construction is also regularly used to describe the situation of perception, where the situation being perceived is expressed as the finite
clause (cf. (10a)). Another noteworthy application of converbs is
for aspect-like internal structuring of a single event, as in (9c) and
(lOd).
2.3.3. Relativization and complementation
Relative clauses are built by means of the Attributive verb forms,
the Action Nominal, and, far less frequently, by the Result Nominal. The syntactic roles accessible for relativization are the subject
(11a), the direct object ( l i b ) , the spatial or temporal adverbial
(11c), and the Possessor of the intransitive subject ( l i d ) .

Attributive form is used to mark the Possessive relation between
the referent of a nominal modifier and a Possessor outside the noun
phrase (according to the rules outlined in Section 2 for the regular
Possessive markers):

(see ii.3.1.4) and for arguments of postpositions (see 5.5.2).
5.2. The Privative form
The Privative form ('without X') is built by the combination of
the prepositional negative marker el+ and the postpositional morpheme +cu0n:

See 6.1.4.8 about a formally identical Negative non-finite form of
verbs.
5.3. The Temporal form
The nouns denoting seasons or other periods of time attach the
suffix -me to create the adverb-like Temporal form:
(236)cied'e-me
winter-TMP
joule-me
evening-TMP
emil-me
night-TMP'in winter'
'in the evening'
'at night'These forms have the generic meaning, i.e., they do not refer to
any specific period of time.

5-4· The Prospective form
The Prospective form ('what is going to be X') is derived by means
of the postpositional marker -mozü-, to which the inflectional122Chapter 5. Nominalmorphologymarkers are attached. Within the noun morphology proper, this
suffix is outmoded and is commonly used only to derive the words
terike+mozü 'bride' (wife+PRSP) and •pulut+mozü 'bridegroom'
(husband+PRSP), being available but very infrequently otherwise.
Yet it is widely used in combination with Nominal forms of the
verb to create the Prospective Nominal form; see 5.1.3.5.
5.5. Verbal forms
5.5.1. The Proprietive form
The Proprietive form is built by means of the suffix -n'e- ~ -n'(see 5.3.4.1.6). Note that its syllabic variant is identical to the
Comitative marker (see 5.1.2, 5.4.2.3), and the meaning is similar
('have, be with'). Yet, in contrast to the Comitative case form,
the Proprietive is completely verb-like with respect to its external
syntax. It has verbal inflection and can occur in all environments
where a verb can occur:

However, in its internal syntax, it behaves mostly like a noun, i.e.,
it can be modified by the Attributive form of a numeral (239a),
by a relative clause((239b)-(239c)), by the Attributive form of a
noun ((239a), (239d)) or pronoun ((239e)-(239f)) (see <9.1.1 for
the list of possible noun modifiers).

the parallel denominal derivatives meaning 'get X' and 'give X to
somebody', which behave just as verbs (see 6.4.2). Note, however,
that there is a set of verbs resulting from lexicalization of the
Proprietive forms (see Appendix 2).
Besides its major meaning of possession ((238)-(239)), the Proprietive form can be used for predicating or attributing existence.

5.5.2. The Stative form
The copula δ- 'be' (12.1.1.2) has the bound variant +ijδ-, which
can be used to create the Stative form 'be X'. The Stative form
is not very common for genuine Yukaghir nouns (5.5.2.1); yet this
marking appears to play a major role in borrowing of Russian
adjectives (5.5.2.2).
5.5.2.1. Stative marking with Yukaghir nouns. The Stative form
signifies an acquirable and/or transient state of a person:

5.5.2.2. Stative marking with borrowed Russian adjectives. In
contrast with the Yukaghir qualitative verbs (^.3.2), Russian adjectives are nominal, a fact which is obviously perceived by Yukaghirs (given their native or near-native competence in Russian,
see 2.2). In order to overcome this contradiction, the Stative form
is employed when a Russian adjective is inserted into a Yukaghir126Chapter5. Nominalmorphologysentence. In this way, the Russian adjectives are ""transformed""
into Yukaghir qualitative verbs:
(243) a. äjarasno+rjö-d'elegul-ekä-meleCP various+STAT-ATTR food-PRED make-OF:3SG'He made a variety of food again.' [F26] (Russian
razn(yj) 'different, various'
b. lebie-n+emejcisto+ijö-genearth-ATTR+motherclean+STAT-ATTR'Let the mother earth be clean.' [F34] (Russian
chist(yj) 'clean').

make-lPFV-3PL:OF'That thing, the upward slope, they make steep places
that way.' (Russian krut(oj) 'steep').
The Stative form is employed for a new Russian-based modal construction with nado 'is necessary' (see 0.2.7.1, 11.1.2) and constitutes the morphological basis for the Transformative form (5.5.3)5.5.3. The Transformative form
The Transformative form is created by means of the elements -rjö-t
οτ-ηδ-η, which can be morphologically analyzed as the Imperfective converb of the Stative (as in (242)) and the Stative-based
adverb (see ^.3.3, 4-2) respectively. These variants are used more
or less in the same way, showing at most some tendencies towards
a semantic distribution, rather than a clear semantic distinction.
Most often, the Transformative is used as an argument of the
verb kude- 'to become, to happen, to begin' (see 12.1.3.1.1). In
this function the two variants of the form are semantically equal
('to become X, to turn into X'), see (244)-(245). The form in -t is
commonly followed by the variant gude- of the verb (see 5.2.1.2)
and (245b)).","[137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"
"589meanings are expressed morphologically (see 6.3). See also 2.1 for an
alternative complementation pattern for the verbs of termination.
Thus, this construction might be described in terms of subject-tosubject raising.
Note that the nominal complement of an intransitive verb of termination fills the S slot of the matrix clause; in the pattern with converb, this
slot is filled by the primary participant of the complement clause situation. Thus, this construction might be described in terms of subjectto-subject raising.
See 9.2.7.2.3 for the alternative pattern for the verb erd'i- 'want'.
The Applicative may be thus taken as a morphological marking of the
subject-to-object or object-to-object raising.
There is a single interview example of relativization of the Dative constituent (with the Passive Attributive form, see 6.1.3.3), yet there is
no text evidence confirming this possibility. It should be noted that the
relativization of constituents other than core participants belongs to the
class of phenomena which do not lend themselves to reliable ""interview""
investigation, at least not in the case of Yukaghir; the only thing which
can be said is that such constructions are not produced readily and are
not attested in texts. No statements of absolute grammatical constraints
can be made; yet even if such constructions are grammatically possible,
they are far more ""marginal"" then Locative relativization and Possessor
relativization.
The only attested example is controversial, see comments to the sentence
in (745).
Note that in this example the Russian word svad'ba 'wedding' is used
instead of the Yukaghir Action Nominal form n'e+mid'ul 'talcing each
other' with apparently similar meaning, which makes it possible to suggest that here this word refers not to the action itself, but to the place
of festive activities.
Note that for same-subject situations, this meaning is expressed by
means of the Perfective Converb, see 10.2.2.
Otherwise, the causal relationship can be expressed by means of the
Imperfective SS form; see 10.2.4.1.
This property distinguishes a nominal predicate with the bound copula
from the Stative form constructed with the same marker (see 5.5.5.2).
Note that Predicative marking on the object is impossible in this construction, presumably because of the Predicative marking on the verb
form.
Krejnovich (1982:208-209) considers this construction a part of the
Focus-marking system (for A Focus marking, which cannot be achieved
by means of the regular grammatical Focus construction, see 12.2.1).",[607]

Functions of the Nominal clauses are described in 11.1 and

Note that postpositional phrases, NPs in oblique cases and adverbs
cannot serve as modifiers in Kolyma Yukaghir, with a few minor
exceptions. 38 To some extent, their potential semantic functions
are taken over by unmarked modifiers, which cover a fairly wide
range of semantic relationships (see (561), (562)). On the other
hand, an ""oblique"" modifier can be introduced by means of a relative clause, most notably, by an existential (545a) or a Proprietive
(545b) relative clause.

A possible exception is Dative modifiers, which are attested in a
few examples in my corpus. Such a modifier can both precede
and follow the head noun. Presumably, this is a new construction
which has arisen due to the influence of Russian. Some examples:

Note, however, that the same semantic relationships between NPs
can be rendered by the regular unmarked or Attributive modifier
(see 2.1, 2.3).
Besides, the substantivized pronouns jen+ben 'other (than)'
and irkil+l'e 'one (of)' can take the Ablative modifier (see 7.1.4.6,
7.2.1.1).
1.2. Word order in the noun phrase
Noun phrases are head-final (see Sections 2-3); the order of noun
modifiers conforms, with few exceptions, to the following scheme:
( 5 4 7 ) DEMONSTRATIVE + QUANTIFIER + POSSESSIVE PRONOUN
+ ATTRIBUTE + HEADwhere ""attribute"" stands for any lexical modifier, be it an NP or a

"Grammaticalizedcoreference phenomena5171.3. Chain-level phenomena
1.3.1. Summary
1.3.1.1. Switch reference. On the level of clause chains, the major means for marking coreference are the same-subject forms (see
6.1.4, JO.1.1, 12.2.4): if a non-finite clause has the same primary
(subject) participant as the controlling clause, a same-subject form
must be used. The reverse rule (i.e., the rule which ensures the
different-subject marking in a non-finite clause with a primary
participant different from that of the controlling one) has some exceptions which are described in this section. Such deviations from
the strict subject-oriented switch-reference rules occur if the whole
chain can be thought of as having the same topic (although different primary participants are involved in its component clauses);
see, for example, the first chain in (897). Most instances of this
phenomenon appear to be triggered either by topicalization of the
grammatical Possessor (1.3.2) or, less frequently, by the SF marking in the finite clause (1.3.3).
It should be noted that phenomena of this sort are quite predictable in a spoken language with no conventionalized written
variety. However, the number of examples that show violations of
strict grammatical motivation of switch reference is surprisingly
small.
1.3.1.2. Shared participants. If a chain contains a shared participant with a constant case role, it can be expressed by one (and
only one) NP, i.e., if it is overtly expressed in one clause, it must
be dropped in all other clauses of the chain. Normally, such a
participant is introduced in the chain-initial clause (10.1.3.3). In
a few cases, however, a highly accessible referent is omitted in
the initial clause (s) but is expressed by an NP in the finite clause
(897). Such a structure appears to be employed to signal a low degree of semantic cohesion between clauses. For instance, in (897)
the overt subject NP in the finite clause of the last chain precludes the same-event interpretation (10.2.4.2) of the preceding
SS clause, i.e., it indicates that 'discussing' and 'saying' are two
separate subsequent events (not two aspects of the same event).","[534, 535]"
"The effect of languagecontacton KolymaYukaghir254. The effect of language contact on Kolyma Yukaghir
The most important contact languages have been Yakut and Russian. Now the contact with Russian is more significant. Russian
loanwords play an eminent role even in the Yukaghir everyday
vocabulary, e.g.:
(13) Yukaghir
terike
korobe
s0stok
uzzuo'wife, old woman'
'cow'
'staff'
'gun'Russian
starukha
korova
shestok
ruzhjoNow Russian lexical items are being borrowed practically without
phonetic changes. Moreover, the borderline between the Yukaghir
lexicon and the Russian one is likely not to be ""taken into account""
in the course of natural communication: almost nobody hesitates
to insert a Russian word into a Yukaghir utterance. In contrast
with this, the words borrowed earlier (like those given in (13)) used
to be changed according to the Yukaghir phonetic rules and generally preserve their Yukaghir phonetic form in the contemporary
speech.
The instances of occasional code-mixing are numerous, cf. the
following examples (Russian grammatical and lexical items are in
boldface):
(14) a. potomu6to bogatyj-r/o:-t[becausetudel tamun-rjö-t

go:lMP house-DAT
'Go home!' [F36]
None of the Russian items involved in these utterances can be
viewed as integrated into Yukaghir grammar and/or lexicon; these
examples are intended just to represent a possible source of contact
changes. Yet some grammatical items of Russian origin are used
very regularly and can be assumed to have replaced their original
Yukaghir counterparts. One of the most notable examples is the
Russian intensifier sam 'self' (in various phonetic forms):
(15) a. sam el-ozä-nu-j
self NEG-drink-IPFV-INTR:3SG
'He himself didn't drink.' [K4]
b. tude-gele kudde-m
tude-sam äj amde-j
[he-ACC kill-TR:3SG] [he-self
CP die-lNTR:3SG]
'He killed that one and died himself, too.' [K3]
Cf. the Yukaghir emphatic form of personal pronouns marked by
the suffix -id'ie, e.g., tude-l 'he' > tud-id'ie 'he himself'.
In the most general terms, the effect of Russian contact on
Kolyma Yukaghir grammar can be described as a shift from original Yukaghir synthetic grammatical patterns to newly introduced
analytical patterns. In some cases, the new pattern involves a
grammatical item borrowed from Russian. For example, obligative modality is now expressed almost exclusively by a construction with a Russian predicative loanword nado 'is-necessary' and a
nominalized form of a verb (as in (16a)), which is rapidly replacing
Yukaghir modal suffixes (the old pattern is illustrated by (16b)),
e.g.:
(16) a. tamun min-gi
nado

'It is necessary to take it.'

3. R e l a t i v e clauses
There are two types of constructions involving a non-finite clause
as a noun modifier, Nominal relative construction and Attributive
relative construction. In the Nominal relative clause the subject
of the relative clause is construed as the grammatical Possessor of
a nominal verb form. In the Attributive relative clause, this is not
the case; on the contrary, the subject of the relative clause can be
construed as the grammatical Possessor of the relativized NP (see
P. 1.2.1 for examples).
Nominal relative clauses are formed by the Action Nominal
form or by the Result Nominal form. Attributive relative clauses
are formed by means of the dedicated Attributive forms (£.1.2)
or the Action Nominal form. Thus, the Action Nominal is used
in both relativization strategies. These constructions are formally
distinguished by the placement of the Possessive marker crossreferencing the subject of the relative clause: in the AttributiveRelative clauses417relative construction, it is placed on the head noun, in the Nominal
relative construction, on the verb form itself.
The Attributive relative clause is the primary relativization
strategy, i.e., this strategy is used for subject relativization (3.1).
The Nominal relative clause plays a rather marginal role and is
employed primarily for relativization of spatial and temporal adverbials (3.2).
3.1. AttributiverelativeclausesThe instances of Attributive relativization fall into four classes
according to the syntactic role of the relativized constituent: the
subject (3.1.1), the direct object (3.1.2), the spatial or temporal
Locative (3.1.3), and the Possessor of the (intransitive) subject
(3.1.4).
This distribution seems to be typologically remarkable, if not
exceptional, since the primary relativization strategy appears to
be applied for relativization of the highest and the lowest ranks
in the Noun Accessibility Hierarchy (Keenan and Comrie 1977).83
Two major factors may have determined the attested distribution:
• The accessibility of spatial and temporal adverbials is supported by the existence of the minor Nominal relativization
strategy (see 3.2), which can use the same morphological resources (Action Nominal form).
• Possessor relativization seems to be related to topicalization
by means of Possessive marking (see 8.2.2.2), i.e., it may be
accounted for in terms of Topic relativization.
Generally, the verb forms do not mark the case role of the relativized constituent. However, they show some sort of (not fully
grammaticalized) orientation toward various types of constituents:
• The Passive Attributive form cannot be applied for relativization of the subject and the Possessor.
• The Active Attributive form is not used for Locative
relativization. 84418Chapter 11. Subordination• The Action Nominal is almost never employed for relativization of the direct object (the only text example is given in
(742)).
As all noun modifiers, the relative clause precedes its head, but it
can be (very rarely) shifted to the clause-final position (after the
verb); see (744b).
3.1.1. Subject relativization
The subject can be relativized by means of the Active Attributive
form (737) or the Action Nominal form (738). The factors which
determine the choice of one or another form seem to be correlated
with grammatical Focus marking; more specifically, the Active
Attributive form is preferred if the NP as a whole is marked for
grammatical Focus. Both constructions are available for S (sentences (a)-(b) in (737)-(738)) and A (sentences (c)-(d)).

contrast between the Attributive and the Nominative marking of
noun modifiers, see 8.2.3.
5.1.2. The Possessive Attributive form
Nouns and Nominal forms of verbs have the Possessive Attributive
form in -de ~ -te, which can be combined with the Plural marker.
This marker cross-references the Possessor if the Possessed itself
serves as a modifier.
5.1.2.1. Formation of the Possessive Attributive. There is an alternative variant of the Possessive Attributive form, which is built by
the combination of the Possessive marker -gi- ~ -ki- and the regular Attributive marker. This variant occurs very rarely (there are
only two examples in my corpus) and can be considered obsolete.
The examples are:
(231) a. cumut saqal'ä-gi-n+puge
all0rd'e-geassemble-POSS-ATTR+summermiddlen'e+min-rji-te-j
RECP+take-3PL-FUT-iNTR'In the middle of the summer when they all will

grandchildren are multiple.' [K4]
There is no clear difference in meaning between the variants of the
Attributive form, cf., e.g. (231b) and (232).
(232)tamun u0rpe-p-te
thatu0r-pechild-PL-POSS child-PL'These are his grandchildren.' [K4]
Below, only the Possessive Attributive form in -de is described.","[134, 135, 136, 137]"
"The choice between options (la) and (lb) is determined by the
syntactic role assigned to the entity. Subjects are often dropped
(as illustrated by virtually all examples in this grammar), but this
drop is obligatorily compensated by some variant of bound crossreference marking (see (lb)). The following examples illustrate the
omission of the object participant, which is not cross-referenced
within the clause by any morpheme:
(903) a. tieomnisome peoplelegi-te-nu-l'el-rjä
eat-CAUS-lPFV-iNFR-3PL:TR'Some people fed (him).' [Fl]
b. suke-dietatpike-DlM CAesken-l'-ie-l'el-u-m
attack-0-iNGR-lNFR-0-TR:3SG'The pike attacked (him).' [Tl]
An argument of a postposition, if omitted, must be represented
by the Possessive marker on the postposition (5.5.1):
(904) a. como+cohojo-gi
big+knife-POSSal'-de-geqodö-jAD-POSS-LOC Iie-INTR:3SG'His lance was lying next to him.' [F49]
b. tämolho-de-get h e r e IN-POSS-LOCs0j-l'el
enter-lNFR(3SG)'He entered inside it.' [F44]
The Possessive marking on one constituent can serve to represent another (dropped) participant of the same situation, i.e., an
obligatory participant that is not referred to explicitly tends to be
interpreted as referentially identical to the entity represented by a
Possessive marker within the same clause (or clause-chain):524Chapter 14- Coreference and discourse(905)coherencea. qäqä-gi
mid'-u-m
grandfather-POSS take-0-TR:3SG
'Hisj grandfather took (him,).'
b. legul-pe-giädelletadi-ginado[[food-PL-POSS make-SS:PFv] give-poss] necessary
'It is necessary to make and give (them*) their;
food.' [F9]
Generally, the options outlined under I through VI above can be
viewed as a hierarchy reflecting the accessibility of the referent
(topic continuity). However, at least two other factors are in play.
First, if the participant role assigned to the entity changes in the
given clause, it is likely to be referred to by an overt NP. If the
role changes from non-primary to primary, a lexical NP is likely
to be chosen:
(906)tabun-ge
tintaij

run.out-PFV-3PL:iNTR'Then that old man, the owner of the house, said to his
daughters;: ""Bring your friend inside!"" Those two girls;

If the primary participant of the previous clause is assigned a nonprirtiary role in the given clause, it is likely to be referred to by a
pronoun:

tud-in
family-ATTR+elder-PL-LOC [he-DAT

him. The elder of family would say to them: . . . ' [Kl]
Secondly, the choice of one or another option can be influenced by
the degree of coherence between clauses: if the situation described
by the given clause does not belong to a coherent sequence of actions, its participants are likely to be referred to overtly. This
effect is illustrated by the following example, where the entity introduced by an NP in the first clause is represented by the personal
pronoun in clauses involving some slight ""gaps"" in discourse coherence (shift to a ""background description"" in clause [2] and back to
the sequence of imperative sentences in [4]), and by zero otherwise,
although its accessibility clearly remains the same in all clauses.

A detailed description of these factors is outside the scope of this
grammar. See also 7.1.2.2.2, 12.3.2.3 on the difference between
the demonstrative and personal pronouns.
2.1.2. Situations
The major means of referring to a previously described situation
within a clause describing another situation are nominal demonstrative pronouns (7.1.2.2.3); the pronoun tabun ~ tamun 'that'
can replace Nominal clauses in the complement function (909a)
and in the adverbial function (909b):526Chapter 14- Coreference(909) a. tabun

into gulls.' [F31]
The Locative form of this demonstrative has a function which cannot be derived from the meanings of the constituent morphemes:
it is regularly used in order to indicate that the situation described
by the given clause is a reaction to the actions of another participant, most often, to utterances or requests:
(910) a. ibil'e-tolmon cel'uzu-j.[cry-SS:IPFV] rightweep-lNTR:3SGtintaij nume-n'e-lpulutthat[house-PRPR-ANR] o l d . m a ntamun-ge

thatold.man""Share your hare with me!"" she said. In response, the
old man gave her a half of it.' [Fl5]
The situation just described can also be resumed in the next clause
by the combination of the connective adverb tat (see 7.1.2.2.4) and
the verb I'e- 'be' (911a)-(911b) or, less frequently, ä- 'make' (911c)
or kude- 'become' (912).102Paragraph-levelphenomena527The expressions tät+1'e- and tät+ä- normally take the form of
the initial clause in a clause chain and establish a link between
the preceding finite clause and the rest of the chain. The switchreference markers thus indicate whether the subject of the preceding finite clause is similar to or different from that of the next
clause:

The expression tat kude- (tat gude-) is most often used as a Nominal clause:528Chapter 14- Coreference and discourse(912)titcoherencetat gudie-l-5l-geleqojlaji[you CA become-O-RNR-ACc]GodCPju0-te-m
see-FUT-TR:3SG'God will see that you have done this.' [K4]
See also Section 3 on the connective function of the form tat. Note
that these means of referring to a previously described situation
are generally not applied if the main predicate of the given sentence
is the same as in a preceding clause (for this case, see 2.2).
2.2. Links between same-type situations
There are several grammatical means to combine or to establish
an explicit link between clauses referring to semantically similar
situations, i.e., situations which can be signified by means of the
same verb (in a particular case, between clauses describing the
same referential situation). Such a link can be established either
by means of a connective particle (2.2.1-2.2.2) or by using a single
verb form for both situations (2.2.3).
2.2.1. The connective particle äj ~ ajt 'too, again, still'
The particle äj is employed to link a clause to a clause referring to
a (semantically) similar situation, most often signified by the same
verb. In the simplest case, the situations linked by means of this
particle are just two occurrences of the same situation, with the
same sets of participants. In this case the particle can be glossed
as 'again' (if the clause describes the second occurrence of the
situation, (913), (914)) or 'too' (if it describes the first occurrence
(914)). The clauses involved need not be adjacent (e.g., in (913a)
two instances of the particle refer back to two different preceding
clauses). The particle takes the preverbal position:
(913) a. tamun-getarj[that-LOC t h a tpulutäjmezze-j-delleäjold.manCP awake-PFV-ss:PFv]CP0rn'e-ri-l'ie-nu-l'el-u-m

b. pulut,
pulut,
äj kimdän'e-jek
old.man old.man CP Iie-INTR:2SG
'Old man, old man, you are cheating again.' [F19]
If such clauses are adjacent, the particle can occur in both of them
(914a). Note that the linear order of the clauses can be reversed
with respect to the temporal order of the situations (914b):

The same particle can link clauses describing similar situations
with distinct sets of involved participants. The examples in (915)
illustrate the case where the situations differ in one participant
slot. In (916), the participants are rearranged with respect to
their roles in the situation. If the NP representing the changed
participant is not adjacent to the verb form, the particle normally
takes the postnominal position (916b) (otherwise, the preverbal
and postnominal positions cannot be distinguished). If this NP
is marked as the grammatical Focus, the particle takes the prenominal position (see (915d), (919a)). 104530Chapter14- Coreference(915) a. δζϊand discourseel+jükewatercoherencel'e-t-ikind'eNEG+far be-FUT-lNTR:3SG| moonäjl'e-t-iCPbe-FUT-INTR:3SGpod'erqo

In a few cases, this particle establishes a link between a finite
clause and a non-finite clause within the same sentence:

The variant ajt is used if the clause does not describe another
occurrence of a situation, but the same protracted situation (which
is thereby marked to take place still, although the time reference
has changed). The variant äj can occur in this case as well. In this
context, the particle can be glossed as 'still' or 'yet', depending on
whether the clause is positive or negative:

"1.3.1.2. Another piece of evidence in favor of the distinction between the linear structure and nesting is given by switch-reference
marking. As shown in 1.1.1, switch reference is normally controlled
by the next clause, which implies identical syntactic relationships
in all pairs of adjacent clauses. On the other hand, if a nonfinite clause is embedded in its controlling clause, it is likely not
to exhibit the controlling properties with respect to the foregoing
clause, that is, switch reference in a clause which precedes a nesting subchain must be controlled by the matrix clause, rather than
by the embedded one. This seems to be the case in (688):

el+amde-yi
NEG+die-3PL:INTR'They went (further), (but) a very big bird came, so
that they almost died from fear.' [F9]
In this example, the DS clause does not control switch reference in
the initial clause; instead, the controlling function is taken over by
the next clause of the chain. Hence, it may be assumed that the
DS clause is embedded in its controlling clause, and the resulting
nesting structure functions as a single unit in the overall linear
structure of the chain. It should be noted that reliable examples
of this sort are very rare.
1.3.2. Merged clauses
Some chaining constructions are arranged in such a way as to
place all the participants involved before all the verb forms. In
effect, the clauses are merged to create a structure quite similar to
the single-clause construction, the only difference being that the
(complex) situation is described by means of several (chained) verb
forms. This structure is easily identifiable if some participant ofTypes of clause chaining379the controlling clause is not involved in the switch-reference clause
situation, but nonetheless precedes the switch-reference verb form.

'Then all the gods gathered and separated Middle
Earth from Low Earth by raising it upward.' [F9]69
The merged structure can be viewed as a particular case of nesting. However, it is available under stronger syntactic conditions:
the merged clauses must share the core participants, with constant case roles, i.e., both situations must involve the same primary participant and, if transitive, the same Ο participant (689).
This structure appears to be associated with the tightest semantic
cohesion between clauses (see 2.4).
1.3.3. Structural ambiguity of clause chains
The structural options outlined in 1.3.1-1.3.2 are distinguishable
only if the chain contains an NP which demonstrably belongs to
the controlling clause, but not to the switch-reference clause, since
the linear position of such an NP can indicate the degree of structural cohesion between clauses. Yet most instances of clause chaining simply do not contain NPs which would be able to signal the
type of structure involved. This structural ambiguity is a direct
consequence of two basic syntactic properties of Yukaghir, the extensive use of zero anaphora and the verb-final order.
Indeed, if a shared participant with nonconstant case role is380Chapter 10. Clausechainingomitted, the distinction between the linear and the nesting structure (see 1.3.1.1) is neutralized, cf. (690) and (687).

'He came closer to the fireplace, and she recognized
him.'
On the other hand, if all participants of the controlling clause situation are involved in the switch-reference clause situation in the
same case roles (691), they are likely to precede all verb forms
independently of the structural option involved. Given the verbfinal word order, a chain-initial NP representing a shared participant may be taken to belong to either clause (and be dropped
in the other), or otherwise to the merged complex as a whole (as
in (689)). In (691), the linear analysis is represented with square
brackets, the nesting analysis, with curly brackets.

The structural ambiguity of most ordinary chains appears to be
an essential property of this strategy of clause linking (rather than
an artifact of inadequate tools of syntactic analysis). Instead of a
strict formal opposition between co-ordination and subordination,
the clause-chaining offers a rather flexible device for combining
clauses exhibiting various degrees of backgrounding and semantic
cohesion (see 2.3-2.4).","[396, 397, 398]"

As described in 5.3.1.2.5, from the phonological point of view, the
Attributive form cannot be considered a fully free word form (givenNominalderivation135the possible alternation -d ~ -n under phonological conditions determined by the head noun). That is why it is not easy to delineate
noun phrases with Attributive dependent nouns and compounds
based on the same structural scheme (see examples (230)). What
has to be stated is that there are such collocations with the following properties (which distinghuish these collocations from those
described in 5.1.1):
1. The meaning of the combination is not predictable from the
meanings of its components.
2. Before a vowel-initial stem, only the variant -d of the Attributive marker is allowed; its alternation with -n is allowed (and
required) only before a consonant.
3. With respect to the Possessive marking, the collocation behaves like a single noun stem, i.e., the Possessive marking on
the Attribute (the Possessive Attributive form, see 5.1.2) is
disallowed.

both, so that a form like äce-p-ki
(deer-PL-3(NOM)) is ambiguous

Nouns have an Attributive form in -d/-n which can be used
only non-referentially (e.g., äce-n legul 'deer-food, food for deer')
and two ""verbal"" forms, the Proprietive form, which is built by
means of the suffix -n'e- ~ -n'- (äce-n''to have (a) deer, to be
with deer'), and the Stative form derived by the bound variant
+i)öof the copulative verb δ- 'to be' ( ä c e + η δ - 'be (a) deer').
Nouns also have a Transformative form which is derived from
the Stative form by means of the suffix -n/-t, e.g., äc.e+i)5-n
'as
a deer, (become) a deer', a Privative form built by the combination of the standard negative prefix el- and the postfix
+cu0n,
e.g., el+ace+cu0n
'without (a) deer', and an (almost obsolete)
Prospective form, e.g., pulut+mozu
'fiance' (from pulut
'husband').
There is a number of nominal derivational suffixes, only two
of which are productive, the Diminutive, -die-, e.g., äce-die
'little deer' and the Augmentative, -tege- ~ -the-, e.g., äce-tke
'large

2.2.2. Verbs
Verbs fall into two major classes, transitive and intransitive. Each
class has two series of Indicative finite forms, for main clauses
which are neutral with respect to grammatical Focus (Main forms)
and for clauses with intransitive subject (S) or direct object (O)
marked for grammatical Focus (SF and OF forms, respectively).
The finite verb agrees in person/number with the subject (the OF
paradigm and especially the SF paradigm are less distinctive than
the Main one). The Imperative is expressed by a distinct series
of forms, which are shared by transitive and intransitive verbs.
Illustrative paradigms are given in Table 3 (for the verbs modo'sit, stay' and ä- 'make').
There are Interrogative forms which are used only in questionword questions in which the questioned constituent is not S / O (in
the latter case, the respective Focus-indicating forms are used).
For the first person subject, there are special Interrogative person
markers, -m LSG, -ök LPL. The second and third person Interrogative forms differ from the Main Indicative forms only in absence of
the (in)transitivity morphs -j(e)- / -m(e)- (e.g., (qodo) ä-k '(how)
you (SG) made', (qodo) ä-met '(how) you (PL) made', (qodo) ä
'(how) he made', (qodo) d-iji '(how) they made').
The verb morphology is clearly aspect-dominated; the regularly
marked aspect meanings are Imperfective, Ingressive, Resultative,
and Habitual:6(2)Chapter1.","[22, 23, 24]"
"Numerals261The cardinal numerals from 11 to 19 consist of ΊΟ' + Ί , 2, 3,
. . . ' + the postposition budie 'over, above', with certain morphological changes, e.g., kun+irku-budie 'eleven', kun+ataqun+budie
'twelve, kun'il+jäl+budie 'thirteen', etc. Yet such compounds are
mostly replaced by the corresponding Russian numerals.
The cardinal numerals from 20 to 100 are built as the combination of the Attributive form of the respective simple numeral and
the noun kun'el' 'ten', e.g., ataq-un kun'el '20', jä-n kun'el '30',
kun'-in+kun'el '100' etc. The number of hundreds is expressed by
a postpositional phrase with budie (SUPER) following the numeral
'100':

This construction is almost always replaced by a construction with
the word sto or isto, from the Russian sto 'hundred', e.g., jä-d-isto
~ jä-n+sto '300'.
Other numerals between these are built as simple combinations
of numerals for tens and the numerals from 1 to 9:

this alternation) occur when a numeral is used as a noun modi-262Chapter7. Morphologyof closedclassesfier. The numerals for 'five' and 'nine' do not have the noun-like
Attributive form, hence the Attributive form of the respective cardinal verb is used in this function (494c). The numeral for 'ten' is
commonly used attributively in the Nominative form (lacking for
other numeral stems), (494d).

use of these verbs):

"Kolymaand Tundra Yukaghir27Another subclass of these contact phenomena comprises various
expansions of Russian-like grammatical patterns construed by
means of Yukaghir morphology, which squeeze out Yukaghir synthetic patterns and take over their functions. For example, Yukaghir has a verbal suffix -ji- designating movement in order to
perform the action denoted by the stem. This suffix can occur
either in a finite verb form as in (17a), or in a same-subject form
dominated by a verb of movement as in (17b). Both patterns are
being rapidly replaced by a construction with the Supine, similar
to t h a t found in many European languages (including Russian),
e.g. (17c):
(17) a. tabud-ek
ju0-ji-mele
this-PRED look-PURP-OF:3SG
'He went to look at this.'
b. ays 'i-ji-t

'He went to look for it.'
c. arjs'i-din
kewe-s'
search-SUP go-3SG:INTR
'He went to look for it.'
Although the construction with the Supine is hardly new for
Kolyma Yukaghir, it can be assumed to have been a marginal
device for expressing this situation type until recently. Now, it is
the most common and frequently applied option, while the patterns represented in (17a)-(17b), having no structural parallel in
Russian, are squeezed out.
Similar phenomena are found in almost all fragments of Yukaghir grammar and will therefore be described in detail in the
respective sections of the book. In general, I will try to present
modern Kolyma Yukaghir as it is used in everyday communication
(that is, by Yukaghirs over 55-60).
5. K o l y m a a n d T u n d r a Yukaghir
The Kolyma and Tundra Yukaghir languages used to be described
as dialects, which seems to be misleading in view of the significant28Chapter 2. KolymaYukaghir and its speakersdistinctions in lexicon, grammar, and phonology. Presumably due
to the extensive language contacts, the lexical distinctions even
within the basic vocabulary are so great that glottochronological
counts give ca. 2000 years of divergence (Nikolaeva and Helimsky
1997:155-156). The grammatical divergent features seem to have
been underestimated in previous studies of Yukaghir, probably
because neither of the grammars was known well enough. That
is why both existing monographs on Yukaghir (Krejnovich 1958;
1982) treat the two languages together, although some divergent
features are mentioned. The present grammar deviates from this
tradition and treats Kolyma Yukaghir as a distinct language to be
described in its own right.","[44, 45, 46]"
"NotesThat approach is not accepted in this grammar because of significant
differences in the role these constructions play in the grammar and discourse. Most importantly, the construction with the Result Nominal
is not obligatory in the environments which trigger compulsory Focus
marking on the S/O participant (see 12.3.1); see also (Maslova 1997)
for further details.
The ""locative"" pattern for predication of possession is presumably induced or at least strongly supported by Russian influence, where such
a pattern constitutes the major option.
Note that a logically possible variant of dealing with such a situation
would be to put the Focus Ο constituent in the clause-initial position,
before the A constituent (which would have been then included into
the scope of assertion). Yet this variant is prohibited by the word-order
rules, i.e., this constituent order is not allowed in the Focus construction;
see 5.1.5.1.
This ne can be assumed to be just the Russian negative marker.
Krejnovich (1982:151) gives the whole person/number paradigm of this
verb, yet all forms but those of second person appear to be out of use.
In most instances these word order options cannot be distinguished (just
because the subject is very often omitted).
For examples of questions to the S/O constituent, see 1,8.3.1.1.
Note that the phonological integrity of the complex qodo-l'e- is indicated
by the alternation of the final / e / with /&/ before the inferential marker,
which shows that the stem as a whole belongs to the class of back stems,
see 5.2.4.1).
The combination el+jüke can be fused into ejüke 'not far'.
The interrogative pronoun kin 'who' does not take the negative prefix.
This use of the manner question word is quite typical for colloquial
Russian.
Note that the possessive relationship between the subject of the main
clause and that of the subordinate clause is expressed by means of the
bound (non-reflexive) Possessive marking (see (893)).
Note that the verbs I'e- 'be' and ä- 'make' can also combine with Interrogative adverbials to build questions to predicates (15.2.2.2).
The omitted piece of the text represents the direct speech (what the
brother was saying while he was crying).
Thus, the grammatical Focus shows a predicate-like behavior; see 12.2
on the syntactic status of the Focus.
Thus, such a quantifier shows the same behavior as the grammatical
Focus; see 8.3 on the semantics of this construction.
Note that the comitative strategy of NP conjunction implies the singleevent interpretation.",[608]
"202Chapter6. Verbmorphology3.5.2.2. Ingressive and Internal Aspect. Quite predictably, in a
number of cases, the Iterative (= Internal Imperfective) marking is
a necessary prerequisite for the Ingressive formation, since the nonIterative counterpart of an Iterative stem presents an event as a
single (bounded) whole and therefore does not allow the Ingressive
derivation.

'shoot'
'pour'
'rise, climb'
'arrive, reach'The Iterative derivatives in such clusters can represent different
specific aspectual modifications of the initial event (see 3.3.2); yet
these distinctions seem to be neutralized by the Ingressive marking, so that their only semantic impact is to impose a ""process""
interpretation:

However, it is not the case that the classification of verb stems
implied by Ingressive marking wholly matches the morphological classification, as determined by Internal Aspect marking and
outlined in 3.3. In particular, the Perfective marker is, in some
exceptional cases, compatible with the Ingressive:

be marked for Imperfective in the regular way (see 3.2):

leij-de-de
[eat-DETR-SS:ITER]'Then they would begin to dance for several days,
sometimes drinking tea, sometimes eating.' [Kl]
3.5.2.4. Inchoative. The Ingressive suffix is compatible with some
stative stems, the resulting meaning being inchoative (a process
which results in the state signified by the verb stem):
(387)im-äbe.on-iNGRjorjz-asleep-iNGRjowl'-äbe.ill-iNGRirji-l'-iebe.afraid-O-lNGR-'get up on (a deer, a sledge, etc)'
'fall asleep'
'become ill''get afraid'In some cases, the Ingressive suffix is opposed to the Stative suffix
(see 6.3.6.3), while the morphologically unmarked counterpart is
absent, cf. al'-δ- 'be molten' vs. al'-a- 'melt, become molten';204Chapter 6. Verb morphologyoh-o- 'stand' vs. 0g-ie- 'stand up'.
3.5.3. Inchoative suffixes
3.5.3.1. The Inchoative suffix -mu- (Krejnovich 1982:106). The
suffix is attached to qualitative verbs (388a). In some cases, it
replaces the Stative suffix -δ- (388b). If the last vowel of the stem
is {E} (5.3.4), it is pronounced as [i] or [u] before the Inchoative
suffix.
cä-mube.few-iNCHembu-mube.black-lNCHligu-mube.old-iNCHikl'i-muhard-iNCHcom-mubig-INCHceru-muslow-INCH-'become few'
'become black'
'grow old'
'become hard' (cf. ikl'-δ- 'be hard')
'grow u p ' (cf. com-δ 'be big')
'become slow' (cf. cer-δ- 'be slow')This suffix is the major and most regular means of expressing
the Inchoative meaning for qualitative verbs; its distribution is
constrained simply by the fact that the class of qualitative verbs
is virtually closed (and some of them take other, far less regular,
Inchoative suffixes; see 6.3.5.3.2). It is worth noting that it can
be attached to a relatively new member of this class, u0+ijö- 'be
young' (the lexicalized Stative form of u0 'child' (see 5.5.5.2)),
although the resulting meaning implies a quite atypical (if not
unrealistic) situation of turning young again:
(389)kus+kin-de
mil-l'el-de-j-ne
[iNDF+who-INDF take-INFR-3SG-DS-CONö]

AFF-IRLS+alive-INGR-INTR:lSGAspect205u0+7]ö-mu-je
child+STAT-INCH-INTR:3SG'If anybody had taken me (as wife), I would have
revived and regained my youth.'
Moreover, my consultants were willing to derive a form like
nado+r/5-mu-j 'become necessary', where nado 'needed' is a recent
borrowing from Russian (although no such examples are attested
in the texts).
To sum up, the Inchoative suffix -mu- appears to function as
a productive morpheme, although its domain of application is
strongly constrained (see Appendix 2).
3.5.3.2. Other Inchoative suffixes are -kie- (see 5.2.4.3.2), -be-,
-l'e-, -ge-, -de-j- (Krejnovich 1982:106-108), each of which is attested for a very restricted group of verbs (see Appendix 2).
(390)n'umud'i-kiepukel'-bekenbe-l'ejube-gekejle-de-j-'become sour' (n'umud'ü- 'be sour')
'become soft' (pukol'-δ- 'be soft')
'become broad' (kenbu-ne- 'be broad')
'stuff oneself' (jube- 'be full with food')
'become red' (kejle-n'- 'be red')The suffix -de-j- can be considered a frozen combination of the
denominal Inchoative Proprietive suffix (see 4.2) and the Perfective
marker (see 3.3.1); see also 4.3.3.3 on this combination. Note
that it is often opposed to the lexicalized Proprietive suffix of
the corresponding qualitative verb (390e), i.e., this subgroup of
qualitative verbs and their inchoative counterparts appear to have
been built from nominal stems (see also Appendix 2).
3.6. Resultative and Stative
3.6.1. The suffix -5The Resultative form is built by means of the suffix -δ-, followed
by the Intransitive agreement markers. The suffix entails the /j/
~ /d'/ alternation in the intransitive morph -j(e)- (see 5.3.3.2). It
is attached to the stem according to the same rules as the Result
Nominal suffix -51- (see 1.3.1, 5.3.5.1).31206Chapter6. VerbmorphologyThe same (or formally identical) suffix -δ- can be singled out
(on various morphological grounds, see 3.6.3) in a number of Stative and qualitative verbs; in this case, both formal and semantic
relations between a stative stem and its dynamic counterpart are
far less regular and predictable (in some cases, there is no such
counterpart).
It seems worth noting at this point that the Resultative and the
Stative belong to a wider range of formally similar items with a
general stative meaning, which includes, in addition to the Result
Nominal, the copula δ- in constructions with nominal predicate
(see 10.2.1.2) and its bound variant +rjö- (in particular, in the
Stative forms of nouns (5.5.5.2)), cf. also 5.3.3.2 for some common
morphophonemic properties of these morphemes (Tailleur 1965:6970; Krejnovich 1982:98-99).
3.6.2. The Resultative
The Resultative signifies an observable state which has resulted
from a situation denoted by the verb stem, either a state of the
single participant of an intransitive situation (391), or of the patient/theme participant of a transitive situation (392). In the latter case, this participant takes the subject position, while the agent
cannot be specified.

'Let bones not lie thrown here and there.' [F34]
b. unuT] saide
tob-5-j
river across lock-RES-lNTR:3SG
'The river is dammed.' [F6]
In this function, the suffix -δ- is quite productive; the Resultative
is available whenever the situation signified by the verb entails an
observable resulting state.
3.6.3. The Stative
The suffix -δ- can be identified in a number of stative and qualitative verbs. In some cases, the Stative verbs are derived from
dynamic verbs, as in (393) (Krejnovich 1982:99); see also 3.5.2.4
and (388b) for cases where the Stative suffix is opposed to an
Inchoative suffix.

meaning being more or less lexicalized):

'be deep'
'be warm'
'be soft'< 0rd'e
< ceginme

'depth'

snowThe semantic relationship between a Stative verb and its dynamic
counterpart can be close to that expressed by the Resultative208Chapter6. Verbmorphologymarker ('a state' vs. 'a situation entailing such a state'). However,
the Stative (in contrast to the Resultative) denotes a state without any reference to a previous event (something can be 'narrow'
without 'having become narrow', etc.).
The Stative suffix can be viewed as a result of lexicalization of
the Resultative form of verbs, on the one hand, and the Stative
form of nouns, on the other (see 3.6.1; cf. also Tailleur 1965:69-70).","[219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226]"

Noun phrase and postpositional phrase1. The structure of the noun phrase
1.1. Overview of NP types
There are three major structural types of NPs: (i) a pronoun, (ii) a
noun with optional preceding modifiers, (iii) a nominalized clause.
These types are briefly introduced in this section, with references
to other parts of the grammar where they are discussed in detail.
Pronouns (in the strict sense, i.e., pro-NPs). This class comprises personal pronouns (7.1.1.1), nominal forms of the
demonstrative and interrogative pronouns (7.1.2.1), the indefinite pronouns sar 'something' (7.1.4.4) and ile 'some'
(7.1.4.5), and the substantivized forms of the modifiers jen
'(an)other' (7.1.4.6), mus'in ~ bucun (7.1.5.2) and irkin 'one'
(7.2.1.1).
Nouns plus (optional) preceding modifiers. The major formal types of modifiers are:
• Unmarked NPs, which may (538c) but need not (538a)(538b) be cross-referenced by the Possessive marker on
the head. Some examples:
(538) a. tat qäqänum0-kCA grandfather house-PREDnum-mele

Nominalized clauses. This class comprises Nominal clauses
(544a) and headless Relative clauses (544b).

"NotesThe term ""clause conjunction"" is used here to refer to any syntactic link
between two or more clauses all of which have the same illocutionary
function.
In the latter function, it is opposed to specialized adverbial clauses, a
relatively minor strategy for clausal modification of propositions (see
IIA,
13.5.3.1).
Some deviations from the strictly subject-oriented switch-reference procedure are described in 14-1.3).
""Perch"" is interpreted as a proper name within the context of this fairy
tale, hence the Nominative form in the Focus position.
In this example, the detransitivized verb leT)-de- 'eat' is used despite the
presence of the direct object; this deviation is presumably entailed by
the Desiderative suffix which is typically used with the detransitivized
verb, but not with its transitive counterpart (leg- 'eat').
The linear structure is posited for the DS clause and the controlling
finite clause. The relation between the SS clause and the DS clause is
more appropriately described in terms of nesting, see 2.4.2 for a further
discussion of such examples.
In this example, the underlined NP fills the Ablative slot of the verb
loijde- 'separate (from)', which is absent from the pattern of the verb
paja- 'carry'.
Note that this application of the ordinary chaining is possible only under
the specific mode of reference (1.2).
This function appears to be fairly typical for sentence-initial temporal
clauses across languages (Thompson and Longacre 1985:212).
See 12.2.4 for a description of ss-chains with shared Focus.
The glosses for predictive conditional constructions are based on the
context, as well on (Russian) translations provided by informants.
In this example, the controller of switch reference is the Possessor of the
finite-clause subject, see 14-1.3.2 for a description of this phenomenon.
This example is one of very few exceptions from the rule of switch reference: the DS form is used despite the shared subject.
The term ""complementation"" refers to constructions where a clause denoting a situation or fact fills a valence slot of the main verb (Noonan
1985:42). Note that two of the three nominal verb forms employed
for complementation, the Result Nominal (6.1.3.4) and the Prospective
Nominal (6.1.3.5), can denote entities as well. In this case, they function like ordinary NPs and can appear in a clause independently of the
valence properties of the main verb. Such constructions are outside the
scope of this section.
However, see 2.2 for a group of verbs taking the Supine complements.
This is the only type of phase verb existing in Yukaghir: other phaseNotes79.

3.1.2. Singular with inherently plural and dual nouns
There are some nominal stems signifying multiple-entity objects,
so that the Singular form refers to multiple entities (140a)-(140b).

the morpheme d't 'people"" (140c).

A number of nouns signifying entities which normally occur in
pairs (e.g., certain body parts, various kinds of shoes, etc.) usually
refer to a pair of entities in the Singular form (141). The singular
meaning is possible as well, but it has to be supported by the
numeral irk-in 'one' (142a)-(142b); another option to indicate the82Chapter 5. Nominalmorphologysingular meaning is the word ejmunde 'half' (142c).

3.1.5. Singular with the verbs ninge- 'be multiple, many', ca- 'be

The Singular form is generally used in the context of scalar verbs
ninge- 'be many' and cä- 'be few' (although the Plural form is also
possible, see 3.2.1):

3.2. Functions of the Plural
3.2.1. Plurality
The Plural form signifies multiplicity of the entities referred to:
(146) a. met tl

3.2.3. Plurality of Possessor
In the context of a Possessive marker, the Plural marker can signify either the plurality of the entities referred to by the noun
itself, or the plurality of the entities cross-referenced by the possessive marker, or both, so that a Possessive Plural form has three
readings, e.g., the form num0-pe-gi can mean 'his houses', 'their
house', or 'their houses'. Some examples:
(150) a. es'ie-pe-gioj-l'e-getitteemej[father-PL-POSS NEG-be-Ds] t h e i r m o t h e razü-gele

Note that in these examples the ambiguity of the Possessive forms
is resolved by means of the verb agreement markers; cf. the Singular different-subject form in (150a) and the Plural finite form in
(150b).
In the Action Nominal (151a) and in the Result Nominal (151b)
form of verbs, the Plural marker signifies the plurality of the subject. In most cases, such forms involve a Possessive marker crossreferencing the subject, yet the Plural marking is also occasionally
possible in the absence of a possessive marker (151c).

3.2.4. Plural marking of collective and uncountable nouns
The Plural marker applied to a collective noun (see 3.1.2) signifies
reference to a set of single entities, that is, this marking implies
the singulative, rather than the collective, reading of the stem.
This usage is common in contexts where some distinct members
of the group are referred to ((152b)-(152c)).

"Formationof major categories75In all cases, the simple stem (without the ""frozen"" Plural morph) is
still in use (126), so that there arises a three-way contrast between
Number forms. The stems k0j 'boy, man', u0 'child' can attach
the Plural marker with the expected plural meaning (127). The
stem paj does not attach the regular Plural marker, i.e., the first
Plural marker cannot signify plurality when attached to this stem.

The ""frozen"" combinations paj-pe, k0j-pe can be used as the Singular forms (128); for the form u0r-pe this is impossible, i.e., it

1.2. Comitative formation
Apart from the Comitative form in -n'e (see Table 10), there used
to be a form in -η'δ (Krejnovich 1982:44, 48), now practically
obsolete. In my corpus, there is only one example of this form:
(130)tätarjci-t[CA search-SS:lPFV]ejre-täce-gi[walk-SS:IPFV]deer-POSSkurceij-n'5 n'ahä
nü-l'el-mele
crane-COM together find-INFR-OF:3SG
'She walked, searched and found his deer (lying)
together with a crane.' [K3]
The functional distinction between the two Comitative forms can
be reconstructed as following: the Comitative in -η'δ used to mark
NPs associated with the non-subject participants, while the form
in -n'e had been used only for ""companions"" of the subject participant. Now, the latter form is easily applied in both environmentsFormationof major categories77(see 4.2.3 for further details).
The suffix -n'E- functions in two modes, as the Comitative
marker and as the Proprietive marker with a meaning like 'have X,
be (provided) with X', where X is signified by the nominal stem
(see 4.2.3, 5.5.1). The combination of the Proprietive and the
same-subject Imperfective suffix -t has been frozen as a distinct
Comitative marker. This complex marker has the form -n'-u-t (n'- + -t) after j+Ej-stems, -n'i-t (< -n'e- + -1) after {+£'}-stems
(see 5.3.4.1.6), cf. säl-n'it 'with a tree' and soromE-n'ut 'with a
man'.
1.3. Possessive forms
The Possessive marker is -Gi in the Nominative, -De- otherwise.
The Possessive sub-paradigm lacks the Predicative case (the Possessive Nominative is used instead; see 4.1.2, 4.1.3).
The combination of the Possessive and the Dative markers results, in the vast majority of cases, in the short form in -d-in. The
full form in -de-r/in is also possible, but occurs only in few cases,
as an optional variant of the short form, e.g., nume-pe-de-ijin ~
nume-pe-d-in 'in/to their house'.
The Accusative marker -gele commonly takes the form -jle after
the Possessive marker. The full variant is also possible, but very
infrequent. The choice of a variant does not depend on the stem,
as shown by the following pairs of forms:
(131)-de-jle
iri-de-jle
n'umud'i-de-jle
qär-de-jle-de-gele
iri-de-gele

1.4.1. Instrumental and Predicative markers
The initial j l j of a case marker is dropped after a consonant. This
is illustrated below by the Instrumental forms.","[92, 93, 94, 95]"
"A few adverbs can take markers of degree, -d'E for the Diminutive
degree (cf. Krejnovich 1982:105), -hote for the Superlative degree.

A few adverbs can derive qualitative verbs by means of the
suffix -mie- (see £.3.6.4.2).
2.2. Locative paradigm
The spatial adverbs have a locative paradigm, which comprises
Locative (unmarked), Prolative, Ablative, and Directional, as
shown in Table 9.
The formal opposition between the Locative, the Prolative, and
the Ablative is quite regular and productive; in particular, a number of recent borrowings from Russian take the Prolative and Ablative marking, cf. bejd'ie 'everywhere' (Russian vezde with the same
meaning), bejd'ie-n, bejd'ie-t. The same opposition constitutes a
fragment of the nominal local inflection (see 5.4.2.5). The formation of the Directional is irregular and involves, in a few cases, the
postposition laiji 'towards' (7.3.2.3) (Krejnovich 1982:159-161).
The functions of these forms are illustrated in (112).

A number of spatial adverbs are formally identical with postpositions (see 7.3).
3. A t t r i b u t e s and properties
3.1. Attributive forms of nouns and verbs
Both nouns and verbs can be used as noun modifiers. A noun
can occur in this position either in the morphologically unmarked
(nominative) form or in the Attributive (non-referential) form in
-d ~ -n:
(113)Unmarked modifiers
meme cuge
'trace of a / t h e bear'

'bear skin'
äce-n 0mgede

saqale-n ferma
'fox farm'For details on nominal modifiers, see 5.5.1, 8.2.
A verb can occur as a noun modifier either in a designated
Attributive form (114) (see 6.1.2) or in the Action Nominal formAttributesand properties67in -I (115) (see 6.1.3.3). The examples in (114) illustrate only the
Active Attributive form in -j(E). For another (Passive) Attributive
form, see 6.1.2.1.

For a detailed description of relative clauses, see 11.3.
3.2. Qualitative verbs
Most words signifying qualities constitute a subclass of verbs (Krejnovich 1982:97-112), insofar as they have the full finite paradigm
(116) (as described 1.2) and all non-finite forms, with the notable
exception of converbs for most qualitative stems (see 3.3 for adverbial use of the qualitative verbs). In particular, these words take
the verbal Attributive (117) or Action Nominal (118) form when
used as noun modifiers (cf. (114)-(115)).","[82, 83, 84, 85]"
"3.6.4. Characteristic suffixes of qualitative verbs
3.6.4.1. The suffixes -bö- and -jo- (both containing the common
'stative' element -Ö-; see 5.3.3.2) derive stative verbs denoting
more or less permanent properties:
(395)lejdi-jdknow-QLTjaqte-jösing-QLTkimd'i-böfight-QLTirji-bobe.afraid-QLT-'be wise'
'be a singer'
'be a warrior'
'be a coward'At least with some verbs, these suffixes are in free variation, e.g.,
both kimd'i-bö- and kimd'i-j5- are attested.
3.6.4.2. The suffix -mie- (Krejnovich 1982:104) derives qualitative
verbs from adverbs:
(396)sobin-miequiet-QLTirjerin-miedifferently-QLTolhin-miedirectly-QLT-'be calm, quiet'
'be unusual, strange'
'be straight, smooth'This suffix derives verbal stems from demonstrative and interrogative adverbials (see 7.1.2.1.5) and from the postposition tite 'like'Aspect209(see 7.3.3). It can also be identified in some synchronically nonderived qualitative verbs, see Appendix 2 for a list of verbs with
this suffix.
3.7. Other aspect-related markers
3.7.1. The Purposive
The Purposive suffix -ji- ~ -d'ej- signifies movement with the purpose to perform the action specified by the verb stem (Krejnovich
1982:152):
(397) a. tatugujel-meegie-delletude[CA morning-ADV stand.up-SS:PFv] hisnonol-gele
ju0-jt-m
snare.trap-ACC see-PURP-TR:3sG
'He got up in the morning and went to look at his
snare trap.' [F15]
b. comölben cuge
arjs'i-jt-te-me
elk
track search-PURP-FUT-OF:lSG
Ί will go in order to look for the track of the elk.'
The Purposive suffix -ji- has the form -d'ej- after consonants, cf.
mon-d'ej- 'go in order to say' (Krejnovich 1982:152); the suffix
induces the / j / ~ jcj alternation in the following morph, e.g.,
jaqte-ji-s' '(he) went in order to sing'.
The suffix is productive, that is, it can be applied whenever
the verb signifies an action which can be carried out intentionally
(of course, except for the verbs of motion), yet it is being rapidly
replaced by constructions with a verb of motion plus the Supine
(supported by the similar Russian pattern), see 11AA.
3.7.2. The Delimitative (verbal Diminutive)
The suffix -s 'ϊ- signifies some sort of diminution of an action (Krejnovich 1982:133, 152); it expresses meanings like 'slightly, shortly,
a little bit', etc., e.g., jerqoge-s'i- 'move' > jerqoge-s'i- 'move
slightly, budge'; morie- 'wear' > morie-s'i- 'wear for a short time,
just a little bit', n'ie- 'call' > n'ie-s'i- 'call weakly, softly, quietly',210Chapter6. Verbmorphologyn'ienund'i- 'ask' > n'ienund'i-si- 'ask for a little bit of something',
etc. The suffix appears to be productive (in the sense that such
forms are easily and readily built by consultants whenever this
seems semantically plausible), but very infrequent.
On the one hand, this meaning is related to Aspect, insofar
as it ""bounds"" the situation by imposing a small span of time
and/or ""smallness"" of the affected object. On the other hand,
the suffix seems to be used to signify some affectionate sympathy
with the (primary) participant (similar to that associated with
the nominal Diminutive). In other words, it is often the primary
participant that is ""diminished"" in some sense, rather than the
action itself. According to my consultants, the suffix is appropriate
when speaking about a child, about an ill person, etc.
4. Valence-changing morphology
4-1. Preliminaries
The structure of this section (and the preceding one) is based on
a semantic (functional) classification of morphemes. This solution
(resulting from the general principles outlined in i.3.1) obscures
some semantic and formal affinities which appear to be very important for Yukaghir verb morphology and have to be mentioned
here.
First, the system of valence-changing in the narrow sense (those
grammatical items which are applied to relational expressions and
modify their valence patterns) employs, to a large extent, the same
set of morphs which are used for derivation of verbs from nominal
stems (see 4.2). Roughly, the same morph can derive Causative
verbs from both verbal and nominal stems (meaning, in the latter
case, 'cause to have X'); see 4.2, 4.3.1 and 4.3.3.1. Similarly, one
morph can derive Stative expressions from both verbs and nouns
(3.6). In other cases, Causative verbs are derived from verbs by a
suffix which, if applied to a noun, derives an intransitive verb with
the meaning 'get, receive X' (see 4.2 and 4.3.3.3). Although the
semantic affinity is less transparent in this case, yet the two types
of valence modification have something in common: the suffix adds
a new valence slot for the agent participant in both environments.","[226, 227, 228]"
