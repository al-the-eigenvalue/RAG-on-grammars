"Can you think of additional ways to achieve topicalization
of particular elements of a sentence? It is very probable that the
use of stress and juncture (cf. 2.6.2 and 2.6.4) play an important
role in topicalization in spoken Chamorro.
PASSIVE V O I C E
4.12The passive voice in Chamorro is not as clear cut as we might like
it to be for purposes of describing the language. Both Costenoble
(1940:314-316) and Safford (1909:61) describe two forms of theSYNTAX257
passive voice. One of the forms uses the infix -in- (which we have
defined as goal focus) while the other uses the prefix ma-. Safford
claims that the passive voice is formed by using -in- when the agent
is singular or dual, and by ma- when the agent is plural. Costenoble sets up a ""subjective genitive passive"" which uses -in- and
an ""objective genitive passive"" which uses ma-.
In our analysis we have stated that the infix -in- is used in goal
focus constructions when there is an agent and when the focus
is on the goal of the action. The passive voice is another construction which uses the prefix ma- and which contains no agent.
The following sentence is an example of a passive voice construction in Chamorro:
Masangan na maolek iya Guam.
'It is said that Guam is good.' or 'They say that Guam is good.'
In this particular sentence it is difficult to ascertain whether
the prefix ma- is actually a passive marker or the third person
plural pronoun ma meaning 'they.' And in most cases it doesn't
make any difference whether the gloss is 'they', as in the English
impersonal 'They say that war is cruel,' or straight passive, as in
'It is said that war is cruel.'
In other cases, however, it is easier to determine that the
verb with the prefix ma- is clearly a passive construction rather
than a verb with the third person plural pronoun. Compare the
grammatical structures of the following two sentences:
(1) Manlinalatde i famagu'on ni ma'estron-niha.
'The children were the ones that were scolded by their teachers.'
(2) Manmalalatde i famagu'on gi eskuela.
'The children were scolded at school.'
Sentence (1) above contains the goal focus infix -in- which places
the emphasis on the goal 'children'. Sentence (2) contains the
passive prefix ma- which also has the effect of placing some emphasis on the goal, but only when there is no subject actor.
If, in the second sentence, the ma- were the subject pronoun
ma meaning 'they,' then the preceding plural marking prefix
man- would not be permitted. Notice the contrast between the
following two sentences:
Ma lalalatde i famagu'on.
'They are scolding the children.'
Manmalalalatde i famagu'on.
'The children are being scolded.'","[268, 269]"
"EARLIER STUDIES OF C H A M O R R O
1.3In addition to the complete listing of studies of the C h a m o r r o
language given in the bibliography, I would like to single out
seven of them for special mention. They are listed in chronological order.
Father Sanvitores. The earliest known grammar of C h a m o r r o
was written by Father Sanvitores in 1668. This work, of considerable interest to the comparative or historical linguist, doubtless
bears the distinction of being the first grammar of any Micronesian language. Written in Latin, it follows the pattern of most
other grammars of the seventeenth century. For example, the
author takes such a word as taotao ' m a n ' and puts it through the
nominative, genitive, dative and accusative cases, even though
the word remains as taotao, with no change, throughout theINTRODUCTION5declension. Father Sanvitores claims to have been divinely inspired to learn Chamorro in an incredibly short period of time.
William Safford. Aside from a Spanish grammar by Mata y
Araujo in 1865, William E. Safford's The Chamorro Language
of Guam (1903-1905) was the next study of the language after
an interim of well over a hundred years. (A Spanish grammar of
Chamorro by del Carmen is reported to have been published in
Manila in 1865, but I have not been able to obtain it.)
Safford was undoubtedly one of the most perceptive Americans ever to visit the Marianas, for after spending only one year
(1899-1900) on Guam as an aide to the first American governor,
he made significant contributions in several areas, notably botany
and language. Considering that he had no previous material to
go by, Safford's two separate works on the plants and language
of Guam are quite remarkable.
No linguist, Safford reacted to this new language in a predictable manner: in addition to making frequent comparisons
with similar words from other Austronesian* languages, he
set up a Latin grammar framework and discussed the features
of Chamorro grammar that would fit into the framework. He
included long lists of ""irregular"" forms of verbs and nouns, but
they were irregular only because Safford did not see the regularity
of the patterns since he was looking at them from the point of view
of Latin grammar.
Fritz, P. Callistus, and Kats. The grammars by Fritz (1909) and
Kats (1917) are basically restatements of Safford in German and
Dutch respectively. N£ither of them contributes anything new,
except for Fritz's accompanying dictionary. Father Callistus,
who was a Capuchin missionary, offered only a dictionary with
an accompanying ""gefasste Grammatik und Sprachiibungen,""
a work doubtless designed for the use of missionaries, and also
based upon Latin grammar.
Von Preissig. E.R. von Preissig, a United States Navy Chief Pay
Clerk who was stationed on Guam, compiled the first EnglishChamorro Dictionary, which was published in 1917. His work
also contains a very short and concise ""grammar,"" the basis of
which is acknowledged to be that of Safford. Von Preissig's
misunderstanding of the complex system of affixation in Chamor*The term Austronesian is now used by most linguists to refer to the family of
languages formerly known as Malayo-Polynesian.","[16, 17]"
"232SYNTAX
Gof yommok i ma'estro.
'The teacher is very fat.'
The rule for the various types of verb phrases in C h a m o r r o
can be summarized by the following representation:+ NP
VP(ModMan)(LOC) (ModTime)This formulaic representation states that a verb phrase can have
any one of the five types of headwords: the transitive verb,
defective verb, intransitive verb, existential verb, or adjective. If
the verb is transitive or defective, it must take a N P object. All of
the verb phrases except those containing an adjective may take
a modifier of manner. All the verb phrases may take the modifiers of location and time.
We will see later in the section on embedded sentences that
some verb phrases include another sentence. For the time being,
the above description will account for most of our basic verb
phrases. The reader can probably think of many examples of verb
phrases that don't follow our rules. Those exceptions will be better understood when we examine the section on the focus system
of Chamorro.
PLURALIZATION
4.7The C h a m o r r o grammar system shows the difference between
plural and non-plural among the verbs, nouns, and pronouns,
and in some cases the adjectives. Notice that the distinction made
here is between plural and non-pural rather than between plural
and singular. This is because Chamorro also distinguishes between
dual and plural in the verb system.
Plural of Intransitive Verbs and Adjectives. All of the intransitive
verbs, existential verbs, and adjectives (when they form a predicate) take the plural marking prefix man- when the subject is
plural, i.e. three or more. If the subject is singular or dual the
plural marker is not used. The following examples will illustrate:
Singular:
Humanao yo' para Saipan.
'I went to Saipan.'","[243, 244]"

Bibliography290282PrefaceThis grammar of the Chamorro language has been in the planning
stage for a long time. Parts of the grammar were presented in my
doctoral dissertation in 1963. Additional pieces were published in
1968. Many scattered fragments were incorporated in the footnotes of Spoken Chamorro (1969). But this is the first attempt on
my part to assemble enough pieces of the language in a sufficiently
systematic way to deserve to be called a reference grammar.
There are, of course, other grammars of the Chamorro
language, some of which are fairly well known. I am indebted to
all of them for insights into the language which I was able to get
from studying them. I do not wish to claim that the present grammar is any better than the earlier ones, but I would like to justify
its compilation (as an addition to the earlier ones) on three counts:
(1) it includes some data that the earlier grammars do not; (2) it
offers a different interpretation of some of the data based upon
more recent concepts in the field of linguistics; (3) it is written
primarily to help Chamorro speakers learn something of the
complexities of their language. It is hoped that interested nonChamorro speakers will also be able to learn something about the
language through studying this work.
Because language is so complex and constantly changing, a
grammar can never be complete. There are usually exceptions to
every rule and new rules are constantly being made by the native
speakers of the language. This grammar is an attempt to describe
the rules of the language, not to prescribe them. All of the rules
given in this book are based on actual language used by numerous
native speakers of Chamorro throughout the Mariana Islands.
In addition to the rules, attempts are sometimes made to ""explain""
the rules—to give the reason for them. In most cases, however, no
explanation is offered simply because there is usually no reason
for any rule in any language.
XIXllPREFACE
Throughout the text can be found ""Notes to Linguists."" In
these sections I have taken the liberty of using slightly technical
terms and concepts for fellow linguists who may be interested in
Chamorro grammar from a scientific point of view. In the main
body of the text I have tried to avoid technical terminology as
much as possible. Where such terms are used they are italicized
and are included in the Glossary of Linguistic Terms at the end of
the book.
While I cannot single out each individual who assisted me in
discovering the grammatical system of the Chamorro language,
I would like to give special thanks to Mrs. Bernadita C. Dungca
(Guam), Mrs. Lagrimas Untalan (Guam), Mr. Pedro M. Ogo
(Rota), Mrs. Rosa Roberto Carter (Guam), and Mr. Jose S.
Pangelinan (Saipan) for their invaluable assistance and patience.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"
"Transitive Verbs. Transitive verbs in traditional terms are verbs
that take a direct object. This claim can also be made for transitive
verbs in Chamorro. Also, we need to make some further specifications about C h a m o r r o transitive verbs.
In a simple, non-focused sentence, when the direct object is
definite then the /iw-type subject pronouns must precede the verb
(cf. 3.4.1 on Pronouns) and the verb stem does not require any
affix. Looked at in another way, a regular transitive verb will
substitute for the verb li'e' in the following sentence:
Hu li'e' i lepblo.
'I saw the book.'
Some examples of verbs that could substitute for li'e'
follows:
Hu li'e' i lepblo.
pacha
yute''I saw the book.'
touched
threw awayare asMORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRtaitai

foundOf course, transitive sentences may also take noun subjects,
in which case the subject pronoun ha must be used with singular
subjects and the pronoun ma is used with plural subjects, as in the
following examples:
I lahi ha li'e' i palao'an.
I lalahi ma li'e' i palao'an.","[96, 97]"
"(Notice that in the last Chamorro sentence three additional
Spanish words occur—kuarenta, tres, ora— in unaltered forms.)
While Spanish may have left a lasting mark on Chamorro
vocabulary, as it did on many Philippine and South American
languages, it had virtually no effect on Chamorro grammar.
German. The German period of influence in the Marianas was
relatively brief (1899-1914) and was confined largely to Saipan.
Since the Germans did not set up an elaborate administrative
system for their new colony, they exerted much less influence,
both cultural and linguistic, than did the Spanish. Very few
German vocabulary items found their way into Chamorro, and
the German influence on Chamorro grammar was nil.
Japanese. Japanese influence on Chamorro was much greater than
that of German, but much less than Spanish. The Japanese
influence, like the German, was pretty well confined to the northern Marianas, especially Saipan. Once again, the linguistic influence was restricted exclusively to vocabulary items, many of
which refer to manufactured objects such as denke' 'flashlight'
and chirigame' 'toilet paper'. Many Saipanese became fluent and
literate in the Japanese language; if the period of Japanese domination of the Marianas had been longer, the linguistic influence
would undoubtedly have been much greater.
English. The influence of English on Chamorro has been great,
especially in Guam. Since 1898, when Captain Henry Glass sailed8INTRODUCTION
The Charleston into Apra Harbor, English has been used in
Guam in an ever-increasing amount. It is the official language of
Guam, is used as the medium of instruction in both public and
private schools, and is used almost exclusively for newspaper,
radio and TV communication. In Guam, most people know
some English, and literacy in English is practically universal
among the younger generation.
In the northern Marianas, English in not so widely used as
it is in Guam. It was not used at all in the northern islands until
after World War II, and then only sparingly by the administering
authorities and in the schools. It was not until after 1961, when
the Trust Territory Headquarters moved to Saipan, that English
came to be used widely, both in the schools and the communications media.
The influence of English on the Chamorro language is very
much like the influence of Spanish. Many words have been
borrowed from English into Chamorro; but Chamorro grammar
has not taken on any of the features of English grammar. Most
of the borrowed words are names of newly introduced objects,
such as ""washing machine, Jeep, lighter, pizza"" and so on.
Occasionally one hears a complete English phrase in the middle
of a Chamorro stream of speech. One that I have heard frequently
is ""I mean . . . "" which is used, as in English, when one wishes to
try to clarify something he has just said.
English Loanblends. As was the case with Spanish, many English
words have been made to conform to Chamorro grammar and
pronunciation rules. These are cases of ""loanblends."" Some
examples of these loanblends are bumoling (from ""bowling""),
lumans (from ""lunch""), and mantataip (from ""type""). (For a
more complete discussion of these loanblends and how they are
made to conform to the Chamorro system, see Topping 1963b.)
Influence of Foreign Languages on Chamorro Spelling. Of the
various foreign language influences on the spelling of Chamorro,
that of Spanish has been the greatest. Since the Spanish priests
were the first to spell the Chamorro language, it is not surprising
that they used their own alphabet. Considering the vast differences in the two languages, the Spanish alphabet served surprisingly well and is still used today by many people who write
Chamorro.
German appears to have had some influence on the spellingINTRODUCTION9of Chamorro. This can be seen in some writings where the letter
k is used in place of Spanish c or qu, gw for gu, h for j, and j for
y, as pronounced in the English word ""yes.""
Since Japanese does not use the Roman alphabet for writing,
it had no influence on the Chamorro writing system.
The influence of English on everyday written Chamorro has
not been very great. This is probably due to the fact that most
people who can write English seldom have the need to write
anything in Chamorro. The influence of English writing did play
some part in the official Chamorro Orthography which was adopted in Saipan in January, 1971. This is discussed in Section 2.8.1
below.
DIALECTS O F C H A M O R R O
1.5As stated in 1.2 above, there are differences in the dialects of
Chamorro that are spoken in different areas. The dialect of the
southern villages of Guam—Inarajan, Merizo, Umatac—differs from the dialect spoken in Yona, Agana, or Yigo. The dialect
of Rota differs from the dialect of Saipan or Guam. Although
these dialect differences have never been formally described, a
native speaker of Chamorro has no difficulty in detecting a dialect
that is different from his own. And in most cases he can identify
the dialect being spoken.
The dialect differences are not great enough to cause any
difficulty in communication.
The major dialect differences are between Rota and all the
other islands. The Saipan dialect and the dialect of central and
northern Guam are very similar, while the dialects of southern
Guam and Rota have certain common features. The major difference between the dialects of Saipan and Guam are found in
vocabulary; Saipanese tend to use more loanwords from Japanese while Guamanians use more loanwords from English.
If a native speaker is asked to describe the distinctive features
of the Rota dialect, he usually says that the people from Rota
speak in a ""sing-song"" manner. This description is a fairly accurate one. In linguistic terms we might say that the Rota dialect is
characterized by more frequent non-terminal junctures which
cause more frequent rising and falling of pitch levels. These
junctures make the Rota dialect sound more ""rhythmical"" or
""sing-song.""","[19, 20, 21]"
"MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE175Derivational Affixes. Listed below in alphabetical order are some
of the derivational affixes of Chamorro. The names that have been
chosen for them are arbitrary. Whenever possible the author has
used traditional terminology. In some cases the prefix is given a
name; in other cases a translation seems more appropriate.
Some of the affixes are more productive than others: that is
to say, some affixes can be easily combined with new stems to
form new words. Most of the affixes listed here are still very
productive. There is no doubt that some affixes which were formerly productive have now become fossilized in a few words.
For example, there is an obvious relationship between papa
'wing' and palapa 'to flap wings', but the meaning of -la- (if there
ever was one) has been lost. We find it in a few other words such
as chalaochao (from chaochao) 'shake, rattle,' kalaskas (from
kaskas) 'rustling sound,' and palangpang (from pangpang) 'explosion.' Even in these words the meaning of the affix -la- is not
clear.
a- Reciprocal Prefix. This prefix is always attached to a verb.
It means 'to each other'. It may occur with other affixes, and it
carries primary stress.
Umatungo' i dos.
'The two know each other.'
Umapacha i dos.
'The two touched each other.'
Manapacha i famagu'on.
'The children touched each other.'acha- Similative Prefix. This prefix may be attached to different
types of words. It conveys the meaning of'similarity', 'sameness',
or 'equally'.
Achalokka' i dos.
'The two are the same height.'
Ma'achaguaiya i dos.
'The two were loved equally.'
U fanma'achaguaiya i tres.
'The three of them will be loved equally.'an- 'leftover'. This prefix is usually attached to noun-like words.
Ha kanno' i ankanno'.
'He ate the leftover food.'","[186, 187]"
"T H E N O U N PHRASE
4.1The noun phrase (NP) is probably a basic grammatical unit in all
languages. The term noun phrase is used to define a structure that
contains a noun or nounlike word as a nucleus. The nucleus may
be considered the ""center"" or the ""headword"" of the NP. The
headword may or may not have attributes or modifiers.
(The various terms such as nucleus, center, headword,
attribute, and modifier are all used by various linguists. In this
discussion of the N P we will use the terms headword for ""nucleus""
and modifier for ""attribute."")
The N P in Chamorro may consist of any of the following:NP""Emphatic Pronoun
/(«-type Pronoun
yo'-type Pronoun
Proper Noun
Common Noun + Modifiers
Other NominalsSome examples showing the above types of NP's are given here:
Emphatic Pronoun:Guahu tumungo' i lahi.
'I am the one who knows the man.'hu-type Pronoun:Hu tungo' i lahi.
'I know the man.'yo'-type Pronoun:Manungo' ycV lahi.
*I know a man.'",[215]
"164MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTUREThe questions are simply marked by a higher level of pitch at the
end of the sentence.
Tag Questions. Tag questions are used very commonly in all
languages when the speaker anticipates an answer. An example
of a tag question in English would be, ""This is a book about
Chamorro, isn't it?"" or "" H e read the book, didn't he?""
In Chamorro tag questions are formed by simply adding the
word no to the end of a statement, as in the following examples:
Ya-mu manestudia, no?
'You like to study, don't you?'
Machocho'cho' hao duru, no?
'You are working hard, aren't you?'
Para un fatto giya siha, no?
'You are going to his place, aren't you?'
Classifiers
3.5.0Many of the languages of Asia and the Pacific area have a grammatical feature generally known as classifiers. In a language with
a fully operative classifier system each concrete noun belongs to
a certain class and is marked by the use of that classifier. In a
language such as Trukese this system of classifiers is found in the
counting system and the possessives.
The Chamorro system of classifiers was probably much more
elaborate in the past than it is now. The system of counting
described by Safford (1909: 47-50) and by Costenoble (1940:
259-265) suggests that Chamorro once had a system of classifying
nouns that has been lost. Only vestiges of the classifier system are
still in use.
In modern Chamorro the classifiers are used in possessive
constructions only. The classifiers and the categories they mark
are as follows:
na'
ga'
iyo
gimen'edible things'
'non-human animals'
'inanimate objects'
'drinkable things'Of the four classifiers, the first three are commonly used. The last
one, gimen, is frequently omitted. Iyo is used metaphorically
with human objects, as in Iyo-ku hao, 'You belong to me.'
Following are some examples showing the use of the Chamorro classifiers:MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE165Guaha na'-hu guihan.

Guaha dos mannok na'-na.

'The child was playing at the beach with his crab.'
NOTE: The word ga'lagu 'dog' is a compound word made up of
the morphemes ga' 'animal classifier' and lagu 'north'. Literally
translated ga'lagu means 'animal from the north', which suggests
that it was introduced by a foreign group.
The classifier ga' is also used with verbs to mean 'one who
loves to' do something, as in the following examples. (Primary
stress usually falls on ga'-.)

In the last three sentences above the use of the classifier iyo could
have easily been avoided by phrasing the statements differently.","[175, 176, 177]"

Irregular Noun Plurals. There is a small set of nouns in Chamorro
that have irregular plural forms. All of these nouns refer to
people. The singular and plural forms of the irregular nouns are
listed below:
Singularlahi
palao'an
patgon'man'
'woman'
'child'Plurallalahi
famalao'an
famagu'on'men'
'women'
'children'A slightly larger subgroup of the irregular nouns are pluralized by the prefix man-. These nouns also refer to persons. And
some have been derived from verbs through the nominalizing
process of reduplication. The following list will show the nouns
that are pluralized by adding man-. (It should be stressed that
these nouns are pluralized by the prefix man- even when they are
not functioning as predicates. The regular morphophonemic
changes caused by man- will be observed except where another
type of affixation, e.g., reduplication has already taken place,
as in the case of the derived nouns.)

"THE SOUNDSYSTEMOFCHAMORROThe sound changes listed above show the result of what happens
when a word is borrowed from one language into another and
when the sound systems of the two languages are different from
each other. In the examples listed above, Chamorro made the
Spanish words conform to the Chamorro sound system. In some
cases, Chamorro simply did not have the sound (i.e., v, -11-, -rr-);
in other cases, Chamorro had the sound, but the distributional
limitations were different (i.e. final -1, -r and -d).
The sound changes listed above were highly regular. In addition to those, there were some irregular sound changes. They are
called irregular because the sound change has proved to be inconsistent, and therefore unpredictable. They involve the sounds
1, r, and h.
In some instances, Spanish r became Chamorro r or was
omitted entirely. For example:
SpanishChamorrofranelafranela—flanelaIn other instances, Spanish r became Chamorro 1:
fritoaflituAnd, in a few instances, Chamorro added h where there was none
in Spanish:
espiaespihaFor the most part, the sound changes that occurred when
Spanish words were borrowed into Chamorro were very regular.
Hence, when we hear a Chamorro word that is Spanish in origin,
we can usually reconstruct the original Spanish word accurately
simply by following the rules of sound changes listed above.
Following are some Chamorrocized Spanish words with the
original Spanish words from which they came. See if you can
describe the sound changes that took place in each word.

in words that occur very often. This high frequency of occurrence
may cause the sounds in the word to undergo further change. An
example of such a word in Chamorro is Yu'us from Spanish Dios
meaning 'God'.","[79, 80, 81]"
"MORPHEME
3.1The morpheme is a very important concept in linguistic analysis.
Although it is not a difficult concept, it is sometimes confused
with the word or syllable. Sometimes a morpheme is equivalent
to a word, but at other times it isn't. Also, a morpheme is sometimes a single syllable; but at other times a morpheme may be
polysyllabic—it may have several syllables.
A morpheme is defined by C. F. Hockett as ""the smallest
individually meaningful element in the utterances of a language.""
(Hockett 1958: 123) Unlike the phoneme, a morpheme conveys
70MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE71meaning, and it cannot be analyzed into any smaller unit that also
has meaning.
The following illustrations from English may help clarify
this concept. Consider the following pair:
daughter
hotter
We will assume that both of these items are words because they
are both usually written as separate words. (No attempt will be
made to give a more formal definition of the word at this point.)
Notice that both of these words contain two syllables. The second
syllable of each word sounds the same. But the question is does
the -er of daughter mean the same as the -er of hotter ? The answer,
of course, is ""no.""
Another question to ask is whether the -er of either word
has any meaning by itself and if it recurs with other words with
the same meaning? Another way of phrasing the question is this:
can the -er of either word be detached from the word and reattached to another word to give it some additional meaning?
And, if we remove the -er from the word, is the remaining portion
a meaningful segment? Let's apply these tests to the two words
in question.
First, remove the -er from both words:
daught
hot(er)
(er)We recognize that hot is a word that can stand by itself with the
same meaning or can enter into combinations with other words,
as in ""hot water,"" ""hot days,"" and ""very hot."" On the other hand,
*daught cannot stand by itself with the meaning ""female offspring.""
At the same time, the -er of hotter can be attached to other
words and carry the same meaning that it does in the word hotter.
For example, we have such words as younger meaning ""more
young,"" bigger meaning ""more big,"" and so on. The -er of hotter
can be readily identified as a segment of the English language that
carries meaning. The -er of daughter is obviously a very different
segment for two reasons: (1) If we detach it from the word we are
left with the meaningless segment * daught; (2) We cannot attach
it to other words for the purpose of giving them a similar meaning.
(It might be argued that the -er of daughter is also found on
the words sister, mother, brother, and father, and that its function
is to identify membership in the immediate family. However,MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTUREsince its use is not productive for forming new words, it will be
considered as an inseparable part of each of the above words.)
What can now be said about the two words hotter and daughter? In the first place, they are both words. Secondly, they both
have two syllables. But there the similarity stops. The word
hotter can be divided into two morphemes, hot and -er. The word
daughter cannot be further analyzed into smaller components;
hence, the word daughter is a single morpheme.
Some further examples of English words that contain two
morphemes are truly (true and -ly), likeness (like and -ness),
electricity (electric and -ity), and boys (boy and -s).
Some further examples of words of more than one syllable
but which are single morphemes are expect, cadaver, language,
and communicate. These words cannot be broken down into
smaller meaningful units. They are minimum semantic units
and are therefore morphemes. Again, one could say that we can
detach the ex- from expect and use it with words like excel. But,
it is doubtful that the ex- of expect and excel have any common
meaning. And it is certain that *pect and *cel don't mean anything by themselves. Hence, the words expect and excel cannot
be reduced any further.
There are parallel examples in Chamorro which will help to
establish the concept of the morpheme. The following pair of
words will serve to illustrate:
binaya'
binenu'filled, satiated'
'poison'The first word binaya' contains two morphemes. One of these is
baya' meaning 'satiate' or 'fill'; the other is the morpheme -in-.
We know that -in- is a morpheme because it changes the meaning
of the word baya' in practically the same way that it changes the
meaning in other pairs of words, such as maolek-minaolek, bababinaba, and tanom-tinanom.
On the other hand, we cannot break down the second word
binenu 'poison' into two morphemes to get *benu plus -in-. There
is no Chamorro word *benu. Hence, binenu is a single word and a
single morpheme that cannot be broken down into smaller
meaningful units.
Another example from Chamorro can be found in the pair of
expressions yamu 'you like' and ñamu 'mosquito'. In the first
expression we know that we have two morphemes. The morphemeMORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE73-mu can recur in combination with other morphemes with the
same meaning, e.g., ilekmu 'you said', malago'mu 'you want'.
Also, the morpheme ya- can recur with other morphemes with the
same meaning, e.g., yahu 'I like', yaita 'he likes'.
The -mu of narnu cannot be separated. If we did try to break
the word hamu into two morphemes, then we would have a
meaningless *iia- and a meaningless *-mu, because the -mu of hamu
has no relationship in meaning to the -mu of yamu.
(Remember that the -mu of ya-mu and ilek-mu is set off by
a hyphen in the writing system.)
The conclusion then is that yamu consists of two morphemes
—ya- and -mu—while iiamu is a single morpheme.
Some additional Chamorro words that are polysyllabic but
consist of a single morpheme are dankolo 'big', dikike' 'small',
and lamasa 'table'. (Note that lamasa was originally two morphemes in Spanish—la mesa—but in Chamorro usage it is a
single morpheme.)
Some Chamorro words that consist of two or more morphemes are gumupu 'fly' (from gupu plus -um-), guma'yu'os
'church' (from guma' and yu'os), and fina'denne' 'hot sauce'
(from donne', fa'-, and -in-).
TYPES OF MORPHEMES AND WORDS
3.2
Under the general heading of morpheme come several types.
Since it will be necessary to make frequent references to them
during the discussion of the grammar, the various types of morphemes found in Chamorro will be presented here.
Free morphemes are morphemes which can stand alone without any other morphemes attached to them. They are always
words, and they cannot be reduced to any smaller forms. Some
examples of free morphemes are / 'the', dankolo 'big', hatsa 'to
lift', li'e' 'to see', and pachot 'mouth'.
Bound morphemes can never stand alone, but must always be
attached to another morpheme to form a word. Some examples
of bound morphemes are e- as in epanglao 'look for crabs', -umas in sumasaga 'be staying', and -naihon as in saganhaihon 'stay
for a while'. Bound morphemes cannot be considered as words,
but they serve to form complex words. (See below for discussion
of complex words.)
With these two categories of morphemes we can form three
different types of words. The first type of word will be called74MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTUREsimple words. They are equal to the free morphemes described
above. They may also be considered roots or root words.
The second type of word will be called compound words
which are composed of two (possibly more) free morphemes.
Some examples of compound words are halomtano' 'forest',
guma'yu'os 'church', and tronkonhayu 'tree'. It is often difficult to
determine whether the Chamorro compound words should be
treated as single words or as phrases consisting of two words.
(This is often a problem in English as well.) For example, are terms
such as batkon aire 'airplane' a compound word or a noun
phrase? Or what about botsan alunan 'pillow case'? Is halomtano'
a compound word or a series of two words? The question can
best be resolved by the intuitive feelings of the native speaker.
The third type of word is the complex word, and except for
simple words, it is probably the most common type of word
found in Chamorro. The complex word consists of either a free
morpheme plus one or more bound morphemes, or, on rare occasions, two bound morphemes. Some examples of complex
words consisting of free and bound morphemes are apasi 'to
pay' (from apas plus -i), fa'maolek 'fix' (from fa'- plus maolek),
and hinasso 'thought' (from hasso plus -in-). An example of a
complex word consisting of two bound morphemes is na'i 'to
give' (from na'- plus -/').
In many cases the bound morpheme of complex words has
become ""fossilized"" so that native speakers tend to think of the
word as an indivisible unit. A word such as ekungok 'to listen'
probably comes from the bound morpheme e-plus hungok 'to
hear'; the word tattiyi 'follow' probably comes from the free
morpheme tatte 'follow' plus the bound morpheme -yi.
Allomorphs
3.2.1In Section 2.1.2, which forms part of the discussion of the sound
system of Chamorro, the term allophone was explained as ""phonetic variants"" of a single phoneme. In a manner quite parallel to
the phoneme-allophone relationship, we also find a morphemeallomorph relationship. An allomorph is a variant of a morpheme
occurring in a specific environment. In other words, the same
morpheme may be pronounced differently depending on the
immediate environment.
It is important not to confuse allomorphs with the different
pronunciations that result from rapid speech or from contrac-MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE75tions. In English, for example, didn't is a contracted form of
did not, but it is not an allomorph. In Chamorro, pon is frequently
used as a contracted form of para un (as in Para un cho'gue),
but it is not an allomorph.
Allomorphs are different forms of a single morpheme and
the differences in form are determined by their immediate environment. Some examples from English and Chamorro will
help to illustrate this concept.
In English, the morpheme that signifies past tense is written
-ed. The pronunciation of this morpheme will vary, depending on
the pronunciation of the word to which it is attached. The past
tense of the verb walk is walked, pronounced /wokt/. The final
-ed in this case is pronounced /t/. The past tense of the verb move
is moved, pronounced /muvd/. The final -ed in this case is pronounced /d/. And the past tense of the verb treat is treated,
pronounced /tritad/. The final -ed in this case is pronounced /ad/.
The above examples illustrate that there are at least three
allomorphs of the past tense verb ending in English. (There are
actually more, but these are the most common ones.) They are
/t/, /d/, and /ad/. The environments for these three allomorphs
can be easily stated:
1. If the stem ends with /t/ or /d/, the allomorph /ad/ will occur.
2. If the stem ends with any voiceless consonant except /t/, the
allomorph /t/ will occur.
3. The allomorph /d/ occurs elsewhere.
In Chamorro there is a morpheme -i that can be attached to
many words, and it usually means 'to someone' or 'for someone'.
It is found, for example, in the word sangani 'tell to', which comes
from sangan plus -i. This morpheme also has three allomorphs—
-/, -yi, and -gui—which are determined by the immediate environment.
In addition to words like sangani, which contains the morphemes sangan plus -/, there are the following: hatsayi 'lift for',
which comes from hatsa plus -yi, and hanagui 'go for', which
comes from hanao plus -gui. Obviously, the morphemes -i, -yi,
and -gui have the same meaning (or very nearly the same). We can
say that they are different forms of the same morpheme; or, to
put it in linguistic terms, they are allomorphs of a single morpheme. The differences in pronunciation are determined by the
immediate environment. The environments for these three allomorphs can be easily stated:76MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE1. If the stem ends with a consonant, the allomorph -i will occur.
2. If the stem ends with the diphthong -ao, the allomorph -gui
will occur.
3. The allomorph -yi occurs elsewhere.
NOTE: The morpheme hanao also has two allomorphs, as can
be seen in the above example. When the morpheme -gui is
added, then the allomorph hana occurs instead of hanao. Otherwise we would get *hanaogui which is not an acceptable form.
There are different possible linguistic interpretations of the
changes that occur when we go from hanao to hanagui. The
interpretation given here is the simplest one and will suffice to
explain the data.
Notes to Linguists: Diphthongs. The allomorphic alternation
observed here in hanao-hanagui lends further evidence for considering /aw/ and /gw/ as allophones. Also, there is parallel
alternation between /ay/ and /z/, as can be seen in the following
examples:
taitai /taytay/'read'/taytazi/'read for'If we posit that [gw] and [z] are in complementary distribution
with [aw] and [ay] respectively, then this would simplify the rules
for the alternation of the allomorphs -i, -yi, and -gui. It would
also allow for a more economical statement of the phonemic
inventory.
W O R D CLASSES I N C H A M O R R O : PARTS O F SPEECH
3.3In addition to the types of morpheme classification presented
in the preceding section, it will be helpful to examine the word
classes—parts of speech—in Chamorro. We will begin at the
most general level of classification of words and work down to
the more specific classes and types of words.
In classifying parts of speech in Chamorro it is tempting to
follow the traditional lines of nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs,
and so forth. Indeed, at some points in the grammar we will do so.
It seems reasonable to consider words like lahi 'man', langet 'sky',
and guma' 'house' as nouns. Words like dankolo 'big', dikike'
'small', and mannge' 'delicious' certainly appear to be adjectives.
And one could not argue that words like malagu 'run', hatsa 'lift',
and chumocho 'eat' are anything but verbs.
This system of classification is based largely on traditional
methods for classifying parts of speech in English. Furthermore,MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE77the system is based on the meaning of the words. For our present
purposes, this system of classification of words does not work
very well.
The classification of words in Chamorro requires that we use
a system that is suitable for Chamorro. In the Chamorro language we often find the same word functioning as a noun, a verb,
and an adjective according to the traditional definitions of those
grammatical terms. Consider, for example, the word dankolo
'big' in the following sentences:
Dankolo si Juan.
'Juan is big.'
Hu li'e' i dankolo.
'I saw the big one.'
Hu li'e' i dankolo na taotao.
'I saw the big person.'
In the first sentence, dankolo functions as the predicate of the
sentence where we would normally expect to find a verb. In the
second sentence, dankolo appears to be a direct object, where we
would normally expect to find a noun. In the third sentence,
dankolo is clearly a modifier of the word taotao. We would
ordinarily call any word that functions in this manner an adjective.
One can see from the above examples that it could be very
confusing to try to classify Chamorro parts of speech on the basis
of meaning or function alone. It will be necessary, then, to use
different methods for classifying words in Chamorro.
Word classification in Chamorro can best be determined on
the basis of the grammatical properties of the word, not on the
basis of its meaning or its function as a subject, predicate, modifier or whatever. That is to say, words are said to belong to the
same class if they can substitute for each other in a grammatical
frame, or if they ""behave"" in the same way. One might also say
that words belong to the same class if they can take the same kind
of affixation.
Words in Chamorro can be divided into two basic classes,
the Major Word Class and the Minor Word Class, each of which
has several subclasses.
Major Word Class
3.3.1The class of words in Chamorro labeled major word class consists
of words that are traditionally designated by such terms as noun,MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTUREverb, adjective, and adverb. Since these terms are not entirely
appropriate for classifying C h a m o r r o words, we will use the
terms ""Class I , "" ""Class I I , "" and ""Class I I I "" for purposes of basic
classification. (This system is also used in the Chamorro-English
Dictionary for purposes of classification.)
The major word class consists of open sets of words. That is
to say, new words are constantly being added to and lost f r o m the
class of m a j o r words. (The minor word class consists of dosed
sets: words are seldom added to or lost from this class.) One might
say that the major class of words forms the more fluid part of the
vocabulary of any language. When we invent new words, they
are nearly always members of the major class.
Class I Words. Words in C h a m o r r o are said to belong to Class I
provided the following two conditions can be met: (1) They must
be able to take the passive voice prefix ma-; (2) They must be
able to form the predicate of a goal focus construction. (More
will be said about passive voice and goal focus later.)
Examples of these two constructions follow. The words
hatsa 'to lift' and li'e' 'to see' will be used.
Passive Voice:Mahatsa i lamasa.
'The table was lifted.'
Mali'e' i palao'an.
'The woman was seen.'","[82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]"
"T h e pronoun in C h a m o r r o is generally similar to the p r o n o u n of
other languages. N o special definition for this category is required.
There are f o u r sets of p r o n o u n s in C h a m o r r o , each of which has
its own special function. These f o u r types of p r o n o u n s are discused
separately below and are presented together at the end of the discussion in the f o r m of a chart.
T h e first set of p r o n o u n s are called hu-type pronouns. T h e
n a m e of this set comes f r o m the first person singular f o r m , which is
hu. T h e complete set of /iw-type p r o n o u n s is as follows:

ma'we inclusive'
'we exclusive'
'you—2 or more
'they'The /zw-type p r o n o u n s function as subject markers and always
precede the verb. In transitive statements with Class I words,
these p r o n o u n subject markers must occur, even when a n o u n
subject also occurs. Notice in the following examples that the
first sentence has a subject n o u n plus the subject marking p r o n o u n .
T h e second example contains a pronominal subject only:
Si Juan ha li'e' i palao'an.
'Juan saw the woman.'
Ha li'e' i palao'an.
'He saw the woman.'
NOTE: The word order of the sentence in the first example
could also be Ha li'e' si Juan i palao'an with no change in
meaning. When this word order is used, the noun immediately
following the verb is the subject noun.
T h e p r o n o u n s ta and in are both glossed as "" w e , "" with the
additional specification ""inclusive"" or ""exclusive."" All of the
C h a m o r r o p r o n o u n s show this same distinction between the two
p r o n o u n s meaning "" w e . "" T h e term inclusive means simply that
the speaker is including the person he is talking t o ; exclusive
means ""we, but not y o u , "" or "" w e "" excluding the person spoken
to.
Both inclusive and exclusive forms of the p r o n o u n may beMORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE107dual (referring to ""we two"") or plural (referring to three or
more). Plurality as opposed to duality is indicated by the form
of the verb used with the pronoun. This will be discussed later.
The second set of pronouns are called yo'-type pronouns. The
name of this set comes from the first person singular form which
is yo'. (The pronoun yo' was in all probability borrowed from
Spanish. It is the only ""non-native"" pronoun in the language.)
The complete set of the yo '-type pronouns is as follows:SingularPlural1st

should be considered subject p r o n o u n s u n d e r t h e following
conditions:
1. When used with any Class II word:
Gumupu yo'.
'I flew.'
Maolek yo'.
'I am good.'
Lahi yo'.
'I am a man.'
2. when used with a Class I (transitive) word with an indefinite
object:
Manhatsa yo' lamasa.
'I lifted a table.'
Manli'e' yo' lahi.
'I saw a man.'
Manaitai yo' lepblo.
'I read a book.'
T h e _yo'-type p r o n o u n s should be considered object p r o n o u n s
when they occur with a Class I (transitive) word as a specific
object. See the following e x a m p l e s :MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTURESi Juan ha li'e' yo'.
'Juan saw me.'
Si Maria ha hatsa gue'.
'Maria lifted him.'
I lahi ha sangani ham.
'The man told us.'
Like the other pronouns, the plural pronouns of the yo'-type
can be either dual or plural depending on the form of the verb.
The possessive pronouns usually have the function that the
name suggests; that is, they usually indicate possession of the
noun to which they are attached. The possessive pronouns are
listed here:

-mami

'your'
'his, hers'
'our inclusive'
'our exclusive'
'your—2 or more'
'their—2 or more'All of the possessive pronouns are written here with hyphens
preceding them. This is a writing device to show that the possessive pronouns are bound morphemes—they must always be
attached to the preceding word.
In section 2.6.2. on Phrase Stress, it was pointed out that the
favored stress pattern in Chamorro was penultimate—on the
next to final syllable. The addition of the possessive pronoun to a
Chamorro word nearly always causes a shift in the primary
stress to the penultimate syllable. For this reason, the possessive
pronouns are sometimes referred to as enclitics, which are words
that are pronounced as forming a phonetic unit with the stressed
word preceding it.
Notice how the primary stress shifts to the penultimate
syllable in the following examples:
kareta
kareta
kareta
kareta'car'
'car'
'car'
'car'kareta-hu
kareta-ta
karetan-mami
karetan-niha'my car'
'our car'
'our car'
'their car'It will also be noticed that all of the disyllabic possessive
pronouns (those with two syllables) require the excrescent consonant n before they are joined to a vowel-final stem. (Cf. 2.7.2.)MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTURE109The possessive pronouns do not always show possession.
With certain verbs and in certain grammatical constructions they
appear to function more like subject pronouns. For example,
the words of Class IIIc (cf. 3.3.2) must always take the possessive
pronoun as the subject:
Ilek-hu ""never.""
'I said ""never"".'
Ga'o-mu este.
'You prefer this.'
Ya-hu humanao.
'I want to go.'
The possessive pronouns also occur as subject pronouns in
certain question constructions which use the question words hafa
'what' and hayi 'who'. Notice the following examples:
Hafa malago'-mu?
'What do you want?'
Hafa lini'e'-na?
'What did he see?'
Hayi malago'-mu?
'Whom do you want?'
Hayi lini'e'-na?
'Whom did he see?'
It might be possible to translate the above sentences as 'What
is your want?' and 'What was his thing-seen?' and so forth.
This would preserve the possessive nature of the pronoun, but it
would give us very clumsy translations. It seems preferable to
say that the possessive pronouns also function as subject pronouns under certain conditions.
The possessive pronouns have another special function when
they occur with location words. In this situation they seem to
function as a kind of object of the location word, similar to an
object of a preposition in English. The examples below will
illustrate this special function:
hulo'
mo'na
tatte
fi'on
agapa'
akague'above'
'in front'
'behind'
'near'
'right side'
'left side'i hilo'-mami

i fi'on-mu
i agapa'-na
i akague-na'above us'
'in front of them'
'behind me'
'near you'
'to the right of him'
'to the left of him'MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTUREThere is another important morphophonemic change in the
first person singular possessive pronoun. We have given the base
form of this pronoun as -hu. It also occurs as -su, -tu, and -ku
under the following conditions:
1. If the stem has a final s, the form of the pronoun is -su:
lassas 'skin;' lassas-su 'my skin.'
2. If the stem has a final t, the form of the pronoun is -tu: pachot
'mouth;' pachot-tu 'my mouth.'
3. If the stem has a medial consonant cluster, then the form of
the pronoun is -ku: lepblo 'book;' lepbld-ku 'my book'.
Under all other conditions, the form of the pronoun is -hu.
For purposes of writing, only -hu and -ku will be written.
The last set of pronouns to be discussed are the emphatic
pronouns. They usually function as subject pronouns and are used
in situations where the subject is emphasized. The full set of
emphatic pronouns is given here:

Guahu Iumi'e' i palao'an.
'I am the one who saw the woman.'
Guiya humatsa i Iamasa.
'He is the one who lifted the table.'
NOTE: When the emphatic pronouns are used as subject pronouns, the verb must take a special affix. In the above examples
the affix is -um-. This is part of the focus system of Chamorro
which will be discussed in section 4.10 below.
The emphatic pronouns may also be found in other types of
contructions where they should not be described as subject
pronouns. For example, in answer to the question Hayi chumo'gue? ' W h o did it?', one could say Guiya 'Him.'
The emphatic pronouns are also found in such expressions
as guatu giya guiya 'towards him'. In addition, the emphatic
pronouns are used very commonly to mean 'at someone's house'MORPHOLOGY:WORDSANDTHEIR111STRUCTUREas in giya hami 'at o u r house' or giya hamyo ' a t y o u r place'. T h e y
m a y also occur as emphasized object p r o n o u n s in transitive

3.4.2In grammar books written for English one can find the terms
""demonstrative pronoun"" and ""demonstrative adjective"" used to
refer to the words 'this, that, these, etc.' For Chamorro we can
use the same term demonstrative to refer to the group of words
that point out something specific.
Chamorro has a three-way demonstrative system. The most
commonly used words that form this system are:
este 'this, close to speaker'
enao 'that, close to listener'
ayu 'that, away from speaker and listener'
Este 'this' was borrowed from Spanish, and has almost
completely replaced the original Chamorro demonstrative which,
according to Safford (41) was ayen ""if placed before the predicate,"" and yini or ini ""if placed after the predicate of a sentence.""
Safford reported in 1903 that the Spanish loanword este was
""fast taking the place of ayen and ini."" While I have never heard
these older Chamorro forms used in daily conversation, I have
recorded ini in some folk tales as they were told by present-day
Chamorro speakers. It is probably safe to conclude that the Spanish demonstrative este is now used far more frequently than ini
or yini and that ayen is not used at all.
(Incidentally, ini occurs in modern Malay for 'this', and
it parallels the modern Chamorro locative word guini in the same
way that the demonstrative enao is related to the locative word
guenao.)
The word enao has an alternate form yenao which is sometimes heard, especially in the speech of older persons or in folk
tales. Although the word yenao does not occur in any of the texts
on which this grammar is based, its occurrence in the language
has been attested by several informants.
The word ayu is frequently heard as eyu. While both ayu
and eyu are currently in use, it is possible that eyu will ultimately
replace ayu. If this happens, then all three of the demonstratives
will share the common feature of beginning with the same sound
e. This apparent change in the language that is taking place can
be described as a sort of leveling, a process by which the three
demonstratives will share a common feature.
There is still another word yuhi that shares some of the same
features as ayu and eyu. In some situations it may be used in placeMORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTURE113of ayu or eyu as a demonstrative. In other cases, it functions like
a ""relative pronoun."" When yuhi is used as a demonstrative, it is
understood that a prior reference to something has already been
made or is understood, or that the feature of location is also
included, as in 'that there'. Notice the following examples:
a. Hu taitai ayu na lepblo.
'I read that book.'
b. Hu taitai yuhi na lepblo.
'I read that there book.'
c. Ayu na lepblo hu taitai.
'That book I read.'
But not:
d. *Yuhi na lepblo hu taitai.
Sentences a and b are not entirely synonymous. In sentence b
the demonstrative yuhi suggests that the reference to ""that book""
is more specific, visible, or that its existence is known to both the
speaker and listener. A closer translation of yuhi in sentence b
might be 'that there'. Sentence d is considered ungrammatical.
In other situations ayu, eyu, and yuhi appear to be interchangeable, as the following examples will show:
Paraayu siha na mane'lu-hu i taotao i distritu kuatro.
eyu
yuhi
'For those my brothers the people of the fourth district.'
The status of yuhi as a demonstrative is not entirely clear.
The following sample sentence shows that all of the demonstratives except yuhi are acceptable:
Este ha' manmacho'guen-mimiyu pa'go.
Ini
'This is how you are being treated now.'
Enaoha' manmacho'guen-mimiyu pa'go.
Yenao
'That is how you are being treated now.'
Ayu ha' manmacho'guen-mimiyu pa'go.
Eyu
'That is how you are being treated now.'
But not:
*Yuhi ha' manmacho'guen-mimiyu pa'go.","[118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"Articles
3.4.6There is a set of ""little"" words in Chamorro that will be called
articles. Even though they are little (or small) words, they form a
very important part of the grammar of Chamorro. In some cases
they seem similar to the articles in English, but in many cases the
use of the Chamorro articles is unique to Chamorro, and have no
parallel to the use of articles in English or Spanish.
There are some Spanish articles used in Modern Chamorro,
but their use is very limited. We will first look at the Chamorro
articles and then take a brief look at the few Spanish loan articles.
The Chamorro articles can be subclassed into two types.
There are common articles and proper articles. The proper articles
are used with proper names of people or places; the common
articles are used elsewhere. It should be remembered that the
Chamorro articles can not always be translated into English.
The proper articles in Chamorro are si, as, and iya. Articles
si and as are used with names of people; iya is used with names of
places. Notice the use of the articles in the following examples:
Si
Si Juan.
Si Nana.
Si Maga'lahi.
Si Yu'us.
Mangge si Rita?
Si Ben yo'.
Si Juan ha chiku
si Maria.",[142]
"MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTUREThe above examples show the Spanish preposition pot used in
Chamorro constructions with C h a m o r r o words. Several complete
expressions using pot were borrowed from Spanish. Notice the
following Chamorrocized examples of Spanish expressions:
Chule' magi pot fabot. (from Sp. por favor)
'Bring it here please.'
Pot fin.
'Finally.'
Pot i hemplo.
'For example.'
Pot uttimu.
'Ultimately.'
Unu pot unu.
'One by one.'
Pot also functions as a type of conjunction. This will be discussed
later in the section on conjunctions.
The preposition kontra has retained its original Spanish
meaning 'against'. Like many C h a m o r r o prepositions, it can also
be used as a verb, as in the expression Hu kontra i lahi 'I challenged
the man.' Examples of kontra as a preposition are:
Umapo' yo' kontra i liga.
'I leaned against the wall.'
Kontra i lai bumulachu.
'Being drunk is against the law.'
Baba bida-na kontra i taotao.
'His work is bad against the people.'
The Spanish prepositions that cannot be used freely in combination with Chamorro words will be called G r o u p II prepositions. The most common prepositions of this group are as follows:
di
kon(Sp. de)
(Sp. con)The preposition di is used very often in Chamorro speech. In
the majority of cases it is used in fixed idiomatic expressions that
are of Spanish origin. Most of these expressions function more
like conjunctions and subordinators, and will be discussed under
those headings. For some examples of di as a preposition, or 'preposition like', see the following:MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTURE129Basta di mama'baba.
'Stop fooling around.'
Sigi hao di mama'baba fan ta'lo.
'You are continuing to fool around again.'
Humanao gue' en lugat di guahu.
'He went instead of me.'
The preposition kon is used very often in C h a m o r r o speech.
Like di, it is often used like a conjunction or subordinator. Most
of the time it is used in fixed idiomatic expressions which were
borrowed from Spanish. In such cases the meaning is often not
the same in Chamorro as in Spanish, as the following examples
will show:
Sangani yo' kon tiempo.
'Tell me ahead of time.'
Kon petmisu.
'With permission.'
Na'i yo' ni i papet-mu kon todu i salape'-mu.
'Give me your paper together with your money.'
Humanao si Jose kon todu si Juan.
'Jose left and so did Juan.'
Humanao yo' yan i lalahi kon todu si Juan.
'I went with the boys, including Juan.'
Kon is occasionally used in combination with C h a m o r r o words to
form expressions that should probably be considered idiomatic.
An example of this type of combination is:
Kon sigi gi hinanao-mu.
'Keep on going.'
The Spanish prepositions that were adopted by the Chamorro
speakers raise interesting linguistic questions which can not be
answered. The most important question is: Why were some Spanish prepositions borrowed while others were not? The pre-Spanish
C h a m o r r o language had ways of expressing all of the concepts that
are expressed by Spanish prepositions in the above examples. Even
in modern Chamorro it is possible, but not easy, to avoid using all
of the Spanish prepositions.
It is also interesting to note the changes in meaning that the
prepositions have undergone through borrowing. In several cases
(e.g., kon todu) the primary Spanish meaning o f ' h o w e v e r ' has been
completely lost.","[139, 140, 141]"

"MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTUREAnother peculiar aspect of ma- is that it appears to have
become fossilized in a fairly large number of words in Chamorro.
That is to say it has become an inseparable part of the word.
There are quite a few words of three syllables, the first of which
is ma-. It is tempting to try to separate ma- from the rest of the
word, the result of which would be a root word of two syllables
(e.g., ta'chong from mata'chong). In the majority of cases, if we
remove ma-, the remaining two syllables have no meaning. Some
words of this type are:
malagu
malago'
maleffa'run'
'want'
'forget'malate'
ma'udai
magahet'intelligent'
'ride'
'truly'In the above words no further morphemic analysis can be made.
We can only suspect that the initial syllable of these words was a
prefix that became fossilized and is now inseparable from the
original root. The above words now stand as roots.
Class III Words. There is a small group of words that we will
arbitrarily put into Class III. It is reasonable to argue that these
Class III words are really minor words because they form a closed
set. They are included here among the major class only because
they all have the characteristics of verbs except that they do not
take the full set of verb affixation. They are also different from
other verbs in that some of them must occur with a particular
type of subject pronoun.
These Class III words can be subclassed into categories a,
b, c, etc. They are listed below with examples.
Class Ilia words, with; rough translations and examples, are
gaige

'I am at school.'taya'
'none'Taya' salape'-hu.
'1 have no money.'guaha
'exist, have'Guaha salape'-hu.
'I have money.'tai
'none'Tai salape' yo'.
'I have no money.'gai
'exist, have.'","[91, 92]"
"In the case of transitive verbs of Type 3, the forms given
above are the only existing forms and they are therefore used even
when the object appears to be definite, e.g.,
Malago' yo' ayu na lepblo.
'I want that book.'
Manotsot yo' ni bida-hu.
'I repent what I did.'
Irregular Verbs. The irregular verbs of Chamorro were introduced
in the discussion of Class III words above. All of the irregular
verbs belong to Class III. They are called irregular verbs because
they do not conform to the patterns of affixation that the other
verbs follow. Safford (1909:97 ff.) lists most of them as ""defective
verbs."" In fact, even within Class III we find several different types
of verbs when classified in terms of their grammatical features.
The verbs that fall in this class of irregular verbs are listed

Gaige is probably the most common of the irregular verbs
in Chamorro. It is usually translated as 'there is' or 'there exists'
when the subject is specific:
Gaige yo' gi eskuela.
'I am at school.'
Gaige si Paul gi lancho.
'Paul is at the ranch.'
The verb can take the pluralizing prefix man-:

"Nouns
3.3.3Among the Class II words there is a subclass that should be
considered primarily as nouns. They are considered nouns for the
following reasons: (1) In their base form they normally occupy
a position in the sentence that can be designated ""subject of
sentence"" or ""object of sentence""; (2) They generally correspond
in meaning to nouns in other languages such as English, where
they designate or name a person, living being, object, thing, etc.
It must be remembered that other parts of speech—verbs,
modifiers, location words, and even prepositions—may also
function as subjects or objects of sentences. They can be converted
to nouns, by a process called nominalization, by adding certain
affixes. This process of nominalization will be discussed in a later
section. (Cf. section 4.3.)
At the present time we are concerned only with words which
in their base form (no affixes) can be considered nouns. SomeMORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTUREexamples of words that should be subclassed (under Class II) as
nouns are the following:
lamasa
guma'
hanom
odda'
ga'lagu
mannok
lahi
patgon
ha'ani
sakkan'table'
'house*
'water'
'soil'
'dog'
'chicken'
'man'
'child'
'day'
'year'Pedro
Maria
Saipan
GuamHow d o we know that all of the above words are nouns? We
mentioned two methods for determining if words are nouns or
not. One of the methods—probably the weaker one—is to check
for the meaning of the word. For example, if the word 'man*
in English is a noun, then the C h a m o r r o word lahi is probably
also a noun. By extension, the word meaning ' m a n ' is probably
a noun in all languages. The same test for meaning could be
applied to all of the words in the above list.
The other method is to determine whether the word in
question can substitute for another noun in a given phrase or
sentence. For example, in the sentence
Maolek i lahi.
'The man is good.'
the noun lahi functions as the subject of the sentence. Can the
other words in the list substitute for lahi in this same sentence?
Look at the following series of substitutions:
Maolek i lamasa.
Maolek i gima'.
Maolek i hanom.
Maolek i edda'.
Maolek i ga'lagu.
Maolek i mannok
Maolek i lahi.
Maolek i patgon.
Maolek i ha'ani.
Maolek i sakkan
Maolek si Pedro.
Maolek si Maria.
Maolek iya Saipan.
Maolek iya Guam.","[109, 110]"
"Prefix: Mihaga' i litratu. (mi- plus haga')
'The picture was bloody.'
Mipilu i lahi. (mi- plus pulu)
'The man is hairy.'
NOTE: Both mihaga' and mipilu have alternate forms which
are mehga' and mepplo respectively. The formation of these
shorter words is very much like the formation of gekpo from
gigipu (described above). In the case of mehga' from mihaga',
the second vowel was lost, thereby producing mihga'. Since the
first syllable became closed, the first vowel was lowered from
j_to e. The result was then mehga'. Can you describe the process
whereby mipilu became mepplo1.
Modifier to Verb. Modifiers can be converted to words that function
like verbs by the addition of the infix -um-. For example:
Infix:Dumankolo i palao'an.
'The woman became big.'
Dumikike' i guihan.
'The fish became small.'
Uma'paka' i bihu.
'The old man became white.'",[116]
"Verbs
3.3.2It was suggested above that the traditional method of classifying
the parts of speech (verb, noun, adjective, etc.) does not fit the
Chamorro language. However, the traditional terms can be used
where their use will serve to make the discussion of the grammar
more understandable. In our discussion, since we will be referring
to the verb, which lies at the very heart of C h a m o r r o grammar, it
will be necessary to explain some of the features of the Chamorro
verb.
It must be remembered that the class of words that we are
now calling "" v e r b s "" includes words from all three of the classes
of major words described above. The different classifications
serve different purposes, and they are both equally valid. It is
hoped that this dual system of classification will not cause confusion.
Chamorro verbs can be subclassified into three major categories: intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and irregular verbs.
These will be discussed separately below.
Intransitive Verbs. According to traditional definitions, an intransitive verb is one that does not require, and often cannot take,
a direct object. In addition to this definition, we can make some
further specifications for C h a m o r r o intransitive verbs.
When they form the predicate of a non-future statement,MORPHOLOGY:WORDSANDTHEIR83STRUCTUREintransitive verbs usually take either the infix -um- or the prefix
ma-, and they are followed by the subject noun or pronoun. If the
subject is a pronoun, then it must be of the_yo'-type. (Cf. section
3.4.1 on pronouns.) Some examples of intransitive verbs with
noun and pronoun subjects are given here.

"212SYNTAX
When the modifier immediately follows a verb that ends with a
vowel, an n is added to the verb. This n serves no special grammatical function, but it must be added to the verb. This n (which
can be called an excrescent consonant) serves the same purpose as
the final n in plural possessive constructions (see 4.4 below) and
in the modification constructions where the headword comes
before the modifier.
Some additional examples of this final n are given here in the
following pairs of sentences:
Ha hatsa i lamasa chaddek.
'He lifted the table quickly.'
Ha hatsan chaddek i lamasa.
'He quickly lifted the table' or 'His lifting the table was quick.'
Ha pacha i feggon gi kubatde-na.
'He touched the stove timorously.'
Ha pachan kubatde i feggon.
'He touched the stove timorously' or 'His touching the stove
was timorous.'
The alternate translations for the sentences in which the
modifier immediately follows the verb suggest that there is a slight
difference in meaning, a difference which is not easy to explain.
Modification of Sentences. Sometimes it is difficult to say whether
a modifier modifies a single word in a sentence or the entire
sentence. In the case of nouns it is pretty easy to see how a particular modifier relates directly to a specific noun, as in the following examples:
ModifierHeadwordi bunita na
i dankolo na
i mannge' napalao'an
ga'lagu
nenkanno'Headword'the pretty woman'
'the big dog'
'the delicious food'Modifieri tendan Filipino
i sapatos Japanese
i tronkon niyok'the Filipino store'
'the Japanese shoes'
'the coconut tree'However, when the headword is not a noun, the relationship
of the modifier to the rest of the sentence is sometimes not easy
to determine.
In the sentence Malagu gue' chaddek ' H e ran fast' we might
say that the modifier chaddek modifies the sentence Malagu gue'.","[223, 224]"
"T H E C H A M O R R O L A N G U A G E : ITS ORIGINS, RELATIVES, A N D
TENACITY
1.2The origins of the Chamorro language are very nearly as obscure
as the origins of the people. Since there are no written recordsINTRODUCTION3before the work of Father Sanvitores in 1668, we have no way to
ascertain what the language was like when the first people came to
the Marianas. Even the records left by Father Sanvitores, which
constitute one of the earliest grammars of any Pacific language,
are too sketchy to give a very clear picture of what the language
was like in his day. Hence, we can not be certain as to what the
language of the original Chamorro settlers was like. We can only
speculate, with perhaps some help from current comparative
evidence. At least one scholar of comparative languages in the
Pacific area claims that the closest relatives to Chamorro are
Maanyan (of Borneo) and West Futuna, in the New Hebrides
(Dyen 1962:43). His claims are based upon the relatively high
percentage of common vocabulary items that are shared among
these languages.
Chamorro belongs to the family of languages known as
Austronesian. My own opinion is that Chamorro is a Philippine
type language, and its closest linguistic relatives are probably
Ilokano and Tagalog. This opinion is based on the many similarities in the grammatical structures of the languages and, in particular, the focus system of the languages. (More will be said
about this later in the section on grammar.) It is quite possible
that these similarities in the grammatical devices were borrowed
from Filipinos with whom the Chamorros traded. However, this
is very unlikely. Speakers of one language often borrow words
from another language, but very seldom, if ever, do they
borrow grammatical features.
We will leave the question of when and how the Chamorro
language first became a separate language to those who are more
interested in reconstructing history. The important thing for
modern students of Chamorro—both native speakers and
others—to bear in mind is that Chamorro is not a dialect of any
other known language. It is a separate and distinct language in
itself, just as German, Japanese, and English are separate and
distinct languages. There are dialects of Chamorro, namely the
dialects of central Guam, southern Guam, Rota, and Saipan.
But these dialects simply reflect slightly different ways of speaking
the same language —Chamorro. As we will see, Chamorro has all
of the regular rules and complexities that are found in all languages of the world. Some of the rules for Chamorro are similar to
rules found in related languages. But most of them are distinctly
Chamorro.
One very remarkable thing about the history of the Chamor-INTRODUCTION4ro language is its ability to survive. In spite of the drastic reduction
in population during Spanish times to an estimated 3,678 speakers (Thompson 1947:57), the language survived. In spite of
intensive efforts by Spanish and American administrative authorities to "" s t a m p o u t "" Chamorro, the language survived. In
spite of the current ""Americanization"" of the Marianas, complete with mass communications and education in English, the
language is still surviving. I, for one, hope that it will continue to
survive.
There are those who maintain that the C h a m o r r o language
is dying out. There are even those who are anxious to hasten its
death. If such is indeed the case, let us hope that something can
be done to stop this trend. C h a m o r r o is the native language of
the Chamorro people. It forms a very critical part of their social
and personal vitality. It is the language they use to communicate
their most intimate thoughts to their God and their loved ones.
It is the language they use for fun by playing with both the
sounds and meanings of words. It is the language they use to
create dreams and fantasies and for secret thoughts. F o r the
Chamorro people to lose this language would be a great loss
indeed, one that could never be replaced.
I am hopeful that the Chamorro language will continue to
survive. People without a language are poor people indeed. I
hope, too, that this grammar may contribute in some small way
to its survival.","[14, 15, 16]"
"INTRODUCTION6ro grammar led to incorrect arrangement and classification of
many words. Yet, it is still a most useful dictionary for English
speakers studying Chamorro.
H. Costenoble. H. Costenoble was the last of the German grammarians who worked on Chamorro. Having learned to speak
the language as a child on Guam (from 1905 to 1913), he is the
first of the grammarians to have a high degree of fluency in the
language, at least by his own account. His work, Die Chamoro
Sprache (1940), the result of over fifteen years' work, is a complete grammar, filling 550 pages and containing a vast amount
of illustrative material. Unfortunately, its contents are not accessible to most Chamorros and Americans because they are written
in German. Also, many of his examples are rejected by Chamorro
speakers because they are ungrammatical.
The Present Study. It is hoped that the present study will include
as much information about Chamorro as the preceding ones and
will present it in a way that will reveal as clearly as possible its
very complex grammatical system. As stated previously, it is
hoped that Chamorro people—especially the students—will be
able to learn about and have respect for their language through
using this book.
F O R E I G N INFLUENCES ON C H A M O R R O
1.4Like a canoe blown by many winds, the Chamorro people and
language have been subjected to several different foreign influences. All of these have left some mark on the language.
Spanish. The most notable influence on Chamorro language and
culture came from the Spanish. In addition to bringing Christianity and its many cultural by-products to the Marianas, they
brought a language which left a permanent mark on Chamorro.
There was wholesale borrowing of Spanish words and phrases
into Chamorro, and there was even some borrowing from the
Spanish sound system. But this borrowing was linguistically
superficial. The bones of the Chamorro language remained intact;
a little Spanish flesh was added through vocabulary borrowing,
but Chamorro remained basically Chamorro.
In virtually all cases of borrowing, Spanish words were
forced to conform to the Chamorro sound system. For example,
from Spanish verde 'green' we get Chamorro betde, and from
Spanish libro 'book' we get Chamorro lepblo. The substitution of7INTRODUCTIONChamorro sounds for Spanish sounds is quite consistent, and is
discussed under section 2.9 ""Chamorrocized Spanish.""
For examples of how Spanish words were forced to conform
to the rules of Chamorro grammar, note the following:
Spanish:
Chamorro:cuentos 'to talk'
Kumekuentos hao.
'You are talking.'","[17, 18, 19]"
"It is possible that in Chamorro the pronoun ma can be used as an
impersonal pronoun, which could also be translated as passive
voice. A similar situation is found in English. For example, the
following two sentences are very similar in meaning:
They say that smoking is bad for your health.
It is said that smoking is bad for your health.
The first sentence uses the impersonal 'they'; the second uses the
true passive construction, also called extraposition.
For purposes of clarity in the Chamorro writing system, the
pronoun ma is written separately, and the passive voice marker
is written as a prefix. Thus, we get the following in written Chamorro:
Ma li'e' i palao'an.
'They saw the woman.'
Mali'e' i palao'an.
'The woman was seen.'
ma- Verbalizer. This is possibly the least understood of all the
Chamorro affixes, with the possible exception of -in-. It is probable
that in earlier Chamorro it was a productive verb prefix and its
distribution was clearly marked. In modern Chamorro its use is
not quite so clear.
The peculiar thing about the verbalizer ma- is that it occurs
only with certain words. There is no way to predict by general
rules which Class II word will take ma- as the verbalizer ratherMORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTURE193than -um-. The great majority of Class II words take -um- when
they occur as predicates. There are also some words—all of which
begin with m—that take no verbalizing affix (e.g., matai, magap,
matto). And there are some that simply take ma-. Some of these
roots that take ma- and their affixed forms are given here :
Root Word

fondo
haga'
pokkat
cho'cho'

'walk'

'ride'mata'chong
mafondo
mahaga'
mamokkat
macho'cho'
ma'udai'sit down'
'sink'
'be in heat'
'walk'
'to work'
'to ride'It is possible that this Verbalizer ma- is actually the same
morpheme as the Passive Marker ma-. One could think of mata'chong, for example, as a form that means 'to be seated', in which
case the ma- might be considered passive. Such an interpretation
would not fit the prefix ma- on a word like macho'cho' 'to work',
because it would be impossible to think of macho'cho' as a passive
construction. It seems preferable at this point to consider ma- a
Verbalizer which we would like to know more about.
Additional Problems of ma-. The prefix ma- appears to have
become fossilized in a fairly large number of intransitive verbs
and modifiers. That is to say, the ma- can no longer be separated
and identified as a separate morpheme. The following words
probably contain the fossilized prefix ma-.
malagu
malangu
malago'
maleffa'run*
'get sick'
'want'
'forget'makaka
malayu
matuhok'itch'
'wilted'
'sleepy'Since the above words all have three syllables, and since they all
begin with ma-, it is tempting to consider ma- a separate morpheme, as it is in the words mata'chong and
macho'cho'.However,
if we remove the ma- from the words listed above, then we are
left with meaningless stems, as follows:
*lagu
*langu
*lago'*leffa
*kaka
*layu*tuhokOf course, Chamorro does have the words lagu 'north, east' andMORPHOLOGY:WORDSANDTHEIRSTRUCTURElago' 'melt, tear', but these have no relationship in meaning to
malagu 'run' and malago' 'want'. Therefore, we must conclude
that they are different morphemes, and that the ma- of malagu
and malago' cannot be separated.
There are quite a few words in Chamorro that begin with
ma-. Many of these present a very interesting problem. The question is this: Is the initial ma- a fossilized prefix or not?
For several of the words that begin with ma- the answer to
this question is probably no. We can assume that the word just
happens to begin with the sounds represented by ma-. Some of
these words are:
magap
matto
matai
mata
mata'
maila''to yawn'
'to come'
'to die'
'eye'
'raw'
'come'The initial ma- of these words is neither the passive marker nor the
verbalizer. It is simply part of the word.
However, there are several other words of two syllables that
begin with ma- where the ma- is clearly a prefix, as in the case of
macho'cho' and mata'chong. The problem is that the prefix is not
easy to recognize because of the changes that have taken place in
the word after the prefix was added. Look at the examples given
below which show the prefix ma- plus the stem, followed by the
affixed form after it has undergone the sound changes:
Prefix + Stemma + upos
ma + ungak
ma + ipe'
ma + itengpass

'cut open'
'break off'Derived Formma'pos
ma'ngak'past, went'
'tilt, stagger'ma'pe'
ma'teng'cracked'
'broken off'In the above examples, an excrescent glottal stop was inserted
between the ma and the initial vowel of the stem. Then the initial
vowel of the stem was lost. This is a fairly simple sound change.
The following examples will illustrate another type of vowel
loss, namely the vowel following the stem-initial consonant:MORPHOLOGY:WORDS

'drowned'More Fossilized Prefixes. There are still more words in Chamorro
that appear to contain a fossilized form of the prefix ma-. These
words are suspicious because of their phonological structure.
Most native Chamorro words have, or used to have, a structure
that follows the pattern (C)VCV(C), which shows that most
Chamorro root words originally contained two syllables. The
first syllable contained a consonant and a vowel, or just a vowel,
and the second syllable contained a consonant, vowel, and possibly a final consonant. If the word contained a double consonant
in the middle—(C)VCCV(C)—then the double consonant was
geminate, (cf. 2.4.3 and 2.5.)MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTUREWhen we see Chamorro words that do not follow this basic
pattern of consonants and vowels, we have reason to suspect
that the word has been derived from a combination of morphemes. For example, the word mehto 'lousy' violates the standard pattern because it has two medial consonants that are not
geminate. Further analysis shows us that mehto is derived from the
prefix mi- plus hutu 'louse'. All of the derived words listed above
have been reconstructed. There still remain a number of words
that appear to be derived from the prefix ma- plus a stem. At the
present time, however, they cannot be reconstructed because the
original stem has either been lost from the language or has been
completely covered up by the sound changes that resulted from
affixation.
We must conclude, then, that these words probably contain
fossilized prefixes. Some of these words are listed below:
ma gas
mahñao
maktan
masga
ma'son'boss'
'change mind'
'rain gutter'
'repentant'
'unripe
coconut'ma'lak
mangto'
matmo
matfos'shiny, bright'
'pulverize'
'hard rain'
'balding'It has been suggested that mangto' is derived from ma- plus tutong
'pound'. If this is so, the sound changes involved are difficult to
account for.
It is more likely that all of the above words contain a fossilized prefix.
The word maila' 'to come' presents a special case by itself.
In the imperative form it occurs as maila' and mamaila'. In the
continuative form it is mamamaila', as in Mamamaila' gue'. 'He
is coming.' The initial ma of mamaila' is not a verbalizer, as in
the case of mata'chong\ if it were, it and it alone would be used
in the imperative form. Neither is the initial ma- of mamaila' the
reduplicated syllable; for the continuative aspect of maila', we
must say mamamaila' 'be coming'. At this time we must say that
the initial ma- of mamaila' is simply a special case.
Other affixes can also become fossilized. For example, the
word hineksa' 'cooked rice' probably contains the infix -in-, as
in the word nina'i 'gift' (from na'i plus -in-). But, if we remove the
-in- from hineksa' we are left with either *heksa' or *hoksa',
neither of which means anything in modern Chammorro.
The reconstruction of words with fossilized affixes is a veryMORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE197interesting endeavor. It would carry us into the area of etymology,
which is beyond the scope of this book.","[204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209]"
"MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTUREPumipiknik siha gi tasi.

Finally, gi is used with all location words to form a prepositional phrase. In the previous section we used the term locative

words. When any phrase is introduced by a preposition, we may
also use the term prepositional phrase. Some examples of prepositional (and locative) phrases are given here:

I lepblo gaige gi papa' i lamasa.
'The book is under the table.'

'How many pencils did he buy?'
Hayi na palao'an un tungo'?
'Which woman do you know?'
Notice how the linking particle na falls in the same position
before the n o u n when preceded by modifier, demonstrative,
n u m b e r , and question w o r d :
i dankolo na patgon
'the big child'
este na patgon
'this child'
dos na patgon
'two children'
manu na patgon
'which child?'
T h e particle na is also used t o connect a complement
clause
to a main clause. (A m o r e complete discussion of clause types
will be taken u p in the discussion of syntax.) In this situation it
also p e r f o r m s a linking operation in t h a t it links two clauses
together. One might also think of it as the complementizer,
since
it is the particle that introduces the complement clause. Some
examples of sentences in which na is used as a complementizer
are as follows:
Hu tungo' na machocho'cho' i lahi.
'I know that the man is working.'
Ilek-na na u fatto.
'He said that he would come.'
Manmalago' siha na bai hu hanao.
'They want me to go.'
Ilek-hu na ahe'.
'I said no.'
Sen adahi manaina-hu na en fanggaddon gi lasu.
'Be careful my parents that you (don't) get caught in the trap.
Ti bai in sedi jia en fanmafa'ga'ga'.
'We won't allow that you be treated as animals.'
Notice in the following example how the particle na is used to
introduce two complement clauses in the same sentence:
Ilek-niniha na ti ha nisisita na u adelanta mo'na mas i tano'niha.
They are saying that it is not necessary to advance forward their
land.'
In some cases the main clause does not a p p e a r to be a complete
clause, as in the following examples:MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTURE141Hafa na un cho'gue?
'Why did you do it?'
Taya' na pikatdiha bidada-hu.
'Never have I done anything wrong.'
Hafa mohon na pa'go ma chocho'gue enao?
""Why do they do those things now?'
For the time being we will consider hafa and taya' in sentences
like the above to be clauses.
To summarize, the particle na acts as a linking particle.
In some cases it links together two parts of a phrase; in other
cases it links together two clauses, one of which is a complement
clause.
Nai
The particle nai presents certain difficulties in describing how it
functions. It is sometimes used as a reduced form of the subordinator anai 'when'; it can be used in place of the linking particle
na in some cases; sometimes native speakers of C h a m o r r o are
not really certain whether they are saying nai, anai, or na.
In spite of the apparent confusion, there are some rules that
may be given concerning the use of the particle nai.
It appears that there are actually two homonyms pronounced
nai, or that they may be the same word used in different ways.
For present purposes it seems better to claim that there are two
particles pronounced nai. We will call one of them the linking
particle nai; the other we will call the emphatic particle nai.
The linking particle nai has certain specific functions and
some that are not quite so specific. The specific functions will
be considered first.
As a linking particle, nai usually refers to 'place where' as in
the following:
I sanhiyong nai ta maigo'.
'Outside is where we will sleep.'
Giya Tanapag riai mafanagu yo'.
'It was at Tanapag where I was born.'
NOTE: In the two sentences above, nai could also be considered
a complementizer. This will be taken up again in the discussion
of complement and relative clauses.
The linking particle nai is usually used with the following
words when followed by a clause structure: manu, ngai'an, taya',MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTUREguaha, taimanu, and taiguini. Again, the concept of place is often
included. Safford calls nai a 'locative particle', which suggests
that it usually refers to place (1909:108).
Manu nai sumasaga hao?
'Where do you live?'
Ngai'an nai mafanagu hao?
'When were you born?'
Taimanu nai masasangan enao gi fino'-miyu?
'How is that said in your language?'
Taiguini jnai un sangan.
'You say it like this.'
Guaha nai sumasaga yo' giya Susupe.
'There is a place where I live in Susupe.'
Taya' n^i humanao gue' gi plasa.
'He never went to the plaza.'
In the last two sentences above it would perhaps be better to
consider nai a complementizer rather than a linking particle.
The use of nai becomes a little less clear as we examine further examples. The expressions guaha nai and taya' nai usually
mean 'sometimes' and 'never', as in the following sentences:
Guaha nai gumimen yo' setbesa.
'Sometimes I drink beer.'
Taya' nai macho'cho'.
'He never works.'
NOTE: Taya' nai is often contracted to talnai meaning 'never'.
In addition, according to some speakers, one could substitute the
particle na in place of nai in all of the above examples with little
or no difference in meaning. For example, the following sentences
might be heard:
Manu na sumasaga hao?
'Where do you live?'
Ngai'an na mafanagu hao?
'When were you born?'
And it is possible to use both particles, as in the following:
Manu nai na sumasaga hao?
'Where is it that you live?'
Ngai'an nai na mafanagu hao?
'When was it that you were born?'","[151, 152, 153, 154]"
"If you look closely at the nominalized phrases you will see
such things as the infixes -in- and -urn- reduplication, and the
prefix ma-. A good question (which we will not try to answer
here) is: When the affixes occur in nominalized phrases, do they
have the same grammatical significance as they have when they
occur in regular sentences?
There are possibly other types of nominalization that can
be found in Chamorro. Any phrase that can function as the
subject of a sentence is probably a nominalized sentence. The
reader is invited to think of additional examples.
POSSESSION
4.4Possession in Chamorro is highly regular and relatively simple.
The possessive pronouns, which were discussed in section 3.4.1,
are used in most possessive constructions. The possessive pronouns of Chamorro are listed again here:
1st
Singular 2nd
3rdPlural1st incl.
1st excl.
2nd
3rd-hu
-mu
-na'my'
'your'
'his, her'-ta
-mami
-miyu
-niha'our inclusive'
'our exclusive'
'your-2 or more'
'their-2 or more'When one of these pronouns is affixed to a stem, the primary
stress of the affixed form is moved to the penultimate syllable, as
the following examples illustrate:
lapes
lamasa
guma'lapes-hu
lamasa-na
gima'-mami'my pencil'
'his table'
'our house'SYNTAX
If the stem has a medial consonant cluster and ends with a vowel
the allomorph -ku occurs in place of -hu:
tommo
lepblo
kattatommo-ku
lepblo-ku
katta-ku'my knee'
'my book'
'my letter'If the stem ends with a vowel, and if the possessive pronoun
is -mami, -miyu or -hiha, the excrescent consonant n must be
added to the stem:
kareta
lepblo
tatakaretan-mami
lepblon-miyu
tatan-niha'our car'
'your book'
'their father'When the possessor can be expressed by a pronoun, the possessive pronoun is usually affixed directly to the noun. Notice the
following sentences:
Si Juan ha sodda' i gima'-na.
'Juan found his house.'
Si Maria ha taitai i lepblo-iia.
'Maria read her book.'
I famagu'on ma gimen i lechen-niha.
'The children drank their milk.'
Possessive Nouns. When a noun is the possessor there are two
grammatical forms that may occur. One of these forms involves
using the third person possessive pronoun (singular or plural)
as in the above examples, followed by the possessor noun. The
following examples illustrate this type of possessive construction:
i gima'-na si Rosa
'Rosa's house'
i lepblo-iia i estudiante
'the student's book'
i malago'-niha i taotao
'the people's wish'
i lahi-na si Pedro
'Pedro's son'
The other form that can occur when a noun is the possessor
is sometimes called the construct form. This form does not use
the possessive pronouns, but it does involve the final excrescent
n that we saw earlier in the modification constructions such asSYNTAX223
tendan Filipino. This excrescent n occurs when the possessed
noun stem ends with a vowel. The construct form of the possessive
is probably used more frequently than the full form which uses
the possessive pronoun and the noun. The following examples
will illustrate the differences between the full possessive form and
the construct form:
Full PossessiveFormConstructi gima'-ña si Rosa
i lepblon-ña i estudiante
i malago'-ñiha i taotao
i lahi-ña si Pedro
i haga-ña i raiFormi gima' Rosa
i lepblon estudiante
i malago' taotao
i lahen Pedro
i hagan raiThere is probably a degree of difference in meaning between
the full possessive form and the construct form, but the difference
is difficult to translate. For example, the phrase / gima'-ña si
Rosa might be translated as 'Rosa's house', while i gima' Rosa
might be translated as 'the house of Rosa' and might be used
when one is talking about the house as a location rather than as
something that belongs to Rosa.
Possession with Classifiers. The classifiers of Chamorro were
discussed earlier in section 3.5.0. They are often used in possessive constructions when the thing possessed is animal, edible,
inanimate, or drinkable. The classifiers are listed again here:
na'
ga'
iyo
gimen'edible things'
'non-human animals'
'inanimate objects'
'drinkable things'Of these four classifiers the first three are commonly used, the last
one much less so.
The use of na' and ga' is obligatory in possessive constructions. One does not say *i mannok-ku for 'my chicken'. The
statement would have to be made in one of the following ways:
i na'-hu mannok
i ga'-hu mannok'my chicken (to eat),
'my chicken (pet).","[233, 234, 235]"
"SYNTAX213
In the sentence Malagon chaddek gue' we might say that chaddek
modifies the verb malagu. And in the sentence Chaddek malagu
gue' we could say that chaddek modifies the following sentence.
Another instance where there is a close relationship between
a modifier of a verb and a modifier of the sentence can be seen
clearly in the modifier chatta' 'hardly, barely'. This modifier has
another form chat that is used when it clearly modifies a verb.
Notice the contrast in the following two sentences:
Verb Modifier: Hu chattokcha' i guihan.
'I barely speared the fish.'
Sentence Modifier: Chatta' hu tokcha' i guihan.
'I barely speared the fish.'
These examples, which show slightly different forms of the same
word, show the extremely close relationship between modifiers
of verbs and modifiers of sentences.
There are other cases where the modifier clearly modifies
the sentence rather than any particular part of it. In the examples
given below the sentence modifiers are underlined:
Matto gi gipot nigap.
'He came to the party yesterday.'
Todu i tiempo mamaigo' gue'.
'He is sleeping all the time.'
Ensigidas ineppe as Pedro.
'Right away Pedro answered.'
Guaha na bi'ahi na sin sapatos gue'.","[224, 225]"
"Notes on the sentences: Huyong changes to hiyong, mo'na to
me'na, and hulo' to hilo' following gi. This change is explained by
the vowel harmony rule (cf. 2.7.3). The final n of tatte and me'na
(sentences d and f ) is an excrescent consonant (cf. 2.6.2). It
occurs when either tatte or mo'na is followed by a noun phrase.
The location words (with the exception of hulo') can also
form predicates of sentences by simply adding the affix -um- or
man- and a subject. In most cases the meaning is predictable.
There are, however, some special meanings for some of the affixed
forms. In the examples below notice the relationship of the glosses
given for the word given in isolation and in the sentences:
a. halom 'inside'Humalom gue' gi
gima'.
Manhalom siha gi
gima'.",[129]
"MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTURENotice in the following set of sentences how nu, as, and ni (or nu
i) fill the same position:
Ti piniti hao nu hami.
'You don't feel pity for us.'
Ti piniti hao as Pedro.
'You don't feel pity for Pedro.'
Ti piniti hao m patgon.
'You don't feel pity for the child.'
Ti piniti hao nu i patgon.
'You don't feel pity for the child.'
Nu is also found before demonstratives:
Ti hu tungo' hafa bai hu cho'gue nu enao siha.
'I don't know what I will do about those.'
Ti manmalago' siha nu este.
'They don't want any of this.'
Esta ilek-hu sufisiente nu enao i tres na'an ni hu mente.
'I have already said those three names I have mentioned are
sufficient.'
The word nu is also used as a pause particle, or filler. When
used in this way it is not an article, but rather a sort of empty
word . . . something to fill space while the speaker is thinking of
what to say next. The sentence below was recorded during a conversation between two college students on G u a m :
Kuantos afios hao ni fine'ne'na un tutuhon nu humalom umeskuela?
'How old were you when you first started to go to school?'
Of course, nu used in this way is a stylistic device and will vary
considerably from speaker to speaker. The point here is that not
every occurrence of nu is the article nu.
Spanish Articles. The Spanish articles that are found in modern
C h a m o r r o are un, la, and las. They are very limited in their use
and usually occur in fixed idiomatic expressions.
The article un is used with countable nouns when the noun
is both indefinite and singular. It is used when the speaker wishes
to emphasize the ""oneness"" of the noun. In some cases it might
be translated as ' o n e ' :
Un lahi humanao.
'A man went' or 'one man went.'","[147, 148]"
"MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE137Sumasaga un palao'an gi gima'.
'A woman lived at the house.'
Anai hu e'egga' i litratu hu li'e' un guaka, un kabayu, un paluma,

katu.
'When I am looking at the picture I see a cow, a horse, a bird, a
cat up in a tree, and a dog barking at the cat.'
Notice the following pair of sentences for the use of un:
Malago' yo' niyok.
'I want a coconut.'
Malago' yo' un niyok.
'I want one coconut (not two).'
In the second sentence above, the article un is used to emphasize
oneness. (The numeral unu is used when actually counting.)
The article un occurs most frequently in fixed idiomatic
expressions such as Un dia which means 'Once upon a time' or
'One day', and is used for beginning stories.
The article ¡a is not used in Chamorro except in certain words
where it has become a part of the word, in family names, and in
telling time.
An example of a word in which the Spanish article la has
become a part of the Chamorro word is lamasa 'table', which
comes from Spanish la mesa 'the table', where la is the definite
feminine article. In the process of being borrowed into Chamorro,
the Spanish article la simply became part of the word. Another
borrowed word in which the article became fused to the noun
is la'uya 'pot' from Spanish la olla.
The article la is found in family names such as De la Cruz
and De la Rosa, both of which have various spellings, such as De
La Cruz, De la Cruz, and Dela Cruz.
La is also used in telling time. In this case it has become
fused with the Spanish preposition a. The Chamorro form is ala
as in Oran ala una 'one o'clock'.
The Spanish article las is used in Chamorro only when telling
time, and it is fused with the Spanish preposition a when it is
preceded by oran.
Oran alas dos
'Two o'clock'
Oran alas sinko
'Five o'clock'
Dies para las tres
'Ten before three'
Dies pasao las tres
""Ten past three'MORPHOLOGY:138WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTUREIn summary, three of the Spanish articles were borrowed into
Chamorro, but their usage is restricted to those situations described above.
Particles
3.4.7In addition to the articles described above, C h a m o r r o has some
additional ""little words"" that are called particles. In a sense they
are the glue that holds the language together. Although they
are small and almost never receive primary stress, they form a
very important part of the grammatical system of Chamorro.
Because they are ""little words"" and seldom receive primary
stress, they are very difficult for the person who is trying to learn
something about the rules of the language.
The particles that will be discussed here are na and nai.
In many instances in rapid speech they sound alike. This makes
any clear statements about their use even more difficult.","[148, 149, 150]"
"(Some C h a m o r r o speakers claim that the word order in the second
set of sentences above is the preferred order. In any case, both
types of word order are permissible.)
It is possible to construct many variations of the above
sentences. For example, we could take the sentence Ha fahan si
Juan i chandiha and transform it to any of the following:
Si Juan fumahan i chandia.
Finahan i chandia as Juan.
Mamahan si Juan chandia.",[249]
"208SYNTAXMODIFICATION
4.2There are several different types of modification constructions
in Chamorro. Each of them involves a modifier and its relationship to its head (or nucleus). This aspect of Chamorro grammar
is introduced at this time because many noun phrases include
some type of modifier. Our discussion of modification will go
beyond the noun phrase in order to provide an overview of the
different types of modification in Chamorro.
Modification of Nouns. There are two very common types of
modification structures found in noun phrases. One very common
type can be seen in the following examples where the modifier
precedes the headword:
Modifier 4- Headword
i dankolo na taotao
i dikike' na patgon
meggai na bi'ahi
i betde na kareta'the big man'
'the small child'
'many times'
'the green car'Notice that when the modifier precedes the headword, the two
words are joined by the linking particle na. The modifiers which
always precede the headword are Class II words, and their primary
function is that of a modifier. (It will be remembered from sections
3.3.1 and 3.3.5 that practically any word in C h a m o r r o can function as modifier, noun, or verb. The words listed above are
primarily modifiers, but they may also function as nouns, as in
Matai i dikike' 'The little one died.')
When the modifier has a final vowel, the linking particle na
may be reduced to n in rapid speech. Hence, one might hear
such phrases as / dankolon taotao or i buniton kareta. When this
happens, we can consider the final -n a reduced form of the linking particle na.
The other very common modification construction is when
a noun headword is followed by a modifier. In most instances
the following modifier is another noun, but not always. In some
instances one has the choice of placing the modifier before the
headword or following it, as in the following example:
i ekonomia na kareta
i karetan ekonomia'the economical car'
'the economical car'Notice that when the modifier follows the headword that endsSYNTAX209
with a vowel an additional n is attached to the headword. The
nature of this n is discussed in the paragraphs following.
When a headword is modified by another noun, the modifier
always follows the headword. Notice the following examples:
Headword + Noun Modifier
i papet aseru
i gima' Filipino
i relos Amerikanu
i sapatos lahi'the sandpaper (paper of steel)'
'the Filipino house'
'the American watch'
'the men's shoes'When the headword of this type of modification construction
ends with a vowel, n is added, as in the following examples:
HeadwordHeadword + Noun Modifiertenda'store'saga'place'tronko'tree'tendan Filipino
'Filipino store'
sagan apu
'ash tray' (place for ashes)
tronkon hayu
'tree' (of wood)
tommon kannai
'elbow' (knee of the arm)tommo 'knee'The final n found in these modification constructions is
probably not the same as the n found in a phrase such as i dankolon kareta. The final n of the headword-noun constructions
serves no grammatical function. On the other hand, the particle
na in the modifier-headword constructions does serve a grammatical function. It links the two parts of the phrase together.
In constructions where the headword comes first, no linking
particle is required. Hence, the final n seems to serve the purpose
of making the phrase ""sound better."" It is similar to the final n
found in plural possessive constructions such as lepblon-mami
'our book', from lepblo 'book'. (See section 4.4. below.)
The two major types of modification constructions in which
nouns occur as headwords might be described as: (1) modifier
+ na + headword, and (2) headword + noun modifier. In the
second type, headwords whose base form ends with a vowel take
a final n.
Sequence of Modifiers. It should also be noted that nouns can take
more than one modifier at a time. When there are several modifiers for a single headword, they usually precede the headword,
as in the following examples:210SYNTAX
I bunita, guaiyayon yan ti tulaikayon na palao'an
'the beautiful, lovable, and not exchangable woman'
I bibu, bunitu yan guaguan na kareta
'the fast, pretty, and expensive car'
Theoretically there is no limit to the number of modifiers that can
occur with a single headword. More than three modifiers would
probably seem unusual, though not impossible, to most Chamorro speakers.
There are probably some semantic rules that govern the order
of the modifiers. If such rules d o exist, one order of modifiers
should seem preferable to another. Look at the following four
phrases and try to determine whether one of them sounds better
than the others:
1. i guaguan, bunitu yan bibu na kareta
2. i bunitu, guaguan yan bibu na kareta
3. i bibu, bunitu yan guaguan na kareta
4. i bunitu, bibu yan guaguan na kareta
Which, if any, of the above phrases sounds most natural?
Which sounds least natural? If there is any agreement among
native speakers in their answers to the question of naturalness,
then there are probably some rules of Chamorro that are functioning. Perhaps emphasis on one of the modifiers would determine
which one comes first. N o attempt will be made at this time to
determine what the rules are.
Modification of Verbs. There are very few words in C h a m o r r o that
are strictly limited to the function of modification of verbs. All
of the verb modifiers—or adverbs, to use the traditional term—
also serve to modify sentences. As will be shown, there are certain
structural differences when the modifier has a direct relationship
to the verb.
Costenoble lists several different types of adverbs. I would
classify most of his adverbs differently. For example, under the
heading Adverbs of Direction (405) he lists such words as haya
'east',* lagu 'west', magi 'here', and halom 'in'. In the present
analysis, these words are considered simply location words
(cf. 3.4.4). Under Adverbs of Place Costenoble lists such words
as guini 'here', guenao 'there', hihot 'near', and este 'here' (1940:
406). In the present analysis guini and guenao are classed as Loca*For a discussion of the differences in Chamorro directional terminology see
Solenberger 1953.","[219, 220, 221, 222]"
"Sentence 5 is nonfocus and has no particular topic marked
for emphasis. Sentence 9 shows the goal focus construction, but
no topic is marked for emphasis. In sentence 6 the emphasis is
on the topic / taotao since it occurs at the beginning of the sen-256SYNTAX
tence. In sentence 7 there is more emphasis on the N P i taotao
because the verb now contains the actor focus infix -um-. In
sentence 8 the subject N P is emphasized even more because the
verb bende has been nominalized and incorporated into the
subject NP.
Sentence 9 shows a simple goal focus construction which
has the effect of placing some emphasis on the object N P i kareta.
However, in sentence 9 there is nothing marked as the topic, that
is, nothing in the sentence has been singled out for special emphasis. In sentence 10 the object N P has been topicalized by
placing it at the beginning of the sentence. And in sentence 11
the object N P is emphasized even more by the same process that
we saw in sentence 3, namely, the nominalization of the verb
and the incorporation of the verb into the goal NP.
Topicalization is a fairly complex grammatical process.
It is used very frequently when the speaker wishes to place emphasis on one or another of the parts (or constituents) of the
sentence. In some cases the only change that is involved is the
relocation of the topicalized part of the sentence so that it occurs
at the beginning. In some instances additional changes in the verb
are required. We will not go into the formal details of the changes
that take place in the verb at this time. The following sentences
will illustrate topicalization in a transitive sentence that contains
modifiers of manner, time, and place. How would you describe
the differences in meaning of these sentences?

"Modifier to Noun. Modifiers can function as noun-like words
even without affixation. The position in the sentence and the use
of the article i are sufficient.
Hu tungo' i dankolo.
'I know the big (one).'
Hu li'e' i agaga'.
'I saw the red (one).'
Hu guaiya i dikike'.
'I like the little (one).'
Modifiers may also be converted to noun-like words through
adding the infix -in-. Look at the contrasting phrases that follow:
i baba na taotao
'the bad man'MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIR
Infix:STRUCTURE105i binaban taotao
'the man's badness'Some words from the minor class (which are discussed in
section 3.4.) can also change classes as a result of the processes
described above. Two examples will illustrate how this happens:
Location word tatte 'behind'
With infix -um-: Tumatte yo'. 'I went behind.'
Reduplication: tatatte 'progeny, one left behind'
Location word halom 'inside'
With infix -um-: Humalom yo'. 'I went inside.'
With prefix mi- and infix -in-: mihinalom 'intelligence'
NOTE: The last word in the above example—mihinalom—is
often pronounced mehnalom. Can this be explained according to
processes that have been observed in other words?
In addition there are a fairly large number of verbs borrowed from Spanish which are converted to nouns by the same
process that operates in Spanish. This process can be demonstrated by comparing the Spanish and Chamorro below:
Spanish
Chamorroaliviar 'to relieve' becomes alivio 'relief'
alibia 'to relieve' becomes alibiu 'relief'As can be seen from the preceding discussion, it is very common for words to change classes in Chamorro. This is one reason
why it is difficult to claim that a particular word in Chamorro
belongs to a particular part of speech or class. And this is the
major reason why we chose to establish the major classes of words
in Chamorro as Class I, II, and III.
M I N O R W O R D CLASS
3.4The class of minor words in C h a m o r r o contains a rather large but
finite number of words that undergo limited or no affixation.
The words of the minor class are a closed set because words are
seldom added to or lost from this class. The minor class of words
includes such categories as pronouns, prepositions, question
words, and negatives, all of which will be discussed below. The
affixes of Chamorro, of which there are many, will be considered
separately from the minor word class.","[116, 117]"
"MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTURE125The preposition ginen has an alternate form, gini, which is
used very often in rapid conversational speech, as in the expression
Gini manu hao? 'Where are you from?'
The prepositions ginen 'from' and para 'to' have parallel
Spanish forms desde and asta. There is. some overlapping in the
use of these forms. This will be discussed in the following section
on Spanish prepositions.
There is one additional non-Spanish word, as, which seems to
fit partially into the category of Chamorro prepositions. Its status
is not as clear as that of gi, giya, para, and ginen because it also
seems to function as an article in Chamorro. Probably the best
analysis is that there are two words in Chamorro that are pronounced the same but are actually different words. These are
known as homonyms. Hence, we can think in terms of the preposition as and the article as. They are simply two words that
are pronounced the same but have different functions and meanings.
The preposition as 'at a place' does not follow the exact same
grammatical pattern as the other Chamorro prepositions do. It
always precedes the name of a person—either a given name, surname or nickname. The preposition as is usually preceded by the
preposition gi, as in the following examples:
Sumasaga gue' gi as Bernardo.
'He lives at Bernardo's (place).'
Mannangga si Juan gi as Guerrero.
'Juan waited at Guerrero's (place).'
Machocho'cho' si tata-hu gi As-namu.
'My father is working at As-namu.' (Asnamu is a place named
after someone's nickname 'Namu'.)
The preposition gi is not used when the verb (such as falak)
includes the directional element or when the directional element
is not specific:
Malak as Camacho yo'.
'I went to Camacho's (place).'
Hu bende i sine'so'-hu as Camacho.
'I sold my copra at Camacho's (place).'
Spanish Prepositions. The Spanish prepositions used in Chamorro
can be divided into two groups, those that are used freely in combination with Chamorro words to form new expressions (Group I)
and those that are used exclusively or primarily in idiomaticMORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTUREexpressions (Group II). The Spanish prepositions that can be
used freely in Chamorro will be called Group I, and they will be
discussed first. These Group I prepositions are as follows:
desde
asta
sin
pot
kontra(Sp. hasta)
(Sp. por)
(Sp. contra)As mentioned earlier, the prepositions desde and asta are used
in place of the Chamorro prepositions ginen and para in some
cases. For example, one might hear any one of the following
phrases. Notice the different possible combinations of prepositions.
desde Guam asta Saipan
desde Guam para Saipan
ginen Guam asta Saipan
ginen Guam para Saipan'from Guam to Saipan'
'from Guam to Saipan'
'from Guam to Saipan'
'from Guam to Saipan'Of course, not all speakers of Chamorro would use all of the above
combinations of Spanish and Chamorro prepositions. A general
rule is that ginen and para are used more frequently for referring
to space relations while desde and asta are used for time. One
might hear, for example, desde nigap asta agupa' 'from yesterday
to tomorrow', but one never hears *ginen nigap para agupa'.
We might conclude then that desde and asta are sometimes
used to express relationships of space, but ginen and para are
never used to express relationships of time.
Further examples of the use of desde and asta are as follows:
Maigo' gue' desde i painge asta pa'go.
'He slept from last night to now.'
Manmangge' yo' desde i ega'an asta pa'go.
'I have been writing from morning to now.'
Desde i ma'pos na simana
'Since last week'
Ti para u ta fanali'e' asta i Lunes.
'We will not see each other until Monday.'
Asta agupa'.
'Until tomrorow.'
Desde nigap matto yo'.
'I came since yesterday (and am still here).'","[136, 137, 138]"
"218SYNTAXNOMINALIZATION
4.3The term nominalization is used to describe the process whereby
a word, a phrase, or even a sentence can be made to function like
a noun.
Earlier in the section on nouns (3.3.3) some general rules
were given on the identification of nouns. The first rule is that if
a word occupies a position in the sentence that can be designated
""subject of sentence"" or ""object of sentence,"" it can then be
classed as a noun. It is also possible, of course, to find a phrase
or even a sentence functioning as the subject or object of a sentence. When this happens, we can say that the phrase or sentence
has been nominalized.
We might also expand the functions of the nominalized forms
to include the following: indirect object of the verb, object of
preposition, and object complement.
In Section 3.3.5 on Changing Parts of Speech it was shown
how various types of words can be changed through affixation
to function like nouns. When a word has been changed to a noun,
we can say that if has been nominalized. These processes will be
reviewed briefly here. The root word used here is konne' 'to catch'.
Infix: konne' + -in—• i kinenne'
'the thing that was caught'
konne' + -urn—» i kumonne'
'the one that caught'
Reduplication: i kekenne'
'the catcher'
Prefix: i ga'mangonne'
'the one that loves to catch'
i mamakonne'
'the catchable thing'
NOTE: In the two forms illustrating the prefix form of nominalization, more than one prefix has been included. In the first form
ga'mangonne' the Indefinite Object Marker man- has also been
prefixed to the root word konne'. In the second example mamakonne' the passive marker ma- has been added to the stem word
konne' to form makonne' 'be caught'. The word makonne' now
forms the stem for reduplication of the initial CV. The reduplicated form is mamakonne' 'a thing capable of being caught'
or 'catchable thing.'
The examples above all show the nominalized form occurring
with the article i. This is not coincidental. In fact, it could be
argued that the affixes have nothing to do with the process ofSYNTAX219
nominalization. Another way to look at this phenomenon is that
it is the article i that performs the function of nominalization, not
the affix that is used.
It is also possible to nominalize sentences. When this happens, entire sentences are converted so that they function like
nouns. The sentences become noun phrases. There are various
ways by which sentences can be nominalized. Some of the processes will be examined here. We will not go into a detailed analysis
of how every step in the process is made. Three types of nominalized sentences will be considered: stative sentences, intransitive sentences, and transitive sentences.
Nominalized Stative Sentence. A stative sentence is one which
contains a comment and a topic, but no verb. The stative sentence used for illustration here is Dankolo si Juan 'Juan is big.'
This sentence can be nominalized by one of the following processes :
Nominalized PhraseNominalized Phrase in Sentencei dinankolon JuanI dinankolon Juan ha na'manman
yo'.
'Juan's bigness surprised me.'i dinankolo-na si JuanI dinankolo-na si Juan ha na'manman yo'.
'Juan's bigness surprised me.'i dumankolon JuanI dumankolon Juan ha na'manman yo'.
'Juan's development (becoming
big) surprised me.'i dumankolo-na si JuanI dumankolo-na si Juan ha na'manman yo'.
'Juan's state of development surprised me.'","[229, 230, 231]"
"The irregular verb munga does not take any affixes.
Cha'- is similar in meaning to munga, but it is quite a different sort of word. When used with the second person pronoun,
it carries the meaning 'don't':MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTURE91Cha'-mu nanangga.
Don't wait.'
When used with other pronouns, it carries a somewhat different
negative meaning, such as 'won't' or 'had better n o t ' :
Cha'-hu nanangga.
'I won't wait.'
Cha'-na nanangga.
'She had better not wait.'
It will also be noted that the "" m a i n verb"" which occurs with
clia'- is always in the reduplicated form.
NOTE: The reduplicated form of nangga has been converted to
a noun-like word, so that the sentence Cha'-mu nanangga might
be translated as 'Don't be a waiter.' More will be said about
this type of reduplication later.
Siha 'can, may' is another of the irregular verbs that does not
take affixation like the regular verbs. Sifia might be thought of as
an auxiliary verb which functions very much like its English
counterpart 'can.' It should be noticed that the subject pronoun
patterns with sina rather than with the main verb. That is, if the
""main verb"" takes a specific object, then a /iw-type pronoun precedes the verb. If the main verb is intransitive, or takes a nonspecific object, a j o ' - t y p e pronoun usually follows sifia, but may
also follow the main verb. See the following examples:
Sina yo' manli'e' palao'an?
'I can see a woman.'
Sina hu Ii'e' i palao'an?
'I can see the woman.'
Sina yo' gumupu.
'I can fly.'
Sina gumupu yo'.
'I can fly.'
The next three irregular verbs—alok, ga'o- and ya—all have
at least one thing in c o m m o n : they must take possessive subject
pronouns in non-future constructions. The examples cited below
are given with the first person singular subject p r o n o u n :
Ilek-hu ""no"".
'1 said ""no"".'
Ga'o-ku guihan.
'I prefer fish.'
Ya-hu guihan.
'I like fish.'","[102, 103]"
"It will be noticed that the article si never translates into anything
in English. It is, however, obligatory in Chamorro.
It should also be noticed that when the article si is used with
nouns such as nana 'mother', tata 'father', pale' 'priest', and
maga'lahi 'governor', then the nouns are considered proper nouns
and they refer to specific people.
AsMORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTURE131The article as is also used with names of people. Its use is quite
different from si, and it has various translations in English. Note
the following examples of the article as:
Mangge si Jose? Gi as Juan.
'Where is Jose? At Juan's.'
Chiniku si Maria as Juan.
'Maria was kissed by Juan.'
Asnamu.
A place name (lit. 'at the mosquito's').
Ha bende i kinenne'-na as Pedro.
'He sold his catch at Pedro's.'
Lini'e' yo' as Tomas.
'Tomas saw me.'
I gima' as Pale'.
'At Father's house.'
The rules governing the use of si and as are not easy to state
without making reference to certain features of the syntax which
will be discussed later under the heading of Focus System of
Chamorro (section 4.10). For the time being we can say that the
articles si and as are used with proper names of animate beings,
usually people. Even though as often translates as a preposition
in English, it should not be considered only a preposition. It has
all the grammatical features of an article in Chamorro. As is
always used with a proper name when the meaning is 'at someone's place', as in As Juan 'At Juan's place', and it is usually
preceded by the preposition gi.
lya
The article iya is used with place names, as in the following examples.
lya Umatac dikike' na songsong.
'Umatac is a small town.'
Para bai hu falak iya Honolulu.
'I will go to Honlulu.'
Lokka' jya Lamlam.
'Lamlam (mountain) is high.'
When the article iya is used with a location or directional word, it
has the effect of converting the word to a proper place name.
Notice the following examples:MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTUREIya kattan.
'The East.'
Iya hami.
'Our place, our land.'
Nihi ta falak iya hulo'.
'Let's go up (to someone's place).'
In the last example above, the expression iya hulo' suggests someone's house or place because the article iya is used. The same
general idea could be expressed by the following sentence:
Nihi ta falak hulo' gi gima'.
When iya is used, the concept of gima' is implicit and does not
need to be expressed.
The common articles of Chamorro are i, ni, and nu. A complete explanation of their usage will not be possible without going
into the Focus System which will be discussed in a later section
under Syntax. The present discussion will be a preliminary one.
The article i is very similar in both usage and meaning to the
English article the, although it is not always translated. The
Chamorro article i could be considered a ""definite"" article because it marks a definite or specific noun. Some examples of the
article i are:
Hu li'e' i patgon.
'I saw the child.'
I patgon ha hatsa i lamasa.
'The child lifted the table.'
Magof 2 korason-hu.
'My heart is happy.'
Si Don Jose umasagua yan i palao'an.
'Don Jose married the woman.'
I dadalak ^ babui
'The pig's tail'
Notice that the Chamorro article /' is not always translated into
English.
The article i sometimes functions as a nominalizer, which
means that it can cause a verb or modifier to function like a noun.
See the following examples:MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE133munhayan'to finish'i munhayan'the finished
thing'ma'pos
sasaga
gumugupu'past'
'staying'
'flying'i ma'pos

'the stayer'
'the flyer'N O T E : The vowels of munhayan and gumugupu are not fronted
when preceded by i; vowel fronting (cf. 2.7.3) occurs only with
vowels of the stem. The u of both munhayan and gumugupu is
part of an affix, and therefore does not get fronted.","[142, 143, 144, 145]"

contrastive sounds Sounds that contrast in a given language. The
substitution of one sound for another will change the meaning of

the word lata means 'can' or 'container' while the word mata

/ and m are phonemes.

Modifiers
3.3.4Among the Class II words is another subclass that should be
considered primarily as modifiers. They are called modifiers because they serve primarily to modify either verbs or nouns. There
appears to be no reason for further subclassifying the modifiers
as adjectives and adverbs.
Again it must be remembered that verbs and nouns can also
function as modifers. And, on the other hand, modifiers sometimes function as a subject or predicate. There remains, however,
a sizable group of root words whose primary function is that
of modification.
Some examples of words that could be subclassed as modifiers are given here:

Changing Parts of Speech
3.3.5In section 3.3 it was pointed out that a single word can often
function as a verb, noun, or modifier. This is the main reason
why it is difficult to put Chamorro words into a single category
such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. Yet, we did establish the classes
labeled I, II, and III for the major words in Chamorro. In addition, we examined subclasses of these classes, and we referred to
them as verbs, nouns, and modifiers.
It is important to remember that only root words—words
that contained no affixes—were assigned to one of these classes.
In this section we will look briefly at some of the processes
involved when words in Chamorro change from one subclass to
another. These processes are known generally as affixation. The
several types of affixation will be discussed more fully in a later
section. (Cf. section 3.5.2.)
For the present discussion on how words change from one
class to another we must establish some simple criteria for defining
verbs, nouns, and modifiers.
A verb (for present purposes of classification) is a word that
functions as the predicate of a sentence where some action is
involved. (This excludes stative sentences, such as Mediku si
Juan 'Juan is a doctor.') In the sentences below, the verb is underlined:
Ha hatsa si Juan i patgon.
'Juan lifted the child.'
Mamaigo' si Juan.
'Juan is sleeping.'
Gumugupu i paluma.
'The bird is flying.'
A noun (for present purposes) is a word that functions as the
subject or object of a sentence. In the sentences below, the noun
is underlined:
Ha gimen si Juan i hanom.
'Juan drank the water.'","[111, 112, 113]"
"MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRSTRUCTUREThe word hulo' is not included in the above list because it is
irregular. In order to form a sentence with hulo' as the predicate,
it is necessary to add the directional prefix ka- to get kahulo'
'to go up'. The infix -um- can then be added to this stem to form
a predicate.
Kumahulo' gue' gi ekso'. 'He went up the hill.'
(NOTE: The directional prefix ka- found in the stem kahulo'
is no longer productive. It is found in the word kama'gas 'to
become a boss' from ma'gas 'boss', and perhaps in some other
uncommon words. In view of the limited use of the prefix ka-,
an alternative analysis of kahulo' is to consider it as a single
morpheme which is related somehow to hulo'. Chamorro has
several 'directional particles' similar to ka- which will be discussed later.)
It should also be noted that the word hulo' can take the
infix -um- in the expression Humulo'papa' yo' 'I went up and
down.' In this case the two words hulo' and papa' have come together to form a compound word hulo'papa'. This compound
word can take the infix -um- to form a predicate. The word hulo'
by itself requires the prefix ka- when it forms a predicate.
There are two words in C h a m o r r o whose translations might
suggest that they be considered location words. They are hihot
'near' and chago' 'far'. They are similar to the location words
discussed above, since they can take the infix -um- and function
as the predicate of a sentence:
Humihot yo' gi gima'. 'I was near the house.'
C h u m a g o ' yo' gi gima'. 'I was far from the house.'
However, unlike the other location words, hihot and chago'
cannot form a locative phrase with the preposition gi. Note the
following examples:
Gaige yo' gi halom guma'.
'I am in the house.'
Gaige yo' gi hiyong guma'.
'I am outside the house.'
Gaige yo' gi papa' guma'.
'I am under the house.'
Gaige yo' gi fi'on guma'.
'I am next to the house.'
But not:
*Gaige yo' gi hihot guma'.
for 'I am near the house.'","[129, 130]"
"MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE121I salape' gaige gi halom i lepblo.
'The money is in the book.'
I salape' gaige gi sanhalom i balakbak.
'The money is inside the purse.'
As stated earlier, the preposition gi carries a very heavy
functional load in Chamorro. It covers the range of meaning of
several English prepositions, and in some instances it is simply
not possible to translate gi.
Another Chamorro preposition, more restricted in usage,
is giya. It is used only with names of places and with the emphatic
pronouns. The place name may be a proper noun—such as Guam,
Saipan, Merizo—or it may be one of the emphatic pronouns,
hami 'we, exclusive'. (Cf. 3.4.1.) When giya is used with the
pronoun hami, it means 'at my house'; when used with hamyo
it means 'at your house;' when used with any of the other emphatic pronouns, it means 'belonging to', 'to', 'from', or some
other related meaning. Examples showing the use of giya are
given here:
Sumasaga yo' giya Agana.
'I live in Agana.'
Manmatto siha giya Saipan.
'They came to Saipan.'
Hu li'e' gue' giya Toto.
'I saw him at Toto.'
Machocho'cho' gue' giya sanlagu.*'He works in the United States.'
Gaige gue' giya hami.
'He is at my house.'","[132, 133]"
"MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTURE187Manmanokcha' i Ialahi guihan.
'The men speared fish.'
-in- Goal Focus Infix. This infix is used in verb constructions that
are called Goal Focus. This means that focus of the sentence is
on the goal or object of the action. (This will be discussed more
fully in the section on syntax.)
'Hafa lini'e'-mu?
'What did you see?'
Hinatsa i patgon ni lahi.
'The man lifted the child.'
Lini'e' i palao'an ni lahi.
'The man saw the woman.'
-in- Nominalizing Infix. This infix is probably the same as the
preceding one. A technical grammer of Chamorro would probably
show that they both serve the same function, namely to focus
attention on the goal. The nominalizing infix is often used to
convert verbs to nouns; hence its name. This can be illustrated by
the examples below:
Nominalized FormVerb
hasso
faisen
konne'
sangan'think'
'ask'
'catch'
'tell'i hinasso
i finaisen
i kinenne'
i sinangan'the thought'
'the question'
'the thing caught'
'the thing told'In all of the nominalized forms above the noun is the result, or
'goal', of the action of the verb. This is good evidence that the
two infixes -in- are really one and the same.
-in- Adjectivizing Infix. This infix is also probably related to the
Goal Focus infix. When it is affixed to a noun, it converts a noun
or verb to a type of modifier, In this respect, -in- should be classed
as a derivational affix. It is included here because of its obvious
relationship to the other infix -in-. Some examples of the Adjectivizing Infix are as follows:
Root WordInfixed Formpalao'an'woman'i pinalao'an na lahi
'the womanish man' or 'the
man who likes women'a'paka''white'i ina'paka' na magagu
'the whitish clothes'MORPHOLOGY:WORDSAND THEIRpoddong'fall'i pineddong somnak
'the setting sun'somnak'sunlight'i sinemnak na tinanom
'the sunned plant'STRUCTUREThe infix -in- has some additional functions which have not
been described under the three categories of -in- listed above.
These other functions are not easy to explain, due to a lack of
complete understanding of the function of this infix. It appears
that all of the forms which include the infix -in- are somehow
related to its primary function which we are calling Goal Focus.
This means that whenever the infix -in- is used, the "" f o c u s "" of the
statement is on that word which includes the infix: or if -inoccurs in the predicate, then the "" f o c u s "" is on the goal of the
action. (One might substitute the word ""emphasis"" for "" f o c u s , ""
although the two do not mean exactly the same thing.)
Look at the following examples which contain the infix-/«-:
Root WordAffixed Formmagagu 'clothing'
sapatos 'shoes'
relos 'watch'Mjnagagu yo'. 'I got dressed.'
Sinapatos yo'. 'I put on shoes.'
Rinelos yo'. 'I put on a watch.'","[198, 199, 200]"
"The other classifiers—ga', iyo and gimen—also follow this
paradigm.
The classifier iyo is possibly being used less in modern Chamorro than in earlier times. It is still commonly used in many
places in the sense of 'belongs to'.
Iyo-ku i lepblo.
'The book belongs to me.'
Iyo-na ayu na guma'.
'That house belongs to him.'
Iyon-mami na lepblo enao.
'That book belongs to us.'
When iyo is followed directly by a noun, the excrescent n must be
used:
iyon tasi
'belonging to the sea'
iyon lahi
'belonging to the man'
iyon tano'
'belonging to the earth' or 'terrestrial'
iyon langet
'belonging to the sky' or 'heavenly'
Possessive Pronouns as Subject. In certain constructions the
possessive pronouns are used as actor of the sentence. It was
pointed out in section 3.3.2 that certain verbs always take the
possessive pronouns as subject pronoun when used in the nonfuture tense. They are ya-, alok and ga'o:
Ya-hu chumocho.
' I like to eat.'
Ilek-hu ""no"".
'I said ""no"".'

Sentence Modifiers. There are a few words and phrases in Chamorro that usually function as sentence modifiers. They are similar
in some respects to subordinators; that is to say, they modify the
entire sentence rather than any particular part of it. They usually
introduce the sentence, since they usually (but not always) occur
at the beginning of the sentence. Most of the sentence modifiers
are Spanish loan words.
It is difficult to establish a clear definition for sentence
modifiers. Some of them seem to follow the pattern of subordinators. Some of them could be classed as adverbial
modifiers.
(In a Spanish dictionary, most of the Spanish words that occur in
the sentence modifiers of C h a m o r r o are classed as adverbs.) Since
we have avoided the term "" a d v e r b "" for classifying parts of speech
in Chamorro, we will use the term sentence modifier for this group
of words and phrases.
A partial listing of the sentence modifiers is given here. Any
other words or phrases that can be substituted for the ones listed
below could be considered sentence modifiers.
buente — sina (ha') buente 'maybe, perhaps'
Buente gi dos pat tres oras.
'Maybe in two or three hours.'
Sina buente asta despues.
'Maybe later.'","[163, 164]"

Also, in some cases there is no complementizer to introduce
the complement clause. The use of the complementizer appears
to be determined by the verb of the main clause, but the details
of this grammatical feature have not been worked out. The
following sentences illustrate complement clauses that are not
introduced by complementizers:

"MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIRSTRUCTUREOrdering of Affixes. In languages which have as many types of
affixes as Chamorro, it is usually necessary to specify an order
in which the affixes must occur. We don't simply add several
affixes to a stem simultaneously. For example, if a word contains
an infix plus reduplication, is it possible to determine which affix
came first? Is it possible to establish rules for determing which
affix comes first, which one comes second, and so on?
Let us examine the word sumasaga, which contains an infix plus
reduplication, to see if the ordering of affixes makes any difference.
We can start with the root word saga. If we add the infix
first, we get sumaga, which is a perfectly acceptable form. If we
now add the reduplication affix (remember that the rule for
reduplication is to repeat the stressed vowel and preceding consonant of the stem), we get the unacceptable form *sumamaga,
which is often heard in the speech of young children. Obviously
something is wrong in the ordering of affixes if the resulting word
is *sumamaga.
In this particular case we can see that it is necessary to apply
the reduplication rule first: saga -* sasaga. After this first step
we can then apply the infix rule (the infix always goes immediately
before the first vowel of the stem) to give us sumasaga.
Limited rules can be given for the ordering of verb affixes
for Chamorro as follows:
1. Suffixation
2. Indefinite Object Marker man ~ fan - (IOM)
3. Reduplication4. Infixation
5. Plural Subject Marker man ~ fan - (PSM)Some examples will now be given to illustrate why the ordering
of affixes is important.
From the root word peska 'to fish' we can derive famepeska,
which consists of peska, the Plural Subject Marker (PSM) fanand reduplication. What would be the result if we added the prefix
before reduplication?
fan + peska—»fameska(The n of fan- changes to m and the p is lost—consonant assimilation and reduction rule.)
If we now try to reduplicate fameska we would get *famemeska,
which is an unacceptable form. Clearly, the ordering of affixes
in the case o f f a m e p e s k a is as follows:MORPHOLOGY:WORDS AND THEIR
Root:
Reduplication :
PSM:
Cons. Assimilation Rule:STRUCTURE173péska
pépeska
fan + pépeska
famépeskaAnother example to illustrate ordering of affixes is bidanniniha 'their doing'. This form consists of the root bida plus the
possessive suffix niha plus reduplication. If we put reduplication
before suffixation the result would be *bibida-hiha because it is
the stressed vowel and preceding consonant of the stem that is
repeated. The ordering of affixes in the case of bidan-niniha is as
follows:
Root :
Suffixation:bida
bidan-niha (Stress shifts to penultimate syllable)
Reduplication : bidan-niniha
Another example which illustrates suffixation and reduplication is kuentâtayi 'substituting for' which comes from the root
kuénta plus the suffix -yi plus reduplication. The ordering of affixation is as follows:
Root :
kuénta
Suffixation :
kuentâyi
Reduplication : kuentâtayi
One more example will be given here to show that infixation
must precede the prefixation of man- or fan-. The word fanchinémma' meaning 'forbidden things' has the following order of affixation:
Root:
Infixation:chomma'
chinémma' (o becomes e because of precedingPSM:fanchinémma'-in-)If the prefix had been added to the stem, the consonant assimilation and loss rules would have applied, thereby giving fahomma',
which does in fact occur. But, we cannot now apply the infixation
rule to get *fahinemma'. Since the infixation rule is applied first,
the consonant assimilation rule is blocked; thus, we get fanchinemma'. (For an alternate analysis of this form, see the preceding Notes to Linguists section.)
The affixes of Chamorro will be discussed further in the
following section.","[183, 184, 185]"
