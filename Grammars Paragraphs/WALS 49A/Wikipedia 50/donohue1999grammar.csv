the purely verbal level, the object suffixes vary in Tukang Besi, changing depending on theperson and number categories of the object in the clause; these same categories are
irrelevant in Tagalog, in which the same verbal affix being is used for objects regardless of
person or number. At the clause level, however, the noun phrase marking ‘articles’ in
Tagalog show considerable variation, the choice of the article depending on whether the
KP is a commonnoun((48a) and (48e) below), a proper noun ((48c) and (48g)), a162Chapter 7pronoun (in which case a suppletive form of the pronoun is used, as in examples (48b) and
(48f), which may combine with a separate case-marking article as well) or a demonstrative
(which also displays suppletive forms, but which never appear with a preceding article;(48d) and (48h)).

"On the other hand we also find SEMANTIC PIVOTS, those that are determined by the
inherent semantics of the syntactic process to which they apply, such as the addressee of
imperatives being restricted to Agents, regardless of the language’s pivot choice in other
syntactic processes. (Dixon (1994 and elsewhere) claims that the restriction is to arguments
in (S] or [A] function, and this is certainly true for many languages, but this is not the case
in Tukang Besi, in which it is ungrammatical to request someone to be the subject of a
passive verb, or to hear something by chance, or (pragmatically possible with a shaman) to
request the sun to dry something, or the rain to fall (these meteorological requests are
phrased with the natural force as the causer of a causative verb, and thus an agent). Inmany cases the morphological and syntactic groupings that a language distinguishes are
identical, such as the consistent use in English of an [S,A] grouping in its choice of both
morphological pivots (the use of nominative or oblique case on pronouns) and syntactic
pivots (such as conjunction reduction exemplified in (1)).
Furthermore, morphological classification and syntactic pivots don’t have to agree;
Chung noted, in her study of grammatical relations in Polynesian languages, that
The NP categories picked out by the case marking rule(s) of a language may
differ from the categories to which other syntactic rules refer.
(1978:99)
leading to the extra problems of classifying the morphological categories and the syntactic462Chapter 20categories of a language.
So far we have discussed pivots that can be defined in terms of syntactic roles - [A],
[S] (with its subsets) and [O] (as defined in chapter 3, and see also Dixon 1994). There are
also languages with definite, morphologically distinct, pivots that do not operate in these
terms. Good examples of the latter are those languages of the Philippine-type that do not
(despite more than their share of attempts to force them into either an ergative or anaccusative mould. For some examples of these analyses see, amongst many others, Blake
(1991), De Guzman (1988), Gerdts (1988), Guilfoyle et al (1992), Byma (1986). For a
counter to these views, see Foley and Van Valin (1984), Kroeger (1993), Maclachlan
(1995b)) have a fixed choice of pivot, but need to specify in each clause which argument is
the pivot (for most grammatical constructions, including, for Tagalog, Quantifier Float,
Relativisation, Number Agreement, Raising, Possessor Ascension, and Conjunction
Reduction. See Schachter (1976, 1977) or Kroeger (1993) for exemplification of these
properties) - the nominative argument, using the terminology introduced in chapter 3.(I
shall not enter a discussion of the very interesting languages with inverse systems of verbal
indexing, such as various Algonquian languages (see e.g. Wolfart 1973, or more recentlyDahlstrom 1991) and others (Dunn 1995 MS, Donohue 1996d), which also appear to
display mismatches between morphological and syntactic categories, and which also
display wide-reaching morphological reflections of pragmatic status). It is possible for a
clause to select either [A] or [O] to be the pivot of a transitive construction, but each choice
involves morphological choices as well. The choice of which argument is nominative is
presumably determined by pragmatics (although how remains unclear. See Kroeger 1993
(Chapter 3) for a counter view with respect to Tagalog), and indicated by morphology on
both the verb and the nominal. Different Philippine-type-languages may have anything
upwards of two (e.g., Sama/Bajau) basic morphologically distinct pivot choices. As Givén
(1984: 167) puts it,
...case-marking systems of various kinds may be viewed as different solutions
to thesamefunctionaldilemma...Withrespectto subjectivization,thePhilippine solution is in a way rather elegant. Nouns that are not in the
pragmatic case-role of subject/topic are marked for their semantic roles, by
prefixes. The subject/topic noun is marked by prefix for its pragmatic role.
And the verb is marked (by various prefixes/infixes/suffixes) for the semantic
role of the subject/topic.","[487, 488]"

"5.6Scope of possessive antecedencyAll pronominals in a language must have some antecedent which they index; in the case of
the verbal indexes, which are bound up in the system of nominative:antecedency and nonnominative case assignment, the scope of reference is simple. In the case of pronominal
possessive suffixes on nouns, there is no problem in establishing the identity of reference

"3.2.3 Subject and object
The term ‘subject’ has been the source of considerable confusion in the modern linguistic
literature, particularly with respect to the treatment of Philippine-type languages, and
languages with ergative elements to their syntax. ‘Subject’ has been used to describe either
a grouping of [S] and [A] categories that are treated alike with respect to some area of
morphology or syntax, or to refer to ‘the’ grammatical pivot of a language that
some/most/all grammatical processes refer to; the confusion in the terminology comes from
the fact that in the more familiar European languages both uses coincide, but not in other
languages (see Dixon (1972, 1979), Payne (1978), Schachter (1976, 1977) for the basic
description of languages in which the two definitions of the term do not coincide). In this
description the term subject will be used solely to refer descriptively to the first usage: the
collapse of the [S] and the [A] roles, without ascribing any grammatical uniqueness to this
argument.
Object is used to refer to any core argument (see section 3.11.1) that is NOT a subject;
there may be more than one in a predicate, and in that case we can distinguish a primary
object and a secondary object (see chapter 4.5.3 and chapter 10), on the basis of various
morphosyntactic tests. The term object and the syntactic role [O], as defined by Andrews,
are not identical; more than one object may be present in a clause, but in an asymmetricallanguage (as defined by Bresnan and Moshi 1990, and see also the discussion in chapter
10.7), such as Tukang Besi, only one of these may be in the syntactic role of [O].
3.2.4NominativePhilippine-type languages present problems for the analysis of grammatical processes inSyntactic units and the clause49terms of [A], [S] and [O], and ‘subject’ and ‘object’. Analyses of these languages,typically exemplified by Tagalog, have variously ascribed accusative syntax to them (eg.
Guilfoyle, Hung and Travis 1992), or ergative syntax (e.g. Byma 1986), or even as
displaying an essentially nominal character (eg. Starosta, Pawley and Reid 1982, Naylor
1995 and the references therein). Maclachlan (1994) has shown that there is equal
justification for viewing the language as either ergative or accusative, depending on the
approach taken to morphological classification (though see Foley 1991b), and that Tagalog
is better treated as displaying characteristics of both of these categories. Despite this,
Tagalog does not absolutely belong to either of these camps, what Maclachlan calls the
‘hybrid’ hypothesis. Unlike languages with (predominantly) accusative or ergative syntax,
each clause in a Philippine-type language must morphologically SELECT one of the
arguments of a transitive verb as its pivot; there is no unmarked choice (or, rather, either
choice may be interpreted as equally marked); this analysis is thoroughly treated in
Schachter (eg., 1976, 1977) and Foley and Van Valin (1984).
I use the term ‘nominative’ in a sense similar to that employed by Bell (1983) forCebuano and Kroeger (1993) for Tagalog to refer to the case that is assigned to that
selected argument in the clause, regardless of whether that argument is in [A], [S] or [O}syntactic role. In previous literature on Philippine-type languages this pragmatic role has
been referred to as the “focus”, “subject” or “topic”. I use nominative to escape the otherassociations that these terms carry, which can be shown (Kroeger 1993, and paragraph
3.2.3) to be distinct from the nominative pivot. Nominative is used in two senses, to refer
to the morphological case marker na, and also to refer to the unique grammatical function
that may be marked by the article na. The difference between these two uses of the term arefurther described in section 3.8.3.
3.2.5Semantic roles and the thematic hierarchyReference to (A] [S] and [O] syntactic roles, to subject and object, and to nominative or
non-nominative grammatical relations, is not sufficient to describe the syntactic processesthat are found in Tukang Besi. In addition to these, use will be made of a modified version
of the thematic hierarchy as set up by Bresnan and Kanerva (1989). Their version of the
thematic hierarchy assumes the following list of semantic roles, in an ordered hierarchy
(the choice of the label ‘thematic’ or ‘semantic’ is arbitrary; I shall refer to semantic roles,since that is (I believe, perhaps mistakenly) the most wide-spread and unambiguous term; I
shall, however, continue to refer to the ‘thematic hierarchy’ as an ordered list of theseterms, since ‘thematic hierarchy’ is a term that has become established in the literature):
agent > beneficiary > goal/experiencer > instrument > theme/patient > locative
See Roca, ed., 1992, for many further works and bibliographies of works that have
used the thematic hierarchy as an explanatory tool. Important discussion on the use of
semantic roles in grammar can be found in Dowty (1991), and much earlier work on aslightly differently ranked thematic hierarchy can be found in Foley and Van Valin (1984).
Bruce (1984) explicitly uses an early version of the thematic hierarchy as an explanatory
tool in his grammar of Alamblak, and Carrier-Duncan (1985) uses a version of it in a study
of derivational word formation.
The workings of Tukang Besi grammar do not provide evidence for all these50Chapter 3distinctions. Since this grammar is intended primarily as a description of the workings of
Tukang Besi, only those divisions necessary for such are description are employed here.","[74, 75, 76]"
"OBL _ there:higheriajxp[no-tinti)yp[nutuha-su)xp.s/he3R-runGENfamily-1SG.POSSThese characteristics lead us to assume that nu is an article, but with differentdistributional restrictions from both core and oblique articles. The form of the genitive
article is most typically nu (or its allomorph u); it can, however, especially in the speech of
people from the south western coast of Wanci, and those areas in the court of Lia, or those
with associations with Buton, be heard as no, probably modelled after the suffix -no that isfound in the languages of Muna and Buton (with the exception of Wolio, the Sultanate
language). For example, we find sentences such as (8)' in Muna (van den Berg 1989:86):
(8)'—_ roo-noSauleaf-postree‘leaf of a tree; vegetable’
In these languages, however, it is clear that it is actually the possessive suffixes that are
used, and not a separate genitive case marker. Compare example (10b) with the following
Muna phrase (van den Berg 1989:85):
(10)e.guru-ku
inodi
teacher-my
I
‘MY teacher’ (not yours).’Clearly the genitive construction is treated differently in Tukang Besi, compared to the
Muna possessive construction. The genitive case marker is independent of person andnumber of the possessor, and is not suffixed onto the head noun (Tukang Besi would
require te guru nu iaku as a translation of (ii), and not allow * te gurusu iaku). This is alsodiscussed in chapter 5
13.2.3Internal structure of a genitive phraseFrom the examples above it can be seen that the appearance of a genitive phrase (or
possessive suffix) serving to modify a noun is obligatorily within a noun phrase. It can be
shown, however, that the NPs that may appear in genitive KPs are non-nominative, and
do not display the internal structure associated with nominative NPs. This can be
corroborated by the lack of ambiguity in strings that might be naively thought to be
ambiguous. Examine the KP containing a genitive case phrase in (18):
(18)Jari
sono-mohoo na
3R-sore
NOMpaa
thighno
GENbonto
ruler‘So that mentioned thigh of the ruler was sore.’iso
yonba’.
PREV* ‘So the thigh of that mentioned ruler was sore.’
Here it might appear to be the case that the demonstrative string iso ba‘t occurs modifying342Chapter 13a nominative noun phrase, not allowed by the rules governing NP structure (see chapter12). In fact this interpretation is not allowed, and the demonstrative can only be taken to be
referring to the NP inside the genitive phrase, and not the NP outside the genitive phrase.
This provides evidence that NPs within a genitive phrase are non-nominative, regardless ofthe case of the KP in which they are found. This can be represented in the structure seen in
(18)’, which is contrasted to (18)"", not a possible constituent structure representing (18),since it assigns a demonstrative choice that is only available to a non-nominative NP to the
nominative NP that is part of the outermost KP.","[367, 368]"

WaDarwinFor this reason we need to recognise a larger constituent in Tukang Besi which consists ofthe NP and its preceding case-marking article. The terminology for such a constituent
exists, proposed by Fillmore (1968), and used more recently by Lamontagne and Travis
(1987), Kroeger (1990) and others, as well as a long descriptive tradition within
(lexi-)case grammar. A NP that is preceded by a case-marking article is assumed to be
nested inside a Case Phrase (KP); when an NP appears without a case article, having only
a preposition preceding it, it is a simple NP. It is understandable that the oblique casemarker has come to be omitted following some prepositions, since the use of a preposition
already signals the nominal as oblique, and moreover more finely specifies the semantics72 Chapter3
of the relation. We can hypothesis that a pre-Tukang Besi had only the oblique case i, and
that the other ‘prepositional’ forms are more recent additions to the language. mina andkene are still used as verbs, and kua (southern variant ka) is clearly derived from Malay
ka. Only apa has no clear etymology, and this is the preposition that must appear with a
complete oblique case marked KP following it. The structures proposed for these two
phrases are seen in (79) and (80). The structure associated with a KP is that given in (79)
(details in chapter 12):
KP
oOART(79)NPRead ima modifiers
Te
mia
to'oge.
CORE
person
big
‘the big person.’A prepositional phrase with the preposition kua, which has as its sister an NP which does
not use articles, has an apparently nearly identical structure, seen in the putative tree for
(80), but this is only the result of a missing oblique article, as (80)' shows:
PP
oOPREPNPhead na modifiers

eoPREPKP—_—ARTNPead(80)'an
apa

ENDPOINT OBL _ house
‘up to the big house.’ers
_to'oge.
bigFrom (80)' we can see that the PP takes a KP as its object; indeed, kua i wunua to'oge is
also acceptable, though more marked. We must conclude that some PPs unusually allow a
non-headed KP as the sister of the preposition; since a preposition already specifies the
non-core status of its argument, the oblique case marker is simply double marking of thatfact, and so in some cases may be dispensed with.
The internal structure of the Noun Phrase is dealt with at length in Chapter 12; here I
will only mention that the NP is head-initial, and that some details of the structural
organisation of the NP depend on the pragmatic status assigned to the argument
(nominative case is explicitly marked by the choice of na or preverbal position, as the
article for the KP (all non-core NPs have the structure associated with a non-nominativeSyntactic units and the clause73NP)). The crucial aspects of this variation are the choice of demonstratives available at the
end of the NP, and the ordering of the constituents in the N' at the beginning of the NP.
The ordering of the two different types of N' constituents is as follows:
Nominative NP:N'
N_(81)-POSSADJ(na)wunua-sumolengo.","[97, 98, 99]"

3.5Non-verbal clauses3.5.1Core noun phrase predicatesEquative expressions are presented in a non-verbal clause, with two core case phrases
juxtaposed with each other. The unmarked order presents the subject first followed by apredicate in a non-nominative case phrase, the opposite order to that which is found with
an intransitive verbal clause. If the subject is emphasised it appears as a nominatively
marked NP after the predicate. Equative clauses are used for naming objects, adding
information about a known entity, and presenting a referent for a question word.",[82]
"Chapter 12
Noun phrases: core and oblique phrases
12.1Noun phrase structure and the case phraseIn Tukang Besi the basic NP appears inside a KP, since all NPs must appear either with a
preceding article or with a preposition (for certain obliques), sometimes both (some time
expressions violate this otherwise fast rule; see chapters 3 or 17). As described in chapter
4, there are four articles used to mark case relations: the nominative na, the non-nominative
core te, the genitive nu, and the oblique i/di. The genitive case nu, and other issues
concerning possession, are discussed in chapter 13, and do not feature here. Preposition
Phrases are described in the second part of this chapter, and the first part deals with NP
structure in general, and the properties of core KPs. These minimally consist of the head of
the NP, which is typically a noun (N), plus an article. A minimal KP is, thus, an article
followed by an NP headed in the N position, as seen in (1) and (2):

Additionally, the free pronouns are used when the possessed entity has exclusivereference in the conceptual world. In this case, there is neither a genitive article nor a
possessive suffix, and the free pronoun is simply placed immediately following the
possessed object:
(10)a.",[365]
"3.11.1Core argumentsThe arguments that may be indexed on the underived verb are limited. Without the addition
of applicative morphology, only arguments in [Agent], [Dative], [Instrument] or
[Theme/Patient] semantic roles may be indexed on the verb (if that verb’s subcategorisation
frame calls for an argument in that semantic role), and without the use of applicative
morphology only these arguments may be selected as the pivot in various constructions
(some grammatical constructions automatically select a pivot because of the particular
syntactic or semantic role that it bears, which is not a variable; see chapter 20). The fact
that a single semantic role (illustrated with [Dative]) may appear indexed on the verb as
either subject or object, depending on the verb’s subcategorisation frame, has already been
seen in 3.4.1. This point is exemplified in more detail in chapter 20, and the use of
applicative morphology is dealt with in chapter 10.
We have seen that verbal indexing is an option only available for core arguments.
Further arguments that can be used to establish the special status of core arguments are:
°core arguments are obligatorily marked by articles on their KP, whilst
oblique nominals are often grammatical with just a preposition, dropping the
oblique article i.
(the verbal origins, and verbal characteristics, of some of these prepositional
forms, are mentioned in chapter 4, and chapter 12. See chapter 12 for a chart
summanising the differences in use of the prepositions and articles)
only core arguments may launch floating quantifiers (if nominative) or
floating adverbs (if non-nominative);
only core arguments may be relativised, using the subject relative clause or
the object relative clause;°in nominalised constructions, or if the verb is in an object relative clause,
possessive suffixes or genitive phrases may only indicate the core arguments
of the verb ;Andrews (1985: 82) writes that “One set of cases, commonly called ‘syntactic’ cases, codethe core functions”, and that “NPs with ‘syntactic’ cases tend to express a wide range of
semantic functions and to be targeted by rules sensitive to grammatical function”. The
evidence from Tukang Besi would support the conclusion that the articles re and na are
primarily used to mark core arguments.
Examples of floating adverbs and floating quantifiers are given in Chapters 7 and 20,
respectively; it is shown there that they can be floated only with reference to a76Chapter 3(non-nominative or nominative, respectively) core argument. Nominalisation is alsocovered in chapter 12, but some examples are given below. The basic verbal sentence is
presented in (90), and (91) is a grammatical nominalisation based on that sentence; (92),
on the other hand, which marks the oblique i wale wale as a genitive phrase in thenominalisation, is not grammatical, offering an important point on which core and noncore arguments differ:

"The use of free pronouns is associated with the introduction or reintroduction of a
participant into the discourse, or with the switching of emphasis to new referents in
discourse. That the pragmatic roles are changing is indicated by the presence of the free
pronouns, but the precise grammatical role played by the participants to which the
pronouns refer is indicated by the article used with the pronoun (te ‘non-nominative core’
or na ‘nominative’) in combination with the verbal morphology (see chapter 3) (In Bresnanand Mchombo’s (1987b: 23) terminology these are referred to as nonargument functions,
“such as TOP,FOC,and ADJUNCT”and argument functions “such as SUB,OBJ,OBL(ique)” ). Since an article can only govern an NP, and not a pronominal affix, the free
forms must be used, as the head of an NP, in order for this system of changing article use
to be productive.
Morphological possibilities with a free form pronoun are extremely limited. The onlyaffixing that has been observed is the addition of the emphatic suffix -mo:
(33)a.",[148]
"This is the case in most languages with a split-intranistive system. Other languages,
such as Lamma (Timor—Alor—Pantar family, own fieldnotes) group unergative subject
({Sa]) with [O], and unaccusative subject ({So]) with [A]. Kolana, of the same
family, has a split-intransitive system, but one in which none of the three ways of
expressing the intransitive subject are the same as that used to indicate the [A] (own
fieldnotes, thanks to Johanna Nichols). Choctaw (Davies 1986) also shows a three—
way split in the verbal indexing of intransitive subjects, and several Dagestanian
languages show three different patterns of case-marking on the subjects of
intransitive verbs. The most common form of split intransitive system, however, is
that exemplified by Eastern Pomo (McLendon 1978).",[582]
"At the other end of the NP to the Demonstrative position is the N’, which is also fixed
in the position beginning the NP, and consists of a fixed group consisting of the nominalhead, any adjectives, and any possessive suffixes. All of the other modifiers in the Noun304Chapter 12Phrase occur after the N'; there are no pre-head modifiers in an NP, and nothing in the KPappears before the article. The choices available for the Demonstrative position depend on
the case of the KP as a whole, and there are two different internal structures for an NP,again depending on whether the argument represented by the KP is nominative or nonnominative. The basic non-nominative NP has an ADJ position before the -POSS; this isthe major distinguishing feature of this NP type over the nominative NP type, whose ADJ
position follows a -POSS, and one of the clear points of distinction between verbs and
adjectives. The following basic structures are attested:

19.1Speech acts: introductionA discussion of sentence types must include reference to both the number of distinctions
that a language makes in terms of morphosyntactic peculiarities that a particular sentence
type possesses, and the different types of speech acts that may be carried out by the use of
one and the same grammatical category. Most researchers into the topic (e.g. Searle 1979)
make a distinction between SITUATIONAL CATEGORIES, which are concerned with the
intent of the speech act regardless of the sentence type used, and GRAMMATICAL
CATEGORIES, which are sentence forms used to realise the different situational categories.
Important to this thesis is that these different categories do not share a one-to-one
relationship; whilst a statement is usually realised as a sentence with the grammatical
category of declarative, for instance, this is not always the case. Sinclair and Coulthard
(1975:29) state that
Of the nine possible combinations—declarative statement, declarative question,declarative command,
imperative statement.and so on—there is only one we cannot instance:They give the following example of an indirect correspondence between categories:
The interrogative, ‘What are you laughing at?’, is interpretable either as a
question, or as a Command to stop laughing.
The different situational and grammatical categories that they found necessary to
distinguish their recorded data in English are as shown in figure 12:
Situational categoryGrammatical categoryStatementDeclarativeQuestionInterrogativeCommandImperativeFigure 12. Situational and grammatical categories
The same facts are found in general terms in Tukang Besi; whilst a grammatically
imperative clause is the most common way of expressing a command, it is not the only
way, with both interrogative and declarative clauses used for the same function (though448Chapter 19often with different nuances in terms of politeness and abruptness). Note that each
situational category has a grammatical category that corresponds to it, but is not restricted
to using that grammatical category alone.","[471, 472, 473, 474]"

"3.5.2Oblique predicatesClauses with oblique predicates are similar to equative clauses in their structure, except that
the predicate nominal is in an oblique case phrase or a prepositional phrase, and the subjectnominal is found initially in most cases. When being questioned the predicate may be
fronted, and the subject nominal nominatively marked, but this is rare (in the matrix below

phrase).",[83]

As has been described in chapter 3, the type of verbal indexing (presence versus absence
of object suffixes) correlates with predictable variation in the case marking on nominals,
and variation in their syntactic behaviour (see chapter 20), showing that the variation in
case is not merely morphological.
This is exactly the same correlation exhibited by the better-known verbal affixes and
KP marking in various Philippine languages, as demonstrated by the following pair of
sentences from Tagalog (I am not going to enter the debate about the theoretical
significance of what has here been blithely termed ‘focus’, or the nominal versus verbal
nature of the affixed words in Philippine languages, in this book. For a discussion of these
question, see (amongst (many) others) Schachter 1976 and 1977, and Kroeger 1993. The
glosses in Tagalog sentences follow Kroeger’s conventions):

In most cases involving the verb hu'u there is no possible confusion between the
recipient and the theme arguments, which are case marked the same way in (10), orbetween the recipient and theme objects, identically case marked in (9), and so the wordorder is not fixed. There are possible sentences in which both the recipient and the theme
are animate, as seen in (12):
(12)Noj-hu'u

change in the meaning:
(13)Noj-hu'u3R-giveteCOREtudu‘a,—slaveteCOREraja).ruler‘She gave the king to a slave.’
* ‘She gave a slave to the king.’
We can see that there is a preference, when potential ambiguities present themselves, to
have the recipient precede the theme (though compare (13) with (9), where there is no
potential for ambiguity, and no restriction on the relative ordering of the two objects).
With ditransitive verbs that have an optional instrument as well as an agent and a
patient (see chapter 4.5.1 for details on this), the order is fixed: the patient must precede
the instrument, as seen in (14) and (15):(14)Noj-tompa-'e;

"20.14SummaryThere is no one unified concept of the pivot in Tukang Besi, in the sense that one set of
grammatical relations is the pivot for all constructions in the language. Even discountingthe fairly universal pivot that seems to apply for imperatives and some Equi constructions,
there is more than one pivot in Tukang Besi which a grammatical process can refer to, and
often an argument is the pivot for some processes, but at the same time not for others. The
labels “ergative’ and ‘accusative’ cannot be applied to the whole of Tukang Besi in any
meaningful sense, only to individual grammatical constructions.
Perhaps more importantly, the notion of pivot in Tukang Besi is one not just based on
one set of criteria. Languages such as English or Yup'ik Eskimo (Payne 1982), and many
more, may all be characterised as having pivots based on syntactic categories (hence the
use of the labels [A], [S] and [O], referring to syntactic roles). Typically, the language has
either an [S,A] pivot, or an [S,O] pivot, though some languages refer to both of these for
different processes (such as several Mayan languages; see Craig 1977, Day 1973, England
1983, Bear 1992). Other languages, such as Archi (Kibrik 1979) or Aceh (Durie 1985,
1987, Foley 1991b) appear to refer to the semantic roles directly, without the need to
mediate these by means of syntactic roles (or grammatical functions, such as ‘subject’ and490Chapter 20‘object’). Yet others, notably those of the Philippine group, have a stronger orientation
towards the direct encoding of pragmatic prominence, and do not operate directly in terms
of either syntactic roles or semantic roles (Thai appears to be a language with a pragmatic
pivot, but with no morphological coding of the pivot choice.).
The pivots in Tukang Besi, however, are divided amongst those that are based on
syntactic roles, those based on pragmatic factors (i.e., set by discourse constraints, with afair degree of freedom), and those that are dependent on semantic roles directly, regardless
of their syntactic status. Additionally, the existential construction presents a mix of
properties from several of these types, none of them as complete as a ‘normal’ verbal
clause presents.
In short, whilst the labels [A], [S] and [O] are useful shorthand in a description of a
language such as Tukang Besi, they are not sufficient, and moreover, as has been seen in
sections 20.14.1 - 20.14.3, these syntactic roles are actually predictable for a given clause
if we know the subcategorisation frame of its verb. That is, given the argument structure
representation of semantic roles in the predicate, the syntactic roles [A], {S] and [OJ are
derivable concepts. The assignment of nominative case does not follow from any automatic
process similar to the assignment of the [A], (S] and [O] syntactic roles, but is similarly
based on the information present in the thematic hierarchy and thus the subcategorisation
frame of the verb. Some processes, notably the ability to head an Instrumental relative
clause, are sensitive only to semantic role information, and not to syntactic role
information. We must, therefore, look past the labels [A], [S] and [O], the grammatical
relations ‘subject’ and ‘object’, and the Philippine-style notions of nominative and nonnominative arguments, if we are to economically describe the full range of grammatical
processes that are operating in Tukang Besi. Realising that all the processes are easily
explainable in terms of the relative ordering provided by the thematic hierarchy, we can
propose one underlying system that accounts for the large range of different groupings of
arguments that are accessible to different grammatical processes in the language.","[515, 516]"
"ANA‘She’s already gone home! Wa Yani, that is.’3.8Articles and case markingWe have seen that the structure and choice of nominative or non-nominative case of the
arguments in a clause in Tukang Besi is monitored to a large extent by the pronominal
affixing on the verb, and the choice of articles on nominals. This section summarises the
used of the two core articles, na and fe, in both verbal and non-verbal clauses. There are
constructions that use KPs (NPs with case-marking articles), and yet more that use bare
NPs, without articles; these are now dealt with separately.
3.8.1Nominative naThe nominative article na is restricted in its functions, being a marker of a unique position
in the clause. It can only be used to mark a core argument that has been selected as being
the nominative pivot in that clause. The syntactic ramifications of an argument being the
nominative pivot are dealt with in more detail in chapter 20, though some examples will be
seen in 3.8.3. Givenness, definiteness and referentiality are all pragmatic notions that are
bound up in the specification that is part of a nominative argument’s pragmatic
representation.
3.8.2Non-nominative teIn contrast to the nominative article na, the other article used to mark core arguments, fe,
has a wider range of functions. It is used to markChapter 3AkWH=64non-nominative core arguments;fronted core arguments with nominative case;
predicates of a non-verbal clause;
topicalised core arguments;
the argument in [Cause] role (for certain bodily sensations);The first use, the marking of non-nominative core arguments, is unproblematic, involvingonly the specification that after the nominative KP has been determined, all other core
arguments are assigned the article te. In 3.7.1 we saw that a clause may have a variant in
which the nominative KP is fronted, but remains within the clause, and is marked with te.
In 3.5.1 we saw that both the nominal predicate and the subject of a non-verbal clause are
marked by the non-nominative article fe; this means that both of the NPs are marked in the
same way unless the clause presents a fronted predicate, with only constituent order todistinguish the two arguments (since the clause is equative anyway, this is not really a
problem). With topicalised constructions a core argument is also marked by fe; in order not
to describe a clause-external argument with the gloss CORE, the gloss TOP is used in this
context. Two experiencer verbs, mo‘aro ‘hungry’ and motindo'u ‘thirsty’ allow an
optional ‘object’, the cause of the sensation, to be present in the clause, and marked by te.","[89, 90]"
"Syntactic units and the clause
3.10.271Noun PhrasesThe fact that Tukang Besi needs to distinguish between the Noun Phrase (NP) and the
Case Phrase (KP) has already been foreshadowed. The argument for this is that theparadigmatic roles that the constituent traditionally called the ‘NP’ plays in clauses can be
summed up as follows:
°
°
°serve as a direct (core) argument of a verb;
be the unit replaced by a clause in a complement construction;
be the sister of a preposition in a preposition phraseIt is true that the first two of these functions are played by the one constituent in Tukang
Besi; compare the following two sentences:
(75)Dinggawiku-'ita-'e[naWa Darwin — r{um]ato)-:np°.yesterday 1SG-see-30BJ NOM WaDarwin

‘I saw Wa Darwin arrive yesterday.’

3R-arrive‘I saw Wa Darwin arrive yesterday.’na
NOMWa Darwin]comp.
Wa DarwinHowever, when we examine the structure of a prepositional phrase, we find that anoblique case article + NP constituent is not always the constituent that is the sister of the
preposition. In (77) mina takes a case article + NP sister, but in (78) the preposition kuaoccurs with no article, and indeed cannot occur with an article when specifying motion
towards a person, as seen by the ungrammaticality of (78)':

"COREcatNOM2SG‘The cat bit you.’

3R-bite‘The cat bit you.’
In both (6a) and (7a) the agent beka is indexed on the verb by the third person realis
subject prefix no-, and additionally in (6) the second person singular object is indexed by
means of the second person singular object agreement marker -ko. When this agreement
marker is not used, as in (7), the agent beka must be marked by the nominative article na,and iko’o by the non-nominative article te. This variation in the presence or absence of
object agreement is the only way that the case assigned to nominals may be changed; note
the ungrammatical (6b) and (7b). Clearly, the presence or absence of object agreement on
verbs functions as a form of voice system. The analysis adopted here is that it is a
Philippine-style voice system, with a restricted range of categories, two (a stronger case
for this position is put in Chapter 7.6.1, and an alternative is considered in 7.6.2). In
Tukang Besi the diachronic drift towards head-marking pronominal indexing has
proceeded to quite an extent, but at the same time the overt Philippine-style case system has
been preserved, and its verbal cues reinterpreted as being those involving the presence
versus absence of the object agreement.
Although the transitive verbs we have seen can appear either with or without objectagreement, there is evidence that the suffixed (ie., morphologically more complex)
versions are in some sense the ‘basic’ ones: they appear more frequently in texts
(approximately 70% of transitive verbs in texts use object agreement); they are the citation54Chapter 3forms of most transitive verbs; and, although all transitive clauses may appear with object
agreement, there are some transitive clauses that cannot appear without object agreement,
such as the verb molinga ‘remember’. Furthermore, there are many verbs (see chapter
4.3.3) that, if used transitively, require object agreement, and the limited data available to
me on child language acquisition suggests that children learning Tukang Besi acquire a
command of the object agreement earlier than they do of the subject prefixes. Children
often substitute the near-frozen ‘adjectival’ prefix mo- in the place of subject prefixes until
they are about 5 or 6 years old, but seem to be able to manipulate the object suffixes ontheir verbs much earlier, indicating that object indexing is learnt earlier than is subject
indexing.
3.4.3Passive clausesCompare these patterns with those found with a to- passive form (see chapter 11), in
which no by-phrase may be mentioned, and the single argument of the verb may be
indexed on the verb by means of subject prefixes, seen in (8):

frame:
waliako({Ag),({Thm/Pt]))‘return’This is different from the ambitransitive verbs that all require a nominative patient/theme,and allow for an optional agent; waliako has an agentive argument, and allows that
argument to act on itself, intransitively, or on another object, transitively. This contrasts
with the closely related verb mbule ‘return’, which is a simple agentive intransitive verb,
and does not allow for a transitive interpretation:mbule ({Ag]) ‘return’Word classes4.6105Closed word classesThe closed word classes show less internal division, less derivational morphology, and
much smaller membership than the open classes of noun, verb (and adjective). Some of
these, the independent forms of the pronouns, and the referential and actual
demonstratives, for instance, are better thought of as belonging to a greater nominal class,
but they are described here separately, due to their smaller membership and restricted
derivational possibilities.
4.6.1Personal pronounsPersonal pronouns are available for first, second and third persons, and further
differentiate number three ways for first person (singular, paucal and plural), and two
ways for second person (singular and plural). The paucal category is being eroded to
become a plural exclusive one, through contact with other languages, foremost Malay, that
use this distinction. The pronoun class can be thought of as having one set of free forms,two prefixed sets, and three suffixed sets (one of which is becoming obsolete). There are,
however, very few features distinguishing the free forms of the pronouns from any other
noun, and might be better thought of as being specialised nouns, leaving only the bound
forms as true pronouns. Further details on the forms of the various pronominal sets are
given in Chapter 5.
4.6.2Epistememes (interrogatives)Whilst there is clearly a group of words that may be called interrogatives, in that they are
invariably used when asking content questions and for specifying the semantic range of agroup of entities, the actual words themselves fall into different classes, and some are
indeed precategorial. Only a small few of the words can be classed as being epistememes
(see Durie and Mushin 1992, Mushin 1995 for a discussion about the use and justification
of this term), and do not belong in any other word class. The epistememes found in
Tukang Besi are:

In the case of the inalienable marker, the anaphoric marker, the previous reference
marker, and most genitive constructions, attribution of a head in the same phrase is the
only option. For non-animate genitive constructions (ie., possession of an inanimate) there
is the option of using the ‘dummy’ head-filler anu ‘thingy, whatsit’, and with oblique case
phrases an appositional phrase may be used to express the oblique relation of a non-headed
noun phrase, provided there is an overt nominative article emphasising the oblique phrase
reference. Appositional phrases are dealt with in more detail in section 12.4, but examples
illustrating their appearance with relative phrases are given below:

"OBLQemai?
who“Where is that big one of mine that I made?’Similarly, a numeral + classifier may not be followed by an adjective, but does allow a

Adjectives may be modified by almost the normal range of possible modifiers, but do
not allow for an adjective following, since that position allows maximally one member in
an NP, and is already occupied. In order for an adjective to modify another adjective, it
must be treated as a normal verb and appear in the relative clause position, as seen in (38):

"7.6Object suffixesMosttransitiveverbscanbe suffixedwithobjectsuffixes,andmanyintransitive(‘ambitransitive’) verbs too may occur with object suffixes (see chapter 4); these index the
direct object of the verb, and are portmanteau forms expressing the number and person of
the object. Their affect on the structure of the verbal complex is minimal, but they
drastically affect the distribution of the core case-marking articles (see chapter 3 for a
summary of this and other KP marking strategies). The use of object suffixes is also
largely dependent on discourse factors, namely givenness, specificity (rather tahn
definiteness), and topic continuity, much like the use of passive forms in English. In this
way, the object suffixes are the equivalent of passive forms in languages such as Englishas regards discourse functions (special thanks to C. Donohue for first pointing this
correspondence out to me in 1992), creating a new pivot of the sentence for certain
constructions. Compare (41) with sentence (42):

3R-flee* ‘The blacksmith saw the pirate, and so the pirate fled.’Both of these sentences show the preverbal KP of the first sentence coreferential with the
subject of the second, but in the case of (41) it is the object of the verb no‘ita’e, and not thesubject, that is judged to be coreferential with the elided KP in the second clause. The
subject prefixes on the verb, however, continue to index the person and number of naVerb phrases159tukatutu, showing that the subject remains a core argument. The grammatical status of
nominative arguments is examined in greater depth in chapter 20.
An important use of the object suffixes is when they are obligatorily used to indicate
that the [Theme/Patient] argument of an ambitransitive verb is the object, and not the
subject, of the clause. Unlike English, most otherwise intransitive verbs cannot be simply
used with an added object:

have variants in which the sister of the preposition is a case phrase, not an apparently bare

oblique, and both fe and na are core articles. Similarly, na and te cannot combine becausena marks nominative case, and te the non-nominative one. Combinations with the genitive

Attempting to explain the asymmetries found in table 28, we note that only [Theme] or
(Locative] applied objects allow indexing of an argument other than the by-phrase. In
terms of the thematic hierarchy, this is a contiguous group of semantic roles:
agent - dative - instrument - [theme/patient - locative]
Furthermore, the arguments that may be indexed are in both cases the arguments that are
higher on the thematic hierarchy. In terms of the individual argument structures, the
possibilities of possessive indexing may be modelled as in (77) and (78). In these andsubsequent diagrams modelling the behaviour of relative clauses the arrows indicate the
possible reference of the possessive suffix:(77)( [Agent], [Dative), [Theme] pL)(78)({Agent], [Theme], [Location], ppy)|;L__LHAn applicative object in [Dative] or [Instrumental] role is placed higher on the thematic
hierarchy than the base object, which is a [Theme/Patient] (in most cases; see examples
(81) - (85)). If we posit a rule stipulating that the possessive suffixing on a verb in a
relative clause headed by an applied object may index any subcategorised-for argument
bearing a higher semantic role than the applied object itself, we can account for the failure
of applied objects bearing these semantic roles to index theme or patient base object. This
is modelled in (79):384Chapter 15(79)({Agent], (Dative/Instrument],ppy, [Theme]))Li|s2
INThe data in table 29 concerning the details of object relative clauses headed by the base
object of an applicative construction can also be explained by the relative prominence of
arguments on the thematic hierarchy. A base object may head an object relative clause of
an applicative construction if and only if the applied object is higher than it on the thematic
hierarchy, or is locative. The possessive suffixes must index an argument higher on the
thematic hierarchy than the base object, but not an agent, unless the applied object is onethat could not be a core argument of a simple predicate (ie., locative). The models for
examples (73) and (74) are given as (73)' and (74)':(73)'<{Agent], [Instrument],

lower-ranked semantic role than the applied object can be explained in terms of theunavailability of a higher non-agent argument. An example of this is given in (80):(80)({Agent], [Agent] app., [Theme]}))—IThis still leaves the question of the behaviour of base objects in applicative
constructions which are in [Dative] or [Instrumental] role, when the applied object is also
either [Dative] or [Instrumental]. If we examine a verb which subcategorises for an
instrumental object, and then has a dative applicative object added, we find the followingpatterns of indexing in object relative clauses:

non-nominative ones, also occurs. In a passive construction, the (derived) subject of the

"4.3,Open word classesThere are two main classes of words in Tukang Besi that have open membership, nouns
and verbs. There is not a limit to the number of items in these classes, and loan words are
regularly assimilated to one of these open classes. Additionally, there is a sub-class of
verbs that has several distinct morphosyntactic properties, in some ways more similar to
nouns than to verbs, consisting wholly of intransitive non-agentive verbs (see 4.5); these
are called adjectives. They act identically to verbs when used predicatively, but whenmodifying the head of an NP they display some distinctive behaviour. The adjectives also
appear to be an open (sub-)class, with approximately 9% of the lexicon of the language
being adjectives (Based on a count of approximately 1500 items in a dictionary file), and
loanwords able to be borrowed into this class.
4.4NounsA noun can be identified on syntactic grounds by the fact that it always appears in an NP,
preceded by either an article (see 4.6.7) or a preposition (4.6.4). In citation, nouns are
most commonly preceded by the non-nominative core article te. A nominal can head an NP
without requiring any morphology to specify that it is serving in that role, such as the
derivational -‘a required on some ‘verbs’. Due to the extensive indexing of role
informationontheverbin TukangBesi,nominalsin corefunctionoccurratherWord classes91infrequently: a text of 130 verbal clauses (Wa Jambo, in the appendices) included
approximately 30 nominals each in [S] and [O] role, and 10 in [A] role. The infrequency of
nominals appearing in discourse, and the lack of any outstanding pre-syntactic criteria that
they have, leads to there being few criteria for their classification. The system of numeral
classifiers covertly divides the nominals into groups, but these are not absolute divisions,
as one nominal may appear with more than one classifier, such as loka ‘banana’ (see
4.6.6).","[116, 117]"

according to the form of the preposition and each of the semantic roles that are associated
with the preposition under discussion. In addition to a discussion of their prepositional
uses, each section also summarises the non-prepositional uses associated with that form.
12.11.1Alllative prepositionkuaThe allative preposition kua is used as well as the oblique article di/ to indicate direction
towards something (the core allative usage), but also has uses not encompassed by di/i. It
can be used to introduce direct and indirect speech (glossed in these cases simply as a
colon; see chapter 16), and can be used to mark the recipient in clauses involving
transactions, though this may be a calque on the Malay use of a variant of the allative
preposition in this role (ke(pada)). Indeed, the use of kua to mark the recipient is not
accepted by many speakers, who use i/di for this meaning.
When used allatively, kua differs from i/di in this use in that kua is used to specify a
direction, rather than a destination. Compare the question and answer sets provided in (98)
and (99):(98)a.","[352, 353]"
"4.7A note on ‘derivational’ and ‘inflectional’ categoriesAs with the distinction between different word classes, so too is the distinction between
derivational and inflectional morphology somewhat tenuous for Tukang Besi. This can beillustrated with the set of object suffixes. As would be expected of an inflectional class,
they are fully productive; any transitive verb may (optionally) take object suffixes, and
some verbs require them. The existence of such pairs as ja‘o ‘bad’ and ja'oke ‘ruin’(morphologically decomposable into the adjective ‘bad’ + the affix ’third person object
suffix’), exemplified in 4.5, example (62), might be taken as proof that the set of object
suffixes can function as a means of deriving transitive verbs from intransitive ones. This
view would assume that the presence or absence of object-indexing morphology on the
verb dictated the article choice on the KP; in fact, as the choice of articles on the KPs isreally a case-marking system that makes overt a pragmatic prominence due to the role that
the argument in question plays in the discourse situation, it is better to think of the abstract
Case ‘nominative’ being assigned to the KP on the base of discourse criteria (given,
prominent information, ongoing salience in the narration or conversation). Should that
argument not be the highest on the hierarchy of semantic roles that the main verb of its
clause subcategorises for, then the verb must be marked by object suffixes. Since some
verbs, such as ja’o ‘bad; ruin’ have a stipulation in their lexical entries that the nominative
argument must be the [Patient], these verbs must use object suffixes when they are
presented with a nominal argument serving as an [O].",[138]
"Discussingtheimportance of verbal indexing in head marking languages, in which class Tukang Besi is at
least partly included (the fact that the object is only optionally indexed on the verb in
Tukang Besi makes it a less than perfect exemplar of the class), Van Valin (1993: 17-18)writes that
...with respect to clauses in head-marking languages, the pronominal affixes
on the verb are the core arguments of the clause, not the optional
independent lexical NPs and pronouns....What then is their [the independent
NPs - MHD] status? Semantically, their function is to further specify the
reference of the pronominal arguments, which specify only person (and
sometimes number). Syntactically, they are clause internal...they are irrelevant
to statements of grammatical phenomena, because these phenomena make
reference primarily to the pronominal affixes.
(emphasis original)
In Foley’s (1991) description of Yimas, he asserts that the pronominal affixes in that
language are pronominal elements. He states that
In essence, the claim is that the pronominal affixes actually fill the argumentpositions of the verb and that any noun phrases filling what seem to be the core
argument positions of the verb are actually only indirectly linked to it, by being
in apposition to a pronominal affix which bears the same noun class, person,
and number specifications as the noun phrase.
(p. 227-228)124Chapter 5The arguments that he puts forward in favour of this interpretation in Yimas are also valid
arguments for treating the pronominal affixes in Tukang Besi as filling the argument
positions of a verb (at least some of the time). These arguments are:1. Overt nominals are often not used in discourse, referents mentioned solely by
means of their pronominal affixes
2.(p. 229-230);Pronominal affixes referring to nominals distinguish more number categories
than do the nominal themselves(p. 230-231);3.","[149, 150]"

"In (18) tawatawa functions as the head of a noun phrase, its nominal character in thisclause clear from the article preceding it indicating that it is in a KP, and is the nominative
subject of the intransitive verb nduu ‘make noise’; tawatawa is not affixed to indicate
relative clause status, so we must assume it is the nominal head of the NP. In the next line,given here as (19), tawatawa is prefixed with verbal subject-marking morphology, and
clearly serves as the intransitive verb in the clause whose subject is te ndongandonga ‘the
clanger’ / ‘the clanging one’. Similar precategorial behaviour is found with words
describing more permanent properties, such as leama ‘good’, which may function as a
predicate (Noleama, ‘S/he’s good.’), or a referential expression in a KP (te leama, ‘the
good (one)’, or the good(ness)’; the KP may refer either to someone or something
possessing this property, or to the property itself). With an adjective beginning with mo-,
such as molengo ‘long (time)’, the use of the lexeme in a KP requires less morphology
than the predicative use, since the fossilised mo- prefix is not retained in referential use:
te lengo, ‘the long (one)’, or the length’, compared with Nomopera ‘S/he’s short.’, but
* Nolengo. With adjectives with the fossilised ma-, the prefix is always retained when
referential (te mamuda ‘the comfortable (one)’/’the comfort’), and adjectives with me-show variable behaviour: te langka / te melangka ‘the long (one)’ / the length’, and
Nomelangka.
There do not appear to be many Jexemes that are always unambiguously either nounsWord classes87or verbs, but not both. Certainly (at least most) ‘nominals’ can occur in verbal positions,

young.girlOn the other hand, there are no transitive verbs that CANNOT take object suffixes. If there
is an unmarked category, then, it is that which uses the object suffixes. This is a counter tothe intuitive claim (based on morphological evidence) that the basic form of the verb is the
verb without object suffixes; since the putative category for non-object focus, a verb
without object suffixes, has less morphological complexity than a verb with object
suffixes, it is thus less markedthan the suffixed version (as illustrated in (55) andelsewhere). That is, the morphological realisations of the two categories are as follows:
non-object ‘focus’
°%)object ‘focus’
-aku, -ko, -'e, -ke, -ne, -kami, -kita, -komiu(-ke and -ne are variants of the third person suffix)
Other tests of markedness, such as the fact that some transitive verbs require the presence
of the object suffixes, whereas none require them to be absent, are indicative of the fact
that they are unmarked. Further argumentation on this point has already been presented in
chapter 3. Chapter 20, drawing on Sells 1995b, presents a more detailed analysis of the
function of voice and case in both Tukang Besi and a better-known Philippine language,
Tagalog, and argues that the apparent inflectional categories of the object suffixes are not
incompatible with the analysis that they monitor a Philippine-style voice system.
7.6.2Object suffixes: a third accountAn alternative analysis of the voice system would be to assume that the sentences in (47b)
represent the basic clause structure, and that na and te are absolutive and ergative case
markers, respectively (see the model in 3.4.1). Sentences such as (47a) are then derivedfrom them; this would then be an antipassive construction. A reglossing of (47a) and
(47b), with the intransitive sentence (2) from chapter 3, would be as seen in (55) and (56):

exemplified in the preceding sections, can be summarised as follows:PIVOT RESTRICTED TO:GRAMMATICAL[NOM]Floating quantifiers

thus not germane to the discussion of alignment in a particular language (see Manning1995 for discussion of which sorts of grammatical constructions fit into this category),
there is still a bewildering array of grammatical pivots shown in the summary above.
We can make more sense out of this apparent confusion by an examination of the terms
and categories involved. The core semantic roles of [Agent], [Dative], [Instrument],
(Theme/Patient] have been established by reference to the facts concerning causatives and
applicatives (see chapters 9 and 10). Further restrictions on accessibility to variousgrammatical processes that are dependent on an argument bearing [Agent], [Instrument] or
[Theme/Patient] role have been presented and summarised in this chapter. Reference to this
thematic hierarchy and the semantic role that an argument bears is thus established as
essential to a description of grammatical processes in Tukang Besi. The other terms used,
the syntactic roles ({A], [S] and [O}) and the pragmatic roles ([NOM] and [- NOM)) willnow be examined to determine their function in the description.
20.13.1The category [A]The [A) syntactic role, as defined in chapter 3, is a category that is filled by the [Agent]argument of a transitive verb that subcategorises for such an argument in all cases. In
Tukang Besi, it sometimes includes a [Dative] or [Instrument] argument of a transitive verb
if that is the most prominent argument (as defined in chapter 3). For example, with hoti‘donate’, the [Dative] argument is not an [A], but with tarima ‘receive’ it is, as defined by,
for instance, the ability of that argument to head a subject relative clause:482Chapter 20
(124)* Temiah[{um]oti...","[506, 507, 508]"
"1SG-askCOREwomanOBL _verandayon‘Tl ask that woman on the veranda.’The restrictions on the positions in a verbal clause in which an oblique phrase may
appear have already been described in chapter 3, and amount to a restriction against any
non-core arguments appearing within the VP, regardless of their status as prepositional
phrases or oblique case phrases.
Despite being able to appear as adjuncts, predicates or modifiers, there are differences324 Chapter 12
in the range of interpretation that can be attributed to the different oblique markers in these
different usages, and restrictions on which functions the different oblique markers may fill.
For instance, i/di may be used as a marker of static location, as in (73) - (75), but may also
serve to mark the goal (allative location, recipient), and in some cases the source of
movement. The variation of semantic range and function that the different oblique markersexhibit is summarised in table 25:

"Whilst the third person shows no distinction in number, and the second person
differentiates between singular and non-singular, there are two pronominal sets
corresponding to the first person non-singular, ikami and ikita, glossed as “1PA”
(paucal) and “iPL” (plural) respectively. These pronouns are used with a lot of overlap
by most speakers, but the ikami forms usually refer to a small group of people,
typically two to four, and the ikita forms typically refer to groups of four or more,
though they have been heard with reference to as few as two people. Note that the
fundamental difference between the two is NOT one of exclusive/inclusive as is usually
the case in Austronesian languages (at least as far as the speech of older, more
traditional speakers is concerned), but of ‘paucal’ versus ‘plural’ reference. An
example of this is (1), overheard in a canoe:

typically deals with such concepts as ownership, kin and social relationships; body parts
and part/whole relationships are not dealt with in detail, and it cannot really be argued that
locational clauses represent a kind of possessive relationship; they are dealt with in
Chapter 15.
Ownership can be expressed with the verb hoto-. This takes the object of possession as
its obligatorily incorporated predicate, and the possessor is expressed by means of subject
prefixes. The incorporated nature of the object is evident by the lack of an article before the
nominal following the verb, and the possibility for aspectual marking to follow the nominal
(see chapter 7 for details of VP-internal structure). Verbs unmarked by object suffixesnormally mark their objects with the non-nominative core article te, but this is not an
acceptable paraphrase for the object of hoto-: * Ku-hoto te wunua to'oge. The verb jari
‘become’ is another verb that often appears with an incorporated nominal, but in the case
of jari a paraphrase with a non-incorporated nominal is also possible, which is not the case
with hoto- unless that nominal is nominative.
This construction is most commonly used with third person possessors, though that is
by no means a restriction on the grammaticality of a sentence.

"The modified hierarchy referred to in this grammar is as follows, collapsing Bresnan and
Kanerva’s beneficiary, goal and experiencer into one position, here labelled ‘dative’ (since
it covers a lot of the ground occupied by traditional dative cases), and recognising that on
morphosyntactic grounds we cannot distinguish theme and patient, thus collapsing them
into ‘theme/patient’ (various other languages, notably those of the Caucasus and of
Polynesia, clearly do distinguish theme from patient. See Kibrik (1985), Chung (1978),
amongst others):
agent > dative > instrument > theme/patient > locative
Various parts of grammar refer to the role that arguments bear on this hierarchy, and
the relative order of the different semantic roles in this hierarchy is also particularly useful
in explaining some facts of object relative clauses (chapter 15). Conventions that need to beintroduced with respect to the use of argument structure and semantic roles are the use of
empty square brackets ‘[ ]’ to refer to an argument whose semantic role value is notspecified or irrelevant to the discussion at hand, and the use of angled brackets ‘( )’ to
represent the list of arguments in a verbs subcategorisation frame. If a verb subcategorisesfor oblique arguments, then they are represented in a separate list: ((CORE))
((OBLIQUE)). An example of this is one of the argument list for the verb kahu ‘send’:‘send ([Agent] [Theme]) ([Recipient])’.",[76]
