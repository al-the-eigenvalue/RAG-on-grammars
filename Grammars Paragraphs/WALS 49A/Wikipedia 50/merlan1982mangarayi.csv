Case functions
are marked in nouns by combinations of prefixes and suffixes.
This is
unlike the majority of better-known (mostly Pama-Nyungan) Australian
languages in which case functions tend to be marked by suffixes only.
The
marking of case is formally intertwined with marking for noun class, as
described in 2.1.1a.
The description of case-marking is complicated by the fact that all
overt number suffixes have distinct case forms.
Discussion is limited first
to the singular noun; in 2.1.1.8 the number suffixes are introduced.
221.1a:_Noun_classeesi_syntactic casepatterningThere are three noun classes: masculine, feminine and neuter.
Masculine and neuter classes are inflectionally similar in a number of ways,
including the fact that each class has two prefix forms, each prefix
appropriate to a particular set of case functions.
(See comments below on
a third masculine prefix form.)
In the distribution of forms over syntactic case functions, masculine
and feminine nouns pattern nominative-accusatively, while neuter nouns
pattern ergative-absolutively.
The distribution of forms over clause functions is shown in the following chart (TS = transitive subject function,

Nominal case function is indicated by noun class/case markers which show different patterning by noun

There are three noun classes, masculine,

(largely inanimate).
Case-marking in masculine and feminine classes is
organized nominative-accusatively, and in the neuter class, ergative-absolutively.
Also pronouns, demonstratives,
interrogative-indefinite and plural

There is evidence, however,

nominative-accusative patterning in at least the feminine noun class is
a historical development from an earlier ergative-absolutive pattern (see

"Because the burden of maintaining participant co-reference is borne
by the cross-referencing pronominals, independent pronouns tend to be infrequent in most contexts.
With reference to such languages, it is sometimes
said that the occurrence of pronouns is purely 'emphatic' or 'stylistic'.

"NasalgradeofmorphemesSome pronouns, interrogative-indefinite forms, nominals and directionals exhibit nasal grades before some or all suffixes.
Occurrence of
nasal grades of morphs creates environments for the application of P-2.
The forms in question have zero grades which may be word-final, and nasal
grades which can be word-final for some, but for all occur before some nonzero suffixes.
Statement of the allomorphy in terms of grade alternations
appears most satisfactory;
the alternative would be to postulate nasal
insertion where necessary,
However, since not all morphemes which could
show a contrast between zero and nasal-grade forms actually do so, it seems
preferable to represent the alternation between them as a morphological
fact about those that do, rather than as a phonological rule of nasal210

insertion.
The examples in (a)-(f) below show zero versus nasal-grade
alternations.
(a)
Possessive suffixes and independent genitive pronouns
See the list of possessive suffixes in 2.1.2.4.1.
These may be
suffixed for dative-purposive and local cases.
With any non-zero case
ending, the nasal grade of the suffixes is required.
Compare:banam-nanju‘mysingular object marker -nan, and nasal grade

See Tables 2-2 and 2-3.
The plural number suffixes have no nasal grade.

All.
Most of the independent genitive pronouns
(see 2.1.2.1.10) are built
by suffixation of case ending /w,u/ to the nasal grade of possessive suffixes,
with concomitant hardening of the suffix to -gu; e.g., lExDu possessive
suffix -nira, genitive pronoun niran-gu.
Exceptions to this pattern are:
1Sg genitive pronoun is nanju-gu rather than expected *nanjunq-gu; 28g
genitive fhagan-gu shows nasal grade but is not built directlyon the possessive suffix -nanga; the third singular genitive pronouns are na-nan-gu

suffixes -nawu and -nayawu, respectively.
The independent genitive pronouns take case suffixes but do not themselves show a secondary nasal
grade; e.g., allative Nanjugu-{ama
'to me, mine’, not *nanjugun-galama.
The nasal grade of possessive suffixes is also required before most
number suffixes, but not before those used with kinship terms (2.1.1.8.6.

Verb complexes are of three
types.
First, the most common construction type consists of free, uninflected particle expressing most of the verb's lexical meaning, combined with
one of a number of semantically fairly empty separable auxiliaries which
serve as prop for inflectional affixes, e.g., buy? wu- 'to show'.
Second,
‘compound’ verbs consist of an initial (usually unanalyzable)
compounding
element followed by an inseparable auxiliary.
The inseparable auxiliaries
are a subset of the separable ones of particle plus auxiliary constructions.
An example of the compound type is barafitbu- 'to dream'.
Finally, there
are morphologically simple verb roots which can function by themselves with
full lexical meaning, such as gawa- 'dig, bury’ or bu- 'hit'.
Some of
these, especially CV roots like bu-, are identical to separable and inseparable auxiliaries found in the other two construction types.
Cross-referencing pronominal prefixes are obligatory in the verb.
There
are two sets of cross-referencing pronominals, subjective and objective.
In the distribution of these case forms over functions, the pronominals
pattern nominative-accusatively.

constructions.

"MorphologyManarayi, like the other languages in its genetic subgroup, is characterized by relatively complex inflectional morphology of its nominals
(nouns
and adjectives), pronouns, demonstratives and inflecting verbs.
Morphological structures mark the categories appropriate to each word class (such as

indication of grammatical relations among sentence constituents.
There are
almost no syntactic processes by which sentences may be related to each
other as transforms; for example, the active-passive relation is entirely
lacking.
Processes of sentence embedding are minimal.
Derivational processes which derive one word class from another (such as nominalization of
verbs, or verbalization of nouns and adjectives) are relatively restricted,
and even where such processes can correctly be used to produce transforms
of other sentence types, textual analysis shows that limited syntactic use
is made of them.

causatives, is almost non-existent; exceptions to this are the intransitivization of inflecting verbs to form reflexives and reciprocals, and formation of inchoatives.
The need for verbal derivatives such as causatives
is taken care of by use of different auxiliaries with the same verb particle
(see 2.1.3.1.2.1).
Manarayi is a highly inflecting language; the principal grammatical
processes are prefixation and suffixation.
There is some reduplication of
nouns, generally to express plurality, but this is not extensive.
Reduplication of verbs is occasionally found to express increased intensity or
repetition of action, but is not used to distinguish tenses or other paradigmatic forms of the verb as in some neighboring languages

the same X referred to in preceding speech', though the noun with which the
anaphor occurs may be different from the word, or other means (e.g., pronominal prefix) originally used to establish that participant in the
discourse.
There is no element besides the anaphoric prefix that has only the
function of indicating that some item is specific and identifiable,
The
noun class/case prefixation system cannot serve this purpose very consistently, because it principally marks grammatical distinctions of a different
order.
However,
there seems to be some interaction between prefixation and
specification of identifiability.
It was observed
(2.1.1.4.13)
that the noun gadugu, when used as a
generic purposive,
is marked with the masculine/neuter prefix form na- and
suffix -wu; a specific,
feminine class noun would be marked with naya-.
More importantly,
it has been noted that nouns explicitly marked
for nonsingularity tend not to be prefixed for class/case.
One reason for
this is that many nonsingulars refer to mixed-gender sets, and thus the
masculine-feminine contrast is of more limited applicability,
But another
reason is that the signalling of definiteness for semantically nonsingular
nouns seems to be more closely linked to number-marking than to any other
functional system.
The fact that a noun ts number-marked indicates that
it is referentially specific, a situation that renders overt noun class
marking redundant.
It was observed earlier
(2.1.1.8.2.-3)
that semanticallypluralbutnon-specificnouns—thatis,thosewhichrefertoitemsnot identifiable from either situation or linguistic context — are usually
morphologically singular, and are usually also cross-referenced as singular
in the verb.
On the other hand, identifiability of participants is linked
to and partly expressed by more consistent overt number specification of
nouns, and corresponding nonsingular cross-reference in the verb.
The
noun, in fact, often does not serve to establish participants in discourse
and narrative.
