The noun phrase is defined as the structural unit that can occur as the subject (241a),

1.2.4.1. Operational definition for the prepositional phrase
The prepositional phrase is defined mainly in terms of its internal composition: the head,
consisting of an inflected form of the single 'ON preposition (see 2.1.5), followed by an
optional nominal element, composed of an NP (238a–c), noun clause (238d), or derived
noun (238e). The first or second person inflection of the preposition appears alone, i.e. noSyntax143nominal element may follow it (238f). The prepositional phrase is further defined by its
syntactic function as an object-like argument to the verb—see 1.2.1.2.3–4.

1.16.1. Noun
Nouns may be distinguished by the following morphological criteria: (i) they may bear
possessive suffixes or NICS—see 2.1.1.4.6; and (ii) they may be followed by any one of
the spatial/temporal demonstratives—see 1.2.5.2.5 (note that only two of the
demonstratives, ca' ‘this (neuter) proximate to speaker’ and ma' ‘that proximate to
hearer’, and one of the temporal demonstratives, cara ‘absent’, though without its
accompanying temporal particle, may follow a verb). Besides these morphological
characteristics, the following syntactic criteria apply to nouns: (iii) they may appear alone
as subject or object of the verb, (iv) they may appear as the complement of a form of the
preposition—see 1.2.4; and (v) they may occur in sequence with another noun in a
possessed NP, in which the second element (possessor) can be any noun except a derived
noun, and the first NP is marked by the possessive marking suffixes or NICS referred to
above (functioning semantically as either an actually possessed element or a nominal
modifier—see 1.2.5.2.3).
1.16.2. Pronoun
There are two classes of pronouns: (1) demonstrative and (2) emphatic.
(1) The demonstrative pronoun is a subclass of nouns. It satisfies three of the syntactic
criteria that define the noun: (i) it may appear by itself as the subject or object of the verb;Wari'216(ii) it may appear by itself as the complement of a form of the preposition; and (iii) it may
appear as the second element (possessor) of a possessed NP. It is different from
nonpronominal nouns, however, in that it cannot be suffixed or postposed by an NIC or
possessive marking suffix, nor can it be followed by a demonstrative.
(2) The emphatic pronoun is not a subclass of nouns. It cannot occur by itself as the
subject or object of the verb, nor can it appear as the complement of a form of the
preposition. It is marked by its potential to occur alone (in the case of first and second
person) or in apposition to a noun or demonstrative pronoun (in the case of third person)
in coordinate constructions (see 1.3.3) or to express emphasis (see 1.11.2.1.3).
1.16.3. Verb
The verb is the main predicate constituent of all major sentence types. It is marked by the
following morphological criteria: (i) its potential to be compounded with a verbal
modifier or with another verb; and (ii) that it may be followed by verbal inflectional
clitics. There are two additional subclasses of verbs, which we label verbal modifiers.
These are like main verbs, except they may only occur in compounded verbs (see 1.16.7).
There are usually slight semantic differences in the meanings of verbs when compounded
in nonhead position.
1.16.4. Nominal modifier
Nominal modifiers do not occur as a separate word class. See 1.16.1.
1.16.5. Preposition
The preposition is marked by its function as the head of the prepositional phrase, which
may occur as any nonsubject argument of the verb. It can occur alone (inflected for the
person, number and gender of its object) or with a complement, which may be a simple
noun or derived noun—see 1.2.4.","[228, 229]"

There is no distinction between singular and plural marking on nouns.

See 2.1.1.8.3.
2.1.1.8.2. Optionality of number marking systems in nouns
See 2.1.1.8.3.
2.1.1.8.3. Other means of indicating number
Although there are no obligatory number distinctions on nouns, there are four ways
(optionally) to mark number on them.
(1) There is a set of collective markers or particles that can precede nouns to express
the general notion of plurality. 'Oro is the most common. It can appear optionally with all
common nouns, even on collective nouns (546d).
(546) a.'oropanacolltree‘trees’
(546) b.'orowari'collpersonMorphology283‘people’
(546) c.'oroxirixi'
xiri-xi'collhouse-1pincl‘our (incl) house’
(546) d.'orohwijima'collchildren‘all the children’There are four other collective particles that have a limited, complementary distribution.
They indicate a specific group. Waram can occur with the first person singular inflection
of kinship terms, as in waram te ‘my fathers’; mon occurs with the word tarama’ ‘man’;
oromon occurs with the words xojam' ‘young girl’ and horon ‘old person’; and mana can
occur with the second and third person singular and plural inflections of co-kinship terms,
as well as some common nouns. See (547) below, where the use of mana with common
nouns illustrates the difference between 'oro as a general plural marker and the other
collective particles as specific group markers. Although 'oro and mana may appear with
the same noun, 'oro does not appear together with waram, mon, or 'oromon with the same
nouns—see 1.2.5.2.6.
(547) a.'orotocwecollBrazil:nut‘Brazil nut trees’
(547) b.manatocwetryBrazil:nut‘grove of Brazil nut trees’(2) Although the number of nouns referring to humans is also marked in the verbal
inflectional clitics (548a), possessive morphemes (548b) or on an inflected preposition
(548c), this device is very restricted, because only human nouns can be marked this way
(compare (548d) and (548e)), and they are also normally marked by other means—see
2.1.1.8.3(1, 3–5). See 2.1.1.8.3(4) on how to mark the number of nonhuman nouns.

semantically. See 2.1.1.9.3 for the significance of this class division.
2.1.1.9.3. Marking of noun classes
Gender is not marked on the noun itself, but on the verbal inflectional clitic (561a–c), in
the possessive suffix (562a–c) or nominal inflectional clitic (562d–f), or by the
demonstrative following the noun (563a–c). In the latter case, a distinction is only made
between neuter versus nonneuter, i.e. the masculine and feminine distinction is
neutralized. In these cases, agreement with the gender of the noun is obligatory. Verbal
inflectional clitics are described in 2.1.3.6; genitives in 1.10; and demonstratives in
1.2.5.2.5.

"'Antake:s'inonxocoricon'ina-onxocori-con1s:rp/p-3smnewness-3sm‘I got a new dress’.wom.cottonWari'334In all other cases, there is a distinction between predicative and attributive forms of
modification as follows:
(1) In -xi' nouns, the first person singular form functions as the complement to a
copula (predicative), whereas attributive modification is expressed by the third person
inflection.
(645) a.","[346, 347]"
"An overview of 'oro nao' grammar3Thus, Chapacuran is one of the rare language families in the Amazon which manifests
grammatical gender distinctions, the other families being Arawan and Arawakan.
However, contra Greenberg (1987), these families are not related, at least they share no
obvious cognates and the presence of gender is hardly a sufficiently reliable criterion
alone to posit any genetic affiliation (see Everett 1996).
Like many languages with rich agreement, in 'ON nouns usually only appear in
sentences to signal particular discourse functions and in isolated sentences to avoid
ambiguity. Otherwise, it is more common merely to reference participants in a
predication via VICS, NICS, or the inflected preposition wherever possible.
(Nonpronominal) nouns are not themselves marked for case, number, person or
gender. These features are discernible via agreement and certain verbal modificational
forms. There are two broad classes of nouns, -xi' nouns (so-called because their citation
form ends in -xi' 1pincl) and non-xi' nouns. Kinship terms form a third (closed), minor
class. Both -xi' nouns and kinship terms are inalienably possessed. The non-xi' nouns for
the most part all have -xi' forms as well. The non-xi' forms are themselves subdivided
into nonpossessable and possessable nouns. Non-xi' forms which may not be possessed
(although if they have a -xi' form they may be possessed in that form) are body parts,
exclusively. Optionally possessable non-xi' forms can be marked as possessed via NICS.
The distinction between -xi' vs non-xi' nouns is also important for the derivational
morphology since non-xi' nouns when zero-derived to form verbs usually form
attributive, nonactive verbs, whereas verbs zero-derived from -xi' nouns are almost
always active.
Although case is not overtly marked on nouns, the verbal inflectional clitic is sensitive
to the semantic role that the noun phrase bears in the clause, rigidly observing the
following hierarchy for object agreement (subject agreement is always obligatory,
regardless of the semantic role of the subject):
(c) GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>
LOCATION>TIMEThat is, if there is a GOAL in the clause, the object portion of the VIC must agree with it
(if there is also a theme, it is usually expressed as the object of the preposition, much as
Relational Grammar’s ‘3→2 Advancement’ would predict); if there is a circumstance
(but no goal) then it will be referenced on the VIC, and so on down the hierarchy, with
remaining roles usually expressed as prepositional objects.
0.2.3. Verbs
The class of verbs is the most productive word class in the language. Most adjectival
notions, as well as traditionally verbal meanings, are expressed as verbs. The majority of
loan words, regardless of the word class in the source language, enter Wari' as verbs.
Verbs may be either transitive, intransitive or ambitransitive, although the last class is
quite small. The last class, as one might expect, subdivides those where the intransitive
subject corresponds to the transitive object from those where the transitive subject
corresponds to the intransitive subject, with the verb for ‘turn over’ representing the first
class and the verb for ‘break’ the second class (e.g. ‘I turned over the baby’ vs ‘The baby
turned over’; ‘The man broke his arm’ vs ‘The man broke’). Perhaps the most remarkableWari'4fact about verbs in 'ON is the almost complete absence of verbal inflectional processes
alongside a rich set of derivational processes. Nouns, emphatic pronouns and sentences
may all form verbs via zero-derivation. Any verb, whether nonderived or derived
(including ‘desententialized’ verbs, i.e. verbs derived from sentences), may be
compounded to form new verbs or to increase transitivity. Verb compounding never
reduces the transitivity of the verb as a whole, which is set by the leftmost member of the
compound, which we analyse as the head of the compound.
There are two minor classes of verbs which we have labelled preverbal and postverbal
modifiers. These differ from main verbs in two ways, according to our analysis: (i) they
may never occur in the predicate outside of a compound; and (ii) some of the preverbal
modifiers may also modify nouns, in prehead position within the NP. Verbal compounds
are always constructed according to the following template (superscripts indicate number
of times a category can reoccur in a single sequence. No superscript means that there is
no reoccurrence allowed):
(d)preverbal modifier effect2 postverbal modifier2 initial action/cause resultEach effect/result is produced by the action of the verb (in its compound) to its immediate
left, suggesting an iconic principle of compound formation.
Verbs are uninflected by affixation, except for reduplication, which marks aspect.
There are various types of reduplication processes. One interesting aspect of
reduplication is that an inflectional (INFL) morpheme otherwise expected in a particular
clause will sometimes not co-occur with reduplication.
Aside from compounding, zero-derivation and reduplication, verb morphology in 'ON
is quite simple. Certainly it is one of the simplest morphological systems in Lowland
Amazonia. Nevertheless, this simplicity is deceptive since this language provides perhaps
the strongest evidence yet documented on the ability of the syntax to feed wordformation, in violation of certain theoretical proposals and frameworks, such as Lexical
Phonology.
Valency-reducing morphology is represented on the VIC, with special forms for
active, passive, and reflexive. But since VICS are not part of the verb word, these
inflectional processes are actually independent of the verb per se.
0.2.4. Preposition
'ON has a single preposition, obligatorily inflected for person, number and gender of its
object. It is required for definite NPS not referenced on the VIC, as per the hierarchy
given in (c) above, although it is optional for indefinite NPS, without regard to the
semantic role of the NP, subject only to the condition that it only appear with NPS not
referenced on the VIC.
0.2.5. Emphatic pronouns
There are emphatic pronouns for all grammatical person, number, and gender
combinations. These can only be used as zero-derived verbs, in left-dislocation position,
and as arguments of the verb, in which case they must be followed immediately by an
appositional noun further specifying their referent (usually a proper noun). First andAn overview of 'oro nao' grammar5second person emphatic pronouns may only be used as replies to questions or as
exclamations, in left-dislocated position, and in certain kinds of list structures. The first
person plural inclusive emphatic pronoun is wari', the autodenomination of the people.
Interestingly, there are no simple personal pronouns in the language. Personal pronoun
functions are expressed via demonstratives.
0.2.6. Demonstratives and personal pronouns
First and second persons can only be expressed on VICS, NICS and emphatic pronouns.
There are no simple or derived pronominal forms for first or second person. Personal
pronouns for third person are derived from demonstratives. The semantic categories
encoded in demonstratives are proximity to speaker vs proximity to hearer vs distal,
singular+gender, and plural (in which no gender is expressed), as well as a small range of
temporal categories as well. These may occur as arguments in NP positions within the
clause and they may be used for noncontrastive emphasis or even in apposition to
emphatic pronouns.
0.2.7. Verbal and nominal inflectional clitics
0.2.7.1. Nominal inflectional clitics (NICS)
NICS follow possessed non-xi' nouns to indicate person, number and (third person)
gender of the possessor, and they may replace VICS in some types of nominalized
clauses. We have analysed them as clitics, rather than suffixes, primarily on phonological
grounds: (i) they never bear primary stress (which otherwise goes on the last syllable of
the noun preceding them); and (ii) they fail to undergo vowel harmony (or trigger it) with
the noun to which they attach.
0.2.7.2. Verbal inflectional clitics (VICS)
VICS always express person, number and gender (for third person) of the subject and
‘primary’ object (according to the semantic role hierarchy in (c) above). They also
express tense when the verb is clause-initial, except when tense is prohibited by a
particular postverbal modifier. The VIC is a (simple) clitic. As with NICS, VICS fail to
undergo vowel harmony with the word immediately preceding them, in this case the verb,
and they never bear primary stress. Unlike NICS, however, they can appear alone in
certain types of question responses and discourse circumstances (which certainly argues
against affixal status for them). We analyse each of the two parts of the VIC (subject and
object agreements) as affixes, at least prosodically:
(e)[VIC subject agreement-object agreement]The two parts of the VIC are stressed as a single word (stress on the last syllable) and
vowel harmony may take the entire VIC in its scope, but is otherwise allowed only within
words, VICS almost always form a single pause or breath group with the verb. By
labelling the VIC as a simple clitic (as per Zwicky 1977; see also Everett 1996), we claimWari'6that the VIC is in fact a grammatical word, but phonologically dependent, in this case
part of the preceding pause or breath group. Although rhythmically it seems to be part of
the preceding verb, intonation always falls sharply immediately before the VIC.
VICS may also manifest tense, but only when the VIC is in second position in its
clause. This is a result of the fact that tense in 'ON must occur in sentence second
position; see below.","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

1.2.1.2.3.1. Indirect object When more than one object-like argument occurs in the
sentence, the object referenced in the VIC will be the highest on the hierarchy: indirect
object (goal/circumstance)>direct object (theme/patient)>oblique object (although an
indirect and oblique object rarely occur in the same sentence). We will use the labels
indirect object, direct object and oblique object to refer to grammatical relations borne by
goal, theme/patient and oblique arguments in English (or ‘underlying grammatical
relations’). The object VIC is always required with definite objects, but optional with
indefinite objects, as discussed in 1.2.5.2.4. Thus a definite indirect object will always be
marked on the VIC. If there is no indirect object, the direct object can be marked on theWari'120VIC. If neither of these two occur, the oblique object may be referenced by the VIC. In
the extremely rare cases where more than one oblique object occurs, we have noticed the
following preference for marking on the VIC: location>time (see 2.1.1.4.3 and 2.1.1.4.4
for a discussion of instrumental and comitative roles; we will simply say here that
instrumental and comitative cannot cooccur). Objects not referenced by the VIC will be
marked by an appropriate form of the preposition (except in the cases discussed in
1.2.5.2.4). All NP arguments are optional when referenced by an agreement morpheme.

na-pa'press:downupon3s:rp/p-1s‘He feels sorry for (lit. presses down upon) me.’Such semantic drift is expected under a compounding analysis, but not under a
suffixation nor a serial verb analysis.
Phonologically, a string of independent words would receive stress on each word in
the string. In the verbs above, however, this is not the case. Primary stress is placed only
on the final verb of the string (with the verbs to the left receiving very light secondary
stresses at most). If these form a single compound verb (or affixed verb), this is to be
expected. It is harder to account for by a serial verb analysis. (At least it is less
economical, since we need compounding already to handle semantically opaque cases
like those in (737), and the ‘serial verb’ construction would be formally identical.)
Syntactically, the verbs in a serial verb construction should share the same subject.
That is not the case here, however, if we merely take the literal meaning of each verb:
(738)Querecquerecmao'inon
'ina-oncawijipane.seeseego:s1s:rp/p-3smson:1srem:past‘I saw my son off long ago.’ (lit. ‘I saw-went my son long ago.’)This sentence can be uttered even when the speaker (the subject referenced on the VIC)
does not go anywhere. It is the son that is doing the going in (738), not the speaker. At
the same time, however, the speaker is not causing the son to go, so a simple causative
analysis would miss the mark. A compound analysis can handle this by assuming that the
second verb is the result or object of the first, forming a single complex event of seeing
and going of which the subject is the ‘seer’ (because as leftmost verb, ‘see’ will be the
head of the compound and thus determine the subject of the verb, while the subject of
‘go’, the son, will be the object of the compound verb). In other words, while this has the
superficial form of a causative, it is in fact a new, compound verb. Consider the case of a
plural object:

"'Omcamaoca.not:existINFL:nrp/pgo:s3sm‘He didn’t go.’Even when overtly expressed, the subject is almost always also marked in the VIC (but

be used. The ra form only occurs in the sentence-final position. When one of the
variations is used, it either occurs sentence-final, or, if there is an expressed subject of the

Morphology
2.1. INFLECTION
2.1.1. Noun inflection
Aside from the marking discussed under 2.1.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.1.3, there are no other ways,
other than in kinship terms (see 2.2.2.2.1.5), for directly marking noun functions on the
noun. But in what follows, we indicate how the different functions are expressed.
2.1.1.1. Means by which the syntactic and semantic functions of noun
phrases are expressed
2.1.1.1.1. Bound affixes
Bound affixes consist of (1) a set of possessive suffixes, which mark the person, number,
and third person gender of the possessor on -xi' nouns-see 2.1.1.4.6; and (2) a prefix, co-,
which marks the derivational process whereby certain kinship terms are formed—see
2.2.2.2.1.5.
2.1.1.1.2. Morphophonemic alterations
Internal morphophonemic alterations to express syntactic and semantic functions in the
noun phrase do not occur.
2.1.1.1.3. Nominal inflectional clitics
A set of possessive nominal inflectional clitics mark person, number, and third person
gender of the possessor. They follow the free form of most nouns, and they function in
derived nouns—see 2.1.1.4.6 and 2.2.2.2.
2.1.1.1.4. Prepositions
The single (inflected) preposition marks the theme/patient NP when a goal is present, and
marks oblique objects to the verb—see 1.2.1.2.2–4.
(384) a.","[230, 231]"
"Wari'332There is also a category of orientation involving two sentence-final clitics: me
‘orientation toward the speaker’ and 'e' ‘orientation away from the speaker’. Their use is
optional. Me is used primarily in constructions involving the first person, whether overtly
expressed or not; 'e' can occur in any construction except prohibitives. Their distribution
is complementary. See the discussion and examples in 1.1.1.3.
2.1.3.6.11. Distinction between different modes of body orientation
No distinction is made between different modes of body orientation.
2.1.3.6.12. Incorporation of verbal elements
There is no incorporation in the language—see 2.2.3.1.2.
2.1.4. Nominal modification
Nominal modification, expressed in many languages via adjectives, is expressed in ‘ON
by nouns (but see 1.2.5.2.5, for a discussion of demonstratives which could possibly be
considered adjectives). Attributive modification is handled like a possessive phrase: the
first syntactically nominal element occurs with a genitive morpheme (nominal
inflectional clitic or suffix) and is understood as modifying the second noun. These
genitive nominal elements can have the form of derived nouns (641a) or -xi' nouns
(641b). In addition, one derived kinship term can also be glossed as a modifier (641c).
(641) a.caxainneinmijacINFL:nrp/photposs:3npig‘roasted (lit. hot) pig’

INFL-father:1s
‘big man’ (lit. ‘the man’s father’)Two preverbal modifiers and one verb also modify nouns in NPS. The verb jimao ‘to be
different’ occurs with only two nouns, as shown in (642c–d).
(642) a.'iri'womtrulycotton‘good clothes’Morphology(642) b.","[344, 345, 346]"
"Pain'narima'nafarinhaTo'o.toastwoman3s:rp/pmanioc:mealf:nameWari'376‘To'o, as a woman, toasted farinha.’In the above examples, there is no possible verb-external source for the incorporated N. It
cannot be the object, since that position is filled. Nor could the incorporated N have
plausibly originated as possessor of the object. Thus we reject incorporation as the source
of the compound verbs in (740)–(741), analysing them instead by (i) zero-derivation of
the ‘nominal’ part of the compound ([N]→[V[N]]), followed by (ii) compounding.
Yet another argument against incorporation comes from our earlier discussion of zeroderivation of verbs from nouns (see 2.2.2.1.2.2). The form of the noun which appears to
the left of the VIC is not predictable from anything to the right of the VIC, i.e. cannot be
predicted via movement into the verb from pre-existent deep structure. Moreover, the
form of the noun which appears in the verb affects the translation of the compound or
simple denominalized verbs in only roughly predictable ways, much more easily
accounted for by compounding, whose semantics are often less than fully compositional,
than by incorporation, which, at least by Baker’s (1988) account, would be expected to be
fully compositional, with no semantic drift at all. We therefore reject incorporation as an
analysis of the above verb forms.
2.2.3.2. Nouns
Compounding is not a productive process for nouns. Nouns zero-derived from
compounded verbs may appear like compounded forms, but we analyse the compounding
as a feature of the verb prior to nominalization, rather than as a property of the noun itself
(see 2.2.3.1 for a discussion of verb compounding). There is one potential case of noun
derivation via compounding, however: the formation of subgroup names by combining
'oro ‘collective’ and the noun. But even in these cases, it seems easiest just to analyse
these as noun phrases which have been zero-derived to form nouns. The reason for this is
that we have various cases of 'oro modifying nouns in examples above, e.g. 'oro hwijima'
‘all the children’, 'oro narima' ‘all the women’ and 'oro carawa ‘all the animals’.
Subgroup names look just like such phrases formally (some clan names involve
deverbalized nouns as well), except that they are interpreted as proper names. Consider
the following:
(742) a.","[388, 389]"
"INFL:nrp/pbig:sposs:3n‘My house is big. Its length (lit. largeness) is eight metres.’2.1.1.4.24. Concessive
There is no special form for marking nominals for the concessive case. Concessive is
expressed by the contraexpective type of verbal modification clause. It is usually
preceded by a clause with paxi' ‘not:find’, which is described in 1.1.2.4.2.8.
(441)Pan'paxi'naxowi'.",[256]
"INFL:irrnot:exist3nINFL:nrp/pgoodneg:p2semph‘Because you are good.’1.4.2. Constituent negation
Constituent negation is expressed by the same devices that express sentence negation.
Compare, for example, the use of 'om ‘not exist’ as the leftmost member of the verb
compound in a derived noun in (294a). It is possible for nouns to be negated by 'om
outside of the VP, in which case 'om occurs without VICS before the noun. This is,
however, rare. (303b) is preferred to (303a).
(303) a.",[186]
"Morphology3472.2.2. Zero-derivation
Zero-derivation is the process whereby words of one syntactic category are derived from
other syntactic categories without affixation (e.g. English He is the head of the
committee; He heads the committee; I will give you a permit; I will permit you). The only
phonological reflex of zero-derivation in ‘ON is the stress shift seen when the category
serving as input to the derivational process is larger than a single word. All words receive
primary stress on their final syllable, modulo certain stress-avoiding postverbal
modifying morphemes, regardless of how many words formed the input to the
derivational process (as in the case of sentences used as verbs). See 2.2.2.1.1 and 3.3.2
below on stress.
2.2.2.1. Verbs
2.2.2.1.1. Zero-derivation from sentences
Verbalized sentences are discussed in section 1.1.1.4.3. The verb in such sentences is
always derived (at least partially) via zero-derivation from clauses, according to the rule
in (666):

"Syntax2171.16.8. Inflectional clitics
There are two classes of inflectional clitics: (1) verbal inflectional clitics, or VICS, which
are marked for person, number and, in some cases, tense/ mood and third person gender
of subjects and objects—see 2.1.3.6.2.2; and (2) possessive nominal inflectional clitics,
or NICS, which mark person, number, and third person gender, appear in derived nouns
and may also follow unpossessed nouns—see 2.1.1.4.6.
1.16.9. Particles
Particles are simple (i.e. phonological) clitics that generally occur at or near the end of
the sentence—see 2.1.8.
1.16.10. INFL morphemes
INFL morphemes cliticize to the verb in COMP sentences, noun clauses and derived
nouns (see 2.1.8.1.9) and express tense/mood and sometimes gender of the element in
COMP (whether overt or covert).
1.16.11. Operator words
Operator words are a small class of words that appear in COMP in COMP sentences—
see 2.1.8.1.10.
1.16.12. Ideophones
Ideophones are onomatopoeic words that express the sound of actions. Many ideophones
deviate from phonological norms of the language: (1) some employ phonological units
not found elsewhere in the language; (2) vowels are often exaggeratedly lengthened; and
(3) varied intonation is often employed: high, low, whispered, etc. See 4.1.","[229, 230]"

"Wari'52‘If he would go.’(9) je ‘third person neuter emphatic pronoun’
When je appears in COMP position, it may be used to express affirmation or
interrogation. When je is followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past present’
or ta ‘realis future’, it has declarative intonation and signals affirmation. When followed
by the INFL morpheme xi ‘irrealis’, it has interrogative intonation and is used to elicit an
agreement from the hearer. Since je does not reference the subject, it may only co-occur
with Tenseless VICS (as in (82b–e) below). When it is followed by ta or xi, it often
employs the use of the postverbal modifier qui' ‘coming this way’. Note the examples in
(82c–e), where a demonstrative pronoun follows je in COMP to form a COMP phrase;
note also the examples in (82g–h), where the gloss of the irrealis constructions is
affirmation (i.e. ‘So you should have talked to me’ and ‘He should not have gone’), but
the implication is that the speaker is asking the hearer for agreement. (82a) shows je
appearing in its nonderived form as an emphatic pronoun. As with all other cases above,
this illustrates what we consider to be its basic use. See also 1.11.2.1.3, on pseudoclefts

2.1.2.3.3. Marking of pronouns for number
Singular-plural distinctions are made only in nonneuter forms (see the table of

The only coordinating element which can be repeated for (nearly) all of the conjuncts is
an emphatic pronoun or third person form of the preposition when used to express ‘and’coordination of the nominal elements of the clause. In this case, all but the first element is
accompanied by a ‘coordinator’. It is possible for an emphatic pronoun to accompany the
first element, but this is rare. See (273) and (274) below.

Juxtaposition and/or the VP ca' na ‘thus it is/was’, which express ‘and’-coordination

Syntax
1.1. GENERAL QUESTIONS
1.1.1. Sentence types
A complete discussion of the three major 'ON sentence types can be found in 1.1.1.4. The
three general classifications are simple, COMP and verbalized (direct speech type)
sentences. A general discussion of direct and indirect speech sentence types,
interrogatives and imperatives, however, follows in sections 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2 and 1.1.1.3.
In this section we distinguish sentences based on a combination of functional and formal
criteria. It is not our claim that the types we identify could not be reduced (or expanded),
merely that distinguishing them here gives the reader the clearest view of how different
communicative functions are accomplished via different forms.
1.1.1.1. Direct and indirect speech sentence types
Direct speech forms are common in 'ON narrative, although they are not always glossed
as literal direct speech. See 1.1.1.4.3 for a discussion of verbalized sentences, and
1.1.1.4.3.2.1 for the description of the structure of verbalized direct speech sentences.
There is no indirect speech type in the language, though the concept can be expressed
in a direct speech present or past tense construction, in which the verbal inflectional clitic
of the matrix clause must be either plural realis past/present or plural passive, as in (1a)
and (2a) respectively. In the case of the latter, the subject of the embedded speech is
coreferential with the object of the matrix clause, and the subject of the matrix clause
must be third person plural, marked only by the VIC, not by a free-form nominal. When
such is not the case, the construction is considered a literal direct speech. The examples
in (1b) and (2b) are only acceptable if they are interpreted as direct speech. An indirect
speech interpretation would not be allowed. The embedded speech in the examples below
is italicized.

seeseego:p1s:rp/p-3pmcollpersonrem:past‘I saw the people off long ago.’ (lit. ‘I saw-went the people long ago.’)Here the suppletive plural form of the verb ‘to go’, mama', is used. This follows if the
construction in (739) is either a serial construction or a compound, since in the former
case, 'oro wari' 'the people' is the subject of mama' ‘to go’, and in the latter case, it is the
object of the entire verb compound, querec querec mama'. But the compound analysis is
again preferred, since without it, we would have to allow for a sequence of verbs
inflected as one, but with different subjects. We conclude, therefore, based on semantics,
syntax and phonology that multiverbal complexes in 'ON are verb compounds and not
serial verbs. Before concluding, however, we also want to argue that our compounding
analysis is also superior to an incorporation analysis.
2.2.3.1.2.2. Incorporation vs compounding Some structures which we have analysed
as zero-derivation plus compounding, might instead be analysed as incorporation. (We
will ignore the possibility of verbal incorporation here, since this would be nearly
equivalent to a serial verb analysis, already rejected.) Consider (740):

"Hwapnapije’.fast:s3s:rp/pchildWari'112‘The child is fast.’ (lit. ‘The child fasts.’)One might attempt to dispute our analysis of the above clauses, arguing instead that the
VIC is acting as a copular verb and that the material on both sides of it is nominal,
functioning as a predicate adjective/nominal. However, there are at least five reasons to
reject this analysis in favour of the analysis in the text, namely, that the material to the
left of the VIC is in fact a zero-derived verb. The reasons are as follows:
(a) Nouns appearing to the left of the VIC are interpreted descriptively (but predicatively)
in the second and third person forms, but actively or even agentively in their first
person form.
(b) These apparent nominals may be compounded with verbs or verbal modifiers.
(c) When compounded, they may undergo semantic drift.
(d) When nonfinal in a compound, a nominal may not bear primary stress (unless
followed by a stress-rejecting modifier).
(e) These noun-verb compounds may be preceded by COMP+INFL sequences.
Moreover, if material to the left of VICS in these ‘copular’ constructions was nonverbal,
this would be the only case in the language where a VIC attaches to nonverbal material.
Segments (a)–(e) are discussed in detail in section 2.2.
The closest thing to a copular construction is a nonverbal sentence in which the
demonstrative ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’, or one of its variants (mon ‘singular
masculine’, momon ‘plural masculine’, mam ‘singular feminine’, mamam ‘plural
feminine’, and main ‘neuter'), or an emphatic pronoun, occurs in the sentence-initial
position, optionally followed by a demonstrative and an NP (which may take the form of
a noun derived from a sentence (168h)). There is no overt be-copula. The demonstrative
in the NP is not obligatory, though it usually occurs.

The third person form of the prepositions may occur with or without an overt NP or

take overt arguments. Note the ungrammatical occurrence of an emphatic pronoun as the
argument of the second person form of the preposition in (239d).

"Morphology2972.1.2.2. Demonstrative pronouns
Demonstrative pronouns occur only in the third person, singular and plural. They are
formed when four proclitics (co ‘singular masculine’, cam ‘singular feminine’, 'i ‘neuter’
and caram ‘plural’) precede the demonstratives described in 1.2.5.2.5 (ca'/cwa' ‘this:n/mf proximate to speaker’, ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’, cain/cwain ‘that:n/m-f distal’,
paca' ‘that just occurred’, cara ne ‘that recently absent’ and cara pane ‘that long
absent’).
These proclitics could be interpreted as prefixes; however, if they were prefixes, the
‘that proximate to hearer’, on co
word-initial nonphonemic glottal stop on ma'
ma' ‘that masculine one proximate to hearer’ and 'i ma' ‘that neuter one proximate to
hearer’ should delete, since word-medial glottal-consonant clusters do not occur. Note
that the word-initial glottal does disappear when the INFL clitic co ‘m/f realis
past/present’ prefixes on to 'aji' ‘my older brother’ to form cwaji' ma ‘your older brother’.
In the case of cwaji' ma, co is obviously a prefix; but in the cases of co ma' and 'i ma', we
believe co and 'i must be interpreted as free clitics, and therefore that cam and caram
must also be interpreted as free clitics.

"0.2. MORPHOLOGY
0.2.1. Word classes
The major word classes and the only open word classes in 'ON are Verb and Noun. Loan
words, for example, must enter the language as nouns or verbs (most frequently as verbs),
regardless of their word class in the source language. However, there are several minor
word classes, including inflectional clitics, subdivisions of nouns and verbs,
demonstrative and emphatic pronouns, and a single preposition, all of which we will
briefly discuss in this overview.
0.2.2. Nouns
Nouns occur in argument and adjunct positions in the clause and trigger agreement on a
preceding preposition or verbal inflectional clitic (VIC). They may also trigger agreement
on a nominal inflectional clitic (NIC), following the possessor noun. Nouns trigger
agreement for person, number and gender. Since only nouns referring to humans may
trigger number agreement, number can be understood as a dependant of the feature
[+human]. Genders are feminine (for human females only), masculine (for human males
or certain animals, fish and bird species) and neuter (for most plants and inanimate
objects). This gives us the values and groups in Table 0.1, according to the grammatical
features [human] and [female]:Table 0.1 Grammatical feature combinations
FEMININENONFEMININE[+HUMAN, +FEMALE][−FEMALE]=MASCULINE
[−HUMAN]=NEUTERThis is an interesting gender distribution, since it does not involve simple conjunctions of
values for the feature pair [human] and [female]. Only human females are marked by
both features, producing the first division. In the second major division, nonfemale, the
features are opposed equipollently rather than privatively. Some nouns in the lexicon will
be marked [+ human, + female], others [−human], and still others merely [−female].1 In
mixed groups, masculine gender is always overridden:
(a)masculine+feminine=feminine(b)masculine+neuter=neuterAs is seen in the main body of the grammar, neuter and feminine are never mixed, nor are
all three genders ever conjoined in a single NP.",[15]

pronouns only occur in the third person; thus this type of anaphora only occurs with third
person referents. See 2.1.2.2 for the complete list of demonstrative pronouns.
Demonstrative pronouns appear as anaphora in two ways.
(1) In narrative discourse, the identity of the main characters is introduced by their
name or an NP, being referred to thereafter by the VICS, forms of the preposition, and
suffixes on possessed nouns. When the identity of the main characters is well known to
the interlocutors, they are often referred to via demonstrative pronouns, rather than
nonpronominal NPS. Demonstrative pronouns can also be used to indicate change of
focus. The object in (317c) is a dead person; dead people are referred to by plural
markers, therefore ‘…caught them’):

"0.3. DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY
Typologists and theoreticians should find 'ON derivational morphology quite interesting
since sentences and phrases productively serve as input to zero-derivation and
compounding. These processes in fact provide interesting evidence for sentence
constituent structure. Zero-derivation takes a word, phrase or clause as input and returns a
single word as output, with no affixation. When the input is larger than a single
grammatical word it may be distinguished from the output prosodically since the output
will receive a single primary stress on its rightmost syllable. The stresses on the rightmost
syllable of each individual word of the input will surface as secondary stresses in the
output. Vowel harmony does not apply across words, even when they have been
compounded.
There is a simple argument which shows that the output Cc zero-derivation of a verb
from a clause is a single word, viz., tense placement. As we remark later on in this
overview and in the main body of the grammar, tense must be the second constituent in
the clause when it occurs. But a tense VIC may follow an entire ‘verbalized’ clause,
strongly supporting our analysis of these structures as single words, i.e. verbs. Another
argument in favour of verbalization of entire clauses is that if they are not verbs they
would be the only examples of nonCOMP or nonverb-initial clauses in the language. This
result is therefore potentially significant for theories of the lexicon and its interface with
the syntax, as well as general typologies of morphological systems.
Nouns can also be zero-derived from various combinations of morphemes, including
verbs, INFL+verb pieces, verb+VIC, entire clauses and nominalized clauses, providing
additional information on constituent structure.
Compounding is another very interesting and highly productive derivational process in
'ON. In fact, nearly all multimorphemic verbs are derived via compounding (except for
zero-derived phrases), with reduplication accounting for the rest. That is, verbs are not
formed by simple affixation, nor by incorporation. Nouns occur in verbs only by zeroderivation, often followed by compounding. This is interesting since regardless of the
morphemic complexity of 'ON verbs, they never undergo affixation (aside from
reduplication). In this sense, 'ON verbal morphology might be considered almost
exclusively derivational, since reduplication itself appears largely, if not completely,
derivational in its meaning, although this cannot be asserted categorically due to the fact
that the output of reduplication semantically is often aspectual. On the other hand,
aspectual morphology is not easily classifiable in terms of the derivational-inflectional
split. If we consider it inflectional, then it is the only case of inflectional verb
morphology. If we consider aspectual change derivational, then 'ON verbs have no
inflectional morphology at all, except for suppletive plural/aspectual forms. The onlyAn overview of 'oro nao' grammar7clear cases of inflectional morphology throughout 'ON grammar are then -xi' nouns, the
preposition, NICS, and VICS, and possibly the emphatic pronouns (if we consider each
of the different emphatic pronominal forms to be derived via suppletive inflection from a
single base—a questionable tactic).","[19, 20]"

repeated in the main clause. The noun phrase is not specially marked. See 1.12.

"Morphology2212.1.1.2.2. Subject of transitive verb
The subject of a transitive verb is (usually) marked on the VIC. Third person subject may
also be overtly expressed by an NP—see 1.2.1.2.1. The number of the subject of a
transitive verb does not govern plural marking on the verb—see 2.3.1.6.1.1. The form of
the overtly expressed subject of a transitive verb is the same as that of an overtly
expressed direct object, unless there is an indirect object in the sentence, in which case
the (erstwhile) direct object occurs in a prepositional phrase—see 1.2.1.2.3.1. When both
subject and object are overtly expressed, the subject almost always follows the object—
see 1.2.1.2.6. There is no distinction between subjects of transitive verbs as agent and
nonagent.
2.1.1.2.3. Subject of copular constructions
Copular constructions do not exist, but see 1.2.1.1, for what we consider a functionally
similar 'ON construction.
2.1.1.2.4. Direct object
The direct object is optionally marked on the VIC. Third person object may also be
overtly expressed by an NP. When an indirect object is in the sentence, whether overtly
expressed or merely marked in the VIC, the direct object may be referenced by an
inflected preposition (or simply understood from context)—see 1.2.1.2.2–3. There is no
change in the form of the overtly expressed object when the subject is not overtly
expressed. Like the subject of intransitive verbs, the object of transitive verbs governs
number agreement on the verb—see 2.1.3.6.2–4.
2.1.1.2.5. Indirect object
See 1.2.1.2.3.
2.1.1.2.6. Object of comparison
Comparison is expressed by means of juxtaposed sentences that show contrasts. The
object of comparison is often the subject or object of such verbs as tiquin' mao ‘to go on’,
tiquin' ca' ‘to pass up’ and juc 'in pin ‘to push away’ in the last of the contrasting
sentences—see 1.1.2.4.2.7.
2.1.1.2.7. Object of equation
Equation is expressed by means of the verb 'an xiho' ‘to imitate’ (387a) or by verb 'ac ‘to
be like’ occurring as the leftmost member of a compound with a noun or emphatic
pronoun (387b–c), or as the operator word in the verbalized comparative clause described
in 1.1.1.4.3.3.6.

section for discussion.
2.2.4. Reduplication
2.2.4.1. Reduplication of verbs
Reduplication is very productive in 'ON. It ranges from monosyllabic and disyllabic
reduplication to repetition of the entire verb.
2.2.4.1.1. Plural/intensive reduplication
Most plural, intense forms of verbs are derived from their singular forms by means of
partial reduplication. This is accomplished either by simply reduplicating the cv of the
stressed syllable once or twice (this process usually takes place with transitive verbs), or
by reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable with a cvrv pattern (this process usually
takes place with intransitive verbs). There are also many singular and plural pairs of
verbs formed by suppletion. Approximately one third are formed by suppletion, one third
by simply reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable, and one third by reduplicating
with the cvrv pattern. Note (744e), where the plural, intense form is the base form for a
form of yet greater intensity.

INFL morphemes are often omitted when the verb is reduplicated. This could be either a
morphological fact, that INFL and reduplication are in complementary distribution, but it
seems more likely to have a semantic account, namely that with progressive aspect
marked in reduplication, INFL is unnecessary. INFL is absent in each of the verbreduplicated clauses below, where it would have otherwise been expected.

Possessive is marked on the possessed element. It is expressed three ways, each of which
applies to a separate class of nouns:
(1) The class of possession marking suffixes inflects for person, number, and third
person gender on the bound form of all -xi' nouns, which are inalienably possessed. The
paradigm of possession marking suffixes is as follows (each of these suffixes has
allomorphs that are phonologically conditioned—see discussion and examples in 3.4):

nouns (they cannot be possessed—see 2.1.1.4.6.1), and others of which, together with all
other unpossessed nouns, can be possessed by:
(2) The class of nominal inflectional clitics that also inflect for person, number, and
third person gender. None of these NICS has allomorphs. The paradigm of NICS is
identical in function and phonologically similar to the possessive suffixes described
above. It is as follows:

the discussion and examples in 2.2.2.2.1.5.
2.1.1.4.6.1. Alienable and inalienable possession Co- kinship terms, derived from
relative clauses (see 2.2.2.2.1.5), are inalienably possessed, as are -xi' nouns, so-called
because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi' ‘first person plural inclusive’. Most xi' nouns have free alternate forms which can be divided into two classes: (1)
nonpossessed forms, which cannot be possessed; and (2) unpossessed forms, which are
accepted by some speakers in alienable possession. The nonpossessed class of nouns
consists of words for body parts: 'at ‘bone’, waji' ‘head’, caxim ‘foot’, jat ‘tooth’, 'ut
‘nose’. Possession of words in this class of nouns must be expressed by the inflection of
their -xi' forms, rather than their free forms:

2.1.1.5.1. Introduction
Location in space is expressed (1) by verbs (compound or simple); and/or (2) by bodypart nouns. While the type of location (general, interior, ulterior, etc.) may be expressed
by the body-part noun functioning as the object of the verb, movement in relation to the
location (‘at rest’, ‘motion to’, ‘motion from’, or ‘motion past’) is expressed only by the
verb. The noun to which the local function is related appears as an object of the verb, or
as the possessor of an object of the verb. We will describe in this section the means for
expressing local semantic functions, although none of these involves special case
marking on the noun.
(1) Location in space expressed by verbs
Some types of location in space are expressed by verbs that indicate specific types of
motion or states (‘at rest’, ‘motion to’, ‘motion from’ and ‘motion past’) inherent in their
meaning, e.g. pe/to ‘to be at’ for general ‘at rest’ location, wixicam ‘to go near’ for
proximate ‘motion to’ location, xom tacam' ‘to cross over a river to the other side’ for
ulterior ‘motion to’ location, etc. It is, however, more common for the specific categories
of local function to be expressed by a set of verbs and postverbal modifiers that explicitly
indicate location: pe/to ‘to be at’, mao/mama' ‘to go’ (meaning ‘going that way’ when
appearing in postverbal modification position), qui' ‘coming this way’ and ca' ‘this
neuter’ (meaning ‘from’ or ‘away from’ when occurring in postverbal modification
position). We call these location verbs.
‘Motion at rest’ can be expressed by the verb pe/to ‘to be at’, appearing either in a
noncompounded verb (448a–b) or as the rightmost member of a compound verbMorphology247(postverbal modification position) (448c–d). When appearing in a compound verb, pe/to
conveys the idea that the action of the verb with which it occurs was executed, and then
the participant remained in the position occupied after completing the action. Compare
(448c–f) with the other examples in (448) below.
