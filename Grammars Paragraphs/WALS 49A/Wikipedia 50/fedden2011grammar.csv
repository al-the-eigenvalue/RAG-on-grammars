"IntroductionMian noun phrase syntax is rigid. All noun phrases conform to the following
structural template, which specifies the structure of maximally complex noun
phrases:
Prenominal
adjective
Prenominal relative
clause
Prenominal modifierPossessorHead
nounPostnominal
adjective(s)QuantifierDeterminerThe head noun slot can only hold an item of the category N, which includes
verbal nouns. A pronoun can instantiate a full noun phrase. Headless
adjectives can constitute a noun phrase of their own. In that case the head
noun slot is empty.
Any material filling the possessor slot must be either a possessive pronoun
or a noun phrase. The prenominal adjective slot can accommodate one
adjective of the two sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’. The head noun can be
preceded by a prenominal relative clause or by one of two prenominal
modifiers omômom ‘all kinds of’ and inamìn ‘such’. In these cases there must
not be a possessor. The postnominal adjective slot can be filled by one or
more adjectives. Postnominal adjectives are followed by quantifiers. The
determiner slot can be filled by the article or any of those pronouns which can
be used adnominally (Himmelmann 1997: 215-219).
Table 6.1 lists examples illustrating noun phrases of different complexity.
All of these structures are discussed below. For a short overview of relative
clauses, see 6.3.8. For a detailed description of relative clauses, see 13.3.
The normal situation in natural Mian discourse is that the clitic article
occurs only once on the rightmost constituent of a noun phrase that is used
referentially:
(1)tíl
milil
sm=e
dog
black
big=SG.M
‘a/the big, black dog’2046. The noun phraseTable 6.1. Noun phrase examples

modifiers:

pronominally, i.e. they can constitute noun phrases by themselves. For details
on the form and the semantics of the respective pronoun series and for more
examples, see 3.7.
All of these can occur in subject position. Free pronouns occasionally
occur in object position whereas the other pronoun series are so far only
attested in subject position.
Forms from either of the reflexive series appear as objects if their function
is to indicate reflexivity:

English ‘I myself killed the pig’, the pronoun can appear in apposition to an
overt subject noun phrase, as in (4) or on its own in lieu of an overt subject
noun phrase, as in (5):

determiner, or a noun followed by a determiner, e.g. a clitic article or an
adnominal pronoun.","[229, 230, 231]"
"Dyadic termsDyadic terms are a subclass of the word class of nouns. They refer to a social
or a kin relationship between two or more people and encode relational
opposites (Evans 2003a, 2006). They can function as heads of noun phrases
which in turn are arguments of the predicate in the same clause. An example is
given in (69):2246. The noun phrase(69)dab=i

leave.PFV-give.PFV-N2.R-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ-GPST=MED
‘after the brothers had left it (as it was), one of them…’ [Danenok]
Most frequently, dyads occur with a plural possessive pronoun which refers to
the whole set of individuals described by the dyad. The possessive pronoun
has appositive meaning:
(70)b
mikim
opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)
2PL.POSS
‘you, brother and sister’The reason why I analyse the dyad as the noun phrase head with a possessive
pronoun in the possessor slot and not as a noun phrase apposed to a free
pronoun (an analysis suggested by the English translation I have chosen for
example (70) is because the pronoun forms are clearly from the possessive
pronoun series:
(71)*bomikimIn (71) the free personal pronoun cannot be used, cf. also nb mikim ‘we
(INCL), brother and sister’ and unacceptable *nbo mikim. I assume that the
possessive analysis is extended to the cases where the possessive pronoun is
homophonous with the free pronoun:
(72)
mikim
opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)
3PL.AN.POSS
‘they, brother and sister’ [MPI Reciprocals clip 1]Dyads can be preceded by a proper name or kin noun, which is in an
appositional relation with the dyad, forming an inclusory construction.
Reference is to the dyad of individuals, only one of which is explicitly named.

"Typological profileMian has a relatively small segmental phoneme inventory though of fairly
typical shape and size by Papuan standards. An unusual feature of the
segmental inventory is the presence of a contrast between a plain /a/ (spelled
<a>) and a pharyngealized /a/ (spelled <aa>). The tonal phonology is
complex. Mian is a word tone language, i.e. the domain for the assignment of1.3. Typological profile7one of five tonal melodies (H, L, LH, LHL, and HL) is the phonological word,
not the syllable. Lexemes are specified for one tonal melody and an accent
which serves as the anchor point for the melody. Tonal melodies spread over
the entire phonological word including all affixes and most clitics. Verbal and
nominal compounds are treated as a single word phonologically, i.e. they have
one tonal melody (i.e. a composite of both stem tones) and one accent. The
tonal inventory of compounds is a proper subset of the tonal melodies found
on monomorphemic words. While the function of tone is mainly to make
lexical distinctions, there is one tense (the non-hodiernal past) which is
marked tonally for some verbs in addition to a suffix.
There is hardly any nominal inflectional morphology. The only inflectional
noun suffix is -wal, which signals plural and only attaches to a subset of the
noun vocabulary to boot, namely kin nouns, dyads, and proper names, where it
indicates an associative plural. If a noun is used referentially, it is followed by
a cliticized article which is etymologically related to the third person free
pronouns. There is a tendency to use inanimate nouns without this marker,
even if they are used referentially. There are several derivational noun
suffixes which derive adverbs from nouns and express meanings like
instrumental, e.g. sbun-dum ‘with a spoon’. Furthermore, there is a
derivational suffix -an, which attaches to either nouns or adjectives to form
verbs. The meaning is inchoative, e.g. ayam ‘good’ and ayam-an- ‘become
good’. These derived forms are further inflected as intransitive verbs.
Mian has four genders: Masculine, feminine, neuter 1 and neuter 2 which
are defined by sets of agreement markers. Agreement targets are the
adnominally used pronouns, the article and demonstratives, and the
pronominal affixes on the verb.
The structure of the noun phrase is relatively simple and constituent order
within the noun phrase is fixed. The leftmost position is the possessor slot. It
can be filled by a possessive pronoun or a noun phrase expressing the
possessor. Most adjectival modifiers and quantifiers follow the noun. The
adjectives sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ tend to precede the noun but they can
also follow it. The rightmost position in the noun phrase is reserved for a
determiner, e.g. a clitic pronominal article or an adnominally used emphatic
pronoun. The clitic article can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and
show up on the head noun, all adjectival modifiers, and on numerals. Mian has
prenominal and head-internal relative clauses. The former are unmarked
clauses embedded in the noun phrase before the head noun, the latter are
essentially clausal noun phrases and end with a determiner, such as an article.
Mian only has postpositions many of which have a noun origin.
About half of the Mian verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with
formally distinct perfective and imperfective stems. This is a typical feature of
the Ok languages and also found in Telefol and Tifal. Outside of Ok, aspect81. The language and its speakersdistinctions in the stem can be found in the Papuan languages Marind and
Kiwai (Foley 1986: 146-148), in Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and in Abui
(Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86). Some verb stems (approximately 50) are defective
and lack either the perfective or the imperfective stem. The rest of the verb
stems are trans-aspectual and do not have a formal perfective-imperfective
distinction.
Verbal morphology is complex. Mian is mainly a nominative-accusative
language though in a limited number of cases argument marking proceeds on
an absolutive basis, mainly – but not exclusively – with classificatory prefixes,
which index transitive objects and intransitive subjects. Alignment in
ditransitives is indirective.
Mian is basically head-marking at the clause level and mildly
polysynthetic. Core arguments are subject (S) in intransitive clauses, subject
(A) and object (O) in monotransitive clauses, and subject (A), object (O) and
recipient (R) in ditransitive clauses. There is no morphological case- or
adpositional marking for these. Core arguments are cross-referenced on the
verb by cross-referencing affixes. These index all subjects and recipients. The
language is not fully head-marking at the clause level because many transitive
verbs do not index their object. Object prefixation is only found in a small
number of transitive verbs, including ‘see’, ‘kill’, ‘grab’, and ‘bite’.
In the perfective, recipient arguments are introduced through a compound
construction with -(û)b’- ‘give’, or allomorphs thereof. In contemporary Mian,
-(û)b’- ‘give’ and its allomorphs serve a quasi-applicative function. In the
imperfective, recipient suffixes immediately follow the verb stem. The notion
of ‘recipient’ is semantically relatively general and includes benefactives and
malefactives, possessors, goals of ballistic motion, and experiencers.
In addition to the argument affixes, which work on a nominativeaccusative basis, Mian has a set of classificatory verb prefixes which are
obligatory for some verbs, most of which involve the handling or
manipulation of objects, including predications such as ‘take’, ‘throw’, ‘give’,
and ‘fall’. The classificatory prefixes classify a verbal argument according to
semantic criteria, such as biological sex but also shape and function on an
absolutive basis, i.e. classification extends to the subject of intransitive verbs
and the object of transitive verbs. These prefixes are in many ways
reminiscent of classificatory verbal elements in various North-American
languages, e.g. Navajo and Diegueño.
Inflectional tense, aspect, and mood marking is moderately complex. The
verb has two slots for TAM suffixes which are on either side of the subject
suffix slot. The pre-subject slot is filled by various tense, aspect, and mood
markers. The post-subject slot can only be filled by tense markers (which are
formally and semantically distinct from those in the pre-subject slot). There1.3. Typological profile9are some co-occurrence restrictions pertaining to the suffixes in these two
slots.
Verbs are inflected directly for some TAM categories, but for others the
verb must be serialized with an auxiliary before the respective TAM suffixes
can attach.
Mian makes pervasive use of chaining constructions. Verbs can be
serialized at the core or the nuclear level of the clause. Serialized verbs share
the same subject which is marked on the last verb in the construction. An
exception is the causative serial verb construction, in which subject marking
indexes the causer on the first verb of the serialization and the causee on the
second verb. The predications expressed by a core serial verb constructions
are of relatively low semantic integration and serialized transitive verbs
commonly have their own overt object noun phrases. Serializations on the
nuclear level of the clause are possible. They are tighter-knit than core
serializations and do not allow separate objects.
Clause chaining is very common in Mian. Verbs can be medial and
function as the predicate of a medial clause or final and function as the
predicate of an independent sentence or the last clause in a clause chain.
Medial verbs show switch-reference morphology indicating whether the
subject of the succeeding clause is co-referent or disjoint in reference, in
addition to marking events as sequential or simultaneous. In languages that
use clause chaining, medial verbs are often morphologically impoverished.
Mian medial verbs, however, only have the morphological restriction that they
cannot be marked for polarity, irrealis or deontic mood or be followed by one
of the sentence-final illocutionary clitics. The Mian switch-reference system
has a typologically unusual property in that ‘same subject’ marking by -n only
forces the following subject to be co-referent in the first person singular. In all
other person-number combinations the switch-reference meaning of -n is
suspended and the suffix only indicates sequentiality of events.
Adverbial clauses with temporal, locative or conditional meaning – like
head-internal relative clauses – are clausal noun phrases and function as
referring expressions in Mian. They are followed by the default neuter article
=o. Other embedded structures found in the language are embedded questions
and quotatives.
Unmarked constituent orders in medial and final clauses and independent
sentences are SV and AOV. Due to the head-marking characteristics of the
language, constituent order is relatively flexible with the mandatory restriction
that the verb be clause-final. The verb can only be followed by =ba, signalling
negative polarity, and/or an illocutionary clitic particle, which marks
independent sentences or whole clause chains as declarative, exclamative,
interrogative, quotative, or hortative. Post-verbal locative adverbials following
motion verbs are possible but rare and always constitute their own intonational101. The language and its speakersunit. Under no circumstances can the verb be followed by an overt core noun
phrase argument.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
"Attributive possessionAs we are dealing with noun phrase structure here, this section is confined to
attributive possession. For a description of predicative possession, see section
9.11.3.
Mian has one construction for encoding attributive possession in which the
possessor precedes the possessed. This is the typical order for verb-final
languages (Dryer 2007: 62). The possessor slot can be filled either by a
possessive pronoun or by a full noun phrase.
In the most common and least complex case the possessor slot is filled by a
possessive pronoun. The forms are set out in the tables 6.2 and 6.3. The free
pronoun forms have been included to illustrate the obvious formal relations
between the two pronoun series. Distinct forms for the possessive and the free
pronoun series are given in boldface. Grey areas indicate the neutralization of
a gender contrast.

referent is possessed by the referent of the preceding noun phrase:
(54)nái=e
ken=e
milím=e
half=SG.N1
vagina=SG.N1 edge=SG.N1
‘half of the edge of the vagina’ [Fitibkanib and Dimosson]Typically, there is no overt marker indicating a possessive relation. Rather,
possessor and possessed are simply juxtaposed:
(55)éil=e
gabáam=e
pig=SG.M head=SG.N1
‘a/the pig’s head’There is a clear syntactic structure in Mian attributive possessives. Changing
the order of possessor and possessed might at best considerably alter the
meaning but will in most cases lead to non-sensical utterances.
An alternative, though much less common construction involves the use of
an overt possessive pronoun between the possessor and the possessed, as in
the following example:
(56)éil=e

gabáam=e
head=SG.N1
pig=SG.M 3SG.M
‘a/the pig’s head’ (lit. ‘a/the pig, its head’)This construction is rare and it is my impression that it is predominantly found
where the possessor is a proper name, as in (57). Note, however, that this
could also be rendered as Selimine kukub le with the same meaning:
(57)
kukub =le
3SG.M
habit
N2=TOP
‘as for Selimin’s habit’ (lit. ‘as for Selimin his habit’) [Selimin]
Selimin=ePN=SG.MIf the possessor is a coordinate noun phrase, the possessive construction with
an overt possessive pronoun referring to the whole set of possessors is
obligatory. This is illustrated for two different types of coordination, namely
(a) coordination with the clitic =sa ‘too’ in (58) and (b) simple juxtaposition
in (59).

Fitibkanib=oDimosonPN=SG.FPNTwo issues remain to be addressed in connection with possessive
constructions in Mian. The first problem is how far possessive constructions
can be straightforwardly distinguished from compounding. The second issue
has to do with constituent order in the noun phrase, especially with the
evidence for assuming both a possessor slot and a prenominal adjective slot.
In some cases the distinction between a possessive construction and a
compound is fuzzy. Consider the example al atosîn [bowels bit(s)]. Would
this be better glossed as ‘bit(s) of bowels’ or as ‘bowel bit(s)’? While both
analyses seem possible, it is noticeable that in al atosîn the first noun appears
without an article or any other adnominal pronoun, which make the whole
construction look like two compounded stems. Hence, I opt for the compound
analysis here. If the first element in a complex noun phrase appears without an
article (and without any other pronominal element), the construction is a
compound (i.e. al atosîn ‘bowel bit(s)’). If the first noun is followed by an
article, the construction is possessive (i.e. al=o atosîn ‘bit of bowels’). See
Healey (1965a: 10-11) for a description of a similar problem in Telefol. Tonal
evidence supports this analysis. Compounds constitute a single tonal domain.
The tone on the compound is a composite melody consisting of a sequence of
the respective stem melodies and is assigned to the compound as a whole. In a
possessive construction, possessor and possessed constitute two distinct tonal
domains.
As far as the ordering of possessor and possessed is concerned, there is
syntactic evidence that the position of the possessor must be to the left of the
possessed noun with all its adjectival modifiers, rather than just to the left of
the noun. Although the standard word order in modified noun phrases is noun
head followed by one or more postnominal modifiers, the adjectival modifiers
sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’, tend to occur before the head noun:

be_sick.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘My old grandfather is sick.’
In example (60), sin ‘old’ can only be interpreted as a modifier. Hence, to say
that the possessor slot immediately precedes the noun would be inaccurate.
Rather, the possessor slot immediately precedes the noun with all its
modifiers.","[242, 243, 244, 245, 246]"
"3. Word classes and grammatical relationsObjectMian has a single grammatical relation of object, which can be
morphologically indexed in different ways, so that the indexing patterns on the
verb do not correspond to the grammatical relations which can be established
on syntactic grounds. All objects can be modified, quantified, topicalized and
questioned. All objects can be relativized as well, but the relativization options
are subject to some restrictions for verbs which do not index their object. This
will be discussed in more detail below.
In all cases, the object is the noun phrase which matches the person,
number, and in the third person also the gender value of the object index on
the verb. Object noun phrases are never overtly case-marked. The way objects
are indexed on the verb depends on lexical factors. There are four distinct
patterns of object indexation.
First, the object can be marked by a pronominal prefix according to an
accusative pattern, e.g.:
(213) no=i
marsupial=PL.AN
ya-l-êt-n-e=ta
PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-carry.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
‘he killed and brought/carried the marsupials and then ...’ [Crows]
Semantically, objects indexed with a pronominal prefix mostly have the role
of patient.
Second, the object can be marked by a classificatory prefix according to an
absolutive pattern, i.e. the object of a transitive verb (214) or the subject of an
intransitive verb (215) are indexed, e.g.:
(214) ti=e
blade=SG.Mbáangkli=e
stone_adze=SG.Mdeb-êt-n-o=a
3SG.M_CL.O-carry.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
‘she carried a báangkli adze and then ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]

tl-Ø-o=ta
3SG.F-CL.SBJ-fall.PFV
come.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
‘Dabein came falling down (i.e. from the sky) and ...’ [Sofelok, 1]
PN3.14. Grammatical relations165Semantically, objects indexed with a classificatory prefix mostly have the role
of theme or patient.
Third, the object can be marked by a pronominal suffix according to an
indirective pattern. In the perfective, the suffix must be appended to -ûb’‘give’, which is compounded with another verb. In the imperfective,
suffixation is directly to the stem. For a detailed description, see 8.5.5.
(216) unáng=o
baa-ˆb’-o-n-e=o=le
woman=SG.F say.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.F.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=N2=TOP
‘and when he said to the woman’ [Pig story]
Such objects most commonly have the role of recipient, benefactive,
malefactive, possessor, or experiencer. Finally, there are verbs which never
mark their object, e.g.:
(217) unín=o
dowôn’-Ø-i=a
eat.PFV-DS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
food=N2
‘I eat food and then someone else ...’ [Newlyweds]
In this case, there is no indicator on the verb which makes the object relation
explicit, so the object is the noun phrase which is not indexed on the verb. In
most cases animacy differences (objects of verbs without object prefix are
overwhelmingly inanimate) and the semantics and context of the whole
utterance also help identify the object. Furthermore, many verbs without an
object prefix only occur with a relatively small range of possible object noun
phrases, as in the case of halbû’ ‘fold (IPFV)’, or even only with a single
possible object noun phrase (as in the case of êi ‘accumulate, impound
(water)’ or kè ‘cut (scraped taro) into slabs’, for which the objects can only
ever be aai ‘water’ and imen nini ‘scraped taro’, respectively.
The absence of the prefix on these verbs has a syntactic consequence.
When a verb does not index its object relativization with a prenominal relative
clause is impossible and relativization with a head-internal relative clause is
only possible if the head is not omitted. This is illustrated in the following
examples. A prenominal relative clause is not allowed when the object is not
indexed, as in (218), but is fine when it is indexed, as in (219):

object is present in the clause in some way or other, either as a prefix or as an
overt noun phrase. Thus, the syntactic effect correlates with a morphological
effect, namely the presence or absence of the prefix. As this is more a
morphological issue than a syntactic one I do not see a reason why the nonsubject noun phrases of verbs like fu ‘cook’, which do not cross-reference this
noun phrase with a prefix, should not be objects.
To sum up, Mian has one grammatical relation of object, which can be
marked in three different ways. The object can also be not marked on the verb.","[190, 191, 192]"
"Simple spatial
postpositionpostpositionalphraseswithanominalThese consist of a noun phrase followed by a nominal postposition, which are
derived from nouns. Some (but not all) of these are also used as nouns in
contemporary Mian. The term nominal postposition is clarified further below.
Nominal postpositions are:
(14)dim
tem
tabáab
glagl
tib‘on, onto’
‘in, into’
‘under, beneath’
‘between’
‘on(to) the surface of’The postpositions tem ‘in(to)’ and dim ‘on(to)’ are derived from nouns. For
tem ‘in(to)’, there is a homophonous nominal form with the meaning ‘hole,
inside’, cf. amún-tem [belly-hole] ‘abdominal cavity’ rather than *‘in(to) the
belly’. The noun dim ‘top’ is attested in the compound amgolim [am-go-dim
house-head-top] ‘roof’, rather than *‘onto the roof’. The postposition tib is
derived from the noun tib ‘outside (of hide or fur)’.
Therefore, I choose the term ‘nominal postpositions’ for the five words
under discussion. Although neither tabáab ‘under, beneath’ nor glagl
‘between’ can be shown to be related to a noun in the way that tem ‘in(to)’ and
dim ‘on(to)’ are related to nouns, they behave the same syntactically and are
therefore included in the class of nominal postpositions. On the issue of the
nominal origin of postpositions in many languages, see Dryer (2007: 85-86).
Two examples of nominal postpositions are provided below:
(15)tek=dim
rope=on(to)
‘on(to) the rope’(16)mikil=tabáab
mountain=under
‘under the mountain (i.e. at the foot of the mountain)’7.2. Simple spatial postpositional phrases with a nominal postposition237The postpositional phrase can be followed by an article. In this case the
postposition does not cliticize. The article agrees in gender and number with
the preceding noun. The following example shows that the article following
the postposition agrees in gender and number with tek ‘rope’ (N1):
(17)yóum=e
piece_of_clothing=SG.N1tek
rope(N1)dim=e
on(to)=SG.N1do-fâ-n-ebo=be
3SG.M_CL.O-put.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
‘You put the piece of clothing on the line.’
In contrast to postpositional phrases with a directional postposition, in which
the noun phrase always has to be bare, in postpositional phrases with a
nominal postposition like dim ‘on(to)’ or tem ‘in(to)’ they can have an article,
but not any of the other adnominal pronouns:
(18)tek=e
dim(=e)
on(to)(=SG.N1)
rope=SG.N1
‘on(to) the rope’Therefore, a structure like (19) above has probably originated in a noun
phrase, in which tek=e ‘the rope’ was the possessor:
(19)tek=e
dim(=e)
top(=SG.N1)
rope=SG.N1
‘top of the rope’Further evidence for this etymology comes from the following construction
involving dim (20) and tem (21), where we find an appositional structure, in
which the possessor is cross-referenced by a possessive pronoun:
(20)itú=e

dim=e
SG.N1
top=SG.N1
fence=SG.N1
‘on the fence’ (lit. ‘the fence, its top’) [Building a Spirit House](21)toli=e

tem=e
SG.N1
inside=SG.N1
arrow_type=SG.N1
‘(pierced) on (the tip of) a toli arrow’ (lit. ‘the toli arrow, its
inside’) [Initiation rites]2387. The postpositional phraseIn these examples, an overt possessive pronoun cross-references the
possessors itú=e ‘the fence’ and toli=e ‘the toli arrow’, respectively. (On
attributive possession, see section 6.6). Note, however, that this construction is
only found in a traditional initiation account by a speaker in his late eighties. It
is not used by younger speakers.
Unlike directionals which can only occur with an agreeing article or the
default article =o, nominal postpositions retain the nominal property of
occurring with different determiners. Emphatic pronouns (22) and
demonstratives (23) are attested:

DEM.PROX.SG.N1
plate=in
‘on (lit. in) this plate’Nominal postpositions retain an important feature of nouns, namely to have an
article or other determiner, and therefore make the structures in which they
occur look like noun phrases in some respect. On the other hand, phrases with
nominal postpositions differ in their external syntax from noun phrases. They
are restricted to occurring with certain adverbial functions. Under no
circumstances can a phrase with a nominal postposition be in a core argument
position (see Dryer 2007: 85).
Phonologically, the nominal postposition dim ‘on, onto’ fuses with nouns
ending in /l/, as in (24), the postposition tem ‘in, into’ fuses with nouns ending
in /t/, as in (25):

"10.2. Content questions391The interrogative words fàb and wan neither encode number nor gender.
Emphatic pronouns, which can be compounded with both fàb and wan, have
to encode number and in the third person singular also gender. Mian
interrogative words do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites, as interrogatives do for example in Japanese (Nichigauchi 1990)
or in the Australian languages Kayardild (Evans 1995: 365) and Kuuk
Thaayorre (Gaby 2006: 243-244). Both fàb and wan can be used pronominally
and adnominally.
Content questions in Mian usually have declarative (i.e. falling) intonation,
but can be intonationally marked by a quick rise and subsequent fall of pitch
on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is invariably formed by the
illocutionary particle. This intonational pattern is very similar to the one found
in polar questions.
The interrogative clitic =e can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to indicate that the speaker assumes that the addressee wants this action
to be performed by the speaker (or by a group to which both speaker and
addressee belong), e.g.:
(20)fàb
o-fâ-n-an=e?

‘Where shall I put it?’ [Observed]Interrogative phrases, which contain the interrogative words fàb and wan,
always appear in situ, i.e. they occur in the same position as non-interrogative
phrases with the same grammatical function (Li and Thompson 1984: 51,
Dryer 2005).
As in polar and alternative questions, constituent order is not changed with
respect to the corresponding declarative sentence and the interrogative phrase
occupies the position which the queried constituent would have in an
appropriate answer sentence.
There are a few cases where the interrogative phrase seems to be not in situ
but rather to be postposed after the verb. I will turn to this issue in more detail
below.","[416, 417]"
"DitransitivesThe verb -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is an underived ditransitive. It belongs to the class
of verbs which obligatorily cross-reference and classify the theme object, i.e.
the gift, with a classificatory prefix (see 9.2.1). In addition, it also takes an
object suffix that cross-references the recipient argument (plus another suffix
for the subject). Thus, -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is an examples of triple agreement,
i.e. the indexing of subject and two objects (theme and recipient) by affixes on
the verb (Fedden 2010). Triple agreement is a typologically rare phenomenon,
both in Papuan languages and world-wide (Foley 2000). An example of -ûb’‘give (PFV)’ is given in (55):3529. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause(55)n

‘I gave the sow to the man.’
For details on the derived nature of the imperfective counterpart -ka- ‘give
(IPFV)’, the reader is referred to 9.6.2.2.
The ditransitive verb -fu- ‘send to (PFV-only)’1 involves compounding with
-ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ in order to introduce the recipient argument. It indexes the
theme with a classificatory prefix. The recipient argument is marked by a
suffix on the ‘give’-morpheme compounded with the main verb. Consider
example (56):
(56)

say.PFV-REAL-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
say.PFV
‘She said she would send a letter to him.’ (lit. ‘She said: “I will
send a letter to him.” ’)
Although the recipient role of -fu- ‘send to (PFV)’ is obligatorily introduced
through serialization with ‘give’, which suggests derivation from a simpler
transitive base, such a transitive base does not exist: *-fu ‘send (PFV)’. Hence,
an utterance like (57) is ungrammatical regardless of whether the recipient is
expressed with a free noun phrase (in this case the pronoun n ‘me’):
(57)*futaan=o
(n)
om-fu-n-e=be
(1SG) 3SG.F_CL.O-send.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
letter=N2
Intended: ‘He sent (me) a letter.’The same applies to ale- ‘show’, which lacks a transitive base *ale. As for -fu‘send to (PFV)’, the recipient argument, or in the case of ‘show’ the recipientlike argument, is introduced by ‘give’ in the perfective. The theme participant,
i.e. the ‘shown’, is never cross-referenced on the verb by a pronominal affix
but can be encoded as a free noun phrase, as in (58):9.6. Derived ditransitives(58)353kasak=e

‘they had shown us the Kasak (ritual), and then someone else...’
[Kasak ritual]In natural Mian discourse overt noun phrase arguments are typically elided if
their identity is retrievable from the context even if the argument is not
indexed on the verb. Parallel to the case of elided object noun phrases in
transitive verbs, which were discussed in section 9.2.4 above, I have no
evidence suggesting that the verb ale- ‘show’ becomes monotransitive, i.e.
only has a subject and a recipient object (indexed with a suffix), when the
overt object noun phrase (referring to the entity shown) is elided. Therefore, I
analyse ale- ‘show’ as an underived ditransitive verb whose object noun
phrase can be freely elided without assuming a change in argument structure.
To sum up, the clearest example of an underived ditransitive verb in Mian
is -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’. It encodes the theme with a set of prefixes and the
recipient and the subject with two different sets of suffixes. In the case of -fu‘send to (PFV)’, we are dealing with a lexicalization, which is underived (at
least in contemporary Mian). A similar argument can be made for ale- ‘show
to (PFV)’.","[377, 378, 379]"
"Argument order in transitive clausesAll overtly realized arguments are either free pronouns or full noun phrases.
Rarely, both subject and object are overtly realized as free pronouns. In such
cases, the subject always precedes the object. This is independent of whether
the object is indexed on the verb with prefix (89) or a suffix (90):

If the arguments are instantiated by full noun phrases instead of pronouns, the
unmarked constituent order is AOV. Overt subject noun phrases usually
precede object noun phrases. This order is very consistently observed in
elicited examples, e.g.:
(91)naka=e
unáng=o
man=SG.M woman=SG.F
‘The man saw the woman.’wa-têm’-Ø-e=be
3SG.F.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECLIn natural discourse, however, relative order of subject and object noun
phrases is less consistently A followed by O. This usually does not create
ambiguities due to the language’s head-marking characteristics, which in most
cases allow the identification of syntactic relations through information from
the pronominal and classificatory affixes without having to take constituent
order information into account. Deviation from the unmarked order in natural
discourse will be discussed in 9.10.1 below.
Although unmarked constituent order in Mian is AOV, verb-final position
is really all that is mandated. Hence, it is possible to invert subject and object
if both grammatical relations are realized by overt noun phrases.
In many cases, argument indexing disambiguates as in example (92) where
the pronominal affixes -e and wa- clearly indicate that the man is the ‘seer’
and the woman the ‘seen’:
(92)unáng=o
naka=e
wa-têm’-Ø-e=be
woman=SG.F man=SG.M 3SG.F.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘The man has seen the woman.’A natural example is (93) where argument indexing on the verb indicates who
leads whom. Preposed objects are typically topics and marked with the topic

PL.AN.O-take.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED‘As for the children, Sobining took them and then ...’ [Sobining]3649. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseI analyse examples like (93) as topicalizations rather than cleft structures
because there are no cues that suggest the latter analysis, such as presence of a
copula or an obvious bi-clausal structure.
Argument inversion is not possible with pronominal subjects without topic
marking of the object. Compare (94) and (95):
(94)imen =le

wen-b-i=be

Thus, (96) is bad as well.

1SG 3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL

Intended: ‘I’ve seen the man.’I will mention here in passing that in (core-level) serial verb constructions,
overt object noun phrases can appear inside the verb serialization, if they are
exclusive to one of the verbs in the chain:

buried her’ not of haka ‘break’. For details, see section 11.1.1.3 on serial verb
constructions.","[388, 389, 390]"
"Emphatic pronouns as noun phrase determinersApart from the pronominal clitic article, the function of the determiner can be
served by an emphatic pronoun (see section 3.7.4), which is used adnominally.
The following examples illustrate the use of emphatic pronouns in noun
phrases which consist solely of an adjective (13) or a numeral (14):

In natural Mian discourse, all adnominally used pronouns can optionally form
one phonological unit with the preceding word. Thus, we find aab ta ‘the
brother (EMPH)’ pronounced [aph] [ .ta] and aab=ta [a. .ta] also with
the meaning ‘the brother (EMPH)’. This behaviour is different from that of
articles which (almost) always cliticize. Suprasegmentally, however,
adnominally used emphatic pronouns and articles are very similar. If one of
the former cliticizes to the noun, its high tone can disappear. Thus, we not
only find aab=ta [a. .ta] but also aab=eta [a..ta] with no difference in
meaning. This alternation is exactly parallel to the free variation between
naka= [na.ka. ] with a high-toned article and naka=e [na.ka.], where the
article is unspecified for tone, both with the meaning ‘a/the man’.","[233, 234]"
"Verbs with obligatory classificatory prefixBelow are listed the most frequent verbs which require a classificatory prefix.
In a few cases, the classificatory prefix is frozen in the singular form of the

‘fetch water’. In the case of the perfective-only stem -kilêb ‘put handle of bag

nominal classification systems, which show different formal and semantic
properties, exist next to and interact with each other.
First, there is the category ‘gender’ with the masculine, feminine, neuter 1
and 2 subcategories. All pronominal affixes on the verb agree in person,
number and gender with the arguments they cross-reference. If the verb occurs
without overt noun phrase arguments, pronominal affixes agree anaphorically
with a previously mentioned overt noun phrase argument.
These instances of agreement are predictable from the person, number and
gender of the nominal argument. In other words, pronominal affixes never
have any semantic impact on the noun or its noun phrase. Their function is to
indicate grammatical relations in the clause and to enable construal of any
overt arguments with their respective cross-referencing affix by showing
agreement.
In addition, there are the categories (prefix classes) established by sets of
classificatory prefixes. There are four reasons why I consider this system of
classificatory prefixes to be different from the system of gender agreement.
First, only some verbs with similar semantics of object manipulation or
handling participate in the system of classificatory prefixes, whereas
pronominal affixes can be found on all finite verbs.","[220, 221]"
"An analytical issue in head-internal relative clausesSo far I have been assuming without justification that head-internal relatives
are clauses. It is now time to justify this assumption. Consider (70):
(70)naka=i

stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ

DEM.PROX.PL.AN‘these men who are standing at the airstrip’
Now, it is not necessarily straightforward that an expression, such as in (70),
should be analysed as one clause with an overt subject noun phrase naka=i as
opposed to another theoretically possible analysis which breaks this
expression down into a nominal head nakai and an embedded postnominal
relative clause balubib y mâa’blib li.
There is prosodic and syntactic evidence that (70) is indeed a full clause
and not a head noun followed by a postnominal relative clause. Prosodically,
the whole string is one intonational unit, set off from the rest of the matrix
clause by a short pause. Hence, phonological evidence points towards an
analysis of head-internal relatives as single clauses.
Syntactic evidence comes from the simple fact that any head-internal
relative clause can have the constituent order which one would expect if they
were independent declarative sentences. Consider the following two headinternal relative clauses in (71) and (72):
(71)[naka=i] SBJ

Not only do head-internal relative clauses display regular clausal syntax, i.e.
SV in intransitive clauses (71) and AOV in transitive ones (72), but the latter
example shows especially well that the head noun, here being the object,
occurs in its normal position within the clause and that it is not the case that
the head noun is followed by a postnominal relative clause.
Further evidence against an analysis which assumes postnominal relative
clauses comes from chained relative clauses with different overt subject noun
phrases. Consider (73):
(73)imak-wal
husband-PLbl-Ø-ib=a

‘they (the Telefol women) told the(ir) husbands and brothers who

[Mianmin and Telefomin]
In the face of this example, it would be very difficult to argue that the
utterance imak-wal bliba nakamîn-wal blibi is anything but a chain of two
clauses each with its own overt subject noun phrase, where the first clause has
a medial verb (bliba) and the second a final verb (blib) with the article =i.
Although chained clauses with medial verbs are dependent on the final verb in
the last clause of the chain regarding certain morphosyntactic information,
clause chains are essentially coordinate and not subordinate or embedded
structures.
There are, however, cases which prima facie conflict with the analysis that
head-internal relative clauses are single clauses rather than a head noun13.3. Relative clauses513followed by a postnominal relative clause. If the object is relativized and the

relative clause, it would not conform to normal clausal syntax. There are two
ways out of this situation.
First, one could assume embedding for this special case and say that in
(74) a nominal antecedent naka=e is followed by an embedded postnominal
relative clause n a-têm’-Ø-i=e. Clearly this is unsatisfactory because (a)
under such an analysis only examples like (74) would involve embedding
whereas for all other cases there is no evidence for a postnominal embedded
relative clause at all. Such a solution makes the analysis of head-internal
relatives unnecessarily complicated. After all, head-internal relative clauses,
whether they conform to basic constituent order in declarative sentences or
whether they are deviant in that respect, are formally marked in the same way.
The second option is to assume that head-internal relative clauses are
single clauses, the corollary being that they can differ from simple declarative
sentences in that they are allowed to display a constituent order unattested in
simple declarative sentences.
This is clearly the way to go in the analysis of Mian. In discussing headinternal relatives (which he calls “zirkumnominal”, i.e. circum-nominal),
Lehmann (1984) proposes a distinction between a variant with a stationary
nucleus (i.e. unbewegter Nucleus) as opposed to a variant with a preposed
nucleus (i.e. vorangestellter Nucleus). On the issue of the head position in
head-internal relative clauses also see Basilico (1996). Languages which have
head-internal relative clauses can show both variants. Diegueño, for example,
usually has stationary nuclei but allows preposed ones as a secondary strategy51413. Embedding(Gorbet 1973). We find a similar situation in Mian. Stationary nuclei are the
norm but under special circumstances when an overt pronoun is involved and
the object is relativized, as in example (74) above, the preposed-nucleus
strategy is consistently chosen.","[537, 538, 539, 540]"
"IntroductionMian, like the closely related Ok languages Telefol and Tifal, has a category
‘gender’, i.e. nouns are lexically specified for the gender they are assigned to
and require the agreement patterns associated with their gender (Corbett 1991,
Aikhenvald 2000). Mian has four genders: Masculine (M), feminine (F), neuter
1 (N1), and neuter 2 (N2).
Although gender is a nominal category, gender distinctions surface as
formal variation on agreeing categories, the agreement targets, which are
different from the noun. In Mian, agreeing categories within the noun phrase
are articles and determiners. Outside the noun phrase, pronominal affixes on
the verb, i.e. subject, object, and recipient markers, agree in gender with any
overtly realized arguments. In anaphoric agreement, pronouns and pronominal
affixes also agree in gender with a noun in a previously mentioned overt noun
phrase argument.
Mian does not mark gender overtly on the noun, i.e. there is no nominal
affix indicating the gender of a noun. I follow Corbett (1991: ch. 6), who
treats genders as formally defined by sets of agreement markers and not by
formal properties of the noun. In order to be able to say that a language has
gender, some formal marker has to be present on at least one category
different from the noun, which systematically covaries with the gender of the
noun (Corbett 1991: 105).",[195]

"PolaritySyncretism of forms across features is called ‘polarity’. In the Mian case, we
are dealing with (partial) gender polarity, i.e. for (countable) inanimates a
change in number means a change to an agreement pattern associated with a
different gender, e.g. imen ‘taro’ in the plural shows the same agreement
patterns as singular feminine nouns. The term ‘polarity’ refers to situations in
which in a “given system of two terms (grammatical features) and two
exponents, values and exponents can be inverted.” (Lecarme 2002: 110).
For a (two-class) gender system this means that any given noun has a
certain gender in the singular with concomitant agreement patterning whereas
in the plural the same noun is used with the agreement patterns of the other
gender (as used in the singular). Polarity systems have been reported for
Cushitic languages, e.g. Somali (Serzisko 1982, Saeed 1999). The agreement
pattern of the definite article in Somali are set out in table 4.7 (from Saeed
1999: 112).
Table 4.7. Definite article in Somali
Masculine
FeminineSingular
-ka
-taPlural
-ta
-ka1824. GenderIn the Somali polarity system, there are two categories, gender and number,
and two markers, -ka and -ta. Changing the value of one of the categories
causes the marker to change, whereas the marker remains the same if both
values are changed (Corbett 1991: 196). Such systems of full or genuine
polarity are comparatively scarce.
Systems of ‘partial polarity’ are less rare and can, for example, be found in
Serbo-Croat. Table 4.8 illustrates agreement patterns of the predicate
agreement marker (Corbett 1991: 197).

aFeminine and neuter are in a relation of partial polarity in Serbo-Croat because
the feminine singular form is identical to the neuter plural form (meaning that
agreement is marked following the pattern for the feminine singular), whereas
the neuter singular and feminine plural forms are not identical. This situation
is similar to what we find in Mian.
The important point is that the four-gender and the two-gender analysis for
Mian make profoundly different assumptions about what polarity actually is.
For the four-gender analysis, polarity is a descriptive term for a situation in
which a noun in the plural follows the agreement pattern associated with
another gender in the singular without assuming that the gender of the noun
actually changes with a change in number, thus creating a special form of
syncretism which cross-cuts features. Corbett (1991: 196) uses the term in this
sense. For Mian, this means that we analyse four genders and state that
feminine and neuter 1 are in a relation of partial polarity with each other (table
4.9).

am ‘house’In Mian, as in Serbo-Croat, polarity is only partial because the feminine
singular form is identical to the neuter 1 plural form, while the neuter 1
singular form is not identical to the feminine plural form.","[207, 208]"
"Head-internal relative clausesUnlike prenominal relative clauses, in which the head noun is only referred to
by pronominal marking on the verb but occurs outside the clause (as its head),
in head-internal relative clauses the head noun is usually expressed overtly
within the clause but no mention of it must be made outside the clause.
Head-internal relative clauses are obligatorily marked with a range of
pronominal determiners, among them the article, all of which are also used to
mark non-relativized noun phrases. Thus, they essentially function as noun
phrases occupying the argument position the head noun of the relative clause
has in the matrix clause. A head-internal relative clause can function within
the matrix clause as the subject, the object, the possessor, or the only argument
in a non-verbal clause. Consider example (51), in which a head-internal
relative clause functions as the object of the main clause:
(51)naka=i
man=PL.ANbalubib=y
airstrip=atmâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i
stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=PL.AN13.3. Relative clauses505ya-temê’-b-i=be
PL.AN.O-see.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
‘I am looking at the men who are standing at the airstrip’
In this example sentence, the whole head-internal relative clause nakai
balubib y mâa’blibi bears the article =i ‘plural animate’ identical to the one
which marks the subject noun phrase nakai ‘the men’.
It is common for relative clauses (and subordinate clauses in general) in
Papuan languages to behave morphologically like definite noun phrases
(Foley 1986: 202-204). This similarity in form is parallel to their similarity in
function as definite referring expressions: “Definite noun phrases presuppose
the prior identification of their referent […]. Subordinate clauses presuppose
the prior identification of the events they describe” (p. 202).
Head-internal relative clauses are marked with those pronominal elements
that are also used to mark nouns. In normal non-relativized noun phrases, an
article or some other determiner has to occur if the noun phrase is definite (or
indefinite) referential and is left out if the noun phrase is indefinite nonreferential. Likewise, head-internal relative clauses always have to have a
determiner, e.g. an article, precisely because they are definite referring
expressions.
Sometimes the article at the right edge of the head-internal relative clause
does not show on the surface. This is the case when the verb of the relative
clause ends in a vowel identical to the article, as in (52):
(52)naka=e
man=SG.Mbalubib=y
airstrip=atmâa’-bi-Ø-e=e
stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=SG.M
‘the man who is standing at the airstrip’
In this example, the article =e coalesces with the subject suffix -e because
they are identical consecutive vowels. The result is a single vowel. Thus, the
verb is pronounced [ma..]. I assume that the article in example (52) is
present underlyingly, rather than claim that some head-internal relative clauses
do not have articles and thereby obscuring the important syntactic distinction
of head-internal relatives from prenominal relative clauses (see 13.3.1), which
never have a determiner.
In head-internal relative clauses the following positions can be relativized:
subject (51) above, prefixed object of a transitive clause (53), non-indexed
object (54), prefixed object (theme) of a ditransitive clause (55), and suffixed
object (recipient) of a ditransitive clause (56).","[530, 531]"
"Properties common to all nounsSuprasegmentally, all nouns are lexically specified for one out of five tonal
melodies (i.e. L, H, LH, LHL, and HL), whose domain is the prosodic word as
a whole. Nouns with a complex tonal melody (i.e. LH, LHL, and HL) also
have one accent which is the association point for the tonal melody.
Nominal morphology is essentially non-existent, the only suffix being the
pluralizer -wal, which is restricted to proper names and kin nouns (see 3.1.7),
and dyads (see 3.1.8).
Nouns do not mark number. The only exceptions are two irregular plural
stems: (i) mn ‘child’ vs. memé ‘children’ and (ii) the bound noun stems -sak
‘resident of’ vs. -sel ‘residents of’, which only occur as second members in
compounds. Number distinctions (singular vs. plural) in noun phrases are
marked on the article (see 3.3 below), the demonstrative, on other adnominal
determiners and also show up on pronominal affixes on the verb.
Most nouns are assigned to one of four genders: Masculine (M), feminine
(F), neuter 1 (N1), and neuter 2 (N2). Some nouns undergo cross-classification
and can appear with the agreement patterns of several genders (mostly either
masculine or feminine), depending on salient semantic features of the referent.
Gender is not marked overtly on the noun itself. Agreement targets for gender
are all determiners and the verbal pronominal affixes (On gender, see chapter
4).
Case is not marked morphologically on nouns, nor by adpositions. Rather,
verbal affixes indicate grammatical relations in a clause.
Most nouns do not reduplicate productively (but see dyads below). There
are some lexicalized noun reduplications, such as bokoubokou ‘Stephanie’s
astrapia (sc. Astrapia stephaniae)’, sokousokôu ‘insect sp.’, dingding ‘taro
rhizome’, afilfil ‘twins’, kimkm ‘root’, kubkub ‘down (of a bird)’, or skosk
‘knot in wood’. At least synchronically, all of these lack non-reduplicated
counterparts (with the possible exception of kim ‘ground’). This is typical of
Ok languages in general (Healey 1964a: 64).
Nouns function as heads of noun phrases. They can be preceded by a
possessor or a prenominal (embedded) relative clause and followed by
adjectival modifiers, or a numeral. The rightmost position in any noun phrase
is occupied by a pronominal element from one of the pronoun series or a clitic
pronominal article. These pronominal elements indicate number, gender, and
referentiality of the noun. Cliticized article and noun form one phonological3.1. Nouns87word for the purpose of tone assignment. On the syntactic structure of the
noun phrase, see chapter 6.
Within the clause, noun phrases function as overt core arguments and
possessors. Apart from these core functions, nouns can be locative adjuncts of
intransitive verbs of motion. Noun phrases can function as the predicate in
non-verbal clauses (see 9.11).","[112, 113]"
"Topic-only questionsTopic-only questions are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is given,
as in English What about John? or And you? The speaker has a particular
question in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied
question is, normally something that would have been asked immediately
before about a different discourse participant or something that was
anticipated by a statement, such as I’m going. What about you? (Implied: Are
you going as well?). In Mian topic-only questions are formed by using a free
pronoun or noun phrase and the low-toned topic clitic =le. In the examples
below, possible implied questions are given in brackets. If context is lacking
the default interpretation of a topic-only question would be about the topic’s
whereabouts:
(58)bo=le?
2SG.F=TOP
‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
‘What do you want to eat?’)10.3. Topic-only questions(59)403=le?
3SG.F=TOP
‘What about Leoni?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Leoni doing?’,
‘Where is Leoni?’)
LeoniPNTopic-only questions are a special case because they do not display any of the
usual strategies to mark an utterance as a question in Mian. As can be seen
from the two examples above, there are no interrogative words nor do any
interrogative particles occur.
I assume that there are two reasons why (58) and (59) are readily
interpreted as topic-only questions though they do not bear any of the markers
typical of questions in Mian: (a) they have their own distinctive intonational
contour, namely a level high pitch on the topic marker =le which is almost as
high as the H on the preceding vowel and (b) as a matter of convention, any
utterance of the structure NP=TOP is interpreted as a topic-only question.","[428, 429]"
"269Object suffix (indirective alignment)Recipients are marked on the ditransitive verbs -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ and -ka‘give (IPFV)’ with a suffix. Both belong to the class of verbs which
obligatorily cross-reference and classify the theme object, i.e. the gift, with a
classificatory prefix. In addition, they also take a suffix that cross-references
the recipient (plus another suffix for the subject). While many Papuan
languages display secundative alignment for the recipient in ditransitives, they
treat the recipient like the object of a monotransitive verb, the alignment for
the recipient argument in Mian is indirective, i.e. recipients are marked
different from objects of monotransitive verbs.
Thus, -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ and -ka- ‘give (IPFV)’ are examples of triple
agreement, i.e. the indexing of subject and two objects by affixes on the verb.
Triple agreement is a typologically rare phenomenon, both in Papuan
languages and world-wide .
An example of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is provided in (72):
(72)n
1SGnaka=e
man=SG.Méil=o
pig=SG.Fom-ûb’-a-Ø-i-bio=be
3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=DECL
‘I gave the sow to the man.’
As in transitive clauses, none of the overt arguments n ‘I’, naka=e ‘the man’,
or éil=o ‘the sow’ in this example are marked for their syntactic role within
the clause. Construal of grammatical roles proceeds by aligning the overt noun
phrases with the agreeing pronominal affixes on the verb. In this case, n ‘I’ is
the subject because -i ‘first person singular subject’ is in the subject slot of the
verb, and the noun phrases naka=e ‘the man’ and éil=o ‘the sow’ appear in a
double object construction. Each object is indexed in a different way on the
verb, naka=e ‘the man’ as the recipient object and éil=o ‘the sow’ as the
theme object.
Like subject marking, recipient marking is suffixal and it is likewise
obligatory. Unlike subject and object marking, however, recipient marking is
sensitive to whether the marking suffix occurs in imperfective or perfective
verb forms (see below). The set of recipient suffixes occurring with -ûb’‘give (PFV)’ is summarized in table 8.4. Grey areas indicate the neutralization
of a gender contrast. For ease of exposition, only the ûb-paradigm, i.e. the
suffixes following -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’, is given here. Further below these forms
are contrasted with the forms from the ka-paradigm, used in the imperfective.
Recipient arguments of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ are always animate.",[295]
"Synopsis of pronounsThis is a synopsis of all pronominal forms in Mian. All of these can be used

Semantically, the two interrogative words divide the world up into animates
(wan ‘who’), on the one hand, and inanimates and adverbials (fàb ‘where,
what’), on the other. Interrogative words do not encode the categories number
and gender. They do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites. Both wan and fàb can be used pronominally and adnominally. For
details on the form and the use of wan and fàb, see section 10.2 on
interrogative words and the formation of content question.","[164, 165]"
"SubjectMorphologically, the grammatical relation of subject is indexed on the verb by

Syntactically, the subject is the noun phrase which matches the person,
number, and in the third person also the gender value of the subject index on
the verb, in (212) haleb ta ‘the wild boar’. The subject noun phrase is not
overtly case-marked. The subject has special syntactic status in Mian because
it is the pivot of the switch-reference system of the language. Semantically,
subjects are typically topics and agents but subjects can also be experiencers
or expletives (i.e. dummy subjects in impersonal verbs). Subject suffixes are
discussed in 8.5.2.",[189]

"PronounsMian has a range of different pronoun series distinguished by suffixal
pronominal morphology. There are one free and two bound pronoun series.
The latter two are bound in the sense that they are obligatorily inflected with a
suffix. Free and bound forms show an obvious formal relatedness. A freebound distinction in the pronoun system is typical for the Mountain Ok
languages (Healey 1964a). In Mian, the free series is used for the (free)
personal pronoun and the two bound series for all complex, i.e. suffixed,
pronouns. The possessive pronoun (see 3.7.2) is formally identical to the
bound series but is realized as an independent, i.e. non-bound, phonological
word.1 Pronouns can be used referentially and anaphorically. Many pronoun
series can also be used adnominally (Himmelmann 1997: 215-218) and appear
in the rightmost slot of the noun phrase.",[150]
"1103. Word classes and grammatical relationsArticles are enclitics which also indicates the number of the noun phrase and,
in the singular, the gender of the noun. Articles are usually toneless (see
below) and receive their tonal specification from the host they encliticize to.
The forms of the article are given in table 3.2.

The formatives under discussion are articles rather than overt number/gender
markers because they also indicate referentiality. The noun without the article
occurs in contexts in which the noun is used non-referentially, that is in any of
the following contexts:
--in the citation form, e.g. nakamîn ‘man, brother’, éil ‘pig’, imen ‘taro’,
sók ‘rain’, kukub ‘way, custom’.
in generic object arguments in the citation form of (some) transitive
verbs, e.g. as hakalin [wood break.IPFV.VN] ‘(activity of) breaking
wood’
in first elements in N-N compounds, e.g. wan-am [bird-house] ‘bird
blind’
in generic terms used to classify animals and plants, e.g. wan ‘bird’ in
wan tolim [bird eagle] ‘New Guinea eagle (sc. Harpyopsis
novaeguineae)’3.3. Articles-111in non-verbal predications about identity, e.g. tíl=o=be
[dog=PRD=DECL] ‘it’s a dog’
under negation, e.g. imen bl-im [taro exist-NEG] ‘there’s no taro’,
yi=ba=be [wound=NEG=DECL] ‘it’s not a wound’This suggests that the article does not behave like overt gender or noun class
markers in many Australian or Bantu languages, in which a noun either
invariably has a certain marker or invariably lacks it, but rather functions as an
article marking the noun as definite-referential or indefinite-referential but is
left out if the noun is used non-referentially. However, there is a tendency to
leave out the article if the noun is inanimate even if it is used referentially.
Mian does not mark its nouns overtly for gender but rather requires the
article to agree in gender with its noun. There is evidence that the article is on
the way of becoming a purely classificatory gender marker through the
extension of the form with article to non-referential contexts. Although the
form without article is the preferred choice under negation, as in
as bl-im [wood exist-NEG] ‘there’s no wood’, one also finds as=e bl-im
[wood=ARTICLE exist-NEG] with the same meaning. Greenberg (1978) shows
that across languages the definite article often winds up as a gender marker on
the noun after going through a grammaticalization process during which it is
increasingly used both as a definite article, meaning ‘the N’, and an indefinite
specific article, meaning ‘a specific N’ or ‘a certain N’. When the use of the
article becomes a function of the syntactic construction in which the noun
appears (e.g. negation), the original contrast between the form with article and
the form without article is lost and the distinction becomes redundant. At this
point the form with article usually starts to spread to all contexts. If this form
becomes universal in the language, the former article has become a gender
marker on the noun (Greenberg 1978: 63).
Articles can follow all nouns, i.e. common nouns, proper names, dyads,
and temporal and verbal nouns (see section 3.1). Articles can also follow finite
verbs in head-internal relative clauses and adverbial clauses. In head-internal
relative clauses (61), the article agrees in number and gender with the noun. In
adverbials (62), the article is invariably =o. Square brackets indicate clause
boundaries:

Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses are discussed in 13.2 and
13.3 under embedding.
Articles can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and follow the noun
and any adjectival modifiers. They can also follow numerals (see 6.3 for
details on modified and quantified noun phrases):
(63)tíl=e
milil=e
black=SG.M
dog=SG.M
‘a/the big, black dog’sm=e
big=SG.MIn (63), referentiality, number and gender are marked per article =e on the
noun and on each adjectival modifier. More common in natural discourse,
however, is to have only one article for the whole noun phrase, namely
following the rightmost modifier, for example:
(64)tíl
milil
sm=e
dog black
big=SG.M
‘a/the big, black dog’I analyse the article as a clitic rather than a suffix for the following reasons:
(a) Apart from nouns, articles can attach to adjectives and numerals and also
to verbs in adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses. (b) The
coordinating clitic =a (presumably a shortened form of eka ‘and’) usually
intervenes between the noun and the article in the last constituent of a
sequence of coordinate noun phrases:
(65)naka=i=a
unáng=a=i
woman=and=PL.AN
man=PL.AN=and
‘(the) men and women’ [Dimosson]Articles are segmentally identical to the third person forms of the free
pronouns series, from which they are probably derived. Synchronically,
however, they differ from the pronouns in their suprasegmentals. While all
free pronoun forms are lexically specified for a high tone, articles are subject3.3. Articles113to suprasegmental phonological erosion, i.e. they are on the way to becoming
toneless. As lexical tone spreads to any toneless affixes and clitics, the
phonetic pitch value of the article depends on the lexical tone specification of
the noun (see 2.8.3.2).
I assume three stages in this grammaticalization scenario. Contemporary
Mian is moving from stage (b) to stage (c):
(66)(a) naka  (lit. ‘man he’) > (b) naka= > (c) naka-e ‘a/the man’In the first stage (a), nouns were followed by a free pronoun which was
realized as a phonologically independent word. Synchronically, articles are
generally not realized as independent phonological words anymore, although
this still happens occasionally in very old speakers (over 80 years).
In the second stage (b), the article encliticizes to the noun. Concomitantly,
suprasegmental attrition sets in.
At the final stage (c), the vocalic formative will have developed into a
toneless nominal suffix.
As the article is part of the phonological nominal word (even in very
careful speech), it is clear that the language has moved beyond the first stage.
However, one finds the pronunciations [na.ka. ] and [na.ka.] ‘a/the man’. In
the former, the article has its own high tone, in the latter it is toneless and low
tone is spread from the noun to the article. Articles which retain their own
high tone (characteristic of the second stage) and ones which are toneless
(characteristic of the third stage) occur in free variation.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"
"The free pronoun seriesFree personal pronouns, which are used to refer to animates vary according to
person (first, second, or third), number (singular or plural), and in the second
and third person singular, gender (masculine or feminine). In the first person
plural there is an inclusive-exclusive distinction, which other Mountain Ok
languages lack, but which can be found in the Lowland Ok language3.7. Pronouns125Ninggerum. The first person plural inclusive form nbo ‘we (INCL)’ was
probably formed by compounding n ‘we (EXCL) and bo ‘you (PL)’.
Table 3.3 shows the free personal pronouns for animates. As gender
distinctions in third person pronouns referring to inanimates are slightly more
involved, they will be dealt with in a separate table below. Grey areas indicate
the absence of a gender contrast.

‘they’Within the set of free pronouns, there are some obvious correspondences
between segments and meanings: /n/ only occurs in the first person forms, /k/
only occurs in the second singular masculine form, /i/ appears in all plural
forms, // and /o/ mark masculine and feminine gender, respectively, all third
person pronouns just consist of a single vowel carrying a high tone, and /b/
refers to the second person. the pronouns have the typical TNG reflexes /n/
(first person), /k/ (second person) and /i/ (third person non-singular) (Foley
2000: 362, Ross 2005: 32).
For animate pronouns, there is a gender distinction in the second and third
person singular depending on the sex of the referent. Gender distinctions for
inanimates are more complicated because forms in different genders and
numbers show considerable homophony (see 4.6).
Table 3.4 gives the particulars for the third person pronouns for inanimates.
The grey area indicates the absence of a number contrast in neuter 2.

"Neuter 2Figure 5.1. Overlap between genders and prefix classes (in the third person)A system of classificatory verbal prefixes has been described for the Papuan
language Waris by Brown (1981). Seiler (1983) argues that first elements in
former verb-verb compounds were reanalysed as classificatory prefixes. On a5.2. The M-class: dob-/dol-189similar phenomenon in the Papuan language Imonda, see Seiler (1985). The
etymology of the Waris classificatory prefixes is still transparent in many
cases because the verbal etymons of the classificatory prefixes continue to be
used as independent verbs, as shown in table 5.4.

prefixes is synchronically impossible to determine. With the exception of
gam- ‘covering object singular’, none of the other classificatory prefixes can
synchronically be traced back to any lexical category, verb or otherwise. The
prefix gam- is possibly related to the noun suffix -gam ‘covered with’ (cf.
3.1.5):
(8)kl-gam
ringworm-covered
‘covered with ringworm’To sum up, the reanalysis scenario developed by Seiler probably does not
apply to Mian or is an older phenomenon than in Waris or Imonda.","[214, 215]"
"Noun phrase topicalizationTopic-marking in Mian is done with the topic clitic =le which attaches to
noun phrases, including free pronouns. I analyse =le as a clitic rather than an
affix because it not only attaches to pronouns but can mark topical adverbial
clauses and medial clauses in clause chains as well. Topical constituents with
=le are intonationally detached from the following clause.
Topic marking with =le is incompatible with emphatic pronouns, which
are used for focus (see 6.10), e.g. *-ta=le [3SG.M-EMPH=TOP].
Topic-only question are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is
mentioned. The speaker has a particular question in mind, and it must be
obvious from the context what the implied question is, such as I’m going. And
you? (Implied: Are you going as well?). Two examples are given below:
(94)kbo=le?
2SG.M=TOP
‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
‘What do you want to eat?’)(95)=le?
3SG.M=TOP
‘What about Milsen?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Milsen doing?’
‘Where is Milsen?’)

1SG-EMPH=QUOT

‘ “As for me, Dabein that’s me.” ’ [Dimosson]Subjects can be topicalized with =le, as in the following excerpts from an
account of traditional initiation, where the topic is given:2306. The noun phrase(97)[...] ‘Adults would line the side of the path. Others (also adults)
would lead the boys who are to be initiated, and they (i.e. the boys)

[Initiation rituals]
This bit of discourse contains two groups of adults, as opposed to the boys,
one group lining the path, the other leading the boys. The topic pronoun is
here used to establish the first group of adults as the topic of the new clause.
Topics are typically given information but this is not necessarily the case,
as in the following example where an object is topicalized which has not been
previously mentioned in the discourse:

Multiple topicalized constituents can often be found as discourse openers (de

general topic of the whole narrative, set up here as a discourse frame by the
speaker:

"Position of nominal adjunctsIn most cases, nominal adjuncts occur immediately before the verb. An
example of a nominal adjunct is provided in (113). Others can be found in
section 8.10.
(113) le
DEM.PROX.SG.N1fetàng
carrion_smellkun-b-e=be
emanate_smell.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘This smells putrid.’
The element fetàng ‘carrion smell’ is a regular compound consisting of fè
‘carrion’ and tang ‘smell’, yet is not an object noun phrase in this case but
rather a nominal adjunct to the verb. In Mian, objects can be followed by an
article or other pronominal determiner, they can be modified by a relative
clause and be topicalized. But a nominal adjunct like fetàng in (113) always
has to occur before the verb kun smell cannot be followed by any determiner.
Nor do they allow relativization or topicaliztion. Occasionally, nominal
adjuncts occur modified by an adjective, e.g. abén sm ‘big laughter’.",[395]
"Prenominal relative clausesPrenominal relative clauses are clausal modifiers embedded into the noun
phrase. They always precede their head noun, e.g. in (36), where the subject is
relativized:
(36)balubib=y
airstrip=atmâa’-bl-Ø-ib
stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJnaka=i
man=PL.AN
‘the men who are standing at the airstrip’
Here, a clause balubib=y mâa’blib ‘they are standing at the airstrip’ precedes
its head noun naka=i ‘the men’. Postcedent identification is made possible by
both the morphology and the syntax. While the syntax dictates that the noun
following the relative clause is the head noun, there is additional information
from agreement in the pronominal marking on the verb. In (36) above, for
example, the verb mâa’blib ‘they are standing’ is marked -ib agreeing with the
postcedent in the (animate) plural.
With prenominal relative clauses, the head noun must not be left out.
Hence, example (37) is ungrammatical:13.3. Relative clauses(37)*balubib=y

Intended: ‘I’m looking at them who are standing at the airstrip.’
The verb in the relative clause is a final verb. It is not subject to any limits in
terms of its morphology. It can, for instance, be inflected for tense, as in (38)
or mood in (39):
(38)balubib
klâ-Ø-ib-bio

‘the house in which they will initiate’ [Initiation rites]The head noun is only allowed to appear in a reduced form in the relative
clause itself, namely as a cross-referencing affix on the verb. Under no
circumstances can a prenominal relative clause have an overt noun phrase,
either a full noun phrase (40) or a free pronoun (41), co-referent with, and
with the same grammatical function as the head noun. This restriction is crosslinguistically common (Comrie 1981: 140):
(40)*naka=e

the postcedent becomes more obvious when we consider an example in which
the object is relativized, e.g. (42):
(42)n
a-têm’-Ø-i
3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ
1SG
‘the man whom I saw’naka=e
man=SG.MIn this case, overt repetition of the postcedent inside the relative clause also
yields an ungrammatical result: *n naka=e a-têm’-i naka=e.
This shows that prenominal relative clauses are prone to a restriction which
is irrelevant in simple declarative sentences (or in any clause in a clause chain,
for that matter), where an overt object noun phrase, such as naka=e, can
always occur despite the fact that it is already indexed on the verb by a prefix:

given in (46):
(46)yo-n-omab-ib
am=o
house=N2
initiate-AUX.PFV-IRR.PL.AN.SBJ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ
‘the house in which they will initiate’ [Initiation rites]The interpretation of am=o ‘the house’ as a locative is not overtly indicated in
(46) but it is the only plausible one given the semantics of the verb and the
head noun. Houses are not likely to be initiated nor are they commonly
beneficiaries of initiation procedures.
A noun phrase containing a prenominal relative clause can have all the
roles also available to a noun phrase which is not modified by a relative
clause, i.e. appear in subject, object, and possessor position, and as the only
argument in a non-verbal clause (47):

teke=o=be
tall=PRD=DECL

‘The man who is standing at the airstrip is tall.’
Finally, we want to determine what structure an utterance consisting of a
prenominal relative clause and its head noun has. Consider example (48):
(48)balubib=y
mâa’-bi-Ø-e
airstrip=at
stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ
‘the man who is standing at the airstrip’naka=e
man=SG.MThe clause balubib y mâa’bie ‘he was standing at the airstrip’ used as a
prenominal relative clause in (48) does not have a relative pronoun. There is
no overt marking of the clause as subordinate. Nor is there any marking which
indicates that prenominal relative clauses in Mian function as noun phrases
themselves. In Yimas (Foley 1991), relative clauses, which can precede or
follow their head noun or appear without it, usually bear the ‘near distal’
marker m-, which marks the whole relative clause as a definite referring
expression. In addition to that, Yimas relative clauses obligatorily take a class
and number suffix which marks them as noun phrases and indicates the head
noun modified by the relative clause (from Foley 1991: 413):150413. Embedding(49)kray

NR.DIST-1SG.A-kill-PFV-VI.SG
frog.VI.SG
‘the frog which I killed’The absence of any marking on the Mian prenominal relative clause suggests
that we are not dealing with a noun phrase in apposition with the head noun
here but rather with a clause embedded into the noun phrase as a modifer.
Neither do we have a clause which is clearly marked as subordinate to a
matrix clause.
Furthermore, it is not possible for a noun phrase to contain either sin ‘old’
or memâ ‘new’ in prenominal position plus a prenominal relative clause.

"Medial versus final verbsMany Papuan languages that have clause chaining and S/R systems display a
difference in morphological complexity of medial verbs compared to
sentence-final verbs, which appear as the predicate of the last clause in a
clause chain. Compared to final verbs, medial verbs are commonly
morphologically impoverished. See Roberts (1997) for a typological survey of
S/R systems in New Guinea languages.
In the simplest case, medial verbs are only marked for co-reference of
subject, not for tense or person/number of the subject. The following example
from Usan (Numugenan family, Madang Province) (Reesink 1987) is found in
Reesink (1983: 217 and pers. comm.):
(36)ye
nam
su-ab
is-omei
go_down-1SG.FAR.PAST
I
tree
cut-SS
‘I cut the tree and (I) went down.’Often the marker has additional temporal meaning, ‘portmanteau-ed’ into the
same formative, e.g. sequential or simultaneous. This is the case in Fasu (West
Kutubuan family, Southern Highlands Province) (Loeweke and May 1980)
and Kalam (Kalam family, Madang Province) (Pawley 1966, Pawley 1987,
Pawley 1993). The following example is from Kalam (Pawley 1993: 101):
(37)kwt
d-y
nwp pk-p-yn
him hit-PFV-2SG
stick
hold-SS.PRIOR
‘You hit him with a stick.’ (lit. ‘You took a stick and hit him.’)11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining423The DS-forms of medial verbs are usually more complex. They can carry a
subject marker, which indicates DS while the SS form is zero, e.g. in Fore
(Gorokan family, Eastern Highlands) (Scott 1978), or they can have an
anticipatory subject marker which indicates person and number of the
following subject, as in Hua (Gorokan family, Eastern Highlands) (Haiman
1980: 187-189).
In other languages, one finds portmanteaux DS markers, for example in
Kobon (Davies 1981) and Usan, where the DS marker also contains
information on subject person and number without this being segmentable as a
distinct morpheme. The following Usan example is from Reesink (1983: 218
and pers. comm.):
(38)ye
nam
su-ine
is-orei
go_down-3SG.FAR.PAST
I
tree
cut-1SG.DS
‘I cut the tree (and it went) down.’Medial verbs can have separate suffixes for disjoint reference and for subject
person and number, as for example in Kalam (Pawley 1993: 94):
(39)an
ag-e-k
g-a-k?
do-3SG-PST
who
say-DS.PRIOR-3SG
‘Who told him to do it?’ (lit. ‘Who said and he did it?’)So in these typical examples of S/R in Papuan languages we find a situation
where medial verbs are different from final verbs in that not all medial verbs
are marked for subject person and/or subject number (e.g. SS medial verbs
often occur without an affix cross-referencing the subject), they often cannot
be marked for various categories, such as irrealis mood or absolute tense, i.e. a
tense category which has the moment of speaking as its deictic centre (Comrie
1985), and the formatives that medial and final verbs allow are formally and
functionally distinct.
In Mian we find a less grammaticalized S/R system, characteristic of
languages of the West Papuan Highlands, e.g. Dani (Bromley 1981) and
Kapauku (Ekagi) (William Foley, pers. comm.). Mian also makes frequent use
of clause chaining in discourse, but here the situation is different in that
medial verbs resemble final verbs much more than in the languages above.

"The possessive pronouns with nominal functionPronominal roots from either bound series can be suffixed with -mi to form
the possessive pronoun with nominal function, e.g. n-mi ‘mine’ (from the

kleb-mi ‘yours alone’ (from the ‘alone’-series). Table 3.13 lists all forms.

"IntroductionThe Mian verb is by far the most morphologically complex category in the
language. Many verbs formally distinguish a perfective and an imperfective
stem, which are used to express bounded and unbounded events, respectively.
Aspectual stem distinctions are a typical feature of the Mountain Ok
languages (Healey 1964a: 68). They can also be found in other Papuan
languages, e.g. Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and Abui (Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86).
Mian is mildly polysynthetic in that all finite verbs obligatorily index their
subject and the recipient object, if a recipient is part of the verb’s argument
structure. A subset of verbs also marks their objects. All argument affixes are
pronominal in nature, i.e. they are not pure agreement affixes. They crossreference overt argument noun phrases, which can be freely elided. Argument
affixes agree with overt argument noun phrases in person, number and gender.
If the argument noun phrase is elided, argument affixes agree anaphorically.
The verb has two slots for tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, one on either
side of the subject suffix slot. The pre-subject slot accommodates a range of
tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, whereas the post-subject slot is filled only by
tense suffixes. The fillers of the post-subject slot are probably more recent
grammaticalizations from erstwhile auxiliary constructions, in which an
inflected auxiliary has been reanalysed as a tense suffix.
Verbs are inflected directly for certain TAM combinations. Direct
inflection here means that the TAM suffix is appended directly to the verb
stem. A serialization of a lexical verb stem with a form of the existential verb
is required for other TAM combinations. In this case the TAM suffix is
appended to the existential verb.
It is typical for verbs in many Papuan languages to be marked for
illocutionary force (Foley 1986: 164). Mian has several sentential clitic
particles which attach to the verb to signal the illocutionary force of an
utterance as declarative or quotative, as a question, or as hortative.
Mian verbs productively form serial verb constructions. Verb serialization
is discussed in section 11.1 under chaining.",[269]
"The negative clitic =moThe negative clitic =mo is used in clauses that are negated with =ba ‘negation’
and prohibitives (see 8.6.7.6). It cannot be used in negated non-verbal
predications. =Mo typically encliticizes to the final constituent before the
verb. It can occur as a free word clause-initially. Examples of =mo in
declaratives can be found in 3.13.3 above. An example of the prohibitive is
given in (201):

‘Do not keep turning him (a male child) around!’ [Crows]
If the negated verb consists of a coverb and a function verb in case of a
function-verb construction, =mo attaches to the final constituent before the
whole predicate, which includes the coverb accompanying a function verb. An
example is:1603. Word classes and grammatical relations(202) n

"Introduction and terminologySwitch reference (S/R) is a discourse tracking device, whose main function is
to monitor the subject (S/R pivot), i.e. to indicate through verbal morphology
whether the subject of an adjacent clause is identical to or different from the
subject of the present clause.
Some have termed S/R systems ‘exotic’ mainly because the combination of
formal and functional properties found in S/R systems suggests a violation of
the Principal of Categorial Iconicity (Haiman 1985), which postulates that a
distinction is normally marked on the category to which it applies
semantically. However, as pointed out by Stirling (1993: 137), S/R systems
commonly combine reference tracking with other functions, such as indicating
more generally a continuity or discontinuity between clauses (also see Comrie
(1983: 23)). Hence, S/R systems provide information about relations between
whole clauses, not just about the pivot noun phrases. If conceived of as a
multi-functional system of agreement with the clause as its semantic domain,
it does not come as a surprise that S/R distinctions are marked on the head of
the clause, namely the verb, especially since S/R languages tend to be headmarking. Apart from this difference in the locus of marking, there is no
principled difference between S/R and other means of tracking the reference
of participants in discourse, such as anaphoric pronouns, gender systems, and
other systems of nominal classification. For a detailed discussion of these
issues, see Stirling (1993: 135-147).
In Papuan languages, S/R marking usually occurs in clause chaining
constructions (Longacre 1972, Foley and Van Valin 1984, Foley 1986, Foley
2000, Roberts 1997). Any two adjacent clauses in such chains form a pair
consisting of a ‘marked’ clause and a ‘reference’ clause. In adopting this
terminology I follow Farr (1999: 177-178). The marked clause is marked for
co-/disjoint reference of the subject with respect to the reference clause. These
terms hark back to a study of S/R systems by Munro (1980).",[447]
"The interrogative word wantl-Ø-eb-bu=e?
come.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ-GPST=CQThe interrogative word wan ‘who’ is used to inquire about the identity of
animates including their names.
There are four variants wan, un and wal, ul. The variation between /wa/
and /u/ is free and can be found in other areas of Mian grammar, e.g. in the
variation of the object agreement prefix wa- ~ u- (see 8.5.3). The variants wal
and ul have the morphophonemic variants wale and ule if the following
emphatic pronoun start in /i/, there is. Thus, the forms for the second and third
person plural are walibta/ulibta ‘who (you PL)’ and walita/ulita ‘who
(they)’, respectively.
Without an emphatic pronoun, wan only occurs in questions about
possessors. Like possessors expressed by full noun phrases, the interrogative
word wan precedes the possessed. Either the pronominal article =e in the
singular masculine form (44) or =i in the animate plural form (45) is
obligatory:10.2. Content questions(44)lewan=e

The use of the classificatory prefix dl- ‘plural animate object’ in the last

Rather it is used as a default form in content questions about the object, i.e.
when the identity of the object referent is unknown and queried. For inquiring
about inanimate objects, see section 10.2.4 on fatnàmin ‘what’ above.
The combination wan ‘who’ plus emphatic pronoun is used in a non-verbal
construction to inquire about proper names, which are important properties of
humans and some animals. Example (53) is the idiomatic way of inquiring
about a man’s name. To ask about a woman’s name wanbte has to be used.

There is one case where the interrogative phrase seemingly does not appear in

The interrogative phrase is in subject position (i.e. in situ) and the verb is

consist of a finite clause but rather of a topic-comment construction with a
head-internal relative clause in topic position, namely kàb=e klutâ-n-e =le

"Two genders: Masculine and feminine onlyGender systems are not a particularly common phenomenon in Trans New
Guinea languages and if they do occur they are usually analysed as two-class
systems with a masculine and a feminine gender (Wurm 1982: 80). The
closely related Ok language Telefol, for instance, is described by Healey
(1965a: 31-32) as having two genders (masculine and feminine).2
Furthermore, having a two-gender system is typical of the Ok languages in
general (Healey 1964a: 116).
To claim that the Mian gender system has four genders is therefore
contrary to the received opinion as to how Trans New Guinea languages, and
especially the Ok languages, classify their nominal vocabulary.
An alternative analysis with only two genders and an animate-inanimate
distinction was sketched by Foley (1986: 81). He captures the homophony in
the Mian gender agreement patterns by assigning nouns that have the e-article
to the ‘masculine’ and nouns that take the o-article to the ‘feminine’ gender.
The i-article is restricted to plural animates and shows gender syncretism.
Table 4.6 sets out the agreement patterns on the article for the two-gender
analysis.
The consequences of this analysis are (a) a fundamental difference between
animate and inanimate nouns in terms of behaviour of the categories gender
and number and (b) an intricate connection or association between gender and
number/quantity for inanimates. Animates have a gender contrast in the
singular and the plural in =i, whereas for some inanimates (the neuter 1 nouns1804. Genderin the four-gender analysis presented above) a contrast in number or quantity
is expressed by means of a contrast in gender. For all other inanimates (neuter
2 in the four-gender analysis) gender markers give no indication of number.

imen ‘taro’, am ‘house’The analysis suggested by Foley is of course based on the description of Mian
gender found in Smith and Weston (1974b). As far as the formative /o/ is
concerned, Smith and Weston only use the term ‘feminine’ for animate nouns.
They go on to say that inanimates “are classified according to size or quantity”
(Smith and Weston 1974b: 41-42), i.e. plural inanimates (or quantities) and
nouns whose referents are considered to be of large size also take /o/, e.g.
kaawa-o ‘steel axe’, imen-o ‘large taro, quantity of taro’3 (Smith and Weston
1974b: 42).
It is well-known that size can be an assignment criterion for gender (Foley
1986, Aikhenvald 2000). So it could indeed be the case that káawa ‘steel axe’
is assigned to the feminine gender because it is treated as referring to a large
object. The noun káawa would then be subject to the rule that inanimates in
Mian do not have a plural in /i/. However, contrary to Smith and Weston’s
claims I cannot confirm that this assignment strategy has any relevance for
large tokens of some types of objects that come in all shapes and sizes, like
taro tubers or string bags. My data suggests that one taro can only ever be
referred to with imen=e ‘a/the taro’ regardless of size. In order to express that
a certain taro tuber is big, a modifying adjective, e.g. sm ‘big’, has to be
used, thus imen=e sm=e ‘a/the big taro’. On the other hand, imen=o can only
mean ‘(the) taros’. Therefore, size does not seem to be a predominant
assignment criterion for inanimates in contemporary Mian.
According to Smith and Weston, the other assignment criterion for
inanimates apart from size is quantity. The gender contrast is between =e for
singular or small quantity/number and =o for plural or large quantity/number.
Although the assignment criterion “quantity” is widespread in systems of
mensural and sortal classifiers and is also attested for classificatory verbs
(Aikhenvald 2000: 293, 300), it does not figure predominantly in gender
systems. Yet, in Mian we have seen that for homogeneous substances, like4.6. Alternative analysis of the gender system181liquids, differences in the agreement pattern correlate with differences in
quantity, e.g. aai=e ‘some water’ vs. aai=o ‘much water’.
A similar example comes from the Papuan language Manambu, where
mass nouns are assigned to their gender (masculine or feminine) on the basis
of quantity (Aikhenvald 1998). Hence, it seems plausible to assume that in
Mian homogeneous substances are assigned to their gender on the basis of
quantity as well. However, for most inanimates, namely those which refer to
discrete objects, the contrast is clearly not between small and large quantities
(as Smith and Weston claim), but rather a contrast between one object and
more than one objects, in other words, a contrast in number. Thus, an
inanimate noun with =e can only refer to a single entity, e.g. imen=e ‘a/the
taro’ / *‘a small amount of taro’.4
A two-gender analysis for Mian entails that the feminine gender contains –
apart from female animates – also plural inanimates, such as imen=o ‘(the)
taros’, large quantities of substances, such as aai=o ‘much water’, and
inanimates for which there is no singular-plural distinction, such as am=o
‘(the) house(s)’ and káawa=o ‘(the) steel axe(s)’.","[205, 206, 207]"
"Noun phrases as locative adjunctsThe target of the movement encoded by motion verbs is often just realized as a
noun phrase, in case of locations or places the noun appears without a
determiner. Noun phrases as locative adjuncts are never obligatory. In (13),
movement is towards a location, and in (14), it is towards a person:

semantic roles these are always locatives. The main syntactic difference is that
objects are relativizable while locative adjuncts are not. Also there is a strong
tendency for all adjuncts to directly precede the verb, while objects of
transitive verbs are more mobile within the clause. Hence, I analyse locative
noun phrases as (locative) adjuncts of intransitive motion verbs rather than
core arguments (i.e. the objects) of what then would be a transitive motion
verb.","[363, 364]"
"DyadsDyadic terms (Evans 2003a, 2006) refer to a social or a kin relationship
between two or more people and encode relational opposites. There is some
marginal metaphorical extension to relations between inanimates. Mian has
five dyadic lexemes, which are given in (20):
(20)dum
hat
mikim
dab
kam‘father and child (of either sex)’
‘mother and child (of either sex)’
‘siblings of opposite sex’
‘siblings of same sex’
‘(married) couple’963. Word classes and grammatical relationsFormally, dyadic terms are closest to nouns. They can appear as arguments of
a verb and they appear with an article, which is preferably the collective
article =o, but =i ‘animate plural’ is also possible:

the notable exception of kin nouns. Finally, the semantics of dyads and nouns
are different since dyads refer to relations rather than entities.
If the dyad refers to a relation between just two individuals, it can be
inflected for plural with the plural suffix -wal:

by either a pronoun or a proper name immediately preceding the dyadic term,
i.e. in the possessor slot preceding the dyad head. Note that although the
pronoun in (25) is in the possessive form, it receives an appositive
interpretation. All dyadic terms except kam ‘married couple’ can occur with
all (animate) plural possessive pronouns with appositive meaning, e.g. n ‘our
(EXCL)’, nb ‘our (INCL)’, b ‘your’, and  ‘their’ in the possessor position. The
dyad kam can only be preceded by those of the second and third person
(animate) plural, hence *n kam and *nb kam. Why this should be the case is
unclear. Dyads never appear in phonologically eroded form.

father_child(dyad)-PL
‘Beliab and his children’ (Smith and Weston 1974b: 56)PN=SG.M3.1.8.2. mikim ‘siblings of opposite sex’ and dab ‘siblings of same sex’
The relationship denoted by mikim is one between siblings of opposite sex,
while that denoted by dab is between siblings of same sex. The reduplications
mikimwal mikimwal and dabwal dabwal are used for two or more disjoint
groups of siblings of different sex and siblings of same sex, respectively.
The dyadic terms mikim and dab can occur with a proper name instead of a
possessive pronoun in the possessor slot:
(29)Danenok
PNdab-wal=i
same_sex_sibling(dyad)-PL=PL.ANngaan-ha-biaan-ib=a
call.IPFV-3SG.M.R-AUX.IPFV.SS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
‘Danenok and his brother were calling out to him, while they…’
[Danenok]
The dyads dab and mikim are also used to refer to the relation between
grandparent and grandchild, of same and different sex, respectively.3.1.8.3. kam ‘(married) couple’
The dyadic term kam behaves slightly differently from the others because it
cannot be combined with first person pronouns, thus *n(b) kam. Use of kam3.1. Nouns99with pronouns of the second or third person (animate) plural, or with proper
names is fine, e.g. íb kamwal ‘you, and your partner’, Kaseninge kamwal
‘Kasening and his wife, Wentako kamwal ‘Wentak and her husband’.
Of the five dyads only kam ‘(married) couple’ shows some metaphorical
extension to cover a dyadic relation between inanimates. Consider the
following excerpt from a description of the traditional technique of kebweaving, where finely woven threads are tied around both tips of a bow to
hold the bowstring in place:

occur with the article =o in temporal noun phrases and are of neuter 2 gender.
The article can be left out without any change in meaning. Temporal nouns or
noun phrases usually occur immediately after the subject, but are quite mobile
within the clause.
Temporal noun phrases are:
(31)lo ‘now’
sino ‘formerly, before’
memâlo ‘today, now’
sintalo ‘yesterday’
sintalo  sintao ‘the day before yesterday’ (lit. ‘yesterday’s yesterday)

clause. Its exact analysis and glossing are:
(33)bomâ-(a)n-om-o=o
light-VBLZ-COND-EXPL.SBJ=N2
‘when it gets light’However, bomânomo shows more positional variability than other
nominalised adverbial clauses, in that it does not have to occur clause-initially.
Syntactically, bomânomo behaves like other temporal noun phrases, all of
which typically appear after an overt subject, or utterance initially, if the
subject noun phrase or pronoun is elided e.g.:

tomorrowBoutlantema
PNtaman
valleyun-aamab-i=be
go.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
‘Tomorrow I will go to the Boutlantema valley.’
Hence, I will treat bomânomo – although technically a clause – as a
lexicalized temporal noun phrase with the meaning ‘tomorrow’. The only
items with the same morphological structure in the corpus is sinangwanânomo
‘in the far future’.","[121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126]"

The forms of the ‘alone’-series are used as possessive pronouns, if one wants
to emphasize exclusive possession:

house=N2
1PL.EXCL.POSS.alone
‘our house alone’ (Smith and Weston 1974b: 47)
There are phonological and syntactic reasons for analyzing the possessive
pronoun as a non-bound form in Mian, rather than a bound form.
First, in careful speech, possessive pronouns are uttered as separate words.
Second, possessive pronouns are suprasegmentally distinct from other
bound affixal material, in that they all bear a high tone whereas bound affixal
material is unspecified for tone in Mian. Third, if the possessive pronoun
precedes a noun beginning in a voiced stop, this stop is prenasalized.
Finally, the possessive pronoun can be separated from the following noun
by the adjectives sin ‘old’, as illustrated in (108) above, and memâ ‘new’
(112):
(112) n
memâ

1SG.POSS

houseThe bound pronoun seriesMian has two bound pronoun series, i.e. two series of pronouns that have to be
further inflected to form complex pronouns. The possessive pronoun (see
3.7.2) is not a bound form in Mian but its forms are identical to the bound
series. I call the bound series the ‘simple’ and the ‘alone’ bound series.
The bound pronouns never occur as independent words. They are used as
the base to form the following five complex pronouns through suffixation:
-Emphatic pronouns with the suffix -ta (3.7.4)
Possessive pronouns with nominal function with the suffix -mi (3.7.5)
Negated pronouns with the suffix -kob (3.7.6)
Free ‘alone’ pronouns with the suffix -kiem (3.7.7)
Reflexive pronouns with the suffixes -ma(ye) or -skil (3.7.8)3.7. Pronouns129The reader will find examples of each of these under the respective headings.
The forms of the simple bound series are given in tables 3.7 and 3.8. Grey
areas indicate the absence of a gender contrast.

(Healey 1964a: 66). The forms of the ‘alone’ bound series are given in tables
3.9 and 3.10. Grey areas indicate the absence of a gender contrast.
The ‘alone’ series is obviously derived from the ‘simple’ series with the
help of the segment sequence /lV/ (where ‘V’ indicates progressive vowel
harmony), which is suffixed to the (C)V-forms, e.g. n-le- ‘I alone’, but
infixed into the (C)Vb-forms, e.g. k<le>b ‘you (M) alone’, <lo>b ‘you (F)

series as separate morphemes with the meaning ‘alone’ in glossed examples.

"QuantifiersThe class of quantifiers comprises homòn ‘many, much’, alukûm ‘all, every,
each’, and alik ‘all, every, each’, plus all numerals. Numerals and homòn
‘many, much’ always follow the noun that is being counted and all its
adjectival modifiers. The quantifiers alukûm and alik can occur before or after
the noun phrase they quantify.
Mian does not have a set of formally distinct ordinal numbers nor does it
allow the use of cardinal numbers as ordinals.
Basic numerals are:
(156) elekiêm~eleyêm
olokiêm~oloyêm
asú/asusûna
asumâtna‘one (M, N1)’
‘one (F, N2)’
‘two’
‘three’The pronouns from the free ‘alone’-series elekiêm (also eleyêm) ‘only he/it
alone’ and olokiêm (also oloyêm) ‘only she/it alone’ (see 3.7.7) double as the
numeral ‘one’, depending on gender. The numeral obligatorily agrees in
gender with the noun which is being counted:
(157) naka=e
elekiêm
one.M
man=SG.M
‘one man’ OR ‘only the man alone’
(158) unáng=o
olokiêm
one.F
woman=SG.F
‘one woman’ OR ‘only the woman alone’
The numerals asú ‘two’ and asumâtna ‘three’ can occur with an article
reflecting the number and the gender of the counted noun but are often bare.
Asú ‘two’ has a variant asusûna, which looks like a partial reduplication of the
simple numeral asú. Nonetheless, asusûna also means ‘two’ rather than ‘four’:3.10. Quantifiers(159) unáng=i
woman=PL.AN
‘two women’145asú(=ei)/asusûna(=i)
twoThe numeral asusûna ‘two’ is (at least historically) segmentable into the
(partially reduplicated) numeral asusû and na. The latter is possibly derived
from the verb na ‘do’. Thus, asusûna ‘two’ would have been a verbal
predicate meaning ‘are two (lit. ‘do two’)’. The same holds for asumâtna
’three’, which consists of asú ‘two’, mak ‘(an)other’ and na ‘do’. Hence,
asumâtna probably used to mean ‘be two and another’:
(160) unáng=i
asumâtna(=i)
three(=PL.AN)
woman=PL.AN
‘three women’ (lit. ‘two women and another’)
As the element na in numerals synchronically cannot be inflected as a verb, I
do not see any plausible reason to analyse the Mian numerals asusûna ‘two’
and asumâtna ‘three’ as verbs. I assume that the erstwhile verb stem na ‘do’ is
synchronically a part of the lexemes asusûna ‘two’ and asumâtna ‘three’.
The numerals asú ‘two’, asusûna ‘two’, and asumâtna ‘three’ can be
collocated with the function verb ke ‘do’ to express that a group consists of a
certain number of individuals:

play-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
‘They are three of them playing.’ (lit. ‘They are three and they

The numerals for numbers larger than three are phrasal. The rationale for
forming such phrasal numerals is stringing together instances of asú=ke ‘two
and’ (i.e. the numeral asú ‘two’ plus the light verb ke ‘do’ serving as a
coordinator in phrasal numerals) as many times as needed to count to an even
number and rounding this off by make ‘(one) other’ for odd numbers.
Examples are:1463. Word classes and grammatical relations(163) asúke asúke
asúke asúke make
asúke asúke asúke‘four’
‘five’
‘six’[two+two]
[two+two+another]
[two+two+two]Phrasal numerals can occur with na, as in (164), or without na, as in (165),
depending on whether they are followed by the article, which is always
optional for numerals. Compare:
(164) memé(=i)
asú=ke
asú=ke make
na=i
two=and two=and another do=PL.AN
children(=PL.AN)
‘five children’ (lit. ‘two and two children and another’)
(165) unáng=i
asú=ke
asú=ke
two=and
two=and
woman=PL.AN
‘four women’ (lit. ‘two and two women’)
With regard to example (164), memé(=i) asú=ke asú=ke make ‘five children’
would also be possible, but not *memé(=i) asú=ke asú=ke mak=i because
phrasal numerals are fixed expressions. For odd numbers the form make
‘(an)other’ is used regardless of the gender of the counted entity. The segment
// in make is an article indicating gender but it has frozen in the form for the
third person singular.
In asumâtna ‘three’ [< asú mak na ‘two another do’] the final consonant in
mak ‘other’ has assimilated in place of articulation to the following nasal. It
seems that synchronically asumâtna is not analysed as asú ‘two’ and mak
‘other’ anymore. Especially younger speakers also use asú=ke make for
‘three’ (lit. ‘two and another’), thus regularizing the rules for counting to
include ‘three’.
It is not difficult to see how this counting method can get quite
cumbersome very quickly for the speakers, who nowadays operate with large
exact numbers on a regular basis. Consequently, Tok Pisin numerals have
replaced the traditional ones, roughly from six upwards, e.g.:
(166) memé=i
children(PL)=PL.ANfiftin
fifteen(TP)y
theretl-Ø-io=be
come.PFV-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
‘Fifteen children came.’
Younger speakers also use a digit-based system in which numbers with more
than one digit are broken down and each digit is rendered in the traditional3.10. Quantifiers147counting system with a short pause between the digits, e.g. elekiêm blim ‘ten’
(one nothing), elekiêm asúke asúke make ‘fifteen’ (one five), or asúke asúke
blim ‘forty’ (four nothing).
Instead of a numeral denoting an exact figure, the quantifier slot in the
noun phrase can be filled by homòn ‘many’, with which speakers do not
commit to a certain number:
(167) tíl=i
milil=i
black=PL.AN
dog=PL.AN
‘many big black dogs’sm=i
big=PL.ANhomòn=i
many=PL.ANContrary to Healey’s (1964a) claim, Mian indeed has a body-tally system
based on the number 27, as it is typical for the other Mountain Ok languages.
Healey writes:
All of the Ok languages except Minamin [sic!] and Wagarabai [i.e. the west
Mian dialect – SF] appear to use the round-the-body method of counting.
When counting, a person points successively to various parts of the body, and
the numerals mostly consist of some recognizable form of the body-part
names. One circuit of the body is a counting unit. Large numbers are
specified as so many units (circuits) plus such-and-such a number (bodypart). (Healey 1964a: 65)Counting in the Mian tally system commences with the left thumb, followed
by the fingers of the left hand, then up the left side of the body (wrist, forearm,
elbow, shoulder joint, shoulder, cheek, ear, eye, nose) each time adding one,
so that one reaches 14 when touching the nose. From there, counting proceeds
down the right side of the body (the pointing is done with the other hand now)
till the whole procedure ends with the thumb of the right hand and the number
27. Smith and Weston (1974b: 50-52) report that speakers become
increasingly vague while counting down the right-hand side of the body and
30 years later my own experience shows that speakers have trouble counting
within this traditional system once they have done the left hand and started
moving up the left arm.
The reason why the Mian system escaped Healey’s attention probably lies
in the fact that body-part numerals cannot be used as numerals in noun
phrases, which they can in Telefol. This might be because the Mian body-tally
system was never used as a general counting device, as for example in Telefol
(Healey 1964a, Healey 1965a), but rather was highly restricted to counting in
connection with specific cultural practices, for example keeping track of the
months that had to pass until a new taro garden would have to be cleared and
planted. Nowadays, the body-part counting system is basically defunct. In
table 3.17 I give all the forms I was able to record.","[170, 171, 172, 173]"

from pitch. The role of pitch in vowel length does not explain why the vowel
in /Hmn/ ‘child’ is considerably longer (185 ms) than the vowel in the second
syllable in /Lajal/ ‘light’ (125 ms), as both have level tones, a high and a low
one, respectively. Similarly, the length difference between /LHit/ ‘penis’ (260
ms) and /LHkwit/ ‘sugar cane’ (185 ms) cannot be due to tone because both
bear the same LH melody.
Some of these differences in length might be accounted for by relating
them to straightforward differences in syllable configuration. Throughout the
language, vowels in monosyllables are longer than vowels in syllables of
disyllables. Similarly, vowels in onset-less or coda-less syllables are longer
than vowels in syllables which have onsets or codas. It seems however less
probable that the absence or the presence of an onset, as in the pair /LHit/
‘penis’ (260 ms) vs. /LHkwit/ ‘sugar cane’ (185 ms) can indeed account for a
difference in duration of over 70ms.
The data and the discussion in this section might suggest there is evidence
for a phonemic length distinction in Mian vowels. However, a systematic
analysis of vowel length is impeded by the fact that there are no minimal
length pairs and not many near-minimal length pairs. What’s worse, vowel
length is generally subject to considerable variation between speakers (up to
60ms in some cases), and even between different tokens of the same word
uttered by a single speaker (again up to 60 ms in some cases). This range of
free length variation makes it hard to assign a given vowel to a discrete ‘long’
or ‘short’ phonemic category when genuine minimal pairs are absent, and
near-minimal pairs are rare. Furthermore, at this stage, the data available for
analysis are not sufficient to make any statistically valid generalizations about
vowel length. For that, more tokens and especially more different speakers
recording these tokens are needed.","[59, 60]"
"VerbsAs verbs are morphologically by far the most complex word class in Mian, I
will only be concerned with the defining features at this point and only give a
few examples to illustrate the most fundamental points about verb inflection in
Mian. For a detailed treatment of the morphology of the verb the reader is
referred to chapter 8.
Loans from Tok Pisin or English cannot be inflected like native Mian
verbs, but rather such loans have to be followed by the function verb ke ‘do’ in
a function verb construction:

do-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECLMian has intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, ambitransitive, and impersonal
(atransitive) verbs. Transitives can be productively derived from intransitives
and ditransitives from transitives. On basic argument structures and derived
ones, see sections 9.1 to 9.7.
Semantically, verbs refer to actions, processes, and states. Verbs fulfil the
function of the predicate of a clause.
Suprasegmentally, verbs are either unaccented, in which case they are alllow, or are lexically specified for an accent to which one of two complex tonal
melodies (either HL or LHL) is assigned. Nouns, on the other hand, are
associated with one of five tonal melodies.
Syntactically, verbs are easily identified. Mian is an SOV language.
Although there is some pragmatically motivated variability with respect to the
position of subject and object, the last word in a clause is almost always the
verb and under no circumstances can the verb be followed by any of its
arguments. Occasionally, however, one finds locative adjuncts postposed after
the verb which are adverbial modifiers of the preceding verb syntactically, but
which form their own intonational unit (see 11.2.10).
Morphologically, verbs can index their core arguments with pronominal
affixes cross-referencing subject (37) and object (38):1023. Word classes and grammatical relations(37)lo

For more information on the indexation of arguments on the verb, see the
sections 3.14 on grammatical relations, 8.5 on argument marking, and 9.2 on
transitive verbs.
Final verbs, i.e. verbs in independent sentences or in final clauses of clause
chains, can be inflected for various aspectual categories, e.g. -b ‘Imperfective’
(39), modal categories, e.g. -n ‘Realis’ (40), and temporal categories, e.g. -s
‘Remote past’ (41):

for co- or disjoint reference of the subject in the succeeding clause in
combination with sequentiality or simultaneity of events. In (42), the suffix -b
‘DS.SIM’ indicates that the event described in the first clause is on-going
when the event described by the second clause takes place and that this second
clause has a different subject:

A subset of verbs, almost all of which make predications of handling or
movement, has an obligatory classificatory prefix which classifies one of the
arguments according to semantic characteristics, namely sex, form, and
function, on an absolutive basis. In (43), the object fukêt ‘smoking gourd’ is
classified as belonging to the residue class.

About half of the verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with a
perfective/imperfective contrast. The rest are trans-aspectual, i.e. they have
only one stem which is vague with respect to aspect. A few verbs are defective
and lack either a perfective or an imperfective stem. Formally distinct
perfective and imperfective stems are subject to certain inflectional
restrictions, e.g. a perfective stem cannot be directly inflected for imperfective
aspect but has to enter an auxiliary construction. Trans-aspectual stems are not
restricted in terms of their inflectional morphology.
For certain tense-aspect combinations, some verbs cannot be inflected
directly, but have to be serialized with the existential verb functioning as an
auxiliary before inflection can proceed:

‘They used to cook and eat (some kind of fruit) until now.’Two verb stems can be compounded into one phonological and grammatical
verbal word which forms a single predication denoting a single event. Verbs
also frequently appear in serial verb constructions in which only the last verb
is fully inflected and all preceding verbs are either bare verb stems or stems
with affixes indexing any object(s) but lack TAM inflection or marking for1043. Word classes and grammatical relationssubject, polarity or illocutionary force. Mian allows verb serialization at the
core or the nuclear level. See 11.1 for a detailed description of verb
serialization.
Directionals can be directly inflected to form intransitive verbs of motion,
for example from daak ‘down’:
(45)daak-n-i=a
down-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
‘I go down and then I…’.","[127, 128, 129, 130]"
"231Focused noun phrases“[F]ocus is the most important or salient piece of information in the utterance,
as perceived by the speaker. [...] The focus [...] always presents new
information, though new relative to the topic, not necessarily new in the
discourse” (Siewierska 2004: 159).
Focus in Mian is marked by using an emphatic pronoun, etc., i.e. a bound
pronominal form suffixed with the emphatic pronoun suffix -ta (see 3.7.4)
Marking of focus is characteristic of Papuan languages in general, contrary to
fixed positional encoding in European languages, where focus is associated
with clause-final position (Foley 2000: 387-8).
Contrastive focus in Mian is generally expressed by using emphatic
pronouns. Two examples are given below:
(100) 
3SG.M

3SG.MAsuneb=e=mo
PN=SG.M=NEGa-têm’-Ø-e=ba=be

‘He didn’t seen Asuneng. He saw Beitab.’
(101) [...] ‘she married him and they stayed there for some time and then...’

3SG.F_CL.O-take-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
‘the husband went to sit down at pig fruits (to ambush pigs), the wife
took the mother and ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]
Focus marking with the emphatic pronoun is obligatory in alternative
questions (see 10.1.3). When there is a choice between two alternatives, each2326. The noun phraseexpressed by a noun phrase, both are in contrastive focus and emphatic
pronouns have to be used, as in the following example:
(102) kbo
2SG.Méil
pig-ta
SG.M-EMPHbleka
or-ta
SG.M-EMPHaning
fishdowôn’-aamab-eb=a?
eat-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=Q
‘Do you want to eat pork or fish?’
On completive focus in content questions with wan ‘who’, see 10.2.7.
Focus marking is used in comparisons. I recorded example (103) as the
Mian translation of the English sentence “Port Moresby is bigger that
Vanimo” (|| indicates an intonational break):
(103) Mosbi
PN=le
SG.N2=TOP|| sm
bigeka
andBanimo
PN-ta
SG.N2-EMPHgwáab=o=be
small=PRD=DECL
‘(As for) Port Moresby (, it) is big, and Vanimo is small.’
This example consists of a topical noun phrase ‘Port Moresby’, set off
intonationally from the rest of the utterance, and a comment which actually
predicates something about this topic. The comparative element is focused
with -ta, but the statement, which prima facie seems to be about Vanimo, is in
effect a statement about the topic Port Moresby.","[257, 258]"
"IdentityNon-verbal predications express more or less permanent states, as opposed to
temporary ones. They are commonly used to state the identity of some
referent:
(123) n
1SGBikene=i
PN=PL.ANunáng=o=bo
woman=PRD=QUOTge
baa-s-o=a
say.PFV say.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
‘ “I am a woman of the Bikene (people)” she said, and then someone
else…’ [Dimosson]
The following example (124) illustrates the reversed order of the topic and the
comment, see ungrammatical (125), if the predicate term is a proper name, kin
noun, or dyad (when the predication is about identity). In this case the topic
has to be an emphatic pronoun, compare grammatical (124) with
ungrammatical (126):
(124) Kaseningn-ta=be
1SG-EMPH=DECL
‘I’m Kasening.’PN9.11. Non-verbal clauses373(125) *n

"With ke ‘do’The function verb ke ‘do’ can take nouns as a coverb. In some cases the word
class of a coverb collocated with ke ‘do’ is hard to determine because it only
occurs in this particular construction. An example with a noun follows:
(219) naka
manhomòn
manyunáng
womanhomòn=i
many=PL.ANtekein
ke-n-ib=ta
knowledge do-SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
‘many men and many women knew (it)’ [Sofelok, 2]
Selected examples illustrating the use of ke ‘do’ in a function verb
construction with a coverb are given in table 8.28.",[350]
"Contrasts involving pharyngealizationGenuine minimal pairs involving a pharyngealized /a/ are relatively rare, i.e. a
pair of words in which the quality of the ‘a’ differs but the tone is the same.
Examples are:
(41)al
aal
atdab
atdaab/Lal/
/Lal/
/Latlab/
/Latlab/[al]
[al]
[atdaph]
[atdaph]‘faeces’
‘skin’
‘stick’
‘young branch’ayal
ayaal/Lajal/
/Lajal/[a-j-al]
[a-j-al]‘light’
‘tree species’362. PhonologyThere are more near-minimal pairs in which the pharyngealization contrast is
accompanied by a contrast in tone or segmental environment. The following
list gives a selection of near-minimal pairs involving pharyngealization:
(42)i
aai/Hai/
/Lai/[i]
[ai]‘dad’
‘water’ng
áng/Ha/
/LHa/[]
[á]‘batch, package’
‘tree species’mak
daak/Lmak/
/Llak/[makh]
[dakh]‘other’
‘down’In several cases, pharyngealization is less conspicuous because in some
speakers it is only discernible if the pitch of their voice is sufficiently low (e.g.
lower that approximately 100 Hz for one speaker). Otherwise the vowel does
not sound pharyngealized. Some example are given in (43):
(43)am
áam
âam/Lam/
/LHam/
/LHLam/[am]
[ám]
[am ]‘house’
‘pandanus species’
‘older sister’6tang

[dá]‘true’
‘fence’
‘garden’
‘back’n
áan/Han/
/LHan/[n]
[án]‘arrow’
‘leaf, hair, feather’Other words which fall into this category are: /LHbab/ ‘aunt’, /LHmab/ ‘frog’,
/LHham/ ‘corpse’, /LHal/ ‘tree species’, and /LHtal/ ‘leash’.
Matters are complicated by the fact that in the majority of cases the use of
pharyngealized /a/ is not consistent between speakers. There was one speaker
who invariably pronounced an ‘a’ pharyngealized in the final syllable of
disyllabic words with a falling melody. As none of the others did that, I will
not consider the pharyngealization to be phonemic in this case, but to be a
feature of this speaker’s idiolect. So this speaker would pronounce the
following two words as indicated in the phonetic representations:2.4. Pharyngealization(44)2.4.2.ayàl
ibâl/HLajal/
/LHLibal/[-j-àl]
[iàl]37‘paternal grandfather’
‘paper wasp’Creaky voice accompanying pharyngealized /a/If pharyngealization and low tone come together in a syllable, the voice of
some speakers becomes creaky, e.g. /Llak/ ‘down’ can be pronounced either
[dakh] or [da kh]. As creaky voice – when it occurs – is always a result of
pharyngealization, I will not treat it as a part of the phonological system of
Mian but rather as an optional phonetic effect of pharyngealized /a/ under a
low tone.","[61, 62, 63]"
"Map 1.1. The Ok languages of Papua New Guinea1.1. Mian wéng: The Mian language3Geographically, the Mianmin area is delimited by the August and May Rivers
in the west and east, respectively, and the Hindenburg Range in the south.
This area is roughly located between the 141st and 142nd degrees of longitude
and between the 4th and 5th parallels. Mianmin airstrip and the villages
Timeilmin and Temsakmin, where the data used in this description of the
language were obtained, is located at 4º 54' south and 141º 37' east.
Mian has about 1,750 speakers according to the 2000 census (Lewis 2009).
Two dialect varieties can be distinguished: West Mian (also known as
Wagarabai or Skonga)3 in and around Yapsiei, a government and Catholic
mission station about 15 km east of the border to Papua (Irian Jaya) with
approximately 350 speakers, and East Mian in the villages around Mianmin
airstrip (Timeilmin, Temsakmin, and Sokamin), in Gubil, Fiak, and Hotmin
with approximately 1,400 speakers. While the western dialect is contiguous to
several other Ok languages to the west and to the non-related Abau language
(Bailey 1975) upstream from Yapsiei, the eastern dialect is in contact with the
closely related Ok languages Telefol to the east and south and Tifal to the
southwest. Some men above 50 years of age speak or at least understand
Telefol. The map shows geographical contiguity with the Lowland Ok
language Ngalum as well but there are no traditional ties between Mian and
Ngalum speakers.
Both Mian dialects are under strong influence from English and Tok Pisin,
the local variety of Neo-Melanesian pidgin (Verhaar 1995). Although the
former is clearly the most prestigious of the two and school education and
official business is conducted in English, Tok Pisin serves as a lingua franca
throughout the area. Only old speakers (above 75 years of age) have little or
no Tok Pisin. Mian speakers are aware of the influence of these nonindigenous languages, especially their destructive influence, and some
regularly identify words and grammatical constructions which are inspired by
or calqued from either Tok Pisin or English. They describe these words and
constructions as wan wéng funin or tablasébwali wéng funin, meaning ‘Tok
Pisin thinking’ and ‘English thinking’, respectively.4 As is the case in many
parts of the world, creoles and pidgins like Tok Pisin and the languages of the
European colonizers in combination with the prestige associated with these
idioms and the inferiority associated with the tok ples, i.e. the local,
indigenous languages, endanger the future of both Mian dialects. One speaker
(a local school teacher) estimated that Mian will have vanished in favour of
Tok Pisin and English in 50 to 100 years. My impression is that the eastern
dialect is even more susceptible to this development because the speakers are
generally more educated, have better English and higher chances of finding
work outside the speech community or going to college or university where
Mian is no good as a means of communication so that they are forced to speak
Tok Pisin or English.","[28, 29]"
"44611. Chaining constructionsThe suffix -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’ has a default temporal interpretation of
‘Immediate past’, but one finds verb forms marked in this way interspersed in
discourse about various stages of the past:
(81)ilem=e
blood=SG.N1te=ta
come.PFV=MEDna-ˆt’-ne-n-e=be
make-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-3SG.N1.SBJ=DECL
‘(Some) blood comes and does (this) to me.’ [Afoksitgabáam]
The suffix -s ‘Remote past’ locates events in the remote past. It is mainly
found in myths and stories about the past or in actual historical accounts.
(82)yle
éil=e
a-nâ’-s-ib=e?
well
pig=SG.M 3SG.M.O-kill.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=Q
‘Well, did they kill the pig?’ [History of Mianmin and Telefomin]The suffix -b ‘Imperfective’ has a default temporal interpretation of ‘present’
but can also be used for events in the past, as in (83):
(83)met
upriverte
come.PFVyomin
am=o
initiation house=N2gen-b-io=be
build.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
‘They came upriver and were building the initiation house.’
[Initiation rituals]
S/R markers having their origin in the TAM morphology of the language does
not seem to be a common development in New Guinea languages. Existing
theories of the origin of S/R markers in Papuan languages trace them back
either to gapping under identity, which gives rise to zero marking for SS
(Haiman 1983), or to a pronominal or deictic origin. For a condensed
summary of these theories of origin and an evaluation of their plausibility, see
Roberts (1997: 190-192). In general, homophony between aspect and S/R
markers does not seem to be well attested typologically, but see Jacobsen
(1983: 174-177) on some formal similarities of S/R and aspectual morphology
in North American languages.
Yet, the formal parallels between the Mian TAM markers in final verbs
and S/R markers in medial verbs are too striking to be coincidence and the11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining447semantics of the former make them very likely candidates for the forms from
which the latter have been derived.
The S/R marker -n originates in the homophonous realis mood marker. So
what it does is simply marking the ‘real’ status (Foley and Van Valin 1984) of
an event. As a marker in medial verbs, -n remains noncommittal with respect
to conjoint or disjoint subject reference in the verb of the reference clause with
the added complication that -n does function as a fully developed S/R marker
if the subject is first person singular.
In medial verbs, the suffix -b means ‘DS.SIM’ and in final verbs -b means
‘Imperfective’. Apart from the homophony there is also a semantic
connection. In final verbs, marking for imperfective aspect by -b indicates that
the action is on-going at the moment of speaking. In medial verbs, -b indicates
that an action is on-going when the next takes place, in other words, that the
two actions are overlapping and at least partially simultaneous. Looking at it
from the other end, an action or event which is marked as simultaneous with
the one described in the following clause is very likely to be temporally
extended (barring the case where two punctual actions occur simultaneously,
as in “(Right) as the clock struck one, the bullet hit him”).5 Hence, there is a
strong association between imperfective aspect and simultaneity of events.
Longacre (1983) argues for a two-fold ‘naturalness assumption’ in S/R
languages. By this he means an association between SS marking and
sequentiality, on the one hand, and DS marking and simultaneity, on the other.
It is the case that “[…] we can normally expect that actions in succession are
performed by the same person, while actions that overlap are performed by
different people” (p. 183).
If we follow Longacre and assume that actions which occur simultaneously
are expected to be performed by different individuals, it is not surprising that
the marker -b acquired DS as an additional meaning in medial verbs.
The suffix -n, on the other hand, which goes back to the homophonous
realis marker, generally only signals sequentiality of events but if it indicates a
S/R-related meaning, namely with first person singular subjects, it will always
be SS. Hence, even -n goes the way predicted by the naturalness assumption.
The marker -s ‘DS.SEQ’ is derived from a deictic tense category, namely
‘Remote past’, the temporal meaning would of course be sequential. Two
points are noteworthy here.
First, -s has acquired a further meaning apart from DS. It is used to express
sequentiality, DS, and a close temporal or causal relation between events. This
is in contrast to -Ø ‘DS.SEQ’, which does not have this additional meaning.
Second, it might seem counterintuitive that a S/R marker meaning ‘DS.SEQ’
should be derived from the remote past tense suffix. After all, ‘Remote past’ is
not part of the meaning -s has in medial verbs. However, only TAM suffix
occurring in final verbs that is not also used in medial verbs is44811. Chaining constructions-b(H) ‘Non-Hodiernal past’, which is (at least segmentally) homophonous with
-b ‘Imperfective’ in final verbs and ‘DS.SIM’ in medial verbs. Hence, if one
assumes that the language filled out its S/R paradigm by deriving forms from
the TAM suffixes used in final verbs, it seems that choosing -s was a
reasonable option for the language.
Finally, we have to account for the most problematic case, namely -Ø
‘DS.SEQ’. Like -n ‘(SS.)SEQ’, it always indicates event sequentiality, which is
not surprising given their common origin is the realis marker -n ~ -Ø. Unlike
-n ‘(SS.)SEQ’, however, it forces the reference clause subject to be disjoint in
reference. The semantic dissociation between the S/R markers -n and -Ø needs
an explanation because as mood markers in final verbs they are allomorphs,
both with the meaning ‘Realis’. However, the semantic dissociation in the S/R
forms is only partial. A substantial, and I would argue crucial, portion of the
meaning remains constant. Both -n and -Ø still signal sequentiality which is
associated with the ‘Realis meaning’ of the original mood marker. The
dissociation only began when the additional meaning of SS or DS filtered into
the aspect system of medial verbs. It seems quite natural that the language
would have chosen one of these two to also indicate SS and the other to also
indicate DS apart from their basic temporal meaning of sequentiality, once a
SS/DS contrast had developed elsewhere in the system.","[471, 472, 473, 474]"

"Modified noun phrasesMian has two main classes of nominal modifiers: (a) adjectives, whose
function is to specify colour, size/dimension, and quality, and (b) quantifiers,
which comprise numerals and homòn ‘many’ and whose function is
quantification. Mian has prenominal and head-internal relative clauses. While
the former precede the noun, the latter are clauses marked as noun phrases
with an article or an adnominally used pronoun. Relative clauses will be
described in detail in section 13.3 under embedding.",[234]
