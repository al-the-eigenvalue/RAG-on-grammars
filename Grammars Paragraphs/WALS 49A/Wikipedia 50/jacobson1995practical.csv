Personal Pronouns
Throughout the preceding chapters we have seen how the role that personalpronouns (“she,” “her,” “I,” “you,” “they,” etc.) play in a language like English is
filled by the system of noun and verb endings in Yup’ik. However we have also
seen how there is a role for personal pronouns as separate words in, for example,
the terminalis for subject of embedded transitive verb (see Chapter 18) as in:
Qanrutellruanga elpenun teglellruniluku. ‘She told me that you stole it’
(elpenun is the 2nd person singular personal pronoun in the terminalis case).
Aatavet wangnun navrallruyuksaaqan pelatekani. ‘Your father wrongly
thinks that I borrowed his tent’ (wangnun is the Ist person singular
personal pronoun in the terminalis case).
There are in fact a full range of personal pronouns in Yup’ik, in all cases and
numbers.",[398]
"118GRAMMAROF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUP IKSubject and Object with Transitive Verbs
The grammatical cases used for subject and object with a transitive verb are
different than those used with an intransitive verb.
If the object of a transitive verb is expressed with a separate noun, then that
itive verb:
noun is put in the absolutive case, just like the subject of an intransve verb
Neqa neraa. ‘She is eating the fish. (The object neqa of the transitihere is absolutive as it is when it is the subject of an intransitive verb as
in neqa taigug ‘the fish is coming.’)If the subject of a transitive verb is expressed with aseparate noun, then that
noun is put in the relative case, just like the possessor of a possessed noun:
ve
Arnam neraa. ‘The woman is eating it.’ (The subject arnam of the transiti
as
verb here is relative as it is when it is the possessor of a possessed noun
in arnam atkua ‘the woman’s parka.’)Both subject and object may be expressed with nouns in the appropriate cases:
Arnam neraa neqa. ‘The woman is eating the fish.’One must be fully aware that the role of the absolutive case shifts from indicatingve verb:
the subject with an intransitive verb to indicating the object with a transiti
way:
intransitive verb: subject (in absolutive case) does something or is someQimugta qilugtug. ‘The dog is barking.’
some
transitive verb: subject (in relative case) does something to, or bears
relation to object (in absolutive case); for example:Agayulirtem nunuraa qimugta. ‘The preacher is scolding the dog.’
This characteristic of the language, that the form or case used for the subjectof the
of the intransitive is the same as the form or case used for the objecttransitive, is called ergativity.
are:
Statements that give the (main) uses of absolutive and relative cases
Uses of the absolutive case:
(1) subject of intransitive verb, as in qimugta qilugtuq
(2) object of a transitive verb, as in gimugta nunuraaUses of the relative case:
(1) subject of a transitive verb, as in gimugtem qilugaa(2) possessor of another noun, as in gqimugtem pamyua.","[127, 128]"
"Indefinite Objects of Verbs; the Ablative-Modalis Case
Nouns can also be used as the indefinite object of a verb with an ending fromChapter 2, but then the noun must be changed from its citation form in the
absolutive case to another form called the ablative-modalis case. This is because
it is the ending of the noun which shows whether it is the subject or the object
of the verb, rather than the position of the noun in the sentence as in English.
For example in the sentence angun ner’uq kemegmek or angun kemegmek
ner’uq ‘the man is eating meat’ or ‘the man is eating some meat,’ the word
kemegmek is an indefinite object in the ablative-modalis case. Kemegmek is
said to be an indefinite object because another construction with a definite object
is used to express ‘the man is eating the meat.’ This latter type of construction
will be dealt with later in this book.
Theendingof thesingularablative-modalisis ~%mek.",[42]
"Arnat iqvaryugtut curanek nunapigmi. ‘The women want to pick
blueberries on the tundra.’ (But compare: tengssuun mit’ellruuq
nunapigmun. ‘The plane landed on the tundra.’ Even though the
English translation uses ‘on’ rather than ‘to’, the terminalis is used
because motion from one place to another is involved.)Mikelnguut aquigut ellami. ‘The children are playing outside’ (literally:
‘in the outside’).
Calillruuten-qaa kipusvigmi akwaugaq? Were you working in the store
yesterday?’1. The terminalis case is also called the “allative” in works on Eskimo grammar, and corresponds
to some extent to the dative case of many (especially Indo-European) languages.
2. The localis case is also called the “locative” in works on Eskimo grammar.",[57]
"#4 The word pelatekagq ‘tent’ is from Russian, and is pronounced palatkaaq in NS. Apparently
there is no non-loanword for ‘tent’ in Yup’ik, which is evidence that perhaps Yup’iks did not
use tents before the Russian came, unlike the Inupiags who used skin tents and have a nonloanword for them. Or it may be that an older Yup’ik word for tent has been totally replaced
by the Russian loan.
#5 Instead of tan’gerpak for ‘crowberry’ there is paunraq in NS, some Y, Nun, and Eg, andkavlakuaragq in HBC.
#6 Instead of tumagliq for ‘low-bush cranberry’ there is kitngik in NS and Y (?). The word
kavirligq ‘red thing’ is also used as a name for this type of berry. ‘High-bush cranberry’ is
mercuullugpak, and ‘bog cranberry’ is uingiar(aq) or uskutuliaraq in NS and Y.
#7 The words ugasqinarge- ‘to be slippery’ and ugasqite- ‘to slip’ are used in these forms in K
above Bethel, upriver Y, some NR, and LI. These words are pronounced qurrasqinarge-and qurrasqite- in NS, downriver Y, NI, Can, K below Bethel, BB, and some NR. They are
pronounced qurasqite-, and qurasqinarge- in HBC. The pronunciation or pair of forms
with ug is one of the few cases of Yup’ik words with this sound other than the demonstratives
augna, paugna, and qaugna and words derived from them (aug’ar- ‘to get out of the way,’
and taugaam ‘however, but’). The other cases are ugasek ‘jackrabbit, tundra hare’ (NI and
Can), and ugalguun ‘fishskin bag, quiver for arrows,’ and ugayar- ‘to pillage’ (also wayar-,and mayar-), ugaq’allaga- ‘to retch repeatedly’ (onomatopoeia; also waq’allaga-), qaugeq
or qaugiigq ‘eider duck,’ and qaugyagq ‘sand.’Note A
The participial mood in Alutiiq and Siberian Yupik, the closest languages to Central Yup’ik,
is the common way of expressing “past tense” (in narrative at least, in Siberian Yupik). This may
have been the original role of this verb mood in Central Yup’ik as well. The present-day Central
Yup’ik means of expressing “past tense,” that is by means of the postbase -llru-, is no doubt a
historically recent innovation. This postbase is clearly from -lleq ‘one that V-ed,’ and ~:(ng)u-‘to be N,’ so that, for example, qilullruug ‘it barked,’ literally means ‘it is one that barked.’ This
postbase -llru-, is not used at all in NSU, where “past tense” as well as “present tense” is
expressed with the indicative unmarked for time. Possibly the present-day uses of the participial
are a remnant of its former broader use. On the other hand, the Inuit (especially Greenlandic)
verb form that corresponds to the Yup’ik participial (in function though not so closely in form) seems
to suggest that the present Central Yup’ik use may be closer to the original use of this verb mood.
The fact that the third person subject person/number markers are exactly the same as the
possessed absolutive noun endings (see Chapters 5 and 6) coupled with the fact that both mood
markers (transitive indicative and transitive participial) are identical with certain nominalizing
postbases suggests that historically a transitive sentence, at least one with a third person
subject, can be viewed as an identity of two noun phrases. Thus arnam neraa akutaq ‘the
woman is eating the Eskimo ice cream,’ can be viewed as arnam neraa = akutaq that is, ‘the
woman’s eaten thing is the Eskimoice cream,’ and similarly for arnam nerkii akutaq. This may
shed light on the historical origins of ergativity in Yup’ik and in Eskimo languages in general
while explaining why the relative case has the two roles it has (possessor and subject of transitive
verb). This should be regarded as only an insight on the ancient history of the language. There
remain manyunexplained developmentssubsequent to the historical phase in question (forexample, the fact that fourth person forms always point back to the subject whether it is the
absolutive subject of an intransitive verb, or the relative subject of a transitive verb).",[408]
"Ablative-Modalis of Place from which
The ablative-modalis case can also mean ‘from.”! This is the place from which
use of the ablative-modalis case, as in the following examples:Tekituq pengunek. ‘She arrived from the hills.’
Akwaugagq ayallruukut nunamek.’ ‘We left (from) the village yesterday.’

Postbases
The postbases for this chapter are used with noun bases and yield verb bases.
1. This second use explains the hyphenated name “ablative-modalis.” In Inupiaq/Inuit Eskimo
languages there are two separate cases, the ablative meaning basically ‘from,’ and the modalis
used for indefinite object. The endings of the two cases are different in Inupiag/Inuit. However
in all the Yupik Eskimo languages there is only case, one ending, for both uses or meanings. It
is not certain which is the innovation and which is the original pattern: separate ablative and
modalis cases now combined in Yupik, or a single ablative-modalis case now split in Inupiag/
Inuit. The modalis is also called the “instrumental” in works on Eskimo grammar.

"Yup’ik (and Eskimo in general) is very much a gender-neutral language. It
has no words comparable to “mankind” or “workman” which assume a certain
gender bias. Moreover in Eskimo languages the various morphemes indicating
third person singular are not marked for gender. Thus, the word that means ‘he
is here’ also means ‘she is here’ and ‘it is here,’ and the word for ‘she is asleep’ also
means ‘he is asleep.’ This situation leads to a certain problem in translating such
words into English. Even though accurate, it is extremely cumbersome to
repeatedly read (and write) ‘he, she or it is here’, ‘he/she is asleep,’ ‘3s is here’ or‘(s)he is asleep’ and even worse to have to say something like ‘he or she is
putting his or her son to sleep in his or her own bed!’ To avoid such difficulties
as well as to avoid the objectionable aspects of routinely using the masculine
third person singular pronouns ‘he,’ ‘him’ and ‘his’ as a convention for ‘he or she,
‘him or her,’ ‘his or her’ (as has sometimesbeen done in Eskimoand othergrammars and dictionaries), in this book every even-numbered chapter uses onlyxGRAMMAROF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIK‘he,’ ‘him’ and ‘his,’ and every odd-numbered chapter uses only ‘she’ and ‘her’ for
the third person singular (for humans that is; for non-humans of course the word
‘it? is used). Thus in an even-numbered chapter one should understand the
English gloss ‘he is asleep’ to mean ‘he or she is asleep,’ and in an odd-numbered
chapter one should understand the gloss ‘she is here’ as meaning ‘he, she or it is
here.’ The only exceptions will be cases where biology overrides such a convention, so that, for example, even in an even-numbered chapter one will see ‘she is
a mother’ rather than ‘he is a mother’ (even though the Yup’ik word itself could
also mean ‘he ...’). On the other hand, no allowance is made for culturally
determined gender roles no matter how fixed or traditional such roles are. Thus,for example, in an even-numbered chapter one may find ‘he is sewing a parka’
(meaning ‘he or she is sewing a parka’), and in an odd-numbered chapter one may
find ‘she is hunting’ (meaning ‘he or she is hunting’).","[7, 8]"
"This means that yuinag is used in ‘twenty’ up to but not including ‘forty,’ and ‘forty’ is literally‘two ipiaqs,’ rather than ‘two yuinags.’ Furthermore ipiaq as a multiplier is always singular
and comes after the number by which it is multiplied. So people who use this format say malruk
ipiaq for ‘forty’ rather than yuinaak
yuinaat pingayun.malruk,and pingayunipiaq for ‘sixty’ rather thanTwo areas have special words for ‘(one) hundred.’At the mouth of the Yukon a word kavluunis used for this, while in some NR negavagq is used. Because of the undistinguished role of thisquantity (‘one hundred’) in the native Yupik base-twenty counting system, one expects that, as
in the case of tiissitsaaq ‘one thousand,’ these two words came from outside the language.",[440]
"Those bases that can take both intransitive and transitive endings divideinto two groups. Those in one group mean ‘subject is V-ing’ or ‘subject is V-ingsomething’ when used with an intransitive ending, and merely add a definite
object (‘subject is V-ing object’) when used with a transitive ending. The action
of the subject stays the same. These are called agentive verb bases. For example:
nuteg- ‘to shoot’; intransitive: nutegtuq ‘he shot’; transitive: nutgaa ‘he
shot it’
nere- ‘to eat’; intransitive: ner’ugq ‘he is eating’; transitive: neraa ‘he is
eating it’qilug- ‘to bark’; intransitive: qilugtug ‘it is barking’, transitive: qilugaa ‘it
is barking at him’Those in the other group add someone (or something) that is acting on the
object causing it to V when used with a transitive ending. The subject of the
intransitive becomes the object of the transitive. These are called patientive verb
bases. For example:naveg- ‘to break’; intransitive: navegtugq ‘it broke’; transitive: navgaa ‘he
broke it’
kuve- ‘to spill’; intransitive: kuv’uq ‘it spilled, it is spilling’; transitive:
kuvaa ‘he spilled it, he is spilling it’
tamar- ‘to lose, get lost’; intransitive: tamartuq ‘it got lost’; transitive:
tamaraa ‘he lost it’CHAPTER EIGHT123Often, but not always, the question of whether a particular verb base is
intransitive-only, transitive-only, agentive, or patientive, will be exactlythe same asin English (as is the case for the bases (except for gilug-) givenin the examples above). A learner of Yupik need pay attention primarily in
cases where Yupik and English differ. For an example of a case where the two
languages differ, consider that “bark” is intransitive-only in English (one cannotsay ‘it barks him’), but in Yup’ik qilug- is agentive as we have seen — one does notneedanythingin Yup’ikto correspondto the Englishpreposition“at”; thetransitive ending takes care of this. Conversely, in English “leave” isa transitive verb;
one can say ‘I will leave the village tomorrow’, but in Yup’ik one cannot use ayag-‘to leave’ with a transitive ending: *ayagciqaqa to mean ‘I will leave it’, but must
rather use an intransitive ending on the verb and an ablative-modalis noun:ayagciqua nunamek unuaqu, literally ‘I will leave from the village tomorrow’.","[132, 133]"
"CHAPTER 2
Intransitive Indicative Verbs; Yes-No QuestionsTypes of Yup’ik Words, and Suffixes
The majority of Yup’ik words are nouns and verbs. Nouns and verbs inflect,that is, they change, taking various endings. There are also a few adverbs,
conjunctions, and the like, which do not in general inflect and which we shall callparticles. However, there are no articles, adjectives, prepositions or words in
some of the other categories familiar from English. Suffixes serve the same
functions in Yup’ik that these categories of words serve in English. Suffixationis a very important and powerful process in Yup’ik, far more so than in English.
Only nounsand verbs, and not particles (with certain exceptions), can takesuffixes. Unlike English, Yup’ik has virtually no prefixes, and, also unlike
English, Yup’ik does not form compound words.","[26, 27]"

(or possibly five) Yupik Eskimo languages. The others are Central Siberian
Yupik spoken on St. Lawrence Island and the Chukchi Peninsula of Siberia,
Naukanski spoken only on the Chukchi Peninsula, and Alutiiq (also called
Sugpiag, Suk, Pacific Gulf Yupik, and, loosely, Aleut) spoken around Prince
William Sound, the tip of the Kenai Peninsula, Kodiak Island, and the Alaska
Peninsula. These Yupik languages along with the Inupiaq or Inuit language
spoken in northern Alaska, northern Canada, and Greenland constitute theEskimo branch of the Eskimo-Aleut family oflanguages. The position ofSirenikski,spoken only in Siberia and now nearly extinct, as another Yupik language or athird branch of Eskimo (along with Yupik and Inupiaq/Inuit) has not been
definitively determined. The other branch of the Eskimo-Aleut family, Aleut, is
spoken on the Aleutian chain and the Pribilof and Commander Islands.
In this book Central Alaskan Yup’ik will be mostly referred to simply as“Yupik,” the apostrophe distinguishing the name from that of other Yupik
Eskimo languages.","[2, 3, 4, 5]"

Parse (grammatically label) each of the above three examples, and show how
the numbers of each element mesh with that of adjoining elements.
First to Second and Second to First Person TransitiveConsider the 1st person to 2nd person ‘I/we to you,’ and the 2nd person to 1st

The elements. m, mte/mce, rpe, rpeci, which indicate ‘I,’ ‘we,’ ‘you,’ and‘you,, as subjects in the above endings are recognizable as slightly shortened
forms of relative case noun endings with 1st or 2nd person possessor, similar to
the terminalis and other cases with 1st or 2nd person possessor (see chapter 9).","[166, 167]"

Tekitellruukut kuigmun. ‘We arrived at the river’ (literally: ‘to the river’).
Localis CaseStill another noun case, the localis case indicates the place at which
something occurs.” The localis case is marked by ~%mi in the singular and by
~%ni in the plural, and thus is also like the ablative-modalis and the terminalis.",[57]
"Terminalis Case
The ablative-modalis case is used for an indefinite object, and also to indicatethe place from which motion occurs. Another case, the terminalis case, indicates
the place to which motion occurs.' The terminalis case is marked by ~%mun inthe singular and by ~%nun in the plural so it is like the ablative-modalis in
regard to suffixation processes.",[57]

Vialis CaseYup’ik nouns have two more cases in addition to the cases discussed in
previous chapters. One of these is the vialis, the ending of which is %kun in the
singular and %tgun in the plural, and which means ‘by way of, through, or viaN'(the vialis of route, or vialis of place through which), or ‘by means of N’ (the
vialis of instrument).'
1. The vialis case is also called the “translocative” or “perlative” in works on Eskimo grammar.","[82, 83]"
"Differences between the examples, exercises and patterns given herein and
the speech of any Yup’ik-speaking reader are due to dialect differences or to the
fact that the language is changing rather rapidly now, and the speech of younger
speakers is often not the same as that of older speakers. In some cases the Yup’ik
herein represents older patterns of speech and in other cases it represents newer
patterns, though the patterns not presented are at least mentioned in footnotes
or supplementary sections if not in the text itself. It is no easy task to decidewhether to present conservative or innovative patterns. If conservative patterns
are presented as the standard in a language textbook, then the book could be
criticized for not keeping pace with the language as it is actually spoken today.
Conversely if innovative patterns are presented as the standard, then the bookcould be criticized for endorsing a form of the language which younger speakers
themselves might well abandon as they grow older.
Although the Yup’ik has been checked by native speakers, the exercises and
example sentences were written by the author, and may still in certain subtle
ways give evidence of the fact that they were composed by someone who is nota native speaker of the language. Also, so as not to obscure the point being made,
some Yup’ik sentences are written in a style that, while valid, is not the mostidiomatic Yup’ik possible.
The background information for this book comes from a number of nativeYupik speakers. For the most part they are the same group acknowledged in
YEG: Paschal Afcan, Martha Teeluk, Sophie Shield, Joseph Coolidge, Marie
Meade, also Lucy Coolidge, Balassia W. Nicolai, and above all others, my wife,Anna Jacobson (who is the source of most of the new information on Yup’ik
grammar that is in the present book and was not in YEG). Thanks are due
especially to those who worked with Yup’ik before I began studying it and who
co-authored YEG with me: Irene Reed, Osahito Miyaoka, Michael Krauss and
Paschal Afcan, to my colleagues at the Alaska Native Language Center with
whom I have discussed Eskimo grammar in general and Yup’ik grammar inPREFACExlparticular: Jeff Leer and Lawrence Kaplan, Anthony Woodbury, and Osahito
Miyaokawhosearticles on Yup’ik have been very informative, and to thosewhose writings on the grammar of other Eskimo languages preceded the effort
that went into YEG and hence into the present book: Samuel Kleinschmidt, C. W.
Schultz-Lorentzen, and Knut Bergsland for Greenlandic, and Francis Barnum
and John Hinz for Yup’ik. An immense debt is owed to all the students, native
Yup’ik speakers and others, who have taken Yup’ik classes from me over theyears here at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and who have pointed out to
me the errors and inadequacies in previous trial editions of this work, as well as
in YEG. Unless noted otherwise, the stories, dialogs and other connectedreadings (excluding those at the end of the book) were written especially for this
book by Anna Jacobson. Since it is likely that many students using this textbook
will be native speakers of Yup’ik seeking to learn more about their language, thereadings have not been simplified, as is the general practice in language
textbooks. However, footnotes to the readings are provided as a way of explaining
grammatical constructions and vocabulary not presented before the chapter in
which the story appears.","[8, 9]"
"The motivation for this rule is not merely to make written words shorter
(though given the fact that words in Yup’ik — and Eskimo languages in general
— are often quite long, this is no trivial consideration). In addition, it is often the
case that a given word “core” will have a voiceless fricative when used with a
suffix that begins with a stop, but will have the corresponding voiced fricative in
1. Thus, the rounded fricative ug as in augna ‘the one going away’ becomes voiceless when next
to a stop as in augkut ‘the ones going away,’ however the voiceless counterpart of ug is written
w, so this work augkut could also be written awkut.
2. Recall that Yup’ik stops are voiceless. One category of exception to the general prohibition ofmixed clusters is that a nasal followed by a stop or voiceless fricative will be voiced. This is
discussed latter in this sections, as are the infrequent cases that violate the general prohibition.",[16]
"If Southwestern Alaska had had other inhabitants when the Yup’iks arrived, one
would expect their place names to have survived (even if the people and their
language did not survive). One can see this in the many American place names
from Indian groups, such
“Tanana,” and “Sitka.”as “Mississippi,”“Massachusetts,”and in AlaskaIn some cases a place name will become analyzable when one looks at another
Eskimo language. To give an example, there is a place on Nunivak Island called
Qikmirtalek. The postbase +talek means ‘one with lots of N,’ but the base
qikmigq is not known in Central Yup’ik. Qikmiq, however, is used in Alutiiq,
Siberian Yupik and Inupiaq (in the form ginmiq, gipmig or gimmiq) as the word
for ‘dog.’ The Nunivak place name Qikmirtalek probably dates from a timewhen the word qikmigq was used at least in that part of Central Yup’ik. The
meaning of the name “Nunivak” itself can be determined from Siberian Yupik
where it means ‘tundra’ and ‘rosewort.’ (The form nunivak is exactly the
Siberian Yupik form; on Nunivak Island itself the form of the name is Nunivaagq.)437CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURExercise 24-2
Take the Yup’ik village names from the map in the Yup’ik Eskimo Dictionary,
determine the English equivalent of each, and analyze the Yup’tk.
Yup’ik Naming Practices
‘A newborn baby is given the Yup’ik name of the most recently deceased
person in the community even if that person was not of the same sex. Further-more, several newborn babies may be given the same Yup’ik name if they are allborn before another death has occurred. A person who has the same name as one
is one’s atellgun ‘name-sharer.’ This may be the reason that the same name maybe found in different, often widely separated villages, though it may also be as inEnglish that there are just some names that are fairly common in the particularethnic group.
Yup’ik names are sometimes common nouns as well. For example, there are
people named Arnaq ‘woman.’ However, many names, for example Tukayak,
are not analyzable. Some names are analyzable only by going outside the villagewhere they are found. For example, there are people named Ikusek in lower
Kuskokwim villages, where this word is “just a name,” but outside this areaikusek is the word for ‘elbow,’ while in the lower Kuskokwim cingun, literally‘device for pushing’ is used for ‘elbow.’
It is thought that this is because of an old pre-Christian naming taboo
practice. According to this theory, after a person had died his name would not beuttered until a newborn baby had received that name. If the name was also a
common noun, such as a word for ‘elbow,’ then a new noun was coined for thatthing until such time as the old word could safely be used again when the
temporary coined word would be discarded. Sometimes, however, the coinage
remained in use and the old formerly common noun became just a personal
name. Evidence for this is that many of the nouns used only in particular areas(usually the lower Kuskokwim and Bristol Bay) where the noun used elsewherefor that thing is a person name, are descriptive word coinings as in the case ofcingun discussed above. Also the practice of name taboo had been observed in
pre-Christian times in various Eskimo communities, and the retention of
substitute common nouns in the manner described above was observed in
practice in East Greenland in the late 1800s.","[446, 447]"
"368GRAMMAROF CENTRAL ALASKANYUP IKIn the preceding three examples, the words taum, im’um and
qikertam are
relative possessors of the nouns ¥ ayuqucig ‘what something is like,’
V cauciq ‘whatsomething is,’ and ¥ elucig ‘the form of something.’The combination of +ta- ‘to (be)V to a certain (indicated) extent’
(see Chapter
14), and @:(u)ciq gives +taciq ‘degree to which possessor is
V .’
Alqama aptellruanga qaill’ angtacirpenek. ‘My older sister
asked me
your size (how big you are).’
Kuigem iqtutacia nalluaqa. ‘I don’t know how wide the river
is.’
Compare the following:Aptellruanga sugtucirpenek aatavtun. ‘He asked me if you
are tall like
your father.’Aptellruanga sugtutacirpenek aatavtun. ‘He asked me if you are
as tall
as your father.’
Aptellruanga qaill’ sugtutacirpenek. ‘He asked me how
tall you are.’
Aptellruanga sugtunrucirpenek aatavni. ‘He asked me if
you are taller
than your father.’In manycases this postbaseonly partially nominalizesverbs,for mostspeakers. Rather than having a relative case possessor, a form
derived with this
postbase has a subject for its “embedded” verb:
Qanrusnga ciin tauna qgimugta qiluucianek. ‘Tell me why
that dog is
barking’ (tauna qimugta is the absolutive subject of the
embedded
intransitive verb: ciin qilugta?).
Be aware that for ‘tell me why that dog is barking’ some
speakers willsay
qanrusnga ciin taum qimugtem qiluucianek instead
of the above with
taum qimugtem as relative possessor of the derived
noun qiluucianek, justasa relativepossessoris usedwithayuqucia(nek),caucia(nek), and
elucia(nek). The acceptability of these two differ
ent patterns, absolutive as
subject of embedded intransitive verb and relative as
possessor of derived noun,
is similar to the acceptability in English of both ‘I heard
about you being sick’ and
also ‘I heard
about your being sick.’If the “embedded” sentence is transitive, then its subje
ct goes fromrelative
to terminalis case. This is another instance of the
terminalis case as sub ject ofanembeddedtransitive verb (see also Chapter18). Thus:CHAPTER TWENTY369Qanrusnga ciin taumun qimugteniun qiluucianek irniaqa. ‘Tell me
why that dog is barking at my child.’ (Embedded sentence: ciin taum
gimugtem qilugtau irniaqa?)
With this postbase future is expressed with the noun-to-noun postbase +kaq(Chapter 14) coming after the postbase in question, rather than with the verbto-verb postbase +ciqe-/@ciiqe- coming before it:
Aptellruanga natmun ayaucirkamnek unuaqu. ‘He asked me where I
would go tomorrow (ayaucirkamnek is preferred to ayagciqucimnek).","[377, 378, 379]"
"Words Borrowed into Yup’ik
Before the arrival of the Russians to the Yup’ik areas, the Yup’ik languageprobably had relatively few words “borrowed” from other languages (compared
to the situation with European languages for example). There are however a
number of words, mostly animal and fish names, that are borrowed form Aleut
(which must be distinguished from words, called “cognates,” common to Aleut
and Yup’ik which go back to proto-Eskimo-Aleut times). These borrowings
include cagiq/sagig ‘halibut,’ uginagq ‘sea lion, issurigq ‘hair seal,’ and perhaps
issaluugq ‘porcupine’ (in Aleut this word means ‘birds take off in flight’; if the
Yup’ik word is in fact borrowed from Aleut, it could be because Yup’iks hold the
belief common elsewhere as well that porcupines shoot out their quills). There
are only a few Athabaskan words borrowed into Yup’ik, including luqruuyak,
the lower Kuskokwim word for ‘pike-fish,’ and nuuniq, a word for ‘porcupine’
used at the mouth of the Yukon. There are four Chukchi loans from Siberia:
kalikagq ‘paper,’ qusngiq ‘reindeer’ or ‘sheep,’ kuingigq ‘pipe, cigarette,’ and
qalqapak ‘axe.’
The Russians brought new foods, tools, articles of clothing, domestic items,religious doctrines, and domesticated animals. For these the Yup’iks generally
borrowed the Russian terms. Russian loans number about two hundred, though
certainly no speaker of Yup’ik uses all of them.! With one or two exceptions,
Russian loan words in Yup’ik are only nouns, not verbs, nor particles.
The Russian words were adapted to the Eskimo sound system, for exampleby replacing Russian “r’s (which are like English “r’s though rolled), with 1 (as
in Yup’ik piilitsaaq from Russian pérets, or kuluvak ‘cow’ from Russian
koroéva) or at the beginning of a word with al (as in Yupik Alussistuaq
9)
‘Christmas’ from Russian ré6dzhestvo) and replacing Russian 6 “o”s
with u (as in
Yup’ik mulut’uuk ‘hammer’ from Russian molot6k). Russian unstressed “o” is
pronounced as “a” or shwa in some, but not all, Russian dialects, and this Russiandialect situation is sometimes reflected in the Yup’ik loans (as in the two Yupik

"Yup’ik demonstrative pronouns, like the English demonstrative pronouns
‘this’ and ‘that,’ can take the place of nouns or function alongside of other nouns asappositives. Thus, just as in English one can say both ‘this is dirty’ and ‘this tableis dirty,’ so in Yup’ik one can say una iqauq and una estuulug iqauq. In thefirst of these two Yup’ik sentences, una is the subject of the sentence, while in
the second both una and estuuluq are the subject, and are appositives.
Inflection of Demonstrative PronounsJust as the English words ‘this’ and ‘that’ have special irregular plurals
‘these’ and ‘those’, so in Yup’ik the plurals of the demonstratives are not formed
by merely attaching the ending %:(e)t as with ordinary nouns, nor, for example,
is the ablative-modalis formed by merely attaching ~%mek.",[88]

We have seen how for a 3rd person possessor the oblique cases, that is all
cases other than the absolutive and relative, are formed from the 3rd person
absolutive plus an oblique case marker. For 1st and 2nd person possessors the
oblique cases are formed from a shortened version of the relative case endings
discussed plus an oblique case marker, and attach to noun bases in the same way
as those relative éase endings do. The n forms, rather than the m forms, of the
localis, terminalis and ablative-modalis endings are used as with 3rd person
(that is ni for localis, nun for terminalis). Thus, for example, the localis endings
are -mni ‘in my —(s)’, -mterfi ‘in our —(s)’, -vni/+peni ‘in your; —(s), and -vcerii/
+pecerii ‘in yourp| —(s)’. The other oblique cases are formed similarly. See

"Nouns as Subjects of Verbs
A noun in its citation form (and in other absolutive forms) can serve as the
subject of a verb in the 3rd person as discussed in Chapter 2. Note that the
citation form is singular so the verb must be singular too. In the next chapter we
shall see how to form absolutive plural and dual. Some examples of nouns being
used as subjects of verbs are:Angun ner’ug. ‘The man is eating.’
Uluag assirtuq. ‘The semi-lunar knife is good.’
Arnaq qavaryugtuq. ‘The woman wants to sleep.’Yuk-qaa pissurtuq? ‘Is the person hunting?’
Cali-qaa kuimaryugtugq mikelnguq? ‘Does the child still want to swim?’
Yup’ik arnaq yurartugq. ‘The Eskimo woman is dancing.’
Appositives
In the last example above, both Yup’ik and arnaq are the subject; the twowords are said to be appositives, meaning that they fill the same role in the
sentence and stand for the same thing. Appositives play a big role in Yup’ik, in
part providing the apparatus that serves the same function as adjectives in
English.",[41]
"Demonstrative Adverbs
Just as in English there are demonstrative pronouns (“this,” “that”) whichare used for things, and demonstrative adverbs (“here,” “there”) which are used
for locations, so in Yup’ik corresponding to each demonstrative pronoun there isa demonstrative adverb. With some exceptions and/or modifications, the demonstrative adverb base is derived from the fundamental demonstrative base by
adding a, sometimes with velar dropping having occurred as a historical process.
There are no absolutive case forms nor is there a singular/plural/dual
distinction for demonstrative adverbs.
The ending for the localis is +ni, just like the ordinary plural localis ending.",[91]
"This postbase is also used with a very few verb bases:
assir- ‘to be good
cuka- ‘to be fast*assirite- —> assiite‘to lack goodness’
*cukangite-—> cukaite-\ assiitug ‘it is bad’
\V cukaitugq ‘it is slow’‘to lack speed’
As the check marks indicate, these two expanded bases, assiite- ‘to be bad,’and cukaite- ‘to be slow,’ should be memorized as vocabulary.
Ablative-modalis of Specification
Closely related to the use of the ablative-modalis case for the indefinite object is
the use of this case to give specific information about a noun inside a verb, that is, anoun which has on it a postbase such as -li- ‘to make,’ -ngqerr- ‘to have,’ or :(ng)ite‘to not have.’ Some examples of this specification use of the ablative-modalis case are:
Suupaliug tuntuvagmek. ‘She’s making moose soup.’Kass’amek uinggertugq. ‘She has a white husband.’

*kuigtgun, since the middle consonant ist, an e is inserted after this consonant
rather than before it. The g after the inserted e remains voiceless and must be
written double.
Equalis Case
The other case is the equalis, the ending of which is %tun in the singular and%cetun in the plural. It essentially has only one use and means ‘like (a) N’. This
use has been extended to include ‘in the language of N’ as the examples below
illustrate.","[83, 84]"
"Relative Case as Possessor
Forms such as kuuvviara can also have an explicitly stated possessor, like
“the man’s” in “the man’s coffee is hot” in English. In Yup’ik such a possessor will
be put in the relative case. The unpossessed relative singular ending is %:(e)m,which attaches just like the unpossessed absolutive plural ending %:(e)t. The
unpossessed relative plural and dual endings are exactly the same as the
unpossessed absolutive plural and dual endings, %:(e)t, and %:(e)k.
Examples
Angutem kuuvviara uuqnarquq. ‘The man’s coffee is hot.’Arnam apa’urlua keggutaituq. ‘The woman’s grandfather doesn’t have
teeth.’
Qimugtem pamyua nanitugq. ‘The dog’s tail is short.’Angutet nuussiit ipegtut. ‘The men’s knives are sharp.’
Kanani nanvam cikua mamtuudq. ‘Down there the lake’s ice is thick.’
Imarpiim cersiii tak’uq cakneq. ‘The shore of the sea is very long’ or ‘The
sea’s shore is very long.’
Egatem patua iqaugq. ‘The lid of the pot is dirty’ or ‘The pot’s lid is dirty.’
The last two examples above illustrate how a possessor can be rendered in
English by a prepositional phrase
possessive in apostrophe and “s.”with“of” ratherthanwiththeEnglishThe relative singular of a demonstrative pronoun is formed by adding m to
the singular non-absolutive intermediate base (see Chapter 6). For example:94GRAMMAROF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIKUum suupam tepii assirtuq. ‘The aroma of this soup is good.’
Aug’um uinga elitnauristeriguugq. ‘Thatgoing away person’s husband is a
teacher.’
Taum patua iqaugq. ‘That one’s lid is dirty.’
Notice that grammatical agreement in number goes in both directions, to
possessor and to verb, when the possessor of a possessed noun is explicitly given:
Arnam qimugtii qilugtuq. ‘The woman’s dog is barking.’
Arnam qimugtai qilugtut. ‘The woman’s dogs are barking.’
Arnat qimugtiit qilugtuq. ‘The women’s dog is barking.’
Arnat qimugtait qilugtut. ‘The women’s dogs are barking.’
The relative plural and dual of demonstrative pronouns are just like the
absolutive plural and dual. For example:
Ukut egatet iqaut. ‘These pots are dirty’ (ukut is absolutive as subject
along with egatet).
Ukut egatet patuit iqaut. ‘The lids of these pots are dirty’ (ukut is relative
as possessor appositive to egatet).","[103, 104]"

Rather, the velar ng, g, or ris dropped ifand only if itis flanked by single vowels,
and this explains why the velar is kept in uingite- and qairite-. In the case of*neqengite- becoming neqaite-, there is a general rule whereby engi becomes
ai when the ng is velar-dropped.
Another general rule says that when a suffix that starts with a vowel is added to
a base ending in er or eg, then the e of the base (called the semi-final e) is dropped.
nater- ‘floor’natrite- (velar kept)natrituq ‘it lacks a floor’GRAMMAR38OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIKIf this leads to a three-consonant cluster, then an e is reinserted, but a velarfollowing such a reinserted e is not subject to velar-dropping. The e may bereinserted between the first and second consonants of the cluster or between the
second and third.asver- ‘walrus’*asvrite- (velar kept)
—> asverite- or
asevrite-asveritug or asevritugq ‘it lacks
walruses’The word nuliag ‘wife’ is a special case. The base can be regarded as either
nuliar-, in which case this postbase gives nuliarite-, or as nulirr-,in which case
this postbase gives nulirrite-, and velar dropping does not apply to the voiceless
fricative. Both nuliaritug and nulirritug are common for ‘he doesn’t have a wife.’
Lexicalizations
Some combinations of this postbase with particular bases should be considered as bases in their own right and should be learned as such just as if they were
words presented in the vocabulary section of the chapter. This happens withother postbases as well as with the one in question. These combinations are said
to be lexicalized which is to say that the meaning of the combination in questionis not totally predictable from the meanings of the individual parts. English also
has many lexicalizations including “washing machine,” which is understood not
as any machine for washing anything, but specifically as a machine for washingclothes, and “hot dog,” which of course isn’t a dog at all. In this book lexicalized
combinations will be indicated with a checkmark, that is, with the symbol ”
For example, kemek ‘flesh’ and the postbase :(ng)ite- (with an ending) lead to
V kemgituq which means literally ‘she doesn’t have meat or flesh’, but which is
understood by Yup’ik speakers as meaning ‘she is skinny.’ The base V kemgiteis considered to be lexicalized because ‘to be skinny’ is not entirely predictable
from the literal meaning ‘to not have meat or flesh.’ The reader should memorizekemgitug ‘she is skinny’ as another verb in the vocabulary of this chapter.
The same check mark will be used for combinations where the meaning is
predictable but which correspond to a single English word or concept and
therefore should also be memorized as bases in their own right. An example of
this is that imag ‘contents’ and the postbase in question (with an ending) yield
V imaituq ‘it does not have contents’ which (predictably) corresponds to the
English ‘it is empty.’ The check mark indicates that imaitugq should be memorized as the Yup’ik verb for ‘it is empty.’ That way when translating from Englishto Yup’ik one won't always have to follow this chain of thoughts: “empty’ equals
‘not have contents,’ ‘contents’ is imaq and ‘not have’ is :(ng)ite-, so ‘not have
contents’ is imaite-, and therefore that is the Yup’ik for ‘empty” (nor should onehave to follow a similar multi-step chain of thoughts to get from the Yup’ik
imaite- tothe the English ‘empty’), but rather go from ‘empty’ directly to imaite-(and likewise going from Yup’ik to English).","[47, 48]"
"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR439a Russian “loan sound” introduced into the language (as happened in Aleut
andAlutiiq which now have Russian (or English) “r’s in their loan words from
Russian). Vowel length and consonant gemination in the Yup’ik word wasformulated so as to duplicate the stress of the Russian original where possible
.
This has led to a very distinctive stress pattern in Russian loan words; they tendto have long (doubled) vowels and often unusual gemination or lack of gemination, though never anything which the pre-existent phonology of Yup’ik could not
handle. Examples of this are yaassiik ‘box,’ kuluk’uunagq ‘bell,’ luuskaaq
‘spoon,’ kula’avkaagq ‘safety pin’ and and kuulicaag ‘chicken.’ Some Russianloan words start with 1, which is extremely rare in non-loan words; examples
ofsuch loan words are laavkaagq ‘store,’ and lumarrag ‘shirt, cloth.’A number ofloan words from Russian begin with st but for many people the Yup’ik form
hasacquired a voiceless barely audible e before the cluster, for example estuuluq
‘table’ (from Russian sto/).
In contrast to the ready borrowing by Aleuts and Alutiiqs, hardly ever wasa Russianword adopted by Yup’iks for something with which Yup’iks werefamiliar before the arrival of the Russians. One counter-example, however, isuutkaagq ‘pintail duck’ (from Russian utka) used on the Yukon.
In some cases, a new word has been coined for a new thing, rather than or
inaddition to borrowing a Russian word. For example, ‘pencil’ is igarcuun or
alngarcuun (literally ‘device for marking or decorating’). Pencils were introduced by the Russians, or at least while there were Russians still in Alaska after
1867, but these Yup’ik coined words are more common in most areas than the
Russian loan for pencil, kalantaaassaq (from Russian karanddsh). In some
cases a Yup’ik word acquired a new meaning. For example, nutek ‘gun’
and
nuteg- ‘to shoot with a gun’ evidently formerly referred to the explosion of a
pocket of pitch in a burning piece of spruce wood.

For the form of the ablative-modalis case used in Hooper Bay and Chevak,
see Note A in the supplement for this chapter.
As observed above, the object in the ablative-modalis case in these construc-tions is something indefinite, and for this reason it is translated without the
definite article “the.” Thus ner’uq neqmek means ‘he is eating fish,’ ‘he is eating
a fish’ or ‘he is eating some fish.’ To translate ‘he is eating the fish’ into Yup’ik
requires a different construction which will be dealt with in Chapter 8. Similarly
to say ‘I saw you’ or ‘he saw me’ where the object is 1st or 2nd person (and thus
a definite thing) also requires that different construction.","[43, 44]"
"#15 The word suupagq ‘soup, stew’ is from Russian reinfo
rced by English.
#16 With the base tangerr., ‘to see,’ the postbase -nrite‘to not V yields both the predictable
form tangenrituq and also tangenrrituq for ‘he doesn’t
see.’ Both forms are common. In
the second form, apparently the voicelessness of the
base-final back velar fricative is42GRAMMAROF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIKtransferred to the same fricative in the postbase.
#17 The word uluagq ‘semi-lunar knife, woman’s traditional Eskimo-style knife’ has entered
English (or at least the English or writers and speakers about Eskimo things) in the form
of its Inupiaq cognate “ulu.” Instead of uluaq, the word kegginalek is used in HBC and
Nun. In Can the word uluagq is used for any type of cutting knife.
#18 The word yuk ‘person’ is pronounced, and therefore spelled, cuk in Chevak (but not in
Hooper Bay where it is yuk), and in Nun (actually pronounced with a voiceless g rather than
k), Almost all words which elsewhere begin with y followed by a single vowel begin with c
in HBC, Nun and Eg. This word becomes suk in some small parts of Y. The meaning of yuk
is broader than just ‘person,’ it can mean ‘child’ in the sense of ‘offspring,’ “Yupik Eskimo,’
or ‘animating spirit’ in certain contexts.
#19 The word yup’ik means literally ‘real person’ or more accurately perhaps ‘authentic person’
or ‘our original kind of person.’ In Chevak (and Nun) this word is cup’ik, and some people
in K and BB prefer yupiaq since there -piag rather than -pik is the more common postbase
for ‘real, authentic N.’Note A
In the HBC dialect the ablative-modalis case endings are ~%meng and ~%neng instead of
~%mek and ~%nek as elsewhere. So HBC says, for example, akutameng neryugtua for ‘I wantto eat Eskimo ice cream,’ and tumneng tangertua for ‘I see some tracks.’Note B
We've seen how a word formed with the postbase -li-, ‘to make,’ can be shortened by deleting
1 and the preceding vowel, so that suupaliuten-qaa? ‘are you making soup?’ can be shortenedto suupiuten-qaa? There is a special problem when a noun ends in two vowels followed by aconsonant. An example of such a noun is kuuvviag ‘coffee.’ The long form for ‘are you making
coffee?’ is kuuvvialiuten-qaa? but a short form also exists for some, but not all, Yup’ik speakers.
The expanded base kuuvviali- ‘to make coffee,’ can be shortened to kuuvvii-, and then, when
using an ending such as +(g/t)uten, it is necessary to use the (g) after the two vowels:
kuuvviiguten-qaa? ‘are you making coffee?’Note C
Hatted e will not be deleted if doing so leads to a cluster of two same consonants, and an e
will be inserted to break such a cluster which may arise through word construction with an e
dropping suffix (such as ~%mek). Thus one will not get pp, mm, etc. in a word. This same holds
for clusters of “almost same” consonants, in particular the clusters ct and cn.
However, in the HBC dialect such same and almost same clusters are permitted. For clarity,
and to avoid ambiguity in some cases, an apostrophe is used to separate the two like consonants.
Thus in HBC *quaguléliyugtua does lead to quagul’liyugtua ‘I want to make a three-edged
needle,’ and tum’meng rather than tumemek (as elsewhere) is the singular ablative-modalisof tuma®. The clusters I’l and m’m here are different from geminated ] and geminated m in that
breath is released for a very short duration of time between the two I's or two m’s of the cluster.
In the NSU dialect hatted e is not deleted even between unlike consonants, but rather the
consonant following the e is always geminated. People there would say urluveliyugtua for ‘I
want to make a bow.’ Furthermore, in the NSU dialect many e’s come to the surface, so to speak,within morphemes in places where they have been deleted as hatted in other dialects and where
their underlying existence would be at best suspected without recourse to NSU (and/or Eskimo
languages other than Central Yup’ik). For example, non-NSU Central Yup’ik has it’gaq ‘foot’
where the voiced status of g (as indicated by the apostrophe) suggests a deleted hatted e between
it and t. Siberian Yupik itegaq and Inupiaq/Inuit isigak or itigak for ‘foot’ add evidence of this,
and indeed NSU has itegaq.","[51, 52]"

"276GRAMMAROF CENTRAL ALASKANYUP IKCase Determination for Subject and Object of Dependent Moods
Consider sentences where the dependent verb has either a 4th person subject
or object and differs in transitivity from the main verb. For example, upcugtuq
maligpailegmiten ‘she wants to get ready before she goes with you,’ or
upceugtug maligpailegpeni ‘she wants to get ready before you go with her’ or
upcugaanga ayagpailegmi ‘she wants to get me ready before she leaves.’ Now,
ifthe ‘she’ is specified by a noun or pronoun, then the case of that noun or pronoun
is generally determined by the main verb rather than by the dependent verb. So
one says upcugtuq imna maligpailegmiten that person wants to get ready before she
goes with you’ (rather than *upcugtuq im’um maligpailegmiten), and
similarly one says upcugtuq imna maligpailegpeni and upcugaangaim’umayagpailegmi.
Reference of 4th Person Possessor Possessed Noun Associated with
Dependent Verb
A 4th person subject of a dependent verb (or possessor of the subject) willrefer back to the 3rd person subject of the main verb:
Angun anellruugq getunrani nervailgan. ‘The man went out before his
(the man’s) son ate’ (vs. angun anellruugq qetunraa nervailgan ‘the
man went out before his (another’s) son ate’).
Angun anellruuq qetunrami nuliara nervailgan. ‘The man went out
before his (the man’s) son’s wife ate.’
A 4th person ending on the object or on anything else associated with a
dependent verb other than the subject (or the possessor of the subject), will referback to the 3rd person subject of the dependent verb, not of the main verb.
Angun anellruugq arnam neqliurpailgaku anngani. ‘The man went out
before the woman served her (the woman’s, not the man’s) brother’ (vs.angun anellruuq arnam neqliurpailgaku anngaa ‘the man went

"The other two main missionary groups that worked among the Yup’iks
, that
is, the Moravian Protestants and the Roman Catholics, also had
writing systems
in which they printed prayer books, and — in the case of the Moravi
ans — Bibletranslations. These writing systems use Roman letters someti
mes with diacrit-ics. The Moraviansystemwasadapted from the KleinschmidtsystemforGreenlandic Eskimo, and the Catholic system, though develo
ped separately,
was similar (see page 218). Actually there were at least two
Catholicsystems, oneon Nelson Island and one on the Yukon, and the Moravian system
went throughsome changes over the years. These missionary writing system
s rarely differen-tiated k from q consistently, did not adequately deal with the vowel
e nor withrhythmic length or automatic gemination. N. or, for that matter,
were these writingssystems internally consistent; a word would be written one wayin one place anda slightly different way in another place. Even so, a number
of people learned toread and write Yup’ik in these systems, using them not only
for religious
purposes but also for writing public announcements, recording the
minutes and
determinations of village councils, and for writing letters back
and forth (see
page 286). I do not know of any cases where these writing systems
were used fordiaries, nonfiction, or creative writing, though there may
be some such somewhere. There are still many people who can read and write
in the Moravian and
Catholic systems.",[457]
"Contractions with the Obsolete Verb Base eteJust as English has “you'll” as a contraction of “you will,” and “don’t” as a
contraction of “do not,” Yup’ik has a process of contraction. In the Yup’ik case,
however, the underlying uncontracted two-word form is not used in most areas.
Eskimo has a verb base ete-, meaning simply ‘to be,’ which is not used by itself
at the present time (in most Central Yup’ik areas). However, contractions of thisbase and the localis case are very common. For example, to say ‘itis in the village’,
one can say nunami uitaugq (literally ‘it is situated in the village’), but one can
also say nunametugq which comes from an obsolete two-word phrase nunami
etuq. The two words have joined together in present-day Yup’ik. To say ‘it is up
above,’ one can say, of course, pikani uitauq or, from obsolete pikani etug one
can get pikanetugq, and, this undergoes one further change, which occurs only
1. This base ete- ‘to be’ can be used by itselfin Nun and to some extent in HBC, and also itis found
in Christian prayers translated into Yup’ik 75 to 100 years ago such as the following (in the
modern orthography) from the Moravian Brethren hymnal, Yuarutet: Tuaten piqarraami
etellruuq, watua-llu etuq eterrlainararkauluni-llu akwanun ‘Thus He (God) was in the
beginning, is now, and always will be forever.’ This is good evidence that the base in questioncould be used independently in Lower Kuskokwim Yup’ik until relatively recently.",[94]
"‘It is thatheavy’(fromuqamaite-;uqamaltaugq is irregular in that iis dropped, but it is more common than
the regular form uqamailtaugq).
Comparatives and the Localis of Comparison
The postbase -nru- means ‘to be V-er.’ The object of the comparison (if
explicitly stated) can be indicated by a noun in the localis case, comparison use:Una assinruugq. ‘This one is better.’
Sugtunruunga aatamni. ‘I am taller than my father.’
Uqurinruunga kinguglimni. ‘I am fatter than my younger sibling.’
Nengllinruuq akwaugami. It is colder than yesterday.’ (Note the use of the
localis of comparison with the word akwaugagq which is normally an
uninflectable particle.)
This postbase can be used with transitive endings when used on certain
transitive-only verbs.",[267]
