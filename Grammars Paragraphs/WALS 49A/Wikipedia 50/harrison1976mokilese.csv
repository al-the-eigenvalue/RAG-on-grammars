"1.1 SOUND AND SPELLING
It is important not to confuse speech sounds with writing.
Writing is a way of representing language on paper. It allows
us to communicate ideas and descriptions of events to people
in places and at times far removed from the places and times
where these ideas originated. Thus, it is possible for a person
on Mokil to read about events that took place in Honolulu or in
Washington and to find out about the ideas of people who lived
many hundreds of years ago.
Although writing represents language, it does not necessarily represent the sounds of language. For example, in the
case of the Chinese writing system that uses symbols to represent whole words, a Chinese will be able to look at a character
and pronounce the word it represents, but he will not be able to
say that any part of the character stands for a specific sound of
that word.
Most of the world’s languages use alphabetic writing
systems. (The name comes from the first two letters of the
Greek alphabet—alpha and beta.) In such systems, the symbols
used are meant to represent sounds. For example, in the English
word cat, most of us would agree that there are three sounds
which are represented by the three letters c-a-t. In fact, phoneticians (people who study speech sounds) tell us that speech
is actually a more or less continuous stream of sound, so that it
is often very difficult to tell where one sound ends and the next
begins. If this is true, it is not surprising that sounds can be affected by the sounds surrounding them, as we shall see below.",[32]
"11 The Phonology of Mokilese
Even though speech is continuous, it is still convenient for us
to try to cut up the stream of speech sounds into segments, a
segment being what most of us would agree is a single sound.
Even alphabetic systems do not always represent sounds accurately or consistently. In English, for example, the same symbols are often used to represent very different sounds, as in the
case of the ou in thought, though and through. The same is true
in Mokilese, where e is used to represent different sounds in
ngenin ‘his spirit’ and jed ‘sea water’. 1 A string of symbols is
often used to represent what is phonetically a single sound. This
is true in the case of the th 2 in the English words thought and
though mentioned above and in Mokilese in the case of the ng
in ngen, which is phonetically the single sound [ŋ].
As is probably very obvious by now, we will often find it necessary to represent speech sounds more accurately than the
writing system does. For this purpose we will use PHONETIC
SYMBOLS. Phonetic TRANSCRIPTION (as this phonetic representation is called) will always be enclosed in square brackets [ ] to
distinguish it from ORTHOGRAPHY (as the normal spelling system
is called), which will always be in italics. Thus, ngen [ŋɛn]
‘spirit’.","[32, 33]"
"Kamwa Davy inla duhdu.
‘You and Davy went swimming.’In example 88, the dual pronoun kamwa ‘you two’ is used where
a total of two people is involved, the hearer and Davy.
89. Kama John pirin raunla.
‘John and I are going to go for a stroll.’
The dual pronoun kama ‘we two (exclusive)’ is used in 89,
where once again only two people are involved, the speaker and
John. This differs markedly from the English usage, where the
pronoun would refer to the people involved, minus the person
or people referred to by the noun.
The remote plural pronouns appear to be used very little in
Mokilese. In most cases, they may be replaced by the corresponding plural pronouns. The remote pronouns refer to groups
of people, usually large, and most of which are probably not directly present when being discussed. Thus, kihs ‘we’ refers to
the speaker, the hearer, and a large group of people not present
at the time of the conversation. Similarly, kimi ‘we’ refers to the
speaker and to a group of others not present; kimwi ‘you’, to
the hearer and others not present, and ihr ‘they’ to a group of
people not present.
Since kihs, for example, commonly refers to very large
groups of people, it is often used to refer to all the people of
Mokil or to the whole human race.
90. Kihs joh kak mine pohn jampah ma joh joau.
‘We couldn’t live on the earth if there were no sun.’82Mokilese Reference Grammar
It is very common for the remote plural pronouns to be used
in generic habitual sentences (with the modal kin—see 7.1.6)
that refer to the activities of a class of people, animals, or objects. For example:
91.Oaujoangoan daknohioaw kimi kin wia, kimi kin daknohki
palwahr.
‘One kind of surfing we do is body surfing.’
92.Koaroa kin pokonpene pohn pik. Anjoauo ma ihr kin sangda,
ihr kin jokpijoang roahmen roahmen, jokla ekij wija roapoan
kanahr mwinge.
‘The koaroa often gather together on the sand. When they
fly away, they separate into two’s and fly off a short distance
in search of food.’3.4.1.3 PRE-PREDICATE PRONOUNS
As indicated in the chart of personal pronouns above there
are two forms for the first and second person singular pronouns—the regular forms ngoahi and koawoa and the special
pre-predicate 7 forms ngoah and koah. These latter forms are
used most often as sentence subjects (see 6.1), as in:
93.Ngoah pel inenin koapwoarpwoarki pwa me ohroj men nen
pel mwehu.
‘I also hope very much that everything there is fine too.’
94.Koah ne kidal pwa ia ngoah inla.
‘You already know where I’m going.’
The pre-predicate pronouns may also be used before ma (see
12.3.2) in sentences like:
95. Ngoah ma wia mehu.
‘I was the one who did that.’
96. Koah ma John kioang pukko.
‘You were the one John gave that book to.’
97. I oar koah ma ngoah kapang aio.
‘It was you I saw yesterday.’833 Nouns and Reference
In other circumstances, ngoahi and koawoa are used.

"Figure 1: Family TreexxiiIntroduction
Languages can be shown to be related (in the sense described above) to the extent that they resemble one another.
The fact that most of the languages of Micronesia are related is
obvious if we compare words in those languages. For example:
MokilesePonapeanKusaieanTrukeseMarshalleseGilbertese‘day’rehnrahnlwenraanrahan—‘hand’poapehpo—paybai‘to chew’mehmemehmemɛmɛmanimɛymɛy—‘away’-la-la-lac-na-laqlako‘outside’likin—lihkinnukunliyik—‘to drink’nimnimnihmwún úminime-nima‘where’iaiayaciyayiyahia‘blood’insantasrahcchadararaa‘coconut’ninihnunuuniyni‘shark’pakopakoapahkopók ópakewpakoa‘eye’majmaasmuhtamaasmajmata‘to hear’rongronglohngrongr ̋eg̋rogorogo‘to vomit’umwwujmmwuswohtmmwusḿḿɛjmumuta‘forehead’soamwe—motonsrochaamwdaḿramwaThese and many other words are very similar in all the languages that we call Micronesian, while the English words with
the same meaning are very different. From this we can conclude
that all the Micronesian languages are related (belong to the
same language family), while English is not related to the Micronesian languages, but belongs to a different language family.
Within the Micronesian family some languages seem to be
more closely related than others. It is obvious that Mokilese
and Pingelapese are very closely related, since a speaker of one
language can understand the other language with no difficulty.
Both Pingelapese and Mokilese are closely related to Ponapean.
Beyond this, however, it is difficult to say which Micronesian
languages are more closely related to which others. The family
tree shown in figure 2 gives a rather simplified picture of the
Micronesian language family, with special attention given to
those Micronesian languages most closely related to Mokilese.
When we compare words in Micronesian languages with
words from other languages in the Pacific, it becomes clear
that Micronesian languages belong to an even larger family
containing many hundreds of languages. This family has been
called Austronesian and includes Polynesian languages (likexxiiiIntroduction
Hawaiian, Samoan, and the languages of Nukuoro and Kapingamarangi); most of the languages of the Solomon Islands and the
New Hebrides, to the south of Micronesia; the languages of the
Philippine Islands, a few languages spoken on Taiwan, the languages of Indonesia and even of the island of Madagascar, off
the coast of Africa. (This last large group of languages has been
called Indonesian and includes Palauan and Chamorro, both of
which are spoken within what is geographically Micronesia.)Figure 2: Micronesian Linguistic RelationshipsThese relationships become obvious if we compare a few
common Austronesian words in languages as far apart as Mokilese, Hawaiian, and Indonesian.

words, while the corresponding English words are very different. This leads us to conclude that English is not a member
of the Austronesian family.
The exact nature of the relationships among languages in
the Austronesian family is not clear. Figure 3 gives a simplified,
and perhaps a not entirely correct, picture of what these relationships might be. Only more detailed comparison of all the
languages concerned will give us a clearer picture.xxivIntroductionFigure 3: Austronesian Languages0.3 BORROWING
Contact between peoples often leads to changes in language.
The most obvious of such changes is the adoption of new words
borrowed from other languages. Mokilese has borrowed large
numbers of words from the languages of foreigners who have
come to Micronesia, as well as from other Micronesian languages. The two earliest European rulers of Micronesia—the
Spanish and the Germans—left very few words in Mokilese.
Some that were borrowed from Spanish are pwohla ‘ball’ and
mihsa ‘mass’. The only words that seem to have been borrowed
from German are dois ‘Germany’ and mahk ‘mark, German
money’. In contrast, however, there are many hundreds of
words of Japanese and English origin that have found their way
into Mokilese.
0.3.1 Japanese Borrowings
The Japanese introduced many new foods, games, tools, articles
of clothing, plants, and government institutions which are reflected today in the fact that Japanese words are still used for
many of these objects and concepts. Among the food names that
were borrowed from Japanese are:
aiskeiki‘popsicle’ (originally borrowed by Japanese from the
English ‘ice cake’)
dakuang ‘pickled radish’
juangke ‘lime drink’
kimji
‘pickled cabbage’
kiuhri
‘cucumber’
miso
‘bean paste’
ningi
‘green onion’
ramen
‘noodles’
sasimi
‘raw fish’xxvIntroduction
Names for field sports such as jumping and racing, and especially baseball and the words associated with it, have been borrowed almost totally from Japanese. Most of the baseball terms
were originally borrowed by Japanese from English. Examples
of Japanese sports terms used in Mokilese are:
apa dopi
daka dopi
damaski
iakumehda
iakiu
omiddo
padda
okes
wannangge
middo‘broad jump’
‘high jump’
‘pool’
‘hundred meter race’
‘baseball’
‘out of bounds’
‘baseball bat’
‘substitute player’
‘shotput’
‘catcher’s mit’Japanese words for tools and other implements are common in
Mokilese.
dama
dapang
depwehra
jawang
kua
kama
kansophpa
kingko
jidohsa
ohdai
penehda
supwo‘light bulb’
‘chopping board’
‘file’
‘rice bowl’
‘hoe’
‘sickle’
‘copra drying shed’
‘safe’
‘car’
‘bandage’
‘plywood’
‘pile of firewood’Some names of clothing are of Japanese origin.
aramaki
dehpwukro
jarmada
kuspara
pwundoji
sohri‘belly band’
‘gloves’
‘underwear’
‘shoehorn’
‘loincloth’

ansu
‘apricot tree’
masnoki ‘ironwood tree’
apwraiaji‘kind of pine tree’
dohng
‘kind of tree used for
lumber’
Terms for certain government and civil institutions have still
survived from Japanese times.
aikiu
jikeng
kadaiking
pehnggohsi
rahkudai‘dole’
‘test’
‘public work’
‘defender’
‘to fail, to be demoted’These are by no means all the words of Japanese origin that are
used in Mokilese, but they do represent a fair sampling. Today,
however, the trend is away from the use of Japanese words.
Many are known only by older people, and large numbers are
being replaced by recent borrowings from English. For example, for ‘telephone’ young people would be more likely to use
the English borrowing delpwohn than the Japanese dengwa.
0.3.2 English Borrowings
The largest foreign segment of the Mokilese vocabulary seems
to be words of English origin. Words borrowed from English can
be divided into two types: an older set, learned from whalers,
traders and missionaries in the nineteenth century; and a recent
set, introduced since the American administration began at the
end of World War II. It is often possible to tell these two segments apart on the basis of the form the words take in Mokilese.
Thus, for example, in older English loanwords, English t regularly becomes s in Mokilese, while English s usually becomes j.
In recent borrowings t and s tend to remain t (d) and s. Compare
the older borrowings sehpil ‘table’, jeila ‘sailor’ with the more
recent borrowings delpwohn ‘telephone’ and koangkiris ‘congress’. The phonology of English borrowings in Mokilese is a
complex subject yet to be studied in detail.xxviiIntroduction
The English loanwords in Mokilese are too numerous to list
exhaustively here. We will give only a brief outline of the major
types of borrowings. In the older (nineteenth-century) set, we
find a large number of words involving boats and boat-building
activities.
pohs
‘boat’
jip
‘ship’
dimper
‘rib of a boat’
soa
‘saw’
kainpis
‘canvas’
kepden
‘captain’
pwoaila
‘tank for boiling timber’
spwukseip ‘spokeshave’
wihnj
‘winch’
kihl
‘keel’
pihn
‘paint’
Many names for tools, furniture, and other implements were
also introduced during this period.
sehpil
jeia
ama
pinjel
mwoak‘table’
‘chair’
‘hammer’
‘pencil’
‘cup, glass’Many words for clothing, food, and drink are also of English
origin.
pilawa
pirehs
malahsohs
ihs
juke
piha
roam
raujij
jehs
ju‘flour, bread’
‘biscuit’
‘molasses’
‘yeast’
‘sugar’
‘beer’
‘rum’
‘trousers’
‘shirt’
‘shoe’American missionaries introduced many terms, including religious terms, names for church offices, and names of the months.xxviiiIntroduction
ehl
jehsen
elder
kohs‘Hell’
‘Satan’
‘elder in the church’
‘God’The list of such older English loanwords in Mokilese is extensive. It also includes many color terms (krihn ‘green’, dan
‘tan’), units of measure (inj ‘inch’, pihd ‘foot’, iahs ‘yard’),
games and other amusements (pilei ‘to play cards’, jeked
‘checkers’, dainj ‘dance’). A complete list would run to many
pages.
English loanwords of the recent (post–World War II) period
consist largely of terms for government and civil institutions
and new products that have been introduced during the
American administration. Among these are:
kias
sipahk
klohrahks
kirajiweid
koangkiris‘gasoline’
‘spark plug’
‘bleach’
‘graduate’
‘congress’This list is still growing as many more Mokilese learn English
and are exposed to American products and culture.
0.3.3 Borrowings from Other Micronesian Languages
Because the people of Mokil have lived in close contact with
Ponapeans, Marshallese, Pingelapese, and Kusaieans for so
many years, it seems obvious that words from the languages
spoken by these people must have entered Mokilese. Since
all these languages are closely related they tend to resemble
one another rather closely, so that it is often difficult to recognize words in Mokilese borrowed from other Micronesian languages. Some cases are clear, however. For example, words
like indan ‘popular’, pohnkahke ‘lazy’, rahnmwahu ‘greetings’,
and wahn poaroan ‘minister’ have been borrowed from Ponapean. It would appear that words like moado ‘skilled navigator’
and mej ‘exhausted’ are Marshallese in origin. It is likely that
the word doa ‘sugarcane’ was borrowed from Kusaiean. There
are undoubtedly many more Mokilese words borrowed from thexxixIntroduction
other languages of Micronesia, but it is difficult to tell exactly
how many because of the problems in distinguishing such borrowings from native Mokilese words.xxx1 The Phonology of Mokilese
Language is primarily sound; or, more precisely, sound produced by the human speech organs and arranged in a manner
that is meaningful to a listener who speaks the same language.
Is is not one of the main tasks of this grammar to describe how
speech sounds are produced; but, in order to understand the
Mokilese sound system, we will give some attention to articulatory phonetics, the study of the production of speech sounds.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]"

This first attempt toward a grammar of Mokilese is bound to be
a disappointment to all. It is intended to be a grammar that will
be useful to native speakers of Mokilese, both as a stimulus towards the development of interest in the study of the Mokilese
language, and as an introduction to the study of language in
general. The grammar’s second aim is to provide information on
Mokilese for the linguist. I have tried to steer a middle course
between these two audiences and I fear that in doing so I have
failed to satisfy either. It is my hope that the present work
will be succeeded by other efforts in both the educational and
the purely linguistic spheres. Errors of fact, of analysis, and of
design present in the following pages can then be corrected.
The research summarized here was carried out between October 1971 and December 1973 at the Pacific and Asian Linguistics Institute (PALI) of the University of Hawaii. During June
and July of 1973 I was able to work on Mokil. Of the many
people who struggled valiantly to teach me Mokilese, I must
give special thanks to Salich Albert, Aruwo David, Aira Edmond,
Galen Joel, Lidy Poll, and Damien Sohl. Thanks also to Thomas
H. Roberts for allowing me to use the Mokilese data he collected
during 1970 and 1971, and to Donald M. Topping, the then director of the PALI, who gave me invaluable help and advice at
every stage of my work. My special thanks go to the clerical
staff of the PALI for suffering through numerous revisions of
early drafts, and to the Linguistics Department of Monash University, Melbourne, for its cooperation in the preparation of the
final typescript. Lastly, I must not fail to acknowledge the contribution of my wife Nicole, who not only typed the bulk of the
final manuscript, but also proved to be an excellent linguistic
fieldworker whose suggestions, drawn from her attempts to use
the grammar as an aid in learning Mokilese, were of great value
throughout.xvAbbreviations

0.1 THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE
Language can be defined in many ways. Most people tend to
think of language as a tool; one we use to communicate our
wishes and thoughts to other people. This view equates language with talking, an external, social activity involving ourselves and other people. What we often overlook is that language is also a tool for thinking. In a real sense, we use
language to communicate internally with ourselves, to frame
ideas, make plans, and consider problems. Whenever we think,
dream, worry, or engage in any other mental activity we use
words and we make sentences, although these are words and
sentences that we alone “hear” without ever having to speak
them.
As a social instrument, language is more than a means of
communication. It is also a symbol of identity, a way of setting
off one’s own group from other groups. At the simplest level,
young people often use slang words not used by adults. The
use of these words sets off the young as a social group. On
Ponape, for example, the use of high language helps define
social groups. On an even larger scale, is it not to a great extent
the fact that one speaks Mokilese that makes one a Mokilese?
In this sense, language helps define ethnic and national groups.
The study of language is important for all these reasons.
First, because language is a tool of communication, the study of
language is to some degree the study of how we communicate,
and may aid us in learning how to communicate more effectively. Second, because language is tied closely to all thought
processes, the study of language is important in understanding
the structure of thought and perhaps ultimately the structure of
the human mind. Third, one studies his own language to learn
to what extent it shapes, and is shaped by, the society in which
he lives. Pride in one’s language and a desire to preserve it and
to understand its workings should follow directly from pride in
oneself and in one’s community.xviiIntroduction
0.1.1 Grammar
There are also a number of ways to define the word “grammar.”
It is, first, a set of rules and observations about a language and,
second, a book in which these rules and observations are set
down. In referring to language the word rule has two senses
that have led to two very different conceptions of the purpose
of a grammar. Some people take the term rule of grammar to
mean a rule about how a language should be spoken. For example, it is a rule of the grammar of English, in this sense, that
one should not use the word ain’t or that one should say “He
and I went fishing” rather than “Him and me went fishing.” This
kind of grammar has been called PRESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR because
it seeks to prescribe (direct, order) how language should be
used. (Terms printed in small capital letters are defined in Appendix B.)
The second sense of the notion rule of grammar derives from
the observation that languages do not use words and sounds
randomly, but follow set patterns. Thus, in Mokilese, the word
wa ‘the’ must always follow the word to which it refers: (woalwa
‘the man’ not *wa woal). Also, whenever the word wa follows
a word that ends in p or m, the w of wa changes to p or m.
Thus, poappa ‘the board’ (not *poapwa) and damma ‘the outrigger’ (not *damwa). (In this grammar, ungrammatical structures will be preceded by an asterisk (*).) These are rules of the
grammar of Mokilese in the sense that they describe the patterns that words and sentences must follow in Mokilese. This
kind of grammar has been called DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR because
it seeks to describe how a language actually is used by those
who speak it, rather than to set down laws concerning how a
certain individual, or group, feels the language should be used.
This grammar attempts to be descriptive of Mokilese, a set
of observations about how Mokilese is used and spoken by the
speakers of Mokilese who gave so much of their time to teach
me about their language. At no time does it claim to be a set of
rules about how Mokilese should be spoken. In this grammar,
when we speak of a grammatical sentence or a grammatical
structure in Mokilese, we are talking about something that the
Mokilese people might say in the proper circumstances. Conversely, an ungrammatical sentence or structure is one that is
not correct Mokilese, because it is not a sentence or structure
that any Mokilese himself would ever use. Thus, example 1a is a
grammatical sentence in Mokilese, while 1b is ungrammatical.
xviiiIntroduction
1a. Woal sihkeio poaloahdi sukhoahu
man strong-that chop-down tree-that
‘The strong man chopped down the tree.’
b. *Sihkei woallo poaldi suhkoahu. 2
(An English sentence such as *‘The man strong was chopped the
tree.’ captures the flavor of the Mokilese sentence 1b.)
It might be wise to caution the reader at this point that it is
often difficult to judge the grammaticality of structures in a language. Some people might allow certain structures that others
consider totally ungrammatical, while a third group might be
undecided. This is perhaps true of an English sentences such as:
2. There’s a man come to see you.
As much as possible I have tried to note places in which
speakers of Mokilese seem to disagree on the grammaticality of
structures in their language.
0.1.2 Organization
Language is a complex mechanism. To some extent it may be
compared to a multistoried building in which small units
(bricks) are put together in a certain fashion to make larger
units (rooms, stories) which, when taken together, make up a
larger unit (the whole building). In language we might consider the smallest units to be the sounds that a given language
uses. These combine together to form the larger units that we
call WORDS, which then combine according to fixed patterns to
form larger units called SENTENCES. It is also possible to consider units larger than sentences, units we might call speeches,
stories, narratives, discourses, and so forth. For the most part,
sentences are the largest units with which we will be concerned
in this grammar.
The first chapter of the grammar will be concerned with
PHONOLOGY, the study of sounds and the ways in which theycan combine. Of course, we will be dealing almost exclusively
with the phonology (sounds and sound system) of Mokilese.
Chapter 2 will deal with MORPHOLOGY, the study of the structure
of words. That subject will be taken up again, by way of summation, in chapter 11. The subject matter of the rest of thexixIntroduction
grammar will be SYNTAX, the study of the ways in which words
combine to form sentences, and, to a lesser extent, SEMANTICS,
the study of the system of meanings that are associated with
words and sentences.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]"
"Loap riaw wiahda ew.
‘Two halves make a whole.’
4.1.7 Ordinal NumbersOrdinal numbers specify the position, or order, in which an
object occurs in a series; first, second, third, and so forth. Ordinals are formed in Mokilese by prefixing ka- to the regular
numbers. Note that ‘first’ is always keiow (derived from ew
‘one’) no matter what classifier the accompanying noun requires. All other ordinals are formed regularly: kariaw,
karoahmen, karahpas, kariahkij ‘second’, kajiluw, kajilmen, kajilpas, kajilkij ‘third’, and so on.
The ordinals carry two slightly different but related meanings. The first is the position-in-an-order meaning noted in
the preceding paragraph:
6. Ngoah ne wadekla puk kajiluwwo.
‘I’ve already read the third book.’
7. I oar woal karoahmenno ma pokihdi ngoahi.
‘It was the second man who hit me.’974 Quantification
The second meaning suggests a ranking in quality (rather than
in position), and is perhaps most aptly translated by ‘best’.
8. Ih woal keiow in daka dopi.
‘He is the best man in the high jump.’
Ordinal numbers may either follow the noun to which they
refer, as in sentences 1 to 3, or they may precede them, as in:
9. Karahpas in pinjellok kajda.
‘The second pencil is cracked.’
10.Koah ioar keiow in armaj ma suhoang ngoahi nehn imwen
wini.
‘You’re the first person to visit me in the hospital.’
When the ordinal number precedes the noun, it is linked to
that noun by the particle in (called the construct particle—see
section 5.7.1). Sentence 9 (omitting details) may be diagrammed:Note that the meaning of such constructions changes slightly
depending on whether the noun is marked as singular or plural
(see section 3.3.2.1).
kajilmen in woallok (plural noun)
‘the third man’
kajilmen in woallo (singular noun)
‘the third one, counting from that man’
It appears that the ‘best’ meaning is more often associated
with the ordinal that follows the noun (particularly in the case
of keiow ‘first’) and that the rank order meaning is more often
associated with the ordinal in an in-construction. These observations do not seem to hold for all cases, however.
98Mokilese Reference Grammar
Finally, note the use of the ordinal in an in-construction in
the following sentences:
11. Keiow in oai kapangda ih, ngoah mwehuki ih.
‘The first time I saw her, I liked her.’
12. Me ioar kariaw in oai pirin lel Pohnpei.
‘This is the second time I have visited Ponape.’
In sentences 11 and 12, the ordinals of the general counting
series are used to mean ‘the first time’, and so forth. The construction oai kapangda ih ‘my seeing her’ is being used here
as a noun phrase, in exactly the same way as pinjellok ‘those
pencils’ in sentence 9:Such constructions will be discussed in section 10.6.5.
4.1.8 Indefinite Articles and the Number ‘One’
The full forms of the number ‘one’ appear after nouns only in
cases of special emphasis. For example, woal emen ‘one man
not two’. The number ‘one’ is more often represented by the numeral classifier alone, appearing as a suffix to the noun:
woalmen
woal emen‘one man’warpas
war apas‘one canoe’pukkoaw
puk ew‘one book’Note that the number ‘one’ in the general counting system is
never used without the numeral prefix. It is always either -ew or
-oaw.
As noted in 3.3.2.1, the suffixed forms of the number ‘one’
are also used as INDEFINITE DETERMINERS.
994 Quantification
woalmen
pukkoaw
pinjelpas
anjoaukij‘a man’
‘a book’
‘a pencil’
‘some time’
4.1.9 Position of NumbersNumbers usually follow the nouns to which they refer:
armaj pahmen
jiloa rahpas
wus ijuw‘four people’
‘two axes’
‘seven bananas’The indefinite determiners are suffixes that are looselybound (see 2.1.2.1) to the words to which they are attached:
kasmen
pukkoaw
pinjelpas‘a cat’
‘a book’
‘a pencil’Other numbers are independent words.
Within the noun phrase, numbers normally follow other attributes, but precede determiners:
ni koalik rahpasso
‘those two large coconut trees’
anjoau mwehukije
‘this good time’
pwohla pwuhsuhssoaw
‘a round ball’
This kind of internal noun phrase structure may be diagrammed:100Mokilese Reference Grammar
The number may precede other attributes, but in this case its
meaning is somewhat different. Compare:
a.jeri siksik roahmenno
‘those two small boys’b.jeri roahmen siksikko
‘those two small boys’The noun phrase b) appears to single out two boys from a group
who are all small. It seems, then, that moving a number from its
usual position to one closer to the noun places special emphasis
on the number.
The words ew, emen, apas ‘one’, ekij ‘a bit, a little, some’
and epwi ‘a few’ can precede a noun. When that noun has no
determiner, the words mean ‘another’ or ‘other’. For example:
13. Kihdoahng ngoahi ew puk.
‘Give me another book.’
14. Ih wahdo epwi puk sohrohr.
‘He brought some different books.’
15. Joah isar pil ipoai; ih pirin wahdo ekij pil.
‘I don’t have enough water; he’ll bring some more.’
When a determiner appears in these constructions, the
meaning is somewhat different.
16.Kihdoahng ngoahi apas pinjellen apel jiluw poaun in
koahpihen.
‘Give me one pencil and three pounds of coffee.’ (said in a
store, for example)
17.Ngoah anahne emen woallo ma kidal lalin Kusahi.
‘I need a man who speaks Kusaiean.’
18.Ekij pillen en wijekdo.
‘Some water should be brought.’1014 Quantification
In such cases the preceding numeral has the meaning ‘some’ or
‘any’. With a singular determiner the whole noun phrase refers
to any of a certain kind of object; with a plural determiner it
refers to any of a particular group of objects.

"3.3 REFERENCE: DETERMINERS AND PRONOUNS
As we have said before, most nouns refer to classes of people
or objects. A noun like li ‘woman’ identifies a group of people
having certain characteristics, and a noun like suhkoa ‘plant’, a
group of objects with a different set of characteristics. Because
the number of people or objects to which a certain noun, like li
or suhkoa, might refer is so large, it is necessary to have some
way to restrict its reference. In this way, the noun will refer to
only a small number of all the possible objects to which it might
refer, or even to one particular object. A number of different
kinds of morphemes can be used to determine the reference 3
of a noun. One such set of morphemes are called DETERMINERS.
These include such suffixes as -e ‘this’, -o ‘that’, -kai ‘these’, -pwi
‘some’ and -wa ‘the’. Determiners serve to point out the location
of the object(s) being discussed or to tell us whether the object
is one with which we should be familiar. The form and function
of determiners in Mokilese will be discussed in sections 3.3.2 to
3.3.6.
PRONOUNS (3.4), unlike determiners, do not help to determine the reference of nouns. Rather, as has already been
suggested above, they take the place of nouns whose identity
and reference should be clear to the hearer. The form and
function of Mokilese pronouns will be discussed in section 3.4.",[93]
"1115 Possessive Constructions5.2 THE POSSESSIVE SUFFIXES
An inalienably possessed noun in a possessive construction has
two parts—a noun stem, representing the thing possessed, and
a possessive suffix, representing the possessor. For each personal pronoun (see 3.4.1) there is a corresponding possessive
suffix. That is, the suffix changes depending on whether the possessor is first person (the speaker), second person (the hearer),
or third person; or singular, dual, plural, or remote plural.
In addition to the possessive suffixes that have pronominal
counterparts, there is an additional suffix, called the construct
suffix, that is used when the possessor is represented by a noun
rather than a pronoun. A noun stem with the construct suffix is
called a CONSTRUCT FORM. Compare:
a. oadoan woallo
b. oadoaioa
c. oadoa‘that man’s name’
‘my name’
‘his name’The construct form oadoan ‘name of’ is used in a) because the
possessor is represented by the noun woal ‘man’.
Below is the complete possessive PARADIGM 3 of the noun ad
‘name’.

"1135 Possessive Constructions
5.2.2 Uniform Suffix Analysis
In this analysis, the division between the root and the possessive suffix would be made so that each suffix would have as
few different forms as possible. In the case of the paradigm for
ad ‘name’, the root would be oadoa- and the suffixes would be
-ioa ‘my’, -mwen ‘your’ -ø (zero) ‘his’, and -n ‘construct’, and so
forth. In this analysis, the possessive root (e.g., oadoa-) would
differ from the free form (in this case ad) in having an extra final
vowel. 6 However, this analysis has the advantage of reducing
the number of different forms of each suffix. It would require
only three forms of the third person singular suffix—ø (zero) in
forms like oadoa ‘his name’ and moange ‘his head’ -n in forms
like kilin ‘his skin’, and -a in forms like japwah ‘his land’ (japwa
+ a=japwah).
5.2.3 Stem Formant Analysis
The third possible treatment of the possessive forms is a compromise between the previous two. In it, the root would be given
(morphophonemics aside) the same form as that of the free form
(as in the uniform root analysis) while the suffixes would be
analyzed so as to have as few different forms as possible (as
in the uniform suffix analysis). A form like oadoaioa ‘my name’
would be analyzed as oad+oa + ioa, in which oad- is the root
‘name’, -ioa is the suffix ‘my’, and -oa- is a special stem formant
vowel (see 2.1.2.4) that must be inserted between the root and
a possessive suffix.
This analysis is not without its problems, however. First, it
is not clear whether to treat a form like oadoa ‘his name’ as
oad+oa +ø, with a zero third person singular possessive suffix,
or as oad+oa, with no stem formant vowel and -oa as the third
person singular possessive suffix. Second, in most cases we
must know for each noun root which stem formant vowel to use
(for example, -oa- in the case of oad- ‘name’, but -e- in the case
of moang- ‘head’), since the identity of the stem formant vowel
is not fully predictable. In this respect, this analysis seems to
have little advantage over the uniform suffix analysis discussed
above.
The analysis we adopt here is basically the uniform suffix
analysis. (At some points, deviations from this analysis will be
suggested.) This analysis seems to correspond closely to the
history of Mokilese. At one time, most Mokilese words that now
114Mokilese Reference Grammar
end in consonants ended in vowels. We know this was the case
by comparing Mokilese with other Micronesian (and Oceanic)
languages that still have these vowels. A word like ad ‘name’
was at one time probably *ada. (The asterisk here indicates a
form that does not exist but might have at one time.) These old
final vowels are now preserved in the possessive forms. Thus
oadoaioa ‘my name’ was probably originally *ada + i (to which
the suffix -oa was later added). While the final /a/ in forms like
*ada was removed by a process called final vowel deletion, the
same vowel /a/ remained in a form like *ada + i because there it
was not final. For example:
*ada*ada+i
Final Vowel Deletion ad ———
ad *ada + i (later oadoai, then oadoaioa)
Viewed in the light of the probable history of Mokilese, it is
therefore not surprising that a free form like ad ‘name’ should
appear as oadoa- in the possessive paradigm.
The possessive suffixes are given in the following table, accompanied by a brief review of some of their more important
characteristics.

"11.7 VERBS AND NOUNS
There are many examples of Mokilese words of exactly the same
form with both verbal and nominal meanings. In many cases
most Mokilese would feel that the verbal meaning is central and312Mokilese Reference Grammar
that the nominal meaning is derived from it. In other cases the
opposite might be true, and in still others it is difficult to decide.
Some examples are:
aproa n
aproa v‘his shoulder’
‘to carry on the shoulder’inapnap n
inapnap v‘a cushion’
‘to cushion’deidei n
deidei v‘a man-made taro patch’
‘to dig’kojuk n
kojuk v‘a gun’
‘to shoot’Keeping this problem in mind, let us consider processes that
allow words to change their word class membership. In section
11.5.3, we discussed various nominalization processes, by
which a verb can be converted into a noun. In the following
section we will review several forms of the opposite process,
that is, nouns being converted into verbs.
11.7.1 Verbalization
One verbalization process has already been discussed: the creation of transitive verbs from nouns by the addition of the suffix
-i.
In other cases, nouns can be used as verbs with no change
in form. For example, nouns referring to clothing can be used as
verbs in the meaning ‘to wear…’.
26.","[343, 344]"
"272Mokilese Reference Grammar10.4 RELATIVE CLAUSES
A RELATIVE CLAUSE is a sentence used within a noun phrase as an
attribute (see 6.4.1) of a noun or pronoun. Some examples (in
which the relative clauses are emphasized) are:
69.Ngoah kangla mwingehu ma koah kihdoahng ngoahi aio.
‘I ate the food that you gave me yesterday.’
70.Jeriho ma peik pel mine ah johjo.
‘The child who is respectful will get his inheritance.’
71.Me ma kin doh kin mwomwen siksik.
‘Something that is far away seems small.’
72.Ioar joangwa ma kin mine joaroakin.
‘It was the kind that has a sail’
73.Arai uruhrki ih ma lujdihwe nehn pillo.
‘They laughed at him, the one who had dived into the
water.’
In sentence 69, the relative clause ma koah kihdoahng ngoahi
aio ‘that you gave me yesterday’ identifies the food that was
eaten. Similarly, in sentence 70, the relative clause ma peik
‘who is respectful’ describes some quality of the child being discussed. In sentence 73, the relative clause ma lujdihwe nehn
pillo ‘who had dived into the water’ further specifies the person
referred to by the pronoun ih ‘him’.
The structure of a relative clause within a noun phrase can
be seen in the following diagram:27310 Complex Sentences10.4.1 The Relative Marker ma
In Mokilese, a relative clause is the last element of the noun
phrase in which it occurs. Relative clauses are usually preceded
by the relative marker ma ‘that’‚ as in the above examples. It
appears, however, that the relative marker is always optional in
Mokilese. 7 Thus, example 74 is equivalent to example 69 above:
74. Ngoah kangla mwingehu koah kihdoahng ngoahi aio.
‘I ate the food you gave me yesterday.’
The following are examples of sentences in which the Mokilese
relative marker ma may be deleted but the corresponding
English ‘that’ or ‘who’ must remain. The optionality of ma is indicated by putting it in parentheses; thus, (ma):
75. Jeriho (ma) peik pel mine ah johjo.
‘The child who is respectful will get his inheritance.’
76. A mine armajmen (ma) kidal?
‘Is there someone who knows?’
77. Koakonno (ma) kupjang pohn sehpillo ohla akpas.
‘The box that fell off the table is broken now.’274Mokilese Reference Grammar
10.4.2 Pronouns in Relative Clauses
A complex sentence containing a relative clause may be viewed
as two coordinate (see 10.3) sentences combined in a very
special way. Example 78, loosely equivalent to example 75
above, consists of the two sentences 79a and b joined by the coordinate conjunction a ‘and, but’.
78. Jeriho peik a jeriho pel mine ah johjo.
‘That child is respectful and that child will get his
inheritance.’
79a.Jeriho peik.
‘That child is respectful.’
Jeriho pel mine ah johjo.
b.
‘That child will get his inheritance.’
Because both sentences 79a and 79b discuss the same person,
represented by the noun phrase jeriho ‘that child’, they may be
combined in a relative clause construction. That is, sentence
79a may be treated as an attribute of the noun phrase jeriho
‘that child’ in 79b, since it describes one of the child’s qualities
(in this case, the fact that he is respectful). However, if we try
to combine the two sentences as:
80 *Jeriho ma jeriho peik pel mine ah johjo.
the result is not a grammatical sentence. It is normal for a
second occurrence of a noun phrase (in this case, the noun
phrase jeriho ‘that child’ in ma jeriho peik ‘that that child is
respectful’) to be replaced by the corresponding pronoun (see
3.4). If we pronominalize the second occurrence of jeriho ‘that
child’ in 80, the result is the grammatical sentence:
80. Jeriho ma ih peik pel mine ah johjo.
‘The child who is respectful will get his inheritance.’
in which the noun phrase jeriho has been replaced by the
pronoun ih ‘he’ in the relative clause.
Consider:27510 Complex Sentences
82. Woallo ma John pokihla ih mine nehn imwen wini.
‘The man that John beat up is in the hospital.’
83. Jeripeinno ma ngoah suhoang ih aio mihn Pohnpeimen.
‘The girl that I met yesterday is a Ponapean.’
84. Ngoah jeuweje woallo ma ih kioang ngoahi mwinge.
‘I helped the man who brought me food.’
In sentence 82, the pronoun ih in the relative clause ma John
pokihla ih ‘that John beat him up’ refers to the preceding noun
phrase woallo ‘that man’. Similarly, ih in example 83 refers to
jeripeinno ‘that girl’ and ih in example 84 refers to woallo ‘that
man’.
Note also, however, that these pronouns may be freely
deleted from the relative clauses in which they occur. Thus, example 75 above is equivalent to example 81 with the pronoun ih
deleted. Similarly, examples 82–84 may be rendered:
85. Woallo ma John pokihla mine nehn imwen wini.
‘The man that John beat up is in the hospital.’
86. Jeripeinno ma ngoah suhoang aio mihn Pohnpeimen.
‘The girl I met yesterday is a Ponapean.’
87. Ngoah jeuweje woallo ma kioang ngoahi mwinge.
‘I helped the man who gave me food.’
10.4.3 Possessive Constructions in Relative Clauses
There is one case in which a pronoun within a relative clause
may not be deleted, even though it refers to the noun phrase
of which the relative clause is an attribute. These are cases in
which the element in question is the possessor in a possessive
construction within a relative clause. Consider:
88.Jemen woallo koapwoahpwoa, a noai jeripeinno painki
woallo.
‘The father of that man is rich, and my daughter married
that man.’
Since both occurrences of woallo ‘that man’ in example 88 refer
to the same person, it is possible to change

"32912 Sentence Processes
In sentences were the basic word order is VERB + OBJECT it
is perhaps correct to say that these sentences have no subject,
since the subject, as defined above, must precede the verb.
In the case of sentences where the order of basic elements is
variable (e.g. VERB + OBJECT or OBJECT + VERB), we can say that
these sentences only have subjects when the verb is not the
first major element. I would like to claim that in such cases, the
order VERB + OBJECT is the basic order and that the order OBJECT
+ VERB is the result of a rule of subject formation, which
moves noun phrases into subject (pre-verbal) position. Let us
first examine a few clear cases of the operation of this rule.
12.2.1 Subject Formation from a Nominalized Complement.
In the previous section we discussed intransitive sentences
having nominalized complements as topics. For example:
26.","[360, 361]"
"Doahkko koahdi John.
‘That dog bit John.’
Ih koahdi John.
‘It bit John.’
Joauo joah mwomwen koalik.
‘The sun doesn’t seem large.’
Ih joah mwomwen koalikjang jampah.
‘It doesn’t seem larger than the earth.’In 86b, the pronoun ih ‘it’ refers to the noun phrase doahkko
‘that dog’ of 86a; in 87b the same pronoun is used to refer to
the noun phrase joauo ‘the sun’ of 87a.
The term personal derives from the fact that these pronouns are grouped according to persons (see 3.3.2.3). That is,
we speak of pronouns as being first person if they refer to
the speaker, as second person if they refer to the hearer but
not the speaker, and as third person if they refer to neither
the speaker nor the hearer. This corresponds to the division
of demonstratives into speaker-oriented, hearer-oriented, and
third-person-oriented.",[112]
"346Appendix A
WRITTEN MOKILESEA.1 STANDARD SPELLING
Mokilese is used very little for writing. Most of the written material available to the Mokilese is either Ponapean or English,
so that there are no models to follow for writing Mokilese.
As a result, most Mokilese use either Ponapean or English for
writing. If they use Mokilese, it is usually heavily influenced by
Ponapean. It is hoped that the appearance of this Mokilese Reference Grammar and the Mokilese Dictionary will lead to more
extensive use of Mokilese as a written language.
A standard spelling system is a set of rules and conventions
for writing a language. The existence of such a system provides
a ready answer to the question, “How should I write this
word?”. For languages with a standard spelling system, one
need only consult a dictionary to find out how a given word
should be spelled. Standard spelling systems usually do not
arise overnight, however. To become established, such a system
requires that it be accepted by speakers of the language and,
most important, that it be used by them.
Mokilese lacks the written tradition that has given rise to
most standard spelling systems for the world’s languages and
consequently, lacks a standard spelling system. For this reason,
we have had to make some essentially arbitrary decisions concerning the spelling system used in this Grammar and the Mokilese Dictionary. Such decisions had to be made for the sake
of consistency. While they are based, I feel, on sound scientific
principles, they are not intended to provide a firm and final
statement of how Mokilese is to be written. This can be done
only by the Mokilese people themselves, as they use their language. What we have tried to do here is simply to provide a
starting point.","[377, 378]"
"Wahdoahng ngoahi kehs pokonno.
‘Bring me the full case.’4.3 THE LIMITING SUFFIX -OAR
When used in a noun phrase, the suffix -oar can be translated as
‘only’ or, in some instances, ‘same’. It can be suffixed directly to
a noun, number, determiner, or other noun phrase attribute.
52. Pwen rimehr 2 doari, a joh pil.
‘Only bottles, but no water.’
53. Mine oai pwo pahwwoar.
‘I have only four poles.’106Mokilese Reference Grammar
54. Me pwen koauwahr.
‘This is still the same hook.’
55. Ngoah kak kapang pako roahmennohr.
‘I can see only those two sharks.’
The determiner with which -oar is most commonly used is wa. In this case, the unit -wahr (-wa + oar) has the meaning ‘the
same’.
56.Amwda koah pel kihdoahng ngoahi joangoan
mwingehwahr?
‘Why do you always give me the same kind of food?’
The suffix -oar may also follow other noun phrase attributes
(see 6.4.1).
57. Kihdoahng ngoahi adroau koalikkoar doari.
‘Give me only big eggs.’
The word doari ‘that’s all’ frequently follows the suffix -oar
for extra emphasis, as in sentences 52 and 57. Other examples
are:
58. Ih anahne pukkoawehr doari.
‘He wants only this one book.’
59. Ngoah pirin wahdo moai riawwoar doari.
‘I’ll bring only two breadfruit.’
When used with a negative, -oar can often be translated as
‘except’. For example:
60. Joh armaj kamehlele, a armajjehr.
‘No one believed, except this person.’
61. Armaj ohroj dupuk, a Johnnoar joah.
‘Everyone paid except John.’
The suffix -oar is used in a related, but rather different way,
in verb phrases. This use will be discussed in section 10.3.3.","[137, 138]"
"0.2 MOKIL AND THE MOKILESE LANGUAGE
Mokilese is a Micronesian language spoken by the approximately four hundred inhabitants of Mokil Atoll, Ponape District,
Eastern Caroline Islands, and by perhaps another eight hundred
to one thousand people residing on the island of Ponape, principally in the town of Kolonia and in Sokehs municipality. The
history of Mokil, and therefore of its language, has been shaped
by two factors: its position with regard to winds and ocean currents, and its frequent exposure to devastating typhoons. The
modern history of Mokil begins with just such a typhoon around
1780. It ravaged the atoll to such an extent that only about
thirty people survived. (It is probable that more people died of
starvation following the typhoon than in the storm itself.) The
Mokilese people are the descendants of these survivors and of
newcomers who reached Mokil afterwards.
Mokil is so situated that freely drifting canoes, particularly
from the Marshalls, cannot help but make a landfall there. The
Mokilese have numerous stories about Marshallese visitors, settlers, or invaders, and these stories, perhaps, have led to the
belief that Mokilese is somehow linguistically closer to Marshallese than are the other languages of Ponape district. While
this may be true, I have found very little more similarity between Mokilese and Marshallese than between Mokilese and
other Micronesian languages. The resemblance of Mokilese to
Ponapean is much more striking. Moreover, it is not obvious that
any more Marshallese appear in Mokilese genealogies since the
typhoon of 1780 than do immigrants from other islands. A much
more significant influence on Mokilese was the frequent visits
by whalers in the nineteenth century. A few of these whalers
settled on Mokil and appear to have made large genetic and cultural, as well as linguistic, contributions.
The large settlements of Mokilese on Ponape began after
1905, through a combination of events: first, another typhoon
that destroyed all the atoll’s sources of food and, second, a rebellion in 1911 against the German administration on Ponape,xxIntroduction
centered in Sokehs municipality. The German authorities banished large numbers of the rebellious inhabitants of Sokehs
and resettled large numbers of Mokilese on their land. Many
of the Mokilese returned to Mokil, but large numbers stayed
on Ponape. Since the typhoon of 1905, all of Mokil’s surplus
population has been shifting to Ponape. (It is probable that the
atoll cannot economically support many more than five or six
hundred inhabitants.) This trend has increased since the end
of World War II, as interisland shipping was improved. At the
present time, many Mokilese seem to spend at least part of
every year on Ponape with relatives who live there, and many
own property on both islands. There are probably no Mokilese,
except the very young, who have not visited Ponape.
Because of this peculiar social situation, most Mokilese have
some command of Ponapean. This has already led to extensive
borrowing of Ponapean words. In future this borrowing can tend
only to increase.
0.2.1 The Position of Mokilese
It should be obvious that the more a language resembles one’s
native language (in using similar words to name the same objects or actions, in constructing sentences in similar ways, and
so forth) the easier that language will be to learn. We may think
of languages as being somewhat like members of a family. The
more closely related they are, the more likely they are to resemble one another. More distant relatives, whether languages
or people, resemble each other less. Just as people from different families often bear almost no resemblance to one another, unrelated languages will tend to use very different words,
sentence types, and so on.
The parallel between language groups and family groups
does not end here, however. Just as we can say that two people
are related through a common ancestor, it is possible to say
that two languages are related in this way. To illustrate this,
let us assume that half the people in one village on one island
move to another island a few hundred miles away. At the time
of the migration, all the people of the village, both those who
leave and those who stay, speak the same language. Languages
do not remain the same however; they are constantly changing.
Young people may not speak exactly the same way their grandparents do. They may use a few different words, or pronouncexxiIntroduction
the same words in a slightly different way. We can assume that
this would happen in the two mythical communities we have
been discussing, both in the case of those who migrated to the
new island and those who stayed behind. There is no guarantee,
however, that the same changes would occur in both places.
Over the years, perhaps many hundreds of years, change would
follow change until the languages of the two communities, originally the same, had become so different as to be called different
languages. In this way we might think of a parent language
(the language of the original community before the migration)
changing into two daughter languages. The parallel between
people and languages fails at this point, however. Parents give
birth to children, so that both parents and children can be alive
at the same time. Parent languages change into daughter languages, so that both parent and daughters cannot exist in the
same place at the same time (except where the parent language
is artificially preserved, as is true of Latin).
This process of language change is a continuous one. Two
daughter languages may themselves change, each into two
more languages, so that the original parent language has developed into four languages. These languages might be said
to belong to the same LANGUAGE FAMILY because they have a
common ancestor, namely, the language spoken in the original
community. To describe this kind of situation, we might use the
diagram in figure 1. We call such a diagram a family tree diagram. The term tree is appropriate because the original language has branched into new languages just as trees become
taller and wider by adding new branches. Each line (or branch)
in the diagram represents a series of changes that has led to the
development of a new language.","[21, 22, 23]"

Personal pronouns, except the first person inclusive, have four
numbers: singular, referring to only one person; dual, referring to two persons; plural, referring to more than two
persons; and remote plural (see below).
It is interesting to note that in a noun phrase consisting
of both a pronoun and a noun, the pronoun refers to the total
number of people involved in the event, including the person (or
people) being referred to by the noun. For example:
88.","[112, 113]"
"Rah roairoaio sipwla.
‘Its long branch is broken.’It is common, however, to repeat the inalienable noun in its
free form before adding attributes, especially if the inalienable
noun is in the construct form.
22. Mijoa maj riawwo widahli ngoahi.
‘His two eyes looked at me.’
23. Imwen woallo umwpwi mine nehn Kolonia.
‘That man’s houses are in Kolonia.’132Mokilese Reference Grammar
24. Poahn woallo poa roairoai rahpasso koldi ngoahi.
‘That man’s two long arms grabbed me.’5.7 NOUN PHRASES OF CHARACTERIZATION
At the beginning of this chapter, we defined three kinds of possessive relation: ownership, part-whole, and kinship. In the
following noun phrases we see constructions that are formally
identical with the kinds of possessive constructions we have
been discussing so far but which do not seem to represent any
of the three relations just mentioned. For example:
doahkin keikei ‘biting dog’
woalin nim piha ‘bear drinking man’
doakoahn mahn ‘deserted island’ (literally—island of
animals)
puken wadwad ‘reading book’
anjoaun jikeng ‘test time’
mahnin
‘wildlife of Mokil’
Mwoakilloa
jidohsahn Japahn‘Japanese car’
Noun phrases such as these can be called noun phrases
of characterization. They express such relations as purpose
(puken wadwad ‘book for reading’), content (kokonin juke ‘box
of sugar’), origin or location, (jidohsahn Japahn ‘Japanese car’,
mahnin Mwoakilloa ‘wildlife of Mokil’), and behavior or characteristics (doahkin keikei ‘biting dog’, woalin nim piha, ‘beer
drinking man’).
Noun phrases of characterization consist of a noun in the
construct form followed by either another noun:
winihn kihdo
doadoahkin li
oarloapin pukko
johnpadahkin
poadpoad
wanihmwin umwwo‘medicine for
ringworm’
‘woman’s work’
‘topic of the book’
‘history teacher’
‘the door of the
house’or an intransitive verb (see Section 6.5):
1335 Possessive Constructions
sohpin kamwakel
doahkin jilajil
waren joaroak
pinjelin insing
anjoaun alu‘cleaning soap’
‘guard dog’
‘sailing canoe’
‘writing pencil’
‘time to go’5.7.1 Construct Suffix in Noun Phrases of Characterization
As pointed out in section 5.3.3.1, the i-stem class is the productive class of inalienable nouns. It is not surprising, therefore,
that most nouns that are not inalienably possessed (do not have
a possessive paradigm) but do have a construct form take the
construct form -in, since this is the productive (see section 11.3)
form of the suffix. In such cases the -in construct is often treated
as a separate word, rather than as a suffix. For example:
woalin nim piha
or
woal in nim piha‘beer-drinking man’
‘beer-drinking man’When the noun to which -in is suffixed ends in a vowel or glide,
this contrast is clear. For example:
anjoaun jikeng
or
anjoau in jikeng
wijahn doadoahk
or
wija in doadoahk‘test time’
‘test time’
‘place for working’
‘place for working’In the case of nouns ending in a glide, the suffixed construct is
-n, rather than -in. The same is true of nouns ending in a vowel,
except that the vowel is lengthened before suffixing -n. In either
case, it appears that the construct marker can also appear as
the independent word in. When the construct marker appears
as an independent word, it is called the construct particle. It
is possible, in cases such as these, that the suffixed construct
particle contracts before the preceding noun, similar to English
contractions such as ‘it’s’ (from ‘it is’).
In addition to in, there appears to be a second construct particle en. Like in, it can be used both as an independent word and
as suffix. For example:134Mokilese Reference Grammar
puken wadwad‘reading book’
orpuk en wadwad
war en joaroak‘reading book’
‘sailing canoe’
orwar en joaroak‘sailing canoe’The en construct is typically used to indicate the use to which an
object is put. The two examples above might be translated ‘book
for reading’ and ‘canoe for sailing’. This construct is perhaps
related to the benefactive function of possessive classifiers that
was discussed in 5.4.2. This relation is more obvious when the
‘possessor’ in a construction with en is a noun than it is in the
two cases above, in which en was followed by intransitive verbs.
rais en Mwoakilloa
raujij en Japahnor en Mwoakilloa rais
or en Japahn raujij‘rice for Mokil’
‘pants for Japan’Note, however, that not all constructions indicating the use
of an object require en. For example, imwen kuk ‘cook house’,
but umwin suhkoa ‘house for keeping wood’. I have no explanation for these forms. The use of en in constructs of use is a
tendency, not a rule; -in may be used instead under as yet undetermined conditions.
Just as en might be related to a possessive classifier, it is
possible that in is related to the locative particle in (see 8.4).
Consider:
a. pwilin moaio
‘The sap of the breadfruit tree’
b. pwillo in moaio
‘The sap in the breadfruit tree’
The in of b) is the locative in. Note that the noun preceding the
locative in can take a determiner. Now consider the ungrammaticality of

"2.1.5.8 INTENSIVE REDUPLICATION
A few stative verbs have a special intensive form created by
lengthening and raising the pitch of the first vowel (if the form
is reduplicated) or reduplicating the first # CV(h)C(V) and lengthening and raising the pitch of the vowel nearest the root. For
example:

2.2 STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF LANGUAGELanguage may be thought of as a kind of machine. Language
has a job to perform, the very complex job of expressing
thoughts and ideas in a way that permits people to communicate with each other. A language, like a machine, has an
internal structure—a number of parts (like phonemes, morphemes, words, etc.) that are put together in fixed ways to
enable it to work efficiently. Each unit of language, and each
kind of combination into which these units can enter, contributes something to the task of expressing ideas.
It is necessary to think about language in two ways at the
same time. We must seek to describe the structures that are
found in language, to show how units such as morphemes combine to form words and how words combine with other words to
form larger units and constructions. In short, part of our job is
to describe how language, like any fine machine, is put together.
It is equally important to consider the way in which each morpheme and each construction contributes to the primary job of
language—communication.
2.2.1 The Sentence
First, we will consider whether there is anything in language
that can be called the unit of communication. It is easy to
show that this unit is not the same as the unit of meaning—the
MORPHEME that was discussed in section 2.1. Using morphemes
(or even words) in isolation is not equivalent to communicating.
Communication involves thoughts and ideas that are much more
complex than elementary units of meaning.
For example, consider a relatively simple situation that we
might want to describe through language. Let us suppose we
are on the beach, and we see an old man out on the reef fishing.
To describe what we see, we must use a number of units of
meaning (morphemes) such as the following: woal ‘man’, loakjid532 Words and Meaningful Units
‘to fish’, wos ‘reef’‚ -o ‘that’, lap ‘old’, and pohn ‘on’. It is not
enough to list the morphemes in some random order, however.
Communication requires some organization of the meaningful
units. For example, it is the man who is old, so that the morphemes woal ‘man’ and lap ‘old’ must be closely associated. One
means of expressing such association of meaning is to place the
morphemes in question near one another; thus, woal lap.
Similarly, it is the old man that we are pointing at on the
reef. We signal this kind of pointing by the morpheme -o ‘that’.
Grouping these three morphemes together we produce the construction 4 woal lappo ‘that old man’. The order of morphemes
within a construction is normally fixed. We cannot say *lappo
woal or *o woal lap. The orders lap woallo and woallo lap might
be possible, but with a different meaning (‘That man is old’
rather than ‘that old man’).
We can form another construction from pohn ‘on’, wos ‘reef’
and -o ‘that’ since these three morphemes together tell where
the old man was fishing—not under the reef, nor inside it, but
on the reef. The order of these elements is also fixed. We must
say pohn wos so, not *wosso pohn.
From the six morphemes with which we began, we now have
three units: the constructions woal lappo and pohn wosso and
the word loakjid. These, too, must be combined in a specific
way; we must say woal lappo loakjid pohn wosso ‘that old man is
fishing on the reef’ rather than *woal lappo pohn wosso loakjid.
We have described in some detail one way in which the
process of organizing morphemes into a unit that can be used
to communicate information can be viewed. What we produced
was the sentence: Woal lappo loakjid pohn wosso. ‘That old man
is fishing on the reef.’ We may, therefore, consider the SENTENCE
to be the unit of communication that we set out to define. Since
the principal function of language is communication, it must be
able to produce such units of communication. A language may
then be viewed as a device that produces sentences.
The internal structure that we assumed for the sentence
constructed in the preceding paragraphs may be diagrammed
as follows:54Mokilese Reference GrammarThis type of diagram is called a tree diagram. It is made up
of lines (called branches) that join together those morphemes
that are most closely associated in a group of morphemes. The
point in a tree diagram at which these lines meet (labeled X in
the tree above) marks a construction of associated morphemes.
These constructions can themselves be joined together in a
larger construction (and these into still larger constructions and
so forth) by means of other branches. In the above tree diagram the topmost X marks the construction that we have been
calling a SENTENCE. Thus, the above tree tells us that the sentence Woal lappo loakjid pohn wosso is a combination of the
units (constructions) woal lappo, loakjid, and pohn wosso.
2.2.2 Word Classes
One of the most important tasks of a grammar is to describe
how words combine. We have demonstrated that words or morphemes can combine to form constructions and that constructions can combine to form sentences. In most cases these elements must combine in a fixed order. For example, in a construction formed from the morphemes woal ‘man’, -o ‘that’ and
lap ‘old’, the morpheme lap must follow woal and the morpheme
-o must follow lap.
Let us now consider the sentence:
20. Jerimweinno soahrla ah raujij kapwwo
boy-that
tore
his pants new-that
‘That boy tore his new pants.’
We might proceed in the manner outlined above and produce a
tree to describe the internal structure of sentence 20.","[83, 84, 85, 86]"
"Ngoah rapahkihda ih aio.
‘I found him yesterday.’In this example, English uses an entirely different verb, ‘to
find’, in order to express an idea that is shown in Mokilese
merely by adding a suffix. In other cases English expresses a
similar idea by means of adverbs like ‘up’.
5a.",[261]
"Ngoah lujda pohn kello. 5
‘I jumped onto the fence.’In many cases, either locative or non-locative noun phrases
can be used in similar sentences. The latter would suggest a
physical object and the former a location. For example:
76a. Ngoah koddoang in diddo.
‘I bumped into the wall.’
b. Ngoah koddoang diddo.
‘I bumped the wall.’
77a. Suhkoahu koappoang in kello.
‘That tree is growing towards the fence.’
b. Suhkoahu koappoang kello.
‘That tree is growing around the fence.’
78a. Ngoah koaroannoang in wanihmwwo jang koawoa.
‘I am nearer to the door than you are.’
b. Ngoah koaroannoang wanihmwwo jang koawoa.
‘I am nearer the door than you are.’218Mokilese Reference Grammar
A large number of nouns occur most frequently in their
locative form. With such nouns, it is rare to refer to the object
in question as a physical object. Examples are:
79. Moadoak nehn kapehdihoa.
‘I have a stomachache.’
80. Ngoah aluhla pohn maddo.
‘I walked to the reef.’
81. Inenin soamwoan sakoal pohn madau rehnnoawe.
‘The ocean is very rough today.’
In many cases I have been unable to isolate the simple form of
the noun. One such example is nehnwoal ‘forest’, where there
does not appear to be a corresponding noun *woal meaning
‘forest’.","[249, 250]"
"Ih kamwingehla arai.
‘She fed them.’In 85b, the pronoun ih ‘she’ replaces the noun phrase liho ‘that
woman’; in 85c, the pronoun arai ‘them’ replaces the noun
phrase nah jerihok ‘her children’. Other examples of pronouns
as substitutes for nouns and noun phrases have already been
given in 3.2.

With verbs of emotion like mijik ‘to fear’ or peren ‘to be
happy’, either in or -ki may be used before the complement verb
when the subject of the verb of emotion is expressed. The difference between the use of in or -ki in such cases is unclear to me.

mental state or verbal activity, the complement is introduced by

koawoa.

11.1 WORDS AND MORPHEMES
In chapter 2 we stressed that words are not the smallest units
that can have meaning, and that even words can have parts.
A word such as kemwehui ‘to improve’ has three parts—the
causative prefix ke-, the root mwehu ‘good’ and the transitive
suffix -i. One of these parts, mwehu ‘good’‚ is itself an independent word that can appear alone. The other two are affixes,
which must always be attached to some root. To all such meaningful units, whether they are independent words or affixes, we
give the term MORPHEME. Thus, ke-, mwehu, and -i are all morphemes.
The study of word formation involves two closely related
topics: the study of how morphemes combine to make words;
that is, the internal structure of words; and the study of how
words can change to make new words; that is, the relationships between words.
As described in chapter 2, there are two basic components
of a word—the ROOT (the heart of the word) and AFFIXES, which
modify the meaning of the root. A word can consist of a root
alone, with no affixes, as in the case of the word mwehu ‘good’‚
or of a root with a number of affixes, as in the case of a word
like kemwehuiekla ‘to become improved’, which consists of the
root mwehu ‘good’ and the affixes ke- ‘causative’, -i ‘transitive’,
-ek ‘intransitive’, and -la ‘perfective’.
Affixes can be divided into a number of different types, outlined in chapter 2. For our purposes here we may consider three
affix types—PREFIXES like ke-, that precede the root; SUFFIXES
like -i, that follow the root, and REDUPLICATION, as in poadpoadok
‘to be planting’ (from poadoak ‘to plant’) or pikapik ‘sandy’
(from pik ‘sand’), that repeats part of the root.
We cannot study the relationships between words without
also studying the internal structure of words, because the
changes that words undergo in making new words usually involve some kind of affixation. From the word sohrohr ‘different’
we can derive the word aksohrohr ‘to show independence’ by298Mokilese Reference Grammar
means of the prefix ak, and from this word we can derive liaksohrohr ‘uncooperative’ by means of the prefix li-. However, all
relationships between words do not involve affixation. For example, a word like kodkod ‘to husk’, which is normally a verb,
can be used as a noun in a sentence such as example 1, with no
change in form: 1
1. Ah kodkoddo inenin pispis.
‘That husking of his was done very fast.’11.2 FUNCTIONS OF WORD-BUILDING
PROCESSES
The study of word formation is the study of complex or altered
words. These words are complex either because they consist of
more than one morpheme or because they are being used in unusual, untypical ways (as in the case of kodkod ‘to husk’ above).
Many of the processes we will be discussing here have already
been treated in detail in other sections of the grammar; for example, the formation of transitive and intransitive verbs. These
processes will be referred to here only as examples of word
building processes, without repeating those details of their
syntax and semantics that have been treated elsewhere.
Complex words might be created for a number of different
reasons:
a.to express obligatory categories. For example:
i) kinship terms must be possessed
joamoai
pahioa
riasa‘my father’
‘his wife’
‘our brother’ii)numbers used with nouns must contain a classifier
roahmen
jilpas
pahw‘two animates’
‘three long objects’
‘four ordinary things’b.to change the meaning of the root. For example:29911 Word Formation
the prefix ja- creates a new word with a meaning nearly
opposite that of the root
sihkei
jasihkei‘strong’
‘weak’c.to signal grammatical functions, for example, transitive and
intransitive verb suffixes
d.to signal semantic functions, for example, the suffix -ki
marking the following noun phrase as an instrument
e.to change the word class of a root, for example, to permit a
verb to function as a noun11.3 PRODUCTIVITY OF WORD-BUILDING
PROCESSES
A productive word-building process is one that can be use
freely to derive new words. This is not to say that any word in
Mokilese can be made to undergo such processes. Only words
belonging to the class to which that process applies can normally be made to undergo it. An example is the causative prefix
ka-, which is added to stative verbs (occasionally, but rarely,
to active intransitive verbs) to allow the cause of that state to
be expressed. Causativization (as we might call the causative
verb-building process) is productive in Mokilese because it can
apply to any stative verb.
A nonproductive word-building process is one that is restricted to only a few items of the class of words to which it applies. An example is the negative prefix ja-, which also affects
stative verbs. Unlike the causative ka-, the negative ja- cannot
be added to all statives. We can say kalelpoak ‘to make sure’
(from lelpoak ‘dependable’) and jalelpoak ‘undependable’, and
kamijik ‘frightening’ (from mijik ‘to be afraid’) but not *jamijik.","[327, 328, 329, 330, 331]"
"148Mokilese Reference Grammar
6.4.2 Adjectives and Verbs
In many languages active verbs can be distinguished from
stative verbs by giving the latter the label adjective and restricting the label verb to the former (with some exceptions—statives like ‘to exist’ and ‘to know’ would be considered
verbs in English, for example). The adjective-verb distinction
does not seem particularly important in Mokilese, for the following reasons:
(i) Languages with an adjective class usually require that an
adjective used predicatively be accompanied by a copula verb
like English ‘to be’. Mokilese stative verbs require no copula
when used predicatively. Compare:
48a.","[179, 180]"
"Ia dirinnoar nihmw puk?
‘How many books do you have?’In this sense, ia is used with expressions indicating extent,
such as woahr ‘same size as’, woaroain ‘extent of’, uhen
‘amount of’, dirin ‘number of, amount of’, and in expressions
containing the limiting suffix -oar ‘up to’.
The third use of ia is in questions about the identity or characteristics of a definite noun. In this case it can be translated
into English as ‘which?’

with no others. For example:

Mokilese has another set of numbers ‘one’ to ‘nine’, which are
not used to count any nouns. At one time they were probably a
neutral counting set, used when no specific objects were being
counted, or in counting a number of objects taking different
classifiers. They have been largely replaced in these functions
by the numbers of the general classifier set. These forms are:

six
seven
eight

awal
aducompareeriajilupahlimoawonoijuwaluduoa-These serial counting numbers seem to be compounds of the
prefix for ‘one’, in the forms oa-, a-, e-, and o-, and the other numeral prefixes. Thus, ari ‘two’ is a compound of a- ‘one’ and -ria
‘two’ (without the final vowel).
Note that the base -oad (similar to the unit base -ed) is used
in the serial counting number ‘one’, and that -poang ‘four’ is
used instead of -pah. Also, note that o + won ‘six’ becomes ohn.
In most cases, the bases used in this series are the prefixes of

column a) given in the list of numeral prefixes in section 4.1.1,
without the final vowels. These prefixes have been repeated
here for comparison.
The serial counting numbers combine with the morpheme

of the week:
nioahd
niari
niejil
nioapoang
nialim‘Monday’
‘Tuesday’
‘Wednesday’
‘Thursday’
‘Friday’Saturday and Sunday have different names; rehn koaunop and
rehn joarwi, respectively.
4.1.6 Fractions
Fractions are formed with the classifier kij.
jilkij pahw
‘three quarters’
riahkij limoaw ‘two fifths’, literally ‘two parts five’
The classifier used with the second number (the denominator
of the fraction) is determined by the noun to which the fraction
refers.
jilkij pahmen in jerimweinnok
‘three quarters of the boys’
limkij wonpas in suhkoahk
‘five sixths of the trees’
jilkij pahw in japwwe
‘three quarters of this land’
(Japw ‘land’ is usually counted with kij, but in the case of a
fraction it is counted with the general classifier. While normally
it is ‘pieces’ of land that are counted (thus the classifier kij),
in the case of fractions, the fraction itself seems to represent
pieces of a larger whole.","[125, 126, 127]"
"Verb phrases with transitive verbs usually contain a noun
phrase object of the verb, as in:258Mokilese Reference Grammar

‘fished’ and the object noun phrase mwumwwok ‘those fish’; in

phrase rohppo ‘that mat’.
In addition to subject and object it is possible to include
other noun phrases (expressing instrument or goal, for example) in a simple sentence. In most cases such noun phrases
are predicate attributes rather than parts of the verb phrase.
Thus:

"11.4 INFLECTION AND DERIVATION
Word formation processes are commonly divided into two types
—inflectional processes and derivational processes. These
terms are intended to capture the distinction that most of us
300Mokilese Reference Grammar
feel between what are different forms of the same word and
what are essentially different, but related, words. Processes
that create different forms of the same word are termed INFLECTION; those that create different words are termed DERIVATION.
It is not always clear which processes are to be considered
derivational and which inflectional. Some criteria have been
proposed to separate the two, but none are foolproof. We must
still depend on the judgment of speakers of the language as
to how to treat a given process. Unfortunately, as so often
happens, in many cases the judgment of the native speaker is
not clear. It has been proposed that derivational processes are:
a.those that change word class membership. Yet, for
example, the suffix ja- added to a stative verb creates what
most of us would consider to be a different word without
changing the word class: mum ‘tasty’, jamum ‘not tasty’.b.those that are not productive. Yet, most people would
consider the rather productive process of adding -ki ‘with’
to a noun to create a verb meaning ‘to use as …’ to be
derivational; for example ama ‘hammer’, amahki ‘to use as
a hammer’.","[331, 332]"
"112Mokilese Reference Grammar
Many nouns, particularly those that can only be possessed
by non-humans (that is, animals or inanimate objects), appear to
have only partial paradigms. In most of these cases only forms
for the third person singular and the construct are in common
use. For example:soa

damenIf an imaginative person could conceive of birds or trees talking,
then forms like pajihoa ‘my nest’ or soahioa ‘my leaf’ might be
possible. Since such situations are rare, the forms themselves
are rare also.
In our discussion of roots and affixes in section 2.1.1, we
mentioned that in a word consisting of more than one morpheme it is often difficult to decide where to make the division
between root and affix. As was pointed out, this is particularly
true in the case of the possessive paradigms. In that section we
suggested three possible analyses of the possessive forms. Let
us review them again here.
5.2.1 Uniform Root Analysis
In this analysis, the division between the root and the possessive suffix would be made so that the root resembles the

In the case of the paradigm for ad ‘name’, the root would be
oad- ‘name’ 5 and the suffixes would be -oaioa ‘my’, -oamwen
‘your’, -oa ‘his’, -oan ‘construct’, and so forth. The major disadvantage of this analysis is that each possessive suffix would
have to have a number of different forms. For example, the third
person singular suffix would have to have at least four forms; oa in forms like oadoa ‘his name’ (from ad ‘name’), -e in forms
like moange ‘his head’ (from moang ‘head’), -ah in forms like
japwah ‘his land’ (from japw ‘land’), and -in in forms like kilin

meaning of the in construct is often related to location, it is not
clear that it is the same morpheme as the locative particle in.
1355 Possessive Constructions
Even if the construct particles in and en began as (and to
some extent still have the properties of) independent words,
they are largely treated as construct suffixes. This is particularly true if the noun with which they are used has or might
have a construct that is similar in form. For example, the noun
umw ‘house’ has two constructs, imwen and umwin. The former
is either the construct of the possessive classifier, as in:
imwen woallo‘that man’s house’or a construct of use, as in:
imwen kuk‘house for cooking’Because umw already had an -en construct (imwen) no form
*umwen was created. The location/origin construct in -in is
formed from the root umw (rather than the regular stem imwof the possessive paradigm), because there was no -in construct
for umw in the possessive paradigm itself. Similarly, the use and
location/origin constructs of ‘canoe’ are war en and war in, respectively, formed from the root war. These contrast with the
construct of the possessive classifier, woaroan ‘vehicle of’. It is
not at all clear whether the noun war ‘canoe’ (with its two constructs war en and war in) is to be considered to be the same
word as the possessive classifier for vehicles, with its own construct woaroan. What is clear from cases like imwen ‘house of,
house for’ and umwin ‘house in’ is that constructs of use in -en
and location/origin constructs in -in can often be identified with
existing constructs that have the same form (as in the case of
the possessive classifier construct imwen ‘house of’).
Finally, note that some nouns have competing constructs
that have no obvious difference in meaning. For example: pil
‘water’, piloa ‘its water’, pilen ‘water of’, and pil ‘water’, pilin
‘its water’, pilin ‘water of’. This variation can be treated as a
case of competing paradigms, as noted earlier.","[166, 167]"
"Nehn umwwo pwirejparla.
‘That house is dusty.’In sentence 68, ‘old’ refers to the entire house, while in 69
pwirejparla ‘dusty’ does not imply that the house is made of dust
or that dust is clinging to the inside and outside walls, the roof,
and the floor, but merely that the interior of the house is dusty.
In both English and Mokilese this is the sense of sentence 69,
but in Mokilese it is expressed literally through the use of the
relational noun nehn ‘inside of’. That is, Mokilese distinguishes
between the use of a noun to name an object (as in 68) and its2178 Directionals and Locative—Possessive Sentences
use to name a location (as in 69). In the latter case, the noun
must be made locative by the use of in or of a relational noun.

coordination of noun phrase subjects. It may be diagrammed:The noun phrase subject of 9c has two parts, NP2 and NP3,
both of which are noun phrases. The parts of a coordinate construction like NP1 are said to be conjoined, and the morpheme
that joins them (in this case apel ‘and, in addition’) is called a
coordinate conjunction.

conjoined.

wants two things—half the group to bring bananas and half the
group to bring breadfruit. The fact that the second half is to
bring breadfruit can be viewed as completely independent of
the actions of the first group, so that the conjuction a is used.","[291, 292]"
"342 Words and Meaningful Units
2.1 MORPHEMES
It is common to think of words as the basic units of language.
Words are the units that we string together to form sentences.
We tend to forget that words themselves are often complex, and
that each of their parts supplies a bit of the meaning of the
whole word. For example, we can divide a word like boys into
two parts: boy and s. The first part carries the meaning ‘young
male human’ and the second the meaning ‘more than one’.
The units boy and s can be used independently of one another. Thus, s can be combined with many other units; for example, cat, boat, tree to form cats, boats, trees. Boy can be
combined with some other units too; for example, boyish ‘acting
like a boy’. It can also be used alone in a sentence like: The boy
is playing outside.
Both boy and s are independent units, but, when they are
combined they form what we commonly think of as the single
word boys. From this we must conclude that there are meaningful units in language that are smaller than words. We call
these units MORPHEMES. Some morphemes can be used alone as
words, like our example boy. Others, like the s plural marker
and the -ish in boyish, cannot appear alone. A morpheme that
can appear alone is called a FREE MORPHEME; one that cannot is
called a BOUND MORPHEME.
To illustrate from Mokilese, consider the word kamwinge ‘to
feed’. This word can be divided into two morphemes: ka ‘causative marker’ and mwinge ‘to eat’. Like the s plural marker in
English, ka in Mokilese can combine with many other elements:
du
inen
kun‘to sink’
‘straight’
‘extinguished’kadu
kainene
kakun‘cause to sink’
‘to straighten’
‘to put out’Not every occurrence of ka is a morpheme, however. For example, if we take the word kalai ‘bamboo section’ and try to
divide it into two parts: ka and lai, we find that in this case
neither of the parts has any meaning by itself. The ka in kalai is
352 Words and Meaningful Units
not the morpheme meaning ‘cause to’ and the sequence lai has
no meaning at all. The word kalai is a single morpheme, because
it cannot be broken down into smaller units that have meanings
by themselves.
2.1.1 Roots and Affixes
Morphemes can be divided into two types: ROOTS and AFFIXES.
The root may be thought of as the heart of the word. Most (but
not all) roots are free morphemes. In the case of kamwinge,
mwinge is a word that can be used alone, while ka is not.
1a. Inahu kamwinge jeriho
‘His mother fed the boy.’
b. Jeriho mwinge
‘The boy ate.’
but not
c. * Jeriho ka
Similarly, the word poki ‘to hit’ is composed of two morphemes:
pok ‘to hit’ and -i ‘transitive marker’, where pok is the root and
-i is an affix.
2a. Woallo poki jeriho
‘That man hit the boy.’
b. Ih pok jeri
‘He beats children.’
but not
c. *Woallo i jeri or anything similar.
Perhaps the true difference between root and affix is one
of meaning. The meaning of the root is the primary meaning
of the whole word. In the case of a word like jeriho ‘that boy’,
the meaning of -o ‘that’ is added to the meaning of the root
jeri ‘child, boy’. The addition of -o answers the question ‘Which
boy?’. It is very difficult to think of jeri as answering the
question ‘Which “that”?’. Similarly, in the case of kamwinge, the36Mokilese Reference Grammar
addition of ka changes the meaning mwinge ‘eat’ into ‘cause to
eat, feed’. It would be very strange to say that the addition of
mwinge changes the meaning of ka- into ‘cause to eat’. In short,
affixes can be thought of as adding meaning to the roots with
which they occur.
So far we have seen words that consist of roots alone, such
as mwinge, pok, jeri. We have also seen words that consist of
roots and affixes, such as kamwinge, poki, jeriho. It is also possible for two or more roots to combine to form compound words:
ngil ‘voice’ and mwehu ‘good’ can combine to form ngilmwehu
‘have a good voice’. Similarly, alu ‘walk’ and suhkoa ‘stick, tree’
can combine to form alusuhkoa ‘stilts’. Word-building processes
will be considered in detail in chapter 11.","[65, 66, 67, 68]"
"Woalwa ma mijoa akpas me pirin wihn.
‘The man who is in front now will win.’
72Mokilese Reference Grammar
If the speaker uses 49a, he is probably pointing to the man in
question; if he uses 49b, he has no reason to point because he is
identifying the man who will win as the one who is ahead now.
He assumes that the hearer knows who that is. The determiner
-o suggests that the object being discussed is being identified
by pointing or that it was mentioned earlier, while -wa suggests
that the identification is much more obvious, as in 49b, where
that identification appears in the sentence itself.
To summarize, DEFINITE DETERMINERS serve to identify the
nouns with which they occur. This identification might be made
by pointing, by referring to a previous mention of the noun, or
by supplying an identification of the noun in (or near) the sentence in which the noun is used. This latter function is usually
filled by -wa, as in sentence 49b. On occasion, the identification
can be supplied in a previous sentence, as in 45 above. In such
cases the function of -wa is referential. It is even possible for
-wa to be used with nouns whose identification was made at a
much earlier point in a conversation or story, as long as there is
no doubt in the mind of the hearer as to which object the noun
is referring.","[103, 104]"
"Ngoah jeidahla Kahlap.
‘I paddled to Kahlap.’
8.2.2 -do, -la, AND -weThe suffixes -do, -la, and -we mark direction towards the
speaker, away from the speaker, and towards the hearer, respectively. The changes in meaning they produce can be illustrated
by examples like the following:
3a. Ngoah pirin japahldo lakapw.
‘I’ll come back tomorrow.’
b. Ngoah pirin jopahlla lakapw.
‘I’ll go back tomorrow.’
4a. John wahdo likkoauo.

‘His house is on this side of the big rock.’
b. Imwahu mine kajapwlakoan sakai koalikko.
‘His house is on the far side of the big rock.’
For the most part the suffix -we is used like -do and -la, but
expressing motion towards the hearer.

‘I’m going to come (to where you are) later.’208Mokilese Reference Grammar
7.Ioar kahrehda koski oai insingwe, pwa ngoah kapwehse
rapahkihda nihmw adreswa rehnnoawe.
‘The reason my writing (to you) was delayed was that I just
found your address today.’
8.Pwurwe!
‘Turn around!’
In some cases, however, -we suggests direction towards a location that is known to both the speaker and hearer but is not
necessarily the location of either. This is particularly true in narrative style, as in the following sentences taken from a popular
demon story.
9. Eniho kanah okidekdahwehr ara kanah kipdihoar pakid
nehn moange.
‘The demon then lay back there and they just started pulling
the lice from his head.’
10.Ara weirda inenin dir mwinge, doari ara ken idandihwe.
‘They gathered a large amount of food, then they carried it
back down.’
In this sense, -we can often be rendered by the English word
‘back’, which also seems to mark motion towards a location previously established in the story.
As was pointed out earlier, it is common for a suffix from the
up-down set (-di, -da) to be used together with a suffix from the
participant-relation set (-do, -la, -we). In this case, the former
must precede the latter.

Descriptive and result nominalization involves the creation
of an inalienably-possessed noun from the intransitive form of
the verb by adding consonant-stem personal suffixes.
304Mokilese Reference Grammar
It is sometimes very difficult to separate the descriptive and
result functions of this nominalization type. In sentence 6, for
example, the nominalization lallalin oawoa ‘the speaking of his
mouth’ might refer to what he says or to the way he says it. Similarly, pokpokin jeriho in example 7 might be translated ‘the way
that child was beaten’ or, simply, ‘the beating of that child’. In
example 10, poadin suhkoahu seems to refer only to the result
of the activity ‘planting’; that is, to the planted tree. But in example 11, we see kurujekin mwehnggo referring to either ‘the
grounds’, the physical result of the activity of grinding, or to the
way in which the grinding was done.
The intransitive root used in forming these nominalizations
is usually reduplicated, when used to describe an event, unless
the intransitive is formed by suffixing -ek or the intransitive root
has two syllables.
Noneventive nominals are not normally reduplicated. Thus,
corresponding to the essentially eventive nominal lallalin ‘the
way he talks’ we find the noneventive lalin ‘language of’.
Similarly, corresponding to the eventive kodkodin ‘husking of’
we find the noneventive kodin ‘husking stick for…. Some verbs
seem to have only noneventive nominals; for example, poadin
‘planting of’. Nominalizations of stative verbs are normally noneventive and, therefore, unreduplicated; for example, dak in
‘brightness of’. The distinction between nominals that describe
events (eventive nominals) and those that describe objects, results, or conditions (noneventive nominals) seems to be an important one but is as yet poorly understood.
The possessor noun phrase in a descriptive or result
nominalization usually represents the person or object towards
which the activity is directed. However, particularly in the case
of active intransitive verbs, it may also refer to the agent. For
example:
12. Rahrahuin liho kadiroapwoa ngoahi.
could be translated either:
13a. ‘The way that woman screamed bothered me.’ or
b. ‘The screaming about that woman bothered me.’30511 Word Formation
An agentive interpretation of such nominalizations formed from
transitive verbs is allowed by some speakers, but others insist
that such an interpretation is impossible. These latter speakers
will not accept a sentence like:
14. ?Kodkodin woallo kapwuriamwei.
‘The way that man is husking is surprising.’11.5.3.3 DESCRIPTIVE NOMINALS OF PERFECTIVE
VERBS
Descriptive nominals are regularly formed from intransitive perfective verbs by adding the suffixes -koa ‘third person singular’
or -koan ‘construct’. For example:
15. Dakdakoan joauo inenin ling.
‘The sunrise is very pretty.’
16. Ioar doahr koajoandikoan ah lallal.

‘was looking for’ in 3b, but more often is not. 1
Here, then we have an example of Mokilese neutralizing
(collapsing, not expressing in a distinct way) a distinction that
seems to be always made in English—that between present
and past tense—and of English neutralizing a distinction that
is always made in Mokilese—that between ongoing events and
events in which ongoingness is not important.
Mokilese also demands that we express how far an event has
gone towards the attainment of its final goal. In the case of the
verb rapahki ‘to look for’, the final goal is obviously to find the
object one is looking for. If that goal has been reached, we must
mark that fact in the verb.

"353Appendix AA.6 EXCRESCENT AND REDUCED VOWELS
An excrescent vowel is a vowel that is inserted in rapid speech
between two consonants to make the sequence easier to pronounce. Such vowels appear between the non-italic consonants
in words like:
pwungla
pakrikrik‘to become correct’
‘to coax’Excrescent vowels are never written.
A reduced vowel is a vowel that disappears or loses its
quality because of its position in the word. Examples are:
kanara ‘their (two) food’, where the second a is reduced
molukluk ‘forgetful’ and moalkoahla ‘to forget’ where the u between l and k has been reduced
alij ‘beard’ and oaljoa ‘his beard’, where the i has been reduced
rong ‘to hear’ and koaronge ‘to listen’, where the o is reduced
Whether or not to indicate a reduced vowel is perhaps the most
difficult problem in Mokilese spelling. In the spelling system
used here, reduced vowels are never indicated unless:
i) related forms exist in which the vowel is not reduced
ii) speakers of Mokilese recognize these forms as related.
Of course, it is possible that, in many cases, the related forms
mentioned in i) have not yet been identified. Also, it is very difficult to determine whether speakers of a language consider two
words to be related. These problems have led to many inconsistencies in the treatment of reduced vowels.
Even if both conditions i) and ii) hold, a reduced vowel is
usually not written if it has been obliterated entirely. Thus, reduced vowels are written in:
kurujek ‘to grind’, from kuruj ‘to grind something’
kanara ‘their (two) food’, related to kanah ‘his food’
but not in:354Appendix A
maldek ‘to unfold’, from malad ‘to unfold something’
moalkoahla ‘to forget’, related to molukluk ‘forgetful’
where the vowels in question have been obliterated.
This system is far from satisfactory and many inconsistencies regrettably remain. Any modifications must await
further research.","[384, 385, 386]"
