chochoi in 58, he actually means ‘Yes, it is the case that I don’t
eat papayas’. Similarly, B’s use of ng diak in 59 corresponds to“No, it is not the case that I don’t eat papayas—i.e., I do eat them’.",[201]
"We found it necessary to introduce many different facts about
Palauan pronouns simply because the use of pronouns is so closely
tied up with problems of the spelling and the grammar. Thus,
in 1.5.d we discussed how the different sets of Palauan pronouns
are to be spelled; in 2.4 we examined some of the distributional
characteristics which pronouns share with nouns, in addition to
showing why the distinction human vs. non-human is important
to pronoun usage; and, finally, in 3.2-3 we analyzed the possessor
pronouns (or suffixes) extensively. There are still many facts about
Palauan pronouns which we have not presented; this will be donein the present chapter.
As we saw in 1.5.d, some Palauan pronouns are spelled as
separate words, while others are spelled as part of another word.
We shall call the former type independent pronouns, whereas the
latter type will be referred to as affix pronouns.! Affix pronouns
never occur alone but must always be attached to the beginning orend of a word: in the former case they are prefixes, while in the
latter case they are suffixes. ThesetwoIst pers. sg.2nd pers. sg.

"LIMITEDPERFECTIVEFORMSThere are many Palauan verbs whose meaning determines that
they can take only inanimate objects—i.e., ones that are nonhuman and non-living. For example, the actions described by
verbs like meluches ‘write’, mengitakl ‘sing’, melasech ‘carve’,
mengiis ‘dig’, menguiu ‘read’, etc. can only be directed at things: in
other words, human beings (and animals) cannot be ‘written’,‘sung’, ‘carved’, ‘dug’, or ‘read’. For this reason, the perfective
forms which such verbs can have are limited to those with the
third person singular object pronoun -/i (in which case reference is
made to an inanimate singular object) and to those with the third
person plural non-human object pronoun -@ (in which case reference is made to an inanimate plural object).

In the discussion to follow, we will call endings like -ek ‘my’,

meaning and distribution. We did not pay much attention, however, to the internal structure of nouns—that is, to the way certain
parts or units are put together to form words which function asand designate the possessor.! Any noun which consists of a noun
stem followed by a possessor suffix will be called a possessed
noun. Further terms will be introduced as needed.nouns. Most of the nouns cited in chap. 2 consist of only one
meaning-bearing unit (or morpheme); in other words, nouns like
ngalek ‘child’, ngikel ‘fish’, bilis ‘dog’, sers ‘garden’, chad ‘person’,
etc. cannot be broken down into two or more parts which individually have meaning. On the other hand, the plural words
discussed in 2.5 do consist of more than one meaning-bearingunit: for example, the single word rengalek is formed from the
prefix re-, which means or designates ‘plural’, and the noun stem
ngalek ‘child’. We use the term stem to refer to a noun when it
appears in combination with something else—in this case, theplural prefix re-. Can you identify the noun stems in the words
resensei ‘teachers’, rechad ‘people’, and rekangkodang ‘tourists’?
Nouns also function as stems in words like sersek ‘my garden’

sets.” Each set contains seven different suffixes which correspond
to the seven pronouns of Palauan (see chap. 4) and which can
be distinguished from each other in terms of various combinationsof person and number. As we saw in 2.4, a first person pronoun is
one which refers to the speaker, a second person pronoun is one
which refers to the person addressed, and a third person pronoun
has to do with some third party who is being talked about. Number
involves a distinction between singular and plural: the former
applies to one person or thing, while the latter applies to two or
more persons or things. The chart below gives the seven possessorchim ‘hand’ are followed by -ek and -a/, which identify the person

"In 13e, the original noun phrase of possession is rrat er a ngelekek
‘my child’s bicycle’, in which the possessor is expressed in a
possessor phrase introduced by the relational word er because the
noun rrat ‘bicycle’ is unpossessible (cf. 3.8). When the possessor ispreposed in such cases, a trace of it must be left in the form of a
pronoun following the relational word er. Since the relational
word er can only be followed by emphatic pronouns (ef. 4.3), the
pronominal trace in 13e must be the 3rd pers. sg. emphatic
pronoun ngii.

"SYSTEMOFPALAUANIn the preceding chapter we described the sound system of Palauan
in terms of its significant sounds (phonemes) and their variants
(allophones). In our analysis, we grouped these phonemes into
various classes—e.g., stop consonants, nasal consonants, high
vowels, mid vowels, etc.—whose members share common features
of pronunciation and show similarities in distribution, which
refers to the way in which sounds combine with each other inthe formation of words. For example, the class of nasal consonants m and ng is distinguished from the other types of Palauan
consonants by having a nasal articulation, in which the outward
air flow escapes through the nose, but not the mouth; furthermore, the nasals m and ng share the distributional feature of
appearing as syllabic consonants ([m] and [y] or [n]—cf. 1.3.5)before other consonants in word-initial position. To take another
example, the liquid consonants / and r are distinguished phonetically from the other groups of consonants because they alone areproduced with a partial closure in the mouth; moreover, / and r
have the unique distributional feature of appearing as “‘double”
consonants // and rr, which no other consonants can do.
We have seen, then, that in order to describe the sound system
of Palauan, we grouped the sounds into classes and specified the
distributional characteristics of these classes. In describing thegrammatical system of Palauan, our approach will be very similar,
though in this case the “building blocks” of our analysis will bewords rather than sounds. Thus, in order to get a clear picture of
the grammatical system of Palauan, we will classify the words of
the language into various groups called parts of speech and de-scribe the distributional characteristics common to the members
of each group. Just as there are restrictions in all languages on theOFPALAUANNOUNSNouns constitute one of the most important parts of speech in
Palauan. As a very rough preliminary definition, let us say that
nouns name or make reference to many different types of things or
living beings. Nouns are like identification labels which point to
the various persons and things which we deal with in daily life andtalk about in everyday conversation. We can divide nouns into
several subgroups, depending on what the noun refers to.
The easiest nouns to identify are those whose referents can be
perceived by one or more of our five senses. Nouns of this type,
which identify things we can see, hear, touch, taste, or smell, are
called concrete nouns. It is convenient to divide the concrete
nouns of Palauan into two categories—human and nonhuman.",[27]

“He wants me to study.’e. Palauan has many word sequences which function to ex-press a single meaning or idea and which often have single
English words as their equivalents. Even though we might want to
spell these sequences as single words, detailed grammatical analysis leads us to conclude that they actually involve more than one
word and should therefore be spelled as in the examples below:32SOUNDS

sounds which are not native to Palauan. In order to spell these
sounds, it is necessary to use non-Palauan letters such as p, f, j, y,
and w. Furthermore, the spelling of many native Palauan names,
including personal names like Yaoch, Polloi, etc. as well as place
names like Peleliu, Kayangel, etc., does not conform exactly to therules presented above. We should not be surprised or disturbed
that Palauan personal names in particular show so much deviationfrom the “standard” rules of Palauan spelling. This is perhaps as
it should be, since names are very individual things.
Second, words of foreign origin—especially technical terms—
often appear in Palauan speech. Since these words contain sounds
which are not native to Palauan, it becomes necessary in some
cases to use non-Palauan letters. If the word is borrowed from
Japanese and contains no sounds strange to Palauan, it should
be possible to spell this word only with Palauan letters, as in basio‘place’ and iasai ‘vegetables’. If, however, the Japanese word contains sounds which do not occur in Palauan, then it is necessary touse non-Palauan letters such as z and /.!1 Words of this type includedaiziob‘common,‘all right’,skozio‘airport’,benzioFORFURTHERSTUDYPalauan sounds and our phonetic transcriptions of Palauan words

noun, as in the following examples:

with the prefixes beke- and seke-, the use of such words appears to
be declining, especially among younger speakers. These prefixes
may be related to each other (note that they share the syllable
-ke-), but their development is not clear; furthermore, beke- may
contain the prefix be- discussed in 7.5 above. State verbs formedwith beke- and seke- are very difficult to analyze because many
Palauan speakers have different opinions about their acceptability
and their meaning.",[98]

following example:
bab

the expression mio er a uche ‘won’ (lit. ‘went to the front of’) (pronounced as if spelled mloruche) seems to blend the concepts of being
first in space and being first in time.
9. Chelsel ‘inside’ is used in cases like this because taoch ‘channel (in
a mangrove swamp)’ and omoachel ‘river’ are viewed as enclosed
spaces into which the boat has entered by means of some opening orpassageway.

2. The slang expression mo bad ‘go to sleep’ means, literally, ‘become

verb form containing the 3rd pers. sg. hypothetical pronoun /e-. The
fact that the clause following me a lechub is introduced by ¢ lends
support to this speculation, since e introduces consequential clauses
which follow conditional clauses (cf, 19.1 and 19.3).

‘They killed twenty-four people.’As we have seen before, in order to form a plural noun in Palauan,
we simply attach re- to the beginning of the noun. (If the noun
begins with a vowel, then re- will be shortened to r-.) Because reprecedes the noun to which it is attached, it is called a prefix; thehyphen in our notation re- indicates that something must follow
the prefix to form a whole word. We have also noted that re- can
only be added to human nouns: in other words, it is only in the
category of human nouns that Palauan speakers make a distinction between singular (referring to just one person) and plural
(referring to two or more persons). This fact is another justi-fication for making the basic distinction human vs. non-humanWe have the option of omitting the plural prefix re- from the
examples of 25 because re- does not seem to add anything to themeaning: in each case, the presence of the number word (tg/olem
‘six (people)’, teruich ‘ten’, etc.) makes it clear that two or more
human beings are being talked about.
The plural prefix re- can also attach to certain other words—
e.g., ua ‘like, as’ and bek ‘each, every—when these words areassociated with a human noun. Observe the following examples:

The sentences in 1’ are equational sentences containing two noun
phrases; in each case, the subject noun phrase (biang ‘beer’ or
rrom ‘liquor’) is being equated with one of the special possessed
nouns discussed in 17.1 above. Therefore, the interpretation ofl’a-b follows the “A is B” pattern, and the two sentences literally
mean something like ‘Beer is my liking’ and ‘Liquor is hisdisliking’ (which of course are not good English sentences).
Now, the equational sentences in 1’ are used relatively rarely
by Palauan speakers. Such sentences would only be uttered if the
speaker wishes to emphasize or single out a particular thing as the
thing he likes or dislikes. Thus, 1’a implies, for example, that it is
beer and only beer (out of a choice of several different beverages)
that the speaker has developed a taste for. For some reason, the

There are also differences in the individual sounds of a language which are non-contrastive.
