"The role of -e and -agi 329In (168), ang marks the topic (subject) of the clause. In (168a), the actor, babae
‘woman’ is subject and the verb takes future actor topic morphology (in bold).
In (168b), the theme (goal), bigas ‘rice’ is subject and the verb take future goal
topic morphology. (168c,d) show the same for direction (locative) and benefactive arguments. As illustrated amply in Schachter and Otanes 1972, in Tagalog,
the types of arguments that can be selected as subject and associated with distinct verbal (voice) morphology include actor, theme (goal), location/goal (direction), beneficiary, instrument, subject matter, time, manner, and others. The
first six of these are the same roles that can be core syntactic arguments in Madurese, and like Tagalog, each is associated with specific verbal morphology
(except when the theme is object and there is no overt affix).
There is, however, some question as to whether or not -e and -agi suffixes
are properly treated as voice morphemes. Most analyses of Indonesian-type
languages do not do so, and the Indonesian voice system is generally characterized as a two-voice system (Wolff 1996, Ross 2002, 2005). There have been
alternative views though. Naylor (1978) explicitly draws the parallel between
Philippine languages and Indonesian. Using the term ‘focus’ (as is standard in
some of the literature), Naylor identifies Indonesian -i as ‘locative focus’ and
-kan as ‘instrument focus’, and posits a null affix for ‘goal focus’ (marking
themes as objects). Verhaar (1984) treats -i and -kan as part of the same system
as the active (meng-) and passive (di-), referring to -i as the ‘locative role marker’ and describing -kan as marking one of five ‘semantic species’–’benefactive’,
‘instrument’, ‘dative-accusative’, ‘accusative-accusative’, and ‘noncausative’.
Additionally, he identifies men...i and men...kan as circumfixes ‘deriving menverbs’ (1984:6), underscoring an analysis in which actor voice and -i and -kan
are part of the same system. More recently, Musgrave, while stopping short of
analyzing Indonesian -i and -kan as part of the voice system, does provide four
arguments that ‘suggest that the Indonesian system is related’ to the Philippine
systems (2001:72).
The apparent derivational nature of -e and -agi suffixes (especially with
causatives) contributes to the applicative analysis. But the distinction between
derivation and inflection in Madurese is blurred, and it is far from crystal clear
that actor voice morphology is purely inflectional. As described in Chapter 3
and Chapter 4, many lexical items denoting nominal entities can be used as
verbs when affixed with the actor voice morpheme. Examples of this include:
(169)root

pacol ‘hoe’

The left-hand column appears to consist of a list of nouns and the right-hand
column as verbs derived from them through affixation of ng- or a-. Additionally, as the affixation of ng- or a- creates an argument-taking predicate, this
process introduces an argument slot into the lexical item, much as an applicative
morpheme can. This increases the parallelism between some uses of -e and -agi
and ng- and a-. Clearly, when used with transitive and ditransitive verb roots,
actor voice morphology is not always associated with an increase in the valence
of its host or derives a verb from an item from a different lexical category. It is
equally clear that the same is true of -e and -agi. Outside of causatives, -e and
-agi do not add to the semantic valence of the verbs to which they are affixed.
Thus, -e and -agi are no more straightforwardly derivational than is actor voice
ng- and a-.
Other analyses of the facts in (169) are, of course, conceivable. The forms
in the left-hand column need not be analyzed as nouns. It is possible that they
are zero-derived verbs (such as hammer and saw in English), in which case the
actor voice forms in the right-hand column are simply inflected verbs. That said,
there is no particular evidence that determines such an analysis as necessarily
correct. Discussion in Chapter 3 section 3.4 suggests the possibility of analyzing
these as precategorial roots. But such an analysis entails that the actor voice
morphology in these cases derives a verb from a precategorial root. The precategorial root analysis for Philippine languages entails that voice morphology
there is associated with derivation of just this sort (Foley 1998, Kroeger 1998,
Himmelmann 2007). So, in this view, Philippine voice is derivational and not
inflectional. If Austronesian voice systems (including that of Madurese) should
be considered purely inflectional or derivational begs an easy answer.
The distribution of -e and -agi points to an additional similarity to Tagalog voice. While -e and -agi can occur with verbs taking actor voice, speakersThe role of -e and -agi 331treat some of these as ‘possible, but odd’, sometimes distinctly so. More importantly, actual usage indicates that outside of causatives, verbs with -e and -agi
largely occur in object voice. That is, in the overwhelming majority of noncausative cases, -e and -agi occur when a location, goal, beneficiary, instrument,
or subject matter argument is subject. This is comparable to the function of actor voice and object voice: they indicate what the thematic role of the subject is
or is not. In a similar way, in most instances -e and -agi actually serve to indicate the role of the subject not the object. Textual evidence follows.
In connected discourse, such as the narrative texts in Chapter 16, the distribution of actor voice and object voice fluctuates between roughly 50/50 to a
40/60 split with object voice verbs predominating. For example, in the story Ke
Moko, the raw count in transitive clauses is 50 actor voice and 64 object voice,
roughly a 44/56 ratio. As the repeated use of a particular verb in a given text
may skew the results, this potentially confounding effect can be factored out by
considering only the number of distinct verbs used in each voice; in Ke Moko
doing so changes the counts to 27 actor voice and 41 object voice, roughly a
40/60 ratio. If use of -e and -agi were unrelated to subject selection, the ratio of
actor voice/object voice for -e and the ratio of actor voice/object voice for -agi
should be similar to the general actor voice/object voice ratio. In Ke Moko this
appears to be true of -e, which has a raw count of 4 actor voice and 5 object
voice. However, it is not true of -agi. Verbs with the -agi suffix occur in 1 actor
voice clause and 14 object voice clauses. Of the 15 tokens, 2 are causative, including the lone instance of actor voice. Given the relatively small number of
tokens, any one text might not be representative. The results for an additional
three stories is given in (170), along with the results for Ke Moko.","[345, 346, 347, 348]"

bedded clauses (see Chung 1976 and Kana 1986 for Indonesian, Davies 1990
for Javanese, Arka 2003 for Balinese, and Kurniawan 2010). These analyses
liken the structure of these sentences to the English sentence in (100).
(100) Kate is believed by many to have been selected Daughter of the Year.
However, the facts surrounding the Madurese sentences indicate that the structure more closely parallels the English sentence in (101).
(101) Many believe of Kate that she was selected Daughter of the Year.
The English construction is akin to what has been referred to by Higgins (1981)
as ‘prolepsis’ in Zacapoaxtla Nahuat and in Ancient Greek and Latin, in which
an apparent nonthematic object in the matrix clause anticipates the referent of
that object as a thematic argument of the embedded clause. Examination of the
Madurese structures indicates many differences between sentences such as
(98b) and (99b) and the grammatical properties generally cited as characteristic
of raising structures but points to similarities between the Madurese and prolepsis structures.
The structures in the a-sentences and the b-sentences have obvious differences inasmuch as the matrix verb is in actor voice in one and object voice in
the other. This not a necessity for the prolepsis structure, however. Although a
subtle difference, (102b) is a prolepsis structure while (102a) is not.
(102) a. Siti ngera
ja' Ina mangkat ka Jakarta are Kemmes.
to Jakarta day Thursday
Siti AV.think COMP Ina leave
‘Siti thinks that Ina left for Jakarta on Thursday.’
b. Siti ngera
Ina ja' mangkat ka Jakarta are Kemmes.
to Jakarta day Thursday
Siti AV.think Ina COMP leave
‘Siti thinks about Ina that she left for Jakarta on Thursday.’
The only difference between the two structures is that in (102a), the basic structure, the complement subject Ina, follows the complementizer ja' while in
(102b) Ina precedes ja'. However, the verb kera ‘think’ is exceptional in that it
has precisely the same form in the basic and prolepsis structures. In all other
cases, the matrix verb has additional morphology, either the locative -e suffix or
the -agi suffix in the prolepsis structures. The b-sentences are translated here as
instances of prolepsis.
(103) a. Guru-na
yaken Bambang bakal lulus ujiyan.
teacher-DEF sure Bambang will pass exam
‘The teacher is sure Bambang will pass the exam.’Prolepsis 359b. Guru-na
ng-yaken-ne Bambang ja' bakal lulus ujiyan.
teacher-DEF AV-sure-LOC Bambang COMP will pass exam
‘The teacher is sure about Bambang that he will pass the exam.’
(104) a. Ina a-bala ka Ebu' ja' Nabun a-berri' konce juwa
Ina AV-say to mother COMP Nabun AV-give key that
dha' Sa'diyah.
to Sa'diyah
‘Ina said to Mother that Nabun gave the key to Sa'diyah.’
b. Ina a-bala'-agi Nabun ka Ebu'
ja' a-berri' konce juwa
Ina AV-say-AGI Nabun to mother COMP AV-give key that
dha' Sa'diyah.
to Sa'diyah
‘Ina said about Nabun to mother that she gave the key to Sa'diyah.’
In (103b), the locative suffix -ne and concomitant actor voice marking indicate
that Bambang is a matrix dependent, differentiating it from the embedding construction in (103a). And in (104b), the suffix -agi in and the fact that Nabun
precedes a matrix clause argument, ka Ebu' ‘to mother’, indicate that Nabun is a
matrix dependent, unlike (104a). So, the basic embedding structure is distinguishable from the prolepsis structure on the basis of word order and morphology.
The suffixal morphology has the same function here as it does elsewhere.
As described in Chapter 10, -e and -agi indicate that what is a prepositional
argument in basic structure has been selected as a core argument: the locative
suffix indicating that a goal is a core argument and -agi indicating that a benefactive argument, instrumental argument, subject matter argument and so on is a
core argument. There are synonymous sentences in which the additional matrix
dependent in the b-sentences occurs in a prepositional phrase. The sentence in
(105) is synonymous with (103b).
(105) Guru-na
yaken ka Bambang ja' bakal lulus ujiyan.
teacher-DEF sure to Bambang COMP will pass exam
‘The teacher is sure about Bambang that he will pass the exam.’
In (105), Bambang, which is the actor of the embedded clause, is object of the
preposition ka 'to' in the matrix clause. Thus, the presence of the locative suffix
in (103b) parallels that in (106b), in which the goal argument that is object of
the preposition ka 'to' in (106a) occurs as a core argument.","[374, 375, 376]"
"The role of -e and -agi 327followed by theme (here tanangnga ‘their hands’). However, the theme can
precede the causee, in which case overt definite marking on the causee is preferred and a slight pause or rising intonation precedes the causee (163).

tanang-nga na'-kana' juwa.
teacher-DEF AV.CS-RED-hold-AN hand-DEF RED-child that
‘The teacher made the children hold one another’s hands.’
As saleng is cliticized to the following verb, the unmarked order of elements
following masaleng is as in (161), verb - causee - theme, teggu' na'-kana' tanangnga ‘hold children their hands’. However, for some speakers the reverse
order of causee and verb is acceptable, and (164) is considered a possible variant, indicating that the causative + saleng together form a verbal unit.
(164) Guru-na
ma-saleng na'-kana' teggu' tanang-nga.
teacher-DEF AV.CS-DIST RED-child hold hand-DEF
‘The teacher made the children hold one another’s hands.’
Non-reciprocal distributive and collective clitics also can take causative
morphology, as in (165) and (166), respectively.
(165) Siti ma-saleng Ali ban Hasan nokol Bambang.
Siti AV.CS-DIST Ali and Hasan AV.hit Bambang
‘Siti made both Ali and Hasan hit Bambang.’
(166) Guru-na
ma-bareng berka' Ali ban Bambang.
teacher-DEF AV.CS-COLL run Ali and Bambang
‘The teacher made Ali and Bambang run together.’
Again, the causative morpheme + clitic appear to form a verbal unit as the order
of elements following is somewhat fluid. For example, in (166) the verb berka'
‘run’ precedes the causee Ali ban Bambang while in the synonymous (167), the
causee precedes the verb.
(167) Guru-na
ma-bareng Ali ban Bambang a-berka'.
teacher-DEF AV.CS-COLL Ali and Bambang AV-run
‘The teacher made Ali and Bambang run together.’
4. The role of -e and -agi
Outside their use in causatives, the presence of -e and -agi in a clause largely328Chapter 10 Modifications to argument structureindicates that an argument that is syntactically oblique in the basic usage of the
verb is a core argument in the clause. The data in section 1 demonstrate that -e
is correlated with the presence of a core argument bearings a locative thematic
role, including goal and goal-stimulus roles. The data in section 2 illustrate a
correlation between -agi and the presence of a core argument with benefactive,
instrumental, or subject matter thematic role. While generally considered applicative affixes in the literature on closely related languages (Arka 2003 on Balinese, Musgrave 2001 and Ross 2002 on Indonesian, Donohue 1999 on Tukang
Besi), in these instances, these affixes actually parallel the function of the voice
morphology. Specifically, as -e/-agi indicate linking of specific thematic roles
with core argument status, actor voice indicates that the subject bears the actor/agent role and object voice indicates that the theme or some other non-actor
argument is the subject. Viewed in this way, -e and -agi (in these uses) might be
correctly considered part of the voice system and not merely applicative affixes.
On this view, Madurese is more closely allied with other western Austronesian languages recognized as having more highly articulated voice systems,
languages such as the Philippine languages, Formosan languages, and Malagasy. For example, in Philippine languages, arguments bearing many different
thematic roles can serve as subject of a clause. Special verbal morphology occurs depending on the role of the argument selected as subject. The sentences in
(168) from Tagalog illustrate.
(168) Tagalog (Schachter 1976:494-495)1

1Schachter (1976) and Schachter and Otanes (1972) refer to the subject as the 'topic'.
Here T = topic, A = actor, G = goal, D = direction, and B = benefactive. Thus AT = actor
topic , GT = goal topic, and so on.","[343, 344, 345]"

Rudi believe
‘Rudi believes him.’
(75) Wati enga'.
Wati remember
‘Wati remembered it.’
(76) Hasan baji'.

‘Hasan hates him.’
The sentences in (74-76) are common cases of null pronouns. (See Chapter 13
for more on null pronouns.) It is thus possible to identify subcategories of stative predicates of experience. Those that are obligatorily transitive include: baji'
‘hate’, enga' ‘remember’, esto ‘love’, kasta ‘regret’, lebur ‘like’, loppa ‘forget’,
ngarte ‘understand’, parcaja ‘believe’, tao ‘know’, tresna ‘love’, yaken ‘be
sure’, and others.
4.3. Transitive clauses
Dynamic transitive verbs are both semantically and syntactically transitive in
their active form. Semantically they can largely be characterized as those predicates which take an actor argument (that which initiates or carries out the action,
prototypically an agent) and a theme (that which is affected by the action, prototypically a patient). Syntactically, the basic order in a transitive clause is subject
- verb - object, the object taking neither prepositional nor case marking. Morphologically, the verb obligatorily takes actor voice marking in the active,
which in other works is taken to be the neutral form and which is what is offered by speakers in direct elicitation situations. The sentences in (77-80) illustrate.
(77) Ebu' melle berras.
mother AV.buy rice
‘Mother buys rice.’
(78) Embi' rowa ngekke' Ale'.
goat that AV.bite yngr.sibling
‘That goat bit little sister.’Verbal clauses 163(79) Ita maca tang buku.
Ita AV.read my book
‘Ita read my book.’
(80) Bu Yus noles
sorat.
Mrs Yus AV.write letter
‘Bu Yus wrote a letter.’
In each sentence the subject precedes the verb and initiates the action. The morphologically unmarked object follows the verb and is affected in some sense by
the action. As can be expected, there is a large number of verbs that belong to
this category. Voice marking on transitive verbs is discussed more thoroughly
in Chapter 9 section 1.
4.4. Ditransitive clauses
Finally, there are a number of three-place verbs that occur as predicates of active clauses. Semantically, these verbs take an actor argument, a theme argument, and a location or goal as a third argument. Syntactically they are identical
to transitive verbs with the addition of a prepositional phrase (the location or
goal argument). These sentences have a basic subject - verb - object - PP word
order, and the verb obligatorily takes voice morphology. These properties are
evident in the sentences in (81-83).
(81) Hadi ngerem paket ka Bambang.
Hadi AV.send package to Bambang
‘Hadi sent a package to Bambang.’
(82) Sengko' nyaba' buku neng meja.
AV.put book on table
I
‘I put the book on the table.’
(83) Bapa' a-berri' pesse dha' oreng se lapar.
father AV-give money to man REL hungry
‘Father gave money to the hungry man.’
There is a small number of root verbs that fall into this category including bagi
‘give’, tambu ‘throw’, and a number of verbs of communication and others, e.g.
nempak ‘kick’, that are optionally ditransitive. However, there are many derived
verbs that act as predicates in ditransitive clauses. These are detailed in Chapter
10.","[178, 179, 180]"
"Open class categories 75reason that only these types of lexical items can occur in comparative and superlative constructions while dynamic verbs cannot may be that properties are
the only type concept that can be compared. If this is the appropriate explanation, the category adjective may be unnecessary. Adjectives may simply comprise a subcategory of verbs–’intransitive stative verbs’. In fact, adjectival predicates and intransitive dynamic verbs such as entar ‘go’, elang ‘disappear’,
kerem ‘sink’, labu ‘fall’ and a host of others share a property that distinguishes
them from most other verbs, including intransitive agentive verbs such as jalan
‘walk’, langoy ‘swim’ and others: they both lack any voice marking in their
basic use.
(39) a. Mored reya penter.
student this smart
‘This student is smart.’
b. Bengko rowa raja.
house that big
‘That house is big.’
(40) a. Mored rowa entar.
student that go
‘That student goes.’
b. Parao rowa kerem.
ship that sink
‘That ship sank.’
As discussed in Chapter 9, most other intransitive and transitive verbs must be
marked for voice in non-imperative sentences.
Adjectives, therefore, can be viewed as one kind of intransitive–
intransitive stative verbs–as opposed to the class of intransitive dynamic verbs.
Conceivably, the same semantic difference between these two classes of intransitive verbs could account for the facts surrounding the ce’ X-na intensive construction. Again, properties may simply be more amenable to this type of quantification than are dynamic expressions.
However, there still remains the distributional property of noun modification. Recall that only adjectives (or ‘intransitive stative verbs’) can directly
modify nouns. Other verbs cannot be used attributively but only predicatively.
Whether this can be explained solely in terms of the semantics of the verbs in
question is unclear. It has been argued that verb roots can be used in this way in
other related languages. For example, Klamer (1998) argues against a distinct
category adjective in Kambera, a language spoken on Sumba in central Indonesia, in part because many Kambera verbs can be used as attributive nominal76 Chapter 3 Lexical categories
modifiers.
In the end the issue could well boil down to whether one is predisposed to
recognize a lexical class of adjectives wholly distinct from verbs. Those who do
may cite the properties illustrated above as evidence. Those who do not must
recognize a subcategory of verbs, stative intransitive verbs, which differ from
other intransitive verbs on the basis of these same properties. The evidence on
either side is equivocal, but theoretical parsimony favors dispensing with the
additional category. Taking a somewhat jaundiced view, one might agree with
Croft (2005: 435), “Since everyone is selective for their own opportunistic theoretical reasons, debates on whether there are languages with a “noun”/”verb”
distinction, or languages without “adjectives”, cannot ever be resolved.” Despite the conclusion that adjectives should be considered a subcategory of verb
and not a wholly distinct lexical class, I will continue to refer to some lexical
items as ‘adjectives’ for ease of identification.
1.4. Precategorial roots
The issue of precategorial roots was touched on above. A precategorial root is a
lexical root that can function syntactically as either a noun or a verb with no
derivational morphology. Inflectional morphology associated both with verbs,
e.g. agreement and tense morphology, and with nouns, e.g. case and number
morphology, is directly applicable to the root. Madurese contains a modest
number of roots that exhibit this property, illustrated previously with the root
tokol ‘hammer’. This most frequently and obviously presents itself in the case
of roots that one might most naturally consider noun roots, including instrumental concepts such as are' ‘scythe’, pacol ‘hoe’, kaca ‘glass/mirror’, jala ‘net’,
sapo ‘broom’ and others, occupations and work locations such as tokang ‘artisan’, tane ‘farm’, warung ‘small shop’ and others, and various other roots.
When used as declarative verbs, these roots invariably take an actor voice prefix, either ng- (which is subject to assimilation) or a-. Examples are given in
(41-43).14
(41) a. Kaca jarowa bassa.
glass that
broken
‘That mirror broke.’14If one were to take these as noun roots, the prefixation of the actor voice could be
characterized as deriving a verb with a meaning something like ‘do an appropriate activity with N’. If one were to take them as verb roots, the derivation from verb to noun
would simply be conversion with the meaning ‘thing used to V’. The former seems
more likely than the latter, but ultimately the issue is not particularly significant.","[91, 92, 93]"
"455931238Siti Lalumba49571415In the three additional stories, the actor voice/object voice ratio is similar to that
in Ke Moko. The numbers of -e and -agi verbs show more fluctuation. However,
the results taken together clearly indicate that a large majority of the -e and -agi332Chapter 10 Modifications to argument structureverbs occur in the object voice, thus indicating that an important if not principal
function of -e and -agi is, in fact, in service of identifying the role of the subject.
Viewed this way, -e and -agi appear to be part of the same morphological system as actor voice and object voice. And the function of them all combined
parallels the role of voice morphology in western Austronesian languages, identifying the subject (or topic or focus) of a clause.
It is also the case that the distribution of Madurese voice (+ applicative)
morphology can be quite similar to that of Philippine languages. A comparison
of the relative occurrence of actor voice, object voice, and object voice + applicative morphology reported in Davies 2005 demonstrated that the pattern of
distribution was quite comparable to that reported for Cebuano in Bell 1988.
The comparison is given in (171). (The terminology for Cebuano voice categories is that used in Bell 1988. It differs somewhat from Schachter’s 1976 terminology for Tagalog, which is the terminology most widely used in the literature
on Philippine languages.)

instances of -e and -agi combined with object voice. The ‘total object voice’
category combines object voice, -e and -agi, which is comparable to Bell’s cover term ‘goal-topic’, the category comprised of all the non-agent-topic instances
of voice morphology. As is clear from this table, as well as the figures for the
Madurese texts given in (170), the combined effect of object voice and the applicative affixes is quite similar to Bell’s tallies for Cebuano. Clearly, the statistics and their comparison is neither rigorous nor definitive. However, the remarkably similarity across the two languages is suggestive. The applicative
morphology together with the voice morphology give a result quite like that of
the richer voice systems found in some other Western Austronesian languages.
Despite this suggestion, it is clear that treating the -agi suffix as a part of
the voice system of Madurese is no closer to providing a unified analysis thanThe role of -e and -agi 333any other account. There are instances of the suffix that clearly do not conform
to such an analysis. As shown in section 2.1, -agi can occur when the beneficiary is not linked to any core argument position but remains a prepositional
object, as in (83), repeated here.
(83) Sa'diyah melle-yagi permen kaangguy na'-kana'.
RED-child
Sa'diyah AV.buy-AGI candy for
‘Sa'diyah bought candy for the children.’
Additionally, the data in section 2.3 illustrate a use of -agi in which it appears to
specify the endpoint (either beginning or end) of the path of the theme object, as
in (99b).
(99) a. Nembug bato-na.

‘They piled up the stones.’
b. Nembug-gagi bato-na neng Masjid Agung Bangkalan.
AV-pile-AGI stone-DEF at

‘They piled up the stones at the Agung Bangkalan Mosque.’
Thus, the same type of data that Son & Cole (2008) cite as undercutting their
proposal for a unified syntactic analysis of Indonesian -kan (Cole & Son 2004)
prove problematic for an argument-structure analysis (of either the type outlined
here or that of Cole & Son 2004) for Madurese -agi. Likewise, however, the
semantic analysis of Son & Cole (2008) in terms of -agi contributing an abstract
result meaning faces difficulties when applied to data such as (83), which yields
no semantic difference from the sentence without the suffix, (74a), and its use
with verbs of communication, where the distinction is one of emphasis but not
of any result semantics.

which must be taken into account in examining whether result semantics are
dependent on the -agi suffix. However, at this point, the entire issue remains
unresolved.","[348, 349, 350, 351]"

Lexical categoriesThis chapter considers the issue of what lexical categories should be recognized
in Madurese. As in any language, there are both open class categories–
categories that readily admit new items either through coinage or borrowing–
and closed class categories–those that resist new items. For the most part, the
set of closed class categories identifiable in Madurese is similar to those in related languages: pronouns, demonstratives, numerals and quantifiers, prepositions, adverbs, auxiliaries, conjunctions and assorted particles.
An issue of potential contention in analyses of Austronesian languages is
identifying the set of open class categories, basically the categories corresponding to noun, verb, and adjective in Indo-European languages. The majority of
recent analyses posit a distinction between nouns and verbs. However, they are
divided about whether to recognize a class of adjectives distinct from verbs.
Although adjective has been recognized as a separate class in much early work,
this may simply reflect the lens of the Western grammatical tradition through
which they were viewed. Recently, a number of linguists have argued on the
basis of morphological properties and syntactic distribution that in many Austronesian languages a category of adjective distinct from verbs is unwarranted
(e.g. Donohue 1999, Klamer 1998, van den Berg 1989) Further, in some of
these languages the line dividing nouns and verbs is somewhat blurred. For
instance, Foley (1998) has proposed that the noun/verb distinction is irrelevant
in Tagalog (and by extension other Philippine languages). Rather, roots are
‘precategorial’ and lexical classes are identifiable only from the syntactic environment in which the word occurs.1 Regardless of the correctness or incorrectness of this proposal for a particular language, sets of precategorial roots have
been suggested for a number of Austronesian languages in which the noun/verb
distinction is posited.
Section 1 examines open class items and proposes that Madurese includes
the categories noun and verb and a subcategory adjective. It also takes up the
issue of precategorial roots. The remaining lexical classes are briefly discussed
and exemplified in section 2.","[77, 78]"
"Closed class categories 83determines whether it is to be interpreted as first, second, or third person. The
alternative is to combine the appropriate pronoun with the quantifier kabbi ‘all’,
as in (68).
(68) sengko' kabbi ‘we’
ba'na kabbi ‘you’
aba'na kabbi ‘they’
As there is no case marking on NPs in Madurese, with the exception of
the first person singular possessive, the same pronominal forms are used for any
grammatical role. The sentences in (69-72) illustrate.
(69) a. Sengko' entar dha' Lombok.

‘I went to Lombok.’
b. Ba'na melle buku.

3.1. Distribution of pronouns
Context plays a role not only in interpreting pronouns, but also in the distribution of pronouns. Pronouns in prepositional phrases and coordinate structures
are obligatory, but subject, object, non-prepositional agent, and possessive pronouns are optional. In fact, as is the case in many languages that allow them,
null pronouns are generally preferred when sanctioned. Thus, the sentences in
(35-37), all taken from narratives, have the interpretations ascribed to them in
the context of that narrative. (In the examples, pro occurs in the canonical position of a pronoun or NP.)
(35) Dhang-kadhang pro1 e-sambi pro2 keya dha’ pro1 e-bagi pro2 dha’ 
OV-bring
too to
OV-give
to
sometimes
Ke Moko keya.
Ke Moko too
‘Sometimes they would bring these to give to Ke Moko, too.’
(36) Bid-abid-da pate
gella’ dhateng nga-tela' pro. 
RED-long-DEF minister before come
AV.KA-see
‘After a while the minister came and saw him.’
(37) Mole
dha' disa-na
pro!
go.home to village-DEF
‘Go home to your villages!’
In (35), null pronouns take the place of subjects pro1 and post-verbal agents
pro2. In (36), the direct object of ngatela ‘see’ is a null pronoun. And in (37),
the null pronoun fills the position of the possessor. Pronominal anaphora as well
as reflexives and reciprocals are treated in detail in Chapter 13.
4. Demonstratives
Demonstratives are deictic elements that identify the location of a particular
entity or entities with respect to a particular discourse context. There is a twoway distinction for demonstratives: a proximal demonstrative used with items
that are near the speaker and a distal demonstrative used with items that are far
from the speaker and may be far from the addressee.","[205, 206]"
"Open class categories 73number of grammatical properties. There are, however, some ways in which the
two seem to differ. Adjectives but not verbs (or nouns) are able to combine with
the degree modifier ce' ‘very’ and the suffix -na to form an intensive construction: ce' precedes the adjective, which is marked with the definite suffix -na.11
(34) sala
‘wrong’
penter ‘smart’
kene' ‘small’
bengko ‘house’
saba
‘field’
bapa' ‘father’

ce' kene'na ‘very small’
*ce' bengkona
*ce' sabana
*ce' bapa'na
*ce' bacana
*ce' tolessa
*ce' entarraAdjectival roots can occur in comparative and superlative constructions, whereas verbs and nouns cannot. Examples in (35) illustrate this for superlatives.
(35) sala

paleng penter ‘smartest’
paleng kene' ‘smallest’
*paleng bengko
*paleng saba
*paleng bapa'
*paleng baca
*paleng toles
*paleng entarFinally, adjectival roots can directly modify nouns in post-nominal position.
Verbs which form the basis for nominal modifiers cannot occur in their root
form but require derivational or inflectional morphology and must occur in a
modifying relative clause to be grammatical. The examples in (36) show that
the adjective roots raja ‘big’, koros ‘thin’, and penter ‘smart’ occur as modifiers
in immediate postnominal position, while the uninflected verbal roots gabay
‘make, build’, terro ‘want’, kennal ‘know’, dhapa' ‘arrive’ cannot.12
11As discussed in Chapter 4 section 1.2.1, in the dialect spoken in Bangkalan, -na has
the allomorph -eng (/ə/) when affixed to a word ending in []. This occurs in the intensive construction as well, so ce' kene'na ‘very small’ surfaces as ce' kene'eng ([cɛ
kɛnɛə].
12
It is important to interpret the final four examples as NPs and not sentences. Some of
them might be acceptable as sentences to some speakers, e.g. Bungkos dhapa' ‘A pack-74 Chapter 3 Lexical categories
(36) bengko raja
‘large house’13
koceng koros
'skinny cat’
mored penter
‘smart student’
*bengko gabay
bengko se egabay
‘the house that was built’
*koceng terro
koceng se ekaterrowe ‘the cat that is wanted’
*mored kennal
mored se ekennale
‘the student that is known’
*bungkos dhapa' bungkos se dhapa'
‘the package that arrived’
1.3.3. A subcategory adjective
But are the differences in grammatical behavior sufficient to justify an autonomous category ‘adjective’? Rather than being a distinct lexical class, adjectives are very possibly a subcategory of verbal roots. Subcategories of verbs
must be recognized in any event. A distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs must be recognized on morphological grounds (voice marking) and
syntactic grounds (cooccurrence with a non-prepositional object). In (37), the
transitive verb baca ‘read’ takes actor voice morphology (here realized as the
homorganic nasal [m]) and occurs with a non-prepositional object. In (38), the
intransitive verb entar ‘go’ does not have the actor voice morphology (which
would result in ungrammaticality) and can have a goal in a prepositional phrase
(here dha' Sorbaja ‘to Surabaya’) but not a non-prepositional object.
(37) Ebu' maca buku.
mother AV.read book
‘Mother reads a book.’
(38) Ebu' entar dha' Sorbaja.
mother go
to Surabaya
‘Mother goes to Surabaya.’
Also, distinctions must be made between active and stative semantically transitive roots on similar morphological and syntactic grounds.
The morphological and syntactic differences between adjectives and other
verbal roots likely have an explanation in semantics. The adjective-like lexical
items in question describe properties, properties such as size (raja ‘big’), personal characteristic (penter ‘smart’), dimension (koros ‘skinny’) and so on. The
age arrived’. However, not all speakers will accept sentences in which the subject is not
marked definite, quantified, or possessed. As NPs, these collocations are unacceptable.
13
As detailed in Chapters 7 and 11, attributive adjectives such as raja ‘large’, koros
‘thin’, and penter ‘smart’ can also modify nouns as the predicate in a relative clause,
just as in English. So synonymous NPs would be bengko se raja ‘house that is large’,
koceng se koros ‘cat that is skinny’, and mored se penter ‘student that is smart’.","[89, 90, 91]"
"EMPH very sakti-DEF ‘Oh, this weapon is filled with magic power!’
(86) Keyae Bato Ampar takerjat, “Adhu, baji' se dhalem tabu'-eng
Kiai Bato Ampar surprised oh
baby REL inside stomach-DEF 
ba'eng jiya, Nyae, se a-jawab!” 

‘Kiai Bato Ampar was surprised, “Oh, Nyae, the baby inside you is the

(87) Adhu, mella'
mata kaula ano, Ka' mas!
Bisa ngatela' pole neka!
AV.open.eye eye I
do elder brother can AV.see again this
oh
‘Oh, I can see, Husband! I can see again!’
The exclamatory interjections begin each of the relevant clauses in these examples, and other emphatic particles joh and me' also occur in (84) and me' occurs
again in (85). In (84) and (85) the intensive construction with ce' ‘very’ also
occurs. In (87), which uses one of the higher speech levels, the subject inverts
with the verb and its object, mella' mata ‘open eyes’. These two properties
combine in a special exclamatory construction in which the subject follows the
intensive structure, (88-90).
(88) Ce' raddin-na
Ita!
very beautiful-DEF Ita
‘How beautiful Ita is!’
(89) Ce' nyaman-na nase' jiya!
very delicious-DEF rice this
‘How delicious this rice is!’Hortative clauses 165(90) Ce' penter-ra ana'-eng ba'eng!
very smart-DEF child-DEF you
‘How smart your child is!’
In this exclamatory structure, the intensive construction is in clause-initial position and the nominal of which the state is predicated follows. In (88) ce' raddinna ‘very beautiful’ precedes its subject Ita, and the same pattern occurs in (89)
and (90). Any of the exclamatory interjections may precede the intensive, as in
(91), where wa' occurs in clause-initial position.
(91) Wa', ce' bajjir-ra Bambang!
oh very lucky-DEF Bambang
‘Oh, how lucky Bambang is!’
6. Hortative clauses
Two words of exhortation are used in hortative clauses: mara and ayu' (sometimes pronounced ayo), which can roughly be translated as ‘let’s’ or ‘come on’.
In the case of an exhortation in which the speaker wishes to engage the listener(s) in a joint activity, typically mara or ayu' occurs clause initially, there is no
overt subject and the verb and its complements follow, as in (92) and (93).
(92) Mara/Ayu' maca buku!
HORT
AV.read book
‘(Come on,) Let’s read a book!’
(93) Mara/Ayu' nempak bal!
HORT
AV.kick ball
‘(Come on,) Let’s kick a ball!’
The verbs in (92) and (93), maca ‘read’ and nempak ‘kick’ occur in the actor
voice, as in regular transitive active clauses. Importantly, here the objects buku
and bal, respectively, are interpreted as indefinite. For some speakers, this indefinite interpretation is obligatory. If the object of the verb is definite, then the
verb must occur in the root form, with no voice morphology, as in (94) and
(95).
(94) Mara baca buku reya!
HORT read book this
‘Let’s read this book!’166 Chapter 6 Clause types
(95) Mara tempak bal-la!
HORT kick
ball-DEF
‘Let’s kick the ball!’
There is some variability with respect to the use of the actor voice morphology,
however. So, in (96) the actor voice form of gabay ‘make’ occurs with a definite object, here a null pronominal that refers to the are' or sickle shaped knife
being discussed. In (97), the location to be returned to is the definite name
Bangkalan.
(96) Dha'ramma ayu' mon a-gabay, kana'?
HORT if
AV-make child
how
‘Come on, how about we copy it, guys?’
(97) Ayu' a-bali
pole ka Bangkalan ya!
HORT AV-return again to Bangkalan yes
‘Come on, let’s go back to Bangkalan!’
Some speakers allow variability in word order as well. In (98), a variant
of (92), the verb and its complement precede ayu', and in (99), a variant of (94),
the definite object precedes the verb which precedes mara.
(98) %Maca buku ayu'!
AV.read book HORT
‘Let’s read a book!’
(99) %Buku reya, baca, mara!
book this read HORT
‘Let’s read this book!’
This inversion of word order is also found in the textual example in (100).
(100) Jajal ayu', kana', semma'-e!
try HORT child close-DUR
‘Let’s try to get closer, guys!’
In (100) the main verb jajal ‘try’ precedes ayu'.
Unlike the closely related imperatives (discussed in the following section), verbs in hortative clauses can occur in object voice.
(101) Mara e-edhing-agi!
HORT OV-hear-AGI
‘Come on, let’s listen to it!’Imperative clauses 167Finally, ayu' and mara are not restricted to use in hortative clauses in
which the speaker will act with the addressee. They are also used to exhort the
addressee(s) to action without the speaker’s involvement (102-103), and at
times emphasizing that the speaker’s action that will impact the addressee(s), as
in (104).
(102) Mara, Bing,
aba'eng la
cokop ya dibasa!
HORT daughter you
already enough yes mature
‘Come on, daughter, you are already old enough!’
(103) Pola me'
ta-papak bi' oreng ayu' menta!
maybe perhaps IN-stuck with person HORT AV.ask
‘If you meet the person (who owns it), go ahead and ask!’
(104) Mara engko' a-dungeng-a pole ya!
HORT I
AV-story-IRR again yes
‘Come on, I am going to tell a story again!’
In (102), in an attempt to convince his daughter that she should marry, a father
urges her to realize that she has reached a sufficient level of maturity to do so.
In (103), the speaker exhorts the addressee to act should the right circumstances
arise. And in (104), the speaker calls the addressees to attention as he is about to
perform for them.
7. Imperative clauses
Imperatives are formed by using the root form of the verb. Because of the
speech situation in which the speaker commands the addressee to perform some
action, a second person subject is assumed. The subject is generally a null pronoun, although an overt second person pronoun is also possible. The sentences
in (105-108) illustrate.
(105) Baca buku-na ba'eng!
read book-DEF you
‘Read your book!’
(106) Totop labang rowa!
close door that
‘Close that door!’168 Chapter 6 Clause types
(107) Kerem sorat dha' Nabun!
send letter to Nabun
‘Send a/the letter to Nabun!’
(108) Bagi buku reya dha' Hasan!
give book this to Hasan
‘Give this book to Hasan!’
As is the case with most clauses, the object may occur in initial position, but
only when it is definite. There is usually a rising intonation on the object followed by a brief pause. This order is illustrated in (109-111).
(109) Buku-na ba'eng, baca!
read
book-DEF you
‘Read your book!’
(110) Labang rowa, totop!
door
that close
‘Close that door!’
(111) Sorat, kerem dha' Nabun!
letter send to Nabun
‘Send the letter to Nabun!’
The sentences in (109-111) correspond to the sentences in (105-107), respectively, with the object front. However, while the unmarked object in sorat ‘letter’ in (107) can be interpreted either as indefinite or definite, when it is fronted,
only a definite interpretation is possible, (111).
It is not possible to use the object voice with imperatives. Doing so results
in an ungrammatical sentence, (112) and (113), regardless of whether the base
object is clause initial (a) or clause final (b).
(112) a. *Buku-na ba'eng e-baca!
book-DEF you OV-read
(Read your book!)
b. *E-baca buku-na ba'eng !
OV-read book-DEF you
(Read your book!)
(113) a. *Buku reya e-bagi dha' Hasan!
book this OV-give to Hasan
(Give this book to Hasan!)Imperative clauses 169b. *E-bagi buku reya dha' Hasan!
OV-give book this to
Hasan
(Give this book to Hasan!)
In this regard, Madurese differs from both Indonesian and Javanese, where a
passive imperative is acceptable.
When issuing an imperative in which the speaker commands the addressee to allow a third person to act, the verbs dina ‘leave’ and penneng ‘leave’ are
used.
(114) Dina, Ahmad me' maca buku-na!
leave Ahmad EMPH AV.read book-DEF
‘Let Ahmad read his book!’
lit. ‘Leave Ahmad to read his book!’
(115) Penneng, Tina a-dungeng!
leave
Tina AV-story
‘Let Tina tell her story!’
lit. ‘Leave Tina to tell her story.’
A special negative form ja', and its variant nja', is used for prohibitive
imperatives. This is illustrated in (116) and (117).
(116) Ja' pokol Salim!
don’t hit
Salim
‘Don’t hit Salim!’
(117) Ja' baca tang sorat!
don’t read my letter
‘Don’t read my letter!’
As described in Chapter 5 section 3.1.3, frequently with negative imperatives
the verb is reduplicated.
(118) Ja' ter-kobater!
don’t RED-worry
‘Don’t worry!’
(119) Ja' ka'-bukka'!
don’t RED-open
‘Don’t open it!’170 Chapter 6 Clause types
The reduplication serves to emphasize the command of the speaker as well as to
indicate that the prohibition is to continue indefinitely (or at least some considerable time into the future), an imperfective meaning.
8. Comparative and superlative clauses
There are multiple constructions available for comparing two or more objects
with respect to a particular property. In one, the adjectival verb takes both the aprefix and the -an suffix simultaneously. The subject of the clause is the entity
which is ascribed the greater degree of some property than the comparison set
or entity, which occurs as the object of a preposition, as in (120) and (121).
(120) Rudi a-kowad-an bi' Deni.
Rudi AV-strong-AN with Deni
‘Rudi is stronger than Deni.’
(121) Dini a-senneng-ngan katembang Lukfi.
Lukfi
Dini AV-happy-AN than
‘Dini is happier than Lukfi.’
There are a number of prepositional elements that marked the object of comparison, including ban and bi' which both mean ‘with’, dhari ‘from’, katembang or
simply tembang, and banding. Tembang and banding are verbal roots that mean
‘compare’, and katembang is the abilitive form of tembang. As discussed in
Chapter 7 section 2, there are a number of inflected verbal forms that take the
role of prepositions in Madurese. They are likely best considered prepositional
or preposition-like words as the order of the element and the object is fixed,
whereas clausal elements usually allow for more fluid word order. Some speakers show a marked preference for the subject to follow the verb in comparative
clauses, as in (122) and (123).
(122) A-kowad-an Rudi banding Deni.
AV-strong-AN Rudi than
Deni
‘Rudi is stronger than Deni.’
(123) A-sennengng-an Dini katembang Lukfi.
AV-happy-AN
Dini than
Lukfi
‘Dini is happier than Lukfi.’
For many speakers, the a- prefix can be omitted with no degradation in grammaticality.","[181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187]"
"360 Chapter 11 Complex sentences
(106) a. Soleha enga'

Soleha remember to name-DEF teacher-DEF
‘Soleha remembered her teacher’s name.’
b. Soleha ng-enga'-e
nyama-na guru-na.
Soleha AV-remember-LOC name-DEF teacher-DEF
‘Soleha remembered her teacher’s name.’
Similarly, (107), in which Nabun is object of the preposition bab ‘about’, is
synonymous with (104b).
(107) Ina a-bala bab Nabun ka Ebu' ja' a-berri' konce juwa
Ina AV-say about Nabun to mother COMP AV-give key that
dha' Sa'diyah.
to Sa'diyah
‘Ina said about Nabun to Mother that she gave the key to Sa'diyah.’
In (107), bab Nabun ‘about Nabun’ is the subject matter argument of bala ‘say’.
Thus, the relationship of (107) and (104b) parallels that of (108a) and (108b)
(discussed in Chapter 10 section 2.2).
(108) a. Ita a-bala bab Lukman ka Soleha.
Ita AV-say about Lukman to Soleha
‘Ita talked about Lukman with Soleha.’
b. Ita a-bala'-agi Lukman ka Soleha.
Ita AV-say-AGI Lukman to Soleha
‘Ita talked about Lukman with Soleha.’
In (108b), the subject matter argument Lukman occurs as a core argument and
the verb takes the -agi suffix. The -agi suffix in (104b) indicates the same about
the subject matter argument Nabun.
The fact that the additional argument in these structures can occur as a
prepositional argument highlights the parallel with the English prolepsis structure. But even when the argument is a bare NP core argument, the suffixal morphology indicates the same relationship. Although kera ‘think’ in (102b) has no
suffix, the matrix dependent Ina can occur as a prepositional object, as in (109).
(109) Siti ngera
parkara Ina ja’ mangkat ka Jakarta are Kemmes.

Siti AV.think about Ina COMP leave
‘Siti thinks about Ina that she left for Jakarta on Thursday.’Prolepsis 361The verb kera is is exceptional with respect to the lack of suffixal morphology.
The pairs of sentences in (110) and (111) illustrate further examples of the -e
and
-agi suffixes on matrix predicates in prolepsis structures. The prolepsis sentences are given in the object voice, reflecting the preference of speakers with
respect to these structures.

door-DEF OV-promise-AGI Ali to Siti COMP already OV-CS-good-IRR
are Sennen.
day Monday
‘Ali promised Siti about the door that it would be fixed by Monday.’
Also pointing to the prolepsis analysis of the Madurese sentences is the fact that
the basic structure (those sentences in which the argument is only a dependent
of the embedded clause) and the prolepsis structure are not entirely synonymous. That is, the pairs of sentences in (102-104) and (110-111), have subtly
different interpretations. This is illustrated with a further example in (112).
(112) a. Ita a-bukte-yagi ja' Hasan ngeco' sapedha motor.
Ita AV-prove- AGI COMP Hasan AV.steal motorcycle
‘Ita proved that Hasan stole the motorcycle.’
b. Ita a-bukte-yagi Hasan ja'
ngeco' sapedha motor.
Ita AV-prove-AGI Hasan COMP AV.steal motorcycle
‘Ita proved Hasan stole the motorcycle.’362 Chapter 11 Complex sentences
Speakers report that although the same basic state of affairs is presented in the
pair in (112), in (112a) Ita is proving that a certain event took place, but in
(112b) she is proving some fact about Hasan, and thus is attributing something
to Hasan. Similarly, in (110a), the sentence asserts that Ita did not know a particular fact, while (110b) asserts that Ita did not know something about Ali, in
particular the fact that he gave money to Amir. These different interpretations
parallel the facts of the pair of English sentences in (113).
(113) a. Many thought that Kate had been selected as Daughter of theYear.
b. Many thought about Kate that she had been selected as Daughter of
the Year.
This lack of synonymy does not occur between basic and raising structures in
English.
(114) a. Many believe that Kate had been selected as Daughter of the Year.
b. Many believe Kate to have been selected as Daughter of the Year.
The facts described thus far are consistent with an analysis in which the
argument shared between the matrix and embedded clauses occurs in both
clauses. The fact that an overt pronoun in the complement clause is possible
supports such an analysis.
(115) Ina a-bala'-agi Nabun ka Ebu'
ja' aba'eng a-berri' konce juwa
AV-give key that
Ina AV-say-AGI Nabun to mother COMP she
dha' Sa'diyah.
to Sa'diyah
‘Ina said about Nabun to Mother that she gave the key to Sa'diyah.’
The complement clause in (115) includes a pronominal subject aba'eng ‘she’
which obligatorily refers to Nabun, a matrix dependent. The sentence in (115) is
completely synonymous with (104b), which contains no overt pronoun in the
complement. Inasmuch as null pronouns are quite common in Madurese, especially in subject position, it is plausible that there is a null pronoun in (104b),
again coreferential with the matrix dependent Nabun, and that (99b) is more
faithfully represented as in (116), where pro represents a null pronoun that is
coindexed with Nabun.
ja'
proi a-berri' konce juwa
(116) Ina a-bala'-agi Nabuni ka Ebu'
AV-give key that
Ina AV-say-AGI Nabun to mother COMP
dha' Sa'diyah.
to Sa'diyah
‘Ina said about Nabun to Mother that she gave the key to Sa'diyah.’Prolepsis 363Overt pronouns are also acceptable in the embedded clauses in other examples.
There is a preference for the overt pronoun not to be too close to its antecedent,
so the most acceptable sentences are those with matrix object voice. (117) is
synonymous with (110b), and (118) synonymous with (98b).

(118) Ina e-kera (bi') Siti ja' mangkat ka Jakarta are Kemmes.

‘Siti thinks that Ina left for Jakarta on Thursday.’
It is notable that the matrix NP need not be a subject in the embedded
clause. In (119), Hasan is the agent of the embedded clause, and would be expected to occur postverbally. In (120) Hasan is the possessor of the object of
the embedded clause, ana’ ‘child’, and in (121) Hasan is the possessor of the
subject of the embedded clause. In each case, a null pronoun occupies the expected location of the NP although an overt pronoun is also possible.

In the case of the direct object (122), the overt pronoun is preferred by most
speakers, and, in the case of the prepositional object (123), the pronoun must be
overt.
The last feature of note is the interpretation of idioms in the prolepsis
structure. A classic argument for raising has been the fact that chunks of idioms
can retain their idiomatic interpretation, even when raised (e.g., Postal 1974).
Thus, in (124), the cat can retain the idiomatic meaning of ‘secret’ that it has in
the construction the cat is out of the bag (124a), even when it is the matrix
clause subject (124b) or object (124c).
(124) a. It seems that the cat is out of the bag.
b. The cat seems to be out of the bag.
c. We expect the cat to be out of the bag well before the date of the party.
In the Madurese construction, idiomatic meaning is not available. First,
consider the sentence in (125), which has both an idiomatic and literal interpretation.
(125) Nase' la
daddi tajjin.
rice already become porridge
‘It is too late to do anything about it.’
lit. ‘The rice has become porridge.’
When wholly contained in a complement clause, this string can be interpreted
idiomatically.
(126) Siti ngera
bari'
ja' nase' la
daddi tajjin.
Siti AV.think yesterday COMP rice already become porridge
‘Siti thought yesterday that it is too late to do anything about it.’
lit. ‘Siti thought yesterday that the rice had become porridge.’
However, when nase’ ‘rice’ appears in the matrix clause, only the literal interpretation is possible.
(127) Siti ngera nase' bari'
ja' la
daddi tajjin.
Siti AV.think rice yesterday COMP already become porridge
‘Siti thought about the rice yesterday that it had become porridge.’Relative clauses 365In (127), nase' precedes both the matrix adverbial bari' ‘yesterday’ and the
complementizer ja', so it is a constituent of the matrix clause. The sentence in
(127) does not allow the idiomatic reading but admits only the literal interpretation. The same effect is seen in the sentences in (128), this time with the idiom
ajam atellor e berras ‘She or he has it easy’ (lit. ‘A chicken laid an egg in the
rice’).
(128) a. Siti namto-wagi
ja' ajam a-tellor
e berras.
Siti AV.certain-AGI COMP chicken AV-lay.egg at rice
‘Siti is certain that he or she has it easy.’
lit. ‘Siti is certain that the chicken laid an egg in the rice.’
b. Siti namto-wagi
ajam
ja'
a-tellor
e berras.
Siti AV.certain-AGI chicken COMP AV-lay.egg at rice
‘Siti is certain about the chicken that it laid an egg in the rice.’
Idiom chunks in this structure operate not as they would a raising analysis, but as idioms operate in the English proleptic object construction. Note that
idiomatic interpretations are not possible in either (129b) or (130b), which is
pragmatically odd.
(129) a. Kelsey believed that the cat would be out of the bag by now.
b. Kelsey believed about the cat that it would be out of the bag.
(130) a. Ashley predicted that the fur would fly at the next committee meeting.
b. #Ashley predicted about the fur that it would fly at the next committee
meeting.
All considered, although raising should not be completely ruled out for
the language, the Madurese construction has the characteristics more typically
found in a prolepsis structure and not a raising structure.
7. Relative clauses
The primary relative clause structure in Madurese consists of the relative particle se followed by a clause with a gap corresponding to the role of the head
noun in the modifying clause. In basic structure, relative clauses follow the
heads they modify, with the exception of headless relative clauses (which can
be viewed as relative clauses with null pronominal heads). The basic structure is
illustrated by the relative clauses in (131) and (132).","[376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382]"
"Numbers 201(86) a. Tello na-kana' berka' ka toko.
three RED-child run to store
‘Three children ran to the store.’
b. Na-kana' ta-tello' berka' ka toko.
RED-child RED-three run
to store
‘Three children ran to the store.’
(87) a. Guru-na a-berri' bolpen dha' pettong mored.
to seven student
teacher AV-give pen
‘The teacher gave pens to seven students.’
b. Guru-na a-berri' bolpen dha' mored pa-petto'.
to student RED-seven
teacher AV-give pen
‘The teacher gave pens to seven students.’
The pairs of sentences in (86) and (87) are fully synonymous. In the a-variants,
the numeral precedes the quantified noun, and in the b-variants, the reduplicated
form of the numeral follows the quantified noun. Speakers report that the reduplicated form is principally used in the Eastern dialect area, although all speakers
deem it fully acceptable.
The prefix ka- with the quantifying number indicates that the members of
the set included in the quantification are considered a coherent group, treated as
though a single entity. This is illustrated in (88) and (89).
(88) a. Mored-da maca ka-tello buku.
student-DEF AV.read KA-three book
‘The student read all three/the three books.’
b. Mored-da maca buku ka-tello'.
student-DEF AV.read book KA-three
‘The student read all three/the three books.’
(89) a. Pa' Karim a-berri’ pesse dha' na'-kana' ka-dhuwa'.
Mr Karim AV-give money to RED-child KA-two
‘Pak Karim gave money to both boys.’
b. Ka-dhuwa na'-kana' e-berri' Pa' Karim pesse.
KA-two
RED-child OV-give Mr Karim money
‘Pak Karim gave both kids money.’
The collective meaning can also be expressed by suffixing -an to the number, as
in (90) and (91), which adds the notion that the group exhausts the set of possi-202 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases
ble members. In this construction, the numeral obligatorily follows the quantified noun.
(90) Na'-kana', tello'-an berka’.
RED-child three-AN run
‘All three children ran.’
(91) Mored dhuwa'-an e-berri' buku ban guru.
OV-give book by teacher
student two-AN
‘Both students were given books by the teacher.’
Combining reduplication with the -an suffix also results in a collective, exhaustive interpretation.
(92) Mored maca
buku la-lema'-an.
student AV. read book RED-five-AN
‘All five students read the book.’
(93) Dayat maca buku la-lema'-an.
Dayat AV. read book RED-five-AN
‘Dayat read the five books.’
In this instance the resulting number acts much like an adverbial quantifying
over the whole action. As (92) shows, the most natural interpretation is that five
students are doing the reading. In (93), it is that there are five books. Both instances require five acts of reading.
The same construction is possible with the structure ka-Num-an. As the
following examples show, it is not necessary for the quantified noun to occur
next to the quantificational adverb, but the adverb is interpreted as indicating a
plural agent/actor. The structure in (94) is more characteristic of the Eastern
dialect and is not widely accepted in the Western dialect.
(94) a. Ka-tello'-an sengko', Sinap ban Marlena maca sorat rowa.
KA-three-AN I
Sinap and Marlena AV.read letter that
‘Sinap, Marlena and I all three read that letter together.’
b. Ka-tello’-an sorat rowa e-baca sengko’, Sinap ban Marlena.
KA-three-AN letter that OV-read I
Sinap and Marlena
‘Sinap, Marlena and I all three read that letter together.’
(95) Sengko' ngakan juko' ajam ka-dhuwa'-an ban Amie.
AV.eat fish chicken KA-two-AN
with Amie
I
‘I ate chicken together with Amie.’Numbers 203In another, related structure, the number phrase is used as a secondary predicate,
taking the object voice prefix e-, the prefix ka-, and the ‘locative’ suffix -e,
schematically e-ka-Num-e. This collocation again indicates the number of entities involved in the activity, but this time does not commit the speaker to the
proposition that they acted together as a group. Thus, alongside (95), there is the
sentence in (96).
(96) Sengko' ngakan ajam e-ka-dhuwa-i ban Amie.
AV.eat chicken OV-KA-two-E with Amie
I
‘Amie and I both ate the chicken.’
In (96), there is no requirement that Amie and I ate together–only that we both
ate chicken. The lack of a requirement that there be collective action is highlighted in the following.
(97) Sarwo ban engko' maca buku e-ka-dhuwa-i/ka-dhuwa'-an. Sarwo
AV.read book OV-KA-two-E/KA-two-AN
Sarwo
Sarwo and I
maca bab
settong sampe' tello', engko' bab
empa' sampe' ennem.
AV.read chapter one
until three I
chapter four until six
‘Sarwo and I both read the same book. Sarwo read chapters one through
three and I read chapters four through six.’
While ekadhuwai and kadhuwa'an are both perfectly grammatical, the interpretation is different. With ekadhuwai the notion is that Sarwo and I acted independently; we may or may not have cooperated in dividing the task of reading
the book. With kadhuwa'an, Sarwo and I are most likely acting cooperatively,
perhaps dividing the task of reading. The example in (98), where tello' is the
base, indicates that this structure is generalized to other numbers and is not
unique to dhuwa' ‘two’.
(98) Sengko' entar ka Malang e-ka-tello-we bi' Toni ban Lukman.
I
go to Malang OV-KA-three-E with Toni and Lukman
‘Toni, Lukman, and I all three went to Malang.’
Partitives are indicated in a number of different ways, largely subject to
speaker variation. One manner is to use the ka- prefix together with some other
specification of the set of entities being described. This is illustrated in (99100).
(99) Mored ka-dhuwa jiya badha e kellas sateya.
student KA-two this exist at class now
‘Two of these students are in class today.’204 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases
(100) Na'-kana' bine’ ka-lema rowa maca buku.
RED-child female KA-five that AV.read book
‘Five of those girls read the book.’
In both (99) and (100), the implication is that there are more students or girls in
the sets under consideration than the number for whom the state of affairs is
predicated. But in each case the set is delimited by a demonstrative, jiya ‘this’
or rowa ‘that’. The set may also be delimited by a possessor (101).
(101) a. Ka-tello', mored-da Pa' Hadi ta' lulus tes.
KA-three student-DEF Mr Hadi not pass test
‘Three of Pak Hadi’s students did not pass the test.’
b. Mored-da Pa' Hadi se ka-tello' ta' lulus tes.
student-DEF Mr Hadi REL KA-three not pass test
‘Three of Pak Hadi’s students did not pass the test.’
In (101a), the possessor Pa' Hadi limits the set of students being considered. In
(101b), the numeral occurs as a predicate in the relative clause se katello'.
Partitives may be indicated prepositionally as well.
(102) Tello dhari mored-da Pa' Hadi ta' lulus tes.
three from student-DEF Mr Hadi not pass test
‘Three of Pak Hadi’s students did not pass the test.’
(103) Dhuwa dhari/antara-na na'-kana' entar-a dha' upcara.
two
from/between-DEF RED-child go-IRR to ceremony
‘Two of the children will go to the ceremony.’
Speakers use the preposition dhari ‘from’ or the prepositional antarana ‘between’ in the complement of the number.
Finally, the number may be modified by a degree adverb such as coma
‘only’ (104) or para' ‘only’ (105). In each case the degree modifier is placed
immediately before the number.
(104) Coma dhuwa na'-kana' entar dha' sakola'-an.
RED-child go
to school-NOM
only two
‘Only two children went to school.’
(105) Para’ pa-petto' mored-da Pa' Hadi bakal lulus tes.
only RED-seven student-DEF Mr Hadi will pass test
‘Only seven of Pak Hadi’s students will pass the test.’Measure phrases 205Ordinal numbers are formed in one of two ways. One is to use kapeng,which marks ordinality, before the cardinal number, as in kapeng settong
‘first’, kapeng dhuwa ‘second’, and so on. This is illustrated in (106).
(106) Pangeran Cakranengrat kapeng dhuwa' jiya laen
moso kai-na.
this different with father-DEF
Pangeran Cakranengrat ORD two
‘Pangeran Cakranengrat II was different from his father.’
The other means of indicating ordinality is with a relative clause with the number taking the prefix ka- as predicate, as se kasettong ‘first’, se kadhuwa'
‘second’, and so on. This is illustrated in (107).
(107) Sengko' maca buku se kadhuwa'.
AV.read book REL KA.two
I
‘I read the second book.’
8. Measure phrases
Many noncount nouns require some unit of measurement in order to be discretely quantified or enumerated, in a way quite familiar from other languages. Thus
particular nouns require particular types of measure expressions, as in (108110).
(108) Sengko' parlo lema liter bensin.
I
need five liter gasoline
‘I need five liters of gasoline.’
(109) Dayat ma-tadha'
tello pereng nase' guring.
Dayat AV.CS-not.exist three plate rice fry
‘Dayat ate three plates of fried rice.’
(110) Karim la
ngenom dhu cangker kopi.
coffee
Karim already AV-drink two cup
‘Karim drank two cups of coffee.’
The mass nouns bensin ‘gasoline’, nase' ‘rice’, and kopi ‘coffee’ require appropriate units of measure such as liter ‘liter’, pereng ‘plate’, and cangker ‘cup’ in
order to be numerically quantified. In these examples the number and the unit of
measure form a constituent that precedes the quantified noun. The measure
phrase can also immediately follow the noun it quantifies, as in (111-113), fully
synonymous counterparts of the sentences in (108-110).","[217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222]"
"Prepositions in other environments 247There is a variety of other verbs which take prepositional rather than bare
objects, a few of which include: campor moso ‘mix with’, congngo dha' ‘visit’,
pabine'e moso ‘be married with’, tabang dha' ‘chase’ and others.
4.2. Prepositional marking of direct objects
Under certain conditions, direct objects, which usually occur as unmarked NPs,
occur in PPs headed by dha'/ka ‘to’. Although nominalizations with overt direct
objects are relatively rare, when they occur, the object takes the preposition.
(118) Pa-mokol-la
Jatim ka kaju sala.
NOM-AV.hit-DEF Jatim to wood wrong
‘Jatim’s hitting the wood was poorly executed.’
(119) Pa-ngekke'-na
burus ka Hosen kellet.
NOM-AV.bite-DEF dog to Hosen deep
‘The dog’s biting of Hosen was deep.’
(120) Kekke'-an-na burus ka Hosen sara.
bite-NOM-DEF dog to Hosen bad
‘The dog’s biting of Hosen was bad.’
In the process nominal in (118), pamokolla Jatim ka pettah ‘Jatim’s hitting the
bricks’, the object of pokol ‘hit’, pettah ‘brick’, which is normally a bare NP, is
the object of the preposition ka. Likewise, in the result nominal in (120),
keke'anna burus ka Hosen ‘the dog’s biting of Hosen’, the object Hosen occurs
as the object of ka.
Another environment in which a direct object can occur in a PP with
dha'/ka as the head is when the object is split from its verb by the adverbial keya
‘too’. This is illustrated in the pairs in (121) and (122).
(121) a. Rokip nenggu kanca-na keya.
Rokip AV.see friend-DEF too
‘Rokip visited her friends, too.’
b. Rokip nenggu keya dha' kanca-na.
Rokip AV.see too to friend-DEF
‘Rokip visited her friends, too.’
(122) a. Adi nambu'
Ari bi' bato keya.
Adi AV.throw.at Ari with rock too
‘Adi hit Ari with a rock too.’248Chapter 8 Prepositions and PPsb. Adi nambu'
keya dha' Ari bi' bato.
Adi AV.throw.at too to Ari with rock
‘Adi hit Ari with a rock too.’
In the a-sentences, the direct objects kancana ‘her friends’ and Ari occur as
plain NPs immediately following the verb. In the b-sentences, where keya ‘too’
intervenes between verb and object, the object occurs with the preposition dha'.
While many speakers accept both variants of such sentences, others do not,
judging the b-sentences unacceptable.
More marginal than the case above, for some speakers direct objects can
optionally be PP objects when the direct object of the clause represents one of a
group of potential entities affected, as in (123) and (124).
(123) %Alwi mokol dha' Amir.
Alwi AV.hit to Amir
‘Alwi hit Amir (out of a group of possible people).’
(124) %Lukman maca dha' buku jiya.
Lukman AV.read to book this
‘Lukman read this book (instead of some other he might have).’
(123) and (124) differ minimally from structures in which the object is a bare
NP, Alwi mokol Amir ‘Alwi hit Amir’ and Lukman maca buku jiya ‘Lukman
read this book’, only asserting that there was a possible set of potential entities
but these were the ones chosen. Again, this is structure is considered marginal
by some and completely ungrammatical by many.
The direct object is also marked by ka or dha' with transitive active involitives, as in (125) and (126), the latter of which is taken from Stevens
1968:133.
(125) Alwi ta-pokol ka/dha' Amir.

Amir
Alwi IN-hit
‘Alwi accidentally hit Amir.’
(126) Sengko' ta-ng-abas dha' Paman.

‘I accidentally saw Uncle.’Chapter 9
Verb phrases and verbal markingThis chapter focuses on the structure of the verb phrase and the inflectional
morphology associated with verbal predicates. While most, if not all, of these
features have been evident in illustrative examples in previous chapters, none
has been examined in much detail. In addition to the verbal voice system detailed in section 1, manners of indicating mood and aspect are examined in sections 2-4, negation in section 5, and adversative, involitive, and abilitive VPs in
section 6.
1. Voice
Far and away the most striking and unique feature of Western Austronesian
languages is the morphological means for identifying on the verb the most
prominent argument in a clause. In looking at Tagalog, Starosta (1986) refers to
this as the ‘perpetual centre of the sentence’. This is illustrated in (1a,b). Each
sentence makes use of the same verbal predicate and the same arguments, and
the clauses are propositionally equivalent; however, (1a) has the agent precede
the verb, which takes a nasal prefix, and (1b) has the object precede the verb,
which takes the prefix e-.
(1) a. Ale'
noro'
Ebu.
yngr.sibling AV.follow mother
‘Little Brother followed Mother.’
b. Ebu
e-toro'
Ale'.
mother OV-follow yngr.sibling
‘Little Brother followed mother./Mother was followed by Little Brother.’
In (1a), the ‘perceptual centre’ is Ale' ‘Little Brother’ and in (1b) it is Ebu
‘mother’. This element has been alternately referred to as the subject, the topic,
the focus, and the ‘trigger’ in various accounts of closely related languages.
Here the term ‘subject’ will be employed as in many ways it is the most generally used and theory-neutral term that can be applied.
Formosan languages, Philippine languages, and Malagasy are widely
recognized as having rich voice systems in which as many as 6 voices are posited, each with it identifying morphology. Generally only two distinct voices
are posited for Indonesian languages, including Madurese, based largely on the250Chapter 9 VPs and verbal markinganalysis of syntactically transitive verbs. One voice has been referred to in the
literature as active, actor voice, actor focus, actor trigger and others. This voice
is indicated by the morphology associated with verbs in canonical transitive
clauses in which the agent is the subject, as in (1a). In opposition stands the
passive, object voice, object focus, object trigger, and others indicated by the
morphology associated with the same set of verbs in clauses in which an argument other than the agent is subject, as in (1b).
These pairs, illustrated again in (2), on the surface strongly resemble the
active/passive opposition found in Western languages and many other languages of the world. (Specifically, the basic word order found in these clauses is
identical to that in English.)
(2) a. Bibbi' nenggu na'-kana'.
aunt AV.watch RED-child
‘Auntie watched the children.’
b. Na'-kana' e-tenggu Bibbi'.
RED-child OV-watch aunt
‘Auntie watched the children./The children were watched by Auntie.’
1.1. Actor voice
The morphology associated with canonical transitive verbs with agentive subjects is referred to as ‘actor voice’. This morphology takes two forms: (1) the
nasal prefix ng- and its phonologically-conditioned variants, which it shares
with Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, and other Indonesian languages; and (2)
the prefix a-, which is unique to Madurese.
The nasal prefix is used with a large number of predicates. A very limited
list is given in (3).

What is more, ngladine is an alternate form of the more common form aladine 'serve',
which takes the a- actor voice prefix discussed presently. Most of the few instances of
ng-l are less common variants of forms with the a- prefix.","[263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"

ra'-sakerra' ‘one piece each’The causative prefix pa- (shown in actor voice form ma- here) displays some
flexibility regarding its position with respect to the reduplicated syllable.
(15) palabu ‘make fall’
pasossa ‘make sad’
paenom ‘make drink’bu-palabu
sa-pasossa
nom-paenompabu-labu ‘make fall (PL)’
pasa-sossa ‘made sad (PL)’
panom-enom ‘make drink (PL)'Both forms in each set can be used as reduplicated causative forms. However,
the forms in the middle column have an additional specialized meaning of
roughly ‘pretend to X’ (see section 3.1.3). Causatives, including these forms,
are treated in Chapter 10, section 6. Additionally, clitics such as the negative
ta'/lo' can follow the causative morpheme, and the reduplicated syllable can
precede both.
(16) pata'sake' ‘not make sick’
pata'lesso ‘not make tired’ke'-pata'sake' ‘not make sick (PL)’
so-pata'lesso ‘not make tired (PL)’Finally, the object voice can combine with the ka- morpheme and the causative.
In both cases, the various morphemes occur in their expected positions: kamust follow the reduplicant, pa- may either follow or precede the reduplicant,
and e- must take the outermost position.
(17) kapeggel ‘become angry’ egel-kapeggel ‘be made angry (PL)’
katako' ‘become afraid’ eko'-katako' ‘become afraid (PL)’
palabu ‘make fall’
ebu-palabu epabu-labu ‘be made to fall (PL)’
pasossa ‘make sad’
esa-pasossa epasa-sossa ‘be made sad (PL)’
Total reduplication is less common than final-syllable reduplication. Generally speaking, whole-word reduplication is associated with nouns, and the
affixes associated with derived nouns are included in the scope of reduplication.
(18) massa' ‘cook’
raja ‘king’
junel ‘skilled’
jalan ‘road’massa'an ‘food/dish’
karaja'an ‘kingdom’
kajunelan ‘expertise’
pajalanan ‘pedestrian’massa'an-massa'an ‘dishes’
karaja'an-karaja'an ‘kingdoms’
kajunelan-kajunelan ‘expertises’
pajalanan-pajalanan
‘pedestrians’136 Chapter 5 Reduplication
tane ‘farm’
toddu' ‘point’
jaga ‘guard’patane ‘farmer’
panoddu' ‘pointer’
panjaga ‘guard’patane-patane ‘farmers’
panoddu'-panoddu' ‘pointers’
panjaga-panjaga ‘guards’When used with verbs that must be marked for voice, the voice morpheme generally precedes the reduplicant, and only the root is reduplicated. The
lone exception to this is the nasal actor voice morpheme. In this case both the
base and the reduplicant are inflected for actor voice.
(19) toles ‘write’
pokol ‘hit’
baca ‘read’
kerem ‘send’noles-noles ‘write (PL)’
mokol-mokol ‘hit (PL)’
maca-maca ‘read (PL)’
ngerem-ngerem ‘send (PL)’When the a- form is used, the base is reduplicated and the actor voice morpheme occurs in word-initial position.
(20) berri' ‘give’
lonca’ ‘jump’
berka' ‘run’
jelling ‘watch’aberri'-berri' ‘give (PL)’
alonca'-lonca' ‘jump (PL)’
aberka'-berka' ‘run (PL)’
ajelling-jelling ‘watch (PL)’Likewise, in object voice, the base is reduplicated and the actor voice
morpheme occurs in word-initial position.
(21) epokol-pokol ‘be hit (PL)’
ekerem-kerem ‘be sent (PL)’
eberri'-berri' ‘be given (PL)’
ejelling-jelling ‘be watched (PL)’
The same is true of all the verbal prefixes, including the causative prefix pa-,
which showed flexibility of position in cases of final-syllable reduplication.
(22) a. tatapokol-pokol ‘get hit accidentally (PL)’
takerem-kerem ‘get sent accidentally (PL)’
tamole-mole ‘return home accidentally (PL)
b.kakasenneng-senneng ‘become happy (PL)’
karaja-raja ‘become large (PL)’
kasake'-sake' ‘become ill (PL)’Functions of reduplication 137c. papasenneng-senneng ‘make happy (PL)’
papote-pote ‘make white (PL)’
palabu-labu ‘cause to fall (PL)’
As is the case with final-syllable reduplication, verbal suffixes are never
reduplicated in whole-word reduplication. Thus in (20), only the second instantiation of the reduplicated material, the root, carries a suffix (which is in boldface).1
(23) ngennallagi ‘introduce’
amassa'agi ‘cook for’
ngereme ‘send to’
mokole ‘hit repeatedly’
ajaran ‘study often’
aberka'an ‘run often’ngennal-ngennallagi ‘introduce (PL)’
amassa'-massa'agi ‘cook for (PL)’
ngerem-ngereme ‘send to (PL)’
mokol-mokole ‘hit repeatendly (PL)’
ajar-ajaran ‘study often (PL)’
aberka'-berka'an ‘run often (PL)’Only prefixes and circumfixes are of potential interest with respect to
Ca/initial-syllable reduplication. In each case, the reduplicated syllable follows
the prefix. The reduplicant is bolded in (24).
(24) tolong ‘help’
buruk ‘advise’
lenggi ‘sit’
buruk ‘advise’ata-tolong ‘help (PL)’
aba-buruk ‘advise (PL)’
ela-lenggi'i ‘be sat on (PL)’
ebu-buruk ‘be advised (PL)’It should be noted that lenggi ‘sit’ is from a higher speech level and is transitivized with the locative suffix -e (realized here as [i]), which makes it eligible for
the object voice morphology that occurs word initially.
3. Functions of reduplication
Reduplication is used in the majority of cases to signal plurality. This can be
plurality of actions, plurality of entities, plurality of effect, either directly or by
metaphorical extension. This is familiar from other languages, and many of the
specific grammatical functions and meanings have been noted for reduplication
in other languages. However, not all instances of reduplication have any obvious connection to plurality, as in the case of denoting imitation or toy objects
1Note that the a in aberka'an ‘run often’ is the actor voice prefix and so occurs only in
the first instance of the root, whereas the initial a in ajaran ‘study often’ is part of the
root ajar and thus is present on the root and the copy.","[151, 152, 153, 154]"

"182 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases
They are surveyed here.
2.1. Nominal inflection
Other than perhaps the definite morpheme -na, which has an uncertain morphological status, reduplication is the only productive inflection of noun stems. As
noted in Chapter 5 section 3.2, reduplication of a noun stem without any additional morphology indicates plurality, as in the examples in (3).
(3)korse ‘chair’
kothak ‘box’
koceng ‘cat’
sape ‘cow’se-korse ‘chairs’
thak-kothak ‘boxes’
ceng-koceng ‘cats’
se-sape ‘cows’The b-sentences in (4) and (5) illustrate.
(4) a. Koceng rowa ngeco' juko'.
cat
that AV.steal fish
‘That cat stole some fish.’
b. Ceng-koceng rowa ngeco' juko'.
RED-cat
that AV.steal fish
‘Those cats stole some fish.’
(5) a. Geddhang jiya kodu e-massa' gallu.
banana
this should OV-cook before
‘This banana should be cooked first (before being eaten).’
b. Dhang-geddhang jiya kodu e-massa' gallu.
RED-banana
this should OV-cook before
‘These bananas should be cooked first (before being eaten).’
Reduplication of the noun is not the sole means for denoting more than one
entity. Aside from the use of quantifiers and numerals, which is discussed in
sections 6 and 7, there are two options for indicating plurality in the noun
phrase. First, if there is an adjective modifying the noun, preferably in a relative
clause, reduplication of the adjective can denote that the noun is plural, as in (6)
and (7).
(6)Koceng (se) ros-koros rowa ngeco' juko'.
REL RED-thin that AV.steal fish
cat
‘Those skinny cats stole some fish.’Nominal morphology 183(7)Geddhang (se) re-mera jiya kodu e-massa' gallu.
REL RED-red this should OV-cook before
banana
‘These red bananas should be cooked first (before being eaten).’Finally, plurality need not be expressed grammatically at all. The a-sentences in
(4) and (5) may be translated ‘Those cats stole some fish’ and ‘These bananas
should be cooked first’ simply by virtue of the discourse context. If it is clear
from the speech situation that plural entities are the speaker’s intent, the speaker
need not indicate that overtly. This would hold for (6) and (7) as well. If the
adjectives in (6) and (7) were not reduplicated, the NPs would be interpreted as
singular or plural depending on the discourse context.
The only other instances of plurality marked directly on a noun are the
exceptional cases of the interrogatives sapa'an and apa'an, plural counterparts
of sapa ‘who’ and apa ‘what’, as in (8) and (9).
(8)Sapa'an se la
mangkat dha' Sorbaja?
to Surabaya
who.PL REL already leave
‘Who have left for Surabaya?’(9)Apa'an se e-belli Romlah?
what.PL REL OV-buy Romlah
‘What did Romlah buy?’The use of sapa'an and apa'an indicates that the speaker expects a plural answer. The structure and range of interrogatives is discussed in Chapter 14.
2.2. Nominal derivation

3. Pronouns
Pronominal forms can constitute an NP or the head of an NP. The familiar
speech level has a limited set of pronouns (see Chapter 3 section 2.4). First,
second, and third person are distinguished, although the second and third persons are derived forms.","[198, 199, 200, 201]"
"78 Chapter 3 Lexical categories
2. Closed class categories
2.1. Adverbs: straddling the open/closed dichotomy
Adverb straddles the line between open and closed lexical classes. Many elements that modify the clause, verb phrase or adjective are derived forms, largely
with adjectival roots. Nonetheless, there are a number of forms which serve
exclusively as adverbs and are equipped with no derivational morphology. Although most, if not all, manner adverbs are derived, there are temporal, epistemic, frequency, and degree adverbs that are not.
(45) Temporal adverbs
sateya
‘now’
buru
‘recently’
laju
‘next/right away’
dhaggi'
‘later/in the future’
gella'
‘recently/before’
na'an
‘soon’
gi'
‘still’
paggun
‘still’
(46) Epistemic adverbs
ara, ngara
‘maybe’
dadak
‘suddenly’
megga'
‘possibly’
pola
‘probably’
(47) Frequency adverbs
dhangkhadang ‘sometimes’
poampo
‘sometimes’
rangrang
‘rarely’
seggut
‘often’
(48) Degree adverbs
banget
‘very’
ce'
‘very’
coma
‘only’
gallu
‘too’
keng
‘only’
maggi
‘almost’
neng
‘only’
para'
‘almost’Closed class categories 79Although adverbs can take various positions in the sentence, temporal, epistemic, and frequency adverbs can all occur immediately before the verb, as in the
following.
(49) Satimma buru
dhateng.
Satimma recently come
‘Satimma just came.’
(50) Rokip ban Hadi ara
entar ka Sumatra taon ba'ari'.
Rokip and Hadi perhaps go to Sumatra year yesterday
‘Perhaps Rokip and Hadi went to Sumatra last year.’
(51) Bapa' dhang-khadang a-lumbur.
AV-work.late
father sometimes
‘Father sometimes works late.’
Options for adverb placement and their order in sentences containing
more than one are discussed in detail in Chapter 12. Degree adverbs typically
immediately precede the element that they modify (50), with the exception of
gallu ‘too’, which follows the adjective it modifies.
(52) Soto Madura jiya ce' nyaman-na!
stew Madura this very delicious-DEF
‘This soto Madura is really delicious!’
(53) Kopi reya manes gallu.
coffee this sweet too
‘This coffee is too sweet.’
If one factors in manner adverbials, the claim can be made that the category adverb is an open class category. Manner adverbs can be readily derived
from adjectives either through affixation of -an (54), reduplication (55), a combination of the two (56) or simple conversion (57).
(54) Marlena noles
sorat ka Ita dhuli-yan.
Marlena AV.write letter to Ita quick-AN
‘Marlena wrote the letter to Ita quickly.’
(55) Siti ajar gu-onggu.
Siti study RED-real
‘Siti studies seriously.’80 Chapter 3 Lexical categories
(56) Hasan maca buku on-laon-an.
Hasan AV.read book RED-slow-AN
‘Hasan read the book slowly.’
(57) Sinap nyetir
motor-ra santa'.
Sinap AV.drive car-DEF fast
‘Sinap drives her car fast.’
As these derivations are quite productive, the subcategory of manner adverb
seems to be an open class. However, the fact remains that if manner adverbs are
set aside the category adverb is a small, closed class.
2.2. Auxiliaries
There is a small number of lexical items which act as modal and temporal elements that modify the sentence in a way quite similar to auxiliaries in English.
This is the sole function for these basic words commonly referred to as auxiliaries in the literature, listed in (58).
(58) bakal ‘will’
bisa ‘can’
kodu ‘should’
pasthe ‘must’
The auxiliaries invariantly occur in immediate preverbal position, as in (59) and
(60).
(59) Ebu' bisa maca sorat reya.
mother can AV.read letter this
‘Mother can read this letter.’
(60) Rokip kodu entar dha’ Sorbaja.
Rokip should go to Surabaya
‘Rokip should go to Surabaya.’
The only lexical item that may intercede between these auxiliaries and the verb
is the negative, ta’ or lo’ (61). Preverbal adverbs must precede any auxiliaries
(62).
(61) Rokip kodu lo’ entar dha’ Sorbaja.
Rokip should not go to Surabaya
‘Rokip should not go to Surabaya.’Closed class categories 81(62) a. Bapa' dhang-khadang pasthe a-lumbur.
father sometimes
must AV-work.late
‘Father sometimes has to work late.’
b. *Bapa' pasthe dhang-kadhang a-lumbur.
These elements thus share the property of preceding the sentential negative with
English auxiliaries (61) but differ from English auxiliaries with respect to the
inability of adverbs to intervene between the auxiliary and the main verb of the
sentence (62). There is a larger number of lexical items that serve to modify
sentences in the same way as modal and aspectual auxiliaries and occupy the
same position in a clause. However, this set of auxiliary items include words
that are primarily verbs and adverbs. Auxiliaries and their functions are discussed more fully in Chapter 9 section 4.
2.3. Prepositions
Madurese has a small number of basic prepositions for location, direction, and
comitatives and instruments. Other words and expressions that serve the function of prepositions and combine are derived from other roots, or are words
which are also members of other lexical categories. These lexical items combine
with basic prepositions to denote particular locatives, e.g. e ‘at’ combines with
attas ‘top’ as e attas ‘on/above’ (see Chapter 8 section 3). The basic prepositions are:
(63) neng
e
ka
dha'
dhari
bi'
moso‘at’
‘at’
‘to’
‘to’
‘from’
‘with/by’
‘with/by’Prepositions typically take NP complements; in (64) Jakarta is the complement
of ka and in (65) jaran ‘horse’ is the complement of dhari.
(64) Hasan entar ka Jakarta.
Hasan go to Jakarta
‘Hasan went to Jakarta.’82 Chapter 3 Lexical categories
(65) Aba'na toron dhari jaran.
he/she descend from horse
‘He/she got off the horse.’
2.4. Pronouns
The pronominal system of the familiar speech level includes forms for first,
second, and third persons, some of which are derived forms or at least expressions that serve additional purposes. There is dialectal variation in the inventory
of forms, which I will not attempt to sort out here.1 The basic forms for the
three persons are:
(66) sengko', engko', aba' ‘I’
tang/sang ‘my’
ba'na, ba'en, ba'eng, kake, sedha ‘you’
aba'na, aba'eng, dibi'na, dibi'eng ‘he/she’
Of these, the only truly basic forms are sengko' and tang/sang. The second and
third person forms are comprised of possessed forms of aba' ‘body, soul’ and
dibi' ‘only, sole’. The multiple forms for second and third persons are dialectal
and stylistic variants, the most standard forms being ba'na ‘you’ and aba'na
‘he/she’. Additionally, there are a large number of first and second person forms
that are used in the higher speech levels. The forms are given here, but their use
is detailed in Chapter 15.
(67) 1st person
bula
gula
kaula
(ba)dan kaula
dalem
apdina
apdi dalem
bal-gebbal dalem2nd person
dika
diko
sampeyan
panjennengngan
padana
sampeyan dalem
ajunan dalem
ajunan sampeyan
ajunan panjennengnganPlural forms are quite rare in use, and in fact some speakers are unsure how to
form them. However, there are two strategies for indicating plurality with pronouns. One is the reduplicated form of aba', ba'-aba'. This form is a general
plural pronoun that can be used for all persons; the context in which it occurs
1See Sutoko et al 1998 for dialect information.","[94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"
"The vocabularies 471The kasar and alos vocabularies are far more extensive than is tengnga'an,
which Stevens (1966) estimates consists of about 30 words; this is reflected in
the gaps in the table. Tengnga'an lexical items tend to be deictic words indicating temporal and physical relations, e.g, sanonto ‘now’ and neko ‘this’, but
includes some nouns and verbs as well. The alos and kasar vocabularies include
many more nouns and verbs than tengnga'an. Each lexical item in the alos category has a kasar counterpart. The semantic fields represented by alos words
include first and second person and deictic pronouns, some body parts, some
clothing, some familial relations, some personal items, some actions, temporal
expressions, perception predicates, and other terms. Lexical items which do not
show this kind of variation and are to be used regardless of the speech situation
are referred to in the literature (e.g., Stevens 1966) as biyasa ‘usual’.3 Choice of
lexical items depends on the respective social status of speaker and addressee
and the context of the speech event. These notions are set out more precisely in
the section that follows.
In addition to these vocabularies is a system of honorific vocabulary used
primarily in reference to third persons. Focusing on the person to be honored,
this system includes two sets of lexical items–alos tenggi ‘high refined’ and
alos mandhap ‘low refined’. A sample is given in (3), which also includes the
corresponding biyasa word.

that the alos mandhap set. The reason for the disparity reflects the function of
the vocabulary. The alos tenggi vocabulary includes lexical items that identify
the possessions, body parts, and relatives of an honored person (including, when
3Most Madurese speakers consider the kasar and biyasa vocabularies as comprising a
single, kasar level. Useful or not, the distinction between kasar and biyasa will be recognized when necessary in what follows.","[487, 488]"
"126 Chapter 4 Morphology
(104) a. kamma ‘where’
kamma-n ‘where’ (no change in meaning)
b. barampa ‘how many’ pan-barampa-n ‘several’
c. ella ‘already’
sa-'-ella-na ‘after’ (free variation
with sa-ella-na)
In (104a), the n suffixed to the root kamma ‘where’ results in no change in
meaning and occurs in free variation with the bare root. Conversely, in the reduplicated form pan-barampan ‘several’, the n extension is obligatory and participates in a change in meaning. (104c) provides an example of the glottal stop
extension in sa'ellana ‘after’. In this instance there is change in meaning and the
form occurs in free variation with the form saellana.
The extension n occurs frequently with the use of verbal affixes. For instance, verb roots ending in vowels and taking the locative suffix -e or the irrealis suffix -a frequently occur with the extension, possibly as one means of
avoiding a sequence of two vowels. In the sentence in (105), there are two instances of this.
(105) Pas e-duka-n-e
e-pate-n-a. Makke
pottre-na
la
then OV-angry-n-LOC OV-die-n-IRR even though daughter-DEF already
a-ra-sapora dha' rama-na, rato paggun duka, paggun ng-amok.
AV-RED-sorry to
father-DEF king still
angry still
AV-amok
‘He was angry and was going to kill her. Even though his daughter had
apologized to her father, the king was still angry, still going wild.’
In the first sentence in (105), there are two instances of the extension n, one in
the transitivized object voice form of duka ‘angry’, and the other in the object
voice form for ‘kill’ in the irrealis, which also occurs as epate'a. In these two
instances, the extension occurs between two vowels, so there may be some phonological explanation for their appearance, despite the fact that they are optional.
The free variation also occurs in the case of -n and certain suffixes. Verbal suffixes ending in phonemic /e/ frequently take this extension, e.g. both the
locative and durative -e and the suffix -agi. Again, at times it seems to be phonologically motivated, to break up a V+V sequence. However, it also occurs
with no apparent phonological conditioning. In neither case is there any effect
on meaning. For example, -n occurs with -agi in the sentences in (106) and
(107).
(106) Edhing-agi-n!
hear-AGI-n
‘Listen!’Compounds 127(107) Paremba' Joko Tole se careta e-dungeng-ngagi-n-a sengko'.
Paremba' Joko Tole REL story OV-story-AGI-n-IRR I
‘Paremba’ Joko Tole is the story that I am going to tell.’
In both instances here, the n extension is optional. (106) would be perfectly
grammatical with edhingagi in place of edhingagin and (107) would be with
edungengngagia rather than edungengngagina. There is a higher incidence in
the use of the extension in environments such as in (107), where it serves to
break up a V+V sequence, than in word-final position, where no affix, hence no
vowel, follows.
As argued by Stevens (1968:94), the extension is phonologically a part of
the root, despite the fact that it is often syllabified as part of an adjoining syllable. Evidence for this is the fact that it acts as part of the root in final syllable
reduplication. For example, in the reduplicated form as pan-arampan ‘several’
(104b) the n extension occurs in the reduplicated syllable prefixed to the root. In
addition, the reduplicated form of (104a) kamman includes the extension, as in
(108).
(108) man-kamman ‘everywhere’
Additionally, reduplicated forms for the two examples in (105) are ekandukane, which means ‘to become extremely angry’, and eten-patena a plural
form of ‘will be killed’. In both cases, the n occurs in the reduplicated syllable.
Reduplication is described in detail in Chapter 5.
4. Compounds
Although the majority of compounds used in the language are compound nouns,
there are compound verbs as well. Compound nouns are generally either N-N
compounds or N-V compounds. Some compounds take the full form of the initial N and others use an abbreviated form. Examples of N-N compounds are
given in (109) and N-V compounds in (110).

ReduplicationReduplication, the copying of all or part of a word as an affix to a stem, is a
notable morphological process in Madurese, a characteristic it shares with other
Austronesian languages. Aside from the vowel harmony system described in
Chapter 2 section 4, reduplication is likely the aspect of Madurese grammar
most frequently discussed in the theoretical linguistics literature (Wilbur 1973;
Marantz 1982; Stevens 1985 &1994; Steriade 1988; Silverman 2002).
Madurese exhibits three basic types of reduplication: final-syllable reduplication, whole-word reduplication, and Ca/initial-syllable reduplication. In this
section, each type of reduplication and its interaction with other affixes is exemplified and the meanings denoted by reduplication are detailed.
1. Reduplication types
Far and away the most prevalent reduplication process is final-syllable reduplication. Final-syllable reduplication is also the process of most interest to theoretical linguists as the reduplicated syllable is affixed not to the end of the stem,
as in most cases of final-syllable reduplication, but at the beginning of the stem.
So, for a stem with an open CV final syllable, the reduplication process copies
that CV sequence and affixes it to the left edge of the stem, as in (1).1
(1)buku ‘book’
baca ‘read’
pote ‘white’
bali ‘return’ku-buku ‘books’
ca-baca ‘read (PL)’
te-pote ‘very white’
li-bali ‘return (PL)’The reduplicated forms in (1) and those that follow are given in the conventional orthography, which sets the reduplicated syllable off from the stem to which
it affixes with a hyphen.
Examples of final-syllable reduplication with CVC, VC, V, and CCV(C)
are:
1Although reduplication can result in more than one meaning for a single stem, only one
translation is given for any particular stem in sections 1 and.2. With verb stems, the
translation may contain the designation PL(URAL), indicating multiple occurrences of
the action, either by a single individual or multiple individuals. The meanings and functions of reduplication will be discussed in section 3.","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"

Word stress is not a salient feature of Madurese, and receives little mention in
the literature, e.g. Stevens (1968) mentions it only in passing. As pointed out by
Ogloblin (1986), it is likely that the intonation group is the lowest relevant phonological unit in Madurese (which roughly coincides with what Uhlenbeck
(1975) refers to as the ‘sentence segment’ in Javanese). Words uttered in isolation exhibit stress on almost any syllable in the root; in consecutive repetitions
of single words stress may fall on the first syllable in the first instantiation and
on the second in the next and vice versa. In the chapters that follow, intonation
and its role in the overall syntactic structure and semantic interpretation of a
particular sentence is noted when salient. However, at this point there have been
few investigations into prosody in Madurese, and work in this area remains for
the future.
8. Orthography
A number of writing systems have been used for Madurese over the years. Few
have proven completely satisfactory for representing the variety of sounds in the
language. Some have been more phonemically based but the majority take into
account some of the results of the phonological rules outlined above.
Initially, Madurese was written in the kawi syllabary used to write Javanese. Like a number of the writing systems to follow, the Javanese syllabary
was not entirely satisfactory. Because Madurese contains three series of stops
(voiceless, voiceless aspirated, and voiced) and Javanese contains only two
(voiceless and so-called breathy), the Javanese syllabary does not include a suf-52 Chapter 2 Phonology
ficient number of symbols to represent this three-way contrast. Additionally, the
vowel inventories of the two languages do not match, so the appropriate symbols were not available for every consonant-vowel combination. Most of the
alphabetic systems that followed pretty much suffered from the same lack of
symbols.
An exception is the Roman script alphabet devised by Kiliaan, who used
it in his grammar (1897) and dictionary (1904), based on the system introduced
for Javanese, Indonesian and other languages of Indonesia. This alphabet did
capture the three-way phonation contrast for stops: voiceless stops and voiced
stops were represented by the typical symbols. Aspirated stops were represented
in two-letter sequences of the voiced stop followed by h. So, [p] was
represented as bh, [] as dh, and so on. The retroflex stops were distinguished
from the dental stops as is customary in many phonetic transcriptions schemes,
using a diacritic below the stop symbol; so, [ṭ], [ṭ], and [ḍ] were represented as
ṭ, ḍh, and ḍ, respectively. The complete inventory of consonant symbols was:

oIn 1973, there was a meeting of scholars in Pamekasan, the purpose of
which was to establish a standard orthography for Madurese. This orthography
is used in the chapters that follow. A decision was made to adopt a system that
paralleled the official spelling system used for Bahasa Indonesia and generally
accepted for Javanese. Like Javanese, Indonesian has only a two-way phonation contrast for stops (voiceless and voiced). Therefore, the same dilemma is
faced regarding the representation of the aspirated series of stops. Unlike Indonesian, Javanese includes a set of retroflex stops in addition to the dentalalveolar stops. The standard orthography for Javanese represents the retroflex
stops with the symbols th and dh. This convention was adopted in setting the
standard for Madurese. As dh was adopted for the voiced retroflex stop, the digraph dh (used in the Dutch system) was unavailable for [], and consequently
the digraphs with h were not available for any of the aspirated stops. Furthermore, no symbols were adopted that required special typesetting or keystrokes.
The result is a system in which the voiceless aspirated stops are represented
with the same symbols as their voiced counterparts; thus aspiration is not
represented in the orthography and can lead to confusion. So, for example, b
represents both [b] and [p].
Similarly, not all differences in vowel quality are represented in this system. Adhering to a principle of no diacritics or unusual symbols, [ɛ] and [ə] are
represented by the symbol e. This parallels the use of e to represent [e] and [ə]
in the Indonesian standard orthography. (Occasionally è is used to represent [ɛ]
to orthographically distinguish it from [ə], as is done for Javanese. But this is
not the normal practice.) Additionally, a is used for both [a] and [ɤ]. The other
vowels each take a different orthographic symbol. The potential for ambiguity
between a and e is reduced to varying degrees because of some distributional
regularities of [ɤ] and [ə]. First, as discussed above, [ɤ] is not phonemic and its
distribution is predictable: without exception, it occurs only following voiceless
aspirated and voiced stops and in the appropriate environment following a
transparent consonant ([r], [l], [w], [j]). [ɤ] never occurs as a non-alternating
vowel. Thus, it is transparent that the a’s in maca, the actor voice form for54 Chapter 2 Phonology
‘read’, are pronounced as [a] [maca], as well as in kata’ ‘frog’ [kata]. Given
the relatively small number of ‘non-alternating’ vowels, it is also the case that
most a’s following the orthographic symbols b, d, dh, j, and g represent [ɤ], as
in badha ‘exist’ [bɤḍɤ] and jaga ‘awake’ [cɤkɤ].
With respect to e, the ambiguity is more difficult to resolve. However, as
[] occurs only in closed syllables (which can trigger gemination at morpheme
boundaries), when e occurs in an open syllable it unambiguously signals a phonemic //. This is illustrated in the following, in which all e’s represent phonemic //: meja ‘table’, pote ‘white’, kene ‘now’. Additionally, given the vowel alternations, when e follows b, d, dh, j, or g, in the vast majority of cases (that is
barring a non-alternating vowel) it represents [ə], as in beddel ‘soak’, dhekdhek
‘bran’, jejjel ‘crammed, crowded’. However, in other closed-syllable environments, e may represent [ɛ] or [ə]. For example, in kenneng ‘get, hit’ the e of the
first syllable is [ə] and that of the second [ɛ] [kənnɛ], while in senneng ‘happy’
both are [ə] [sənnə], and in pennes ‘pocket knife’ both are [ɛ] [pɛnnɛs]. This
dual use of e can result in some minimal pairs (and near minimal pairs) taking
the same orthographic representation, such as kenneng which represents both
[kənnɛ] ‘get, hit’ and [kənnə] ‘place’, kerem which represents both [kɛrɛm]
‘send’ and [kɛrəm] ‘sink’, and pancer which represents both [pancər] ‘rudder’
and [pancɛr] ‘heel, rim’. Of course, while a completely phonetic alphabet is in
some ways desirable, for the native speaker of the language this alphabet need
not pose any particular problems. Safioedin (1977) adopts this standard in his
dictionary, which is given in (73).","[67, 68, 69, 70, 71]"

*morediIt is not the case that the notions denoted by the adjectival and nominal stems
are incompatible with a durative meaning. However, the durative morpheme
cannot be used to express this. Rather a timeframe must be explicitly indicated
to capture that aspect of the durative morpheme. As with other diagnostics for
verbs, the durative is not compatible with all roots that might be taken to be
verbs. Punctual verbs such as saba' ‘put’, temmo ‘find’, and others disallow the
suffix as the semantics of a punctual event and a durative state of affairs are
incompatible. Also, while agentive verbs such as berka' ‘run’, jalan ‘walk’ and
others are compatible with the durative morpheme, dynamic intransitive verbs
(those that involve action but not strong agentivity) such as labu ‘fall’, dhateng
‘come’, and others are incompatible with the durative marker.
As stated at the outset of this section, however, the category verb is the
most difficult single category to establish on positive independent grounds.
Many of the morphological properties that accrue to verbs but are unavailable to
adjectives and nouns may have a semantic explanation. Establishing adjective
as a distinct category may provide the necessary rationale for recognizing three
lexical categories for open class items, but here the results are equivocal as well.
1.3. The (sub)category adjective
The last of the open class lexical categories to consider is adjective. It has been
claimed for some Austronesian languages that there is no distinct category adjective, that lexical items denoting what are adjectives in other languages are
part of the category verb (Donohue 1999, Klamer 1998, van den Berg 1989).
And, in fact, Madurese adjectives and verbs share a great many properties,
properties which distinguish them from nouns. Some of these properties are
enumerated in section 1.3.1. Some characteristics that potentially distinguish
them are taken up in section 1.3.2, and the need for a separate category adjective is evaluated in light of these.
1.3.1. Adjective-verb similarities
The first properties shared by adjectives and verbs that distinguish them from
nouns were discussed above, when establishing the category noun. First, as
shown in (5), while nouns are negated with the quantifier banne ‘no’, adjectives
and verbs take the negative particle ta', or lo', which is used in Western Madura.","[86, 87]"

clitic form can be used when the numeral precedes the quantified nominal expression. This is illustrated in (80).
(80) settong roma or saroma ‘one house’
dhuwa' buku or dhu buku ‘two books’
tello' guru or tello guru ‘three teachers’
empa' mored or pa' mored ‘ four students’
lema' buku or lema buku ‘five books’
ennem sorat or nem sorat ‘six letters’
petto' toronan or pettong toronan ‘seven generations’
ballu' liter or ballung liter ‘eight liters’
sanga' bulan or sangang bulan ‘nine months’
The numbers 1, 2, 4, and 6 have truncated clitic forms. And only the number 4
retains its final glottal stop as a clitic. It is dropped in all of the other numbers
that end in glottal stop. The final glottal stop in the citation forms and the abbreviated forms is what Stevens (1968) refers to as an ‘extension’, a minor morphological category of limited membership, which in this case has no effect on
meaning but may be phonologically motivated. (See Chapter 4 section 3 for a
discussion of extensions.) Unlike the numbers 3 and 5, the clitics of the numbers 7-9 include a velar nasal ligature. This ligature does not occur in other positions. While using either the full or clitic form prenominally is fully acceptable, speakers generally use the clitic forms, particularly with 1 and 2.
When the number occurs without an explicit nominal expression or if it
follows the nominal expression that is quantified, only the full form is possible,
as in the examples in (81).

b. Loros kaju e-okor

‘The column was exactly the same size as the other three.’
c. Deni a-berri' buku lema' ka Tina.

‘Deni gave five books to Tina.’
d. Mored petto' bakal lulus ujiyan.
student seven will pass exam
‘Seven students will pass the exam.’Closed class categories 87In (81a), tello' ‘three’ quantifies and implicit argument given in the context. In
(81b), tello´ acts as the predicate of a relative clause, se tello' ‘the three’ (literally ‘those that are 3’). In (81c,d), the numbers follow the quantified expression
and occur in the full form, lema' ‘five’ and petto' ‘seven’, respectively. See
Chapter 7 section 7 for further discussion and illustration.
The clitic forms are generally, but again not obligatorily, used in numbers
above nine. For example, with polo ‘ten(s)’ standard is sapolo ‘ten’, dhu polo
‘twenty’, sangang polo ‘ninety’, and so on. Some of the higher numbers are
exemplified in (82).

25, 50, and 60. In addition, while 20 takes a predictable form dhupolo (literally
two tens), the numbers 21-24 and 26-29 take the ending lekor (20s). Thereafter
the general case is to use the citation form following the 10s designation, e.g.
tello polo ennem ‘36’.
To form ordinal numbers, the morpheme kapeng or its abbreviated form
ka, occurs before the numeral as in Cakraningrat kapeng dhuwa' or Cakraningrat ka dhuwa' ‘Cakraningrat the second’. Ordinals can also be formed in a
relative clause construction with the number as predicate occurring with the
prefix kapeng or ka (usually treated as a clitic), as in se kadhuwa' ‘the second’.
These forms are discussed in Chapter 7 section 7.
The basic Madurese quantifiers are:
(83)banne ‘no’
bannya' ‘many’
dhiddhi' ‘a few/a little/some’88 Chapter 3 Lexical categories
kabbi ‘all’
para ‘all’
sabban ‘each/every’
sakone' ‘a few/a little/some’
Quantifiers can be used to specify nouns, as in (84-85).
(84) Bannya' mored lulus ujiyan.
many student pass exam
‘Many students passed the exam.’
(85) Kabbi na'-kana' a-berka' ka sakola'an.
RED-child AV-run to school
all
‘All the children ran to school.’
In addition to being nominal specifiers, numerals and some quantifiers
can function as predicates.
(86) Ana'-eng Sri empa'.
child-DEF Sri four
‘Sri has four children.’
(87) Mored se lulus ujiyan bannya'.
student REL pass exam many
‘There are many students who passed the exam.’
Chapter 7 provides additional details about the distribution combining possibilities of numerals and quantifiers.
2.7. Interrogatives
Madurese contains a fairly typical set of interrogative expressions. Although
each one more properly belongs in one of the lexical classes, they are presented
as a group here as they are primary used as interrogatives.
(88) apa ‘what’
sapa ‘who’
kamma ‘which/where’
kemma ‘where’
dhimma ‘where’
arapa ‘why’
bila ‘when’Closed class categories 89dha'ramma ‘how’
baramma ‘how’
barampa ‘how much/many’
When reduplicated, most interrogatives are interpreted as indefinite pronouns
rather than interrogatives, e.g. pa-sapa ‘someone’, pa-apa ‘something’. Interrogatives are treated fully in Chapter 14.
2.8. Conjunctions
The set of coordinating conjunctions includes:
(89) ban ‘and’
tape ‘but’
otaba ‘or’pas ‘and then’
mangka ‘therefore’The conjunctions ban ‘and’ and otaba ‘or’ can be used to conjoin clauses or
NPs, as in (90).
(90) a. Hasan entar dha' Jakarta ban Ali entar dha' Bali.
Hasan go to Jakarta and Ali go
to Bali
‘Hasan went to Jakarta and Ali went to Bali.’
b. Bambang ban Ita melle buku.
Bambang and Ita AV.buy book
‘Bambang and Ita bought books.’
The prepositions bi' ‘with/by’ and moso ‘with/by’ (and its short form so) are
also used to coordinate NPs and could replace ban in (90b). All of the conjunctions can be used to conjoin phrasal as well as clausal units, while bi' and moso
can only be used to coordinate subclausal constituents, as discussed in Chapter
11 section 1.1. Subordinating conjunctions include:
(91) dumen ‘after’
ja' ‘that’
kalamon/mon ‘if’
ma' ‘so that’
make ‘if/when’
sambi' ‘while’ (also ‘in addition’ and ‘moreover’)
seddheng ‘while’
sopaja ‘so that’90 Chapter 3 Lexical categories
The sentences in (92) illustrate the subordinating conjunctions mon ‘if’ (92a)
and sopaja ‘so that’ (92b).
(92) a. Mon red-mored dhateng lo' tellat, guru senneng.
RED-student come
not late teacher happy
if
‘If the students arrive on time, the teacher is happy.’
b. Ali nyare'-e
obing
sopaja bisa ma-teppa' sapedha motor.
Ali AV.seek-DUR screwdriver so.that can AV.CS-right motorcycle
‘Ali was looking for a screwdriver so that he could fix the motorcycle.’
Subordinate clauses are also introduced by a host of derived forms. Chapters 11
and 12 include a detailed discussion of complex sentences.
2.9. Particles and interjections
As is the case in any language, there is a set of expressions important to conversation that do not fit neatly into any particular lexical categories. Many are expressions that signal the emotion or state of mind of the speaker. Others are
exhortations, expressions of agreement, and other sundry expressions. The positive and negative expressions are:
(93) Expressions of positive and negative
iya, ya ‘yes’ used in answering questions as well as for affirmative
emphasis and pausing in extended discourse
yut ‘yes’–alternate form used in the Bangkalan dialect area
ta' ‘not’–a verbal/adjectival negator
lo' ‘not’–dialectal variant of ta' used in the Bangkalan dialect area
enja' ‘no’–used in answering questions
ja' ‘don’t’–used in negative imperatives
ta'iya ‘right?’–combination of ‘no’ and ‘yes’ is used for tag questions
kan ‘right?’–used as a positive emphatic marker and a way for
speaker to check that the hearer is following
While some of these occur in fixed positions in a clause, kan can occur in a
variety of locations, including immediate preverbal position.
(94) Ba'eng kan ngatela' dibi'.
you EMPH AV-see self
‘You can see for yourself, right?’Closed class categories 91The use of most of these expressions is fairly straightforward. For example, the
negative particles ta' and lo' occur immediately before the verb of a clause or
any auxiliaries associated with the verb. Ja', the negative imperative marker also
immediately precedes the imperative form of the verb. Enja' ‘no’ occurs sentence initially, and ta'iya, used to form tag questions generally, but not exclusively occurs sentence finally. Finally, iya/ya ‘yes’ can occur freely in sentences. These various forms and their distribution in clauses are discussed in
more detail in later chapters.
Some of the interjections used in Madurese are:
(95) Interjections
adhu ‘oh/ah’–used to express surprise or distress
e ‘hey’–used to get someone’s attention
ha'–an exclamation used to denote pleasure, emptiness, or in asking
a question
la' ‘oh’
lo'–exclamation of surprise
o ‘ok’
oh–exclamation of realization or understanding
wa'–exclamation of surprise or distress
When used in a clause, adhu generally occurs in initial position as in the following example of adhu signaling the speaker’s distress.
(96) Adhu, engko' pas a-mempe dha' iya?
oh
I
then AV-dream like.this
‘Oh, why do I dream like this?’
There are a variety of other forms, many of which signal emphasis and/or
the speaker’s commitment to what he or she is saying.
(97) ano ‘whatsit, whachamacallit’–a hesitation form that can be used
nominally or verbally
ayu' ‘come on!, let’s go!’–an exhortation to action
mara ‘come on!, let’s...’–a hortative
ba'–a particle expressing doubt or the fact that what is being said is
perhaps unexpected
ja' ‘indeed, and so’–used to link consecutive thoughts
joh–an emphatic particle expressing assertion
me' ‘perhaps’–a particle expressing doubt that often occurs in
interrogatives
ra–an emphatic particle
sala ‘yet’–a particle expressing something counter to expectations92 Chapter 3 Lexical categories
In (98), ra serves to emphasize the negative imperative:
(98) Ja' nanges, ra!
EMPH
don’t cry
‘Don’t cry!’
The uses of me' and sala are illustrated in (99-100).
(99) Arapa me’ e-nyama-e pangpang se pangantan?
why EMPH OV-name-E column REL wedding.procession
‘Why did they call it ‘pang-pang se pangantan’?’
(100) Sala lo’ mandhi yang-seyang-nga.
EMPH not bathe RED-noon-DEF
He did not bathe in the afternoon.’
In (99), the speaker (a storyteller here) uses me' to signal his belief that the listener(s) will have some doubt about what the column in question would have to
do with a wedding procession. In (100), sala indicates that the action is unexpected and what’s more led to unexpected and undesirable results (in fact, the
death of the character who did not bathe). Both emphatic forms generally occur
in preverbal position, preceding any auxiliaries or clitics associated with the
verb.
2.10. Clitics
Madurese includes a set of forms that cliticize to the immediately following
word. These proclitics have a variety of functions and are drawn from various
lexical classes and the particles just discussed. The following set includes those
identified by Stevens (1968:77) and others.
(101) Clitics
e ‘at’
neng ‘at’
ka ‘to’
dha' ‘to’
ban ‘and’
nangeng ‘but’
pas ‘then’
mon ‘if’
san ‘when’
gan ‘up to’ta' ‘not’
lo' ‘not’
tang/sang ‘my’
me' ‘perhaps’
jung ‘more’
namong ‘only’
saleng/salang distributive/reciprocal
patang distributive/reciprocal
bareng ‘together’
padha ‘same/equal’Closed class categories 93neng ‘only’
sa ‘1’
dhu ‘2’
pa' ‘4’
nem ‘6’
Clitics can be identified phonologically and morphologically. Phonologically, they undergo rules relevant to what Stevens refers to as ‘dot juncture’,
and those that end in [a] invoke a special rule with roots that have an initial [].
Stevens’ ‘dot juncture’ rules and the glottal stop insertion rule are discussed in
Chapter 2. Briefly though, when the clitic form of ‘1’ combines with the form
ella ‘already’ [lla], a glottal stop is epenthesized between the adjacent vowels.
(102) [sa] + [əlla]  [saəlla] ‘after’
‘one’ ‘already’
Another phonological process that identifies certain clitics inserts a palatal glide
between two adjoining [ɛ] when the first is an affix or clitic. Thus, when the
object voice prefix occurs with a root initial [ɛ], [j] is epenthensized, as in (103).
(103) [ɛ] + [ɛnɔm]  [ɛjɛnɔm] ‘be drunk’
OV
‘drink’
The same process applies when the object of the preposition e ‘at’ begins with
[ɛ], as in (104).
(104) [ɛ] + [ɛlat kafɛ] [ɛjɛlat kafɛ] ‘at the Elat Cafe’
‘at’ ‘Elat Cafe’
This process does not occur in other environments in which there are two contiguous [], as between a verbal suffix and the following object, (105).
(105) [nɔlɔɛ] + [ɛpu] [nɔlɔɛ ɛpu] / *[nɔlɛjɛpu] ‘help mother’
‘help’
‘mother’
Morphologically, clitics can sometimes be incorporated into words. This
is particularly common with the causative prefix pa-. For example, there are
options with respect to the formation of causative reciprocal, but one of them is
to incorporate the morpheme salang/patang into the derived causative. In (106)
and (107) the causative morpheme occurs as ma, the Actor Voice signaled by
the homorganic nasal.","[102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110]"

(43) a. Ita entar ka barung.

One confounding factor is ascertaining whether the voice morphology is
purely inflectional. Some morphemes appear to be principally inflectional morphemes but at times seem to act derivationally, e.g. the locative -e. (See Chapter
4.) Some roots satisfy the criteria for precategoriality yet because of their denotation and their standard use can reasonably be classified as noun roots (which,
of course, might be asserted regarding the instrumental and locative roots just
discussed). Among these are:
(44) bine ‘wife’
ale' ‘younger sibling’
bapa' ‘father’
sapedha ‘bicycle’
kaos ‘t-shirt’a-bine ‘marry a woman’
a-ale' ‘call someone younger sibling’
a -bapa' ‘call someone father’
a-sapedha ‘ride a bicycle’
a-kaos ‘wear a t-shirt’These are potentially cases in which the actor voice morphology is working
derivationally. Alternatively, these could be instances of conversion or zero
derivation in which the noun root, say bine, becomes a derived verb and then
takes the voice morphology in its role as predicate. Regardless, the number of
precategorial roots in Madurese does not seem to be significant and they do not
play any crucial role in the grammar.","[93, 94]"
"236 Chapter 8 Prepositions and PPs
And third, while the agent of the ka-form can optionally be the object of the
preposition bi' ‘by’ (or one of the other forms discussed above), as in (59a), the
object of the preposition kaangguy cannot (59b).
(59) a. Buku jiya ka-angguy bi' Tina.
by Tina
book this KA-use
‘This book can be read by Tina.’
b. Buku jiya e-melle-yagi Siti kaangguy (*bi') Tina.
by Tina
book this OV-buy-AGI Siti for
‘Siti bought this book for Tina.’
Thus, while historically derived, kaangguy can be treated as a monomorphemic
lexical item (as it is in Safioedin’s (1977) dictionary and in grammatical expositions such as Moehilabib et al. 1979 and Soegianto et al. 1986).
2.2. ngangguy instrumental ‘with’
Ngangguy is the actor voice form of angguy ‘use’ and is much more transparently a derived form. In fact, there may be little reason to consider it a preposition inasmuch as the verbal form can quite naturally occur as a participial modifier like other verbs. However, it too has assumed a status almost independent
from verbal use. The sentences in (60) and (61) illustrate.
(60) Marlena a-massa' juko'-eng ngangguy bajan.

Marlena AV-cook fish-DEF AV.use
'Marlena cooked the fish using a frying pan.’

The notion ‘without’ can be expressed with the negation of ngangguy, as in
(60).
(62) Sengko' dujan tang nase' guring lo' ngangguy odhang.

‘I like my fried rice without shrimp.’
2.3. kalaban and ban ‘with’
Kalaban is the abilitive form of laban ‘fight face-to-face’. Its distribution isDerived prepositions 237similar to that of the nearly synonymous bi' and moso, expanding slightly on the
functions discussed in section 1.4.
First, PPs headed by kalaban serve a variety of instrumental and agentivetype functions include marking instruments (63), agents (64), abstract instrument/agent (65), and cause (66).
(63) Nabun mongkos sassa'-an kalaban koran.
newspaper
Nabun AV.wrap wash-NOM with
‘Siti wrapped the laundry in newspaper.’
(64) Aba'na lo' kala
kalaban satreya-satreya Mataram.
RED-knight
Mataram
he

‘He wasn’t defeated by other knights from Mataram.’
(65) Ya aher-ra kalaban ka-kowad-an-na sentana dhari Madura, Karta
NOM-strong-DEF soldier from Madura Karta
yes end-DEF with
Sura bisa e-pa-kala.
Sura can OV-CS-defeat
‘Finally, through the strength of the soldiers from Madura, Karta Sura
could be conquered.’
(66) Kalaban dha' iya,tanto-na rato Majapahit pas laju a-rassa
with
like.this certain-DEF king Majapahit then then AV-feel
ce' lebur-ra dha' kana' se kadhuwa' jareya.
this
very like-DEF to kid REL two
‘Because of this, the king of Majapahit came to like these two guys very
much.’
In (63), kalaban koran ‘with a newspaper’ is a simple instrument, and in (64)
kalaban satreya-satreya Mataram ‘by Mataram knights’ is an agent. In (65),
kakowadanna sentana dhari Madura ‘the strength of the Madurese soldiers’
denotes an abstract agency or instrumentality. And in (66), dha' iya ‘like this’
refers to the state of affairs described in the previous sentence which brought
about the current state of affairs.
In addition, as is true of bi' and moso, kalaban can head PPs that denote
associative objects (67), can be used in adverbial PPs (68), and can coordinate
two NPs (69).
(67) E-bagi dha' sodagar dhari Makassar jareya kalaban pessen,...
OV-give to
trader from Makassar this with
message
‘It was given to the trader from Makassar with the message...’238 Chapter 8 Prepositions and PPs
(68) Ba'ari'
Ale'

happy

‘Yesterday Little Sister washed the dishes happily.’
(69) Toron-na Sarifah Ambami kalaban Pangeran Cakraningrat settong
Pangeran Cakraningrat one
down-DEF Sarifah Ambami with
jareya terros bisa daddi rato neng Madura bara'.
this continue can become king at
Madura west
‘The descendents of Sarifah Ambami and Pangeran Cakraningrat I could
continue to rule western Madura.’
Thus, PPs headed by kalaban minimally serve the same functions as bi' and
moso.
The notion ‘without’ can also be realized using kalaban when the complement is a subjectless clause with the negated verb andhi' ‘have’.
(70) Ba'na reya e-lahir-ragi engko' kalaban ta' andhi' emma'.
with
not have father
you this OV-birth-AGI I
‘I gave birth to you without a father.’
As mentioned in section 1.4, kalaban has a truncated form ban, which has
much the same distribution as kalaban. Despite historically being a truncated
form, ban is often treated separately in grammars and dictionaries and is perceived as a separate form that functions as a preposition and a conjunction. Like
kalaban, however, it is used with comitatives (71) and comparatives (72). Additionally, some speakers (mainly younger ones) accept its use with instruments
(73) and agents (74).
(71) Siti maca
buku rowa ka-dhuwa’-an ban Marlena.
Siti AV.read book that KA-two-AN with Marlena
‘Siti read that book together with Marlena.’
(72) Gi' a-senneng-ngan Ita ban Bambang.

‘Ita is happier than Bambang.’
(73) %Noni noles

Noni AV.write letter with pen
‘Noni wrote a letter with pen.’Derived prepositions 239(74) %Rina e-pareksa ban dhokter rowa.
Rina OV-examine by doctor that
‘Rina was examined by that doctor.’
Most frequently, though, ban is used as a coordinating conjunction (75-76).
While use of kalaban as a conjunction is relatively rare, ban is used to coordinate both noun phrases and sentences (see Chapter 11 section 1).
(75) Ba'na kabbi ban sengko' kodu ng-ormat tamoy.

‘You and I should respect our guests.’
(76) Sundari entar dha' Lombok ban Hanina entar dha' Bali.
Sundari go
to Lombok and Hanina go to Bali
‘Sundari went to Lombok and Hanina went to Bali.’
2.4. katemgang and banding ‘than’
Katembang is the resultive/abilitive form of tembang ‘be equal, compare’. It is
used primarily to mark the object of comparison. The root tembang can also be
used in this environment. This is illustrated in (77) and (78).
(77) Dini a-senneng-ngan katembang Lukfi.
Lukfi
Dini AV-happy-AN than
‘Dini is happier than Lukfi.’
(78) Ina lebbi penter tembang Siti.
Ina more smart than
Siti
‘Ina is smarter than Siti.’
Banding is a verbal root, which like tembang means ‘compare, equal’. It is also
used in comparatives (79), and can optionally occur in the object voice form
ebanding.
(79) A-kowad-an Rudi banding Sale.
AV-strong-AN Rudi compare Sale
‘Rudi is stronger that Sale.’
(80) Bannya'-an buku-na Tono ebanding Bambang.
many-NOM book-DEF Tono OV.compare Bambang
‘Tono has more books than Bambang.’240 Chapter 8 Prepositions and PPs
2.5. lebat ‘through’
Lebat, a verbal root which means ‘pass by/through’, and indicates the path of
motion (80) or the conduit for some object of transference, which is also a path
of motion (81).
(80) Nompa' jaran lor-nyellor
lebat saba apa rowa.

(81) Daddi engko' menta'a

AV.ask-IRR send-NOM via you eat-NOM
so
I
‘So I will ask that food be sent through you.’
2.6. parkara and hal ‘concerning’, ‘in regard to’
The lexical items parkara and hal are noun roots which are used prepositionally
to denote ‘about, concerning, in regard to’. Parkara is a noun meaning ‘matter,
question, business’, and hal is a noun meaning ‘case, situation, point’.
(82) Wati a-bukte-yagi parkara Bambang ka Hasan ja' aba'eng a-berri'
Bambang to Hasan COMP he
AV-give
Wati AV-prove-AGI about

‘Wati proved about Bambang to Hasan that he gave money to Deni.’
(83) Atin a-koto'

Atin AV-whisper to Satimma about teacher
‘Atin whispered to Satimma about the teacher.’
(84) Guru-na
yaken hal Dina ja' aba'eng bakal lulus ujiyan.

teacher-DEF sure about Dina COMP she
‘The teacher is sure about the exam that Dina will pass it.’
2.7. sabab/bab ‘about’
Sabab is a noun root that means ‘cause, reason’. In its prepositional usage, the
truncated form bab is more frequently used.
(85) Hasan maca buku bab kopi.
Hasan AV.read book about coffee
‘Hasan read a book about coffee.’Complex locative expressions 241(86) Ali a-careta ka sengko' bab Sampang.
about Sampang
Ali AV-story to me
‘Ali told me about Sampang.’
The use of sabab as a preposition parallels that parkara and hal. Sabab is also
used as subordinating conjunction, as described in Chapter 12 section 3.2.
2.8. sabellunna ‘before’, sa'ellana ‘after’, samarena ‘after’
The temporal expressions ‘before’ and ‘after’ are complex forms in Madurese.
Each is composed of sa ‘one’ + root + na ‘DEF’: sabellunna ‘before’ is based on
the root bellun ‘not yet’, sa'ellana ‘after’ is based on the root ella ‘already’
(perfective), and samarena (and its variant samare) is based on the root mare
‘finish’. As will be shown in Chapter 9, bellun, ella, and mare are all preverbal
auxiliary-type elements that mark aspect. Examples of their prepositional use
are in (87-90).
(87) Nyo'on
tolong dhateng sabellunna pokol ballu'.
AV.request help come
before
8 o’clock
‘Please arrive before 8 o’clock.’
(88) Sabellunna taon 2001, a-jalan-an dha' Amerika lebbi gampang.
before
year 2001 AV-travel-IT to America more easy
‘Before 2001, traveling to America was easier.’
(89) Aba'eng dhateng sa'ellana ngakan malem.
he
come after
dinner
‘He arrived after dinner.’
(90) Samarena pa-mele-yan, ekonomi sajan becce.'
NOM-choose economy more good
after
‘After the elections, the economy improved.’
As is true of many other prepositions, sabellunna, sa'ellana, and samarena can take clausal complements and thus function as subordinating conjunctions. This use is detailed in Chapter 12.
3. Complex locative expressions
As is true of Indonesian, Javanese, and the other Indonesian-type languages,
Madurese contains a set of locative nouns which combine with the basic loca-242 Chapter 8 Prepositions and PPs
tive prepositions to denote various locations, this in lieu of a large number of
locative prepositions as found in many other languages. The set includes:
(91) adha' ‘front’
antara ‘between, gap’
attas ‘top, above’
baba ‘bottom, underneath’
budhi ‘behind, back’
dhalem ‘inside’
ereng ‘side’
lowar ‘outside’
seddi' ‘side’
semma' ‘close’
In the general case, these locative nouns combine with one of the basic locative
prepositions e/neng ‘at’, dha'/ka ‘to’, and dhari ‘from’. And the complex prepositions or complex locative expressions largely take the following form:
(92) locative P + locative N + na + object
The following illustrate the pattern:
(93) a. neng attas-sa meja
b. e antara-na ku-buku juwa‘on the table’
‘between those books’The locative noun + na + object actually constitute a possessive construction
with the object as possessor. The parallel between the PPs in (93) and (94) is
clear.
(94) a. neng bengko-na Bu’ Yus
b. e kantor-ra Bapa'‘at Bu Yus’s house’
‘at father’s office’The complex locative expressions can thus be more literally translated as ‘on
the table’s top’ and ‘at the those books’ gap’. The examples in sentences (9598) illustrate the same pattern.
(95) Neng adha'-eng langgar-ra jareya badha dampar bato.
at
front-DEF langgar-DEF this exist sitting rock.
‘In front of the langgar (small mosque) was a rock for sitting.’
(96) Tang telpon
badha neng baba-na
dlubung juwa.
my telephone exist at
underside-DEF paper that
‘My phone was under all those papers.’Complex locative expressions 243(97) Hasan nyaba' motor-ra e seddi'-na roma-na.
Hasan AV.put car-DEF at side-DEF house-DEF
‘Hasan put the car next to the house.’
(98) Ale'
a-sendem neng budhi-na ka'-bungka'an rowa.
back-DEF RED-tree
that
yngr.sibling AV-hide at
‘Little Brother is hiding behind that tree.’
There are exceptions to the general pattern, however. For example, dhalem ‘inside’ and lowar ‘outside’ rarely take the definite suffix, although it is
possible. Thus, there are well-formed sentences such as (99-102).
(99) Na'-ana'-na nyaba’ maen-an-na ka dhalem kothak.
RED-child-DEF AV.put play-NOM-DEF to inside box
‘The children put their toys in the box.’
(100) Rato pas a-tanya dha' keyae jiya e dhalem mempe-na...
king then AV-ask to kiai this at inside dream-DEF
‘The king then asked the kiai in his dream...’
(101) Se bi' kai-na
tao e-buwang dha' lowar Mataram iya
REL with father-DEF know OV-discard to
outside Mataram yes
areya dha' Selon.
this to Ceylon
‘He was banished from Mataram to Ceylon by his father.’
(102) Ng-edhing e lowar jareya cora' badha oreng a-tokar.
AV-hear
at outside this like exist person AV-fight
‘Outside (of this) they heard the sound of people arguing.’
In the case of dhalem, the definite suffix is always an option. While with lowar,
the definite suffix is only possible when the preposition e or neng (or dha' or
ka) is used. In addition, the suffix is fully optional with the other locative nouns
as well. Thus alongside (93a,b), while not preferred, (103a,b) are possible as
well.
(93) a. neng attas-sa meja
b. e antara-na ku-buku juwa‘on the table’
‘between those books’(103) a. neng attas meja
b. e antara ku-buku juwa‘on the table’
‘between those books’244 Chapter 8 Prepositions and PPs
This does not appear to be a question of formality but a question of style and
usage.
Locative expressions may be used with abstract nouns as well as concrete
nouns. In (104), the nominalized form of pekker ‘think (about)’ is the entity for
which a location, dhalem ‘inside’ is being specified. In (105), the object is the
abstract nominal kasossa'an ‘sadness’.
(104) Neng dhalem pekker-ra,Sarfiah Ambami jareya nyo'on dha'
at
inside think-DEF Sarfiah Ambami this AV.ask to
Se Kobasa...
Si Lord
‘During her meditation, Sarfiah Ambami asked the Lord...’
(105) Mon ra'yad-da dhalem ka-sossa'-an, Sarifah Ambami jareya gella'
Sarfiah Ambami this
before
if
people-DEF inside NOM-sad
gampang a-tolong.
AV-help
easy
‘If the people had problems, Sarifah Ambami gladly helped.’
In colloquial speech, the preposition preceding the locative noun is sometimes omitted as long as directionality or stativity plays no important role in
interpreting the clause, that is, for those situations in which it is not important to
indicate that the action is moving toward (ka, dha' ‘to’) or away from (dhari
‘from’) or is situated at (e, neng ‘at’) a particular location. This is true in (105),
in which dhalem occurs without a locative preposition. In (106b) and (107b),
concrete locations are specified, and speakers sometimes (especially younger
speakers) use the structures without the locative preposition that appears in the
a-variants. However, in direct questioning, there is a great deal of variation in
regard to this and only the a-variants are universally accepted.
(106) a. Ita badha e dhalem kamar.
Ita exist at inside room
‘Ita is in the room.’
b. %Ita badha dhalem kamar.
(107) a. Buku-na ba'eng badha e baba-na meja.
exist at under-DEF table
book-DEF you
‘Your book is under the table.’
b. %Bukuna ba'eng badha babana meja.
Finally, as is true of Indonesian-type languages in general, the locativePrepositions in other environments 245noun is omissible if the location described is the one canonically associated with
the object. So, attas ‘top’ may be omitted with meja ‘table’ if the object described is ‘on the table’ as the top is where one expects to find things with
tables. Any other location with respect to the table, such as ‘under’ obligatorily
requires the locative noun. Likewise, dhalem ‘inside’ is the typical location
associated with houses. (108) and (109) illustrate.
(108) Aba'na nyaba' paket e meja.
AV.put package at table
she
‘She put the package on the table.’
(109) Ebu' badha neng roma.
mother exist at
house
‘Mother is in the house.’
4. Prepositions in other environments
As touched on in Chapter 6 section 4.2, there are certain verbs which require
that their objects occur in PPs and verbs that are optionally transitive. Additionally, in nominalizations and under other specific conditions the direct object of a
clause occurs with the preposition dha' or ka ‘to’. These are considered in sections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.
4.1. Verb preposition combinations
With the basic form of verbs of communication, the addressee is marked by the
preposition dha'/ka ‘to’ or sometimes bi'/so ‘with’. These verbs include:
(110) acareta ‘tell’ (the root for ‘story’ in the actor voice), bala ‘say’, bisi'
‘whisper’, caca ‘talk’, oca' ‘say’, penta ‘ask’, so'on ‘ask’, soro ‘order’,
tanya ‘ask’
Examples are in (111) and (112).
(111) Hadi a-careta ka Deni bab ebu'-na.
Hadi AV-story to Deni about mother-DEF
‘Hadi told Deni about his mother.’
(112) Bapa' a-caca bi' polisi.
father AV-talk with police
‘Father spoke with the police.’246Chapter 8 Prepositions and PPsA number of verbs denoting cognitive states in their base form take an
object in a PP headed by dha' or ka.
(113) enga' ‘remember’, kennal ‘know’, loppa ‘forget’, ngarte ‘understand’,
percaja ‘believe’, tao ‘know’, yaken ‘sure’
As documented in Chapter 6 section 4.2, these verb-PP combinations are
marked by the fact that the preposition is optional for many speakers (114b).
(114) a. Wati enga'
dha' jawab-ba guru.
Wati remember to answer-DEF teacher
‘Wati remembered the teacher’s answer.’
b. %Wati enga'
jawab-ba guru.
Wati remember answer-DEF teacher
‘Wati remembered the teacher’s answer.’
Most verbs denoting emotional states can take a PP object, generally
headed by dha'/ka, but some take bi'. A partial list includes:
(115) baji' ‘hate’, bellis ‘hate’, busen (bi') ‘bored’, esto ‘love’, kasta ‘regret’,
lebur ‘happy with/about’, ledur ‘happy with/about’ (Bangkalan),
neser ‘pity’, peggel ‘angry’, senneng ‘happy’, sessel ‘regret’,
tresna ‘love’, tako' ‘afraid’
Of these, some are more clearly transitive than others, and as with the cognitive
verbs, the object may occur without a preposition. Thus, within this set of verbs,
baji' ‘hate’, bellis ‘hate’, esto ‘love’, kasta ‘regret’, neser ‘pity’, sessel ‘regret’,
and tresna ‘love’ pattern more closely with the cognitive verbs, which can be
attributed to being obligatory transitive. The possibility of preposition omission
is illustrated in (116) and (117).
(116) a. Ika tako' ka lar-olar.
Ika afraid to RED-snake
‘Ika is afraid of snakes.’
b. *Ika tako' lar-olar.
(117) a. Lukfi baji' ka taretan-na.
Lukfi hate to brother-DEF
‘Lukfi hates his brother.’
b. % Lukfi baji' taretan-na.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263]"
"350 Chapter 11 Complex sentences
4. Control
Unlike predicates taking object complements that can occur with the subordinat
ing conjunction ja', one class of predicates usually requires coreference between
one of its arguments and an argument in the complement clause. At times the
matrix coreferential argument is the actor, as in (67) and (68), and at times it is
an object argument, as in (69) and (70).
(67) Ari terro ajar-a
basa
inggris neng Australia.
Ari want study-IRR language English at Australia
‘Ari wants to study English in Australia.’
(68) Bu Nus nyajal nerrang-ngagi jawab-an
dha' mored-da.
Mrs Nus AV.try AV.clear-AGI answer-NOM to student-DEF
‘Bu Nus tried to explain the answer to her students.’
(69) Eppa' maksa Wati melle maen-an kaangguy Ale'.

father AV.force Wati AV.buy play-NOM for
‘Father forced Wati to buy a toy for Little Brother.’
(70) Ebu' a-lantor na'-kana' nenggu tifi sa.ejjam aggi'.
mother AV-allow RED-child AV.watch TV one.hour later
‘Mother let the children watch TV for one more hour.’
In (67), Ari is the subject, the actor, of the matrix predicate terro ‘want’ and is
obligatorily coreferential with the actor of the embedded clause ajara basa
inggris neng Australia ‘study English in Australia’. The embedded predicates of
verbs of desire generally occur with the irrealis suffix -a, as is true of ajar
‘study’ in (67). Likewise, the verb tolak ‘refuse’ requires its actor, the subject in
the actor voice, to be coreferential with the embedded actor. Thus, in (68), Ina
ban Siti is both matrix and complement actor. Predicates such as paksa ‘force’
(69) and lantor ‘allow’ (70) require coreference between the matrix object and
embedded actor; thus Wati is both object and actor in (69), as is na'-kana'
‘children’ in (70). Unlike most of the other predicates in this class, most speakers also accept complements of terro ‘want’ with a non-coreferential actor, as in
(71).
(71) Ebu' terro Ari ajar-a
basa
inggris neng Australia.
Australia
mother want Ari study-IRR language English at
‘Mother wants Ari to study English in Australia.’Control 351As illustrated in (72), coba' ‘try’ also allows a non-corferential actor in the
complement.
(72) Ali nyoba' Bambang ma-becce’ sapedha motor-ra bi’ obing.
Ali AV.try Bambang AV.CS-good motorcycle-DEF with screwdriver
‘Ali tried (to have) Bambang to fix his motorcycle with a screwdriver.’
These structures are reminiscent of control structures in other languages,
though without any obvious non-finiteness or tense restrictions on the complement clause typically found in other languages. Additionally, while the coreference requirement is generally (though not exclusively) sensitive to grammatical
functions in other languages such as subject and object, the coreference requirement for these structures in Madurese is largely sensitive to thematic relations. For example, the embedded argument in control structures in the majority
of languages must be the subject. In Madurese, it is generally the embedded
actor argument that must be coreferential. This is clear in (73), in which the
embedded clause is an object voice structure.
(73) Ali nyoba' sapedha motor-ra e-pa-becce’ bi’ obing.
Ali AV.try motorcycle-DEF OV-CS-good with screwdriver
‘Ali tried to fix his motorcycle with a screwdriver.’
In (73), the embedded subject of the object voice predicate epabecce' ‘fix’ is
sapedha motorra ‘his motorcycle’. The coreferential argument is the non-overt
actor, which is understood to be Ali. Madurese thus differs from many languages of the world but behaves the same as Tagalog (Schachter 1976), where in
many cases it is the actor, not the subject/topic which must be coreferential with
a matrix argument.
The facts are the same for structures in which it is a nonactor matrix argument which must corefer with an embedded argument. This is illustrated with
the verb lantor ‘allow’ in (74).
(74) Ebu' a-lantor na'-kana' tifi e-tenggu sa.ejjam aggi'.
mother AV-allow RED-child TV OV-watch one.hour later
‘Mother let the children watch TV for one more hour.’
In (74), the embedded subject is tifi . However, the matrix object na'-kana'
‘children’ is coreferential with the unexpressed embedded actor of tenggu
‘watch’. The sentence in (74) is synonymous with the sentence in (70), in which
the complement clause has an actor voice structure.
For many speakers, it is also possible for the matrix clause of subject control verbs to occur in the object voice. This is illustrated with the verb coba'
‘try’ in (66), and again in (75) with jajal ‘try’.","[366, 367, 368]"
"Voice 257(23) a. Ale'
e-kekke' bari',
bi' embi' rowa.
yngr.sibling OV-bite yesterday by goat that
‘That goat bit Little Brother yesterday.’
b. *Ale' ekekke' bari' embi' rowa.
(24) a. So polisi maleng rowa e-tangkep.
by police thief that OV-catch
‘The police caught the thief.’
b. *Polisi maleng rowa etangkep.
As stated above in section 1, despite the fact that word order and grammatical relations seem to align this structure with passives in other languages,
the functional load of object voice in Madurese (and other related languages)
differs from passives in other languages. Similar to passive, object voice is often
used when the agent is unspecified, as in (25).
(25) Ale'
e-kekke'.
yngr.sibling OV-bite
‘Little Brother was bitten.’
(26) Maleng rowa e-tangkep.

‘That thief was caught.’
But distributionally, the ratio of object voice structures in a discourse is far
higher than the ratio of passives in the relevant languages. In Madurese narratives, approximately 50-60% of all voice marking on transitive predicates is
object voice, as reported in Davies 2005 and discussed in more detail in Chapter
10 section 4. In English, the percentage is considerably smaller. For example,
Blankenship (1962) reports that passive clauses made up only 7.8% of clauses
in oral and 17.9% in written discourse; other reports based on experiment
(Poole and Field 1976, Biber 1988) and casual observation (e.g. Quirk et al.
1985) also assert passive has a low frequency in English. And similar reports
are available for other languages, e.g. Chinese (Xiao, McEnery and Qiang
2006). Additionally, in languages such as English, the percentage of passives
clauses with overt agents is quite low: 13-20% of passives have an agent phrase
(Svartik 1966, Duškova 1971, Givon 1979) and for German passives 17.8% has
been reported (Stein 1979). For Madurese, 60-70% or more object voice clauses258Chapter 9 VPs and verbal markinghave an overt agent or a discourse-linked null pronominal agent.6 Finally, it has
been proposed that in certain narrative discourse, actor voice and object voice
clauses play different functional roles: actor voice providing background information and object voice for advancing the plot line (see Hopper 1979 on Classical Malay, Davies 2005 on Madurese).
Added to this is the fact that some Indonesian languages, it has been proposed that object voice and passive are distinct structures. Arka (2003) identifies both object voice and passive in Balinese. According to Arka, object voice
is indicated by lack of voice morphology (27) and passive by the suffix -a (28).7
(27) Nyoman ejuk
polisi.
Nyoman OV.arrest police
‘The police arrested Nyoman.’Balinese(28) Nyoman baang-a pipis teken Wayan.
Nyoman give-PASS money by Wayan
‘Nyoman was given money by Wayan.’BalineseAdditionally, the agent of the object voice in Balinese must be an unmarked NP
(as in (27)) and is a core argument that can participate in a number of grammatical structures (e.g. quantifier float, topicalization, imperatives and others), while
the agent in the passive is expressed in a PP (as in (28)) and is not a core argument and thus does not participate in other grammatical structures. Specifically,
Arka shows that the agent in the object voice structure can antecedent a reflexive while the agent of a passive cannot.
The types of grammatical distinctions observable in Balinese do not exist
in Madurese; that is, there is no discernable difference in the grammatical behavior of the agent when it is an NP and when it is the object of a PP. In particular, unlike Balinese, the agent of the Madurese object voice structure is able to
bind a reflexive-like element.

cat-DEF
‘Your cat stole the fish.’84 Chapter 3 Lexical categories
Finally, as is true of many languages in the area, personal names and
terms of address can serve as pronouns. For example, the sentence in (73) can
unexceptionally be uttered by the narrator in reference to himself as he tells a
story, and thus is translated here in the first person.
(73) Se e-ka-dungeng-a bapa' sateya, oreng penter jareya se
REL OV-KA-story-IRR father now
person smart this REL
badha neng Napo.
exist at
Napo
‘The story I will tell you now is about this smart person who lived in
Napo.’
A more detailed look at this and other aspects of anaphora is included in Chapter 13.
2.5. Demonstratives
In addition to the pronouns just discussed, Madurese includes deictic demonstratives that can also function as pronouns. Although there are just two basic distinctions made in demonstratives, there are many variants of these, some due to
dialect and some due to speech style (formal vs. informal). The forms are:
(74) a. proximal: reya, areya, jareya, jariya, jiya, jeh
b. distal: rowa, arowa, juwa
Demonstratives may specify nouns in NPs, as in preceding sentences and the
following:
(75) Koceng jiya ngeco' tang juko'.
cat
this AV.steal my fish
‘This cat stole my fish.’
(76) Ke Pegke jiya dujan a-leng-keleleng neng ponduk jiya.
Ke Pegke this like AV-RED-around at school this
‘Ke Pegke liked to walk around the school.’
In (75), jiya specifies that the koceng ‘cat’ being discussed is physically proximate to the speaker (or has very recently been mentioned in the discourse). In
(76) there are two instances of jiya. The second, in ponduk jiya ‘this school’,
specifies not that the religious school is close to the speaker but that it is the
school that the speaker has just referred to, and so the proximal form is used.
The first instanc in (76), Ke Pegke jiya, illustrates the fact that demonstrativesClosed class categories 85are often used with names, in this instance again specifying that this is a person
that the speaker has referred to earlier. Demonstratives can also be used to identify a person as being proximate or distant from the speaker.
Demonstratives can also be used pronominally; they are, in fact, the only
available pronominal forms for inanimate objects.
(77) Sengko' ng-angguy reya banne rowa.
AV-use
this no
that
I
‘I used this one, not that one.’
(78) Jiya sala manes.
this yet sweet
‘Nevertheless they are sweet.’
In (77), an answer to the question ‘Which pen did you use?’, riya ‘this’ and
rowa ‘that’ refer to pens on a table near the speaker. Here the distal form rowa
is used because compared to the first pen it is farther from the speaker. And in
(78), jiya refers to a type of banana currently being described by the speaker.
The position of demonstrative in NPs is taken up in Chapter 7.
2.6. Numerals and quantifiers
Madurese numerals and quantifiers are used both as specifiers in NPs and as
predicates themselves. The numbers 1-9 have full, abbreviated, and clitic forms.

"Cross-clausal null anaphora 433Null subjects and objects of transitive actor voice verbs can also occur.
(75) ___ Lo' bisa keya. ___ Keng bisa mangguk
___ tape ___ lo' bisa
but
not able
not able too
only able AV.pull toward
amolong ___, ___ lo' bisa metthek ___.
AV.collect
not able AV.pick
‘She failed too. She could lower them, but she wasn’t able to grab them,
she wasn’t able to pick them.’
The sentences in (75) describes a scene in which a woman attempts to pick
some flowers but is unsuccessful. In the second sentence, in each case both the
subject and the object of the actor voice verbs mangguk ‘pull toward’, amolong
‘collect’, and metthek ‘pick’ are null, the subject referring to the woman and the
object the flowers. Null objects do not occur in embedded clauses, however.
Finally, in (76) there are two consecutive intransitive clauses with null
subjects; however, in this case each has a distinct referent.
(76) ___ Mate pas ___ mennang, ya tanto-na
rato bunga.
dead then
win
yes certain-DEF king happy
‘He died, Radin Sagara won and, of course, the king was happy.’
The discourse context surrounding (76) is a battle between a Chinese king waging war on the Giling Tosang kingdom and the legendary Radin Sagara. The
null subject of mate ‘die’ refers to the Chinese king, but the null subject of
mennang ‘win’ refers to Radin Sagara. Thus, with sufficient context the subjects
of contiguous intransitive clauses can be null even then they have different referents.
4. Cross-clausal null anaphora
As described in Chapter 11 there are instances of obligatory coreference between an NP in the matrix clause and a null anaphor in a dependent clause.
These include control structures and the proleptic object structure. In the case of
control into a complement clause, either the subject or the actor of the embedded clause is null, its reference determined by a matrix argument.
(77) Ina ban Siti nolak
___ magi
perman-na dha' embug-ga.
AV
.refuse
AV
.give
candyDEF to eld.sister-DEF
Ina and Siti
‘Ina and Siti refused to give their candy to their older sister.’434 Chapter 13 Anaphora
(78) Eppa' maksa Wati ___ melle maen-an kaangguy Ale'.
AV.buy play-NOM for
yngr.sibling
father AV.force Wati
‘Father forced Wati to buy a toy for Little Brother.’
In (77), the complement subject is null and its reference supplied by the matrix
subject, Ina ban Siti . In (78), it is the matrix object Wati that determines the
referent of the null complement subject. The sentences in (79) and (80) are variants of (77) and (78), respectively, in which the complement clause is in the
object voice rather than the actor voice.
(79) Ina ban Siti nolak
perman-na e-bagi ___ dha' embug-ga.
to eld.sister-DEF
Ina and Siti AV.refuse candy-DEF OV-give
‘Ina and Siti refused to give their candy to their older sister.’
(80) Eppa' maksa Wati maen-an e-belli ___ kaangguy Ale'.
for
yngr.sibling
father AV.force Wati play-NOM OV-buy
‘Father forced Wati to buy a toy for Little Brother.’
In (79), the embedded subject of the object voice predicate ebagi ‘give’ is permenna ‘their candy’. Here the coreferential argument is the non-overt actor,
which is understood to be Ina ban Siti. Similarly, in (80), the embedded subject
is maenan ‘toy’. However, the matrix object Wati is coreferential with the null
embedded actor of belli ‘buy’. Control into complement clauses is discussed in
detail in Chapter 11 section 4.
Another structure requiring coreference between matrix and complement
dependents is the prolepsis structure. In this structure an extra object argument
in the matrix clause is obligatorily coreferential with a complement clause dependent. Unlike the control structure, the structure is not restricted to complement subject or actors but admits any grammatical dependent of the complement.
(81) Inai e-kera (bi') Siti ja’ ___i mangkat ka Jakarta are Kemmes.
leave
to Jakarta day Thursday
Ina OV-think by Siti COMP
‘Siti thinks that Ina left for Jakarta on Thursday.’
(82) Siti ngera
Hasani ja' motor juwa e-belli ___i.
Siti AV.think Hasan COMP car that OV-buy
‘Siti thinks that Hasan bought that car.’
ana'-eng ___i.
(83) Siti ngera
Hasani ja' dhokter juwa mareksa
Siti AV.think Hasan COMP doctor that AV.examine child-DEF
‘Siti thinks that the doctor examined Hasan’s child.’Cross-clausal null anaphora 435In (81) the complement subject is coreferential with the matrix subject, in (82)
the complement post-verbal agent is coreferential with the matrix object, and in
(83) the possessor of the object of the complement clause is coreferential with
the object. As indicated in the examples, the null element is actually a null pronoun. Evidence for this is that an overt pronoun can occur instead, which is
fairly standard with objects and obligatory in the case of prepositional objects.
Details of the structure are given in Chapter 11 section 6.
A final instance of cross-clausal anaphora is control into adverbial clauses. Although cross-clausal dependency is not obligatory in most cases, the subject of an adverbial clause is frequently a null pronoun coreferential with an
argument in the matrix clause. This is illustrated in (84-87), in which the adverbial clauses are marked with brackets.
(84) Embuk ngetek [e bakto ___ a-caca ka guru-na].
AV-talk to teacher-DEF
eld.sister AV.shaky at time
‘Big Sister gets nervous whenever she talks to her teacher.’
(85) Juko' juwa e-kakan koceng-nga [polana ___ lapar].
because
hungry
fish that OV-eat cat-DEF
‘The cat ate the fish because it was hungry.’
(86) Soleha a-juwal selo'-eng [sopaja ___ bisa melle kakanan].
can AV.buy food
Soleha AV-sell ring-DEF so.that
‘Soleha sold her ring so that she could buy food.’
(87) Ba'eng ja' endha' mole
dha’ Madura ban Sumennep [mon ___
you don’t want go.home to
Madura and Sumenep if
gilo' bisa ma-kala
rato Blambangan].
not.yet can AV.CS-defeated king Blambangan
‘You won’t be allowed to go home to Madura and Sumenep until you
defeat the king of Blambangan.’
Each of the adverbial clauses has a null subject, and in each case it is the actor
of the matrix clause that controls its reference: Embuk ‘Big Sister’ in (84), kocengnga ‘the cat’ in (85), Soleha in (86) and ba'eng ‘you’ in (87). In most cases,
a coreferential overt pronoun is always possible, as in (88), a variant of (86).
(88) Soleha a-juwal selo'-eng [sopaja aba'eng bisa melle kakanan].
can AV.buy food
Soleha AV-sell ring-DEF so.that
‘Soleha sold her ring so that she could buy food.’436 Chapter 13 Anaphora
5. Ellipsis and gapping
In keeping with the fact that there is widespread use of null pronouns, almost
any material can be dropped from a clause that is nearly identical to the clause
that precedes it. First, all of the material in a verb phrase can be omitted if identical to the verb phrase in the preceding clause. This is illustrated in (89) and
(90)
(89) Pa' guru a-berri' pesse dha' mored se dhari Kamal, Dayat keya.
Mr teacher AV-give money to student REL from Kamal Dayat too
‘The teacher gave money to the student from Kamal, and Dayat did too.’
(90) Tono e-pokol kana' rowa, Lukman keya.
Tono OV-hit child that Lukman too
‘Tono was hit by that child, and Lukman was too.’
In (89), an actor voice VP aberri' pesse dha' mored se dhair Kamal ‘gave money to the student from Kamal’ is missing from the second of the conjoined
clauses under identity with the VP of the first clause. In (90) it is the object
voice VP epokol kana' rowa ‘hit by that guy’ that is understood to be the VP of
the second conjunct.
Verbs can be gapped in the second of two conjuncts, leaving behind the
remainder of the VP, as in (91-93).
(91) Bapa' maca koran,
Ebu' buku.
father AV.read newspaper mother book
‘Father read a newspaper, and Mother a book.’
(92) Hanina entar dha' Borobudur, Sinap dha' Prambanan.
Hanina go
to Borobudur Sinap to Prambanan
‘Hanina went to Borobudur, and Sinap to Prambanan.’
(93) Wati ma-becce' sapedha motor bi' obing,
Abu motor bi' tokol.
with screwdriver Abu car
with hammer
Wati AV.CS-fix motorcycle
‘Wati fixed the motorcycle with a screwdriver, and Abu (fixed) the car
with a hammer.’
In (91), the verb maca ‘read’ has been gapped in the second clause, in (92) entar ‘go’, and in (93) mabecce ‘fix’.
Finally, any parts of a VP that repeat information from the previous
clause may be omitted.","[449, 450, 451, 452, 453]"
"Pronouns 185(15) sengko', engko', aba' ‘I’
ba'na, ba'en, ba'eng, kake, sedha ‘you’1
aba'na, aba'eng, dibi'na, dibi'eng ‘he/she’
The noun root aba' ‘body’ (cognate with Javanese awak) forms the stem for
second and some third person forms. The most common form for second person
is the shortened stem ba' with the definite suffix -na. In Western Madura, the
form is ba'eng, following the rule that replaces -na with the allomorph -eng
following a glottal stop. The form ba'en also is used in Central Madura, in the
areas near Sampang and Pamekasan (Sutoko, Soegianto, Surani, Sariono, and
Suyanto 1998; Pawitra 2009). Additionally, the third person forms aba'na and
aba'eng are also frequently used for second person (16). The dominant third
person forms are aba'na and aba'eng. Dibi'na and dibi'eng, derived from the
root dibi' ‘alone’, are also used but to a somewhat lesser extent, illustrated in
(17). Additionally, as (18) and (19) demonstrate, the word aba' can serve as a
pronoun on its own. In each case here, aba' is used to designate the speaker.

The fact that the number and unit of measure can follow the quantified noun
and the number must immediately precede the measure expression provides
some evidence that the number and the unit of measure noun form a constituent.
The measure phrase behaves like other numerals and quantifiers in its ability to
either precede or follow the quantified noun.
Naturally, count nouns can also occur with measure phrases, when the
speaker wishes to specify particular units. Examples such as packets, boxes,
truckloads, and the like.
(114) Bambang ngakan sabungkos/sabuntel kropok.

Bambang AV.eat one.packet
‘Bambang ate a whole packet of crackers.’
(115) Sengko' melle po'lot dhu kothak.

I
‘I bought two boxes of pencils.’
Finally, biggi' ‘seed’ and meggi' ‘seed’ can both be used as a general measurement unit for small objects, (116) and (117). This construction is optional in
Madurese but parallels the use of biji ‘seed’ as a classifier in Indonesian.
(116) a. Siti a-berri' buku lema meggi' dha' Sale.
Siti AV-give book five seed to Sale
‘Siti gave five books to Sale.’
b. Siti a-berri' lema meggi' buku dha' Sale.

‘Siti gave five books to Sale.’Adjectival modification 207(117) a. Kaka'

eld.brother AV.eat banana seven seed
‘Big Brother ate seven bananas.’
b. Kaka'
ngakan pettong biggi' geddhang.
eld.brother AV.eat seven seed banana
‘Big Brother ate seven bananas.’
As with other number/unit of measure phrases, the phrase may either follow
(116a) and (117a) or precede (116b) and (117b) the quantified noun.
9. Adjectival modification
Adjectival modification occurs in one of two ways. In one instance, a bare attributive adjective immediately follows the noun that it modifies, as (118-120).
(118) Koceng koros rowa ngeco' juko'.
cat
thin that AV.steal fish
‘That skinny cat stole the fish.’
(119) Mored rowa maca buku tebbel.
student that AV.read book thick
‘The students read a thick book.’
(120) Ina melle bengko anyar.
I AV.buy house new
‘Ina bought a new house.’
Alternatively, adjectives can modify a head noun as the predicate of a relative
clause, the relative clause following the head. The sentences in (121-123) are
equivalent to (118-120), respectively.
(121) Koceng se koros rowa ngeco' juko'.
REL thin that AV.steal fish
cat
‘That skinny cat stole the fish.’
(122) Mored rowa maca buku se tebbel.
student that AV.read book REL thick
‘The students read a thick book.’208 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases
(123) Ina melle bengko se anyar.
Ina AV.buy house REL new
‘Ina bought a new house.’
There is a preference for the relative clause construction for adjectival modification, though both methods are fully acceptable.
When more than one adjective modifies the same noun, the preferred
structure is for the adjectives to be coordinately conjoined using ban, as in (124)
and (125).
(124) Bengko mera ban raja rowa ancor.
house red and big that collapse
‘That big and red house collapsed.’
(125) Embi' koros ban lapar rowa ngekke' Ale'.
goat thin and hungry that AV.bite yngr.sibling
‘That skinny hungry goat bit Little Brother.’
Multiple adjectival modifiers can also occur as coordinately conjoined predicates in relative clauses, as in (126) and (127).
(126) Ika ban Adi maca buku se tebbel ban mera.
Ika and Adi AV.read book REL thick and red
‘Ika and Adi read the book that is thick and red.’
(127) Siti a-caca bi' mored se penter ban gantheng.
Siti AV-talk with student REL smart and handsome
‘Siti talked to the student who is smart and handsome.’
Additionally, some speakers allow the adjectives to be stacked, one right after
the other, immediately following the noun, although it is rare and not a preferred structure.
(128) Ika ban Adi maca buku tebbel mera rowa.
Ika and Adi AV.read book thick red that
‘Ika and Adi read that thick red book.’
(129) Koceng celleng koros juwa lo' tedhung.
cat
black thin that not sleep
‘The skinny black cat is not asleep.’
For the most part, modified adjectives are used predicatively rather thanAdjectival modification 209attributively and usually occur in relative clause modifiers of nouns, as in
(130b) and (131b).
(130) a. Aba’ reya kodu ng-enom kopi cellep.
body this must AV-drink coffee cold
‘We had to drink cold coffee.’
b. Aba’ reya kodu ng-enom kopi se ce’ celleb-ba.

‘We had to drink very cold coffee.’
(131) a. Embi' koros rowa ngekke' Ale'.

‘The skinny goat bit Little Brother.’
b. Embi' se koros gallu rowa ngekke' Ale'.
goat REL thin too that AV.bite yngr.sibling
‘The goat that is too skinny bit Little Brother.’
Adjectival modifiers in the intensive construction (131b) can only occur in relative clause modifiers; thus (132) is unacceptable.
(132) *Embi' koros gallu rowa ngekke' Ale'.
goat thin too that AV.bite yngr.sibling
(That too skinny goat bit Little Brother.)
Some, but not all, speakers accept intensive adjectives as attributive modifiers
outside of relative clauses in which case they directly follow the modified noun,
as in (133) and (134).
(133) Selaenmandhi,Empu Kelleng jiya ngobukerbuyREL different AV.iron.work Empu Kelleng this AV.raise buffaloce' bannya'-eng.

on his very tall black horse.’210 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases
In (134), the intensive adjective ce' tenggina ‘very tall’ is part of a sequence of
adjectival modifiers.
10. Prepositional phrase modifiers
Prepositional phrase modifiers show some of the same properties as adjectival
modifiers. Like adjectival modifiers they follow the noun in the noun phrase
and can occur either as plain PP modifiers, as in (135a) and (136a), or as predicates in relative clause modifiers, as in (127b) and (136b).
(135) a. Tang tamoy maca buku bab kopi.
my guest AV.read book about coffee
‘My guest read the book about coffee.’
b. Tang tamoy maca buku se bab kopi.
my guest AV.read book REL about coffee
‘My guest read the book about coffee.’
(136) a. Kana' dhari Kamal rowa mennang addu-wan.5
child from Kamal that won
compete-NOM
‘That guy from Kamal won the game.’
b. Kana' se dhari Kamal rowa mennang addu-wan.
compete-NOM
child REL from Kamal that won
‘That guy from Kamal won the game.’
There is a strong preference for prepositional modifiers in relative clauses
where otherwise ambiguity would result. So, the potential ambiguity of e meja
‘at the table’ in (137), where the PP could modify either the predicate or the
noun buku is resolved by the use of the relative clause construction in (138).
The strongly preferred interpretation of (137) is that of predicate modifier, as
reflected in the translation.
(137) Bambang maca buku e meja.
Bambang AV.read book at table
‘Bambang read the book at the table.’ (indicating where Bambang read)5The form kana' ‘child’, which has the k extension added to the root ana' ‘child’, often
refers to a person not well-known to the speaker. In this use, illustrated in (136), it is
best rendered in English as ‘guy’ or ‘kid’.","[222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227]"

Speech levelsReferences to speech levels in Madurese occur sporadically in previous chapters, most prominently in the discussion of pronouns in Chapters 3 and 7. As
shown there, in addition to the paradigm of ‘common’ pronouns, there are additional first and second person forms. The paradigms of first and second person
pronouns are given in (1).

ajunan panjennengnganThere are three divisions of personal pronouns: kasar ‘rough’, tengnga'an ‘middle’, and alos ‘refined’. Kasar is also referred to as mapas by the Madurese, and
sometimes ngoko, a term borrowed from Javanese. The pronouns used in any
particular interaction are to be selected in accord with the respective social status of the interlocutors. There are multiple kasar/mapas pronouns for 2 nd person.
These represent dialectal differences. The considerable list of alos forms
represents increasing respect toward the addressee; the last few being used only
when speaking with the nobility, kings and God. The Madurese people often
refer to the three vocabularies as enja' iya, enggi enten, and enggi bunten,
which, as shown in (2) below, are the words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’ for each level.1
1Although within the 1973 spelling system the words for 'yes' in both tengnga'an and
alos are spelled enggi, they are pronounced differently, [ki] in tengnga'an and470 Chapter 15 Speech levels

"106 Chapter 4 Morphology
toles ‘write’
massa' ‘cook’nolesan ‘write often’
amassa'an ‘cook often’The iterative suffix can carry the connotation that the subject engages in the
activity frequently due to enjoying it. So berka’an can be translated ‘like to run’
and amassa’an ‘like to cook’. They can also be translated simply to indicate
that the action occurred more than once, e.g. nolesan ‘write multiple times’
1.1.10. Durative -e, /ɛ/
Another suffix that denotes iterated activity is the durative -e, one of two verbal
suffixes -e. When the durative is suffixed to verb stems, the resulting verb denotes an iterated activity carried out for a continuous period of time.
(31) poger ‘chop’
toles ‘write’
pokol ‘hit’
massa' ‘cook’mogerre ‘chop for a while’
nolese ‘write for a while’
mokole ‘hit repeatedly for a while’
amassa'e ‘cook for a while’1.1.11. ‘Locative’ -e, /ɛ/
When affixed to verbs taking a goal argument, whether a physical goal as with
kerem ‘send’ or entar ‘go’ or the goal of emotion as with tresna ‘love’,
-e can derive a verb in which the goal argument is the direct or primary object,
that is, it indicates an endpoint. In other Western Austronesian languages, this is
often referred to as a locative affix. The derived verb is transitive, even when
the base verb is intransitive, as with entar ‘go’. (See Chapter 10 section 1 for a
detailed discussion.)
(32) kerem ‘send’
entar ‘go’
busen ‘bored’
parcaja ‘believe’
bala ‘say’kereme ‘send to’
entare ‘go to’
busenne ‘bored with’
parcajai ‘believe in’
balai ‘say to’The locative -e is involved in a highly specific morphophonemic rule.
When followed by the irrealis suffix -a, -an is substituted for -e.
(33) kereme ‘send to’
balai ‘say to’
busenne ‘bored with’keremana ‘will send to’
bala'ana ‘will say to’
busennana ‘will be bored with’Affixation 107A small number of speakers have innovated and have regularized the sequence
of -e + -a, thus producing the forms in (34) in place of those in (33). However,
this is a very small minority of speakers and does not represent the standard of
any dialect. (The fact that some speakers but not others accept a particular form
or sentence is marked by ‘%’ throughout.)
(34) %keremeya ‘will send to’
%balaiya ‘will say to’
%busenneya ‘will be bored with’
Perhaps best considered a separate affix, when affixed to some adjectival
stems, -e derives transitive verbs with a causative meaning, ‘make something
have the quality of the adjective’, accompanied by the actor voice morpheme in
the actor voice.
(35) pote ‘white’
mate ‘dead’
tako’ ‘afraid’
kene’ ‘small’apote'e ‘make white’
mate'e ‘kill’
nako'e ‘scare’
ngene'e ‘make small’Related to this causative form of -e, with a few adjectival predicates and
noun roots suffixation of -e results in a verb that means to ‘act like X’ or ‘look
like X’.
(36) penter ‘smart’
towa ‘old’
disa ‘village’
kottha ‘city’
rato ‘king’menterre ‘act like an intelligent person’
nowae ‘look older than one is’
nisane ‘look like someone from the village’
ngotthai ‘look like someone from the city’
ngratone ‘act like a king’1.1.12. ‘Benefactive’ -agi, /akɛ/
When suffixed to a transitive verb stem, -agi largely derives verbs in which the
direct or primary object is understood as the beneficiary of the action.
(37) giba ‘carry’
belli ‘buy’
kerra' ‘slice’
toles ‘write’
kerem ‘send’ngeba'agi ‘carry for’
melleyagi ‘buy for’
ngerra'agi slice for’
nolessagi ‘write for’
ngeremmagi ‘send for’108 Chapter 4 Morphology
There are a very few intransitive verbs for which suffixation of -agi results in a
beneficiary.
(38) asassa ‘do laundry’
asapo ‘sweep’
ngopi ‘to make coffee’asassa'agi ‘cook rice for’
asapowagi ‘sweep for’
ngopiyagi ‘make coffee for’When suffixed to a verb of communication, such as bala ‘say’, bisi’
‘whisper’ and so on, -agi derives verbs in which the subject matter being communicated is the object.
(39) bala ‘say’
careta ‘say’
bisi’ ‘whisper’abala'agi ‘say about’
acraeta'agi ‘tell about’
abisi'agi ‘whisper about’As is true of -e, for some intransitive verb stems and adjectival roots, suffixation
of -agi derives a causative verb.
(40) kennal ‘know’
senneng ‘happy’
tedhung ‘sleep’
mole ‘go home’ngennallagi ‘introduce’
nyennengngagi ‘please someone’
nedhungngagi ‘put to bed’
moleyagi ‘send home’There is variation regarding the acceptability of some of these words. Some
speakers reject these, strongly preferring or only accepting causatives with the
causative prefix pa-. See Chapter 10 section 3 for a detailed discussion of Madurese causatives.
There is a small number of nouns which, when used to describe a location, can combine with -agi to form transitive verbs that denote the action of
putting an object or objects in that location. This is illustrated in the sentences in
(41b) and (42b)
(41) a. Ali noles
panghaselan e buku.
at book
Ali AV.write income
‘Ali entered the income in the book.’
b. Ali a-buku-wagi panghaselan.
A AV-book-AGI income
‘Ali entered the income in the book.’Affixation 109(42) a. Polisi nyaba' maleng e penjara.
at jail
police AV.put thief
‘The police put the thief in jail.’
b. Polisi a-penjara'-agi maleng.
thief
police AV-jail-AGI
‘The police jailed the thief.’
As is clear from the pair of sentences in (42) and their English translations, this
has its analogue in English, where there is no derivational morphology but simple conversion of the noun jail to a verbal use. Finally there is also an instrumental use of -agi in which the instrument of selected verbs is the direct object,
as in (43b).
(43) a. Siti mungkos sassa'an kalaban koran.
newspaper
Siti AV.wrap laundry with
‘Siti wrapped the laundry with newspaper.’
b. Siti mungkos-sagi koran
ka sassa'an.
Siti AV.wrap-AGI newpaper to laundry
‘Siti wrapped newspaper around the laundry.’
This construction is detailed in Chapter 10 section 2.4.
1.2. Nominal morphology
A number of morphemes, when affixed to various stems, derive nouns. As will
be clear in the course of the discussion, many of the morphemes used to derive
nouns have the same phonological shape as morphemes that derive verbs. It is
this kind of identity of noun and verb morphology that sometimes leads to
claims about precategoriality (Jelinek and Demers 1994, Foley 1998).
1.2.1. Definite -na, /na/
The most frequently occurring morpheme with nouns is the definite suffix -na.
Suffixation to a consonant-final stem (other than glottal stop) triggers the morphophonological process described in Chapter 2 section 6, in which the [n] totally assimilates to the final consonant of the stem, resulting in a geminate consonant. It occurs in possessive constructions (such as the data in Chapter 3
section 2.4 on pronouns), in which it is suffixed to the possessed noun, which is
followed by the possessor.","[122, 123, 124, 125, 126]"
"Causatives 3152.8. The meaning/function of -agi and Indonesian -kan
Compared to -e, -agi appears to play a role in more disparate structures, making
attempts at a unified account on largely semantic grounds relatively more difficult. In recent work, Cole & Son (2004) and Son & Cole (2008) have made
proposals regarding Indonesian -kan which may shed some light on the appropriate analysis of -agi. In Son & Cole (2008), they propose that -kan is a morphological reflex of a primitive semantic predicate RESULT, which they hypothesize is a part of the semantic event structure in the relevant construction.
They maintain that it is this RESULT head in the abstract structure that induces
the causative meaning as well as the endpoint of a path and so on. It is unclear
that -agi would be open to the same analysis inasmuch as instances of -agi in
causatives are not significantly greater than instances of -e in causatives. In
addition, Madurese contains the dedicated causative morpheme pa-.
In earlier work, Cole & Son (2004) propose a unified account of -kan as a
derivational morpheme affecting argument structure, specifically a morpheme
that licenses an argument in the argument structure that the base verb does not
itself license syntactically. As they note in their 2008 work, however, it is not
clear that argument structure is always affected, as in the case of -kan occurring
on the verb when the beneficiary is a prepositional object or in the case of the
specification of an endpoint. While it is not clear that this analysis can be applied part and parcel to -agi, aspects of it are appealing. A similar type of analysis in terms of argument structure and voice is entertained in section 4, but ultimately no unified analysis can be sustained.
3. Causatives
In most uses of -e and -agi, the semantic valence of a verb remains constant; the
change is in the alignment of semantic arguments with syntactic structure, specifically with core arguments. This is true with the use of -e with ditransitives,
verbs of communication, verbs of cognition, and so on, and the use of -agi with
most transitive verbs, verbs of communications, instrumental constructions, and
so on. However, data in sections 1.6 and 2.4 demonstrate that with some intransitive predicates in some instances affixation of -e or -agi changes the semantic
valence, licensing an additional argument of causation. However, neither is the
primary means of forming causative structures. The principal manner of forming morphological causatives is affixation of the causative prefix pa- (Chapter 4
section 1.1.7). In this section both synthetic (affixal) and periphrastic (syntactic)
causatives are detailed.
The majority of synthetic causatives take the prefix pa- as in (123b) and
(124b).","[331, 332]"
"216 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases
Modified adjectives obligatorily occur in a relative clause following the possessor, as in (163) where the modifier koros gallu ‘too skinny’ is grammatical
when in the relative clause (163a) but ungrammatical when occurring between
the noun and the possessor.
(163) a. Koceng-nga Nabun se koros gallu ngeco' juko'.
Nabun REL thin too AV.steal fish
cat-DEF
‘Nabun’s cat that is too skinny stole the fish.’
b. *Koceng koros gallu-na Nabun ngakan ngeco' juko'.
too-DEF
The ordering when the adjectival modifier is the predicate of a relative
clause is expected because a relative clause modifier must follow the possessor
of the head N (164) and (165). In the following examples, the relative clauses
are set off in square brackets.
(164) Embi'-na Budi [se ngekke' Ale']
e-pega'.
goat-DEF Budi REL AV.bite yngr.sibling OV-catch
‘Budi’s goat that bit Little Brother was caught.’
(165) Ebu
maca sorad-da Ina [se dhateng ba'ari'].
mother AV.read letter-DEF Ina REL come yesterday
‘Mother read Ina’s letter that came yesterday.’
A possessor always precedes a PP, whether the PP modifies the head N
directly (166a) and (167a) or as the predicate in a relative clause (166b) and
(167b).
(166) a. Hadi maca buku-na Bambang bab kopi.
Hadi AV.read book-DEF Bambang about coffee
‘Hadi read Bambang’s book about coffee.’
b. Hadi maca bukuna Bambang se bab kopi.
Hadi AV.read book-DEF Bambang REL about coffee
‘Hadi read Bambang’s book about coffee.’
(167) a. Mored-da Siti dhari Batam ce' penter-ra.
student-DEF Siti from Batam very smart-DEF
‘Siti’s student from Batam is very smart.’
b. Mored-da Siti se dhari Batam ce' penter-ra.
student-DEF Siti REL from Batam very smart-DEF
‘Siti’s student from Batam is very smart.’Constituent order in NPs 217Most speakers prefer the variants with the relative clause.
When an adjective cooccurs with a demonstrative, the adjective can either
precede or follow the demonstrative. When preceding the demonstrative, it can
occur as a bare attributive or in a relative clause (168a) and (169a), indicated by
the optionality of se. When following the demonstrative, the relative clause
structure is obligatory (168b) and (169b).
(168) a. Mored (se) penter rowa nerrossagi
dha' sakola'-an se
student REL smart that AV.continue-AGI to school-NOM REL
lebbi tenggi.
more high
‘That smart student is going to university.’
b. Mored rowa se penter nerrossagi
dha' sakola'an se
student that REL smart AV.continue-AGI to school-NOM REL
lebbi tenggi.
more high
‘That smart student is going to university.’
(169) a. Sengko' coma nyango gagaman (se) clannok reya.
I
only AV.bring weapon REL curved this
‘I only brought this curved weapon.’ (an are', a scythe)
b. Sengko' coma nyango gagaman reya se clannok.
I
only AV.bring weapon this REL curved
‘I only brought this curved weapon.’
There are additional ordering possibilities with multiple adjectives and a demonstrative: both adjectives can occur as bare attributives preceding the demonstrative (170a), one bare attributive adjective and an adjective in a relative
clause can precede the demonstrative (170b), and the adjectives can be conjoined and precede the demonstrative (optionally in a relative clause (170c).
(170) a. Koceng celleng koros juwa lo' tedhung.
cat
black thin that not sleep
‘The skinny black cat is not asleep.’
b. Koceng celleng se koros juwa lo' tedhung.
cat
black REL thin that not sleep
‘The skinny black cat is not asleep.’218 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases
c. Koceng (se) celleng ban koros juwa lo' tedhung.
REL black and thin that not sleep
cat
‘The skinny black cat is not asleep.’
When one attributive adjective precedes the demonstrative and one in a relative
follows (171a), and when the adjectives can occur as the conjoined predicate of
a relative clause following the demonstrative (171b), the noun phrase is interpreted as denoting more than one cat.
(171) a. Koceng celleng juwa se koros lo' tedhung.
cat
black that REL thin not sleep
‘The black cat that is skinny a not asleep.’ (The others are awake)
b. Koceng juwa se celleng ban koros lo' tedhung.
cat
that REL black and thin not sleep
‘The cats that are the skinny one and the thin one are not asleep.’
The possible orderings of the demonstrative and the relative clause containing adjectival predicates is expected as other types of relative clauses can
either precede (172a) or follow (172b) the demonstrative when there is also an
adjectival modifier.
(172) a. Ita ban Ina maca buku tebbel rowa se e-belli Syamsiah.
Ita and Ina AV.read book thick that REL OV-buy Syamsiah
‘Ita and Ina read those thick books that Syamsiah bought.’
b. Ita ban Ina maca buku tebbel se e-belli Syamsiah rowa .
Ita and Ina AV.read book thick REL OV-buy Syamsiah that
‘Ita and Ina read those thick books that Syamsiah bought.’
PP modifiers can either precede or follow the demonstrative, optionally
occurring in a relative clause in either position.
(173) a. Kana' (se) dhari Sumennep rowa kennal ka Tina.
child REL from Sumenep that know to Tina
‘That kid from Sumenep knows Tina.’
b. Kana' rowa (se) dhari Sumennep, kennal ka Tina.
child that REL from Sumenep know to Tina
‘That kid from Sumenep knows Tina.’Constituent order in NPs 219In (173a) the prepositional phrase or relative clause precedes the demonstrative
rowa, and in (173b) the same constituent follows rowa. The sentences in (174)
provide additional examples.
(174) a. Sengko' la
maca buku (se) bab basa
Madura rowa.
I
already AV.read book REL about language Madura that
‘I read that book about Madurese.’
b. Sengko' la
maca buku rowa (se) bab basa
Madura.
I
already AV.read book that REL about language Madura
‘I read that book about Madurese.’
Having adjectival, PP, and demonstrative modifiers presents an array of
possible combinations of orders. (Some speakers prefer to pause where there are
commas in the following examples.)
(175) a. Mored penter dhari Batam rowa noles
buku reya.
student smart from Batam that AV.write book this
‘That smart student from Batam wrote the book.’
b. Mored penter rowa, (se) dhari Batam noles buku reya.
REL from Batam AV.write book this
student smart that
‘That smart student from Batam wrote the book.’
c. Mored dhari Batam se penter rowa noles buku reya.
student from Batam REL smart that AV.write book this
‘That smart student from Batam wrote the book.’
d. Mored rowa se penter bi' se dhari Batam noles
buku reya.
student that REL smart and REL from Batam AV.write book this
‘That smart student from Batam wrote the book.’
In (175a) the order of elements in the NP is N (mored ‘student’), adjective (penter ‘smart’), PP (dhari Batam ‘from Batam’), demonstrative (rowa ‘that’). In
(175b), the demonstrative precedes the PP, which optionally occurs in a relative
clause (se dhari Batam). In (175c), the PP modifier directly follows the head N
and precedes a relative clause containing the adjective (se penter), followed by
the demonstrative. In (175d), the adjective and the PP occur in separate coordinated relative clauses (se penter bi' se dhari Batam) following the demonstrative. For some speakers, the structure in (175d) forces an interpretation of there
being two different students, ‘the one who is smart and the one who is from
Batam’.
A number of other possible combinations of modifiers and their possible220 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases
orderings follow. In an NP containing PP and relative clause modifiers with a
demonstrative, the relative clause usually follows the PP and precedes the demonstrative (176a). For some speakers the relative clause can follow the demonstrative (176b), but other speakers reject this structure, and for those who
accept it, (176a) is preferred.
(176) a. Ita ban Ina maca buku bab kopi se e-belli Syamsiah rowa.
Ita and Ina AV.read book about coffee REL OV-buy Syamsiah that
‘Ita and Ina read that book about coffee that Syamsiah bought.’
b. %Ita ban Ina maca buku bab kopi rowa se e-belli Syamsiah.
Ita and Ina AV.read book about coffee that REL OV-buy Syamsiah
‘Ita and Ina read that book about coffee that Syamsiah bought.’
When the NP includes adjectival and PP modifiers, a possessor, and a demonstrative, there are a host of possibilities. The examples in (177) illustrate the
structure when the option to have the adjective precede the possessor is taken.
In this case the order N-Adj-Poss-PP-Dem is possible (177a), as is the order NAdj-Poss-Dem-PP (177b).7
(177) a. Sengko' a-temmo kanca tenggi-na Tina dhari Sumennep rowa.
AV-meet friend tall-DEF Tina from Sumenep that
I
‘I met that tall friend of Tina’s from Sumenep.’
b. Sengko' a-temmo kanca tenggi-na Tina rowa dhari Sumennep.
AV-meet friend tall-DEF Tina that from Sumenep
I
‘I met that tall friend of Tina’s from Sumenep.’
With possessor NPs, numerals behave as expected, occurring in either
NP-initial position (178a) or NP-final position (178b). As before, in NP-final
position the numeral occurs in reduplicated form. The structure with the NPinitial numeral (178a) is preferred by speakers of the Western dialect; the NPfinal reduplicated structure (178b) is commonly viewed as a structure used in
the Eastern dialect.
(178) a. Pettong mored-da Pa' Hadi bakal lulus tes.
seven student-DEF Mr Hadi will pass test
‘Pak Hadi’s seven students will pass the test.’7Some speakers reject these structures as having too much information packed into a
single noun phrase and would use multiple sentences or phrases to convey the
information.","[232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237]"
"Chapter 13
AnaphoraThis chapter describes the structure and use of various anaphoric expressions,
including reflexives (section 1), reciprocals (section 2), and various types of
null pronouns and null anaphors (sections 3-5). As the pronominal forms of
Madurese are detailed in Chapter 3 section 3 and more extensively in Chapter 7
section 3, they are not treated here.
1. Reflexives
Reflexive meaning is primarily expressed by means of the word dibi', which
means ‘alone’ or ‘only’. This is reflected in sentences such as (1) and (2).
(1)Rika ngennal-lagi aba'na dibi' ka Evi.
to Evi
Rika AV.know-AGI
‘Rika introduced herself to Evi.’(2)Ali a-careta bab aba'na dibi' ka Hadi.
to Hadi
Ali AV-story about
‘Ali told Hadi about himself.’In both (1) and (2), the complex form aba'na dibi' corefers with the subject,
Rika and Ali, respectively. The complex form is made up of the third person
pronoun aba'na and dibi', looking very much like the complex forms herself
and himself in English. As described in Chapter 7 section 7.3, aba'na is itself a
complex form made up of aba' ‘body, soul’ and the definite suffix -na. Thus, in
dialects making use of aba'eng, aba'eng dibi' is also fully acceptable.
(3)Dhokter juwa mareksa
aba'eng dibi'.
doctor that AV.examine
‘The doctor examined herself.’Reflexives for first and second persons can be formed through the use of
aba'na dibi', (4a) and (5a), or can be marked simply with aba', as in (4b) and
(5b), an instance of using a plain pronoun to mark reflexive (see section 1.3).","[432, 433, 434]"

The list includes cases in which high vowels follow voiceless consonants, as in
[buku] ‘book’, [kɔpi] ‘coffee’, [kibik] ‘cubic’, [susu] ‘milk’, and [ipəs]
‘typhus’. There are also instances in which a non-high vowel follows a voiced
stop, such as [ban] ‘tire’, [ba] ‘bank’, [bla] ‘ball’, and [gɔbis] ‘cabbage’. The
only high vowels that are found in such lexical items are [u] and [i]; [ɨ] and [ɤ]
are never found outside the conditioning environment for vowel alternation.
There is another important difference among [u], [i], [ɨ], and [ɤ]: [u] and
[i] occur word-initially in a small number of lexical items (32), whereas [ɨ] and
[ɤ] never do.

(i) [susu] ~ [sɔsɔ] ‘milk’
[tulɛn] ~ [tɔlɛn] ‘pure’
[tulus] ~ [tɔlɔs] ‘reliable’Vowel inventory and distribution 37In order to account for these instances of [i] and [u] outside the conditioning
environment, they must be posited in underlying representations. It is never necessary to posit [ɨ] and [ɤ] in underlying representations of lexical items. As the
occurrence of [ɨ] and [ɤ] can always be predicted, there is no need to include
them in the phonemic inventory of the language.
Having established the vowel harmony (or raising or tensing) process and
the phonemic inventory as the six vowels /ɛ/, /ɔ/, /a/, /ə/, /i/, and /u/, it is clear
this should be reflected in the underlying representations of lexical items. Thus,
we have the following:
(33) underlying
/kɛpa/
/ɛa/ 
/pəkkəl/
/cɔkɔ/
/kɔrɛ/surface
[kipɤ] ‘carry’
iɤ ‘remain’
[pəkkɨl] ‘angry’
[cukɔ] ‘fish’
[kuri] ‘fry’All of the high vowels in the surface forms are derived via the harmony rule. In
words with non-alternating vowels, the surface and underlying forms are identical. However, in order to focus discussion and make forms maximally transparent, I include the surface form of the vowels in all roots.
A final issue regarding the vowel inventory is the status of [] as a surface
vowel. In works such as Stevens (1980, 1994) and Cohn & Lockwood (1994),
eight vowels are posited as being the principle vowels in Madurese, the eight
described above as participating in the vowel alternation. However, other
sources differ on the number of primary vowels. (I use the term ‘primary vowels’ here as the authors tend not to identify the inventories as being phonemic
or phonetic.) Budi et al. (1986/1987) recognize seven vowels, as do Safioedin
(1977) and Zainudin (1978). While there seems to be some conflation of [ə], [ɤ]
and [ɨ] in Budi et al., Safioden (1977), Zainudin (1978), and Pawitra (2009) posit [i], [ɛ], [u], [ɔ], [a], [ə], and [ɤ] (although transcription systems vary somewhat). Moehnilabib (1979) recognizes six vowels, corresponding to the phonemic inventory posited here. Notably absent in all but Stevens and Cohn &
Lockwood is any distinction between [ə] and [ɨ]. And, in fact, no practical orthography ever devised for Madurese has ever recognized such a distinction
(see section 8). Those that make use of symbols other than a, e, i, o, u identify
six or seven graphemes but never include a distinct symbol for [].
What, then, is the status of [ɨ]? It might be recognized for theoretical reasons, i.e. to regularize the system of alternating vowels. However, absent other
evidence, ensuring paradigm uniformity for the alternating vowel system seems
an insufficient justification. There does, however, appear to be some instrumental evidence for distinguishing [ə] and [ɨ]. Cohn & Lockwood (1994) report that38 Chapter 2 Phonology
the analysis of recordings of one male and one female speaker from East Madura indicate the vowel space (based on first and second formants) occupied by [ɨ]
is distinct from that of [ə]. At the same time, the difference in the vowel space
that they report for [ə] and [ɨ] is much less dramatic than the differences for the
other pairs, and indeed there was some overlap in their distribution. The space
occupied by each of the vowels in the other pairs was essentially completely
distinct from its partner. Cohn & Lockwood found little difference in the average F2s of the pair of vowels but found the difference between the average F1s
to be comparable for [i]/[ɛ], [u]/[ɔ] and [ɨ]/[ə] (the difference in the F1 averages
for [ɤ]/[a] were dramatically higher). In attempting to replicate these results
with a single male speaker from Jember, East Java, Bortscheller (2007) reports a
somewhat more dramatic difference in the vowel space occupied by [ə] and [ɨ].
He also reports a slightly greater difference between the average F1s for [ə] and
[ɨ] than found by Cohn & Lockwood for their male speaker. But again, the difference in average F1 is comparable to that found with the other pairs of vowels. While not a matter of great urgency, given the instrumental evidence (albeit slim), it seems that the distinction should be recognized.
4.2. Other vowel processes
Finally, there are three low-level phonetic processes that have been proposed for
some apparent tense/lax allophonic variation and a vowel nasalization process.
The first is a rule that alters the quality of a high front or high back vowel in
closed syllables, accounting for perceived instances of [] and []. Stevens
(1968) cites this rule, and the reflexes ] and [] are included in Safioedin
(1977) and Oka et al. (1988/89). Potential examples include:
(34) [] ~ [n] ‘star’
[kippɔn] ~ [kppɔn] ‘confused’
[buntɔ] ~ [bʊntɔ] ‘tail’
Cohn & Lockwood (1994) report that for the two speakers they studied, high
front and high back vowels were significantly shorter in duration in closed syllables than in open syllables. They reported no significant differences in the F1
and F2 values in the same environments. I have been able to confirm these results to some degree through acoustic analysis of data collected from four
speakers.22 There were no significant differences in the F1 and F2 values in
open and closed syllables, but there was some difference in vowel length. These
22Three speakers were recorded on Madura and one speaker originally from Situbundo
(East Java) was recorded in Iowa City. Thanks to Michael Bortscheller, Craig Dresser,
and Jeff Press for assistance with the acoustic analysis.","[52, 53, 54, 55]"

As indicated by the single and double underscoring, Dewi Ratnadi is using alos
vocabulary in addressing her husband, Joko Tole, and he responds to her in
kasar. Additionally, in the first line of the second passage, Dewi Ratnadi using
the alos tenggi word pareng ‘give’ as the person doing the giving was a man
older than herself.
A text published sometime during the early 20th century (Keizer n.d.)
illustrates a different state of affairs. In this instance, the wife (B) speaks to the
man, a laborer in a factory, using tengnga'an and the husband, Pa' Arsik (PA),
responds in kasar. Pa' Arsik is ill and tells his wife of his plan to go to the hospital (with the help of his boss).

Earlier in the story, the princess is speaking with her father, Pangeran
Saca Diningrat (PSD), the King of Bana Sare. In this interaction the daughter
uses alos and the king responds in kasar. The king is trying to cajole his daughter into getting married.

While this passage includes fewer level-specific words, where they are used, the
princess addresses her father in alos and he responds in kasar. Note also the use
of the alos tenggi kai by the princess as a term of address to her father.
The use of alos, kasar, and tengnga'an in familial relationships is illustrated with two passages from Campaka (Imron 1979). In the first, Bu' Randha
(BR) is speaking with her son Campaka (C), who asks for money in order to
meet with friends in town. Campaka addresses his mother using alos and Bu'

Here Campaka uses the alos word obang ‘money’ and his mother uses the kasar
pesse in her response. Note also Campaka’s use of the alos mandhap nyo'on
‘request’ (rather than the biyasa menta) as is appropriate since the person of
lower status is making a request to a person of higher status. When he finds his
brother (A) in the market, the following interchange takes place.

‘Yes, I know indeed that you got rid of the monkey. Now listen to me!’In this exchange between brothers , the younger brother addresses Campaka, his
older brother, using tengnga'an nape ‘what’ and bula ‘I’ as a moderate show of
respect for the difference in age. Campaka, as the older speaking to the younger
brother, responds in kasar (as indicated by the underscored words in the second
sentence).
A shift of levels within a single dialogue is illustrated in the following
passage from Ke Moko. In it, the King of Palembang is offering a Makassarese
trader his daughter’s hand in marriage as a reward for the trader’s helping rid
the kingdom of disease. Earlier in the story, Rato Palembang (RP) addresses the
trader in kasar. But in this passage the king shifts to tengnga'an speech and in
the following line alos. This entire passage indicates first the change in their
relationship (from king/commoner to father-in-law and son-in-law) and second
the understanding of the special powers of the trader (which he developed
through his kiai, Ke Moko).

‘But first you must give an engagement gift.’
In the first line, the king uses the tengnga'an pronouns dika ‘you’ and bula ‘I’
(marked by the dotted underscore). In the next line, the king shifts to the alos
pronoun sampeyan and refers to the action of giving by the Makassarese trader,
the addressee, using the alos tenggi pareng ‘give’. This passage marks the shift
in the relationship between the two men from the perspective of the king.
Finally, in a dialogue among acquaintances of equal status, such as the
two cousins Tandha Anggre' and Tandha Serrat (from the story of the same
name), kasar is used throughout. In this passage Tandha Serrat challengesImplementation of the speech levels 487Tandha Serrat to a cock fight to determine who will actually wed Sare Bate, the

4. Implementation of the speech levels
Though the foregoing discussion has depicted the language level system as relatively stable or ‘consistent’, as stated above, this is an idealization. The actual
use of the system of status vocabularies was executed to varying degrees among
different social classes in different settings. Today this is true more so than ever.
In many instances among those of lower social status, mastery of the vocabularies was incomplete at best and inconsistently applied. Poedjosoedarmo
(2006) reports for this for Javanese as well. The higher one’s social rank and
level of education, the more likely one was to have mastered the respect vocabularies and the situations in which each would be considered appropriate. Ad-488 Chapter 15 Speech levels
ditionally, speakers report that the proper use of the vocabularies was more
rigorously adhered to in certain social relationships, citing the importance of
students addressing their teachers and santri addressing their kiai using alos
vocabulary.
The situations in which each vocabulary was to be employed was at times
subject to some variation as well. Outside of some specific examples such as
student to teacher and others like it, there is not always agreement among
speakers regarding what situation calls for what level of politeness. Two sources
note that (in past times) husbands would address their wives in tengnga'an (Stevens 1966, Muakmam 2007), while others have reported that husbands would
address their wives in kasar. At any rate, this appears to no longer be the case,
and spouses regularly use kasar with one another.9 Some report, however, that
some higher frequency alos words (e.g. asaren ‘sleep’ rather than tedhung and
neddha ‘eat’ rather than ngakan) might be employed to increase the level of
politeness.
Variation also took place in the completeness of the vocabulary used. In
many instances, children would mainly use kasar vocabulary with their parents,
but again would integrate higher frequency alos lexical items. And as Stevens
(1966) notes, many aspects of language are subject to change and there has been
and can be expected to be such changes in the respect vocabularies. He cites, on
the one hand, alos tenggi words becoming alos, and thus being used to refer to
the first person. In some ways this is not entirely surprising as in practical terms
many Madurese speakers do not differentiate the alos and alos tenggi vocabularies, simply using the label alos.10 This is not to imply that they do not under
stand that some alos words are used only in reference to third and second persons of higher rank; they do. It simply indicates that using a single label could
well improve the chances of such a shift. Stevens (1966) identifies shifts in social factors as having perhaps a greater impact on the implementation of the
speech levels, citing a tendency for familiarity to replace status as a criterion–
kasar tending to be used between well acquainted people regardless of rank (e.g.
children to adult family friends) and alos with unfamiliar people regardless of
social rank.
There was evidence of these shifts over 40 years ago, when Stevens made
his observations, and the trend has only accelerated. Many societal factors have
exacerbated this, including: the increased use of Indonesian (a language without
the intricate respect vocabularies) in everyday life, the use of Indonesian in
9But see Muakmam (2007) for a different view of the currency of the practice.
Muakman (2007) does identify some alos lexical items as ka oreng laen 'to other
people' (alos tenggi) and others as ka aba' dibi' 'to oneself' (alos mandhap), but includes
only some 16 lexical meanings in the alos tenggi set. Additionally, some items in his ka
aba' dibi' set would not be classified as alos mandhap but clearly fit his category of
words that would refer to the self (as well as others of non-honorific status).
10Implementation of the speech levels 489educational settings and a de-emphasis of using and teaching the local language
in school, a tendency toward leveling class distinctions in a democratic society
(including the influence of some aspects of Western society), and other factors
(including what some older adults see as ‘laziness’ on the part of the younger
generation). At any rate, this trend affects the use of respect vocabulary not only
in Madurese, but in Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese as well. Poedjosoedarmo
(2006) notes that in the case of Javanese (i) an increased number of welleducated speakers confuse the Krama Inggil (= alos tenggi) and Krama Andhap
(= alos mandhap) pairs, (ii) more younger Javanese speakers have greatly reduced vocabularies compared to their elders, and (iii) speakers are cognizant of
the fact that they do not control the respect vocabularies and opt to use Indonesian instead. These observations are undoubtedly applicable to the case of Madurese and other related languages as well.","[499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506]"
"100 Chapter 4 Morphology
As discussed in Chapter 3, whether these should be considered noun roots or
precategorial roots is open to debate. Regardless, affixation of ng- to this class
of roots derives an actor voice verb.
Related to this last set are cases in which ng- is affixed to noun roots denoting an occupation or workplace, as in
(10) root
barung ‘small shop’
tokang ‘artisan’
sopir ‘driver’
toko ‘store’actor voice
marung ‘run a barung’
nokang ‘work as an artisan’
nyopir ‘work as a driver’
noko ‘run a store’Also related are cases in ng- is affixed to nouns (and some adjectives) and
derives a verb which means ‘be like’.
(11) beddhi ‘sand’
caceng ‘worm’meddhi ‘be gritty’
nyaceng ‘be scrawny’These derivatives seem distinct from the other examples, which are clearly
agentive. However, interpreting nyaceng as ‘be scrawny’ may be a semantic
narrowing of the conceivable, more general interpretation ‘act like a worm’,
similar to nyake’ ‘act sick’ in (13).
Finally, there are a few specialized cases of verbs derived from noun roots
with ng-.
(12) root
teppe ‘edge’
sese ‘edge/side’
penggir ‘edge’
pettong are ‘7th day
ceremony’actor voice
neppe ‘go along the edge’
nyese ‘give way’
menggir ‘step aside’
mettong are ‘hold a 7th day ceremony’Affixed to adjectival roots, ng- again derives a verb meaning ‘displaying
the quality of’ or ‘be/act like’.
(13) root
songar ‘conceited’
sala ‘wrong’
seppe ‘quiet’
sake' ‘sick’actor voice
nyongar ‘act conceited’
nyala ‘make a mistake’
nyeppe ‘grow quiet’
nyake' ‘act sick’Affixation 1011.1.2. Actor voice a-, /a/
The actor voice prefix a- works in much the same way as ng- to derive verbs in
the actor voice. Many active intransitive and some active transitive verb roots
take the a- prefix.
(14) root
bala ‘say’
lonca' ‘jump’
berka' ‘run’
jelling ‘watch’
berri’ ‘give’actor voice
abala
alonca'
aberka'
ajelling
aberri’Verbs are derived from a variety of nominal (or precategorial) roots. Some are
instruments or locations for (work).
(15) root
sapedha ‘bicycle’
jala ‘net’
motor ‘car’
saba ‘rice paddy’
tane ‘farm’
sakola ‘school’actor voice
asapedha ‘ride a bicycle’
ajala ‘fish with a net’
amotor ‘ride in a car’
asaba ‘work in a rice paddy’
atane ‘farm’
asakola ‘go to school’This derivation is quite common for articles of clothing.
(16) root
sapatu ‘shoe’
sorban ‘turbin’
kalambi ‘shirt’
kaos ‘t-shirt’actor voice
asapatu ‘wear shoes’
asorban ‘wear a turbin’
akalambi ‘wear a shirt’
akaos ‘wear a t-shirt’Affixing the iterative -an to any of these indicates that the subject regularly/habitually wears this item of clothing, e.g. akaosan ‘usually wear a t-shirt’.
The iterative suffix is discussed in section 1.1.9.
Verbs indicating that an action has been performed or in some cases is in
the process of being performed take the a- prefix. The state of affairs described
is explicitly agentless, which makes these quite different from other uses of a-,
and the meaning is a stative result of an action. There is an inchoative quality to
these although they differ from predicates taking prefix ka-, discussed in section
1.1.5, which also sometimes have an inchoative quality.","[116, 117, 118]"
"Affixation 991.1. Verbal morphology
One of the most salient properties of Madurese morphology is the voice system,
morphology that indicates the relationship of thematic roles and grammatical
functions. Madurese voice is discussed in detail in Chapter 9. The purpose here
is to simply present the morphological manifestations.
1.1.1. Actor voice ng-, //
The prefix ng-, and its morphophonological variants, signals actor voice or active voice verbs, used when the actor is the subject of the sentence. It is affixed
directly to verb roots, as in
(7)root
enom ‘drink’
kerem ‘send’
baca ‘read’
teggu ‘watch’actor voice
ngenom
ngerem
maca
negguWhen affixed to roots denoting instruments, the resulting verb means ‘to use
instrument’.3
(8)root

pacol ‘hoe’
tokol ‘hammer’
kaca ‘glass, mirror’actor voice
ngare’ ‘cut with a scythe’
macol ‘hoe’
nokol ‘hammer’
ngaca ‘look in a mirror’Very closely related to this is the use of the actor voice with different types of
food and drink to denote the process of making that food or drink.
(9)root
kopi ‘coffee’
tajjin ‘porridge’

cao ‘climbing plant’3actor voice
ngopi ‘make coffee’ (can also be used to
denote ‘drink coffee’)
najjin ‘make porridge’
ngolek ‘stew bananas’
nyao ‘make a drink from cao plant’Potentially these are precategorial roots. See Chapter 3 section 1.4 for discussion of
precategorial roots.","[115, 116]"
"As stated above, Madura itself presents a somewhat inhospitable environment. Compared to the fertile soil and abundant rainfall characteristic of
Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan, Madura receives far less rainfall and has poor
chalky soil. This results in extremely unfavorable conditions for agriculture and
an inability to sustain a large population. Maize was traditionally the principal
crop, supplemented by beans and some other vegetable crops. Raising livestock
has been critical to the subsistence economy, particularly cattle and goats. (The
Madurese are well-known for the tradition of kerapan sape ‘bull racing’, and
the annual event draws spectators to the island from a wide region. A description of the tradition is included in the texts in Chapter 16.) Given the conditions
present on the island, a tradition of fishing and seafaring developed, and many
Madurese became traders. Those Madurese who migrated to Java and other
parts of Indonesia (to escape these conditions on Madura) largely worked as
laborers and food vendors.
The tradition of trading created close ties with the pasisir kingdoms on
the northern coast of Java, and these ties were important in the rapid introduction of Islam to Madura in the early 16th century. This was hastened further by a
political system which made the more egalitarian religion of Islam particularly
appealing to the large proportion of the population that did not belong to the
nobility in the courts of the three principal kingdoms of Sumenep, Pamekasan,
and Bangkalan. According to Mansurnoor (1990), as Islam spread, the religious
leaders, the kyai, increasingly assumed positions of standing and some power as
the kings, the rato, recognized the wisdom of officially embracing the popular4 Chapter 1 Introduction
religious leaders as a way of maintaining their power. Subsequently, when the
rato were stripped of their power by the Dutch in the late 1800’s, the kyai filled
the leadership vacuum and became a central focus of authority in the various
villages and larger governmental units, thus taking on an important role in the
governance system. As a result, the Madurese people are almost entirely Muslim, with an admixture of local customs, and a strong commitment to Islam is at
the core of the Madurese identity and their lives. Traditionally, daily life in the
villages in the countryside and enclaves in larger cities revolved around an Islamic center, under the leadership of an ulama or kyai, and the associated boarding school, pesantren, played a pivotal role in society, particularly to the education of young Madurese men, and does so in many Madurese communities
throughout Jawa Timur today. Of course, with rapid transitions in modern Indonesian society, any sweeping generalization is difficult to maintain.
However, sweeping generalizations and stereotypes have for centuries
plagued the Madurese and play a critical role in understanding their position in
Indonesian society. The hard and uncertain livelihood and difficult conditions
on Madura resulted in a tough-minded temperament and independent character,
a character infused with fealty to family, friends, and leaders. A tendency toward straightforward, direct expression has generally been viewed as less refined and polite by some other groups, particularly on the main island of Java–
this despite the fact that the Madurese language shares with Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, and some other languages of the area the intricate system of
politeness vocabularies and rules for their use commonly referred to as ‘speech
levels’ (described in Chapter 15). But this reputation for straightforward expression, combined with the tradition of carok (a system of ritualized violent vengeance operating outside of the recognized legal system4) has created a situation
succinctly summed up by de Jonge (1995:7), “There are few ethnic groups in
the Indonesian archipelago about whom as many negative and equivocal stereotypes exist as about the Madurese...it is striking that the current image of the
suku Madura [‘Madurese tribe’] in Indonesia today hardly differs from the one
present during the colonial period.” As described below, this has contributed to
what has been until relatively recently as relatively small Western literature on
the Madurese people and their language.
2. The language
Madurese is a member of the Malayo-Sumbawan subgroup of the West
ern Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family (Adelaar
2005; Gray, Drummond and Greenhill 2009). Western Malayo-Polynesian in4See Smith 1997, van Dijk 2002, and Wiyata 2002 for descriptions and discussion of

b. Tokol kaju rowa!
hammer wood that
‘Hammer that board!’
In (1a) tokol ‘hammer’ is used nominally, an object that can be possessed. In
(1b) tokol occurs as the imperative verb in precisely the same form. Thus, based
solely on these sentences, it is impossible to determine whether tokol is a noun
root or a verb root. Of course, one can say exactly the same of the word ‘hammer’ in the English sentences in the translations. Thus, this particular example
is not very revealing. However, leaving aside potentially precategorial roots
(which are taken up in section 1.4), establishing a distinction between nouns
and verbs (and adjectives) is relatively straightforward.
1.1. The category noun
The need for a category noun as opposed to verbs and adjectives can be established on morphological as well as syntactic grounds.
Morphologically, only nouns can occur with the prefix sa-, which means
‘all X’, ‘same X’ or ‘one X’. From the set in (2) bengko ‘house’, saba ‘field’,
and bapa' ‘father’, prototypical nominal concepts, can be distinguished from the
other roots, which denote actions and states, prototypically verbal and adjectival
notions.

kene’‘smart’
‘small’*sapenter
*sakene'Considering the paradigm, which can be replicated manyfold, sa- emerges as a
diagnostic of the category noun. In order for any of the other roots to occur with
the sa- prefix, derivational morphology must occur as well, morphology which
typically derives nouns. So, while toles and penter cannot occur with sa-, derived nominals based on them can. In (3), the suffix -an derives a result nominal
and the circumfix ka-...-an derives an abstract noun.
(3)tolesan
‘writing’
satolesan
‘all the writing’
kapenterran ‘intelligence’ sakapenterran ‘all of the intelligence’The fact that only derived forms of these roots can take sa- corroborates its usefulness as a diagnostic for nouns.
While this is really the only clear morphological test for nouns, there are
syntactic tests as well. First, of the open lexical classes only nouns can be negated with the morpheme banne ‘no’.

A handful of temporal expressions fall outside the nominal and adjectival
classes, and these can simply be categorized as adverbs. These include expressions such as buru ‘recently’, ella ‘already’ (usually in its truncated form la), gi'
‘still, yet’, kene ‘now’, na'an ‘soon’, and sateya ‘now’, as exemplified in (7)
and (8).
(7)Mon gi' ngoda barna-na biru. 

Madura, se a-nyama are' otaba are' Madura.
are' Madura
Madura REL AV-name are' or
‘Now I am going to tell you about the weapon of the Madurese, which is
called are' or are' Madura.’When used temporally, buru, gi', and la generally (though not obligatorily)
occur in the immediate preverbal slot, where they function like auxiliaries. (See
discussion in Chapter 9 section 4.)
There is considerable freedom in the position of temporal expressions in a
clause. For instance, in the clause in (10), for many speakers only the position
between the verb and NP object is considered completely unacceptable (10e),
although some speakers accept this as well.
(10) a. Marlena noles
sorat ka Ita, ba'ari.
Marlena AV.write letter to Ita yesterday
‘Marlena wrote a letter to Ita yesterday.’
b. Ba'ari, Marlena noles sorat ka Ita.
c. Marlena ba'ari, noles sorat ka Ita.
d. Marlena noles sorat ba'ari, ka Ita.
e. *Marlena noles ba'ari, sorat ka Ita.
Though clause-final position (10a) is perhaps the most preferred, these temporal
expressions are frequently found in clause-initial position (10b) and immediately following the subject (10c). Many speakers consider (10d) to be acceptable
but not preferred with a slight pause following ba'ari, while others consider it
ungrammatical. Here ba'ari follows the direct object sorat ‘letter’ and precedes
the PP indirect object ka Ita ‘to Ita’. The same pattern of facts obtains with saminggu tapongkor ‘last week’ in (11).
(11) a. Karim nyaba' motor e seddi'-na roma-na sa-minggu se tapongkor.
at side-DEF house-DEF one-week REL behind
Karim AV.put car
‘Karim put the car beside the house a week ago.’392 Chapter 12 Adverbs and adverbial clauses
b. Sa-minggu se tapongkor, Karim nyaba' motor e seddi'-na roma-na.
c. Karim sa-minggu se tapongkor, nyaba' motor e seddi'-na roma-na.
d. Karim nyaba' motor sa-minggu se tapongkor, e seddi'-na roma-na.
e. *Karim nyaba' sa-minggu se tapongkor, motor e seddi'-na roma-na.
Again, many speakers consider (11e) unacceptable or degraded.
A number of temporal expressions such as sabaktona ‘when (at the time
of)’, sabellunna ‘before’, sa'ellana ‘after’, and samarena ‘after’ are derived
nominals. They are comprised of the clitic sa ‘1/all’, a root, and the definite
suffix -na. Thus, samarena, made up of sa + mare ‘finish’ + na. Examples are
in (12) and (13).
(12) Daggi' samarena pettong are so engko' samper-ra e-bagi dha' ba'eng.

cloth-DEF OV-give to you
‘Later after seven days I am going to give you the cloth.’
(13) Bapa' dhapa' neng kantor sabellunna kol ballu'.
father arrive at
office before
strike eight
‘Father gets to the office before eight o’clock.’
The sa + root + na derivatives frequently introduce clauses, functioning as subordinating conjunctions. See section 3.5 for further discussion of this highly
productive structure.
1.2. Frequency adverbs
How often a state of affairs obtains can be expressed by a small number of
words and phrases, including: biyasana ‘usually’, dangkadang ‘sometimes’,
poampo ‘sometimes’, li-baliyan ‘several times’, pan-barampan kale ‘several
times’, rangrang ‘seldom’, (sa)bakto-bakto ‘sometimes’, and seggut ‘often’, as
illustrated in (14) and (15).
(14) Ali rangrang mangkat ka sakola sabellunna kol ennem.
Ali seldom leave
to school before
strike six
‘Ali seldom leaves for school before six o’clock.’
(15) Bapa' seggut maca koran
kaangguy Ebu'.
mother
father often AV.read newspaper for
‘Father often reads the newspaper to Mother.’Types of adverbial expressions 393In (14) and (15), the frequency adverbs rangrang ‘seldom’ and seggut ‘often’
occur in immediate preverbal position, the preferred position for frequency adverbs.
Along with rangrang and seggut, poampo and dangkadang are underived
adverbs (or at least obligatorily reduplicated roots). Others of the frequency
adverbs are derived forms. Biyasana ‘usually’ is a nominal form derived by
affixing the definite suffix to biyasa ‘usual’. Li-baliyan ‘several times’ is derived by reduplication of the verbal root bali ‘return’ and affixation of -an, both
processes frequently encountered in adverb formation. Li-baliyan literally
means ‘back and forth’. The NP pan-barampan kale is made up of the quantifier pan-barampan ‘several’ and kale ‘time’. The frequency adverbs are also
quite commonly found in preverbal position.
(16) Bambang biyasana ngenom kopi gi' laggu.
Bambang usually AV.drink coffee still morning
‘Bambang usually drinks coffee in the early morning.’
While the preverbal position is a preferred position, frequency adverbs
often occur in clause-initial position, although some speakers reject seggut ‘often’ and rangrang ‘seldom’ here.
(17) Dangkadang/Li-baliyan/Biyasana/Seggut,Bapa' a-lombur.
sometimes/several times/usually/often
father AV-overtime
‘Sometimes/Many times/Usually Father works overtime.’
Li-baliyan and pan-barampan kale easily occur clause-finally as well.
(18) Ale'
maca buku rowa li-baliyan/pan-barampan kale.
time
yngr.sibling AV.read book that several
‘Little Sister has read that book several times.’
Most of the other frequency adverbs resist clause-final position, but can sometimes occur there with a significant pause preceding them.
1.3. Epistemic adverbials
Epistemic expressions signal the speaker’s attitude about a particular proposition–the degree of their certainty, doubt, equivocation, and so on toward that
proposition. The forms in Madurese are largely adjectival expressions and
nouns derived from adjectives. These include ara ‘possible’, dadak ‘sudden’,
emana ‘unfortunate’, megga' ‘possible’, onggu ‘definite’, pola ‘possible’, mompong ‘maybe’, ga-moga ‘hopefully’ (moga ‘hopeful’), saongguna ‘apparently’,394 Chapter 12 Adverbs and adverbial clauses
tantona ‘certainty’, and others. Examples are given in (19) and (20).
(19) Hadi ban Hamina saongguna entar ka Sumatera.
Hadi and Hamina apparently go
to Sumatra
‘Hadi and Hamina apparently went to Sumatra.’
(20) Siti pola
lo' mare sasssa'-an-na.
Siti probably not finish wash-NOM-DEF
‘Siti probably didn’t finish the laundry.’
Again, epistemic expressions generally occur in preverbal position. However,
they can also occur naturally in clause-initial position.
(21) Saongguna Hadi ban Hamina entar ka Sumatera.
apparently Hadi and Hamina go to Sumatra
‘Apparently Hadi and Hamina went to Sumatra.’
(22) Pola
Siti lo' mare sasssa'-an-na.
probably Siti not finish wash-NOM-DEF
‘Probably Siti didn’t finish the laundry.’
While these expressions cannot occur internal to the VP, they are marginally
acceptable in clause-final position, usually preceded by rising intonation and a
significant pause.
1.4. Manner adverbials
Manner adverbials are expressions that elaborate on the way that some action is
carried out, generally oriented toward an agent or cause (although this is by no
means a requirement). Manner expressions are generally adjectives and forms
derived from adjectives. These include: ceppet ‘fast’, duli/duliyan ‘hurriedly’,
laonan/on-laon ‘slowly’, santa' ‘fast’, te-ngate ‘carefully’, and others, as exemplified in (23) and (24).
(23) Hasan markir motor-ra neng ereng-nga roma-na te-ngate.
Hasan AV.park car-DEF at side-DEF house-DEF RED-careful
‘Hasan parked the car by the side of the house carefully.’
(24) Ali maso' ka kamar on-laon.
Ali enter to room RED-slow
‘Ali entered the room slowly.’Types of adverbial expressions 395The characteristic position for manner adverbs is the end of the VP, which is
generally clause-final position, as is true of te-ngate ‘carefully’ in (23) and onlaon ‘slowly’ in (24). However, manner adverbials can occur preverbally (25a)
and (26a) and clause-initially (25b) and (26b).
(25) a. Hasan te-ngate, markir motor-ra neng ereng-nga roma-na.
side-DEF house-DEF
Hasan RED-careful AV.park car-DEF at
‘Hasan carefully parked the car by the side of the house.’
b. Te-ngate, Hasan markir motor-ra neng ereng-nga roma-na.
RED-careful Hasan AV.park car-DEF at
side-DEF house-DEF
‘Carefully Hasan parked the car by the side of the house.’
(26) a. Ali on-laon maso' ka kamar.
Ali RED-slow enter to room
‘Ali entered the room slowly.’
b. On-laon Ali maso' ka kamar.
RED-slow Ali enter to room
‘Ali entered the room slowly.’
Additionally, manner adverbials can occur before PP dependents in the VP, (27)
and (28), although it is not a preferred position.
(27) Hasan markir motor-ra te-ngate,
neng ereng-nga roma-na.
side-DEF house-DEF
Hasan AV.park car-DEF RED-careful at
‘Hasan parked the car carefully by the side of the house.’
(28) Ali maso' on-laon ka kamar.
Ali enter RED-slow to room
‘Ali entered the room slowly.’
Manner of action can also be expressed in a PP headed by kalaban ‘with’,
as in (29) and (30).
(29) Rohina a-ra-kora
kalaban senneng.
happy
Rohina AV-RED-wash.dish with
‘Rohina washed the dishes happily.’
(30) Marlena noles
sorat dha' Solihin kalaban ceppet.
fast
Marlena AV.write letter to Solihin with
‘Marlena wrote a letter to Solihin quickly.’396 Chapter 12 Adverbs and adverbial clauses
Note that kalaban takes what appears to be an adjectival complement. In (29)
the complement of kalaban is senneng ‘happy’ and in (30) ceppet ‘fast’. This
parallels the construction in English that uses the nominalization of an adjective
as a complement of with (e.g. with happiness). If the madurese forms are zeroderived nominals, they are exceptional from the standpoint that most nominalizations of verbs minimally occur with the definite suffix -na. See Chapter 4
section 1.2.1 for discussion of this type of nomnialization. This is a very productive process.
Additionally, the intensive adjectival construction (Chapter 3 section
1.3.2 and Chapter 4 section 1.2.1) can serve the manner function, as in (31) and
(32).
(31) Rohina a-rakora
ce' senneng-nga.
Rohina AV-wash.dish very happy-DEF
‘Rohina washed the dishes very happily.’
(32) Marlena noles
sorat dha' Solihin ce' cepped-da.
Marlena AV.write letter to Solihin very fast-DEF
‘Marlena wrote a letter to Solihin very quickly.’
1.5. Degree modifiers
A number of degree words modify verbs, adjectives, and adverbial expressions,
including: banget ‘very’, ce' ‘very’, coma ‘only’ (and its alternate juma), gallu
‘too’, gi' ‘yet’, gun ‘only’, keng ‘only’, maggis ‘almost’, maha ‘highly (very)’,
neng ‘only’, para' ‘almost’, parana ‘very’. The use of ce' in the intensive construction has been well-documented (Chapter 3 and in (31) and (32) above),
thus others are illustrated here.
(33) Seddheng bi-abit para' e-kenneng-a e-buwang biggi'-na temon
RED-long almost OV-get-IRR OV-discard seed-DEF cucumber
when
bi' Temon Emmas.
by Temon Emmas
‘When she was almost caught, Temon Emmas threw the cucumber seeds.’
(34) Mon lamba' coma a-nyama Napo, sateya bagi dhuwa', Napo Daja,
Napo north
if
before only AV-name Napo now part two
Napo Lao'.
Napo south
‘In the past it only was named Napo, but now there are two parts, North
Napo and South Napo.’Derivation of adverbs 397In (33), para' ‘almost’ occurs right before the verb ekennenga ‘caught’, which it
modifies. In (34), coma ‘only’ occurs right before the verb anyama ‘have the
name’. Degree modifiers generally occur immediately before the element they
modify, as in the examples in (31-34). The lone exception to this is gallu ‘too’
(excessively), which follows the adjective it modifies, as described in Chapter 3
section 2.1 and exemplified in (35).
(35) Kopi reya manes gallu.
coffee this sweet too
‘This coffee is too sweet.’
2. Derivation of adverbs
As the data in section 1.1 amply illustrate, a number of regular processes are at
work in the derivation of adverbial expressions.
A great many temporal expressions are simply the nouns associated with
time. The nouns associated with time of day, time periods, names of days of the
week and months, and specific dates are all nominal expressions that assume an
adverbial function. Other temporal expressions are also nominal. The chief
means of derivation is the sa-...-na structure. As illustrated in section 1.1, a
verbal, adverbial or nominal root occurs in the structure sa-...-na to denote such
relative temporal relations as ‘before’ (sabellunna) and ‘after’ (samarena) and
‘when’ (sabaktona). With some expressions sa can be dropped, so marena and
baktona are commonly used as is the underived form bakto.
Many adjectival predicates can be used in root form, especially in the case
of manner adverbials and epistemic expressions. Thus, an adjective such as
ceppet ‘fast’ can be used both as a predicate (36) and as a manner adverbial
(37).
(36) Motor-ra Ina ceppet.
car-DEF Ina fast
‘Ina’s car is fast.’
(37) Ina nyetir motor-ra ceppet.
Ina AV.drive car-DEF fast
‘Ina drives her car fast.’
Adverbial expressions are also derived through reduplication and the suffix -an, which are used individually and in combination. Some of the frequency
expressions occur only as reduplicated roots, including dangkadang ‘sometimes’, poampo ‘sometimes’ and rangrang ‘seldom’. Manner adverbs such as398 Chapter 12 Adverbs and adverbial clauses
on-laon ‘slowly’ and te-ngate ‘carefully’ are also derived through reduplication.
Additionally, manner adverbs are derived through suffixation of -an to adjectival predicates, including laonan ‘slowly’, duliyan ‘in a hurry’, and ongguwan
‘really’. And at times, the two processes combine to derive adverbials, such as
on-laonan ‘slowly’, li-baliyan ‘several times’, gu-ongguwan ‘really’, and others. In the case of ‘slowly’, all of the following are possible.
(38) Ali maso' ka kamar on-laon/laon-an/on-laon-an.
Ali enter to room slowly
‘Ali entered the room slowly.’
3. Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clauses are introduced by subordinating conjunctions or subordinating expressions, which can be underived or morphologically complex, or by
parataxis (section 3.6). There are also complex conjunctions or correlative conjunctions. Adverbial clauses establish a relationship between the two states of
affairs described in the clauses, including purpose, reason (cause), condition,
concession, and time. In most instances, the adverbial clause can either precede
or follow the clause it modifies. There are some exceptions to this, as will be
noted below.
3.1. Purpose clauses
Adverbial clauses establish the purpose for which some action is undertaken.
Most commonly they are introduced by subordinators such as guna ‘in order
to’, kaangguy ‘for’, ma'le ‘in order to’ (and its alternative form malle), sopaja
‘so that’. As a purpose is established for undertaking the state of affairs described in the main clause, the predicate of the main clause in these cases tends
to be a verb that denotes an action, and not a state. Purpose adverbial clauses
usually follow the modified clause, as in (39-42).
(39) Satima ngomba sassa'-an-na tello kale ma'le
asel-la
berse.
Satima AV.rinse wash-NOM-DEF three time in.order.to success-DEF clean

Mataram
‘He sent his army to west Madura, to defeat the king of Arosbaya so that
he would pay tribute to Sultan Agung in Mataram.’
Purpose clauses can also precede the clause they modify, as in (43) and (44).
(43) Kaangguy nyare slamet, Pangeran Cakraningrat ka empa' pas buru.
AV.seek safe
Pangeran Cakraningrat ORD four then run

tengnga alas.
center forest
‘So that my father is not ashamed and so that my mother is not ashamed,
and I am not ashamed either, please abandon my baby deep in the forest.’
Some purpose clauses establish the main clause as a consequence of the
action of the adverbial clause.
(45) Dha'ramma mon pas laju kraton bisa sampe' e-pa-kala, bisa sampe'

1Some speakers reject the use of guna 'use' in (41), considering it to be Indonesian
rather than pure Madurese.","[407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416]"

The verbs and adjectives in (25) and (26) cannot be negated by banne, and negating the nominal predicates in (27) with ta' or lo' results in unacceptable sentences. Furthermore, it is instructive that nouns are not the only category negated with banne. Prepositional phrases take this constituent negator, as in (28)
and (29).
(28) Hadi melle permen kaangguy Sundari,banne kaangguy Sri.
Sundari not for

(29) Sengko' nyaba' hadiya banne neng meja tape neng erra'.
AV.put gift
not
at
table but at bookshelf
I
‘I put the gifts not on the table but on the bookshelf.’
Thus, negation with ta' or lo' is a characteristic distinct to verbs and adjectives.
The second property shared by verbal and adjectival roots that distinguishes them from nominal roots is their ability to be predicates in relative
clauses. This was illustrated in the sentences in (10-15), in which the headless
relative clause is the subject. Additional examples are:72 Chapter 3 Lexical categories
(30) Se tao jawab Ali.
REL know answer Ali
‘The one who knows the answer is Ali.’
(31) Se kowat Deni.
REL strong Deni
‘The one who is strong is Deni.’
(32) Se daddi hakim Ita.
REL become judge Ita
‘The one who is a judge is Ita.’
If the verb daddi ‘become’ were omitted from the relative clause in (32), the
sentence would no longer be acceptable.8
Additionally, there are morphological properties shared by verbs and
adjectives. One is the ability to combine with the suffix -e, which results in either a locative or causative meaning. The ‘locative’ meaning results when -e is
suffixed to a verb or adjective that takes a prepositional object and a causative
meaning with roots that do not.9 Thus in the set that follows, toles ‘write’, entar
‘go’, senneng ‘happy’, and pote ‘white’ combine grammatically with -e, but
bengko ‘house’ and kalambi ‘clothes’ do not. Second, verb and adjective roots
can take the instrumental prefix pang-, while noun roots cannot.10

8The verb daddi can be inserted in the relative clauses in (30) and (31). However, the
meaning changes accordingly as daddi is not being used in its placeholding sense. So,
Se daddi tao jawab Ali would mean ‘The one who will come to know the answer is Ali’
and Se daddi kowat Deni means ‘The one who will become strong is Deni’.

Finally, the form gella', which is an adverbial meaning ‘before’ or ‘recently’, can be used demonstratively in noun phrases, identifying a referent that
has been mentioned recently in the discourse. The sentence in (54) illustrates its
adverbial use.

‘The man went to Surabaya a while ago.’Possession 193In a noun phrase, gella' follows the head and indicates that the speaker is referring to an entity recently mentioned by speaker or addressee in the discourse.
This is illustrated in (55), which is minimally different from (54), but crucially
includes gella' as part of the NP and not as a clause-final verbal modifier.
(55) Reng lake' gella' entar ka Sorbaja.
person male before go to Surabaya
‘That man (we were talking about just now) went to Surabaya.’
The example in (56) shows the same usage, in this instances following a relative
clause modifier of the head of the NP.

‘Eventually the people of Ambunten and the surrounding area buried the
two bodies.’
5. Possession
As described in Chapter 3 section 2.4, except for first person singular, which
has a special pronominal form tang/sang, possession is typically indicated by
the affixation of the definite suffix -na followed by a nominal denoting the possessor, which may be overt or null (when the referent is recoverable from the
discourse context). The first person singular possessive pronoun is exemplified
in (57), and other instances of possession marked in the NP are in (58) - (59).2
(57) Tang bapa' entar ka Bandung.
my father go
to Bandung
‘My father went to Bandung.’
(58) Sengko' lo' maca buku-na ba'eng.
I
not AV.read book-DEF you
‘I haven’t read your book.’2Speakers sometimes regularize first person possession, using sengko' ‘I’ with the definite suffix, giving forms such as bapa'na senko' 'my father'.","[208, 209, 210]"
"186 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases
Pronominal possession is discussed in more detail in Chapter 3 section 2.4 and
in section 5.
Plural pronouns, which are not commonly used, are formed either by the
collocation of the singular pronoun with the quantifier kabbi ‘all’ or through
reduplication of aba' ‘body’. The latter can be used for all persons.
(21) sengko' kabbi
ba'na kabbi
aba'na kabbi
ba'-aba'‘we’
‘you’
‘they’
‘plural human’Examples of plural pronouns are given in (22-24)
(22) Engko' masala dungeng pole dha' ba'eng kabbi.
I

all
‘I have another story for you all.’
(23) Sengko' entar dha' tase' manceng ma'le kake kabbi tao rassa-na
I

juko' tase'.

‘I went to the sea to fish so that you all could experience the taste of fish
from the sea.’
(24) Ba'-aba' bisa a-tanya Tina minggu adha'.
RED-body can AV-ask Tina week
front
‘We can ask Tina next week.’
In (22), the form ba'eng kabbi ‘you (pl)’ is used by a narrator to refer to his
audience. In (23), the speaker uses the form kake kabbi ‘you (pl)’ to refer to his
addressees, in this instance his students. And in (24), there is an example of ba'aba' used to designate first person plural. Of course, first person plural can also
be expressed by conjunction of first and second person pronouns, as in (25).
(25) Sengko' bi' kake salamet.
I
with you safe
‘We are safe.’
Further, Pawitra (2009) cites engko' ban ba'na kabbi as a first person exclusive
form (equivalent to Indonesian kami) and engko' ban sakabbina bareng as an
inclusive form (equivalent to Indonesian kita).
As an alternative, it is possible to simply use the singular form of the pro-Pronouns 187noun to signify the plural. Pronouns are thus no different from regular noun
heads regarding inflecting for number. As shown in section 2.1, while common
nouns can be inflected for number through reduplication, this reduplication is
largely optional in actual usage. Whether a given NP is singular or plural is
sorted out through the discourse. The same is true of the pronouns in the following sentences, all of which clearly stand for plural entities given the context of
the narratives in which they were uttered.
(26) Jelling cara-na engko' a-laban satreya Majapahit reya!
AV-fight knight Majapahit this

‘Watch how we fight with these knights from Majapahit!’

(30) Mon se endha' kareb-a dibi' ajar-in.
if REL willing want-IRR self learn-LOC‘If they want it, teach them.’
In (26) and (27), the first person pronoun denotes plural entities–in (26) two
young men sent to conquer two Majapahit warriors who are terrorizing a town,
and in (27) two maidservants being sent on a mission. In (27), a higher (alos)
form dan kula is used for first person because the speaker is talking to a member of the royal family. In (28), the narrator addresses the audience of children
using the simple second person form ba'eng. In (29), aba'eng refers to the four
young daughters in the story Siti Lalumba, who had been awaiting the return of
their mother. Finally, in (30), there is an instance in which dibi' refers to a third188 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases
person plural, here, the people of Madura.
In (27), dan kula is used as the first person pronoun. This is one of many
first and second person pronominal forms that are used in the higher speech
levels. The complete set consists of:
(31) 1st person
bula
gula
kaula
kula
(ba)dan kaula
dalem
apdina
apdi dalem
bal-gebbal dalem2nd person
dika
diko
sampeyan
panjennengngan
padana
sampeyan dalem
ajunan dalem
ajunan sampeyan
ajunan panjennengnganThe following examples exemplify the use of some of these forms.
(32) Sapora-na ka'dhinto Pottre, ka'dhinto ampon parenta, dalem dhari
princess this
already command me

sorry-DEF this
rato kaangguy mate'-e ajunan, ajunan ampon e-anggep

‘Forgive me, princess, this is an order to me from the king for me to kill
you because the king thinks you are guilty.’
(33) Kaula mangken ampon ngarte

I

already understand this
‘lady’ princess COMP
panjennengngan ka'dhinto saestona lo' gadhuwan sala.
you
this
true
not have
wrong
‘I now understand this princess, that you are truly not guilty.’
Each of these examples is taken from a dialogue between a princess and the
minister instructed by her father to kill her. First person is expressed by both
dalem and kaula and second person by ajunan and panjennengngan. See Chapter 15 for discussion of the use of these pronouns and other aspects of the higher
speech levels.
Finally, proper names and titles can also be used pronominally. Thus,
under appropriate circumstances, the sentence in (34) can be uttered by Hanina
in reference to herself.","[202, 203, 204, 205]"
"Adverbial clauses 403There is no separate word equivalent to the English ‘unless’. Rather the
typical conditional clause is simply negated (61) and (62).
(61) Ja' endha' bukka' mon lo' sampe' dha' roma-na ya!
don’t want open if not until to house-DEF yes
‘Don’t open it unless you are home, ok?’
(62) Ba'eng ja' endha' mole
dha’ Madura ban Sumennep, mon gilo’
you don’t want go.home to Madura and Sumenep if not.yet
bisa ma-kala
rato Blambangan.
can AV.CS-defeat king Blambangan
‘You won’t be allowed to go home to Madura and Sumenep unless you
defeat the king of Blambangan.’
Used with a temporal expression–such as laggu ‘morning’, malem ‘night’,
lamba' ‘before’, sateya ‘now’, the names of specific days and months and so
on–the conditional structure indicates the time at which some state of affairs
usually obtains, as in (63) and (64).
(63) Biyasana mon gu-laggu
reng-oreng Balanda jiya late-yan
RED-morning RED-person Dutch this drill-NOM
usually if
rang-perrang-an neng lon-alon.
RED-war-NOM
at alun-alun
‘Usually every morning the Dutch soldiers did drills on the alun-alun.’
(64) Ban taon, apa pole mon Tellasan,bannya' oreng se nyalase dha'
every year what again if Idul Fitri many person REL AV.pray to
reng towa-na.
parent-DEF
‘Every year at Idul Fitri, many people pray for their parents.’
Conditionals can be used as a type of topicalization. In this structure mon
or kalamon occurs with a noun and a pronoun (generally null) occurs as the
subject or the possessor of the subject of the main clause. This is illustrated in
(65) and (66).
(65) Biyasana, mon pate
jiya, kodu seggut a-seba dha' rato.
usually if
minister this should often AV-face to king
‘Usually the chief minister should meet with the queen frequently.’404 Chapter 12 Adverbs and adverbial clauses
(66) Mon manossa, lo' bisa ng-okor
arapa me' pas tombu adha'
if
human not can AV-measure why EMPH then grow not.exist
bungkel-la.
root-DEF
‘Humans are unable to figure out why it grows without roots.’
In (65), mon pate ‘if a chief minister’ serves the function of a topic and the reference is picked up as the subject of the main clause. This is clear from the
comma intonation following jiya. Additionally, it is possible for an overt pronoun to occur in the matrix clause, as in (67) and (68).
(67) Biyasana, mon pate
jiya, aba'eng kodu seggut a-seba dha’ rato.
usually if
minister this he
should often AV-face to king
‘Usually the chief minister should meet with the queen frequently.’
(68) Mon manossa,aba'eng lo' bisa ng-okor
arapa me' pas tombu
if
human he
not can AV-measure why EMPH then grow
adha'
bungkel-la.
not.exist root-DEF
‘Humans are unable to figure out why it grows without roots.’
This structure can be viewed as an instance of a subordinate clause with a nominal predicate, i.e. ‘if someone is a chief minister’, but its function is to highlight a topic from a clause immediately or closely preceding it.
Finally, a mon phrase can act as a modifier of a noun, as mon mate ‘if
dead’ does in the NP kafan kaangguy mungkos oreng mon mate juwa ‘the
shroud for wrapping a person if he is dead’, (69).
(69) Kafan kaangguy mungkos oreng mon mate juwa, tao ba'eng, pote,
AV.wrap person if
dead that know you
white
shroud for
ta'iya?
TAG‘The shroud for wrapping a dead person, you know, is white, right?’
3.4. Concessive clauses
Concessive clause are introduced by the subordinators make, maske, maskeya,
najjan, sanajjan, sanare, and tekka'a, all of which can be translated as ‘though’,
‘although’, and ‘even though’. Concessive clauses may precede (70-72) or follow (73, 74) the clause they modify.","[419, 420, 421]"
