"9 Pragmatic and discourse characteristics
There are two morphological markers for focus and emphasis: ke 'FOCUS or
OBJECT MARKER'; and riki 'EMPHASIS'. Both are postposed to the head
word or phrase which they highlight. There is no restriction as to the category
with which riki can occur. The morpheme ke normally follows a noun or noun
phrase, including pronouns and demonstratives, but there are a few examples in
my data where it follows a verb that constitutes a nominalized clause
functioning as object (see, for example, 106a).
In transitive clauses where two nominals occur, one of them may be marked
with ke to indicate that the marked one is the object, that is the one to whom
the action is done. In many instances, the context or semantics may make it
clear as to who did what to whom. But there are occasions when it is not
clear and in such cases ke is used, functioning as an object marker:Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

INTNSFThe word tferehe consists of two morphemes: a*e '3' or 'that', which
usually has reference to the protasis, and rehe 'for, to', a postpositional
relator. In the protasis there are no restrictions as to the constituents that may
occur, so that the closure constituent may occur before a'erehe:

15SYNTAX OF PHRASE TYPES
Noun phrase structure15.1 Marking for case. The only element that might be considered a case
marker is the suffix ke, which marks the object in a transitive clause when two
nominals occur. See sects. 1.1 and 9 for a fuller description.

"15.2 Genitives.
There are two ways to express possession. One is by using
possessive pronouns, which also (except for the third person forms) can
function as the free form subject in a clause. The second way is by a nominal
phrase:

'deer's liver'In the x- class of nouns, x- changes to k- when possessed by a non-third
person or when not possessed at all. That is, words in this class beginning
with k- may or may not be possessed. Thus, the x- class of nouns is less rigid
than the A- or - classes in this respect. See the following examples, where the
non-possessed form kyha is used in (234a) and (234b) and the possessed form
xyha in (234c):

15.4 Nominalizations.
There are three basic forms of nominalizer: -ha,
-har, and me'e ke. The ke in me'e ke may be omitted, without any meaning
difference. The ke appears to be the same form as ke 'FOCUS', but in me'e
ke it does not function to mark focus or emphasis, at least in many cases.
Neither does it always have the object-marking function of ke.
The forms -ha and me'e ke nominalize verbs, while -har nominalizes adverbs
and postpositional phrases. There are two other variants of ha: -a occurs after
the consonant k, and -iha occurs after other consonants. Some speakers use
-iha, rather than -<j, following k.

18.4 Person and number.
Declarative clause verbs occur with the
following set of pronominal prefixes which agree in person and number with
the subject of the clause:
aereu-10-'ISC'
'2SG'
'3'jape-'1PL'
2PL'4The rules regarding third person forms are as follows. Verbs with
monosyllabic stems have the u- form, unless the stem has an o, in which case
the prefix is also o-. Polysyllabic stems have the zero variant. This latter group
includes all reflexive, reciprocal and causative verb forms. There are a few
irregular forms: i-xo (3-be) 'he is, he is moving'; o-u (3-be lying) 'he is in a
lying position'; we-rur (3-bring) 'he brings'; and i-hon (3-go) 'he went'. This
last form, hon 'go', only occurs with the third person subject (the form is ho
elsewhere). Some examples of each of the two classes of verb, based on the
form of the third person prefix, are:
Mzero
uhyk
uwyr
ukwa
usak'he arrives'
'he comes'
'he knows'
'he sees'matyr
me'e

jotok'he gathers'
'he gives'
'he pounds'
'he takes out'Examples of causative and reflexive forms are:
mowok 'he causes to split'
muhyk 'he causes to arrive'
jumu'e 'he learns'
Stative verbs have only third person singular prefix forms. Where a first or
second person subject is semantically possible, free pronouns are used (sect.
16, and cf. the noun possessor prefixes in sect. 15.2). The third person
prefixes follow the same forms and patterns as the third person possessor
prefixes in nouns, being the basis for setting up four sub-classes of stative verbBrought to you by | Cambridge University Library

Other'. In the h- class, the h changes to r for non-third person usage. Verbs
in the i- class occur only with third person subjects. Some examples of each
class are:
/-hheta 'they are many'
haku 'it is hot'
heö
'he is tired'

EMPH 3-soft

"Nouns belonging to the h- and i- classes, and some members of the x- class,
are obligatorily possessed.
15.3 Modifiers.
Modifiers of nouns fall into two groups: those that precede
the noun (numerals, quantifiers, and demonstratives); and those that follow the
noun (either postposed elements or stative verb roots, which combine with the
noun to form a compound noun). Compare the following forms: stative verb
(236a), compound noun (236b), and stative verb with a full nominal subject
(236c):
(236a)
(236b)
(236c)i-juk
3-rotten'It is rotten.'myra-juk
wood-rotten'rotten wood'myra i-juk
wood 3-rottenThe wood is rotten.'",[47]
"There are other nominalizers, but they occur infrequently. The form mi-/imi'thing', which is frequent in other Tupi-Guarani languages (e.g. Guajajara, per
Bendor-Samuel 1972:117), is found in only one Urubu word, possibly two:
(278)
(279)
(280)h-imi'u
3-NOMLZR-eat'his food'arar
mi'u
macaw NOMLZR-eat'macaw's food'h-imijar
3-NOMLZR-owner'his hunt'In (280), jar is not a transitive verb and this casts some doubt on whether
imi- here has the same nominalizing function as in (278) and (279). In other
Tupi-Guarani languages, mi- is prefixed to transitive verbs and the resulting
form belongs to the h- class of nouns (Bendor-Samuel 1972:117).
Another nominalizing form is -kwer, but this occurs very infrequently (it is
more productive in Guajajara, Bendor-Samuel 1972:122):
(281)janema'e
our thingke
FOCkatu-kwer
good-NOMLZRte
DMTNSFta
PUT'y

thus HSY 3PL
' ""Our things will really be good (things) now,"" thus they (said).'",[53]
"The form pokok seems to be derived from ipo 'his fist' and kok 'touch'. I
have not found kok used elsewhere in the language as spoken today, but it is
reported at an earlier historical stage (Boudin 1966:207).
There is one example of the compounding of a noun and a postpositional
relator: ha 'his hair' and ngi 'from' to form ham 'take off the hair' (there is
evidence in the language family for the morphophonemic change from ngi to
vw (cf. Bendor-Samuel 1972:140 and Boudin 1966:289):Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

stative verbs are incorporated into nouns as adjectives to form compound nouns

tree- foot- flat
'a flat tree trunk'(noun - noun - stative)(376b)itape- ra'yr
stone- flat- small
'a small flat stone'(noun - stative- stative)18.8 Auxiliary verb system.
The auxiliary verb follows the main verb
and, like the main verb, agrees in person and number with the subject of the
sentence. The forms which can be postposed to the verb (see sect. 18
introduction) occur following the main verb. Some of the more common
auxiliary verbs are:
rur'bring';jur'come';ho 'go';and raho'take'There is also the special sub-class of auxiliaries, the aspect auxiliary, which
is described in sect. 18.2.
Another type of auxiliary is the invariant form upa 'end, it is finished, that
is all'. In contrast with all other auxiliaries, upa always precedes the main
verb. In addition, it never occurs with first or second person pronouns or
prefixes (as it did in ancient Tupi-Guarani, cf. Anchieta 1876:55). It may be
separated from the main verb by other clause constituents:
(377)upa aman u-kyr
rahä jaho tipe
end rain 3-fall
when 1PL- go FRUST
'When it stopped raining, we went in vain.'",[70]
"19 Adjective phrase structure
Adjectives are stative verb roots and they occur in noun phrases as suffixes
attached to the head noun, thus forming a compound (see sect. 15.3).
20 Adverb phrase structure
Adverbiale may be either postpositional phrases (see sect. 17) or adverb
phrases. Adverb phrases consist of a head word, the adverb, with the
possibility of additional postposed elements.
The principal types of adverb are:
time, e.g. tararno 'today, recent time'; yman 'ages ago';
mukwehe 'sometime past'
space, e.g. ko 'here'; kotete 'nearby'
manner, e.g. pahar 'quickly'; wewe 'slowly'; täte 'almost'
Numerals could also be regarded as a type of adverb when they occur without
their noun head (see sect. 15.3).
The elements that can be postposed to adverbs in the adverb phrase include:
te 'DMTNSF', we 'short time', the postpositional relator rupi 'through', 'along'
(with space adverbs), jot 'right at that place'. Some examples, with and
without postposed elements, are:

alsoObject marking is not, however, the only function of ke. It can occur with
the subject nominal, of intransitive (137, 138) and transitive (139) clauses, and
it also occurs in postpositional phrases between the nominal and the
postpositional relator (140). As (139) shows, it may occur in a transitive clause
with both the subject and the object (cf. 13). I do not fully understand the
conditions under which ke is used to express these different functions, but
reactions of native speakers to its use with a single nominal in a transitive
clause consistently demonstrate that its function is then to distinguish the direct
object constituent. For the present, when it occurs with some other constituent,
I interpret its function as that of highlighting, and gloss it as 'FOCUS'.

21PARTICLESThere are two sub-classes of particles: medial and final. Medial particles

primary stress (sect. 22), and differ from postpositional relators (sect. 17) in
the functions they serve and the fact that they occur in any type of phrase:
noun, verb, adverb, or postpositional phrase. There are three medial particles:

eyewitness of the facts he narrates

that riki does not always occur with the first constituent of the clause (see

"Historically, there is, in Tupi-Guarani, another form of negative, expressed
by infixing a verb to nd-...-i (Rodrigues 1953:151). A similar construction
occurs in Guajajara, where a preverbal form na- 'NEG' occurs with the suffix
-z (Bendor-Samuel 1972:85,94-95). In Urubu-Kaapor, only one (uninflected)
form has remained of this construction: nixoi 'there is none' (derived from
-ixo- '3 be' and n-...-i 'NEG').
13AnaphoraTwo types of anaphora are dealt with in some detail in other parts of this
description: deleted elements (sect. 3), and pronominal forms (sects. 15.2; 16;
and 18.4). Here I will restrict my remarks to the special forms that occur as
sentence connectives.
There are four basic forms that occur as sentence connectives with anaphoric
reference: a'engi 'from there', arah 'at that time', ame'e 'that one', and aja
'thus, like that'. Other elements sometimes occur before these words, but as a
general rule they occur sentence-initial. (For another connective, a'erehe, which
links two clauses in a reason-result relationship, see sect. 14).
The connective a'engi 'from there' marks the continuation of a narrative with
a change of setting. It can be regarded as a paragraph boundary markerBrought to you by | Cambridge University Library

PUTIn ancient Tupi-Guarani (Anchieta 1876:12) and in Guajajara as it is spoken
today (Bendor-Samuel 1972:87,111), there are distinctive forms for inclusive
and exclusive first person pronouns. In Urubu-Kaapor the exclusive form and,
therefore, the distinction, have been lost, but there is a periphrastic way of
expressing the idea of exclusive first person (see sect. 15.3).
First and second person free forms occur as the head constituent in
postpositional phrases; for third person, the pronominal possessor prefix is
attached to the postposition:

suffixes we 'little' or te 'much', with or without katu 'good'. For example,

The antonyms of 'very good' are:

"SYNTAX OF THE SENTENCE OR CLAUSE
1 Word order
I shall refer to three clause types in Urubu-Kaapor, distinguished by the type
of predicate they contain: declarative, stative, and equational. There is a subset
of verbs I shall call statives, differing from declarative verbs in that they do
not take the first and second person pronominal prefixes or the imperative
prefix. A clause having a stative verb as its predicate is a stative clause. A
clause with any other verbal predicate is a declarative clause. A clause with a
nominal or adverbial predicate is an equational clause. Declarative clauses may
be transitive or intransitive, these differing only in the obligatory absence of an
object in the intransitive clause. Table 1 shows the differing features among
the clause types.",[1]

light nasalization. Light nasalization is conditioned by nasal environments and
it may be progressive or regressive.
Inherent nasalization refers to nasalized vowels which occur in oral
environments: ipö 'it is straight and narrow'; i'Vz 'his spirit'.
Progressive nasalization occurs when oral vowels are preceded by the nasals
m or n. These nasals cause progressive nasalization of the vowel immediately
following them: uruma [ufu'ma] 'duck'. It is possible to hear a phonetic
difference (accentuated by using a tape recorder in reverse) between inherent
and progressive nasalization when the two types occur syllable finally. When
prenasalized stops [mb] and [nd] occur, progressive nasalization is blocked:
mono [mö'nö] or [mo""ndo] 'he sends'. Progressive nasalization also does not
occur following ng and ngw, since their most frequently occurring variants are
[rjg] and [rjg""7] respectively.
Regressive nasalization occurs when a nasal (m, n, rj, or rjw), or an
inherently nasalized vowel, causes nasalization of the preceding vowel: aman
[ä""män] 'rain'. Regressive nasalization may extend further than a contiguous
syllable, but usage varies and I have not found it possible to arrive at any
definitive conclusions on how far it may extend or any conditioning factors.
(For a more complete description of this type of nasalization in Kaiwa, another
Tupi-Guarani language, see Harrison and Taylor 1971: 15).
Word stress is of two kinds, and where it is relevant to the discussion it is
written as: primary stress "" and secondary stress +. Another type of stress,
heavy emphatic stress, relates to a whole phonological clause.
Primary stress occurs on the final syllable of words: tata [ta'tta] 'fire'.
Secondary stress most commonly occurs on every second syllable counting
back from the primary stress: waruwa [+wafu*wa] 'glass, mirror'.
Some postposed elements perturb the stress pattern. (These postpositions
should perhaps be regarded as suffixes, but in this description have been
written as separate particle-type words, see sect. 18). The primary stress moves
from the last syllable of the head word to the postposed element and secondary
stress occurs where the primary stress would otherwise be: nupä [nu'ppä] 'he
hits'; nupä ta [nu+pa""tta] 'he will hit'; nupäy ta [nu+pät""tta] 'he will not hit'.
Example of noun and postposed element is: myra [mipfa] 'tree'; myra ke
[mt + fa""kke] ""tree FOCUS"". Modifiers of nouns also perturb the stress pattern
in a similar way (see sect. 15.3): myrara^yr [mi + fafa* ""tr] 'small tree'.

ke the one who was killed is very clear but without ke it is not. (The men
used the phrase ukwa ran 'he knows falsely' or One faintly understands').
This experiment seems to substantiate the results of the statistical study that
SOV is the basic word order.
The basic full order for a transitive clause is as follows:
Connective Adjunct Subject Object Verb Closure
Subject, object, and verb are considered nuclear constituents, while connective,
adjunct, and closure are peripheral constituents. It is only rarely that all these
constituents actually occur in a single clause, the usual number being four or
five.

main verb with a function similar to the verb 'to be'.
Final particles are so called because they normally occur in final position in
the clause or sentence, as the closure constituent. Only juxtaposed phrases may
follow them (see sect. 2). They also differ from medial particles in that they
are not postposed to any single clause constituent, but are related to the whole
clause. It is for this reason that I consider them a distinct clause constituent.
The functions of these final particles vary greatly: ky 'FUT.DEF .PURP'
indicates intention mood; ti 'again, also' relates the proposition in the clause to
some other proposition; and kwe 'time past' gives a distinctive temporal
perspective to the content of the clause. Not every sentence has a final
particle. The full set of final particles known to me is as follows:
rf
'still, yet'
ti
'again, also'
ky
'PUT. DEF. PURP' (sect. 18.3)
'y
'CMPL ACTION, now' (sect. 18.2)
ky
'finally, now'
kwe
'time past'
mä
'EXCLM, SURPRISE'
my, nahä, mamy, naha my 'UNCERT, perhaps' (sect. 18.3)
Certain of these final particles may cooccur: |y may follow ky, ky and mä; ti
may follow ky and mä. Some examples of final particles in sentences are:(390)pay je'e
ym
we
Pay
3+speak NEG little
'Pay hadn't spoken yet.'","[72, 73]"
"Closely related to pe is pe riki 'then, and so, and it was that, but'. This
occurs less frequently than pe, but it also marks a sequence of events, being a
combination of the forms pe 'and' and riki 'EMPH'. It has slightly stronger
cause-result overtones than pe. For example, note the following consecutive
sentences:
(119a)tapi'iruhu juka
cow
3 +kill
'He killed a cow.'(119b)pe
riki
pupur
and then 3 -l-boil
'And then he cooked (some).'",[23]

There are no passive constructions. The valence changing
prefixes ju- 'REFLX' and mu- 'CAUS' are described in sect. 4 and sect. 6
respectively. There is one other valence changing prefix: ru- 'COMFT'. It
occurs with an intransitive verb root to form a transitive verb:
ru- 'COMFT' plus ho 'go' results in mho 'take away, carry':

"URUBU-KAAPOR
James Kakumasu
INTRODUCTION
Urubu-Kaapor belongs to the Tupi-Guarani language family and is spoken by
approximately 500 Indians in the northeast corner of Brazil. They live on the
tributaries of streams that flow into the rivers Gurupi, Maracac.ume, Paraua and
Turiacu in the state of Maranhäo. There are approximately ten villages
scattered from the river Gurupi to the river Turiac.u, an area covering some
2800 square miles.
Urubu is the name by which the tribe is known to Brazilians. It is the
Portuguese word meaning 'buzzard'. In anthropological journals, the tribe is
often referred to as Urubu-Kaapor. The Indians refer to themselves as Aa'apor,
which means 'forest-dwellers'. In this paper they will be called Urubu-Kaapor.
Until the early 1970's, the Urubu-Kaapor Indians were isolated from the
outside world. But in the early seventies, a highway was completed from
Belem to Säo Luis which passed close to villages near the Paraua river.
Because of the highway, the whole tribe has more contact than ever before
with the outside world and, as a result, bilingualism is increasing, especially
among the younger men. Before the highway, less than five per cent of the
people were bilingual.",[1]
