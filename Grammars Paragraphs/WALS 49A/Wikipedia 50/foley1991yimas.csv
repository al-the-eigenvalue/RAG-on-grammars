-The Yimas Language
of New Guinea1The Language and Its Speakers1 . 1 Linguistic Type
Yimas belongs to the grouping of languages spoken in the Pacific known
as Papuan languages .. Languages of the New Guinea area are generally
divided into two large groupings: Austronesian languages and Papuan
languages. The Austronesian languages all belong to the far-flung Aus­
tronesian language family, stretching east to west from Southeast Asia
to Hawaii, and north to south from Formosa to New Zealand. Most of
the roughly 250 Austronesian languages of the New Guinea area (and
all of those in Papua New Guinea) belong to a single subgroup of the
family known as the Oceanic subgroup.
Papuan languages are quite different in this respect. The 750 or so
Papuan languages do not constitute a single, genetically unified language
family, but rather are organized into about sixty different language fam­
ilies averaging ten member languages each. With much more careful and
detailed comparative work, some of these language families will undoubt­
edly be combined into larger genetic groupings, as the Celtic, Germanic,
and Slavic language families among others have been combined to form
the Indo-European language family. Wurm (1982) presents some hy­
potheses in this direction, but at this point nearly all of these need to
be verified by careful comparative work.
With so many Papuan language families composed of so many dis­
tinct languages, it is very difficult to describe what a 'typical' Papuan
language is, as all generalizations will be contradicted by one language
or indeed one language family. Nonetheless, I attempted just this in
Foley 1986, and I will summarize here how Yimas fits with the charac­
terizations of Papuan languages proposed in that work. Yimas is one
of six member languages of the Lower Sepik family (see Section 1 .4 for
more discussion of the family, as well as Foley 1986, 214-29). As with
12THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSthe other languages of the family, it is morphologically agglutinative,
employing both prefixes and suffixes. Word order is highly variable and
quite free, although some other languages in the family have a weak
preference for Subject/ Object/Verb.
The phonological inventory of Yimas is small, even by the stan­
dards of Papuan languages, having only 12 consonants and 4 vowels.
The phonology exhibits many features typical of Sepik area languages.
There are no fricative phonemes; [s] is just an allophonic realization of
the voiceless palatal stop / c /. The language distinguishes four places of
articulation: bilabial, dental, palatal, and velar, with a corresponding
voiceless stop and nasal in each position. There is no voiced/voiceless
distinction for stops, the voiced stops being allophonic realizations of the
voiceless stops in certain positions, such as following nasals. Unusually
for a Papuan language, Yimas has an r/l distinction, but the /1/ is always
palatal(ized) , i.e., [lY] or [.A] , and the /r/ is always dental-alveolar, to a
large extent varying freely between [l] and [r] as phonetic realizations.
The vocalic system is typically-one might say prototypically-Sepik.
There is a dearth of vowel phonemes, both abstractly and as the seg­
mental phonemes of particular words. Many words lack underlying vowel
phonemes altogether, and the string of underlying consonants is broken
up in phonetic realization by epenthetic vowels inserted by a phonolog­
ical rule. The only clear unambiguous underlying vowel in the language
is the low central vowel fa/. The three high vowels /i, i, uj are often the
result of vowel epenthesis, the /i/ almost invariably so. The semivowels
jyj and jwj, especially the latter, interact closely with the phonological
rules involving vowels, such that their phonetic realization is often the
result of these rules. Stress is predictable and generally occurs initially.
Yimas has two major word classes, noun and verb. In addition to
these, there are eight minor categories: adjective, quantifier, locational,
temporal, pronoun, deictic, conjunction, and interjection. There are
only three true adjectives in Yimas; other roots corresponding to adjec­
tives in English belong to the major classes of verb and noun. Quantifiers
must be treated as a separate word class from adjectives in Yimas due to
their highly divergent morphology. Locationals and temporals are two
adverb-like parts of speech, expressing the spatial and temporal orien­
tations of events. They both share some of the features of nouns, such
as the occasional ability to pluralize. The number distinctions of Yimas
pronouns are much richer than in most other Papuan languages. In ad­
dition to the usual three persons, Yimas pronouns distinguish four num­
bers: singular, dual, paucal (a few), and plural (more than a few). De­
ictics exhibit a three-way distinction: place near the speaker, place near
the addressee, and place near neither of these. There are over sixty ofLINGUISTIC TYPE3these deictic forms; besides deictic distance, they distinguish noun class
and number of the nominal designating the object whose position they
describe. Like most Papuan languages, Yimas has a very restricted set
of conjunctions (some languages in the central highlands of Papua New
Guinea lack them entirely). There are no subordinating conjunctions
and only two coordinating conjunctions, equivalent to 'and' and 'but'.
Nouns in Yimas are characterized by being divided into ten major
classes, plus a few idiosyncratic classes. The criteria for assignment to
noun class are both semantic and phonological. Nouns are obligato­
rily inflected for three numbers (singular, dual, and plural) , with the
morphemes indicating number highly variable according to noun class.
Suppletion of the noun stem in the plural form is common. The only
other inflection available to nouns is case, and for this there is only a
single oblique case inflection, which marks nouns functioning in an in­
strumental or locative role. Possession is marked by a particle postposed
to the possessor.
Verbs are the most morphologically complex word class in Yimas,
and they are highly so; about half of this grammar is devoted to verb
morphology. Because of this complexity, Yimas can properly be char­
acterized as an agglutinative polysynthetic language, equal in most re­
spects to the much discussed polysynthetic languages of the Americas.
The verb can occur with many prefixes and suffixes, with the former pre­
dominating. The suffixes largely express notions of tense, aspect, and
mood. The language is very rich in this area, marking, for example, eight
distinct tenses. There are five potentially filled suffixal slots to the verb.
The prefixes are more numerous, with eight potentially filled positions.
The prefixes express notions like modality; agreement for noun class, per­
son and number of core nominals like subject, direct object, and indirect
object (this information can also be expressed by suffixes in some envi­
ronments) ; adverbial notions like place, direction, duration and manner;
and finally, valence alternations to the verb like reciprocal formation,
causativization and applicative verb formation (see Comrie 1985). An­
other common feature of verbs is verb compounding, or serialization.
This is done at the word level, as shown by the fact that the whole set
of verbal prefixes and suffixes flank these compounded verbal forms.
Pronouns in Yimas are not inflected. True pronouns only exist for
first- and second-persons; the so-called third-person independent pro­
nouns are actually deictics, and distinguish noun class and number.
Pronouns are actually rather infrequently used in Yimas, for the simple
reason that the verb has pronominal affixes for the subject, direct object,
and indirect object of the clauses. These affixes exhibit a very complex
1wrson-bascd split for their case-marking schema. First- and second-4THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSperson forms follow an underlying nominative/accusative pattern, and
third-person forms, something like an ergative/absolutive one.
Word order in Yimas is remarkably free, even in comparison to
the relative freedom exhibited by other Papuan languages. Within the
clause, there is no set word order pattern at all (in fact, the majority
of clauses consist of just a verb, so word order is not much of a ques­
tion in these cases anyway) . The verb has a slight tendency to occur
last in a pragmatically unmarked context, with the preceding nominals
in any order, but it is common for a nominal to occur after the verb
with a slightly marked pragmatic force. Word order in Yimas is so free
that noun phrases need not even form a constituent. Yimas exhibits
the 'scrambled' pattern of noun phrases, well known from Australian
languages, in which a noun and its modifiers can be separated from one
another within the clause. In these cases, the modifiers obligatorily take
concord affixes for the noun class and number of the noun they modify.
Yimas contrasts with many other Papuan languages in making less
extensive use of clause chaining (Foley 1986). Yimas completely lacks a
productive morphological system of switch reference: the same form of a
medial dependent verb form can be used before another verb regardless
of whether they share the same subject or not. The most common type
of clause linkage in Yimas involves nominalization, both finite and non­
finite. Finite nominalizations in Yimas correspond to relative and ad­
verbial subordinate clauses in more familiar languages, while non-finite
nominalizations are like infinitive complements and gerunds. Yimas can
also link clauses through coordination, by simple juxtaposition, or by
using one of its two conjunctions.
Yimas discourse strikes an English speaker as very dense. Because
of the pronominal agreement affixes, overt nominals are rare and carry
strong contrastive emphasis. This results in the text often consisting
of little more than verbs over long stretches. The highly incorporating,
agglutinative morphology of the verb further contributes to this impres­
sion of density: much information is carried by the bound affixes of the
verb, in contrast to the independent words of a language like English.
This can put heavy processing loads on the hearer in trying to decipher
a verb consisting of ten morphemes.
Yimas is spoken in two villages, totaling about 250 people. One vil­
lage is the original village site, and the other has only recently hived
off from that village, since 1970 or so. There is constant traveling back
and forth between the two villages, most people spending some time
each year in both. Only a small minority live exclusively in one or the
other village, but even these make day trips between the two, which are
separated by about 15 km. Because of this situation, there is no geo-LINGUISTIC TYPE5graphically based dialect differentiation in the Yimas language. There is,
however, significant socially based differentiation according to age. All
speakers under 40 have grown up bilingual in Tok Pisin, and this has
influenced their Yimas to a greater or lesser extent. Even older male
speakers who grew up monolingually in Yimas and learned Tok Pisin
while serving stints as recruited plantation labor show this influence to
some extent. Older women speak the least affected Yimas and show the
lowest degree of fluency in Tok Pisin.
Tok Pisin is the prestige language and its influence on Yimas has two
effects. First, Tok Pisin words are borrowed into Yimas. This borrowing
may be so heavy that the speaker's talk may resemble a code switching­
like discourse, containing snatches of Yimas followed by Tok Pisin. In
other cases, Tok Pisin forms are borrowed into what is otherwise pure
Yimas. These may be nativized to such an extent that speakers are
unaware of the words' ancestry. Second, the very complex morphology
of Yimas is subject to simplification. Verbs have fewer morpheme slots
filled, and irregular and suppletive forms are regularized. In some cases
these irregular forms may be lost altogether. For example, almost no
speakers under 40 can completely control the highly complex and irreg­
ular numeral system. In daily use these are replaced by the Tok Pisin
numbers. The whole impression of the Yimas of younger speakers is its
simplicity and regularity relative to the highly complex and irregular
language of older (especially female) speakers. The language described
principally in this grammar is of men now in their late thirties, who
grew up in an almost purely monolingual Yimas environment, and who
speak a relatively rich and elaborate version of the language. Regular­
izations and changes in the speech of younger speakers will be noted
when relevant.
The influence of Tok Pisin on Yimas is now reaching its logical out­
come among the very young. Many young children in the Yimas commu­
nities, especially those under seven years of age, are not learning Yimas
at all and are certainly growing up with Tok Pisin as their first language.
Whether they will learn Yimas as a second language around ten years
of age or slightly older is not clear at the moment, but this seems un­
likely, given the status attached to Tok Pisin (Foley 1986, 27-8) and the
great morphological complexity of Yimas, which puts a great burden on
simple memory in language acquisition. In traditional times, the single
greatest intellectual task facing a Yimas child was probably learning his
language. But now with schooling and other Western accoutrements,
there are other claims on his time. It is perhaps too early to say that
the Yimas language is dying, but it must be admitted that the prognosis
is not good.","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"I : I I I :jk � k P,'
.
R
""R' F
/nawkan/
/kakawpi/
'chicken'
'lies'
will be written as nawkwan and kawkawpwi, respectively. This seems
necessary because R spreading in these cases produces a segment w
rather than just rounding the vowel. Finally, initial w as a result of
initial semivowel formation (2-10) will also be orthographically repre­
sented; thus jut/ 'night' becomes orthographic wut. This will not be
done with initial y resulting from the same rule. This difference in or­
thographic convention reflects the more common pronunciation.
Consonants contrast with vowels in the orthography in that their
writing conventions approach their surface phonetic realizations more
closely. This was already mentioned with the case of final stops following
nasals. Any underlying consonant which undergoes a phonological rule
of Section 2.3, such as palatalization (2-3) or liquid strengthening (2-4, 25), will be written as the derived segment, not the underlying one. Thus
jtaJ]kway + takal + k/ 'look after' will be written as tal]kwaycakalk
(palatalization) , fapur/ 'green skink' as aput (final liquid strengthen­
ing) , and /tal + na + k/ 'hold it' as tatJlak (palatalization plus prenasal
liquid strengthening).
�---3Word C lassesYimas has only two major, open classes of words, nouns and verbs; all
other classes are small and closed. The inventory of the closed classes is
the following:
pronouns
deictics
conjunctions
interjectionsadjectives
quantifiers
locationals
temporalsWe can distinguish these word classes by a variety of criteria; both se­
mantic and formal. Often the semantic content of a word class will
determine its range of morphological possibilities. For example, nouns
commonly denote objects. Hence number, the morphological category
for the expression of multiple tokens of an object, and case, the category
which indicates the role an object plays in a given event, are general
inflectional possibilities for nouns. Verbs, on the other hand, denote
states or events. A common morphological category for them is tense,
which expresses the time at which the event occurs. But not all inflec­
tional categories can be explained so straightforwardly: Yimas verbs are
assigned to just one word class, but the language has a rich system of
derivational morphology by which verbs are derived into nouns and ad­
jectives. Adjectives in turn may be derived into adverbs and verbs. No
other parts of speech are derivable. Some choices are just an arbitrary
feature of a particular language. For example, in Yimas number is an in­
flectional category of verbs as well as nouns. Consequently, word classes
cannot be defined in terms of semantic content alone, but we must use
in their definitions a combination of semantic content, morphological
possibilities, and syntactic behavior. This is the procedure that I will
follow in defining each of the Yimas word classes in the sections that
follow.
8!190WORD CLASSES3.1 Nouns
Nouns are the word class which provides an inventory of the objects
of interest in the world (or imagination) of the speakers of a language.
Nouns are employed in discourse to introduce props, entities, and partic­
ipants relevant to the progression of the discourse. They accomplish this
because by the conventions of the language they are symbols associated
with their referents, the real world or imaginary objects which are called
into mind when the noun is uttered in discourse.
The natural world, as well as the human creations of the social and
cultural worlds, presents a vast array of entities which may be con­
ventionally expressed by nouns. Each language group, according to its
interests, its ecological niche, its social and cultural forms, selects from
this range and codes a subset of it in its system of nouns. However, the
system of nouns is still always large and is invariably the largest word
class in a language. This is undoubtedly true of Yimas, in which the set
of nouns is much larger than the next largest word class, verbs.
Because nouns are typically employed in discourse to introduce or
mention props or participants, they are associated with syntactic func­
tions which describe these participants or express their roles. Nouns fill
the functions of grammatical relations such as subject and object and are
associated with the category of case, which expresses the syntactic roles
of participants. For example, Yimas has a single case marker, an oblique
case suffix - n ""' - nan, which indicates locations, times or instruments
(see Section 4.2). This is a common inflection for noun stems:
(3-1) nam-n
tmat-jlan
wanwa-n
rna
house-OBL
other sun-OBL
knife-OBL
'with a knife'
'on another day'
'in the house'
Nouns also function as the subject and object of a verb. Nouns in
these functions are not inflected for case, but do agree in person and
number with the verb. Their agreement is indicated by a set of verb
prefixes (0 indicates the object of a transitive verb and A, its subject;
see Section 5.1.1).
(3-2) a. narmau namat pu-n-tu-t
woman men
3PL 0-3SG A-kill-PERF
'The woman killed the men.'
b. narmau namat na-mpu-tu-t
woman men
3SG 0-3PL A-kill-PERF
'The men killed the woman.'
The word order of the nouns in Yimas is free, so order does not sig­
nal their syntactic functions as it does in English (compare the English
translations of the above examples). Rather this is indicated by the pre-91NOUNSfixes t o the verb. The sequence o f prefixes in (3-2a) pu-n- indicates a
singular subject and a plural object, so the plural noun in the sentence
namat 'men' is the subject, and the singular noun narmav 'woman' is
the object. The opposite situation obtains in (3-2b) where the prefix
sequence na-mpu- indicates a singular object and a plural subject.
The morphology of nouns will be treated in greater detail in Chapter
4, so I will only mention here some basic morphological defining char­
acteristics. All nouns except for proper names are inflected for three
numbers-singular, dual and plural-and are assigned to a single noun
class. It is this last feature which distinguishes nouns from adjectives
or deictics. Adjectives and deictics vary over the whole range of noun
classes, co-occurring with all possible number/class suffixes. Nouns dif­
fer in being uniquely assigned to a class and taking the number/ class
suffixes specific to that class. Contrast the adjective ma 'other', occur­
ring with a number of different number/class suffixes, with the class VI
noun kav 'shell':

many common nouns have suppletive forms to mark number, i.e., the
singular and plural forms have different stems (in all these cases the dual
form is derived regularly from the singular stem) . This generally applies
to nouns referring to human beings, some animals and other important
objects. Consider the following small sample:

two possible inflections, the number/class markers and the oblique case
suffix -n ,...., - nan . The morphology of nouns is exclusively suffixal, while
that of verbs is both prefixal and suffixal. Nouns are inherently assigned
to a given class and are marked for number by a set of number suffixes
which vary for class.

yakiaura-3.2 Verbs
Verbs contrast with nouns in that they are the word class which denote
events or states. While objects, especially those in the natural world,
exist in their own right, this is not true of events or states. These only
manifest themselves by virtue of some object or objects undergoing or
performing them. The set of verbs in a language may be viewed as a
script outlining the various modes in which objects denoted by the set
of nouns may interact.
Because verbs function as the script of a language, it is they which
lay out the basic plot of a discourse. Verbs prototypically fill the syntac­
tic/semantic function of the predicate of the clause, which denotes theADJECTIVES93nature of the state or event participated in by a set of objects referred
to by the nouns in the clause. Thus, the verb hit functioning in John hit
Peter tells us the manner in which John and Peter interacted. Verbs like
hit indicating a transaction between two or more objects are transitive.
Other verbs function as predicates denoting an event or state performed
or undergone by some object; these are intransitive verbs, and exam­
ples are run as in John ran in the race, or sleep as in John slept in the
barn.
The morphology of verbs will be treated in detail in Chapters 5 and
6, so I will only discuss some basic defining features here. The morpho­
logical feature most characteristic of verbs, and the only obligatory one,
is tense. All finite verbs must be inflected for tense, and non-finite verbs
must have a suffix -ru in the normal inflectional position for tense. No
other part of speech is ever inflected for tense, so it can be regarded as
a necessary and sufficient condition on the word class verb.
A second defining characteristic of verbs is that only they can occur
with the modal prefixes, such as ta- NEG, ant- POT and ka- LIKELY.
These are not necessary inflections on a verb, as most verbs are un­
marked for modality. But the potential occurrence of one of these pre­
fixes on a word always identifies it as a verb, for no other word class is
inflectable for modality.
A third morphological characteristic of verbs is the presence of pre­
fixes to indicate the person, number, and noun class of core nominal ar­
guments, i.e., subject, object, and indirect object. I have already pointed
out how nouns are uniquely assigned to noun classes and inflected for
number by suffixes, varying allomorphically according to noun class.
Verbs parallel this variation for noun class and number by indicating
these features for the nouns functioning as their core arguments, but do
so by means of prefixes. Examples of such verbal prefixes corresponding
to the noun suffixes were presented at the end of Section 3.2.
3.3 Adjectives
Adjectives are the word class that expresses a state, quality, or defining
characteristic of some object. As such, they most commonly function
syntactically as the modifier of some noun in a noun phrase. Some
languages seem to have no word class of adjectives at a.ll, assigning all
words denoting states or qualities of objects to the word classes verb or
noun (Dixon 1977). Other languages have a very small and restricted
class of adjectives. Yimas is one of these. There are only three true
unambiguous examples of adjectives in the language. They are kpa 'big',
yua 'good', and ma 'other'. These are distinguished from other Yimas
words denoting qualities of objects in that they are uninflected for the94WORO CLASSESverbal category tense and may occur with a following noun in a tightly
knit noun phrase (see Section 4.6).
(3-3) a. kpa nam
b. * nam kpa
house big
big house
'a big house'
No other word can occur between the adjective and the head noun. If this
should occur, the adjective must then be suffixed with a number class
suffix agreeing in these features with the modified noun. Its position is
now free and can occur on either side of the noun.
(3-4) a. kpa-nm
nam
big-house SG house
'a big house'
b. nam kpa-nm
house big-house SG
'a big house'
In fact, the inflected adjective need not even adjoin the noun, but may
occur anywhere in the clause.
(3-5) ama-na
nam
lSG-POSS house SG
ant-ka-na-war-kiant-nm
kpa-nm
POT-lSG A-DEF-build-NR FUT-house SG big-house SG
'Tomorrow I will be able to build my big house.'
Other words denoting qualities are morphologically verbs. These
occur with the suffix -k, the tense suffix for irrealis (IRR) . This suffix
is normally used to remove the action denoted by the verb from the
continuum in real time and thus mark it as timeless. It is therefore
used for events in the legendary past, unrealized events in the future
whose time of occurrence cannot be fixed, and states whose duration
cannot be bound (see Section 5.2. 1 . 1 ) . It is this last meaning which
accounts for its use with words denoting qualities. These adjectival-like
verbs suffixed with - k also require a number/class suffix, agreeing in
these features with a modified noun. As such they may occur on either
side of the noun, or may not even adjoin it. These tensed adjectival
verbs never occur in the construction characteristic of true adjectives,
i.e., immediately preceding the head noun in a close-knit noun phrase
without the number/ class suffixes. Examples of these adjectival verbs
follow:
(3-6) a. apak tukut-k-nmau
sister heavy-IRR-11 SG
'a fat sister'ADJECTIVES95b. urkpwica-k-n
numpran
black-IRR-III SG pig III SG
'a black pig'
*
c. urkpwica numpran
black
pig III SG
The adjectival verbs comprise the largest class of words denoting qual­
ities in Yimas. Besides the first stems already illustrated, we have the
following non-exhaustive list:
'white'
'long'
'short'
'hard/strong'
'light'
'new'
'straight'yarackaw!Jkraparmpakalcwal]lakantmakrat!Jk-'sharp'
'whole'
'hollow'
'stubborn'
'empty, clear'
'dry'wapimuntaurmpwi­
ara!Jalca­
kamtakacJlaA further indication that these so-called adjectival verbs are really
verbs shows up in the formation of inchoatives, expressing changes of
state. The adjectival verbs can do this directly, by changing the tense
inflection to one within the real temporal continuum, and changing the
number/ class suffixes to the more typically verbal number/class prefixes
(S indicates the subject of an intransitive verb).
(3-7) a. na-t!Jknt-t
II SG S-become heavy-PERF
'She got fat.'
p-urkpwica-t
b. narm
skin VII SG VII SG S-blacken-PERF
' (My) skin darkened.'
The examples in (3-7) clearly indicate that these stems in their basic
meaning are process verbs; they only assume the stative meaning by
virtue by the IRR suffix -k, which stipulates that the event is unbounded
in time.
The true adjectives may not form inchoatives in this fashion. Rather
they must occur with the verb ti- 'do, become, feel', which carries the
tense suffix. The adjective may occur as a separate word or may be
incorporated into the verb, but in both cases it must co-occur with the
proper number/class suffix for the subject of the verb.

"Evidence that the non-singular second person A's in (5-29c, d) are bound
to the verbs, but that these first person A's are not is presented in
the discussion of negation (see Section 5.2.2.1). As (5-29a) shows, a
first singular A is assumed in the absence of an overt pronoun. These
examples indicate that in the conflict between principles one and two for
the ordering of the first and second person A and 0 prefixes, the second
is the more important, for it is the 0 which is realized as the verbal
prefix, as principle two would require, in spite of the fact that it is the
lower ranking participant by principle one.
5.1.3 Ditransitive Verbs and the Expression of the Dative
So far I have been using the notions of transitive and intransitive in a
descriptive and rather pre-theoretical manner. As we shall see in Section
5.1.6, these notions are not without their problems when applied to Yi­
mas, but for the time being I will continue to use them as I have defined
above. In addition to the many intransitive and transitive verbs, Yimas
has four inherently ditransitive verbs, although many basic transitive
verbs can be made ditransitive through the valence increasing prefixes
(see Section 6.2.3). These four basic ditransitive verbs are va- 'give', i­
'tell someone', tkam- 'show', and pul- 'rub on'. Ditransitive verbs are
distinctive in Yimas by allowing three pronominal affixes, the third one
being used to express what is called in traditional grammar the indirect
object or dative case, as boy in the girl gave the snake to the boy. The
range of this third affix in Yimas is much wider than simply the indirect
object in English and corresponds to many uses of the dative case in
classical languages like Latin, so I will refer to these affixes as the dative
affixes (abbreviation: D). For first and second person, these dative af­
fixes are, in fact, homophonous with the 0 prefixes, but for third person
there is a distinct set of dative suffixes.
(5-30) a. ura!J
k-mpu-va-tkam-t
coconut VI SG VI SG 0-3PL A-lSG D-show-PERF
'They showed me the coconut.'
b. ura!J
k-mpu-tkam-r-mpn
coconut VI SG VI SG 0-3PL A-show-PERF-3DL D
'They showed them two the coconut. '
Note that the dative affixes are the same as the 0 forms only in the
first and second persons, the persons that align participant roles ac­
cording to a nominative-accusative schema. In the third person forms,THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS209which follow an ergative-absolutive alignment, the dative suffixes are
distinct from both the A and 0 prefix forms. This suggests that the
first and second persons follow not so much a nominative-accusative
schema, as a nominative-dative one, in accord with Silverstein's (1976,
1980) claim of the underlying salience of the nominative-dative case op­
position. Although the 0 and D prefixes for first and second person
are homophonous, they must be regarded as distinct because of their
different substitution possibilities: 0 prefixes by third person absolutive
prefixes and D prefixes by third person dative suffixes. This claim is
further buttressed by their behavior in relativization (see Section 7.2.1).
The data on the verbal pronominal suffixes presented so far demon­
strates a fundamental split between the first and second persons on the
one hand and third person on the other. First and second person have
a three way split between S, A, and 0, with D equivalent formally to
0. This is of course, underlaid by a nominative-accusative system (or
nominative-dative) with S = A and opposed to 0 /D. Third person forms
exhibit an ergative-absolutive system with S = 0 opposed to A and with
a distinct D series. The differences between the persons can be summa­
rized as follows:
D
S
A
0
IJa1/2 kaama-mpn
impa3 mpiIn the accusatively marking persons 0 collapses with D, but in the erga­
tively marking person, it collapses with S. Is there a unified notion of 0
that lies behind these different encodings? This question parallels the
earlier one whether there is a unified notion of subject underneath the
nominative-accusative/ergative-absolutive split based on person. Both
questions are far too complex to answer completely here, and data bear­
i ng on them will be continually presented when I treat the syntax of
clauses and complex sentences in Chapters 6 and 7. The vast major­
ity of syntactic processes in Yimas are realized through morphological
devices, and the grammatical relations involved in these processes are
those reflected in the morphology. Hence when the morphology reflects
this person-based split, there is scant evidence to support the claim of
a unity underlying that split. There are, however, a few syntactic con­
Htructions which do provide evidence for unified notions of subject and
object, and this will be noted when they are discussed. But at this point
I will stick closely to the various categories that the morphology justifies.
Now let me return to the examples in (5-30). Even though I have
n�jected the idea of a morphologically coherent notion of 0 for ditran­
H it.ive verbs, equivalent to the 0 of transitive verbs, I can still proposeBASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY210rather straightforward analyses. In (5-30a), the verb tkam 'show' is as­
sociated with three core arguments. The initiating participant, the A,
is third person plural and is realized by the proper prefix mpu- 3PL A.
The next participant is the dative nominal, the participant to whom
the coconut is shown. Because the dative participant is first singular, a
person-number combination whose marking of participant relations fol­
lows a nominative-dative schema, it will be realized by the prefix va-,
the 0 form, or perhaps more precisely, the non-nominative form. Be­
cause the first person participant outranks the third person participant
by the first hierarchical principle, its prefix will occupy the ranking po­
sition closer to the verb stem. Finally, the remaining core participant,
urav 'coconut', a class VI singular noun, is realized on the verb by the
corresponding prefix of that class and number, k-. Because it is the low­
est ranking prefixed participant, its prefix will occur first. Now consider
( 5-30b). Again the verb is the ditransitive tkam 'show', and the first
of the three arguments is the third plural A marked by the prefix mpu3PL A. But in the example, the dative participant is third dual, and this
is a person/ number combination which follows an ergative-absolutive
schema. In these cases there is a distinct set of suffixes for dative partic­
ipants and the proper form here is -mpn 3DL D. Finally, the remaining
core participant urav 'coconut' is realized by its prefix k-, which as the
lower ranking of the two prefixes, occurs initially.
In these analyses, the underlying participant relations of (5-30a,b)
are identical. The differences in structure are accounted for by the same
general split in case marking schema that we saw with transitive verbs:
first and second person work accusatively (nominative-dative schema)
and third person works ergatively (ergative-absolutive-dative schema) .
The main point with ditransitive verbs is that the dative participants
marked with the prefixes identical in form to the 0 prefixes are not in an
0 relation; that is, the grammatical relationship between such a prefix
and its governing ditransitive verb differs from that of the same prefix
with a governing transitive verb. The notion of 0 is an applicable and
useful notion for transitive verbs, but is not extendable to ditransitive
verbs in Yimas. We may summarize the core arguments with the three
basic types of verbs in Yimas as follows,
intransitive verb:
transitive verb:
ditransitive verb:s
A
A0
TDwhere T refers to the theme core argument, that which is shown, given,
etc., i.e., whose location is at issue (Foley and Van Valid 1984). These
can only be third person in Yimas and must always be realized by theTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE N OMINALS211first agreement prefix. A final point to be noted from these examples is
the form of the A prefix in (5-30a) . Compare this to the corresponding
transitive verb in (5-14b). In spite of its preceding the prefix va- 1SG
0, the A actually must appear in the A prefix form mpu- rather than
being optionally neutralized to the S/0 form pu-, as in (5-14b) . This is
because it does not occur initially in (5-30a) , but follows another prefix
k-. This is conclusive proof that the neutralization to the S/0 form
initially for third person prefixes (e.g. , (5-14b) ) is, as claimed, simply a
surface reflex of being in initial position, and nothing more. When not
in initial position, the true A form emerges.
Now we are ready to look in more detail at the morphology of di­
transitive verbs and the dative suffixes. The forms of the dative suffixes
for the three numbers in third person are as follows:
SG
- (n)aknDL
-mpnPL
-mpun(5-31) a. k-ka-tkam-r-akn
VI SG T-1SG A-show-PERF-3SG D
' I showed him (the coconut) . '
b. k-ka-tkam-tuk-nakn
VI SG T-1SG A-show-RM PAST-3SG D
'I showed him (the coconut) long ago.'
c. k-nan-tkam-r-mpun
VI SG T-2PL A-show-PERF-3PL D
'You all show them (the coconut).'
As (5-31a,b) demonstrate, there is some allomorphic variation for the
third singular dative suffix. - akn occurs following a [-peripheral] conso­
nant and - nakn occurs elsewhere.
A salient feature of all three dative suffixes is the final -n. This, of
course, bears a transparent relationship to the oblique suffix -n ,...., - nan.
The dative is in many ways a transitional relation between the true core
relations, represented by A, S, and 0, and the oblique, peripheral re­
lations of location and time (see Foley 1986, 96-8), and these Yimas
dative suffixes clearly seem to be formerly independent pronominal el­
Pments followed by the oblique suffix which have become bound to the
verb and reanalyzed as suffixes. These forms must always occur in ab­
Holute final position in the verb. If another suffix should follow them,
there are suppletive variants of these suffixes which must be used.

b . ta-nan-tkam-r-mpan-JJ

'You all didn't show them (the coconut).'
These suppletive variants may represent the earlier basic forms of the D
suffixes, which were replaced in verb final position by the present day
verb final D suffixes when they became bound to the verb.
These D suffixes almost invariably reference human participants, but
one of the ditransitive verbs, pul- 'rub on', does allow inanimate nouns
to be marked by the dative suffixes. In these cases the noun class of the
inanimate D noun is never indicated, just its number.
(5-33) kacmpt
anti
canoe VIII PL ground VIII SG
i-kay-pul-e-mpun
VIII SG T-lPL A-rub-PERF-3PL D
'We rubbed ground on the canoes.'
kacmpt 'canoes' is a class VIII plural noun functioning as the D argument
of the ditransitive verb pul- 'rub on'. But because the D suffixes only
indicate number, it is impossible to mark its class, and so only its number
is indicated by the D suffix - mpun 3PL D.
Generally the conjugations of ditransitive verbs follow the rules given
earlier for transitive verbs-with the added complication, of course, of
another core argument. Ditransitive verbs associated only with third
person participants differ from the corresponding transitive verbs (5-19)
only in the presence of the D suffixes.

c. makaw
fish (sp) IX SG IX SG T-3PL A-give-PERF-3PL D
'They gave makau to them.'
The fourth inherently ditransitive verb, i- 'tell someone', is constrained
in that its theme argument must always be filled by the verbal prefix
pia-, referring to 'talk, language':THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS213(5-35) a. pia-mpu-i-c-akn
talk T-3PL A-tell-PERF-3SG D
'They told him.'
b. pia-n-i-c-mpun
talk T-3SG A-tell-PERF-3PL D
'He told them.'
Ditransitive verbs with a third person participant and a first or sec­
ond person participant are formed in two ways, depending on which is
A and which is D (we can ignore the theme argument here and in the
following because it is almost invariably inanimate or of relatively low
animacy status and never plays any role in determining the conjugation
of a ditransitive verb) . Because the first or second person participant is
higher ranking by hierarchical principle one, it will occupy the ranking
position of the pronominal prefix closest to the verb. If it functions as
A, it will appear in its proper A prefix form and the third person D will
appear as a D suffix.

c. pia-kay-i-c-akn
talk T-lPL A-tell-PERF-3 SG D
'We told him.'
If, on the other hand, the first or second person participant is the D
argument, it will be realized by the same prefix form as the 0 of a
transitive verb. It will still be the inner prefix because it is the highest
ranked, but the third person A will precede it in the A prefix form,
preceded in turn by the lowest ranking prefix, that for the T argument.

There is no example parallel to (5-37a,b) in which the A is third
singular. We have seen earlier with the transitive verbs that the third
singular form in Yimas is completely homophonous with second singular
and that is the case here. The rules which apply to second person A's214BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYfor ditransitive verbs apply to third singular as well. Ditransitive verbs
with first and second person participants differ in certain respects from
the corresponding transitive verbs. With the exception of verbs with a
first person A and a second singular D, it is not possible to mark both A
and D participants with pronominal prefixes. If the D argument is first
person and the A second person (or third singular), the D argument will
occur as the verb prefix for it is higher ranked. The A, if present at
all, must occur as an independent pronoun. This is in contrast to the
situation with transitive verbs, in which second person A's surface with
the S prefix forms (see (5-27)) .

As can be gleaned from examples (5-38a,d) , verbs without associated
independent pronouns are ambiguous between a second or third person
singular A. These sentences can, of course, be disambiguated by adding
the independent pronoun mi 2SG for second singular or the near distal
deictic form m-n NR DIST-I/II SG 'he, she' for third singular.
Finally, for ditransitive verbs with a first person A and a second
person D, only the situation in which the D argument is second singular
allows marking of both participants on the verb. This is again done by
the suppletive form kampan- ""' mpan-. Number of the first person A
must be indicated by an independent pronoun; without such, singular is
assumed.

If the secopd person D argument is non-singular, then the suppletive
morpheme is not available. Only one of the two participants may be
realized by a verbal prefix, and parallel to the situation with transitive
verbs (5-29), this must be the second person D argument, rather than
the first person A. The A is then expressed through an independent
pronoun. Again, with no overt pronoun, a first person singular A is
assumed, unless context forces otherwise.

If one glances back to the array of pronouns presented in Section 3. 7, he
will note that Yimas actually distinguishes four numbers in its indepen­
dent pronouns: singular, dual, paucal, and plural. The paucal expresses
a set of a few; more than two and usually less than seven, but the ex­
act number varies quite widely according to context. Prototypically,
however, it refers to a class of three to five individuals, and is always
restricted to humans. So far in the exposition of the verbal pronominal
affixes, I have ignored the indication of paucal number. This is because
this number category works rather differently from the other three, and
it seemed simplest to postpone its introduction for ease of exposition. It
is now time to remedy this omission.
The expression of paucal number in a Yimas verb is, in fact, one
of the more complicated parts of the verbal morphology, although its
general pattern is like that outlined above for transitive and ditransi­
tive verbs. Again, there is the pervasive split in behavior between first
and second persons, on the one hand, and third person, on the other.
Basically, first and second person participants with paucal number do
not have distinctive person-number prefixes of their own. These use
the plural prefixes functioning in their normal three way role marking
contrast, in combination with the paucal suffix - vkt (realized as - vkut
by R spreading (rule (2-8)) following a tense suffix containing a fuf,
notably - ntuk RM PAST) . The third person paucal participants have
a distinct set of pronominal prefixes which follow the usual ergative­
absolutive schema for this person. Thus, consider the following paucal
forms for first person.
(5-42) a. pavkra-wa-t
1/2 PC S-go-PERF
'Wefyou few went. '
b . pu-kay-cay-c-vkt
3PL 0-1PL A-see-PERF-PC
'We few saw them.'
c. pu-kra-cay-c-vkt
3PL A-1SG 0-see-PERF-PC
'They saw us few.'
pavkra- is the bound S form for first and second person paucal and is
transparently related to the corresponding independent pronoun pavkt
1/2 PC. For the A and 0 forms there is no distinct paucal form. Rather
the plural prefixes, kay- 1PL A and kra- 1PL 0 are used, in combination
with the paucal suffix - vkt. This paucal suffix is in fact rather like the
third person D suffixes in that it must occur in absolute final positionTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS217TABLE 6Inflection with Pronominal Affixes of Transitive

'km20NEIGHBORING LANGUAGES71 .2 Neighboring Languages
The Yimas language is found in the Sepik river basin area of Papua New
Guinea. It is spoken in two villages along the lower reaches of the Ara­
fundi river, a tributary of the Karawari river, which in turn is a tributary
of the main Sepik river, the great pulsing cultural artery of this region
of New Guinea. Map 1 depicts the linguistic situation in this general
area. Yimas is the southernmost language of the Lower Sepik family, so
that most of the surrounding languages are genetically unrelated to it.
Only directly to the north is a related language, Karawari.
Karawari and Yimas are rather closely related, on the order of Dutch
and German, and form a subgroup within the Lower Sepik family. The
family as a whole will be discussed in some detail in Section 1.4, so only
a few points of close similarity between the two languages will be noted.
Phonologically the two languages are very close, except that Karawari
lacks the palatal lateral, having /r/ as its only liquid. Thus, Yimas /lY/
corresponds to /ri/ in Karawari (Y: palYapa, K: pariapa 'front porch').
Other correspondences are Yimas /r, t/ to Karawari /s/ (Y: triv, K:
sisiv 'tooth'); word initially, Yimas /n/ to Karawari /y/ (Y: nam, K:
yam 'house'); and Yimas /TJ/ for Karawari 0 (Y: varwa, K: arwo 'pe­
nis') . Finally, in the environment of the low vowel /a/ , Yimas /r, t/
correspond to Karawari /y/ (Y: patn, K: payn 'betelnut'; Y: numpran,
K: yimbyan 'pig') .
Morphologically, the two languages are quite similar, but generally
Karawari exhibits a greater simplicity than Yimas. Both languages
have inherited the complex noun class system of Proto-Lower Sepik,
but whereas Yimas has preserved a three-way contrast in number (sin­
gular, dual, and plural) in all classes, Karawari has merged the dual with
the plural in half of its classes, resulting in a simple singular/plural con­
trast for these. Verbs in Karawari are also less elaborate than in Yimas.
Karawari has fewer tense distinctions than Yimas (which has eight), and
also lacks the paucal number suffix of Yimas. Still, the languages are
remarkably similar, even to fine points of detail. For example, instead
of the expected prefix sequence ma-ka for a first-person singular subject
and a second-person singular object, both languages have a suppletive
form kampan-.
To the east of Yimas, along the upper reaches of the Arafundi river,
and in the mountains which constitute its source, lie the villages speak­
ing the Arafundi language. This is spoken by around a thousand people
in ten villages. Dialect differentiation within the Arafundi language is
significant. Until very recently, it was thought to be a language isolate,
but it now seems fairly likely that it is genetically related to the Harwai,
Hagahai and Pinai languages spoken in the mountains further to the8THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSeast in the head waters of the Yuat river. Although there has been some
borrowing of words from Yimas because of long-standing trading contact
(even basic vocabulary like Yimas apwi 'father' into the Wambramas­
Yamandim dialect of Arafundi), Yimas and Arafundi are clearly not
genetically related and are contrastive on all levels. In contrast to the
two-height vowel system of Yimas, Arafundi distinguishes three vowel
heights and adds a length distinction ( yampa 'his fire', ya·mpa 'door'.
The palatal consonants of Yimas seem to be a relatively recent addition
and most are derived by a productive phonological rule of palataliza­
tion (see rule (2-3) in Chapter 2). This claim is buttressed by their
restricted distribution: they cannot occur at the ends of words. Palatals
in Arafundi are strongly established in the phonological system; there
are even two series, !amino-palatals and palatalized velars. The palatals
are basic, underived consonants and occur in most positions of the word,
including finally (nip 'you (DL)').
Morphologically, Arafundi is much simpler than Yimas. Nouns are
not inflected for gender, noun class or number. There is an optional
nominative case marker for nouns, -n, and an accusative case marker
for pronouns, -i. The only other feature for which a noun may be
inflected is its possessor (kot-k hand/foot-1SG POSS 'my hand/foot').
Yimas, like Lower Sepik languages generally, lacks this possibility. All
person/number suffixes in Arafundi fail to distinguish between second­
and third-person in the non-singular numbers. Arafundi verbs are also
much simpler than those of Yimas: there are no prefixes at all (prefixes
being diagnostic of Lower-Sepik family languages), and suffixes are used
for tense and to indicate subject and object (pok-nanci-na-cik hit-2SG
O-FUT-1SG A 'I will hit you'). (A marks the subject of a transitive verb
and 0, its object. I will also employ the abbreviation S for the subject of
an intransitive verb. These are Dixon's (1979) suggestions.) The subject
suffixes are also portmanteau, representing basic tense/aspect/mood dis­
tinctions, a common feature of the languages of the neighboring central
highlands ( ow-k wash-1SG S PERF 'I washed' versus ow-v wash-1SG S
IRR 'let me wash' versus ow-p-cik wash-PROG-1SG S IMPERF 'I am
washing'). This never occurs in Lower Sepik languages. Finally, most
dialects of Arafundi have the typical clause-chaining structures of cen­
tral highlands languages, involving morphologically distinct dependent
verb forms, and make extensive use of switch-reference morphology, as
in this example from the Auwim dialect.

"194BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYNote that the word order in both these sentences is exactly the same,
and further that neither of the nouns have any case marking affixes. Yet
their meanings are contrastive. This meaning difference is carried by
the different choice of verbal prefixes. In the first example, the prefixes
indicate a singular object and a plural subject. The associated plural
noun payum 'men' must therefore be the subject, and the singular noun
narmav 'woman' the object, resulting in 'the men saw the woman'. In
the (b) example, the inflectional pattern of the prefixes is the opposite,
indicating a singular subject and a plural object. Hence, the singular
noun narmav 'woman' must now be the subject and the plural noun
payum 'men', the object, expressing the meaning 'the woman saw the
men'. Note that the verbal affixes signal the grammatical relations of
core nominals rather indirectly: they associate a grammatical relation
with a certain person/number combination. The noun which matches
this person/number combination is then interpreted as filling the gram­
matical relation. If the person/number combinations of the pronominal
affixes are the same, ambiguous sentences may result.
(5-2) panmal narma!J
na-n-tay
man I SG woman II SG 3SG 0-3SG A-see
'The man saw the woman.' or
'The woman saw the man.'
Noun class distinctions may come to the rescue in many cases. This
does not help in (5-2) because, although the two nouns belong to dif­
ferent classes (classes I and II) the verbal prefixes for these clauses are
identical. If, however, the object were a class VI noun, the ambiguity
would disappear.
k-n-tay
narma!J
(5-3) kray!J
frog VI SG woman II SG VI SG 0-3SG A-see
'The woman saw the frog. '
* 'The frog saw the woman.'
The prefix k- VI SG is unambiguously associated with kray'f) 'frog',
which thereby must function as the object. The subject narmav 'woman'
is similarly identified by the prefix n- 3SG A. Hence (5-3) is unambiguous
and can only mean 'the woman saw the frog'.
I have been using the terms subject and object thus far in the exposi­
tion in a pre-theoretical and undefined way. These notions as understood
from the prism of English grammar are not entirely straightforward when
extended to Yimas. The notion of subject in English confiates the sub­
ject of an intransitive and a transitive verb and contrasts these to the
object of a transitive verb. Note, for example, that for the third person
singular masculine pronoun, English uses the same form for the sub-THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS195ject of a transitive and an intransitive verb, but a different form for the
object of a transitive verb:
(5-4) a. He runs.
b. He hit him.
This English way of marking grammatical relations is called a nomin­
ative-accusative system, in which the nominative is the form for the
subject of the intransitive and transitive verb, and the accusative is the
form of the object of the transitive verb. In a system like this, subject is a
well defined notion in that it always corresponds to the nominative form.
Object is equally well defined, always corresponding to the accusative
form.
Yimas is not so straightforward, and the system of grammatical re­
lations as assigned by the prefixes cannot be so simply characterized.
Different person/number combinations work in different ways, but none
align grammatical relations exactly as in English. The prefixes asso­
ciated with third person participants vary in form according to their
position in the verb. There is one form for initial position and another
for non-initial position, as in (5-5):
(5-5) a. pu-wa-t
3PL S-go-PERF
'He went . '
b. pu-n-tay
3PL 0-3SG A-see
'He saw them.'
* 'They saw him. '
c. na-mpu-tay
3SG 0-3PL A-see
'They saw him.'
* 'He saw them.'
Note that when both prefixes refer to third person participants, this
schema based on linear order amounts in essence to an ergative-absolu­
tive marking system. The form pu- 3PL is used for the subject of an
intransitive verb (5-5a) and also functions for the object of a transitive
verb (5-5b) . On the other hand, the subject of the transitive verb has
the unique form mpu- 3PL. (I adopt Dixon's ( 1979) symbolism of S for
the subject of an intransitive verb, A for the subject of a transitive verb
and 0 for its object). We may diagram this contrast in the alignment
of grammatical relations between English and Yimas in the following
terms:196BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY
English:S: he
A: heS: pu-Yimas:
0: himnominative-accusativeA: mpu-0: pu-ergative-absolutiveThe ergative form is that for the A, the subject of the transitive verb­
in this Yimas example, mpu- 3PL. The absolutive corresponds to the
S, the subject of the intransitive verb, and the 0, the object of the
transitive verb-in this case, the prefix pu- 3PL. Note that at least in
these morphological terms, the notion of subject as employed in English
is not applicable to Yimas, for it fails to align A, S, and 0 in the way in
which this term is normally understood.
In fact the situation is more complex than this, for with the first
and second person prefixes, A, S, and 0 typically do not conflate at all,
each one of them having a distinct form, as in these examples of the first
person singular prefixes:
(5-6) a. ama-wa-t
lSG S-go-PERF
'I went.'
b. pu- ka-tay
3PL 0-lSG A-see
'I saw them. '
c. pu- va-tay
3PL A-lSG O-see
'They saw me.'
For the first person singular, ama- is the form for the S, ka- for A, and va­
for 0. (The alert reader will have noted the form pu- for A instead of the
expected mpu-; this is because it occurs initially. As mentioned above,
the form of the third person pronominal prefixes is largely determined
by linear order, as will be discussed in detail below.) These forms for
first singular contrast with those of third plural presented earlier in that
they do not display an ergative system. Instead of aligning S and 0 as
against A as do the third plural forms (pu- S , 0; mpu- A), all three are
distinct. This presents an equally difficult problem for extending the
English notion of subject to Yimas, for again the S fails to align with
A, the morphological defining characteristic of the notion subject for
English and for languages generally with nominative-accusative marking
conventions for grammatical relations.
Having said this, however, there is in fact some morphological evi­
dence in Yimas for a notion of subject along the lines of English. This
evidence appears in secondary verbal forms, particularly those with one
of the modal prefixes (see Section 5.2.2). When one of these modal pre-THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS197fixes is added to a. verb which normally would occur with the S prefix
form, the prefix actually appears as the A form.
(5-7) a. ama-tmuk-t
lSG S-fall-PERF
'I fell down. '
b. ant-ka-tmuk-t
POT-lSG A-fall-PERF
'I almost fell down. '
c.* ant-va-tmuk-t
POT-lSG 0-fall-PERF
(5-7a) is a straightforward verbal form with no modal prefixes in which
the S argument is indicated by the normal S form ama-. (5-7b) is a verb
inflected with the prefix for potential modality ant-, and the S argument
is inflected with the normal A form ka- instead of the expected S form
ama-. As (5-7c) indicates, the 0 prefix va- is ungrammatical in this
construction. Thus, in this construction the S argument surfaces with
the A prefix, rather than the 0 form, demonstrating a clear conflation of
S and A, that is, a nominative-accusative alignment reflecting a notion
of subject much like that of English.
The third person prefixes diverge here. When a modal prefix is added
to a verb with a third person S form prefix, this remains and does not
convert to an A prefix.
(5-8) a. pu-tmuk-t
3PL S-fall-PERF
'They fell down'
b. a-pu-tmuk-r-um
POT-3PL S-fall-PERF-PL
'They almost fell down. '
In (5-8a) , a verbal form without any modal prefix, the normal absolu­
t.ive form pu-, is used to indicate S. When the verb is inflected with the
potential modal prefix ant- (with the allomorph a- for third plural) , the
S form pu- is still used to indicate the S argument, unlike the compara­
ble situation for first and second person S arguments, which would be
i ndicated with the A prefix forms (compare (5-7b)) . So while the first
and second persons betray in their modally inflected verbs an underlying
nominative-accusative argument alignment, the third person does not,
the absolutive form being used in both normal and modally inflected
verbs.
It has already been mentioned that linear order imposes the primary
constraints on the form of verbal prefixes, particularly the third person198BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYones. The pronominal prefixes are normally the initial prefixes to a verb.
The only prefixes which may ever precede them are the modal prefixes.
,
For third person participants, Yimas requires the order 0 prefix-A prefix:
for example, for two third plural participants, pu-mpu- 3PL 0-3PL A.
Yimas has an additional stipulation (to be discussed in detail in the
following section) that the highest participant on a person hierarchy
1 > 2 > 3 should appear to the right, closest to the verb stem. Thus,
in constructions involving a third person A and a first or second person
0, the A will actually appear on the left, in initial position, outranked
for the rightmost position by the 0. Whenever this happens, the third
person A will actually surface in what is typically the 0 prefix form, as
in the following example:
(5-9) pu-nan-tay
3PL A-2SG O-see
'They saw you.'
The prefix pu- 3PL is actually the usual S/0 prefix form, being used
for A because it is in initial position. The normal corresponding A form
would be ungrammatical in this environment.
(5-10) a. * mpu-nan-tay
3PL A-2SG O-see
Interestingly, for some unknown reason, the third plural A form and only
this form may optionally appear in initial position if the 0 is first person
singular.
b. mpu-JJa-tay
1PL A-1SG O-see
'They saw me.'
There is no explanation forthcoming for this anomaly, but it does demon­
strate that the rules determining the forms of the prefixes cannot be
completely put down to linear order. Clearly, (5-lOb) supports the con­
tention that the basic underlying alignment for the third person prefixes
is ergative-absolutive, or A ( mpu-) versus S, 0 (pu- ).
Now when modal prefixes occur, they always occupy the initial prefix
position. Any co-occurring third person prefix must occur in the second
position, the position normally associated with the A form. Yet any
third person participant functioning as S will still surface with the S
prefix form in a verb inflected with a modal prefix.

"THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS229As the A prefix is plural, the plural vaykum 'women' is linked to it and
interpreted as the A. The singular D prefix then links to the singular
noun panmal 'man' which assumes a D participant relation. Note that
if there was no number distinction between these two nouns, the clause
would be ambiguous.
(5-66) :uaykum

wa-mpu-:ua-r-mpun
IX SG T-3PL A-give-PERF-3PL D
'The men gave the women makau.'
'The women gave the men makau. '
As mentioned previously, the word order among noun phrases is free, so
that it does not play a role in disambiguating this clause. Taken out of
context, it must remain ambiguous.
It must be emphasized again that it is the pronominal affixes which
fill the argument positions of the verb, not the noun phrases, and these
latter only receive a participant role interpretation by being in a parat­
actic relationship with a pronominal affix of the same categorical speci­
fications. Given this fact, it is not surprising that in the large majority
of Yimas clauses in ongoing discourse, there are no independent noun
phrases at all. The participant roles are simply filled by the pronominal
affixes; so the following then correspond to (5-65a,b) :
( 5-67) a. ya-mpu-yamal-wat
VIII PL 0-3PL A-carve-HAB
'They usually carve them.'
b. wa-mpu-:ua-r-akn
IX SG T-3PL A-give-PERF-3PL D
'They gave it to them. '
These Yimas verbs would be used in contexts very similar to those of
their English clausal translations: when the referents of the pronomi­
nal affixes had been established in the discourse or context. The noun
phrases are suppressed and their referents tracked simply by the pronom­
inal affixes in Yimas, as the pronouns do in English. However, because
of the difference in grammatical status between the Yimas pronominal
affixes and the English pronouns, and because of the great range of dis­
tinctions made in its affixes, through the systems of noun class, person,
and number, Yimas allows much greater latitude in this feature than
English. For example, in some recitations of traditional legends, impor­
tant props and characters are not introduced through overt nouns, but
only with pronominal affixes. It seems to be assumed that the story line230BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYand characters are so familiar and well known that that is all that is
necessary. Also, the established, old information status of a participant
may persist much longer in Yimas discourse than in English. For exam­
ple, in the Yimas creation legend, there is an important prop which is
introduced and then ignored for a reasonably long stretch of discourse,
about 3 pages; it is then reintroduced, but only through the use of its
corresponding pronominal prefix! This is because, being class VII dual,
a relatively rare combination, there is no chance of confusion with any
other referent. English with its undifferentiated it is too impoverished
morphologically to allow this kind of free pronominalization over such a
long stretch of discourse.
An interesting difference between Yimas and English in this area
concerns translation strategies. I have very often been surprised by the
frequency with which Yimas speakers reference a participant simply by
a pronominal prefix when asked to translate a sentence from Tok Pisin.
For example, when asking for a translation of the Tok Pisin version of
'I bought betelnut', one may very well get:
(5-68) na-ka-wayk-t
V SG 0- lSG A-buy-PERF
'I bought it'
in which na- V SG 0 is the only overt indication of the class V singular
noun patn 'betelnut'. I have made no study of this, but I conjecture that
if English speakers were asked to translate the same Tok Pisin sentence
into English it is highly unlikely the noun would be omitted. I believe
this again reflects the basic difference between these pronominal affixes
and English pronouns: the pronominal affixes fill the argument slots of
the verb, and a clause is complete with just them. The noun phrases
are indirectly and paratactically linked to the verb through these affixes.
They may be omitted freely if they correspond to established referents.
On the other hand, in English the noun phrases themselves, whether
they be nouns or pronouns, fill these argument slots of the verb. So in
parroting back a clause in translation, it is straightforward and expected
that the speaker will simply repeat the nouns of the prompt sentence,
given that the noun phrase positions of an English clause must be filled
if it is to be complete.
An additional argument for regarding the affixes as filling the verbal
argument positions concerns the indication of paucal number. Paucal
number is predominantly a verbal category; with the exception of the
pronouns and deictics for humans, no noun phrases exhibit overt inflec­
tion for paucal, i.e., the plural number covers the range of paucal as well.
Consider the following example:THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS231(5-69) namat
patn
na-!Jkl-wayk-t
men I PL betelnut V SG V SG 0-3PC A-buy-PERF
'The few men bought betelnut. '
Assuming that the pronominal affixes fill the argument positions, this
example is easy to analyze. The A prefix vkl- 3PL A is third person
and paucal. Searching for a noun phrase which shares these features
we come across the class I plural noun namat 'men'. Knowing that the
equation paucal = plural holds for all nouns, we conclude that namat
'men' is linked to vkl- 3PL A, and it is interpreted to function in the A
role.
Now consider an analysis with the opposite assumption: that the
noun phrases really fill argument slots of the verb and the pronominal
affixes are just automatic copies of these onto the verb. Example (569) now becomes problematic because namat is morphologically plural
and should therefore be copied by the plural A prefix, mpu-. One could
argue, of course, that namat is actually specified as paucal, and that it
just happens that paucal and plural are homophonous. But this seeming
harmless coincidence happens throughout the language: no Yimas noun
distinguishes paucal from plural number. This analysis requires us to
posit a morphological category for Yimas nouns which never has any
overt realization for them. The previous analysis, with the pronominal
prefixes only filling argument positions, has no such requirement and is
therefore to be preferred.
Still another piece of evidence concerns verbal pronominal prefixes
with conjoint reference. Consider this example:
impa-wa-ntut
( 5-70) panmal
narma!J
man I SG woman II SG 3DL S-go-RM PAST
'The man and woman went . '
I have already presented arguments that Yimas does not permit nounphrases composed of conjoined nouns in Section 4.6. Hence panmal
'man' and narmav 'woman' cannot form a constituent in this example
to trigger the dual number specification for the S prefix on the verb
impa- 3 DL S. Rather this is specified independently and fills the S ar­
p;ument position for this verb. This is then linked to both singular nouns
paratactically, integrating both of them to fill out the dual specification
of the S prefix.
A final argument concerns the phenomenon of possessor raising to
he discussed in detail in Section 6.2.3.2. In this construction, a human
possessor of a core argument of the verb is promoted to function in its
own right as a core argument marked by a D affix.","[250, 251, 252, 253]"
"THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS199This example demonstrates that the basic underlying ergative-absolutive
basis of the third person prefixes weighs more heavily in determining
their form than the constraints imposed by linear order. Here the third
person plural S participant is still coded by the S form pu- and not the
A form mp u-, in spite of the fact that it occurs in the normal second
position of the A prefix. Thus, for third person prefixes, linear order can
cause an A participant to be coded by a S or 0 prefix form if outranked
by a first or second person 0 participant, as in (5-9) (although that is
only optional if the 0 participant is first person) . But it will not cause an
S participant to be indicated by an A prefix form even if its pronominal
prefix occurs in second position, the normal position of A, as a result of
a modal prefix preceding it.
This does happen, however, with first and second person partici­
pants. There, the accusative pattern with modally inflected verbs re­
ally does reflect the underlying pattern, for there are no linear order
constraints prohibiting the A or the 0 prefix from occurring in second
position (look back at examples (5-6b,c)). The S prefix forms for first
and second person participants are closely related to the correspond­
ing independent pronoun forms (see Section 5.1.2), and in most cases
simply seem to be these pronouns bound to the verb stem. No other
prefixes are allowed to precede these normal S forms. The other two
prefixes for first or second person participants-those for A and 0-do
allow prefixes to precede them, typically a prefix for a third person core
participant (again see examples (5-6b,c)) . When a verb with an associ­
ated S participant is inflected with a modal prefix, one of the two prefix
forms which allow a preceding prefix must be chosen, and it must be
that which would normally mark an A.
(5-12) a. ant-ka-tmuk-t
POT-lSG A-fall-PERF
'I almost fell down. '
b. * ant-va-tmuk-t
POT-lSG 0-fall-PERF
Both examples illustrate first person singular S participants, but this
participant must be realized by the A prefix form ka- (5-12a) and not the
0 form va- (5-12b) . Given what has been presented about the language
HO far, either option could be expected, but the fact that the language
chooses the A form to reference an S participant clearly identifies an
accusative pattern. S and A are conflated here rather than the ergative
pattern of S and 0. This fact clearly argues that underlying the usual
three-way split of role marking for first and second person participants,
i .e . , treating all three distinctly (as is found with verbs without modalBASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY200inflection) , is a basic nominative-accusative schema, which conflates S
and A and opposes this to 0 . We will see more evidence for this claim
as the exposition proceeds.
5.1.2 The Prefixes and Their Combinations
The pronominal prefixes in Yimas for each of the three functions A,
S , and 0 and for all person-number combinations are presented below.
The independent pronouns for first and second persons also appear for
comparison with the S forms (there are, of course, no true pronouns for
third person, that function being simply filled by the various deictics for
the different noun classes discussed in Chapter 4).

miThe person-number combinations are arranged in what seems to be a
rough Silversteinian hierarchy of feature markedness (Silverstein 1976).
Only the highest ranked combination, first dual, fails to distinguish A
and 0. It uses the same prefix vkra- 1DL for both A and 0 and contrasts
this to an S form kapa-, derived in the typical fashion from the indepen­
dent pronoun kapa 1DL. Verbs using this vkra- 1DL are ambiguous
between the A and 0 interpretation.
(5-13) pu-vkra-tay
3PL A/0-lDL A/0-see
'We two saw them.' or
'They saw us two.'
Note that the 3PL prefix is of no help in disambiguating the construction,
because, since it occupies the initial position, it must appear in the S/0
form regardless of whether it is functioning as A or 0.
The remaining combinations for first and second person all have dis­
tinct forms for A and 0 and, with a distinct form for S, (which is trans­
parently the bound form of the corresponding independent pronoun) ,
all exhibit a three-way split in their role marking schema. Only for the
second singular S form ma-, is there any difference from the independentTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS201pronoun, in this case mi 2SG. Transitive verbs involving these prefixes
are always unambiguous in their role indications.
(5-14) a. pu-ka-tay
3PL 0-1SG A-see
'I saw them.'
b. pu-IJa-tay
3PL A-1SG O-see
'They saw me.'
Finally, all third person prefixes operate on an ergative-absolutive role­
marking schema, conflating S and 0 and opposing this to the A form,
as in the following:
(5-15) a. pu-n-tay
3PL 0-3SG A-see
'He saw them.'
b. na-mpu-tay
3SG 0-3PL A-see
'They saw him.'
A curious anomaly in the Yimas paradigm of verbal pronominal pre­
fixes is the coincidence in form of the A prefix for second and third sin­
gular. This coincidence only applies in combinations of second singular
with third person, for in combinations with first person, other consid­
erations are operative, as we shall see below. But this coincidence does
create ambiguity in a number of verbal forms as seen in the examples
below.
(5-16) a. pu-n-tay
3PL 0-2/3 SG A-see
'You/he saw them.'
b. na-n-tay
3SG 0-2/3SG A-see
'You/he saw him.'
A similar problem of ambiguity afflicts the 0 prefix for second singular.
Notice that its form nan- is homophonous with the A prefix for second
plural, so that again verbal forms involving third person participants are
ambiguous.
(5-17) a. pu-nan-tay
3PL A-3SG O-see
'They saw you.'
b. pu-nan-tay
3PL 0-2PL A-see
'You all saw them.'","[220, 221, 222, 223]"
"5Basic Verbal MorphologyThe verb is by far the most morphologically complex word class in Yi­
mas. Much of this complexity derives from elaborate processes of deriva­
tion and root compounding which will be the focus of the next chapter.
In this chapter I will discuss what would in traditional terms be described
as verbal inflection, although as we shall see, a sharp line between ver­
bal inflection and verbal derivation is very difficult to draw in Yimas.
Specifically, this chapter will deal with the inflectional system for tense,
aspect, and mood, as well as the pronominal affixes for the core argu­
ments. Because Yimas lacks any case marking on nominals functioning
as core arguments, these pronominal affixes serve as the primary device
signalling grammatical relations in the language. Since the pronominal
affixes can cause allomorphic variation in the tense/aspect/mood sys­
tem, I will begin with them. As the exposition will demonstrate, the
inflection of Yimas verbs with pronominal affixes is very complex. The
possibilities are summarized in Tables 5-7 at the end of Section 5.1.3.
5.1 The Pronominal Affix System for Core Nominals
5.1.1 The Basic Schema for Role Marking
As mentioned above, it is the verbal pronominal affixes on a Yimas verb
which indicate the semantic roles of its associated core nominals. These
function like case marking in languages like Latin or Sanskrit or word
order in languages like English or Indonesian. Consider the following
two examples:
narmaiJ
na-mpu-tay
( !""1- l) a. payum
man I PL woman II SG 3SG 0-3PL A-see
'The men saw the woman. '
b. payum
pu-n-tay
r..armaiJ
man I PL woman II SG 3PL 0-3SG A-see
'The woman saw the men.'","[213, 214, 215]"
"LOCATIONALS107Examples of these locational postpositions are given below:
pawmpn
'underneath' (trees)
'at the bottom, below' u rnkun
mawn
'above, at the top'
akpJlan
'behind'
wampuJlan
'in front of'
wampuun < wampu!J 'heart' + -n OBL
'inside'
tapukapn < tapukap 'outside' + -n OBL
'outside'
'outside' + -n OBL
'at the side of'
ayukn
< ayuk
Some of these are transparently derived from nouns by affixing the
oblique suffix. A few other locational words are still nouns because
they can be pluralized. Examples are kcpn 'space underneath a house',
PL: kcpnkat 'the spaces underneath houses'; and mawvkwat 'the other
side', PL: mawvkwara 'the spaces on or at the sides of a dwelling or
object'.
Although these looational postpositions most commonly occur in
postpositional phrases, they may also be used as free locationals. In
this sense, they are like English prepositions, as in John slept inside
versus John slept inside the house. So compare the following examples:
(3-27) a. akru
yampauk-n
mawn k-na-taw-n
frog VI SG head VI SG-OBL above VI SG-DEF-sit-PRES
' The frog is on top of (his) head.'
b. akru
mawn k-na-taw-n
frog VI SG above VI SG 8-DEF-sit-PRES
'The frog is on top.'
In the second example, the location which the frog is above is left unspec­
ified. It is either the position of some object inferred from the context
or may be taken to be the position of the speech event itself or some
event reported in the discourse.
Yimas has four other postpositions which may perhaps be treated
here and squeezed into the class of locationals, although they contrast
from those postpositions treated thus far in some important respects.
These postpositions are
nampan
'toward, for, because of'
nampayn
'like'
'toward, at the house/residence/property of (French chez ) ' naukun
kantk
' with, together'
These grammatical postpositions contrast with the locational postpo­
Hitions in that the preceding noun is never marked with the oblique
caHe suffix. Hence, these grammatical postpositions function like case108WORD CLASSESmarkers themselves, and this explains why they have more abstract re­
lational meanings in contrast to the concrete locational meanings of the
locational postpositions. Besides being postpositions, another feature
shared by members of both types is their ability to become specified
through prefixes to the verb. When this happens with a locational post­
position, the associated noun remains oblique, but with a grammatical
postposition, it becomes a core argument cross-referenced by a verbal
agreement prefix. Consider the following examples:
(3-28) a. panmal
numpk-n
mawn
man I SG mountain V SG-OBL above
na-na-taw-n
3SG S-DEF-sit-PRES
'The man is on top of the mountain.'
b. panmal
numpk-n
na-na-wi-caw-n
man-I SG mountain V SG-OBL 3SG 8-DEF-above-sit-PRES
'The man is on top on the mountain.'
(3-29) a. panmal IJaykum
kantk na-na-wa-n
man I SG woman-11 PL with 3SG-DEF-go-PRES
'The man is going with the women.'
b. panmal IJaykum
pu-na-taiJ-wa-n
man I SG woman II PL 3PL 0-3SG A-DEF-COM-go-PRES
'The man is going with the women.'
In (3-28a) the oblique noun numpuk-n 'mountain' is followed by the
postposition, mawn 'above', while in (3-28b) the oblique noun occurs
by itself, and the notion of 'above' is expressed by the verbal elevational
prefix wi- 'above', which triggers palatization of the following /t/. (For
a detailed discussion of elevational prefixes, see Section 6.3.3.) Sentences
(3-28) (a) and (b) are not perfectly synonymous in all senses. (3-28a)
would normally be taken to mean 'the man is at the top of the mountain'.
Although the reading 'the man is above (us, where the speech act occurs)
on the mountain' is possible, it is definitely not preferred. (3-28b) has
the exact opposite ranking of preferred readings. It would normally
be taken to mean 'the man is above (us, where the speech act occurs)
somewhere on the mountain'. The reading 'the man is at the top of the
mountain' could only be a special case of the former reading, a discourse­
based inference. Thus, the structural difference between a locational
postposition and a verbal elevational prefix reflects a difference in the
preferential readings of the scope of ' above'. As a locational postposition,
it is primarily taken as a modifier of its oblique head noun, while as
a verbal elevational prefix, it is taken as a modifier of the verb and,TEMPORALS109more widely, the speech act. Note that this same contrast is carried in
English by the choice of the prepositions of versus on (see the English
translations of ( 3-28a, b)).
The examples (3-29a, b) are different in two respects. The noun
vaykum 'women' is not case marked by the oblique suffix, but is directly
followed by the postposition kantk 'with'. When the concept of 'with'
is expressed by the comitative verbal prefix tav-, naykum is necessar­
ily a core argument. This is demonstrated by its corresponding verbal
prefix pu-, which agrees with the noun in terms of number/class fea­
tures. (For a detailed discussion of the notion of core arguments and the
function of valence-increasing verbal affixes like tav- COM, see Section
6.2.3.3. These two examples also contrast with the previous two in that
they are absolutely synonymous. As far as can be determined, there
is no difference in sense whatsoever between (3-29) (a) and (b) . There
are pragmatic differences, however, concerning the contrastiveness of
vaykum 'women' (see Section 5.1.6).
In their true postpositional use, all four grammatical postpositions
require human (or at least higher animate) nouns or pronouns as their
objects. kantk has another adjectival-like use to express possession and
then is often found with inanimate object nouns, but that is not of
concern here (see Section 4.5) . nampan, navkun, and nampayn contrast
with kantk in that their objects, when pronouns, must be in the form
of the bound possessive prefixes (see Section 4.5). This is prohibited for
kantk, whose pronoun objects must be the free forms.

'for them'mpu-nalJkun

'toward their house'mpu-nampayn
3PL-like

3PL with
'with them'3.6 Temporals
Temporals express the time setting of an action. Temporals are of two
types in Yimas, basic temporals and nouns metaphorically used as tem­
porals. Basic temporals are themselves of several types:General temporals:muntawktn
kal]kran
tampin
mpa'at first'
'before, early'
'after, later'
'now, already'Parts of the day:kratut
tumpntut
aJ]kayapan
wut'twilight' (5:00-6:00)
'morning' (6:00-9:00)
'late afternoon' ( 17:00-19:00)
'night' ( 19:00-5:00)WORO CLASSES1 10There is no specific word to refer to the main part of the day from about
9:00-17:00 hours. The general word tmal 'sun, day' can be used for
this period, and more specifically, the phrase kpa tmal 'big sun' can be
used for the middle, hottest part of the day. In parallel fashion, kpa
wut 'big night' can be used to refer to the period around midnight. In
addition speakers often use the Tok Pisin word belo 'noon' for the very
specific period between 12:00-13:00, when government offices are closed,
and people would have lunch in the towns.
Day counters:kwarkwa
IJarlJ
urakr!J
tnwant!J
kampraJlCIJ
manmaJlCIJ'today'
'one day removed'
(i.e., 'yesterday, tomorrow')
'two days removed'
'three days removed'
'four days removed'
'five days removed'Yimas has the interesting, but not unusual, Papuan system of reckoning
time from the point 'now' Janus-like in both directions, so that one day
in the past (yesterday) and one day in the future (tomorrow) are both
denoted by the same term varr). The actual time referred to by varr.J is
distinguished by the choice of tense on the verb, near past (yesterday)
versus near future (tomorrow) (see Section 5.2.1).
Yimas also has two basic nouns used metaphorically as temporals.
These nouns contrast with all previous temporals in that when they are
used as temporals, they must be suffixed with the oblique case suffix.
mlantrm-nan
moon, month V DL-OBL
'in two months'tmat-jlan
sun, day V SG-OBL
'during the day'They are, however, not the only temporals which some morphological
features of nouns. A few temporal words from all types except the
general temporals may form close-knit noun phrases with the adjective
ma- 'other' to mean 'on another ' Such noun phrases formed with the
temporal nouns or the words for parts of the day occur with the oblique
suffix.
_rna
tmat-jlan
other sun, day V SG-OBL
'on another day'.rna
wut(-Jlan)
other night(-OBL)
'on another night'The oblique suffix is optional with wut, but required with tmal. 'l)arr.J
from the class of day counters also forms this construction, but is pro­
hibited from taking the oblique suffix.","[128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"
"384INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSThe verb in (7-20a) lacks any valence decreasing affix so, being a bivalent
verb, it must be associated with two core arguments, an A n- 3SG A and
an 0 na- 3SG 0. The contrastive pronoun panawt 'self' must be linked
to the A participant above, deriving the meaning 'he killed him himself'.
The verb in the reflexive example (7-2b), while semantically bivalent, is
formally intransitive. Further, pan- is marked with the oblique suffix so
may not function as a core argument. Thus, the single core argument
m-n 'he' is an S acting on himself, and hence the reflexive reading of the
construction.
As can be gleaned from the preceding examples, these contrastive
pronouns only mark gender and number. Person must be expressed
through an appositional independent pronoun or deictic ( mi pan-mav
2SG self-F SG 'you, yourself'; kapa pan-mampan-an lDL self-M DL-OBL
'both of us, ourselves'; m-um pan-put NR DIST-Il PL self-F PL 'those,
themselves'). The pronoun or deictic can be left out if the referent is
clear from the immediate context, and in any case, deictics are commonly
omitted with the contrastive pronouns. If a contrastive pronoun occurs
alone (7-18b), it is normally interpreted as third person unless contextual
features determine otherwise.
Complementation
Complementation is one of the most interesting and elaborated parts of
Yimas grammar, and is remarkably different in a number of ways from
the system of complements in many other languages, including other
Papuan languages. Complements are not all that common in Yimas
formal narrative discourse, but in everyday speech and conversation they
are frequently encountered.
Complements in Yimas are typically nominalizations and are formed
with - ru NFN. In other words, in order for a clause (the complement) to
function as an argument of another clause (the main or matrix clause),
it must be made non-finite through the process of nominalization. Com­
plement nominalizations are like nouns and nominals generally in being
affixed with suffixes to mark noun class; we have already seen this with
the suffixes - awt M SG, etc. It is these class suffixes which indicate the
different types of complements. In addition to the agentive nominaliza­
tions marked by - awt M SG, etc., there are four types of complements in
Yimas: complements of speech or language, marked by -mpwi; comple­
ments of desire (-wampuv ) , complements of action (-nti), and comple­
ments of customary action (-wal) . The semantics of each type will be
discussed below, but first I wish to present the general syntactic features
of Yimas complementation structures.
The first point about Yimas nominalized complements is that they
7.1.2NON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS385have the basic syntactic structure of compounds. Remember that Yimas
possesses a productive means of forming verb plus noun compounds
using the - t allomorph of -ru NFN (see Section 4.4).
(7-21) a. ayk-t
yaw
yua-0
yak
marry-NFN road IX SG good-IX SG COP IX SG
'That's a proper match of marriage partners.'
tpuk
ku-n-kacapal
b. am-t
eat-NFN sago pancake X SG X SG 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot his sago for eating.'
The compounds in (7-21) are very close to complements. If we replace
the head noun of the compound in (7-21b) with complement markers
and specifically that of the complement of desire, - wampuv (nothing but
the class V noun meaning 'heart'), we derive a parallel complementation
structure of almost morpheme-for-morpheme similarity.
na-n-kacapal
(7-22) tpuk
am-tu-wampu:u
sago pancake )\ SG eat-NFN-heart V SG V SG 0-3SG A-forget
'He lost interest in eating sago.'
In (7-22) the head noun of the compound is wampuv 'heart', the indi­
cator of a complement of desire. This is what is marked on the verb as
the 0 participant by na- V SG 0, the class and number specifications
for wampuv 'heart'.
It is also possible for class markers by themselves to function as the
heads of verb plus noun compounds either with or without an overt
coreferential noun.
(7-23) a. tpuk
am-t-u:u
ku-n-kacapal
sago pancake X SG eat-NFN-X SG X SG 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot his sago for eating.'
b. am-t-u:u
ku-n-kacapal
eat-NFN-X SG X SG 0-3SG A-forgot
'He forgot his (sago) for eating.'
Example (7-23a) differs from (7-21b) in that the order of verb plus noun
has been altered, changing the embedding structure of modifier plus
head to one of two appositional nominals of the same class and number,
the second being headed by the class marker -uv X SG. This alternation
is no different from that involving possessors or adjectives.
(7-24) a. ama-na matn
1SG-POSS brother I SG
versus
ama-na-kn
matn
brother I SG 1SG-POSS-I SG
'my brother'INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS386b. kpa kay
big canoe VIII SG
versuskay
kpa-y
canoe VIII SG big-VIII SG
'a big canoe'
Example (b) in (7-23) is simply the second nominal in the appositional
arrangement of (7-23a) standing on its own. This clause would be used
whenever the context makes it clear what referent denoted by a class
X SG noun is being talked about (expressed by the suffix - uv X SG),
just as kpa-y big-VIII SG would generally be all that is necessary in a
discourse about canoes.
The examples in (7-23) are again very closely paralleled by comple­
ment structures.
(7-25) a. tpuk
am-tu-mpwi pia-n-kacapal
sago pancake X SG eat-NFN-talk talk 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot to eat sago.'
b. am-tu-mpwi pia-n-kacapal
eat-NFN-talk talk 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot to eat.'
In (7-25) the class marker - mpwi 'talk' is used to mark a nominalized
complement of speech; the complements could express the A partici­
pant's thoughts (thoughts are regarded as internal speech in Yimas), or
could paraphrase an order or exhortation directed to the A which was
forgotten. The class marker -mpwi 'talk' functions as the head of these
nominalized complements, so that in fact they have the syntactic struc­
ture of verb plus noun compounds. Since compounds have the following
syntactic structure,
(7-26)
N
---- ----s---- ---V
I
INNmawrun
enemyi!]kay
tu-t

'spears for killing enemies'
nominalized complements can be represented in rather the same way.
The complement in (7-22) has the structure (7-27), and (7-25) that of
(7-28).","[405, 406, 407, 408]"

3.7 Pronouns
Yimas has a very rich inventory of pronominal forms, but most of these
are bound morphemes and will be discussed in the relevant sections of
the morphology. I will only be concerned here with pronouns which
are free independent words. True pronouns in Yimas only belong to
the first- and second-persons, i.e., refer to the speaker and addressee.
The so-called third-person pronouns refer to participants absent, or not
directly interacting in the immediate, ongoing speech act, and belong
to the word class of deictics in Yimas, to be treated in the following
section.
Besides two persons, Yimas distinguishes four numbers in its pro­
nouns: singular, dual, paucal (a few: from three up to about seven,
but variable depending on context) , and plural. The basic independent
pronouns are
DL
PC
PL
SG
1 ama
kapa
paukt
ipa
2 mi
kapwa
paukt
ipwa
I t. should be noted that for the non-singulars, the second-person formsderived from the first by an infix -w- (this goes back to Proto-Lower
S1�pik; see Foley 1986, 220-1). In fact, in the paucal there is no difference
whatsoever; the two forms are homophonous, the distinction being made
hy cross-referencing verbal person/number prefixes.
Compared to English, these pronouns are used relatively infrequently,
t.lwir basic categories being normally expressed by prefixes to the verb
(Hm� Section 5.1). The free pronouns can be used in combination withare112WORD CLASSESthe verbal prefixes, but then the pragmatic effect is generally contrastive,
i.e., ' it 's me (not you or anyone else) who . . . ' (see Section 5.1.6).
3.8 Deictics
As with many languages, deictics are a rather elaborated part of Yi­
mas grammar. The basic function of a deictic is to locate the position
of an object in space (or in some languages, in time (Becker 1974))
with respect to the positions of the participants in the speech act. The
basic participants in a speech act are the speaker, the addressee, and
the person spoken about (absent from the immediate speech act, but
nonetheless one of its topics). Yimas has a deictic stem corresponding
to each of these three positions. There is a deictic stem -k 'this (near
me)' to refer to things close to the speaker, a stem m- 'that (near you)'
for those close to the addressee and a stem - n 'that yonder (near neither
you nor me) '. All deictics agree in number and noun class with the noun
denoting the objects whose location they are specifying. The proximal
deictic -k and the far distal deictic - n take the set of verb prefixes, while
the near distal deictic m- takes the adjectival suffixes. So for class VII
we would have the following set of nine forms:
-n FR DIST
-k PROX
m- NR DIST
SG
m-n
p-k
p-n
pla-n
pla-k
mpl
DL
PL
pia-n
pia-k
m-rampl 'those two' is a contraction from m- the near distal stem plus - mpl
the adjectival class VII dual suffix.
These deictic forms can be used as modifiers of head nouns (like
adjectives) or as noun phrases in their own right (like pronouns). When
used like adjectives they most commonly occur after the head noun,
as in imp ram pk 'this basket', but this is by no means obligatory, and
the opposite order is also found, pk impram. The former are sometimes
elliptical versions of predicative uses of the deictics with the usual copula
deleted. So we would have examples like the following
(3-30) impram
p-k
papk
basket VII SG VII SG-PROX COP VII SG
'This is a basket.'
The copula in Yimas is a highly complex verb form with many irregu­
larities (see Section 5.1.5) . It agrees for person, number, and class with
the noun it predicates (in the above example, class VII SG) . The forms
of the copula with different person, number, and class combinations are
presented in Section 5.1.5. In the singular (and only for some classes)
the copula makes an additional distinction usually associated with de-DEICTICS113ictics in a number of languages. In these classes, there are two forms in
the singular for the copula, one used for objects which are visible and
one for things invisible.
aykk
(3-31) a. anti
ground VIII SG COP VIII SG VIS
'It's ground (seen) .'
b. anti
ayk
ground VIII SG COP VIII SG INVIS
'It's ground (unseen) . '
(3-32) a . awruk

kawk
bandicoot X SG X SG-PROX COP X SG VIS
'This is a bandicoot (seen) . '
b. awruk
akuk
bandicoot X SG COP X SG INVIS
'It's a bandicoot (unseen).'
The (a) examples above use the visible copula forms and identify ob­
jects seen by the speaker. These are largely identificational uses of the
copula, rather than predicational: the (a) examples would be uttered in
a context when the speaker is holding up a bandicoot or a lump of dirt
and identifying what it is. The (b) examples are used when describing
objects unseen by the speaker and largely correspond to predicational
uses of the copula. For example, (3-32b) would be uttered if on walking
through the bush one heard a rustling sound in the grass, while (331b) would be said if on swimming through the lakes one stood up and
touched bottom. (3-30), with a visible copula form, also corresponds to
a predicational usage and would be a likely answer to a question like
'what are you making?', asked while watching someone weaving. As the
object being woven is visible to both parties in this context, this demon­
�·ltrates that the semantic contrast of visible versus invisible is more basic
than that between identificational and predicational uses. In most cases
the two meanings coincide, so it is in fact difficult to extricate them.
AH mentioned above, the visible/invisible contrast is only found in the
singular and only with some classes; for further discussion of the uses of
the copula and a complete listing of all forms, see Section 5.1.5.
These deictics also function in Yimas as the third-person pronouns.
The unmarked form in this usage is the near distal deictic. In ongoing
narrative discourse, it is this set of forms which are most commonly
used as free pronouns. But in direct quotes in and in normal everyday
('onversational discourse, all three basic forms are employed with the
following meanings. Forms based on the proximal deictic stem -k are
used to refer to participants or objects within the immediate contextWORD CLASSES1 14of the speech act. So in talking about a child sitting next to the two
interlocutors, one would use the form na-k, the proximal form for class
I and II singular, the classes for human beings. The choice between the
near distal and the far distal stems is more subtle. If one wishes to
emphasize the position of the participant or object as being near the
addressee, one could use the near distal stem. Similarly, if one wishes to
emphasize its distance from both major participants, one could use the
far distal form. But both of these reasons for their use would be unusual
and would result in a quite emphatic reading on the deictic, i.e., 'that
thing right here near you' or 'that thing which is certainly far away, not
near you or me'. More commonly, the choice of the near or far distal
deictic stem reflects the centrality of the participant in the discourse or
the speaker's empathy toward it. So, for example, one would talk about
a child using m-n, the near distal form for classes I and II singular, if
he was a central participant in the discourse or we felt good feelings
toward him. The far distal form na-n, on the other hand, is likely to be
used if we are angry at the child or if he is of only passing, secondary
interest.
Corresponding to each of the deictic stems is deictic adverb of place.
These are formed from the same stems plus an affix.
ta-k
m-nti
ta-n'here (near me)'
'there (near you)'
'there (near neither me nor you)'Again the stems -k and -n occur with a prefix in this case ta-, while
m has a suffix - nti. These forms are closely related to the interrogative
deictic, meaning 'where'. Yimas has a stem vka, meaning 'where?',
to which is added the same set of prefixes found on the deictic stems
-k and -n. The basic form is ta-vka 'where', which is used when the
location of an action is queried or when the speaker wishes to be vague
about the object whose location is requested. In all other cases in which
the location of a known object is being sought, the stem -vka must be
prefixed with the proper verbal prefix for the class of the object. Quite
clearly, in Yimas the word 'where?' is a verb. Consider the following
question in (a) with its answer in (b) , employing the class VII singular
noun impram 'basket'.
(3-33) a. impram
p-uka?
basket VII SG VII-where
'Where is the basket?'
tampaymp-n
b. impram
basket VII SG hook VII SG-OBLDEICTICS115p-na-apca-mpi-irm-n
VII SG 8-DEF-hang-SEQ-stand-PRES
'The basket is hanging on the hook. '
In the interrogative (a) sentence, the - vka 'where?' functions as the main
verb, taking the normal verbal prefix for its nominal argument. -vka is
a rather defective verb. It cannot be inflected for any typically verbal
categories like tense, mood, or aspect, nor can it mark the number of its
nominal argument by the prefix; it can mark only class.
Other interrogative words in Yimas are:
(who-SG)
'who (SG)'
naw-n
'who (DL)'
naw-rm
(who-DL)
(who-PC)
' who (PC)'
naw-ukt
(who-PL)

'what kind'
wara-t-awt
(how many-act)
ntuk-nti
'how much, how many'
ntuk-mpat
(how many-VII PL)
'when'
As can be clearly seen many of these interrogative words are based on
the stem wara 'what' plus suffixes of nominalizations and complements.
This suggests that like -vka 'where' , wara also has verbal characteristics.
Another set of words to be considered in this section are adverbs of
manner derived from the deictics of place. These are formed by adding
the adverbial suffix - mpi to the proximal and near distal adverbs:
tak 'here' + -mpi > takmpi 'like this'
mnti 'there' + -mpi > mntmpi 'like that'
Interestingly, this suffix can be added to the word tavka 'where?' to
form a derived verb (further demonstrating its status as a verb), as in
the following example:
(3-34) tauka-mpi ya-n-ntak-t
mnta
where-ADV V PL 0-2SG A-leave-PERF then
ma-ya-t
2SG S-come-PERF
'You left (things) where and now you came?'
Here the things left behind are left unspecified, cross-referenced by the
vague, unmarked plural prefix ya- (probably understood as referring to1 16WORD CLASSESthe noun maramara 'things, possessions') . There is no real semantic con­
trast between this sentence and one with the underived tavka, although
the tavkampi form is more likely to be used with action verbs ( espe­
cially motion verbs) and tavka with stative or position verbs. Perhaps
a more accurate translation, then, of tavkampi would be 'in a where-ing
manner? '.
Finally, there are two stems, which on morphological and to a certain
extent semantic grounds, seem best assigned to the deictic word class.
These are kawvkwan- 'something like _' and mntn- 'this sort of _'.
Like the near distal deictic stem m-, these take the adjectival concord
suffixes indicating the class and number of their modified noun.
(3-35) a. anti

'something like land.'

c. yara

'these sorts of trees. '
3 . 9 Conjunctions
Yimas has only three conjunctions tay 'and then', mnta 'and then' and
kanta 'but'. The second two are obviously built on a stem - nta, to which
is added the near distal deictic stem m- or a negative prefix ka-. Both
of these are coordinating conjunctions. Yimas lacks a disjunctive coor­
dinating conjunction, i.e., 'or' , and all subordinating conjunctions. The
meanings of the latter are expressed through bound affixes to verbs,
sometimes in combination with temporal stems. The conjunction tay
normally introduces a new sentence, but may function to conjoin clauses
within a single sentence. The other two conjunctions kanta and mnta
normally occur after the first element of the second clause they are con­
joining, rather than between the two clauses (as do their English equiv­
alents), although that position is also possible. Consider this example:mnta
(3-36) i-kay-api-wat

The obvious conclusion to be drawn from the contrast in syntactic
behavior between (4-60a) and (4-60b) is that (4-60a), without posses­
sive agreement, is a noun phrase, but (4-60b), with it, is not. The latter
construction is a scrambled paratactic construction, with the two nom­
inals in apposition to each other (as we will argue below). In addition
to these structural differences there is a semantic difference between
the (a) and (b) constructions, as demonstrated by the choice of nouns
in (4-60a) and (4-60b). The unaffixed (a) construction is largely re­
stricted to possessed kin terms. These are the only possessed nouns
for which it is commonly heard spontaneously and indeed is highly fa­
vored for them. The (a) construction with other types of nouns, while
grammatical, is only marginally so and is rarely encountered. The (b)
construction with the p�ssessive agreement suffix is much preferred with
non-kin nouns. It could be argued that this difference reflects a distinc­
tion between alienable and inalienable possession, but, since classically
inalienably possessed nouns such as body parts occur in the (b) con­
struction (as well as the possessor raising construction with verbs, see
Section 6.2.3.2), this claim does not seem entirely warranted. The (a)
construction seems reserved for kin terms only.
The (a) construction, i.e., the noun phrase structure, is restricted to
possessor-possessed phrases and true adjective plus noun constructions.
Phrases composed of kpa 'big', yua 'good', and ma 'other' have the same
restrictions as possessors lacking agreement.

other betelnut V SG
'Another betelnut'
rna
b.*patn

c.*ma kpa patn

suffixes for the modified nouns, all these restrictions disappear.

Unlike possessive-possessed phrases, there is no semantic restriction for
true adjectives concerning the type of noun which can occur in either
the tightly knit noun phrase or the scrambled pattern. Common nouns
like patn 'betelnut' occur freely in both structures. Adjectival verbs
which require in all contexts the adjectival agreement suffixes are only
encountered in the scrambled pattern. The tightly knit noun phrase
structure is ungrammatical for them.

The two stems, mama 'bad' and waca 'small', which are simultaneously
members of the class of true adjectives and adjectival verbs, are espe­
('ially interesting. When they have the morphological properties of true
adjectives, they only occur in the tight noun phrase structure; with
t.he morphological properties of adjectival verbs, they are found in the
scrambled patterns.

In (4-71) and (4-72), mama 'bad' is suffixed with -k IRR plus an agree­
ment affix, demonstrating its membership in the class of adjectival verbs.
As such, it can occur in any position and be freely separated from the
noun it modifies by other words.
We may summarize the behavior of these two constructions in the fol­
lowing table (where AGR indicates any adjectival/possessive agreement
suffix):
Noun modifier constructions
Tight noun phrase
Possessor na NScrambled patternN + Possessor na-AGR
Adjective+ N
N+Adj/Adj verb-AGR
The constructions in the first column are clear examples of noun
phrases and should be generated explicitly by phrase structure rules.
An important generalization about noun phrases in Yimas is that they
may consist of only two constituents, a modifier and a head, in that
order. If more than two modifiers are present for a given noun, one
must take an agreement suffix and occur in the scrambled pattern.

morphological, not syntactic rules.

What accounts for the difference between possessors and adjectives for

heads also applies to heads consisting of conjoined nouns, as conjoining
is done by syntactic means.

A noun phrase with a head noun composed of conjoined nouns, as in
( 4-75a), is ungrammatical. One uses either a conjoined construction of
two noun phrases, each consisting of an adjective plus a head noun, as
in ( 4-75b ), or a scrambled structure in which the adjective occurs with
an agreement suffix and has no restrictions as to its position, as in ( 475c,d). Note that the gender resolution in (4-75d,e) is to the masculine
dass I with the agreement suffix - mampan I DL. Using the corresponding
fmnale suffix - nput II DL, as in (4-75e) results in ungrammaticality. ThisNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES186illustrates the general gender/class resolution rule always neutralizes to
the unmarked class, class I for animates and class V for inanimates.
Clearly, the phrase structure rules needed to generate Yimas noun
phrases must produce structures of no more than two constituents, the
rightmost of which must be a noun, not another noun phrase, in order
to block structures like (4-75a). In other words, unlike English noun
phrases, those ofYimas are non-recursive, and the phrase structure rules
must reflect this. The following is suggested:
(4-76) NP
(M) + N
ADJ }
M
{ POSSR
N, of course, covers simple nouns like patn 'betelnut' as well as noun
compounds like numn karm 'native language'. ADJ covers all mem­
bers of the class of true adjectives, i.e., those which may occur without
agreement suffixes. POSSR consists of a noun or pronoun plus na POSS.
There is a selectional restriction concerning noun phrases with POSSR
to the effect that they are highly preferred when N is a noun, and disfa­
vored (but grammatical) elsewhere. The constituent preceding na POSS
in the POSSR slot is either a noun or a pronoun. As these are nominals,
it could be the case that a noun phrase precedes na and this would be
potential source for recursion. This possibility is more theoretical than
actual, however, for the language has general ways to avoid such possi­
bilities. For example, if we wanted to say 'my mother's brother's child'
with recursive in the POSSR constituent, one might expect the following:
(4-77) ?ama-na uayuk
na matn
na
lSG-POSS mother II SG POSS brother I SG POSS
kalakn
child I SG
'my mother's brother's child'
This is a possible structure but would, in fact, very rarely if ever be
uttered. There is a perfectly good kin term for 'mother's brother's child',
akay, just like 'cousin' in English, which would be used instead.
( 4-78) ama-na akay
lSG-POSS mother's brother's child
'my mother's brother's child'
Since the overwhelming use of possessives in noun phrases is with kin
terms, this effectively almost excludes recursion in the POSSR slot. But
even in cases with non-kin terms recursion may be avoided. Consider,
for example, the following phrase:
-->--tNOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES187na kay
(4-79) ama-na matn
lSG-POSS brother-! SG POSS canoe VIII SG
'my brother's canoe'
This contains a recursive POSSR slot and is grammatical. But an al­
ternative, and preferred, way to express ( 4-79) is to treat the complex
POSSR constituent as a single noun phrase and attach the possessive
agreement suffix for kay 'canoe' to it, thus generating a scrambled struc­
ture overall.
( 4-80) kay
na-y
[ama-na matn]
canoe VIII SG lSG-POSS brother I SG POSS-VIII SG

It is important to note that noun phrases generated by the rules in
( 4-76) typically inflect as if they were single nouns. We have already
seen that noun class and number are obligatory inflections for nouns;
they cannot be carried solely by adjoining modifiers.

payum
NR DIST-1 PL man I PL
'those men'
b. m-um
*panmal
NR DIST-1 PL man
The (b) examples are ungrammatical because the nouns appear in their
base forms (equivalent to the singular), but are modified by non-singular
pronouns. This is impossible. Nouns which are non-singular must be
inflected as such, e.g., in the (a) examples, number and noun class in­
flection may not be carried by adjoining modifiers. As the (a) examples
further demonstrate, the modifiers themselves must be inflected for the
same features of noun class and number.
But this is not the case with modifiers in noun phrases. In these
constructions, the adjective or possessor remains completely uninflected
for noun class and number (if they are so inflected the scrambled pattern
n�sults), and the head noun is the sole carrier of these features. In other
words, the noun phrase is assigned the features of noun class and number
a whole.

The claim that grammatical features are assigned to the noun phrase
as a whole is further borne out by the behavior of the oblique suffix. It
follows the head noun, but has scope over the whole noun phrase.
(4-84) a. [rna ka]-Jlan
other canoe VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe'
b.*ma-nan ka-Jlan
other-OBL canoe VIII SG-OBL
(4-84b) shows that the modifier in a noun phrase cannot be affixed with
the oblique suffix even if its head noun already is indicating that the
domain of the oblique suffix is the whole noun phrase not just the head
noun.
The modifiers which freely form noun phrases are possessors and
true adjectives, but there are sporadic instances of other word types
occurring in noun phrases without their normal adjectival/possessive
agreement suffixes. An interesting example is the following:
(4-85) [[mpa ant]-Jlan
namat]
aypak
one ground VIII SG-OBL person I PL COP I PL
'We are one clan.' ('people of one ground')
The numeral mpa 'one' almost always takes adjectival agreement suf­
fixes, but here it occurs as modifier of a noun phrase which is the first
constituent of a compound. If mpa 'one' were to take an agreement suf­
fix in the above example, it would no longer form a noun phrase with
the following noun. Because nouns and noun phrases are the only pos­
sible first constituents in this compound it would then be ill formed.
Consequently, an agreement suffix for mpa is blocked in this case.
The scrambled structures have very different properties from the
tight noun phrases. They are not single noun phrases at all, but rather
two noun phrases in apposition, one consisting of a noun, the other a
modifier, nominalized by the agreement suffix. They are joined together
as a single semantic unit (but two syntactic units) by the agreement
suffix, for it is this marker on the modifier which links it to the noun
being qualified. In no sense, though, is this noun the head of the modi­
fier; they are only joined at the level of semantic interpretation to formNOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES189a conceptual unit. Rather, there is evidence to suggest that the actual
head of the modifier is the agreement suffix itself.

(b) corresponds to the deictic in (d). This suggests that the agreement
suffix could be analyzed as the realization of the deictic, as follows:
( 4-88) [[yua]
m-ra]
good NR DIST-VII PL\ I[[yua] -ra]
In other words, modifiers affixed with the adjectival/possessive agree­
ment suffixes are noun phrases in miniature, with the agreement suffix
functioning as the head. A noun and a modifier affixed with an agree­
uwnt tmffix are simply noun phrases in apposition to each other. There190NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESis no strong syntactic relationship between them, merely a loose parat­
actic link, established by the coreference in noun class and number. This
accounts for the completely unconstrained permutations of word order
observed between a noun and a modifier with an agreement suffix. So
the structural relationships in a sentence like ( 4-86b) are as shown below:
[[yua-]ra]
[ya-n-ampa-wat]
(4-89) [imprampat]
basket VII PL good-VII PL VII PL 0-3SG A-weave-HAB
'She weaves good baskets.'
or more literally:
'She weaves baskets, good ones. '
There is no closer syntactic relationship in ( 4-89) between imprampat
'baskets' and yua-ra 'good' than there is between imprampat and the
verb. The linking between them is done at the semantic level; they
are interpreted as denoting the same real world objects because of the
coreference in the noun class and number specifications.
Further evidence that modifiers with agreement suffixes are noun
phrases in miniature is demonstrated by their behavior with the oblique
suffix, even when there is no overt noun in the clause.
( 4-90) [[[ma]-m]-un]
na-wapal
other-IV SG-OBL 3SG S-climb
'She climbed on another (sago palm) .'
The understood noun is tnum 'sago palm', indicated only by the class
IV singular adjectival suffix - (u)m. The claim is that the stem ma-m
other-IV SG is a noun phrase and, as expected, it may be affixed with
the oblique suffix.
A more interesting example is given below:
( 4-91) [anti]
[kanta] [[[[waca-k]-i]-Jlan]
ground VIII SG but
small-IRR-VIII SG-OBL
[kapa-taw-wat]]
lDL S-sit-HAB
'But we two live on a little land.'
As mentioned in Section 3.9, Yimas conjunctions like kanta 'but' have a
strong tendency to occur in the second position of the clause, as in this
example; but here it intervenes between a noun and an adjectival verb
modifier. The adjectival verb is nominalized and functions as a noun
phrase because of the suffix - i VIII SG (triggering the palatalization rule
(2-3) for the following /n/ ) . It is clear that it modifies anti 'ground'
because of their agreement in noun class and number features. The really
interesting detail is the position of the oblique suffix. While anti 'ground'
is obviously under the scope of the oblique suffix, it is only indirectlyNOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES191linked to it, by having the same noun class and number specifications
as the noun phrase waca-k-i small-IRR-VIII SG, which is in turn affixed
by the oblique suffix. Note that the oblique suffix is here attached to
what would seem at first view to be a modifier rather than the head, but
given the claim that such modifiers are in fact noun phrases themselves,
the construction is quite straightforward.","[203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213]"
"THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS219The paucal forms for first person exhibit the typical three-way par­
ticipant marking for first and second person. But the same two-way
nominative-dative system that we saw was behind this split elsewhere
also applies here. If we form a modally inflected verb from (5-44), the
A for first plural will appear and the 0 prefix will be ungrammatical.
(5-45) a. ant-kay-wa-r- vkt
POT-lPL S-go-PERF-PC
'We few almost went.'
b. * ant-kra-wa-r-vkt
POT-lPL 0-go-PERF-PC
Because the S form neutralizes to the A form rather than the 0 form
in these modally inflected verbs, the underlying accusative schema is
clearly demonstrated for these paucal forms.
But the third person forms are quite different; they are truly and
fundamentally ergative-absolutive in their participant marking. There
is a distinct A prefix for third person paucal, vkl- and another prefix
kra- for S and 0. The paucal suffix - vkt is not used.
(5-46) a. kra-wa-t
3PC S-go-PERF
'They few went.'
b. kra-n-tay
3PC 0-3SG A-see
'He saw those few.'
c. na-vkl-cay
3SG 0-3PC A-see
'Those few saw him.'
This is a clear ergative-absolutive system and follows the pattern of the
other number categories in third person. In addition to these paucal
prefixes, Yimas also has a set of paucal deictics which are clearly related
to these. They commonly function like independent pronouns and are
restricted in reference to humans ( members of classes I and II ) . They
are formed on the same deictic stems discussed in Chapter 3.
kra-k
PROX
NR DIST
m-JJkt
FR DIST
kra-n
Typically, the PROX and FR DIST forms are composed with the verbal
prefix, kra- 3 PC S/0. The NR DIST is formed with the paucal suffix,
-ykt, which does seem transparently related to vkl- 3PC A. These may
function as pronouns as deictics generally do in Yimas.
The conjugations of verbs with paucal participants in which all are220BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYthird person follow the same principles enunciated earlier for transitive
and ditransitive verbs.
( 5-47) a. kra-mpi-tay
3PC 0-3DL A-see
'Those two saw those few.'
b. kra-!Jkl-kankantakal
3PC 0-3PC A-ask
'Those few asked those few. '
c. na-!Jkl-cay

'Those few saw him. '

'Those few gave him makau.'
e. makaw
wa-n-IJa-r-IJkan
fish sp IX SG IX SG T-3SG A-give-PERF-3PC D
'He gave those few makau.'
Because the paucal number resides directly in the verbal pronominal
prefixes, these third person forms are quite straightforward and follow
exactly the patterns outlined for transitive and ditransitive verbs: the
0 prefix always precedes the A prefix. The only new point is the ditran­
sitive example (5-47e), in which the third person paucal D suffix -vkan
is introduced.
When paucal first and second persons are present, the paucal suffix
-vkt must be used. The simplest cases are those involving a third person
participant and a first or second person participant. In these cases the
suffix -vkt PC always references the number of the first or second person
participant, whether it is A, 0, or D. Because the first or second person
prefix is the higher ranked, it must always occur closer to the verb stem.
As with other number categories, the third person A must actually be
realized in the S/0 form kra- for transitive verbs, because it occurs in
initial position.

=6.5 Yimas Clause StructuresYimas clauses present a stark contrast to the highly structured and hier­
archically ordered pattern of its verbal morphology. Yimas clauses have
very little structure and certainly none that could be called hierarchical,
analogous to the levels of Vo , V 1 , V2 , and V in the verb. Yimas is an
excellent exemplar of a non-configurational language at the clausal level
(Chomsky 1981; Hale 1983): word order is free and clausal constituents
largely correspond to the word. Let me examine these claims in more
detail.
The only obligatory constituent of a clause in Yimas is a verb. In fact,
the great majority of clauses consist of just a verb. If other constituents
are present, they are arranged loosely around the verb, in no obligatory
order, although locationals and temporals tend to be located at the
clause periphery. Thus, in addition to examples like (6-184a,b) with
verb-final word order, the language also possesses the fully acceptable
variants in (6-184c,d).
(6-184) a. marmp-n
kay
river VII SG-OBL canoe VIII SG
i-ka-ak-mpi-wul
VIII SG 0-1SG A-push-SEQ-put down
b. kay

river VII SG-OBL VIII SG 0-1SG A-push-SEQ-put down
kay

'I pushed the canoe into the water.'
A clause with both norninals following the verb (i.e., a verb-initial struc-370THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREture ) is perfectly grammatical, but is a bit more marked pragmatically
than the above examples.
( 6-185 ) i-ka-ak-mpi-wul
kay
VIII SG 0-lSG A-push-SEQ-put down canoe VIII SGmarmp-n
river VII SG-OBL
'I pushed the canoe into the river.'
Examples ( 6-184a,b ) correspond to what may be called the unmarked
word order, i.e., with the verb last. A verb is associated in Yimas with a
falling intonation contour at its end, which in ( 6-184a,b) also functions
to mark the end of the clauses. This falling verbal intonation contour
also occurs in ( 6-184c,d) , but in these cases, another separate falling in­
tonation pattern occurs on the final constituents. This falling intonation
pattern is no more prominent on core arguments ( 6-184c ) than oblique
constituents ( 6-184d) . It may be that these final nominal constituents
correspond to a kind of afterthought phenomenon, as indicated by the
separate intonation contour, but these must not be equated with af­
terthought constructions in English. Yimas clauses like ( 6-184c,d) have
none of the marked pragmatic force of afterthought constructions in
English: postverbal constituents in Yimas are slightly more contrastive
than preverbal ones and thus ( 6-184c,d) are somewhat more marked
than ( 6-184a,b) , but this difference is nowhere near as emphatic as that
between John went to Berlin last weekend and He went to Berlin last
weekend, John did. It is also important to note that in examples like
( 6-184a,b ) , the core argument kay 'canoe' is already rather contrastive
in that it is encoded both as an independent noun and as a pronominal
i- VIII SG 0. The most neutral version of ( 6-184a) with no contrastive
reading at all on kay 'canoe' would lack the independent noun alto­
gether ( see Section 5.1.5 ) . It should be pointed out that afterthought
constructions with a core argument such as ( 6-184d) commonly code
the argument simultaneously with a pronominal affix. This suggests
that what is happening pragmatically in these cases is that the speaker
first codes the argument as an established referent with a pronominal
affix, but having done so, then decides that this coding is insufficient
either because there are multiple potential referents for that affix, or
because the referent is too far removed in the discourse, or because it
is simply not emphatic enough. He then repeats the full constituent
preverbally, producing an afterthought construction like ( 6-184d) . The
potential weakness in this argument is that afterthought constructions
with core arguments ( 6-184d ) are not more marked phonologically orYIMAS CLAUSE STRUCTURES371frequency-wise than those with oblique nominals (6-184c), for which no
verbal coding with a pronominal affix is available. This further suggests
that these afterthought constructions in Yimas are not highly marked
pragmatically, but represent weakly contrastive variants from the un­
marked versions.
The same comments apply to examples with more than one overt
core argument, as shown below:
(6-186) a. panmal kay
i-n-yamal
man I SG canoe VIII SG VIII SG 0-3SG A-carve
b. kay
panmal i-n-yamal
canoe VIII SG man I SG VIII SG 0-lSG A-carve
kay
c. panmal i-n-yamal
man I SG VIII SG 0-3SG A-carve canoe VIII SG
d. kay

panmal
canoe VIII SG VIII SG 0-3SG A-carve man I SG
e. i-n-yamal
panmal kay
VIII SG 0-3SG A-carve man I SG canoe VIII SG
'The man made a canoe.'
If one asks a Yimas speaker to translate 'the man made a canoe', one
is most likely to get (6-186a) as the equivalent (with (6-186b) a close
second). In this sense one could claim the word order of (6-186a), i.e.,
actor-object verb ( S OV), as the unmarked word order of Yimas. How­
ever, this claim is actually a chimera of elicitation, for in actual Yimas
discourse, examples like (6-186a) are quite rare. This is due largely to
the fact that clauses with two overt nominals functioning as core ar­
guments are very uncommon in Yimas, a highly marked structure; but
even when this does occur, it is by no means the case that a structure
like ( 6-186a) is statistically more frequent than ( 6-186b), or, for that
matter, (6-186c) or (6-186d). In this sense, the notion of unmarked
word order in Yimas corresponds more to an idealization of the linguist
than anything actually in the grammatical patterns of the speakers of
the language. Thus, both (6-186a) and (6-186b) can fairly be taken as
being roughly equivalent as to unmarked realizations of 'the man made
a canoe', with the proviso that both structures are in actuality highly
marked for having two overt nouns as core arguments.
Given the fact that the base structures (6-186a,b) are already quite
marked, it should come as no surprise that the afterthought construc­
tions (6-186c,d) are not much more so. In fact, constructions like
(6-184d), in which the noun functioning as the A participant of a transi­
tive occurs as an afterthought constituent, are probably the most com-372THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREmon of all afterthought constructions, and statistically would be more
common in Yimas texts than constructions like ( 6-186a,b). Sentences
like (6-186d) occur commonly in texts when the actions jump back and
forth sequentially between two or more central A participants. Often
when the A participant changes, the speaker first encodes the new A
with an overt deictic or just a pronominal affix or both, but he then
decides that this marking was insufficient and thus additionally express
it as an afterthought noun. Example (6-186e), like (6-184) earlier, is the
most marked of these alternatives, because it is difficult to imagine a
context in which it would be appropriate, given the pragmatic force of
contrastiveness associated with afterthought nominals.
Yimas clauses are normally just a string of words. (Phrasal con­
stituents are relatively rare in Yimas and will be discussed below.) Other
than the verb, the words usually belong to the class of nominals and there
may be more of them than allowed by the valence of the verb, as in this
example:
(6-187) a!Jkayapan patn
ama-na-kn
mama-k-n
afternoon betelnut V SG 1SG-POSS-V SG bad-IRR-V SG
kalakn na-n-kpuc-t
nam-n
boy I SG V SG 0-3SG A-chew-PERF house-OBL
'In the afternoon, the boy chewed my rotten betelnut in the
house.'
This verb contains a bivalent verb root kpuc- 'chew' which functions
formally as a transitive verb with two pronominal affixes, na- V SG 0
and n- 3SG A. Associated in the same clause are a temporal avkayapan
'afternoon' and five nominals, one oblique nam-n house-OBL 'in the
house' and the rest core, kalakn 'boy', patn 'betelnut', ama-na-kn 1SG­
POSS-V SG 'mine' and mama-k-n bad-IRR-V SG 'bad'. The four core
nominals must be linked to the two core argument slots of the verb for
this sentence to be grammatical (by the completeness constraint; see
Section 5.1.5).
A sentence like (6-187) is generated around the verb; all other con­
stituents are paratactically linked to it. The verb emerges from the
lexical and morphological derivational rules of the previous section fully
formed. It is a transitive verb, with two core arguments, one specified
as class V SG and the other as third person singular.
na - n -kpuc-t[sg] - [s�]-chew-[PERF]YIMAS CLAUSE STRUCTURES373The pronominal prefixes can now be linked to nominals with the same
specifications. The feature cluster
is easily matched to kalakn 'boy' which is third singular and, being ani­
mate, is the only possible noun that could be linked to the n- pronominal
prefix. The other prefix with the feature cluster[sg]has three possible nominals that may be linked to it: patn 'betelnut',
ama-na-kn 1SG-POSS-V SG 'mine', and mama-k-n bad-IRR-V SG 'bad'.
Because all of these are direct nominals, i.e., neither affixed with - n ""'
-nan OBL nor in a postpositional phrase, they must all be linked to this
one pronominal affix, or by the completeness constraint, the sentence
will be ungrammatical. This linkage is possible because all of them have
the same feature specifications as the pronominal prefix.
The nominals ama-na-kn 1SG-POSS-V SG 'mine' and mama-k-n bad­
IRR-V SG bear a similar kind of loose paratactic relationship to the
noun patn 'betelnut' (in this case, commonly termed apposition) that
patn 'betelnut' and kalakn 'child' bear to the pronominal prefixes. Fi­
nally, the oblique nominal nam-n house-OBL 'in the house', functioning
as a locational, and the temporal avkayapan 'afternoon' can be freely
added, for not being direct nominals, they need not be linked to the
verb. Such oblique and peripheral constituents modify the clause as a
whole. The structure of (6-187) can be diagrammatically represented as
shown below:

4.3 Proper NounsProper nouns correspond to names for persons and places in Yimas. All
inhabitants of Yimas village are given a traditional Yimas name at birth,
which stays with them throughout life, although they may acquire addi­
tional names as they mature. This traditional name is generally that of
legendary or mythological ancestor, usually belonging to the same clan
n170NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESas the conferee. As with many Sepik societies (Bateson 1936; Gewertz
1983), knowledge of long lists of names for totemic ancestors is a val­
ued resource for Yimas clans, so there is an enormous pool of available
names to draw on for any newborn child. As Yimas is a missionized,
Catholic village, almost all inhabitants also have a Christian name, be­
stowed by the priest at baptism. These are names of saints or other
Biblical characters. In daily social intercourse in the village, the great
majority normally go by these Christian names; the traditional names
are more commonly used in ceremonial indigenous contexts. Traditional
names are also commonly associated with contexts for Yimas vernacu­
lar, while Christian names are almost invariably employed in contexts
for Tok Pisin. For official, governmental purposes, Yimas people go by
their Christian name plus the traditional name of their father, following
the Anglo-Saxon convention in this regard. Thus, my primary language
helper, whose traditional name is Yakayapan, is found on the electoral
rolls as Stephen Mambi , his Christian name plus the traditional name
of his (adopted) father.
All significant areas in the territory of the Yimas have names which
designate them. Within the immediate area of the village, a separate
name may cover areas as small as a hundred square meters, but outside
of this area, the regions enclosed by a particular name are usually much
larger. Still, all hills, mountains, or even sub-parts of mountains, parts of
lakes, and lake shorelines, sections of the river, and canals have separate
names. Sometimes, these names are based on common nouns, coining
a proper noun from these to name the place according to some salient
physical feature. But this is rather rare. More commonly, a place takes
the name of some legendary person who died or performed an important
action there. But most commonly, the name is unanalyzable and has no
personal legendary precursor.
Proper nouns contrast with common nouns in that they are assigned
to no noun class and they never take number inflections. Proper nouns
designating the names of persons are also completely prohibited from oc­
curring with the oblique suffix. The proper nouns denoting place names
are more complicated. A few place names based on a common noun,
such as Kpa-upnk-n big-lake-OBL 'the largest of the eight major lakes
in the Yimas territory', have the oblique suffix as part of the name.
But in these cases it is semantically and syntactically empty, for it is
always present, regardless of the syntactic function of the nominal. It is
simply fossilized as a constituent in the compound which makes up the
name of the lake. Other than these fossilized cases, proper nouns denot­
ing place names generally cannot occur with the oblique suffix. When
being used locatively they appear simply in their stem form. There isNOUN COMPOUNDS171one exception: proper nouns denoting the names of villages do generally
take the oblique suffix when being used locatively. Some examples are
Tamprakmat-n Yimas-OBL 'at Yimas', Kapakampt-n Imanmeri-OBL 'at
Imanmeri', and Kaywal-pan Kaiwaria-OBL 'at Kaiwaria'. Note that the
morphological forms with these village names can be quite exceptional.
The proper name for Yimas village is Tamprakmal, so by the usual al­
lomorphic rules for - n - nan, the form chosen should be *-nan, rather
than -n.
f'V4.4 Noun CompoundsBoth nouns and verbs, the major, open word classes in Yimas, compound
freely. Verbal compounds are an extremely common and pervasive fea­
ture of Yimas (see Section 6.3.1). Noun compounds are rather less com­
mon, but still are not infrequently encountered. Noun compounds by
definition always have nouns as their heads, and it is the noun class and
number of the head noun which determines these features for the com­
pound as a whole. The other member of the compound (there are no
examples with more than two basic constituents) may be either a verb
or another noun or noun phrase (see Section 4.6).
Compounds made up of two noun roots are the most common type.
The language has a few examples of lexical compounds formed directly
by juxtaposing two stems. This is non-productive, and sometimes the
non-head stem is not an isolatable morpheme in the language, i.e., these
are examples of 'cranberry' morphemes (Nida 1949). Examples of this
kind of non-productive compounding follow:
(4-34) a. wala-kput
wind( wal )-rain V SG
'heavy storm'
b. kampat-paympan
?-eagle V SG
'small brown and white hawk'
c. Parampt-paympan
name-eagle V SG
'totemic ancestor'
d. kayan-taki
spirit-stone/spirit I SG
'spirit'
e. anti-Jlam-n
ground-house-OBL

blood?(yat)-liver V SG
'spleen'
g. irwan
pkam
white possum V SG skin of back
'hide of white possum'
The much more common and productive way of forming noun plus
noun compounds in Yimas is to suffix the first (the non-head) noun with
the oblique suffix. The oblique suffix occurs in the allomorph proper to
that noun. Examples follow:
(4-35) a. muca-n
marm
flower (sp) IX SG-OBL smell V SG
'smell of muca flower'
b. puratuuk-n
tampan
bile VI SG-OBL liver V SG
'gall bladder'
numpran
c. num-n
village-OBL pig III SG
'domesticated pig'
d. narmau-n wurm
woman-OBL flute VII SG
'female (i.e., smaller) flute'
e. kalk-n
apra
sago pudding V SG-OBL plate VII PL
'plates of sago pudding'
yaw
f. pukmp-n
guts VII SG-OBL road IX SG
'intestines'
yanu
g. yanan
tree V SG-OBL stick VI SG
'tree branch'
h. namtamparawt-jlan api-c-awt
foot IX DL-OBL
put inside-NFN-SG
'sock' (i.e., something into which the two feet are put)
The last example is interesting in that the head noun is actually a verb
which has been nominalized by - ru (realized as - c ) and -awt (see Section
7.1.1 on nominalizations of verbs) . The semantic relations between the
nouns in these compounds are part/whole (e,g), characteristic property
(a,b,c), and location or goal (c,f,h).
Generally in these compounds, the noun marked by the oblique suffixNOUN COMPOUNDS173may not be inflected for number: (4-35h) is one of the few examples that
shows that this is indeed possible, though such cases are rather rare.
Other cases are the words 'male' and 'female' from panmal 'man' and
narmav 'woman', which seem to vary freely between singular and plural
in some cases,

This difference may simply reflect the fact that (4-37a) is actually a
lexical entry, the plural form of kaywi 'girl, daughter'.
Proper nouns may also occur in noun compounds, as the non-head
noun, but as usual they occur without the oblique suffix.

As mentioned above, noun plus noun compounds may consist of ex­
actly two major constituents (see Section 4.6) . Compounds as a whole
may be modified by other elements, in which case the resulting con­
Ht.ituency may at first seem ambiguous.

b. [[ama-na num-n]
1SG-POSS village-OBL lip/language VII SG
'my native language' (i.e., 'the language of my village')
This string could be analyzed at first as having either the constituency of
(4-39) (a) or (b); it is impossible to determine this from the meanings in
these cases, as they are identical. As soon as the head noun is switched
from karm 'lip/language' to numpran 'pig', however, it becomes possible
to determine that the constituency of (a) is correct for (4-39).
[numpran]]]
(4-40) [ama-na [[num-n]
1SG-POSS village-OBL pig III SG
'my domesticated pig' (i.e., 'my village pig')
If one wanted to express the equivalent of the constituency outlined in
(4-39b), i.e., 'the pig of my village', a compound construction would not
be possible. Rather we would need a construction something like ( 4-41)
in which a finite relative clause modifying numpran 'pig' is employed:
ama-na-num-n
(4-41) numpran [num-n
pig III SG village-OBL lSG-POSS-village-OBL
m-ya-t]
NR DIST-come-PERF
'a pig which came from my village'
Further evidence that the constituency diagrammed in (4-39a) and (440) is correct for nominal compounds comes from the behavior of ad­
jectival modifiers. These always modify the compound as a whole and
have the number/class features of the second (i.e., head) noun. They
are prohibited from ever agreeing with these features for the first noun.
(4-42) a. [kpa-n

numpran]]
big-III SG village-OBL pig III SG
'my big domesticated pig'
b.*[kpa-nm
num-n]
numpran]
big-village SG village-OBL pig IV SG
The impossibility of (4-42b) clearly demonstrates that the actual con­
stituency for nominal compounds is that of (4-42a).
These noun plus noun compounds bear a superficial similarity to
noun plus postposition constructions. Compare these noun plus postpo­
sition constructions with the noun compounds in (4-35):
(4-43) a. nam-n
wampll{)n
house-OBL inside
'inside of the house'NOUN COMPOUNDS175b. yan-an
akpJlan
tree V SG-OBL behind
'behind the tree'
As with noun compounds, the first noun bears the oblique suffix. But
this similarity is more apparent than real, for the constituency of these
noun plus postposition constructions is quite different. When a modifier
is added, it modifies only the noun, not the whole construction, which
argues for the constituency in (4-44):
(4-44) [[[kaw!Jkra-k-n yan]-an]
akpJlan]
long-IRR-V SG tree V SG-OBL behind
'behind the tall tree'
In this example, the whole noun phrase kawvkra-k-n yan-an is embedded
under the postposition. Also, the noun and the postposition can be
separated by modifiers, something not possible within noun compounds:
( 4-45) [[[yan
kaw!Jkra-k-n]-an]
akpJlan]
tree V SG long-IRR-V SG-OBL behind
'behind the tall tree'
Noun compounds are also formed with a verb root functioning as
the non-head constituent. The verb roots occur in the same pre-head
position, but are suffixed with the nonfinite suffix -ru (for the rules for
the allomorphic variation of this suffix, see Section 7.1.1).
( 4-46) a. araka(l)-t mura!J

'a basket used for carrying pounded sago pith to the washing
place'
c. ayk-t

marry-NOM road IX SG
'rule for a proper marriage'
Verbs occurring in these noun compounds obligatorily lack tense suffixes
and the cross-referencing affixes for core arguments. However, a noun
functioning as the object of the verb in the compound can appear overtly.
(1-47) [[tamana tu-t]
[kalk]]

I n these cases the complex consisting of the noun object plus verb func­
tions as the first constituent of the noun compound.
It is also possible for a verb plus noun compound to occur as the first176NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESconstituent of a noun plus noun compound. These structures fit well into
the overall structure of Yimas complex nominals, for the language has a
structural principle requiring heads on the right. When verb plus noun
compounds occur as non-head members of noun plus noun compounds,
this target is met serially; the two noun heads are adjacent to each other
to the right of the verb as follows:
[[verb - ru noun] noun]
Examples of such compounds follow:

4 . 5 PossessionAs in many languages, possession in Yimas is best characterized as an
oblique relation, i.e., the semantic relation between possessor and pos­
sessed is paraphrasable by English prepositions like 'with', 'to', or 'at'.
This is most transparently indicated in Yimas when possession is ex­
pressed clausally, in examples like 'I/you/etc. have a chair'. In these
cases the possessor functions as the subject of the clause whose predi­
cate is the copula, and the thing possessed appears as the object of a
postpositional construction with kantk- 'with, along with' ( tak- is an
alternative when the possessed noun is a body part). The postposition
kantk- occurs with an agreement suffix of the adjectival suffix set, indi­
cating the number and class of the possessor. Consider these examples:
kantk-n amayak
( 4-49) a. ama tkt
lSG chair V SG with-1 SG COP lSG
'I have a chair.'
b. impa-n
arm kantk-nprum aympak
3DL-FR DIST water with-11 PL COP 3DL
'Those two (females) have kerosene.'
c. ipwa tawra kantk-um aypwak
2PL money with-1 PL COP 2PL
'You have money.'
These uses of kantk- 'with' to express possession are no different from
its other uses, such as comitative.
Nouns marked by kantk- and hence functioning as oblique nominals
may under certain semantic conditions (see Section 6.2.3.3.1) becomePOSSESSION177core nominals by increasing the valency of the verb with tav- COM, i.e.,
kantk- peripheral nominals correspond to tav- core nominals. Compare
( 4-49a) above with ( 4-50):
( 4-50) arm ma-na-tau-taw-n
water 2SG S-DEF-COM-sit-PRES
'Do you have kerosene?'
This use of kantk 'with' to indicate possession is obviously closely
related to its use with the adjectival nouns (see Section 3.3). Since
these function syntactically as nouns, the relationship to the nouns they
modify is close to one of possession, and so it is no surprise that the
same construction is available, among others (see Section 3.3).
(4-51) a. ama tamana
kantk-n amayak
lSG sickness IX SG with-I SG COP lSG
'I am sick.'
b. ipa wapun
kantk-um aypak
lPL happiness V SG with-I PL COP lPL
'We are happy.'
These examples with adjectival nouns contrast with examples involving
true possessives, in that when the adjectival noun becomes a core ar­
gument it does so directly; tav- COM is completely unacceptable in the
same meaning.
( 4-52) a. wapun
ama-na-pay-n
happiness V SG lSG S-DEF-carry-PRES
'I'm feeling happy.'
b.*wapun
ama-na-tau-pay-n
happiness V SG lSG S-DEF-COM-carry-PRES
(Example (4-52b) is acceptable in the meaning 'My clan is happy' where
tav- COM marks the members of one's clan, literally 'I (with my clan)
am happy'. This is a true comitative usage). Further, when adjectival
nouns become core arguments, they often function as subjects of their
dauses. This is impossible for truly possessed items.

the copula, it can also be indicated nominally, often as part of a noun
phrase. If a noun phrase is formed of the possessor plus possessed, the
possessor precedes the possessed item and is followed with the possessive
marker na.

POSS canoe VIII SG-OBL lSG S-go-IRR
'I will go in Yakayapan's canoe.'
The possessive marker na normally is a particle rather than a bound
affix. It takes stress, although not full primary stress. Rather like
English 's POSS, it can follow and have scope over whole phrases or
clauses.

The embedded structure is a finite relative clause (see Section 7.2.1).
Possessive constructions consisting of possessor plus na plus pos­
sessed form tightly knit noun phrases. The word order is rigid: no
permutations are possible and nothing may be inserted between the two
constituents. The head of the construction is the possessed noun, as
demonstrated by the fact that it is this noun which is cross-referenced
on the verb (see example (4-54a)). In all these features, possessor plus
possessed noun phrases are exactly like noun plus noun compounds, and
the close similarity between the possessive suffix na and the oblique
suffix - n ""' - nan would seem not to be coincidental. We have already
documented above the claim that the relation of possession in Yimas is
an oblique one, like the relationship between the nouns marked by the
oblique suffix. It appears then that the fundamental relationships be­
tween the nouns in a nominal compound and a possessive noun phrase
are very closely related, if not identical. Further evidence for this view
is provided by examples like the following:POSSESSION179( 4-56) a. tu:ukntuma na-kn
marm
possum III SG POSS-V SG smell V SG
'smell of a possum'
b. mlmp-n
marm
feces VII SG-OBL smell V SG
'smell of feces'
(4-56a) is a possessor-possessed construction while (4-56b) is a noun
plus noun compound. The head noun marm 'smell' is identical in both
cases, and it could hardly be claimed that the basic relationship between
the nouns is very different in the two examples. However, there is a
subtle semantic difference between these two, which is responsible for
the difference in construction. The smell of a possum may be important
in a particular discourse, but is not normally taken as a permanent,
pervading characteristic of the animal, while the smell of feces is. The
difference between transitory qualities and characteristic properties is an
important semantic contrast throughout Yimas grammar and realized in
number of different ways and constructions, as we shall see in Chapters
6 and 7. It is this contrast which is being realized here in the choice
between a possessive noun phrase construction or a noun compound.
Another factor probably relevant here is that na POSS is restricted to
the animate nouns, the only possible true possessors.
Common and proper nouns functioning as possessors are simply suf­
fixed with na POSS. First and second person possessors use the indepen­
dent pronoun forms (see Section 3. 7), while the forms for third person
are closely related to the verbal prefixes for third person (see Section
aG . l .2.1).","[190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"
"374THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREAs mentioned above, clausal constituents are generally words. The
only phrasal constituents that exist at the clause level are noun phrases
and postpositional phrases. As discussed in Section 4.6, Yimas has a very
restricted category of noun phrase, consisting of no more than two words
and generated by the following rules, repeated below for convenience
(where N true nouns, independent pronouns and deictics, as well as
nominalized adjectives and verbs).
(M) + N

1SG-POSS betelnut V SG
'my betelnut'
b. rna pucmp-n

Postpositional phrases parallel noun phrases in that the head always
occurs to the right; in this case, it is the postposition. Unlike noun
phrases which are highly restrictive in only allowing a single modifier to
occur before the head noun, postpositional phrases allow a number of
prehead modifiers, which correspond to nominals.

'with'As already discussed, at the actual clause level there are no hierarchi­
cal structure or ordering constraints among the constituents. Adapting
the convention of Gazdar et al. (1985) of using a comma for constituents
freely ordered, we can write the following rule for generating Yimas
clauses:
(6-195) S (NP) n , (PP) n , (X) n , V
where X indicates words belonging to minor word classes, such as tem­
porals and locationals.
Applying this rule and those in (6-189) and (6-194) to example
(6-196) we generate the phrase structure (6-197).

When we come to transitive and ditransitive verbs with both a first
and second person participant, the use of the paucal suffix becomes more
complex, because it is now potentially (albeit, in practice, almost never)
ambiguous as to what participant it is linked to. To grasp clearly the
basic system let me first present examples which are not potentially am­
biguous, involving a paucal and a dual or singular participant. Following
the pattern of exposition established for transitive and ditransitive verbs
above, ·let us begin with the case of a second person A and a first person
0. Consider the case in which the second person A is paucal:222BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY(5-50) a. pa-J]a-tput-c-J]kt
2PC-1SG 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit me.'
b. pa-J]kra-tput-c-J]kt
2PC-1DL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit us two.'
Because the first person 0 is the higher ranked prefix, it occurs in the
inner position. The second person paucal A is realized by the prefix pav­
(appearing as pa- before an /JJ/), presumably a contraction from the S
form, pavkra-. Although unnecessary because the prefix pav- uniquely
marks paucals, the suffix - vkt is also used. This second person prefix
pav- only occurs in combination with first person participants, never
third person.
Now consider the opposite case, with a singular or dual second person
A and a paucal first person 0 .
(5-51) a . ma-kra-tpul-c-J]kt
2SG A-lPL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You hit us few.'
b. kapwa-kra-tupul-c-J]kt
2DL A-lPL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You two hit us few. '
Here the suffix -vkt is necessary t o distinguish these forms from the
corresponding verbs with plural 0, for there is no unique first person
paucal prefix parallel to pav-. As with transitive verbs generally, the S
forms are used to mark the second person A in both examples (compare
(5-27)) .
Switching the assignment of participant roles to a first person A and
a second person 0 and considering the case of a paucal second person
first, I present the following:
(5-52) a. paJ]-kul-cpul-c-J]kt
2PC-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'I hit you few. '
b . kapa paJ]-kul-cpul-c-J]kt
lDL 2PC-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'We two hit you few.'
Again, the prefix pav- 2PC is found, but this time in combination with
kul- 2PL 0 and -vkt PC, although -vkt PC seems to be somewhat optional
in these examples. Note that, as we saw with transitive verbs earlier (see
(5-29)), the first person A may not occur as a bound affix in these forms,THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS223but only as an independent pronoun; absence of a pronoun (5-52a) is
again interpreted to mean first singular.
Finally, there is the case of a paucal first person A and a singular
or dual second person 0. If the 0 is second singular the ubiquitous
kampan- ""' mpan- appears.

b . pa!Jkt !Jkul-cpul

As usual, the number of the first person A must be indicated by an
independent pronoun, in this case, pavkt lPC, and only one pronominal
prefix is permitted, referencing the person and number of the 0. Note
that the paucal suffix is not present in (5-53b); in fact, its occurrence
will result in an ungrammatical construction.
(5-54) * pa!Jkt
1Jkul-cpul-c-1Jkt
lPC 2DL-hit-PERF-PC
The explanation for this is related to a claim made in Section 5.1.2.
There I asserted that non-singular second person A's are bound to their
verbs as the S prefix forms, while first person A's are not, but are simply
the independent pronouns. This is in spite of the fact that in both
cases the S prefix forms and the independent pronouns are completely
homophonous. Their differential behavior with respect to the paucal
suffix is a strong argument for this analysis, for a second person paucal
A occurs with it.
(5-55) a. pa-IJa-tpul-c-IJkt
2PC-1SG 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit me.'
b. pa-!Jkra-tpul-c-JJkt

Uut a first person paucal A does not:

lPC 2DL 0-hit-PC
'We few hit you two.'
b. pa!Jkt kul-cpul- * ( !Jkt)
lPC 2PL 0-hit-PC
'We few hit you all.'
This prohibition on -vkt PC is explained by the fact that pavkt is an224BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYindependent pronoun, not a bound affix, and that -vkt must be linked
to a bound person affix in its verb. Interestingly, (5-56b) with -vkt might
be expected to be grammatical if it were linked to kul- 2PL 0. But that
is not the case; in fact, if the second person is to be paucal, the prefix
pav- must be used.
(5-57) paJ]kt paJJ-kul-cpul-c-J]kt
lPC 2PC-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'We few hit you few.'
Again, - vkt is necessarily linked to a bound affix. The final very strong
piece of evidence for this analysis is provided by examples of verbs with
kampan- ""' mpan- , expressing a first person paucal A. This allows the
paucal suffix.
(5-58) uralJ
paJ]kt k-mpan-tkam-r-J]kt
coconut VI SG lPC VI SG T-1A/2SG D-show-PERF-PC
'We few showed you a coconut. '
This example conclusively demonstrates that i t is not the person of the
A which controls the distribution of -vkt PC, but whether it is expressed
through a bound verbal affix or not. As a first person A is indicated in
the bound portmanteau morpheme kampan- ""' mpan- 1A/2SG O,D, the
paucal suffix expressing its number is permitted.
Now let me turn to a few potentially ambiguous cases, verbs inflected
with the paucal suffix and having two plural or paucal participants. This
ambiguity is largely theoretical, for these verbs in practice almost never
truly are ambiguous. Verbs in which the paucal participant is second
person are often disambiguated by the prefix pav- 2PC.
( 5-59) paJ]kt palJ-kul-cpul-c-l]kt
lPC 2PC-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'We few hit you few. '
Here pav- indicates second paucal and in combination with the prefix
kul- 2PL 0 forces the reading of the 0 as second paucal and the pronoun
pavkt as the first person paucal A. Consider the alternative participant
arrangement:
( 5-60) pal]kt kra-tpul-c-l]kt
2PC lPL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit us few.'
Here the verbal prefix is the first person 0, kra- lPL 0, indicated as
paucal by the suffix -vkt. This clearly establishes the potentially am­
biguous independent pronoun pavkt as second person. Although the A is
therefore second person paucal, the prefix pav- 2PC is in fact prohibitedTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS225in this example, for its presence would result in homophony with the
verb expressing a first person dual 0 (see (5-50b)).
As a final example consider the following set of examples with a
paucal participant and a plural participant:
(5-61) a. ipa pau-kul-cpul-c-ukt
lPL 2PC-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'We hit you few. '
b . paukt kul-cpul
lPC 2PL 0-hit
'We few hit you all.'
c. ipwa-kra-tpul-c-ukt
2PL A-lPL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You all hit us few. '
d . paukt kra-tpul
2PC lPL-hit
'You few hit lis.'
Note that the verb form in (5-61a) is exactly the same as that of (559) : only the choice of the independent pronouns pavkt lPC versus
ipa lPL disambiguates the two. (5-61b) is unambiguous because the
lack of any paucal marking on the verb identifies the prefix kul- 2PL
0 as truly plural and by elimination pavkt must be first person. (561c) is also unambiguous because ipwa- is unambiguously plural and
therefore -vkt must be associated with kra- lPL 0. Finally, (5-61d)
has no paucal suffix, so kra- lPL must be plural and the pronoun pavkt
second person. (5-61d) has a second person paucal A, and we would
perhaps have expected it to be realized on the verb by the prefix paT)-,
producing the following:
(5-62) * pau-kra-tpul-c-JJkt
2PC-1PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit us.'
This, while a possible form, is in fact impossible in this meaning. This
is because (5-62) is completely homophonous with (5-55b) which is a
grammatical form expressing a first person dual 0.
5.1.5 The Forms of the Copula
The copula is used in equational, identificational and possessive state­
ments (for its function in the last type, see Section 4.5). The copula
always expresses a relation between two noun phrases, either establish­
i ng its identity or ascribing a quality to it. Consider these two examples:BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY226(5-63) a. k-n
akr!J

'That's a tree frog.'
b. m-n
kpa-n
anak
NP DIST-I SG big-I SG COP I SG
'He's big.' (literally 'he's a big one')
The first example would be in answer to the question 'what's that?' on
hearing a noise in the woods. The second ascribes the quality of bigness
to a human referent represented by m-n 'he'. Although kpa- 'big' is an
adjective base, when the concord marker - n is added it becomes a noun,
as discussed in Section 4.6; so again, (5-63b) demonstrates that copula
always connects two noun phrases.
The copula is the only truly irregular verb in Yimas, and it is highly
so. The underlying basic stem is (a) ya- to which the S prefix forms are
attached. But these prefixes generally metathesize to become infixes,
with often highly unpredictable results, so it seems best to simply list
the variant forms of the copula.","[242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248]"
"YIMAS AS A POLYSYNTHETIC LANGUAGE279These sentences are nearly synonymous, and both are regarded as gram­
matical by native speakers. (There may be a subtle semantic difference
between them equivalent to 'He turned and came toward her' (6-2a) ver­
sus 'He turned toward her and came (toward her) ' (6-2b), but all speak­
ers queried regarded them as practically equivalent. Note that while
the two English sentences above have different structures and might be
said to have different meanings, they clearly can denote the same event.)
The formal difference between the two examples in (6-2) concerns the
placement of the allative valence increasing prefix ira- 'toward, because
of' (see Section 6.2.3.3.3). It is this prefix which sanctions the 0 prefix
na- 3SG 0 for this complex which only contains two intransitive verbs,
way- 'turn' and ya- 'come'. Note that regardless of whether ira- ALL
is placed immediately before ya- (6-3a) or precedes both verb roots (63b), it still licenses the appearance of na- 3SG 0 at the beginning of the
whole verb, demonstrating its integrity as a single grammatical word.
A final argument in favor of the analysis of the complex expressions
in ( 6-1 ) as single words concerns the behavior of modifying forms such as
those for aspect, modality, and mood. Note that the aspectual marker
nanav- DUR modifies both verbs in (6-1b) , as does the negative prefix
in (6-1c). This latter does not mean * 'again those few did not see her,
but they again came back'. This principle also applies to the scope of
mampi 'again' in this example: it modifies both verbs. In the text from
which (6-1c) is drawn, the expression describes the second time in which
someone who has fallen out of a canoe is ignored and the people paddled
on. Thus, the intended interpretation: ""Again those few did not see her
and again those few did not come back (for her).""
These arguments establish fairly conclusively that the constructions
in ( 6-1) are best analyzed as single words. Thus, Yimas is a polysynthetic
language. There is a very strong tendency throughout Yimas grammar
to reduce complex expressions to single words, as befits its polysynthetic
status. In the above examples, clauses and even complex sentences are
realized as single words. This tendency also finds articulation in the
system of nominals, discussed in Sections 4.4 and 4.6. As pointed out,
Yimas productively forms compounds with two nouns, the head noun
to the right and the other suffixed with the oblique suffix - n ""' - nan.

These nominal compounds are further examples of this polysynthetic
tendency to reduce complex expressions to single words. That these
form single words is indicated by the fact that they may serve as the
head of possessive constructions,
(6-4) [ama-na

'my domesticated pig'
while true noun phrases may not.

1SG-POSS big pig III SG
These same constraints apply to the tightly knit noun phrases con­
sisting of a modifier plus a noun discussed in Section 4.6. In many ways
these too behave as single words. For example, the oblique suffix may
occur only once, on the head noun,
(6-6) a. [rna
kay]-Jlan
other canoe VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe'
*
b. ma-nan
kay-Jlan

while in the loose, scrambling type of nominal constituents, it may occur
on both modifier and noun.
(6-7) kay-Jlan
ma-y-Jlan
canoe VIII SG-OBL other- VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe.'
The moral of this discussion of Yimas as a polysynthetic language is
that Yimas is one language in which the distinction between the gram­
matical levels of word and phrase is hazy at best and perhaps non­
existent. (In the next chapter we shall see that a similar haziness applies
to the border between clause and sentence.) Basically, it is the genius of
Yimas to employ many grammatical devices in a conspiracy to reduce
phrase-level units to word-level ones. This is closely related to the fact
that Yimas is syntactically a very flat language (see Hale 1983; Blake
1983): that is, the basic relations in Yimas syntactic constructions are
syntagmatic, forms following forms in linear sequence, rather than in aSTEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES281hierarchical arrangement. We shall see many examples of this property
in the next two chapters. One of the results of this resistance to hierar­
chy is that phrase-level structures are formally rather like words. Thus,
instead of [black[dog]), in which the hierarchical structure is indicated by
the level of bracketing, the Yimas equivalent is rather more like [black­
dog] , in which the components are syntagmatically related on the same
level.
Returning now to the examples in (6-1), it will be noted that I have
marked off a sequence of morphemes in each example by enclosing them
within brackets. This simply sets off the verbal morphology discussed
in the previous chapter from the rest of the verb whose structure will
be discussed in this chapter. A verb is made up of the basic verbal
morphology already presented, which corresponds to the verb periphery
and what I will term the verb theme. Verb themes may themselves be
complex, composed at least of one verb stem plus a set of optional verbal
affixes and incorporated adverbials. For example, in (6-la) the verb
theme is composed of the verb stem takat- 'touch' plus the prefixes pay­
'first' and ma- 'in'. The verb theme of (6-lc) is composed of two verb
stems taympi- 'see' and waraca- 'return' plus the incorporated adverbial
mampi- 'again' . A verb stem is in turn composed of no more than one
verb root plus optional derivational affixes. In (6- le), the verb stem is
composed of the verb root kulanav 'walk' and the derivational affixes
tav- COM and tal- CAUS.
The last chapter dealt with the basic verbal morphology of pronomi­
nal affixes: tense, aspect, modality, and mood. These categories form the
basis of the verb periphery and correspond to the morphemes which oc­
cur outside the verb theme, those morphological categories which apply
to it as a whole. In this chapter ,I will be concerned with the morphol­
ogy internal to the verb theme, that complex verbal morphology which
is particularly indicative of Yimas as a polysynthetic language. Because
this morphology is so complex, it is necessary to proceed from the basic
units and build up the morphological structure of the theme, brick by
brick. Thus, we start with the structure of the verb stem and its con­
struction from a verb root and, more specifically, with the question of
the transitivity of Yimas verbs.
6.2 Stem Derivational Processes
6.2.1 The Concept of Transitivity
Yimas is a language in which it is very important to make a clear dis­
tinction between the syntactic-semantic notion of the valence of a verb
and the formal morphological idea of transitivity. Very often there is a
mismatch between these two concepts, much more so than in more fa-282THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREmiliar languages like English. In Yimas, transitivity is defined formally,
by the number of overt pronominal affixes present: an intransitive verb
has no more than one pronominal affix, a transitive verb has two, and
a ditransitive verb has three. Valence, on the other hand, is a lexical
feature of verbs, either basic verb roots or derived verb stems and verb
themes. Verbs with one associated core argument are monovalent, those
with two are bivalent and those with three are trivalent. Yimas neither
allows verbs with more than three pronominal prefixes nor possesses
verbs, either basic or derived, with more than three core arguments.
In English and many other languages, there is generally a straight­
forward correspondence between transitivity and valence: monovalent
verbs are intransitive, bivalent verbs are transitive, and trivalent verbs
are ditransitive. This is not always transparently so in Yimas. First of
all, as pointed out in Section 5.1.6, overt pronominal affixes are not oblig­
atory, but are linked to pragmatic functions like givenness, etc. Hence
it is not unusual for a trivalent verb like va- 'give' to appear as an in­
transitive or simple transitive verb, with only one or two pronominal
prefixes.
(6-8) m-n
patn
ka-ua-ua-n
NR DIST-1 SG betelnut V SG LIKE-lSG D-give-PRES
'He will give me betelnut.'
Or a bivalent verb like wampaki 'throw' can be used intransitively with
only a single pronominal affix.
(6-9) nmpi
ay-cra-wampak-Jla-ukt
leaf VII PL HORT PL-around-throw-IMP-PC
'Let us few distribute letters.'
Examples like these were discussed earlier in Section 5.1.6, and it was
claimed there that they present cases of zero pronominal affixes. With
this analysis, the valence and transitivity of these verbs are in a one­
to-one correspondence; this is simply disguised by the zero pronominal
prefixes. By virtue of the completeness constraint, zero pronominal pre­
fixes are, of course, directly linked to core nominal arguments such as
patn 'betelnut' or nmpi 'leaves', so that all argument slots of these verbs
are in fact filled.
More problematic are common cases like those below, in which a
verb is marked with more pronominal prefixes than are called for by its
valence.
(6-10) a. ta-mp-ant-kia-k-nak-mpwi
NEG-3 DL A-hear-NIGHT-IRR-3 SG D-talk T
'Those two did not listen to her.'","[300, 301, 302, 303, 304]"
"204BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYHere al 'machete' functions as the instrument responsible for the cutting.
There is no responsible agent mentioned in the sentence, so it is the
instrument which is coded by the A prefix. Note that although the 0
is animate and the A inanimate, the A still occurs closer to the verb
stem, in the higher ranking position. Now consider the following two
examples:
kay
(5-23) a. arm i-mpu-tal-c1Jknt-t
water VIII SG 0-3PL A-CAUS-heavy-PERF canoe VIII SG
'The water made the canoe heavy. '
b. ikn
antki
smoke V SG thatch VII PL
ya-n-tar-urkpwica-t
VII PL 0-3SG A-CADS-blacken-PERF
'The smoke blackened the roof (thatch) .'
It is worth pointing out that arm 'water', which constitutes a noun
class by itself and is normally referenced by an S/0 verbal prefix ima-,
is treated as a plural noun when an A argument and indicated by the
third plural A prefix mpu-. In both examples, the verbs are overtly
causative, as expressed by the causative prefix tar- ""' tal- (see Section
6.2.3.1.3), and the inanimate nouns which express the forces functioning
as the causes are referenced by the corresponding A prefix. While con­
structions like those of (5-23) are certainly grammatical in Yimas, such
constructions with an overtly causativized verb have an alternative in
which the verb is intransitive and associated with an S argument express­
ing the entity undergoing the change of state and an oblique noun for the
causing force. So compare the examples in (5-23) to the corresponding
intransitive examples in (5-24) :
(5-24) a. arm-n
kay
i-cJJknt-t
water-OBL canoe VIII SG VIII SG S-heavy-PERF
'The canoe got heavy from the water.'
b. ikn-an
antki
ya-urkpwica-t
smoke-OBL thatch VII PL VII PL S-blacken-PERF
'The roof (sago thatch) blackened from the smoke.'
These later constructions obviate the need to code the inanimate causers
with an A prefix, instead marking them as peripheral nouns with the
oblique suffix. The constructions of both (5-23) and (5-24) are equally
grammatical and there is no significant meaning difference between
them, although perhaps the examples (5-23) , in which the causing func­
tions are marked as A, reflect a more direct causation, focusing on theTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS205causer, rather than the change of state. This seems to be true of the
corresponding English translations.
Having now discussed in some detail verbs associated with two third
person participants, let me turn to the next most straightforward cases,
those with one third person participant and one first or second person
participant. According to principle one, the first or second person par­
ticipant outranks the third person, so it must occupy the position closer
to the verb stem. Now the second principle must be considered: A out­
ranks 0 for third person, but 0 outranks A for first and second. So if
the A is third person and the 0 is first or second, there is no conflict
between the two principles: the first or second person 0 will occupy the
ranking position closer to the verb stem, and the third person A will
precede it.
(5-25) a. pu-ua-tay
3PL A-lSG O-see
'They saw me.'
b. impa-ukul-cay

3SG A-lPL O-see
'He saw us. '
p-ua-kra-t
d . naukm
grass VII SG VII SG A- lSG 0-cut-PERF
'The grass cut me.'
Note that because of the constraints on the form of the third person
prefixes imposed by linear order, the third person A's in these examples
actually appear in the form for S and 0, the only permissible form for
initial position. Also, because the A prefix must occur initially in an
S /0 form, it is now possible to indicate the noun class of inanimate
A 's as in (5-25d). This is not possible for verbs with two third person
participants, in which the A prefix must be the A form in the ranking
H«'cond position (5-23) .
If the A is first or second person and the 0 third person, the two
principles for ranking are now in conflict with each other. In this situ­
ation, principle one provides, and the first or second person participant
occupies the higher ranked position, even though it is an A (compare
t.lwse with examples in (5-25)) :
( fJ-26) a . pu-ka-tay

3DL 0-2DL A-see
'You two saw them two.'
c. na-kay-cay
3SG 0-lPL A-see
'We saw him. '
Now let us turn to the most complex cases, verbs with a first person
participant and a second person participant. By principle one, the first
person participant, will always outrank the second. But principle two
poses a potential dilemma. Remember that for first and second persons
0 outranks A, so that if the first person participant is the 0 and the
second person the A, there is no problem: both principles select the
same participant, the first person 0, as the higher ranked. If, on the
other hand, the first person participant is the A and the second person
the 0, the two principles are in conflict: principle one selects the first
person A as the higher ranked, while principle two chooses the second
person 0. As we shall see below, Yimas has evolved a clever solution to
this dilemma.
Let us start with the simpler of the two cases, that in which the
principles are in harmony. These involve a first person 0 and a second
person A. By both principles the higher ranked will be the first person
0, and therefore the prefix for this participant will occur closer to the
verb stem:
( 5-27) a. ma-IJa-tay
2SG A-lSG O-see
'You saw me. '
b . ma-kra-tay
2SG A-lPL O-see
'You saw us.'
c. kapwa-IJkra-tay
2DL A-lDL O-see
'You two saw us two.'
d. ipwa-IJkra-tay
2PL A-lDL O-see
'You all saw us two.'
Because the second person A is the lower ranked participant, it would
have to appear in the verb-initial position. But as we have seen with
third person prefixes, there is a constraint which prohibits the A prefix
forms from appearing there. Hence, the second person A is actually real­
ized with the S prefix form, as with the third person examples discussed
earlier. For example, in ( 5-27a,b) , the second singular A is marked byTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS207the prefix ma- 2SG S. The same constraint causes the S prefixes for non­
singular second person participants to be employed in examples (5-27c,
d), although in these cases it is a little more difficult to be sure that
there are in fact bound S prefixes, for they are completely homophonous
with the independent pronouns. Evidence that there are in fact bound
prefixes will be presented below in Section 5.1.4 on paucal marking and
again in Section 5.2.2.1 on negation.
Let us now look at the case in which the two principles fixing the lin­
ear order of A and 0 prefixes are in conflict, those involving a first person
A and a second person 0. By principle one, the first person A should
be the higher ranked, but by principle two, the second person 0 should
be. For a second person singular 0, the language avoids the problem en­
tirely by having a suppletive portmanteau morpheme mpan- ""' kampan­
(whose allomorph occurs word-initially) which is used whenever a first
person A of any number acts on a second singular 0.
(5-28) a. kampan-tay
1A/2SG O-see
'I saw you.'
b. kapa kampan-tay
lDL 1A/2SG O-see
'We two saw you.'
c. ipa kampan-tay
lPL 1A/2SG O-see
'We saw you.'
To distinguish the number of the first person A, an independent pronoun
must be used, as in (5-28b, c). Without a pronoun, first singular is
assumed, unless context determines otherwise (5-28a).
If the second person 0 is non-singular, the language copes by simply
prohibiting both participants from being realized as bound prefixes to
the verb. The second person 0 occupies the ranking position of the prefix
to the verb, and the first person A must appear as an independent pro­
noun. These independent pronouns are, of course, again homophonous
with the corresponding S prefixes (as with the examples of the non­
H ingular second person A's in (5-27c, d), but in this situation the first
JH�rson A's are flatly prohibited from being bound to the verb).

Interestingly, Yimas allows non-finite nominalizations rather like
agentive nominalizations to be formed for locationals. These are identi­
cal in form to other non-finite nominalizations except that they require
the concord marker - a IX SG and the oblique suffix. These describe a
place which exists specifically for the purpose of performing the action
described by the relative clause, as in these examples:

by adding it to Tok Pisin words, new Yimas verb roots are
derived.)

These finite relative clauses without m- NR DIST quite commonly
function alone without being linked as a modifier to any other noun in428INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSthe clause. This has led in some cases to their being re-analyzed as noun
stems.
(7-107) wa-n [amp-0-ra]
yara-k
go-IMP kindle-PERF-V PL pick up-IRR
'Go collect firewood!'
The main verb in this example is in the imperative mood, yet the tense of
the nominalization is perfective. These two are contradictory, of course,
the imperative corresponding to actions yet to be done, and the perfec­
tive to those already completed. This contradiction is possible simply
because nominalizations like ampra 'firewood' or amtra 'food' are now
nouns in their own right and are no longer seen as the result of a pro­
ductive nominalization process, rather like the dead in English.
The only relative clauses without m- NR DIST which commonly do
have an overt modified 'head' noun are those functioning like English
adjectives to express qualities or states. As pointed out in Sections 3.3
and 6.2.3.1.3, most Yimas roots corresponding to English adjectives are
actually verbs denoting processes, the so-called adjectival verbs. When
these translate English adjectives, i.e., denote states or qualities, they
are nothing but these m- less finite relative clauses, most commonly
found with the tense suffix -k IRR to describe an unbounded temporal
duration, although other tense suffixes are possible (7-108c).

A final point to consider here is the meaning contrast associated with
the presence versus absence of m- NR DIST in finite relative clauses. The

trate the contrast, consider (7-109a,b), diagrammed as (7-llOa,b):

Finite relative clauses with m- NR DIST are obligatorily associated with
a definite, established, modified 'head' noun as their referent, while those
without m- are not, often having a vague class of referents as possi­
ble referents (e.g., means of going (7-105d)). This is, of course, fully
in keeping with the presence versus absence of the definite near distal
stem. Further, a finite relative clause with m- often has established nom­
inal participants, reflected in the verbal pronominal affixes, while those
without m- never do. They obligatorily lack all expression of nominal
participants, either as independent words or pronominal affixes.
A common use of finite relative clauses with m- NR DIST is in cleft
constructions. These are equational sentences in which certain identify­
ing or descriptive features of a focused noun are provided by a relative
clause. The semantics of clefts thus prohibits them from occurring with
relative clauses without m- NR DIST. English examples are it was John
who shea·red the sheep and John was the one who sheared the sheep.
Yimas clefts consist of a noun ph1H a modifying relative clause plus an430INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSoptional copula. The relative clauses in both Yimas and English clefts
present information which is already known or presumed from the con­
text of the speech act. The function of a cleft construction is to use this
information to identify the proper referent of the noun of the cleft or
at least to predicate something important and relevant about it. Thus
the relative clause in both examples, who sheared sheep, provides rele­
vant information about the head noun of these cleft constructions, John.
Yimas clefts are exactly parallel.

Clefts are important in Yimas because they play a central role in
content questions, otherwise known as wh questions. Note that in ques­
tions like Who sheared the sheep? or What did he shear the sheep with?,
the action of shearing sheep is presupposed and established and what is
at issue is who did the action or what was used to perform it. Thus, the
pragmatic force of the non- wh component of these questions is identical
to that of a relative clause in a cleft, and so it is really no surprise that
some wh questions in Yimas take the forms of clefts. If the wh word
is functioning as S, then a cleft construction is obligatory; to use an
ordinary clause structure is ungrammatical.

"Sago flour is cooked in two ways, either in flat, rather dry pancakes( tpuk) or in a porridge ( kalk) made by adding sago flour to boiling water
until it gels. A Yimas meal typically consists of sago ( tpuk) and a meat
( navkpuk) , usually fish, but occasionally other animals. Meats are oftenalso supplemented with various types of edible green plants gathered by
the women; the most common type is a fern of the lake shores ( namlan) .
One of the great delicacies in Yimas cuisine are sago grubs ( wun) which
are cultivated by felling and opening a sago palm which is allowed to
decay. A large black beetle lays its eggs in the tree, and these hatch into
the sago grubs. The tree is allowed to lie for a month or so until the
grubs become large and fat. They are then collected and eaten.
Yimas divide their year into two seasons, dry and wet, or dry water
(kavm) and high water ( arm kparm) . The dry season, which is at its
height around September, is a time of plentiful food. As the lakes dry
out due to lack of rain, the fish get trapped in the shrinking pools and
float to the surface for lack of oxygen. Further, as the forest dries out,
animals come closer to the lakes for water and are easier to hunt. This is
a time of gluttonous feasting on fish and hence is a good time for rituals
requiring feasts. The wet season, which runs from November through
May and peaks around February, is exactly the opposite. This is a time
of scarcity of food, although the Yimas with their rich lands never suffer
real hardship in this regard. With the lakes at a high level and the river
in flood, fish find many hiding places from the net, trap, and spear. PigsETHNOGRAPHIC SKETCH13and other animals retreat deeper into the rain forest and, as much of the
low lying forest is flooded anyway, hunting is seriously disadvantaged.
There may be as much as a seven meter difference in water levels between
the dry and wet seasons.
As many anthropologists have noted, exchange and trade is a per­
vasive feature of the life of most New Guineans, and the Yimas are no
exception in this regard. Indeed, Yimas life is so structured by exchange
that people conceive of their relations to others primarily in terms of
exchange potential and responsibilities. All major rituals require an ex­
change of valuables. For example, when a villager dies, his relatives are
compensated by other villages with small payments of money; this is
regarded as part of the mourning ritual. Links with other villages are
almost exclusively structured in terms of exchange, and an important
trade network with Yimas as a pivotal link has existed for some time
in this area. As Gewertz (1983) has so clearly pointed out, a central
theme in Sepik societies is the asymmetrical exchange relationship be­
tween water and bush peoples. The bush peoples produce sago and trade
this with the water people for fish. As is typical throughout the world,
fish being a protein food is more prestigious, so that the exchange rate
favors the water people. As a water people, the Yimas enter into this
asymmetrical exchange relationship with the bush peoples speaking the
Arafundi and Alamblak languages to the east and west. These are long­
standing and important trade links, as demonstrated by the existence of
pidginized forms of Yimas which were used in these transactions (their
function has now been usurped by Tok Pisin).
These trading links persist today, but traditionally, Yimas was in­
volved in an even more extensive trading network. The flat, swampy
lands of the Yimas are especially valuable in that they produce strong
large strands of grass. These are collected, pounded flat, and woven
by the women into highly prestigious items throughout the middle and
lower Sepik: mosquito bags ( arv) (absolutely necessary in the mosquito
infested Sepik basin), various types of baskets, and sleeping mats ( irwa) .
In the past, men would fashion spears (ivkay) and bows (parmpan) and
arrows (piam) and would collect birds of paradise plumes ( warwarvkat)
from the nearby foothills to trade. These would be traded for clay pots
( yavi) , plates ( aprm), and hearths ( nuvkp) through the middlemen of
the middle Sepik, the Iatmul. This network has ceased to function since
World War II, but as far as I can reconstruct it from reports of older
villagers, it worked as follows. The Iatmul people of the villages at the
mouth of the Korosmeri and Karawari rivers, Mindimbit and Angriman,
��;rew tobacco and other goods and traded these with the people in the
Aibom village in Lake Chambri for the plates, pots, and hearths fash-14THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSioned there from the plentiful clay. The Iatmul then carried these to
Yimas to trade for the Yimas produced goods. My older informants
assure me that a special pidginized form of Iatmul was used in these
transactions. Although the pidgin is no longer known, this report is
consistent with Mead's (1935) claim of the widespread use of a jargon
Iatmul for intervillage trade in the middle Sepik. Further, both the
Yimas language and culture show unmistakable traces of importations
from Iatmul (Foley 1989).
Yimas, like Sepik societies generally, is strongly egalitarian in its so­
cial structure and ideology. There is no institutionalization of power and
authority, and the people are very resistant to any attempt to impose
someone else's will or decisions on them. The concept of advantageous
exchange remains the ideal even in interpersonal relationships. With
the lack of any institutionalized differences in status, social life is char­
acterized by incessant competition between individuals and clans, often
resulting in quarrels and even brawls. Individuals of both sexes are
proud, assertive, and demonstrative, but there are significant differences
in the social character of men and women which bear mentioning.
There is a strong sex-based differentiation of tasks in Yimas society,
and from a very early age boys and girls are separated. The life of
the women revolves around cooperative tasks such as fishing or making
sago thatch for roofing. Reflecting this, Yimas women tend to have a
practical, cooperative approach to life, and are interested primarily in
caring for their children. They lack the love of competitive display so
characteristic of the men, but exhibit a down-to-earth self-confidence.
It is important to note that Yimas women, in contrast to their sisters of
the highlands and western regions, are economically independent; they
produce the prestigious trade goods like fish and woven objects, and
they hold the rewards of this production.
In contrast, Yimas men are boastful, individually competitive, and
prone to aggression. They jealously guard their prerogatives and con­
stantly gossip, attempting to run down the reputation of rivals. Any per­
ceived status gain or economic reward is likely to be a cause of a quarrel
or worse. Yimas men find it virtually impossible to engage in large-scale
cooperative activities. What cooperation there is among them is gen­
erally the activity of close kin. If it were not for the activities of the
women, Yimas society would probably be subject to constant fissions,
as Bateson (1936) claims the Iatmal are, or would end up like the picture
of Mundugumor society that Mead (1935) draws.
Traditionally, the life of Yimas men, like so many Sepik societies,
revolved around the male cult house or house tambaran ( manm ) . These
houses were destroyed during World War II and never rebuilt, with theETHNOGRAPHIC SKETCH15result that all the important ritual life associated with these ceased be­
fore 1950. It is quite likely that the activities of the male cult house
provided a powerful integrating force in the life of the men, counter­
balancing the divisive effects of their competitive strivings, as appears
elsewhere in the Sepik (Tuzin 1974), and their disappearance might have
left a serious cultural vacuum. The male cult houses were the places
where the initiated men of the village spent most of their time, gossip­
ing, chewing betelnut, and doing small odd jobs. They were closed to
women and uninitiated boys under pain of death. Men typically slept
in their clan's cult house, not with their wives or children, who slept
together in the large family houses. Young boys were initiated into the
life of the male cult house in early puberty. They were secluded in the
cult house for several months and only allowed to go outside to bathe
in the dead of night so that they would not be seen by the women.
Within the cult house they were plastered with mud, beaten regularly
and only given the foulest of food to eat, which they were forbidden to
touch, being fed by their mother's brothers. In the final act of initiation,
their backs were cut transversely with sharp rocks, leaving permanent
scars.
All traditional Yimas religious life centered on the male cult house
(they are now baptized Roman Catholics, but many of the traditional
beliefs in spirits still persist). The male cult house held carvings and bark
paintings depicting the spirits of totemic ancestors, as well as fetishes,
such as stones that housed spirits. Religious rituals entailed making
entreaties to these spirits of totemic ancestors to provide benefits for
the living. Most of these rituals required the playing of paired bamboo
flutes (tavkut) , which were said to be the voices of the spirits. These
were kept in the cult house and hidden from women. Rituals would
typically go on all night or even for several nights in a row. Elaborate
rituals would precede all important male activities, such as raiding a
neighboring village. The Yimas were both headhunters and cannibals,
the former playing an especially important role in the culture of the
village. For example, only boys who had killed in a headhunting raid
were permitted to wear a pubic covering of a flying fox skin and hence
be eligible to take a wife. During the frenzied, all-night rituals which
preceded a headhunting raid, a man would often fall into trance, taken
by other men to be possession by a totemic spirit. He would then be
interviewed as to the prospects and proper procedures for a successful
raid. The most popular targets for Yimas raids were the Arafundi vil­
lages of Imanmeri and Wambramas-Yamandim and the Alamblak village
of Chimbut. Their only ally was the Arafundi speaking Auwim village.
Yimas society is built up out of kinship ties. In fact, unlike our16THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSwestern society, there are no other institutionalized social ties. The
largest kinship groups in the village are the patrilineal clans, each with
its own totemic ancestor(s) and totemic animal. For example, my main
informant's clan has the central totemic ancestor Kikay and the totem
the hornbill (kaykut) . Each clan is divided into two or more lineages.
Every member of the clan is given at birth a personal name drawn from
the names of the totemic ancestors of the clan. There are no specific
names for the clans in Yimas; rather, each takes its name from that
area of the village where its male cult house stood. There is also no
generic word for 'clan', the word anti 'land' being used instead. So to
say 'we are of the same clan', one would actually say 'we are of one land'.
The clans are the unit of marriage within the village. The Yimas are
largely endogamous (marrying inside the village), and marriage is across
clans. Tradition has long prescribed which clans are linked together in
marriage arrangements, and from a very early age, children are aware
as to who are permissible spouses within this schema. Within recent
years this has weakened somewhat, with couples occasionally marrying
according to personal choice, against the traditional arrangements. This
is frowned on by older villagers, but they shrug their shoulders and say
'this is another time'. There are also some traces of what may have
been a dual organization of the clans into two moieties. This seems to
have been involved in the initiation of boys in the male cult house and
other rituals associated with this, but as these had completely ceased
for over 25 years before I went to Yimas for the first time, it has proved
impossible to verify this.
The Yimas kinship system, like that of many Sepik societies, is a
Crow-Omaha variant (or, to be more precise, an Omaha system given
the patrilineal bias). Crow-Omaha systems are those which exhibit a
confl.ation of generations along the main line of descent. In Yimas, this
occurs because the paternal grandfather (father's father) is classified as
older brother (kpan) i.e., of the same generation as ego instead of two
generations above. This also has the peculiar effect of placing one's
own father in the class of one's son, because his father is one's older
brother (sons of a group of brothers are sons of each). Thus, one's
father is simultaneously one's son and one's son is simultaneously one's
father. I have often witnessed the event of a father addressing his five
year old son as api 'father' because of this generational collapsing. This
tallies well with Bateson's ( 1936, 38-41) point about the identification
of father and son in Iatmul society (also having a Crow-Omaha variant
for kinship terminology), but as far as I know, Yimas is the only culture
in which this identification finds articulation in the kinship terminology.
In the maternal clan, one's most important relation is mother's brotherETHNOGRAPHIC SKETCH17( away). He is always ready to provide support and take one's side in an
argument. Whereas there is some tension in the father/son relationship,
there is none in this maternal uncle/nephew kin link.
Yimas recorded history only stretches back about 50 years. Prior to
that, we must rely on oral history in the form of myths and legends (a
small amount of archeological work was very recently done at Yimas, but
no results are available just yet) . The Yimas legends indicate that it is
largely an immigrant village (see Harrison 1989 for a similar claim about
the prehistory of Manambu-speaking villages of the Sepik river). The
ancestors of the various clans came to Yimas from different areas: from
the Sepik river near the mouth of the Korosmeri-Karawari, from the
extensive swamps of the Blackwater river, a tributary of the Korosmeri,
from the foothills beyond the large southern group of Yimas lakes, and
from the mountainous country which forms the source for the Arafundi
river. The last group called their homeland Manki and today say that
it was also the homeland of the Chambri and Murik peoples. The myth
relates that after a quarrel with their menfolk over food, the women of
Manki drifted in a hollow log down the Arafundi river. At the junction
of the Arafundi and Karawari rivers, the log got tied up in some debris.
The women went ashore and climbed up the hill there and saw the
mountain behind the present Chambri village. Some determined to go
there. They reboarded their log and floated down the Karawari river
until it joins the Sepik. Here some of the women separated and went
to Lake Chambri, where they perfected the art of pottery making. The
rest remained on the log and floated down the Sepik to its mouth where
they married the men there. This legend is especially interesting in that
it provides a historical account for the clear genetic relationship between
the Yimas, Chambri and Murik languages.
The Yimas also have legends concerning a flooding of the site of the
village and the creation of land out of endless expanse of water, both of
which correlate quite closely with recent speculations on the prehistory
of the Sepik area (Swadling 1984) . Other legends give explanations for
natural phenomena, such as why flying foxes sleep hanging upside down
in trees, or for cultural themes, like the origin of bamboo flutes. Many
of the legends related by men show a deep distrust and fear of the power
of women, a not unusual theme in New Guinea.
Yimas contact with the western world only came in the 1930s, and
then it was only marginal. Their major induction into the modern world
was the Japanese invasion of northern New Guinea in World War II. This
was a very traumatic period for the Yimas, as the Japanese stationed a
small garrison in the village and irrevocably disrupted much of their life
and culture. The male cult houses were destroyed, and all their associ-18THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSated rituals abandoned. The entire village was burned during a bombing
raid. The massive technological superiority of the western world left a
deep impression on the Yimas, and following the war they determined
to follow European practices with a view to acquiring European made
goods. They moved down from the original village site on the hill above
the river (a good defensive position) and built their houses along the
river, hoping to attract European interests. They abandoned their tra­
ditional religion of the male cult house, converted to Roman Catholicism
and built a church. Yimas children of both sexes have gone to school
since the mid-1960s. But western type development and western-made
goods have been slow in coming. The only source of work in the area is
a tourist lodge which employs about a half dozen Yimas. In spite of the
appearance of goods like outboard motors and cassette players, Yimas
life still largely revolves around subsistence hunting and gathering. For
most Yimas, daily life is pretty much as it was 50 years ago, although a
little easier. The major casualty of western contact has been their ritual
and spiritual life. (Virtually no traditional legends are known by anyone
under 30.) The young have no interest in them, preferring electrified
music from Port Moresby and New York.
1.4 Sepik Area Languages in General and the Lower Sepik
Family in Particular
Excluding the languages of the upper Sepik and the Torrecelli mountains
which are very diverse, but are beyond the purview of this study, the
languages of the Sepik-Ramu basin number about 80 in over a dozen lan­
guage families. In spite of such great genetic diversity, the languages of
many different families often share a number of structural traits. This
diffusion is a linguistic reflection of the pronounced consciousness of
trade and exchange discussed in the previous section. Because of trade
and other cultural links, a village's language is subject to strong influ­
ences from the outside. Further, shared linguistic allegiance is insuffi­
cient as a basis for intercommunity solidarity. The Karawari language
is spoken by around 1 ,500 people in ten villages. Dialect differentiation
is not great, but there is little feeling of a larger community composed
of the villages speaking Karawari. Some Karawari villages have closer
cultural links to villages speaking other languages such as Iatmul or An­
goram, than to those speaking Karawari. Iatmul villages provide another
example; they often raided and headhunted in other Iatmul villages, the
shared language being no hindrance in this regard. Clearly, in the Sepik
region, shared linguistic allegiance is not a rallying point for cultural
cohesion.
Given this situation, it is not surprising that frequent shifting of lan-8EPIK AREA LANGUAGES AND THE LOWER 8EPIK FAMILY19guage boundaries is common in this area of New Guinea. Like other
cultural artifacts, language is a trade item. Villages on the border be­
tween two language groups may shift their linguistic allegiance if their
shifting cultural and economic links would seem to warrant this. Some
border villages may be so precariously balanced linguistically that it is
difficult to determine their affiliation. Some individuals and families are
bilingual; others speak only one of the two languages. Mead ( 1938, 159)
mentions the case of Ulup village on the border between the Arapesh
and Abelam languages. These two languages are structurally very dif­
ferent and belong to different language families. Neither the Arapesh,
nor the Abelam, nor the inhabitants of the village themselves were sure
of Ulup's affiliations. In a shifting situation like this the final result may
be that small language groups are gradually assimilated and disappear
entirely. (See Foley 1989 for further discussion of the points of this and
the previous paragraph.)
Given a sociolinguistic situation like this, it comes as no surprise that
genetically unrelated languages over a wide area often display remark­
ably uniform structural features. Phonologically, for example, nearly all
languages of the area are characterized for a short high to mid-central
vowel, non-phonemic and epenthetically introduced to separate imper­
missible consonant clusters. A common consonantal pattern is to have
stops in four places of articulation (labial, dental, palatal, and velar) ,
with a corresponding nasal i n each position. This is attested, for exam­
ple, in such widely geographically separated languages as Yimas, Abelam
(Maprik area), and Mikarew (Ramu river). Prenasalized stops are com­
mon, but are sometimes best analyzed as clusters consisting of a stop
preceded by a homorganic nasal. Unlike other areas of New Guinea, a
phonemic contrast between two liquids, /r/ and /1/, is not uncommon.
Suprasegmental phenomena are limited to stress; languages with phone­
mic tone are unattested, in contrast to their common occurrence in the
central highlands.
With the notable exception of the Lower Sepik family and a few
others, languages of the Sepik-Ramu region are morphologically rather
Himple. What affixation there is is largely suffixal, but again, the Lower
Sepik family is an exception. All languages make a sharp distinction
between noun and verb. Nouns are simpler morphologically than verbs;
in some languages the only common nominal inflections are suffixes to
mark oblique cases, as in Iatmul (Staalsen 1972) ( Vk<Jy-mpa house-LOC
'in the house'). Languages of the lower Sepik and Ramu rivers area
commonly have complex, highly irregular plural formations. Compare
these forms from Miyak (Yuat river) , Angoram (lower Sepik river) and
Kaian (Ramu river; Z'graggen 1971 ) :THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERS20

the overall plural-marking system of the three languages is quite similar
and clearly an areal feature.
Another areal feature of the region concerns the possessive mor­
pheme. In all languages this is a suffix or postposition and occurs in
one of two forms: -kV or - nV. Unrelated, geographically widely sepa­
rated languages will often show agreement in the morpheme form chosen
for this function. For example, Miyak (Yuat river) and Tangu (Ramu
river; Z'graggen 1971) both employ -kV (M: va-k'J ken 1SG-POSS dog
'my dog', T: ku-ka riei 1SG-POSS dog 'my dog'), while Yimas, like all
Lower Sepik languages, and Kaian (Z'graggen 1971) both use -nV (Y:
ama-na mamay 1SG-POSS brother 'my brother', K: lA-na yakay 1SG­
POSS brother 'my brother'). While the possessor precedes the possessed
in these cases (and this is the usual pattern) , it is not always so (Emerum
(upper Ramu river: Z'graggen 1971): isam ya-ka brother 1SG-POSS 'my
brother'). Proto-Ndu and most of the languages of this family have an
interesting variant on this theme; they use - nV if the possessor is first­
or second-person and -kV if it is third-person.
Verbal morphology of Sepik region languages is on the whole rather
simple. In many languages the only affixation is suffixation for tense/as­
pect/mood (Yessan-Mayo (middle Sepik; cf. Foreman 1974): yi-we go­
NR PAST 'went', Miyak (Yuat river): som-b-a cook-PRES-INDIC 'cook­
ing', Bosman (between the Sepik and Ramu rivers; cf. Capell 1951):
vas-et see-PAST 'saw', Abelam (Maprik area; cf. Wilson 1980): k-'Jk eat­
PAST 'ate') . In addition to tense/aspect/mood suffixes, a minority of
languages have subject agreement suffixes, cross-referencing the person
and number of the subject of transitive and intransitive verbs (Iatmul
(Staalsen 1972) : yi-b-win go-PRES-1SG 'I am going') . More complex
verbal morphology than this in the area is rare, although quite commonSEPIK AREA LANGUAGES AND THE LOWER SEPIK FAMILY21elsewhere in New Guinea. Only the languages of the Lower Sepik family
and some contiguous languages in the region ( Gapun, Alamblak, and
Arafundi) have both subject and object agreement. The relevant af­
fixes are prefixes in Lower Sepik languages (Yimas: pu-ka-tay-pcut 3PL
0-1SG A-see-RM PAST 'I saw them') but suffixes in Alamblak (Bruce
1984) (fayk-r-m get-3SG M A-3PL 0 'he got them') and Arafundi (yep7)gi-na-cik see-3PL O-FUT-1SG A 'I will see them') .
All Papuan languages of the Sepik-Ramu region have typological
characteristics of verb final languages. Many, perhaps most, of these
have rather rigid subject/object/verb word order.

Note that the Bosman and Miyak examples show case-marking on the

in lacking case suffixes. One fairly common feature of Sepik languages
is the use of the dative case suffix to mark animate, particularly human,
direct objects.

Sepik languages with rather richer morphology, including nominal gen­

Yimas, for example, is extremely free in its word order, as seems to be
true of thP: other Lower Sepik languages.(1-5) a. Yessan-Mayo:

All Sepik area languages attested make use of dependent medial verb

subjects of the linked clauses are the same (but see Section 7.3.1 for a
discussion of the complications in this regard in Yimas) . Consider these
examples of clauses linked with dependent medial verb forms:

When compared to the general picture of the linguistic scene of the
Sepik-Ramu region just sketched, the languages of the Lower Sepik fam­
ily emerge as a great anomaly in many grammatical respects. Phonolog­
ically they fit quite well, but morphologically they are very divergent.
Lower Sepik languages are highly elaborated morphologically, and most
are just as heavily prefixing as suffixing, if not more so. They tend to
have quite free word order at the clausal level and a weak development
of dependent verb forms.
The languages of the Lower Sepik family are relatively closely re­
lated, roughly on the order of the Germanic family. There are six mem­
ber languages in the family: Yimas (250 speakers) , Karawari ( 1,500
speakers), Angoram (7,000 speakers) , Chambri (1 ,200 speakers) , Murik
( 1,500 speakers) and Kopar (250 speakers) . Map 2 gives the relative
positions of these languages. Murik and Kopar are very closely related,
almost dialects of the same language, so I will treat them as one for the
purposes here. The 25 cognate sets in Table 1 demonstrate this close
relationship of the languages. (K after a form indicates that it is Kopar,
not Murik) . In Foley (1986, 215-20) , I attempted a careful, somewhat
detailed, reconstruction of the phonology of the protolanguage; I will
simply summarize the results here. Proto-Lower Sepik had a phonemic
system of consonants like the following:
*p
(* b)
*mp
* mb
*m
*w*t
*d
* nt
* nd
*s
*n
*r
*y*k
( * g)
* :uk
*:g g
*:uThis system is rather tentative; only Chambri preserves the distinction
hdween the voiceless and voiced prenasalized stops, the other languages
uwrging them. Further, the plain voiced series is established on the basis
of a single sound correspondence establishing *d in one cognate set. If020

M, A, C :Y, K:
ueuo
aaProto-Lower Sepik appears to have been like Murik, Angoram, and
Chambri, Yimas and Karawari having merged the relatively rare mid
vowels to /af. Yimas and (to a lesser extent) Karawari have also
undergone an extensive process of vowel centralization, the peripheral
high vowels being attracted to the central /i/. In phonemic terms this
amounts to vowel deletion, for the /i/ is typically epenthetic in these
languages, breaking up impermissible clusters.
All the Lower Sepik languages have complex morphologies, with Yi­
mas being the most elaborate in this regard. All the languages except
Murik-Kopar have an extensive system of noun classes with assignment
to class being determined by a mix of semantic and phonological cri­
teria. For example, in Karawari, there are three semantically-based
classes-class I (male humans) , class II (female humans), and class III
(higher animals)-and six phonologically based classes-class V (ending
in mb) , class VI (ending in (- '!79) , and class VII (ending in -i or y), etc.
Proto-Lower Sepik had seven noun classes, as follows:
--/noun classesanimate-----inanimate/I�plantsphonologically-basedIIIII IV V VI VIIIII IIIThis system is essentially preserved in Angoram and Chambri, but Yi­
mas and Karawari have added to it by distinguishing humans from other
animates, and within humans, distinguishing male and female. A fur­
ther innovation in Karawari is the merger of the functional plants class
with the phonologically based class of nouns ending in - i or -y. These
noun classes are manifested in the grammars of all four languages by
concord suffixes on all nominal modifiers and agreement prefixes (or suf­
fixes in Angoram) on the verb for subject and object, as illustrated by
this example for Karawari:

as the reconstruction for a couple of other noun classes, see Foley 1986
(pp. 222-9).
As mentioned above, Murik today lacks noun classes, but it does
have traces of them. First of all, both the numerals for 'two' and 'three'
begin in k, an unmistakable fossilization of the class VI concord prefix
for numerals * k- : kompari (K) 'two' and kerongo 'three' from * k- class
VI marker plus *pa- 'two' or * ram- 'three' plus *-ri DL or *-vk PC.
Second, Murik nouns, while not marked for noun class, are inflected for
number, and nominal modifiers take suffixes indicating number agree­
ment, both vestiges of the earlier noun class system. These suffixes are
given below,
SG

PC
PLNADJ-mbo
-gi/-moara
-mot-abo
-ara
-k0-0and exemplified in the following: 'big person' SG nor apo, DL norimbo
apaabo, PC norigi apaara, PL normot apak . Murik is the only Lower
Sepik language to distinguish a paucal number for nouns; most (Yimas,
Chambri and Karawari) only distinguish three numbers, singular, dual
and plural, and Angoram has only a simple singular/plural contrast.
Yet there is reason to believe that Murik is conservative in this respect.
Most of the languages (Murik, Yimas and Chambri) distinguish a paucal
number in their personal pronouns. Also, the plural allomorphs for
nouns in most of the languages are highly irregular (in contrast to theSEPIK AREA LANGUAGES AND THE LOWER SEPIK FAMILY29dual inflections) and some of these allomorphs end in /r/ (Yimas /t/),
close to the Murik paucal forms in - r . This suggests the proto-Lower
Sepik may have inflected nouns for all four numbers, but that in most
languages the paucal and plural merged, some noun classes and words
taking the old paucal suffix as their plural marker and others taking the
old plural. This would account for the unusually complex allomorphs
for plural marking of nouns in most of the languages.
The verbal morphology of all Lower Sepik languages is very elabo­
rate, and all follow a basically agglutinative model. All languages but
Angoram are predominately prefixing, although tense is generally a suf­
fix (Murik is the exception here) . All languages make at least a tense
distinction between past, present and future, but most are more com­
plicated than that. Yimas and Murik (Abbott 1978) distinguish two
future tenses (near and remote) , while Yimas has multiple past tenses
(near, far and remote) . A typical tense form for each of the languages
is illustrated below:
Yimas:ama-wa-nan
1SG S-go-NR PAST
'I went . 'Karawari: ama-kurayk-nan
1SG S-walk-PAST
'I walked.'","[46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51]"
"AN EXPLICIT ACCOUNT OF YIMAS VERBAL MORPHOLOGY3536.4 An Explicit Account of Yimas Verbal Morphology
In the last chapter and the previous sections of this chapter, I have pre­
sented a detailed discussion of the structure and categories of Yimas
verbal morphology. Within the verb, I have distinguished three levels of
structure: root, stem, and theme, and I have shown how the morphemes
of these three levels interact. I have also attempted a fairly careful de­
scription of the meanings and functions of the morphemes in the various
morphological categories, such as tense suffixes, pronominal affixes and
valence altering affixes, etc. In this section, I will try to draw all this
together and present a fairly explicit and coherent account of Yimas
verbal morphology.
Perhaps the primary bifurcation in the Yimas verb is that reflected
in the division of material between this chapter and the previous one.
This is the split between the categories within the verb theme, e.g. , ad­
verbials, serialized verbs, valence altering affixes, and those outside of
it, e.g., pronominal affixes, aspect, tense, and mood. In more traditional
terms, this corresponds. to the difference between derivational and inflec­
tional morphology, respectively. Derivational morphology is normally
described as that belonging properly to the lexicon, generating a new
complex form from a simplex base form, while inflectional morphology is
held to belong to the clause as a whole, specifying semantic and syntac­
tic categories at this level. Derivational morphology is usually optional,
while some categories of inflectional morphology in a language are of­
ten obligatory. While this distinction can be drawn in Yimas (as I just
did above), I do not believe it is of any great value in the description
of the language. I believe that ultimately all of the verbal morphology
in Yimas is produced as the result of derivational processes. There is
no sudden switch in the structural behavior of the verbal morphology
when one passes from inside of the verb theme to outside, so there are
no motivated grounds for drawing a distinction between two types of
morphology at this boundary. Rather the whole structure of a Yimas
verb is the result of ordered processes of morphological derivation, as I
will demonstrate below.
But before proceeding to this, let me first dispose of the argument
that the verbal morphology should be produced via syntactic rules. I
cannot consider all classes of morphology here, so let me consider what
might be the most promising cases-valence altering. There are a cou­
ple of compelling arguments for treating valence changing as a lexical
derivation process and not a case of a syntactic rule. First, note that
although Yimas has numerous productive valence increasing affixes, the
final output of these derivations can never be more than a trivalent verb
stem, the maximum permitted for underived verb roots like va- 'give' or354THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREi- 'tell'. In other words, the result of the valence increasing rules must
be the equivalent of the valence of a base lexical item. This constraint
makes sense if the valence increasing rules occur in the lexicon, but does
not if they are independent syntactic processes.
Now let me consider the second argument. Remember, as noted in
earlier sections, that valence increasing prefixes may have alternate con­
structions involving postpositions, as in the following examples, repeated
from previous sections.( 6-150) a. ipa kantk pu-mampi-wa-k
1PL with 3PL S-again-go-IRR
'They went with us. '
b . pu-kra-mampi-tau-wa-k
3PL A-1PL 0-again-COM-go-IRR
'They went with us.'
( 6-151 ) a. na-nampan na-way-mpi-ya-ntut
3SG-toward 3SG S-turn-SEQ-come-RM PAST
'He turned back and came toward her.'
b. na-n-way-mpi-ira-ya-ntut
3SG 0-3SG A-turn-SEQ-ALL-come-RM PAST
'He turned back and came toward her.'
In the ( a) examples, a participant in the event appears as an oblique
phrase, while in the ( b ) examples, it is a core argument. Thus, oblique
nominals marked by the postpositions kantk 'with' and nampan 'toward'
correspond to core nominals coded by the valence increasing prefixes tav­
COM or ira- ALL, respectively. From the structural alternations and the
paraphrase equivalences between the ( a) and (b ) examples above, one
may conclude that there is a convincing case for a productive syntactic
process in Yimas which promotes oblique nominals to core arguments,
much as dative shift constructions are commonly analyzed in English:
he gave a book to Mary becomes he gave Mary a book.
This analysis, however, runs into immediate problems when we con­
sider the entire range of valence increasing affixes in Yimas. For most
of these, unlike tav- COM and ira- ALL, there is simply no alternative
construction in which the core argument licensed by the valence increas­
ing prefix appears as an oblique nominal. In other words, there are no
paraphrase equivalents such as the ( a) examples in ( 6-150) and ( 6-151 )
for these examples:( 6-152 ) a. na-n-taukway-iray-Jlcut
3SG 0-3SG A-VIS-cry-RM PAST
'He cried over her.' ( looking at her body)AN EXPLICIT ACCOUNT OF YIMAS VERBAL MORPHOLOGY355b. na-n-pampay-iray-pra-k
3SG 0-3SG A-KIN-cry-toward-IRR
'He cried carrying her toward the village.'
The ideas behind the examples in (6-152) can only be expressed in this
way; alternatives with oblique nominals do not exist (although para­
phrases employing two clauses are possible). This casts grave doubt on
the productive syntactic analysis of valence increasing in Yimas. There
are no plausible underlying syntactic constructions from which the ex­
amples in (6-152) can be derived. Rather one must conclude that they
(and, by extension (6- 150b) and (6- 151b)) are base generated. Further,
because the sequence of valence affix plus verb root forms a single verb
stem, this base generation must be accomplished by morphological rules
and most likely accomplished in the lexicon.
Having established the morphological basis of such processes as va­
lence changing, it is now time to turn to a more detailed account of
the derivation of Yimas verb forms. This model of Yimas verbal mor­
phology means that the entire polysynthetic structure of a verb, with
all its elaborate morphological specifications, is produced by a complex,
ordered series of derivations. The morphological rules which accomplish
these derivations are located in a component of the lexicon. It will be the
task of the remainder of this section to elucidate explicitly the internal
structure of this derivational process in its various stages.
The starting point, of course, for all Yimas verbs is a verb root: these
are all entered separately in the lexicon. Let us represent a verb root
with the symbol Vo .
The next state is the derivation of verb stems from verb roots. The
verb stem is represented by V1. There are a number of processes which
derive verb stems, i.e., convert Yo to V 1 : reduplication, noun incorpora­
tion, and valence altering. These processes are themselves hierarchically
arranged. The most basic, i.e the one applied first, is reduplication.
Reduplication seems to be the most lexicalized of all derivational pro­
cesses: there are two bits of evidence to support this. First, there is a
special dissimilation rule that applies to reduplicated forms that does
not apply elsewhere in the grammar (rule (2-7)) . This removes the F
autosegment from a reduplicated segment, so that wul- 'put in water'
reduplicated is wurt-, not *wult-. This is a specialized phonological rule,
something to be expected for a highly lexicalized process. Second, Yi­
mas has some irregular reduplicated forms: ira- 'dance' reduplicated is
iranta-, not *irata- . This, again, would be expected of a highly lexi­
ealized process. So, applying reduplication to two representative verb
roots, we have the following derivations:356
(6-153)THE V ERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTURE
v1/ �REDREDVo\�a i'put in'/Vo\J/a k'break'arkarkapapiThis derivation can be stated as the lexical rule V 1 = (RED) + Vo .
The next stem-level derivational process is noun incorporation. As
mentioned in Section 6.2.5, this is a sporadic process which often re­
sults in idiomatic constructions, a feature diagnostic of a highly lexi­
calized process. The only productive type is incorporation of nominal­
ized adjectives. Diagrammatic examples of noun incorporation are given
below:

ADJ
AGRIIkpati-urn

'become'
Combining reduplication and noun incorporation in one lexical rule, we
have V1 = (N) + (RED) + Vo .
Finally, we turn to the most common and most varied type of verb
stem derivation: valence alterations. All valence changing processes but
possessor raising and va- BEN are possible at the level of the verb stem.
A couple of examples illustrating valence changing inside serial verb
constructions (hence on the level of the verb stem) follow:

Valence altering affixes not uncommonly co-occur with the other two
derivational categories of the verb stem, reduplication and noun incor­
poration.","[374, 375, 376, 377, 378]"

ti- 'become, fell' is normally an intransitive verb, but in (5-71a) it has
two affixes, S and D; kra- 'cut' is a transitive verb, but in (5-71b) it has
three pronominal affixes, S, 0, and D. These D affixes mark fully core
arguments: whatever processes are available to D affixes on ditransitive
verbs are available to these as well, e.g., relativization, anaphoric control
over non-finite modifiers, etc. (see Chapter 7) . By assuming that the
pronominal affixes directly fill the core argument positions of the verb,
this is easily explicable. But otherwise it is not, for the nouns which
these affixes reference are only possessors of other core arguments, the
S in (5-71a) and the 0 in (5-71b). While these may be coded as core
arguments through the verbal prefixes, they may not appear as core
arguments in their own right:

These examples are ungrammatical because these possessors may
not be treated as core (i.e., lacking the oblique suffix) unless linked to
a pronominal affix. The contrast in grammaticality between (5-71) and
(5-72) clearly demonstrates that it is the pronominal affixes which confer
core status and, in fact, fill the argument slots of a verb.
Thus far, I have been discussing referents which are old or established
information and can therefore be indicated by a pronominal affix. What
about new information, characters or props now just being introduced
in the discourse? These can appear with or without a pronominal affix
so that in essence we have the three following structural patterns:
Pattern 1 :
Pattern 2 :
Pattern 3:0
NP
NPPRO-verb
PRO-verb
verbestablished referent
established/new referent
new referentwhere 0 means no overt noun phrase and PRO any pronominal affix.
Pattern 1 has already been illustrated and discussed elsewhere (exam­
ples (5-67a,b) and discussion thereof) , as has pattern 2 for established
referents (examples 5-65a,b) . In considering how new referents are intro-THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS233duced, let me consider the unambiguous case, pattern 3, first. Examples
of this follow:
(5-73) a. num-n-mat
Kampramanan wapal-k

'The villagers climbed Kampramanan. '
paympan
b . m-n

'It, the eagle, saw those two.'
pu-nan-JJa-t
c. patn
betelnut V SG 3PL A-2SG D-give-PERF
'They gave you betelnut.'
(5-73a) has an intransitive verb, wapal- 'climb', with no pronominal
affixes; (5-73b) a transitive verb, tay- 'see', with only one pronominal
affix, that of the 0 argument; and ( 5-73c) a ditransitive verb, va- 'give',
with only two pronominal affixes, A and D. In each case, the missing
core argument is provided by an overt noun in the clause: numunmat
'villagers' in (5-72a) , paympan 'eagle' in (5-73b) , and patn 'betelnut' in
(5-73c). These examples all come from running texts in which these
nouns are just being introduced or re-introduced after a longish gap.
They are new information.
Given the earlier claim that the pronominal affixes fill the argument
positions of the verb, an important question is what is the relationship
to the verb of these nouns without coreferent agreement affixes? The
simple answer is just the same, but in this case they are linked to a
zero pronominal affix. In other words, Yimas has much in common
with the feature of uncontrolled 'pronoun drop' in East Asian languages
like Japanese, Thai, and Indonesian. To see how this analysis would
work, consider (5-73b) again. The transitive verb tay- 'see' has two core
arguments, A and 0 (I am here considering the notion of transitivity and
associated arguments to be a straightforward notion in Yimas. This
is not entirely the case, but it is best to postpone the discussion of
this until Section 6.2.1.). This transitive verb only has a single overt
agreement prefix, the prefix impa- 3DL 0, but, as it is a transitive verb,
it must have an A participant. Because of pragmatic reasons, i.e., the
referent of the A is a new participant, this is realized by a zero prefix.
A zero prefix is exactly that, one which has no specifications for class,
person and number and may therefore be linked to any noun which is
morphologically marked as core, i.e. , is not suffixed with the oblique
suffix -n """" - nan. Both noun phrases in (5-73b) meet this requirement,
m-n NR DIST III SG and paympan eagle III SG. But as they have the
Harne noun class and number specifications, they clearly have the same234BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYreferent, which is linked to the zero A prefix and interpreted with the A
role.
Example ( 5-73c) is similar, except that it contains a ditransitive verb
va- 'give' with overt agreement prefixes for A and D, but a zero prefix
for T. The clause contains a morphologically core noun patn 'betelnut'
which is linked to the verb through the zero T prefix and interpreted as
the theme.
Now consider example ( 5-73a) . This sentence contains an intransi­
tive verb, wapal 'climb', with no agreement prefixes and two associated
noun phrases. One of these, numnmat 'villagers', is morphologically a
core argument; the other, Kampramanan 'place name', is morphologi­
cally oblique, with the oblique suffix -n ""' - nan. Hence only numnmat
'villagers' may be linked to the zero S prefix on the verb and interpreted
in the S role.
This last example points up a very important constraint on the gram­
maticality of Yimas clauses which I will call the completeness constraint
(Foley and Van Valin 1984, 183) . It states that a noun may be realized
morphologically as a core argument (i.e., without the oblique suffix - n ""'
- nan) if and only if it is linked to a pronominal affix on the verb (which
may be zero). In other words, a noun without the oblique suffix must
be linked to a pronominal affix and a noun with it never can. The verb
wapal- 'climb' is a good one to illustrate this principle with. Although
basically intransitive, as in (5-73a) , it is actually ambitransitive like its
English equivalent. English climb is intransitive in the child climbed to
the top of the tree but formally transitive in the child climbed the tree.
Yimas behaves identically.

b. irpm

'He climbed the coconut palm.'
(5-74a) contains wapal- 'climb' used intransitively with a single S prefix.
The noun irpm-un coconut palm IV SG-OBL is not a core argument and
therefore occurs with the oblique suffix. In (5-74b), the verb wapal is
used transitively and has both the A prefix n- 3SG A and the 0 prefix
mu- IV SG 0. Now irpm 'coconut palm' must be realized morpholog­
ically as a core argument and lack the oblique suffix. The use of the
oblique suffix in (5-74b) will result in ungrammaticality.

used to express new referents, let me return briefly to the case of pat­
tern 2 constructions (i.e. , NP PRO-verb), which may also express new
referents. It is important to remember that pattern 2 is potentially
ambiguous; it can also express established referents, as illustrated in
(5-65) . Pattern 2 , (noun phrase plus PRO-verb) commonly has a strong
contrastive component to its meaning. For example, it is generally used
in answer to an information question when the question word functions
as 0 or D.
(5-76) a. Q: nawn ma-tpul
who 2SG S-hit
'Who did you hit?'
b. A: .uaykum
pu-ka-tpul
woman II PL 3PL 0-lSG A-hit
'I hit the women'
Here, vaykum 'women' is the focus of the answer. This is indicated both
by an independent noun and the verbal agreement affix pu- 3PL 0.
In other cases, new referents are introduced through pattern 2 if they
are especially important new props in the development in the discourse
around which its progression turns, as in this example from a traditional
legend:
( 5-77) JlCt
mnta
ya-n-awa-ta-k-nakn
urine V PL and then V PL 0-3SG-excrete-put-IRR-3SG D
'And then she urinated on him.'
Although pet 'urine' is a new participant here, it is an important one,
because by noticing the urine, the man locates his daughter, and the
remaining plot of the story unfolds.
These examples are meant to give the reader a general feel for the
pragmatic, discourse-based differences which determine the choices of
pattern 1, 2 or 3. Because they are pragmatic and discourse-based, it is
impossible to write hard and fast, all-encompassing rules. Rather, there
are devices left open to the speaker to use creatively as he frames the
text. Some of the general principles involved I have discussed here, but
a more complete account will have to remain for a later more detailed
Htudy of Yimas discourse structures. The reader who is especially inter­
eHted is invited to study the texts at the end of this grammar and try
to work out some of these principles himself.
�.2 Tense, Aspect, and Mood
Yimas has a very rich system of tense, aspect, and mood distinctions.
Some aspectual distinctions are expressed through incorporated adver-BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY236bials and compounded verb stems and will be discussed in the relevant
sections in the next chapter (Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2). In this section, I
will only treat the aspect distinctions which are indicated in the suffixal
slots. Mood really corresponds to two separate inflectional categories in
Yimas: modality and illocutionary force. Modality is expressed through
a set of modal prefixes which occur verb-initially, before the pronomi­
nal prefixes, while illocutionary force distinctions such as imperatives or
hortatives are indicated by distinctive inflectional patterns with specific
pronominal affixes.
5.2.1 The Tense/ Aspect System
The only affixal position of a finite verb which is obligatorily occupied is
that of tense. This is a suffixal position following the verb stem(s) and
preceding the paucal and dative suffixes. If these latter are lacking, it
will occur in word final position.
(5-78) a. patn

'We gave betelnut to them long ago.'
b. tan ipa-wa-ntut
there 1PL S-go-RM PAST
'We went there long ago. '
Note the alternation between the non-final form of the RM PAST tense
suffix, ntuk , and the final form, - ntut. This pattern of alternation be­
tween non-final and final forms is a common feature of the tense suffixes
in Yimas.
The tense/ aspect system of Yimas makes nine distinctions. The pri­
mary distinction is strictly not one of tense, but a modal one. But since
this is realized in the same suffixal slot as all the other tense distinctions,
it will be treated as part of the same paradigmatic system here. Thus,
the basic distinction in the Yimas tense/aspect system is between unreal
and real events. Unreal events are marked by the irrealis suffix -k ""' - T)k,
which indicates that the event so marked is outside the continuum of real
time, e.g. , in the legendary past or in the indefinite future (see Section
5.2.1.1). Real events must be marked by one of the other tense/aspect
suffixes. These express an eight way contrast. Yimas has two basic past
tenses: a near past, for events which occurred yesterday; and a remote
past, for events which occurred any time since the legendary past up
to about five days ago. In addition there is a far past, composed of
the remote past suffix plus the suffix -kia, discussed in Section 5.2.1.2,
which is used for events occurring from two days ago to five days ago,
although the boundary between this and the remote past is flexible, and
-TENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD237a switch from the remote past to the far past is often used for nuances
of vividness in narratives. The present tense is used to express events
which occurred today, but is divided according to aspectual contrasts.
There is a three-way aspectual contrast for present tense: perfective, for
events which are completed; imperfective, for events which are ongoing;
and habitual, for events which recur regularly according to the normal
expectations of life patterns in the community. Finally, there are two
future tenses: a remote future, for events which are fully expected to
occur the day after tomorrow or later; and a near future, for events
expected to occur tomorrow. The contrasts in the Yimas tense-aspect
system may be summarized in the following schema:
events
----- ---real
unreal
------ 1 ------present
past
future
--- I -----._
/ """"---- � ---RM PAST FR PAST NR PAST PERFIMPERF HABNR FUT RM FUT5.2.1.1 Irrealis
The irrealis suffix is used in Yimas to indicate events which are located
outside of the continuum of real time: they must be completely timeless,
in the legendary past or in the indefinite future. In other words, it marks
events whose temporal coordinates cannot clearly be fixed by the speaker
in what he regards as experiential time. Because the irrealis occurs at
both ends of the temporal continuum, it may be conjectured that Yimas
speakers view time not as an open infinitely expandable line, but as a
closed circle.
UNREAL TIME
IRR
PRESENT
REAL TIME
This is a tempting speculation, but there is no evidence at present, other
t han the distribution of the irrealis suffix to affirm or deny it.
The use of the irrealis to express timeless events is prototypically
indicated by its use with the copula. If the reader will glance back at
the forms of the copula in Section 5.1.5, he will note that all forms
l.!�rminate in the irrealis -k. The copula is used in statements which hold238BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYtrue generally and are not bound to particular periods of time. In fact
the use of any other tense/aspect/mood inflection with the copula is
ungrammatical.
The irrealis suffix is probably most commonly found in traditional
legends, where it is almost invariably used, although the remote past
would also be an option. Consider the following:
(5-79) a. tan impa-ampu-mpi-awl-k
there 3DL S-float-SEQ-take-IRR
'They both drifted there.'
b. impa-mpu-yakal-irm-tay-Jlcut
3DL 0-3PL A-CONT-stand-see-RM PAST
'They stood watching them both.'
These two examples come from the same text and are separated only by
a single sentence. Both take place in exactly the same time period, the
legendary past, yet one is marked with the irrealis and the other with
the remote past suffix. In terms of absolute time reference, there is no
difference in this text between the irrealis and the remote past. But the
use of the remote past implies that events occurred in the stream of real,
albeit remote, time, while the irrealis removes them from the continuum
of real time altogether and situates them in the period before real time
as apprehended by men began. The use of the remote past in such
traditional legends is actually rather less common. In the text from
which the sentences in (5-79) were drawn, that of the creation myth,
less than 20% of all sentences in the legendary past are inflected with
the remote past suffix, the rest occur with the irrealis. Quite commonly,
a speaker will start a legend with the remote past suffix, but by the
third or fourth sentence will switch to the irrealis and remain with that
through the rest of the text. Also, it is sometimes the case that a speaker
will switch from the irrealis to the remote past in the denouement of a
text: this provides a vivid or immediate coloring to the events described.
The irrealis may also mark as yet unrealized future events. In this
case, it contrasts with the remote future tense. Consider these examples:
(5-80) a. ama patn
wayk-k
lSG betelnut V SG buy-IRR
'I want to/will buy betelnut.'
b. patn
na-ka-wayk-kt
betelnut V SG V SG 0-lSG A-buy-RM FUT
'I will buy betelnut after tomorrow.'
The remote future suffix -kt , as in (5-80b) , commits the speaker to the
belief that the event described will definitely or at least is highly likely
to occur in the future. The irrealis suffix requires no such commitment.","[253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260]"

the contrast between visible and invisible discussed in Section 3.8, the
former being the visible form and the latter the invisible. The nouns
forming classes by themselves also have distinct copula forms,

It should be noted that every form of the copula ends in -k. This is none
other than the irrealis suffix and is obligatory on the copula because the
statements in which it occurs are not bound in time. These statements
of identity or ascription of qualities are not held to a particular temporal
frame of reference, but are held to be true generally, or at least without
clearly defined temporal limits. If the statement is bound within some
statable temporal limits, then the verb ti- 'become, feel, do' must be
nsed with a tense suffix.

The Grammatical Status and Pragmatic Functions of the
Pronominal Affixes
! laving now expended a great deal of effort to understand the complexity
to which Yimas has elaborated its system of pronominal affixes, the
reader will probably be surprised to discover that they are not obligatory.
This is not to say that they are not very common; they certainly are.
The great majority of transitive verbs in discourse, for example, have
both an A and an 0 prefix attached to them. But the fact remains that
they are an option, and it is the purpose of this section to outline what
are the factors which determine these choices and, further, what is the
��;rammatical status of these affixes on verbs which contain them.
To borrow terminology from Bresnan and Mchombo (1987) , the Yi­
maH pronominal affixes are examples of pronominal agreement rather
than grammatical agreement. The idea behind this contrast is not new:
5 . 1 .6228BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYit is basically the analysis of Aztec that Wilhelm von Humboldt pre­
sented 1 50 years ago ( Humboldt 1836) . In essence, the claim is that the
pronominal affixes actually fill the argument positions of the verb and
that any noun phrases filling what seem to be the core argument posi­
tions of the verb are actually only indirectly linked to it, by being in ap­
position to a pronominal affix which bears the same noun class, person,
and number specifications as the noun phrase. Consider some examples:
( 5-65 ) a. kacmpt
payum
ya-mpu-yamal-wat
canoe VIII PL man I PL VIII PL 0-3PL A-carve-HAB
'The men usually carve the canoes. '
b . lJaykum
panmal
makaw
woman II PL fish ( sp) IX SG man I SG
wa-mpu-lJa-r-akn
IX SG T-3PL A-give-PERF-3SG D
'The women gave the man makau. '
The verb yamal 'carve' i s a simple transitive verb with two core argu­
ments, A and 0. The prefixes to the verb identify the A as third person
singular and the 0 as class VIII plural. As pointed out earlier, the A
prefixes do not normally distinguish noun class and are almost always
restricted to human nouns, or at least higher animates. Now the process­
ing task is to search for the noun phrases which have the same person,
number and class specifications as the verbal prefixes, so as to fill out the
interpretation of the clause. The class VIII plural noun kacmpt 'canoes'
has the same class and number specifications as the 0 prefix ya- VIII
PL; the nominal is therefore integrated with the prefix and interpreted
as carrying the 0 role. The human plural class I noun payum 'men' has
the same number specifications as the A prefix mpu- 3PL A. Being hu­
man, it is a potential A, unlike the other noun, and hence is interpreted
with the role of A in the clause. The two nouns are not themselves filling
argument positions in the verb; those are simply the pronominal affixes.
The nouns are, however, linked to these affixes by virtue of having the
same category specifications and through this indirect route are inter­
preted as having the same participant roles. The word order of the noun
phrases is free and plays no role in their interpretation.
Example ( 5-65b) is similar, but in this case the verb is ditransitive.
Its affixes indicate a class IX singular T ( wa- ) , a third plural A ( mpu-)
and a third singular D (- nakn) . The singular class IX noun makaw 'fish
( sp) ' is clearly linked to wa- and thereby receives the theme interpreta­
tion. The other two nouns, the class II plural vaykum 'women' and the
class I singular panmal 'man' are both human and hence both potentially
A and D. But the number contrast here is sufficient to disambiguate.","[248, 249, 250]"
"NEIGHBORING LANGUAGES9Southwest of Yimas in the foothills of the central highlands is spoken
the lniai dialect of the Enga language, which in terms of speakers, is the
largest of Papuan languages. This belongs to the Engan language family
and is in most respects typical of the languages of highland New Guinea.
One respect in which Enga diverges from other highland languages, how­
ever, is in the presence of palatal consonants, otherwise uncommon in
the languages of the central highlands. In fact, like Yimas, Enga pos­
sesses a palatalized liquid and a voiceless palatal stop with the usual
allophone [s]. This reflects areal diffusion of a palatal series among the
unrelated languages of the area. Palatals are well established in Enga
and appear to have been inherited from Proto-Engan (Franklin 1975).
Enga contrasts with both Yimas and Arafundi in that it has a voiced
series of stops (including one in the palatal position), which are always
prenasalized. In Yimas such sequences are best analyzed as nasal plus
stop clusters, but in Enga they are unit phonemes. Enga also lacks
the high central vowel so characteristic of Sepik languages generally and
Yimas in particular. Rather it has the standard five-vowel system of
highlands languages.
Morphologically, Enga fits the general highlands pattern. As in Ara­
fundi, nouns are not inflected for gender or number, but they are in­
flected for case, and rather richly so: Enga has seven distinct case suf­
fixes, including an ergative. One area is which Enga does parallel Yimas
is in the marking of a possessor. Both languages use a remarkably sim­
ilar form: Yimas na, Enga - nya. Enga verbs are like those of Arafundi
and contrast with those of Yimas in that they are nearly exclusively
suffixing (there is only one prefix, the negative, in the entire language).
Verbal suffixes in Enga mark tense and the person and number of the
subject, but unlike the situation in Arafundi, there is no object suffix.
A further feature shared with Arafundi is that the subject suffixes do
not distinguish between second- and third-person in the non-singular
numbers. While there is some variation in form of the subject suffixes
due to tense variation, they clearly are all derived from a single form
(Lang 1973) ( l-e-6 say-FR PAST-1SG S 'I said long ago', lli-p-u say-NR
PAST-1SG S 'I said', le-ly-o say-PRES-1SG S 'I am saying'). Finally,
Enga makes heavy use of morphologically distinct dependent verb forms
and switch-reference morphology (Lang 1973).

"416INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSAs with the evidence from the modally inflected verbs, the anomaly
of -nak 3SG 0 illustrates a nominative-accusative bias in this part of
Yimas grammar. Note that, when relativized, S and A participants
of these specific class and number features are coded alike, with 0
-n, while 0 participants are treated differently, requiring - nak. The
following examples make this very clear:
(7-83) a. namarawt [m-na-taw-n-0
mnti]
person I SG NR DIST-DEF-sit-PRES-3SG there
'the person who is sitting there'
b. namarawt [narmaJJ

c. namarawt [narmaJJ
m-n-tpul-c-ak]
person I SG woman II SG NR DIST-3SG A-hit-PERF-3SG 0
'the person whom the woman hit'
It is difficult to explain the reason for this form. It cannot be to eliminate
ambiguity, for the obligatory absence of any third person pronominal
prefixes in A relativization versus their presence in 0 relativization is
sufficient to accomplish this. Further this is exactly how disambiguation
is accomplished in the dual and plural which use the same concord suffix
regardless of the participant role of the relativized noun.

Relativization of the T argument of a ditransitive verb is simplest
if the D participant is first or second person and hence marked by a
pronominal prefix. Then, the concord suffix for the relativized T noun
simply follows the tense suffix.

If the D is third person and thus a suffix, the concord suffix for the
relativized T follows it, causing the D suffix to appear in its non-word­
final form.

Relativization of D participants presents a special problem. The
m- NR DIST stem always occupies one of the verbal pronominal pre­
fix positions potentially usurping the position for the prefix for the T
participant. The pronominal affixes for third person D participants are
suffixes following the tense suffix, and this is the position for the con­
cord suffix marking the class and number features of the noun modified
by the relative clause. Both of these present morphological difficulties
for relativization of D participants, and this is generally avoided in the
language. I have never encountered an example in spontaneous usage,
but in elicitation sessions I have been able to get speakers to produce
examples like the following, although given the context in which they
were obtained, it is probable that they are fairly stilted.

'The boy that the women gave food to is crying in the house.'
The relative clause in (7-87) has no unambiguous concord suffix nor m­
NR DIST. The verbal pronominal suffix in this example does double418INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSduty as both the relative clause concord marker and the affix for a third
person singular D participant. The stem m- NR DIST is completely
prohibited because of ya- V PL T. In fact, the modified noun plus the
relative clause looks like a main clause, and (7-87) is ambiguous between
a construction with a relative clause and one consisting of two conjoined
clauses with the meaning 'The women gave the food to the boy in the
house and he is crying.' What, in fact, can discriminate between these
two are word order constraints. If the first clause is simply one of two
conjoined clauses, then kalakn 'boy' can occur anywhere within it, say
between vaykum 'women' and amtra 'food'. If, however, it is the ex­
ternal modified noun of a relative clause, this is not possible. It must
always occur outside of the relative clause, either before it, as in (7-87),
or after it.
Yimas does not restrict relativization to core arguments only. The
language allows relative clauses to be formed by relativizing locationals
(and temporals, as well, but these will be discussed in Section 7.2.3).
When a locational is relativized, the clause describes the place at which
an event occurs, but locative relative clauses contrast with those formed
for core arguments in that they never permit a true head noun, al­
though a locational word or deictic may be present, as following exam­
ples illustrate:

NR DIST-3PL A-cut skin-HAB-IX SG-OBL
'up there where they cut their skin'
The relative clause in the (a) example can only be construed as modify­
ing mnti 'there', but the class-number concord marker on the verb is - a
IX SG. This is the typical class-number marker for referring to places or
areas and may reflect a now lost noun referring to this concept (much
as - mpwi 'talk' and - nti 'act' probably do) . This may be related to
the prefix ta- found on the other locational deictics ta-k 'here' and ta-n
'there' or even more likely to the interrogative stem -vka 'where', both
of which end in -a and on phonological grounds are plausible members
of class IX. In any case, the relative clause is marked as modifying aFINITE NOMINALIZATIONS419class IX singular noun which clearly cannot be the locational deictic.
Rather we must assume some obligatorily missing noun of this class and
number specification which, in turn, is in apposition to the deictic. Sim­
ilar remarks apply to ( 7-88b), with the locational word mawn 'above'.
Sometimes there is not even a deictic or locational word to act as a stand
in head for a locative relative clause; they simply occur on their own as
in (7-89):

Negative finite relative clauses are formed in the same way that
tensed clauses generally are negated, with the verbal prefix ta- NEG
(this obligatorily replaces m- NR DIST). In relative clauses, however,
ta- creates some problems because the morphological effect of negation
on a verb is very much like that of relativization: both require par­
ticipants normally coded by pronominal prefixes to appear as suffixes.
This can result in negative relative clauses being ambiguous (note that
the same result obtains with negation by -kakan 'without' used with
non-finite relative clauses).

'the person that did
not hit the woman.'
The suffix -nak 3SG 0 could be either the result of negation or relative
clause formation. If the latter, it would identify the relativized noun as
in 0 function and thus require the first of the two possible readings. This
is, in fact, the preferred reading. If - nak 3SG 0 derives from negation,
then no conclusions are possible concerning the role of the relativized
noun and the relative clause is therefore compatible with a reading of it
being the A participant (the seeond meaning above). The only way to{}420INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSforce a reading of the A as being the relativized noun is not to code the
0 by a verbal affix at all.
(7-91) namarawt [narma!J
ta-pu-tpul-0]

'the person who hit the woman'
Here the bivalent verb tpul- 'hit' is formally intransitive, with just a
single participant coded by pu- . . .-0. The fact that the concord suffix on
the verb is 0 rather than - nak indicates that the relativized noun must
be A. Hence, this example is not ambiguous.
The placement of a relative clause (finite or non-finite) with respect
to its 'head' noun is free. It can precede the 'head' noun,

ative clauses normally function to provide definite descriptions for an en­
tity just being introduced in order to help the hearer identify it. To pro­
vide the definite description but omit the noun to which it applies is prag­
matically very odd and requires quite a marked context to be acceptable.
Example (7-95) belongs in a narrative context discussing crocodiles,
where the entity described by the relative clause is already well es­
tablished. The relative clause then functions contrastively, to select a
particular set of crocodiles out of the class which is already the topic.
The freedom of movement of relative clauses and their very weak
links to their 'head' nouns is fully in keeping with the analysis adopted
here that they are independent nominals in their own right, but appo­
sitionally linked to their head. Unlike other nominals, though, finite rel­
ative clauses are full clauses and partake of the grammatical features of
clauses. As discussed in Section 6.5, Yimas clauses are very loosely struc­
tured, with nominals (core and oblique) occurring in any order with re­
spect to the verb. Structurally, a Yimas clause is flat, with the verb and
nominal clauses all on the same level, as first order branches of S. Rel­
ative clauses have the same basic structure, and are just as free in their
word order possibilities. Thus, (7-96a,b) are both fully grammatical.

Relative clauses can assume any function in the main clause: core
arguments, obliques, or even constituents of possessive NPs. Most com­
monly they are linked to 'head' nouns in these functions and thus assume
the same functions, although the 'heads' can be missing, with the rela­
tive clauses bearing these functions on their own. Examples of relative

Note that in both of these examples, the relative clause follows the non­
finite verb ( it is possible for them to precede ) .
The above facts clearly demonstrate that finite relative clauses have
all the syntactic features and privileges of nouns, including class and
number, but at the same time remain full finite clauses, with tense real­
ized on the verb. They must be analyzed in the most basic terms as an
N realized as a clause. There are two morphological exponents of these
nominal features-m- NR DIST and the final concord suffixes-and so
the question arises as to which of these is the head of the construction,
i.e., that morpheme which actually makes the sentential constituent into
a noun phrase. This would be difficult to decide if it was not for one
small piece of evidence, and that is the concord suffix - nak 3SG 0. This
actually codes the function of the relativized noun, which is a clause­
internal constituent, not that of any constituent in the main clause.
Thus, its behavior is like that of a verbal pronominal affix within the
relative clause. This leaves m- NR. DIST to assume the function of theINTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS424head of the relative clause, and suggests a more formal structure like the
following:
(7-99)NP---- ---N
S
I
/ ""'-.
mX
PRONR DIST--This structure is anomalous in having its head on the left, because Vi­
mas otherwise is a consistent head to the right language. However, this
discrepancy must be faced with the deictics generally; consider the fol­
lowing deictic forms for class I SG:
na-n
m-n
(7-100) na-k
I SG-FR DIST
NR DIST-I SG
I SG-PROX
'that near you'
'that yonder'
'this'
Regardless of whether we choose the concord suffix or the deictic stem
as the head in these forms, at least one form will be anomalous. Sticking
to the majority head to the right pattern of Yimas, we can analyze the
proximal and far deictic forms as consisting of modifier + head, with the
head being the deictic stem. Applying this then to the near distal form,
we identify m- NR DIST as its head. This is unusual because the head
is on the left, but it does independently vindicate the structure (7-100)
suggested for relative clauses.
The stem m- NR DIST is not equivalent to the head noun of an
English relative clause such as the man who killed the crocodile. It is
equivalent rather to the main clause noun to which the relative clause
as a whole is paratactically linked.
Consider the structure of example (7-97a) , which is diagrammed
below in (7-101). Because m- is a form bound to the verb, noun ar­
guments of the relative clause occur before it, represented by the line
branching from the S of the relative clause and crossing over the ver­
tical line from the N of the relative clause. The concord suffix on the
verb of the relative clause marks the class and number (and the par­
ticipant role) of the relativized noun. These features are transferred
to m- NR DIST, much as - m on English who-m identifies that the
relativized noun is an object. Since m- NR DIST is the head of the
noun phrase, these features are also those of the noun phrase as a
whole. These finally are matched up to the features of the noun kaywi
'girl' which is thereby established as the noun modified by the relative
clause.","[437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446]"
"202BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYIf the combination of participants is third singular A and second singular
0, the prefix na- functioning as A may be optionally deleted, resulting
in homophony with (5-16b) and a further ambiguity.
(5-18) a. na-nan-tay
3SG A-2SG O-see
'He saw you.'
b. 0-nan-tay
3SG A-2SG O-see
'He saw you.'
c. na-n-tay = (5-16b)
3SG 0-2/3SG A-see
'You/he saw him.'
I should point out that there are ways to disambiguate most of these
forms either by the use of independent pronouns or by nominalizing
them. See the discussion of finite nominalizations in Section 7.2.
It is now necessary to turn to the major principles which determine
the linear order of the A and 0 prefixes on transitive verbs. There are
two, sometimes conflicting, principles involved here. The first is a person
hierarchy in which first person outranks second which outranks third.
The second is a role hierarchy which states that for first and second
persons 0 outranks A, but for third person, A outranks 0.
Let us start with the simplest case, a verb with two third person
participants. In such a case, the first principle is irrelevant, for there
is no difference in person. Because both participants are third person,
by the second principle the higher ranked prefix will be the A. Rank is
indicated in the Yimas verb by a position to the right, closer to the verb
stem. Thus, for a verb with two third person participants, the 0 will
occur first and be followed by the higher ranked A, as in these examples:
(5-19) a. pu-n-tay
3PL 0-3SG A-see
'He saw them. '
b. na-mpi-tay
3SG A-3DL A-see
'They two saw him.'
In (5-19a) the A is third singular and the 0 third plural, so the prefixes
must occur in the order 0-A or pu-n- 3PL 0-3SG A. Similarly, in (5-19b)
there is a third dual A and a third singular 0, and again the prefixes
must occur in the order 0-A or na-mpi- 3SG 0-3DL A.
So far, all third person participants we have considered have referred
to humans, that is, members of noun classes I and II. One may have
in fact noted that the S/0 prefixes given for third person correspondTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR C ORE NOMINALS203to the verbal agreement prefixes for classes I and II. These two are in
fact one and the same. But the vast majority of potential third person
participants, the nouns of Yimas, refer to animals, plants or inanimate
objects. These too may be marked on the verb by the corresponding
verbal prefixes for noun classes given in Chapter 4. Like the prefixes
for classes I and II, these verbal prefixes are the forms used to mark S
and 0.

b. tampaym

'I hung up the food hanger. '
(5-20a) contains an intransitive verb for which tampaym 'food hanger'
functions as the S nominal and is marked on the verb by the correspond­
ing class VII verbal prefix p-. (5-20b) illustrates the corresponding tran­
sitive verb for which the same nominal now functions as the 0 argument,
but again it is indicated by the prefix p-. Thus, these verbal prefixes for
noun classes exhibit the same ergative-absolutive pattern found through­
out the forms for third person. Examples from other classes follow:
(5-21) a. wut ura-na-irm-kia-k

'It's getting dark.'

'I sharpened the knife.'
c. mura!Jkl kla-ka-yamal
paddle VI DL VI DL 0- lSG A-carve
'I carved the two paddles.'
Only occasionally can an inanimate noun be referenced by an A pre­
fix. The A prefixes have no differentiation for noun class: all nouns
regardless of noun class are indicated by one of the three A prefixes for
t hird person given above. Inanimate nouns may be expressed by an A
prefix if they are associated with a transitive verb indicating a change of
state or location, and they function as the force or instrument causing
the change. For example:

'The machete cut them.'","[223, 224, 225]"
"4Nouns and Noun PhrasesNominals are those words which can stand on their own as referring
expressions. Besides nouns, other word classes which can function as
nominals are adjectives, quantifiers, some temporals, pronouns, and de­
ictics. A general morphological feature of nominals is specification for
number and noun class. These are inherent to each common noun, but
are assigned to other nominal types according to the noun they modify
or refer to. Because number and class are inherent features of common
nouns, and only acquired features of other nominal types, it is best to
organize the study of these features around the various classes of nouns.
The number inflection of nouns varies with class, so these two features
will be treated together. Yimas also has a set of proper nouns, which
function as names for people and places. These are never assigned to
any noun class and are not inflectable for number.
4.1 Noun Classes
Yimas has ten basic noun classes with a reasonably large number of
members and a half dozen or so minor classes with a single member
each. The basic noun classes are of two types: those with a semantic
basis for the assignment of members to the class, and those for which
the assignment is strictly phonological. There is one class that combines
both of these features. The assignment of nouns to classes is determined
by the system of adjectival agreement: all nouns with the same set of
agreement suffixes for adjectives belong to the same noun class, and any
noun with a different set · belongs to another noun class.
4.1.1 Class I
This class includes male humans and human beings whose sex is not
highlighted. It is therefore the unmarked class for human beings. Many
119NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES120of the nouns in this class show great irregularity and suppletion in their
formation of plurals. The dual is normally formed from the singular
by suffixing -rm, although there are some irregularities among its allo­
morphs. Consider the following examples of nouns from class I:

wuntumalJ
wuntumaJJkat 'mask carving'
wuntumaJJtrm
From these examples it can be seen that there is no distinctive mark
for the singular in class I, but that the dual, with the exception of
'son, child', is marked by the suffix -rm, added to the singular forms,
which function as the stems. However, only in the stems ending in /k/,
'father-in-law' and 'father's sister's husband' , is the formation simply
the stem plus the dual suffix -rm. All other stems, except those ending
in t (underlying /r/), require an intrusive /t/ between the stem and
the dual suffix, which is then subject to palatalization (rule (2-3)) if the
stem ends in a segment with F.
matn + -rm > matntrm
'brothers (DL)'
away + -rm > awaytrm > awacrm 'mother's brothers (DL)'
The second example can be represented diagrammatically as follows:NOUN CLASSES

Palatalization will not shift further to the right to effect lrI, as rule (2-3)
is specified in such a way so as to only affect [-peripheral] segments. lrl
is not specified for peripherality (see Table 3). All palatalized liquids
(i.e., Ill), are underlying, not derived. We can propose the following
rule to handle these cases of ltl epenthesis:
( 4-1) It I-epenthesis
0 -+ t l - + rm
{DL}
This rule will not apply if the stem ends in lkl or ltl. Finally, stems
ending in Ill as well as a few other sporadic cases (e.g., 'ceremonial
companion') add an epenthetic lnl as well.
takul + -rm > takulntrm > takulJlcrm 'brother-in-law'
'ceremonial companions'
yanaw + -rm > yanawntrm
This rule can be stated as follows:
( 4-2) lnl-epenthesis
0 -+ n l - + t + rm
{DL}
As we shall see later in the forms for classes III and V, both rule ( 4-1 )
and rule ( 4-2) are frequently encountered in Yimas. (Both rules can
apply to form optional variants of all class I nouns; thus, an alternative
dual form for apuk 'father's sister's husband' is apukntrm.)
The plurals of class I are much more complicated than the duals. A
number of forms, 'person', 'man', 'son, child', 'mother's brother', 'sister'sNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES122son', have suppletive forms for the plural stems. In addition, there are
three basic forms for the plural endings for class I nouns, grouped as
follows:
-t forms
- (uk)at
- (n)tt-m forms
-am
-urn-i form
-iIt is clearly impossible to collapse all of these allomorphs under a sin­
gle underlying form. Rather, we must recognize both morphologically
conditioned (i.e. , stem conditioned) allomorphs and phonologically con­
ditioned ones. That the former are absolutely necessary is established by
away 'mother's brother', PL: vawapct; but akay 'grandparent, grand­
son', PL: akayam. Clearly, there is no phonological conditioning which
could account for this contrast, and the proper plural allomorphs must
be entered lexically, as morphologically conditioned. Other allomorphic
choices are conditioned phonologically. For example, -i is the plural al­
lomorph following the peripheral stops fpf and /k/ (the jw / is provided
by the spreading of rounding from the previous syllable) .","[139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"

In both the examples in (7-10), the /r/ of - ru would appear as t if it were
not for the adjoining high front vowel. This simply causes palatalization
of t to c. Note that, unusually, palatalization does not spread rightward
in the first example from c to the adjoining n and t.
There are other cases in which the /r/ appears as c without benefit
of an intermediate stage t , for in these examples, if it were not for the
presence of a segment with the F autosegment, the r would remain
unchanged.

Note that in this last example, the general rule of unstressed fu/ deletion
is blocked. The morpheme specific rule for - ru NFN converting /r/ to
c after a segment associated with F takes precedence and after it has
applied, the environment for the general rule no longer exists.
The final variation to mention for the segment /r/ in -ru is in verb
plus noun compounds. In these constructions it is invariably realized
simply as t.

'spears for killing enemies'
The suffix -ru NFN is used as the basic derivational suffix in all sorts
of nominalization constructions. These are very common in Yimas, for
they correspond to the general embedded or complement constructions
of other languages. Perhaps the most straightforward kind of nomi­
nalization is agentive nominalization, equivalent to English - er. There
are seven different morphemes to indicate agentive nominalizations in
Yimas, a distinct masculine and feminine form for each of the threeNON-FINITE N OMINALIZATIONS381numbers, singular, dual and plural, and a paucal form, undifferentiated
for gender, as in the following:
M
F
-ma!J
SG -awt
DL
-mampan
-mprump
PC
-JJ�
-nput
PL -mat
With the exception of - awt M SG and - mat M PL, these forms are closely
related to the adjectival concord suffixes for classes I and II. Forms with
these suffixes are all subject to the phonological rules discussed above:
in addition, the /u/ of - ru NFN regularly deletes before -vkt PC.
(7-14) fampa-ru-JJkt/ > amparvkt
'a few weavers'
weave-NFN-PC
The feminine suffixes for agentive nominalizations are only used in the
non-singular to refer to groups which are exclusively female: mixed
groups are denoted by the masculine suffixes. The masculine forms
are also used for animals and inanimate objects. Examples of agentive
nominalizations follow:
(7-15) a. kpanti-pramuJJ-tu-mat
big-sleep-NFN-M PL
'people who sleep too much'
b. irut
ampa-r-ma!J
mat IX PL weave-NFN-F SG

c. pacuk-r-awt

VIS-feel-NFN-F DL
'the two women that look after (the children)'
e. namtamparawt-Jlan api-c-awt
foot IX DL-OBL
put in-NFN-M SG
'a sock'
These agentive nominalizations always carry a habitual meaning: they
denote an object or person (or group of people) which typically per­
forms the action of the nominalized verb root. This habitual or typical
meaning is readily apparent in all of the above examples, but perhaps
especially clear are (7-15a,e). If one wishes to form an agentive nominal­
ization to express a non-habitual performer of an action, a finite relative
clause must be used (see Section 7.2.1). Note that agentive nominal-382INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSizations in Yimas are commonly associated with nouns or adverbials,
much like those of English: dishwash-er, story tell-er, hard work-er. In
both languages such nouns may never function as A participants, but are
typically 0 or T arguments. The last example (7-15e) with the oblique
suffix -n ""' -nan, illustrates an agentive nominalization that has actu­
ally been realized as the head noun of a noun plus noun compound (see
Section 4.4), much like English blackboard erase-r. As with English dish­
washer versus dish maker, the boundary in Yimas between compounds
and agentive nominalizations is rather fuzzy.
These suffixes have a number of other uses besides marking agentive
nominalizations. Some of these involve subordinate clauses and will be
discussed in the relevant sections on relative clauses (see Section 7.2.1)
and temporal adverbial clauses (see Section 7.2.3); here I will confine
myself to word-level uses. These suffixes can be added to locative words
with or without the oblique suffix -n ""' -nan to express a person or
people associated with that place.

indicate the inhabitants of that area.

These suffixes are also added to a stem pan- (of no separate meaning,NON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS383but probably related to panmal 'man'), to derive contrastive pronouns
'myself', 'yourself', 'himself', 'themselves', etc. Consider these examples:
(7-18) a. ama pan-awt na-ka-tu-t

'I killed him myself.'

c. m-n
pan-awt-mpwia ""ama paympan
NR DIST-1 SG self-M SG-QUOTE 1SG eagle
tampan""
NEG COP
'He himself said ""I am not an eagle."" '
These contrastive pronouns sometimes occur with the oblique suffix but
with no apparent difference in usage or meaning. Compare (7-19) below
with (7-18a):
(7-19) m-n
pan-awt-jlan trmantak
NR DIST-1 SG self-M SG-OBL spear V SG
na-n-awkura-ntut
V SG 0-3SG A-get-RM PAST
'He got a spear himself.'
These pronoun forms are contrastive in that they indicate that the per­
former of the action is exhaustively defined by their referent, i.e., 'it is
they and no one else who X-ed'. Thus these forms always denote agen­
tive participants. This explains to a certain extent their morphological
formation. The suffixes - awt M SG, etc., are of course most commonly
used to derive agentive nominalizations. Because of the meaning of pan-,
it varies between a purely contrastive and a reflexive usage. Consider
these examples:
(7-20) a. m-n
pan-awt na-n-tu-t
NR DIST-1 SG self-M SG 3SG 0-3SG A-kill-PERF

*'He killed him himself.'","[401, 402, 403, 404, 405]"
"INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS412suffix on the main verb. This is typical of negative oblique clauses. The
non-finite oblique clauses are within the same time frame as the main
clause and express events whose non-occurrence right now is responsible
for the circumstances holding in the main clause. Thus, in (7-75a) the
speaker's decision not to return is contingent on whether the women
come or not. If they do not come, the situation of the main clause will
eventuate. Similar remarks apply to (7-75c ). The middle example (775b) is perhaps the most interesting. The failure of the plane to arrive
will leave the speaker and his group without food. This situation is thus
summed up in the query which forms the main clause, 'what do we eat?'.
An interesting difference between positive and negative non-finite
oblique clauses concerns word order possibilities. While core arguments
of positive non-finite oblique clauses can occur after the verb, as exam­
ples (7-70b,e) demonstrate, this is not possible with negative non-finite
oblique clauses. So (7-76) is ungrammatical.

This may indicate that -kakan 'without', like kantk 'with', is a postpo­
sition and governs an NP constituent preceding, blocking any possible
extraction from it.
-7.2 Finite NominalizationsFinite nominalizations contrast with non-finite ones in that they require
a tense suffix and never take -ru NFN. Pronominal affixes may also occur
on verbs in finite nominalizations. Another typical morphological feature
of finite nominalizations, albeit not a universal one, is the near distal
deictic stem m-. The verbs of finite nominalizations commonly occur
suffixed to this stem, replacing the normal class and number concord
suffixes, with the whole forming a complex nominal not unlike m-n NR
DIST-1 SG 'he'. The use of distal deictics to mark relative clauses is
common in Papuan languages (Reesink 1987; Olson 1981) and elsewhere
(note English that). In most languages, this occurs at the boundary of
the relative clause, but in Yimas it is a form bound, like a prefix, to the
inflected verb of the relative clause. This again reflects the polysynthetic
nature of the language; a relative clause will commonly consist of nothing
but a fully inflected verb, suffixed to m- NR DIST. A clause is again
realized as a word-level unit. Finite nominalizations have a similar range
of functions to their non-finite counterparts, except that they are neverFINITE NOMINALIZATIONS413used as complements. Their most common functions are as relative and
oblique (i.e., adverbial) clauses.
7.2.1 Finite Relative Clauses
Finite relative clauses are not an infrequent feature of Yimas discourse.
The verbs in finite relative clauses share a good deal in their morpho­
logical formation with modally inflected verbs, the discussion of which
the reader may care to review (see Section 5.2.2). Finite relative clauses
are typically marked by m- NR DIST, to which the fully inflected verb
is suffixed. (There is a sub-type of finite relative clauses which does not
employ m- NR DIST, and this will be discussed in detail later in this
section.) The stem m- NR DIST functions much like the wh word or
that in English-to mark the whole relative clause as a definite referring
expression. The other obligatory morpheme marking a finite relative is
a class and number concord suffix. These are the adjectival concord suf­
fixes for the various noun classes and occur as the final suffix of the verb,
except that human nouns do not distinguish class, i.e., masculine and
feminine nouns take the same set of suffixes, those found with modally
inflected verbs (see Section 5.2.2).

The suffix -'T)k VI SG (-1) in word final position) occurs on each of the
verbs in these relative clauses, marking the class and number of these
nominalizations and hence indicating what noun is modified by them,
i.e., what are their head nouns. The same class and number concord
suffix is used regardless of the participant role of the relativized noun: S
in (7-77a), 0 in (7-77b), and A in (7-77c). This is typical of lower animate
and inanimate nouns, but higher animate and especially human nouns
are more complicated. It will be necessary to discuss relativization on
the differing participant role types separately.
The basic rule is that the noun which is being relativized is marked
only once, by the final class and number concord suffix. The relativized
noun may be defined as the noun coreferential to the 'head', but obli­
gatorily absent in the relative clause. Thus, in all three examples in414INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS(7-77) the relativized noun is krayv 'frog', the same as the 'head', but
it is obligatorily absent in these relative clauses and only traced by the
concord suffix agreeing with it in number and class. Relative clauses in
which the relativized noun functions as S are the simplest case, so let's
start there. The only agreement suffix permitted on a verb in a relative
clause with the S as the relativized noun is the final concord suffix; the
S cannot be also coded by a pronominal prefix. Consider these:
(7-78) a. namarawt [m-ya-t-0]
person I SG NR DIST-come-PERF-3SG
b.*namarawt [m-n-ya-t-0]
person I SG NR DIST-3SG S-come-PERF-3SG
'the person who came'
The relativized noun in both of these is the S participant, namarawt
'person'. This is, of course, the same as the head noun, and is marked
by the concord suffix 0. (Human singular nouns and singular nouns of
classes III and V are irregular in that instead of the expected concord
suffix -n, a zero morpheme is found. This is parallel to the usage with
modally inflected verbs.) Example (7-78b) is ungrammatical because
the S is coded twice on the verb, once by the concord suffix and also
by the pronominal agreement prefix n- 3SG S. The latter is completely
prohibited by the blanket rule against double marking of the relativized
noun.
When the relativized noun is an A argument, the resulting structure
is similar to that with relativization on an S. The verb can contain
pronominal agreement prefixes in addition to the obligatory concord
suffix, but these must code an 0 or D participant, never the A. The
morphology for marking a relativized A is identical to that for S.

person is first or second: third person prefixes are prohibited. So (7-80a)
is grammatical, but (7-80b) is not.
(7-80) a. namat
[m-JJa-tpul-c-um]

'the people who hit me'
[m-pu-tpul-c-um]
b.*namat
person I PL NR DIST-3PL O-hit-PERF-3PL
'the people who hit them'
The reason for this restriction is probably to eliminate ambiguity. Be­
cause the third person pronominal prefixes do not actually distinguish
participant roles as do those of the first and second persons, but vary
in form according to their word position, a form like (7-80b) would be
ambiguous as to whether pu- codes A or 0. In fact, a string like (7-80b)
can only have the meaning where pu- functions as the A.
When the relativized noun is 0, pronominal agreement prefixes of any
person are permitted on the verb to code the A participant. Consider
these examples:
(7-81) a. napntuk [m-kay-JlanaJJ-tmi-aw!Jkcpa-ntuk-ulJ]

NR DIST-3DL A-DUR-pound sago-RM PAST-IV PL
'the sago palms which they both were pounding'
Singular human nouns (and nouns of class III and V which behave
morpho- logically like them) have a special concord suffix - nak used
when the relativized noun is in 0 function.
(7-82) a. [Macprak m-n-wu-ntuk-nak]

m-mpu-tu-r-ak]

b. wakn

'the snake which the people killed'
This is the only concord suffix for relative clauses that actually codes the
participant role of the relativized noun. All others are oblivious to this.","[433, 434, 435, 436, 437]"

Other quantifiers in Yimas besides numerals are mpatnpa- 'few.' and
muntak 'many, all'. muntak is invariable, but mpatnpa- varies according
to the noun class of the modified noun by suffixing the plural adjectival
number/class suffixes ( tanpat mpatnpa-ra 'a few bones'). There is also
the interrogative quantifier ntuknti 'how much, how many', which is also
invariable.
3.5 Locationals
Locationals are words which describe the location of an object with re­
spect to that of another object or the speech event. In Yimas there are
two types of locationals: free locationals, corresponding to English lo­
cational adverbs, and locational postpositions, corresponding to English
locational prepositions. Locationals end in n, undoubtedly a fossilized
occurrence of the oblique suffix - n ""' -nan.
Free locationals never occur in the postpositional phrase construction
consisting of a noun plus postposition that is diagnostic of locational
postpositions. Free locationals normally occur as independent words in
a sentence, modifying the copula or a positional verb. Examples of free
locationals are given below:'far'
'near'
'alone'kwantayn
warpayn
tantukwan'left'
'right'pay!Jkan
ampanExamples of their usage are:
(3-23) a. num kwantayn numa-na-pay-n
village far
village S-DEF-lie-PRES
'The village is far.'
warpayn na-na-irm-n
b. taki
stone V SG near
IV SG S-DEF-stand-PRES
'The stone is near.'
While these stems semantically modify nouns, they are not adjectives.
They may never occur with the typical adjectival number/class suffixes,
nor may they precede the head noun in a tightly knit noun phrase.
Closely related in form and behavior to these free locationals and not
too dissimilar in meaning is pawin 'plain, naked, unadorned'. This too
ends in n and occurs as an independent word, modifying a verb. Note
the exact parallelism in these two examples:106WORD CLASSES(3-24) a. panmal tantukwan na-na-aw!Jkcpa-n
man-I SG alone
3SG S-DEF-bathe-PRES
'The man is bathing alone.'
b. panmal pawin na-na-aw!Jkcpa-n
man-I SG naked 3SG S-DEF-bathe-PRES
'The man is bathing naked. '
The stems tantukwan and pawin are not adjectives because they may
never be inflected with the adjectival class/number suffixes. Pawin, but
not tantukwan, does, however, possess one distinctive feature of true
adjectives: it may form a close-knit noun phrase with a following noun,
e.g. , pawin tpuk 'plain sago pancake', 'sago pancake with no meat or
embellishments'. Pawin seems to be a stem intermediate in behavior
between the word classes true adjective and free locational. Its form
and most of its grammatical behavior mark it as a free locational, but
its occurrence in noun phrases indicate that it is a true adjective. Given
that along its full range of meaning, pawin denotes qualities, it is not
surprising that it would take on some adjectival features. A plausible
scenario for the development of pawin would be starting out as a free
locational and gradually being reanalyzed as a member of the adjective
class. It is now in an intermediate stage. Although tantukwan 'alone'
would also seem to English speakers to denote a quality, it is also fairly
easy to see its locational meaning, i.e., something is in a location without
anyone/anything else. This word so far has resisted any move toward
reanalysis as an adjective, as in * tantukwan panmal 'alone man'. Rather
one must say
(3-25) panmal
tantukwan na-na-pay/taw/irm/-n
man I SG alone
3SG S-DEF-lie/sit/stand-PRES
'The man is alone. '
Locational postpositions contrast with free locationals in not always
being independent words. They most commonly occur as postpositions
. to a noun or noun phrase, and in these constructions they require the
noun to be inflected with oblique case suffix -n ""' -nan.

"10THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSTo the west of Yimas along the upper reaches of the Karawari river
and along the Wagupmeri river, lies the Alamblak language, spoken by
about 1200 people in a dozen villages. This is the easternmost language
of the Sepik Hill family, stretching away to the west to the West Sepik
provincial border and the south to the Southern Highlands provincial
border. This family is composed of 14 languages and is quite possibly
related to the languages of the middle Sepik area, such as the Ndu lan­
guages, Iatmul and Abelam. The evidence for this is merely suggestive,
however, and any conclusive proof of genetic relationship remains to be
produced.
Alamblak has exactly the same three-height vowel system as Ara­
fundi, but is phonetically very similar to Yimas in the heavy prepon­
derance of the epenthetic high central vowel. It also parallels Yimas in
the relatively recent appearance of the palatal series and in having a
productive synchronic rule of palatalization. It contrasts with Yimas,
Arafundi, and Enga in having a somewhat richer inventory of fricatives,
including those at the bilabial and velar positions. A further difference
from Yimas and Arafundi is the presence of a distinctive voiced stop
series, which, contra Enga, is not prenasalized.
Morphologically, Alamblak is most like Yimas, in spite of the lack of
any genetic affiliation. This seems to be the result of extensive diffusion
of structural traits over the centuries, which probably also accounts for
some of the phonological similarities. It must be emphasized that Yi­
mas and Alamblak share traits of general morphological structure; they
do not share any actual morphological cognates. Alamblak nouns are
inflected for gender and number. There is a three-way number distinc­
tion and a two-way gender distinction between masculine and feminine.
Gender in Alamblak is determined by biological sex or shape: long thin
objects are masculine and short squat objects are feminine. There is no
neutralization of person distinctions in the non-singular numbers, as in
Arafundi and Enga. Nouns functioning in core roles like subject and
object are not inflected for case, but there is a rather rich array of case
suffixes for oblique functions like instrumentals or locatives. Verbs are
again largely suffixing (in contrast to prefixing Yimas), the main pre­
fixes being those marking mood, like imperative and hortative. The
main suffixes are for tense, subject agreement and object agreement, in
that order. This contrasts with Arafundi, in which the object agreement
suffix precedes the tense suffix which in turn is followed by the subject
agreement morpheme. Like Yimas and Enga, Alamblak has a rich tense
system, distinguishing a number of past tenses according to the number
of days removed from today. The subject and object agreement suffixes
encode person and number, and for third-person singular, they encodeETHNOGRAPHIC SKETCH11gender as well, using the same affixes which code the gender and num­
ber of nouns. Alamblak further shares with Yimas a very productive
process of verb-compounding or serialization. Clause linkage is typically
achieved by nominalization and coordination, as in Yimas, but Alamblak
does make sparing use of switch-reference morphology (Bruce 1984).

1.3 Ethnographic SketchThe Yimas people can best be described as sedentary hunter-gatherers.
That is, while they live in permanent established villages, they do not
practice subsistence agriculture, but rather collect their food from the
surrounding forest and wetlands. The Yimas lands are very rich: the
main village is surrounded by a great expanse of swamp and eight major
lakes. These supply the staple protein source of the Yimas, fresh fish,
the most common species being tilapia, mosambia, called makau in Tok
Pisin and Yimas. The word is a loan into Yimas from Tok Pisin because
this fish species is not native to New Guinea, but South America. They
were introduced into the Sepik as the result of an accident at an ex­
perimental agricultural station in Maprik. By the mid-sixties they were
well established in the Yimas lakes. They seem to have largely replaced
indigenous species, and now constitute the largest proportion of any fish
catch. Second to makau in percentage of catch are native specifies of
catfish ( mawnta). Fishing is largely the province of the women, who use
nets purchased in towns and traditional traps woven from reeds in this
task. Men provide a relatively minor supplement of fish by spear fishing,
using multiple-prong spears.
Hunting is exclusively the domain of men. While fishing is done daily
by nearly all the women, hunting is a rather irregular, more infrequent
activity. The male members of the tribe vary greatly in their enthusi­
asm for hunting, some going out on a hunt a couple of times a week,
some never going. The major animals hunted are wild pigs ( numpran)
and possums ( tuvkntuma), but cassowaries ( awa), which are extremely
dangerous large flightless birds, and wallabies ( warkawpwi) , smaller re­
lations of kangaroos, are also taken, albeit rarely. Men also shoot ducks
( manpakwarv) and other wild birds, such as the large crowned pigeon
or gouria ( mpuvkan). Crocodiles ( manpa) are also eaten, but they are
never hunted as food per se. They are hunted for their skins, which are12THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSdried and sold as a source of cash. The carcass of the crocodile is then
eaten. Meat from hunting is a much less important protein source in the
Yimas diet than fish, but it does provide a much-desired respite from a
constant bland fare of fish.
The staple carbohydrate for Yimas is sago derived from the sago
palm tree, Metroxylum rumphii ( tnum). The gathering of sago is a
cooperative effort involving both men and women. The men cut down
the sago palm, strip off its bark ( kapwa) , and pulverize (pan-) the pith
of the tree with blunt adzes ( awi) . The pulverized pith ( tki) is placed
in large woven baskets (pantimpram) and passed to the women. The
women set up a canoe with a small wooden frame at one end as the
catchment for the washed sago pith. The women wash ( tuk-) the sago
pith by placing it in another type of woven basket ( walamuv) , filling
it with water and squeezing the basket over the wooden frame. The
sago flour ( wampunv) flows out through the holes in the basket and,
being very heavy, collects in the bottom of the canoe. The women
finish washing the sago pith and then scoop out all the water from the
canoe. They then collect the sago flour and place it in clay storage pots
( yavi).","[31, 32, 33, 34]"

Each of the nouns in these compounds constitute a phonological word in
themselves, as shown by the individual primary stresses. Yet they form
one grammatical word in that there is only one inflection for number,
and this on the head (rightmost) noun:
numpray
(2-30) a. num-n
village SG-OBL pig III PL
'domesticated pigs'
b. * numkat-n

the head noun; modifiers of the compound exhibit only its specifications
for their concord suffix.

The latter is ungrammatical because the adjective registers concord with
the internal noun kalk 'sago pudding'. The prohibition on number in­
flection for the internal noun and the impermissibility of concord with
it is explicable if we conclude that these are single grammatical words
with grammatical features being determined by the head noun (see also
discussion of nominal compounding in Di Sciullo and Williams 1987).
As the nominal complexes in (2-29) have been established as single
grammatical words, according to the writing conventions propounded
above, strictly speaking they should be written all together as a sin­
gle word. I do not do this in noun compounds for two reasons. First,
they are closely paralleled by many productive English noun compounds,
which by the conventions of English phonology are typically written as
separate words (see Palmer 1984) . But more significantly, this differen­
tial application of my conventions to nouns and verbs as grammatical
words reflects an important difference between them. With the excep­
tion of the oblique suffix, the units which make up noun compounds are
words in their own right, both phonological and grammatical, and can87A NOTE ON O RTHOGRAPHYbe used as independent nouns in other constructions. I use the conven­
tion of writing them separately to indicate this freedom of occurrence.
But this is definitely not true of most of the types of units which come
together to form a verbal grammatical unit. Consider this example:
( 2-32) na-mpi-yakal-cantaw-ant-ntut
3SG 0-3DL A-CONT-sit-hear-RM PAST
'They both sat listening to him.'
This is a single grammatical word, but three phonological words, as in­
dicated by the primary stresses. Of the six formal units which make up
this word, only two ( tantaw- 'sit down' and ant- 'hear', as verb roots)
can independently occur in a wide range of constructions, parallel to the
nouns in the above noun compounds. The other four are grammatical
morphemes like inflectional affixes in more familiar languages. Of special
interest is the continuative aspect marker yakal-. While a phonological
word, it can never function as a verb root or on its own. It is restricted to
occurring before a following verb or verb compound as the means of ex­
pressing its aspectual character. The great majority of morpheme types
which constitute a verbal grammatical word are like this, and for this rea­
son I follow the convention of writing these as a single orthographic word.
2.7 A Note on Orthography
In the remainder of this book I will use a standardized practical orthogra­
phy for writing Yimas. (I have already used this in the final examples of
the previous section.) It is essentially a compromise between the under­
lying systematic phonemic representations and the taxonomic phonemic
forms, but with a closer approach to the latter. For example, final stops
which are deleted by the final nasal plus stop cluster simplification rule
(2-14) will not be written. Thus, the underlying fawklmp/ 'wrist' will
be written as awklm. This reflects a surface phonemic representation.
Vowels, on the other hand, reflect more closely the underlying represen­
tations. Epenthetic vowels will not be written, but u (i.e., ) presentsXsome problems. Because of R spreading, it is not always possible to
determine which syllable, if any, is linked to the autosegment R (see
Section 2.3.4). A case in point is tupuniv 'firefly' . Underlyingly this
would be represented as
ecceIIII..!.R_ n U
R
with R hovering over the first two syllables (it cannot spread further to
t. hc right, because /n/, a [-peripheral] consonant, blocks R spreading) .","[107, 108, 109]"

'father's sister's

- um as the basic allomorph, a position which will be supported by the
agreement affixes below. This analysis does require us to claim that
forms like 'father' and 'brother' have irregular plural stems, i.e. , apwia­
and mamaya-, so it may seem that we have just exchanged complexity
in the plural allomorphs for complexity in the stems. But as we shall see
below, a productive contraction of -um > - m after /a/ is a basic rule of
Yimas so this analysis is in fact warranted.
It must be noted here that the underlying form of -um is in fact -ump,
with the rule of final nasal + stop cluster simplification (2-14) applying
to convert - ump to - um in final position. The fp/ will surface when
the plural suffix is protected by another suffix (payump-n kumpwi man I
PL-OBL child I PL 'boys'). Thus the basic morphologically conditioned
allomorphs for plural for class I plurals are -(vk ) at, -(n) tt, and -umpNOUN CLASSES123(-i being basically a phonologically conditioned variant) . There seems
no way to predict which will be used for a given noun and this must
be indicated lexically. Compare, as a final example, matn 'brother', PL:
matnum with apanwakn 'old man', PL: apawakntt. Both stems end in
/n/, but take different plural allomorphs.
As discussed in Chapter 3, all noun classes have a set of agreement
suffixes and another set of agreement prefixes. The agreement suffixes
are used with adjectives to mark them for the same number/class fea­
tures of their modified noun and also with possessive pronouns for the
same function. For most noun classes, exactly the same set of suffixes
are used for both adjectives and possessive pronouns. Class I is aberrant
in that in the singular and dual, it has distinct suffixes for adjectival ver­
sus possessive agreement. The adjectival agreement suffixes for class I
are as follows:
SG
DL
PL
-n
-mampan
-ump
The plural agreement suffix - ump (which will of course surface as - um in
final position) again loses its /u/ following /a/. Examples of the usage
of these suffixes follow:
( 4-3) a. kalakn
yua-n
child I SG good-I SG
'a good child'
b. namarawrm urkpwica-k-mampan
person I DL black-IRR-I PL
'two black persons'
kpa-m
c. payum
man I PL big-I PL
'big men'
These non-singular agreement suffixes are always used for class I nouns
regardless of the dual or plural allomorphs on the noun itself, with the
single exception of the suppletive plural kumpwi 'children' for kalakn
'child'. This noun takes the adjectival suffix -i and in all formal particu­
lars behaves like a class VIII singular noun (see Section 4.1.8). Contrast
(4-4) with (4-3c) above:
( 4-4) kumpwi waca-k-i
child I PL small-IRR-I PL
'small children'
I n fact, the form wacaki 'kids' is often used as a noun, as a synonym for
kumpwi . Adjectives or adjectival verbs suffixed with class I adjectival
�mffixes often function as nouns in Yimas. Other examples appear below:124NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES'Europeans'

The possessive suffixes for class I contrast with the adjectival set in
both singular and dual. They are as follows:
DL
PL
SG
-kn
-ump
-rm
Possessive pronouns in Yimas are formed by suffixing the possessive
marker -na to the bound possessive form of the pronoun (see also Section
4.5). Following -na are the agreement suffixes, such as those for class I
above. Examples with a first person singular possessor follow:
(4-5) a. apwi
ama-na-kn
father I SG lSG-POSS-1 SG
'my father'
ama-na-rm

brother-! DL lSG-POSS-1 DL
'my two brothers'
c. takulct
ama-na-m
brother-in-law I PL lSG-POSS-1 PL
'my brothers-in-law'
Note that here the dual suffix - rm appears without the epenthetic /t/,
further evidence that it is the basic form (the noun modified in ( 4-5b)
does have the epenthetic / t /, but this does not effect the possessive
agreement suffix) . The plural suffix - ump appears as - m because of the
preceding /a/.
Both class I and class II, the two classes referring to human beings,
have the same set of verbal prefixes. Further, these prefixes correspond
to the basic set of intransitive verbal person/number prefixes used for
third person (for a full explication of basic person and number affixes to
the verb see Sections 5 . 1 . 1 and 5.1.2). The verbal prefixes for classes I
and II are as follows:
DL
PL
SG
naimpapuNote that these verbal prefixes are fairly closely related in form to the
adjectival suffixes, and may be viewed as being essentially derived fromNOUN CLASSES125them, by metathesizing their sequence of phonological segments. So the
plural adjective suffix -ump becomes the verbal prefix pu- by this process
of metathesis. This is a general feature of noun classes in Yimas, and
for most, it is more regular than for class I, which exhibits a number
of complications. The singular and dual verbal prefixes na- and impa-,
while clearly relatable to the adjectival suffixes - n and -mampan, cannot
be claimed to be derived from them transparently by this same process
of metathesis.
These verbal prefixes are used to express the subject of an intransi­
tive verb and the object of a transitive verb, but not the subject of a
transitive verb. This then is an ergative-absolutive system of argument
marking (see Section 5.1.1). Examples of their use with intransitive
verbs follow:

forms above, only 'one' is regularly formed. 'Three' is totally supple­
t.ive, while 'two' has an unexpected prefix form impu- instead of impa-.
'Four', if regular, would be something like *ma-mampan-ama-mampan,
but obviously this is not the case. Rather there is an unusual dual form
npa following the first instance of ma- 'other' . This may be a spo--126NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESradic contraction of - mampan, i.e., * ma+mampan > ma-npa. Also, the
final suffix is the possessive dual suffix -rm, rather than the expected
- mampan. This may reflect an analogy with the form for 'four' in classes
III and V, which is not too dissimilar from this form.
Finally, the deictic stems for class I are formed almost totally regu­
larly. The verbal prefixes are added to the proximal and far distal stems
and the adjectival suffixes to the near distal stem. The following gives
the deictic forms for class I for each of the three deictic stems:
DL
PL
SG
PROX
na-k
impa-k
pu-k
NR DIST
m-n
m-rm
m-um
FR DIST
na-n
impa-n
pu-n
The only irregularity here is the dual form for the near distal deictic in
which the possessive concord suffix is found, rather than the adjectival
form: m-rm, rather than * m-mampan.
4.1.2 Class II
Class II is the class of female humans. A majority of words in this class
are marked with the suffix - mav, a distinctive badge of the female sex.
Examples of class II nouns include the following:
SG
DL
PL
narma:u
narmprum
'woman/wife'
:uaykum
:uay(u)k
:uaykrm
:uaykumpam 'mother'

macawkma:u macawkmprum macawkmput 'mother-in-law'
marma:u

'sister-in-law' (� ego)
marmput
pranma:u
pranprum
'daughter-in-law'
pranput

kacanma:u
kacanprum

awayma:u

awaymput
'mother's brother's
wife'
apanwaknma:u apanwaknprum apanwaknput 'old woman'
kayantakima:u kayantakimprum kayantakinput 'female spirit'
This class is nearly as irregular as class I. The dual is formed in two
ways. If the singular noun has the distinctive marker of class II, - mav,
then the dual is formed with the distinctive class II dual suffix, - mprum,NOUN CLASSES127often with nasal truncation (rule (2-15)) if the singular stem ends in a
nasal. For example, the singular form kacan-mav son-in-law's mother­
II SG becomes kacan-prum in the dual, with the loss of the nasal /m/
after the stem final /n/, according to rule (2-15). Singular class II nouns
lacking - mav form their duals exactly as do class I nouns, employing the
suffix -rm, with or without epenthetic jtj. The /t/ is inserted-this is
done according to the same rule ( 4-1 ) as for class I nouns.

The second V in the phonetic form is, of course, realized as i, but since
it would be predictable anyway between the cluster /kc/, it is omitted
orthographically.
As with class I, the plurals of class II are more complicated. With
the single exception of 'woman', the forms in - mav form their plural
regularly by the suffix - mput, again subject to the nasal truncation rule
(2-15). The plural of 'woman' is clearly formed from the stem of 'mother'
plus the class I plural suffix -ump. This in turn has required a new form
for the plural of 'mother', which is this plural form of 'woman' plus
- am, perhaps on analogy with the plural of 'fathers' apwiam. The word
apak 'sister' forms its dual and plural exactly as do class I stems ending
in /k/, so these variants are probably phonologically conditioned. The
plural of kaywi 'daughter, girl' is clearly a compound made up of the
plural of 'woman' plus the oblique suffix and the plural of the class I
noun kalakn 'son, child, boy' ( vaykump-n kumpwi woman II PL-OBL
1:hild I PL 'daughters, girls' ). Finally, the plural of vaki ' father's sister' ,128NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESvakpct, is completely unpredictable. It shows the same kind of irregular
plural formation as class I nouns like 'brother-in-law' and 'ceremonial
companion', and would simply need to have its plural specified in the
lexicon.
Unlike class I, class II has the same set of suffixes for both adjectival
and possessive forms. They are as follows:
DL
PL
SG
-nput
-nprump
-nma!J
(The final /p/ of - nprump DL is normally deleted by rule (2-14). Only
when the oblique suffix - n ""' -nan follows will the stop appear.) These
are derived by compounding the typical class II suffixes -mav, - mprum,
- mput, and the suffix -n (possibly from singular class I) with the usual
nasal truncation in the dual and plural. The same agreement suffixes are
used for possessives, but are always preceded by an epenthetic /k/, prob­
ably on analogy with the class I singular possessive suffix -kn. Examples
of class II nouns with possessives and adjectives are offered below:
( 4-7) a. apak
yua-nma!J
sister-II SG good-II SG
'a good sister'
b. kaywcrm
waca-k-nprum ama-na-knprum
daughter II DL small-IRR-II DL I SG-POSS-II DL
'my two small daughters'
c. !Jaykum
ma-nput
woman II PL other-II PL
'other women'
As with the class I suffixes, these are often added to adjectives or adjec­
tival verbs to form nouns.
yarac-k
+ -nma!J > yaracknma!J 'European woman'
II SG
white-IRR
waca-k
+ -nprum > wacaknprum 'two little sisters' (� ego)
small-IRR
II DL
kpa'big sisters' (� ego)
+ -nput
> kpanput
big
II PL
The verbal prefixes, numerals, and deictics for class II are identical
to those of class I, with the single exception of the word for 'one'. Here
the typical adjectival agreement suffix for class II singular is suffixed to
the stem for 'one' to produce mpa-nmav one-II SG.
4.1.3 Class III
Class III is the class for higher animals, such as pigs, dogs, and crocodiles,
and as such has grammatical features halfway between those of class I,NOUN CLASSES129the unmarked human class, and class V, the unmarked class for inani­
mate nouns and the one which includes the majority of lower animals.
Examples of nouns belonging to class III follow:

paradise'
wakrapak wakrapakntrm wakrapakawi 'large eel'
This class only includes higher animals, those important to humans,
such as pets, domesticated livestock, other sources of food, ceremonial
accoutrements or mythological figures. There is not a sharp boundary
between the animals of this class and those included in class V or the
other inanimate classes. Depending on the role an animal plays in a
particular discourse it may be upgraded from class V and occur with
the typical affixes of class III. This upgrading may even sporadically
occur with class III nouns. I have a few cases of numpran 'pig', a clear
class III noun, with the forms of class I, the unmarked human class.
Furthermore, some of the nouns listed above as class III may also belong
to class V, especially the names of the lower mammals, like the possums,
and the birds. In fact, the word for 'white possum' irwan is not included
above, in spite of the fact that it belongs to the general class tuvkntuma
' possum', because it takes -ra, the typical class V plural suffix following
/u/ (irwan-ra 'white possums') and would normally be associated with
class V agreement affixes. However, the other words for types of possum
utay also be seen with these affixes. Clearly, the boundary between
classes III and V is anything but sharp for these lower animals.
The formation of non-singulars in class III is much less complicated
tlt a11 in classes I and II. All duals are formed with the suffix -ntrm; in
ot.lwr words, the rules of /t/ and /n/ epenthesis (rules (4-1) and (4-2) )NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES130are obligatory for nouns of this class. The /n/ is, of course, subject to
nasal truncation (rule (2- 15)) if the stem should end in a nasal ( tmarmav
'red possum' + -ntrm DL > tmarmavtrm). The plural is slightly more
complex. There are two allomorphs, -(w)i and -vkat. The former is
restricted to nouns where singular forms end in /a/ (numpran 'pig' and
nawkwan 'chicken' are exceptions, but note that the plural is irregular
in the loss of the final /n/, again producing a stem ending in /a/).
The epenthetic /w/ in many nouns with this plural allomorph probably
reflects an earlier stem form ending in / aw /. (Karawari has the singular
form manpo for 'crocodile', with contraction of jaw/ to joj. Yimas has
a productive rule which simplifies word-final jaw/ diphthongs to /a/;
see Section 4.1.9). The plural suffix -i would protect the final /w/ so
that it surfaces in the plural forms. However, this rule cannot be set up
as productive for class III nouns (as opposed to class IX noun8 ) , because
a glance at the dual forms above shows that they have the simple vowel
/a/ rather than the expected * /aw j. The duals have probably been
re-formed by analogy on the basis of the singulars, but the difference
between the dual and plural forms demonstrates that the allomorphy
of - wi ""' - i cannot be put down to productive phonological rules, but
again must be entered as a morphologically conditioned variant. The
second plural allomorph for class III nouns, -vkat, is used with nouns
not ending in /a/. This is a common plural marker for class V nouns; in
fact, it is the unmarked one, and may have spread from class V to class
III, replacing earlier plural endings.
The adjectival/possessive suffixes for class III nouns are closely re­
lated to those of class I and class V, but are distinct from both.

with class I.

The only new form is the dual prefix for class III, tma-. This is clearly
related to the adjectival/possessive suffix -rm, where /r/ becomes t in
initial position (/r/ may not occur word-initially in Yimas). Unlike the
other forms, there is no metathesis of consonant and vowel in the deriva­
tion of this verbal prefix from the corresponding adjectival/possessive
suffix. The suffix - rm is simply converted to a prefix tma-. The final /a/
is not completely explicable, but may be the result of analogy with all the
other classes, for which the dual verbal prefix always ends in an /a/. The
following are examples of the usage of verbal prefixes for class III nouns:
( 4-9) a. numprantrm tma-na-tampulanta-n

III DL S-DEF-run-PRES
'The two pigs are running. '
pu-aw!Jkwi-kia-ntut
b . manpawi
crocodile III lPL III PL S-sink-NIGHT-RM PAST
'The crocodiles went down.'
The numerals of class III generally are very different from those of class
I and are identical in form to those of class V.
'one'
'three'
tamunum
mpa-n
'four'
maramarm
tm-pal
'two'
'One' and 'two' are formed regularly, 'two' by prefixing the verbal prefix
tm- minus the final /a/. 'Three' is totally suppletive; this suppletion is
ancient, going back to Proto-Lower Sepik, as Chambri has the cognate
form for 'three' samnenamp. The form for 'four' is still based on ma­
'other', but in this case probably derives from contraction of a form with
-rm ( ma-rm+ama-rm > maramarm) .
The deictics o f class III are formed in the regular way by adding
the verbal prefixes to the proximal and far distal deictic stems and the
adjectival/possessive suffixes to the near distal stem, resulting again in
forms which are a mix of classes I and V.

4.1.4 Class IV
This class is restricted almost completely to plants and trees, many of
them important to human activities. Not all words for plants and trees
are in this class, but many are. Its diagnostic marker is a stem-final
-um, and in many ways this class is similar to the phonologically based
classes VI through X. Consider the following examples from this class:

The word mavkum 'vein, tendon', of course, does not denote a plant or
tree, but the physical similarity of these to a vine is clearly the basis
for the assignment of this noun to class IV. The assignment of tuanum
'black beetle' to this class is quite unexpected. The only explanation is
the people's observation that it comes up from the ground like grass. The
singular forms of all class IV nouns end in -m, underlying -um . The /u/
deletes according to rule (2-9) between a stop and a homorganic nasal
in the final syllable (/irp-um/ > irpm 'coconut palm') and idiosyncrat­
ically, for this suffix, following an /a/ (/takupa-um/ > tapukam 'tree
(sp)'). This deletion of /u/ following /a/ also applies to the very similar
class I plural marker - ump, but as we shall see when considering the
markers for class X, this is not a general feature of noun class mark­
ers beginning in /u/. That the /u/ is in fact underlyingly present is
demonstrated by the operation of roundedness dissimilation.","[144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154]"
"TENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD253The same negative number suffixes again reference the number of the
S argument, but the third person forms contrast with the first person
forms in ( 5-98) in that all distinctions in number in the pronominal
prefixes are lost. All four numbers in the third person are expressed
by the same prefix pu-, the normal S/0 pronominal prefix for third
plural. Note further that whereas the negative forms for intransitive
verbs with first person S arguments reveal an underlying nominative­
accusative role-marking schema in that the S argument is realized by
the A prefix form, third person arguments continue to show an ergative­
absolutive alignment in both positive and negative forms. Thus, all third
person S arguments regardless of number are expressed in negated verbs
by the pronominal prefix pu- 3 PL S/0, the actual number being carried
by the negative number suffixes. I will again take up this question of
the accusative versus ergative split in negative verbs when discussing
transitive verbs below.
Second person S arguments show an interesting feature as a result
of the inflectional patterns of the positive verbs. Remember that the
pronominal prefix n- is homophonous for 2/3SG A, but that the other
numbers in second person show no similarity with third person. This
overlap is also exhibited in the negative verbs. Negative verbs with
second singular S arguments have pu- (typical of third person), and the
pronominal prefix n-, the normal form for second singular A, used in
this case for an S argument (demonstrating again the usual nominative­
accusative pattern for first and second person arguments) . Consider the
following examples:
(5-100) a. ta-pu-n-wa-t
NEG-3-2SG S-go-PERF
'You didn't go. '
b. ta-nan-wa-r-um
NEG-2PL S-go-PERF-PL
'You all didn't go. '
Thus, although in positive verbs n - 2/3SG A is homophonous, the dif­
ference in negative verbs in morphological behavior of first and second
person S arguments, on the one hand, and third person, on the other,
ensures that the negative forms for verbs with second and third singular
S arguments are distinct; compare (5-lOOa) with (5-99a(ii)) .
S o far I have only considered intransitive verbs with human, pronom­
inal S arguments. An inanimate noun, of course, can also function as
an S argument, but in this case, instead of one of the negative number
suffixes above, the possessive/adjective concord marker corresponding
to the class and number of the inanimate noun is used to reference it.","[274, 275]"

'with'The branches directly off S can be rotated and shifted around freely with
no change in meaning, but this is not true of the next level of branches,
those corresponding to the phrasal units and the V. We have already
seen that the internal structure of the V is highly complex and hierar­
chically ordered. It may be that the very simple structure of the clause
level in Yimas compensates for the highly elaborate structure at lower
levels, especially inside the V. It is a commonplace among modern lin­
guistic theories that internal hierarchical structure is a universal feature
of language. This may be true, but languages like Yimas demonstrate
that such a structure need not be manifested at the clause level, where
it is commonly expected, but may show up elsewhere, where it is less
expected, for example, in the internal structure of the words. It may be
a truism that polysynthetic languages like Yimas choose to elaborate the
internal structure of words in contradistinction to phrases and clauses.
If one glances back at the phrase structure rules in (6-189) and (6194), an obvious generalization about Yimas emerges: the heads of con­
structions always occur to their right. The question then arises as to
what is the head of a clause. The only obligatory constituent of a clause
is, of course, the verb, and the rightmost obligatory constituent of a
verb is the tense morpheme. I suggest then that we consider TNS as the
head of its clause. In other words, as a noun phrase is defined by its
head noun and a postpositional phrase by its head postposition, so is
the category S defined by the tense morpheme.",[398]

Another morphologically induced stress peculiarity concerns adjecti­

Note that this rule blocks the operation of the secondary stress rule (217) for the pentasyllabic words. Normally, these would have secondary
stress on the antepenultimate syllable by rule (2-17), but rule (2-20) is
more restricted in its domain and hence overrides it, so that the sec­
ondary stress appears on the penultimate syllable, the final syllable of
the roots.
The final morphologically induced peculiarity of stress concerns verbs

In each of these cases the primary stress assigns stress to the verb root
as if there were no prefixal syllables; in other words, they are ignored

2.6 Boundaries and the Notion of the Word
If one approaches the notion of word from a formal perspective, it is
clear that it can be defined in either of two ways: either by phonological
criteria or by morphosyntactic ones. (Di Sciullo and Williams (1987)
have recently proposed that this latter actually disguises two distinct
types of criteria for the word, morphological ones versus syntactic ones.
They propose some very useful and interesting ideas, but for the pur­
poses here we will treat both of these types under the single category
of morphosyntactic criteria) . A word can be determined by phonolog­
ical criteria in terms of the rules, both segmental and suprasegmental,
whose domain is specified with respect to this notion. For example,
Yimas provides a number of rules which help us to determine words.
The final nasal plus stop cluster simplification rule (2-14) only applies
at the ends of words; initial semivowel formation (2-10) only applies at
the beginning of words; and most of the other rules, such as R spreading
(2-8), (but not, notably, palatalization (2-3)) occur internally to a word.
In addition, the stress rules of Yimas discussed in the previous section
also help to define the word, for they supply to every word unit at least
a primary stress and possibly one or more secondary stresses. Thus, any
string of phonemes which behave as a unit with respect to these rules can
be designated as a word and set off by the word boundaries before and
after it. So because the underlying phoneme sequence /awklmp/ 'wrist'
is realized phonetically as (awkulim] (from initial syllable primary stress
(2-16), vowel epenthesis (2-2), R spreading (2-8), and final nasal plusBOUNDARIES AND THE NOTION OF THE WORD81stop cluster simplification (2-14) ) , we know that it constitutes a single
word with the placement of word boundaries thus /# awklmp #/.
Turning now to morphosyntactic criteria, we can state analogously
that a word is a string of morphemes that behaves as a single unit
with respect to morphological processes in the language. The strictly
morphological processes of a language, of course, are a language-specific
fact: some languages such as Vietnamese may have no morphological
processes at all; others, like Yimas, have an exuberance of these. Let
me first consider the morphological patterns of nouns in Yimas. Nouns
are marked for number in Yimas, as well as case. Thus, consider the
above noun 'wrist' inflected for these two categories: jawklmp + l +
nan/ wrist + DL + OBL realized phonetically as [awkulimbitJlan]
'on the two wrists'. The plus sign here is used conventionally to mark
a morpheme boundary, i.e. , a boundary between morphemes internal
to a word. This form is morphologically a single composite unit. The
morphemes must occur in this order and no other:
jawklmp + l + nan/ wrist + DL + OBL,
* jawklmp + nan + 1/ wrist + OBL + DL,
* /1 + awklmp + nan/ DL + wrist + OBL, etc.
Further, no other morphemes may be inserted internal to this sequence:
* jawklmp + kpa + l + nan/ wrist + big + DL + OBL,
* /awklmp + l + kpa + nan/ wrist + DL + big + OBL,
* / awklmp + prpal + l + nan/ wrist + two + DL + OBL,
* jawklmp + l + prpal + nan/ wrist + DL + two + OBL.
From the grammatical point of view, this noun forms a composite unit,
a word, and should therefore be represented as /# awklmp + l + nan
# /, with both the internal morpheme boundaries + and the external
word boundary # indicated.
Note that the grammatical criteria in this case coincide with the
phonological criteria in defining this as a single word-level unit. Whereas
the uninflected form jawklmp/ undergoes final nasal plus stop clus­
ter simplification (2-14) to surface as [awkulim], thus indicating a word
boundary, this rule fails to apply to j awklmp + l + nan/, which is re­
alized as [awkulimbftJlan] . This leaves no doubt that there is no word
boundary between the root for 'wrist' and the DL suffix in this form.
This is buttressed by the fact that the fp/ is voiced to [b] following the
nasal. Postnasal voicing of stops in Yimas is all but obligatory internal to
a word. Further, the liquid strengthening rule (2-5) applies in this form
between the /-1/ DL and the initial /n/ of the oblique suffix /-nanj.
T his rule, like most phonological rules treated earlier, is restricted to82PHONOLOGYapplying internally to the word across morpheme boundaries. (Palatal­
ization (2-3) is the one exception here: it does commonly apply across
word boundaries.) Clearly, then, both the grammatical criteria and the
phonological criteria unambiguously identify /awklmp + 1 + nan/ wrist
+ DL + OBL [awkulimbitJlan] as a single word.
Similar considerations apply to adjectives. Consider the form of the
adjective 'big' which would modify the inflected noun above: /kpa +
mp + 1/ big + class VII + DL, realized as [kipambH] . This demonstrates
that adjectives are inflected for the class and number of their modified
noun. Again the ordering of morphemes is rigid.
* /kpa + 1 + mp/ big + DL + class VII,
* jmp + kpa + 1/ class VII + PL + big;
and nothing may be inserted between the morphemes.
* /kpa + prpal + mp + 1/ big + two + class VII + DL,
* /kpa + mp + prpal + 1/ big + class VII + two + DL,
* /kpa + plak + mp + 1/ big + this + class VII + DL,
* /kpa + mp + plak + 1/ big + class VII + this + DL.
All this indicates that /kpa + mp + 1/ big + class VII + DL is a com­
posite unit, a single word. Again the phonological criteria bring down
the same verdict. The class VII concord marker /-mp/ appears phonet­
ically as [mp] , rather than as its word final allomorph [m] derived by
final nasal plus stop cluster simplification (2-14). Clearly there is no
word boundary between the class VII concord marker and the DL suffix,
so that the form can be established as / # kpa + mp + 1 # /.
The coincidence between phonological and grammatical criteria for
determining word boundaries vanishes, however, when we turn to verbs.
They are by far the most morphologically complex part of speech in
Yimas, but here I will concern myself only with negation and valence­
increasing, both of which are marked by prefixes. Negation is an espe­
cially good diagnostic of words, for it affects both the first morpheme of
a word and the last. Negation is marked by a prefix ta-. which occupies
the first prefixal slot of the verb, usurping the normal occupier of this
slot, a pronominal prefix, and shifting this to the final suffixal slot of the
word. Thus, consider the following pair:
(2-22) a. tampaym
p-ka-apca-t
hook VII SG VII SG 0-lSG A-hang up-PERF
'I hung up the hook.'
b. tampaym
ta-ka-apca-r-m

'I didn't hang up the hook.'","[100, 101, 102, 103, 104]"
"6The Verb Theme and Clause
Structure6.1 Yimas as a Polysynthetic Language
In this chapter and the next I will deal with what might be called the
'syntax' of Yimas. I put this word in quotes because to a very great
extent Yimas lacks the features that we take as diagnostic of syntax in
the more familiar languages of Western Europe. Other than the minimal
noun phrase discussed in Section 4 .6, the syntactic landscape of Yimas
strikes a speaker of a western European language as very alien territory
indeed, presenting very few analogues to the syntactic constituents we
have come to expect.
Like many Amerindian languages, Yimas may be described as poly­
synthetic. Boas ( 1911 , 74) defined this feature as follows: ""a large num­
ber of distinct ideas are amalgamated by grammatical processes and
form a single word, without any morphological distinction between the
formal elements in the sentence and the contents of the sentence."" In
other words, a word (especially a verbal word) in a polysynthetic lan­
!!;Uage corresponds in the range of distinct ideas expressed in it to what
is articulated by a sentence in more familiar languages. To see how this
applies to Yimas, consider the following examples (the square brack­
ds indicate the structural level of verb theme, which will be defined
later) :
( 6- 1) a. ka-mpu-[pay-ma-takat ]-.Jla-mpan-m
LIKE-3PL A-first-in-touch-IMP-3PL D-VII SG T

b. ya-mpu-[nanaiJ-tacay-ckam]-tuk-mpun

'They were showing those very carefully to them.'

e. na-n-[mampi-taJJ-tal-kulanalJ]
3SG 0-3SG A-again-COM-CAUS-walk
'He made him walk with him again. '
All of these examples constitute single words, yet are translated by
sentences in English, in some cases (6-lc,d) by quite complex sen­
tences. That these are single words is clearly supported by a num­
ber of facts. First, these sequences are fully coherent and are not
interruptible. For example, no word or phrase can come between
kwalca-mpi arise-SEQ and kulanav walk in (6- ld) , in spite of the fact
that, from the English point of view these would seem to be sepa­
rate words. Note that in the English translation, the adverb quickly
occurs between these two verbs; this is not possible in the Yimas
form.
Second, the verbal morphology discussed in detail in Chapter 5 ap­
plies to these verbal forms as a whole, not individually. Note that the
tense suffixes in the above forms occur only once, following the last verb
root. Further, the pronominal affixes which mark the core arguments
have scope over the whole complex. Thus, in (6-lb) the 0 and A argu­
ments are indicated by the initial prefixes and the D argument by the
final suffix. In (6-lc) the A argument is marked by the second prefix
vkl- 3PC A (immediately following ta- NEG), and the 0 argument by
the final suffix - nak 3SG. In the corresponding positive sentence, of
course, both the A and the 0 would be indicated by prefixes. Perhaps
the most striking case is the long example in (6-ld). Here the S argu­
ment is expressed by the initial prefix pavkra- lPC S, and its number is
again referenced by the final suffix -vkt PC, eight morphemes away!
Third, the ordering of morphemes within these complexes is rigid.
For example, in ( 6-la,e) any ordering of morphemes other than that
given will result in ungrammatical forms. In a very few cases alternative
orderings are possible, but with no appreciable difference in meaning.

"ADJECTIVES99tamana 'sick' functions as an adjectival noun in a phrase with kantk- in
(3-17a) , but as a nominal subject agreeing with the verb in number/class
in ( 3- 17b) . Only a noun could function as tamana does in ( 3-17b).
The postposition kantk- is used in these adjectival noun constructions
to carry the normal adjectival concord suffixes for the modified noun.
Other examples of the class of adjectival nouns are:
'sad'
'cold'
tark
yapan
'happy'
'dirty' wurk
wapun
'ashamed' irmut
Because these stems are basically nouns, they do not form inchoatives
in the same way as the true adjectives or adjectival verbs. Consider the
stative construction and the inchoative construction for the adjectival
noun wapun 'happy'.
kantk-n
(3-18) a. wapun
amayak
happy V SG with-V SG COP 1SG
'I'm happy. '
b. wapun
kantk-n
ama-na-ti-n
happy V SG with-V SG 1SG S-DEF-become-PRES
'I'm becoming/feeling happy. '
The first sentence means something like 'I have or am feeling some­
thing which is good, so I am happy' . The second goes like 'I am do­
ing/experiencing something good, and I'm becoming/feeling happy be­
cause of that.' The first sentence would be uttered when a person is
happy because of the property or clothes he owns, while the second is
appropriate to contexts of, say, just finishing a carving or house. Thus,
the form with the copula is appropriate for longer duration or relatively
permanent states and the form with ti- for transitory states or changes
of state. But there are other inchoative constructions available to adjec­
tival nouns by virtue of their status as nouns.
(3-19) a. wapun
ama-na-pay-n
happy V SG 1SG S-DEF-liejcarry-PRES
'I'm feeling happy. '
b. wapun
na-IJa-na-ti-n
happy V SG V SG S-1SG 0-DEF-dojfeel-PRES
'I'm feeling happy.' (literally 'happiness does/feels on me')
In these examples the adjectival noun functions as a nominal core argu­
ment of the verb-an object in (3-19a) and a subject in (3- 19b) . These
t.wo sentences contrast in meaning. (3-19a) means 'I'm doing something
��:ood and I'm feeling happy because of that', i.e., very close in meaning
t.o (3- 1 8b) . The difference between (3-18b) and (3-19a) is that the lat-100WORD CLASSESter is appropriate in contexts describing something about the speaker's
demeanor and appearance. For example, if the speaker has just dressed
up in new clothes and thinks he looks very handsome and smart, he
will likely utter (3-19a). (3-18b) , on the other hand, is more appropri­
ate when just having finished a difficult task. The final construction
(3-19b) contrasts with both (3-18b) and (3-19a) in that one feels happy
not because of anything one has done, but because of something that has
happened, often without any input from the experiencer. (3-19b) then
would be an appropriate utterance on just winning the lottery or receiv­
ing an unsolicited gift. Constructions such as (3-19b) are only possible
for adjectival nouns denoting human sensations (see (3-17b) also) . Con­
sider their construction with upwi 'hot' (compare with (3-16b) above) :
(3-20) a. narm
upwi p-ua-na-wampaki-n
skin VII SG hot VII SG A-1SG D-DEF-throw-PRES
'I'm feeling hot.' (literally 'skin throws heat on me'
'my skin throws heat')
b. narm
upwi p-ua-na-ti-n
skin VII SG hot VII SG A-1SG D-DEF-do/feel-PRES
'I'm feeling hot.' (literally 'skin does heat on me' or
'my skin does/feels heat')
Again, these constructions express an involuntary change of state which
the experiencer does nothing to bring about. It is something which hap­
pens to him, rather than something he does. This contrast between vol­
untary actions and involuntary changes in state, especially of sensations,
is a pervasive feature of Papuan languages and is realized morphologi­
cally and syntactically in many of them (see Foley 1986, 121-7).
The final stems expressing qualities which I wish to consider in this
section are those denoting speed. In Yimas, these are not adjectives,
verbs, or nouns; they are adverbs, normally bound morphemes incorpo­
rated directly into the verbal complex.
(3-21) a. kay

'The canoe is fast. '

c. kaykaykay kay

d. * kay
canoe VIII SG fast-IRR-VIII SGQUANTIFIERS101Stems denoting speed can only modify nouns as part of a verb complex
as in (3-21a, b) . Used as adjectives stems, either without -k (3-21c) or
with (3-21d) , they produce ungrammatical constructions.
3.4 Quantifiers
The numeral system of Yimas is quite complex, but is based fundamen­
tally on the fingers and toes of a human being. It operates simultane­
ously with three bases: base twenty, base ten and base five. The stems
denoting these bases are invariable, but all other numerals vary for noun
class depending on the features of the noun which are being counted.
Further, not all numerals agreeing for noun class do so in the same
way: the numbers 'one' and 'four' (and higher numbers ending in these
units) agree like adjectives using suffixes, while 'two' and 'three' (and
again higher numbers ending in these units) take the verbal agreement
prefixes. Thus, for the class VII noun tanm 'bone', mpa- 'one' takes
the adjectival agreement suffix -m ( tanm mpa-m 'one bone'), but -rpal
'two' takes the verbal agreement prefix p- ( tanpl p-rpal 'two bones').
Although 'two' and 'bones' are obviously not singular, only the singular
noun class affixes are used on the numerals. Interestingly, this general­
ization is not true of other Lower Sepik languages like Chambri, which
do employ the non-singular concord markers on numerals. Yimas also
presents a considerable degree of suppletion in its number system, which
will be discussed in the sections on the noun classes in Chapter 4.
The first three numerals are monomorphemic stems which vary for
the class of the noun counted: mpa- 'one', -rpal 'two' and -ramnawt
'three'. 'Four' is derived from the adjective stem rna- 'other' plus the
relevant number/class suffix for dual number reduplicated, i.e., 'other
two and other two' equals 'four'. 'Four' is the one exception to the
rule that only the singular gender class suffixes are used on the Yimas
numerals. So for a class VII noun like tanm 'bone', we have the following
paradigm:
tanm mpa-m
'one bone'
tanpl p-rpal
'two bones'
tanpat p-ramnawt
'three bones'
tanpat ma-mpl+ama-mpl 'four bones'
' Five' is the invariable base tam, while 'six' through 'nine' are formed
from this invariable base plus mawvkwat 'other side' plus 'one' through
' four'. So:
tanpat tam
'five bones'
tanpat tam mawukwat mpa-m 'six bones'
tanpat tam mawukwat p-rpal
'seven bones'102WORD CLASSES'eight bones'
tanpat tam mawJ]kwat p-ramnawt
tanpat tam mawJ]kwat ma-mpl+ama-mpl 'nine bones'
'Ten' is another invariable base: nuvkara-wl hand-DL 'two hands'.
'Eleven' through 'nineteen' are formed from this base plus arm-tap-mpi
jump.down-COMP-SEQ 'and then jump down' plus pamk-n leg-OBL 'on
the leg' plus the numbers 'one' through 'nine'. For example:
nulJkarawl arm-tap-mpi
tanpat
bone VII PL hand DL jump down-COMP-SEQ
pamk-n mpa-m
leg-OBL one-VII
'eleven bones'
tanpat nuJ]karawl armtapmpi pamkn tam maw1Jkwat mpam
'sixteen bones'
tanpat nulJkarawl armtapmpi pamkn tam maw1Jkwat
mamplamampl
'nineteen bones'
'Twenty' is the invariable base namarawt munta-k-n person whole-IRR-1
SG 'a whole person'.
tanpat namarawt muntakn 'twenty bones'
Numbers above 'twenty' are simply 'twenty' plus 'one' through 'nine­
teen'. These higher numerals are in practice never used, Tok Pisin being
the invariable choice here, but the system does make them possible. The
following is acceptable, although I have never heard it spontaneously ut­
tered:
tanpat namarawt muntakn nulJ karawl armtapmpi pamkn tam
mawl]kwat mpam
'thirty-six bones'
Following this logic, 'forty' would be namaraw-rm muntak-rm impu-mpal
person-! DL whole-! DL I DL-two 'two whole men.' The numeral system
can continue producing numbers infinitely with this logic. For higher
numbers, simply divide by base twenty, then base ten, and then base
five, with the remainder realized as 'one' through 'four'. So again the
following is acceptable, but never actually spontaneously said:
muntak-um manpamarm
tanpat
namat
bone VII PL person I PL whole-1 PL four I
nulJ karawl arm-tap-mpi
pamk-n
hand DL jump down-COMP-SEQ leg-OBL
tam maw1Jkwat mamplamampl
five other side four VII
'ninety-nine bones'QUANTIFIERS103Given the extreme complexity of an example like this it is pretty clear
why it is never used: it is far too difficult both to construct and to
process. In a sense this comment applies to the whole numeral system
in Yimas. The complex paraphrases for any number above 'five' and the
great variations in form for numbers below 'five' make the whole system
quite unwieldy. It is not surprising then that as a whole it is giving way
and most younger speakers control it poorly, if at all. These speakers
just substitute the simple numerals of Tok Pisin.
In addition to the cardinal numerals, Yimas possesses a defective
set of ordinal numerals. These only go as far as 'fourth'. The forms
for 'second' through 'fourth' are derived from the cardinal numerals
for classes I and II by suffixing a form -jlawt, except for 'third' which
is derived in the same way from the form for 'three' in classes III
and V.

'three' tamunum
'four'

'second' impumpat]lawt
tamunumputjlawt
'third'
'fourth' manpamarmputjlawtThe form for 'first' is suppletive; it is kavkran, which also has the
meaning 'before'. 'Last' is expressed by the invariable word nawt,
which in other circumstances expresses 'prototypical, the most com­
mon or typical exemplar of a category, real, true'. For example nawt­
JW1)kun 'prototype-mosquito' refers to the most common ordinary brown
mosquito in the area. This Yimas correlation of 'last' and 'prototypi­
cal' is not too dissimilar from the English ambiguity in the word ulti­
mate. When used specifically in the meaning 'last', nawt is normally
compounded with the cardinal numeral for one mpa-, so the result for
class VII is nawt mpa-m 'last one', 'last'. It is also commonly com­
pounded with the other cardinal numerals to express concepts such as
'the last two'.
nawt p-ral
last VII-two
'the last two'
These ordinal numerals are never inflected with agreement suffixes
for the nouns they modify; they are simply juxtaposed and may occur
on either side of the noun. Further, with the exceptions of kavkran
'first' and nawt 'last', they are restricted to modifying animate, partic­
ularly human, nouns. For inanimate nouns, circumlocutions such as the
following are necessary; compare (a) and (d) with (b) and (c) :WORD CLASSES104kaJJkran wul-k-um

The final type of numerals to consider are the adverbial numbers

nate, using the dual form kvkl 'times' plus the proper cardinal number.","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126]"

The verbs ant- 'hear' and kra- 'cut' are bivalent, yet the constructions in
which they occur are ditransitive, with three core arguments: A, T, and
D participants. Note that in neither of these cases is there any valence
increasing morphology which would license the extra core argument, al­
though, as we shall see below, there are semantic conditions on when
this is permitted (see Section 6.2.3.2). In any case, examples like those
of (6-10) and, to a lesser extent, those in (6-9) demonstrate that the re­
lationship between the valence of a verb and its transitivity is somewhat
fluid in Yimas.
It is important to note further than the transitivity of a verb is
properly a feature of the verb theme. Most commonly, the transitivity
of the theme is equivalent simply to the valence of the verb stem with
the highest valence index.

In (6-lla), one verb root kamal- 'search' is bivalent while the other,
kula- 'walk', is monovalent. The bivalent verb root licenses the whole
verb theme to be inflected as transitive. (6- l lb) again has two verb
roots, the bivalent wul- 'boil' and the trivalent va- 'give'. In this case
the verb theme is ditransitive because of the trivalent verb root. Finally,
(6-llc) contains two bivalent verb roots, tpul- 'hit' and kamprak- 'break
open', yet the verb theme is formally a ditransitive verb, with three core
arguments: A, T, and D. This possibility is sanctioned by the same
principles that generated the examples in (6-10) (see the discussion of
possessor-raising in Section 6.2.3.2), but note again that the three core284THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREarguments are a feature of the entire verb theme, not the individual verb
roots.
6.2.2 Verb Stem Derivations: Reciprocal Formation and Valence
Decreasing
Yimas has very little in the way of grammatical processes which decrease
the valence of a verb. There is in fact only one productive grammatical
process which may be viewed as resulting in the reduction of a verb's
valence: namely, reciprocal formation. Verbs which are marked with the
reciprocal affix are used to express actions in which two or more actors
do the same action to each other, e.g., marry (each other) , fight (hit
each other), or converse (talk to each other) . In Yimas, reciprocal verbs
are marked by the prefix ti- which bears a transparent formal similarity
to the verb root ti- 'do, feel, become' and may, in fact, be diachronically
related to it. The prefix ti- RCP always occurs with verb roots which
are minimally bivalent.(6-12) a. m-mpi-t-ayk-kr-mp-n

The four verb roots i n (6-12a-d) are bivalent, yet they may only occur
with a single pronominal affix, i.e., they must be formally intransitive.
It is in fact, ungrammatical to have two pronominal prefixes, in combi­
nation with ti-, as (6-13) demonstrates (compare with (6-12b) ) .
(6-13) * na-n-kwanan-ti-kratk-n
3SG S-3SG A-badly-RCP-fight-PRESSTEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES285( 6-12e ) is an example of a trivalent verb in a reciprocal construction.
It has two agreement prefixes: a T, pia- 'talk' and an A, mpi- 3DL A.
The missing pronominal affix is that which would express the dative. In
the remarks below, for simplicity of exposition I will confine myself to
bivalent verb roots, but the same claims apply as well to trivalent verbs;
simply alter all the descriptive terms used below for bivalent verb roots
to those applicable to trivalent verbs.
While clearly formally intransitive in allowing only one pronomi­
nal prefix, reciprocal verbs present a potential problem with respect to
the formal status of ti- RCP: does this prefix simply stand in place
of a core pronominal prefix, so that the verb stem still actually pos­
sesses two core argument slots, or does it truly reduce the valence of
the verb, making it monovalent, associated only with a single core ar­
gument? The way to decide this question, of course, revolves around
the role marked by the single pronominal prefix. If it is A or 0, this
argues that the verb is actually bivalent with only one core argument
realized by the pronominal prefix and the other by the prefix ti- RCP .
If the prefix is the S form, then this supports the claim that the verb
is monovalent and occurs with a single core argument, indicated by the
S prefix. Unfortunately, the examples above with third person partic­
ipants are of no help in deciding this question, because as we saw in
Chapter 5, the form of third person pronominal prefixes is often deter­
mined by linear order, and this relationship disguises their role marking.
Rather, we need to consider examples in another person, such as in the
following:
( 6-14 ) a. ipa-ti-tpul
1PL S RCP hit
'We hit each other.'
b. ipa-nanau-ti-kankantakat-]lcut
1PL S-DUR-RCP-ask-RM PAST
'We were asking each other.'
These examples argue for the second of our two alternatives, i.e., that
ti- actually reduces the valence of the verb, deriving a monovalent verb
stem from a bivalent verb root. In ( 6-14 ) the pronominal prefixes are
the S forms. As this is the only permissible pronominal prefix, these
verbs must be formally intransitive and hence monovalent, with a single
core argument. Examples like those in ( 6-14 ) with reciprocalization of
bivalent verbs, fail to provide evidence as to whether the A or the 0 is
actually lost in the process of reciprocal formation, for there is only a
single S prefix in the derived verb form. Trivalent verbs do provide such
crucial evidence.

b. * pia-kra-ti-i-kia-k
talk T-1PL D-RCP-tell-NIGHT-IRR
Note that the A prefix form is found in the reciprocal derivative of a
trivalent verb, and that the use of the D prefix results in an ungram­
matical sentence. This indicates that it is the non-A participant which
is suppressed in a reciprocal verb derivation. Looked at in another
way, it is the non-A argument which is bound by the A, and not vice
versa.
There is still another piece of evidence supporting the analysis of
ti- RCP as a valence decreaser. Yimas has a productive system of non­
finite nominalization (see Section 7.1), and for these constructions, ver­
bal pronominal affixes are entirely prohibited. But these nominalizations
can be formed with a verb prefixed by ti- RCP.
apiak
ti-i-c-mpwi
(6-16) karmp-n
vernacular-OBL RCP-tell-NFN-talk COP talk
'There was talking among them in the vernacular.'
If ti- is analyzed as an pronominal prefix indicating coreference with a
preceding prefix, examples like (6-16), in which there is no other per­
missible pronominal prefix, become hard to explain. On the other hand,
if ti- RCP is simply a valence decreasing prefix, deriving a bivalent verb
stem from the trivalent verb root i- 'tell', then ( 6-16) is unproblematical.
It is common cross-linguistically for reflexive constructions, in which
a participant acts upon himself, to be formed in a very similar way to
reciprocal constructions, in which two or more participants act upon
each other. Yimas departs from this tendency, however, for reflexive
and reciprocal constructions in this language actually have little in com­
mon. Yimas lacks any coherent way of forming reflexive constructions;
a number of seemingly ad hoc devices express this notion. For example,
a semantically reflexive verb may be monovalent, as with body action
verbs like 'bathe' or 'shave' (as in English),
(6-17) a. na-na-awukcpa-n
3SG S-DEF-bathe-PRES
'He is bathing (himself) .'
b. ama-na-wantk-n
1SG S-DEF-dress up-PRES
'I'm getting dressed up.'
or a normally bivalent verb may be used intransitively, with no overt
valence altering morpheme (again, as in English) .","[304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"
"BOUNDARIES AND THE NOTION OF THE WORD83Example (b) corresponds to (a) as negative to positive. Note that the
pronominal prefix p- in (a) appears as the corresponding suffix - m in
the negative example (b), as a result of its position being usurped by
the initial negative prefix ta-. Thus, we define the string flanked on
both sides by these affixes as a word, using the behavior of negation as
a grammatical criterion for determining words.
Unfortunately, this grammatical criterion is often at odds with pho­
nological ones. Consider this example with an incorporated nominal (S
marks the subject of an intransitive verb):
p-na-waca-k-m-ti-n
(2-23) mamam
sore VII SG VII SG S-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES
'The sore is getting smaller.'
waca-k-m small-IRR-VII SG is a derived nominal incorporated into the
verb and forming a grammatical unit with it (see Section 6.2.3. 1.3). This
is clearly demonstrated by the fact that when rule (2-23) is negated, the
usurped pronominal prefix p- becomes the suffix -m at the end of the
word, following the tense suffix -nt PRES.
(2-24) a. mamam
sore VII SG
ta-na-waca-k-m-ti-nt-m
NEG-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES-VII SG S
'The sore isn't getting smaller.'
*
b. mamam
sore VII SG
ta-na-waca-k-m-m-ti-n
NEG-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-VII SG S-become-PRES
Other pieces of evidence that this is a single grammatical word are
the behavior of valence-increasing prefixes. For example, if a causative
is derived from (2-23), the causative prefix tar- ""' tal- can precede the
incorporated nominal.
mamam
(2-25) marasin
medicine V SG sore VII SG
p-n-na-tar-waca-k-m-ti-n
VII SG 0-3SG A-DEF-CAUS-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES
'The medicine made the sore smaller.'
The whole sequence waca-k-m-ti- small-IRR-VII SG-become 'become
small' is causativized by tar- CAUS, again demonstrating that it func­
tions as a grammatical unit.
While the verbs in (2-23) and (2-24) are single words by grammatical
criteria, they are not so on phonological grounds. Consider the incor-84PHONOLOGYporated nominal waca-k-m small-IRR-VII SG again. Note that the class
and number concord marker appears as the word final allomorph - m
and not the word medial (and underlying) form -mp. This indicates a
word boundary between - m and the verb ti- 'become'. Stress patterns
also indicate two words, as the stress pattern for the verb in (2-23) is
p-na-waca-k-m-U-n, with both waca-k-n and ti- being assigned stress
independently (remember as discussed above, the pronominal prefixes
are unstressed and ignored by the stress rules when assigning stress) .
So on phonological criteria, the word would be represented as I# p­
na-waca-k-m # ti-n #I, while on grammatical criteria it would be I#
p-na-waca-k-m-ti-n #I. Clearly, this is contradictory, and in order to
solve this dilemma, it is necessary to appeal to two different notions of
word, a phonological word and a grammatical word. With the earlier
discussion of nouns and adjectives, this was not necessary, as the two
criteria types coincided (although in treating noun compounds a similar
distinction would need to be invoked in English as well as Yimas; see
Di Sciullo and Williams 1987) . But with verbs, this distinction is clearly
needed. Phonological words are those word units defined by phonological
criteria, while grammatical words are those determined by grammatical
criteria. Units defined as words in Yimas by the segmental phonological
rules and stress rules are phonological words; I will henceforth use the
word boundary symbol to indicate the boundaries of phonological words.
Sequences which behave as integrated units with respect to grammatical
processes like valence changing and negative (among others) are gram­
matical words. The boundaries of grammatical words have no special
symbol. Rather, I will use the practical orthography to indicate these.
Sequences of verbal morphemes that I write as single words correspond
to grammatical words (they may, of course, also correspond to phono­
logical words), and the sub-word morphological units will be set off from
each other by hyphens.
Another interesting example of the contrast between phonological
and grammatical words involves the very common Yimas construction
of verb compounding or serialization, in which two or more verb roots
join to form a complex verb, as seen in examples such as these:
(2-26) a. urauknut
coconut meat IX PL
ura-mpu-ntak-mpi-]la-ntut
IX PL 0-3PL A-leave-SEQ-stay-RM PAST
'They left the coconut meat.'
b. mamparukat

V PL 0-3PL A-split-SEQ-break-SEQ-tie-PERF
'They split the branches, broke (them) and tied ( them) .'
Each of these verbs corresponds to more than one phonological word,
as shown by the number of primary stresses marked in each example.
Yet they each clearly correspond to one grammatical word. First of all,
negation applies to the verb as a whole, demoting the first pronominal
prefix to the end of the full sequence of morphemes.
( 2-27) a. uralJknut
coconut meat IX PL
ta-mpu-ntak-mpi-Jla-ntuk-ut
NEG-3PL A-leave-SEQ-stay-RM PAST-IX PL 0
'They didn't leave the coconut meat.'

ta-mpu-park-mpi-kapik-mpi-wark-ra
NEG-3PL A-split-SEQ-break-SEQ-tie-V PL 0
'They didn't split the branches, break ( them) and tie
(them ) .'
Further, valence increasing also applies to the verb compound as a whole.
Consider the examples above in ( 2-26 ) in combination with tav- COM,
indicating an action done for the benefit of someone present ( see Section
6.2.3.3 ) .
( 2-28 ) a. uralJknut

'They split branches, broke (them) and tied ( them) for me.'
Interestingly, it is in the area of compounds where nouns also show
a split between the phonological and grammatical word, albeit not as
extreme as that for the verbs. Yimas has a productive system of noun
eompounding employing the oblique ease suffix on the first member of
the compound, rather like the use of the genitive ease in German noun
compounds.","[104, 105, 106, 107]"

In the third person singular, the language makes a distinction between
what might be called proximative and obviative pronouns. The proxi­
mative form m- (the near distal deictic stem) is used when the possessor
is coreferential with a core argument in the clause, generally the subject,
while obviative na- is used when it is not.

This contrast is only found in the singular; to get the same distinction
in the other numbers, the normal possessor form must be modified by
the adjective ma 'other' to express unambiguously the non-coreferential
reading. Otherwise, the form remains ambiguous.

content to live with the ambiguity of ( 4-59a).
4.6 Nominals and Noun PhrasesFrom some of the above examples the alert reader will have noted two
constructions for possessor-possessed relations, illustrated again in the
following examples.

lSG POSS-V SG betelnut V SG
'my betelnut'NOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES181Superficially these two constructions only differ formally in the pres­
ence or absence of the possessive agreement suffix -kn, but syntactically
there is a world of difference between them. The construction without
the possessive agreement suffix for the noun class and number of the
possessed noun is a tightly knit noun phrase. Its word order is rigid and
nothing may intervene between the two constituents.
(4-61) a.*matn
ama-na
brother I SG lSG-POSS
b.*ama-na mpa-n matn
lSG-POSS one-I SG brother I SG
However, neither of these prohibitions apply to the construction with
the agreement suffix.
ama-na-kn

'my betelnut'
b. ama-na-kn
mpa-n patn
lSG-POSS-V SG one-V SG betelnut V SG
'my one betelnut'
In fact, when the possessor is suffixed with an agreement marker, any
word order is possible.

its other modifiers.

I f the possessed noun is understood from context, it need not even be
nwut.ioned.","[201, 202, 203]"
"Note that in all these possessor raising constructions, the entity actually
affected is the possessor, not the body part: it is the possessor's nervous
system which registers the effect. The body part is merely the locus at
which the event occurs and thus is properly coded as the T participant.
The semantics of the T participant in possessor raising constructions
closely parallels that of the T participant of such prototypically trivalent
verbs as tkam- 'show' and va- 'give' ( on the semantics of the theme role
generally, see Foley and Van Valin 1984, Chapter 2 ) . The D participant
of trivalent verbs, whether basic, as for va- 'give', or derived, as in ( 6-51 ) ,
properly codes the entity primarily affected by the action.
There is an interesting minor extension of possessor raising beyond
body parts to entities generally residing on or near the skin, and perhaps
viewed as inalienably possessed much like body parts ( 6-52a,b) , and also
to personal characteristics of a person like a name or a voice ( 6-52c ) .
Thus, the following are grammatical in Yimas:( 6-52 ) a. kuran
na-ka-tu-r-akn
louse V SG V SG T- 1SG A-kill-PERF-3SG D
'I killed his lice.' (on his own head )
b. na!Jkun

'I killed the mosquito on her.'
c. ta-mpu-ant-kia-k-nak-mpwi
NEG-3PL A-hear-NIGHT-IRR-3SG 0-talk T
'They didn't listen to her call.'
Treating mosquitoes and lice as body parts is a fascinating bit of eth-STEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES303nolinguistic data telling us something about the local living conditions
and how they mold concepts of the body and its space!
6.2.3.3 Promotion to Core
There are six different morphemes which are used to code the core ar­
gument status of a constituent which would otherwise have to be an
oblique noun phrase or appear in a separate clause. Each of these has
a somewhat different semantic function, and most betray a rather close
similarity to incorporated adverbials (see Section 6.3.2.1). At least two
of them, in fact , must be analyzed as simultaneously an incorporated
adverbial and a valence increasing prefix.
6.2.3.3.1 Comitative tav-. Comitative participants are those which par­
ticipate in an event as adjuncts together with its main performer and
do so at the same place and in the same time, e.g., John went with
Mary. In Yimas, comitative participants can be expressed in two ways:
as nominals promoted to core argument status by the prefix tav- COM,
or as oblique nominals marked by the postposition kantk 'with'.

clear. The balance of the evidence presented above seems to favor group­
ing Chambri with Yimas-Karawari, but Angoram is very problematic.
It shows many features which are uniquely its own. some it shares with
�furik-Kopar and some with Chambri-Yimas-Karawari. The followingTHE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERS34very tentative family tree of the Lower Sepik seems the most acceptable:

The Yimas language has never been studied before, so there was no
material to consult before I began work on it. The first field trip was
undertaken in 1977 and lasted seven months. Since then there have been
five additional shorter trips: 1978-9 (2 months) , 1981-2 (2 months),
1983-4 (2 months) , 1985-6 (3 months) , and 1988 (1 month) . The total
time spent in the field amounted to 17 months. The great bulk of that
time was devoted to the in depth study of Yimas, but the study of the
neighboring language Arafundi and other languages of the Lower Sepik
family for comparative purposes was also pursued.
By far the greater part of the language work in Yimas was conducted
with a single very fine informant, Stephen Yakayapan Mambi, a man now
( 1988) in his late thirties. He is far and away the best speaker of Yimas
in his age group, and indeed, has a richer and more sophisticated knowl­
edge of the language than most men twenty years his senior. He is also
exceptionally well versed in traditional Yimas lore and legends. This is
all due to the upbringing by his father, a very traditional man, already
in his late forties at the time of Stephen's birth, who had reached adult­
hood in the precontact time and spoke only a rudimentary Tok Pisin.
Stephen was very close to his father and as a child spent much of his
time with him, in contrast to the typical pattern of young Yimas boys,
who congregate in age groups and spend most of their time with each
other. As a result of his father's tutelage, Stephen has an exceptional
knowledge of his language and culture, and is sometimes referred to in
the village by people his age and younger as tumbuna man, literally
'ancestor man' , one familiar with the traditional life.
My other informants were two men now (1988) in their late twenties,
Pius Tapi and Paul A pi. They were the major sources of my information
on the somewhat regularized and simplified Yimas of younger speakers.
Pius and I worked together in my first 3 months of field work in 1977.
When I first went to Yimas, I could not speak Tok Pisin, and I neededSOURCES FOR THIS STUDY35to work with someone who spoke English. Pius had completed six years
of English language medium schooling and was very helpful in this tran­
sitional period. My sessions with Paul Api were in 1984. Paul's special
gift is the ability to elucidate the meanings of complex constructions
and propose alternative examples (a task Stephen Mambi has little pa­
tience with) . He is also the source of much of my data on changes in the
language among younger speakers.
There were a few other people, mostly older men in their fifties,
that I worked with sporadically. My sessions with them were almost
exclusively concerned with the recording and transcribing of traditional
legends. The man who stands out in this group is Bruno Yumbwi, who
taught me many valuable legends (really oral history), such as the story
concerning the migration of the Chambri and Murik. He is also the
source of my information on pidginized Yimas, the highly simplified and
conventionalized jargon derived from Yimas used in trading contacts
with the Arafundi speaking villages upriver (Foley 1988).
Most of the data in this grammar comes from spontaneous spoken
texts, narratives, conversations, or expository prose. Some examples
come from elicitation sessions, but these have all been carefully and
doubly checked with informants, as have even those coming from spon­
taneous texts. The texts were recorded on tape and then transcribed
with the informant, who constantly monitored my oral repetition of what
was on the tape. I also got good data from speaking with the villagers
in Yimas, as they would quite gleefully correct me whenever I made a
mistake! Elicitation sessions were mostly restricted to the collection of
paradigms and the like, but there were many of these, for, as the reader
will soon discover, the structure of the language required it.
The language being described here is essentially that of Yimas speak­
ers in their late thirties and older in 1988. Younger speakers show signif­
icant simplifications and regularizations in their speech, many of which
will be noted where relevant in the grammar. Very young speakers, un­
der seven, rarely know the language at all, having learned Tok Pisin as
their first language. It remains to be seen whether they will learn Yimas
later, but the long term prognosis for the language is not good. It is
very likely that in 30 years or so it would not prove possible to write a
grammar of the language described herein.","[55, 56, 57]"
"2PhonologyFor a Papuan language Yimas has a fairly complex phonology, with
a significant inventory of phonological rules, especially those involving
vowels. Many morphemes exhibit a number of different phonetic forms
depending on the environment in which they appear. In order to pro­
vide significant generalizations about these morphemes, it is necessary
to propose abstract underlying forms which are converted into their ac­
tually occurring phonetic forms in each environment by the operation
of phonological rules. Many of these phonological rules are general and
will be treated in this chapter; those rules which are restricted to one or
a few morphemes will be discussed when those morphemes are treated
in later chapters. I will be employing a theoretical framework in this
ehapter based loosely on autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith 1979), in
which phonological features are associated with the segments in a ba­
sic consonant-vowel phonotactic schema in a number of hierarchically
organized tiers (see, for example, Goldsmith 1985, on the treatment of
vowel harmony). I have also adapted some ideas of Kiparsky's ( 1982,
1985) framework of lexical phonology, which proposes that there are two
major types of phonological rules: lexical phonological rules, which are
internal to the lexicon and apply when new, lexically specified stems are
derived from roots by morphological derivational processes; and postlex­
ical phonological rules, which apply to all forms generated by the mor­
phological processes of the language, not just those which are lexically
specified. The form of this theory necessarily stipulates that lexical
phonological rules precede postlexical ones. The form of this theoreti­
cal framework and its usefulness in the analysis of Yimas will become
apparent as the description proceeds.
In this chapter I will follow the following conventions: a form en­
closed in slashes, i.e., /x/, denotes a systematic phonemic or underly­
ing morphophonemic form; a form enclosed in square brackets, i.e. , [x] ,
37PHONOLOGY38represents a systematic phonetic surface form; and any form in italics
indicates a taxonomic phonemic ('classical phonemic') representation.
2 . 1 Consonants
2.1.1 Segmental Phonemes
Yimas has one of the simplest phonological inventories of any Papuan
language. It has only twelve underlying consonantal phonemes, and even
three of these are suspect. The consonant phonemes are
ofour stops and their corresponding nasals for four places of artic­
ulation,
stop nasalp
bilabial
t
dental-apical
c
palatal-laminal
k
velar
o two liquids,
palatal lateral
apical rhotic
o and two semivowels,
high, front, unrounded
high, back, roundedm
n
Jl
lJ
lY
r
y
wIJll and llY I. These often arise by transparent phonological rules in­
The problematic underlying phonemes are the palatal sounds, lcl,volving the palatalization of an adjoining dental-apical consonant by a
high front vowel or semivowel: for example, kay 'canoe' + - nan LOC >
ka(y)p,an 'in the canoe' , and tay- 'see', reduplicated becomes tacay 'see
repeatedly, stare'. A number of older speakers pronounce lril instead
of llY or show variation between these two realizations. Clearly some
occurrences of the palatals must be regarded as derived from under­
lying dental-apical sounds. However, for those cases of palatals which
never show alternation with a dental-apical there seems no compelling
reason for treating these other than as underlying palatals. These are
always internal to stems, for with the exception of llY which can occur
finally, a palatal may not occur stem initially or finally. These stem
internal palatals, which never alternate with dental-apicals, are taken as
underlying palatals. Examples of these are akulY im 'wrist', ip,cit 'urine',
akipip,an 'behind', and wacakin 'small'. Not surprisingly, many of these
palatals correspond to dental-apicals plus high front vowels in the cog­
nates of the related language Karawari ( awkurim 'hand', sindi 'urine').
A stop and its corresponding nasal generally have the same articula­
tory position, but other than this they often exhibit a wide divergenceII,CONSONANTS39of articulatory features. This is because the stops have a rather wide
range of allophonic variation, while the nasals have very little.
The nasals have no audible allophonic variation and are always artic­
ulatorily realized with the phonetic quality of the conventional symbol
chosen to represent them. There is a tendency for younger speakers
to merge /n/ and /TJ/ in initial position. So, while older speakers say
[IJarwA] for varwa 'penis', many younger speakers would say [narwA] .
The only major allophonic rule concerning nasals syllabifies them in fi­
nal position after a homorganic stop ( iripm [frap0rp] 'coconut palm', patn
[phat0r;t] 'betelnut'), or word internally between two stops, at least one of
which must be homorganic ( yaracukvkwi [yarAsuk01Jgwi] 'white (PL)' ) .
Stops, on the other hand, are much more varied . Following nasals,
they are generally voiced, though this is optional (kumpwi [khumbwi]
'flying fox', - ntut [-ndut] RM PAST, ipcit [lJ1jlt] 'urine', pamki [pamgi]
'legs'). The stops also have voiceless aspirated allophones. These oc­
cur in initial position and before stressed vowels ( tikay [thakhay] 'nose',
pikam [phakham] 'skin of back', triv [th ra!J] 'tooth') . Finally, stops are
not orally released preceding a nasal ( iripm [frap0rp]] 'coconut palm',
watn [wat0r;t] 'ironwood', wacakv [wAsak0 V ] 'small', atmpi [at0r;tbi] 'cut­
ting'.
The peripheral stops /p/ and /k/ are also subject to allophonic rules
of lenition. /p/ is likely to be voiced before a high back vowel ( irpulY ik
[frbulYik] 'black ants', kuput [khG>but] 'rain') . Before a /w/, it is likely
to be both voiced and lenited to [�] (ipwa [i�a] 'you (PL) ' ) . Lenition
is even more common with /k/. Intervocalically before an unstressed
vowel, /k/ optionally becomes voiced and spirantized to hl ( wakintit
[wa1indit] 'snakes', amanakin [AmAna""{in] 1 SG POSS). In final sylla­
bles, this lenited /k/ often disappears completely with compensatory
vowel lengthening; so, for example, the second example above would be
pronounced [AmAna· n] .
The palatal-lamina! stop jcj has the most complex allophony of the
four stops. Intervocalically, it is often realized simply as the voiceless
slit dental fricative [s] , but this varies according to age, with younger
speakers preferring [s] , while older speakers prefer the palatal-lamina!

stem internally, never initially or finally, with a couple of exceptions like
arc 'grandparent'. This must be a borrowed word, because in addition
to the aberrant final / c / , the consonant cluster / rc / is also disallowed in
Yimas, as all such clusters must agree in palatality, i.e., Yimas demands
/lc/. The presence of both these aberrant features marks this word as
outside the normal system of Yimas phonology.
The palatalized lateral /lY / has two phonetic realizations, which are
seen in free variation: a strongly palatalized apical lateral [lY] or a
palatal-laminal lateral [i]. Examples are walY [wa<lY] ""' [wa<i] 'wind',
mikilY [makllY] ,....., [maklA] 'monitor lizard', and walY amuv [wa<lY AmG>IJ]
""' [wa<iAmG>IJ] 'basket'. Note that as in the above examples, vowels are
quite fronted preceding the phoneme flY / . This applies somewhat to
all palatal consonants, but is most apparent with /lY /. In some cases
the fronting of /a/ may be so pronounced that it becomes a low front
vowel or takes on the character of a diphthong ( walY amuv [w::eiY AmG>IJ]
""' [waylY AmG>IJ] 'basket').
The apical rhotic /r/ varies freely in most environments between
an apical lateral [1] and an alveolar tap [r] ( irak [ilak] ""' [irak] 'dance',
pramuv [phlamG>IJ] ""' [phramG>IJ] 'sleep') . But following the dental-apical
stop /t/, only the tap articulation is allowed ( triv [thrau] * [thlau] 'tooth',
amtra [amdrA] * [amdlA] 'food', trukwa [thrukwA] * [thlUkwA] 'knee').
Elsewhere, some speakers prefer one articulation over the other, but
there is no hard and fast rule, both being acceptable. The [1] articula­
tion is most favored intervocalically and the [r] elsewhere, but this is just
a tendency. /r/ may not occur word initially or finally and is subject
to some complex phonological rules which convert it to /t/ (see Section
2.3.2).
Yimas has two semivowels, a high front unrounded /y/ and a high
back rounded /w / . I have defined these in terms of vocalic features like
front rather than consonantal features like palatal, because as we shallCoNSONANTS41see, they interact in fundamental ways with the vowel system of Yimas.
I will therefore defer further discussion of these features until treating
vowels in Section 2.2.
The distinctive features of the consonants of Yimas are represented
in Table 3. Some of the features chosen may seem strange at this point,
but the reasons for their selection will become apparent as the vowel
system and phonological rules are presented. They have been chosen to
provide the maximally simple and transparent statement of the phono­
logical rules. Henceforth, I will represent the palatal lateral phoneme
llY I simply as Ill.
2.1.2 Consonant Clusters
At the phonetic level, initial and final consonant clusters in Yimas are
strongly constrained, but they are rather freer word-medially. Yimas
words can begin in a vowel (gvkayapan 'afternoon', !Jtcit 'urine') or
any consonant other than lrl or the palatals lcl, IJll or 111. Clusters
of no more than two consonants can begin a word. The permissible
combinations are any stop (other than lcl) plus lrl (pramuv 'sleep',
kiv 'tooth', kramnawt 'three') or IP, kl plus lw I (pwipciniv 'cross
beams', kwarkwa 'today'). Finally, initial clusters of homorganic nasal
plus stop are permitted ( mpum 'large crayfish', vkak 'go'). Palatal nasal
plus stop initial clusters are, of course, prohibited by the general ban on
initial palatals.
This last possibility might be seen to argue for unit phonemes of pre­
nasalized voiced stops, abrogating the need to posit these ad hoc lmpl
initial clusters. There are a number of arguments against this analysis.
First of all, as pointed out in Section 2.1.1, homorganic nasal plus stop
clusters following another stop are realized with the nasal as syllabic.
This would be very difficult to account for if the entire cluster nasal
plus stop were a unit phoneme. Second, non-homorganic nasal plus
stop clusters are common in the language, such as namtampara 'foot' or
manpa 'crocodile'. The language provides no evidence for distinguish­
ingnon-homorganic nasal plus stop clusters from homorganic ones, and
it is simplest to treat all as clusters. Third, the language has a highly
productive rule of nasal truncation, reducing sequences of nasals to one,
which is simplest to state if the nasals are always treated as separate seg­
ments (see Section 2.3.5), as in pamuvk+i > [pamgi], where the cluster
lm+ul reduces to [m]. Finally, I have been able to discover fewer than
ten stems in the entire language which begin in nasal plus stop clusters,
the great majority of which begin in lmpl. There is only one example
of Inti and one of lukl, and both are verb stems normally preceded by
prefixes. This set of stems with initial nasal plus stop clusters is42PHONOLOGYImpI: mpan 'one', mpa 'now, already', mpum 'large crayfish',
mpunawv 'elbow', mpuvkan 'crowned pigeon',
mpivam 'navel', mpatnpara 'few', mpimtak 'cross river'
Int i : ntakik 'leave'
IIJkl: vkak 'go by land'
This small inventory is much more in keeping with an analysis of these
as initial consonant clusters, all examples of which are quite rare, rather
than as a single initial consonant.
In summary, Yimas words can begin with up to two consonants,
summarized in the following formula:
# ( C1 ) ( C2 ) V
Both consonants are optional, i.e., a word can begin in a vowel. If (C2
is missing, then C1 may be any consonant except the palatals and lrf).
If cl and c2 are both present, only the following three possibilities are
allowed:
( a) C1 = non-palatal stop
c2 = lrl
(b ) c1 = IP , k l
c2 = lwl
(c ) C1 = nasal
c2 = homorganic stop
Permissible final clusters are even more restricted. Yimas words can
end in vowels: manpg, 'crocodile', awakj 'stars'. They can also end in
any consonant except the palatals lcl and IJll (Ill may end a word) ,
and IrI. The only final consonant clusters allowed are a stop plus a
homorganic nasal (always syllabic as discussed in Section 2.1.1) ( iripm
'coconut palm' patn 'betelnut' and wasakv 'small' ) . The finals of Yimas
words can be summarized in the following formula:
V( C1 ) ( C2 ) #Medial clusters are much more varied than both initials and finals.
Clusters of up to three consonants are permitted in this position. All
Yimas consonants can occur intervocalically, but need not occur, as
vowel clusters are allowed (kiav 'cough') . Medial clusters of two elements
are of three types, depending on the initial consonant. Yimas does not
permit geminates; so, for example, clusters of nasal plus nasal may not
be homorganic.
Type 1: C1C2 where C1 = nasal and
c2 = stop:

C2 = nasal: (/1/ only with /Jl/ and */rn/): narmav 'woman',
walpakin 'light'
c2 = semivowel (only /rw/): varwa 'penis'
but not *C2 = liquid
Medial clusters of three consonants are much more restricted. Most
of those involve a nasal plus stop cluster. The first type of cluster with
three consonants is a nasal plus stop cluster, followed by a liquid or
semivowel,
Type 1: c1C2C3 where cl = nasal, c2 = stop, and
awantrim 'cassowaries (DL) ', numpran
c3 = /rf:
-- 'pig',
tantayvkraym 'spider'
tumpwik 'yellow', nuvkwara 'hand'
Examples in which C3 = /w/ require the nasal and stop to be homorganic
and peripheral (i.e., labial or velar).
Type 2: C1C2C3 where C2 = peripheral nasal, C3 = peripheral stop,
and
ilvk apuk 'go down', alvkat 'machete (PL) ',
cl = liquid:
tikirvkat 'chair (PL) '
cl = stop:
matpci 'bird (sp) ', atnpi 'cutting',
yaracikvki 'white'
The medial nasals in these last cluster types are always syllabic, as
discussed in Section 2.1.1. Other clusters of three consonants are formed
with /r/ followed by a stop,
Type 3: C1 C2C3 where C1 = /r/, C2 = peripheral stop and
C3 = nasal
irpmul 'two coconut palms'
kwarkwa 'today', tarpwa 'belly'
c3 = /w/:
Combining the statements of permissible consonant clusters in initial,PHONOLOGY44medial and final position, we may state that a Yimas word has the
following consonant-vowel (CV) skeletal structure:
(2-1) # ( C1 )( C2 ) V1 ( [ ( C 3) C 4 ( C 5W) V2 ( C6)( C 7) #where the constraints on the initial, medial and final clusters are those
described above. Both affixes and roots conform to this CV skeletal
structure. According to this skeleton, the simplest Yimas word would be
a vowel, and there is such a form, the verb stem i- 'say'. The superscript
over the medial syllable allows it to iterate this syllable a number of
times to produce syllables of more than two syllables. The longest roots
are around five or six syllables, for example mamantakarman 'land crab'
or tivkimpipawa 'bird (sp) '; but words can be much longer, as in these
tongue twisters: navanavkanampanira 'you all give those to them few'
or kampupaymatakatnampanim 'let them paint them all inside first'.
Syllabification in Yimas is generally transparent. If a single con­
sonant occurs between two vowels, the syllable boundary precedes it
(V.CV ) . With clusters of two consonants, it falls between the two con­
sonants
VC1 .C2V) , unless C1
stop and C2 /r/, in which case it
precedes (the cluster (V.C1 C2 V) . For clusters of three consonants, the
syllable boundary follows the first consonant (VC1 .C2C3V) .
n==In terms of phonetic contrasts, Yimas presents a system of four vowels,
/i/, /i/, /u/, and /a/ as documented by the following minimal pairs:
mum 'they', mim 'it', mam 'another', mi 'you( SG ) '; pikriv 'fart', pikriv
'mouth'. However, a simple list of minimal pairs such as these dis­
guises some important facts about the Yimas vowel system. Not all
these vowels are equally common. Together /i/ and /a/ account for
the overwhelming percentage of vowel tokens in Yimas, over 90%, with
/u/ coming next and /i/ decidedly rare, perhaps 1%-2% of all vowel
tokens. Furthermore, /i/ and /a/ have extensive allophonic variation,
varying widely over the vowel space, but /u/ and especially /i/ have a
very narrow range.","[57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66]"

It is important to note that verbs like kacapal- 'forget' and yavkuravtakal
'think, remember' only take obligatorily controlled complements in one
of their uses, that corresponding to the equivalent English verbs with
infinitive complements, e.g., forget/remember/think to eat. In Yimas,
constructions parallel to English that clause complements, such as for­
get/remember/thought that she ate, there is no issue of control. Compare
these examples with (7-52b,c):
(7-53) a. pia-ka-kacapal

'I think that the woman brought a basket.'
Yimas does not possess embedded that clauses like English. The struc­
tures in (7-53) are again paratactic. The clauses are just juxtaposed:
one is not embedded in the other. The two clauses can occur in either
order. Unlike (7-52b) in which the complement is linked to the pronom­
inal prefix pia- 'talk' on the matrix verb as a nominal in apposition to
it, the juxtaposed clauses in (7-53) are linked together as equals. The
second clause does not bear an appositional relationship to the prefix
pia- 'talk' in (7-53), but to the clause as a whole. So, (7-53a) roughly
might be paraphrased as 'I forgot (some) talk/idea: you got betelnut'.
Perhaps a more natural English sentence with a similar structure would
be: I forgot: did you get betelnut or not? Note that, as mentioned
briefly above, thought is treated as language. Thinking is conceived by
the Yimas as simply internal talking. The semantic contrast in Yimas
between a nominalized complement and a juxtaposed clause with 'think'
and 'forget' is very much like that between the English equivalents of an
infinitive complement versus a that clause. The nominalized complement
expresses an event which should have occurred or failed to occur, as a
result of the cognitive act denoted by the matrix verb. The juxtaposed
clause, on the other hand, encodes an event which either occurred or
failed to occur, but which the cognitive act denoted by the matrix verb398INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONShad no role in effecting. The matrix verb simply registers the content of
the consciousness of the A participant with respect to that event.
Turning now to trivalent verbs in which the complement functions
as T, it is immediately apparent that these represent the most complex
case, for now either the A or D participant of the matrix verb is eligible
as controller. Which of these is the controller is determined by the
semantics of the matrix verb, in exactly the way the universal theory
of control presented in Foley and Van Valin (1984, 307-11) predicts.
Complement-taking trivalent verbs which denote directive speech acts,
i.e., attempts by the speaker to get the addressee to do something, always
have the D participant as controller; otherwise the controller is the A.
The verb roots i- 'tell' and kankantakal- 'ask' are the prototypical verbs
expressing directive speech acts, in Yimas and in other languages. Both
of these have D participant control.

b. impram
pay-cu-mpwi na-kra-kankantakal
basket VII SG carry-NFN-talk 3SG A-IPL D-ask
'He asked us to carry a basket.'
The only way to avoid obligatory D control with directive verbs like i­
'tell' is not to use a complement structure at all, but to employ a jux­
taposed structure like those of (7-53) with the equivalent of the comple­
ment expressed as a direct quote. (Yimas like many Papuan languages
lacks indirect speech constructions.) Compare (7-55) with (7-54a):
(7-55) pia-mpu-ua-i
""ipa tpuk
am-u ""
talk T-3PL A-ISG D-tell IPL sago X SG eat-IRR
'They told me: ""We want to eat sago."" '
In (7-55), ipa 'me' in the direct quote is, of course, coreferential with the
A participant of the matrix verb, mpu- 3PL A, not the D, va- ISG D.
The same remarks concerning the structure of juxtaposed clauses made
above with respect to (7-53) apply to (7-55) as well.
Trivalent verbs which do not denote directive speech acts have A
participant control. Contrast these examples with (7-54):

Here, the complement verb consists of a verb theme formed by a serial
verb construction consisting of two verb roots, yara- 'pick up' and wul­
'put down'.
7.1.3 Purpose Clauses
Purpose clauses share a number of the grammatical properties of com­
plements, but contrast with the latter in that they never function as a
core argument of the matrix verb. Rather, they function somewhat like
oblique constituents of the matrix verb, expressing the intended goal of
the action of the matrix verb. Purpose clauses are like complements in
that they are non-finite: they never occur with pronominal agreement
affixes or true tense suffixes (only the irrealis suffix) . Purpose clauses are
always controlled: the A or S of a purpose clause can never be overtly
expressed and is always coreferential with a human core argument of the
matrix verb. Normally this is the S or A participant, but if the verb has
more than one human participant, it is possible for the 0 or D to be the
controller. ( See example ( 7-61c) below. ) The verb in a purpose clause
is marked by the irrealis suffix -k ""' -vk, as in these examples:
( 7-61 ) a. rna IJarlJ
wa!Jkia
awl-k

taiJkway-cakal-k
VIS-grasp-IRR
'It was the women who sent me to look after the children.'
In ( 7-61a,b) the matrix verbs are monovalent verbs of motion with only
an S participant, which is then the controller of the purpose clause. NoteNON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS403further the presence of -kia in both the matrix verb and that of the pur­
pose clause. Its presence on both verbs is obligatory. True complements
diverge here in prohibiting -kia. Example (7-61c) has a bivalent main
verb with two human arguments, an A, vaykum 'women', and an 0, va­
lSG 0. The controller of the purpose clause must be the 0 participant:
witness the above translation. (7-61c) cannot have A control (*'it was
the women who sent me so that they could look after the children').
The irrealis suffix -k ,...., -vk is the general and common marker of
purpose clauses, but in one specific context there is an alternative to it.
If the act denoted by the purpose clause is to be carried out directly and
immediately as the result of a directive speech act, such as a request or
an order, then the marker for a complement of speech - mpwi 'talk' plus
the immediate aspect clitic mpan IMM may be used. Compare (7-62)
with (7-61c) above:
(7-62) !Jaykum
m-IJa-wampak-c-um
kumpwi
woman II PL NR DIST-lSG 0-throw-PERF-3PL child I PL
ta!Jkway-cakal-cu-mpwi mpan
IMM
VIS-grasp-NFN-talk
'It was the women who sent me to look after the children.'
Examples (7-61c) and (7-62) are very close in structure and meaning.
They structurally contrast in that (7-61c) has the irrealis suffix -k ,...., -vk
while (7-62) has the form of a complement with -ru NFN plus - mpwi
'talk' and the clitic mpan IMM. The meaning difference is that (7-62)
requires an immediately prior verbal order or request to someone that
they look after the children. This is not the case in (7-6lc); although
this scenario is possible, others are also, such as an arrangement made
days earlier or a pre-established custom that one does regularly. It
needs to be noted that not all speakers make this contrast. For some
speakers the contrast is one of immediacy; for them purpose clauses in
-mpwi mpan need to follow directly from the action of the matrix verb.
Other speakers seem to use the two ways of forming purpose clauses
interchangeably. And even some speakers who make it in some contexts
do not make it in others. It appears to be a semantic distinction well on
its way to being lost.
7.1.4 Non-Finite Relative Clauses
Yimas has two types of constructions corresponding to English relative
clauses. A relative clause is a clause-level construction (or more formally,
an S) which modifies a noun, such as the dog [which chased the cat] , in
which the relative clause which chased the cat modifies the noun dog ,
generally called the head of the relative clause. This relative clause404INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSis embedded as a constituent within the whole noun phrase, so that
the constituent structure is [the dog [which chased the cat]] . Both of
the Yimas relative clause types differ from English relative clauses in
that they are never embedded, but are simply nominalized forms of
verbs appositionally linked to a noun they modify, their 'head noun',
rather like juxtaposed possessive nominals. The two types of relative
clauses in Yimas contrast as to whether they are tensed or not. Non­
finite relative clauses are prohibited from occurring with tense suffixes
and instead have - ru NFN plus one of the set of suffixes which mark
agentive nominalizations (for head nouns referring to humans) or one
of the possessive/adjectival concord suffixes (for non-humans). Finite
relative clauses, which will be discussed in detail in Section 7.2.1, are
formed with or without the stem m- NR DIST, but require a true tense
suffix. This difference correlates closely with a meaning difference. Non­
finite relative clauses denote traits or characteristic actions of the noun
modified, while finite relative clauses denote states which hold or actions
which occur within the time frame denoted by the tense suffix on their
verbs. Consider this contrast in the following examples:
(7-63) a. namarawt [awt pampay-kulan-t-awt]
person I SG fire KIN-walk-NFN-M SG
'the person who tends the fire' (as his job)
b. namarawt [awt m-na-pampay-kulana:u]
person I SG fire NR DIST-DEF-KIN-walk
'the person who is tending the fire' (right now, others may
do so at other times)
The glosses in (7-63) clearly bring out the meaning contrast between the
non-finite (7-63a) and the finite (7-63b) relative clauses. The non-finite
relative clause expresses a long duration characteristic action, hence the
reading of the action as a job, while the finite relative clause denotes
the action as occurring within the time frame of the tense suffix, 'right
now', as the tense in (7-63b) is present imperfective. A similar contrast
can be found with states.
(7-64) a. namarawt [tamana
ti-r-awt]
na-mal
person I SG sickness IX SG feel-NFN-M SG 3SG S-die
'The person who was always sick died.'
b. namarawt [tamana
kantk-n] na-mal
person I SG sickness IX SG with-I SG 3SG S-die
'The sick person died.'
The non-finite relative clause in (7-64a) denotes a typical characteristic
state. The copula anak COP 3SG has been deleted in (7-64b), leaving
just the postpositional phrase inflected with the concord suffix - n I SGNON-FINITE N OMINALIZATIONS405as the finite relative clause (the copula could be inserted, but it is better
to omit it). Again, the finite relative clause is bounded in time, denoting
a temporary, transitory state of illness.
The syntax of non-finite and finite relative clauses is nearly identical
and because the latter are the more common type, I will discuss the
syntax of relative clauses in detail in Section 7.2.1. The one significant
difference between the two types is in the range of core argument posi­
tions which are relativizable (Keenan and Comrie 1977). The relativized
noun is that obligatorily missing argument of the relative clause which
must be coreferential with the noun modified, the 'head'. Any core ar­
guments plus locationals and temporals are relativizable with a finite
relative clause, but the relativized nouns in non-finite relative clauses
are restricted to S or A arguments. This is readily explicable, because
non-finite relative clauses are nothing but agentive nominalizations in
apposition to some nominal (the 'head noun'). Hence the noun which
they relativize must belong to the same general class as agentive nom­
inalizations, i.e., either S or A. Interestingly, as ( 7-65c) shows, it is
possible to use a non-finite relative clause to relativize a nominal which
is a non-agentive S. Examples of non-finite relative clause are provided
below:

A slight morphological peculiarity of non-finite relative clauses (one
they share with non-finite oblique clauses to be discussed in the next406INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSsection) concerns singular class III and V nouns functioning as 'heads'.
Instead of the expected concord suffix -n III/V SG in this case, what
is actually found is the agentive nominalization suffix - awt M SG, as in
this example:
(7-66) kakam

In addition to the positive non-finite relative clauses exemplified thus
far, Yimas also possesses negative non-finite relative clauses, which ex­
press the lack of a state or characteristic action. These are formed with
the postposition - kakan 'without' which behaves morphologically like the
attributive kantk- 'with'. (See example (7-64b)), except that it uses the
agentive nominalization suffixes for human 'head' nouns. There is even
a further exception to this last generalization: for the singular of classes
I, III, and V, -kakan actually uses a zero morpheme, rather than either
the expected - awt M SG or - n I, III, V SG.) Consider these examples:
(7-68) a. wik
mpa-n [yaki
am-kakan-mat]
week V SG one-V SG tobacco eat-without-M PL
na-kay-caw-ntut
V SG 0-lPL A-sit-RM PAST
'We stayed one week without smoking tobacco.'
(This is an interesting example with the normally monovalent verb being
used transitively, with two pronominal agreement prefixes.)

"THE OBLIQUE SUFFIX -nrv- n an165In addition to these minor class nouns, there are two sets of agree­
ment affixes which have no overt noun corresponding to them. These
are given below:
ADJ/POSS
VERB
-mpwi
pia­
'talk, words, language'
-nti
'actions, deeds'
tiaThe affixes for 'talk, words, language' may possibly go back to the affixes
for a now non-existent plural form * karmpi from karm 'lip, language',
but that is of little help in the synchronic analysis. Both of these af­
fixes sets are heavily used in the system of Yimas complementation (see
Section 7.1.2) and are a pervasive feature of natural discourse. Some
examples follow:
( 4-30) a. pia-k
ama-na-mpwi yua-mpwi apiak
talk-PROX lSG-POSS-talk good-talk COP talk
'This talk of mine is good.'
b. tia-n
mama-nti antiak
action-FR DIST bad-action COP action
'That action is bad.'
c. ma-mpwi pia-:ua-i
other-talk talk-lSG D-say
'(He) said something else to me.'
Finally, Table 4 provides a summary of the basic morphology of classes
I through X.
4.2 The Oblique Suffix - n """" -nanThis is the single nominal case marker in Yimas and is used to mark a
range of peripheral, adverbial-like case uses, such as instruments, loca­
tives and temporals.

PASTThis analysis of relative clauses, headed by m- NR DIST is further
supported by the behavior of those without m-. Because they lack m-, it
is impossible to argue that they are headed by anything but the concord
suffix. This claim is buttressed by the fact that finite relative clauses
without m- take exactly the same concord suffixes as adjectives or pos­
sessives. The suffix - nak 3SG 0 which marks role as well as person and
number in relative clauses with m- is not available for those without
it. This indicates that the final suffixes in relative clauses without m­
are just concord suffixes, like those terminating juxtaposed adjectives or
possessives, and not pronominal affixes to the verb. Thus, the m- less
relative clause in (7-102a) has the structure in (7-102b):
(7-102) a. wul-k-n
put down-IRR-V SG
'the thing put down'

can never be more than a verb theme (generally just a verb root) plus
a tense suffix (including - kia ) . No pronominal prefixes nor nominal ar­
guments are permitted. These constructions are very much parallel to
English nominalized adjectives or participles in - ed such as the dead or
the cooked. These finite relative clauses without m- NR DIST are the
patient-oriented counterpart to the agentive nominalizations. Whereas
agentive nominalizations denote the agent or effective cause of an ac­
tion, these patient-oriented nominalizations describe the object affected
or produced by the action. Note these semantic contrasts between the
two nominalizations, using the same verb roots.

As mentioned earlier, agentive nominalizations operate on a nominative­
accusative basis in that the participant role played by the derived nom­
inal with respect to the verb root must be S or A. Patientive nominal­
izations conversely are ergative-absolutive in orientation, for the derived
nominal holds an S, 0, T, or even oblique role to the verb root, but
never A or, indeed, D. Compare the following patterns of derivations.
