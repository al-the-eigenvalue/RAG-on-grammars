"9A grammar of YurakaréThe noun phrase normally consists of a noun and optionally has modifying
elements as well (possessors, adjectives, numerals, quantifiers and articles).
Numerals, quantifiers and articles precede the noun; adjectives, as exemplified in
example (4) below, and possessors can be on either side of the head noun.
Modifiers can furthermore be extracted from the noun phrase:
(2)bëmë
wojto‐ø
ti‐tëbë
much/many
pour.out‐3 1SG‐blood
‘Much of my blood is pouring out.’ [AA‐9MA‐6]Possession is marked on the head by means of a cross‐referencing personal prefix,
as can be observed in example (2) above. The noun marked for possession is
usually preceded (but it may also be followed) by the possessor noun phrase:
(3)shunñe a‐pojore
man
3SG.P‐canoe
‘the man’s canoe’Number and case relations are marked by means of postpositional enclitics, which
attach to the rightmost element of the noun phrase. The postpositions marking
case relations mark the more peripheral relations: comitative, instrument, location,
direction and ablative. There is also a postpositional enclitic marking an emphatic
subject. All of this is exemplified in (4). Here it can also be observed that the clitic
status of the plural marker is somewhat doubtful, as it can appear optionally and
in addition to marking the final element, on non‐final elements as well.

‘The woman clubs the man with a big broom.’ (GB‐1MI‐99)Yurakaré is an accusative language, with some ergative characteristics, restricted
to a very small number of verbs. Subjects are suffixed to the verb, objects are
prefixed. Yurakaré predicate roots are either intransitive or transitive. These basic
valencies can be extended to maximally three head‐marked arguments with the
help of an elaborated system of five different applicatives (comitative, co‐
operative, objective, indirect object and affected object). Examples of such verb
roots with extended valency are the following:10Introduction(5)abti‐ma‐n‐kaya‐ma
1SG‐3PL‐IO‐give‐IMP.SG
‘Give them to me!’
ti‐ma‐la‐che‐m
1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐2SG.S
‘You ate them from me.’The entities referred to by the cross‐reference affixes in (5) may additionally be
expressed by overt noun phrases, but this is not required. The utterances in (5) are
perfectly grammatical sentences. Yurakaré, in other words, is a pro‐drop
language.
Many temporal, modal and aspectual distinctions are marked by means of
suffixes, which come right after valency changing morphology (the middle voice
marker and causative, which are suffixed), but before the person markers. This
taken together with the object cross‐referencing prefixes and applicative markers
discussed above complete the template of the Yurakaré verb:
(6)object cross ref. ‐ applicatives ‐ root ‐ valency ‐ TMA ‐ subject cross ref.","[24, 25, 26]"
"3.1 Introducing Yurakaré morphology
From the perspective of morphological typology, Yurakaré can be characterized as
an agglutinating language. In the ideal case of an agglutinating language “a word
may consist of more than one morpheme, but the boundaries between morphemes
in the word are always clear‐cut” (Comrie 1989a:43). This characterization fits
Yurakaré morphology to a high degree. There is some fusion, however, especially
within the system of participant reference on the verb. Here the categories of
person and number are fused, and sometimes also semantic function (e.g. in the
cross‐referencing system, cf. section 5.1). On the whole, however, Yurakaré
morphology provides us with a fairly straightforward picture of an agglutinating
language.
On another dimension, isolating versus polysynthetic, Yurakaré can be placed
more towards the polysynthetic end, as was suggested already by the morpheme
per word ratio. I take polysynthetic to mean the possibility “to combine a large
number of morphemes, be they lexical or grammatical, into a single word,
corresponding to a sentence of English” (Comrie 1989a:45). Yurakaré, with its
elaborate person reference system and applicatives (cf. sections 5.1 and 5.2) fits
this description. To give an example, consider the following:
(1)abti‐ma‐y‐mala‐ma
1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG
‘Go and get them for me!’ [AA‐15MA‐9]
ti‐ma‐la‐che‐ø
1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐3
‘He ate them from me (e.g. from my plate).’ [MV‐14MA‐26]I have not counted zero morphemes and I have counted bound roots + required
derivational morphemes as one. I did count enclitics. The total number of words was 6,976,
the total number of morphemes 14,289.",[62]
"3.2.2 Suffixing, prefixing, and infixing
As mentioned, Yurakaré has both prefixes and suffixes. The categories associated
with prefixes and suffixes are roughly as follows:
Table 12 ‐ categories of prefixes and objects
prefixessuffixesobject cross‐reference
object‐oriented valency
aspect
derivationsubject cross‐reference
subject‐oriented valency
tense, mood, aspect
derivationThe order of bound morphemes is fixed in Yurakaré, corresponding to their scope,
as well as to the distinction between derivation and inflection. By derivational
morphemes I mean morphemes that “form new words either by changing the
meaning of the base to which they are attached (…) or by changing the word‐class
that a base belongs to” (Katamba 1993:47). “Inflectional morphemes are only able
to modify the form of a word so that it can fit in a particular syntactic slot”
(Katamba 1993:51).
In the following examples, we can see that inflection is generally found more
towards the edge of a word, while derivation is closer to the root. Consider first:51A grammar of Yurakaré(14) aana‐kka‐ø=tika‐l‐i‐sibë‐ø
3SG‐AFO‐VBL‐house‐3
‘When he was this big, she made him a house.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)
tütü‐mashi‐ø=w=ya
sit‐LD‐3=PL=NVR
‘They stayed a little.’ (AR‐8MI‐60)DEM‐MEA‐3=DSbIn (14)a, there are several derivational affixes. On the demonstrative pronoun ana,
there is a derivational element deriving a measure ‘this size’. This derivation also
changes the word class, turning it into an adjectival element, used as a predicate
here. The derivational element is followed by a zero morpheme. I will argue for
the existence of this zero morpheme in section 3.2.5 below. In the same section, I
will discuss enclitics, of which =ti is an example. The second (main) predicate in
(14)a has its cross‐referencing object morpheme ka‐ leftmost, more towards the
verb root, we find the derivational elements l‐ (shortened form of la‐) ‘affected
object’‐applicative and i‐ ‘verbalizer’. The prefix la‐ (or l‐ before a vowel) is an
applicative prefix which increases the valence of a verb, which, in this case, has the
role of beneficiary. The prefix i‐ is a category‐changing prefix, deriving verbs from
nouns. In (14)b, the verb root is followed by a derivational element ‐mashi, which
indicates that the event is carried out to a limited degree (a little), followed by the
subject marker ‐ø and the plural morpheme =w.
As far as tense, mood and aspect are concerned, the order seems to follow the
relevance principle (Bybee 1985), which says that an affix is placed closer to the
root the more relevant it is to the meaning of the root from a cognitive point of
view.
The only tense marker ‐shta ‘future tense’ is found before the subject markers, as
is event‐related modality and aspect 5. Modality and aspect that is more
propositional related (epistemic) or related to expressive and interactional motives
of the speaker are external to the person markers (cf. sections 7.1 and 7.2)
Infixing is a marginal process in Yurakaré. A first possible example of this is a
variant of the imperative singular (cf. section 6.3.5) marker <‐n‐> (with allomorph
[m]) with verbs that start with the vowel /i/. Examples of infixing of this type often
involve roots that seem to be complex in one way or another; hence we may not be
dealing with infixing after all:The only prefixed aspectual markers a‐ ‘incompletive and i‐ ‘verbal plural’ either replace
object prefixes (in the case of incompletive a‐) or they merge with the object markers (in the
case of verbal plural i‐).","[66, 67]"

REF‐DEM‐MEA‐SINCE
‘From that time onwards…’This suffix can be decomposed into ‐sh, ‐ba and ‐che. The suffix ‐shi normally derives an
adverb from an adjective or noun, and ba‐che is a verb that means ‘to send’. This verb
has a non‐causative counterpart ba‐ta ‘to go’, with the middle marker ‐tA.
i‐ ‘verbalizer’
Since nouns and adjectives can occur in predicative position (cf. section 3.3.3), there is
not much need for verbalizing morphology. There is one verbalizing prefix, however: i‐
. Addition of this prefix triggers the interpretation ‘to have X’:

ultimately be the possession of the maker, in (108)d the subject gets water that will be
in his possession. The example in (108)e, finally, can be rephrased as ‘he has language,
he has the word’.
‐jta ‘smell’
The suffix ‐jta on a noun means that it smells like what is expressed in the noun:

The suffix ‐shku on a noun, often followed by the middle marker ‐tA, derives an adverb
from a noun, and can be translated as ‘like X’:

‘He appeared to her as a Yurakaré.’ (AR‐8MI‐3)The form ‐shku is probably decomposable into ‐sh and ‐ku. The element ‐sh is found on
adjectives to form manner adverbs; ‐ku is harder to interpret, but it may be that it is the127A grammar of Yurakaréku‐ which denotes cooperative object third person (cf. section 5.2.2). The verb ta ‘say’,
which is probably the source for the middle marker ‐tA, takes the cooperative object
applicative form to mark addressees.
First and second person pronouns can take the adverbializer ‐shku as well as ‐sh, but
if they do, they take an intervening morpheme ‐wa:

Apart from the subclassification of nouns proper on the basis of number and collective
marking (cf. section 4.2), the class of nouns can be further subdivided into a number of
subclasses. First, we can distinguish pronouns. There are three types of pronouns:
demonstrative, personal and the question word ama.
Personal pronouns
There are four personal pronouns in Yurakaré:
(112) sëë
mëë
tuwa
paaI
you (sg)
we
you (pl)There is no inclusive/exclusive distinction for first person plural. Third person
pronouns are indicated by demonstrative pronouns, which will be discussed later in
this section. Personal pronouns are distinguished from other nouns firstly on the basis
of plural marking. They are the only nominal forms that have suppletive plural forms.
Second, as mentioned in 4.4.4, personal pronouns behave differently when the
adverbializer ‐shku is added, cf. example (111). Furthermore, they are restricted with
respect to derivational morphology. The only derivational affixes that I have found on
personal pronouns are limitative ‐jti and adverbializer ‐shku(ta). Personal pronouns
cannot be possessed either. Yurakaré is a pro‐drop language, so personal pronouns can
be left out. This will be discussed in section 8.1.","[140, 141, 142, 143]"
"4.3 Postpositional clitics
The marking of grammatical relations in Yurakaré is a mixed system of head (cf.
sections 5.1 and 5.2) and dependent marking. Less central participants are usually
dependent marked by means of postpositional clitics. Yurakaré has the following
postpositional markers:
(41) =tina
=la
=y
=chi
=jshacomitative
instrument
locative
direction
ablativeI consider these markers to be postpositions rather than case markers for two reasons.
First, Payne (1997:100) describes case markers and adpositions as two extremes of a
continuum ranging from marking central participants (case) to marking more
peripheral participants (adpositions):106The noun phraseCase marking is the morphosyntactic categorization of noun phrases
that is imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase
occurs. Adpositions are free of such configurational constraints.
The markers in (41) mark non‐central (non‐obligatory) participants; therefore they are
on the adpositional side of Payne’s continuum. Second, there is another way to make
the distinction between case markers and adpositional markers: “Adpositions can be
considered analytic case markers as opposed to synthetic case markers like the suffixes
of Turkish or Latin” (Blake 2001:9). The adpositions in Yurakaré are phrasal enclitics,
attaching to the rightmost element of the noun phrase (cf. section 3.2.5), therefore they
are analytic markers rather than synthetic:
(42) abinele
elle=y
inside
earth=LOC
‘inside the ground’
elle inele=y4.3.1 =tina comitative
The central relation =tina encodes is the comitative, having the same role in the
predication as a core participant (subject or direct object). The comitative participant is
less topical than the core participant.

shunñe a‐ye=tina
li‐tütü‐ø
a‐sibë=y
DEM armadillo man
3SG.P‐sister=COM DEL‐sit;be‐3 3SG.P‐house=LOC
‘That armadillo‐man was in his house with his sister.’ (AY‐2NC‐3)The roles of the core participant and the comitative object do not have to be exactly
parallel:
(44) yupa‐ø‐ya
a‐mumuy
a‐ballata=tina
go.in.SG‐3=NVR 3SG.P‐all
3SG.P‐seed=COM
‘He went in with all of his seeds.’ (AR‐3NC‐1)In the above example both the subject and the comitative object go in, but the subject
actively, and the comitative object passively.
The interpretation of =tina can also be slightly reciprocal:

‘Only you will do like that (i.e. making babies together), with your sister.’(AY‐2NC‐6)107A grammar of YurakaréSometimes ‘comitative’ is translated into something like ‘concerning’ (46) or a shared
location:

REF‐like.that‐MID 3PL‐IO‐sit;be‐3=PL chicha=COM always=NVR 3PL‐husband=PL
‘Like that, they always awaited their husbands with chicha.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)In the above examples, the comitative object is not involved in the participant marking
on the verb. This is not always the case:
(47) li‐ma‐tütü‐ø=w=ya
a‐ye=tina
inele
a‐sibë=y
DEL‐3PL‐sit;be‐3=PL=NVR
3SG.P‐sister=COM inside
3SG.P‐house=LOC
‘They were inside the house together, with his sister.’ (AY‐2NC‐3)The story from which this utterance was taken deals with two persons: a brother and a
sister. The plural subject marker refers to both the brother and the sister, but the sister
is additionally marked with the comitative marker. This is a construction that is often
heard, also in local Spanish, as in e.g. vamos conmigo ‘let’s go with me’ (meaning let’s go
you and I).4.3.2 =la instrument
The postposition =la has a range of functions; the three most common are reason, path
and instrument. I will gloss the suffix with INS for instrument, since this seems to be the
basic notion from which the other uses are derived:

3SG.P‐head ax=INS
‘They hit his head with an ax.’ (AY‐3NC‐7)Notionally, the core function of the marker can be argued to be ‘instrument’ regarding
instrument as something that you can use to get from situation (or location) A to B. In
(48), bombo ‘smoke’ is the metaphorical instrument that causes a change of state of the
ancestors: from living to dead. A path is an instrument that connects two places. There
are some other constructions where =la occurs:

3PL‐AFO‐invite‐HAB‐3=PL=NVR

‘They invited their husbands to chicha.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)The use in the examples (51) and (52) is related to the ‘instrument’ function: the
language is used as an instrument to intermediate between two people; the inviting is
done with the help of chicha.
The examples in (53) are related to the ‘reason’ function of =la. Water and food, or
rather the lack of them, are the reasons for the starving and the almost dying of the
subjects.

this phenomenon when discussing local cases below.
Another use of =la as a marker of ‘theme’ is not straightforwardly linked to either
instrument, reason or path:

There are three local postpositions in Yurakaré, apart from the path function of =la. 17
The postposition =y marks the stative location of an object or person:

"1.2.3 Typological sketch
The basis of Yurakaré phonology is relatively simple. Yurakaré has 18 phonemic
consonants, distinguishing five places and five manners of articulation. There are
voiced counterparts for three of the plosives, as is exemplified in Table 1 below. As
far as vowels are concerned, Yurakaré has a total of seven phonemic vowels. They
are given in Table 2.plosives

uSyllable structure is (C)V(C), with a number of restrictions on which consonants
can be in the coda (cf. section 2.3.1). Morphophonological processes include
lenition (restricted to /k/), assimilation (mostly of consonants), elision (mostly
vowels), and gemination (both vowels and consonants). Stress assignment is more
complex. Yurakaré feet are iambic, counted from left to right; primary stress is
assigned to the rightmost dominant node and the final syllable is extrametrical.
However, there are affixes that bear their own prosodic information. Some affixes
attract (secondary or primary) stress, while yet others avoid being stressed. I call
the former stress‐attracting and the latter stress‐avoiding morphemes. Apart from
these two types of affixes, there are also prosodically neutral affixes and
diacritically marked roots.
Morphologically, Yurakaré can be characterized as an agglutinating language on
the scale of fusion, and fairly polysynthetic on the synthesis index.
(1)ti‐ma‐y‐mala‐m=chi
ku‐ta‐ø=ya
1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG=IGN 3SG.CO‐say‐3=NVR
‘Go and get them for me, she said to him.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)Verbs are usually morphologically complex, without much fusion. This can be
observed in example (1), where three participants are marked on the verb (ti‐ for
first person singular, ma‐ for third person plural object, and ‐m for second person
singular subject, as well as an applicative marker y‐ specifying the role of the third
person plural object (purposive). The ignorative marker is cliticized onto the verb.
The fact that this utterance in itself is a grammatically correct and complete
sentence illustrates the polysynthetic character of the morphology. There is no
incorporation of lexical items, however. Morpheme boundaries are generally
easily separable in Yurakaré and there is often a one‐form‐one‐meaning
correspondence. There is some fusion, however. As can be seen in example (1),
there is fusion of the categories person and number in cross‐referencing affixes,
and sometimes there is also fusion of grammatical relation markers with person
and number, as is the case with ku‐ in kutaya. In the case of the imperative there is
fusion of ‘imperative’ and number.
Yurakaré distinguishes seven wordclasses: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitics. The last three may possibly be subsumed
under the higher‐level category of particles.","[23, 24]"
"1.4 Outline of the work and conventions
The present work is organized as follows. In chapter 2 I will give a description of
the phonological system; an introduction to Yurakaré morphology will be given in
chapter 3. Chapter 1 discusses the noun phrase (the noun and its modifiers), while
chapter 5 deals with person marking, voice and valency. The verb phrase (the
verb, adverbs and verbal particles) is the topic of chapter 6, and in chapter 1 I will
outline the verbal and clausal enclitics that function on the propositional level. In
chapter 8, finally, I will discuss both simple and complex clauses.
The following chapters will contain many examples, which have references to
sources in the following way:

‘There was this Aysa once.’ (AY‐2NC‐6)18IntroductionThe reference to the source of this sentence is between parentheses. The first item
refers to the consultant, indicated with his initials, the number of the second item
refers to the number I gave to the particular minidisk; the letters refer to the place
where the sentence was recorded (in this case Nueva Canaan); the last item refers
to the track on the minidisk. Within this system of reference I also indicate
whether the data were taken from spontaneous speech (narrative or dialogue) or
whether they were obtained through elicitation. In the former case, the reference
will be between (round brackets) as in (9); in the latter case, the reference will be
between [square brackets]. Unfortunately, I have not been able to record every
elicitation session. Elicited examples that have been written down but not
recorded will be indicated as follows, with the name of the consultant followed by
‘PC’ for personal comment:

‘The thorn went into Juan’s foot.’ [FR‐PC]Furthermore I sometimes make use of data mentioned especially in Day (1980).
Unfortunately, this manuscript is unpaged, but it is divided into 40 chapters.
When referring to examples from the work of Day (1980) I will refer to the chapter
numbers in the following manner:
(11) anu‐ta

‘Shall I do it like that?’ [DAY‐1980‐14]The number ‘14’ here refers to chapter 14 of Day (1980). Since Day (1980) does not
use glosses, these are mine in all examples that I cite from this work.
As far as the glossing labels are concerned, a list of abbreviations can be found
on page viii at the beginning of the grammar. I furthermore distinguish
typographically between affixing, cliticization and reduplication. In this I follow
the Leipzig Glossing Rules. Affixes are indicated with a single dash (‐), clitics are
marked by the equality sign (=), reduplication, finally, is marked by a tilde (~).
Finally, I make a difference between portmanteau morphemes and morphemes
that are normally separate but that have fused phonologically. In the former case
the two meaning elements are separated by a single dot; in the latter case they are
separated by a colon:

singular subject. The fact that this suffix has fused with the root is indicated by a
colon. The suffix ‐y itself refers both to first person and to the fact that it is the
subject of the sentence. These two meanings are separated by a single dot.","[33, 34, 35]"

‘His arrow did not catch fire, subsequently.’ (AY‐2NC‐5)In these examples the clitic na is not used adjectivally, but rather independently,
except for the second occurrence of na in (49)b. In (49)b and c the corresponding
noun phrase follows later, in (49)a, there is no corresponding noun phrase. Note
too, that the clitic form of the demonstrative cannot be marked for plural, as can
be observed in (49)a and c. Furthermore, in (49)c, the clitic seems to attach to the
preceding word instead of the following word. In this specific example, na is
followed by a small pause. These facts make it hard to classify these clitics as
proclitics or enclitics. The clitics an and a(t) are more restricted. They usually only64Morphologyappear in adjectival position, and do not alternate with free forms in other
positions.
Another group of reduced, unstressed clitics are reduced forms of the adverb
latijsha ‘then, after that, when’, which functions as a connector. The forms are lash
and la.

themselves unstressed. They seem to be restricted to clause initial position, but the
full form latijsha (which is sometimes also reduced to lashsha, a reduced form that
still carries stress) also mainly occurs in clause‐initial position.
Some other adverbs also have reduced forms, such as achu ‘like that’ (ash) and
anu ‘like this’ (an), ushta ‘before’ (ush). Examples of ash= are given in (51):

pronouns precede ((52)b and d) or follow ((52)a and c) the predicate or noun they
are cross‐referenced with.
In the examples of the remainder of the grammar, I will not indicate the
proclitics discussed in examples (48)‐(52) by means of the symbol ‘=’. I will in fact
not distinguish these enclitics from separate words in their representation, since
they do not seem to constitute one word with their host as much as the other
clitics do, as we will see. First, they do not form a phonological word with their
host as far as prosody is concerned; second, they seem to be more free positionally
than class II and class III clitics. Class I enclitics differ furthermore from class II
and III clitics in Yurakaré in that whereas the former generally have unreduced
and independent counterparts, the latter two do not.
Before discussing class II clitics, I will first discuss class III clitics. Class III clitics
can be termed phrasal enclitics because they attach to a phrase‐final element. In
the nominal domain, the plural marker and the postpositional markers are
examples of phrasal enclitics:
(53) abmatata ti‐pojore=w
big
1SG‐canoe=PL
‘my big canoes’
inele
elle=y
inside
earth=LOC
‘in the ground’vs.vs.ti‐pojore
matata=w
1SG‐canoe
big=PL
‘my big canoes’
elle
inele=y
earth inside=LOC
‘in the ground’The order of adjectives and nouns can be reversed, as can be seen in (53).
Nevertheless, the plural marker in (53)a as well as the postposition in (53)b remain
where they are: they attach to the rightmost element of the NP. Other nominal
enclitics are =chi ‘directional’, =jsha ‘ablative’, =la ‘instrumental’, =tina ‘comitative’
and =ja ‘subject emphasis marker’. I will discuss all of these in sections 4.2 and 4.3
below.
NPs can be discontinuous in Yurakaré (cf. section 4.1). The head of the NP in
these circumstances is postverbal, while its modifier is in preverbal, focus position.
In these cases, the postpositions are still attached to the (rightmost) head noun,
while the preposed modifier does not have any postpositional marking:
(54) abdanda‐shti
kummë matata=la
go.up‐FUT.1SG.S tree
big=INS
‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]
matata danda‐shti
kummë=la
big
go.up‐FUT.1SG.S
tree=INS
‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]66MorphologyPlural markers behave a little differently. When a plural NP is discontinuous,
usually both the modifier and the head noun are marked for plural:
(55) lëshie=w ma‐bëjti
shunñe=w
two=PL 3PL‐see:1SG.S man=PL
‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]Plural markers are generally found more often on both the head noun and the
modifier, even if the NP is not discontinuous, and especially with the order noun‐
adjective. Postpositional enclitics are never found on both elements.
There are also a few clausal clitics that mostly attach to the clause‐final element.
These are modal and aspectual particles. Examples are =la ‘validational’, =bë
‘momentaneous’, =se ‘repetition (among other meanings)’ and =bëla (continuative).
They normally attach to the rightmost element of the clause, and are associated
semantically with the propositional level (cf. chapter 1):
(56) abcdyokkoshe

is attached to the object of the verb, and in (56)c, the enclitic =se attaches to the
subject. The enclitic =bëla in (56)d, finally, is attached to the subject. These enclitics
can also attach to other parts of speech:
(57) abctiya‐y=la

adverb. In other words: these syntactic enclitics can attach to different hosts when
they are the last element of the clause. Occasionally, an element that pertains to
the clause comes after the clausal enclitic:
(58) abmala‐ø=la

they belong to. This is especially clear with the enclitic =bëla ‘continuative’ in the
following example:

according to the gender of the speaker: =ri/=ra for men and =yu/=ye for women:

‘Half an hour, the old one wanted.’ (FL‐14MA‐1)As mentioned above, clitics cannot be morphologically followed by affixes. They
can, however, be followed by a lexical element in a compound. In (61), the stem
mujumuju carries the locative postposition =y, which in turn is followed by the
compounded noun bëshë ‘thing, entity’.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"
"1172Morphologysemantic head of the noun phrase. This can be described as follows: “the head of a
noun phrase is the one word within the phrase that refers to the same entity the
whole phrase refers to” (Payne 1997:33). So in an example such as (69), we might
say that shunñe ‘man’ is the semantic head, and matata ‘big’ refers to a property of
the man.
(69) matata shunñe
big
man
‘a/the big man’It can be said that the NP as a whole refers to a man, not to a big. In constructions
such as the following, however, it seems that typical noun candidates are in fact
not the semantic head:
(70) abchajmu shunñe
dog
man
‘male dog’ [MV‐32MA‐9]
dyolojoto shunñe
amardillo man
‘armadillo‐man’ 12 (AY‐2NC‐2)These are not morphological compounds, since each word carries its own primary
stress. Nevertheless, constructions such as the ones in (70) are rather marginal. In
the prototypical situation it is a property word that is in the modifying role.
The noun is not obligatory in the noun phrase, even though it is present in the
vast majority of cases. If the head noun is missing, we are dealing with elliptic
constructions in which it is clear from the context which object is referred to.

‘The little green one [i.e. plate] is below.’ (FL‐14MA‐2)In (71)a, the reference is to a field, which has been the topic of conversation for the
last couple of utterances 13. The same can be said for (71)b, where the topic ofThis might also refer to a male armadillo, but this particular example from a narrative
refers to a male person, who has shared characteristics with an armadillo.
13 The word maj~matata cannot be interpreted as a predicative complement of the verb ti‐
jusu, (‘I want it to be big’), since then it would have to be marked with the intentional
marker ‐ni and the subordinate marker =ti (cf. section 8.2.4)
1273A grammar of Yurakaréconversation has been plates. It is only in these circumstances, i.e. when the
referent is known from the context that we can have an adjective by itself in
argument position.
Other criteria to establish the head of the NP are not really useful for Yurakaré.
There is no clear agreement within the NP, while grammatical relations, number
and articles cliticize to the NP as a whole rather than to one of the words in it.
Functionally, some nouns can be used as adjectives, as is shown in example (70)
above. Other such nouns are pëpë (grandfather/old), tejte (grandmother/old) and
yee (woman). Nouns can also function as predicates, without any overt marking to
signal the change of category. I will come back to this when discussing verbs in
section 3.3.3 below.
Morphologically, nouns can be set apart on the basis that they are the only word
class that takes possessive marking in the form of personal prefixes, cf. (72)a or
predicative possession, by means of the prefix i‐, cf. (72)b:
(72) abti‐sibë
1SG‐house
‘my house’
atta=jsha
i‐tanti‐ø
other=ABL
VBL‐eye;face‐3
‘He had his face on the other side.’ (OR‐19MA‐20)However, some animals, i.e. pets cannot be possessed, they need a lexical
classifier:
(73) a
b*ti‐talipa
ti‐tiba
talipa
1SG‐pet chicken
‘my chicken’Property words cannot take possessive prefixes:
(74) a *ti‐matata
b *i‐matata‘my big one’
‘He has a big one.’ (JMB‐PC)Action words normally cannot take possessive prefixes either, except for some
verbs. When they are marked with the possessive prefixes, these words refer to
the result of an action and are nominal:74Morphology(75) abcti‐dula
1SG‐do;make
‘my product’
ti‐nënë
1SG‐cook
‘my cooking’
ti‐sawata
1SG‐work
‘my work.’In conclusion, even though there is some spill‐over and the criteria have
exceptions, nouns can be characterized by the fact that they are the semantic head
of an NP, control the number behavior of the NP, and that they are by and large
the only word class that takes possessive morphology. Nouns, and
subclassifications of nouns will be discussed in more detail in section 4.4.","[87, 88, 89, 90]"
"Verbal agreement, voice and valencyGrammatical relations in Yurakaré are mainly marked through verbal cross‐
referencing. Word order does not play a role in identifying grammatical relations, and
dependent marking (postpositions ‐ cf. section 4.3) is used mainly to mark peripheral
participants. Subjects and objects are marked on the verb; subjects are suffixes and
objects are prefixes. In addition to this, Yurakaré has an elaborate system of
applicatives, as well as a middle marker and a causative construction to modify the
valency of a verb. In this chapter I will discuss transitivity, valency and the encoding of
subjects and direct objects on the verb (5.1), applicatives (5.2), and voice (5.3).
5.1 Person marking, valency and transitivity
Dixon & Aikhenvald (2000:3) make a distinction between valency and transitivity:
“There are two main transitivity types ‐ intransitive (with core argument S) and
intransitive (with A and O) ‐ and plain and extended subtypes of each (depending on
whether or not E [extension to core ‐ RvG] is also in the core”. Schematically, this can
be represented as follows:
(a) intransitive
(b) extended intransitive
(c) transitive
(d) extended transitiveS
S
A
AE
O
OEValency, in this view, relates to the number of core arguments, i.e. one in (a), two in (b),
two in (c) and three in (d). I will follow Dixon & Aikhenvald in making the distinction
between valency and transitivity, since it is a useful one for describing the Yurakaré
system.
In Yurakaré, the distinction between valency and transitivity is directly reflected in
the formal behavior of the verb. Subjects and direct objects are obligatorily cross‐
referenced on the verb; intransitive verbs do not have object markers, whereas
transitive verbs do. Any extension of transitivity is formally marked, e.g. by means of
applicative or causative markers, even if the extended argument belongs to the
semantic argument structure of a verb.
As mentioned, the two basic arguments, subject and direct object are both cross‐
referenced on the verb, subjects are cross‐referenced by suffixes, objects by prefixes.
The paradigms look as follows:143A grammar of YurakaréTable 30 ‐ Person marking paradigms

a gender distinction 1. As for the two zero elements in the paradigm, I do not consider
the zero element in the object paradigm to be actually present; it is simply a gap in the
paradigm triggering a default interpretation of third person singular, the typical
interpretation for a zero element cross‐linguistically (Siewierska 2004: 24). The zero
element in the third person singular and plural subject is a different matter. The
nominal plural marker is =w (cf. section 4.2). I assume that this plural enclitic needs a
nominal element to have scope over. Viewing the subject paradigm as such
furthermore has the advantage that it shows that the bound subject affixes follow the
same pattern as the free pronouns:

(e.g. mëë vs. ‐m, tuwa vs. ‐tu, paa vs. ‐p) the subject paradigm and the free pronouns are
related. The free pronoun paradigm, which consists of four personal pronouns – for
third person reference demonstrative pronouns are used – shows suppletive forms for
singular and plural first and second person pronouns, whereas the demonstratives
referring to third persons are marked for plural in a regular way, by means of the
enclitic =w. This same distinction between first and second persons on the one hand
and third on the other is observed in the subject marking paradigm.","[158, 159]"
"10101A grammar of YurakaréThe last observation entails that clothing consisted of several patches of the inside of
the bark of the Ficus, hence the inherently plural status of clothing items, and the
mosquito net 11. Although we can explain the occurrence of the plural marker =w in
singular contexts with these nouns, we cannot predict which nouns will behave like
this. There are other artifacts and utensils that do not behave like this, like norpe
‘paddle’, which can be either singular or plural, or other body parts like shishta ‘finger’,
which is also a collection of bones, but can be either singular or plural. The noun pujshi
means ‘body hair’ or ‘fur’ and is always singular (see below). Only clothing items
always seem to belong to class I generically. There are, furthermore, other nouns in this
class that cannot be explained straightforwardly, such as yarru ‘chicha’, shuppëw ‘urine’,
ulliw ‘penis (adult)’, wiwiw ‘penis (child)’ 12. This means that, although there is a
semantic basis for this behavior, whether some noun is seen as inherently plural or not
is ultimately a lexically determined matter.
Class III and IV nouns (together forming a class of inherently singular nouns) are
among others typical mass nouns, scenery, some body parts, tools and utensils, crops,
as well as other categories. Examples are given in Table 22 (Spanish loanwords in
italics):

semantic patterns that emerge, but, as with the inherently plural nouns, we cannot
predict the nouns that fall into this class on purely semantic grounds, since there are
many exceptions to the semantic generalizations given in Table 22. For instance,
substances do not fall into these classes uniformly. There are substances that fall into
In spite of the quote from Richter (1930), Vincent Hirtzel (p.c.) commented that clothing is
usually made out of one single piece of bark. In that case another explanation should be sought.
12 Modifiers of ulliw and wiwiw cannot take the collective marker, so these two nouns are
somewhat deviant.
11102The noun phraseclass II, like yarru ‘maize beer’ and shuppëw ‘urine’. Looking at the body parts, the list
includes concepts that prototypically come in pairs, like meyye ‘ears’, dyukku ‘buttocks’
(and also e.g. tanti ‘eyes’ and tululu ‘lips’). There are also concepts in this class that are
prototypically singular, like, perente ‘forehead’, unti ‘nose’, ërumë ‘tongue’. However, a
noun like, pullë ‘testicle’ is a ‘normal’ count noun, which can be marked for plural.
Utensils are found in both the inherently plural class and the count noun class as well.
There are many crops in the count noun class, most of them larger crops than the ones
in the class of inherently singular nouns 13, but a noun like arush ‘rice’ can be
pluralized. 14 In short: meaning does not fully allow us to predict class membership.
This is ultimately a lexically determined matter; there seems to be a partially covert
system of number marking.
Within the semantic categories of Table 22, class IV nouns are mainly found in the
group of utensils (all inherently singular utensils are class IV) and in bounded mass.
Especially this latter observation might give us more insight into the nature of
collectivity in Yurakaré:

matat‐ima

case modifiers are generally marked for collectivity:

‘a big lake/river’ [FA‐5MA‐1]The suffix ‐ima apparently does not only denote that the quality or quantity expressed
by the modifier applies to a plurality as a whole, but it also means that this plurality is
bounded. This double function can be explained with the following overview from
Jackendoff (1991), taken from Corbett (2000:80):The size of crops may have something to do with the mass‐count distinction (cf. Corbett
2000:80, Jackendoff 1991).
14 The noun arush does not take the plural marker =w for phonological reasons, but it does
trigger plural agreement on the verb.

aggregatesThe addition of ‐ima to a modifier of a normal plural noun (aggregates in Table 23)
forces the interpretation that we are dealing with a bounded plurality:
(36) [‐bounded,+internal structure][+bounded,+internal structure]If we look at substances, the addition of ‐ima forces the interpretation ‘a bounded body
of mass’:
(37) [‐bounded,‐internal structure][+bounded,‐internal structure]It is not clear whether class IV nouns denoting artefacts can be integrated into this
analysis. A list of some of the inherently singular nouns that take collective markers on
their modifiers is given in Table 24:

ironThe items in the left column of Table 24 are artifacts, items that might be considered to
consist of smaller parts or bounded mass. For instance a comb (as well as a basket) was
made out of lianas tied together (cf. Nordenskiöld 2003b:58), knives are bounded
bodies of iron, etc. However, this explanation is rather speculative and has a danger of
being circular. Therefore this hypothesis should ideally be tested with psycholinguistic
experiments. This falls outside the scope of this grammar.
There are contexts in which normal count nouns do not receive the plural marker in
contexts where they are plural, nor do they trigger plural agreement on the verb:104The noun phrase(38) too‐jti
ka 15‐ssë‐ø=ti
pu‐ø=ja
decheche‐ø=ya
bone‐LIM 3SG‐be‐3=DS
take.PL‐3=SS
meet;find.CAU‐3=NVR
‘It was full of bones, which she picked up and collected.’ (FA‐6MA‐5)In the example the speaker is talking about a plurality of bones, a fact that is stressed
by the presence of the plural stem puu ‘take’ (cf. section 6.2.2). The form too ‘bone’ is a
class I noun that can be marked for plural, but here it does not take the marker =w, nor
does it trigger plural verbal agreement. This is due to recategorization of the noun too.
It is represented as a mass of bones. Speakers translate this into Spanish with había puro
hueso ‘(lit.) there was pure bone’, meaning ‘there was bone all over the place’, much in
the same way it is possible to say ‘There was dog all over the road’ in English (cf.
Corbett 2000:81).
I have also found one instance of the reverse, where a class III noun is marked for
plural:
(39) pela‐jti‐ø=w
ñowwo lëshpëni=bë
peel‐HAB‐3=PL
manioc first=MOM
‘First they peel the yucca for a while.’
ñowwo pela=ya

‘When the yucca is peeled, they put them in the fire.’
latijsha ati kula‐ø=w=ti
ma‐müta‐jti‐ø=w
then
DEM boil‐3=PL=DS
3PL‐take.out‐HAB‐3=PL
‘Then, when they boil, they take them out.’ (FL‐1MA‐14)In the beginning of this text explaining how to make chicha (a drink made of – in this
case – manioc), the manioc is singular in the first sentence (ñowwo is a class III noun),
but in the second sentence, in between the verbs pelaya (singular agreement) and
limattaw (plural agreement) there is a switch from singular to plural where ñowwo
triggers plural verb agreement. In the last sentence the demonstrative pronoun ati has
no plural marking, but triggers plural marking on the verb.
It might be that somewhere in the process of making chicha something happens,
which makes the substance plural (e.g. the addition of water). This might be connected
to the fact that ‘problematic’ class II nouns dyarru ‘chicha’ and shuppëw ‘urine’ have
undergone processes (fermentation and digestion, respectively) 16. And it might also be
connected to the fact that artefacts (most of which are in class II and IV, beingThe prefix ka‐ marks a special state‐construction here. This construction will be discussed in
section (5.1) below.
16 I am grateful to Vincent Hirtzel for pointing out this fact to me.
15105A grammar of Yurakaréinherently collective) also undergo a process: manufacturing. However, how this is
connected to collectivity is not clear.
A final point worth mentioning here is that Yurakaré has a vocative plural marker,
optionally used when addressing a group:
(40) dula‐n‐tu
ta‐pojore
ti‐lele‐ypa
do;make‐INTL‐1PL.S
1PL‐canoe
1SG‐grandchild‐VOC.PL
‘Let’s make our canoe, my grandchildren.’ (OR‐20MA‐1)This vocative marker is simply added to the addressee, which is plural but loses the
redundant plural marker. The form of the suffix is related to the second person plural
object marker pa‐. Interestingly, the collective marker ‐ima has exactly the same formal
relation to the third person plural object marker ma‐, and both ‐ipa and ‐ima has the
function of grouping together aggregates.

there is no such form as ‐ita.","[116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"
"147A grammar of YurakaréThe entities referred to by the cross‐reference affixes in (1) may additionally be
expressed by overt noun phrases, but this is not required. The utterances in (1) are
perfectly grammatical sentences. Polysynthesis in the strong sense (termed
incorporating in Comrie 1989a) does not apply to Yurakaré. The language does
not allow noun incorporation into a verb, and nominal compounding, although it
occurs (cf. section 3.2.4), is not a very frequent process.
Another way to characterize the morphology of a language is head‐marking
versus dependent‐marking, proposed as a typological parameter by Nichols
(1986). Yurakaré has characteristics of both types, although the language is
basically head marking. Possessive relations are head marked, cf. example (2), as
are core grammatical relations subject and direct object, and applied objects, cf.
example (3):
(2)ab(3)absëë

ti‐ma‐n‐kaya‐ma
yarru 2
1SG‐3PL‐IO‐give‐IMP.SG chicha
‘Give me chicha.’ [FP‐13MA‐13]Other, more peripheral semantic roles are encoded by enclitics that mark the
dependent noun phrase:
(4)abyupa‐ø=ya
a‐mumuy
a‐ballata=tina
enter.SG‐3=NVR 3SG.P‐all

awëwë‐ø tejte‐shama
1PL‐language=INS

‘The old woman was crying in our language.’ (OR‐20MA‐10)Whether arguments are head or dependent marked furthermore has to do with
topicality. The more topical a referent, the more likely it is head marked (cf. Van
Gijn 2005).
The noun yarru (which loses its geminate consonant when it carries the possessive
prefixes) is inherently plural, cf. section 4.2.","[62, 63]"

DEM‐LIM=EMPHAdjectives can either precede or follow the head noun. There seems to be no semantic
distinction connected to the different orders. The normal case, however, is that
adjectives are used as predicates, a point also observed by Day (1980). It is often hard
to decide whether a semantically modifying element is used as a predicate or a
dependent adjective, since there is partial overlap in morphology (cf. section 3.3).
Nevertheless, examples like (4) show that within the NP, there are two possible
positions for the adjective.
(4)shuyulë
yee=w
~
beautiful woman=PL
‘beautiful women’yeeshuyulë=wPlurality is generally marked once for every NP. The number clitic appears on the final
element of the NP. The fact that the adjective and the noun ‘share’ a number marker (a
phrasal enclitic) suggests that they are within one and the same NP. Nevertheless, the
number enclitic is not exemplary for a phrasal enclitic, since it is often expressed on the
noun as well as the adjective, especially with the order NA. I will come back to this
point below (4.2).
Another set of enclitics are the postpositions marking the relationship of the NP to its
head. These postpositions follow the position of the plural enclitic. There is only one
slot for postpositions; there are no instances of a combination of two or more
postpositions on one NP. An example of such a postposition is the comitative marker is
given in (5):
(5)… a‐bonto=w=tina
3SG.P‐son=PL=COM
‘…with his sons’ (AR‐8MI‐64)As far as relation‐marking strategies are concerned, dependent‐marking strategies
compete with head‐marking strategies where the relationship between the verb and its
dependent NPs is encoded on the verb. This has to do with topicality and animacy.
Animate topical participants are more likely cross referenced on the verb, e.g. by
means of applicative constructions, non‐topical, inanimate participants are more likely
to be marked by means of a postposition (cf. Van Gijn 2005) 2. Postpositions will be
discussed in 4.3; head marking of grammatical relations will be the topic of sections 5.1
and 5.22Some relations, such as subject and direct object, are always marked on the verb.","[106, 107]"
"4.1 Introduction
In this section I will make some general remarks on the structure and composition of
the NP in Yurakaré, with special reference to the order of words within the NP.
The template of the Noun Phrase in Yurakaré is as follows 1:
QN(1)[DEMAPOSSN(POSS)A ] =PL=POSTP(REL CLAUSE)NUMNoun phrases are headed by a noun, the element that determines the syntactic function
of the whole phrase (cf. Payne 1997:31). Nouns can be modified by adjectives,
quantifiers, numerals, possessor phrases or adjectivally used demonstratives.
Demonstratives, quantifiers and numerals always precede the noun they modify. All
three can be used independently as well, forming an elliptic NP of their own. Numerals
and quantifiers are mutually exclusive in one and the same NP for semantic reasons.
Demonstratives and quantifiers do co‐occur:
(2)atilëtta
yee
DEM
one
woman
‘this one woman’ (AR‐8MI‐3)Possessors are cross‐referenced on the possessed noun. Since they are cross‐referenced,
the overt expression of the possessor NP is not obligatory. When expressed, possessors
in the vast majority of cases precede the possessed noun. It is not prohibited however,
for the possessor to follow the possessed noun:I am leaving relative clauses out of the discussion in this chapter; they will be treated below in
section 8.2.",[106]

ø/ka‐

ka‐In section 4.2 above, I have characterized class I nouns as the default type: nouns that
have a marked opposition singular versus plural; class II nouns are inherently plural
and inherently collective; class III nouns are inherently singular; class IV nouns, finally,
are inherently singular and inherently collective.
As can be observed in Table 32, the marker ka‐ as an indicator of third person
singular direct objects only occurs with class III nouns in some cases and with class IV
nouns in all cases. In constructions such as in (3), ka‐ is used as a cross‐reference marker
for all third persons singular, no matter what nominal class. In Table 33, an overview is
given of the paradigms of the direct object and the comitative object with regard to
class I nouns:

exemplified in (3)b and c, is related to verbal number (cf. section 6.2.2). A handful of
verbs in Yurakaré vary in their form according to the number of participants taking
part in the event. This system of participant‐based verbal number is organized
according to an ergative pattern: intransitive verbs change form according to the
number of the S argument, transitive verbs change according to the number of the O
argument, a pattern universally attested in languages that have such a system of
participant based verbal number (cf. Corbett 2000: 253):

ma‐jokko‐y
3PL‐throw.away.PL‐1SG.S
‘I threw them away.’146Verbal agreement, voice & valencyThe verb roots mala (for singular) and bali (for plural) change according to the
number of the subject participant, cf. (4)a and b; chitta and kokko 2 in (4)c and d, change
according to the number of the direct object participant. With an extended intransitive
like ka‐mala‐ø, the number of object participants has no consequences for the form of
the verb: it still changes according to the number of the subject participant. In other
words: the ergative pattern of verbal plural marking is sensitive only to the transitivity
value of the root.
(5)abma‐mala‐ø
3PL‐go.SG‐3SG
‘He takes them with him.’
ka‐bali‐ø=w
3SG‐go.SG‐3=PL
‘They take it with them.’In these two respects (i.e. consistant overt marking of third person singular direct
object and no influence on participant based verbal number) the comitative object
construction patterns with other, more clearly marked applicative constructions.
There is another construction worth mentioning in the context of the discussion on
transitivity and valency in Yurakaré:
(6)ablatijsha
ka‐posojto‐ø=ya
a‐tulujta

3SG‐explode‐3=NVR 3SG.P‐brain
‘Then her brain exploded.’ (AR‐8MI‐52)
ti‐tenche=w
ma‐dele‐ø=w
1SG‐necklace=PL
3PL‐fall.SG‐3=PL
‘My necklace fell.’ [FP‐13MA‐13]In these constructions, the verb is still semantically intransitive, but formally, two
participants are marked: the zero element for subject and ka‐ for object in (6)a 3, and the
third person plural prefix ma‐ for object and the markers ‐ø and =w together for third
person plural subject. Tulujta ‘brain’ is a class III noun, tenchew ‘necklace’ a class II
noun. It seems that the verbs in (6) agree twice with the S‐participant. There is some
evidence, however, that the object agreement only refers to the number of the
participants, and not to the person:The form jokko is a surface variant of kokko: /k/ changes into [h], spelled j after a vowel, cf.
section 2.3.2.
3 The form marked with ka‐ is not found with class I nouns.

The meaning of this construction, which is found with intransitive verbs indicating
some state or change of state, is not entirely transparent, but in most cases it seems to
stress the fact that we are dealing with a coherent collective or bounded piece of mass
that is affected in some way. In relation to this, it is mostly found when S participants
are of class II or IV, which are inherently collective nouns.","[160, 161, 162, 163]"
"71A grammar of Yurakaré3.3 Parts of speech
As is shown in Anward et al. (1997), languages can differ from each other in
several respects when it comes to the inventory of their lexical categories. They
can differ in what kind of categories they identify; the distinction between verbs
and nouns seems to be universal (Schachter 1985:6‐7), though even that is
questioned (cf. Hengeveld 1992:67 for Tuscarora). Adjectives, (manner) adverbs
and smaller parts of speech are not universal at all. Languages can also differ in
terms of the criteria that can be used to distinguish their lexical categories. The
general approach in any language to distinguish lexical categories is that “the
primary, definitional properties of parts of speech are semantic or pragmatic,
rather than form related; (…) semantic or pragmatic features are part‐of‐speech
defining only if there is at least one formal characteristic that correlates with
them” (Anward et al. 1997:172). Formal characteristics can be found on the
syntactic, morphological or phonological level 11. Languages differ as to which of
these formal characteristics correlates with the semantic‐pragmatic features.
These differences, together with the fact that the boundaries between the
different parts of speech are sometimes rather fuzzy (cf. Payne 1997:32), make it a
difficult task to identify the parts of speech of a language. Therefore the
distinctions I have chosen to make, although based on notional, syntactic,
morphological, and sometimes even phonological criteria, do not reflect rigid
classes with clear‐cut boundaries, but rather they reflect tendencies associated
with certain lexical classes.
When these precautions are taken into consideration, we might say that
Yurakaré distinguishes seven lexical classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitic particles. I will discuss each of the parts of
speech in turn, stating their (prototypical) notional, syntactic and morphological
characteristics as well as subclassifications. I will start with nouns (3.3.1), followed
by adjectives (3.3.2), verbs (3.3.3), adverbs (3.3.4), ideophones (3.3.5), interjections
(3.3.6), and finally clitic particles (3.3.7).","[86, 87]"

(1994:191) for Quechua as quantifiers that are obligatorily inflected. 28
Yurakaré has four indigenous numerals: lëtta ‘one’, lëshie ‘two’, liwi ‘three’ and lëpsha
‘four’. The rest of the numerals are borrowed from Spanish. These four numerals have
always stood apart in the more elaborate numbering system. LaCueva (1893:7) gives
the following list of numerals: 29
Los numerales son: 1 lecta; 2 lasie; 3 livi; 4 lapsa; 5 cheti; 6 chicheti; 7 livi tese;
8 lasie tese; 9 lecta tese; 10 tibanti; 11 lecta‐n‐dojo; 20 lasie tibanti, lasie‐juta
tibanti, lasie sata; 100 tibanti sata, ca‐sata, tibanti‐ve. Regularmente señalan la
cuenta con los dedos. 30
Apart from the numerals 1‐4, one could also say that cheti is also a basic numeral, and it
seems that this was the last numeral to have been lost, judging from the data in Day
(1991). She indicates that numerals six and upward are only encountered in the more
remote national park Isiboro‐Sécure, while cheti is still found in her fieldwork sites.
Day (1991) also shows some differences with LaCueva in the higher numerals:
(138) numerals 6 and further (Day 1991)
chichiti

chichiti lëtta; lëtta tësë
7
chichiti lëshie; lëshie tësë
8
chichiti liwi; liwi tësë
9
tibanti
10
tibantija chetindojo
50These differences between Day’s (1991) and La Cueva’s (1893) data suggest that
numerals, at least from 7 upward, were not grammaticalized. The element ti is an
enclitic or suffix, nowadays found on the Spanish numerals, meaning something like
‘quantity’ (e.g. also on the question word am‐ti ‘how much, many’). Tibanti can be
interpreted ti‐banna‐ti, ‘the quantity of my hand(s)’. Tësë is a verb meaning ‘to stand’. If
we then look at the numerals of La Cueva, we might expect that counting was done by
leaving out fingers and then indicating how many fingers of the second hand were left
standing: with seven there are three fingers left standing, with eight there are two and
with nine only one. Eleven (lecta‐n‐dojo) can also be explained more or less: idojo means
to surpass, ti‐n‐dojo means to pass me by, lëtta‐n‐dojo then could have meant ‘to pass
one by, or surpass with one’. The meaning of lasie tibanti for twenty is clear, lassie‐juta
Muysken (1994:191) also mentions sapa ‘alone’. In Yurakaré, dala ‘alone’ also has deviant
behavior in that it takes indirect objects.
29 In La Cueva’s orthography, c refers to /k/, b and v both refer to /b/ and no distinction is made
between /s/ and /S/ or between /a/ and /Q/.
30 They regularly signal the counting with their fingers [my translation].

adverbs from cardinal numerals) and sata in lassie sata means ‘to be finished or
terminated’. Ca‐sata for 100 means ‘to be finished with it’; the ‐ve suffix is the same as
the collective plural marker ‐ybe discussed below.
The counting in the more recent data from Day (1991) is done in a somewhat
different way: not by leaving out fingers, but by adding fingers, where apparently one
of the fingers (possibly the thumb or the little finger) does not count, so lëtta tësë (one is
standing) for seven, actually means that two are standing, plus the other hand, and so
on for 8 and 9. Tibantija chetindojo cannot be interpreted otherwise than ‘five times my
hand’.
Numerals can undergo several morphological operations. The most common is the
addition of the suffix combination ‐ju‐ta ‘frequency’ and ‘middle voice’:
(139) ablëshie‐ju‐ta
two‐FRQ‐MID
‘twice’
siete‐ti‐ju‐ta
seven‐QN‐FRQ‐MID
‘seven times’This use of the numerals can be made personal (data from Day 1980‐28):
(140) abcdti‐n‐lëttu‐ju
1SG‐IO‐one‐FRQ
‘once for me’
ti‐n‐nishi‐ju
1SG‐IO‐two‐FRQ
‘twice for me’
ti‐n‐niwi‐ju
1SG‐IO‐three‐FRQ
‘three times for me’
ti‐n‐napshu‐ju
1SG‐IO‐four‐FRQ
‘four times for me’In a phrase:
(141) ta‐n‐lëttu‐ju
bali‐tu
uwal‐chi
1PL‐IO‐one‐FRQ go.PL‐1PL.S cochabamba=DIR
‘We went once to Cochabamba.’ (DAY1980‐28)My scarce data on this subject are a little different from Day’s examples:140The noun phrase(142) abti‐n‐lëshie=w=ju
1SG‐IO‐two=PL=FRQ
‘I do it twice.’[MH‐25MA‐9]
ti‐n‐lëpshu‐j‐ta
1SG‐IO‐four:PL‐FRQ‐MID
‘I do it four times.’ [MH‐25MA‐9]In (142), the numerals are made plural, and occur with the element /l/. Example (142)b,
moreover, contains both the indirect object prefix and the middle marker. The
translation is ‘to do something X times’.
Numerals can also be prefixed with the passive comitative applicative. In this way
adverbs of time are formed (data from Day 1980‐28):
(143) ti‐lëtta
ka‐shie‘one day for me/it takes me one day’
‘two days for me/it takes me two days’Many of these features seem to have been lost, at least in the areas that I have worked
in, since the consultants I worked with do not accept the forms in (140)‐(143).
Interestingly, in constructions like the ones in (140) and (143), numerals 2‐4 lose their
initial l‐. It is therefore very probably that this l‐ used to be a prefix, possibly related to
delimitative li‐. 31
The marker ‐(j)cha on numerals and quantifiers indicates that the number refers to the
complete collection:
(144) ablëshie‐p=cha
pa‐dayu=ya
pa‐bati

The question word tëtë ‘what, which’ is adjectival in nature. It is usually found
compounded with the form ‐pshë, which is short for bëshëë. The noun bëshëë can be used
independently, in which case it most often means ‘clothes’, ‘animals’, ‘stuff’. Bëshëë
compounded with other words means ‘the one who (is) X’:It is also possible that the same element is present in lëmmuy ‘only, just; in vain’. The second
part is probably the same as mumuy/mumay ‘all’.","[152, 153, 154, 155, 156]"

There are three category‐changing derivational suffixes that can be found on nouns: an
adjectivizer ‐kka, a verbalizer i‐ and an adverbializer ‐shku(ta).
‐kka: ‘measure’
The suffix ‐kka is added mostly to demonstrative pronouns to indicate that the size of
something is comparable to a size indicated (mostly by holding the hand on a certain
height).
(98) ana‐kka‐ø
DEM‐MEA‐3
‘He is this big.’ (indicating height with hand)The suffix ‐kka changes the nominal element into an adjectival one; consequently it can
receive the collective marker ‐ima or the distributive marker ‐uma:
(99) a‐werta
ana‐kk‐ima
3SG.P‐basket
DEM‐MEA‐COL
‘His basket was about this big.’ (AY‐3NC‐7)It is also found on proper names (100), as well as on the question word ama (101):
(100) ti‐tëë
karina‐kka
ati
1SG‐niece;nephew
Karina‐MEA
DEM
‘She was the size of Karina.’ (BT‐27MA‐10)

INTS~which‐MEA
2SG‐want‐3 1PL‐field
2SG‐IO‐do;make‐INTL:1SG.S=DS
‘What size would you like me to make our field?’ (AR‐8MI‐41)The suffix ‐kka in the sense of size is often found in combination with the amplification
marker ‐lë. When this suffix is attached, the marker ‐kka loses its gemination and is124The noun phraserendered ‐ja after a vowel (because of the lenition of [k], see section 2.3.2 above). The
interpretation of this combination is small size:
(102) kumë‐nñu ana‐ja‐lë
ajtilya‐nñu
ti‐ja‐mal‐cha‐m
tree‐DIM
DEM‐MEA‐AMP
splinter‐DIM
1SG‐3SG‐go.SG‐JUS‐2SG.S
‘Bring me a small tree, only this size, a splinter!’ (OR‐20MA‐2)Even though the marker seems to attach mostly to nominal elements, it can also appear
on the verb abibë ‘to be enough’:
(103) abibë‐kka‐ø‐naja
ta‐jukkulë
be.enough‐MEA‐3‐DSC
1PL‐field
‘Our field is big enough now.’ (AR‐8MI‐42)As mentioned in section 4.3 above, in combination with the locative marker =y and the
ablative marker =jsha, this suffix can also indicate a certain stretch of time:
(104) abnentaya
ati‐kka=y
ka‐toro‐ø
ati
maybe
DEM‐MEA=LOC
3SG‐end‐3
DEM
‘Maybe he died in that time.’ (AR‐8MI‐88)
latijsha dula‐ø
ati‐kka=jsha
kokko
mala‐cha‐m
then
do;make‐3 DEM‐MEA=ABL
throw.PL go.SG‐JUS‐2SG.S
‘Then he made [salt], and after that time (she said): “Leave me some.”’
(AR‐8MI‐82)In this sense of time reference, the suffix ‐kka seems less rigid as to the word class of the
root it attaches to. This is probably for semantic reasons: to indicate the size of
something presupposes a root that has some size, while in the temporal sense, it only
presupposes a state or event that is (or can be) durative, even though some speakers
have difficulties interpreting the following words 25:These examples are taken from a traditional song, which not many people know anymore.
Consultants said that the language of traditional songs is somewhat different from everyday
speech. Possibly, the examples in (105) are not very good representatives of what is and what is
not possible in the language.","[137, 138, 139, 140]"
"154Verbal agreement, voice & valencyThe beneficiary reading of the direct object can be observed in the following
instances:
(23) abcti‐n‐dula‐ø
ti‐sibë
1SG‐IO‐do;make‐3 1SG‐house
‘He made me my house.’ [RF‐16MA‐12]
ti‐n‐ewe‐ø
ti‐sibë=y
1SG‐IO‐sweep‐3 1SG‐house=LOC
‘He swept my house for me.’ [MH‐7MA‐3]
ti‐n‐tëptë‐ø
ti‐bëshë
1SG‐IO‐wash‐3
1SG‐entity 6
‘She washed my clothes for me.’ [FL‐10MA‐2]Verbs denoting states, processes or achievements also often carry this applicative. The
indirect object denotes the person that benefits from the state of affairs that has arisen:
(24) abcdti‐n‐duta‐ø
ayma
1SG‐IO‐burn‐3 fire
‘The fire is burning (after I prepared it).’ [AA‐17MA‐2]
ti‐n‐kula‐ø
ti‐chata
1SG‐IO‐boil‐3 1SG‐food
‘My meal is boiling.’ [FP‐16MA‐15]
ti‐n‐sa‐ø=naja
ti‐sawata
1SG‐IO‐finish‐3=DSC 1SG‐work
‘My work is done.’ [VP‐22MA‐8]
nij
ti‐n‐suwita‐ø
ti‐ballata
NEG
1SG‐IO‐come.up‐3
1SG‐plant.seed
‘My plants are not coming up.’ [FL‐10MA‐2]In all of the examples in (24) the indirect object profits somehow from the coming
about of a state. This benefit often has to do with the fact that the indirect object is the
possessor of one of the core participants, a construction known as external possession.
Core instances of external possession are described as “constructions in which a
semantic possessor‐possessum relation is expressed by coding the possessor as a core
grammatical relation of the verb and in a constituent separate from that which contains
the possessum” (Payne & Barshi 1999:3). Note that we are not dealing with possessor
raising here, since the possessor may still be marked on the noun, as is the case in
(24)b‐d.
The indirect object can sometimes also mark a detrimentally affected dative of
interest:
Bëshëë (which loses its final vowel when prefixed with a singular possessive prefix) has a
rather vague meaning, but it is often interpreted as ‘clothing’, sometimes ‘game’ for hunting.","[169, 170]"
"6.3 Mood & modality
As with aspect, many modality distinctions are encoded by means of propositional
enclitics, which will be the topic of the next chapter. Here we are concerned with event
modality, which is “concerned with the speaker’s attitude towards a potential future
event” (Palmer 2001:8).6.3.1 intentional ‐ni
The marker ‐ni indicates an action or state that has not (yet) taken place, which
nevertheless is in many cases an expected or even purposive reality. It has the
following functions:
(39) abcdwish
anu‐ta
i‐jamio‐ni

ti‐jusu‐ø
mi‐n‐dyuju‐ni=ti …
1SG‐want‐3 2SG‐IO‐tell‐INTL=DS
‘I want to tell you…’ (AR‐8MI‐82)In all of these examples the function of ‐ni is slightly different, but they all have in
common that they encode a non‐factual event. In (39)a, ‐ni indicates that we are dealing
with a wish; in (39)b, the /i/ is dropped before the first person plural marker,
exhortative action is marked. In (39)c ‐ni has a similar meaning as in b, but the meaning
can also be purely aspectual, not much different from the near completive marker ‐nishi
discussed in section 6.2:
(40) li‐ti‐ja‐n‐tta‐ma
lumulu aye‐ni
DEL‐1SG‐3SG‐IO‐put‐IMP.SG
warm
vomit‐INTL:1SG.S
‘Put on some warm water for me, I am about to vomit.’ (OR‐19MA‐30)In (39)d, ‐ni marks a presupposed, but not actualized situation. It can often be
translated with the English adverb ‘supposedly’. In (39)e, finally, ‐ni is found as a sort
of subjunctive marker. It is found in complements of verbs of desire, lack, fear etc, that
subcategorize for events that have not taken place yet. For more on this see sections
8.2.1, 8.2.4, and 8.2.7.
Even though ‐ni cannot always be translated as intentional action, I gloss it this way.
Firstly because the intentional reading (commissive and exhortative) is the most
frequently encountered function of ‐ni, but also because other uses of ‐ni can often be
analyzed in this way. For instance some of the occurences where ‐ni marks a
complement:
(41) nijpoydi=la
ma‐alkansa‐ni=ti
can:1SG.S=VAL
3PL‐reach‐INTL=DS
‘I could not, when I intended to reach them.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)NEGFurthermore, the ‘wish’‐reading is only possible in combination with the expressive
marker =yu (women) or =ri (for men).
When ‐ni is combined with a non‐first person, the interpretation is often that the
event is to take place at another location than the current position of the subject
(translocative):197A grammar of Yurakaré(42) abli‐wjwa‐ni‐ø=w 4

‘While you are going to hunt, I’ll cook.’ [FA‐24MA‐16]Imperatives are also often combined with ‐ni, where it also mostly gets the
translocative interpretation:

bëshëë
jungle=DIR go.SG=NVR search‐INTL‐JUS‐2SG.S stuff
‘Go to the jungle and find some [food] there.’ (AR‐8MI‐65)The marker ‐ni on nouns indicates that the entity is foreseen to come into existence:
(44) abmala‐ø=ja
ëwwë‐ø=ya elle
a‐sibë‐ni
go.SG‐3=SS
dig‐3=NVR ground 3SG.P‐house‐INTL
‘He went and dug the ground to make his house‐to‐be.’ (AY‐2NC‐2)

ta‐tiba‐ni=w
3PL‐search‐INTL‐INTL:1SG.S 1PL‐pet‐INTL=PL
‘I am going to go and look for our pets‐to‐be.’ (AR‐8MI‐51)In both examples of (44) there is talk of a future entity, an entity that does not exists as
such yet. In (44)b, the animals that the agent is going to search for already exist, but not
in the function of his pets.
In (44)b there is also a double intentional marker. If the marker ‐ni is followed by
another TMA suffix (including a second ‐ni), its meaning is again translocative:4The locative interpretation might also be due to the delimiter prefix li‐, cf. section 6.4.2.","[211, 212, 213]"
"3.3.3 Verbs
Verbs are prototypically actions: agentive actions involving concrete participants,
having a relatively short duration, and spatially more diffuse than nouns (Givón
2001‐I:52).
The typical function of a verb is the predicative function (Croft 2003:184‐185,
Schachter 1985:9). This is not a distinguishing feature of verbs in Yurakaré,
however. Nouns and adjectives can also function as (stative) predicates without
any overt formal marking that indicates a change in lexical category.
(86) absë=ja
ulë‐y
1SG.PRN=EMPH guayabochi.tree‐1SG.S
‘I was that, I was the guayabochi tree.’ (AR‐8MI‐7)
Arsenio=ja
poropesor‐shta‐ø=la
Arsenio=EMPH teacher‐FUT‐3=VAL
Arsenio will be a teacher.’ [AT‐3MI‐121]Example (86)a is taken from a mythological text in which a Guayabochi tree
changes into a person. Now this person is telling a woman that he was the
Guayabochi tree. The subject sëja is marked with the emphasis marker =ja, which
appears almost exclusively on subjects. Furthermore, the predicate ulëy takes the
subject cross‐reference marker ‐y for first person singular. The word that functions
as a predicate has the notional characteristics of a noun, referring to a concrete,79A grammar of Yurakaréeven specific item. In (86)b the predicate nominal is marked for future tense, a
category normally associated with verbs.
Some predicate nominals can even take applicative prefixes. In the following
examples the affected object applicative (cf. 5.2.4) triggers the interpretation of
detachment in (87)a; in (87)b, the attachment‐reading is caused by the indirect
object applicative (cf. 5.2.3):
(87) abmë=ja
ka‐la‐uli‐m
pa=ja
ka‐la‐uli‐p
2SG.PRN=EMPH 3SG‐AFO‐penis‐2SG.S

li‐ma‐n‐shansha‐shta‐ø
latiji
DEL‐3PL‐IO‐tooth‐FUT‐3
subsequently
‘He provided them with teeth.’ (AR‐8MI‐35)In (87)a, the predicate function is performed by a noun, which also refers to a
concrete and specific object. Like in (86)a, this predicate takes subject cross‐
reference marking (for second person singular and plural) and the overtly
expressed subject argument is marked with the emphasis marker =ja. However, in
(87)a we can also see that the object word can take valency increasing morphology
(the prefix la‐ for affected object ‐ cf. section 5.2.4) and consequently an object
complement, referring to the person who got his penis cut off. In (87)b, the
predicate nominal, not specific this time, takes another kind of applicative and is
modified by an adverb. Furthermore it takes the future tense marker ‐shta.
Adjectives can be used as predicates as easily as object‐words (nouns):
(88) abcmaj~matata‐ø=ya latiji
a‐jukkulë
INTS~big‐3=NVR
subsequently 3SG.P‐field
‘His field was then really big.’ (AR‐8MI‐42)

meme
what‐entity=EMPH
INTS~2SG‐IO‐beautiful‐HAB‐3
mother
‘What do you find really beautiful, mother?’ (AR‐8MI‐50)In (88)a the property word functions as a predicate (cf. the non‐veridical enclitic
=ya, which only attaches to predicates. In (88)b, the property word yita takes the
subject marker ‐p for second person plural, and in (88)c, shuyulë takes the
applicative marker n‐ as well as the habitual marker ‐jti.
Verbs, in short, cannot be distinguished from adjectives and nouns on the basis
of their function as predicates. However, verbs cannot be arguments of predicates
without any overt marking. They can be arguments of verbs either when they80Morphologyform a compound with the noun bëshë ‘entity’ or under a certain analysis with the
different subject marker =ti (cf. chapter 8.2.4):

DEM=DIRbThere is no clear answer to the question whether the ti‐marked clause indicates a
‘when’‐clause rather than a real argument, i.e.: ‘When I had harvested my rice I
was finished.’ However, ti‐marked clauses can take postpositions, which are
normally associated with noun phrases:

‘We could not walk when we were drunk.’ [FA‐28MA‐1]The sequence poyde winanitu seems to be a case where a verb (winanitu), without
any further measures being taken is used as an argument of the verb (Hengeveld’s
1992 criterion). However, on closer scrutiny, there seem to be measures that have
been taken after all. The matrix verb poyde does not carry any subject marking, and
is conjoined to the adjacent VP. In fact, as I will be discussing in chapter 8.2.1, this
is one way of marking subordination. The matrix verb can also be fully inflected,
but then the complement verb has to be marked by means of the enclitic =ti.

of a compound with bëshë (reduced to pshë) ‘entity’. In (93)c we again see that
nouns can be in adjectival function as long as their meaning allows for it:81A grammar of Yurakaré(93) anashunñe bobo‐y=ti

"128The noun phraseDemonstrative pronouns
Yurakaré has three basic demonstrative pronouns. They take normal plural marking
and postpositional marking.
(113) ana
ati
naa‘this’
‘that’ (neutral)
‘that’ (distal)Speakers are very liberal in their use of these three demonstratives. The proximate ana
is generally used for referring to objects near the speaker, but its use may extend to
entities further away, especially when the speaker points or gives some other gestural
cue. Naa is used for reference to entities further away, especially when they are out of
sight. Ati can be used for objects at different distances, especially objects that are closer
to the hearer. In practice, however, the three demonstratives can often be used in
roughly the same situation 26.
Like the personal pronouns, there are some features that distinguish demonstrative
pronouns from other nominal forms. They cannot be possessed, nor can they take the
verbalizer i‐. The most productive affixes on nominally used demonstrative pronouns
are limitative ‐jti and measural ‐kka.
The demonstrative pronouns ana and ati can be prefixed by l‐, which confines the
interpretation of the pronoun to the immediately preceding (anaphorical) or following
(cataphorical) sentence topic or proposition in the discourse, excluding other, more
distant referents:

previously introduced participants; functions which play a clear role in discourse functions of
the demonstratives. Further research is needed to establish this with any certainty.","[143, 144]"

‘The cat came down from the table.’ [FR‐PC]As with =tina and =la above, the use of these markers is extended on the basis of these
core functions. The stative location marker can sometimes also mark the goal of a
movement:

go.up‐3 table 3SG.P‐body=LOC
‘The cat climbed onto the table.’ [FR‐1TA‐4]The marking of a goal with the stative locative marker happens with predicates that
have an inherent direction, like yupa ‘to enter’, dele ‘to fall down’, danda ‘to go up’. This
marking is optional: the complement can also be marked by the directional marker:
(60) Juan yupa‐ø
a‐sib=chi
3SG.P‐house=DIR
Juan go.in.SG‐3
‘Juan entered his house.’ [FR‐PC]There is no difference in the interpretation of a complement marked by =y and a
complement marked by =chi with these movement verbs with inherent direction.
The other way round is also possible: a directional marker marking location. It is not
clear what the difference is between stative locations marked with =chi and =y.

‘John is inside his house.’ [FR‐1TA‐4]inel=chi

2000:104): “(…) languages systematically and extensively refer to stationary111A grammar of Yurakarécircumstances with forms and constructions whose basic reference is to motion. We can
term this constructional fictive motion.”
There are more instances of fictive motion in Yurakaré: the ablative marker can mark
a stative location, and even the goal of a movement in some instances:
(62) abclëtta shunñe li‐tütü‐ø
ayma a‐pasha=jsha

DEL‐sit;be‐3 fire
3SG.P‐bank=ABL
‘One man is sitting next to the fire.’[FR‐1TA‐9]

‘They had eyes on this side (the back of their head)’ (AR‐8MA‐22)
ti‐la‐dyalala‐ø
ti‐tanti=jsha
1SG‐AFO‐spit‐3 1SG‐eye=ABL
‘He spat into my eye.’ [FP‐15MA‐3]If an entity is on the outside of some bounded location, it can be marked by the ablative
marker. So in (62)a, the entity Juan is on the outside of the location fire, and in (62)b, on
the outside of the back of the head, referred to by the demonstrative ana. Example (62)c
has a predicate with inherent direction (yupa, ‘to enter’), so the complement may be
marked as a stative location. Since we are dealing with a figure (mosquito) which is on
the outside of the location (eye), the complement can be marked by the ablative marker
=jsha, even if it marks the goal of a movement.
Another extension of the locational markers =y and =jsha is that they can be used to
derive temporal adverbs:
(63) abcati‐kka=y
DEM‐MEA=LOC
‘in, during that time’
numa=jsha
night=ABL
‘tomorrow’
l‐ati=jsha
REF‐DEM=ABL
‘then, after that’The first example literally means ‘in the size of that’, but can be interpreted as a
temporal adverb, meaning ‘in that stretch of time’. Numajsha ‘tomorrow’ literally
means ‘from the night’, interpreted as ‘after the night’. Latijsha, finally, is a frequently
used discourse‐structuring adverb. The prefix l‐, together with the demonstrative ati,
refers to a previously mentioned event; the ablative marker indicates that the event that
follows occurs subsequently.
The ablative marker =jsha is also used to mark the standard in comparative clauses:112The noun phrase(64) së=ja
tëchi‐kka‐y
më=jsha
1SG.PRN=EMPH tall‐MEA‐1SG.S
2SG.PRN=ABL
‘I am taller than you.’[MH‐7MA‐7]Finally, the ablative marker is used in the following construction (data from Day 1980‐
28):
(65) lëshie=w=jsha
two=PL=ABL
‘one of the two’ [DAY‐1980‐28]As already transpired in some of the above examples, location can be made more
specific by the use of a limited set of relator nouns:

3SG.P‐inside=LOC
‘in the inside of the house’4.3.4 The enclitic =ja
The enclitic =ja is in complementary distribution with the adpositions mentioned
above. It is found almost exclusively on subjects, but it does not mark a grammatical
relation. Firstly because, if it did mark subject, one would expect the marker to be
obligatory, and it is not. Second, it is possible to mark non‐subjects with this marker,
though it is extremely rare:
(69) nama‐wësh‐shunñe‐jti=ja
ka‐chamashi‐ø=w
DEM
3PL‐in.law‐man‐HAB=EMPH
3SG‐control‐3=PL
‘As for their father‐in‐law, they controlled him.’ (OR‐19MA‐3)In almost all cases it is found on grammatical subjects. According to Day (1980), it
serves as a disambiguating subject marker: “[it] marks the subject and must be used
when there might be the slightest ambiguity” (Day 1980‐5). Though this may certainly
be one of its functions, it also appears in sentences where there is no ambiguity at all:
(70) Juan=ja
li‐tütü‐ø
sibbë
inel=chi
Juan=EMPH DEL‐sit;be‐3 house
inside=DIR
‘John is inside his house.’ [FR‐1TA‐4]There is no possible interpretation that the house is inside Juan. It can also appear in
sentences where the marking on the verb in itself is disambiguating enough:
(71) lëtta yee=ja
ti‐n‐wita‐ø
one woman=EMPH
1SG‐IO‐arrive.SG‐3
‘A woman came to me.’ (AR‐8MA‐24)In sentences without any complement it can also appear, even when there is no one to
confuse the subject with:
(72) së=ja
ulë‐y
1SG.PRN=EMPH guayabochi.tree‐1SG.S
‘I was the guayabochi tree.’(AR‐8MA‐7)114The noun phraseAnd it is also used in the following way:
(73) mi‐meme=ja
2SG‐mother=EMPH
‘And your mother? (where is she?)’Its main function is to mark emphatic topics. This is its function in the examples (70)‐
(73). For instance, the context of the myth from which example (72) is taken is that a
man changed from a guayabochi tree into a man, because a woman always scratched
that tree. He appears before the woman and says that he was the one that was the
guayabochi tree (he and no other), which could be translated into English with a cleft
construction: “it was I who was the guayabochi tree”. In (69), where a non‐subject is
marked with =ja there is a switch of topic. In the preceding context the subjects of the
sentence first punished their father‐in‐law for something he did to them, and then they
punish their spouses, then the utterance in (69) follows. Finally, sudden appearances of
participants in a story are often marked with =ja (from the same story):
(74) latijsha maj~matata
wowore=ja
tütü‐ø=ya
püü=y
then
INTS~big
snake=EMPH sit;be‐3=NVR road=LOC
‘Then (suddenly) there was a big snake on the road.’ (AR‐8MA‐77)In conclusion we can say that =ja is a marker of emphatic topic and not of subject.","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"
"4.4 Nouns
Nouns are the heads of noun phrases. In most cases they are the rightmost element of
the NP (disregarding the phrasal clitics discussed in 4.2 and 4.3), but some elements
may appear to the right of the noun within an NP, notably adjectives and relative
clauses. The morphological template of nouns in Yurakaré is as in (75):
(75)posssession-nominal root -other derivationverbalizationI will discuss possession (4.4.1), non‐category‐changing derivation (4.4.2) and category‐
changing derivation (4.4.3), and finally I will make a subclassification of nouns (4.4.4).",[130]
"4.4.1 Possession
Attributive possession is marked on nouns only. It involves a relation between two
nouns. A person prefix is added to the head noun; the dependent noun is not marked.
The possessive prefixes constitute a paradigm which shows some formal similarities115A grammar of Yurakaréwith the free pronouns as well as the object markers. There is no straightforward
synchronic derivational relationship, however:

3plThe sound /t/ in the first person possessive marker can be explained by the fact that the
free pronoun sëë is pronounced [tsQQ], with a slight [t] in the onset. The third person
singular and the plural are not transparently related. As for the prefix a‐ for third
person singular possessive, we can say that the vowel /a/ is present throughout the
demonstrative paradigm, and may have a deictic meaning. The prefix ma‐ may be
related to the word mumuy or mumay, which means ‘all’. The possession paradigm is
also identical to the object paradigm formally, the third person singular being the
exception.
The possessive prefix is obligatory 18, there are one or two instances where the
possessor prefix is absent, but these can be considered exceptions. The possessor is
often lexically expressed, but this is not obligatory. When expressed, the possessor can
occur either before or after the head noun; the order possessor‐possessed is most often
encountered, however:

(AR‐8MI‐16)Example (76)c also shows the recursive possibilities of possession marking, where a
possessed noun (tappëshamaw ‘our grandfathers’) can in turn be a possessor (of
maoshewow ‘their pots’). Possessed nouns can be modified by e.g. adjectives and
numerals:18With the exception of compounded possessive relations.","[130, 131]"
"246Propositional markersQuestions marked with the validational marker are often closed questions,
where the speaker is asking for commitment of the addressee to the truth value of
the proposition. Consider the following question‐answer pair:
(33) abyokkoshe
tiya‐m
meme=la
true
eat‐2SG.S mother=VAL
‘“Did you really eat it, mother?”’ (AR‐8MI‐25)
tiya‐y=la

mu‐ta‐ø=ya
eat‐1SG.S=VAL
eat‐1SG:S=VAL 3PL.CO‐say‐3=NVR
‘“I did eat it, I did eat it!”, she said to them.’ (AR‐8MI‐25)In (33)a the speakers ask for commitment of the addressee to the truth of the
proposition by using the validational marker =la. The addressee then gives them
the commitment by means of the same marker =la in (33)b. The factual status of
the proposition here is that it is not true, as we, the hearers of the narrative know.
The affirmative marker on an imperative, jussive or exhortative adds pertinence
to the assignment. The speaker is commited to the realization of the event,
comparable to English emphasized ‘you have to do this’:
(34) abmala‐cha‐m=la

‘Come on! We have to make [a boat]; the water is going to take us!’ (OR‐20MA‐1)In (34)a, the validational marker is not on the final element of the clause, possibly
to avoid doubling of the syllable la.
The clitic =la does not indicate an absolute value of certainty. It is rather a value
that can be played with when telling a story, making the listeners believe that
something actually did happen (35)a, denying it after that in (35)b:247A grammar of Yurakaré(35) abma‐bobo

conditional, hypothetical, even counterfactual situation:
(36) atika‐puppu‐ta ‐ø
bobo‐ø=ya=chi
laij=la=ye
DEM 3SG‐make.loose‐POT‐3
hit;kill‐3=NVR=IGN too=VAL=NB.F
‘If he had cut that one loose, he would have killed him as well.’ (FA‐6MA‐11)This is perhaps the clearest example to show that =la has nothing to do with
factuality. The speaker knows that the event described in the superordinate clause
of the counterfactual conditional construction is non‐factual, and still the
proposition is marked with =la.
In a similar vein the validational marker can be combined with the speculative
marker ‐jtë and the assumptive marker =tiba:
(37) ablat mapa‐kka‐ø
ati‐kka‐ø=jtë
latiji=la=yu
then big‐MEA‐3
DEM‐MEA‐3=SPC

‘He was big. Probably this size.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)
a‐wështi‐ø=tiba=la=ye
3SG.P‐hunger‐3=ASM=VAL=NB.F
‘He must have been hungry.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)In (37)a the speaker commits herself to her estimation of the height of the character
of the story, and in (37)b the narrator commits herself to her assumption that the
character is hungry.7.2.2 =ri/yu: expressive
The enclitic pair =ri (for men) and =yu (for women) adds an expressive force to an
utterance, which can often be translated with English interjectional phrases like248Propositional markers“for God’s sake”, “for crying out loud” and the like. In the data that I have
collected, these enclitics mainly occur in questions which are furthermore marked
with the speculative marker ‐jtë:
(38) abam=chi
mala‐ø=jtë
latiji=ri
WH=DIR
go.SG‐3=SPC
subsequently=EXPR.M
‘Where (in the world) did he go.’ (AR‐8MI‐59)
ama‐sh‐i‐ø=jtë=yu
WH‐ADV‐VBL‐3=SPC=EXPR.F
‘How will it have been? (I don’t know)’ (DV‐14MA‐3)The combination of ‐jtë and =ri/yu marks the question as an expressive one. No
answer is expected to either of the questions in (38). In (38)a, the narrator of the
story does not know where the main character of the story went, and he knows
that no one has the answer to that question. Example (38)b is from a dialogue
where the speaker and her husband are trying to track down where one of their
plates has gone. After contemplating some of the possibilities, they come to the
conclusion that they do not know what might have happened, and the utterance
in (38)b is her final word.
The enclitics =ri and =yu in questions are also sometimes combined with the
enclitic =bë, which denotes either momentaneous aspect or demanding attention of
the hearer (cf. 7.2.5 below). In the case of a combination of =bë with one of the
expressive enclitics, the question is also expressive, but with the connotation of
pondering, thinking aloud:
(39) abtëtëpshë
kusu‐shta‐ø=bë=ri

WH‐ADV.CMP‐MID 1PL‐IO‐converse‐FUT=MOM
1PL.PRN=EXPR.M
‘What shall we talk about?’ (AA‐27MA‐9)In (39)a, taken from the same dialogue as (38)b, the two speakers are wondering
what I would like to have for lunch. This speaker is asking himself aloud what
would please me. In (39)b, taken from another dialogue, I had left the two
speakers with the minidisk and told them to just go ahead and converse. So the
first speaker asks himself rather than anyone else: “What shall we talk about? (let’s
see)”.
The following utterances show that =ri/yu can be applied in a wider context than
just rhetorical questions:249A grammar of Yurakaré(40) abl‐ati‐jti=ja=la=yu
REF‐DEM‐LIM=EMPH=VAL=EXPR.F
‘But that is the only one there is!’ (DV‐14MA‐2)
buyta‐ni
së=bë=ri
chief‐INTL:1SG.S
1SG.PRN=MOM=EXPR.M
‘If only I were chief!’ [FL‐1MA‐21]The utterance in (40)a is part of the dialogue of the lost plate mentioned before.
This is an answer to a statement made by the other speaker who thinks that they
had two white plates, a plastic one and another one, but his wife says that the
plastic one is the only one they have. In (40)b there is an expression of a wish,
where =ri , possibly in combination with =bë, adds an exclamative value to the
proposition.
Day (1980) has found many more occurrences of =ri/yu. In her analysis, these
suffixes express regret or sorrow:
(41) abbenebene‐sh tuwi‐ø
i‐bonto‐shama=ri
pitiful‐ADV

go.out‐1SG.S‐MOM
before=EXPR.M
‘Why didn’t I go out earlier?’ (regretful) (Day 1980‐32)However, regret and sorrow are too narrow labels to fit to the whole range of uses
of =ri/yu. I will come back to these enclitics and discuss some more environments
in which they occur when discussing combinations of the modal enclitics in 7.3
below.7.2.3 =ra/ye: notable information
There is another set of enclitics that differ according to the gender of the speaker:
=ra (for men) and =ye (for women). The function of these enclitics is also hard to
pinpoint, but they seem to mark the fact that the speaker thinks something is
notable for some reason:
(42) abmedia

tickly‐MID
2SG‐body 2SG.PRN=NB.M
‘Your body is tickly’ (FL‐14MA‐1)250Propositional markersIn (42)a I had told the speaker that they should converse for half an hour. When
during the conversation the speaker starts wondering when it would end, he
reminds his interlocutor that I had said half an hour. In (42)b the speaker touches
the body of his daughter and she starts to laugh, so he remarks that she has a
tickly body. The ‘notable information’ function becomes clearer in the following
example of Day (1980):
(43) matat‐uma‐ø=w=la mesa=w=ye
big‐DST‐3=PL=VAL
table=PL=NB.F
‘What huge tables!’ [DAY‐1980‐32]Sometimes the use of =ra/ye seems to have an epistemic value. It is not clear how
this use is related to the ‘notable information’ use:
(44) rene=tina
bali‐ø=w=ra
Rene=COM go.PL‐3=PL=NB.M
‘They will have gone with Rene.’ (FL‐14MA‐2)7.2.4 =se: repetition/emotion
The enclitic =se has several functions. So many in fact, that it is virtually
impossible to come up with an adequate characterization of the enclitic, therefore I
gloss it ‘SE’.
First of all, =se marks repetition, which is essentially aspectual, and can often be
translated with English ‘again’. In this reading the enclitic seems to be related to
the adverb yosse ‘again’:

I will just show a number the functions of =se that I have found:

=se means ‘again’ and (46), where =se is used in comparisons do not contain the
same morpheme as in (47)‐(60), where =se mainly adds emotional value.
Furthermore, it is not clear how to account for the range of inferences in (47)‐(60).7.2.5 =bë: momentaneous/attention particle
The meaning of the enclitic =bë is hard to pinpoint. It seems to have two different
meanings, and is often used in conversation in various circumstances.
In many circumstances, the particle means ‘for a while’, like in (61)a and b,
indicating that the event will take up only a short while. In this sense it is an
aspectual marker. However, in example (61)c, this interpretation is harder to254Propositional markersmaintain. It rather seems to mean something like getting attention, somewhat like
English ‘hey!’. In this sense it is a particle that functions on the speech‐act level as
an address particle.

sentence. Only in (63)a the speaker directly addresses someone, (63)b and c the
question is rather rhetorical, which does not match with the use of an addressing
particle, nor does there seem to be a straightforward momentaneous
interpretation.
Finally, the enclitic particle is also found on declaratives:

3SG.P‐wife=MOM
‘When he arrived, he gave his wife a beating.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)The interpretation that can be given here is ‘at that specific moment’. This is
especially clear in example (64)b, where the speaker realizes that he has made a
mistake in talking about Tiri at that specific moment in the story, because he had
not been born yet. In (64)a and c, reference is made to a specific, relatively short
period in time where background clauses mark the circumstances associated with
that period of time. In (64)a, during the period that the subject of the background
clause was hitting them, they let the object go; in (64)c, the moment of arriving
coincides with the slapping.
Summarizing, =bë is used to indicate specific points in time, which go with
specific circumstances, or it indicates that the speaker demands attention from the
addressee. Possibly, these two uses are connected in the sense that =bë tells us that
the speaker regards what he says to be relevant for the moment of utterance, but
not in general. However, whether and, if so, how these two uses are related
remains unclear; a definite answer to this question can only be given after
substantial further research.
What can be said, however, is that the form =bë can be found in other words of
the language, like bëbë ‘search’ and bëjta ‘see’, as well as the special attention
demonstrative pronouns bëti and bëna, often used as a sort of presentative (cf.
section 4.4.4). These correlate mainly with the ‘attention’ meaning of bë.7.2.6 =bëla: continuative
The enclitics =bëla and =naja are phasal enclitic particles. Phasal particles express
‘that a state does or does not continue, or that is has or has not come into
existence’ (Van der Auwera 1998:24). The enclitic =bëla indicates that a certain state256Propositional markersof affairs continues to be true or, when attached to a negative clause, that an
expected event still has not been realized. In the first case it can often be translated
with English ‘still’, in the latter case with ‘not yet’. The form =bëla is probably
related to =bë.

‘His brothers had not yet seen him.’
(FA‐6MA‐6)In (65)a and b, there is a declarative sentence marked with the continuative
enclitic, which indicates that the general situation does not change, and the old
one is still valid. In (65)a the situation was and still is that the road has to be built.
It is not finished yet. In (65)b, the speaker is talking about Noah’s journey in his
ark. There is a moment of hope that the water is subsiding, but in the end they
have to continue their journey by boat. In (65)c and d, the negation of the clause
changes the interpretation of =bëla from ‘still’ to ‘not yet’, or ‘still not’. In (65)c,
Noah’s parrot says to him that he can still see no trees coming out of the water,
indicating that the water has subsided. In (65)d the topical participant of the story,
Tiri, has been hidden to escape from the view of his dangerous step‐brothers. At
this point in the story his brothers have not discovered him yet, but they will
shortly.
As can be seen in the examples, =bëla does not always attach to the clause final
element. It is rather free in its placement.7.2.7 =naja: discontinuative
The enclitic =naja, like =bëla is a phasal particle. However, whereas =bëla indicates
that a certain situation is continuing, =naja indicates that a new situation has
arisen, ending the previous state of affairs. It can often be translated with English
‘already’.","[261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272]"

them as single, lexical words, as they are used by speakers as fixed combinations.

situations in the form of ‘and’ or ‘and then’. In this sense it is a coordination
marker. It is also optionally used to coordinate two NPs:

clothes are no longer here.
The form acha(ya) is used for purposive or objective clauses:321A grammar of Yurakaré(115) ablëtta shunñe bëbi‐shti

have a certain advantageous result. The complement that follows achaya is often
marked with ‐cha, but this is not necessarily so. In (115)a the complement is
marked with the future marker ‐shta; the marker ‐ni (intentional) is also possible:

2SG‐want‐3
‘What do you want to eat: fish or fried pieces of dough?’ [FA‐28MA‐1]If there is disjunctive coordination between two clauses or two noun phrases, both
coordinands are preceded by kusuti. This is bisyndetic (Haspelmath 2004:4)
coordination, involving two coordinators.
Kusuti is also used to indicate uncertainty (‘maybe’), cf. section 6.5.3:
(118) kusuti
lëshie domingu‐ø=ti i‐saa‐ø=w=ya
a‐judyu
maybe two
Sunday‐3=DS VBL‐fruit‐3=PL=NVR 3SG.P‐joco:PL
‘After maybe two weeks, his joco’s had fruit.’ (AR‐8MI‐43)I consider this to be the basic meaning of kusuti, which is compatible with its use
as a disjunctive coordinator.
Relative clauses have an encoding strategy alternative to the construction
described in sections 8.2.3 and 8.2.4, involving two balanced clauses, without any
subordinating enclitic. The semantic role of the relativized item is then indicated
on a demonstrative (usually bëti or sometimes ati):322The clause(119) abcdam=chi ka‐bushu‐ø

3SG‐IO‐send:1SG.S 1SG‐pet dog
‘Where is the man that I sent my dog to?’[MH‐24MA‐8]The demonstrative pronoun bë‐ti is a ‘landing site’ for postpositions. Note that in
(119)c and d, the relation between the predicate of the relative clause and the head
of that clause is still indicated on the predicate. The alternation between the
enclitic and free pronoun strategy may point to the fact that the enclitic =ti is
connected to the deictic element ti in ati and bëti.
The demonstrative pronoun strategy is more widely applicable, for instance to
mark reason clauses:
(120) nishotto‐ø=ya
ta‐buyta ati=la
tuwa
nish
riku‐tu
NEG
go.out‐3=NVR 1PL‐chief DEM=INS 1PL.PRN NEG
rich‐1PL.S
‘Our chief did not come out, therefore we are not rich.’ (AR‐8MI‐78)The utterance in (120) is taken from a mythological story, which can be termed the
genesis of the Yurakaré. With the events of this story reasons are given why the
current situation of the Yurakaré Indians is the way it is. One of the events is that
the founding father of the Yurakaré Indians, Tiri, makes the Yurakaré people come
out of a hole in the ground, but the hole closes before the leader of the Yurakaré
can come out, so the Yurakaré are left without leadership. That is the reason that
they are not rich right now.
As for coordination, the simplest strategy possible is used: two juxtaposed
balanced clauses without any element indicating the nature of the combination of
clauses (asyndetic in Haspelmath’s [2004:4] terms):
(121) abayla~la‐y
ajanta~ta‐y
dance~DST‐1SG.S sing~DST‐1SG.S
‘I am dancing and singing.’ [VL‐24MA‐11]This asyndetic strategy is also used for coordinating two NPs, in addition to the
coordinating construction with latijsha ‘then’, discussed above:323A grammar of Yurakaré(122) latijsha na

pëpësu aysa=tina
then
return‐3=PL=NVR DEM
Pëpësu Aysa=COM
‘Then Pëpësu and Aysa returned.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)Although the meaning of =tina here seems quite close to conjunction, in many
cases the two NPs that are associated by means of the postposition =tina are not
entirely coordinate. Therefore it is more fruitful to regard =tina as a comitative
marker rather than a conjunction marker. For more discussion on the postposition
=tina, cf. section 4.3.1. The comitative strategy is not available for the conjunction
of two clauses.","[335, 336, 337, 338, 339]"
"134The noun phraseProper adjectives (attributively used adjectives) hardly receive any morphological
marking. The collective and distributive markers mentioned above are found on
adjectives (but also on quantifying modifiers). Apart from these markers, adjectives can
be marked by the diminutive ‐nñu (partially discussed in section 4.4.2 above), the
amplifier ‐lë (partially discussed in 4.4.3 above) and the intensifier prefix (also found on
verbs), which is a partial reduplication followed by the sound /j/.
‐nñu: diminutive, affection
The suffix ‐nñu is, next to nouns (cf. 4.4.2) also found on some adjectives (and verbs, cf.
6.4.1). To stress the small size of something, the adjective ñuñuju(‐lë) can be marked
with the diminutive marker. Other adjectives, such as shudyulë ‘beautiful’ can also take
the diminutive marker:

is happening:

a‐pumi‐ø
beautiful‐DIM‐ADV INC‐blow‐3
‘He is whistling beautifully.’ (AY‐3NC‐32)‐lë amplification
The suffix ‐lë on an adjective amplifies its meaning:

2SG.PRN=ABL
‘I am older than you.’ [FL‐3MA‐7]135A grammar of YurakaréIn (129)a, the marker ‐lë is found on a derived pronominal measure adjective. This
combination is somewhat lexicalized, since it always means ‘very small’, in spite of the
fact that ana‐kka 27 is neutral with regard to big or small. In (129)b, the verb/adverb idojo,
which in this context is a grammaticalized marker of augmentation, is marked with ‐lë
to amplify its meaning. In (129)c, finally, ‐lë is used in a comparative construction. It is
not obligatory here, so it is not a case of comparative marking; it simply amplifies the
meaning of pëpë ‘old’. The fact that this is a comparative is marked by the ablative
postposition =jsha.
The amplification marker is also found on (pro)nouns and verbs:

combination of morphemes is lexicalized and means ‘close by’.
intensifier reduplicative prefix

reduplicating the stem, followed by ‐j‐:

"7277A grammar of Yurakaréthe role of applied objects differ across extended intransitives and extended
transitives.
With regard to the position of overtly expressed direct objects (preverbal or
postverbal), not much can be said. In transitive verbs the odds are roughly even.
In ditransitive verbs there seems to be a slight preference for the preverbal
position, but the number of occurences is too small to draw any reliable
conclusions. There does seem to be a slight preference for postverbal position for
the applied objects, although, again, the number of instances of ditransitive verbs
is too low to draw firm conclusions.
In most instances (82%), only one or none of the three arguments is overtly
expressed. This can be seen as another instantiation of what Du Bois (2003:68) calls
the One Lexical Argument Constraint:
(18) Avoid more than one lexical core argumentThe idea behind this constraint is that, even if verbs provide in their argument
structure more than one core argument position, only one of them will be used to
introduce a lexical noun phrase. The others are mainly used for referents that have
already been mentioned in the discourse. These latter argument positions are
more often expressed either by pronouns or by zero forms. As with two‐place
verbs, in three‐place verbs, the position of the direct object is the preferred
position to introduce new referents. This apparently is a pervasive pattern in
discourse throughout the languages of the world.","[292, 293]"
"The Noun PhraseNominal morphology and syntax can be best understood by studying the Noun Phrase
(NP) as a whole. Some morphological categories concern the entire NP rather than just
one of its parts, and other operations (e.g. modifier floating) can only be understood
with reference to the NP as a whole. I will first give a general overview of the NP in
Yurakaré (4.1), then continue to describe the number enclitic =w (4.2) and
postpositional clitics (4.3). In 4.4 I will discuss the head of the NP, the noun; in 4.5 I will
discuss adjectives, including quantifiers, numerals and adjectivally used
demonstratives.",[106]
"4.2 Number
Number in Yurakaré has two basic values: singular and plural. Singular is unmarked,
while plural is normally marked by the enclitic =w, which minimally appears on the
last element of the NP:Discontinuous NPs are a frequently observed feature in languages with a flexible word order
(Givón 2001‐II:13).
4 I consider this construction to be an applicative construction with a comitative object, cf.
section 5.2.1.

‘I have two brothers.’ [MH‐8MA‐3]It is not clear how (9) should be analyzed. We may be dealing with a simple noun
phrase with clitic copying, but we could also analyze either one of the words in (9) as
verbs, since the ending =w is also found on verbs as the marker for 3rd person plural
subject, and non‐verbs can be used as predicates without any overt derivational
marking (cf. section 3.3.3).

‘There are two, they are brothers’Example (9) could have all the interpretations of (10) 5. We cannot say with certainty
whether the construction in (9) represents clitic doubling or not. However, since the
final element is the minimally marked element, I consider the marker =w to be an
enclitic.
Not all noun phrases can be marked for plural:
(11) lëshie sibbë(*=w)
two
house(*=PL)
‘two houses’It is not clear, however, what determines which nouns can be marked for plural.
Typological literature suggests that animacy frequently interacts with number marking
(cf. Corbett 2000: 55‐66). Cross‐linguistically, elements that are higher on the animacy
hierarchy (Figure 1) are more likely to mark the opposition between singular and
plural than elements lower on the scale.","[108, 109]"

which the speaker mixes up the main characters of the story and then finds out
about her mistake. She then continues to set things straight by explicitly stating
the roles that the main characters have. The subjects of (22)d‐f are pre‐verbal and
in contrastive focus.
In general, then, we can say that VS is the pragmatically more neutral order;
preposing a subject gives some kind of emphasis to it. The fact that the pre‐verbal
position is pragmatically marked is corroborated by the fact that question words
are always sentence‐initial, regardless of their semantic or syntactic role (more
discussion on questions in the next section):

Typological research in the past decades has revealed some rather strong
correlations between sentence word order and the order of words in other
constructions. In Table 50 I give Greenberg’s (1963) list, taken from Payne
(1997:72):281A grammar of YurakaréTable 50 - Word order correlations in Greenberg 1963, taken from Payne 1997:72

Nevertheless, these correlations are not very convincing and can never be

Generally, preverbal objects are pragmatically marked as well:

who used his magic to transform into jungle animals all kinds of objects and
creatures that he encountered during his wandering, so that the Yurakaré would
have meat. In the second line, the object ati amumuy is preposed, because it is a
marked topic, with a deictic function, referring back to the topic of the previous
sentence.
In the following fragment, the object is emphasized (stressed) and fronted in the
final sentence of the example:282The clause(25) F

objects can also refer to new and unpredictable information, but objects with extra
emphasis (focus), whether direct or applied, are found in preverbal position. The
fact that applied objects have a slight preference for being postverbal can be
explained by the fact that they are usually very topical (cf. Van Gijn 2005).
The emphatic function of the preverbal position can also be seen in examples
such as the following, where the object NP is discontinuous (cf. section 4.1), the
modifier being in preverbal position, while the head noun is in postverbal
position:
(26) lëshie=w ma‐bëjta‐y
shunñe=w
two=PL
3PL‐see‐1SG.S man=PL
‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]This construction gives emphasis to the quantifier, while the head noun is
presented as a specification, or afterthought, possibly but not necessarily after a
pause. The quantifier is also stressed.
Not very often both object and subject are overtly expressed. In the instances
where this was the case, I have encountered four word orders in texts:283A grammar of Yurakaré(27) abcdtostosma‐che‐ø=ya na

‘Aysa was looking for sabalo.’ (OR‐19MA‐11)I have found no instances of SOV or OSV. The reason that these are rare seems to
be connected to the tendency in the Yurakaré main clause for the verb to be
preceded by only one constituent. In analyzing the first 85 clauses of a text, I have
encountered only three instances where the verb was not in second or first place in
the clause. All kinds of constituents can precede the verb. In (27)a two ideophonic
particles precede the verb; in (27)b and c, two elements precede the verb. Consider
(28), where some other elements that can precede the verb are given:

initial or second position, preceded by all kinds of elements. In some instances, the
verb is in third place. This is also the case in the examples in (27)b and c. In these
circumstances, the first element is always a kind of setting marker, like latijsha
‘then’ pënchi ‘later’ ati ‘there’. These are elements that have a scope which is on the
level of the proposition. Subordinated clauses are also often in this position, often,
like setting words (adverbial elements setting the stage for a main event), marked
by an intonation break:

different internal word‐order, generally. Overtly expressed arguments mostly
precede the predicate in these types of clauses:

‘Then Tiri felt sorry for the old agouti when he saw her.’ (AR‐8MI‐47)Leaving aside subordinated clauses, the data suggest that Yurakaré main clause
structure is V‐initial, with two positions before the verb, one position for setting
words, followed by an emphasis position, then followed by the verb. If we look at
how the elements after the verb are ordered, there is not a clear pattern, but
generally the most topical, known information is found rightmost. Adverbs and
adjuncts can intervene; adverbs related to the event are generally adjacent to the
verb, either to the left or to the right (cf. section 6.5.9 above). The following is a
continuous text fragment from the beginning of a text:285A grammar of Yurakaré(33) abcdetütü‐ø=ya

‘He carried with him a very small basket, this Pëpësu.’ (AY‐3NC‐6)Clause (33)a of the fragment is an existential‐presentative construction. The
subject, as expected, is in postverbal position. The adverb shinama generally
appears right after the verb. In (33)b the main new information in the form of an
adjunct is postverbal. The same adjunct in (33)c is the final element and old
information. The new information is the combination pëpëshamaw lacha, which
comes before the old information. In (33)d, the subordinate clause is preposed,
followed by a setting‐word latijsha and a preverbal subject with an extra emphasis
marker =ja introduces a new topic. In (33)e, finally, the emphasized element
anajalima is taken out of the object NP and positioned in the preverbal position.
The new object awerta comes right after the predicate, while the old information na
pëpësu is the final element. The template of the main clause, then, roughly looks as
in (34). Note that these are not absolute positions, but rather tendencies in the
clause.
(34) (setting), emphasis, VP (pred. + adverbs), new information, topic, afterthought8.1.7 Negative and interrogative clauses
Negative clauses are marked by the negative adverb nish, with phonetic variant nij
(to negate a predicate or VP) or by the form nij‐ta (NEG‐MID; existential negation).
Nish/nij normally immediately precedes the predicate it negates:Aysa and Pëpësu are two characters that are closely connected in this story in which they
work together. The reason the narrator started the story with Aysa is probably because I
asked him to tell the story of Aysa.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301]"

"4151A grammar of Yurakarénot have a controlling agent. Moreover, the event of seeing can be, and often is
punctual. It is not absolutely clear why (14)b should be ungrammatical, but it might
have to do with a natural endpoint for the verb danda ‘to go up’, which is moslty used
for describing someone climbing a tree, where the top is the natural endpoint.
Nevertheless, a situation like the one in (14)b is perfectly imaginable, and it is not
entirely clear why this should be ungrammatical.
The following causatives can be marked for cooperative object:
(15) abku‐bache‐ø
3SG.CO‐leave.CAU‐3
‘He sent him as well, made him go with another.’ [DV‐12MA‐25]
ku‐wiliche‐ø
3SG.CO‐return.CAU‐3
‘He sends him back with him.’ [FP‐14MA‐20]The difference between (14) and the examples in (15) is that in the latter examples, the
underlying predicate of effect has a controlling agent, and is a more prototypical
example of an activity.
Another case – like the causative examples – where the coordination concerns the
direct object rather than the subject is the following:
(16) ku‐bëjta‐y
3SG.CO‐see‐1SG.S
‘I see him with what he has.’ [DV‐12MA‐25]The example in (16) is of a unique type. It represents an exception to the tendency
stated above that verbs should be prototypical activities. Notionally, the cooperative
object is rather deviant as well, it does not conform to the prototype interpretation of
cooperative object.
Spanish verbs that have been adapted to the system of Yurakaré can sometimes also

‘You are angry with me.’Even though the participants do not have the same role, they do have a complementary
role, and one can say that the event expressed by the predicate is a joint effort in a way
of the subject and the cooperative object. The verb ta with the cooperative object
prefixes can be contrasted with the same verb without these prefixes:

‘“Ayay! Ayay! The bees are eating me!”, our grandfather Tiri said.’ (AR‐8MI‐52)In (19), the speaker does not share his information with anyone, it is an expressive
statement. As soon as the speaker is speaking with someone, the cooperative object
prefixes appear. In that sense we are dealing with a joint effort. The same can be said
for ite ‘ask’. However, as we will see in section (5.2.3), addressees are generally
encoded as indirect objects in Yurakaré. The predicate dyojlo is much harder to analyze
in this way. I have no clear explanation for this at this point.
In conclusion, even though the term ‘cooperative object’ does not fit neatly to all
instances, I still consider it to be the core notion of which the other uses are somehow
derived. It may be that further research will lead to a higher level of abstraction that
will better fit all uses.","[166, 167, 168]"
"8.1.5 Ditransitive verbs
Ditransitive verbs are of two types: extended transitives (17)a, and doubly
extended intransitives, (17)b:276The clause(17) abti‐ma‐la‐che‐ø=w ti‐petche=w

‘“Go and get them for me!”, she said to him.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)In (17)a, the verb che ‘eat’ has a basic valence of two (i.e. a subject and a direct
object, and to this is added a third, applied argument, an affected object (cf. section
5.2.4). In (17)b, the verb mala ‘go’, is a one‐place verb. In (17)b, there is also an
indirect object and a purposive object (cf. section 5.2.5), extending the valency to
three.
Ditransitives do not occur frequently in texts. They constitute only about 4.2% of
all predicates. Almost all instances I encountered in the texts were combinations of
a direct object with an applied object (89%). The subjects of these verbs are overtly
expressed in 82.3% of all cases. This is roughly equivalent with subjects of
transitive and extended intransitive verbs. In Table 45 above I collapsed the group
of applied objects and direct objects. If we look at their behavior separately in
ditransitives, we get the following picture:
Table 48 - Direct objects (O) and applied objects (E) in ditransitive verbs
%OV %VO %Vo %EV %VE %Ve
28.26 17.39 54.35 4.35
6.52
89.13
Applied objects are dropped much more often than direct objects. The percentages
are comparable to O‐drop in transitive predicates and E ‐drop in extended
intransitive predicates:

The percentages of direct object drop are not far apart (58.4% for transitives, 54.4%
for ditransitives). The same holds for the dropping of applied objects: 82.7% in the
case of extended intransitives, 89.1% in the case of ditransitives. It seems that the
role of direct objects does not differ in ditransitive and transitive verbs, nor does
To be able to compare like with like, I have disregarded instances of doubly extended
intransitives, i.e. a one place predicate with two applied objects. In practice this appeared
to be only a small number; by far most instances were combinations of a direct object and
an indirect object.","[291, 292]"
"1342Phonology2.4.5 Diacritically marked roots
There are some roots that do not respect the stress‐attracting prefixes, without
heaviness of syllables playing a role. These are often Spanish loans, and I consider
them to have diacritically marked feet.

the Spanish original, where stress is final. There are also roots that carry their main
stress on a syllable where it is not predicted from the above rules:

longer transparent.","[57, 58]"
"8.1.3 Transitive verbs
As far as subjects of the transitive verb (A) are concerned, we see that they are left
unexpressed much more often than intransitive subjects (S), cf. 8.1.1 above. The
fact that overtly expressed noun phrases appear more freely in intransitive subject
or direct object roles (O) than in transitive subject role is a universal tendency,
which “is evidenced widely in the spontaneous discourse of virtually all
languages investigated to date” (Du Bois 2003:48). This phenomenon has to do
with the fact that new information is typically expressed in either intransitive
subject or transitive object role, positions more salient than the transitive subject
position.
As far as the position of overtly expressed subjects is concerned, there is a slight
tendency for A to favor the postverbal position. Nevertheless, this preference is
much weaker than in intransitive verbs, where 85.3% of all overtly expressed S‐
arguments is realized in post‐verbal position, whereas only 55.8% of all overt A‐
arguments of inherently transitive verbs is expressed post‐verbally. This
difference can possibly be attributed to the emphatic function of the preverbal
position, as will be discussed in section 8.1.6.
The percentage of direct objects left unexpressed (58.4%) is comparable to the
percentage of non‐expressed S‐arguments (62.5%) in intransitives. This fact seems
to support the claim that, as far as information‐structure goes, the S‐position and
the O‐position have similar functions: they are equally equipped for introducing
new linguistic material.
The position of overt O’s is rather unpredictable, in the sense that there does not
seem to be a clear preference for either preverbal or postverbal O’s. I will discuss
this matter in section 8.1.6.",[290]
"1267A grammar of YurakaréPredicates with a valence of one can be divided into intransitive verbs and non‐
verbal predicates. These two categories are not formally distinct. Still, I consider
them to be separate categories, since with regard to non‐verbal predications, it is
often difficult to say what is the word order exactly, VS or SV. This is because it is
not always clear which of the two elements is the predicate and which the
argument, hence the high percentage of unanalyzable non‐verbal predicates in
Table 45. As Payne (1997:83) says: “(…) the probability of mistakenly including
predicate nominals in a study of constituent order is quite high (especially if the
language uses a zero copula element in predicate nominals).” Predicates with a
valency of two can be divided into inherently transitive and derived transitive
predicates, or extended intransitives. It is useful to distinguish these two, since, as
will become apparent below, they behave differently in some respects.
In the remainder of this section I will discuss the types of predicates mentioned
in Table 45: intransitive verbs (8.1.1), transitive verbs (8.1.3), extended intransitive
verbs (8.1.4), ditransitive verbs (8.1.5), and non‐verbal predicates (8.1.2). In 8.1.6, I
will discuss word order from an overall perspective; in 8.1.7, finally I will briefly
discuss interrogative and negative sentences.","[282, 283]"

in (26), since examples (27)a and b also have a separation meaning; on the other hand
the examples in (26) might also be explained as cases of detrimental affect. Similar to
the indirect object, many of these instances of malefactive/detrimental affect can be
analyzed as external possessors. External possession is certainly a subtype of the
affected object. Nevertheless, like the indirect object, the affected‐object applicative has
a wider use. Apart from the already mentioned use as a marker of entities undergoing
separation, the affected object also marks locations which are used for some purpose,
or entities being located in such a way that they are affected or bothered by the event,
either consciously or unconsciously:

‘He smoked on me (e.g. blew his smoke into my face).’ [FA‐2MA‐8]As can be seen in (28)a, where the cross‐referencing prefix licensed by the presence of
the marker la‐ refers to kummë ‘tree’, the affected object does not need to be animate,
which makes the construction slightly different from the typical ethical dative, which is
always animate (Fried 1999:492). Nevertheless, in Yurakaré too, affected objects are in
almost all cases animate.
As mentioned in the previous paragraph, sometimes the distinction between indirect
objects marking beneficiaries and affected objects marking detrimentally affected
participants evaporates. This can be seen in (29), which is a repetition of (25) above:157A grammar of Yurakaré(29) abcti‐m‐bititë‐ø

that affected objects and indirect objects in these circumstances are exactly the same. If
there is a difference, it is indeed a very subtle one. At this point it is not possible to tell
the difference.
A final point to be made about the affected object is that, instead of adding an
argument to the existing arguments, it can also rearrange the valency of a transitive
root:

stingray
‘The stingray is stinging me’ [MA‐7MA‐3]In (30)a, the normal, bivalent use of the verb duya ‘sting’ is illustrated. Example (30)b
shows an extension of the valency from two to three. Both the direct object and the
affected object are marked on the verb (for a discussion of combinations of argument
marking on the verb, cf. section 5.2.8). The prefix ti‐ refers to the affected object, the
prefix ma‐ to the direct object. In (30)c the verb is still bivalent after the application of
the affected object, but the action is interpreted as being progressive. Telicity is one of
Hopper & Thompson’s (1980:252) components of transitivity. Atelic verbs are lower on
the transitivity scale than telic verbs, so in a way, the transitivity of the verb seems to
be relatively diminished by the applicative in this case 8. There is an incompletive
marker (discussed in section 6.2.1), which is the prefix a‐. A transitive verb which is
marked for incompletive aspect can only take generic direct objects, and can also
appear without any direct objects. It is possible – but impossible to prove empirically –
Wise (2002:330‐331) reports both valency increase and decrease functions for one and the same
applicative in Chayahuita and possibly also Iquito.","[171, 172, 173]"
"5153A grammar of YurakaréThis applicative construction has several related meanings. First, with verbs of
movement or caused‐movement verbs such as ‘giving’, ‘sending’ and the like, it
indicates the goal of that movement, or the recipient.

party, often called ‘ethical dative’, ‘dative of (dis)advantage’ or ‘dative of interest’ (cf.
Payne 1997:192‐194, Palmer 1994:32). Semantically, an ethical dative construction can
be described as follows: “The circumstances described by the predicate have significant
consequences for the interested party, whose referent is not in control of the event”
(Fried 1999:492). The type of interest that is indicated by this kind of construction can,
in many languages be either beneficiary or adversative, without any formal distinction
(cf. Shibatani 1994:463). In Yurakaré, however, these two subtypes of the ethical dative
have different formal encodings, with which they more or less coincide. The ‘indirect
object’ encoding, with the prefix n‐, is by and large associated with goal/approach and
beneficiary, while the ‘affected object’ encoding, with the prefix la‐ which is discussed
in section 5.2.4 below, is associated with source/separation and adversity.","[168, 169]"

‘While we were fighting, he hit me.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]In (70)b, the subject of the main verb is coreferent with the object of the dependent
clause. This may have to do with the fact that we are dealing with an empty
subject, or possibly a subjectless predicate. The object here indicates the
experiencer. The event is presented and defined from his viewpoint: the moment
of lëjëlë is determined by the moment the experiencer wakes up. This is a crucial
difference with example (72), where the event of raining – also with an empty
subject 27 – happens independently from the experiencer, so that the different
subject marker =ti (cf. section 8.2.4) appears.

‘When it was going to be morning I fell out of bed.’ [RF‐30MA‐6]Another often mentioned characteristic of clause chaining is that there is a fully
inflected verb at the end of a string of verbs. All foregoing verbs are marked for
whether they have a different or the same subject as that final verb. Even though
the dependent =ja clause usually precedes the main clause, this is not obligatory:

unmarked for tense. In the case of the =ya clauses both events would take place in
the future relative to the temporal anchor. The translation would be: ‘they were
going to go and meet him’. In (75)b, the main event is marked for intentional, but
the =ja marked dependent clauses are not marked for TMA, and they are not
interpreted as intentional. Whereas the temporal, aspectual and modal
information of the ya‐clause is relative to the TMA information of the main verb,
the situation is different with the ja‐clauses: both the main event and the ja‐clause
have their own independent organization of TMA. Schematically, this can be
represented as follows:

speaker is the subject of the ja‐clause and the main clause entails a command and
has the addressee as its subject. The subject of the ja‐clause is expressed overtly –
in this case by the pronoun së – but does not trigger agreement. The main verb is
fully inflected. Possibly the construction exemplified in (76) can be analyzed as
having an abstract non‐expressed speech event triggering the same subject
marker. It seems that the dependent ja‐clause cannot carry any TMA information
either in this construction. If it does carry TMA markers in a similar construction,
the different subject marker =ti is called for:

wita=ya

INC‐cook‐JUS‐2SG.S

conditional clause are different in (76)b, while they are the same in (78).
Subordinate clauses marked with =ja are mainly used to encode temporal
adverbial clauses, as has been shown by a number of the examples discussed
above. Because of the fact that the ja‐clause retains all possibilities for TMA
marking and other modification by means of derivational morphology or adverbs,
ja‐clauses can express anterior, simultaneous and posterior events, relative to the
main event. The default temporal interpretation of the ja‐clause is that the ja‐
marked predicate expresses the event that occurred first. However, there are ways
to create a co‐temporal interpretation, e.g. through the use of the incompletive
prefix a‐ on the =ja‐marked predicate in (79)a, or by the phasal adverb kaj in (79)b:308The clause(79) aba‐tiya‐tu=ja

As mentioned above, the absolutive‐like constructions with =ja discussed above
(i.e. without person marking and TMA in the subordinate clause) can be
interpreted as conditional clauses:

‘predator of the water’Tiba‐ta is often translated with the word dueño ‘boss, owner’, in the sense that these
tibata have a protective function in relation to their possessors.
The examples in (86) relate to the metaphorical extension function of the middle
marker. A cigarette case is not really a house, but from the perspective of the cigarettes
(which, incidentally are also marked with ‐tA, this time in the instrument function) it
can be said to be a house 18. The same holds, mutatis mutandis, for example (86)b:
(86) abbishmi‐ta
a‐sibë‐të
smoke‐MID 3SG.P‐house‐MID
‘cigarette case’
a‐nñu
a‐sibë‐të
3SG.P‐child 3SG.P‐house‐MID
‘womb (the house of her child)’With some nouns, the middle marker can have the effect of deriving nouns of the
type former‐X:
(87) a
b
c
dti‐sibë
ti‐jukkulë
bashti
ti‐ñaba‘my house’
‘my field’

ti‐jukkulë‐të ‘my former field’
ti‐bashta‐ta ‘my former wife’
ti‐ñabaw‐ta ‘my former sister‐in‐law’ 19Note that sibë‐të can either mean ex‐house or a metaphorical extension of the concept ‘house’.
In this case only the latter interpretation is exemplified.
19 I have no explanation for the deviant form of the root here (ñabaw instead of ñaba) or in the
previous example (bashta instead of bashti).
18175A grammar of YurakaréThe heterogenous effects of the middle marker may be due to the probable
diachronic source for the marker, the verb ta ‘say’. This verb is found in a number of
grammaticalized contexts that seem to be related to the different domains of the
middle marker.
Firstly, the verb ta is often combined with ideophones, in the following way:
(88) aporrok porrok ta‐ø=ya
IDEO
say‐3=NVR
‘“porrok porrok”, they went (hoofs of tapirs).’ (AR‐8MI‐68)
dürrüm ta‐ø=ya
IDEO
say‐3=NVR
‘“brooom” it went.’ (AR‐8MI‐67)
tip
ku‐ta‐ø=ya
IDEO
3SG.CO‐say‐3=NVR
‘“tip”, it went (milk dripping).” (AR‐8MI‐23)IDEObcSome of the middle‐marked forms seem to have arisen directly from this structure:
(89) a
b
c
d
d
ebüsüjta
‘get/be torn’
botejta
‘get/be untied’
adyajta
‘run’
worejta
‘get/be turned over’
posojto
‘explode’
shëdëdëjta ‘cough’(büsük = ideophone denoting tearing) 20
(botek = ideophone for being set free)
(adyaj = ideophone for ‘go fast’)
(worek = ideophone for upside down’)I did not find an ideophone (i.e. without ‐tA) for the last two examples, but I list them
here because they are clearly sound symbolic. Ideophones almost always combine with
verbs which they modify or describe. However, the forms marked with ‐ta are mostly
used independently.
Ideophones in Yurakaré usually relate to the participant that undergoes a change of
state (e.g. in (89)a: ‘“büsük”, it says’ relates to the entity being torn. This means that the
use of the verb ta in these constructions is connected, i.e. it shares semantic features
with the agentless passive, spontaneous events and for instance, some translational
motions, such as adyajta ‘run’ in (89)c. In Kemmer’s network analysis, passive and
spontaneous events are connected to reflexive uses, which are in turn connected to
reciprocal and other areas mentioned above. Some of the instruments in (83) above
might well be connected to this ideophone + ta construction as well, though in a more
opaque way than the passive and spontaneous events. It is especially clear with forms
The sound /k/ is disallowed in coda position in Yurakaré, but ideophones are often deviant in
this respect. However, even with ideophones /k/ is only allowed in coda position word‐finally.
When suffixed with ‐ta, this /k/ changes into /h/, spelled j.","[187, 188, 189, 190, 191]"
"20297A grammar of Yurakarépredicates behaves as a VP‐conjunction, evidenced by the fact that the subject
marking disappears. The ‘experiencer’ of the predicate pëlë is encoded as an
indirect object, and the cross‐reference prefix is not deleted under co‐reference,
just like shujuta ‘sweat’, lit. ‘be hot’ in example (54)b, where the experiencer is
expressed as a cooperative object. Examples (58)a and b show the same
phenomenon with the verb ile/yle ‘know’:

‘I don’t know where he is going.’ [FL‐24MA‐1]In (58)a the predicate yle ‘know’ has a nominal complement. In (58)b the same
predicate has a sentential complement with the structure of a VP‐conjunction.
Note that the scope of the future marker extends over both predicates. In (58)c,
there is a sentential complement marked with the subordinating and nominalizing
enclitic =ti and the postposition =la.
Within the group of complement‐taking verbs, there are a number that cannot
encode their sentential complements as conjoined VPs. Some, like ile ‘know’ in
example (58) can either take a sentential complement marked with =ti or as a
conjoined VP. Finally, the verb pëlë ‘finish’ can only take a conjoined VP as its
complement:

"5.2.6 Verbs beginning with /i/160Verbal agreement, voice & valencyTransitive verbs beginning with the sound /i/ usually mark their direct object in a
deviant way. First and second persons and the third person plural are encoded as an
indirect object:
(36) abcdti‐n‐dëjta‐m
1SG‐IO‐miss‐2SG.S
‘You miss me.’ [MH‐8MA‐14]
lëshie=w ma‐n‐du‐shti
palanta=w

banana=PL
‘I am going to fry two bananas.’ [FL‐23MA‐1]

1SG‐IO‐molest‐PROH
‘Don’t bother me!’ [FL‐23MA‐1]
së=ja
ma‐n‐ñese‐shti
palanta=w
1SG.PRN=EMPH 3PL‐IO‐sow;plant‐FUT:1SG.S banana=PL
‘I am going to plant bananas.’ [FL‐20MA‐27]Underlyingly, all of the verb roots in (36) begin with the vowel /i/: idëjta ‘to miss’, idu
‘to fry’, idumaja ‘to molest’ and iñese ‘to sow, plant’. The participant encoded as an
indirect object here is slightly different from normal indirect‐object marking. The third
person singular is cross‐referenced with zero, i.e. as a ‘normal’ direct object, which is
evidence that we are in fact not dealing with indirect objects, but rather with direct
objects that are marked in a deviant manner:
(37) abidu‐ma

fry‐IMP.SG
‘Fry a banana!’ [HC‐23MA‐3]
ëshë idumaja‐shta‐m=chi
mi‐tëjte
why molest‐FUT‐2SG.S=IGN 2SG‐grandmother
‘Why are you going to bother, cause trouble to your grandmother?’ (AR‐8MI‐46)Apparently there is some rule that says that the direct objects of transitive verb roots
beginning with /i/ are encoded as indirect objects, except for third person singular.
When for instance a beneficiary or a recipient is added, this is expressed as an affected
object:
(38) ti‐l‐idu‐ma
1SG‐AFO‐fry‐IMP.SG
‘Fry it for me!’ [FL‐23MA‐1]The affected object applied to a verb beginning with /i/ differs slightly in form, in that
the /a/ of the prefix la‐ is dropped:161A grammar of YurakaréHowever, there are instances where the indirect object does indicate a beneficiary, as
in the case with idu ‘fry’:
(39) ti‐n‐du‐ma
1SG‐IO‐fry‐IMP.SG
‘Fry it for me!’ [FL‐23MA‐1]It may be that the pragmatically marked meaning that a direct object interpretation
would yield here, forces the indirect object interpretation. Nevertheless, it is unclear
what the difference is between (38) and (39). In most cases the affected object takes over
the ‘vacancy’ left open by the indirect object, marking beneficiary/recipient‐type
participants:
(40) abcdti‐l‐irepu‐ø
1SG‐AFO‐tie‐3
‘He tied it for me.’

other verbs:

Experiencers can be encoded in several ways, depending on the verb stem. Some are
encoded as subjects:162Verbal agreement, voice & valency(42) abma‐bëjta‐y
3PL‐see‐1SG.S
‘I see them.’
të‐dyojlo‐m

several ways depending on the verb semantics:
(43) abcdma‐yle

‘They know it.’
ti‐jusu
1SG‐want
‘I want it.’
ti‐n‐kukku
1SG‐IO‐nice

ti‐la‐ñolele
1SG‐AFO‐desirable
‘I desire it.’(comitative object) 9(direct object) 10(indirect object)(affected object)Some impersonal weather verbs can carry cooperative‐object experiencers, like
experiencers of temperature:
(44) abtë‐dyummë‐ø
1SG.CO‐cold‐3
‘I am cold.’
ku‐shujuta‐ø
3SG.CO‐warm‐3
‘He is warm, sweating.’ [AA‐12MA‐28]Cooperative objects can also be sympathetic experiencers:An alternative analysis would be that we are dealing with a verb le with a purposive object.
This would mean that we should analyze le as a movement verb. There is one other cognitive
verb that is based on a movement verb:
i. ku‐y‐mal‐uma‐ø
3SG.CO‐VPL‐go.SG‐DST‐3
‘He is thinking.’
10 The fact that we are dealing with a direct object here is evidenced by the fact that a third
person singular is cross‐referenced by a zero form.
9163A grammar of Yurakaré(45) të‐benebene‐ø
1SG.CO‐lamentable‐3
‘I am sympathizing with him, who is pitiful.’ [HC‐22MA‐6]Experiencers that undergo some emotion because they evaluate something as being
e.g. beautiful are often encoded as indirect objects:
(46) abti‐n‐kukku‐ø
1SG‐IO‐nice‐3
‘I like it.’
ti‐m‐pëlë‐ø
1SG‐IO‐finished‐3
‘I finished it.’Whereas the experiencers in (46) have control over the situation, especially in (46)b,
experiencers that lack any control are generally marked as affected objects:
(47) abti‐la‐ñolele‐ø
1SG‐AFO‐desirable‐3
‘I want it, I feel desire for it’
li‐ti‐la‐sheta‐ø
DEL‐1SG‐AFO‐lost‐3
‘I forgot it (it escaped me).’There is one predicate that I am aware of that takes a direct object as an experiencer:
(48) ti‐jusu‐ø
1SG‐want‐3
‘I want it.’The question with all of these verbs is whether they are one‐place verbs with non‐
canonically marked subjects, or two place verbs of the type of English ‘please’ in ‘It
pleases me.’ The answer to this question can only be given for some of these predicates.
The predicate kukku ‘(be) nice’ is a word describing a property, which can be used as a
one‐place predicate:
(49) abnishkukku‐ø=ya
latiji
na
yee
NEG
nice‐3=NVR

‘She did not feel good then, this woman.’(AR‐8MI‐15)
kukku‐jti‐ø ana‐kki
nice‐HAB‐3 DEM‐MEA:LOC
‘That is a nice stretch [to go].’(AA‐27MA‐10)164Verbal agreement, voice & valencyKukku can also carry other subject markers than third person singular:
(50) ti‐n‐kukku‐m
1SG‐IO‐nice‐2SG
‘I like you.’ [FL‐3MA‐5]Other experiencer predicates behaving like this are, among others: ñolele ‘desirable’,
sheta ‘lost’ pëlë ‘finished’, benebene ‘lamentable’, shujuta ‘hot’, and dyummë ‘cold’.
Problematic for this analysis are kusu 11 ‘want’ and ile ‘know’. These verbs do not
occur as one‐place predicates, nor do they take any phonetically salient subject
markers 12, a fact which renders an analysis as two‐place predicates problematic. These
verbs are probably best analyzed as impersonal verbs or as one‐place verbs with non‐
canonically marked subjects. In fact, Malchukov (in prep.) suggests that constructions
with non‐canonically marked subjects can in fact come about as reanalyses of
impersonal constructions. This historical change may be corroborated by the fact that
Day (1980‐40) 13 marks the following utterances as grammatical:
(51) abnishta‐jusu‐m
NEG
1PL‐want‐2SG.S
‘We do not want you.’
tëtë kanta=w=ja
pa‐yle‐ø=w
what song‐PL=EMPH 2PL‐know‐3=PL
‘Which songs do you (pl) know?’When confronted with these examples, consultants rejected them as ungrammatical. It
may be that in the regions I worked the construction has been reanalyzed.
I should also mention a handful of examples where the experiencer is a possessor (cf.
also section 4.4.1):Kusu is the underlying form which changes to jusu when preceded by a vowel.
Note that third person plural subject on kusu is also phonetically non‐salient, since the
element =w is not audible on a stem ending in /u/.
13 Even though Day printed her material in 1980, she has been working with the Yurakarés since
the 1950s. The fact that for the most part, she worked in other areas than I did may have
something to do with this too.

There can be maximally three arguments encoded on the verb. One of these is always
the subject (with possibly the exception of a few experiencer verbs, as discussed
above), the other two can differ. Direct object can be combined with the cooperative
object, indirect object and affected object:

"796The noun phraseIn (17)b, the fact that the numeral lëtta is marked with the collective suffix, indicates
that this quantity refers to the whole plurality of bananas, yielding the interpretation of
a bunch of bananas.
The marker ‐ibe/‐ybe on modifiers indicates that we are dealing with more than one
collective. It tells us that the quantity expressed by the root does not concern the
smallest units, but rather a larger grouping of these units:
(18) ablëshie palanta=w
two
banana=PL
‘two bananas/two bunches of bananas’
lëshie‐ybe
palanta=w
two‐COL.PL banana=PL
‘two bunches of bananas /*two bananas’In addition to the marker ‐ibe/‐ybe, the modifier can be marked with a distributive
suffix, dividing the quality expressed by it over the different collectives:
(19) bëmë
ti‐palanta=w
matat‐ibe‐wma=w
much;many
1SG‐banana
big‐COL.PL‐DST=PL
‘I have many big bunches of bananas’ [AA‐9MA‐6]Collective and distributive marking, being derivational elements, are optional. In (19)
for instance, the quantifier bëmë is not marked for collective where it might have been.
Everything can be left unspecified:
(20) lëshie palanta matata=w
two
banana big=PL
‘two big bananas/banana trees/bunches of bananas’Furthermore, the presence of the collective marker is restricted by the meaning of the
modifier and of the head noun. Collective markers can in principle appear on any
adjective, but they most often appear on adjectives of dimension (cf. section 4.5.1
below). As for the head noun they modify, some entities con only be considered
separate entities when plural. Elements modifying animate nouns, for instance, are
normally not marked for collective. There is one exception: the adjective atta ‘other’:
(21) att‐ima
jente=w
other‐COL
people=PL
‘other (kind of) people’With atta, the whole group is considered to be ‘the others’, while with other modifiers,
e.g. matata ‘big’, can apparently not refer to group size when talking about animate
objects:97A grammar of Yurakaré(22) * matat‐ima
shunñe=w
big‐COL
man=PL
‘a big group of men/a large kind of men.’Dependent elements modifying class B NPs can often still be marked for collective or
distributive:

sibbë matat‐uma
much/many

‘many big houses’
bëmë

lëtt‐ima
kabu
one‐COL
soap
‘one package of soap (containing several pieces)’ [MH‐26MA‐8]
lëtt‐ima
biskotcho
one‐COL
bread
‘one bag of bread (containing several pieces)’ [MH‐26MA‐8]Apart from the absence of the number marker =w, the nouns in (23) and (24) fully
behave as count nouns. The suffix ‐uma on a modifier divides the quality or quantity
over several, discrete entities, while ‐ima forces the interpretation of a collection of
entities.
Not all nouns that are in this class behave like this, however. Collective marking on a
modifier of a noun denoting a substance triggers the interpretation of a bounded body
of mass, deriving bounded, countable entities from conceptually unbounded
substances:
(25) ablëtt‐ima
asuja
one‐COL
sugar
‘one bag of sugar’ [VP‐6MA‐2]
liwi‐be
samma
three‐COL.PL water
‘three lakes’ [FL‐1MA‐22]Furthermore, there are class B nouns whose modifiers cannot take the collective
marker, and there are yet other class B nouns whose modifiers almost always take the
collective marker, without any clear semantic effect:98The noun phrase(26) ab*lëtt‐ima sibbë
one‐COL house
‘a collection of houses’ [AA‐12MA‐1]
lëtt‐ima
ëshshë
one‐COL
stone
‘one stone’ [FL‐3MA‐4]The fact that not all class B‐noun modifiers can take the collective marker may be due
to semantic reasons. It seems that the collective marker can only be present if there is
genuine structural integration of the subparts of an entity, i.e. when they are physically
connected 8. With highly individuated entities, like sibbë ‘house’, but also the animate
nouns of class A, it is harder to construe a collective interpretation. Nouns of the type
ëshshë ‘stone’ seem to form a genuinely different class that also behaves differently with
respect to verb agreement, as we will see below.
Modifiers of class C nouns generally carry the collective marker:
(27) ablëtt‐ima
ti‐ewte=w

1SG‐broom=PL
‘I have one broom’ [MH‐14MA‐8]
matat‐ima
ti‐tupta=w

‘I have a large mosquito net.’ [FP‐2MA‐10]In fact, the distinction between the two types of class B nouns (e.g. sibbë ‘house’ vs.
ëshshë ‘stone’) is parallel to the distinction between class A and class C nouns, yielding
a four‐way class distinction:
Table 20 ‐ Four nominal classes based on plural marking and collective marking
non‐inherently singularinherently singularnon‐inherently collectiveshunñe ‘man’sibbë ‘house’inherently collectiveewete ‘broom’ëshshë ‘stone’This classification replaces the classification given in Table 19 above, and I will refer to
them in the remainder of this grammar as class I (type shunñe), class II (type ewete),
class III (type sibbë), and class IV (type ëshshë).
These four classes also have repercussions for object agreement marking on the verb.
Object agreement markers are prefixed to the verb root. Class I objects are cross‐
referenced by means of ø‐ (singular) 9 or ma‐ (plural):An exception is example (21), where the connection is symbolic rather than physical.
I do not consider a zero element to be present, but for the sake of clarity I will indicate lack of
marking here with the symbol ‘ø’.","[111, 112, 113, 114]"
"2.4.7 Discourse‐based stress
Stress can be used for pragmatic purposes. This is especially important for deictic
words. I have found differences such as the following:
(75) unmarked
latíjsha
achúta
anúta
achàmatíjsha~ marked
~ látijsha
~ áchu(ta)
~ ánu(ta)
~ àchamátijshagloss
‘after that’
‘in that way’
‘in this way’
‘in spite of that’These stress differences are caused by pragmatic highlighting, just as in English
you can say: ‘after THAT’ and ‘AFter that’.
Stress as a pragmatic device is not grammaticalized, i.e. obligatory, but it may
very well be that the heavy prefix‐rule (cf .2.4.2) was originally a pragmatically
driven stress rule
Sentence intonation can also marginally influence stress‐placement. Medial
clauses form an intonational phrase, and they are characterized by a higher pitch
at the penultimate syllable, which is maintained at the final syllable. Higher pitch
often coincides with stress in Yurakaré. This can override all other prosodic
constraints:45A grammar of Yurakaré(76) absetá‐ø=w=ya

‘When he came out, he spoke with him.’ (FA‐6MA‐5)Lëjëlë is a word with a diacritically marked first syllable, and so the expected stress
pattern would be lë$jëlë@shtati. This is overruled by intonational pitch and stress,
which can cause stress to fall on the penultimate syllable of the intonation phrase.
In the case of ottoja, the first syllable is heavy and so we would expect the stress
pattern to be óttoja. But, again, this is overruled by intonational stress.
In some cases, intonational stress can fall on the last syllable of the intonation
phrase.

"97A grammar of Yurakaréthe Macro‐Quechuan network, including inter alia nearby languages such as
Quechua, Itonama, Mosetén, and Cayuvava. Greenberg (1960, 1987) and Key
(1979) classify Yurakaré as an equatorial language, in the Andean‐Equatorial
stock, along with, among others, Cayuvava, Arawak, and Tupi languages. Suárez
(1974) links Yurakaré to Mosetén (something which had been suggested by
Metraux in a personal comment to Mason 1950:275) and Chon languages, as well
as to Pano‐Tacanan in a stock he calls Macro‐Pano‐Tacanan.
All authors that have considered Yurakaré in their classification base their
proposals on La Cueva (1893), which is a rich source, but not rich enough to justify
these classifications (cf. Suárez 1974:137‐138). Secondly, the correspondences they
find are not overwhelming, as confirmed by Campbell (1997:192) and Adelaar
with Muysken (2004:27‐29). Using a word list with 133 items, Greenberg (1987)
only finds 22 correlates for Yurakaré, some of which are rather far off from their
cognate examples both formally and notionally. The highest number of lexical
correlations that Suárez (1974) finds for Yurakaré is with Tacana (14 out of 100 ‐ cf.
Suárez 1974:138). He also finds some systematic correspondences in the
pronominal system, some grammatical categories and phonology, but these are
sometimes due to errors in La Cueva’s grammar (e.g. causative ma‐, focus marker ‐
ya, negator chama).
In the light of these controversies, it is best to regard Yurakaré as an unclassified
language, for which convincing evidence has not (yet) been found to classify it
with (an)other language(s) in a larger group. Hopefully this grammar will
contribute to shed some more light on this issue.","[22, 23]"
"327A grammar of Yurakaré8.2.7 Overview: types of clause combinations and their encoding
In the previous sections, I have taken as a point of departure the morphosyntactic
encoding of clause combinations, structuring the text along these lines. The
disadvantage of this approach is that typological categories of types of clause
combinations are scattered over the different sections. Therefore I end the chapter
with a short schematic overview of clause combinations in Yurakaré which takes
as a point of departure the different types of clause combinations:

three) clauses, and with an asterisk I indicate which morphosyntactic devices are
used to encode these types of clauses. Between brackets I have put some
additional information, like (+pp), (+dem) or (+int) which indicates that in addition
to the encoding strategy indicated in the top row, this type of clause needs a
postposition, a demonstrative pronoun or a special intonation pattern. The symbol
‘±’ indicates that the addition of an element is not required in all instances.
As for the columns, they refer to the morphosyntactic encoding devices used.
Since this is the point of departure taken in this chapter, they directly refer to
sections. The verb phrase conjunctions (VPC) are discussed in section 8.2.1, ya‐
clauses in section 8.2.2, ja‐clauses in 8.2.3, ti‐clauses in 8.2.4; the symbol ‘ø’ means
balanced clauses without morphological marking, which were discussed in section
8.2.5, and finally, the remaining ‘other strategies’ were discussed in section 8.2.6.
The switch reference system can be schematically represented as follows:328The clauseTable 54 - The switch-reference system of Yurakaré

irrealis mode (i.e. future, intentional, desiderative, habitual, imperative, jussive,
etc.). The enclitic =ja is used to mark realis events that have the same subject as the
main predicate, as well as certain irrealis events with different subjects, i.e. when
the main clause can be interpreted as a directive, the subject of the subordinate
clause is a first person, and the subject of the main clause is a second person. The
different subject marker =ti, finally, is used for both realis and irrealis events that
have a different subject from the main predicate, with the exception of the first
person directives just outlined. When a subordinate event needs to be specified by
means of a postposition, both same and different subject is marked with =ti.","[342, 343, 344]"
