11.1 The status of subjects and topics in Lango syntax
As the leftmost NP in unmarked sentences, the subject usually plays the role
of topic in Lango. But the subject and topic roles are more easily separable in
Lango than in English, since any argument of the predicate or associative NP
in the matrix clause or parallel clauses (Sec. 11.2) can easily assume the topic
role by being moved to sentence-initial position, and, somewhat less acceptably, so can arguments in subordinate predications.
We have already discussed (Sec. 8.5.2) how topics in Lango differ from
those in 'topic-prominent' languages such as Mandarin: In Mandarin,
topics need not be arguments or associatives, whereas in Lango they must
be. However, topics in Lango and Mandarin share a number of characteristics, which we will briefly summarize here. First, they must be interpreted as definite or generic, at least when distinct from the subject
(Noonan 1977). Second, they are interpreted as the sentence orientation,
delimiting the frame within which the rest of the sentence is interpreted;
in more traditional terms, they are what the sentence is about. And third,
they occupy leftmost position in the sentence. This latter characteristic
has an exception in Lango, namely clefted NP's, which can precede a topicsubject, though must follow topicalized NP's.
The function of the subject divorced from its usual role as topic is as
the highest grammatical slot in a role identification system which matches
highest grammatical slot to highest available semantic role.
In Lango,
the role hierarchy has agent as the highest role, experiencer next, followed by patient, locative, instrument, etc. Instrument subjects scarcely
exist in Lango.
In this section we will examine a number of properties of topics and
subjects and provide some suggestions as to why each set is associated
with the NP it is. 145Topic propertiesThe topic is the only NP whose definiteness is assured simply because of
the grammatical slot it occupies. Out of context, of the arguments in (1),
( 1 ) loc» däkö ömiö bukman woman 3s-give-perf book
'the man was given a book by the woman'
only the topic must receive a definite interpretation. Subjects must receive
a definite interpretation only when they are also topics. This guaranteeThe status of subjects and objects in Lango syntax259of definiteness, setting topics apart from other arguments in the sentence,
was referred to as the 'referential prominence' of the topic by Schachter
(1977). It is this referential prominence of the topic that results in the interpretation of the topic as the sentence orientation, since as the only bit
of necessarily definite, backgrounded or presupposed information, it is
the focal point of linkage of the sentence with previous discourse and background information. As such, it provides the frame within which the sentence is interpreted.
It is interesting to note that all languages seem to provide a mechanism
(apart from the simple use of demonstratives) to definitize at least one
noun per sentence. When languages lack a system of articles, topic
markers, or other indicators of presupposed status, initial position seems
to fill this function. 146 This is true for languages as diverse as Russian,
Mandarin, and Lango. The syntax and pragmatics of initial position topics
show remarkable similarities in all these languages.
The essence of the syntactic properties of the topic is coreferentially
with other topics. The topic is the link binding the sentence to other sentences in discourse, whereas the subject plays a role wholly internal to the
sentence. So, it is the topic, not the subject, that controls coreference with
adjacent and subordinate clauses:
(1) d k Iocs όηέηό. c mmo dckwoman man 3s-see-perf. 3s-eat-prog stew
'the woman was seen by the man. She was eating stew'
(2) dakloca όηέηό. Ιέ d kwoman man 3s-see-perf. 3s-and+then-hab
go+back-infin
'the woman was seen by the man, and then she went
back'
(3) dak loca όηέηό ante a mattό k5rpwoman man 3s-see-perf rel-part 3s-drink-prog beer
'the woman was seen by the man while she was
drinking beer'
Notice that if dak were not topicalized and the subject loca were the
topic, loc» would be interpreted as the subject of the second clause in
(1-3). As shown in Sec. 9.10, the topic also controls coreference with
switch/non-switch reference morphology. This control of coreference
is a predictable consequence of assuming the sentence orientation,
which provides the linkage not only with previous, but also with subsequent, discourse.
In Sec. 9.10, it was also noted that topics control coreference with
floated quantifiers. This is also a consequence of assuming the sentence
orientation, as pointed out by Schachter (1977) for Tagalog. The NP quantified by a form like all has the property of being necessarily referential
(definite) or generic in interpretation. Sentence orientations like topics are260Additional isstiesalways definite or generic, but in Lango an unqualified noun that is not
the sentence orientation may receive either a definite or indefinite interpretation. If a quantifier were allowed to float away from any position other
than the sentence orientation, the noun would no longer obligatorily
receive a definite interpretation and hence a conflict could arise between
this interpretation and the obligatory definite interpretation associated
with quantified nouns. In the case of floating from a topicalized NP or a
subject NP in the absence of a topicalized NP, no such conflict arises.
Subject propertiesLango is an indirect role marking language and the subject is the highest
ranking argument slot (Noonan 1977). This means that the subject must
be an argument of the verb — unlike the topic, which need have no special relationship to the verb, but must have some recoverable relation to
the predication that follows so that the predication can be about the topic.
Further, the subject in Lango is an indispensable constituent; not only is
the matrix verb always inflected for subject, but subjects are almost always
referential — i.e. there are no 'dummy' subjects in Lango
and few impersonal constructions. Recall that even weather expressions (Sec. 8.13)
are not impersonal in Lango. Only predicates with extraposed sentential
subjects are impersonal and of these only modal expressions are idiomatic
(Sec. 9.1.1).
Where the topic provides the link with discourse and so controls
coreference across sentence boundaries, the subject controls coreference
within the sentence. This is because the subject is an integral part of the
predication, its semantic role determined by the valence scheme of the
verb, and so on, whereas the topic may originate outside the valence set,
i.e. from an associative construction or from a subordinate clause. So the
subject, not the topic, controls coreference with reflexives. Compare the
following sentences:
(1) okelo okwao äläbä pire keneO. 3s-ask-perf A. about-3s self-3sa
Okeloi asked Alaba about himself;'
(2) äläbä okelö okwao pire kensA. O. 3s-ask-pcrf about-3s self-3sa
'Alaba was asked by Okelo; about himself;'
In both (1) and (2), the reflexive pronoun can only refer to Okelo, the
subject. If Alaba is the intended object of pi, the reflexive cannot be used:
(3) okelo okwao äläbä pireO. 3s-ask-perf A. about-3s
Okelo asked Alaba; about himself;'The status of subjects and objects in Lango syntax261The intended referent of pire in (3) could, of course, be someone other
than Alaba, but could not be Okelo.
The subject is also interpreted as coreferential with the subjects of
verbs in all following verb phrases where there is no intervening S-boundary. This includes the second clause in serial constructions (n.b. not
paratactic constructions — see Sec. 9.1.3 and 11.2) and infinitives, whether
complements or adjuncts:
serial
( 1 ) ogwarj okelo owoto ojwato
O. O. 3s-go-perf 3s-hit-perf
Ogwang was hit by Okelo'
complement
(2) ogwai) okelo amitto jwatteO. O. 3s-want-prog hit-infin-3s
Ogwang, Okelo wants to hit him'
adjunct
(3)ogwag okelo ojwato me yommo yx äläbäO. O. 3s-hit-perf for soften-infin stomach A.
Ogwang was hit by Okelo in order to please Alaba'
Okelo, the subject, and not Ogwang, the topic, is interpreted as the subject of the second verb in the series in (1) and the infinitives in (2) and (3).
Viewed from a traditional transformational perspective, Lango has
remarkably few subject creating processes. As noted in Sec. 8.6, there is
no passive in Lango. As argued in 1.2.1, the Tr/SA distinction cannot be
viewed as an active/passive contrast, nor can the active/middle distinction
(Sec. 8.2.2): Both lack the sense of the passive. Topicalization comes closest
to the sense, but does not result in the assumption of subject status by a
topicalized object.
Similarly, raising phenomena are notably absent.
There are no
Lango equivalents to the English 'Floyd seems to like whiskey' and 'Roscoe is likely to be inebriated'. There is, in any case, a general disinclination to express judgements impersonally in Lango: The two sentences
mentioned above would normally be expressed in Lango with expressions
like know/believe/think that Floyd . . . ' or the like.
In terms of the typology presented by Li and Thompson (1976), Lango
is a subject prominent language. Reference to subjects on the verb is
obligatory, and impersonal constructions are rare. But because it is poor
in grammatical operations that refer solely to subjects, it can only be considered weakly subject dominant. The topic plays a prominent role in
Lango syntax, and grammatical processes like relativization, interrogation, and the like operate on objects as freely as subjects.","[273, 274, 275, 276, 277]"
"PART THREE:
SYNTAX8. The syntax of simple sentences
8.1 Basic order of the sentence
Lango is an indirect role marking language (Noonan 1977), which is to
say it uses grammatical roles such as subject (Su) and direct object (DO)
as part of its strategy for indicating semantic roles, such as agent and
patient. Nouns are not marked for case, nor are there particles (ä la
Japanese, Korean, Persian) to indicate Su or DO roles. Word order, which
is fairly rigid, is the primary device used to indicate grammatical roles in
simple sentences. To the extent that word order permits, the order topic
first, comment last is also fairly rigidly adhered to. The unmarked order
of elements is:
(topic) (Su) verb (benefactive) (DO) (prepositional phrases) (adverbials)
The topic slot may be filled by a noun playing any grammatical role in the
sentence (including associative NP's and NP's from subordinate clauses —
Sections 8.5.2 and 9.9.1). In the unmarked case, the subject is also the
topic.
The subject is an obligatory component of the Lango sentence: Lango
has no impersonal constructions. However, it is reference to a subject that
is obligatory, not an overt subject NP, and an overt subject NP need not
be present:
(1)a. an äcämo dek
I ls-eat-perf stew
ate stew'
b. äcämo dek
ls-eat-perf stew
ate stew'(2)a. loca öcämo dek
man 3s-eat-perf stew
'the man ate stew'
b. öcämo dek
3s-eat-perf stew
'he ate stew'Benefactives [and antibenefactives] (ben) immediately follow the verb,
which takes the benefactive stem (Sec. 8.2.3):
(1)a. anadbk
I ls-go+back-perf
went back'120The syntax of simple sentencesb.","[132, 133, 134, 135, 136]"
"The organization of the noun phrase1618.7.4 Use of determiners
As noted above in the discussion on topicalization, a noun is normally not
marked as definite or indefinite. Its definiteness is a matter of interpretation, but the first noun in a sentence (either the subject or topicalized NP)
is necessarily definite (but see below). The likelihood of a definite interpretation decreases toward the end of the sentence.
The grammar, however, provides a few ways to insure a definite interpretation. Any noun marked with a demonstrative will be given a
definite interpretation. There are three demonstratives, listed below, each
with a different deictic interpretation:
SgPI-ni
-no
-ca/ka-gi
-go
-ica'this/these'
'that/those'
'that/those over there, yonder'The morphology of these forms is discussed in Sec. 5.2.6.; their syntax was
discussed in Sec. 8.7.1. Impressionistically, they are used rather more frequently than their counterparts in English, perhaps because of their function as definitizers.
In addition to the demonstratives, Lango also employs a thematic
affix. This affix, whose form is -mere, can be attached to a noun
reintroduced from previous discourse (Sec. 10.1) or otherwise known
to the discussants, but not in the forefront of consciousness of the
hearer. It could in some cases be translated by 'the aforementioned',
'the . . . we know'. Nouns marked in this way are topics and occupy initial, topic position. Proper nouns may be marked with -mere. Any noun
marked with this suffix will, of course, receive a definite interpretation.
The use of -mere is not obligatory for such topics and tends to be used
in dialogs rather than extended narratives. Time expressions frequently use -mere:
(1)τ dikkomere gin ducu obi no rwattein morning-theme they all 3p-come-perf meet-mid-infin
'in the morning, they all came to meet each other'
A noun can receive an indefinite, and frequently non-specific, interpretation with the suffix -moro, pi. -moga:
(1)nattSro
person-indef
'someone, somebody'(2)gwok'koro
dog-indef
'some dog, a dog'162The syntax of simple sentences(3)gwoggi'marä \
gwoggi'mogS J
dogs-indef
'some dogs, dogs'-moro may be used in place of -mogS with plural nouns. The only way a
subject can receive an indefinite interpretation is if it is marked with
-moro:
(4)twollord ökäö ätin
snake-indef 3s-bite-perf child
'a snake bit the child'The indefinite marker is almost always found with subjects in existential
constructions:
(5)puno'morS tie i qe it
pig-indef 3s-be+present-hab in back house
'there's a pig behind the house'Not all indefinites are marked with -maro; in fact, the majority are not.
Except for its use with generic nouns, such as gat 'person', gin 'thing', which
when -maro is suffixed onto them form the Lango equivalent of English indefinite pronouns (cf (1) above), -maro is almost always found in subject
position. The reason for this is that the Lango sentence is organized roughly on an old-new continuum. Subjects are always interpreted as definite
unless specifically made indefinite with -more (hence the association with
subjects in existential constructions). In other sentence positions, NP's are
assigned definite or indefinite interpretations pragmatically, and do not
require an explicit indefinitizer like subjects.
See Sec. 9.11 for the expression of negative indefinite senses.
8.7.5 Conjunction of NP's and adjectives
There is no true symmetric conjunction of NP's in Lango. Instead, assymetric coordination with prepositions is used. The usual preposition is
kede 'with' (rarely ke) whose other uses include expression of instrument:
(1)okelo kede ojuk ocamo dek
O. with O. 3s-eat-perf stew
Okelo and Ojuk ate the stew'The verb is conjugated for third person singular, agreeing with the true
subject Okelo rather than the plural sense. When a first person singular
reference is included among the conjuncts, it is usual to use the first
person plural pronoun as the head, in a sense summing up the totality
of the conjunction:The organization of the noun phrase(2)163wan kedi oca mo dek
we with-2s 1 p-eat-perf stew
'you and I ate the stew'The verb in such cases takes first person plural concord. Notice that kede
like other prepositions, is conjugated for person. The object of kede may
be topicalized (or relativized on — Sec. 9.2):
(3)yfn wan kedi ocamo dek
you we with-2s 1 p-eat-perf stew
'you and I ate the stew'When more than two NP's are coordinated, kede need not be repeated
before each conjunct, only before the last, though such repetition is more
frequent than the analogous repetition of and in English:
(4)wan okelo kede l b ocamo dek
we O. with A. 1 p-eat-perf stew
Okelo, Alaba, and I ate the stew'Note the ambiguity of the following:
(5)okelo omato c y kede c k
O. 3s-drink-perf tea with milk
Okelo drank tea with milk' or
Okelo drank tea and milk'Another preposition in this class is ginni 'with'. A peculiarity of this
form is that the NP's linked with it cannot be pronouns, but must be nouns:
(6)apwo ginni kwac nwoijo obedo owote
H. with L. 3s-find-perf 3s-stay-perf friends
'Hare and Leopard were friends'kede, ke, and ginni can all be used to express accompaniment; ginni cannot be used for instruments. See Sec. 8.11.3 for the relation between NP
conjunction and accompaniment.
Disjunction is accomplished with όρο, which is the third person singular
perfective of poo 'to be possible', όρο is frequently used as a parenthetical
meaning 'maybe, perhaps', and this use seems to underlie its role in disjunction:
(1)d koopoobino
woman 3s-be+possible-perf 3s-come perf
'maybe the woman came'(2)d k ορό loca obin
woman 3s-be+possible-perf man 3s-come-perf
'either the woman or the man came'(3)an όρο yin abino
I 3s-be + possible-perf you ls-come-perf
'either you or I came'164The syntax of simple sentencesExample (3) shows that the noun before όρο is the grammatical subject,
determining subject agreement. Neither disjunct can be felicitously
topicalized.
The interpretation of the disjunction with ορό, which can occur in all
sentential positions,
(4)tin oc mo rec όρο riijo
child 3s-eat-perf fish 3s-be-t-possible-perf meat
'the child ate fish or meat'is that one or the other, but not both holds. So in (4), the child ate either
fish or meat, but not both. Despite its origin as a verb and its additional
meaning of'maybe, perhaps', όρο is a true conjunction, as examples like
(4) clearly show. If όρο were not a conjunction, one might expect (4) to
assert that fish had been eaten, and to leave open the additional possibility
of meat as well. As it is, the interpretation of rec is within the disjunction
created by ορό.
In comparing όρο with kede, όρο creates true symmetric coordinate
structures whereas kede (and ginnf) does not. Compare, for example, their
behavior vis- -vis topicalization noted above. Constructions with όρο obey
Ross' (1967) Coordinate Structure Constraint, where those with kede do
not (see also Sec. 9.6).
There is no Lango equivalent of
(1)Okelo, but not Opio, cameentS 'but' can only be used to coordinate full sentences. (1) would have to
be translated as (2):
(2)okelo obino Ento όρίό pe obinoO. 3s-come-perf but O. neg 3s-come-perf
Okelo came, but Opio didn't come'
Adjectives are coordinated by simple juxtaposition, both in their
predicatival and attributive functions:
(1)yin itek iryekyou 2s-strong-hab 2s-wise-hab
'you are strong and wise'
(2)ageo loca tek a ryek
ls-know-hab man att+part strong att+part wise
Ί know a strong and wise man'Disjunction is accomplished with όρο:
(3)yin itek όρο iryek
you 2s-strong-hab 3s-be + possible-perf 2s-wise-hab
'you are strong or wise'The organization of the noun phrase
(4)arjeo loca165tek όρο a ryekls-know-hab man att+part strong 3s-be+possible-perf
att+part wise
Ί know the man who is strong or wise'
8.7.6 PronominaleIndependent personal pronouns basically occur only as subjects and topicalized NP's; in other positions, personal pronouns appear as suffixes on
verbs, prepositions, or nouns (when associatives):
(1)an akvpo bur
I ls-dig-perf hole
Ί dug a hole'(subject)(2)an loca onena
(topic)
I man 3s-see-perf-ls
Ί was seen by the man'However, independent pronouns may occasionally occur in other positions
in addition to the suffixed pronouns when indicating emphatic contrast,
(3)loca oncna anman 3s-see-perf-ls I
'the man saw me!'
though the cleft construction is more usual in this function (see Sec. 10.1).
Independent subject pronouns are, like other subject NP's, not obligatory,
the inflection on the verb clearly marking person and number:
(4)kijrji burls-dig-perf hole
Ί dug a hole'
They are always present when some contrast is intended or when there
is a change of topic. First or second person pronouns are used frequently
in other contexts as well and are much more frequent than, say, their
Spanish counterparts, even though the Lango verb is equally well
inflected for subject.
Demonstrative pronouns, together with their use as true pronominals,
(1)man odoko a tek okkothis 3s-become-perf att+part hard completely
'this has become hard'
may also substitute for the demonstrative affixes:
(2)a. okelo okwano bukkiO. 3s-read-perf book-this
Okelo read this book'166The syntax of simple sentencesb. okelo ökwänö buk man
O. 3s-read-perf book this
Okelo read this book'
Indefinite pronouns do not, per se, exist in Lango. In their place,
generic nouns are used:
(1)aneno rjat
1 s-see-perf person
saw someone'Negative indefinites are discussed in Sec. 9.11.
The reflexive pronoun is ken- to which inalienable associative affixes are
added. This is optionally used together with middle voice morphology when
the subject is interpreted as coreferential with the notional direct object:
(1)onekere
3s-kill-mid-perf
'he killed himself(2)onekere kene
3s-kill-mid-perf self-3sa
'he killed himself(3)onekere kengi
3p-kill-mid-perf self-Spa
'they killed themselves'Its use is obligatory, however, when the subject is coreferential with the
object of a preposition or benefactive. In such cases, both the preposition
(or verb) and ken- are inflected for person and number:
(4)öbote olego obarja pire kene
O. 3s-pray-perf God because+of-3s self-3sa
Obote prayed to God about himself(5)äläbä öwille kene buk
A. 3s-buy-ben-perf-3s self-3sa book
'Alaba bought herself a book'When not associated with the middle voice, an inflected preposition, or
the benefactive, k«n- means 'alone':
(6)äbinö kena
1 s-come-perf self-1 sa
came alone'8.7.7 Expression of number; number concord
Many Lango nouns, particularly those referring to humans and animals,
have distinctive plural forms. There is no regular plural formation inThe organization of the noun phrase167Lango, so each singular/plural pair must be individually lexicalized:
(1)a. däkowomanmonwomenb. äwobiawobeboyboysc. dyägdokcowcowsd. gwökdogdogse. buk
bookbuke
booksf. gwenogwenchicken
g. ägäkcrowchickens
ägakancrowsRecently borrowed nouns tend to form their plurals with the suffix -e. See
Sec. 5.2.5 for a discussion of the formation of plural nouns.
A large number of nouns do not have distinctive plural forms. Most
nouns referring to body parts, implements, location, fruits, trees and
vegetables are in this class. These nouns can still be quantified, however:
(1 )gulu äcel
pot one
One pot'(2)gulu aryo
pot two
'two pots'(3)gulu a nokpot att+part few
'few pots'
(4)gulu a polpot att+part many
'many pots'
Even when a noun has a distinctive plural, as subject it takes third person singular concord. The third plural forms are used only with zero subject and with the pronoun gin 'they':
(1)otoo3p-die-perf
'they died'168The syntax of simple sentences
(2)gin ötoöthey 3p-die-perf
'they died'
(3)gwok otoo
dog 3s-die-perf
'the dog died'(4)gwoggi oto5dogs 3s-die-perf
'the dogs died'
(5)gulu otoo
pot 3s-die-perf
'the pot/pots broke'(6)gulu ädek otbäpot three 3s-die-perf
'three pots broke'
However, adjectives, whether predicate or attributive, agree with the sense
of the noun:
(1)gulu racpot 3s-bad-hab
'the pot is no good'
(2)gulu recupots 3s-bad-pl-hab
'the pots are no good'
With a topicalized subject, the pronoun, not the noun, determines the form
of the verb:
(3)rwodi gin ömäro k5tpkings they 3p-like-hab beer
'kings, they like beer'
Even when nouns have distinctive plurals, they are not always used.
For example, one hears
(1)gwökkäpoldog att+part many
'many dogs'
alongside the expected:
(2)gwoggi a poldogs att+part many
'many dogs'The organization of the noun phrase1698.7.8 Floated quantifiers
The quantifier ducu 'all, both', when modifying a subject of an intransitive verb, can be placed immediately after the verb instead of its usual
position within the NP:
(1)awobe ducu odok pi rwot
boys all 3s-go+back-perf because+of king
'all the boys went back because of the king'(2)awobe odok ducu pi rwot
boys 3s-go+back-perf all because+of king
'the boys all went back because of the king'The quantifier in (2) is a 'floated' quantifier.
Another unique property of ducu is its ability to be 'stranded' by
relativization, cleft, and topicalization:
(3)a. d k o l kede xtin ducu
woman 3s-be+tired-hab with children all
'the woman is tired of all the children'
b. itin dak o l kedgi ducu
children woman 3s-be+tired-hab with-3p all
'the children, the woman is tired of them all'(4)a. rwot οηέηό gwoggi ducu
king 3s-see-perf dogs all
'the king saw all the dogs'
b. gwoggi rwot όηέηό ducudogs king 3s-see-perf all
'the dogs were all seen by the king'
Other modifiers may not be stranded, ducu may, of course, be part of the
topic NP:
c. gwoggi ducu rwot όηέηόdogs all king 3s-see-perf
'all the dogs were seen by the king'
When ducu is floated, as in (2), or stranded, as in (4b), it is always because it and not its head is within the scope of assertion. For instance, (1)
would be an appropriate answer to (5), where w be ducu is topical information in both sentences:
(5)awobe ducu odok pirjo?
boys all 3s-go+back-perf why
'why did all the boys go back?'","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185]"
"262Additional issues11.2 The grammatical status of parataxis and serialization
The paratactic construction represents something of a hybrid. On the one
hand, it has characteristic features of non-coordinate constructions:
Phonologically, it behaves as a simple sentence. Syntactically, there are
constraints on the second clause (no overt subject NP, the subject must be
interpreted as an argument of the first clause) which are reminiscent of
truncated embedded predications, frequently represented by infinitive
phrases or the like. And semantically, the paratactic construction can
sometimes be translated by simplex constructions in English or sentences
containing complement clauses. But on the other hand, there is the two
assertion aspect of parataxis and a range of interpretations that is similar
to clauses conjoined by 'and' in English.
So the paratactic construction seems to partake of both coordinate and
non-coordinate status. Clearly, the second clause is not straightforwardly
grammatically subordinate to the first: There can be no subordinator like
the complementizer ni, the verb does not assume a special form like the
subjunctive or infinitive, nor can the switch/non-switch reference opposition be exploited as with hypotactic indicative complements. Subordinate
status would, in any case, be difficult to reconcile with the two assertion
semantics of parataxis. And just as clearly, parataxis differs from true coordination in Lango. The Coordinate Structure Constraint controls cleft and
relativization in true coordinate structures, but does not apply to paratactic constructions since NP's in the first clause may be clefted or relativized
on. Since the second clause in a paratactic construction seems neither to
be clearly subordinate nor clearly coordinate with the first, a new sort of
relationship can informally be proposed, namely that of 'parallel' structures. Parallel structures have the same grammatical rank, but are not coordinate since there are syntactic constraints governing form and
interpretation of parallel structures, as opposed to the pragmatic constraints that govern the form and interpretation of true coordinate structures.150 They share with structures involving subordination syntactic
constraints on one clause (the second in parallel structure) but differ from
subordination in that the affected clause will not show any overt signs of
subordination. The fact that the second clause is of equal rank with the first
means that its verb will necessarily be fully inflected as a main verb and,
in the case of parataxis, that the interpretation of the second clause will be
unaffected by the first. Both of these characteristics serve to differentiate
01
parallel structures from main-subordinate relationships. 1^1
Parallel structures are fundamentally hybrids, partaking of aspects of
both subordination and coordination. Syntactically, there is some resemblance to main-subordinate relationships, but semantically they are
more like coordinate structures in that their meaning is horizontally rather
than vertically organized. That is, it is arranged in a linear sequence of bits
with relations between the bits left mostly to inference rather than organizedGrammatical status of parataxis and serialization263around a main clause which acts as a sort of semantic pivot and filter.15""
1 ^^
Main-subordinate relationships are characterized by the latter.
Verbs in serial constructions are also parallel, but as pointed out in
Sec. 9.1.4, and elsewhere, serial and paratactic constructions have
numerous differences. Serials seem most compatible with an interpretation as parallel verb phrases.
This would naturally account for the
obligatory aspect and subject agreement, the possibility of only one negative per sentence, etc. Paratactic constructions are more compatible with
an interpretation as parallel clauses, which would account for the possibility of each clause having different aspect and different subjects, for
the possibility for separately negating each clause, etc. This analysis would
also be compatible with the interpretation of paratactic constructions as
constituting two assertions.
Having examined the differences between parataxis and serialization
in Lango and, presumably, elsewhere, we can now speculate on a possible
diachronic relation between the two. I would like to suggest parataxis as
a possible source for serialization.
Serial constructions could develop
by reanalysis of paratactic constructions, especially where the syntactic constraints on serialization match, or nearly match, the pragmatic requirements of certain constructions.
In the case of the comparative and ingressive, we find a match of this
sort. In these constructions, the subject of both clauses will necessarily be
the same, as will the aspect marking on both predicates. Independent negation, hardly possible given the sense of the ingressive, is not likely with
the comparative. And the semantic effect of one versus two assertions is
minimal in these cases. Reanalysis as serial constructions would just syntacticize the pragmatic status quo. The only obvious syntactic consequence
would be the placement of the negative — from
(1) adworj pe äl5 rwot
ls-fat-hab neg ls-defeat-hab king
'I'm fatter than the king*
when the construction is paratactic, to
(2) pe adwOQ alo rwöt
neg ls-fat-hab ls-defeat-hab king
'I'm fatter than the king'
following reanalysis.
In other cases, the syntactic requirements of serialization will be met,
if not as consistently, at least regularly. For instance,
(3)mac omio oboke otwofire 3s-give-perf leaf 3s-dry-perf
the fire gave it to the leaf (=did something to the leaf),
it dried
'the fire dried the leaf264Additional issuesa causative paratactic construction, 6 meets the syntactic specifications
for a serial as would quite likely the majority of instances of causative
parataxis. Reanalysis would leave the overall semantic complexity of these
sentences virtually unchanged, so that (3) as a serial could carry basically
the same information as before. Such constructions are potential candidates for reanalysis. Structurally, the jump from parallel clauses to parallel verb phrases is not very great, particularly when the full potential of
the second clause, e.g. its ability to freely select a subject, is already limited
by the constraints on parataxis.
Reanalysis from paratactic to serial will most likely occur where one
of the verbs assumes a regular role in a construction so that it can be given
a sentence functional interpretation. By this, I mean direct object marker,
indirect object marker, marker of comparative, marker of aspect, etc. In
Lango, ID- 'exceed' (and its synonym kat-) have assumed the role of marker
of comparative, and wot- 'go', when followed by another perfective verb,
serves to reinforce perfective aspect, though it retains a motional sense
as well. Its omission, however, in the ingressive construction would not
significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Lango lacks the 'take'
construction (Lord 1973), found frequently in West African serializing languages and used there to mark direct objects and instruments and as a
causative marker, as well as other functions. Because of its widespread use
and its ability to take on sentence functional interpretations, this verb is
a fine candidate for reanalysis. Perhaps the frequent use of serialization
in some West African languages has gone hand-in-hand with the frequent
use of the 'take' construction. Lango lacks any verb in parataxis or
serialization with the generality of the 'take' construction. The various
words for 'take' in Lango play no special role in parataxis or serialization,
'give', another frequent participant in serial constructions across languages, does have a regular role in a paratactic construction in Lango.
But miy- 'give' does not mark indirect objects in Lango, unlike similar
verbs in West African serializing languages, and has a regular role only
in the causative construction, which has not been reanalyzed as serial (see
footnote 156). It may be that the lack of a 'take' construction or something
similar is an important factor in the predominance of parataxis over
serialization in Lango.
We come now to the matter of the difficulty of embedding paratactic
constructions. As noted in the sections above, paratactic constructions can
be embedded as relative clauses and as complements to factive and utterance predicates. They cannot be converted into infinitives or subjunctives, unlike serials — the paratactic construction would in any case be
incompatible with the irrealis interpretation of the subjunctive. It is easy
to understand why paratactic constructions can be embedded as complements to utterance predicates, where they would simply serve as reports
of assertions. But their restriction otherwise to relative clauses and factive complements is, on the surface at least, rather puzzling. In these environments, they represent old, backgrounded information. One possibleGrammatical status of parataxis and serialization265reason why they occur here and not in other sorts of embedded environments is that, as background information, the interpretation of the construction is semantically unaffected by the matrix predication. Since it is
a feature of the paratactic construction when non-embedded that each
clause is taken to be separately asserted, even to the point where the second
clause is not semantically (as opposed to pragmatically) affected by the
first, this relationship between the clauses can be preserved when the construction is backgrounded but not when the construction is semantically
affected by the matrix predication.","[277, 278, 279, 280, 281]"
"8.4 Existence, location, and possession
Existential and presentative constructions are formed with tie 'to exist,
be present' when affirmative and pe or mom 'to not exist, not be present'
when negative. The subjects in existential sentences are almost always accompanied by -moro, the indefinite affix (Sec. 8.7.4):
(1)gwok'karo tie i 5t
dog-indef 3s-be+present-hab in house
'there's a dog in the house'(2)cennoro pe
ghost-indef 3s-be + not-t-present-hab
'there are no ghosts'Locative expressions are formed in the same manner:
(1)tiekan3s-be+present-hab here
'it's here'148The syntax of simple sentences(2)kwac mom
L. 3s-be+not+present-hab
'Leopard wasn't there'Possessive sentences are also formed with these existential predicates.
Three patterns have been observed, differing primarily in thematic structure. When the possessor is topic, the following is likely to be used:
(1)okelo tie gwok
O. 3s-be+present-hab with dog
Okelo has a dog'This structure contrasts with (2), used when the possessed item is topic:
(2)gwök tie bot ökelo
dog 3s-be+present-hab to O.
'the dog is OkeloBoth patterns are negated by substituting pe or mom for tie. When the
possessor and possessed are topics as a unit, the following syntagm involving topicalization (Sec. 8.7.3) of the possessor is commonly encountered:
(3)okelo gwok'kere pe
O. dog-3sa 3s-be + not+present-hab
Okelo doesn't have a dog'In translating the English absolute possessive pronouns (mine, yours,
etc.), two constructions are possible. One can either use the usual possessive sentence construction,
(1)gwokki tie bota
dog-this 3s-be+present-hab to-ls
'this dog is mine'or one can use the preposition me 'for, in order to' conjugated for person
— see Sec. 5.6.3 for paradigms and discussion:
(2)gwokki rnera
dog-this for-Is
'this dog is mine'(3)gwokki meri
dog-this for-2s
'this dog is yours'This construction is also available for nouns,
(4)gwokki me ojisk
dog-this for O.
'this dog is Ojuk's'Deviations from basic order1498.5 Deviations from basic order
Lango permits remarkably few deviations from the basic order outlined
in Sec. 8.1. Aside from some variation in the placement of indirect objects and adverbiale, only topicalization can affect the simple linear
order of constituents in the simple sentence.
8.5.1 Variation in the placement of the indirect objectThe syntax of lO's was discussed in Section 1.1 and will only be summarized
here. The IO can be placed immediately after the verb, in which case it,
and not the DO, conditions object verb agreement. Alternately, the IO can
be made the object of bot 'to' and placed after the DO:
(1)rwot omiya dyarjking 3s-give-perf-ls cow
'the king gave me a cow'
(2)rwot ömiö dyärj botaking 3s-give-perf cow to-Is
'the king gave the cow to me'
There are fewer constraints on datives assuming the advanced position (and hence making anaphora on the verb) than in English. 101 For instance there is no general constraint restricting advanced lO's with
pronominalized DO's, as in English:
(3)*the king gave me itIn Lango non-human third person anaphora is indicated by transitive
verb alone: Both advanced and non-advanced (i.e. with bot) lO's are
possible:
(4)rwot omiyaking 3s-give-perf-ls
'the king gave it to me'
(5)rwot omio botaking 3s-give-perf to-ls
'the king gave it to me'
However, if a human third person DO pronoun is present, only the nonadvanced IO is possible:
(6)rwot ocwale botaking 3s-send-perf-3s to-ls
'the king sent him to me'150The syntax of simple sentences
(7)*rwot öcwälä enking 3s-send-perf-ls him
'the king sent me him'
This, however, simply reflects the more general constraint that object
pronouns must be attached to their head (either verb or preposition); independent pronouns (like en) can only be used in addition to the suffixed
pronouns for contrastive emphasis in post-verbal position. Advanced and
non-advanced lO's do not differ semantically in the sense that there will be
no truth value differences between them, but they do differ pragmatically.
Lango has no system of articles for indicating definiteness, and though certain nominal affixes such as the demonstratives can be used for this purpose, they are not regularly employed in this way. Definiteness must be
inferred from previous discourse and background knowledge, aided by
placement of the NP within the sentence. Generally speaking, the closer an
NP is to the front of the sentence, the more likely it is to be interpreted as
definite. Since indirect objects, on straightforward pragmatic grounds, are
highly likely to be definite anyway, ' it is the placement of the DO that is
most affected by the possibilities illustrated in (1) and (2) above. When the
DO is last, as in (1) it is more likely to receive an indefinite interpretation
than when it is followed by the IO as in (2). The glosses provided for the
sentences reflect this.
8.5.2 TopicalizationTopicalization involves the displacement of an NP from its usual position
to the beginning of the sentence.103 A topicalized NP is always interpreted as definite or generic. Further, it is interpreted as the topic or
orientation of the sentence, a role otherwise played by the subject. 4
Only one NP per sentence can be topicalized. This NP can be a DO or
IO, an object of a preposition, an associative NP, or even an NP in a subordinate clause:
(1)abwor rwot tamo ni enekolion king 3s-think-hab comp 3s-kill-perf
'the lion, the king thinks that he killed it'
When the topicalized NP is an object of a preposition, a benefactive, or an
associative NP, a pronominal copy must be left in the original position:
(2)an rwot omiyo dyag botaI king 3s-give-perf cow to-Is
was given the cow by the king'
(3)okelo aneno palamerSO. ls-see-perf knife-3sa
Okelo, I saw his knife'Deviations from basic order151If the topicalized NP is a first or second person pronoun, a pronominal
copy must be left in the original position regardless of what syntactic position the topicalized NP originates:
(4)an kec änekka tütwäl
I hunger 3s-kill-prog-ls very+much
Tm really hungry' (lit: 'hunger is killing me very much')(5)yin däkö omiyi dyelyou woman 3s-give-perf-2s goat
'you were given a goat by the woman'
When the topicalized NP is a human third person DO or IO, it need not
leave a pronominal copy:
(6)locä kec anekko tutwalman hunger 3s-kill-prog very+much
'the man is very hungry*
(7)locä kec änekke tutwal
man hunger 3s-kill-prog-3s very+much
'the man is very hungry'However, non-human third person DO's never leave a pronominal copy:
(8)
/C\ \apwo atxn oncno
hare child 3s-see-perf
'the hare was seen by the child'
VA\ j A^V*There is a special construction available for topicalizing noun subjects.
This is invariably found in discourse contexts where an old topic is
reintroduced (Sec. 10.1). In this construction, the pronoun en 'he, she, it' or
gin 'they' is placed in sentence initial position followed by the noun subject:
(1)gin rwodi tetek
they kings 3p-strong-hab
'kings are very powerful'(2)okelo ödök
he O. 3s-go-fback-perf
Okelo went back'This is referred to as the reinforced subject construction in Sec. 10.1.
In terms of the typology suggested by Li and Thompson (1976), Lango
is a subject prominent language. One effect of this is that Lango does not
have sentences like the following:
Mandarin
(1) nei-chang huo xingkui xiaofang-dui lai de kuai
that-classifier fire fortunate fire-brigade come adv-part quick
'that fire (topic), fortunately the fire brigade came quickly'
(Li and Thompson 1976, p. 462)152The syntax of simple sentencesJapanese
(2) sakana wa tai ga oisiifish part red-snapper part delicious-is
'fish (topic), red snapper is the most delicious'
(Kuno 1973, p. 62)
where NP's that are neither arguments of the verb nor associatives are
topicalized. Note, however, that topics from subordinate or parallel
clauses are possible (Sec. 9.9.1, 11.2). Topics that are not subjects play a
much larger role in Lango syntax than in English, having certain properties normally attributed to subjects (Noonan and Bavin 1978, Sections
9.10and 11.1).
Notice that question words (Sec. 8.9) can never be topicalized because they are not, by definition, definite and cannot be the sentence
orientation.
Right dislocation seems to occur only as an afterthought phenomenon
in Lango, and not as a part of a regular strategy for rightmost placement
of topics (unlike other Nilotic languages, such as Nandi). 106
8.5.3 Variation in the placement of adverbialeIn Sec. 8.1, it was noted that adverbials may be placed either at the beginning or end of the sentence:
(1)awo'ro akelo odwogo
yesterday O. 3s-come+back-perf
'Yesterday, Okelo came back'(2)okelo odwogo awo'roO. 3s-come-i-back-perf yesterday
Okelo came back yesterday'
(1) is appropriate when the adverbial is background and the rest of the
sentence, or at least odwogo, is being asserted. (2) is appropriate when
the adverbial is being asserted. (1) is a felicitous response to (3), and (2)
to (4):
(3)awo'ro okelo otimo go?yesterday O. 3s-do-perf what
'yesterday, what did Okelo do?'
(4)okelo odwogo awene?","[163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168]"
"Expression of passive senses1538.6 Expression of passive senses
Lango has no morphological passive. However, the pragmatic function of
a passive, which is essentially to create a new sentence orientation out of
a patient in a transitive relationship,
is taken over in part by secondary
orientation verbs (Sec. 8.2.1) and the middle voice (Sec. 8.2.2), and in part
by topicalization (Sec. 8.5.2).108
While SA verbs and the middle voice fulfill the function of permitting
patients in transitive relationships to be subjects, they do not allow for the
expression of the transitive agent and lack the true semantic aspects of
the passive. That is, they lack the sense of the transitive patient acted upon
by the transitive agent. Topicalized sentences come closer to passives in
this regard. Notice that sentences with SA verbs or verbs in the middle
voice are never translated as passives, but topicalized sentences frequently are. Our bilingual Lango-English informants would usually translate
sentences like the following with the English passive:
(1)an rwot onenI king 3s-see-perf-ls
Ί was seen by the king'
Notice, however, that not all topicalized sentences can be translated with
the English passive, e.g. sentences where the topicalized element is not
the DO. Further, topicalization remains fundamentally different from passive — the topicalized NP does not become subject (see Sec. 11.1).
It should also be noted that Lango has no impersonal construction.
To a certain extent, the sense of an impersonal can be rendered by an indefinite subject,
(1)gattoro ojwato όρίό
person-indef 3s-hit-perf O.
'someone hit Opio'or a subjectless verb conjugated in the third person singular:
(2)ojwato όρίο
3s-hit-perf O.
'he/someone hit Opio'8.7 The organization of the noun phrase
Nouns are not marked for case and are not lexically specified for concord
class. They may, however, be inflected for singular and plural number
(Sec. 8.7.7). Pronouns and agreement inflections on verbs reflect only the
categories of number and person.","[168, 169]"
"278Endnotes71. This is surely related to the -g- element in the plural forms of the
independent demonstrative and associative pronouns. Note also the independent 3p pronoun gin.
72. Etymologically, it does not appear to be the attributive particle. Acholi,
which would have mä corresponding to Lango attributive a in these cases,
also has the a""- prefix before numerals, not ma.
73. In order to account for the lack of gemination in abicel, we might suppose (given that the form is synchronically derived and not lexical, which
is doubtful) that the final /c/ in abi exhibits the 0/y/c alternation (Sec.
1.4.4). Note also the aharmonic vowels in this word, which reflect the
word's origin in a compound.
74. Notice that 6 and 9 have aharmonic vowels typical of compounds,
but 7 (given that /i/ is from abic) does not.
75. One informant gave the form as pyerä. However, since the form in
actual use is always followed by a word beginning with the prefix a-, the
final vowel of pyerä would always be lost in coalescence (Sec. 2.7).
76. In Acholi, the word for 1000 is elfo.
77. Though 4 we n (Driberg's orthography) lacks the a- prefix.
78. The spread of Acholi numbers has probably been encouraged by the
common schooling of Acholi and Lango children, though even in Driberg's
time some Langi were using Acholi numbers (p. 312).
79. Notice that coalescence (Sec. 2.7) is not responsible for the loss of
a-: the tone of a- is not preserved and in any case, the vowel /a/ is
preserved in coalescence in external sandhi.
80. Givon 1979 comments on the unusualness of external negation in
natural language.
81. Even in its role as a simple negative marker, pecan take subject agreement affixes (Sec. 8.2.6).
82. This is something of an oversimplification since it's quite possible that
not all languages have subjects (Schachter 1976, Noonan 1977) and even
among those that clearly do employ subjects, some sentences may still be
subjectless (Noonan 1978).
83. In English, where detransitivizing is not accompanied by a change inEndnotes279verbal morphology, the presence or absence of an intransitive valence
scheme for verbs like eat and punch is governed by pragmatic factors, such
as whether the activity described by the verb is sufficiently interesting or
descriptive without reference to an object, and whether the object itself is
relevant or predictable. For instance, the verb hit resembled punch in that
it did not use an intransitive valence scheme. But after its adoption by the
game of baseball as a name for a characteristic activity within the game,
an intransitive valence scheme came to be used with this verb, but only
within the context of the game:
(1) he hit twice in the seventh inning
This issue will be discussed further in Sec. 8.2.1.3.
84. Generalized valence schemes usually have a characteristic meaning
component.
85. The expression 'secondary argument' verb was chosen as a way of
referring to the most salient characteristic of these verbs, namely, that
their subjects correspond to the direct objects (secondary arguments)
of the corresponding transitives. (The subject is the 'primary
argument'.) The term 'patientive' was considered and rejected since not
all such secondary arguments are patients: some, as noted below, are
agents.
The terms Tr, AN, and SA correspond to the traditional terms
'applicative', 'qualitative', and 'neuter', respectively, but some investigators have used the term 'qualitative' so as to make it more-or-less
synonymous with neuter (e.g. Malandra 1955 and Mantovani 1963).
The traditional terms are rejected here because their meanings are not
immediately obvious to non-Niloticists and where they are used elsewhere they are often used with a somewhat different sense. In earlier
work on Lango, I have referred to secondary argument (SA) verbs as
'secondary orientation' (SO) verbs. I hope this change in terminology
will cause no confusion or inconvenience.
In what follows, the terms Tr, AN, and SA will be used both as labels
for generalized valence schemes and as labels for particular verbs exhibiting these valence schemes.
86. The final vowel may be -o, -o, -v, or -u depending on vowel harmony
considerations (Sec. 2.5.2 and Noonan and Bavin 1979). -vr and -u are
found only in a few roots whose root vowel is M or /u/ (Sec.2.8.2). For
simplicity, we will refer to this vowel, known as the 'stem vowel' (Sec.
5.1.2) simply as -o. There are only three transitive verbs that do not have
-o. kwiyä 'to not know' has -a, yee 'to believe' has no final vowel (the e is
a root vowel), dagi 'to refuse, not want' lacks gemination of Cg and has
final -i. The -i is deleted when the DO is not pronominal:280Endnotes
(1)ädägi
ls-refuse-habTrrefuse it'
(2)ädäg ringo
ls-refuse-hab meat
refuse meat'TrThe gemination of Cg indicated for Tr stems is found only in the infinitive and forms built, historically and synchronically, off the infinitive
such as the progressive aspect and the periphrastic future construction.
We have, then, for Tr kanno 'to hide':
(1)akano bakci
ls-hide-perf box
hid the box'Tr(2)akänno bakci
ls-hide-prog box
'I'm hiding the box'Tr(3)abino kanno bakci
ls-come-hab hide-infin box
'I'll hide the box'TrIn the perfective and habitual aspects and the subjunctive, Cg is not
geminated for Tr verbs, but the final -o is retained throughout the conjugation, except in the subjunctive.
When the verb root lacks C2, -y- is found in place of gemination: Tr
köayö, AN k55 'to leave out, isolate, pick out among'. This is true also for
the benefactive (Sec. 8.2.3).
A very small number of roots lack.gemination of C2 altogether, suffixing instead -oro to the root: Tr dokoro 'to cross over'. See Sec. 5.3 for
a detailed discussion of the morphology of verbs.
87. See Sec. 5.3.1 and references given there for a detailed description of
the morphology of Tr, AN, and SA verbal forms.
88. Lango, in fact, has no morphological passive. The usual functions of
a passive are taken over in part by SA verbs, in part by the middle voice
(Sec. 8.2.2), and in part by topicalization (Sec. 8.6 and Noonan and Bavin
1978b).
Notice that the universal characterization of passive by Perlmutter and
Postal (1977) would include the Tr/SA relation. Evidence given in the text
indicates that it is not passive. If the Lango Tr/SA relation is indeed not
active/passive, then we have here evidence that passive is fundamentally
a meaning relation, the structural relation being secondary.","[293, 294, 295, 296]"
"Endnotes269The third singular progressive prefix seems to have derived from yaa
'go', so that here, too, cluster simplification seems to have been at work,
with lyl patterning, as noted above, with the anterior consonants.
10. There are a very few words for which gemination would have to be indicated lexically. All of these are either borrowings,
pamma
tanna
koppo
cüggu'cotton'
'bed'
'cup'
'black ant'(from Swahili pamba)
(from Swahili ki-tanda)
(from English cup of)
(from Swahili chuguu 'ant heap')or are complex in origin, though the latter may not be easily segmentable:
okko
wokki'completely, entirely, utterly'
'a few minuts ago'
'plant yielding strong rods'Such words may represent the vanguard of lexical gemination in Lango,
though there is a tendency, especially with the borrowings, to degeminate:
tanna becomes tänä 'bed' for many speakers. (See also Sec. 4.3.) At this
stage, such cases of gemination are still few, and the great majority of
cases of gemination are morphophonemically predictable.
1 1. Only one exception, cäwa 'time, clock', was recorded. This, however,
is clearly a borrowing, ultimately from Arabic. An alternate pronunciation caa also exists, and seems to be more common.
12. When one of the flanking vowels is /i/, /n/ may be retained in careful
speech:
/wärj+ä/
/wärj+£/—*·
-+[wää] 'my eye'
[wtt] 'his eye'/wan+i/-»[wärji] or [waTT] 'your eye'but:13. Recall that [q] does occur intervocallically in environment B:
/i + rjülü/ -»
2s-spit-perf
'you spat'[irjulü]14. In ordinary Lango orthography, / / is always written in such words:
nyango
orunga
orangaornyarjo
ogurja
oraga270EndnatesLiterate Langi insist that an / / is present in such cases, but whether this
results from their training in the orthography or from some deeper intuition about phonological segments, I cannot say.
15. Actually, as pointed out in endnote 9, modern ä represents a conflation of earlier pa and ma, both in form and function. Gemination and
devoicing are understandable before historic pä, the associative particle.
Gemination and voicing would be expected before the historic adjectival
particle ma, but in fact devoicing, not the expected voicing, occurs before
attributive adjectives:
pig ä räc
-»·
pikk a räc
juice att+part 3s-bad-hab
'bad juice'(not *pigg a räc)gwök ä räc
—*
gwokk ä räc
dog att+part 3s-bad-hab
'bad dog'(not *gwogg a räc)This attests the complete merger of the two forms.
The loss of the initial consonant noted above is a regular feature of
Lango vis-ä-vis its relatives. A number of prepositions, particles, and noun
prefixes have lost such particles:
Lango
ä
iAcholi
pa/mä
ki'attributive particle'
'in, about, with, to, from'ä-tinlä-tin'child'Not all such words have lost their initial consonants, however:
pipi'according to'kaka'ifThe loss of these consonants has had a lingering effect on Lango phonology. See Sec. 1.6 for discussion of the 'zero consonant' phenomenon.
16. Between /i/ and /a/ there is, inevitably, a slight excrescent [y].
17. Gregerson (1974) notes similar alternations in other Western Nilotic
languages.
18. An analysis involving epenthesis is more convenient from a
synchronic perspective than an alternative analysis which posits the /r/
in underlying forms because, these forms apart, the putative /r/ does
not figure in any other phonological processes (e.g. gemination). That
/r/ was present in some of these forms historically is clear: Lango pi
'according to' corresponds to Shilluk per 'like, similar'; the /r/ surfacesEndnotes271in the irregular plural of päkö 'girl', apira 'girls', etc. In some of the
other forms with epenthetic /r/, in particular the other propositions,
the /r/ may have spread analogically.
19. Jakobson (1978) reports that Luo has no vowel corresponding to Lango
/a/ (Tucker and Bryan's /ä/). Knappen (1963) omits mention of any similar
vowel in his brief discussion of Alur vowels. Acholi, however, agrees with
Lango in having /a/.
It should be noted that /a/ is the least common of the basic vowels
in Lango, amounting to only about 2% of the root vowels in the language. It is very rare in nominal roots, somewhat more common in
verbs, especially in intransitive stems, and most common in expressive
vocabulary.
20. Similar descriptions exist for other Souther Lwo languages — for
example, Knappert's (1963) for Alur.
21. Ladefoged seems to have switched the glosses for some of his laryngealized/non-laryngealized pairs, but his intent to distinguish creaky
Class B from non-creaky A seems clear, nonetheless.
22. In Section 1.1, it was noted that voiced consonants are sometimes
heard with a murmured voice quality. This feature is likely a stylistic one.
In my admittedly limited experience, it seemed limited to female
speakers, though I haven't investigated the matter sufficiently to state
this as a fact. In any case, this occurence of murmured voice quality did
not correlate with Class A vowels. In no one's speech was it an invariant
feature.
23. However, as Lindau (1978) notes, a forward movement of the tongue
root (which results in a wider pharynx and a lowering of the larynx) results
in a lowering of fi, having an effect, then, similar to the raising of the
tongue. Advanced tongue root position will be discussed below.
24. In case the reader had begun to wonder, native speakers have no
difficulty in distinguishing minimal pairs such as these.
25. The vowels in this figure are plotted according to a technique described
in Ladefoged (1975), the vertical axis represents fi while the horizontal
axis represents fg minus fi.
26. Jacobson found that Luo speakers differ as to whether tongue height
or pharynx width serves as the primary distinguishing characteristic,
though both seem to be employed to some degree by all speakers.","[284, 285, 286, 287]"
"272Endnotes,27. Tucker (1958) records ittä for my yitto 'to climb'. His form is identical to the current Acholi pronunciation and was identified as such by the
one informant who was presented with it. In fact, Lango always seems to
have glides where Acholi has root initial high vowels. Comparative
evidence is rather mixed as to which language has the older form, but it
is interesting to note that in this respect Lango agrees with its Northern
Lwo cousins instead of its Southern Lwo siblings:ear

yumi.tyi«twum28. An example of a symmetric vowel harmony system is Turkish, where
any vowel occupying a certain position determines the set of vowels for
the entire word.
29. One exception of sorts is described under Roman numeral V below.
30. None of my informants accepted these forms, but Okello (1975), a
native speaker, finds them acceptable.
31. For some speakers, stem vowel -o is possible also with root vowel c:
pyetto or pyetto
'to sieve (tr)'
32. In very slow, deliberate speech, coalescence need not occur. All the
forms given below represent ordinary, conversational speech tempo.
33. The phonological effect of ä when it is intervocalic is to prevent coalescence between stem vowels and following prefixes, as in example (4). It
is only when it occurs between two consonants that it surfaces without
coalescence:
ä pe ot5o -*· paruja pe o'too
crocodile att+part not 3s-die-perf-rel
'a crocodile that's not dead'
34. There are, however, a number of trisyllabic words containing downstepped highs that are synchronically unanalyzable into component
mophemes and, therefore, never show an alternation between the
pattern and anything else:Endnotes
äle'te'flute'äbwo'ri
öbi'a'eland'
[_~~]
'a grass used for thatching'273[The
pattern is also unaffected by tone sandhi.] In such cases, those
favoring concrete models might wish to posit underlying
sequences.
In a more abstract analysis, a L HL H tonal contour can be posited for
these words, the surface tone contour resulting from the application of
the rule of Underlying Fall Simplification, as discussed in Sec. 4.4 below.
35. For this reason there is no need to posit a mid tone in Lango since the
downstepped high is not a freely occuring tone.
36. As noted in Sec. 2.2, underlying or contracted contour tones occur with
long vowels. Thus the difference between
atck[_—Mls-strong-hab
'I'm strong'
and
äräc[_~\1ls-bad-hab
Tm bad'
(where the contour in tek 'strong' is underlying, but that in räc 'bad' comes
about via tone sandhi) is more a consequence of vowel length than of any
real tonal difference. The long vowel in tek persists only at the end of intonational phrases, merging with the sort found in äräc when phrase internal, and is shortened if the vowel loses its contour tone in sandhi. As
far as tone sandhi and other phonological processes are concerned, the
two falling tones are treated identically. They are potentially contrastive
only with certain intransitive verbs where they can be used to distinguish
perfective from habitual aspect (Se. 5.3.2). Only in that context are they
transcribed differently in this grammar.
Where vowels are lengthened, as, for example, before word final /r/,
falling tones resemble those in (1):
d6g äbwor->dog abwörmouth lion
'a lion's mouth'
37. Synchronically, the generalization that surface LH is found only in
words with L H alternants is too strong since some subjunctives, those ending in resonants (Sec. 5.3.2), do not take the -i suffix and so do not exhibit the alternation. So, for example, there is no *yei 'carry it on the
head!' alongside ye, nor is there an *ökwäni alongside okwän '(that) he274Endnotesread'. Still, the alternation is part of the subjunctive paradigm even if all
verbs do not undergo it.
38. As late as the 1950's, Tucker (1955) recorded a set of monosyllabic
nouns with a LH tone pattern. Words such as his get 'side' I've recorded
only with L get, though these words behave in tone sandhi as though they
were still LH. See the discussion of the LH nouns in Sec. 4.4.2 below (endnote 44).
Also, there is a set of verb prefixes which must be analyzed as morphophonemically LH, though they never surface as LH, appearing in verb
citation forms as L. See Sec. 5.3.1.
39. doggola'mere 'the door', -mere is one of the few disyllabic suffixes.
40. The word loc» is an exception. The H_ L pattern in citation forms could
arise regularly only given an underlying H_ L with intervening gemination, or from an underlying HL L, as appears to be the case with loca.
Word internal, non-morphologically conditioned gemination is not found
in native vocabulary (but see endnote 10).
41. As pointed out in Sec. 1.2.3, lexical gemination in Lango as results
from clusters originating in compounds. Words like pämmä 'cotton' immediately strike a Lango speaker as non-native.
42. See Goldsmith (1976) and the papers in Clements and Goldsmith
(1984).
43. Other treatments of Lango tone sandhi can be found in Tucker (1955),
Maddieson et al (1974), Okello (1975), and Dwyer (1983).
In the rules that follow, formal elegance is sacrificed for descriptive
convenience and clarity of exposition. The only formal device employed
is extrinsic ordering.
44. Which means that the citation forms of nouns like ty£n, git, etc. will
have L, an instance where the citation form and the underlying form differ.
This state of affairs is apparently recent for this set of nouns, as noted in
endnote 38.
A list of nouns with underlying LH tone is given below:
tyen
läk
bad
jag
get
kin'leg, foot'
tug
'tooth'
c5g
'arm'
ySn
'branch'
dan
'side'
man
'space between''horn'
'knee'
'prepuce' 'palate'
'scrotum'lern
bwöm
but
wit
b5'cheek'
'wing'
'side, flank'
'ear of grain'
'new leaves'Notice that all of these forms would ordinarily occur as the head of anEndnotes275inalienable associative construction (Sec. 8.7.2) as most of them denote
body parts.
45. Okello (1975, pi 75ff) accepted some forms which were rejected by my
informants, e.g. atil tidi 'the antelope is small' (p. 179) — my informants
preferred atil 'tidi, as did Tucker's. Tucker (1955, p. 148) gives ätin 'tidi;
Okello would have, presumably, ätin tidi.
46. H(L)'s constitute the only real exception to the generalization made
in Sec. 4.4.1 that the underlying tone pattern is preserved in Lango.
Chet Creider (pers. comm.) has suggested that the behavior of H(L)
nouns could be formally accounted for by positing a floating L tone. This
solution could account for the regular behavior of these nouns as well as
their irregular behavior in prepausal position. Their behavior with inalienable associative suffixes would remain anomalous, however.
47. More accurately Ci(G)VC2- 'C' is interpreted here formally to mean
both obtruent and glide.
48. The main difference between verbs and adjectives in Lango is that
verbs have no lexical tone but adjectives do. See Sec. 5.4.1.
49. These stem vowels are characteristic of the Lwo languages. In some of
these, e.g. Shilluk, the stem vowel falls into the category of the 'semi-mute'
or 'shadow' vowels described by Vine (1984). In Lango, the stem vowel is
fully pronounced, but it is a frequent victim of deletion via coalescence, in
both internal and external sandhi (Sec. 2.6, 2.7, and below Sec. 5), and contraction (Sec. 5.1.2.2).
50. Okello (1975, p. 144) records the interesting form odoge 'elders', which
has both the plural agent noun prefix and the ordinary plural suffix -e.
The usual form is odorp. I've recorded a few such forms as well, e.g. owote
'friends' (from wot 'go, walk').
51. The suffix -mere appears to be a new form in Lango, replacing earlier
•ne. It derives from the conjugated preposition mere 'for him/her*.
52. In alienable possession with pronominal affixes, the word tyeii 'leg'
occasionally appears as tyene-, as in:
tyenenaleg-lsa
'my leg of meat'
One informant identified this as Old Lango'.","[287, 288, 289, 290, 291]"
"5.2.2 Agent nounsAgent nouns are formed by prefixing to the root ä- for the singular and
o- for the plural. Both prefixes condition zero-consonant effects - see Sec.
1.6. (The nominalizing prefixes a- and o- discussed in the last section do
not condition zero-consonant effects.) A variety of stem vowels can be
found with agent nouns; some have no stem vowel at all.
Agent nouns are formed from roots whose basic sense is verbal, adjectival, adverbial, and even nominal. They can refer to people, animals, or
objects, though with an instrumental cast to the sense of the latter. They
can be made from compounds and even from phrases containing conjugated verbs - for the latter, see Sec. 7. Agent nouns are commonly encountered in spoken Lango.

5.2.3 Personal namesPersonal names in Lango generally consist of the prefix o- for masculine
names and a- for feminine names added to a root that refers to some circumstance attending the birth of the individual bearing the name. Some
of these names are analyzable from the standpoint of modern Lango,
others are not:

(from bäpä 'debt')5.2.4 Associative paradigmsIn this section we are concerned with the suffixation on nouns of associative pronouns, both alienable and inalienable. For the alienable/inalienable distinction, see Sec. 8.7.2.
The singular associative suffixes can be divided into two groups, the
plural associatives showing no such distinction:78The structure ofLango words

second person singular (2sa)
third person singular (3sa)
first person plural (Ipa)
second person plural (2pa)
third person plural (3pa)AB-a
-e or e-na
-mere
-wa
-wu
-gfThe A set are suffixed to consonant final nouns in inalienable associative
constructions. The set are attached to vowel final nouns in inalienable
associatives and to all nouns in alienable associatives:
(2)
tyin 'leg're mo 'blood'Inalienable
tyin + ä
'my leg'
[tyfenä]Alienable
ty£n + na
'my (animal) leg'
[tyfcnna]remo + na
'my blood'
[remönä]remo + na
'my (animal) blood'
[remönä]The plural affixes are used for both alienable and inalienable associative
constructions:
(3)tyfcn + wa52
Our legs'
[tyfenwa]tyin + wa
Our (animal) legs'
[ty nwä]In general, the suffixation of these forms involves simply the application of the ordinary tone sandhi (Sec. 4.4.2), cluster simplification (Sec.
1.2.3), and vowel harmony rules (Sec. 2.5.2) already discussed. There are,
however, a number of irregularities, particularly as regards the suffixation of the A set. Let us first consider the more regular cases involving the
suffixation of the B set and the plurals.
Below are some paradigms illustrating the suffixation of the B set and
the plurals to nouns exemplifying the various tonal possibilities. All the
following involve alienable possession, but recall that an inalienably possessed noun with a final vowel would inflect in exactly the same way. Underlined vowels are stressed:

simplification. As with coalescence, the tone of the stem vowel is absorbed
into the root.

noun like gwok 'dog', we have the expected gwok'wä.
wie 'head', yic 'belly', and gee 'back', words which exhibit the 0/y/c
alternation (Sec. 1.4.4), have the 0 alternant before inalienable associative suffixes. However, because of the presence of the morphophoneme

"Notes
1. The discussion in this and other sections of the phonology draws freely
on Okello (1975), an especially valuable source since Okello is a native
speaker of Lango. However, because this grammar utilizes the speech of
several Langi, has a broader scope and a different theoretical basis, the
details of the phonology presented here differ in a number of respects
from those presented by Okello.
2. Lango has been in fairly close contact with English over the last half
century, and as a result certain English sounds traditionally not heard in
Lango may occasionally be encountered especially among educated
speakers. For example, the labio-dental fricative [v] can be heard in
[gävmente] 'government' alongside the more usual pronunciations
[gabmente] and [gäbämente].
3. Words may consist simply of a root morpheme or a root morpheme plus
stem vowel (Sec. 5.1.2). To either the root of the root plus stem vowel
various affixes may be added: all affixes are vowel final (Sec. 5.1.3).
4. bwogo was the only word consistently recorded with a [bw] cluster. Since
Lango [b] corresponds to Acholi [b] and [bw], it is reasonable to suppose
that Lango [bw] merged with [b]. Either bwogo exceptionally escaped the
[bw] to [b] shift or [bw] has been reinserted under Acholi influence. Also,
[bwöm] was recorded alongside [born] 'wing', the former being labelled as
'sounding like Acholi' by the one speaker who was questioned about the
form.
5. The sequence [ny] does not occur. Since C in Cy combinations is phonetically palatalized, [ny] would be very close phonetically to [ji] and would
presumably by interpreted as such.
6. Environment B applies also to consonants which were historically stem
initial, but synchronically would probably not be analyzed as such:
[aw6no]'guinea fowl'
'lion'(ä- is an historic prefix)
(e- is an historic prefix)[w] and [rj] are found in B, but are excluded from C, which includes all
other intervocalic positions. Notice that the (historic) stem-initial syllable
is stressed (stressed syllables have underlined vowels in this text).
Synchronically it may be stress, rather than morphological boundaries that
defines environment B, though a purely stressed based characterization
might run into difficulties with reduplications like:268Endnotes
ä-gi-gicl s-cold-redup-hab
Tm sort of cold'
It should be emphasized, however, that in most cases stress and environment B are straightforwardly determinable on the basis of morphological
structure.
7. Gemination in the formation of transitive infinitives seems historically
to be simply another case of gemination via cluster simplification. Driberg
(1923) lists forms like [libdö] corresponding to modern [lib»o] 'to lie in
wait', though Lango speakers do not now accept the former. In verbs,
where C2 of the CiVC2 root is 0, [y] is found in environments where
gemination of C2 would be expected. Compare the following:
ägälö
gal»odelayed it'
'to delay it'ätpoö 'I woke up smn'
tpo«yo 'to wake up smn'Synchronically, the transitive infinitive suffix could be viewed as -yo,
the /y/ conditioning cluster simplification. As noted in several places in
this grammar, /y/ patterns with the anterior consonants and not with
its fellow palatals (see, for example, footnote 9), suggesting an origin
for -yo that corresponds to the form above given by Driberg. Alternatively, one could view the appearance of [y] in [tpö»yö] as a case of/y/
epenthesis (Sec. 1.4.5).
8. These, too, seem to result historically from cluster simplification. The
benefactive stem, for example, derives historically from the root plus the
preposition pi:
- kel - pi - a -* okel»a3s-bring-for-lso
'he brought it for me'
In modern Lango, the historic /p/ in the suffix is never pronounced as such
even when it is suffixed to a root where C2 =0, e.g. me 'melt':
ime*ya2s-melt-ben-perf-lso
'you melted it for me'
See Sec. 1.4.5.
9. See Sec. 8.7.2 for a discussion of associative constructions. This, too,
seems to be historically just a case of cluster simplification. The modern
Lango attributive particle ä is a recent conflation of earlier pä
'associative' and ma 'adjectival', both recorded by Driberg and found still
in closely related Acholi. The geminated consonant may also be devoiced
— see Sec. 1.4.3.","[281, 282, 283, 284]"
"154The syntax of simple sentences8.7.1 Order of elements within the noun phraseThe head noun is always first in the Lango noun phrase. It is followed by,
in order, associative NP's, quantifiers, adjectives, and relative clauses.
Determiners normally occur last in the NP, but may precede relative
clauses. The order of elements is summed up as follows:
head-N ass-NP quant adj det rel-cl det
t
f
or
An example employing all the above elements follows:
(1)gwoggi a loca adekk a doip äme daködogs att-part man att-f part-three att-f part big rel + part
woman 3s-see-perf-this
'these three big dogs of the man that the woman saw'
All classes of noun modifiers can occur with the 'attributive particle'
ä, which is morphologically fused onto numerals and the relative particle
äme. If the final sound of the word preceding ä is a consonant, the consonant is geminated (if the final consonant is r, the preceding vowel is
lengthened instead). Final vowels are unaffected — see Sec. 1.2.3, 2.2.
(1)gwökk a loca
(gwök 'dog')
dog att+part man
'the man's dog'(2)dyäijrj ä dwog
(dyärj 'cow')
cow att+part big
'the big cow'(3)äbwoor ä räc
(äbwor 'lion')
lion att-f-part bad
'the bad lion'(4)päkö ä dit
(jiäkö 'girl')
girl att+part big
'the big girl'With the exception of the determiners and some peculiarities relating
to the associative constructions, the order in the NP is invariable. The syntax of the associative construction will be dealt with below in Sections 8.7.2
and 8.7.3. Relative clauses will be treated in Section 2.2.
Attributive adjectives always occur with the attributive particle (except when the latter is deleted phonologically as when followed by a
word beginning with a vowel (Sec. 2.7) the adjective agrees with the noun
it modifies in number, even if the noun itself displays no singular/plural
distinction:The organization of the noun phrase(1)155a. gwokkaber
dog att+part good-sg
'the good dog'
b. gwoggi ä becodogs att+part good-pi
'the good dogs'
(2)a. guluaberpot att+part good-sg
'the good pot'
b. gulu a beco
pot att+part good-pi
'the good pots'
Quantifiers also occur with the attributive particle. The numerals ten and
below have fused with the attributive particle so that the particle is part
of the numeral even when not used attributively:
(1)aryStiebotatwo 3s-be+present-hab to-ls
have two'
In this syntactic environment, when the head is not overt, other quantifiers do not take the attributive particle:
(2)pol tie bot»many 3s-be+present-hab to-ls
have many'
(cf gwoggi ä poldogs att+part many
'many dogs')
The quantifier ducu 'all, both' exceptionally never takes the attributive
particle:
(3)dok ducucattle all
'all the cattle'
The determiners (which include the demonstratives) normally occur
as suffixes on the last word of the NP:
(1)gwokkx
dog-this
'this dog'(2)gwokk a dwoggi
dog att+part big-sg-this
'this big dog'156The syntax of simple sentences(3)gwoggi ä doip aryoni
dogs att+part big-pi att+part-two-this
'these two big dogs'(The demonstrative -ni 'this' and -no 'that' lose their -n-, geminating final
consonants according to the usual consonant cluster simplification rules
of the language. When the NP includes a relative clause, the determiner
may be attached to the last word before the relative, be suffixed to the last
word in the relative, or occur in both positions at once:
(4)gwoggi ä dona aryoni äme loca onekoni
t
f
dogs att+part big two-this rel+part man 3s-kill-perf-this
'these two big dogs that the man killed'The longer the relative clause, the more likely the determiner is to be
positioned before it.
Nouns may be also modified by prepositional phrases, whose position within the NP is like that of the relative clause, i.e. last but for the
determiners:
(1)jo ipäco
people in village
'people in the village'(2)Dt ä dwoi) me bütü
house att+part big for sleep-infin
'a big house for sleeping'8.7.2 Associative constructionsAn associative construction consists of a noun head followed by an associative NP. The range of semantic relations that can be coded by associative
constructions include possession, but includes also a wide range of other
relationships. What is communicated by the construction per se is just an
association between two nouns; the exact relation is left to inference:
(1)gwokkäloca
dog att+part man
'the man's dog'(2)beer a kwän
good att+part read-infin
'the good of reading'(3)kwann ä okelo
read-infin att+part O.
Okelo's reading'The organization of the noun phrase(4)157okwänn a buk
readers att+part book
'the readers of the book'There are two sorts of associative constructions: The first codes inalienable
possession, the second codes all other associative relationships. The inalienable construction codes 'part-of relations, i.e. situations where the head
of the construction is interpreted as part of the noun coded as the associative,
as in the case of body parts. The inalienable associative does not take the attributive particle a — but other associatives do. Contrast the following:
inalienable
wi rwot
head king
'the king's head'alienable
wicc ä rwöt
head att+part king
'the king's (animal) head'(2)pyen äjägä
skin cat
'the cat's skin'pyenn a dako
skin att+part woman
'the hide belonging to the woman'(3)bad daktäl
arm doctor
'the doctor's arm'batt ä daktal
hand att+part doctor
'the doctor's foreleg of meat'(4)leb loca
tongue man
'the man's tongue'^PP * loca
tongue att+part man
'the man's tongue-meat'(1)Pictures, personal character, and anything else relating to the individual's
selfhood are inalienable:
(1)cälloca
picture man
'the man's picture'(2)kit IOC9
character man
'the man's character'Locative relationships are treated as inalienable,
(3)i läget mac
in side fire
'beside the fire'(4)i pirn bakci
in head chair
On the chair'(5)i wi komin head chair
On the chair'158The syntax of simple sentencesas are descriptive associatives and compounds in general (Sec. 7):
(6)5t cem
house food
'restaurant'Associative constructions with won 'father of, owner' as head are inalienable,
(7)won poto
owner field
'the owner of the field'as are blood relationships: sister-of, uncle-of, etc. (but see Sec. 5.2.4).
Familial relationships acquired through marriage are not considered inalienable in Lango:
(8)dako ä okelo
woman att+part O.
Okello's wife'However, some examples of inalienable possession with marriage relations have been recorded. Expressions of origin (in geography, manufacture, etc.) are inalienable:
(9)mon lira
women Lira
'the women of Lira'The inalienable associative is also used in a partitive sense:
(10) guludek
pot stew
'a pot of stew'
(11) m55 jiim
oil sesame
'sesame oil'
Pronominal associatives have a number of peculiarities. First, though
they too distinguish alienable from inalienable, both kinds are suffixes
and do not use the associative particle. Instead, the difference is indicated
by gemination (alienable) and its lack (inalienable) — see Sec. 5.2.4 for a
more complete discussion of associative affixes:
(1)(2)inalienable
pyena
skin-lsa
'my skin'alienable
pyenna
skin-lsa
'my (animal) hide'wiya
head-lsa
'my head'wicca
head-lsa
'my (animal) head'The organization of the noun phrase
(3)tyenatyennaleg-lsa
'my leg'leg-lsa
'my leg (of meat)'159When the head noun ends in a vowel, alienable and inalienable possession
cannot be distinguished, as we see with remo 'blood':
(4)(5)remomereremomeriblood-3sa
'his blood'blood-3sa
'his (animal) blood'remonaremonablood-Isa
'my blood'blood-Isa
'my (animal) blood'When contraction takes place (Sec. 5.1.2.2, 5.2.4), the forms can be distinguished:
(6)remeremmereblood-3sa
'his blood'blood-3sa
'his (animal) blood'The second peculiarity of pronominal associatives is that, though the
position of associative nouns is fixed (they immediately follow the head
noun), the position of pronominal associatives is variable. They occur
either suffixed to the head noun or the last element of the NP. Compare
the following sets:
(1)a. bukkaadwOQbook-lsa att+part big
'my big book'
b. bukk a dwoq'Qäbook att+part big-lsa
'my big book'
(2)a. bukke me akwänäbook-lsa for read-gerund
'my reading book'
b. buk me akwana'nabook for read-gerund-Isa
'my reading book'
8.7.3 Complex associativesIn referring to an individual, when it is the physical body not the personality that is at stake, it is usual (in some cases obligatory) to use a construction with kom 'body' as the head noun, with reference to the
individual expressed as an associative NP:160The syntax of simple sentences(1)kom loca gwebody man 3s-be+smelly-hab
'the man stinks'
(2)äjägä obedö i körn locacat 3s-sit-perf on bocy man
'the cat sat on the man'
With predicates like ijweyo 'to be smelly', kom is obligatory, kom is almost
always found after the ubiquitous preposition i, even when reference to
the physical body is not intended:
(3)otito i koma3s-tell-perf about body-lsa
'he told something about me'
r, unlike the other simple prepositions (Sec. 8.8), cannot take human pronominal objects and requires kom as a place to attach these object pronoun affixes.
When referring to emotional states, it is usual not to refer to the experiencer directly, but rather to attribute the emotion to the stomach yic
or liver cwip. The experiencer is expressed as an associative NP:
(4)yia a war) ni gwok'ka okao rwot
stomach-lsa 3s-burn-prog comp dog-lsa 3s-bite-perf king
'I'm upset that my dog bit the king'Other body part nouns are used in similar constructions.
When ko, yic, cwip, etc. are found in such constructions, a special sort
of associative is frequently encountered. This involves placing the associative noun first, and leaving a pronominal copy in its place. Compare (1)
above with (5):
(5)locä körne gweman body-3sa 3s-be+smelly-hab
'the man stinks'
This 'complex associative', though most common with body part head
nouns in subject position, can be found elsewhere:
(6)loca gwok'kcre"" obelo itinö
man dog-3sa 3s-frighten+away-perf children
'the man's dog frightened away the children'(7)gwök OQweo loca körnedog 3s-smell-perf man body-3sa
'the dog smelt the man'
The effect of the complex associative is to increase the prominence of the
associative NP, analogous to topicalization. In fact, when complex associatives appear in subject position, as in (5) and (6), they are indistinguishable from topicalized associatives.","[169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176]"
"Embedded cleft and topic constructions2379.9 Embedded cleft and topic constructions
9.9.1 Topic and cleft across sentence boundariesTopic NP's may cross clause boundaries:
(1) ogwag äwijio ni äläba akobbo ni ocwe
O. ls-hear-perf comp A. 3s-say-perf comp
3s-become+fat-perf
Ogwang, I heard Alaba was saying that he was fat'
(2) ogwas) alaba ämitto ni okelo okSpe
O. A. 3s-want-prog comp O. 3s-help-subj-3s
Ogwang, Alaba wants Okelo to help him'
They may also originate in infinitive phrases:
(3) ogwäg äläbä ämitto köjipe
O. A. 3s-want-prog help-infin-3s
Ogwang, Alaba wants to help him'
(4) ogwarj äläbä öbinö me kojipeO. A. 3s-come-perf for help-infin-3s
Ogwang, Alaba came to help him'
However, such sentences are a bit forced, though they are accepted and
understood.
Topicalization is clearly subject to Ross' (1967) Complex NP Constraint: NP's may not be topicalized out of relative clauses or noun complements. 133 The Coordinate Structure Constraint applies as well,
blocking the topicalization of an NP out of coordinated clause:
(1)öcämö rcc, enta okelo amato k5rj5O. 3s-eat-perf fish but O. 3s-drink-perf beer
Opio ate fish, but Okelo drank beer'
(2)*ökelööcamö rsc, entä ömätö k5rpO. O. 3s-eat-perf fish, but 3s-drink-perf beer
Okelo, Opio ate fish but he drank beer'
Notice, however, that topicalization applies across clause boundaries in
parataxis and serialization and is much more natural here than out of subordinate clauses:
(3) kal dakö odio icS opyetomillet woman 3s-press-perf man 3s-winnow-perf millet
the woman pressed the man, he winnowed it
'millet, the woman pressed the man to winnow it'238The syntax of complex sentences(4) okelo ögwäQ tek käte
O. O. 3s-strong-hab 3s-surpass-hab-3s
Okelo, Ogwang is stronger than him'
(cf relativization Sec. 9.2). This difference between parataxis and serialization, and true coordination will be discussed in Sec. 11.2.
Resumptive pronouns are obligatory for lO's and human DO's topicalized across clause boundaries (note that non-human NP's such as kal
'millet' in (3) do not have DO pronominal substitutes: the transitive verb
alone suffices in such cases):
(1) alabä okelo oyito gat olxrbe
A. O. 3s-climb-perf mountain 3s-follow-perf-3s
Alaba, Okelo climbed the mountain, he followed her
'Alaba, Okelo climbed the mountain toward her'
Clefted NP's may also cross clause boundaries:
(1) ogwai) enn äme äwipö ni alabä äköbbö ni öcwe. it rel+part ls-hear-perf comp A. 3s-say-prog comp
3s-become+fat-perf
'it's Ogwang that I heard Alaba was saying was fat'
Cleft is subject to the CNPC and the CSC. Analogous to the situation in
relativization, NP's in the second clause of a paratactic construction cannot be clefted to the beginning of the sentence:
(2) *ogwarj
ante adiö okelo ojwate
O. it rel + part ls-press-perf O. 3s-hit-perf-3s
'it's Ogwang that I forced Okelo to hit'
A noun in the first clause can, however, be clefted:
vvxv' 1 *· ^
^ j ^ ^.
·
^ j.
^
(/ \) okelo
enn ame adio
ojwato
ogwaq
O. it rel+part ls-press-perf 3s-hit perf O.
it's Okelo that I pressed, he hit Ogwang
'it's Okelo that I forced to hit Ogwang'Nouns in the second clause of a serial construction can, however, be
clefted:
(4)rwotame okelo ocwe kateking it rel+part O. 3s-become + fat-perf 3s-surpass-hab
'it's the king that Okelo is fatter than'
The reason for the different restrictions on topicalization and clefting in paratactic constructions (topicalization, but not clefting is possible out of the second clause) has to do, it would seem, with the
respective functions of topicalization and cleft. Topicalization establishes a sentence orientation; what follows the orientation is typically
new information. A clefted NP is an item-in-contrast; what follows theEmbedded cleft and topic constructions239clefted NP is necessarily old information. If an NP like ogwag in (2) is
an item-in-contrast, the Lango strategy seems to be to note as background material only the second clause. For instance, one would say,
/f \(5)v^'^A S I X ^ X V *v.*ogwarj enn ame okelo ojwateO. it rel+part O. 3s-hit-perf-3s
'it's Ogwang that Okelo hit'
instead of (2). The first clause in (2) is, presumably, background and redundant; the second clause alone is sufficient to identify the situation and the
referent. But with topicalization, the fact that both clauses are being asserted as new information makes their presence mandatory if the meaning they contain is to be communicated. So topicalization is allowable
under these conditions, but cleft is not. Since there is no problem embedding serial constructions, which contain a single assertion like ordinary,
non-coordinate, complex sentences, clefting NP's in the second clause is
permissible.
9.9.2 Topic and cleft within embedded clausesTopicalization may apply within an embedded clause, fronting an N P to
the beginning ofthat clause:
(1) rwot neo ni ogwag okelo dägöking 3s-know-hab comp O. O. 3s-hate-hab
'the king knows that Ogwang is hated by Okelo'
All types of true embedded clauses can have topics distinct from subjects
(topics underlined):
(2) otoka ante rwot okelo omiocar rel+part king O. 3s-give-perf
'the car that the king was given by Okelo'
(3) i kare rwot okelo owille, te dokin time king O. 3s-buy-ben-perf-3s, 3s-and+then-hab
go+back-infin
'when Okelo bought it for the king, he went back'
Topicalization is not possible within infinitive phrases, nor is it possible
within the second clause of a paratactic or serial construction:
(4)""'rwot ödio loca dako opömöking 3s-press-perf man woman 3s-marry-perf
the king pressed the man, the woman he married
'the king forced the man to marry the woman'
As usual, clefting is more restricted than topicalization. It can apply
within certain types of embedded clauses, e.g. complements to prepositional240The syntax of complex sentencesattitude predicates and predicates of knowledge, as well as utterance
predicates:135
(1) όρίό okobo ni okelo έηη ame* otogo magO. 3s-say-perf comp O. it rel+part 3s-cut-perf cane
Opio said that it's Okelo that cut the cane'
(2)rwot tamo ni okelo έηη ami okwalo gwenoking 3s-think-hab comp O. it rel+part 3s-steal-perf
chicken
'the king thinks that it's Okelo that stole the chicken'
(3)ge ni icok έηη ame rwot ocamols-know-hab comp potato it rel+part king 3s-eat-perf
Ί know that it's the potato that the king ate'
Cleft is difficult or impossible elsewhere, e.g. in complements to desiderative predicates,
(1) *amxtto ni okelo έηη ante kw l gwenols-want-prog comp O. it rel+part 3s-steal-subj chicken
Ί want that it's Okelo that steal chicken'
or in relative clauses:
(2)*gweno ame okelo en ame okwalochicken re-part O. it rel+part 3s-steal-perf
'the chicken that it's Okelo that stole'9.10 Subjects and topics
In the section above, some coreference properties were described as
though they were properties of subjects. On closer examination, these
properties turn out to be properties of topics, and it is only because subjects are likely to be topics that these coreference properties could informally be attributed to them. 136
The first of these is control of switch reference. As described in Sec.
9.3.2, the switch/non-switch reference morphology is used in hypotactic
complements to indicate whether the subject of the subordinate clause is
the same or different than the subject of the main clause:
( 1 ) d k okobbi loca ni ebino dokwoman 3s-say-ben-perf man comp 3s-come-hab
go+back-infin
'the womani told the man that shei will go back'
i=iSubjects and topics241(2) däko okobbx loca ni binö d5kwoman 3s-say-ben-perf man comp 3s-come-hab
go+back-infm
'the womani told the man that shej will go back'i*j
In fact, topics, not subjects, preferentially control switch reference morphology, as the following examples show:
(1) loca däkö okobbe ni ebino dokman woman 3s-say-ben-perf-3s comp 3s-come-hab
go-fback-infin
'the mani was told by the woman that hei will go back'
(2) loca däkö okobbe ni binö dokman woman 3s-say-ben-perf-3s comp 3s-come-hab
go+back-infm
'the mani was told by the woman that he/shej will go back'
The qualification 'preferentially' is necessary since if the topicalized NP
cannot be interpreted as coreferential with switch/non-switch morphology
(e.g. if it is first or second person), the subject can control coreference:
(3) an ökelö ökobbä ni ebino dokI O. 3s-say-ben-perf-ls comp 3s-come-hab
go+back-infin
was told by Okeloi that hei will go back'
(4) an ökelö ökobbä ni binö dokI O. 3s-say-ben-perf-ls comp 3s-come-hab
go+back-infin
was told by Okeloi that hej will go back'
The second is control of coreference with floated quatifiers (Sec. 8.7.8).
This is also a property of topics, and a topicalized NP will be interpreted
as coreferential with a floated quantifier preferentially over the subject:
(1) mon oöl kede gwoggi ducuwomen 3s-be + tired-hab with dogs all
'the women are tired of all the dogs'
(2) gwoggi ducu mon ool kedgidogs all women 3s-be + tired-hab with-3p
'all the dogs, the women are tired of them'
(3) gwoggi mon ool ducu kedgidogs women 3s-be+tired-hab all with-3p
'all the dogs, the women are tired of them'
Again, if the topic cannot be interpreted as coreferential with the quantifier (e.g. if it is unquantifiable, or morphologically singular), then the242The syntax of complex sentencessubject controls coreference:
(4) an mon ool ducu kedaI women 3s-be+tired-hab all with-Is
'me, all the women are tired of9.11 Negative NP's
Lango has no negative indefinite proforms like 'nothing', 'nowhere', etc.,
nor does it have a negative article like'no' as in 'no book*. In place of these,
Lango uses a complex construction with pe 'to not exist':
(1) atinn äme öwotö gülu pechild rel + part 3s-go-perf G. 3s-not+exist-hab
'no child has gone to Gulu'
(2)ginnoro am« äcämo pething-indef rel+part ls-eat-perf 3s-not+exist-hab
ate nothing*
(3)rjattoro äme ocämo dekko peperson-indef rel+part 3s-eat-perf stew-that
3s-not+exist-hab
'no one ate that stew'9.12 Expression of adverbial notions
9.12.1 Time and circumstanceCircumstantial expressions can be found either with a paratactic construction,
( 1 ) ädok cen anworjo ätinls-go+back-perf back ls-find-perf child
'when I got back, I found the child'
or with a relative construction with kare 'time' as head:
(2) i kare äme ädok cen, änworjö ätinin time rel+part ls-go-back-perf, ls-find-perf child
'when I got back, I found the child'
Expression of time before, time after, and simultaneity are found with
an otherwise unattested relative construction. Here, the time expressionExpression of adverbial notions243follows the main clause and is preceded by a relative particle ame. ame,
however, is not preceded by a relative head — this is the only instance of
a headless relative in Lango. In expressing time after, the verb in the ame
clause is inflected in the perfective aspect:
(1) däkö olwokere ame ocemowoman 3s-wash-mid-perf rel+part 3s-eat-perf
'the woman washed after she ate'
Simultaneity is expressed with the verb in the progressive aspect:
(2)icS ocemo ame ämätto k5goman 3s-eat-perf rel+part 3s-drink-prog beer
'the man ate while drinking beer'
In expressing time before, the ame clause is negated and the negative particle is followed by ru·, 'ever, yet':
(3) däkö ocemo ame pe nur olwokerewoman 3s-eat-perf rel + part neg yet 3s-wash-mid-perf
'the woman ate before she washed'
This construction may be preposed, but when it is, ame may not be present:
(4) däkö pe ru· olwokere, ocemo
woman neg yet 3s-wash-mid-perf, 3s-eat-perf
'before the woman washed, she ate'
Simultaneity can also be indicated with a paratactic construction. The
verbs are repeated and are usually found in the habitual aspect:
( 1 ) loce cemö moto cemö matöman 3s-eat-hab 3s-drink-hab 3s-eat-hab 3s-drink hab
'the man ate and drank'
It may also be indicated by adjacent sentences in discourse where one sentence, typically the second, is expressed in the progressive aspect:
(2)loca ocamo rirjo. amatto korpman 3s-eat-perf meat. 3s-drink-prog beer
'the man ate meat, he was drinking beer'
Temporal sequencing is discussed further in Sec. 10.2
9.12.2 CauseEfficient cause can either be expressed via parataxis,
(1) äryekäkwänöls-wise-hab ls-read-hab
'I'm wise because I read'244The syntax of complex sentencesor by means of a subordinate clause with pi en 'because of it' acting as a
subordinating conjunction:
(2) aryek pi en äkwänö
ls-wise-hab because+of it ls-read-hab
'I'm wise because I read'
Notice that pire is the usual third person singular form of pi 'because of.
kit 'way, manner' at the head of a relative clause can, in addition to its use
in expressing manner (Sec. 9.12.6), be used to express cause:
(3) öwöt öyep cem kit ame totowa pe
ld-go-subj Id-look+for-subj food way rel+part
mother-1 pa 3s-be+present-hab
'let's go and look for food since our mothers aren't here'9.12.3 Sufficiency
Statements of sufficiency or insufficiency are formed with paratactic constructions with Tr rommo, AN rom 'to be sufficient' or Tr remmo, AN rein
'to be insufficient' as the second verb in the series:
( 1 ) en omiyä dek oroma
he 3s-give-perf-ls stew 3s-be+sufficient-perf-ls
'he gave me enough stew'
omiya dek re ma
he 3s-give-perf-ls stew 3s-be + insufficient-perf-ls
'he didn't give me enough stew'
*S ___ A*J V *VV _*Since the paratactic construction requires that the subject of the second
clause be an argument of the first, activities can not be modified in this
way. When stating that an activity or action is sufficient or insufficient,
the verb must be nominalized and made the subject of romma or remmo:
(3) kwanere orame
read-infin-3sa 3s-be+sufficient-hab-3s
'he reads enough'9.12.4 Purpose
Purpose expressions are formed with the preposition me followed by either
infinitives or gerunds. An infinitive is used unless a noun coreferential to
the object of the verb in the purpose expression immediately precedes the
purpose expression, in which case the gerund is used:Expression of adverbial notions245( 1 ) loca obino me canuno gwenoman 3s-come-perf for eat-infin chicken
'the man came to eat chicken'
(2) däkö omäkö gweno me äcämäwoman 3s-catch-perf chicken for eat-ger-lsa
'the woman caught a chicken for me to eat'
(3) däkö omäkö gweno me äcamänäwoman 3s-catch-perf chicken for eat-ger-lsa
'the woman caught a chicken for me to eat'
Gerunds can be interpreted as nominal modifiers, infinitives as adverbials.
Notice, however, that gerunds generally do not topicalize along with their
heads:
(4)gweno dakö omäkö me äcamänächicken woman 3s-catch-perf for eat-ger-lsa
'the chicken, the woman caught it for me to eat'
With infinitives only, me may be deleted:
(5) kwäc olwrite i burj dwogo nekko tott a äpwöL. 3s-sneak-mid-perf out forest come+back infin
kill-infin mother att+part H.
'leopard sneaked out of the forest to come back to kill
Hare's mother'
9.12.5 Consequence and resultStatements about consequence and result are often made with the paratactic construction. In these cases, the second clause is interpreted as the
result or consequence of the first:
(1) acemo tütwäl äcwels-eat-hab very-much ls-become + fat-perf
I eat a lot, I'm fat
eat a lot so I'm fat'
(2) omätö kdrp omer3s-drink-perf beer 3s-become-l-drunk-perf
he drank beer, he got drunk
'he drank beer so he's drunk*
They may also be made with the relative particle ante followed by a verb
in the perfective aspect:246The syntax of complex sentences(3) o!5ko lok ami yie am£ ödök
3s-change-perf word rel+part in belly-3sa rel+part
3s-go+back-perf
'he changed his mind and (as a result) went back'
The first ams functions as the ordinary relative particle. The resultative
sense of the second ante probably results from a pragmatic inference from
the more basic 'time after' sense (Sec. 9.12.1).
9.12.6 Manner

10.1 Reference in discourse
The relations of an NP to other NP's in a discourse may be signalled by
the type of anaphoric process used. For subjects, there is a four member
system of oppositions for the representation of NP's:
full NP
(1) loca ocem
man 3s-eat-perf
'the man ate'
reinforced subject
(2) έη loca ocem
he man 3s-eat-perf
'the man ate'
independent pronoun
/ο \(J)'
*·
·*
εη
ocemhe 3s-eat-perf
'he ate'
inflected verb
(4) ocem
3s-eat-perf
'he ate'
In the case of human DO's and advanced lO's, there is a five way opposition:
full NP
(1) aneno loca
ls-see-perf man
Ί saw the man'
topicalized DO
(2) loca ϋηέηέ

'the man was seen by me'

Introducing a referentReferents in Lango are introduced to discourses by the unsurprising device
of using full NP's, unless the referent is both known and in the forefront of
attention of both speaker and hearer, in which case inflected verbs are likely
to be used. Notice that reference to speaker and hearer (first and second person referents, respectively) are by definition known and in the forefront of
attention, and so full NP's are not used. When the addressee is not certain, as
in the case of a person shouting into a crowd, a vocative NP may be used, inReference in discourse249addition to the usual second person reference. Vocatives precede the sentence,
occasionally follow it, most often as afterthoughts:
(1) okelo, bin känO. 2s-come-imper here
Okelo, come here'
In regard to introduced third person referents not in the forefront of
attention of both speaker and hearer, their syntactic placement depends
on their status as topics, or sentence orientations. Referents intended as
discourse topics are introduced as subjects. If further identification is
necessary, this is accomplished by introducing the referent as the subject
of an indentification sentence:
( 1 ) ogwäg äwobi arne papperc rwot
O. boy rel + part father-3sa king
Ogwang is a boy whose father is a king'New referents, which are not discourse topics are typically introduced as
objects:
(2) okelo ödök päco. onworjo tottereO. 3s-go+back-perf home. 3s-find-perf mother-3sa
Okelo went back home. He found his mother'
In (2), toto 'mother' is introduced into the discourse. New referents intended as main characters in a narrative may be introduced like discourse
topics.
Since Lango organizes its sentences along an old-new continuum, new
referents that are unknown to the hearer (i.e. indefinites) must be introduced towartd the end of the sentence. The only exceptions are nouns
marked with -morS, which marks indefinites (Sec. 8.7.4). Nouns so marked
may occupy subject position, and since the subject is an obligatory constituent of a Lango sentence, some sentence types, for instance existentials, virtually require subjects marked with -moro.
Established referentsA referent is said to be established if it is in the hearer's immediate consciousness, which in discourse terms usually means that it has been mentioned within the last three or four sentences with no other referents
mentioned with which it may be confused. In such cases, the inflected verb
is used or, for non-humans, zero anaphora, which is functionally
equivalent to the inflected verb in Lango:
(1) ojuk obinö päcoO. 3s-come-perf home250Structures in discourse
(2) te teddo rino3s-and+then-hab cook-infin meat
(3) te cämmo3s-and+then-hab eat-infin
Ojuk came home. He then cooked the meat and ate it'
Established referents may also be coded as DO's, retaining topic status. In
such cases, the inflected verb will not suffice, and a topicalized pronoun
is used. For instance, the discourse above could be followed by a sentence
like
(4)en j5te nennehim people 3s-and+then-hab see-infin-3s
'he was then seen by the people'
where the topic Ojuk is referenced by the pronoun
and the third singular object marking on the infinitive.
Established referents may shift from topic to non-topic status, as in
the case of Okelo in the discourse below. As a non-topic direct object,
Okelo in (4) is referenced by the inflected verb:
( 1 ) okelo obedo pipO. 3s-sit-per ground
(2) teyää3s-and + then-hab go-infin
(3) te wot okko3s-and+then-hab go-infin completely
(4) ogwäg te nenne. 3s-and+then-hab see-infin-3s
Okelo sat on the ground. He then got up and went
away. Then Ogwang saw him'
Reestablished referentsWhen a referent has been a topic and then loses topic status to another
referent, as in the case of Okelo in (4) in the above discourse, several
devices are available for reestablishing the referent as topic. Suppose sentence (5) continues the above discourse and reestablishes Okelo as topic.
This may be done by simply using a full NP,
(5)okelo te rirjoO. 3s-and+then-hab run-infin
Okelo then ran'
or by using an independent pronoun:Reference in discourse251(5') έη te rirjohe es-and+then-hab run-infin
'he then ran'
The independent pronouns en and gin 'they' in subject position signal a
reestablish topic, or in some cases the beginning of a new episode (Sec.
10.2).137
But suppose that sentence (4) above is followed by a number of sentences with Ogwang as topic. In reestablishing Okelo as topic, either the
full NP is used (as in (5) above), or the reinforced subject is used:
(6) έη okelo te rirjo
he O. 3s-and+then-hab run-infin
Okelo then ran'
The sole function of the reinforced subject seems to be to reestablish as
topic a referent that has not been topic for at least three or four sentences. The thematic suffix -mere can also be used in such cases:
(6') okelomere te rirjo
O.-theme 3s-and+then-hab run-infin
'then the aforementioned Okelo ran'
Where required by the valence scheme, NP's may be reesatablished as
topics syntactically as DO's. They will take the form of topicalized NP's:
(7) okelo ja owijie wot i burj
O. people 3s-hear-perf-3s 3s-walk-prog in forest
Okelo was heard walking in the forest'
Notice the use of jo 'people' as a non-specific subject.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"
"(2)atin öyucü ödilö pip
child 3s-throw-perf ball ground
'the child threw the ball down'180The syntax of simple sentences(3)däko odopo 5ko
woman 3s-go+out-perf out
'the woman went out'Two directional phrases can occur together:
(4)ädok paco i yuganda
ls-go+back-perf home to U.
went back home to Uganda'Ventive verbs (Sec. 8.2.3) code direction toward the speaker:
(1)rwot ocwallo lyec
king 3s-send-ven-perf elephant
'the king sent the elephant in my direction'8.11.3 Accompaniment
Accompaniment is indicated by prepositional phrases with i, or when greater
clarity is desirable (since the meaning of i is only that some relation exists
between its object and the predicate), with kede, ke, or ginni 'with':
(1)loca obino< x
vdäkö
\ kede /man 3s-come-perf with woman
'the man came with the woman'
(2)rwöt ocwalo däko i wärägä
king 3s-send-perf woman with letter
'the king sent the woman with the letter'(3)äpwö obinö rwätte ginni kwäc
H. 3s-come-perf meet-mid-infin with L.
'Hare came to meet with Leopard'Accompaniment and NP conjunction are indicated by the same
prepositions. But the essential difference between them in sentences
like the following,
(1)atin kede gwok odäkchild with dog 3s-go+back-perf
'the child and the dog went back'
(2)atin odök kede gwok
child 3s-go+back-perf with dog
'the child went back with the dog'is the thematic status of the object of kede. If gwok 'dog' is a joint topic
with atin 'child', then (1) would be used; otherwise (2) is used. (2) could
also receive the gloss 'the child went back with a dog', but the gloss 'theExpression of adverbial notions181child and a dog went back' is not available for (1). That meaning would
have to be rendered by (2), or by (3):
(3)ätin kede gwok'koro odak
child with dog-indef 3s-go+back-perf
'the child and a dog went back'Nouns in preverbal position are interpreted as definite unless made indefinite with the indefinite suffix.
8.11.4 Manner and degree
There are two common ways to form manner expressions. The first involves adjectives (always in their singular forms) and the atrributive particle
ä. They may be reduplicated (as in (1) and (2)) and always follow the verb
they modify:
(1}kom ätin tie ädok a beber
body child 3s-be+present-hab 3s-go+back-prog
att-f part good
'the child is becoming well'(2)loca otiyo a cecek
man 3s-work-perf att+part short
'the man worked briefly'(3)ajwate ä tek
ls-hit-perf-3s att+part hard
hit him hard'There is no difference, then, in the form of adjectives used adverbially
and their form as modifiers of nouns. The attributive particle is used for
both; they both follow the forms they modify.
The second method involves 'descriptive adverbs'. Descriptive adverbs
are always preceded by the particle ni. Unlike the adjectives described
above, which can be used attributively, predicatively, and adverbially,
descriptive adverbs never have another grammatical function. Further,
they appear to be lexically isolated in the sense that they are not derivatively related to nouns, verbs or adjectives. There are a large number of
descriptive adverbs, and they are frequently encountered:
(1)obedo ni Iwaje3s-sit-perf part clumsily
'she sat clumsily'
(2)pämo cem ni mw»k-mw»k
3s-chew-hab food part noisily
'he chews food noisily'182The syntax of simple sentences(3)kome my el ni beg-beg
body-3sa 3s-shake-hab part with-embarrassment
'he shakes with embarrassment'(4)opoto i pi ni cabul
3s-drop-perf in water part with+a+plop
'he dropped it in the water with a plop'(5)odxlo böno ni gig
3s-pack-perf clothes part full
'she packed the clothes to the rim'Some descriptive adverbs appear to be onomatopoeic (e.g. mwak-mwak
'noisily'). The vowel , otherwise rather rare in Lango, frequently occurs in these words. Notice that their manner of reduplication is different from the CiV- reduplication of adjectives, resembling instead
reduplicated nouns, the forms given as reduplicated always appear in
that form.
Descriptive adverbs often occur with bedo 'to sit, stay' as their main
verb, in which case they may translate English predicate adjectives:
(1)obedonigog
3s-sit-perf part thin
'he was thin, emaciated'(2)ädwög obedo ni gog
old-person 3s-sit-perf part stiff
'the old one was stiff, dried up'They cannot, however, function as predicate adjectives without bedo, unlike true adjectives.
Prepositional phrases can also be used to express manner in simplex
sentences, but they are of much less frequency in this role than the two
constructions discussed above. An example:(1)yin itimö kede kumu
you 2s-do-perf with grief
'you did it with a grieving manner'The manner preforms are amanno and amanni, which consist of the
attributive particle a, the demonstrative proform man 'this', and the
demonstrative suffixes -no 'that' and -ni 'this':
(1)ja ducu temö amänno
people all 3s-try-hab like+that
'all people try like that'The p r i m a r y degree adverb is tutwal. It can modify verbs or other
adverbs:Expression of adverbial notions1l)ämarö entebbe tütwäl
ls-like-hab E. very+much
like Entebbe very much'(2)ade änwoggo tek tütwäl
ls-be+present-hab ls-find-prog hard very
'I'm finding it very hard'(3)an kec anekkä tütwäl
I hunger 3s-kill-perf-ls very
Tm really hungry'183Another common degree expression is pe tweeri, the negative particle and
the third singular middle habitual of tweero 'to be able'. It translates the
English 'very much, really' and is used only to modify actions:
(1)atin akok a pe tweere
child 3s-cry-prog att+part neg 3s-be+able-mid-hab
'the child is really crying'Gerunds can also translate English degree expressions:
(1)(2)yo bor
way 3s-long-hab
'the way is long'
yo bor äboräway 3s-long-hab long-ger
'the way is really long'
Similarly, reduplicated adjectives have the sense of a degree expression:
(3)yo boborway 3s-long-hab
'the way is pretty long'
Other degree expressions are formed by complex constructions with
verbs such as rem 'to be insufficient' (Sec. 9.9.3).
8.11.5 Probability
Probability judgements are frequently made via matrix verbs in complex
sentences. However, a number of adverbials are used for this purpose too:
(1)ico okwalo gwenö äteni
man 3s-steal-perf chicken certainly
'certainly, the man stole the chicken'(2)bind turn gite3s-come-hab be + finished-infin for+sure
'it'll be finished for sure'184The syntax of simple sentences(3)kom malaria on ru loca
certainly malaria 3s-make+drowsy-perf man
'certainly, malaria made the man drowsy'(4)d k όρο ot rjo
woman 3s-be+possible-perf 3s-chop-perf sugarcane
'maybe the woman chopped sugarcane'These adverbs come first or last in their clause, except for όρο Or,
maybe, it is possible', which normally comes immediately before the
verb, but may come sentence-initially. Its syntax is very like that of
onwogo (Sec. 8.2.4), and like onwoqo it is morphologically a third person singular perfective verb, remaining third person singular regardless of the person or number of the subject, όρο in this sense is often
accompanied by kono 'if (Sec. 9.7):
(l)kono όρο wot
wot
if 3s-be+possible-perf 3s-go-perf
'maybe he's walking'8.11.6 Commitment or completeness
One adverb of frequent occurence is okko, whose function is to indicate
that the action or state described is irrevocable and complete, or that the
subject has committed himself to it completely:
(1)abi no yaa okkols-come-hab go-infin completely
Ί will go away'
(2)d k oc mo okko
woman 3s-eat-perf completely
'the woman ate it up'(3)tin owoto okko i bot rwot
child 3s-walk-perf completely at to king
'the child walked after the king'okko invariably occurs with a verb in the perfective aspect (or at least one
interpreted as perfective as with verbs in the te construction, Sec. 9.6,
10.2). It usually comes last in the sentence, but may precede other adverbials. okko almost always accompanies certain verbs, e.g. nekko 'to kill'
and t
'to die', whose actions or states are intrinsically irrevocable and
complete:
(1)adworj otoo okko
old + person 3s-die-perf completely
'the old one died'Expression of adverbial notions(2)185a wöbe önekö two l ökko
boy 3s-kill-perf snake completely
'the boy killed the snake'8.11.7 Time
Time adverbials may be simple adverbs or prepositional phrases.
These time adverbials always occur at the beginning or end of the
sentence:
(1)an äbinö yekkö kal diki
I ls-come-hab sieve-infin millet tomorrow
'I'll sieve the millet tomorrow'(2)i dikkomere gin oyaa
in morning-theme they 3p-go-perf
'in the morning they went'(3)onwono ineo can
3s-find-perf 2s-know-hab long-ago
'you knew it long ago'(4)okx/po bür näka-naka

is to say it follows the first stressed word:
(1)icamo rur rigo?
2s-eat-perf ever meat
'have you ever eaten meat?'","[195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"

Lango is a member of the Lwo subgroup of Western Nilotic, a branch of
the Nilotic languages, which in turn are members of the Nilo-Saharan
family (Greenberg 1966). Nilo-Saharan as a whole is a rather poorly
studied group despite the fact that the languages are distributed over a
large area in the Eastern Sahel and East Africa.
Lango is spoken entirely within Uganda. The population is located
primarily in Lango province, north of Lake Kyoga in central Uganda.
Lango is most closely allied, both in grammar and lexicon, to Acholi, and
somewhat more distantly to Luo and Alur. Tucker (1957) and Tucker and
Bryan (1966) have asserted that the Langi originally spoke an Eastern
Nilotic language and, since moving to their present habitat, have taken
up a form of Western Nilotic (but compare Driberg (1923) on this point).
Numerous apparent relics, both syntactical and lexical, can be found which
may attest to this earlier linguistic affiliation, though the evidence needs
to be very carefully assessed to determine whether these are relics or some
sort of adstratum.
The Lango language which is the subject of this study is distinct from
that of two groups of people living in the Sudan who are sometimes also
referred to as 'Lango.' One of these speaks an eastern Nilotic language
closely related to Lotuko; the other, usually referred to as Didinga, speaks
a Surma language.
In recent years, the Langi have been a politically important group
within Uganda. During the period of the Amin regime and the civil war
that followed, the Langi people suffered greatly and many were killed or
went into exile. Estimates of the number of Langi vary from 300,000
(Okello, 1975) to 823,200 (Grimes, 1988). Many Langi have some
knowledge of English.
There is very little published work on Lango. The earliest and most
useful work is Driberg (1923) which contains a short grammar and a dictionary. While this is a most valuable work, it is seriously flawed in a number of crucial areas. Driberg discusses syntax only incidentally and
sparsely in the course of his treatment of morphology and, in addition,
tends to over-morphologize, i.e. to represent in single words sequences
of independent (and separable) words. The tone system of Lango is almost completely ignored. In his transcription of vowels, Driberg fails to
note the distinctions based on advanced versus retracted tongue root,
thereby cutting the vowel inventory in half. The effects of this transcriptional inadequacy extend beyond mere failure to note phonological
processes such as vowel harmony, and differences between lexical items.
For example, Driberg fails to recognize grammatical categories such as2Introductionthe aspect distinctions in the verbal paradigms, which are frequently distinguished only by tone.
Tucker and Bryan (1966) provide the only other grammatical information, presenting a few features of Lango grammar in a chapter giving
a general overview of Western Nilotic. Also in a comparative vein is Blount
and Curley (1970) which compares Lango vocabulary, in the form of
Swadesh's 100 and 200 word lists, with other closely related Western
Nilotic languages.
Other literature on Lango is concerned with specific aspects of Lango
phonology and syntax. Tucker (1958) is a valuable discussion of segmental and tonemic phenomena at word boundaries. Maddieson, Shopen and
Okello (1974), Clifton (1975), and Dwyer (1983) discuss Lango tonemics,
while Okello (1975) discusses both tonemic and segmental phonology. The
last four works are written in a generative framework. Dwyer (1983) and
Bavin (1982) compare Lango with Southern Lwo kin.
Brief mention of Lango is also made in the following works: Tucker
(1955), Hall et al (1955), and Greenberg (1966).
Newspapers, pedagogical materials, and some literary works have
been published in Lango. A complete translation of the Bible has been
available since 1979. There are also radio broadcasts in the language. Personal correspondence between Langi, however, is likely to be in English,
the language of schools, higher literacy, and the courts in Uganda.
The primary material upon which this work is based was collected over
a period of several years, from 1977 to 1983, from consultants residing in
Buffalo, New York, and Los Angeles. A number of Lango speakers served
as consultants, chief among them were Mary Okello, Jonas Opio, Florence
Monday, and George Ojuk. To all of them I express my gratitude. In addition to data collected from consultants, textual material collected by
Driberg (1923) was also used, as were short stories written by Langi.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Wally Chafe, Bob
Kirsner, Paul Schachter, and Sandy Thompson for helpful comments at
various stages in the production of this work. I would like to give special
thanks first to Chet Creider, whose detailed comments greatly improved
the work, and second, but most importantly, to Edith Bavin, with whom
much of the data were collected and with whom I worked out the preliminary analysis of the grammar.
And lastly, I would like to thank Dean Andrade, who designed and
typed the final camera-ready version.","[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"9.1.3 Parataxis
Parataxis, technically asyndetic parataxis, is very frequently encountered
in Lango.
It involves the juxtaposition of two clauses forming a single
sentence without any marker of subordination or coordination specifying
the relation between the two clauses. Some examples:
complementation

In the following sections, I will discuss the morphological, syntactic,
and semantic characteristics of parataxis in Lango. I will try to relate the
distribution of paratactic constructions to the general meaning of
parataxis in the language. 1
9.1.3.1 General characteristics of paratactic constructionsIn this section, I will discuss some general characteristics of paratactic constructions. In particular, I will show that paratactic constructions are single
sentences consisting of two (or more) syntactically independent though
parallel clauses forming a single phonological unit. The second clause cannot have an overt nominal subject and no marker of subordination or coordination links the two clauses.
The phonological status of paratactic constructions as single sentences
is shown first of all by the fact that paratactic constructions form intonational units like simple sentences and not like compound sentences. In the196The syntax of complex sentencescase of true conjoined sentences, for instance those conjoined with
'but, as for', there is a pause before the conjunction and each conjunct exhibits a left-to-right falling intonation contour (cf Sec. 9.1.2). Paratactic
constructions, like simple sentences, exhibit a single left-to-right falling intonation contour with no characteristic pause at the clause boundary. In
this way, paratactic constructions differ from other sorts of juxtaposed
clauses in Lango and other languages, where the intonation pattern reveals
a division into two clauses. The English juxtapsed construction,
(1) it's not cheap, it's expensive
exhibits this pattern while
(2) go tell your brother to come in
is the English counterpart of the Lango paratactic construction. Downdrift,
as well as downstep, phenomena in Lango operate in the normal way across
clause boundaries in paratactic constructions. For example, the word däkö
'woman' conditions downstep on any high tone following it, as in:
(1)dako kedo akeddi -^ [däxo_^kedo äked'i]
woman 3s-braid-hab grass
'the woman braids grass'dakö also conditions downstep across clause boundaries in parataxis:
(2)ätin önwörjö dxö däkö tedde dek —>
[ätin önwörjö dio däxo_^t£d«e dek]
child 3s-find-perf 3s-press-hab woman 3s-cook-ben-hab
3s-stew
the child used to press the woman, she used to cook
for him
'the child used to force the woman to cook for him'In true coordinate constructions, the conjunction begins a new intonation contour and can not register downstep. Similarly, other rules of
external sandhi such as those converting /k/ to [x] and /t/ to [ ] (a voiceless tap) operate across clause boundaries in parataxis, so that the word
final /k/ in gwök 'dog' in
(3)äwipo gwök ogweols-hear-perf dog 3s-bark-perf
I heard the dog, it barked
heard the dog bark'
is pronounced [x], whereas in sentence final position, even when followed
by a conjunction, as in
(4) awijio gwök, ento pe aneno
ls-hear-perf dog, but neg ls-see-perf
heard the dog, but I didn't see it'Introduction197it is pronounced as a velar stop.
Each clause in the paratactic construction contains a fully inflected
verb so that each clause could stand by itself as an independent sentence,
as indicated by the glosses provided for paratactic constructions. The
verbs need not agree in aspect. 8 Each clause may be independently
negated.
Only the first verb in the series can have an overt nominal
or pronominal subject; any verbs following the first are inflected for subject agreement but have as their subject some referent that is either subject or object of the first clause in the series. In the case of sentences like
(1) loca odio atin okwano bukman 3s-press-perf child 3s-read-perf book
the man pressed the child, he read the book
'the man forced the child to read the book'
the noun atin 'child' is notionally the direct object of the first verb odio
'pressed' and the subject of the second verb okwano 'read', but syntactically, it functions only as the object of odio. There is one simple demonstration of the syntactic status of atin in (1). When atin is pronominalized, the
verb odio is inflected for third singular object, as in (2):
(2) loc» odie okwano bukman 3s-press-perf-3s 3s-read-perf book
the man pressed him, he read the book
'the man forced him to read the book'
Pronominalized direct objects in Lango appear as object affixes as in (2)
(Sec. 8.2.5), but pronominalized subjects can either be non-overt, appearing only as inflections on the verb or can appear as a subject pronoun accompanied by the subject agreement inflection. If atin in (1) is
pronominalized by either of the techniques available for subjects, the
result is ungrammatical:
(3) *loc» odio okwano bukman 3s-press-perf 3s-read-perf book
'the man forced him to read the book ""
(4)*loc» odio en okwano bukman 3s-press-perf he 3s-read-perf book
'the man forced him to read the book'
(5) *loca die en okwano bukman 3s-press-perf-3s he 3s-read-perf book
'the man forced him to read the book'
It might be maintained, however, that (2) is simply some sort of phonological
reduction of (4). There are good semantic reasons why this could not be the
case given the respective functions of έη and the paratactic construction, as198The syntax of complex sentenceswill become evident in what follows, but an additional problem with this
analysis involves the tone on the second verb. When a third person singular
perfective verb in Lango has an overt pronomial subject, as in
(6) en okwano buk
he 3s-read-perf book
'he read the book'
the verb assumes the relative clause tonal pattern (Sec. 8.2.5, 9.2) of lowhigh-low, the same as we find in the relative construction in
(7) Ioc9 okwano buk
man 3s-read-perf book
'the man who read the book'
When the verb has no overt subject or when the subject is a noun, the tonal
pattern in the perfective is low-low-low, as in
(8)okwano buk3s-read-perf book
'he read the book'
(9) loca okwano buk
man 3s-read-perf book
'the man read the book'
This tone alternation is a grammatically conditioned feature, and is not a
matter of tone sandhi. If (2) did in fact arise through phonological reduction of some construction like (4), where en was the subject of okwano,
then we would expect the second verb in (2) to have the relative tone. This
relative tone can occur in subordinate clauses when the pronoun
is subject, as in
(10) ätämö ni en omato korp
ls-think-perf comp he 3s-drink-perf beer
thought that he drank beer'
We do not find relative tone on okwano in (2), even as an option. Note
also that when the subject of the first verb in
( 1 ) loca odio ätin okwano buk
man 3s-press-perf child 3s-read-perf book
the man pressed the child, he read the book
'the man forced the child to read the book'
is relativized, as in
(2) loca ame odio ätin okwano buk
man rel + part 3s-press-perf child 3s-read-perf book
'the man that forced the child to read the book'
the relative tone appears on the first verb. But if ätin 'child' is relativizedIntroduction199on, the relative tone does not appear on the second verb:
(3) ätinn äme l ocä ödio okwano buk
child rel-i-part man 3s-press-perf 3s-read-perf book
'the child that the man forced to read the book'
But the relative tone may appear in subordinate clauses:
(4)ätinn äme loca ötamo ni okwano bukchild rel+part man 3s-think-perf comp 3s-read-perf book
'the child that the man thought read the book'
This, then, constitutes additional proof that ätin in (1) is not the grammatical subject of the second verb in the series.
Another indication of the syntactic status of paratactic constructions
comes from a comparison of paratactic complements with hypotactic complements. A hypotactic complement is a subordinate clause, whereas a
paratactic complement is not. With hypotactic complements, both indicative and subjunctive, a verb inflected for third person must have a prefix
indicating whether the subject of the subordinate clause is the same or different from the subject of the main clause. In the third person singular perfective, the prefix indicating same subject (non-switch reference) is -, and
the prefix indicating different subject (switch reference) is o-. These forms
are illustrated below:
non-switch reference(1) rwot opoyo ni ecego dogola
king 3s-remember-perf comp 3s-close-perf door
'the kingi remembered that hei closed the door'
switch reference(2) rwot opoyo ni ocego dagola
'the kingi remembered that he/shej closed the door'i*j
In (1), the subject of ecegö must be interpreted as rwot 'king', while in (2)
the subject ofocegö must be interpreted as being someone other than the
king. This is available only in subordinate clauses. Since the switch
reference prefix o- is the same as the orcinary main clause third person
singular perfective prefix o-, (3) is a possible sentence,
(3) ocegö dogalä
3s-close-perf door
'he/she closed the door'
whereas (4) is not:
(4)*ecego dogaläThe non-switch reference prefix e- is possible only in hypotactic subordinate clauses, and is not available in adjacent sentences in discourse or200The syntax of complex sentencesin paratactic constructions. So, the paratactic construction
(5) rwot öpöyö ocegö dogolaking 3s-remember-perf 3s-close-perf door
the king remembered it, he closed the door
'the king remembered to close the door'
does not have a counterpart in
(6)*rwot öpoyö ecegö dogoläeven though the subjects of both verbs in (5) are taken to be coreferential, which in the case of a true hypotactic complement clause would require the non-switch reference prefix e-, as in (1).
We can sum up the characteristic features of paratactic constructions
discussed so far as follows:
1. the two clauses form a phonological unit like simple
sentences and unlike conjoined clauses
2. each clause contains a fully inflected verb
3. the verbs need not agree in aspect; auxiliaries may occur
on either clause
4. each verb may be independently negated
5. only the first verb in the series has an overt subject NP
6. hypotactic switch reference morphology is not available
to the second clause
7. no overt marker of coordination or subordination links
the clauses
8. the subject of the second clause must be an argument of
the first
9.1.3.2 Semantics of parataxisHaving considered some aspects of the syntax of parataxis, it remains now to
consider its semantic aspects and to try to relate the syntax to the semantics.
The twelve sentences given in the introduction to this section are a
representative sample of the sort of semantic relations that can be coded
with the paratactic construction in Lango. It might seem on first inspection, given the diversity of the sample, that any sort of relation between
two propositions can be coded paratactically. This is, in fact, not the case.
The relationships that can be expressed by means of parataxis include
only those that are compatable with a separate assertion of each of the
juxtaposed clauses, where, moreover, both clauses must be taken as true,
a situation that resembles that of ordinary conjunction with 'and'. The
exact nature of the relationship between the two clauses in inferred from
the set of relationships compatable with the meaning of the constructionIntroduction201on the basis of real world knowledge. In this way, more than one interpretation of a paratactic construction is often possible. For instance,
(1)ryek pe m to koipls-wise-hab neg ls-drink-hab beer
'I'm wise, I don't drink beer'
can be interpreted as either
(2) I'm wise because I don't drink beer
or(3) I'm wise therefore I don't drink beer
In cases of real ambiguity, a more exact meaning can be specified by resorting to a non-paratactic construction, so that the meaning of (2) can be
rendered by
(4)ryek pi έη pe m tols-wise-hab because+of it neg ls-drink-hab beer
I'm wise because I don't drink beer
The characterization of the semantics of parataxis given above makes
certain predictions about non-occurring interpretations of paratactic constructions. A few of these will be mentioned here:
(i) Because each of the clauses is asserted to be true, paratactic constructions cannot receive a conditional interpretation. Therefore the sentence
( 1 ) όηέηέ omiye buk3s-saw-perf-3s 3s-give-perf-3s book
he saw him, he gave him the book
can be interpreted as
(2) he saw him give him the book
or(3) when he saw him, he gave him the book
but not as(4) *if he saw him, he gave him the book
The reason, of course, is that in the conditional interpretation neither
clause is asserted to be true.
(ii) Similarly, paratactic constructions cannot be interpreted disjunctively, because this interpretation would require that one of the clauses be interpreted as not true. For instance, the paratactic construction202The syntax of complex sentences(1) däko otedö riijo omyeno kwan
woman 3s-cook-perf meat 3s-cook-perf millet+meal
the woman cooked meat, she cooked millet meal
can mean any of the following:
(2) the woman cooked meat and millet meal
(3) the woman cooked meat because she cooked millet meal
(4) the woman cooked meat therefore she cooked millet meal
but cannot be interpreted disjunctively:
(5) *the woman cooked meat or millet meal
(iii) A paratactic construction consists of a pair of assertions united within
a single sentence, and in this way resembles clauses conjoined by 'and' in
English. Such clauses are normally arranged in a linear order that accords
with their order in real time, so that
(1) Zeke got sick and he died
is acceptable, but
(2) *Zeke died and he got sick
is not. Conjoined clauses may also describe simultaneous actions as in:
(3) he ate and he drank
A similar situation holds in parataxis. Where the two clauses represent
events, their order will correspond to real time order or be interpreted as
being roughly simultaneous. In this way,
(4) an ädSk paco pe anworjo ginnoro
I ls-go+back-perf home neg ls-find-perf thing-indef
I went back home, I didn't find anything
'after I went back home, I didn't find anything'
can't be interpreted as
(5) when I didn't find anything, I went back home
since that would require that the event coded by the second clause be interpreted as occurring before that of the first clause.
(iv) As complements, the second, complement-like clause of a paratactic
construction may only occur where the semantic relation between the
clauses is compatable with the two-assertion aspect of parataxis. The
paratactic complement is a member of a system of oppositions that includes a hypotactic indicative, a subjunctive, and an infinitive (see Sec. 9.3
and Noonan and Bavin 1978a for more detailed discussion of this). TheIntroduction203indicative is used with complements with independent time reference, the
subjunctive and infinitive with clauses with determined time reference,
the infinitive being further specified for equi-subject conditions; it is not
marked for subject agreement. The paratactic complement only occurs in
semantic environments where both the clause containing the complement
taking predicate and the complement clause itself can be interpreted as
separate assertions. This contrasts with the situation in hypotaxis, which
affects all the other complement-types in Lango, where there is a single
assertion involving both the complement taking predicate and the complement, allowing the complement taking predicate to act as a sort of
semantic filter qualifying the interpretaion of the complement.
The system of oppositions in complementation involving the paratactic construction will be illustrated briefly. First, the paratactic complement
and the hypotactic indicative complement:
paratactic complement
(1) ätin änenö loca opajio palächild 3s-see-perf man 3s-blunt-perf knife
the child saw the man, he blunted the knife
'the child saw the man blunt the knife'
(2) jiäkö
yd odino käl
girl 3s-remember-perf 3s-thresh-perf millet
the girl remembered it, she threshed the millet
'the girl remembered to thresh the millet'
hypotactic indicative complement
(3) ätinni loca ojiajio palächild 3s-see-perf comp man 3s-blunt-perf knife
'the child saw that the man blunted the knife'
(4) jiäkö opöyö ni edino käl
girl 3s-remember-perf comp 3s-thresh-perf millet
'the girl remembered that she threshed millet'
(5) rwot binö tämmö ni loca odok
king 3s-come-hab think-infin comp man 3s-go-back-perf
'the king will think that the man went back'
(6) ape aye ni okelo ocämö rec
ls-neg ls-believe-hab comp O. 3s-eat-perf fish
don't believe that Okelo ate the fish'
The paratactic and hypotactic indicative complements share indicative
verb morphology, differentiating both from subjunctive and infinitive
complements. As mentioned above, (hypotactic) indicative complements
are used where the complement has independent time reference vis-ä-vis
the matrix clause, and where the entire sentence constitutes a single assertion. (5) provides an illustration of a case where the time reference of the204The syntax of complex sentencescomplement taking predicate and the complement differ. (3-6) also constitute single assertions; the interpretation of the complement predication
as true or false follows from the meaning of the complement taking predicate, so that the complements in (3-4) are interpreted as true, while those
in (5-6) are interpreted as false. That is, the logical status of the complement is provided by the matrix predicate. In parataxis, there are limitations in time reference possibilities (cf (iii) above) and both clauses must
constitute assertions regardless of the meaning of the first predicate. The
logical status of the second clause is not in any way qualified by the first.
If poy- 'remember' is negated in (2), the meaning is not the negation of
the English gloss, 'the girl didn't remember to thresh millet', since the
only interpretation possible with this gloss is that the girl didn't thresh
the millet. In parataxis each clause is a separate assertion, so negating the
first clause cannot affect the truth value of the second. In fact, the negation of the first clause in (2)
(2) °jiäkö pe opoyo ödinö kal
girl neg 3s-remember-perf 3s-thresh-perf millet
the girl didn't remember is, she threshed millet
results in a semantically anomalous sentence because it makes no sense
to assert that the girl didn't remember something but then did it anyway.
(Note: Anomalous sentences are marked with < 0 > .) Notice that the negation of (4)
(4) jiako pe opoyo ni edino käl
'the girl didn't remember that she threshed millet'
is not semantically anomalous.
Both subjunctive and infinitive complements have determined time
reference, which is to say that the time reference of such complements follows from the meaning of the matrix predicate. For example, in
(1) ämittö läkko tic
ls-want-prog change-infin work
want to change jobs'
(2) amitto ni olSk tic
ls-want-prog comp 3s-change-subj work
want him to change jobs'
both in the infinitive complement in (1) and the subjunctive in (2), the
time reference of the complement must be future relative to the matrix.
The infinitive only occurs where its implied subject is the same as the
matrix subject. Neither subjunctive nor infinitive is marked morphologically for tense or aspect (Sec. 8.2.4).
The subjunctive contrasts with the paratactic complement with a few
predicates. For example, with di- 'press',Introduction205(3) rwot odxa ni akvp burking 3s-press-perf-ls comp ls-dig-subj hole
'the king pressed me to dig a hole'
(4) rwot odxa äkupä bikrking 3s-press-perf-ls ls-dig-perf hole
the king pressed me, I dug a hole
'the king forced me to dig a hole'
the subjunctive (3) receives a 'non-realized' interpretation (Sec. 9.3.1),
hence the gloss with 'press', while the paratactic complement (4) has a
'realized' interpretation, so 'force' is used in the gloss. The realized interpretation in (4) results, of course, from the fact that the second clause is
separately asserted.
In sum the difference between hypotaxis and parataxis can be
diagrammed as in (1):
(1) hypotaxis(complement taking predicate (complement))
ASSERTION
parataxis(complement taking predicate) (complement)
ASSERTION
ASSERTION
Those matrix-complement relations whose interpretation is not compatable with an assertion of both clauses do not occur with paratactic complements. For example, complements do desiderative predicates like
mitto 'want' are not coded paratactically since the second clause cannot
be taken to be a realized event. The same holds for gennö 'hope, trust'.
Utterance predicates like kobbo 'say' also do not take paratactic complements since the use of these predicates does not imply the truth of the
complement, as in
(2) Roscoe said that the Earth is flat
Such complements, except when the matrix verb is present and the subject of the matrix is first person singular, are reports of assertions, not
assertions themselves. Complements to commentative predicates (factives) are similarly not assertions, though they are taken to be true. Their
status as discourse backgrounded material is incompatable with the function of the paratactic construction to display two connected assertions.
Further, modal predicates like tweero 'to be able' and myeero 'to be
necessary' cannot occur as complement taking predicates with paratactic
complements because, like desideratives, their complements do not represent realized events and cannot in themselves constitute assertions.
Paratactic complements do occur in the following environments, all of
which are compatable with an interpretation of each clause as an assertion:206The syntax of complex sentences(a) as complements to immediate perception predicates.
In the sentence
(1) aneno loca omako gweno
ls-see-perf man 3s-catch-perf chicken
I saw the man, he caught the chicken
Ί saw the man catch the chicken'
both the first clause
(2) aneno locaΊ saw the man'and the second clause
(3) omako gweno'he caught the chicken'
can be uttered as separate assertions without damage to the immediate
perception sense of the whole since both the act of perception and the
thing perceived must be real events in order for the sentence as a whole
to be true. Notice also that when the first clause in (1) is negated, the result
is not like the negation of its English translation:
(4)pe aneno loca omako gwenoneg ls-see-perf man 3s-catch-perf chicken
I didn't see the man, he caught the chicken
(4) could mean something like Ί didn't see the man therefore he caught
the chicken', but it can't mean Ί didn't see the man catch the chicken', at
least with the more usual (or unmarked) set of presuppositions. (5),
however, could provide one translation, depending again on what is interpreted to be under the scope of negation:
(5)aneno loca pe omako gwenols-see-perf man neg 3s-catch-perf chicken
I saw the man, he didn't catch the chicken
Ί didn't see the man catch the chicken'
Notice that in (5) the first clause is not under the scope of the negative
particle pe, so the sentence asserts that I saw the man, but denies that he
caught the chicken.
(b) as complements to positive propositional attitude predicates when used
assertively.
Positive propositional attitude predicates, especially with a first person singular subject and the verb in the habitual aspect, can be used both to make
an assertion about the speaker's belief and to make an assertion about the
content of the complement clause. In Lango, this difference is madeIntroduction207manifest in the use of the hypotactic indicative complement when making
an assertion about speaker belief and the paratactic complement when asserting the content of the complement proposition. So the sentence
(1) ätämo ni rwotwä räc
ls-believe-hab comp king-1 pa 3s-bad-hab
believe that our king is bad'
using the hypotactic indicative with its complementizer ni, involves
making an assertion about belief. The corresponding paratactic construction, however, asserts that I believe something, but at the same time asserts the content of the complement proposition:
(2) ätämö rwotwä räcls-think-hab king-1 pa 3s-bad-hab
I think of our king, he is bad
believe our king is bad'
The difference between the two constructions is brought to sharp relief
when they are negated. The hypotactic construction (1) can be negated
with no contradiction,
(3) pe ätämö ni rwotwä räc
neg ls-thing-hab comp king-lpa 3s-bad-hab
don't believe that our king is bad'
since it is belief that is being asserted. In the case of the paratactic construction, where both belief and the badness of the king is being asserted,
its negation
(4) ° pe ätämö rwötwä räcneg ls-think-hab king-lpa 3s-bad-hab
I don't think of the king, he is bad
produces an unacceptable sentence since it is anomalous to assert that you
have no thoughts about the king and then assert that the king is bad. Sentences with prepositional attitude predicates containing paratactic complements have a great deal in common with sentences in other languages
containing parenthetical uses of these predicates (Noonan 1985).
(c) as complements to positive achievement predicates (implicatives).
Achievement predicates like pooyo 'to remember' also take paratactic
complements as in
(1) loca opoyo olwero modo
man 3s-remember-perf 3s-clear-perf compound
the man remembered it, he cleared the compound
'the man remembered to clear the compound'
since an interpretation of the whole is compatable with the assertion of208The syntax of complex sentencesthe two component clauses. Here again, negation of the first clause
produces an anomalous sentence,
(2) ° pe loc» opoyo olwero moda
neg man 3s-remember-perf 3s-clear-perf compound
the man didn't remember it, he cleared the compound
since it makes no sense to assert that the man forgot something and then
to assert that he subsequently did it.
(d) as complements to causative predicates.
When paratactic constructions occur as complements to causative predicates, the complements are always implied to be realized events, as in
( 1 ) däkö odiö atin öjäbo kälwoman 3s-press-perf child 3s-scoop-perf millet
the woman pressed the child, she scooped up millet
'the woman forced the child to scoop up millet'
since both clauses are individually asserted. When the complement is not
taken to be a realized event, another complement-type, the subjunctive,
must be used:
(2) dakö odio atin nz ojäb käl
woman 3s-press-perf child comp 3s-scoop-subj millet
'the woman pressed the child to scoop up millet'
(e) as complements to phasal predicates.
Phasal predicates like cäkkö 'to begin' take paratactic complements because they too are compatable with an interpretation where each clause
is an assertion:
(1) jiako ocako otedo dekgirl 3s-begin-perf 3s-cook-perf stew
the girl began it, she cooked the stew
'the girl began to cook the stew'
Notice, however, that the paratactic construction cannot occur as complements to tyekko 'to finish, cease' because a sentence like
(2) päkö otyeko 6k5p5 totteregirl 3s-finish-perf 3s-help-perf mother-3sa
the girl finished it, she helped her mother
cannot mean 'the girl finished helping her mother' since (2) asserts that
the girl helped her mother and the sequence implied in (2) requires that
the helping follow the finishing. (2) can only mean something like 'whenIntroduction209the girl finished it, she helped her mother'. Complements to tyekko are
coded in the infinitive:
(3) päkö otyekö koppo tottere
girl 3s-finish-perf help-infin mother-3sa
'the girl finished helping her mother'
One further characteristic of paratactic constructions should be noted.
Sentences that consist of paratactically linked clauses can only be embedded as relative clauses (some examples were given above) and as complements to factive predicates where they clearly constitute backgrounded,
not asserted material, and where they constitute reports of assertions, as
in complements to utterance predicates like kobbo 'to say'. Elsewhere,
they are quite unnatural when embedded and it is difficult to assess their
grammaticality. "" This issue is touched on again in Sec. 9.1.4 and 11.2.
In the course of this section, I have referred on a couple of occasions
to the similarity of the paratactic construction to clauses conjoined with
'and' in English. I mentioned, for example, that in both constructions
certain temporal relations between the clauses are normally observed.
A further similarity lies in the sort of logical relations that may be inferred to hold between the clauses. For example, the relation of cause
and consequence can be found in parataxis and in clauses conjoined
with 'and', as in (1):
(1) she took arsenic and (in consequence) fell ill
As Dik (1968) points out, the semantic value of 'and' as a conjoiner of
clauses is only that the clauses 'should be taken as combined in some way'
(p. 266). The exact nature of the relation between the clauses is left to inference, which, as I have indicated above, is the same for clauses in
parataxis.
Lango has no word that functions like English 'and' (Sections 8.7.5
and 9.1.2). The 'and' relation in Lango can be served by parataxis, which
like 'and' in English, functions only to indicate that clauses are to be taken
as combined, without indicating anything further about their semantic
relationship. Note, however, that not all clauses conjoinable with 'and' in
English can be linked paratactically in Lango. For example, in parataxis
the subject of the second clause must be an argument of the first. This constraint, which amounts to a 'topic-link' requirement, greatly limits the
range of parataxis vis-ä-vis 'and'. Conversely, parataxis in Lango is widely used in situations where English would specify the semantic relation.
It is important to stress, however, that parataxis in Lango is distinct
from coordination. For instance, Ross' Coordinate Structure Constraint,
which applies to true coordinate structures in Lango, does not apply to
paratactic constructions (Sections 9.2 and 9.9.1).
In sum, the semantic force of parataxis in Lango is the asyndetic conjunction of two topic-linked assertions. The semantic relation between the
clauses is inferred from real world knowledge, allowing for a variety of210The syntax of complex sentencesinterpretations all of which must be consistent with the two assertion
aspects of the construction.
The grammatical status of parataxis will be discussed further in Sec.
11.2.
9.1.4 SerializationSerial verb constructions occur to a limited extent in Lango. * They have
much in common with paratactic constructions. The constructions share
the following characteristics:
1.
2.
3.both consist of a subject NP followed by a series of verb
phrases
each verb phrase contains a fully inflected verb
no overt marker of subordination or coordination links
the verb phrasesCrosslinguistically, there are many similarities in the semantic ranges of
the two constructions. Both, for instance, may be used in causative, consequential, and directional constructions, among other. Below are some
example of Nupe serialization (George 1976, p. 63-4):
( 1 ) tsoda bici lo dzukoTsoda ran went market
'Tsoda ran to the market'
(2) yigidi la ego wosun took grass dry
'the sun caused the grass to dry'
(3) tsoda gi je afuninTsoda ate food full
'Tsoda ate and he is full'
(Compare sentences (6-9) in the introduction to Sec. 9.1.3).
But the similarity ends there. The verbs in serial constructions have
obligatory agreement in tense-aspect, D whereas paratactic constructions
do not. Further, each clause may be independently negated in parataxis,
whereas with serials only one negative is allowable and has the entire construction within its scope.126 In parataxis, each verb may have a different
subject, though only the first may be an overt NP. With serials, there is only
one grammatical subject, whatever the semantic subject of the following
verbs may be, as in the following Akan example (Schachter 1974, p. 258):
IOC(4)mede aburow migu nsumls-take corn ls-flow water-in
Ί pour corn into the water'Introduction211Clearly aburow 'corn' is the semantic subject of'flow', yet the verb takes
first person concord, agreeing with the subject of the first verb.
The syntactic differences noted above correlate with a crucial semantic difference, namely that paratactic constructions contain two assertions,
while serial constructions contain just one. Independent aspect marking
and negation would seem a necessary consequence of a clause that constitutes a separate assertion, as would a lack of obligatory subject agreement. Note also that the One assertion' aspect of serialization leads to the
possibility of verb compounding (Lord 1975, 1977) where two verbs in a
serial construction constitute a lexical unit. The two assertion aspect of
parataxis would preclude such a possibility.
Lango uses serial constructions as defined above to a limited extent.
They are used, for example, to express comparative and ingressive senses:
comparative
(1) acwealorwot
ls-fat-hab ls-exceed-hab king
'I'm fatter than the king'
(2) däkö dwörj 15 icS
woman 3s-big-hab 3s-exceed-hab man
'the woman is bigger than the man'
ingressive
(3) öwät öyeji cem
lp-go-subj lp-look + for-subj food
'let's go and look for food'
(4) an awoto älijrbo däkö
I ls-go-perf ls-follow-perf woman
went and followed the woman'
followed the woman'
In the comparative and ingressive, there is obligatory subject agreement,
obligatory aspect agreement, and only one negative possible whose scope
is the entire sentence. If (1) is negated,
(5) pe acwe älä rwöt
neg ls-fat-hab ls-exceed-hab king
'I'm not fatter than the king'
we can not infer that I'm not fat or that I exceed the king in anything, inferences that would be possible with a two assertion paratactic construction. The negative of (5) has the entire sentence, not just the first clause,
within its scope.
Serial constructions can be freely embedded and can take the form of
infinitives:212The syntax of complex sentences(1) amitto wot yejipö cem
ls-want-prog go-infin look+for-infin food
want to go look for food'
(2)amitto ewe katto rwotls-want-prog fat-infin exceed-infin king
want to be fatter than the king'
It is instructive to note that the verbs in a paratactic construction cannot
take the form of infinitives analogous to the serial constructions above.
Consider, for example, the following paratactic construction:
(3) ayfto got ali>bo däköls-climb-perf mountain ls-follow-perf woman
I climbed the mountain, I followed the woman
climbed the mountain toward the woman'
Suppose we wish to say (4):
(4) I want to climb the mountain toward the woman
We cannot simply embed the paratactic construction under amitto
analogous to the serial constructions in (1) and (2) above. The reason for
this is the two assertion aspect of parataxis; given the meaning of (4), we
could not separately assert each clause in the complement. In translating
(4), we might opt for a complex construction involving an infinitive and a
purpose phrase:
(5)amitto yitto got me Ivbbo däköls-want-prog climb-infin mountain for follow-infin
woman
want to climb the mountain in order to follow the
woman'
(5) is not exactly synonymous with (4). One could get a meaning closer to
(4) with a paratactic construction; however each verb in the series must
be separately embedded under amitto, which would allow for the preservation of the two assertion aspect of parataxis:
(6)amitto yitto got amitto Ixrbbo daköls-want-prog climb-infin ls-want-prog follow-infin
woman
I want to climb the mountain, I want to follow the
woman
want to climb the mountain toward the woman'
(6) is a bit odd, however, and rather cumbersome for a paratactic construction, but gives us something like the meaning of (4). Serial constructions can easily be embedded as infinitives because they resemble other
sorts of complex constructions in constituting one assertion. ParatacticIntroduction213constructions cannot be embedded except when backgrounded (Sec.
9.1.3) because their two assertion aspect is not compatable with the
semantic environaments found in embedding (Sec. 11.2).
The grammatical status of serialization will be discussed further in
Sec. 11.2.
9.1.5 Reduced clauses: infinitives and gerundsInfinitives in Lango occur in certain contexts where the logical subject of
the embedded clause is identical to the subject of the matrix clause in complement constructions (Sec 9.3),
( 1 ) amxtto gweey odilols-want-prog kick-infin ball
want to kick the ball'
(2) ädäg kwänno bukkils-refuse-hab read-infin book-this
refuse to read this book'
and as nominalizations:
(1) äpwop otitowa ä cecek beer a kwänteacher 3s-tell-perf-lp att+part little+bit good-infin
att+part read-infin
'the teacher told us briefly about the benefits of reading'
(2) dako kwannere herwoman read-infin-3sa 3sa-good-hab
'the woman's reading is good'
(3) matto tabä räcdrink-infin tobacco 3s-bad-hab
'smoking tobacco is bad'
The object of an infinitive is expressed as for verbs — objects do not
form associative relationships with their infinitives. Infinitives take ordinary object inflections, may occur in the middle voice, and have benefactive and ventive forms. In nominalizations only, the subject of the
infinitive can occur as an associative NP with the infinitive as head. This
is illustrated in (1) and by the complex associative (Sec. 8.7.3) in (2).
Human subjects almost always occur in complex associatives when
definite. When both a direct object and a subject are present, the subject
forms an associative relationship with the syntactic unit consisting of the
infinitive and its direct object:214The syntax of complex sentences(4) nekko gwökk ä dako rac
kill-infm dog att+part woman 3s-bad-hab
'the killing of a dog by a woman is bad'
(5) dako nekko gwok'kere räc
woman kill-infin dog-3sa 3s-bad-hab
'the woman's killing of the dog is bad'
In both (4) and (5), dako 'woman' could be interpreted as having an associative relationship with gwök 'dog', so that (5) could be interpreted as
meaning 'the killing of the woman's dog is bad'. Infinitives themselves
may occur in any sort of noun slot: They may be subjects, direct objects,
associatives (as in (1) above), and objects of prepositions:
(6) atie kän me cem
ls-be+present-hab here for eat-infin
'I'm here to eat'
Phenomena that could be interpreted as raising appear to be restricted
to the 'tough-movement' (object to subject) type and do not involve infinitives. This will be discussed below.
Gerunds, which occur also in reduplicative constructions (Sec. 8.10),
are found in two other contexts. First, they are found in purpose constructions (Sec. 9.12.4) with the preposition me 'for, in order to' when the notional object of the verb rendered as a gerund is the head of the
construction:
(1) kälmeäregä
millet for grind-ger
'millet for grinding'
(2) man buk me akwänä
this book for read-ger
'this is a book for reading'
(3) ämäko gweno me äcämänä
ls-catch-perf chicken for eat-ger-lsa
caught a chicken for me to eat'
Notice that the notional subject of the gerund in the last example is
rendered as an associative pronoun affix, attesting to the nominal status
of gerunds, at least in this construction. This interpretation of gerunds
is further attested by the fact that gerunds can be object of preposition
(e.g. me).
Gerunds are also used in what appears to be the only instance of something that could be analyzed as raising in the language:
(1) cämmo gweno ber
eat-infin chicken 3s-good-hab
'eating chicken is good'Relative clauses
/ f\\v*·v'215A(2) gweno her acama
chicken 3s-good-hab eat-ger
'chicken is good to eat'
b«r 'good' is the only predicate that clearly allows this construction. Here,
as in purpose constructions, gerunds are used when the nominalized predicate is separated from its object.","[210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"
"When plural and associative affixes combine in a single word, the
order is:
(1)Root + Plural + AssociativeThe plural and associative affixes combine in the usual way, subject
to the ordinary rules of tone sandhi and vowel harmony. The plural suffixes are not deleted by contraction:86The structure of Lango words(2)torjni 'spears'wele 'visitors'Isa

or topicality and are referred to collectively as determiners. The deictic
affixes express three relations of spatial deixis:6^
(1)-ni
-no'this: near the speaker'
'that: near the hearer'""ca
-ka'yonder: remote from speaker and hearer'As in many other languages, the essentially locative reference of these
forms may be extended metaphorically into temporal or psychological
dimensions. The syntax of these forms is discussed in Sec. 8.7.1 and 8.7.4.
See Sec. 1.2.3 for discussion of cluster simplification vis-ä-vis these forms
and Sec. 2.5.2 for their role in vowel harmony.
-ni has a little used plural counterpart -gi. Its use seems confined to
nouns which lack distinctive plurals, thereby insuring for them a plural
interpretation. It is not obligatory with these forms, however, and it was
never recorded spontaneously on any noun otherwise marked for
plurality. So, guluni can mean either 'this pot' or 'these pots' since gulu
has no distinctive plural; however, gulugi can only mean 'these pots'. The
noun gwoggi 'dogs' is distinctively marked for plurality (the singular is
gwök): both gwoggini and gwoggigi therefore mean 'these pots', but only
the former is likely to be heard.
-no also has a plural counterpart -go, but this form was never spontaneously offered, even with words like gulu. Nonetheless, gulugo was understood as meaning 'those pots' though one informant complained it
sounded more like Luo than Lango.
-cä and -ka are synonymous, but -ka is quite rare. -ca/-ka have a little
used plural counterpart -ica, which is found only after words ending in
consonants. Like -cä itself, the initial / / in this form is not subject to vowel
harmony, -icä conditions gemination of preceding consonants.

It is phonologically identical to the 3sa alienable affix -mere so that forms
like gwenomere can mean either 'the aforementioned chicken' or 'his/her
chicken'.
The indefinite suffix is -moro, which has a plural counterpart -mogo
(Sec. 8.7.4). As with the deictic suffixes, the plural form is not obligatory
with nouns with a plural sense.","[101, 102, 103]"
"Since nouns, like adjectives, have independent lexical tone, the conjugation of predicate nouns is precisely like that of adjectives: the tonal
countour is the product of the tone of the subject prefix and the inherent
tone of the noun.
For the syntax of predicate noun and adjective constructions, see
Sec. 8.3.
5.4.4 Deverbal adjectives
Deverbal adjectives can be formed from verbs by prefixing a- and suffixing
-a to the verbal root, which takes on a HL contour (simplified by UFS
before the following H of the suffix -ä. The suffix is subject to vowel
harmony.
(1) Infinitive
jiwallo 'to bear (a child)'
paddo 'to
flatten'
ryebbo 'to turn upside
down'
jiäkkö 'to grind coarsely'
dillo
'to sqeeze together, pack'
dwoayo 'to twist'Deverbal Adjective
ajiwä'lä Own begotten'
apa'da
'flat'
arye'ba 'upside down'
ajia'ka
ädi'lä
adwo'a'coarse'
'squeezed together'
'askew, twisted'Prepositions107These forms have the peculiarity that they are not conjugated for person, unlike ordinary adjectives. Further, they usually occur with a copular
verb like bedö 'to sit, stay, be' or doko 'to become':
(2)bokcinz ärye'ba
box-this upside+down
'this box is upside down'
bokcxnx bedö arye'ba
box-this 3s-sit-hab upside+down
'this box is upside down'A copular verb is always used (at least in my data) when the subject
agreement is not 3s:
(3)adoko arye'ba
ls-become-perf upside+down
'I'm upside down'5.5 Prepositions
Lango has a small set of true prepositions, i.e. words that can express locative and relational senses without forming complex phrasal units with i
On, at, in, about, to, from' — see Sec. 8.8 for discussion. Even the true
prepositions are transparently related to (or derived from) nouns. For example, te 'under' also has the nominal meaning 'end, side, back' and can
be found with this sense in many nominal compounds: te poto 'the boundary of a field', te wie 'the back of the head', te ""yit 'the back of the ear'.
Most prepositions take their pronominal objects as inflections. These
inflected prepositions take object suffixes which are identical to those used
in inalienable possession of nouns (Sec. 5.2.4). However, those prepositions ending in a vowel do not use the expected nasal initial affixes (-na
'my' as opposed to -ä), but instead insert an epenthetic /r/ between the
preposition and the suffix (Sec. 1.5.2). Tonal patterns in general follow
those for inalienable possession, but there are some idiosyncracies.

5.6.1 Personal pronouns: independent forms
The affixal personal pronouns have already been discussed (Sec. 5.3.2,

is discussed in Sec. 8.7.6. Below is a list of these forms:

'you (sg)'
'he, she, it'
'we'
'you (pi)'gin'they'5.6.2 Demonstrative pronouns: independent formsThe affixal demonstratives were discussed in Sec. 5.2.6.
The independent, or free-standing, demonstrative pronouns are built
off a stem ma- to which are suffixes the affixal demonstratives:

'that'
'yonder'SG

Apart from some early section of the phonology where phonetic symbols
are used, the transcription employed in this grammar is an adaptation of
what has come to be the standard orthography for Lango, modified so as
to show tone, vowel quality, and gemination. Except where phonological
derivations are discussed, the transcription presupposes the application
of tone sandhi and coalescence word internally. The tone sandhi and
coalescence rules are applied in external sandhi in Part I, Phonology, and
Part II, Morphology, so as to provide examples of the application of the
rules, but not in Part III, Syntax, so as not to impede morpheme identification and to comply with the conventions of Lango orthography. It is
hoped that this will provide no inconvenience to the reader.
The phonetic symbols are discussed in Sec. 1.1 for consonants, 2.1 for
vowels, and 4.1 for tones. The symbols used in the modified standard orthography are given in Sec. 1.3 for consonants and 2.4 for vowels.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"
"8.2.2 The middle voiceThe basic function of the middle voice in Lango is to signal that the subject is affected by the action of the verb. The middle includes reflexive
and reciprocal senses, as well as an SA sense. '
All uses of the middle
include the sense of the subject as an 'affected entity' (Klaimann 1988).
Like passive, middle voice presupposes an active, transitive counterpart,
and also like passive, middle sentences are intransitive.
The intransitivity of the Lango middle is evident even in its reflexive
use, in contrast to the English reflexive, which is syntactically transitive.
In English, the reflexive pronouns, myself,yourself, etc., function as DO's.
The Lango middle is formed by adding a suffix to a Tr verb stem: - if
C2 is alveolar or zero, and -ere if C2 is non-alveolar. The suffix -e is
accompanied by gemination of C2 throughout the verbal paradigm. (See
Sec. 5.3.4 for details.) These suffixes simply code middle voice and do
not agree with the Su, as do the cognate reflexive pronoun affixes in
closely related Luo:
(1)LuoLangoälwokaräälwokerewashed myselfilwokori
61w6koreilwakere
olwikcre'you washed yourself
'she washed herselfMany verb roots that lack an SA stem construct an SA valence scheme
with the middle voice (Sec. 8.2.1):

valence scheme. As in the case of SA stems, the SO use of the middle does
not constitute a passive. (4b), for example carries no more implication of
an external agency than does its English translation.
The middle is used also for a reflexive when the subject is coreferential with the logical direct object:

Okelo talked to Alaba about himselfThe middle also has a reciprocal sense:
(4)gin ogooye
they 3p-beat-mid-perf
'they are beating each other'(4) could also mean 'they are beating themselves'. However, if this latter
meaning is intended, ken- would likely be used as this reinforces the
reflexive sense:
(5)gin ögoöye kengi
they 3p-beat-mid-perf self-Spa
'they're beating themselves'The middle voice is only possible with non-stative predicates, so predicates like mitto 'to want', tie 'to be present', tammo 'to think', etc. will not
form middles. For non-stative predicates, the distribution of reflexive and
SA senses with the middle is not random, but rather is based on the valence
scheme of the Tr predicate. When the Tr has an inanimate DO, the middle will take this inanimate argument as Su and have an SA interpretation.","[148, 149]"
"8.8 Prepositional phrases
Lango has a very small set of true prepositions, which include the
following:
i
bag
bot
me
pi
te
tu
kä
kede (or ke)
ginniOn, at, in, about, to, from'
'to'(somewhat archaic)
'to'
'for'
'because of
'under'
'toward'
'instead of
'with'
'with'Each of these prepositions except i and ginni has a characteristic set of
object pronoun affixes; the plain form is used with noun objects:
bot
pxra
bot»
piri
boti
pire
böte
bötwä
IP pxwa
piwu
bötwu
2P
bötgi
3p Pig*
ginni does not take pronominal objects (Sec. 8.7.5). i takes noun and
pronominal objects that refer to non-humans,ElIs
2s
3s(1)iye
i buk'in, about, on, etc. it'
'in, about, on, etc. the book'but cannot take objects that refer directly to humans. When such nouns
or pronouns are the logical object of i, the noun kom 'body' is used as the
object of i, with the appropriate noun or pronoun as its inalienable possessor (cf Sec. 8.7.3):
(2)i kom däkö
i koma
i kömi'in about, on, etc. the woman'
'in about, on, etc. me'
'in about, on, etc. you'The organization of the noun phrase171Prepositional phrases normally consist of a preposition followed by its
NP object, or a preposition inflected for pronominal object. There are two
sorts of complications both involving i. First, prepositional phrases may
consist of i (rarely some other preposition) followed by a second preposition followed by the object:
(1)loca owoto ökko i bot däkoman 3s-walk-perf completely at to woman
'the man walked after the woman'
(2)dako öbeö i te yatwoman 3s-move-perf at under branch
'the woman walked under the branch'
(3)loca owoto tu bot dakoman 3s-walk-perf toward to woman
'the man walked toward the woman'
Combinations of prepositions plus preposition must be individually listed
in the lexicon because all combinations are not possible and the meaning
resulting from such combinations is not always predictable, e.g. i bot
'after, from'.
Second, i combines with body part nouns and locational nouns to form
locative expressions:
(1)i wi bäkci
on head boxOn top of the box'
(2)z dog kuluon mouth river
On the edge of the river'
(3)kor ot
on chest house
'against the house'(4)i yi at
at stomach house
'into, out of the house'(5)i kin pern aryoin space ^between bridge two
'between two bridges'
Notice than an inalienable associative relationship is established between
the nouns. Constructions consisting of i, a preposition, and a body part
noun are also possible:172The syntax of simple sentences(6)i ka wag dako

'instead of the woman'8.9 Interrogative constructions
Yes/no questions are distinguished from their corresponding declaratives
by intonation only — there are no interrogative particles, no word order
changes, etc. Interrogative sentences of all types have a rising intonation
contour that peaks sharply on the last two syllables.
Information questions contain interrogative words; they otherwise
possess no syntactic properties that distinguish them from their corresponding declaratives. The interrogative word occurs in whatever syntactic slot is appropriate to its grammatical use. It is not possible to simply
front interrogative words — simple fronting is interpreted as topicalization and interrogative words cannot be topics (Sec. 8.5.2). Initial position
may be (optionally) achieved via clefting (Sec. 9.8). Compare the declarative and interrogative sentences below:
(1)a. okelo όηέηό όρίόO. 3s-see-perf O.
Okelo saw Opio'
b. t)a όηέηο όρίό?
who 3s-see-perf Ο.
'who saw Opio?'
c. n ante όηέηο όρίό?
who rel+part 3s-see-perf O.
'who saw Opio?'
d. na έη me όηέηο όρίό?who it rel+part 3s-see-perf Ο.
'who saw Opio?'
Note: sentence (b), where the subject is questioned directly, is a somewhat unusual sentence in Lango and may simply be a product of English
influence. 1 1 1 In my notes, such constructions only occur as translations of English sentences. In context, (c), which consists of the interrogative pronoun followed by a relative clause, is the usual mode of
questioning subjects, but (d), a cleft construction, is also possible. The
reason for the (apparent) unacceptability of (b) as a fully native construction is that in (b) the interrogative pronoun rja is found in clauseinitial position and therefore should receive a definite, topical
interpretation, which it cannot, (c) as a relative clause and (d) as a focus
(i.e. contrastive) cleft construction do not violate the aforementionedInterrogative constructions173topic-first principle. In questioning the direct object, as we see in (e),
the interrogative pronoun is not frontal.

The order ben-DO is invariable in post-verbal position.
Verbs are both inflected for DO (but not necessarily when followed by
a DO NP) and marked for transitivity (Section 8.2.1):

'the man saw me'
(5)an anenoI ls-see-perf
Ί saw' (Ί was not blind')
Non-human DO's are not pronominalized; the transitive verb alone suffices:
(1)aneno bukls-see-perf book
Ί saw the book'Basic order of the sentence(2)121aneno
ls-see-perf
saw it'Datives, referred to here as indirect objects (IO), may occur either as
the object of the preposition bot 'to', in which case they follow the DO,
(1)loca omxyo buk bot dakö
man 3s-give-perf book to woman
'the man gave the book to the woman'or without bot, in which case the IO must precede the DO:
(2)loca omiyö dakö buk
man 3s-give-perf woman book
'the man gave the woman the book'If both ben and IO occur in the same sentence, the IO must be expressed
with bot:
(3)loca omiiyx ätin buk bot dakö
man 3s-give-ben-perf child book to woman
'the man gave the book to the woman for the child'When an IO immediately follows the verb, it and not the DO conditions
verb agreement:
(4)loca omiya buk
man 3s-give-perf-ls book
'the man gave me the book'If both are pronominalized, the transitive verb suffices for a non-human
DO:
(5)loca ömiyä
man 3s-give-perf-ls
'the man gave it to me'If the DO is human and pronominalized, the IO must be expressed as an
object of bot:
(6)loca ömiye bota
man 3s-give-perf-3s to-Is
'the man gave him (e.g. a slave) to me'A pronominalized ben, IO, and DO can be accommodated by inflecting
the verb ( with a ben stem) for the ben argument, inflecting bot 'to' for
the IO; the transitive stem suffices for the DO if non-human:
(7)loca omriye bota
man 3s-give-ben-perf-3s to-Is
'the man gave it to me for him'122The syntax of simple sentencesIf a ben is present, a human DO cannot be pronominalized unless it is
made the topic (Section 1.5.2):
(8)en loca okellahe man 3s-bring-ben-perf-ls
'he was brought by the man for me'
But even this strategy is not available if the DO is first or second person.
In such cases, an alternative sentence type is used, e.g.:
(9)loca okele piraman 3s-bring-perf-3s because+of-ls
'the man brought him because of me'
Prepositional phrases, whether complements or adjuncts, must follow the
ben, DO, or IO (formed with or without bot):
(1)loca ömiiyi ätin buk bot däkö pi rwotman 3s-give-ben-perf child book to woman because
of king
'the man gave the book to the woman for the child
because of the king'
Adverbial adjuncts are placed either at the beginning or end of the sentence:
(2)awo'ro loca ogweo gwökyesterday the man 3s-kick-perf dog
'yesterday, the man kicked the dog'
(3)loca ögeö gwök awo'roman 3s-kick-perf dog yesterday
'the man kicked the dog yesterday'
The significance of the word order variations described above will be discussed in later sections, for instance Sec. 8.5.
The negative particles pe and the more conservative mom (~ mam)
are normally placed between the subject and verb:
(1)loca öbinö päcoman 3s-come-perf home
'the man came home'
(2)loca pe obinö päcoman neg 3s-come-perf home
'the man didn't come home'
When the negative appears at the beginning of the sentence, the interpretation may be one of 'external' negation, versus the 'internal' negation of the post subject position. This interpretation is possible only with
an intonational contour which does not drop normally, but stays high
throughout the subject NP, accompanied by a lengthening of pe:Verbal complex(3)123pee rwott a yügända wie ötalneg king att+part U. head-3sa 3s-wither-perf
'the King of Uganda isn't bald (because there is no King
of Uganda)1
Compare (3) with (4), which has ordinary internal negation:
(4)rwotta yUganda wie pe ötalking att+part U. head-3sa neg 3s-wither-perf
'the King of Uganda isn't bald'
(4) presupposes that there is a King of Uganda. The usual situation 0 "" illustrated by (3) is perhaps made possible because pe doubles as a verb
meaning 'tobe not present, not exist' (Sec. 8.4). It should be emphasized
that preposed pe does not always have this interpretation.
Qf\8.2 Verbal complex
8.2.1 TransitivityIn Lango, any difference in the presence of nuclear arguments (and even
some non-nuclear arguments, as in the case of benefactives) necessitates
a change of verb stem. In Sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.3, we will examine
these stems.
Most non-nuclear arguments, however, can be added without affecting the verb stem in any way. Non-nuclear arguments (aside from the
benefactive) will always be objects of prepositions.","[136, 137, 138, 139]"
"125Verbal complex8.2.1.2 Transitive, activity naming, and secondary argument stems
In Lango, a verb root frequently has two (very rarely three) stems that
represent generalized valence schemes whose characteristics can be summarized as follows:
1) Transitive (tr): Tr stems refer to an action or state as it
affects a direct object, which may be definite or non-definite,
specific or non-specific.
2) Activity Naming (AN): AN stems express a potentially
transitive notion, but without any reference to a DO. They
refer solely to a subject's participation in an activity, but not
activity directed toward any particular object.
3) Secondary Argument (SA): SA verbs are defined relative
to their corresponding transitives. The argument that would
be the DO of a transitive is the Su of the corresponding SA
form.85
Any given verb stem in Lango is specified for valence scheme so that a Tr
verb cannot be given an AN use, and vice versa. This, of course, represents a difference between Lango and English, since Lango has no verbs
like English eat, which can be given either a Tr or AN sense.
It is very rare for a Lango verb root to have stems representing all
three generalized valence schemes. In fact only one verb root nenp 'see'
(illustrated below (la)) clearly has all three. Many two place predicates
have only a Tr valence scheme; many others contrast a Tr with an AN or
SA. A few examples follow. The infinitive is used as the citation form,

Lango verb roots are basically of the form CiVC2- In the infinitive,
the transitive is distinctive in having a geminate C2 (if C2 is r, the vowel
is lengthened instead), a final -o, and low tones on root and final
vowels. AN and SA forms do not have a geminate Cg, may or may not128The syntax of simple sentenceshave a final -o, and exhibit a variety of tonal contours. 87
For any transitive relation expressed verbally, a Tr form exists, so that
there are no ΑΝ/SA pairs without a corresponding Tr.
Tr and AN forms do not differ simply in the presence or absence of
an expressed DO. In fact, there need not be an overt DO with a Tr verb;
in such cases the Tr will differ in meaning from its corresponding AN:
(1)camo dek
ls-eat-perf stew
Ί ate stew'Tr(2)acamo
ls-eat-perf
Ί ate it'Tr(3)acemo
ls-eat-perf
Ί ate'ANNotice that the form of the verb does not differ in (1), with a nominal
DO and (2), with a pronominal DO indicated here by the plain Tr verb.
Nevertheless, even without an overt DO, (2) still expressed a transitive
notion, referring to the effect of an action on a DO. (2) would only be
felicitous if the unexpressed DO were known to the hearer, obvious from
the surroundings, or mentioned previously in discourse. (3), on the other
hand, refers solely to an activity without reference to its effect on an object, and would be felicitous where the act of eating itself was the object
of communication and the logically inferable object was irrelevant to the
discourse.
SO forms resemble passives in that the DO of the corresponding Tr is
the Su of the SA verb. They are, however, best not viewed as passives for
a variety of reasons. First, as mentioned above, SA forms are not freely
available for all transitive notions, even those that involve activities. For
example, the Tr verbs αέρρό 'to collect, gather', geero 'to build', kwallo
'to steal', and ryetto 'to winnow' do not have SA counterparts (though each
has an AN counterpart). Further, sentences with SA predicates are not
morphologically or syntactically marked relative to their Tr counterparts;
SA verbs may in fact be considerably simpler, consisting only of the unembellished root while Tr verbs always have final -o (except in the subjunctive). Compare Tr c gg 'to heal' with SA cag 'to recover':
(1)d kt l ocaijo locaTrdoctor 3s-heal-perf man
'the doctor healed the man'
(2)loca ocag
man 3s-recover-perf
'the man recovered'SAVerbal complex129Lack of productivity and markedness relationships are important but not
decisive factors in considering SA verbs not to be passives. The most important factor is simply that SO verbs lack a true passive sense. They are
not necessarily stative, and may have agent Su's. For example, SA »mo
'to yawn' (cf Tr ammo 'to cause to yawn') and SA dok 'to go back' (cf Tr
dwökkö 'to bring back') are active verbs with agent Su's:
(1)locaa aarno
man 3s-yawn-prog
'the man is yawning'SA(2)däkö ödäk
woman 3s-go+back-perf
'the woman went back'SAThere is no sense in which (1) or (2) suppose some external agency that
is, for whatever reasons, non-overt. In other words, (2) does not mean 'the
woman was brought back', where there is a clear sense that some nonovert agency was responsible for the action. A gloss like this would be expected if dak were the passive counterpart of dwokkd.88
In sum, any verb root in Lango with a transitive valence scheme may
have, together with its Tr stem form, another stem representing an intransitive valence scheme, whose Su corresponds to the Tr Su (AN) or the
transitive DO (SA). The relations between the valence schemes these stems
represent can be schematized as below, the arrows indicating a correspondence between the arguments:
Tr:SuVDOAN:
SA:8.2.1.3 ProductivityAs indicated above, not all verb roots distinguish a Tr from an intransitive stem. For unpaired verbs, the form follows the function. Unpaired
intransitive verbs in the infinitive take the form CVC or CVCo without
gemination of Cg, thus resembling AN and SA forms: dwogo 'to come
back, return', yaä 'to leave, go away', wot 'to go, walk', binö 'to come'.
Unpaired transitive verbs are morphologically identical to paired transitives: mitto 'to want', cwallo 'to send', jwatto 'to hit', keddo 'to braid,
scarify'. So, the form of any verb provides no indication of whether the
root is also represented by another valence scheme, but instead conforms to the transitivity of the valence scheme itself.
Easily the majority of Lango verb roots with a valence of two or more
distinguish a Tr valence scheme from an AN or SA valence scheme and130The syntax of simple sentencesthus are represented by more than one stem. The question now arises as
to which roots with transitive valence schemes will have an AN or SA
counterpart. Before proceeding, it is of interest to note that the English
translations of Tr verbs that lack AN counterparts almost always require
either an overt DO or have an SA interpretation when intransitive. For
example, the unpaired Tr verbs noted in the paragraph above all require
overt DO's in English. The verbs want, send, hit (apart from a baseball context), and braid would almost invariably be accompanied by an overt DO,
as opposed to, say, eat or cook, which can frequently be found without one.
In other words, the lack of an AN stem in Lango corresponds to difficulty in detransitivizing in English. Similarly, the presence of a TR/SA opposition in Lango frequently implies an English counterpart whose
intransitive has an SA interpretation. So the Lango Tr verbs dakko 'to
transfer', gommo 'to bend', kakko 'to split', and wällö 'to boil' all have SA
counterparts. The English translations of these verbs all have SA interpretations when intransitive:
the man transferred
the metal bent
the wood split
the water boiled(they transferred the rnan)
(they bent the metal)
(the fire split the wood)
(the boy boiled the water)In other words, whether semantic/pragmatic factors are in operation in
Lango to produce the various stems, similar factors are also operative in
English regulating the valence schemes available to English verbs.
Whether any given Tr verb will have an AN, SA, or no intransitive
counterpart depends on its meaning and the details of its valence
scheme. If the Tr has a subject that is necessarily animate and a DO that's
necessarily inanimate, it will have an AN counterpart provided that the
verb describes activities like the following: mundane day-to-day activities such as eating, reciting/reading, shaving, sweeping, preparation
of food, physiological functions such as vomiting, or economic activities
such as those relating to the planting, care, and preparation of millet or
other crops, building, or business activities such as trading. In all these
cases, the DO of any of these predicates would be eminently predictable
in the context of traditional Lango society, so its omission would not
result in information loss. The activity itself, not the activity as applied
to a particular object, is what is communicatively significant. So, with a
berb like Tr dinno 'to thresh', the DO could only be kal 'millet' except
under circumstances that would be familiar to everyone with whom one
would have day-to-day contact. Even with predicates like Tr deppo 'to
collect, gather (fruits or vegetables)' whose objects are potentially more
various, the sort of fruit or vegetable that would be collected would be
obvious from the subject, time of year, etc. Both these verbs then have
AN counterparts, dinö and depo. But a verb like mitto 'to want', for example, would not have an object predictable out of context and therefore has no AN counterparts. So, two factors are relevant for a Tr/ANVerbal complex131pair: animacy considerations and predictability of DO. When the DO is
not predictable and/or is of some interest or is relevant in the context
of a discourse, the Tr is always available.
A few Tr/AN pairs fall outside the above generalizations. Verbs of emotion, whose English counterparts are all intransitive, form Tr/AN pairs.
Tr kokko 'to cry over', Tr lello 'to rejoice over', Tr peero 'to laugh at' all
have AN counterparts. A few other isolated roots have exceptional Tr/AN
valence schemes: these also have English intransitives as counterparts: Tr
riggo 'to run from' (AN riijo 'to run'), Tr pwallo 'to give birth to', and Tr
leggo 'to pray to'. Also exceptional is Tr ηέηηό 'to see', whose AN nen
has no counterpart in any other sensory verb.89
In the case of Tr/SA pairs, the Tr typically describes the causation of
physical functions with the SA describing the act itself (e.g. Tr ammo 'to
cause to yawn', SA onto 'to yawn'; Tr jiiro 'to cause to sneeze', SA jir 'to
sneeze'), or the Tr may describe a change of state, with the resulting state
described by the SA (e.g. Tr kweeyo 'to cool', SA kwee 'to be cool'; Tr nfeero
'to wilt', SAner'to wilt'; Tr dogrp 'to grow', SAdwog 'to be big'; Tr mokko
'to make sickly', SA mok 'to be sickly'). The agency with such predicates
is often the elements or an act of nature, difficult to specify and often irrelevant in ordinary day-to-day situations. When the agency is relevant,
a Tr verb is used; when it isn't, the SA verb is used.
For a few Tr/SA pairs, the Tr Su is necessarily animate: Tr's dakko 'to
transfer', dwokko 'to bring back' and kobbo 'to transfer*. For these motion verbs, the corresponding SO has an obligatorily animate Su which is
also agentive. The Su of the SA corresponds to both Su and DO of the Tr
counterpart. 90 That is, a sentence with SO dok 'to go back',
(1)adok
ls-go+back-perf
Ί went back'SAis more-or-less equivalent to the reflexive middle with Tr dw kk 'to bring
back':
(2)adwokere
ls-bring+back-middle-perf
Ί brought myselfMiddleAll these pairs have in common that the DO of the Tr is not
stereotyped or predictable, unlike the Tr DO of Tr/AN pairs. When an
SA verb is used, the logically inferrable agency is communicatively irrelevant or, in the case of motion verbs, can be inferred to be the same
as the SA Su. Verbs like jwatto 'to hit', cwallo 'to send', etc. don't have
AN or SA counterparts because neither the Su nor the DO is stereotyped
or irrelevant in ordinary communicative situations. Tr/AN and Tr/SA
pairs are not present idiosyncratically in the lexicon, but rather are, in
general predictable on the basis of the semantic/pragmatic considerations mentioned above. This is true despite the fact that the form of the132The syntax of simple sentencesintransitive is (synchronically) unpredictable and each stem must be
separately lexicalized.
The similarity in form noted above of AN and SO verbs is never likely to be communicatively disfunctional, i.e. they are not likely to be confused, because the pragmatics of each verb would determine conclusively
which it had to be.","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148]"
"134The syntax of simple sentencesWhen the Tr DO is animate, the middle will take this argument as its Su
and have a reflexive interpretation. The generalization here is that if the
Tr Su can be interpreted as the DO also, there will be a reflexive interpretation. But if the Tr Su cannot be interpreted as coreferential with the
DO because the Su is animate and the DO inanimate, there will be an SA
interpretation and the inanimate Tr Su will be the subject of the middle.
Recall that the significance of the middle is that the Su is affected by the
action of the verb. So, the middle of Tr teddö 'to cook' and Tr pyetto 'to
winnow' will have an SA interpretation because their DO is inanimate, but
the middle of TR likko 'to struggle with' and Tr gweppo 'to scratch' will
have a reflexive interpretation:
(1)rirjo oteddemeat 3s-cook-mid-perf
'the meat got cooked'
(2)käl opyette
millet 3s-winnow-mid-perf
'the millet is winnowed'(3)ocaka olikere
O. 3s-struggle+with-mid-perf
Ochaka struggled with himself(4)ogwepereO. 3s-scratch-mid-perf
Opio scratched himself
The middle is occasionally used in contexts where one might expect
an AN verb. In such cases, the middle seems to be chosen because of the
sense of the subject of the middle as an affected entity. For example, the
Tr verb pwallo 'to give birth to' has an AN counterpart pwäl. The middle
can be seen to contrast with the latter in the following pair:
(1)dakö ogiko pwäl
woman 3s-stop-perf give+birth-infin
'the woman stopped bearing children'AN(2)dakö ogiko pwalle
woman 3s-stop-perf give+birth-mid-infin
'the woman stopped bearing children'Middle(1) simply states the fact, but (2) contributes also the sense of the woman
as being affected, perhaps adversely, by this.
8.2.3 Benefactive and ventive stemsIn completing our survey of Lango verb stems representing different
valence schemes, mention should be made of ventive and benefactiveVerbal complex135stems. Ventive stems are available only for a small number of motion verbs
and are formed by adding the suffix -o to the root, geminating C2- The
sort of valence scheme represented by a ventive stem varies with each verb
root, but always refers to motion toward the speaker. For example, ventive cwällö 'to send (to me)' has a valence scheme like its corresponding
Tr cwallo 'to send' with the addition of the first person reference:
(1)dakö ocwalo buk botgi
Tr
woman 3s-send-perf book to-3p
'the woman sent the book to them'(2)däko ocwallo buk
Ventive
woman 3s-send-ven-perf book
Oft
'the woman sent the book to meSimilarly ventive küttö 'to blow (to me)' has a valence scheme more like
Tr k-irtto than AN küto:
(3)yamo öküttö apüa
wind 3s-blow-ven-perf dust
'the wind blew dust at me'VentiveBut when comparing ventive riggo 'to run (to me)' to other stems from
the same root, AN rirjo 'to run' and Tr riggo 'to run from', the ventive
resembles the AN stem:
(4)ätin origgo
child 3s-run-ven-perf
'the child ran to me'VentiveAnd comparing mollo 'to float (to me)' with Tr rnMlo 'to float' and SA mol
'to float', the ventive most resembles the SA verb:
(5)yät omollö
wood 3s-float-ven-perf
'the wood floated toward me'VentiveBenefactive stems can be formed corresponding to any valence scheme
with an agent subject. In addition to the arguments specified by the nonbenefactive valence scheme, the benefactive references a benefactive (or
antibenefactive)
argument. For example, Tr cwallo 'to send' has a
benefactive counterpart cwälli 'to send for'. Compare (6) with (1) above:
(6)dakö ocwalli atin buk botgi
Tr-ben
woman 3s-send-ben-perf child book to-3p
'the woman sent the book to them for the child'The benefactive is formed by geminating Cg of the verb root. The suffix
-i is attached to the root when the benefactive argument is a noun or a
third person singular non-human pronoun. In other cases, the appropriate
DO pronoun suffix is substituted:136The syntax of simple sentences(1)a. okelo
3s-bring-perf
'he brought it'Trb. okelli däkö
Tr-ben

(2)a. ökela
3s-bring-perf-ls
'he brought me'Trb. okella
3s-bring-ben-perf- Is
'he brought it for me'Tr-benBenefactive stems may correspond to both transitive and intransitive
valence schemes. The verbs Tr leggo 'to pray to' and AN lego 'to pray'
both have benefactive counterparts:
(3)olegga obana
3s-pray-ben-perf-ls God
'he prayed to God for me'Tr-ben(4)olegga
3s-pray-ben-perf-ls
'he prayed for me'AN-ben8.2.4 Expression of tense and aspect
The Lango verb is inflected for three aspects, perfective, progressive, and
habitual, but is not inflected for tense. Out of context, however, the aspects
will be given a pragmatic tense assignment and tense distinctions can be
made by use of various auxilliaries, as we shall see.
The three aspects are clearly distinguished inflectionally. Paradigms
are provided below for Tr cämmo 'to eat' (See Sec. 5.3.2 for an extensive
discussion of verb conjugation):

The use of non-switch reference forms is taken up in Sec. 9.3.2. The perfective alone distinguishes a form used with the pronomial subject en 'he,
she, it' and with relativized subjects (Sec. 9.2) from a form used with noun
subject and zero subjects:
(1)a.ocämohe 3s-eat-perf
'he ate it'
b . loca ocamo
^*^V^man 3s-eat-perf
'the man who ate it'
(2)a. loca ocamo
man 3s-eat-perf
'the man ate it'
b. ocamo3s-eat-perf
'he ate it'
When the subject is a plural noun, the ordinary 3s form of the verb is used:
(3)mon camowomen 3s-eat-hab
'women eat it'
(4)*mon ocämö
women 3p-eat-hab
'women eat it'See Sec. 8.7.7.
The perfective is non-durative or bounded; that is, it is used to
describe completed activities bounded in time. It describes a single
dynamic event or process where something, either the subject or direct
object is affected by the action of the verb. Events coded in the perfective are viewed as a whole, whose completion is a necessary prerequisite
to a subsequent event.
The progressive shares with the perfective that it describes a single
event or process affecting an entity. It differs from the perfective in that
the event or process is not viewed as completed or bounded. Rather it takes
the perspective of an ongoing process or event, whose completion is not a
necessary prerequisite for a subsequent event in a narrative discourse.
The habitual contains both a true habitual and a stative sense. The
habitual like the progressive is durative and unbounded by fixed reference
points in time. The states or events described may be single or multiple
(true habitual). The attributive is fundamentally attributive, whereas the
progressive and perfective are applicative, describing events. A large
number of stative predicates are only inflected in the habitual.","[149, 150, 151, 152, 153]"
"2.8.2 Varying forms of the stem vowelAs noted in Sec. 2.5.2, the stem vowel -o has some harmonic irregularities:
it takes the form -o following the root vowels /o/ and /IT/, but appears asNon-productive alternations41/ / elsewhere, even following the [-ATR] root vowels /a/, /i/, and / /. One
additional peculiarity of the form is that it may optionally appear as /u/
or l\fl:
(1) teddo
rigoteddu
riqu'to cook'
'meat'The u/xr form of the stem vowel -o was not often encountered in the speech
of my informants (though all accepted forms like those above); some
speakers never produced them. The one exception to the latter generalization occurred where the root vowel is /u/ or /\ff, in which case some verbs
in particular were habitually produced with the u/xr stem vowel:
(2) guuru
mükkü
nüürü
cxrddxr'to drive in (e.g. a nail)'
'to break off
'to make drowsy'
'to hunt'Other, apparently similar, verbs seldom if ever appeared with u/xr:(2) kxrttä
tükko
jxrkko'to blow on'
'to break'
'to play'
'to stop'In these cases, information about the preferred form of the stem vowel
(otherwise predictable for verbs) will have to be lexical. However, all
nouns with u/xr root vowels favor the u/xr stem vowel. Some, like gulu'pot'
were rejected when pronounced *gulo; others, like ödüku 'gun' and
mxrnxir were accepted with o/o, and even pronounced that way spontaneously on occasion, but the u/xr form was preferred.
See Sec. 5.1.2 for further discussion of the stem vowel.
2.8.3 Miscellaneous alternationsA few other alternations are attested. These are of minor significance,
affecting only single words:
(1)o/u 5t
al/o kwallo
a/
cammo
a/ye a-par'house'
'to steal (tr)'
'to eat (tr)'
'ten'üdi

Primary stress in Lango is invariably placed on the root vowel (underlined
vowels are stressed):6d5
äneni
mxrmjr
münni
äbolö
otitRoot
3d
rig'she scoops'
'meat'

'white man'
'white men'
'plaintain'
'fireny'mv
nru-n
boltitWhere the root is longer than one syllable — only possible in nouns —
the first vowel receives stress:
(2)makäc
doggolascissors
'door'Stressed vowels in Lango are somewhat louder and slightly longer than
unstressed vowels. The difference between stressed and unstressed vowels
is not as pronounced as in English; instead, the relation between them is
closer to that found in syllable timed languages such as Spanish.
Particles (e.g. the attributive particle ä, the subordinator ni), prepositions with noun objects, and certain prepositions following verbs are not
stressed. Instead, they cliticize to the adjacent stressed form:
(3) okobonl

In reduplicated words, stress is placed on the last, unreduplicated
syllable:Stress
(4) rärac
tütwal \

^In borrowed words, stress is placed either on the same syllable as in
the source language,
(5) m5t5ka'car'or, more commonly, on the penult:
(6) gab me n te
bulu'government'
'blue'In a few words ending in /!/, stress is placed on the last syllable:
(7) daktal
cukul'doctor'
'school'In compounds and NP's consisting of inalienable associative constructions, the root vowel of the rightmost word receives primary stress, the
root vowel of the other words receiving secondary stress (primary stress
is underlined once, secondary twice):
(8) dogwtpo
mouth bird
'bird's mouth'
pig abolo
juice plaintain
'plaintain juice'
rgyag mxirnvmeat cow whiteman
'European beef4. Tone
Lango is a tone language, exhibiting level tones, contour tones, and
downstep. In addition, there are a number of tone sandhi rules which may
have the effect of radically altering the underlying tonal contour of a word
in particular contexts.","[56, 57, 58, 59, 60]"
"8.3 Predicate nominal and predicate adjective constructions
Predicate nominal constructions normally consist of the subject followed
by the predicate nominal without a copula. The predicate nominal is inflected for subject agreement, taking, as one would expect on semantic
grounds, habitual aspect inflections:
(1)an ädäktälI ls-doctor-hab
'I'm a doctor'
(2)yin idäktälyou 2s-doctor-hab
'you're a doctor'
(3)däktälhe 3s-doctor-hab
'he's a doctor'
In response to a question such asPredicate nominal and adjective constructions
(4)145danö ijä?person who
'who's that?'
the response could be either
(5)en okelo
heO.'it's Okelo'
or
(6)okelo doO. part
'it's Okelo'
do is an affirmative particle indicating friendly assurance.
When a past time reference is indicated, the construction can be left
as in (1) through (3), with context or a time adverbial sufficing, be made
past with onwOQO, or, most likely, have bedo 'to sit, stay' conjugated in
the perfective functioning as a copula. In the latter case, the predicate
nominal no longer functions as syntactic predicate and therefore is not
inflected for subject agreement:
(1)an abedo daktalI ls-stay-perf doctor
was a doctor'
When a future time reference is indicated, bedo is also used, this time with
the binö periphrastic future:
(2)okelo binö bedo rwot
O. 3s-come-hab stay-infin king
Okelo will be king'When predicate nominale occur in contexts that syntactically require infinitives, bedo is obligatory:
(3)amttto bedo rwotls-want-prog stay-infin king
want to be king'
In identification sentences, the third person singular independent
pronoun en is frequently interposed between the subject and the predicate nominal when the predicate nominal has a definite interpretation:
(1)man en gwökk ä däkö ökwalöthis it dog att+part woman 3s-steal-perf
'this is the dog that the woman stole'
When the predicate nominal has an indefinite or generic interpretation,
en cannot be used:146The syntax of simple sentences
(2)man gwök
this 3s-dog-hab
'this is a dog'can be inserted even when the subject is not third person singular
(cf. Hebrew (Berman and Grosu 1976) and Wappo (Li and Thompson
1977)):
(3)an en adäktäl
I he ls-doctor-hab
am the doctor'Predicate nominals can be modified in the usual way (Sec. 9.2):
(1)an adäktäl ber
I ls-doctor-hab rel + part 3s-good-hab
am a good doctor'(2)rwöttä
he 3s-king-hab-lsa
'he is my king'Predicate adjectives, like predicate nominals, are inflected in the
habitual aspect, and do not require a copula when given a present time
significance:
(1)an äräc
I ls-bad-hab
am bad'(2)äjärjä rac
cat 3s-bad-hab
'the cat is bad'As with predicates nominals, onworjo or bedo can be used to indicate past
time reference (bedo being the most frequent):
(1)an onworjo äräc
I 3s-find-perf ls-bad-hab
was bad'(2)an abedo rac
1 ls-stay-perf bad
was bad'bedo is used in future contexts (with the bino periphrastic future) and in
contexts requiring an infinitive:
(1)an äbinö bedo räc
I ls-come-hab stay-infin bad
will be bad'Predicate nominal and adjective constructions(2)147an amxtto bedo rac
I ls-want-prog stay-infin bad
want to be bad'Notice that the adjective does not agree with the matrix subject (Sec. 5.4.1).
Predicate adjectives may also occur with doko 'to become':
(1)äläbä odoko dwdij
A. 3s-become-perf fat
'Alaba became fat'One quirk of adjectives, both predicate and attributive, is that they
sometimes require stem (synchronically idiosyncratic) changes when associated with a plural subject (or plural head):
(1)an äräcI ls-bad-hab
'I'm bad'
/ f\ \(2)S^S*.wan oracuwe lp-bad-hab
'we are bad'
See Sec. 5.4.2 for a discussion of these forms. No verb (or predicate
nominal) exhibits changes of this sort.
See Sec. 5.4.3 for the conjugation of adjectives and predicate nouns.","[160, 161, 162, 163]"
"The irregular H(L) class nouns634.5 The irregular H(L) class nouns
There are remarkably few irregularities with regard to the Lango tone
sandhi rules. The only notable irregularity involves a class of monosyllabic nouns whose citation forms have H but which behave tonally as
though they were HL. We will refer to these nouns as the H(L) nouns to
differentiate them from ordinary monosyllabic H nouns like d6g 'mouth'
and monosyllabic HL nouns like gwök 'dog'. A list of H(L) nouns follows:
(1)em
düd
tik
pirn
wök
tök'thigh'
'buttocks'
'chin'
'forehead'
'gap in teeth'
'nape'yit
yib

'tail'
'nose'
'tongue'
'breast, chest, middle'
'this'With the exception of man 'this', all H(L) words are body part nouns, and
ordinarily occur as heads of inalienable associative constructions (Sec.
8.7.2).
Compare the behavior in tone sandhi of the H noun dog 'mouth* and
the H(L) noun wum 'nose'. Despite the fact that both nouns have H in citation forms, wüm must be represented as HL underlyingly to account for
its behavior:

H(L) nouns differ from HL nouns in one further respect. When
alienable associative suffixes (Sec. 5.2.4, 8.7.2) are added to H(L) nouns,
they behave as though their tonal contours were H and not HL. Compare
the following:

lebba'my (animal) eye'
'my liver meat'
'my dog'
'my tongue meat'As the examples in (6) show, the H(L) noun leb behaves like the H
noun cwip, and not like the HL noun gwök, with alienable associative suffixes. This applies also to all the plural associative suffixes, whose form
does not vary with an alienable or inalienable interpretation. So, for example, for yit + wa Our tail' we have yiwa, not the expected yit'wa. This
contrasts with the regular behavior of HL nouns, where gwök+wä becomes gwok'wa.
A special rule, which we will refer to as H(L) Simplification [H(L)S],
applies to just the H(L) class when they are prepausal and when they are65The irregular H(L) class nounsfollowed by single alienable associative suffixes and alienable/inalienable

ordinary HL nouns. Inalienable associative suffixes have an underlying
high tone, as the following examples show:(8)warj+a

MORPHOLOGY5. The structure of Lango words
5.1 General considerations
5.1.1 RootsIn Lango as in other Lwo languages, roots are archetypically of the form
CiVC2- 47 Some roots lack GI or Cz, but, apart from the preposition i 'in'
and the attributive participle ä, no root lacks both GI and C2- There are
very few roots without GI, almost all of them basically verbal in sense.
Noun, adjective, and prepositional roots have inherent lexical tone,
though when nouns and adjectives are inflected for plurality, their tone
may change in synchronically unpredictable ways:
(1)SG
tag
jok
Ivtgwökdit
dworj
räcPL
togqi
J0g£
lüdi
gwoggi
dito
dogo
racu'spear'
'spirit'
'stick'
•dog'
'big, old'
•large'
'bad'For this and for some other reasons discussed below, both singular and
plural forms of these roots must be listed in the lexicon.
The tone of verbs - the effect of tone sandhi rules apart - is totally a
function of aspect and mood (Sec. 5.3.2). Intransitive infinitives, however,
have idiosyncratic tone (see Sec. 5.3.1) as do nominalizations (Sec. 5.2.1),
but the two are not always in agreement,
(2)kop
cam
pwop'speech'
'eating, food'
'teaching'kob
cem
pwöp'to speak (intr)'
'to eat (intr)'
'to teach (intr)'arguing against the assignment of lexical tone to the verbal root. Even
apart from tone, the form of both intransitive infinitives and nominalizations
is not predictable and so both must have their own lexical entries in any case.
5.1.2 The stem vowel
5.1.2.1 General characteristicsUnder conditions to be described in the sections below, Lango roots are
often followed by a 'stem vowel', a suffix which, as far as the modern70The structure ofLango wordslanguage is concerned, has no discernable meaning. Nonetheless, the
stem vowel is obligatory with certain roots and in certain grammatical
configurations. 49 The root plus the stem vowel together constitute the
'stem'. In the absence of a stem vowel, the stem, of course, consists only
of the root.
The usual form of the stem vowel is o/o, with harmonic peculiarities
discussed in Sec. 2.5.2:
(1)camm-6
dak-o
rem-0
rom-5
dit-o'to eat (tr)'
'woman'
'blood'
'sheep'
'big, old (pi)'The stem vowel may appear as u/vr, as discussed in Sec. 2.8.2:
(2)ρνη-ΐτ
duk-ύ
amur-ύ
rirj-ύ'pig'
'gun'
'leg'
'meat'
'lion'(also: d k-ό)
(also: riq-o)
(also: egat-o)Further, the stem vowel may be a copy of the root vowel:
(3)p ltid-ί
oker-έ
alib-ί
deb-e'knife'
'small'
'baby'
'beer pot'
'can'Finally, the stem vowel may be a/a or i/i. a/a is common with deverbal
nouns:
(4)digdw l-'strained beer'
'confusion'(< dig 'strain')
(< dwal 'confuse')i/i is often found with instruments:
(5)kwer-ί
pag-ί'hoe'
'main support post for a hut'Neither suffix, however, belongs exclusively to these classes:
(6)tul-a
bwo'r-ίOwl'
'eland'Nor are they required to express these notions:
(7)tarn
pal-'thought, idea'
'knife'(< tarn 'think')e/ε is uncommon as a stem vowel, being found always [?] either as a copy
of the root vowelGeneral considerations(8)oker-1'baby'or in borrowings:
(9)äreg-'distilled spirit'(< Arabic)While the back rounded stem vowels are more-or-less freely interchangeable (with some qualifications based on vowel harmony and idiosyncratic lexical selection), the others are not, neither with each other nor
with the back rounded set. That is, while a Lango speaker will accept either
rigo or riiju as meaning 'meat', he/she will not accept *rirja as having the
same meaning. It should be noted, though, that one does not find, rare
exceptions apart, different words from the same root which differ only in
stem vowel.
Stem vowels share a number of characteristics:
I.
II.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87]"
"288Endnotes154. This was discussed in Schachter 1974, where serial constructions were
argued to consist of a set of VP's following the common grammatical
subject and dominated by the S-node. (All known serial verb languages
are subject initial.)
155. Serial constructions could also develop from 'consecutive' constructions as suggested by Hyman 1971. Paratactic and consecutive constructions have a number of similarities. The Lango translations of Hyman's
consecutive are the paratactic and ti constructions.
156. Causative constructions like (3) can be shown to be paratactic in the
following way. First, the second clause may be independently negated and
second, may have a different subject from the first clause:

"Sec. 5.3.1 has an extensive list of Tr/SA and Tr/AN pairs.
94. See Barber 1975 for a discussion of active/middle versus active/passive
languages. Lango is clearly active/middle.
95. There are two sorts of exceptions to this. The middle has developed
an 'abilative' sense with a very few predicates. Some of these, e.g. wipere
'to be able to be heard', teile? 'to be able to be pulled, stretched', have
transitive counterparts as expected, wijipö 'to hear', tello 'to pull, stretch'.
But others do not, eg. binne7'to be able to come' has no transitive counterpart, only binö 'to come'.
The other exception is more idiosyncratic. The verb kwar) 'to swim'
has a counterpart with middle morphology, kwanere 'to swim', but no Tr
counterpart. Both kwaij and kwarjere can refer to the ordinary act of swimming, but if the body of water in which the swimming is done is mentioned,
only kwarjere can be used:
(1)locä okwagere i kuluniman 3s-swim-mid-perf in river-this
'the man swam in this river'
(2)*loc» ökwärj i kuluni282Endnotes96. As noted in endnote 69, the middle suffixes both derive from -re.
97. The meaning 'the ice was melted' would likely be translated with a
topicalization construction (Sec. 8.5.2), which involves moving the DO pe
'ice' to the beginning of the sentence. The verb is Tr, and is conjugated
in the third person singular:
(1)peomeoTrice 3s-melt-perf
'the ice was melted'
pe is a topicalized DO, and is not the subject (Sec. 8.5.2 and Noonan and
Bavin 1978b).
98. (2) is essentially equivalent to
(1)dako oc walo buk bota
Tr
woman 3s-send-perf book to-ls
'the woman sent the book to me'Notice that the -o ventive suffix differs from the usual first singular affix,
which involves the vowel a for Su, DO, possessive, and prepositional object uses.
99. An example of the anti-benefactive sense:
(1)otooya
3s-die-ben-perf-ls
'it died on me'SA-ben100. I speak of agreement here, though the forms considered might better
be viewed simply as bound pronouns since they seldom occur with independent forms, unlike Su inflections (see Sec. 8.7.6).
101. See Erteschik-Shir 1979 and Green 1974.
102. Givon 1979a, p. 524.
103. I will speak informally of movement in reference to topicalization.
This is a shorthand way of saying that the topic is interpreted as a
coreferential to the argument said to be moved to topic position. This
same shorthand will be applied in later sections to clefted NP's.
104. Noonan 1977.
105. Topicalization is subject to Ross' constraints. This is discussed in
Sec. 9.9.1Endnotes283106. See Creider 1977. The generalization given in the text is likely too
strong since I have recorded instances of right dislocation which do not
seem merely to be afterthought phenomena. For example, a sentence like
(1)όηέηέ gw k3s-see-perf-3so dog
'he saw the dog' (lit: 'he saw it, the dog')
the verb contains an object suffix interpreted as coreferential to the DO
gw k, unusual in Lango where the DO NP alone is normal. This structure
could be interpreted as containing a right dislocated NP whose trace in
the matrix is the object suffix. Pragmatically, the structure seems to be
used to insure a definite interpretation for gw k, which was being
reintroduced into the discourse from which this sentence was taken.
Without the object suffix, gw k could, in principle, be interpreted as a
new referent and assigned an indefinite interpretation. See Sec. 10.1 for
a discussion of how such situations are usually handled in Lango.

108. Noonan and Bavin 1978b.
109. See Noonan 1978 and Comrie 1977 for a discussion of the distinction between passive and impersonal constructions.
110. This construction resembles 'possessor promotion' reported from
Bantu (e.g. by Hyman 1977).
111. Chet Creider (pers. comm.) has pointed out to me that Western
Nilotic languages in general do not allow subject NP's to be questioned.
112. E.g. by Malandra 1955 and Crazzolara 1955. Notice that the gerunds
in this construction cannot be considered 'cognate objects' (cf. 'dream a
dream', etc) because intransitive as well as transitive verbs have gerunds
used in this way.
113. The general properties of each of these syntactic constructions is discussed in Noonan 1985.
114. Noun complements may be a product of English influence; I have
never encountered one in free discourse, but only as a translation of an
English sentence. Omondi (1982), however, discusses noun complements
in Dholuo at some length.

"ContrastContrast may be indicated by intonation alone, but this device is statistically less frequently employed in Lango than in English, clefting being
the preferred device. Generally speaking, contrast by intonation is used
for the purpose of maintaining parallel structure. For example, if A says
(1) rwot όηέηό okelo i poto
king 3s-see-perf O. in garden
'the king saw Okelo in the garden'
and Β believes that Ojuk, not Okello, was seen by the king, Β might retort
(2) rwot όηέηό ojxrk i poto
king 3s-see-perf O. in garden
'the king saw Ojuk in the garden'252Structures in discoursemaintaining the original sentence structure. (The underlined word is
given contrastive stress). However, the most likely response is (3), utilizing a cleft construction:
(3) ojxrk έη me rw t όηέηέ i p to
O. it rel+part king 3s-see-perf-3s in garden
'it's Ojuk that the king saw in the garden'
Any NP may be contrastively stressed or clefted.
When an object pronoun is in contrast an additional possibility, the
reinforced object construction, presents itself. Here the appropriate
pronoun follows the inflected verb:
Χ1νέ Λ\
1^Ί_>**
(4)
alaba
οηεηε* *εη
A. 3s-see-perf-3s him
'Alaba saw him'DirectionalityPronominalization in Lango is almost exclusively left-to-right anaphoric;
cataphoric reference seems always to be the result of afterthought, not
part of planned sentence construction as it may be in English. For instance,
(1) is perfectly acceptable in English:
(1) when he; got back, Ojuki ate
In Lango, however, the controller NP precedes the pronoun or inflected
verb:
(2)i kare ante oj-u-k odwogo, ti cemin time rel+part O. 3s-come+back-perf,
3s-and + then-hab eat-infin
'when Ojuk came back, he ate'10.2 Organizing events in discourse
In this section, I will discuss the mechanisms by which Lango marks sequential narration and non-sequential narration (simultaneity, repetition,
overlap, and lookback) in narrative discourse.
In particular, I will examine the three morphological aspects, the use of onworjo (Sec. 8.2.4) and
ϊ kare 'at the time, when' (Sec. 9.12.1), and the te construction (Sec. 9.6).
In many languages, the function of indicating sequential narration
is performed by the perfective aspect.
But in Lango, this function is
performed by the te construction, which indicates that there is no break
in the linear sequence of events in a narration. A narrative discourseOrganizing events in discourse253typically begins with a perfective, followed by a series of sentences with
te until a break in the narrative is reached. Sentences with te are interpreted as having the aspect of the inflected verb that precedes them,
despite the fact that te itself is inflected in the habitual aspect. Thus in
the discourse below, the te clauses are interpreted as perfective:
( 1 ) okelo od5k cen i bugO. 3s-go+back-perf back to forest
(2)te wot nekkö dyel ä qättoro3s-and+then-hab go-infin kill-infin goat att+part
person-indef
(3) te dwogo päco3s-and+then-hab come+back-infin home
Okelo went back to the forest. He went to kill
someone's goat, and then came back home'
A break in the narrative sequence can be accomplished by a clause which
repeats information already known. This function is frequently performed
by clauses headed by i käre:
(4)i käre äme odwogö pacoin time rel + part 3s-come+back-perf home
'when he got back home'
(4) repeats information contained in (3). Such repetitions are frequently
encountered in Lango narrative discourse and serve the function of marking off episodes, or sequences of sentences with a common theme. Notice
that the verb in (4) is perfective. (4) would ordinarily be followed by
another sequence of sentences with te, until the end of the new episode:
(5)te cämmo dyel3s-and + then-hab eat-infin goat
(6)te nino3s-and+then-hab sleep-infin
(7)i käre äm£in time rel+part 3s-sleep-perf
(8)te cakko kxrppo bur3s-and+then-hab start-infin dig-infin hole
'he ate the goat and then slept. After sleeping, he
started to dig a hole'
(7) is another repetition clause with i käre and the perfective, marking
off another episode. Such clauses almost always contain the perfective. (8)
continues the narration in the new episode.
The functions of the perfective, then include the introduction of discourses and episodes. The perfective is also used in an augmentative254Structures in discoursefunction, expanding on an event originally coded with te, usually for
dramatic effect. Such sentences do not advance the narrative. For example, (8) can be followed by (9) which serves this augmentative function:
(9) okxrpo, okvrpb3s-dig-perf, 3s-dig-perf
'he dug (it), he dug (it)'
In addition to the discourse continuity function with te and the new
episode and augmentative functions with the perfective (both typically
repetitive), there is the background function. Backgrounded material is
outside the mainstream of the narrative sequence, and expresses situations or states explaining motives, attitudes, and desires, or events which
are subsidiary (typically simultaneous with mainstram, in-sequence
events) or negative, that is, those expressing negative results. Any of the
three aspects may be used for backgrounded material. The perfective is
used to code susidiary events, the habitual is used for states, and the
progressive for unbounded activities (Sec. 8.2.4).
For instance, (9)
above may be followed by sentences expressing backgrounded material:
(10) ceq äryepsun 3s-shine-prog
(11) kwxrk ömäkesweat 3s-catch-perf-3s
(12) pe twero nworjrjoneg 3s-be + able-hab fmd-infin
(13) para onwOQo cireworries 3s-find-perf 3s-oppress-hab-3s
'the sun shone, and he started to sweat. He was not
able to find it, and worries beset him'
Notice that none of the above advances the narrative sequence — even
the perfective in (11), but rather thay help explain it and provide the detail
to flesh it out and make it interesting. The narrative might continue as
follows:
(14) okelo te tyekko kxrppD burO. 3s-and + then-hab finish-infin dig-infin hole
(15) te wot yeppo ojiirk3s-and + then-hab go-infin look-t-for-infin O.
Okelo then stopped digging the hole and went to look
for Ojuk'
Notice that the narrative sequence with te resumes immediately after the
augmentative and backgrounded material in (9-13).","[267, 268, 269, 270]"
"9.7 Conditional constructions
There are two ways to form conditional constructions in Lango. The first,
for ordinary conditionals, is to express the protasis in the indicativeCleft constructions233preceded by the conjunction kä 'if, and to express the apodosis with te if
it follows the protasis sequentially in time, or with the ordinary indicative
if it precedes the protasis in linear time sequence:
( 1 ) kä ica obinö te cemif man 3s-come-perf 3s-and+then-hab eat-infin
'if the man came, then he'll eat/he ate (after he came)'
(2) kä ic5 öbino, ocemoif man 3s-come-perf, 3s-eat-perf
'if the man came, then he had eaten (before he came)'
The second method is used for contrary-to-fact conditionals. With
these, both protasis and apodosis are preceded by kono. The verbs in both
clauses are in the ordinary indicative:
(3) kono onworjo atie i ccm, kono ämiyiif 3s-find-perf ls-be + present-hab with food, then
ls-give-perf-2s
'if I had food, I would have given it to you'
For kono conditionals, the order is always protasis first, apodosis
second. However, kä clauses may also follow the apodosis, though this is
much rarer in texts than the order protasis-apodosis. When the protasis
follows the apodosis, it may represent an afterthought:
(4)obinö tedo kä rwot obinölp-come-hab cook-infin if king 3s-come-perf
'we'll cook if the king comes'9.8 Cleft constructions
A sentence is a cleft sentence if it can be negated to mean that there is
something or someone satisfying the sentence other than the clefted (or
focused) NP. 132 Thus in English
(1) it's Irving that Zeke slapped
is a cleft because
(2) it's not Irving that Zeke slapped
presupposes that Zeke slapped someone and that someone is not Irving.
Lango has cleft sentences under this definition. These consist of the clefted
NP, followed by the third singular pronoun en, followed by a relative
clause. The relative clause consists of the fused attributive and relative
particles ame and the relativized sentence:234The syntax of complex sentences(1) okelo enn ame όρίό ojw to
Ο. it rel+part O. 3s-hit-perf
'it's Okelo that Opio hit'
The negation of (1),
(2) pe en okelo enn ame όρίό ojw to
neg he O. it rel+part O. 3s-hit-perf
'it's not Okelo that Opio hit'
presupposes that Opio hit someone other than Okelo.
The pragmatic effect of cleft is to establish a focussed item-in-contrast,
which is to say that in sentences like
(3)pi enn ante ojw to okelo
O. it rel+part 3s-hit-perf O.
'it's Opio that hit Okelo'the speaker believes that the hearer either has a finite set of persons in
mind and the speaker is indicating that, of this set, Opio is the relevant
one, or that the hearer believes that someone other than Opio hit Okelo
and the speaker is setting the hearer right. Cleft is also used as an answer
to questions such as (4):
(4) ij ojw to okelo?
who 3s-hit-perf O.
'who hit Okelo?'
Either (1) above or
(5) όρίό ojw to okelo
O. 3s-hit-perf O.
Opio hit Okelo'
with Opio receiving contrasting stress can answer (4). The cleft is far more
common in this function, however.
Since it is NP's, not nouns, that are clefted, nominal modifiers are
clefted along with their head nouns:
(1) loc» dw Q έη ante aj ga k o
man att + part 3s-big-hab it rel+part cat 3s-bite-perf
'it's the big man that the cat bit'
Associative NP's may be clefted without their head nouns:
(2) ogwag en ame gwo'kere okao rw t
O. it rel+part dog-3sa 3s-bite-perf king
'it's Ogwang whose dog bit the king'
The syntactic rules governing the relative clause in clefts are the same
as those governing ordinary relative clauses, e.g. the rules governing
resumptive pronouns,Cleft constructions235(3) däkö
ante rwöt önekke twöl
woman it rel+part king 3s-kill-ben-perf-3s snake
'it's the woman that the king killed the snake for'
and the rule governing the relative form of a third singular perfective
verb:(4) rwöt
ante önekö twöl
king it rel+part 3s-kill-perf snake
'it's the king that killed the snake'
(cf rwöt önekö twöl
king 3s-kill-perf snake
'the king killed the snake' )
The pronoundoes not refer to the clefted(1) atxnniand is invariable:äme däkö öpitöchild-this it rel+part woman 3s-feed-perf
'it's this child that the woman fed'
(2)itinoniante däkö öpitöchildren-this it rel+part woman 3s-feed-perf
'it's these children that the woman fed'
(3) anäme önenäI it rel+part 3s-see-perf-ls
'it's me that he saw'
is obligatory in clefts, except when the clefted
word,is an interrogative(1) rja ame loca önenö?who rel+part man 3s-see-perf
'who did the man see?'
or a pronoun:
(2) pe ynm ante ajwati
neg you rel+part ls-hit-perf-2s
'it's not you that I hit*
In such casesis optional; compare (2) and (3):(3) pe yin en ame ajwati
neg you it rel+part is-hit-perf-2s
'it's not you that I hit'
äme may be reduced to a or deleted altogether as in ordinary relatives:
(1) borpäme ödilö ni gigclothes it rel+part 3s-pack-perf part full
'it's the clothes that she packed to the rim'236The syntax of complex sentences
(2) böno enn a odilo ni git)
(3) bogo enn odilo ni git)As in relative clauses, aye may replace ame:
(4) loca/**»* X öneko gwök
Jman it rel+part 3s-kill-perf dog
'it's the man who killed the dog*
Notice that in Lango there is no ambiguity, even leaving aside intonation,
between an identification sentence, where the item identified is an NP
with a relative clause, and its corresponding cleft. Compare (4) with the
identification sentence (5):
(5) en loc» ame oneko gwökhe man rel+part 3s-kill-perf dog
'it's the man who killed the dog'
A pragmatically similar construction, the Lango equivalent of the
English pseudo-cleft, utilizes a more straightforward relative construction.
Here the focussed NP is in final position and the presupposed (backgrounded) material is a relative with an indefinite head occupying the subject slot in an identification sentence:
( 1 ) nätt ante oneko gwök ökelöperson rel-part 3s-kill-perf dog O.
'the one who killed the dog is Okelo'
There is typically a pause following the relative clause, but without the establishment of a new downdrift intonation contour.
Clefting and topicalization can both apply to the same sentence. In
such cases, the topic appears before the clefted NP:
(2) ökelö gwökäme ökäöO. dog it rel-part 3s-bite-perf
'it's the dog that Okelo was bitten by'
or Okelo, it's the dog that he was bitten by'
okelo is the topic, and gwök the clefted NP. The function of the topic, here
as elsewhere, is to establish the sentence orientation (Sec. 8.5.2): cleft establishes a focussed item-in-contrast. The two constructions, then, are not
operating at cross purposes and occur together naturally in discourse.
Notice that (2) cannot also mean 'it's the dog that Okelo bit' because then
the tonal contour on the verb would have to be okao, in accordance with
the rules for relativized subjects.","[248, 249, 250, 251, 252]"

milionAll other cardinal numbers are formed from combinations of the numbers

The numbers 1 through 10 have a prefix a-. It might seem that this
prefix is the attributive particle (or some combination including the attributive particle) now conventionally prefixed to these numerals. Regardless of its origin, it is now used even when these numerals are said in
isolation and when they are used as predicates: in neither case would one
expect the attributive particle.
6 through 9 were originally compounds:
(2)HSlä-bic # eel-^abic eelFS1-»70abic eel73In contemporary Lango, it would be impossible to derive the rest in any
straightforward fashion (8 in particular has an idiosyncratic base for 3).
Lango speakers, in any case, claim that these are unitary forms, not compounds.

"62. For convenience, these forms are treated here as nominal suffixes as
indeed they are in the majority of instance of their use. But these forms,
and the topicality affixes too, may attach to other parts of speech as well,
as discussed in Sec. 8.7.1. They are probably best considered NP final
clitics.
63. There are very few exceptions: kwiya 'to not know', yee 'to believe',
dagi 'to refuse, not want', and dokoro 'to cross over'. Some of the
peculiarities of these forms will be discussed below.
64. They represent tonally a contraction of the derived tone of the verb
stem in the perfective aspect.
65. It is perhaps worth demonstrating at this stage that the subjunctive
suffixes -i and -u are stem vowel replacements and do not have independent high tone. Recall that the tone for a disyllabic subjunctive is L H,
the latter being the stem vowel tone or, rather, the tone of its replacement. We have, then, forms likeEndnotes(1)277ogiki3s-stop-subj
'(that) he stop'
as well as
(2)ogik
3s-stop-subj
'(that) he stop'where -i has been deleted and its tone absorbed into the root. Now
consider:
(3)ogik*
3s-stop-subj-1 so
'(that) he stop me'Here the stem vowel tone is obligatorily absorbed into the root in the
presence of a pronominal object. Now compare (1) and (3): in (1) the -i
suffix bears the stem vowel tone so the root vowel is L. If -i had independent tone, like the pronominal object -ä, then we would expect instead
of (1) a form like
(4)ogikiwhere the root vowel bears the full subjunctive tonal contour LH. (4) is,
in fact, a grammatical form, but it cannot mean (1): it means instead '(that)
he stop you'. So, it seems clear that -i takes the stem vowel tone which
otherwise would have to be absorbed into the root vowel.
66. As this example shows, the benefactive may have an 'anti-benefactive'
sense. It in fact expresses the affected animate non-agent/non-patient.
For the /y/ in ötääyi, see Sec. 1.4.567. As noted in Sec. 5.3.2, binö is irregular.
68. See Sec. 1.5.1 for consonant changes associated with ventives.
69. Driberg (1923) distinguishes between a middle in -ere and a passive
in -e. (Since Driberg does not write tone or vowel quality, I'm assuming
his forms correspond in this way to the modern forms.) Neither my data
nor comparative data lend support to such a distinction.
The middle suffixes -ere and -e both derive historically from -re, a
reflexive suffix which developed from a noun meaning 'body' (cf. Shilluk
re 'body', pi rei).
Both suffixes might be taken to derive synchronically from /re/,
though this would require a couple of ad hoc rules.

(2)ber ni rwot omio loca dyär)3s-good-hab comp king 3s-give-perf man cow
'it's good that the king gave the man the cow'
Subject complements, even when extraposed, are unidiomatic in Lango
except in the case of modals like (1). The meaning of (2) would likely be
expressed by something like (3):
(3) yia yömrwot omio loca dyär]stomach-lsa 3s-soft-hab because + of it king 3s-give-perf
man cow
Tin glad that the king gave the man a cow'
Impersonal constructions like (1) and (2) are notably rare in Lango (see
Sec. 11.1); judgements are likely to be rendered personally, as in (3).
Noun complements are possible in Lango, though of infrequent occurence:
(1) rwot omio cxk ni äkwäl gwenoking 3s-give-perf order comp ls-steal-subj chicken
'the king gave an order that I steal the chicken'
(2) cik ä rwot ni äkwäl gwenö öyomo yiaorder att + part king comp ls-steal-subj chicken
'the king's order that I steal the chicken pleased me'
Sentences such as (2) are highly unnatural in Lango, judging by speakers'
reactions, and it is difficult to assess their grammatically. 114 As with verb
complements, noun complements are more natural when they occur last
in the sentence. The meaning of (2) would likely be rendered by a para tactic construction:
(3) rwot omia ni äkwäl gweno oyomo yiäking 3s-give-perf-ls comp ls-steal-subj chicken
3s-soften-perf stomach-lsa
the king ordered me to steal a chicken, it pleased me
'that the king ordered me to steal a chicken pleased me'
It is only in hypotactic complements that switch reference morphology is available (Sec. 9.3.2).
Relative clauses are also formed by means of subordination in
Lango. The relative clause follows the antecedent, or head, which is an
argument of the matrix clause. The details of the word order of relative clauses vis-ä-vis other members of the noun phrase was describedIntroduction193in Sec. 8.7.1. Relative clauses are usually preceded by the attributive
particle a and the particle me merged together as ante and referred to
as the relative particle. The complementizer ni is not used with relative clauses. Details of the syntax of relative clauses will be found in
Sec. 9.2.
Adverbials may also be formed with subordinate constructions. Their
syntax will be discussed in Section 2.9.","[207, 208, 209]"
"9.3 Complementation
9.3.1 Complement-typesComplementation is defined semantically as the state of affairs where a
predication functions as an argument of a predicate.
The predication
is referred to as a complement and the syntactic form it takes as its complement-type. Four complement-types are used in Lango: (hypotactic) indicative, (hypotactic) subjunctive, paratactic, and infinitive.
The indicative complement-type is used when the complement has independent time reference vis-a-vis the matrix:
(1)päkö okobbi dakö ni dyel ocamogirl 3s-say-ben-perf woman comp goat 3s-eat-perf
'the girl told the woman that the goat ate it'
(2) ätinni loca öpäjio pälächild 3s-see-perf comp man 3s-blunt-perf knife
'the child saw that the man blunted the knife'
(3) dakö opoyo ni edino kalwoman 3s-remember-perf comp 3s-thresh-perf millet
'the woman remembered that she threshed the millet'
(4)rwot binö tammo ni loci» ödök awo'roking 3s-come-hab think-infin comp man
3s-go+back-perf yesterday
'the king will think that the man went back yesterday'
N(5) ape aye ni okelo ocamo rec
/ f"" \**·AV ^· VVVVSls-neg ls-believe-hab comp O. 3s-eat-perf fish
don't believe that Okelo ate the fish'Complementation221By 'independent time reference' it is meant that the time reference of the
complement can vary freely relative to the time reference of the matrix,
and is in no way logically bound by the time reference of the complement
taking predicate. So in (4), the time reference of the matrix is future, but
the time reference of the complement is past. This situation could easily
be reversed:
(6) awo'ro rwot otamo ni loca bino dak
yesterday king 3s-think-perf comp man 3s-come-hab
go+back-infin
'yesterday, the king thought that the man will come back'
That is, there is nothing intrinsic in the meaning of tammo 'to think' that
requires that its complement have a certain time reference relative to it.
We can contrast this characteristic of tammo with mitto 'to want'. In sentences like
(7) rwot ämxtto ni loca dok
king 3s-want-prog comp man 3s-go+back-subj
'the king wants the man to go back'
the time reference of the complement can only be future relative to that
of the matrix. This is an instance of 'dependent' time reference, which
characterized the subjunctive and infinitive in Lango. The time reference
of a complement with dependent time reference is a necessary consequence of the meaning of the complement taking predicate. A complement having determined time reference typically refers to a future
world-state relative to the time reference of the complement-taking predicate (CTP). For example in the sentence
(1) Jose ordered Joäo to interrogate Smith
Joab's interrogation of Smith must necessarily follow Jose's order. That
is, the complement has a future time reference relative to the time
reference of the CTP order, even if both events, the order and the interrogation, took place in the past relative to the time of utterance of (1).
Josd could not, for example, order Joao to do something in the past relative to the act of ordering, thus ruling out a sentence like (2):
(2) Jose is ordering Joab to interrogate Smith yesterday
The range of determined time reference complements include those
whose time reference is necessarily the same as the complement taking
predicate, such as complements to phasal (or aspectual) predicates like
cakko 'to begin', those that are timeless in the sense that they represent general conditions or states, such as certain complements of määrö
'to like, love', and those that have no time reference because they represent non-events (as distinct from those that are simply potential) such
as certain complements -of temmo 'to try'. What all these have in common, of course, is that their time reference is determined by the mean-222The syntax of complex sentencesing and use of the complement taking predicate so that only one time
reference, the one determined by the complement taking predicate, is
possible for these complements. Complement taking predicates that
represent commands, requests, intention, desires, and expressions of
necessity, ability, or obligation are among those whose complements
have determined time reference. In contrast, complements with independent time reference include complements to predicates that assert,
report, comment on as background, or make truth-value judgements
about their complements.
So, the indicative is used as complements to utterance predicates like
kobbo 'to say', with prepositional attitude predicates like yee 'to believe'
and t ammo 'to think', with commentative (factive) predicates like bfer 'to
be good', and with predicates of knowledge such as qeeyo 'to know'.
The complementizer nl is obligatory with all indicative complements
(but see Sec. 9.3.3).
Paratactic complements were discussed in detail in Sec. 9.1.3.2. In sum,
the paratactic complement is used when the meaning of the complement
taking predicate and the complement is compatable with the two assertion aspect of parataxis. For the most part, paratactic complements have
determined time reference, since the conventions for interpreting the
temporal relations that hold between the two clauses representing events
in parataxis is to assume that their linear order represents their real time
order or that the two are simultaneous. This resembles the range of temporal relations possible with determined time reference. However, predicates like tammo 'to think' and qeey 'to believe' can under certain
circumstances be used in paratactic constructions, especially with first person singular subjects (see Sec. 9.1.3.2). Complements to these predicates
have independent time reference.
Paratactic complements occur with causative predicates like diiyo
'to press, force', immediate perception predicates like ηέηηό 'to see'
and wijijio 'to hear', phasal predicates like cakko 'to start', positive
achievement predicates like pooyo 'to remember', and positive propositional attitude predicates like tammo 'to think' when used assertively.
Subjunctive and infinitive complements both have determined time
reference. In addition, the subjunctive always has an interpretation that
can be described as 'indeterminate realization'. That is, in a sentence
containing a subjunctive complement, the action or state coded by the
subjunctive can not be inferred to have actually occurred. This is in
contrast to the paratactic complement, which always has a realized interpretation:
subjunctive
(1) rwot odio loc» ni oryetking 3s-press-perf man comp 3s-winnow-subj
'the king pressed the man to winnow'Complementation223para tactic(2) rwöt odio loca oryeto
king 3s-press-perf man 3s-winnow-perf
the king pressed the man, he winnowed millet
'the king forced the man to winnow'
In (2), one can infer that the man actually winnowed, but in (1), one cannot
make such an inference, though one cannot infer that the man didn't winnow either. The subjunctive is quite neutral in this regard. Similarly with
(3)onwoqo ämittö ni loca oryet3s-find-perf ls-want-prog comp man 3s-winnow-subj
wanted the man to winnow'
(4)onwoQO myero ni loca oryet3s-find-perf 3s-be + necessary-hab comp man
3s-winnow-subj
'it was necessary for the man to winnow'
one cannot infer that the man actually winnowed, though again, it's possible that he did.
The complementizer ni is obligatory with the subjunctive except for
two predicates, myeero 'to be necessary' and wekko 'to let, allow'. With
myeero its use is optional — compare (4) with (5):
(5)onworjo myerö loca oryet3s-find-perf 3s-be + necessary-hab man 3s-winnow-subj
'it was necessary for the man to winnow'
With wekko, ni is obligatory when the verb is used in its permissive sense,
(6) oweko ni okelo ocim
3s-allow-perf comp O. 3s-eat-subj
'he allowed Okelo to eat'
but can't be used when the verb is used to form non-third person imperatives:
(7) wik okelo oc£m
2s-let-imper O. 3s-eat subj
'let Okelo eat'
The subjunctive is used with desiderative predicates like mitto 'to
want', causative predicates like diiyo 'to press', and modal predicates like
myeero 'to be necessary'.
The infinitive, which has determined time reference, is used whenever
the logical subject of the complement is interpreted as coreferential to the
subject of the matrix:
(8) ämtttö binö
ls-want-prog come-infin
want to come'224The syntax of complex sentences(9) imxtto bind2s-want-prog come-infin
'you want to come'
(10) amitto bino
3s-want-prog come-infin
'he wants to come'
In determined time reference contexts, when the two subjects are not interpreted as coreferential, the subjunctive must be used:
(11) ämitto nx obinls-want-prog comp 3s-come-subj
want her to come'
It should be noted that the infinitive is not obligatory in (8-10). However,
if the subjunctive is used in such cases, it carries the implication that the
activity will be carried out with determination and resolve:
(12) amittö ni ab inls-want-prog comp ls-come-subj
want to come and am determined to do so'
Unlike English, coreference between the direct object and the complement subject does not result in an infinitive,
the subjunctive or
paratactic complement would be used instead, depending on the meaning. This is illustrated in sentences (1) and (2) above.
Depending on the meaning of the matrix predicate, the infinitive can
substitute for the paratactic complement under equi-subject conditions
without substantial change in meaning (or at least receive the same English
translation). For example,
(1) ätin öpöyö öjöbö kalchild 3s-remember-perf 3s-collect-perf millet
the child remembered it, she collected millet
'the child remembered to collect millet'
(2)ätin opoyojobbo kalchild 3s-remember-perf collect-infin millet
'the child remembered to collect millet'
(1) and (2) are roughly synonymous. But (3) and (4) carry very different
interpretations:
(3) ätin ötemö ojäbo kalchild 3s-try-perf 3s-collect-perf millet
the child tried it, she collected millet
'the child tried and succeeded to collect millet'Complementation225(4) ätin ötemö jöbbo kälchild 3s-try-perf collect-infin millet
'the child tried to collect millet'
(3) asserts that the child collected the millet, while with (4), there is an
invited inference that the child did not succeed in collecting the millet.
The infinitive can only paraphrase the paratactic complement if the
complement taking predicate has an implicative sense, that is if the
matrix predicate necessarily implies the truth of the complement. 131
Notice, however, that this paraphrase relation holds only when the
predicates are not negated. For example, (5) and (6) receive the same
English translation:
(5) ogwag ocako obücöO. 3s-start-perf 3s-yell-perf O.
Ogwang started it, he yelled at Opio
'Ogwang started to yell at Opio'
(6) ogwarj ocako bücco
. 3s-start-perf yell-infin O.
Ogwang started to yell at Opio'
But if ocako is negated, the paraphrase relation ceases. The sentence
<5') ogwäQ pe ocako öbücö öpiöO. neg. 3s-start-perf 3s-yell-perf O.
Ogwang didn't start it, he yelled at Opio
would have to receive an interpretation like Ogwang didn't start it, therefore he yelled at Opio' or something similar. (6') however, represents a
negation of the sense of the English gloss of (5) and (6),
(6') ogwarj pe ocako büccoO. neg 3s-start-perf yell-infin O.
Ogwang didn't start to yell at Opio'
and clearly is not synonymous with (5').
Serial constructions can be embedded as infinitives, but paratactic constructions can not (Sec. 9.1.4).
The infinitive is used with a large range of predicates all with the
coreference conditions described above. It is found with modals like tweero
'to be able', achievement predicates like temmo 'to try' and pooyo 'to
remember', and aspectuals like cakko 'to start, begin'.
9.3.2 Switch referenceIn hypotactic complements (indicative and subjunctive), the ordinary third
person subject affixes assume a new function. They are used to indicate that226The syntax of complex sentencesthe subject of the complement is not the same as the subject of the matrix:
( 1 ) rwot okobo ni oneko abworking 3s-say-perf comp 3s-kill-perf lion
'the king said that he killed the lion'
In (1), king and he cannot refer to the same individual. Notice that the form
of the verb in the complement is the same as it would be as the main verb
in a sentence:
(2) oneko abwor
3s-kill-perf lion
'he killed the lion'
The ordinary third person forms are said to have 'switch-reference' function in hypotactic complements. If, however, it is intended that the subject of the matrix and the subject of the complement are coreferential,
then special 'non-switch reference' affixes are used:
(3) rwot okobo ni eneko abworking 3s-say-perf comp 3s-kill-perf lion
'the king said that he killed the lion'
In (3), king and he must refer to the same individual. There is also a third
person plural non-switch reference affix:
(1) gr ötämo ni orjeo däkonothey 3p-think-perf comp 3p-know-hab woman-that
'they thought that they (someone else) knew that
woman'
(2)gi otamo ni irjeo däkonothey 3p-think-perf comp 3p-know-hab woman-that
'they thought that they (themselves) knew that woman'
For the form of switch reference inflections, see Sec. 8.2.5.
The switch/non-switch reference distinction is available only for
hypotactic complements. It is not available for paratactic constructions,
serials, relative or adverbial clauses, or for adjacent sentences in discourse.
9.3.3 Embedded questionsYes/no questions can be embedded as complements; they appear in the indicative mood and the usual complementizer ni is replaced by kä 'if, which
can be translated here also by 'whether':
(1) apepo däkö kä rwot obüco apwöpls-ask-perf woman if king 3s-yell-perf teacher
asked the woman if the king yelled at the teacher'Complementation227(2) däkö pärö äpärä kä pakö öregö käl
woman 3s-consider-hab consider-ger if girl 3s-grind-perf
millet
'the woman doubts whether the girl ground the millet'
Information questions can also be embedded. In such cases the interrogative word is moved to the front of the embedded question in a cleft construction, replacing the complementizers ni or kä:
( 1 ) pe äneö äwene en atyekko xyeneg ls-know-hab when it ls-finish-prog in-3s
don't know when I'll finish it'
This information can also be expressed as in (2):
(2) pe arjeo kare ame atyekko iye
neg ls-know-hab time rel-part ls-finish-prog in-3s
don't know when I'll finish it'
9.3.4 Direct and indirect speech
Lango makes no formal distinction between direct and indirect speech.
Both use the complementizer ni. Further, there is no rule analogous to a
sequence-of-tense rule. The two are only distinguishable by change in
shifter elements such as locative and person indicators:
direct
(1)ököbö ni aketo pä la kän3s-say-perf comp ls-put-perf knife here
'he said, ""I put the knife here""'
indirect(2) ököbö ni eketö pala kxrnxr
3s-say-perf comp 3s-put-perf knife there
'he said that he put the knife there'
In expressing 'future in the past', the ordinary devices for referring to the
future are used:
(3) ögwärj oköbö ni ebino d5k
O. 3s-say-perf comp 3s-come-hab go+back-infin
Ogwang said that he would/will go back'
ököbö 'he said' may be contracted with the complementizer ni to produce
ököbbi.","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243]"
"4.4 Tone sandhi
4.4.1 General principlesOne remarkable characteristic of tone sandhi in Lango is that, with almost
no exceptions (Sec. 4.5), the underlying arrangement of highs and lows is
preserved without loss despite considerable changes in the association
links between tone and segment. Under certain conditions, underlying L's
may surface as downstep on an adjacent H, but this is really the only disruption of the tonal contour (and a relatively minor one since a signals
the presence, either synchronically or diachronically, of a L).
As an example of what the above means, consider the following:
(1)ögwäg
-+
see-imper merekatnen ogwärj'look at the merekat!'
On the left is the underlying tonal pattern corresponding, in this case, to
how each word would be said in isolation. On the right is the actual pronunciation which results from applying the tone sandhi rules to the underlying pattern. In order to make more apparent what has happened during
the course of the derivation, we will make use of some of the conventions
of autosegmental tone analysis, "" according to which tone is regarded as
an independent layer or tier associated with the segmental level by general
principles and language specific rules. In our adaptation of this approach,
(1) is represented as (2):
(2)LHLV /\nen ogwagL
-»HLVogwärjIn examining (2), we see that while the association between tone and segment undergoes considerable change, the basic L H L pattern remains undisturbed. Autosegmental analysis makes this aspect of the tone sandhi
rules much clearer.",[65]
"Pronouns1095.6.3 Asociative pronouns: independent forms
The affixal associative pronouns are discussed in Sec. 5.2.4.
The independent associative pronouns, i.e. free-standing forms, are
in origin prepositional phrases based on the preposition me 'for' conjugated for person. In the singular, these associatives are exactly like the
conjugated forms of the preposition (see Sec. 5.5), but they differ in having
a separate plural paradigm used to agree with plural antecedents:
mera
meri
merePL
mega
megi
megemewa
mewu
megimegwa
megwu
meggxSG(1)'mine'
'yours (sg)'
'his, hers,
its'
Ours'
'yours (pi)'
'theirs'These forms are used in constructions like:
(2)man 'mera
this mine
'this is mine'
magi 'mega
these mine
'these are mine'The singular forms are sometimes used in place of the plurals.
See Sec. 8.4 for the syntax of these forms.
5.6.4 Interrogative pronouns
The syntax of the interrogative pronouns is discussed in Sec. 8.9.
The interrogative pronouns, like other pronouns in Lango, distinguish
singular and plural forms:
(1)SG
'who'rja'what'
'which'noPLmeneThe plural is formed by suffixing the 3p associative (or object) suffix -gi
onto the singular forms, mene has no plural counterpart and can be used
to refer to either humans or non-humans. It follows the nouns it modifies
and does not occur with the attributive particle a, differentiating mene
from ordinary adjectives:110The structure ofLango words(2)ätin

"174The syntax of simple sentencesAs a noun modifier, it may function either as an independent word or
as an enclitic. In the latter case, the initial /m/ is subject to cluster
simplification (Sec. 1.2.3):
(3)kül
?
warthog which
'which warthog?'","[189, 190]"
"138The syntax of simple sentencesThe characteristics of the aspects are summarized below:
perfectiveprogressivenon-dura live/
boundedhabitualdurative/unboundedapplicative/processattributive/
non-processOut of context, the perfective will be assigned a past interpretation,
the habitual a present, and the progressive either a present or future.
These interpretations are purely pragmatically based, and it is important
to emphasize that these aspects have no intrinsic tense. They can be assigned any tense with which they are semantically compatible. The
progressive and the habitual can, in the appropriate discourse context, be
assigned a past, present, or future interpretation. The perfective cannot
on logical grounds be assigned a present interpretation, but may receive
a past or future interpretation. Of course, a particular temporal interpretation for any of the aspects can be insured through use of the appropriate temporal adverbial, e.g. cwäji 'long ago', diki 'tomorrow', etc.
The discourse use of the aspects will be taken up in Section 3.2.
A number of auxiliary verbs can be used to create definite tense interpretations. A syntactically unique construction is formed with the 3s perfective of Tr nworjrjo 'to find'. In this construction, the verb onworjo 'he,
she, it found it' is typically placed initially in the sentence — though it may,
as in (1) below, be preceded by a topicalized NP — and is always conjugated
in the 3s perfective regardless of the person or aspect of the main verb:
(1)an onworjo abwöteI 3s-find-perf ls-deceive-perf-3s
had deceived him'
(2)önwörjö loc» acem
3s-find-perf man 3s-eat-prog
'the man was eating'(3)onworjo äkwänö i leb lärjö
3s-find-perf ls-study-hab in tongue Lango
used to study Lango'With the progressive and the habitual, onworjo results in a simple past.
With the perfective, the interpretation is of a secondary or relative past
analogous to the English past perfect. The onworjo construction resembles
in certain respects the paratactic construction (Sec. 9.1.3) in that there are
two fully inflected verbs juxtaposed, but differs in certain crucial respects,
for instance in meaning, in the possibility for a nominal subject for the
second clause, etc.
Two other verbs may be used as auxiliaries to indicate future, binö 'to
come' conjugated in the habitual aspect forms a simple future with theVerbal complex139semantic main verb in the infinitive:
(1)bino cem
3s-come-hab eat-infin
'he'll eat'With the progressive and perfective aspects, a motional or ingressive sense
is added. The progressive retains a future connotation, while bino in the
perfective yields a perfect or secondary past:
(2)abino cem
3s-come-prog eat-infin
'he'll come to eat'(3)obi no cem3s-come-perf eat-infin
'he's come to eat'
The verb mitto 'to want' forms an immediate future, again with the semantic main verb in the infinitive:
(4)mitö cem
3s-want-hab eat-infin
'he's about to eat'In this construction, mitto is always conjugated in the habitual. When
mitto is used to express desire, it is conjugated in the progressive:(5)amittö cem
ls-want-prog eat-infin
want to eat'A special truncated form of bino 'to come' without the final -o also
figures as an auxiliary verb. This form is always conjugated in the perfective aspect and is followed by the semantic main verb also conjugated in
the perfective. It functions to mark contrastive affirmatives (like English
do) in the non-recent past:
(1)an abin akwalo gwenö
I ls-come-perf ls-steal-perf chicken
did steal the chicken'(1) takes the form of a serial construction (Sec. 9.1.4).
The verb tie 'to be present' conjugated in the habitual in a paratactic
construction followed by the semantic main verb in the progressive functions to emphasize the in-process nature of the progressive:
(1)onwönp tie aöyö mac3s-find-perf 3s-be-l-present-hab 3s-warm-prog fire
'he was warming himself by the fire'
This construction is used in certain set expressions such as:140The syntax of simple sentences(2)kec tie anekke tutwal

are prefixes and are obligatory for all verbs inflected for aspect and for
the subjunctive. The infinitive is inflected neither for aspect nor for subject. Subject inflections for the three aspects were illustrated in Sec. 8.2.4
All remaining verb agreement affixes are suffixes.
The verb is inflected for one additional argument, though which argument will trigger verb agreement depends on the stem used and the
valence of the verb.
If a benefactive stem is used, only the benefactive
can trigger agreement:
(1)okella
3s-bring-ben-perf-ls
'he brought it back for me'(2)ädökki
ls-go+back-ben-perf-2s
went back for your sake'With a transitive stem, a non-human 3s direct object does not trigger
agreement — the stem itself marked as transitive is sufficient. Sentence
(1) above with a transitive benefactive stem illustrates this. In addition,
nominal DO's and lO's do not trigger agreement; instead the plain transitive stem is used. With non-benefactive stems, either pronomial DO's or
lO's may trigger agreement. They are not distinguishable from the
benefactive because of the stem difference. Compare (3) with (1) above:
(3)okela
3s-bring-perf-ls
'he brought me'DO's trigger agreement preferentially over lO's; if both have human
referents and are pronomialized, the DO will agree with the verb and the
IO will be an object of bot 'to':
(4)rwot ocwale botaking 3s-send-perf-3s to-Is
'the king sent him to me'
Sentences with a pronomial DO (other than a non-human 3s) and a
benefactive argument are avoided — independent pronouns are very rare
in postverbal position and are not used without a coreferential inflection
on a verb or preposition (Sec. 8.7.6).
Infinitives are inflected for benefactive, DO, and IO arguments in the
same manner as verbs.
A list of DO inflections is given below; IO inflections are identical:142The syntax of simple sentencesόηέηό lyec

A small number of particles, including pe 'not', mom (~ mam) 'not',
and pwod (~ pud) 'still, just' can take suject agreement in addition to
the subject agreement on the main verb. These forms always take
habitual subject prefixes regardless of the aspect of the accompanying
verb:

(4) represents an emphatic denial. This agreement is also found when
there are a number of preverbal particles, as in (2) above.
The reason these particles and not others take subject agreement is
that all three are derived from verbs, pe and mom also function as negative existential predicates meaning 'to not exist, not be present* (Sec 8.4).
pwod seems to be derived from a verb also: pwvddvr 'to give sparingly'.","[153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159]"
"9.4 Comparative constructions
The equative relation can be indicated in two ways. The first involves bälä
'as, like':
(1) däkoni ber bälä yin
woman-this 3s-beautiful-hab as you
'this woman is as beautiful as you'
The second clause in (1) has been truncated, the second predicate ibir
'you are beautiful' having been ellipted. bälä is a conjunction; as the example shows, it is not conjugated like simple prepositions.
The other technique for indicating the equative relation involves
serialization (Sec. 9.1.4) with the verb cällo 'to resemble' as the second
verb in the series:
(2) däkoni ber ca'H
woman-this 3s-beautiful-hab 3s-resemble-hab-2s
'this woman is as beautiful as you'
(3) däkoni pe ber ce'li
woman-this neg 3s-beautiful-hab 3s-resemble-hab-2s
'this woman isn't as beautiful as you'
(4) aber äca'li
1 s-beautiful-hab l s-resemble-hab-2s
'I'm as beautiful as you'Comparative constructions229Simple comparison may be indicated by means of serialization too.
The first verb in the series establishes the standard; the second verb, katto
'to surpass' or looyo 'to defeat, exceed', the item compared:
(1) äryekäka'ti
ls-clever-hab ls-surpass-hab-2s
'I'm cleverer than you'
(2) däko pe dwog kätö icS
woman neg ls-big-hab 3s-surpass-hab man
'the woman isn't bigger than the man'
(3) itikiloorwot
2s-strong-hab 2s-exceed-hab king
'you're stronger than the king'
Simple comparison can also be indicated by a non-serial construction, still
utilizing loayo or katto. The standard of comparison is a nominal object
of the preposition i:
(4) dako 155 ic5 i dwög
woman 3s-exceed-hab man in bigness
'the woman is bigger than the man'
There is no special superlative construction. The superlative is simply
a comparative where comparison is made to the relevant class of entities:
(5) lyeci d5n5 0155 i kin leyi
elephants 3p-big-hab 3p-exceed-hab in middle animals
'elephants are the biggest animal'
(6) Mohammed AH en tek 155 i wi lobo
M.A. he 3s-strong-hab 3s-exceed-hab in head world
'Mohammed Ali is the strongest in the world'
Notice that looyo in (5) and (6) is morphologically transitive, just as in (3).
Adjectives may also be used to compare clauses. In such cases the
clauses are nominalized:
(1) cämmö gwennä okelo oyotoyot 155 kwällogi äeat-infin chickens att+part O. fast 3s-exceed-hab
steal-infin-3p att+part O.
Okelo eats chickens faster than Opio steals them'
When two clauses are compared directly, only the second is a nominal:
xv^ 1 1^
'
' A 1
H ^
^
s
^ A
okelo
camo
gwen l193
kwallogi
a opxoO. 3s-eat-hab chickens 3s-exceed-hab
steal-infm-3p att+part O.
Okelo eats more chickens than Opio steals'230The syntax of complex sentences9.5 Ingressive constructions
wot 'to go, walk' and other motion verbs are often used pleonastically in
a serial construction resulting in an ingressive construction. In this construction, wot often retains a motional sense, but its primary function
seems to be to reinforce perfective aspect — it is never found in the
progressive or habitual aspects:
( 1 ) loca owoto olvb5 dakoman 3s-go-perf 3s-follow-perf woman
'the man followed the woman'
(2) d k owoto okwano
woman 3s-go-perf 3s-read-perf
'the woman read'
As a serial construction, the ingressive can also take the form of an infinitive
(3)mitto wot yepp cem
ls-want-prog go-infin look + for-infin food
Ί want to go look for food'or subjunctive:
(4)mitto ηί όρχό ow t oyep cem
ls-want-prog comp O. 3s-go-subj 3s-look + for-subj food
Ί want Opio to go look for food'9.6 Coordinating sentences
As noted in Sections 8.7.5 and 9.1.2, Lango makes little use of true conjunction relative to English, because while ento 'but' and ορό Or' can be
analyzed as true conjunctions (though the verbal status of όρο is quite
clear), there is no Lango equivalent of English 'and'.
The 'and' relation is expressed in Lango in a number of ways depending on the sense. If mere, non-sequential conjunction is intended, simple
juxtaposition of sentences is used:
( 1 ) rwot cam rirjo. en m t k rpking 3s-eat-hab meat, he 3s-drink-hab beer
'the king eats meat and drinks beer'
If simultaneity is indicated, a paratactic construction is frequently encountered involving repetition of each predicate:Coordinating sentences231(2) rwöt onwono cemö mato cemo matoking 3s-find-perf 3s-eat-hab 3s-drink-hab 3s-eat-hab
3s-drink-hab
'the king ate and drank'
Other sorts of 'and' relations may also be accomplished with parataxis
(Sec. 9.1.3).
When sequence is indicated (i.e. when 'and' is equivalent to 'and then'),
a special syntagm, the t£ construction, is used, te is a verb, is always conjugated in the habitual aspect, and takes the semantic main predicate as
its infinitive complement:
(1) an atedo rirjo ate cammoI ls-cook-perf meat ls-and+then-hab eat-infin
cooked the meat and then I ate it'
te constructions never begin a discourse and are always interpreted as
having the aspect of the inflected verb preceding them. The function of
the te construction is to advance the narrative, indicating continuity in the
linear sequence.
Intonationally, te constructions can either function as an intonational adjunct of the first clause, as in parataxis, or as a completely
separate unit:
(2) obi no te cammo3s-come-perf 3s-and+then -hab eat-infin
'he came and then he ate'
(3) lanö öyä i Sudan, ote bino te gik gülu
L. 3s-go-perf from S. 3p-and+then-hab come-infin3p-and+then-hab stop-infin G.
'The Lango came from the Sudan. They came and
stopped at Gulu'
(2) is an example of the two clauses functioning intonationally as a single
sentence. (3) illustrates both possibilities. Generally speaking, the shorter
the first clause, the more likely the second is to form an intonational unit
with it. Except in conditional constructions, changes in topic always result
in a new intonational unit:
(4) kwäc ocako cem. apwo te nekkeL. 3s-start-perf eat-infin. H. 3s-and+then-hab
kill-infin-3s
'Leopard started to eat. Then Hare killed him'
te constructions may even begin new episodes in discourse provided the
narrative order is not disturbed (Sec. 10.2).
te may be negated,232The syntax of complex sentences(5) loca obino paco pe te
ätin
man 3s-come-perf home neg 3s-and+then-hab see-infin child
'the man came home but didn't see the child'
and may occur with a time adverbial (provided it does not disturb the narrative sequence):
(6) i dikkomere gin ducu öte bind rwatte
in morning-topic they all 3p-and + then-hab come-infin
meet-mid-infin
'that morning they all came to meet'
te constructions can also occur in disjunction with:(7) kä ötwo, ite dinno öjio ite öddo äoda
if 3s-dry-perf, 2s-and+then-hab thresh-infin or
2s-and+then-hab pound-infm pound-ger
'if it dries, you either thresh it or pound it'
In the above example, the second ite can be deleted.
Serial constructions can be coded in narrative discourse with te; the
verbs in the series all appear in the infinitive:
(1) te wot nwOQQO ojxrk3s-and+then-hab go-infin find-infin O.
'then he went to find Ojuk'
With paratactic constructions, however, each clause must either occur in
a separate te construction,
(2) te diiyo okelo, te kopjia ögwärj
3s-and+then-hab press-infin O., 3s-and+then-hab
help-infin O.
'and then he forced Okelo to help Ogwang'
or the first clause only is formed with te, the second clause taking the form
it usually would in a paratactic construction:
(3) te diiyö okelo okopa ogwäq
3s-and+then-hab press-infin O. 3s-help-perf O.
'and then he forced Okelo to help Ogwang'
Conjunction reduction in Lango can only result in conjoined NP's (Sec.
8.7.5). There is no rule of gapping or object reduction in Lango.","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248]"
"Endnotes285122. They can also be used with geeyo 'to believe' and similar predicates,
but here a paratactic construction rather than a subordinate one is much
preferred:
(1)ärjeö ökelö odxö okwänls-believe-hab O. 3s-press-perf O. 3s-read-perf
I believe it, Okelo pressed Opio, he read
believe Okelo pressed Opio to read'

this and similar sentences.
124. For general discussions of serial constructions in African languages,
see Stahlke 1970, Welmers 1973.
125. Exceptions have been noted by Bambose 1974 p.27, though it remains
to be seen whether the example he cites from Izi is really serial. Since the
distinction between serial and paratactic constructions has not previously
been made, it's possible that at least some examples described in the literature as serial may turn out to be paratactic.

128. Ross 1967. Chet Creider has pointed out to me that other Nilotic languages do not obey the Complex NP Constraint. The crucial cases involve
sentences like the following,

man 3s-steal-perf chicken rel+part king 3s-hit-perf
woman rel+part 3s-cook-perf
'the man stole the chicken that the king hit the woman
who cooked'which my informants rejected. I concede that their rejection of this sentence may reflect the influence of English on my informants'judgements.
I have never recorded a sentence in free speech which violated the CNPC,
however.

reduction and gapping, but not on content, as in parallel structures.
151. See Noonan 1985 for a detailed discussion of ways matrix verbs can
affect the interpretation of subordinate predications in complementation.
152. I have in mind here semantic factors like the meanings of complement taking predicates which impose interpretations on their complements; complement taking predicates function as plugs, holes, and
filters (Karttunen 1973) allowing or preventing the percolating upward
of presupposition associated with complements, etc.
153. Givon 1979 speculates on the origin of subordination in coordination, an idea with a long history in linguistics (see for example Br0ndal
1952). Parallel structures as represented by parataxis could be interpreted
as a stage in this process — semantically still like coordinate structures
but developing syntactic properties like subordinate structures. Serialization can be seen as a further step in this process — see below.","[302, 303]"
"1.4.2 IntervocalicMost Lango verb roots are of the form Ci(G)VC2 (Sec. 5.1.1). C2 can occur
word finally or intervocalically, in geminated or non-geminated form,
depending on which part of the verbal paradigm we consider:
/ted/'cook'
[te«d]
[Tatodo]
[ted«o]'cook it!'
Ί cooked it'
'to cook it'In Sec. 1.2.1, it was noted that [η] does not occur in environment C,
that is, it does not occur intervocalically except root initially — we find
no [q] corresponding to the [d] in [Tatedo] above. When the morphophoneme /n/ is €2 and appears in non-geminated form in environment
C, the flanking vowels are nasalized and the /q/ itself is deleted:
/gen/'prevent'
[g£»n]
[Tageo]
[g£q»o]'prevent it!'
Ί prevented it'
'to prevent it'Vowels are regularly nasalized before and after nasal stops, but the
nasalization in [7ageo] is more pronounced than the slight nasalization
in the corresponding vowels in [geq»o] or [g6«q].
In nouns also, fully nasalized vowels alternate with [n]:
[cfq]
[c5q]
[n5q]
[ty q]'hand'
'knee'
'crocodile'
'durra stalk't c ^f]
[coe]
[P^e]
[tyi>£]'hands'
'knees'
'crocodiles'
'durra stalks'In nouns and verbs like those given above, there is little difficulty in17Other morphophonemic processespositing a morphophoneme /rj/: / / is deleted in environment C when nongeminate; the flanking vowels are fully nasalized.13 There are instances
of fully nasalized vowels, however, where there is no alternation with [ ]:
'morning sun'
^ 'near'
[?og-£ra-]
[?ora""a-] 'sterile (of a young woman)'
In such cases, there is always a sequence of two nasal vowels, each of which
constitutes a separate syllable, i.e. there is always a sequence like:V $V
In fact, fully nasal vowels do not occur in Lango except in V $ V pairs. It
is always possible, then, to posit a morphophonemic / / in such words,
catching a free-ride on the nasalization and -deletion rules. In morphophonemic transcriptions, /rj/ will be written in such words:

In slow deliberate speech no assimilation need take place in external
sandhi; in fast tempo, assimilation is possible in other syntactic environments.
Word final non-nasal stops and affricates preceding the attributive
particle a are devoiced and, as noted in Sec. 1.2.3, geminated — the latter applying to all final consonants including nasals:cf/pig ä däko/

closely related Acholi.","[32, 33, 34]"

some paradigms illustrating this affixation. All verbs are 3s habitual:

kelliwu).
In the subjunctive benefactive, both -i and -u are deleted, their tones
absorbed into the root and C2, as usual for benefactives, is geminated:
(3)okellx
3s-bring-subj-ben
'(that) he bring it for'(Recall that the tone sandhirule HSl is blocked by gemination (Sec. 4.4.2),
so we do not get *okelli.) Pronominal objects are affixed normally:
(4)äkelli
ls-bring-subj-ben-2so
'(that) I bring it for you'
akelligi
ls-bring-subj-ben-3po
'(that) I bring it for them'The ventive suffix is -o. Before it the stem vowel deletes, its tone is
absorbed by the root, and C2 geminates, -o conditions regressive vowel
harmony on the root.
Ventives can be constructed from transitives or intransitives, but100The structure of Lango wordsthey do not take pronominal suffixes, nor are benefactive ventives possible. When the sense requires either objects or benefactives, ventives
are usually avoided, but if they are used, independent pronouns or
prepositional phrases are used to supply the additional argument:

idiosyncratic meanings. As a further example, consider:

The meaning and use of the middle voice is discussed in Sec. 8.2.2.
There are two middle voice suffixes: -fi, which geminates C2 of the
root, and -ere, which does not. -έ is suffixed to roots whose C2 is alveolar
or /y/; -ere is used in all other cases:69

The subjunctive suffixes -i and -u delete before the middle voice affixes,
their tone being absorbed into the root.
Both transitive and intransitive verbs have middle voice counterparts.
5.3.5 Gerunds
The syntax and meaning of the gerund is discussed in Sec. 8.10 and 9.1.5.
The formation of the gerund is quite straightforward: a root — either
transitive, intransitive, or adjectival — is assigned a H tone and prefixed
with ä- and suffixed with -ä. The latter harmonizes with the root:
(1)Root
ted
nek
mat
cam
wot
to
her
keg'cook'
'kill'
'drink, smoke,
get beat up'
'eat'
'go, walk'
'die'
'good'
'thin'Gerund
ateda
aneka
amatä
acamä
äwotä
atoä
äberä
akega(Recall that adjective roots, unlike verbal roots, have underlying tone.)
When an adjective has a stem vowel, the stem vowel is lost in forming the
gerund:
(2)bwogo
tidi'young, unripe'
'small'abwoga
ätida™The underlying tone of the suffix must be L, the H L resulting from
HS1. The proof of this is that if the falling tone were lexical, it would undergo UFS in words like
/o \
(3)N'
^
'
acama-na
eat-ger-lsa
'my eating'which are pronounced acamana not *äcäma'na, which is what one would
expect if the suffix were *-a and the HL simplified via UFS.
Associative affixes with gerunds present no special difficulties.","[114, 115, 116, 117, 118]"
"5.2 Nouns
5.2.1 Deverbal and deadjectival nounsThere are several morphological classes of nominalizations in Lango. In
general, the connection between form class and meaning seems arbitrary
from the standpoint of the modern language.
I. The nominalization consists of the bare verbal or adjectival root. In
deadjectival nouns, the tone is the same as the adjective. In deverbal
nouns, the tone is not predictable from the verb, even from the tone of
intransitive infinitives, which themselves have idiosyncratic tone. (When
two verbs are given, the first is transitive, the second intransitive.)

rules which remains to be discussed, namely the fact that geminate consonants block the application of the three tone spreading rules: HSl, HS2,
and LS. Consider first HSl: given an underlying L followed by a H, HSl
would be expected to apply converting the L to LH (if the L were word
final), as we see in the following:Tone60(1)H LA 1HSlguluniHL
/N
gulunipot-this
'this pot'However, if a geminate consonant intervenes, the high tone is not spread.
In the following example, when -ni is suffixed to rec 'fish', cluster
simplification converts the /en/ cluster to fee/ (Sec. 1.2.3). HSl is then
prevented from applying:
(2)H LcsI I
recniH LI I
recci(no change: cannot

Similarly, HS2 is prevented from applying across a geminate consonant.
Compare (3), where no gemination is found, with (4), where gemination
blocks HS2:

(7)HLι Α ™·dog punniH Lκν^.dog punnimouth pigs

FS2 may fail to apply, resulting in dog punni, or, optionally, may apply,
resulting in dog punni. Plural nouns, e.g. ayitti 'squirrels' (sg yi't ), do
not usually undergo the rule. With verbs, too, there are many more instances in my notes of the rule not being observed before a geminate consonant, e.g. ro c tto 'sell it quickly!'.
'Zero-consonants' (Sec. 1.6) behave like geminates in blocking the
spreading rules, though speakers are less consistent in the case of zeroconsonants than in the case of geminates. As an example of blocking,
awo'ro 'yesterday' begins with a zero-consonant — the Acholi counterpart
is l wo'ro. Given the configuration
(8)L HLH'HΛ II IIonena aworo3s-see-perf-lso yesterday

we would expect HS1 to apply, creating (after the application of FS1) the
ungrammatical *onena a'wo'ro. In fact, HS1 does not apply to form the
latter: the correct form is onena awo'ro, with HS1 failing to apply. Notice
that coalescence fails to apply as well. The word awo'ro consistently exhibits the zero-consonant phenomenon.","[74, 75, 76, 77]"
"9.2 Relative clauses
Relative constructions consist of a noun head (or antecedent) followed by
the relative clause. The order of the other elements in the NP is discussed
in Sec. 8.7.1. The relative clause itself consists of the attributive particle
1 97
ä and the particle me fused together to form the relative particle amc,
followed by a sentence, syntactically like sentences in main clauses except
that now a noun slot will be empty or filled with a pronoun interpreted as
coreferential with the head. So a sentence like
(1)loca märö gwökman 3s-like-hab dog
'the man likes the dog'
is occurring in a relative construction will take the form
(2) loce ame märö gwok
man rel + part 3s-like-hab dog
'the man that likes the dog'
where the subject slot within the relative clause is empty and interpreted
as coreferential to the head, locä. Or alternately, it will take the form
(3) gwokk äme locä märö
dog rel+part man 3s-like-hab
'the dog that the man likes'
where the direct object slot is empty and interpreted as coreferential to
the head noun gwök. In (2), we say that the subject has been relativized
on, and in (3), the direct object has been relativized on.
When the Su and DO are relativized on, the noun slot is left empty,
as in (2) and (3) above. It is also left empty if the IO is relativized where
the IO is not the object of bot 'to' (Section 1.5.1):
(4) loca ame rwot omiö lyec
man rel-part king 3s-give-perf elelphant
'the man that the king gave the elephant to'
However, if a benefactive, an associative, or an object of a preposition is
relativized on, a pronoun coreferential to the head is obligatorily placed216The syntax of complex sentencesin the noun slot. This pronoun is referred to as a 'resumptive' pronoun
and takes the form of an ordinary object pronoun:
Indirect object with bot
(5) loca am« rwot ömio lyec böteman rel+part king 3s-give-perf elephant to-3s
'the man that the king gave the elephant to'
benefactive
(6) atinn ami däkö owille bukchild rel+part woman 3s-buy-ben-perf-3s book
'the child that the woman bought a book'
associative
(7)loca amc atinnere omato cäkman rel+part child-3sa 3s-drink-perf milk
'the man whose child drank the milk'
object of preposition
(8) däkö arne rwot olego obaqa pirewoman rel+part king 3s-pray-perf God because+of
'the woman that the king prayed to God because of
Rclativization in Lango manifests the hierarchy of NP slots established by
Keenan and Comrie (1977): The subject, direct object, and advanced indirect object slots do not require a resumptive pronoun whereas all other
slots do. All noun slots in simple sentences can be relativized on, as well
as noun slots in hypotactic complement clauses:
(9) lyecc äme rwot ämitto willöelephant rel + part king 3s-want-prog buy-infin
'the elephant that the king wants to buy'
(10) lyecc äme rwot ämitto nx loca wilelephant rel + part king 3s-want-prog comp man
3s-buy-subj
'the elephant that the king wants the man to buy'
(11) loca ame rwöt ämittolyeccereman rel+part king 3s-want-prog see-infin elephant-3sa
'the man whose elephant the king wants to see'
Relativization in Lango obeys Ross' Complex NP Constraint, 1 9ft as
well as the Coordinate Structure Constraint for true coordinate structures
(i.e. those conjoined by ento 'but' or
Or'). The Sentential Subject Constraint is inapplicable since sentential subjects do not occur (Sec. 9.1.1).
NP's in serial constructions and in the first clause of a paratactic construction can be relativized on:Relative clauses217(1) loc» ame ogwag odio ojwato okelo
man rel+part O. 3spress-perf 3s-hit-perf O.
'the man that Ogwang forced to hit Okelo'
(2) Ioc9 ame tek katö okelo
man rel+part 3s-strong-hab 3s-exceed-hab O.
'the man that is stronger than Okelo'
However, there appears to be a constraint against relativizing NP's in the
second clause of a paratactic construction; no analogous constraint holds
for serial constructions:
paratactic
(3) *loca ami okelo odio ogwarj ojwätö/ojwäte
man rel+part O. 3s-press-perf O. 3s-hit-perf/
3s-hit-perf-3s
'the man that Okelo forced Ogwang to hit'
serial
(4) loco ame okelo tek katö
man rel+part O. 3s-strong-hab 3s-exceed-hab
'the man that Okelo is stronger than*
The infelicity of (3) hold with or without resumptive pronouns. Notice
that this constraint on relativization cannot be subsumed under the Coordinate Structure Constraint because relativization is not possible on NP's
in either conjunct of a true coordinate construction. Topicalization is possible even out the second clause of a paratactic construction (Sec. 9.9.1);
topicalization obeys the CNPC and the CSC in true coordinate constructions. However, cleft is like relativization in this regard (9.9.1). Recall
that nouns in hypotactic complements can be relativized on. Compare (3)
with (5):
(5) loca äme okelo odio ogwäq ni öjwät
man rel+part O. 3s-press-perf O. comp 3s-hit-subj
'the man that Okelo pressed Ogwang to hit'
In relative clauses, elements such as prepositions or head nouns with
relativized associatives may not be fronted, unlike their English counterparts. This, no doubt, simply reflects the fact that there is no relative
pronoun for them to be fronted with.
The relative particle ame may be replaced, especially in western
dialects, by aye. The relative particle is not obligatory; the attributive particle alone may suffice, or neither may be present:
(1) gwokk ame otoodog rel+part 3s-die-perf
'the dog that died'218The syntax of complex sentences(2) gwokkaotoo
dog att+part 3s-die-perf
'the dog that died'
(3) gwokk otoo
dog 3s-die-perf
'the dog that died'Notice that gemination of the final consonant of the head noun occurs
even when the attributive particle (or the relative particle, which contains
the attributive particle) is not present, signalling in this way an attributive, as opposed to a predicative, relation.
When the subject is relativized on, a perfective verb in the relative
clause takes on a special tonal contour (see Sec. 5.3.2). Compare (3)
with (4):
(4) gwök otoo
dog 3s-die-perf
'the dog died'
Relative clauses in Lango are always restrictive, which is to say they
always presuppose the existence of another entity that could be characterized by the head noun, but not by the relative construction as a whole.
So the relative construction in sentence (1)
(1) rwottame däktäl ödokking rel+part doctor 3s-go+back-perf
'the king who is a doctor went back'
presupposes the existence of a king who is not a doctor. The English nonrestrictive counterpart:
(2) the king, who is a doctor, went back
which does not presuppose the existence of another king, does not have
a Lango counterpart. The usual translation of (2) would be:
(3) rwot däktäl. odok
king 3s-doctor-hab. 3s-go+back-perf
'the king is a doctor, he went back'
Notice, however, that (2) and (3) are not equivalent. (2) presupposes that
the king is a doctor, while (3) asserts it.
Attributive adjectives constructions, such as (1),
(1) rwott ä räcking att+part bad
'the bad king'
could be analyzed as a relative clause construction. As mentioned above,
the relative particle ami can be replaced by the attributive particle ä in
relative constructions and rac could be analyzed as a predicate adjective.","[231, 232, 233, 234]"
"Other morphophonemic processes191.4.4 The 0/y/c alternationA number of roots in Lango evidence a 0/y/c alternation:
(a) opa-o
'he carved it'(b) pa»y-o

'he swept it'we*y-o
'to sweep it'owe-o

'my head' 16(c) apac
'carver'

owec
'broom'wie
'head'For these roots, C2 is realized as 0 in the (a) set, as /y/ in the (b) set, and
as /c/ in the (c) set. The generalizations governing this alternation are
these:
(1) C2 is realized as /y/ in verbs otherwise requiring a
geminate Cg, such as in the infinitive stem, in forms built off
the infinitive stem like the progressive aspect, before the
middle voice suffix -e, etc.
(2) C2 is realized as /c/ word finally, except in subjunctives
(imperatives are a variety of subjunctive — Sec. 5.3.2 and
Sec. 8.2.7). Compare
v
pa.'carve it!'
with äpäc 'carver' from the same root. An exception involves
nouns which are heads of inalienable associative constructions (Sec. 8.7.2). In such cases, C2 is realized as 0:
wi ögwäijhead merekat
'a merekat's head'cf wicc a däköhead att+part woman
'the woman's (animal) head'wi ogwar) involves inalienable possession; therefore, the
head noun wlc appears as wi.

suffixes signalling alienable possession (Sec. 8.7.2):cfwi-»wicc-a'my (own) head''my (animal) head'bam-abämm-ä'my (own) pelvis'my (animal) pelvis'20Consonants(4) C2 is realized as 0 elsewhere
