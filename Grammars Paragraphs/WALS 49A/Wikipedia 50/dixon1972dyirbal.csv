"5-2Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language135We began by noticing that, very much as in the case of Hidatsa,
Dyirbal appeared on the surface to be a language of mixed syntactic
type, and to constitute an exception to the hypothesis that all languages
are either strictly nominative-accusative or strictly nominative-ergative.
Matthews showed that in Hidatsa the underlying syntactic pattern was
nominative-accusative, the apparent ergativity being explainable in
terms of a general causative relation. We have shown the opposite for
Dyirbal - that the underlying syntax is nominative-ergative, with the
apparent accusative nature being the result of special rules for assigning
pronominal inflections (5.8.2). Thus, in each case, detailed investigation
of apparent exceptions shows that these languages do, in fact, conform
to the universal hypothesis.
It was mentioned, in 1.4, that the majority of Australian languages
have nouns inflecting in a nominative-ergative pattern, and pronouns
following a nominative-accusative paradigm, as in Dyirbal. It is likely
that it will be possible to show, by methods similar to those used for
Dyirbal, that in each case the underlying syntax is of the nominativeergative type. It is interesting to note that some languages (for example,
Walbiri) have both pronouns and nouns inflecting in a nominativeergative pattern.
It is something of an oversimplification to say that pronouns often follow
a nominative-accusative pattern. In G, for instance, singular pronouns have
different forms for each of the three basic syntactic functions, S, A and O;
a similar situation prevails in most languages of the eastern seaboard, and for
some elsewhere. And in Pittapitta [Roth, 1897], for instance, pronouns show
different forms for S, A and O in all persons and numbers. It would be more
accurate to say that pronouns often appear on the surface NOT to follow a
nominative-ergative pattern, but DO follow such a pattern in their syntactic
behaviour.
There are, according to Hale [1970] two groups of languages in which both
pronouns and nouns inflect in a nominative-accusative way: one in the northwest, and one centred on the Wellesley Islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Hale mentions [1970: 759] that 'it is possible to show that the northwestern
languages are only superficially accusative, that they have developed an accusative system of case marking. . .in quite recent times'.
The best-known representative of the Wellesley Islands group of languages
is Lardil. Lardil shows many divergences from the common Australian pattern,
sketched in chapter 1, and it is clear that if it is related toother Australian languages
(as does in fact seem likely) then it has undergone some rather sweeping syntactic
and other changes. It is quite natural to suppose that these have included changes
that altered the inflectional system from a nominative-ergative to a nominativeaccusative type. It is interesting to note that the object of an imperative
sentence is, if a noun, in nominative case (which is the case used to mark1365- 2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative languagetransitive and intransitive subject, in non-imperative sentences) and not
accusative (which is the case a transitive object must be in, in a non-imperative
sentence). Imperative constructions typically preserve archaic patterns (Whitney, 1889: 215; Watkins, 1963, 1970; Kurytowicz, 1964: 137), and the fact that
Lardil imperatives have nominative-ergative overtones suggests that Lardil
may have evolved from a language that was of the nominative-ergative type.
However, a great deal of descriptive and historical work would have to be
done in order to confirm or disprove this hypothesis.
There is thus a good deal of evidence SUGGESTING that pro to-Australian
(the postulated ancestor language from which all modern languages are
descended) had a nominative-ergative type syntax.
Hale [1970] has, somewhat surprisingly, postulated that pro to-Australian
was of the nominative-accusative type. He is thus suggesting that Lardil and
the two or three other languages in the Wellesley Islands group, that have
undergone a number of drastic changes of various sorts, retain the original
syntactic pattern; and that the two hundred or so other Australian languages,
that have probably undergone considerably milder changes of other sorts,
have completely changed their syntactic type. As we have already mentioned,
Hale believes that the north-western group of nominative-accusative languages
have developed an accusative system rather recently; he must thus be suggesting
that this group evolved from an ancestor that was of nominative-accusative
type, through some intermediate stages in which the syntactic pattern was
nominative-ergative.
A full discussion of Hale's proposals, which were meant to be quite tentative
and suggestive, would be out of place here. We will, however, mention two
fundamental points on which his discussion is misleading:
[1] Hale states that nominative-accusative languages ALWAYS have a voice
distinction (i.e. a passive transformation), whereas nominative-ergative languages
NEVER do. In fact, having discounted the north-western languages, he is dealing
with a single group of * true accusative languages' - Lardil and its neighbours
- which do have a distinction of voice. He fails to mention that Dyirbal has,
through the -tjay transformation, a voice distinction; the same is true of
Wargamay, to the south of Dyirbal (and see 4.4.2).
[2] Largely to explain this correlation between case and voice, Hale suggests
that ergative languages have an underlying accusative structure, but that
their transitive sentences are obligatorily in passive form. As evidence to
support this suggestion Hale implies that the ergative inflection in ergative
languages is frequently cognate with the inflection on the passive agent in
accusative languages. In fact, Hale illustrates his discussion with ' artificial
examples, using reconstructible morphemes' - that is, the examples are not
sentences in any known Australian language. Uncontroversially, he uses -pgu
for the ergative inflection (cf. 1.6). He also uses -tjgu for passive agent in
sentences said to be typical of accusative languages, and mentions that 'the
striking similarity between passive and ergative surface structures is, of course,
exaggerated in the artificial examples because I have used phonologically
identical suffixes to represent the ergative ending in B and the agentive ending
in A. However, this is not totally devoid of historical reality - in some Australian
accusative languages, e.g. Kurama-Yintjipanti of the Northwest, the agentive5.2Byirbal as a nominative-ergative language137ending in passives is clearly descended from *-ygu~-lu, which is the predominant source for the ergative inflection' [1970: 761]. But this is irrelevant,
since Hale has already stated that Kurama-Yintjipanti have changed from
ergative to accusative type in quite recent times. It is surely only relevant
to consider passive agentive inflection in languages of the Wellesley Islands
group. In Lardil this inflection is, in non-future sentences, identical to the
genitive inflection, i.e. -rjan~-kan\ and in future sentences, it is identical to
the non-future accusative i.e. -n~-in (Hale 1970: 777 and private communication). It is thus not remotely similar to the common ergative inflections
-ygu and -lu.","[158, 159, 160, 161]"
"212Dyirbal: the language and its
speakers2.1 Linguistic type
Dyirbal is a typical Australian language. It is entirely suffixing, largely
agglutinative, and has extraordinarily free word order.
Phonologically it is rather simple, having the smallest number of
phonemes of any Australian language. In addition to four stop-nasal
series - bilabial, apico-alveolar, dorso-velar and laminal - there is a
single lateral, a semi-retroflex continuant, a trill and two semi-vowels.
Dyirbal has the usual three-vowel system, length not being significant.
Roots and inflected words begin with a consonant and have at least
two syllables; intervocalically there are two and three-member consonant
clusters. The first syllables of roots, and of most affixes, bear stress.
There are clearly defined classes of (first and second person) pronoun,
noun, adjective, verb, adverbal, time qualifier, particle and interjection.
There are four noun classes (genders), marked not in the form of a noun
but by a 'noun marker' that normally accompanies a noun; noun
markers also have some of the functions fulfilled by third person
pronouns in other languages. A noun marker indicates the class of
a noun, agrees with it in case, and also indicates whether the referent
of the noun is visible or invisible; here or there; up hill, down hill, up
river, down river or across river; and whether a long, short or medium
distance up or down.
Pronouns distinguish singular, dual and plural in both first and second
person; there is no inclusive/exclusive distinction, and no incorporation
of pronominal affixes into the verb. While nouns and noun markers
inflect in a nominative-ergative pattern, pronouns (at least superficially)
follow a nominative-accusative paradigm.
There is a four-term case system for pronouns and a nine-term one
for nouns, noun markers and adjectives. A pronoun, noun, noun marker
or adjective in genitive case can take a further inflection, provided
a catalytic affix '-^zV is inserted immediately after the genitive. There
are about twenty stem-forming affixes that can precede case inflections
with nouns and adjectives.
[22]2.1 Linguistic type23Verbs and adverbals take a variety of aspectual and derivational
affixes; the tense system has two members - future and non-future.
There is a clear division into transitive and intransitive verbs (and
similarly for adverbals). Two conjugation subclasses correlate statistically with, but do not coincide with, transitive and intransitive subclasses; there is one irregular verb, yanu, 'go'. There is no copula, nor
any verb 'have' or 'become'. The language has wide and much-used
possibilities of verbalisation (that apply to all nouns and adjectives, and
to certain nominal expressions) and nominalisation (that apply to all
verbs and adverbals).
Sentence modification is achieved partly through a set of about
a dozen non-inflecting particles, and partly through three clitics, that
are added to the end of the first word of a sentence. There is no separate
class of locational words, as there is of time qualifiers. Locational
information is largely dealt with through the complex 'noun marker'
system; there are also some locational adjectives.
Dyirbal texts contain strong topic patterning: a topic may be stated,
and then commented upon by a string of a score or so sentences,
without repetition of the topic form. Topic patterning exploits the
common Australian 'implicative relation' realised by -gu; this can
occur with nouns, as a dative case inflection, indicating 'indirect object',
and with verbs, instead of a tense inflection, indicating 'result' or
'purpose'.","[45, 46, 47]"
"5.2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language
5.2.1 A universal hypothesis. All languages appear to have transitive
and intransitive sentences, and thus to involve the three syntactic
functions * transitive subject [A]', ' transitive object [O]' and 'intransitive subject [S]\ It appears that there are two basic syntactic types:
[1] nominative-accusative languages, in which S is syntactically
identified with A; and
[2] nominative-ergative languages, in which S is syntactically
identified with O.
For instance, most of the languages of Europe and of Africa have
a nominative-accusative syntax. Nominative-ergative languages are less
numerous, but there are a number of well-attested examples - Eskimo,
Basque, Chinook and so on. (See also Allen [1951], W. K. Matthews
[1953] and Milner [1962].)
It has been suggested that some languages are of a mixed type showing, for instance, some nominative-ergative characteristics within
a basically nominative-accusative syntax. In each such case, when the
language has been investigated in more detail and depth, it has become
apparent that it is not in fact of a mixed type. Thus G. H. Matthews
[i960, 1965: i42ff] mentions that' the Siouan languages have often been5-2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language
cited as languages which exhibit the ergative relation'; he demonstrates
that 'the ergative, in itself, is not a fundamental relation in Hidatsa
[a Siouan language], but rather an automatic result of a fundamental
distinction between two types of verb phrase, and a general causative
construction'.
Halliday [1967-8] has recently suggested that English involves a mixture of
nominative-accusative and nominative-ergative patterning. It is easy to show
that English is, in fact, pure nominative-accusative in syntax - in the same
way that Matthews showed this for Hidatsa - and that what appears to
Halliday to be evidence for a nominative-ergative character is the result of
transformational changes on a nominative-accusative base. Some of Halliday's
examples are causative versions of underlying intransitive constructions - ' he
marched the prisoners', which is related to 'the prisoners marched'. The
causative transformation is attested for a large number of languages and
appears to have some kind of universal status; it is thus quite natural to posit
a causative transformation in English. Languages that are morphologically
rich often have a special affix that marks a verb as causative - this is the case
in Swahili and Turkish, for example; it is quite natural that English, with its
rather limited morphological resources, should mark causatives entirely through
word order. Halliday's other examples involve the phenomenon of bringing
a non-subject NP to the front of a sentence - as in ' the clothes washed [well]',
derived from ' [someone] washed the clothes'. This can only be done in the
presence of a manner adverbal, modal, or other qualifier; the process applies
not only to object NPs but also, in appropriate circumstances, to instrumental
NPs, locative NPs, and perhaps others [Dixon, 1970 c]. Halliday pays no
attention to the formulation of strong hypotheses concerning linguistic universals,
and is thus happy to accept that English is syntactically 'mixed'. It is, in fact,
his failure to set up any 'deep structure' that will deal with the underlying
semantic relations, and his insistence on setting up systems which will directly
generate 'surface structures', that lead him to suggest that English is part
accusative, part ergative in character.
The facts concerning known languages suggest the postulation of
a ' universal hypothesis *:
Each natural language is either strictly nominative-accusative, or
strictly nominative-ergative in syntax,
or, putting the same claim in different words:
In any language, the syntactic function in an intransitive construction
(S) is syntactically identified with one and only one of the functions
in a transitive construction (that is, either with A or with O).
It appears on the surface that there are two constructional patterns
in Dyirbal - the nominal nominative-ergative type, and the pronominal
nominative-accusative type (4.1). Dyirbal thus initially appears to be
a language of mixed type, and to constitute an exception to the universal1291305- 2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative languagehypothesis. In fact we shall show that there is only one UNDERLYING
constructional pattern - the nominative-ergative type - that applies to
all sentences, whether involving nouns or pronouns or both. A detailed
investigation of its syntactic functioning thus reveals Dyirbal to be
a 'pure' nominative-ergative language.
5.2.2 Syntactic identification in Dyirbal. Let us first recapitulate
the formation of topic-chains from simple sentences involving nouns:
[1] A simple topic-chain involves the identification of the topic NP
in one simple sentence with the topic NP in the next; that is, we may
have S NP identified with O NP, O with S, S with S, or O with O.
Thus from:
(416) bayiyaia banijiu man came here
(417) bayiyaia baygun d,ugumbiiu balgan woman hit man
where the bayi yara in (416) and (417) have the same referent, can be
derived:
(418) bayi yara banipu baygun d/ugumbiru balgan man came here and
was hit by woman
And from (417), (416) can be derived:
(419) bayi ya^a baygun djugumbiiu balgan banipu man was hit by
woman and came here
Similarly in the case of two intransitive sentences with the same S NP,
or two transitive sentences with the same O NP.
[2] If we have two simple sentences such that the topic (S or O)
NP of the first is identical with the A NP of the second, then the -yay
transformation must be applied to the second sentence before it can
be joined to the first in a topic-chain. Thus, from (416) and:
(420) balan djUgumbil baygul yaraygu balgan man hit woman
can be derived the favourite construction:
(421) bayi yara banipu bagun d,ugumbilgu balgalyapu man came here
and hit woman
Similarly when the first sentence is transitive, with bayi yara the
ONP.
[3] If we have two simple sentences such that the A NP - in ergative5.2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language131inflection - of the first is identical with the topic NP of the second,
then they can be joined in a -yura construction. Thus from (420) and
(416) can be derived:
(422) balan djUgumbil baygul yayaygu balgan {bayi yaya) baniyura
hit woman and then immediately came heremanWe can now turn to sentences involving pronouns. [1] Consider:
(423) yaq]a banijm I came here
(424) yayguna baygun d,ugumbiiu balganwoman hit mewhich exactly correspond to (416-17), with ' I ' replacing 'man'. Note
that although bayi ya^a is in nominative case in both (416) and (417),
the pronoun takes the form yad,a in (423) and yayguna in (424). Now
a topic-chain can be formed from (423-4) exactly as it can from (416-17):
(425) yadja banijm baygun djUgumbiiu balgan
by womanI came here and was hitSimilarly, from (424), (423):
(426) yayguna baygun q]ugumbiiu balgan banijtu
and came hereI was hit by womanIt will be seen that the pronominal S NP in (423) is syntactically
identified with the pronominal O NP in (424), even though the pronoun
has a different form in the two NPs. The form of the pronominal topic
in such a topic-chain is the form it takes in the first underlying simple
sentence - thus in (425), with underlying sequence (423), (424), the
form is yad,a from (423); in (426), with underlying sequence (424),
(423), it is yayguna from (424).
[2] Consider now two simple sentences, involving pronouns, such
that the S NP of the first is identical with the A NP of the second. For
instance, (423) and:
(427) yad,a balan d,ugumbil balganI hit womanwhich exactly correspond to (416) and (420), again with ' I ' replacing
'man'. Note that the pronoun is in the same form in (423) and (427),
contrasting with the situation in the nominal sentences - ' man J is in
nominative inflection in (416) but in ergative in (420).
However, despite the identity of form of the pronouns in (423) and
(427), a topic-chain can NOT be formed from these two sentences by
5-21325- 2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative languagesimple coordination. That is, (428) is NOT a permissible Dyirbal
sentence:
^(428) yaa]a banijiu balan djUgumbil balgan
Instead, (423) and (427) must be joined by a favourite construction,
exactly as in the case of (416) and (420):
(429) yaq\a banijiu bagun djUgumbilgu balgalyajiu
womanI came here and hitA favourite construction must also be used to join two sentences,
when the ' identical NP' is in O function in the first and in A function
in the second, whether this identical NP is nominal or pronominal.
Thus, from:
(430) yayguna baygul gubiygu mundan the gubi took me
and (427), is derived:
(431) yayguna baygul gubiygu mundan bagun d,ugumbilgu balgalyajiu
the gubi took me and I hit woman
[3] Similarly, a topic-chain cannot be formed from (427) and (423)
by simple coordination. (432) is, like (428), quite ungrammatical:
^(432) yaa]a balan djUgumbil balgan banijiu
That is, (428) and (432) are ungrammatical in the sense in which r}ad,a is
taken to be in syntactic function to the second verb. An informant mentioned
that (428) could mean * I came here and someone hit the woman - not me';
(432) can, of course, mean * I hit the woman and she came here'.
Instead, (427) and (423) must be joined by a -yura construction,
exactly as in the case of (420) and (416):
(433) Va4a balan djUgumbil balgan (yacfa) baniyura
then immediately came hereI hit woman andThus in FORM pronouns show a nominative-accusative patterning
but in FUNCTION they exhibit a nominative-ergative patterning, exactly
as do nominals. S and O pronouns have different forms but are
syntactically identified, exactly as are S and O nouns (that have the
same form). S and A pronouns have identical forms in D and M but
can NOT simply be identified, exactly as S and A nouns (with different
forms) can NOT simply be identified.
This is further borne out by the verbal inflections in relative clauses.","[152, 153, 154, 155, 156]"
"The ablative case, and the stem-forming nominal affix ' out of - ,
from - ' have the same realisation: -yunu. These are semantically similar
but differ functionally: the nominal affix can be followed by a case
inflection, whereas the ablative case inflection must be word-final; a
nominal plus stem-forming affix -yunu behaves like an adjective,
modifying the head noun in an NP, whereas a nominal in ablative case
provides locational qualification for the head noun in a VP, agreeing
with the verb marker in locational choice (i.e. co-occurring only with
verb markers bayum, yayum). Informants gave sentences (547-8) and:6.1Morphology of nouns and adjectives237(597) bayi

(598) yad,a pinaji yaiayga yiyariyunuga I'll sit by the man from the
hole [e.g. a man that had fallen into a hole and had to be pulled
out again]
It appears impossible to have a word involving two -rjunu's - a stem-forming
affix followed by ablative inflection. Thus informants rejected:
*(599) Va4a banijiu bayum ya^ayunu yitjarirjunutjunu
in favour of:
(600) r)ad,a banijiu barjum yatayunu yiyaribaravunu
from holeI'm coming from manAlthough the simple genitive cases in Dyirbal have some semantic
similarities with genitive and dative cases set up for other languages
(for example, Latin) there are significant differences. For example,
wugal 'give' typically occurs in a proleptic construction; that is, the
giver will be in the ergative case, that which is given in the nominative
case, and the recipient in the simple genitive case, as a possessive
phrase qualifying that which is given:
(601) balam miraji bayun a]ugumbilyu baygul yapaygu wugan man gave
woman beans
literally * man gave beans, which belong to woman [understood: beans
are given to person to whom they belong]'. This kind of construction
is consistent with the Dyirbalnan's belief that something must belong
'by right'; there is very little spontaneous non-necessary giving, but
a great deal of necessary giving, according to the people's habits of
sharing most things with their relatives etc. - 2.4. A full account of the
considerable syntactic possibilities of wugan is in 8.2.3.
The locative case has, in addition to its central use as an indicator
of position, the following uses:
[1] when something is done because of X, X can receive locative
inflection. There is very frequently an element of fear involved here:
what is done may be done to avoid contact with X. For example
(text xv, lines 24 and 36, pp. 373-4):2386.1Morphology of nouns and adjectives(602) giyipaygadayi yali buybarigu let us hide ourselves away from him
(603) yuiay yali jiina\bayuldjinda we must sit quietly, because of that
which belongs to him (i.e. so that we do not become involved
with it)
A locative inflection of this type can go on to:
either [a] a noun marker plus -jia, e.g. bayipayga 'for fear of him
there', yayijiayga 'for fear of him here'
or [b] a noun marker in genitive inflection, e.g. bayuldjinda,
yayuld/inda
or [c] a noun in genitive inflection, e.g. djUmbuluyujtdjinda
However, it cannot go on to a simple noun root, or a noun root plus
-pa; thus (qua this sense) *djUmbuluga> *q]umbulujiayga.
Forms of type [c] can co-occur with type [a] or with type [b]:
(604) galga yanum bayipayga djUmbuluyupdjinda don't go for fear of
Dyumbulu
(605) galga yanum bayuldjinda djumbuluyupa]inda ( = (604))
A locative in sense [1] can involve a relative clause:
(606) yalidji buybayiri bayijiayga baniyura hide for fear of him that
has [/may] come
Note that the verb inflection -bila (4.13.1) can occur with dative but
not with locative inflection.
Further examples are in text xxxib, lines 1 and 2 (p. 383).
[2] locative inflection is used in some cases when (on the basis of
English 'to') dative might be expected; that is, locative marks certain
'objects' of adjectives etc. Thus a]ilbay means 'know how to do something, e.g. used to the job'; it can also mean 'know a certain person,
i.e. familiar with their ways and habits', as in:
(607) bayi djilbaybin yaygua]inda he's used to me (say, he knows he
can treat my place like home, and help himself to my food, etc.)
[3] locative can also mean ' amongst -, of - ' :
(608) bayi midid,aran bulayi ya%ayga bulgangayd,a they are the smallest
two of the men [literally, they are two small amongst big(ger)
men]
[4] when talking about language activity, the name of a language or6.iMorphology of nouns and adjectives239style of speech (e.g.guwal, a]alyuy) may be in locative case, e.g. giramay q]a
'in Giramay', djirbaja 'in Dyirbal':
(609) yinda wurba giramayq]a you talk in Giramay!
or wiyaman d,alyuyq\a 'how is it done (i.e. said) in Dyalquy?'.
Note that an alternative to (609) is:
(610) yinda giramay wurbayou talk Giramay!where the noun referring to 'language' is in the topic NP (here yinda
giramay should perhaps be regarded as an instance of inalienable
possession).
[5] locative is the only case inflection that can occur with D M
yimba, G may a 'nothing'; thus yimbayga 'concerning nothing*-see
(351) and 4.17.
6.1.6 -<£ana> 'ban. Affixes -q]ana and -ban can be placed at the end
of various types of words; they do not appear to have any clear cognitive
meaning, nor any very fixed or strong syntactic function.
-a]ana can be affixed to noun markers, demonstrative markers, pronouns and time qualifiers. It draws attention to a certain person or
thing: 'this is the one'.
(611) yindadjana yayguna yuna\ajiu you're the one that blamed me
(612) yaygunadjana yinda yuna]ajiu I'm the one you blamed
One use of -d,ana is in replying to a question about some earlier sentence
that was not clearly understood. Thus, if a speaker said:
(613) gilu yaa]a yanujiI'll go later on todaybut the addressee, not hearing clearly, asked:
(614) mijiaywhen?the speaker would be likely to say:
(615) giludjana yad,a yanujt
emphasising the gilu by means of -d,ana.
-djOna cannot normally be affixed to more than one word in an NP
(or, for that matter, in a sentence). Thus we can say bayind,ana ya^a
duygarajiu 'man cried' or bayiyapacfana duygarajiu but not ^bayincfana
duygarajiu.","[260, 261, 262, 263]"
"In a number of languages both -{fj)gu and -lu ~ -lu occur, as allomorphic101.6 Noun and adjectivevariants of the ergative case. Thus in Walbiri -ygu is used with disyllabic
stems and -lu with those of three or more syllables. In Pitjantjatjara
-lu occurs with proper nouns ending in a vowel and -ygu with common
nouns and adjectives ending in a vowel; proper nouns, common nouns
and adjectives that end in a consonant take a homorganic stop plus
-u in the ergative inflection [Trudinger, 1943: 206/7].
Ergative case inflections are one of the most complex and most fascinating
areas of Australian comparative grammar. A full discussion would be out of
place here but one or two further examples may be given. Thargari has some
similarities to Walbiri: ergative inflection is -gu (a development from -ygu)
with a disyllabic stem ending in a vowel, but -du (with assimilation, etc.) on
all other stems [Klokeid, 1969: 25]. It is tempting to speculate whether the
-du might be related to an original -lu. Gumbaingar makes an interesting
comparison - oversimplifying slightly, ergative is -du after a vowel, a homorganic stop plus -u after a nasal, and just -u after I [Smythe, 1948/9: 29-31].
If Gumbairjgar -du inflection were related to an original -lu it would seem that
-lu can be assimilated to a stem-final consonant in the same way as can -(rj)gu.
The situation is even more complex in Walmatjari; here the ergative inflection
is:
-lu after a stem of three or more syllables ending in a vowel;
-rju on a disyllabic stem ending in a vowel;
-u on a stem ending in a lateral or r;
-du after a stem ending in a bilabial or apico-alveolar nasal or stop;
-du after a stem ending in an apico-domal nasal or stop; and
-3/u after a stem ending in a dorso-velar or lamino-palatal/alveolar nasal or
stop.
The final three alternants specify a stop after a stem ending in a nasal or a stop;
note the rather limited assimilation here. Alternant -lu is presumably related
to the -lu ~ -lu occurring in other languages; -rju may be related to the ergative
inflection -(y)gu in other languages; it then remains to decide whether the
alternants involving a stop relate to -lu, or to -rju, or whether they are historically
independent of both.
Virtually every language has a locative - 'at', 'on', 'in' — inflection
of nouns and adjectives. In the great majority of cases this is exactly
the same as the ergative inflection except that the final vowel of the
locative is -a> as against -u for the ergative case. The often complex
alternations encountered in the case of the ergative are exactly repeated
for the locative.
Thus Waluwara has -ga for locative inflection. Gumbaingar has -da after a
vowel, a homorganic stop plus -a after a nasal, and just -a after / [Smythe,
1948/9: 29-31]. And similarly, repeating the alternations sketched above, for
Thargari [Klokeid, 1969: 28], Walbiri and Walmatjari. Different dialects of
the Pi tjantjatjar a/Western Desert language vary slightly in their ergative and
locative inflections - sometimes the two cases are out of step. Thus, for the1.6 Noun and adjective11dialect Trudinger [1943: 206/7] describes, proper nouns ending in a vowel
have ergative -lu and locative -la, and common nouns ending in a vowel have
ergative -rjgu and locative -yga. However, in the dialects described by Douglas
[1964] and Glass and Hackett [1970: 34], proper nouns ending in a vowel
take -lu and -la but common nouns ending in a vowel have ergative -lu and
locative -yga.
In Wembawemba there has evidently been a semantic shift: inflections -ga
after stem-final vowels and -a after consonants signal what Hercus [1969: 46-8]
refers to as the ' general oblique * case with a basic meaning * movement towards';
this contrasts with two locative cases -{g)al 'on' and -(g)ada 'in'.
In some languages phonological change has clearly neutralised an original
contrast between ergative and locative. Thus in Aranda - a language which
has changed in such a way that now every word ends in the same central
vowel, written a - both ergative and locative inflections are -la [Strehlow,
1944: 202]. In Wik-Munkan, ergative and locative fall together and here the
form -f) probably goes back to -{rj)gu and -{y)ga respectively.
Languages in which the locative inflection appears not to be morphologically
similar to the ergative include Kalkatungu [Blake, 1969: 33] and Arabana.
Some languages in the eastern part of the continent have been said
to have a special'instrumental' case. However, a separate instrumental
case is lacking in most languages. Commonly, instrumental coincides
with ergative - that is, both an actor, and the implement he uses, receive
the same inflection. For some languages instrumental coincides not
with ergative but with locative.
Instrumental coincides with locative in Waluwara (both are shown as -ga).
Lardil nouns inflect according to a nominative-accusative pattern so that there
is no ergative inflection; the instrumental is based on the future locative. In
Aranda, ergative, locative and instrumental all fall together as -la. Some early
and not altogether reliable grammars distinguished a quite separate instrumental
-for example, in Yaraikana [Ray, 19076: 272] and in Wiradhari [Gunther,
1892: 57].
One of the features which characterises languages of the continent
is the affix -gu, that commonly appears with both nouns and verbs.
Nominal -gu, which can be called the 'dative' case inflection, occurs
in a wide variety of languages and marks the indirect object, or some
additional object that is 'implicated' in the event described by the
sentence.
See Capell [1956: 77-8]. A full syntactic and semantic discussion of -gu will
be found in §5.3.3-4 below.
Some languages have - in addition to locative - separate allative and
ablative inflections; other languages lack these and show the difference
between 'rest' and 'motion towards'/'motion away from' by other121.6 Noun and adjectivemeans. It is not uncommon for dative and allative to fall together.
Where there are separate allative and ablative inflections there is wide
variation of forms between different languages (however, ablative does
have the form -yu{[u) in a fair number of languages).
The only other case affix with wide occurrence is genitive. There is
more variation of forms from language to language than in the case of
the dative, but cases -gu and -yu do recur fairly frequently. (Occasionally,
genitive and dative fall together, e.g. Gugu-Yimidir [Roth, 1901a: 16,
28].) In all or almost all languages possessive nouns and pronouns can
be declined like adjectives: thus in the marts son hit you, man might
take genitive inflection PLUS ergative inflection. In most cases a further
inflection can go straight on to the genitive form; sometimes a special
affix must be added after genitive and before the further case inflection.
There are just a few languages with different sets of case inflections,
depending on whether the noun is singular, dual or plural; that is, a
single affix carries an indication both of case and of number (for
instance, Narrinyeri - Taplin, 1880; also Teichelmann and Schurmann,
1840: 5). There are some languages whose noun and pronoun inflections
show tense as well as case - these are located in the Gulf country, or
else due south of the Gulf, as far down as New South Wales.
In Lardil, for instance, each case has both a future and a non-future form
(although there is some neutralisation: for instance, there are non-future
accusative and non-future locative inflections, but a single inflection for future
accusative-locative). The classic example of nouns inflecting for tense is
Pittapitta [Roth, 1897]. See also Capell [1956: 59] on Gunu.","[33, 34, 35, 36]"
"In 5.2.2 we give syntactic reasons suggesting that pronouns, like
nouns, follow an underlying nominative-ergative pattern. Throughout
the grammar 'nominative' is used to mean a case in a nominativeergative system (that is, referring to transitive object and intransitive
subject); we do not recognise an 'accusative' case for Dyirbal.
Sentences can mix nouns and pronouns quite freely, without any
possibility of ambiguity. Thus:
(32) yaa]a bayi ya^a balgan I am hitting man
(33) yayguna baygul yayaygu balgan Man is hitting me
4.2 Noun phrases
4.2.1 Non-pronominal noun phrases. If it does not contain a
pronoun, a N[oun] P[hrase] will as a rule contain a noun and noun
marker, and can also contain any number of adjectives (although in
texts few NPs involve more than one adjective). The marker most often
precedes and adjectives follow the noun. However, it is perfectly normal
for NPs in Dyirbal to contain only a marker, or only a noun, or only
an adjective, or else just noun and adjective, or marker and adjective.
If there is no noun the unmarked reference of a class I marker will be
to a man or men, and of a class II marker to a woman or women (but
a class II marker without a noun might, in a suitably marked situational
context, refer to a turtle say, or the sun; and so on):
(34) bayi banipu [man] is coming4'2 Noun phrases61(35) bulgan bani/iu big [something] is coming
(36) bayi bulgan banijiu big [man] is coming
(37) bayi ya^a bulgan banijiu big man is coming
Sentences such as (34-6) occur freely in Dyirbal speech. However, informants
- while agreeing that such sentences were used - insisted that (37) was more
correct than (35) and (36). This suggests that a noun and noun marker should
be taken to underlie every non-pronominal NP, forms (34-36) being accounted
for in terms of * discourse ellipsis \
Superficially at least, noun and adjective appear to have:
[1] the same syntactic possibilities - each can be the only word in an
NP; each can be verbalised in the same ways (4.7.1); and so on.
[2] the same inflectional morphology.
They can best be distinguished in terms of surface grammar on the
grounds that an adjective can usually occur in an NP with a noun
marker belonging to any of the four classes, whereas a noun is limited
to occurrence with markers of just one class (or at most two-3.2.2).
Noun and adjective can also be distinguished semantically.
Dyirbal distinguishes between what we can call * alienable' and
'inalienable' possession. Alienable possession (including kinship
relation) is shown through genitive inflection of the words of the
possessor NP-4.11. Inalienable possession is shown simply by apposition.
In addition to a head noun, usually accompanied by a marker showing
its class, an NP can contain a second 'modifier' noun that cannot be
accompanied by a marker. In this case the referent of the modifying
noun is inalienably possessed by the referent of the head (as being
'a part of it). Both nouns take case inflection appropriate to the
syntactic function of the NP :
(38) bala mambu baygul yayaygu balgan man is hitting a back
(39) balan djugumbil mambu barjgul yapaygu balgan man is hitting
woman's back
Dyirbal discourse is extraordinarily elliptical, and it would be perfectly normal
to omit Qugunibil from (39), producing:
(40) balan mambu Bangui yaxangu balgan man is hitting her back
In (40) balan is the sole realisation of the NP head, mambu being a non-head
modifying noun. (40) can be distinguished from (38) - which involves no statement of inalienable possession, and in which mambu is the head of its NP through the different noun markers; (38) involves a class IV marker, corresponding to mambu, whereas (40) involves a class II marker, corresponding to the
omitted possessor noun.","[84, 85]"
"[6] The two types of -yay construction - the O NP being in ergative
inflection in one, but in dative in the other (4.4.2).
[125J5- J126Points to be explained[7] The fact that there is only one type of -yay construction if the
head of the O NP is a pronoun; it must then be in dative inflection.
(There is thus no pronominal correspondent of a -yay construction in
which the O noun is in ergative inflection - for instance *yad[a yinda
balgalyajiu is impossible.) (4.4.2).
[8] The unacceptability of -yay constructions of the type ^(92),
which involve an O NP in ergative inflection and a verb in purposive
inflection; this is somewhat surprising in the light of the acceptability
of (65), (67), (69), (90) and (91) (4.4.3).

[12] The fact that transitive roots in -yay, reflexive or reciprocal
form function intransitively (for instance: they can occur in VCs with
intransitive, but not with transitive, roots) (4.9.3, 4.8).
[13] Similarly, the fact that an intransitive root in comitative form
functions transitively (4.9.3).
[14] The acceptability of minimal sentences, which contain no verb

[18] The formal identity of dative and allative inflections on nouns
and adjectives, as opposed to the non-identity of these inflections in
the case of noun markers and verb markers (3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.4.5).
[19] The similarity between ergative and locative inflections morphophonological alternations are the same in each case, the sole
difference being that ergative always ends in -u and locative in -a
(3.2.1, 4.10).
[20] The fact that the -yura inflection on verbs (4.5.5) is identical
to the inflection of the verb in a relative clause to a locative noun:
-yu + -ra (4.10).
[21] The formal identity of ergative and instrumental nominal
inflections (3.2.1, 3.2.2).
[22] The occurrence of instrumental NPs in both transitive and
intransitive sentences (4.9.1).
[23] The fact that the -yay transformation changes the case of an
NP in ergative case, but leaves untouched an instrumental NP (4.9.1).
[24] The two different types of instrumental construction - one
involving an instrumental NP and the other an instrumentve VC.
Thus (242) and (253), for instance, are synonymous. The way in
which one of these constructions was informally described as derived
from the other - in 4.9.2 - appears to involve quite ad hoc case permutations, etc.
[25] The formal identity of instrumentive and comitative verbal
inflections, and the congruence between (242)^253) and (25o)-(26i)

can be verbalised, but not ablative forms (4.7).
[28] The syntax of ajia]a (4.15.2).
[29] The difference in meaning between -gay and false reflexive
forms (4.8.1).
This is not intended as an exhaustive list of points, but rather
a sample of some of the more important facts that are suggestive of
further, detailed investigation. They are presented in something of
the spirit in which standard manuals of *fieldphonemics' suggest1285- 7 Points to be explainedthat, after the phonetic facts of a language are obtained, 'suspicious
pairs' should be circled, and their phonological contrastiveness investigated in some detail. Just as some sounds, which one would guess
might fall together, sometimes turn out to belong to different phonemes,
so some of the syntactic phenomena listed above may not be relatable
to each other. For instance, we ARE able to relate together nominal and
verbal -yu, -mi and -gu> from point [17], but we cannot find any
evidence connecting nominal -bila with verbal -bila; we conclude, at
least in the light of our present understanding of Dyirbal, that the
formal identity between the -bila affixes is coincidental. Similarly, we
are not at present able to offer any explanation of points [5], [18-20]
and [27-9].
The analogy to phonemics should not be taken to imply that there was any
* procedure* attached to our investigation of Dyirbal syntax. Some of the
generalisations of this chapter were formulated before the full range of syntactic
facts had been uncovered; indeed, a major part of the information given in
the last chapter was obtained during the testing of putative hypotheses concerning the deep syntax of Dyirbal.","[149, 150, 151, 152]"
"5Deep syntaxChapters 3, 4 and 6 present the basic 'facts' of the grammar of Dyirbal.
This chapter attempts to interpret, generalise from, and explain the
basic facts; the discussion is thus at a higher level of abstraction, and
is more speculative and arguable, than chapters 3, 4 and 6.
5.1 Points to be explained
In the last chapter we mentioned that certain types of sentence were
possible but that other, similar types were impossible; that certain
combinations of processes were acceptable while others were unacceptable; and that certain inflections which appeared to be rather
different in function were identical in form. In no case did we attempt
anything more than a limited and ad hoc explanation of these facts.
Before we embark on an investigation of the underlying syntactic
nature of Dyirbal, it will be useful to list some of the points from
chapter 4 that appear to be in need of explanation:
[1] The fact that word order is quite free, except in the case of
some particles, and when there is multiple embedding. It should be
noted that it is the order of WORDS in sentences that is free, not just
the order of phrases (4.5.4, 4.15.3, 7-8).
[2] The apparent conflict between the nominative-accusative paradigm of pronouns, and the nominative-ergative syntax of nouns,
adjectives, and noun markers (3.2.1, 3.3.1, 4.1).
[3] Case inflections on pronouns - in particular, the difference between
the inflections on singular pronouns in G, and in D and M (3.3.1).
[4] The affix -pa on nouns - this can occur on a noun in a nominative
NP in O function, but not in one in S function (3.2.1).
[5] The fact that dative and locative forms can involve -pa, but that
ergative, instrumental, genitive, allative and ablative forms cannot
(3-2.i).","[148, 149]"
"5.4 Tree representation of topic-chains
5.4.1 Motivation. We shall now give tree representations (so-called
P-markers) for Dyirbal sentences - see Chomsky [1965], McCawley
[1968]. These will incorporate generalisations that show and explain
syntactic functions, and the ways in which simple sentences can be
transformed, related together in topic-chains, and so on.
In English, syntactic function is shown by word order; in Dyirbal, word order
is remarkably free, syntactic function being shown by case inflection. Tree
representations normally provided for English sentences involve a rigid left-toright ordering of the branches. Now Staal [1967] has argued that in the case
of languages with free word order (his example is Sanskrit), it is appropriate
to use 'wild trees*, that do not involve ordering of branches but are defined1485-4Tree representation of topic-chainsas * configurations of points such that there is one point at the top and each
other point is connected with one and only one point above it' [1967: 14]. He
thus has a first PS rule S = {NP, VP}, and so on. However, 'wild trees'
have at least one considerable drawback - if a certain node dominates two
nodes that have the same label, then it will be impossible to distinguish
between these latter two; the tree will be ambiguous. That is, in the case of
a wild tree involving:
(xxxv)
A
BC Bfor instance, it would be impossible to compare the two instances of B between
two examples of the same structure. This could only be done by introducing
intermediate labels between A and B, for instance:
(xxxvi)
A
D C EBut the introduction of these labels would be exactly equivalent to the introduction of a left-to-right ordering convention, with D corresponding to 'to
the left of C and E to 'to the right of C \ We shall, in fact, want to work in
terms of configurations such as (xxxv) (and we shall employ ordered trees).
Staal's wild trees were presumably intended to generate the words of a
sentence in any order. However, what they would in fact do is generate the
words in any order within a phrase, and phrases in any order within a sentence.
We have seen that in Dyirbal words can occur in any order within a sentence,
irrespective of phrase membership (cf. (321)). Thus, even if wild trees were
used for Dyirbal we would still need a ' scrambling rule' that mixed the words
from different phrases.
It is sometimes denied that any language has such a thing as free word order.
In fact Dyirbal is an example of a living language with an order that is totally
free, with the exception of certain particles and cases of multiple embedding.
That is, any order of words CAN occur (although, of course, every possible
order does not occur with equal frequency). But despite this, speakers are
definitely aware of a norm word order, to which they will more closely adhere
in elicitation than in conversation.
It might be thought that, if ordered trees are appropriate for English, then
unordered trees, that involve case specification from the deepest stage on,
would be suitable for Dyirbal. (xxxv) would be unambiguous if the two
occurrences of B were marked by different cases. This would be a possible
procedure, but it would be unbearably long-winded and clumsy - the many
operations that trees can undergo would each have to be specified for a multi-5.4Tree representation of topic-chains149plicity of case alterations. It is considerably simpler and more revealing to
state underlying syntactic relations in terms of configurations in ordered trees
(the ordering being chosen just to show these relations). Transformational
operations then change the configurations in various ways. Cases are assigned
by a late rule, in terms of the positions of NPs in the final configurations, after
the transformations have applied.
Syntactic functions will be specified within trees in terms of domination, and of relative (left-to-right) ordering. There are a considerable
number of ways in which the nodes can be ordered, such that there is
sufficient relative ordering for unambiguous identification of syntactic
functions. There are no syntactic reasons for choosing one of these
ways over the others; we have in fact chosen the order that corresponds
most nearly to the underlying 'norm word order' in Dyirbal surface
structure (see 7.8). For instance, topic NPs are typically sentenceinitial; we adopt the convention that the topic NP is the leftmost NP
dominated by S.
The ordering we have imposed upon trees does not correspond IN EVERY
PARTICULAR to the norm order of words in sentences - for instance, we are
not able to show within a tree that a pronominal A NP is likely to precede
a topic NP. The correspondence could only be made exact through destroying
some important syntactic generalisation shown through trees. (Specification
of the exact order in which the phonological realisations of grammatical
categories occur is held to be a phonological matter, in the same way that
specification of morphological alternations is usually held to be a phonological
matter, and so on.)
Thus, the output from the syntactic and phonological components is a
sentence in 'norm' word order. We could then postulate a 'scrambling rule'
that re-arranges the words in any order. However, it is likely that considerations
of discourse structuring (' given' and ' new', or ' focus', or ' theme' or whatever
-see Chomsky [1971], Halliday [1967-8], Dixon [1965], etc.) play some part
in determining the actual order of words in a discourse. A discourse-generating
component would thus act on the output from the language-general syntactic
and phonological components, forming a specific discourse appropriate to some
PARTICULAR extralinguistic situation.
We have in this section taken account of point [1] from 5.1.
5.4.2 Transitivity; -yay and reflexive transformations. We can
represent an intransitive simple sentence, [NP, VC], by:
(xxxvii)
NPVP
VC1505.4Tree representation of topic-chainsand a transitive simple sentence, [NP, [VC, NP]], by
(xxxviii)
S
NPVP
/
NP\
VCwhere the NP dominated by 2 in (xxxviii) is in O function, and that
dominated by VP is in A function. (Again, we are leaving aside secondary
categories such as tense.)
The leftmost mode dominated by 2 is in each case the topic NP.
We mentioned (4.3) that a VC can involve any number of verbs
and/or adverbals provided that they agree in surface transitivity (and
in final inflection). The requirement on agreement in transitivity is in
the nature of a surface structure constraint. A verb in -yay form is
surface intransitive (as mentioned in 4.9.3). This can be seen from:
[1] The fact that a -yay form can occur in a VC with an intransitive
verb, but not with a transitive verb. Thus, in text xv, line 10 (p. 370)
we have:
(455) ap4abanyibiq]aranbaligayulPARTICLE THERE-NOM-II WOman-DUAL THERE-TO(DIRECTION)-SAMEband^alyajiu
marin
follow-^Oy-PRES/PAST follow-PRES/PAST
the two women followed the same route
where the VC involves the intransitive root maril 'follow', and the
-yay form of transitive banzai 'follow*.
[2] In G there are different forms of the singular pronouns for
functions S, O and A. Thus, in G :
(456) yad,a bayiya^a banyanI followed manbut
(457) Vayba baygul yayaygu ban^alyajtuI followed manIt will be seen that the S form of the pronoun is used with the -yay
verbal form.
Now:
(458) balan d,ugumbil baygul y ayaygu balgan man hit womanS>4 Tree representation of topic-chains151has tree representation :
(xxxix)balan
(jugumbil""Let us consider -yay constructions in which the O NP is in ergative
inflection (leaving aside, for the time being, those in which the O NP
is in dative case). In providing a tree representation for:
(459) bayiyaia baygun djugumbixu balgalyapu man hit woman
we have to show: [1] that bayi yaya is now topic of the sentence; and
[2] that the VC is now 'intransitive*.
This is achieved if we represent (459) as:
(xl)
sThat is, the -yay transformation lifts the A NP (bayiyaia in this case),
and attaches it to 2, to the left of any other node dominated by 2 ; it
also attaches the feature [-yay] to the VC. By our convention that the
leftmost constituent is topic, the A NP is now identified as topic. And
we can define transitivity:
[1] a VC exhaustively dominated by a VP is ' intransitive'; and
[2] a VC directly dominated by a VP that also directly dominates
an NP is ' transitive \
Now balgal [-yay] in (xl) is, like the VC in (xxxvii), intransitive.
The -yay rule can now be written (see also 5.11.2):1525-4 Tree representation of topic-chains(a) -yay TRANSFORMATIONX£[

(ii) all other NPs are in ergative case.
Thus bayi yaira - dominated by VP - in (xxxix) is given ergative
inflection, as is balan ^ugumbil in (xl), the second leftmost NP dominated
by 2.
Verbs in reflexive and reciprocal form (4.8.1, 4.8.2) are also surface
intransitive. In the case of a true reflexive:
(460) bayi yaya buybayiripu man hid himself
we have an underlying ternary deep relation. The tree representation
for (460) is thus, at the deepest level:

(xliii)buybal
[refl]The VC in (xliii) is now intransitive, and the NP receives the same
case inflection as does the topic in an intransitive simple sentence. The
correctness of this specification can be verified from an examination
of pronominal forms used in G. If there were no reflexive rule:
(xliv)buybalwould presumably be realised by G.

False reflexives involve a rule identical to (a), with the reflexive
affix in place of -yay; we are unable to give any syntactic representation
of, or explanation for, the semantic difference (involving actual and
potential actions) between -yay forms and false reflexives (4.8.1).
Reciprocals are discussed in 5.10.1.
5.4.3 Simple topic-chains. Any two sentences that have a common
topic NP can be conjoined; all or part of all occurrences of the topic NP
after the first can be deleted (4.5.2). Thus, from:
(466) bayi ya%a baygul gubiygu mundan the gubi brought man
(467) bayi ya^a baygun d,ugumbvj[u balgan woman hit man
can be formed:
(468) bayi ya^a baygul gubiygu mundan (bayi) (yapa) baygun djugumbiiu
balgan man was brought here by the gubi and (he) was hit by
woman
This can be described as a simple coordination of S's:
(xlvi)balan
djugumbil155Tree representation of topic-chainsWe now have T[opic-chain] as initial symbol, and a first PS rule that
rewrites it as a string of S's
In order to exclude ^-coordinations that would not be bona fide
topic-chains, a constraint is needed, that must be satisfied by any tree:
CONSTRAINT I: The leftmost NPs in the S's of a topic-chain coordinationmust have common reference. That is, in:
T [ S [ N P X ] S S [ N P X ] L . . . S [NPX] a ] T12
34
2n-i 2n where n ^ 2
the head nouns of 1, 3, . . . , 2n-i must have the same referent. Then,
all or part of that portion of each 2i-i (i ^ 2), that is also included in
2i-3, can optionally be deleted.
The last sentence allows for topic 'elaboration' and 'reversion'4.5.2. In (108) the topics of successive parts of the chain were bayi
burbula, and bayi burbula iudu 'the hollow at the back of Burbula's
neck'; these have identical referents of the head nouns. Only the part
of a topic NP that is included in the previous topic NP can be deleted;
thus the elaboration, pidu, has to be stated in (114).
Constraint I is to be satisfied after transformations have been applied.
Thus, in the case of a coordination:
(xlvii)balgalthe constraint is not met. However, the -yay transformation can be
applied to S2, producing:
(xlviii)yaXa1565*4Tree representation of topic-chainswhich now satisfies the constraint. The realisation of (xlviii) is:
(469) bayi yaya barjgul gubiygu mundan {bayi) (yapa) baygun qlugumbiiu
balgalyajm man was brought here by the gubi and (he) hit
woman
The subscripts to the S's in (xlvii) and (xlviii) etc. are included for ease of
reference; they have no syntactic status.
Note that the PS rules would also generate trees such as:
xlix)
Tbalan
djUgumhilwhich does not and could not satisfy the constraint, (xlix) is thus
rejected as an 'illicit tree' at the stage of derivation at which constraint
1 is applied.
It should be noted that there is no overt mark of coordination within
a topic-chain (such as English 'and'). Instead, ajid,a can, but need not
always, precede the first occurrence of the topic NP, to mark the
introduction of a new topic-chain (4.15.2).
5.4.4 Topic-chain involving implication. Consider a favourite
construction, such as:
(470) balan d,ugumbil baygul ya^aygu wawun bagun nayinbagu walmbilyaygu man fetched woman to get girls up
(470) can be the basis for an iterative chain - see 4.5.5. (Note that only
a favourite construction in which the second VC is implicated can be
iteratively extended.) The main 2, which includes the topic NP, is
plainly balan djUgumbil baygul ya^aygu wawun; bagun nayinbagu
wawulyaygu could be regarded as a complement to the main S. We can
in turn have a complement to this complement, and so on-see (133).","[171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180]"
"1791805-5Relative clauses and possessive phrasesThere are a number of striking similarities between relative clauses
and possessive phrases:
[i] PHONOLOGICAL IDENTITY OF INFLECTIONS. Simple genitive
inflection, -yu> is identical with the inflection verbs bear in relative
clauses. General genitive inflection, -mi> is identical with the inflection
in a second type of relative clause that occurs only in M.
[2] DISTRIBUTIONAL SIMILARITY. Genitive -mi is far less common
than the simple genitive -yu; in addition, -mi inflections occur only
on nouns and adjectives, whereas -yu also occurs on noun markers and
pronouns. As we have mentioned, -mi relative clauses are only attested
in the M dialect.
[3] SEMANTIC SIMILARITY. In M, -yu relative clauses involve 'imperfective' and -mi clauses ' perfective' aspect. In all dialects, genitive
-yu indicates a relation of present possession, whereas -mi indicates
a past owner.
[4] SYNTACTIC SIMILARITY - i. A sentence can consist of just a nounplus-marker and a possessive form-see (102), (322); similarly, a
sentence can consist of just a noun-plus-marker and a relative clause see (304), (306).
[5] SYNTACTIC SIMILARITY - 2. Both relative clauses and possessive
phrases can qualify nouns in nominative, ergative, dative, instrumental,
and locative cases. There is a difference in that possessive phrases but not relative clauses - can qualify nouns in allative or ablative case.
[6] SYNTACTIC SIMILARITY-3. An NP in a relative clause can be
qualified by a further relative clause; similarly, a possessive phrase
can be qualified by a relative clause.
[7] MORPHOLOGICAL SIMILARITY. Both a genitive noun, and the verb
of a relative clause, agree in case with the noun they qualify.
This suggests that the underlying representation of a possessive
phrase be a relative clause whose VC is the dummy verb possfesses].
Thus, corresponding to (cf. (307)):
(488) bayi wayal bayul yayayu bayguntfugumbipubuyan woman saw
man's boomerang5.5 Relative clauses and possessive phrases181we have:
(lxxxix)NOTE: Trees are simplified by the omission of NP' nodes, unless there is
a sister relative clause.(lxxxix) satisfies constraint in, and rule (#-ii) then applies, deleting
the leftmost NP of S 2 . Case and verb marking conventions yield:

TWe can now suggest a rule that replaces the case feature of NP 2 by the
features attached to POSS, and deletes POSS.","[203, 204, 205]"
"3.3 Pronouns
3.3.1 Case inflections. There is a class of six pronouns (seven in M)
whose possibilities of case inflection, qua syntactic function, differ
from those for nouns and adjectives. Superficially, pronouns in D andJ . J Pronouns50M follow a 'nominative-accusative* pattern, with one pronominal
form functioning as transitive or intransitive subject, and another as
transitive object. There is, however, a great deal of syntactic evidence
for the view that both nouns and pronouns follow an underlying
nominative-ergative pattern; this is discussed in 5.2. For the time being,
pronominal inflections will be described in terms of syntactic function.

yanaymbayanaymbanci yanaymbangu yanaymbanuspeaker and
spouseDative and simple genitive inflections on pronouns are morphologically
and syntactically compatible with the corresponding inflections on nouns
and adjectives. Pronouns do not occur in general genitive, locative,
allative or ablative inflection. A genitive pronoun can, like a genitiveJ.JPronouns51noun, take the catalytic affix -(p)$n- and then any further case inflection
(including, in this case, locative, allative or ablative). The full pronoun
paradigm for the three dialects is shown in Table 3.4.
The forms given against a dialect are the most usual for that dialect;
however, forms without the -dji can occur in D (and jiubila does occur
in G) and appear to be syntactically and semantically identical with
the -cfi forms; similarly, -d,i forms do occur in M and, to a lesser
extent, in G. Alternant forms pubald,ina and pubilad,inangu have been
observed used instead of jmbalad,ina and jmbilad,ingu respectively. A
morphological analysis of this paradigm is provided in 6.2.
Normal labels ' first person' and * second person', ' singular', 'dual'
and * plural* will be used below to refer to pronouns.
Dyirbal pronouns are typically Australian - see 1.5. The -$> that occurs
especially strongly in the D dialect, appears to be an idiosyncrasy; it is possible
(although there is no real evidence) that it is related to the -(jt)4in that must
be suffixed to a simple genitive noun or pronoun before any further inflection
is added. G has a special idiosyncrasy (that is not shared by any surrounding
language) in that the second vowel of the second person dual form is -i-. The
* self and spouse' pronoun, in M, has not been reported for any other language
in this area.","[73, 74, 75]"

"1.4 Syntax
The most common situation is for nouns to inflect according to a
nominative-ergative pattern, while pronouns at least superficially follow
a nominative-accusative pattern. That is, nouns have a single case
(nominative) marking intransitive subject and transitive object functions,
and another case (ergative) for transitive subject function. Pronouns,
on the other hand, have one case marking transitive and intransitive
subject and another for transitive object.
In a few languages pronouns inflect in a nominative-ergative pattern,
like nouns. There are also some languages where both pronouns and
nouns follow a nominative-accusative pattern.
Walbiri is an example of a language in which both nouns and pronouns inflect
in a nominative-ergative pattern [Hale, 1970: 776-9]. Hale [1970: 759] reports
that languages in which both nouns and pronouns follow a nominativeaccusative pattern are * found in two widely separated areas: the Wellesley
Islands and adjacent mainland in North Qld. (e.g. Lardil, of Mornington
Island; Kayardilt, of Bentinck Island; and Yanggal of Forsythe Island); and
the northwest coast of Western Australia (e.g. Ngaluma of the Roebourne1.4 Syntax5area, and Yintjipanti of the Fortescue River area)'; see also von Brandenstein
[1967].","[28, 29]"
"4.io Relative clauses103Word sequence is very free for most sentences including relative
clauses. The preferred position for a relative clause is immediately
following the NP it qualifies, irrespective of wherever this NP happens,
in this instance, to come in the matrix sentence; the preferred position
is likely to be used for, say, sentences like (280), that include two
ergative NPs, in order to avoid ambiguity.
In M, but not in D and G, there is a second type of relative clause,
with verbal marking -mi in place of -yu. -mi relative clauses have
exactly the same syntax as the -yu type. Verbal endings are:
relative clause to an N P /
noun in inflection:has verbal marking:nominative
ergative
instrumental
dative
locative-mi
-miru
-miru
-migu
-miraThere is a difference in that -yu endings replace tense inflections,
whereas -mi endings follow the unmarked tense inflection. Thus:root
pinay ' s i t '
balgal' hit'relative clause to nominative N P
-mi type
-rju type
jdnajvumi
balganmijtinatju
balgarjuThe difference between the two kinds of relative clause in M is one
of aspect, -mi refers to an action that is completed, while -yu refers to
something that is still going on. Compare (300) and (301), which
both involve a relative clause to an implicative NP, and (302) and
(303), which both involve a relative clause to an ergative NP:
(300) yad,a yanu bagul yajagu yinda yuguygu balganmigu I went to
the man whom you had hit with a stick
(301) yaa]a yanu bagul ya^agu yinda yuguygu balgayugu I went to the
man whom you were hitting with a stick
(302) bayi palyga baygun djUgumbiiu miyandajiumiru buna]un woman,
who had finished laughing, spanked boy
(303) bayi palyga baygun d,ugumbixu miyandayuru bundjun woman
spanked boy while laughing1044-10Relative clausesAn M sentence can consist of just a topic NP qualified by a relative
clause of the -mi type. In this case the relative clause is functioning
like a simple sentence in perfective aspect:
(304) yad,a babilyajtumi bagum mirajiguI've scraped the beansFurther examples of -mi relative clauses are in text xv, lines 3 and 66
(pp. 369, 380); text xxv, line 29 (p. 390) includes a place name involving
-mi.
D and G have only one type of relative clause, whose semantic range
covers -mi and -yu clauses in M. A relative clause in D or G can refer
to any time but will normally refer to a time not later than the time
referred to by the matrix sentence. Thus (280), for example, could
mean 'woman is watching me, who had been hit by man', 'woman is
watching man hit me','woman saw man hitting me', 'woman saw me,
who had been hit by man'.
Note:
(305) yinda gilu
bant
yaygu

you-SA later today come-iMP I-GEN-NOM food-DAT give-REL-DAT
budilyaygu
carry-7/#y-PURP
you come later on, to take some of the food that will have been
given me by then
Here wugayugu refers to future time, but to a time anterior to that
referred to by imperative bant (together with time qualifier gilu ' later
on today').
A sentence in D can consist of just a topic NP, qualified by a relative
clause. In this case the relative clause normally implies the completion
of the action:
(306) yaq\a babilyayu bagum mirajiguI've scraped the beansThus, in this instance, a -yu relative clause in D is roughly equivalent
to a -mi clause in M.
There are two main ways in which relative clauses differ from
participles: [1] a participle can, at most, involve a verb and its object,
whereas a relative clause can include any number of peripheral constituents, such as instrumental and implicative NPs, verb markers and
locational nominals, time qualifier and particles (see (402)), and so
on; [2] a relative clause refers to some actual event (with, in M, an4*10 Relative clauses105obligatory aspect specification), whereas a participle indicates that some
person is habitually involved in actions of a certain type. (And cf. the
distinction *'-tor/ # -ter in Indo-European - Benveniste, 1948: 62.)4.11 Possessive phrases
4.11.1 Involving simple genitive inflection. A topic NP can be
qualified by a possessive NP, all of whose words are in the simple
genitive case (3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3.1). The possibilities for inclusion in a
possessive NP are as described generally for NPs in 4.2, except that
a possessive NP cannot include a second (inalienably possessed) noun.
The head of the topic NP is alienably possessed (i.e. NOT as 'a part of)
by the head of the possessive NP:
(307) bayi wayal bayul yapayu baygun djUgumbiiu buyan woman saw
man's boomerang
(308) yinda yaygu bayi galbin balgan you hit my son
A further form can be derived from any genitive nominal, noun
marker or pronoun, by the addition of -(/z)</m. Thus:
yaiayupdjin
from yayayu ' man's'
yaygudjin
from yaygu ' my'
bayuldfin
from bayul noun marker (often 'his')
balagarayujidjin from balagarayu 'the two people's'
In G -yijt occurs instead of -yu(ji)d,in; thus yayayip in place of ya%ayujidjin, etc. (See 6.2 for the optional omission of genitive inflection
before -d,in in the case of non-singular pronouns.)
Possessives can be declined in most Australian languages; it is not uncommon
for a catalytic affix to be inserted before any further inflection— 1.6. Notice
that in Narrinyeri [Taplin, 1880: 10, 12] the catalytic affix is -yin, rather
similar to Dyirbal -d,in.
-djin possessive forms inflect exactly like nominals, and it is these
forms, with the appropriate case inflections, that are used in possessive
qualification of non-topic NPs. For instance, an ergative NP can be
qualified by a possessive NP, all of whose words are in genitive plus
-djin plus ergative form; an implicated NP can be qualified by a possessive
NP whose words are in genitive plus -(fin plus dative inflection; similarly
for an instrumental NP. For example:
(309) balan djugumbil yaygudjindu baygul galbindu balgan my son hit
woman1064.11 Possessive phrases(310) yayguna baygul

give-7/ay-PURP
gubi told me to give the man his (i.e. the man's) boomerangs
In addition, any locational nominal may be qualified by a -djin
possessive phrase, with the appropriate locational inflection (3.2.1,
3-4-6, 4.3):
(311) balan d^gumbil jiinajm yaygudjinda mid,ayga woman is sitting in
my camp
(312) balan djugumbil yanu yaygudjingu mid,agu woman is going to my
camp
(313) balan d,ugumbil banijiu yaygudjinyunu mid,ayunu woman is coming
from my camp
Sometimes, if there is no possibility of ambiguity, a possessive
phrase in genitive case, with or without affix -^m, but WITHOUT ANY
FURTHER CASE INFLECTION, may modify a non-topic NP. For instance:
(314) balan d,ugumbil yaygu baygul galbindu balgan (as (309))
(315) balan d,ugumbil jiinajm yaygu mtcfayga (as (311))
(316) balan cfugumbil bani/iu yaygudjin mid^ayunu (as (313))
Informants insist that (314-16) are bona fide alternatives to (309), (311)
and (313), and that they are in no way deviant.
A genitive-plus-^m form cannot take a further genitive inflection;
'the possessor of a possessor' is put in the same form as 'the possessor',
with word order and/or considerations of sense indicating the syntactic
relations involved:
(317) yaygu bulguyu balagadjin my wife's yamstick
(318) bayi ya%a yaygudjindu yabuyujidjindu baygun gudaygu bad,an my
mother's dog bit the man
Possessive qualification of topic NPs most commonly involves simple
genitive forms (e.g. yayguy ya^ayu) although -d,in or -d,i forms (the final
-n may be omitted if -djin is word final) can be used instead.
The writer is unsure of the difference between yaygu forms and rjaygufyn
forms. Two hypotheses have suggested themselves:
[1] That properly yaygu is a qualifier 'my', whereas rjaygutyn is a head in^. 11 Possessive phrases107its own right 'that which belongs to me'. This could at best be a tendency,
since forms of both types apparently occur with both meanings. However, it
does seem that if an NP does just consist of a genitive form (with no ' possessed'
head stated) then this will more often be a genitive plus -fyn form.
[2] That yaygu forms are preferred in S function, and r)aygud,in forms in
O function. Again, if this is the correct underlying principle, there is considerable
deviation from it, both forms being encountered in both functions.
A fragment of a secretly recorded conversation illustrates NP possibilities. A speaker asks to whom a large tin standing some way away
belongs (text reference ix: 92):
(319) speaker 1: gijiabawalwajiwjud,ugiTHIS-NOM-IV-LONG WAY who-POSS big-NOM

The tin has no set name in Dyirbal, and there is no head noun in any

The freedom of word order in Dyirbal can be illustrated from:

(320))In (320) the words are in their 'norm' (statistically most frequent)
relative orders - 7.8. (321) is quite typical of word orders in occurring
sentences and was accepted without question by informants.
After his first spell of field work the author wrote that Dyirbal had a remarkably
free word order, and 'made up J (321) to illustrate the possibilities. A wellknown linguist took exception to this, categorically denied that freedom of
word order of this magnitude was possible in any language, and accused the
writer of exaggerating. (321) was put to informants at the next opportunity,4-11108Possessive phrasesand they castigated the writer for asking a trivial and unnecessary question 'you know that's alright!'. This anecdote is included to show that the lot of
a linguistic field-worker is not always an easy one.
As mentioned in 4.5.1, a topic NP involving a possessive phrase can
constitute a complete sentence:
(322) yaygu balan guda the dog is mine ( = it's my dog)
In this case the 'possessed' is head of the NP and topic of the sentence.
To refer to the 'possessor' as topic, a quite different construction is
used, involving nominal affix -bila ' with':
(323) yad,a balanambila gudabilaI have a dogFurther details will be found in the discussion of -bila in 6.1.1.
The contrast between (322) and (323) is reminiscent of the distinction made
by Indo-Europeanists between 'belonging' and 'possession' [Watkins, 1967].
The proleptic construction, which involves possessive phrases, is
discussed in 6.1.5.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"
"6.1.5 Case inflections. Case inflections can be added to any nominal
stem - a full paradigm was given in 3.2.1. With a few exceptions
(-bu, -ru, -bi- 6.7; -q*an(a) - 6.1.6) nothing can follow a case inflection
within the same word. Sentence clitics (-ma, -riga, -gira -4.16) are
enclitic to the first word of a sentence, whatever it is or whatever its
inflection.
Dative and allative are both realised by -gu in the case of nouns.
There are, however, a number of syntactic differences between the
two case forms:
[1] a noun-plus-^*/ will be accompanied by a dative noun marker
(baguly bagun, bagum or bagu) if it is in dative case; and by an allative
verb marker (balu or ball) if the -gu marks allative case.
[2] a dative, but not an allative, noun can be qualified by a relative
clause.
[3] a dative, but not an allative, noun can be the basis for a favourite
construction.
[4] an allative, but not a dative, noun can be verbalised.
[5] an allative, but not a dative, noun can be augmented by affix -ru
(3-4-6).
In most instances there is sufficient information WITHIN a sentence to tell
whether a -gu form is dative or allative; in case of doubt the ambiguity can be
resolved by asking the informant whether the form could be verbalised, or
qualified by a relative clause, and so on.
Semantically, dative -gu and allative -gu are fairly distinct (translation into
English, where they can both be rendered by 'to', tends to obscure this).
There is, however, an ELEMENT of common meaning between allative and
dative in Dyirbal, as in other languages. Further general discussion of this
point would be outside the scope of the present work.",[260]
"Word order is in many cases extraordinarily free; in many languages
every word in a phrase is inflected for case, and words can and do occur
in any order in a sentence. In other cases there is both less inflection
and less freedom - thus, in Gumbaingar, nouns are always inflected
but the inflection may be omitted from an adjective when it immediately
precedes the noun it qualifies [Smythe, 1948/9: 68]. There is probably
in all languages an underlying ' norm' word order - in this the verb is
usually sentence-final.
Very little work has been published on relative clauses, complements
and the like; it is thus not at present possible to make any generalisations
about these or related phenomena in Australian languages (but see
Dixon, 1969).
1.5 Pronoun
The standard Australian pronoun system involves a distinction between
singular, dual and plural forms in each person. A very few languages
appear to have a two-term system, lacking dual. There are rather more
exceptions in the other direction, where the addition of trial (or paucal)
forms makes for a four-term system.
The only languages known to the writer to lack duals are Maung, spoken on
Goulburn Island, N.T., and Dyabugay, spoken just to the north of Dyirbal in
the Cairns rain forest region. Languages involving trial pronouns include
Anincjilyaugwa and Nunggubuyu, from Eastern Arnhem Land; Worora [Love,
1931/2], Ngarinjin [Coate and Oates, 1970] and other languages from the
Kimberleys; some languages of Victoria [Mathews 1902, 19036, 1904; Hercus,
1966]; and Arabana in South Australia.",[29]
"2546.5 Morphology of noun and verb markers6.5 Morphology of noun and verb markers
Morphologically there are three types of marker: [1] noun and verb
markers formed from root bala- (unmarked, and 'there'),yala- ('here'),
yala- ('unseen'), or from the interrogative root wujidjd- ('where');
[2] quasi noun and verb markers based on root gila- 'somewhere';
[3] demonstrative noun markers based on root gipa- DM, yijia G.

appears to be a lack of congruence between the bala-jyala-jyalaparadigm, and the wujia]a- paradigm (3.2.2, 3.4.5):

nominative is -la- in the case of ba- and zero for wujid,a-; the allatives
are -hi and -It with ba- and -ru and -ri with wujid,a-; and locative is
-lay with ba- but -y with wujiq\a-.
The forms listed above are those that occur most frequently. But
there are variant bala- etc. forms that are heard only occasionally; these
are generally longer than the forms given above:

forms imply an indefiniteness of locational specification. Thus balu ' to
there', implying some specific place, but balaru 'to some place or
other over there' (possibly also implying a circuitous route); and so on.
balayum is used in the first line of text xv and also of text xxv, to
indicate the indefinacy of origin of the main character in each story;
elsewhere in these two texts the form bayum is employed.
This suggests that we recognise roots:
bala-y yala-> yala- and wujid,aand case inflections:
noun markers
nominative - zero
ergative/instrumental —rjgu
dative - -guverb markers
allative (place) —ru
allative (direction) —ri
ablative - -yumgenitive - -yulocative - -ytogether with noun class endings (in the case of noun markers only):
class I -/; class II -n; class III -m; class IV zero
In the case of bala-, yala- and yala- markers there is elision and
consonant change:
[i] -la- of the root drops before ergative/instrumental, dative,
genitive, allative and ablative inflections;
[2] then, allative -ru and -ri become -lu and -It respectively.
The normal situation is for rules [1] and [2] to apply. If they do
NOT apply 'indefinite' forms (that are many times less frequent than
the shorter, normal forms) result.
If -la- were omitted from nominative and locative forms a word of
only one syllable would result; as we have already noted, all Dyirbal
words (except interjections ya and yu) have at least two syllables.
However, ban and bam do occur as variants of class II and III nominative
markers balan and balam (balan and ban, balam and bam are in free
variation; there is in this case no 'indefiniteness' attached to the
longer forms); bala and balay can not be shortened.
Allative -ru is probably related to the -ru that can be added to allative and
locative forms of nouns (3.4.6). It is significant that although we can have
balu mid,agu (' in the direction of the camp') and also balu mi4aguru, -ru cannot
be affixed to balu: *baluru mi4agu(ru). This is explainable under our hypothesis
that -ru is already included in balu. Rule [2] is similar to rules that are needed
to explain other phenomena in Dyirbal: intransitive roots barmiliy and balbaliy2566.5 Morphology of noun and verb markersare certainly historically related to the reflexive (-riy) forms of barmil 'look
back' and balbal 'roll' (9.1.1).
There is nowadays no affix -ri similar to -ru (but see d,ina 'foot' and $nari
'root under water' - 9.1.2).
Verb marker inflection -yum, noun inflection -rjunu, and time qualifier
inflection -mu are quite possibly cognate, being derived from a single affix
in an earlier stage of Dyirbal.","[277, 278, 279, 280]"
"In 5.8.1-5 we have dealt with points [3-4], [7] and [26] from 5.1.
5.9 Minimal sentences
Any Dyirbal utterance necessarily involves a 'topic' noun (which is in
nominative case) and some 'comment' on it. The comment can be
verbal as in all earlier discussion in this chapter, or it can be adjectival;
the types are exemplified in:
(514) bayi yaya yanu man is going
(515) bayiyaia bulgan man is big
The difference between these types can be seen by comparing (515)
with the verbal comment sentence:
(516) bayiyaia bulganbin man has become big
The difference between (515) and (516) is exactly paralleled by that
between (517) and (518):
(517) bayi yapa bulgan wudjipu big boy grew up
(518) bayi ya^a bulganbin wud,ijiu boy grew up, becoming big
The entire difference between (517) and (518), and between (515)
and (516), is that bulgan indicates a state of being (roughly, 'a nominal
quality'), whereas bulganbil indicates an activity ('a verbal quality').
The semantic difference can be brought out in the case of (517) and
(518) through tree representations:5.9206
(cxix)and
(cxx)yaXa

This suggests deep structures for (515) and (516):
(cxxi)
TbulganMinimal sentences5.9 Minimal sentences207and
(cxxii)bayi
yai>abulganbilrespectively.
We are thus viewing (515) as a sentence that consists of JUST AN NP;
within the NP the noun is the topic and the adjective the comment.
Thus, if an NP contains an adjective and there is also a VP or embedded
2 in the sentence, then the adjective is part of the 'topic', as in (517).
However, if an NP contains an adjective and the NP is the sole constituent of a sentence, then the adjective is the 'comment', as in (515).
Support for the above analysis is provided by the occurrence of
gulu 'not* in sentences that do not involve a verb (see 4.15.3). In M,
(515) can be negated by placing gulu at the front of the sentence: gulu
bayi ya^a bulgan 'the man is not big'. If bulgan were dominated by the
node VP in (515), we would expect *bayi yaja gulu bulgan to be
grammatical; it is not.
The three functions of ajiq]a (4.15.2) are [1] to introduce a new
topic; [2] to introduce a new type of verbal comment; and [3] to
introduce a new type of adjectival comment. A detailed examination
of the behaviour of ajid,a, and its semantic effect, thus provides support
for the analysis given here.
Any attempt to formulate a universal syntactic policy on adjectival modification
must set out with the recognition that the relation of 'big* to 'man' in 'the
big man is going' is the same as that in ' the man is big' (in Dyirbal, that the
relation of bulgan to yaxa in bayi yaxa bulgan yanu is the same as that in bayi
yaxa bulgan). There are then two main possibilities:
[1] since 'the man is big* appears in some languages to involve a predication,
then adjectival predication is said to underlie 'the big man is going*. Thus
'adjectival comment' is regarded as a special type of 'verbal comment' [Lyons,
1966, after Chomsky, etc.].
[2] since 'big' is an intra-NP modifier in 'the big man is going' it is also
syntactically this in ' the man is big'. This is the analysis adopted here.
Languages vary in whether or not sentences which involve only adjectival2085-9 Minimal sentencescomment are given tense qualification. For languages - such as Dyirbal - in
which they are not, analysis [2] is clearly preferable. The difference between
(515) and (516) is exactly expressed by the different syntactic statuses of the
comment in the two cases; and note that in addition to tense, bulganbil can
bear the full range of verbal affixes (6.3), whereas bulgan can bear only nominal
affixes. To adopt analysis [1] for Dyirbal would be needlessly to complicate
the description.
In the case of languages that do provide tense qualification for adjectival
sentences there is little to choose between analyses [1] and [2]. If tense is
regarded as a feature applying to a complete sentence, not just to the VC, then
the fact that adjectival sentences are marked for tense is no argument for
regarding adjectives as 'a kind of verb \ If analysis [2] were applied to English,
the copula could be thought of as a * dummy' brought in to carry tense when
there is no verb available. (Russian provides support for this position adjectival comment sentences involve a copula only when referring to past or
future time; if the reference is to present time noun and adjective are sufficient.)
Minimal sentences involving a head noun, and a modifier noun with
some suitable affix, can be classed with noun-plus-adjective constructions; -yaygay 'without' in (106), -bila 'with' in (525), and -yarn
'like a' in (107) serve to derive an adjectival stem from a noun root.
Participles function exactly like adjectives. They can be regarded as
syntactically derived from relative clauses. Thus the surface representation of the relative clause construction:
(519) bayiyaja a]anayu man has been standing
is:
(cxxiii)2095.9 Minimal sentencesWe can give the representation of the participial sentence:
(520) bayiyaia q^anay man habitually stands around
as:
(cxxiv)
TNP'd,anayThus, to form a participial structure from a relative clause, cfanay
(and the VC node that dominates it) are detached from VP in S 2 and
attached to the node Adjfective].
Similarly, in the case of an NP-incorporating participle (4.6); the
representation for :
(521) bayiyaia baygun q^ugumbiiu bunq]ulyayu man has been spanking
woman
is:(cxxv)buncjul
[-Vay]
balan
cjugumbil5.9 Minimal sentences210The representation of:
(522) bayi yaya q\gumbilbun$ul(yay)muya man habitually spanks
women
can be shown:
T
(cxxvi)NPNP'yai'a
cfugumbilbuncjulThere are three important differences between (521) and (522): [1]
4ugumbil is in ergative case in (521) but bears no inflection in (522);
[2] djUgumbil can be accompanied by a noun marker in (521) but not
in (522); and [3] -yay must be affixed to bunfyd in (521) but can
optionally be omitted in (522). These differences are accounted for by
saying that baygun djUgumbiiu buntfulyayu is dominated by 2 in (cxxv),
whereas 4ugumbilbun($ul(yay)niuya is dominated by Adj WITHIN the
topic NP in (cxxvi).
In 5.5.2 we described possessive phrases in terms of relative clauses; in surface
representation a possessive NP was shown as still dominated by the relative
clause 2. An alternative would be to say that the possessive NP is transferred
to the Adj node, as in the case of a participle. There is in fact no syntactic
evidence favouring one of these alternatives over the other. (Note that a sentence
can involve just a noun plus relative clause, or just a noun plus adjective, or
just a noun plus possessive phrase - the latter could thus conceivably be
' identified' with either of the first two.)There is a further type of intra-NP comment, the demonstrative
noun marker, gi/ia-, as in (cf. (101):
(523) giyi bayiyaxa the man's here OR this is the man
for which a suitable tree representation would be:5-9 Minimal sentences211(cxxvii)
T
NP
NP'
Dem
giyiOne final constituent of an NP which has not been dealt with above
is a modifier noun, indicating inalienable possession-4.2.1. Such a
noun can be a comment (and can be qualified by an adjective, although
not by a noun marker). Thus:
(524) bayi yaya gagalumyunu guwu bulayi the man, from the moon,
has two noses
Compare with the construction involving alienable possession:
(525) bayiya^a bayijiambila wayalbila the man has a boomerang
There are no nominal sentences (showing inalienable possession) of
the type 'the nose belongs to the man', similar to bayul yapayu bayi
wayal 'the boomerang belongs to the man', which involves alienable
possession.
It thus seems appropriate to consider an inalienably possessed noun
as a further constituent of NP'. The underlying representation of
(cf.(39)) =
(526) gijian balan ^ugumbil mambu baygul ya%aygu balgan man is

5.10 Set representation
5.10.1 Reciprocals. There are some syntactic processes in Dyirbal
that cannot be fully described in terms of the representations used so
far. Consider reciprocals, for instance. A simple reciprocal such as:
(527) rjali bayiyafa bafalbaialnbaripu we two (man and I) are fighting
each other
could be given deep representation:
(cxxix)bapal(The sequence in which 2X and 2 2 occur is, of course, immaterial.)5-/o Set representation213We could then formulate a transformational rule, similar to the
reflexive rule (y), which would derive:
(cxxx)
T[reduplication]
[reciprocal]from (cxxix). Here the referent of NP 3 is the sum of the referents of
NPX and NP2. Tree (cxxx) correctly shows that a reciprocal verb is
surface intransitive. Verbal reduplication normally indicates that an
action is performed 'many times' or 'to excess' (6.3.4). The obligatory
reduplication of a reciprocal is appropriately mirrored by a deep
representation like (cxxix), which involves two occurrences of the
verb root.
However, a deep representation of the type (cxxix) is less suitable
for:
(528) bayi ya^ard^i baialbaialnbarijiu (all) the men are fighting each
other
If the plural noun yaiardji refers to a group of n men, the deep representation for (528) would have to involve (n—1)! coordinated 2's
(man-L fought man2, manx fought man3, . . . , m a n ^ fought mann).
Such a representation would be unbearably long and clumsy. Another
unsatisfactory feature is that it must refer to the number of men, n, in
the group, although (528) could be understood perfectly well without
any exact count having been taken.
Reciprocals of all types can be more revealingly explained in terms
of set inclusion. We say that any surface structure of the form (cxxix),
that is:
(cxxxi) [NPX, VC1[redup] [recip]]
has the following deep representational basis:5.10214Set representation[i] NPX refers to a set, S
and [2] for every x and y such that x and y are members of S, then
[NPX, [VCi, NPy]] and [NPy, [VCx, NPJ] hold.
This type of explanation could be extended to deal with comitativeplus-reflexive type constructions - 5.7.4.
In this section we have taken further account of point [12] from 5.1.
5.10.2 -gara and -matjgan.","[229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238]"
"Proper and some common nouns (usually, just those referring to
humans) can take the affix -pa> but only when they are in transitive object
function. For these nouns there are alternative dative and locative
inflections, either with or without -pa (note that no ergative, instrumental, genitive, allative or ablative forms can involve -jid). For instance,
in the case of the man's name burbula we have alternatives:
NOMINATIVE (INTRANSITIVE SUBJECT FUNCTION): btirbllla Only
NOMINATIVE (TRANSITIVE OBJECT FUNCTION) :biirbula or btirbulapaDATIVE :burbulagu orbtirbulapdngu3'2 Nominals: nouns and adjectives44burbulaga or
burbulapdygaLOCATIVE:Note that, following -pa, dative inflection is -ngu and locative -yga.
-pa behaves quite differently from the regular case inflections in that
it can be followed by derivational and other affixes (6.1.1); the other
case inflections - with the exception of the genitives - cannot be
followed by any other affix, of any kind.
Nominal -pa is clearly related to, and can better be understood by comparison
with, pronominal inflection -na~-jia (6.2). -Na occurs in many Australian
languages, and behaves in much the same way that it does in Dyirbal - see
1.5, 1.6 and Dixon [forthcoming-b].
Further discussion of Dyirbal case inflections and their functions is in 6.1.5.","[67, 68]"
"10.3 Internal history of Dyirbal
Most words have either exactly the same form between dialects of
Dyirbal, or else a totally different form. There are just a few examples
of words similar but not identical; for instance:
[1] with 1 in D and M corresponding to r in G:
DM bala 4u4al
DM bala 4u4ulG bala
tfurfar
ur
G bala 4^4' urine'
' navel'[2] with y in D corresponding to w in M:

DM
mijiay
M Dyalrjuy bala yupayuyG
mijii
D Dyalrjuy bala yupayi'when'
i
teeth,
seed, name'
It does not seem possible to draw any general conclusions about
phonological change within Dyirbal from such limited examples of
difference. It is, however, possible to attempt a measure of internal
reconstruction from an examination of grammatical differences, and
suchlike.
10.3.1 The origin of noun classes. With the exception of the
universal affixes -ru, -bu and -bi (6.7) and emphatics -4an{a) a n d -ban
(6.1.6), nothing can follow the case affix on a noun or adjective. It is
significant, however, that in the case of noun markers the indicator of
noun class FOLLOWS the case inflection. We can also note that some
of the noun marker roots in Dyirbal - bala, gijta, gila - occur in other
Australian languages but do not as a rule inflect for case in the other
languages, and never carry any information concerning noun classificationIO.J Internal history of Dyirbal353(6.5.1, 6.5.3). Wargamay, the language most similar to Dyirbal, has
a demonstrative root yala, that occurs in locative, allative and ablative
inflection but appears not to take ergative/instrumental, dative or
genitive case endings. (None of the languages surrounding Dyirbal
show noun classification.)
This suggests that Dyirbal may originally have had roots bala, gijia
etc. with a simple demonstrative-type meaning. That it then generalised
the case inflections of nouns to these forms. And, finally, that indicators
of noun class were added, at a rather late stage, to the root-plus-case
forms. We mentioned in 6.5.1 that the -la- from a number of noun
and verb marker forms has been dropped, to produce a form that better
satisfies the stress preferences of the language (and see 10.3.4, below).
It remains to discover from what source noun class endings came.
A full answer cannot at present be provided but we can make a suggestion concerning the ending -m for class III, which covers edible
fruit and vegetables.
Firstly, note that there are a considerable number of languages in
Arnhem Land and the Kimberleys that have noun classes, mostly
involving a prefix to the noun and concordial prefixes throughout the
sentence. Capell [1956: 41] has tabulated class prefixes for thirteen
languages from these regions. Every one of the languages has a prefix
referring entirely or almost entirely to vegetable foodstuffs. The prefixes
have the following form:
mammimu-in 6 languages
in 4 languages
in 2 languages
in 1 languageNote the similarity to the class III suffix, -m, in Dyirbal.
Secondly, note that many Australian languages tend to include a
generic term and a specific term together in an NP. For instance, in
Dyabugay (eighty miles to the north of Dyirbal) a typical NP would be
mijia wawwty involving both mijia 'animal* and wawun 'turkey'. It is
significant that Dyirbal does NOT exhibit this behaviour. Now the
generic noun for 'vegetable foodstuffs' over a large section of North
Australia is mayiy or something similar (Dyabugay has ma: and Yidin
mayi).
This suggests the following lines of development. In the Kimberleys
and Arnhem Land, a specific name of a type of vegetable food was as354io. jInternal history of Dyirbal2L rule preceded by the generic noun mayi within an NP; then mayi
gradually degenerated to become a prefix to the specific terms. The
forms of the prefix in twelve of CapelPs languages (ma-> mi- and m-)
are entirely natural degenerate forms of mayi; mu- occurs in only one
language, and suggests that there has been some sound change in this
instance.
In the case of Dyirbal an NP may have typically involved: a form
bala, gijia, yala etc (in case inflection agreeing with the head noun),
followed by a generic term (e.g. mayi ' vegetable foodstuff'), followed
by the specific name of some particular edible plant. As in the Arnhem
Land/Kimberleys area, the generic term gradually took on the status
of an affix, but in Dyirbal it became a SUFFIX to the bala> gijia etc. forms.
After mayi had been assimilated into the grammar in this way, Dyirbal must
have borrowed (or otherwise acquired) its present generic term for non-flesh
food, zvu4u. Note that the form mayi does occur in Dyirbal, as the name for
* English bee' - this must be a very recent borrowing, within the last two
hundred years (that is, since the introduction of English bees into the continent).
The discussion above is largely repeated from Dixon [1968 c]; see also the
discussion of the evolution of noun classes in Olgolo in Dixon [1970 a].","[376, 377, 378]"
"There seems to be no linguistic advantage involved in choosing one
of these equivalent methods of representation over the others. We will
use the class-label representation below, simply because it is most like
contemporary TG conventions.
In addition to the universal deep relations, (v) and (vi), we have the
universal hypothesis, discussed in 5.2.1, which claims that each natural
language is either strictly nominative-accusative, or strictly nominativeergative. Taking these in turn:
[1] To say that a language is nominative-accusative is to claim that
it syntactically ' identifies' functions S and A. That is, S and A behave
identically under a number of syntactic transformations, etc. This can
be shown:

necessarily implying anything about its morphology (this, despite the
morphological overtones of the name 'nominative-accusative').
Now in many nominative-accusative languages, S and A are marked
by the same case inflection - which is referred to as ' nominative' and O by a different inflection - called ' accusative'. This is the situation
in Latin. Case specifications can then be incorporated into the diagram:

3.2.1 Case inflections. Nouns and adjectives show identical case
inflections; for five of the nine cases, inflections vary with the phonological ending of the stem. All possibilities are exemplified in Table 3.1.

[1] NOMINATIVE (used as intransitive subject and transitive object) is
simply the noun or adjective stem;
[2] ERGATIVE (transitive subject) involves the addition of:
(i) -rjgu to a disyllabic stem ending in a vowel,
(ii) -gu to a trisyllabic or longer stem ending in a vowel,
(iii) a homorganic stop plus -u to a stem ending in a nasal or -y,
(iv) -pi, together with the deletion of the stem-final consonant,
when the stem ends in -/, -r or ~i;
[3] INSTRUMENTAL is identical with the ergative (there are strong
syntactic reasons for distinguishing two cases - 4.9.1);
[4] SIMPLE GENITIVE involves the addition of -u for stems ending in
a nasal, and the addition of -nil for all other stems;
[5] LOCATIVE differs from ergative only in having final -a in place of -u.
Case affixes that involve no allomorphic variation are:
[6] GENERAL GENITIVE: -mi;
[7] DATIVE: -gu;[8] ALLATIVE : -gu (allative is identical to dative for nouns and adjectives;
the two cases do, however, have entirely different inflections in the case
of noun and verb markers (3.2.2, 3.4.5) and there are also considerable syntactic reasons for distinguishing dative and allative - 6.1.5);
[9] ABLATIVE: -yunu.","[65, 66]"
"6 Morphology
6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectives
6.1.1 Stem-forming affixes. There are about a score of affixes in
Dyirbal that form nominal stems from nominal roots; some of them
also function as affixes to members of other word classes. Some of the
affixes are important syntactically - for instance -bila ' with' as a type
of possessive, and -gara and -maygan as coordinators; others merely
provide semantic qualification of the noun or adjective they occur
with. NPs involving certain of the affixes can make up complete
sentences; this is not so in the case of other affixes.
The full functional possibilities of each affix are described below.
The section ends with a discussion of the use of bound forms dayi
galu, etc. (3.2.3) as nominal affixes.
[1] -pa This affix has already been discussed in 3.2.1 and 5.8.3. It is
listed as a stem-forming affix, rather than as a case inflection, because
[i] it is always optional with nouns; and [ii] it can be followed by other
stem-forming affixes, -pa is generally added only to a nominal referring
directly to a particular person or persons - a proper name, or else a
noun used in a particular instance as a proper name.
In the case of a stem of three or more syllables ending in a vowel, ergative
and dative inflections coincide; thus burbulagu is ambiguous - it could be
either ergative or dative. Now a considerable proportion of proper names are
of three or more syllables, and are thus open to this ambiguity. But it is with
proper names that -pa is most used, and the inclusion of -pa can help to resolve
the ambiguity - burbulapangu is unequivocally dative (an ergative form cannot
involve -pa), -pa does not normally occur with common nouns; but the
majority of the most frequent common nouns are disyllabic, with distinct
ergative and dative forms (3.2.1).-pa commonly occurs as a suffix to balagara and balamaygan: the
p drops with balamaygan, so that we have balagarapa and balamaygana.
The dative inflection of balagarapa can thus be bagugarapa, balagarapangu or bagugarapangu (3.3.2). -pa can also occur with noun
markers and interrogative noun markers, but only in the presence of
a further affix - 6.5.6.
[221]2226.1Morphology of nouns and adjectives[2] -bila DG, -ba M 'with- \ -bila can be suffixed to a noun, the
resulting form functioning as an adjective:
(534) bayi yaya yugubila banijtu man with stick is coming
It can also be suffixed to adjectives, and to noun markers that are
already in -jia form, i.e. bayijiambilay balanambila, balamambilaf bala-jiambila. We can thus have a complete 'comitative NP', modifying
a head noun, e.g. balajiambilayugubila bulganbila 'with big stick', from
bala yugu bulgan i big stick' in:
(535) bayi yaya balajiambila yugubila bulganbila banijtu man with big
stick is coming
or else just:
(536) bayiyaia bulganbila banijtu man with big thing is coming
However, a noun-plus-£z7a is only infrequently accompanied by a
noun-marker-plus-fo'/tf (as against a head noun, which is usually
accompanied by a noun marker).
With a nominal-plus-^tf form we get simply -paymba in M, but
-jtalaymbila in D and G:

f we two came with Dyumbulu
Myah qumbulujiaymba banijtuJAs mentioned in 4.11.1, a sentence can consist of just a head noun
and a noun-plus-bila:
(538) yad,a (balanambila)gudabila I have a dog [literally: I, with dog]
compare with:
(539) VaySu balan guda the dog is mine
However, constructions like (538) are not simply the converses of constructions
like (539), and should not be related to the dummy verb POSS (5.5.2). Consider:
(540) rjayguna baygun gudarjgu yazagu/i(jindu bac}an man's dog bit me
This states that a dog bit me, and that the dog belongs to a certain man; it
carries no inference that the man is involved in the action - he could have been
encouraging the dog, or he could have been many miles away. Now consider:
(541) rjayguna baygul yaxaygu gudabilagu baigan man with dog hit me
This implies that the man hit me; that the man has a dog; and also that the
dog assisted the man in hitting me. It is thus NOT equivalent to the English
'man who has/owns a dog hit me*. Whereas possessive phrases appear to
function like relative clauses (5.5.2) -bila forms appear quite unlike relative
clauses.","[244, 245, 246]"
"The nine cases fall naturally into three groups:
(i) those that mark syntactic relations: nominative, ergative, instrumental, dative;
(ii) the two genitives;
(iii) those that give information about motion or its absence: allative
('to'), locative ('at'), and ablative ('from').
The genitives are set off from the rest since they alone can be followed
by a further case inflection (4.11). In 5.5.2 we relate genitive inflections
on nouns and pronouns to the inflections of verbs in relative clauses,
and suggest that possessive phrases are a special kind of relative clause.
Dyirbal cases follow the typical Australian pattern, described in 1.6. Ergative
inflection involves just -(y)gu with no trace of the alternative inflection -hi
that occurs as well as or instead of -{rj)gu in many languages, including Dyirbal's
northerly neighbours Mbabatam and Yidin. Two genitives are not common,
but they have been reported for Gugu-Yimidir, spoken two hundred miles to
the north of Dyirbal (4.11.2).",[67]
"5.8Actor NPs5.8.1 Instrumental relative clauses. In 5.7.2 we explained instrumental NPs in terms of relative clauses involving the dummy verb
INST. In fact, relative clauses of this type can only qualify S and2005-* Actor NPsA NPs - as in (c) and (xcviii) respectively; an instrumental relative
clause cannot occur with an NP in O function.
This suggests setting up a feature [ +actor] that applies to S and A
NPs; other NPs will be marked as [-actor]. An appropriate PS rule
would be:
(cxi) (a) NP -> NP [ + actor]/ - VC
(b) N P ^ N P [-actor]
Now only [ +actor] NPs can involve a relative clause in which the
verb is INST.
5.8.2 Pronoun cases. In 5.2 we showed that, despite the case marking
on pronouns, the syntax of Dyirbal followed an entirely nominativeergative pattern. However, we still have to explain pronominal inflections.
This can be done in terms of the feature [ +actor]. The case marking
convention (/?') applies in the case of pronominal NPs just as it does
for non-pronominal NPs. But whereas the inflections of nouns depend
only on case marking, pronominal inflections take account not only of
case but also of the polarity of the [actor] feature. Thus, in the case
of the first person singular pronoun, for instance (compare with the
paradigm in 3.3.1):
(cxii) REALISATION RULESits pronominal head has the form:
in G

yajiayad,a
yad,a
yaygunaIt will be seen that for singular pronouns in G there is a different
form corresponding to each combination of case and actor features.
In D and M however (and for non-singular pronouns in G) there is
a single form of each pronoun, used in [ + actor] NPs, IRRESPECTIVE OF
THE CASE MARKING.","[223, 224]"
"10.3.2 Verbal and nominal inflections. The discussion in this
section, which is largely concerned with inflectional variation between
dialects, is restricted to D, G and M.
[1] General genitive inflection -mi on nouns and adjectives (3.2.1).
The fact that this case affix has a rather limited distribution - it does
not occur on noun markers or pronouns - suggests that it is a relatively
late development. It was probably introduced into the language after
noun markers had taken on their final, class indicator, segment (otherwise, we would expect to encounter noun markers in -mi inflection).
Note that nominal -mi does occur in all dialects, suggesting that it
was probably introduced into proto-Dyirbal (language A of tree 1,
P- 341)[2] Perfective relative clause inflection -mi (4.11.2). This affix occurs
only in M; it is added AFTER the unmarked tense inflection (whereas
relative clause -yu occurs INSTEAD of any tense inflection). This suggests
that verbal -mi is a very late development, perhaps being introduced
into Mamu after Mamu had split off from Dyirbal. (Note that verbal
-mi does not occur in Gulqay, for example; but it is in Ngadyan - its
presence in both Mamu and Ngadyan could be explained in terms of
diffusion, in either direction.) The introduction of verbal -mi appearsio. jInternal history of Dyirbal355to involve generalisation from nominal -mi, on the analogy of nominal
and verbal -yu.
[3] Verbal ending -ga (4.13.2). This occurs only in M. -ga is added
after the unmarked tense inflection, but (unlike -mi) a vowel, -u, is
added between an -/ conjugation tense form ending in -n, and -ga. We
thus have:
unmarked tense
form-mi form-ga formbalgan
wayjidjin
jiinajmbalganmi
wayjifynmi
pinajiumibalganuga
wayjidjinuga
jdnajiugaIt is important to enquire why the inserted vowel should be -u-. In
many Australian languages a vowel that is inserted - for phonological
felicity - is usually in some sort of harmony' with the previous vowel
in the word [Hale, mimeo-c]. Exactly this happens in Dyirbal in the
case of loan words, when the English item ends in a stop - the rule was
stated in 9.3.1. The fact that -u- is included before -ga, whatever the
last vowel in the verb stem is, suggests that the unmarked tense form,
at the time that -ga was introduced, was -nu in the case of the -/
conjugation. That is, we originally had balganu and zvayjicfinu, with the
-u being dropped in a recent phonological change.
The only other instance of a vowel intruding between a consonant and a suffix
involves the universal affix -ru, when following bawal; certainly in this case
the inserted vowel is identical to the previous vowel - bawalaru.
We are led to the position that, at some time in its history, Dyirbal
formed the unmarked, non-future tense by:
[a] in the case of an -/ stem, replacing stem-final -/ by -nu, and
[b] in the case of a -y stem, replacing stem-final -y by -jiu.
This could be formulated as a single rule, in terms of the phonological
features discussed in chapter 7. We can say that the unmarked tense
inflection involves a consonantal segment, specified only for the feature
[Nas], and vowel segment -u. And that a new segment is formed from
the localisation choice of the stem-final segment, and the manner
choice of the affix-initial segment. That is:stemtense
affix356IO.J Internal history of Dyirbalwhere y ranges over the manner system, and x over the localisation
system.
The naturalness of this rule lends some plausibility to our suggestion.
However, we still have to explain why the final -u should later be
dropped from -nu, but not from -pu forms. There is a straightforward
reason - the future tense inflection is -p on all stems; thus if non-future
jdnajiu were to lose its final segment, it would be indistinguishable
from future jiinaji (in contrast, balganu became balgan, which still
contrasted with the future form balgap).
[4] Future tense inflection in D and M involves the replacement of
stem-final -y or -/ by -p. In G, on the other hand, future inflection
involves:
[a] the addition of -d,ay to an -/ stem,
[b] the addition of -n^ay, and loss of stem-final -yy in the case of
a -y stem (3.4.3).
It is possible that the longer G form is more archaic, and that the
DM form has developed out of this. Note that if the final -ay were
elided {rompinantfayy balgald,ayy we would get forms ending in d,. Now
words in Dyirbal cannot terminate in a stop, and it would be perfectly
natural to change -dj to -p. The -/ or -n before this final -p would have
to drop, since no word can end in a consonant cluster.
This suggestion is highly speculative. However, slight support is
provided by the name guguwup, for a bird whose call was said to be
guguwudj-hexzp is substituted for word-final d, (9.4).
A similar hypothesis can be put forward for the negative imperative
alternation (4.12.2). The inflection is -m in D and M, with loss of
stem-final -/ or -y. In G it is -muy with loss of stem-final -y but retention
of -/. We can suggest that the G form is nearer to the inflection in
proto-Dyirbal, and that D and M have dropped the final -u (and then
necessarily lost -/ before -m to avoid a final consonant cluster).
We thus have the following likely changes:
[a] roots such as bala and gipa take case inflections (this applies to
all Dyirbal dialects),
[b] noun class indicators are added after these inflections (again, in
all dialects),
[c] the appearance of general genitive case inflection -mi (all dialects),
[d] future tense inflection -tfay reduced to -p (D and M only)
[e] appearance of verbal inflection -ga (M only),IO.JInternal history of Dyirbal357[f] non-future tense inflection on -/ stems loses its final vowel (this
change has taken place in all dialects),
[g] the -mi inflection is generalised to verbs (M only).
The discussion above has indicated certain orderings between these
changes: [b] must follow [a]; [c] must follow [b]; [f] must follow [e];
[f] must follow [d] (or there would be no bar to the loss of final vowel
from the unmarked tense inflection on -y stems); [g] must follow [f];
and [g] must follow [c].
We can, rather speculatively, relate the changes to different ' stages'
in tree i, p. 341.
Proto-Dyirbal
(language A)a
|
bProto-Dyirbal-Mamu
(language C)
MamuThe fact that change [f] has applied in all dialects would have to be
dealt with in terms of diffusion. We can date [f] after [e], and [e]
appears to have taken place after the Dyirbal/Mamu split. However
[f] could have originated in any of the dialects (not necessarily Mamu)
and then spread to the others.
It appears from the above discussion that G is more conservative
than either D or M. This would be expected in terms of the conclusion
in 10.2.5 ""~ G probably occupies the original tribal territory, and is in
contact with Wargamay, the Dyirbal group's longest-known neighbour.
It has thus been exposed to much less influence from other languages
than the more northerly dialects.
G has not, however, remained static. Consider the addition of
a locative inflection to a noun marker - yagulga, gijianga - mentioned
in 6.5.3; this is an innovation unique to Giramay (and it plainly postdates change [b]).
We suggested change [a] on the evidence of other languages, which appear
not to inflect bala, gijia etc. forms. The change may have taken place in some
ancestor language of Dyirbal, or it may have been as late as proto-Dyirbal
(remembering that yala in Wargamay does not take the syntactic cases).
Change [b] can confidently be assigned to proto-Dyirbal. Change [c] may belong358io.3Internal history of Dyirbalin the same period, or it may have been somewhat later (after the original
tribe had split) and then have diffused into all dialects.","[378, 379, 380, 381, 382]"
"Third person dual and plural pronouns are more frequently derived
from the singular form than is the case for first and second person
forms. There are, however, forms bula, third person dual, and Tana,
third person plural, that recur in a wide variety of languages in all
parts of the continent, bula is a somewhat ubiquitous form - in many
languages it functions as a simple number adjective 'two' instead of
or in addition to being third person dual pronoun; cf. 1.11, below.
Tana can also occur as an adjective 'all'.
In some languages, predominantly in the central and western north1.5 Pronoun9but also in New South Wales and Victoria, reduced forms of pronouns
are incorporated as affixes into the verb, or into the auxiliary.
For a full discussion of this see Capell [1956] and also Wurm [1969].
1.6 Noun and adjective
In the great majority of Australian languages noun and adjective inflect
in the same way for case. There is typically a system of from about
four to eight cases.
The few languages that lack case inflections are all in or near Arnhem Land: for
instance, Gunwinggu [Oates, 1964], Maung, Nunggubuyu. In most of these
languages verb prefixes provide some identification of subject and object.","[32, 33]"
"3.3.Z balagara, balamarjgan. It will be noticed that there are no
third person pronouns in Dyirbal. bayi, balan, balam and bala are not
properly regardable as third person (singular) pronouns since they
normally ACCOMPANY a noun (although either noun or marker can
occur alone); in any case they inflect like nouns, quite differently from
pronouns.
However there are forms bdlagdra and bdlamdygan (in D and M but
not in G) that have some similarities to third person dual and plural
pronouns in other languages. They function rather differently from
bayi, etc.; they do, however, inflect like nominals. (And see 3.3.3 for
interrogative versions of balagara and balamarjgan - NOT formed on
the basis of the interrogative version of bala.)
gar a 'one of a pair' and maygan 'one of many' are normally noun
suffixes (6.1.1). for example:
(10) bayi burbulagara miyandajiu two people laughed, one of whom
was burbula
(11) bayi burbulamaygan miyandajiu many people (i.e. more than
two) laughed, one being burbula52J . J PronounsIn balagara and balamaygan, -gara and -maygan appear to be suffixes
to the noun marker bala (this would be one of the few instances of
a noun marker taking nominal suffixes - 6.5.6). For case inflections we
get:
either [1] bala inflecting as usual, and -gara or -maygan remaining
unchanged;
or [2] bala remaining unchanged and the whole form inflecting
like a nominal;
or [3] both [1] and [2] at once.
The different possibilities appear to be in free variation:[1]

[3]nominative
balagaraergative
baygugara
balagaragu
barjgugaragudative
bagugara
balagaragu
bagugaragugenitive
bayugara
balagaragu
bayugaratjuand similarly for balamaygan; there are no locative, allative or ablative
forms. The justification for regarding -gara and -maygan as suffixes is
that the ergative forms are balagaragu and baygugaragu (that is, as for
a stem of more than two syllables) rather than *balagaraygu and
*baygugaraygu (which would indicate a stem of two syllables - 3.2.1).
Forms gipagara, gipamaygan, yalagara and yalamaygan are also
attested.
yala- substitutes for gijia- in non-nominative forms; in fact, possibility [2] which would involve gipa occurring in an ergative form, mgipagaragu — is not
acceptable in this case, the ergative correspondents of gijiagara being just
yarjgugara and yarjgugaragu.","[75, 76]"
"4'264Noun phrasesWe have so far dealt with NPs involving two nominal cases - nominative and ergative; and (leaving aside G) two pronominal cases, which
we can call SA (yarfa, yinda, yali, etc.) and O (yayguna, yinuna, yalina,
etc.). These co-occur within an NP as follows:

(46, 51)4.3 Verb complexes
Each verb or adverbal root has a fixed transitivity. There are derivational
affixes that change transitivity - for instance, a transitive root (say,
buybal 'hide'), plus reflexive yields an intransitive stem {buybayiriy
'hide oneself'); similarly, an intransitive root (baniy 'come') plus the
comitative affix, yields a transitive stem (banimal 'bring'). We use the
term 'surface transitivity' to refer to the transitivity of a stem, after
all derivational processes have applied.
A simple sentence can be analysed into a nominative NP (that is, the
topic-4.4.3, 4.5.2) and a V[erb] Pfhrase]. If the sentence is transitive,
the VP will consist of an ergative NP and a transitive V[erb] C[omplex];
if intransitive, the VP will be just an intransitive VC.
A VC can contain any number of verbs or adverbals, provided that:
[1] they agree in surface transitivity; and [2] they agree in tense or
other final inflection (6.3.1). Thus in M, for example (wayjidjil is an
intransitive root 'motion upwards, other than upriver'):
(54) balan maraba warijiu birds are flying
(55) balan maraba warijtu wayjidjin birds are flying up
VCs can also contain verb markers and/or locational nominals, subject
to certain selectional restrictions (3.4.6). Thus:
(56) bayi yaya jdnayiu balay man sat there
(57) bayi yaia jiinajm dibanda man sat on (or by) stone
(58) bayi yaya jdnajiu balay dibanda man sat there on (or by) stone
(59) bayiyapa jiinajiu balay dibanda bulganda man sat there on (or by)
big stone4.3 Verb complexes65Sentences such as:
(60) bayi yaxa pinajtu balay bulganda man sat there on (or by) big [thing]
also occur; however these are, on informants' testimonies, elliptical versions
of * correct' sentences such as (59). That is, in underlying structure an adjective
always qualifies a noun - see comments in 4.2.1.
4.4 Implicated phrases
4.4.1 Implicated noun phrases. A simple sentence can be extended
by what we can call an ' implicated' NP; the words in such an NP are
in dative case (3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3.1):
(61) balanrfugumbilbaygul ya^aygu mundan man took woman
(62) balan d,ugumbil baygul yapaygu mundan bagum mirapgu man took
woman to beans
This involves a third situational object ('beans') in the situational
event (which already involves 'man',' woman' and 'taking'). In contrast
to allative, which indicates just 'motion towards', a dative NP indicates
the expectation of implication of the beans (as goal) in some imminent
action involving the woman (as actor). Similarly, with an implicated
pronominal NP:
(63) balan djUgumbil baygul ya^aygu mundan yaygungu man took woman
to me (sc. for her to do something to or for me)
The possibilities for word inclusion in an implicated NP are exactly
the same as those for an NP whose words are in nominative or ergative
case.
A simple sentence can, infrequently but unexceptionally, be extended
by more than one implicated NP - 4.5.4.
4.4.2-gay constructions. Any transitive simple sentence, such as:(64) bayi bargan baygul yayaygu d,urgajiu man is spearing wallaby
(65) balan djugumbil baygul ya^aygu balgan man is hitting woman
can be transformed into a -yay form:
(66) bayi yaya baygul bargandu <%urganapu man is spearing wallaby
(67) bayi ya^a bay gun djiigumbiiu balgalyajiu man is hitting woman
Here, ergative is substituted for the nominative inflection of the NP in
O function, and nominative for the ergative inflection of the A NP.
The verbal stems are put into -yay form. This involves:664-4 Implicated phrases
for an -/ stem: the addition of -yay;
for a -y stem: the deletion of stem-final -y, and addition of -nay.","[87, 88, 89, 90]"
"3.3.3 Interrogative member, wajia 'who' ranges over the class of
pronouns and the subclass of nouns that have human referents; its
case inflections are similar in some ways to those of pronouns and in
other ways to those of nouns (see 5.8.4, 6.6):

wapuyuNote that, in G, the S and O forms fall together; D and M have
different forms for all three syntactic functions. This is in marked
contrast to the way in which the three dialects deal with first person
pronouns: G has different forms for all three functions, while S and
A forms fall together in D and M.
Note also that wa/ia, which is in D and M the interrogative pronoun
root, is in G the interrogative noun 'what' - 3.2.4.
The distinction between (quoting D forms) wapa — with human reference and mipa - with exclusively non-human reference - is, apart from -pa, the
only occurrence in the grammar of Dyirbal of the category 'human'; -pa is
usually but not exclusively affixed to words referring to humans (6.1.1).",[77]
"4.1.2 Involving pronouns: nominative-accusative construction.
However, simple sentences (in D and M) involving pronouns exhibit
a different type of construction:
[59]604-1Simple sentences(28) yad,a banipu I'm coming
(29) yinda banipu You're coming
(30) rjadja yinuna balgan I'm hitting you
(31) yinda yayguna balgan You're hitting me
These sentences exhibit a typical nominative-accusative construction,
suggesting - on the basis solely of (28-31), taking no account of (24-7)
- that forms yacj^a and yinda be named 'nominative', and forms yayguna
and yinuna 'accusative'.
Only in D and M simple sentences involving pronouns can the ' nominativeaccusative' construction be recognised. In G the singular pronouns have
different case inflections for all three syntactic functions.
The majority of Australian languages behave exactly like Dyirbal, with
nouns following a nominative-ergative pattern and pronouns (superficially at
least) a nominative-accusative pattern - see 1.4.","[83, 84]"
"2446.2 Pronominal morphologyNote that the pseudo-pronoun balagara (3.3.2) forms a genitive by adding
-rju, showing that it inflects as a noun and not as a pronoun.
Note also that -jta is optional on [ — actor] nouns and - since other stemforming affixes can follow it - is best regarded as a stem-forming affix and not
as a case inflection with nouns. With [ — actor] plus nominative pronouns,
-na (DM)~-jta (G) is obligatory and must be regarded as a case inflection.
balagara and balamaygan behave like nouns in this respect.-djin can be added to a genitive form (4.11) and the resulting form
given any case inflection; in the case of dual and plural pronouns the
genitive -yu~-nu affix can optionally be omitted in -d,in forms. We can
thus have either yaliyujidjinda or yalidjinda ' at that which belongs to us
two*. A form yalidjinda is structurally analogous to the -d^in plus locative
form of a singular pronoun, where the genitive formis just the general root.
Similarly, in the case of the interrogative pronoun, wayiud,in alternates with
voajiurjujid/in.","[267, 268]"
"8.5 Adjective semantics
Dyirbal Guwal is particularly rich in adjectives. Not only are there
adjectives covering all the semantic areas described by adjectives in
English, but Dyirbal has an adjectival opposite for many adjectives,
where English would use a verb form. Thus, the opposite of gunga
'raw' is jiamu 'cooked' (which cannot be shown to be cognate with
the verb jiadjul 'cook'), and the opposite of mugulnba 'whole' is yagi
'broken, split' (which is not cognate with verbs xulbal'split' orgayjid,al
'break' etc.).
A particular feature of Guwal is the wide range of meaning of
wuygi 'no good'; this can be seen by listing its contraries, wuygi can
mean ' not good for its purpose' as against djigil' good for its purpose';
or 'old (material object)' as againstgujtu 'new'; or 'not strong or sweet
(e.g. tea)' as against guli 'strong and/or sweet'; or 'old (person)' as
against a variety of terms for 'young woman', 'middle-aged man' etc.;
or 'ill' as against bambun 'getting better (i.e. fatter)'; etc.
There are Dyalrjuy correspondents for most of the important Guwal
adjectives, with some grouping together of concepts - thus there is#•5 Adjective semantics313a single Dyalrjuy adjective corresponding to Guwal 'sour' and 'bitter',
one for 'hot' and 'dry', one for 'straight' and 'good', and so on. Just
as wuygi has a wider range of meaning than any other Guwal adjective,
so its Dyalrjuy correspondent maygay has a phenomenal range - at
least fifty adjectives and verbs in Guwal have may gay, maygaybil or
maygaymal as their Dyalnuy correspondents. They cover 'stale, deaf
or forgetful, lazy, tired, shaky, coarse (not finely ground), cunning,
cheeky, frightened, broken-hearted or offended, ashamed, stupid,
grumble at, feel ill, etc. etc'
In some cases Guwal has an 'affect' verb referring to a certain
action, and an adjective for the state resulting from that action. Dyalnuy,
in keeping with its general parsimony, will have a single item. Thus
(inM):
Guwal Dyalnuy
transitive verb xulbal yilgilmal ' (to) split'
adjective
yagi
yilgil
'broken, split'
transitive verb jiadjul durmal
' (to) cook'
adjective
jiamu durmanmi 'cooked'
In the first case Dyalnuy has an adjective, the Guwal verb being
rendered by a verbalised form of this adjective; in the second case
there is a verb in Dyalnuy, the Guwal adjective being translated by the
perfective form of this verb.
There is another class of adjectives that are analogous to adverbals they provide the same semantic qualification of nouns as certain
adverbals do of verbs. Again, Dyalnuy has a single item:
Guwalintransitive adverbal
adjectiveDyalrjuy
wundiy wurgalbil 'do slowly'
wunay wurgal
'slow'8.6 Semantics of time qualifiers
Dyalnuy classes together Guwal words referring to 'a certain time
away in the past' and 'the same time away in the future'. That is, it
has ganba for both ' earlier on today' and ' later on today' and ganbagabun
(literally 'another ganba') for 'yesterday (or any further time in the
past)' and 'tomorrow (or any further time in the future)'. (There are
also one or two other, more specific Dyalnuy time words.)9 Lexicon
In this chapter we survey the structure of lexical roots, in both Guwal
and Dyalquy.
Dyalquy data supports the recognition of a division between grammar
and lexicon: all members of open word classes-that is, all nouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbals and time qualifiers - have a different form
in Dyalrjuy from that which they have in Guwal. However, all grammatical forms - words such as pronouns, noun and verb markers and
particles, and all affixes - have identical form in Guwal and Dyalquy.
Consider the following sentence in Dyalquy (text reference XVIII:
35):
(683) bawalbi pupmarigu
madjirabiyuguwujidjdgun bagumayganangujialmaruguand its translation into Guwal:
(684) yana buialaygu wujid,agun bagumayganangu Jtalygagu jtinayugu
go and look [to see] where all the children are camping!
These sentences involve the following correspondences of lexical roots:
Guwal
yanu(l)
buxal
jialyga
jtinayDyalquy
bawalbil
jiupmal
jialmaru
madjirabil'go' (see 9.2.1)
'see, look at'
'child'
'sit, stay, camp'The interrogative noun marker wuji^agun, and the quasi-pronoun
balamaygan (here in -pa plus dative form) are common to (683) and
(684). Note that the informant providing the translation put bupal into
-yay form, to correspond to a false reflexive form of jiupmal (on this
see 9.2.1).
Dyalquy interrogatives also support the grammar/lexicon distinction.
The interrogative pronoun wap(u\d) and noun/verb marker wupd,ahave identical form in Guwal and Dyalquy - these roots range over
[314]g.i Structure of Guwal roots315grammatical classes. However, the interrogatives which belong to lexical
classes - based on mijia and wiyama roots - have different form in
Dyalrjuy.
D Guwal has wiyamay/l and M Guwal wiyabay/l; the forms are reversed in
Dyalrjuy - thus D Dyalrjuy has wiyabay/l, and M Dyalrjuy wiyamay/l. Dyalrjuy
mindir corresponds to Guwal mijia i what' in both dialects; both mijtay ' when'
and mijiap, 'how many' are rendered by minay in Dyalrjuy (cf. 6.6).
There are two exceptions to the statement that particles are unchanged in
Dyalnuy. Dyalrjuy rjurjify corresponds to Guwal rjuri in both D and M;
Dyalnuy mumba corresponds to Guwal mugu in M (4.15.3).
In M Dyalrjuy only, the form tjulap is brought in between a noun or verb
marker and a bound form (only) - thus yaluyulajidayi, bayiyulajigalu, etc.;
tjulaji carries no meaning - the M informant said it was needed ' to complete
the language'.
Interjections have the same form in Guwal and in Dyalnuy with one
exception: maya G, yimba DM 'no, no more' is in Dyalrjuy (jagin G, djilbu DM
(4.17).","[336, 337, 338, 339]"
"1405-3 Underlying syntactic relationsEnglish is basically of this type. Information about position can also
be incorporated into the diagram:
(xiii)
' S\INTR[2] To say that a language is nominative-ergative is to claim that it
syntactically 'identifies' functions S and O:
(xiv)
INTR
TRIf this syntactic identification is reflected in case marking, the inflection
that shows functions S and O is referred to as 'nominative case', and
that of A ' ergative case' :
(xv)
V' c ''INTR
TRnominativeergativeSimilarly, nominative-ergative languages that lack case inflection may
have S and O occurring in the same relative position in word order,
and A in some different position.
It should be noted that a language MAY have nominative-accusative
syntax without there being any morphological or word-order congruity
between S and A; similarly, in the case of a nominative-ergative
syntax, there being no necessary morphological or word-order congruity
between S and O. Dyirbal, for instance, has a nominative-ergative
syntax (that is, S is identified with O, for transformational operations)
but S and O pronouns are always morphologically distinct. There could
well be a language with three quite different case inflections (for NPs
of all types), marking S, O and A. Yet the language could still conform
to the universal hypothesis, in that it could SYNTACTICALLY identify
either S with A or S with O.","[163, 164]"
"In most languages intransitive subject and transitive object functions
are marked by nominative case. This is almost always realised by zero
inflection. In a fairly small number of languages -l$a can be used to
mark transitive object function on common nouns and adjectives; in
a rather larger number of languages -Na occurs just with proper
nouns, to indicate transitive object (and, in a few cases, intransitive
subject).
Some of the languages which involve -Na inflection on nouns are listed in
Dixon [forthcoming-b]. This affix is plainly cognate with pronominal -Na,
mentioned above.
There are two common ergative inflections, marking transitive
subject:
[1] the inflection is commonly -gu or -ygu on nouns ending in
a vowel, but is often a homorganic stop followed by -u when the stem
ends in a nasal. There may also be allomorphic variants, in the case of
stems ending in a vowel, that depend on the length of the stem.
Some examples: Waluwara has simply -gu, with no alternants (this being
derived, by regular sound change, from -ygu). Wembawemba has -gu after
a vowel, -u after a consonant [Hercus, 1969: 46]. Kalkatungu has -{tj)gu on
a disyllabic root ending with a vowel, with assimilation when the root ends in
a consonant [Blake, 1969: 33].[2] inflection -lu (with variant -lu in some languages).
For instance, Aranda, in which all stem-final vowels have been neutralised
to a central -a, has ergative inflection -la [Strehlow, 1944: 74]. Note that
Arabana has -ru, a development from -lu.",[33]
"6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectives223A typical topic-chain involving a -bila form in ergative inflection is, in M:
(542) barjgul

threatened that she would be shot with the gun
[3] -baray M 'with a lot of-'. Thus, bayi yibiba banijiu refers to
a man accompanied by one woman, bayi yibibaray banijtu refers to
a man amongst a crowd of women, -baray occurs most commonly with
nouns referring to humans; unlike -bila~-ba it cannot be affixed to
noun markers. A noun that involves -baray is frequently (but not
necessarily) reduplicated.
[4] -yaygay DM, -biday G 'without-', -yaygay can be suffixed to
a noun, the resulting form functioning as an adjective. It can also, like
-bila, be suffixed to adjectives; but unlike -bila, it can NOT be suffixed
to noun markers. Thus:
(543) bayi yaia yuguyaygay banijtu man without a stick is coming
(544) bayi ya^a baygayyaygay bulganyaygay banijiu man with no big
spears is coming
(545) bala yugu baygul ya^aygu fyigumbilyaygaydjU maygan man with
no wives picked up stick
Sentences frequently consist of just an NP, that includes a -yaygay
form:
(546) bala mid,a banayaygay there's no water at the camp (literally:
the camp is without water)
See also (106) in 4.5.1. The form wapayaygay is discussed in 6.6.
Most Australian languages have nominal affixes with similar meaning and
function to Dyirbal -bila and -waygay; however, none of these affixes appear
to be cognate with the Dyirbal forms - see 1.6.
[5] -ginay 'covered with - , full of - ' . This affix can be suffixed to
a noun, the resulting form functioning as an adjective, -ginay has very
restricted use: it is normally used only of' something dirty or unpleasant',
and is apparently used less nowadays than previously. Thus we can
have bala djina banaginay ' foot covered with waterJ to refer to someone
who has been walking in puddles and tramples water into a house.
Other typical uses are d,ud,aiginay 'covered with urine', gunaginay
'covered with faeces' and muraginay 'covered with, or full of, semen'2246.1Morphology of nouns and adjectives(text reference xxx: 7, 10). Note also balan war ay i wurmburginay 'a
bream full of bones (making it a difficult fish to eat)5, -ginay cannot be
suffixed to noun markers, and has not been observed occurring as an
adjectival suffix.
[6] -yunu 'out of- , from - ' can be suffixed to nouns and adjectives,
the resulting form functioning as an adjective; it cannot be suffixed
to noun markers. With nouns, -yunu can refer to location or to time
(it can also be affixed to time words, see 6.4):
(547) bayid,aban baygunmawayguTHERE-NOM-I eel-NOM THERE-ERG-II shrimp-ERGdjupayunugu
a]ayganajiu

eel eats shrimps from the leaves
(548) yaa]a bayi ya^a jialygayunu wucjiman I brought the man up
from a boy
See also banayunugu in text xv, line 71 (p. 380).
A -yunu form is not sufficient 'comment' to make up, with a topic
noun, a complete sentence. Thus *bayibulganyunu ['he used to be big']
is not an acceptable sentence; however:
(549) bayi bulganyunu margibin he has become skinny, from (being)
fat
which also involves the derived verb margibil, is grammatical.
The nominal affix -yunu must not be confused with ablative inflection
-yunu-see 6.1.5.
[7] -bara ' a person or animal who is concerned with - J ; often ' who
comes f r o m - ' or 'who lives at or o n - \ See also 9.1.2. -bora can be
suffixed to nouns, most often to nouns referring to places. Thus from
gambil 'tableland' is derived gambilbara 'person from the tableland'
(i.e. a member of the more northerly of the two hordes of the Dyirbalrjan
tribe). The writer was referred to as bayi landanbara' a person who comes
from London'; and see (105). Sometimes -bara can be suffixed to an
adjective: guyimbara 'murderer' from guyi 'dead' (however, -bara
cannot be suffixed to a noun and to an adjective qualifying the noun).
There is also yalamaynbara ' thing or state which is like this one' from
yalamay 'do it like that';
(550) yalamaynbaragu yayguna yuguygu balgan a stick similar to that
one hit me6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectives225(551) yalamaynbara bani/balgun you can come like that, naked (i.e.
it doesn't matter about clothes)
yalamaynbara is used as a noun in (550), and as an adjective in (551).
The form is yalamaynbara in both D and M, even though the M form corresponding to D yalamay is yalabay.
A -bara form always functions as a noun, -bara is the only nominal affix that
can form part of a noun root, e.g. balan wabubara M * dingo' (cf. bala wabu
'scrub*), balan ganibara DG 'dingo' (cf. gani 'a long way'); bala cjawunbara
G * English bee* (cf. bala fawun 'dilly bag') - see 9.1.2.
[8] -yam 'is like a - ' . -yarn can be suffixed to a noun, the resulting
form functioning as an adjective, e.g. ya^ayaru '[looks] like a man',
gugulayaru ' [dives] like a platypus':
(552) baygun d,ugumbiiu yayguna ya^ayarugu balgan the woman that
looks like a man hit me
(553) bayi ya^a gugulayaru mulmajiu the man dives like a platypus
And see text xxxib, line 15 (p. 384).
A -yaru form may be the complete 'comment' in a sentence-see
(107).
-yaru may modify a multi-word NP which then functions as an
adjective phrase modifying a head noun, e.g. bayi yaya djugumbilyaru
midiyaru 'the man is like a little woman'. In the case of a sentence like
bayi ya^a yaygu damanyaru 'the man is like my son', -yaru is usually
suffixed to the head of the modifying phrase, although it is possible
but less acceptable to have, say, bayiya^a yayguyaru daman 'the man
is like my son', with -yaru suffixed to yaygu. We could also have bayi
yaya yayguyaru 'the man is like someone of mine'. However, it appears
that -yaru cannot in this case occur with both words in the modifying
phrase; thus mbayi ya%a yayguyaru damanyaru is not an acceptable
Dyirbal sentence.
Kerr [1968: 21-2] mentions that Nyigina has a suffix -yaru * resemble, be like'.
Note that Nyigina has a number of other forms that resemble Dyirbal words
and suffixes in both form and meaning, e.g. gijia 'that one' (see 6.5.3).
[9] -badjun ' r e a l l y - ' or ' v e r y - ' . This suffix does not change the
syntactic function of a word to which it is attached.
-badfUn is most commonly suffixed to adjectives; here it can be glossed
''very' - bulganbad,un 'very big'. It can also be suffixed to nouns,
indicating that the noun is indeed a proper description of its referent,2266.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectivese.g. balan banabad,un 'proper water (i.e. with no impurities)', bayi
wayalbadjUn 'a proper boomerang (i.e. made from the correct sort of
wood)'; bayiyaiabad,un 'a proper man (i.e. he is beyond doubt a man
and not a woman)'. -bad,un can also be suffixed to noun markers,
attracting attention to the referent of the noun, e.g. bayimbaa^un 'he's
the one (e.g. that I was telling you about)'; balanbadjun d,ugumbil ^anapu
'a whole lot of women are standing there'. A topic noun plus -badjUn
can make up a complete sentence - as in (104).
can also be suffixed to time words - 6.4.
A form bad,un occurs in Wargamay, most typically following yujia 'he', with
the meaning * that's the one'. It is likely that the Dyirbal/Wargamay affix is
cognate with Gugu-Yimidir -bu$un 'very, extremely* [Roth, 1901a: 25;
Haviland, forthcoming] and Gugu-Yalanji -bad,agu ' very' [H. Hershberger and
Pike, 1970: 802].
[10] -bapa comparative; occurs predominantly with adjectives,
although it can qualify a noun, e.g. ya^aba^a 'more of a man'.
The function of -ba^a is best understood by studying its occurrence
in texts. First (text xxxix) a conversation between J (a speaker of G)
and G (an M speaker):(554) J: ...garifynbudinkerosene [tin]-NOM carry-PREs/PAST

Third (text XXIII: 31) a myth telling how the blue-tongue lizard was
the original owner of water, and of the other animals' attempts to find
where he has hidden it. Each tries to follow but is detected. Finally,
the kangaroo turns to a small mouse and asks:
(556) rjindajyinda midibaia\ baygul gulu buyan
[how about] you? You are smaller [than us], and will not be
seen by him
In each example the object of comparison is not explicitly mentioned
in the comparative sentence; it is, however, quite clear what the object
of comparison is from the preceding sentences and/or from the situational
context (we thus have a classic example of ' contextual correlations' Dixon, 1965). If a comparative sentence is given to an informant in
isolation there is likely to be ambiguity. Thus:
(557) balan djugumbil baygul yafaygu midibaiagu balgan
could mean 'the smaller man hit the woman', midibaiagu being taken
as part of the ergative NP; or else as 'the man hit the woman with
a smaller [stick]', where midibaiagu is taken to be in instrumental case.
If an explicit comparison is needed (that is, if there has been no
previous mention of the object of comparison) the following form is
likely:
(558) ya^a bulganbaxa bayi midid,ilu I'm bigger [than him]; he's
really small
or else:
(559) ya4a bulganbaxa bayi midiba^a I'm bigger [than him]; he's
smaller [than me]
However:
(560) bayi bulgan yad,a bulganba%a he's big; [but] I'm bigger
may also be used.
8-22286.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectivesA sentence may, in an appropriate textual context, consist of just
a topic noun or pronoun and a -bapa form (as yinda midibaia in (556)).
Note the contrast between:
(561) bayi bulganbaia he's bigger [than someone else]
and:
(562) bayi bulgan apd,a he's bigger [than he used to be]
-ba^a also occurs as a comparative with time qualifiers (6.4) and
bound forms bayd,i etc. (6.5.7).
[11] -gabun 'another-'. The addition of this suffix does not change
the syntactic function of a word; -gabun can be suffixed to a noun or
to an adjective. For example:
(563) bayi yaya jiinajtu/bayi yayagabun waypdjin one man is sitting
down, and another man is going uphill
-gabun thus marks reference to a further token of the same type. Not
infrequently, -gabun is affixed to EACH token of a certain type :
(564) bayi ya^agabun pinapu/bayi yayagabun waypfyn( = (563))From the adjective wura 'little, small' is derived the very common
Dyirbal form wurawuragabunda ' quite a considerable amount (literally:
at more than a little)':
(565) balan djUgumbil palygirgan wurawuragabunda
very good-lookingwoman is certainlyand (text xxxia: 3):
(566) walawalaygu bayi wurawuragabunda he certainly danced shakea-leg style well
wurawuragabunda is always a sentence qualifier. (An alternative would be to
consider it as submodifier to an adjective, in certain constructions; the fact
that wurawuragabunda cannot take any further inflection shows this analysis
to be incorrect.)
-gabun plus locative inflection can also be involved in time expressions
- 6.4. -gabun occurs with particle -rjuri- 4.15.3.
[12] -d,aran ' t w o - ' or 'each of t w o - ' . This suffix can be attached
to a noun or an adjective and involves no change in syntactic function.
Thus:6.iMorphology of nouns and adjectives229(567) bayi yaiadjoran banipu two men are coming
(568) balan djugumbil baygul yaiadjOrandu balgan two men are hitting
woman
Compare with the adjective bulay(i) 'two' (6.1.7):
(569) bayiyaia bulay banipu two men are coming
(570) balan djugumbil baygul ya^aygu bulay$11 balgan
womantwo men are hittingThe words in (569) and (570) can occur in any order; in (567) and
(568) -cjaran, like all stem-forming affixes, is in fixed position following
ya[a> as part of the noun stem ya^a^aran. Note that -d,aran can be
affixed to either noun marker or noun but not both; thus we can have:
(571) bayia]aran bayguy balay jiinajiutwo frogs are sitting thereor:
(572) bayi bayguyd,aran balay pinajiu( = (571))but not:
#(573) bayia]aran bayguyd^aran balay jiinajiuHowever, -a]aran can be affixed to both noun and adjective:
(574) bayi yaiad,aran midirfaran baniputwo small men are comingIn (567-70) the affix -d,aran appears to be synonymous with number
adjective bulay(i). In fact, although there is some overlap in meaning,
-d,aran frequently has a ' distributive' sense, contrasting with the simple
enumeration of bulay(i). Thus, in M :
(575) balan bupba bulayi maiudjOranba two swamps, each with mud
(576) bayi bulayi ya^a yirmagabund[aran wurbapu two men, each
speaking two (different) languages [i.e. there are in all four
languages known]
(The use of -gabun in (576) is similar to that in (564).) The contrast
between bulayi and -d,aran is highlighted by the use of -d,aran as an
affix to the number yuygul 'one', as in bayugarayu yuyguitar an 'the
two [people] have one each' (literally 'belonging to the two people,
one each'). See also text xv, line 62 (p. 379) mala^aranda bulay 'two
pieces, one in each hand'.","[246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253]"
"5.8.3 Nominal affix -pa. In 3.2.1 we mentioned that the affix -pa
can occur on a noun in a nominative NP in O function, but not in
a nominative NP in A function. Nominal -pa is similar in form - and
may be genetically related t o - t h e affix -na~-pa occurring in the
O forms of pronouns (1.5, 1.6, 3.3.1, 6.1.1, 6.2). There is also some
semantic similarity - -pa is commonly used with proper nouns, and
with common nouns referring to humans; all pronouns in Dyirbal
necessarily have human reference.
The rule for the use of -pa can be stated (cf. (cxii-3)):
(cxvi) if an NP has features [nominative] and [ — actor], its head noun
can, optionally, take the affix -pa.
5.8.4 Cases on the interrogative pronoun. At first sight, the
inflectional paradigm of the interrogative pronoun appears rather
different from both pronoun and noun paradigms (3.3.3).",[226]
"904-8 Reflexive and reciprocal constructions
Reflexive forms sometimes carry a reflexive meaning:(215) bala yugu baygul yayaygu buyban man hides stick
(216) bayiyaya buybayiripu man hides himself
(217) balan d,ugumbil baygul ya^aygu yamban man hears woman
(218) bayi yaya yambayiripu man thinks
In other cases, the reflexive affix appears just to derive an intransitive
from a transitive stem, without carrying any reflexive meaning:
(219) balam wudju baygul ya^aygu q]aygapu man eats fruit
(220) bayiyaia d,aygaymaripu bagum wua]ugu (as (219))
(221) yadjd bay i guy a wagajtu I am spearing fish
(222) yaq]a wagaymarijm bagul guyagu (as (221))
We will refer to sentences such as (220) and (222) as * false reflexives'.
It appears that all verbs can form both true reflexives (if such forms
would be semantically plausible) and false reflexives.
A true reflexive sentence must always involve verbal affix -riy (or
alternant); it can optionally include the nominal affix -(jilu, one of
whose functions is to indicate reflexivity (see 6.1.1). -q]ilu is particularly
useful to distinguish a true from a false reflexive. For instance, (220)
might well be shortened by the omission of bagum wudjugu and of
(223) bayi rfaygaymaripu he eats
Since people do not eat themselves, the unmarked interpretation of
(223) would be that it is a false reflexive, referring to the eating of
a regular meal. If one did want to refer to a man chewing his finger,
say (as a contemplative accompaniment, not in hunger), one would
be sure to include -dfiu:
(224) bayindjilu a]aygaymaripu he eats himself
Consider a further pair of true and false reflexives, involving the
same verb, walmbil' waken, get u p ' :
(225) ydd,a walmbiyiripu I am getting up
(226) yaq]a walmbiyiripu bagul ya%agu I get (or will get) man up
The true reflexive (225) can be extended by an implicative NP, in the
same way that an intransitive simple sentence can be:
(227) yafa walmbiyiripu bagulya^agu
with man (e.g. to see man)I am getting up to be concerned4,8 Reflexive and reciprocal constructions91(227) could be distinguished from the false reflexive (226) by the
inclusion of -djilu:
(228) ya^adjilu walmbiyirijtu bagul yafagu(as (227))A false reflexive is very like a -yay construction. It appears to have
much the same syntactic purpose - to put an A NP (which is in ergative
inflection in the underlying simple sentence) into nominative case, so
that it can be incorporated into a topic-chain. The examples of false
reflexives given above have involved nominative substituting for the
ergative inflection of the A NP, and dative substituting for the nominative
case of the O NP. There are also reflexive sentences similar to the
other type of -yay construction, in which the O NP is put into ergative,
not dative, case:
(229) balabawal yugu baygul nudin he's cutting trees out there
(230) bayi nudiyirijm yuguygu baygubawal <as (229))
False reflexives are, in fact, syntactically identical with -yay constructions; they differ from them in meaning. A verb in -yay form,
plus unmarked tense inflection, refers to an ACTUAL action; one in
reflexive form, plus unmarked tense inflection, refers to the POTENTIALITY
of some action taking place (see the discussion of actual/potential in
3.1). Thus:
(231) bayi ya^a d^abandu wagaymarijm man is spearing eels
refers to a man who has gone out on an eel-spearing expedition, but is
not actually spearing any at the moment. He may have already found
some eels, and have speared them all, and now be looking for more; or
he may not yet have found any at all. In contrast:
(232) bayiyaia d,abandu waganajm man is spearing eels
means that he has just found some eels, and is at present spearing
them.
Similarly, bayi wugayirijtu bagum djigagu means 'he gives out cigarettes ' - the Dyirbal verb has an ' habituative' meaning in this instance,
exactly like 'gives' in the English gloss. In contrast, bayi wugalyajtu
bagum 4igagu would mean 'he is (now) giving out cigarettes'.
The casual listener to Dyirbal conversation might conclude that some verbs
'prefer' -yay constructions, while others occur more commonly in false
reflexive form. In fact, all verbs can occur in both types of construction and
are governed by considerations of * actual' and ' potential' meaning, as described
above. The impression of 'preferences' is a result of the contrasting natures924-8 Reflexive and reciprocal constructionsof different types of action. For instance, on a spearing expedition one spends
a great deal of time (sometimes, all the time!) looking for eels, and a relatively
short time actually trying to spear them - thus wagay ' spear' is heard much more
frequently in false reflexive than in -rjay form. In contrast, if one goes out to
cut a tree down, one spends virtually all the time actually hacking away at it
- it is not surprising that nudil ' cuty is heard much more frequently in -rjay
than in false reflexive form.
The following sentence, which was given spontaneously by an informant,
includes both false reflexive and -rjay forms of the same verb:
(233) r)a4a bayi buxan rfaygaymariyu guyagu 4ayganayuVerbal inflection -yu marks a relative clause-4.10. The literal translation of
(233) is ' I saw him, who is potentially eating fish, who is [in fact] actually
eating it'. That is, 4aVSaymarivu implies that the man referred to has caught
or acquired some fish and that he is either about to eat it or has eaten it;
d,arjganar)u is then more specific, and states that the man was actually eating
fish at the time I saw him. As the informant explained it in English: 'he is
having a feed of fish, when I saw him he was still eating it \
We can have reflexive-plus-j;#ra constructions, exactly like the -yayplus-yura type (4.5.5):
(234) balan d,ugumbil baygul yajaygu balgan (bayi yaya) buybayiriyura
man hit woman and then immediately hid himself
Participles can be formed from reflexive verbs. For example:
[1] nagay is a transitive verb i break the bank of a river, make a
landslide'; bala daygil is 'riverbank'. A part of a bank that is always
breaking down might be referred to as bala daygil nagaymarimuya,
[2] yambal is the verb 'hear, listen'. Anyone who thinks a lot, or
anyone who listens intently to others, can be described as yambayirimuya
- in the first meaning the participle is derived from a true reflexive, in
the second from a false reflexive. Thus, of a man who is far from home
and is always thinking of returning, we might say:
(235) bayi ya^a yambayirimuya bayi banagaji man is always thinking
that he will return home
4.8.2. Reciprocals. A reciprocal verbal form, that also functions like
an intransitive stem, can be derived from any transitive root by:
[1] reduplicating the root (verb reduplication in Dyirbal involves
repeating the first two syllables - 6.3.4); a n ^ [2] adding -(n)bariy.
The topic NP of a reciprocal sentence must have more than one
(animate, usually human) referent:
(236) balagara bayiyaya a^urgaya^urgaybarijiu the two men are spearing
each other4*8 Reflexive and reciprocal constructions93(237) balagara jtund,aljiunq]alnbarijiu the two people are kissing
(238) balagara rfaymbalcjaymbalbaripu bufoiyga the two people met
each other half-way
A reciprocal sentence implies that one person was subject for one
instance of an action and the other object; and that their roles were
reversed in a further instance. Thus:
(239) bayiyaia baygun djugumbiiu baian woman punched man
(240) balan a]ugumbil baygul yayaygu ba%an man punched woman
are together equivalent to (for -gara see 4.2.1, 6.1.1):
(241) bayi yayagara balan djUgumbilgara baialbayalnbarijiu
woman punched each otherman andAlmost all Australian languages have reflexive and reciprocal verbal affixes —
reflexive often involves -rit see 1. 7. Compare with Thargari, which has reflexive
-ri and reciprocal with main allomorph -dbari [Klokeid 1969; 35-7].","[113, 114, 115, 116, 117]"
"3.4.5 Verb markers. A verb can be accompanied by one of a set of
eight verb markers, that have some morphological correspondence with
noun markers (3.2.2); they provide locational qualification for the
verb. They are:3.4Verbals: verbs and adverbalsALLATIVE OF PLACEALLATIVE OF DIRECTIONABLATIVE
LOCATIVEbalu ' to there
(towards a place)'
bait ' to there (in a
direction)'
bayum ' from there *
balay '(at) there'57yalu 'to here
(towards a place)'
yali ' to here (in a
direction)'
yayum 'from here'
yalay ' (at) here'Just as in the case of noun markers, to any verb marker can be added
one of the twelve bound forms baydji etc., and/or one of the three
bound forms gaii etc., any of which may be augmented by -ru (3.2.3).
In D and G there are also verb markers with initial ya-, referring to
something remembered from the past. Forms yalu, yayum and yalay
are attested but not, in this sense, *yali (the form yali is pre-empted
by the first person dual pronoun - see 3.3.1).
There are also markers based on the root gila - see 6.5.2.
3.4.6 Locational nominate. A verb may also be accompanied by
a noun in allative, ablative or locative inflection, optionally accompanied
by an adjective in the same inflection. Thus we have, from bala miq]a
'camp', mid,agu 'to the camp', mia]ayunu 'from the camp', miq]ayga
'at the camp'. An allative or locative (but not an ablative) form may
be augmented by -ru, with an implication of motion: mia]aygaru could
be, for example, ' [going] along by the side of the camp' or ' through
the camp'.
In summary, a verb may be modified by [1] a verb marker, or [2] a
locational - that is, allative, ablative or locative - nominal, or [3] both.
If both occur they must agree in case - 4.3.
A noun in nominative, ergative, instrumental, (simple) genitive or
dative case is normally accompanied by a noun marker, that indicates
its class. A noun in allative, locative or ablative inflection cannot be
accompanied by a noun marker; it can co-occur with a verb marker
(that does not show class). A comparative study of the morphology of
noun and verb markers is in 6.5.
A noun in allative, locative or ablative inflection could be regarded as an
ad hoc place name; in these circumstances, noun class is clearly irrelevant. The
Dyirbalrjan have a multiplicity of place names - for every bend in a river and
dip in a ridge - often in terms of the type of tree that grows there, the rock
formation, etc. It is frequently difficult to distinguish between an institutionalised
place name, and simple reference to a particular object at some locality.","[80, 81]"
"Prefcace
What follows is a revision of the sections on grammar and phonology
of the writer's London PhD thesis [Dixon, 19680]. The main points
of the semantics section have already been summarised in print [Dixon,
1971]. Further work on the lexicon, and its semantic structure, with
particular reference to the special * mother-in-law language* (2.5, 8.1),
is proceeding, with a view to the eventual publication of a comprehensive
dictionary-thesaurus of Dyirbal.
Since the grammatical natures of Australian languages are not widely
known, it has seemed worthwhile, in chapter 1, to give a brief survey
of some of the recurring characteristics of languages across the continent.
In addition, some references to points of similarity in the grammars of
other languages are included, in smaller type, throughout the description
of Dyirbal.
The grammar is written at two distinct 'levels'. The 'facts' of the
grammar - affixes, their syntactic effect, types of construction, and so
on - are described in chapters 3, 4 and 6. Chapter 5 interprets some
of these facts, setting up explanatory generalisations and describing
the 'deep' grammar of Dyirbal in terms of a number of syntactic
relations and a number of transformational rules. It has seemed desirable
to (at least partially) separate facts from interpretations in the case of
a language like Dyirbal that has not previously been described in any
way. The correctness of chapters 3, 4 and 6 cannot seriously be in
dispute. Chapter 5, however, is far more open to argument. A quite
different set of generalisations, with greater explanatory power, might
well be providable instead of those given here. As linguistic theory
progresses chapter 5 is rather likely to stand in need of revision; this
is unlikely to be true for chapters 3, 4 and 6.
The writer believes that syntax is, for a number of reasons, more
interesting and more fundamental than morphology and is better
presented first. Chapter 3 mentions the word classes of Dyirbal and
gives inflectional paradigms that are needed for following the account
of syntax in chapter 4. Chapter 5 attempts a ' deep' interpretation of
[xix]xxPrefacesome of the facts of chapter 4. Chapter 6 discusses the non-inflectional
morphology, and gives further detail on some of the inflections. The
phonological description needs to refer to morphological and syntactic
points - one criterion in setting up a phonological description involves
maximum simplicity of morphophonological rules - and is placed after
the grammatical chapters.
The grammatical description, and particularly chapter 5, is loosely
based on the transformational generative model [Chomsky, 1957, 1965
et al.]. The presentation of grammatical facts, in chapters 3, 4 and 6,
has been influenced in part by the grammar-writing tradition associated
with Franz Boas, Edward Sapir and their pupils [Boas, 1911; Voegelin,
1952; et al.].
Informality has been aimed at throughout the exposition, in order to
ensure maximum readability. Traditional terms-case names * dative',
'genitive', and so on - have been used wherever possible, in preference
to difficult, unusual or neologised terms. Excessive symbolisation has
been avoided. In particular no attempt has been made to write a
completely formal (transformational) grammar. The transformational
rules that are given have considerable explanatory power (and are by
no means obvious, from the information given in the factual chapters).
A full set of phrase structure rules, and necessary additional transformational rules, can be constructed - by any reader who is interested
in doing so - on the basis of the facts given in chapters 3, 4 and 6.
The description is built around 'word' and 'sentence'; suffixes,
modifying words, and so on, are added by grammatical processes.
Functional relations - subject-verb, verb-object, etc-are dealt with
in terms of 'deep syntactic relations'. Word order in Dyirbal simple
sentences is extraordinarily free-words can occur in any order in
a sentence (irrespective of phrase membership); order constraints only
really enter with repeated iteration involving more than one indirect
object.
Dyirbal has very strong topic patterning - that is, grammatical
patterning that involves several sentences in sequence in a text. This
has been described in a fairly ad hoc way, in the absence of any established
grammatical technique for handling it.
Phonology is regarded as an interpretative component, whose
primitives are systems of phonological features. A phonological feature
has a range of phonic realisation, RELATIVE TO the realisations of the
other features in its system. It should be noted that the phonologicalPrefacexxidescription is less complete than the grammar, with no attempt being
made to deal with intonation or sentence stress.
Informants' judgements of acceptability merged ' grammaticalness'
and ' meaningfulness' (in the sense of Chomsky, 1957: 15). Thus,
sentences that were grammatically illformed were rightly rejected; and,
for instance, the perfectly grammatical bala mic^a baygulyapaggu wamban
'the man is building the mia mia' was also at one time rejected, on the
grounds that men do not build huts. The non-acceptability of bala
mid,a baygul ya^aygu wamban is a cultural and not a linguistic matter.
We have not, as a rule, attempted below to deal with selectional
restrictions, of this or other types.

The three dialects of the Dyirbal language (2.2) are normally referred
to by single letters:
D Dyirbal dialect
G Giramay dialect
M Mamu dialect
D always refers to the Dyirbal dialect of the Dyirbal language and
never to the complete Dyirbal language.
Three deep syntactic relations are referred to by single letters:

object of a transitive verb, for instance balan guda 'the dog'
in balan guda baygulya^aygu balgan 'the man hit the dog'Three abbreviated names for grammatical classes are employed:
NP noun phrase, consisting of a head noun, a noun marker, any
number of adjectives, and so on
VC verb complex, consisting of one or more verbs and/or
adverbals, agreeing in surface transitivity and final inflection,
together with locational adjuncts, and so on

"IO Prehistory
This chapter attempts to do two things. Firstly, to examine lexical and
grammatical relationships between the dialects of Dyirbal and surrounding dialects in an attempt to assess the genetic relationships of
the dialects and to reconstruct past tribal movement. Secondly, to
assess ways in which individual dialects of Dyirbal differ from the
general pattern of the language, with a view to internal reconstruction
of some aspects of past stages of Dyirbal.
As mentioned in I . I , it seems likely that most Australian languages
(certainly, all those outside Arnhem Land and the Barkly Tableland)
are genetically related; we can call this a 'weak genetic relation*. In
this chapter we are interested in whether a pair of languages are
'strongly genetically related' -that is, whether they can be related to
a common ancestor that is considerably less ancient than protoAustralian. If two languages belong to the same 'branch' or 'subgroup*
of a family then they are said to be 'strongly related'; if they are
members of different branches then they are 'weakly related'. Consider
an Indo-European analogy: Welsh is strongly related to Breton and
Cornish, and (slightly less strongly) to Irish, within the Celtic branch
of Indo-European; it is only weakly related to languages such as
Lithuanian, English and Greek.
In the discussion below we will use 'genetic relationship' to mean
'strong genetic relationship'. Thus we conclude that Dyirbal and
Yidin, the language next to the north, are probably not genetically
related; that is, to connect them on the 'family tree' of Australian
languages one would probably have to pass through proto-Australian,
at the apex. On the other hand, Dyirbal may well be genetically related
to Wargamay, its southerly neighbour - that is, the common ancestor
of these two languages may be a latter-day descendant of protoAustralian. It must always be borne in mind that over and above the
(strong) genetic relationships that are discussed below, all Australian
languages will probably in time be shown to be weakly genetically
related.
[330]IO.ILexical diffusion in Australia33110. i Lexical diffusion in Australia
Recent archaeological work suggests that aborigines have been in
Australia for something of the order of 25,000 to 30,000 years. The
people are essentially nomadic, and it is likely that there has been
considerable movement of tribes during this period. A tribe may have
split into two and the parts moved in different directions; one of them
might have merged with a further tribe (when numbers were reduced
due to famine, say), and this new tribe could have then split, and so
on (see Birdsell, 1958, and 10.2.2 below). This pattern of split, movement and merger has almost certainly been responsible for a great
deal of lexical and grammatical diffusion throughout the continent.
A rather striking feature of Australian languages is their apparently
high rate of vocabulary replacement. An account of the vocabulary
of the tribe at the junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers, ninety
years ago, mentioned 'when anyone dies, named after anything, the
name of that thing is at once changed. For instance, the name for
water was changed nine times in about five years on account of the
death of eight men who bore the name of water. The reason is, the
name of the departed is never mentioned from a superstitious notion
that the spirit of the departed could immediately appear if mentioned
in any way' [Taplin, 1879, P- 23\- For something to be changed nine
times in five years is quite unusual, but there undoubtedly always has
been considerable vocabulary replacement, due to this taboo on any
common noun similar to a dead person's name, throughout Australia.
The new noun, to replace the proscribed one, is likely to be borrowed
from the dialect of a neighbouring tribe. (Some tribes, such as the
Walbiri in Central Australia and the Tiwi on Bathurst and Melville
Islands, have several alternative names for some common objects; one
name will be the most frequently used, but if this should be proscribed
then one of the other ' reserve' terms will at once replace it; however,
this type of synonymy is quite absent from other regions - from the
Cape York peninsula, for example.) Thus, if a tribe splits into two and
the newly-formed tribes move so that they are separated by four or
five other tribes, their vocabularies will quickly diverge; as words
become taboo in each of the sister dialects they will be replaced with
items from neighbouring dialects.
If the two dialects have been contiguous for a long enough time,
they will have about 50% vocabulary in common. That is, if two332IO.I Lexical diffusion in Australiadialects move into contiguity and, at the beginning have no (or very
little) vocabulary in common, then-through borrowing from each
other to replace proscribed items - the percentage of common vocabulary
will build up until it levels off at about 50%. On the other hand, if
a tribe splits into two and the two new tribes remain in contiguity,
then they will at first have almost identical vocabularies; as different
words become taboo at different times in the two sister dialects, and
are replaced from neighbouring dialects, the percentage of common
vocabulary will gradually decrease until it levels off at about 50%.
The way in which vocabulary is lost and gained can be illustrated
from a hypothetical (and somewhat oversimplified) example. Suppose
that in a narrow coastal strip, bounded by the sea to one side and
a mountain range to the other, there are five dialects: from north to
south, A, B, C, D and E. Suppose that each dialect has 50% vocabulary
in common with the dialect to its north, and also with the dialect to
its south; except that C has only 20% vocabulary in common with B.
Suppose that in T years each dialect replaces 1 % of its total vocabulary,
by borrowing from its neighbours; suppose also that each dialect
borrows equally (or almost equally) frequently from north and south.
Now of the 1 % lost by C one-fifth will be vocabulary that was in
common with B; similarly for the 1 % lost by B. But of the 1 % gained
by C, about half is likely to be borrowed from B; and, similarly, for
the 1 % gained by B. Thus, after T years the vocabulary in common
to B and C will be 20 — 0-2 — o-z + 0-5 + 0-5 = 20-6%. But for C and D
half the proscribed vocabulary will be material that was common to
C and D; and half the gain will be new common vocabulary; after
T years C and D's common material will be 50 — 0-5 — 0-5 + 0-5 + 0-5 =
50%. The percentage of vocabulary shared by B and C has increased,
and will continue to increase until it reaches about 50%; the percentage
shared by C and D, being already at the stable 50% level, does not alter.
Consider now the other case: suppose that each dialect shares 50%
with its neighbours save for B and C, which this time share 70%.
After T years B and C will now share 70 — 0*7 — 0-7+ 0-5+ 0-5 = 69-6%;
and the vocabulary shared by these two dialects will continue to drop
until it is about fifty percent.
We have thus suggested that the equilibrium figure for vocabulary
shared by neighbouring dialects is 50%, and that after any two tribes
have been in contiguity, as distinct tribal groups, for a sufficient period
they will stabilise at about this figure.","[353, 354, 355, 356]"
"9-2324Structure of Dyalyuy roots9.2.2 Noun roots. Compound roots in Guwal are frequently rendered
by a simple form in Dyalnuy:
Guwal
balan malayigara
balan yigara
bala d,inaguda
balangudaDyalrjuy
balan wurmbu
balan wurmbu
balapimbay, M
balan pimbay, M'scorpion'
' crayfish'
'softwood tree'
'dog'The Dyalrjuy term is the correspondent of the second (head) element
in the Guwal compound, in each case.
Dyalrjuy correspondents of Guwal nouns can have a variety of forms:
[1] We can have a simple Dyalnuy noun, either in its 'central'
meaning, or in a metaphorical extension (8.4.3).
[2] There are a number of nouns plus affix -bara - thus balan
djinbaybara 'something concerned with the ground' is the Dyalrjuy
name for five types of bird, all of whom lay their eggs on or near the
ground; bayi bu^ulabara 'something concerned with the fighting
ground' is the name for three species of willy wagtail.
Other nominal affixes are sometimes involved in Dyalrjuy correspondents for simple roots from Guwal. Thus bayi yalygay 'single man
(beyond usual marrying age)' is in Dyalnuy bayi mupdjUyaygay, literally
'without woman'; similarly balan yalygayngan 'single woman (beyond
usual marrying age)' is balan bayabayyaygay 'without man'.
[3] Some Dyalnuy nouns take the form of participles - thus guydjulmuya 'he who bites a lot' for snakes, ants, mosquitos, march fly,
shark\panbalmuya 'he who pierces a lot' for borer, wasp, hawks, stone
fish; gilgarimuya 'he who jumps a lot' for grasshoppers; yirgupfymuya
'he who laughs a lot' for laughing jackass; maybarimuya 'he who calls
out a lot' for crickets; bayyguraybarimuya 'he who sings a lot' for
locusts, a beetle and a bird; wirygarimuya 'he who scratches a lot' for
scrub-itch (a parasite similar to scabies); yulyimuya 'he who dances
a lot' for a bird; bala nayyuriyaray 'that which has started to be
thrown out' for balayabala 'the flat [ground]'.
[4] A few Guwal nouns are rendered by Dyalrjuy adjectives (with
appropriate noun classification) - for instance: bala pingal 'short' for
bala buiumba 'stump'; bala yilu 'cold' for bala birgil 'wintertime',
bayi yilu for bayigubaguba 'a type of pearl shell', bayi/balan yilu, M
for bayi/balan bilmbu 'widower/widow'.
[5] Some common nouns in Dyalrjuy are descriptive in a way thatg.2 Structure of Dyalrjuy roots325only place names can be in Guwal (cf. text xxv, line 29, p. 390): bayi
mayad,ayulmiyulmi (literally 'grubeater') corresponding to bayi yugaba
'small brown rat*. And in the case of balan yibaymalyimalyi ('firebringer') corresponding to balan badjindjila 'satin bird', the mythological role of this bird in snatching the first fire away from the rainbow
snake is described. Note that in both these 'fossilised clause' names
the verb is reduplicated and the final consonant omitted from the root
(as in positive imperatives): this almost certainly has no grammatical
significance.
9.2.3 Adjective roots. Guwal adjectives are generally rendered by
adjectives in Dyalnuy. There are a very small number of compounds for instance yibayyaygay (literally 'without fire') was given as correspondent of Guwal adjective mu^any '[fire] extinguished'.
Two position adjectives have M Dyalnuy correspondents that are
identical in form but for the final segment:
Guwal M Dyalnuy
bilygi
yalyunday
'on lap, across legs'
ba[ay
yalyunda
' [held] between legs'
Dyalnuy has fewer number adjectives than Guwal, grouping together
'three', 'a good few' and 'a lot':
Guwal
Dyalnuy
' one'
yuygul
jiungul
' two'
bulay(i)
ginaynd,aran
'three'
g^fou D, warapuygul M\
'a good few' mundi D, gafou M
\ guwara D, waraji M
'many'
may a D, djulun M
J
The Dyalnuy adjective 'two' is particularly interesting from a
grammatical point of view; -ginay 'full of and dual -cj,aran a r e normally
nominal affixes (6.1.1). (The insertion of n here is predictable - 7.5.1.)
Note that Warunu, the language to the west of Dyirbal, has jtungul
'one' in its Guwal.
9.3 Loan words
9.3.1 Phonology of loans in Guwal. As mentioned in 8.4.4 many
English words have been borrowed into Guwal, suitably cast into
a phonological structure appropriate to a Dyirbal word. Loan words326g.jLoan wordsdiffer phonologically in a single particular from indigenous words loans may begin with /, other words may not: laymun 'lemon', lada
'ladder', landan 'London', etc.
Consonants in initial, final and non-corresponding medial clusters
in English will be separated by vowels: bala bilayygir 'blanket', bala
d,aruq]a 'trousers', balam q]ugagayin 'sugar cane', bala gurugu 'grog',bala babuligan 'pub (publican)'. A consonant - usually y - will be added
before an initial English vowel: bala yayan 'iron', balam yarijify
'orange', bala yaygid,a or balagaygid,a 'handkerchief.
A vowel will be added after a final stop. The rule for choosing this
vowel appears to be:
(a) If the final syllable includes a postvocal glide y, then the wordfinal vowel will be i\
(b) Otherwise the vowel in the final syllable is repeated word-finally.
Thus balan mid,id,i 'white woman (missus)', balan gawa 'cow', bala
buwu 'fork', balam gaygi 'cake', bala yaygi 'rag'; and bala gurugu,
balam yarijidji.
Generally, Dyirbal b corresponds to English, b, p, v> f; Dyirbal 4 to
English s> z,f> 3; Dyirbal £ to English £, k; Dyirbal dto English d and
(in initial position) t; Dyirbal r to English t (when non-initial), and
some instances of r (when non-initial); Dyirbal x to all initial and some
non-initial instances of English r; etc. Examples, besides those given
above, are dina 'dinner time', bala diyi 'tea', balam burira 'potato',
balam binara 'peanut', bala d^algi^x^, sulky', bala d,uwa 'shop, store',
girdjibi 'Christmas (time)'. Note also the adjective mad,irim 'mustering',
where final -m corresponds to -y in English (Dyirbal stems cannot end
in -y).
9.3.2 Syntax of Guwal loans. Loans are taken into Guwal as nouns,
adjectives or time qualifiers, never as verbs. Thus there is an adjective
waga M, wagi DG ' work[ing]' that typically occurs with the intransitive
verbaliser-wagabily wagibil '(to) work'. The adjective madjirim
' mustering' commonly occurs with the transitive verbaliser - madjirimbal
'(to) muster'. There are, however, relatively few loans from English
verbs; most often the range of meaning of an established Guwal verb
is extended to cover a new type of action.
In not accepting loan words as verbs Dyirbal is typical of Australian languages;
see, for instance, R. Hershberger [19646] on Gugu-Yalanji.","[347, 348, 349, 350]"
"4.6 Nominalisations of verbals
There are three ways in which a verbal can be nominalised. [1] The
commonest is by adding -muya to the verbal stem. The resulting form
functions, and takes inflections, exactly like a nominal.
For instance, from intransitive root tfanay 'stand' can be derived
d,anaymuya '[someone who] habitually stands (a lot)'.
This functions like an adjective:
(161) yadjd balan (fyigumbil d,anaymuya buian
who is always standing around
andI saw the woman(162) yayguna bay gun d,ugumbiiu a]anaymuyagu buian
is always standing around saw methe woman whoHere cjanaymuya modifies balanrfugumbil,the syntactic relation between
them being the same as that between a]anajiu and the topic NP balan
djUgumbil) in the simple sentence:
(163) balan cjugumbil rfanajtu woman is standing
We will refer to such deverbal nominals as * participles'.
Similarly, the syntactic relation between a transitive participle, and
the noun it modifies, is the same as that between the corresponding
verb and the topic NP in a simple sentence. From yaijia^ay ' watch, stare'
we get yaffidjaymuya i[someone who] is always being watched', as in:
(164) yayguna baygul yayaygu yaijiq]aymuyagu bid,in the man who is
always watched punched me
Here the syntactic relation between bayi yaya and yai/ic^aymuya is the
same as that between bayiyaya and yafjidjapu in the simple sentence:
(165) bayi ya^a bay gun djugumbiiu yaijid,ajiu woman watches man
If we wish to have a participle which describes some person as the
habitual agent of some action (rather than as the habitual object, as
in the last example), the -yay form of the verb must be used. Thus:
yaijidjanaymuya '[someone who] always watches', and:82^.6 Nominalisations of verbals(166) yayguna baygul ya^aygu yaip^anaymuyagu bidjin man who always
watches punched me
The relation between bayi yaya and yaffKJanaymuya in (166) is the
same as that between bayi ya^a and yaijid,anajiu in the -yay
construction:
(167) bayiyaya bagun djUgumbilgu yaijid^anajm man watches woman
that is, it is the same as the syntactic relation between bayi ya^a and
yafficj/ajiu in the simple sentence:
(168) balan djUgumbil baygul yayaygu ya^p^apu man watches woman
In summary, a participle that involves just a verb root plus -muya
has the same syntactic relation to the noun it modifies as the verb does
to an NP in S or O function to it; a participle that involves a root plus
-yay plus -muya has the same syntactic relation to the noun it modifies
as the verb does to an NP in A function to it. Participles are thus
formed on a nominative-ergative principle.
Now it is an extra-linguistic fact that one may often want to refer
to someone as being the habitual subject of an intransitive actionsomeone who habitually stands, or sits, or runs, or coughs. Similarly,
someone may frequently be the habitual agent of a transitive action
- he may frequently hit, or spear, or cook. However, it would be rather
unusual to find someone who was, as it were, a confirmed victim - the
habitual object of a transitive action. In fact, it would be difficult to
find another example to go besides (166), which involved a verb of
a rather special type (referring to sense perception rather than to an
action which 'affected' the object).
Thus from balgal 'hit with a long rigid object, held in the hand;
kill' we can derive the participle balgalyaymuya 'habitual murderer'.
This is a fairly well used form - either with serious intent or in joking
fashion. However, very little sense could be attached to balgalmuya
'someone who is habitually killed'. Similar comments apply in the
case of the great majority of transitive verb roots; there simply would
not be any use for 'habitual object' participles.
In view of this, participles of the form balgalyaymuya are frequently
shortened by the omission of -yay-, balgalmuya, as actually used, is
thus a free variant of balgalyaymuya 'murderer'. Generally, in the
case of verbs where the 'habitual object' sense is clearly unlikely, the
'habitual agent' form will more frequently occur without -yay than4.6 Nominalisations of verbals83with it; that is, balgalmuya will be encountered more frequently than
balgalyaymuya.
This might lead a casual observer to conclude that the formation of participles
followed a nominative-accusative pattern, against the predominant * nominativeergative pattern* in the rest of the grammar. But consideration of verbs like
rjaxji4ay> a n d the fact that informants regard balgalmuya as a shortened form
of balgalyaymuya, indicates that participles conform to the nominative-ergative
principle.
A participle such as balgal(yay)muya indicates a person who habitually
undertakes a certain type of action, i.e. killing; it gives no information
about the object of the action. There is a further type of participle
that includes information about the object; it simply compounds object
and verb, in that order. Thus, from bundjul 'hit with a long flexible
object, e.g. spank with the flat of the hand* we get bun^ulmuya
'[someone who] habitually spanks', and ^ugumbilbundjulmuya '[someone
who] habitually spanks women', as in:
(169) bayi yaia djUgumbilbundjUlmuya banipu
spanks women is comingthe man who habituallyNote that, by discourse ellipsis, bayiya^a might be omitted from (169),
producing:
(170) ^ugumbilbun^ulmuya banipu woman-spanker is coming
Compare with:
(171) balan d,ugumbil bundjulmuya banipu the woman who habitually
spanks is coming
in which djUgumbil is head of the NP. Discourse ellipsis might well omit
the balany producing:
(172) cjfUgumbil bundjulmuya banipuspanking woman is comingThe two sentences (170) and (172) might easily be confused; their
stress patterns are identical.
However, confusion would never arise if the participles were, say,
in ergative case. Thus:
(173) yayguna baygul yayaygu $ugumbilbun$ulmuyagu mundan the
woman-spanking man took me
(174) yayguna bay gun rfugumbipu bund,ulmuyagu mundan the spanking
woman took me84^.6 Nominalisations of verbalsWith discourse ellipsis omitting baygul yayaygu in (173) and baygun in
(174) we would get:
(175) yayguna a]ugumbilbunq]ulmuyagu mundan woman-spanker took me
(176) yayguna <%ugumbiiu buncj/ulmuyagu mundan spanking woman took
me
The fact that q]ugumbil is in ergative inflection in (176) indicates that it
is a free word, the head of the A N P ; the fact that there is no inflection
on djUgumbil'vsx (175) indicates that it is the first morpheme in a compound
participle.
The difference between sentences of the form (175) and (176) is brought out
most effectively with the verb wadil 'swive (i.e. have sexual intercourse with)'.
Compare:
(177) yayguna baygul yaxaygu wadilmurjagu balgan
(178) yayguna barjgul yaxawadilmurjagu balganThe first of these indicates * I was hit by a man who habitually swives [women]'
(a fuller specification would have been:
(179) yayguna barjgul yaiaygu cfugumbilwadilmuyagu balgan)
In contrast, (178) can only mean ' I was hit by the man-swiving man - that is,
by a homosexual*. (Homosexuality was unknown to the Dyirbalrjan before
white contact, and the reaction of informants was that (178) was nonsensical
- or, that if such a man did exist, he should be killed.)
A participle may refer to something inanimate. Thus, from transitive
gimbil 'blow (as of wind)', we may form gimbilyaymuya 'that which
blows a lot'; this can modify balagulubu iwind':
(180) bala gulubu gimbilyaymuya the wind which blows a lot
or, the shorter form:
(181) bala gulubu gimbilmuya(as (180))Just as a verb complex may contain a verb and an adverbal, so may
a noun be modified by a participial verb and a participial adverbal for instance, corresponding to simple sentence:
(182) balamwud,ubaygulyayaygu a]aygajiuTHERE-NOM-III food-NOM THERE-ERG-I man-ERG eat-PRES/PASTganbin
do badly-PREs/PAST
man eats food sloppily
we can have:
(183) bayiya^a cjayganaymuya ganbilmuya banijiu man who is a sloppy
eater is coming4-6 Nominalisations of verbals85Note that -yay can optionally be omitted from a]ayganaymuya\ it
would almost always be omitted from the adverbal participle, as in
(183), on the principle that it would be unnecessarily redundant to
include -yay twice.
We have thus far described participles involving -muya. There are
two other types:
[2] a verbal stem by itself can function as a participle. This appears
to be a little less strong than a -muya form. Thus:
' [someone who] habitually stands'
djOnaymuya ' [someone who] habitually stands a lot*
A transitive simple stem participle MUST be compounded with an
object noun. Thus we can have:
(184) yayguna baygul yapabalgapu bupan he, who habitually murders
men, saw me
but not:
^(185) yayguna baygulyayaygu balgayu buyan
In M both stem and sttm-\Aus-muya forms are common; in D, while
both do occur, stem-plus-muya forms are far more frequent, and are
preferred.
[3] there are also participles involving a verbal root and suffix
-ginay, e.g. tfanayginay. This may be a dialectal form only: -ginay
appears to have been the most common participial type in the Gulrjay
dialect; it occurs in M but is less used than the -muya type; it is not
used at all in D.
Participial -ginay is almost certainly related to the nominal affix
-ginay 'full of, covered with'-6.1.1. There is a number adjective
muya 'many' (6.1.7) which may or may not be historically related to
participial -muya.
Note that participles can modify pronouns, just as they do nouns:
(186) balan cfugumbil yaq]a QanaydjU balgan whilst standing (as I
habitually do), I hit woman4.7Verbalisations4.7.1Of nominate. Any noun or adjective may be verbalised in two864-7 Verbalisationsdistinct ways:
[i] it may be transformed into an intransitive verbal stem by the
addition of -bil;
or [2] it may be transformed into a transitive verbal stem by the
addition of: -mal to a stem of two syllables; -{m)bal to a stem
of more than two syllables.
Thus from noun waju 'bend' we can derive transitive verbal stem
wa^umal 'make bendy'; from the reduplicated form waiuwaju 'many
bends' is derived waiuwaiubal 'make very bendy'.
We can have:
(187) bayi yaya bulganbin the man has become big (i.e. has grown
big recently)
as well as (4.5.1):
(188) bayi yapa bulgan the man is big
The difference between (187) and (188) lies entirely in the active/
stative contrast (in the traditional sense) between verbal form bulganbil
in (187) and nominal form bulgan in (188) - see 5.9.
A typical verbalisation involves adjective wuygi 'no good':
(189) yad,a wuygibinI feel illVerbalised adjectives are encountered more often than verbalised
nouns, but any noun can be (transitively or intransitively) verbalised:
(190) balamila
wumabin
THERE-NOM-IV clearing-NOM undergrowth-iNTR VBLSR-PRES/PAST
the thick scrub is growing back into the clearing
(191) yaygu daman baryanbin my son has become a youth (i.e. has
passed through puberty)
As another example, 4uSumbilbil 'become a woman' literally implies change
of sex (the process of growing up to womanhood would be described through
the term for 'adolescent girl', as in (191)). There is a Dyirbalrjan hermaphrodite
— although nominally a man, he is said to have underdeveloped genitals, and
has rather pronounced breasts; as he has grown older his feminine characteristics
have become more noticeable. It is said of him, in a semi-joking way: bayi
djUgumbilbin.","[105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110]"
"6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectives235There appear to be no dual forms referring to two people who are in
yalbanjgalbin or gaya/daman relation.
Reduplication of the root part of a -d,ir or -gir dual implies inclusion
of more than one member of the younger generation in a pair. Thus
yagiyagidjir is 'a man, together with two or more of his daughter's
children', yumayumaygir is 'a man, together with two or more of his
own, or of his elder brother's, children'.
The noun class of a -a]ir or -gir form depends on the sex of the
member of the OLDER generation; thus ginaginagir might refer to a
woman accompanied by her six sons, but would always take noun
marker balan.
-d,irj-gir can be followed by some, but not all, nominal affixes, e.g.
yagidjirbila, yagidjirbadjun but not %yagid,ir^aran.
There is nothing unusual in an Australian language having kinship-determined
affixes; as mentioned in 1.5, a number of languages have several sets of pronouns,
depending on the relationship of the people referred to.6.1.4 gayul. -gayul occurs in D as a stem-forming affix only in stems
that receive a locational (allative, ablative or locative) case inflection:
mid,agayuia 'at the same camp', mid,agayulgu 'to the same camp',
miq]agayulyunu 'from the same camp'. A nominal-plus-£#yz// stem
cannot occur in a non-locational inflection in D; we cannot have, for
example :
*(594) yayguna baygul ya^agayufu balgan the same man hit me
It appears that in M stems involving -gayul can receive ANY case
inflection; thus (594) is an acceptable sentence in M (and appears to
be synonymous with (595)).
gayul also occurs in both D and M as a particle, to indicate that an
action is repeated with the same actor (if an intransitive action) or
actor and goal (if a transitive action):
(595) yayguna baygul y ayaygu gayul balgan the same man hit me again
(596) bayi gayul yaya banijiu the same man is coming again
As a particle gayul can occur anywhere before the verb.
-gayul thus marks reference to the same token of the same type - it
contrasts with -gabun 'another', 6.1.1.
The behaviour of gayul tends to support the view that Dyirbal is gradually
getting more ' synthetic' (in terms of the general view that modern Australian2366.1Morphology of nouns and adjectiveslanguages have evolved from an ancestor that was considerably less synthetic
- 1.12). gayul appears to be gradually acquiring the status of an affix, and
has moved further in this direction in M than in D.","[258, 259, 260]"
"2586.$ Morphology of noun and verb markersRoots gijia- and bala- both occur (roughly, as third person singular pronouns)
in Garadjari, in north-west Western Australia [Capell, 1962 a: 69]. gijta- also
occurs in Nyigina, to the north of Garadjari [Kerr, 1968: 30]; note that
Nyigina also has affix -yaru 'like a - ' that may be cognate with Dyirbal
yaru-6.1.1. Lardil also has demonstrative gi:n 'that' (in Lardil, underlying
forms cannot end in -ji); and Mbabaram rjgiji 'there'.
Hercus [1969: 58] lists nine demonstrative pronouns for Wembawemba.
She does not provide any morphological analysis of the nine forms, but six
of these pronouns can be arranged in a suggestive paradigm:
gijia ' this one right here',
expressing close proximity to the
speakergila 'this one now', tending to
have a temporal meaningjiujia 'this one in the vicinity'jiula 'this one then', usually,
not always, having a temporal
nuance implying the immediate
pastmajta ' that one', ' that one some
distance away and out of sight'mala ' that one quite a long way
off, in space or in time'We can analyse these forms into two elements. The first element is either
gi- 'near', jiu- 'mid-distance' or ma- 'far'. The second element is -jta, referring to location, or -la which appears to have primary reference to time.
Of the Wembawemba forms gijia and gila are clearly cognate with two of
the noun marker roots in Dyirbal. However, since the rest of the paradigm
is lacking in Dyirbal, it is not possible in Dyirbal to support an analysis of
gipa and gila, as it is in Wembawemba.
G has a set of demonstrative markers based on the root yijia that
occur in nominative and locative inflections:nominative
locativeclass Iclass IIclass IIIclass IVrjiyi
yiyiygayijian
yipangarjijiam
yijiamgaVVtaNote that the locative inflection -(rj)ga is added AFTER class inflections.
We can thus have, for instance, yijiaga wajiayga 'what is it that [the
topic of the sentence] is at?'; and so on.
In addition, locative inflection can be added to (at least nominative
and dative) noun markers, in G (but not in D or M): bayiyga, yagulga,
etc.
G demonstrative markers and noun markers in locative inflection
are translation equivalents of gila forms in D and M. Specific instances
of translation equivalences given by informants are:6.$ Morphology of noun and verb markers259GDyagulga

the G equivalent is. The absence of class indication in nominative
gila forms makes it sometimes necessary for two words to be used in
D where one will do in G - as in the second example above.
Locative inflection, -ga, can also be added to verb markers in G:
there are forms yalugay balayga, and so on. The D translation equivalent
of baluga is just balaruy that of balayga is balayunda (for -yunda see
6.5.6). The -ga appears to indicate that the state of motion or position
took place 'at' some place; in many cases -ga appears to add a degree of
indefiniteness (of location) to a verb marker.

'for that which is from up there in the slippery blue fig tree*. However,
syntactically and semantically there are similarities between barjunday forms

9-22606.$ Morphology of noun and verb markers6.5.5 Reduplication. Any noun or verb marker, whether based on
root bala-, yala-, gipa-jyipa-, yala- or gila- (and whether or not bearing
any bound affix bayq]i etc.) can be reduplicated; in this case the reduplication involves repetition of the first two syllables of the form
and appears to have the semantic effect of intensification: yalay 'here',
yalayalay ' right here'; bayinbayi G, bayimbayi DM 'he himself; and
also gilagilaruy balaymbalay, yayguyaygumaygandufbalubalubaydjuy andso on.
Affixes to noun and verb markers, including the bound forms baydji,
gait etc., cannot be reduplicated.
Two, slightly different, verb markers can occur together, for stylistic emphasis;
thus baliyalugalumban in text xxv, line 54, p. 392. Markers can only occur together if they show the same case - both bali and yalu are allatives, the
difference being that bali is a * direction' allative and yalu a * place' form, and
that bali is the * there (or unmarked)' marker whereas yalu refers to 'here'.","[281, 282, 283, 284]"
"2466.2 Pronominal morphologyIn D, the plural pronouns can be reduplicated, in a kind of joking
exaggeration: yanayanafy 'all of us' (text reference ix. 41) and
purapuracfi.
Affixes -bacfun, -a]ilu^ d,an(a), -ru, -bu and -bi can be added to
pronouns, the affix always following the case inflections. The only
noted instance of two affixes to the same pronoun involves -djilu and
-bu; then the order is -budjilu (the same order as with noun markers, but
the opposite of that with nouns).
6.3 Verbal morphology
6.3.1 Verbal word structure. Each verbal word (whether verb or
adverbal) must involve [i] a root, and [ii] a final inflectional ending.
Between these constituents can occur:
[1] -yay, 4.4.2
[2] reciprocal -nbariy, 4.8.2
[3] aspectual affixes -galiy~ -nbal; or -yaray; or -ganiy, 6.3.2
[4] aspectual affix -(jay, 6.3.2
[5] reflexive -riy ~ -yiriy ~ -mariy, 4.8.1
[6] comitative/instrumentive -mal~ -mbal, 4.9
At first sight there appears to be no strict ordering between these
affixes. Thus we get [4] both before and after [6] - nudil^ayman and
nudilmalfapu - and [5] both before and after [6] - buybayirimban and
pinaymaripu. Further, we can get a verbal word with two occurrences
of [6] - pinaymariman. If a table of 'affix orders' were constructed we
would have to allow the 'threading' of the table to loop back and pass
through parts of it at least twice.
All the complexities just mentioned involve the comitative/instrumentive affix -mal~-mbal. Now we showed in 5.7 that any surface
structure which involves this affix can be provided with a deep structure
involving two S's. This suggests rules for deriving verbal word structure:1. V ^ R o o t + N ^ n + N-yaray [) + (-#y) + (REFL) + (V) +1^
\ l -gamy )J
(here I indicates the final inflectional ending)
(-gali~-nbal\\
I -yaray \ I + (-fay) + (REFL) + (V)
I -ganiy ))(6. jVerbal morphology247With the proviso that only a transitive root can accept -yay, reciprocal
or reflexive affixes, and then becomes intransitive. Thus only one of
these three affixes can be chosen in rule i.
These rules explain FIRSTLY the fact that -yay and reciprocal affixes
occur immediately after a verb root; SECONDLY the fact that -yay and
reciprocal can be followed by aspectual affixes, e.g. dumbalnbangalin4aygu* nudilyand,ayman^ duyginayaraygu (text xxv, line 58, p. 392);
THIRDLY, the fact that reflexive can be preceded by aspectual affixes,
e.g. gunbalganirfariman.
Thus, following 5.7, we regard -mal~-mbal as a type of verb root,
that can 'take' any verbal affixes with the exception of -yay and
reciprocal. In practice, no form involving more than two comitative
affixes has been encountered (this implies two applications of rule 2
above); the instrumentive affix has been encountered followed by an
aspectual affix, but not by reflexive.
Each verb must take a final inflectional ending. The possibilities are:
[1] tense (3.4.3)
[a] future - DM -ji with deletion of stem-final consonant; G -d,ay
to an -/ stem, and -ndjay with deletion of stem-final -y in the
case of a -y stem
[b] non-future - -n to an -/ stem and -jiu to a -y stem, with
deletion of stem-final consonant in each case
[2] imperative (4.12)
[a] positive - deletion of stem-final consonant
[b] negative - DM -m replacing stem-final consonant; G -mu
with loss of stem-final -y but retention of -/
[3] -yura (4.5.5)
[4] purposive - -gu to a -y stem and -i to an -/ stem (4.4.3)
[5] -bila~-ba (details in 4.13.1); can in some circumstances be
followed by -gu

'2486.jVerbal morphology6.3.2 Aspectual affixes. In addition to the affixes that mark types
of construction, there are also four stem-forming ' aspectual' affixes:
[1] -nbal~-galiy 'do it quickly'. The alternants occur as follows:
[a] -nbal with transitive -/ stems;
[b] -galiy, plus elision of stem-final -y or -/, with all other
stems (i.e. with intransitive -/ stems, and with all -y stems).
Thus, with transitive roots d/urgay and buybal, and intransitive baniy
and wayjidjih
(621) yadjd bayi bargan djUrgagalijiu I quickly speared the wallaby
(622) yaq]a gijia buybalnban I hid that thing quickly
(623) bayi y ay a banigalijiu man came quickly
(624) yad,a wayjidjigalijiu I went uphill quickly
It appears that in M -galiy can be used with all stems, although -nbal is
PREFERRED with transitive -/ stems; in D, ONLY -nbal occurs with transitive-Z stems.
The basic form of alternant -nbal can be regarded as -bal, the -nbeing brought in by a phonological rule (7.5.1).
A case could be made for considering the reciprocal affix -(n)bariy as morphologically analysable into -{n)bal and reflexive -{yi)riy. Arguments against this
are [1] such an analysis would be semantically unrevealing - there being no
implication of 'quickness' in -{n)bariy\ [2] the -{n)bal alternant is only used
with -Z stems, whereas -{n)bariy can be used with any transitive root (obligatorily
reduplicated) - we thus have d,urgagalijiu' spear quickly' and (jurgaycjurgaybarijiu
' spear each other' but not *4urga(y)ban.
There are also forms that appear to be false reciprocals, exactly like false
reflexives: thus maygalmbarigu (text xxxib, line 9, p. 383) and yubalnbarimali
(text xv, line 76, p. 381). These forms involve a transitive root with the
reciprocal affix, but show no reduplication; they function intransitively. We
can either regard them as 'false reciprocals', or else as 'false reflexives' with
the reflexive affix preceded by -nbal; there is no evidence preferring either
solution. It should be noted that, even though we chose not to relate reciprocals
to reflexives (in the past paragraph) we are still free to relate ' false reciprocalsJ
to 'false reflexives'.
[2] -ganiy 'do it repeatedly'. When used with a -y stem, stem-final
-y is replaced by -n-; stem-final -/ is retained in G and M but lost in
D.
(625) balan cfugumbtl baygul yayaygu balgaganijiu man has hit woman
many times
(626) bayiya^a baninganijtu man has come here many times6.jVerbal morphology249[3] -yway, with deletion of the final -/ or -y of a stem to which it is
attached. This affix is not so easily translatable into English as -nbal~
-galiy or -ganiy. It appears to mean either * do it a bit more' or ' start
to do it' or (start to do it a bit more':
(627) bayi yaya yanuyarajm man went a bit further away
(628) balan fagumbil baygul yaiaygu balgayarapu man started to hit
woman (i.e. he raised his stick, and started to bring it down to
hit her) OR man hit woman a bit harder
(629) bayi ya^a banagayarajm EITHER man carried on returning (i.e.
he is now on the last half of his journey back) OR man returned
again (having already returned once and gone away again)
[4] -fay (when used with a -y stem, stem-final -y is replaced by -n-).
This affix appears on the surface to have two quite different semantic
effects, implying:
EITHER [a] that an action is repeated (the action often being performed
not with respect to some known goal, but blindly, everywhere, in the
hope of encountering a goal):
(630) bayi yapa yandanfajiu he called out in all directions (i.e. not
knowing if there was anyone there to hear him)
(631) bayi yaya bilinfapu he climbed many trees (e.g. looking for
possum, not knowing where any might be)
(632) yafa buialfajiu I looked everywhere
OR [b] that an action involves many objects (realising deep function
SorO):
(633) bayi yaia jtinanfajtu many men are sitting down
(634) balam miraji baygul yaiaygu gundalfajtu he put lots of beans in
[the dilly bag]
The first type of meaning of -fay appears to have some similarities
with the meaning of -ganiy.
-fay can best be explained, and contrasted with ganiy, as follows:
-ganiy indicates that an event is repeated many times OVER A LONGISH
TIME SPAN, each event being an exact repetition (same action, objects,
etc.) of the original event, -fay indicates that an event is repeated
many times WITHIN A SHORT TIME SPAN, the events being taken to be
exact repetitions if this would be situationally plausible; if it is situationally implausible for an event to be exactly repeated many times2506*3Verbal morphologywithin a short time span then the repetition is understood to involve
some difference of token (but not of type) of one aspect of the event.
Thus bilinganiy might refer to a person climbing the same tree
every morning for a week, while bilindjay would normally be taken to
refer to a person climbing many different trees within the space of an
hour, say. yabal is a transitive root ' duck [a person under the water]';
the form yabalganiy means 'repeatedly duck', while yabalcjay is
' drown', jiinay is a 'durative' verb indicating an act of sitting down or
staying put for some time (and not just the action of getting into
a sitting position, which would be pinayaray) and so pinan^ay is
normally taken to refer to a number of people all sitting down. In the
case of gundaldjdy it is implausible to suppose that one thing should be
put many times into a single container, or put into many different
containers - the unmarked interpretation of gundal^ay is of many
things being put into a single container.
The difference of token between successive events referred to by a
-d,ay form are EITHER [ I ] differences of location or direction - as in
bilintfay, r)andand,ayy bupalrfay; OR [2] different tokens of a (deep) topic
NP. -a]ay c a n n e v e r refer to different tokens of an A NP.
wugal 'give' has wide syntactic properties (see 8.2.3). That which
is given can be in instrumental case, with the recipient as O NP; or
that which is given can be head of the O NP. -d,ay will refer to whatever
is in the nominative case:
(635) bayiyaia baygul wudjUygu wugald,apu he gave the food to lots of
men
(636) bar/gul balam wuq\u wugaldjOpu he gave all the food away
See also (503-6) in 5.7.5.
Only one of the three affixes -nbal~ -galiy, yaray and ganiy can be
chosen in each of rules 1 and 2; however, any of these affixes may be
followed by -(^ay. When -yaray and -rfay occur together the meaning
of -yarandjay is ' has been doing it habitually':
(637) balan q]ugumbil baygul yayaygu yanbayaran^apu the man would
always ask the woman (i.e. ask the same thing)
(638) balan djUgumbil yanuyaranrfapu woman would go over regularly
(e.g. to see a sick relative)6.jVerbal morphology2516.3.3 The irregular verb yanu. The verb 'go* effectively has two
roots -yana{l) in positive imperative forms, and yanu{l) in all other
(including negative imperative) forms. The unmarked tense form is
yanu and not *yanun. Otherwise, yanu(l) and yana(l) behave like
-/ roots, except that root-final -/ can optionally be dropped when not
followed by a plosive (-/- is more likely in G than in D to be retained
before nasals). We thus haveyanuman~yanulman, butyanulfapu rather
than *yanu4ajiu\ and positive imperative forms yana, yanamalcja,
yanagali, etc.
In addition to yanu(l)mali, the form yanamali has been heard - see (668) - and
is confirmed by informants as a bona fide Dyirbal form, contrasting with
yanumali. This can only mean that the lower sentence in a -yum construction
(in which the higher sentence is COMIT) can be EITHER imperative OR nonimperative. This distinction is shown in the final form of the verb ONLY IN
THE CASE OF yanu\ Probably only a linguist who was a native speaker of
Dyirbal could gain any real understanding of this point.
6.3.4 Reduplication. Any verbal root can be reduplicated - this
involves the repetition of the first two syllables of the root only, in
front of the main occurrence of the root (compare with nominal reduplication where the whole root is repeated, irrespective of how many
syllables long it is): thus banipu 'come', banibanijiu; balgan 'hit'
balgabalgan; but miyandajiu 'laugh', miyamtyandapu;
banagajiu'return',
banabanagapu.
It seems that the final consonant of a two-syllable root can appear in the
reduplicated prefix only if it is preserved AS IS in the final form of the verb;
and even then its reduplication is optional. In fact the reciprocal of baran,
M, * punch* has been noted as either barabatalnbari/iu, baralbaxalnbarijiu,
baranbaralnbari/iu or bazalnbaralnbarijiu (the two intrusive n's being explained
by a phonological rule - see 7.5.1).
Semantically, reduplication indicates that an action was or is being
performed to excess: thus miyamiyandajiu 'laugh more than is appropriate', mi^umidjUn 'having to wait [for someone] longer than one
should have t o ' ; barjgabarjgan 'put too much paint on', balgabalgan
'hit too much'.
Reduplication of the root of a verbal form is optional, except in the
case of reciprocal forms when it is obligatory; verbal affixes cannot be
reduplicated.
If a nominal form acting with nominal function is reduplicated, the
whole root is repeated; but if a verbalised nominal (i.e. a form with2526.3Verbal morphologyverbal function) is reduplicated only the first two syllables are repeated.
Thus we have nominal gulgip 'prettily painted [of a man]' and
gulgipgulgip ' lots of prettily painted [men]'; and verbalised gulgipbin
'become prettily painted' and gulgigulgipbin 'become painted with
too much paint'.
6.4 Morphology of time qualifiers
Time qualifiers (3.5, 4.14) can take the following affixes:
[1] -badjiin. As with nouns (6.1.1), this affix indicates 'certainty' (that
a particular event has happened or will happen at a particular time):
(639) gilu bayiyaya banijt man will come later on today
(640) gilubadjun bayiya^a baniji man is certain to come later on today
It appears that -badjun can occur with all time words.
[2] -baia (see 6.1.1). As with nouns, -bapa has a comparative meaning;
thus d,ajid,arubaia refers to a time earlier than 4aJl4aru C3Ut s t ^l ' earlier
on today'); and giluba^a to a time later than gilu (but still 'later on
today'), -bapa can occur as an affix to words referring to past or to
future time but not to 4aP4a 'now'.
[3] ""4^u DG, '4U M (see 6.1.1). This 'emphatic' affix is attested
with all time words. It appears to have much the same effect as -bapa;
the emphasis that 4ap4aru4^u carries implies that it refers to a time
earlier than 4ap4aru> e t c [4] durational inflections: [a] -{rj)gu 'until'. This cannot occur with
past time words. The affix is -gu in some cases and -rjgu in others;
thus yulgagu 'until tomorrow', 4#dagu 'for a few days' but gilurjgu M,
gilugu D 'until later on today', -gu can also occur with 4afl4a ' n o w '
(in M at least) and adds some kind of emphasis; thus 4aJl4a bani
'come now' and d,ajid,agu bant 'you MUST come now'.
-(y)gu, but not -mu, forms can be verbalised.
In 4.14 we gave examples of locational and nominal expressions that can have
a time meaning: yarjgn{n)bay4igu t next week', and yaygungagaragabunda ' nextmonth \ These plainly involve the ergative/instrumental inflection and suggest
that' time until' -{rj)gu might be historically related to the ergative/instrumental
rather than to the dative nominal inflection.[b] -mu ' since'; this occurs only with past time words - bandagaymu
'since many years ago', rjumburjgamu 'since yesterday', {-mu is commoner in D than in M; strictly speaking, it may be confined to the
D dialect.) -mu has semantic affinity with -yunu, used in a time sense
(cf. (548) in 6.1.1):6.4 Morphology of time qualifiers253(641) ban djUgumbil yapnbinj cfamiyunu gubilamu woman is slim, but
was fat some years ago (literally: woman has become slim, from
being fat some years ago)
-mu only occurs next to the root of a time qualifier. If any other affix
intervenes, the 'from' form is -yunu-thus bandagaymu but bandagaybayayunu. This suggests that -mu should be considered an allomorphic
variant of -yunu. In some cases an affix has been observed FOLLOWING
-mw-thus yudaygamubaia balay bayi jtinapu 'he's been sitting there
quite a while!'
-mu or -yunu can often be omitted, the durational meaning still
being evident from the rest of the sentence. There are, however,
considerable complexities. Consider, in M {gala is 'earlier on today':)
(642) yaa]a yalay galabaya jiinajm I've been sitting here for hours
(643) yadja yalay jiinajiu galaba^ayunu I'm sitting here [for a rest
because, say, I've been walking] for hours
A possible explanation of the difference between (642) and (643) is
that the underlying representation of (642) involves inflection -mu,
which is deleted by a 'performance-rule'; and that -yunu in (643) is
not a 'since' inflection but the stem-forming affix -yunu, as in (548).
[5] affixes -ban and -a]ana (6.1.6) can occur with time words djajidjoban, giluban, gilurfana.
Non-time words, often with nominal inflection -gabun 'another', can
be used in a locative inflection, with time reference. Thus bala q]agun ' a
sleep', and djagungabunda 'next night', as in (text xxxib, line 19, p. 385):
(644) bayum balan yuygugan a^agungabunda yad,a yamban then I heard
another [Dambun spirit] the next night
Andgarimaia 'in the summer', garimalgabunda 'in the next summer';
birgiia ' in the wintertime', birgilgabunda; gagalumgabunda ' next month'
etc.
There is also D yalamayprfa, M yalamaypd^ay 'at the same time'
(cf. yalamay in 3.4.4, and note that the M time form involves yalamay
even though the M verb isyalabay). Thus:
(645) yalamayjid,a yalidji yubanwe both put it down at the same timeand also (for -bu 'only' see 6.7.2):
(646) yalamayjid,abu yalia]i jiinajiu yalay it's the first time we've both
sat here together (literally: 'the only same time')
Time words also take affix -bi- 6.7.3.","[269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277]"
"However, a sentence can also be transformed into a -yay form in
which dative is substituted for the nominative inflection of the NP in
O function:
(68) bayiyaja bagul bargangu d,urganajiu man is spearing wallaby
(69) bayiyaxa bagun q]ugumbilgu balgalyajiu man is hitting woman
(64), (66) and (68), and (65), (67) and (69), have the same cognitive
meanings. In (64-5) the O NP is * topic' whereas in (66-9) the A NP
is topic, giving the sentences different statuses qua discourse patterning
- see 4.5. Sentences (64-5) show the preferred, unmarked construction
(they are referred to as * simple sentences' below); -yay constructions
normally only occur non-initially in a discourse, as demanded by the
structure of the discourse - 4.5.
The difference between (66-7) and (68-9) is felt by speakers of
Dyirbal to be a crucial and important one; it cannot be brought out
through English glosses, but is explained in terms of the 'deep syntax'
of Dyirbal in 5.4. Roughly, in (66-7) the actor, goal and action make
up an event; (68-9) imply something more - that the actor is positively
implicating the goal in the event. The difference is essentially one of
topic.
Similarly, involving pronouns, we have:
(70) yad,a yinuna balgan I am hitting you
(71) yaq]a yinungu balgalyajiu I am hitting you
(70) is a simple sentence corresponding to (65). (71) corresponds to (69) - the
NP that was previously in O case is now in dative inflection, and the NP that
was previously in A case is now in S case (although the change is not observable
here, since in D the first person singular pronoun is va4a in both A and S
functions). There appears to be no pronominal sentence corresponding to
(67) - it would be mf)ad,a yinda balgalyajiu^ in terms of the rules explained in
chapter 5; such a sentence is totally unacceptable. A fuller discussion of the
behaviour of pronouns under the -yay transformation (in terms of which the
discussion of this paragraph will be more intelligible) is in 5.2, 5.8.2. This
behaviour is part of the evidence suggesting that pronouns have a nominativeergative underlying pattern.
Constructions similar to the Dyirbal -yay type have not been reported for
languages in other parts of Australia; this may, however, be a reflection of the
relatively little attention that has been paid to syntax in studies of other languages.
Of the languages surrounding Dyirbal only Wargamay appears to have a
construction of this type.",[90]
"Realisation rules (cxii) explain why there is only one type of -yay
construction involving pronouns, although there are two varieties
involving nouns (point [7] in 5.1).
In the case of nouns we have (cf. (481), (483) etc.):5.8 Actor NPs201(509) bayi ya^a baguntfugumbilgubalgalyapu man hit woman
(510) bayiyaia baygunrfugumbipubalgalyapu man hit woman

Now suppose that the O NP is ' first person singular pronoun' in
(cxiii) and (cxiv). Corresponding to (509) we get:

However, the surface structure corresponding to (510) and (cxiv)

yaXabalgalNote that the pronominal NP is marked as [ergative] and also as

to NPs with case markings [nominative] and [ergative]; it will be seen
that there is NO pronominal form corresponding to the features [ergative]
and [ — actor]. There is thus NO FORM that can be the realisation of
NP2 in (cxv), and it is almost certainly because of this that there is
NO CONSTRUCTION, involving a pronominal O NP, corresponding to
A pronominal A or S NP prefers to occur sentence initial, before even a topic
NP — see 7.8; there must thus be a phonological rule moving any NP that
has the feature [ +actor], and that involves a pronoun, to the front of any
other NP in the sentence.","[224, 225, 226]"
"5.2Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language133It was mentioned in 4.10 that a relative clause to a topic NP has verbal
inflection -yu, and a relative clause to an A NP (which is in ergative
case) has verbal inflection -yuru. Thus we have, with pronouns:
(434) yaa]a wayjidjiyu miyandapu I laughed as I went uphill
(435) yayguna wayjid,iyu baygul ya^aygu hup an man saw me going
uphill
(436) yadjd wayjifyyuru balan q]ugumbil buyan I saw woman as I was
going uphill
but not:
*(437) Va4a wayp4iyuru vniyandayiu
And
(438) yaa]a wayjiq]iyu balan d,ugumbil buyan
could only mean ' I saw woman as SHE was going uphill\
Similarly with possessive phrases - 4.11.
With interrogative pronominal NPs we have (3.3.3):
(439) wajia bayi banijiu who [ = which man] came here?
(440) ban djUgumbil wajidjU balgan who hit the woman?
(441) wajiuna bay gun djUgumbiiu balgan who did the woman hit?
Then, from (439), (441):
(442) wajia bayi banijiu baygun djiigumbiiu balgan who came here and
was hit by the woman?
From (439) and (440):
(443) wajia bayi banijiu bagun rfugumbilgu balgalyajtu
and hit the woman?who came hereFrom (441) and (439):
(444) wajiuna baygun djUgumbiiu balgan bayi banijiu who was hit by
the woman and then came here?
From (440) and (439):
(445) wajiq]u ban djUgumbil balgan bayi baniyura
and then immediately came here?who hit the woman,Note: These sentences were originally constructed without the bayi in (439),
(442-5); however, informants suggested that they would be better with a bayi1345- 2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative languagein. It appears that an interrogative form does not usually function, by itself, as
the topic for a series of sentences.
We thus have a general rule: irrespective of realisational identities
or differences, the unmarked syntactic identification between simple
sentences is always of an S NP with an O NP (or S with S, or O with O)
and NEVER of an S or O NP with an A NP. To identify an S or O NP
with an A N P - a s in (421), (429), (431), (422), (433) - particular
marked syntactic means (a favourite or a -yura construction) have to
be employed.
This rule was in fact anticipated in the summary (4.5.6) of ways of
generating a discourse from types of sentence-pairs - these ways do
NOT depend on whether the NPs involved are nominal, pronominal or
pronominal interrogative.
From our discussion above it thus appears coincidental that identical
forms mark functions S and A in the case of all pronouns in D and M,
and for non-singular pronouns in G. The case inflections of pronouns
are discussed and explained in 5.8.2.
There is one respect in which pronouns seem to have slightly wider syntactic
possibilities than nouns. We mentioned in 4.5.2 that an SA pronoun can run
through a sequence of intransitive simple sentences, and also through a sequence
of transitive simple sentences - as in (117-18). That is, we can identify an A
pronominal NP in one sentence with an A pronominal NP in the next (but, as
mentioned above, we cannot directly identify O or S with A, or vice versa).
However, we can also have a -rjay plus -yura construction joining two pronominal A NPs, as in (153), or else a 'planning ahead' construction, similar to
(160).","[156, 157, 158]"
"j.2Nominals: nouns and adjectives47The comments of the last two paragraphs suggest that the inclusion of gijiaand yala- forms in one paradigm is probably incorrect. Instead, we could
construct a full yala- paradigm, exactly like those with bala- and yala-, and
a separate short paradigm for gijia- forms, which occur in nominative case
only. We could then say that nominative yala- forms ARE NOT USED, demonstrative markers based on gijia- always being preferred. Thus:
*(8) yayi yaxa miyandajtu
is not an acceptable Dyirbal sentence; (2) is used instead. However, in some
dialects gijta- markers do not occur with certain affixes that can follow balaand yala- forms, and IN THESE CASES nominative yala- markers do occur - thus
yayijtayga ' for fear of this class I thing', in which nominative yayi is followed
by -pa- and then the locative inflection (see 6.1.5); and yalanambila 'with this
class II thing' in which nominative yalan is followed by -jia- and then the
derivational affix -bila (6.1.1). These examples support the claim that nominative
markers based on the root yala- are ' suppressed' by gijia- forms; they reappear
in contexts in which gijia forms do not appear.
ban, bam, you and yam occur as free variants of balan, balam, yalan
and yalam respectively.
This is clearly a further extension of the principle of deleting the final -la- of
bala- and yala-; note that the class IV nominative markers - bala and yala cannot be reduced. There are only six monosyllabic words in Dyirbal, the four
given here and two interjections ya 'yes' and yu 'alright' — 4.17.
A further noun marker, in D and M only, is based on the root
gila\ this occurs in nominative, ergative/instrumental, dative and simple
genitive, but has a defective paradigm - 6.5.2.
Forms balay gijia and so on occur in a number of other Australian languages;
comparative notes are included in 6.5.1, 6.5.3.
Almost all nouns have fixed class membership; the exceptions are
a handful of (kinship and human age-group) words like 4a4a 'baby',
bimu 'father's elder brother or sister' that can take class I or class II
markers depending on the sex of the referent. Nouns referring to men,
kangaroos and possums, most snakes and fishes, a few birds, most
insects, the moon, storms, boomerangs and money come under class I;
women, anything to do with fire or water, bandicoots, a few snakes
and fishes, most birds, snails, grasshoppers and crickets, the sun and
stars, and shields under class II; all wild fruit and vegetable food, and
the trees that bear them, under class III; trees (without edible fruit),
grass, sand, mud, stones, bees and honey, meat, wind, tomahawks,
noises and language under class IV. An explanation of the semantic
basis of noun class membership is in 8.4.4.","[70, 71]"
