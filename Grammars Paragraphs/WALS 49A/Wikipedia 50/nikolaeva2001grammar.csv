"4.2.2.2.1. Functions of the Accusative
The Accusative noun phrase corresponds to the object argument of the
transitive verbs with different semantic roles: patient, theme, content, goal,
stimulus, etc. (14.3, 14.4). The case is inherited by the corresponding
(non-pronominal) argument in passive constructions, as distinct from English
and many European languages, both in the Passive (16.1.1) and Agentless
Passive (16.1.2). The Accusative (or the Dative) marks the causee in the120 Noun inflectional morphology
Causative constructions (16.1.4) and the only argument of the objective
Resultative (17.2.2.5.2). It is also used to indicate the addressee of the
imperative in indirect speech constructions (18.4.4). The double object
construction is addressed in 16.2.1.
A few nouns (13.6.2) and postpositions (10.2.3) take an Accusative
argument. Adverbial elements are marked by the Accusative if they denote a
span of time (15.4.2.6).","[153, 154]"
"9.2.3. Possessive forms
Like possessive Personal pronouns, possessive reflexive pronouns are used
only in the non-attributive function, that is, mostly in the argument position
within a headless noun phrase (22.2.3) or as a final predicate. In the argument
position they take the case form of the corresponding argument, and in a
predicate function they are used in the Nominative.
Morphologically, the possessive reflexive pronouns are derived from the
stem meni-, followed by the affix of Alienable Possessive -ηί- (4.1.4.4), and
then the case affix (which is null for the Nominative and the Accusative), and
the reflexive personal inflection (-i for the Singular and -f(e)i for the Plural).
The Nominative is identical to the Accusative and includes only the stem
meni-, the affix -ηί-, and the reflexive personal inflections. The Destinative
case is lacking. The paradigms of the possessive reflexive pronouns are:NOM-ACC

Reciprocal pronouns (pro-nouns) have only the Nominative and Accusative
forms. In functions other than the direct object or the possessive modifier other
means are used to convey a reciprocal meaning (on the syntax of
reciprocalization see 22.4).
(603) NOM
ACCmen-e-men-e
mef(e)i-(-mef(e)i)'each other's'
'each other'Morphologically, the Nominative is the reduplicated form of the reflexive stem
me(n)- and the Accusative goes back to its Accusative Plural form (9.2.2).
Reciprocal pronouns must be overtly present in a sentence.
The Nominative reciprocal acts as the possessive modifier, while the
Accusative reciprocal functions as the direct object or takes other roles (for
further information see 22.4.1). Unlike the Nominative form of the Reflexive
pronoun, the Nominative Reciprocal does not occur as a subject or an object of
a postposition. It is used either as a possessive modifier (22.4.1.2) or
adverbially with the meaning 'separately, each by himself, and 'in different
directions', cf.:
(604) a.b.c.","[375, 376]"
"4.2.2. Functions of the cases
4.2.2.1. The Nominative
The Nominative forms coincide with the bare noun stem, therefore the
Nominative is not indicated in the glosses. The Nominative noun phraseFunctions of nominal inflectional categories 119
typically corresponds to the subject argument of transitive and intransitive
verbs (Chapter 14) including (the pronominal) subject of the Personal Passive,
which encodes the patient/theme argument (15.1.1.2). On the syntactic
properties of the subject see 15.1.1. The Nominative is also the case of the
subject in most (though not all) copular constructions (17.2.2) and the only
argument of the subjective and sometimes objective Resultative (17.2.2.5).
Beside this, Nominative nouns have the predicative function (17.2.2.1.3) and
may serve as the (new or non-specific) direct object (4.2.2.2).
The Nominative noun phrase functions as a modifier within a larger
possessive noun phrase (13.1); it is also used in appositions (13.8), in addresses
(12.2.1.1), and as a quotation and label form of a noun. A second or third
(essive) argument of a small number of verbs corresponds to the Nominative
noun phrase (see 14.3.9 and 14.4.8).
Most postpositions govern the Nominative case, for example: teijku wei-le-ni
'on the stool' (see more in 10.2.3). Nominative forms are used in some
""frozen"" adverbial expressions meaning duration of time or location in time:
gä.r/a ineqi-ni 'all day long', dogbo ineyi 'through night and day', and other
analogous expressions of time (15.4.2.8).","[152, 153]"

Demonstrative pronouns behave morphologically and syntactically as
pro-adjectives: they function either as an attributive modifier, or as a
nominalized element within a headless noun phrase. In a modifier function they
always precede the head noun and have the Nominative Singular form. On the
demonstrative noun phrase see 13.4. The oblique case forms do not function as
modifiers but are substantivized and take argument and adverbial roles. The
local cases are used as independent local pro-adverbs, which is the only way to
form deictic and anaphoric pro-adverbs in Udihe.
Semantically, demonstratives are divided into two major classes, the
anaphoric-deictic class and the deictic class. Deictic pronouns cannot function
as textual anaphors, while anaphoric-deictic pronouns are used both in deictic
and anaphoric roles. In the latter case they have either resumptive or
discourse-linking function. In this section we only cite examples for their
deictic use, while section 22.1.2 presents instances of anaphora. For both major
classes two series are distinguished in terms of the distance from the point of
reference: proximal deixis pronouns and distal deixis pronouns. So, Udihe
demonstratives fall into four series.
Demonstrative pronouns exhibit case inflection similar to, though still
somewhat different from, the inflection of nouns. The formal difference is
attested in the Lati ve case, in which the pronouns have two forms: with the
regular inflection -tigi or the adverbial Lative inflection -uxi, which is also used
in adverbial expressions (Chapter 11). As distinct from nouns, demonstratives
lack the Destinative and the Partitive case. The paradigms for the
demonstrative pronouns are presented below:

Plural forms are attested only for the Nominative and the Accusative. The
anaphoric-deictic pronouns can take personal inflections, for example: ei
getu-we-fi 'these of ours (ACC).'","[377, 378]"
"354 Pronouns
9.6.1. Specific Indefinite pronouns
Specific Indefinite pronouns are used if the referent of the pronoun is not
known to the speaker and cannot be identified by him/her, or when the speaker
does know the referent but prefers not to reveal it to the listener. Normally they
correspond to the English Indefinite pronouns of the series some-, and to the
Russian pronouns of the series -to.
Specific Indefinite pronouns are derived from practically all Interrogative
pronouns (pro-nouns, pro-adjectives, and pro-adverbs) by means of the
indefinite clitic particle -kA or -kAi (these forms are free variants), e.g.: j'eu-ke
'something', 'some', ni-ke 'somebody', adi-ke 'some quantity', imi-ke 'for
some reason', etc. On the use of the particle -kA as a focus clitic see
12.1.1.11.1. The indefinite particle occurs before the Accusative case
inflection: j'eu-kei-we 'something (ACC)'. In the other cases it is located in the
word after the case inflection, for example: j'e-du-ke (DAT), ni-zi-ke (INST),
j'eu-xi-ke (LAT), ni-du-ke (DAT).
The following examples illustrate the use of indefinite specific pronouns
inflected for the Instrumental (633a) and (633b), the Lative (633c), (633d), and
the Ablative (633e).

"Chapter 13
Noun phraseA noun phrase consists of a head and an optional modifier. The following
grammatical classes function as nominal heads: nouns and pro-nouns (personal
pronouns, possessive pronouns, and indefinite pronouns, see Chapter 9). In
headless noun phrases the head noun is omitted, while cardinal numerals,
quantifiers, adjectives, pro-adjectives, and the relative clause undergo
nominalization. These cases are not treated in this chapter (on the headless
relative clause see section 19.5, and on the headless noun phrase see 22.2.3).
Pro-nouns do not take a modifier, with the exception of the relative clause.
Ordinary nouns may function as attributive forms only when there is a
possessive relation between them and the head. Some exceptions are addressed
in 13.7.
The following classes of modifiers are available: pro-nouns (that is, Personal
pronouns), adjectives, pro-adjectives (Demonstrative and indefinite Pronouns),
quantifiers, postpositional phrases, oblique-case noun phrases, and the relative
clause. The relative clause is discussed in Chapter 19. Articles are missing, and
definiteness may be expressed by means of 3rd person possessive affixes
(4.3.1.1). Head nomináis cannot be modified by a simple adverbial. Adjectival
modification may also be performed by the derivational affixes -ziga (5.1.1.1)
and -ηΑ: (5.1.1.5).
The noun phrase is typically head-final. However, under certain information
structure driven conditions the order within particular noun phrases is reversed:
the modifier occupies the phrase-final position and is characterized by certain
other head properties. This process will be referred to as ""modifier raising"" and
is addressed in 24.2.1.1. As shown there, modifier raising is observed in the
situation when the modifier and the head noun bear different information
structure statuses. In this chapter we will only focus on noun phrases that are
""neutral"" (not partitioned) from the point of view of information structure, and
that correspondingly do not demonstrate modifier raising. Yet, even in this
case, head-finality is not rigid. Certain classes of modifiers - the postpositional
phrase, the oblique-case noun phrase, and certain appositions - are always
postnominal, independent of any information structure considerations, so
head-finality is violated. Other modifiers (numerals and some other quantifiers)
may be prenominai and postnominal without being raised. The word order
within noun phrases with each individual modifier is discussed in the480Noun phrasecorresponding sections, while section 13.10 focuses on word order within a
noun phrase with several modifiers.
The syntactic relationship between the head and the modifier is encoded
morphologically only in certain types of noun phrase: the possessive noun
phrase (13.1) and the phrase where the modifier corresponds to the indefinite
pronoun (9.6). Otherwise the modifier is merely juxtaposed to the head noun.
The only lexical material that may be inserted between the head and the
modifier are focus particles, cf.:
(925) Sita-i
tene
bugdi-le-ni
child-REF
CONT leg-LOC-3SG
'He strung his child's legs.'su:ne:-k.
string.PAST-EXPROn discontinuous noun phrases see 24.2.1.2.
Attributive agreement in case is absent with the notable exception of some
quantifiers (13.3.4), some types of appositions (13.8.2), and relative clauses
(see Chapter 19). Attributive agreement in number is obligatory only when the
head nominal is morphologically marked for plurality (13.2.2). In the ""neutral""
noun phrase discussed here the external syntactic role of the noun phrase is
encoded by (case) markers on the head noun, for other cases see 24.2.1.1.
Below the noun phrases are presented according to the modifier types. For
apposition see 13.9.
For the adjective phrase see 6.3, for the adverbial phrase see 10.1.7, and for
the postpositional phrase see 10.2.3.","[511, 512, 513, 514]"
"6.1.2.2. Case
As argued in 13.2, under neutral communicative conditions an adjective in the
attributive function does not inflect for case, so case agreement between the
modifier and the head noun is absent (exceptions are certain quantificational
adjectives, see 13.3.4). Adjectives take case affixes only when they belong to
one of the following syntactic types:
(i) a substantivized adjective within a headless noun phrase (22.2.3);
(ii) a discontinuous attributive modifier (24.2.1.2);
(iii) a raised attributive modifier (24.2.1.1);
(iv) an independent copredicative adjective (19.6);
(v) adjectives in the Dative (14.4.1.2) and Instrumental (14.3.4.1) that take
an argument position;
(vi) adjectives in the Dative that function as temporal adjuncts (15.4.2.1);
(vii) adjectives in the Accusative in a copular complement clause with an
omitted copula (20.2.2.4).
Examples are presented in the corresponding sections.
The functions of the cases and case morphemes are the same for adjectives
as for nouns (4.2.2). Most adjectives follow the type I declension, and only a
few quantificational adjectives (see 6.1.1) belong to type Π.",[209]
"9.1.1.3. Possessive form
The possessive forms of the Personal pronouns are: 1SG mini-rji 'mine', 2SG
sini-ηϊ 'yours', 3SG nua-ηί, ηιια-ψ-ni 'his, hers', 1PL IN minti-ψ 'ours', 1 PL
EX muñu-iju 'ours', 2PL suñu-rju 'yours', 3PL nuati-rji 'theirs'. As can easily
be seen, these forms are actually oblique pronominal stems, sometimes slightly
modified phonologically, augmented by the suffix of Alienable Possessive -ηί(4.1.4.3).
Possessive Personal pronouns are not used attributively, but only occur in the
case position (argument or adjunct) within the headless noun phrase (22.2.3), or
as predicative elements in the copular construction (17.2.2.3). They inflect for
case in the same way as nouns, and their case forms have the same meanings as
the corresponding case forms of nouns (4.2.2). Used as predicative elements in
a copular construction, the possessive Personal pronouns are always in the
Nominative.",[370]

Introduction1.1. The Udihe language and its genetic affiliation
Udihe (other spellings used are Udehe, Udegej, Udege, Udeghe, Udige,
Udighe, LJde) is a Tungus language spoken as a first language by
approximately 100 people, all over 50 years old, in the southern part of the
Russian Far East (see 1.2.3 for more information on the number of speakers
and 1.2.4 on its geographical location). Udihe is divided into two dialects each
with several local variants (1.3). Despite a lack of official status or written
tradition, several attempts have been made to create a writing system for use in
schools (1.6.2, 1.6.3).
The Tungus (Tungus-Manchu) language family is widely assumed to be a
branch of Altaic. The scheme in (1) represents the classification of the Tungus
languages as accepted in Vasilevic (1960) and Sunik (1962: 16-20, 1968: 54,
1997: 154). The alternative classifications either group together the Manchu
and Southern Tungus languages (Cincius 1949; Benzing 1955: 9-10; Menges
1978: 370; Comrie 1981: 58) or treat Northern Tungus, Southern Tungus, and
Manchu as three independent branches (Avrorin 1959-1961). On some other
classifications and/or comparisons between them see Menges (1968: 25-30),
Ikegami (1974), Doerfer (1978), Vovin (1993), and Miller (1994).

the Udihe were thought to be part of the Oroch people, and were referred to as
Orochs or Orochons (1.7.1). However, closer examination of the linguistic and
anthropological data, as well as the oral tradition (see, for example, the
collection of Oroch folklore in Avrorin and Lebedeva (1978)), suggests that
they are in fact two different ethnic groups. On the phonetic and morphological
correspondences between the Oroch and Udihe languages see Cincius (1949)
and Kormusin (1998: 4-6).","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
"PrefaceThis book is the first substantial reference grammar of Udihe (Udehe, Udeghe),
a little studied language of the Tungus branch of Altaic. At present Udihe is
spoken as a first language by about 100 people in the Russian Far East. The
language lacks a standardized writing system, and is only occasionally taught
in schools. This grammar describes the so-called Southern dialect of Udihe,
spoken on the banks of the Bikin and Iman rivers. The Northern dialect, spoken
on the banks of the Khor, Anyui and Samarga rivers, differs only slightly.
Most of the examples cited in the current study are the result of fieldwork
conducted between 1989 and 1997 in the settlement of Krasnyi Yar on the river
Bikin. They are largely excerpts from original Udihe texts. Others are
sentences produced by native speakers either spontaneously or in response to
questions posed in Russian by the linguist conducting the interview. Although
the latter examples may not be spontaneous, we believe they nevertheless
encapsulate an essential linguistic competence.
Although this study is not meant as a comparative grammar of the two Udihe
dialects, we have also taken a few examples from the Northern dialect. They
are used, firstly, to illustrate slight dialectal divergences, and secondly - if the
dialects do not differ on the point in question - to provide particularly
illustrative examples. Examples in the Northern dialect Eire taken from
published materials, in which case the appropriate reference is provided. We
have used the following abbreviations to cite some of the sources of the
sentence examples, followed by the relevant page numbers.
Κ
= Kormusin (1998)
SK
= Simonov and Kjalundzjuga (1998)
SKX = Simonov, Kjalundzjuga, and Xasanova (1998-1999)
The materials of the Northern dialect are cited using a phonological
transcription. This differs from the transcription originally used in the sources,
which was partly phonetic and in most cases employed the Cyrillic alphabet.
Sentence examples are provided in phonological transcription with morphemeby-morpheme glosses and functionally equivalent English translations. Words in
the translations that are absent in the example are bracketed, except for personal
pronouns. For the sake of economy, the personal pronouns, which are not marked
for gender in Udihe, are all translated as 'he'. In the glosses the 1st person personal
pronoun is indicated as 'me'. Russian proper names, and other terms that remain
untranslated, are cited in the international transliteration system, while localvili Preface
names are transliterated into English as they are found in English-language
geographical reference books. For polysemantic Udihe words the glosses give the
meaning appropriate to the given context, so the same word may be glossed in
several ways. For example, the Udihe word egdi may be glossed either as 'many'
or as 'much', and the postposition edeisini may be glossed either as 'if or 'when',
depending on the context.
Morphemes are separated with hyphens in both the Udihe text and the glosses.
Stems are glossed by English lexical words, while other morphemes are glossed
with abbreviations of category labels. When more than one English word is
required to translate a Udihe word, they are linked by a period. The grammatical
category that is not expressed by means of a separate morpheme is not reflected in
the glosses, partly for reasons of economy, and partly because the decision on the
presence or absence of the morphological null may sometimes be controversial.
However, when two separate morphs are contracted to one for phonological
reasons, this is indicated by a period in the glosses. Thus in the following
examples convention (a) will be used instead of (b), or (c).
(a)(b)
(c)Sagdä-rji-mi

Sagdä-iji-mi
mo:-0
bede
ute-ne:-mi.
old-V-INF
tree-NOM:SG like
rotten.tree-V:PAST-lSGThe period is also used for those few ""portmanteau"" morphs that do not result
from phonological contraction at the synchronic level, for example, -li
<CC.SS> (Conditional converb, same-subject), and -lie <CC.SS.PL>
(Conditional Converb, same-subject, Plural).
Examples that only make up a fragment of a sentence are glossed in arrow
brackets. In the translations of some examples we have included a grammatical
specification of the meaning in round brackets. This is not intended as a gloss,
but rather to facilitate understanding of the translation, for example:
zugdi-tigi'to the house (LAT)' or <house-LAT>Unlike nominal stems, bare verbal stems are cited with a hyphen, for example
zìi:- 'saw' (a verb) versus zü: 'saw' (a noun). Embedded clauses are indicated
by square brackets.
The grammar is intended to be a more or less comprehensive description. It
follows the traditional structure: general introduction - phonology morphology - syntax - texts - vocabulary - indexes. Much use is made of
cross-references between the various chapters and sections. The morphological
description is organized around inflectional and derivational forms. ThePrefaceixfunctions of some of these may be addressed in separate sections within the
corresponding chapters. The syntactic part is mostly organized around various
syntactic units such as, for example, the noun phrase, relative clause, adverbial
clause and so on, but in some cases we also follow the function-to-form
approach.
The grammar is not biased towards any particular theoretical framework,
although in several cases we choose to explain within the text the basis of the
notions used in the description. The terminology is intended to be theoryindependent. The names of particular grammatical categories typical of Udihe
are capitalized; adjectives derived from these, as well as general grammatical
and semantic notions, are in lower case, for example, ""Possessive suffix"" (the
suffix of the grammatical category Possessive) and ""possessive construction"",
""possessive form"", and ""possessive meaning"".","[6, 7, 8, 9]"
"9.5.1. Interrogative pro-nouns
Two basic forms of Interrogative pronouns are j'eu 'what' for an inanimate
antecedent, and sometimes for an animate antecedent as well, and ni 'who',
which is only used for an animate antecedent. The pronoun ni 'who' takes case
forms completely identical to those of the almost homonymie noun ni: 'man'
on which it is based. These forms are the regular case forms for class I nouns
(see 4.1.3). Most case forms of the stem j'e- are derived as regular class I
nouns, with the exception of the Lative case which takes the adverbial
inflection -uxi, the adverbial Ablative in -zetjezi, and the adverbial Accusative
in '-/<?. The case forms are:

you', j'e-ne-ni 'what for him' etc. There is also the locational noun j'e-ze 'what
side', where -ze is a derivational suffix (5.1.2.4). Thus, the case paradigm of
the pronoun j'eu exhibits formal similarities with the adverbial case paradigmsInterrogative pronouns 349
(10.1). Other forms derived from the interrogative stem is the adjective ja-ma
'what sort of (-ma is an adjectival derivational affix, see 6.4.1.2.1), and the
noun j'eu-ze 'which side' (-ze is an nominal derivational affix, see 5.1.2.4).
In quick speech the /¿-initial forms are often pronounced with an initial jior simply as i:- (2.1.4.3). For example, the Dative form may be pronounced
either as j'e-du, or as i:-du, and the Locative form can be j'e-le or i:-le, etc.","[382, 383]"
"Nominal inflection 101
4.1.1.2.2. Some historical considerations
At first sight, the reason for such a distribution seems to be purely
historical-phonological. The oblique «-final stem is a common Tungus feature.
It appears that in Udihe (and other Southern Tungus languages) the stem-final
Ini is preserved before the dentals, since all case inflections except the
Accusative begin with a dental consonant (see 6.1.3). However, it is lost
word-finally (in the Nominative) and before the labial Iwl (in the Accusative) in
full accordance with the phonotactic rules of Udihe (Chapter 3). So if we take
into account only case paradigms, the distribution n/0 appears in the modern
language to be based on phonological grounds.
However, several considerations arise at this point. TV-final stems are typical
not only of nouns, but also of other grammatical classes: verbs (7.1), some
pronouns (9.1, 9.2), postpositions (10.2), numerals (11.1), and adjectives
(6.1.1). For some of these categories the stem-final Ini behaves in a slightly
different way. Firstly, verbs show a distribution into two morphonological
classes: vowel-final stems (class I) and n-final stems (class Π). The class Π
verbs lose the stem-final Ini only before the old Past and Perfect markers -*JVand -*kV- respectively. However, in all other cases Ini is preserved, including
the occasions when it is followed by a non-dental consonant. The epenthetic
vowel -A- is then inserted to prevent an impossible consonant cluster, for
example: dian- + -mi -» dian-a-mi Ί say' <say-0-lSG> (see 7.1 for details).
Thus, in the same environment, in verbs epenthesis applies to prevent an
illegitimate cluster and not the deletion of the stem-final consonant Ini, as in
nouns. The same is true for personal pronouns (9.1.1), which exhibit an
epenthetic vowel after the n-final stem and before the Accusative suffix -wA,
for example, min-e-we 'me' <me-0-ACC>, although in this case an historical
explanation may be possible (see 3.4.1.1.1).
For some groups of words Ini is also preserved in the potential word-final
position, and followed by an epenthetic vowel -A-, cf. the Nominative form of
the Reflexive pronoun men-e (9.2), and the bare stems of the class Π verbs that
follow the negative auxiliary (7.1), such as dian-a. According to this,
epenthesis is a more regular way to prevent consonant-final forms than the
deletion of the consonant.
Finally, the stem-final Ini is not present before the nominal Plural suffix
-zigA, although it also begins with a dental, and the cluster nz is perfectly
legitimate in Udihe (Chapter 3), cf.: xoto-ziga 'towns' instead of the expected
*xoton-ziga.
These pieces of evidence weaken the idea that the absence of the stem-final
Ini in the Nominative and the Accusative of nouns is conditioned simply by
phonological considerations. Note also that the n-final stems are typical of
certain morphological groups, for example, Past active participles that decline
in the same way as class Π nouns (7.5.1.1.2). These participles historically
ended in *xcan (Benzing 1956). Most personal pronouns (9.1) and Cardinal102 Noun inflectional morphology
numerals (11.1.1) have n-final stems. This suggests that the distribution
between class I and class Π words may not have been entirely random.","[134, 135, 136]"
"Non-finite forms231Personal forms take personal suffixes that differ from the suffixes used for
Present Participles, namely they attach type V inflections: wakca:-mi 'who was
hunting (1SG)' <hunt.PP-lSG>, wakca:-mu 'who were hunting (1PL)'
<hunt.PRP-lPL.EX>. The same-subject inflections also differ: in the Singular
-mi is used instead of -i, for example: wakca:-mi 'who was hunting (SS SG)'
<hunt.PP-SS>. The Plural same-subject inflection is -fi: wakca:-fi 'who were
hunting (SS PL)' <hunt.PP-SS.PL>.
Negative Past active participles in the personal forms are as follows: e-si-ni
<NEG-PP-3SG>, e-si-fi <NEG-PP-1PL.IN>, etc. The auxiliary verb 'be' has
the form bi-si-, which inflects for person and number.
When personal forms inflect for case, the case marker follows the Past stems
and the personal inflection follows the case marker. When inflected for case,
Past active participles behave as nouns of the morphonological class Π: in all
cases except for the Nominative and Accusative the consonant Ini precedes the
case inflection (see Chapter 4 on nominal inflection). This suggests that, like
class Π nouns, Past active participles have an n-final stem, but Ini does not
surface in the Nominative and Accusative. In participles derived from class I
verbs there is no vowel lengthening, characteristic of the Past stem, before the
surface
Ini,
for
example:
wakcan-zi-ni
'who
was
hunting'
<hunt.PP-INST-3SG>. The participles derived from κ-final and /-final verbs do
not exhibit any vowel changes in cases other than the Nominative and
Accusative, for example:
(373) Lalin-zi
bude:-ni.
starve.PP-INST die.PAST-3SG
'He died from hunger.'
Class Π verbs which form the Past stem with the element -ki- have in case
forms the stem-final Ini which follows -ki-, for example: diaij-kin-zi: 'who
said' <say-PP-INST.SS>. The negative verb also has an η-stem, for example:
e-sin-zi-ni <NEG.PP-INST-3SG>.
The case paradigms are presented in 7.7. For Past Participles the Accusative
suffix is -mA- (it is identical to the class Π noun Accusative, see 4.1.1.2.1).
Like other same-subject participles and reflexive noun phrases, same-subject
Past Participles have homonymous Accusative and Nominative forms (cf.
22.3.2). The Dative inflection is either -di- or -du- depending on the same
conditions as apply to the Present active participles (7.6.1.1.1). In the Locative
and Prolative, the Past active participles take the class Π declension suffixes
-dile- and -dili-, respectively (rather than class I declension suffixes -le- and
-li-).","[264, 265]"
"10.2.1. Changeable postpositions
10.2.1.1. Derivation
Changeable postpositions go back to the possessive case forms of nouns.
Typically they are derived from the same spatial stems that are employed in the
adverbial derivation (10.1.1). Although for most postpositions the
corresponding noun is not attested in the modern language, in certain cases the
derivational relationship is still preserved. So some postpositions and base
nouns coexist, but demonstrate different categorial properties. In particular,
spatial nouns may take cases not typical of postpositions (the Accusative in
-wA/-mA, the Nominative, and the Destinative) and may be modified like other
nouns, which is absolutely impossible in the case of postpositions. As distinct
from nominal stems, the changeable postpositions never occur without
possessive inflections and case markers. Finally, nouns and the corresponding
postpositions may differ slightly in meaning, the meaning of the postposition
being more abstract, cf. examples (a) and (b) below.

Thus, the Accusative marker can be absent for semantic and phonetic reasons.
According to the semantic tendency, more fully manifested in the Northern
dialect, the Accusative case marking is likely to be absent in the direct object
noun phrase if it is: (i) non-specific (including generic and mass nouns); (ii) a
specific count noun not mentioned previously in the text, and therefore
indefinite. In all these cases, however, the morphologically marked Accusative
is not ruled out either, for example (160a) shows a non-specific noun phrase in
an object role which is inflected for the Accusative suffix -wA. Alternatively,
specific and previously mentioned (definite) noun phrases may sometimes haveFunctions of nominal inflectional categories 123

phonologically, as in (160b).

Non-Nominative forms express various ννΛ-questions in argument and
adverbial positions (23.1.1). In the subject function the pronoun j'eu 'what' in
the Nominative triggers Singular agreement on the verb, while the pronoun ni
'who' may trigger both Singular and Plural agreement. Apart from its regular
meaning ('to what'), the Dative form j'e-du/i:-du can mean 'why, what for'.
The pronoun j'eu 'what' in the Nominative also means 'why' or 'what for' (as
in Russian where cto 'what' can mean 'why, what for' in a colloquial speech),

discussed in 4.1.3.3, the 3rd person personal affix -ni can encode (situational)
definiteness. In this case the position of the possessor remains unfilled; for
example, (929) refers to sleeves of a dress, which in this case are definite.
(928) a.b.c.","[514, 515]"
"7.6.1.1.1. Present active participles
Present active participles are derived from the Present stem with the suffix -i.
For class Π verbs this suffix follows the epenthetic vowel -A-. For class I i-final
stems the participle suffix -i- is contracted with the stem final vowel into -/:.
Impersonal Singular forms coincide with the bare participle form: wakca-i
'hunting' <hunt-PRP>, dian-a-i 'saying' <say-0-PRP>. In the Plural the
impersonal forms take the Plural word getu, or - more rarely - -du-: wakca-i
getu 'hunting (PL)' <hunt-PRP PL>, dian-a-i-getu
'saying (PL)'
<say-0-PRP-PL>. The negative auxiliary impersonal form is ei. An example of
the participle in the negative form is: ei jexe 'not singing (SG)', ei jexe getu
'not singing (PL)' <NEG.PRP sing PL>, ei noni getu 'not being able (PL)'
<NEG.PRP can-PL>, ei soijo-du 'not crying (PL)' <NEG.PRP cry-PL>.
For personal forms different-subject affixes coincide with regular possessive
suffixes (or type IV inflectional affixes, see 7.2), for example: wakca-i-ni
'hunting
(3SG)'
<hunt-PRP-3SG>,
wakca-i-ti
'hunting
(3PL)'
<hunt-PRP-3PL>, etc. In the Nominative for the Is1 and 2nd persons the
personal affix is contracted with the Participle marker: i [unstressed] + i —> i,
for example: wakca-i 'hunting (1SG, 2SG)' (< wakca-i-i <hunt-PRP-lSG,
2SG>). In the 2nd Plural and 1st Plural Exclusive the participle suffix -i- is
missing, probably for the same phonetic reasons (i + u —» u): wakca-u 'hunting
(2PL, 1PL EX)' (< wakca-i-u <hunt-PRP-2PL, 1PL.EX>). In the function of
the same-subject affixes, the reflexive possessive affixes are used: -i (truncated
in the Nominative) for the Singular and -fi for the Plural. Examples: wakca-i
'hunting' <hunt-PRP.SS>, wakca-i-fi 'hunting' <hunt-PRP-SS.PL>.
Personal forms always inflect for case. The case suffix follows the participle
affix -i- and precedes the personal affix. Case affixes are the same as for the
class I nouns (see 4.1.3) except that in the Dative case two suffixes are found,
-di- and -du-. In fact, -di is an assimilated variant of -du. It appears when the
personal inflection that follows it contains the vowel Iii (cf. 2.1.4.2). Thus, the
affix -di is found in all personal forms except for the 1st person Plural Exclusive
and 2nd person Plural, which contain the vowel lui and therefore do not
assimilate the Dative suffix. The regular morphonological contraction takes
place in the course of case inflection on the boundary of the case morpheme
and the personal inflection (2.3.1), for example: wakca-i-digi <— wakca-i-digi-i230Verbal morphology<hunt-PRP-ABL-lSG> Ί am hunting (ABL)'. For the same-subject participles
the Accusative forms are homonymous with the Nominative forms. The
illustrative case paradigms are presented in 7.7.
In negative personal forms personal inflections attach to the Present
Participle of the negative verb: e-i-mi 1SG, etc. However, the behavior of the
negative forms with respect to the case affix is flexible in the sense that in the
syntactic positions that normally require case marking for the participle, the
negative verb often does not take the case marker. The case marker then
remains on the verbal stem. Compare, for example, (372a) where the negative
auxiliary has the case suffix (Accusative) marking the semantic role of the
relativized noun, and (372b) where the case suffix (Instrumental) is added to
the verbal stem and not to the auxiliary.

The pronouns nua-ni and bue-ni are morphologically complex and include

completely identical to the regular declension of class I nouns (4.1.3). Although
the pronoun bue-ti, historically includes the 3rd person Plural inflection -ti, it
does not insert case markers between it and the stem; the case markers rather
follow the -ti. The pronoun bue-ni is declined in the same way as nua-ni, the
pronoun si is declined in the same way as bi, and the pronoun su is declined in
the same way as bu. Therefore these pronouns are not presented in the
paradigms either. The pronoun nua-ti 'they' typically behaves like
morphologically simplex; so its Accusative form is nuati-we. However, it may
sometimes decline like nua-ni, in which case the case affix is inserted before
the 3rd Plural marker -ti, so the Accusative nua-ma-ti is also acceptable.
Two Personal pronouns have a suppletive n-final oblique stem. For the
pronoun bi Τ all non-Nominative cases are formed from the oblique stem
min-, while for the pronoun bu 'we (without you)' the oblique stem is mun-. In
the pronunciation of certain speakers the oblique forms of the pronoun bi 'me'
are ¿-initial under the analogous influence of the Nominative: bin-e-we
<me-0-ACC>, bin-dule <me-LOC>, etc. The pronouns si 'you (SG)' and suPersonal pronouns 335
'you (PL)' have non-suppletive oblique n-final stems, sin- and sunrespectively. All these oblique stems (min-, mun-, sin-, sun-) behave as class Π
n-final nouns (6.1.1) and take the same case inflections as class Π nouns. In the
Accusative the epenthetic lei is inserted between the stem and the case
inflections. In the other cases the epenthetic vowel is not present.
For the morphologically complex pronouns nua-ni, bue-ni the 3rd person
inflection -ni follows the case marker. Occasionally, however, a form such as
bue-ni-we <he-3SG-ACC> may also occur. The 3rd person inflection may
sometimes be absent, but this is rather infrequent: nuan-tigi (LAT) (SK 622),
nuan-digi (ABL). The stem itself is also n-final (nuan- and buencorrespondingly) and behaves like regular class Π stems: in the Accusative the
stem-final Ini is not present and the Accusative inflection is -me-, in other cases
Ini is overtly present before the case marker.
Personal pronouns lack the Destinative case for obvious semantic and formal
reasons: the Destinative is necessarily accompanied by a possessive marker
which refers to the potential recipient of the Destinative object (4.2.2.9), such a
marker cannot attach to the pronoun, which bears a personal reference by itself.
Quite predictably, the Partitive is also lacking; the corresponding meaning is
expressed with the postposition gäundi-ni (see 10.2.1.3.2).
In the Northern dialect as recorded by Kormusin (1998) the frequent absence
of the Accusative marker is attested for nouns (4.2.2.2). In the same way, the
Accusative suffix -we on the pronouns bi 'me' and si 'you' may be omitted.
The corresponding forms represent the oblique stem augmented by the
epenthetic lei: min-e 'me (ACC)' and sin-e 'you (ACC)', cf.:

"106 Noun inflectional morphology
4.1.3. Case
The Udihe case system includes ten cases. A case inflection follows the Plural
suffix and precedes the Possessive. In non-possessive forms the case suffix is
the rightmost morpheme within the word. Some morphophonemic peculiarities
observed in the declension of possessive forms are addressed in 4.1.4.1.2. Case
inflection is fairly regular for all nouns, the only differences existing are those
between the class I and class Π declensions (4.1.1). The Nominative is
zero-marked morphologically and coincides with the bare stem for class I
nouns. For class Π nouns the Nominative form is vowel-final, that is, the
stem-final Ini does not appear. Likewise, in the Accusative and the Destinative
class Π nouns do not have the stem-final Ini, while in all other cases the class Π
stem appears in its full «-final form (see 4.1.1 for further discussion and
examples). The case suffixes for the non-possessive forms are presented below:

coincides with the Nominative (4.2.2.2.2-4.2.2.2.5). The Locative and
Prolative affixes for the class Π nouns have two variants each, one with the
high round vowel lui and the other with the high vowel Iii. Their distribution is
conditioned by the tendency to assimilate the vowel Iii of the suffix to the Iii
vowel of the stem. Thus the variants -dile and -dili are normally used if the last
vowel in the stem is Iii (for example, amin-dili 'by the father' (LOC)), while
the variants -dule and -duli are used in all other cases (for example, xa-dule 'by
the brother' (LOC), namun-dule 'in the sea' (LOC), xoton-dule 'in the town'
(LOC), etc.). This tendency, however, is not absolute in both directions. The
Destinative case has a limited distribution: it must be followed by Possessive
affixes and cannot co-occur with a Plural marker. For more on the form and the
meaning of the individual cases, see 4.2.2.","[139, 140]"

"4.2.2.9. The Destinative
The Destinative case marked with the suffix -nA- has a rather limited use.
Generally speaking, it denotes either an object meant, designed, or destined for
a particular person or another object, or a destination itself. In the first
meaning, the destinative object noun phrase functions as a verbal argument
(16.2.2). This has the following two consequences: first, the destinative object
co-occurs only with a special class of verbs, namely, verbs of appearance and
creation (see 14.2.1.3); second, its form should contain a reference to its
potential 'recipient' (benefactive or goal). Indeed, as mentioned in 4.1.3, only
possessive nouns take the Destinative case; so the Destinative form must
necessarily contain a Possessive affix that agrees in person and number with
the potential possessor (benefactive) of the destinative object.
In its second meaning, the destinative noun phrase functions as a clausal
adjunct (15.4.4.3). In this case it expresses the destination of the object

copular constructions (17.2.2.2.1) the destinative noun phrase denotes not the
object designated for a particular purpose, but the destination ('as something
for somebody'). The benefactive participant is cross-referenced by the
possessive affix on the destinative noun. Note that the Singular Reflexive
Possessive affixes on the destinative noun do not in this case have a reflexive
meaning, but are used to express general destination: kusige-ne-mi 'as a knife,
for the knife' <knife-DEST-REF>.","[160, 161]"
"17.2.2.3. Alienable possessive construction
One of several options used to express a possessive relationship is the copular
construction in which the predicative word corresponds to the nominal (a noun
or a personal pronoun) with the alienable possession suffix -ψ- (see 4.1.4.4 and
9.1.1.3). The predicative word with the suffix -ψ- denotes the possessor, and
this is the only case in Udihe in which the possessor is morphologically
marked. However, in this case we are dealing not with the possessive noun
phrase but with the predicative relationship. The suffix -ηϊ- here signifies that
the possessive relationship is the main predication in the sentence. For obvious
semantic reasons, only the alienable possessive relationship can be predicated
by the construction in question. It does not allow a subject in the I s ' or 2nd
person, or the Imperative and other non-Indicative moods. Tense forms other
than the Present are also hardly found, and accordingly the personal 3rd person
Present tense copula bi:-ni is normally omitted.
The possessed noun does not form a constituent with the possessor-noun. It
need not be overtly present within the clause, as in (1285), or it may function as
the subject, as in (1286).
(1285) a.b.c.",[670]
"16.1.1.1. Passive constructions with the Nominative subject
The pronominal patient corresponds to the Nominative subject, that is, to the
nominatively marked noun phrase which is characterized by a certain cluster of
grammatical properties (15.1.1). The Nominative subject may be encoded by
the overt personal pronouns of the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person (1139), but is even
more likely to be coreferentially deleted (1140). In both cases it triggers subject
agreement on the passive verb.
(1139) a.b.",[608]
"4.2.4.3.1. Inanimate nouns
The suffix -rji- encodes an associative relation through a different kind of action,
cf.: I:bene la:-ni 'a Japanese candle' and I:bene la:-yi-ni 'the candle given by a
Japanese'. In the former case, we deal with relational possessive constructions
such as those addressed in 4.2.3.2, and the 'possessor' I:bene 'Japanese' here
simply replaces a relational adjective. In the latter case the suffix -///'- indicates138 Noun inflectional morphology
the situational relationship between the head noun la: 'candle' and the element
I:bene 'Japanese', both of which could participate in a hypothetical implied
predication 'a Japanese gave a candle'.
This type of possessive construction is known in other languages (cf. the
English John's book, which can not only mean possession, but also ""the book
which John reads, edits, sells, etc.""), but is very regular in Udihe. In this case a
situational non-possessive relation is presupposed between the 'possessor' and the
head noun. The relationship can be established between virtually any two entities
associated in the discourse. The exact form of this relation is not expressed
overtly, and therefore the construction itself is semantically undetermined. For
example, bi abuga-i Μηα-ηί-ηί 'my father's deer' <me father-lSG deer-AL-3SG>
does not necessarily mean ownership, but may refer to 'the deer my father
followed, about which he was talking, etc.'. As noticed by Taylor (Taylor 1989),
the meaning of relation in this sort of construction can only be characterized in the
context of a person's encyclopedic knowledge of the relevant words (that is,
concerning typical actions involving the entity in question). It may also be added
that, at least in Udihe, the meaning of the construction is normally deduced from
the discourse; the context and the con-situation play an important role here, since
they usually set the type of relation unambiguously. Referential conflict does not
happen because, first, the type of relation is usually introduced in the context or is
clear from the con-situation; second, the possessor is highly referential and
definite, cf.:
(185) a.b.c.d.","[171, 172]"
"The effect on language contacts on Udihe23However, the influence of Russian on Udihe syntax at the structural level is
surprisingly small compared to other minority languages of Siberia and the
Russian Far East. The following points can be noted here:
(i) Younger speakers tend to follow the Russian word order. In particular,
they place the focus object in a post-verbal position, which violates the major
requirement of Udihe word order, namely, the preverbal position of the focus
element (24.1.1). In general, the fact that verb-finality in modern Udihe is not
rigid (24.1) may be due to the influence of Russian word order. The example
below illustrates a non-head-final embedded clause generally disallowed in
Udihe but which in this case appeared under Russian influence.

seven girl
'He lived, lived, and learnt that íere were seven girls on the other side
of the sea.' (SKX216)(ii) Another violation of head-finality that may be due to influence of
Russian word order is the postnominal position of proper name apposition
(13.8.2) and the postverbal complement subordinate clause (Chapter 20).
(iii) W/i-words in Udihe are typically not used as subordinators, since clausal
subordination is mostly expressed by non-finite verbal forms; their occasional
use in this function, as in (22), is due to the Russian influence:
(22)Ali

come-REP-MUL-INT.PRP-ACC-3SG
tu: pala-wasi:-ni.
all distract-DIV-3SG
'When the father was going to come home, she distracted (her son).'(iv) Certain sentence constructions may be influenced by the corresponding
phenomenon in Russian, namely, the desiderative copular clauses with the
Dative experiencer NP (17.2.3.2), the Impersonal construction (16.1.3), and the
promotion of the nominal patient to the subject position in the Personal Passive
clause (16.1.1).
(v) Cases of ""semantic translation"" from Russian may include the use of the
interrogative pronoun jeu 'what' in tag questions, as in the meaning 'what for,
why' (9.5.1.3), and the adverbial use of the universal quantifier teu 'all; all the
time, always' (11.2.2.1.3).
(vi) Udihe has borrowed certain functional words from Russian (the
conjunctions i 'and', no 'but', a 'and, but', and others) as well as many
interjections.","[56, 57]"

22.4.1. Constructions with Reciprocal pronouns
22.4.1.1. Reciprocal object
The reciprocal meaning can be expressed exclusively by Reciprocal pronouns
when the two semantic roles that correspond to these pronouns are the agent
and the patient. Thus the Reciprocal pronoun corresponds to the direct object
role. The object Reciprocal pronouns are mej\e)i or its reduplicated variant
mef(e)i-mef(e)i 'each other' (9.3). The subject may be the Plural noun (1617),
or the collective Singular noun (1618). In the latter case the antecedent is in the
Singular. The verb always takes Plural agreement affixes. The construction is
ambiguous because it can refer to any number of participants larger than one.

modifier (the benefactive) by means of personal agreement affixes, see 13.1.","[893, 894]"
"4.2.2.2. The Accusative
In a non-reflexive noun phrase the Accusative is usually marked with the suffix
-wA- or -mA-. For the reflexive noun phrases the Accusative is homonymous
with the Nominative (4.1.4.2). The prototypical function of the Accusative is to
denote a direct object. On the definition of the direct object see 15.2. In the
direct object function the Accusative case is not always morphologically
marked, and even for non-reflexive noun phrases can sometimes coincide with
the Nominative. The issue is not entirely clear because the two likely causes of
this behavior, the phonetic and the semantic, sometimes work in combination.
In functions other than the direct object the non-reflexive Accusative is always
morphologically marked, but there is also a tendency to omit the Accusative
marker on the noun phrase that corresponds to the patient/theme argument in
Passive and Agentless Passive constructions (16.1.1, 16.1.2).",[153]

Attributive agreement in case in Udihe is limited only to the Accusative noun
phrases where the modifier is either represented by certain quantifiers (namely,
egdi 'a lot', wac'a 'little, few', teu 'all', zurje 'both', and the numerals), or, less
frequently, a relative clause (on this see 19.2.3). Within the Accusative noun
phrase the modifier that agrees with the head noun in case can be prenominai
(957) or postnominal (958). Note that the latter differs from instances of
quantifier raising (24.2.1.1.2) in two respects: (i) the postposed quantifier,
unlike the raised quantifier, agrees in case with the head noun; (ii) quantifier
raising operates independently of the syntactic position of the modifier noun,
while the postposed quantifier is limited only to the Accusative noun phrase.

below. It is not entirely clear, however, whether we are here dealing with an
instance of attributive agreement, or whether the modifier is clause-external
and should be analyzed as substantivized.
There seem to be two forms of modifier postposing. The first is motivated by
information structure considerations, namely, the afterthought status of the
postposed element. By ""afterthought"" we mean an element added after the
completion of the sentence to clarify an element of the clause, such as, for
example, sagdi bäsa-la 'a large river' in (1803a) or uti ninta-wa 'that man' in

Compound adjectives (6.4.4), pronominal adjectives, and some other
adjectives (6.1.2.1.1) do not take Plural affixes under any conditions. For such
a noun phrase plurality - if emphasized - may be expressed with the restrictive
particle m'ei (12.1.1.9.3). However, in at least two examples at our disposal, a
compound adjective bears the nominal Plural affix -ziga. Both cases involve
ideophones in the attributive position, which either precede or follow the head.

The following quantifiers are observed: quantificational nouns (13.3.3),
universal quantifiers (13.3.2), scalar quantifiers (13.3.4), and numerals (13.3.5).
The regular word order within the quantified noun phrase is
(945)quantifier — head noun (+ case affix)A preposed quantifier has the bare form; the syntactic relationship between it
and the head is not encoded morphologically. The universal quantifier teu 'all',
as well as certain scalar quantifiers and quantificational nouns allow modifier
raising (24.2.1.1). Most scalar and universal quantifiers participate in the
quantifier float construction (24.2.1.2.2). Some scalar quantifiers and numerals
may exhibit agreement in (the Accusative) case with the head (13.3.6).
Together with the Accusative case agreement between the relative clause and
its head (19.2.3), this is the only instance of attributive case agreement in
Udihe. The number of the head noun is addressed in 13.3.1.","[521, 522]"
"19.2.2. Other positions relativized
If the syntactic position relativized is other than the subject, the topicalized
relativized noun precedes the relative clause. It takes the case marker, showing its
syntactic role in the subordinate clause. The participle takes the case suffix which
marks the role of the head noun within the superordinate clause and the personal
inflection referring to the subject of the relative clause. Thus, the relativized noun
and the participle might not have the same case. The subject of the relative clause
usually precedes the relativized noun, as is demonstrated by most of the examples
cited in this section. However, it may also follow it, cf.:
(1398) a.",[720]
"9.1. Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns are pro-nouns in a strict sense, that is, their morphological
and syntactic behavior is similar to that of nouns. They inflect for case and an
(Alienable) Possessive. In a sentence, they take an argument position, or
function as determiners or adjuncts (rarely as predicates). In principle, their
overt presence in the sentence is not obligatory in most functions; for further

Reflexive pronouns are not opposed for different persons. Cases other than the
Nominative are derived from the stem me(n)- followed by the case inflection
(null for the Accusative) and the following personal inflections: -i or -mi in the
Singular and -f(e)i in the Plural. The Singular personal inflection -mi is found
in the Accusative and the Destinative; in the other cases the inflection -i is
used, which often contracts with the preceding vowel Iii (2.3.1). The inflectionsReflexive pronouns 341
-i/-mi (SG) and -fle)i (PL) coincide with the regular reflexive possessive affixes
of nouns (4.1.4.2). As distinct from nouns, the Destinative forms are
morphologically based on the Dative case. The case paradigms of the reflexive

13.2.1. The structure of the phrase
The structure of the adjectival noun phrase is:

phrase, but there is no agreement in case between it and the attribute.

"15.2.3. Direct object in Passive constructions
As shown in 16.1.1, in the Personal Passive clauses the element that
corresponds to the direct object of the active counterpart construction,
normally, the patient or theme, is encoded by the Accusative noun phrase, if it
is a noun (not a personal pronoun). In a similar fashion, the patient/theme
argument of the transitive Agentless Passive is marked for the Accusative case
(16.1.2). The crucial question is whether these elements can be identified as
subjects. The syntactic tests, described in section 15.1.1, show that the
Accusative noun phrases in passive constructions do not exhibit the cluster of
subject properties typical of the Nominative subject. In particular, they do not
control reflexivization, cf. (1095a) and (1095b); do not trigger same-subject
switch reference markers (1096); do not control the coreferential null across the
conjoined clause (1097), and do not participate in other control structures.
(1095) a.b.",[588]
"9.4.1. Anaphoric-deictic pronouns
9.4.1.1. Proximal deixis
As can be seen from the table in 9.4, the anaphoric-deictic pronouns of the
proximal deixis have suppletive stems: ei in the Nominative, a-, i- or o- in other
cases. The stem i- is likely to be the result of assimilation of the stem vowel to
the following case inflection, containing the vowel Iii. The stem ei can perhaps
be interpreted phonologically as ai or oi, since all non-high vowels are
neutralized to lei in the position before HI (2.1.3). In this case the pronominal
stem can simply be reconstructed as a-/o-, and in the Nominative it appears to
be augmented by a certain element -i.
The pronouns of the series ei can be used anaphorically, although this is not
their main function and textual anaphora is more often expressed by the
uti/ute/tei/ti: pronouns (9.6.2). Examples of the anaphoric use of the pronoun ei
are presented in 22.1.2.
Nominative forms can only function as modifiers or arguments of
postpositions, for example, the postposition bede 'like'.
(607) a.b.",[378]
"6.1. Inflection of simple adjectives
Simple adjectives either function as predicates (17.2.2.1.1), or in the attributive
function (13.3). As will be shown in 13.2, within a noun phrase which is
neutral with respect to information structure the adjective modifier is
prenominai and does not take any morphological markers except for the
optional Plural affix. When attributive adjectives undergo modifier raising
(24.2.1.1), they are postnominal and inflected for case, number, and possession.
When the head noun is not overtly present (22.2.3), or when the attributive
adjective is located discontinuously with respect to it, the adjective takes case
and number inflections. Independent adjectives in certain case forms function
as arguments (Chapter 14) and function as temporal adjuncts (15.4.2.1). Used
in the predicative function, adjectives inflect for number (17.2.2.1.4) and can
sometimes take possessive affixes (24.3.2.1).
Information on the syntax of these constructions is provided in the
corresponding sections. Here we only describe the peculiarities of the
adjectival inflection.",[206]
"366 Adverbs and postpositions
10.1.1. Spatial adverbs
Spatial adverbs with locative, lative, ablative, and prolative semantics are
derived from local cases of spatial nouns. Adverbs that denote the same
localization and form various series of related words based on the same stem
will be referred to as serial adverbs (10.1.1.1). There are no spatial adverbs that
go back to the Nominative, Destinative, and Partitive case forms, and some
other individual ""lacunas"" are possible. Furthermore, adverbial case inflections
deviate slightly from nominal inflections (4.1.3).

inflection, cf. w'e-fe 'above' and we:-we-ni 'top, surface, upper part (ACC).'
However, it is available for some adverbialized nouns, cf.: w'eh-fe b'äs'a-fa
'along mountains and rivers' (SKX 296). The adverbial Accusative forms in
'-fA can function as postpositions without personal markers (see 10.2.2). The
Ablative in -ligdeAlAgdA is attested only for a few adverbs. We do not have
enough information to deduce how its meaning differs from that of the regular
Ablative. As a rule the adverbial case suffixes tend to be replaced with standard
nominal ones.
Non-serial spatial adverbs (10.1.1.2) are typically based on one 'frozen' case
form, and do not make paradigms.","[399, 400]"
"21.2. Participial locational clauses
The participial locational clause corresponds to the adverbial clause introduced
by 'where' in European languages. It can have different spatial meanings of the
locative, lative, and ablative type. It is formed with the personal form of the
active participle, which takes the corresponding case suffix or postposition, and
the personal inflection indicating the subject of the subordinate clause. Such a
subordinate clause is formally indistinguishable from the headless relative
clause (19.5) with an empty head referring to some kind of place, and should
perhaps be analyzed as such.
The following sentences illustrate the locational adverbial clause, in which
the participle takes Locative (1491), Dative (1492), Ablative (1493), and Lative
(1494) case marking, or is followed by a locational postposition (1495).
(1491) a.b.",[764]
"If the subjects of the superordinate and the relative clause are not coreferential but
the relativized noun is the subject of the relative clause, the personal participle
forms are used. The participle takes the 3rd personal suffix and the case suffix or
the postposition marking the syntactic role of the relativized noun in the
superordinate clause.
(1397) a.b.",[719]
"4.1.1.2.3. Semantic groups
In Schneider's dictionary (Schneider 1936) about 20 nouns are in class Π. All
of them appear to belong to the native Udihe vocabulary, and they mostly
denote very basic notions. In the modern language, they are even fewer. The
reduction is likely to be motivated by the ""analogy tendency"", mentioned
already in Schneider (1936: 93), which forces the generally non-numerous
class Π nouns to lose the stem-final Ini completely and be reinterpreted as class
I nouns. For some words parallel forms such as ami-tigi and amin-tigi 'to the
father' (LAT), xoton-du and xoto-du 'in the town' (DAT), belie-tigi and
belien-tigi 'to the fairy' (LAT) appear. The variations are found among
idiolects and dialects. Other words have completely undergone the transition to
class I, such as, for example, the common Tungus word *samän 'shaman'
(Cincius 1977: 59), which does not keep the historical stem-final Ini and
appears in the modern language as a class I noun sama.
Among the class Π nouns a small semantic group of kinship terms is notable
for having special suppletive Nominative and Vocative forms (see also
12.2.1.3), while their case and possessive forms derive from a different n-final
stem:
Nominative
abuga, amita
enitje
nexuse
ag'a
exedeclension stem
Vocative
abuga-i
ami(n)'father'
eniije-i
eni(n)'mother'
neyu-i
nequ(n)'younger sibling'
ag'a-i
' ai(η )'elder brother,
uncle; an address to a man by a child'
exe-i
exi(n)'elder sister,
aunt; an address to a woman by a child'However, these two types of stem are often mixed in speech, and the
Nominative stem also sometimes takes the Plural, case, and Possessive
suffixes. For example, the old possessive forms, derived from the class Π
declension stem, such as ami-mi 'my father' and neyu-mi 'my younger sibling',
can be replaced by the possessive forms, derived from the Nominative stem,
such as abuga-i and nerju-i, correspondingly.
The names of the local rivers Xu:(n) 'Khor', Ima(n) 'Iman', and Biki(n)
'Bikin' belong to class Π as well, cf. for example, the Locative form Xu:n-dile
'on the Khor'. This fact is reflected in the Russian form of the two of these
hydronyms ending in Ini (Bikin and Iman). But the variants that follow the classNominal inflection 103
I noun declension pattern, such as Biki-le 'on Bikin' <Bikin-LOC>, are also
often used.
The list of other nouns that generally preserve their class Π peculiarities in
the modem language is presented below.

Participles, certain quantifiers and postpositions), do not show such a strong
analogy tendency if they belong morphonologically to class Π. Basically they
preserve the original class Π declension rather well.","[136, 137]"
"4.2.2.8. The Instrumental
The Instrumental case is marked by the suffix -zi. As an argument and an
adjunct, the Instrumental noun phrase can have a large range of meanings that
can be covered by the general label 'circumstance' or 'means' (the means
employed for the action). On valence patterns with the Instrumental case see
14.3.4 and 14.4.5. The Instrumental noun phrase can express the period of time
(15.4.2.4). As a manner adjunct it denotes means of conveyance, price,
instrument, circumstance, sometimes the cause, the way of transmission of
information, the source of information, or the material used (15.4.3). The
comitative meaning of the Instrumental noun phrase ('with somebody') is
common. The Instrumental comitative noun phrase functions as a determiner
within a larger noun phrase (13.6.1) or as a kind of a comitative adjunct
(15.4.6). Besides, it can mark the counter-agent participant of a reciprocal
situation (16.1.6.2.1, 14.3.4.2).",[160]
"534Grammatical relations15.1.1.1. Nominative case
The following elements are encoded as the Nominative noun phrase:
(i) the first argument of the non-passive matrix clause (Chapter 14) which
corresponds to the only argument of the intransitive verb or the agent argument
of the transitive verb;
(ii) the same argument in the subordinate clauses (Chapters 19-21);
(iii) the pronominal patient/theme argument of the Passive constructions
(16.1.1); note that the lexical patient/theme of the Passive is marked with the
Accusative case and does not exhibit other subject properties (15.2.3,
16.1.1.2.2);
(iv) the only argument of most copular constructions (17.2.2).
As shown in Chapter 14, most verbs take the Nominative subject, the only
exceptions being null-argument verbs (14.1). The Nominative noun phrase is
absent in Agentless Passive sentences (16.1.2), in Passive sentences where the
patient/theme is a lexical noun phrase (16.1.1.2.2), as well as in agentless
non-passive sentences (16.2.5).","[569, 570]"
