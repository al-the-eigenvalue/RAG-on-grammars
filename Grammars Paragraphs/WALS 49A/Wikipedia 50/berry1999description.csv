"4. 1 COREGRAMMAR ANDGRAMMATlCALRELATIONS
The basic word order of an Abun clause, like all other West Papuan Phylum languages, is
SUBJECT VERB OBJECT.
Firstly, in regard to subjects, Andrews ( 1 985: 1 04) points out that in a great many
languages a subject grammatical relation is clearly marked by the coding features of ordinary
main clauses. For example, in English, subjects are primari ly marked by the coding feature
of preverbal position, and in some limited cases indicated by case marking and cross­
referencing. Abun subjects are similar to English because they are clearly encoded by word
order. No case-marking or other coding devices signify an Abun subject. Rather, Abun
subjects are always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately precedes the
verb.
The direct object in an Abun transitive clause is also encoded by word order alone. The
Abun object is always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately follows the
verb, except in certain contexts where the object can be fronted (see §4.7.2).
According to Andrews ( 1 985:69), the first step in analysing the system of grammatical
relations in a language is to identify A, S, and 0, where A is transitive subject (prototypically
an agent), S is intransitive subject (either agent or patient) and 0 is transitive object
(prototypically a patient). Typologically languages differ according to how these grammatical
relations group. Nominative/accusative systems combine A and S functions, whereas
absolutive/ergative systems combine S and 0 functions.
On this basis, Abun is a nominative-accusative language since it combines the S and A
functions. Abun combines S and A on a syntactic level, the syntactic coding being word
order. S and A precede the verb, whereas 0 follows the verb. In an intransitive clause, a4849ClAUSE STRUCTUREsubject (S) precedes the verb, as in example 4. 1 . The same is true for a transitive clause, the
subject (A) precedes the verb and an object (0) fol lows, as in 4.2.","[60, 61]"

9.5 RELATIVECLAUSE FDRMAnON STRAlEGYIn any relative construction, the noun phrase that is denoted 'head' holds a gramm atical
relation in both clauses of that construction, namely in the main clause and in the relative
clause. Cross-linguistically, it appears that there is more significant variation in encoding the
grammatical relation of the head in the embedded clause, than is found in the main clause
(Comrie 1 989: 147, 1 53). Comrie distinguishes four major strategies for encoding the head
within the relative clause. These he terms non-reduction, pronoun retention, relative pronoun
and gap (Comrie 1989: 147). Non-reduction means ""that the head noun appears in full,
unreduced form, in the embedded sentence, in the normal position and/or with the normal
case marking"". With pronoun retention, the head noun is represented in the embedded clause
as a pronoun. When a relative pronoun is used, it is in clause-initial position and it is marked
for case. With any of these three strategies the role of the head noun within the relative clause
is overtly indicated ( 1 989 : 1 5 1 ). The fourth strategy, however, does not provide any overt
indication at all of the role of the head within the relative clause. The head is actually omitted
from the relative clause. For this reason it is called a gap strategy. A study of Abun relative
clause structure shows that Abun uses the fourth strategy in Comrie' s list, the gap strategy.
Abun does not make any overt reference to the head noun within the restricting clause.
The embedded clause does not retain a pronoun referring to the head noun, nor is there a
relative clause pronoun which specifically refers to the head noun, nor is there a full noun
phrase inside the embedded clause. The head is omitted in the restricting clause, thereby
creating a gap. But since the restricting clause does not contain any reference to the head
noun, how can one know what grammatical relation the relativised argument holds?
As explained in Chapter 4, Abun does not actually mark the case of nouns. The
gramm atical relations of Subject, Object and so on are normally marked by word order.
Therefore, it is the word order of the relative clause and the location of the gap created by the
omission of the head that provide the clues for encoding the gramm atical relation of the head.
For example:
9.22M e mu gu y e

We (will) go (and) kill the person who has slept with our woman (woman
from our clan).","[163, 164]"
"2324CHAPTER 3The second index that Comrie discusses is the index of fusion, which measures the extent
to which morphemes within the word are readily segmentable, with the extremes being
agglutination and fusion. The few affixes which occur in Abun are easily segmentable. There
is some slight variability of morpheme shape predictable in terms of general phonological
rules discussed in §2.5. Abun, then, has an agglutinating morphology within its relatively
small amount of polymorpherruc words. Very little fusion is evident.
Comrie ( 1 989:46ff.) discusses several languages in relation to the index of fusion
including Turkish, Hungarian and Russian. Turkish is relatively agglutinating, Hungarian
exhibits more fusion, and Russian even more fusion again. Abun, however, is more like
Turkish in that it is close to the agglutinating end of the continuum.
Therefore, Abun is an isolating language, mostly monosyllabic. In the few cases of
affixation and word compounding that do occur, the morphemes are easily segmentable.
The implications of very little affixation in Abun are that other strategies are required to
effect what is normally achieved through affixation. For example, in many languages
affixation on the head of a noun phrase defines grammatical relations. However, in Abun,
word order alone defines core grammatical relations, while prepositions are used with
obliques. Number is expressed with a classifier and a number word, rather than an affix.
Possession is not marked with an affix, but instead a linker is used between the possessor
and the possessum.
Very little affixation occurs on Abun verbs. Instead of person/number agreement affixes
on verbs, only free form pronouns are used. While other languages in the West Papuan
Phylum have both free pronorrunal forms and person/number prefixes on verbs, including
the most closely related language, Maibrat, Abun does not. Time adverbs, temporal
prepositional phrases and some conjunctions indicate notions of time normally carried by
tense affixes. Polarity, aspect, mood and modality are conveyed by the use of particles, not
by affixation on verbs as is common in Papuan languages (Foley 1 986).
The processes of word-building in Abun are therefore rather lirruted. The following
processes are evident: lirruted suffixation on verbs (§3 . 3 . 1 ) ; three prefixes for nouns (§3.3.2);
word compounding, principally in nouns (§3.3 .2); and some adjectives are used as manner
adverbs (§3.3.3 and §3.3 .4).","[35, 36]"
"9.3 THE RELATIVE CONJUNcrION gato
The relative conjunction gato is made up of two morphemes: ga 'anaphoric referent/the
former' and to ' noun modifying particle (NMP) ' . Gato may be translated as 'that' , 'which' ,
'who' and so on. In quick speech it is abbreviated to ga, indicating that the particle to, which
carries a grammatical meaning rather than a lexical one, is not always considered necessary.
Gato is not a relative clause pronoun since neither ga nor to can be used on their own to
replace nouns, as will be further discussed below. However, gato cannot be described as a
general subordinating conj unction (as is the case with English 'that' ). Gato is exclusively
used to mark constructions of the restrictive relative clause type. A study of its two
component morphemes shows how it fulfils this role.",[160]
"CHAPTER 1 1
ADVERBIAL CLAUSES1 1 . 1 lNTRODUCfION
Various terms are used to describe how, within a single sentence, clauses interact to form
a meaningful unit. Terms such as 'interclausal coherence' (Givon 1 990), 'relationships
within the clause complex' (Halliday 1 985) and even 'clause combining' (Matthiessen &
Thompson 1 988) are among recent descriptions of what has been traditionally termed
subordination. Traditionally, as Thompson and Longacre ( 1 985: 1 72) state, three types of
subordinate clause have been distinguished:
those which function as noun phrases (called complements) [=noun clauses],
those which function as modifiers of nouns (relative clauses), and those which
function as modifiers of verb phrases or entire propositions (called adverbial
clauses).
Relative clauses and noun clauses have been described in the earlier Chapters 9 and 10. In
this chapter we will begin a discussion of the third kind of subordinate clause, ' adverbial
clauses' , as they are found in Abun.
Adverbial subordinate clauses are said to modify a sentence in the same way that an
adverb modifies a verb. Since the sentences that contain these subordinate clauses consist
minimally of two clauses, one clause could be termed the Head and the other the Modifier
(Halliday 1 985 : 1 92). Usually one clause, often termed the main clause, is said to be
grammatically 'free' or independent. As such it can stand on its own as a single clause. The
subordinate clause is marked in some way, such as by means of verbal inflection, to indicate
that it is 'bound' or dependent and thus cannot stand alone as a single clause. Languages that
permit clauses to be joined in this way normally permit an alternative, termed coordination.
In these cases the clauses, although joined together in some way, may stand on their own as
independent clauses. However, there is another quite different type of ""interclausal
grammatical organization"" (to use Givon ' s terminology 1 990: 864). This type is known as
'clause chaining' (Longacre 1985). Longacre states that languages of the clause-chaining
variety do not offer the grammatical options of subordinate-independent and coordinate
constructions. ''The subordinate/coordi nate distinction is irrelevant [in that there is no choice
between the two] and both are absorbed into the medial/final distinction."" (Longacre
1 985:239). To demonstrate this Longacre gives two English sentences which illustrate the
subordinatelcoordinate options of a language such as English. These sentences, given below
as I L I a and 1 1 . 1 b, would not be syntactically distinct in a language of the clause-chaining
type.
1 1 . 1 a. After chopping the wood, John carried it to his house.","[201, 202]"
"10.2.2 USE OF do PRECEDING LESS TIIAN A RJLL CLAUSE
It was stated above that do identified a complement and that this was always a full clause.
There are cases where do does not precede a full clause. Where this is the case, the
complement consists of a single noun phrase only. One instance of this will be looked at
under § 1 O.2.3 'Noun complementation' . The following examples show cases where a phrase
and not a clause follows the complementiser.

"172CHAPTER 1010.2.4 COMPLEMENT CLAUSE STRUCI1JRE IN ABUN
When a subordinate clause is a complement, it is common for the complement to function
as the subject or object of the larger clause into which it is embedded. In Abun , complements
may function as objects of a clause and this type of complement will be described under
§ 1 O.3. However, the type of subordinate clause that has been under discussion here, those
that are identified by the complementiser do, do not function in this way.
At this stage it may be relevant to restate the criteria that determines which constituent i s
the object i n a n Abun clause. A s stated i n §4. 1 , ""The direct object in a n Abun transitive
clause is also encoded by word order alone. Abun objects are always the constituent realised
by a noun phrase that immediately follows the verb . . . "" Since there is no case marking on
nouns, this cannot be used to identify the object. The rigid word order of the Abun language
does not allow passivisation and so this cannot serve to identify the object either. Unlike the
dative relation the object is not identified by a particular preposition. The object i s
distinguished from the subject o n the sole criteria o f word order.
When the complementiser is used, the constituent that follows the complementiser does
not function as the direct object of the main clause. Three arguments are put forward here to
support this analysis:(1)
(2)
(3)A do-clause can follow an intransitive verb.
When the verb is transitive a do-clause can co-occur with the direct object.
Abun word order indicates that a do-clause functions as an oblique.","[183, 184]"

houseThe noun phrase that represents the possessor undergoes no morphological change when
it is j uxtaposed or linked to the possessum. The possessum likewise is not marked
morphologically in any way. Even the linker, bi, can be shown to be a free form (and will be
in §5.3.2) and thus be considered separate from both the possess urn and the possessor. Abun
possessive phrases syntactically appear to be like coordinate noun phrases, one form
juxtaposed and the other using the linker bi as the coordinating particle, j ust as si is used to
conjoin noun phrases (see §5.7).
Consistent with the absence of morphological marking in possessive phrases noted here,
Abun does not have a set of possessive pronouns, but uses the same set of pronouns as are
used in all other phrase types. I n contrast to this, in an early cursory analysis of Abun
(previously named Karon), Voorhoeve wrote (in Wurm 1 975:720) that possessive prefixes
had been noted with kinship terms: tabai ' my father' and nambai 'your father' , being cited
as examples. However in slow speech these two forms are: tat bi ai ' ISG POSS father: my
father' and nan bi ai'2SG POSS father: your father' (these phrases are in the Abun Tat dialect,
where tat is ' l sG ' ). No markings are made on either the head or the dependent in possessive
phrases. The same pronouns are employed in possessive phrases as in noun phrases that
occur in subject and object positions, that is, there is no special set of possessive pronouns
in Abun. In this way Abun differs from many other languages.
The choice of which type of possessive construction to employ is determined by the
lexicon. The inalienable class of nouns which includes body parts, name, and analogously,
the parts of whole-part relationships such as trunk of tree and scales of fish (as discussed in
§3.3.2.3), is restricted and could be considered a closed set. All other nouns belong to an
open set of nouns and include names of places, objects, kinship terms, and advice. Many
languages with the alienable/inalienable distinction include kinship terms in the inalienable
category, but, in Abun, kinship terms are considered to be alienable.
Now we tum to a more detailed discussion of each of the two types of genitive
constructions, inalienable (§5.3 . 1 ) and alienable (§5.3 .2).",[90]
"4CHAPTER 11.5.2 PAPUAN VERSUS AUS1RONESIAN FFATURfS OFTIIE AEUN LANGUAGE
Wurm's classification of Abun as a Papuan language seems to be based mainly on its
lexical inventory, with special reference to its set of personal pronouns. There are a
considerable number of Austronesian loan words in the West Papuan (WP) Phylum
languages, and when only non-Austronesian lexical items are compared, the lexical
interrelationship between the WPP languages is much closer. WPP languages in the Bird's
Head contain a small Trans New Guinea (TNG) Phylum lexical element, some of which
may be due to borrowing from the South Bird's Head Stock (which is part of the TNG
Phylum), or may be traces of an old TNG Phylum substratum (Wurm 1 982:204). The
personal pronouns are clearly Papuan, belonging to Wurm's set III (Wurm 1 982:40). Abun
personal pronouns do not distinguish between first person plural inclusive and exclusive,
whereas this is universal for Austronesian languages. Neither are there bound subject
markers on the verb, which is a feature of Austronesian languages. Thus Abun' s pronouns
are more akin to Papuan languages than to Austronesian languages.
Other Papuan (or perhaps non-Austronesian) features include: no bound subject markers
on the verb, phonologically relevant tone and an irrealis-realis (or non-pasUpast) distinction
which is marked only on complex sentences. Perhaps the most striking Papuan features of
Abun syntax are found at the level of the complex sentence. In some Abun complex
sentences there is no clear syntactic marking to distinguish those clauses which could be
considered subordinate from those which might be termed coordinate. This lack of
subordinate/coordinate distinction is found in Papuan clause-chaining languages. Likewise, in
Papuan clause-chaining languages the semantic notions of temporal sequence and
simultaneity are strongly marked (Longacre 1985:264). These notions also feature strongly in
Abun complex sentences.
However, Abun has a number of Austronesian features. Most notable is the rigid word
order of svo as distinct from the Papuan SOY word order (Wurm 1 982:64). Other significant
Austronesian features include: a very simple derivational morphology; uncomplicated and
very little inflectional affixation; the common use of particles where verb affixation would be
used in Papuan languages; the use of prepositions instead of postpositions or case marking;
no special sentence-medial verbs; a decimal numbering system unlike the normal Papuan
binary, trinary or quinary systems (Wurm 1 982:64); the existence of reduplicated adverbs;
simple morphophonemic changes and the common use of labialised consonants.
Despite these features which could make it appear that grammatically Abun has more in
common with Austronesian languages, Abun has some unique features which distinguish it
from both Papuan and Austronesian languages. The use of particles in Abun is so extensive
that it is far greater than in Austronesian languages such as Indonesian. Particles are the main
means of grammatical communication, with affixation playing an extremely minor role. Due
to the lack of affixation in Abun syntax, other grammatical strategies have been developed. In
particular, the use of bracketing (whereby two particles act as boundary markers for a
particular grammatical constituent) serves to identify some important grammatical features,
namely negation, interrogatives and relative clauses. Therefore, Abun does not neatly fit into
either of the neighbouring language classifications, that is Austronesian or Papuan, but shares
features of both.","[15, 16]"
"3.3.2.4 NOUN COMPOUNDS AND THE i- PREFIX
After the initial reference to a 'whole-part' type noun in a discourse, further reference can
be made to the item by replacing the morpheme representing the whole with the prefix, i- .
Therefore, after an initial reference to kwenat, additional reference to that item later in the
discourse is made by using the prefix i- as a pronominal referent, and so the form would be
i-nat 'its-leaves ' . Likewise with the other types of whole-part relationships, ndam-go
becomes i-go 'its-feathers' , wo-dar becomes i-dar 'its-scales' and yor-ot becomes i-ot 'its­
tip ' . In such words both morphemes are bound.
In human whole-part relationships or inalienable possession, the prefix i- is not used,
rather the person ' s name or person pronoun is used, for example Musa syim ' Musa ' s
arm/hand' , ji syim ' m y arm/hand' , an gwes 'his/her leg'. The possessive pronoun for
human inalienable possession is the same as the subject and object pronoun for each person.
Furthermore, the body part (syim, 'arm', gwes ' leg' etc.) may occur as a free form and is not
a bound morpheme, as is the case of the 'part' in non-human whole-part relationships.
Therefore, the prefix i- is only used as an inalienable possessive pronoun prefix for non-35MORPHOLOGYAND WORD ClASSEShuman referents, replacing the 'whole ' in the whole-part relationship in the same way a
pronoun replaces a noun.","[46, 47]"
"CHAPTER 450
4.2 ABUN AND lHE GRAMMATICAL RElATIONS HJERARONBlake ( 1 990: 1 ) summarises some of the basic notions of relational grammar and includes
a discussion of grammatical relations that can be arranged in a hierarchy, namely subject,
object, indirect object and obliques (that is, adjuncts). Each level of the hierarchy can be
distinctly marked; for example, the presence of case marking or adpositions tends to be
associated with the oblique end of the hierarchy.
In arranging the grammatical relations of the Abun language in a hierarchy, it can be seen
that each level is marked in a distinct way, as listed in Table 3 . 1 8 below. First, the subject is
marked by word order; it is simply preverbal. Second, the object also is marked by word
order; it is postverbal. Next, at the level of indirect object, a change in marking takes place.
Higher in the hierarchy, word order alone marks the grammatical relations, but for indirect
objects and obliques grammatical relations are marked by prepositions, with word order
taking a secondary role.","[61, 62]"
"3 .3.2.5 RELATOR NOUNS
The final noun subclass is relator nouns. These may appear in some cases as the head or
as a modifier in a locative prepositional phrase (see §5.4.2 for examples). Words in this
subclass can be broken into two subsubclasses, those that stand on their own and those that
compound with de 'side ' . There are nine in the former group and six in the latter. These are
listed in the following two tables:TABLE 3.4: RElATOR NOUNS

Adjectives are a class of words denoting qualities or attributes, which in Abun functionally
modify nouns and frequently function as predicates as in example 3.4 1 a. Adjectives are
distinct from verbs in that they function as head of adjectival phrases and, in those phrases,
can specify degree such as comparative and superlative as in example 3.4 1b, c. Furthermore,CHAPTER 336although structurally both adjectives and verbs directly follow the predicate marker yo, verbs
never directly precede the intensifier wai, whereas adjectives do.
3.4 1 a.","[47, 48]"
"5.2 NOUN PHRASES
An Abun noun phrase typically has the following structure:HEAD (MODIFIERS) (DETERMrNER)
The head of a noun phrase is normally filled by a member of the noun word class as in
example 5 . 10, but may also be filled by a pronoun, as in 5. 1 1 , with a restricted set of
modifiers. In other words, other nouns and adjectives do not co-occur with a pronoun when
it is head of a noun phrase; only classifiers, quantifiers and determiners may co-occur with
pronouns, as seen in 5 . 1 1 .",[79]
"Comrie's definition, given earlier, (Comrie 1 989: 1 43) that a relative clause consists
minimally of a head and a restricting clause does not seem to leave room for a relative
conjunction as a unit in its own right within the relative clause. Under Comrie ' s definition, it
is necessary to place such items as relative pronouns or relative markers within the restricting
clause. For instance relative pronouns are considered clause-initial. However, since gato is
not a relative pronoun it cannot be considered as part of the restricting clause. Regarding the
particle ga this is always a part of a noun phrase. For example, it is possible to say Yohana ga
'Yohana who I just mentioned' or an ga 'he, the one I just mentioned' , as described in §9.3 . 1
above. B ut this i s not the case for the particle to. I t i s not possible to say Yohana to, for this
has no meaning. Because the grammatical function of to is to identify a subordinate structure
of some kind, it cannot stand as part of a noun phrase, but rather it is the initial component of
the subordinate structure.
The two morphemes of gata thus enable it to behave as a conjunction or linker. The first
morpheme, ga, could be said to be actually part of the noun phrase head of the relative clause.
The second morpheme to is the initial component of the restricting clause. The combined
form, gato, therefore behaves like a bridge or linker between both head and restricting clause,
giving rise to the description stated earlier in §9. 1 .",[162]

phrase itself and the whole utterance would be considered as two noun phrases conjoined,
with si no being the second noun phrase. For further discussion of complex phrases see
§5.7.",[89]
"10.3. 1 MEANs OF IDENTIFYING TIlE COMPLEMENT CLAUSE IN ABUN
Since this particular clause type contains no complementiser, what is the basis for
assuming that these are complement clauses? These clauses are without any type of marking
and lack some means of syntactic identification which could identify them as complements.
There is a type of complement termed 'paratactic' which does not use a complementiser.
These clauses are not subordinate but rather are considered as independent clauses capable of
standing on their own.24 All of the constituents which follow the predicates in examples
10.55 to 10.53 above have the structure of a simple Abun clause. For instance an jam mo j i
'she listens to (or obeys) me' from 1 0.50 and ye mwa maskwa yu 'many people were angry
with each other' from 1 0.52 are all good Abun clauses. It could be possible then to consider
these clauses as paratactic complements since they are capable of standing on their own as
independent clauses. Given that the complex sentences that contain these clauses are
unmarked to indicate embedding or subordination, what means can be used to identify them
as subordinate complement clauses, embedded within the larger sentence?
Giv6n has listed several means by which complement clauses can be syntactically
encoded ( 1 990:538ff). These various means show some type of syntactic variation by which
it can be determined that the clause functions as an argument of a predicate. One such type of
syntactic evidence he terms 'predicate raising' which results in forms like 'let go' or 'make
eat' . Abun does not appear to have any of these forms. Another means is through case
marking of the subject of the complement verb. Since Abun is a language which lacks any
form of case marking, this is not a means through which a complement clause could be
marked. Another means again is that of a subordinating morpheme or complementiser.
Complement clause types with such a marker have been described earlier (in § 1O.2 above).
He lists one other means of encoding a clause as a complement clause, that of verb
morphology or finiteness. In these cases, the complement clause is usually reduced with the
verb not taking a subject and the verb morphology being distinct from that found in
24See Noonan ( 1 985:59-60) for a discussion on this.",[190]

they refer to the subject, object or possessor. See Table 3 . 1 4 in §3.4.4 for a ful l list of

"12.5 INflUENCE OF THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE ON ABUN COMPlEX SENTENCE SlRUcruRE
Over recent years a growing number of Abun speakers have become bilingual and speak
the national language, B ahasa Indonesia. However, the number of those who are reasonably
fluent is still smal l. This means that the influence of Bahasa Indonesia on Abun complex
sentence structure is not yet great. Abun complex sentences differ quite markedly from
Indonesian complex sentences. There are also several conj unctions in Indonesian which have
no Abun counterpart. The most common of these are kalau 'if' , sebelum 'before' and atau
'or' . Some Abun speakers add these Indonesian words alongside the existing Abun form.
As yet these are not used to replace the Abun forms which represent these concepts.
The Indonesian language has, in a small way, influenced the structure of the Abun
complex sentence. All Abun conjunctions are sentence-medial so that sentence structure is as
follows (constituency aside):CLAUSE 1 + CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 2
However, there are Indonesian conjunctions which are sentence-initial. These sentences
have the following structure:CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 1 + CLAUSE 2
This pattern has influenced Abun sentence structure in two cases. The first is with the
concessive conjunction kap-re 'although ' . The second is with the logical conj unction sane
'so' .
(i) kap-re 'although'Kap-re is actually a noun phrase meaning 'this (period of) time ' . Kap 'time (unspecified) '
is an older word which is infrequently used. It survives as a variant of 'when
(INTERROGATIVE)' , kap u ? 'when?' . The other variant is kam u ? 'day which/when ?'. Kapre
has come to be used as a conjunction meaning 'although/even though' . Of the existing Abun
conjunctions there is none that has the equivalent meaning of 'although' .4 3 Indonesian,
however, is a language which strongly marks the semantic notion of concession. There are a
number of forms which can be used including meskipun 'although ' , walaupun 'although'
and also sungguhpun and sekalipun. Therefore it appears that the Abun temporal phrase kap­
re has undergone a category change. In doing so, it fi lls a semantic concept which is strongly
marked in the national language, but was not explicitly marked in Abun.",[229]
"Apart from the conjunction sa, this temporal relationship can be indicated by the time
word sugane 'at that time/then' which occurs in 1 1 . 1 8.
1 1 .2. 1 .5 sa- READS 'CONDmONAL'
The conjunction sa is most commonly used as a general temporal subordinator as
described above and as such would best be translated into English as 'when ' . However, sa
can also be extended in its meaning to include the semantic concept of condition and also to
include subjunctive modality. Longacre ( 1 985 :265), in describing clause-chaining languages,
states that ""Temporal relations appear to be central in these languages and are extended
metaphorically in other directions."" Certainly in regard to the conjunction sa, which normally
functions as a temporal subordinating conjunction, its usage can be extended to include the
notion of condition. Abun has no single lexical item that could be translated as 'if' . There are
a number of ways that the semantic concept of 'condition' is conveyed in Abun. One of
them is by means of the conjunction sa used together with the time words be/bere
'later/will/future' . When the second clause of the complex sentence containing sa is marked
by be/bere, the sentence has the same meaning as a conditional sentence and can be
translated as 'if. ..then ' . Also in some cases these sentences could be translated in a way that
could be considered as 'subjunctive' . 3 6 Because sa is a conjunction which conveys time
setting or 'tense ' , these sentences, although referring to hypothetical events, must be marked
as being in the past. It could be stated that a past tense or realis 'conditional' conjunction is a
35
36The fact that Abun grammar can mark the temporal notion of simultaneity in three overt ways, by
the conjunctions sa and saresa and by the clitic -i, indicates the grammatical importance of this
notion.
The notions often termed 'subjunctive' are more emphatically conveyed by the compound
conjunction sane-sa 'had that been the case ' . This conjunction is discussed in the following
chapter, § 1 2.5.",[209]
"ADVERBIAL CLAUSES1 93There are a few other conjunctions which are used to link adverbial clauses which do not
fit neatly into the four groups listed above. Two of these are adverbials which show some
influence of the national language, B ahasa Indonesia, upon their usage. The other is a noun
modifier which has come to be used as a conjunction. This chapter will look only at
postpositional conjunctions, described as 'tensed' conjunctions. The following chapter will
discuss prepositional conjunctions and compounding conjunctions.
1 1 .2 'TENSED' CONJUNCTIONS
The Abun language does not distinguish a separate category of 'tense' for simple clauses.
Simple clauses are marked by means of particles for mood, that is for sentences which are
interrogative and imperative, for aspect, and for modality. None of these particles i s
obligatory and when used is always found in the clause-final position (see §4.5 for a fuller
description of this). However, there are two conjunctions frequently used in Abun which
mark the clauses concerned in time frames in a less defined way than is normally the case for
tense marking. Foley ( 1 986: 1 59ff.), in his comparison of Papuan languages, uses a term
'status' to describe time settings which are less precisely defined than the traditional term
'tense' . His term STATUS can be loosely divided two ways, into 'real ' time and 'unreal' time.
'Real' status refers to events occurring both in the past and present up to the moment of
speaking. 'Unreal ' status is for events that are yet to occur, including not only those that are
considered certain but also only those in the scope of the possible or hypothetical. In Abun
this distinction is marked by two temporal conjunctions: sa, which is considered 'REAUS',
and yo ' IRREALIS ' . For Abun usage the term REALIS is used to refer to events which are already
past or are continuing up to the present time. The term IRREAUS i s used to refer to events that
are yet to happen, are likely to happen or are completely hypothetical. 3 2
Interestingly in his comparison of Papuan languages. Foley distinguishes aspect and
modality (his 'inner operators' ) from tense, status and mood ( ,outer operators ' ). Foley does
not use the term 'mood' but instead describes it as 'illocutionary force' (see Foley
1 986: 143ff.). In Papuan languages aspect and modality are usually indicated in some way on
the verb stem and are part of the predicate. B ut tense and the other 'outer operators' tend to
be realised grammatically in different ways, on the sentence level. While Abun has not been
classified as a Papuan language but is rather a West Papuan language, nevertheless this
generalisation made for Papuan languages appears to have some significance. In Abun,
aspect and modality particles are always part of a single clause. Status, that is the difference
between realis and irrealis time, occurs only at the complex sentence level. In this way there
appears to be a distinction in that the concepts of REAUS and IRREAUS are not marked on the
individual clause in Abun, as is commonly the case in many languages, but are marked on
the sentence by means of a conjunction.
The usage of these two 'tensed' or temporal conjunctions in Abun sentences is compared
below.","[204, 205]"
"CHAPTER 8
NEGATIONNegation may take a variety of forms, such as 'negative verbs ' , negative particles or fully
bound deri vational morphemes (Payne 1 985b: 222). According to Payne, the use of negative
particles is the most likely form of negation, as is the case in Abun.
This chapter presents the negation strategy used in Abun. Two particles form the basis of
negation. The primary particle is nde, which is a typical particle, a function word that is
invariant. Consistent with the isolating nature of the Abun language, nde does not vary for
tense, aspect, number or agreement. While nde is primary, a further particle, yo, also
invariant, is used in conj unction with it, mainly in the negation of indicative sentences. These
two particles bracket the predicate. In Abun, whenever two particles are used like this, the
function is to mark the extent of a particular grammatical constituent. Bracketing by a pair of
particles not only is one of the main strategies used in negation, but also is used in the
formation of relative clauses, both restrictive and unrestrictive (see §9), as well as
interrogative sentences (see §6. 1 ). In most cases of negation, the pair of particles yo . . nde
bracket the predicate to negate Abun sentences.
.","[142, 143]"
"153RELATNE CLAUSES9.5. 1 THE ROLE OF mE DETERMINER
It was said in §9. 1 above that some restncl1ve relative clauses are closed with a
determiner. The demonstrative pronouns re 'this' and ne 'that' have several functions in
Abun and one of these is to behave as a determiner. Unlike English determiner usage it is not
obligatory to use the determiner after a noun in Abun.
What factors govern the use of the determiner in the relative clause? It is not found in
every instance of a restrictive relative clause. Example 9.22 above has no determiner, in
contrast to example 9.23, in which the restrictive relative clause is closed by the determiner
ne. These two examples differ in two ways. Firstly, in example 9.22 the relativised argument
of the clause has the grammatical relation of subject. In 9.23 the relativised argument has the
grammatical relation of object. Secondly, due to Abun word order the location of the gap in
each restricting clause is different. In example 9.22 the gap is clause-initial since the subject in
Abun is clause-initial. In 9.23 the gap would have been clause-final if the determiner had not
closed the restricting clause. The determiner, by closing the clause, actually assists in locating
the gap, and thereby assists in encoding the grammatical relation of the head.
The determiner's role in locating the gap is most clearly seen when a direct object is to be
relativised. The determiner ne is used frequently when a direct object is to be relativised, but
not in all instances. To understand how the determiner is used in locating the gap in the
restricting clause, several examples are set out below. In example 9.24 to 9.27 both the head
and the relative conjunction have been highlighted. Further elements within the restricting
clause are underlined to show where the determiner has been omitted. Example 9.24 shows
the determiner as it normally appears, at the end of the relative clause.","[164, 165]"
"9.5.2 ABUN RELATIVEClAUSES ANDTHE ACCESSIBILITY H1ERARCHY
Keenan and Comrie ( 1 977) in their work on relative clauses devised a hierarchy they
called the Accessibility Hierarchy which summarised their findings across a wide sample of
languages. They had investigated the types of constraints across languages on which
grammatical relations could be relativised. Comrie ( 1 989: 1 56) later refined this hierarchy so
that ""The hierarchy subject > direct object > non-direct object > possessor defines ease of
accessibility to relative clause formation"". He stated that ( 1 989: 1 56): ""if a language can form
relative clauses on a given position on the hierarchy, it can also form relative clauses on all
positions higher (to the left) on the hierarchy"".
How do Abun relative clauses compare to this hierarchy? Does this hierarchy hold true
for Abun? In §9.5 . 1 above, several examples were given which showed that various
positions along the hierarchy could be relativised. In fact in Abun all positions on Comrie's
Accessibility Hierarchy can be relativised.
Keenan ( 1 985 : 1 56), when referring to the different strategies that a language may use to
form relative clauses, noted that ""pronoun retaining strategies are (a) more effective means of
forming RCS (restrictive relative clauses) than RPRO (relative pronoun) or gapping strategies"",14
15Probably the formula should contain ± OBJECT, but n o examples with a n object occur i n the corpus
of data.
It i s our experience i n living among Abun speakers that such errors that Giv6n imagines rarely arise.
Because word order is the main means of encoding grammatical relations, there are very strong
internal expectations in the mind of the hearer. These expectations are not necessary for languages
which use case marking or affixation for deriving meaning. The device of the boundary marker is
strongly used throughout Abun grammar to assist hearers in encoding meaning. It is used in
negative constructions and in interrogatives. Here, also, the dual particles involved could be
considered as 'bracketing' devices. These are discussed more fully Chapters 6 and 8.",[167]
"5.3 POSSESSNE PHRASES
Abun has two types of possessive constructions which, in other languages, have been
referred to as 'alienable' and 'inalienable' possession (Crystal 1 985: 1 2). Alienable
possession is that type of possession where the item possessed (hereafter known as
possessum) is seen as having only a temporary or non-essential dependence on the
possessor, such as 'his house' or 'the woman ' s book' . On the other hand, inalienable
possession is where the possessum has a permanent or necessary relationship with the
possessor such as ' her arm ' .
O f the ten different genitive construction types discussed b y Croft ( 1 990:28-32), Abun
makes use of only two, and uses them to distinguish between alienable and inalienable
possession. The first of these construction types used in Abun is simple j uxtaposition of two
noun phrases; one representing the possessor and one representing the posses sum. This type
of construction is used to form Abun inalienable genitive constructions, as in example 5.69.
Frequently the noun phrases are realised by only a pronoun and a noun, j uxtaposed in that
order, as seen in 5.70.",[89]
"1 83COMPLEMENT CLAUSESrelation. In fact there is no marking anywhere in the structure to show what is the object or
where various constituent divisions can be made. The evidence previously given attempts to
establish that these clauses function as a single unit. If this is not the case then what follows
these verbs must be two divisions: one for the noun phrase which will function as the object
and a second division for what is left, a truncated subjectless clause. This is the type of
division that is made in Relational Grammar, where only part of the embedded clause
assumes the function of direct object and the rest takes the relation of chOmeur 'unemployed'
(Blake: I 990:93ff.). It is a 'raising analysis' where a constituent that belongs logically to the
complement clause is said to be raised to the object of the matrix clause.
This is a possible analysis since Abun clauses are unmarked to show any type of
constituent marking. However, on structural grounds, this analysis is not preferred.
Firstly, with both predicate types involved, the entire clause which functions as the object
can be replaced by a single noun phrase which can operate as the object. For example:
1 0.67An kidoankra3so say COM 3soanbari-wasujimarry with I sosare-wojilike. this-but I soreonot.want-TRS 3so PERF
She said that she would marry me but I did not want her.
1 0.68Kapreanbari-waRahel biaiwergatan.although 3so not.want-TRS Rahel poss father persuade 3so
Although she did not want (to come) Rahel's father persuaded her.
It could be said that if only a single noun phrase can constitute the direct object, as in the
above examples, this would confirm the analysis that only a part of the embedded clause
functions as the direct object. However these sentences show that for Abun sentence
structure only a single constituent division follows the predicate. This single division consists
of the direct object. There is a single division only, rather than two constituent divisions
following the predicate as is posited by the alternative analysis. If it is assumed that there are
two constituents which follow the predicate in these cases--one a direct object and the other a
truncated clause-we are left with determining the constituent status of these truncated
clauses. In some languages like English, it is possible to have reduced subordinate clauses
which have no overt subject as in the following: ' Having eaten the hamburger, he got on with
the rest of his work' . However Abun does not appear to have subjectless subordinate
clauses. If example 1 0.66 is considered again,men mu ki.
suk-du
fear-TRs I pL go
say NOM-say
We are not afraid to go and tell this story.
Men yo
I pL NEGnyu-ware
thisnde.
NEGwhat is the status of mu ki sukdu re? Subjectless constituents like this do not exist elsewhere
in the language. There are occasions when a subject may be omitted. Sometimes in narratives
where the subject is the same or a number of events is given in quick succession, the subject
may be omitted.","[194, 195]"
"3.3. 1 . 1 THE GRAMMATICALISATION OFml
One of the suffixes that is an inflection on verbs or derives verbs from nouns is -wa. This
suffix has resulted from the lexical fonn , wa ' BENEFACTIVE' , uncergoing gramrnaticalisation.
Frequently the free-form wa is separated from the verb as in example 3.2. It is common
also for wa to be adjacent to the verb, and in these cases coalescence results in a semantic
shift as well as a change in prosody. This occurs because the object is frequently omitted in
Abun grammar, leaving the verb adjacent to wa. The preposition does not coalesce in all
cases, but particularly when the interpretation of the verb and wa is no longer compositional,
it is clear that wa has become the suffix -wa. According to Anderson ( 1 985:42), the inflected
verb, once formed, is then like all words, subject to shift, specialisation, generalisation and
other changes of meaning. The inflected form is seen in example 3.3 as well as in example3 .4.

phrases. In the case of noun phrases the form is:

There is no distinction in meaning between the use of this particle and simple
juxtaposition. Therefore examples are found in sentences, prepositional phrases and noun
phrases similar to those examples given above. In all cases e may be added between the noun
phrases, but may not be added for verb phrases. This particle is widely used and conjoins
phrases in subject or object positions in Abun sentences, as in examples 5 . 1 73 and 5 . 1 74CHAPTER 596respectively. Topicalised objects may also include complex phrases conjoined by e , as in
example 5 . 1 75 .

noun phrase, is followed by an embedded clause. Embedded clauses of this nature, when
negated, do not use the secondary negative particle yo since it has been replaced by kadit.
This happens even though they may be of the sentence type that nonnally requires both
negative particles.
A further clarification of negation in subordinate clauses is necessary in the case where a
relative clause in the object position is negated as well as the whole sentence. In such a case
only one nde is required, as in example 8 .30a. This particle fonns the bracket for both the
subordinate clause and the sentence. There are two occurrences of yo in 8.30a, whereas in
8.30b only the relative clause is negated, while in 8.30c the whole sentence is negated.

Prepositional phrases consist of a noun phrase preceded by a preposition. Prepositional
phrases fill dative, locative, instrumental and other adjunct positions in the sentence. Table 5.4
is a list of the prepositions used in Abun with their English equivalent, and categorised into
four different general types. This is Table 3.7 repeated here for convenience.
A general feature of prepositional phrases that will be illustrated below is the possibility of
ellipsis of the head of the phrase, leaving the preposition stand alone. In such cases the head
is readily recoverable from the context.",[94]
"COMPLEMENT CLAUSES17110.2.3 NOUN COMPLEMENTATION
The previous discussion listed the various predicate types which may take complements
in Abun. Some nouns may take complements also and where this is the case the
complementiser do i s used. Noun complementation is limited to two types: describing
names and describing thoughts.","[182, 183]"
"75PHRASE STRUCTURE5.2.3 POST-DETERMINER NOUN PHRASE MODIFIERS
There are other ways to modify a noun phrase apart from using the modifiers discussed
above. Phrases or clauses may be added to a noun phrase by the use of to NOUN MODIFYlNG
PARTICLE, or by the juxtaposition of locative prepositional phrases (in order to modify the head
of the noun phrase in regard to its location). A special case, sino 'all together' , is also
discussed at the end of this section.
In these instances an Abun noun phrase consists of:
HEAD (MODIFlERS) (DETERMINER) (MODIFIERS)
Usually only one modifier fol lows the determiner, but more than one is possible as in
example 5 .68 below.
The noun modifying particle (NMP) introduces a phrase or clause which modifies the head
of a noun phrase. Phrases and clauses introduced by NMP are added to the noun phrase and
modify it. Consider the following example:
5.56Wo suk-fo
to
but thing-taboo NMPndam
birdsyor
cassowaryne
DEryo,
then.1RRnu-we
2PL-twogit nde.
eat NEG
B ut the cassowary is taboo, you must not eat it.
The phrase 'the cassowary ' , introduced by the NMP, modifies the forbidden thing. Again in
example 5.57 below, the noun banbo ' mountain' is modified by the addition of the phrase
'the Waibe' .
5.57M e n gwa b e i yamo banbo
to
Waibe n e d e rut.
I PL beat sago at
mountain NMP Waibe DEr side far
We beat the sago on the mountain, that is on Waibe mountain on the far side.","[86, 87]"
"Erensi deceive child DEf go
Erensi deceived the child into going (away).
It appears that only a small number of predicates may behave this way, exhibiting two
distinct structural possibilities. As the above examples illustrate, there appear to be certain
restrictions which limit the number of predicates capable of doing this. One restriction limits
predicates to those that are transitive. Any intransitive verb can occur only with the
complementiser present. The second restriction appears to be one of co-referentiality. Givan
( 1 993: 1 5) describes the sharing of referents across contiguous clauses and tenns this
'referential continuity' . In describing co-reference limitations for English complement
clauses he notes ( 1 993 : 1 6) that ""The subject of the complement of a modality verb must be
co-referential with the subject of the main verb and the subject of the complement of a
manipulative verb must be co-referential with the object of the main verb"" [italics his]. In
Abun, co-reference restrictions also apply but are somewhat different to those which Givan
has described for English. In Abun, if these predicates can take both an object and
complement constituent then there needs to be agreement between the object and the
complement constituent. In three of the above examples, 1 0.73, 1 0.75 and 1 0.77, the object
of the predicate is co-referential with the subject of the complement clause. In all of these
cases the subject of the complement clause is replaced by a pronoun which agrees in number
and person with the object of the matrix clause. However, example 1 0.79 shows a pretence
predicate which varies in that the subject of the complement clause agrees with the subject of
the main clause predicate. Here again a pronoun is used to indicate agreement. The means of
pronominal reference to the subject of the complement clause is typical of all cases where
these two constituents are co-referential. Unlike English, where only in manipulative
predicates does the object of the predicate agree with the subject of the complement, as
shown in Table 10. 1 , this restriction is shared by other predicate types. 29 Therefore it appears
that if a particular predicate can take complements both with and without a complementiser
then co-reference restrictions operate.
10.4.4 KNOWLEDGE PREDICATES
The predicate jam 'knowlhear/understand' also may be considered a Type 3 predicate in
that it may occur with or without a complementiser. However, this verb is structurally
different in that it does not have an object immediately preceding the complement clause
constituent, as is the case with the other Type 3 predicates. If jam has the meaning 'know ' it
is more likely to use the complementiser in conjunction with the complement clause. If jam29In particular predicates such as 'know' , 'lie' and 'call' which Giv6n terms 'Perception-Cognition­
Utterance' predicates 'no co-reference with any argument in the main clause' is required in English
(Giv6n 1 993: 1 6).",[200]

DEfAmong the adjectives which modify the head of a noun phrase, syntactically only one
class can be distinguished, because only one adjective can modify a noun head in a noun
phrase. The modification of a noun by more than one adjective requires the use of other
constructions which are discussed in §5.2. 1 .
In the corpus of data to hand a total of 3 8 adjectives has been distinguished, but there may
well be others, thus it is included as an open word class. Semantically, distinctions can be
made to form groups of colour, size, quality or age adjectives, but syntactically they all
function in the same way.
There is one adjective compound formed by two adjectives, [ADJ-ADJ] Adj' wok-gan 'small­little: young and smal l ' .
3.3.4 ADVERBSThe class of adverbs, which function as modifiers of constituents other than nouns
(Schachter 1 985:20), is a heterogeneous group in Abun consisting of several subclasses,
'directional ' adverbs, 'time' adverbs, 'manner' adverbs and 'degree' adverbs. Directional and
degree adverb subclasses are closed, and the number of manner adverbs is limited. Time
adverbs have more flexibility with some compounding evident.",[48]
"Men yorende.thisNEGrende.thisNEGFor these two examples, given originally as 10.53 and 10.58 respectively, the entire
complement clause (underlined) is considered to be the object of the complement-taking
predicates. Thus the object of wergat 'force' in 1 0.65 is yewis yi ben suk re 'other tribes do
these things' and in 1 0.66 the object of the verb nyuwa 'be afraid of' is men mu ki sukdu re
'we go and tell this story' . This analysis is in keeping with the type of constituent division
found in traditional transformational grammar and similar to that found in the more recent
version of this theory known as 'Government and Binding' .2 6
However, it could be posited that the entire embedded clause is not the object of the
complement-taking verbs but rather a single noun phrase only, namely yewis yi 'other
tribes' in example 1 0.65 and men 'we' in 1 0.66. This type of constituent division poses a
few problems. Because Abun has no case marking to put a noun like men into the
accusative, it cannot be seen whether this noun has been marked to show it is in the object26See, for example, the tree diagrams for sentences where the main clause verb is 'wish' in Jacobsen
( 1 986:40, 1 1 3, 1 1 8). The diagrams on pp. 1 1 3 and 1 1 8 show the tree structure in the light of
'principles of Government and B inding' and so is a more recent analysis. The entire clause i s
handled a s a single constituent S under a higher V P node.",[194]
"The last variant of sane is sane analo. This will be discussed in the following section.1 2.6 analo 'CAUSATIVE' CONJUNCfION
In the previous section two conjunctions were described which primarily filled another
category in Abun grammar besides that of 'conjunction ' . Kap-re is a temporal phrase
meaning 'this time ' . Sane is an adverbial meaning ' like that' or 'in that way ' . For both these
forms the influence of the national language has affected the sentence structures in which
they are used as conj unctions. There is one other Abun word -analo- which is used as a
conjunction, but this word is primarily used as another part of speech. Unlike kapre and
sane, this word, anato shows no influence from Indonesian in the way that it is used. Anato
is primarily a noun modifier with the meaning of 'focus' . It is also used as a conjunction to
link clauses together. Therefore this word fills two categories in Abun grammar. Anato does
not fit into any other type of conj unction described so far, so it is discussed separately to
other conjunctions.
The word ana-to consists of two morphemes ana 'FOCUS' and to 'NMP' . 4 5 Anato
frequently modifies a noun phrase to bring this noun phrase into focus, j ust like a cleft
construction does in languages that are capable of cleft constructions. Since Abun does not
possess a copula the type of cleft constructions found in English are not possible. Neither are
passive constructions possible in Abun . However, the semantic possibilities engendered by
both the passive and cleft constructions are handled in Abun by means of de-focus and focus
respectively. A noun phrase may be brought into focus by means of anato. In this way
anato functions as a noun modifier, as shown in the examples below.

"1 0.2.3 . 1 COMPLEMENT-TAKING NOUNS: NAMING
In order to give a name for a place or a person, the complementiser always precedes the
name given. The noun head which takes the complement consists of an inalienable
possessive phrase of which the noun gum 'name' is a part. In these cases the complement
does not consist of a full clause but only the noun phrase describing the name.

"Apposition, where the two heads involved stand in a mutually attributive relationship (that
is, each head is at the same time an attribute of the other head), is a special case of this
unmarked type of coordination. Alternatively, when the heads are single nouns, as in
examples 5. 1 68 and 5 . 169, they may be analysed as a single noun phrase, as discussed in
§5.2. 1 above. Thus an apposition noun phrase in Abun has the structure of NP + NP. Two or
more noun phrases are j uxtaposed. For example:

awayHuddleston terms the English equivalent of this type of construction a 'fused relative'
construction to distinguish it from other types of relative clause. In English, a non-specific
referent is marked by some type of wh phrase, by means of whoever, what or where
(Huddleston 1 984:403). Givon ( 1 990:646) also finds these types of relative problematic
since they do not line up with his semantic definition of a restrictive relative clause, namely
""A relative clause codes a proposition one of whose participants is coreferential with the
head noun that is modified by that clause"". If the head noun is non-referential there cannot be
strict referential identity, since many of these relative constructions concern hypothetical or
unknown situations.
In Abun the fact that these are a different type of relative construction is grammatically
marked. Abun is a language in which it is important to mark the distinction between that
which is real and known and that which is hypothetical and unknown. Normally within the
noun phrase, if any information in a sentence is not given (that is already known), the
determiner yo 'indefinite, alan' is used in conj unction with the noun concerned. Therefore
Abun grammar marks the fact that nouns may refer to either actual or hypothetical entities.
When a noun represents the head of a relative clause, it is important in Abun to mark this
noun so that it can be interpreted as referring to some specific known referent or to some
hypothetical entity.
It was explained earlier that the relative conjunction was composed of two morphemes,
the particles ga and to. In §9.3 . 1 , the role of the particle ga was explained as serving to
identify or mark the head of the relative clause as a specific referential identity. In the types of
construction, described as 'indefinite relative clauses' , the noun of the head has no real world
semantic referent at the time of utterance. There may be a range of possible referents but none
that is specific or known. Therefore this noun cannot be modified by gao The simple solution
in Abun is that these nouns are modified only by the general subordinating particle to. Since
ga is absent it is obvious that these nouns have no specific referent and are therefore
interpreted as non-referential. In English the same constructions need the addition of 'any' or
'ever' to make this clear, as examples 9.50 and 9.5 1 indicate.","[171, 172]"

stillThe above examples are grammatically a single clause. In these cases anato always brings
into focus or topicalises the noun that it follows. However, anato plays another role in Abun
grammar. Anato may act as a conj unction to link two clauses together.",[234]
"Anato i s a compound of ana 'FOCUS' and to 'NOUN MODIFYING PARTICLE' . To usually
indicates that embedding will follow. Such embedding refers to and modifies the noun
preceding. In other words, to introduces more information about the preceding noun. So we64CHAPTER 4know that any noun followed by to is going to have some modification. In this case the
additional information conveyed by adding to to the noun is that of prominence, highlighting
or additional focus.","[75, 76]"
"It can be seen by comparing these Abun sentences that there is no distinct subordinate
marking on the verb of the first clause in example 1 1 .2a, which might distinguish this clause
as a subordinate clause; neither is there a subordinate conj unction equivalent to 'after' . Abun
or 'after' is an adverb which, in 1 1 .2a, compounds with the sequential conjunction ete 'and
then ' . Abun does not have an exact meaning equivalent for the English coordinate
conj unction ' and' . In fact the only difference between these two examples regarding
constituent structure is the addition of or 'after' to the conjunction ete in example 1 1 .2a. If
the conj unctions orete and ete were removed from these examples, all four remaining
clauses would be good, freestanding independent clauses in Abun.
Therefore it appears that in common with languages of the clause-chaining type, Abun
lacks an obvious subordinate/coordinate distinction as found in Indo-European languages.
Many of the clause-chaining languages of the world are found on the island of New Guinea.
In a clause-chaining language (Longacre 1985:264)
There is a clause (characteristically final in a chain of clauses) that has a verb of
distinctive structure that occurs but once in the entire chain while other (typically
non-final) clauses have verbs of different structure . . .Each non-final clause is
marked so as to indicate whether the fol lowing clause has same subject or
different subject from itself.
An example from a clause-chaining language, Kanite of Papua New Guinea, is given
below. Because of its length, it has been abbreviated from the original example given in
Longacre ( 1 985 :266).
(1)his-u 'a-ke- 'ka

stand on its own because the pronoun has been omitted. In the Abun translation given later, this i s

In all these examples, although they represent relativisations of a direct object, the
determiner has not been used. The word order is sufficient to locate the gap, created by the
omission of the head, since prepositional phrases must always follow a direct object. In these
cases the gap is not clause-final and there is no need to indicate the boundary of the restricting
clause. Therefore, whenever there is an adjunct or complement of some kind within the
structure of the restricting clause, the determiner does not need to be used. So a relativisation
of the direct object may have the following composition:HEAD+ gata +SUBJ+ VERB+GAP+DET
OR
+GAP+ADJUNCT/COMPLEMENT
+
+
HEAD+ gata SUBJ VERB
The same situation is evident when a non-direct object is being relativised. In example9.28 below, the preposition su 'with' indicates a prepositional phrase. The gap is indicated by
the presence of the preposition without the noun which normally accompanies it. Although
the gap here is clause-final it is part of the prepositional phrase. Part of the phrase is present,
so it is not necessary to use ne since there is another means through which the location of the
gap may be encoded.",[166]
"Ii
IsoPerhaps in these cases the clause that fol lows rna gata does not represent an adverbial
clause of reason because no conjunction which indicates reason, such as we 'because' , has
been used. Rather, an additional clause has been joined to the sentence by means of the
locative preposition rna in exactly the same way that a locative phrase would be joined to the
clause. In Abun, with predicates such as sa 'laugh' and maskwa 'be angry ' , additional
arguments may be required in the clause to indicate not the object of these predicates, but
rather the reason behind the action. If this reason is expressed as a full clause, the clause is
embedded in the main clause by the dual means of the locative preposition rna and the
relative conjunction gata. 1 6
I n these types of example we find that gata i s used i n clauses that could not be described
as restrictive relative clauses. Wherever sa gata and rna gata are used they appear to join
clauses rather than modify a head. In these cases the clauses that follow gata are full clauses.
There is no gap in these clauses because they are not relative clauses. It was discussed earlier
that gata was a relative conjunction rather than a relative marker (§9.3.3). It seems then that
in its function as a conjunction gata may join subordinate clauses to larger structures, even
though these are not relative clauses and are adverbial in meaning.9.7 lNDEFlNITE RELATNE CLAUSES
In the previous section clauses that departed from the standard relative clause type were
discussed. In this section another type of relative clause, the 'indefinite' relative clause, will
be shown to differ from the 'standard' restrictive relative clause. These types of clause, due to
the non-referential nature of the head, we have termed 'indefinite relative clauses' to
distinguish them from relative clauses of the regular variety. Structurally they differ from
regular relative clauses in that only the noun-modifying particle ta is used, rather than the16The concept of prepositions which behave as conjunctions will be developed further in Chapter 12.",[171]
"Other nouns may modify the head of a noun phrase. Thjs type of construction is usually
referred to as a complex noun phrase, but since the addition of another noun following the
head modifies the head analogous to other modifiers, we have chosen to discuss it as a
modifier. Examples of this type are:
5.17nggwejamsemgarden cassava

5.18ne
DETtohambresakeastern.cloth toba CL
three lengths of toba clothgri
threeThe use of adjectival phrases as modifiers of the heads of noun phrases is by far the
most common type of modification. In most cases an adjectival phrase is realised by a single
adjective only, such as colour as in example 5 . 19, size 5.20, and quality 5 .2 1 . This type of
modification follows any other nouns that modify the head of the noun phrase. For more
complex examples of adjectival phrases see §5.5.

DETQuantifier phrases may have either a general quantifier, an ordinal numeral or a cardinal
numeral as its head, and is preceded by an optional classifier when the head is a general
quantifier or an ordinal numeral, and an obligatory classifier when the head is a cardinal
numeral. See §5.6 for a discussion of quantifier phrases. Some examples are:CHAPTER 570(ge) m wa rna.

"As stated above, objects are frequently omitted in Abun, resulting in the preposition ke t
being adjacent to a verb. This has resulted in the combining of some verbs with ket with a
subsequent semantic shift. The free form ket occurs adjacent to the verbs mu 'go ' , ti 'stand' ,
tot 'cut ' , and e 'fall over' , but there is no evidence of semantic shift or change of prosody in
these cases, so ket remains as a free form and is not affixed to these verbs. However, ket has
become a suffix in the case of the two adjectives mbrin 'unconscious' in example 3.22 and
ye 'difficult' in example 3.23. This is clear because of both prosody and significant meaning
changes in these two examples. Another example of a change of meaning is the suffixation
of -ket with the verb ki 'say ' . The resultant word is ki-ket 'slander' .

cases they do not make use of any conjunction. The two clauses are juxtaposed and a mood
particle after the final clause is understood to apply to both clauses.
One exception is su-bere 'so that'. In this word the preposition su 'with' compounds with the time
word bere 'later' to form a conjunction. Most conjunctions do not compound with time words as is
the case here, the only exception being onde-ber 'otherwise.will' which will be discussed later.",[223]
"When clauses are linked by compounding conjunctions they cannot be embedded, as i s
the case when clauses are linked b y prepositions. I n these cases each clause must be marked
for negation and for mood, if this is applicable. Each clause could stand as an independent
clause. Therefore the sentence which uses a compounding conj unction as the means of clause
linkage is structurally different to those which use prepositions. The following examples
indicate the mood and negative marking of clauses linked by these conjunctions. 39

In a language like English, adverbial subordinate clauses can be distinguished from
coordinate clauses in that the subordinate clause is not fixed in its position within the
sentence. The subordinate clause may be either pre-posed, that is sentence-initial, or post­
posed, that is sentence-final. Such flexibility of sentence position is not possible in Abun.
Therefore in Abun, the ability to pre-pose or post-pose an adverbial clause is not an indicator
of subordination. As has already been discussed earlier (§ 1O.3. 1 . 1 ) , there is no non-finite
verb form that can be used to signify that a clause is subordinate. However, the placement of
the final negative particle is an indicator in Abun that a clause is embedded within a larger
sentence. By this means clauses that are linked to larger clauses by prepositions can be
shown to be subordinate, as in examples 1 2.5 and 12.6 above. However, prepositions and all
conjunctions in Abun are sentence-medial. A clause together with its linking conjunction
cannot be fronted or pre-posed as is possible in a language like English. It has been claimed
(Givon 1 990: 844) that ""All languages seem to allow the pre-posing of ADv-clauses"". This is
not the case for Abun and therefore this cannot be used as an indicator of subordination.",[219]
"Cardinal numerals may also be head of a quantifier phrase. Classifiers, however, are
obligatory when a cardinal numeral is used, except for a few common cases such as an (ge)
we 'they two ' , where the classifiers are sometimes elided due to common usage. Some
examples of the use of cardinal numbers are seen in examples 5 . 1 59 to 5 . 1 62 below.

four5.7 COMPLEX PHRASES
Complex phrases consist of two basic types, coordination and apposition.
Regarding the first of these, coordination, all languages possess strategies that permit
various types of coordination to occur at the phrasal and sentential level, thereby forming
complex phrases and sentences. According to Payne ( 1 985a:3), there are ""five basic co­
ordination types which are realised linguistically both at phrasal and sentential levels:
conj unction (p and q), postsection (p and not q), presection (not p and q), disjunction (p or q)
and rejection (not p and not q; not p or q)"".
Payne ( 1 985a:3) claims that most languages treat postsection, presection and rejection
analytically as a combination of conjunction and negation, or disj unction and negation; that is,CHAPTER 594there is no distinct synthetic form. Abun also treats these three types of coordination
analytically. Therefore only conjunction and disjunction are distinct categories in Abun.
The second basic type of complex phrase is that of apposition. Since this is structurally the
same as one type of coordination (simple juxtaposition), it will be discussed under that
section.
Table 5.5 following summarises each complex noun phrase type and structure that will be
discussed below.","[105, 106]"
