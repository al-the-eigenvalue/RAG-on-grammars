"LW/M276Passamaquoddy-MaliseetIn addition, an animate noun or demonstrative pronoun is obligatorily marked as
either central to the discourse or ""distanced"" from the speaker's focus (Section 2.3).
An inanimate noun cannot be the indirect object of a transitive verb (Section 4.3.3).
Those learning the language will need to hear words used in context in order to tell
whether they are animate or inanimate. There are two quick ways for a beginner to
distinguish the gender of a noun or pronoun heard in speech. The first is to listen for
the plural form, which ends in -kif the noun is animate, -1 if it is inanimate. The second is to listen for the verb used with the noun: in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet (as in
the other Algonquian languages), the stems and inflections of the verbs used with
animate nouns and pronouns differ from those of the verbs used with inanimates.nit el·taqs·it psuw·is 'that is how a cat sounds' (animate)
that thus-sound.Al-3.sg.ChC bobcat-dim(=housecat)nit el·taq·ahk suw·ahq·ihikon 'that is how a bell sounds' (inanimate)

[1)-hear.TA-dir:3.1nd catLW/M277Passamaquoddy-Maliseet'nearby') or obviative ('distanced'). It is helpful to think of these categories in spatial
terms because they are used by speakers to distinguish- grammatically- between
what is the focus of attention and what is more remote from consideration. Two animate nouns or pronouns can occupy the same grammatical ""space"" at the same time
only when they are conjoined - 'Mary and Peter will be there', 'I saw a dog or a
wolf', 'She and they are cousins'- or when one of them is locative- 'John is at
Mary's', 'the milk is in the bottle.'
In all other cases when two animate nouns or pronouns (except 1', 'we', 'you') occur
in the same clause, one of them will be proximate (the focus of attention) and the
other will be obviative. Obviation also operates at the level of extended discourse, for
example in storytelling, where a storyteller may indicate shifts in focus by changing a
character from obviative to proximate, or vice-versa. Because proximate and obviative are complementary categories, the obviative is sometimes referred to as the
""fourth person"".
There are two common situations in which the obviative occurs: when one noun is
the subject of a verb and the other is the object (Section 2.3.1) and when an animate
noun is possessed by (belongs to) 'him', 'her', or 'them' (Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3).

Passamaquoddy-Maliseet makes certain distinctions with regard to person that are
different from those made in European languages. As shown in Table I, the two
meanings of 'we' are distinguished, while one word means 'he or she'.

"2.2. Animate and Inanimate
A second characteristic of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet is that all nouns and pronouns
are either animate or inanimate, a feature identical to grammatical gender. As in the
case of masculine and feminine in other languages, the gender of a noun in
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet may not correspond to the natural animateness or inanimateness of the referent- at least, not in the perception of a non-speaker. It is difficult for people learning the language to predict the gender of a noun.
Abstract nouns, those which do not refer to something concrete, are invariably inanimate: prayer, the past, happiness, footstep are examples. People, including 'soul'
and nouns which denote personal roles or occupations, are animate, as are all animals and trees. Beyond this there is only one extensive set of objects - containers
used for liquid (cup, spoon, pen, bathtub, etc.) - that is predictably animate. Some
plants, fruits, and vegetables are animate, but not all. The same is true for articles of
clothing. Some parts of the body are animate, but not necessarily those one might
expect; fingernail and knee are animate, but heart and tongue are inanimate. Many
other nouns, such as rope, fallen snow, star, milk, and playing-card suits, are
animate. A few nouns have different meanings according to gender: opos 'stick'
(inanimate), opos 'tree' (animate). Speakers will agree on the gender of newly created
words or words borrowed from other languages; they ""know"", for example, that a
tape-recorder is inanimate and that the tape in the cassette is animate.4 It is important
to remember, however, that, although they have a certain reality for speakers of
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, the designations animate and inanimate were originally
coined by linguists who were not native speakers of the language.
The gender distinction is all-pervasive in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet and the other
Algonquian languages. Animate and inanimate nouns have different inflections, and
the shape of verb stems and inflections depends upon the genders of actor and goal.
4Speakers asked by the author to use these English words in a Passamaquoddy-Maliseet
sentence uniformly ""assigned"" them the genders reported here. Still, there are a few differences between Passamaquoddy and Maliseet; for example, in Maliseet sukolis 'candy' is animate (speakers think of it like pokuwis 'chewing gum'), but in Passamaquoddy it is inanimate
(as is sukol 'sugar', from French sucre).",[6]
"A preverb is obligatory with most ta and ti finals. The most ""general"" preverb is oli'thus; to there', prefixed form -toli- (with t-insertion), changed form eli-. Another preverb has similar forms, -otoli- (progressive), unprefixed form toli-, prefixed form
-totoli-, changed form etoli. In both cases, the prefixed form may be reanalysed as an
unprefixed form: toli- 'thus; to there' and totoli- (progressive). This results in two pos36In the case of this word, -ikotohom(o)- is a stem which does not ""accept"" the attachment ofpreverbs. Since all preverbs end with a vowel (-i, -e, or -a) in their full forms and all stems of
this type begin with a vowel (/l-, e-, i-, or u-), there is an audible break between preverb and
verb stem, where both vowels are preserved. (See also the note in Section 3.4.1.)LW/M2749Passamaquoddy-Maliseetsible unprefixed forms, such as oli qasku, toli qasku 's/he runs thus; runs to there'; toli
qasku, totoli qasku 's/he is running'. Prefixed examples are ntoli qasq 'I run thus, I run
to there, I am running' and ntotoli qasq 'I am running'.
There are no true adjectives in Passamaquoddy-Malis eet; instead, preverbs, prenouns. or other initial roots carry such meanings: wisawi- 'yellow', as in wisawahq
'brass' . 'Yellow chair' would be translated using a verb: wisaweyik qotoput 'chair
which is yellow'.
For most preverbs there exists a corresponding particle (Section 4.8) with an identical
or closely related meaning. For example, the preverb 'ci- 'from' corresponds to the
particle 'ciw, which is used like a preposition- 'ciw imiyewikuwamok 'from or concerning the church', 'ciw luhkewakon 'about work'. The preverb /ami- 'within, underneath' corresponds to lamiw- wolopote lamiw 'it is warm inside'; lamiw tuwihputik
'under the table'. Sometimes the meaning of a particle is less directly connected to
that of the preverb: tuci- 'passing by; to such an extent' (changed form etuci 'very',
Section 4.4.2) corresponds to tuciw 'moreover, besides; right away'.",[28]
"Kilpskuk 'in Cobscook Bay, Maine' - kapsq 'waterfall' (in this case, tidal falls)
Pilick 'in Kingsclear, New Brunswick' - Pilic 'village' (English loan-word)

red-river.II-O.sg.ChCLW/M2729Passamaguoddy-Maliseet4.1.8. Diminutive and Feminine Suffixes
Diminutive nouns use a diminutive suffix, variously -_hsis, -sis, -is, -ossis- for example, mahtoqehsis 'little hare', skitapehsis 'little man', khakonossis 'little door', pilasqis or
pilaskuhsis 'piece of paper', pileyahsis 'new little one, baby'. The diminutive endings
may be combined and reduplicated to indicate that something or someone is even
tinier or cuter: was 'child' (archaic); diminutives: wasis 'child', wasossis, wasisossis, wasisossisossis, etc.",[18]

55This group of languages - called Eastern Algonquian- forms a sub-family of the
Algonquian languages, which at the time of European contact were spoken on the
Atlantic coast from Labrador to the Carolinas, across Quebec, Ontario, and the
Prairie provinces to the Rocky Mountains, and southward into the Mississippi River
drainage. The most widely spoken Algonquian language is Cree; others include
Ojibwa, Potawatomi, Blackfoot, and Montagnais.
1.1. An Endangered Language
There are approximately 500 fluent speakers of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, those in
Maine living principally in the two Passamaquoddy communities at Pleasant Point,
near Eastport, and Indian Township, near Princeton, with an additional small number in the Houlton Band of Maliseets. In New Brunswick, Maliseet is no longer heard
at St.-Basile, near Edmundston, but there are speakers at Tobique, Woodstock,
Kingsclear, St. Mary's, and Oromocto. There are no speakers among the Maliseets of
Quebec.
Those who speak the language today are almost without exception forty years of age
or older; few if any children speak Passamaquoddy-Maliseet as a first language. In
the communities, the speakers considered truly ""fluent"" are usually those in their
late fifties and older. By the Passamaquoddy tribe's own count, there are about 55
fluent speakers at Pleasant Point, and somewhat fewer at Indian Township
(Nicholas, 1995). The most recent Canadian census data identify 355 Maliseet-LW/M272Passarnaquoddy-Maliseetspeakers in New Brunswick, with some 40 living elsewhere in Canada (Statistics
Canada, 1992).
In the early years after contact, Europeans heard the Native languages of the regionevery day. They borrowed words from Eastern Algonquian languages to expand
their own vocabularies - toboggan ('tapakon in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet), sachem
(sakom 'chief'), wigwam (wikuwam), tomahawk (tomhikon), and many others. Native
speakers borrowed in tum, at first from French (lahkap 'cellar', from Ia cave; tehpisewey
'black pepper', from d'epices; muhsilepehk 'bishop', from monsieur /'eveque; piles 'spade'
[in cards], from pique) and later from English (piks 'pig'; leptanet 'lieutenant';
polecomon 'Frenchman'; kincemoss 'king', from King fames).
Until the middle years of this century Passamaquoddy-Maliseet remained vital, productive and widely spoken, and storytellers born in the 1930s and earlier maintain
the eloquence of the oral tradition today. At the time of the 1981 census, in eastern
Canada overall, indigenous language maintenance was lowest among those speakers
between 35 and 44 years of age (Burnaby & Beaujot, 1986); i.e., those who were young
children during and just after World War II.
Several factors have contributed to the gradual decline in the use of PassamaquoddyMaliseet. Changes in the education system - especially the establishment of the
residential schools in Canada, and later the integration of Native students into
provincial and state schools - put children in environments where they did not
speak their mother tongue or, in the worst cases, were severely punished for doing
so. Teachers, moreover, routinely encouraged parents to speak to their children in
English so that they might do better in school. With the new mobility that accompanied World War II came increased intermarriage and lopsided cultural interchange
-sports leagues, television, higher education- between non-Native and Native
communities. English began to displace Passamaquoddy-Maliseet as the language of
the home and community.
What is being lost? Passamaquoddy-Maliseet reveals a ""way of knowing"" markedly
different from that expressed in English or French. It structures physical and social
environments not with absolutes, but in relative terms dependent upon speakers'
particular points of view and their participation (Leavitt, 1995). For example, speakers normally locate objects and events in relation to themselves and the people they
are speaking with - Maliseet e/om·askut·ek (hence-field.II-O.sg.ChC)l 'where a field
extends away from here' or weckuw·askut·ek (hither-field.II-O.sg.ChC) 'where a field
extends toward here'. People do not ordinarily speak of the environment without
situating themselves within it; they are an integral part of the world they live in (see
also Section 2.5). The language thus reveals ways in which personal identity is dynamic, described, perhaps even determined (cf. Wenzel & Stairs, 1992), according to
changing relations with the world and with family and community.","[4, 5]"
"Passamaquoddy-Maliseet is an eastern Algonquian language, with about
500 speakers today in Maine (USA) and New Brunswick (Canada). This sketch
outlines the fundamental features of the language. Passamaquoddy-Maliseet has
five vowel sounds and twelve consonants, with pitch and stress also distinctive.
Words are composed of roots; a typical verb, for example, contains verbal,
nominal, adjectival, and adverbial roots, as well as number, tense, and other
grammatical markings. The sterns and inflections of transitive verbs are
differentiated by grammatical gender, animate or inanimate, according to that
of the direct object, while intransitive verbs agree in gender with the subject.
Other words include nouns, pronouns and uninflected particles. Particular
features of the language include the regular syncope of syllables containing
unstressed schwa, the use of absentative forms of nouns and verbs, the division
of third persons into two grammatical categories to indicate narrative focus, the
reanalysis of many participles as nouns, the marking of intransitive verbs for
use with direct objects, and speaker-centred construction of space and time.
Robert M. Leavitt directs the Micmac-Maliseet Institute at the University of New
Brunswick, in Fredericton (Canada), where he is a professor in the Faculty of
Education. Since 1971, he has worked closely with speakers of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet
on linguistic and literary studies, educational materials, and curriculum for secondlanguage instruction. He is currently working with David A. Francis, a Passamaquoddy
elder, and a number of other Passamaquoddy and Maliseet consultants on an expanded
dictionary of the language. His most recent book, Maliseet &: Micmac: First Nations of
the Maritimes (1995), is used in Native Studies courses in Atlantic Canada.",[1]

51Passamaquoddy-Maliseet is the language of the Native people of the St. Croix and St.
John River valleys, in the region along the border between the state of Maine, USA,
and the province of New Brunswick, Canada. Passamaquoddy and Maliseet are dialects of a single language; they differ slightly only in ""accent"" and usage, much like
American and Canadian English. In general, the language is called Passamaquoddy
in the St. Croix valley (the easternmost part of Maine), and Maliseet in the St. John
valley (western New Brunswick and northern Maine). There is also a band of
Maliseets in the Gaspe region of Quebec, with two small reserves situated near
Riviere-du-Loup, but almost all members of this band live elsewhere in the province.","[3, 4]"
"The stem of the verb 'tome (wtome) 's/he smokes' is -wotom-. When a verb whose stem
begins with -wo- takes a personal prefix, this -wo- changes to -u-: nutom 'I smoke' and
kutom 'you (kil) smoke'. The form 'tome (wtome) does not have a personal prefix, but
in third person forms which do take a personal prefix~ such as utoman '[and then)
s/he smokes', the resulting wu- (from w- + -wo-) is realized as u-.
A common preverb whose stem begins with -wo- is woli- 'good'. In stems beginning
with -wol- and -won-, the o is maintained when there is no personal prefix, but the
-wo- still changes to -u- following a personal prefix.woli·tahas·u 's/he is happy'; wolitahas·it 'if s/he is happy' (no personal prefix)

n·ulitahas 'I am happy'; nit·te na [w]·ulitahas·in 'and then s/he is happy' (pers. prefix)
1-be.happy.AI - then-emph also [3)-be.happy.AI-3.sg.Sub
compare 'tom·at (wtom·at) (-3.sg.UnC) 'if s/he smokes' (no personal prefix)13The full form of the stem is -kotomakey(i)-, where i is the stem vowel. This vowel determines
the shape of inflectional endings (Section 4); for simplicity, it is omitted here and in the following examples.
14Younger speakers may appear to ""violate"" this rule. One hears, for example, such forms as
npsqihtuhus 'I shave (myself)' instead of nposqihtuhus. (Actually, most younger speakers omit
the n-, too. They may no longer be aware of the first syllable in the underlying stem- in this
case -posqihtuhus- -as can be seen from the fact that they also omit the e in the ""changed""
stem pesqihtuhus- [Section 3.4.3), saying psqihtuhusit 'when he shaved', instead of
pesqihtuhusit.)LW/M2718Passamaquoddy-MaliseetThe stem of the verb 'tawewestu (ntawewestu) 's/he knows how to speak' is
-nihtawewest-. In this verb the i in the first syllabJelS drops out in the absence of a personal prefix, but it is retained in prefixed forms such as knihtawewest 'you (kil) know
how to speak'.
Other verb stems undergo changes more complex than those described above. The
stem of [w]·nokka ·ht·un (3-to.completion-do.to.TI-Sub/Ind ) 's/he eats all of it' is
-nokihkaht-. Here the vowel is dropped from either the first or the second syllable, depending upon whether a personal prefix is used. There is no form in which both
vowels are maintained.k·nokkahtun 'you (kif) eat all of it'; 'kihkaht! (nkihkaht) '(kil) eat all of it!'
Another verb of this type is 'pottehmon (wpottehmon) 's/he hits it accidentally', whose
stem is -pocihtehm-. When the second vowel drops out, the c reverts tot. This alternation is common in many Passamaquoddy-Maliseet words (compare ehpit 'woman',
ehpicik 'women').npottehmon 'I hit it accidentally'; pcihtehman 'if I hit it accidentally'
The stem -wotahsom- 'feed another from something' combines the features of stems
beginning with -wa- and those having two syllables subject to syncope.ut·som·a·l [w]·nican·ol emqan·sis·ok 's/he feeds h/h child from a little spoon'
originating.from-feed.TA-dir:3.Ind-obv.sg [3]-child.dep-obv.sg spoon-dim-Joe
'tahsomat ... 'if she feeds .. .'; wetsomat .. . 'when she fed .. .'
Syncope occurs in some nouns: qotoput (also pronounced kutoput) 'chair', nt·oqtoput
(1-) 'my chair'. Here the stem is -oqotoput-. (The first tin ntoqtoput is inserted following the personal prefix before stems beginning with a voweJ16; compare the similar
prevocalic t used in French: a-t-il.)
The examples in this section are by no means exhaustive, and the variety of shapes
which a single verb can take may seem astounding, if not confusing. The changes are
usually predictable, however, and once patterns like those described here are discovered, they can be applied to newly encountered verbs.","[12, 13]"
"2.6. In Surrunary: The Nature of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Words
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet words are composed of roots, each of which contributes
different information to the complete meaning, so that a single word may indeed
equate to an ""entire sentence"", as speakers are fond of saying. Nouns, pronouns, and
verbs are animate or inanimate in gender. First, second, and third person are ordered
according a hierarchy which places kil and kiluwaw 'you' at the top, so that marking
for 'you' takes precedence over marking for 'I', which in turn ranks higher than third
person. Third persons animates are divided into two grammatical categories:
proximate (the focus of attention), and obviative (backgrounded), which ranks lower
on the person hierarchy. Inanimate nouns occupy the lowest level.
In addition to verbal, adjectival, adverbial and even nominal meanings, the roots and
inflections of verbs encode grammatical information (Table IV). Gender, transitivity,
person, and hierarchical relationship have already been mentioned. These and the
remaining items in Table IV are discussed in detail in Section 4, with further
examples in Section 5.

LeSourd (1993a) and Sherwood (1986) provide full, detailed descriptions of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet phonology. This section summarizes some of the main features.oli·y·e uten·ek 's/he goes to town'
to.there-go.AI-3.sg.Ind town-loc
't·oloq·aph·a·l oloqi·w qospem·ok 'she tracked him toward the lake'
3-that. way-track.TA-dir:3.Ind-obv .sg that.way-particle lake-loc3.1. Vowel Sounds
There are five vowels in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet (Table V) . In most linguistic
studies the vowel represented by u in the standard orthography is written as o, and
the vowel o (schwa) is written as a.",[10]
"LW/M2727Passamaquoddy-Maliseettive)'. Similarly, ntehpitem 'my wife', more common among Maliseet speakers than
nisuwiyek.
The possessed stem of some nouns has an additional syllable at the beginning which
consists of the vowel a or ah; this syllable disappears without a trace, however, in
unprefixed forms. Thus nt·ah·tuwossomut 'my cup', from tuwossomut, and nt·ah·tap·im
'my bow (weapon)', from tap.

'their daughters''Tul and 'tusol are called dependent nouns because they exist only in possessed forms;
there is no unpossessed form •tul 'a boat' or •tus 'a daughter' (tus occurs as a term of
address only). This grammatical dependence is sometimes termed inalienable possession. Dependent nouns include all body parts and kinship terms, along with a small
set of other nouns denoting personal items- including 'tul and wik 'h/h house',
'topun 'h/h bed', 'temisol 'h/h dog', 'posumol 'h/h cat'. For each of these there is a corresponding non-dependent noun ordinarily not inflected for possession - oqiton
'canoe', wikuwam 'house', kuhut 'bed', olomuss 'dog', psuwis 'cat'. Wasis 'child' is the
non-dependent counterpart of nicanol 'h/h child'.
unacceptable to older (fluent) speakers: •pihtin 'a hand' (unpossessed),
•nwasis 'my child', ,.,tolomussol 'h/h dog' (possessed)
Most non-dependent nouns, but not all, have a special ""possessed stem"" formed by
inserting -_m- after the noun stem, where""_"" represents the stem vowel. This stem is
then inflected like an ordinary noun stem- for example, n·sakom·am·onu·k (1-chiefposs-l.pl-3.pl) 'our (nilun) chiefs', '·cipiyatku·m·ol ([3]-crucifix-poss-obv.sg) 'h/h crucifix', n·pilasku·m 'my paper'. Loan-words are almost always given this -_m- when inflected for possession, even if they are used as dependent nouns: n·polatal·om 'my
brother', n·sistal·om 'my sister'; but not n·tatat 'my dad'.
like verbs (see Section 3.4.2), nouns, too, have an underlying stem which is affected
by the addition of endings and personal prefixes. The stem of skitap 'man' is
-woskitape- (no apostrophe is written before the consonant cluster at the beginning of
skitap (wskitap]), and the ""possessed stem"" is -woskitapem-; thus n·uskitap·em 'my man,
my husband', k·uskitap·em·uwa·k 'your (kiluwaw) men', uskitap·em 'h/h men (obvia-Locative endings follow the pattern of plural, obviative, and possessed forms in making use of the stem vowel. All locatives, whether animate or inanimate, singular or
plural, end in-k. The singular ending is -_k, and the plural ending -ihkuk (for stem
vowel o or i) or -_wihkuk. These endings can be added to any noun, although one
suspects that locative abstract nouns - pom·aws·uwakon·ok (2-along-live-noun-loc) 'in
life' -are influenced by English, and replace an indefinite subject verb form such as
pem·aws·imk (along-live-indef.ChC) or qen·awsimk (while-) 'while living' (see also Section 4.8).wikuwamok 'in, on, at the house' wikuwamihkuk 'in, on, among the houses'
sqotewihkuk 'in the fires, where there are fires'
sqotek 'in the fire'
puskonikonihkuk 'in the coffins, in the graveyard'
puskonikonok 'in the coffin'
Possessed nouns can be marked locative, too. Typical forms are ntahtuwossomutik 'in
my cup', kpilaskumok 'on your (kif) paper', and 'tulihkuwak or 'tuluwawihkuk or even
'tuluwawihkuwak 'in their boats'. It is interesting to note how the endings -uwa and
-ihkuk are combined here, with -uwa- 'their' repeated in the last example, which
actually means 'each of them in h/h own boat'. Obviation is not marked in locative
forms: 'tahtuwossomut·ik 'in h/h cup'.
The locative forms of personal names end in _hk and mean 'at the home of'- Malihk
'at Mary's', Piyelk 'at Peter's' (with syncope); also, sakomahk 'at the chief's'; Sitansisk
'at Fredericton, NB'- i.e., 'at little St. Ann's'. Locative forms of nouns denoting animals and people are used only in the plural- ahahsuwihkuk 'where the horses are, in
the stable'; sistossuwihkuk26 'among the nuns, at the convent'. To say something like 'a
fly is on the horse' a different construction must be used, in which 'horse' (obviative)
is the direct object of the ordinarily intransitive verb 'sit on top' (see Section 4.3.2).amucalu '·tehsaq·op·in·ol ahahs·uwol'a fly is sitting on top of the horse'

"4. Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Words
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet has words of four types: nouns, including personal names,
place names, and participles used as nouns; pronouns, including personal, demonstrative, and interrogative forms and a ""hesitation"" pronoun; verbs, which are transitive or intransitive, and animate or inanimate; and particles, the only category of uninflected words, including cardinal numbers, conjunctions, and adverbs. Nouns and
pronouns are described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, below. Sections 4.3 through 4.7
describe verbs, with attention to how verb stems are composed from various types of
roots and how they are inflected. Finally, Section 4.8 describes particles. (For Passamaquoddy-Maliseet names of the parts of speech, see Leavitt & Francis, 1984.)23skitapiyik 'men'

stem vowel -estern vowel -i-In cipiyatkuk, note the syncope: -ahtoq- becomes -atq-, and then the -q- plus the plural
ending -ok becomes -kuk. In syncope, h before an obstruent drops along with the
following vowel.
The plural forms of inanimate nouns end with -1. This -1 is also preceded by various
combinations of vowels and glides according to the stem vowel of the noun.khakon 'door'

mahsus 'fiddlehead' (fern) mahsusiyil 'fiddleheads'stem vowel-astem vowel -astem vowel -ustem vowel -astem vowel -estern vowel -i-Personal names are animate nouns. Those which are distinctively PassamaquoddyMaliseet usually have French origins, even though they are now paired with English
names. Piyel and Mali derive from Pierre and Marie (r's obligatorily becoming/'s).
Other names include Lula Laurent/Lawrence, Teles Therese/Theresa, Aselihk Angelique/ Angela, and Ehtiyan Etienne/Stephen. Like all borrowings, these conform to
the phonology of the language, so that Louis becomes 6/uwi and not *Luwi, to accommodate Passamaquoddy-Maliseet syllable and stress patterns, and Franc;ois becomes
Polansuwe, not *Plansuwe, since words do not begin with consonant-/. Many current
surnames go back to christenings by French-speaking priests, including Sockabasin,
from Jacques-Vincent; Sopiel and Sappier, from St.-Pierre; Sabattis, from JeanBaptiste. Polchies, a common Maliseet surname, is derived from Paul, with the diminutive suffix -sis: 'little Paul, son of Paul'.
4.1.2. Participial Nouns4.1. Nouns
There are two types of nouns in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, ordinary substantives and
participial nouns- nouns which are really verb forms .
4.1.1. Animate and Inanimate Nouns
The plural forms of animate nouns end with -k. This -k is preceded by various combinations of vowels and glides according to the final vowel of the noun stem - the
""stem vowel"".cihkonaqc 'turtle'
cipiyahtoq 'crucifix'
mahtoqehs 'hare'
possesom 'star'

possesomuk 'stars'
sakomak 'chiefs'stem vowel -astem vowel -astem vowel -ustem vowel -ustem vowel -a-Many nouns are actually participles. In Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, participles are relative clauses consisting of Changed Conjunct forms (Section 4.4.2) of transitive or intransitive or intransitive verbs. Both animate and inanimate participle forms are used
as nouns; plural forms end in -ik (except obviative) and -il, respectively, which marks
the number of the subject or the object of the participle. Ordinary substantives do not
use these particular endings.nul·okehk·ikem·il 'teacher' (lit., 'who teaches')

Most speakers have reanalysed participial nouns as ordinary nouns and add prefixes
and endings accordingly, creating forms such as n·kelon ·osk (1-hold.TA2inv:3.sg.ChC) 'my godparent' (but literally, 'my one who holds you'!) instead of
kelon ·it (hold.TA-linv:3.ChC) 'who holds me', which would seem more logical; or
k·nisuw·iyek (2-be.pair-13.ChC) 'your spouse' (literally, 'your one with whom I am a
pair'!), which is used in place of nisuw·iyeq (be.pair-2.pl.ChC) 'with whom you are a
pair'. These reanalysed forms often become standard: a speaker might say kelonoskok
'your godparents', using a noun plural, instead of kelonoskik, which uses the participial plural. Speakers do, however, say nisuw·ihtic·il (be.pair-3.du.ChC-obv.sg) 'h/h
spouse' (literally, 'with whom s/he is a pair'), and kelon ·ihc·il (hold.TA-inv:3.ChCobv.sg) 'h/h godparent' (literally, 'who [obviative) holds h/h [proximate)').
The noun ehpit 'woman' (plural ehpicik) is participial, but the original verb is no
longer used in this form . It seems to be related to the verb opu 's/he sits' (participle
epit; compare the inanimate counterpart, ote 'it sits', participle ehtek).
Inanimate verb participles are also used as nouns. Many have a locative meaning.sip·tok·eht·as·ik 'accordion' ('which is stretched')siptokehtasik·il 'accordions'long-stringlike-do. to. TI-passi ve.II-O.sg.ChCstretched.II.ChC-O.plmete·ss·ik 'coins, change' ('which is heard moving')

the form ""verb stem+ participial ending"", but are reanalysed by many speakers as
""noun stem + locative ending"". Coincidentally, in the singular, both the inanimate
participial (Changed Conjunct) endings of verbs and the locative endings of nouns
terminate in -k; compare the noun posonut 'basket', locative posonutek 'in or on the
basket' (see Section 4.1.5). Thus a noun pem·sok·h·as (along-with.boards-do.with.tool[TI)-passive.II-) 'floor' is a back-formation from pemsokhasik, as is pemskut 'field', from
pemskutek. There is also a locative form possiyanteskik 'in the window' (possiyantehsok
+ -ik locative). Even though the original participle already conveys the meaning 'in
the window', it is not used in that way. Apparently, speakers no longer think of these
nouns as the verb-forms that they are.
4.1.3. Obviative InflectionObviative forms of nouns have endings whose exact form, like that of the plural, depends upon the final vowel of the stem. Singular forms always end in -1, while plural
forms are characterized by the absence of the final -k. The reader will note that in the
obviative plural cihqonaqc, the final schwa (o) is also dropped. Also, since obviative
plurals have a characteristic low pitch in the final syllable, crhkonaqc proximate
singular is distinct from cihkomlqc obviative plural.cihkonaqcol'turtle' (obviative singular)

syllable of this word is preserved, as it is in possiyantehsok, below (originally pessiyantehsok).
M_os~ likely, in reanalysing the original participle, nemocinuhsihsit, as a noun, speakers have
ehmmated the initial change, though they preserve the change when using nemocinuhsehsit as
a verb- 'when the little one walked sideways'. (Compare mociyehsuhke, Section 3.4.3.) Some
nouns, like kelonosk, retain the intial change of the participle even with personal prefixes, as
noted below, even though changed stems are never prefixed when used as verbs.","[15, 16]"
"2.4. A Hierarchy of Persons: 'You' Always Come(s) before 'Me'
Depending upon the syntax, nouns and verbs may be marked with information
about grammatical person - that is, first person, second person, etc. For example,
when nouns are inflected to show possession, the personal prefixes n-, k-, and w- (or
'-)identify the possessor of the noun.ntul'my boat' (nil)ktul
'tul (wtul)'your boat' (kil)
'h/h boat' (nekom)'our boat' (nilun)
ntulon
'our boat' (kilun)
ktulon
'your boat' (kiluwaw)
ktuluwa
'tuluwa (wtuluwa) 'their boat' (nekomaw)The Independent Indicative forms of transitive inanimate verbs (Section 4.4.4) have
similar prefixes and suffixes. In these forms, the singular direct object (inanimate) is
not marked.ntfhin'I have it''you have it'

5Passamaquoddy-Maliseet11Direct and especially inverse verb forms do some of the ""work"" of the active and
passive voices in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, which does not have a way of
distinguishing 's/he asks them' from 'they are asked by h/h'. Transitive verbs do
have forms for passives with indefinite (unspecified) subjects- 'it is heard', 'I am
asked' (see Section 4.4).
Reflexive ('you ask yourself') and reciprocal ('you ask each other') verbs are no
longer transitive, but become intransitive. The action is ""self-contained"" with respect
to grammatical person and rank on the hierarchy, whether the subject and object are
the same individual(s)- 'self' (marked by -s-)- or different- 'each other', 'one another' (marked by -t-).k·papehcim·t·ipa 'you (dual) ask each other'nil, nilunn·papehcim·s 'I ask myself'

not marked for personOther evidence for this hierarchy comes from transitive animate verb forms . These
use prefixes and endings similar to those shown on the previous page, and carry
additional markers which show whether the subject is above the object on the
hierarchy (direct forms) or below it (inverse forms). Some studies (e.g., LeSourd,
1993a) consider first and second person as occupying a single level of the hierarchy;
they are separated here to account for the use of the personal prefixes in verb and
possessed noun forms . Switching the relationship from direct to inverse changes the
verb, as shown in the following examples. (See also the final examples in Section
2.3.2, and see Section 4.4 for more information about the forms themselves.)n·papehci·m·a·k 'I ask them'- npapehci·m·ku·k 'they ask met11

10The full form of these suffixes is -onu- and -ennu- when further endings follow, as in thenilun forms ntihinennul 'we have them (inanimate)', ntulonul 'our boats', and [n]nicannuk 'our

11 This
verb represents Maliseet usage. Passamaquoddy speakers say ntoqecimulak 'I ask
them', ntoqecimulkuk, etc., and use npapecimak to say 'I find out the truth from them'.2-ask.TA-recip.AI-2.du.Ind2-ask.TA-refl.AI-2.du.IndCertain of the first and second person pronouns overlap in meaning- for example,

002.5. Time and Physical Space: The Speaker's Personal Point of View
Finally, Passamaquoddy-Maliseet is characterized by the way in which space and
time are organized from the speaker's personal point of view. Space is always described in relative terms. Speakers do not use arbitrary, permanent descriptors, such
as latitude-and-longitude, distances measured in kilometres, or street addresses, to
describe locations, directions, or orientations. They construe time in a parallel way,
relative to 'now', without naming fixed points, such as '1 January 2000', or using
arbitrary units like hours and centuries.
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet distinguishes three ""places"" where things are located and
events occur- yut 'here, near me the speaker', nit 'there, near you the listener', and
yet 'yonder'. Nit is the ""default'' location, used to refer to space that is out of view or
situated in a story or an historical account. The demonstrative pronouns (SectionLW/M2712Passamaquoddy-Maliseet4.2.1) are organized in the same way as these spatial locations. Although yut and yet
are not used with respect to time, nit is equivalent to 'then'; neke 'in the past' and yaka
'in the future' are absentative forms of demonstrative pronouns.mehsi skat na nekom yut ih·ihq? 'and why isn't s/he here?'

early.particle Joseph must there to.there-swim.AI
yet n·kisi punom·on suwahqihikon 'I placed the bell over there'
yonder 1-past-put.TI-Sub/Ind bell
More than the word yut 'here' orients the speaker and listener in the environment. A
particular subset of the initial roots called preverbs (see Section 4.6)- systematically
specifies location, direction, and orientation in verbs. Two of the most commonly
used are ckuwi- (weckuwi-) 'toward here' and o/omi- (elomi-) 'away from here'.
Geographical features and the passage of time are ordinarily described using such
preverbs.ckuwi qasku 's/he runs toward here', ckuhqepu 's/he sits facing toward here'
weckuwakomek 'where a lake extends toward here'
weckuwikotok 'as the year(s) come toward now' (i.e., 'in the coming year[s]')
olomi qasku 's/he runs away from here', olomuhqepu 's/he sits facing away from here'
elomakomek 'where a lake extends away from here, down the lake'
elomikotok 'as the year(s) go away from now' (i.e., 'in the year[s] beginning now')
Compare these preverbs with peci- 'toward' and mace- 'away, beginning', which indicate direction or orientation relative to any location, not just 'here', or any point in
time, not just 'now'.peci qasku 's/he runs toward, arrives running'
pecikotok 'as the year(s) arrive' (i.e., 'in the following year[s]')
mace qasku 's/he runs away, sets off running'
macekotok 'as the year(s) begin'
Two ""place-holder"" preverbs- oli- 'thus; to there' and oloqi- 'in that direction' signal location, direction, or orientation that cannot be specified in a preverb. These
depend upon other words in the clause or sentence to complete their meaning. In the
second example below, the particle oloqiw 'in the direction of' echoes the preverb.","[8, 9, 10]"
"1.2. Pronouncing Passarnaquoddy-Maliseet
The Passamaquoddy-Maliseet standard orthography uses 17 letters and an apostrophe to represent the sounds of the language. The brief summary in this section is intended to help the reader with the examples in the following sections. A more detailed description of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet phonemics and phonology will be
found in Section 3.
The five vowel-sounds of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet are a (father), e (bed), i (ski), o
(apron- the schwa sound), and u (sue); the combination eh sounds like the vowel in
tack. Vowel-blends are aw (as in English how), iw (few), ew (as in Spanish Europa), ay
(tie), and ey (grey).
The twelve consonants fall into two groups. The first set - h, /, m, n, w, y - have
sounds like those in English. The Jetter h is pronounced before a vowel; before a
consonant it is silent or lightly pronounced.
The remaining consonants are c (char-jar), k (kale-gale), p (pat-bat), q (quaverguava), s (sip-zip), and t (toe-doe). In Passamaquoddy-Ma!iseet, these consonants
have the first, unvoiced sound when next to any other consonant; otherwise they have
the second, voiced sound, as illustrated by the sounds of p and c in the following
words: ape (AHPCH, 'again, next'); peciye (beh-]EE-yeh, 's/he arrives')2; pihce (BEE-cheh,
'far away'); sihpac (ZEE-pahj, 'pail'), kpihtin (KPEE-teen, 'your hand'). The sole
exception to this pattern is that when a consonant follows the first person prefix n- 'I,
we' it remains voiced- npihtin (NBEE-teen, 'my hand'). Compare npisun (NPEE-zoon,
'medicine') in which then- is not a prefix, and consequently the p remains unvoiced.32The abbreviation 's/he' will be used throughout to translate the third person singular pronoun nekom, which is not sex-specific. Likewise, 'h/h' is used for 'his/her' or 'him/her'.
'S/he' and 'h/h' also represent any grammatically animate noun or pronoun.
3Such a contrast would seem to indicate that ""voicing has a marginally distinctive status in
these consonants"" (LeSourd, 1993, p. 37), but because this is the only exception, the standard
orthography uses a single letter to represent each ""pair'' of sounds. This feature of the orthography allows words that are clearly the same to be spelled the same- npihtin, kpihtin,
'pihtin.",[5]
"4.2. Pronounstan olu Maliw? 'where is Mary (absentative)?' (the focus is on her absence)
compare lama iyu Mall? 'where is Mary?' (an information question)Passamaquoddy-Maliseet has personal, demonstrative, interrogative pronouns, the
last two with animate and inanimate forms. The word 'other' is also a pronoun. One
of the most interesting pronouns is a hesitator or filler, which in PassamaquoddyMaliseet is inflected to match the anticipated noun.n·koska·ht·un·ek·t31 nt·apq·tisok·ihfkon·ok·ol 'I lost my keys' (they were just now here)

unique; no plural endings are used. The seven personal pronouns are listed in Table
I, Section 2.3.",[18]
"\
1Passamaquoddy-Maliseet' verbs are classified according to the final root in their
stems, which marks them as transitive or intransitive. Each of these categories is further divided according to the grammatical gender of the subject (intransitive verbs)
or direct object (transitive verbs). The major types of verbs and the variations are explained in the following sections.
4.3.1. Transitivity and GenderIn Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, intransitive and transitive verbs have different types of
stems, as can be seen in the following pair of sentences.
28Note the use here of an intransitive verb with the indefinite pronoun keq as direct object.
Compare keq ktotoli oluhk? 'what are you doing?', also with an intransitive verb. If the object
of the dog's search is overt, the verb must be modified (see Section 4.3.2): 'talikhahsin skonis
's/he is looking around for a bone' (see Section 4.3.2).",[19]

Double-object verbs are built on a verb ti stem with the addition of a marker -uw-,
called a benefactive, which marks the relationship among the subject, direct object,
and indirect object.30 This complete Ia +object stem is in effect a Ia stem: it takes endings like those of ta verbs, using the Subordinative mode in lieu of the Independent
Indicative in much the same way as ai +object verbs, with additional endings, as required, to mark the number and obviation of the direct object. The comments in the
previous section about the Conjunct, Subordinative, and Imperative forms of ai +
object verbs also apply to ta +object verbs.
Double object verbs have passive, reflexive, and reciprocal forms.nkomutonaken (ta +object) 'I have been stolen from' (passive)

As in the case of ai + object verbs, there are some restrictions on who - and whatcan be the object of a ta +object verb. The direct object cannot be '1', 'you', or 'us'. The
indirect object can be any grammatical person (first, second, third, obviative), but it
cannot be inanimate. Speakers find another way to translate 'they stole me from my
mother' (first person direct object) or 'I stole money from the church' (inanimate
indirect object).","[21, 22]"
"Nouns and demonstrative pronouns have absentative forms, using various markers,
including changes in pitch contour. These forms are a further indication of the way in
which space and time are structured from the speaker's particular perspective. They
indicate the absence - in time or space, or in personal knowledge - of the noun
they refer to. Someone or something may be missing, lost, dead, or just unexpectedly
absent: Piyel mfhtaqsokol'Peter's late father'; compare Piyel mfhtaqsol'Peter's father

"The singular pronouns have emphatic forms: animate wotta, notta, and yata; inanimate yuta, nita, and yeta. The pronouns not and nit can also be used with reference to
someone or something whose exact location is unimportant, or which cannot be seen
by either the speaker or the listener or which are imaginary or are spoken of in the
past or future (as in a story or plan). In these senses, not sometimes means 's/he,
him/her', nit can mean 'it', and the plurals, niktok and nihtol, are equivalent to 'they'.kot6k 'another' kotokik 'others'

yeke(w)k6tokil (obv. sing.)Finally, Passamaquoddy-Maliseet has a ""hesitator"" pronoun, used before nouns in
much the same way as the filler uh ... or er ... in English. Interestingly, this pronoun,
iyey, in always inflected to match the anticipated word: nkisewestuwama iyey ... Mali 'I
spoke to uh ... Mary'; nkisi puna ntahtuwossomut ihik ... tuwihputik 'I put my cup on the
uh ... table'.",[19]
"5.1. Sentences without Verbs
Since there is no verb 'to be' in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, identity sentences consist
of nouns and pronouns only. Word order in identities is somewhat less free (it is
fixed in negative identities) than in sentences with verbs. Kat is the negative particle
for identity sentences.",[30]
"2.3.2. Third Person ""Possessed"" Forms2.3.3. Obviative Subject of an Intransitive VerbIn English, in order to show possession, speakers change the word referring to theWhen an obviative noun is the subject of an intransitive verb, the verb also has an
obviative inflection.possessor: Mary becomes Mary's, boys becomes boys', you becomes your, and I becomes my. By contrast, in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet it is the word referring to the one
possessed which is modified: npihtin, kpihtin, 'pihtin (Section 1.2).
In addition, when one animate noun ""belongs"" to another- i.e., to 'him', 'her,' or
'them' - it is obviative; the possessor and the possessed cannot both occupy thesame grammatical space. (In the examples below, the second form of the obviative
plural is more frequently used by Maliseet speakers.)n·itap (1-friend.dep9) 'my friend', k·itap·iyik (2-friend.dep-3.pl) 'your friends' (prox.)
Piyel w·itap·iyil (Peter 3-friend.dep-obv.sg) 'Peter's friend' (obviative)
Piyel w·itap·iyi· (w·itap·i·) (Peter 3-friend.dep-[obv.pl)) 'Peter's friends' (obviative pl.)
Piyel '·tul (w·tul) (Peter 3-boat.dep) 'Peter's boat' (inanimate, thus not obviative)
but not Piyel •witap (proximate and possessed by a third person noun)
In witapiyil, the possessor (Peter) is proximate, and the ""possessed"" (his friend) is obviative; the ending -iyil marks the obviative. When such a possessed form (obviative)
is used with a transitive verb, the verb form indicates who loves whom, as in the
following sentences.",[8]

In the first sentence, wasis is proximate because it is the only third person noun. In
the second sentence, the subject is third person proximate (Mali), so an animate direct
object must be obviative. Obviative singular nouns are marked by an -1- in the
ending, which is usually word-final, as in wasisol; the verb also ends in this -1.

7Le5ourd (1993a) uses an acute accent to mark a relatively high-pitched stressed syllable. A
grave accent indicates a relatively low-pitched stressed syllable. A circumflex (natokehkima
's/he goes there to be taught') marks distinctively low-pitched final unstressed syllables,
which occur in only a few forms. These marks have not been used in most texts published to
date in the standard orthography. In this volume, the accent markings are used only when
stress and pitch are under discussion and in comparing words which are spelled alike.",[7]
"2.1. Noun and Verb Roots
Like the other Algonquian languages, Passamaquoddy-Maliseet forms words by
chaining together verb and noun roots (abundant examples may be found in
LeSourd, 1984, and in other works cited in the present volume). These meaningful
units of speech are not usually words in themselves but occur only in combination
with other roots and inflectional prefixes and endings. Speakers routinely ""invent""
words as they talk by combining the roots required for the meaning and feeling they
want to express. For example, ksakolahqiskipepisossultipa 'you little ones have your
scarves on tight', which is not an unusual word, conveys both a precise description
and an affectionate tone. It comprises the following roots and inflections.k·sakol·ahq·iskipe·pis·oss-ult·ipa
'you (second person)' (an inflectional prefix)
k'tight, hard': a preverb (initial root)
-sakol'stick-like': a shape classifier (medial root)
-ahq'neck, nape': a body-part classifier (medial root)
-iskipe'be wrapped': the verb (final root)
-pis'diminutive' (a theme marker, final)
-oss'plural (more than two)' (a theme marker, final)
-ult'you dual/plural' (an inflectional ending)
-ipa
n·sakol·ahq·iskipe·pis·oss·ult·ipon 'we (excl.) little ones have our scarves on tight'
k·sakol·ahq·iskipe-pis·ipon 'we (you and I) have our scarves on tight'
k·sakol·ahq·ikone-pis·ipon 'we (you and I) have our leg-warmers on tight'
If the inflectional prefix is changed to n- 'I, we (first person)' and the ending to -ipon
'we', then the meaning of the word changes from 'you' to 'we (others and I)'. If k'you' is restored and -oss- and -ult- omitted, then the word refers to 'two of us (you
and I)', who are not diminutive. If the body-part classifier is changed to -ikone- 'leg',
then the meaning of the whole word changes from 'scarves' to, perhaps, 'legwarmers' . There is no noun 'scarf' in these words, but 'scarf' is implied by the rootsLW/M275Passamaquoddy-Maliseet'neck' and 'wrap'. Many meanings which are nouns in English are expressed as verbs
in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet.
Some roots stand on their own as words. Sakom 'chief' is a typical noun, composed of
a single root, with inflected forms such as sakom·ak 'chiefs' or '·sakom·am·uwa·l (3chief-poss-nonl.pl-obv.sg) 'their chief' . Some verbs, for example qask·u (run-3.sg.Ind)
's/he runs', have an imperative form which consists of a single root with no inflectional prefixes or endings: qasq! '(you, singular) run!' Almost always, however, verbs
occur with at least one inflectional affix. Also, there is no infinitive form ('to run'),
and so an inflected form (usually 's/he runs') must be used for such purposes as a
dictionary entry.",[6]

given form; 'tusol 'h/h daughter' represents the obviative singular. The ti forms
shown are for a singular direct object. In the ta forms, the paired pronouns represent
subject and object, respectively, with direct forms in the left column of each list and
inverse forms in the right column (forms for kil-nilun and kiluwaw-nilun are identical,
as are the inverse forms in the same line).
""Passive"" forms are those in which the actor is not specified or marked: 'it is carried
thus' (ti), 'I am carried thus' (ta). The ti passives are actually ii verbs; all have stem-final -as(i)- which marks them as passive. The passive forms of ta verbs are marked by
-oke- in the first and second person; third person forms are like ai verbs in that they
do not have a personal prefix, and they use some endings from the ai paradigms. 31 In
the ta passive, the third person form serves for both proximate and obviative.
The vowel shown in parentheses at the end of the ai, ii, and ti stems in Tables VII
through XV is the stem vowel, which, like that in nouns (Section 4.1.1), determi.nes
the shape of the endings. The sample verbs here illustrate only one of the poss1ble
stem vowels for each type of verb. Although as a rule each verb has only one stem
vowel, there are a few verbs whose stem vowel varies, usually in particular forms.
For example,lossin 's/he is lying down thus' has the stem -olcJ~i~(o)-, but so~e
speakers (or the same speaker at different times) treat the stem as 1f 1t were -o/oss.(z)especially in Conjunct forms, elossinok or e/ossit, respectively, 'when s/he was lymg
down thus'.
31The ai verbs also have ""indefinite subject"" forms; for example, luhk·an 'working; there is
work' (Independent Indicative) and skat eluk·hot·imuhk (that.not work.AI-pl-indef.ChC.neg)
'when not working; when there isn't work' (from luhke 's/he works'). Compare the ending
-imuhk with that on the third person negative ta passive eliphamuhk (Table VITI).",[22]
"LW/M2747Passamaquoddy-Maliseetspekopu 's/he has a high rank'- spi 'high' + -ek- (e.g., flag or uniform) +
final -op(i)- 'sit'
-anok- 'consisting of or arranged in layers'
spanokahte 'it (e.g., a book) is thick'- spi + -anok- + -aht(e)Medial roots for body-parts and geographical features are often similar to their
""stand-alone"" counterparts: -ptin- is clearly a reduction of -pihtin-, and -tun- has the
same form as either a verb root (kin·tun·at [big-mouth-3.sg.ChC] 'who has a big
mouth') or a noun ('tun 'h/h mouth). In contrast, the medial root -aluw- 'tail' bears no
resemblance to the noun 'soqon 'h/h tail', nor is -akom- (elomakomek 'down the lake')
related to the noun qospem 'lake'. Speakers have at their disposal both incorporated
and unincorporated noun roots, though not all referents will be found in both lists. In
recent years the tendency among speakers has been toward the use of more
unincorporated nouns with simpler verbs, undoubtedly an influence of English.
Final roots are verbal; they denote an action, emotion, state, etc. Some are specific,
like the ai finals -hp(i)- 'eat', -ossin(o)- 'lie down'. But many are abstract, like theta fina!-ehl- 'do to h/h', whose ti equivalent is -eht(u)- 'do it, do X to it': nulehla 'I fix h/h
(e.g., a bicycle)', nulehtun 'I fix it' -woli 'good'nmemihp 'I have had enough to eat'- memi 'reaching a limit' +
fina!-hp(i)- 'eat, eat a meal' (ai)
ncuwahpossin 'I am lying down, partway into the water' - cuwahpi 'into the water' +
final-ossin(o)- 'lie, lie down' (ai)
nsusqihtaha 'I knock h/h flat on back'- susqi 'supine' + -ht_h- 'strike, hit' (ta)
Some finals ""stand alone"" as verbs (provided they are inflected): qasku 's/he runs',
root -qasq(i)-; ame 's/he fishes', root -am(e)-; [w]micin 's/h~ eats it', .r?ot -mic- <;i_>.
There are also a few verb forms which appear to have no fmal: ntoll I go there IS
formed from the stem -oliy(a)-, which consists of ali- 'thus; to there' and the final
-y(a)- 'go' . In the first person singular, Independent In~icat~ve, no e_n ding is use~.
This would result in ""ntoliy""; but words do not end w1th -1y (long 1), and theY IS
dropped, leaving ntolf, - the personal prefix and the preverb only (also ktolf 'you
[kil] go there'). A few other verbs have such apparently rootless forms.",[27]
"3.4.1. Use of Apostrophe
The ""missing"" consonants which apostrophes represent are real: they were once pronounced, as we know from old transcriptions and from the fact that many are still
pronounced by older speakers. Also, these dropped consonants are present in other
forms of the word.'tomakey·u (ktomakey·u) (-3.sg.Ind) 's/he is poor'
n·k6tomakey (1-) 'I am poor'; ketonufkey·it (-3.sg.ChC) 'when s/he was poor'
but not •n·tomakey 'I am poor' (personal prefix without stem-initial k-)
'pisun (npisun) 'medicine'
skicinuwi npisun 'Indian medicine'12; k·nopisun (2-) 'your (kil) medicine'
musa 'tom·ahkoc! (wtom·ahkoc) (-2.sg.Imp.neg) 'don't (kil) smoke!'
mace wtom·e (-3.sg.Ind) 's/he starts to smoke'
wetom·at (-3.sg.ChC) 'when s/he smoked'
Many older speakers retain a dropped w- as a soundless lip-rounding before the following consonant; it may be pronounced more distinctly when the preceding word
ends in a vowel. The w- in these examples is part of the verb root. A dropped w- may
also be the prefix that marks the third person; this w- does not ""reappear"" in other
forms.'·tus·ol (w·tus·o/) 'h/h daughter'- n·tus 'my daughter'- tus 'daughter' (vocative)
3-daughter.dep-obv.sg - 1-daughter.dep - daughter.dep

3-shoot.TA-dir:3.Ind-obv.sg - 1-shoot.TA-dir:3.Ind - shoot.TA-refl.AI-3.sg.Ind12Most younger speakers say sldcinuwi 'pisun. Sldcinuwi npisun is a single word and is pronounced as a single word (skicinuwinpisun), but in the standard orthography it is written
with a space since the prenoun sldcinuwi and the noun npisun can each stand on its own. This
is simply a convention which serves to make reading easier. (Also true of mace wtome in the
following example.)As suggested by the examples in Section 3.4.1, Passamaquoddy-Maliseet words have
an underlying structure- called a ""stem"" -on which the spoken forms are built.
The stem itself may take various shapes, and it is this feature that is examined here.",[12]
"Passamaquoddy-Maliseet has three demonstrative pronouns, each with paired animate and inanimate forms. These are, respectively, wot-yut 'this, near me the speaker'; not-nil'that, near you the listener'; and yat-yet 'yonder, away from you and me,
but within sight'. These meanings of these three pairs correspond with those of the
locative particles yut, nit, and yet, mentioned in section 2.5. The meaning of each ~f
the three pronouns varies within a range according to the context. The forms of ammate demonstrative pronouns are as follows.",[18]
"LW/M278Passamaguoddy-Maliseetbut not •Mali 'koselomak was{sok (both nouns proximate)LW/M279Passarnaguodd y-MaliseetHere, in the first sentence we see the -k which marks the animate proximate plural. In
the second sentence, however, both the verb and the obviative noun Jack this -k. The
marker for the obviative plural in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet is- no marker (i.e., a
""zero"" markerS). The word, however, does acquire a falling intonation: thus wtfsis
proximate singular and wdsis obviative plural do not sound quite the same. (See also
the final examples in the next section.)The difference in the second sentence is in the verb. The ""inverse"" marker -oku- redirects the verb so that the obviative noun is the actor, and the proximate noun the goal
-as opposed to the ""direct"" form with proximate actor and obviative goal, marked
by -a-. It is open to debate which noun in the second sentence is the ""subject"" and
which the ""object""; the two translations given are equally acceptable to speakers. (See
also Table IT, in Section 2.4, and the discussion which follows it.) Word order in most
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet sentences is quite free, the inflectional markings showing
the words' relationship to one another.","[7, 8]"

"3.4. The Standard Orthography as a Reflection of Phonology
The standard orthography used for Passamaquoddy-Maliseet was developed and
perfected by a number of linguists and Native speakers who collaborated successively during the 1960s and 1970s. Harvard linguist Karl Teeter's work (e.g., Teeter,
1971) with Peter Lewis Paul, a Maliseet of Woodstock, New Brunswick, resulted in
the first writing system designed for the language. This was adapted for practical
typewriting by Wayne Newell (Passamaquoddy), the director of the Wabnaki
Bilingual Education Program at Indian Township, Maine, then working with MIT
linguist Kenneth Hale, so that it could be used in storybooks and instructional materials. In particular, u replaced o, and o could then be used in place of a to represent
schwa.
The teachers and curriculum developers in the bilingual program and a number of
linguists working with them made further refinements to account for double consonants (mattihikon 'whip, prod, poker [for fire)' vs. mahtihikon 'lid-lifter [for woodstove)'; Section 3.5.2); to standardize the writing of schwa (o) as u before w, where it
is always rounded (nutuwak 'I hear them'); and to show the unstressed schwas frequently ""inaudible"" in speech (welomahtaq 'who has a good disposition', pahtoliyas
'priest'; Sections 3.5.1 and 3.5.3). Additional contributors during that time wereLW/M 2716Passamaquoddy-MaliseetLW/M2717Passamaquoddy-MaliseetPassamaquoddy language consultant David Francis, of Pleasant Point; teachers Anna
Harnois and Mary Ellen (Stevens) Socobasin, of Indian Township; linguist Philip
LeSourd, then a student of Kenneth Hale's; and materials and curriculum developer
Robert Leavitt. Laura Knecht, another of Hale's students, suggested using apostrophe to represent ""missing'' initial consonants.","[11, 12]"
"Conjunctions include naka 'and', kosona 'or', on 'and then', kenuk 'but', apeq 'although',
'sami 'because', mesq 'before', tokec or nehtaw 'if'. The conjunction 'and' is omitted in
expressions such as nilun Mali 'Mary and I', ki/uwaw Piyel 'you and Peter', and kilun

"LW/M2720Passamaquoddy-Maliseet3.5. Additional Notes on Phonology
In the standard orthography, an unstressed schwa (o) is written whenever it has notbeen dropped by syncope. This schwa can be heard in careful (i.e., slow)
pronunciation, but is usually inaudible, or just barely audible, in ordinary conversation. (Recall that schwa is written as u before w.)
3.5.1. Sonorants (1, m, n, w19) Separated by Unstressed Schwa (o)
It is often difficult to hear an unstressed schwa between sonorants. LeSourd, how-ever, has shown (1993a, pp. 276 ff.) that an unstressed schwa (o) is dropped between
sonorants (1, m, n, w) only when the two sonorants are identical and neither is adjacent to another consonant- [k].kaf.l.opa20 ([2]-hide.TA-2inv:l-2.pl) 'I hide you (kiluwaw)'. Compare kt·ol·ehl·ol·on (2-thus-do.to.TA-2inv:l-sg.Sub) '(and then) I do thus to
you (kil)', where schwa is not deleted following the consonant cluster -hi-. The
exception is that unstressed schwa is not deleted between equal sonorants in wordfinal syllables - wflol 'h/h tongue', nicanon 'our (nilun) child'. In words like
mfnuw·uwikhl'k·e (over.again-write.AI-3.sg.Ind) 's/he rewrites it', the schwa (u) between the two w's is not unstressed.
The presence of these unstressed schwas is reflected in the standard orthography in
the form of a spelling rule: always write a schwa (o or u, as appropriate) between unequal sonorants.olomuhse 's/he walks away'
wiwoniye 's/he goes around (circumferentially)'
pomolamson 'wind blows along'
oluwikonok 'seven'
amuwes 'bee'
3.5.2. Double Consonants
Under the proper conditions (see LeSourd, 1993a), syncope can occur between any
pair of identical consonants, resulting in a double (or ""long"") consonant. When
word-medial, the twin consonants can each be heard.accihte 'it changes colour'
tolahhik 'they (dual) are playing'21
nekkapit 'who is blind'
olluhke 's/he works thus'(-ac- 'changing' + -ociht- 'be of a colour')
(-otolay- 'be playing' + -ihik 'they [dual]')
(-nokihka- 'to completion' + [?])
(-of- 'thus' + -oluhk- 'work')LW/M27'tommal 's/he bites h/h in two'
nicannuk 'our (nilun) children'
teppu 's/he sits in something'
eqqa 's/he stops dancing'
kissonte 'it is Monday'
pettemu 's/he arrives crying'
nihtawwikhik 'I know how to write'
eyyin 'where you (kif) are'21Passamaquoddy-Maliseet(-tom- 'apart' +-om- 'bite')
(-nican- 'child' + -onu- 'we' + -ok [plural])
(-tep- 'in' + -op- 'sit')
(-ehq- 'stop' + -ok- 'dance')
(-kis- 'past' + -osont- 'be Sunday')
(-pee- 'toward' + -otem- 'cry')
(-nihtaw- 'know how to' + -uwikhik- 'write')
(-iy- 'be in a place' [changed: ey-] + -iyin 'kif')Double obstruents, except -ec, also occur in word-final position: poeokk 'splat!', ntepp
'I sit in something', ktewepotoqq 'you (kif) jump up', ess 'clam', tett 'in that direction'.
3.5.3. Unstressed Schwa and a Sonorant (1, m, n, w) following he, hk, hp, hq, hs, ht
Another situation in which unstressed schwa may be difficult to hear is in words
where a sonorant (1, m, n, w) follows an unvoiced obstruent (he, hk, hp, hq, hs, ht22).
The schwa (o) is always written in these syllables.'eeheoloqs 'gland'
tolotehkomon 's/he kicks it to there'
'totolihponolal 's/he is fighting h/h'
wihqonomon 's/he pulls it'
pahtoliyas 'priest'
'cikihtuwal 's/he lets go of h/h'(compare eehcis 'vein')
(-of- 'to there'+ -otehkom- 'kick')
(-otol- [progressive] + -hponol- 'fight against')
(-wihq- 'pulling' +-on- '[do] by hand')
(from French, patriarehe)
(-cikihtuw- 'let go of; stop bothering')When schwa (o) occurs between -hq- and -w-, the resulting sound (and spelling) is
-hkuw-: [wJ.nute·hkuw·a·l ([3]-out-push.TA-dir:3.Ind-obv.sg) 's/he pushes h/h out'.
Because the schwa (here u) is barely pronounced, it may seem that this word should
be spelled ""nutehqal"", but others forms of the verb, and those like it, show typical
modifications of the final -uw-: it is reduced to -u- in knutehkul 'I push you (kif) out'
(from k- + -nutehkuw- + -ol); and it becomes -a- when followed by the -o- in the
inverse markers -oku- (nutehkakuk 'they push me out', from n- + -nutehkuw- + -oku- +
-k and -oke- (nutehkakepon 'we [nilun] are pushed out', from n- + -nutehkuw- + -oke- +-pon).2322Note that he rarely occurs before schwa, but is usually realized as ht- as for example inmehtoluhke 's/he finishes working', from mehci (preverb) 'finish' and the root -oluhk- 'work'.","[13, 14]"
"The stem of the verb 'tomakeyu (ktomakeyu) 's/he is poor' is -kotomakey-,13 to which
endings and personal prefixes are added. (The hyphens at each end indicate that
such attachments are possible.) In this particular word, as in most verbs and many
nouns, the stem cannot be used without at least one prefix or ending. A typical pattern for verb stems whose first syllable has the vowel o is that this o ""drops out""
when no prefix is used in the form required. This phenomenon is called ""syncope""
and may occur in other parts of the stem as well (see LeSourd, 1993a, pp. 158ff.).
Thus ktomakeyu- and ktomakeyit ('tomakeyit) 'if s/he is poor', in which both the k and
the t (or 't-) are unvoiced; there is no vowel between them. In nkotomakey 'I am poor',
the personal prefix n- ""calls up"" the vowel in the first syllable because personal
prefixes cannot be affixed to consonant clusters14; the k and the t, now separated by a
vowel, are voiced (recall that the personal prefix n- does not ""devoice"" a following
consonant). They are also voiced in ketomakeyit 'when s/he was poor', the ""changed""
form (Section 3.4.3).",[12]

The Passamaquoddy-Maliseet consonants are shown in Table VI. The letters h, /, m, n,
w, andy represent sounds much the same as those in English; his pronounced before
a vowel, silent or just barely heard before a consonant. The sound of I is velarized in
all positions, and w is less rounded than in English (LeSourd, 1993a).
Two letters in the standard orthography, c and q, appear to represent a combination
of sounds but can be shown to be unit phonemes just like the other obstruents, k, p, s,
and t (see, e.g., LeSourd, 1993a, pp. 36-37), since they vary in exactly the same way.
The consonant c is an alveopalatal affricate e), as in Italian cello. The consonant q,
sometimes written kw- k with lip-rounding- is distinct from the combination kw-;
this consonant pair occurs only at the beginning of words where k- 'you' comes before an initial w-; compare k·wik (KWEEG) 'you (kil) dwell', and qin (GWEEN) 'really'.

hPassamaguoddy-Maliseetgw
z*First person: n·sip·um (1-river-poss) ('n-ZEEB-oom) 'my private spot'.
As noted in Section 1.4, apostrophe (') indicates a missing initial consonant which is
no longer pronounced. It is written only word initially and only before c, k, p, q, s, or
t, when one of these precedes a vowel. The apostrophe shows that the consonant is
preaspirated and devoiced, the residual effects of the dropped consonant.","[10, 11]"
"LW/M2713Passamaquoddy-MaliseetThe few examples here only suggest the complex ways in which space and time are
continually reconceived and reconstructed according to the speaker's location, so
that personal identity is integrally tied to the space and time - both physical and
social -in which the speaker moves. A language like English allows the construction of space and time without reference to a human presence. In PassamaquoddyMaliseet an impersonal point of view is difficult to adopt.",[10]
"3.4.2. Dropping Unstressed Schwa (Syncope)The result of this long process was a writing system that reflects elegantly the
phonemics and the phonology of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet. Sections 3.4 and 3.5 illustrate both the orthography and sound patterns in the language.",[12]

54Penobscot and Abenaki, to the west, are the languages closest to PassamaquoddyMaliseet, but there are now only a handful of speakers of Abenaki and none of
Penobscot. Micmac, the other Native language of the region, is spoken in northern
and eastern New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and the Gaspe. It is
also closely related to Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, and many words are virtually the
same, but the two languages are not mutually intelligible.",[4]

The dubitative preterit expresses ""doubt or uncertainty, Jack of direct knowledge, or
some conclusion on the part of the speaker"" (Sherwood, 1986, p. 145). In the
Independent Indicative and Unchanged Conjunct dubitative forms are marked for
the preterit as well; hence the name of the tense. Table XV shows Independent
Indicative forms; there are also Changed Conjunct, Unchanged Conjunct, and
Subordinative forms .tama ntopips? 'where was I sitting?' (I don't remember)- Independent Indicative

Unlike its sister language Micmac, Passamaquoddy-Maliseet does not have future
tense endings for verbs. Instead speakers use particles and preverbs with present
tense forms to indicate the future.yaka 'in the future'

Passamaquoddy-Malis eet verbs, more than any other words, are the domain of the
eloquent speaker. Speakers construct verbs by combining preverbs and initial, medial, and final verb roots to express the meanings they require. Eloquent speakers
combine them inventively, even playfully or outrageously when the occasion demands. Lewis Mitchell, for example, a Passamaquoddy who wrote down many stories from the oral tradition in the late 1800s, used mehqahtuwehpusossit 'the little red
twinkling one', seskahtuwet 'the one that shines fiercely', and mehqahtuwessit 'the flickering red one' to describe stars, while at the same time indicating their personalities
as husbands-to-be, from the point of view of two star-gazing sisters (Prince, 1921;
Francis & Leavitt, 1994, 1995). To do this, he selected from and combined the
following roots.-moqq- (unprefixed: pq-; changed: mehq-) 'red'
seski- 'fierce'
-ahtuw(e)- 'shine'
-hpus(i)- 'shake'
-ss(i)- 'move suddenly, unexpectedly'
-oss- 'diminutive'initial

ai final
ai final
ai final
theme marker (final)Roots are termed initial, medial, or final according to the position they invariably occupy in the complete stem. (Preverbs, a special type of initial root, are described in
Section 4.6.) Initial roots, like -moqq- 'red', are usually adjectival or adverbial- for
example, puskosone 's/he has wet shoes', from pus- 'wet' and the medial/final
-ahkoson- 'shoe' (compare nmakson 'my shoe'). Another initial root is -koss- 'washing':
koss·atpe·n·s·u (washing-top.of.head-with.hand.TA-self.AI-3.sg.Ind) 's/he washes own
hair'.
Medial roots may be nominal, adjectival, or adverbial. They denote such things as
body parts and geographical features, shapes and arrangements, which are thus incorporated into verbs. Medials become finals when the whole verb describes the
noun which the medial names.-ptin(e)- 'hand, arm'
tomiptinessu 's/he breaks own arm'- tomi 'apart'; final -ss(i)- 'move suddenly'
kiniptine 's/he has big hands'- kini 'big' (-ptin[e]- is final here)
-ek- 'sheet-like in shape; two-dimensional and flexible'
wolekte 'it (e.g., a cloth) is nicely placed' -woli 'good'+ -ek- + final-aht(e)- 'sit'35The preverbs koti and kotuwi- also mean 'want to'. Koti cannot ""attach"" to a verb.","[25, 26, 27]"
