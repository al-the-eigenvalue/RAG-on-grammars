"The personal pronouns with the agent role seem to be inherently topical, so they are
always encoded as the subject. In other words, the Locative forms of the personal pronouns
cannot function as the passive agent, and the corresponding active construction is used instead.
The next example shows that if the agent argument within the conjoined clause is a personal
pronoun, passivization does not apply, but the first clause subject controls the null copy in the

3.5. Noun phrase
A noun phrase consists of a head and an optional modifier. The following grammatical
classes function as nominal heads: nouns, pro-nouns, and nominalized elements. Pro-nouns
cannot take a modifier, with the exception of the relative clause. The following classes of
modifiers are available: nouns (which function as possessive and non-possessive modifiers),
pro-nouns, adjectives, pro-adjectives, numerals, postpositional phrases, and the relative5253clause. Typically, nouns cannot be modified by a simple adverbial or an oblique-case NP. The

"The anaphoric vs. the grammatical status of agreement can be revealed by a number of
syntactic tests. Remarkably, the predictions Bresnan and Mchombo make with respect to theanaphoric object agreement turn out to be wrong for Ostyak, suggesting that Ostyak object
agreement is of a grammatical character,
As Bresnan and Mchombo argue, verbal case government is completely inconsistent
with the object marker being an incorporated argument anaphorically linked to topic. Since
the topical object NP is related to the verb not by government but by anaphora with the object
marker, the verb cannot assign it a case (Bresnan and Mchombo 1987: 765). If the object case
and the anaphoric object marker coexist in a language, they are predicted to be in
complementary distribution (as attested, for example, in Arabic). But in Ostyak, at least
personal pronouns in the object function bear the morphologically overt Accusative regardless
of object agreement (see 2.1.2.1) and there is no reason to think that the case is not governed
by the verb. And, although lexical objects do not have an overt Accusative marker, they can
be reasonably assumed to have a zero-marked Accusative.
The second property predicted for languages with anaphoric object agreement is thefunctional complementary distribution between the object marker and the independent object
pronouns (Bresnan and Mchombo 1987; 752). The anaphoric agreement marker refers only to an
established discourse topic, while the contrastive (replaced) topic must be introduced by other
means, namely, by independent pronouns, morphologically different from agreement markers. In
Chichewa independent pronouns in the object position are only interpreted contrastively (as
replaced topics), and a discourse-old topic in an object function is referred to by the anaphoric
object marker. In Ostyak independent personal pronouns also tend to be used contrastively, but
sometimes serve for non-contrastive anaphora. In example (191) the 3rd person object pronoun
lww-el in the last clause does not seem to bear the contrastive function since its controller can be
established without ambiguity in the relevant discourse.",[38]

Ostyak exhibits a rather high degree of morphological synthesis, so the inflectional
words usually have more than one morpheme. Theoretically, the nominal form may include at
most five morphemes (root, derivational affix, number, possessive, and case), and the verbal
form may include six or seven morphemes (root, two or three derivational affixes, tense,
voice, and agreement). In practice, however, such cases are rarely found; the noun normallycontains no more
morphemes.than three morphemes,while the verb contains no morethan fiveThe morphological structure is predominantly agglutinative. Typically, the words canbe easily divided into a linear sequence of distinct morphs, each of which has a regular shape
and a single function. Verb and nouns do not have morphonological classes (inflection types).
The agglutination, however, is not absolute. In some cases the boundaries between the
morphemes are not clear-cut, and several grammatical meanings may be combined within one‘portmanteau’ morpheme. For example, the affix -a expresses both 3SG subject agreement
and passive voice, and the affix -e:m expresses both 1SG subject agreement and SG object
agreement.
The overwhelming majority of affixes are suffixes. The only prefix is the prefix of
indefinite pronouns a:-. The so-called preverbs represent a category intermediate between a
free lexical item and a bound morpheme (see 2.2.6). Some function words (mostly focus
particle, see 2.3.2) are characterized as clitics. Clitics do not bear an independent phonological
stress but influence stress assignment patterns in the host word. Although synthesis
predominates in the expression of grammatical meanings, there are a few analytical
constructions: certain aspectual, temporal, and modal categories are formed with the auxiliary
verbs u:(l)- ‘be’ and pit- ‘start, fall’. Other widespread morphological processes are
compounding and conversion, while incorporation, reduplication, and paradigmatic sound
alternations are not typical. On incorporation see 5.4.
Themajoropenwordclasses(nouns,verbs,adjectives,andadverbs)are easilydistinguished by morphological and syntactic criteria, although in certain syntactic positions
they may have identical form and function. For example, nouns are formally and often
functionally indistinguishable from adjectives when they act as non-possessive prenominal
modifiers. Other word classes are: numerals, pronouns, and functional words (postpositions,
particles, and conjunctions).",[8]

2.3.1. Postpositions
Postpositions head a postpositional phrase and express a great variety of locational andnon-locational meanings. The object of the postposition is a noun (93a) or a pronoun (93b) in
the Nominative. If the object of the postposition corresponds to the personal pronoun, most
postpositions take agreement affixes identical to the personal affixes of nouns. The pronoun
must be overtly present in this case.

of its apparent local domain? This situation seems particularly odd because in a number of
languages which exhibit prenominal participial relative subject agreement the morphemeappears on the embedded predicate (participle) rather than on the head noun, and thus,
respects locality. This alternative pattern is, for example, typical of the closely related EasternOstyak, cf.

In should be noted that within the literature devoted to the typology of agreementpatterns (Lehmann 1982; Lapointe 1985;
Anderson 1992; Ferguson and Barlow 1988;
Corbett 1998) as well as in the existing typologies of relative clauses (Blake and Mallison1981; Lehmann 1984; Keenan 1985; Comrie 1989.) the pattern exhibited by (203) is
overlooked. However, apart from Ostyak, it is represented by a large variety of the languages
of Eurasia, namely in other Uralic languages Vogul (Skribnik and Kovgan 1991) and
Samojedic (Ubrjatova and Litvin 1986); in a number of Turkic languages, especially of the
Northem and Eastern groups (Ubriatova and Litvin 1986; Poceluevskij 1967; Kononov 1960;
Ubrjatova 1976); Western Armenian (Ackerman and Nikolaeva 1997); the Mongolian

the notion of anaphoric rather than grammatical agreement. As discussed in section 6.3.
above, the important terminological distinction between anaphoric and grammaticalagreement was made by Bresnan and Mchombo (1987) and maintained in other works within
the LFG framework (though this is not universally accepted, cf. Barlow (1992) and Corbett(1998)), Anaphoric agreement, as distinct from grammatical agreement, is an instance of long
distance dependencies and is therefore non-local by definition. It refers to the featurematching relationship between an incorporated pronoun serving to satisfy an argument
function directly governed by the head, and a coreferential free-standing element, typically in
the adjoined position. On this analysis, the possessive affixes on the head nouns in (203) have
a pronominal interpretation and satisfy the relative clause subject function, while the subject
pronoun within the relative clause is some kind of adjunct and as such is optional,occasionally in Tungus (Ubriatova and Litvin 1986). As far as I know, this pattern has not
been attested elsewhere, so it seems to be restricted to one geographical area, though a large
one. Formal accounts of this pattern can be found in Hale and Ning (1996) and Ackerman and
Nikolaeva (1997). I will not address them here, but note that although both accounts provide
reasonable representations for describing the central properties of the relevant constructions,
neither as presently formulated would seem to provide insight into why these structures are
the way they are. This is the question to which I will tum in the next section.
7.2. Relative clauses and possessives
As was mentioned in section 7.1, the subject agreement pattern is restricted to relative
clauses in which the subject corresponds to a pronominal NP. Thus, agreement in relative
clauses demonstrates the same split in marking as does the possessive construction. This is
illustrated again below. As in the case of the pronominal possessor, the pronominal subject
triggers person/number agreement on the head noun (209), and similarly to the lexical
possessor, the lexical subject does not trigger agreement (210).

‘the house John saw’Remarkably, in other languages exhibiting this relative clause construction, it is also
strikingly similar to the possessive NP. These similarities are summarized below.
(i) In all languages in question the possessive NP is strictly head-final, and so is therelative clause which exhibits subject agreement on the head noun. The corresponding
construction is not available for postnominal relatives, even if they are present in a language,
as for example, in Evenki and Samojedic.
(ii) The case marking of the possessor and the embedded subject is always identical.
Both constructions employ either only the Nominative (Vogul, and Yakut), or only the
Genitive (Mongolian languages and Western Armenian). In Turkic, Evenki and Samojedic theGenitive and the Nominative occur with equal frequency in both constructions, the latter
being restricted to certain special contexts.
(iii) Both possessive NPs and the relative clauses in question allow variations in headmarking, and the distribution of variants is similar. For some languages (Yakut, Evenki) both
constructions are always strictly head-marked. In most Turkic languages possessive affixes
may be optionally absent both on the head of the possessive NP and on the head of therelative clause, Other languages exhibit complementary distribution of the following type:
head-marking with the pronominal possessor/embedded subject vs. neutral or dependent
marking with the lexical possessor/embedded subject. Apart from Ostyak, this split is
observed in Western Armenian, Vogul, Samojedic, and marginally in Mongolian and Uzbek.
(iv) For all languages head-marking is strictly obligatory with the zero-pronominal as
possessor/embedded subject.
Given this apparent parallelism between two constructions, the question arises as to
why certain relative clauses should resemble possessives, especially since this appears to lead
to a violation concerning the locality of agreement/pronominal incorporation. The brief cross-linguistic comparison presented above shows that formal similarity between the possessive
construction and the relative clause with subject agreement attested in Ostyak does not
represent an accidental homonymy. The recurrent parallelism in form is likely to represent
some semantic and/or pragmatic similarity between two form (cf. Haiman 1985). In order tounderstand what is going on here it is important to discuss the categoriality, structure, and
semantics of ordinary possessive constructions.","[42, 43]"
"2.1.1.2, Case
The case system includes the unmarked Nominative, the Locative in -na and the
Translative. The affix of the Translative is -ji after a vowel and -Ci after a consonant-final
stem, where C assimilates to the stem-final consonant. Oblique cases are illustrated in (19).

Possessive NPs form two types of constructions, the neutral construction and the headmarked construction. When the possessor corresponds to a personal pronoun the dependency
relation is marked on the head noun by means of person/number affixes (on them see 2.1.1.3),
whereas the possessor remains unmarked and may be omitted (146a). Thus, within the
personal possessive construction the possessive marker encodes the internal constructionalrelationship, while the external syntax is encoded by the case or postpositional marking on thehead noun. On the other hand, the lexical possessor is merely juxtaposed to the head, which
does not bear any morphological marking of the possessive relationship (146b),(146)a.b.(ma)

"3. Basic syntax
Like most Uralic languages, Ostyak exhibits the typological features of a head-final
SOV language. However, the actual word order is largely influenced by information structure,
especially in an independent clause. Word order is addressed in detail in section 5. Nounphrases and postpositional phrases are rigidly head-final. Major grammatical relations, such
as the subject, direct object, and indirect object, are rather easily identified by a cluster of
grammatical properties. The case marking is based on the Accusative pattern for personal
pronouns, while for lexical NPs it can be characterized as neutral, since they lack an overt

3.1.1. Verbal clauses
In the intransitive clause the verb either does not take any arguments except for thesubject (one-place verbs), or it takes oblique object arguments. Oblique objects are typically
encoded as postpositional phrases, and only occasionally correspond to the Locative NP. Data

definite) interrogative pronouns with the postpositive particle a:nu/ or the prepositive particle
kus, for example: mosa a:tul ‘whatever’, kus xalfa ‘from wherever’, xojtaw a:tul ‘whoever’.
If a pronoun functions as prenominal modifier, the particle a:tul is placed after the head noun:o:mos-l-a-t
— sit-NPAST-EP-3PL‘Everybody is sitting.’Quantitative pro-adjectives typically precede the noun they modify but in certain
syntactic environments float in the postnominal position (see 6.1).
2.1.3. NumeralsCardinal numerals 1-8, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 are morphologically simple: if ‘one’
(non-attributiveform), ka:in ‘two’(non-attributive form), xu:/am‘three’, nil ‘four’, we:t‘five’, xut ‘six’, la:pet ‘seven’, nijal ‘eight’, ja:y ‘ten’, xus ‘twenty’, so:t ‘hundred’, Saras
‘thousand’. Numerals | and 2 additionally have attributive forms, i(j) and ka:t, respectively.
Other numerals are compound. The numeral ‘nine’ is derived from a bound component jar(unclear in meaning) and the numeral ‘ten’: jar-t'a:y. Numerals 11-17 are formed with the
suffix -xos- which goes back to the postposition xoSa ‘to, at’, for example: we:t-xos-ja:7
‘fifteen’ (from we-r ‘five’, and ja:y ‘ten’). Numerals 18 and 19 are formed as compounds with
the word xu:s ‘twenty’, for example: jijel-xu:s ‘18’ (from vijel ‘eight’). Tens involve the
numerals ja:y ‘ten’ or so:t ‘hundred’ as their second component, for example: we-t-ja:y
‘fifty’, but stijel-so:t ‘eighty’. Numerals ‘nineteen’ and ‘ninety’ involve the bound component
jar-, cf. jar-xus ‘nineteen’ and jar-so:t ‘ninety’. Numerals higher then 100 are formed by20combining the corresponding
conjunction pa ‘and’, cf.:

threeNumerals inflect for case and possession only within
a headless NP (see 3.5.2) or in the
predicative function (for possession). In the attributive
function they remain uninflected.
Ordinal numerals are derived with the suffix -mer
from cardinal numerals, for
example, we:t-mot ‘fifth’, riil-met ‘fourth’. Cf. also the
irregular ordinal numerals o:/oH ‘first’
and kimet ‘second’. For compound numerals the suffix
-met is added only to the last
component: xu-:lem-ja:y pa nil-met ‘thirty fourth’. Fraction
s are formed with ordinal numerals
and (optionally) the word su:p ‘part’, for example: (i) we:t-met
(su:p) ‘one fifth’.
For some numerals there are also morphologically distinct
distributive and collective
forms: kitemtak ‘both’, ka:taé ‘in two’. The Translative
of the ordinal numeral renders therepetitive meaning: xu:/-mat-ti ‘the third time’. The Locative
forms of the cardinal numeralshave distributive or temporal meaning: xu:/am-na ‘at three
(o’clock)’ or ‘by three, into three
parts’.
2.1.4. Adjectives
With regard to their inflectional properties, adjectives
are not distinguishable from
nouns. Like nouns, they are morphologically unmarked inasek following the adjective (39b). The superlative is formed with
the free-standing particle
met which need not be immediately adjacent to the (39c).
(39)xo: t-a-tso:ra_-xo:p
fast —_ boatmaydenote an abundance(40)a.log-li
se:m-li(41)Within a headless NP adjectives take other morphological markings
typical of nounsHowever, the syntactic distribution of adjectives differs from that
of nouns in at least
in two respects. First, unlike nouns, some parametric
adjectives may function as verbal
modifiers of manner. In this function they remain uninflected, for example:
so:ra.man-l
fast
go-NPAST.3SG
‘(he) walks fast’Second, adjectives participate in comparative and superlative construc
tions. The comparative
and superlative are formed analytically. In the comparative construc
tion the standard of
comparison is expressed by the postpositional phrase with
the postposition e:walt ‘from’
‘comparedwith’) while the adjectiveremains
unmarked (39a). The postpositional phrase which corresponds to
the standard of comparison
may either precede or follow the NP. The absolute comparative
is derived with the enclitic -meaning (40b),(40c), while -i sometimes‘without a snow’

"Ontopicalization of the possessor see section 5.2.
In constructions with multiple possessors, if the leftmost possessor corresponds to the
personal pronoun and the second and the third components of the construction stand in an
inalienable possession relationship to each other, the person/number affix may attach either to
the lower or to the higher head.

attributive nouns can be structurally analyzed as a subtype of the possessive construction,although its semantics deviates from the expression of possession. Like possessive modifiers,
non-possessive modifiers precede the head, for example: jam woj ‘nice bird’, so:rrii woj
‘golden (literally: gold) bird’, xu:/-mot iki ‘third husband’, tam xir ‘this sack’. To this type
also belong those NPs in which the head noun is semantically subservient to another concept,
so it cannot be used independently and requires modification. These are spatial nouns such asse:nkpal-atjux-o-tverytall-NOMtree-EP-PL‘very tall trees’

and non-specific pronouns are opposed only for the interrogatives ‘who’ and ‘what’. Specific
emphatic interrogatives are formed from non-specific interrogatives with the prefix a:-.
Interrogative pronouns are presented below.",[11]
"In sum, Ostyak does not display the clustering of properties predicted by Bresnan andMchombo for languages with anaphoric object agreement: it exhibits case government of the
object, agreement is local, independent pronouns are used topic-anaphorically, and the object
marker does not bear the fully specified set of noun features. Object ellipsis does not seem to
be a decisive argument in supporting or opposing anaphoric agreement. This implies that the
object marker in Ostyakagreement, as it is not entirely obvious whether relevant constructions are monoclausalormulticlausal. On the former analysis, they are monoclausal multipredicate constructions asanalyzed by Davies and Rosen (1988). But even in the latter case, under some assumptions theymight be viewed as the surface realization as a single clause of what consists underlyingly of
two separate clauses (the ‘clause union’ approach going back to Aissen and Perlmutter
(1983)). Independent of the approach taken, these cases do not apparently present a regular
instance of non-local object agreement in the sense suggested by Bresnan and Mchombo.",[39]
"0.2. Ostyak dialects
Compared with other Uralic tongues, Ostyak is remarkable for its great divergence ofdialects. At the extremes, the dialects demonstrate significant difference at all levels of
grammar and are entirely mutually incomprehensible. According to the variousBID ORTADDY Scns sce sesvscoxeraneeenseenntaences eee
Abbreviations .....classifications, there are from 5 to 14 dialects and within these a great number of local idioms.
An uncontroversial classification of dialects is difficult to establish, because, first, the Ostyak
language area is composed of a continuum of language variants and it is not possible to drawstrict borders between different local idioms (Vértes 1985; Schiefer 1985), and second, many
dialects are mixed in character (Steinitz 1937). The most commonly accepted classification,which goes back to Steinitz (1937), subdivides the Ostyak continuum into three major groups:
(i) eastern dialects (dialects of Vakh-Vasyugan, Surgut, and Salym);
(ii) southern dialects (dialects of Irtysh and Demyanka);(iii) northem dialects (dialects of middle-Ob, Kazym, Shuryshkary, and Obdorsk).
The dialects vary in their degree of preservation. The southern dialects and the dialect
of Salym have almost died out; there are no precise data about a number of surviving
speakers. The eastern dialects of Vakh-Vasyugan and Surgut are still spoken but are being
lost fairly quickly. The reason for this is that the eastern Ostyaks are more mixed ethnically4than those in the north, since their homeland is a place
of active industrial development, to
which the Russian population is attracted. Furthermore,
until recently the eastern Ostyaks
have not had writing and school teaching in Ostyak, thus
the standardization of the languagehas not occurred to the same degree as in the north. The best preserve
d are northern dialects,
which have always had more speakers and where the tradition of
the use of the language has
not
been broken. The northern dialects of Kazym and Shuryshkary
constitute a basis of the so-called Ostyak literary language, i.e. of the writing system, publishe
d materials, and school
teaching,Phonologically, eastern Ostyak is distinguished from northern
and southern Ostyak by
the presence of vowel harmony, by its rich system of the paradigm
atic vowel alternations, and
by more intricate vocalism in general. As shown in Steinitz
(1944), eastern Ostyak is the most
archaic from the phonological point of view and plays an importan
t role in the reconstruction
of Proto-Finno-Ugric phonology. The morphology of eastern
Ostyak possesses a more
complicated system of case marking (about 10-11 cases as distinct
from 3 or 4 in the northern
dialects) and of verbal tenses (6 as distinct from 3 in the
northern dialects). Syntactically, the
eastern dialects are characterized by the ergative construc
tion, which is completely absent
from the northern Ostyak dialects and the other Uralic language
s in general. The ergativeStrategy co-exists with the Accusative pattern, which makes the
eastern dialects the mostintriguing from the syntactic viewpoint.

2.2. Verbal morphology
Verbs function as finite and non-finite predicates. The finite verb has grammatical
categories of tense/mood/aspect, voice, subject agreement, and object agreement. Most non-Indicative moods are analytical. The general structure of the verbal form in the Indicative is as
follows:
(49)stem-tense-(passive)-(number of the object)-subject agreementThe verbal stems end in a single consonant (we:r- ‘make, do’) or a consonantal cluster
(re:sk- ‘hit’). Several verbal stems are vowel-final (ma- ‘give’, ji- ‘come, become’, tu:- take’,
wu- ‘bring, u:(1)- ‘be’), these exhibit some irregularities in conjugation.
2.2.1. ConjugationOstyak has obligatory subject agreement and optional object agreement. Intransitive
verbs inflect for subject agreement, that is, the person and number of the subject. This
paradigm is traditionally referred to as the subjective conjugation. Transitive verbs also
conjugate by the subjective type. In addition, they have the second paradigm, which is24traditionally referred to as the objective conjugation. The latter exhibits
both subject and
object agreement. The verb in the objective conjugation takes an affix referring to
the number
of the direct object followed by the subject agreement affix, as shown by the diagrams
in (50).
The subject agreement markers in the two conjugations are phonologically different.
(50)a.subjective conjugation (intransitive and transitive verbs):stem - tense - subject agreementb.subjective conjugation (transitive verbs only):

The following modal categories are distinguished:
(i) The Indicative. The Indicative is morphologically unmarked and is realized through
tense forms (see 2.2.2.2). The Indicative may denote the irrealis modality if combined with
modal particles such as ki ‘if. The Non-Past Indicative may have a deliberative meaning:
(51)maThus, transitive verbs are used either in the subjective or in the objective
conjugation. Theconditions on the use of object agreement (the objective conjugation) for transitive verbs
areaddressed in more detail in section 6.

suggested in the translation in (216b). Recall that, like nouns, participles can take a possessive
and case marking when they form a complement or adverbial embeddedclause, and likeadjectives, they can be nominalized with the nominalizer -f. Being a mixed category,
participles are the best candidates for a lexical elaboration of the associative relation between
two nouns within the possessive construction: on the one hand, they retain the argument
structure and the cooccurrence abilities of the verb; on the other hand, they can serve as
modifiers for a noun.

consequently, the reinterpretation of the modified possessive construction as a relative clause,
that is, the change from stage II to stage III,
This change is accompanied by a change in the constituent structure. The participle is
reanalyzed as a single constituent with the subject of the relative clause. This is revealed bythe modificational construction. Participles in Ostyak behave as verbs with respect to their(217)(ma)my

The use of the possessive affix here is not required by anytype) occurred. This is equivalent, on average, to one possessive genitive every 54 words. Forfor the corpus analyzed.
The unusually high frequency of (associative) possessives in Ostyak is due to the fact
that associative possessives are in fact the only way to express the relationship between two
nouns. The possible relationships reflect all the various ways in which (inanimate) objects are
typically associated with other inanimate objects, such as purpose, source, place, and
modification. The exact interpretation of the relationship being conveyed is largely
determined by the nature of the entities involved, and therefore by the semantics of the
corresponding nouns. In European languages the corresponding relationships can be rendered
through the prepositional phrase with the preposition ‘for’ (212a), by modification by other
postpositional phrases (212b), by juxtaposition (212c), or by relational adjectives (212d).representgrammatical considerations; its removal would not lead to ungrammaticality and seems not to

By contrast, in the following group of examples thewhile lexical and ownership possessives are comparable in frequency with those in Englishand other European languages, the associative possessives are unusually frequent. This is
confirmed by the following statistics. Taylor (1991) has analyzed the corpus of English textsjux ke:si

In the traditional literature on Ostyak (Honti 1984, among others) the possessive
affixes in (213) are said to express the definiteness of the corresponding NP. This seems
partly true, since its referent is usually identifiable through the possessive relationship with
another entity, typically definite as well. However, definiteness as such cannot predict thechoice amongvariouspossessive affixes (Ist person vs, 2ndpersonvs. 3rd person).",[44]
"In a number of formal syntactic theories, this reflects the local specifier-head syntactic
configuration (Mahajan 1989; Koopman and Sportiche 1991; Chomsky and Lasnik 1993;
Chomsky 1995), while other approaches justify locality in semantic terms (Keenan 1978:
Gazdar et. al 1985). Crucially, the head nominal is not a constituent of the relative. This ismost readily apparent in the fact that it bears the case or postpositional marking appropriate to
its role in a domain external to the relative and participates in the form of predicate agreementordinarily associated with a simple nominalbearing the same relation within a clause. Itfollows from this that the person/number marker is likewise external to the relative. Examples(207a) and (207b) illustrate the subject and the object agreement triggered by the head
nominal in the matrix clause, while (207c) shows case marking on the head nouns.

"The same pattern is observed with the relativized possessor. In this case the possessed noun ispresent within the relative clause and bears the possessive affix cross-referencing thepossessor (via;wre:m-l-al in example (202), cf. the original possessive construction ike:-t
na:wre:m-l-al ‘the children of the old men’). However, the relative clause subject does nottrigger any agreement itself.
(202)As mentioned in section 3.3.2.2, Ostyak makes use of prenominal participial relative
clauses. They are based on the so-called gap relativization strategy (Comrie 1989: 151-53),

clauses (7.1), a motivation for it (7.2 and 7.3), and its possible diachronic development (7.3).
7.1. Agreement within the relative clauseSubject agreement patterns within relative clauses in Ostyak fall into two major types.
First, agreement may be altogether absent. As demonstrated by (201) relative clauses with a
subject gap do not exhibit agreement. In particular, since in passive relative clauses only the
subject can be relativized, agreement fails. This is shown in (201b) where the Locative case
on the NP which corresponds to the agent argument indicates that the relative clause is
passive.

verbal stem with the affix -man, for example: na:wer-man ‘jumping, we:r-man ‘making,
doing’. It has three major functions: first, it participates in the analytical Stative (see 2.2.2.3);
second, it forms the embedded adverbial clause of manner or concomitant action, and third, itforms secondary resultatives (see 3.3.2.2).
The Infinitive is formed with the suffix -ri(i), for example: we:r-ti(ji) ‘to make, to do’.
The suffix -fi is homonymous with the marker of the Non-Past participle and goes back to it
historically. The component -ji represents a frozen Translative case affix. However, in themodern language the Infinitive differs from the Non-Past participle both formally and
functionally. As distinct from the participles, the Infinitive is morphologically unchangeable:
it does not take agreement affixes and cannot be combined with case markers (for example,
the Locative) or postpositions. The Infinitive acts in certain adverbial and complement clauses
and typically indicate the coreference between the matrix and the embedded clause subjects,
see (3.3.2.2). As was discussed in 2.2.2.2, it also participate in the analytical Future.
Ostyak has two participles that express he category of relative tense: the Non-Past
participle in -fi and the Past participle in -m, as well as the Negative participle. Participles
have a variety of functions. The Non-Past and Past participles serve as prenominal modifiers
(see section 7), as a predicate in complement and adverbial dependent clauses (see 3.3.2.2),
and as a final predicate in the Evidential (see section 8). In the latter two functions they take
subject agreement affixes which go back to the possessive affixes but differ from themphonologically. Below I present the conjugation of the Past participle of the verb we:r- ‘make,
do’; Non-Past participles inflect for person/number in a similar way.",[19]
"In dialogues or in a story addressed to a particular person the 2nd person possessive may
encode the situational relationship between the entity and the listener. For example, (215) can
be produced when looking at several moving cars. The car is “yours” because I am talking to
you about it, although you do not own it and are not associated with it in any other ways.

In sum, I have demonstrated that Ostyak makes excessive use of associative
possessives, i.e. possessive constructions which indicate some kind of situationally
determined relationship between two entities. This is also true of other languages which
exhibit relative clause subject agreement of the type exemplified in (203). In the next section Iwill discuss how this correlates with the Ostyak relative clause pattern.not contain an explicit expression of relation between the possessor and the possessum, while
in the latter the additional information about the actual referent of the head noun is overt. This
has a semantic and a morphosyntactic consequence. The semantic consequence is that, asmentioned above, the nature of the relation between the possessee and the possessor in thepossessive construction is lexically indeterminate, and often supplied by the context. The
morphosyntactic consequence is that since the relation between two entities is not lexically
expressed the person/number marking cannot appear on it: instead, it appears on the nominal
head of the construction. The person/number markers here serve as markers of a construction-internal relation mediated through a covert predicate of which the possessor is the subject. In
contrast, in relative clauses the relation between the subject and the head noun is expressed
overtly by a verbal form, namely, the participle. The latter effectively provides a lexical
restriction on the sort of relation which exists between the arguments expressed by the headnominal and its subject argument. The participle supplies a lexical specification of relation
and is an overt relational element which can in principle serve as host for an agreement
morpheme. As was mentioned in section 7.1, in some languages it does in fact host the
possessive affix. However, in Northern Ostyak and some other languages the possessive affix
rather appears on the head nominal.
Seen from this perspective, it is possible to interpret the relative clauses in question as
a type of possessive construction, specifically, one in which the morphosyntax of possessive
constructions remains intact, while the somewhat indeterminate relational semantics intrinsic
to possessive constructions is lexically specified by the participle. Convergence between the
possessive construction and the relative clause is based on their functional parallelism. From
the formal point of view, it represents an example of constructional syncretism or homonymy
motivated by economy considerations, namely, paradigmatic economy in the sense of Haiman
(1985). The purpose of the paradigmatic-economic motivation is to minimize the inventory of
signs within a system through subsuming several related meanings under a single form.
Taking into account constructional similarity, the emergence of the relative clauses in
question can be represented diachronically through the following three hypothetical stages.

requires that a language have certain forms of expression for various grammatical phenomena.
In particular, it must exhibit a head-marking strategy for its nominal possessive constructions
and a high frequency of associative possessives. This implicational relation provides a clue
concerning the motivation for these comparatively unusual relative constructions. I suggest
here that head-marked associative possessives represent a semantic constructional source for
relative clauses in Ostyak.",[45]

ent with structural position: the
object that does not trigger agreement is analyzed
as VP-internal, and the object that triggers
agreement as VP-external. The VP-external status
of the object is accounted for by various
syntactic mechanisms associated with semantic effects
(Mahajan 1989, 1991; Diesing 1992;
Georgopoulos 1991, 1992; Diesing and Jelinek 1993;
Woolford 1995; among others). Certain
semantic features of the object (such as specificity,
definiteness, humanness, and animacy)
condition its lack of abstract Case (De Hoop 1992),
its particular phrasal scope properties
(Diesing 1992; Runner 1995), or, under the minima
list assumptions, a strong Case feature in
the agreement phrase (Chomsky 1995). In some langua
ges this forces the object to be overtly
excluded from the VP and be moved to (or
generated in) the VP-external position. In
languages without object agreement this merely results
in the so-called ‘scrambling’ or object
shift (Webelhuth 1992; de Hoop 1992; Holmberg
and Platzack 1995; Vikner 1995: 97-100,
and references therein), while in languages with
overt agreement morphology the object
triggers agreement from that position. As we have
seen, Ostyak conforms to the crosslinguistic data in that the object that does not trigger
agreement forms a constituent with the
verb. This object will be further referred to as
VP-intemal, and the object that triggers
agreement as VP-exteral.
The next question then is, which syntactic position
is associated with the object that
triggers agreement. Current syntactic theories provide
different positions for the VP-external
object, either Spec of VP (Georgopoulos) or under
the more recent approach Spec of AgrO
(Woolford; Mahajan; Chomsky). However, the object
that does not trigger agreement is
located fairly freely in Ostyak, so the approach which
relies on movement to a particular
position would have to make additional claims explai
ning the difference between various
word orders. The free position of the VP-external
object in some
through the mechanism of (topic)-adjunction to any maximal projection languages is captured
outside the VP rather7170than placementto a particular category (Bresnan and Mchombo1987; Choi1996). Thismechanism seems to account for the word order facts in Ostyak as well.
6.3. Argument structureThissectionexploreswhethertwotypesof objectsdifferin their argumentrelationship to the predicate.
Since the object that does not trigger agreement is apparently syntactically inert, it might be
thought to be identified with the non-terms (adjuncts) which are known to have limited syntactic
activity. However, an important, perhaps definitional, feature of adjuncts is that they are notsubcategorized for by a lexical head, and therefore can in principle be removed without being
anaphorically controlled and without affecting well-formedness. In other words, adjuncts crosslinguistically license the non-specific null word with an existential or universal interpretation. For
example, as in a large family of languages, in Ostyak the passive agent adjuncts license non-specific
null words, see examples (77). Crucially, unlike regular non-terms, the object that does not trigger
agreement must be overtly present in the clause. As shown by (185b), sentences with the subjective
transitive verb without an overt object are strictly ungrammatical. This immediately qualifies the
object that does not trigger agreement as different from regular adjuncts.
As was shown above, the object that does not trigger agreement has limited term
properties. Furthermore, it demonstrates a great degree of fusion with the verb, in the sense that it
must follow the adjacency requirement and cannot be suppressed in clause structure (in that it
differs from adjuncts). This may suggest an incorporation analysis for them. Although not
every syntactically inert element presents an instance of noun incorporation, every incorporated
element is characterized by the absence or at least the reduction of syntactic activity. The
description of the object that does not trigger agreement as an incorporated noun is indirectlyconfirmed by the fact that the co-occurring subjective verb has fewer surface transitive features
than the objective verb, because the object is not marked on the verbal form, so does not differ
formally from an intransitive verb. This, in principle, might suggest an analysis whereby the
object undergoes incorporation altering the argument structure (detransitivization).
However, in section 5.4 I have analyzed the reduced complements. They were shownto have syntactic properties that make them different from other elements, including the
object that does not trigger agreement. In particular, unlike the object, they do not passivize,
do not relativize, cannot be modified and questioned separately from the verb. This suggests
that reduced complements are characterized by greater fusion with the verb and more apparent
syntactic inertness than the object that does not trigger agreement. Notice also that in complex
predicates the ‘objecthood’ of a reduced complement is suppressed, which is overtly expressed
by its Locative marking as opposed to the Nominative/Accusative marking of the object that
does not trigger agreement. These syntactic properties make reduced complements better
candidates for incorporation analysis than the object. Consequently, an object that does not
trigger agreement cannot be analyzed either as an adjunct or as an incorporated element, and
must be identified as an argument.
A further question is the argument status of the object that triggers agreement. Since it
is anaphorically referred to by the verb and can be absent from the clause, one might expectand therefore satisfies the argument structure of the verb. When the overt object is present in
addition to the object marker, it cannot bear the argument function due to the LFG functional
uniqueness principle, which prohibits the same function being assigned twice. The occurrence
of such an object inside the VP is blocked by the object marker because only arguments can
appear in the local domain of the verb, so the object that triggers agreement must be generated
VP-externally. The anaphoric relationship between the object marker and such an object isidentified as anaphoric agreement. Thus, the minimal difference between the anaphoric and
grammaticalliesinargumentthevalueof theagreementmorpheme:theargument relationship to the predicate.","[37, 38]"
"Relative clauses in general exhibit a functional similarity to possessive constructions.
From a gross semantic perspective it is obviously the case that both constructions express
modification. Taylor (1989, 1995) convincingly argues that possessive constructions serve to
identify one entity by invoking some kind of relation with another entity, see also Langacker
(1993) and the discussion in the previous section. This follows from the fact that the most
important property of the prototypical possessive relation is its exclusivity: at a given time aStage I represents an example of a canonical associative possessive. The noun ‘book’
is not intrinsically relational, therefore when it heads the possessive phrase the relation8687receives an extrinsic interpretation. As mentioned in section 7.2, the default extrinsic
interpretation is that of ownership, however in an appropriate context alternative
interpretations, such as those in (216a), may arise. They are characterized as associative
because they express some kind of association between ‘book’ and its ‘possessor’. In section7.2structure formally parallels the constituent structure representation of the possessive
construction, where the head nominal is modified by an adjective or a noun, as in (218).
(218)a.[have argued that such associative possessives are widely used in Ostyak.
As was argued above, the meaning of the associative relation between two entities isnot expressed within the possessive construction, which is open to multiple interpretationsb.depending on context and pragmatic factors. The possessive phrase in (216a) entails somekind of situational relation between the possessor and the possessed, without specifying it
lexically. So, some predicate of relation is necessarily involved in the interpretation of
associative possessives (cf. Seiler 1983a: 40) and the possessor functions are its subject. Thepredicate remains covert within the possessive constructions. However, this relation is
entailed by the possessive construction, and can therefore in principle be expressed within a
separate predication. Stage II, as represented in (216b), is a lexical elaboration of such apredication. It is carried out through insertion of a verb that explicitly describes the
relationship between two nouns, cf. Seiler (1983b: 91): “If a verb intervenes between the two{nouns}, its only purpose is to make explicit the particular mode of the possessive
relationship.” At this stage the relation between the possessor/subject and head noun is
mediated overtly by a verbal form, namely, the participle which effectively provides a lexical
restriction on the sort of relation between them. Thus, the change from stage I to stage II
represents a lexical disambiguation of the relationship that holds between the components of
the associative possessive construction.
A question that arises at this point is why the verb that intervenes between two nouns
and describes the nature of the associative relation between them takes the participial form.","[45, 46]"

2.1.5. Adverbs
In most cases verbal modification is expressed by morphologically unmarked
adjectives (see 2.1.4). There are only a few manner adverbs that are morphologically
distinct
from the adjective, for example, the following adverbs are derived from adjectives:
jam-o-§
‘well’ (from jam ‘good, nice’), a:tm-e-§ ‘badly’ (from a:tem ‘bad’), ku:n-tat ‘easily’
(fromku:n ‘easy’), ta:k-an ‘tight’ (from ta:k ‘tight’), as well as the adverbs
derivedfromtheTranslative forms of adjectives, such as so:ra-ji ‘for a short time’ and kwt-ni
‘easily’.
Examples of non-derived manner adverbs which do not have a corresponding adjective
are:
ta:keliji ‘in vain’ and sukap ‘quietly.’
Spatial adverbs are typically distributed among three fairly regular series with
the
Locative, Lative, and Ablative meaning, for example:2322gloss

Examples of degree adverbs are: talayti ‘wholly, as a whole’, a:r(tan) ‘much’, jesa‘little’, mort ‘enough’, se:yk ‘very’, and wulli ‘completely’. The degree adverb meaning may
be rendered by some logical particles (see 2.3.2) or preverbs (see 2.2.6).
Manner adverbs and certain spatial and temporal adverbsformtheanalyticalcomparative and superlative, identical to that of adjectives (see 2.1.4). For example, the
absolute comparative may be formed with the clitic -sak added to the adverb itself, or to the
postposition within the periphrastic adverbial expression:

various forms and denote orientation in space, for example: jam pe:lekna ‘from the right
side’, parta pe:lkes ‘to the left’, nim pe:lek e:welt ‘from the north’.
Most temporal adverbs are represented by frozen Locative or Nominative forms of
nouns,a.wait-NPP-NOMN‘wolfNominalized adjectives and participles function within a headless NP or a headless relative
clause, respectively, and inflect as regular nouns (see 3.5.2).
The Diminutive is derived by means of the productive suffix -ji preceded by theepenthetic /i/ when attached to the consonant-final stem, cf. pe:rna-ji ‘little cross’ but xo:t-i-ji
‘little house’, The Diminutive often has an affectionate rather than a purely diminutive
meaning. In this function it is very commonly used in folklore, where it can co-occur not onlywith nouns but also with adjectives (a:j-i-ji ‘very small’), personal pronouns (nay-i-ji ‘you’),
and postpositions (joxan xuwa:t-i-ji ‘along the river’).
Furthermore, Ostyak has a number of bound words that always follow a noun andserve as its semantic modifiers. These words are phonologically independent of the preceding
noun, but semantically and syntactically function as categorizing morphemes. They are
exemplified below.

word at ‘thing’. This nominalizer attaches to the fully derived word. Forexample, according to the regular phonotactic rule of Ostyak (1.3.2), if the base adjective or
participle ends in two consonants the epenthetic @ is inserted between them. In further
derivation the nominalizer -f in its turn is preceded by another epenthetic o; thus, the resultingform is, for example, man-o-m-a-t ‘the one who went’ (from man- ‘go’, -m Past participle)
instead of *man-m-a-t which would normally be expected. This suggests that the nominalizer
-f, although bound to its host, is outside the phonological word and can be identified as a
clitic. Examples (44a) illustrate the substantivization of adjectives, while examples (44b)
show the substantivization of participles.","[13, 14]"

"Next, according to Bresnan and Mchombo, anaphoric agreement is present when the
agreement marker bears a fully specified set of features, which cannot be duplicated by the
overt NP with the same set of features. This explains the complementary distribution of theagreement and the overt object in Chichewa, where the object marker bears all the nounfeatures relevant in the language. The Ostyak object marker, although it marks the number ofthe object, does not specify its person (as independent pronouns do). Because the objectmarker does not supply all the necessary referential features of the object, they must bespecified elsewhere. This conditions the presence of the overt object NP, which is not
incompatible with the object marker in Ostyak. So Ostyak is different from Chichewa and, if
this argument of Bresnan and Mchombo is valid, exhibits grammatical rather than anaphoric
object agreement.
Finally, languages with pronominalincorporation are predicted to have anaphoricdeletion in the object position as a natural consequence of the fact that the object marker bears
the object function (Bresnan and Mchombo 1987: 765). However, this property by itself doesreference and argumentfunction,and can bethe verb between the object that triggers agreement and the object that does not. Although theobject that does not triggers agreement fails to retain some term properties, it cannot be identified
as a non-term because, unlike clear non-terms, it is not optional. On the other hand, in a number
of syntactic effects the object that does not trigger agreement differs from incorporated elements
or at least demonstrates a lower degree of fusion with the verb than the undoubtedly incorporated
nouns. This leads to the conclusion that the object that does not trigger agreement is a verbal
argument and does not form a compound predicate with the verb, but rather a higher level
constituent, arguably a VP. On the other hand, in constructions with object agreement, the object
marker cannot be viewed as an incorporated pronoun, so the object itself must bear an argument
function.agreement with the object of the subordinate clause is encoded on certain auxiliary-like matrixverbs (for a similar phenomenon in Hungarian see Ackerman 1987: 341-50; Farkas and Sadock
1989: 326-27). However, this does not constitute a strong argument in favor of anaphoriclacks pronominalcharacterized as a simple grammatical agreement morpheme. Consequently, the object that
triggers agreement must be analyzed as a verbal argument.
The tests used in this section reveal the absence of difference in argument relationship to6.4. Information structureWe are left with the conclusion that object properties in Ostyak can split between the VPinternalandVP-extemalpositionswithoutaffectingthe truth-conditionalmeaningof thesentence and the argument structure of the predicate. This situation argues for an information
structure motivation of object agreement. The principal claim of this section is that agreement is
motivated by information structure rather than semantic considerations,
An object that does not trigger agreement is associated with the information structure
relation of focus. Focus is defined here as the “the semantic component of a pragmatically
structured proposition whereby the assertion differs from the presupposition” (Lambrecht 1994:
213). Focus serves to add new information to already existing knowledge, and therefore makes
an utterance into an assertion. The focus status of an object that does not trigger agreement is
supported by the following considerations.
(i) The linear position of the object that does not trigger agreement is the same as of the
other focus elements (5.3), that is, it must be strictly preverbal. The only lexical material that can
intervene between the object and the verb in this case are elements that do not represent a
separate information structure constituent (see 6.2).
(ii) In questions and answers to the object the verb must be in the subjective conjugation,
i.e., object agreement is absent, cf.:7574(194)mati

kill-EP-PAST.3SG“Which reindeer did he kill? He killed THIS reindeer.’Since the wh-question words are known to exhibit a universal syntactic and functional
association with focus, this supports the focus analysis of the object of the subjective verb.
(iii) The definition of focus cited above suggests that focus is associated with newinformation, therefore the relation between the focus referent and the proposition is
unpredictable. For this reason, focus, unlike topic, must be overtly expressed in a sentence. This
is true with respect to the object that does not trigger agreement which cannot be omitted fromOn the other hand, discourse-old concepts are usually realized as an unstressed pronoun,
an anaphoric affix, or a zero anaphora (Givén 1983; Ariel 1988; Gundel et al. 1993), although
they may be referred to by a lexical NP as well. The object that triggers agreement tends to bediscourse-old; and, as was argued above, it does not need to be overtly present in the clause, that
is, it may correspond to the anaphoric null, Furthermore, inherently old objects, such as, for
example, reflexive objects, always trigger agreement. Recall from section 2.1.2.1 that Ostyak
lacks reflexive pronouns and reflexive possessive affixes, while ordinary personal pronouns and
possessive affixes may have a reflexive function. The contrast presented in (197) demonstrates
that object agreement can be the only formal marker of reflexivity: example (197a), as distinct
from (197b), has a reflexive reading.","[39, 40]"

analyzed within the Lexical-Functional grammar (LFG) framework by Bresnan and
Mchombo (1987), which has revealed numerous similarities to Ostyak.
As in Ostyak, in Chichewa object agreement is optional. Inside the VP the object NP
and the object marker are distributed complementarily. In the presence of the object marker
the object must be generated VP-externally in an adjoined topic position, while the VPinternal object does not trigger agreement. The crucial distinction is further made between
two object types with respect to their argument relationship to the predicate. The basic
suggestion is that the object marker is an incorporated pronoun that has a referential functionagreementgrammatical agreement marker, unlike the anaphoric agreement marker, does not bear anclosehave-INFasatallstart-PAST-SG.3PL*So he was caressing his animals.

‘Peter hit him/it/*himself.’linguistically empty pronouns or implicit arguments are quite commonly independent ofagreement (cf. Rizzi 1986). Null objects are found in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese,The topic-anaphoric role of independent pronouns is inconsistent with anaphoric agreement
under the theory suggested by Bresnan and Mchombo, and indicates the grammatical character
of object agreement in Ostyak.
Even more importantis thatanaphoricagreementasdistinctfromgrammaticalagreement is predicted to be non-local, i.e. it can carry over between elements of distinct simple
clauses. The reasoning supporting this claim is that the arguments must be expressed within the
phrase structures headed by the predicate, be marked on the predicate itself, or otherwise remain
unexpressed and be anaphorically controlled by non-local elements (Bresnan and Mchombo
1987: 752). Verbs agree grammatically only with their governable arguments, so grammaticalagreement must be structurally local. In contrast, the antecedent of the anaphoric relationship is
not related to the argument position by government, therefore there is no requirement for it to be
structurally local to the verb, as is the case in Chichewa object agreement.","[38, 39]"

"ThisThe attribute may be located either before the embedded subject, that is, arguably before the
relative clause if it is a demonstrative (221), or immediately before the head noun and after
the participle, that is, arguably after the relative clause (222). This shows that the relative
clause constitutes a single syntactic constituent, unlike the combination of possessor and
modifier within the possessive construction.

possessive constructions. As I argued in this section, the structure of the Ostyakrelativeclauses is motivated by a constructional similarity and diachronic relationship to head-marked
associative possessives. Given this, relative clauses in questions can be interpreted as a
variant of the same pattern, Rather than exhibiting a different kind of agreement, they are
simply a marked instances of grammatical agreement/pronominal incorporation found in
regular possessive constructions containing incorporated pronouns. Their markedness consistsin their violatingthe usuallocalityconditionongrammaticalagreement/pronominalincorporation. The details of formal analysis of non-local agreement of the kind addressed
here still have to be worked out; such an analysis may ultimately lead to a reconsideration ofthe usual syntactic assumptions concerning locality of agreement. My purpose here was to
provide a functional motivation for the relevant phenomena, that is, to justify why the relative
clause constructions in Ostyak appear the way they do.
8. Evidentials
Ostyak exhibits a grammaticalized system of Evidentials. Evidentials are formed withPast (-m) or Non-Past (-fi) participles in the finite position inflected for subject agreement (on
agreement affixes of participles see 2.2.5). Accordingly, the Evidential shows a temporal
distinction between Past and Non-Past similar to that in the Indicative. The Analytical Future
Evidential is possible but extremely rare; it is formed with the Infinitive of the content verb
followed by Non-Past Evidential form of the auxiliary verb pif- ‘fall; start’.","[46, 47]"
"The same is observed with other clause-external topics, namely adverbial scene-setting
expressions, including the adverbial embedded clause. These elements are left-dislocated and
precede the clause-internal subject topic, for example:(160)a.o:mes-!

grammatical reasons—as in the case of the possessor or certain adverbial elements—it is the
topic rather than the subject that is expected to be sentence-initial.",[32]

The Resultative use of the Evidential emerges when the speaker could not witness the

If the time of the reported event coincides with the moment of speech, such an event cannot have
a result from the point of view of the speaker because the situation of result presupposes at least a
minimal time difference between it and the event that caused it. So if the verb is in the Non-Past

Transitive verbs take at least two arguments: a subject and a direct object. The direct

pronouns. As will be discussed in section 6 below, the grammatical relation of the direct
object in Ostyak is split into two syntactic units with different grammatical properties

Temporal categories exist only in the Indicative and Evidential. Ostyak does not have
relative tenses, but distinguishes the Non-Past, the Past, and the Future. In the Indicative the
Non-Past tense is represented by the marker -/-, the Past tense is represented by the marker -s,
and the Future is analytical. On temporal categories in the Evidential see section 8.
The Non-Past refers to the moment of speech, expresses the universal situation, or
(immediate) future, for example: man-l-o-m ‘I am going, I (usually) go, I will go’ (go +
NPAST + EP + 1SG)’. It can also be used as the narrative past, especially in folklore texts.
The Past tense refers to the situation in the past: man-s-a-m ‘I went, I was going, I had gone’
(go + PAST + EP + 1SG). The Analytical Future is formed with the Non-Past form of the
auxiliary verb pif- ‘fall, start’ inflected for subject and (optionally) object agreement and the(57)an
NEG.",[16]
"In the comitative NP the head noun is modified by the postpostional phrase headed by
the postposition pil na ‘with’. Such a postpositional phrase usually follows the head, so headfinality here is violated. In the subject position the comitative NP triggers Dual agreement on
the main verb (151a). Note that the postpositional phrase headed by the postposition pil ‘namay also have an adverbial function. In the latter case the main verbs take the Singular
agreement (151b),
(151)ab.",[29]
"Indeed, the data from different languages shows the overlap between Evidentials and epistemic
meanings (Willett 1988: 55), and indicates they may have a common origin (Anderson 1986:
308-311; Traugott 1989, and others). Palmer (1986) also suggested that evidentials and
epistemics may be in a compleimentary distribution across languages. Some languages, such as
English, emphasize the judgmental system (the expression of possibility and necessity); others
emphasize the purely evidential system (as do many native American languages); some
languages combine both (such as German). This account seems to be supported by the Uralic
languages. Note that Ostyak has very little—if any—grammaticalized means to express
epistemics other than by the use of the Evidential itself. This also applies to most other Uralic
languages for which Evidentials have been reported, such as Vogul, Zyryen, Cheremis,98Votyak, Nenets (Serebrennikov 1960: 58-66, 80-82, 118-120, 122, 126, 132, 160-167, 171-172, 176-178), as well as Yukaghir.
However, the semantics I have described here indicate one important difference between
Evidentials and epistemics (cf. Chung and Timberlake1986; Oswalt 1986: 43). As was saidabove, Epistemics deal with the degree to which the speaker is convinced that the proposition is
true. Evidentials, on the other hand, have nothing to do with the commitment of the speaker to
the truth of the proposition but merely indicate the grounds for the assertion. With such an
understanding, Evidentials do not evaluate the truth-value of the proposition with the notion of
possible worlds, as do epistemics. The propositions asserted in the Evidential are asserted as
necessarily true from the point of view of the speaker and as referring to the actual world. In a
sense they are even “more” true than the propositions asserted with the Indicative, cf. their use inoral folklore which was traditionally treated as presenting knowledge of the world that was
absolutely true. This makes the Evidential a category which strictly speaking stands outside the
field of epistemic modality.","[51, 52]"

"PART I: Essentials of Ostyak grammar0. Introductory remarks
0.1. Geo- and sociolinguistic dataThe Ostyak language, together with Vogul and Hungarian, belongs to the Ugric groupof the Uralic language family. The closest linguistic relatives of the Ostyaks are the Voguls,
with whom they form the so-called Ob-Ugric subgroup within the Ugric group. The official
modern name of the Ostyaks in Russian is Khanty, which goes back to their self-designation.",[4]

This againsubject in Ostyak systematically corresponds to the topic function, in conformance with thewell-known cross-linguistic tendency. The following arguments support this claim.

"Under Taylor's account, due to their internal semantic structure, relational nouns, such as
body parts or kinship terms, represent permanent or inalienable possession which exhibits the
whole cluster of independent possessive properties. Therefore they receive a default
possessive interpretation within the possessive construction. On the other hand, possessive
constructions involving non-relational nouns are open to multiple interpretations. When all
the prototypical properties are present, the construction has the ownership interpretation, for
example, John's house in the meaning ‘the house that John owns’. But since the prototype is a
complex cluster of properties, it allows various deviations, and that is how contextually
determined meanings arise. That John's house is semantically indeterminate, in contrast to
John's wife, is due to the fact that house, unlike wife, is not intrinsically relational. Its
semantic structure is such that there is no exclusive candidate for elaboration by the possessor
nominal.
For my purpose it is enough to assume here a fairly general semantic classification of
possessives. The classification given below is partly based on Barker (1995). Barker’s main
insight, going back to Chomsky (1972), is that the semantic and syntactic behavior of
possessives is largely determined by the nature of the possessed noun. This stands in
agreement with Taylor's account mentioned above. Barker distinguished between “lexical
possession” where the semantic interpretation is determined by the meaning associated with a
relational head noun (understood as such both grammatically, as two-place predicates, and
conceptually), on the one hand, and “extrinsic possession” involving non-relational nouns
(one-place predicates), on the other hand. In the latter case the possessive relation does not
depend on any inherent semantic properties of the possessed noun and allows for various
readings. I will further refine Barker's classification and speak about two basic realizations of8283extrinsic possession, the ownership meaning and the non-ownership or “associative” meaning.d.","[43, 44]"
"2.3.2. Particles and conjunctions
On functional grounds, particles can be divided into grammatical particles, logical
items, and extra-clausal discourse particles. Grammatical particles participate in derivational
and inflectional processes. These are the comparative clitic -sek, the superlative particle me:t
(see 2.1.4), particles whichformthe free-choiceindefinite pronounsa:tul and kus (see2.1.2.5), particles which form the oblique verbal moods a:t and /u:/on (see 2.2.2.1), as well as
negative particples (see 2.2.3). Note that the particle me.t can have a spatial noun or an
ordinal numeral in its scope:
(97)me:t o:len
me:t la:pet-met‘the very beginning’
‘the very last seventh’Logical particles express various logical relationships and can sometimes have
adverbial force, that is, function as degree adverbs. The most frequent logical particles are:
wus ‘already’, xolna ‘also, too, more’, pa ‘and, again; another; also’, a:/ ‘very much’, Sax‘completely’, isipa ‘in any case’, Si ‘finally, still; also, too’, xof ‘almost’, and isi ‘same’. If alogical particle takes scope over the predicate it is typically immediately adjacent to it and
precedes it (98a), while if it takes scope over an NP it typically follows it (98b).",[21]
