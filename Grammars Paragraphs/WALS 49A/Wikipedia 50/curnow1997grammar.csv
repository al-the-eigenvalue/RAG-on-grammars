"However expected combinations of the Accusative postposition or the possessive
postposition with pronouns do not occur.
The possessive 1narker pa is not used together with the first, second and
third person personal pronouns (it is used together with the interrogative personal pronoun min 'w ho'). Rather, there are special possessive adjectives instead
( see 4.4 .5 for details). However, these ~orms are not n1erely suppletive forms ,
but rather a quite separate item, as the possessive adjectives may be used predicatively, while a postpositional phrase of possession may not be used in this
way:(210)a.n yal=na
ap ka-y
this house ==T OP n1y be:permanently-N o NLOC UT
' This house is 1nine. '(211) *anshutta Santos=pa
1
this hat
Santos==POSS be.(NON LO CUT)When a singular personal pronoun is being used as an Object or Second
Object , there are special suppletive Accusative pronoun forms, rather than simply
using the Nominative singular pronoun followed by the Accusative postposition.
In the case of plural personal pronouns, the Nominative form is used, together
with a special Accusative clitic, distinct from the Accusative postposition. For
further details and a full listing of these Accusative pronominal fonns, see section 4.3.3.",[155]
"5.4Postpositio11al pl1rasesPostpositional phrases are formed in Awa Pit using a variety of postpositions (for
a full list, see Table 4.10). Postpositions have an important role in the language,
as they are often used to mark the relations which particular NPs bear to the
predicate. In addition to PPs being used as con1plen1ents and adjuncts to verbs,
however, they may also be used within NPs and other PPs. Postpositions follow an
NP or another PP, and cli ticize onto the word which precedes them. In addition,
postpositions n1ay be used following a clause ( see section 10. 2. 3. 2 for details).
At a theoretical level, the postpositions and postpositional phrases of Awa
Pit n1ay be divided into a number of types. For example, in n1any theories of
grammar the Accusative marker would be treated as a case marker, a grammatical
item with no meaning, while other postpositions would be considered to be true
adpositions, full and complete words with their own semantic structure. In some
more recent work, however, this explicit dichotomy has been questioned (see,
for example, Kumashiro (1994), who discusses the case marker versus adposition
problem in Japanese).
It is clear that in Awa Pit there is some difference between the Accusative
marker, which can show the grammatical relations of Object and Second Object
and marks a variety of semantic roles, and other postpositions, which do not
mark gran1matical relations but rather explicitly mark semantic roles. However
at a formal n1orphosyntactic level all postpositions behave in the san1e fashion,
with the exception of suppletive forms being used for Object pronouns and possessive pronouns, and consequently after a brief discussion of the combination of
pronouns and postpositions, all postpositions will be treated in the same fashion.",[154]
"3.5.1A, S a11d O syntactic functio11sThe basic syntactic functions of A, s and o used in this work are defined according
to Andrews (1985). If an NP argu1nent of a verb with two or more NP arguments3.5. SYNTACTIC FUf'lCTIONS A1VD GRA1\!Ilv[ATICAL REL.ATIONS6:3is acting n1orphologically and syntactically identically to the Agent argument of
a Primary Transitive Verb (such as ' kill '), it is considered to have the syntactic
function A. If it is acting morphologically and syntactically identically to the
Patient of such a verb, it is said to have the syntactic function o. If an NP
in an intransitive sentence is being accorded the n1orphological and syntactic
treatn1ent normally given to the single argument of a one-argument predicate , it
is considered to have the syntactic function s.
The son1ewhat more restrictive definitions of A, sand o given by Andrews
(1985) are being adopted, rather than those of Dixon (1994), to avoid some serious
theoretical concerns . Dixon considers that the single argume-n t of any intransitive
verb is an s, and the two arguments of any transitive verb are A and o. However
there are languages which have a very small number of verbs requiring their
arguments to take unusual case marking. For example , in Modern Icelandic
there are a few intransitive verbs which have their single argument case-marked
in the same way as transitive objects are normally marked (Andrews 1985:102).
In Dixon's systen1, we would then be required to consider Modern Icelandic to
be a spli t-s language, as the single argument of an in transitive verb (always an
S following Dixon's definition) can be marked in more than one way; in fact , it
would be a four-way split-s language , as there are also a few verbs which require
their single argument to be in dative or genitive case. Clearly, however, we wish to
consider Icelandic a non1inati ve-accusati ve language , with ·a very few verbs with
unusual case-marking requiren1ents , quite different from a split-s language such
as Dakota, where it is not possible to make a generalization over the entire system
of intransit ive verbs , but rather there are two different systen1s operating. If we
establish definit ions whereby a language such as Icelandic is a split-s language ,
it then becomes necessary to consider further splits such as the 'sp lit-o ' systen1
of Gern1an, where a few transitive verbs (s uch as helpen 'help') have their non-A
argun1ent marked in the dative rather than the accusative, and so on.
Equally, there are problems with considering A and O to be defined as the
two argurnents of any transitive verb - it is unclear what exactly is a transitive
verb. Dixon (1994:6) simply says that clauses involving ""a verb and two or more
core NPs"" is a transitive clause. If a core NP is defined as A, Soro, we have a
circular definition . If a core NP is not defined this way, it is unclear whether, across
languages , there is an appropriate definition of core NPs. Following Andrews 's
(1985) definition, it ~Nill be suggested that Copula Complen1ents in Awa Pit are
core arguments, and in this case copula clauses contain two core arguments but we would not wish to consider these clauses as transitive in many languages ,
including Avl/a Pit. To avoid these problems, Andrews's (1985) more restrictive
definitions of A, s and o will be used here.","[83, 84]"
"1241CHAPTER 5. NPS, PPS AND COPULA CO!VIPLE1VIENTSThe ""plural possessive adjectives"" provide a slightly peculiar exception to
the above regularity. Singular possessive adjectives occur in the expected slot,
and descriptive adjectives may occur between the possessive adjective and the
head noun:
(164)ap katsa til
kuzhu
my big
black pig
'my big black pig'However as noted in section 4.4.5 there are no special plural possessive adjective
forms. In order to translate a phrase such as our house, speakers of Awa Pit have
two options. The more common option is to simply use the singular possessive
adjective:
(165)ap yal
my house
'my house, our house'The alternative, with no apparent difference of meaning, is to use the plural
Subject pronoun, unchanged, in the bare noun n1odifier slot:
(166)au yal
we house
'our house'In this case no adjectives can intervene between the pronoun and the following
noun.
It could perhaps be 111aintained that the difference between singular and
plural ""possessive adjective"" constructions is related to 'individuation', in the
sense of Hopper & Thompson (1980:253). Pronominal referents which are human, singular and referential - the more individuated nominals - take one
position , while those which are non-singular occur in a different position. In
this case, however, a distinction would need to be drawn between the way the
language treats 'individuation' in possession with pronouns (where singular and
plural are distinguished by position) and nouns ( where unmarked nouns with
plural reference are treated identically to unmarked nouns with singular reference). A distinction would also need to be drawn between the treatment of
""possessive adjectives"" (where entities which are singular, human and referential
are distinguished from others) and Accusative 111arking ( where entities which are
hu111an and referential, whether singular or plural, are distinguished from others).
On the whole it seems more sensible to simply consider that there is a
""gap"" in the language, a lack of plural possessive adjectives, and that the speakers
make up for this gap either by using a singular possessive adjective or a plural
Subject pronoun in the bare noun modifier position, rather than attempt to find
a theoretical explanation.
In the following sections the various functions of the pa-postposi tional
construction, the possessive adjective construction and the bare noun modifier5.2.","[144, 145, 146]"
"3.5.5Core, oblique a11d external fu11ctionsAndrews (1985:80-82) establishes three distinct types of syntactic functions. He
first distinguishes between external and internal functions, with the former not
actually forming a part of the basic clause structure and never bearing any specific
semantic role. The internal functions in turn can be divided into two types, core
and oblique. 'The distinction between core and oblique functions is a little less
distinct, being very much language-dependent. Core functions always include
A, S and o, and any other syntactic functions which are similar in behaviour
to these. The core functions cornmonly correspond to 'syntactic cases' ( that
is, those cases which express a wide variety of sernantic roles) , while oblique
functions correspond to 'sen1antic cases' ( those cases which tend to have a more
or less one-to-one correspondence with semantic roles).
In Awa Pit, there is a clearly identifiable external function - the external
topic. Those N Ps which fill this position do not form a part of the basic clause
on phonological grounds, nor are they specifically related to any semantic role in
the clause with which they appear. 27
Subject, Object and Second Object quite clearly cover syntactic functions
which are core, and can be considered core grarnmatical relations. Subject and
Object are used to code A, s and o, and consequently are core by definition. The
Second Object grammatical relation is very similar to the Object grammatical
relation, suggesting that it is probably core, and there is supporting evidence
for this. The Second Object is involved in a minor way in syntactic processes,
being necessary for causativization, where the Second Object of a causativized
transitive or di transitive corresponds to the Object of the non-causativized verb.
The Copula Con1plement should also be considered a core grammatical
relation. While there is less evidence for this, the Copula Complement does
have distinctive syntactic properties - it cannot be ellipsed and appears to form
part of the predicate, and may consist of an adjective phrase as well as noun
phrases, postpositional phrases and subordinate clauses - and it codes a variety
26 Neitherof these conditions actually holds for the second argument of the stative twoargument verb pyan ' know'.

For further details on the external topic, see section 14.2.",[99]
"4.6Postpositio11sPostpositions play a very important role in Awa Pit. As a language without a
case-suffix system (except for the pronouns), Awa Pit relies very strongly on its
postpositions to indicate the relations which noun phrases may play in a sentence.
Many postpositions are also used following non-finite clauses, essentially creating
constructions similar to English subordinating conj unctions.
The Awa Pit postpositions are listed in Table 4.10, together with an ap11
proximate English gloss. These postpositions are never independent words, but
rather cliticize onto the preceding word, which is usually, but not always, the final
11 Forbelow.a possible exception to this statement, see exa111ple ( 133) and associated discussion4.6. POSTPOSITI0 1\TS105word of an NP or another postposi tion. Cli ticized postpositions are quite comn1on
in Amazonian languages to the east of Awa Pit (Doris Payne 1990b:220); and to
the west, Epena Pedee has a system of case marking through postpositions very
similar to Awa Pit , with the postpositions attaching to clauses as well as NPs
(Harms 1994:65-79). A sin1ilar situation holds in Ika, spoken in northern Colombia, where locative postpositions can cliticize onto clauses (Frank 1990:102-103).
The initial phoneme of the postpositions undergo the usual within-word
phonetic realizations, with the exception of those beginning with /p/, which
becomes / w / after a vowel - as discussed in section 2. 2.1, this is the case for all
morpheme-initial /p/ after a vowel. This is clear evidence that the postpositions
forn1 one phonological word with the preceding element.
Grammatically, however, there is a different situation. While previous
analyses of Awa Pit have considered the postpositions to be nominal suffixes
( Cal vache Duenas 1989, 0 ban do Ordonez 1992), there are clear reasons for analyzing then1 as separate grammatical words ( clitics) rather than parts of the
preceding word (suffixes), although not all types of evidence are found with all
postpositions.
First, many of the postpositions (all those which have some relation to
location) have been found following other postpositions. This is not so unusual
in those cases where the first post position is the genitive postposition pa ( as
in example ( 124)), as sequences of two noun suffixes have been found in other
languages when the first is a genitive; but n1any also occur with one locational
postposition following another, as in exa.n1ple (125) :
( 124)Santos=pa=mal
nya.
waa-y
Santos==POSS==LOC meat there:is-NONLOCUT
'There is meat at Santos's [place].'","[125, 126]"
"5.2.2""Reflexives""Awa Pit does not have a specific reflexive construction; however the techniques
used to convey the notion of reflexivity are more closely related to a nominal
reflexive system than a verbal one such as is found in Imbabura Quechua (Cole
1985: 134-135).
Reflexive situations are reported in a variety of ways in Awa Pit, with
two being the most common. With non-third person, there is always the option
of simply including separate Nominative and Accusative pronouns referring to
the same person, and the same structure is sometimes used for third person as
well, although then there is ambiguity between reflexive and non-reflexive; this
same sort of system, with the an1biguity present, is used in a few other South
An1erican languages such as Piraha (Everett 1986:215-217). In this case, and5.2.","[137, 138]"

suffixes, wa for first and second person, a for third person and the interrogative
person pronoun. As these forms are obligatorily attached to the personal pronouns, and no material n1ay intervene between the pronoun and the Accusative
n1arker, they are considered suffixes rather than clitics. Another possibility would
be to consider the con1bination of pronoun and Accusative marker as a su ppleti ve
forn1, but the repetition of the same forms for n1ore than one personal pronoun
( wa for two pronouns, a for two pronouns), and the fact that the fonn of the
Nominative personal pronouns occurs in the Accusative form, suggest that an
analysis of these forms as Accusative suffixes is more appropriate.
The plural personal pronouns have special Accusative clitics, which attach
to the final elen1ent of an Object NP containing a plural personal pronoun, not
necessarily directly to the personal pronouns themselves. Normally the only
elen1ent in an NP containing a personal pronoun is the personal pronoun itself,
as no n1odifiers except numerals are permitted in such an NP. However, when
nun1erals do cooccur with (plural) personal pronouns, they follow the pronoun
( as in (83)), whereas numerals precede nouns ( as in (82)). Thus if a personal
pronoun with a numeral is used in Object relation, the Accusative clitic occurs
on the numeral rather than the pronoun itself ( as can be seen in (84)).","[106, 107]"

Typologically, Awa Pit also appears to be much more Andean than coastal
or Amazonian. There are many typological similarities between all three groups,
but certain differences. The closest Amazonian languages tend to have highly
complex classifier systems (Doris Payne 1990b:220), completely absent from Awa
Pit, and a much more polysynthetic structure (Doris Payne 1990b:214). While
all languages in the region tend towards cliticized postpositions for case n1arking,
there are relatively few postpositions in many Amazonian languages. Coastal
languages such as Epena Pedee are ergative-absolutive (Harms 1994:9-10); while
Awa Pit, Quechua and many languages on the Amazon side of the Andes are
nominative-accusative and have similar case systems. Indeed, many of the case
forms given by Levinsohn (1976) for Inga Quechua appear similar or identical to
those of Awa Pit: an accusative and locative ta; a genitive pa; and a locative
meaning encoded by mal in Awa Pit versus ma in Inga Quechua. Unfortunately,
there is no evidence of lexical similarities, apart from a few words which are likely
to be loans (Inga Quechua forms first): 'father' (tayta, taytta), 'cattle' (huagra,
wakata [wayara]), 'gun' (illapa, iyaIJpa), and so on.","[38, 39]"
"3.5.2SubjectAwa Pit is a non1inati ve-accusati ve language, both morphologically and synactically: as will be shown in this section, NPs in A function and those in S
function act in the same \,vay, both morphologically and syntactically, and dif-64CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTUREfer from N Ps in o function. 9 It is thus possible to establish the grammatical
relation of Subject, which covers all N Ps in A and S function and a number of
others, since A and s have been defined restrictively. vVith the exception of
zero-argument verbs, every verb in Awa Pit is subcategorized for a Subject.
The morphological and syntactic tests given below are applicable to all N Ps
in A function, and all N Ps in s function which are arguments of active verbs. 10
Unfortunately, while the morphological tests used to show the identity of s and
A all work for active verbs ( though with minor differences in the case of nun1ber
marking), the majority of syntactic tests are not applicable for clauses involving
stative verbs - the stative verbs simply cannot be used in these constructions.
The evidence for considering that arguments of stative verbs are Subjects
comes from three sources. The majority of stative verbs have, in fact, only one
argument, by definition s, and thus this argument is a Subject. This is not,
however, particularly convincing. Morphologically and syntactically, one of the
arguments of a stative verb acts in precisely the same fashion as an A or s of an
active verb - in tenns of constituent order, case marking, controlling number
marking ( with differences) and person marking. There is one syntactic test for
Subject which can be used with stative verbs, the same-Subject purposive.
The gram1natical relation of Subject covers a variety of semantic roles,
such as volitional agent (ayna- 'cook'), non-volitional agent (kwata- 'von1it'),
patient (kwaa- 'drown', jiJJ- 'ripen'), experiencer (jzh- 'see') and possessor (mij
'have').
3.5.2.1Constituent orderThe first piece of evidence for a Subject gram1natical relation comes from constituent order. In the n1ost basic clause ordering ( discussed in section 3.2), only
one constituent occurs before any adjuncts. This constituent is A or s, when one
of these is present in a clause, and hence any constituent which occurs within a
clause before adjuncts is the Subject.
3.5.2.2Case n1arkingThe system of case marking used in Awa Pit is relatively transparent. It is 'analytic' rather than 'synthetic' (Blake 1994:10), as the relationship between dependent arguments and their verbal heads is expressed through cliticized postpositions
rather than case inflections; however the same information is being offered as is
offered through case inflection, and the use of particles or adpositions to express
the syntactic function of arguments is well known (Dixon 1994:41-42).
In Awa Pit, the case-marking system is nominative-accusative, with A
and S being 1narked in the same fashion, distinctly from o. N Ps which are in A
9In the following discussion, "" NPs in o function"" will often be referred to. In fact, in the
analysis given here, many of these ""N Ps"" are actually PPs, as the Accusative marker ta is
considered to be a postposition. However the somewhat sloppy wording is used to avoid a
constant use of ""NPs or PPs"".
10
See sect ion 4.5 for the important active/ stative distinction in Awa Pit verbs.","[84, 85]"
"VERB DERIVATLON A1VD VALENCY CHANGESprefixes"" found in Uto-Aztecan languages, where ""a body-part term ... signals
the instrument by which the action of the verb is realized"", as in Pipil tan-kwa'bit' fron1 tan- 'tooth' and kwa- 'eat' (Campbell 1985:96). This appears to be an
example of Mi thun 's ( 1984) Type II incorporation; however unlike her Type II,
this incorporation does not affect the arguments (Subject==agent, Object==patient
in both cases), but rather incorporates an instrun1ental adjunct.
While these few compound verbs with the first part identical to a noun
may be treated as noun incorporation, it is clear that the phenomenon extends
well beyond this in Awa Pit, with ""incorporation"" of nouns, adjectives and various
unknown elements. As the process is non-productive except for the use of Spanish
verbs, which are clearly not noun incorporation, these verbs have sin1ply been
called compound verbs, ignoring the various processes by which the compounds
may have been formed.
6.3.3.4Loan verbsAs noted a number of times in the previous sections, there is one case in which
co1npound verbs are formed in a fully productive fashion: when Spanish verbs
are used in Awa Pit. Spanish words from most word classes can be used in Awa
Pit with no change (beyond phonetic/ phonological alignment), as Awa Pit has
almost no morphology, except for verbs. However when a speaker wishes to use
a verb fro1n Spanish, the verb is put into a compound structure with ki- 'do~
happen', and this second element can then carry the morphology. The Spanish
verb itself is placed in its most basic forn1, the third person singular present
indicative form. Thus from the Spanish trabajar 'work', an Awa Pit verb trabaja
ki- 'work' may be formed, or frorn con tar 'count' comes cuenta ki- 'count'.
This process of forn1ing con1pound verbs fron1 non-native words through
the use of an ""auxiliary"" verb n1eaning ' do' can be con1pared in an interesting way
with similar constructions in a number of other languages. 7 Japanese appears
to have a sin1ilar construction using the verb suru ' do' - thus doraibu-suru is
formed from English drive (Hinds 1986:371-2). It must be noted, however, that
this construction is only used with foreign loan nouns, not verbs; and the hyphen
presumably indicates that these two elements can never be separated.
Clearer parallels are with Indian languages, whether Dravidian ( such as
Tamil) or Indo-European (such as Panjabi). In the majority of these languages
there are a series of complex verbs, formed by combining an element such as a
noun, verb or adjective with some sort of auxiliary, most commonly 'do'. Bilingual Panjabi-English speakers in Birmingham have taken advantage of this
construction (Ron1aine 1985), and often use lexical i terns ( usually verbs) from
English, followed by the auxiliary k8rna ' do'. While it is not clear from Romaine's discussion of Panjabi whether the resulting compound is a single word or
7 \Vhile only examples of languages using an ""auxiliary"" verb 'do' will be looked at here , thereare other ways of achieving the same ends. For example, Warlpiri has a productive system of
compound verbs, and English loan verbs are entered into the language using this pattern (Bavin
& Shopen 1985:82); however as cases such as these do not involve a verb meaning 'do ', they
will not be discussed here .",[177]

other referential human non1inals form a possessive using the postposition pa (see
section 5.4.8). The human interrogative/ negative pronoun min ' who ' forn1s a possessive in this usual fashion; however the non-interrogative personal pronouns do
not have possessive forms in this sense, but rather uses the su ppleti ve possessive
adjectives for the singular pronouns, and either the singular possessive adjective
or the bare plural personal pronoun itself for the plural case (see section 4.4.5).
More information on the non-interrogative personal pronouns is found in
section 5.2; the interrogative/ negative personal pronouns are discussed in sections 12.2.1 and 12.2.2.","[107, 108]"
"This indicates that there must be two noun phrases, in apposition, as the Topic
1narker and case marking can only be marked once on each noun phrase within
the sentence.
Agentive nominalizations are clearly quite close semantically to relative
clauses. However they do not, in fact, comply with the conditions set by many
definitions of relative clauses, as there is no domain noun which is further restricted by a subordinate clause. Even when the ""domain noun"" is explicitly
expressed, it is placed in apposition to the nominalization, and thus is not in
the same noun phrase. This construction is thus not a relative clause according
to the definitions of I{eenan & Comrie ( 1977) or Comrie ( 1981), which both require a domain noun in the same noun phrase as the restrictive clause. I{eenan
(1985:142), on the other hand, takes the defining feature of relative clauses to
be the presence of a restrictive clause, and considers that a do1nain noun is not
necessary in a relative clause construction - and under this definition, this construction is perhaps a relative clause, although the use of identical 1norphology
on acljecti ves is somewhat disturbing in this case. 20
There are a variety of languages where a nominalization functions as a
""relative clause"" n1odifying a head noun. For exa1nple, Davis (1973:211) gives the
following sentence fron1 Luiserio, where the presence of locative 1narking on the
verb 'make' shows it has been nominalized:(718)I(u?a·l-up nive?-qa
wfw-IJa
nU-SI]aki pu-lo?xa-IJa
fly-PRES
be:in-PRES acorn:mush-LOC my-wife her-make-LOC'There is a fly in the acorn mush my wife n1ade.'
While this exa1nple is not structurally identical to the Awa Pit no1ninalizations
with an apposed noun (for example, in Luiseiio the possessive prefix nu is only
possible on nouns), there are clear similarities, with the ""head noun"" and the
nominalization both separately case marked. In fact, all elements of an NP in
Luiseiio are normally case-marked, however in addition to this, while the ""head
noun"" is usually found immediately before the nominalization, this is not necessarily the case, and the two elements can be found in a variety of places through
the sentence (Davis 1973:206). It is thus not entirely clear whether the head noun
and the nominalization in Luiseiio are in the same NP or in apposition.
In their discussion of nominalizations being used as ""relative clauses"", Comrie & Thon1pson (1985) make the following comments which are highly relevant
to Awa Pit:

however they are clearly distinct ( see previous section for details). These two

"CH}lPTER 8. PERSON MARI{ING198these intransitive verbs now taking w by analogy with the many intransitive
verbs which have an agent as their single argument. This would, in fact, make
the postulated ""original"" system very similar to the northern Colombian language
Ika, which has a basically nominative/ accusative cross-referencing system, but a
very small group of about twelve intransitive verbs cross-reference their subjects
in the same way as transitive verbs cross-reference their objects (Frank 1990:22);
the Ika system is, however, a cross-referencing system, with the person marking
only used to mark participants.
Of course it could be considered that a change in the system is a response
of semi-speakers acting under the influence of a largely nominative/ accusative
system in Awa Pit and a completely nominative/ accusative system in Spanish.
There are two reasons to reject this analysis, one language-internal and one theoretical. Language-internally it is clear that the system of 1narking is very unusual
in itself, and there seems to be no reason to assun1e that this apparent additional
peculiarity is in any way a language death phenomenon, rather than simply a
fact of the system. And while the evidence fro1n changing case-marking systen1s
in language death situations is rather scanty, this phenomenon has been studied
for Dyirbal, where an originally ergative system is replaced by accusative marking (Schmidt 1985a, Schmidt 1985b ). In this case, however, individuals were not
found to be varying from one form to another, but rather ""each individual was
highly consistent in his / her response"" (Schmidt 1985a:382) as to the form and use
of ergative marking. This contrasts markedly with the Awa Pit situation, where
the san1e speaker alternates between one form and another. The situations are
slightly different, of course , in that in the hypothesized ""original"" Awa Pit system there are only a few verbs with unusual 111arking, while in Dyirbal an entire
structural system is altering.
For the moment the precise synchronic and historical value of these Awa
Pit 1narkers will be left open. The possibility that these alternations between
s and w are inherent to the system will be taken up again when this system is
compared with similar syste1ns in other languages and in discussing the origin
of the system, where it will be seen that the alternation is a likely synchronic
outcome of a potential historical change.","[218, 219]"
"NPS, PPS AND COPULA COMPLEl'vfENTSPurposive adjectivizationsThe adjectivizer suffix mu has a number of functions, and one of these is to
form a nominal modifier from a transitive verb, indicating that the noun being
n1odified ""is (good) for Verb-ing"" or ""is to be Verb-ed"". The noun is necessarily
something which could fill the Object slot of the mu-marked verb. \Nhen used
attributively rather than predicatively, the mu-n1arked verb follows the noun it
1nodifies as deverbal adjectives do, rather than preceding it like lexical adjectives. The only examples of an attributive use of purposive adjectivizations which
have been found are together with the verb waa 'there is', which is intransitive. Consequently it is not clear where case marking postpositions would occur
with a noun modified by a purposive adjectivization. However, given the parallels with the deverbal adjectives, it appears likely that the noun and a following
mu-marked verb form one noun phrase.",[143]
"3.5.3Object and Second ObjectAs well as the gran11natical relation of Subject, two grammatical relat ions have
to be established to cover the syntactic function o and related functions: these
are the grammatical relations of Object and of Second Object. Once again,
to establish these gramn1atical relations it would be better to rely on syntactic
rather than morphological criteria. Indeed, of the two morphological processes
involving o, case n1arking gives very unclear results about a grammatical relation
of Obj ect, while number marking is slightly better.
Unfortunately, there is relatively little syntactic evidence for Object and
Second Object in Awa Pit. Given the lack of a passive construction in Awa Pit ,
there are only three syntactic constructions which clearly involve O: the Serial
Verb construction, the Resultative, and the use of zha, the First Person Object
Imperative form. The first two of these cannot be used to establish which of the
non-Subject arguments of ditransitive verbs should be considered o , for different
reasons. The Serial Verb construction (see section 11.5) requires that both verbs
in the construction have the same referents for all grammatical relations, but
unfortunately also requires the verbs involved to have the same transitivity hence it is impossible to con1bine a transitive and a di transitive verb to discover
which argument of the ditransitive verb corresponds to the o of the transitive
verb . The Resultative construction (section 11.2.2.2) with transitive verbs has
an S which corresponds to an o of a verb in a non-Resultative form; however theCHAPTER 3. _BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTURE72Resultative construction is only possible with verbs expressing a change of state,
and there are no ditransitive verbs which fall in this semantic class. Hence the
only syntactic construction which can be used to examine which of the two nonSubject arguments of a ditransitive verb is in o function is the zha construction,
and this will be discussed following the morphological evidence.
3.5.3.1Case 111arkingThe case-marking system of Awa Pit is nominative-accusative, as was shown in
section 3.5.2. The Subject of a sentence is always unn1arked for case, while an
o 1nay be marked. In general, as was shown in the examples in that section, a
referential hun1an NP is 1narked as Accusative in o function while other NPs in
this function are unn1arked.
Marking only referential human NPs in O function with Accusative marking, while leaving others unmarked, is not uncommon in the languages of the
world. 19 It could, in theory, lead to confusion about whether a particular unmarked non-human NP is in o function or not. In fact, it is usually clear from
context or semantics that a particular non-human referent is, or is not, in O
function. If ambiguity ren1ains, it is al ways possible to use explicit NPs for both
participants, and rely on the usual constituent order, with A preceding o, to
disan1biguate the syntactic functions:(60)ku-m
pitikku
ishu==na.
eat-ADJ ZR
tiger==TO P sloth
0 (not ref. human) V
A
'Tigers eat sloths.'","[92, 93]"
"As in the case of English in the above translation, some of these relational
nouns are transparently related to nouns or adjectives. For example, the relational noun used in the above example, isal, is cross-classified as a noun meaning
'top', and can be used without a following locative postposition in the same
""whole-part"" construction:
(88)mesa isal=na
natam izh-ma-t=na
table top==TOP yellow see-COMP-PFPART==TOP
' The top of the table is yellow (in appearance).'",[109]
"5.2.4""Possessive"" co11structionsWhile the semantics of the ""dedicated"" modifiers within the NP - such as the
descriptive adjectives and the quantifiers - is relatively straightforward, the
sen1antics of the ""possessive"" construction needs closer examination.
The ""possessive"" construction can be used to encode a wide range of functions: location-object, whole-part, 1naterial-object, and meanings similar to
English co1nplex prepositions, which are encoded through the use of relational
nouns. Many of these functions have been found cross-linguistically to be coded
similarly to possession,3 and indeed in Awa Pit some of the above functions can
also be marked in the same way as possession, either through the use of the
possessive postposition pa (see 5.4.8), or through the possessive adjectives.
In some cases, however , there is an alternation between a PP with pa, a
possessive adjective, and a bare noun modifier, where the bare noun acting as a
modifer must occur directly before the noun it 1nodifies. The alternation between
these constructions can be seen to depend on humanness and referentiality. 4 If
3See , for example, Ultan (1978b:28-35).
' Referential ' here is not used to imply the logical idea of 'existence in son1e world ', but rather
is used in the sense Giv6n (1982:84) gives it , where a referential noun is one whose "" specific
identity is i1nportant"" rather than ""its generic type membership"" (emphasis in original) . Hopper
& Thompson (1984:711) prefer the label 'manipulable ' to 'referential'.
45.2. NOUN PHRASES123the modifying noun is human and referential, the postpositional construction is
used (or a possessive adjective, if the non-head entity is pronominal); otherwise
a bare noun modifier is used:(158)Santos==papimpulSantos== POSS leg
'Santos's leg',,iJ:11(159)appimpulmy leg
'my leg'1IiIfi

[unlikely]'
(162)awapitperson language/ tongue
'the language of the people (Awa Pit) [n1ost likely] ; human tongues
[unlikely]'
Once this di vision between hurnan, referential entities (expressed through
the postpositional or possessive adjective constructions) and other entities (expressed through a bare noun n1oclifier) has been drawn for those functions where
the constructions are in alternation, it is possible to see that this distinction underlies all uses of the constructions, and in fact explains why some functions are
necessarily expressed by one construction or the other.
For example, the ideas of alienable possession and kinship relations necessarily involve the use of the postpositional or possessive adjective constructions
( with the exception of ""plural possessive adjectives"", see below), rather than a
bare noun modifier. However this follows from the semantics: alienable possession and kinship are inherently characteristics of referential humans. In those
few cases where the idea of possession or relation are expanded to include higher
animates, Awa Pit personifies the entity in question, treating it like a human:
( 163)kwizha== wa pelota
dog==POSS ball
'the clog's ball'Equally, in those constructions which encode the relations of location-object ,
unit-mass, material- object and purpose-object, the first entity is necessarily
either non-human or non-referential, and consequently the postpositional and
possessive acljecti ve constructions cannot be used.","[143, 144]"
"As seen in these examples, a nominalized clause as Subject is usually Topicmarked, as is common for lexical Subjects. While these clausal nominalizations
are most often used in Subject role, they can be used in other roles, and in
this case the nominalization is followed by appropriate postpositions to mark the
grammatical role:
(709)na==na
[ pishkatu pay-nin-tu==mika
] ==ta
1SG.(NOM)==TOP [ fish
buy-CAUS-IMPF==NMLZR.SG ]==ACC
pyan-ta-w
hit-PAST-LOCUT:SU BJ'I hit the one who was selling fish.'
These clauses are clearly nominalizations rather than, for example, complement clauses , as the nominalization can be accompanied by modifiers such as
adjectives at the level of the matrix clause in exactly the same way as any lexical
noun:
(710)sun
that[ a-t==mika
] ==na
ii-ma-ti
[ co1ne-PFPART==NMLZR.SG ]==TOP die-COMP-TERM'That one that came has died.'
Thus the clause forms the functional equivalent of a noun, not a noun phrase.
Given that in Awa Pit it is possible to ellipse a head noun, it could be
I)1aintained that the clauses marked with mika or tuz are in fact modifiers rather
than nouns in their own right, and that the head noun has been ellipsed. Indeed,
there are sentences which contain both a mika/tuz clause and a noun, which
would appear to support this analysis:

"4.4.1Disti11guisl1i11g adjectives fro111 non1i11alsAs in many other languages, such as Imbabura Quechua (Cole 1985:73), no1ninals and adjectives are morphologically similar in Awa Pit. In addition, both
nominals and adjectives can appear as the only element in an NP (with the exception of demonstrative adjectives), as modifiers of an NP head (with the exception
of demonstrative pronouns, time and place nouns, relational nouns and some
personal pronouns), and as predicates ( with the exception of demonstrative pronouns, demonstrative adjectives and some personal pronouns). Despite these
similarities in distribution, it is possible to distinguish nominals from adjectives.
To begin with, there are two series of demonstratives. Demonstrative
pronouns n1ay only occur as the heads of NPs, while demonstrative adjectives
may only 1nodify NP heads. Additionally, there are different interrogatives for
questioning nominals and adjectives: min 'who ' or shi 'w hat ' for nominals, versus
min 'which' for adjectives.",[111]
"118CHAPTER 5. NPS, PPS A-ND COPULA COMPLEMENTSIt does not include deverbal adjectives or purposive adjectives, modification by
nouns , or modification of adjectives. For negation of elements within an NP, see
section 12.6.
Of the nominals which can be heads of NPs, only the nouns can be modified
in this way. As was noted in section 4.3.3, personal pronouns can only be modified
by quantifiers, and in this case the quantifier appears after the pronoun rather
than before: au kutnya 'we three'. Other nominals - time and place nouns,
demonstrative pronouns and relational nouns - cannot be modified at all.
Where it is semantically plausible, quantifiers and descriptive adjectives
themselves ~an be modified by the degree adverbs kwisha and pina or by the
comparative marker an, as can the head noun. These constructions are discussed
and exemplified in sections 13.6 and 13. 7 respectively.
Not all postpositional phrases can occur within an NP. Those which have
been found are possessive ( discussed at length below), locational and similarity
PPs.

The correspondences for underived and derived transitive verbs are thus:
(296)Underived
Subject
Object¢==}
¢==}Derived
Subject ( causer)
Object
Second ObjectIn earlier work on causativization (for example , Con1rie 1975, Comrie
1981 ), the focus was on the ""paradigm case"" of 111orphological causativization,
whereby the Subject of the underived verb corresponds to the Indirect Object of
the derived verb in the causativization of a transitive verb. Cases such as that of
Awa Pit were 111erely considered as ""doubling on direct object"" (Co111rie 1975:1416). In fact, however, a process much more complex than ""doubling"" is occurring: rather than simply a correspondence of the Subject of the underived verb
to another grammatical relation, both of the semantic roles filling the grammatical roles of Subject and Object of the underived verb are required to change
grammatical relations. As pointed out by Baker (1988:164-165), while this correspondence of Subject to Object and Object to Second Object is rare in the
languages of the world, it has been found in a number of languages, including
Cebuano (Gibson 1980) and Choctaw (Davies 1981); it also occurs in Imbabura
Quechua, where a subject becomes a direct object, while the original object remains marked with accusative ( rather than dative, used for di transi ti ves) but
shows no other object properties (Cole 1985:135- 141). 9
The Object status of the causee can be seen from sentences involving both
the Causative or Auxiliative marker and the First Person Object Iinperative zha
(see section 3.5.3). Thus compare the following two sentences:
9A similar but not identical change in gram1natical relations of two arguments happens in
other languages , where the Subject of the underived verb form corresponds to the Object of
the derived fonn, and the Object of the underived forn1 corresponds to an oblique relation; this
occurs, for exan1ple, in Tolai (Mosel 1984: 155).",[182]
"Similar to this use is its use in a noun phrase to mean 'everything', in which case
the head is never expressed:(979).dios wan pyan-1
God all
know-NONLOCUT
'God knows everything.'",[374]
"The First Person Object Imperative, then, singles out either the o of a transitive
verb or the first of the two non-Subject arguments of a ditransitive verb.
The first non-Subject argu1nent of a ditransitive verb is thus 111orpho~
logically and syntactically equivalent to the O of a transitive verb; the second
non-Subject argument of a ditransitive verb is very similar to the o of a transitive verb, in tenns of its n1orphology, but there are so1ne morphological and
syntactic differences. The first non-Subject argument of ditransiti ves will thus
be considered to form, together with the transitive o, the grammatical relation
of Object; the second non-Subject argument also requires a grammatical relation
rather than just a syntactic function, as it is required for the process of causativization of a transitive verb ( see section 6 .4.1) - as· this relation is very sin1ilar
to the Object relation, it will be called Second Object.
Typologically speaking, it is not unusual that, for example with the verb
kwin- 'give', the semantic role of recipient is coded by the Object, while the
gift is a Second Object. As Andrews (1985:125-126) points out, ""it is a striking
typological generalization that if the [two object] N Ps behave differently, it is the
one with the Recipient-like se1nantic role that behaves like a direct object [ie. in
the same way as o ]"".
In summary, then, Awa Pit has two object-like grammatical relations:
Object, which has Accusative case 1narking if it is referential and human, controls
the use of the na number marking morphology on the verb, and can be referred to
with the special First Person Object Imperative form; and Second Object, which
has Accusative case marking if it ·is referential and human, but cannot control
number marking on the verb, nor be referred to through the First Person Object
Imperative form.",[97]
"362CHAPTER 14. DISCOURSE CLITICSthe speaker is talking about. This idea of signalling ""aboutness"" is one of the
common ideas of topic, and is often expressed as though occurring at the level of
the sentence: ""the topic of a sentence is the thing which the proposition expressed
by the sentence is about"" (Lambrecht 1994:118). As Giv6n (1990:902) notes,
however, ""at the level of a single event / state, 'topic' - 'what is talked about' or
'what is important' - is meaningless"". What is in fact meant is that, at the level
of the discourse, a referent has ""certain discourse properties having to do with the
degree of cognitive and pragmatic accessibility it has in the discourse"" (Lambrecht
1987:375), and then at the sentence level this referent is taken as topic, with the
remainder of the sentence saying something about that referent. A topic marker
in these terms is some morphological material or syntactic construction which is
used to ""turn the attention of the hearer to some identifiable participant in the
discourse, and then to assert something of that participant"" (Aissen 1992:50).
A similar, though slightly different, formulation is suggested by Doris
Payne ( 1995), on the basis of the experimental work on comprehension of Gernsbacher (1990) and Gernsbacher & Hargreaves (1992). They claim that comprehension requires a stage of ""laying a foundation"" for a mental structure, then other
information is ""mapped"" onto this foundation to develop the structure. Payne
considers that it is not
too far afield to see Gernsbacher's experimentally-validated ""foundation"" of a n1ental representation as roughly what the Functional
Sentence Perspective school and Creider himself were getting at in
talking about the ""theme"" or ""topic"" of a discourse section·. I suggest that whatever a comprehender takes as the foundation for a
mental structure can linguistically be referred to as the thematic
concept or referent of that structure - this is the concept onto
which other information is rnapped.
(Payne 1995:451)
This idea of a foundation, while in many ways similar to the ""aboutness"" claim, is
important later in contrasting na-marked complements with na-marked adjuncts.
Looking at complements with full nouns in noun phrases and postpositional phrases, these ideas of ""aboutness"" or the idea of a ''foundation"" appear to
explain this use of the Topic marker in Awa Pit: it shows which (if any) of the
expressed complements of a predicate are the one the discourse is about, the one
onto which other inforn1ation in the sentence is mapped.
The distribution of the Topic marker on some pronouns is different from
that occurring with full nouns. It appears that the third-person pronouns, us
'he/ she' and uspa 'they', show the same distribution of Topic marker as the
nouns, but the first- and second-person pronouns are quite different: when explicit
first- or second-person pronouns are used in Awa Pit, they are almost always
accompanied by the Topic marker. Explicit pronouns are not, in fact, often used
in Awa Pit, with a combination of context and person-marking in the predicate
usually being sufficient to determine who the participants in any given eventI""',.,I
i111I

l:363are. If explicit first- or second-person pronouns are used, this is usually done
to introduce a change in topic, stress the participant in question, or establish a
contrast between one participant and another. In these cases, the participants
indicated through the use of the pronouns are highly topical, and consequently
the pronouns are marked with na. Non-topical pronouns are only used when
there would otherwise be confusion about the participants in an event; and in
these cases, the pronouns are not marked with na. For example, when a speaker
uses a subordinate clause of time involving an action performed by him- or herself
to establish the time of another event, the speaker is not a topical participant
in the major action, but a pronoun must be used to clarify the meaning, as the
subordinate clause verb is not marked for person:kal

(1009) na
'
1SG.(NOM) come-WHEN==TOP work(l)
ki-mtu-ati-zi
work(2)-IM PF-PAST-NON LOCUT
'When I came, you were working.'
In this example, the speaker (""I"") does not participate at all in the rnain action,
and is simply a minor participant in a subordinate clause. This contrasts with
very sin1ilar exa1nples, where, however, the speaker is involved in son1e way 1n
the 111ain action , and is n1arked by na in the subordinate clause:Ii

"4.4.4Demo11strative adjectivesThe subclass of demonstrative adjectives is very small, containing only two words,
an 'this' and sun 't hat'. In a string of adjectives, these words may only appear
before all other adjectives (see section 5.2).
Positionally, the demonstrative adjectives and the possessive adjectives
(see section 4.4.5) form a single subclass, and it is impossible to combine words
from the two subclasses. However there are some distributional differences. The
possessive adjectives may be used as Copula Complements or predicates, while
the demonstrative adjectives cannot; and the possessive adjectives can also be
used in an NP with an ellipsed head , while under these circumstances the demonstrative pronouns rather than the demonstrative adjectives are used, although it
is possible that historically the demonstrative pronouns have developed from the
demonstrative adjectives. 64.4.5Possessive adjectivesThe subclass of possessive adjectives is quite closely associated with the de111onstrative adjectives, although there are differences (see section 4.4 .4), with only
one word fro111 the two subclasses permitted in any string of adjectives .
There are only three possessive adjectives in Awa Pit , corresponding to
the three singular personal pronouns (see section 4.3.3): ap 'my', up 'your' and
paynya 'his / her'. There are no special plural possessive adjectives - to indicate
something which belongs to more than one person, either the singular possessive
adjective of the appropriate person may be used, or else the plural personal
pronoun is placed before the noun which is possessed. 74.5VerbsLike many South American languages , Awa Pit is a strongly verb-marking language, with a great deal of information being packed into the verb. \ /erbs are
easily recognizable, being the only words which can be marked with many affixes,
showing such things as aspect, tense and mood ( see chapter 9) as well as a number of deri vational affixes ( see section 6 .4). With the exception of a few equati ve,
identity and description sentences (see section 3.6), all sentences in Awa Pit must
contain a verb; even minimal responses in answer to polar or content questions
contain a verb - in response to the equivalent of ""Who went?"" a speaker must

"Postpositions may follow the Imperfective Participle, the Perfective Participle
and the Infinitive. Clearly, as non-finite verbal forms, these are not nouns, and
hence the postpositions cannot be considered to be noun suffixes.
There is also evidence that the postpositions go on the final element of
an NP, regardless of whether this is a noun or not. This evidence is perhaps less
strong, however it is required for the possessive marker pa and kasa ' with', as these
have not been found following another postposition, nor following a clause. The
evidence for pa being a postposition rather than a suffix is not strong, consisting
simply of sentences such as(128)Cfarmen==na

no1ninal suffix is 1nuch stronger. When speakers of Awa Pit include Spanish words
in an Awa Pit sentence, the word order of the phrase containing one or more
Spanish words may either follow Spanish or Awa Pit word order. In particular,
using a Spanish noun or adjective or both within an NP will so1netimes cause
the NP word order to be noun- adjective rather than adjective-noun. In this case
the post position follows the adjective ( that is, the entire NP) rather than being
attached to the noun:(129)na==na
cuchillo n1ocho==kasa==yu
kuzhu
lSG.(NOM)==TOP knife
blunt==with==REST pig
nak-ma-ta-w
skin-COM P-PAST-LOCUT:SU BJ'I skinned the pig with a blunt knife.'
Here it is clear that kasa follows the entire NP, and is thus clearly not a nominal
suffix but rather a cli tic to the entire NP.
As a noun phrase may have an omitted head in Awa Pit, these postpositions n1ay also, of course, follow such things as descriptive adjectives and
possessive adjectives:(130)katsa==wa kwizha

noting that, of all the things which he could have eaten, he has not even eaten a
plantain.
The Additive marker is also used commonly, though not always, with
the interrogative/ negative pronouns (section 12.2) when these are being used as
negative pronouns. That is, words such as min 'who, no-one' can either be used as
interrogatives or negatives - in the former case, they are usually accompanied
by the Interrogative marker ma (see section 14.5), while as negatives they are
usually accompanied by the Additive 1narker:(1049) min==kas

The connection between this usage and the earlier function is unclear , perhaps
through some idea such as 'of all the people who could have come, no-one came'
(and similar). Its usage may well be frequent in this context as it aids in differentiating the negative usage of these pronouns from their interrogative usage. 914.5The I11terrogative markerThe Interrogative marker has the form ma. It occurs in content questions, both
direct and indirect - in the former it is optional though common, in the latter
it is obligatory. This discourse particle occurs cliticized onto that immediate
constituent of the clause which contains the content question word, whether this
is a noun phrase, postpositional phrase or adverb. Thus in example (1054) what
is being questioned is the owner of the dog, but the entire postpositional phrase
' to whose dog' is marked with the Interrogative marker, as it is an immediate
constituent of the clause.
9The combination of an additive marker and an interrogative pronoun to fonn a negative
pronoun is also found in Imbabura Quechua (Cole 1985 :86-87); and, apparently, in Guambiano,
based on an example in Vasquez de Rufz (1988:67).","[396, 397]"
"7.2.8.1InfinitiveThe Infinitive marker na ( and its allomorph n) has a wide variety of functions,
although it is restricted to appearing in non-finite subordinate clauses. There are
a variety of definitions given for infinitives, from traditional ones, ""the non-finite
form of the verb usually cited as its unmarked or base form"" (Crystal 1985:157),
through to more complex ones. such as that of Noonan (1985:57):
verb-like entities that do not bear syntactic relations to their notional subjects; i.e. their subjects do not take nominative case marking or condition verb agreement .... But because infinitives are verblike, the relations that they may establish with their objects ... are
the san1e as those established by [other verb forms].",[199]
"368CHAPTER 14. DISCOURSE CLITICSIn the case of the first two, the original sentence asked was 'Demetrio's horse
has a long tail'; the last sentence was asked using the Spanish 'dative of affect'
construction.
In these sentences, then, there is an initial, non-complement NP, marked
with the Topic marker na. This non-complement element is in some way involved
in the main predication (in all of the above sentences, as an owner of one of the
complements). In all cases this initial element was set off from the remainder
of the sentence by a pause, indicated with a co1nma above. This setting off of
the na marked element is identical to the use of the Topic marker with adjuncts,
discussed in the previous section, and the meaning developed to cover the usage
of na with adjuncts is, in fact, equally relevant here. This initial Topic-marked
element establishes a framework for the remainder of the predication: ""We're
discussing something to do with Demetrio's horse; the tail is long."" It is important
to note that in the first two sentences above, there is a second Topic-marked
element, mita, the tail, which is the actual ""about"" topic, and the Subject of the
predication.
Awa Pit thus seems to have a ""double-subject"" construction. Few examples have been found of it, however this may be more related to the elicitation
technique than the nature of the language. In this construction, there is a main
predication, which may contain an explicit, Topic-marked, Subject, stating what
the predication is about; and there is an initial Topic-marked element, set off by
an intonation indicating that it is an adjunct, and establishes a framework within
which the following predication can be understood.
The presence of an external topic constrution suggests, following Li &
Tho1npson's (1976) typology, that Awa Pit is at least in part a topic:-prominent
language, as ""all [topic-prominent] languages have sentences of this type, while
no pure [subject-prominent] languages do"" (Li & Thon1pson 1976:468). Various
other factors also suggest the topic-prominent nature of Awa Pit ( the lack of a
passive and dummy subjects, for exa1nple); however nominative-accusative casemarking would tend to suggest a subject-prominent language. It would thus
appear that Awa Pit is a mixed topic-prominent and subject-prominent system,
although a great deal of further work would need to be done on the basicness or
otherwise of these constructions with external topics to establish this with any
certainty.","[390, 391]"
"13.5Man11er adverbials,111The position (almost) directly before a verb in a sentence in Awa Pit may be filled
by a manner adverbial - only the negative n1arker shi and the degree adverb pina
intervene between a rnanner adverbial and the verb. While n1anner adverbials
do, in some fashion, state something about the manner in which the verb was
carried out, this semantic idea is somewhat vague, and perhaps a better term
would be simply 'adverbial'. The term ' manner adverbial' is chosen to maintain
a terminological distinction between, for exan1ple, '1nanner adverbs' (otherwise
'adverbs'), 'tin1e adverbs' and ' degree adverbs'.
The manner adverbial slot can be filled by words from three distinct word
classes. Perhaps the most basic of words to fill this position are the manner
adverbs. It can also, however, be filled by an adjective (or degree adverb or
comparative marker plus adjective), provided that this is semantically reasonable.
There are also cases where this slot is filled by a noun, although it is unclear in
these cases whether this is a productive use of nouns as manner adverbials, or
whether these are lexically fixed compound verbs. The use of nouns as manner
III •CHAPTER 13. ADJUNCTS AND ADVERBS350adverbials will not be discussed here, then, but rather in section 4.5.6, dealing
specifically with compound verbs.
While both manner adverbs and adjectives can fill the manner adverbial
position, these two word classes can be distinguished, in the same way in which it
is possible to distinguish ti1ne adverbs and nouns with te1nporal reference. While
adjectives can be used within a noun phrase to modify a noun as well as in the
manner adverbial slot to modify a verb, the manner adverbs can only be used in
manner adverbial position and cannot modify a noun within a noun phrase:(967)watampugood man

whole as the modifier, and the part as the head noun. The modifier whole may
be a referential human (in which case the construction with pa or a possessive
adjective is used), or a non-referential human or a non-human ( encoded through
a bare noun modifier) :6
5It should be noted that while alienable possession , kinship relations and ""possession"" of
body parts are treated identically within an NP, there is a difference in the coding of these
relations through verbs: alienable possession and kinship relations use the verb mil 'have',
while the ""possession"" of body parts is described using the verb waj 'have (body part)'.
6
It is interesting to note here that while Imbabura Quechua similarly encodes part-whole
relationships with either a genitive marker or a bare noun, the distinction in that language is
between animates and inanimates , rather than referential human and others ( Cole 1985: 117).",[146]
"RELATIVE CLAUSES281a surface sentence depending on the language.
(I(eenan & Comrie 1977:63-64)
Comrie ( 1981: 136-137) modifies this definition slightly, and extends its
use. He considers that his definition is ""a characterization of the prototypical
relative clause, rather than a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the
identification of relative clauses"", and notes that ""in order to say that a language
has relative clauses, it should be the case that there is some construction or
constructions correlating highly with the definition"":
A relative clause then consists necessarily of a head and a restricting
clause. The head in itself has a certain potential range of referents ,
but the restricting clause restricts this set by giving a proposition
that must be true of the actual referents of the over-all construction.
(Comrie 1981:136)
However he believes that English sentences such as non-finite constructions (passengers leaving on flight 738 should .. . ) and those involving restrictive attributive
adjectives ( the good students all passed the examination) are included in the
definition of relative clauses.
I(eenan ( 1985: 142) has essentially the same semantic definition as the other
two works. However, the presence of a restrictive clause (SreI) is considered to be
the defining feature of a relative clause. Under this definition,
there are structures we consider relative clauses which lack a domain noun, in which case the domain of relativization is the class
of objects of which it n1akes sense to assert the restrictive clause.
(I(eenan 1985: 142)
While accepting these as relative clauses, I{eenan bases hi s classification on relative clauses which contain a domain noun, and has no further discussion of
relative clauses without such a noun.
In Awa Pit there are various constructions which fulfil at least some of
the requirements for relative clauses. Three of these - the lexical nominalizations, the deverbal adjectives and the purposive adjectives - lack so many
clausal features and have such a variety of idiosyncratic restrictions that they are
considered to be derivational processes, forming nouns or adjectives from verbs ,
rather than being (relative) clauses, and hence these processes were discussed in
sections 5.2.1, 5.2.3.1 and 5.2.3.2 respectively. There are also similarities between
relative clauses and the agentive clausal nominalizations discussed in section 10.5 ,
but, as will be explained there, there are sufficient differences to consider this construction as quite distinct from a relative clause.
This leaves two constructions as relative clauses, one formed with the Positive Adjectivizer m(u), the other with the Negative Adjectivizer 16 kayIJ, although
16The Negative Adjectivizer is similar in function to the habitual negative in Epena Pedee ,
discussed in Harms (1994:135-136).",[302]
"4.3.3Personal pro11ounsThe non-interrogative personal pronouns, which necessarily refer to hun1ans only,
are differentiated for three persons and two numbers. There are also two interrogative / negative personal pronouns and two indefinite pronouns ; these have no
nu1nber distinctions. 2 (See Table 4.3 for the forms.) The existence of special
plural forms for the non-interrogative and non-indefinite pronouns is one of the
factors which distinguish personal pronouns from other non1inals, which have no
number marking.
While other referential human N Ps use the postposi tion ta to indicate that
they are in Object relation (see section 5.4.2), the personal pronouns have special
2The indefinites are clearly based on the interrogative/ negative pronouns , plus a following
waza, which does not appear to occur elsewhere in the language.",[106]
"4.3.4Den1011strative pro11ou11sThere are two demonstrative pronouns in Awa Pit, corresponding to the two
demonstrative adjectives (see section 4.4.4): ana ' this' and suna 'that ' . These
demons tr a ti ve pronouns cannot be n1odified.
The demonstrative pronouns are distinguished from other nominals in that
they cannot be followed by the Topic marker na. It would appear that, historically, these pronouns may have developed from the demonstrative adjectives
an 'this' and sun 'that' by the affixation of the Topic marker, and this would
explain their inability to be used together with the Topic 1narker. However synchronically they are unitary lexical items, as can be seen fro1n two facts: ( 1)
they have only a single n, while a co1nbination of the de1nonstrative adjective
and the Topic 1narker should have two adjacent ns - ana 'this ( den1onstrative
pronoun)' versus an==na 'this (den1onstrative adjective) == Topic n1arker \ and (2)
the Accusati ve-n1arking postposi tion ta ( and other postpositions) occurs after
the entire demonstrative pronoun, whereas when other Accusative nominals are
topicalized, the Topic marker occurs after the Accusative n1arking:
(85)ana==tathis==ACC
'this (Object)'(86)kuzhu==ta==napig==ACC==TOP
'pig (Object)'
The demonstrative pronouns are also unique in that they may refer either
to humans or non-humans. Other nominals are either inherently human or inherently non-human. When in Object position, if the demonstrative pronouns are
referring to humans they will take Accusative marking; if referring to non-hun1ans
they will appear without Accusative marking.",[108]
"5.2N 01111 pl1rasesThe head of an NP is , naturally, a noun or pronoun , although under certain conditions this head can be ellipsed (see 5.2.5). With the exception of the nominal
postmodifiers (see 4.3.6) , all other non1inals discussed in section 4.3 can be used
as the head of an NP: nouns , time and place nouns , personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns , and relational nouns ( although there are strong restrictions on
all of these except nouns) .
As ·well as a noun or pronoun head , an NP has many other possi bili ties. Awa Pit has a productive clausal nominalization strategy, discussed in section 10.5; however certain nominalizations have diverged from this pattern, and
apparently been lexicalized (section 5.2.1). While there is no true reflexive construction in Av,.ra Pit, the techniques used by Awa Pit to reflect the same meanings
are largely based on the selection of appropriate NPs (section 5.2.2) . Nominal
heads of NPs can, of course, be modified, and the strategies for modification are
discussed in section 5. 2. 3; one particular modification strategy, used for possession. has a wide range of functions, and these are examined in section 5.2.4.",[136]
"8.2. LOCUTOR AND J\TON-LOCUTOR8.2~
r1189Loct1tor a11d No11-loct1torThe complexity of the Awa Pit person-marking system is due in part to the
interaction of two separate systems; or at least, two systems which appear to
be separate, although cross-linguistic comparisons suggest that the two may be
interrelated. While each of these systen1s is not, of itself, con1plex, both are
unusual, and the interaction of the two leads to an overall complex system which
is bewildering, on the surface. This section deals with the Locutor / N on-locutor
distinction which is the major person-marking distinction in the system; the
following two sections examine how this system interacts with semantic roles and
grammatical relations to produce the system used to mark person in the Past
tense and non-Past tenses.
As is detailed in section 4.3.3, Awa Pit recognizes the ""usual"" three persons
lexically, in its pronouns: first person na 'I', second person nu 'you' and third
person us 'he, she', to give the singular Non1inative personal pronoun forms.
These persons and correspondences to lexical pronouns are invariant - that is,
a notional first person argu1nent can always be expressed through one of the first
person pronouns, and so on, regardless of the type of utterance; of course the
con1n1011 use of ellipsis in Awa Pit n1eans that the personal pronouns are not
often used, except to indicate emphasis or to disambiguate utterances.
The person-marking system, as expressed through verbal affixes, does not
have this three-way division, but rather a binary division into Locutor and Nonlocutor. These terms are perhaps not the most felicitous, but have been chosen
as they are used in Vasquez de Ruiz's (1988) analysis of the related language
Gua1nbiano; although it is, in fact, unclear from Vasquez de Ruiz's analysis
whether the system in which the Guambiano Locutor and Non-locutor operate is
the same as the Awa Pit system or not. 4 The terms ' Locutor' and ' Non-locutor '
could perhaps be n1ore accurately replaced by 'item of interest is (or is not)
episte1nic source for this type of utterance'; this is clearly not appropriate for
glossing or easy reference, however.
In discussion of a similar phenomenon in Tibetan languages, the terms
'conjunct' ( corresponding to Locutor) and 'disjunct' (N on-locutor) have sometimes been used, but these terms have been avoided for four reasons. Firstly,
they refer only to the verb form, and are not used to refer to entites, which will
be done below with Locutor and Non-locutor. Secondly, the terms were chosen
by Hale (1980) for I(athmandu Newari because of the behaviour of these verb
fonns in indirect speech subordinate clauses, and this is precisely where they
differ from Awa Pit Locutor and Non-locutor, which never occur in such clauses.
Thirdly, the most precise definition of a conjunct / disjunct system is that given
by DeLancey (1992:57), and this definition includes features which are not found
in the Awa Pit system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly in practical terms ,
4V asquez de Ruiz (1988) only gives examples of Gua1nbiano person marking in statements ,
where Locutor corresponds to first person, Non-locutor to second and third person. As she
gives no exan1ples of questions, it is unclear whether the Locutor and Non-locutor in Guambiano retains these correspondences of 1narking to person in questions , or undergo the same
""reassignment"" as in Awa Pit.","[209, 210]"

have adpositions or complex adpositions. While the meaning of these is perhaps
not strictly that of a relation between two non1inals, formally they are construe~
ted in exactly the sa1ne way as possessive constructions, with the relational noun
as head, and the other nominal n1odifying this - referential human nouns take
an encli tic pa, or a possessive adjective if prono1ninalized; other nouns are simply
placed before the relational noun. This distinguishes this Awa Pit construction
from a similar construction found in Imbabura Quechua where, except for chawpi
'between, among', the ""complex postpositions"" are simply placed after the noun
to which they refer, with no marking indicating the relationship even for animate
nouns (Cole 1985:120-124). 7

"1.,6.3. NON-PRODUC'TIVE DERIVATIONS155be topicalized with na, preposed or post posed in the sentence, and it cannot be
referred back to in a following sentence - it is inherently non-referential.
Thus while these compounds are phonologically two words, they are lexically one word, and must be entered explicitly in the lexicon. 6 Grammatically
they are dual-natured - for nearly all processes they are treated as a single unit,
however negation treats the second item as a verb, and the first as some sort of
modifier. This dual treatment of compound verbs under syntax - two words
for negation, one unit for most other processes - is actually remarkably similar
to the treatment of compound verbs in American Sign Language (ASL) with respect to the inchoative morpheme. In ASL compounds, there are clear reasons
for treating co1npounds of two verbs as a single lexical item (for example, THINK
+ MARRY 'believe'); but the inchoative derivation, which normally affects the
beginning of a verb affects the beginning of the second half of the verb in these
compounds (Liddell & Johnson 1985). The conclusion, both for ASL and for
Awa Pit, is that ""a lexical compound ... is a morphologically simple word (i.e., a
single morpheme) with two phonological parts"" (Liddell & Johnson 1985:95); in
the terms used here , a compound verb is a single lexical i tern consisting of two
phonological words and two grammatical words, although the two gran1matical
words almost al ways act together in the same way as a single grammatical word.
6.3.3.3Con1pounds as incorporationSetting aside the use of compound verbs involving a Spanish verb, the other compound verbs show many similarities to what is often considered as incorporation.
Unfortunately, the majority of work has been done on noun incorporation - the
incorporation of a noun into a verb. Examining those cases where a synchronically existing noun in Awa Pit is identical to the first half of a co1npound verb, we
can see that Awa Pit probably has what Mithun (1984) has tern1ed Type I and
Type II noun incorporation.
In Mithun's (1984) Type I incorporation , an argument of a verb has been
incorporated into the verb, with the complex having one less argument than the
original verb. It is not clear that this occurs in Awa Pit, although it may be the
case with alu ki- ' rain'. If we assume that this verb is formed by incorporating
the Subject alu ' rain' into the verb ki- ' happen ' then it is true that the resulting
compound has one less argument than the original verb - none rather than
one. However in her discussion of Type I noun incorporation Niithun (1984)
only discusses transitive verbs becoming intransitive through the incorporation
of an object. Equally, her Type I incorporated nouns are necessarily in particular
semantic relations to the verb - patient, location or instrument - and alu 'rain'
is probably none of these in alu ki- 'rain ' (though it does depend on how the term
'patient' is interpreted).
There is also only one example of what may be Type II noun incorporation
in the data, the com pound s ula ku- 'bite' from s ula 'tooth' and ku- 'eat, drink'.
This compound is , in fact, identical to the results of the system of ""instrumental

It is perhaps worth noting that the clitic na, used in many of these examples, is not a
case-marking clitic, but rather a topic marker, and may occur on a wide variety of elements,
although it is 1nost commonly found on Subjects (see section 14.2) .",[86]

5.2.4.6Material-objectIt is often necessary to state what 1naterial an obj ect is made from. In this case
the object is the head noun, and the material is a modifier. The 1naterial is, of
course, non-human, and hence a bare noun modifier is used. It does not matter
whether the object has been constructed by people or is naturally occurring:( 19 0)k wal ti y al

Specific-generalThere is one further construction which appears to use a bare noun n1odifier,
which is the specific-generic construction. Unfortunately, little data is available
on this construction.
While there do not appear to be any cases in Awa Pit where it is necessary
to use a specific-general construction, these constructions are sometimes used
with plants and animals. For example, kalputut 'mouse sp.' is a particular variety
of tunya 'mouse', and simply saying kalputut is sufficient to identify this animal
- but often it will be referred to as kalputut tunya. Likewise rather than wisha
'w hite person', speakers will often say wisha awa 'white:person person'.
These constructions could perhaps be considered as a forn1 of noun classifier, a classification device which accompanies the noun regardless of the presence of modifiers . However noun classifiers are commonly used anaphorically
(Craig forthcoming), and there is no evidence of this in Awa Pit, nor is there
evidence of the system extending beyond animals and plants.
In addition to the specific-general constructions, there are also similar
constructions involving types of trees. However with these constructions the
modifier has ""fused"" with the word ti 'tree' to form one word. Thus for example130f\TPS, PPS AND COPULA COMPLEl\!fE1VTSCHAPTER 5.there is a particular variety of local tree called kwalti, and ba1nboo is called
