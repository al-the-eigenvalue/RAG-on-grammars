nm tee eabetantivaly thePersonal pronouns do not formally distinguish between the nominative and the
ergative case. There are no separate pronouns for the third person; demonstrative
pronouns are used instead. Hunzib has no possessive pronouns; the genitive and
instrumental cases of the personal pronouns are also used to indicate possession.","[40, 41]"
"Agreement in adjectives and verbs is generally indicated by class prefixes; in some
verbs, in the auxiliary and in pronouns, agreement is (also) indicated by apophony.
The agreement operates on a nominative-ergative basis. There are four nominal
stem forms from which the case forms are derived: the base stem, the oblique
singular stem, the plural stem, and the oblique plural stem. The oblique stems are
formed from the base or plural stems by a stem-extending oblique morpheme.
Oblique case endings (ergative, genitive, instrumental and the local endings) are
added to the oblique stems. The seven local endings can be followed by the
approximativesuffix, after whichtwodirectional suffixesmayoccur, viz. elative andtranslative. The local endings can be accompanied by adverbs which reinforce theirmeaning.

"English and Russian 363Hunzib is a non-written language; in education, printing and broadcasting, Avar
and Russian are used. Until recently, only (unpublished) Russian materials were
available on this language. The data presented in this thesis was gathered during
on-site fieldwork in Daghestan (Russia).
The thesis consists of three parts. Part I is a grammatical sketch of the Hunzib
language, containing six chapters, covering the phonology, morphology and syntax.
The material presented here was elicited or taken from the texts. Part II is a
corpus of texts. All texts have been morphologically analysed and interlinear glosses
are given, besides a more literary translation. Part III is a Hunzib-English lexicon,

suffix, endings take their full (ie. CV) form. When a noun, whether human or
non-human, is coordinated with a human singular noun, co-referring verbs and
adjectives have a human plural class marker. The coordination of non-human single
nouns triggers a non-human plural marker. Agreement for number by plural

‘there is the bed in which the girl sleeps’For the past participle (PPT) the adjectival ending -u is added to the preterite. The
negative ending is -fs.u. When used attributively, -u can be dropped. The presence
of -u before a nominative noun and its absence before an oblique noun is
regarded as correct, but this is a tendency only (see 4.1.1.). The past participle can
be found in complex finite forms (see 5.9.). When used substantivally, the participle
can be inflected (see 4.1.1. and 6.3.). Three of the declined forms have a clear
function in subordinate clauses.‘the girl who saw me (M) is my sister’
