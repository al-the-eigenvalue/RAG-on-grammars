So, this property that nouns (such as the underlined ones given in (28)) have of
determining the inflecting properties of other elements inside the same phrasal
construction or clause can be taken to be one of the defining properties of a head of a NP.
The second is that various of the examples above also show that a noun (or pronoun) can
be the only element within a bare NP. The control of inflecting properties, then, can be
used to motivate the category head of a NP, and nouns and independent pronouns are the
elements that can head a NP. Hence, following the “head rule as internal structure test
for phrase class” given in (15), the presence of a noun or pronoun head constitutes a
positive evidence of a NP. Also, following the “internal structure test for phrase class”
given in (13), the presence of a numeral or demonstrative (as elements internal to NPs)
will count as positive evidence of NPs —insofar as wherever one finds a demonstrative
or a numeral, one will also find a NP.
In contrast to languages that require a determiner in order for the noun to function
as the syntactic expression of a verbal argument, in Apurinã nouns can stand by
themselves (without any determiner) as the sole nominal expression of a subject or an
object. In the following examples hãtako-ro ‘youth-F’, and ximaku ‘fish’ are instances of
nouns that can stand by themselves as the nominal expression of notional subject and
object, respectively:45629a. o-su-pe
hãtako-ro
3F-go-PFTV youth-F
‘The girl left.’
b. hãtako-ro nhika-ru ximaku
youth-F
eat-3M.O fish
‘The girl ate fish.’
c. ximaku o-muna hãtako-ro
fish
3F-bring youth-F
The girl brought fish.’
There are some preliminary indications that in some Apurinã speech varieties the
demonstrative forms constitute a subclass of independent pronouns, insofar as they can
stand by themselves as a noun phrase. If further investigation confirms the existence of
pronominal demonstratives in those speech varieties, the NP structure will need to be
revised accordingly for those speech varieties, since in such cases demonstratives would
constitute instances of pronouns.
One final note about subject/object/possessor NPs is that, as was shown in 7.3,
pronominal markers are in complementary distribution with pre-verbal (but NOT postverbal) coreferential subject/object (pro)nominals and with any coreferential possessor
(pro)nominal. Now that NPs have been introduced, this complementary distribution can
be thought of as involving subject/object/possessor NPs and coreferential person markers.
The examples in (30) further illustrate this complementary distribution:
30a. o-apo-pe
3F-arrive-PFTV
‘She has already arrived.’
b. *[owa]NP o-apo-pe
3SG.F 3F-arrive-PFTV
(She has already arrived.)457c. *owa o-unuro
apo-pe 3
3SG.F 3F-mother.of arrive-PFTV
(Her mother has already arrived.)
d. *o-unuro
owa
apo-pe
3F-mother.of 3SG.F arrive-PFTV
(Her mother has already arrived.)
In (30a) this form o- ‘3F’ can stand by itself as the sole formal expression of an
argument of the verb; (30b) shows that this same pronominal marker is in complementary
distribution with the coreferential independent pronominal subject; (30c) shows that the
pronominal marker is in complementary distribution with the pre-nominal possessor; and,
in (30d) the pronominal marker is shown to be also in complementary distribution with
the postnominal possessor. Insofar as pronominal markers can replace pre-verbal
coreferential nouns or independent pronouns, they behave like NPs. However, they are
NOT in complementary distribution (i.e. they can co-occur) with post-verbal NPs, as
shown by (28) and various of the previous examples. The complementary distribution
involving pronominal markers and a subset of coreferential NPs (i.e. subject, object and
possessor NPs) under the circumstances just described is relevant for the identification of
NPs insofar as it can be used to identify one important subset of NPs in the language.
8.1.1.2Oblique Noun Phrases
Oblique noun phrases (hereafter NPobl) consist of nominal forms that aremarked with one of the oblique markers which were morphologically described in
chapter 7, in 7.1.2, and whose syntactic function of the (pro)nominal expressions where3This sentence, however, could be grammatical if interpreted as ‘Her mother, she has left.’458they occur will be discussed in 8.3.2. Oblique markers are the bound forms that attach to
a (pro)noun to form a NPobl, as the examples in (31) illustrate:
31a. n-awa-ru
wai [[nota tanu-ro
nurumane]NP -kata]NPobl
1SG-exist-3M.O here
1SG spouse.of-F relative-ASSOC
‘I live here with the relatives of my wife.’
b. p-ita-ru
su-pe
[[ata nurumane awapoko]NP -mokaru]NPobl
2SG-brother.of-M go-PFTV 1PL relative
village-GOAL
‘Your brother has gone to the village of our people.’
As can be gathered from the two examples in (31), although the morphological “host” of
the oblique marker is always the last word of a NPobl, its semantic scope is the whole
NPobl within which it occurs, not the word base it is phonologically attached to. The
ungrammatical examples in (32) are given to demonstrate the fact that oblique markers
cannot attach to elements within a NPobl other than the rightmost one:
32a. *n-awa-ru
wai nota tanu-ro1-kata
nurumane
1SG-exist-3M.O here 1SG spouse.of-F-ASSOC relative
(I live here with the relatives of my wife.)
b. *n-awa-ru
wai
nota-kata
tanu-ro1
nurumane
1SG-exist-3M.O here 1SG-ASSOC spouse.of-F relative.of
(I live here with the relatives of my wife.)
The examples in (33) show that a NPobl passes both the movement and
replacement tests for constituency. If we compare (33a) to (31a) we can see that the
NPobl can move as a unit; and if we compare (33b) to (31b) we can see that a NPobl can be
replaced by a single word, where both clauses (with and without replacement) have
related meanings in that they can refer to the same location/goal:45933a. [[nota tanu-ro
nurumane]NP -kata]NPobl n-awa-ru
wai
1SG spouse.of-F relative-ASSOC
1SG-exist-3M.O here
‘I live here with the relatives of my wife.’
b. p-ita-ru
su-pe
[werã]
2SG-brother-M go-PFTV there
‘Your brother has gone there.’
A valid question about what is being treated here as NPobls regards the extent to
which they are different from NPs and, moreover, whether such differences would justify
creating a new phrasal category rather than simply positing a new NP subcategory. In
terms of the structural definition given in the previous subsection for NPs, one could
argue that the following examples in (34) present a piece of evidence for not treating the
putative NPobls as NPs, where in (34b) a pronoun cannot replace the NPobl given in (34a):
34a. nota apo-pe
[mipa-kata]
1SG arrive-PFTV Mipa-ASSOC
‘I came with Mipa.’
b. *nota apo-pe
[uwa]
1SG arrive-PFTV 3SG.M
For all NPs seen so far it is the case that they can be replaced with an independent
coreferential pronoun. Thus, what is relevant in (34) is precisely the fact that, as shown
by (34b), NPobls cannot be replaced by a coreferential independent pronoun. However,
the ungrammaticality of (34b) follows directy from the semantics that the oblique marker
-kata adds to the NPobl mipa-kata, rather than necessarily from any structural distinction
between caseless and oblique noun phrases. That is, the distinction between NPs and
NPobls can be described solely in terms of their distribution in the clause that follows
from the grammatical relations they bear. So, as an associative oblique grammatical460relation (described in detail in 8.3.2.3), mipa-kata can only be replaced by a semantically
compatible “pro-form”, as illustrated in (35):
35a. nota apo-pe
[uwa-kata]
1SG arrive-PFTV 3SG.M-ASSOC
‘I came with him.’
Another possible argument for distinguishing NPobls from NPs in Apurinã follows
from its internal structure. As was seen in the previous section and summarized in (27), a
NP can precede a possessed noun. In (36) it is shown that NPobls cannot occur with a
possessed noun:
36. *nu-suka-ru
uwa
[nota hãke-ru-monhi] suto-re
1SG-give-3O.M 3SG.M 1SG child-M-GOAL woman-POSSED
(I gave it to the wife of my son.)
In (36), again the distinction can be argued to follow from the semantics of possession
construction rather then from any structural syntactic property of NPobls.
In sum, aside from always taking an oblique marker, NPobls also differ from NPs
in that they cannot be replaced by a coreferential independent pronoun, and in that they
cannot function as possessor. However, a different interpretation of the evidence
presented so far for distinguishing NPobls from NPs is that they follow from the semantic
roles denoted by NPobls, rather than from any major structural syntactic distinctions they
might have. In fact, the extent to which no crucial grammatical property is revealed by
how the distinctions between NPobls and NPs are categorized by itself suggests that this
may be ultimately a terminological issue. For the purpose of this work, I will continue to
treat NPobls as a subtype of noun phrases in Apurinã. Furthermore, as will be seen in the461description of grammatical relations in 8.3, there is a strong correlation between each
individual type of NPobl and the semantic roles they denote.","[486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493]"
"3.5.1Affixes
Affixes are the bound formatives used individually or as part of a paradigm toencode grammatical categories generally associated with a specific word class. Different
affixes can precede (as prefixes) or (exclusively) follow (as suffixes) the word base they
attach to, but no affix can interrupt (as an infix) a formative. The plural suffix -wako-ru
illustrated in (4) and the nominalizer suffix -re illustrated in (10b) are instances of typical
affixes. There is one instance of an affix combination that may be analyzed as a circumfix
(or a discontinuous morpheme), namely the forms involved in marking third person plural,
u-... -na; however, I will also consider the possibility of describing this potential case of
circumfix as an instance of discontinuous dependencies (Spencer 1991:210), a notion137independently motivated in the language by a specific subset of verbal formatives.
Conceivably, in discontinuous dependencies two forms may work together to encode a
lexical meaning or grammatical function without necessarily constituting a single
morpheme. (E.g., the verb plus particle combinations in English, as in call him up.)3.5.2Other Special Types of Bound Formatives
Apart from the forms that behave as typical affixes in the language, there are variousbound formatives that show a behavior distinct from typical affixes in the following ways:
They occur outside of typical affixes, some of them “float” in the clause, and they tend to
interact in special ways with syntactic phenomena. The special bound formatives that occur
with different word classes can be illustrated by the associative oblique marker -kata, as in
nota-kata ‘with me’, ata-kata ‘with us’, unawa-kata ‘with them’ etc.
The special bound formatives that occur with different word classes and that
fluctuate in the clause can be illustrated by the future marker -ko in (11), where -ko
occurs either attached to the pronoun or to the verb without any change in the
propositional meaning of the clause:
11a. nota muteka-ko
1SG run-FUT
b. nota-ko
muteka
1SG-FUT run‘I’ll run away.’
‘I’ll run away.’The detailed description of the properties of these special types of bound formatives and the
extent to which they relate to cliticization phenomena is done in chapter 7, in 7.3.","[168, 169]"
"Unless noted otherwise, I will be (hereafter) using the abbreviation NP to refer
exclusively to caseless noun phrases. A NP can consist of the nominal construction that
functions as the possessor in possession constructions, where possession is marked
following the patterns discussed in 4.1. In the following example in (16) the nominal
construction [kema hãke-ru1] ‘tapir’s babe.of-M’ is the possessor of kuwu ‘head.of’:
16. [kema hãke-ru1] kuwu
mita-ru
tapir child.of-M head.of be.big-3M.O
‘The tapir’s babe’s head is big.’
(17a) shows that [kema hãke-ru1] can be replaced by the independent pronoun for
third person singular masculine uwa, thus behaving as a phrasal unit on the basis of the
replacement test. (17b), on the other hand, shows that a nominal construction that is used
as the possessor element cannot occur preceded by the possessed noun:
17a. [uwa] kuwu
mita-ru
3SG.M head.of be.big-M.O
‘Its/his head is big.’
b. *kuwu [kema hãke-rui] mita-ru
head
tapir babe.of-M be.big-M.O
(The tapir’s babe’s head is big.)449Although (17b) does not furnish positive evidence that [kema hãke-ru1] behaves as a
phrasal unit on the basis of the movement test, further examples will show that the
restriction on the movement of [kema hãke-ru1] (17b) follows from the function that this
nominal construction has in that specific clause, namely to express the possessor. In
possession constructions the nominal (or pronominal) possessor necessarily precedes the
possessed noun, that is, both possessor and possessed elements have a fixed position.
This is further demonstrated by the ungrammatical constructions in (18), where the
possessed noun kuwu ‘head of’ precedes the possessor pronominal and possessor nominal
forms respectively:
18a. *kuwu
uwa
head.of 3SG.M
(his head)
b. *kuwu
kema
head.of tapir
(tapir’s head)
Aside from functioning as the possessor, a NP can also function as subject/object
of a verb. In (19) the nominal construction [[kema hãke-ru1]NP kuwu] ‘the tapir’s babeM’s head’ functions as the object of the objective descriptive verb mita-ru ‘be.big-3M.O’
insofar as it is coreferential with the object pronominal marker, -ru, in the verb. As can
be seen from (19a), the nominal constructions [[kema hãke-ru1]NP kuwu]NP can be
replaced by the third person singular masculine pronoun, uwa. Also, as shown in (19b),
the whole of [[kema hãke-ru1]NP kuwu]NP can occur also post-verbally. Hence, the
examples in (19a-b) show that such a nominal construction passes both the replacement
and movement test for NP:45019a. [uwa] mita-ru
3SG.M be.big-3M.O
‘It’s big.’
b. mita-ru
[kema hãke-ruI kuwu]
be.big-M.O tapir babe.of-M head.of
‘The tapir’s babe’s head is big.’
NPs can also consist of a noun following a numeral. In (20a) the noun form suto
follows the feminine numeral hãt-o ‘one-F’, forming the NP [hãto suto]NP. The examples
in (20b-c) show that such a nominal construction passes both the replacement and
movement tests for phrasal constituency:
20a. [hãt-o
suto]NP apo-pe-ka
NUM-F woman fall-PFTV-PRED
‘One woman has arrived.’
b. [owa]NP apo-pe-ka
3SG.F arrive-PFTV-PRED
‘She has arrived.’
c. õ-apo-pe-ka
[hãt-o
suto]NP
3F-arrive-PFTV-PRED NUM-F woman
‘The woman has arrived.’
The example in (21a) shows that demonstratives and numerals can co-occur within a
complex NP. (21b-c) only confirms that this complex nominal construction is consistent
with both the replacement and movement tests for phrasal constituency:
21a. [o-ye
hãt-o
suto]NP apo-pe-ka
F-PROX NUM-F woman arrive-PFTV-PRED
‘This one woman has arrived’
b. [owa]NP apo-pe
3SG.F arrive-PFTV
‘She has arrived.’451c. o-apo-pe-ka
[o-ye
hãt-o
suto]NP
3F-arrive-PFTV-PRED F-PROX NUM-F woman
‘This one woman has arrived.’
In possession constructions in which the possessive noun is preceded by a
modifier, it is the possessed element that is modified, not the possessor, as illustrated in
(22) where the speaker refers to ‘the two arrows of Mipa’ rather than ‘the arrow of two
Mipas’:
22. n-atama-ta-ru [epi mipa serepi]NP
1SG-see-VBLZ two Mipa arrow.of
‘I saw the two arrows of Mipa’s.’
Moreover, not only it is the case that in possession constructions it is the possessed (not
the possessor) element that is modified, but, actually, in a possession construction ONLY
the possessed element can be modified, as shown in (23). That is, in a nominal
possession construction such as o-ye suto unuro [F-PROX woman mother.of] in (23a) the
demonstrative o-ye can be interpreted as modifying the possessed noun, i.e. unuro, but
not as modifying the possessor noun, i.e. suto. In translating an English construction
such as ‘This woman’s mother has arrived’, where the possessor noun is modified, the
construction in (23b) is used instead:
suto
unuro]NP apo-pe-ka
23a. [o-ye
F-PROX woman mother.of arrive-PFTV-PRED
‘This mother of the woman has arrived’
*(This woman’s mother has arrived.)
b. [o-ye
suto]NP [õ-unuro]NP
apo-pe-ka
F-PROX woman 3F-mother.of arrive-PFTV-PRED
‘This woman’s mother has arrived.’
Lit.: ‘This woman, her mother has arrived.’452In (23b) two NPs are used. The first NP consists of a noun followed by a demonstrative,
whereas the second NP consists of a possessor marker (that is coreferential with the noun
in the previous NP) plus the possessed noun it attaches to.
At the present time I have found few cases illustrating the restriction on the
modification of possessed nouns. However, although it will be important to verify
additional data with more speakers in order to determine the generality of the restriction
on the modification of possessed elements as a grammatical constraint in the language,
there is at least one independent grammatical factor that could help to motivate this
restriction. The possessed element in a possession construction cannot be directly
modified by anything other than the possessor (pro)nominal form. That is, a possessed
noun cannot be immediately preceded by anything other than the possessor (pro)nominal
form (including here the pronominal possessor markers). So, the constructions in (24)
are ungrammatical because the modifier, the numeral in (24a) and the demonstrative in
(24b), occur inside a possession construction, immediately preceding the possessed noun:
24a. *mipa epi serepi
Mipa two arrow.of
(Mipa’s two arrows…)
(two arrows of Mipa’s…)
b. *mipa i-kira
aiko-te
Mipa F-DIST house-POSSED
(that Mipa’s house…)
(that house of Mipa’s…)
Since modifiers cannot occur immediately before a possessed noun (nor after it), they
need to precede the possessor form which, in its turn, precedes the possessed noun.
Preceding the possessor form could, in principle, cause ambiguity of interpretation,
insofar as the modifier would be interpretable as modifying either the possessor or the
453possessed element. One way of avoiding such a potential ambiguity would be to
constrain the interpretation of the scope of the modifier so that, as it seems to be the case,
only the possessed noun can be modified inside a NP containing a possession
construction.
The examples in (25) illustrate the fact that both numeral and demonstrative forms
can also precede a possessive nominal. This is what is illustrated in (25a), with the
respective phrasal constituency tests in (25b-c):
25a. [o-ye
hãt-o
suto
unuro]NP apo-pe-ka
F-PROX NUM-F woman mother.of arrive-PFTV-PRED
‘This one mother of the woman has arrived’
b. [owa]NP apo-pe-ka
3SG.F arrive-PFTV-PRED
‘She has arrived.’
c. o-apo-pe
[o-ye
hãt-o
suto
unuro]NP
3F-arrive-PFTV F-PROX NUM-F woman mother.of
‘This one mother of the woman has arrived.’
Relative clauses constitute another type of constructions that show potential NP
properties, but which will only be properly described along with other subordinate
clauses in chapter 9, section 9.1.1. The examples in (26) briefly illustrate the fact that
relativized clauses can be replaced by pronouns in exactly the same way as NPs:
[ O
V-rel.s ]ClREL V
26a. kuku karota-karo
apo-pe-ka
man hurt-REL.F.POS.S arrive-PFTV-PRED
‘The (female) one who hurt the man has arrived.’ )
b. owa apo-pe-ka
3SG.F arrive-PFTV-PRED
‘She has arrived.’454In this work I will not attempt to describe how NPs containing clauses fit into the
general structure of NPs in the language. Although, as seen (26), it can be shown that
there are clauses in the language that have properties of a NP, the full details about the
properties of NPs containing a clause still remain to be described. Notwithstanding NPs
containing clauses, the structure of NPs can be represented as in (27):227a. NP →(DEM) + (NUM) + (NPPOSS) + N


PRO
(NPPOSS) + N

b. NPPOSS → PRO


Although constituting a troublesome theoretical concept, the notion of syntactic
head of a NP can nevertheless be motivated in Apurinã on the basis of two types of
evidence. The evidence allows us to argue that nouns or independent pronouns can be
such a head. The first piece of evidence comes from the fact that a noun or pronoun
within a NP can control the person and gender of the pronominal marker in the verb
within the same clause, or the gender of the numeral or of demonstrative forms within the
same NP. The examples in (16-25) illustrate these controlling properties of nouns inside
NPs. The additional examples in (28) show that it is in fact the noun within the NP that
determines the inflecting properties of the person marker in the verb:2There is one type of nominal construction formed of the juxtaposition of nouns, where the rightmost noun is
interpreted as an attributive modifier of the noun to its left. So, kema kuku (tapir man) will be interpreted as ‘male
tapir’, and kema suto (tapir woman) will be interpreted as ‘female tapir’. These constructions require further
investigation, since they have been attested with only one speaker, and since there is the possibility that this
particular speaker may have been highly influenced by similar constructions in Portuguese. For these reasons, I will
not discuss such constructions in this work.","[480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486]"
"612Chapter 10Concluding Remarks
In this work I have presented a somewhat typologically informed grammatical
description of the Apurinã language. In the first chapter the socio-cultural context where
the language is spoken was summarized. The group of Apurinã speakers is nowadays
mainly made of elders, and few of the children are learning the language. These
characteristics, in addition to the others described in the first chapter, place Apurinã
among the endangered languages of the Amazon region of Brazil.
As seen in chapter 2, the segmental phonology of the language is organized in
relatively simple terms. The language has a (C)(V)V syllable template and its
morphophonological alternations are restricted to the subject/possessor markers and a few
other bound morphemes. Stress is mostly predictably penultimate, although sensitive to
syllable weight —as determined by nasality and lengthening. Further research needs to
be done in order to explain the exceptions to the general patterns described in chapter 2,
especially with respect to the possibility of the same word form to vary in its primary
stress position. Only a tentative analysis was presented on intonation in Apurinã; more
research is necessary in the prosodic structure of the language.
Perhaps to compensate for the simplicity of the phonological system of the
language, its morphology is extremely rich. Bound morphemes abound in the language,
especially in the verb, with a great variety of functions. Due to this typological
characteristic of this language with respect to its morphological system, five chapters (36137) were spent describing, respectively, a general introduction to morphology, the noun
morphology, verb morphology, closed word class morphology, and special bound
morphology. It is this richness in morphological forms and their specific functions that
give Apurinã characteristics associated with so-called polysynthetic languages. Nouns
and verbs can be independently motivated as distinct parts-of-speech on morphological as
well as syntactic grounds. Adverbial and adjectival meanings, on the other hand, have
their typical functions expressed by means of bound morphemes or particles, in the first
case, and, in the second case, by bound morphemes, classificatory nouns and descriptive
verbs. Special bound morphemes are less than typical affix forms that can be classified
as floating, quasi-floating, or non-floating in terms of whether they occur with different
word categories or not. Aside from the floating characteristics of bound morphemes they
show the common property of occurring as the “outer”-most layers of bound morphemes
in their word bases. Moreover, some of them interact in special ways with syntactic
phenomena as, for example, the complementary distribution that is found between
subject/object pronominal markers and coreferential pre-verbal subject/object
expressions, or subject/possessor markers and free coreferential possessor expressions.
These particular properties of special bound formatives are comparable to properties
associated with independent words, thus making them behave as clitic-like forms. On the
other hand, the fixed linear position of special bound formatives is a property they share
with the more typical affixes found in the language.
Two features of the morphosyntax of the language can be considered somewhat
particular. First, certain inalienable noun forms are productively used as part of
compound nouns in ways reminiscent to numeral classifiers. Such nouns are used with
classificatory functions to refer to (or impose) semantic features related to the shape and
614consistency of the referent expressed by the compound noun. Not only that, these
classificatory nouns can also occur incorporated in the verb and, in this position, be used
with anaphoric-like functions. Second, the bound formatives can be seen as organized in
hierarchical “layers” that are motivated by the distribution of distinct sets of these bound
forms. From a cross-linguistic and theoretical perspective, while the description of
classificatory nouns can contribute to a better understanding of the ontology as well as,
perhaps, the ontogeny of classifying systems, the properties of special bound formatives
may serve as an inportant source of information on the interaction of syntactic and
morphological processes.
Since the present description of the Apurinã grammar is part of an on-going
research project, it was not possible to be equally specific about every part of the
grammar. As a consequence, chapters 8-9 describe only the major parts of the syntax of
the language. I should also note that the lack of a more detailed description of the syntax
of the language does not imply that there is little of specific behavior of forms that can be
characterized as syntactic in this language. Although it is the case that the Apurinã
syntax is not so much about inter-clausal operations, but much more about what happens
intra-clausally, much of the morphology of the language cannot be accounted for without
making reference to the clause or other clause-level elements.
To a great extent, the syntax of Apurinã consists of the functional or distributional
behavior expressed by bound formatives. The notions of a grammatical subject and a
grammatical object can be established partly on the basis of two paradigms of bound
pronominal forms, one used for subject and the other for object grammatical relations,
and the way these grammatical relations pattern in causative, reciprocal, reflexive and
relative constructions. Oblique grammatical relations are generally marked with oblique
615markers that attach to (pro)nominal forms. A VP constituent cannot be easily motivated
on the basis of language internal evidence and empirical grounds. Inter-clausal relations
can be marked with a few subordinator forms, but such relations are more often (in terms
of token as well as type sentences) expressed by juxtaposition —as is the case of sentence
conjoining.
Although Apurinã discourse-pragmatics and a detailed sociolinguistic description
of the language and its socio-cultural correlates have been left out of this study, they
constitute very important aspects of the language description that shall be part of future
revisions of this work. A part of the language where discourse and pragmatic factors play
a very important role is with respect to clausal constituent order variation, which is quite
free in the language. The socio-cultural variables that may play a significant role in
language variation may turn out to explain part of the “irregularities” attested in the
present description of the language grammar. Finally, in this work I have not attempted
to establish comparisons between Apurinã and other Arawak languages (except for the
preliminary reconstruction for Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari given in appendix D);
however, further investigation on diachronic developments in the grammar as well as
further typological-comparative work within Arawak might also shed new lights on
phenomena that seem to be arbitrary from a purely synchronic point of view.","[643, 644, 645, 646, 647]"
"283The verbs listed in the Table 2, however, are restricted to non-derived objective
descriptive verbs. As will be shown in section 5.3, the attributive markers pa- and kacan attach to root forms to derive objective descriptive verbs. Although a more
systematic study of the lexical semantics of objective descriptive verbs is required, I
should say that the semantic fields involved in derived objective descriptive verbs only
widens the range of properties referred to by objective descriptive verbs in general.
Finally, some of the verb forms listed in the Table 2 are the positive values of a
property; for these verbs, their negative values (i.e. their antonyms) are expressed as a
negation of the positive value. So, for example, the opposite of the verb hareka ‘be
good’ is kona hareka ‘be bad (not be good)’.
5.1.1.2 Transitive Verbs
Transitive (or bivalent) verbs differ morphologically from the general class of
intransitive ones insofar as only the transitive verbs can take both subject and object
pronominal markers. Transitive verbs are syntactically different from intransitive verbs
precisely in that only the former require the presence of both subject and object
simultaneously. Transitive verbs can be divided into regular transitive verbs and
(potentially) ditransitive verbs on the basis of whether their object can be marked by an
oblique marker or not. The example given in (4b) was an instance of a transitive verb.
Other examples are as given in (14), where nhi-, n- and nu- are subject pronominal
markers, and -ru is an object pronominal marker:
14a. nhi-nhika-ãpo-ta-ru
1SG-eat-RANDOM-VLBZ-3M.O
‘I went around aimlessly eating it.’284b. n-oka-ma-ru-ko
1SG-kill-FRUSTR-3M-FUT
‘I would have killed it.’
c. nu-taka-pe-ta-ru
1SG-put-pulp-VBLZ-3M.O
‘I put it (the fleshy thing) away.’
Solely in terms of their morphology, there is no basis for distinguishing bivalent
verbs from potentially trivalent verbs in Apurinã. The recipient argument of a potentially
trivalent verb can also be marked with object pronominal markers. So, the morphemes
-ru and -ro of the examples in (15) express the recipient of suka ‘give’:
15a. pu-suka-ru
2SG-give-3M.O‘Give (something) to him.’b. pu-suka-ro
2SG-give-3F.O‘Give (something) to her.’However, there are other types of differences between transitive and ditransitive
verb worth of note. In the next subsections I will describe properties indicating that both
regular transitive and ditransitive verbs can be analyzed as subclasses of transitive verbs,
under the definition of transitive verbs provided above. In distinguishing regular
transitive verbs from ditransitive verbs I will make use of the structural constituency
notion of “noun phrase”, which will be properly motivated later in chapter 8. For the
moment, “noun phrase” can be informally defined as the (pro)nominal free syntactic
expressions that are used to bear grammatical relations to the clausal predicator.
5.1.1.2.1Regular Transitive VerbsRegular transitive verbs are the most typical transitive verbs in the language,
insofar as they require both a (grammatical) subject and a (grammatical) object, wherein
285subject and object can be expressed as noun phrases, as a combination of noun phrases
plus the corresponding subject/object pronominal marker in the verb, or just as subject
and object pronominal markers. Regular transitive verbs constitute by far the great
majority of transitive verbs found in the language. In the following examples in (16)
(where underlining marks co-reference between the relevant arguments), the
(pro)nominal forms aõtu ‘umari fruit’, uwa ‘3SG.M’, maku ‘Brazil-nut’, and komeru-pe
‘manioc-pulp’ are all grammatical objects in the clauses they occur in; in (16d) the
subject is formally expressed as the pronominal marker a- ‘1PL’; and in (16e) both
subject and object are only manifested, respectively, as the pronominal markers a- and
-ru:
aõtu
16a. hãtako-ro apa-nanu-ta-ru
girl.F
fetch-PROG-VBLZ-3M.O umari(M)
‘The girl is fetching “umari” (fruit).’
b. o-atamata-ru uwa
suto
3F-look-3M.O 3SG.M woman
‘The woman, she looked at it/him.’
c. maku
ata apa
Brazil.nut we fetch
‘We gather Brazil-nut’
d. a-makatxaka txa-ru
komeru-pe
1PL-take.out AUX-3M.O manioc-pulp
‘We take the manioc pulp out.’
e. a-makatxaka-ru
1PL-take.out-3M.O
‘We take it out.’
In the examples in (16) subject/object pronominal markers are only found in the verb
when the subject/object NP is either post-verbal or absent in the clause. I will discuss in286further detail the correlation between post-verbal subject/object noun phrases and
subject/object markers in the next chapter, in 8.1.1.
5.1.1.2.2Potentially Ditransitive VerbsVerbs that translate as ditransitive (i.e. trivalent) verbs in other languages behave
like regular transitive verbs in Apurinã insofar as only the subject and one object are
structurally required to occur, and the third argument is structurally optional (i.e. the third
argument can be omitted without making the clause ungrammatical). The examples in
(17) illustrate the general case, namely that verbs that translate as ditransitive verbs in
some other languages, in this case as ‘to teach’ and as ‘to tell’ in English, behave as
regular transitive verbs in Apurinã (parentheses indicate that the expression is structurally
optional in the clause in which it occurs):
u-sãkire
(pita-monhi)
17a. mipake owara-pira-ta-ru
Mipake teach-language-3M.O 3M-language.of 2SG-GOAL
‘Mipake taught his language (to you).’
b. nota sãpire-ta-ru
tsora sãkire
(youkake-monhi)
1SG tell-VBLZ-3M.O Tsora language.of Youkake-GOAL
‘I told the Tsora story (to Youkake).’As shown in (17), the argument expressing the “theme” is obligatory and occurs as the
object of the verb, expressed by a “caseless” noun phrase, while the recipient argument is
optionally expressed by an “oblique” noun phrase. For the present purposes of this
section, a “caseless” noun phrase can be informally defined as a noun phrase without any
morphological case marker, whereas an “oblique” noun phrase can be described (also
informally) as a noun phrase marked with an oblique (case) marker. The description of
noun phrases will take place under 9.3.
287There is one ditransitive verb, i.e. suka ‘to give (away)’, however, that differs
from regular transitive verbs in two main ways. There are two special properties to be
noted about the Apurinã verb suka that make it a special case of transitive verb: The first
property is that only this ditransitive verb allows a third argument (representing the
recipient) to be expressed by a caseless noun phrase. So, for example, in (18) a
comparison is made between the verb for suka and etuka ‘to look’, where the former is
the special case of a transitive verb (i.e. a potentially ditransitive transitive verb) and the
latter is the typical case of transitive verbs (i.e. a regular transitive verb) in Apurinã:
18a. nhi-yowata-ne
pita nota suka
1SG-knife-POSSED 2SG 1SG give
‘I gave you my knife.’
b. *i-yowata-ne
pita nota etuka
2M-knife-POSSED 2SG 1SG look
(I watched/looked over his knife for him.)
In (18a), where pita ‘2SG’ and nhi-yowata-ne (1SG-knife-POSSED) ‘my knife’ are,
respectively, recipient and “theme” arguments, both (recipient and “theme”) arguments
are expressed by noun phrases, whereas (18b) is ungrammatical.
The second special property of suka is that, while regular transitive verbs take a
single caseless object noun phrase, with suka either the “theme” argument, represented by
a “caseless” noun phrase, or the recipient argument, expressed by an oblique noun phrase,
can bear the object grammatical relation, as indicated by what the object pronominal
marker agrees with, as the examples in (19) illustrate:
19a. o-suka-ro
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
3F-give-3F.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘She gave my arrow to him.’
288b. nota suka-ru
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
1SG give-3M.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘I gave my arrow to him.’
In (19a), the verb bears a feminine object pronominal marker, agreeing with the caseless
noun phrase representing the “theme” argument nu-serepi ‘my arrow’. In (19b), in
contrast, the verb bears a masculine pronominal marker, agreeing with the recipient
object, which is expressed by the oblique noun phrase uwa-mokaru ‘to him’
(morphologically described in chapter 7, 7.1.2.4). That is, insofar as pronominal object
markers can be considered to be the major formal marking property of the object
grammatical relation in Apurinã, the object of the ditransitive verb suka can be expressed
either by the caseless noun phrase representing the “theme” or by the oblique (or
caseless) noun phrase expressing the recipient. In the interest of focusing here on the
properties that regular transitive and ditransitive verbs share or do not share, I will
postpone to chapter 8 (in subsection 8.1.1.2, where the relevant type of grammatical
relations will be presented) further discussion on what it means for the recipient or the
“theme” semantic role to be marked as object in the language. General constraints on the
structure of clauses with potentially ditransitive verbs will be discussed in 8.3.
In sum, the examples in (18-19) show that the ditransitive verb suka differs from
regular transitive verbs in two ways: First, only this ditransitive verb allows for a
recipient argument to be expressed as a caseless noun phrase; and, second, the object of
this ditransitive verb denoting the recipient can be expressed either by a caseless noun
phrase or by an oblique noun phrase. On the basis of the distinctions just described, one
might feel motivated to postulate that transitive regular verbs and ditransitive verbs
constitute distinct general syntactic types of verbs, types that would be as different from
289one another as are intransitive and regular transitive verbs. There are, however, two
important reasons to analyze ditransitive verbs as a subclass of transitive verbs in
Apurinã. The two examples in (20) have in common the fact that only two arguments of
the verb are overtly realized in the clause: In (20a) nota ‘1SG’ is the object, since it is
coreferential with the object pronominal marker -no ‘1SG.O’, and in (20b) the only
formal manifestation of the object is the object pronominal marker -ru ‘3M.O’:
nota
20a. pu-suka-no
2SG-give-1SG.O 1SG
‘Give away to me.’
b. nu-suka-pe-ka-ru
1SG-give-PFTV-PRED-3M.O
‘I’ve given away to him.’
Examples such as those in (20) reflect a common property of ditransitive verbs,
namely that they only require two arguments to be (morpho)syntactically realized in the
clause, the subject and the (recipient) object; that is, they are only “potentially”
ditransitive. The examples in (20) also confirm what was already illustrated by the
examples in (19) (and underscored in chapter 5, in subsection 5.1.12). Only one nonsubject argument of ditransitive verbs is required in a clause, and, moreover, only one of
the non-subject arguments can be coreferential with the object pronominal marker in the
verb. Thus, insofar as ditransitive verbs require only two arguments and insofar as the
free standing expression that can be in an object relation (whether a “caseless” noun
phrase or an “oblique” noun phrase in post-verbal position) can be coreferential with the
same pronominal object markers in the verb as those that attach to regular transitive
verbs, they can be considered to belong to the same general category as regular transitive
verbs.
290Aside from the verb suka ‘to give’, there is only one other verb, namely, sukare
‘sell’, that appears to allow the recipient to be expressed either as a “caseless” noun
phrase or as an “oblique” noun phrase, as illustrated in (21).
21a. aiko mipake sukare-pe-ro
suto
house Mipake sell-PFTV-3F.O woman
‘Mipake sold the house to the woman.’
b. mipa sukare-pe-ru
aiko
mipa-mokaru
Mipa sell-PFTV-3M.O house(M)-AFFECT woman(M)-GOAL
‘Mipa sold the house to the woman’However, the verb sukare requires further verification, since the data available still do not
allow a conclusive analysis about the formal marking of its argument roles. Although it
is clear in (21a) that the verb sukare can take a third caseless noun phrase argument, the
example in (21b) is ambiguous as to whether the pronominal object marker is
coreferential with the caseless noun phrase argument aiko ‘house’ or with the “oblique”
noun phrase argument mipa-mokaru (since both contain a masculine noun). One of the
problems with sukare is that it expresses a concept that has been fairly recently
introduced into some of the Apurinã communities, and, as such, it is not consistently used
across large numbers of speakers or across speech varieties. As will be seen in
5.2.1.1.1.3, some speakers simply add the intransitivizer -rewa to the verb suka in order
to express the concept ‘to sell’. It is likely that the form sukare is a lexicalized form that
resulted from the reduction of suka-rewa-ta into sukare, going through some process of
reanalysis that still needs to be determined. In terms of their most general use, although
verbs such as suka and sukare can take both a “theme” and a recipient argument, these
verbs are most often found with only one of these two arguments morphosyntactically
291expressed —exactly as expected from a transitive verb. Issues related to when the object
of a ditransitive verb stands as a “caseless” noun phrase or as an “oblique” noun phrase
will be addressed in chapter 8, in subsection 8.1.1.2. Some restrictions apply to the
clausal distribution of the noun phrases bearing an object grammatical relation; such
restrictions will be described later in 8.3.
5.1.1.3 Presentational Verb
Constructions used to introduce a participant in the discourse generally make use
of the verb awa. In its presentational use awa translates as ‘there be’, as indicated by the
following examples. In the examples in (22) the nominal forms i-ye sãko ‘this “traíra”
fish’, nhiki-txi ‘game (meat of hunted animal)’, and yowata ‘knife’ occur as arguments of
the presentational verb:
22a. sãko awa?
traíra there.be
‘There is “traíra” fish.’
b. nhikitxi awa-ka-sawaku
game
there.be-PRED-TEMP
‘When there’s game…’
c. apoka-koru yowata awa
find-REL
knife
there.be
‘There’s a knife that was found.’
Although the presence of the third person object marker -ru in (22a) would seem
to suggest that awa takes an object argument, there are other syntactic properties
associated to this verb which still need to be better understood. As the examples in
(22a,c) show, the presence of the pronominal marker in the verb is not a obligatory. The
exact nature of the syntactic arguments of awa and the factor(s) that determine(s) the
292presence (or absence) of the pronominal marker in the verb are issues which are still
unresolved. The reason for this is partly because I have not done yet a careful survey of
the syntactic consequences of the (sub-)meanings of awa. For the purpose of this work, I
will simply list these (sub-)meanings here and leave for further research the decision as to
whether they reflect semantic properties of different (but homophonous) lexical entries or
whether they constitute semantic sub-variants of one and the same lexical entry. In
addition to introducing presentational constructions, the verb form awa can also be used
as a main verb with the meanings described and illustrated in the next paragraphs:
awa used with a sort of existential meaning, i.e. ‘to exist, live’, as in (23):23a. popũka-ru-wakoru awa-ru
Apurinã-M-PL.M
there.be-3M.O
‘Apurinã existed.’
b. kone kariwa
awa-ru
not
white.person there.be-3M.O
‘White people didn’t exist.’
c. aiko kone watxa awa-yoka
house NEG today there.be-NO.LONGER
‘The house no longer exists nowadays.’
It is true that there is a clear overlap between the existential meaning of awa, as
illustrated by the examples in (23), and its presentational meaning, as illustrated by the
examples in (22). In both the presentational and existential scenarios in which awa is
used, the verb predicates about the types of existences of what is referred to by its
argument. A very subtle difference is that in the cases illustrated in (23) the predication
is about a longer (more permanent or stable) existence during states or processes, whereas293in (22) the predication is about a shorter (more short-lived, momentary, accidental, or
casual) existence during states or processes.
awa used with locative meaning, i.e. ‘to live in, inhabit, reside’, to refer to inhabitancy or
other place circumstances, as in (24):24a. nu-wãka-tu-kata
1SG-namesake-big-ASSOC
‘I live with my namesake.’n-awa
1SG-there.beb. nha-monhi-pa
p-awa-ru
WH-GOAL-INT 2SG-there.be-3M.O
‘Where do you live?´
c. aiko here-ri-nhi

‘The cute house where the woman lives in collapsed.’
d. uwã-ra
ata wai awa-pe-ru
PTC-ESS 1PL here there.be-PFTV-3M.O
‘Then we stay here.’
awa used with possessive meaning, i.e. ‘to have’, as in (25):
25a. nha-pakunu-pa p-ãtenekoru p-awa
WH-plus-INT
2SG-children 2SG-there.be
‘How many children do you have?’
b. n-awa-ru
epi kanawa
1SG-have-3M.O two canoe
‘I have two canoes.’5.1.1.4 Auxiliary
The auxiliary verb txa is used with verbal predicates, following the verb and
serving as the “host” base for some of the material the main verb inflects for, as the294examples in (26) illustrate. In (26a) the auxiliary follows the verb akirita ‘to call’ and
takes the object pronominal marker; in (26b), the auxiliary follows the verb atama ‘to
look’ and takes the object pronominal marker; in (26c) the auxiliary follows the verb
form yotika-xiti-ka-ta ‘burn-field-INTENS-VBLZ’ and takes no pronominal marker; and,
in (26d) the auxiliary follows the objective descriptive verb form hareka-ko ‘be.goodFUT’:
26a. akirita i-txa-ro
owa
call
3M-AUX-3F 3SG.F
‘He called her.’
b. pitxeka i-txa
komeru
grow 3M-AUX manioc
‘The manioc grew.’
c. ata yotika-xiti-ka-ta
txa
1PL burn-earth-INTENS-VBLZ AUX
‘We burn well the farm field.’
d. hareka-ko
pi-txa
be.good-FUT 2SG-AUX
‘Be good.’
The form txa behaves as an auxiliary verb in that it adds no meaning to the
proposition expressed by the clause in which it occurs, and it usually carries part of the
bound formatives that would otherwise attach to the lexical verb form. txa is rarely found
in elicited material offered by Apurinã speaker as translations of Portuguese data, but it is
very commonly found in text material. Presently I have not found any grammatical or
semantic factor that determines when txa is used or not, nor have I been able to find any
grammatical or semantic motivation for when a bound formative will attach to the
auxiliary rather than to the lexical verb. Except for rare instances, the subject and/or
pronominal markers will attach to the auxiliary form when this auxiliary is present in the
295same clause. However, other bound formatives are more often found attached to the
lexical base rather than to the auxiliary.
The form txa can also be used as a main verb with various meanings, as described
and illustrated in the next paragraphs:
txa can be used to mean ‘to speak, to say’ introducing (or not) a direct or an indirect
quotation. This is the most common use of txa as a main verb attested in texts and is
illustrated in the following examples. In the first two examples below, (27a, b), txa
introduces direct quotations; in (27c) txa introduces an indirect quotation; and in (27d)
txa simply takes an object:
27a. kuku-ka-ne-ra-no
i-txa
man-PRED-ALSO-FOC-1SG.O 3M-say
‘He said “It’s a man that I also am.”’
b. Ø-oka-pe-no-na-ko
i-txa
kema owa-mokaru
3M-kill-PFTV-PL-FUT 3M-say tapir 3SG.F-GOAL
‘“They’ll kill me”, the tapir said to the woman.’
c. kuku-ka-ne-ra
uwa
o-txa-ru
man-PRED-ALSO-FOC 3SG.M 3F-say-3M.O
‘She said that he’s also a man.’
d. akirita i-txa-ro
owa
call
3M-say-3F.O 3SG.F
‘He called her.’
txa can be used as a copula verb to mean ‘to be’, as seen in (28), in which case the
reflexive marker -wa is also found in the verb:
28a. owa-kanera
suto
o-txa-wa
3SG.F-ALSO woman 3SG.F-be-REFL
‘She is also a woman.’296b. uwa-kanera
kuku i-txa-wa
3SG.M-ALSO man 3SG.M-be-REFL
‘He is also a man.’
Finally, txa can also be used to make reference to the lexical meaning of another verb
(normally found in the preceding discourse). It can be roughly translated as ‘do’, as
shown next:29a. a-txa-ru
ata kitxekapirĩka
1PL-do-3M.O 1PL formerly
‘We did it in ancient times.’
b. i-txa-ka-ta-ru
3M-do-INTENS-VBLZ-3M.O
‘He really did it.’5.1.2 Verbs with Incorporated Nouns
Verbs can incorporate a noun form which occurs adjacent to the verb root. So far
I have only attested incorporated nouns with transitive verbs. The incorporated noun
form can either be a regular noun (i.e. non-classificatory inalienable nouns and/or
alienable nouns) or a classificatory noun. As happens to any other forms that occur as
part of the morphological structure of the verb, incorporated nouns need to obey the
morphological rules for placement inside the verb. What this means is that incorporated
nouns also have one (and only one) slot in which they occur inside the verb and, for
reasons to be explained under 5.2.1.1, the presence of an incorporated noun in the verb
requires the presence of the verbalizer -ta (described under 5.2.1.1). The simplest
structure of a verb with an incorporated noun can be represented as in (30), where the slot
for the incorporated noun is the first position immediately after the first root in the verb,
297as represented by the underlined space: (Recall that BRt=Bound Root and FRt=Free
Root.)
BRt
30. V → FRt  + __ + ta
5.1.2.1 Verbs with Incorporated Regular Nouns
Verbs with incorporated regular nouns are verb forms that incorporate a noun
which expresses a semantic argument of the verb inside which it occurs. That is, certain
nouns when used as a syntactic unit expressing the argument of a verb can also occur
incorporated in the verb and still have the same semantic function as non-incorporated
nouns. This is illustrated in the examples in (31) and (32). In (31a), tapo-txi ‘arrow’
occurs non-incorporated as a syntactic unit expressing the notional object of the verb.
The same noun form occurs incorporated in (31b), also expressing the notional object of
the verb. The examples in (32) follow an analogous pattern, except that in (32a) the nonincorporated noun is possessed whereas in (32b) it is unpossessed —i.e. marked with the
unpossessor marker -txi:
pu-suka-ta-no
31a. tapo-txi
bow-UNPOSS 2SG-give-VBLZ-1SG.O‘Give me a bow.’b. pu-suka-tapo-ta-no
3F.S 2SG-give-food-VBLZ-1SG.O‘Give me a bow.’32a. nota pu-suka-ta-no
pu-tou
1SG 2SG-give-VBLZ-3M.O 2SG-thing‘Give me your goods.’b. pu-suka-toi-txi-ta-no
2SG-give-thing-UNPOSS-VBLZ-1SG.O‘Give me the goods.’298The semantic propositions expressed in (31a-b) are exactly the same, since in both
examples the incorporated and non-incorporated nominal elements express the “theme”
semantic role of the verb. However, syntactically the incorporated noun constitutes part
of a compound verb base within which it (the noun) plays no syntactic role, whereas the
possessor agrees with the pronominal object marker found in the verb, as do nominals in
object relation to the verb.
In the next pair of examples in (33), the nominal form yãkunu ‘footprint.of’
occurs non-incorporated in (33a) and incorporated in (33b):
33a. n-atama-ta ru-na
kema yãkunu
1SG-look-VBLZ-3M.O tapir footprint.of
‘I looked at the tapir’s footprint.’
b. n-atama-yãkunu-ta-ru
kema
1SG-look-footprint.of-VBLZ-3M.O tapir
‘I looked at the tapir’s footprint.’
The semantic interpretations of (33a-b) are the same, since in both cases yãkunu,
incorporated or not, is the possessed element in the clause. Here, again, the incorporated
element plays no syntactic function and the possessor element is cross-referenced by the
object marker in the verb. Therefore, the analysis of these incorporated nominal elements
can be described as a result of possessor raising where the possessor element acquires
syntactic properties of the syntactic object of the verb. The types of verb incorporated
regular nouns given above are not intended to exhaust all the types of regular noun
incorporation in the language. Instead, they simply illustrate the presence in the language
of regular noun incorporation, which can be contrasted with the classificatory noun
incorporation.","[314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]"
"591semantic role of its subject is converted into undergoer. The third column (and subcolumns under Polarity & Number) lists the morphemes that may mark cumulatively both
polarity and number. Finally, the fourth column (and sub-columns under Gender) lists
the morphemes for masculine and feminine. Notice also that, as is made explicit in the
table below, the major distinctions in the types of ClRELs can be described in terms of
distinctions of GRs & Voice, Polarity & Number, and Gender, thus producing tripartite
morphemic clusters. That is, at the same time that relative pronominal markers are
segmentable into three morphological markers (GRs & Voice, Polarity & Number, and
Gender), they also cluster together to function as relativizers.

-oWhen these tripartite morphemic clusters are contrasted to the way languages
generally mark ClRELs, they are found to be somewhat comparable to the relative
pronouns commonly found in European languages (Keenan 1985:149-152, Comrie
1989: 149-150, Givón 1990:656-658). Similar to relative pronouns, relative pronominal
markers in Apurinã occur inside the ClREL indicating the role of the headREL, and
functioning as subordinators. So, for example, the pairs -k-a-r-u/r-o vs. -k-u-t-u/t-o, in
Apurinã, and who vs. whom, in English, are both relative pronominal forms that occur
inside the ClREL, marking the headREL as subject and object respectively. The differences592between these two pairs are in their phonological status (as bound vs. free forms), in the
number of functional properties they encode (i.e. grammatical relation, voice, polarity,
number and gender in Apurinã vs. grammatical relation and animacy in English), in their
position inside the ClREL (i.e. following the verb in Apurinã vs. initial in the ClREL in
English), and, finally, in that only the Apurinã forms can also mark headless ClRELs.
Relative pronominal markers can also be compared with nominalizers, as the following
discussion shows.
9.1.1.6The Syntactic Category of the “Verb-REL” in Relative Clauses: Verbalor Nominal?
One final issue about ClRELs is with respect to the syntactic status of the verb of
the ClRELs as a result of taking the relative pronominal markers. (VREL is used hereafter
to refer to the verb of a ClREL.) In the description of the noun morphology in chapter 4,
relative pronominal markers are listed as relativizing nominalizers under 4.4.6. Since to
refer to the tripartite morphemic clusters marking the predicate of VRELs as both
nominalizers and pronominal forms suggests a misapplication of typical derivational-like
versus typical inflectional-like properties, some clarification is in order.
It is certainly possible for a language to make use of nominalizations to mark
ClRELs (Givón 1990:663-666)5. In Apurinã there are two major pieces of evidence that
the VRELs marked with the tripartite morphemic clusters listed in the table above are
nominalized forms: one morphological and the other syntactic. In the discussion that
follows, to say that VREL is “nominal” (or “deverbal”) or “verbal” means that VREL can5Where examples from Turkish, Ute and Lhasa Tibetan are cited.","[622, 623, 624]"
"4.6 General Syntactic Properties of Nouns
As a syntactic unit, nouns can differ in various ways from other parts of speech.
For example, I have shown above (4.1) that nouns divide into alienable, inalienable and
mixed nouns in Apurinã, something which is true of no other part of speech. In terms of
their formal expression, this means that no other part of speech but nouns can take any of
the possessed/unpossessed markers illustrated above or be placed in juxtaposition to form
a possession construction. We saw in 4.4.2 that potential exceptions consist of the cases
in which the possessed marker -re1 attaches to a verb base (as in xika-re1 [sing-POSSED]
‘song’, kama-re1 [make-POSSED] ‘work’) and nominalizes such a base. The same
happens when the unpossessed marker -txi attaches to a verb base (as in nhipoko-ta-txi
[eat-VBLZ-UNPOSS] ‘place for eating’). Thus, aside from nouns no independent
pronoun or any other part of speech will subcategorize for possession or unpossession
marking in the language, and when the possessed and unpossessed markers -re1 and -txi,
respectively, do occur with verbs, such markers have slightly different functions. To the
extent that possession/unpossession marking is also a syntactic (aside from
morphological) phenomenon in the language, it constitutes a distinctive syntactic
property of nouns.
An exclusive property of nouns that follows from their possibility of taking
possession/unpossession marking is their consequent distributional property as the head266possessed element in a possession construction. That is, no other part of speech can take
the place of a possessed noun in a possession construction. Although this distributional
property is a direct implication from the possession marking property of nouns, it can be
described separately because there was the logical possibility that other parts of speech
could perhaps acquire by inheritance the possibility of occurring as the possessed head.
As was shown in 4.4.1, nouns are also lexically or morphologically marked as
feminine or masculine, and this grammatical property of nouns can not only be reflected
in the form of the noun itself (when the noun takes a morphological gender marker) but
also in the cross-referencing marking patterns found in other words in the language and
controlled by the noun the other word agrees with. The only other word that also encodes
gender as part of its meaning is the independent pronominal form for third person
singular. Thus, except for this pronominal form only nouns subcategorize for gender.
Other properties that can help in distinguishing nouns from other syntactic
categories include the morphological distinctions provided in 4.5, under the assumption
that “[l]exical category [i.e., part of speech] is as much of a notion of morphology as one
of syntax, in that what an item is inflected for provides sufficient grounds for assigning it
to a lexical category” and that, therefore, “[t]he differences in syntactic behavior of the
different lexical categories serve in part to allow compliance with morphological
requirements.” (McCawley 1988:183). The qualification “in part”, however, is an
important one since not all morphological marking properties have syntactic
consequences, or, as was shown in chapter 7, not all morphological marking properties
that are syntactically relevant are sensitive to the parts of speech distinctions (although
one can argue whether the latter cases really constitute part of the morphology rather than
solely of syntax). Finally, the last set of properties that can distinguish nouns from other
267parts of speech consists of the way they can combine with other words in phrasal
constructions and the way they can stand by themselves as a phrase. These last properties
will be described in detail in 8.3.1.","[297, 298, 299]"
"NRt+CN2?‘fat Mipa’As will be seen in 4.4.9, some former and current CN2s appear to be in the
process of becoming grammatical morphemes, as shown in the next set of examples.

morphemes.

The nature of CN2s could easily be regarded as “uninteresting” if, as it tends to
happen at a first glance, one associates CN2s to the unproductive use of compound words
such as those with the morpheme berry in English. The association, though well taken, is
misleading when it ignores the properties of CN2s which the morpheme berry lacks in
English. To the extent that berry occurs in English as part of compound nouns referring
to fruits of a small size (e.g., cran-berry, straw-berry, mul-berry, blue-berry, rasp-berry,
black-berry and so on), it resembles, for example, the CN2 ku ‘seed of, kernel of; small179and round’ in Apurinã. However, as was said above, neither can berry be metaphorically
extended nor can it incorporate into verbs in anaphor-like constructions.
In fact, grammatical and discourse roles of CN2s pervade the Apurinã language.
In the context of discourse there are clear instances of CN2s being used in productive
compounding to DISAMBIGUATE MEANING. One example is the attested use of the
noun komuru in a text about the making of manioc flour. By itself komuru can refer to
‘manioc bulb’, ‘manioc tree’, or ‘manioc bread’. However, when the textual context does
not allow to discriminate the meaning, CN2s are added to disambiguate meaning, as whenkomuru-katu is used to refer to ‘manioc tree’, when komuru-mata is used to refer to
‘manioc flat bread’, when komuru-poroi is used to refer to manioc ‘round (ball like)
bread’, and so on. CN2s can also be used to HIGHLIGHT INTRINSIC/CONTINGENT
SEMANTIC FEATURES of noun references, such as size, dimension, shape or
consistency. I learned this by being myself subject to their use. My name in Apurinã,yowuka, was consistently pronounced as yowuka-ke by one of the speakers I worked
with. When I asked another speaker why I was being called yowuka-ke, instead of
simply yowuka, by the other speaker, I was told (after a few laughs) that “It’s because
you are skinny and tall [of course, within the Apurinã standards].” That is, CN2s are also
used in discourse to play the role of ATTRIBUTIVE MODIFIERS, which is typical of
adjectives or descriptive verbs in many other languages.
Both of the discourse roles played by CN2s in productive compounding,
disambiguating and highlighting meanings, are also attested for CN2 incorporation. For
example the word for ‘manioc mush’ is attested in texts as the productive compounding
180komuru-pe, in which case -pe not only qualifies the ‘mushy’ and ‘paste’ consistency of
the ‘manioc mush’, but it also discriminates ‘manioc mush’ from ‘manioc bulb’, ‘manioc
tree’ etc. Approximately the same disambiguating or attributive function can be
accomplished by simply incorporating the CN2 -pe into the verb; as in the example
below:
41. (komeru(-pe))
ata oka-pe-ta
manioc(-pulp of) we throw-pulp-VBLZ
‘We thrown the (manioc) mush in.’
The fact that the noun to which the verb incorporated CN2 refers can be omitted, and
most often is, suggests that, when CN2 incorporation is used somewhat anaphorically, the
discourse participant whose properties the incorporated CN2 refers to is BACKGROUND
DISCOURSE INFORMATION. Another piece of evidence for this discourse property is
the fact that incorporated CN2s are widely used to make reference to discourse
participants mentioned repeatedly in the same text. Finally, there are many cases in
which a subset of incorporated CN2s narrow the meaning of the verb. For example, the
verb yatarota by itself means ‘to mix’; but when the CN2 for liquid things, a, is
incorporated, as in yataro-a-ta, the meaning becomes ‘to stir a liquid thing’. Thus, the
function of CN2s when incorporated approximates the function of what Mithun (1986a,
1986b, 1984) describes as incorporated classifiers (or verbal classifiers). This
similarity to a certain type of classifier, however, does not hold grammatically when
CN2s are used in nominal compounding (see 4.2.1).
As to the frequency of CN2s in texts, in five texts of different genres, two
procedural texts, two narratives, and one dialog, CN2s were attested in only three, these
181were the two procedural texts and one of the narrative texts. Of the three texts, Text 1
was a procedural text about how to make manioc flour; Text 2, the second procedural
text, describes how to prepare a special type of tobacco powder for inhaling; and Text 3
was a narrative about the story of a young woman who is kidnapped by a tapir. The
distribution of CN2s in the texts are given in Table 12:

FLAT, WIDEA first look at the text distribution of CN2s suggests that they are more likely to
occur in procedural texts, since no CN2 were used at all in the second (unrelated)
narrative or in the dialog. It would seem that CN2s are likely to be used when certain
physical features of what is being described are important in conveying the thematic
information, or simply when highlighting some descriptive aspects of what is being
talked about. Other distributional results of counting CN2s, observable in Table 12, are
as follows: While 4 CN2s were used in noun compounding a total of 24 times in Text 1
182(procedural), and while 4 CN2s were used 7 times in noun compoundings in Text 2
(procedural), only 2 CN2s were used 7 times in Text 3 (narrative).
In the same 3 texts, incorporated CN2s have a distribution which is close but not
exactly similar to that of compounding CN2s. Incorporated CN2s were most frequent in
Text 1 (procedural), about how to make manioc flour, less frequent in Text 3 (narrative)
about the story of the woman who was kidnapped by a tapir, and even less frequent in
Text 2 (procedural) about how to prepare the tobacco powder to be inhaled. This first
approach to the frequency of CN2s leaves as result an open possibility for a distinction in
distribution between CN2s in compoundings and CN2s in incorporation, which needs to
be checked against a more representative body of text. Nevertheless, keeping the limits
of the data sample in mind, it may be worth noting how CN2s are distributed in
compounding and incorporation in the same texts. As seen in Table 12, with the
exception of Text 2, when the same CN2 occurs in noun compounding as well as in
incorporation, it tends to be more frequent in incorporation. This preliminary result may
be one more manifestation of the role that incorporated CN2s play in discourse as a
formal expression of highly topic references, in a manner reminiscent of pronominal
elements.
Finally, there are two other correlations attested in the three texts mentioned
above: First, of the set of CN2s that are found in productive compounding, only a smaller
set is more often used in incorporation. This is not an artifact of the type or size of data
contained in the three texts used here, as the same is attested in additional data. Second,
there seems to be a tendency to incorporate CN2s (used anaphorically) that are
monosyllabic. On this, it is important to note that in Table 12 the CN2 muna is reduced to
mu when incorporated into the verb.
183Doris Payne (1987) attempted to typologize the classifying systems attested in the
Amazon region of South America, with the finding that there were problems for the
opposition between classifiers and noun class/gender systems suggested by Dixon (1986)
with certain classifying systems which happened to share properties of both types. In a
more recent work, Grinevald (a.k.a. Craig, in p.c.) suggests the following typology for
classifiers:

"7.3. The Category Status of Special Bound Formatives
The purpose of this subsection is to discuss the arguments to be constructed on the
basis of the data presented so far (but not yet systematically discussed as to what they
mean) for treating special bound formatives as a special category of morphological units.
While such special morphological units can be shown to resemble the more typical affix
units (as the ones described in chapters 4-6) in terms of their distribution in the base they
attach to, they can, nonetheless, be distinguished from typical affixes in at least two
ways: first, in terms of their positioning outside of the more typical affixal morphology
described in chapters 4-6, and, second in terms of their “floating” distribution in the
clause and/or the way in which they interact with phrasal or clausal constructions. The431analysis of the status of special bound formatives as an extension of morphological
strategies (rather than as a result of purely syntactic operations) has a twofold motivation:
On the one hand, it follows from my perception of a general trend in Apurinã, namely to
make use of morphological strategies to encode functions that apply at the level of the
phrase or clause; and, on the other hand, it is partly inspired in Anderson (1992, and
references there cited, especially chapter 8) —although I do not make use of the formal
descriptive language nor necessarily of all axioms that accompany that framework. The
discussions in chapter 8 of Spencer 1991 and in chapter 3 of Sadock 1991 were also
helpful in organizing the content of this section.
I have so far intentionally avoided making use of the term “clitics” here due to the
various meanings associated with it, and have chosen instead to work with languagespecific labels. As a consequence, the distinctions being made here are clearly motivated
by language internal factors. After all, as Sadock points out, “[t]he elements we call
clitics are often characterized by a constellation of properties from diverse grammatical
realms”, among which he lists the following:
58. Sample of wide range of properties associated with clitics, as given by Sadock (1991:52):
“I. Morphology
a. Clitics are bound morphemes.
b. They attach outside inflection.
c. They block further morphology.
d. They attach without regard to the morphological class of the host.
e. They are completely productive.
II. Syntax
a. Clitics are independent elements of syntax.
b. They are syntactically adjacent to their morphological host.
III. Semantics
a. Clitics are semantic functions.
b. They take the meaning of a phrase as argument.
IV. Phonology
a. Clitics are phonologically dependent.
432b. They are agglutinative.
c. They are stressless.
d. They are subject to automatic phonological rules only.
V. Lexicon
a. Host plus clitic forms are not lexicalized.
b. Clitics alternate with free words.”
Clitics are defined over the property that some word-like elements have of being
prosodically deficient. Among the various attempts to establish a typology of clitics, the
one most often referred to in the literature is by Zwicky (1977). Zwicky classifies clitics
into three types: simple clitics, special clitics, and bound words. A simple clitic “is an
element of some basic word class, which appears in a position relative to the rest of the
structure in which the normal rules of the syntax would (or at least could) put it”
(Anderson 1992:200). A special clitic “is one whose position within some phrasal unit is
determined by principles other than those of the non-clitic syntax” (Anderson 1992:201202). Bound words “are the words which don’t correspond to a full form and thus can’t
possibly be analyzed as reductions of ‘real’ words, but which nevertheless need a host
and in some cases are restricted to a particular sentence position” (Spencer 1991:376).
Perhaps the best candidate for a simple clitic among the special bound formatives
are the subject/possessor pronominal markers as well as the object pronominal markers.
The special property of the subject/possessor pronominal markers (including here the
plural marker, described in 7.1.13, that is in dependency relation with the third person
plural subject/possessor marker), as shown in 7.1.1, is that they are in complementary
distribution with coreferential pre-verbal nominal expression bearing the subject in a
clause or the possessor in a possession construction. So, these pronominal forms are able
to replace nominal expressions in some specific distributional and functional contexts,
namely as pre-verbal subject free expression or as possessor free expression. However,
433one first difference from simple clitics is that the pronominal markers, when used as
subject or as object markers, are in complementary distribution ONLY with pre-verbal
free coreferential nominal expressions, but NOT with postverbal free coreferential
nominal expressions (as shown in 7.1.1 and in 7.1.12). Another difference is that,
although the phonological similarity between subject/possessor pronominal markers and
independent pronouns is quite clear, they have partially different functions, since while
the former can only be used with subject or possessor function, the latter can be used with
subject, object or possessor function, as represented in Table 6:

relations, or yet bear the possessor relation (as described in detail in chapter 6, in section
6.1), the subject/possessor pronominal markers can be used to bear the subject or the
possessor, but NOT the object (as described earlier in 7.1.1). Since independent
pronouns and bound pronominal markers show some partial distinction in their
grammatical meaning, the latter cannot be described as phonological reductions of the
former —although there is likely to be a diachronic link between the two sets of
pronominal forms. Therefore, subject/possessor pronominal markers cannot be described
as simple clitics, that is, as simple phonological reductions of the independent pronouns.","[462, 463, 464, 465]"
"349Independent pronouns can replace nominal constructions functioning as the syntactic
expressions of subject/object or the possessor. The structure and distribution of such nominal
constructions will be described in chapter 8, in 8.1. Various examples given above can be used
to illustrate the use of pronouns as words replacing nominal constructions. For example, the
noun form hãtako-ro ‘girl’ in (4) can be replaced by its pronominal counterpart owa ‘3SG.F’ in
(5):
4a. hãtako-ro umaka-nanu-ta
youth-F sleep-PROG-VBLZ
‘The girl is sleeping.’
b. hãtako-ro unuro
iri-pe
youth-F
mother fall-PFTV
‘The girl’s mother has fallen down.’
5a. owa
umaka-nanu-ta
3SG.F sleep-PROG-VBLZ
‘She is sleeping.’
b. owa
unuro iri-pe
3SG.-F mother fall-PFTV
‘Her mother has fallen down.’
Pronouns differ syntactically from nouns in that they do not subcategorize for the things nouns
subcategorize for, except for gender —which third person singular pronouns also distinguish (as
was earlier illustrated in 1c-d, 2c-d, and 3c-d). Another difference (which will be further
described in the discussion on the structure of noun phrases in 8.1.1) is that a pronoun cannot be
the possessed head element of a possession construction, as indicated by the ungrammaticality of
(6):
6. *hãtako-ro owa
iri-pe
youth-F 3SG.F fall-PFTV
‘(The woman’s it/her has fallen down.)’
350The use of independent pronouns is determined by either grammatical or discourse
factors, or by a combination of both. Example of a grammatical factor is the oblique noun
phrases (described in chapter 8, in 8.1.1.2. Since oblique noun phrases are generally marked
with an oblique marker (see 7.1.2), and since oblique markers can attach to phonologically
independent elements only, independent pronouns but not pronominal markers can occur with an
oblique marker. So, while the example in (7a) is grammatical, the one (7b) is ungrammatical
because, in the latter, the associative oblique marker -kata (see 7.1.2.2) occurs with a bound
pronominal marker, rather than with an independent pronoun.
n-una-ru
7a. uwa-kata
3SG.M-ASSOC 1SG-come-3M.O
‘I came with him.’
b. *u-kata
n-una-ru
3M-ASSOC 1SG-come-3M.O
(‘I came with him.’)
The discourse factors that determine the use of independent pronouns cannot be described
in any detail in this work for two reason: first because the discourse structure of Apurinã will not
be dealt with here and, second because preliminary evidence suggests that there is no one or two
discourse factors that can account for the use of independent pronouns in discourse, but instead
there various discourse categories that need to be taken into account. What I will do then is to
list some of the most obvious discourse factors that have been observed, and which can be found
in the text given in Appendix B. While reproducing examples from Appendix B, for easy of
illustration, I will preserve the numbering and format given there.
8. Independent pronouns used to mark significant (e.g., unexpected) changes in the plot of
narratives, in which case, in general, a co-occurring coreferential pronominal marker is also
351found in the same sentence. In 005 the independent pronoun owa ‘3SG.F’ refers to the young
woman, and is used to mark the fact that, contrary to what one would normally expect of her, she
went just by herself to watch the tapir eat the “uxi” fruit in the jungle:

9. Independent pronouns are used in appositive constructions in highlighting the presence/role of
a participant in discourse. In 006 uwa ‘3SG.M’ is used with the coreferential appositive nominal
form kema ‘tapir’ in a context where the narrator describes the daring action performed by the
tapir, namely to kidnap the young woman:

text in Appendix B (see 006, 021, 025, 033, 034, 036, 039, 041, 046, 050, 078, 084,086, 087,
091).
10. Independent pronouns are used to reintroduce a participant as a cataphoric topic into
discourse. In 049 unawa ‘3PL’ refers to the hunters, whose previous mention had been made to
eight clauses earlier in 041. unawa is used in 049 to reintroduce the ‘hunters’ into the discourse,
after a parenthetical description of the state of the young woman had been made (from 042 to
048 in Appendix B).

Facundesfor the degree ofDoctor of Philosophyin the Department of Linguistics to be taken January 2000Title: THE LANGUAGE OF THE APURINÃ PEOPLE OF BRAZIL
(MAIPURE/ARAWAK)A somewhat typologically informed grammatical description of the Apurinã
language is provided, including historical, socio-cultural, demographic and geographic
information about the Apurinã society. The Apurinã communities spread along
tributaries of the Purus River, in western Brazilian Amazon. The grammatical analysis
consists of the phonology, morphology and syntax, with appendixes on language
variation and the design of the Apurinã ortography, a text sample, a vocabulary list, and a
preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari. The grammatical analysis is
based on language internal factors, though with some typological observations on major
aspects. The segmental phonology is simple; morphophonemic alternations are restricted
to pronominal subject/possessor markers and a few other bound morphemes. Stress is
predictably penultimate, though with exceptions that need further investigation.
Although a preliminary analysis of prosodic structures is suggested, more work is
required in this area. The morphology is complex and includes special bound forms
which are partially distinguishable from typical affixes. Nouns and verbs are clearlyxxviidistinct syntactic categories; however, property-referring words are describable as a
subclass of intransitive verbs. Classificatory nouns are used as part of productive noun
compounding and a subset of them can be verb-incorporated and refer back to physical
and shape properties of participants previously mentioned in the discourse —in this way
resembling verb incorporated classifiers of North American languages. The description
of the syntactic organization of the language involves, to a great extent, examining the
functions and behavior of bound morphemes, and reaches its highest complexity in the
system of relative clauses. A subset of property-referring words, called objective
descriptive verbs, presents a morphologically marked split intransitivity system which is
partly based on the semantic class of these verbs. Such a system is typical of Arawak
languages. The constituent order is semi-free; the VO order is the most frequent in texts,
but the patterns of word order correlations point to OV. Overal, the Apurinã language
constitutes a laboratory for examining the interplay between morphological forms and
syntactic structure and functions, providing certain grammatical and semantic categories
and structures that resemble only in part those attested in other languages.xxviiiList of Abreviations and other Conventions UsedA

1.0. Introduction
The purpose of this dissertation is to present a preliminary grammatical
description of the Apurinã language. Apurinã is spoken by the Apurinã indigenous
people of the Northwestern Amazon region of Brazil. The Apurinã population may vary
in number depending on the parameters used to identify as Apurinã a person of Apurinã
ancestry living out of contact with an Apurinã community. Intra-culturally, these
parameters may be determined by the extent to which this person (and/or others in his/her
environment) is aware of his/her Apurinã ancestry. Sometimes, a person may claim the
Apurinã ancestry for potential government help (poorly) provided to indigenous peoples.
The dissertation is organized as follows: Chapter 1 is the introduction, where
some general information on the language and the people who speak it is presented;
chapter 2 presents the phonemic inventory, articulatory phonetics and phonological
analysis of the language, in addition to the orthographic system for the language; chapter
3 presents an introduction to Apurinã morphology where the major concepts used in
chapters 4-7 will be introduced; chapters 4-6 present the morphology of the noun, verb
and closed word classes in that order, and the their relevant syntactic properties; chapter 7
presents a special set of bound morphemes that share properties of affixes as well as of
independent words in a clitic-like fashion; chapter 8 presents the constituent structure
1analysis of phrases and the clause, an analysis of grammatical relations, predicates and
the syntactic properties that operate at the level of simplex sentences; chapter 9 presents
the structure of complex sentences; the conclusion summarizes the major aspects of the
Apurinã grammar covered in this work and points to parts of the grammar that deserve
further investigation. Appendix A summarizes some general information on issues
involved in the design of the Apurinã orthography and on a general picture of dialectal
variation. Appendix B provides a text sample consisting of an Apurinã traditional story.
Appendix C provides a vocabulary sample of the language. Finally, appendix D presents
a summary of a lexical comparison involving Apurinã and its closest extant languages,
Piro and Iñapari to arrive at a preliminary phonological reconstruction of Proto-ApurinãPiro-Iñapari.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]"
"Problems Related to StressAs the previous subsections show, the data on stress examined so far allow for
interesting and reasonably clear-cut generalizations (even constituting nice examples to
be used in introductory courses to Phonology). However, it would be perhaps too good if
there were no noteworthy deviations to the general patterns described above for stress
marking. The problems noted in the next paragraphs partly reflect the on-going nature of
the research on prosody summarized in this work, and they are the major reason to
classify the analysis presented here as a preliminary one.
The first reason to be cautioned about generalizing the analysis presented above
for the whole language has to do with language variation. The data used here for the
analysis of stress, in spite of being detailed, are mostly based on the speech variety found
in the Japiim village of the Paciá River (13 in Fig. 2 of chapter 2). This means that a
more systematic examination of data from other Apurinã speech varieties still needs to be
done.
The second reason is related to some cases of variation in the culminative stress
marking pattern found among speakers of the same speech variety or even in a single
speaker. That is, some individual speakers allow for some variation in the position of the
primary stress in a group of words in a way possibly analogous to the way that allophones
in free variation can fluctuate. This can be illustrated with the following words in (110).
In each of these words the same speaker pronounced the same words, repeating one after
the other, alternating the prominence between the penultimate and the ultimate syllable:
110a. [k.pa.ti] ~ [k.pa.ti]
b. [.tu.pa] ~ [.tu.pa]‘earth, clay’
‘jungle’
107c. [pa.ri.a.ti] ~ [pa.ri.a.ti]‘work, labor’d. [a.p.k.ri] ~ [a.p.k.ri]‘""urucum"" fruit’e. [pa.pa] ~ [pa.pa]‘go fetch (it)’f. [i.ki.ri] ~ [i.ki.ri]‘nose of’Although it is true that the words in (110) are more often expressed with higher
prominence on the penultimate syllable, the fact that the alternation above is possible is
nonetheless worth noting. The words in (110) are the only attested instances where the
same speaker uttered the same words, repeating one after the other, alternating the stress
position. In contrast to (110), the words in (111) exemplify cases where the stress
alternation between penultimate and ultimate syllables also occurs, but in these latter
cases the words were either uttered by different speakers (from the same village) or by
the same speaker in a time interval of several hours or days between each occasion in
which the words were uttered. These examples in (111) then show that it is NOT the case
that the stress shift from penultimate to ultimate position only happens when the words
are repeated one after the other at short time intervals:
111a. [s.r] ~ [s.r]‘toy’b. [ka.pi.i] ~ [ka.pi.i]‘squirrel’c. [i.ju] ~ [i.ju]‘bat’d. [me.ri.ti] ~ [me.ri.ti]‘peccary’e. [e.s] ~ [e.s]‘rainbow’
108f. [a.i.ju] ~ [a.i.ju]‘mosquito’g. [e.pi] ~ [e.pi]‘two’i. [i.ri] ~ [i.ri]‘""coró"" rat’j. [n.s.ka] ~ [n.s.ka]‘I give (it)’k. [i.w] ~ [i.w]‘its flower’If I knew nothing else about the Apurinã language, the first thing to come to mind
would be that I might be hearing (with ears trained by a stress based Romance language)
as prominence what could be best characterized as pitch, and that I might be possibly
dealing with a tonal language. However, knowing by now that amplitude and frequency
(i.e. pitch) normally combine to characterize prominence in the language, and that
frequency cannot be independently used as a distinctive phonological property, I have no
choice but search for an alternative account of the data above. In building such an
account, I can start by underscoring the fact that for all the instances of stress alternations
listed in (110) and (111), in addition to the 33 other attested cases (out of a total of 50 in a
database of over 1,000 Apurinã words from the Japiim village), and with the rare
exceptions noted below, the norm is for the word to take penultimate, not ultimate, stress.
The first of the rare exceptions to the predominant penultimate primary stress is
the name of the most sacred Apurinã mythical entity, i.e. [tsu.ra] (briefly described under
1.1.4.4). The second exception is made of a few trisyllabic compound words that take the
bound form [-mna] ‘log’ (see 4.1.1.2.2 for a more precise semantic description of
[-mna]). In (112a) the word for ‘firewood’ is an instance where invariably the primary109stress is penultimate; and in (112b) the generic word for ‘tree’ is more often
antepenultimate, although I have also attested rare instances of speakers making it
penultimate. That is, the words in (112) are exceptional in that the first of them NEVER
takes penultimate stress and in that the second takes more often antepenultimate stress:
112a. [a.mna] ~ *[a.mna]
b. [a.mna] ~ [a.mna]‘tree’
‘firewood’’The example in (113) is given to show that it is NOT the case that the bound form
[-mna] necessarily triggers the antepenultimate stress in the word form it attaches to:113. [jE.jE.:m)na]‘bat’Although Pickering (1971:7-8), having confronted what appear to be analogous
problems, doubted whether the exceptions to the general culminative penultimate were
predictable, there are good reasons to believe that most (if not all) of them are. If one
took for granted Pickering’s perception of the data, the result would then be to consider
stress as phonemic —although Pickering mentioned a low functional load of stress, in the
language. Most of the arguments I have presented above lead to the conclusion that, to
the contrary, stress is not phonemic. There are two ways that I will consider in
accounting for the exceptional examples presented in this subsection; one consisting of a
general functional principle and the other consisting of various independent phonological
processes and grammatical processes.
The first account follows from the simple fact that, as already mentioned earlier,
stress is never used as the only phonetic or phonological property to distinguish two or
110more words in the language and, also, that stress is easily predictable for the
overwhelming majority of the cases. From a naive point of view one may suggest that if
stress is not used to distinguish words then it is likely to carry very little functional load
in the language; and if it carries little functional load speakers may feel free to vary as to
the position where the highest prominence falls. That is, speakers/hearers would not
detect distinct levels of prominence —as they also do not detect the phonetic properties
of allomorphs that are in free alternation. Following this account, whatever is the
functional-cognitive principle that explains why speakers normally cannot distinguish
among allomorphs in free variation, this same principle would explain why Apurinã
speakers would not hear degrees of prominence in their language. The first problem with
this account, however, is that I am not aware of any description of a language that
suggests that stress can work in this manner; another, more serious, problem is that the
culminative penultimate stress itself is a good evidence that speakers can actually hear
the difference in prominence. One way to try to salvage the analysis, nevertheless, would
be to argue that speakers do hear the prominence distinctions but that they can simply
disregard it at times simply because there is very little functional load to it in the
language. The problem with this addendum to the naive functional approach, however, is
that the trochaic foot analysis suggested in the previous section indicates that stress
position is essential for the structure of prosodic words and, as a consequence, to define
the Apurinã rhythmic structure.
The second account to the exceptions to the culminative penultimate stress is that
there actually are phonological and, in very few cases, perhaps, grammatical,
conditioning, factors that determine the variation in the position of the primary stress.
That is, the exceptional examples described in this subsection would result from
111phonological (or grammatical) rules in ways analogous to the way that word final heavy
syllables determine the ultimate stress. It is this cluster of phonological and grammatical
rules that are still under investigation and, hence, cannot yet be fully described in this
work. To mention some of the mechanics used in this second account, let me provide
some examples. Consider the variation in stress for the words for ‘bat’, [i.ju] ~ [i.ju],
and for ‘“coró rat”’, [ki.ri] ~ [ki.ri]. Each of these pair of words can be replaced with
[i.ju.k] and [ki.ri.k], respectively, where [k] is used with things of a smallish and
roundish shapes. (The semantics of [k] is described under 4.1.2.2 of chapter 4.) For
some speakers the bound form [k] behaves as an unremovable part of the name of these
animals. It would appear that either the potential presence of [k] would trigger the
ultimate stress or that [k] is actually an obligatory part of these names, and that such
noun forms have been shortened by one syllable (a process independently found in the
language, as seen under 4.4.8, in chapter 4), but that the original position of the stress is
maintained. This shortening process would account for a number of the exceptions given
above. Following the same path, other phonological processes, sometimes interacting
with grammatical ones, (both types still under scrutiny) suggest that the exceptional cases
to the general stress marking patterns are deviations that do not occur at random, but that
can be predicted in most (if not all) the cases.","[138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143]"

Thus, once we have added CN2s to the typology of classifying systems, it comes
as no surprise to note DeLancey’s suggestion of the existence of a continuum from pure
noun to pure classifier, and that such continuum can be observed in the syntactic and
semantic behavior of certain nouns and classifiers. Such a continuum has been attested in
the form of class terms in some South-East Asian languages. CN2s in Apurinã then
would constitute another manifestation of similar continuum, this time in an Amazonian
language.
4.1.1.2.4Remarks on the Semantic Nature of C(lassificatory)N(oun)2sIn the previous sections we have seen that Apurinã has CN2s; that CN2s are the
recurrent elements in productive noun compounding; that some CN2s can be used as
anaphor-like nominal elements that can be incorporated into the verb in a manner similar
to certain verb incorporated classifiers; and that CN2s play important grammatical roles in187the morphology, syntax and the lexicon of the language, as well as that they can
encompass important discourse and pragmatic roles.
In the analysis presented above for CN2s, I have suggested that there is enough
synchronic evidence pointing toward a continuum within which the nature of CN2s can
be understood. When we look at CN2s in productive compounding by isolating parts of
this continuum based on observable differences in their semantic or syntactic behavior,
we identify parts of the mechanisms by which lexical meaning “emerges” as a result of
language use and language variation. In terms of their semantic properties, we have seen
that CN2s have two sources currently attested: most CN2s derive from plant parts/nature
elements, and a few others derive from body parts. The fact, however, that there are too
few instances of the latter cases does not allow us to discard the possibility that further
investigation may reveal that all CN2s have plant parts/nature elements as source
meanings. Moreover, CN2s occur as one of the elements in a productive noun compound
and they refer to anatomical properties of the derived meaning of the compound. Thus,
CN2s may refer to semantic properties of nouns which fall into two or three of the
following meaning categories: (i) plant parts/nature elements (as source meaning), (ii)
body parts (as derived meaning and, perhaps, also as source meaning), (iii) manufactured
elements (as derived meaning).
Based on the descriptive information above, two important questions can be asked
about CNs:
I - What is the motivation which may lead the same CN2s with the semantic field
in (i) to be used to refer to the semantic field in (ii) and/or in (iii), or those with the
semantic field in (ii) to refer to the semantic field in (iii)? Furthermore, can we say188anything on why the source semantic field is (i) rather than (ii), when the converse seems
to be more well attested crosslinguistically?
II - In terms of the semantic internal structure of CN2s, which are the semantic
properties that are preserved or abandoned as CN2s have their meaning extended with
accompanying semantic bleaching?
The semantic development of CNs suggests a number of semantic changes that
can be explained through metaphorical extensions of particular source meanings into
particular target meanings. One type of semantic change observed was that which occurs
when plant parts have their meaning extended to refer to body parts. In contrast, another
semantic change occurs with the extension of meaning from plant parts to manufactured
elements. For instance, there is a sense in which the use of -muna in ãã-muna ‘tree’ is
different from its use in kiri-muna ‘animal’s nose’; and the use of -muna in aiko-muna
‘house bean’ is different from both of the previous uses. In the first case, -muna refers to
the properties of a plant; in the second case, -muna refers to the properties of a body part;
and in the third case, -muna refers to the properties of a manufactured element. Is it the
case that, in the three cases, -muna carries the same meaning properties? If yes, then
what are these meaning properties? Are the various uses of -muna a case of polysemy or
homonyny?
As Sweetser points out “[n]o historical change of meaning can take place without
an intervening stage of polysemy. If a word once meant A and now means B, we can be
fairly certain that speakers did not just wake up and switch meanings on June 14, 1066.
Rather, there was a stage when the word meant both A and B, and the earlier meaning of
A eventually was lost” (1991:9). In that view, -muna could be, conceivably, treated as an
instance of polysemy. Now, does this help us answer question I or II posited above?
189How can we show that each instance of -muna in words like ãã-muna ‘tree,’ aiko-muna
‘house beam,’ kiri-muna ‘animal nose’ etc... corresponds to different word meanings that
happen to be expressed in the language by the same phonological form? If we followed a
strict version of the polysemy view, we would end up having to accept a lexicon
consisting of lexical entries such as -muna1, -muna2, -muna3, -muna4, -muna5 etc... which
when applied to the other CN2s of the language would generate a close to infinite number
of lexical meanings the language learner would need to memorize. This certainly is not a
desirable result. If on the other, we assume that there is enough similarities among the
various uses of -muna that justifies to treat them as semantically related in some way, we
find ourselves in the position of having to show which “similarities” those are.
Question I could be answered if we made use of the some sort of cultural mode
underlying the use of CN2s. We may take CN1s (i.e. plant parts/nature elements and
perhaps body parts) to constitute the set of semantic properties expressing a source
domain, whereas CN2 (manufactured elements) would constitute a target domain. In
order to understand, express or conceptualize elements within the target domain,
elements of the source domain are used. The meaning of CN2s would emerge out of the
mappings between image-schematic models containing “specific schematic images,
such as trajectories or long, thin shapes or containers” (Lakoff 1986:31). There would be
three of such image-schematic models involved here, one for (i) plant parts/nature
elements, another for (ii) body parts and, finally, a third for (iii) manufactured elements.
These mappings could be characterized as metaphoric mappings within a metaphoric
model (idem), in which elements from one image-schematic model maps onto another
one, as (i) maps onto (ii), (i) maps onto (iii), and (ii) maps onto (iii), as in the diagrams
below:

ELEMENTSFig. 6: From Body Parts to Manufacture Elements
Apurinã then would have conceptual mappings of a sort that motivate the
meaning alternation of CN2s. As a first approximation, Apurinã could be said to have the
following global conceptual metaphoric mapping:
THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ANIMAL BODIES/MANUFACTURED
ELEMENTS ARE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PLANT PARTS OR
NATURE ELEMENTS.
Fig. 7: Generic Metaphoric Model
A version of such a conceptual metaphorical mapping in Apurinã could be
grounded on the Apurinã cosmology wherein plants and non-human animals are treated
as the same sort of beings —as attested in the Apurinã creation mythology. Thus, what
we would be finding is that there would be a generic metaphoric model embedded into an
Apurinã idealized cultural model (or an Idealized Cognitive Model, see Lakoff 1987)
which would work to motivate the use of certain semantic domains in connection with
other semantic domains, in this case, the semantic domain of plant parts/nature elements
191in connection with that of body parts (Fig. 4), or of plant parts/nature elements in
connection with that of manufactured elements (Fig. 5), or the semantic domain of body
parts in connection with that of manufactured elements (cf. Fig. 6). Within this semantic
analysis, CN1 and CN2 can be treated as items that constitute a natural category (see
Lakoff 1982); their commonality consists of the similarities perceptually identifiable in
their semantic contribution to the derived compound noun, such similarities consisting of
shape and/or consistency. Physical shape and consistency are the general set of semantic
features making an anatomical image-schematic model that, once made available to the
speakers, can be extensively used with CN2s with functions beyond that of a simple head
of a noun compound. That is when CN2s can be used as modifying elements with
attributive function in nouns or in verb incorporation.
In order to answer question II, we need a more detailed analysis of the semantic
features (properties) of CN2s; we need to specify the shape and consistency properties
involved in the mappings posited in Figures (4-6). In order to motivate the properties of
CN2s in terms of image-schematic mappings, we need to specifically describe which
particular properties are being mapped between domains. That is, it still remains to be
said which of the several different “physical properties of Plant Parts/Nature Elements”
are associated to the “physical properties of Body Parts/Manufactured Elements,” and so
on. This is what is dealt with in the next paragraphs.
A semantic analysis of the data allows us to make sense out of the descriptive
facts by positing schematic models which would motivate the association of the semantic
fields given in (i)-(iii) above. Such an analysis also allows us to note that it is the
perceptually salient physical properties inherent to (i) and/or (ii) that are mapped onto (ii)
and/or (iii). However, we have only been able to account for the semantic classes whose
192properties are associated to one another (through metaphorical mappings), and to
motivate only one very general set of properties involved in the semantic mappings,
namely the set of “physical salient properties.” The obvious question then would be
“How do we know which properties are salient?” One way to find the answer to this
question would be to perform psycholinguistic experimental tests such as those used in
Prototype studies à la Rosch 1977. Another possibility would be to use linguistic
information through a structural analysis of the data. It is the structural analysis that
follows below.
The CN2 -muna can be used to illustrate how the data presented in the paper
indicate that it is that the most salient features inherent to the source domain (i.e. CN1)
turn out to be preserved in the target domain (i.e. CN2). As we have already seen
above, -muna can only be used with plant parts names (when used with the plant
parts/nature elements category) to refer to trees with large trunks. It is generally the case
that such large trunks have as salient perceptible properties the fact that they are ‘thick,’
‘rigid,’ and ‘cylindrical’. Hence ‘thick,’ ‘rigid’, and ‘cylindrical’ can be naturally
interpreted as the salient source meaning properties of the CN2 -muna. Now, having
established the source salient properties of -muna, we can examine which of such
properties remain or are lost when -muna is used to refer to body parts or manufactured
elements. As seen in the Table 13 below, the ‘rigid’ property is lost when used to refer to
body parts, but maintained when used to refer to manufactured elements. Thus, the
recurring properties of -muna across categories are ‘thick’ and ‘cylindrical’.
In Table 13, I extend the analysis for each CN2 in order to illustrate the recurring
properties which can be observed when CN2s refer to the shape or consistency of plant
parts/Nature Elements, body parts, and manufactured elements. Hence, in Table 13 we
193track the original salient properties for each CN2 as such properties are preserved or lost
when the CN2s are used with any of the relevant noun categories. As a result, we arrive
at the (presumed) “core” properties, that is, meanings that may recur across categories, as
summarized in Table 14.
Thus, in Table 14 the “core” properties can conceivably be taken to be the
specific features which are mapped from the source to the target domains which were
represented in Figs. 4-6.","[217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225]"
"134As a result of having only two open classes of words, the language presents a rather
rich variety of subclasses for each of the open classes. Each of these subclasses will also be
described in detail along with their super-ordinate class. Finally, three notions that are
directly relevant to open classes of words are base, root and stem —introduced next.
3.4.1.1Base, Root and Stem
The terms “root” and “stem” are probably among the most traditional words found inthe morphological literature. Implicitly or explicitly, “root” is generally used to name the
minimal lexical base (where ‘lexical’ means pertinent to the open class of words, and “base”
is a any word form to which formatives attach) which (sub)category changing bound
morphemes can attach to, or as the lexical base that expresses the core meaning of an open
class word; whereas “stem” is generally used to name the morphological base which
(sub)category maintaining bound morphemes attach to (Anderson 1985a:6, 1992:71,
Spencer 1991:5). The use and definition of these terms follow from the general tendency for
(sub)category maintaining bound morphemes/processes to occur outside (sub)category
changing bound morphemes/processes, and vice-versa; or, in other words, the tendency for
(sub)category changing morphemes to occur closer to the root, and for the (sub)category
maintaining morphemes to occur farther from the root.
In this description of Apurinã, the notions of “root” and “stem” are particularly
useful for the morphological description of nouns; they will be defined over the types of
bound forms that attach to them. The types of bound forms attaching to a root nominal base
and of bound forms attaching to a stem nominal base will roughly correspond to those
associated with derivational and inflectional morphology, respectively. However, since the
closest the modern theories of morphology have come to when trying to distinguish135derivation from inflection has been to argue that such notions can only be defined on a
theory internal basis, I will avoid such labels here. Instead, I will make use of the more
neutral terms (sub)category changing and (sub)category maintaining bound forms, and
make some brief comments about the extent to which they translate into the notions of
derivation and inflection, respectively.
A brief illustration of the notions just introduced can be seen in (10). The form
nhipoko ‘food’ in (10a) is shown to be the minimal base a word can be decomposed into, i.e.
a root. (10b) shows that the category changing nominalizer (and possessed marking) suffix
-re can attach to the root base to form another noun form. In (10c), we can see that a
category maintaining suffix, in this case the instrumental marker -ã ,can attach to the root+re
word base to form a noun “inflected” as an instrument. The base root+re which the
instrument marker attaches to is then an instance of a stem.
10a. *ata [nhipoko]ROOT
1PL food(our food; we eat)b. ata [nhipoko]ROOT –re
1PL food-POSSED‘our food’c. ata [nhipoko-re]STEM –ã
1PL food-POSSED-INSTR‘in our food’The examples in (10) are a simplified illustration of the way the morphological
notions introduced here help to describe the grammar internal to word forms. A much more
detailed description is presented in chapters 4-7, including subtypes of root and stem forms
not discussed here.","[165, 166, 167]"
"Oblique Markers
Oblique markers are the special bound formatives that attach to the rightmostnoun or pronoun in phrasal constructions and bear peripheral grammatical relations to the
predicator in the clause. Thus, these oblique markers occur as part of elements that bear
the sort of peripheral grammatical relations generally marked with adpositions in
languages that have prepositions or postpositions. Like postpositions, these oblique
markers occur after the forms they attach to; also like postpositions, oblique markers
occur with nouns or with pronouns. However, different from postpositions, they are
phonologically attached to a word base. Insofar as they are integrated into the
morphological structure of their host base and insofar as they mark peripheral
grammatical relations, oblique markers bear formal and functional resemblance to casemarking affixes in languages with a system of case markers. The next subsections will
385present the meaning/function of oblique markers in terms of the internal structure of their
hosts. The survey of oblique markers presented below covers most of those attested in
the language. There may be a few additional cases, but they require further verification.
7.1.2.1.","[416, 417]"
"434As to the object pronominal markers (described in 7.1.12), they are also different
from independent pronouns both in their phonological form and in their function. While
object pronominal markers can only be used with object function, independent pronouns
are used with subject, object or possessor function, as represented in Table 7:

phonological reductions of the independent pronouns. Furthermore, although object
pronominal markers are restricted to verb forms, they share with the subject/possessor
pronominal markers the special property of being in complementary distribution with a
pre-verbal coreferential argument expression —which, however, must bear the object
(rather than the subject) grammatical relation.
The best candidate for a special clitic among the special bound morphemes are the
oblique markers (described under 7.1.2). What is of interest to us here are the scope
properties of oblique markers. In the following examples the associative marker -kata
(identified in 7.1.2.2) is used to illustrate the general properties of oblique markers. In
the example in (59a) the construction nota hãke-ru ‘my son’ is shown to function as the
subject of the verb apo-pe ‘arrive-PFTV’. In (59b) it is shown that the oblique marker
-kata can occur attached to this nominal construction:43559a. nota hãke-ru2
apo-pe
1SG child.of-M arrive-PFTV
‘My son has arrived.’
b. hãtako-ro nota hãke-ru2-kata
apo-pe
youth-F
1SG child.of-M-ASSOC arrive-PFTV
‘The young woman has arrived with my son.
Notice that the semantic scope of -kata is the whole nominal construction nota hãke-ru2,
not just the last word in this nominal construction.
Examples such as these, however, do not constitute sufficient evidence that the
oblique markers are in any way words rather than morphological units. The fact is that,
for being a phonologically bound formative, they need to attach somewhere. The best
evidence that we could have would be to find a construction with a postnominal
modification, and see where the oblique marker would go. The only type of postnominal
modification found in the language are the relative clause constructions and, as it
happens, the oblique maker does go in the postnominal modifier rather than in the noun
being modified, as illustrated by (60) with the oblique marker -mokaru ‘GOAL’:
60. i-txa
kema owa
hãtako-ro Ø-anhi-kuto-mokaru
3M-say tapir 3SG.F youth-F
3M-take-REL.F.O-GOAL
‘The tapir said to her, the woman whom she took away.’
However, although examples such as (60), where the goal oblique marker attaches to the
relativized verbal construction, can be found in text material, I have not been able to find
similar examples for other oblique markers. Even in translating examples from
Portuguese, speakers do not offer examples with oblique markers other than -mokaru
attaching to the predicate of relative clauses or complement clauses. This may indicate
that -mokaru is unique in attaching to deverbal constructions, aside from nouns and
436pronouns. Regardless if one decides to use the syntactic properties of oblique markers to
argue that they constitute special clitics in the language, it is important to recognize that
there is an important interaction between morphological and syntactic properties as far as
these markers are concerned. By recognizing this interaction we may be better able to
understand the sort of atypical properties of the word structure and/or atypical properties
of the clause structure. However, since Apurinã lacks any corresponding free form which
oblique markers can be compared to, it is not possible to show that the placement of such
markers in the clause is determined in any way by a syntactic rule different from that
determining the placement of corresponding free words.
Finally, an analysis of all special bound formatives as bound words which lack a
(phonologically) free corresponding form is, in principle, possible, though, as I will
suggest, undesired. Since all special bound formatives require a host base to lean on, and
since they all lack a corresponding free form, they all resemble bound words (except for
the still unclear “passive” marker). That is, (quasi-)floating special bound formatives
resemble bound words in that they can occur in two or more host bases; the object
markers, though constituting a non-floating special bound formative, resemble a bound
word in that they are in complementary distribution with pre-verbal coreferential object
free expressions; and, the gerund marker resembles a bound word in that it marks a whole
clause as subordinate, rather than just the verb itself, thus, in a way analogous to free
complementizers in some other languages. The fact, however, is that clear cases of
bound words were presented in chapter 4 as a subset of classificatory nouns. So, a
classificatory noun such as ku ‘seed, kernel; small and roundish’ behaves like a noun in
the language in that it can take a possessed marker such that u-ku [3M-seed/kernel] will
mean ‘its/his seed/kernel’. As was shown in chapter 4, only nouns can take pronominal
437markers functioning as possessors. However, ku is different from typical nouns in that it
can never stand by itself as a free word form, thus behaving as a noun that is
phonologically bound. Special bound formatives, on the other hand, can never take a
possessed marker.
On the basis of the description of special bound formatives as elements that are
integrated into the word structure, the structure of nouns and verbs given in (1-2), can be
revised as in (61). In (61a) N’ is the complex noun form that is formed of the nouns
described in chapter 4 plus the relevant special bound morphemes (SBM). In (61b) V’ is
the complex verb form that is formed of the (non-descriptive) verbs described in chapter
5 plus the relevant special bound morphemes:438N’

The next subsections briefly illustrate some formatives that are likely to constitute
additional instances of special bound formatives, but that, for being rarely used presently
in the language or for being restricted to one or more speech varieties, still cannot be
described in detail in this work.","[465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471]"
"148Chapter 4Nouns
4.0. Introduction
This chapter describes the word internal structural properties of nouns and their
syntactic properties, distinguishing the noun subcategories present in the language. The
grammatical bound formatives that are described in this chapter as part of the
morphological structure of nouns are those that only occur as part of noun bases.
Apurinã also has affix-like forms that occur outside of the morphological formatives
inherent to nouns. The majority of such morphological forms belonging to this outerlayer morphology can occur not only with nouns but, also, with verbs, pronouns and/or
other closed word classes (depending on the relevant case). In this chapter, I will
concentrate on the description of inherently nominal bound formatives, postponing the
description of non-inherently nominal affix-like forms to chapter 7, where they will be
described as a special class of bound formatives.
The grammatical properties described in this chapter for nouns will motivate the
following nominal categories:11Unless it is necessary to distinguish the general word class from its particular subclasses, I will be using the term
“category” to refer to a general word class or to its particular subclasses such that, for example, “noun” and “simple
noun” will be both be referred to as a “(noun) category”.","[179, 180]"
"4.4.8 Other Processes of Noun Stem Formation
In addition to the noun stem formations given above there are others, less
productive or of more limited use in the language. The first one is realized through some
sort of “reduplication” of onomatopoeic forms, where the derived nouns refer to the
animal or phenomenon that produces certain sounds, and where the phonology of these
nouns results from an iconic representation of such sounds. As the examples in (98)
illustrate, the appearance of reduplication is a result of the way speakers/hearers represent
what they hear; it does not constitute true reduplication in that the forms that result from
separating the formally similar parts of these onomatopoeias do not stand as formatives
that can be found as part of other words:25098a. mẽko-mẽko-ru1
mẽko-mẽko-3SG‘thunder’b. toro-toro
toro-toro‘type of big frog’c. nhao-nhao
nhao-nhao‘type of large seagull’Another process included here for forming noun stems where some partial
regularity can be found involves certain proper names assigned to women. A few proper
names for women coincide in ending in /ero/, as the examples in (99) are illustrative of:
99a. irarĩero
wild.pig.F‘(woman´s name)’b. komarĩero‘(woman´s name)’c. yakonero‘(woman´s name)’d. mayoripero‘(woman´s name)’e. mirĩero‘(woman´s name)’f. nanãxiero‘(woman´s name)’g. nainero‘(woman´s name)’h. irĩero‘(woman´s name)’Notice that, aside from /ro/ in /ero/ coinciding with the feminine gender marker -ro
(described under 4.4.1), there is no other grounds for positing /e/ and /ro/ as distinct
formatives. It is of interest in these examples, however, that the form irari in irarĩ-ero
coincides with the word for ‘wild pig’ (and the nasalization of the last vowel could follow
from the allomorphy rule given in (18) of chapter 3). Such examples have been presented
here for the sake of completeness, as they are restricted to just a few cases and could as
251well be handled by semi-regular rules of analogy (such as, e.g., some version of lexical
redundancy rules) stored in the lexicon of the language. It is, nevertheless, worthy of
note that some noun stems may take the form of conventionalized onomatopoeic forms.
One last way to form noun stems in Apurinã is shortening. I will only mention in
passing this process here because, for one reason, I have not done any systematic
investigation of it, and, moreover, the little of what I have seen of it indicates it may be
limited to a few instances, or even to a few registers. Shortening can be defined as a
morphological process by which an otherwise unanalyzable word (or an unanalyzable
part of a word) is phonologically reduced. The examples in (100) are illustrative of this
shortening process:
100a. anãpana-ru1 > anãpa
dog-3M
dog‘(male) dog’b. kãkutu > kãku
person
person‘person’As far as I can tell, shortening is less common in Apurinã than, for example, in some
registers of English (cf. professor > prof, cigarettes > cigs, graduates > grads,
grandmother > grandma etc.)4.4.9 Notes on Augmentative versus Diminutive Noun Forms
The purpose of this subsection is to show that although the functional opposition
augmentative versus diminutive is NOT grammatically encoded in the language by any
systematic/specialized form, it can nevertheless be expressed in ways, some of which
may soon get grammaticalized. That is, there is no specific affixal form that can be
classified as strictly an augmentative or a diminutive marker. However, since such a
252functional opposition can be encoded by particular set of morphemes, even if not
completely systematically, it is worth describing it. The unproductive and less than
systematic behavior of the suffix forms described below justifies including them among
the processes of noun stem formation.
A noun has at least two ways to be marked as augmentative, namely by the
suffixation of -powa or -tu. Further historical comparative analysis may reveal that these
two forms evolved out of classificatory nouns (described under 4.1.1.2).
Synchronically, -powa and -tu simply derive a noun of larger than average proportions
for the referents of the nouns they occur with, as seen in (101):
101a. kema-powa
tapir-big‘big tapir’b. mipa-tu
Mipa-big‘big Mipa’As to the diminutive function, there are at least four forms to mark it. They
are -peku, -tuku, -ku, and -ta.25 Note that -ku and -ta are both instances of classificatory
nouns, the first referring to ‘seed; things of a round and small shape’, and the second
referring to ‘things of a roundish edge’ (both described under 4.1.1.2.2). -peku was the
only one mentioned in Pickering 1971:30, there presented as -puku for the dialect he was
describing (i.e. from the Tawamirim village, village 14 in the map in Figure 2 of chapter
1). It is possible that -tuku is formed by -tu (also used to mark augmentative) plus the
classificatory noun -ku ‘seed; thing of a small round shape’, both synchronically
lexicalized into one affixal form. (Aikhenvald [p.c.], however, notes that Tariana has a25The extent to which the use of some of these forms is specific to certain dialects remains to be verified. –ta, for253similar diminutive suffix, namely tuki.) As shown in (102-105), these affixes derive noun
forms whose referents are smaller than the average size:
102a. kuku-peku
man-DIM‘little man’b. tata-peku
umari-DIM‘little “umari” fruit’103a. pataru-tuku
chicken-DIM‘little chichen’b. kema-tuku
tapir-DIM‘little tapir’104a. amarunu-ku
boy-DIM‘little boys’b. kaseroro-ku
white.one-DIM‘little white one; white kernel’105a. putetu-ta
clay.plate-DIM‘(small) plate’b. kopiti-ta

"35613a. u-kira hãtako-ru
M-DIST youth-M
‘that boy’
b. o-kira hãtako-ro
F-DIST youth-F
‘that girl’
In this analysis of demonstratives the initial forms “i, u” and “o” from i-ye or u-kira and
from o-ye or o-kira correspond, respectively, to a bound pronominal form that means ‘3M’
(wherein “u”=/i/ that changes into /i/ by the palatalization rule given in (12), in 3.6.1), and to a
bound pronominal form that means ‘3F’. Analyzing the initial vowels in the demonstrative as
person-gender markers leads us to conclude that -ye is a formative whose meaning is
‘PROXIMATE’, and that -kira is a formative whose meaning is ‘DISTAL’. When modifying
plural nouns, demonstratives may neutralize the masculine-feminine gender distinction in favor
of the masculine form, as the examples in (14) indicate:
hãtako-ro-wako-ro
14a. u-ye
M-PROX youth-F-PL-F
‘these girls’
b. o-kira hãtako-ro-wako-ro
F-DIST youth-F-PL-F
‘those girls’There is so far no evidence that demonstratives take any additional morphological
structure aside from those just described. Moreover, for at least some speakers, demonstratives357are different from pronouns in that the former cannot replace nominal expressions playing the
role of arguments of the verb, as the ungrammatical examples aim to show:5
15a. *nhi-potxi-ta-ru
i-ye
1SG-like-VBLZ-3M.O M-DEM
(I like this)
b. *nhi-potxi-ta-ro
o-kara
1SG-like-VBLZ-3F.O M-DEM
(I like that)
However, some conflicting information may indicate that this property of demonstratives
may not be true for all Apurinã varieties. That being the case, the analysis presented here will
work for the relevant varieties. The property that demonstratives have of modifying nouns, in
addition to their distribution, gives them an independent syntactic status, distinguishing them
from other closed word classes.
In addition to u-/o-kara, there is another form, namely wera, that is also used to mean
‘DISTAL’. At the present time I have not attested any distinction between these two forms. The
second one, i.e. wera, requires further verification with different speakers in order to determine,
for example, whether it is not limited to certain speech varieties. It is clear, however, that, as
shown in (16), wera does not inflect for the gender of the noun it modifies:
16a. wera
suto
DISTAL woman
That woman…’
b. wera
kuku
DISTAL man
‘That man…’5This, however, is not true of all speech varieties.","[387, 388, 389]"
"3.2.3Phonological versus Grammatical Word: Where Do TheyDiffer?
As I briefly mentioned above, the phonological and grammatical criteria defining
words produce word forms that almost always coincide. There are only two criteria I have
attested so far where there is a potential disagreement between a phonological and a
grammatical word: The first is the result of the minimal word requirement, and the second
is the type of boundary separating phonological/grammatical words.
The result of the minimal word requirement is that a word cannot have less than two
moras; or, in other words, that a word has a minimum of two syllables or one heavy syllable.
126The problem is with the verbs sa ‘to go’ and txa ‘AUX; say; do; be”. These two verb forms
can potentially be used without any additional bound form —as, for example, in its citation
form. Although this particular use of these two verbs has not been clearly attested in natural
speech, their occurrence in elicited text justifies maintaining the distinction between
phonological and grammatical words. For the purpose of the grammatical description of the
language it is the grammatical, not the phonological, word that is relevant, although the
notion of phonological word is also an important one.
As to the boundary factor, there is one clear instance where phonological rules that
apply at the boundary of phonological words but not at the boundary of a particular type of
grammatical words. This is the case of the shortened form of the independent pronoun for
first person singular nota, i.e. no#. As was described in chapter 2, subsections 2.1.2.5 and
under 2.5, /h/ is deleted in postvocalic environments. As was illustrated in 2.1.2.5, and
repeated below in (8), the /h/-deletion rule only fails to apply when /h/ is preceded by the
shortened form of the independent pronoun nota, i.e. no#:
8a. [nota himarota]‘I know’b. [i-imarota]‘I know’c. [no#himarota]‘I know’d. [o-imarota]‘she knows’I should also note that although it is the case that all independent pronouns can also be
shortened, no# is the only shortened pronominal form that occurs systematically enough and
independently of speech rate.","[157, 158]"
"5.3.3 Privative Reversal Marker: wẽThe privative reversal wẽ- is a morpheme that with a somewhat elusive function,
especially because it is rarely used. The few examples so far attested suggest that it
cancels/reverses the negative meaning of the descriptive verb forms it attaches to. This is
illustrated in (85), where in (a-b) the morpheme cancels the negative meaning of the
deprivative marker, and in (c-d) where it cancels the meaning of the independent negative
particle:
85a. ma-wẽ-ere-tu
PRIV-REV-be.pretty-3M.O‘He’s pretty’b. ma-wẽ-ere-to
PRIV-REV-be.pretty-3F.O‘She’s pretty’338c. kona pa-wẽ-ere-ro

not ATTR-REV-be.good-3M.O‘He’s very nice’5.3.4 Final Remarks on the Morphology of Descriptive Verbs
There are some indications that certain class1 bound forms can also occur with
descriptive verbs, but this requires further investigation. The structure of a descriptive
verb can be represented as in (86), although certain combinations do not occur due to
semantic incompatibility:
86. ATTR/PRIV-REV-Rt5.4. General Syntactic Properties of Verbs
A verb in Apurinã can be distinguished from nouns as well as from other parts of
speech in terms of various syntactic and morphological properties which are specific to
verbs. The morphological distinctions between nouns and verbs, for example, consist of
the inherently nominal or verbal morphological structures described in chapter 4 (for
nouns) and in the previous sections for verbs. The remaining morphological structures of
verbs and nouns (not described in this or in the previous chapter) are the special bound
formatives that either are NOT inherently verbal or nominal, respectively, or they interact
in special ways with clausal or phrasal structures. These special bound formatives will be
described in detail in the next chapter.
A major syntactic distinction between nouns and verbs is manifested in the formal
expression of the sub-categorization for core semantic relations, which is specific to
339verbs. Although this sub-categorization per se can be described as lexical semantic
properties of verbs, its formal expression is structured in syntactic terms. For example,
the root form nhipoko- occurs in (87a) with the unpossessed marker -ru2 to form a noun
that expresses the subject of the verb hareka ‘to be good’. In (87b), the bound root
nhipoko- occurs with the possessed marker -re2 to refer to the possessed element in a
construction where the possessor is expressed as nota ‘1SG’:
87a. nhipoko-ru2
hare-ka
food-UNPOSS be.good-PRED
‘The food is good.’
b. nota nhipoko-re2
1SG food-POSSED
‘my food...’
c. *nota nhipoko-ru2
1SG food-UNPOSSED
(My food; I eat)
d. nota nhipoko-ta
1SG food-VBLZ
‘I eat.’
As follows from the syntactic description of nouns presented above, (87a-b) illustrate two
of the syntactic properties of nouns. The example in (87c) shows that nota cannot be
interpreted as the syntactic expression of a possessor or a subject when occurring with
nhipoko- marked by the unpossessed suffix -ru2. The reason why nota in (87c) cannot be
interpreted as subject follows from the presence of the unpossessed marker -ru2 (as
described in detail in 5.1.2), which makes the bound root into a noun, not into a verb. As
a noun, nhipoko-ru2 does not subcategorize for subjects. Moreover, as shown by (87d),
only verbs subcategorize for grammatical arguments (such as, e.g., subject) and, hence
allow for their syntactic expression in a clause. That is, (87d) is a grammatical clause
340because the verbalizer -ta has been added to nhipoko-, thus forming a verb (in this case
an intransitive one) that, like any non-objective descriptive verb in the language, requires
a subject. Exceptions to this pattern will consist of the class of non-verbal predicates
(described in 9.2.2), but in which cases certain constraints on such predicates take place
to transform non-verbal predicates into the sort of exceptions that only confirm the
general property described here for verbs.
The following examples are given to show that the syntactic difference between
(87b) and (87c) is also reflected in the distributional behavior of their constituting
elements. So, (88a) is ungrammatical while (88b) is perfectly grammatical because
arguments of a verb can occur pre- as well as post-verbally, whereas the genitive of a
possessive construction can only occur preceding the nominal form expressing the
possessor (see description of noun phrases in 8.2.1):
88a. *nhi-nhipoko-re2 nota

Although it is true that, as was shown earlier in the previous chapter (see 4.1),
certain nouns have their own subcategorization frame (for example, inalienable nouns
subcategorize for taking a possessor), the subcategorization distinction involving nouns
and verbs, however, still obtains, since what this subset of nouns subcategorizes for are
not the same things verbs subcategorize for. Other syntactic properties that can
distinguish verbs from nouns include formal and behavioral reflexes of valence changing
operations, but these are presented along with the description of simple clauses in the
341next chapter. Finally, so far I have not attested any clear instance of labile verbs in the
language.","[369, 370, 371, 372, 373]"

‘He killed you (pl).’The same pronominal markers are used for the subject regardless of the
transitivity of the verb (as shown in chapter 5, under 5.1.1), semantic or pragmatic roles
of the subject NP. What would appear to constitute an exception are the objective
descriptive intransitive verbs, described in the chapter 5, in 5.1.1.1.2.2. If it could be
shown that these verbs have different semantic properties from standard intransitive
verbs, one could argue that pronominal subject markers are co-referential with arguments
other than the single argument of verbs with the semantics of object descriptive verbs and
other than the “patient”-like argument of transitive verbs. However, as was shown in the
previous chapter (in subsection 5.1.1.1.2.2), although the class of descriptive verbs shows
some semantic correlates, it cannot be reduced to a specifiable semantic class of verbs
and, as such, can be more generally characterized as a grammatically (as opposed to
semantically) motivated subclass of intransitive verbs, although one that strongly
correlates with property-referring concepts. That is, the fact that object descriptive verbs
475take object rather than subject as their single argument cannot be motivated on purely
semantic grounds, thus constituting no exception to the claim that the pronominal subject
markers are co-referential with grammatical rather than semantic relations, namely with
the grammatical subject. As a consequence, subject pronominal markers are a reliable
criterion that can be used for the identification of grammatical subjects in Apurinã,
although not all grammatical subjects in other languages will translate as grammatical
subjects in Apurinã.
8.3.1.2Object
The pronominal marking system can be used to distinguish the object from thesubject. As seen in various examples of previous chapters (e.g. 7.1.1, 7.1.12, and in
Tables 6-7 in section 7.3), the pronominal marking system includes a set of (bound)
object markers that is distinct from the set of (bound) subject pronominal markers. This
object pronominal marking is further illustrated in (50), where, e.g. in (50a), the
pronominal form that is suffixed to the verb, i.e. –i, is co-referential with the post-verbal
independent pronoun for second person singular, pite, expressing the undergoer argument
of the verb. The other examples below illustrate the same for the other grammatical
persons of the object paradigm (where underlining marks coreference):

As was shown in (47), the subject can also be an undergoer argument of a verb,
which by itself already suggests that a core grammatical relation encoding an undergoer
argument is not an exclusive property of the object, and, by extension, that grammatical
relations cannot be equated with semantic roles. This is confirmed by the examples in
(50) where verbs expressing from the least to the most “patient”-like meanings all take
the object marking paradigm coreferential with the independent pronominal forms.
Furthermore, to the extent that the single argument of (intransitive) descriptive verbs can
be accompanied by a coreferential object (rather than subject) markers (as was shown, for
example, in chapter 5, in 5.1.1.1.2.2) justifies treating the syntactic expression of such
arguments as bearing object (rather than subject) grammatical relation. So, the single
arguments of each of the simplex sentences illustrated in (51) (repeated from 12 in
4775.1.1.1.2.2) are all coreferential with object pronominal markers in the verb and, as such
bear object relation in these sentences:

be.black-3M.O clothes-UNPOSS
‘The clothes are black.’
d. mita-ru
aiko
be.big-3M.O house
‘The house is big.’
Also, as was briefly mentioned in chapter 7 (7.1.1.2.2), the (bound) object
pronominal markers can sometimes be coreferential with the undergoer and sometimes
with the goal argument of verbs that can optionally take a third argument (where “goal”
also functions as a macrorole semantically in that it includes “recipient” and “goal”
semantic roles, and which is properly described in 9.1.2.4). This is precisely what is
demonstrated in (52) (as highlighted by underlining). In (52a), the third person feminine
object pronominal marker -ru is coreferential with the goal NPobl, uwa-mokaru ‘to him’,
whereas in (52b), the third person feminine object pronominal marker is coreferential
with the undergoer NP, nu-serepi ‘my arrow’:
s-V-o.goal UNDERGOER GOAL
52a. o-suka-ru

b. nota suka-ro
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
1SG give-3F.O
3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘I gave the arrow to him.’
The fact that either a NPobl or a NP can be coded in the verb through the
coreferential object pronominal marker (i.e., -ro (52)) indicates that the object of a
(potentially) ditransitive verb can be expressed either as a NP or as a NPobl. Moreover,
the only non-subject argument whose (morpho)syntactic expression is obligatory in a
clause with a ditransitive verb is the goal argument. So, in a clause such as (53a) the only
obligatory non-subject argument is suto ‘woman’, rather than kinharu ‘“buriti” fruit’:10
UNDERGOER s-V-o.goal GOAL
53a. kinharu
u-suka-ro
suto
buriti
3F-give-3F.O woman(F)
‘He gave the woman “buriti” fruit.’
s-V-o.goal GOAL
b. u-suka-ro
suto
3F-give-3F.O woman(F)
‘He gave (it) to the woman.’
Since the object has been defined over the object pronominal markers, it follows
that NPobl that are coreferential with an object pronominal marker bear an object
relationship with the verb. However, object has also been classified above as a core
grammatical relation, that is, one that is required by the lexical meaning of the verb and,
as a result, obligatorily expressed (morpho)syntactically in a clause having such a verb.
Hence, since the only non-subject argument required in a clause with a ditransitive verb
is the goal argument, it would be logical to conclude that only the (morpho)syntactic10I have found more recently that this is not true of all dialects, since in some of them the example in (53b) is479expression of the goal argument should be considered the object of clauses with
ditransitive verbs. So, in an example such as (52b), where it is the undergoer NP
nu-serepi ‘my arrow.of’ that is coreferential with the pronominal marker in the verb (not
the goal NPobl uwa-mokaru ‘to him’), the question arises as to which element is the object
of the verb, the goal NPobl or the undergoer NP. I will maintain that the element that is
coreferential with the pronominal marker in the verb is the object in the cause, thus
postulating that object pronominal marking is the primary definitional property of
grammatical objects. That is, in (52b), uwa-mokaru is the object in the clause. This
question, however, about which element is the object of the verb only appears to arise in
elicited data, as there is no instance of natural spontaneous data where the undergoer
argument is expressed as a free syntactic expression that is coreferential with a
pronominal object marker in the verb. In natural texts, only the goal arguments co-occur
with such a pronominal marker. Instances of both goal and undergoer arguments cooccurring pre-verbally (thus, with no accompanying coreferential marker) is even less
natural and, perhaps, an artifact of the method by which the data are collected, i.e.
through elicitation.
On the face of the fact the syntactic expression of the goal argument can behave
(for the purpose of coreference with the object marker in the verb) similarly to the
syntactic expression of the undergoer argument in some clauses, but differently in others,
one may be led to describe the former situations (i.e. goal behaving the same way as
undergoer) as constituting instances of promotions of non-objects into objects. Although
such an analysis has been suggested for other languages in the past (e.g., Givón’sambiguous, being interpretable as ‘He gave the woman (to somebody)’ or ‘He gave something to the woman.’4801994:233-234 analysis of a piece of data from Machiguenga, another Maipuran
language), it would appear to be equally plausible to describe the marking syncretism
attested for goal and undergoer marking in Apurinã as simply following from what
defines object in Apurinã. In this case, the different ways in which objects are marked in
languages like Apurinã would follow from the same principles that motivate the different
mappings between semantic roles and the grammatical subject in various languages (see
Dryer 1986). In sum, the object in a potentially ditransitive clause in this language will
be the free expression of the non-subject argument that is coreferential with the object
marker in the verb; the third non-subject argument in the clause will be described as an
oblique, regardless of whether it is an undergoer or recipient.
8.3.1.3Remarks on Subject/Object and the Co-referential Pronominal MarkingPatterns
The coreferential marking patterns associated with the subject and object
pronominal markers and the arguments of the verb can be described as involving a type
of Split-S Intransitivity, where the single argument of descriptive (intransitive) verbs is
marked in the same way as the object of transitive verbs, and differently from the single
argument of (standard) intransitive verbs. Following the notation used by Dryer (To
Appear), the grouping of arguments into what is the grammatical subject in Apurinã can
be represented as follows: (Where ‘S’ = the single argument of an intransitive verb, ‘A’ =
more “agent”-like argument of a transitive verb, and ‘P’ = more “patient”-like argument)48154.","[505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513]"
"104generalizations represented earlier as rules (94) and (96). The rule in (94) accounted for
the assignment of the primary stress, while the rule in (96) accounted for the assignment
of the secondary stress. Moreover, the assignment of stresses when bound forms are
added to a word base only confirms, first, the culminative penultimate stress pattern (i.e.
that primary stress occurs predominantly as penultimate), and, second, that the secondary
stress falls on even syllables to the left of the primary stress. The only systematic
exceptions to the generalization that penultimate stress is maintained during the addition
of bound forms to the word consist of the words with final heavy (bi-moraic) syllables, in
which case the primary stress attraction to heavy syllables overrides the general rule
assigning the primary stress to the penultimate syllable. This can be seen if we contrast
(108a) to (108b), and (108c) to (108d). Such examples follow from the rule given in
(104):

structure that the information presented so far leads to. As I anticipated earlier, a detailed
analysis of prosody in Apurinã is still part of an on-going investigation and, thus, cannot
yet be conclusively described in this work. Nevertheless, the data provided so far are
very suggestive as to the kind of organization of prosodic words the language has. The
xx[σσ] stress pattern (where σ represents any syllable taking primary or secondary stress)
that arises from the culminative penultimate stress plus the rule assigning secondary
105stress to even syllables to the left of the primary stress can be used to motivate a syllabic
trochaic foot structure. A foot is defined as the minimal bracketed constituent of a
prosodic word (Hayes 1995:40-41). A “syllabic trochaic foot” (or syllable trochee) is a
“disyllabic [foot] (...) with prominence on the initial syllable” (Hayes 1995:63). So, the
prosodic word for ‘with our relatives’ can be represented (partly following the Hayesian
representational system (1995:39)) as in (109), where “x” marks stressed while “.” marks
unstressed syllables: (The intermediary structure between syllabic and moraic domains
are ignored in the representation below.)

word initial (.) would be interpretable as the so-called degenerate foot, i.e. a foot
consisting of a single syllable (Hayes 1995:86). This analysis, however, is still rather
preliminary and its consequences for the overall description of the language prosody are
still under investigation. In fact, as was made clear above, a detailed picture of the
Apurinã prosodic system still requires further investigation. One of the problems with
the syllabic trochaic analysis is that it does not account for the prosodic structure that
arises when words with an ultimate heavy syllable are considered. Words with an
xultimate heavy syllable have an iambic (rather than moraic) structure, i.e. [σσ]. Another
reason to only sketch here the analysis of the language prosodic structure follows from
the problems summarized next.

"6.7.5 Hortative Particle
The hortative particle can be realized as (h)amo or am-, depending on a combination of
speech variety in the first case, or on rate of speech, in the second case. As the label suggests,
hortative is used to incite or invite someone to do something, as shown by the examples in (37).
I will say more on hortative marking in chapter 8, in 8.8.3.1, when presenting the clause it occurs
within as speech act.

3746.8 Final Remarks
As is clear from the list of words belonging to the closed classes presented in this chapter,
only a limited set of grammatical functions can be expressed in Apurinã by means of such
independent words. This follows as a natural consequence of the wide range of grammatical
functions expressed by bound formatives in the language, as the ones described in chapters 3-5
and the ones that will be described in the next chapter. Moreover, although closed word classes
such as independent pronouns, in general, possess no inherent morphological properties formally
marked (i.e., with very few exceptions such as the 3rd person plural marker -na, they are not
generally segmentable into class-specific morphemes in the same way as nouns and verbs are).
Finally, I will return to some of the closed classes or words in chapters 8-9, where the syntax of
simplex sentences is described. As happens in various other places in this work, certain word
properties can be better described within the specific domains of the grammar that these
properties are most relevant to. This applies most clearly to the interrogative words and to the
majority of the particles introduced above. In fact, even more than syntactic structures, discourse
particles require information about the organization of the Apurinã discourse structure in order to
be properly described. Since this work does not include a description of discourse structures,
discourse particles cannot (unfortunately) be satisfactorily described here.","[405, 406]"
"279intransitive verbs take subject pronominal markers. An arguable difference would consist
of the fact that while the standard intransitive verbs can take the same morphological
forms as the transitive verbs (described in 5.1.1.2) —as long as such forms are
grammatically compatible with intransitivity— subjective descriptive verbs do not easily
allow these morphological forms. I use the expression “do not easily allow” because
there is a degree of variation across speakers as to which morphological forms can go
with subjective intransitive verbs. So, while the examples of standard intransitives in
(10) are perfectly grammatical, those of subjective intransitives in (11) vary from
somewhat acceptable to ungrammatical for different Apurinã speakers: (The
morphological forms used in these examples, except for the pronominal markers, will be
described in detail in 5.2)

3M-be.tired-RANDOM-VBLZ‘He’s aimlessly tired.’It is the somewhat distinct behavior of subjective intransitive verbs in terms of the
verb morphology they take that has led me to separate them morphologically from
280standard intransitive verbs. As a result of the speakers’ variations in evaluating the
grammaticality of these examples, I have not reached any systematic results as to the
complete set of morphological forms that can or cannot go with subjective intransitive
verbs. At the present time I can only say that it is most likely that both semantic as well
as grammatical factors play a role in determining the difference between standard
intransitive and subjective intransitive verbs, and that a more detailed work specifically
on the class of subjective intransitive verbs is required in order to tease apart semantic
from grammatical (in)compatibility with standard/subject descriptive verbs. One of the
problems in accounting for the examples such as those in (11) is to tease apart cases that
are ungrammatical simply because they are semantically anomalous from others where
syntactic factors determine their (un)grammaticality.
5.1.1.1.2.2Objective Descriptive Intransitive VerbsObjective descriptive verbs are the monovalent property-referring verbs whose
only (lexically) required syntactic argument (when a free post-verbal (pro)nominal
expression) can (optionally) co-occur with an object pronominal marker attached to the
verb, but where such pronominal markers are used to express the notional subject rather
than the notional object of the verb. In the following examples the verbs hareka ‘be
good’, here ‘be pretty’ and pooma ‘be hot’ all take the object pronominal marker for first
person singular:

‘I am good.’
b. here-no
be.pretty-1SG.O
‘I am pretty.’

"2544.4.10 Distribution of Affixes and Generalized Noun Stem Formation
Rules
The purpose of this subsection is to present the generalizations in terms of which
the structures involved in noun stem formation can be described. Before presenting the
general rules for forming noun stems, some labels need to be introduced in order to
facilitate some contrasts to be noted in the noun structure. In the noun stem formation
rules described in the previous subsections we have seen that certain noun stems can
consist of a single root with no further morphological marking. Such is the case of some
simple alienable nouns such as kanawa ‘canoe of’, which follows the word formation rule
(hereafter WFR) NSt → RtALIEN (+te), which states that noun stems can consist of an
alienable root plus the possessed marker -te. This is also the case of inalienable noun
stems such as kuwu ‘head of’, which follows the WFR NSt → RtINAL (+ txi), which states
that noun stems can consist of an inalienable root (i.e. belonging to the class of
inalienable roots) plus the inalienable marker -txi. In both cases the root forms can stand
by themselves as a noun, and they will be hereafter referred to as free roots (abbreviated
to FRt). Hence, both WFRs will be rewritten as NStALIEN → FRtALIEN.te (+te) and
NStINAL → FRtINAL (+ txi), respectively.
In contrast to FRts, there are bound roots such as kota- ‘basket’, a mixed
(un)possessed root form following the WFR NSt → RtMIX + {re2, ru2}, which states that
some noun stems can consist of a mixed (un)possessed root (i.e. belonging to the class of
roots that select -re2) plus the possessed marker -re2 or the unpossessed marker -ru2. As
represented in this WFR, root forms such as kota- cannot stand by themselves as nouns,
and hence will be hereafter referred to as bound roots (abbreviated to BRt). Hence, the
255WFR for alienable nouns stem with bound roots can be rewritten as
NSt → BRtALIEN + [re2, ru2]. This terminological distinction is motivated both by
expository reasons and by the fact that, as we will see, certain affix forms are sensitive to
such a distinction.
In view of the introduction of the FRt versus BRt2 distinction, the WFRs for noun
stems need to be partly revised as follows: (Although an analogous BRt versus FRt
oposition can be made for verbal roots, such a distinction will be ignored here, as it will
be described later in chapter 5, under 5.1.)
Inalienable non-classificatory nouns have free roots, i.e.:
107. NStINAL.NON-CL → FRtINAL-NON-CL (+ txi)
Inalienable classificatory nouns have free roots, i.e.:
108. NStINAL.CL → BRt.INAL.CL (+ txi)
All alienable noun stems have either a free noun root or, in the case of some of
those marked by -re1, a verb base, as represented by the WFR in (109):

roots, i.e.:
111. NSt → FRt + FRt
Productive noun compounds (also in the cases attested so far) have free roots, i.e.:
112. NSt → FRt + CN (+ CN)
All noun stems morphologically marked for gender have a bound root where the
masculine, i.e. -ru, and the feminine, i.e. -ro, gender markers can occur, as represented in
(113):
ru
113. NSt → BRt + ro


V + muna
ru
114. NSt → 
FRt + muna + ro

 
These revised WFRs are restricted to those that are clearly grammaticalized in the
language, and they incorporate the bound versus free root distinction. Other WFRs such
as the ones for augmentative/diminutive have no need to be revised because they are not257(yet) part of the grammatical system of noun stem formation. Augmentative/diminutive
functions in the language are expressed as extensions of the meaning of morphemes with
other grammatical functions.
The processes of WFRs above can then be summarized as involving (i) “null”
affixation (e.g. possessed inalienable nouns), (ii) the addition of a second nominal stem to
the right of a noun root (to form a compound noun), (iii) the addition of a classificatory
noun to the right of a noun stem or noun root (to form a productive compound), and,
finally, (iv) by the suffixation of category changing bound formatives to a verbal or
nominal base (e.g. actor nominalization). At a more generalized level, the WFRs for
nouns are thus as follows:
First, a noun stem can simply be a free noun root; second, a noun stem can consist of a
compound noun base formed by a free noun root plus a second free noun root, plus
(optionally) one or more classificatory nouns; or a noun stem can consist of a free noun
root plus a noun stem marker (where a noun stem marker (NStM) is any of the noun stem
forming suffixes described in the previous subsection); or, yet, a noun stem can consist of
either a bound root or a verb form plus a noun stem marker, i.e.:

V +NStM
 or yet as to whether the root base is bound or free.
The terms “root” and “stem” are probably among the most traditional words
found in the morphological literature. Implicitly or explicitly, “root’ is traditionally used
to name the minimal lexical base (where “base” is a any morphological unit to which
other morphological forms attach) which category changing bound morphemes can attach
258to; whereas “stem” is generally used to name the morphological base which
(sub)category maintaining bound morphemes/processes attach to/occur (Anderson
1985a:6, 1992:71, Spencer 1991:5). The use and definition of these terms follow from
the general tendency for (sub)category maintaining bound morphemes/processes to occur
outside (sub)category changing bound morphemes/processes, and vice-versa; or, in other
words, their use follows from the tendency for (sub)category changing morphemes to
occur closer to the root, and for the (sub)category maintaining morphemes to occur
farther from the root. In this description of Apurinã, a “noun stem” is any noun base
internally consisting only of noun stem morphology, or, in other words, any base on the
margins of which non-noun stem morphology (described in the next section) can occur.
Parallel to Anderson’s (1992) definition of the term, noun stem is a noun minus the
non-noun stem morphology. It is this non-noun stem morphology that is presented next.
Now that we have seen the ways that a noun stem can be formed, we can go on to
describe the other nominal forms that can only occur once the noun stem has already
been formed. In other words, now that the structure of noun stems has been described,
the morphological forms that can only attach to stems can be presented.","[285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290]"
"Perfectivity Marking: -pe, -panhi
There are two perfectivity markers that can attach to noun bases, pronoun basesor verb bases, namely the perfective and imperfective aspectual markers. One can argue
that aspectual markers should NOT be considered as part of the noun or pronoun
morphology, since the scope of such a marker is the event/state rather than the referent of394the noun or pronoun in question. Or, conversely, one can argue that word bases taking
perfectivity markers are not noun or pronoun forms since they take marking forms
associated with the event/state expressed in the verb. Although, in a general sense, both
arguments could be correct in other languages (or in Apurinã under a different view of
the domain of morphology), the fact is that the word forms described below as taking
aspectual markers fit the definition of grammatical words given in chapter 3, regardless
of their translation into English. In other words, there is no reason to think that
perfectivity markers make a noun or a pronoun into a verb. In the following subsection, I
will merely illustrate some examples of noun, pronoun and verb bases marked with
perfectivity markers. I will return to the discussion of perfectivity markers in chapter 8,
in 8.6.2, where I will provide a more detailed description of the semantics of perfectivity
markers. In translating clauses marked with perfectivity markers, I will use the English
perfective form have V-ed to translate the perfective marking, and the English form
still/yet to translate the imperfective marking. Although this does not constitute a
“perfect” translation of the perfectivity markers, it covers some of their most typical
meanings —which will be described in detail in chapter 8.6.2.

"5779.1.1.1.7“Inverse” Relative ClausesAside from the relative pronominal markers described above and the types of
ClRELs they mark, there is one last subset left. This subset was given in the last column in
Table 1 above, and it consists of -keru and -kero. The form ??-keno, also given in Table
1, is a putative form that can be arrived at by internal reconstruction, that has not been
attested in the language and, as such, that may never have existed at all. In the present
analysis only the attested singular forms (i.e. -keru and -kero) are described. The basic
facts about these markers may sound complex at first and can be best described in two
parts: First, in purely distributional terms, -keru and -kero occur attached to transitive
verbs in ClRELs containing an overt (phonologically) free argument expression that refers
to first or second person singular, or an argument encoded as a pronominal marker; and,
second, in functional terms, -keru and -kero invert the semantic roles of subject and
object when the former is encoded as first or second person singular or as a bound
pronominal marker. These descriptive facts are observable in the following examples.
First, take the simplex sentences in (24), where the subjects of both sentences are
coreferential:
O
s-V
24a. kuku n-/pu-/a-/h-atama-ta
man 1SG/3M/2SG/1PL/2PL-see-VBLZ
‘I/you(SG)/we/you(PL) saw the man.’
s-V
b. kuku apo-pe
man arrive-PFTV
‘The man has arrived.’578If the two sentences above are combined to form a complex sentence where (24a) is
embedded in (24b) as a ClREL marked with -keru, the result is the complex sentence in
(25):
S/ACTOR [undergoer-V-rel.inv

V
25. kuku
n-/pu-/a-/h-atama-ta-keru
apo-pe
man
1SG/2SG/1PL/2PL-see-REL.M.INV arrive-PFTV
‘The man who saw me/him/you/us/you(PL) has arrived.’
In (25) kuku is the headREL, n-/pu-/a-/h-atamatakeru ‘who saw
me/you/us/you(PL)’ is the ClREL, and apo-pe ‘has arrived’ is the verb of the matrix
clause. Note that there is NOT an error in the gloss, the bound subject pronominal forms
n-/pu-/a-/h- that encoded the actor semantic role in the simplex sentence in (24a) indeed
now encode the undergoer semantic role in the ClREL in (25); and the form kuku that
encoded an undergoer semantic role in (24b) now encodes the actor semantic role of the
ClREL in (25). Hence, my use of “S/ACTOR” (i.e. subject of the matrix clause/actor in
the ClREL) on top of kuku and of “s-“ (i.e. bound subject marker) on top of n-/pu-/a-/h- in
(25) reflects the syntactic roles that would be associated with these forms if there was not
an “inverse” ClREL pronominal marker. This inversion of the semantic roles of subject
and object (from actor to undergoer and vice-versa) is the most interesting aspect of these
relative pronominal markers, and is what has led me to refer to the type of ClRELs marked
with -keru/-kero as “inverse” ClRELs —the quotation marks being justified in the
following paragraphs.
Take now the simplex sentences in (26-27), which can be combined into complex
sentences such as those in (28):579O

The purpose of the examples in (28) is twofold. First, the example in (28a) shows
that the “inverse” relative pronominal markers can also be used when the argument of the
ClREL is expressed as independent pronouns for first or second person singular. So, in
(28a) kuku is the headREL, nota/pita karota-kero ‘who saw me/you’ is the ClREL, and
apo-pe the verb of the matrix clause. And, second, the examples in (28) also demonstrate
the gender distinction, also marked in “inverse” relative pronominal markers. In (28b)
suto is the feminine headREL, p-atama-ta-kero ‘who saw you’ is the ClREL taking the
580relative marker (-kero) inflected for the feminine gender to agree with the headREL suto,
and kona apoka ‘not arrive’ is the predicate of the matrix clause:
The examples in (29) are analogous to the ones above, except that the headREL
both in (29a) and in (29b) is object in the matrix clause, whereas in the previous
examples given in this section the headREL is subject in the matrix clause. The data in
(29) are given (for the sake of completeness) to demonstrate that, as is the case with the
other pronominal relative markers described in previous sections, the role of the headREL
in the matrix clause is irrelevant for the marking of “inverse” ClRELs.

The final examples of this subsection are given in (30), and they demonstrate one
of the properties mentioned above for “inverse” ClRELs: These clauses are restricted to
the ones where the overt argument is expressed by a pronominal marker or by first or
second person independent pronouns. Hence, the example in (30a) is ungrammatical
because the undergoer argument of the ClREL is a third person singular independent
nominal expression; and the one in (30b) is ungrammatical because the undergoer of the
ClREL is neither first nor second person singular:

There are two ways in that “inverse” ClRELs may be seen (under one specific
view) as reminiscent to inverse systems such as the one of North American Algonquian
languages (Foley and Van Valin 1985:296-399 and references there cited). The first is
that affixes otherwise associated with actors are associated instead with undergoers. The
second is that part of the constraints on the use of the “inverse” relative pronominal
marker is that the inverse is required when the actor is third person and the undergoer is
first or second person, partially following a person hierarchy. While the first way in
which a comparison can be made between “inverse” ClRELs and inverse systems is clear,
the second way put forth here is not so straightforward, thus requiring some further
justification below.
The “inverse” ClRELs constitute a type of restrictive clause. The semantics and
pragmatics of first and second person pronouns are such that, in most usual
circumstances, they are incompatible with those inherent to a headREL modified by a
restrictive ClREL. Since the most common function of a restrictive relative clause is to
specify, identify, restrict, etc., the meaning of the headREL, it cannot in principle modify
first or second person. It follows then that the headREL modified by a restrictive ClREL
refers, by definition, to third person, not first or second. Therefore, it follows that the
constraint on the kinds of independent pronouns that can function as undergoer of
“inverse” ClRELs plus the semantics and pragmatics inherent to restrictive ClRELs and
(exclusively) to first and second persons singular will produce only “inverse” ClRELs with
582independent subjects where 3>1,2 (i.e. third person acts on first and second persons
singular). However, at the same time that this analysis of the data can be used to justify
an analogy between “inverse” ClRELs and inverse systems in other languages, it can also
be used to understand the properties of “inverse” ClRELs as a development which is
independent and (perhaps) unrelated to true inverse systems.
An explanation, however, is still needed for why pronominal forms are among the
elements that can be the overt argument of “inverse” ClREL, and for why constraints that
apply to independent pronouns referring to first and second persons singular do not apply
to those referring to first and second persons plural. Of all the types of restrictive ClRELs
found in Apurinã, “inverse” ClRELs are the ones that require further investigation the
most. The data presented here are mostly based on the speech of one speaker and,
although, the speaker was very consistent in producing data with the same cluster of
properties given above, further verification needs to be done with more speakers, even if
only to confirm that the speech of more speakers shares such properties. It is possible,
for example, that what is described here as “inverse” ClRELs is actually the residue of
another subsystem of relativization that is pretty much out of use in the language
nowadays.
9.1.1.2Headless Relative Clauses
In all types of relative clauses described above there is a headREL that is modifiedby the ClREL. The purpose of this subsection is to show that ClRELs can also be headless,
that is, they can occur with no headREL. The pair of examples in (31) illustrates headless
ClRELs marked, respectively, with the subject and the object relative pronominal markers.
In (31a) the headless ClREL is suto oka-karu ‘who/what killed the woman’, and the
583subject is encoded solely by the subject relative pronominal marker -karu. In (31b) the
headless ClREL is a-nhika-kutu ‘what we eat’, and the object is encoded solely by the
object relative pronominal marker -kutu:
s-V-o
[O
V-rel.s ]ClREL

b. a-nhika-kutu
hareka-putu-ru
1PL-eat-REL.M.O be.good-EMPH-3M.O
‘What we eat is very good.’
The example in (32) is illustrative of a headless ClREL where the negative form of
the subject relative pronominal marker is used. The headless ClREL is ma-ãreka-kat-inhi
‘the one who is not bad’, and the subject is encoded solely by the negative relative
subject pronominal marker -katu:
[neg-V-rel.neg.s ]ClREL
V
32. ma-ãreka-kati-nhi
upũpe
PRIV-be.good-REL.M.S-AFFECT die
‘The one who was bad died.’
In (33) the headless ClREL is n-atama-kero ‘the one who saw me’, and it is marked with
the inverse relative pronominal marker -keru:

33. p-apoka-ru
n-atama-ta-keru
2SG-find-3M.O 1SG-see-REL.M.S
‘You found the one who looked at me.’
In (34) the headless ClREL is nhipoko-ta-koru ‘the devoured one’, marked with the passive
relative pronominal marker -koru:
584[ V-rel.pass ]ClREL
34. nhipoko-ta-koru ...
eat-VBLZ-REL.F.PASS
‘What was devoured...’
Lit.: ‘The devoured one...’9.1.1.3Relative Clauses with Non-Verbal Predicators
In 8.4 two general types of clauses were identified in the language, verbal andnon-verbal. For all ClRELs described above the clauses are verbal rather than non-verbal.
This subsection describes ClRELs with non-verbal predicators. Simplex sentences
constituted of non-verbal predicators may consist of the juxtaposition of word forms, and
they can only encode states (as seen in 8.4.2). A non-verbal clause can occur inside a
complex sentence where one NP (from the non-verbal clause) is interpreted as the
headREL that is modified by another NP (also from the non-verbal clause) functioning as a
ClREL. So, in (35a), the nominal form popũka-ro ‘Apurinã-F’ works as a nominal
predicator modifying suto ‘woman’, and in (35b) suto-nhi ‘woman-AFFECT’ works as
the nominal predicator that modifies amarunu ‘child’: 3

boundaries are nowadays opaque in some speech varieties, and the word is used to mean as a hybrid now to mean
‘child’, interpretable as masculine or feminine.","[608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616]"
"4.4.2 Possessed Markers: -te, -ne, -re1, and -re2
The possessed markers -te, -ne, and -re1 were described above in 4.1.2 as suffixes
that occur with alienable simple nouns, whereas the possessed marker -re2 was described
in 4.1.3 as a suffix that occurs with mixed simple nouns. Under the analysis presented
earlier, the choice of possessed markers is lexically determined. In the absence of further
specification, there are two possible interpretations of what it means here for possessed
markers to be lexically determined: It will either mean that (i) possessed markers are
assigned as part of the morphological properties associated with noun stems, or that (ii)
possessed markers are assigned in the lexicon (or at a different level in the lexicon, if
morphology is conceived inside the lexicon —depending on one’s morphological theory)
so that the information determining which possessed marker a noun base will take will be
part of the lexical meaning of the noun base (and not a result of any general grammatical
rule). In terms of the traditional derivational versus inflectional opposition made for
affixes in the morphological typology, possession marking is generally treated as an
inflectional category. In any analysis of -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2, these formatives will be
more inflectional or derivational-like depending on how one analyzes their morphological
status. In the next paragraphs I will describe these two possible analyses for possessed
228markers, and then will suggest a third analysis which will turn out to be a combination of
the first two.
In the first analysis possessed marking would be implemented as morphological
rules, and the formatives -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2 would be described as partially suppletive
allomorphs. If these possessed markers are analyzed as (partially suppletive) allomorphs
of the same morpheme, then they will be more like inflectional categories in other
languages, since they would simply constitute the allomorphic realization
(i.e. -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2, as determined by the morphological class of the noun they occur
with) of the morpheme {possessed}. In this first analysis speakers/hearers are assumed
to have a notion of the more abstract morpheme {possessed}, and the work of
implementing the phonological realization of {possessed} is left for the suppletive rules.
The rules in (70) represent the implementation of this first analysis:
70a. NSt → Rt + {possessed}
te
Rt

Rtne
b. Rt → Rt 
re1
Rtre2-te

-ne
c. {possessed} → -re 
1
-re2
(70a) states that a possessed noun stem is formed of a root plus the morpheme
{possessed}. (70b) specifies that the root base to which the morpheme {possessed}
attaches belongs to one of a set of four roots (i.e. Rtte, Rtne, Rtre1, or Rtre2) —which are
lexically marked to select one of the four partially suppletive forms of the morpheme229{possessed}. Finally, (70c) further specifies that the morpheme {possessed} can be
realized as -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2 —depending on the class of the root base (i.e. Rtte, Rtne,
Rtre1, or Rtre2) such a morpheme attaches to.
The first analysis just outlined is the descriptively least troublesome analysis to
the linguist because it makes use of suppletion to explain the various forms which
possessed marking takes, therefore exempting the analyst from providing unique meaning
or function to each of the suppletive forms. Such would be the case for the following
reason: In arguing that whether the {possessed} morpheme takes the form -te, -ne, -re1
or -re2 would be purely a matter of which morphological (arbitrary) class the base taking
this {possessed} morpheme belongs to we would also be giving up any possibility of
finding a semantic, phonological or syntactic motivation for the various possessed
markers in the language. Moreover, the fact that -te, -ne, -re1 and -re2 can all be
characterized as denoting one general meaning, namely ‘possessed’, is supportive of an
allomorphic analysis under partial suppletion. Notice, however, that the result of a
suppletive analysis of possessed markers in Apurinã would differ from, for example, a
suppletive analysis of go > went, be > am, is, are etc. in English. In go > went the
suppletion is grammatically motivated, since speakers/hearers only need to associate the
“irregular” forms with the past tense. In be > am, is, are etc., suppletion is also
grammatically motivated because speakers/hearers need to associate “irregular” forms
with the tense, person and number. In Apurinã, however, suppletive forms such as -te
> -ne > -re1 > -re2 would each need to be associated with an arbitrarily defined subset of
roots.
In the second analysis of possessed marking, possessed markers would be
conceived as satisfying the subcategorization constraints of subsets of roots in the same
230way as the gender (or noun class) markers do in languages where gender is lexically
(rather than semantically or phonologically) assigned. Some roots in Apurinã would
have the possessed markers assigned to them in a way similar to how masculine/feminine
gender is assigned to noun stems that take no overt gender marker in the language —as
described in the previous subsection. That is, under this analysis, the root form ããta
‘canoe(F)’ would subcategorize both to agree with the feminine gender (as in o-ye ããta
[F-PROX canoe] ‘this canoe’) and to take the -ne possessed marker (as in nota ããta-ne
[1SG canoe-POSSED] ‘my canoe’). An informal description of the meaning of the noun
root ããta could be represented as in (71):
 'canoe' 
71. ããta ‘FEMININE’
-ne


In this second analysis, each of the possessed markers would be analyzed as
independent morphemes whose information is recorded as part of the lexical entry of the
root they attach to. Each of the four possessed markers, by definition, would have
distinctive meaning and/or functional properties, if they are to be treated as morphemes.
Moreover, if the possessed markers -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2 are analyzed as different
morphemes that certain roots subcategorize for, then they will be more like derivational
morphological categories in other languages. This would be true to the extent that the
information about the morphological markers would, conceivably, be stored as part of the
lexical entry of the roots they occur with. In sum, in this second analysis,
speakers/hearers are assumed to subcategorize roots for taking -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2; the
information about the morphological realization of each of the possessed markers is built
as part of the lexical entry of certain lexically specified roots, and the work left to do is to
231provide meaning and/or function to each of the possessed markers as separate
morphemes. (72) presents the rule stating that the possessed noun stems are realized as a
subset of roots plus the possessed morphemes such roots are lexically specified to take:
te + te
Rt

Rtne + ne
72. NSt → Rt + re 
re1
1
Rtre2 + re2The major problem with the second analysis is in motivating an independent
morphemic status for each of the possessed markers -te, -ne, -re1 and -re2. In an earlier
attempt to make sense out of the use of these possessed markers in less arbitrary ways
(see Facundes 1995) I found that very intricate arguments can be explored in constructing
an account for possessed marking. Such arguments are partially grounded on information
of how genitive classifiers are used in other languages (as described in Carlson and
Payne 1989), on cross-linguistic properties of (in)alienability (as presented in Nichols
1988), on the notion of predicativity as it extends to nominal possession (as suggested in
Seiler 1983), and on iconicity principles as expressed in a notion of conceptual distance
(as presented in Chappell and McGregor 1989). The basic idea is that if possession
marking is conceived as a formal device used in some languages to express a
combination of conceptual distance between possessor and possessee, the functional or
social role of the possessee for the possessor, and degrees of predicativity between the
possessor and the possessee (as analogous to an argument and its verb), it may be
possible to assign some meaning to each of the possessed markers in Apurinã, perhaps
enough to consider them as distinct morphemes that are related in terms of having one
general meaning, i.e. possessed, but also different in terms of the type of possession they
232encode. In this manner, possessed markers would work in ways analogous to, for
example, the various morphemes for object that also inflect for person, since such
morphemes would have the general common property of marking object and, at the same
time, they would also have different properties in that they would also refer each to a
different person. So far, however, I have not been able to provide satisfactory
independent meaning/function for each of the possessed markers in order to motivate
their morphemic status.
The third analysis to be suggested here can be summarized as follows: First, the
possessed markers, in addition to carrying the meaning ‘possessed’, also function as the
morphological forms performing the marking patterns that motivate the notions of simple
alienable nouns and of simple mixed nouns (described in 4.1.2 and 4.1.3, respectively);
second, while the possessed markers -te, -ne, and -re1 are partial suppletive allomorphs of
a single morpheme whose meaning/function is ‘[possessed, alienable]’, the possessed
marker -re2 is a morpheme (different from -te, -ne, and -re1) whose meaning/function is
‘[possessed, mixed]’; and, third, ‘possessed’ refers to the property of being possessed,
‘alienable’ refers to the property of belonging to the (un)possession marking pattern
associated with simple alienable nouns (as described in 4.1.2), and ‘mixed’ refers to the
property of belonging to the (un)possession marking pattern associated with simple
mixed nouns (as described in 4.1.3). The examples in (73) illustrate the general meaning
properties of the root forms ããta and kota-, as they can be described following an
analysis in which the (un)possession marking patterns are generalized to become the
defining properties of alienable and mixed nouns, and constructed as part of the meaning
of these root forms:233 'canoe' 
73a. ããta ‘ FEMININE ’
ALIENABLE
 'basket' 
b. kota ‘MASCULINE’
 MIXED 
In (73a), ‘canoe’ is the content meaning of the root form ããta, whereas
‘FEMININE’ and ‘ALIENABLE’ are the grammatical meanings which this root
subcategorizes for. In (73b), ‘basket’ is the content meaning of kota-, whereas
‘MASCULINE’ and ‘MIXED’ are the grammatical meanings which this root
subcategorizes for. The word formation rules involving possessed markers can be
described as in (74) —revised later in (81):
RtALIEN + ALIEN

74a. NSt → Rt

MIXRtte 
b. RtALIEN → Rtne 
Rtre1
-te 
b’. ALIEN → -ne 
-re1
c. RtMIX → Rtre2
c’. MIX → -re2
(74a) states the generalization that a possessed noun stem will either consist of a
root lexically marked as [alienable] plus an alienable possessed marker, or of a root
lexically marked as [mixed] plus the mixed possessed marker. (74b) specifies the classes
of alienable roots that take the alienable possessed marker. (74b’) lists the alienable234markers which alienable roots select for. (74c) specifies the class of mixed roots that can
take the mixed possessed marker. Finally, (74c’) lists the mixed possessed marker which
mixed roots select for. Note, however, that the word formation represented in (74) only
takes into consideration the possessed markers. Since (in)alienability and mixing
possession marking have been defined over the morphological marking patterns found
both in possession and unpossession constructions, the word formation rule given in (74)
will need to be revised to include the unpossession marking patterns. This is done in the
next subsection.
The possessed markers in Apurinã are precisely the forms that have been
reconstructed for Proto-Maipuran (David Payne 1991:378-379). That would mean that,
in principle, the Apurinã possessed markers are at least a few thousand years old. It is
possible that only historical-comparative studies within the Maipuran family will provide
clearer evidence as to whether these different possessed markers originated in classifying
systems (e.g. genitive classifiers) or whether they arose through phonological processes
that are no longer transparent in Apurinã.
As an additional observation about possessed markers, I should recall a special
property of the possessed marker -re1. As was shown under 4.1.2, possessed markers
typically occur with a noun base or a bound root base. The qualifier “typically” is used
here precisely because one of the possessed markers, namely -re1, can also attach to verb
forms to derive a possessed noun. The general property of the possessed markers -te, -ne,
and -re2, as described in detail in 4.1.2-4.1.3 in the previous paragraphs, is simply to
mark a noun form as possessed and distinguish the class of alienable from the class of
mixed (and inalienable) nouns, with no other apparent meaning added to it. The
possessed marker -re1, in contrast, aside from being attached to free roots to derive
235possessed noun forms (as amply illustrated in (50) and in Table 18), can also be added to
verbs to derive noun stems, as illustrated in (75):

meaning ‘what you get/feel by V-ing’. That is, -re1 behaves as a sort of possessed object
nominalizer whose derived forms refer to possessed activities or states. To the extent that
at least one of the possessed markers can occur with verbs to derive nouns, they behave
as subcategory changing morphemes. Since -re1 is the only possessed marker that can
occur with verbs to nominalize them, and since it is restricted to a few verbs, it is likely to
constitute an innovation within the possession marking system.","[259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"
"2134.3. Deverbal Nouns
The third category of nouns consists of those that derive from other word
categories and are here simply referred to as nouns derived from other categories. A
noun can be derived by means of suffixation to a verb base, as seen in the next examples.
The first cases illustrated in (60) and (61) below illustrate a different use of some of the
formatives, namely -txi and -re2, described in the previous sections as part of the
(un)possession marking patterns. In (60-61) these formatives are used as nominalizers of
verb forms:
60a. nota nhipoko-ta
1SG food-VBLZ‘I ate.’b. nota apoka-ru
nhipoko-ta-txi
1SG find-3M.O food-VBLZ-UNPOSS
61a. pite kama-ru
2SG make-3M.O‘I found a place-for-eating.’‘You made it.’b. pita kama-re1
2SG make-POSSED‘your work’There are some special types of morphologically complex bound forms such
as -karu and -karo that attach to verbs to derive, respectively, masculine and feminine
noun-like forms referring to the notional subject of the nominalized verb, and such
as -kutu and -kuto that attach to verbs to derive, respectively, masculine and feminine
noun-like forms referring to the notional object of the nominalized verb. These forms
consist of a set of complex formatives marking relative clauses. For now I will only list
the examples in (62), and say that some nominal properties can be associated with the214words marked with these complex formatives. Their full description will be delayed until
the last chapter where the syntax of complex clauses is described. (See also 4.4.)
62a. nota apoka-ru
atama-ta-karu
1SG find-3M.O look-VBLZ-S.M.REL
‘I found the (masculine) one who watches.’
b. nota apoka-ru
atama-ta-karo
1SG find-3M.O look-VBLZ-S.F.REL
‘I found the (feminine) one who watches’
63a. nota apoka-ru nhika-kutu
1SG find-3M.O eat-O.M.REL
‘I found the (masculine) one who was eaten’
b. nota apoka-ru
nhika-kuto
1SG find-3M.O eat-O.F.REL
‘I found the (feminine) one who was eaten’
These, as well as other nominalizing formatives, will be properly described under 4.4
along with the rest of the noun stem morphology. For now it suffices to say that there are
good reasons to argue that the forms given above either form nouns from other categories
or add some nominal properties to verbs. The evidence will be presented as the noun
morphology is described in the next sections. Finally, aside from the property that nouns
derived from other word categories have of being formed of bases belonging to another
part of speech, they also have another important property that distinguishes them from
simple nouns: Nouns derived from other word categories do not subcategorize for
(in)alienability.","[244, 245, 246]"
"Predicate Marking: -ka4
The predicate marker -ka4 occurs attached to word bases that are used aspredicators. Such word bases include (at least) verb bases, noun bases, pronoun bases,
numeral bases, and particle bases. With nouns, pronouns or particles, -ka4 functions as
non-verbal predicate marker, attaching to the head of such a non-verbal predicate
397construction. The examples in (24) illustrate -ka4 with non-verbal predicate
constructions:
24a. popũka-ru-ka4-ra-no
Apurinã-F-PRED-FOC-1SG.O
‘I (really) am Apurinã.’
b. watxa-ka4-ra-ko
ADV.PTC-PRED-FOC-FUT
‘(It) will really be today/now.’
c. hãt-u-ka4-ra-ko
one-M-PRED-FUT
‘(It) will be one.’
d. uwa-putu-ka4-ma-ra-ko
3SG.M-EMPH-PRED-FRUSTR-FOC-FUT
‘(It) would be him but….’
When attached to verb bases, -ka4 has no apparent grammatical meaning or
function, working simply as an optional “filler” or empty formative. I call it “predicate”
marker because it occurs with non-verbal bases when these are in predicate position.
With verbs it can follow the perfectivity markers (as in 20-23), the class2 formatives
habitual, hypothetical, or imminent markers (described in chapter 5), the emphasis
marker (as in 16b), or certain verbal roots, as in (25b) below. The example in (25a)
shows that iri ‘to fall’ is a free verb root (otherwise iri could not take a subject/possessor
pronominal marker and, also, precede a free subject form coreferential with the
pronominal marker); (25b) shows -ka4 following a free verbal root. Note that the
meaning difference between (a) and (b) in (25) is due to the presence/absence of the
perfective marker, and not to the presence/absence of -ka4:39825a. nh-iri-pe
nota
3M-fall-PFTV 1SG
‘I’ve fallen down.’
b. nh-iri-ka4
nota
1SG-fall-PRED 1SG
‘I fell down.’
There are rare clear cases of -ka4 attaching directly to a free verb root such as iri
‘to fall’. There is some evidence that /#irika#/ used to be an unanalyzable form, and that
iri results from a reanalysis of /#irika#/ into /#iri+ka#/. Such a reanalysis would be
motivated by a phonological process of root shortening similar to suka > su ‘to go’,
umaka > uma ‘to sleep’ and so on that happens in natural discourse. iri would be then the
result of a root shortening process that nowadays happens often enough to lead
speakers/hearers to reanalyze it as a full free verbal root. I will not attempt to describe
here such a reanalysis, nor the root shortening phonological process involved in it, simply
because it is still a rather preliminary analysis which still requires a more systematic
verification of the relevant data.
The reason to say that -ka4 carries no grammatical meaning or function when
attached to verbs is that whatever verb bases it occurs with no meaning is
added/subtracted by its presence/absence, and, moreover, its presence is optional, as the
next examples in (26) show (in these examples parentheses indicate that the form is
optional):4
26a. owa
txita-pi-(ka4)
3SG.F fight-HAB-(PRED)
‘She is always fighting.’4In some speech varieties, however, -ka seems to be in a dependency relation with the morphemes -pi, -napano, and
-putu such that it cannot be omitted when co-occurring with any of these morphemes.","[428, 429, 430]"
"Subject/Possessor Pronominal Markers
The subject/possessor pronominal markers, briefly mentioned in theintroduction to chapter 5, in section 5.0, consist of the set of bound pronominal
formatives that can attach to nouns to express the possessor in a possession construction
or to verbs to function as the subject marker. These pronominal markers, listed in Table
3791, inflect for number, person and for the gender of third person singular: (See chapter 3,
in subsection 3.6.2, for the allomorphic variations of these pronominal markers.)

nupuuo-PL

special bound formatives: first, because they are in complementary distribution with
coreferential preverbal subject NPs as well as with coreferential independent
(pro)nominal possessors, and, second, because they can be described as attaching to both
noun as well as verb bases. The list in (3-4) illustrates the pronominal markers both with
verb forms and with noun forms:

2PL-head.of‘They ran.’‘their head’
g. u-kuwu(-na)
3-head.of-3PLThese examples illustrate the fact that the same pronominal forms attach to noun forms as
well as to verb forms. Moreover, these pronominal markers are interpreted as subject
markers when attached to verb bases, as shown in (3), and as possessor markers when
attached to noun bases, as shown in (4). In (3) the standard intransitive verb muteka ‘to
run’ (which could be replaced with any other standard intransitive verb or with any
transitive verb, as many of the examples seen so far illustrate) inflect for person, number
and (in the case of third person singular) gender. In (4) the alienable noun form kuwu
‘head of’ takes the corresponding pronominal forms that attach to noun bases to function
as possessors. As was mentioned in the introduction to chapter 5, the formative -na in
(4g) is a plural marker that is in a discontinuous dependency relation with the third
person marker u-. That is, in order to express third person plural subject/possessor by
means of the subject/possessor pronominal markers, the third person marker u- is
prefixed to a verb/noun form and the third person plural marker -na is suffixed to the
verb/noun form. Insofar as both u- and -na need to co-occur in order for the semantic
‘third person plural’ to be expressed through bound forms, u- and -na are in a
discontinuous dependency relation. Since all special bound formatives are presented
following the internal distribution in their host, and since u- and -na have distinct
distributions within their host base, -na will only be properly presented later in subsection
7.1.13. Furthermore, -na is in parenthesis in (4g) to represent the fact that nowadays not
all speakers make use of the plural marker -na in expressing third person plural. Some
381speakers use, instead, only the form u- to express both third person singular masculine
and third person plural masculine or feminine.1
Note that these pronominal forms, when attached to noun forms as possessor
markers, are not simply possession markers that are co-indexed with the ""real"" free
expression of a nominal possessor; in fact, they are in complementary distribution with
free nominal possessors, as shown by the examples in (5): (Underlining marks
coreference.)
5a. *nota nu-nuro
1SG 1SG-mother.of
(my mother)
b. *pita pu-nuro
2SG 2SG-mother.of
(your mother)
c. *kuku u-nuro
3SG 3M-mother.of
(man's mother)
d. *suto
o-nuro
woman 3M-mother.of
(woman's mother)
etc...
When used with verbs as subject markers, pronominal markers differ in one
particular way from the more familiar agreement markers found in various other
languages (e.g., Romance languages in general). In Apurinã, the subject/possessor
pronominal markers are in complementary distribution with the coreferential pre-verbal1In my last visit to the field, I also found that in some speech varieties the plural marker –na works as a plurality
marker for both third person non-object and third person object. For example, in the Fortaleza village (Marahã area),
‘They looked at me’ is uttered as Ø-etama-ta-no-ne (3-look-VBLZ-1O-PL) and ‘I looked at them’ is uttered as382free subject (pro)nominal forms. That is, whereas pronominal markers used as possessors
are in complete complementary distribution with any coreferential free (pro)nominal
forms expressing the possessor, these same pronominal markers, when used as subject
markers in verbs, are in complementary distribution with pre-verbal, but NOT with postverbal, coreferential free (pro)nominal expressions of the subject. The complementary
distribution is shown by the three examples in (6):
u-su-pe
6a. *uwa
3SG.M 3M-go-PFTV
(He has left.)
b. *suto
o-apo-pe
3SG.F 3F-arrive-PFTV
(The woman has arrived.)
c. *suto
o-apa-nanu-ta-ru
aõtu
woman 3F-fetch-PROG-VBLZ-3M.O umari
(The woman was gathering “umari” fruit.)
d. *nota nhi-nhika-ru
nhi-nhipoko-re
1SG 1SG-eat-3M.O 1SG-food-POSSED
(I ate my food.)
In (6a) the clause is ungrammatical because the pre-verbal independent pronoun
uwa ‘3SG.M’ co-occurs with the coreferential subject/possessor pronominal marker u-; in
(6b) the clause is ungrammatical because the pre-verbal nominal form suto ‘woman’ cooccurs with the coreferential subject/possessor pronominal marker o- ‘3M.O’; finally, in
(6c-d) both clauses are ungrammatical because the pre-verbal noun form suto and the preverbal independent pronoun nota ‘1SG’ co-occur, respectively, with the coreferential
pronominal markers o- in (6c) and nhi- (6d).n-etama-ta—ne (1SG-see-VLBZ-PL). At this point I do not know how the potential ambiguityis resolved in cases383In contrast to pre-verbal free subject (pro)nominal forms and their coreferential
pronominal markers, there is no complementary distribution between free post-verbal
(pro)nominal forms and their corresponding coreferential subject/possessor pronominal
markers in the verb, as the examples in (7) demonstrate:
7a. u-su-pe
uwa
3M-go-PFTV 3SG.M
‘He has left.’
b. o-apo-pe
suto
3F-arrive-PFTV woman
‘The woman has arrived.’
c. aõtu o-apa-nanu-ta-ru
suto
umari 3F-fetch-PROG-VBLZ-3M.O woman
‘The woman was gathering “umari” fruit.
d. nhi-nhipoko-re
nhi-nhika-ru
nota
1SG-food-POSSED 1SG-eat-3M.O 1SG
‘I ate my food.’
Therefore, the descriptive facts reveal that (i) subject/possessor markers attached
to verb forms are mutually exclusive with coreferential free pre-verbal (pro)nominal
forms (but not with postverbal ones), that (ii) subject/possessor markers attached to noun
forms are mutually exclusive with any free coreferential (pro)nominal element, and, also,
that (iii) pronominal markers are obligatory if no pre-verbal nominal is found in a clause
—although the converse is not true (see also 9.7.2).
The reason why the meaning ‘possessor’ is not included as part of the gloss of
these pronominal markers in the examples above is that the meaning ‘possessor’ can be
described as a function of the slot these markers occupy in the noun base, rather than aswhere both core arguments are non-coreferential third person plural.","[410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415]"
"1283.3.1Morphemes, Morphs, Formatives, Allomorphs
Perhaps the second issue where morphologists diverge the most, after the definitionof “word”, is as to how to define the notion of a “morpheme” (for those who believe there is
such a thing). Instead of going through attempts to establish an independent definition of
the term (and at the risk of some circularity), I will simply refer to morpheme as an abstract
morphological construct that is particularly useful in describing word structure in Apurinã.
A word may have one or more morpheme in an analogous way that it can also have one or
more phoneme. Since a morpheme is an abstract morphological unit, it requires a phonetic
shape in order to be audibly expressed. The phonetic expression of a morpheme is a morph,
analogously to phone (i.e. the phonetic expression of a phoneme). Moreover, since it is a
common assumption in the morphological literature that “the term ‘morph’ implies the
realization of a morpheme” (Bauer 1994), so much so that a morph that does not realize a
morpheme is called an empty morph, I will reserve the term formative to refer to both
morphs that do and morphs that do not realize a morpheme; also, I will use the term
formative when I want to be intentionally vague (or neutral) as to whether a form realizes or
not a morpheme (Idem, Anderson 1985:150, 161). “Formative” will then be the superordinate term for morph and empty morph (in a way roughly similar to the term
exponent/exponency, also found in the literature, Bauer 1994:243 and Spencer 1991:41).
Finally, morphs that do realize a morpheme and that are conditioned by a phonological,
lexical or grammatical context will be called allomorphs of that morpheme (Bauer 1994:15,
analogously to allophone in phonology). The difference between the notion ‘allomorph’ and
the notion ‘morph’ is that it is part of the definition of the former that its phonetic realization129is conditioned by the phonology, lexicon or the grammar of the language. Such
conditioning factors are not part of the notion ‘morph’.
Having introduced the labels above, I will now summarize the sort of properties that
will be considered relevant for the identification of formatives in the language. As was the
case for words, morphemes can also be described in terms of their form and meaning. In the
ideal cases each morphemic form will correspond to a specific meaning, so that the ideal
morphemes will consist of a particular form that is consistently associated with one specific
meaning. This is the so-called one-to-one mapping between form and meaning (Anderson
1988:151-153). If, however, all there was to a morphological description was the
description of one-to-one mappings between the forms and meanings of various formatives
there would probably be no reason to even describe morphology separately from syntax. In
some cases it is not easy to decide whether certain forms constitute allomorphs of the same
morpheme, different morphemes, or whether they even are segmentable formatives at all. It
is precisely because many other factors may be involved in the identification of formatives,
aside from the form-meaning mapping, that I will make use of a list of factors which will
constitute useful guidelines in the identification of morphemes. The list of factors used here
follows partly from an extrapolation of the properties described in Bauer 1994, chapter 8, as
those identifying affixes and bases. The properties to be considered in the identification of
formatives are then as in (9):
9a. meaning of a putative formative;
b. function of a putative formative (verbalizer, nominalizer etc);
c. (phonological) form of a putative formative;
d. part of speech of the word base (noun, verb etc.) that a putative formative attaches to;130e. phonological, grammatical or semantic restrictions on the word base that a putative
formative attaches to;
f. range of allomorphs displayed by a putative formative;
g. form a putative formative imposes to the word base;
h. whether a putative formative is required before another formative can occur in the same
word base, i.e. whether it potentiates a subsequent formative;
i. degrees of productivity of a putative formative;
j. whether a putative formative occupies a position class in the base;
k. whether a putative formative is in complementary distribution with another one;
l. recurrence of a putative formative.
No single property in (9) is used here as a necessary and sufficient condition for the
identification of a formative; rather, the list constitutes a range of properties commonly
associated with formatives that can be analyzed as morphemes or allomorphs or empty
morphs. When used in combination these properties will serve as a set of procedures to
identify not only the general morphological unit formative (as opposed to morphologically
inconsequent phonological chunks), but also the sub-type of formative in question, i.e.
allomorph, morpheme or empty morph. The data to be represented in chapters 4-7 will
provide examples where some of the decisions on whether a formative constitutes a
morpheme or not will be, ultimately, a theory-driven judgment. However, the properties
listed in (9) will (hopefully) provide completely consistent results. Table 1 lists the values
for each of the relevant properties that will determine whether a putative formative realizes a
morpheme, allomorphs of a single morpheme, or an empty morph, or whether the putative
formative is just a morphologically inconsequent phonological chunk:131Table 1: Defining Properties of Formatives

I- Meaning: Morphemes and allomorphs will normally have a meaning systematically
associated with them, whereas both empty morphs and non-formatives will not;
II- Function: Morphemes and allomorphs may have a function associated with them (e.g.
nominalizer, verbalizer, etc.), whereas both empty morphs and non-formatives will not;
III- Form: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs will normally have a constant
shape with predictable variations, whereas non-formatives will not;
IV- Part of Speech of base (P.O.S.): Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may be
restricted to a specific word category, whereas this may not happen to non-formatives;
V- Restrictions on base: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may also be
restricted to bases with specific phonological or semantic properties, whereas this does
not happen to non-formatives;
VI- Range of allomorphs: Morphemes and empty morphs may not only exhibit
allomorphic variants, but also different morphemes and different empty morphs may
exhibit distinct allomorphic variants, whereas non-formatives may not exhibit such
variants at all;
VII- Form imposed on base: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may cause
systematic changes in the underlying form of a base, whereas non-formatives will not;
VIII- Potentiation of other formative: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may132“create a suitable base for” another formative, whereas non-formatives will not;
IX- Degree of productivity: Morphemes and empty morphs may exhibit degrees of
productivity that may be used to distinguish between two morphemes or two empty
morphs, whereas non-formatives may not;
X- Position class: Morphemes, their allomorphs, and empty morphs may occupy a
position class in the word it occurs within, whereas non-formatives will not;
XI- Complementary distribution: Allomorphs of the same morpheme will always be
mutually exclusive, whereas morphemes, empty morphs or non-formatives will not;
XII- Recurrence: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs will recur in the word
bases they are allowed to occur, whereas non-formatives will not;
Therefore the list given in Table 1 works as sort of tests to determine whether
something is a formative or not, and what type of formative it is. As seen in this table, every
positive value assigned to the category morpheme implies a positive value to the category
allomorph. This follows from the assumption that every morpheme is necessarily realized
as at least one allomorph. Thus wherever there is a morpheme there will necessarily be at
least one allomorph, whereas the converse does not hold. The application of the tests given
above will be illustrated as they are applied in chapters 4-6.
A necessary initial step in the description of the structure of words is to establish
(preliminarily) the classes of words found in the language. Some introductory notes on the
major classes of words found in the language are in order and are presented next.","[159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"

simply can never occur unpossessed. If nouns for kin terms never occur unpossessed, the
situations in which they would be required to take the unpossessed marker -txi never
arise. Furthermore, the motivating factor underlying the non-occurrence of kin terms in
unpossessed contexts can be construed as consisting of the socio-cultural correlates of
inalienability in Apurinã. In other words, inalienability, in this case, is defined for
Apurinã as the grammatical expression of special types of relationships involving
possessor and possessee which have become conventionalized enough so as to disallow a
completely semantic account of it but which, nevertheless, still partially reflect sociocultural aspects of the Apurinã society. In this sense, if inalienability is described as161some sort of grammatical encoding of (conventionalized and especially close
socio-cultural) relationships between the possessor and the possessee, the expression of
biological relationships is then the one which encodes the highest degree of closeness
between the possessor and the possessee in Apurinã, followed by body parts
relationships, personal belongings relationships plus abstract relationships, and, perhaps a
small residue of other relationships. (For views of inalienability along these lines see
Heine 1997, Chappel and McGregor 1996b, Facundes 1994a and 1995a, Chappel and
McGregor 1989, Carlson and Payne 1989, and Nichols 1988). I will leave unexplored
here the full details of such a general analysis of inalienability marking in Apurinã,
referring to Facundes (1995a and 199a) for earlier and more detailed analyses of the
formal and conceptual underpinnings of inalienability marking in this language.
4.1.1.2 Simple Inalienable Classificatory Nouns
In contrast to simple inalienable non-classificatory nouns such as kuwu, there are
other inalienable nouns that differ from kuwu-type nouns in being, for example, both
phonologically bound forms and in having the property of recurring as part of compound
nouns. These nouns are here called (simple inalienable) classificatory nouns. For
example, a noun such as -tsota is an inalienable noun (thus, lexically marked as
obligatorily possessed) meaning ‘trunk of’ (where ‘trunk’ is the part of a tree). If marked
with the third person masculine singular form u-, as in u-tsota, it will mean ‘its trunk’.
The property of taking a person marker that functions as a possessor is a feature intrinsic
to nouns (cf. function of person markers with verbs in 5.0). Hence, classificatory nouns
such as -tsota can be considered to constitute a subclass of simple nouns that happen to
be phonologically bound, i.e. a bound noun.
162Overall, there are at least four ways in which inalienable nouns such as -tsota
constitute a special type of noun, i.e. a classificatory noun. First, such classificatory
nouns are generally phonologically bound nouns insofar as they occur either as part of a
compound word base (as in oko-tsota ‘trunk of “oko” tree’) or with a pronominal marker
attached to them (as in u-tsota ‘its trunk’). Second, classificatory nouns can RECUR as
part of a compound noun. That is, as long as the semantics allows it, a classificatory
noun can repeatedly occur as part of various compound nouns, as illustrated in (16). The
compound nouns formed with non-classificatory nouns plus one (or more) classificatory
noun(s) are the productive compound nouns that will be specifically dealt with in 4.2.1.

plant-trunk-trunk.ofNotice that the types of compounds taking classificatory nouns above are somewhat
parallel to compound nouns in English such as banana tree, mango tree, apple tree etc.,
where tree also recurs as part of the compound. Different from English, however, words
that are used with a generic meaning as part of a compound in Apurinã are bound
formatives. Even if speakers were to accept a neologism such as, e.g., kema-kuwu
‘tapir’s head’, under some special circumstances, still the non-classificatory inalienable
noun kuwu ‘head of’ will NOT have the property of recurring as part of compound nouns.
That is, the non-classificatory noun kuwu cannot be systematically used as part of the
compound nouns in (17):

constructions, but not in compound nouns, as shown in (18): (As will be further seen
under 4.2, a major difference between compound nouns and branched phrasal nominals is
that the former carry only one primary stress —omitted in the standardized transcription
used here— whereas the latter will carry as many primary stresses as the number of
phonologically independent words present in the phrasal construction.)

resemble -berry in English (as in cranberry, strawberry, blackberry etc.) However, the
similarities end there. The third special property of classificatory nouns (more precisely,
a subset of them) is that they can be incorporated into the verb to refer to the semantic
properties of a nominal form previously referred in the discourse. So, in (19a) the
classificatory noun -pe ‘pulp of’ is incorporated into the verb base usonãka-ta-ka
‘dry-VBLZ-INTENS’ to refer to a consistency property of the nominal form komuru that
164precedes the verb in the same clause. In (19b) the classificatory noun xiti ‘earth.of’ is
incorporated into the verb base yotika-ta ‘burn-VBLZ’ to refer anaphorically to the noun
form kikio ‘field farm’ which had been previously mentioned in the text:
19a. ata komuru usonãka-pe-ta-ka
1PL manioc dry-pulp.of-VBLZ-CAUS
‘We put the manioc pulp to dry.’ (QP1:24)
b. Preceding context: ‘First, we prepare the field farm by cutting down the trees... then...’
ata yotika-xiti-ta
txa-ru
1PL burn-earth.of-VBLZ AUX-3M.OBJ
‘....we set it (the field farm) on fire.’
Finally, there is one last major reason to distinguish classificatory from nonclassificatory nouns, namely the properties that motivate further subcategorization within
the class of classificatory nouns. These properties will be fully described in the following
subsections and, although they refer to the lexical semantics of classificatory nouns, they
are relevant in that they illustrate important form-meaning mappings that will help us
understand the current morphological status of classificatory nouns. The notion of
‘meaning’ relevant for the foregoing discussion is that of ‘lexical meaning’ (rather than
‘propositional’ or ‘pragmatic’ meaning). Before examining such properties in detail,
however, some labels for the subcategories need to be introduced. A subset of
classificatory nouns, hereafter C(lassificatory) N(oun)1, can only be used with their
“literal meaning”, while others, hereafter C(lassificatory) N(oun)2, can also have their
meaning “metaphorically extended” beyond their literal meaning.5 ‘Literal meaning’
here means the original meaning of the lexical item as determined by an internal5The definitions of CN1 and CN2 here differ slightly from those given in Facundes 1994 and 1998. Here the two165semantic reconstruction. Literal meaning will be hereafter referred to as the source
meaning. “Metaphorically extended meaning”, as the name suggests, means that the
source meaning is generalized to cover more generic (or abstract) nuances of meaning
and, as a consequence, the (potential) semantic scope of the classificatory noun is
extended to a wider range of items. Metaphorically extended meaning will be hereafter
referred to as target meaning.6
Classificatory nouns are then those that generally follow the pattern summarized
in Table 8, where RtINAL.CL belongs to the subset of inalienable roots that can be used
with classificatory function (i.e. with a somewhat recurrent meaning as part of the
meaning of productive compound nouns):

20. NINAL.CL → RtINAL.CLinalienable noun categories do not overlap, while in previous definitions some overlapping was allowed. The
present definitions are preferable because they capture more fine grained contrastive noun properties.
6
The notions of ‘source’ and ‘target’ meanings used here partly follow from the work of Lakoff and Johnson 1982,
Lakoff 1987 on metaphors, and from the notion of “Generalization” discussed in Bybee et al 1994.","[192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197]"
"420As was briefly mentioned in the previous subsection, of all the 14 position classes
occupied by the special bound formatives described earlier (7.1.1-7.1.14), only those
occupied by the oblique markers and the restrictive marker cannot be part of a verb base.
Conversely, only the gerund marker, the “passive” marker, and the object markers cannot
be part of a typical noun base. Although a more complete survey is necessary in order to
determine exactly which closed word classes can take any of the special bound
formatives, the preliminary evidence presented above suggests that all special bound
formatives that attach to a noun base also attach to one or more of the closed word
classes. For the purpose of describing the general distributional properties of special
bound formatives, these formatives can be presented in terms of whether they occur with
verb bases, with noun bases, with closed class word bases, or with a combination of these
bases. Table 4, where “other bases” refer to any one or more word bases that belong to
closed word classes, summarizes the information about the word category of the possible
host bases of each one of the special bound formatives:421Table 4: Special Bound Formatives and the Category of Their Host Base

+A general property shared by almost all special bound formatives, which is made
explicit in Table 4, is the fact that, except for the gerund, “passive”, and object markers,
every other special bound formative attaches to two or more distinct word categories.
Conversely, except for the gerund marker, “passive”, and object markers, no other special
bound formative occurs exclusively with one word category. Hence, out of 14 slots for
special bound formatives, 7 are found in with at least three distinct word categories, 4 are
found with two word categories, and 3 are found with one word category (namely, the
verb). The property that special bound formatives have of occurring with one or more
host bases of distinct word categories can be used to classify special bound formatives
into three types, as represented in Table 5. In this table, special bound formatives that
attach to host bases of three or more word categories are termed floating special bound
formatives; those that attach to host bases of at least two word categories are termed
quasi-floating special bound formatives; and, those that attach to host bases of one422specific word category are termed non-floating special bound formatives:

OBJECTTherefore, the general tendency is for special bound formatives to be floating or
quasi-floating rather than non-floating. On these grounds, some qualifications need to be
made about the non-floating minority subset of special bound formatives. Such
qualifications apply to the presence/absence of oblique markers in verb bases, to the
presence/absence of object markers in noun bases, and to the status of the “passive”
marker in the language. First, at least some oblique markers are found in deverbal-like
bases. Deverbal-like bases are the word forms that show both noun and verb properties,
and that consist of a verb plus the gerund marker or plus a relativizer. The examples
below constitute instances of an oblique marker attached to deverbal-like bases: The goal
marker -mokaru attaches to V-inhi in (51a) and to V-kuto in (51b):
51a. aiko
nota s-inhi-mokaru
house 1SG go-GER-GOAL
‘My going to the house...’
423b. i-txa
kema owa
hãtako-ro Ø-anhi-kuto-mokaru
3M-say tapir 3SG.F youth-F
3M-take-REL.F.O-GOAL
‘The tapir said to her, the woman whom it took away.’
A detailed discussion of the nominal and verbal properties of V-inhi and V-kuto will be
presented within the appropriate syntactic context in chapter 9, in 9.1.2.2.3 and 9.1.1.6,
respectively.
The second qualification to be made is about the presence/absence of object
markers in noun bases. There is a limited set of noun forms that take the object marker
when these noun forms function as the predicator in a clause. The examples in (52)
present instances of noun bases that function as predicators of non-verbal clauses, and
that take the first person object marker –no, in (52a-b), or the second person object
marker -i, in (52c-d), to encode the sole argument of the predicator:
52a. kiyomane-txi-nhi-pẽ-ka-no

b. kona hãtako-ru-ka-no

c. popũka-ru-ka4-ra-i

‘Are you’re Apurinã.’
d. kãkutu-ka4-ra-i
person-M-PRED-FOC-2SG.O
‘Are you’re a (white) person.’
The third qualification, about the functional status of the “passive” marker, is that,
as was made explicit in 7.1.8, the grammatical function/meaning of the “passive” marker
may be undergoing changes in the language, going from a passive marker to a marker of
424a specific subtype of perfectivity. These changes, however, require a better
understanding. At the present time, the current data available do not allow a conclusive
analysis of the function of the “passive” marker or of the distribution of this formative in
terms of the range of the host bases it attaches to. That is, it still is possible that the fact
that the “passive” marker has been attested only with verb bases may be an artifact of the
data available.
Examples such as those in (51-52) would then seem to suggest that some of the
cases (of non-floating formatives) that are listed in Table 5 as possible exceptions to the
predominant (quasi-)floating property of special bound formatives would actually be no
exceptions. However, in the present work, I will maintain the exceptional status of the
oblique markers as well as of the object markers for two specific reasons. The first
reason is that the deverbal-like bases share both noun and verb properties (as will be later
shown in detail in chapter 9, in 9.1.1.6 and 9.1.2.2.3). The second reason is that
examples such as (52), where an object marker attaches to a predicator noun base, so far
have been attested in the speech of a single speaker. It is possible that examples such as
those in (52) are specific to a speech variety that still requires further investigation, in
which case it remains to be shown how representative such examples are of the
morphosyntactic properties of non-verbal clauses in the language. (Non-verbal clauses
are described in chapter 8, in 8.4.2.) Nonetheless, if the status of the gerund, “passive”,
and object marker turns out to be confirmed as non-floating formatives, they would still
differ from the typical affixes found in the language, even if only insofar as they occur
outside of typical affixes in the same way as do (quasi-)floating special bound formatives.
Here may be a good place to note that it is NOT the case that the distribution of
special bound formatives can be predicted in any obvious way on the basis of the surface
425syntactic structure of the language as it applies to free (i.e., non-phonologically bound)
word forms. In other words, although special bound formatives may occur most often in
a particular position in the clause, they do not occupy fixed positions, for example, at the
edge of phrases or clauses. Take, as a first example, the perfective marker -pe. -pe is a
floating special bound formative that occurs most often attached to verb forms. In (53a)
-pe is shown attached to a clause-final verb; in (53b) it occurs attached to a main verb
which precedes the clause-final auxiliary verb; and, in (53c) it attaches to a verb form that
occurs clause initially:
53a. oposo uwa
kema anhika
txa-pe-ro
PTC 3SG.M tapir take.away AUX-PFTV-3F.O
‘So, the tapir, it took her away.’
b. oposo uwa-kata

‘Then she went with it.’
c. ĩ-imata-pe-ro
owa
3M-mate-PFTV-3F.O 3SG.F
‘It had intercourse with her.’
As an instance of a non-floating special bound formative, take the gerund marker
-inhi. -inhi is non-floating because it attaches only to verb bases, as was shown in 0. As
the examples in (54) illustrate, -inhi can occur in host verb bases that are in clause-final,
clause-medial or clause-initial position:
54a. i-ye
komeru i-ye
katarokuru a-kam-inhi
M-PROX manioc M-PROX manioc.flour 1PL-make-GER
‘…our making of this manioc and of this manioc flour.’

‘In remembering of my cousin, I came here.’
426c. a-yana-poko-t-inhi
uwã
1PL-walk-DISTR-VBLZ-GER there
‘Our visiting around there...’
However, although examples such as (54c) can be attested in spontaneous discourse, it is
the case that the verb base taking -inhi rarely occurs clause initially. That is, the norm is
for -inhi to occur with host bases in clause-medial or clause-final position. This
“dispreference” for the clause initial position is most likely to follow from two properties
of the gerund marker: First,-inhi generally functions as a marker of subordinated clause
(as will be shown in chapter 9, under 9.1), and it happens that Apurinã subordinate
clauses tend to follow rather than precede the matrix clause. Second, -inhi attaches to
verb bases and, as it happens, verbs normally occur in clause—medial or in clause-final
position —when one or more free argument expression(s) is/are found in the clause (as
will be shown in chapter 8, in 8.9.5). Hence, the “dispreference” for clause-initial
position for the host base -inhi to attach to is a by-product of the functional properties of
-inhi as well as of the distributional properties of its host verb base, NOT the result of any
syntactic rule applying to -inhi itself.
As an instance of a quasi-floating special bound formative, take the restrictive
marker -nanu. As (55) illustrates, -nanu occurs with (pro)nominal host bases that are in
clause-initial or in clause-medial position:
watxa ata nhi-pe
55a. a-serota-re-nanu-ra
1PL-salt-POSSED-RESTR-FOC today 1PL eat-PFTV
‘Nowadays (it’s) only with salt that we eat.’

‘…it was only the language of the elders that we’d go about learning.’
In contrast to the gerund marker, the restrictive marker simply does not occur (in text
material) in host bases that are in clause-final position. This restriction, however, again is
more likely to follow from the meaning properties of the restrictive marker, rather than
from a purely syntactic constraint on its distribution. -nanu individualizes the referential
properties of the (pro)nominal base it attaches too roughly in the same way that the word
only, just and alone do in English. In doing so, -nanu restricts the application of the
meaning conveyed by the predicator of the clause and highlights the importance of the
referent expressed by the (pro)nominal base which -nanu attaches to. Thus, the
“dispreference” for clause-final position is likely to follow from the discourse-pragmatic
properties associated with -nanu. Analogous discourse-pragmatic properties can be more
easily shown to play a role in the placement of the focus of attention marker, -ra
(described in 7.1.11). -ra is a floating special bound formative whose function is to bring
the focus of attention onto the word base to which it attaches. Thus, the
function/meaning of -ra is clearly a discourse one. As it happens, the host bases to which
-ra attaches show strong preference for clause-initial position, although it can sometimes
occur clause-medially. The examples in (56) illustrate the distribution of -ra:

‘Then it would be with him that we’d go.’
-ra occurs in the first word in the clause in (56a, c). Notice that, as it is clear in (56b, d),
the actual preference is not for -ra to occur in the first word; instead, the strong
preference is for the phrasal constituent (rather than simply the word form) with which
-ra occurs to be positioned clause-initially. Moreover, as illustrated in (56e-f), when the
phrasal constituents in which -ra is found do occur clause-medially, these phrasal
constituents are generally preceded by a clause-initial discourse particle —which do not
constitute constituents of the clause. (A detailed discussion of constituent structure will
be presented in chapter 8, in 8.1-2) Here, again the strong preference for a specific
position inside the clause is not necessarily determined by any syntactic constraint but,
instead, it follows from the meaning and functional properties of the special formative in
question. In the case of -ra, it makes perfect sense (from a discourse and cognitive
perspective) to place in the beginning of the clause the construction whose focus of
attention is called for.
429One last important aspect of the distribution of special bound formatives in the
clause is that at least some of them can occur more than once in different host bases in the
same clausal construction —in a way reminiscent of agreement markers in other
languages. It is this repetition of the same special bound formative in the same clausal
construction that is illustrated by the examples in (57): (Repeated forms are underlined in
these examples.)

(57a) illustrates the occurrence of the affectedness marker both in a subject
expression and in a relativized verb form. (57b) illustrates the occurrence of the
frustrative marker both in an associative expression and in a verb form. (57c) illustrates
the occurrence of both frustrative and the future markers in an associative expression and
in a verb form. Finally, (57d-e) illustrate, respectively, the occurrence of the perfective
and the predicate markers both in the main verb and in the auxiliary forms. No case has
been attested where the same special bound form occurs both in a verb form and in its
430expression of its object. Also, no case has been attested of the same special bound
formative being used both in the possessor and in the possessed forms in the same
possession construction. Exactly what the factors determining if/when a special bound
formative can or cannot be repeated in a clausal construction still needs to be determined.
Nevertheless, there is no indication that there is any grammatical factor(s) that is/are
systematically associated with the agreement-like property of some special bound
formatives. In fact, the repetition of the same special bound formative within a syntactic
construction is structurally optional, and, most likely, is motivated by discoursepragmatic factors still to be determined. Nevertheless, regardless of what the motivating
factors are, the fact that some special bound formatives can be repeated in the same
construction constitutes an important distinction between these special bound formatives
and any of the affix forms described in the previous chapters.","[451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462]"

head.of-UNPOSS go-PFTV
‘The head person left.’ (In this case ‘head’ refers to a mythological personage who only
exists as a head, with no other body parts.)
In (4), as everywhere else in this work, inalienable nouns are glossed as ‘N of’,
where “N” is the lexical meaning of the inalienable noun in question and “of” marks it as
obligatorily possessed. Thus, in the analysis proposed here, obligatory possession is part
of the lexical entry of inalienable nouns; that is, it is stored with the lexical entries of
inalienable nouns, rather than added by morphosyntactic rules. As seen (4a), no
morphological marker is added when an inalienable noun occurs possessed, and, as a
consequence, the syntactic context in which inalienable nouns occur possessed is one
where two nouns are placed together by juxtaposition. On the other hand, when
inalienable nouns occur unpossessed they require the presence of the unpossession
marker -txi:
The example given in (4) may suggest that possession constructions such as
[kema kuwu] can be described purely in terms of the syntactic structure internal to the
nominal phrase. In this case, the possession relation would not be marked by any lexical
property of the possessed noun but, instead, by a syntactic distribution in which the
possessor would always precede the possessed noun. However, while this “precedence
rule” is a necessary part of the grammar of possession constructions in the language, it is
not sufficient to describe them. The reason is a twofold one: First, it is necessary to refer
to the lexical property of inalienable nouns in order to describe which ones take the
unpossessed suffix -txi; second, it is necessary to refer to their lexical property also in
order to explain why they do not take the possessed suffixes described below for
alienable nouns.
153The general possessed and unpossessed morphological marking pattern is given in
Table 1. RtINAL belongs to the set of roots that are lexically marked as possessed, thus
requiring no morphological marking to occur possessed, and that require the -txi suffix to
occur unpossessed —where semantically/pragmatically possible. Put in a different way,
inalienable nouns would be covertly marked for possession (covert possession is
represented by “Ø” in Table 1) and overtly marked for unpossession. In the last column
of Table 1, as in other tables below, “NA” (not applicable) is used to mark the cases
where semantics or pragmatics does not allow a RtINAL to be realized as an unpossessed
noun:
Table 1: Marking Patterns for Inalienable Nouns
Root ClassPossessed MarkingUnpossessed MarkingRtINAL-Ø-txi/NAThus, the simplest word formation rule for these nouns is as follows:
5. NINAL → RtINAL (+ txi)
As the next subsections will illustrate, the class of simple inalienable nouns
include body parts, plant parts, personal belongs, kinship terms, among others, and
although it must constitute a closed subclass of nouns it still includes at least a few
hundred words. Based on whether they can be used with classificatory functions or not,
inalienable nouns can be further subcategorized as non-classificatory or classificatory
nouns. The morphological properties of both non-classificatory and classificatory nouns
are described next.
1544.1.1.1 Simple Inalienable Non-Classificatory Nouns
(Simple inalienable) non-classificatory nouns are simple inalienable common
nouns. An example of non-classificatory noun is kuwu ‘head of’, illustrated in (4). These
nouns follow the (un)possessed marking pattern given in Table 2, where RtINAL.NON-CL
belongs to the subset of inalienable roots (i.e. RtINAL) that cannot be used with the
classificatory function:

Lists of RtINALs are given in Tables 3-6. As the data below suggest, the majority of
RtINALs that -txi attaches to refer to body parts or body-related meanings, second to
personal belongings and abstract (non-tactile) concepts, and, third, to other types of
concepts:155Table 3: The Unpossessed Nouns Marked with -txi: Body Parts

"307functions of these formatives are, and about how they can be shown to cluster together in
different morphological classes. The sequence of presentation of each formative (or set
of formatives) in the following subsections, unless otherwise noted, follows their
sequential ordering of occurrence inside the verb.
5.2.1.1 Formatives Meaning, Function, and Distribution within Verb Base1: Class1
Class1 formatives are those consisting of the bound verbal formatives that attach
to baseØ to form (Verb) Base1 and that require the presence of the verbalizer -ta.
Formatives from class1 are in a dependency relation with -ta, and that is why (in all the
examples given under this section) every time there is a formative of class1 in a verb base
there will also be the verbalizer -ta closing that base. For example, while a verb form
such as nhi-yana-poko-ta (1SG-walk-DISTR-VBLZ) ‘I go for a walk’ exists, a form such
as *nhi-yana-poko does NOT because -poko is a formative of class1 and thus requires the
presence of -ta. Further illustration of this dependency relation can be seen as each of the
formatives of class1 is presented in the following subsections, as well as in 5.2.1.1.14
—where -ta is described. Since class1 formatives are defined as the set of bound verbal
formatives that attach to baseØ to form base1 and which require the presence of the
verbalizer -ta, it follows then that -ta is not a class1 formative. In fact, -ta will be shown
in the next subsection to belong to the a second class of bound formatives.
Base1 is then the result of the combination of baseØ plus class1 formatives. The
presentation of these formatives will be given in the following sequence: The
grammatical function and/or meaning which each formative of class1 has will be
described first; then the evidence for position classes is presented next, followed by the
overall distribution of these formatives in the verb. In many cases the meaning and/or
308function of the formatives will be described superficially in this chapter and, in such
cases, I will return to them in chapters 8-10 in the required syntactic contexts. However,
as mentioned earlier, even if the meaning and/or function of a formative turns out to be
better understood in conjunction with phrasal or clausal considerations, the assumption
held in this work is that their place inside the grammatical word needs to obey
morphological parsing principles as well and, as such, requires a morphological
description.
5.2.1.1.1Meaning and/or Function of Formatives within Class1Meaning and function are different things in the sense that, for example, a
causative marker can mean ‘to cause’, so that a form such as V-causative will mean
‘cause to V’, and, at the same time, this same causative marker can also have the function
of transitivizing an intransitive verb. Also, meaning and functions are not necessary
concurrent properties of a morpheme (see criteria for defining a morpheme in chapter 3,
under 3.3.1), since, for example, a morpheme can have a clear function (e.g., verbalizer,
nominalizer etc.) but no semantically definable meaning —except for very abstract ones
which, in such cases, are precisely what I call “functions” rather than “meaning”.
5.2.1.1.1.1Distributive Event/Directional Marking: -pokoThe distributive action marker -poko attaches to baseØ to indicate that the
participants of an event move in one direction or another, as in (44a), in which case it
works as a sort of a directional marker, or to mark an event as consisting of distributed
actions, i.e. as discontinuous or intermittent actions, as in (44b-c):30944a. n-aya-poko-ta (R:N)
1SG-hunt-DISTR-VBLZ‘I was hunting around.’b. u-muteka-poko-ta-pe
3M-run-DISTR-VBLZ-PFTV‘He ran away, stopping here and
there.’c. u-nuta-poko-ta-i (M:51)
3M-search-DISTR-VBLZ-2O‘He is searching around for you.’5.2.1.1.1.2Causative Marking: -ka25The causative marker -ka2 is used as a valence-increasing causative morpheme
that can occur with intransitive or transitive verbs, as shown by the examples in (45),
where nhipokota is the intransitive verb for ‘to eat’ and nhika is the transitive verb for ‘to
eat’:
45a. nhi-nhipoko-ka1-ka2-ta-ru (M)
1SG-eat-INTENS-CAUS-VBLZ-3M.O‘I made him do eating.’b. nhi-nhika-nanu-ka2-ta-ru
yapa
1SG-eat-PROG-CAUS-VBLZ-3M.O capibara‘I am making him eat capibara.’This and other valence-increasing morphemes are described in syntactic contexts in
chapter 9, under 9.3.1.
5.2.1.1.1.3Intransitivizer Marking: -rewaThe intransitivizer -rewa attaches to transitive verbs making them intransitives.
So, the verbs in (46) are simple transitive verbs which inflect for subject and object
markers:5This morpheme has only been attested in the Japiim village (Paciá river).","[338, 339, 340, 341]"

possessed noun form aiko-te ‘house-POSSED’.

Independent pronouns show partial similarities in their shape to pronominal markers (see
5.1, 7.1.1 and 7.1.11-12), particularly to subject/possessor pronominal markers as compared in

such that they could be separated into distinct morphemes, as shown in the second column (from
the left) of Table 2. Although such morphemic breakings are likely to be particularly useful for a
diachronic study of these pronominal forms, or even, for that matter, in an internal reconstruction
analysis on the subject, I will refrain from further segmenting independent pronouns in the
synchronic approach taken in this work. Instead, I will describe these pronouns in Apurinã, as
shown in Table 1, as non-segmentable morphemically (though admitting that they can still be
segmented into formatives or empty morphs). To the extent that morphemes can be argued to be
part of some type of the grammatical knowledge speakers have about their language, the
assumption is that independent pronouns in Apurinã are as un-analyzable as are, for example the
English quartets me vs. I vs. my vs. mine, you vs. you vs. your vs. yours, him vs. he vs. his vs. his
in English. There is no loss in generalization in not segmenting further the independent
pronouns, unless it is one of a diachronic nature which, however, will be best described in a
diachronic investigation of independent pronouns in the language.","[377, 378, 379, 380]"
"343Another reason why descriptive verbs belong to a larger set than CNs is because
these verbs can be productively derived by the prefixing of attributive markers to other
words, as was shown under 5.3.
The fact that objective descriptive verbs share properties typologically associated
with both verbs and adjectives in some other languages suggests that to use either label in
this case may be more of an arbitrary convention than anything reflecting categorical
distinctions in the grammar.16 What the descriptive facts reveal is that property-referring
words are more “verbal-like” than “nominal-like” in Apurinã, both in terms of their forms
and behavior. Thus, in this sense, Apurinã is different from languages such as, e.g.,
Portuguese, where property-referring words share more characteristics with nouns than
with verbs.
Functions usually associated with adverbs in other languages are accomplished in
Apurinã either by adverbial particles (as will be shown in 6.3.1) or bound markers in the
verb. As we see in the next chapter, there are good reasons to treat these independent
words with adverbial functions as a subclass of particles rather than as an independent
class of adverbs. Not only is the case that the class of independent words used with
adverbial functions is rather small but, also, there is no morphological way to derive a
word with an adverbial function from another word.","[374, 375]"
"Focus Marking: -raThe focus marker -ra is used to mark focus of attention constructions, such that,
e.g., N-ra translates into English as ‘it’s N that’. Thus, noun bases or pronoun bases
marked with -ra are generally translatable into English as cleft constructions (e.g., as
illustrated for English in Givón 1990:704), as the examples in (34) show. (34a-c)
illustrate -ra with noun bases, and (34d-e) illustrate -ra with pronoun bases:
o-kama
34a. kopiti-ka4-ra
bucket-PRED-FOC 3F-make
‘It’s the bucket that she made.’
b. maku-putu-ka4-ra
n-apoka
Brazil.nut-EMPH-PRED-FOC 1SG-find
‘What I found was indeed Brazil-nut.’
c. katarokuru-nanu-ra
manioc.flour-RESTR-FOC
‘(It’s) only manioc flour...’
d. a-serota-re-kata-nanu-ra
1PL-salt-POSSED-ASSOC-RESTR-FOC
‘(It’s) only our salt...’
e. uwa-ka4-ra
3SG.M-PRED-FOC
‘It’s him!’
f. nota-ka4-ra
3SG.M-PRED-FOC
‘It’s me!’
Notice that the fact that N-ra and PRO-ra constructions in (34) (as in all other
examples of N-ra and PRO-ra constructions) translate into predicates in English does not
405necessarily mean that they constitute (verbal) predicates in Apurinã. In fact, V-ra
constructions do NOT constitute verbal predicates, although they (as any other nominal
construction) can be used as non-verbal predicates in the language (see chapter 8,
subsection 8.4.2) or be marked as predicate with the predicate marker -ka4, as in (34a-b,
e-f). N-ra and PRO-ra constructions could as well be translated with a special intonation
in a language that makes use of intonation to mark focus of attention.
When attached to verb bases, -ra functions as a focus of attention marker as well,
but to the verb. The capital letters used in the free translation of the examples in (35)
express the meaning of -ra on verbs as a marker of focus of attention:
35a. Ø-ĩketa-ra-ko
3M-get.dark-FOC-FUT
‘The NIGHT WILL COME DOWN.’

"2154.4. Noun Stem Morphology
In the previous section we have seen that nouns can be derived from verb forms.
In this section I will survey the inventory and describe the word internal distributional
and functional properties of these affixal formatives that can occur within certain bases,
here called noun stems, to form a noun. The notion of ‘noun stem’ can be understood as
the nominal unit which results from adding the bound formatives described in this section
to a root base. I will refer to the bound formatives that attach to a root base to form a
noun stem as noun stem formatives. Thus, a noun stem is a root base plus one or more
noun stem formative(s).
As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, nouns can be grammatically
defined in terms of their syntactic and morphological properties. As follows from this
definition, morphological properties which are restricted to nouns distinguish them from
other parts of speech, and, moreover, this does not mean that nouns cannot share other
properties with other parts of speech, but rather that these shared properties cannot be
used to identify a word form as a noun morphologically.
As I have already anticipated in the previous chapter (under 3.4.1.1) I will NOT
make use of the notions of inflection or derivation (or its derived terms such as
inflectional or derivational morphemes/morphology...) for the simple reason that such
notions can only be defined on a theory internal basis. I will, nevertheless, make brief
comparisons, where especially relevant, between the language internally motivated
notions of noun stem morphology and noun morphology. Noun stem morphology
consists of the properties involved in the word formation of noun stems, whereas noun
morphology consists of the properties involved in the word formation of nouns and
216absent in the word formation of noun stems. In using perhaps typologically “un-userfriendly” labels I am trying to be coherent with the decision of favoring language internal
motivated labels where these may be at odds with more common terms found in the
typological literature. It is arguable whether noun stem morphology is “simpler” in any
way than noun morphology. However, the idea is not that the morphological forms that
occur with nouns are individually more complex that the morphological forms that occur
with noun stems (though arguments could also made in this direction), but rather that the
overall structure of nouns is more complex than that of noun stems. It is in this sense that
I will argue that, at least in a naïve sense, nouns are more complex than noun stems. One
way in which these terms will also prove useful is in avoiding the biases that notions such
as derivational and inflectional morphology would bring into the analysis of the Apurinã
noun morphology.
Finally, before describing the noun stem morphology, let me repeat for
convenience the cluster of evidence that will be (heuristically) used in the identification
of formatives (i.e. morphemes, their allomorphs or empty morphs). The properties listed
in Table 26 are repeated from Table 1 of chapter 3. I will only make explicit use of these
properties where the evidence is not overwhelmingly in favor of analyzing a formative as
a morpheme, allomorph or empty morph; otherwise, their use will be made implicitly (i.e.
I will use but not mention them):217Table 26: Defining Properties of Formatives

NO4.4.1 Gender Markers: Masculine -ru1 versus Feminine -ro
All nouns, including those derived from other categories, are either masculine or
feminine for the purpose of cross-referencing marking with other elements within a
syntactic construction. Masculine and feminine gender can be marked morphologically
or they can be morphologically unmarked. Unmarked masculine/feminine gender is the
one for which no formal grammatical marker is added to the verb. There are various
ways to tell the gender of an unmarked noun form in natural discourse, all involving a
coreferential formative found in the modifier, determiner or in the predicate. This is
illustrated in the following examples in (64a) and (64b), where in the first clause tata
‘“umari”’ cross-references the feminine pronominal object form in the verb, whereas in
the second clause yowata ‘knife’ cross-references the masculine pronominal object form
in the verb:21864a. ata nhika-ro tata
we eat-3F.O umari
‘We eat “umari”.’
b. nota atama-ru
yowata
I
look-3M.O knife
‘I saw the knife.’
Different from languages such as Portuguese and French, Apurinã does not show
cross-referencing between the elements inside nominal phrases, as the possessive
constructions in (65) illustrate:20
65a. uwa
yowata-ne
3SG.M knife-POSSED
‘his knife’
b. owa
yowata-ne
3SG.F knife-POSSED
‘her knife’
Nouns that are morphologically unmarked for gender constitute the majority of
the Apurinã nominal lexicon. They include sex-non-differentiable nouns such as those
listed in Table 27. As can be gathered from Table 27, the great majority of
morphologically unmarked noun stems referring to sex-non-differentiable elements is
assigned to the masculine gender.","[246, 247, 248, 249, 250]"
"442Chapter 8Simplex Sentences
8.0. Introduction
This chapter describes both the constituency and relational properties of syntactic
expressions (i.e. NPs and NPobls) of the arguments of the verb and the various properties
of clauses and predicates found in the language. Particular attention is given to the NPs
encoding notional arguments required by the lexical meaning of the verb to show the
evidence that can be used to construe the core syntactic relations subject and object.
Chapters 3-7 have presented the internal morphological structure and the syntax of word
categories. Now it is also time to show whether it is required to make use of syntactic
notions different from the purely structural ones, and, furthermore, if such notions can be
motivated, to show what types of constructions arise when relational and constituent
syntactic properties are considered, and what their distribution in the clause is. Before
describing the relevant data and their syntactic status, a few syntactic labels need to be
introduced and properly defined.
In the previous chapters, I have used the term “clause” to refer to any construction
involving a (pro)nominal form (including bound pronominal markers) plus some
predication of it. In this and the next chapters I will continue to use clause to name any
syntactic construction containing a single predicator. So, the examples in (1a-b) are both
instances of clauses. In (1a), su-pe-ka-ko ‘go-PFTV-PRED-FUT’ is the predicator and
443nota ‘1SG’ is the argument of the verb; in (1b), sãpaka-pe-ka ‘be.tired-PFTV-PRED’ is
the predicator, and nota ‘1SG’ again is the argument of the verb:
1a. nota su-pe-ka-ko
1SG go-PFTV-PRED-FUT
‘I’ll get going.’
b. nota sãpaka-pe-ka
1SG be.tired-PFTV-PRED
‘I’m already tired.’
Furthermore, I will reserve the term sentence to name any one or more clauses
that can stand by themselves in Apurinã discourse. That is, an Apurinã sentence will
consist of a single independent clause or of an independent clause plus one (or more)
dependent (i.e. subordinate, see chapter 9, section 9.1) one(s). So, each one of the two
examples in (1) above constitutes an instance of a sentence, as well as the combination of
an independent and a dependent clause in (2):
2. nu-su-pe-ka-ko
kotxi
nu-sãpaka-pe-ka
1SG-go-PFTV-PRED-FUT SUBORD 1SG-be.tired-PFTV-PRED
‘I’ll get going because I’m already tired.’
What is of interest in this chapter are the mono-clausal sentences, as represented by the
examples in (1), rather than multi-clausal sentences, as represented by the example in (2).
In order to facilitate the presentation of mono- versus multi-clausal sentences I will refer
to the former as simplex sentences, and to the later as complex sentences. Complex
sentences will be dealt with in the next chapter. I should note that the term “simplex”
(rather than “simple”) is used here so as NOT to imply that the relevant sentences are
necessarily simpler in any trivial way than complex sentences, since it is possible for
certain simplex sentences to involve more complex structures than certain complex ones.
444In using the terms just introduced I intend to make a compromise between presenting a
description of the Apurinã syntax in terms of concepts that can be clearly motivated in
the language on the basis of its internal properties and that, at the same time, are
crosslinguistically sound.
Therefore, sentence, as it is defined in the syntax of Apurinã, is an abstract
construct that can only achieve audible realization through clause(s). What the next
sections will show is that such an abstract concept is not only useful but, also, it can be
easily motivated on the basis of the data to be described in this and the next chapter.
Moreover, such a definition of the Apurinã sentence will partly match the (perhaps) most
often cited general definitions of “sentence” found in the linguistic literature, such as the
ones represented by (3-8):
3. “The sentence is considered here not as a unit consisting of a predicate and nouns
related to it (a simple clause), but rather as a combination of such units (clauses) into still
larger structures of a sort here summarized.” (Longacre 1985:235)
4. “The sentence is the largest unit of grammatical description.” (Bloomfield, as
presented in Lyons 1968:172)
5. “As a grammatical unit, the sentence is an abstract entity in terms of which the linguist
accounts for the distributional relations holding within utterances.” (1968:176)
6. “[T]he sentence in turn can be defined as the maximal unit of syntax, or the largest
unit over which constructional relations hold.” (Matthews 1981:29)
7. The sentence is “[t]he largest unit in terms of which the grammar of a language is
organized.” (Crystal 1992:349)4458. “In generative grammar, [the sentence is] the syntactic category which is taken as the
largest category capable of syntactic characterization, all of its component parts being
bound together by rules of syntax and its entire structure being well-formed.” (Trask
1992:250-251)
However, one should also bear in mind that there are perhaps as many putative
crosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” as the number of different syntactic theories.
The definition used here follows from the properties of the Apurinã grammar as well as
(partly) from what implicitly or explicitly is found in some of those putative
crosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” (such as the ones given in 3-8). In the way
conceived here, the notion of “sentence”, as unit of syntax, is an abstract construct in a
way analogous to the way in which “phoneme”, as a unit of phonology, and “morpheme”,
as unit of morphology, also are abstract constructs.18.1. The Structure of Phrases
The goal of this section is to motivate and describe the constituent structure of
clauses. In providing evidence for parts of speech as units involved in the organization of
clauses, by implication, I have also provided motivation for treating words as constituents
of the clause. What needs to be examined now is the extent to which words can combine
into larger constituents within a clause. There is no question that words constitute
individual constituents within the clause. So, for example, in the first of the three clauses
in (9a), suto ‘woman’ occurs preceding the verb apo-pe ‘arrive-PFTV’. As shown by the1I have found particular useful the discussions in Lyons 1968:172-180 and Matthews 1981:ch.2 on the various
definitions of “sentence”, where detailed references on the subject are also provided.","[473, 474, 475, 476, 477]"
"375Chapter 7Special Bound Formatives
7.0. Introduction
Chapters 4-6 described the morphological structure of nouns, verbs and closed
word classes. In those chapters only affixes that were specific to one or the other word
class were discussed in detail. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the various types
of bound formatives that occur outside of the bound morphology described in chapters 46. The reason to describe this “outer” bound formatives separately from the “inner”
bound formatives described in the previous chapters can be summarized as follows: (i)
“Outer” bound formatives occur in positional classes located outside of the “inner” bound
formatives; (ii) some of these “outer” bound formatives can “float” in the clause,
attaching to host bases belonging to distinct word classes; and (iii) some of the “outer”
bound formatives interact in special ways with syntactic phenomena. Insofar as the
“outer” bound formatives occur in fixed positional classes, they are affix-like. However,
insofar as some of these “outer” bound formatives can attach to different host bases
and/or interact in special ways with syntactic structures, they have properties usually
attributed to separate words. It is these three properties of the “outer” bound formatives
that have led me to class them as a group of special bound formatives —to distinguish
and describe them in a chapter of their own, separately from the more typical affixes
presented in earlier chapters. Like the inherent formatives described for nouns and verbs
376in chapters 4 and 5, respectively, special bound formatives do not change the category of
the word they attach to, and, in this, sense, they are more inflection-like than derivationlike.
The organization of this chapter is as follows: Section in 7.1 will describe the
meaning/function of special bound formatives, also illustrating the category of the host
base which they attach; 7.2 will summarize the distribution of special bound formatives
both in terms of how they are placed in their host base as well as in terms of their
placement in relation to the clause. 7.3 will present a brief discussion of the category
status of special bound formatives, justifying why the label ‘special bound formatives’
rather than ‘clitics’ is used. Finally, 7.4 will illustrate some cases of other (potential)
special bound formatives that, however, still require further investigation.
Before going into the details of the description of special bound formatives, let me
repeat in (1-2) the structure of nouns and verbs presented in chapters 4 and 5,
respectively, so as to provide a general picture of the position of special bound formatives
(as a group) in noun and verb host bases:

"“Passive” Marking: -~ka
The formative -~ka, where “~” is a nasal feature that is added to the immediatelypreceding vowel in the base this marker attaches to, has been described by Pickering
(1971:17, where the formative is represented as -Ṽka) as marker of a passive verb form5.
As a ""passivizer"" marker, -~ka attaches to a verb base to make the subject encode a
“patient” role. For the present purposes, a “patient” is understood as an affected,
non-volitional semantic role. More standardized terms for semantic roles are provided in
chapter 8, under 8.3. The examples in (27) illustrate this “passivizing” function of -~ka:
27a. Ø-oka-pẽ-ka
3M-kill-PFTV-PASS
‘He was killed.’5Only recently I have been able to attest the form –Ṽ ka in the Fortaleza village. There speakers lengthen and nasalize
the vowel preceding the “passivizing” marker, cf. Ø-oka-pe-ka-ru (3M-kill-PFTV-PRED-3M.O) ‘He killed it’ and
Ø-oka-pe-ẽka (3M-kill-PFTV-PASS) ‘He was killed.’400b. n-apoka-pẽ-ka
1SG-find-PFTV-PASS
‘I have been found.’
c. u-pata-pẽ-ka
3M-cover-PFTV-PASS
‘It has been covered.’
d. uwa-nhi
ãkiti
oka-pẽ-ka
man-AFFECT jaguar kill-PFTV-PASS
‘The man was killed by the jaguar.’
The examples in (27a-c) all take the subject/possessor pronominal marker which,
however, maps onto “patient”-like (rather than onto “agent”-like semantic arguments). In
Apurinã, when the free nominal expressions that encode, respectively, “agent”-like and
“patient”-like semantic roles co-occur pre-verbally, the unmarked interpretation is that
the pre-verbal nominal free expression that occurs adjacent to the verb maps onto the
“agent”-like semantic role. The fact that in (27d), the pre-verbal nominal expression that
occurs adjacent is interpreted as mapping onto a “patient”-like semantic role also follows
from the presence of the “passive” marker in the verb.
However, examples such as the ones in (27) are scarce in text material, although
they are generally accepted by speakers. Only (27a) comes from naturally occurring
speech (in the Água Preta Village, number 5 in Fig. 2 of chapter 1). Not only that but,
also, another use of -~ka is in combination with the perfective marker -pe and, less often,
with the imperfective marker -panhi, in both cases, however, without the passive
meaning, as the next examples in (28) illustrate:6
28a. uwã u-su-pẽ-ka

7.2.1.2). In the examples in (49) the underlined elements are the pronominal markers
plus their corresponding (co-referential) subject NP. In (49a), for instance, the
pronominal marker prefixed to the verb is n-, which is co-referential with the post-verbal
independent pronoun nota for first person singular. The other examples in (49) illustrate
the same for the different grammatical persons:9

‘He/it likes her/it.’9In some speech varieties speakers hesitate or simply do not accept the use of some free subject pronominal
expressions post-verbally even if the coreferential pronominal marker is present in the verb. The reasons for this
restriction require further investigation, the restriction does not apply uniformly to all the independent pronouns. In
the Fortaleza village, for example, one speaker rejected (49c,e,g), hesitated before accepting (49f), but accepted all
other cases.","[504, 505]"
"8.5.1 Valence-Increasing Operations
In the following subsection the causative markers used in operations that result in
increased valence are first described.
8.5.1.1Causatives
As seen in 5.2.1.1.1.2, 5.2.1.1.1.5 and 5.2.1.2.1.4, there are three forms ofmorphological causatives in the language. The first causativizer is the class1 bound
verbal form -kũtaka, used with transitive verbs, and described in 5.2.1.1.1.5 above. -kũ
taka is illustrated in clausal context in (79a), where it attaches to the transitive verb nhika
‘to eat’; p-ita-ru ‘2SG-cousin.of-M’ refers to the one caused to do something (i.e. the
causee); yapa ‘“capibara”’ is what was caused to be eaten; and the subject marker arefers to the one who causes the causee to do something (i.e. the causer). nhika is a
bivalent verb, but in this example it works as a trivalent one as a result of the presence of
the causativizer: (In these and in other examples below, underlining is used just to
505highlight the causativizer, whereas double underlining indicates coreference between
double-underlined forms.)

‘Let’s make him eat “capybara”.’
The example in (79b) illustrates the fact that, in causative constructions, the
causee can be marked in the verb as the object marker. Thus, the NP-causee bears the
subject whereas the NP-causer bears the object grammatical relations. The question left
unanswered is what the grammatical relation of ‘what is caused to be V-ed’ is. In other
words: What is the grammatical relation of yapa in (79)? One possible analysis of this
third argument of causative constructions is to treat it as bearing an oblique grammatical
relation. The problem, however, of treating arguments such as yapa in (79) as an oblique
is that this argument is not structurally optional in the clause in the same way as other
obliques are in the language. Another possible analysis is to treat it as a secondary object
that is restricted to causative constructions. The problem with this second analysis is that
there is no independent evidence to treat such an argument as an object. The notion of a
grammatical object was defined for Apurinã over the possibility of a free expression cooccur with a coreferential object marker in the verb. As was shown in (79), the object
marker in the verb of causative constructions is coreferential with the causee and not with
‘what is caused to be V-ed’. Hence, either analyses have problems. In order to avoid
positing an ill motivated solution to this problem, I will choose to leave undetermined
506what the grammatical relation of ‘what is caused to be V-ed’ is in a causative
construction. I suspect that further research on the intrinsic properties of objects and
obliques in Apurinã will reveal ways that will help to resolve the issue.
The second and third causativizers have the same phonological form, -ka, and the
same function, occurring with both transitive and intransitive verbs. They only differ in
their affix position within the verb: One belongs to class1 bound verbal forms
(5.2.1.1.1.3) whereas the other belongs to class2 bound forms (5.2.1.2.1.4). In the
example in (80a) n- is the causer and amarunu ‘boy’ is the causee; in (80b) (repeated
from chapter 5), nhi- is the causer, -ru the causee, and yapa the object. In the first case a
monovalent verb is made bivalent, and in the second case a bivalent verb is made
trivalent:
O.CAUSEE s.causer-V
80a. amarunu
n-umaka-ka2-nanu-ta
boy
1SG-sleep-CAUS-PROG-VBLZ
‘I am making the kid sleep.’
causer-V-o.causee
O.CAUSEE
b. nhi-nhika-ka3-ru
yapa
1SG-eat-CAUS-3M.O capybara
‘I made him eat capybara.’
That the causee of an intransitive verb behaves as a grammatical object is shown
by the next example in (81). In this example the causee is anãpa ‘dog’ and it co-occurs
with a coreferential object pronominal marker, i.e. -ru ‘3M.O’, in the verb:
S.CAUSER V-CAUS-o.causee
O.CAUSEE
81. kuku
muteka-ka3-pe-ru
anãpa
boy
run-CAUS-PFTV-3M.O dog
‘The man made the dog run.’507Notice also that, as can be seen by comparing (80a) and (80b), the causer maps
onto subject regardless of whether the verb is transitive or intransitive. On the other
hand, as can be seen by comparing (80b) and (81), the causee is mapped onto the object
regardless of whether the verb is transitive or intransitive.
Presently, aside from the transitivity distinction there is no evidence that other
grammatical properties play a role in the decision to use one or the other of the
causativizers. This may suggest that any such a distinction, instead, comes from subtle
semantic or discourse-pragmatic properties that are not grammaticalized in the language
—and which still need to be determined. So far I have not been able to find any
grammatical or discourse-pragmatic factor that can be used to distinguish the use of -ka2
versus -ka3. The co-occurrence of -ka2 and -ka3 in the same verb base does not occur in
natural speech. Only very collaborative speakers can sometimes accept the use of two
causativizers in the same verb base. Finally, notice that, as demonstrated by (80a) when
compared to (82), whereas the causer is always the subject (since the causer can be
coreferential with or expressed as the subject pronominal marker), never the object, the
causee is always the object (since the causee can coreferential or expressed as the object
pronominal marker), never the subject:
S.CAUSEE
V-causer.o
82. *amarunu umaka-ka-nanu-ta-no
boy
eat-CAUS-PROG-VBLZ-1SG.O
(I am making the kid sleep.)
Thus, the mapping between causer and causee and the grammatical relations borne by
their syntactic expressions further confirms the subject-object distinction, insofar as the508former always maps onto the grammatical subject whereas the latter always maps onto
the grammatical object.","[536, 537, 538, 539, 540]"
"2.4. Minimal Word Requirement
Until recently, the phenomenon described in this section had been considered by
me as just a simple idiosyncrasy of the phonotactics of the language, thus not deserving a
112place in the language grammar. However, after noticing that analogous processes have
also been described for other languages, I decided to describe it here in its own
subsection. Once closer examination was taken over the phenomenon, it became obvious
that it is motivated by a constraint on the prosodic word structure briefly described in
2.3.3.3. This constraint, here called minimal word requirement, can be stated as
follows: A prosodic word can minimally consist of a bi-moraic (i.e. heavy) syllable. (A
summary of and earlier references to minimal word phenomena in other languages can be
found in Kenstowicz 1994:640-646, Hayes 1995:47-48.) The examples in (114) illustrate
the four types of minimal prosodic words allowed in the language, namely the ones
having CV1V2, V1V2, CV1V1, and V1V1 syllable templates (where the subscript numbers
are indexed to the melody of the preceding vowel):
(x)
σ
µµ
114a. [a] ‘here’(x)
σ
µµ
b. [e] ‘INTERJ’(x)
σ
µµ
c. [te] ‘seagull’(x)
σ
µµ
d. [i] ‘fat’Under 2.3.2 I have already noted that Apurinã lacks both unstressed monosyllabic
words and monophthongal words containing a short vowel. Now we can conclude that
both the absence of unstressed monosyllabic words and of monophthongs containing a
short vowel follow naturally from the minimal word requirement. That is, if a word in
Apurinã needs to have a minimal size of two moras, and if a two-mora syllable needs to
be stressed (following the rule given in (104)), then every monosyllabic word in the word
will always be stressed. On the other hand, if a monosyllabic word is necessarily bimoraic the only monophthongal words allowed in the language will be those containing113long vowels or diphthongs. The following types of prosodic word forms in (115) are,
thus, ruled out by the minimal word requirement. The word types ruled out in (115a-b)
represent the unstressed monosyllabic words, whereas the word types ruled out in (115cd) are the stressed monosyllabic words:
(.)
σ
µ(.)
σ
µ(x)

µ(x)

µ115a. *[CV]b. *[V]c. *[CV]d. *[V]The minimal word requirement can be represented as in (116), which states that a
prosodic word can consist either of a polysyllabic word form or of a bi-moraic
monosyllabic one:
116. Prosodic Word → (...)σ(...)
µ µ
The stress property of the minimal (monosyllabic) word is independently accounted for
by the rule given in (104) (for primary stress attraction to word final heavy syllable) and,
thus, need NOT be expressed as part of the minimal word requirement.
Finally, the reason to restrict the minimal word requirement to prosodic words is
that there are scarce instances of grammatical words made of monosyllables containing a
short vowel. The two grammatical words in (117) are the only attested instances of
stressed monosyllabic words (there is no attested case of unstressed monosyllabic words).
Even these words, however, when used without additional morphology (in natural
discourse contexts) tend to cliticize to the preceding word form. The cliticization
114happens in spite of such words constituting clear cases of independent grammatical (as
opposed to phonological) words (as discussed in chapter 3.2).

As the title above suggests, this section deals specifically with the phonotactic
constraints found in the language, i.e. the limitations on the distribution and combination
of sounds and sound sequences within the phonological word (Burling 1992:134,
Kenstowicz 1994:250). Some of these constraints will provide further evidence for a few
of the general phonological processes already mentioned in previous sections, helping to
determine more precisely the scope/context of occurrence for such processes. All the
phonotactic constraints described here are stated in prose, and those that follow from
phonologically or morphologically conditioned rules, are cross-referenced with the
respective section where the rule representation was provided.
The first segmental distributional constraint can be stated as in (118), and is
illustrated in (119-121):
118. /h/ only occurs word initially, except when preceded by the reduced form of the
pronoun for first person singular, [nu#], which cliticizes to the verb. (See subsection
2.1.3.5 above for the rule representation expressing the limited distribution of /h/.)

122. /ˆ/ does not occur following or preceding a palatal sound, i.e. /t, , , j/ or the high
front vowel /i/. (See subsection 2.1.3.2 above for a rule representation that partially
expresses the limited distribution of //.)The third segmental distributional restriction is as given in (123):
123. /j/ does not occur preceding /i/.","[143, 144, 145, 146, 147]"
"6.7.1Adverbial Particles
Certain particles have meanings that include time, manner, degree, spatial deixis, thussemantic properties reminiscent to certain adverbs in European languages. These particles are
here called adverbial particles, a label which will be more properly justified as some of the
distributional properties of these particles are presented below. Time (or temporal) expressions
refer to parts of a day, and to shorter or longer periods in the life of a person or group of persons.
The following table lists the adverbial particles currently attested:367Table 6: Adverbial Temporal Particles
GlossAdverbial Particles

oposo
mitxi
atana
katana
kitxaka
kutatu‘today’
‘after’
‘first, initially’

‘in ancient times’The following examples in (30) illustrate some of the adverbial temporal particles:
30a. ã-apo-pe
watxa

‘We arrived today/now.’
b. oposo u-sa-ru

first 3M-come-3M.O
‘First, he came.’
d. kuta
nu-sa-ru
yesterday 1SG-go-3M.O
‘I left yesterday.’
e. and so on.
As illustrated by watxa ‘today, now’ in the examples in (31), adverbial particles have a
“loose” distribution within the clause, with no formal marking or semantic consequences:
31a. watxa nu-su-pe-ka
today 1SG-go-PFTV-PRED
‘I’ll leave now.’
b. nu-su-pe-ka
watxa
1SG-go-PFTV-PRED today
‘I’ll leaving now.’
368There is one reasonably clear case of manner adverbial particle in the language, which
is the form arĩkika ‘slowly.’ As shown in (32), ari%kika, can occur before (32a) or after (32b) the
modified predicate:
kuku
apo-pe
32a. arĩkika sãki-rewa-ta-karu
slowly speak-INTR-VBLZ-RELZ man
arrive-PFTV
‘‘The man who speaks slowly arrived.’
b. sãki-rewa-ta-karu
kuku apo-pe
arĩkika
speak-INTR-VBLZ-RELZ man
arrive-PFTV slowly
‘‘The man who speaks arrived slowly.’
Notice in the examples above that the manner adverb, in both instances, modifies the meaning of
the predicate adjacent to it.
Some meanings that are associated with adverbs in European languages (insofar as they
refer to the intensity of an event/state, the degree to which or the manner in which it takes place)
are expressed by bound forms in the verb in Apurinã. Examples of these are –ka
‘INTENSIFIER’, -wari ‘almost’, and -ãpo ‘RANDOM’ (described under 5.2.1.1). Other
adverb-like meanings are expressed as verbal constructions, such that, in terms of their
translation equivalents, instead of saying ‘He runs rapidly.’ one would say ‘He’s fast.’
Other semantically adverb-like particles include a pair of spatial forms used with deictic
functions. Analogous to the demonstratives, these spatial adverbial forms can be distal, i.e. far
from the speaker (or other deictic center), or proximate, i.e. close to the speaker/hearer (or other
deictic center), as listed in the following Table 7:
Table 7: Adverbial Spatial Particles
Gloss
‘here’
‘there’Forms
wai
werã
369The examples in (33) illustrate the use of distal and proximate adverbial particles:
33a. n-awa-ru
wai
1SG-exist-3M.O here
‘I live here.’
b. nu-sa-ru
werã
1SG-go-3M.O there
‘He went there.’
One important information related to the approximate adverbial particle wai is that there
is a phonologically identical form that can be used as a descriptive verb. So, the conventional
way to greet a person when visiting an Apurinã village is by uttering (34a), for which (34b) is the
conventional answer:
34a. wai-ka-i
pite
be.here-PRED-2O 2SG
‘Hi there…!’
Lit.: ‘Are you here?’
b. wai-ka-ra-no
nota
be.here-PRED-FOC-2O 1SG
‘Hi, I’m here!’
Lit.: ‘It’s here that I am!’
Both in (34a) and (34b) the form wai is used as a descriptive objective verb which takes the
object pronominal marker to express its notional subject. There are two possible analyses of
these examples as far as the form wai is concerned. The basic question is whether the proximate
adverbial particle and the object descriptive verb are different words or whether they actually are
the same word, namely a proximate adverbial particle that can be used (as other words can) as
the predicate of a “verbless” clause. In this work I will treat wai used in an object descriptive
predicate as a descriptive objective verb, and wai used with an adverbial-like function as an
370adverbial particle. It is conceivable, however, that this is ultimately a purely terminological
issue.
Another terminological issue is whether adverbial particles should not be described as an
independent word class equivalent to the word class adverbs in European languages. The reason
I have included adverbials as a subclass of particles rather than as an independent word class is
that adverbs, like other particles, share the property of lacking any inherent morphological
property. Ultimately, this may be another simple matter of terminology which is immaterial to
the description of the language.","[398, 399, 400, 401, 402]"
"5.5 Where Have All the Adjectives and Adverbs
Gone?15
The functions normally associated with adjectives in other languages are
accomplished in Apurinã either by C(lassificatory)N(oun)s or by descriptive verbs. In
productive compound nouns consisting of the CN2s (described in 4.1.1.2.2) it is
particularly clear how attributive functions are accomplished in the language. CN2s are
the classificatory nouns that can be used to refer to their source (literal) meaning as well
as to target (metaphorically extended) meanings. Since CN2s occur as part of a
productive compound noun to refer only to salient physical properties of the compound’s
meaning, they end up being used fully productively with attributive functions in a manner
(functionally) similar to adjectives in other languages. So, we saw that a CN2 such as
-muna ‘trunk of’ ends up being used attached to basically any noun (as part of a
productive compound noun) to attribute the ‘cylindrical’ property to the noun. Hence, in
general terms, “X-muna” will be interpreted as “cylindrical X”, where X is any noun with
a physical/concrete reference in the world. Another example is the CN2 -ke, whose
source meaning is ‘stick of, rod of’ and whose target meaning can be described as ‘of a
thin and generally flexible consistency’. As it happens, this seemed to be precisely the
picture some Apurinã individuals had of me when I, in my early twenties, first visited one
specific community. There one of the speakers (later to become one of my major342consultants) added the form -ke to my Apurinã name (which I had been given in another
village in an earlier trip). So, instead of being called youka I was being called youka-ke,
i.e ‘skinny Youka’. It is in this way that CN2s are used (rather productively) with an
attributive function.
While classificatory nouns are a closed subset of inalienable nouns, descriptive
verbs, on the other hand, form a larger (if not an open) subset of intransitive verbs (see
5.1.1.1.2). The fact that the set of descriptive verbs is much larger than the set of
classificatory nouns follows from the lexical semantics of both categories. While the
meanings of classificatory nouns consist of very general semantic properties associated
with shapes and consistencies, those of descriptive verbs consist of a larger variety that
includes sizes (big, small, long etc.), shapes (straight, crooked, sharp etc.), qualities (new,
old, hot etc.), values (good, bad etc.) and so on. The examples in (13), repeated below as
(89), illustrate the use of descriptive verbs modifying nominal and pronominal forms as
predicators of the clause:

"Unpossessed Form

‘vegetables’
‘elder’
‘tapioca’As can be observed in Tables 3, 5 and 6, there are instances of allomorphic alternations
of the lexical base which the possessed marker -txi attaches to that are lexically conditioned.
That is, when -txi occurs with a subset of the nouns referring to body parts, a subset of nouns
referring to abstract concepts or a subset of nouns referring to other concepts, the vowel
which precedes -txi is nasalized. This is further illustrated in each of the pairs of words
given in (7-12), where the first word of each pair is the possessed form of the noun, whereas
the second word in each pair is the unpossessed form of the noun: (Bound pronominal
markers are used in the examples below for easy of illustration. As will be seen in chapter
7, section 7.1.1, these pronominal markers, when used as possessors, are in complementary
distribution with free (pro)nominal possessors.)1577a. nu-kuwu

‘tapioca’In all the pairs above, the final vowel of the base form to which -txi attaches (to mark the
noun as unpossessed) is nasalized. As can be seen from the Tables 3-6, the great majority of
the noun forms that have the vowel preceding -txi nasalized are those referring to body parts.
158The norm is for the affixation of the unpossessed marker NOT to trigger nasalization in
nouns referring to concepts other than body parts (as shown in Tables 4-6). The rule
accounting for the lexically conditioned allomorphy of the sort just described can be stated
as in (13):
13. The unpossessed suffix -txi nasalizes the preceding vowel of the base it attaches to when
this base belongs to a subclass of nouns referring to body parts or abstract concepts or a
few others;
i.e. V → Ṽ / _+txi, where V is part of a noun stem referring to body parts or bodyrelated phenomena.
Conceivably, if a lexical semantic analysis can show that the word mixĩ-txi
‘pregnancy’ refers to a concept that can be semantically categorized as a body part in
Apurinã, and if it is assumed that the word nakanhĩ-txi ‘tapioca paste’ has the vowel
preceding -txi nasalized by analogy to words such as pitxĩ-txi ‘penis’, mixĩ-txi, kuwĩ-txi
‘head’, okĩ-txi ‘eye’, etc., then the presence of the nasalization preceding -txi can be
described as restricted to a subset of body parts, with exception(s) due to developments
by analogy. Such an analysis, in order to be satisfactory, is likely to require evidence
from the internal reconstruction and/or a diachronic analysis of -txi.
Tables 4-6 also illustrated the fact that (as previously shown in Facundes 1994a
and 1995a) class membership for simple inalienable non-classificatory nouns cannot be
predicted solely on semantic grounds, and, thus, is grammatically determined. However,
it still is the case that the class of concepts expressed by the nouns marked with -txi
include those which are among the ones mostly likely to behave as inalienably possessed
in other languages: body parts, personal belongings and abstract nouns. Worth noting is
159the fact that kinship terms are entirely excluded from the subset of inalienable nouns that
can take the unpossessed marker -txi. The word kiyomanhi-txi ‘elder’ given in Table 6 is
no exception since it simply refers to a person of advanced age, regardless of his/her kin
relationships. True kin terms are never used in unpossessed contexts; that is, they are
always possessed when used in normal speech. So, in order to express a proposition such
as ‘The grandmother has arrived’, one would normally utter the sentence in (14a) or
(14b), where, since it is assumed it is somebody’s ‘grandmother’, the word for
‘grandmother’ will be expressed as possessed either by a third person masculine
pronominal form or by a third person feminine pronominal form:
14a. Ø-akuro
apo-pe
3M-grandmother.of arrive-PFTV‘His grandmother has arrived.’b. õ-akuro
apo-pe
3F-grandmother.of arrive-PFTV‘Her grandmother has arrived.’Cases where kin terms are used without a possessor formally expressed are those
where the kin term being used is a vocative, in which case the vocative is interpreted in
terms of its relationship to the speaker —that is, in such cases, the possessor is assumed
to be the speaker. (15) illustrates the use of vocatives as kin terms NOT formally marked
as possessed:
15a. kuro

grandma arrive-PFTV‘Grandma has arrived.’b. totu
