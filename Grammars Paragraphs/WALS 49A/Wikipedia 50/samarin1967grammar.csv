In the latter case the personal pronouns are light-heartedly used for inanimate objects (which otherwise have no pronominal substitutes).",[162]
"There may even becombinations of these, in which case the phrase may be very long (ex. 27).

real, since the context almost invariably clears it up.

and that in which the head is affected or effected by the complement, the
latter is often a pronoun.",[128]

The ti phrase involved may, as is shown elsewhere (q.v. 5.6i.io), indicate
possession, equation, attribution, destination, location, time, and so forth.
