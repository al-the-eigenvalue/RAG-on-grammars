"3. 7.2 Functions of the postpositions
The major meanings and functions of each postposition are set out in the
remainder of this section. No attempt is made to separate those uses which
correspond to significant functions within the language (such as Agent, Means,
Manner, etc.) from those which are identified merely on intuitive grounds, and
correspond to no systematic distinction made in the language (such as the
possessor relationship). Although it is my belief that ultimately the
meanings/functions of each postposition will be accountable for as
contextualisations of a single core or formal meaning (see section 6.1), the task
of specifying these formal meanings is beyond the scope of the present analysis,
and I do not attempt it here. In order to reduce repetition, the information is
given in abbreviated form, making reference to discussion and examples from
later sections.3.7.2.1 -ngga ERGative
This postposition marks clausal constituents in the following roles:
(a) the Agent, regardless of its person or number, in a clause of 'directed
action' - i.e. a transitive, middle or reflexive/reciprocal clause (see section
5.2.1.3 and examples therein).
(b) the Instrument in all clause types (section 5.2.2.3), regardless of
whether it is a body part or non-body part Instrument. (However, it should be
noted that body part Instruments are far more frequent than non-body part
Instruments - non-body parts are more often Means than Instruments; see page
343 below.)
I reject the view proposed in many grammars of Australian languages that the
instrumental as a distinct CASE from the ergative (see for instance, Tsunoda178'IHEWORD1981:5 5, Dixon 1980:306-307, and cf. Dixon 1980:299). In my view, the
evidence they cite demonstrates that there are two distinct clausal roles, Agent and
Instrument, NOT that there are distinct cases. Thus I do not distinguish, as do
many Australianist linguists, between syntactic and semantic, or core and
peripheral CASES (or case marking postpositions); I see these contrasts as relevant
only to clause level roles (see chapter 5 below, where I make similar, though not
identical, distinctions).(c) nominal expressions (NPs and PPs) realising circumstantial roles of
Means (section 5.2.3.3), Manner (section 5.2.3.4), Cause (section 5.2.3.6) and a
subset of the Accompaniment roles (see section 5.2.3.5) in clauses of directed
action.
(d) nominal expressions functioning as Attributes of Agents (section
5.2.4).
(e) non-finite VPs in the circumstantial role of Manner in clauses of
directed action, as in example (5-332); and in non-finite VPs functioning as
Attributes of the Actor (not necessarily an Agent) in any clause type- see
examples (5-278) and (5-279).
When it marks the Agent, the ergative postposition is optional except
when the Agent is inanimate, in which case it is obligatory (see page 319 below
for further discussion). In the other circumstances of its occurrence, its presence
is usually obligatory - there are just a handful of instances in which, on
repetition of the utterance, the ergative postposition was dropped from a
circumstantial expression involving -binyi PER- see section 3.7.2.8 below.
Not only does the ergative postposition sometimes not occur where
expected- that is, it fails to mark an Agent- but occasionally also it occurs
where it is not expected, in an intransitive clause. The second use of -ngga ERG
mentioned under (e) is one instance of this type. There are also examples in
which the Actor of an intransitive clause is marked with -ngga ERG. One such
example is
(3-83) yoowarni -ngga I yoowarni -ngga gardiya I Cherrabun Bore I
one
ERG one
ERG white:man
warangji I gamba I bambimnga -widdangi booloomani -yoo I
he:sat
water
he:pumped:it for:them cattle
DAT
'There was a white man at Cherrabun Bore, who was pumping
water for cattle.'
Exactly how such examples as this should be accounted for is not yet clear.
What seems to be a recurrent feature is that the following clause is transitive.
This suggests that the ERG postposition occurs in anticipation of the followingrosrrosmoNs179transitive clause, or alternatively, perhaps that the intransitive clause is an
interpolation. (Some other Australian languages display this phenomenon in
similar circumstances -see Haviland 1979:155 on Guugu Yimidhirr and
McGregor 1979:119 on Ngaanyatjara.) Useful as this explanation may be, it
does not account for the occurrence of the ergative on non-finite VPs in
intransitive clauses (as in example (5-278)).
Finally, let us remark on the shapes of the two locational terms
ngirndangaddingga 'this side (usually of a body of water)' and
ngooddoongaddingga 'that side (usually of a body of water)'. These are evidently
constructed from the determiners ngirnda 'this' and ngooddoo 'that', with the
addition of -ngaddingga, which might plausibly be analysed as the sequence
-ngaddi-ngga COMIT+ERG. If this is the case, at least as an historical
derivation of the above forms, this may (partly) account for the formal identity
of the Gooniyandi ergative postposition with one of the allomorphs of the
locative found in many Pama-Nyungan languages, and suggest an origin for the
former in a locative marker. (That the locative and ergative morphemes coincide
in some Australian languages (for instance, Mparntwe Arrernte - Wilkins in
preparation) attests to the plausibility of a historical derivation such as this.)
3.7 .2.2 -yoo --woo DATiveThe dative postposition -yoo- -woo marks units in both clause rank roles ((c),
(d) and (f) below), and phrase rank roles ((a), (b) and (e) below).
(a) Possessors, both alienable and inalienable- see example (4-11) below
- are marked by the dative, provided that the possessor is realised by a nominal
expression. Where the possessor is referred to by a pronominal, a distinct
oblique case form of that pronoun is used instead- see examples (3-72) to
(3-74) above.
(b) Attached to an oblique pronominal, -yoo DAT indicates that the referent
of the pronoun is someone or something who is not necessarily in possession of
an item, but has some access to it, to use it in certain ways, when that item is
for the benefit of the person or thing. Example:
(3-84) ngirndaji riwi mangaddi ngaddagi -yoo -miya
this
camp not
my
DAT ONboojoo -yoo -nyali
all
DAT REP
'This place is not only for me, it is for all of us.'yaddangi
our180Tim WORDThis is also a possible sense of the dative when attached to a nominal
expression, but the difference is formally apparent only when the dative is
attached to a pronominal.
It should be noted that the sense I am alluding to here is independent of
ownership: it could be that in some sense the speaker and his group do own the
place referred to in (3-84). But this possession is irrelevant. The contrast here is
not one of temporary vs. permanent ownership, or of present vs. future or
imminent ownership.(c) A nominal expression realising the Goal participant in a middle clause
(see section 5.2.1.3 and example (5-66)), or the Affected participant in a clause
of another transitivity type (see 5.2.2.1) is marked by -yoo DAT.
(d) Nominal expressions and non-finite clauses fulfilling the circumstantial
roles of Purpose (sections 5.2.3.7 and 5.5.2.4) and Matter (sections 5.2.3.8 and
5.5.2.4) are marked by the dative postposition.
(e) Within an NP also, the dative postposition may mark a qualifying
expression {either a nominal expression or a non-finite clause) which indicates
the purpose of the referent thing, or a respect in which some attribute holds of it
-see example (5-299).
(f) -Yoo OAT frequently, although not always, marks nominal and
adverbial expressions referring to future time (see below section 5.2.3.2).
As was the case with the ergative postposition, the dative postposition is
occasionally absent where its presence is expected. This occurs in circumstance
(b), where it marks the Goal or Affected participant. An example is (3-85)- see
also example (5-70).

'That night I went to the boss, and told him, George Rundin.'
What is common across the circumstances pertaining to the omission of both
the ERG and the OAT is that the postposition is omissible if and only if the
phrase is also cross-referenced in the verb. This certainly suggests that the
presence of the postposition may have something to do with disambiguation;
however, it will be shown below (pages 319-320) that there are insurmountable
problems with this hypothesis, and that it must be rejected.","[162, 163, 164, 165]"
"2INTRODUCTIONthe low vowel only. There are no sibilants or fricatives, v01cmg is not
distinctive, and stress has a purely delimitative function (Trubetzkoy 1969:27).
Words almost always begin with a consonant, very rarely with a consonant
cluster; the apical distinction is neutralised word initially. Word medially a fairly
large number of two member consonant clusters occur. Non-verbal roots are
nearly all disyllabic or longer and typically end in vowels. Verbal roots are
phonotactically unusual (cf. Dixon 1980: 159): a large number are monosyllabic,
and many end in consonants, occasionally consonant clusters.
Lexical words may be divided into three main classes or parts-of-speech,
each with a number of subclasses: nominals, verbals, and adverbials. These are
open classes, each with a large number of members. Pronominals constitute a
distinct closed class and distinguish three persons and two numbers. Instead of
the inclusive/exclusive distinction normally found in the first person nonsingular in Australian languages, Gooniyandi makes a restricted/unrestricted
distinction. In this system, the unrestricted pronominal refers to the speaker, the
hearer, and at least one other individual; the restricted pronominal refers either to
the speaker and the hearer, or to the speaker and one or more persons other than
the hearer. In terms of the traditional categories, the unrestricted pronominal
corresponds to first person plural (more than two) inclusive, while the restricted
pronominal corresponds to the first person dual (either inclusive or exclusive) or
the first person plural exclusive.
Noun classes are not distinguished in Gooniyandi, and nominals do not
inflect for number or case. Instead, number and case information is conveyed by
means of phrase-level enclitics, which are referred to in this book as
postpositions. There are number-marking postpositions distinguishing dual and
plural numbers, and case-marking postpositions conveying ergative, dative,
ablative, allative, locative, and other local meanings. Gooniyandi nominal
phrase marking is not split ergative (Silverstein 1976b, Dixon 1979): any NP
regardless of its person or number may be ergatively marked. The ergative
postposition is, however, optional for all phrase types in the 'transitive subject'
function. Word order in the NP is free in the sense that determiners and
adjectives may precede or follow the nominal they modify. However, the NP
may be described in terms of a fixed sequence of functions or roles that the
constituent words realise.
The verbal complex has properties characteristic of both phrases and words.
It is phrase-like in its position on the rank scale (Halliday 1961/1976): it is a
clausal constituent whose ""granddaughters"" are items of morpheme rank; it is
word-like in that it is a single distributional unit, the constituents of whichlANGUAGE TYPE3occur in a fixed order. There are two obligatory constituents in the verbal
complex: a verbal stem, which always occurs initially, and a 'classifier
complex'. This classifier complex consists of, in the following order: a tense
marking prefix, bound pronominal prefixes which cross-reference certain actants
in the clause, and a 'classifier'. The tense system distinguishes four tenses (past,
present, irrealis and future); the pronominal prefixes on the whole inflect on a
nominative-accusative pattern, and generally show the same person and number
distinctions as do the free pronominals; and the classifiers distinguish twelve
classes of processes (based on aspectual type and valence, to put it loosely). In
addition the verbal complex may have one or more of a number of optional
constituents which provide aspectual and modal qualification, and a further
system of bound pronominals referring to other ('oblique') actants. Although
these constituents occur in a fixed order, their phonemic shapes, and the
boundaries between them, are frequently obscured by morphophonemic
processes.
Spatial adverbs, indicating location and direction, are frequent in motion
(and other) clauses: compass directions are used in preference to left-right
orientation, and temporal sequence is expressed by spatial metaphor. There are
also temporal and manner adverbials.
Modality and other forms of speaker evaluation of a proposition are
encoded in free particles (marking negation, mistaken belief, retribution,
repetition, certainty, uncertainty, and so on} and enclitics (carrying meanings
like 'only', 'again', 'else', 'like', 'etcetera', and so on).
Two main types of clause, verbal and verbless, are distinguishable,
depending on whether or not there is an inherent (see page 293 below) verbal
complex. Verbal clauses show four (not two- cf. Dixon 1980:278ft) distinct
'transitivity' types: intransitive, transitive, middle and reflexive/reciprocal. These
are defined by the ""case frames"" of the inherent nominal phrase constituents.
Intransitive clauses take a single unmarked NP; transitive clauses have a phrase
which may be ergatively marked and an unmarked phrase; middle clauses have a
phrase which may be ergatively marked together with a dative phrase; and
reflexive/reciprocal clauses have a single phrase, which is optionally ergatively
marked. Verbless clauses are either attributive, identifying, or existential. As in
the majority of Australian languages, constituent order is 'free' (Dixon
1980:441), in the sense that changing it does not affect the referential or
experiential meaning (Halliday 1974:47) of a clause. Constituent order is,
however, significant in respect of the textual organisation of the clause (Halliday
1974:47) - that is, the way in which the clause is organised as a message4INTRODUCTIONbearing unit. In particular, Gooniyandi is a theme-first language.
Clause complexes consist of paratactically or hypotactically related clauses.
However, it is impossible to distinguish these two types (or any others) on
purely formal criteria. There are no morphological markers signalling the
interclausal relationships, no structural differences between constituent clauses of
clause complexes and independent clauses, and no necessary cross-clause
reference relations (see Matthiessen and Thompson forthcoming, and compare
Dixon 1980:461). The clause complex types have linguistic validity as COVERT
categories (Wharf 1945/1972: 104). There is, however, a close connection
between subordination and mood, whereby subordinate clauses always have their
verb in a marked, non-indicative mood, either subjunctive or factive.","[14, 15, 16, 17]"
"The expected forms nganyi-yidda (I-ALL) and nganyi-yoo (1-DAT) do not occur.
However, this is the only context in which the oblique form may realise the
Entity function. If there is an intervening morpheme, such as a number marking
postposition, the nominative form occurs:
(3-77) ngidi-yooddoo -yoo gamba
we(R) DU

he:will:show:it:to:us:twoFinally, the oblique form is found in what would appear to be a type of
circumstance, indicating that the Actor did the process alone, or by him/herself.
The clause may be transitive, intransitive, or reflexive/reciprocal.

If the pronominals in (3-78) and (3-80) were NP constituents it would beexpected that they might occur in construction with postpositions, indicating
their role in the clause. However, they never do (in the available examples), and
moreover they contrast with PPs such as yoowarni-ngga (one-ERG) 'by one' in
(3-81). Contrast this with (3-78) above.
(3-81) yoowarni -ngga ngoorloogla

ERG I:drank:it
'I drank it alone.'
In this respect the oblique forms resemble adverbials, and an alternative
(perhaps equally valid) parts-of-speech classification might place the nominative
pronominals in the class on nominals, and the oblique and emphatic
pronominals in the adverbial class.
The forms I have labeled emphatic are used very similarly to the 'adverbial'
function of the oblique just discussed, but seem to be somewhat stronger,
indicating that not only did the Actor act alone, or as a unified group, but
he/she/they did so for his/her/their own benefit:

3.7 Postpositions
3.7.1 Preliminary remarks
The postpositions form a small class of non-ranking form units which enter into
constituency with noun phrases, forming postpositional phrases. They are
bound, phrase-level morphemes which typically occur one per phrase, and
attached to any word in the phrase, regardless of its position or role (see section
4.2 below).
Gooniyandi has fourteen postpositions. These may be divided initially into
two groups, as shown below:TIIEWORD174Number markingCase marking

PL(ural)This classification is primarily semantic, although there is at least one
formal correlate: the number markers appear to be distributionally restricted to
nominals, whilst the case markers may also occur on adverbials (see page 140
above). The two members of the second column indicate a property of the
nominal phrase to which they are attached, namely its number- and hence their
label ""number marking"" postpositions. The postpositions in the first column,
on the other hand, do not indicate any property of quality of the referent of the
nominal phrase to which they are attached. Rather, they relate that referent to
something else. I have labeled these as ""case marking"" postpositions because
they express a range of functions that are covered by case-suffixes in many
Australian languages (we will.be returning to this point shortly, and later again
in section 42).
Most Australian languages have a set of suffixes comparable with those
laid out above for Gooniyandi (see Dixon 1980:293-301, 322-326). Most
grammars, however, classify the suffixes quite differently. It is customary to
distinguish between case suffixes and derivational suffixes. The former are
inflectional, and give rise to different forms of a single word appropriate to
different syntactic environments, while the latter are non-inflectional, and
produce new lexemes from other lexical items to which they are attached (Dixon
1980:293, 323; see also Huddleston 1984:25). In section 4.2 it is shown that
none of the morphemes listed above are inflections; it can also be demonstrated
that none are derivational suffixes.
Grammars of Australian languages usually treat the comitative, and the
number markers as derivational suffixes (Dixon 1980:324-325). It is easy toPOSTPOSIDONS175show that the number markers are not derivational: they indicate the number of
the whole phrase, not the word to which they are attached (see page 278 below).
The comitative postposition is not a derivational morpheme, since it regularly
attaches to a full NP (as in example (4-80)), and there is no evidence that the
constituent that it attaches to becomes a new lexical item. These same reasons,
show that none of the remaining postpositions are derivational suffixes.
The comitative, though not the dual and plural markers, do, it is true,
occasionally have derivational uses. But this occasional use stands in contrast
with the productive uses of this morpheme as a case marking postposition (see
section 3.7.2.9 below). It might also be noted on the one hand that the
morphemes which I have classified as stem forming suffixes ALWAYS
functional derivationally, and on the other, that -nhingi ABLlt as well as
possibly -ngga ERG and -binyi PER also on occasions form new lexical items
from the one to which they are attached.
I refer to the morphemes in the left hand column above as case marking
postpositions because they fulfil functions which are associated with case
inflections in many languages, including many Australian languages - they
indicate the function of the phrase in the unit of which it is a constituent (cf.
Dixon 1980:292). However, this should not obscure the important difference
that in Gooniyandi the case markers do not form inflectional variants of a
lexeme (see section 4.2 for further discussion of this issue).
One important consequence of this difference is that, unlike most
Australianist grammarians, I do not identify a zero-marked absolutive case,
which contrasts with the ergative. There are a number of reasons for this
descriptive strategy. Firstly, it would imply a postposition which had an
invariant zero form. Whilst it is possible to maintain such a notion, there is
simply no evidence in the language which lends support to it. (To argue this
would be tantamount to arguing that subject NPs in English were in fact
prepositional phrases with a zero preposition.) Indeed, what evidence there is
leads us to reject the idea: to maintain that there were a zero postposition would
imply that the zero marked unit were an exocentric construction; this is in fact
false. Secondly, zero marking does not signal anything in itself, but the absence
of other meanings. Thirdly, no significant semantic or syntactic generalisation
arises under the zero postposition hypothesis.
All but four of these postpositions show phonologically conditioned
allomorphic alternations, as follows:
(i) -ngga ERG. This postposition is affected by two sandhi rules. One is rule
R9, by which -ngga dissimilates to-ga following a vowel that is preceded by a1761HEWORDnasal-stop sequence (see examples on page 98 above). The other is rule R9,
which inserts an epenthetic /i/ when the root ends with the velar nasal. For
example, gooddanggooddang-ingga (diverbird-ERG) 'by the diverbird'.
(ii) {y} initial postpositions. Nine of the postpositions have an initial f y}. Inaccordance with rule R6 of section 2.4.2.3.1, this initial segment hardens to /j/
following non-continuant consonants. Few Gooniyandi nominals end in
consonants, and in most cases the form of the postposition with initial /j/ is
attested only when the nominal is a borrowing from English, or when the
postposition is attached to a verbal root with a final stop or nasal (see below).
Examples illustrating the hardening process are: Jag-joo (Jack-OAT) 'for Jack',
babligaj-jaljanggal-jiddal-jayil-jayoo!-jawoo (pub-LOC/ABJ..dALLtfALLjALL:J
ALL4) 'at/from/to the pub', goorij-jangga (hold-AB~ 'from holding', and Dayibjooddoot-jarndi (Dave-DU/PL) 'a pair/group including Dave'.
(iii) -woo DAT. The verb specific allomorph -woo of the dative postposition issubject to VR6, the effect of which is to harden the initial ( w} to /g/ when
following a non-continuant, as for instance in gaj-goo (cut-DAT) 'for cutting'
and ngarag-goo (make-DAT) 'for making'.
The -yooddoo- -yiddi allomorphy is not phonologically conditioned. The
choice seems to be a matter of speaker's preference: some speakers use the
former, while others prefer the latter. (Today at least, the two forms do not
appear to be dialectal variants associated with distinct regions.)
In addition to occurring in constituency with NPs, some postpositions also
occur in constituency with PPs, adverbials and/or non-finite clauses. The first
possibility gives rise to sequences of postpositions, since the postpositions
from each PP are typically attached to the same d-word. Only a small subset of
the sequences that COULD occur actually DO occur. The first member of any
postposition sequence must be one of -nhingi ABLI> -ngaddi COMIT, -binyi
PER, -yooddoo DU, or -yarndi PL. Of these, the number markers -yooddoo DU
and -yarndi PL can be follow~ by any other postposition (note also that they are
always flrst in a postposition sequence). The remaining three, the case markers,
may be followed by the ergative -ngga only.
Postposition sequences may also arise when a PP is embedded as a constituent of
an NP which is itself embedded in a PP. No new sequences arise in this way.","[157, 158, 159, 160, 161]"
"IPRONO.MJNALS171nominative forms, and dd in the corresponding position in the oblique forms.
This d - dd could be identified as a plural marker. This suggests that we might
identify the following non-singular 'roots':
(IR)
(lU)(2non-sg)
(3non-sg)ngiya(a)-gibi-(See also below page 212.) The final i in the nominative forms might be
regarded as epenthetic (as mentioned in section 2.2.5 above, i is the unmarked
vowel word finally), inserted so as to give the word an acceptable phonological
shape (see page 90 above). The oblique pronominal involves in each case -angi
following the number marker. In view of the shape of the corresponding
emphatic pronominals, this might be segmented into an oblique suffix -ang and
an epenthetic i (which functions to give the word a normal phonological shape).
The construction of the singular pronouns is not so regular, and it is not
possible to segment the nominative and oblique pronouns into recurrent forms.
The segmentation of the non-singular forms is suggested more as a possible
historical derivation of the forms than as a synchronic morphemic analysis. Two
of the recurrent forms (d- dd and -ang(i)) are phonotactically unusual for
morphemes (these phonotactic patterns are otherwise restricted to a few verbal
morphemes), and the forms themselves do not occur outside of the pronominal
paradigm.
The choice between nominative and oblique forms depends on the
environment in which the word occurs. The forms are in complementary
distribution. The nominative is the form that occurs in the role of Entity in NPs
(see section 4.1.2), except when it (i.e. the nominative form) would be directly
followed by a case-marking postposition other than -ngga ERG (see next
section). The oblique form is found in all other contexts within NPs. It typically
realises either the Deictic or Qualifier (see section 4.1.2), in which case it
indicates possession, both alienable (including 'temporary access' possession, as
in (3-74)) and inalienable:

Verbal encliticsClassifierr-PronominalsComplex
""Para-linguistic""Interjections
Sound effectsThe parts-of-speech are classified in the table according to four major
contrasts: (a) free vs. bound; (b) non-verbal vs. verbal; (c) linguistic vs. para-PARTS-OF-SPEECH139linguistic; and (d) open vs. closed classes. These oppositions are obviously
insufficient to distinguish the classes from one another. They do, however,
provide a useful framework for the discussion of the parts-of-speech and their
interrelations. Individual lexemes are relatively easily assigned values with
respect to these four oppositions - that is, it is relatively easy to assign them
to one of the six major divisions of the table. However, determining their class
from among the possibilities within a single box is not always so easy (except
in the case of verbal items).
Gooniyandi shows a fundamental distinction between units of the verbal
class versus units of all other classes, at each rank - morpheme, word, phrase,
and perhaps also clause (see section 5.2.1 where situation and relational clauses
are distinguished- situation clauses may be regarded as ""verbal""). Verbal units
(of rank below the clause) are more restricted in distribution than are non-verbal
units, and occur only as constituents of finite verb phrases (VPs), or within nonfinite (embedded) clauses (see section 5.5 below). As has already been
mentioned, non-verbal words and morphemes are less restricted in distribution,
and need not occur in phrases of the same class. As Table 3-1 shows, no verbal
lexical words have the property of independent occurrence; this distinguishes
them from other open class Iexemes. (If an open class lexeme is bound, it must
be a verbal.)
Similarly, closed verbal classes are readily distinguished from other closed
classes by the fact that they are restricted to occurring in VPs, and from one
another by virtue of their position within the VP (see below, 3.9.3.2). The
verbal stem-forming suffixes form a small set of morphemes which, when
suffixed to verbal lexical roots form new verbal stems, which are also g-words.
By contrast, the verbal enclitics do not form g-units with the forms to which
they are attached. They can be subclassified according as to their position in the
VP (see section 3.9.3). As the term suggests, the classifier complex (CC) can be
analysed into constituent morphemes (as per section 3.9.3.2). However, it is a
g-word, and it might reasonably be regarded as an inflectional form of the
classifier. For this reason, the constituent morphemes (which occur nowhere
else) have not been individually classified.
Non-verbal lexical items are either free or bound, and this opposition
agrees fairly well with the distinction between open and closed classes. (The
latter correlates better with the distinction between ranking and non-ranking
units- see section 3.1.1.) The three classes of bound non-verbal morphemes
are distinguished from one another by the nature of the unit they form with the
constituent to which they are attached, specifically, whether it is: a g-word, inTHE WORD140which case the morpheme is a stem forming suffix; a g-phrase, in which case
the morpheme is a postposition; or not a g-unit at all, in which case the
morpheme is an enclitic. The term ""enclitic"" is used throughout this book when
making reference to bound morphemes which do not form grammatical units
with the forms to which they are attached: they retain their grammatical
independence though they do not have distributional independence. The term
""suffix"" is reserved for those morphemes which form g-words with the forms to
which they are attached.
The two classes, nominals and adverbials are not readily distinguished on
morphological grounds. Most bound morphemes that can be attached to open
class nominals can also be attached to lexemes that we would like to classify as
adverbials. The only exceptions I am aware of are the two number marking
postpositions, -yooddoo 'dual' and -yarndi 'plural', which appear to be
distributionally restricted to nominals. Occurrence, or lack of occurrence with
these two morphemes would not, however, seem to be a useful property on
which to base the definition of a lexical class. But it does appear that this
property correlates with more significant syntagmatic properties. In realising
clausal functions, nominals must occur in NPs or PPs. Although adverbials
may occur in NPs and PPs, when realising clausal roles, they typically do not,
and for every adverbial there is some clausal role that it may realise alone. Thus,
adverbials contrast with PPs in realising circumstantial roles. For adverbials
such roles are not normally mediated through postpositions, as is necessarily the
case for nominal units. The two classes, nominals and adverbials, can thus be
distinguished by the ability or non-ability of their members to realise
circumstantial roles. It follows that adverbials are non-ranking units.
It would appear that the three lexical classes can be ranged from most
marked distributionally to least marked thus: verbal, nominal, adverbial. The
following generalisation may now be made. Words of the less marked classes
may occur as constituents of phrases of the more marked classes, but words of
the more marked classes do not have this privilege with respect to the less
marked phrasal classes (assuming that markedness corresponds in a natural way
between the word and the phrase classes). Loosely, nominals can ""function as""
verbals, and adverbials can ""function as"" verbals or nominals; but these are the
only possibilities. Open class lexical words can therefore be defined in terms of
their function in the unit next above on the rank scale, as follows:
VERBALS are those lexemes which must realise the function of Process ina VP;
NOMINALS are those which must either realise a function in an NP, or••NOMINAI.S141(less frequently) the Process in a VP; and
ADVERBIALS are those lexemes which may realise functions in clauses,
NPs, PPs or VPs.
It is convenient to identify a distinct lexical class of pronominals, eventhough the members usually occur in NPs. There are three main reasons for this:
(a) distinct forms of pronominals occur for singular vs. non-singular number
(nominals do not inflect for number); (b) for each pronominal category there are
at least three distinct phonological shapes, which may be regarded as alternate
forms of the one pronominallexeme (depending on the context of occurrence);
and (c) the distribution of pronominals differ significantly from the distribution
of nominals and other parts-of-speech - for instance, pronominals never occur
as Processes in VPs. Recognition of the pronominals as a distinct class
necessitates some fairly obvious and minor adjustments in the definitions of
nominals and adverbials.
Particles constitute a small closed class of free ""form"" words which enter
into syntagms with full clauses, modifying their propositional content.
Two classes have been set off from the others as paralinguistic. (Further
research may well uncover more classes of this type.) Paralinguistic words often
stand as utterances by themselves, constituting ""minor"" clauses: that is, clauses
that can have one constituent only (cf. section 5.4.2 below). As has been
mentioned already (section 2.1.1), many of these words are phonologicallysome even phonetically - irregular.
3.3NominalsThis class contains those words which usually occur as constituents of nominal
phrases- although they are sometimes found elsewhere (e.g. as the lexical
'head' of the finite VP), and words of other classes are frequently found within
nominal phrases. In the previous section I suggested that nominals may be
characterised by the fact that they may occur in either of these two contexts:
always as NP constituents, and potentially as lexical 'heads' of VPs. The class
so defined is open, and has a very large number of members.
There seem to be no compelling reasons to identify distinct subclasses of
adjectives and nouns. Certainly no such subclass can be distinguished on
morphological grounds, such as the ability to combine with a distinct set of
morphemes, or their occurrence with a distinct set of allomorphs of the nominal
morphemes. Furthermore, the classes of words which may realise the NP roles
of Classifier, Entity, or Qualifier (as defined in section 4.1.2.1 below) have142THE WORDmany members in common. Nearly all words which can realise the Entity role
- excepting non-nominals such as pronouns - can also realise the role
Qualifier (and may also be the lexical 'head' of a VP): in other words, words
which can be referential can also be qualifying, and may indicate qualities or
properties of things.
There are, however, a number of words which realise either of the roles,
Classifier or Qualifier, but which have not yet been encountered in the Entity
role. Examples include at least twenty words which, from the English speaker's
point of view, would be good candidates for an adjective class. They include:
colours: gooroogooroo 'black', widdgali 'blue, green', lawagimana 'white';
mental attributes: ganybili 'ashamed', yoowa 'frightened, careful', binaddi
'knowledgeable',jagarndi 'awake', nurna 'greedy';
physical qualities: gawirla 'cold', gijali 'dead', balyadi 'flat', binyidi 'hard',
jaddarndi 'sharp', damarda 'blunt', giddabingaddi 'long', yanoonggoo 'new',
thoowoorndoo 'rotten';
value judgements: joornanygadda 'good', marooloo 'valuable'.
One reason why I hesitate to set these words off as a distinct class is
because semantically similar words do occur in the Entity role, as well as in the
Classifier and Qualifier roles, and so would not be adjectives by the above
criterion. Examples include: thiwa 'red, white person (i.e. person of European
descent)'; boordbara 'hot, heat'; nyamani 'big, boss'; thigi 'short, a bit'; mooyoo
'asleep, sleep'; and thithi 'moving, motion'. It seems to me that the differences
of meaning associated with the different functions are predictable - in each of
the above the first gloss is for the word as a Qualifier or Classifier, the second,
for the word as an Entity, sometimes as a Classifier. Consequently each of the
above forms is a single word, not a pair of homophones. Furthermore, the fact
that the score or so of words listed above have not been encountered in the
Entity function appears to be semantically motivated, and given the appropriate
situation, I would expect that they could be used referentially. For example,
given that boordbara 'hot' is attested in the role of Entity in a nominal phrase
functioning as the Agent of a clause, one would expect that gawirla 'cold' could
also function as the Entity in a nominal phrase in the Gooniyandi version of
'This cold is making me stifr. At this stage of the investigation, it seems to
me, it would be premature to set these words off as a distinct subclass. To do so
would be to take the actually observed 'distribution' too seriously, to ignore the
limitations of the data, and ultimately to deny an aspect of creativity in
language.","[123, 124, 125, 126, 127]"

Verbal classifiers arc cited throughout the text in capitals (e.g. +BINDI),
and are not usually glossed. Pronominal prefixes to the classifier are glossed asXXABBREVIATIONS AND CONVENTIONSfollows: the person and number information is enclosed in brackets, and is
followed by a letter referring to the case form. Thus, (IR)N indicates the
nominative form of the first person restricted.
Function labels are given with an initial capital letter.
Example sentences normally consist of three parts: (a) Gooniyandi text; (b)
interlinear gloss; and (c) free translation.
(a) The Gooniyandi text is divided into distributional words, bounded by
spaces. Morpheme boundaries are not necessarily indicated, except for the
morphemes under discussion, or where relevant to the discussion. The first Jines
of example sentences are not punctuated. However, where relevant, suprasegmental features (e.g. tone units, salience, etc.) are indicated. Bolding indicates
that a syllable is salient.
(b) Interlinear glosses are unit by unit, each full unit distinguished in the
Gooniyandi line being glossed. Where more than one English word is required
for the gloss of a unit, the words are separated by a colon (:). For typographic
convenience, 'he' is used in the glosses instead of the more cumbersome 'he, she,
or it' (Gooniyandi does not make gender distinctions in its nominals and
pronominals).
(c) A free translation is given for each example. This is enclosed in quotes:
double quotes for translations provided by the speaker himself/herself, and single
quotes otherwise.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"
"A clause may have more than one Theme. It seems that there will always
be at least one experiential role which is thematic in a clause. In addition, there
may be optionally a thematic conjunctive element or Propositional Modifier, orTiffi TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OFTiffi CLAUSE379a Topic. There are certain ordering tendencies: textual Themes - i.e.
conjunctions - invariably precede other types of Theme; Topics precede other
types of Theme, except for textual ones; and experiential Themes tend to be the
fmal theme. However, Propositional Modifiers may occupy any position in the
thematic sequence, the placement being semantically significant (cf. section
5.4.1).
It appears to be possible for a clause to have more than one independently
thematic experiential role. Line (61) of Text I is a convincing example. The
first tone unit, which consists of two nominal phrases, has the slight rise in
pitch associated with segmented Themes. The clause would appear to be ""about""
both the speaker and the kangaroo. It is possible that clauses such as the second
one in example (5-229) above also have two experiential Themes -an ellipsed
one, yoowarni gardiya 'one white person' (which is mentioned in the preceding
clause), and an explicit one, gamba 'water'. Multiple experiential Themes also
appear to occur quite frequently when one of them is a temporal or spatial
circumstance. These are normally starting point Themes, and the co-occurring
Theme is as a rule a participant role, which the clause is 'about'. Starting-point
Themes tend to be initial, like textual Themes - see for example line (7) of
Text 2.
I have already discussed Theme in relation to information packaging. To
conclude this section I turn briefly to Theme in relation to given and new. As I
have already remarked, the Theme is most frequently chosen from the register of
what is given. However, this is not always the case, and Themes not
infrequently convey new information, especially if there is nothing given- cf.
Halliday (1967:212). Indeed, information Focus can fall on the Theme. Such a
Focus will of course be marked, and everything other than the Theme will be
given. That is, it will be presupposed that a situation occurred, or a relationship
of identity or attribution obtains with respect to the Theme. Examples include
the first clause of (5-234), and
(5-240) jaji
-wami ngabbiddayi ginharruii -yiddi -ngga I
something IND they:two:ate:it you:know DU ERG
What is it that that pair have eaten?'gardlooni nganyi -ngga I
(5-241) gardiya
white:man I:hit:him I
ERG
1t was the white man that I hit'
(5-240) presupposes that they ate something; (5-241) that the speaker hit
someone. Sentences such as these are naturally translated into English as it-THE CLAUSE380clefts. The difference is that the Theme in the English it-cleft is an unmarked
focus, whereas it is marked in the Gooniyandi versions.
A focal Theme may be singled out and made more prominent by use of a
deictic expression such as ngirndajiya (this-LOC) 'here'. For example:ngirndaji -wami ngabgoodda I
this
LOC this
IND they:eat:it
'Here, maybe this is what they eat'(S-242) ngirndaji -yaThis example is a direct quote which comes from a narrative. The speaker was
one of a pair of young men looking around the campsite of another group of
people for the food they had been gathering. The effect of the initial deictic is to
single out the referent, drawing it to the addressee's attention.
But Gooniyandi does have a means of making a Theme into the unmarked
Focus. This is effected by employing a pair of phrases to refer to the Thematic
item. One expression occurs initially, as Theme; the other, the information
Focus, occurs finally also in its unmarked position. For example, yoowooloo
'man' and boolgawoolga 'old men' in line (1) of Text 2 both refer to the same
entity. The first phrase is the Theme, the second is the unmarked Focus.
Another example is(S-243) wanyjiddi ngoddagi -ngga yoowooloo gardbini
river:roo my
ERG man
he:hit:it
jamadda I
male:kangaroo
'A river kangaroo my son killed, a male one.'
A special case of this construction occurs when the discontinuous pieces
constitute together a single phrase experientially -see, for example, (4-16)
above and line (61) of Text 1. In general, the two parts of any discontinuous
phrase occur initially and finally, as Theme and unmarked Focus. It seems that
the main function of discontinuity in Gooniyandi is to enable a single
experiential role to fulfil more than one textual role. This construction is also
functionally different from the English it-cleft, which likewise has the effect of
making the Theme the unmarked Focus. This is because the material between
the Theme and the Focus in the Gooniyandi construction is unmarked for the
values given/new (see page 371 above). But the Theme must be new (since it is
at the same time focal), and it follows that everything following the ThemeTHE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE381must also be new. 6 This means that the clause involves no presupposition. This
is the case in the examples cited. By contrast, it-clefts in English involve
presuppositions. For further discussion of this pattern, see McGregor (1989).
Instead of occurring at different ends of a clause, a pair of phrases referring
to the same thematic item may be juxtaposed, to form a type of complex
Theme. Presumably the juxtaposed phrases may be logically related in any one
of the ways mentioned in section 4.3.1. Of particular interest is the case in
which the relationship is one of identification, whereby one phrase, usually the
first, identifies the second (cf. also section 5.2.1.1.1 above). The identifying
phrase is typically the information Focus of the clause, and following material
is of course given. That is, it is given (and presupposed) that the situation
obtained for a certain entity (time, place, or whatever), and that that entity (or
whatever) is identified by a different designation. Reference to the entity in the
given part of the communication is frequently by means of a determiner. In this
case, the construction is roughly equivalent to the English 'x is the one that
did/is y'; and the determiner in the Gooniyandi version does roughly the job of
the indefinite 'one' in the English version. Examples are line (12) of Text 2, and
(5-244) ngooddoo -ngga niyaji -ngga doownga
that
ERG this
ERG he:took:it
'That is the one who took it'
The following is a possible example of the opposite order, the Identifier
following the Identified:
ngirndaji -ngga I ngooddoo
(5-245) niyi -ngga gardbini
that ERG he:hit:him this
ERG
that
yaanya gijali I
other dead
The one who killed the other dead person is this one.'
Note that here the two coreferential phrases are not juxtaposed; in contrast to the
pattern discussed above for discontinuity in the preceding paragraph, the Theme
here is given.","[362, 363, 364, 365]"
"1HEWORD168If the additional feature [+singular] is invoked, it is possible to distinguish
and characterise all of the pronominal categories, as shown in Table 3-4, which
cites the nominative forms.

++The bracketed symbols of the bottom line indicate that number specification is
redundant for the non-third person categories. However, that number is relevant
to, or inherent in, these categories is evident from the fact that when the nonsingulars occur in the Entity role in NPs, it can be, but need not necessarily be
marked more precisely by number words, or by the postpositions -yooddoo DU
and -yarndi PL.
The feature analysis of Table 3-4 specifies each pronoun in such a way as
to distinguish it from every other pronoun, and associates with each an
underlying meaning specified in terms of features. This neatly encapsulates the
referential meaning of the two non-singular first person pronouns ngidi and
yaadi, providing a formal statement of the verbal description given earlier.
However, it should be noted that this does no more than provide a formal
summary of the earlier verbal statement. We must raise the question as to
whether the proposed analysis has any independent linguistic validity, and/or
whether any linguistic evidence might be invoked in support of it. The answer
to this would seem to be almost certainly NO: it is difficult to see how any
linguistic evidence might be relevant to the analysis. A more important problem
with the analysis, however, relates to the fact that the proposed features are
purely referential, and so cannot account for the avoidance usage of yaadi, in
place of ngidi, in reference to the speaker-hearer dyad, and of bidi 'they' in place
of niyi 'he, she, it', in reference to a single individual (see section 1.5 above).
As an alternative means of description, we might attempt to arrange the
Gooniyandi pronouns in a two dimensional paradigmatic set of the usual sort.
Something of this sort has already been implied by my reference to yaadi and
ngidi as first person categories in opposition to one another, the former beingPRONOMINALS169labeled unrestricted, and the latter, restricted. This implies an arrangement of the
pronominals as follows:
1sg
nganyi2
3nginyji
niyinon-sg
R ngidi
u yaadi
gidi
bidiAn alternative analysis might not take the + values for S in Table 3-4 as
defining the category of first person, but instead distinguish yaadi from all other
pronominals by virtue of the fact that it alone has a+ value for each of S, H and
0. The pronominals could then be arranged as follows:
12
3
1/2/3sg
nganyi
nginyji
niyinon-sg
ngidi
gidi
bidi
yaadiThe advantage of the paradigmatic approach is that it does not use strictly
referential features, and so does not suffer from the problems in avoidance usage,
inherent in the earlier analysis. However, there seem to be no strong arguments
for one paradigmatic arrangement over the other (see also McGregor forthcoming-c), and I have arbitrarily chosen to view yaadi as a first person form.
It will be clear that at least three individuals must be included in the
referent set of yaadi 'we unrestricted'. I have heard only the plural marker -yarndi
in construction with yaadi 'we unrestricted' in natural and elicited Gooniyandi
speech. However, when I constructed the d-word yaadi-yooddoo (first person
unrestricted-DU), it was not rejected outright, but speakers suggested that it
might refer to just three of us, the speaker, the hearer, and one other person.
(Alan Rumsey elicited a similar response to the corresponding constructed form
in Bunuba (pers.comm.).) This might be taken to suggest that -yooddoo marks
'plus one' or unit augmented (McKay 1978) rather than 'dual', were it not for the
fact that speakers themselves frequently use yaadi-yarndi (first person
unrestricted-PL) in reference to this particular group of three.
I have already mentioned (section 1.5 and immediately above) shifts in the
pronominal categories in avoidance contexts, whereby non-singular forms are
used in reference to and in addressing a single avoidance kinsman. Reference to
the speaker and a single hearer (where the two are in an avoidance relation to oneTHE WORD170another) is by means of the unrestricted yaadi, instead of the usual and predicted
restricted ngidi. One might predict that in such circumstances the dual
postposition could be used to mark the number: i.e. yaadi-yooddoo (we
unrestricted-DU) in reference to an S and a H in an avoidance relation. There are,
however, no supporting examples for this possibility.
Corresponding to each person-number combination distinguished in the
language, there are three distinct free-standing pronouns, which I will regard as
alternate forms of a single lexeme. I will refer to the forms as nominative,
oblique and emphatic; they are tabulated in Table 3-5.

the forms shown in the table above.
The emphatic forms are obviously based on the corresponding oblique
forms: a segment -jinga is added to a truncated version of the oblique
pronominal. For the non-singulars, the final vowel is deleted; for the singulars,
the final vowel and preceding consonant are deleted; and for the third person
singular, the velar nasal is inserted preceding -jinga.
Secondly, the non-singulars show d in the second syllable of the
4 Although the third person singular nominative form is homophonous with the
determiner niyi 'that' (see 3.3.1.1), that they are indeed two distinct words is
evident from the fact that the latter does not have a distinct oblique form
nhoowoo, as does the pronominal; nor does it contrast with the non-singular
pronominal bidi 'they'.","[152, 153, 154, 155]"
"•
NOMINALS143It is, however, possible to distinguish some subclasses, nearly all of whichhave a limited number of members: determiners (3.3.1), kin-terms (3.3.2),
subsection terms (3.3.3), number words (3.3.4} and proper nouns (3.3.5). These
are semantically homogeneous subclasses, and they often have distinctive
distributions within the NP, and/or with respect to certain stem-forming
suffixes.
For the remainder of the nominal class I have been unable to identify
subclasses showing distinctive formal and semantic properties. The class of
nominals includes, in addition to the subclasses mentioned in the preceding
paragraph: words for concrete objects such as flora {types of plants and trees),
fauna (various animal species), humans (including sex and age specific terms),
and their parts ('root', 'tail', 'feather', 'eye', etc.); features of the weather and the
elements (including 'fire', 'water', 'rain', 'wind', etc.); topographical and
environmental features (such as 'rock', 'creek', 'hill', 'limestone', etc.); and
artefacts ('spear', 'boomerang', etc.). Also included are more abstract words for
songs, rituals, colours, shapes, sizes, feelings ('shame', 'fear', 'anger', etc.), and
just a few terms for the most common action types ('sleep', 'motion', 'travel' (or
'walkabout') and 'fight').
3.3.1 Determinersoeterminers constitute a small closed class of nominal words which normally
realise the function Deictic in the NP (see 4.L2 for a discussion of this term).
To be precise, determiners may be defined as those words which may realise the
NP roles of Deictic, Qualifier and Entity, but not the Quantifier or Classifier
roles. This formulation of the definition is necessary in order to exclude from the
class, words such as yoowarni 'one', garndiwangooddoo 'many', etc. which may
also realise the role of Deictic (but which are not determiners semantically).
Being closed, the class of determiners could be defined by listing its members;
however, it is useful to have this independent 'distributional' justification which
shows that it is not just an arbitrary collection, set up by the analyst in the
absence of good reasons.
Determiners may be assigned to one of two categories: definite and
indefinite.
3.3.1.1 Definite determinersDefinite determiners are of three types: (1) demonstratives, which point to
something in the situational context of the utterance; (2) endophors, which referTIIEWORD144to entities mentioned in the linguistic context -usually in the preceding text,
but sometimes in the following text; and (3) a non-demonstrative, nonendophoric determiner which identifies an entity which is, or need be in neither
the linguistic nor the situational context.
[1] Demonstrative determiners distinguish two degrees of distance with respect tothe speaker, proximal and distal:
Proximal:
Distal:ngirndaji
ngooddoo'this'
'that'Both of these terms are used in reference to places as well as things (although
not, it appears, in reference to times).
There is a third term, ngirnda, which also refers to an object in the
proximity of the speech situation. But it is not clear precisely how this term
differs in meaning and function from ngirndaji 'this'. In quite a number of
examples ngirnda was used in reference to something closer to the speaker than
to the hearer, particularly when the object was invisible to the hearer. For
example, it was used in reference to an object concealed in the speaker's hand
(which the hearer believed was elsewhere) (see example (6-57)); and in another
instance it occurred in a direct quote in a text, the purpose of which was to draw
the attention of the addressee to a dead body the speaker had found. To the best of
my knowledge, there are no examples in which ngirnda is used in reference to
something relatively closer to the hearer, and/or visible to the hearer and not the
speaker. The functions of the determiner ngirnda require further investigation.
[2] There are two endophoric determiners which are usually used in anaphoric
reference to a previously mentioned entity. They are:
niyaji 'this'
niyi 'that'
(Niyi 'that' is homophonous with the third person singular pronoun, but can be
distinguished from the latter on morphological, as well as functional grounds
(see section 3.6). However, it is often difficult to be certain that a particular
instance of niyi is the determiner or the pronoun.)
The difference in meaning between these two words is not perfectly clear,
but seems to be roughly as follows. Niyaji is frequently used in reference to
something which was mentioned in the immediately preceding text, often the
immediately previous clause, and which is assumed to be in the forefront of the
hearer's consciousness. It is frequently used in the ""reprise"" construction (see
section 5.3.2), illustrated in example (3-12) below. Niyi, on the other hand,•NO:MINALS145often 'picks up' a referent established earlier in the text, but which has not been
in the foreground for some time. For example, in a text about Pigeon (the so
called ""outlaw of the Leopolds"" -see 1.6 above), reference is made to an
Aboriginal police tracker by the phrase niyi-ngga yoowooloo-ngga Roebourne
Mick-ngga (that-ERG man-ERG Roebourne Mick-ERG) 'by that man
Roebourne Mick'. This person, who had been introduced ten clauses earlier, had
played no significant role in the events described in the eight intermediate
clauses. (See also line (42) of Text 1.) However niyi is sometimes used in
reference to an entity fore grounded in a text, or one which may be assumed to be
in the forefront of the hearer's consciousness. In this case it has an emphatic or
contrastive effect- see for example (6-30) below, and line (81) of Text 1. The
difference between the two terms thus seems likely to lie in the relative
prominence they give to the referent item, rather than in the proximity of the
anaphor within the text.
In addition to referring to previously mentioned things, the two determiners
niyaji 'this' and niyi 'that' are used in making reference to portions of text of size
larger than phrases - that is, to situations, and not just entities. For instance,
in
(3-ll) garingi ngangjayi
niyaji wila
wife
he:might:have:given:him this
OK
'Had he given him (his daughter) as a wife, it would have been OK.'niyaji 'this' refers to the whole clause garingi ngangjayi 'he might have given
him a wife'. More accurately, it refers to a FACT (Halliday 1985:227), the
situation referred to by the clause (see 5.2.1), rather than the actual wording of
the clause. But the section of text may be larger than a clause. For example,
niyinhingi (that-ABL) and niyaji-nhingi (this-ABL) are used as sentential
connectives, with the approximate meaning 'then, after that', where the thing
referred to is either a single event (referred to by a sentence), or an episode
(referred to by a larger stretch of text. (fhere appear to be individual preferences,
some speakers preferring and almost always using niyinhingi 'after that'; others
prefer niyajinhingi 'after this'.) None of the other definite determiners may be
used in this way: they always refer to material entities or places.
[3] The determiner ginharndi, which is normally glossed 'you know' or 'that one,
you know' by speakers, refers to something which is neither in the immediate
speech situation, nor mentioned in the surrounding text. It indicates that, in the
speaker's estimation, the hearer is able to identify the entity being referred to, it
being known to him or her. The fact that it is explicitly stated as being shared1461HEWORDknowledge is the only clue that is given to the hearer to help him/her identify it.
(I'he neighbouring Jaru language also has a determiner jangu with a very similar
meaning- Tsunoda 1981:63.)
The two most frequent uses of ginharndi in my corpus are (i) in reference
to individuals with whom both my Gooniyandi teacher and I myself had shared
some experience (e.g. a visit), and (ii) in reference to individuals spoken about in
previous conversations. For example, {3-12) illustrates the first usage:
(3-12) ngooddoo -ngga NPfginharndi goomboo]NP wardgilayi

with:us Mulunja
ALL this
ERG she:retumed:me
gaddwaroo
afternoon
'The woman who went to Mulurrja with us brought me back
yesterday.'
It should be noted that ginharndi is not a definite article, and has a range of
uses quite distinct from the English article the. Ginharndi marks the referent of
an NP as identifiable, and so definite; but only a small subset of definite NPs
may be so marked. As distinct from the English definite article, ginharndi
indicates a specific characteristic by which the referent may be identified: it must
belong to the register of entities known, but not present in the linguistic or nonlinguistic situation. (Compare Halliday and Hasan 1976:71.)
3.3.1.2 Indefinite determinersThere are three indefinite determiners, which indicate that the identity of the
referent of the NP is not known to the speaker. They frequently carry the added
nuance of requesting this information from the hearer: that is, they are often used
with interrogative effect (cf. Dixon 1972:182ff). However, it is clear that this
interrogative sense is not a part of the fonnal meaning of the words (section
6.1), but is engendered or suggested by the context of its occurrence (see also
sections 5.4 and 5.3.1 below). This follows from the fact that there are contexts
of occurrence of these determiners (namely when they occur with the enclitics
-ngaddaya 'also, too' (section 6.3.5) and -widdi 'identity unknown' (section
6.3.6)), which do not admit interrogative interpretations. The three indefinite
determiners are:•NOMlNAI.Sngoorndoo

"···PARTS-OF-SPEECH137be able to occur in most of the environments in which yoowooloo 'man' occurs,
and certainly always in the first two. Restrictions are generally attributable to
semantic and cultural factors. For example, many words that are notionally
nouns have not been encountered in contexts like (3-9); the reason for this is
obvious: people don't normally address ants, water, trees, etc.. But these are
semantic (or pragmatic), and not grammatical restrictions, and it is easy to
invent contexts in which addressing ants or trees would not seem too unnatural
-in fact, I have a short piece of text in which the speaker addresses a particular
tree of mythical significance. On the other hand, there are lexical roots that occur
only in a subset of these environments, not including the first two, and yet other
lexemes occurring in complementary environments. Thus, even though lexemes
are multifunctional, it is possible to identify classes by occurrence in common
ranges of syntagmatic environments.
In these respects Gooniyandi would appear to be intermediate between
English and what is reportedly the norm for Australian languages. According to
Dixon (1980:271), in the majority of Australian languages lexical roots belong
to disjoint classes which are defined by occurrence in specified syntagmatic
environments. In Gooniyandi, classes defined in this way overlap considerably:
as in English, as we have seen, a single word-form can usually occur in a variety
of syntagmatic contexts. But Gooniyandi is unlike English which has a large
number of pairs like dog (noun) vs. dog (verb), bottle (noun) vs. bottle (verb),
etc., where the meaning differences are not fully predictable, thus making it
necessary for the dictionary maker to provide separate definitions for each distinct
context of occurrence. In Gooniyandi the differences of meaning are as a rule
completely predictable, and one dictionary definition will suffice.
This is not to deny the existence of homophony in Gooniyandi. As far as I
have been able to determine, however, there are very few homophones. The only
convincing examples I have been able to find are doowa 'store' and doowa 'he
gets it'; and nginyji 'you', nginyji 'certainly, indeed' and -nginyji, a form of the
classifier +DI which refers to the action of a first person singular agent on a
second person singular patient (see below section 3.9.3.2).
Most examples which at first appear to be homophones turn out on closer
examination to be single lexemes whose variant senses can be explained as
contextualisations of a single basic meaning. Consider, for example, widdijwhich translates both 'dig (a hole)' and 'scratch'; yiniga which translates as both
'how, in what manner' and 'say or do something'; miga which translates 'that
way' and 'tell, say, think'; and yiganyi which corresponds sometimes to 'maybe,
perhaps' and sometimes to 'sneakingly'. For each of these four phonemic forms IiI

~THE WORD138have given two or three approximate English glosses. based on the native
speakers' glosses in various examples. Across a large number of examples
(consisting of Gooniyandi-English translation ""equivalents"") the glosses given
for the words fall into the two or three distinct English expressions as indicated
above. It seems likely, however, that these senses are not as unrelated as the
glosses would immediately suggest to the English speaker, and that each form is
a single Iexeme having a single basic meaning. Very approximately, widdijmeans 'scrape a surface with a relatively sharp or elongated instrument'; yiniga
means 'what or some manner of action'; miga means 'this manner of action'; and
yiganyi means 'uncertain, unsure' (where cultural factors determine what
constitutes lack of assurance).

"3.9.3.6 Oblique bound pronominals
The oblique bound pronominals are encliticised forms of the oblique 'case' forms
of the personal pronominals (discussed in section 3.6 above). They refer to
Affected participants in most clause types, and to the Goal in Middle clauses (see
section 5.2.1.3 for details and examples). These pronominals are obligatory in
VPs in all Middle clauses, and in all clauses with Affected participants. They are
given in Table 3-13 (compare Table 3-6).

(i) As an inspection of this table will reveal, the final syllable of the first person
singular form may (optionally) be elided: both wardbiringaddagi and
wardbiringadda (go-FUT/(2sg)N/I-(lsg)O) 'come to me' occur, apparently in free
variation.(ii) The third person non-singular has the invariant form /widdangi/. Since this
enclitic always follows a vowel, and bears initial stress, it could be written
morphophonemically as either (widdangi} or (biddangi). the latter being the
phonological form of the corresponding free pronominal. I will, however,
represent it here in the least abstract way, as ( widdangi}.
(iii) The third person singular enclitic shows slightly more divergence than do
the other enclitics from its corresponding free form pronominal, nhoowoo. In
addition to the monosyllabic {nhi}, I have postulated a second (and unusual)
allommph, {wanhi). The reason for this is to explain a range of forms involving
the classifiers +I. +DI and +MI in the non-past tenses, where the allomorphsTHE VERB PHRASE225{ad, {dad, and {mad occur. Consider forms such as the following:
/wardbiraanhi/ (go-FUT/(2sg)N/I-(3sg)O) 'go up to him' and /jagjawilimaanhi/
(speak-SUBJ-FUT+(lsg)N+MI-(3sg)O) 'I'll speak to him'. Preceding the other
oblique pronominals, the final vowel of the CC is the expected one, namely /i/
- cf. /wardbiriwiddangi/ (go-FUT/(2sg)N/I-(3pl)O) 'go up to them', and
/jagjawilimiwiddangi/ (speak-SUBJ -FUT+(1 sg)N+Ml-(3pl)O) 'I'll speak to
them'. The easiest way of accounting for these alternations would seem to be to
assume that the third person singular pronominal has the allomorph {wanhi}
when it follows {at}; then the long vowel/aa/ (as in the examples above) would
be derived by VR5.
There is a further, exceptional, pronominal enclitic, -ngangi, not shown in
the table. This pronominal is infrequently used in reference to the speaker-hearer
dyad - i.e. it is a dual inclusive form of the first person -in either an Affected
or Goal function (regardless of clause type). When referring to the Goal in a
transitive clause -ngangi further qualifies the reference of the Accusative
pronominal in the CC (see above 3.9.3.2.2), much in the manner of a number
enclitic. For example, in /milayinangangi/ (see-(IR)N+A-(ldl)O) 'he saw me and
you', the Goal is referred to in the CC by the ACC prefix +jin+ (lR)A, and byngangi in addition. The latter restricts the possible reference of the former to just
the speaker and the hearer. Here, -ngangi is in complementary distribution with
the dual number enclitic, which may refer only to a first person dual exclusive
participant (see next section). Elsewhere -ngangi occurs in place of -ngiddangi.
These two morphemes are not, however, in complementary distribution; they
occur in contrastive variation. Both wardjingangi (go-(3sg)N+I-(ldi)O) 'he came
up to me and you' and wardjingiddangi (go-(3sg)N+I-(1R)O) 'he came up to us
(R)' occur, and the former is more explicit in its reference than the latter.
-Ngangi has not been encountered followed by a number enclitic, nor in
sequence with one of the oblique pronominals, so it is. not perfectly clear to
which order-class it belongs (or whether an additional one should be set up).
3.9.3.7 Number encliticsA single number marking enclitic, specifying either 'dual' (indicating two), or
'paucal' (indicating a few), can optionally occur in final position of any VP in
which at least one bound pronominal (either a prefix to the CC or an oblique
enclitic) is of non-singular number. This pronominal can modify ANY ONE of
the up to three non-singular pronominals that may occur in a finite VP. In case
there is more than one such non-singular category, the question immediately2261HEWORDarises as to which one the number enclitic applies to. I am unable to provide a ·
categorical answer to this question. Moreover, I doubt seriously whether there is
one: it seems likely that an answer will only be possible if discourse factors are
taken into account.
The general statement made in the previous paragraph requires some
qualification. Non-singular categories of the second and third person may be
modified by either the dual or the paucal enclitic. But in the first person nonsingular things are a little more complicated. As might be expected, the dual
will not (normally) apply to the unrestricted category (and there are no such
examples), to which only the paucal can apply. Both the dual and the paucal
may modify the first person restricted category, but the dual is used only in
reference to a pair one of which is the speaker, and the other is a third person
(and never the hearer). If the restricted category refers to the speaker and hearer
pair, it cannot be modified by the dual enclitic. That is, a form such as
milayiddayi (see-(lR)N+A-du) can only mean 'we two (exclusive of the hearer)
saw him'; it cannot mean 'we two (including the hearer) saw him'. (As
mentioned in the previous section, the irregular form -ngangi 'we two inclusive'
could be used in place of -yi, and refer to the speaker and hearer pair; but this
only when they fill the roles of Goal or Affected. -Ngangi may not be used in a
VP with a meaning such as 'we two inclusive saw him'.)
The number enclitics have the following allomorphs:
-yi ~ -yoo
-ddi- -ddoo - -waddi'dual' (du)
'paucal' (pa)The first allomorph in each case seems to be the most frequent variant,
occurring following /i/ or /a/, while the second allomorph usually follows /oo/.
Some examples are: ward-biddi-yi (go-(3pl)N+I-du) 'they went', ward-gooddooyoo (go-PRES+(3pi)N+A-du) 'they (two) go', ngab-jidda-yi (eat-(lR)N+A-du)
'we two (exclusive) ate', mila-winbidda-ddi (see-FUT+(lsg)N+(3pl)A+A-pa)
'they (few) will see me'. miga-limi-widdangi-yi (say-(lsg)N+MI-(3pl)O-du) 'I
told them two', miga-winmi-ngaddagi-yi (say-(3pl)N+MI-(Isg)O-du) 'they two
told me'.
The third allomorph of the paucal number enclitic, -waddi, occurs in
exactly the same circumstances as does the allomorph -wanhi of the third person
singular oblique bound pronominal, namely in the environment of non-past
tense forms of the classifiers +I, +DI and +MI- i.e. following {a 1 ). Examples:

The structure of the VP may be summarised in the following terms. The VP
consists of two obligatory grammatical words, which are mutually bound to, and
modify, one another, and which occur in a fixed order. This order reflects a
progression from specific to general, in terms of the lexical content, and at the
same time, somewhat paradoxically, a progression from the item that is least
specific and individuating in terms of pinning down the process to the referent
world, to the most specific and individuating, the item which refers to the actual
occurrence of the process. The position of enclitics in the VP is now explicable.
Aspect and Mood are ways of viewing the Process or predicate itself, as a whole;
they are not concerned with the actual fact of the occurrence of the Process. For
example, the progressive is concerned with the occurrence of a train of events
leading up to the culmination of the process, rather than to a process emerging
into instantiation; repetition (realised by -nyali REP) refers to repetition of a
Process, with or without the same participants, not to the repetition of an
instantiation of a process. On the other hand, the categories labelled Mode
concern the occurrence and actualisation of a process; it is the enactment of the
process that is seen as desirable, definite, or potential. Enclitics attach to the gwords on which their primary focus falls: the lexical stem in the case of
Aspectual and Mood markers, and the CC in case of Mode, pronominal and
number markers.","[209, 210, 211, 212]"
"Here nyiddi 'spinifex' does not invoke a contrast with something else that was
thrown onto the boughshade. However, it does contrast with other things that
were acted on in appropriate ways in the process of constructing the boughshade.
The spinifex may be seen as one of a succession of materials used in the
construction.
In the above examples, there has always been a definite antecedent for the
-rni SEQ constituent, established somewhere in the text. This need not be the
case. (6-30) uses a more general sense of 'next' -the hearer is warned that he'll
be the next casualty on the road (none had been specifically mentioned
previously):nginyji -rni

'Look out for that car or it will hit you next.'
6.3.2 -nyali REPThis enclitic has the widest, and from an English perspective, the most unusual
range of meanings of all the enclitics. -Nyali REP may be encliticised to
nominals (including nouns, pronouns, and demonstratives), adverbials, and
verbals, but it cannot go onto the inflected part of the verb phrase, the classifier
complex. It is normally the final element of a distributional word. For example,
where the nominal occurs in syntagm with a postposition, -nyali REP always460TOPICS IN SEMANTICSfollows the postposition. The only exception occurs in the VP, where -nyali
REP almost always appears as an infix between the verbal stem and the
following classifier complex.
In this section I will first describe its range of meanings, and then go on to
suggest that these all relate to a single formal meaning, which I will attempt to
formalise. In delimiting this range of meanings I do not mean to suggest that
they are all formally distinguishable, or that they are necessarily valid for native
speakers. Some, however, have formal correlates relating to scope, and these
may be assumed to be identified with some justification. It is important to note
that the glosses given below cannot be taken at their face value, and only
PARTICULAR CONTEXTUALISATIONS of them are applicable. For each gloss an
explanation is given which attempts to identify the value of the English word.
No implications should be drawn from the glosses as to further senses of the
Gooniyandi morpheme.
(i) 'again'. As McConvell (1983a) points out, the English word again has twodistinct senses: repetition of an action or fact, or return to a former position or
state. (He shows that these senses are related- see page 468 below.) -Nyali
REP also occurs in both of these senses. (6-31) involves repetition of the full
situation, but in (6-32) there is just a return to a former position; there is no
implication that the bird had previously swooped up.

"TilE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OFTIIE ClAUSE375The significance of the conttast between rising and falling contours is unclear.
However, the falling intonation seems to be associated with a Theme that is not
initial in the sentence, as is the case in (5-231)- cf. Kilham (1977:89).
Qualifying material may be interpolated (on its own intonation contour)
between a segmented Theme and the remainder of the clause. Such interpolated
material always occurs on a secondary and falling tone unit. An example is(5-232) maja I babligaj -joo maja I az
alex scott I
boss
pub
OAT boss
ah
migami -ngadda I
he:told to:me
'The boss, the publican, Alex Scott, he told me.'
Following Grimes (1975) I will use the term REPRISE in reference to the
pattern in which a Theme is segmented and placed in its own information unit,
and, which in addition, is referred to (usually) by one of the endophoric
determiners niyaji 'this' and niyi 'that'. In this construction, the endophoric
determiner always occurs initially in the second primary information unit. For
example,(5-233) wajaddi -nhingi mawoolyi jirliwa -jangi I niyaji
boab
ABL
Iittle:bits sinew
SEM this
widgoodda birdi -ya I
they:rub:it leg
LOC
'The fibres from the boab tree they rub on their legs (to make
twine).'
As this example shows, reprise is normally used when the Theme is longer than
usual (NPs of three words are rare). Compare(5-234) az . . . ngoorndoo yoowooloo niyi I wamba I

In fact, thematic reprise most frequently occurs in order to summarise full
clauses, as in line (75) of Text 1. (See section 5.6.2.2.2 below for further
discussion.)
Occasionally the usual ThemeARheme order appears to be reversed, with
what would appear to be the Rheme followed by what would appear to be the
Theme. In these circumstances, the apparent Theme always occurs on its own
information unit, as in the following examples:
(5-235) booroowanbiddi laandi I yaddbanyi yoowooloo I
they:were:hiding up
initiate
man
'They were hiding up, the initiates.'
(5-236) widdijjidda -nhi
banda ·wila I garndiwangooddoo -ngga I
we:dug:it on:him ground finish many
ERG
stockmen joorloo I
too
We dug a hole for him, everyone, the stockmen too.'
I will refer to this construction as TAGGING, following Grimes (1975). Tagging
normally serves the function of reminding the hearer of the identity of the
Theme or of making its identity explicit, in case there is a chance of ambiguity.
In either case, the tagged phrase typically refers to something already mentioned
in the text, or present in the extralinguistic context. This is the case for the two
immediately preceding examples. The tagged unit serves a function of
clarification or explication.
The tagging construction does not, I claim, contradict the ""theme first""
principle. It can be reasonably assumed that the Theme has been ellipsed, being
treated as given. Tagging it indicates that the speaker has changed his/her mind
at this point in the production of the text. The speaker now decides to treat the
information as not given, or at least as requiring some form of elaboration.
(Note that tagged constituents occur on secondary tone units with falling pitch;
this is characteristic of qualifying information units, as in (5-194) above.)
In the examples so far the Theme has usually been a simple clausal
constituent, either a nominal phrase (NP or PP), or an adverbial. In oneTHE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE377example, namely (5-227), the Theme was a complex of such units. Word
complexes and phrase complexes of all types (see section 4.3 above) can be
thematic. However, it is not clear that the Theme must always be realised by a
grammatical unit or a complex of grammatical units. Consider, for example,
(5-237):
(5-237) yingi ... number six I gardiya
-ngga
name
white:people ERG
goowajgoodda I six furlong I niyaji -yangga
they:call:it
this
ABLz
booloodooddwinmi yawarda I garndiwangooddoo I
they:started:off
horse
many
'(The spot) called six furlongs - what white people call it is six
furlongs - from there they started off, all the horses.'
The second clause in this example is divided into two information units, the first
of which has the rising pitch associated with segmented Themes, and consists of
an ERG PP and a VP. As the translation suggests, this clause has a natural
interpretation as a WH-cleft. These two facts suggest that the sequence
gardiyangga goowajgoodda 'white people call it' is a good candidate for Theme.
The constituent realising the Theme of a clause usually realises at the same
time some other role in the clause (or part thereof), experiential or interpersonal.
There is one exception to this, in which the thematic element has an entirely
textual role. The d-words niyinhingi (that-ABL) 'after that, from there',
niyajinhingi (this-ABL) 'after this', and migaya (thus-LOC) 'at that time' are
frequently used as conjunctive elements. The first two are sentential
conjunctions (see for instance lines (49) and (79) of Text 1, and line (3) of Text
3); the third normally conjoins clauses within a single sentence. These
connecting words are almost always thematic, providing a 'starting point' for the
clause/sentence.
The interpersonal role Propositional Modifier, which is realised by
particles and temporal adverbials (see next section), frequently combines with the
textual role of Theme. For examples see (5-216) above and next section. Some
Particles such as mangaddi 'no, not' are invariably thematic; others, including
yiganyi 'uncertain' need not be, although they usually are. If not thematic, they
are typically focal.
The experiential role of Actor (see section 5.2.1.3 above) is statistically
the most frequent choice of Theme in situation clauses. In non-situation clauses
it is the thing characterised or identified that is the preferred choice of Theme.","[358, 359, 360, 361]"
"3.3.5 Proper nouns
Proper nouns are names of persons or places. They invariably realise the role of
Entity in an NP; this NP may of course be embedded within another NP,
usually to indicate the possessor of the thing referred to by the second NP. There
are apparently restrictions on the realisations of other roles in phrases in which
proper nouns occur: the only other role normally filled is that of the Classifier,
as in:
(3-20} riwi ngaJhaddamany
place [p1acename]
'the place Ngathaddamany'Place names are formally distinguishable by the fact that they may occur
with both of the suffixes -wanggoo 'a person who is associated with the place'
and -waddawadda 'everyone associated with the place'. These two suffixes do not
occur in any other context Ideally, the association between the person(s) and the
place is that it is his/her/their dreaming or conception site: boolga-wanggoo
refers (ideally) to a person whose conception site is boolga (i.e. Bulga Swamp}.
However, in actual usage the association may be less stringent. It may be an
affiliation through residence, as when all of the residents of Gogo were referred
to collectively in a text as bamathidi-waddawadda, with no implication that this
place was the conception site of every individual in that community.
Alternatively, it may be an affiliation through birth, or through the patriline
Oess regularly through the matriline). Thus a single individual may on different
occasions be referred to as x-wanggoo for more than one place name x.
Personal names are used infrequently and cautiously, and one way of
avoiding their use is to refer to the individual indirectly through his or her
association with a place, usually his/her conception site or birthplace. An
individual may be referred to in this way so frequently that it becomes a sort of
nickname. This was the case for one old man, now deceased, who was usually
referred to as Malawanggoo 'person associated with Mala, having Mala as his•
ADVERBIAI..S151conception site'. For other individuals this mode of reference was not frequently
employed (at least in my presence), other modes of indirect reference being
preferred
Both place and personal names are normally unanalysable morphologically.
The only exception that has come to my attention is the place name diyadiya
bliddijgilayi '(the place where) the peewee went ""bliddij'"" .
3.4 Adverbials
Adverbials were distinguished above (see section 3.2) by. their ability to realise
clause rank roles of circumstance (including location, direction from, direction
towards, etc.). On the one hand they are distinct from nominals, which may
realise phrasal roles only, never clausal roles. On the other hand, they differ from
particles, which, while they have the property of occurring as constituents of
clauses (where they realise the role of Propositional Modifier - see section
5.4.1), do not realise circumstantial roles.
It has been suggested above that adverbials do not form phrasal units with
one another. They do however form word complexes together. The two
adverbials in clauses such as (3-21), for instance, might initially appear to fonn
a phrase, with mayaaddayaadda 'hard' modifying galjini 'fast' (i.e. 'very fast').
However, such syntagms are very rare, and there is no convincing evidence that
the relation is one of modification, rather than addition (on which see sections
4.3.1 and 5.6.2):
(3-21) mayaad:Jayaadda galjini
hard
fast
'He ran very quickly.'giddagiddayi
he:ranIn fact, as the gloss indicates, it would seem that mayaaddayaadda is better
glossed 'hard' than 'very'. (It does not occur as an intensifier of adverbials other
than those relating to speed; and secondly, it may also occur alone (i.e. without
another adverbial) in clauses of motion carrying the sense 'hard, energetically'.
Thirdly, it is obviously the partial reduplication of mayaadda, which is
segmentable into maya, an adverbial meaning 'hard, energetically' (where the
verb is not one of motion) and the suffix -wadda (on which see 5.5.1.3 below).)
For these reasons, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I assume that
such syntagms are indeed word complexes, and not phrases. A more literal
translation of (3-21) would thus be 'He ran hard and fast'.
Adverbials are as a rule mutually substitutable with PPs; but because they
have quite different ranges of meanings the two are not in complementary----------------------------------------------------------~~·~1HEWORD152distribution, and are frequently found in apposition, each adding something to
the meaning of the other. That is, adverbials and PPs form unit complexes
together (see section 4.3.2 below).
There appear to be four main types of adverbial in Gooniyandi: adverb,
temporal adverbial, spatial adverbial, and frequency adverbial. These will be
discussed in order in the subsections below.
In addition, there are two very general adverbials yiniga 'in some manner,
in what manner', and miga 'in this/that manner', which might perhaps be
regarded as indefinite and deftnite ""determiners"" respectively for adverbials. They
are not used in respect of concrete entities (for which the nominal determiners
discussed in 3.3.1 are used), but rather for types of action, including speech, and
other 'abstracts' such as qualities. For example,yiniga ngawali ngaraggmy)a
how
woomera you:make:it
A: miga
ngaragba
like:this you:make:it
Q: 'How do you make a woomera?'
A: 'You make it like this.'","[135, 136, 137]"
"DATA USED IN THIS INVESTIGATION33Very early in the course of the fieldwork I became aware of problems
inherent in the standard field procedure of eliciting responses to clccontcxtualisz~d
English sentences. It was frequently the case that speakers would, on different
occasions give three or four distinct translation equivalents to a single English
prompt. This problem was particularly bothersome in dealing with categories
which express the speakers' viewpoint and evaluation of the proposition. For
example, a single English verbal category such a'> future tense, which, as is well
known, expresses modal as well as temporal meaning, might emerge as any om~
of three or four Gooniyandi verbal categories (sec section 6.5. 1.3). 'I11c difficulty
is that evaluative meanings such as these arc not as readily accessible tu the
linguist as are the representational or content meanings -- that is, cxrx~ricntial
meaning in Halliday's (e.g. 1970, 1985) terms. It is as a rule easier lO dclcrminc
whether or not the linguist and the native speaker have matching
conceptualisations of the situation described by the English prompt than it is to
determine (out of context) whether they coincide in their perceptions of the
viewpoints and evaluations expressed.
It was clear that in the majority of cases native speakers did not perceive
equivalences, or even unmarkecl correlations between grammatical cmegorics of
English and Gooniyandi. They did not translate prompt sentences category by
category; they appeared to regard translation as a semantic procedure, mther than
a formal operation on strings of linguistic symbols. I could detect no tendency
for speakers to invent calques on English constructions, which, likl~ 'to want'
complement clauses, are expressed by means of totally different categories ami
constructions in Gooniyandi (cf. Heath 1984:582). In seeking a translation for
an English prompt,6 it seemed that the Gooniyandi speaker first imagined some
context in which the English sentence might be uttered, and then found n
suitable Gooniyandi sentence which would have roughly t11c surnc sense in 1hat
context. The problem was that I had no access to the imagined context As a
consequence, it was necessary to modify my method of elicitation so as to
circumscribe, and gain some control of the conteXL'>. This was dnne by verbally
constructing imaginary and real scenarios, especially ones of which both
participants (Gooniyandi speaker and linguist) had some knowkdge. I would
request utterances appropriate Lo describing t11cse situations, and uttcmnccs whit:h
6 This is an oversimplification. In most cases the Gooniyandi speaker did not
speak Standard Australian English, and there was no certainty that s/hc put the
srune values to the categories as I did. Nor could misunderstandings he entirely
eliminated by my using Kriol or Pidgin (of which I claim little speaking contml)
as the prompting language.","[45, 46]"
"POSTPOSIDONS185The exception referred to in the previous paragraph concerns -yawoo ALL4 •
This postposition is sometimes used in the sense of 'time until', when attached
to a nominal such as dina 'dinner', or manyi 'vegetable food'.
All three postpositions are apparently built on -ya LOC. In two cases the
increment is identical with a form of the dative postposition, either -yoo or -woo
(see above). And the remaining form could easily have arisen from -yayoo AL~
by a vocalic change (see section 2.2.5). However, all three are synchronically
unanalysable, being stressed as a single form. The above is, however, a possible
historical source of the forms: in a number of Australian languages the allative
is either built on, or is identical with the dative or the locative. In the
neighbouring Jaru, for example, the allative is, according to Tsunoda (1981:55),
built on the locative, with the addition of -wu, which is an allomorph of the
dative.
We can summarise the system of ""lative"" postpositions as shown in Table
3-6.
Table 3-6: System of lative postpositions
Focus on the terminus Focus on the motion
Motion towards -yidda
Motion from
-yangga-yayi, -yayoo, -yawoo
-nhingiThat the three allative postpositions -yayi ALL2 , -yayoo ALL3 , and -yawoo
ALL4 are restricted to occurring on nominals would seem to be consistent with
this analysis. For their presence on adverbials would be semantically redundant:
spatial adverbials either have distinct 'direction towards' forms, or this is a
possible sense of the adverbial in a clause of motion. When -yidda ALL1 occurs
on a spatial adverbial, the relationship it encapsulates becomes concretised as a
separate entity, which may be the destination of a process of motion. Thus, the
adverbial banyangi 'outside' may occur in a clause of motion with the
postposition -yidda ALL 1 attached. Alternatively, it may occur unmarked by a
postposition in the same clause type. There is a difference in meaning: in the
latter case the motion is represented as directed towards the outside of some
containing medium, whereas in the former case it is represented as actually
reaching some place which forms the outside of some reference place.","[169, 170]"
"488TOPICS IN SEMANI'ICS6.4 Clause modifying particles and adverbials
6.4.1 mangaddi 'not'
This Iexeme is a negative particle which usually has the role of Propositional
Modifier, and indicates that the proposition in its scope is false. It may perhaps
be most accurately glossed 'it is not the case that' - in preference to 'not',
which is a VP constituent in English. (However, for convenience, I will use the
label 'not' in glossing the morpheme, under the understanding that this is an
abbreviation for the longer expression.) The modified proposition may be in any
tense or mood category. (In this respect Gooniyandi differs from many languages
of the Kimberleys, including Ungarinyin (Rumsey 1982b:89), Nyikina (Stokes
1982:280), Nyulnyul (my own fieldnotes), and Miriwoong (Kofod 1978:85) at
least, in which the negative particle occurs with unreal (irrealis and occasionally
negative) modes only.) The meanings of the combinations of mangaddi 'not'
with the various verbal categories are predictable, and will be mentioned at the
relevant points in the discussion of the verbal categories in section 6.5 below.
The word order generalisations made above (section 5.4.1) apply to
mangaddi 'not'. The only thing that needs to be added on this is that occasionally
two instances of mangaddi 'not' are found in a single clause, as illustrated in the
following two examples. (There are no examples of this phenomenon for other
particles.)

"•----------POSTPOSIDONS187(c) the handedness of a person, as in waroogoo-binyi (left-PER) 'left
handed'; in this use, -binyi would appear to fulfil a stem forming function.
On one occasion only, -binyi PER was followed by the ERG postposition
- on repetition of the example, the ERG was omitted. The example was:
(3-97) balyoowa -binyi -ngga gilbawidi
thinga
behind
PER ERG they:found:him foot
They found his footprints from behind.'
An explanation for this phenomenon remains unclear.3.7.2.9 -ngaddi COMITative-ngaddi COMIT marks:
(a) nominal phrases fulfilling the clausal role of Means - see section
5.2.3.3. (In transitive and reflexive/reciprocal clauses, as we have already seem,
-ngaddi COMIT is followed by -ngga ERG.
(b) nominal phrases in the Accompaniment role, when the accompanying
and the accompanied entities are of unequal status- see section 5.2.3.5.
(c) something in close association with an entity, such as a possession.
The possession may be either alienable (example (4-78)) or inalienable (example
(3-98)).
(3-98) ngaragnga goornboo gamoo -ngaddi
he:made:it woman
breast COMIT
'He painted a woman with breasts.'
As examples (4-78) and (3-98) demonstrate, this sense arises when the
-ngaddi PP fulfils a role in a phrase. It also occurs when the comitative PP
functions as Attribute in a characterising clause - see section 5.2.1.1.1.2.
There is, however, as has already been mentioned, no reason to regard nominals
marked with -ngaddi COMITas derived adjectives (cf. Dixon 1980:324-325).
Finally, there are a few apparently irregular uses of -ngaddi COMIT, in
which this postposition seems to function as a stem forming suffix:
yoowarningaddi (one-COMIT) 'once', ngirndangaddi (this-COMIT) 'this way',
ngirndangaddingga (this-COMIT-ERG) 'this side'. ngooddoongaddingga (thatCOMIT-ERG) 'that side', yinigangaddi (somehow-COMIT) 'by some means, by
what means'. There are also half a dozen or so mother-in-law avoidance
nominals, including bin.gidi-ngaddi (feather-COMIT) 'bird' and wanya-ngaddi
(emu feather-COMIT) 'emu', which are analysable as ordinary nominal plus the188THE WORDcomitative postposition.3.7.2.10 -winyja DEPrivative
The postposition -winyja DEP is quite infrequent in occurrence, and seems to be
used in only one function. That is, to indicate something - always a thing,
never a process - the lack of which causes an event to occur; see section
5.2.3.6 and examples (5-159) and (5-160).
It should be noted that Gooniyandi has no bound morpheme, either suffix
or postposition, that functions as a regular privative marker. Instead, to express
this meaning, the negative particle marlami 'nothing, without' is used following
(usually) the nominal referring to the thing lacked. The contrast between these
two expressions, NP-winyja, and [N mar/ami], is that the former has the
additional semantic component, absent from the latter, that the lack of the thing
is the cause of the process. In keeping with this, only the latter occurs in
relational clauses expressing 'x has no y'.3.7.2.11 -yooddoo - -yiddi DUal and -yarndi PLural
These two postpositions, -yooddoo- -yiddi DU and -yarndi PL, optionally mark
the number of an NP as either dual or plural (three or more) respectively. As yet
it is not clear what factors motivate the occurrence or non-occurrence of these
morphemes on non-singular NPs. (A likely hypothesis is that they are used: (i)
in initial specification of number, and otherwise (ii) to help keep reference clear,
for instance when a text involves two (or more) groups of items which would be
referred to by the same nominal, but which consist of different numbers of these
items. But this hypothesis has not been tested by extensive textual
investigation.) Examples of usage include (4-77), (4-86), (4-95), (4-96), and
lines (5), (21) and (61) of Text 1, and line (6) of Text 2.
3.8 EncliticsUnlike postpositions and stem forming suffixes, enclitics do not form, together
with the units to which they are attached, other grammatical units of the same
rank as those to which they are attached. Therefore, enclitics do not allow for
recursive embedding, such as is possible to a limited extent with postpositions
and stem forming suffixes.
The following are the main enclitics:•
ENCUTICS-moowa
-nyooloo
-ngaddaya
-widdi
-jangi-rni
-mi- -ma
-nyali
-woo189'only' (ON)
'etcetera' (ETC)
'else, too' (TOO)
'identity unknown' (UNKN)
'like' (SEM)
'next, now' (SEQ)
'indefinite, question' (IND)
'repetition, again' (REP)
'definite' (DEF)The glosses given above should not be taken seriously; they are meant to be no
more than suggestive. For a detailed discussion of the meanings of these
morphemes, see section 6.3 below.
The enclitic -jangi SEM is exceptional in that it sometimes forms a g-unit with
the constituent to which it is attached - see for instance, examples (6-95) and
(6-96) below. The fact that it does not ALWAYS form such a unit justifies its
classification as an enclitic. This does, however, necessitate a slight modification
to the definition given in the first paragraph of this section: enclitics are
morphemes which do not necessarily form g-units with the units to which they are
attached. (Postpositions and stem forming suffixes always do.)The enclitics show very little allomorphy - which is partly because none
of the initial consonants are affected by rules discussed in section 2.4. The
indefinite enclitic is the only one showing altemant forms. Its allomorphs -rna
and -mi are chosen depending on the class of the item to which they are attached:
-ma if it is verbal, -mi otherwise.
Two subsets may be distinguished: the first, consisting of the six
morphemes -moowa ON, -nyooloo ETC, -ngaddaya TOO, -widdi UNKN, -jangi
SEM and -rni SEQ from the list above, may be attached to non-verbal units
only, while the remaining three occur with all classes of units, verbal and nonverbal. When attached to non-verbal items, enclitics typically occur in final
position, following all other bound morphemes. But in the VP, -rna IND and
-nyali REP occur medially, in order class (3), labeled Mood in formula F1 on
page 192 below; that is, it follows the first grammatical word of the VP. -Woo
DEF, by contrast, follows the CC word and occurs in position (5), labeled Mode
in Fl. Placement of the enclitics is not arbitrary, but correlates with the 'scope'
and 'focus' of the enclitic (see section 6.3).
Sequences of enclitics do occur, though too infrequently to permit firm
generalisations to be made at this stage; I suspect (but cannot demonstrate) that
their order is meaningful. The only sequence that is at all common is190'IHEWORD-jangi-nyali SEM-REP 'just/exactly like', as in minyawoo-jangi-nyali (cat-SEMREP) 'just like a cat'.
3.9 The verb phrase
In this section I discuss the structure of the 'verb' - that distributional word and
grammatical phmse which realises the clausal role of Process.
3.9.1 Verbals
Verbals have already been def""med as those lexical (open-class) words which are
bound; all other lexical words have the privilege of free occurrence. Verbals have
just two contexts of occurrence: they occur either as constituents of finite VPs,
or as non-finite verbs. Although words of other classes may occur in the first
context, only verballexemes occur in the second. Furthennore, every verbal may
occur within a non-finite 'purposive' clause, in which construction it is followed
by the -woo allomorph of the dative postposition (see page 174 above)- e.g.
ward-goo (go-D AT) 'for going', bayal-woo (swim-DAT) 'for swimming'.
Another distinctive property of verbals is, as we have already seen, that, as a
class, they show phonotactic differences from the words of other lexical classes:
final consonants are permitted and frequent (section 2.2.5); there are statistically
significant differences in distribution of initial consonants in verbals compared
with other classes (section 2.2.5); and there is a high frequency of (closed)
monosyllables (section 2.3.1).
I have been unable to distinguish subclasses within the class of verbals. In
particular, it is not possible to distinguish disjoint classes of transitive and
intransitive verbals (cf. Dixon 1980:378). Whereas in many Australian
languages transitivity may be regarded as a lexical feature of verbs (Dixon
1980:278), in Gooniyandi transitivity has a clausal locus, and a single verbal
lexeme may occur in clauses of more than one transitivity type. Choice of
classifier may go some way towards distinguishing the transitivity of a VP for example, ward-ji (go-PAST/(3sg)N+I) 'he went' vs. ward-nga (goPAST/(3sg)N+A) 'he took it'. However, it proves equally impossible to
distinguish transitivity classes at phrase level as at word level (see sections
5.2.1.3 and 6.5.5 below).
Verbals in Gooniyandi constitute a large open class of lexemes which refer
to all sorts of processes, including: states (e.g. wara- 'stand', bagi- 'lie'); changes
of state (e.g. nang- 'die'); motion, including induced motion (e.g. ward- 'go,
walk, bring'); violent actions (such as gard- 'hit, fell', bananggadd- 'snatch');THE VERB PHRASE191perception and mental processes (e.g. danymili- 'hear, listen'. mila- 'see, look');
communication (for examplejangi- 'answer',jag- 'tell'); and so on.
3.9.2 The non-finite verb
Within non-finite clauses, which are always embedded in some other unit
(section 5.5), there occurs a semantically impoverished verbal construction
which consists of either a bare verbal stem, or of a verbal stem followed by an
infinitive, either -bari (section 5.5.3.1) or -mawoo (section 5.5.3.2). As a
constituent of a clause, the non-finite verbal construction ought to be of phrase
level. However, since the only way in which a verbal root may be expanded is
by the addition of a (verbal) stem forming suffix (see section 3.12.2.1), or by
the addition of an infinitive, there seems to be little independent reason to regard
the construction as a phrase, and as a consequence, I do not make this
assumption. In contrast with the finite VP, the non-finite verb carries very little
information about the process: no reference is made to the participants involved
in it, temporal and modal distinctions are not made, and the semantic type of the
process is not indicated.
When there is no infinitive, the verbal stem, being a bound form, must be
followed by another morpheme, either a postposition or a nominal stem forming
suffix (see 3.12.1.1 below), depending on whether the non-finite clause is
embedded under a PP node or under a word node. (Postpositions and stem
forming suffixes, as distinct from infinitives, are not constituents of the nonfinite verb, as will be shown below, in section 5.5.) Infinitival constructions are
usually found in non-finite clauses attributing on participant roles (section 5.2)
in the finite clauses in which they (the non-finite clauses) are embedded. In the
present data, -ngga ERG is the only postposition that ever follows an infinitive.
(Further fieldwork may uncover other combinations.)
3.9.3 The finite verb phrase
Finite VPs occur in non-embedded ""situation"" type clauses (see section 5.2.1),
in which they realise the role of Process. A finite VP consists of two obligatory
constituents, a lexical 'head' referring to the process, and a classifier complex
(CC), which indicates the person and number of the main participants in the
process (see 5.2.1.3 below), tense, and the type of process it is (in terms of the
features described in section 6.5.5 below). In addition to these two obligatory
constituents there are a number of optional elements carrying aspectual, modal
and other qualification of the process. A schematic representation of the VP isTHE WORD192
given in the following formula:F1 Process-(Aspect)-(Mood)-CC-(Mode)-(Oblique pronominal)-(Number)
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
where brackets enclose optional elements.
As was claimed earlier, this unit is a singled-word of phrasal rank; it is
not an inflectional form of the Process lexeme. Its two obligatory constituents
are g-words. The' remaining, optional constituents are enclitics to these words.
That is, these optional constituents do not form g-words with the obligatory
constituents. There is no evidence, for example, that Process plus Aspect is an
inflectional form of the lexical root filling the role of Process, or that the two
together form a distinct stem. In the absence of such evidence, I make the
weakest assumption, that the aspect markers etc. are constituents of the verb
phrase.
A finite VP may consist of between two and four (perhaps five at the
most) phonological words (as defined in section 2.5.1). The two grammatical
words, the item realising the role of Process, and the CC, are usually distinct
phonological words; but, as mentioned earlier (see pages 128 and 135), the
boundary of the phonological word may move forwards, and so not coincide with
the grammatical boundary. Monosyllabic enclitics are, with one exception,
unstressed and cohere with the preceding phonological word. The exception is
the bound oblique pronominal enclitic -nhi 'to him/her/it', which takes stress.
Enclitic morphemes of two or more syllables are usually phonological words,
and are stressed on their initial syllable. There are just a few exceptions without
initial stress, all of which have an initial {w}, which is affected by VR6: {wila}
FACT (see below 3.9.3.4); the allomorph {wanhi} of the third person singular
oblique pronominal enclitic (see section 3.9.3.6); and the allomorph ( waddi} of
the paucal number enclitic (see section 3.9.3.7).
It appears that (3) (Mood) and (5) (Mode) in Fl are in complementary
distribution; otherwise there are examples displaying choices from all other
combinations of categories. Some examples (written phonemically) are:

A: 'What do I call him?'
B: 'No(thing). He'sjoowooddoo; you call him brother-in-law.'
It remains unclear just what sense mangaddi 'not' conveys here. In both
circumstances outlined above, mar/ami 'nothing, without' (see discussion of next
section) occurs far more frequently than does mangaddi 'not'.
6.4.2 marlami 'nothing, without'
Gooniyandi has another word for expressing negation, mar/ami 'nothing,
without', which indicates that no entity, time, or place is involved in the referent
situation. It corresponds to the English words 'no', 'nothing'. 'nowhere', and
'never', and is frequently glossed najing (from standard English nothing) in
Pidgin English and Kriol. As distinct from mangaddi 'not', mar/ami 'nothing,
without' never functions as a Propositional Modifier. Rather, it negates an entity
or circumstance, and from this the clause itself may gain negative force, as
happens with the English words nothing, nowhere, and so on.
Mar/ami 'nothing, without' has three main contexts of occurrence, which
are not always distinguishable: (i) it may realise a phrasal role; (ii) it may realise
a clausal circumstantial role of time or place; or (iii) it may be used as an
interjection.
(i) I will first deal with the case in which mar/ami 'nothing, without'
fulfils a modifying role in an NP. There are two main possibilities: it may
precede or follow the Entity nominal. The relative order is significant, and finds
clearest explanation in terms of Bolinger's (1967) distinction between referent
modification and reference modification, discussed above (see page 267). In
addition, the phrase in which it occurs may function either attributively, within
another phrase (i.e. as a Qualifier or Classifier) or clause, or referentially.
In the first case, the phrase attributes of an entity the property of being
without something, as discussed in section 5.2.3.5 above. The usual word order
is for mar/ami 'nothing, without' to follow the Entity nominal, as exemplified
in e.g. (4-36) and (4-79). Only rarely does it precede the Entity nominal, as in
(6-119) nginyji binaddi nganyi marlami
you
know I
not
'(As) you know, I have no car.'moodiga
motorcarIn referential phrases marlami 'nothing, without' typically precedes theCLAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBJALS491Entity, and indicates that nothing of the type referred to by the Entity nominal
was involved in the referent situation. In this circumstance marlami 'nothing,
without' clearly modifies the reference of the phrase. For example,
(6-120) mar/ami gamba ngambiddi baali -ya
not
water again
road LOC
'There's no water again on the road.'
(6-121) marlami banda doowwidtkl
not
ground they:got:it
'They got no dirt.'
Note: (6-120) and (6-121) may be contrasted with sentences such as (5-258) and
(5-259) in which mangaddi 'not' occurs in the same place in the clause. There is a
sharp distinction in meaning. With marlami 'nothing, without'. there is no focus
on the following element, and no presupposition that the predicate holds true of
anything (although it may).","[473, 474, 475]"
"•, Ii'THE CLAUSEThere are two main possibilities: the action may be directed out from the
Agent to some (conceptually) distinct entity, or it may be directed back on itself,
from the Agent back to the same entity. In the latter instance, there are two
further possibilities: either the activity is directed from each single entity
constituting the (set of) Agent(s) back on to itself (giving the reflexive sense),
or it is directed among the entities constituting the (set of) Agent(s) if this has
more than one member. Only one inherent participant role is involved in this
process type, the Agent himself/herself, and the Process (realised by the VP) is
explicitly marked as directed back on itself by the choice of one of the two
classifiers +ARNI2 and +MARNI.
In case the action is directed from the Agent to a conceptually distinct
Goal, there are two possibilities: the clause may be transitive or middle. The
difference between these two modes concerns the relation that the Goal bears to
the process. In transitive clauses the Goal is an essential feature in the
actualisation of the process, and the action must extend to and reach it, in order
to be effected. Of course I do not mean to suggest that there must be some actual
physical connection between the Agent and the Goal. What I am saying is that
the 'transfer' of action must be completed. This transfer is clear enough in
processes such as gard- 'hit', galiny- 'carry', gaj- 'cut', gajgaj- 'chop', and other
such ""material"" processes, which are clearly actualised through the Goal. (If the
Goal is missed, the process goes unactualised.) But the same also holds for
processes of perception and cognition, such as mila- 'see, look at', danymili'hear, listen to', lingi- 'think about', etc.: the Goal must be actually perceived in
order for the transitive process to be actualised.
On the other hand, middle clauses refer to processes in which the Goal need
not be reached in order for the process to be achieved. Typical middle clauses
include such processes as nyimij- 'wink at', jijag- talk to, miga- 'tell to',
nyamnyam- 'whisper to', yiniga- 'do something to', moow- 'search for', etc .. In
all of these cases the Goal need not be reached in order for the process to be
effected: the person winked at, spoken to, etc. need not receive the
communication; the person sought after need not be found, and so on.
The differences between the two possibilities may be more accurately
described in the following terms. In the transitive mode the Goal is a MEDIUM
- that is, as above, it is something through which the process is actualised and
enacted. In the middle mode, the Goal is instead implicated or involved in the
process, as something towards which the action is directed, but not something
through which the process must be actualised. In a few cases there are minimal
pairs for this distinction. (5-65) and (5-66) are examples involving mila· 'see',THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION325which in the transitive mode requires that the process be actualised through the
thing perceived, but which in the middle mode does not require actualisation.
Other minimal pairs can be found, and more particularly, every type (b)
transitive clause (see page 319 above) is agnate with a middle clause. The
Medium/Goal of the former corresponds with the non-Medium/Goal of the latter:III(5-70) nganyi -ngga boolja I tlrldda thoolnglimi -nhi

irregular in terms of the construction of the pronominal configuration, which

Only one of the rules mentioned above, namely (4), CCR9, also applies to
{boo}, and it does so in similar grammatical environments. (2) (i.e. CCR7) is
prevented from applying by the choice of the oo allomorph following dd; (3)
(i.e. CCR4) can apply only to {bini}; and (1) (VR2) cannot apply since there is
always at least an intervening tense morpheme between {boo} and the verb root.

~ /gardginggoowoo/-woo}'he's hitting you'DEFThe function of the classifiers is to indicate the type of process that is
referred to. They cJassify the lexical words (which realise the VP role Process in
Fl) with which they occur, thereby modifying their significance. Classifiers do
not divide the set of verballexemes into disjoint subsets. Most verbal lexemes
collocate with more than one classifier, and the choice between these classifiers
distinguishes among various process types that may be referred to by the same
lexical item. The processes differ in terms of the meaning features set out in the
second and third columns of Table 3-7 (see also section 6.5.5).
The classifiers numbered (I) to (5), (9) and (IO) may occur with
pronominal prefix configurations referring to two actants in the referent
situation. However, all of them except (apparently) for +ADDI may occur with a
single pronominal prefix, which makes reference to a single actant. On the other
hand, those classifiers numbered (6) to (8), (II) and (12) may occur with only
one pronominal prefix. I will refer to them as monovalent rather than
intransitive, since they can occur in some clauses of 'directed action' (see section
5.2.I.3).
At the least 'delicate' level, classifiers may be divided into two groups: (a)
those which classify the process as an ACCOMPUSHMENT; and (b) those which
classify it as EXTENDIBLE. +I is the only exception: it usually indicates
extendibles, but in certain well defined circumstances it can refer to
accomplishments, as will be mentioned below. As I use the term here,
'accomplishment' refers to any process for which there is an inherent point at2021HEWORDwhich it is actualised, before which it has not yet occurred, and after which it has
occurred, and is completed. Examples are processes such as 'hit', 'arrive'. 'die',
etc •. Accomplishments often have 'trains' of circumstances leading up to their
point of actualisation, such as for example the nearing of the destination in the
process 'arrive'. But, until the point of actualisation is reached, the process
cannot truthfully be said to have occurred. After the point has been reached, the
process in usually completed, and may then be truthfully described in a clause in
the past tense. By 'extendible' I mean processes without such points of
completion: once started, they can (at least in principle) continue on indefinitely.
Examples include processes such as 'walk'. 'sit', 'see', 'carry', etc .. There is no
inherent point of accomplishment for processes like these.
Other meanings, very roughly glossed in the final column of Table 3-7 can
be attributed to the individual classifiers. These will be discussed in more detail
in section 6.5.5. A few further remarks may be in order here, for the reader's
orientation.
Many more subdivisions are made within accomplishments than
extendibles, of which there are only three subtypes, which very broadly
correspond to the trichotomy transitive (+A), intransitive (+I) and
reflexive/reciprocal (+ARNI:z). However, the importance of the major division
accomplishment/extendible can be seen from the fact that all distinctions other
than this one are neutralised in the reflexive/reciprocal.
It is tempting to analyse· the -rni in +ARNI2 and +MARNI as a
reflexive/reciprocal suffix to the two classifiers +A and +MI. However, +ARNI2
chooses different allomorphs of the first person singular to +A, and has an
irregular third person singular. And +MARNI cannot be regarded as consisting of
the (mad allomorph of +MI, since (i) the first vowel of +MARNI does not
harmonise with the vowel of the preceding syllable, and (ii) rule CCR13 cannot
be modified to give /a/ as the realisation of (a1 } preceding rn, since this does not
occur when the /rn/ belongs to the potential mode -rni (see below section
3.9.3.5). A special allomorph {rna}, occurring only before the
reflexive/reciprocal -rni would need to be proposed in order to account for the
occurring forms. The same problem would arise for the suggestion that +ARNI2
should be segmented into +I+rni. For all of these reasons, I regard +ARNI2 and
+MARNI as distinct classifiers.
+BINDI is much more restricted in behaviour than the other classifiers. It
occurs only with pronominal prefixes of singular number; the corresponding
plurals occur with the classifier +L For example, nyamaniloondi (from
{nyamani-li+bindi} (big-(lsg)N+BINDI)) 'I grew big', but nyamaniwiddi (from203THE VERB PHRASE{nyamani-bidd+i} (big-(3pl)N+I)) 'they grew big', or 'they are big'. Furthermore,
+BINDI explicitly refers to the point of accomplishment of the process. and so
is never found with the progressive aspect. Reference to the train of events
leading up to the accomplishment must be made through use of the classifier +I,.
as in nyamaniwangi (from {nyamani-wa-ng+i} (big-PROG+(lsg)N+I)) 'I was
getting big'. It is probably also for this reason that +BINDI is almost never
found in commands, or other uses of language aimed at modifying the behaviour
of the hearer, in all of which cases +I is again favoured. (This is presumablY
because the focus of commands is no engagement in the process over its
completion.) Example:

in most ergative languages in which the reflexive/reciprocal is verbally encoded
the one obligatory constituent is an unmarked or 'absolutive' one (Edmonson
1978:646-647). It is normally only in those ergative languages in which it is
not verbally encoded that the inherent constituent is an ergatively marked one.
And in keeping with Edmonson's typology, in the Pama-Nyungan languages to
the south of Gooniyandi, Walmajarri (Hudson 1978:66), Wangkajunga (my
fieldnotes), Nyangumarta (Nash 1980:205), which also have the obligatory
constituent in the ergative, the reflexive/reciprocal is realised by an enclitic
pronominal, and is not a feature of the verb.
(2) Unlike a number of so called ""ergative"" languages, ergative marking in
Gooniyandi occurs on all phrase types, irrespective of person (cf. Dixon 1979).
However it is optional: in each of the clause types marked above as having an
ERG PP, the ERG postposition may be omitted, and the participant role may be
realised by an NP instead. There is however a strong correlation between
inanimacy and the realisation by an ERG PP. An inanimate in the appropriate
role is almost invariably realised by an ERG PP.
The exact significance of the presence vs. absence of the postposition remains
unclear. It might be remarked, however, that its main function is not simply to
di~tinguish between the ""subject"" and the ""object"" (to use these terms loosely,
Wlth the obvious senses), as has been claimed with respect to a number of
'optionally ergative' languages, such as Dalabon (Capell 1962: 111), Murrinhpatha (Walsh 1976:405), Motu, etc. (cf. Dixon 1979:71). That this is the case
should be clear from the following observations: In two of the clause types in
which ERG PPs occur, reflexive/reciprocal and middle, it is clear that the ERG is
not needed to distinguish between any roles. Secondly, there are many instances'l··I

"1.2 Territory and surrounding languages
The Gooniyandi people traditionally occupied quite a large tract of land,
extending from Fitzroy Crossing in the west to the vicinity of Margaret River
Station in the east, a distance of some one hundred and fifty kilometres, west to
east. This territory abuts on the Great Sandy Desert in the south, and extends
into the King Leopold Ranges in the north. Two large rivers, the Margaret River
and Christmas Creek, as well as a number of smaller creeks, water the
countryside, which is predominantly river flats intersected by numerous
limestone ranges. The approximate extent of the Gooniyandi territory, as well as
the territories of the neighbouring peoples, is shown on Map 1 (see also Tindale
1974).
The languages spoken in the vicinity are representatives of five distinct
language families, according to O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966), and
Wurm (1972)- compare Capell (1940) and (1956/1966). Although it has more
recently been suggested that aJl Australian Aboriginal languages (with two or
three possible exceptions) belong to a single family (Dixon 1980:3), genetic
relations between these five families have not yet been conclusively
demonstrated.
Walmajarri, Jaru, and Wangkajunga, traditionally spoken to the south and
east of Gooniyandi, are the local representatives of the Pama-Nyungan family,
which covers most of the Australian continent (see e.g. map facing page 112 of
Wurm 1972). The Jarrakan (Djeragan, in older spelling) family, of which Kija is
a member, was located to the north and north-east of Gooniyandi; languages of
the Nyulnyulan family, which includes Nyikina, were spoken to the west of
Gooniyandi; the Worrorran (elsewhere spelled Wororan) languages, including
Worrorra and Ungarinyin, were spoken to the north and north-west of Bunuba,5TERRITORY AND SURROUNDING LANGUAGESINDIANWorrorraWyndhameKununurrao

(on approximately 1500 items of Stokes et a/1980)
(on Hale's 100 item list; my own field notes)The two members of the Bunuban family, Gooniyandi and Bunuba, arc
fairly close genetic relatives, and are lexically, grammatically, and typologically
quite similar. They are perhaps as similar as Italian and Spanish. There is also
quite a high degree of bilingualism in the two languages, especially among lhe
older generation of Gooniyandi and Bunuba people.
The phonological inventories of Gooniyandi and Bunuba are identical
except that Bunuba has a phonemically distinct lamina-dental lateral phoneme
/lh/ (Alan Rumsey pers.comm.), not found in Gooniyandi. Gooniyandi and
Bunuba showed a cognate density of about 45% on a 138 item list, which
included lhe 100 items of Hale's core vocabulary for Australian languages (the
words marked by double asterisks in Sutton and Walsh 1979), plus some other
starred words from an AIAS word list current as of 22/1/1975 (Rumsey
pers.comm.). A count of some of the more frequent and easily segmentable
bound morphemes (36 in number) showed a somewhat higher cognate rate of
66%. The verbal constructions in the two languages are quite similar. But
whereas in Gooniyandi the verbal complex is a minimal free form in which the
verbal stem and the classifier complex (see section 3.9.3.2) are bound to one
another, in Bunuba one of the verbal auxiliaries (which arc the Bunuba
counterparts of Gooniyandi classifiers), namely -ma, has the privilege of free
occurrence (Rumsey pers.comm.).
The Bunuban family differs in a number of typological respects from the
surrounding families. For example, unlike the Worrorran and Jarrakan families,
noun classes are not distinguished, and the nominal phrase exhibits ergative
marking. Secondly, the lamina-palatal vs. lamina-dental contrast in stops and
nasals is found in the Bunuban and Jarrakan languages, but not in the nearby
Pama-Nyungan or Nyulnyulan languages, and in only one Worrorran language,GOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIETY7namely Unggumi (which is geographically contiguous with Bunuba).
However, the five families are by no means totally dissimilar, and there are
a number of common features shared by two or more families, or pairs of
languages from different families. A number of these similarities are fairly
certainly the result of areal diffusion; none can be said with certainty to be
retentions from putative earlier proto-languages. For example, all of the
languages shown on Map 1 have bound pronominals which cross-reference
certain actants in the clause. In the non-Pama-Nyungan languages, they are
typically prefixed to the verbal auxiliary (or classifier in the case of Gooniyandi),
while in the Pama-Nyungan languages they are suffixed to a ""catalyst"" (Capell
1956/1966: 11), or to the first word of a clause. It is also likely that at some
stage the preverb-auxiliary construction, as it may be called (following
McConvell pers.comm.), typical of most languages in the area, including the
Pama-Nyungan ones, was diffused. Such a construction is undoubtedly the
historical source of the Gooniyandi verbal complex, in which the two elements,
the preverb and the auxiliary, have fused into a single free word. Changes have
led to a reanalysis of the verbal complex into root plus classifier.
1.3 Geographical variation
A few minor geographical differences were encountered in Gooniyandi speech.
These were almost entirely lexical. In boundary regions there is usually a
slightly higher percentage of common vocabulary, shared with the neighbouring
language. For example, in the speech of the Gooniyandi people of Yiyili, which
is ncar the eastern border of their territory, a couple of words were encountered
which are shared with Kija and/or Jaru, but which are not usually heard in the
Gooniyandi speech of Fitzroy Crossing and nearby communities. One such word
is gardij- 'cut', which is shared with Kija. However, the differences are too few to
justify the identification of distinct dialects, and none are named (but cf. below).
The speakers themselves are aware of variation in their language, some of
which they attribute to regions, some to particular individuals in these regions
- but never, in my experience, to socio-linguistic factors such as formality.
The main variation perceived is lexical, but speakers are also conscious of some
minor grammatical differences,2 and of a handful of words which have two
2 For instance, on one occasion a verb form which I constructed was rejected as
proper Gooniyandi, but acknowledged as a form used by some Gooniyandi/Kija
speakers in Mulurrja. And some verb forms in the Gooniyandi word book produced
in the Yiyili School (Yiyili Aboriginal Conununity School 1983) differ from the8INTRODUCTIONslightly different phonemic representations. However, it seems that speakers are
not always strictly correct in their expressed beliefs. My observation of actual
usage showed that the variant pronunciation of ginharndi 'you know' as
ginyarndi, for instance, was not geographically determined, despite native
speakers' claims. The so called 'light' form, with the !amino-palatal nasal in the
second syllable, was found in the community in which it was claimed to be
used, but beside the 'heavy' form with the !amino-dental. Moreover, the light
form was also found in other, geographically remote, communities. It may be
that the choice is governed by other factors such as the age or linguistic
provenance of the speaker or the degree of formality of the speech situation, bm
I was unable to verify any of these possibilities.
Quite often speech differences were labeled joowarliny by native speakers of
Gooniyandi (although this term was never used to name anything which could be
unequivocally identified as a dialect). Interestingly, this term (Juwarliny in
Walmajarri orthography) is also the name of a western dialect of Walmajarri
(Hudson and Richards 1978:3). Tentatively, it would seem that the Gooniyandi
term signifies unusualness, non-standard variety (with reference to the speaker's
variety), with connotations of barbarism.","[17, 18, 19, 20, 21]"
"PHONOfACTICS73-di deletion applies to only a small subset of words ending in -ndi,
and this subset is not characterisable or distinguishable from its
complement either formally or semantically; and as remarked above, only
one known -rndi final word undergoes deletion of final -rdi. It is therefore
necessary to mark with a diacritic those words which may optionally
undergo the rule.
It is possible that the -di in -ndi is a relic of an old gender suffix (Alan Rumsey,
pers.comm.). In Ungarinyin, di is an anaphoric element for w-class nominals
which include words for languages, stone things and water (compare the list
above). When used attributive, di (which is a free word in Ungarinyin) always
follows the head noun of the phrase. Furthermore, the majority of Ungarinyin
nouns with final -n are of thew-class (Rumsey 1982b:37,40,41). Additional
evidence suggesting an earlier morpheme boundary within these words is the
existence of a number of close cognates in Jaru, which differ only in the absence
of the fmal -di (and sometimes of fmal -doo). For example, the subsection called
jawandi by the Gooniyandi is invariably jawan in Jaru (fsunoda 1981:8);2 and the
term for 'ashes' is kawun in Jaru (Tsunoda 1981:33), but gawoondoo (never
gawoon) in Gooniyandi (see also Rumsey 1982b:41). (The form gawoondoo
'ashes' is easily accounted for in terms of vowel harmony.) It has been noticed
that the variants with fmal -n are more frequent in the Yiyili community, which
borders on Jaru territory. Indeed, Yiyili people have more contact in the direction
of Halls Creek than with the Gooniyandi communities of Fitzroy Crossing.
Variants with fmal -ndi are more frequent in Fitzroy Crossing, where, for example,
I have never heard jaw an in place of jawandi.",[68]
"382THE CLAUSE5.4 Remarks on the interpersonal organisation of the clause
5.4.1 Propositional modification
A third aspect of the organisation of the clause is its organisation as an
interactive event, involving the interlocutors in the speech situation. In an
interactive event a clause may be used either: (a) to exchange information, or (b)
exchange 'goods and services' (Halliday 1985:68). (This is something of an
oversimplification, although it is useful as an initial hypothesis - see
McGregor 1988c.) Gooniyandi does not distinguish formally between these two
types of act There is no distinct imperative or any other such related category,
either within the verb phrase or within the clause: e.g. a clause in the future
tense may be used in either way, to exchange information, or to exchange 'goods
and services' (see section 6.5.1 below, and cf. Halliday 1985:68).
Simultaneously, the clause may be used in: (i) giving or offering, and (ii)
requesting or demanding. Again these are not distinguished formally in
Gooniyandi. For example, there is no grammatically distinct class of questions
(as has been mentioned already- see section 5.3.1). Exactly the same forms are
used in eliciting information as in giving information. As we have seen, the
enclitic -mi - -ma (see section 6.3.8) which is frequently found in requests of
confrrmation (i.e. 'yes' or 'no'), and the words ngoonyoo 'something (from a
closed set of options', ngoorndoo 'something', etc. (see 3.3.1.2) frequently found
in information requests (where they mean, respectively 'which' and 'who'), really
mark indefiniteness (cf. Dixon 1977:182ft).
That aspect of the meaning of a clause which remains constant across all of
these functions will be referred to as the PROPOSITIONAL CONTENT of the
clause.
In its role in the exchange of information, the propositional content of a
clause is ASSERTED by the speaker. In the case of requests of information (i.e.
corresponding to WH-questions in English) the propositional content involves
an indefinite in the place of the information requested (cf. pages 369-370 above).
That is, the propositional content of the information request (5-240) above,
jajiwami ngabbiddayi ginharndiyiddingga 'What is it that that pair have eaten?' is
'That pair have eaten something.'
In the case of requests of confirmation, as has already been suggested, the
speaker makes an assertion in the hope that the hearer will respond to it, either
confrrming or denying it. (This may be a reflex of the culturally appropriate
mode of information seeking - including confirmation seeking - which
involves at least the pretence of offering something for comment, elaboration,
etc., rather than direct probing - cf. Eades 1982, McGregor 1988c.) TheINTERPERSONAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE383propositional content of the clause may include the element 'indefinite'. Thus,
ward-ma-wiri (go-IND-you:will:go) has a propositional content 'You are going
(or doing something else)'. This assertion invites a response from the hearer. It
is for this reason that I refer to clauses used in the function of exchange of
infonnation as ASSERTIONS.
It should be noted carefully that I am not suggesting that Gooniyandi people do
not ask questions. This is quite false (for further discussion of this point, see
McGregor 1988c). What I am saying is that grammatically there is no distinct
category of questions; the same forms that are used in making statements are also
used in asking questions. This fact itself may lend some support to Eades'
suggestions as to the differences in the way in which Aboriginal and European
cultures exchange (and view) information. The lack of a distinct category means
that it is always possible for either the speaker or the hearer to use the hedge that
the utterance was in fact a statement pure and simple.","[365, 366, 367]"

3.4.4 Frequency adverbialsThere are three frequency adverbials, perspicuously derived from the first three
number words: yoowarningaddi 'once', garndiwiddja 'twice' and ngarlooddja
'thrice'. I have no corresponding form for 'many times', and the word for 'always,
all the time', ngaddarni, is a particle, not an adverbial. An example of use of a
frequency adverbial is:
(3-68) yoowarningaddi gardboowooooce
you:will:hit:him
'Hit him once.'
Frequency adverbials are also used in counting the number of days over
which a process extends. For example,•

thrice
'I might be away three/a few days.'
(3-70) ngar/ooddja bagiyiddi

It is possible to be more explicit by using the nominal riwi 'camp, place'
in the sense of 'day':
(3-71) yoowarningaddi riwi bagiyiddi
once
camp we:lay
We camped (there) one day.'
3.4.5 Concluding remarks
Gooniyandi adverbials form a rich system, even if the class itself has relatively
few members. The description given above shows the broad outlines only. There
remain a number of words whose status as adverbials remains doubtful. Joorloo
'together (normally as a pair)', moolba 'together (as a large group)' are almost
certainly properly classified as adverbials; so also are mawirndi 'hold in a bear
hug' and mirngriya 'dodge (out of the way of a missile)'. For some other words,
such as briyandi 'in turn, in retaliation', and galanyi 'do first' it is, however,
more difficult to be certain of their status as adverbials rather than particles.
3.5 Particles
Gooniyandi has a small class of a dozen or so particles, which are non-ranking dwords that enter into syntagmatic relations with clauses, which they contain
within their 'scope' (see example (3-3)). As mentioned earlier, particles modify
the propositional content of clauses (on which see also section 5.4.1 below).
Particles may be defined as those lexemes that are also d-words, and which
contain clauses within their scope, but do not occur in other clausal roles. The
last qualification is necessary because there are at least three temporal adverbials
-namely ngamoo 'before', yaningi 'now' and wamba 'later··- which can, and
fairly commonly do, function as propositional modifiers.
The following are the main particles:TiffiWORD166mangaddi

'but really, in actual fact'
'completely, certainly'
'true''maybe, perhaps'
'not' (avoidance style)
'always'
'again, next time'
'almost, nearly'
'already'The glosses given here are to be taken with a grain of salt; for a detailed
discussion of the semantics of the particles, see section 6.4.
Unlike nominals and adverbials, particles do not enter into syntagmatic
relations with one another to form complexes, or, as is the case for nominals,
phrase-like constructions. If a clause contains two particles, each realises a
different propositional modifying role; they never go together as a single unit
realising a role of this type. One of them is always contained within the scope
of the other, and constitutes a part of the clause within the scope of the second
(see below page 387).
Some particles do occur elsewhere, as constituents of NPs. For example,
the 'subjective' particles thaaddi 'mistakenly believed' and yiganyi 'uncertain' can
be ""nominalised"". This involves a shift from the speaker's subjectivity to the
subjectivity of the actor in the referent situation, thus: thaaddi '(actor) believed
mistakenly' and yiganyi '(actor) was uncertain in the manner in which s/he did
the action'. In this circumstance, the particle yiganyi 'uncertain' (but not thaaddi
'mistakenly believed') occurs as the sole lexical constituent in an NP or ERG PP
(depending on whether the clause is intransitive or not) realising a circumstance
of Manner (section 5.2.3.4). The particle mar/ami 'nothing, without' also occurs
within NPs, usually as a Qualifier or Entity (see examples (6-117) and (6-127),
whilst mangaddi 'not, no' occasionally contains just a single word (or phrase)
within its scope (see example (6-113)).","[149, 150, 151]"

described as constructions of word-level units; and words consist of morphemes,
and are describable as constructions of morphemic units. For example, the clause

(Here, the unanalysed -ari 'he/she/it is' may be regarded as a word
consisting of three morphemes, present tense, third person singular nominative,
and the classifier +I, although it is not possible in this case to uniquely segment
the form- see section 3.9.3.2.4 below.)
The intermediate ranks of phrase and word have been introduced in order to
account for the possibility of branching: in Figure 3-2, in each case in which a131PREUMINARY REMARKSnode is marked (except for the terminal nodes), there is either a branch, or
branching is possible at that point. That is, the function that this constituent
has is realised, or could be realised by a unit with internal structure. (Other
changes - e.g. to the person/number ""agreement"" in the verbal complex may be necessary to preserve grammaticality.) For example, the word waba'smell' in (3-1) realises the function of Process in the phrase of which it is a
constituent, and this may be realised by bimorphemic constructions such as
gard-bi- (hit-IT) 'belt'.
There are, however, certain linguistic units that cannot be placed on the
rank scale. This includes a number of words which may occur directly as
constituents of clauses, and a number of morphemes which occur as phrasal
constituents, without intervening phrase and word nodes respectively. This holds
true for the word mangaddi 'not' in example (3-3), and the morphemes -yooddoo
DU and -jidda ALL in (3-2), and -ngga ERG in (3-3), as is shown in the
constituent analyses of figures 3-3 and 3-4.

bypassed both phrase and word levels. This is because in these instances there is
no possibility of branching between the morpheme level and the next one up:
these morphemes do not enter into syntagms with other morphemes, to form
grammatical words. Because of this, I do not refer to forms such as mangaddi
'not', even though they are free forms, as grammatical words (see also below
section 3.1.2).
We have now identified two types of unit: ranking and non-ranking. It
turns out that, in Gooniyandi, all form items (Matthews 1981:59) are nonranking, and conversely, the majority of non-ranking units are form items. The
only exceptions are the adverbials, which are non-ranking units (section 3.2),
but are not form items. With the exception of adverbials, all non-ranking units
are form items, and must occur in construction with ranking units. The resulting
syntagm is typically a unit of the same rank as the ranking unit (as is the case
in the preceding two examples above) - although sometimes it does not
constitute a unit at all (see below section 3.8).
One further qualification is necessary: certain clauses may consist only of a
single morpheme, usually an interjection - e.g. yoowayi 'yes' (see below
3.10). Evidently these are ""minor"" clauses, and might reasonably be placed off
the rank scale: they never have internal structure. In this case ""clause"" and
""morpheme"" coincide.
There are two main ways in which trees can become more complicated.
Firstly, as Figures 3-3 and 3-4 show, embedding is possible. In these particular
examples the embedded unit is of the same rank as the unit it is embedded in.
However, rankshifting (Huddleston 1965:45) - which is a special type ofPRELIMINARY REMARKS133embedding in which the unit embedded is of higher rank than the unit in which
it is embedded - is also possible, albeit rare and of limited productivity in
Gooniyandi (see below 4.1.2.1 and 5.5). The maximum depth of embedding
attested in my corpus is three, as in the following configuration:
PPA pNPA (N)ppA
NP1P1Here NP 1 cannot have another phrase embedded within it (see section 4.2).
Furthermore, when the embedding also involves rankshifting, the maximum
depth appears to be one: if a unit of higher rank is embedded under a unit of
lower rank, then no unit can be embedded within the embedded unit
The second complication is that units (typically of the same rank) may
form syntagms that are not units of the next highest rank. For instance,
(3-4) garndiwiddi yoowooloo yoowarni goornboo
two
man
one
woman
'two men and one woman'consists of two phrases, [garndiwiddi yoowooloo] 'two men' and [yoowarni
goornboo] 'one woman', each of which has the characteristic structure of an NP.
The structure of the whole is clearly not that of an NP - it cannot be described
in terms of the functions identified for the NP (see section 4.1.2.1), although its
two constituents can be. Neither is it a clause. Constructions such as these will
be referred to as complexes, following Huddleston (1965). There are, in
Gooniyandi, word complexes, phrase complexes and clause complexes; in
addition, certain complexes of words and phrases occur. (It is also possible that
there are morpheme complexes.)3.1.2Types of wordIt is necessary to distinguish four different types of word in Gooniyandi. Firstly
there is the phonological word, which is as described in the previous chapter. A
second type of word is the grammatical word- abbreviated g-word- which is
a grammatical unit of word rank; that is, it is the smallest unit that can have
constituency structure. This unit was introduced in the previous subsection.","[115, 116, 117, 118]"
"THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION321into a number of difficulties. These relate to the fact that it is the morphological
shapes of the phrases referring to the participants that define the significant
'transitivity' features of the Gooniyandi clause. The forms and combinations of
forms of the pronominal prefixes and enclitics do not do this. This will become
clear shortly. Furthermore, the absence of the major inherent participant roles
may be accounted for under the assumption that they have been ellipsed (see
section 5.3.1).
(4) Occasionally another bi-valent clause type occurs in which the inherent roles
are realised by an ERG PP and a LOC PP, the latter being paired with the
oblique pronominal enclitic. E.g.:
(5-61) nganyi -ngga tkldda -ya yoowangiraa
-nhi
I
ERG dog
LOC I:exercise:caution of:it
'I'm afraid of the dog.' (i.e. I act cautiously with respect to it)
(5-62) ngaaddi jirigi -ya ngiddlimi -nhi
stone bird LOC I:threw:it at:it
'I threw a stone at the bird.'
In all such cases there exists an agnate clause in which a DAT PP occurs instead
of the LOC: thadda-yoo (dog-DAT) 'for the dog' andjirigi-yoo (bird-DAT) 'for
the bird' could have occurred instead of thadda-ya (dog-LOC) 'at the dog' and
jirigi-ya (bird-LOC) 'at the bird' in (5-61) and (5-62) respectively. The exact
meaning contrast between the two modes of expression remains unclear, and
would appear to lie in the way the situation is viewed, rather than (necessarily)
in differences in the extra-linguistic reality referred to.
The four clause types identified above may be referred to as the transitivity
types in Gooniyandi: the distinctions are concerned with the ""direction"" of the
action. This is a highly abstract system of meaning, the features of which
contextualise in different ways depending on the 'semantic type' of the clause
(see page 326 below).
Transitivity has traditionally been regarded as a feature of verbal lexemes. It has
been claimed that in most Australian languages every verbal root is specifically
categorised as either transitive or intransitive, and changes in transitivity must be
marked by the presence of a derivational affix (Dixon 1980:278). This is not the
case in Gooniyandi. Many, if not most verbal roots occur in more than one of the
four transitivity types. For example, the verb mila- 'see, look at' occurs in each of
them:
(5-63) nganyi milangiri
I
!:see
'I am looking.'","[304, 305]"

THE CLAUSE5.1 Introductory remarks
This chapter investigates the structure and semantics of the Gooniyandi clause,
which as mentioned in section 3.1.1, is the highest ranking grammatical unit in
the language.
The internal constituency structure of the clause is analysed in sections 5.2
to 5.4. Clauses are realised as syntagms of units which may be of phrase rank
(that is, units of the types identified in the preceding chapters, NPs, PPs and
VPs); or by non-ranking morphemes, adverbials and particles (section 3.1.2); or
complexes of ranking and non-ranking units (as described in 4.3.1 and 4.3.2
above). However, as is the case for NPs (see section 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.1), a
description of clauses in terms of the classes of the constituent units and their
linear sequences does not take us very far. It is impossible to provide a general
description of the clause in these terms alone; the functions of the units within
the units of which they are immediate constituents (in this case clauses) must be
taken into account (cf. page 253 above).
As argued in section 3.1.1, constituents are linguistic signs, and to each
constituent form is associated a function, its role in the unit of which it is an
immediate constituent. It seems that, as Halliday has suggested is the case in
English (cf. e.g. Halliday 1970 and 1985), there are in Gooniyandi three primary
types of function that a clausal constituent may bear, each of which conttibutes
a distinct constituency structure to the clause. These primary functions, or
metafunctions, are the ideational, textual and interpersonal (Halliday 1985:xiii).
(a) The IDEATIONAL meaning of a linguistic element is its expression of
""content"". This type of meaning is of two types. One relates to the
representation of the world of experience, including phenomena in it; this is
EXPERIENTIAL meaning. The other concerns the 'logical' relations that are
imputed to lie between these referent phenomena, or the propositions, or parts of
propositions, that express them; this is LOGICAL meaning. Experiential
· meaning of the clause is discussed in section 5.2.",[275]
"5.3.2 Thematisation
The other major component in the textual metafunction, thematisation, has the
clause or clause complex (see sections 5.6.2.1.3 and 5.6.2.2 below) as its
domain. The THEME in Gooniyandi, as in English, is indicated by position: it
occurs first in the clause. From this perspective, the clause has the structure
Theme""Rheme. Since the Theme is frequently chosen from the register of given
information (cf. Halliday 1970:162, Dan~ 1974:114ff), it is prone to ellipsis.
There are thus a number of apparent exceptions to the ordering generalisation. I
will return to this point below. In the meantime, attention will be restricted to
clauses with explicit Themes.
The term 'theme' as it is commonly employed in both Praguean and
systemic theories has two main senses. It can mean (i) the starting point or the
point of departure of what the speaker has to say, and (ii) the subject matter,
what the speaker is talking about (cf. Halliday 1967:212, and Dane~ 1974:113).
These two senses sometimes coincide, and sometimes do not. For instance, the
first clause in the reply of B in (5-223) below has Theme jamoondoo 'other day',
which serves as a convenient ""peg"" on which to pin the clause - and indeed the
whole of the reply. The speaker was not, however, talking about the other day.
(5-223) A: niyaji gawi ngoorndoo -ga ngangginggi

woman
he:went this
A: 'Who gave you this fish?'
B: The woman who we saw the other day going fishing gave it
to me.'
The Theme of the third clause of B's reply, goornboo 'woman', is thematic in
the second sense: it is what the clause - in fact the whole utterance - is about
Another type of Theme found in Gooniyandi is illustrated in
(5-224) goomboo manili thigi
woman nose
short
The woman has a short nose.'
(5-225) yoowooloo yingi jawalyi
man
name [subsection term]
The man is of the jawalyi subsection.'
These clauses consist of three NPs, each one word in length. (The first two
words do not constitute an NP together- see page 253 above.) The second and
third words (also phrases) together constitute characterising clauses, the second
word (!phrase) being characterised by the third. The first word (!phrase) however
bears no experiential role in the clause. But rather it establishes a starting point,
a 'frame' within which the main predication holds (cf. Chafe 1976:50). I will
refer to Themes of this type as Topics, following Chafe (1976).1t is the second
word (/phrase) in each case that the clause is really 'about'; this constituent
constitutes a second Theme for the clause.
Topics typically establish an owner or possessor of a thing bearing some
experiential role in the clause. Where the possession is alienable, as in (5-226) a
possessive pronominal referring to the owner is required in the NP referring to
the possessed entity.
(5-226) ngaddagi ngaddanyi I ngaja
nhoowoo I
my
mother
brother his
ng~inyaanyilmy
uncle
'My mother's brother is my uncle.'
topicalisation is also used to establish a location, with respect to which a second
location is established. For example,THE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE373(5-227) mayaroo Quanbun I niyi -nhingi -ngga lilinggaa
house
that ABL1 ERG west
birndiddi -ya I gardbini I
plane
LOC he:hit:hlm
'To the west of Quanbun homestead, on the plain, he killed him.'
Topicalisation is frequently used where embedding would be used in
English. In examples such as (5-226) either embedding or topicalisation may be
used in Gooniyandi, although the latter predominates. But where the depth of
embedding is greater, topicalisation only can be used (see above page 281.)
The Topic is a particular type of Theme, one which bears no experiential
role in the clause in which it occurs. Instead, it has some experiential role in a
phrasal IC of the clause; that is, in some experiential role within the clause.
This phrase is typically (as in examples (5-226) and (5-227) above) thematic in
the clause, in the sense that is is what the clause is about. Thus, in the
topicalisation pattern there are two distinct types of Theme, the Topic and the
Theme proper. The former invariably precedes the latter. The second Theme, or
the Theme proper, is enabled by, or is established by the Topic.
It seems that Topics do not necessarily enable or establish Themes, although they
normally do. In
(5-228) ngooddoo -yoo yoowooloo garingi ngirndaji
that
DAT man

nhoowoo thodda

This is that man's wife's dog',
the Topic ngooddooyoo yoowoo/oo garingi 'that man's wife' enables the Rheme,
nhoowoo thadda 'her dog'. Compare also (4-82) above - in this example the
enabled PP may, however, be interpreted as a second Theme (see below pages 378379).","[355, 356, 357]"
"(These terms are used following Halliday 1970/1976:167 and 1985:113.) In
(5-1), ngaddagi thangarndi 'my language' is the Identified, and Gooniyandi the
Identifier. It should be noted, however, that the same clause could also be used to
identify the language Gooniyandi: had I been a newcomer requesting information
about the language, the speaker could have identified it as his language - this
would have narrowed down the field of potential referents.
As has been mentioned already, the two NPs provide alternate designations
of a single entity. Where they differ is in their 'mode' of referring: one NP
specifies the form - how the item is to be recognised; the other specifies the
function- how the item is valued (cf. Halliday 1985:115). For example~ (5-1)
identifies the speaker's language (function) by name (form) thereby indicating
how it is to be recognised. Following Halliday (1985:115) I use the terms
TOKEN and VALUE respectively~ for the two different modes of referring, form
and function. Unlike the functional roles Identifier and Identified, Token and
Value are uniquely assigned to the constituents of an Identifying clause. The
Token usually corresponds to the nominal constituent which is most lexically
specific; the Value corresponds with the nominal constituent which is least
lexically specific. In terms of our example above, Gooniyandi is more specific
than thangarndi 'language', so Gooniyandi is the Token (form), and thangarndi
'language' the Value (function).
The NPs in an identifying clause simultaneously realise one of the roles
Identifier/Identified, and one of the roles TokenNaloe. The choices are
independent, thus giving rise to two distinct types of identifying clause:
DECODING identifying clause, in which the Identified is associated with the
Value, Identifier with the Token; and ENCODING, in which the Identified is
associated with the Token, the Identifier with the Value (Halliday 1968:202).
Each of the four feature combinations may occur initially - i.e. each may
realise the textual function of Theme (see section 5.3.2). The possibilities are
set out below, with examples:
Identifier/Token
Identified/Value
(5-2) ngaddagi thangarndi

'My language is Gooniyandi.'",[279]
"It has been mentioned already that stress does not cross the boundary
between the stem and the CC, when sequences such as i-yi occur (see page 64
above). However, when the {w} of the present tense prefix -wi+ is lost
following a vowel (but not when it is lost following a [+continuant]), the initial
vowel of the CC and the final vowel of the verbal stem coalesce. In this case, it
appears that the CC forms a single phonological word with the immediately
preceding unit. For example,{mila -wi

THE WORD3.1 Preliminary remarks
3.1.1 Grammatical outline
The primary notion which will be invoked in this book to explain the
grammatical patterns in Gooniyandi is that of constituency. It will be assumed
that constituents are linguistic signs; that is, they are characterised by both their
form and their meaning. Consequently their identification is dependent not just
on formal criteria, but also on concurrent identification of their meaning, where,
by the 'meaning' of a constituent I refer to its function in the whole of which it
is a part (cf. Haas 1954:80). For example, ngooddoo 'that' is a constituent of
ngooddoo yoowooloo 'that man', and functions as the Deictic within the full
phrase (see 4.1.2.1 below). This function must be distinguished from the lexical
meaning of the word ngooddoo 'that'. This approach to constituency division
contrasts sharply with immediate constituent analysis, in which cuts are
generally assumed to be binary, and in which constituents need not fulfil
functions in the whole of which they constitute a part (cf. Halliday 1985:22ff).
It is a type of 'string constituent analysis' (Longacre 1960), in which the
constituents are labeled by their function. In this section I will represent
constituency in terms of trees, usually with unlabeled nodes. Later on, when the
functional labels become important, I will also use Chinese box diagrams.
A general account of the shape of constituency trees in Gooniyandi is
possible if a constituency hierarchy or 'rank scale' (Halliday 1961/1976:58) is
recognised. The proposed rank scale for this language is shown in Figure 3-1.
The immediate constituents of a 'unit' (Halliday 1961/1976) of a given
rank are typically units of the rank immediately below on the scale. A unit of
one of the three highest ranks may be described as a syntagm of units of
immediately lower rank. Clauses consist of phrases, and may be described as
constructions of phrase-level units; phrases consist of words, and may be..","[113, 114, 115]"
"5.6.2.2.3 Enhancement
Here the relationship between the subordinate clause and the constituent it
modifies is a circumstantial one of place. That is, the thing referred to by the
modified constituent (either a nominal phrase, or an adverbial) fulfils a
circumstantial role of location in the enhancing clause; by contrast, in extension
(5.6.2.2.1) the thing fulfils a participant role in the extending clause, or is a part
of a participating entity. The clausal constituent modified may be either a
nominal phrase (NP or PP), or a spatial adverbial, referring to (or implying) a443CLAUSE COMPLEXESplace. The enhancing clause (like the extending clause discussed above) always
occurs in final position in the clause complex, typically next to the constituent
of the primary clause that it modifies. That is, the qualified referent is normally
new, and the unmarked focus of the primary clause - and as such it always
finds overt realisation in that clause. (It is of course normally ellipsed in the
following enhancing clause.) Furthermore, the enhancing clause is inv~bly in
the factive mood. This clause always occurs in final position in the clause
complex, usually next to the modified constituent in the primary clause. An
example is

Note that, as (5-429) demonstrates, the role borne by the modified
constituent in the main clause need not be a circumstantial one.

5.6.2.2.4 Concluding remarks
We have seen that as a rule the elaborating clause and the subclausal constituent
it modifies (in case it is not ellipsed) are as a rule immediately next to one
another. They might be regarded as juxtaposed; however, the two do not together
form a unit complex, as is the case in other juxtapositions. The clause either
precedes the constituent it modifies, or follows it. These possibilities appear to
be another reflection of Bolinger's (1967) distinction between referent and
reference modification (discussed above, section 4.1.2.2). As was the case within444THE CLAUSEthe NP, material preceding the referring expression (in the primary clause) serves
to modify its reference, whilst material following it serves to modify the

To conclude this discussion of clause complexes I will briefly enquire into
the linguistic status of the above relationships, addressing the question as toClAUSE COMPLEXES445whether the types merely interpretations engendered by the context, and have. no
linguistic significance (cf. Hale 1976:86, and McKay 1988). I will look atthe
tactic relationships frrst, then at the logico-semantic ones.
In all clause types identified in the table, one clause, the PRIMARY clause;
carries the main burden of the message. The other clause(s) carry less important
information, and will be referred to as SECONDARY clauses. Parataxis and
hypotaxis may be distinguished in terms of the order relationships that may
obtain between the primary and secondary clauses.
In clause complexes of the types listed in the frrst column of Table 5-2,
the primary clause is the one which comes frrsl In enhancement, the enhancing
clause, which always comes second, expresses a situation secondary to the
situation enhanced upon. (Where the situations are temporally successive, the
most important one is the one occurring frrst: in general, the occurrence of the
second is dependent on the occurrence of the frrst. Furthermore, I would argue
that the fact that the clauses are conjoined indicates that the speaker does evaluate
the event frrst to occur as the most important; otherwise, s/he could have chosen
to use two isolated clause-sentences.) In the case of addition, as in English, the
first clause expresses the situation that the speaker evaluates as the most
important: in (5-366) the most important part of the message concerns getting
the hearer to do something. Similar remarks apply to the other relations of in
the parataxis column. At frrst sight it may appear that in identification the
opposite order occurs, i.e. that the secondary precedes the primary clause: here
the identifying clause, which corresponds to relative clauses in languages such as
English, always occurs first. But closer examination of the facts shows that this
type does not in fact contradict the ordering principle. This type typically occurs
in the context in which the identifying clause carries the new infonnation, and
the following clause carries given information. Consider for example (5-223)
above, in which the final clause of B's response is information given in A's
question.
It is clear that in clause complexes of the types listed in the second column
of Table 5-2, the primary clause is always the one in unmarked (or indicative)
mood; the secondary clause is always the one in a marked non-indicative mood.
Here clause order has nothing to do with the primary/secondary opposition;
where reversal of the order of the clauses is possible, it does not change the
status of the clauses as primary or secondary. This suggests the inherent
secondary status of clauses in non-indicative moods in these types of clause
complex. The clauses are of unequal status. On the other hand, the fact that
reversal of clauses in complexes from the first column of the table induces a446THE ClAUSEchange in the relative status of the clauses indicates their equal footing. This
justifies the distinction between parataxis and hypotaxis.
Turning now to the logical relationships, we fmd that in hypotactic clause
complexes the enhancing relationship of location may be distinguished from the
others by virtue of the fact that the order of clauses is fixed in the former, but
not in the latter relationships. In location, the subordinate clause always follows
the main clause; in the other hypotactic types, the subordinate clause more often
than not precedes the main clause. Condition is morphologically distinct from
identification and time, except in the future tense, where both condition and time
are realised by a subjunctive clause (I will return to this shortly). Identification
and time can be distinguished as follows: if there is, initial in the main clause,
an endophoric word referring to (and/or summarising) the subordinate clause, it
must be a determiner in identification, and the adverbial miga 'thus, in thus
manner' in time. In other words, identification and time are sometimes formally
distinct, and are in principle distinguishable. Similarly, it should be possible to
distinguish future temporals from future conditionals by the endophoric element
that may occur initially in the main clause. And it seems that only temporals
allow the adverbial miga 'thus, in thus manner'. The discussion of this paragraph
shows that the logical types in hypotaxis identified in the previous section have
linguistic validity as covert categories: they are distinguishable by agnation, and
not by form alone.
Things are not so clear for the various types of paratactic complexes, and it
is beyond the scope of this book to determine whether each of the logical types
identified above are linguistically significant. I will merely remark on the
statuses of constituent descriptives, constituent identification, and clausal
temporal inclusion. Identification stands out from the other paratactic
relationships by virtue of the fact that one of the endophoric determiners may
come initially in the secondary clause, and refer to the thing identified by the
primary clause. It would seem that constituent descriptives and clauses related by
temporal inclusion overlap, but do not coincide: clause complexes admitting the
latter interpretation admit the former only if the clauses share a nominal
constituent. Furthermore, neither of these two types appears to display a
linguistic property distinguishing them from clausal addition.
But constituent identification in parataxis stands out from the remaining
paratactic relations in other ways. Identification is the only logical relationship
common to both parataxis and hypotaxis. Indeed, paratactic identification may be
grouped together with hypotactic identification, conditionals, and temporals, in
terms of textual structure. In each of these the expanding clause typically comesCLAUSE COMPLEXES447first, and would appear to function as a type of thematic clause in the complex,
establishing a thing involved in, a place at which, a time when, or a condition
under which the situation referred to by the primary clause did or may occur. The
thing established may be referred to by an initial endophoric element in the
following, main clause. This makes the construction reminiscent of the thematic
option of reprise (cf. above page 375, and Grimes 1975). As we have seen, such
initial subordinate clauses always occur on their own, typically fall-rise;
intonation contour. This may be compared with the rising tone on reprised nonclausal themes (page 374 above).
For each of the types identified in the preceding paragraph, final position
for the expanding clause is far less frequent, and this clause may reasonably be
regarded as a type of afterthought, added to clarify an omitted (or ellipsed) theme;
the tone typically falls throughout, and is usually lower than the tone of the
primary clause. Thus, as suggested above, the two types of constituent
elaboration, characterisation and clarification, are merely thematic variants of
identification. The subordinate types are typically added when the theme is
something which has gone before, or is a presupposition, but which the speaker
ascertains the hearer may have difficulty in identifying; the paratactic type adds
new information of a peripheral nature. The four types, paratactic constituent
elaboration, hypotactic constituent elaboration, hypotactic conditionals, and
hypotactic temporals, may be grouped together and distinguished from the
remaining types by virtue of their possession of a theme-rheme structure. They
are thus in a sense more tightly structured, and more clause-like than the other
types.
It is now clear that a number of the types distinguished in the above
discussion do in fact have linguistic significance. This was shown by (1) formal
differences in the choice of moods and resuming determiners; (2) differences in
the significance of clause order; and (3) the fact that the class of complex
sentences allowing a particular interpretation differs from the class allowing
another interpretation. It remains true that many particular clause complex
tokens are multiply ambiguous. Presumably the interpretations are influenced by
the context of the text and the speech situation in which the particular complex
occurs. To take one example, (5-430) occurred in a context in which my
collaborator and I were discussing the previous work on the Gooniyandi
language. No previous mention had been made of this particular white person.

'Nthe whiteman put (Gooniyandi) words on paper and died.'
In this context, the first two interpretations are the most likely. Since the white
person had not yet been mentioned, the speaker might have intended that the frrst
clause establish such an individual, and mention as a further observation that
this man had died (in fact, the speaker was wrong here). Alternatively, he may
not have intended that the person be established in this way, but his identity left
indefinite, the point of the utterance being that although someone had previously
worked on the language, this was quite a while ago. If, however, the discourse
had been concerned with the exploits of a particular white person, the third
reading would be the most likely one. Naturally there are formal correlates of the
discourse and speech situation factors, showing up in the order of words in the
constituent clauses, whether or not they are ellipsed, etc. (cf. Merlan
1981:188ff). We cannot here attempt to identify factors influencing the
interpretations of particular examples.","[426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432]"
"..
PRONOMINALS1673.6 Pronominals
The category of person is realised in a number of different places and ways in the
grammar of Gooniyandi. Within the VP it is realised by bound morphemes,
which occur either as prefixes to the classifier complex, or as enclitics to the
entire verb phrase (see section 3.9.3.6). Elsewhere, it is realised by free words,
and in a set of two possessive suffixes to kin-tenus (see section 3.12.2.1). With
two minor exceptions (see pages 225 and 234 below) the system is constant
throughout, distinguishing three persons (first, second and third), two numbers
(singular and non-singular) and what I will refer to as a restricted/unrestricted
opposition in the first person non-singular.
The restricted category in the first person non-singular encompasses the
traditional categories of first person dual inclusive, dual exclusive, and plural
exclusive, whilst the unrestricted category corresponds to the first person plural
inclusive. In other words, the inclusive/exclusive distinction is maintained only
in the plural; it disappears in the dual. The unrestricted category always includes
the speaker, the hearer, and at least one other person; the restricted category
excludes one of the non-speakers. Using the symbolism S =speaker, H = hearer,
and 0 = other(s), and assuming that S and H can refer to a single individual
only, while 0 may refer to any number of others, the restricted and unrestricted
categories may be distinguished as follows:
Restricted
UnrestrictedsH0+
+a-a++where a can be either+ or-, -a having the reverse polarity. Equivalently, we
could describe the restricted category as S & (H v 0), where 'v' signifies
disjunctive or; and the unrestricted category as S & H & 0.
To the best of my knowledge, pronominal systems resembling the Gooniyandi
one have not been reported in any other language, from Australia or elsewhere.
Among the neighbouring languages, those from the Pama-Nyungan family which includes Walmajarri (Hudson 1978:85), Jaru (Tsunoda 1981:64ff), and
Wangkajunga (my own fieldnotes)- and the Worrorran family- e.g. Ungarinyin
(Rumsey 1982b:31) - make the usual inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first
person non-singular. In the Jarrakan languages Kija (my fieldnotes) and
Miriwoong (Kofod 1978:47), this distinction is at least optional. However, all of
the languages of the Nyulnyulan family (traditionally located to the west of
Gooniyandi and Bunuba) show a quite different system, which distinguishes four
persons 1, 1/2, 2, and 3, and, depending on the language, two or three numbers,
minimal, augmented and, where three numbers are distinguished, unit augmented
(Stokes 1982:151ff).","[151, 152]"
"34INTRODUCTIONan intcractant in the situation might make. In this way the possible senses of
!he English prompt are relatively restricted and there is a better .ch~ce that the
linguist and the native speaker were referring to the same sttuattons, from
similar viewpoints.
Formally elicited utterances can never be completely deco~textu.alised, ~d all
sorts of speakers' behaviour indicated that they did no~ pe:cetve elt~er th~~ o_wn
or my utterances as isolated. For instance, frequent swttchmg of toptc, ehcttatwn
of paradigms, and requests for implausible utterances (such as 'you died') were
frequently met with by resistance such as boredom, and, less frequently. re~sal to
produce the requested form. More interestingly, the entities I established m my
English prompts were treated as belonging to the participant-register of the
discourse, and where possible, treated as ""given"" (Halliday 1970: 162). Speakers
did not like being forced to translate the English NPs verbatim (see also below
page 251 and section 5.3.1). It is clear that speakers regarded the elicitation
process as text-producing, and their responses were characteristic of genres
appropriate to the referential content. Much of the formally elicited data is, then,
in a sense controlled, or constructed text, rather than isolated, decontextualised
sentences. The primary thrust of elicitation was to develop and construct such
contexts as might not frequently arise in conditions where recording was possible.
Because elicitation is text-producing, and because many morphemes and
morpheme combinations are unlikely to arise in free texts, I do not even aspire to
Heath's (1984:4) ideal of a ""corpus-based grammar"" (where 'corpus' includes free
!t•xts only). Although I am mindful of the many dangers inherent in using elicited
materials. I cannot concur with Heath's assessment that he had "" ... no confidence
whatever in such data, since my own early ""data"" of this type often turned out to
be: seriously wrong"" (Heath 1984:5). As I will discuss later, I feel that this
mtsrepresents the nature of linguistic data, by taking it to be an observable
Clbject, independent of the observer.
By far the most problematic aspects of elicitation seem to me to relate to
the practices of seeking speakers' judgements of utterance acceptability (see
~low), and their intuitions and explanations of meaning differences. In the
mcumstances of ~y field:vork these did not prove to be very satisfactory field
~etho~s. and I av?t~ed !herr usc as much as possible. As a rule, in those instances
~~ W~tch two dtshnct forms might conceivably refer to the same referent
Sltuauon, speakers were unable to pin-point the subtle distinctions in meaning

~rogram~ne m the Yiyili Community School (see section 1.8), I had
c pponu~1ty to ca:efully check my transcriptions of a number of words, and my
P~~l~t'm 1.~ ~nalys1s. Careful.auention was paid to 'problem areas', especially: (I)
dtsttngmshmg between ap1co-alveolar, apico-postalveolar and lamino-dental

have. fm:nd that the phonetic contrasts in Gooniyandi are not as perceptible to
the English car as are tlle phonetic contrasts between the corresponding segmentsDATA USED IN THIS INVESTIGATION35in some other Australian languages); and (2) the question of whether the cont.rnst
between apico-alveolars and apico-postalveolars is neutralised word initia1ly (as
it is in many Australian languages). Many words were checked with more than
one speaker, and over more than one repetition (successively and on different
occasions), using both auditory and visual evidence. From this work, I produced
a dictionary of about I 000 items, the phonemic representation of which I am
relatively confident. This dictionary, which includes all items of Hale's 100 word
list, the relevant items of Douglas (1959/1977), as well as all words from the
texts chosen for the school book, and a number of 'suspicious' and crucial words,
is the primary data base for the statistical analysis of phoneme distributions
(section 2.2.5).
The investigation into tlw textual organisation of the clause (section 5.3),
as well as a significant part of the study of the clause complex (section 5.6), is
based primarily on textual material. (Initial hypotheses were, however,
formulated on the basis of the elicited corpus.) From a large corpus of twenty or
more hours of recorded texts, fifteen texts were selected for close scrutiny; three
of these appear in Appendix I. These fifteen texts, which were chosen more or
less at random- and not for any reac;ons of their merit as coherent texts- are
monologues encompassing all genres represented in the corpus. There is no
reason to b~lieve that they are not typical representatives of their genres. They
were narrated by three different individuals, including the youngest and the oldest
speakers. The chosen texts vary in length from about a minute and a half to over
ten minutes, in all totaling about forty-five minutes. Altogether there are alXlllt
800 clauses. The texts had been transcribed word for word in the field with the
assistance of the speaker; most had also been worked over on at least one
occasion with another native speaker. I studied them again away from the field,
attempting to identify and mark in significant suprascgmental features, which I
was convinced played an important role in the organisation of the text as a
message bearing unit (sec section 5.3).
The reader will notice that no sentences are starred as unacceptable or
ungrammatical in this grammar. The present description is based entirely on
occurring, and ipso facto acceptable, sentences. Problems in eliciting acceptance
or rejection of conslructed examples arc well known, and I will not go into them
here- but see for example Bolinger (1968), Christie (1980), Haas (1973), and
Quirk and Svartvik (1966). Suffice it to make Lhe following three observations,
specific to the context of my research. Firstly, speakers were as a rule unwilling
to label utterances I produced a<> unacceptable - rather than respond to the actual
form of my utterance, they almost invariably presumed that I intended to express36INTRODUCTIONsome meaning, and attempted to determine and respond appropriately to that.
And secondly, on the other hand, in more than one instance in which a speaker
had firmly rejected an invented example, he later used the same construction
himself. The reasons for the initial rejection always remained unclear to me.
Finally, my theoretical purpose is not, and was not, to delimit the class of
grammatical sentences (if indeed such a class is well defined - cf. Hocketl
1967), but rather to describe and account for the meaning potential of
Gooniyandi utterances.","[46, 47, 48, 49]"

"1.4.2 Social organisation
In Gooniyandi culture as in other Aboriginal cultures, interpersonal and
intergroup rights, obligations, duties and behaviour were, and still are, to a large
extent determined by ""kin"" relationships. The 'kindred' is perceived as
coterminous with society. And, partly because of this, the kin-relation between a
pair of individuals is usually to some extent negotiable, and not as fixed by
actual genealogy as it is for Westerners.
Gooniyandi has a sizeable system of kin-terms. There are over twentyGOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIEfY13unmarked or simple kin-terms, all of which are used in both reference and address
(there are no morphologically distinct vocative forms). These may be suffixed
with one of two possessor indicating morphemes -wa 'his/her' and -badi 'yours'
(number of the possessed is not indicated). There are no forms for other
possessors, such as first person or third person non-singular; these must be
indicated by a possessive pronoun. There is also a suffix -langi which forms
dyadic terms. When added to the appropriate simple term, it refers to a group of
two or more individuals in the designated kin-relation to one another. In addition
to the simple kin-terms, there is a small set of 'triangular' terms, which indicate
the relation of both the speaker and a distinct propositus, usually the addressee,
to the referent. (For a discussion of triangular terms, see McConvell 1982 and
Laughren 1982.) The system of triangular terms is restricted to configurations in
which at least one of the relationships is affinal. Some of the distinctions made
in tltc simple system are neutralised in this system.
The Gooniyandi kinship system is a variant of the Arremte (Aranda) type
(Radcliffe-Brown 1931), in which four kinds of kin are distinguished in the
grand-parental generation (cf. Scheffler 1978: chapter 9). In Aranda systems, two
different types of cross-cousin are usually distinguished terminologically: first
cross-cousin, and second cross-cousin, the latter being a prescribed spouse of
Ego, and designated 'spouse'. In Gooniyandi, however, certain cross-cousins are
designated goorndi (females) and goornda (males), which terms also apply to first
cross-cousins (i.e. FZCh and MBCh), and marriage was proscribed. The first
choice of spouse is from the same subsection as the actual MMBDCh and
FMBSCh (provided the marriages were all first preference - see below).
However, s/he must be distant from Ego: a classificatory and not an actual crosscousin. Speakers explained this to me in geographical terms: marriage with a
classificatory second cross-cousin living in a distant place would be acceptable,
whereas marriage wilh a second cross-cousin residing nearby would be
unacceptable. This may perhaps suggest a predilection for local group exogamy.
(Compare Elkin 1938/1974:101 and Rumsey 1982a:161-162.) Summing up,
genealogy (or imputed genealogy) is not the only factor determining the kinterms actually used in particular speaker-referent-(proposilus) situations.
Distance, which is likely to be a more complex factor than mere geographical
distance (see Rumsey 1982a;162), is also taken into account.
Genealogy and distance may conflict, and the present evidence indicates that
such conflicts need not be definitely resolved one way or the other once and for
all. Rather, where there is such a conflict, the choice of kin-term applied (and
presumably also the interpersonal behaviour) may depend on context. For14INTRODUCTIONexample, in formal elicitation sessions, not surprisingly, genealogy is the main
factor determining choice of kin-term and defining appropriate behaviour, while
distance plays a subsidiary role. In other contexts, such as speaking of initiation,
distance may emerge as the pivotal factor. For instance, in speaking of his own
initiation, my main teacher referred to the men of the jawandi subsection, who
he would normally call ngaboo 'father', as nyaanyi 'mother's brother, etc.'. This
was because they were his mother's countrymen, and thus her brothers, not her
spouses. (When questioned about this in a later elicitation session, my teacher
denied ever calling ajawandi man nyaanyi!)
Elkin (1938/1974:103) distinguishes another system, the Alurija (Luritja)
system, in which there is a merging of cross-cousins with siblings: in this
system the cross-cousin of Ego's M and F are called by the same term as their
siblings, MZ, MB and FZ, FB respectively. This is precisely the merging found
in the Gooniyandi system, when the distance is small. Moreover, there is
occasional merging of cross-cousin and sibling. In one case I encountered, two
individuals who should have called one another goornda, preferred to use ngaja
'younger brother'- their mothers were countrywomen, and hence sisters. (Note
that actual MMBD becomes a ngaddanyi 'mother', and so her children become
siblings: these cross-cousins are always treated as siblings.)
These two factors, genealogy and distance, are by no means the only ones
that may be relevant in a particular socio-cultural circumstance. To give one
example, the opposition of generation levels- same or alternate vs. adjacentis important in the context of disposal of the dead. As there is no term for
alternate generation sets in Gooniyandi, those of the same generation as the dead
are referred to as marna-wa (older:brother-his) 'his (older) brother'. the others as
joogoo-wa (child-his) 'his children'.
The Gooniyandi social universe - including everyone they have close
social interaction with -is divided into eight classes which anthropologists call
subsections, the terms for which are shown in Table 1-1.
The subsections are referred to in the local form of Aboriginal English and
English based varieties as ""skins"", and in Gooniyandi as gooroo. The subsection
system is today found over a large geographical area, including the southern
Kimberley and much of the Northern Territory. The terms are strikingly similar,
sometimes even identical, over quite large areas (McConvell 1985a:66).
There are distinct terms for the males and females of each subsection, the
terms being in most instances transparent cognates. The male terms all have an
initialjV, while the female terms have initial nV or nyV, where the vowel V,
which must be either /a/ or /oo/, is usually identical with the vowel of the15GOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIETY-Table 1-I: The subsections

"CHAPTER 6
TOPICS IN SEMANTICS
6.1 Preliminary remarksThis chapter is a preliminary investigation into the semantics of certain closed
class units, in particular, logical modifiers (section 6.2), enclitics (section 6.3),
particles (section 6.4), and the major categories of the finite verb (section 6.5).
Up to now these morphemes have been given approximate English glosses
only. Other closed class items including stem forming suffixes,
postpositions, pronominals, and infinitives- have already been discussed in
Chapter 3 above.
As in the previous chapters, the object of study is the linguistic sign, a
form-meaning correlation. Meaning, as we have seen (see page 323) must be
distinguished from reference, or the extra-linguistic ""reality"" referred to by a
particular utterance or sign in the utterance. Meaning and reference are not
identical; the former imposes a classification on the latter. On the other hand,
reference must be studied in order that linguistic meaning be determined. What is
different about the investigation of this chapter lies primarily in the nature of the
formal aspect of the sign. In Chapters 4 and 5 the forms were immediate
constituents of phrases and clauses - that is, entities with no unique shape in
terms of either their phonological or their lexical expression, and established by
means of contrast and complementary distribution. It is assumed in this chapter
that morphemes, the ultimate linguistic constituents which have meaning, arc
also signs. In this case, of course, the forms we are concerned with are primarily
(morpho)phonological. The sign is an association between a phonological and/or
a morphophonological form and a meaning. Qualifications must, of course, be
made regarding: (i) homophony, in which two distinct signs share a
phonological form; and (ii) allomorphy, in which a single sign has variant
phonological expressions.
The fundamental assumption of the approach to meaning adopted here is,
then, that each formal item or morpheme (with the exception of homonyms) has
associated with it a linguistic meaning which remains constant throughout all of450TOPICS IN SEMANTICSits uses. I will refer to this invariant of meaning as the FORMAL meaning of the
morpheme, following Ellis (1966:80). Other linguists have used terms such as
""core meaning"" (McConvell 1983a), ""grammatical meaning"" (King 1983), and
""common denominator of meaning"" or ""Gesamtbedeutung"" (Jak:obson 1936 and
Waugh 1975). This formal meaning must be distinguished from the various
CONTEXTUAL meanings or interpretations that the morpheme acquires in the
various circumstances of its use. Contextual meanings do not form a part of the
essential meaning carried by a form, and they vary according to its linguistic and
extra-linguistic environment. Of course, a given morpheme is always used in
some context, linguistic and extra-linguistic. And each context will engender a
particular semantic interpretation, which must not, however, be confused with
the meaning inherent in the morpheme, and common to all of its uses (cf.
Waugh 1975:439, and King 1983:113). In order to establish the formal meaning
of a morpheme, ALL of its uses must be examined, and from them a common
denominator of meaning extracted (if possible) on which the various uses are
based.
As King (1983:102) points out, many grammarians have been content to
delineate and catalogue the uses attributable to a particular form. There are,
however, a number of problems and inadequacies with this sort of approach to
semantic description (see King 1983: 103). From the perspective of the present
investigation, the major problem concerns the identification and delimitation of
these meanings. Nothing seems to prevent the proliferation of meanings as more
and more individual examples are taken into account: in this approach all
meanings are accorded equal footing. Furthermore, there is another problem for
the linguist who is not a native speaker of the language in establishing the
intended referential meaning of the utterance (or subpart thereof), and its
connotations. I have already discussed this problem in connection with the field
methodology (see section 1.10). It is clear from that discussion that the pairing
between the initial English prompts and the speaker's responses to them cannot
be regarded as unassailable 'raw' data. Even when the context constrains the
possible interpretations there may still be room for misunderstandings
(especially in the region of non-experiential meanings, which will take up a
significant part of the discussion of this chapter).
Thus the crucial problem with the cataloguing approach is that the only
means of cross-checking and assessing the presence (or absence) of a particular
sense is to elicit a native speaker's reaction and explanation. (And I have already
mentioned practical problems inherent in this methodology, at least in the field
situation where this research was conducted.) However, in the approach I amPREUMINARY REMARKS451advocating here, there is a constant interplay and exchange between the processes
of refining the specification of contextual meanings and encapsulating the formal
meanings. The complete meaning of an utterance or subpart of an utterance can
only be approached by degrees, and this may entail successive modifications to
the interpretation of particular examples, even in some cases the rejection of the
speaker's gloss as inappropriate or inaccurate. Furthermore, examples are not
seen in isolation from other like examples. Rather, by processes of crosschecking and comparison over as large a corpus as possible, significant
contextual meanings can be identified, and proliferation of meanings/uses
avoided. That is, we are more concerned with types of contextual meaning of a
form than with the instantiated and unrepealable meaning tokens in specific
utterances (cf. Ellis 1966:81).
But the establishment of formal meaning requires more than a mere
examination of contextual meanings. As a sign, a morpheme enters into
paradigmatic relations with other signs, and it is the system of such relations
that gives it linguistic 'value' (cf. Saussure 1959/1974:lllff). The formal
meaning of a morpheme cannot be fully determined without an appreciation of
the meanings of the other morphemes with which it enters into oppositions.
This means that minimal pairs and the principle of paradigmatic opposition
within fixed frames must be used in establishing formal meanings, in addition to
the process of abstraction of invariants from contextual meanings. A special case
of this is of importance to the study of a number of the forms dealt with in this
chapter. That is, the contrast between the presence and the absence of the form in
given contexts. Meaning is carried by the absence of a particular sign in a place
where it may occur, and zero in such contexts may also be regarded as a sign
belonging to the paradigmatic set including the former morpheme.
This account sets out to do more than merely assign English glosses to
Gooniyandi morphemes, which glosses are frequently misleading, and have
unintended connotations. An attempt is made to give sharp formulations (and
formalisations) of the formal meanings. This enterprise meets with varying
degrees of success and depth with the various morphemes discussed. The formal
meanings have, in a few instances, been described in terms of systems of feature
oppositions (cf. Waugh 1975, and King 1983). This has been done only for
morphemes which enter into paradigmatic sets, one member of which is
obligatorily chosen in all circumstances of a specified type- see sections 6.5.1
and 6.5.5. Elsewhere, formulae and short descriptions have been used.","[432, 433, 434, 435]"
"5.6.2.1.3 Enhancement
In enhancement, one clause extends the meaning of another by adding to it a newsituation circumstantial to it. Enhancement combines with both of the
syntagmatic relations parataxis and hypotaxis, in contrast with extension andTHE ClAUSE428elaboration which combine with parataxis only. The range of meanings differs
somewhat in each case. In paratactic complexes the second clause enhances on
the first by indicating a circumstance of time, manner or fear. In hypotactic
complexes, the subordinate clause indicates a circumstance of time, condition,
cause, or reason.
5.6.2.1.3.1Parataxis[1] Temporal. The referent situations of the two clauses may be related either
by succession or by temporal inclusion. Only the former relationship may be
explicitly marked morphologically, by means of conjunctions (niyinhingi, 'after
that, then' niyajinhingi 'after this, then'), enclitics (-rni 'then'), and occasionally
adverbials (e.g. ngamoo 'before'). The order of clauses almost always reflects the
order occurrence of the referent situations, regardless of whether or not the
temporal relationship is morphologically marked. The following examples
illustrate the three order possibilities:(5-382) yoowooloo garndiwangooddoo -ngga gardboowooddami
man
many
ERG they:fought:togetherniyi -nhingi nardawooddarnithiddi -nhingi -nggathat ABL
they:cried:together fight ABL
ERG
'Many men fought together and then they cried together
afterwards.'
(Note that niyi-nhingi (that-ABL) 'after that' and niyaji-nhingi (this-ABL) 'after
this' appear to be most frequently used as sentential, rather than as clausal
conjunctions -see the texts.)
(5-383) billycan jidiblimi bahaabiddi -mi mila/a
I:lifted:it inside
SEQ I:saw:it
'I lifted the billycan lid and then looked inside.'
(5-384) ngamoo dagooddwani middi maningga -rni
barngiyi
before it:entered
sun
night
SEQ he:returned
'The sun had already set; he returned in the night time.'
The order of clauses need not reflect the actual order of the situations described:
the individual referred to in (5-384) had already started on his way back when the
sun set. Temporal adverbials in Gooniyandi do not function as clause
connectives; that is, ngamoo 'before' in example (5-384) does not function like
English 'before', in 'before he got back the sun had set.'
Temporal inclusion is not morphologically marked, but the includingCLAUSE COMPLEXESclause always follows the included, giving a temporal location for it:
(5-385) boolga -ngga wardjiwiddangi bidiyooddoo mooyoo
old:man ERG he:went:to:them they:two
sleepbagiwiddi
they:lay
'The old man went up to them as they slept.'
[2] Manner. One clause may enhance the meaning of another by indicating the
manner in which it was done; that is, the former indicates a state or action of the
actor concomitant with his engagement in the latter. For instance,
(5-386) miga
waranggiri barndi -yooddoo dalwooddooyoo
like:that he:sits
arm
DU
they:two:are:extended
'(The diver bird) sits with his wings out'
This is the only circumstance I am aware of in which a Clause from a
clause complex in Gooniyandi may have a characteristic structure, which does
not occur in independent clauses. The first clause of (5-387) describes the
concomitant action of the man's arms, and treats them as Agents (cf. McGregor
1985:218-219). In independent clauses body parts may be non-participant
Instruments only.
(5-387) banuJi -yooddoo -ngga briminbinmarni
waranggtn
arm
DU
ERG they:are:folded:together he:sits
'He's sitting with his arms folded.'
Further evidence of the distinctiveness of the type comes from the fact th@t this
relationship may be expressed instead by a non-fmite clause- compare e~plp
(5-330) above. Manners are not, however, usually marked distinctively: there is
not usually an Adverbial in the first clause making reference to the
circumstantial situation:
(5-388) wardgiri ngiddiwandi widdinywiddinygiri
he:goes across
he:whistles
'He's going across whistling.'
Example (6-99) below compares two situations, and illustrates a second
type of manner, comparison (see above section 5.2.3.4). This is, however, one
of the two examples available of this relation, both of which are incomplete,
showing the enhancing (manner) clause only.
[3] Apprehension. In apprehension, one clause indicates an undesirable430THE CLAUSEconsequence that would result unless the situation referred to by the other clause
occurs. This is expressed in Gooniyandi by means of finite clauses without the
use of a conjunctive element. The clause referring to the undesired situation
always comes after the one referring to the evasive action, and its verb is in the
present tense and definite mode (see section 6.5.3.3 below). For example,(5-389) ngaddagi yamadi
gadlooni ngooddiya nirdganoo -woo
my
coolamon I:left:it there
it:sticks
DEF
-ngaddagi
on:me
'I left my car there lest it got bogged (in the mud).'
(5-390) gamba wardbidda
gamba -winyja rajgidda
-woo
water we:will:take:it water DEP
we:die:of:thirst DEF
'We'll take water with us lest we die of thirst.'
The 'evasive action' may be an action to be avoided:(5-391) mangaddi warangginggira -woo migi -ngga wirdbilingga
not
you:sit
DEF ant
ERG it:bites:you
-woo
DEF
'Don't sit there lest the ants bite you.'
It is clear that the relation between the clauses cannot be interpreted as one
of extension (addition or replacement). Logically, it is a special case of the
relation of disjunctive 'or' (exactly one of the clauses only may be true).
However, it carries the added nuances that the second situation has not yet
occurred, and that its occurrence is undesirable. The suggestion is that the first
should occur in order that the second, undesirable situation does not.
Apprehension may be viewed, then, as a type of purpose (Halliday, pers.
comm.). The modality of the second clause would appear to be viewed from the
perspective of the first. The situation to be evaded is seen as a certainty unless
the avoidance action is undertaken. However, this may not contradict the present
viewpoint: that is, it is assumed that the undesirable consequence has not
occurred as of the time of speaking. (See also section 6.5.3.3 below.)
It should be noted that the relation of apprehension is not SIGNALLED by
the verbal category of the second clause; the present defmite occurs in complexes
of clauses which are not related in this way:ClAUSE COMPLEXES431(5-392) thoolnglimi -nhi

I:kicked
at:him I:missed:him later
I:hit:you · DEF
'(Although) I kicked at him and missed, I'll definitely hit you
shortly.'
There are other expressions having a closely similar meaning. In (5-393)
the second clause, which expresses an undesirable consequence- at least for the
perpetrator of the first action, though presumably not for the hearer- occurs in
the subjunctive future.
(5-393) mangaddi gardbinggooni nganyi -ngga -rni gardjawoolooni
not
he:will:hit:you I
ERG SEQ I:might:hit:him
'He won't hit you lest I hit him in turn.'
[4] Purpose. Here one clause, invariably the second, indicates a purpose or
reason for the occurrence of the first. As the following example shows, there is
no morphological indication of this relationship.
(5-394) wardji doowa -yidda manyi doownga
he:went store ALL food
he:got:it
'He went to the store to get food.'
5.6.2.1.3.2HypotaxisIn hypotaxis, the only way one clause may expand on another is by
enhancement. There are two types: [1] CONDffiONAL, realised by a subordinate
clause in the subjunctive mood (section 6.5.4.1); and [2] TEMPORAL, realised by
a subordinate clause in the factive mood (section 6.5.4.2) in the past tense, and
by a subordinate clause in the subjunctive mood in the future tense.
[1] Conditional. Here the subordinate clause indicates the condition under
which the situation described by the other clause occurred, might have occurred,
will occur, etc .. The clause expressing the condition, the antecedent, has. a VP in
the subjunctive mood. It generally precedes the consequent clause, and is usually
characterised by a fall-rise intonation contour, which occurs on the final salient
syllable of the tone group. For example,--- ......","[411, 412, 413, 414, 415]"
"Gooniyandi direct quotation thus corresponds to both direct and indirect quotation
in English. Each of the examples (5-336) to (5-342) above has an alternative
translation as indirect speech in English. For example, (5-346) could be rendered
into English as 'that man demanded that I give him money'.
Speech may also be reported INDIRECfLY, although this is far less frequent
than direct report, at least where the projecting clause is one of speech. The
second clause of (5-347) and the frrst clause of (5-348), for example, representindirectly- the content of the communicative event. This is so whether or notCLAUSE COMPLEXES417the two clauses together constitute a single clause complex (or sentence).Sngoonyi -yidda wardgiri

migama

'Tell me what you'll do.'
Clauses of indirect speech represent the sense of the utterance from the
perspective of the present speech situation. That is, the ongoing speech
situation, and not the one referred to, is the reference point for the deictic
categories of person, tense, and spatial deixis. And it is from this viewpoint that
the 'validity' of the utterance is measured. The distinction between direct and
indirect speech in Gooniyandi, then, does not coincide with the direct/indirect
speech opposition in English. In English the two types contrast in that direct
speech represents the wording of the utterance, and indirect speech represents the
sense (Halliday 1985:230). In Gooniyandi, on the other hand, direct speech
represents the sense of the utterance from the viewpoint of the speech act referred
to, and, as mentioned above, makes no claims about its wording. Gooniyandi
indirect speech represents the sense of the utterance from the viewpoint of the
present speech situation.
Projected indirect quote clauses as a rule follow the projecting clause. There
are only a couple of instances of the reverse order, and in these cases the
projecting clause seems to be added as a type of afterthought. For example, the
final clause inwanyanbiddini I migami -ngiddangi I
(5-349) ngirndaji -ya
he:told to:us
this
LOC they:left:him
'They left him here, he told us.'
was added after a pause, and on a different intonation contour, apparently as a
qualification of the status of the first clause as based on report rather than on
direct observation. (Note in addition that the reference point for spatial deixis has
been shifted in the first clause of (5-349) to the speech situation referred to. It is
8 In this connection it may be relevant to enquire whether (felicitous) responses
to utterances such as (5-347) and (5-348) respond to the clause of communication
or to the clause representing the utterance communicated, or to either. If the first
(only), this would suggest that the clauses do in fact form a complex together.
Unfortunately, I have no data bearing on this question.","[400, 401]"
"SPEECH STYLES19Nominal roots generally have the same meaning as their everyday
counterparts. For example, the avoidance nominal ngarloomaii 'spear'
corresponds to the ordinary generic term for spear,jinali, including in its range
precisely the same subtypes. On those occasions when I requested an avoidance
equivalent for a more specific type of spear, I was invariably given the ordinary
term. The response was invariably the same when I requested other specific
terms, and I could detect no tendency to extend the range of an avoidance
nominal beyond the range of its corresponding ordinary term. It thus appears that
avoidance nominals have exact, or nearly exact, ordinary equivalents, and can not
be used to effect higher order taxonomic groupings than those which are a1rcady
made in the ordinary language (cf. Dixon 1972:292ff).
A few closed class grammatical items also have distinct avoidance terms.
For example, there is a particle woomoorla 'no, not, nothing, without', which
corresponds to the particle mar/ami 'not, nothing, without' of the everyday style,
and perhaps also to mangaddi 'no, not' (sec page 496 below); there is also a
nominal yawinhingi 'some, other' corresponding to the everyday terms yaanya
'other' and yaabja 'some'. At least in the latter instance, a distinction made in the
everyday vocabulary is neutralised in the avoidance vocabulary.
It will come a<> no surprise that in Gooniyandi avoidance speech, as in the
Bunuba variety (Rumsey 1982a), not every word in an utterance need be- or
even could be - an avoidance word. Often only a single word in an utterance
marks it as avoidance speech, whether or not other ordinary words COULD BE
replaced by avoidance terms. Indeed, a single feature, such as use of a non·
singular free pronoun, pronominal enclitic or prefix wit11 singular reference, may
even suffice.
Strategies of language use differ between avoidance spct>.Ch and everyday
speech. There are differences in: (I) modes of address and reference; (2) frequency
of propositional modification; and (3) degree of precision of expression.
(1) A man was of course not supposed to address his actual WM; nor could
he utter her name, or a close homonym. Reference to her could be oblique (e.g.
by using the term moonga 'dark'}, by use of a marked or triangular kin-tenn (e.g.
manaroo '(your) mother', speaking toW or WB), or by use of the third person
non-singular pronominal bidi 'they'. Other maddiyali, with whom speech was
permitted, were addressed with the second person non-singular pronominal gidi,
instead of the singular form nginyji. S/he would be referred to by means of the
third person plural bidi if the relationship was a close one, but otherwise more
frequently by the singular niyi; and the first person unrestricted yaadi 'we three or
more inclusive' would be used instead of ngidi 'we two, we exclusive' (seeINTRODUCTION20· 3 .6) m

speech, presumably with the intended effect of softening the force of the
utterance (cf. Stubbs 1983:113).
(3) Avoidance speech is characteristically vaguer in expression than is
ordinary speech (Rumsey 1982a:l73, McConvell 1982:97), and this vagueness
is iconic of the relation of avoidance or lack of intimacy which it t~nccxles.
Although an avoidance verb is typically vaguer than an ordinary one, much of
the potential ambiguity is resolved once the context is ta.ken into account. For
example, in
(1-1) malab -migooddgoo
make he:effected:it hole
'He dug a hole.'it is quite clear that the intended sense of malab- 'make, construct' is 'dig'. It
should be noted that potential ambiguities are rarely if ever rcsolvctl by
paraphrase in actual texts (cf. Dixon 1972:293). And I suspect that this is partly
because in real terms the ambiguity of a contextualised utterance is usually
relatively small, and far less than the potential ambiguity, and partly because
vagueness is an inherent semantic characteristic, and not just a formal fc.altlrc of
the avoidance style.","[31, 32, 33]"
"In addition to these verbs referring to mental processes, verbs referring to
perceptual processes, especially of sight (mila- 'see'), can also project thoughts.
In this case, the projected clause represents a thought that was perceived, or422THE ClAUSEwhich was based on perceptual evidence; it does not refer to an actual real world
situation that was perceived. This construction frequently translates into English
as a that-clause complement of the verb see. Examples of mila- 'see' projecting

As is the case for the verbs of thought, it may be difficult if not
impossible to distinguish a directly from an indirectly quoted thought. In fact, I
have been unable to find any examples which admit the latter interpretation
only. Furthermore, examples admitting both of these interpretations normally
also allow the interpretation that the 'perceived' clause directly refers to a realworld situation. For example,(5-362) ngabbinamilaloonait:burnt:them I:saw:them
meant 'I saw that (the fire) had burnt them (up)', or 'I saw ""the fire burnt them
(up)""' in the text in which it occurred (since the perceiver was not present at the
time at which the bodies were burnt). It could also mean 'I saw the fire burning
them'. That there is a covert distinction between projected and non-projected
perceptual 'complements' follows from the fact that for the former only do there
(sometimes) exist formally distinct variants like (5-360) and (5-361).","[405, 406]"

Yaabja 'some' is unspecified for number, but as the examples above
indicate, when reference is being made to human beings, the cross-referencingLOGICALMODIFJERS453pronominal in the VP is typically plural (cf. example (6-85) below), whereas it
is usually singular in reference to inanimates. Of course, number may be
specified by means of a co-occurring numeral, as in e.g. yaabja yoowarni
yoowoolaanyi (some one man-other) 'some other man'- that is, an indefinite
single individual of another type of person (e.g. from a different country).
Gooniyandi has no term (either word or enclitic) explicitly indicating
universal quantification, 'all'. The number word garndiwangooddoo 'many' may
be used in this sense, though it remains ambiguous with 'many' and 'most' (cf.
section 6.3.2 below). The same holds true for yaabja, which can be used
partitively in reference to an arbitrary subset of some superset, as discussed
above. Alternatively it may refer to the complement of a subset, if eid1er: (i) the
membership of that subset is uncertain (and/or immaterial), as is the case in

relation between the two subsets, and their relation to the superset (by means of
the definite determiner the), but leaves the undefined status of the set(s)
unmarked. By contrast, Gooniyandi indicates the undefined status of the sets, and
leaves the set-ilieoretic relations unmarked. See also below pages 455-456.
Or (ii) the membership of the subset is determined, but the complement

"TilE WORD134It is necessary to distinguish the g-word from the lexical word, the third
type of word, for which I will sometimes also use the term ""lexeme"". Lexemesare those items which are listed in the dictionary. I include here both morphemes
of all types and certain larger, word-like units which are constructions of
morphemes; but I will exclude idiomatic collocations. The larger unit may be
either an inflectional form of one of the constituent morphemes, the root, or it
may constitute a distinct lexical item, a stem. On the whole, Gooniyandi shows
little inflection. Most of the inflection which does occur is found in the verbal
classifier complex, discussed in section 3.9.3.2 below. A small amount of
inflection is found elsewhere, in pronominals and some spatial adverbials. The
various forms of these words are not readily analysable into constituent
morphemes. For example, nginyji 'you (sg)' and ngaanggi 'yours (sg)' are two
forms of the lexeme ""second person singular"", but neither is amenable to
morphemic analysis (see section 3.6).
Fourthly, there are distributional words, abbreviated d-words, which are free
forms having the property that they cannot be divided into units each of which is
free. Any utterance consists of a whole number of d-words; these are the
minimal forms that may be permuted, the permutations preserving
grammaticality. Constituents of d-words are in general not permutable.
Postpositions (see section 3.7) are the only exceptions: they may be attached to
any g-word in a nominal phrase. For example, (3-5) consists of three d-words,
all orders of which are possible:
(3-5) nganyi -ngga manyi muri -faI
ERG food
'I'll bring you food.'go-wila
-nganggi
SUBJ I:will:do:it for:youBut the parts of the words cannot be permuted either within, or amongst
the separate words: -ngga ERG, for example, could not be attached to manyi
'food', nor could it occur anywhere in the verbal d-word.
D-words may be bounded by pauses, but it is only under exceptional
circumstances that pauses occur within d-words. For example, at the end of my
first field trip, having spent a full hour giving me person, number and tense
forms of verbs, my teacher finally began to tire of the task, and pauses occurred
between the verbal stem and the following classifier complex. However, during
these pauses the articulatory organs did not go back to their rest position, but
were held in place until the form was recalled and the d-word could be completed.
When the pause became too long, or the articulators were not held in place,
renewed attempts always started again at the beginning of the d-word. In thesePARTS-OF-SPEECH135sessions of intensive elicitation of the verbal paradigm I was never given just
the paradigmatically significant piece, the classifier complex; I was always given
the full form with the initial lexical item. In the entire body of texts I recorded
there are no more than a handful of instances in which there is a perceptible
pause within ad-word. Where they occur, these pauses always coincide with
morpheme boundaries, and appear to usually occur when the speaker is suffering
from a momentary lapse in memory or concentration.
Although single d-words could be elicited and discussed in isolation native speakers of Gooniyandi were willing to explain their meaning to me smaller items could not be. Smaller items such as bound morphemes did not
seem to have psychological reality, and were not identified on the few occasions
when, for one reason or another, I cited them in isolation. (They were, however,
immediately identified in retrospect once I provided an example in a d-word.)
The four types of word we have identified do not always coincide in
Gooniyandi. However, some correlations can be made between them. Every gword consists of one or more lexemes, but not every lexeme is a g-word. For
example, mangaddi 'no, not' is a lexeme, but not a g-word (it is not a ranking
item). And distinct g-words may be instantiations of a single lexeme. This is the
case for pronominals, which show two distinct case forms. Every d-word
consists of a whole number of phonological words and a whole number of
lexemes; moreover it consists of either a whole number of, or zero g-words. A
phonological word normally consists of a whole number of lexical words, and a
whole number of, or zero g-words. Exceptions arise within the verbal d-word,
where the two obligatory lexical g-words (the verbal stem and the classifier
complex) which typically constitute separate phonological words, may become
fused together in such a way that the boundary of the phonological word shifts
forward (see section 2.5.3 above). In most of the remainder of this chapter, I will
be referring to phonological words only in passing. The other three types arise
more frequently, and are more easily confused; I will therefore normally use the
more explicit labels to make the reference clear.
3.2 Parts-of-speechIn this section I suggest a classification of the parts-of-speech in Gooniyandi,
embracing all words and morphemes.l The entities I want to classify are the
1 In including both words and morphemes in this classification I am going
against the usual practice of grammarians, who normally include only words, and
not morphemes, in their parts-of-speech classification. There seems to be no1HEWORD136lexical items themselves (see above). abstracted from all context; I do not aim to
classify the g-words and morphemes, the units of the rank scale. A classification
of the lexemes will provide more information than would a classification of the
contextualised units, and it is mainly for this reason that I undertake the former
enterprise.
The major difficulty in assigning Gooniyandi lexical words and morphemes
to classes is their multifunctionality: most occur in a number of distinct
syntagmatic environments. A form such as yoowooloo 'man', for example,
occurs in at least the following five contexts:
(3-6) NP[ngirndaji yoowooloo ]NPthis
'this man'man(3-7) pp[ngidi-yooddDo
we(R) DUyoowooloo]ppman'we two men'
(3-8} yp[yoowooloo -windz]ypman
he:becarne
'He became a man.'
(3-9) K[yoowooloo lK
man
'Man!'
(3-10) N[yoowooloo -mili]Nman
'man-crazy'CHARBut there are, however, a number of reasons which suggest that yoowooloo
'man' is a single lexeme uniquely assignable to the class nominal. Firstly, the
commonalty of meaning through the examples suggests that there is a single
morpheme yoowooloo 'man' throughout (3-6) to (3-10); what differences there
are are fairly obviously attributable to the different grammatical environments.
Secondly, a sizeable class of words, all of which are notionally nouns, appear to
convincing reason for this restriction, and since I will be later making use of
various more general labels for morphemes (labels such as nominal suffix), I have
felt that a complete classification would be advantageous at this point to the
reader, and that this small departure from tradition would thus be justified. It is
also for this reason that I have eschewed the term 'word class', and used the more
traditional label 'part-of-speech'.","[118, 119, 120, 121]"
"INTERPERSONAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE389one of the latter lexemes occurs finally in an utterance, it is added as an
afterthought, and occurs on a separate intonation contour of its own. (It perhaps
constitutes a minor clause of the 'modifying' type - see below section 5.4.2.)
For example,(5-256) mooyoo bagi -ma -yi
I yiganyi I
sleep
lie
IND he:was uncertain
'He could have slept there.'
It is suggested that Propositional Modifiers are as a rule thematic - the
exceptions being the few occasions in which the Propositional Modifier occurs
clause finally. Since they express the speaker's angle on the proposition, they
are natural points of departure for the utterance (cf. Halliday 1985:49-50). That
is, for example, mangaddi 'no, not' is thematic in (5-254) and the second clause
of (5-255) even though it is not clause initial. As suggested above (section
5.3.2), in clauses having a thematic interpersonal role, one or more of the
experiential roles will also be thematic. Moreover, the order of the two Themes
was claimed to be semantically significant. It is suggested that greater
prominence is accorded to the frrst Theme in a sequence. This appears to be the
case in(5-257) mangaddi yangbala
-ngga goornboo doownga I
not
young:man ERG woman
he:got:him
'Young men didn't take wives.'
It is clear that, in the text in which (5-257) occurred, which concerned the
differences between marriage practises of pre-contact days and today, the main
Theme is the negation, not the Agents and Goals. Compare on the other hand
correlative constructions such as(5-258) ngooddoo milawa
nganyi mangaddi milaanawoo
that
you:will:see:him I
not
you:see:me
'Look at him, not at me.'
Here it would seem that the speaker is the most prominent Theme, and Focus of
contrast, in the second clause.
I have already discussed (page 368) the circumstances in which the
Propositional Modifier is immediately followed by a focal constituent. If this
constituent is a marked Focus, the material following it embodies a
presupposition that some situation occurred, which usually differs in a single
respect - in terms of the participants, inner roles, attributes or circumstances
involved, or in terms of the process- from the situation claimed not to occur.","[372, 373]"
"2.4.1.1 Stem internal sandhi
In the formation of nominal stems the following three consonant alternations
occur: /b- w/, !j - y/ and /th-y/. These alternations are taken to be instances
of underlying /b, j and th/, on the basis of evidence provided by reduplicated
forms:PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY96
boolgawoolga
joolgooyoolgoo
thigiyigi'old men'
<
'round things' <
'little pieces' <boolga
joolgoo
thigi'old man'
'round'
'short'(It should be noted that not all initial [+lamina!] and [labial] stops undergo these
lenitions, and it may be necessary to mark those that do with a diacritic (see
page 100 below).) There is one stem forming suffix showing the !b - wl
alternation, but none showing the other alternations, and consequently the one
showing the alternation may be seen as having initial fbi underlyingly:
ngaddanybadi 'your mother', ngaboowadi 'your father'.
The rules may be written as follows:
Rl b~w I$ Y V- _ _ V Z $R2 j~yI$ Y V - _ _ V Z $R3 th ~ yI $ Y V - __ V Z $where$ indicates a nominal stem boundary, Y and Z indicate remaining material
irrelevant to the operation of the rule, and the dash indicates the morpheme
boundary. Clearly these rules can be collapsed to something like
R4 [][~~~~~~a::: ~ ~~~~~a::
+labial }
{ +lamina!{ +labial }
+!aminal111]I $ Y V - __ V Z $1. su ff'tctent
.
. I yI . M ore
I t w1'II be assume d t hat [+continuant]
+lamina!
1s
to c haractense
generally, it will be assumed that if a feature is not specified in a rule, and is not
implied by other feature values chosen, the unmarked value is chosen. In this
case, [±liquid] is not specified on the right, although it is a subcategory of
[+continuant]; since the unmarked value is assumed, the features specify lyl, not/lyl.
2.4.1.2 Stem external sandhi
2.4.1.2.1 Consonant assimilation
Distinct processes of stem external sandhi must be recognised because fbi and ljl
fail to lenite outside of stem boundaries, while still within the boundaries of
distributional words (see section 3.1.2):97SANDID
{nganyi
I~-jangi}
SEM{balyoowa
behind-binyi}
PER/nganyijangi/
~'like me'/balyoowabinyi/'from behind'External boundaries exist between postpositions and enclitics (see 3.7 and
3.8), and the words to which they are attached. The main alternation is /j - y/,
which occurs in seven of the twelve postpositions. Since (as mentioned above)
/j/ does not lenite in this position, this can be accounted for as a hardening of
{y} in specifiable environments. A rule can be written as follows:
RS y~jI # X- __ Y #
[ cons~nantal]
-contmuantwhere # indicates the boundary of a distributional word which is not at the same
time a stem. For example,
{warlibiddi-ya}~/warlibiddiya/ (river-LOC) 'at the river'{babligaj-ya}~/babligajja/(pub-LOC)'at the pub'See also examples under 3.7 below.
Another alternation, /g - w/, is attested only for one of the two w-initial
postpositions (and for neither of the two w-initial enclitics). It is suggested that
this is best accounted for as a strengthening of w. My reasons are the following:
(i) the /j - y/ alternation was accounted for by a rule of fortition, and by
analogy, we might also expect a rule of fortition to account for the /g - w/
alternation at the same boundary type; (ii) g is unlikely to lenite in this context
given that it does not lenite in stem formation; and (iii) under the assumption
that there is a rule of fortition at work, no new rule is needed, whereas under the
assumption that the process is one of lenition, an additional rule must be added
to the set of page 96. The postposition undergoing this strengthening is the
allomorph -woo of the dative postposition, which occurs with verbal roots. Rule
VR6 (see below page Ill) accounts for the alternants -woo and -goo.
It seems that we may assume that VR6 applies within the boundaries of all
distributional units, not only verbals. In the environments in which the w-initial
postpositions and enclitics have been encountered they behave as VR6 predicts,
assuming that the disyllabics have initial stress. However, these w-initial forms
have been encountered only following vowels, and it is not known whether the
{w} strengthens to /g/ following non-continuants. (The Jaru cognate of one of
them, -winyja 'for lack of, -wunyja in Jaru, does show the /w - g/ alternationPHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY98-see Tsunoda 1981:226).
Admittedly the evidence for a fortition rule as an explanation of the /g - wf
alternation is rather weaker than the evidence for a fortition rule in the case of the
/j - y/ alternation. As Patrick McConvell has pointed out to me (pers.comm.),
evidence from nearby languages may be relevant, given the multilingual
environment. This suggests that the dative may be underlyingly -goo rather than woo (the former is a pan-Australian dative marker). However, this evidence seems
to me no stronger than my evidence for a fortition rule, and since my assumption
does not require writing a new rule, I adopt the latter assumption.","[80, 81, 82, 83]"
"CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION1.1 Language type
Gooniyandi 1 is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by about one hundred
Aborigines in the south.ern Kimberley region of Western Australia. It was
classified in the lexico-statistical surveys of the 1960s as a member of the
Bunuban (Bunaban, in the earlier spelling) language family, a small family
consisting of just two languages, Bunuba being the other member (O'Grady,
Voegelin and Voegelin 1966:28, 35, Wurm 1972:123). This classification
accords with the earlier classification of Capell (1940:244), who grouped
Gooniyandi and Bunuba together, on typological grounds, as ""prefixing
languages without noun classification"". To date, genetic relationships have not
been definitely established with any other language family in Australia (or
elsewhere), Dixon (1980:3) notwithstanding.
The language shows many characteristics which have come to be regarded
as typical of Australian languages, but is in a number of other respects atypical.
For the initial orientation of the reader, I will mention a selection of these
typical and atypical features. It is not suggested that they represent a significant
typologising of the language.
Gooniyandi has a phonology which accords with the normal Australian
pattern. It shows six distinctive points of articulation for stops and nasals
(bilabial, apico-alveolar, apico-postalveolar, lamina-dental, lamino-palatal and
dorsa-velar), and three for laterals (apico-alveolar, apico-postalveolar, and
lamina-palatal). There is a retroflex frictionless continuant, an apical tap, and
two semivowels. Three short vowels are distinguished; length is contrastive for
1 The language has usually been referred to in the anthropological and linguistic
literature as Gunian; in my earlier writings on the language I used the spelling
Kuniyanti. (For a full list of the variant spellings, see McGregor 1988e.)
However, speakers generally feel the term Gunian to be a shortening (see below
page 72), and prefer that the full form Gooniyandi be used in written reference to
the language and people (Street and Chestnut 1984).","[13, 14]"
"NON-FINITE CLAUSES393The non-finite verb is, as has just been mentioned, the only obligatory
constituent of a non-finite clause, and any bound morpheme which forms a
syntagm with the clause must be attached to it. This bound morpheme may be:
(a) a stem-forming suffix, deriving either nominals- e.g. -mili CHAR
or -gali GD (see section 3.12.1.1) -or adverbials -e.g. -wa MD, or
-waddaMNR (see section 3.12.3.1); or
(b) a postposition, one of -ngga ERG, -nhingi ABLb -yangga ABLz, -ya
LOC, -ngaddi COMIT, or -woo DAT.
Stem-forming suffixes and most postpositions may be added to a verbal stem.
However, -ngga ERG must always follow an infinitive or a stem-forming
suffix; and the locative postposition -ya usually follows the progressive aspect
marker.
The Vnr normally occurs without another constituent that can be identified
as its clausal sister (in the putative non-finite clause); and indeed in the case of
-wa MD and -ya LOC there are no examples at all which show such a sister
constituent. However, I assume throughout that Vnr is dominated by a Kru (nonfinite clause) node, since there are examples of expanded clauses - which
usually consist of just two words - for each of the other non-finite
constructions, and it is not clear that there are any absolute restrictions on
expansion in any case.
Non-finite clauses do not normally occur in isolation. They are usually
found in circumstances which make it clear that they are realising some role in a
finite clause or in an NP. For example,
Entity: Qualifier:
(5-268) [thinga ~ -nhingi] bagiri -ngadda banda -ya
foot
go
ABL
it:lies on:me ground LOC
'My footprint lies on the ground.'
Carrier:
(5-269) NPl [ngiddinyz1NP 1
flyAttribute:
NP2 N Knf[moorlooeyewiddigawoobungngang -jz1Knf -mili]N NP2give IT
CHAR
'The fly is a bung-eye giver.'
Thus, non-finite clauses may be embedded under word nodes, where they are
functionally equivalent to (and interchangeable with) roots, or under phrase (PP)
nodes, where they are functionally equivalent to (and interchangeable with) NPs.","[376, 377]"
