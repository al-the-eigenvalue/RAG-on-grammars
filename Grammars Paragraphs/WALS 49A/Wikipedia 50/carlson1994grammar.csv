"8.3.4. Case marking verbs
Supyire does not extensively use serial verbs as case markers in the way
common in many other West African languages (cf. Givön 1975, Lord 1973,
1989). In fact only three verbs are regularly so used. A few other verbs seem
to be on the verge of developing such a function. One such verb is two
'take', which is extremely common as VI, and which could develop into an
accusative marker with the proper encouragement. I have found no examples
so far, however, in which it did not retain its original basic sense of taking
something in one's hands. The verbs treated below, however, have indisputably developed a case marking function.",[319]
"10.1. Transitivity in Supyire
From a purely structural point of view, it is easy to distinguish transitive
from intransitive sentences in Supyire merely by the presence versus the absence of a direct object. Subjects and direct objects are easily distinguishable by their fixed position in the sentence. 1 It is now generally agreed,
however, that a merely structural account of transitivity is hopelessly inadequate. As a means of making cross-linguistic generalizations, categories
such as subject and direct object run into all sorts of difficulties, since a
structural definition valid for one language is often not applicable to another.
There is a considerable literature on this topic (see in particular Keenan
1976, Hopper and Thompson 1980, Givön 1984, 1989, DeLancey 1987).
Two major points have been established in this literature. The first is that
transitivity from a functional point of view is a scalar phenomenon and not a
binary one. The second is that to gain a clear picture of what the function of
a given syntactic role is, one must take into account both semantic and
pragmatic factors.
Assuming the correctness of this approach, what can be said of the roles of
subject and direct object in Kampwo Supyire? The subject is a largely pragmatic role, just as it is in languages like English and French (see Giv6n
1983, 1984: 139). This means that one cannot simply equate the syntactic
role of subject with a semantic role such as agent. The subject of a clause
can in fact also be the semantic patient, recipient, or even some other role.
The choice of which semantic role is to be subject is a pragmatic one. Having said this, it is necessary to affirm that the hierarchy of ""accessibility"" to400Chapter 10: Transitivity and voicesubject (see Keenan 1976, Keenan and Comrie 1977, Givön 1984) which has
been found valid for other languages is also valid for Supyire:
(1) Agent>Recipient >Patient >OtherAccording to this hierarchy, subjects are more likely to be agents than they
are to be any of the other roles. From a pragmatic point of view, of course,
agents tend to be more interesting and relevant, and are therefore better
candidates on the whole for the position of subject.
The choice of direct object, in contrast, is largely semantic: it is almost
always the patient. This sets Supyire apart from languages such as English
which freely allow recipients, and sometimes even roles lower on the hierarchy, such as instrumental or locative, to be ""promoted"" to direct object (the
so-called ""dative shift"" rule). In such languages the direct object can be defined in pragmatic terms as a secondary clause-level topic. Supyire allows
dative shift with only one verb, kan 'give', which may be characterized as
the prototypical three-participant verb, and whose equivalents in other languages are cross-linguistically the most likely to allow recipient direct objects. Most often when the recipient is made the direct object of kan the patient is suppressed altogether. It is, however, possible to include the patient
as an indirect object marked with the postposition na 'on, at': 2
(2) Mli a
ύ
kan bikf3 ηά.
I
PERF him give pen at
Ί have given him a pen.'
Even where they are allowed (i.e. with the verb kan), recipient direct objects
are quite rare. Of 270 occurrences of kan in the corpus, only 8 ( = 3%) have
recipient direct objects. It is significant that all eight are either anaphoric
pronouns or proper names, an indication that only a highly topical recipient
can be promoted. However, by far the great majority of highly topical recipients (coded by anaphoric pronouns or proper names) are not made direct
object.
A few verbs take direct objects with the semantic role of locative, instrument, or time. Thus the normally intransitive verb jiaara 'walk' may take
such direct objects as sig6 'the bush', kuni 'the road', or tatoongo 'a long
way' to indicate where or how far the walking occurs. An example of an instrumental direct object is the use of Iwoho 'water' as the object of wuli
'bathe' to mean 'take a bath' (lit. 'bathe water'). The verb pyi 'do' may
have the sense 'spend' when it has a direct object referring to a span of time.
Very few verbs have been found so far which permit this kind of non-patient
direct object.
It is clear therefore that the direct object role is not primarily a pragmatic
one. Its major function is to code the semantic role of patient. It should be10.2. Detraasitivization401pointed out though that it does not have a corner on patients. As already
noted above, patients can be coded as subject, and as will be shown below,
patients may be ""demoted"" to indirect object.
The ensuing discussion will demonstrate that the factors affecting
""structural"" transitivity (i.e. whether or not a direct object is present) are of
two sorts. One is pragmatic, involving the relative topicality of participants
in the clause. The other is semantic, involving such things as semantic case
roles (agent, patient, recipient, etc.) and the degree of affectedness of the
patient.","[422, 423, 424]"
"6.1. Determiners1956.1.2.1. Indefinite/partitive and indefinite 'other'
Like all the other determiners, the indefinite determiners (for the forms, see
chapter 5, section 5.1.2.4) normally require a definite head noun. The noun
phrase as a whole, however, is indefinite.
(12) a. pücwd-rjiwägirl-DEF(GlS) IND(GIS)
'a (certain) girl'
b. cyde-biipi)women-DEF(G 1P)IND(G 1P)
'some women'
c. ku-nilaroad-DEF(G3S) IND(G3S)
'a (certain) road'
d. kya-ä-retächew-G4-DEF(G4) IND(G4)
'some meat'
It could well be asked why such a complex form is needed when the noun
in its indefinite form (i.e. with the basic gender suffix only) would do as
well. The answer lies in the domain of referentiality. Simple indefinite nouns
can be either referential or non-referential. In the former case, they are often
of low discourse topicality. The more complex construction with an indefinite determiner, when used in a non-partitive sense in an affirmative clause,
is referential, and moreover, participants introduced in this way tend to be
highly topical. One can therefore say that the simple noun is often non-referential from a pragmatic point of view, and that one major function of the indefinite determiner is to code referential indefinites of importance in the discourse. The indefinite determiner or pronoun basically instructs the hearer
not to search the environment or the preceding discourse for a referent, but
rather to store the information for future reference.
The indefinite determiner may also be used with partitive meaning. In this
case the determiner does not need to agree in number with the head, but only
in gender. That is, a singular determiner may follow a plural head, as in the
following examples:
(13) a .picien-bifwätheir younger.siblings-DEF(GIP)IND(GIS)
'one of their younger siblings'
b. wüu wä
we
IND(GIS)
'one of us'196Chapter 6: Noun phrasesAs the latter example shows, the head of an indefinite determiner may be a
pronoun. Some examples with third person pronoun heads are:
(14) a. Kä u ύ
1j-kär6
and he NARR IP-go
'Then he went
mäsäkwü
kbb-g6
k&
e,

do$kää Ii
lä
/Jye ηϊβοεηηε me.
but
it(G3S) IND(G3S) be good.G3S NEG
but not one (of them) is good/
The last example above illustrates a further point that should be made. In
most cases in affirmative, realis clauses, the noun phrase containing an indefinite determiner is referential, but this is not the case in negative and irrealis clauses, where such a noun phrase usually must be understood to be
non-referential.
As stated above, the head noun ordinarily takes the definite suffix even
with the indefinite determiner. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule
however, in which the head noun is indefinite. One is the common time
phrase cant) kä 'one day 1 , much used in narratives. The more regular cängke
kä is possible, but rarely heard. Another exception is found in the subject of
an exclamatory clause with a deictic identifier pronoun as predicate. In some
cases this seems to have a slightly pejorative force, as in the following example:
(15) Pyä wä
wdf
child IND(GIS) it.is(GlS)
'What a (troublesome) child! (lit. Here's a child!)'
It should be noted that the ambiguity occasioned by the dual function pronoun/determiner together with the similar word order of genitive and prehead determiner is naturally absent for post-head determiners. When these
occur before a noun, they must be interpreted as (genitive) pronouns. The
head (possessed) noun in this case must be in the indefinite form:6.1. Determiners19 7(16) a. wä
pyä
IND(GIS) child
'someone's child*
b. wä
jwü-mü
IND(GIS) say-G5
'someone's words'
Of course a head noun plus indefinite determiner may be a genitive noun
phrase, in which case the determiner is sandwiched between the nouns. The
possessed noun must still be indefinite:
(17) a. nä-gi
wä
man-DEF(GlS)
'a (certain) man's wife'cwd
IND(GIS)wifeb. ced-i7/
wä
ba-ga
woman-DEF(G 1S) IND(G 1S) house-G2S
'a (certain) woman's house'
The indefinite 'other' determiners (see chapter 5, section 5.1.2.5 for the
forms) differ from the indefinite determiners/pronouns in having antecedents
of sorts, perhaps better described as ""alterantecedents"". That is, the indefinite 'other* means ""another of the category mentioned before"". For example,
when one woman has already been mentioned, another may be introduced
with the phrase:
(18) ced-qi
wä-bire
woman-DEF(G 1 S)IND(G 1 S)-OTHER
'another woman'
Examples from other genders are:
(19) a. mobili-ge
kä-biri
car-DEF(G2S) IND(G2S)-OTHER
'another truck'
b. yacS-ni
lä-beri
belly-DEF(G3S) IND(G3S)-OTHER
'another pregnancy'
c. käri-gif
cO-bäri
affairs-DEF(G3P) IND(G3P)-OTHER
'other affairs'
Like the simple indefinites, the indefinite 'other' forms can be used as pronouns. In the following example, the ""alterantecedent"" is in the same sentence:198Chapter 6: Noun phrases(20) Mpiasiyiri kurucyä-gechare HAB.SEQ rise that(EMPH.G2S)place-DEF(G2S) at

"7.1. Basic word order in simple clauses237Chapter 7
Simple clauses
In this chapter the structure of simple (non-complex) clauses will be described. Simple clauses fall into three basic categories based on the type of
predicate they have: those with pronominal predicates (identifier pronouns),
those with copular predicates, and those with verbal predicates. Aside from
this basic categorization, verbal clauses can further be subclassified according to the semantic and pragmatic nominal roles (""cases"") that they have.
After an initial section dealing with the order of constituents in a simple
clause, each of the above categories will be described in turn. The final
category (verbal clauses) comprises by far the greatest variety of subtypes,
and will consequently occupy the bulk of this chapter. The chapter concludes with a section on optional nominal case roles and another on adverbs.","[259, 260]"
"Table 22. Quantifiers
TypeQuantifierGlossUniversalpunf'all'witjyd'all'känä /käni'only' (DEF/INDEF)ye'only'mu'also'bä'even'jüül)'many, much'Exclusive
InclusiveUnlike the independent adjectives, but like the cardinal numerals, the
quantifiers do not agree in noun class with the noun they modify. Two of
them {punf and känä) are nominalizations, and one of these has both definite
and indefinite forms (känä / käni).21
The quantifiers, again like the cardinal numerals, behave tonally like possessed nouns. If they originated as heads of genitive constructions, then their
lack of agreement with the head noun would follow naturally. At present
none of the quantifiers can be used alone as head of a noun phrase, however,
unlike English a//, for example, in the sentence 'All were present on time.'
JüüJ) 'many' also functions as the interrogative quantifier 'how many?',
'how much?', and in fact it is most frequently met in that capacity. Its noninterrogative function is more often filled by the adjectival form nipyahara
'much, many', from the verb jiyaAa 'be much, many'.
Five of the quantifiers can 'float'. That is, they can be used adverbially,
placed after the verb and separate from any noun phrase. In this use they
may differ quite a bit in meaning from the quantifier use.
A set of four closely related ""emphatic"" modifiers can be included here
because they behave syntactically like the quantifiers. Etymologically, these
modifiers are denominal. Three of them derive from the gender 3 noun bilini
'seed' and its plural pyäagif. The other has an otherwise unknown gender 1172Chapter 5: Other word classesroot -bä-. In three of the forms the nominal prefix ya- 'thing' is added. The
four forms are:
(34) b)J)nf
ya-bUini
ya-pyäagii
ya-bäyi
These four modifiers can be used interchangeably. The alternation between
singular and plural or between genders 1 and 3 has nothing to with the number or gender of the head noun they modify. Syntactically they behave like
the quantifiers, viz. like the possessed head of a genitive construction. Semantically they fill roughly the function of the emphatic use of the reflexive
pronouns in English. They have nothing to do with reflexivity per se, however. Following are two examples of noun phrases with an emphatic modifier, one with a pronoun head, the other with a noun head. The reader is referred to chapter 6, section 6.3.3.4 for more examples.

'the truth itself5.5. Adverbs
Except for the ideophones (see below section 5.5.1.2), Supyire does not have
a large class of adverbs. Unlike the adjectives, there is no productive morphological process for forming adverbs from other word classes. Most of the
work done by manner adverbs in languages like English and French is done
by serial verb constructions in Supyire. There is a rich set of verbs used in
such constructions, so that Supyire is certainly not impoverished in its means
in this regard. See chapter 8 for a description of the ""adverbial"" serial verbs.
In a similar vein, Supyire, like most languages, codes adverbial expressions
of location and time mainly as postpositional phrases. These will not be dealt
with in this section, which is concerned only with the class of one word adverbs. For the interrogative adverbs (di 'how?' and taä 'where?'), see section 5.9 below.
The adverbs may be divided into two groups for expository purposes: adverbs of quantity and manner, and adverbs of location and time.","[194, 195]"
"Identificational clauses have no further constituents (see following section
for a description). As can be seen from the examples above, however, copular and verbal clauses can and usually do consist of more than simply a subject followed by a copula or verb. Except in the case of existential clauses,
copular clauses have something following the copula, either a predicate
nominal, as in the above example, or an adpositional phrase functioning as a
locative or dative, or an adverb:
(2) a. with locative phrase
U pye bag£
e.
she be house .DEF in
'She's in the house.'
b. with dative phrase
Ku pye m)i ά.
it
be me to
'It's mine (lit. it is to me).'
c. with adverb
U pye ani.
she be there
'She's there.'
The basic structure of copular clauses can thus be summarized as follows:
(3)SUBJECTCOPULAPREDICATE NOMINAL
LOCATIVE OR DATIVE PHRASE
ADVERBVerbal clauses have many more possible constituents. Except in very limited cases, verbal clauses require one or more tense-aspect-modality (ΤΑΜ)
auxiliaries, which immediately follow the subject, and are frequently phonologically cliticized to it. Like copular clauses, verbal clauses may also
have adpositional phrases (functioning as indirect objects with various se-7.2. Ideatificatioaal clauses239mantic roles), a predicate nominal, and adverbs, all of which follow the
verb, as they do the copula:
(4) a. with indirect object
Uakärdsig6e.she PERF go
bush.DEF to
'She went to the bush.'
b. with predicate nominal
Uasiceewe.she PERF be.born woman
'She was born a girl.'
c. with adverb
Usim-paηύτηέ.she FUT FP-come now
'She will come now/
In addition, transitive verbs may take a direct object, which is placed between the auxiliary and the verb:
(5) with direct object
Unmha suroshwoho.she HAB mush cook
'She cooks mush.'
The basic structure of verbal clauses is thus:
(6) SUBJECT ΤΑΜ (DO) VERB (PN) (INDIR OBJS) (ADVERB)
The relative order of the postverbal elements is variable, and a single clause
may have more than one indirect object.
It should be pointed out that any nominal and many adverbs in a copular or
verbal clause may be moved to the beginning of the clause for focus purposes. See chapter 12 for a discussion of this construction. Note that this
means that the subject must be defined (in structural terms) not as the first
nominal of the clause, but as the nominal which immediately precedes the
copula or the auxiliary.","[261, 262]"

'Pray to God for me.*The benefactive case role may also be encoded by means of the verb kan
'give' in a serial verb construction. See chapter 8, section 8.3.4.2, for a description of this construction.
7.5.2. Associative and instrumental
As in many languages, the associative ('with') and the instrumental ('with')
cases are coded the same in Supyire, by means of the preposition-postposition pair ui.../'with\ Compare the following examples:
(107) a. associative
Mil pööga

b. instrumental

6.

FUT you cover with cloth-cover with
Ί will cover you with a blanket.'
This is the predominant means of coding the associative, the corresponding
serial construction (with the verb 'take') being comparatively infrequent. It
is a minority means of coding the instrumental, however, the serial construction (with the verb 'use'; see chapter 8, section 8.3.4.1) being roughly
twice as frequent.
7.5.3. Manner
Manner is much more frequently coded with serial verbs than with postpositional phrases. However, a few postpositional manner phrases have been recorded. In the following example, the noun involved is a compound consist-276Chapter 7: Simple clausesing of Ιύ- 'gall bladder, bile"" and tään 'be sweet'. The resulting noun, lütään
means 'calmness', and in a manner phrase, 'slowness' or 'softness':

"Notes: Chapter 671121. Punf also has an indefinite form, but this is used exclusively in the adverbial function alluded to below. It is a nominalization of an adjective
root puN- (see section 5.2 above).
22. See preceding note. Puno is actually mostly used in negative clauses,
where its meaning is '(not) at all'.
23. This has a very restricted use as an adverb, being used only with verbs
repeated to code duration. The ye in such cases adds intensity to the action and length to the duration.
24. This adverb expresses counterexpectation and surprise.
25. Borrowed from Bambara.
26. This word is interesting for having the sole instance of a labiovelar stop
recorded so far in Kampwo Supyire. The sound is common in other
Senufo languages.
27. The suffix -oo on this adverb is perhaps related to the 'attenuation'
marker yod (see section 5.10).
28. This is related to the nominalizing suffix -mbää 'without' (see chapter
3, section 3.2.2.8). Both are borrowed from Bambara: ball 'prevent
from', and
-bali'without'.
29. There is no simple English equivalent of the French preposition chez 'at
the house o f .
30. This is the lexicalization pattern labeled 'Romance' by Talmy (1985).
31. This looks like a caique on the Bambara preposition-postposition combination ni...ye. Ni\s also a conjunction in Bambara used to conjoin noun
phrases. Ye is a postposition with other uses as well, notably dative/benefactive and locative goal. The combination ni...ye, like the
Supyire equivalent, codes comitative and instrument.
32. The definite suffix is often added to the noun: njpirjf na.
33. The definite suffix is sometimes added to the noun: ß\vog6na.
34. Some speakers leave off the simple postposition. For these speakers,
käntugo is a new simple postposition.
35. Färäfin is borrowed from Bambara, and means literally 'black skin'.","[733, 734]"
"731guages (with an auxiliary between the subject and direct object), gapping is an ideal strategy for direct object, but not at all for subject.
Ordinarily a direct object consisting of a simple anaphoric pronoun
should take the (floating) low tone of the perfect auxiliary. The reasons
why it does not do so in this example (and a handful of others) are unclear, but probably have something to do with the exclamatory nature of
the utterance.
The basic meaning of wyere (definite wyeire) is 'leaves'. Herbalist
practices have led to the extension of the word to cover both 'medicine'
and 'poison', as here.
Lakyärä is borrowed from Bambara lakari 'antidote'.
Säsä is an intensifier that occurs only with ηά/ηέ 'now'. The combination means 'right now', 'this instant'. Its use by the speaker of the example is an exaggeration, since the person referred to had died several
months previously.
The high tone on the subject pronoun is also found in the realis (high
tone) complement clause type (see chapter 11, section 11.3). The highlow tune on the identifier pronoun is surprising, since normally these
pronouns, which have a strong mid basic tune, simply allow a preceding
high to spread onto them, wiping out the mid tone. The source of the final low remains unexplained at present.
The genitive particle in a few cases is not used for focus as in the above
examples, but to show that a genitive construction is intended in certain
cases where there could be another interpretation. Thus, since sometimes adjectives can be used substantially, occasionally the combination noun + adjective could actually be intended to be genitive + noun.
The following phrase could thus have the two meanings indicated:
Dähä nin-jwogi
Daha ADJ-take.DEF(GlS)
a. 'Daha taken' (e.g. in Ί saw Daha taken from the room.')
b. 'Daha's taking' i.e. his salary
The use of the genitive particle unambiguously forces the second interpretation, but does not necessarily indicate any focus on the genitive
noun:
Dähä ' ύ
nin-jwoiji
Daha GEN ADJ-take.DEF(GlS)
'Daha's salary'
A difficulty of another sort arises in participial nominalizations in which
the deverbal adjective is accompanied by an adpositional phrase. Since
the adpositional phrase intervenes between the genitive and its head, the732Notes: Chapter 13
only way to show that a genitive construction is intended is to insert the
genitive particle in front of the head noun:
pddrji
nu-vworogi
lwoh6
e
catfish.DEF ADJ-come.out.DEF water.DEF from
υ
tunmp6
GEN noise.DEF
'the noise of the catfish coming out of the water'Here again there is no hint of any kind of special focus. A possible explanation of the distribution of functions of the genitive particle may be
that it was formerly used in all genitive constructions, but was subsequently lost in ordinary genitives. It was retained in those cases where it
was necessary to indicate that a genitive construction was intended, and
also in those cases where there was a special focus (accompanied by intonational stress) on the possessor noun phrase.
9. This does not hold for left dislocated time phrases. See below for examples of these.
10. The cicahagikii are dried gourds with the seeds still inside them. They
are played by a chorus of women who sing to their own accompaniment. The primary meaning of the word translated 'play' is 'hit', which
is entirely appropriate for a percussion instrument.
11. Part of the funeral celebration is a Mast dance' for the deceased, in
which the body is danced through the village by six young men.","[754, 755]"
"2.1.1.3. Glottalization
The conversion of /g/ to [?] has already been mentioned. Several
grammatical morphemes exhibit an alternation between /g/ (or [R]) and [?].
In some cases the glottal form is at least partially predictable, as in the
gender 3 plural noun suffix -gilisee chapter 3, section 3.1.1.13). In others it
is lexicalized with certain roots, as in the case of the gender 2 singular suffix
-gV{see chapter 3, section 3.1.1.7).
The alternation of the conditional auxiliary kä with the voiced variant gä
was discussed above. This auxiliary also has a variant -hä ([?a]) which is
obligatory following simple non-demonstrative pronouns. In the case of the
first and second person and third person gender 1, the vowel of the pronoun
is diphthongized (for details see section 2.2.1.1 below). The other class pronouns (genders 2-5) all replace their vowels with [a]. The pronoun and conditional auxiliary together form a 'CVCV foot. Some examples of this combination are:2.1. Consonants 13

Voiceless stops are ""protected"" from voicing when they are preceded by a
nasal. In this same environment voiced stops are weakened. If the nasalplus-stop occurs in a stressed syllable, the stop is greatly attenuated, for most
speakers being reduced to an oral release of the nasal. The future intransitive
is a good place to illustrate this process, since part of the future marking is a
nasal prefix on the verb. The examples in (10a) show this prefix on verbs
beginning with voiceless stops, the examples in (10b) before the corresponding voiced stops.

Conditional5.7. Adpositions
Supyire marks oblique cases by means of several postpositions and three
prepositions. These adpositions can be conveniently divided on the basis of
form into simple and complex. The simple adpositions occur alone. The
complex postpositions are composed of a denominal first part followed by
one of the simple postpositions.
5.7.1. Simple adpositions
There are eight simple postpositions. I have argued elsewhere (see Carlson
1989) that most of these derive historically from verbs. They behave tonally
like transitive verbs preceded by a direct object. Some of them are quite old,
going back to proto-Senufo and beyond. Others are of more recent origin,
and are shared by only a few other Senufo languages. Some of the older
postpositions show the ravages of time in phonological erosion. These have
lost their initial consonants, and are reduced to being mere vowel clitics on
the noun phrases they mark. The dative marker ά 'to, for, from' comes from
ηιάΛ a form still encountered in poetry. The locative / comes from *ni, which

In this section we will examine those case roles that are peripheral or
'optional', in the sense that they are not a necessary ingredient of the mental
representation of the events in which they participate. They are instead circumstancial to specific events. Like nuclear or ""obligatory"" roles, the peripheral cases are coded in two basic ways in Supyire: as indirect objects
marked with adpositions, or as direct objects of serial verbs. The latter coding method will be dealt with in chapter 8. This section will be concerned
only with the various types of indirect objects which can appear in a simple,
one-verb clause.",[297]
"5.1. Pronouns and determiners
Supyire pronouns may be divided into two quite distinct groups on the basis
of morphological form: first and second person pronouns, and third person
pronouns. Third person pronouns are intimately tied to the noun gender system. There are separate pronouns for each gender, singular and plural. The
anaphoric pronouns are phonologically clitics, and undergo many tonal rules
which to not apply to nouns. First and second person declarative pronouns,
on the other hand, behave tonally like nouns, and from the point of view of
the gender system, they resemble gender 1 nouns. None of the Supyire pronouns is sensitive to case (with the exception that the first person singular
non-declarative pronoun cannot be subject). The same form is used for subject, direct object, indirect object, and possessor.",[174]

Like all determiners, the definite 'other' determiners take a definite head
noun. Because their noun gender marking is that used on nouns, they themselves may take either definite or indefinite suffixes. In all the above examples, the definite form is used, and this is by far the most common usage. In200Chapter 6: Norn phrasesfact, although speakers will readily supply the indefinite forms if asked for
them, only two naturally occurring cases have been recorded, compared to
more than fifty of the definite forms. It is curious that both these cases are in
gender 4, but no explanation for this has been found. The meaning appears
to be the same as when the definite form is used.","[222, 223]"
"14.1. Manipulative speech acts517Chapter 14
Non-declarative speech acts
Most if not all languages distinguish three major sentence types: declarative,
imperative, and interrogative (Sadock and Zwicky 1985). Supyire, in common with all the Senufo languages, conforms to this generalization. The bulk
of this grammar is devoted to declaratives, in conformity with descriptive
tradition. This tradition is probably due to the twin factors of the greater
text-frequency of declaratives and to the greater degree of syntactic elaboration usually found in declaratives (Givön 1990, chapter 18). This chapter in
contrast is devoted entirely to the description of the other two sentence
types.
The three major sentence types can be conceived of as grammaticalized
means of performing three major functions of language: to convey information (declarative), to give orders, requests, invitations or the like
(imperative), and to elicit information (interrogative). In Supyire, as in many
languages, imperatives are principally distinguished by what they lack
(subject, auxiliary) in comparison to other clause types. There is also one
auxiliary used exclusively in a subtype of imperative. Also dealt with in this
chapter is the use of the subjunctive to accomplish a politer manipulation
than the ""bare"" imperative.
Questions in Kampwo Supyire are a more marked sentence type than either
imperatives or declaratives. All questions have some sort of interrogative
particle at the end or, in a few cases, at the beginning of the sentence. In addition, in constituent (""wh"") questions, the use of question words and, in the
majority of questions, the use of the cleft focus construction also mark the
clause as different.
A further characteristic distinguishing both imperatives and interrogatives
from declaratives is the use of the non-declarative set of first and second
person pronouns (for the form of these pronouns see chapter 5, section
5.1.1.2). These special pronouns are not obligatory in imperatives and questions, and in fact, ordinary first and second person pronouns are even more
common in these sentence types. Further, the first person singular non-declarative pronoun na cannot be used as subject. On the other hand, the nondeclarative pronouns cannot be used in declarative sentences, except in three
functions: as reflexive genitive possessors (see chapter 6, section 6.2.1), as
genitive possessors in vocatives (first person only), and in exclamations. Examples of the latter two functions are:518Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts(1) a. vocative, genitive possessor

b. exclamation, genitive possessor

'But your fruit is delicious!1
c. exclamation, indirect object
Νύ fblä
ä
cü
nä
näf
cow owner PERF grab me.NONDECLon
'The owner of the cow has caught me!'
The vocative can perhaps be distinguished as a minor speech act (getting
the addressee's attention, or acknowledging or establishing a specific level
of politeness or familiarity/formality with the addressee) which is different
from the declarative speech act of conveying information. Exclamations,
when they are complete clauses, are usually syntactically like declaratives in
Kampwo Supyire (there are no 'interrogative' type exclamations like English
'How tall you are!' or 'What a mess you've gotten into!'). The use of the
non-declarative pronouns is an indication that they are not prototypical declaratives. Their major function is certainly not to convey propositional-semantic information. It should also be noted here that the non-declaratives are
sometimes used in poetry in what seem to be declarative clauses. This may
be an indication that their use was more widespread in the grammar formerly.
Aside from these relatively minor uses, the presence of a non-declarative
pronoun constitutes a rather clear indication of the non-declarative status of
the clause in which it occurs. There is some anecdotal evidence that the use
of non-declarative pronouns is at least in some cases more polite than the
corresponding use of ordinary pronouns in the same command or question
would be.","[538, 539, 540, 541]"
"1.7. A word on the examples
The majority of examples used are taken from the text collection alluded to
in section 1.5 above. Occasionally elicited examples are used in the interests
of clarity. Glossing presents a few problems. The sex-based gender system
of English pronouns is a constant annoyance. The gender 1 pronouns of
Supyire are used for human beings of both sexes. In elicited examples the
gloss 's/he' is used for the gender 1 singular pronouns to indicate that a
person of either sex could be intended. In examples taken from texts, the
gloss used is simply 'he* or 'she' depending on the sex of the participant
referred to. It should always be born in mind, however, that the gloss adds
information which is not actually present in the Supyire.
On the other hand, the glosses employed on occasion leave out
information, in the interests of avoiding irrelevant clutter. Thus in much of
the grammar, pronouns of various genders are glossed as 'it', without6Chapter I: Introductionindicating the particular gender involved. In a similar way, definite noun
suffixes are simply labeled 'DEF', without indicating their gender. Anyone
interested in the precise gender of a pronoun or suffix will find the tables in
chapters 3 and 5 handy.
Another case of underdifferentiation in glossing is the narrative conjunctions kä and mä. These are usually glossed simply 'and', although they usually mean something like 'and then' and also include switch reference information: kä indicates different subject, mä same subject as the preceding
clause.
The differences in word order between English and Supyire have made the
free translations of multi-line examples awkward at times. This problem is
especially acute with relative clauses, which in Supyire are preposed to the
main clause rather than embedded. In chapter 13 accordingly many examples
have a more natural translation appended at the end labeled 'Freely... 1 . This
translation is closer to the functional equivalent in English, though of course
it is further from the Supyire form.","[28, 29]"

Introduction
1.1. The people
The Supyire language is spoken by the Supyire people. The noun süpyfrä, in
effect, has two meanings: 'the people' and 'the language spoken by the people'. The word is used as a name in both senses in this grammar. The
Supyire live in southeastern Mali in the region of Sikasso (see map 1). By
tradition they came from the south, and this is probably historically accurate
since the main body of the Senufo language group, to which Supyire
belongs, is located in northern Cöte d'lvoire (see map 2).
The Supyire are peasant farmers. They cultivate various kinds of cereals
and keep livestock. Traditional political organization did not go beyond the
village level. They have, however, been incorporated into various political
entities in the region. In the last 125 years they have successively been part
of the Jula kingdom of Sikasso, French West Africa, and finally the country
of Mali.
The dialect described in this grammar is spoken in the region of Kampwo,
to the west of Sikasso and bordering the Bambara-speaking region of Gana
(not to be confused with the country of Ghana). The data was collected in
the village of Farakala, located 40 kilometers west of Sikasso on the main
road to the capital Bamako, and from neighboring villages, none more than
15 kilometers from Farakala.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"11.1. Types of Complement Clause
On the basis of form one can distinguish three basic types of complement
clause in Kampwo Supyire. 1 These basic types in turn broadly classify the
verbs which they complement into semantic groupings. The pairing of complement type with verb type is similar to that found in other languages (see
in particular Giv<Sn 1980, 1984: 117, and 1990, chapter 13). These pairings
will be briefly introduced in this section, and then will be dealt with in detail
one by one in the following sections.
One characteristic common to all complement clauses (not counting full
nominalizations) is their position: they are all ""extraposed"". They are placed
after the verb even when they function as the direct object. Sometimes an
""anticipatory"" pronoun is placed in the object position before the verb. This
obligatory ""extraposition"" raises the question of whether the complement
clauses are embedded at all: perhaps they should rather be analyzed as a special case of parataxis. This question is addressed in section 11.7 after the
relevant structures have all been described.
The ""modality"" verbs (expressing obligation, desire, and intention) take
subjunctive complements in which the subject must be coreferential with the
main clause subject:
(1) Mli a
yaa ml) /
ή-ΐίάτέ Sukwoo na.
I
PERFmust I
SUBJUNC IP-go Sikasso at
Ί must go to Sikasso. 1
Manipulative verbs also take subjunctive complements when the main
clause is irrealis. The complement subject is coreferential with the main
clause direct object:422Chapter 11: Complement clauses(2) Ail) si
ύ py)
u ύ
ή-Ιίάτέ Sukwoo na.
I
FUT him make he SUBJUNC IP-go Sikasso at
Ί will make him go to Sikasso.'
The same verbs take a realis complement (marked with a high tone on the
subject pronoun) when the main clause is realis (and when implicativity is
intended). The realis complement may be perfective, in which case it takes
the perfect auxiliary έ, or imperfective, in which case it takes the reduced
form of the progressive auxiliary:
(3) a. perfective complement
Mli a
ύ py)
ύ
ά
kärd
I
PERF him make he.COMP PERF go
Ί made him go to Sikasso.'","[444, 445]"
"13.1. Basic structure and function of relative clauses
Relative clauses in such languages as English and French are commonly divided into ""restrictive"" and ""non-restrictive"". This is unnecessary in Supyire
for the simple reason that all relative clauses are restrictive. Non-restrictive
relative clauses, in those languages which have them, function mainly to
code parenthetical assertions. This function is accomplished by simple
parataxis in Kampwo Supyire. Thus the following example can reasonably
be translated idiomatically in English with a non-restrictive relative clause.
Note, however, that there is nothing in the Supyire which resembles the kind
of relative clause structure described below in this section.
(1)Kälires)and it(EMPH) NARR
'It ( = the bird)

Käcedijis)ή-kärd...and woman.DEF NARR IP-go
Then the woman went...'
Freely: 'It heard all the words of the crocodile and the woman,
whose name was Nteencwo. Then the woman left...'
All relative clauses in Supyire, then, are restrictive. They serve to restrict
the reference or interpretation of the noun they modify (though see below on488Chapter 13: Relative clauses""afterthought"" relatives). In the most typical case, the speaker provides information in the relative clause which allows the addressee to uniquely identify the referent of the modified noun. In order to accomplish this function,
the information provided must be about the referent, and must be known to
or inferable by the addressee. Relative clauses thus contain a noun phrase
which is coreferential with the noun phrase being modified in the main
clause, and the information they contain is most often treated as presupposed
by speakers (cf. Givdn 1990, chapter 15).1 It is not surprising that such
clauses share basic characteristics with cleft focus constructions and the
commonest type of constituent questions, both of which consist of an initial
noun phrase followed by a clause containing presupposed information. Neither of these constructions derive historically from the present day relative
clause construction, however.
Relative clauses in Supyire are unembedded. 2 The most typical variety,
with definite, referential heads, are preposed to the main clause. The relative
clause is terminated by the clause final relative marker k6, frequently voiced
to g6, and is typically followed by a short pause before the main clause. 3

mu a
kürü
c6.
thing.DEF it PERF him kill REL you PERF it(EMPH) know
'The thing that killed him, you know it.'
Freely: 'You know the thing that killed him'
The etymology of k6 is not certain, but it is undoubtedly related to the locative question marker of the identical form k6 (see chapter 14, section
14.2.2.7). A connection between a locative question word or marker and the
relative clause marker is attested in a number of languages (see Givön
1990b, where Krio, modern Greek, southern colloquial German, and Bambara are cited). Both the relative k6 and the interrogative k6 are quite likely
derived from the gender 2 singular demonstrative r)k6. The corresponding
relative marker in Cebaara is
which is probably derived from the gender
3 singular demonstrative tee. In Cebaara the marker is generally placed after
the verb rather than at the end of the relative clause. This placement and the
demonstrative etymology can be taken as indications that the markers had a
nominalizing function originally.
As noted above, in the canonical relative clause construction there are two
coreferential noun phrases, one in the relative clause and one in the main
clause. The first of these we will call the ""relativized noun phrase"". It is in
some respects like the ""head"" noun phrase in a language like English, since
it comes first in the construction and is more fully specified. The noun
phrase in the following main clause, which is typically pronominalized, will
be labeled simply as the ""coreferential noun phrase"". The relativized noun
phrase is most frequently placed at the beginning of the relative clause, and
may or may not be additionally marked with an ordinary demonstrative or13.1. Basic structure and function of relative clauses489with a relative determiner. The coreferential noun phrase typically takes the
form of an emphatic pronoun (e.g. uru, pire, etc.; see section 13.3 below for
a discussion of the use of these pronouns), and occurs in the position it
would normally take in the clause (that is, it is most often not focused). The
following example (as well as the previous one) illustrates all these features.
In it the relativized noun phrase is the subject of the relative clause, and the
coreferential noun phrase is likewise the subject of the main clause:
(3) Pücwdgi
u
jjye ηά
mu f
ke,
girl.DEF(GlS) she(GlS) be with you with REL
'The girl who is with you,
uru
si
ή-kwü.
she(EMPH.GlS) FUT FP-die
she will die.'
Freely: 'The girl who is with you will die.'
The similarity of this construction with the left dislocated topic construction described in chapter 12 (section 12.2.2) should be noted. In a topic construction, the topicalized noun phrase is placed before the main clause, from
which it is typically separated by a pause. The position from which it was removed in the main clause is typically indicated by a pronoun, most often an
emphatic pronoun. It looks as though the relativized noun phrase together
with its modifying clause is being treated syntactically as if it were a topic
noun phrase. Looked at from a functional point of view, this is not very
strange. As noted in chapter 12, left dislocated topics are generally not
highly ""continuous"". That is, they most frequently represent a switch from
the topic of the previous bit of discourse. Participants introduced with relative clauses tend to be even more discontinuous. About 70% of relativized
noun phrases refer to participants not previously referred to in the discourse
in which they are found.
The ""canonical"" structure described in the preceding paragraphs can be
varied in a number of ways. These variations are the subject of the remaining subsections of this chapter. One of them can be disposed of immediately,
however, since it is rather minor. The final relative clause marker k6 is
sometimes replaced with the functionally equivalent marker ä de. This is extremely rare in the corpus (3 examples, out of a total of 288 relative
clauses). It may be dialectal or archaic (all three examples were produced by
two very old men not from Farakala) although I encountered no difficulty in
eliciting examples from young people in Farakala. The etymology of the ä de
marker is unknown, though it is quite possibly related to the relative clause
marker in Cebaara, id. Following is an example of an ä de relative. The relativized noun phrase is the subject of the relative clause, the coreferential
noun phrase is a genitive possessor in a focused time phrase in the main490Chapter 13: Relative clausesclause. The sentence is taken from a quotation, which accounts for the use of
would in the English translation:

he(EMPH.GlS) FUT Samory catch
he would capture Samory.""
Freely: '(On) the twentieth day of the month which was just about to
begin he would catch Samory.'
Another variation which is also not very important in terms of the number
of tokens (N = 3) recorded so far is the delaying of the relative clause till
after the main clause, apparently because it is an afterthought. Following is
an example:
(5) Mu ahä ' bü

RELThe other variations in relative clause structure and function treated below
are: the different ways of coding the relativized noun phrase, including
whether or not it is fronted (section 13.2); the different ways of coding the
coreferential noun phrase in the main clause (section 13.3); the treatment of
non-referential relativized noun phrases (section 13.4) and referential indefinite relativized noun phrases (section 13.5); and negative relative clauses
(section 13.6). A final section (13.7) describes ""semi-embedding"" and discusses the syntactic status of relative clauses.","[510, 511, 512, 513]"
"13.3. The preferential noun phrase in the main clause503The coreferential noun phrase may be modified by a quantifier not present
in the relativized noun phrase, again rendering its meaning more precise.
The following example has an indefinite/partitive determiner (cf. also (11a)
above, with the quantifier 'all'):

When the relativized noun phrase is a first or second person pronoun, the
coreferential noun phrase is the same pronoun, as in (16) above. When the
relativized noun phrase is non-referential, the second person singular pronoun is sometimes used as a coreferent, in a manner reminiscent of the nonreferential use of 'you' in English. (The following example is also of interest
in that it has a topic noun phrase preceding the relative clause.)

in Supyire, as is common in languages with gender systems. Thus while gender 1 can be characterized semantically as the ""human"" gender, there are a
few words in other genders which can be used to refer to human beings. The
gender 2 noun yaaga 'thing', for example, is sometimes used in a rather informal way to refer to a person. In syntactically ""tight"" constructions, such
as within a noun phrase, agreement is governed entirely by grammatical
gender. In ""loose"" constructions, however, such as between clauses, there is
a tendancy to revert to a more semantically appropriate gender. Note in the
following example that the relative determiner agrees with its gender 2 head
noun, but the coreferential noun phrase in the main clause is gender 1, which
is more semantically appropriate:

Relative clauses in which the relativized noun phrase functions to encode
time frequently function as time adverbial clauses for the following main

"12.1.1. The cleft focusconstructionThe "" c l e f t "" construction in Supyire differs from the construction so labeled
in other languages (e.g. English) in that it has none of the specific trappings
of relative clause syntax, and does not appear to be derived from it in any
way. Indeed, as will be shown in chapter 13, the influence seems to have
been in the opposite direction. The label is justified on two grounds, however. Firstly, the function of the Supyire construction approximates that of
clefts in other languages. Secondly, the Supyire construction shares certain
syntactic characteristics with clefts in other languages, characteristics quite
separate from anything specifically related to relative clauses.
The cleft in Supyire, like that in other languages, functions primarily to
code strong focus on one item in the proposition. As noted in the preceding
section, a speaker may choose to put an item of information under strong focus for a variety of reasons. The focused item may or may not be new information, but the ""out of focus"" part of the construction is typically presupposed (in a pragmatic if not strictly logical sense).
From the coding point of view, the Supyire cleft is like other clefts in the
following ways: the focused noun phrase is placed first, followed, without a
pause, by the rest of the clause containing the presupposed information. The
focused item receives heavy stress, and the rest of the clause is correspondingly relatively unstressed. In the affirmative, no copula or other verbal element marks the focused noun phrase: 1
(1) Sig6
e υ
a
kard.
bush.DEF to s/he PERF go
'It is to the bush that s/he has gone.'
In the negative, the negative identifier bä 'it is not' is placed after the focused noun phrase.
(2) Sig6
e bä
u
a
Jcärd mi.
bush.DEF to it.it.not s/he PERF go
NEG
'It isn't to the bush that s/he has gone.'
The three elements of fronting the focused item, heavy intonational stress
on the focused item, and use of a quasi-copula (at least in the negative) are
all elements shared by typical clefts cross-linguistically. The absence of any
relative clause morphology and syntax (specifically the absence of relative12.1. Focus constructions469pronouns and of the clause final relative marker) is typical of strong focus
constructions in West African languages (see Creissels 1978 for a survey of
twenty languages).
The presupposed, ""out of focus"" clause which follows the focused item is
not marked in any special way in Supyire with one exception. If the tenseaspect is present progressive (with the auxiliary na), the copula pye is inserted before the auxiliary:
(3) Na
mu /
m)i pye na
yu.
with you with I
be PROG speak.IMPFV
'It is with you that I ' m speaking.'
This admittedly restricted marking of the presupposed part of the proposition
is also found in questions and relative clauses, and forms part of the marking
of negation in progressive clauses (see chapter 9, section 9.4.1.2).
When word order is exploited for pragmatic purposes, its function of coding syntactic roles is disrupted. The cleft construction thus creates a ""caserecoverability"" problem: how does the speaker let the addressee know what
the syntactic case role of the focused item is? With a focused direct object, a
simple gap is used. If the verb is transitive, the absence of a direct object between the tense-aspect auxiliary and the verb is a clue to the hearer that this
is where the focused item belongs. Note that when the direct object is removed from its normal position, the intransitive prefix appears on the verb.

IP-call bogoWhen the focused item is the subject, it is immediately followed by a
coreferential anaphoric pronoun. Without this pronoun, the focus construction would be morphologically indistinguishable from an ordinary clause,
since the subject normally comes first in such clauses. The strong stress on
the subject would of course provide an intonational clue, but this is evidently
not sufficient. The pronoun, which like ordinary subjects is unstressed, is an
unmistakable indication that the construction is marked for focus. 2 When the
focused item is a first or second person pronoun, the resumptive pronoun is
third person, gender 1. In the following examples, context has been included
where possible to get a feel for the nature of the focus involved.","[491, 492]"
"13.3. The coreferential noun phrase in the main clause
As noted in section 13.1 above, the most common way of marking the coreferential noun phrase in the main clause is by means of an emphatic pronoun.
This goes well with the other functions of the emphatic pronouns in complex
sentences. They are generally used to show coreference in relatively ""loose""
constructions where a high degree of referential ""interference"" is common.
Thus the emphatics are used in a ""logophoric"" function in the loosely bound
indicative complements of verbs of speech and cognition (i.e. they show
coreference with the subject of the main clause; see chapter 11, section
11.5.1). They serve as the coreferential noun phrase in left dislocated topic
constructions, where the topic is typically separated from the main clause
with a pause (see chapter 12, section 12.2.2). In the latter construction, however, other ways of coding the coreferential noun phrase are allowed, and
this is the case with the coreferential noun phrase in the main clause of relative clause constructions. In this section we will briefly examine some of
these alternate codings.
When the relativized noun phrase (and consequently the coreferential noun
phrase) is non-referential and [ +human], the emphatic is sometimes used as
a determiner with the noun foo 'owner, agent, person'. Following is an example ( = example 13):
(21)ljg6-müu siß-jamil lw6DEM-REL he FUT FP-be.able me take
'The one who will be able to throw me,
ml) siηύ/jikanurufdläfi-cyänke,FP-make.fall REL

"See chapter 14, note 5.
Kile is the creator Sky-God. This example is taken from a folktale in
which monkey decides to eat a human being, but determines to do it in a
dense thicket where he is not able to see the sky when he looks up (and
consequently the sky/God cannot see his evil deed).
3. For the use of the conditional in a relative clause, see chapter 13, section 13.4.2.
4. See Thompson and Longacre 1985:204f for a discussion of the phenomenon of extensive borrowing of subordinating morphemes. Such
borrowing seems to be at least as extensive in Supyire as in the two
Mexican languages cited by Thompson and Longacre: Yaqui and Isthmus Zapotec.
5. These are common names of dogs, borrowed from Bambara.
6. See chapter 9, note 12.
7. Compare also the use of 'and' to mark conditionals in early modern
English.
8. Dügüsön 'village festival' is borrowed from Bambara dügü 'village,
town' and son 'worship, offer sacrifices'. The Supyire term is käsunno
(from känhä 'village' + sun 'offer sacrifices', borrowed from the Bambara verb above). The denotatum is an annual festival to thank the tutelary spirits of the village (the 'jinns') for favors during the past year and
to pray for the coming year.
9. Bäärä 'work' is borrowed from Bambara baara 'work'.
10. This seems to be a caique on the Bambara conjunctive phrase ο bee n'a
ta 'this all and its own'.
11. ΚίΙέ'wrench' is borrowed from French c/e/'wrench'.
12. Mekanishyingiri 'mechanics, repair work' is formed from mekanishyen
'mechanic' (borrowed from French m6canicieti) by the addition of a
syllable of unknown origin (plus the gender 4 suffix -rV).
13. Note the similar placement of the conjunction de in ancient Greek,
which has a comparable function.
14. IJkää is underlyingly /hkälä/. The origin of the extra syllable [la], not
found in the standard Bambara form hka, is at present unknown.
15. Y5 is the Supyire equivalent of the ubiquitous ο found in many if not
most West African languages. See Singler (1988).
16. This is evidently an archaic use of the conjunction kä, which in ordinary
language is used as a different subject narrative connective, and cannot
be combined as here with an imperfective verb without any auxiliary.
The current function as a different subject marker accords well with an
etymology pointing to an earlier function as a marker of disjunction.
The archaic nature of the present example is due to its being a proverb.
17. See chapter 13, note 7.",[759]
"3.1. Noun genders
Supyire has a typical Niger-Congo noun class system, with eight noun
classes grouped into five genders. Although there is no verb agreement,
there is full concord within the noun phrase: determiners, independent
adjectives, and at least some quantifiers agree in noun class with the head
noun. Pronouns of course agree in noun class with their antecedents.
The gender system is quite well-behaved. The phenomenon of a particular
morphological form participating in more than one gender, so widespread in
Bantu (e.g. class 10 may be the plural of both class 9 and class 11), is absent
in Senufo. 1 There is therefore little motivation to number the noun classes 18 in imitation of descriptions of Bantu. In this grammar the genders are numbered 1-5. Individual classes will be labeled 'gender 1 singular', 'gender 3
plural', and so forth. 2 Genders 4 and 5 are single class genders.
The morphological elements which mark noun gender may mark some
other category as well, such as definiteness. In a general way, one can say
that the noun class is marked by a consonant, and that other functions are
marked by the following vowel. It is thus possible to speak of ""class
consonants"": each noun class has a typical consonant or family of
consonants (sharing the same point of articulation) which recur again and
again in the morphological marking of that class. Table 3 shows the class
consonant for each class, and in parentheses the related consonants which
may mark the class.
One remark is necessary concerning the gender 3 plural. It will be noticed
that none of the consonants in parentheses are alveopalatal. In fact,
originally the class consonant was /k/, and this is the form which some old
people still prefer. This is being replaced by Id in most of Kampwo,
however.",[98]
"LOC.QThe other strategy of agreement with coordinate noun phrases has been recorded in only two syntactic environments so far: focus of the subject noun
phrase, and modification by an independent adjective. Both may be characterized as being ""tight"" constructions, and the agreement is not anaphoric in
nature. In both cases the agreeing item agrees only with the final conjunct.
Contrastive focus is accomplished in Supyire by moving the focused item
to the front of its clause (for a full description see chapter 12). When a subject, which is already at the head of its clause, is focused, it is immediately
followed by a resumptive pronoun which holds its place and is the sole indication that focus is intended. No pause may intervene between the focused
noun phrase and the place-holding pronoun. The pronoun agrees only with
the last conjunct of a coordinate noun phrase in both number and gender. In
the following example, both conjuncts are gender 1. The place-holding pronoun agrees in number only with the final conjunct. Note that the predicate
nominal agrees in both gender and number:236Chapter 6: Noun phrases(123)Mil ηά Ζά u

"2.2.2. Processes affecting unstressedvowels2.2.2.1. Vowel harmony
Vowel harmony is a pervasive phenomenon in Supyire. Unstressed vowels
within a metrical foot harmonize with the initial stressed vowel if they
belong to the same root or to a harmonizing suffix. Derivational affixes on
verbs and most indefinite noun class suffixes harmonize, while inflectional
affixes on verbs (for the most part) and definite noun suffixes do not
harmonize. The unstressed vowel is normally a copy of the stressed vowel
with the following restrictions: (1) Before pause, the final unstressed vowel
(except in most CVrV verbs) cannot be high. Thus before pause [e] and [o]
follow [i] and [u] respectively. (2) Following a nasal consonant [§]
harmonizes with [e] and [i] (before pause) and [2] harmonizes with [o] and
[u] (before pause). This follows from the fact that all vowels are nasalized
following a nasal consonant and nasalized mid vowels do not exist. (3)
Vowel reduction (see below) often turns the unstressed middle vowel of a
three-syllable foot into [3] or something similar. (4) Before pause a final
unstressed [ε] will often be lowered to [a] and [a] to [a]. Some examples of
harmony in disyllabic feet involving noun class suffixes are:

' embarrassment'As stated above, some suffixes (e.g. all definite noun class suffixes) do not
harmonize. Unstressed initial syllables also do not harmonize. The non-harmonizing initial vowel may be part of the root (in which case it is always /i/,
/u/, or /a/):

A very few exceptions to the process of harmony do occur. The most common is the verb kare 'go', which would be *kara if it were regular. There are
a few verbs with two pronunciations, one harmonizing and the other not,
such as koro / kore 'chase', para / pare 'span'. From the greater number of
this kind of exception to harmonization in Cebaara (see Mills 1984: 156-157)
it is probable that harmonization is increasing in Supyire, and that the nonharmonizing variants of the above verbs are the older forms.
The restriction of homorganicity on VV clusters can be treated as a special
case of harmonization: the second V must harmonize with the first V. This
process can be seen in the assimilation of the narrative auxiliary si when it
follows a pronoun or the conjunction mä. It loses its consonant (which is
first rhotacized and then elided like other intervocalic [r]s), and then the
vowel assimilates totally, e.g. u «/becomes υ ύ, and ma s/becomes maä.","[57, 58, 59]"
"727also common. In the case of subject it is marked (at least in many clause
types) by special conjunctions. In the case of the direct object, the antecedent must be only one or two clauses back, and in practice there is almost no confusion.
In poetry the ""demoted"" patient may simply follow the verb without any
postpositional marking, as if it were a predicate nominal. This may be
an archaic usage, in view of the fact that many other syntactic and morphological phenomena found in poetry are demonstrably archaic.
Bikiis derived from the trade name Bic.
Verbs which often take a complement clause (such as jwo 'say' and
16g6 'hear 1 ) were excluded from these calculations because of the special difficulties they present. Also excluded were the verbs treated in
section 10.2.2 below.
Laughren (1973: 148-154) reports a morphological difference between
passive and active in Tyebari which to the best of my knowledge is not
found in any other Senufo language. According to Laughren, in a passive (which she calls 'stative') the final vowel of the subject is lengthened, and in addition there are tonal differences between the passive
and active. Compare the following (I have changed Laughren's transcription to match that used in this grammar): m§ pwb Ί have swept.'
m§ k) pwo Ί have swept it.* ki: pwo 'It is swept/has been swept.'
Unfortunately Laughren does not provide passive sentences in different
tenses, nor with noun subjects. The most that one can say from the data
she gives is that there appears to be a unique passive construction
marked in the auxiliary position in at least one tense-aspect (the perfect?).
The 12.8 figure is actually misleadingly high. The verb involved is jya
'break'. Of the total of 5 passives, 4 occur in one conversation where
there is a great deal of repetition. If that text is eliminated from the calculations, the percentage of passives for jya is just 4.5%, a figure more
in keeping with the rest of the verbs in the group. This points to a methodological weakness in the calculations: no effort was made to ensure
that the data points were independent of each other. Since repetition and
echoing are well established phenomena, the bits of data counted are
not actually all of equal value as an indication of behavior. The figures
presented should therefore be taken as only a rough guide.
Others are Latvian, Urdu, Kupia, Amharic, Igbo, Tera, Songhai, Fijian
etc. See Siewierska (1984:35). One example of what might be considered an agent phrase occurs in the corpus, in a relative clause:

"262Chapter 7: Simple clauses7.4.4. TransitiveverbsIn this section we will examine those verbs which ordinarily take a direct
object. Before proceeding to a closer look at the various configurations of
semantic roles possible with this large group, a word should be said about
the intransitive use of these verbs. For the great majority, the intransitive has
passive meaning, the subject in this case coding the patient of change. This
passive use is described in section 10.2.1 of chapter 10. Besides the passive,
there are two other constructions which detransitivize transitive verbs. These
are the suppression of the patient of certain verbs verbs and the demotion of
the patient to an indirect object role with a few other verbs. Both of these
are relatively minor constructions in terms of the number of verbs they can
occur with. They are dealt with in sections 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 of chapter 10.","[284, 285]"

3. This example is taken from an account of the aftermath of the French
conquest of Sikasso. Kuluncungo, one of the sons of Babemba (the last
king of Sikasso, killed during the French invasion), was counseled by
some of his brothers to go join the forces of Samory, then fighting
against the French in the south. He declined, recalling that Samory had
beseiged Sikasso for sixteen months several years earlier. He is reported
to have then uttered the example in the text, to the effect that he would
rather go die at the hands of the French in Sikasso than join the old enemy of his family, Samory.
4. Kalify6 is borrowed from French qualifier.
5. That is, as if they are the head noun of a genitive construction. This is a
not uncommon pattern cross-linguistically. Croft (1991: 134) points out
that often over time a noun + numeral combination based on a genitive
construction changes into a construction more like noun + adjective. It
is thus interesting to note that for many speakers of Supyire, the numeral behaves tonally like a possessed (head) noun only when the noun
is follows is indefinite. For these speakers, when the head is definite,
the number (also in definite form) keeps its basic tones. It is not known
how widespread this practice is.
6. Three cases of the use of ηιύ with a number having a definite suffix
have been recorded, all from the same speaker.
7. For this speaker (from the Jamutani quartier of Farakala), the imperfective suffix -//undergoes vowel harmony.
8. This and the following example show the lack of application of expected tone rules referred to in note 5 above. For this speaker, the
definite numbers are unaffected tonally, while the indefinite numbers
behave as if possessed.
9. The elicitation of the following example actually was the occasion of a
sharp dispute. One onlooker objected strongly that no such combination
should be tolerated. The person who produced the example maintained
equally heatedly that it was perfectly acceptable. As noted in the text,
no examples of this sort have turned up in recorded discourse material.
10. This example is from a text on funeral customs. The corpse is wrapped
in cloths taken from among the cloths brought by relatives for the funeral, and the number used in the wrapping is quite definite: three for a
man, four for a woman. There is thus no indeterminacy in the disjunction, as there is in the English translation. Note that the conjunction
wälä 'or' is borrowed from Bambara.
11. Of course the specification of any number indicates that the speaker attaches a high degree of importance to that participant. The use of theNotes: Chapter 7713higher numbers, however, is more obviously related to the numerical
meaning, whereas the singularity of 'one' makes it redundant when the
language already distinguishes singularity morphologically.

"722Notes: Chapter 919. This is called the 'hodiernal' tense by some authors (cf. Dahl 1985: 125;
Comrie 1986: 83).
20. There are several morphemes with this segmental form in Kampwo
Supyire. The ones most likely to be confused with the future are the
subjunctive auxiliary si and the narrative/sequential auxiliary si There
are several ways in which these can be distinguished from the future si.
Only the latter is accompanied by the future prefix. The subjunctive and
the narrative are frequently reduced to rV or V, whereas the future is
never so reduced. The subjunctive and the narrative accept a floating
low tone from the left (i.e. from the subject) whereas the future never
hosts a floating tone. The future si can occur in a negative clause,
whereas the subjunctive si and the narrative never can (there is a separate negative subjunctive auxiliary kä). Finally, these three auxiliaries
all combine with the progressive in distinct ways (see section 9.2.7.2).
21. This form is attested in some dialects of Cebaara and in Tagbana
(Clamens 1952: 1425). The form used in standard Cebaara, ή, is reduced through elision of the vowel rather than the consonant.
22. I have suggested elsewhere (Carlson 1989) that the dative postposition
ά, from *mä also has the same etymology. Clamens (1952) was perhaps
the first to make the connection between the perfect and the dative
postposition in a Senufo language, noting that they seemed to be identical in Tagbana. He however suggests the etymology maha 'touch'. The
imperfectivity of ma, as well as its tone, is certainly a count against it,
since a perfect auxiliary ought to derive from a perfective verb. However, the history of the verb 'come' in Senufo is not at all clear. This is
one of only two examples in Supyire in which the imperfective is derived through consonant mutation (the perfective form is pa) and the
only one that displays the alternation of [p] with [m]. The imperfective
ma may be suppletive rather than derived from the perfective. However,
it should be pointed out that the perfective form in central Senufo is
[pa], and that the proto-Senufo form was most likely *paN. The situation is too complicated to resolve without further comparative data.
23. Cf. Dahl 1985: 125 (also Comrie 1986: 85), who points out that in some
cases a perfect has developed into a recent (or ""earlier today"") past.
24. Note that this makes the Supyire perfect resemble zero marking in the
Creole ΤΑΜ system, at least superficially. Compare Bickerton's (1981)
characterization of the zero marking in Creole ΤΑΜ systems as past for
events and present for states. His explanation for this is that these are
the semantically unmarked time references in each case.
25. Comrie (1986: 78) argues that the pluperfect is ""radically different""
from the perfect, and ""should not be given a uniform treatment"" with it.
While there are differences, (Comrie lists a number ad loc.\ cf. also
Dahl 1985: 144) this statement is rather too strong. In fact the pluperfect usually is related morphologically to the perfect. This repeatedNotes: Chapter 926.","[744, 745, 746]"
"1.2. The language
Supyire belongs to the Senufo group of the Gur family of Niger-Congo. Although no systematic reconstruction has yet been done, preliminary evidence
indicates that the Senufo languages can be divided into northern, central, and
southern branches. Supyire is the southernmost member of the northern
group, which also includes Minyanka (spoken in Mali to the north of Supyire), Nanerge, and Sucite (spoken in Burkina Faso). All of these languages
are quite closely related to each other. Supyire is separated from the central
Senufo languages to the south by a narrow band of Mande-speaking people.
The Kampwo dialect described in this grammar is only one of several. At
this point little is known of the degree to which the dialects diverge from
each other. Within the Kampwo area the speech is fairly homogenous, and I
had no difficulty in communicating with people 30 kilometers to the south or2Chapter 1: Introduction20 kilometers to the north of Farakala. Further afield, however, there are notable differences which call for investigation.
The Senufo languages are like other Gur languages in having a suffixal
noun class system. They are atypical, however, in having a word order like
that of Mande languages, to which they are geographically contiguous. The
chief peculiarity of this word order is the placement of the direct object before the verb, but of all indirect objects after the verb. This order is an areal
phenomenon, being also shared by Songai to the north, and, to some extent,
by the Kru languages to the south.
The Senufo languages resemble the Mande languages in numerous other
ways besides word order. Many of these similarities are noted in this grammar, and many more would doubtless come to light if the matter were
studied systematically. It is fairly clear that there has been a long history of
bilingualism in Bambara (or its diaspora Jula) among the Supyire. Many
lexical items and quite a few grammatical ones have been borrowed from
Bambara, and it is probable that several grammatical constructions are
caiques on the corresponding Bambara constructions. An effort has been
made to indicate Bambara borrowings in the examples. The Bambara forms
given are taken from Bailleul (1981), though it should be borne in mind that
the dialect recorded there is standard Bambara, whereas the source dialects
for Supyire loans are normally Gana and Sikasso Jula.","[24, 25]"
"13.2.1. Fronted relativized noun phrases
Placing the relativized noun phrase at the head of its clause creates the same
case recoverability problem that is encountered in similar constructions such
as clefts and constituent questions: how does the speaker let the hearer know
what syntactic case role the fronted noun phrase has in the following clause?
The problem is solved in precisely the same way in relative clauses as in
clefts (cf. chapter 12, section 12.1.1), and questions (cf. chapter 14, section
14.2.2.1), indicating that all of these constructions share a common focus
strategy. A fronted subject is always followed by a place-holding pronoun
which agrees with it in number and gender, as in the following example (cf.
also 2, 3, and 4 above):

by any additional relative or demonstrative markers. This is the most common pattern. Of a total of 141 fronted relativized noun phrases in the corpus
(this figure includes only those with noun heads—pronouns are excluded),
100 ( = 71%) are not further marked.
Marking a fronted relativized noun phrase with a relative determiner (for
the forms see section 5.1.2.8 of chapter 5) is quite rare. In fact, no simple
examples occur in the corpus (the three examples which do occur all have
variations of another sort—they are either negative or semi-embedded—see
below). However, it is not difficult to elicit such examples as the following.
They should probably be regarded as overmarked, although speakers seem
quite happy to produce them outside of a coherent discourse context. Note
that the relative determiner follows the noun it accompanies:

Rather more common is the practice of marking the focused relativized
noun phrase with a simple demonstrative. Ordinarily the demonstrative precedes the noun it modifies (see section 6.1.1 of chapter 6), but the demonstrative marking a focused relativized noun phrase follows the noun it modifies, just as the relative determiner does. Furthermore, the ordinary demonstrative is most often deictic—pointing outside the discourse to something in
the speech context. The demonstrative used to mark a relativized noun
phrase, however, is not deictic. Some examples of this use of the demonstrative are:

Freely: 'It is the people of our country whom I know that I have

In order to encode deixis with the relativized noun phrase, another construction must be used, consisting of a simple anaphoric pronoun followed
by a demonstrative. This construction can be used as the predicate of a verbless presentative clause (see chapter 6, section 6.1.1 for examples). Recall
that the demonstratives are derived from the deictic identifier pronouns,
which are used exclusively as predicates meaning 'here/there is...' (see
chapter 7, section 7.2). When the relative clause is a full verbal clause, the
pronoun-plus-demonstrative complex is supplemented by another demonstrative. This extra demonstrative may be placed in the normal demonstrative
position before the noun, or it may follow the noun. Compare the following
examples:
(12) a. second demonstrative before head noun

Freely: 'Are these clothes that you are wearing the ones your
father gave you?'","[514, 515, 516, 517, 518]"
"6.5. Descriptive genitive phrases
A genitive phrase consisting of a noun possessor followed by the possessive
pronoun wu- may follow a noun as a modifying phrase. The pronoun agrees
in number and gender with the head noun. Note that this is essentially the
same structure as the ordinal numeral construction described in section 6.3.2
above. In its ordinary use as the pronominal head of a genitive construction
(see section 6.2.3, where numerous examples are given) wu- agrees with an
antecedent in number and gender. It means then '(the) one(s) belonging to
X' where X is the genitive possessor. Of course the construction covers
much more than legal possession of property, and such phrases as nißjyii '
wüyi the one (gender 1 singular, speaking of the head tax) of this year' and
lwoh6 wddr6 'the ones (gender 4, speaking of honeycombs) of (i.e. with)
liquid' are common. If such a phrase is placed in apposition to a noun, with
the wu- pronoun agreeing with that noun, the construction under discussion
is obtained.
Over half of the examples collected so far have pronoun heads. No other
means is available to modify such heads using nouns (recall that adjectives
are constructed solely from adjective or verb roots). The construction is very6.5. Descriptive genitive phrases229versatile, and frequently difficult to translate succinctly into English. Most
commonly the modifying noun, syntactically the possessor of the wu- pronoun, is indefinite, an indication that it is not referential in any way, but is
being used descriptively. The wu- itself may be definite or indefinite:

"14.2.2.1. Basic structure of constituent questions
Constituent questions are doubly marked in Supyire. They contain question
words, which have no non-interrogative function (unlike the corresponding
words in languages like English or French, in which many of the question
words also function as relative pronouns), and they are marked with sentence
final interrogative particles. Three such markers are used. Most of the question words are accompanied by the particle ye. Some speakers also occasionally use bi for these question types.10 Locative questions take the final
marker k6 (usually voiced to g€).
There are five simple question words in Kampwo Supyire, in addition to
the interrogative determiners, for which there are both ordinary and emphatic forms for each of the genders. Table 41 lists these question words.
Only the gender 1 singular interrogative determiners are included; for the
forms of the determiners in other genders see Tables 18 and 19 in chapter S.
'When' and 'why' are missing from the table because they are not simple
question words (see section 14.2.2.3 for 'why' and 14.2.2.6 for 'when').",[556]
"152Chapter 5: Other word classes
Table 6. Declarative first and second person pronouns
PersonSingularPlural1m)iwüu2muyliThe first person singular and both plural pronouns all have a low-weak mid
tone tune. They behave for the most part like low-weak mid nouns with respect to tone rules. In the following examples mli is used, but wüu and yli
would have the same tones if they were substituted. Just as in nouns, the
mid surfaces if the following word begins with a low:
(1) a. mli rjküügi
my chicken.DEF
'my chicken""
b. Mli ä
pa.
I
PERF come
Ί have come.'
Also like low-weak mid nouns, the mid causes a following weak mid (in
certain syntactic constructions, e.g. genitive constructions, verb phrases) to
become high and then is elided:
(2) a. mil ηύψ
my mother.DEF
'my mother'
b. Mu a
ml1 känhä.
you PERF me tire
'You have annoyed me.'cf. nu

ml) ßyä.
s/he PERF me see
'S/he has seen me.'
b. U a
11 cy66 mil nä.
s/he PERF it show me at
'S/he has shown it to me.'
Unlike the nouns, however, the mid remains in a genitive construction when
the possessed word begins with a strong mid:5.1. Proaouns and determiners
(4) m)i15 3bag0my house .DEF
'my house""
The second person singular pronoun mu has a simple strong mid tone tune.
It does not perturb in any known environment.
The vowels of m)i, wilu, and yti are somewhat unusual. They are noticeably longer than ordinary single vowels, but usually not as long as ordinary
long vowels. This may be due to the fact that they are not stressed. However,
it should be pointed out that every other instance of word final long vowels
can be demonstrated to have developed through the elision of a medial consonant. This consonant (usually /l/ or /n/) resurfaces when a vowel-initial
clitic follows the long vowel. In the case of these pronouns, no such consonant surfaces. Instead, the vowels of the pronoun are merely replaced with
the corresponding approximant ([w] for /u/ and [y] for /i/), and an additional
mora is assigned to the clitic vowel, just as if the pronoun vowel were short. 1
For purposes of agreement, first and second person pronouns are in gender
1, which is semantically the gender of human beings. Thus, for example,
when a pronoun in subject position is fronted for focus, the resumptive pronoun which holds its subject position is υ (gender 1 singular) for the singular
and pi (gender 1 plural) for the plural:
(5) a. Mii u
a
Ji pyi.

"9.4.1. The marking of negationIn most ΤΑΜ categories negation is doubly marked in the clause. A clause
final negative particle is obligatory. It is in most tense-aspects supplemented
by a marking in the auxiliary position, i.e. immediately following the subject. This kind of double marking is widespread in central and northern
Senufo languages. In most cases it is not clear what the etymology of the
negative markers is, so it is difficult at this point to say whether the double
marking arose from a reinforcing strategy (with the clause final marking
being added to reinforce the earlier auxiliary strategy) or from some other
source. Whatever the etymological source of the clause final markers, they
are not derived from direct objects in the manner of French pas or English
not, since they come in the wrong position in the clause for that. The most
likely source would be some sort of adverb.",[399]
"When the focused item is a direct object, there is a gap in the presupposed
clause in the direct object position, just as in affirmative clefts:
(16)Wotöröqi u pye u pye
a
0 peri
cart.DEF he be he NEG PERF
sell
'It's the cart that he didn't sell.'me.
NEGExamples with negation of both parts of the cleft were also easy to obtain
by elicitation. They use the negative identifier bä to set off the focused item,
and the presupposed clause is simply negated as an ordinary clause would
be. Note that only one clause final negative particle appears at the end of the
sentence, though both clauses are negated:
(17) Mii bä
υ pye
a
kärd mi.
I
it.is.not s/heNEG PERF go

'It isn't me who didn't go.'
One final point should be noted before leaving the subject of verbal clefts.
Use of the cleft construction to focus the verb is not possible in Supyire, un-12.1. Focus constructions475like in a number of other West African languages (cf. Stahlke 1974, Givön
1990, chapter 16). Only nominal constituents and adverbs can be so focused.
When I attempted to elicit sentences with focus on the verb, I was given examples with the exclamatory particle di, which is widely used not only in
Senufo but also in the surrounding languages. Following is an example:
(18)U a
kärd de!
s/he PERF go
EXCL
'S/he has left! *This particle does not specifically code emphasis on the verb, however, but
rather on whatever item in the sentence is in the focus of assertion. Thus if a
locative adverbial phrase is added to the above example, the focus will be on
it rather than on the verb:
(19)U a
kärd Sukwoo na
s/he PERF go
Sikasso to
'S/he has gone to Sikasso !'de!
EXCL12.1.2. Cleft focus constructions in copular clauses
There are two items which can be focused in equative copular clauses, the
subject and the predicate nominal. Focus on the subject presents no peculiarities: the construction as described in the preceding section is used, with a
resumptive pronoun following the focused noun phrase to show that it has
been focused. Following is both an affirmative and a negative example,
taken from the same folktale:
(20) a. Mu u βγε \νύύ ηύηϊ.
you she be our mother.DEF
'It is you who are our mother.'
b. Mu ba
u jiye \νύύ ηύηϊ
mi.
you it.is.not she be our mother.DEF NEG
'It is not you who are our mother.'
When the focused item is the predicate nominal, however, there are complications. There are two types of cleft construction which focus the predicate nominal. One is used when the subject is a noun, a first or second person pronoun, or an emphatic or demonstrative pronoun. The other is used
when the subject is a simple anaphoric pronoun. The former case is the simpler. The focused item is moved to the front of the clause, just as in verbal
clauses. The subject, however, is postposed to a position after the copula.
The focused item is followed by a resumptive pronoun, just as if it were a476Chapter 12: Focus and topic constructionsfocused subject. It thus looks as if the subject and predicate nominal have
switched roles. Following are some examples:

this.yearWhen the subject is a simple anaphoric pronoun, a more complex construction is used. The focused predicate nominal is moved to the front and followed by a coreferential pronoun, as in the type just described. The subject,
however, is not merely postposed to the copula. It is placed after the copula
in a clause of its own, with a predicate consisting of an identifier pronoun
(see chapter 5, section 5.1.2.6) of the appropriate gender and number. This
extra ""subject clause"" is marked as subordinate by a high tone on the subject
pronoun, rather than the mid-low tune which it normally carries. The high
tone carries over onto the identifier pronoun, which becomes high-low. 7

12.1.3. The contrastive genitive construction
Contrastive focus on a genitive (possessor) noun phrase is indicated by placing a genitive particle u between the genitive and the head noun. This particle has weak mid tone, and behaves tonally as if it were a possessed noun,
becoming high after a mid tone, and low-weak mid after a low tone. It is
obviously related to the independent possessive pronoun root wu- (see
chapter 5, section 5.1.2.11). The head noun following the particle is completely unaffected tonally.
The following examples illustrate the use of u to indicate contrastive focus:8
(24) C:Nümüci sä ä
ke kan...
Numuce go PERF ten give
'Numuce has given ten...
Nbnurugo mu ' rä ä

'Then all that remains (to be given) is your ten.'","[497, 498, 499, 500, 501]"
"QuantifiersThe small set of quantifiers (for the forms, see chapter 5, section S.4) follow
the head noun like the cardinal numbers. They evidently originated as heads
of genitive constructions, and accordingly do not agree with their head noun.
They also undergo tone changes as if they were possessed nouns.
All of the quantifiers are mildly contrastive. They all indicate counterexpectation to varying degrees. Speakers would not generally include them
unless they believed that hearers were inclined, for whatever reasons, to believe wrongly on the point. This is a characteristic which they share with all
restrictive modifiers (see Giv6nT1990, chapter 12).
It should be noted that some meanings which are coded by quantifiers in
languages like English are expressed by other means in Supyire. Partitive
meanings like 'some' and 'one o f are indicated by using the indefinite determiners, as explained in section 6.1.2.1 above. Meanings like 'many',214Chapter 6: Noun phrases'much', Mots o f , 'a few' are usually expressed by means of adjectives derived from verbs, as will be shown in section 6.4 below.","[236, 237]"
"498Chapter 13: Relative clausesFinally, it should be noted that first and second person pronouns can also
function as fronted relativized noun phrases. Note that the agreement pronoun for a fronted subject is a third person gender 1 pronoun, just as in
clefts:

13.2.2. Clause internal relativized noun phrases
Although in the majority of relative clauses the relativized noun phrase is
placed in focus position at the head of the clause, it is also possible to leave
the relativized noun phrase in its ordinary, non-fronted position in the clause.
A non-fronted relativized noun phrase is obligatorily marked with a relative
determiner.8 It would otherwise be impossible to tell which noun phrase in
the clause was intended as the relativized one. This procedure is not much
used for relativizing subjects. It is possible to use it for direct and indirect
objects, as the following examples show:
(17) a. relativized noun phrase = direct object

Freely: 'Then the girl who loved him said to him...'
Not fronting the relativized noun phrase is common when its function is
coding the semantic role of time. Such relative clauses usually function as
time adverbial clauses for the following main clause, and no coreferential
noun phrase appears in the latter:
(18) Näßßiija

Freely: ' When the young man went into the bush, he did not even
look out for bush cows.'
Relative clauses can function as locative adverbial clauses in a similar fashion (see chapter 15, section IS. 1.2).
Just as with fronted relativized noun phrases, non-fronted ones can consist
solely of a pronoun. Only the relative pronouns can be used:500Chapter 13: Relative clauses(19) a. relativized noun phrase = direct object

Freely: 'Isn't it the names of those to whom they ( = the French)

they are seeking?'
Finally, it should be noted that just because the relativized noun phrase is
not fronted does not mean that some other constituent cannot be fronted for
focus. The relative clause in this case takes the form of a cleft focus construction. It is impossible to so translate it in English, however, since relative
clauses of this sort are not allowed. In the following example, the relativized
noun phrase has the role of direct object and is not fronted, but the locative
phrase is focused. The coreferential noun phrase is the subject of the main
clause:

"6.2.1. SimplegenitivesThe genitive construction in Supyire is marked solely by tonal changes. The
genitive (possessor) noun phrase precedes the head (possessed) noun, and
most of the tone changes which are possible in the language affect the head.
Briefly, the changes are: 1) a mid tone genitive raises a low tone head to
mid; 2) a low tone spreads from a genitive onto a following weak mid head;
3) a mid tone genitive raises a following weak mid head to high tone. See
chapter 2 sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 for details of how these rules work.
There is a marked genitive construction which has a genitive particle u between the possessor and the possessed nouns. It functions to encode contrastive focus on the possessor nominal. This construction is described in section
12.1.3 of chapter 12.
Semantically, the genitive construction covers a much wider range of relationships than legal ownership of property. Supyire makes no syntactic distinction between inalienable ""possession"" such as part-whole and kinship relations and alienable possession.
There are no special possessive pronouns in Supyire. Any pronoun except
the reflexives, independent possessives, and identifiers may function as a
genitive. The pronoun agrees with its antecedent and not with the head
(possessed) noun. Determiners may be distinguished from genitives on this
basis:
(23) a. determiner, agrees with head
$k6
ba-g6
DEM(G2S) house-DEF(G2S)
'this/that house' 26.2. Genitive constructions201b. genitive, agrees with antecedent
ήβέ
ba-g6
DEM(GIS) house-DEF(G2S)
'this/that one's house'
If the antecedent happens to be of the same number and gender as the head
(possessed) noun, then the genitive will appear to agree. Here is where tonal
changes are of service. Determiners cause no tone perturbations at all, but in
a genitive construction the floating low tone which follows every definite
pronoun spreads onto the following head noun if it can. If this spread of low
tone takes place, therefore, one immediately knows that one is in the presence of a genitive construction rather than a determiner plus head noun.
Following are some examples:
(24) a. determiner, no tone changes in head
f)g6
ced-rji
DEM(GIS) woman-DEF(GlS)
'this/that woman'

cdd-rji
DEM(GIS) woman-DEF(GlS)
'this/that one's wife'
uru
pwün-ηί
his/her(EMPH.G 1 S)dog-DEF(G IS)
'his/her dog'
The simple determiner/pronoun u, which behaves phono logically as a clitic, does not provide as much help here. If the noun's tune is mid-low, as in
cedyi and pwunrji, the mid-low tune of the pronoun merges with it to produce a mid-low tune over all. Thus u pwugi could mean either 'his/her dog'
or 'this/that dog'. Only when the head noun has a basic weak mid tune does
the floating low of the simple pronoun/determiner provide any distinction,
the low of the pronoun turning up on the noun. Thus 'this/that vervet monkey', with the noun tune intact, is u koorji\ but 'his/her vervet monkey' is u
kodgi.
First and second person pronouns, when they precede nouns, may only be
interpreted as genitives. They cause the same tonal perturbations as nouns
with similar tunes. In the following examples the underlying tones are given
above, the surface tones being marked on the vowels:202Chapter 6: Noun phrases(25) a. LMw MwL-Mw L

The first and second person non-declarative pronouns may be used in genitive constructions in declarative clauses when they are reflexive, i.e. when
they are coreferential with the subject of the clause:
(26) Kä mi) /
nä
yääyi
lwb
and I
NARR my.NONDECL thing.DEF take
'Then I took my things and went...'a

SC goThe non-declarative first person pronouns are also used as genitives in vocatives (ordinary first person pronouns are excluded in this function):

my .NONDECL friend Ζ 'ιέtaä
mu na
where you PROGη-kiig6
ke?
IP-go.IMPFV LOCQ
'My friend Ζϊέ, where are you going?'
Nominal genitives, like pronominal ones, have no special form, the genitive construction being signalled solely by the application of the tonal
changes if the tonal environment is right. Examples with tonal changes are:
(28) a. L
Mw L
Mw Mw
L

-he

pyin-gcYakuba
compound-DEF(G2S)
'Yakuba's compound'
Of course often the initial tone of the head (possessed) noun is not the one
required for a tone rule, and so there is no overt marking of the genitive construction, the two nouns simply being juxtaposed, as in the following examples:
(29)a. kän-hedii-g6village-DEF(G2S) stream-DEF(G2S)
'the village's stream'
b. pytn-gendgd/yd-gfcompound-DEF(G2S)old.man-DEF(G2S)
'the old(est) man of the family'
Multiple genitives are possible:

'his father's house'
b. m)) ηύ-ηϊnu-Jyä-gemy mother-DEF(G 1S) mother-old-DEF(G2S)
'my mother's grandmother'
As stated above, the genitive is functionally like a pre-head determiner,
and therefore does not co-occur with any pre-head determiners. It is compatible with post-head determiners, however:
(31) a. ced-gipyä-yiwäwoman-DEF(G 1 S)child-DEF(G 1S) IND(GIS)
'one of the woman's children'
b. ced-qiΡΥ&-φsän-rjiwoman-DEF(G 1 S)child-DEF(G 1S) OTHER-DEF(G 1S)
'the woman's other child'
In the examples given so far both the genitive (possessor) and the head
noun have been referential and definite. In the following example the geni-204Chapter 6: Noun phrasestive is referential but indefinite. Note that in Supyire the head must also be
indefinite, contrary to the usual practice in English:
(32) ceö-yi
wä
ba-ga
woman-DEF(G 1 S)IND(G 1S) house-G2S
'the house of a certain woman'
When the possessor is no/i-referential and indefinite, the possessed noun
may be definite. Such genitives are widely used to indicate the category of
the head, as shown in the following:
(33) a. mäsäkwü
kbb-g6
sweet.potato field-DEF(G2S)
'the sweet-potato field'
b. si-ge
nii-yi
bush-G2S cows-DEF(G2P)
'the bush-cows'
c. känhä
yätoo-Γέ
village.G2S animals-DEF(G4)
'domestic animals'
This type of ""classifying"" genitive functions like a loose compound. Even
when preceded by a definite genitive themselves, they remain non-referential
(and indefinite in form):
(34) a. u
pyen-ga
sh)in-bii
his/her compound-G2S people-DEF(GlP)
'the people of his/her compound'
i.e. his/her extended family
b. wüu kän-hä
faapyii-btf
puni
our village-G2S farmers-DEF(GlP) all
'all the farmers of our village'
One other use of indefinites in genitive constructions should be briefly
mentioned. The noun känhä 'village, town' when used as the head in a place
name is normally indefinite:
(35) a. Fäägä
Känhä
Farakala village
'Farakala'
b. Sogo
Kanha
Sikasso village
'Sikasso'6.2. Genitive constructions2056.2.2. Genitives with pronominal heads
It was noted above that almost any pronoun may function as the genitive
(possessor) in a genitive construction. Ordinary pronouns may not function
as the head of a genitive construction, however. Instead, a special possessive
pronominal root wu- is used. Wu- is undoubtedly the etymological source of
the genitive particle υ used in contrastive genitive constructions (see chapter
12, section 12.1.3), and like the latter has weak mid tone. It takes ordinary
noun gender suffixes, both indefinite and definite, to agree with its antecedent (see chapter 5, section 5.1.2.12 for the forms). The antecedents are included in the following examples to show this agreement:
(36) a. Ki Zäntüqö si

to Babemba's in Sikasso.'
The possessed pronoun may also be used without an overt antecedent. The
gender 3 singular form is used in a number of expressions to refer to the
general situation or circumstances of the possessor, as in the following:
(37) a. Sigkare wu-ύ-ηΐ
khn),

"460Chapter 11: Complemen t cla usesThe verb ta 'find', which as we have seen above can function as a verb of
both cognition and perception, can take an extraposed subject /»-complement to mean 'be the case that* or 'happen that':
(87) La ä
ta, pi sähä
βγε an/ me.
it PERF find they NEG . YET be there NEG
'It was that case that they weren't yet there.'
A few verbs allow an extraposed subjectless clause beginning with the
same subject conjunction mä. In the following example with the verb ßwoy
the extraposed clause is placed first in the sentence:
(88) Mä ήάέ taha na

Free translation: 'It wouldn't be good to use this to cut the meat.'
A subjectless mä clause can also be postposed. The following example
functions as the subject of 'be a surprise'. Note that the understood subject
of the complement has the same referent as the dative-experiencer of the
main clause:
(89) La ä

Although there are no requirements of coreference with the complements
of verbs in this group, as there are for the complements of manipulative and
modality verbs, there often is coreference in fact. The most common type of
coreference is between the subject of the main verb (the original speaker or
thinker) and some noun phrase in the complement clause. The reason that
this is common is of course because people like to talk about themselves.
Many African languages have special pronouns to use in indirect speech
complement clauses in order to show coreference with the main clause subject. 1 0 Supyire does not have a special set of pronouns for this purpose, but
instead uses the emphatic pronouns {uru, pJre, etc. see chapter 5, section
5.1.2.1.2, for the forms). These are used only for third person, there being no
special first or second person forms. The following examples illustrate this
special function of the emphatics:
(53) a. complement subject = main clause subject

In contrast to the coreferential noun phrase in complements of modality or
manipulative verbs, whose syntactic role is restricted (to subject and direct
object, respectively), the coreferential noun phrase in indirect speech may
have any syntactic role. In view of the unpredictability of its role, the use of
the marked emphatic pronoun to indicate coreference (rather than the unmarked anaphoric pronoun as in the other two complement types) makes
sense. The following examples show the coreferential noun phrase in a variety of syntactic roles.","[466, 467]"
"735positive counterpart ('Monkey is well') rather than the confirmation of
the negative. Note that the English translation 'Isn't Monkey well?' is
biased towards a positive response, whereas the translation used in the
example is not as obviously so biased. There is nothing in the form of
the Supyire corresponding to this difference in English.
In the Supyire culture, the 'chiefs of the earth' are different from chiefs
of villages. The former have a certain spiritual jurisdiction over the
land, but do not actually dispose of it, nor do they have any jurisdiction
over people.
Recall that bi without a question word forms a yes/no question (see
section 14.2.1.1 above).
The reference is to undoing a curse on the land due to a taboo being
broken.
L f r / ' h o u r , time' is borrowed from French l'heure 'the hour'.
Wyere literally means 'leaves'. See chapter 12, note 4.
There are of course sometimes ways of rephrasing the sentence to exclude the use of a serial construction. With the present example the adpositional marking of instrument case role can be used instead of the serial verb marking, and then the direct object of the main verb can be
questioned without difficulty:
flähä u
a

"Cinungo and he(EMPH) NARR ten give

It may also be an adverbial clause, which is also not possible with clefts:
(29)Lämini,u aύ jyäabäriig6,Lamin he PERF it shoot SC wound TC
'Lamin, when he shot and wounded it ( = the elephant),
käniticüubfisijwd...and healthy.ones.DEF NARR say
the healthy ones (i.e. unwounded elephants) decided (lit. said) ...'
The placing of a noun phrase out of its normal position at the head of the
clause creates the same case recoverability problem noted above for clefts.
In left dislocation, this problem is solved in a quite different way. No gaps
are used as they are in clefts: there is always a coreferential noun phrase in
the clause. 9 The topic noun phrase is never accompanied by adpositional
case markers, as it must be in the cleft. The coreferential noun phrase in the
clause may be coded with any of a variety of devices, ranging from anaphoric pronoun to emphatic pronoun to a repetition of the topic noun. Even
the second person singular pronoun mu is sometimes used. The most frequent coding is with an emphatic pronoun, an interesting fact which has
implications for understanding the relative clause construction (see chapter
13).
The topic is sometimes mentioned in the immediately preceding context:

"A comparison with the Cebaara cognates shows that a distinction has
been lost in Supyire. In the plural, Cebaara maintains a difference between simple and emphatic first and second person pronouns:

ydleWhat seems to have happened in Supyire is that the emphatic forms
have merged with the simple forms. The medial [I] was elided, presumably at an earlier date than the general elision of medial [1] which is so
prevalent in the current language. The forms used with clitics mimic the
earlier simple forms. Of course this does not explain m)i, but perhaps
when data from other Senufo languages is added, a similar scenario will
emerge. The simple plural forms also perhaps survive in the non-declarative pronouns (see next section).
The first person singular form na sometimes has a LMw tune when it is
the clause initial direct object in an imperative. The explanation for this
phenomenon is at present unknown.
The corresponding pronouns in Sucite have been labeled 'clitic pronouns' by Garber (1987: 26).
Garber (1987: 26) labels the cognate set in Sucite as 'emphatic clitics',
but the tonal behavior of the set in Kampwo Supyire shows that they are
not clitics in at least that dialect.
This suffix is cognate with the quantifier/adverb πιύ 'also'.
Interrogative pronouns meaning 'who' and 'what' are not integrated
into the noun gender system. They will be introduced in section 5.9 below.
When the diminutive suffix is added to this root it has a HL tune:
numbil§r0[numble:re] 'very small'. This root is used only in the singular, the plural being suppletive (see list). It is related to the noun bild
'seed, small round object, central part, individuated entity' which is
much used in compounds, e.g. zdwbild 'heart', iwüünbild 'peanut',
jonibil6 'testis', canmbiJd 'day'.",[732]

There is an interesting class of systematic exceptions to the use of the emphatic pronouns to show coreference. The verb jwo ' s a y ' has acquired the
quasi-modal senses of 'decide' and ' t r y ' . When it has these senses it still
takes a /7a-complement, but there are two restrictions which make it look
more like the complement of a modality verb: the tense-aspect is restricted
(to either subjunctive or potential) and the subject must be coreferential with
the main clause subject. In view of the latter restriction, it is of interest to
note that the subject in such a complement is not necessarily coded with an
emphatic pronoun. In fact in the majority of cases it is coded with a simple
anaphoric pronoun, as in the following examples:

same subject constraint holds, the extra marking of the emphatic pronoun is
not needed.
Note that, apart from their use in na-complements, the emphatic pronouns
are used in situations of high ""referential interference"", that is, in contexts
where there is more than one possible antecedent in the immediately preceding discourse (see Giv6n 1983). They are often best translated in English as
demonstratives, and in fact they cover in large part the anaphoric function of
the latter (they cannot, however, be used ""exophorically"", i.e. to point to
something outside of the discourse). As shown in chapter 12, section 12.2.1,
the resumptive pronoun for left dislocated topics is most frequently an emphatic. Such topics are usually a switch from the immediately preceding
topic. The resumptive pronoun for preposed noun phrases which are modified by relative clauses is also generally an emphatic (see chapter 13, sections 13.1 and 13.3).","[467, 468, 469]"
