INTRODUCTION79. Squamish words fall into two main classes: full words and clitics.
Full words may consist of a single morpheme, of a reduplication of such a morpheme, or of either of these two combined with one or more affixes. Productive
compounds of free forms do not occur.
The affixes fall into five main categories: (1) personal affixes, (2) modal and adverbial
affixes, (3) relative case prefix, (4) plain nominalizer and verbalizers, (5) others. This
last category is not homogeneous. It contains elements which — besides having a
lexical meaning — nominalize or verbalize a unit to which they are added, and
elements which do not. It contains elements with a clear and concrete lexical meaning,
elements which might be called grammatical, and elements to which no clear meaning
can be ascribed (formatives).
A unit which contains no other affixes than those mentioned under (4) and (5) above
is called a stem. Since the affixes (1-3) are added at the beginning or end of a word,
a stem is a word minus its personal, modal, adverbial and case-affixes (if any).
Disregarding for the moment the occasional nominalizing or verbalizing role of
the affixes (5), we may divide the Squamish stems on the basis of the affixes (4) into
three formal categories: (a) nominalized stems, (b) verbalized stems and (c) unmarked
stems. Nominalized stems contain as their initial part the nominalizer /s-/, e.g.
/s-taq°/ 'water', /s-t'iq 0 / 'cold (noun), cold weather', /s-pcj 'realistic story', /s-qa?q/
'younger sibling'. Verbalized stems contain as their final part an intransitive suffix
/-(V)m(?)/ or one of the transitive suffixes /-(V)t, -s, -(V)n(?), -nsx0/, e.g. /jp'c-m/
'tell, report; itr.', /ta'q°-an/ 'drink; tr.\ Unmarked stems are defined by the absence
of any of these affixes.
If a stem contains both /s-/ and one of the verbalizers, it is nominal, i.e. the IC's
are /s-/ and the remaining part. Particularly common are nominalized derivatives
with itr. /-(V)m(?)/, e.g. /s-js'c-m/ 'news, report'.
Nominal stems can be combined with possessive affixes, e.g. /?n-sqa'?q/ 'my /?n-/
younger sibling', verbal stems cannot. Nominal stems are frequently combined with
identificatory clitics (articles) or demonstratives, e.g. /ta w sta'q°/ 'the water', while
verbal stems are frequently combined with predicative clitics, e.g. / n a ^ y a ^ i o ' c m /64MORPHOLOGY'he is telling, giving a report'; however, both types of clitics are possible with both
types of stems, and this difference in syntactic status is statistical rather than absolute.
Of the stems belonging to the unmarked class, some have the abovementioned
peculiarities of nominal, others those of verbal stems. Among the nominal stems
there are only a small number that represent the simplest lexical morpheme-type CVC:
/man/ 'father', /tai/ 'canoe-race', /5iX/ 'top', /las/ 'bottom', /k ,0 a57 'dogfish', /x°at/
'wren', /ya 1/ 'unidentified plant', borrowings /puS/ 'cat', /lam/ 'whiskey' (Engl, rum),
/ua51 'watch'; with final glottalized sonants /man?/ 'child, offspring', /5'i?/ 'person
who is fasting', /sau?/ 'bone', /lam?/ 'house', /k>0al?/ 'stomach', /?im?/ 'small boy'.
In the overwhelming majority of cases nominal simplicia are represented by longer
forms, e.g. /naiC/ 'hand, arm', /ma'qsn/ 'nose', /Xa'Su?/ 'lake', /Xqaj£7 'moon',
/ki'lala/ 'butterfly'.
The remaining unmarked stems are verbal in character; they are intransitive and
occur in general in the same environments as stems marked by intrans. /-(V)m(?)/.
These verbal stems correspond to English verbs, adjectives, adverbs, numerals and
prepositions; they include the large majority of the morpheme-type CVC, and
longer forms are rare here. As examples may serve the stems with /t, t'/ as first and
/k°, k'°, q°, q J 7 as second consonant: /tek'7 'be tight', /taq°/ 'drink', /tiq°/ 'be
muddy', /tiq'7 'bump, run aground', /t'ak0/ 'get stuck in the mud, get mired',
Vt'ak' 0 , t'3k>0 'dig', Vt'aq"", t'aq' 0 'break', /t'uk'7 'go home', /t'iq0/ 'be cold',
/-t'uq0-/ in /s-t>uq°-£-us/ 'forehead' (the suffix-combination /-i-us/, lit. 'back-face',
means by itself 'forehead'; the presence of the nominalizer /s-/ in this combination
implies the verbal nature of /-t'uq0-/). Within this group only one nominal stem
was recorded, namely the reduplicative formation /t3q°-tu'q°/ 'red codfish, red snapper'.
The meanings of unmarked verbs are given as active or passive according as they
occur in recorded phrases or were given by the informants, e.g. /5-n w ta'q7 means
'I /6-nI drink', /5-n_c J 3'h/ means 'I am hit'. There are cases where both are possible
(cf. English ""he reads the book"" and ""the book reads easily""), e.g. /x°i?/ 'be lost',
'be the loser (in a game)', /653tx°/ 'be decorated with carving', 'carve; itr.'.
In some cases where an unmarked stem was recorded with an English translation
but without examples of use, it is uncertain whether the translation as verb or noun
reflects the true nature of the stem. For example, the meaning of /Xal/ was recorded
as 'a pulling-game with a rope, to see who is strongest'; the word may mean 'tug-ofwar' or 'play tug-of-war', or both.
Unmarked stems containing affixes of category (5) above may be nominal or verbal,
in the same way as simple stems. When their character in terms of noun or verb is
clearly due to the affix, the latter is classed as nominalizing, resp. verbalizing. Most
affixes are neutral in this respect. For details see 163.
Within the class of verbal stems, two categories are set off by certain syntactic and
semantic (in part also morphological) peculiarities: these are the numerals and the
relator-verbs, the latter corresponding to English prepositions.","[60, 61, 62, 63, 64]"
"INTRODUCTION65There is, in addition, a class of substitutes which includes nominal as well as verbal
stems; this class corresponds to English pronouns and pronominal adverbs.
Finally, a very small number of stems is set apart as residual; this class contains a
few words corresponding to English adverbs or adverbial phrases, conjunctions and
interjections.
In addition to full words, Squamish employs a number of clitics. These fall into
two main classes: nominal (identificatory) clitics or articles, and predicative clitics
(a better term might be ""factual clitics""), the latter indicating person, tense, mood,
aspect and other features of predicative expressions (main and subordinate). The
modal and adverbial suffixes (category (2) above) can be attached to predicative
clitics and are often found within strings of the latter, so that it is convenient to treat
these two categories together.
In describing Squamish morphology, we treat first the various types of affixation
(nominalizer, verbalizers, personal affixes, non-personal affixes) and reduplication.
The distinction noun-verb is made, where necessary, within each affixal or reduplicative category. For reasons of expediency, reduplication is treated before
non-personal affixation; this requires fewer references ahead. — Thereafter are treated
the case-forms, the articles, the substitutes, the special verb-classes (numerals,
relator-verbs), the predicative clitics together with the modal and adverbial suffixes,
and the residual words.","[64, 65]"
"NON-PERSONAL AFFIXATION111(7) Verbal stem + neutral affix: /hi-u'jPs/ 'consist of large pieces, be large-chunked',
cf. /hii1, hi-/ 'be large', /-uj?s/ 'chunk, large piece'; this suffix is added to verbs only.
(8) Nominal stem + neutral affix: /sx^ma'n/ 'step-father', cf. /man/ 'father', /sx°-/
'step-'; this prefix is added to nouns only.
Nominalizing and verbalizing affixes are labeled as such; if no comment is given
the affix is neutral. With each affix, all available examples are quoted, except for
cases which are both simple and very common.
A. PREFIXESThe Prefix /Pas-/
164. The prefix /Pas-/, added to unmarked (often reduplicated) stems, has the general
meaning 'one which X-es' or 'one which is X-ed'. It can often be translated by an
English participle or adjective, e.g. /taX°/ 'be settled', /Pas-ts'-tX0/ 'correct, right'
(/5-x°v_uaw?3St3ltX°/ 'you are right'), /lix0/ 'fall down (from a standing position)',
/?asTlii-l?x0/ 'lying, prostrate'; /saq'/ 'crack, split', /?a(s)-s3lqV 'half', /Pa(s)-sa'-sq'/
'cracked, split'. Where the underlying stem by itself denotes a quality, /Pas-/ serves
to ""objectify"" it in a general, abstract way, e.g. /hii1/ 'be big', /?as-(h)ii'/ 'one which
is big' (/ta w ?as-(h)ii' Pn-sVi1?/ 'I want the big one', lit. 'the one which is big is my
desire'; in the same way /ta^Pas-Paci'm/ 'the small one'). The difference with the
nominalizer /s-/ is that the latter nominalizes in a particular, concrete way and
connotes objects or materials with all their inherent attributes, whereas the /Pas-/ form
refers to the single attribute indicated by the stem. The two are not far apart, and /s-/
is undoubtedly a reduced form of /Pas-/ (which itself is a reduced form of the 3rd person
clitic /Pas/).
The meanings of these forms cannot always be mechanically derived from those of
the underlying stems, especially not when the latter have a nominal character, cf.
/qa'nax 0 / 'neck, throat', /?as-qa'nax°/ 'overeaten', lit. 'throttled'; /iua's/ 'wife',
/Pas-£ua's/ 'married (ab. a man)'.
The /Pas-/ forms stand midway between nouns and verbs. Like nouns, they
frequently take articles, but unlike nouns, they do not take possessive affixes (see 206).
Like verbs, they are frequently combined with predicative clitics. Sometimes the
meaning of an /Pas-/ form was given as a verb, e.g. /PasTma'n?/ 'give birth' (with
predicative clitics /na^ua^Pss-ma'n?/ 'she is giving birth') or as an adjective (which
corresponds to a verb in Squamish), e.g. /Pas-q>0u'i/ 'sick' (/ua^Pas-q^u'j/ 'he is
sick'). In other cases the meaning was given as a noun, e.g. /Pas-t'a'-t'k' 0 / 'hole, pit,
well'(with an article/na w x°i l tim tx^t'a'x 0 t-ta^Pas-t'a'-t'k' 0 /'he jumped out of
the pit'). I quote meanings of /Pas-/ forms as given by the informants or required
by examples.
In several instances derivations with /Pas-/ have objective besides qualitative
meanings, e.g. /?as-q°al-q°a?/ 'perforated, pierced', also 'hole'. In a few cases /?as-/112MORPHOLOGYand /s-/ derivatives stand side by side: /Pas-t'aX-t'X-a'Cx0/ 'many-limbed, branchy'
and /s-t'X-a5x°/ 'limb (of a tree)', plur. /s-t'aX-t'X-a'&c0/ (see 146); /Pas-qV-q^P-qs/
'having a perforated nose' and /s-q°a-qs/ 'hole trought the nose', /Pas-q'a'-q^u?/
'accompanying, together with' and /s-q>0u?, s-qV-q^u?/ 'companion', /Pas-na't/
'nocturnal' and /s-nat/ 'night', /Pas-C'q^a'p/ 'having the hair tied up in Indian
fashion' and /s-C'q>0ap/ 'feather in the hair'. The instances where the meaning of an
/Pas-/ derivative was given as a noun concern particularly cases where shapes are
involved: /Pas-p'aq0/ 'slab', /PasTina'-mPk0/ 'lump', /Pas-ca'm-cntfq0/ 'wrinkles', cf. for
the first of these examples /mi'-ka ?3lx°a?-t-c k'i^Pas-p'a'q""/ 'come on, give
/?3'x°a?t/ me /-c/ a slab', where the meaning 'a slab' is a narrowing (concretization)
of 'one which has been made into a slab' or 'one which has assumed the shape
of a slab'. Compare such English nouns as ""a perforation"", ""a swelling"", etc.
Due to the fact that word-initial /?-/ is easily dropped, some of the complexes
with /Pas-/ were also recorded with /s-/; on the other hand, nouns like /s-taq°/ 'water'
are never pronounced with /Pas-/. It is probable that my material contains some
forms with /s-/ which represent incidentally reduced /Pas-/ forms.
All /Pas-/ derivatives which were recorded are summed up below, categorized
according to the shape of the stem. (Excepted are only cases of the type /ta w ?as-(h)ii'/
'the big one' (see above); these are in principle possible with any stem with qualitative
meaning, though only a few were recorded). At the end of each group, I add those
recorded /s-/ forms which semantically and syntactically so closely resemble /Pas-/
derivatives that they probably represent incidental reductions of the latter.
165. With Simplicia.— Roots /CaC/: /Pas-pVq0/ 'slab-like piece, slab', /Pa^-sa'qV
'a piece split-off lengthwise; a half', /Pas-t'a'q>0/ 'a piece broken off; a half (e.g. of a
stick broken in two)', /?3s-q'0u'?/ (/q>0u?/ < */q>3U?/) 'accompanying, companion'
(the latter also /s-q>0u?/), /Pas-ja'u?/ 'seer, fortune-teller', /?as»ma'n?/ 'giving birth'.

as relatum of relator-verb (271).
c. /k°3-k°i 'n?/ 'long (ago) time', a partial reduplication (150) of a \/k 0 in(?) not
recorded by itself; the glottalization in /k°3-k°i 'n?/ may be due to
reduplication (71 sub (3)). The phrase /na 1 ? tk 0 i^k°3k°i'n?/ is a
sentence-adjunct and as such may precede the predicate-expression which
follows (244).
d. / u a w i a ' - n ? - t - m / 'he (they) used to be warned'; V i u h , jah 'be careful', here in
zero-grade (57), with /ph/ reduced to /¿a-/ (18) before the transitivizer
/-n?/ (82, 93), the tr. form being passivized by the itr. suffix /-m/, before
which the tr. suffix is extended with /-t-/ (82). The form is preceded by
the predicative clitic /ua/ (continuous-iterative; 228). A plural-suffix
/-uit/ is lacking; the expression of the plural is not obligatory and is
particularly often lacking when the subject immediately follows (123).
e. /ta w s-ta l u?x°X/ 'the children', pronounced [ t a s t a ' P o x ^ ] (26), a noun marked
by the nominalizer /s-/ (80). It is used in a collective sense — as can be
done with any n o u n — t h o u g h there is a reduplicated plural /s-tu-ta 'u?x°X/
(146). The weak present article /ta/ is used because the referent is unique
and not ""absent"" in a deictic sense (197).
f. /iu'ia's-uit/ 'that they should be careful', a 3rd pers. /-as/ plur. /-uit/ form of
the hypothetical paradigm (132) based on the full grade of V i u h , ¿ah
(see I:Id), here shortened before the junctural glottalization (69 sub d.).
Syntactically the form represents a zero-clause (321).
g. /ha'u q ^ u ^ P a s ^ p ' i ' P - t - a ' s - u i t / 'not for them to take', the part /p'i'Pta'suit/
a 3rd pers. plur. form of tr. /p'iP-t/ 'seize, take' (89); for v V i ? see 62.
The form is negated by /hay/ (256) followed by a /q/-clause of type I l l b
(301), a negative statement being expressed 'it is not the case /hau/ as if
/qI ...'. The clitic /ua/, appearing as /u/ before /Pas/ (56 sub (/)) can
refer to the future in the same way as the present progressive form in
English. /Pas/ is the 3rd pers. clitic (221). I cannot say whether the whole
clause depends on / u a ^ j a ' n P t m / or on /¿u l2 a'suit/.

use of the strong form of the article see 197.
c. /uaX/ general conjunction 'and, while', etc. see 358.
d. /na w ya^X3-X3h-a'm-uit/ 'they were crying'; a partial reduplication (156) of
/Xah-m, Xa-m/, an itr. derivative (108) of a \/X3h. — /na/ 'there, then'
(225,328).3a. /na^mPi^Pu'is/ 'she came in'; clitic /m?i/ 'come (234, 334). — /?ujs/ is
originally bimorphemic, cf. /Pu'J-uA,/ 'put aboard', and is to /?ajs/ 'be
inside' (cf. 1:2b) what /?ucq/ 'go outside' is to /?acq/ 'outside' (78).
b. /k 0 3W w hii' s-Xa'n-aj?/ 'a big woman'. — /k°aXi/ is the feminine counterpart of
/k°3ci/ (1: 2b); /hii'/ 'big' attributive adjunct (259) to /s-Xa. 'n-ai?/ 'woman',
a nominalized derivative of \A.an, Xan(?) 'weave'; for /-ai?/ see comments
in Dictionary under /-ai?/6.
c. /Cm-CmPa'P-s-t-as/ 'she carried on her back', a totally reduplicated (151)
causative (91) derivative of /5m?a'?/ 'carry a load; itr.', probably containing V&>m(?) 'close, be folded' and the formative /-a?/ (187:30). For /-t-/
see I:ld, k; for /-as/ I:If, g, k. Note that the form is finite and not
nominal — the two are formally identical, but the nominal form would
mean 'which she carried' and would be an appositive adjunct (260) to a
preceding noun (such is the case with /nawA,>ilu?.n3x°as/ in 1:17a). A
second, coordinated finite form in a sentence is usually without deictic
clitics (360).
d. /si'tn/ 'basket (generic)'; undoubtedly contains the implement-suffix /-tn/ (186:5).
The type of basket which is carried on the back has the special name
/c'u'PmaSn/.
4a. /ha'u q w .?as w ^,q > i l ?-s-t-as/ 'they didn't know (it)'; differs from 1:1k by the
absence of /u(a)/ because the form refers to the past (299), and by the
absence of /-uit/ because the subject /stau?x°X/ follows immediately
(I: Id, e).
b. /k°iws-ni'X,-s Qa'lqaliX,/ 'that it was Q.'; /niX/ combines the functions of anaphoric pronoun and copula (203, 252), and is here embedded in a
/k°i/-clause (281; 275), with the nominalizer /s-/ and the 3rd pers.
possessive suffix /-s/ (133). A proper name as a predicate lacks an
article (266).
5a. / s - s w m n w c u l t / 'then she said'; /cu-t/ contains the transitivizer /-t/ (cf. /cu-n/
'tell, order someone', see 83) but, like other verbs referring to the
production of sounds (55), is treated as an itr. verb: it lacks the 3rd pers.","[221, 222, 223]"
"APPENDIX*Sapir's suggestions concerning a relationship of Salish with Chemakuan and Wakashan, and of this
""Mosan"" group with Kutenai and Algonquian are based on intuition, and Sapir's intuitions are worth
being followed up. However, so far no adequate testing is possible because of lack of data. Swadesh's
discussion of the Mosan theory (1953) leaves one with a sense of intellectual discomfort. His list of 16
""common features of the three stocks"" (p. 28 if.) on the one hand contains several items which are
quite common outside the limits of Mosan; on the other hand, particularly in the case of Salish
features are listed as common which occur in part of the languages only. Swadesh's statement that
these ""must go back at least to the proto-languages"" is unsubstantiated and gives cause for doubt in
several instances (e.g. the gender-distinction in demonstratives and articles may well be an innovation
of Coast Salish; moreover, this distinction is not made in Wakashan). Again, a list of 10 ""common
structural features"" (i.e. grammatical elements), 8 of which involve demonstratives and other substitutes (p. 31) can be given for many pairs of languages. In fact, about as convincing a case can
be made for a relationship of Squamish and Indo-European, cf. the following resemblances (NB
Sq. /ah, ih, uh/ = [a, e, o], /ah?/ = [a?""]):
Phonology: a. Rich cons, and poor vowel-system, b. Opposition of plain and labialized conss.

forth in some detail.

SUBSTITUTES200. The Squamish substitutes include nominal as well as verbal elements. Some of
them correspond to English pronouns and pronominal adverbs, while others have no
exact parallels in English (e.g. the verb 'to do what?'). The substitutes are divided
into eleven formal categories, which may be roughly labeled as follows: 1. personal
substitutes (201), 2. demonstratives (202), 3. anaphoric element (203), 4-5. determinative substitutes (204-205), 6. possessive substitute (206), 7-8. indefinite substitutes
(207-208), 9-11. interrogative substitutes (209-211).
The nature of these elements entails certain syntactic peculiarities which it is
difficult to state explicitly and exhaustively. Rather than burden the syntax with a
number of laborious statements (which would not be exhaustive), I have preferred to
give some general indications here (reference to which is made in the Syntax), and to
quote examples of use with each of the categories treated below.
Of nominal character are the personal, demonstrative and possessive substitutes,
the determinative substitute /mani'X,/ 'self' and the interrogative substitutes /s-yat/
'who' and /s-tam/ 'what'. Of these, the demonstratives cannot be preceded by an
article, and the use of articles with /s-uat, s-tam/ is limited to two examples. On
the other hand, only the possessive substitute can (and even must) be used with
possessive affixes. Of verbal character are the determinative substitute /PiPi0/ 'all'
and the interrogative substitutes /Pa'nia/ 'be which' and /6a-/ 'do what'. The indefinite substitutes combine the characteristics of nouns and verbs; note that in the
absence of the criterion of combinability with possessive affixes the difference
noun-verb is statistical rather than absolute (see 79).
Personal Substitutes
201. There are separate person-indicators for 1st and 2nd person: /Pans/ 'I', /ni'maty
'we', /nay/ 'thou', /na'u-iap/ 'you'. In the position of predicate they appear without
article: /Pa'ns na^ta'P-s/ '/made it', 7 a m the one who made it', /na'u-i 1 na w hu'i 2 s/
'you apparently /-5'/ ate it', 'it must have been you that ate it', /Pa1 ns sual2u Pi'ta/
7 am the one called Peter', /na'y n-sia'i?/'you are my friend' (cf. /n-sia'i? w 5-x7
'you are my friend').","[141, 142]"

THE NOMINALIZER /a-/80. The nominalizer /s-/ occurs in a large number of fixed combinations with unmarked stems as well as with intransitive (seldom transitive) derivatives. Examples:

/ia'c-m/
'to tell*
(cf. /s-jac/ 'story')
/pah-i'm?/ 'to blow' (wind)
(cf. /puh-t/ 'blow; tr.)
/tV-im?/ 'dig; itr.'
(cf. /t'a'k^-an/ 'dig; tr.')/s-pah-i'm?/ '(the) wind'
/s-t'k'Mm?/ 'pit, dugout'In a number of cases the root was not recorded without intransitive suffix:
/ni'Sim/
'speak; itr.'
/Xi'c'mI
'spark; itr.'
/p'u'X'amI 'smoke; itr.'
/t'lq^'m?/ 'nurse, take the breast'/s-ni'Cim/
'speech, word, language'
/s-Xi'c'm/
'(a) spark'
/s-p'u'X'am/ '(the) smoke'
/s-t'lq^'m?/ 'breast'A fixed nominalization of a trans, derivative (root not recorded without tr. suffix):
/5a'§-nI'send; tr.'/s-Sa'S-n/'messenger'In a number of cases no counterparts without /s-/ were recorded, e.g. /smic/THE NOMINALIZER /s-/67meat', /sX,iq°/ 'flesh', /sqalX/ 'stick for digging clams', /sC'alq's/ 'slingshot', /sX,i'Sm/
'twisted cedar-leaves of which rope is made'. In general, any stem of the type
/sCVC.../ may be regarded as an /s-/ derivative of a stem /CVC.../, except, of course,
for cases where /s/ belongs to the root and a suffix /-VC.../ is involved, as in /sq'-im?/
'split wood; itr.', where the root is /sq'-/> cf. /saq'/ 'crack, split lengthwise; itr.', in
this example combined with the active-intrans. suffix /-im?/.
In a few cases forms with and without /s-/ occur side by side, e.g. /(s-)tqa'ia?/
'wolf', /(s-)c'na'i?/ 'bullhead', /(s-)5'iu'i/ 'twins'. The words /s-taj?6/ 'back' and
/s-?a'cus/ 'face' may be used with and without /s-/ when they refer to the back, resp.
front, of a house, and not to parts of the body. Note /k°ci?c/ 'person with magic
power' versus /s-k°ci?c/ 'relative'.
81. Besides occurring in fixed combinations referring to objects, i.e. in nouns, the
nominalizer /s-/ may as a result of a living grammatical procedure be combined with
any verbal stem (and also with certain predicative clitics) to refer to a fact. In the
most frequent type of case, such a nominalized verb-form is accompanied by a
possessive affix, and the whole expression takes the indefinite article /k°i/, e.g.
/k°iwn-STnil5im/ 'the fact of my /n-/ speaking', 'that I speak', /k^^n-Srna'm?/ 'the
fact of my going', 'that I go'. Note that there is a noun /s-ni'Cim/ 'word, speech,
language' (/ta^n-Srni'iim/ 'my word, speech, language', with the definite article /ta/);
on the other hand, there is no noun */s-nam?/. For this use of /s-/ see 133, 135.","[65, 66, 67]"
"XXVII
¡X/-C LAUSES304. /ty-clauses correspond to English subordinate clauses introduced by a relative
adverb (why, where, when, how) or by a relative pronoun which is not the subject or
object of the clause ('about whom', 'with which', etc.; see 275). Such clauses are
preceded by articles where these are required (see 266ff.). They fall into two main
types. In type I the subject of the clause is referred to by a personal clitic following /X/;
in type II the subject is referred to by a possessive affix; these affixes may be added to
/X/ by itself or to a phrase consisting of /X/ plus a following clitic or verb or both:
I. /X w ?an .../, 3 sg. /X w ?as .../
II. /(?)nrX^.../, 3 sg. A - s o r/X w ...-s/The two alternatives with possessive suffixes in II are sometimes a matter of free
choice; for an example see 308.
Type I
305. Type I occurs in subordinate subject-clauses, almost exclusively with predicates
referring to a quantity of time(s): /£ana'x° X w ?an^.X > i 1 q t-ti'ua/ 'I've been here
three times', lit. 'thrice is when I've arrived here', /qaXa'X X ^ P a n ^ W q t-ti'ua/
'I've been here many times', /k>0ina'X X w ?ax° w X.'i l q t-ti'ua/ 'how often have you
been here?', /k°uk°i'n? X^Pan^hu'i.nax 0 / 4I finished it long ago', 'I've had it ready
for a long time', /k°uk°i'n? A.^?as^,ua w ?i'/ 'he has been living here for a long time',
/k°uk°i'n? J i ^ P a n ^ u a ^ p ' l X t / 'I've been looking for it for a long time', /k°uk°i'n?
X^_,?an^_,ua^?i?a'i?sim?/ 'I've been waiting a long time'. In two examples the clitic
/ua/ precedes the personal clitic: /k°uk°i'n? ^ w u w ?an^,A.q > i'?st-umi/ 'I've known
you for a long time'; the other case is the only one I have with a predicate not referring
to time:/?i'?i° sta'm X w u w ?as^x°3'k°st-as ta w su'k 5 °am/'for everything they
use cedar-bark', lit. 'everything is what they use cedar-bark for'.
Type II
306. The cases of type II fall into three categories. In the large majority of cases (Ila)/^/-CLAUSES197the /X./-clause is preceded by the clitic /ua/ (1st pers. sing. /ua^n-rX,.../, 3rd pers. sing.
/ua^_,X,(^...)-s/, etc.). In type lib, no clitic precedes the subordinate clause. In
type lie, a clitic /k >0 a/ precedes /X,/, /nrX,/, etc.
Certain /^/-clauses of type II have practically achieved the status of lexical units,
e
-g- /ua^n»X w tina'?/ 'where I am from' = 'my place of origin', /ua^X^tina'P-s/
'his place of origin', /ua^n.X-^tina'n.na'Pt/ 'my late father', lit. 'the late one I am
from' (see 46,186:3); in the same way / u a ^ n A ^ P m P u t / 'where I sit' = 'my abode'.
The cases of type lie all belong to this type: /k'°a w ,n*X,^ya w Xa l m/ 'with whom I
cry' = 'my fellow-mourner' (see Dictionary).
307. Type Ila comprises first of all causal clauses (English '(the reason) why ...'):
/ni'X^maX, ua w X-s s _,ya w A, > 3qtA,'a l qt§n/ 'that's why he is long-legged' (11:12),
/... ua_n»X,^ua^_X.>3qtX.>alqtsn/ '... why I am long-legged', /timPa'^maX,
ua_nTA.^na._cut/ 'that's why I said', lit. 'accordingly is why ...',/... ua^X(,_na)s w c u t / '... why he said', /tim?a' w maX ua^n-rX-^Pi^timPa 1 t-ta'j?/ 'that's why I
am that way (why I look like that)', /timPa'^maX, ua w X,-s w tim?a 1 / 'that's why it
is so', /timPa'^maX, y a w X . w n a - s w u i l ? x ° m / 'that's why it fell down', /tim?a' w maX,
ua_X, w nai?-x°-s ua^?3sXi'c-x°/ 'that's why he was still lying down' (111:5),
/... ua^nxX-^na'Px 0 ua^PasXi'cx 0 / ""... why I was still lying down', /?3sa'n? w maX,
ua_(?3-)X._na_naim? X,'a^SqX°ulPmiS/ 'why did you go to Squamish?', lit. 'why
is why you went to S.?',/PaSa'nP^maX, ua^(?3-)X,_na w m?i l t-ti'ua/'why did you
come here?', / 5 - x ° ^ u a ^ £ a l n m ua^,(?3)X, s _^na^ua w .na l m? t-k°a l ci/ 'why are you
going there?', lit. 'what do you do why you are going there?'. In a clause derived
from a negative sentence the possessive affixes are added to the combination /X,w h a u / ,
e.g. /PaSa'nP^maX, ua w X, w .ha l u-s q w ?as^,h3m?i'/ 'why didn't he come?'.
In all of the above examples, the /X,/-clause is preceded by a demonstrative or
interrogative substitute. This is not the case in /?i'a*uit ni'X.-S' m3lk°tn-s-uit ti'ua,
u a w X , w m n ^ h u ' i - s w m a X . ti^sPa'cus-uit ?i w ?3sx°i l x°i?/ 'those must be their
blankets there, since only their faces are visible' (IV: 9); here the possessive suffix /-s/
is added to the complex / X , ^ m n w h u l i / lit. 'because of which (it) is only ...'.
308. Type Ila comprises furthermore local clauses (English '(the place) where ...');
unlike the causal variety treated above, these clauses are often found in positions
where an article is required. Examples: /nas_^uilPx°m t-k°3ci s _ua^X,-S3t w ta l P5n/
'it fell down where we were standing' (also /t-k^ci^ua^X-^ta'Psn-Cat/),
/ua^nrX, w tina'P ta^Pa'lqsn/ 'I am from Point Grey', lit. 'where I am from is ...',
/ua^nTX, w Pm?u l t/ 'my abode', lit. 'where 1 sit', / i - n ^ n q ' a ' k t - t a w u a w ( ? 3 - ) X , ^
n3x c ta'?/ 'I put it in your way', lit. 'I put it in the way with regard to /t-/ by which
way you go', also /... t - t a w . u a w , X , _ n a ^ u a ^ n 9 x ° t a 1 ? / 'w.r. to by which way you
are going', /ni'X, u a w X , - s w u a w n . n a ' P k°9ci^n-?aX,ta'£/ 'that's where my parents
were', /naxVna'nPp (t-)ta ua^X.-s^na'nam?/ 'follow her trail', lit.'... where she was
going' (111:16). A point in time is referred to in /na^,k°^,ci l x° k ° a ^ u a ^ n r X , ^198SYNTAXhuja1?/ 'it's time for me to leave', lit. 'has come the (point) where I depart'.*
/ty-clauses of this local type can be used as alternatives for relative independent
adjuncts (see 264): /k°3ciwq>3q>i?als ua w X-s w ?3sn?i l u? k°3civ_mlal§is/ 'the barrel
in which the molasses were' (IV: 25; cf. also IV: 29). They can also be used independently as noun-phrases, cf. the use in the function of object in /s-s_,mn^p > i?t-as
k°aci_ya w X-s w ?3sn?i l u? k°3ciw.sta'q0/ 'then he took a container with water',
lit. 'a (thing) in which there was water' (111:11).
309. Only one example of a modal clause was recorded: /na_t3?a'u?n k°iv_s-ni'X,-s
ua w X, w ya-s w tim?a' tawst3ll.m3X° k°i^s-p'a?a'iiaX/ 'he thought that that was
how the Indians shook hands' (IV: 19).
310. In addition, /X,/-clauses of type Ila were recorded in the following special expressions: /ha'u-q ua^n-rX^na 1 ?/, 3rd pers. /ha'u-q ua^X. w na'?-s/ 'it is none of
my (his) business', lit. 'there is not on (or: for) which I am'; /5-n w t > a l nam?n
k°a,^.ua_ (?3-)X_ sti 'PsC/ 'I measure how tall you are'.
311. Of type lib I can give but a single example:/ni'X ta'i? nTX,_.na w ua^tx°t3'ta/
'that's the one whom I was discussing', lit. 'about whom ...', cf. /2-n v _ua w tx°t3 l ta
X'a^na'y/ 'I am discussing you'. Notice that here the /ty-clause refers to an
objective (rather than causal, local, modal) secondary relatum in the corresponding
main clause (English ""about you"").
312. The cases of type lie correspond to English expressions like 'fellow-villager',
'co-worker', with this proviso that in Squamish 'my fellow-worker' is expressed
approximately 'with whom I work'. The /^/-clause is here preceded by a clitic /k>0a/
which is found only in this type of expression. Examples: /k^a^nrX, w u a _ X a ' m /
'my fellow-mourner', lit. 'with whom I cry', /k , °a w X_ua-53t w Xa l m/ 'our fellowmourner', /k'°aw A,^,sta 'u?x°X-s/ 'his fellow-child(ren)' (1:13), /k'°aw A,w ? u 'x°umix°-s/
'his fellow-villagers' (IV:3), /k>0awA,wua-S3twc>ic>a'p> ?i'ci*uit/ 'we work together
with them' (LM), lit. 'with whom we work are those'. Notice that the possessive
suffix follows the clitic if there is one, otherwise the full word.
I have recorded two examples of a type of clause where /ty appears twice:
/k'°a w X, w .ua^_k-s w t w ua w ,sk°u'l/ 'who used to go to school together', /k >0 a w X. w
ya w X-s w ,t w ua w X3 l i*/ 'who used to fight (go to war) together'. Here the complex
/ k , 0 a w t y is apparently treated as a single unit meaning 'together'.","[195, 196, 197, 198]"
"41SPECIAL QUESTIONSIn a few cases geminates occur word-initially, e.g. in the phrase /ua^,X»sw u a w n.na'?/
'where they (persons) were'; here /n.na1?/ is a form of the morpheme /na?/ 'at'
mentioned above. Since reference to persons in several cases entails reduplication
in Squamish, gemination is considered to be a special type of reduplication (see 162).
In the medial cases, the reduplication is the primary phenomenon, from which the
double stress and the appearance of /s/ in unexpected places result.
C. SVARABHAKH VOWELS47. In a few words of the shape /CVR(?)C/ variants with a svarabhakti-vowel between
/R/ and /C/ and without glottalization were recorded. The instances are the following:
[CVR«C]
[Xe'jpX][CVR?C]
[Xei?X][tt'i'q1]
[scV 'uSq']
[U'm^x 0 ][sc'e-uPq*]
[Um?x°][CVRC]
[XejX]/Xi?X, XajX/ 'war'[sc'e-uq'-]
—A'aiqV 'get trapped'
/s-c>iu(?)q>/ 'elderberry'
/tamPx0/ 'rain'The variants with svarabhakti-vowel resemble the Halcomelem forms (Cowichan
Xa'ylaX, ?'i 'w3q\ s-ta'max""); since in Squamish a type /CVRaC/ is very rare while
/CVRPC, CVRC/ are common (see 65), I regard the latter forms as optimal, and in
particular the form with glottalization, of which that without may be regarded as a
reduction. In the word 'war' the form /Xaj[X/ is the most frequently used, and alternative forms are recognized; note that /Xi?X = XajPX/. Of A'ajq'/ no alternative
with glottalization was recorded, but a glottal stop may easily have escaped notice
before glottalic /q'/, see 45. With 'elderberry' a form CVRC was recorded only in
the derivative /s-c'i'uq'-aj?/ 'elderberry-tree'. In all three cases with glottalization,
the variant with [?] after the full sonant was recorded.
48. In word-initial position a sequence of /n/ plus uvular is pronounced with an
anaptyctic vowel [a, ae] in between. All instances concern the prefix /n-/, alternant
of /nax0-/ (locational), see 169ff. When a clitic ending in a vowel precedes, the
anaptyctic vowel is facultative. Examples: /n-q'aX/ [naqVX, naeqVX] 'be in the
way', /n-q°u'?us/ [n3q°o'?os] 'tears' (cf. before a non-uvular cons. /n-ti'q>0us/
[nte -l q >0 os] 'bump one's head'). Where such a vowel remains absent between /n-/
and a following uvular, the initial /n-/ is secondary and results from /?n-/; these
cases all concern the 1st pers. sing, possessive prefix /?n-/, where /?/ is often dropped,
see 44, and where this prefix in its form /n-/ occurs before uvulars I write /n»/
(where /./ indicates the absence of an anaptyctic vowel), e.g. /ta w nTq'a l i?q/ 'my chair'.
An anaptyctic vowel is also heard between the combination /n-s-/ (consisting of
the abovementioned prefix /n(ax°)-/ and the nominalizer /s-f) and a following consonant proper; the only instances are /n-s-t'q'i'us/ 'side of body' and /n-s-Xa'?Xm/
'wild pigeon', pronounced with an initial [nsat'-, nsaeX-]. Such a vowel remains42PHONOLOGYabsent in /ns-qi'n-m/ 'rub oil in one's hair', where /ns-/ is a root (cf. /s-na's-qn/
'hair-oil'), and also in all cases where the 1st pers. sing, possessive prefix /(?)n-/ is
added to stems beginning in /sK/. Since the latter cases are very common, whereas
the svarabhakti-vowel was recorded in two words only, I write only /nsK.../, giving
a reference to pronunciation [nsaK] where necessary (technically, of course, the
distinction should be expressed /nsK/ with schwa, and /ns.K/, resp. /(?)nsK/ without).
49. There are a few other cases where svarabhakti-vowels — mostly facultative —
occur before uvulars, e.g. in /t(3)X°l?a'm?/ 'truly, completely', /Pi (?)&""/ 'all'. Not
facultative is the schwa in /q>°aj?q>0ali?3X/ [-a- 'iPjeX] 'shy, wild' and in the suffix
/-ai?3q% reduced /-iPaq0/ [-aipjoq0, -U?ioq°, -iPaq0] 'top of head'. I do not write
/-aX, -aq°/ in these cases because the second one clearly represents a combination of
the connective element /-aj-/ and the suffix /-q°/ 'head' (184) with so-called junctural
glottalization (see 70); on the other hand, these combinations differ markedly from
the final part of /Pa1!?*/ [Pa-'*??1*] 'crab' and from the medial part of /x°a'i?q°m?/
(recorded [-a- 'i?q°-]) 'wash one's head'. I think a particular combination of glottalizing
and juncture-factors is responsible here (for types of glottalization see 67-73), and I
write /a/ (see 75).
D. EXCEPTIONAL VOWEL-TYPES50. In a few words a long diphthongal [e'j] occurs, in phonemic transcription /ijj.
In some of the instances morphological evidence shows that reduplications of forms
with /i, i/ are involved (see the plural forms below, and cf. 146) and this is probably
the case in the remaining instances too. The cases are the following: /si 'ia[?/ 'friends'
(reduplicated plural of/s-ja'i?/ 'friend'), /si'i?ulx0a/ [se-'i?icr'x°a] 'old people' (red. pi.
of /s-iu'Piux°a/ 'old person'), /si'jPam?/ 'chiefs' (red. pi. of /s-(h)i?a'm?/ 'chief'); the
remaining instances are /ti'jPuiX/ [te- 'j?ueX] 'be protected' (cf. /ti'uPi^-n/ [te-'wPueXg]
'protect; tr.') and /Pi'ici/ 'those' (alternative form of /Pi'ci/). Here also belongs the
case /ci'ia'Cis/ already discussed in 46.
51. In three sound-imitative words stressed short vowels were recorded which deviate
from the normal variant-pattern of /a/. They are /k°3'm-i?n/ [k°ulme?u] 'make a
thumping noise' and its reduplication /k°3f-k°m2m/ [k°u'k0-], and /q0a'-q0aX,q-m/
[q0u'q0-], a reduplication of /q°3'X,q-m/ 'rap, knock', itself recorded with a normal
variant of /a/. No special notational device is adopted for these words; in the
Dictionary their pronunciation is indicated by [u1].
E. CLITICS52. Clitics occur very frequently in texts, and in the large majority of cases they form
a stress-unit with the word that follows them. Often strings of three or four of themSPECIAL QUESTIONS43are found together. In principle, the rules for unstressed vowels (35-38) apply in the
same way to clitics, except that the tendency to reduction is even stronger here than
elsewhere, and sometimes groups of clitics tend to merge into simplified forms.
For reasons of expediency, in monosyllabic clitics with schwa and which consist
of a combination of a morpheme /C-/ with a suffix /-C/ the symbol /a/ is not written.
The cases in question are the combinations of the auxiliary /5-/ with the 2 sing, and
1 plur. subject-suffixes /-x°, -t/: /£-x°, 6-t/; the clitic /s-s/ (see 135), and the combination
of the relative clitic fk/ with the 3rd pers. possessive suffix /-s/: A-s/. These units are
pronounced [Cax0, 5at, sas, tas], with the appropriate, but strongly reduced variants
of schwa. In the single case where a clitic CC is pronounced without possible schwa,
the symbol /./ is used, viz. in the clitic /n.X,/ (morphologically /n*Xf) meaning approximately 'which I, where I, why I . . . ' ; the /n-/ here is the 1st pers. sing, possessive prefix
already discussed in 44, 48. The symbol /./ is also used in the comparatively rare
cases where a clitic /CC/ (see above) is extended with a suffix /-C/, always without
intervening schwa, e.g. /5x°.57 (morpholog. /5-x°»6')/ [53x°S'].
53. After a clitic ending in (or consisting of) a consonant a stem-initial /m, n, 1/ is
not syllabic, e.g. / n a w k 0 w n u ' q 7 [nok°no-lq°] 'it is noontime now'. The same rule
holds between clitics, e.g. the combination / s s ^ m n w / 'then he ...' is pronounced
[sasmg]. A clitic consisting of a single consonant does not normally merge with an
identical initial stem-consonant, e.g. /na w k°_.k°3 l mi?n/ [nok°k°ulme?5t] 'they made
a thumping noise' (I, 14). In the case of longer clitics such coalescing is common,
and between clitics it is the rule, e.g. the combination / m n w n a m w / is usually
pronounced [mpaem].
54. The initial /?/ of a clitic may be dropped after a consonant proper, but it is
facultatively preserved, and this distinguishes clitics from suffixes (see 69). In particular, this characteristic distinguishes the personal clitics 1 sg. /Pan/, 1 pi. /?at/,
2 sg. /?ax% 2 pi. /?a(ia)p/, 3 sg. (pi.) /Pas(-uit)/ from the otherwise identical suffixes
/-an, -at/, etc.
55. The clitic /s-s/ (nominalizer /s-/ combined with 3rd pers. possessive sufF. /-s/)
when preceded by the article /k°i/ [k°e] is pronounced /sis/ [ses], an instance of
progressive vowel assimilation. Where morphemes are separated I write /k°i w s-i-s/
in order to avoid introducing an allomorph and having to assign /i/ arbitrarily to
either affix. A similar assimilation occurs in the combination /k°i w s-ua-s w /
[k°esyaes], also /k°i w s-yi-s w / [k°esues], and in /k°i w s-ni-s w / [k°esnes] (see 135);
these combinations contain the same morphological elements as /k°i w s-i-s_/ except
that the zero-element between /s-/ and /-s/ is replaced by the clitics /ua/ 'continuously',
resp. /na/ 'there'. Besides progressive vowel-assimilation, analogy to /k°i w s-i-s w /
may therefore play a role here.","[40, 41, 42, 43]"
"13SMORPHOLOGYIn some cases the mere impossibility of the object's conceivably being pointed out
by the speaker allows or necessitates the use of an indefinite form, even though the
object is independently identified for the speaker. Such is the case with references to
deceased relatives, and to past and future time-periods.
Factual forms (see 133f.) require the indefinite article /k°i/ in subordinate clauses,
see 275-283.
191. Here follow examples of the various types of use, mainly of indefinite forms;
more examples of the definite category will be given when the subdivisions of the
latter are discussed. /sa't-Sit-ka t a ^ s t a ' q 0 / 'give him the water /staq 0 /!' versus

192. The indefinite forms often occur in questions: /sta'm k ° i s _ n a w u a w k M a l 5 .
nox°-ax°/ 'what do you see?', lit. 'what is that which you see?'. In this example the
object seen is not independently identifiable for the speaker. Compare: /sta'm
t i ^ n a ^ u a ^ t a ' P - s - t - a x 0 / 'what are you making?'. Here the speaker is questioning
an addressee whom sees at work on something. The question could be translated
'what is this you're making?', with a stress on 'is'. Compare also /t'a'm-at^fi-x 0
ta, w ,na w ua w Pi'p > is-t-an/ 'guess what I have here'. Here, too, the object is identified
for the speaker. This is not the case in the following questions: /sua't k ° i w , n a w q ° a l qs-an-t-umi/ 'who perforated your nose?', lit. 'who is the one who perforated your
nose?'; /k>0i'n-k>0n k >0 i w P-ma'nP-rmn/ 'how many children have you?'; /na w Pa'n5a
k^^la'mP-s k ° a ^ ? - m 3 'n?/ 'where is your son's house?'; /na^_Pa 'n£a k^^Pa-sX-'i'?/
'which one do you want?'; /ci'P^Pu k°i w P-la l m?/ 'do you have a house?', lit. 'is
there (available) a house of yours?'.
193. The indefinite forms are used with words referring to deceased relatives when
these contain the past suffix /-t/ (see 186:3). The use of this suffix, and hence of the
indef. form, is not obligatory. Examples: /k°i^_n-k°u l pic-t/ 'my deceased elder
brother', /k°s w n-k°u l pic-t/'id. sister'; cf. also /k°s w nTsq >0 u'?-t/ 'my deceased wife'
(V:8, 16), and with a pronominal reference to the same person: /k°s w mani'A.-t/
'she' (V:17). On the other hand, LM referred to his (deceased) parents asNOMINAL CLITICS (ARTICLES)139/k°3ci w n-?aXta'd/ and to his father as /k°a w n»ma'n/, though he considered
/ k ° i w n T m a ' n - t / more correct.
194. References to past and future time-periods: /k°i. .ClPa'qX/ 'yesterday', / k ° i w
tpa'nu/ 'last year', /na 1 ? t - k ' ^ k ' W i ' n ? / 'long ago', /k°i^.Xa'u?s X.qa'j57 'next

(but cf. /ti w s-ci'?-s/ 'today', lit. 'this /ti/ its /-s/ being there /ci?/ (with nominalizer
/s-/)'). Reference to an (as yet) unidentifiable object in the future / u a w 5 - a ' x c w ? a q >

/sta'l.max 0 /'.
195. Examples of factual forms: /hi'n? k°i w n-s-?i 1 / 'I'll stay here for a long time',
lit. 'long (is) my being here', /C-n^X&'us k°i s _.n-s-ua w c > ic > a l p > / 'I'm tired of
working', /?3ci'm k°i w n-STna w ua w ni l 5im/ 'I speak (a) little'. See for other
examples 275-283.
Present — Non-Present
196. Within the definite category, which may be said to refer to objects which could
conceivably be pointed out by the speaker, there is a distinction between that which
can be pointed out, more exactly, which is an element of immediate experience, in the
speech-situation (present), and that which is not (non-present). Thus, one says /hamPi1
k ° a w T a ' m / 'Tom will come' (said in answer to the question 'will Tom come?') but
/ n a w k ° w h a m ? i ' t a _ T a ' m / 'Tom is coming' (/na/ 'there', /k°/ 'now'; said when
Tom is seen approaching); /C-n^q^u'irnax 0 k°3ciwmilXaX, k°i, .CIPa'qX./ 'I killed
a /k°aci/ bear /mi'XaX./ yesterday'; /t'i'q 0 k ° a w ? a l c q / 'it's cold outside', lit. 'cold (is)
the outdoors' (said inside the house); / ? i ^ u a w t x ° n 6 a ? a l m ? k ° a w P i l t a / 'how is
Peter (absent)?'.
When the referent of a word is the class and not a specimen, the present form is
used: /na w ua_n-s-?ip > a l q > 0 aX ta w mi l Xaty 'I'm afraid of bears', lit. 'it is my
fearing, the bear', /6-n w qi'-s ta w sXa l m?x°/ 'I dislike rain'.
The categories present and non-present are of the unmarked-marked type. The
present forms can be used for things absent (in the same way as in English the present
can be substituted for the past tense), but not vice versa. In stories (as opposed to
conversations which are strongly bound to the here-and-now), present forms often
creep in: the speaker momentarily shifts his frame of reference from the speechsituation to that of the story. For instance, in text V the canoe is referred to with
/k°aciI in 3, 8 and 19 but with /ta/ in 16; the bear is referred to with /k°aci/ in 4, 10,
18, 21, 22, but with /ti/ in 11 and 20.
Weak — Strong
197. The opposition weak-strong roughly parallels that between English article and
demonstrative pronoun, except that the Squamish ""strong"" forms can also occur as140MORPHOLOGYclitics, and in these cases English would have an article or zero (see below). As in
English, the weak forms, which merely identify, cannot be used independently; the
strong ones, which are deictic in the narrower sense, can be used by themselves.
The weak forms are used in the first place with unique objects, including proper
names: /ta w n*m3'n?, k°a w nTm3'n?/ 'my son; pres., abs.\ /ta_sn3'q°m/ 'the sun',
/na1? t-k°a_?a'iaX,q7 'down below', /na'? t-k°a w 5i'Sm/ 'higher up', /PasnPi'u?
t-k°a w ,k >0 a'x°a?/ 'in the box' (the addressee knows the box, and the box is in another
room), /na w ?a'n5a k c Xa^5i'Sa?/ 'where is (your) mother?', /ta w Ta'm, k°a^Ta'm/
'Tom', also with personel pronouns: /ta_?a'ns/ 'I', / t a w n a ' u / 'thou', / t a w n i ' m a V
'we', /ta^na'u-jap/ 'you, pi.'. In the second place, the weak form /ta/ can be used
for non-unique referents which have been mentioned before and therefore are readily
identified; this usage requires a previous reference with a strong form.
The strong form /ti/ is very often used with nouns which have a 1st pers. possessive
prefix, but only if the object referred to is close by: /ti w n-sq°ma'i?/ 'my dog here',
/ti^nrlam?/ 'my house' (said inside it by the owner), /ti w n-s?a'cus/ 'my face'.
In telling stories, LM very often uses the strong form /Pa^i/ (instead of /k°aXi/ or
/Xa/), whereas the corresponding masc. form /taj?/ is not used as a clitic at all, but
only as a (stressed) demonstrative.
The strong form /k°oci/ is used when new things or persons are introduced in a
story or report, cf. / n a w m ? i ^ ? u ' i s k°aX.iwhii' sXa'nai?/ 'a big woman came
in' (1:3), /na1? t-k 0 3ci^n5 5 u'? na'tX/ 'one morning', 'on a certain morning' (IV: 1),
/ n a ^ k ^ c u ' t k ^ c i ^ ' n S ' u ' P sta'l.max0/ 'one Indian said ...' (IV:9) (cf. the usage
in American slang ""suddenly this cop appears from nowhere and gives us a ticket"").
One says /na^C'a'mP-t-as k°3ci^sui'?qa/ 'he has bitten a man', reporting on a dog
that has misbehaved.
For independent use of the strong forms see the next section.
Proximal — Distal. Independent Forms198. Within the present strong category there is an opposition proximal-distal which
parallels English 'this' vs. 'that'. The two may be opposed in stressed use only so
that this opposition belongs to the demonstrative substitutes (202) rather than to the
articles; however, both proximal and distal forms are used as articles (see 197). And
even stressed I can oppose the two in independent use only: /ti1 Pi1 ta'j.?/ 'this
one and that one'; dependently, only /ta'j?, ?a'A,i/ are represented in my notes:
/sua't ta'i? sui'Pqa/ 'who is that man?', /sua't Pa'Xi sXa'nai?/ 'who is that
woman?'. The independent proximal form is usually extended with an element
/-ua/: /ta'i? Pi ti'ua Pi ci'ua/'that one and this one and this one'(pointing to
three children, the third one a girl). The non-present does not distinguish proximal
and distal forms: /ha'?A, w ?u ti'ua/ 'is this (present) one good?', /ha'PX^Pu ta'i?/
'is that (present) one good?', / h a ' ? k w ? u k°a'ci/ 'is it (absent) good?', 'is this/that
(absent) one good?'.","[137, 138, 139, 140]"
"Plur./?n-//-ö(a)t /
/?a-...-iap/1*1/-s-uit/86MORPHOLOGYAll three sets comprise 1st, 2nd and 3rd pers. sing, and plur. They have in common
the plural suffixes /-uit/ and /-¿ap/, referring to 3rd and 2nd pers. respectively (except
that in one type of form /-uit/ refers to 2nd pers. object, «ee 133). The expression of
the plural of a 3rd pers. object is facultative. The plural of a 3rd pers. subject is
often not expressed when the subject-noun immediately follows.
124. Object-suffixes.— The object-suffix for 1st pers. sing, is /-c/ with the transitive
suffixes /-(V)t-, -s-t-, -(V)n-t-/, and /-ms/ with the trans, suffix /-n-/ (alternant of
/-n9x% see 82). Example: /na^p'i'P-t-c-as/ 'he /-as/ grabs /p'i?-t-/ me' versus
/na w p'i l ?-n-mS-as/ 'he holds /p'!?-n-/ me' (from /p'iP-nax0/ 'hold', see 84).
The object-suffix for 2nd pers. plur. /-umi-ap/ consists of the 2nd pers. sing, suffix
/-umi/ extended with a suffix /-jap/ which recurs among the subject- and possessive
affixes; the initial ¡\/ of this suffix merges with the final /i/ of /-umi/.
125. Subject-suffixes.— The subject-suffix for the 2nd pers. plur. /-aiap/ is usually
shortened to /-ap/, even under a stress.
In unstressed position, all subject-suffixes except that for 2nd pers. plur. often
appear in reduced form, with /a/ instead of /a/; the form without /a/ is the only one
used in unstressed combinations with the clitic /£-/ (see next paragraph).
The subject-suffixes for 1st and 2nd person are often combined not with the full
stem itself but with the clitic /5-/ 'to be, to act as'; in unstressed position these
combinations contain the suffix in reduced form: /5-n, 5-x°, £-t, 5-ap/ (for the transcription without /a/ see 52). For instance, the 1st pers. sing, suffix /-(a)n/ is attached
to the full stem in /?i'tut-an/ 'my (hypothetical) sleeping' buttothecliticin/5-n w ?i l tut/
'I sleep'. These combinations of clitic + subject-suffix have to a certain extent
achieved the status of mere pronominal elements, cf. the 1st pers. plur. possessive
suffix /-Cat/ 'our' (see 127), where any reference to an action or process is absent.
The 1st pers. subject-suffixes /-an, -at/ are not combined with 2nd pers. objectsuffixes in the same word (for the expression of 'I ... thee', etc., the language has
recourse to clitics or to possessive affixes, see below). A number of forms referring
to a 3rd pers. subject lack the 3rd pers. subject-suffix /-as/ (for details see below);
the plural suffix /-uit/ appears in forms both with and without /-as/.
126. The following combinations of object- and subject-suffixes occur:
/-c-ax°,
-mS-ax0/
'thou ... me'
/-c-ajiap,
-ms-ajap/ 'you ... me'
/-c-as(-uit), -ms-as(-uit)/ 'he (they) ... me'
/-umu^-ax 0 /
'thou ... us'
/-umuX-ap/
'you ... us'
/-umuX,-as(-uit)/
'he (they) ... us'
The plural-suffix /-uit/ follows the subject-suffix: /-an-uit/ 'I ... them', /-ax°-yit/PERSONAL AFFIXATION87'you ... them', etc. Since the suffix /-uit/ can refer to subject as well as to object, the
combination /-as-uit/ can mean 'they... him', 'they... them' and (seldom) 'he ... them'.
127. Possessive Affixes.— In non-initial position, the 1st person sing, prefix /?n-/
usually loses its glottal stop. The 2nd pers. prefix /?3-/ is often reduced to zero in
the same position. Note that this prefix is written /?-/ before /m, n, 1/.
The 1st pers. plur. suffix /-Cat/ is etymologically (and phonetically) identical with
the combination of the clitic /5-/ and the 1st pers. plur. subject-suffix /-(a)t/ (see 125).
In the factual paradigm (see 133), which employs possessive as well as subjectaffixes to refer to the actor, the 1st pers. plural possessive suffix is /-5a't/ under a
secondary stress.
B. PARADIGMSThe Possessive Paradigm
128. The possessive paradigm consists simply of nouns provided with possessive
affixes. Here follows an example:
/?n-sn3x°i'A,/ 'my canoe'
/?3-snax°i 'X/ 'thy canoe'
/sn3x°i'X,-53t/ 'our canoe'
/?3-sn3x°i'X,-iap/ 'your canoe'
/sn3x°i'X,-s/ 'his canoe'
/sn9xci'X,-s-uit/ 'their canoe'
In the same way /Pnrla'm?/ 'my house', /?-la'm?/ 'thy house', etc. The 3rd pers. sing,
possessive form of nouns ending in /s/ is not distinct from the plain form, e.g.
/s?a'cus(-s)/ 'his face' (see 41).
The nouns with a prefix-combination /s-n-/ alternating with /n-/ or zero (see 176)
have the full prefix /s-n-/ when combined with a possessive prefix: /(s-)n-cq°u'?c-tn,
cq°u'?c-tn/ 'pipe', /?n-sncq°u'?ctn/ 'my pipe', /?3-sncq°u'?ctn/ 'thy pipe' (but
/(sn)cq°u'?ctn-s/ 'his pipe').
The Subject-Object Paradigms
129. Besides the possessive paradigm treated in the preceding section, four other
types of personal paradigms must be distinguished. These are labeled (1) Nominal,
(2) Finite, (3) Hypothetical and (4) Factual. These paradigms concern nouns (a) as
well as intransitive (b) and transitive (c) verbs. Given the noun 'man', the itr. verb
'come' and the tr. verb 'help', the meanings of (1-4) may be roughly described as
follows:
The nominal forms express the meanings (a) 'man', (b) 'one who comes', (c) 'one
who helps him, me, etc.', 'one whom he, I, etc. help(s)\88MORPHOLOGYThe finite forms express the meanings (a) 'he, etc., is a man', (b) 'he, etc., comes',
(c) 'he, etc., helps him, etc.'.
The hypothetical forms express the meanings (a) '(if) he, etc., is a man', (b) '(if) he,
etc., comes', (c) '(if) he, etc., helps him, etc.'.
The factual forms express the meanings (a) '(that) he, etc., is a man', (b) '(that) he,
etc., comes', (c) '(that) he, etc., helps him, etc.'.
Nominal forms can be preceded by nominal clitics (articles). Factual forms can be
preceded by the article /k°i/. Hypothetical forms can be preceded by the modal
clitic /qI 'if'. When paradigms are quoted, these clitics are omitted.
The nominal forms of verbs, and the 3rd pers. subject forms of the finite paradigm
of verbs are often preceded by the predicative clitic /na/ 'there, then'. When
paradigms are quoted, this clitic is included with these forms: it is the feature which
distinguishes nouns from verbs, cf. /sui'Pqa/ 'he is a man' vs. / n a ^ W q / 'he comes'.
The clitic /na/ may also be used in other than 3rd pers. subject forms of the finite
paradigm, but here its occurrence is rare.
The Nominal Paradigm
130. The nominal form of a noun and of an itr. verb consists of the stem without
subject- and object-suffixes; the only difference between the two consists of the use
of the clitic /na/, rare with nouns and common with verbs.
The nominal forms of a trans, verb constitute two series, one subject-centered
('who helps me, you, him, etc.'), the other object-centered ('whom I, you, he, etc.,
help(s)').
The subject-centered series consists of the verb-stem extended with object-suffixes
(NB 3rd pers. object zero).
The object-centered series consists of the verb-stem extended with subject-suffixes.
Examples: Noun: /s-ui'?qa/ 'man'. Itr. verb: /na w X, > i'q/ '(one) who arrives'.
Tr. verb:

he help(s)'
/na^C'a'u-at-as-uit/
they help'PERSONAL AFFIXATION89The Finite Paradigm
131. The 1st and 2nd pers. forms of the finite paradigm of nouns and intransitive verbs
consist of the clitic /£-/ provided with a subject-suffix plus the noun- or verb-stem.
The 3rd pers. forms lack a personal affix; they consist of the bare stem, in the case
of verbs usually preceded by the clitic /na/.
/5-n^sui'?qa/ 'I am a man'
/5-t w sui'?qa/ 'we are men'
/5-x°^_,sui'?qa/ 'thou art a man'
/5-ap, ,sui'?qa/ 'you are men'
/sui'PqaI
'he (it) is a man',
'they are men'/£-n w X/i l q/
'I come'
/C-t^Vi'q/
'we come'
/ 5 - x ° _ W q / 'thou comest'
/ f i - a p ^ W q / 'you come'
/na. ,Vi'q/
'he comes'
/na^X'i'q-uit/ 'they come'The clitic-combinations with /6-/ may also follow the stem: /sui '?qaw 5-n, X.'i 'q w 5-n/,
etc. The clitic /na/ always precedes.
Other clitics may be inserted between /5-n/, etc., /na/ and the stem, e.g.
/£-n_ua^,c > ic > a l p > / 'I am (was) working', / n a ^ u a ^ c ' i c ' a ' p ' / 'he is (was) working'.
The clitic /na/ may occur with 1st and 2nd pers. forms also, e.g. / n a w C - n ^ y a w
c'ic'a'p'/ 'I was working'; on the other hand, it may be absent in 3rd pers. forms,
e.g. /t'ix""^?/ 'it gets dry', /ck>0a'cut t a ^ k ' V t ' a n / 'the mouse runs'.
In the noun-paradigm the stem may be provided with possessive affixes, e.g.
/5-x°. .n-sja'j?/ 'you are my friend'.
In the verb-paradigm the stem may be an intransitivized transitive, i.e., a passive
verb, e.g. /5-n w 6'a l u-at-m/ 'I am helped', /£-x°^6 > a l u-at-m/ 'you are helped',
/na^C'a'u-at-m/ 'he is helped'. These forms are often found in contexts where
English would have an active verb with 3rd pers. actor ('he helps me, thee, him, etc.');
with a 2nd pers. object ('he helps thee, you') it is the only form used (see below).
The 1st and 2nd pers. subject forms of the transitive finite paradigm consist of
/£-/ + subject-suffix and stem with object-suffix (3rd pers. zero).
The 3rd pers. subject forms occur only with a 1st or 3rd pers. object (the former
referred to by a 1st pers. object suffix), and here the stem is provided with a 3rd pers.
subject suffix. For the expression of 'he, they help(s) thee, you' Squamish has
recourse to the passive forms /£-x°^5 ) a l u-at-m, S-ap^CVu-at-m/ 'thou, you are
helped'; these forms belong to the itr. paradigm /C-n^C'a'u-at-m/ 'I am helped',
see above.
On p. 90 a complete transitive paradigm is quoted. Where only passive forms are
used, these are given in braces. Note that the finite form /na^Ca'u-at-as/ 'he helps
him' is identical with the nominal form meaning 'one whom he helps' (and not with
'one who helps him'; see also 255). Corresponding forms with a subject-suffix
other than 3rd person can be used predicatively but they are very rare: my material
contains only /nawnq>a'A,»n3x°-at/ 'we /-at/ ran into it'.","[85, 86, 87, 88, 89]"

/saI with words marked by a 1 sing, possessive prefix: /sa w n*la'm?/ 'my house';
I cannot say whether for present, non-present or both.
Definite — Indefinite
190. The definite forms are used for objects which are individually identified for the
speaker in an independent way. The Squamish definite category therefore differs
from the English one in two ways. In the first place, in English the object must be
definite for the hearer also: one begins a report with 'I met a man ...' (the man is
identified for me but not yet for the hearer); in this case Squamish will use a definite
form. On the other hand, in English one uses the definite article in cases where the
object is defined for the speaker in a way which depends on the description exclusively:
'who is the man you met?' (the man is identified for me merely by the description
'(which) you met', but not independently — I could not point him out); in such cases
Squamish uses an indefinite form.",[137]
"XXVIII
SPECIAL TOPICSA. NEGATIVE /k°i/-CLAUSES313. In /k°i/-clauses derived from negative sentences, the predicate /hau/ is nominalized
by the prefix /s-/. Examples are available for the types of negative sentences discussed
in 301 (type Illb) and 302 (type IV).
314. In type Illb {301) the subordinate predicate is in the 3rd person and functions
as an impersonal verb (as the predicate /hau/ does when the negative clause is used
independently): /k°i w s-(h)a'u-s/ 'its not being the case', 'that it is not the case':
/?9sk>0a'i k°i w s-ha l u-s q w u w ? a s w n a ' m ? / 'he must go', lit. 'impossible is its not
beingthecase that he is going', /?3sk>0a'i k°i_.n-s-(h)a'u q ^ u ^ P a n ^ n a ' m ? / 'Imust
go', /Xq'i'Ps^S-n k°i^s-ha , u-s q ^ u ^ P a s ^ n a ' m ? / 'I know that he won't go'.
315. In type IV (302) the subordinate predicate /s-hau/ is provided with possessive
affixes referring to the subject: /X.q'i'Ps^C-x0 k°i w n-s-ha'u qa w X. w na l m?-ai?m/
'you know that I don't want /-ai?m/ to go', /Xq'i'Pst-as-uit k°i w s-ha'u-53t
na'mPaiPm/ 'they know that we don't want to go'; in the same way /k 0 i w s-ha'u-s .../
'that he doesn't ...', /k°i w (?3-)s-ha l u-iap .../ 'that you pi. don't ...'.
316. As to the types of which no examples of this kind were recorded, these may be
conjectured with reasonable confidence: I ¡290) f/k°i w ,s-ha l u-s q^n-sk c ci'?c-as/
'that he is no relative of mine', t/k°i w s-ha'u-s q^tina'P-an/ 'that I am not from

t/k°i w s-ha'u-q-s ji'PuX./ 'that there is no firewood'.
B. FACTUAL FORMS WITHOUT /k°i/317. After predicates referring to location, /k°i/-clauses have alternatives without /k°i/
and without possessive affixes in the subordinate nominalized expression, e.g.
/na w ?3'n5a s-nav_^k>°al5.n3x°-ax0/ 'where did you see him?' (besides /...k°i w (?a-)sna_•••/), /ti-Pa'nCa s-na^p'i'Pnax^ax 0 / '(from) where did you get it?', /ti-Pg'nia200SYNTAXs-p>il?n3x°-as/ 'where did he get it?' (besides /ti-Pa'nfia k°i w s-ni-s_p > i l ?n3x°-as/
'where did he get it?'), /na_,ua^?a'is ta w la'm? s-ua^c'ic'a'p'/ 'he is working inside
the house'(besides/... k^^s-ni-s^ua^c'ic'a'p'/),/na 1 ? X'a^Pa'lqsn s-ua^c'ic'a'p'/
'he is working at Pt. Grey', /na^,ua w ?s l n5a s-ua^c'icVp'/ 'where is he working?'.
Notice that with the intransitive verb /c'icVp'/, which is without subject-suffix, the
main predicate is of necessity personal in these cases: /na^ua^Pa'nCa s-ua^c'ic'a'p'/
can be translated literally 'where is he, working?' (versus the impersonal predicate in
/na^Pa'nSa s-na w k >0 a5.n9x 0 -ax°/ 'where was it (that) you saw him?').
318. Otherwise than in /k°i/-clauses, factual forms are used in the first place as
predicates of sentences which carry an account a step further (English '(and) then...').
In these cases the verb is preceded by the clitic /mn/. For examples see 342Jf. In
the second place, factual forms are used after /mn^ia'X/ 'just (recently)', 'for the
first time'; for examples see 346.
C. ZERO-CLAUSES319. Forms of the hypothetical paradigm (732) may occur as clauses without introductory clitic. As regards their meaning, these zero-clauses are very close to
/q/-clauses, for which in several cases they can occur as alternatives (see 320; cf. also
289, where in the type without /Pu/ an initial zero-clause is coordinated with a
following /q/-clause).
320. Zero-clauses are used in the first place in 'if' or 'when' sentences, in non-initial
position in some cases as alternatives of /q/-clauses (cf. 287, 288). In some of the
examples which follow, the clitic /q/ may have escaped notice after the future clitic
/PaqV in the main predicate. — /Pa-s^'i 'P-as/ 'if you want', lit. 'if it is your desire',
/siXa?a'n^5-x° ha'PX-as/ 'buy it if it's good', /^'i'q-as^Paq' Ca'sn^Ca'n^Paq'/
'when he comes, I'll send him', /cu't^C-n^Paq' ci l x°-an( w Paq > )/ 'I'll say it when I
get there', /c'icVp'^Paq* ci'x°-as k ^ x V i Xqa'j5'/ 'he'll work next month', lit.
'when it gets there, the coming month', /kVj^as/, usually pronounced /k°a'il3s/,
'tomorrow', lit. 'when it becomes day'.
321. In the second place, zero-clauses are used as subordinate clauses after verba
declarandi: /na_,ua w cu'ntcas ?i^m?i l 2 an/ 'he was telling me to come here',
/5-n w ?u't mil2as Pu'js/ 'I called him in', /<5-n^ua_cu l ntumi ?i w mn^?i l 2 ax°/ 'I was
telling you to stay here', /ua w ia'n?tcas-uit ¿u'2an/ 'they were warning me to be
careful',/ua^Ja'ntcasuit ha'PX-as q_ju , 2 an/or /...ha'PX-as k 0 i^,n-s-ua w iu'h/'they
warned me that it would be good if I were careful', /na w ui l lq >0 tcasuit sua't-as ta'i?/
'they asked me who that was'.
322. In addition, zero-clauses were recorded in the following cases, each of which
represents a type of which I can give no other examples: /x°u?alx° Pi'Xn^'s-uit/ 'theySPECIAL TOPICS201haven't eaten yet' (see 300, note); /k c 3k 0 i'n?^Xk°un ?3s.li'l?x°-as/ 'it could have been
lying (there) a long time'; /ju'h^C-a'x 0 , k^a'C.nm-ax0/ or /... tk°a'jaPn.mintm-ax0/
'be careful, they might see (or: hear) you!'; /sta'm k°i^_,?3-sVi>? Xa'lPt-ax0/ 'what do
you want to write?'; once as a /q/-less counterpart of a /q/-clause of type III (295):
/Pas w ua^si'siq-uit/ 'when they are flying' (1:31); once as a /X/-less counterpart of
a /^/-clause of type I (505): /k°3k 0 i'n?_?u Pax 0 _?i'/ 'have you been here long?'.
D. NOMINAL VERB-FORMS323. Verb-forms of the nominal paradigm (130) are used in exactly the same way as
nouns; for examples of use as independent nominal expressions see 258, as attributive
adjuncts see 259, as appositive adjuncts see 260. Here follow additional examples of
use as subject or object: /£a'int-as k°9A,i^na w na'nam?/ 'he chased her who was
traveling' (111:15), /s-s w mn w t3?a'u?n-uit qi'-as k 0 3ci w na w ta'q°ant-as-uit/ 'then
they supposed that that which they had drunk was bad' (IV: 31), / t a _ u a ^ X , - s ^
na'nam? k^Xi^na^ua^CiSa'jPst-as/ 'where she was traveling, the one he was
pursuing' (111:16). The forms under discussion are particularly common as subjects
with predicates containing substitutes or numerical expressions: /sta'm k 0 i^_na w
k>°al5.n9x°-ax°/ 'what did you see?', /sta'm t a ^ n a ^ u a ^ P i ' p ' i s t - a s / 'what has he
got there?', lit. 'what is that which he is holding?', /sta'm k°i^_sa'tsit-as/ 'what will
he give him?', /k'°in k°i^na, w ,p > i l ?n3x°-ax7 'how many did you catch?', /k'°in
k°iw n a ^ u a ^ t a 'Pst-ax0/ 'how many are you making?', /qs'X k°a_,na w ma '¿.n3x°-an/
'I've forgotten much', /k>0i'n k°i^ta'Pst-ax 0 / 'just make a few', /k^i'minut k ° i ^ ? i _
XJi'qst-ax°/ 'how many pieces (items) did you bring here?', /XaPu'cnrmut
k°i^Xi't > it-ax 0 / 'divide it into four', /k > °i'n w Paq > k ^ t a 'Pst-ax0/ or /k'°in k ° i _
ta'?st-ax c w PaqV 'you'll make a few', /sua't k°i w/ ua s _ / na'nt-m t-k°i_,Pi'ta/ 'who is
the one called Peter?',/sua't X'a^na'u-jap k ° i _ n a w t a ' ? s ti 1 /'which one of you made
this?'. A nominal trans, verb-form referring to the subject (as in the last example)
and with an object-suffix: /sua't k°i^na^_q°3ha [ ia?ni [ ?nt-umi/ 'who (is the one that)
pierced your ears?'. — Here also belong the heads of expressions with predicative
independent adjuncts (see 265), e.g. /k°3ci w cu'nt-as-uit sk°ca'Ps/ 'that which they
thought to be an island' (IV:6; cf. also the other examples given in 265).
Examples of use without article (see 268): /Pa'ns n a w t a ' ? s / 'it's me who made it',
/ni'A, ta'j? na^q°3ha'ia?ni?n/ 'it is he there who pierced her ears', /mani'X,
?aA,iv_^nawua,w5i£a'i?st-as n a ^ c u ' n / 'it was she, the one he was persuing, herself,
who told him' (111:26), /Pi'ta na^k'a'£.n3x°-as t a w T a ' m / 'it is Peter who saw
Tom', /tx°(h)u'i na^Pi'p'ist-an/ 'it's all I've left'.
Notice that in the case of predicative independent adjuncts (265), e.g. / t i w n a w
ua^cu'ntm na w ua w Aa?4i'?uty 'this one they thought (lit. 'who was thought) to be
eating fire' (IV: 11) the adjunct consists of a form of the finite and not of the nominal
paradigm (the two are formally identical): the form refers to a fact (that he was
eating fire) and not to an object (one who is eating fire). A noun in the same position202SYNTAXplays the role of a subordinate nominal predicate: /ti^cu'ntas sk°ca'?s/ 'this which
he thought to be an island' (IV: 2); the man did not dream up an object (island) but
thought a fact (its being an island). When the quotational expression itself is used
predicatively, alternative constructions with adjuncts and with /k°i/-clauses are
possible: /?n-sq°a'luan na_,k° w tu l int-as-uit ta w la'm?-s-uit/ or /...
tu'jntasuit .../ 'I think that they've already left their house'. With nominal forms of
quotational verbs alternatives with /k°i/-clauses were not recorded, and they probably
would sound as unelegant in Squamish as ""the one who was thought that he was
eating fire"" sounds in English.","[198, 199, 200, 201, 202]"
"PHONETIC DATA3324. In the case of /m?, n?/ the preferred variants finally or before cons, have the
glottal closure near the beginning: /lam?/ [la -m ?] 'house', /Xim?/ [Xe""m?] 'be accepted',
/hin?/ [he-n?] 'be a long time', /sum?/ [so""mP] 'smell; itr.% /man?/ [ m A n ? ] 'child,
offspring'. The same variants before cons.: /lam?s/ [la -m ?s] 'his house', /sq°in?c/
[sq°ein?c] 'beard', /k°um?5/ [k°o' m ?£] 'go over a hill', /st'amPq 0 / [st'Am?q°] 'scalped'.
25. In final /-IP/ the liquid is clearly audible and I write [1?]: /q'al?/ [qVl?] 'consent',
/X°il?/ [X°E'l?] 'come out, come off' (note the difference from the type / si 'PI/ [se'Pal]),
/ial?/ [XslP] 'write; itr.'. Except in /-ilP-/ the preconsonantal variant is the same:
/?al?s/ [Pa'IPs] 'to pity' /XalPt/ [XslPt] 'write; tr.', though sometimes an ""l""-resonance
is heard after [?] so that the impression is almost [?a-l?Js, Xae'PJt]. The sequence /il?C/
is always pronounced [e'PelC], e.g. /X°il?t/ [X°E'?elt] 'take out, take off' (a transitive
derivation of /X°il?/ quoted above), ji°V\?mj [XVPElip] 'rope'. This sequence is
common in reduplicative formations characterized by glottalization: /Pas.li 'l?x°/
[?3slei?Elx°] 'lying down' (cf. / l i x ° / [k'x°] 'fall down'), /lil?s/ [lei?els] 'be under,
below' (cf. /las/ [Lvs] 'bottom'), /sX-Wi'lPqm/ [sA.'eX.'s'Pelqip] 'bug' (a diminutive
reduplication of /sX'a'lqm/ 'monster').
26. Final /-j?/ and /-u?/ are not parallel phonetically. In /-i?/ the resonant is usually
interrupted near the beginning, and a brief ['] is heard after the release of the glottal
stop: /tai?/ [ta-i?1, ta*?1] 'that one', /slai?/ [sla-i?1, sla""?1] 'fir bark'. In /-u?/, on the
other hand, the glottal stop usually falls quite at the end of the resonant: /§au?/
[sa'u?] 'bone' Aau?/ [Xa-uP] 'recover; itr.', /c'iu?/ [c'e-u?]'heal, close'(ab. wound);
itr.', /sXau?/ [sXau?] 'salmon backbone'. Both types of variants are possible in both
cases, however. Before cons, both resonants have a brief reflex after [P]: /?ai?X/
[Pat»)?1*] 'crab', /hui?s/ [ h o - ^ s ] 'eat;tr.\ /XauPs/ [Xa-(U)?us] 'new', /?au?t/ [?a""(V)?»t
'future'. Before a group of two consonants /-ay?-/ is usually pronounced [a?o],
i.e. the postglottal reflex has become dominant: /sau?cq/ [§a'?ocq] 'bony-faced'
(cf. /Say?/ quoted above), /stau?x°A,/ [sta'?ox°X,] 'children'.
27. Final /-h?/ occurs only in /tah?/ [ta? a ] 'undergo; be located' (a homophonous
root means 'mother' (address), cf. also /hata'h?/ [hata'? a ] 'aunty'), further in /Xah?/
[Xa?a] 'be touched'. In medial position /ah?/ is not distinguished from /a?/.
28. Medially before a vowel or syllabic /m, n, 1/ variants with glottal closure near
the beginning of the sonant are usual in all cases: /na'm?n/ [na"" lm ?m$] 'go and get
someone; tr.' (a derivative of /nam?/ [na' m P] 'go'), /nSa'uPus/ [n5a-|w?uos] 'skinny'
(a derivative of /§au?/ [Sa'u?] 'bone'), /si'uPaC/ [se-l»?uae£] 'foreleg', /t^a'jPus/
[t'*a -| i?ios] 'lightning'. Deviations from this norm in one direction may create a
trisyllabic impression [na'Pipy], while in the other direction the sonant may be
articulated as a whole before the glottalization, e.g. [t>X°a* 'i?os]. However, in these
cases the pronunciation of /R?V/ overlaps that of sequences which are phonemically34PHONOLOGYdistinct from it, namely on the one hand that of /?RV/ as in /na'Pnat/ [na'Pgast]
'evening', /li'Plam/ [le'PJam] 'little house', /§a'?iu/ [Sa'P^o] 'corpse', and on the other
hand that of /R/ + /?V/, written /R.?V/ as in /tl.?a 'c.na5/ [tJpAcniei] 'east wind' (see 40).
29. In a few words sequences [-i?u-, -u?i-, -j?i-] were recorded, and since these cannot
be opposed to any other type of glottalized sequence of two sonants [i, u], it is in
itself immaterial whether one transcribes /-i?u-/, etc., or /-¿u?-/, etc. The former
alternative is clearly indicated by those cases of [-i?i-, -y?i-] which involve stems
ending in /-¿?, -u?/ followed by the 2nd pers. plur. possessive suffix /-iap/, e.g.
/sia'i?/ 'friend', /Pa-sia'iP-jap/ 'your pi. friend', and I choose this alternative in all
cases, e.g. /ja'iPuas/ 'bed platform', /sua'i?ui/ (geogr. name). — It is probable that a
number of cases recorded [-e»?u], transcribed /-iu?-/, go back to */-ai?u-/ (e.g. in the
suffixes /-iy?iX, -iy?as/). See also 70.
30. Note.— LM claimed on one occasion that there is a difference in pronunciation
between the final part of /lam?/ 'house', /sum?/ 'smell' on the one hand, and that of
/ham?/ 'be covered', /pum?/ 'swell' on the other hand, pronouncing the former with
[ m ?] and the latter with [m?]. IJ pronounced [ha -m ?, po , m ?] however, and for LM
the medial pronunciation in /ha'm?n/ 'cover; tr.' was the same as that of other medial
cases of /-m?-/. When a number of cases were checked, LM pronounced [m?] (rather
than [ m ?]) only in /sx°im?/ 'discarded object'. Having mentioned the pertinent cases,
I further disregard this distinction, which in any case is not made by all speakers.
F. VOWEL AND DIPHTHONG H31. The distinction between /ai?, au?, ah?/ and /i?, u?, a?/ — like that between their
non-glottalic counterparts (see 14-19) — has a low functional yield, and here, too,
there often is an etymological equivalence between the two series. It is again the
cases with /i, i/ where the distinction is weakest, in this case to the extent of being
non-existent: /ai?/ and /i?/ are either in free variation or in complementary distribution,
and only /i?/ is written (see 21; the variants [e?1, ej?, oj?] may be considered to represent /ai?/, the variants [e?, E?] representing /i?/).
32. /au?/ and /u?/ are in several cases kept apart, cf. /na'u?n/ [no'W?uij] 'put in; tr.'
vs. /c'u'Pn/ [c'o'?9] 'pull out; tr.', /mu'?n/ [mo 1 ??] 'drop; tr.'; however, the root of
the first example appears with /u?/ in /tx°.nu?/ [tx°no'?] '(land) into'. Stressed final
/au?/ was recorded in /?asia'u?/ [PasiS'u?] 'seer' and /sXau?/ [sXay?] 'salmon backbone', stressed final /u?/ in /c'u?/ [c'o?] 'come out (being pulled)' and /tx°.nu?/
(see above). In unstressed syllables /ay?/ is found before vowels and syllabic sonants,
/u?/ elsewhere. In a few cases the two are in free variation: /Pasq'aq'a'y?, Pasq'aq^u1?/
'(be) together with', /x 0 au?a'x°, x 0 u?a'x7 'not yet'.
33. /ah?/ and /a?/ are distinguished in stressed word-final position only, cf. /tah?,PHONETIC DATA35(ha)t3'h?, A,ah?/ quoted in 27, pronounced with [a'? a ] as opposed to [a1?] in /na?/
'be on, at', /tx°ta1?/ '(land) onto'.
34. It is worthy of note that /na?, tx°ta?/ and also /tx°.nu?, Pasq'aq'V?/ quoted in 32
belong to the category of so-called ""relator-verbs"" (corresponding to English prepositions, see 219, 220). This category has /A?/ (A = full vowel) in two cases where
related ""plain"" lexical items have the shape /aR?/, namely in /tx°.nu?, tx°ta?/ vs.
/na'u?n, tah?/, and if /Pasq'aq'V?/ has /Pasq'aqVu?/ besides it, this is because the
plain uvular apparently resists the reduction of a following /au?/ to /u?/, before which
it becomes automatically labialized (5). The tendency of relator-verbs to reduce
/aR?/ to /A?/ may be due to a less prominent stress of such words in the sentence as a
whole. However, a few ""plain"" lexical items were recorded with stressed final /A?/:
/¿a?/ 'be tight', /c'u?/ 'come out', cf. also—with two stresses—/sma l q >0 a l ?/[sipo l q >0 a 1 ?]
'crane'.
G. UNSTRESSED VOWELS35. In the unstressed part of a word the consonants do not differ from those in stressed
syllables. Of the full vowels, /i/ and /u/ in preaccentual position allow a closer
pronunciation than under the stress (extreme variants [i] and [u]), e.g. /hiPa'm?/
[he?a ,|m ?, hi?a ,|m ?] 'come home', /tuta'u?/ [tota-'u?, tuta-'u?] 'bright'. Unstressed
/a/ has the variants [a, ae, e, o] depending on the consonantal environment in terms
of neutral [ae], palatal [e] and labialized [o] consonants, the timbre [a] being heard
most often before glides and /I/, in the neighborhood of /?/ and, to a lesser extent, of
plain uvulars, and also at the end of a word. Unstressed /a/, and also the facultative
vowel is unstressed /Cm, Cn, CI/ (see 8) is a schwa-type vowel [a], strongly colored by
neighboring palatals [i] and uvulars [a, se], by preceding labialized consonants,
velar [u] or uvular [u, o] and by following labialized consonants, velar [ii] and uvular
[ii, o]. As these timbres show, uvulars tend to open /a/, resulting in a pronunciation
which largely coincides with that of /a/ (see 38).
36. Vowel-Reduction.— A striking feature in the pronunciation of longer words is
the strong tendency to reduce unstressed vowels to [a] and its variants, or even to
zero. Here follow some examples (optimal and reduced forms are given in this
order): /sta'uaqin/ [sto'yaqeyi, sto'yaeqen, sto'uaqan, -qg] 'graveyard', /ma'lalus/
[mA'lalos, mA'lalas] 'raccoon', /?u'x 0 umix°/ [?o-'x°omex°, ?o -l x°umux 0 ] 'village'; a
particular type of reduction in /aft?)/, e.g. /X'VX'iX""^ [Ve- 'X»e*°ai, X l e ,| reX 0 ei, -X°e]
'brook trout', /sli1 *°ai?§n/ [sis''i c ai?§ij, sic'Xcoi?sn] 'foot of mountain', where /aj(?)/
tends to merge with /i(?)/. In the neighborhood of uvulars, reduced vowels tend to
be more open, and particularly /i/ is often reduced to [e] in this position (cf. /sta'yaqin/
quoted above); the same goes for /i(?)/ as a reduction of /aj(?)/, e.g. /si'uai?q/
[se- 'yai?q, se- 'ye?q] 'pants'. The unstressed suffixes /-yiX, -yas/ reduce to /-vik, -us/,36PHONOLOGYe.g. /5a'?tuity [5a'?tuek, -uiX, - o l ] 'build a canoe', /nq>0i 'q>0lxjas/ [naq'V 'q>0Juaes, -os]
'stick for holding salmon above the fire'.
This tendency to reduce unstressed vowels has had phonemic consequences: many
words contain affixes in reduced form even in the most careful pronunciation, so that
alternative forms of the affix must be recognized: /-qin, -qn/, /-mix°, -max0/, ¡-uik, -vX/,
etc. As an example may serve the suffix /-qin, -qn/ 'head; hair; throat; language'
which occurs stressed in /ns-qi'n-m/ [nsqe'jnip] 'rub oil /ns-/ in one's hair', and
unstressed in reduced form in /s-na's-qn/ [snA'sqjj] 'hair-oil', in non-reduced form in
/6>ix°-i'-qin/ [S>ex°e' 'qeyi] 'be thirsty', lit. 'have a dry /C'ix0-/ throat' (of course, the
latter word allows also reduced forms with [-qen,
in the same way as the example
/sta'uaqin/ quoted above, but /sna'sqn/ does not allow a form with [-qejn] — it is
as if, in English, both ""forehead"" and ""bulkhead"" had a form with [-id], which only
in the latter case allowed a fuller pronunciation with [-hed]).
37. Progressive vowel-assimilation.— The vowel in a stressed syllable exerts an
assimilating influence on the vowel(s) following it. For instance, after a stressed /a1/
an /a/ in the next syllable is often pronounced [a] rather than [ae], e.g. /t'a't'aX/
[t'a - 't'aeA,, t V t ' a X ] 'loom' versus /mi'Xa[me^'XaeX] 'black bear'. This tendency to
progressive vowel assimilation has had phonemic consequences: certain suffixes often
occur with the same vowel as is found in the stem to which they are added, e.g. the
transitivizer /-(V)n/, cf. /ma's-n/ 'put, stick together; tr.', /c'a'q'-an/ 'hit; tr.', /mu'j-un/
'soak; tr.', /Xi 'k>0-in/ 'hook, hang up; tr.' (see sections 86,92,107). (This is a tendency
and not a strict rule, cf. /na'm?-n/ 'go and get someone; tr.). For a case of progressive
vowel-assimilation involving clitics see 55.
38. Phonemic transcription of unstressed vowels.— The possible reduction of all unstressed vowels to schwa and the possible opening of schwa-type vowels to [ae, o],
etc., in the neighborhood of uvulars, combined with the fact that reduced forms in
many cases have become standardized, causes certain difficulties with regard to the
phonemic interpretation of individual recordings. The following principles have been
adhered to:
(a) Close vowels [a, I, u, ii] in their regular positions, of which no open alternative
[ae, e, o, o] was recorded in the same word or grammatical (not lexical!) affix, are
transcribed /a/ (resp. zero before /m, n, 1/, see 8).
(b) Open vowels [a, ae, e, o, o] in their regular positions are transcribed /a/, except
that /a/ is written in the neighborhood of uvulars in those cases where in an identical
morphological formation /a/ rather than /a/ is found in non-uvular surroundings.
For instance, the first vowel in [staeqtaqe '¿u] 'horses' is transcribed with /a/: /staqtaqi 'u/
(morphologically /s-taq-taqi'u/) because the reduplicated plural has close vowels,
i.e. /a/, in neutral surroundings, cf. /s-mnTma'nit/ [smanma - 'net] 'mountains'.
(c) In cases where full and reduced forms were recorded and where the reduced
form is very much more common than the full one, or where it was used in deliberatelyPHONETIC DATA37careful pronunciation, alternative forms are recognized (thus in the case of /nqJ0i 'q>0lus/
quoted in 36, which is much more common than the form with /-uas/).
As far as unstressed vowels are concerned, the possibility of errors in individual
cases must especially be taken into account in the case of the following pairs: the
variant [u] of /s/ and the variant [u] of /u/; the variant [i] of /a/ and the variant
[i] of /i/; the variant [ae] of /a/ and the variant [E] of /i/; in addition, certain cases
with /a/ may allow full forms which were not recorded (see 97, 111). The account of
unstressed vowels given here is certainly incomplete: a special investigation would
probably reveal a complex system of neutralizations. For instance, in postaccentual
position before /%, X'/ only open vowels were recorded, and according to (b) above
I write /a/, e.g., in /mi'Xaty [me-'XasX,] 'black bear', /sta'jak/ [sta-'jeX] 'brother's or
sister's child', though a transcription with /a/ would be just as unambiguous here.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]"

SPECIAL QUESTIONSA. JUNCTURE39. The distinction between syllabic and non-syllabic juncture between a cons, and
a following /m, n, 1/ (see 8) is made more or less consistently only between syllables,
i.e. in the case /CVC.RVC/ versus /CVCRVC/ (where VC may be replaced by syllabic
/m, n, 1/, as in the examples /st'l.mu'Pt, t'lma'i?/ quoted in 8), and here /./ is written.
In word-initial position there is perhaps a tendency to non-syllabic contact in combinations of the nominalizing prefix /s-/ and stems /RVC.../ when R is represented
by /I/, or when the syllable is unstressed. For instance, one normally pronounces
[sipa-1-, s^a-1-] in /s-ma'nit/ 'mountain', /s-nat/ 'night'; on the other hand I recorded
[sla-1-] rather than [sja-'-] in /slaut'/ 'herring', and [sman-, smQ-] rather than [sipan-,
sipp-] in /s-mnTma'nit/ 'mountains'. But this pattern is not rigidly adhered to;
I recorded [sgox0-] in /s-n3xci'X/ 'canoe' (reduplicated plural /s-n3x0»nax°i'X/). A distinction between /CiV1-, CuY1-/ and /QV 1 -, CuV1-/ is not made at all, and I use the
latter transcription only where C is represented by/s-/, e.g. in /si»'cm/ [siie'cip] 'news',
cf. /ia'cm/ [ie'crp] 'tell, report' (an initial /s-/ so frequently represents the nominalizing
prefix (80) that in all units /sC.../ where there is no morphological evidence to the
contrary it may be regarded as such).
When a vocalic prefix precedes a nominalized unit /s-RVC.../ the tendency to
non-syllabic contact when R is represented by /m, n, 1/ is somewhat stronger, and
here /./ is written, e.g. /ti-STmaq'rma'q'-m/ [tesmAq'-] 'overeat'.
A distinction of juncture-types is also problematic in sequences /-V?R-/: in
/p'i'Pnax0/ 'have seized' one hears syllabic variants o f / n / much more often than in
the morphologically parallel case /k'VC.nax 0 / 'see', lit. 'have caught sight o f ' (cf.
also, for an extreme case, the last variant of /q^u'PnauPa'sn/ quoted in 20, end).
40. In a number of words medial sequences o f / R / and /?/ were recorded which differ
from those treated in 28 in that the glottal stop clearly falls after the complete
articulation of the sonant. In some cases these may be accidental variants, e.g. in
/hiuPi'qn/, recorded [heuPe-'qp] 'those sitting in front', where the root itself isSPECIAL QUESTIONS39facultatively glottalized (/hiu(?)/ 'be upstream'). In others there is a morphemeborder between /R/ and /?/, and the second morpheme is found independently with
/?/; in these cases I write /R.?/ or, where morphemes are separated, /R»?/, e.g.
/?mr?i 'mac/ 'grandchildren' (reduplicated plural of /Pi'mac/),/tUPa'cTnaC/ [tJpA'cneC]
'east wind' (cf. /Pa'crnaC/ 'territory of Indian Reserve no. 3'). Such cases were sometimes also recorded where junctural glottalization (69, 70) is involved, but in most
examples of this category one hears the usual variants of /R?/, so that at most the
existence of a tendency can be registered; I do not mark these cases with /./.
B. CONSONANTS41. In several cases a sequence of two identical consonants regularly merges into a
single one. For instance, the 3rd. pers. possessive suffix /-s/ is inaudible after stems
ending in /s/: the form [taesPa- 'cos] means 'the face' as well as 'his face', and in the
latter case I transcribe /ta w s?a'cus(-s)/, on the analogy of /ta^la'mP-s/ 'his house',
etc. In other cases such a merger is frequent, but a pronunciation as geminates is
possible. For instance, the relative-case prefix /t-/ often merges with a following
article or demonstrative beginning with /t/, e.g. in /timPa1 t-ta'j?/ 'like that' one
hears sometimes [tta*1?1] with two separate explosions, but also [ta-1?1]; in the latter
case I write /(t-)ta'i?/ in recorded sentences.
42. After /n(P), 1(P)/ a distinction of /c/ and /s/ is problematic. I have recorded
/Pans/ 'I', though comparative evidence (Cw. a'nGa) points to /c/, and /xcilPq°l?s/
'steamboat', though a final /-c/ would allow a likely etymology 'fiery-mouthed' (see
Dictionary), and so in other cases. A similar problem exists with regard to the
distinction of non-initial /c/, /ts/ and /tc/. I have recorded /p'i'Ptcka/ [p'e- 'Pt'cke]
'grab me!', with a slightly affricated variant of /t/ followed by a full affricate
(morphologically the word consists of the root /p'i?-/, the transitivizer /-t/, the 1 sg.
object-suff. /-c/ and the imperative suff./-ka/). In /p'i'Ptcax0/ 'your /-ax°/ grabbing
me /-c-/' the same sequence /-t-c-/ is morphophonemically present, but I doubt if
before a vowel /tc/ is distinct from /c/. Words containing the reflexive suffix /-sut/
or /-cut/ were always recorded with [cot], and here the pronunciation was checked
carefully: it is identical with that of /cut/ [co't] 'to say' where initial /c-/ is distinct
from /ts-/ (see 5). But since trans, verb-stems which take this reflexive suffix have a
final /-t-/ before all other personal suffixes (also before passivizing /-m/, see 82), and
particularly since the reflexive form of verbs with the transitivizers /-at, -ut, -it/ has
/-acut, -ucut, -icut/, these forms end morphophonemically in /-(V)t-cut/ or /-(V)t-sut/.
There is nothing in Squamish itself that points to the former alternative, and for
analytical purposes I write /-(V)t-sut/, for practical purposes (texts) /-(V)cut/.
43. A morpheme-initial /h/ is dropped after a consonantal prefix, e.g. /hiy/ [he-u] 'be
upstream', /s-(h)iu/ [se'u] 'upstream region', /tx°-(h)iu/ [tx°e-y] 'move upstream';
/hii1/ [hiie-1] 'big', /nax0-(h)iiLqs/ [nux°iie- >qs] 'big-nosed' (suff. /-qs/ 'nose').","[37, 38, 39]"
"XIV
CASE-PREFIX188. Nominal expressions can appear in two case-forms, Absolutive and Relative.
The Absolutive case receives no indication. The Relative case is marked by a
prefix ¡t-/. This prefix is added either to the article which precedes a nominal form,
or to a demonstrative substitute. Thus, to the absolutive (zero-) forms of the articles
/ta, k°a/, etc. (see 189), there are opposed the relative forms /t-ta, t-k°a/, etc., and to
the absolutive demonstratives /taj?/ 'that one', /?i'ci 2 uit/ 'those, they', etc. (see 202),
the relative forms /t-ta 'i?, t-?i'ci 2 uit/, etc.
The relative prefix /t-/ easily merges with the initial /t/ of a deictic element (see 41),
in which case the relative form becomes indistinguishable from the absolutive. Only
with proper names and personal pronouns the articles /ta, \aj have a special relative
form A'a/, e.g. /na 1 ? X'a^Pa'lqsn/ 'on, at /na?/ Point Grey' vs. /na 1 ? t - t a w
sma'nit/ 'on the mountain', /ma'Cn X'a^Qa'lqalik/ 'QalqaliX's lice'.
The Absolutive is the case of the subject, and also of the direct object of a transitive
verb; other relata appear in the Relative case (see 244-248).","[135, 136]"
"XXV
/k°i/ CLAUSES275. A subordinate member of a sentence may itself be an independent predicative
expression, i.e. one where neither subject nor object, nor any other relatum has
necessarily the same referent as the main predicate, but where the fact itself is a
referent of the main predicate (as in ""I know (the fact) that A helps B"" versus "" I
know (him) who helps B"" or ""... whom A helps""). In Squamish such expressions are
rendered by forms of the factual paradigm (133) preceded by the article /k°i/, and
they are referred to as /k°i/-clauses. The fact expressed by such a clause may play the
role of subject to the main predicate (""That A helps B pleases me""), or that of object
(""I know that A helps B"") or that of some other relatum (""I am surprised that A
helps B""), and in the latter case even a literal English translation often has to have
recourse to expressions other than the conjunction ""that"", such as ""while"", ""when"",
""as regards"", ""in the matter of"", ""in order to"", etc. On the other hand, all /k°i/clauses have in common that no single referent of the clause can play the role of
subject or object of the main predicate. Where S or O of the English subordinate
clause play this role (cf. the 2nd and 3rd examples above, and also ""(He) who helps B
is my friend"", ""(He) whom A helps wins the game"") Squamish has recourse to forms
of the nominal paradigm (130). Where some other aspect of the English subordinate
clause plays the role of S or O (as in "" I know (the reason) why, (the time) when,
(the way) how, (the one) with whom A helps B"", or in ""The reason why A helps B
surprises me"", etc.) Squamish has recourse to /^/-clauses (304-312). There remain,
then, all those clauses which — elegantly or not — can be turned into expressions
with ""the fact that"" (""while"" = ""during the fact that"") or with a construction
""A's helping B"" (""while A helped B"" = ""during A's helping B""); these constitute the
domain of /k°i/-clauses. Note that the /k°i/-clause does not express explicitly the
temporal notion ""during"" in these examples: the choice between the interpretations
""that"", ""while"", ""in order to"", etc., depends on the context.
At first glance, certain /k°i/-clauses might be taken for nominal expressions taking
the position of S or O. For instance, in /hi'nP^Pit' k°i^n-STna'?/ 'I'll be away (lit.
""there"") for a long time' the phrase /k'i^n-Srna 1 ?/ could be translated 'my being
there' and regarded as the subject of /hi'nP^PitV 'it will be long'; and in184SYNTAX/C-n^ma'i.nax 0 k^^n-STmi'st-an/ 'I have forgotten to bring it' the phrase
/k°iwn-STinilst-an/ (/mi-s/ 'bring', lit. 'cause to come; tr.') could be translated 'my
bringing it' and regarded as the object of /S-n^ma'j.nax 0 / 'I have forgotten it; tr.'.
But in /iia'i-ka k^iPsOs-S'i'nt-ax 0 / 'lift it a little bit', lit. 'act sligtly in the matter
of your lifting it', the phrase /k°i s _s5'i l ntax7 cannot be interpreted as the object of
/6ia '¿-ka/, the latter being intransitive, nor can it be taken as the subject, for /Siaj-ka/
is addressed to a 2nd person and can be replaced by /5ia'i^,<5ax0/ (see 239). Notice,
furthermore, that /k°i^,s5>ilntax°/ cannot be described as a nominal secondary
relatum (270), since in this case it would have to be in the relative case, with /t-k°i/
rather than /k°i/. Therefore, these subordinate expressions constitute a category
sui generis. Interestingly, closely parallel sentences may differ precisely with regard
to the possibility of interpreting a /k°i/-clause as a subject, e.g., 'I cannot see it' can
be expressed /?3sk>0a'i k°iwn-s-k>°al£.nax°-an/ 'impossible is my seeing it' or
alternatively /6-n w ,?3sk'°a l i k°iwn-s-k>0al6.n9x°-an/, lit. 'I am impotent in the matter
of my seeing it'; in the former case (objective impossibility) the subordinate predicate
could be interpreted as the subject of the main predicate, in the latter case (subjective
impossibility) it cannot. Obviously, the former case, too, can be taken to mean 'there
is an impossibility as regards my seeing it', i.e. /?3sk>0a'i/ can be interpreted as an
impersonal verb, and in the same way /hi'n?, Pit1 k°i w ns.na'?/ (see above) can be
interpreted as 'there will be a long passage of time in the matter of my being there'.
From a Squamish point of view the latter translations are preferable: they allow a
uniform rendering of all /k°i/-clauses regardless of whether or not they allow an
interpretation as S or O (see also 276 fn. and 308 fn.). But in giving ""literal"" translations I have been using the simpler alternative, and I will continue to do so where
this is convenient. Note that with nominal main predicates, which allow a subject
only (to the exclusion of other relata), the question simply does not arise: in /Pn-sH 1 ?
k°i^n-s-(h)uja 1 ?/ 'I want to leave' it would be far-fetched to translate 'there is a
wish of mine as regards my leaving' — the translation 'my desire (is) my leaving'
suffices.
In the following sections examples of /k°i/-clauses are quoted. They are subdivided
on the basis of the inclusion of clitics in the factual form (see 135). The clitics which
may occur in such forms are /ua, na/, the combination / n a ^ u a / , and /nam(?), m(?)i/.
In general, factual forms without clitic or with /ua/ refer to present or future events,
forms with / n a ^ u a / to present or past events, and forms with /na/ to past events
(for the cases with /nam(?), m(?)i/, which have no relation to time, see 280). Note
the morphophonemic details mentioned in 135 (non-initial paradigm).

"XXIII
NOMINAL EXPRESSIONS258. Nominal expressions may be simple or complex.
A simple nominal expression can consist of any of the forms of the nominal
paradigm (see 130), of an /Pas-/ derivative (see 163-166), of a nominal substitute
(see 199), or of a combination of demonstrative substitute plus any of the above.
Examples: /ti'ua/ 'this one', /ta w la'm?/ 'the house', /ta'j? la'm?/ 'that house',
/ta^?as-(h)ii'/ 'the big one', /s-uat/ 'who', /k°i w na w ta l ?-s/ 'the (unknown) one who
made it', /ti_na w ta'?-s-t-as/ 'this one which he made', / k ° i _ n a ^ q ° s h a 'jaPni !?nt-umi/ 'the (unknown) one who pierced your ears'.
A complex nominal expression comprises more than one stress-group, not counting
a demonstrative substitute as first member. Such an expression consists of a nominal
head (usually a simple noun) with one or more adjuncts. Adjuncts may precede the
head, in which case they are called attributive, or they may follow the head, in which
case they are either appositional or independent. We speak of an oppositional adjunct
when the head of the adjunct has the same referent as the head of the whole nominal
expression, and of an independent adjunct when this is not the case.
A. ATTRIBUTIVE ADJUNCTS259. An attributive adjunct may be represented by any form of the nominal paradigm
(see 130) and by a phrase consisting of relator-verb plus relatum (see 271). Examples
with nouns: /ta w mi'iaX, smi'c/ 'the bear-meat', /ta w sq >0 Sa'cut snaxTty 'the toycanoe', /ta^Xa'paiPai t'k'Vmjax 0 / 'the cedar-roots'. With itr. verbs: /ta. ,hii'
mi'iaty 'the big bear', /k°i w x°a l i Xqa'iS'/ 'next month', lit. 'the appearing month'.
With tr. verbs: /k 0 3ci^,na?^t^k°3laStan mi'Xaty 'the bear I had shot' (V:10),
/ta^tx°(h)u l j[ na w ?i'p > istax° Pa'nPusqs Ca'mX/ 'the remaining two pieces of pitch
you have (you are holding)' (111:30), where /na^Pi'p'istax 0 / 'which you are holding'
is attribute to the phrase /Pa'nPusqs da'mX/ (which itself is an attribute-plus-noun
phrase), while the itr. verb /tx°(h)u'i/ is an attribute to the whole following phrase.
Examples with substitutes /PaXi^mani'X Qa'lqaliX/ 'that selfsame Q.' (1:8),
/ta w ?3-s\ja l ? P-la'm?/ 'your house', /k°3ci w n5 > u l ? la'm?/ 'the one house', 'the other176SYNTAXhouse', / u a w s u a ' t la'm?/ 'whose house?', /k°i w ?3'n£a la'm?/ 'which house?'.
Example with a relator-verb-plus-relatum phrase: /tina 1 ? X > a w Ma l ?laXaX sta'l»
max 0 / '(the) Indians from Malahead'.
B. APPOSmVE ADJUNCTS259. An appositive adjunct may in the first place be represented by any form of the
nominal paradigm, these forms referring to the head of the whole noun plus adjunct
construction (in the case of transitive forms, the object has the same referent as the
head of the whole construction). Examples: with a noun /k°aci w ,si?a l m? sm3i°i l ys/
'chief smallpox' (a term of respect resulting from fear), cf. also the last example in 261;
with itr. verbs: /k°3ci w sui'?qa na w nam w papi?a'tuX,/ 'the man who went hunting',
/ti^mi'XaX ?i w h9m?i'/ 'the bear that was coming (at me)' (V:20), /PaXi^sX'a'lqm
n a w n a l n a m ? / 'that monster that is going about' (111:8), /k°3ci w sta'y?x°X
na w mn w tx°k > 0 i l nk > 0 n/ 'the children few of whom were left', lit. 'that had become
few' (1:19), / ^ a c i ^ n - u a ' C n a w x ° i ' ? / 'my watch that is lost'; with a tr. verb: /sni'Sim
ua^Xa'lPtan/ '(the) words I am writing down'. The appositive adjunct may be a
phrase headed by a nominal form: /k°i w ia l 5u? n a w u a w t > a ' ? t a s k°3X,iwSilnuXqai?/
'the lakes which S. tried' (111:24), /k°i w sX > a l lqm y a w n a ' n t m Si'nulqai?/ 'a monster
called S.' (111:4), /k°i...§a'y? x ' W s t a s ^ P a q ' tx°na'm? tk°i w 5ma l n/ 'a bone which
he would use against enemies' (111:37); with a relator-verb plus relatum: / t a w l a ' m ?
n a ^ n a 1 ? (t-)ta^?i'Xaqa/ 'the house on the other side' (alternative / t a w l a ' m ?
t a ^ n a w ? i ' X a q a / ) . For an adjunct-phrase headed by a simple noun see the last
example of 261.
261. In the second place, an appositive adjunct may be represented by a noun
naming the possessor in a possessive construction. These constructions are of two
kinds. When the possessor is referred to by a proper name or by a personal substitute,
the head is without possessive suffix and the adjunct is in the relative case:
/k°3ci w la l m? r a ^ T a ' m / 'Tom's house', /k°aci^ma^n Va_Qa l lqaliX/ 'Q.'s lice'
(1:30), /ta w sma'nit X. > a w St > a l ?mss/ 'the mountain of Stamis* (111:7), /sya't
X'a^na'ij-iap/ 'which one of you?', / n a _ n a ' ? tk°a w ,?a l iaXq°.mi l n? X'a^ni'maty
'he is down below us', lit. 'he is at the (invisible) lower side of us' (alternative /na w n a ' P
tk°a^?a l j|aXq 0 .mi l n?-63t/ ' . . . a t our lower side'). When the possessor is not referred
to by a proper name or pers. substitute, the adjunct is in the absolutive case, and the
head has the 3rd pers. possessive suffix /-s/: /ta^la'mP-s ta^siPa'm?/ 'the house
of the chief', /k°3Xi w ma l n?-s k ^ i ^ s i P a ' m ? / 'the daughter of the chief', /ha'PX
t a w s u ' m ? - s t a ^ s p a ' q ' a m / 'the flower smells good', lit. 'good (is) the smell of the
flower', /ta w sq > 0 u'i-s kVci/ 'that (absent) one's disease'. A possessive phrase may
occur as an appositive adjunct; the head of the possessive construction has the
same referent as the head of the whole expression:
sXa 'nai? ma 'n?-s k°aci w
siPa'm?/ 'the girl, a daughter of the chief' (111:47).","[174, 175, 176]"
"Combinations of ¡X/ with possessive affixes are in all but one example preceded by
/ua/, after whose vowel /?/ in 1st pers. sing. /?n-/ is lost, while 2nd pers. /?3-/ is
dropped altogether (see 127). The forms recorded are the following: / u a w n . X _ /
'which I ...', / u a ^ , X _ / 'which you ...', / u a _ X , - s ' w h i c h he ...', /ua^^T&t/
'which we ...' (2nd and 3rd pers. plur. not recorded).
The possessive affixes may also be added to a group consisting of /X/ and a following
/na, na?-x°/ or /ua/, so that the latter units can be combined with possessive suffixes
(not prefixes!). Thus, to the 1st pers. sing. / n A w a a / there corresponds the 3rd pers.
sing. /X^ua-s/ and the 1st pers. plur. /X^ua-£at/ (2, 3 pi. not recorded).
For the zero-alternant of the complex /s-na/ in the 1st pers. plur. see 135.
223. The auxiliary /2-/ is a reduced form of the verbal root /5a(?)/ 'do, act, make'.
Its function is more than serving as a carrier for the personal suffixes: the use of /fi-/PREDICATIVE CLITICS AND SUFFIXES157at the same time posits a fact (which, to be sure, may be questioned, denied or made
hypothetical by the use of further clitics): /5-n w ?i'tut/ 'I /-n/ sleep' vs. /Pi'tut-an/
'shall I sleep (or do something else)?'. The latter predicate, with the personal suffix
added to the stem itself, and without /£-/, lacks the fact-positing quality of the,
former.
A positive answer to a question beginning with /nw a u w 5-x°.../ or / n w o u w £ - a p . . . /
'do you (s., pi.) ...?', can be given with /2-a'n/ 'I do', /5-a't/ 'we do', e.g. / n ^ a u ^
5-x° w ua w i3U?i'n?c — 5-a'n/ 'Do you understand? — Yes (I do)'.
The complexes /5-n, S-t, 5-x°, 5-a(ja)p/ could easily be interpreted as personal
pronouns for subject on the basis of such paradigms as /p'i'Pt-ka/ 'grab it!' (/-ka/
imperative suffix), /C-n. ,pJi'?t/ 'I grab it', /5-x° w p'i l ?t/ 'you grab it', etc. Such a
fusion must account for the 1st pers. plur. possessive suffix /-Cat/ 'our' (see 125).
See Syntax 331-333.
224. Of the deictic clitics, /?i/ 'here-now' is etymologically identical with the full
stem /Pi/ 'be here', /na/ 'there-then' with the full stem /na?/ 'be there, be on, be at'.
The clitics /Pi/ and /na/ refer in general to the location of an event in space and
time, either from the point of view of the speech-situation or from that of the context,
/Pi/ being the proximal and /na/ the neutral form. The two are not mutually exclusive
in the same predicative form, however, due to the ""weak"" identificatory nature of /na/
(cf. the combination of prox. and dist. elements in English ""Now then! There is
nothing here /"", where the use of then and there is likewise weak).
Both /na/ and /Pi/ are repeated in positive answers to questions containing them:
/n^sy^PmPu 1 !/ 'Is he at home?' — /na1?/ 'Yes, he is'; /?i^,?u w i-x°^h3m?i 1 / 'Are
you coming?' — /Pi1, ,6-n/ 'Yes, I am'.
225. In 3rd person finite forms /na/ has a similar fact-positing function as /£-/ with
1st and 2nd person (see 223), and the 3rd person forms that go with /5-n w X6i'us/
'I am tired', /£-x0wX.5i'us/ 'thou id.', /5-t, .XCi'us/ 'we id.', /5-apwX.5i'us/ 'you p. id:
are /na w X5i'us/ 'he is tired', /na w M5i'us-yit/ 'they are tired'; but while /£-/ performs
this function by positing the action as such, /na/ does it by pinpointing it in space
and time, and the two can be combined, e.g. /na w 5-a'n s _cu l t/ 'I did say (it)'. This
fact-positing function may be observed in the following examples involving forms of
the factual paradigm (see 133,135): /... k°i w n-s-tu'int-an/ \ I think) that I'll leave it'
versus /... k°i^n-s»na w tu l j[nt-an/ '(I regret) that I left it'. Cf. also the expressions:
/ j a ' ^ m n mn^C'a'uat-m/ 'even if he gets help', lit. 'is helped' / i a ' _ m n n a w , m n w
C'a'uat-m/ 'even though he got help'. These examples might create the impression
that /na/ corresponds to the English non-present tense. To be sure, the two do
correspond in a number of cases, but /na/ is not a tense-morpheme, it merely refers
to a fact, cf. /ni'X, na w ha'?X, ti'/ 'this one is good'; and /na/ has only in so far a
relation to time that it cannot refer to future events.
After predicates referring to location /na/ can be used in a restricted, purely local158MORPHOLOGYsense. In these cases, the morphological combination /s- + na + -s/ is not reduced
to /s-i-s/ in /k°i w s-i-s/ but the /n/ is preserved: / n a w u a w ? a ' j s t a w l a ' m ?
k°i w s-ni-s_ua w c > ic > a l p > / 'he is working inside the house' (cf., in the 1st pers.,
/C-n^ua^Pa'js tawla'm? k0iwn-s»na^.uaN_,c>ic>a'p>/ 'I am working inside the
house'), /ti-Pa'nCa k°i w s-ni-s^p > i l ?n3x°as/ 'where did he get it?'.

"XII
REDUPLICATION141. The Squamish language makes a wide use of various types of reduplication.
From a formal point of view the reduplicative formations can be subdivided into
total reduplications QVCVQfV^Ca... (in the case of longer stems, only the first two
consonants are involved) and partial reduplications, the latter subdivided into initial
reduplications CxV-QCV)^... and final reduplications C1(V)C2-yC2.
Further
differentiations of these types result from different vocalisations, from the presence
or absence of /?/ and from the position of the stress. There are cases of doubly
reduplicated forms.
In total reduplications the first syllable CVC- is called reduplication-syllable.
In general, reduplication concerns root-elements rather than affixes, cf. /s-taq-taqi'u/
'horses', reduplicated plural of /s-taqi'u/ 'horse' (both simplex and reduplicated form
preceded by the nominalizer /s-/). There are two prefixes, however, which are themselves reduplicative formations (see /XsX-/ 179:9 and /?a?-/ 179:12, cf. also 161).
As a living grammatical procedure, total reduplication serves to express plurality
or collectiveness in nouns, iteration, intensity or distributiveness in verbs, and
reference to persons in numerals. Partial (initial) reduplication expresses continuousness in verbs, reference to animals in numerals, and — with /i/ in the reduplicationsyllable — diminutiveness in nouns and verbs. The ""participial"" /?as-/ derivatives
of verbal roots (see 164-167) often contain the latter in totally or initially reduplicated
form. Besides these productive cases, reduplicative forms are found in most colordesignations and in some other quality-words, in many animal-names (total and
partial), and in a large number of individual stems; it is within the latter category
that the widest variety of types is found (and almost all instances of final and double
reduplication belong here).","[97, 98]"
"SUBSTITUTES145Squamish very often uses /mani'X/ where English has a simple personal pronoun
or zero: /cu't PaXi^mani'X. Qa'lqality 'Q. said' (1:8), /?i w na w k° w tx 0 -(h)i'u
k09Xi^,mani'X/ 'again she went upstream' (111:18).
/mani'X/ is the emphatic form of the clitic /mn/ (see 344). Occasionally it is also
used instead of /ni'X/, e.g. /mani'X ta^,?3-s?a'iqs§n na w ua w k°a l mi?n/ 'those are
your heels thumping' (1:16).
See Syntax 344.
205. The reduplicated root /?i?*° = ?i?-?*°/ (see 158) means 'all, every', also 'both',
with final reduplication /Pi'?*0-a*7 'all of them (persons), everybody'; a more exact
translation is 'to constitute a totAlity'. Examples: /?i'?*° w 5-ap ha'PA, (sui'Pqa)/
'you are all good people' (also/5-ap w ?i l ?i°.../);/?i l ?X°^5-t ua^ni'Cim sqX°u'?miS/
'we all speak Squamish'; /5-t^Pi 1 ?* 0 MSi'us/ 'we are all tired';
to'lP.nax0
!
ta^sqXVPmiS sni'iim/ 'I know all Squamish words'; /na w ?i ?*° ji'PuX/ 'it's all
burnt'; /ha'u q a ^ X ^ n a ^ P i 1 ? * 0 mu'i/ 'she did not submerge completely' (III: 18);
/namwhi?alm?»n3x°-as ?i'?X°-aX°/ 'he went and took all of them home' (1:35);
/na^tu'jn-t-m ?i'?X°-ait0 t-k°a w sq > 3q , °u l ?-s/ 'he was left by all his companions';
/ a - n _ u a w § u l k ' ° u m Pi1?*0 sk°a'il/ 'I bathe every day'; /Pi1?*0 sta'm/ 'everything',
/Pi1?*0 Pa'nSa/ 'everywhere' (for 'always' there is a separate word ¡Xiq7).
Note especially /na w ?i'?*7 'it's all gone', 'there is none left'; /£-n_?il?X0-s/
'I finish it', lit. 'cause it to be all (gone)'.
Possessive /s-ua?/
206. For the expression of the general relation of object to (grammatical) person
loosely labeled ""possessive"" Squamish employs possessive affixes (see 128). Independent possessive reference ('mine', 'yours', etc.) is made by means of the stem
/s-ua?/ combined with the possessive affixes (a special form in the 1st pers. plur.,
see below). These forms refer to actual possessions in the narrow sense of the word.
The stem /s-ua?/ may therefore be interpreted as meaning 'possession'; it does not
occur independently, however, but is used only with possessive affixes. The forms
are /Pn-s-ua1?/ 'mine', /s-?u-ty 'ours' (with /-?u-/ < /-ua?-/ and an element /-X/
reminiscent of /ni'maX/ 'we', / - u m u ' 1 s t pers. plur. object'), /?a-s-ua'?(-iap)/ 'thine
(yours)', /s-ya'?-s(-uit)/ 'his (theirs)'.
These forms are used in three different ways. In the first place they occur independently, e.g. /Pa(s)-s3lq> k°i w ?a-sua 1 ?/ 'it's half yours', 'half (of it) belongs to
you'. In the second place, the 3rd pers. forms can be combined with a noun or
proper name indicating the possessor, e.g. /sua'P-s k°a w nTina l n ta w la'ni?/ 'the
house is my father's'. In the third place, the forms can be combined with nouns
provided with possessive affixes (so that the latter appear twice in one phrase), e.g.
/ha'PA. ta^Pa-sua 1 ? P-la'm?/ 'your house is good', /Pn-sua1? n-sq°mali? ti'/ 'this is
my dog', 'this dog belongs to me' (cf. /ni'X. n-sq0ma'i? ti'ua/ 'this is my dog'). The146MORPHOLOGY2nd pers. plur. suffix /-¿ap/ may be added either to /sua?/ or to the noun:
/ta_?3-sua'?-iap Pa-si1 q£/ or /ta_?3-sua'P Ps-si'qC-iap/ 'your pi. shingles'.
/Pas-/ derivatives (see 164) cannot be combined with possessive affixes, and here
the use of combinations with /sua?/ is obligatory: /ta w n-sua'P Pas-p'a'q0/ 'my slab',
/ta^Pa-sua'P Pos-p'o'q°/ 'your slab', /ta w sua'?-s Pas-p'a'q""/ 'his slab', etc.
IndefiniteSubstitutes207. The numeral /n6'u?/ 'one' (see 212) is also used in the sense '(the) one', '(the)
other' and 'a certain'. Its alternant /na6'/ means 'different' (cf. also /na'C-i/ 'change;
itr.', /na'S'-an/ 'id.; tr.', / n a ^ n a '¿'rnauPas/ 'differ from each other /-nauPas/',
/na'-na5'/ 'wrong'); the word is also used in the sense of'several, some' (cf. German
'verschiedene'). Examples: /ni'X ni'-ni'u'P n-S3q°i'?tl ti'ua/'that's my other brother';
/na 1 ? t-k°3ci, .nC'u1? na'tty 'on a certain morning' (IV: 1). /k 0 3ci^na l £ > -au?tx 0 / 'the
other room' (the same word means 'one house', see 217); /x°i w na l 6 5 k ° a c i w n a w
ua^n-s-c'ic'a'pV 'I'm working on a different job', lit. 'different (is) that which is
my work'; /ta w na'5 > ta^s-kn-Xa'naj?/ 'some of the women' (IV:33).
208. The root /Pi'na/, before a vocalic suffix /Pin-/, refers to '(the) one', '(the) other'
(of a pair): /ti .Pi'na/ 'this one (not the other)', also /na 1 ? t i w ? i ' n a / 'over yonder';
/ti^n-s-Pi'na-qa/ 'my one (other) leg'; /ti w n-s-?i'n i aC/ 'my one (other) hand';
/ti wn-STnax°-Pi'n2a'jus/ 'my one (other) eye' (for /nax°-/ see 172); / n a w x ° i ' ?
k°3ci w n-s-Pi l na-qa ?n-q°Xil?sn/ 'I lost one of my shoes', lit. 'it got lost my one (side
of) my shoes'; cf. /k°3ci w .n-s-?i l n i a5 n-c'qVPlafi/ 'one of my gloves' (suff. /-a£/
'hand').
A /-t/-derivative of the root /Pi'na/ serves as an interrogative: /?i'na-t/ 'say what?'
(see 85), in negative sentences also '(not) say anything'. Examples: /na w ?i'na-t/
'what did he say?', / n a w u a w ? i ' n a - t / 'what was he saying?', /5-x° w Pi l na-t/ 'what did
you say?', /ha'y q ^ ? a s w i a w ? i ' n a - t ta^X^'fi'ta'l?/ 'X. didn't say anything' (III: 13).
A derivative with /tx°-/ was recorded in one example; /tx°-?i'na-t/ could be translated literally 'be towards saying what?', cf. /tx 0 -?i'na-t k°i w ?3-s»ni'£im/ 'what have
you got to say?', more literally 'about what will be your speaking?'.
InterrogativeSubstitutes209. The identificatory interrogatives are /s-uat/ 'who?' and /s-tam/ 'what?', both
often combined with the clitic /maty (see 235): /sua l t(_maX) ta'i?/ 'who is that?',
/sta'm w (m)aA, k°a'ci/ 'what was that?' (on hearing a noise outside or in another part
of the house). Note: /sta'm k°i s _ sna 'P-s/ 'what is it called?' but /sua't k ° i ^ sna 'P-s/
'what is his name?'. In two examples /stam/ was recorded with the indefinite article
/k°i/: /k°i w sta'm uaw tx°-ta'ta-nit-ajap/ 'what are you pi. discussing?' (alternative:
/sta'm k°a w ua s _,tx°t3 l tanitaiap/); for the second example see below.","[144, 145, 146]"
"DICTIONARYINTRODUCTION TO DICTIONARYOrganization
The alphabetic order is as follows:
p p ' m 1t> c c ' s n 5 c>s X V 1 k k> k° k'° x° q q' q° q'° X X° h u i a a u i
/?/ is disregarded for alphabetical purposes; note that /PI-/ is found under /I/, etc.
To mark the order: 1. place of articulation from front to back; 2. plos. —fric. —
nasal or liquid; 3. glottalic follows plain cons.; 4. labialized conss. follow plain ones;
sonants and corresponding vowels come at the end.
All stems (see 79) and all affixes recorded are entered, except for combinations
with productive lexical affixes, of which examples are quoted under the heading of
the underlying stem, while under the heading of the affix reference is made to the
lists in the Morphology (where more examples are given).
All derivatives of the same root are quoted under the heading of the root or of
the simplest suffixed form; the derivatives are also entered separately, except if in
the alphabetic order they would follow immediately the item where the whole wordfamily is quoted. Where roots have full- and zero-grade alternants the word-family
is brought together under the heading of the full-grade form.
Roots found only non-initially in complexes are entered as separate items except
for the numerous cases with the nominalizer /s-/. In other words, the totality of
roots is found under the headings / Q . . . / plus /sC^.../. I write /s-C/ when there is
evidence that /s-/ is a prefix, otherwise /sC/, though there is no doubt that the overwhelming majority of the latter cases likewise involve the nominalizer.
Each heading consists maximally of four parts: (1) the item itself with translation,
(2) examples of use, (3) derivatives, see above, (4) etymological information. Part (3)
is preceded by a dash, part (4) by the symbol O. Under (2) the symbol ~ represents
the item as quoted under (1); affixes are separated from ~ by /-, */.
Etymologies
Etymologies are given of root-morphemes only, not of affixes. For comparisons
outside Squamish the following sources have been used: Halcomelem\ Elmendorf-246DICTIONARYSuttles 1960, Shuswap: own recordings*, Cœur d'Alerte: Reichard 1939,Kalispel:Vogt 19401, 19402. Doubtful comparisons are indicated by ""Cf.?"".
Of the abovementioned languages, Halcomelem is by far the closest to Squamish.
Of the three dialects treated by Elmendorf and Suttles, viz. Cowichan (Cw.), Musqueam (Ms.) and Chilliwack (Ch.), the first is phonetically closest to Sq., and in
general I quote only Cw. forms, unless a Ms. or Ch. form is in some respect closer
to Sq. than the Cw. one, or a word is lacking in Cw., or additional information is
relevant in some other way.
The Hale, consonants proper are identical to the Sq. ones, except for the following
(one-to-one) correspondences :
Sq. /c, c7
Sq. /£, <?/
Sq. /§/
Sq. /sx°/Hale. /0, ç'/ (interdental)
Hale, /c, c'/
Cw. /§/, Ms., Ch. /x*/
Hale, /sx0/No Hale, equivalents are available of words with /k, k'/i these are undoubtedly
borrowings in Sq., at least in part from Salish languages which did not shift the
velars to palatals. Most of them belong to specific semantic categories (games;
birds, butterfly; artifacts; nursery-words).
The Sq. sonants /m, n, 1, u, h/ correspond to Hale, /m, n, 1, w, h/ (of the latter
few examples and several deviations). Of the Sq. words with /Vh/ several have
counterparts with long vowels in Cw. and Ms. (Ch. has in part replaced the glottal
stop by vowel-length, so that the incidence of the latter is vastly extended here);
see Dictionary under Vpuh, P^h, /sp'ahc', Xshm, X°uhq>0/.
The Sq.-Halc. sonants /n, 1/ are merged into /l/ in Ch. and into /n/ in some Ms.
dialects. Sq. has borrowed words from both types of dialects.
The correspondences involving /j/ and vowels are less simple. They are listed
here (Sq. /I/ is included for the sake of comparison):
Sq- /I/
Sq. Fh i/
Sq. IH
Sq. /it
Sq. N
Sq. /i/
Sq. /u/
Sq. /a'/
Sq. /u/Hale. /I/ (54 cases)
Hale. /I/ (27 cases)
Hale, /y/ (28 cases)

Hale, /ay(a), ey(a), ay/ (21 cases)
Hale, /a, e/ (24 cases, all unstressed in Hale.)
Hale, /a, E, A/ (59 cases)
Hale, /a1/ (17 cases)
Hale, /aw/ (4 cases)Additional vowel-correspondences concern vowels in unstressed syllables and are
of lesser significance.

"178SYNTAXD. USE OF ARTICLES266. In the large majority of cases the (nominal) predicate lacks an article, while the
expressions for subject, object and other nominal relata are provided with them. For
examples see the sentences quoted in 244ff. Only when a class-noun is used to refer
to an individual as such, an article is used in the nominal predicate, e.g. /ta w ?3s(h)ii'
n-sX'i'P/ 'I want the big one', 'it is the big one I want'. An ""individualizing"" nominal
predicate referring to a 3rd person is usually introduced by /niX/ (see 252), e.g.
/ni'X ta w ?3s(h)ii' n-sX'i1?/ 'I want the big one'. With personal substitutes no article
is used: /Pa'ns n a ^ t a ' P s / ' / made it', 'it's me who made it' (note that in all other
syntactic positions these substitutes are provided with articles, see 201). An article
is also lacking in a nominal predicate with a possessive affix (all examples preceded by
/niX/):/ni'X n-k°u'pic ta'i?/'that's my (elder) brother',/ni'X n-sua1? ti 1 /'this one is
mine'. Proper names behave in the same way as personal substitutes: /Pi'ta
na w k >0 a'5.n3x°as t a ^ T a ' m / 'it is Peter who saw Tom'; this is also true when the
name refers to itself: /Pi'ta k°i s _na^ua w s-na'ntcasuit/ 'Peter is what they call me'.
267. The subject lacks an article precisely in those cases where the predicate refers to
the individual as such, either with an article, e.g. /ta^?as(h)ii' nsX'i'P/ 'I want the
big one', or with a deictic stem, e.g. /na'u n-sja'j?/ 'you are my friend', /ni'X ta'i?
n-sja'j?/ 'that one is my friend' (versus /ha'?X ta^n-sia'j?/ 'my friend is good'). Note
the alternative expressions / k ° i ^ s t a ' m ua w tx°ta'tanitaiap/ or /sta'm k ° a ^ u a _
tx°ta'tanitajap/ 'what are you pi. discussing?'.
An article may be lacking in the subject of a sentence with /ci?/ 'there is' (see 257)
if this subject contains a possessive affix: /ci'? ( t i w , k°3ci w )nTla'm?/ 'I have a house'.
The same goes for sentences with quantitative predicates: /Pa'nPus n-sn3x°i'X/ 'I have
two canoes', /PnPa'nPus n-sqa'?q/ 'I have two (younger) siblings', /tx°(h)u'j
na^Pi'p'istan/ 'it's all I've left', / q a ' i n-sc'ic'a'p'/ 'I have much work'; here, too, an
article is possible, e.g. /qa'X ta w n-sq > 0 u'j.n3x7 'I've caught a lot', lit. 'many (are) my
killed ones'.
Numerical expressions lack an article when mere counting is involved, e.g.
/£-nv_^q>cu'i.n3x° Pa'nPus mi'XaX/ 'I have killed two bears'. When a number is
specified independently (and not merely given as the result of a count), an indefinite
article must be used. Example: /pa-srmn^ta'pstax 0 k°i w Xa?u'cn-qs/ 'then you
(must) make four pieces' (111:26). When an individual counted group (rather than
a mere number of objects belonging to a class) is referred to, a definite article or
demonstrative is used: /k°3'ci*uit Sniia'nat siuPi'Pqa/ 'the (those) three men' (11:2),
/ni'X Ps-srmn w ci 1 qin?tax° t-ta w ?a'n?us-qs Ca'mX/ 'then you (must) spear it with
the two pieces of pitch' (111:29). Note the different word-order in /C-n^Xa'lPt
ta v _qa l X sni'Cim/ 'I write down many words' as against / n a ^ t u ' j n t m Pi'?X°aX0
t-k°a^sq > 3q > °u'?-s/ 'he was left by all his companions'.
An article is lacking in the relatum of the passivized causative verb /syo'Pu-s-t-m/
'be called', lit. 'be caused to be one who is called': / u a ' P ^ t sua'Pustm Pi'ta/ 'he usedNOMINAL EXPRESSIONS179to be called Peter' (otherwise in /¡S-n^ua^na'-n-t-m t-k°i w Pi'ta/ 'I am called
Peter', see 270).
An article is also lacking in certain nominalized verb-forms after predicates
referring to location, see 317.
268. The indefinite article /k°i/ is used in one type of subordinate clauses, the predicate
of which consists of a factual form. These subordinate predicates behave differently
from nominal expressions, see 275 (for an exceptional case of nominal use see 283).","[177, 178, 179]"
"XXIV
SECONDARY RELATA269. Secondary Relata (R2, see 248) may consist of nominal or verbal expressions;
accordingly, we distinguish nominal and verbal secondary relata.
A. NOMINAL SECONDARY RELATA270. Nominal secondary relata correspond in the first place to English prepositional phrases, e.g. /nawX.i'fi>itas ta w smi'c t-ta^Xa'fc'tn/ 'he cut the meat with
the knife', /na w q >0 u l q°utcas t-k°aci w q >0 q°a l mn/ 'he hit me with an ax',
/na w ci'qin?tcas t-k'aci^p'a'c'tn/ 'he stabbed me with a needle', /na w ca'x°ntas
ta w sui'?qa t-ta^sma'nt/ 'he hit (threw at) the man with the stone', /5-n w p3 l X°n
ta^sui'Pqa t-ta^t'u'jPt/ lit. 'I spit at the man with the medicine (chewed medicinal
herbs)'; the latter two sentences are the normal translations of 'he threw the stone
at the man' and 'I spit medicine on the man'; in the same way /Xit'u'sn-ka
taN_s?i'x°aX. t-ta^sta'q 0 / 'sprinkle the water on the child's face!', lit. 'face-sprinkle
the child with the water!'.
With intrans. verbs: /nawX.'3,iq> tawmi'XaX, t-ta w jta'sSn/ 'the bear got caught
(squeezed) in the trap', /na w q°u l i ^aci^n-sui'tn t-k°3ciwq°X.ali?/ 'my net got
hooked up on a log'.
With act.-itr. verbs, nominal secondary relata allow English translations as direct
objects as well as prepositional phrases, e.g. / n a w u a w t a h i ' m ? t-k°9ciwk>°alx°a?/
'he is making a box', 'he is working on a box', /na^cx°i'm? t-ta w sma'nt/ 'he threw
(with) the stone'. In the following, more complex example with an itr. verb, the
English phrasing has to be quite different from Squamish: /nawlix°-a'i?X-m ta_Ta'm
t-PaXi^ma'nP-s tx°.nalm? Va^Pi'ta/ 'Tom gave his daughter (in marriage) to Peter'.
/lix°-a'i?X-m/ is a suffixed and intransivized verb of the type described in 180: action
performed by the subject on his own X (in this case X is not a body-part but one's
child /-ai?Xf). The root /lix0/ means 'fall down', trans. /lix°-t/ 'put down', so that
/lix0a'i?Xm/ may be translated 'put down one's child; itr.'. The noun 'his child'
appears separately as R2 /t-PaXi^ma'nP-s/ (feminine article; relative case), so that
the phrase means literally 'he-put-down-his-child with-regard-to-his-daughter' = 'heSECONDARY RELATA181gave his daughter in marriage' (LM gave the translation 'he put down his daughter
to P.). For the phrase ^"".mi'm? Va^Pi'ta/ see 271 and 273.
The verb /na-n/ 'call, name; tr.' takes an R2 specifying the name: /6-n w ua w na'n-t-m t-k°i, .Pi 'ta/ 'I am called (by the name of) Peter', /na w ua^na'-n-t-c-as-uit
(t-)k°i Pi'ta/ 'they call me Peter'. For an exceptional type of construction with
*/su3'?u-s/ see 267, end.
271. In the second place, nominal secondary relata correspond to English prepositional objects, namely in those cases where they are combined with relator-verbs,
e.g. /«S-n^ua^na 1 ? X'a^Pa'lqsn/ 'I am at Point Grey', /tina'? w 5-n A,>awSqX°u1?mi§/ 'I am from Squamish', /?3sq>9q>0u'?^5-n X'a^Ta'm/ 'I am with Tom'. In
these examples the relator-verb is the predicate of the sentence; it may also itself
occupy the position of (verbal) secondary relatum, see 273.
B. VERBAL SECONDARY RELATA272. A verbal secondary relatum is the second member of a group of two finite verbs;
this second member is almost always without clitics, except when the first member
means 'continue, do still', in which case the 2nd member is preceded by the clitic /ua/.
This clitic was recorded in only one other combination of this type. Examples:
/£-n w ua w ns?i' ni'Cim/ 'I speak loud', lit. 'I am loud (in) speaking', /S-n^ti'micut
Pi'sun/ 'I paddle as hard as I can', /5-n w ti'micut ck>0a'cut/ 'I run as fast as I can',
lit. 'I exert myself to the utmost (in) paddling, running', /¡S-n^ua^pa'im PaXi'c/
'I am lying down and resting', lit. 'I am resting (in) lying down', /5-n w c > a'c > i?i
Xa'l?/ 'I write fast', lit. 'I hurry (in) writing', / n a ^ k ^ P i 1 ? * 0 c'a'ls/ 'they're all clean
now', lit. 'they constitute a totality (in) being clean', /na w ?i'?X° ji'PuX/ 'it's all
burnt', lit. 'it is all of it (in) being burnt', /s-s w mn w .k°3 l n x°ali2q°-m?-uit/ 'then they
began to wash their heads' (IV:28), /?3sk >0 a| k ^ s - t r i P a ' m P - s nax^STna'nPp/ 'it
was impossible for him to follow right on her trail' (III: 16), lit. 'his doing it really (in)
following ...', /?i w na w k° w huj[a l ? tx°-(h)i'u/ 'again he departed (going) upstream'
(111:23). With tr. verbs: / ? i _ > n w ? i w k ° w q i ? a ' t Xi'5it/ 'I am cutting it again',
lit. 'I repeat (in) cutting it', /?i_na w ,k°^tx°-(h)i l u ... su'k^um/ 'again he moved
upstream, bathing' (111:25), / ? i w k 0 w n a w m n w ( n ) s ? i ! t Ps'linitas/ 'until he had a
clear dream-vision of her', lit. 'until he did it distinctly, dreaming about her' (111:25).
Examples with /ua/ in the 2nd member: /5-n w ,mn w u3 l ?u ua^su'k^um, ... u a _
c'ic'a'p7 'I continue bathing, working', / ? i w £ - n ^ m n w ^ V i ya w c'ic > a l p > / 'I am
still working'; otherwise only in /6-n w ua w sqX°u l ?mi§ ua^ni'iim/ 'I speak
Squamish'.
There are cases where main verb and verbal relatum can be interchanged without
much difference in meaning, e.g. /Ai'C'it-ka qiPa't/ 'cut it again!', lit. 'cut it repeating'
and /qiPa't-ka XVS'it/ 'id.\ lit. 'repeat cutting it'; /5-n s- ,ua_ni l £im sqX°u'?mi5/
'I speak Squamish' and /6-n w ua w sqX 0 u l ?nu§ ua^_ni'£im/ 'id.', lit. 'I Squamish (it)
while speaking'.","[179, 180, 181]"

MARGINAL WORDS242. There is only a small number of words which do not fit the morphological and
syntactic pattern of nouns and verbs. They fall into three groups: conjunctions,
adverbs and interjections. Some of these elements are identical with clitics, and many
consist of petrified combinations of the latter. With regard to adverbs it must be
noted that Squamish generally uses verbs where English has adverbs, cf. such typical
cases as 'not' and 'very', rendered in Squamish by the verbs /hau/ 'be not the case',
'do not' and /Pan/ 'be or act to a high degree'. The marginal words are listed in the
next section; for examples of use see Dictionary and sections of Syntax referred to.
243. Conjunctions: /?i, ?i'k°i/ 'and' (363, 365), /uaX/ 'and, while, so that, for, until,
but' (358), /ia'mn/ 'although, even if' (359), /iaX,/ '(and) then' (362), /hui/ 'but' (361).
Adverbs: /Ca'PXa/ 'for a little while', /Cia'X/ 'soon', /c'umX,/ 'just, a little while ago',
/Pi'X-'i/ 'still, all the time', /Pi'mn/ 'also, too', /iaX,/ 'finally, at last' (345/.; also a
conjunction, see above), /tm-ta'm/ 'when?', /PiuPa'iti/ 'maybe', /PiuPa'nity 'must be,
must have been'.
Interjections: /na/ 'there you are!' (handing over something), /k'°3h, k'°a/ 'don't
know, maybe, am not sure' (expression of doubt), /jah, PaPa'i, PiPa'i/ 'I see! well!
indeed!' (expression of interest in a story told), /ju/ 'bah' (contempt, disgust), /?u/
'allright then' (Russian nu ladno).","[164, 165]"
"XXII
THE PREDICATE249. A predicate may occur by itself, without explicit nominal references to subject,
object and other relata. If the predicate-word is a noun or intransitive verb, it
implies a reference to a subject only. If the subject is 1st or 2nd person, this reference
is made by a subject-suffix attached to the clitic /5-/> regardless of whether the predicateword is a noun or verb. The clitic may precede or follow the predicate-word; in the
latter case it occasionally has a stress of its own, especially when the predicate-word
is monosyllabic. If the subject is 3rd person, there is no explicit reference to it, but
the predicate is often ""concretized"" by the clitic /na/ 'there, then'. This clitic always
precedes the predicate-word. Examples of intrans, predicates: /5-nwc>ic>alp>/ or
/c'icVp^ò-n/ 'I work', /(naw)c'ic>alp>/ 'he works'; /5-n w ha'?ty or /ha'?X_5-n,
ha'?XwC-aln/ 'I am good', /(na_)ha'?ty 'he is good', 'it is good'; /fi-n^sui'Pqa/ or
/syi'Pqa w 5-n/ 'I am a man', /sui'Pqa/ 'he (it) is a man'; /6-x0wn-sia'i?/ or /?n-sia'i?_
5-x°/ 'you are my /(?)n-/ friend', /Pn-sja'i?/ 'he (it) is my friend'; /toq >0 / 'it's dark',
/Xa'XmPx0/ 'it's rainy', /k>0in/ 'they (things) are few', 'there are few (things)',
/nawn-s.malk>°m/ 'I found (rather than bought, received, made) it', lit. 'it is my /n-/
find /s-m3lk>0-m/'. Note the expressions /6-x°^X>i'q/ 'hello!' (said to a person
arriving), lit. 'you arrive'; /6-x°whi4a1?/ 'goodbye!' (said to a person leaving), lit.
'you depart'; /hu'i w 5-x° w ?a/ 'thank you!', lit. 'you are ready /hu[/', with the
emphatic clitic /Pa/ (see 236).
If an attribute-plus-noun phrase is used predicatively, the clitic follows the
attribute, e.g. /ha'PX. sui'Pqa/ '(he is a) good man', /ha'PX^fi-x0 sui'Pqa/ 'you are a
good man'.
250. If the predicate-word is a (non-passivized) transitive verb, it implies references to
both a subject and an object, the latter being represented by a suffix for the 1st and
2nd person and by zero in the 3rd. For these suffixes and the particulars of their use
see 123-126; a complete transitive paradigm is given in 131. Note that the transitive
finite verb, unlike the intransitive, expresses the 3rd pers. subject with the subjectsuffix /-as/. The expression of 1st and 2nd pers. subject is the same as with itr. verbs,
and again the clitic may precede or follow: /5-n w qi'st-umi/ or /qi'st-u'mi^ò-n/172SYNTAX' I dislike you' (cans, /qi-s/, cf. / q s j j 'bad', see 91). With a 3rd pers. subject the clitic
/na/ is frequently there, but not obligatory: /(na w )siX.a?a'nt-as/ 'he bought it'.
251. If in a predicate with 1st or 2nd pers. subject the clitic precedes the predicateword, the predicate is neutral as to emphasis. If the clitic follows, the predicate-word
is emphasized as compared to the personal element. The latter order is furthermore
frequent when the speaker wishes to express an intention rather than a fact; it is
obligatory when a command rather than a statement is given. For instance,
/5-x° w n-sia'i?/ 'you are my friend' is a bare statement of fact, while /?n-sia'i? w 5-x7
lays more stress on the part '(are) my friend'. (In order to stress 'you', the personal
element must be made the predicate: /na'u Pn-sja'i?/ 'you are my friend'). The
utterance /5-n w 5 > a'uat-umi/ normally stands for 'I help you' but can occasionally
be used for 'I'll help you (right now)', the latter meaning usually being expressed
/£ > a'uat-u l mi w 5n/ (which, in turn, can also mean 'I help you'). Cf. further /huja 1 ?^
£-n(wmaX,)/ 'I'm going, (now)', /k , 0 a'£t w £-n/ 'I'll take a look'. Commands:
/5'a'uat w £-x 0 / 'help him!' (a frequent alternative for /6'a'uat-ka/, with the imperativesuffix /-ka/), /¿'a'uat-u'muX.^-x 0 / 'help us!' (also /...X,-ka/), /iu'h w 5-a'x°/ 'be
careful!'.
In many cases the two alternatives are used without discernible difference in
meaning, e.g. /tina'? w 5-n X'a^Pa'lqsn/ or /5-n^tina'? X'a^Pa'lqsn/ 'I am from
Pt. Grey', /ti?3'n5a_5-a'x7 or /5-x° w ti?3'n5a/ 'where are you from?'
252. A 3rd pers. intransitive predicate lacks the deictic reference to the subject, which
in 1st and 2nd pers. forms is made by /in, £t, £x°, 6ap/; instead, such a predicate is
often introduced by /niX/ (see 203): /ni'X n-sja'j?/ 'it (he) is my friend'. In addition,
a strong deictic element may follow: /ni'X. n-sja'i? ta'i?/ 'he's (that's) my friend',
lit. 'he is my friend, that one', /ni'X, n-k°u'pic ti'ua/ 'this is my brother'. Here /ta'i?,
ti'ua/ fill the syntactic position of subject to the predicates /ni'X, n-sia'j?..., ni'X
n-k°u'pic.../; in order to stress 'he', 'that', etc., the deictic word must be put in the
position of predicate: /ni'X, ta'i? n-sia'i?/'he (that one) is my friend', lit. 'he is that
one, my friend'. Compare:/ni'X, n-sX'i'? ta'i?/ 'I want that' vs. /ni'X, ta'i? n-sX'i'?/
'I want that (one)', lit. 'my desire is that (one)'. See further the examples given in 203.
253. When subject, object, etc., are made explicit by nominal expressions, these
follow the predicate in the manner described in 245-248. To the possible sentencetypes summed up there, there exists the following restriction: a combination of a
3rd pers. trans, verb with a noun in the absolutive case (VtNa), when produced in
isolation, represents VtO and not VtS. For example, /na^C'a'mPt-as ta^sq°ma'i?/
is understood as 'he bit the dog' and not as """"the dog bit him', even though
/na w/ £ > a'm?tas/ by itself means 'he bit him' and S and O are both in the absolutive
case. In isolation, 'the dog bit him' is rendered by a passive construction VpR^
/na^CVmPt-m t-ta w sq°ma'i?/, lit. 'he was bitten by the dog' (cf. the sentence VPS
/na^S'a'mPt-m ta w sq°ma'i?/ 'the dog was bitten').","[170, 171, 172]"
"104MORPHOLOGYB. PARTIAL (INITIAL) REDUPLICATION
The general type is CV-C(V)C, subdivided on the basis of the vocalism of root- and
reduplication-syllable as follows:
I. /QA^CiAxCjj/: /Ca-CaC, Ci-CiC, Cu-CuC/
II. /QA-QCj,/:
/Ca-CC, Ci-CC, Cu-CC/ni. /oc^oocy
IV. / C j i - C ^ C , /v. / q v p - q o o q /
In a few instances of type II, C 2 is represented by /i/, which appears as /i?/ in the
root-syllable of the reduplicated form.
Type III parallels both I and II: it concerns roots with /a/, or with /a, i, u/ which
— precisely because they are reduplicated by /Ca-/ — are considered to represent
*/ah, aj, au/.
Type I, III and V, when derived from monosyllabic stems, have the stress on the
reduplication-syllable; in the case of suffixed stems the stress can also fall on the
suffix or, more rarely, on the root-syllable.
In type II the vowel of the reduplication-syllable is often identical with that of the
vocalized form of the root, e.g., /p'a-p'k 0 / 'float' (Vp'ak 0 -), /?3s-li'-I?x°/ 'lying
(down)' (Vlix 0 -), /Sui-§p-n/ 'whistle' (\/3up-).
From a semantic point of view, there are four categories of cases where partial
initial reduplication plays a role: (1) in durative, frequentative or intensive verbderivatives, (2) in diminutive derivations, (3) in /Pas-/ derivatives of verbs and (4) in
the numerals used to count animals. The latter two categories are also treated
separately under their respective headings (see 166, 213). There are, in addition, a
large number of cases where reduplicative formations have become lexicalized.
The durative, frequentative and intensive verb-derivatives belong for the most part
to type I and III, the /Pas-/ derivatives to type II and III (for some cases of total
reduplication in /Pas-/ derivatives see 167).
Partial I:/C^-QAjCy154. Roots with /a/.— Verbs: /pV-p'atf/ 'be very hot', /p'a'-p'akMu)^/ 'play with
toy-canoe' (AP), /p'a'-p'ajPaq-n, p'a-p'a'jPaq-n/ 'correct, cure', /tV-t'ajaqV 'be angry',
/cV-tfaX,/ 'watch curiously' (no simplex recorded), /sa'-§am-q°/ 'stick the head out
of the water', /Xa'-XaS-i?/ 'get dark', /Xa'-Xay?/ 'recover, escape', /k°a L k°ai?l/ 'dawn',
/k >0 a'-k ,0 as-i?/ 'become summer', /k'°ai-k>0ai?/ 'be very hungry', /?os-k°a'-k°ai?/
'hidden', /qV-q'axM?/ 'become callous', /Pa'-Pai.nsx0/ 'be alive', /Pa'-PauPt/ 'go
behind', /ia L iaq >0 -am/ 'sweat'.
Others: /t'a'-t'aX./ 'loom', /s-la'-lau/ 'body', /s-na-na'i*max7 'the Nanaimo people',
/q'a'-q'ap.naC/ 'a village on the Squamish River', /q'a'-q'au/ 'skate', /s-q'a-q'ay'Sq/
(stress unknown) 'hips'.","[103, 104]"
"40PHONOLOGY44. In unstressed syllables a morpheme-initial /?/ is sometimes dropped after a
consonant, e.g. /s-(?)3q>0i'?tl/ 'siblings and cousins' (also /?3q>0i'?tl/). I write /(?)/
only in cases where /?/ is usually or always absent. The /?/ in the 1st pers. sing,
possessive prefix /?n-/ is always dropped after a clitic connected with the word of
which it is a part: /Pn-sja1!?/ '(he is) my friend' versus /ta, .n-sja'j?/ 'my friend'; it
is usually absent in all other sentence-medial positions. This case is very frequent,
and instead of /(?)n-/ I write simply /n-/ here. The 2nd pers. possessive prefix /?©-/
is normally dropped in the 2nd pers. subject forms of the factual paradigm (see 133)
after the article /k°i/, and here I write /(?s-)/; the use of the prefix may well be artificial.
45. In a few cases glottalic consonants seem to have lost their glottal feature when
preceded by /?/. The root-final glottalic cons, in /siS'/ 'be all around', /SiC-a'n/
'circle around; tr.' was recorded /£/ in /§i'-§i?2/ 'round', and /t/ was recorded in
/mu L m?t-m/ 'blue grouse', but cf. Cw. mrt' 'id.'. In these cases /?/ is characteristic
of reduplicative formations (see 71). Cf. also /Pas-iu'Pk0/ 'stingy' vs. Cw. ewk>0
'wealth, property'. On the other hand, an unexpected /k >0 / was recorded in
/s-?9-k>0al?-k°la§/ 'wound', probably < */s-?a?-k°al?-k°la§/, and in any case a
reduplicative derivative of /kVlaS/ 'shoot, sting'. To sum up, in two cases /?K/
seems to be a secondary development of /?K'/, in one / K 7 certainly represents an
original /?K/, and for /?3siu?k°/ vs. Cw. ewk'° both interpretations are possible,
though Sq. /n3X°-iuk°-a1?min/ 'what belongs to a stingy person', CdA. du?uk° 'be
stingy', Kal. yayu'k°e? 'stingy' suggest the second one for Cw. ewk'°. — But cases
of /?K7 were also recorded, e.g. /sc'i'uPq'/ 'elderberry'. It is not impossible that /?K/
and /?K'/ are in free variation in Squamish.
46. In a small number of words geminated or long consonants occur. Where these
are found in medial position they are combined with a double stress if one of the
adjacent vowels is /a/, and this /a/ is in several cases irregular in comparison to nongeminated counterparts of these words (see below). I write these geminates /C.C/,
where /./ fulfills the double function of indicating that the consonants do not merge,
and that the second one is not syllabic (in the cases with /n.n/). Such geminates
occur without double stess in /s-?a't.tam/ 'things, stuff, belongings' (probably a
derivative of /s-tam/ 'what?') and in /PaC.fca'uam/ 'to spawn', /(n-)s-?a5.£a'uam/
'conger eel'. With double stress they occur in four of the numerals referring to days:
/t , 3 l k >0 .k >0 usa l £/ '7 days', with a surprising /a/ in the first syllable, as compared to
/ t ' a k ' W C / '7', /ta'q.qa'5/ '8 days', cf. /tqa8/ '8', /Pu'p.pa'n/ '10 days', cf. /Pu'pn/ '10'
and /ci'ja'Cis = ca'i.ja'iis/ [-e - 'ja - '] '5 days', /s-ci'ja'Cis/ 'Friday', cf. /ci'afcis/ 'five';
without double stress in the numeral /?a'n.n?us/ '2 animals' (possibly a misrecording
for */?a'?n?us/, see 213). Further in two non-numerical words: /nax'-ua'u.ya'nm/
[-ua'u^ua -1 -] 'be surprised', /tina'n.na'Pt/ in the expression /\}a^n.X w tina , n.na l ?t/
[uAnXtene'nna'Pt] 'my deceased father', lit. 'the past one I am from', cf. /tina1?/ 'be
from' (where /ti-/ means 'from' and /na?/ '(be) at').","[39, 40]"

alternant /n-/ appears before consonants proper.
170. In the following cases a movement over or through an area is involved:
/n3x°-ta'?/ '(go) by way of', e.g. /nax 0 -ta'? w 5-x° t-ta'i?/ 'go (by) that way'
(also: /na'mP^C-x"" n3x°-ta'? t-ta'i?/); /na'mP^C-x 0 n3x°-ta'? t-ta^staPa'n/
'go by way of North Vancouver'.

of others: /naxSmii'u-aPn/ 'cheek' (cf. the suff. /-a?n/ 'id.'), /nax^mii'i^aXan/ 'side'
(cf. /-aXan/ 'id.'), /n3x0-?a'c-a5/ 'palm of hand /-a5/', /nax°-?a,c-Sn/ 'sole of foot /-§n/',
/nax^Pa^c'-C/ 'spine' (cf. /-£/ 'back').
172. In the expressions 'my one/other eye', etc., formed with the root /?in(a)/ (see 208),
the prefix /nax°-/ is used in the case of such parts of the body as are part of or
imbedded in a larger whole; it is absent in the case of parts that stick out:
/ti w n-STn3x°-?in 2 a'ius/ 'my one (other) eye',/tiwn-STn3x°-?iln*us/ 'my one (other) cheek',
/tiwn-STn3x°-?in2a'Xa?n/ 'my one (other) side',
/tiwn-STn3x°-?in2ai?a'm?it/ 'my one (other) shoulder'.
Compare:
/ti w n-s-?i'n 2 a6/ 'my one (other) hand',
/ti^n-s-Pin'a'iPaPn/ 'my one (other) ear',
/ti w n-s-?i'na-qa/ 'my one (other) leg',
/ti w n-s-?i l na 2 q°a/ 'my one (other) head' (111:29, 30, said by a twoheaded monster).
173. The prefix-combination /nax0-s-/ gives nomina agentis: /n3x°-s-X3'iX/ 'warrior'
(cf. /XajX/ 'war'), /n3x°-s-?u'?X°-im?/ 'carver' (cf. /PuX°-tn/ 'knife', /Pu^-im?/,
red. /Pu'-PX'Mm?/ 'carve'), /nax°-s-?i'Xn/ 'eater' (cf. /PiXn/ 'eat; itr.'). The word
/nax°-s-au?ilc-i/ was recorded with the meaning 'fast work' (see Dictionary). The
combination occurs also in the verb /n3x0-s»n3'-n?p/ 'follow closely on a trail'.
174. The prefix /nax0-/ occurs with a number of stems containing somatic suffixes to
form bahuvrihi complexes 'sad-faced', 'bald-headed', etc. Before consonants proper
the alternant /n-/ appears: /n3X°-(h)i-a'ius/ 'big-eyed' (cf. /hii1, hi-/ 'big', suff. /-aius/NON-PERSONAL AFFIXATION115'eye'), /nax°-(h)ii'-qs/ 'big-nosed' (/-qs/ 'nose'),
'sad-faced' (/-us/
'face'), /n9X°-y3l£-u3£-qs/ 'broad-, flat-nosed'. The alternant /n-/ in: /n-c'i'-cV-us/
'sad-faced' (cf. /c'sx 0 / 'rotten'?), /n-cVjs-us/ 'crazy-faced', /n-sa'u?-us/ 'skinny',
lit. 'bone-faced', /n-q'i'l-us/ 'smart, clever', /n-c'a'q-iPaq 0 / 'bald' (suff. /-iPaq0/ 'top of
head'), /n-X°u'c'-£/ 'with bruised back' (cf. /X°uc7 'be bruised', suff. /-5/ 'back').
No prefix was recorded in /psX-c/ 'thick-lipped' /Vaqt-X'a'qt-sn/ 'long-legged' etc.
175. /nax°-/ occurs furthermore in a number of lexical items in which a local element
of meaning is more or less clearly discernible: /nax 0 -(h)iu-qs-a'n/ 'stick onto someone's nose' (cf. /hiu/ 'front', or possibly /hiu-q-/ 'push', /-q-qs/ 'merging to /-qs-/,
see 47),/n3X°-iq > -u l s-n/ 'sharpen (a knife)' (cf. /ja'q'-an/ 'sharpen; tr.'), /nax%n3u?i'ys-tn/ 'container, trunk' (cf. /na'uP-n/ 'put in; tr.'), /n3x°»ni'u2it/ 'teach, instruct',
/nax'Ma'm-aj/ 'bottle' (cf. /lam/ 'alcoholic beverage'), /nax°-?i-?ali2uX/ 'be aboard'
(cf. A/?ai 'inside', /-uX,/ 'canoe'), /nax°-ua l -u?s/ 'sit in the back of the room (away from
the fire)' (cf. /ua'S-an?/ 'remove from the fire'), /nax^ja'mP-tn/ 'belt', /n3x0-ii'?uX-tn/
'fireplace' (cf. /ji'Pu%l 'fire', suff. /-tn/ 'implement'), /n3x°-iuk°-a l ?min/ 'belonging to
a stingy person' (the exact meaning is probably 'treasure', 'hoard'; cf. /Pas-iu'Pk0/
'stingy').
With /n-/ before cons, proper: /n-XVs-Sn/ 'marrow' (cf. /X°3s/ 'fat', suff. /-§n/ 'leg'),
/(n-)qap\ (n-)qp'3t/ 'close; itr. and tr.', /n-X°il?-c/ 'be open' (cf. /X°il?/ 'come off',
suff. /-c/ 'mouth'), /n-qX-am?/ 'hold much, be able to contain a lot' (cf. /qsX/ 'much'),
/n-q°i'?s-tn/ 'cooking pot' (cf. /q°i?s-a'n/ 'boil; tr.'), /n-q'aX/ 'be in the way, in front',
/(n^q'i's-in/ 'tie up, knot together; knot (noun)' (cf. /q'is/ 'be tied, knotted'),
/n-q'a'-q'aj^q/ 'sit on a chair' (cf. V q ' a i 'be high up'), /(n-Jq'a'j-c-iPaq 0 / 'top of head',
/n-q^i'-q^l-us/ 'stick for holding salmon above the fire' (cf. v V ® ! 'ripe, cooked,
done', suff. /-us/ 'stick, pole'). Exceptionally /n-/ before /h/ in /n-ham?/ [naeh-]
'return home'.
176. In a few cases forms without prefix, with /n-/ and (nominalized) /s-n-/ occur
side by side: /q°u'?us, n-q°u'?us, s-n-q 0 u'?us/ 'tear', /cq°u'?ctn, n-cq°u'?ctn,
s-n-cq°u'?ctn/ 'pipe'; only zero- and /s-n-/ forms were recorded of /ta'q°tn, s-n-ta'q°tn/
'bucket'. The same combination /sn/, but without alternatives, occurs in /sn3x°i'X/
'canoe' and in the proper name /snX-a'lia/ (name of Mrs. IJ). In the first of these
words the /n/ is treated as part of the stem, cf. the reduplicated plural /s-n3x0»n3x°i l Xj
and the diminutive reduplication /s-ni^nix°iA,/; that this is the result of a secondary
coalescing appears from the existence of a suffix /-ax°iX/ 'container, canoe' (see 186:18).
The name /snXa'Ua/ probably contains the element /-Xal-j 'food, livelihood' (see 186:8).
177. In a number of cases no shade of meaning can be ascribed to /nax""-, n-/; in
several of these there are alternative forms without prefix:/n3x°Tm3c > tn?a l lqp/'a lie'
(with /-m/: 'to lie'), /n3x°»lil-l?q/ 'cheap', /nax^Pa'i?/ 'change; itr.', /n3x°-u3 l u.^a l nm/
'be surprised', /n3x°-ua'niu?n/ 'get tired waiting'. Cases with/n-/: /n-ta'WSis/ 'hammer',116MORPHOLOGY/n-ta'lq-t/ 'answer; tr.', /(n-)t3?a'u?-n/ 'expect', /(n-)£Ji'P-tn/ 'rattle', /(n-)s3'l-us/ 'spin

/n-s-?i/ 'loud', /(n-)s-uul2uu/ 'cougar', /(n-)s-(h)u'-hupit/ 'rabbit', /(n-)s-Xal2Xm/
'pigeon' (cf. /Xah-m/ 'cry'), /(n-)s-?a£.5a'uam/ 'conger eel', /(n-)s-m3lq>°a1?/ 'crane'.
Note that the latter five animal names all contain /-s-/; these words were probably
originally nomina agentis (see 173).
The Prefix /tx0-/
178. The prefix /tx°-/ indicates direction (a) with verbs of motion and (b) with stems
referring to the goal or effect of a motion or change. The prefix may be compared to
English "" a - "" in prepositions (along, above, about) and adverbs (afire, awash, adrift)
where these are used in combination with verbs of motion or change.
Examples (a) with verbs of motion: /tx°»nam?/ 'go, move along', as a relatorverb (219) 'with a view to, for (something desired), against (something disliked)',
also used as comparison-word '...er than'; reduplicated /tx°TnaLnam?/ 'be gone',
as a relator-verb'toward, in the direction of'; /tx0-(h3)m?i', tx°»m?i/ '(come) hither
to'; /tx0-5a'-n-m/ 'go where?' (see 211); /tx^t'ax0/ 'move out of', /tx°-&>Xq7 'move
through'.
Examples (b) with verbs referring to the result of a motion or change: /tx°-q'ai/
'(go) on top of, onto' (cf. /q'ai/ 'be on top'), /tx^x^si 1 ?/ '(go) between' (cf. /x^Si 1 ?/
'be between'), /tx°-iuty '(land) into the fire' (cf. /juX/ 'burn'), /tx°-palq°/ 'fall on one's
knees' (cf. /plq0-a'm/ 'kneel'), etc. Note particularly /tx°-(h)ui/ 'be all that remains',
'be left over' (cf. /hui/ 'be finished'), /tx°-(h)au/ 'be no longer the case, no more'
(cf. /hau/ 'be not the case', 'not', 'no').
In a few cases /tx°-/refers to a subject of discussion: /tx°-t3'-ta/ 'discuss', /tx°-?i'nat/
'be about what?' (said about speech).
In /tx°-n632a'm?/ 'be how (much)?' (see 210) the directional sense of /tx°-/ is
practically lost, but cf. the various uses of English ""up to"".
In principle, /tx°-/ can be added to any stem, the combination meaning 'achieve
the state of ...'. A person who has lost much weight can say /in^mn^tx^a'u?/
'I'm all bone /5au?/ now'. All cases recorded are found in the Dictionary under /tx0-/Other Prefixes
179:1. /m-/ (formative) can be isolated in /s-m*us/ 'head' (cf. suff. /-us/ 'face'); the
glottalization may be junctural but can also go back to */?am/. An initial /m-/ is
found in a number of words referring to parts of the body: /ma'qsn/ 'nose' (cf. suff.
/-qs/ 'nose'), which may contain /m-/ by itself but can also go back to */maq-qs-n/,
cf. the next example: /maq-allx°caX/ 'tongue'; /s-mac'-a'l-qn/ 'brain'; /ma'sn/ 'gall';
/m3'X°-ia/ 'navel' (cf. also /s-ma^-i'us/ 'smallpox', possibly from a \/ni3X0 'dimple,
mark'); /mii'u-/ 'side' (orig. meaning probably somatic).","[113, 114, 115, 116]"
"QUESTIONS OF WORD-PHONOLOGY55(5) Frequently in the type /C1A1-C1A1Ca/ (see 154): /p'a-p'a'iPaq-n/ 'cure; tr.'
(/p > a l iaq-n/),/k°ai-k°ai?l/'to dawn' (/s-k°ail/ 'day'), /?3s-k0al-k°aj?/ 'hidden' (/k°aj/
'hide'), /hi'-hil2it/ 'roll; tr.' (/hi'l-it/), /?i'-?i m ? a g/ 'walk' (/Pi'maS/), /?u'-?um?at/ 'be
lazy' (/Pu'mat/), /?u'-?um?i£/ 'move upstream' (/tx0-?u'mi5/ lid.'). No glottalization
in a minority of the cases where Simplicia were also recorded, e.g. in /t'a'-t'ajaq'/ 'be
angry', /Pa'-Pa^nax°/ 'be alive' (these may well be rapid-speech forms) and in a few
petrified cases, e.g. /q'a'-q'au/ 'skate', /s-na-na'^max°/ 'Nanaimo' (geogr.).
(6) Occasionally in other types, e.g. in /k°a'i*k°ai/ 'play hide and seek' (/k°ai/
'hide'), /sa'l'sl-tn/ 'implement for spinning thread' (/n-sa'l-us/ 'spin thread'),
/s-X.aLXn2ai/ 'female' (/s-Xa'n-aj?/ 'woman').
72. Suffixal Glottalization.— The transitivizer /-Vn/ and the intransitivizer /-Vm/ have
glottalized alternants /-Vn?, -Vm?/. The choice between these alternants depends on
the stem to which they are added, cf. on the one hand /k°a'i-an/ 'hide; tr.', /ii'k >0 -in/
'munch; tr.', /mu'j-un/ 'soak; tr.' and on the other hand /q'a'i-an?/ 'put high up; tr.',
/x0i'k°-in?/ 'brush; tr.', /c'u'i-un?/ 'peel; tr.'; with stressed suffix /q'lq'-a'n/ 'wind
around; tr.' (cf. /q'alq'/ 'be wound around') versus /jaX'q'-a'n?/ 'paint, rub; tr.'
(cf. /¿a'Vq'-tn/ 'paint (noun)'; implement-suff. /-tn/). In the case of ad hoc combinations of roots with lexical suffixes, the choice of alternant in the (in)transitivizer is
determined by the suffix, e.g. /p'iP-qs-a'n, p'iP-qs-a'm/ 'grab someone by the nose',
'grab one's nose', /siP-qs-a'm/ 'wipe one's nose', /q°a-qs-aln/ 'perforate someone's
nose', etc. versus /p>i?-q°-aln?, -a'm?/ 'grab someone by the head', 'grab one's head',
/tmX,-q°-alm?/ 'paint one's hair'.
Suffixes requiring the glottalized alternants are /-c/ 'mouth', /-5q/ 'hip', /-5n/ 'foot,
leg', /-q/ 'behind', /-q 0 / 'head' (in a few words plain alternants were recorded, undoubtedly rapid-speech forms). The plain form is required by /-qs/ 'nose' (no
exceptions).
73. Conclusion.— The material quoted in the preceding sections shows that glottalization is definitely characteristic of certain morphological formations as such. On the
other hand, there is not a single case of glottalization in the whole category of the
reduplicated plural, and morphemic glottalization is lost in the unstressed syllable
of these forms, cf. /lam?, lmrla'm?/ 'house, houses', /s-manPa'X, s-mnrmanPa'V
'person(s) of high class', /s-tau?x°X, s-tu-ta'y?x°X,/ 'children', /man?, ma'nPrmn/
'offspring', /s-Xan?, s-Xa'nP-xn/ 'leg'. This may be regarded as a regularizaron of a
tendency to drop /?/ in unstressed syllables, cf. /?3s-k°u'i?c/ 'joking, talking funny' vs.
/k°ui-k°uic-alm/ 'joke, talk funny', /Pas-iu'Pk0/ 'stingy' vs. /nax°-iuk°-al?min/ 'treasure'
/Xa'mPx0/ 'rain' vs. /XmxSni't-m/ 'be caught by rain', /ó'i'Px0/ 'dry' ví. /£'ix°-i'?/ 'get
dry', /iicq-a'n?/ or /Xi'cq-n/ 'fell (tree)', but in cases other than the red. plur. there
are exceptions, e.g. the glottalization in /n-q0i'?s-tn/ 'cooking pot' is preserved in
/q°i?s-a'n/ 'boil; tr.' (as opposed to /ó'ix^a'n?/ 'to dry; tr.' besides /ó'i'Px0/).
In several cases where glottalization is absent it is probable that reduced forms —56PHONOLOGYor at least free variants of glottalized ones — were recorded. For instance, if of /q°ah/
'be pierced' and /k°aj/ 'hide' glottalized forms were recorded in /?as-q°3l-q°a?/
'perforated', /?as-k°a'-k°ai?/ 'hidden', it is probable that /Pas-q'a'-q'i/ 'being on top'
is a reduction of ""/Pas-q'a'-q'ai?/ (see 36). On the other hand, I cannot explain the
presence of glottalization in a reduplication like /mi 2 ma'i?/ 'lose one's way' besides
/majj 'forget', /ma^nax 0 / 'have forgotten'. — If in /min?.min?u'lX/ (recorded
[me n ?men?o' 'R]) 'young of animal' glottalization is present before the stressed
syllable (a position where it is particularly subject to elimination), this must be due
to the fact that it is morphemic (cf. /man?/ 'offspring'), but morphemic glottalization
is often lost, and regularly so in the reduplicated plural (see above); I write /min?»
minP-u'lX/, though the 2nd instance of/?/ could also be junctural. — In/n-XatXi'tPajus/
'far-sighted' (cf. /Xa'ta/ 'far', /-ai?us, -ajus/ 'eye') there is a unique occurrence of /?/
at the border between a stem ending in a cons, proper and a vocalic suffix; possibly
the full form of the simplex is */ia'ta?/, here reduced to /tot?-/ (cf. also /£m?a'?/
'carry a load' and /£a'm?atn/ 'shoulder strap' (implement-suffix /-tn/), where stemfinal /-a?/, here preceded by /m?/, is reduced in a different way, resulting in an
unstressed occurrence of /a/). — The /n?/ in /?as-n?i'u?/ 'be inside' (Vniu?, nau?,
nu?) is also hard to account for; possibly /-n?iu/ goes back to */?ni'u?/, reduplicated
*/?3-?ni'\i?/ >/?n?i'u?/, as in /Pmu't/ 'assume a sitting position', red. /?m?u't/ <
*/?a-?mu't/ 'sit; be at home'. The initial /?/ of */?n?i'u?/ could then be lost after
/?as-/, see 44.
In this way, the occurrence of /?/ leaves a number of problems which require a
special investigation.
B. THE OCCURRENCE OF /a/74. The overwhelming majority of the occurrences of /a/ are predictable on the basis
of the following rules:
(1) In the absence of a full vowel, a morpheme /CVC/ has the form /CC/ when
unstressed and preceded or followed by a vowel; otherwise it has the form /CaC/.
(2) In the absence of a full vowel, a partial-reduplication syllable has the form /C x a-/.
(3) A morpheme-initial sonant is non-syllabic in the morphological environment
/...CVC + R(V)C.../ (phonemically /...CVC.R(V)C.../, cf. 39; note that /./ indicates
the absence of /a/) except if the stress falls ""between"" the constituents (phonemically
/...CVCa'RVC.../).
With regard to rule (1) account must be taken of the automatic alternations of
morphemes /Caj, Cau, Cah/ discussed in 14-19; in particular, the forms of these
morphemes corresponding to /CC/ can be /Ci, Cu, Ca/.
Examples with the zero-grades of Vt'ak >0 , t'ak>0 'dig', V t ' a q "" , t'aq' 0 'break',
Vt'aq', t'aq' 'across' (used in the numeral /t'a'q'-ad/ 'six', lit. 'across-hand', and
derivatives) and with -v/t>3* 'open':
(A) Without the conditions mentioned under (1): /t'a'q' 0 / 'break', /t'aq'^mi'n?/QUESTIONS OF WORD-PHONOLOGY57'broken-off half' (cf. rule 3), /s-t>alq>0-t'aq>o-s/ (geogr.), lit. 'cut up in chunks',
/t'aq'-t'a'q'-aC/ 'six (persons)', /t'a'X-t'aX-c/ 'have the mouth open'.
(B) Under the conditions of (1) / t V - i ' m ? / 'dig; act.-itr.', /t'q^-i'm?/ 'chop;
act.-itr.', /n-s-t'q'-i'us/ 'side of body', /t'X-a'iPus-m/ 'open one's eyes', /t'aX-t'X-a'iPus/
'have the eyes open' (2nd root-syllable), /Pas-t'a'-t'k'0/ 'pit, dugout' (cf. rule 2; an
unstressed reduplication-syllable in /ta-ts-i'P/ 'feel cold'), /Pas-t'a'-t'q'/ 'lying across'.
(C) Examples illustrating rule (3): /s-mnrma'nit/ 'mountains', /mUmi'li?/ 'get
mixed up', /PnTma'n?/ 'my /?n-/ child'; the stress falls ""between"" constituents in
/q>cq°a'mn/ 'ax', cf. -vAfuq 0 , q>03q° 'beat, strike' and the unique constituent /-mn/.
75. If morpheme-borders are indicated, the examples given in the preceding section
could be unambiguously written without /a/: an automatic schwa is present between
consonants (a) under the stress, (b) in the environment / Q - Q / , and (c) in the environment l#CC#l (where # denotes absence of a vowel). The elimination of /a/ would
have the advantage that an automatic schwa between two morphemes would not
have to be assigned arbitrarily to either the preceding or the following one, cf.
/q>0q°-a'mn/ or /q>0q°a'-mn/ quoted above, and other cases such as /taia'uiX/ 'racecanoe' (/taiI 'race in canoe', /-uity 'container, canoe'), /qp'at/ 'close; tr.' (/qapV
'close; itr.', /-t/ transitivizer). The difference between the trans, derivatives of /qap'/
and of/q >0 al/ 'be done, ripe, etc.', viz. /qp'at/ vs. /q'°alt/ 'cook; tr.', could be treated
as a matter of stress: /CC'C/ vs. /C'CC/. Furthermore, a more elegant notation
would be achieved, e.g., in the case of prefixes such as /?n-/ 'my' and /Pas-/ (participial
prefix), which could be uniformly transcribed /PC-/.
Of the difficulties entailed by an elimination of /a/, some could be solved easily.
Prefixes with the shape /KK-/ are pronounced without schwa (the only instances
are /tx0-/ (directional) and /sx°-/ 'step (-relative)'), and the syllabic structure of a
word like /sx°Tman/ 'stepfather' differs from that of /saq'rmi'n/ 'cuttings, waste wood',
where /saq'/ is a root CVC. The distinction could be expressed either by using a
special symbol for the border between prefix and stem, or by regarding these prefixes
as bimorphemic (besides /tx°-/ there is /nax°-/ (locational), and /sx0-/ can be said to
contain the nominalizer /s-[), and by stating a rule for the pronunciation of initial
/C-C-C.../. — It would be necessary to distinguish, in the notation, reduplicative
formations from ""accidental"" sequences / Q - Q . . . / , cf. /ta-tauP-i'P/ 'become bright'
vs. /t-ta'i?/ 'that one (relative case)'. A sophisticated morphophonemic notation would
go a long way towards eliminating the non-automatic occurrences of /a/, while an
indication of immediate constituents would largely remove the need for the symbol /./.
There are certain factors, however, which stand in the way of an elimination of /a/
and /./ from the notation. In the first place, /a/ was sometimes recorded in unstressed
syllables of longer, to me unanalyzable units, e.g. /s-Pac'a'mPas/ 'women's shoulder
blanket'. It was even recorded in a few cases which violate rule (1) in 74, e.g. /Xa'-Xa5/
'remember', /qa'-qaC/ 'be increasing (ab. moon)'. Very probably, either incidental
svarabhakti-vowels or reduced full vowels are involved here; it is also possible that58PHONOLOGYthe stress was misrecorded. In the second place, complex statements would be
necessary to distinguish, for instance, the 1st pers. sing, object suffix /-m§/ from the
in some words habitually reduced form of the formative /-mi§, -ma3/. I also hesitate
to remove the schwa from the notation in such cases as /q ,0 aj?q ,0 a 'iPaX/ 'shy, wild',
/-ai?aq°, -iPaq0/ 'top of head' (as compared to /?aj?X/ 'crab'), see 49, from /ta?a'u?n/
'expect', etc. (as compared to /tPa'X-i/ 'that (female) one (relative case)'), see 68, end,
from /Ca'mPatn/ 'shoulder strap', see 73, etc. On the other hand, the elimination of/a/
before unstressed /m, n, 1/ already necessitates the use of /./ in a few cases which
from a synchronic point of view are monomorphemic, e.g. in /s-t'l.mu'Pt/ 'old person',
/-X.n-I 'throat'; when /a/ is eliminated altogether, this number increases accordingly.
Nevertheless, the status of /a/ is not on a level with that of the full vowels. In more
than one respect, /a/ has the character of a juncture-feature rather than that of a
phoneme.","[54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"
"REDUPLICATION101147. Special cases of reduplicated plural forms:
/put-i'uPas/ 'oar', pi. /put-put-i'uPas/ with an exceptional full vowel in the reduplication-syllable (the root is borrowed from Engl, boat, so that the form is recent).
/si'?l/ 'grandparent' has pi. /sl-si'?l/; the sequence /i?l/ is treated as /AC2/ here.
/sau?t/ 'junior-line child', pi. /sa-sa'uPt/ (instead of expected */su-sa'u?t/, cf.
/s-tu-ta'u?x°X/ above). Etymologically, the simplex probably consists of /s-/ and
/?au?t/ 'behind, future', so that this plural is an innovation.
/k>0q°a'istn/ 'stick for smoothing wool', pi. /k>03-k>0q°alistn/. The simplex contains
the dissimilated zero-form of the root /q>0uq0-/ 'beat'; the plural is a reduction of
*/k'03q0-k>0q°-alistn/ (cf. /q°3X-q°Xa'i?/ above).
/s9q,0i'?tl, ?3q'°i '?tl/ 'siblings and cousins', pi. /sa'q^aq^iPtl/ < */s-?3iq>0-?3q>0i?tl/.
Irregular is only the stress on the first syllable.
/s-ui'?qa/ 'man' has pi. /s-i2ui'?qa/, probably < */s-ui^ui[?qa/ with dissimilative
loss of the first /y/.
/s-yi'-u?lus/ 'young man, youth' has pi. /s-ua'-uPlus/ (see 78).
/s-jaia's, s-iXa's/ '(big) rock' has besides its regular plural /s-jM-jaXa's/ an alternative
form /s-jaX-a'jXas/ [...XeiX...].
Cases with stem-initial /jj or /hi-/: /s-(h)i?a'm?/ 'chief' (see Dictionary under
Vham?), pi. /s-(h)i'i?am?/; /s-ja'i?/ 'friend', pi. /s-i'jai?/; /s-iul2iux°a/, pi. /s-ii?u'x°a/.
For all these cases see SO.
The plural of/s-mac'i'n?/ 'skunk' was given as /s-ma-mac'i'n?/, with an unexpected
partial instead of a total reduplication.
Other Cases of Total 11
148. The remaining cases of total reduplication (type II) concern for the most part
verbs. Sometimes the reduplicated forms refer to a repeated action, e.g. in /tak >0 W - S n I 'stumble along' (cf. Ai'k>0-3n/ 'stumble', /5Uk>0/ 'get hooked', /-§n/ 'foot,
leg'), /t>3x0-t>a'x°-an/ 'take out one by one'; sometimes a meaning 'all the time' or
'all over' is involved, e.g. /t'aq-t'a'qa?/ 'be bruised all over'; sometimes the reduplication is lexicalized, e.g. /mi'ma'i?/ 'lose one's way' (cf. /mai/ 'forget'). In a
number of cases reduplicated forms were recorded only in /Pas-/ derivatives (164 ff.),
e.g. /?3s-c>3x°-c>ilx7 'willing to help, helpful' (cf. /c'i 'x°-n/ 'help out of trouble').
There are also a few unmarked nouns, e.g. /t3q°-tu'q°/ 'red codfish'. We treat first
the derivatives of roots with full vowels (Ha) and then those of roots with /a/ (lib).
Total Ha:/QaCVQACy149. Total reduplications of vocalized roots include a number of color-designations
with root-vowel /i/: /p'aq^-p'i'q' 0 / 'yellow', A'as-Vi's/ 'green', /k°m-k°iim/ 'red',
/x°3k>°-x°ilk>7 'grey', /q'aX-q'i1*/ 'black'. Other quality designations-in /tac-ti'c/
'skinny', /tu-ta'u?/ 'bright', /(n-)§u-§a'u?us/ 'bony, skinny' (cf. /§au?/ 'bone', the only102MORPHOLOGYexample with a nominal root), /(n-)Xst-Xi 't2ajus/ 'sharp-eyed' (cf. /Xa'ta/ 'far'),
/X°35-X°al5-aius/ 'id.' (no simplex recorded).
Other verbs and /Pas-/ derivatives: /mUmi'lS'/ 'get mixed up', /mi2ma'i?/ 'get lost,
lose one's way', /mi-mu'j/ 'flood over', /t>3x°-tVx°-an/ 'take out one by one',
/t'aq-t'a 'qa?/ 'be bruised all over', /?3s-c>3x°-c'i 'x°/ 'willing to help, helpful', /naiSni '5im/
'speak, talk', /na^Tna'C'rnauPas/ 'be different from each other' (reciprocal suffix
/-nauPas/),/5i-5a'i2s/'follow, chase', /sm-Sa'm/ 'run aground', /X.ac'-X.u'c'/ 'be scabby,
itch'* /X3k>0-Xi'k>0-Sn/ 'stumble along', /laxMi'x0/ 'fall down', /k>03s-k>0a's/ 'burn',
/q'sc'-q'ac'-d-s-ta'namPut/ 'hug oneself, cross one's arms', /q53x°-qVx°-i?/ 'get very
callous', /q 0 l-q 0 a'luan/ 'think, plan', /?i-?a^s/ 'wait for; tr.', /?3s-(?)m-?ulm?at/
'lazy', /ia^-Ju'V 'burn, flame'.
Unmarked nouns: /t3q 0 -tu'q 0 / 'red codfish', /x°l-x°ali'tn/ 'Watt's Point' (place
where the white man /x 0 ali'tn/ first arrived). A unique case is presented by the
nominalized itr. derivative /s-mn»ma'nt-m/ 'rocky shore' (cf. /s-mant/ 'stone'). The
ethnic name /pl-pa'la/ 'Bella Bella' may be an accidental reduplication, cf. /p3'l-x°la/
'Bella Coola'.
150. Note — Reduplications of the types /Ci-CVj.../ and /Ci-CiV.../ < */Ci-CaiV.../
(e.g. /mi-mu'i, ci-ci fa5is/) could in themselves also be described as partial reduplications
of type IV (/Qi-QVjCa/, see 157); furthermore, the second of these examples is formally
identical with an exceptional stress-type of diminutive reduplication (see 159). In
several cases there are clear indications that we are dealing with total reduplications.
Such is the case in regular plurals like /Pi-Pa'¿is/ 'siblings of opposite sex' and in the
personal numeral /ci-ci'a£is/ 'five (persons)', which obviously represent the same
pattern as /k03p-k°u'pic/ 'elder brothers' and /5n-£a'nat/ 'three (persons)'. Note the
paradigmatic difference between the total red. /ci-ci'a£is/ and the partial red.
/ci'-ciPa'Sis/ 'five (animals)' (cf. /Xi'-XaPu'cn/ 'four (animals)', see 213), and that
between the total (plur.) red. /s-k>0i-k>0iu'c/ 'slaves' and the partial (dimin.) red.
/s-k>0il-k>0iuc/ 'domestic animal', lit. 'little slave' (cf. /li'*lam?/ 'little house', see 159).
The status of the remaining cases (/mUma'i, mi-mu'j, 6i-5a'i?s, ?i-?a'i?s/) is less
certain. They are classed as total reduplications because this type is much more
frequent than partial red. of type IV. Cf. also 152.
Total lib: /C1aCi!-C1(3)C2/
151. The large majority of this type are verbs and verb-derivatives. Suffixless forms
and forms with unstressed suffixes as a rule have the stress on the first syllable. If the
root ends in a sonant, glottalization appears at the border between stressed redupl.
syllable and root-syllable in ca. two thirds of the cases. We treat first the roots
ending in a cons, proper, and then those ending in a sonant.
Roots ending in a cons., stress on first syllable: /mo'kmaC-m/ 'move slowly (ab.
water)', /s-t'a'q^-t'aq^-s/ 'a place E of Horseshoe Bay' (lit. 'cut up in chunks',REDUPLICATION103Vt'aq' 0 , t'aq' 0 'be broken'), /t'a'X-t'aX-c/ 'have the mouth open' (cf. also /t'aX-t'Xa'i?us/ 'have the eyes open', /Pas-t'aX-t'X-a'ix0/ 'branchy'), /Pos-Ca'q-Caq/ 'dirty',
/k'VX-k 1 0 ^/ 'spill; itr.', /qs'p'-qp'-us/ 'face downward', /Xa'C-XaC/ 'remember',
/Pas-Pa'S-Pai/ 'stuttering'; here also belong the reduplicated plurals /s-cs'q-caq/
'trees', /sa^'^q^iPtl/ < */s-?3lq>0-?3q10i?tl/ 'siblings and cousins', and the numeral
/cVs-c'asI 'nine (persons)'. — Two equal stresses were recorded in /A-Vi 0 -^ 1 * 0 /

"E. AD-HOC NOMINALIZATIONS324. It is characteristic of the verb-forms in /k°i/-clauses that the nominalizer /s-/ is
added to a preceding clitic when one is present, e.g. /C-n^ua^Pasna't k°i w n-STna w ,
ua w c > ic > a l p'/ 'I work at night', lit. 'I am nocturnal in the matter of my being at work'.
There is a different category of cases where the nominalizer /s-/ is added to the verbstem, and where clitics precede this complex, e.g. /na w ui'lq >0 tcasuit q w sta'm-as
k°iv_,nav_,uas^n-s-c>ic>alp>/ 'they asked me what kind of work I was doing'. In this
case, /s-c'ic'a'p'/ can be taken as the noun 'work, job', so that the above sentence
may be rendered literally 'they asked me what it was, that which was being my work'.
Such a phrase of clitic(s) plus nominalized verb-form can take any article, e.g.
/x°i_na l 5 > k°3ci w na w ua s ^n-s-c > ic > a l p > / 'I am working on a different job now', lit.
'different now is that which is being my work'. However, unlike /s-c'ic'a'p'/, several
such nominalizations are found only in this type of complexes, so that the latter must
be regarded as constructions ad hoc, and not as combinations involving regular nouns.
Here follows a list of all cases of predicative clitic + /s-/-derivative that were
recorded, subdivided according to whether the verb-stem is (a) intransitive other
than passive, (b) transitive or (c) passive. Where non-nominalized personal forms of
the stems involved were recorded, these are quoted first in parentheses.

'I always find something'): /naw,n-s»m9lk°m/ 'I found it', /naw?3-STm3lk°m/ 'you
found it', /n w 3u w ,?3-STm3 l k°m/ 'did you find it (or acquire it some other way)?'.
/c'ah/ 'be hit' (personal verbal forms were recorded with suffixes only: /5-n w c > sh-u l s/
'I got hit in the face', /5-n w c , a'-q°j 'I bumped my head', etc.): /na^Pa'nfia
k°i^na^,?3-s-c > 3 l h/ 'where (on what part of the body) did you get hit?'.

"THE PREDICATE173254. The abovementioned peculiarity of isolated sentences VtN a , and also some other
features of Squamish syntax, can be explained on the basis of certain reflections on
the Squamish transitive predicate in general, for which purpose we introduce — in
this section only — the terms thème (what one speaks about) and propos (what one
says about it). The 3rd pers. finite form /na^ëVmPt-as/ 'he bit him' is identical
with the nominal form '(one) whom he bit' (see 134), so that it can be interpreted
as a nominal predicate '(it is) what he bit', cf. /sui'Pqa/ '(it is) a man'. Where S and
O are specified, e.g. in VtSO /na^ôVmPt-as ta w sq°ma'i? ta^sui'Pa/ 'the dog bit
the man', the phrase VtS is the propos '(it is) what it, the dog, bit', and O 'the man' is
the thème to this propos, so that the whole sentence can be rendered '(it is) what the
dog bit, the man' = 'the man is what (or: whom) the dog bit'. In this conception of
the Squamish VtSO sentence the fact that S and O are both in the absolutive case
finds a satisfactory explanation: both are ""subjects"" to a ""predicate"". Furthermore,
if /na^ô'a'mPtas ta w sq°ma l j[?/ is interpreted as 'he bit the dog' ( = 'it is what he bit,
the dog') and not as 'the dog bit him' ( = 'it is what it, the dog, bit'), then this is
because such an isolated sentence is taken as a complete whole thème-propos (VtO)
and not as a mere propos (VtS). In the same way, the English sentence ""he was
helping the boy"", produced in isolation with a strong stress on ""helping"", will be
taken as an instance of the construction SVO, though the same intonation-pattern
can also be used for ""he was helping (us, them), the boy"".
255. The trans, finite forms which lack a subject-suffix, i.e. those with 1st or 2nd pers.
subject (see 131) are identical with the subject-centered forms of the nominal
paradigm (see 130) except for the clitics, e.g. /ô-x° w 5'a , yat-c/ 'you help me' and
/na^C'a'uat-c/ '(one) who helps me'; obviously, these finite forms can be interpreted
as nominal: 'you are (one) who helps me'. The object-centered trans, nominal form
/na w ta'q°an-t-as/ 'which he drank' differs from the subject-centered one /na w ta'q°an/
'who drank it' (see 130) in that it has the subject-suffix /-as/, before which the trans,
suffix /-an/ is extended with /-t-/ (see 82). If we translate /na w ta'q°an/ as 'which is
characterized by transitive drinking', then /na^ta'q°antas/ can be analyzed as going
back to */na N ^ta'q°an t-?as/ 'which is characterized by trans, drinking by /t-/ him
/Pas/' (relative case prefix + 3rd pers. clitic). This is the type of construction
commonly referred to as ""ergative"", cf. English ""he (nom.) is a standee"" and ""he
(nom.) is his (obi.) advisee"". Though this construction must have existed at least in
3rd pers. forms with a pronominal subject, it is no longer a feature of Squamish: a
finite form like /na w ô > a'uat-c-as/ 'he helps me', as compared to the nominal form
/na^ô'a'uat-c/ '(one) who helps me' does not allow an ergative interpretation (nor
can it be described as nominal). The ergative survives only in the 3rd pers. objectcentered nominal forms of trans, verbs, necessitating the use of the phrase 'subject of
itr. or object of tr. verb' in the description of phrases with adjuncts (see 259, 260 ;
cf. also 273).","[172, 173]"
"XVIII
RELATOR-VERBS219. There are a number of verbs which imply a complement in the relative case (if
expressed). Semantically, these verbs correspond to English prepositions. The
complement is not always expressed explicitly: it may be absent where context or
situation leave no room for doubt (in the same way as in English ""he went along
with X"" can be replaced by ""he went along"" when X's going somewhere has just
been mentioned).
220. The following verbs belong to this category:
/na?/ 'be at, be there': / n a w y a _ n a ' ? X-'a^Pa'lqsn/ 'he is (staying, living) at Point
Grey', /na__na'? X'a^Pa'lqsn/ 'it is (located, situated) at Point Grey', / n a w u a _
?m?u't na1? t-ta w tmi'x7 'he is sitting, (being) on the ground'. The use of /na?/
approaches that of a true preposition in subjectless cases like /na1? t-k°iwk°3k°iln?/
'in old times, long ago' (1:1). Note the idiomatic use in /C-n^ya^c'icVp' na1?
t-ta w sui'?qa/ 'I am working for the man', in the same way/na1? X > a w na'u/ 'for you'.
/ti-na1?/ 'be from': /tina'? w 5-n X,'aw?3'lqsn/ 'I am from Point Grey', /5-n^,si'Xa?n
tina1? X,'awPilta/ 'I bought it from Peter', /£-n w c'u'?n ta w c'i'stn tina1?
t-ta w s?ai?a'n?/ 'I pulled the nail out of the wall'.
/nam?/ '(go) to' (also used as a plain verb meaning 'to go'): /C-n^Ca'Sn na'm?
t-k°a_sma'nit/ 'I sent him (so as to go) to the mountain', /?n-s»na w mn w q'a l nacut
na'm? t-tawn-sn3x°i'X,/ 'then I returned to my canoe' (V: 16).
/tim?a'/ '(be) as, like, according to': /na^timPa 1 t-k°9'ci/ 'it was so', 'it was like that'
(without pointing gesture), /timPa' t-ta'j?/ 'like that!' (with a pointing gesture accompanying the demonstrative /tai?/), /s-s N _mn w ta'q°-uit tim?a' t-k°3ci w na w sPusu'nPtm-s-yit/ 'then they drank /taq°/ as they had been shown /?usun?/ (to do)'
(IV:29). Without complement: /na w tim?a'/ 'it is true', lit. 'it is accordingly',
/hiu'jPm timPa1/ 'it is allright /hiu'jPm/ that way'. Special types of use: /tim?a'
q^Pas^cu't/ 'as if /q/ he /?as/ said', see 296; /timPa1wmaX, ua w ,nr^^,na w cu't/
'that's why /ya...X/ I /n-/ said', see 307. In one example /timPa1/ is preceded by an154MORPHOLOGYarticle /ha'u q w u _ ? a x ° w c > i c ' a l p ' t-k 0 a w tim?a'/ 'don't work like that!' ('the way
you were doing'). — The word allows a causative derivation: /timPa'-s^S-x"" t-ti1/
'do it like this!' (showing how), lit. 'cause it to be according to this!'
A number of /Pas-/ derivatives (164ff.) belong to the relator-category: /Pas-q's-q^u1?/
'(be together) with', e.g. /5-n w ?3sq , 3q'°u l ? X'a.JTa'm/'I am with Tom'; /PasnPi'u?/
'be inside', e.g./na^PasnPi'u? t-ta^k^a'x^P/ 'it's inside the box'; /Pasq'a'q'i/ 'be on
top of', e.g. /na w ua w ?3sq > a l q > i t-ta w lata'm/ 'it is (sitting) on the table' (said about
a cat, hence / n a w u a ^ / , see 228)\ /Past'a't'qV 'be across', e.g. /na^Past'a't'q'
t-ta w §ua'V 'it is (lying) across the road' (said about a tree); /(?3)s-ti'-ta?/ (recorded
/st-/) '(be) on'.
Of the /nax°-/ and /tx°-/ derivatives (168-178) many belong to the relator-category:
/n3x°ta'?, nax^i1?, nax^i't, tx°.namP, tx°.m?i, tx°taP, tx°tiP, tx°.nuP, txTax 0 ,
tx°5aXq°/, etc. For examples of use see Dictionary.
/-iu?iX,/-derivatives (see 186:39), e.g. /na^ua^b's-iuiX, ta^pu'S t-ta^lata'm/ 'the
cat is under the table'.","[152, 153, 154]"
"233. The clitic /X.k°un/ expresses that the speaker considers the contents of his statement possible or even probable: / n a ' P _ X k ° u n k ° w S i a ' X P i ^ m i ^ h i P a ' m ? / 'maybe
he'll soon get here', / k ° u k c i l n ? w X k ° u n ?8STli'-l?x°-as/ 'it could have been lying (there)
for a long time', /ni'X w Xk°u'n-uit n a w h u ' i ? s / 'it could have been them that ate it',
/ h a ' 9 w X k ° u n / 'that's not so', 'it can't be' (disbelief), / n a ' P ^ \ k ° u n / 'it could be',
'maybe', /5ia'X w Xk°un/ 'pretty soon'. Note the use in /ha'u q ^ u ^ P a n ^ X q ' i ' P s t - a n
q w ? a s w A , k ° u n w k > ° i l n / ' I don't know how many (German 'wieviele wohl')'.
234. The directional clitics /nam(?)/ 'go', /m(?)i/ 'come' and /x°i/ 'appear' are
etymologically identical with the full verbs /nam?, (ha)mPi', x°ajj; the first two often
lose their /?/ when used as clitics. The clitics /nam, mi/ in many cases correspond to
English 'go' and 'come' in such expressions as 'I'll go and get it', 'I'm going to do it',
'come have a look', 'come on, do it', etc.; in other cases they function as more general
direction-indicators comparable to German 'hin' and 'her(vor)\ The clitic /x°i/,
recorded in a few examples only, indicates that something is the result of a change,
that a new state o f affairs has set in. Examples: / n a m w 6 - x ° w ? u ' i s , m i w 5 - x ° w P u ' i s /
'go inside!', 'come in!' (/Pu'js/ 'enter a house'), / n a m - k a w ? m u ' t / 'sit down!' (said162MORPHOLOGYto a person standing), /mi-ka^Pmu't/ 'get up' (said to a person who is lying down;
/Pmu'tI by itself means 'assume a sitting position'), /nam w C-n w huj|a 1 ?/ 'I'm going
away' (/huja1?/ 'leave, depart'), /nam_?u w £-x°, w c > ic > a l p > k 0 a'ilas/ 'are you going
to work tomorrow?', /mi w 5-x° w sa l t-5it-c/ 'give it to me!', /mi_sui'?qa/ 'become a
man', /mi^_Sa'm/ 'emerge from the water', /5-n_mi^,na l 6 > i/ 'my expression
changed', / 5 - n ^ x ° i ^ u a _ n a l ? Va w ?a l lqsn/ 'I live now on Point Grey', / y a ' ? w t
sus'Pu-s-t-m Pi'ta, n a w m a ^ w x ° i w u a w T a l m - s - t - m / 'he used / y a ? ^ t / to be called
Peter, but now he is called Tom', lit.'... caused to be Tom', /x°i w na'5 > k ^ c i ^ n a ^
ua^n-s-c'ic'a'p'/ 'I'm working on a different job now', lit. 'different (is) what is
being my /n-/ work'.
See Syntax 334.
235. The clitic /maX,/ lends a certain emphasis to a preceding element. It represents a
fusion of the three clitics */mn w ua w X,/ 'just-continue-which' (see 55:5). Semantically, it can be compared to English 'now' when this word points to circumstance
rather than to time, e.g. in 'what is (was) that, now?', 'did he, now?'. Examples:
/hujia l ? w £-n w ma>./ 'I'm going, now', 'well, I'm going' (/huia1?/ 'leave, depart'),
/sta'm w (m)ak ta'i?/ 'what's that, now?', / c ' i c V p ^ C - n ^ m a t y 'I'm going to work,
now', /Xq > i l ?s^.?u v _ / £-x° w ma>, k°i w s-ua w ?i l ?sun/ 'do you know how to paddle?'
(cf. German 'weisst du wohl, wie ...?'), /hi l n?^?u w maA. k 0 i w (?3-)s-ua w ?i'/ 'are
you going to stay here long?', lit. 'long whether /?u/ your being here /Pi/?',
/na w ci'qin?t-as. — n w a ' u ? — n w a'y w maX,? — na1?!/ 'He stabbed him. — Did
he? — Did he really? — He did!'.
See Syntax 340.
236. Of the clitic /?a/, which apparently lends a certain emphasis to a preceding
element, only two examples were recorded: /hu'i w £-x° w ?a/ 'thank you!', lit. 'you
are ready /hui/', and / h a ' u w ? a / 'it's nothing!' (1:16). Note that both examples occur
in direct forms of address. The clitic may involve a strong appeal to the addressee
and may have an etymological relation to the 2nd pers. possessive prefix /?a-/.
237. The clitic /mn/ represents the weak form of/man/ in /mani'V '(he) himself' and
/mani'maty '(we) ourselves' ( < */manwnilmaX-). Where it can be translated at all,
it corresponds to English 'just' in several senses, e.g. /ha'u q w u ^ ? a x ° ^ , c ' a l n ,
m n ^ X a ' q ^ a n ^ i - x 0 / 'don't punch /c'an/ him, just slap /Xa'q>0an/ him'; /mn w ia'X,
n-STnawX>i'q/ 'I've just arrived' versus Ha'X, n-STna w m?i' (t-)ti'ua/'then I came here';
/mn^?ii?X° n-s-W?/ 'I like them all' ('I like just all of them'), / m n _ « q / 'Gust)
always'. If in the latter two examples the translation 'just' sounds somewhat forced,
in the overwhelming majority of cases it does not fit at all, and /mn/ must remain
untranslated. In running texts, almost every sentence begins with / s - s w m n w . . . /
'then he ...', / ? n - s r n a w m n w . . . / 'then I . . . ' (see 342f.), but 'then' is not a translation
of /mn/, the latter not being a deictic or identificatory morpheme (such a morphemePREDICATIVE CLITICS AND SUFFIXES163can be added: /ni'X s-s w mn N _.huia'?-uit/ '(it was) then (that) they departed'). When
the element 'then' is stressed ('right then'), /s-s w mn/ is replaced by /s-s^mani'X./
'then right away', cf. /mani 'X/ 'self' (204); the meaning of /mn/ is therefore best
labeled ""determinative"" or ""limitative"". There are cases where phrases with and
without /mn/ are used indiscriminately; at least, I have not been able to detect any
difference in meaning: /C-x° w .(mn v _ / )ua w ?3sta l tX 0 / 'you are right', /(mn w )k >0 i'n/
'few'.
The clitic /mn/ regularly accompanies verbs meaning 'to continue': / m n ^ y a ^ u /
'continue, carry on', /mn_X > a l i/ 'be as previously, do something still, yet'; in other
cases /mn/ itself adds the meaning-element 'continue' to a complex: /mn_?i'/ 'stay
here', /m(n) w na'?/, also /mn?a'?/ 'stay there' (cf. /?i, na?/ 'be here, be there'),
/mnw ? i ' s / 'keep here', lit. 'cause to remain here'; with partially reduplicated (durative)
stems: /m(n) w na l -nam-ka/ 'go on walking!', /mn w ?m?u't-ka/ 'remain seated!'
( < */?3-?mu't/). It seems possible that the semantic element 'continue', 'remain'
results from a basic meaning 'just, only' ('just do what you are doing' = 'don't start
doing something else' = 'continue as previously').
See Syntax 341-348, 356.
238. The clitic /ja/, often reduced to /ji, i/, is probably identical with stressed /¿a'/ in
/¿a'X/ 'then, thereupon', /mn_.ia'X/ '(have) just (done something)', /ja'mn/ 'even
though, even if'. It may represent a full form of /Pi/ 'here' (cf. also the 3rd pers. pi.
demonstrative /?i'a*uit/ 202; see also Dictionary s.v. /q'aq'iPa's/). The clitic occurs,
often (perhaps always) facultatively, in one type of negative forms: /ha'u
q w ?an w (ia) w k'°a l 5»n3x 0 / 'I didn't see it', /ha'u q_?as_,(ia^)?i'A.n/ 'he didn't
eat', /ha'u q w ? a n ^ i a w c i ' x ° / 'I didn't get (reach) there', /ha'u q x _?as w j[a w ?i'nat/
'he didn't say anything' (111:13), /ha'u q ^ P a s ^ i a ^ p ' a ' j a q n t - a s / 'he didn't cure
them' (111:57). I have only one example in a positive sentence: /k'VC-t-ka
? i w i a w k G w h a m ? i ' - y i t / 'look, they're coming'.
239. The imperative suffix /-ka/ is used for positive commands or requests only. Its
use is not obligatory: it can be absent or be replaced by the 2nd pers. complexes
/5-x°, 6-a(ia)p/. In my material, /-ka/ is practically limited to transitive verbs and to
the directional clitics /nam(P), m(?)i/. When a command is addressed to more than
one person, the plural suffix is added: /-ka 2 uit/. The trans, suffixes /-s/ and /-(V)n/
are not extended with /-t-/ before the imperative-suffix (see 82). Examples: /Ca 'yat-ka/
'help him!' (also /5'a'yat, 5 > a l yat w fi-x°/), /eVuat-c-ka/ 'help me /-c/!\ /ffa'yatu'muX-ka/ 'help us /-umuty!', /S'a'uat-c-ka'uit/ 'help (pi.) me!', /ti'u?iX.n-ka*yit/
'protect (pi.) him!', /mi'k>0in-cut-ka/ 'wash yourself!', /mi-ka^p'si'?/ 'come to
shore!', /nam?-ka w k°u'Xn/ 'go and borrow it!'; with an itr. verb /5ia'i-ka k°i w (?3-)stfi'nt-ax°/ 'lift it a little bit!', lit. 'act to a small degree ...'.
See Syntax 350. For negative commands see 301.","[161, 162, 163]"
"TRANSITIVIZERS7595. Stems with /a/: /na'mP-n/ 'go and get (someone)' (cf. /nam?-s/ 'bring, take'),
/5a'i-n/ 'follow, chase' (cf. 5i-Ca'¿2s/ 'id.'), /n-q'a'X-n/ 'put in the way' (cf. /n-q'aX-s/
'hit'), / q W - n / 'stop', /ha'mP-n/ 'cover', /nox^Pa'^n/ 'exchange' (cf. /nax^Pa'^s/
7d.'). The large proportion of cases where causative derivatives were recorded besides
/-n/ forms is striking.
95. Stems with /i/: / c W - n / 'help (out of a difficulty)', /si'P-n/ 'wipe', /Wt-n/ 'bring
close', /C'i'h-n/ 'lift, raise'.
77m; 7>.pe /CA'C-An/
97. Stems with /a/.— The type /Ca'C-an/ is hard to distinguish from /Ca'C-n/ in
careless speech; though there is no doubt that they are two different types, it is
possible that I have erred in one or the other direction in individual instances. The
following examples were recorded: /pa'5-an?-cut/ 'spread (ab. population)' (reflexive
suff. /-cut/), /pa'k°-an?/ 'cut (meat)', /pa'q>0-an / 'scatter', /pVc'-an/ 'sew', /p'a'k^an?/

'hit', /sa't-an?/ 'give', /sa'q'-an/ 'split', /sa'X-an?/ 'scrape', /sa'^-an?/ 'rub', /na'd'-an/
'change', /Sa'm-an?/ 'stick (something) out of the water (while submerged)', /k°a'i-an/
'hide', /q'a'IP-an/ 'believe', /q'aj-an?/ 'put high up', /X.a'q>0-an/ 'slap', /ua's-an?/
'remove from the fire', /ua'X-an/ 'chase away', /ja'q'-an/ 1. 'cause to fall down',
2. 'sharpen (by filing)', /ia'q°-an/ 'extinguish'.
95. Stems wj'i/j /£/; /p'i'c'-in/ 'squeeze', /mi'k>0-in/ 'wash', /mi'q'-in/ 'press down',
/ci'q-in?/ 'stab', /C'i'm-incut = -in-t-sut/ 'approach' (reflex, suff. /-sut/), /Wt'-in/

/X0i'q>0-inI 'tie up, connect', /?i'q>0-in/ 'rub off'.
99. Stems with /u/: /mu'i-un/ 'soak', /c'u'p'-un/ 'connect', /c'u'i-un?/ 'peel', /X,u'k°-un/
'push out of the way', /nu'q>0-un/ 'poke', /XVc'-un?/ 'lever, block up', /Pu's-un?/
'instruct, advise', /?u'X°-un?/ 'plane, dress, cut', /ju'c'-un?/ 'nudge, shove, push aside',
/ju'X-un/ 'burn'; alternative stresses in /tu'j^un, tui2u'n/ 'lean'(cf.?/tui/ 'goacross').
The Type /CVCC-a'n/
100. There are 29 examples (not counting the cases where the stem-final C represents
a productive suffix); of these, 21 concern stems /CaCC/: /pJ9sk>0-a'n/ 'squeeze',
/tmX-a'n/ 'paint', /t'mS-a'n/ 'braid', /clq'°-ain/ 'kick', /c'mq'-aty 'cut', /c'ls-a'n/
'scour', /XmS'-a'n/ 'chip', /tojq'-ah?/ 'pinch', /&>k°X-ain/ 'fry', /&>X,q°-a'n/ 'shove76MORPHOLOGYthrough a hole', /5'atq^-a'n?/ 'crumble', /qms-a'n/ 'pack', /qasn-a'n?/ 'miss',
/q'lq'-a'n/ 'wind around', /XauX.'-a'n/ 'break', /Xlq'-a'n/ 'knock off, roll down',
/q°3tq-a'n?/ 'pass by', /u3X.q°-a'n/ 'boil', /uac'q'-a'n?/ 'spread', /yaXq-a'n?/ 'chase
away', /jpX'q'-a'n/ 'paint'. Here also belong /C'auPa'n?/ 'recite, perform', where /u?/
is treated as /CC/ (cf. /na'uPn/, where it is not). In /S'iS'-a'n/ 'twist' we have the root
/5'i5\ CajC'/ 'id.; itr.' (see 16); the root of /siS'-a'n/ 'circle around' goes back to
•/SajgV or */&>i5/ (see 45; cf. /sif-§i?5/ 'all around'); in /<?ix°-a""n?/ 'to dry' the root is
/5'iPx"" = C'aji?x°/ 'dry'. The glottalization is preserved in /q°i?s-a'n/ 'boil'.
The type /CVCC-a'n/ is further represented by two examples with /i/: /Xicq-a'n?/
'fell (a tree)', /hiuq-a'n?/ 'shove, push', one with /u/: /?ux°n-a'n/ 'freeze', and one
with /a/: /tauP-a'n/ 'illuminate', where /u?/ has the effect of CC (cf. /fi'suP-a'n?/ above).
Examples with productive suffixes: /ciq-c-a'n?/ 'poke, stab someone in the mouth
/-c/', /ciq-q-a'n?/ 'W. in the behind /-q/', /Pus-c-a'n?/ 'teach (by word of mouth /-c/)',
/q'ac'-C-a'n?/ 'embrace' (suff. /-5/ 'back'), /pniq°-a'n?/ 'bury' (suff. /-q°/ 'head'),
/x°iiq°-aln?/ 'uncover, expose', /*°il?-q0-aln?/ 'cut off someone's head', etc.
In the stem-type CVCC with V other than /a/ the stress may fall on stem or suffix
or even on both; the suffix is unstressed /-n/, stressed /-a'n(?)/, e.g. /5n^Xi'cq-n/ vs.
/Xicq-a'n? w 5-n/ 'I (shall) fell it', /n-X°ill?-c-a'n/ 'open' (e.g. a door; recorded in
isolation with two equal stresses), /<5-n^nX°i'l?c-n/ 'I open it', /nX°il?c-aln-ka/
'open it!' (imperative suff. /-ka/).
Longer Units
101. Longer units include longer untransparent stems or stems with formatives,
stems with living suffixes longer than /-C/ (both improductive and productive combinations), and reduplicated stems. In the large majority of cases the stress falls on
the stem and the suffix is /-n/; there are, in addition, a few cases with /-in/. The
words with /-n/ usually allow an alternative or second stress on the suffix, which
then has the shape /-a'n(?)/.
Untransparant stems and stems with formatives: /p'a'iaq-n/ 'correct, cure',
/ta'iaq-n/ 'give', /q^a'iaq'-n/ 'turn over', /n-taPa'uP-n/ 'expect', /Pi'sauP-n/ 'chew',
/t'anPi'uP-n/ 'remove out of sight', /n3x°-ualn-iu?-n/ 'get tired waiting', /t 5 a'nam i n/
'weigh, measure', /ni'q >0 am-n/ 'make smooth', /x°ak'°i-aln-cut = -t-sut/ 'get drunk'
(lit. 'make oneself drunk', reflex, suff. /-sut/; here the stress is on the trans, suffix
because another suffix follows), /q'ia'Xan-n/ 'fence in' (from /q'ia'Xan/ 'fence'),
/si'XaP-n/ 'buy', /CmPa'P-n/ 'pack, carry on back', /m3'k°u?-n/ 'wrap, cover', /Pa'suP-n/
'sneeze' (see 85), /ti'uPiX-n/ 'protect', /Pu'msm-a'n/ 'wake up; tr.' (recorded only in
3rd pers. form /Pu'msma'ntas/).
As in the cases mentioned in 100, the stress is easily affected by added suffixes or
clitics, cf. /x0ak>0ia'ncut/ above, and e.g. /siX.a?a'n w 5-x7 '(you) buy it!' vs. /si'XaPn/
in isolation.
Stems with suffixes longer than /-C/ (a) with narrowed meaning: /timPa'-qs-n/77TRANSITIVIZERS'make a full turn (in canoe)', /iu'X-qs-n/ 'light a pipe', /nax'Mq'-u's-n/ 'sharpen',
/(n-^a'n^u's-n/ 'fold', /Xa-nauPa's-n/ 'pile up'; (b) productive combinations:
/X°ilq>°-qs-n/ 'tie ribbon on (a hairlock)', /ju'^-qs-n/ 'burn someone's nose', /Pu'c-qs-n/
'splice together' (a for /-qs-/ exceptional stress in /c'a-qs-a'n/ 'punch someone on the
nose', where the root /c'ah/ is reduced to /c'a-/ resulting in a stem CVCC, for which
/-a'n/ is regular, see 700), /mik>0-sn-a'n?/'wash someone's feet', /p'iP-sn-a'n?/ 'grab
someone's feet', /Xis-sn-a'nP-t-m/ 'be caught by a cramp in the leg' (see 120/.). As
these examples show, the position of the stress depends on the suffix, /-qs-/ requiring
the stress on the root CVC and /-§n-/ on the trans, suffix. In the case of suffixes
containing a full vowel, the stress remains on the stem (though it may shift from root
to lexical suffix): /mi'k^-us-n/ 'wash someone's face', /C'ifi'-u's-n/ 'strangle'. The
stress is on the transitivizer in /c'ai-tn^'n?/ 'to poison', derived from /c'a'X-tn/
'poison' (with the non-somatic suffix /-tn/ 'implement').
Reduplicated stems: /t'm-tVm-n/ 'chop up', /t>ax°-t>alx°-n/ 'take out one by one',
/3tal-Xl-q°-n/ 'cut someone's hair', /XVri^u's-n/ 'tell a story to'.
Cases with /-in/: /tVmuj^in/ 'repair', /c'ii'k^-in/ 'pinch', /su'i-uj-in/ 'make holes
with awl in', /X>ii'q°-in?/ 'squeeze', possibly /c'amPi'n?/ 'lick' (tr.?). The case
/naC.ni'CimPin?/ 'bawl out' may either belong here or contain the complex transitivizer
/-min?/, see 106.","[74, 75, 76, 77]"
"810PREFACEin detail to ""streamlining"" the description. The present book contains all the material
of which I dispose; on matters that are not treated (e.g. sentence-intonation, the
expression of ordinal numbers) data are lacking. The categorization of the material
is based primarily on formal criteria. Except in trivial cases, all available examples
of a given category are quoted (e.g. of a particular type of transitive verb or subordinate clause). In the Dictionary internal and external etymologies are given,
the latter take into account only those languages for which more or less extensive
word- or stem-lists are available (for details see p. 245f.). A number of uncertain
comparisons are included (marked ""Cf.?""); here additional data may show whether
the question-mark or the comparison itself has to be dropped.
In the course of my work on Squamish I had the pleasure of incurring debts of
gratitude to several persons and institutions.
First of all I want to thank Wayne Suttles, who introduced me both to Salish
linguistics and to all three of my informants. In the difficult initial stages of the
work it was a great advantage to be able to discuss problems with a fellow-linguist
interested in the same field. I have also greatly profited from Wayne Suttles' expert
ethnographical knowledge of the Coast Salish.
I gratefully acknowledge the help and encouragement given to me by Harry B.
Hawthorn. Thanks are also due to the Canadian Social Science Research Council,
which, through the good offices of Harry Hawthorn, defrayed my expenses for
travel and informant-fees.
I thank Mrs. Ingeborg Houwen-van Driel, Miss Vera Litwinzeff and Miss Sietske
Visser for their conscientious assistance in the preparation of the various drafts of
the manuscript. I am indebted to the Board of Curators of the University of Leiden
for providing secretarial help.
The greatest debt of all I owe to my informants. I dedicate this book to the memory of Isaac Jacob and Alec Peter, who patiently gave their best efforts in what to
them was an unfamiliar and difficult job, and to Louis Miranda, whose alert and
tireless assistance yielded so much both in material and in insight.","[9, 10]"
"PART IIISYNTAXXXI
OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SENTENCE244. A Squamish sentence regularly has the predicate at the beginning: /sui'Pqa
ta w sm3 l q'°a 1 ?/ 'Crane (was) a man' (11:1), lit. '(he was) a man, the crane', /ha'PA.
ta w la'm?/ 'the house (is) good', lit. '(it is) good, the house', /ck'Vcut ta w k'°a l t > an/
'the mouse runs', lit. 'it runs, the mouse', /PasnPi'u? t-ta^k 10 a l x°a? t a ^ j a q V j ? /
'the clothes are in the box' (answer to 'where are the clothes?'), lit. '(they are) inside
the box, the clothes', /¿3q0a'i? ta._na._PssnPi'u? t-ta w k , 0 a l x°a?/ 'there are clothes
in the box' (answer to 'what is in the box?'), lit. '(they are) clothes, the contents of
the box', /na w q >0 u l i.n3x°as ta w sui!?qa ta w mi'jtaX./ 'the man (has) killed the
bear', lit. 'he-killed-it, the man, the bear', /na^q > 0 u'i.nm X'a^Ta'm ta w mi'XaX/
'the bear was killed by Tom', lit. 'it was killed by Tom, the bear'.
Only certain sentence-adjuncts may precede the predicate, e.g. /PiuPa'iti n a w u a w
la'siuPiX t-ta w sma'nt k°i w ?a'Xqai?/ 'maybe there is a snake under the stone',
/na1? t-k 0 i w k°sk°i l n? y a ^ j a W t m t a ^ s t a ^ P x 0 ^ .../'in the old days the children
used to be warned ...'(1:1).
245. The subject of tr. and itr. verbs (and also the subject of a nominal predicate) is
in the absolutive case, and so is the object of a tr. verb, cf. the examples quoted in 244
and /SVm? ta w sc3'qi/ 'the salmon bites', /na^C'a'mP-t-m ta w s\}i'?qa/ 'the man
was bitten', /na w £Vm?-t-as ta^sq°ma l i? ta_mi l XaX/ 'the dog bit the bear'. The
usual order is tr. verb-subject-object (VtSO), but where the context leaves no room
for doubt the order VtOS is also possible, so that — given the right context — the last
sentence can also mean 'the bear bit the dog'.
246. Both itr. and tr. predicates may be accompanied by other relata than subject
or object. These secondary relata (R), if nominal, are in the relative case. They may
precede or follow the subject of an itr. predicate: /PasnPi'u? ta w sca'qi t-ta^si'tn/
or /PasnPi'y? t-ta w si'tn ta w sca'qi/ 'the salmon /sca'qi/ is in the basket';
/na w ?3st'a l t > q > ta w sc3'q t-tawSua'X./ 'the log is (lying) across the road', lit. 'it is
traverse, the log, to the road'. With trans, predicates R follows O : /na w Xi'6 > it-as
ta w smi'c (t-)ta w Xa'5'tn/ 'he cut the meat with the knife', /na w c3'x°nt-as170SYNTAXta w sq°ma l j[? t-ta w sma'nt/ 'he threw at the dog (O) with the stone', /£-n w nq'a'Xn
t a w q ' a ' i ? q t-ta w ya^(?3-)X, w nax°ta 1 ?/ 'I put the chair in your way'.
247. A special case of an R-relatum (Rx) is the initiator of an action expressed by a
passive verb (Vp); here the order VpRtS is by far the most usual. The type VpRjS
occurs as a free alternative of VtSO, i.e. as the equivalent of English subject-verbobject constructions. The sentence 'Tom bit Peter', then, can be rendered in Squamish
in four different ways (not counting the different possibilities in the use of articles):
1. V t SO /name's'm?tas
(2. V t OS /na_£ > 3 l m?tas
3. VpRiS /na w 5Vm?tm
4. VpSRi /na w 5'3 l m?tmtawTa'm tawPi'ta/
t a w P i ' t a ta^Ta'm/)
X'a.JTa'm t a ^ P i ' t a /
ta^Pi'ta r a ^ T a ' m /Of these, (2) needs the support of situation or context for the interpretation 'T. bit P.'
and not vice versa, while (3) is much more usual than (4). As was pointed out in 131,
in the case of a 3rd pers. actor and a 2nd pers. goal only a passive construction is
possible: /£-x°_6Vm?tm t-ta w sq°ma l j?/ 'you were bitten by the dog', 'the dog
bit you'.
248. The above general information on status and order of the elements of a Squamish
simple sentence is here summed up (N = pred. noun; Vi, Vt, Vp = itr., tr., pass, verb;
S = subject, O = object;
= initiator of action expressed by a pass, verb;
R a = other relatum; T = sentence-adjunct):

Ra(T)Column 1 contains the predicate-expression, columns 2-5 the parts of the sentence
specifying (S, O) and qualifying (R) the predicate; these need not all be present. The
order 2-5 is not obligatory, but by far the most usual. The trans, verb — passivized
or not — implies an extra referent (O or Rx) in comparison to the intransitive.
S and O are in the absolutive, R1; R a in the relative case. The initiator of the action
precedes the goal: S-O or Ri-S.","[165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170]"
"y
QUESTIONS OF WORD-PHONOLOGYA. THE OCCURRENCE OF /?/67. Glottalization is easily dropped in Squamish, especially in combinations /R?/,
which are almost always in free — or at least stylistic — variation with /R/ (the latter
variant is characteristic of rapid speech, but by no means limited to it). On the other
hand, there are many cases of /R/ not in free variation with /R?/, so that the two
must be distinguished. I write /R?/ always in all words where this pronunciation
was used regularly in careful speech; in the Dictionary alternative forms are given
when glottalized and plain forms were both common in careful speech, and where
such words occur in sentences I write /R/ or /R?/ as recorded in each particular case.
My material undoubtedly contains cases recorded only with /R/ but where /R?/ is
possible, and therefore in discussing the occurrence of /?/ I shall in several cases
have to register tendencies where a more detailed investigation may establish rules.
One generalization that can be made about the occurrence of /R?/ is that it is very
much more common in stressed syllables than in unstressed ones, and in the part of
the word following the stress than in that preceding it.
In the occurrences of /?/ two main groups of cases must be distinguished. In the
first of these, /?/ is a part of a morpheme as such; these cases concern morphemes
/?VC, CV?, CVR?/ and longer types such as /PVCC, CV?C, CVRPC/, etc. In the
second, the occurrence of /?/ is characteristic of certain morphological complexes as
such, and not of the morphemes entering into such complexes. We shall speak of
morphemic and morphological glottalization respectively. An example of morphemic
glottalization is /nam?/ 'come', of morphological glottalization /£i£a 'j?aqm/ 'follow
continuously; itr.\ cf. the non-reduplicated /ia'jaqm/ 'follow; itr.' without glottalization (and many similar pairs /CV-CVR?.../ vs. /CVR.../), cf. also the trans, derivative
/5a'i-nI 'follow; tr.' as opposed to /na'mP-n/ 'go and get someone; tr.'.
When morphemes are separated, I write /?-/ if the morpheme preceding /-/ was
recorded with/?/ in isolation, cf. /nam?/ and /na'm?-n/ above. Otherwise, /?/ and /-/
are combined as /*/. The transcriptions /R?-, V?-/ and /R2, V2/ do not imply a
phonemic difference. Nor is the distinction correlated to morphemic and morpho-52PHONOLOGYlogical glottalization: though all cases written /?-/ are morphemic, not all cases of/ 2 /
are necessarily morphological.
68. Morphemic Glottalization.— The cases of morphemic glottalization can be subdivided into those where /?/ takes the position of Cx and those where it does not; the
former type is referred to as ""preglottalization"".
In the position of C 1; /?/ is reduplicated like any other consonant, e.g. /Pu'miC/
'go upstream', /?u'-?um?i£/ 'be going upstream'. Preglottalizing /?-/ can be dropped
after a consonantal prefix, e.g. /s-(?)ac'a'm?3s/ 'women's shoulder blanket', but it is
not dropped as regularly as /h-/ in the same position (see 44).
A morpheme-final /?/ can be dropped in certain morphological formations, e.g. in
the unstressed syllable of a plural reduplication: /lam?, lmrla'm?/ 'house(s)\ /man?,
ma'nPrmn/ 'child(ren)'.
As was mentioned in 57, root-morphemes */Ca?/ do not occur; to this must be
added here that the sequence /a?/ is very rare in general: it was recorded in /sX°laua1?/
'turnip', /q0ux0q°ux°jpl?qm/ (besides /-ja'Pqm/) 'slide down', in the reduplications
/sa'PsqV 'chips of wood' (cf. /saq7 'split'), /qa'Pqi?/ 'soft' and /ua'Pu/ 'continue' (cf.
the clitic /ua/ 'continuously'), and unstressed in a few cases where /a/ probably is a
svarabhakti vowel, e.g. /taPu'sm/ 'look up', which could be unambiguously written
/tPu'sm/, with /t?/ [to?] different from /t'/.
69. Junctural Glottalization.— Glottalization may occur at the border between root
and suffix, or between suffixes, when the preceding one of these elements ends in a
vowel or sonant; in these cases we speak of junctural glottalization. There are two
groups of cases, depending on whether the following element begins in a vowel or a
consonant.
In the case of vocalic suffixes the phenomenon of junctural glottalization is simply
explained by the fact that such a suffix is potentially preglottalized. This preglottalization is maintained after a vowel and dropped after a cons, proper and /?/; after a
sonant it is usually absent, but it tends to be maintained in a particular group of cases
(see below). For instance, the combination of the suffix /-ulX/ 'young specimen' with
/sui'Pqa/ 'man', /puS/ 'cat', /sXa'naj?/ 'woman', /staqi'u/ 'horse' results in /sui?qa 2 u'R/
'boy', /pu§-u'lty 'kitten', /sXniP-u'lX./ 'girl' (see 36), /staqiu-u'lty 'colt'. Other examples
with stem-final sonants: /i°a ! j-a5/ 'have a paralyzed arm' (/-a6/ 'hand, arm'),
/t'lm-a'i?/ 'wild cherry tree' (/-ai?/ 'bush, tree'), /?upn-u'i?s/ 'ten large pieces' (/-ui?s/
'large piece'), /c'ah-u's/ 'be hit in the face' (/-us/ 'face'). The cases where glottalization
is maintained most often after sonants are the following:
(a) With the pronominal stems /tam/ 'what?', /Pin-/ '(the) one, (the) other', e.g.
/s-tam2a'i?/ 'what kind of tree?', /ti w n-s-?i'n 2 a£/ 'my /n-/ one (other) hand' (/s-/
nominalizer; /ti/ article).
(b) After connective /-aj[-/ (see 184), e.g. in /-aj2us/ 'eye', /-aj2a?n/ 'ear'.
(c) In a number of cases which make the impression of being recent formations,QUESTIONS OF WORD-PHONOLOGY53e.g. /suk>0-um2a'u?tx°/ 'bath-house', /c'aX-ti^a'n?/ 'to poison; tr.'; here the suffixes
/-au?tx°/ 'house', /-an?/ 'transitive' are added to stems already containing suffixes,
namely the intransitivizer /-um/ and the implement-suffix /-tn/ (/§u'k>0-um/ 'bathe;
itr.', /c'a'X-tn/ 'poison'), and such combinations are unusual. In response to a question
a propos of /hi-i'k°up/ 'big fire', IJ produced the artificial combination /?3ci'm2ik°up/
'small fire' (/Pad'm/ 'small').
(d) After roots /CAh/, with loss of the final sonant, cf. /iuh/ 'be careful', /ju^an/
'my hypothetical being careful', /iu l2 as/ 'his id.'; since such roots are often reduced to
/CA/ (60) this is but a special instance of preglottalization maintained after a vowel
(see above).
70. With consonantal suffixes junctural glottalization occurs most often in the case
of stems ending in a sonant other than /h/ followed by a suffix consisting of a single
consonant. Examples: /x°i2q° = x°3\lq°l 'be uncovered, exposed' (cf. /x°aj/ 'appear,
become visible'), /s-q°in*c/ 'beard' (/-c/ 'mouth'), /s-q°in26/ 'hair on the back' (cf.
/s-q°i'n-a5/ 'hair on the arm'), on the other hand /X°a'i-sn/ 'have a paralyzed leg'
(cf. /Xaj/ 'be senseless'). After a vowel: /hiil2c/ 'big mouth' (cf. /hii1/ 'big'), on the
other hand /n3x°-(h)iil-qs/ 'big-nosed'; however, glottalization is lacking in the
petrified combination /hii'-q 0 / 'headdress used by medicine-man'.
It is possible that this type of glottalization is due to the loss of /a/ between stem
and suffix, cf. the variation of /CVRaK/ and /CVR?K/ discussed in 47.
In a few instances junctural glottalization occurs when the plural suffix /-uit/ is
added to stems ending in a vowel. Though these combinations are pronounced
/Vu?it/, I transcribe /V2uit/, e.g. in /kVci^uit/ [k06'ceu?uet] 'those (absent)', cf.
/k°a'ci/ 'that one (absent)'. Compare for these cases section 29.
71. Reduplicative Glottalization.— Roots containing at least one sonant can become
glottalized in certain types of reduplicative formations. The most evident cases of
reduplicative glottalization are those where a root-initial resonant becomes glottalized,
e.g. /?3s»m3'-m?k°/ 'lumpy' as compared to /s-mak°/ 'lump', or where a final resonant
becomes glottalized at the end of a word, e.g. /?3s-k°al-k°aj[?/ 'hidden' as compared
to /k°ai/ 'to hide'. The first of these two types of cases is evident even if the root
was not recorded in isolation (since roots do not begin with */R?-/); the second is
not, because the glottalization may be morphemic, as it is, for instance, in the
verifiable case /k>0a'-k>0ai?/ 'be very hungry', cf. /k>0aji?/ 'be hungry'. Again, as
evident may be considered those cases where a longer unit (analyzable or not) is
unglottalized as a simplex and glottalized as a reduplication, e.g. /hi'l-it/ 'roll; tr.',
/hi'-hil2it/ 'roll continuously; tr.', /Pi'mas/ 'walk', /?i'-?im?a§/ 'be walking around'.
Due to the proliferation of reduplicative forms in Squamish, many morphemes are
found in such forms exclusively, and in these cases glottalization, if present, is always
doubtfully morphemic, and sometimes it could also be junctural. On the other hand,
absence of glottalization in a particular reduplicative form can always be counted as54PHONOLOGYan instance of lack of glottalization in the type of formation concerned, regardless
of whether or not the root was recorded in isolation. Therefore, if one counts the
unambiguous cases, one counts all those without, and only part of those with
reduplicative glottalization. The fact that probably a number of words recorded
with /R/ allow alternative forms with /R?/ (see 67) further tends to discriminate
against the number of cases where reduplicative glottalization occurs. It is possible
that a full account of reduplicative glottalization will have to distinguish not only
various formal types of reduplicative formations but also ad-hoc vs. petrified
cases. However, formal distinctions alone can be carried through so far that the
number of examples available for each category becomes too small to establish firm
rules. In the survey that follows, only the large-scale formal distinctions of sections
141-162 are made. Even so, reduplicative glottalization is clearly characteristic of
certain overall types as such, while for other types only a tendency to glottalization
can be established. Glottalization occurs:1
(1) Regularly in the type / Q A - Q Q / (755) when Q is a sonant: /Pas^li'-l?x°/
'lying down' (/lix°/ 'fall down'), /li-l?s/ 'be below' (/las/ 'bottom'), /li-l?q/ 'cheap'(*),
/ua-u?S/ 'keep away from the fire' (/ua'S-an?/ 'take away from the fire; tr.'), /ma'-mPli/
(geogr.)(*), /mu'-mPtm/ 'blue grouse'(*), possibly also /s-ui'-uPlus/ 'youth'. No
examples without glottalization.
(2) Regularly in the type /Qa-QCVOCy (156) when Q is a sonant and C a is not:
/n3x°-s»n9l-n?p/ 'follow a trail'(*), /ti-la'-lPs/ 'from below' (/las/ 'bottom'), /la'-IPC'/
'bright yellow'(*), /Pasrina'-mPk0/ 'lumpy' (/s-mak0/ 'lump'),
m/ 'be
boiling; itr.' (/u31Xq°-m/ 'boil; itr.'), /iiPqi1 = ia-i?qi'/ 'be creeping' (/jaqi1/ 'creep'),
/?as-iji?X° = -i9'-i?*7 'free, loose'(*), /haPX = ha-h?ty 'good' (/haX-i1/ 'become
good'). No examples without glottalization.
(3) Frequently in the same type /Qa-QOOCg/ when C a is a sonant (and in all
cases where simple roots CVR are involved): /pa-p^a't-uX = pa-pajV 'be hunting in
canoe' (/pi'atuX/), /ma'-mi?/ 'be sinking' (JmsU), /5a-£au2a't-ai?/ 'help each other'
(/5'a'u-at/ 'help; tr.'), /sa'-SauPai/ 'be growing' (/Sa'uaj/), /5a-§m?a'n-mrnauPas/ 'be
enemies' (/Sma'n/ 'enemy'), / k ^ ' - k ^ m / 'be thumping' (/k^'m-iPn/ 'thump'),
/qa-qi^i1?/ 'become bad' (/qi-i1?/), /?as-q°3 !-q°a?/ < */-q°ah?/ 'pierced' (/q°3h/ 'be
pierced'), /ja'-ilPX-t/ 'be looking for; tr.' (/¿alX-t/), in addition in unverifyable cases:
/pa'-piPs-m/ 'bubble; itr.', /ta'-tiPX0/ 'be busy', etc., but since a complex root-type
/CAPC/ exists, this glottalization may be junctural in origin (as in /s-Xam2xc/ 'rain',
see Dictionary), or an original complex /CaRP-C/ may be involved, in which case the
glottalization is morphemic. In a minority of cases no glottalization was recorded,
e.g. in /XaX-5a'-5mX/ 'chew resin' (/Sami/ 'resin'), /qa-qli'm-i?/ 'become soft'
(/qli'm-i?/).
(4) Regularly in diminutive reduplications (see 159) when the root begins in a
sonant: /li^litam/ 'little table' (/lata'm/, French la table), /li^lam?/ 'little house'
(/lam?/), /s-nil*nix°ity 'little canoe' (/s-nsx°VXf).
1Where no simplex was recorded this is indicated by (*).","[50, 51, 52, 53, 54]"
"IV
STRUCTURE O F MORPHEMESA. MORPHEMES CVC57. The favorite type of root-morpheme (i.e. morpheme other than clitic, affix or
reduplication-syllable) has the form Q V Q , where either C x or C 2 may also be
represented by /?/, and C 2 also by /R?/. Henceforth, when ""morphemes CVC"" are
discussed, the types /?VC, CV?, CVR?, ?VR?/ will be understood to be included.
When V in CVC is represented by A ( = full vowel), there is often a corresponding
form with /a/, e.g. /sa'q'-an/ 'split; tr.' (transitive suff. /-an/) and /saq'/ 'split; itr.';
/mui/ 'submerge' and /maj/ 'sink'. Under certain phonological conditions a morpheme
/CaC/ alternates with /CC/, cf. /saq'/ just quoted and /sq'-i'm?/ 'split; act.-itr.'.
Where forms /CAC/ and /C(a)C/ occur side by side, we speak of full and /a/- or
zero-grade.
From the morpheme-type CVC are excluded:
(a) Cases with identical C x and C 2 . In view of the very extensive use of reduplication
in Squamish, such formations are considered reduplicative. They are summed up in
section 161.
(b) The types */Cah(?), Cuu(?), Cij(?)/; in other words, no morpheme has a full
vowel followed by the corresponding sonant.
(c) The type */Ca?/.
(d) The type */?3R?/.
Subdividing the type C a VC 2 into classes according to the nature of C x and C 2 in
terms o f / K , ?, R, R?/ (the latter for C 2 only) and of V in terms of/A, a/, 3 X 2 X 4 = 24
possible sub-types are obtained, of which 5 are excluded (to wit */?A.?, ?a?, Ka?,
Ra?, ?aR?/).
The occurrence of /?/ after a sonant is often due to morphological factors (see 69-72);
furthermore, the types /CVR/ and /CVR?/ are sometimes in free variation even in the
most careful pronunciation. In giving examples, I quote only such cases as are
regularly pronounced without, resp. with /?/ when used in isolation or in formations
where /?/ is minimally suspect of being due to morphology. The types /Ca?, Cu?, Ci?/
are etymologically equivalent to /Cah?, Cay?, Cai?/, and these six are treated46PHONOLOGYseparately in 61-64, so that from the examples given below the types /KA?, RA?/ are
excluded as a whole, while of /KaR?, RaR?/ only examples with /m?, n?, 1?/ are quoted.
Of the very numerous types /KAK, KaK/ three examples each are quoted; of the
types ending in /R(?)/ examples with each of the sonants /m, n, 1, h, u, jj (in this
order) are given (in so far as they are available). When possible, free forms CVC are
quoted; next in line are forms with the nominalizing prefix /s-/ or with trans, and
intrans. suffixes. Where no such cases are available, the root is quoted as such.

in /s-?a'li/ 'dream', etc.; V? 3 i 'good'.
The Type /CVh/
58. In 8 the long vowels [a:, o:, e:] were interpreted phonemically as /ah, uh, ih/.
This interpretation is based on the following considerations. Given a root ending
in [a:], we find an alternant with [aeh] before a stressed vowel: /q°ah/ [q°a:] 'be
pierced', /q°ah-a'ia?n-i?n/ [q°oh-, q°aeh-] 'pierce someone's ears /-aia?n/; tr.'; /?ah/
[?a:] 'hurt', /?ah-a'num/ [?ah-, ?aeh-] 'be painfully hungry'; /c'ah/ [c'a:] 'be hit',
/c'ah-i'm?/ [c'seh-] 'throw punches; act.-itr.'. The interpretation of these forms asSTRUCTURE OF MORPHEMES47roots ending in /h/ is phonetically and structurally obvious. Since the vowel [a, o, a ]
before /h/ is not opposed to any other, the interpretations /a/ and /a/ are both possible.
Now, act.-itr. derivatives in /-im?/ of roots KVK either have a full vowel and rootstress, or zero-grade and stress on the suffix, e.g. /p'a'c'-im?/ 'sew' vs. /t'k'M'm?/ 'dig'
(full grade of root in /t'a'k^-an/ 'id.; tr.'). The stress in /c'ah-i'm?/ points to a root
with zero-grade; in fact, the transcription */c>hilm?/ would do as well, but since the
choice between the root-shapes /CaC/ and /CC/ is largely automatic, and the use of
the symbol /a/ is in principle a concession to phonetics (see 74, 75), we select the
transcription /Cah-/. As far as the non-suffixed forms are concerned, these could
still be interpreted as the corresponding full grades */Cah/, but this would be a
needless complication, and the evidence points to zero-grade. In the first place, where
the root of an act.-itr. derivative /CC-im?/ occurs without affixes, it has the form /CaC/,
cf. /t'q^-im?/ 'chop' and /t'aq' 0 / 'break, be bruised', /cx°-im?/ 'throw' and /c9x°/ 'get
hit', /sq'-im?/ 'split' and /saq'/ 'be split'. In the second place, the reduplication
/?as-q0a'-q°a?/ 'perforated', with /a/ in the reduplication-syllable, points to a root
/q°oh/ rather than */q°ah/ (cf. /?as-ta LtX0/ 'correct' besides /taX°/ 'be corrected' versus
/?as-k°a'-k0ai?/ 'hidden' besides /k°ai/ 'to hide'; see 154-156). Structurally, the interpretation /Cah/ allows the simple rule given in 57 under (b).
59. Of the three roots with final [o:, e:], two have zero-grade alternants with /ah-/,
which safeguards the interpretation /uh, ih/, cf. /puh-t/ 'blow' and /s-pah-i'm?/ 'wind'
(a nominalization of the act.-itr. form, as in /s-tV-i'm?/ 'pit, dugout' besides
/ t V - i ' m ? / 'dig; act.-itr.', full grade in /t'a'k^-an/ 'dig; tr.'), /5'i'h-n/ 'lift, raise' and
/d'ah-i'm?/ Hd.; act.-itr.'. The third case, /juh/ 'be careful' appears with zero-grade in
/ia-n?/ 'to warn', with the usual shortening of /ah/ to /a/ when non-vocalic suffixes
are added (cf. /q°ah/ 'be pierced' and /q°a-n/ 'pierce; tr.'). In this way, the alternation
of /u, i/ with /a/ is indicative of an original root ending in /h/ even in cases where the
vowels have been shortened. For instance, the word /¿u'jaPk0/ 'wave, current, rapids'
is recognizable as an instance of the reduplication-type /CAC-CaC/ (see 144) if an
original form */iuh-iah-k°/ is posited.
60. Roots /CAh/ are seldom preserved in their original form: they are usually
shortened to /CA/, e.g. /5'ih-/ appears as /5'i-/ in /S'i'-Sit/ 'lift up for someone',
/5'i'-q-am?/ 'rise from one's seat', lit. 'raise one's behind; itr.'. In the case of
morphemes which are encountered only in the shapes /Cu-, Ci-/ it is impossible to
say — in the absence of other data — whether they represent reductions of /Cuh, Cih/
or of /Cay, Caj/. Such is the case, for instance, with /cu-/ in /cu-t/ 'say', /cu-n/ 'tell,
order; tr.', /cu-cin/ 'mouth', and with V^'i- 'near' which occurs only with various
petrified extensions (but cf. CdA. 5'ih 'approach, get near').
The Type /CVR(?)/ with /h, y, ]J61. The morpheme-type CVR with /h, u, j/ as R falls into 9 groups according to the
nature of V and R as follows:48PHONOLOGYV
V \ih
1. Caua2. Caiu3. Cuh4. Cuii5. Cih6. Ciy—a7. Cah8. Cau9. CaiThese types will now be exemplified together with their glottalized counterparts
/CVR?/, except for the types (3) and (5), the instances of which were already quoted
in 57 (for glottalic counterparts see next section). In anticipation of a separate
discussion of the occurrence of /?/ (see 67-73) it is necessary to point out here that
plain and glottalized forms can be distinguished clearly only for morphemes used in
isolation or with prefixes. In many reduplicative and suffixed formations plain forms
become glottalized, and for morphemes whose occurrence is limited to such formations the ""independent"" shape in terms of/CVR/ or /CVR?/ cannot be established.
(1) /Cau(?)/ Plain: /kau/ 'descend', /q'a'u-at/ 'pay someone; tr.', /hau/ 'be not the
case'. Glottalized: /Sau?/ 'bone', /Xau?/ 'recover'.
(2) /Cai(?)/ Plain: /taj/ 'canoe-race', /q'aj/ 'be high up', /Vaj/ 'be as previously'.
Glottalized: /tai?/ 'that one', /k>0ai?/ 'be hungry', /tfaj?/ 'be sheltered'.
(4) /Cui(?)/ Plain: /mujj 'submerge', /tui/ 'go across', /q >0 uj/ 'die', /huj/ 'be finished'.
Glottalized: no independent examples. In /huj?s/, causative derivative of /hui/,
glottalization occurs, whereas otherwise this formation lacks it, cf. /kau-s/ 'bring
down', /hau-s/ 'refuse (see examples under 1.). The morphemic status of final /t/
in /t'ui?t/ 'medicine' is uncertain; the element /t'ui(?)-/ corresponds to Cw. -t'al-.
(6) /Ciu(?)/ Plain: no independent examples. Glottalized: /c'iu?/ 'healing up', A'iu?/
'run away (ab. a captive)', -v/niy? in /nax^ni'uP-it/ 'instruct'. Free variation in
/hiu(?)/ 'be upstream'.
(7) /Cah(?)/ Plain: /c'ah/ 'be hit', /q°ah/ 'be pierced', /?ah/ 'hurt'. Glottalized: /tah?/
'undergo', 'be located', /A,ah?/ 'be touched'.
(8) /Cau(?)/ Plain: /nau/ 'thou'. Glottalized: /s-Xau?/ 'dried salmon backbone',
/na'u?-n/ 'put in; tr.',
' n /Pas-ia'u?/ 'seer'.
(9) /Coi(?)/ Plain: /mai/ 'sink', /qsj/ 'bad', /pa'i-m/ 'fall overboard'. Glottalized:
/X'i? = X,5ai?/ 'dear', / « ? = S'aj?/ 'to fast', /x°i? = x°ai?/ 'be lost'.
52. As it was pointed out in 31-34, morphemes /Cah?, Cau?/ can have alternants
/Ca?, Cu?/, while /Cai?/ and /Ci?/ are not distinguished at all. The distribution of
the alternants is partly correlated to word-classes, cf. /tah?/ 'be located', /na'u?-n/
'put in; tr.' and the relator-verbs /tx°-ta?/ '(move) onto', /tx0Tnu?/ '(move) into',
partly it is automatic, namely in the case of /Cah?/, which appers as /Ca?-/ when
followed by a suffix. But besides the type /Cau?, Cu?/ there are morphemes which
appear only in the form /Cu?/, cf. /c'u?/ 'come out (being pulled)' (not a relator-verb!)STRUCTURE OF MORPHEMES49and the trans, derivatives /c'u'P-n/ 'pull out', /mu'?-n/ 'drop', which behave differently
from /na'uP-n/. Besides the type /Caj[? = Ci?/ there is the type /Ci?/ (see 22), represented by the roots of /p'i?-t/ 'seize; tr.' and /si?-n/ 'wipe; tr.'. Structurally, the
hypothesis seems justified that the type /Cu?/ not alternating with /Cau?/, and the
type /Ci?/ represent the ""missing"" glottalized types /Cuh?/ and /Cih?/. This interpretation can be corroborated only in the case of /p'i?-/ which has an alternant
/p'a?-/ in a number of derivatives, e.g., in act.-itr. /(Pi-jp'aP-i'm?/ 'hold', where the
stress points to zero-grade of the root, so that /p'a?-/ may well represent a medial
reduction of ""/p'ah?/.
63. The V p ' ^ occurs in a further stage of reduction in /Pi'-p'i-s/ 'take, hold; tr.'
(causative suff. /-s/) and in /p'ic7 'get trapped, squeezed'. These words have no
direct synchronic connection with Vp'i? (except for a possible ""symbolic"" value of
/p'-/), but they show that /Ci?/, like /Cih/, can be reduced to /Ci-/. I have no corresponding examples involving /Cu?/ < */Cuh?/.
64. Glottalized forms easily lose the the feature /?/ in rapid speech, and where forms
were recorded with and without /?/ I consider that with /?/ as the ""optimal"" one,
except in cases where even in careful pronunciation both forms are used, as in
/hiu(?)/ 'be upstream'. However, certain unexplained cases remain. The root which
otherwise occurs as /p'i?-, p'a?/ was recorded as /p'ah-/ in /n-p'ah-a '6/ 'palm of hand'
(but cf., with the same suffix /-a£/ 'hand', /p'a?-a'6-i?n/ 'grab someone by the hand;
tr.'). The root /tah?/ 'undergo' has the act.-itr. derivative /tah-i'm?/ or /taPh-i'm?/
'make'. The cases /np'aha'C, tahi'm?/ may be instances of loss of glottalization in
careless speech; the form /taPhi'm?/ may be a contamination of /tah-/ and /ta?-/
(cf. the parallel case /(?i-)pJa?-i'm?/ 'hold'; a form */ta?i'm?/ was not recorded).
But /taPhi'm?/ may also be regarded as a parallel to the variant [ei?jV] of /i?V/
(see 21), in which case a better transcription would be /taPi'm?/ or /tahPi'm?/, depending on whether or not /(Pi)p'aPi'm?/ allows a similar variant.
The root meaning 'name' appears in the usual forms /nah, na-/ in /s-nah/ 'name',
/na-n/ 'call, name; tr.' but was also recorded glottalized in /s-na?/ 'name' (a variant
*/nah?/ was not recorded).
B. LONGER MORPHEMES65. The most frequent type of root-morpheme larger than the type QVC, is the
type QVCjCa, where Q and C a stand for the same sounds as in QVCa (see 57), and
where C 3 cannot be /h, u, \ j and is rarely represented by /n, 1/ (as for a final /-m/,
this is so often the itr. suffix /-m/ that all units /CxVCgm/ are suspect of being bimorphemic). The most common representative of QVCjCj is therefore Q V Q K ,
here subdivided into /CVKK, CVRK, CVRPK, CVPK/. Examples:
/CVKK/: /nai5/ 'hand', /k^uX'k 0 / 'salt water', /5iSk°/ 'ebb', /c'aXt/ 'gravel beach'.","[44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]"
"PREFACE9tionship of this stock to Kutenai and Algonquian. 7 No thorough testing of these
hypotheses is possible because of insufficient data. 8
Of the Salish languages, only a few have received more or less extensive treatments
(overall or partial) in recent times: Halcomelem (Elmendorf-Suttles 1960: Vocabulary), Snoqualmie-Duwamish (Tweddell 1950: Phonology, Morphology), Upper
Chehalis (Kinkade 1963-64: Phonology, Morphology), Kalispel (Vogt 1940: Grammar, Texts, Dictionary), Coeur d'Alene (Reichard 1938: Grammar; 1939: Stem-List).
For others only sketchy and/or older data are available (see Bibliography).
A sketch of Squamish was published by Hill-Tout as part of an interesting ethnographical description.9 This material has to be used with caution because of an
inadequate and inconsistent notation and various other defects. Nevertheless, it
has not lost its value: Hill-Tout's word-list proved useful as a starting-point in obtaining lexical items, his phrases contain valuable syntactic material, and in individual
cases his data make it possible to establish an older, fuller word-form than was
recorded half a century later.
The material on which the present description is based was collected in the years
1951-54 and in the fall of 1956. — During the first of these periods I was on the
staff of the Department of Slavonic Studies of the University of British Columbia
in Vancouver. My informants were first Mr. Isaac Jacob (1883-1956): in the text
referred to as ""IJ"") of Capilano Reserve, and later Mr. Alex Peters, known as ""Alec
Peter"" (1881-1964; referred to as ""AP"") of Musqueam Reserve. Mr. Peters knew
Musqueam besides Squamish. The working-sessions were held at the homes of
the informants, and occasionally Mrs. Jacob and Mrs. Peters would make comments
or volunteer information. During this period a fairly large number of words, short
phrases and sentences were collected, and outlines of phonology and morphology
were worked out. Much remained problematic; also, I was unable to obtain longer
connected texts. — In the fall of 1956 I returned to Vancouver for a short period,
in which I had the good fortune of being able to engage the services of Mr. Louis
Miranda (born 1892; referred to as ""LM"") of Mission Indian Reserve. Mr. Miranda,
an exceptionally alert informant, was of great assistance in checking and clearing
up a number of difficult points. He was furthermore able to dictate texts, which
in turn provided additional lexical and grammatical material. Translations and a
rapid analysis of these texts were made while I could still dispose of Mr. Miranda's
invaluable cooperation.
The material thus obtained was further analysed and classified after my return
to Holland. To many questions which arose during the work answers could be
found in the available corpus. In a few cases alternative solutions had to be given
(the choice depending on Squamish forms not represented in the material). Some
questions had to remain open. In such cases I have preferred stating the problem

"92MORPHOLOGYA striking peculiarity of several forms of the paradigm is the combination of
parallel possessive and subject-affixes. This is the case in the forms /?n-...-an/ 'I ...
him, them' and /?3-...-ax°/ 'thou ... me, him'. In the forms with 1 plur. subject only
the possessive suffix /-Cat/ appears. In the forms with 2 plur. subject, the 2nd pers
possessive prefix /?a-/ is combined with the subject-suffix /-a(ja)p/; but the prefix
/?o-/ is usually dropped in medial position (e.g. after the article /k°i/) both in sing,
and plur. The forms with 3rd pers. subject are identical with those of the finite
paradigm except for the nominalizer /s-/. They could be interpreted morphophonemically as containing the possessive suffix /-s/ after the subject-suffix /-as/,
since /-as-s/ would not be distinct from /-as/ (see 41).
Another striking feature of the paradigm is the fact that the plural of the 2nd pers.
object is expressed by /-uit/; thus, while one says /5-n w 6 > a l u-at-umi-ap/ 'I help you',
the nominalized form is /Pn-s-C'a 'u-at-umi-uit/ 'my helping you', and in the same
way /C-t^d'a'u-at-umi-ap/ 'we help you' versus /s-S'a'u-at-umi-Sa't-uit/.
Summary of Subject-Object Paradigms
134. The nominal, finite, hypothetical and factual paradigms are summarized in a
chart on p. 93. Of the noun- and itr. verb-paradigms, 3rd and 1st pers. sing, are
given; of the tr. verb-paradigms the 3rd, 1st and 2nd pers. sing, for subject and object.
As the chart shows, the forms of nouns (in so far as recorded) and itr. verbs are
parallel except for the use of the clitic /na/. The tr. verb-paradigms differ from them
in that they make a wider use of subject-suffixes.
The 3rd pers. subject forms do not parallel those with 1st and 2nd pers. (a) because
combinations with /£-/ are limited to the latter, and (b) because in the finite, hypothetical and factual paradigms active forms with 3rd pers. subject and 2nd pers.
object are lacking. The hypothetical form '(if) I help you' cannot be conjectured
with confidence because the corresponding factual form is exceptional in lacking a
1st pers. subject-suffix.
Factual Forms with Nominalized Clitics
135. In factual forms the nominalizer /s-/ is often added not to the full stem itself
but to a preceding clitic, in particular to /na/ '(be) there' or /ya/ 'continue'. In these
cases the possessive affixes are added to the nominalized clitic. Of combinations
with / u a / 1 can give examples of the singular only:
/k 0 i^n-s-ua w t3'l?-t-an/
'my learning it'
/ k ^ t f ^ s - y a ^ t a ' l P - t - a x 0 / ' ^ learning it'
/k°i w s-ua-s w t3'l?-t-as/
'his learning it'
As a result of progressive vowel-assimilation (see 55) the latter form is also pronounced
/ k ° i w s-ui-s^.../.","[91, 92]"
"227. The deictic clitic /k°/ is in all probability etymologically identical with the
element /k°-/ which occurs in all the indefinite and non-present forms of the articles
(see 189). Unlike /na/ and /Pi/ it serves strictly temporal or circumstantial — and
never local — purposes. Its meaning corresponds to that of English 'now' or 'then'
when these words are used to convey that a certain point in time has been or is being
reached, or that a certain state has set in; /k°/ corresponds therefore also to English
'already'. Examples: / n a w , k ° w u a w c ' i c > a l p 7 'he has started to work', 'he is already
working', 'he is working now' (cf. /na w .ua w c > ic > a l p > / 'he is working'), / 5 - n w k ° w
pVty 'I'm sober now', / n a _ k 0 w k > 0 a ' s i ta^n*na'X5, . 5-n w k°_X3'l?/ 'now my
hands /naX5/ are warm /k>0a'si/, now I write /MP/' (said by a person whose hands
had been numb with cold), / n a ^ k ° w s i u 1 ?jux°a/ 'he's getting old (now)', / n a ^ k "" ^
X y i ' ? / 'it's getting dark (now)', / n a w k ° w r a i q > 0 / 'it's dark (now)'. It can also
refer to anticipated events: /5ia'X. C-n^k°wX,>x°31t ta w sni'5im/ 'I'll soon /fcia'X,/
master /X'x°3t/ the language (now)' (here /5-n. ,?i, ,>->x°3 ! t/ is also possible andPREDICATIVE CLITICS AND SUFFIXES159would mean ""just the same"" according to Mr. and Mrs. AP). Reference to past
events: /£-n w k 0 _^tax°X.§a?a l uan3x 0 ? i w k ° w i - n w M l q t-ti'ua/ 'I was thirty years
old when I arrived /X'iq/ here' (cf. /£-n_s?i'x°aX ?i^k° v ^C-n N _,na'm?
SqX°u'?miS/ 'I was a child when I went to Squamish'; the former sentence can be
interpreted as 'I had reached the age of 30', but the latter cannot be phrased 'I had
entered upon the state of childhood', and here /k""/ is lacking).
See Syntax 336, 351-356.
228. The continuous-iterative clitic /ua/ is etymologically identical with the reduplicated root /ua'iu/ 'continue'. It refers to a process as occupying a stretch of
time, as having a duration. This duration may concern either a single act, or the
regular (iterated) performance of it: / 5 - n _ u a w S u l k , ° u m / 1. 'I am taking a bath',
2. 'I am in the habit of bathing'. Other examples: /k >0 i'n k ^ ^ n a ^ u a ^ t a ' P s t - a x 0 /
'how many are you making?' versus /k'°i'n k 0 i w n a ^ t a ' ? s t - a x ° / 'how many did you
make?'; /na^cu't-uit k°i_n-srna w ua w ,sa l i?i?n/ 'they said that they could hear me
(or: that I made noises)', lit. '... my continually or repeatedly being audible' versus
/na w cu't-uit k 0 i^n-STna w sa'i?i?n/ 'they said that they heard me (or: that I made a
noise)', lit. 'my being audible'; / n a _ u a w ha'?X./ 'he is (feeling) well' versus/na w h a 'Pty
'he (it) is good'; / n a _ u a _ ? 3 ' n 5 a k°a w (?3-)k°u'pic/ 'where is your brother?' versus
/na^Pa'nCa k°i w la l m?-s k°a w ?-m3'n?/ 'where is your son's house?' (the former
sentence can be phrased 'where is he staying?', the second cannot); / n a w u a w c u ' t
t a ^ T a ' m k°i^s-?3sk >c a l j-s/ 'Tom said that it was impossible' (in the sense of 'held,
maintained, was of the opinion') versus / n a w c u ' t ""ha'u""/ 'he said: No!'.
See Syntax 277, 279, 328, 331, 333.
229. The temporal clitics /?aq7 or /Pit'/ 'future' and /t/ 'past' indicate posteriority,
resp. anteriority of an event relative either to the situation in which the utterance is
made or to the situation referred to by a previous utterance. When used within the
frame of reference of the speech-situation, they correspond to English 'will do',
resp. 'was doing, used to do, have done'; in the frame of reference of a story (dealing
with the past), they correspond to English 'would, was going to do', resp. 'had done'.
The future-indicator is not used in the case of an intention which the speaker will
carry out immediately: /C-n^na'mP-n/ 'I'll go and get him (right now)',
/k > 0 a'5-t_5-n/ 'I'll take a look (now)'.
Examples of /Paq'/ and /Pit*/ (which can replace each other in all cases):
/SVuat-umi^fc-a'n^Paq', ...6-a l n w ?itV 'I shall help you' (also with unstressed
/5-n/), /mi l w .5-n_?it > k V j l a s / 'I'll come tomorrow', /hi'nP^Pit' k°i_n-s*na'?/
'I'll stay there for a long time', lit. 'long will be my being there', /qaPi's^C-a'n^Pit'/
'I'll be right back', lit. 'soon I will be', cf. also /qa?i l s w ?it > / 1. 'he'll be right back',
2. 'it won't take long', / P u ^ a q ^ m i ' q Ca l Sn w 5-a l n w ?aq7 'if he comes (will

"XV
NOMINAL CLITICS (ARTICLES)189. Squamish employs a number of identifying and deictic elements which occur as
clitics before nominal expressions; some of them (the ""strong"" forms) can also occur
independently. They correspond roughly to English indef. and def. articles and
demonstrative pronouns. These elements are here summed up in a chart which shows
the oppositions existing in the deictic system :

"NUMERALSSpecial Numerical151Expressions214. There are special expressions for 'two days', etc., which in part consist of
numerals with a suffix /-¿as/ (so with 2, 3 and 9; the latter two with an additional
suffix /-x0/, resp. /-aty), while in the remaining cases simple numerals with two
stresses and lengthened medial consonants are used (the latter only with an adjacent
cf. 46):
ca'm-ias
'2 days'

Note that the additionally stressed vowel in '7 days' is /a/ and not /a/ as in
/t'ak^usa'C/ '7'.
The same forms occur in the names of the days Tuesday thru Friday, Monday
being considered the first day:
/s-ca'm-jas/
'Tuesday'
/s-Saln-x°-ias/ 'Wednesday'
/s-Xa'Pu'cn-s/ 'Thursday'
/s-ci'ia'Cis/
'Friday'
215. 'Once', 'twice', etc. are expressed as follows: /naS'-a'x""/ 'once', /cam-a1, camia1/
'twice' (probably a misrecording for /cam(?)a'?/), /5an-a'x°/ 'three times'; from 4 on
with the suffix /-al/: /Xa?ucn-a'X, ciaCis-a'X/, etc.
216. The hours of the day are referred to by the simple ordinals followed by an
element /q/ which may be identified with the clitic /q/ 'when, if' (see 231): /n5'u?-q/
'one o'clock', lit. 'one — when (it is)', /?a'n?us-q/ 'two o'clock', etc. There are
special expressions /sta'mqis)/ 'eleven o'clock' and /nuq°/ 'noon' (cf. /s-n3'q°-m/
'sun'), the latter according to LM an old expression now replaced by /ta'X0 sk°alj[l/,
lit. 'settled day(light) or sky'.
SuffixedNumerals217. Numerals occur with certain lexical suffixes. Some of the latter were recorded
with numerals only; these are indicated with ""num. only"" in the list below. Two
types of combinations of numeral + suffix may be distinguished. In the first, the152MORPHOLOGYsuffix simply refers to the object(s) counted; in the second, the suffix refers to the
class of the objects counted, and the name of the object is added to the suffixed
numeral. Combinations of the first type were recorded with the suffixes /-ay?tx°/
'house' and /-auanax0/ 'year'. Here follows a list of all suffixes recorded with
numerals (including the numerical interrogative):
/-mut/ (num. only) 'piece, part, individual specimen' (e.g., piece of wood, bark,
leather; or any member of a homogeneous collection): /XaPu'cnTinut scu'jai?/ 'four
pieces of leather', /k>0i'nTmut ti^_?ulx°umix7 'how many different tribes are there?',
/k>0i'nTmut k°i w ?i w Wq-s-t-ax°/ 'how many (individual items) did you bring?'.
See 186:1.
/-qs/ 'small (oblong) object': /XaPu'cn-qs sca'q, ~ Sa'mX/ 'four pieces of wood,
~ of pitch'. See 185:9.
/-ax°iX,/ (num. only) 'container' (bucket, bottle, pot, cup, plate, spoon, box, basket,
canoe): /Xa?ucn-a'x°iX, ta^n-S'auPa'i?/ 'I have four spoons', lit. 'four (are) my
spoons', /q_^?as^X,k°unwk>0iln-ax°iX/ 'I-don't-know how many canoes (full of
people)' (IV: 5).
/-ajum?/ 'small (roundish) object' (e.g., berry, marble, penny): /XaPu'cn-a'ium?/
'four'. See 186:26.
/-auanax0/ 'year': /tax0->.sa?-a'uanax0/ '30 years (old)', /k>0in-aua'n3X0/ 'how
many years (old)?'. See 186:19.
/-au?tx°/ 'house': /na'S'-auPtx"", ca'm^auPtx0, Sa'n-auPtx"", XaPu'cn^auPtx0/, etc.
'1, 2, 3, 4, etc., houses'. See 186:20.
/-ui?s/ 'large object, large piece, chunk' (e.g., rock; also used, without specifying
noun, for 'dollar'): /XaPu 'cn-uji?s sma 'nt/ 'four large rocks', /?u 'pn-ujPs/ 'ten dollars'.
See 186:33.
218. Of the above suffixes, /-uj?s, -qs, -mut/ are added to the independent forms of
the numerals 1-3, /-ax°iX./ takes the alternants /na£'-, cam-, San-/; I have no data on
/-ajum?/. Examples: /nS'u'P-uiPs, nS'u'P-qs, nS'u'P-mut/ but /na'C'-ax^X,, ca'm-ax°iX,
Ca'n-ax°iX/ (and further with the stress on the suffix /XaPucn-alx°iX, cia5is-a'x°iV. etc.).
The element /nC'u?, naC1-/ 'one' is also used in the sense '(the) one', '(the) other'
(see 207); in this sense, suffixed forms can be followed by a specifying noun, e.g.
/k°3ciwnal5,-au?tx° la'm? X'a^Pi'ta/ 'one of Peter's houses /lam?/' (also /k°3ci_
nfc'u1? la'm? Va^Pi'ta).
To sum up, the special alternants /nai1-, cam-, San-/ for '1, 2, 3' are used with the
suffixes /-(au2)iS/ '100'. /-ax°/ 'x times' (NB. /cam-a1/ 'twice'), /-jas/ 'days', /-au?tx°/
'house', /-ax°iX,/ 'container', probably also with /-auanax0/ 'year' (cf. the two above
cases with /-au-/).","[150, 151, 152]"
"ToLOUIS MIRANDA
and to the memory ofISAAC JACOB
andALEC PETERM A P OF THE SALISH LANGUAGE AREAPREFACEThe Squamish tribe, a subdivision of the Coast Salish stock of North America, at
one time inhabited the area around Howe Sound and along the banks of the lower
Squamish River and Cheakamus Creek in southern British Columbia. More recently they spread to the shores of English Bay, False Creek and Burrard Inlet as
far as Seymour Creek on the northern and Coal Harbour on the southern bank. 1
Their neighbors were the Sechelt in the west, the Lillooet in the north and northeast,
and Halcomelem-speaking tribes in the south and southeast. Their first contact
with white men occurred in the summer of 1792 when Captain Vancouver sailed
into English Bay and Howe Sound, an event still retained by popular memory (see
text IV). Early white settlers estimated the number of the Squamish at several
thousands.2 The tribe was decimated by a succession of smallpox epidemics, and
was reduced to a few hundred at the end of the 19th century. Though since then
the population has increased,3 the language is now close to extinction: it is spoken
only by older people (number unknown) most of whom are living in the Vancouver
area.
A classification of the Salish languages was made by Swadesh on the basis of a
lexicostatistical analysis of comparative vocabularies in the Boas Collection of the
American Philosophical Society.4 This classification, which progresses from Divisions to Branches, Groups and Languages, is quoted below with some changes and
additions. A few alternative designations are given in parentheses. Where Swadesh's
groups encompass more than one language, his group-names may cause confusion,
being identical with group-member names. In these cases they are replaced by other
names where such have been proposed; otherwise they are left out and the group
is identified by an Arabic numeral only. In some groups a number of languagenames have been added for practical reasons, and the languages within each group
are listed without further bracketing. In the case of the Halcomelem (II B2) as well

"QUESTIONS OF WORD-PHONOLOGY59D. GROUPS OF CONSONANTS PROPER
77. The zero-alternant of a morpheme K V K can occur word-initially (e.g. / t V - i ' m ? /
'dig; act.-itr.', of -v/t'ak' 0 , t'ak' 0 ), so that in principle any group K K can occur in
this position. There is therefore no need to sum u p the ca. 90 initial groups K K
which occur in my material: further additions to the lexicon will add to them in a
random way. The groups are spread evenly over the grid of possibilities, except that
groups beginning in /s-/ are particularly numerous due to the frequent use of the
nominalizer /s-/. Initial groups K K K involve either this nominalizer or one of the
prefixes /tx 0 -/ (directional), /sx°-/ 'step (-relative)', e.g. /sx°-5i'Sa?/ 'step-mother' (here
also belongs /X(s)q'i?s/ 'to know', see 65).
Medial and final groups are also determined morphologically. Some represent
zero-alternants, e.g. /q 0 3'-q°tq/ 'be passing by', a reduplication of /q°3tq/; others
result from suffixation of morphemes /-K, -KK/, e.g. /Pas-Xa'uV-Cq/ 'lame'. A special
type of medial group results from the reduplication-type / K ^ V K ^ K J i J , e.g.
/qa'p'-qp'-us/ 'ly facing downward', lit. 'close /qapV face /-us/', /Pas-t'aX-t'X-a'Cx0/
'branchy, many-limbed', cf. -y/t'sX 'open', suif. /-a6x°/ 'branches, foliage'.
The only consonant-sequences that are systematically excluded are groups of
/s/ + /£, 5', S/. Where such a group would be expected morphologically, /§/ is found
instead of /s/. We transcribe /s/ in all cases where there is no morphological evidence
to the contrary (and in the large majority of these cases, there is positive evidence
for /s/). The nominalizer /s-/ may serve as an example: /s-£iX-c/ [s£-] 'upper lip',
/s-d'aq/ [§£'-] 'dirt'. The nominalizer is assimilated even before the zero-form of a
root with a palatal C s , e.g. /s-q >0 §3'cut/ [sq'°s-] 'toy' (cf. /q >0 sa-t, q'^a'cut/ 'play;
tr. and refl.').
E. ALTERNATIONS
78. Except for the partly automatic alternations to which roots ending in a sonant
are subject (see 14-19, 31-34), for the loss of an initial /h/ or /?/ (43, 44) and for the
alternation of full and /a/- or zero-grade (57), Squamish has but a few instances of
alternating forms. Those concerning clitics were already mentioned in 56. All other
cases are incidental; they are summed u p here according to the type of alternation
concerned.
(1) Free variation of forms with /t'/ and /X,'/ in /t'aX.na'im, X'aLna'im/ 'go on a
prolonged hunting-trip', /st'l.mu'Pt, sX'l.mu't/ 'old person' (the absence of /?/ in the
second form is probably incidental).
(2) Free variation of forms with /X'a?-/ and ¡V-l in /X'aPa'Sn, k'a'Sn/ '(invite to)
feast, party, dance (not potlatch)', /X'aPa'nq, Vanq/ 'potlatch' (cf. also /X'aPi'min/
'sinew' and Cw. X'i 'man 'tendon').
(3) Loss of final vowel before vocalic suffixes in /hii 1 , hi-/ 'big', /?ina, Pin-/ 'the
one, the other'.
(4) Roots with any vowel can have an alternant with /i/ in diminutive forms. This60PHONOLOGYhappens regularly in diminutive reduplications of polysyllabic stems, and occasionally
in other cases, see 159. In a few instances, roots with /a/ appear with /i/ in related
words without obvious diminutive meaning, cf. /malq""/ 'be mixed' and /mlrmi'lC'/
'get mixed up', /A.a'C'-tn/'knife' and /Xi5*/ 'be cut', the unique pair /sui'uPlus/ 'young
man' and /sua'uPlus/ 'id., plur.'. The difference /a/ w. /i/ is accompanied by other
phonetic differences in /XauPs/ 'new, fresh' and /Xis-i?/ (stress unknown) 'be fresh',
/X,au?/ 'recover; run away (ab. a captive)' and /X,'iu?/ 'run away (ab. a captive)'.
(4) An alternation /a/-/u/ occurs in the pairs /?acq/ 'the outdoors, outside' and
/?ucq/ 'go outside', \/? a i(?) 'inside' (/?aj[-s/ 'be inside', /?ai*tx°/ 'be at home',
/?i-?a'i2uX,/ 'be aboard') and V? u i 'enter' (/?ui-s/ 'enter', /Pu'j-uX,/ 'go aboard').

See Syntax 329, 331, 335.
230. The modal clitic /?u/ as initial element of a predicate corresponds to English
conditional 'if'; when another element precedes it, /?u/ functions as an interrogative
particle, the element preceding being the focus of the question (only one clitic or
full word can precede /?u/ in a sentence).
Examples A (conditional): /Pu^ha'PX, siXa?a'nw5-n/ 'if it's good, I'll buy it',
/?u w £-n w ci'x° c u ' t ^ - n ^ P a q ' / 'if I get there, I'll say it', /?u w ?aq > w mi v _X , i l q

hu'i.nax 0 w 5-n w q/ 'if he helps me, I can finish it', lit. 'I would /q/ get it done'. For
the expression of an irreal condition see 231, 292.
Examples B (interrogative): /ha'?k w ?u k°a_?-la'm?/ 'is your house good?',
/Pa-suaPa'm^Pu ta'i?/ 'is he (there) a relative of yours?', /si'?n^,?u^fi-n/ 'shall I

C-x° w t s _ua^c > ic > a l p7 'have you ever worked?', /ni'A-^Pu Pa-STmn^huja1?/ 'are
you going to leave right away?', lit. 'is this your leaving?'.
See Syntax 330.
231. The modal clitic /q/ marks a predicate as irreal in the widest sense of the word.
It comprises facts which are yet to occur (English 'when' referring to the future),
facts that are supposed (English 'if') or suggested ('do you think that...?'), and facts
that are denied (all negative sentences). In this way, both /?u/ and /q/ can mark
conditional phrases, and sometimes both can translate the same English 'if'-phrase:
/?u w ha'?k/ and /q w (h)a'?X-as/ can both correspond to 'if it's good', but they do
so on the basis of different meanings. The clitic /?u/ adds a sign 'given the condition
that ...' to a predicate expressing a fact; /q/ presents the fact itself as not (yet) real,
and the second phrase just quoted means rather 'when it will be good', 'should it
(turn out to) be good'. The expression of an irreal condition requires the use of
both conditional /?u/ and irreal /q/. Here follow a few examples of /q/-clauses:
/?i l tut w 5-x° q^Pas^qa'np ta w sn3'q°m/'goto sleep /Pi 'tut/ when the sun/sn3'q°m/

'finally', 'at last': /¿a'A, s - s w m n w ? i l ? i ° mu'j/ 'finally she submerged completely'
(111:24; cf. also IV: 22, 28). Here the cases without /mn/ differ slightly in meaning
from the above: /¿a'A, s-s^Pa'nuX-uit/ 'finally they consented' (IV:32; cf. also
111:24, 37).
346. The combination / m n ^ a ' V means 'just (recently)', also 'for the first time' (the
latter particularly if the following predicate lacks a clitic /na/ or /Pi/): /mn w ia'X,
n-STnawhu'i.n3X°-an/ 'I've just finished it', / m n w i a ' X s-s w ,hu'i.n3x°-as/ 'he has just
finished it', /mnwia'X s - s w n a m ? ^ ? u ' c q / 'he just went out', /mnwia'X, n-s-?i w
c'ic'a'p'/ 'I've just started to work', /mn^Ja'X n - s - P i ^ W q / or /mnwia'X n - S r n a w
X'i'q/ 'I've just arrived', /mn w ia'X, n-s-Pi'Xn/ 'I've just started to eat', /mn w ia'X
s-Pi'Xn-s/ 'he has just started to eat', /mnwia'X, PasSua'S-s/ 'he had just married'
(111:3; recorded without nominalizer /s-f, see comments to text). A sentence like
/mnwia'X. s-Pi'Xn-s/ 'he has just started to eat' can be applied to someone who has
just sat down to a meal, or to someone who has just started eating again after a fast;
the latter type of use easily leads to that in the sense of 'for the first time', e.g.
/mn^Ja'X n-s-Vi'q/ 'it is the first time I ever come here', /mn w ia'X n-s-tk°a'ia?nT
mint-an/ 'I hear it for the first time'.
347. The clitic /mn/ is usually present in predicates introduced by /ja'mn/ 'even if',
'even though' (which itself contains the element /mn/): /ja'mn n a w m n w t a l X m ? x ° ,
? i ^ m ? i w X ' i l q / 'even though it rained, he came', /ja'mn na w mn^ni?nl?u 1 ?,
n a w m n _ h u l i . n 3 x ° a s / 'although he was alone, he finished it', /ja'mn mn^C'a'uatm,
?3sk>0a'i k°i w s-hu l j.n3x 0 as/ 'even if he gets help, he can't finish it', /ja'mn n a _ m n w
Ca'uatm/ 'even though he got help'. The use of /mn/ is not in all cases obligatory,
cf. /ja'mn 5-x° w 5 > a l uat/ 'even if you help him'.
348. Examples of /mn/ in other syntactic surroundings: / n w a u w c > i c > a l p ' Pi1
q w . ? a s w m n w ? i l t u t / 'did he work or go to sleep?' (see 298), / n a w k ° w h i i i a l ?
k°alci2uit, ? i w £ - n ^ ? a q > w m n w n a l m ? Pi'mn/ 'they went already, I'm going also
/Pimn/'. For / ? i w k ° w . . . w m n / see 356.
Suffixes
349. The suffix /-£'/ was recorded after /C-n/, etc., /na/, /ua/, /Pi/, /niX/ and the personal
pronouns, in one case after a verb-stem followed by a verbal secondary relatum:
/5-nT5 > s _ua w ci l Xc/ 'I must have been speaking too fast', /na'-S' ta'q°ant-as-uit/
'they must have drunk it', /ua'-C' kla,xGai?m/ 'apparently he wants to play /kta'x 0 /'
(IV: 13), /?i L 5' ni'X u a ^ X a X s p W a m / 'that one must have been smoking' (IV: 11),
/ni'X-6' n a w h u ' i ? s / 'he must have eaten it', /ni'X-fc'-yit na^,ta'q°an/ 'they must have212SYNTAXdrunk it', /ni'X-5' s - s ^ m n ^ q ' c a ' m ? / 'then he must have fainted' (111:32), /Pa'ns-C'
na w X9 l p > .n3x°/ '/ must have broken it'; in the same way /na'u-C', ni'maX-C',
na'u-jap-CV- The clitic is attached to the verb-stem in / P i w k ° w n a w m n w ( n ) s ? i l t - £ >
mi'k^i/ 'until he must have become really cleansed' (111:28).
For /-x°/ see 241; for the plural suffixes /-uit, -¿ap/ attached to clitics see 274.
350. The imperative suffix /-ka/ is attached to the verb-stem (which may include an
object-suffix); if a clitic /nam?/ or /m?i/ precedes the verb, /-ka/ is added to the latter.
For examples see 239. In phrases containing a verbal secondary relatum, /-ka/ is
added to the main verb: /qiPa't-ka Xi'S'it/ or ¡Xi'5'it-ka qiPa't/ 'cut it again!'.
The Squamish equivalent of'let us ...' is /hu'jPs-ka/ (probably involving a causative
derivative of /huj/ 'be ready'), e.g. /hu'jPs-ka lu'lum/ 'let us sing!'.
