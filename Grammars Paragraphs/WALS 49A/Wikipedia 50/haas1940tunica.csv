10.12THEINDEPENDENTPERSONALPRONOUNSThe independent personal pronouns are inflected for person,
gender, and number (4.22) but do not have special forms distinguished as to the indeterminative and determinative categories as
nouns do. They are used as substitutes for nouns and hence,
except for the fact that they do not occur in the locative case
(noun use no. 6), they may be used in all the ways that nouns are
used, €.g.,

"He does not get angry < ?uya’ sitt + -k?ahaThe reason for this is to be found in the fact that the positive inchoative forms of static verbs are constructed by the use of elements normally employed by active verbs (4.731).
4.8NounINFLECTION4.81GENERALREMARKSThe primary categories of the noun are the indeterminative and
the determinative. The indeterminative category consists of the
simple uninflected noun stem which may serve as either a singularor a plural, e.g., ru’sta ‘‘a rabbit; rabbits.””Thedeterminativecategory, on the other hand, is marked by the use of the determin-ing prefixes, i.e., either the articular prefix (4.82) or the pronominal prefixes (denoting possession with nouns; 4.83). In addition
the determinative category is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.! The
first of these is called the definitive because it requires the use of
the gender-number suffixes (4.841) and is the only category in
which the gender and number of a noun are explicitly defined.’
The non-definitive case makes use of no inflectional suffixes whatsoever and may be construed as either a singular or a plural depending on context. The locative case is expressed by one of three
locative suffixes (4.85) and, like the non-definitive case, may be
construed as either a singular or a plural depending on context.
1 The syntactic functions of these cases are described in section 10.11.
? The rules for the gender-number classification of nouns are provided in section 8.1.",[61]
"Theinflected classes are the independentpronouns, nouns, and the three classes of verbs.personalThe remainingword-classes, which some might prefer to group together as noninflected particles, are distinguished here because of definitive differences in syntactic usage (see section 10).

4.1INFLECTION
GENERALREMARKSInflection is accomplished almost exclusively by means of syntactic affixes of the inflective type. However, suppletion and reduplication are employed in the inflection of the auxiliary verbs
and the periphrastic inflection of active verbs is accomplished by
juxtaposition with auxiliary verbs.
The primary paradigmatic categories of the verb consist of the
semelfactive, habitual, and repetitive aspects, and the conditional
mode. Each of these categories comprises a separate paradigm
and the inflectional categories of each paradigm consist of person,
number, and gender. On the other hand, the expression of the
future tense and of several types of modes (including an alternative method of expressing the conditional) is accomplished by
means of postfixes (i.e., syntactic affixes of the non-inflective
type) but does not function as a part of the inflectional system of
verbs as such.
Two paradigms of personal pronouns are distinguished, the
dependent and the independent. The inflectional categories employed by both are the same as those of verbal paradigms, namely,
person, number, and gender.
The primary categories of the noun are the indeterminative and
the determinative.
The latter is further subdivided into three
case-categories, the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.
It is noteworthy that whereas the gender and number of a noun are
of primary importance on the syntactic level, these are not explicitly defined on the morphological level except in the definitive
case.
It will now be pertinent to further describe the inflectional cate-gories of person, number,and gender.",[35]
"When adjectives are used with nouns functioning as sub-jects or objects, they are incorporated into the noun complex; see10.41.
In some cases quantificatives are also so incorporated
(10.21) and in still other cases they stand in apposition to the
noun (7.591).
7.56THEPREDICATEMODIFIERPredicate modifiers may be words, phrases, or clauses. Words
used in this way are adjectives, comparatives, adverbs, and locative nouns. Phrases and clauses used in this way are always adverbial.
Adjectives are used as modifiers of noun predicative words,
€.g.,
ciéku, ku’wa lapo'ni.(43a: b) The crow woodpecker i is a goodbird, it is said. (lapo’nt < la’pu good + -a’ni, modifying
the noun ku’wa bird)Comparatives are used as modifiers of adjective, quantificative,
and static verb predicative words, e.g.,
ta’nisarahé, ta’ gle pano'ni. (3a:a) The girl was very beautiful,
it is said. (pano'nt < pa’nu very + -a’ni, modifying the
adj. ta’ Sle beautiful)se’man, na’mu ri'kine'nt. (29:c) They were too many, it is said.
(ri'kine'nt < ri'kint too + -a’nt, modifying the quantif.
na'mu many)
sinsru'ka pana'ni. (18:b) They were greatly frightened, it is
said. (pana'ni < pa'nu very, greatly + -a’ni, modifying
the st. vb. sinsru’ka)Adverbs and locative nouns are used as modifiers of auxiliary
and active verb predicatives, e.g.,
hi’ Stahahk ?awa'cina’?ara’ni.
(22a:1) They were still fighting
together, it is said. (hz’Stahahki still, adv., modifying the
act. vb. ?awa’éina’?ara’nt)
?u'ris 2ata’ni. (4a:ae) She went to his house, it is said. (?u’/ris¢
to his house, loc. noun modifying the aux. vb. ?ata’nt)Adverbial phrases and clauses are likewise used as modifiers of96HAASTUNICAauxiliary or active verb predicatives. Adverbial phrases consist of
a substantive governed by a postposition, e.g.,
ta'rku kt’ Gin, 2a'k?uwa'ni.it is said.(6a:c) He went off into the woods,(ta’rku the woods + ki’éu in, into, adv. phrasemodifying the act. vb. ?a’k?uwa’nz)Adverbial clauses are ‘‘where’’ clauses or locative clauses.
use as predicate modifiers is illustrated in 7.46.
7.57THEPREDICATETheirCOMPLEMENTPredicate complements complete the sense of the predicate and
may be either words or clauses. Words used in this way are independent personal pronouns, nouns, interrogative-indefinite pronouns, quantificatives, adjectives, and active verb infinitives.
Independent personal pronouns, nouns, and interrogativeindefinite pronouns are used as complements of static verb predicatives or of impersonal or transimpersonal active verb predicatives, e.g.,
?u’win, ?uspt't?oke'ni, ta’héin. (13:an) He forgot her, it is said.
(ta’hét, 3FS pron., complement of the st. vb. ?usp7’t?ake’nt)
ta'hika ta’ythkun, yu’ katihé (12:d) when seven years had passed
< whenit reachedsevenyears(t’hika year + ta’yihkuseven, complement of the imp. act. vb. yu’katthé)
?u'win, ni’mdn, ?uhpt'r?ake'ni. (9:p) He turned into a horned
owl, it is said < it turned him into a horned owl, it is said.(ni’ma a horned owl, complement of the trsimp. act. vb.
Puhpi'r?ake'nt)Quantificatives are used as complements of static verb predicatives, e€.g.,
sv’hktin, wiwa'nak?thé (13:w) if you want one
complement of the st. vb. wiwa’nak?thé)
Adjectives are used as complements(sa’hku one,of impersonal active verbpredicatives, e.g.,
mai'li ya'kate'nt. (36B:c) It would turn red, it is said.
complement of the imp. act. vb. ya’kate’nz)(mz’ld red,Active verb infinitives are used as complements of static verb
predicatives when the implied subject of the infinitive is the same
as the logical subject (grammatical object) of the static verb, e.g.,

complement of ?:wa’na)(lo’ta to run, act. vb. infin.,HANDBOOKOFAMERICANINDIANLANGUAGES97Contrariwise, conditional clauses are used as complements of staticverb predicatives when the subject of the clause is not the same as
the logical subject (grammatical object) of the static verb, e.g.,
ta’yimuhke’rihé, ?ima’ §?ck?thé, ?t’wand.","[94, 95, 96]"
"Other special points regarding the use of the independent personal pronouns follow:
(1) Theyare used as substitutes only for animatenounsandmust agree with them in gender and number (see 8.22).
(2) Since all verbs contain pronominal referentials it is not
necessary to employ an independent personal pronoun as independent subject or object unless there is a shift in the animate
referred to. In other words, once the characters are established
in the context by means of nominal referees, the independent personal pronouns are used in cases like the following:
ka’na la’pu yu'k?éné, la’pu sa’k?ik?ahed, 2uni’kate’ni.
tthé, ?u'win, pa’kahk?uta'ni. ta’hein, ya'nakate'ni.hinya'?u'win,pa'kahk?u't?una’ni. (4a:d) “If I cook something good, you

(27) -8a“‘ . . .-ish; almost, not quite, somewhat.” It does not
occur in the texts, but in non-text examples it is used with adjectives and with non-inchoative static verb forms, e.g.,
mt'liga reddish; almost, not quite red (< mi'lired + -Sa)
2usru’kasa he’s somewhat afraid (< ?usru’ka he’s afraid+ -§a)
(28) -&t?e “very much”(prob. < -Sa + -i?e, aug. suff.), usedwith adjectives and with non-inchoative static verb forms, e.g.,

available material. Some of these are probably archaic and most
of them are of doubtful meaning.
(31) -we, prob. an archaic exhortative postf., occurring in two
identical examples, viz., sa’kunawé (224:f, 22B:f) which the informant translated as ‘‘Let’s eat!” If the first person dual is implied it should be sa’k?inawé and the form as dictated is apparentlyincorrect. In corroboration of this we find that Gatschet wrote the
form as sa’kinawe ! and, since he did not record glottal stops, we
may read his form as sa’k?inawe < sa'k?ina “we eat’? + -we.(82) -yo, of no certain meaning, occurring only in the word
?7’mayo (4A:ar, 4B:ap, 4B:aq, 4B:ar) with the meaning “‘It is I”
(< ?¢’ma, 1s pron., + -yo).
(33) -tan, some kind of subordinating postf. In the only two
instances of its occurrence it is translated once as ‘‘after’’ and once
as “while,” e.g., 2a’m?uhkitan (4a:p) “after he had gone” (< ?a’m?uhki “he had gone” + -tan); hi’htin, ?u'natan (4a:bd) “‘while
he lived there” (?u'natan < ?u’na “he lived” + -tan).
(84) An element -at (or possibly -hat, though apparently unrelated to no. 21) is used once with a verb form, viz., po’nihcét (30)
“when I looked” (< po’ni “I looked” + -héi + -at or -hat). It is
assumed that -hci may be the unapocopated form of -hé (no. 4
above) but it has not been possible to establish a meaning for -at
or -hat; note that po’nihé (< po’ni + -hé) would mean ‘“‘when I
looked.”
(35)In one case an element -?aha is used in a context whichdoes not require a negative (see no. 18). In this case it has seemed
appropriateto rendertheelementas‘“‘indeed,”’viz.,te’hé?ehé,?o’wand (13:y) “It is she, indeed, (that) I want.” (ti’héehe < ta’hi, 3FS8 pron., + -?aha). Though the same form could mean “‘it is
not she,” such a rendition would not fit the context.
9.37ORDEROF THEPOSTFIXESIn certain cases more than one postfix is attached to the same
word and in this event their order is fixed. Note the following
rules. The references are to 9.32, 9.33 and 9.34:
Rule 1. The quotative postfix -a’ni (no. 6) follows any other
postfix which is used with the same word, e.g.,
lu'piwik?ahéa'nt.

"There are, however, aspecial group of stems, known as inalienably possessed noun
stems, which cannot be used without a pronominal prefix. Stems
of this type include:
(1) kinship terms, e.g., -e’st “father”; '-gaci “‘mother’’; ’-ki
“maternal uncle’’; -a’haya “‘sibling of the opposite sex”; -a’néayt
“wife”; -Sa’yz “husband.”
(2) body-part terms, e.g., -e’sint “head”; -e’neri “horns”;-e’ruhki “neck”;’-lu “tongue”;-e’yu “arm”;-a’htart “wing”;‘-hkeni “‘hand”’; -a’ska ‘“foot’’; -a’stayi “body.”
(3) the miscellaneous terms -e’htiwa’hkunt “breechcloth” ; -e’hi-Zura “‘clothing’’; -e’tisa ‘“‘name.”’
Inalienably possessed nouns take the inalienable prefixes while
all other nouns take the alienable prefixes. Examples of inalienably possessed nouns are:

The gender-number suffixes may be used only in the
definitive case of the determinative category (4.81). This means
that whenever a noun stem is used with one of these suffixes itwill also take a determining prefix (4.82 and 4.83).","[63, 64]"
"Similar examples are the following:
?4’man, tt'ri§ na’ ?and, ma’?an, 2a’hkis na’ 2k? thé, la'puhé, ?uni’kate'nt. (4a:g) “If I lie to the front and if you lie to the

10.13THEINTERROGATIVE-INDEFINITEPRONOUNSThe interrogative-indefinite pronouns are ka’ku “who, someone, anyone” and ka’nahku “what, something, anything.”’ The
former is a masculine singular but the latter is genderless and
numberless. They are used as substitutes for nouns with the following restrictions: (1) They do not occur in the locative case,
noun use no. 6, and (2) ka’nahku does not occur as independent
subject, noun use no. 2. Note also that when ka’nahku occurs as
independent object, the verb never takes an objective pronominal referential (see third example below). Examples:
ka’nahkiin.(11a:e) What is it?(< ka’nahku + -n, interrog.postf.; predicative word)ka’k sihpe Pun.(33:a) Someone has seen me.subj.)(ka’ku; indep.ka'na ra'p?dné (9:4) if I kill something (ka’na(hku) ; indep. obj.)

quantifiers such as ho’tu “all, everything’; na’mu “many, much”;
ka’ sku “‘a few, a little bit”; ka’Skuto’hku “several, quite a few”;
2a’mari “enough.” ! These words are used as follows:

10.4MopIFIEers10.41ADJECTIVESAdjectives may be used in the following ways:(1) as predicative words, e.g.,
S'htuna’ni(2)(8a:a) it was dark(< s¢’htuna dark + -a’ni)as modifiers of nouns used as predicative words, e.g.,
te’Caku, ku'wa lapo'nt. (43a:b) The crow woodpecker is a good
ey
(lapa'ni < la’pu good + -a’ni, modifying ku'wa
bird(3) as modifiers of the interrogative-indefinite pronoun ka’nahku
“something, anything,” e.g.,
ka’na la’pu yu'k?éné (4a:d) if I cook something good (la’pu,
modifying ka’nahku), but this usage may be a case ofidiomatic borrowing from the English expression ‘‘something good.”
As would be expected, adjectives are also used as modifiers ofnouns other than those used as predicative words (use no. 2
above), but in this event the adjective is incorporated in the
houn complex, i.e., stands between the noun and its gendersuffix when the latter is used. Such formations are structurally
identical with noun plus adjective composites (5.432), e.g.,
to’mahkami'liku (1) the red alligator (< t-, art. pref., + 20’mahka alligator + m2’lt red + -ku, Ms suff.)

predicative word, viz., la’puhé “it is good” (< la’pu good +a
suff. -hé of unknownconnotation).","[129, 130]"
". . .”” A more correct construction is found inni'hkiri'pin, ya’hk?arant (144:f) “I am giving a ball,”’ lit., “I am
making a ball,” wherein the verb stem ya’ ‘‘to do, make, commit”
is used in place of yu’wa in the former construction.
(3) &’htuna ki’éu (19:c) “in the dark.” Elsewhere the word
Si'htuna is used exclusively as an adjective; hence this phrase is
undoubtedly an attempt to translate the common English expression “‘in the dark.”
(4) ta’nehtali ma’su “to make the bed,” as in ta’nehtal ma’ Sutthé
(4a:g) “when she had made the bed.”’ The verb stem ma’Su normally means ‘‘to make” in the sense of ‘‘to build, construct.”
(5) ta’hkora ma'ri “to clear the table,’ as in ta’hkara ma’-rihk@ara’ni (4B:d) “she was clearing the table.”” Elsewhere ma’ri
means ‘‘to pick up.”
(6) te’tat?eh&i fu’ “to take the highway,” as in te’tet?éhé, cu’?uhke'ni (13:d) “he took the highway.”” The stem éu’ normally
means ‘“‘to take’”’ in the sense of “‘to take up, take hold of.”
(7) yo’'yani yu’wa “to give... work,” as in yo’yan wiyu’wantk?ahéd (13:j) “I shall give you work.”’ See remarks concerning yu’wa under ex. no. 2 above.
It will be noted that in some cases these borrowed idioms are
replacingTunicaidioms(e.g., nos.1 and2), whereasin othercases they represent attempts to render English expressions for
which there is no Tunica equivalent (nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7).",[87]
"In some cases the noun is fol-66HAASTUNICAlowed by the appropriate gender-suffix and in addition the verb of
the relative clause is followed by the same suffix, e.g.,

who were in the boat; to’ntse’ma the people < t- + ?0’nj
-++ -se’ma; ?u'k?erase’ma who were sitting < ?u’k?era they
were sitting + -se’maIn other cases, however, only the verb of the relative clause takes
a gender-number suffix, such suffix being omitted from the noun,
e.g.,
to'nt hi'p?ontase’man (5B:e) the people who had been dancing;
hi'p?ontase’ma who had been dancing < hz’p?onta they
had been dancing + -se’maSince the less than two dozen examples of this usage are about
evenly divided between the two procedures, it is not possible to
determine which is correct.
4.854.851THELOCATIVESUFFIXESThere are three locative suffixes used in the formationof the locative case (4.81). All nouns in this case also take a determining prefix (4.82 and 4.83). The gender-number suffixes andthe locative suffixes are mutually exclusive but the number of a
noun in the locative case may be singular or plural depending on
context. In addition to their use with nouns the locative suffixes
are widely used in forming postpositions and adverbs from post-positional stems(5.61 and 5.62) and in forming demonstrativeadverbs from demonstrative stems (5.7).","[64, 65]"

are derived from the static verb stem -ha’yi (4.71). These are
2uha'yi “the old man” (< “he is old’) and tiha’yi “the old
woman” (< “she is old’’); see 4.823.
Most interesting of all cases of implicit process, however, are
those in which inalienably possessed nouns used with the 3Mspronominal prefix havecometo be independent(i.e., non-pos-sessed) nouns by virtue of specialization as to meaning, e.g.,

so rarely that it has not been possible to assign a clearcut meaning
to it. Tentatively, a meaning ‘“‘to try to . . ., tried . . .-ing’’ has
been assumed for it. It may be related to the active verb stem po’
“to look, see’”’ but differs from it formally in being atonic. Examples:

the prior element. It is followed once by -tahk- (5.214) and once
by -hapa- (5.215):

probably related to the active verb stem ha’pa “‘to stop, quit,
cease, finish,” that -hila- “being about to, almost, nearly” (5.216)is possibly related to hz’la ‘‘to move,” and that -po- “to try to...,
tried . . .-ing’”’ (5.217) may be related to po’ ‘‘to look, see.’’ In
section 5.23 it is shown that two or more active verb stems may
be linked together, sometimes resulting in a specialization of mean-ing and sometimes not. In all probability it is through this process
of linking that the stems ha’pa, hi’la, and po’ have been worn
down to atonic suffixes with specialized meaning (5.231). It is, however, impossible to postulate a similar origin for the remaining
thematic suffixes. Here again, then, we have a distinction betweenthe restricted and the non-restricted suffixes, for it is only in the
case of the latter that we find a relationship to active verb stems.",[69]

"In their periphrastic usage,however, this aspect is expressed by placing a semelfactive form of
the auxiliary after a habitual theme (< an active verb stem + thehabitual thematic suffix -hk-, 5.213). This rule applies in the case
of all of the auxiliaries except ?u’hkz which, on its part, is never
used with a habitual theme.
When the auxiliaries are used in periphrastic inflection their
primary meanings are largely obscured. Certain ones of them are
used to express the secondary verbal categories which include thepast tense(4.532)and the immutableand mutableduratives(4.533). These categories are secondary for two reasons, (1) they
are not obligatory and (2) they cannot be expressed without the
inclusion of one of the primary categories. The special function of
each auxiliary when it is used in periphrasis is discussed in the
following sections.
4.5382 The auxiliary ?u’hki “he is, was’ (4.421) is regularly
employed to express the notion of priority in'time. It covers the
simple past, the present perfect, and the past perfect tenses of
English. Examples:
?unt'wihkt.(4a:v) you told him < ?uhk-, 3Ms pref., + nz’ totell + w2i’hki, 2ms smlf.

expressing the immutable durative either of the positionals may be
added to an unextended active verb stem or to any theme except
the habitual. In expressing the mutable durative, on the other
hand, either of the positionals must be added to a habitual theme.",[48]
"46HAASTUNICA(3) Alternative non-fusional conditionals for all of the auxilj.
aries may be constructed by the addition of the conditional post.fix -k?2 (9.33, no. 13) to their semelfactive forms. Such alternative
forms are used just as often as the fusional forms; hence a form
like wi'yak?1 “if you go” (< wi'ya, 2ms smlf. of ?u’wa, + -k?4)
occurs just as frequently as its equivalent fusional form wz’y?a.

which it is not possible to make a distinction between the two
types of stems except on the formal level, the terminology ‘‘noncausative” vs. ‘‘causative”’ is based on the following circumstance: Any non-causative intransitive stem may be transitivizedbybeing transferredcategory.fromthenon-causativeto thecausativeThus, to mention only one of numerous examples, wefind that ha’pa has the function of an intransitive stem meaning.

to stop, cease’? when it undergoes causative inflection.
(Other:
instances in which a given stem may be inflected in both categories
with a similar difference in meaning are provided in 5.212.)
In contrast to those cases in which there is a clearcut semantic
distinction between the non-causative and causative categories, it
is foundthat somestemsare alwaysinflected in the causativecategory even though their meanings do not reflect the notion of
causativity.","[44, 45]"
"All words occurring in phrase-final position appear as pause
forms in accordance with the rules given in 2.43. Words occurring

7.2SuMMARYREMARKSONSYNTACTICSTRUCTUREThe word-classes of Tunica are as follows: independent personal
pronouns, nouns, interrogative-indefinite pronouns, quantificatives, postpositions, adjectives, comparatives, adverbs, auxiliary
verbs, active verbs, static verbs, sentence connectives, and exclamatives and imitatives.",[88]
"Nouns in the indeterminative category or in the definitive case
of the determinative category are used in the following ways:
(1) as predicative words, e.g.,
?u'w Pone'nt(6c:a) he was a person(?one'ni < ?0'ni a per-son + -a’nt)
Puha'yikti. (13:g) It is the old man.(2) as independent subjects of predications, e.g.,

3s pref., + we’nz to find + -t¢ + -stuk?oha cannot, postf.,+ -a'niBut in a different context this same construction could mean ‘‘she
cannot find him.”’
In addition to the types of transimpersonalsdiscussedabovethere is evidence that stems denoting involuntary action (e.g.,
“to breathe”’; ‘‘to cough’’) were formerly used as transimpersonals.
The more usual procedure now is to treat such stems as intransitives. Note the following pairs of words given by the informant as
equivalents:

which is always transimpersonal, viz., hi’yu ‘“‘to wake up,” as in
thi'y?2okt (30) “I woke up.”
4.7TueINFLECTION4.71GENERALOFSTATICVERBSREMARKSStatic verb stems are inflected for person, gender, and number
by means of the inalienable pronominal prefixes and may not be
used without them (see 4.721 and 4.731). Hence they may not be
used as infinitives and in this respect differ markedly from active
verb stems (4.513).","[57, 58]"
"If the verb of the clause of indirect discourse is negativized the
element -k precedes the negative postfix -?aha (no. 18 below) and
such cases are not to be confused with the negative postfix -k?aha

negative postfix which is used in still other ways, viz., with nonirchoative forms of static verbs (4.74) and with independent
personal pronouns, nouns, and adjectives when these are used as
predicative words. Moreover, when a predicative noun is modified
by an adjective or when a non-inchoative static verb or a predicative adjective is modified by a comparative, the element -?aha is
attached to the adjective or to the comparative, as the case may
require. F-amples:

though it may not be employed in uses no. 1 and 4 above. When
used as a noun substitute (use no. 2 above) it takes either the ms
or the Fs gender-number suffix depending on the gender classification of the noun for which it is substituted,’ e.g.,
sa’ hiku, ti’hika& ?a’m?uhke'nt.(8a:d) The other went to thesouth. (sa’huku < sa’hu + -ku, Ms suff.; substituted for a
masc. noun; independent subject)sa'hihé, tiya'nakate'nt. (44:ax) She spoke to the other. (sa’huhci < sa’hu + -hét, Fs suff.; substituted for a fem. noun;
independent object)The word is also used as a noun modifier (use no. 3 above) and in
this event it is always incorporated within the noun complex like
an adjective, e.g.,
ta’ herit?esa'huhé, hana’ ?ake'ni.(228:c) The other boat stopped.(ta’herit?esa’huhti < ta’-, art. pref., + he’rit?e large boat
+ sa’hu + -hét)

and plural gender-number suffixes is not known but no such examples occur in
the available material.","[127, 128]"
"But inasmuch as the position of certain predicate modifiers is relatively free (rule 8 below), it sometimes happens that the independent subject follows a predicate modifier, e.g.,

before the predicative word. In such a case the independent object and the predicative word will often be included in the same
phrase, i.e., will not be separated by phrasing. Note also that the
independent object will normally follow the independent subject
if both are expressed in the same clause, e.g.,

"Fromthe English point ofview it is occasionally best rendered by “‘in, into” or “‘on, over.”
In the Tunica idiom, however, the meaning remains “at, to” and
it is not possible to substitute the postpositions kz’éu “in, into”’ or

cannot be denied that there are certain lacunae in this material,
most of these are to be interpreted as lacunae in his knowledge of
the language. Although the grammatical analysis of a dying language presents for this reason many problems and difficulties, I
have made every attempt to present the grammar of Tunica in thesame way that I would present that of a living language.

morphology and syntax is taken from my book Tunica Tezts.? The

melodyon their ultima,Pause forms have a phrase-finalor, in those cases where it is permitted(1.6), on their penultima, and many pause forms are indicated
only by means of their melody. Others, however, require some
sort of phonetic increment in addition to their melody.
All examples of Tunica words quoted in this grammar are pause
forms when their phrase-final melody is indicated (e.g., ha’rakatt
“‘she sings’’; ta’rustaku ““Rabbit”’; ka’tan ‘“‘where’’) while examples
quoted without a melody are context forms (e.g., ha’raka’ts “‘she
sings’; ta’rustaku ‘“‘Rabbit’’; ka’ta ‘“where’’).
2.42STRESSLOSSES ANDSHIFTS REQUIREDBY PAUSEFORMS2.421
Since all of the phrase-final melodies preclude a stress on
the ultima of the words with which they are used, special incremental pause forms are constructed for words which would otherwise have a stress on their ultima (2.48, rule 5).
2.422 In the case of words which take the rising and low
phrase-final melodies on their penultima (1.6), their penultimate
stress, if any, is lost, e.g.,
lo'‘hkatohku (9:i) a basket < la’hkato'hku
to'kasiku (4B:ad) the boy < to’kasi'ku2.423 The high and falling phrase-final melodies, which must
always be placed on the ultima, induce the loss of a penultimate
stress, e€.g.,2asdé (4B:a0) she is coming < ?a’sa
lo'takant (16:b) I (can) run < b’taka’ni
po?5n (4a:ax) look! < po’?9 you Fs look + -n, imperative postf.","[30, 31]"
"Hence a better understanding of the phoneticsof the language coupled with the great amount of new grammatical and text
material obtained from Youchigant has contributed much toward making pos-sible a fuller and more adequate analysis of the language.

freely used as the complement of any verb. In addition it is often
used as the complement of an active verb form built on the stem

literal meaning ‘‘to do in order to’), e.g.,

5.23THELINKINGOFACTIVEVERBSTEMS5.231
Two or more active verb stems having the same logical
subject are often linked together, the subjective inflection being
provided in connection with the last stem only. In all cases this
linkage constitutes a copulative construction ! comparable to the
copulative noun stem plus noun stem composites discussed in 5.433.
The events expressed by the different stems may be simultaneous or consecutive. If simultaneous, the stems may occur in anyorder, e.g.,
ha’raht' putthé (38: d) when she sang and danced; based on ha'ra
to sing + hi’pu to dance
tira’pape’k?uhke’nt. (9:1) He hit her and killed her; based on

10.6SENTENCECONNECTIVESSentence connectives include such words as hinya’tihé ‘‘now,
then, so, after that’’; hz’nahkuhé ‘“‘now, then, so, after that’ (used
interchangeably with hinya’tihé); hi’nahkuskan ‘‘nevertheless,

to’mahkaku the alligator < t- + ?9’mahka alligator + -kute’yuse'laku the opossum < t- + ?2’yuse'la opossum + -ku2.256 When § would come to stand before another §, one of
them is dropped. This rule applies in the case of stems ending in
§2 in circumstances which permit the syncopation of the 7 (2.242),

no'kusi’ male bear < no’kus(z) bear + sz’ male
ka’pasi' rooster < ka’pas(z) chicken + &’
2.26HAPLOLOGYAlthough instances of haplology are not common, the process is
found under the following circumstances: (1) When the last syllable of the prior member of a composite noun stem consists of k
plus a vowel, this syllable is dropped if the second member begins
in k,* e.g.,
te'rasko'ta cabbage < te’raski leaf -- ka'ta whitish, grayish
ha’hkiri cornmeal < ha'hka corn + ki'ri ground
rt hkora table < ri’hku wood + ko’ra disc-shaped
ri'hkora wagon,composedof the same elements as the aboveexcept that here the meaning implied is “that which is
characterized by having disc-shaped wood, 1.e., wheels’’(2) Noun stems beginning in ¢ usually omit the articular prefix
ta’- by haplology, e.g.,
te’teht?eku the river < ts'tiht?e river + -ku, ms suff.
to'rahkiku the ice < ta’rahki ice + -ku
But analogical reformationscontaining ta’- also occur, as in thecase of ta’titihi?eku and ta’tarahkiku which may be used in place of
1 This prefix is not to be confused with the agentive prefix ta’-. The latter always
appears in the form ta’- including the cases wherein it is used before a stem be-ginning in ?, e.g., ta’/?eru “laugher.”
2 Tn rare cases we find analogical reformations in which ta’- rather than ¢- is used
before stems beginning in ?, e.g., ta’?udehkato'nayihti (10:g) “Old Toad

8.18.11CLASSIFICATION
GENDER-NUMBERANDAGREEMENTCLASSIFICATIONOF NOUNSOn the formal level a noun must belong to one of sixgender-number classes: (1) masculine singular, (2) feminine singular, (3) masculine dual, (4) feminine dual, (5) masculine plural,
and (6) feminine plural. It is only when a noun is used in the de-finitive case (4.81) that its gender-number class is explicitly defined.",[101]
"The auxiliary verbs have the following unique characteristics:
(1) All of them exhibit the same general types of irregularities ininflection, namely, that certain forms are inflected like non-inchoative static verbs, others like non-causative active verbs in the
semelfactive aspect, while still others are unanalyzable. (2) Certain of these irregularities are occasioned by the use of supple-tion, a process not used by any other word-class of the language.
(3) Reduplication is regularly employed in the formation of their
repetitive paradigms, and, like suppletion, is not used elsewhere in
the language. (4) All of these verbs are employed in the periphrastic inflection of active verbs although all but one of them
may also be used independently.
Thecharacteristics of active verbs, which fall into two inflec-tional categories(non-causativeandcausative), are as follows:(1) Non-causatives are inflected(a)by suffixation, as exhibitedin the use of the semelfactive, habitual, and conditional sets of
endings, or (b) by juxtaposition, as exhibited in periphrastic constructions involving the auxiliary verbs. (2) Causatives are normally inflected only by juxtaposition. (3) Both types of verbs are
inflected for object by means of the alienable pronominal prefixes.
Static verbs exhibit the following inflectional traits: (1) Their
non-inchoative forms are constructed by means of the inalienable
pronominal prefixes which function on the grammatical level as
objects, on the interpretive level as subjects. (2) Their inchoative
forms are constructed by the use of certain active verb inflectional elements but at the same time retain the inalienable pronominal prefixes in the function just described.",[39]
"8.35 In the discussion devoted to the formation of active verb
duratives (4.533) it was pointed out that either of the two positional auxiliaries (?u’ra “‘he lies” or ?u’na “‘he sits’’) could be used.
Although the choice of auxiliary is in certain cases apparently
arbitrary, it is found to depend in large part on a combination of
the features of gender and position. The following rules apply in
too many cases to be considered a matter of accident:
(1) In the case of a single male animate subject whose position
is free, the auxiliary ?w’na is used if an erect or sitting position is
implied in connection with the activity involved, whereas the
auxiliary ?u’ra is used if a lying position is implied in connection
with the activity involved. Examples:
pi'tahk?una'nt(4a:b) he (a man) was walking alongta’ st?éku, we' sahk?una’ni.pa’ kan?una'ni.",[111]
"7.46 Adverbial clauses are ‘‘where”’ clauses or locative clauses.
These may modify the predicative word of either a main or a dendent clause.
‘‘Where” clauses contain the interrogativeindefinite adverb ka’ta (5.75) which may introduce the clause or
else be placed immediately before the verb. Such clauses also have
the subordinating postfix -hé attached to their verb, e.g.,
(Is:Mc)se’mdn,(Pw:Mc)?a’tane’ni,(pM: ac) ka’tén,(PW: Ac)?u'kika’tahé. (9:b) They came, it is said, (to the place)
where they camped.

(Ppw:pc) yu’katéhé (4B:k) when they got (to the place)
where the Stone Witch livedLocative clauses are distinguished by having the locative suffix
-§1 “‘at, to”’ attached to their predicative word (4.855), e.g.,
(1s: ac) ta’st?&ku,(pw: ac) ka’l?uras (pw:ipc) yu’kawithé (13:h)when he came up to the horse < to (where) the horse stood
7.5TasSyntactic
7.51ELEMENTSGENERALOFTHECLAUSEREMARKSThe syntactic elements of the clause are as follows: a predica-tive word, an independent subject, an independent object, a
subject or object modifier, a predicate modifier, a predicate complement, and a sentence connective. Every clause (except one
consisting of a quantificative, 10.21, or an exclamative or imitative,
10.7) must have a predicative word and may consist only of this
word. In addition to a predicative word a clause may contain anyof the remaining syntactic elements (except a subject or object
modifier) or any combination of these (including a subject or object modifier when the modified element is also present). In most
Cases the syntactic elements are words, but subject or object modi-fiersandpredicatecomplementsarewordsor clauses,whilePredicate modifiers are words, phrases, or clauses.
} In this case the predicate modifier consists of two words comprising a postpositional phrase (10:3).",[92]
"But in a few sporadic cases an hk group is retained before h, e.g.,
te’tehk(2) ho'tuéin (21:e) “the end of the bayou.” Exceptions occurring in the case of amalgamations are given in 2.34.
2.332Underrule(8) aboveit is providedthat a consonantgroup containing h plus a voiceless stop is dropped before a continuant. On the analogy of this regular rule we find that there
are a few cases wherein such a consonant group is likewise dropped
before a voiceless stop even though according to rule (2) the
should be retained,? e.g.,
ta’la(hé)(t) po’htuka'ni.

1 Instances of this sort are probably irregular. They usually involve (on the
morphological plane) the complete omission of the feminine singular gendersuffix (4.841) and it is difficult to determine whether this omission is the result
of a somewhat sweeping type of external sandhi or whether a morphological
error is involved. But note that the complete omission of the feminine singular
gender-suffix is also induced by the operation of rules (2) and (3) above.",[29]
"74HAASTUNICAtually synonymous stems are sometimes linked in order to make
more vivid the picture that is being portrayed, e.g., t’Slindhé,ta’yoronéa'hak ?uhk?o'nise’man, na'mu ri'kin sthko'héusa’kukate'ni
(4B:k) ‘The Stone Witch was devouring and eating too many of
the Tunica chief’s people” wherein sihko’héusa’kukate'ni is based
on ko’héu “to devour” + sa’ku “‘to eat.”
5.38StaticVersSTEMs5.381 In one instance it has been found that the thematic suffix
-hapa- (5.215) is added to an inchoativized static verb form (4.73),
viz.,
?uya' Sep?ake'ni.
(4B:br) he was already angry < had already got angry; based on -ya’sepa- < -ya’s& to be angry
+ -hapa-On the basis of this single example it is not possible to determine
whether such formations are legitimate or not. If they are, it
seems likely that they would require the verb to be of inchoative
form since -hapa- must be followed by an inflectional element.
5.32 What remains to be said about the formation of static
verb stems is concerned with petrified or non-productive formatives. We find that there are a few static verb stems beginning in
two consonants and that in most cases the first of these is § In
addition, a few of such stems appear to be related to certain active
verb stems, and, on the strength of this observation, it is assumed
that we have here an archaic prefix *-§(7)- which may at one time
have served the function of deriving static verb stems from active
verb stems. Note the following cases:
-sni'yu- to be lonesome; possibly related to the act. verb stemni'yu intr. to think
-§pi'tu- to get lost; possibly related to pz’tu trsimp. to get lost-Sru’ka to be afraid, scared, frightened;
ru’ka..c. tr. to frighten, scarepossibly related toFor other stems beginning in § plus a consonantwith active verb stems have been found.no connectionsThe prefix is set up as*.§(7)- rather than as *-§- because of such stems as -3?e’pa ‘“‘to behappy” which may be derived from *-%- + *-?a’pa, the trace of
the 7 being preserved in the presumably assimilated vowel e. Note
also -§?e’lama ‘“‘to be helpless” which may be <*-&i- + *-?a’lama.

by adding one of two derivative suffixes to a primary stem, 5.42;(2) thoseHANDBOOKOFformedthebyAMERICANINDIANjuxtapositionLANGUAGESof two75primarystems,5.43; (3) agentives, 5.44; and (4) those derived by implicit process, 5.45. It should also be noted that once a given type of secondary stem has been formed it may in its turn serve as the basis
for building other stems in the same way that a primary stem may(5.46).","[72, 73, 74]"
"The Ofo, Avoyelles, and Biloxi tribes are
oe’muteo4:ee |That Tunica has been remembered somewhat longer than the
other languages of the vicinity is a matter of accident. At present
it serves no sociological function whatsoever and when a language
has reached that stage it is to all intents and purposes a dead language. Hence it is to be assumed that what Youchigant recalls of
Tunica is at best a mere remnant of what the language must have
been when many speakers used it as their only means of communication. Indeed, I often had the feeling that the Tunica grooves in
Youchigant’s memory might be compared to the grooves in a
phonograph record; for he could repeat what he had heard but
was unable to make up new expressions of his own accord. He
himself is keenly aware of his deficiencies and often expressed his
regret that he so seldom heeded his mother when she reprimanded
him for speaking French instead of Tunica. He is also conscious
of the fact that his polylingualism interferes with his ability to recall Tunica.
Youchigant’s comments with respect to the speech of the “‘oldpeople’ deserve some attention.","[9, 10]"

There are, moreover, a few stems which, by virtue of the fact thatthey expressan event whichmustlogically succeedevents in the linkage, always take final position.the otherThe most widelyused of these are ho’tu ‘‘to finish, complete, end” and ha’pa “to
stop, quit, cease,” e.g.,
yu’ kiho'tusi'tthé (13:v) when they had finished cooking; based
on yu’ki to cook + ho’tu
wa'haha'pawthé (6a:b) when he quit weeping; based on wa’hato weep + ha'paIn connection with the last example note that it must have beenfrom such occurrences as these that the atonic thematic
-hapa- (see 5.219) was developed.
5.232suffixIn case an intransitive stem is linked with a transitivestem the pronominal prefix may be placed in front of either stem,
though it will ordinarily be placed in front of the transitive stem,
e.g.,
ya'k?iwa'&uhki. (4a:v) he came and fought me; based on
ya'ka to come + wa’ to fight, to which the 1s pref.
?thk- is attached
?uwe’ sata’p?ehkint. (30) I jumped and caught him; based on
we'sa to Jump + ta’p7 to catch, the 3ms pref. ?uhk- beingplaced before the intr. stem we’saIn case two transitive stems having the same logical object are
linked the pronominal prefix is used only with the first of them,e.g.,
Puxu'
ira’ p%ik?thé (4B:m) if you shoot him and kill him; based
on Su’ to shoot + ra’pa to kill, the 3s pref. ?uhk- serving
as the obj. of bothtira’ pape'k?uhke'ni. (9:1) He hit her and killed her; based on
ra'pa + pe’ka to hit, the 3rs pref. téhk- serving as the
obj. of both5.233 There are a few cases in which the linkage of active verb
stems results in a specialization of meaning and some of these have
become stereotyped or petrified in combination. The following
cases are the most important:(1) éu’ “to take” + ya’ka “to come”(or rarely, ya’ka + éu’)has the specialized meaning ‘“‘to bring to,” as in na’rdn,
yak?ik thé (148:a) “if you bring me a snake.”?ihéu'-HANDBOOKOFAMERICAN(2) hu’&, of unknown meaning,INDIANLANGUAGES73+ la’mz, perhaps ‘“‘to soften”’(cf. 5.5) has the meaning “to tan (hide),”’ as in hu’éila’mthk?ura’ni
(21:a) “he was tanning (hides).”
(3) ri’héu + to’wi or to'wi..c.' has the specialized meaning“to tie,” as in ka’tan, ?uri’héuto’wentahé (20:e) ‘where they tied
him.”","[71, 72]"
"Du. and PI.-?u'nimaPl.-se’ma, -sem-st’nima, -sinThe same feminine form (-sz’nima or -sin) is used both as a dualand as a plural. Note also that the dual and plural suffixes are
related to the independent personal pronouns ?u’nema (3MD),
si’nima (never *sin; 38FD-P), and se’ma (never *sem; 3MP), respectively (see 4.221). The function of the suffixes is, however, quitedistinct from that of the pronouns.
The alternative forms -sin (for -si’nima, FD-P) and -sem (for
-se’ma, MP) are irregularly apocopated atonic forms. The alterna-tive forms -ku‘hu (for -ku, Ms) and -hét’hi (for -hct, FS), on the other
hand, seem to have a special implication (see 4.842).
Examples of these suffixes (exclusive of the forms -ku’hu and
-héa’ht) are as follows:
ta’Cohdku (58:c) the chief < ta’- + ha
aria?",[64]
"(14B:p) Go! (< wi’ya you m go + -kz)Su'€%1ki.(4air) Shoot!hopi'2ikt. (4a:w) Come out!
2uya'lawi' tiki. (25:g) Let it loose!
In rare cases (perhaps incorrectly) -ki is followed by the imperative -n, e.g., 2iri’hé?ikin (14B:e) ‘Tie me!’ Note also that in thefirst telling of Text no. 4 the form ki’?umu’r?eki (4a:br) ‘Shove
him in!’ is employedwhereas in the second telling the form kz’-?umu’r2én (4B: bt), having the same meaning, is used in the same
situation. If any conclusion can be drawn from these two examples it is that the affective difference between -kz and -n is not very
great.(10) -héan, imperative postf., used only with the semelfactive
forms of auxiliary or active verbs. Since there is some reason to
think that -héan is used with a somewhat more persuasive forceHANDBOOKOFAMERICANINDIANLANGUAGES119than the other imperative postfixes, it is rendered as ‘must

of an auxiliary or active verb in only two cases, viz.,

the articular prefix giving the articularized form ta’hkara for both
stems.","[23, 24]"
"In all other cases -tan is used in connection with the negative postfix -?aha (no. 17 below) with the force of a prohibitive. Prohibitive forms are not inflected; in other words, -?aha + -tan (in this
order) are added directly to active verb infinitives, e.g.,
2uhpe'k?ahatan.",[118]
"Non-inflective affixes consist of the preverbsThe former indicate direction of movementand thewhile thelatter express a wider range of notions, including coordination,
Subordination, tense, and additional types of modality.
The word-classes of Tunica, which have been worked out
3.3On the basis of syntactic as well as inflectional considerations, are
as follows: the independent personal pronouns, nouns, the interrogative-indefinite pronouns, quantificatives, postpositions,36HAASTUNICAadjectives, comparatives, adverbs, the auxiliary verbs, active
verbs, static verbs, sentence connectives, and exclamatives andimitatives.","[34, 35]"
