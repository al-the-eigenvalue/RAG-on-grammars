"(Foundations of Language 7:70-118,Language Data Asian Pacific Series No. 1, 1971.)1971;A variety of analytical problems were met during the research
into Daga grammar, of which the following are typical:
(a) One of the analytical problems that arose was the treatment of
the suffix -wa which occurs on nominal and verbal forms (see 3.]).l2DAGAGRAMMARThe problem was complicated by the fact that it has different
functions according to its distribution on verbal forms.
Finally,
it was decided to describe all occurrences on nominal forms asthe Substantive Clitic and, in order to avoid confusion, to also
call it the Substantive Clitic when it occurs on verbal forms,
even though it has a variety of different functions on verbs
addition to the marking of a nominal construction.
(b)Relatedto the problemof the SubstantiveCliticwasinthe ho-mophony of the included clause verbal form and the past medial
verb (see 3.4.2.2).
The Substantive Clitic optionally occurs on
both of these homophonous forms.
On the included clause verbal
form it marks the construction as nominal, but on the past medial
verb it marks a change of subject or has various other functions.
It was decided that the included clause verbal form and the past
medial verb are distinct but homophonous forms.(c) A decision also had to be made on certain morphemesandfree forms, such as -a~ gapan, den, umap, and menan, as to
whether they were functioning on the phrase level as relators for
relator-axis phrases or on the clause level as tagmeme markers(see 3.1 (1), 3.2 8),and 3.3 (2)).","[19, 20]"

It is unusual to find a pronoun in the free

suffixes replace the free pronouns, but it does occur perhaps as
a way of highlighting the object or indirect object.",[52]

In such
cases the conjunction takes precedence and indicates the sentence
type.

Items of the periphery which optionally occur with any sentence
will be described first.
The sentences which are not shown on the

will then be described.
Each description will include the distinctive contrastive features of that particular sentence type followed by a bidimensional

A
double line separates surface structures from deep structures.
Unusual deep encodings occur below the single line in the bidimensional array.
The cross reference listed at the end of the unusual
encoding gives the more common surface structure for that particular deep structure.
Abbreviations and deep grammar symbols
used are described in the front of the paper.

the conclusions drawn are very tentative.
Further data should expand the exponents of the various tagmemes and refine the analySis.
7.1. Types of Linkage within the Paragraph.
Paragraphs,
except for embedded paragraphs, match the discourse-level tagmemes.
Thus lexical items marking a new discourse-level tagmeme also indicate a new paragraph.
Internally, the paragraph in Daga is held together by various
features: Recapitulation, Conjunctions, mismatch of phonological
and grammatical sentences, same subject, purposeful useage of
the same sentence type, use of referents, and juxtaposition.
(1) Recapitulation is of various types.
The final verb of the
previous sentence may be repeated exactly, repeated with a tense
change, or repeated with a change from final to medial form.
In
some cases additional tagmemes are recapitulated with the predi-291292DAGAGRAMMARcate.
Factors governing the choice of what is recapitulated are
not known at this time.
Recapitulation as a paragraph-internal cohesive factor is used
in all Discourse types except Epistolary Discourse, but is most
common in Narrative Discourse.
However, it is unusual to find
a paragraph that uses only recapitulation to bind the sentences
together.","[308, 309, 310]"
"Al-so the verb in the Indirect Quote Clause must be nominalized.

149150DAGAGRAMMARPhonologically, a sentence in Daga is marked by final falling
intonation with varying degrees of pause, except for the yes-no
interrogative which has a rising intonation finally.
Internally, the
intonation is level or dipping.
A contrastive study of intonation
patterns is needed.
Grammatically, the sentence is a combination of predications
and is held together by tense restrictions on tiie verbs and by other
restrictions on the exponents of the bases.
The medial-final distinction in the morphology of the verb exocenter is more important
in sentence constructions than the transitivity shown in the endocenter.
Optional conjunctions occur in several sentence types.
Recursion is common.
The bidimensional array of each sentence type will indicate those sentence types which have been
found expounding the bases of that particular sentence.
Further
data should reveal a greater range of exponents in most cases.
The examples will be listed according to their deep structure
and will follow the order of the deep structures as listed on the
bidimensional array.

The focus of this grammar is to present the levels of the
grammatical hierarchy as they are related to each other, starting with the word, progressing through phrase, clause, and sentence, and ending with discourse.
