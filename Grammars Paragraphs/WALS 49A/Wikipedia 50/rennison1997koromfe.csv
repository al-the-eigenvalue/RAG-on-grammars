"2.1.2.6.1.3 Class marking in interrogative pronouns
The class marking in the interrogative pronouns was described immediately above in §2.1.2.6.1.2.2 - i.e. there is nowhere near the richness of
the noun class system. §2.1.2.6.1.3.1-2 are therefore omitted. Since
Koromfe has no cases and no other grammatical categories are marked in
the interrogative pronouns, §2.1.2.6.1.4-5 are also omitted.",[298]

pronouns on the one hand, and the 'human', 'basic non-human' and
'diminutive' noun classes on the other.
The deictic naT)sa does not inflect. Cf. § 1.2.5.2.5.2 above for details of
the deictics.
2.1.1.10.2 The obligatory/optional status definiteness marking in the noun
phraseThe marking of definiteness in the noun phrase is normally obligatory if
the noun is definite. However, NPs qualified by possessive adjectives only
optionally take an NP-final definite determiner (e.g. ma b;yr;y and ma b;yr;y
hOT) both mean 'my friend'). Body parts can occur without a definite determiner even when no possessive adjective is used. An example is given
in (564) below, where a nEnt: 'a mouth' clearly belongs to the person referred to by the subject a fo 'a person'.
2.1.1.10.3 Variations in the form of the definiteness marker according to
the spatial relationshipsThe form of the definite article does not vary due to the spatial relationship between the entity concerned and participants in the speech act.
Rather, the long form is more strongly demonstrative or deictic (cf.
§2.1.1.10.1 above).
Since variation according to the spatial relationships does not occur,
§2. 1. 1.1 0.4 is inapplicable.
2.1.1.10.5 Where definiteness is and is not indicated
2.1.1.10.5 Proper namesDefiniteness can never be marked on proper names; not even the NPinitial, definiteness-neutral article a can be used with them. The only borderline case is names of languages, which take the article a, e.g. a friisdt:
'French'.","[269, 270]"
"259Morphology
2.1.2.5.5.1 Similarities with class and gender marking in the nounThe phonological shape of the demonstratives bear a strong phonological
resemblance to the 'human' ;Jiba, 'non-human' g011 and 'diminutive'
(singular only) ga noun classes (see (608) below).
2.1.2.5.5.2 Details o/the differences
It is not clear whether one should regard the demonstrative-pronoun usage
of the determiners as involving a class-like affix or not; if the first two
segments are considered to be a prefix, then the short forms have a 'stem'
consisting of a velar nasal [IJ] only - a very strange-looking stem for
Koromfe. The converse analysis is that the demonstratives have a pronoun-like stem,82 plus a suffix -g in the short forms and -gV in the long
forms (where V stands for a copy of the first vowel). The relevant forms
are given side by side in table (608) for comparison.

beginning (h in the human singular; k for 9 in the non-human and diminutive singular) and at the end (V).85 I cannot say whether or in what sense
speakers are 'conscious' of these correspondences.
Koromfe does not mark case and no further grammatical categories are
marked in the demonstrative, therefore §2.1.2.5.6-7 are omitted.
2.1.2.5.8 Use o/the demonstrative pronouns as demonstrative adjectivesAll 9 demonstrative pronouns given in (605) are used adjectivally. Some
examples are given in (609)-(611). In each case, the previous context in
the text forces a demonstrative reading of these determiners.","[294, 295]"
"2.1.2.7.1.2.2 Details o/the differences
The only singular-plural pair to which the number distinction is relevant,
ala, PL. bcnama, displays class suffixes which can be analysed as being
extremely close the sg. [a], PL. [ama] variant of the 'human' class :Jlba.
However, the word bcnama is not *bcnama (which would be the exact
phonological form required for this nominal sub-class), and obviously, its
stem is different from that of ala.
The word bEnama has a strong formal resemblance to the HUMAN
PLURAL determiner/demonstrative bEl]. However, since there are no other
comparable relative pronouns, speculations about the source of bcnama are
not going to lead very far.
There is no class distinction in the relative pronouns, there is no case
in the language, and no other grammatical categories marked are in the265Morphology
relative, and the relative pronouns cannot be used adjectivally - therefore
§2.1.2.7.1.3-5 are omitted.","[300, 301]"
"2.1.4.3.1.2 PersonThere is no distinction of person in the verbal or nominal adjectives,
though a verbal adjective can have a 1st or 2nd person subject alongside
the normal 3rd person, and a nominal adjective can qualify a 1st or 2nd
person (free, disjunctive) pronoun.
2.1.4.3.1.3 Class and genderThere is no marking for class in the verbal adjectives. Nominal adjectives,
like all other nouns, belong to a noun class and have the corresponding
singular and plural suffix. Participial adjectives (formally the UNMARKED
form of the verb - i.e. the bare verb stem) are indeclinable.
One nominal adjective, with the stem s:Jr- and the meaning 'other',
looks as if it inflects for humanness, since there exist two human forms
s:Jr:J (SG.) and s:Jraba (PL.) and also two non-human forms, s:Jragu (SG.)
and s:Jrahf (PL.). However, this is the only nominal adjective that I know
which marks humanness in this way, although there exist the interrogative
pronouns/adjectives ndeendI etc. and demonstratives ndendI and nandI
with this four-way distinction of number and humanness. The pattern of
s:Jr- is reminiscent of the deverbal agent and instrument nouns (i.e. with
288Morphology
HUM. SG. -5) in contrast with the personal pronouns and with ndendI and
nandI, which all have HUM. SG. dI.
The determiners, which can be used as demonstrative adjectives, also
agree with their head noun for number and humanness (cf. §2.1.1.1 0.1).2.1.4.3.1.4 <7ase
Koromfe has no case marking anywhere.","[323, 324]"
"ART. (optionally elided)korombA

the priest'This type of construction does not occur; the meaning 'I and NP' is always
expressed with the singular pronoun. Therefore §2.1.2.1.18.1 is inapplicable.
Koromfe also has no secondary pronoun system available by which it
is possible to specify in greater detail the precise composition of various
non-singular combinations of persons, therefore §2.1.2.1.19 is omitted.
2.1.2.1.20 Cases in pronounsKoromfe has no cases. The superficial phonetic differences between proclitic (subject and possessive) and postclitic (object) pronouns are purely
phonologically determined (cf. §2. 1.2. 1.1 0 above), therefore §2.1.2.1.20.1
and its subsections are inapplicable.
2.1.2.2 Reflexive pronouns
2.1.2.2.1 Reflexive pronoun vs. common nounFor the marking of reflexives the word gille 'self' is used following either
a proclitic or a free pronoun. This word looks for all the world like a singular noun of the dda noun class; but it has no plural. However, since
sentences such as (586) exist, where glUe has no proclitic pronoun but an
article a, this word must be a common noun. In any case, there is no reflexive pronoun like French se or German sich.

"1.2.5 Noun phrase (nominal constituent)
1.2.5.1 Operational definition for the noun phrase
Anything beginning with the article a is a noun phrase; there exists no
other morpheme in Koromfe with the shape a. The article a can only stand
at the beginning of an NP, no matter how complex that NP is (unless, of
course, it includes independent NPs within a subordinate clause).
Anything followed by a demonstrative adjective (cf. §1.2.5.2.5 below)
is an NP; that NP can be at any level within a complex NP (cf. §2.3.1.1 on
compound NPs).
1.2.5.2 Occurring types of modifier
Syntactic modifiers proper, apart from the article a or the possessive adjective, if present, always follow the noun which they modify; in morpho79Syntaxlogical compounding of nouns and NPs, on the other hand, the first member is the modifier of the second in genitival complex NPs and nouns (cf.
§2.3.1.1.1 and §2.3. 1. 1.3 below). Only the article a or a possessive adjective precede the noun. These two categories are in complementary distribution, and can only be present once in a simple NP.
1.2.5.2.1 AdjectiveNominal adjectives are morphologically very similar to nouns, and indeed
can be used as independent nouns, e.g. the adjective s:Jmdt: 'red', which is
used as a noun meaning 'white person'.
1.2.5.2.2 Relative clauseRelative clauses are described in § 1.1.2.3 above.
1.2.5.2.3 Possessive 'adjective'The (positive) personal pronouns, including the disjunctive ones, can all
be used as possessive30 adjective prefixes on a noun or NP. Here, they
have exactly the same morphological shape as the subject prefixes of
verbs. The possessive adjectives never occur anywhere except the initial
position of an NP. Only one possessive adjective can be present, and in
that case the NP cannot also have the article a. The article and the possessive adjective are the only prenominal modifiers of an NP.
1.2.5.2.4 ArticleThe article a occurs obligatorily before all common nouns which do not
have some other prenominal modifier (e.g. a possessive adjective or a
preceding noun or NP with which the it is compounded) or a postnominal
deictic, numeral or other modifier which precludes the use of the article.
Proper names and place names, on the other hand, never have the article a.
This situation is quite mystifying in comparison with the related language Moore (which many Koromfe speakers also speak), where almost
exactly the opposite holds: proper names (of persons) require a prefix [a]31
(except in vocative usage), while common nouns have none. Only place
names behave as in Koromfe, and have no article.
The Koromfe article a never inflects or changes in any way; phonologically it is optionally elided at a normal rate of speech after a non-high80Syntaxvowel. When no determiner is present, the article is indefinite, e.g. a b:Jr:J
'a man', a k£5 'a woman', a hem 'some water'.
Verbs, when named alone, take the form of the deverbal action noun,
which also requires an article. This means that a word list comprising the
open word classes noun, verb and adjective almost invariably produces a
list of Koromfe words which apparently all begin with a. However, this
article is an independent word and has no phonological effects whatsoever
on the following segments, even though intervocalic weakening processes
abound within words.
1.2.5.2.5 Demonstrative 'adjective'There are two types of demonstrative adjectives in Koromfe, which I have
labelled DETERMINER and DEICTIC in the glosses. The DETERMINER requires
the ARTICLE a or some other article-like nominal prefix which replaces the
article, such as a possessive adjective (for examples, see the next subsection).
1.2.5.2.5.1 DeterminerThe determiner inflects for number (singular or plural), humanness (human or non-human), or for diminutive (in which case the number must be
singular, and no humanness distinction is possible). For details of the inflectional forms, see §2.1.1.1 0.1.
Four32 of the five inflectional forms of the determiner also have a
'long' form, consisting of an additional (Le. second) syllable /gV/, where
V is a copy of the vowel of the first syllable. The short form of the determiner is very similar to the definite article in English, while the long form
is more akin to the English demonstratives this and that, though with less
deictic force than the deictics (see the next sub-section). Examples of long
forms are a b:Jr:J hoygo 'this/that man', a k£5 hoygo 'this/that woman', a
hem koygo 'this/that water'.
The determiner occurs at the end of a noun phrase, e.g. (in simple
noun phrases) a b:Jr:J hoy 'the man', a k£5 hoy 'the woman', a hem koy 'the
water'. When the noun phrase is complex, a sequence of two determiners
is avoided, as in (223) (where the determiner koy is expected after sundu)
or even when the determiners would be separated by a postposition, as in
(224) (where koy is expected after keko). Alternatively, the determiner of81Syntaxthe head noun is positioned before a relative clause, as bEl}ge in (225),
which allows the determiner hOl}go (which goes withJa) to be realized.

polite form of address). It can also be used alone in copular sentences such
as (226).

'This (one) is the ancestors' chicken.'","[114, 115, 116, 117]"
"2.1.2.3.4 Case in reciprocal pronounsThere is no case in Koromfe. Therefore §2.1.2.3 .4.1-2 are inapplicable.
§2.1.2.3.5 is answered in §2.1.2.3.1 above and is therefore omitted. There
are no other ways of expressing reciprocality, therefore §2.1.2.3.6 is inapplicable.
2.1.2.3.7 Other uses of the reciprocal pronounThe word dombtt also has its normal use as the plural form of the common
noun dono, PL. dombtt 'comrade', and is found quite frequently in that
usage. See §2.1.2.4.11.3.1 below for the only differences between the
nominal and reciprocal use of this word (though as a possessive reciprocal
and not as a pronoun). The word dombtt is also used as a reciprocal adjective (cf. §2.1.2.4.11.3.1 below).
2.1.2.4 Possessive pronouns
2.1.2.4.1 The occurrence ofpossessive pronounsThere is no set of possessive pronouns that is formally distinct from the
(free) personal pronouns. However, the personal pronouns can be used as253Morphologypossessive pronouns: the occurring forms are described in §2.1.2.4.3 below.
2.1.2.4.2 Types ofpossess ionAs with possession in general (cf. § 1.1 0 above), there is no distinction of
alienable/inalienable, temporary/permanent, persons/animals/things, present/past or any other in the possessed nouns in Koromfe, therefore
§2.1.2.4.2.1-5 are omitted.
2.1.2.4.3 The forms of the possessive pronounsThe possessive pronouns are exactly the same set of pronouns as the free
(disjunctive) personal pronouns described above in §2.1.2.1.1 and listed in
tables (565) and (573) above; they are therefore not repeated here.
The normal use of the possessive pronouns is exemplified by (595),
where ob 'ours' is the possessive pronoun.

§2.1.2.4.4-5 are inapplicable.
2.1.2.4.6 Alternative ways of expressing possession with pronounsAlternative construction is very often used (probably due to potential ambiguities with the personal pronoun) consisting of the word J51)go
'property' with a possessive adjective (prociitic or disjunctive), as shown
in (596). The corresponding sentence with a disjunctive possessive adjective has mab in place of ma.

"This phenomenon involving k5N is the only case of conjunction-NP
(or relative-NP) inversion that I know of in Koromfe. The relative order of
the clauses is irrelevant. A further example of this inversion is given in
(125). Note the similarity with the topicalized subject in (123), which
seems to be the source of this inversion.
The relative pronoun may not be within a pre-/postpositional phrase in
the relative clause (e.g. English/or whom or in which). This means that
(114) above is the only way to relativize a benefactive of a verb like 'give'
(which optionally takes the postposition ne).
1.1.2.3.6 Headless relative clausesHeadless relative clauses occur both with the non-specific, e.g. (120), and
the specific relative pronoun, e.g. (121).",[83]
"1.2.3.4 Restrictions on the modification ofadverbials byadverbials
It seems that only adverbials of degree and manner (including equative
usage) can modify other adverbials.
There exists one puzzling case. The deictic adverb nt:lJ 'thus' can be
modified by a NON-HUMAN SINGULAR DETERMINER, either kOlJ (short form)
or kOlJgo (long form), or by the NON-HUMAN SINGULAR DEICTIC nalJgu. This
is the only case I know of an adverb taking a DETERMINER or any other
kind of nominal modifier. An example is given in (215).",[111]
"2.1.2.1.11 Tense marking in the pronouns
Tense is not marked in the pronouns.
2.1.2.1.12 The marking of status distinctions in the pronoun
The plural is used in place of the singular in the 2nd and 3rd person to
convey 'respect' or 'politeness' (the terms used by my informants). Such
pronominal forms are used when speaking or referring, for example, to the
chief of a village or someone of even higher social status than the chief, or
when to God. Thus, for example, the sentence 'He has left.', when referring to the chief of the village, would normally be rendered as ba gondu
(lit. 'They have left.', with a 3pL. subject pronoun) rather than da gondu
(lit. 'He has left.', with a 3so. subject pronoun).
These plural pronouns are not used for normal conversational politeness (e.g. with a stranger of more-or-Iess equal status) in the way that
French vous or German Sie are; here the singular forms are always found.
It seems that the chief of the village is the lowest social rank for which the
plurals are used. 76
2.1.2.1.12.1 The use of titles or other nouns
The use of titles or other nouns instead of a pronoun is never obligatory.
Therefore §2.1.2.1.12.1.1-2 are inapplicable.
2.1.2.1.12.2 Different reference when forms from the neutral system are
used as status forms
The plurals pronouns, when used as polite forms with singular referent are
the only case in which forms of the neutral system acquire a different reference (cf. §2.1.2.1.12 above).",[281]

76Some of these words are similar to Moore words with a -gu singular; they may
therefore once have had a g which has been lost historically.
In Rennison (1986c) I give a more detailed account (with plentiful examples) of
the semantic characteristics of the 'human class' and the 'basic non-human class'.
The word saandre 'fatherhood', with a long aa, also seems to support this analysis,
and to indicate that the word 'father' itself was probably once saa, with a long
vowel, rather than present-day sa.
The notations '(2x)', '(3x)' etc. mean that the same gloss appears twice (3 times,
etc.) for different Koromfe words.
This seems to be a very recent development; one of the texts in my collection
contains ordinal numbers with the human singular suffix -;). Compare §2.1.6.4 below on the formation of the ordinal numerals.
The origin of the human 380. pronoun d<J/dI is unknown, but cannot in my opinion
be the de of the de/a noun class. Cf. the description of the personal pronouns in
§2.1.2.1.
Because of the small number of its members, nothing conclusive can be said about
the sub-type singular [lalJa] and plural [lao].
Apart from the ubiquitous -fj suffix which can be added to virtually any singular.
The word for 'chain', kerfe, is homophonous with the word for 'parrot'. My informants claim that his is purely accidental, and that there is no semantic link between
the two meanings.
One informant suggested that the collective is used for these sexual organs in order
to suggest ignorance of the precise details (which would be construed as polite and
respectful).
I was unable to elicit a long form from my informants, and none exists in my
Koromfe texts. However, I would not be at all surprised if a long diminutive singular form such as ke1Jge did exist.
Here the word kalm5 'old' (used only for humans) is used in the sense of
'deserving respect'. Note that it too has no determiner, and is therefore indefinite.
Apart from the subject NP, this is virtually a repetition of the second part of (561)
above; it is taken from the same text.
This 2nd person singular pronoun is used as a 'special anaphoric' pronoun for the
repeated 3rd person subject (cf. §1.5.2.2 above).
This 'dummy' stem b is phonetically similar to the adverb b which means 'in any
case'. However, it would be difficult to claim that the two are identical, since they
can co-occur, as in m<Jb b 'I, in any case' or 'as far as I'm concerned'.
The postclitic variants of the clitic pronouns must have a full vowel if phrase final;
the proclitic variants, on the other hand, never need a full vowel for phonological
reasons (though they may have one lexically, e.g. gu).
The free form is included here only for completeness' sake. It always consists of
the prefixal form plus the 'dummy' stem b.
On this point I have relied entirely on my informants' judgements, which is supported by the sparse cases of plurals in my texts. Prost (1980) reports the same usage, plus, he claims, the occasional use of the non-human singular gu referring to
'God'; this my informants categorically denied. However, this whole area is clearly
one in which further data from normal everyday speech would be of great benefit.","[401, 402]"

2.1.1. 7 Double case-markingKoromfe has no cases, therefore there is no double case marking as such
and §2.1.1. 7 .1-4 are inapplicable.
2.1.1.8.1 Number marking nouns
2.1.1.8.1.1 Singular/pluralThe basic number marking system (expressed by means of noun class
suffixes) is one of singular vs. plural. There is no dual, trial, paucal or
other system; therefore §2.1.1.8.1.2-5 are inapplicable. However, there
exist nouns whose 'basic' or less marked form is a collective 'plural', from
which a singulative can be formed.
Many of the diminutive nouns have a non-diminutive plural. In the
pronouns and deictics there exists a diminutive singular but not a diminutive plural form.
The 'default' plural suffix -ii, discussed in §2.1.1.8.7 in conjunction
with the plural of loan words, can always be used, if needed, to form a
plural from any singular noun, even if this involves double suffixation.
Such formations even occur in spontaneous speech when the speaker momentarily fails to access the correct plural form; usually my informants
corrected this spontaneous new plural when they repeated the sentence.
2.1.1.8.2 Obligatory status o/the number marking systemThe number marking system is obligatory because the noun class suffixes
are obligatory (except on the first noun of one unproductive type of compound noun, the N+N compound) and every noun class suffix expresses
number.
Since number marking exists §2.1.1.8.3 is inapplicable.
2.1.1.8.4 Collective vs. distributive pluralThere is no formal distinction between a collective and a distributive plural, and there are no words which have both kinds of 'plural'. The reasons
for assuming a morphological category 'collective' are a) formal and b)
semantic. The collectives all seem to have the same noun class suffix -/
(with automatic phonological variants), can form a singulative (see the
next section), and most of these nouns have similar semantics, i.e. animals
and other entities which are countable in principle, but normally occur in
'virtually uncountable' groups, e.g. mosquitoes, fish, ants, bees, cattle,
198Morphologyhair/feathers, rice, stars. Collectives are therefore also referred to as 'mass'
nouns in this grammar. (See the next section for a fuller listing of forms.)
2.1.1.8.5 Singulatives and non-collective pluralsSingulatives exist and are quite numerous. Non-collective plurals occur
only exceptionally (see below).
The normal singulative suffix is -fE. The singulative denotes a single
member of a large but in principle countable group which in most cases
has a COLLECTIVE plural as described in the previous section. Examples
(including exceptional forms) with the suffix -ft: are given in (525). I include the words duft: 'one' and wiIndafe 'finger': They are fairly rare alternatives for the words dom (or gad:Jm) 'one' and w5na hi 'finger' (lit.
'hand child'). The singulative suffix -fE is also the standard class suffix for
languages (of which koromfe is the only example in (525), but compare
also friisdE 'French' (derived fromjran9ais [fraseD and m:JsafE 'Moore'

'finger'Four nouns denoting (parts ot) fruit or vegetables"" have a special singulative or individuative suffix -Ire, a mass singular in -0, and an individuative plural in -ii, e.g. bsndakoire (SINGULAT.), bandako (MASS),
bandakofi (PLURAL) 'manioc'. See §2.1.1.9.1.2.5 for further details.
The nouns [boijfe] 'stake', [donfe] 'snake' and [saufe] 'rib' have a distinctive phonological shape (cf. their detailed description in §3.4.3.1.2
below, along with other [IJ]-[m] alternations) and denote long thin objects
which are not obviously collective (perhaps apart from 'ribs'). They may
perhaps be the remnants of aseparate noun class.
Any Koromfe noun can form a plural by adding -tt to the singular:
thus a singulative with the class suffix -ii: has a potential 'plural suffix'200Morphology
-fcli. However, these forms, although perfectly acceptable when formed ad
hoc, were rejected by my informants on later questioning.
The agreement of adjectives and reference by pronouns to the plurals
of the words in (525) is normally plural, but words such as miii 'rice'
which are more mass-like have singular agreement.","[231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236]"

1.1.2.3.4 Treatment of the element in the relative clause corresponding to
the head noun
The element in the relative clause corresponding to the head noun is replaced with a relative pronoun. There are two types of relative pronoun,
which I will term specific and non-specific. The SPECIFIC relative pronouns
are quite marginal: the two existing pronouns (ala SQ., bEnama PL.) are
restricted to human NPs. The singular is formally identical to the corresponding question word, but the plural question word, alama, bears no
resemblance to the corresponding relative pronoun bEnama. The NONSPECIFIC relative pronoun k5N is used in these and all other cases. Examples of specific relative pronouns are given in (111)-( 112) and their
equivalents with the non-specific relative pronoun in (114)-(115).","[80, 81]"
"2.1.4.6 Expression of the categories that characterize the verbal
morphology with predicative a4jectives
2.1.4.6.1 In the a4jective morphology
The 'categories that characterize the verbal morphology of the language'
are the four tense/aspect forms of the verb. These are never expressed on a
nominal adjective, but with verbal adjectives the question is quite difficult.
There is a considerable problem of elicitation in the area of verbal adjectives when using French (which has few verbal adjectives) as the
working language. In addition, Koromfe has nominal adjectives available
in most cases, and I found that informants often resorted to these when the
going got rough.
Nevertheless, I think that each true verbal adjective has only a single
morphological form, usually ending in long -aa like the PROGRESSIVE verb
forms and subject to the same shortening processes. The time reference of
such a verbal adjective is present unless modified by an adverb of time
(which can make it refer to past or future time). A list of most of the unequivocal verbal adjectives in my corpus is given in (667); words describing human body positions (sitting, standing, crouching, etc.) have
been omitted, since I consider these to be normal intransitive verbs. 106

'be small'One of the words in (667) deserves special mention, namely hana 'be

Whether this last form can be interpreted as a PAST tense verb form is un-293Morphologyclear to me; this seems to be the only verbal adjective that has two inflectional forms (apart from the shortening of long -aa).
2.1.4.6.2 By means of a copular verbWith nominal adjectives, the 'categories that characterize the verbal morphology of the language' are expressed by the same types of copular verb
described in § 1.2.1.1 above for the nouns and nominal adjectives
(especially § 1.2.1.1.2).
2.1.5 Prepositions/postpositions
2.1.5.1 Occurring formsAll prepositions (i.e. la and hal) and most of the common postpositions
were dealt with in §2.1.1 above; however, the class of postpositions seems
to be quite open to extension, since apart from the hard core of two
'postpositions proper' with no meaning as an independent noun, most of
the postpositions seem to have originated in common nouns. Table (674) is
therefore given with the proviso that new postpositions are very likely to
exist or to arise in the future.
There exist simple prepositions (la and hal) but no complex prepositions and (perhaps surprisingly) no complex postpositions with the structure la + X. In other words structure (668) is the only licit one for the
combination of a preposition with two nouns; structure (669) is impossible
(even with more preposition-like semantics of the second noun or with any
other variant of modifiers).

potentially large class). These common-noun postpositions can occur either alone or as a compound postposition with the structure X + nE. No
other preposition or postposition except nE is found in compound postpositions. The presence of nE in the more frequent common-noun postpositions could to a large extent be due to the influence of French: I noticed that the less educated a speaker was, or the less attention he paid to
these postpositions, the more likely he was to omit the nE of a compound
postposition. On the other hand, the formation and use of newer or less
frequent postpositions such as fura ni 'about' (lit.: 'on the track of')
seemed to require combination with nE (here phonetically ni). Also, when
the noun of the PP is omitted completely, or the noun of the PP is replaced
by a pronoun, nE is obligatory (cf. (671) and (672) respectively below,
both paraphrases of(673)).

94This 2nd person singular pronoun is used as a 'special anaphoric' pronoun for the
repeated 3rd person subject (cf. §1.5.2.2 above).
The 'intrusive' velar nasal here is slightly puzzling - cf. §2.1.6.6.1 below.
The non-human subject of this sentence refers to two animals. Here, they give one
another the signal to start their tug-of-war.
In this sentence m5 'also' implies that this is not the first story that was told.
I was unable to elicit a long form from my informants, and none exists in my
Koromfe texts. However, I would not be at all surprised if a long diminutive singular form such as kerjge did exist.
Historically this is probably the case, though it cannot be upheld synchronically.
The 3rd singular human pronoun is now dl, but was probably once :J
(corresponding to the singular of the :J/ba human noun class). In Moore the corresponding pronoun is a and the corresponding noun class is alba - i.e. the pronoun
and the noun class suffix are segmentally identical.
Compare also the HUMAN PLURAL relative pronoun benarna, which seems to have a
plural suffix -rna and a 'stem' ben which is very similar to the belJ of the determiner/demonstrative.
The form I is found in the noun class system proper (i.e. on simplex nouns), but he
is found on instrument nouns derived from verbs.
There is some degree of phonological naturalness about the distribution of h here,
since words beginning with vowels are rare and h alternates freely with zero in
words like alb I halb 'stranger'. The velar nasal, on the other hand, has no synchronic source and I cannot put my finger on a diachronic one, even taking into
consideration that it may be the reflex of go (cf. the -lJ singular variant of the gal!
noun class).
Of course, strictly speaking ase ni is not a separate question word, but simply a
variant of ase 'what'. For 'why' with a resultative rather than purposive meaning,
the construction ase la pa ke ... 'what gave (i.e. resulted in) (the fact) that...' is used.
The word given here as wa(lJ)katl occurs both with and without lJ. The vowel preceding lJ can also be nasal. This seems to be a case of speaker-specific free variation.
There also exists a causative verb hibs- from the same stem with the -s suffix.
The agent noun derived from this causative verb, holagr:J, is the normal term for
'midwife'.
The final vowels given in parentheses in some of the UNMARKED and DURATIVE
forms are fully harmonized and therefore, I claim, not lexically present. They
emerge phonetically in phrase-final position only. In all other positions either
schwa or nothing is heard, depending on context, tempo, casualness, etc. These
phonological processes are quite general for non-lexical vowels.
The environment 'after nasal consonants' is only applicable to the DURATIVE, since
UNMARKED forms with a nasal-final stem do not require an 'epenthetic' final
vowel.
The verb wufilln is the only one in my corpus with a stem-final f
Phonetically, the verb birg- sounds like [biriy-].
The stems are given here in their lexical form, i.e. with I-VII for all phonetic realizations, including -Vd and -Vn. See §3.1.2.1.4, §3.2.6.4.2 and §3.4.1.2 below for
justification of this phonological analysis.","[402, 403]"

2.1.1.9.5 The assignment of loan-words to noun classesThe assignment of loan words to noun classes was discussed in §2.1.1.8.7
above. Basically, nouns from closely related languages (which themselves
have phonetically similar noun classes) are taken over together with their
class suffixes, whilst all other words are lumped into the -Ii or -rna plural
classes.
Only types of fruit and vegetable and names of languages manage to
enter a native Koromfe noun class, namely the -it: singulative class, e.g.
(ATR disharmonic!) tornatft: (SINGULAT.), tornat! (COLL.) 'tomato' and
friisdt: '(the language) French'.
2.1.1.10 Definiteness in noun phrasesA definite NP is marked by a final determiner, as described below. There
is no special marking of an indefinite NP, apart from the fact that the
DETERMINER which marks a definite NP is missing. Both definite and indefinite NPs have an initial article a unless some other element precludes
the use of the article (cf. §1.2.5.2.4 above).
2.1.1.10.1 The marking of definitenessDefiniteness is marked with a separate word, which is located at the end of
the noun phrase (even after a relative clause, if need be). These words,
which I term DETERMINERS require the presence of the noun-phrase-initial
article a, or of some syntactic element (e.g. a possessive adjective) which
precludes the article a. The DETERMINERS are listed in (559). The long
form has more demonstrative or deictic force - cf. § 1.2.5.2.5.1 above.

in all syntactic positions in which any other noun phrase or clitic pronoun
can be used. There are also clitic pronouns (see §2.1.2.1.10 below). The
free pronouns (which I call 'DISJUNCTIVE PRONOUNS', abbreviated DISJ.
PRON. in glosses) have the same phonetic shape when used as subject,
direct object, indirect object or anything else. Formally, they are composed
of the clitic pronoun (as a prefix) followed by a stem b, which does not
occur as an independent noun in Koromfe. 73 Their forms are given in

2.1.2.1.1.1 Obligatory use offree pronounsThere is no case in which a free pronoun must obligatorily be used within
the basic elause structure involving a subject NP, verb and object NPs. In
cases where one of these NP is required for syntactic well-formedness
(e.g. as the subject of a sentence) a elitic pronoun can just as easily be
used.
When a pronoun is emphasized or topicalized (cf. § 1.11 and § 1.12
above respectively), only the free form and not the elitic can be used. In a
nutshell: a elitic pronoun can always be used when it has something to
eliticize to (i.e. a verb for the postclitics and a noun, verb or postposition
for the proclitics); otherwise a free pronoun must be used.
This holds for first, second and all types of third person (i.e.
§2.1.2.1.1.1.1-3, which are therefore omitted).
2.1.2.1.1.2 Optional use offree pronounsFree pronouns can always optionally be used in contexts where elitic pronoun could be used (barring the emphasized 2nd plural imperatives described in §2.1.2.1.1.3.3 below).
This holds for the first, second and all types of third person (i.e.
§2.1.2.1.1.2.1-3, which are therefore omitted).
2.1.2.1.1.3 Contexts in which free pronouns occur
2.1.2.1.1.3.1 Non-emphatic contexts in general
It is impossible to tell how emphatic the free pronouns are; my feeling isthat they can always be used, whether the context is emphatic or not; but
only the free pronouns can be used in emphatic contexts (i.e. a elitic pronoun cannot be stressed). Also, when used with the following reflexive
noun gIlI£ the free pronouns always seem to be emphasized (cf. §2.1.2.2
below.)
With postpositions the free pronoun seems hardly to be emphasized,
and it is quite typical in this position, e.g. mab wa 'at my house/place' (Fr.
chez moi) or mab n£ 'for me'. However, the proelitic pronouns can also be
used with postpositions, e.g. rna wa 'at my house/place' (Fr. chez moi) or
rna n£ 'for me'238Morphology
2.1.2.1.1.3.2 Contexts where the referent of the pronoun is emphasized
In contexts where the referent is emphasized the clitic pronouns cannot be
used and therefore the free pronouns are obligatory.","[272, 273, 274]"
"'Now that the new year has arrived, a person makes a sacrifice, he asks for
health and he asks for a (good) year. '2.1.2.1. 7.1 Clashes between natural gender and grammatical genderThere is no gender in the strict sense of male vs. female, but the humanness distinction can potentially lead to clashes, e.g. 'the man and his dog'
... 'they'. Here, the human 3rd person plural pronoun ba must be used; I
know of no case in which a non-human anaphoric pronoun is used. There
are no direct clashes of noun class because the class of a noun is never
reflected anywhere else (e.g. by agreement); only number and humanness
agree (cf. §2.1.4.3 on agreement between nouns and adjectives).
2.1.2.1.8 Class and gender distinctions in pronounsThere is no gender distinction of male vs. female in Koromfe, and no class
distinctions in the pronouns that parallel the rich variety of the class system in nouns. However, in the 3rd person pronouns both humanness (in
singular and plural) and diminutive (in the singular only) are distinguished. These distinctions of humanness and diminutiveness are entirely
semantic (not lexical) and therefore cut across the noun class system despite the fact that sometimes the same morphemes are involved. This
situation is particularly paradoxical in fables, where animals are referred
to by the human 3rd person pronouns del) and ba, but their noun class
suffixes are entirely non-human, e.g. jergtl rabbit (with the -ga diminutive
class suffix),jemde (with the -de suffix of the de/a class which contains no
nouns with human referents).
2.1.2.1.8.1 Sex of the speaker or hearerThe sex of the speaker or hearer is never formally distinguished in the
pronouns or elsewhere in the morphology. There are also no special pro243Morphology
nominal forms indicating the tribal, sectional, or family relationships of
the referents, speaker or hearer, therefore §2.1.2.1.9 is omitted.","[278, 279]"
"3.3.2 Stress
3.3.2.1 l'he role ojPstressStress plays no significant role in Koromfe. The phonetic manifestation of
word stress is quite weak, and there is never any noticeable change of the
position of stress within a phonological word. The only case in which
stress correlates with anything phonologically interesting is when vowels
of non-initial syllables are shortened when they are unstressed (see
§3.3.2.2.2 below).",[464]
"251Morphology
2.1.2.2.4 Case in reflexive pronounsCase is not marked at all in Koromfe, and not even the superficial phonetic
variation found in the clitic pronouns occurs with the reflexives. Therefore
§2.1.2.2.4.1-2 are inapplicable.
Since there exists a reflexive pronoun and there are no other ways of
expressing reflexivity §2.1.2.2.5-6 are inapplicable.
2.1.2.2.7 Other uses of the reflexive pronounThe reflexive pronouns are also used as reflexive possessive adjectives in
the sense 'my own X', 'your own X', etc. (cf. §2.1.2.4.11.2 below). The
forms with the free (disjunctive) variant of the personal pronoun are also
used emphatically and contrastively.
2.1.2.3 Reciprocal pronouns
2.1.2.3.1 Reciprocal pronoun vs. common noun as the reciprocalsThe plural form dombtt of the common noun dono 'comrade' is used as a
reciprocal pronoun. It can be used with any plural noun phrase, including
1st and 2nd person pronouns, and with plural imperatives.
Although the word dombtt is clearly a noun, it has one property which
sets it apart from true nouns: when used as a reciprocal possessive adjective it has no article or possessive adjective, which would be required with
a true common noun (see §2.1.2.4.11.3.1 below).
2.1.2.3.2 Subcategories distinguished in the reciprocalSince it is a noun, the reciprocal dombtt distinguishes no subcategories,
but stays dombtt in all usages. Note especially that although the word
dombtt has the morphological form 'stem + ba', where ba is the plural
suffix of the 'human' class ;)/ba, it never reflects the (non-)humanness of
its referents, as can be seen in examples (592}-{594) below.
Therefore §2.1.2.3.2.1-9 are inapplicable.
2.1.2.3.3 Examples of the reciprocal pronounSentence (592) illustrates the reciprocal dombtt as the indirect object of the
sentence. In (593) the understood object of the two verbs (namely the ends
of the two ropes) is not overtly expressed in the sentence, although the
reciprocal dombtt refers to it/them. Sentence (594) contains two occurrences of dombtt - the first being a reciprocal adjective in dombtt timsi
252Morphology'mutual fighting' and the second a reciprocal pronoun (as the direct object). In each of the examples (592)--(594), dombtt refers to nouns which
are not members of the 'human' class :J/ba.

135136In some instrument· nouns with ATR stems -hi is also found, e.g. sumbotrahi
'(bottle) openers' from sumbot- 'open'. However, -hi without ATR is not found.
Phonologically this behaviour parallels the locative postposition nt:, which can be
ne or ni with ATR, but never n1 without ATR.
The LOCATION noun derived with the suffix -fa can always be pluralized by the
addition of the 'default' plural suffix -Ii, producing in this case tufaftlfi 'seat (PL.)'
- a pattern which can be found with the DURATIVE stem of any verb for which a
plural LOCATION noun is semantically plausible.
The instrument plural suffix -hE comes closest to being unique to derived nouns,
but is also the suffixal clitic non-human plural pronoun.
Although I have not personally conducted a search, Manessy (1969) gives no
pronoun forms comparable to daldI for other Gur languages. In the related language Moore, where the noun class suffix is -a instead of -:J, there is complete
agreement between the underived human class suffix, the agent noun suffix and the
(short) clitic subject and object pronoun: all are a.
This gap is only on the content side, since formally there does exist a pronoun
suffix nt: (phonologically indistinguishable from n1 since high vowels frequently
lower to mid word-finally), which is the 2nd person singular postclitic pronoun.
This verb occurs only with a DURATIVE stem in my corpus - probably for semantic
reasons, since it denotes a more permanent kind of possession.
The derivation of such action nouns from verbs is also idiosyncratic in the related
local language Moore, but even more so: there is no regular derivation corresponding to Koromfe -am.
This verb is defective, having no other inflectional forms apart from the unmarked
form 1Jgo given here.
The plural with -Ii is given here only to indicate that it is also used for the concrete
reading of this noun. A plural in -Ii can always be formed from any singular noun
in Koromfe.
The base verb hom- has undergone semantic shift to a specific activity which generates heat. Compare the related words homnM (verbal adjective) 'be hot' and
homs- (verb, from Ihom+sl) 'heat'.
There also exists no verbal adjective *d:Jnamaa. Note also that the second d of
d:Jnda is arguably a verbal-adjective-forming suffix (cf. §2.2.2.2 below).
There exists no verbal adjective *p:Jtamaa (i.e. Ip:Jt+m+aa/ which ought to involve
the same intermediate stem as the derived noun p:Jtmle.
There is no nominal adjective, or indeed any other word, formed from this stem.
My informants expressed their intuition quite clearly that 'marry (a woman)' and
'plunder' were two facets of the same meaning. The other verb for 'marry (a
woman)' has the primary meaning 'pull (by the hand)'. The two verbs meaning
'marry (a man)' have the primary meanings 'return home (INTRANS.)' and 'take,
pick up'.
Only the PROGRESSIVE form has been omitted to save space; it exists for all and
only those verbs in (731) which have a DURATIVE form, and is formed by adding an
-aa suffix to the DURATIVE (and dropping the phrase-final vowel given in parentheses).","[405, 406]"

2.1.6.3 Numerals used for counting different kinds of objectsThere are no distinctions in the numerals used for counting different kinds
of objects. The class prefixes of the numerals from 1 to 9 are irrelevant in
this respect, and are invariant. In particular, there is no other reflex in the
numerals of the class system found in the nouns.
2.1.6.4 The formation of ordinal numeralsOrdinal numerals, apart from the word for 'first', are always formed regularly by the addition of the suffix -ndagu to the last word of the numeral
expression. The final vowel (e.g. of Ii '10') is usually lengthened in the
ordinal numeral, but that of [huru is not; the final vowel of the latter could
be a harmonized 'epenthetic schwa' (cf. §3.2.6.4.2.2), in which case this
behaviour is not surprising.
In the ordinal numerals the words for '2' up to '9' keep their class prefix [- when used alone, but lose it when used attributively if they immediately follow the noun, exactly like the cardinal numerals. All the simplex
ordinal numerals (not compounded with La) are given in (703), and some
examples of compound ones in (704). The method of compounding ill
ordinal numerals is exactly the same as in cardinal numerals.

however, gad:Jmandagu is used, and never pote; but gad:Jmandagu alone,
meaning 'first' is impossible.
When used attributively, the ordinal numerals are located in the usual
postnominal modifier position, as in (705). Ordinal numerals can also
stand alone, or (the more usual case) in a compound genitival NP (of the
type NP+N) with saa 'owner', as shown in (706). In this construction, saa

2.3.1 Compound nouns
Before considering the different categorial types of compound nouns, it is
important first to examine the morphological and syntactic properties of
the two structures which are available in Koromfe. The examples given
here are uniformly compounds with a genitival meaning involving two
nouns, but the structural properties described here are valid for all types of
compound NP.
First, let us consider the simpler case of the N+N compound noun.
This structure occupies the position in the NP which is otherwise occupied
by a single N (cf. §1.2.5.5 on the structure of the NP in Koromfe). The
resulting syntactic/morphological structure is given in (749). No daughter
noun of the N+N compound can branch further.

1.2.5.2.5.21)eicticThe modifier nand! (HUMAN SINGULAR), which inflects for number and
humanness, but not DIMINUTIVE, follows the noun phrase which it qualifies
and is referentially deictic (within the discourse), e.g. a b:JrJ nand! 'that
man (that we've just been talking about)"" a kEna namba 'those women'. It
requires an NP-initial article.
The deictic modifier na1Jsa is strongly deictic, and often accompanied
by some physical pointing or explanatory gesture. This modifier follows
the (rest of the) noun phrase to which it applies, and does not occur in
conjunction with relative clauses (or other intervening modifiers). It does
not normally allow an NP-initial article/ 3 and has a fixed (i.e. noninflected) phonological form, e.g. bJrJ na1Jsa 'that man over there', da1J
na1Jsa 'that house over there'. The lack of inflection seems to indicate that
the word na1Jsa may be an adverb, and therefore comparable to flE1Jgt:
'thus, like that', dealt with in §1.2.5.2.7 below.
1.2.5.2.6 QuantifiersQuantifiers follow the noun which they quantify in a position intermediate
between contentful adjectives (to the left of the quantifiers) and any
DETERMINER or DEICTIC that may be present (to their right). Numerals
precede other quantifiers. Some simpler examples, with universal quantification, are: e.g. a bJrJ doro 'every man', a benna doro 'all men', a kE5
doro 'every woman', a kEna doro 'all women'. The quantifier doro can
also be used with (clitic) pronouns, e.g. 0 doro 'all ofus'.
The zero quantifier is syntactically quite complex and also, incidentally, involves the only case of double negation in Koromfe. For countable
nouns, a noun phrase 'no X' usually has the structure baa X dom, where
baa is the (prenominal long variant of the) NEGATIVE PARTICLE 34 and dom
is the attributive CARDINAL NUMERAL 'one'. The verb is also negated
(either by repeating the NEGATIVE PARTICLE ba preverbally, or by the use of
a negative pronoun). Examples are given in (228)-(229).

1.12.2.2.5 More than one constituent simultaneouslySince topic NPs are left-dislocated, it is virtually a matter of opinion
whether one considers the sequence 'NP - pause - NP - pause sentence' to involve a single sentence with two topics or an elliptical first
sentence followed by a full second sentence.
1.12.2.3 Marking of the site from which movement of the topicalized NP
occurs
1.12.2.3.1 Marking with a copy of the topicalized elementThis happens only accidentally if the topicalized element happens to be a
pronoun.
1.12.2.3.2 Marking with a pro-form of the topicalized elementNormally the site from which the topicalized element was moved is
marked with the corresponding personal pronoun (usually the clitic form,
but optionally the disjunctive form).
1.12.2.3.3 Marking with a particleMarking with a particle does not occur.
1.12.2.3.4 No marking
If the topicalized NP originated as a constituent of the sentence, then its
source position must be marked with a pronoun. However, if the problem
cases in §1.11.2.2.1.1, examples (333)-(336) above, are analysed as topicalization rather than emphasis, then no marking of the source position of
the moved NP occurs.","[176, 177]"
"2.1.2.1.1.3.3 Non-emphatic contexts with imperative verbs
No pronoun normally occurs with unemphatic singular 2nd person imperatives. In plural 2nd person imperatives, the proclitic subject pronoun
na and the verb are inverted. However, inversion with the free 2nd plural
pronoun nab is impossible. This is the only case I know of in Koromfe
where a free pronoun is not interchangeable with the equivalent clitic
pronoun.",[274]

2.1.3.1.2.2 Formation of an intransitive verb from a transitive verb by not
specifying the direct objectThis process, if such it is, is the normal case in Koromfe. The direct object
is simply omitted without any change in the morphology.
2.1.3.1.2.3 Formation of a reciprocal intransitive verb by expressing both
subject and direct object of the transitive as subjectIn such sentences the direct object can be omitted altogether or replaced
by the reciprocal pronoun dombrt. In neither case does the verb morphology change.

2.1.3.1.3.1.1 Causative verbs from intransitive verbsSome intransitive verbs can be used causatively with no morphological
change. However, the suffixes -g, -s, -t and -Vm (where V is a harmonized
vowel) are also used to form causatives, as exemplified in (624).

to contain these suffixes, but which lack a non-causative form without the

causative vs. non-causative is not very consistent throughout the lexicon,
269Morphology
even though cases like those given in (624) are quite clear. Moreover,
these formations are so idiosyncratic that they are probably best considered to be derivational rather than inflectional.","[303, 304, 305]"
"2.1.1.8.6 The marking ofnumber distinctions in the nounNumber distinctions in the noun are marked by the noun class system,
which is described fully in §2.1.1.9 below.
2.1.1.8. 7 Number marking in foreign wordsForeign words in Koromfe, of which there are a fair number, came from at
least French, English (via other languages first), Arabic and Moore. I am
not in a position to judge whether there are any loans from Ful (Fulani,
Fulfulde, Peul) or other geographically close languages since my knowledge of them is too small; but there are no nouns apart from those dealt
with below which have obviously deviant noun class suffixes (which one
would expect, considering how words from Moore are integrated).
2.1.1.8.7.1 Nouns from European languages
It is difficult to tell via what route (and therefore, in what original shape)words from European languages entered Koromfe, especially since they
often came from languages with which no direct contact ever existed.
However, no word from a European language has kept its original number
marking. Most nouns from European languages are taken in their singular
shape and form their plural with the (highly productive) 'default' suffix-Ii
or (slightly less productively) with -mao However, if the noun can easily be
incorporated into a native or native-like (e.g. Moore-like) pattern, as with
fcnctn, where the phonetic [IT] looks like a Moore class suffix and so the
corresponding plural suffix [a(u)] is used.
Examples are given in (526).

Fr.jeune hommeOne word which retained its original plural, in a fossilized form with no
corresponding singular, is English match (for lighting a fire). In Koromfe
it has a singular form miiakesa or biiakesa, which already contains the
original plural s of matches, and a plural form with the suffix -n or -ma
(both of which are the typical, highly productive plural suffixes given to
foreign words), giving the forms miiakesan, miiakesama, biiakesan and
biiakesama. The nearest English-speaking area (probably Ghana) is a long
way from the area where Koromfe is spoken. The word also exists in
Moore as rruikjesblla (where blla is 'child (DIMIN.)'). In neither language
does a variant exist without the s of the original English plural.
Loan words from French potentially entered Koromfe more directly;
but not many French nouns have phonetically distinct singular and plural
forms, and I know of no such word which entered Koromfe.","[236, 237]"
"Phonology
293031323334353637383940414243Clearly, it is not always possible to tell whether what looks like an unanalysable
morphemic chunk really is one; and if it is (synchronically), whether it was one in
the near past. The data given here are what appear to be the clear cases.
The 'morphs' given here are not what I assume to be the lexical form of each
morpheme; only the position of the morpheme boundaries are relevant to the description of the diphthongs. The morpheme boundaries shown here are 'maximal',
i.e. at every position where such a boundary might possibly be considered to exist.
Since there exist no apparent cognates of this word, its morphological analysis
remains uncertain, though clearly the word must be complex if it is so long.
The word [wolle], PL. [wala] may combine the essence of both of these types of
phonetic variant; the [0] of the singular could be derived from I AI by both routes,
although in both cases the word is still irregular.
The term 'syllabic' for consonants, although widely used, is something of a misnomer, since the consonants involved are not always the whole syllable, but only
its nucleus. Therefore 'nuclear' consonants would be a better name. Having said
that, it turns out that all the nuclear consonants of Koromfe are indeed whole syllables; they have no (other) onset consonant or rimal consonant.
I am well aware that [""0/] and Ii] are equivalent to the vowels [5] and [i] respectively, but prefer this more complex transcription to preserve the parallel with the
other syllabic nasals.
Unfortunately there exist no morphemes with the phonetic shape [ng] or [lJg] which
could also be contrasted here.
Perhaps 'phrase-final' is a slightly misleading term, since any Koromfe word can
have its phrase-final realization in the middle of a sentence if it is followed by a
pause (e.g. in hesitations). The 'phrase' need not consist of more than one word; all
Koromfe word lists have the phrase-final realization of the word-final segments.
Clearly, the nasal variants [w] and [j] of Iwl and Ij/ respectively do not occur wordfinally because there is never a following word-initial nasal vowel that could nasalize them.
Here I ignore one non-native-Iooking adverb [faahan] 'up to now' and the conjunction and non-specific relative k5N - neither of which occur phrase-finally.
Since the syllabic vs. non-syllabic realizations of the 'syllabic nasals' are completely automatic, the syllabicity of phrase-initial nasals is not marked in the transcriptions in the rest of this grammar.
Since these consonant sequences are based only on the derived words contained in
my database, it is more than likely that a considerably larger number of sequences
actually occur.
The pseudo-underlying forms given here do not take syllable structure into account, and are given only for expository purposes.
Schwa is included here for completeness' sake, even though it is not a full vowel.
The word-initial sequence [mg] occurs only as a realization of the 1st person singular personal pronoun.
A single case of the word-initial sequence [no] exists with unlowered [0], namely
[nOIJ90], PL. [nom!] 'millstone'; but in the related verb [n5mam] 'pound' the expected post-nasal lowering and nasalization processes have taken place. Cf. also
§3.4 .l.1.1.1 on this word and these processes.","[497, 498]"
"353Morphology
2.3.1.1.5 Nouns derived from compound nounsThere exist a few abstract nouns such as jommadombre 'companionship,
friendship' and sabire 'consanguinity' which seem to be derived from the
compounds jommadono, PL. jommadombtl. 'companion, friend' and sa bi
'blood relative' (lit.: 'ancestors' child'). There exist no words *dombre or
*bire in isolation; on the contrary, the abstract noun from bi 'child' is bilei
'childhood' .
However, on the basis of the few forms that exist I would hesitate to
suggest that Koromfe can regularly derive abstract nouns from compound
nouns, even though the same suffix -de seems to be used with both. (Cf.
the discussion of these forms in §2.2. 1. 1. 1.1 above.)
2.3.1.2 Nounsfrom verbs (and verbal adjectives)The first member of a complex noun can be a verb: a bare (UNMARKED)
verb stem or what looks like the DURATIVE stem. This gives the structure
[V+N]N' There exists no parallel to the NP+N complex NP structure discussed above, since a verb stem cannot occupy the prenominal modifier
position of an NP. Also, there are no compounds in which a verbal adjective is used in place of a full verb. In addition, I claim that there are no
compound nouns with the reverse constituent structure N+V, though see
§2.2.1.1.1, §2.3. 1. 1.5 and §2.3.2.1 for some problematic borderline cases.
2.3.1.2.1 V+ N compound nouns formed with a bare verb stemCompounds formed with the bare verb stem are extremely rare compared
with N+N compounds, and arguably do not exist (but are actually N+N
compounds). There exist only a handful of cases in my corpus where a
bare verb stem is clearly identifiable and my informants said that the first
part of the compound was a verb. However, for each verb there is a corresponding deverbal action noun from which the first element of the compound noun could be derived - in which case these are plain N+N compound nouns. As with N+N compound nouns, the first member of these
compounds only has its bare stem with no trace of a suffix. The second
member (a noun) has its normal noun class suffix and inflects for number
just like the corresponding independent noun. Examples are given in
(773)-(775). The deverbal action nouns corresponding to the verbs hor'cook', nl- 'urinate' and dl- 'eat' are hortl.m, nEem or nED and dw respectively. I do not know why the first vowel of the verb nE is nasal but that of

analysed as N+N compounds where the first member is a deverbal agent
noun (which is formed from the DURATIVE stem of the verb - see
§2.2.1.2.0.1 above) and the noun class suffix is truncated. Some examples
are given in (776)-{778). The corresponding agent nouns are hEt;) 'person
who sews', jommo 'person who follows' and wollo 'person who fights'.

2.1.1.9.2.7 The m singular class
The nouns in this class are uncountable (and therefore have no plural).662.1.1.9.2.8 The fell singulativelcollective class
As its label 'singulative/collective' suggests, this class denotes nouns
which can be viewed as (small) individual members which make up a
mass-like group that is not easily countable. Some typical nouns of this
kind are the insects: 'ant, bee, fly, grasshopper, mosquito', the herd animals: 'cattle, fish' (though most herd animals are in other noun classes),
the things which grow in almost uncountable masses: 'bushes, creeping
plant, fruits (of various kinds), grass (of various kinds), hair, rice, tomatoes', and arguably also 'chain',67 'coin', 'pearl', 'star'. Some words have
no collective form because these are either semantically inappropriate (e.g.
'one' and names of languages) or are expressed by other nouns (e.g.
'finger').
Nevertheless, there remain a few puzzling words: the animals 'parrot,
snake', which are not particularly herd-oriented, the long-thin objects 'rib,
stake' (which might form a semantic sub-group together with the equally
long-thin types of grass, and with 'snake', for which the secret word is
'(blade of) grass'), and the sexual organs 'testicle, vagina' .682.1.1.9.3 Noun class marking on words other than nouns and nominal
adjectives
The noun classes are marked on the noun, are similar to the 3rd person
pronouns, and are also marked on some deictic adjectives and also arguably on numerals. These aspects of the noun class system are dealt with in
their respective sections of this chapter.
Noun classes are not marked on verbs, although the 3rd person short
pronouns resemble the human, non-human and diminutive class suffixes,
both in subject (=preverbal) and object (=postverbal) position. However,
these morphemes are clearly pronouns rather than noun class agreement
markers, since they do not appear when there is an overt subject or object
noun phrase.","[267, 268]"
"1.2.1.2.4 Other kinds a/arguments a/verbs
Apart from temporal and local adverbials, Koromfe has benefactive
(optionally), comitative (optionally) and instrumental (optionally) arguments. The benefactive is expressed by the postposition ne (exemplified in
the previous subsection), and the comitative and instrumental are both
expressed with the preposition lao It is difficult to construct a sentence in
which comitative and instrumental co-occur.
70Syntax
1.2.1.2.5 Combinations of subject, direct object, indirect object, and other
argumentsKoromfe sentences require a subject, but are quite free in allowing (or
allowing the omission of) all other verb arguments. In example (197)
above we saw that a verb such as 'give' does not require a direct object
even when an indirect object and benefactive are present (unlike English).
I would go as far as to say that any semantically and pragmatically feasible
combination of verb arguments is permissible in Koromfe (pace the
obligatory status of the subject). In example (4) at the beginning of this
chapter, the final word pa 'give' has no overt object of any kind.
Since the order of the constituents for the combination of verb, subject, and direct object is given in the relevant sections above, § 1.2.1.2.6 is
omitted.
1.2.1.3 Adverbials
1.2.1.3.1 Occurring and non-occurring types ofadverbial
1.2.1.3.1.1 AdverbsAdverbs occur, but they are only a small lexical class, since there is no
class of adjectives from which they might be derived (as in English). Instead, there are nominal or verbal adjectives, neither of which permits the
formation of or use as an adverb. Also, there is no clear boundary between
adverbs and exclamations (including phonologically irregular elements).
Many adverbs, particularly of manner, are typically repeated (sometimes
more than once), such as b:JI b:JI 'slowly', sene sene 'at the bottom', tau tau
'fast', wele wele 'fast'. (Cf. §2.2.4.4 below on reduplication.)
1.2.1.3.1.2 Prepositional or postpositional phrasesBoth occur. Prepositions are the more restricted class, being limited to la
'with' (COMITATNE and INSTRUMENTAL) and hal 'up to, as far as' .
1.2.1.3.1.3 Cases of noun phrasesKoromfe has no cases. However, the universally quantified adverbs tike
duru 'everywhere' and s55ne duru 'always, every time' are plain noun
phrases (comprising the nouns tike 'place + SG.' and s55ne 'time + SG.'
plus the quantifier duru 'all') with no pre- or postposition. Other temporal
adverbials derived from noun phrases, which normally take the preposition
71Syntax
la, may optionally omit this preposition; local adverbials, on the other
hand, always keep their postposition.
1.2.1.3.1.4 Adverbial clausesFinite adverbial clauses occur, and are described in § 1.1.2.4.2 above. Nonfinite adverbial clauses also occur, and are restricted to PPs containing
gerunds or deverbal action nouns. They are described in § 1.1.2.4.3 above.
1.2.1.3.2 The positional possibilities for adverbials within the sentence
1.2.1.3.2.1 AdverbsAdverbs fall into three distinct classes on distributional grounds, and each
class has related semantic characteristics. (Note that clause-final in the
following sub-sections excludes the sentence-final yes-no question particles, which are always the very last thing in a sentence.)
1.2.1.3.2.1.1 Pre-verbal verbal adverbsThis class of adverbs includes the adverbs da 'in the past', handa 'truly' ,28
and occurs before the (first) finite verb of a clause (with the exception of
handa when used as an exclamation outside normal sentence structure cf. the pre-sentential echo-question usage of handa in § 1.1.1.2.3.3 above).
This is also the position where the negative particle ba occurs when it
qualifies the verb. In the rare event that more than one of these co-occur,
they have the order handa - da - ba.
Sentence (201) below contains an example of da. The adverb handa is
exemplified in (200).

"Otherwise, I know of no morphological processes which regularly affect strings of verbs.
2.1.4 Adjectives
Koromfe has a class of nouns which, roughly speaking, cover a range of
meanings expressed in languages like English by adjectives, and a class of
verbs which cover meanings expressed in English by 'be X', where X is an
adjective. I term these sub-classes of nouns and verbs 'nominal adjectives'
and 'verbal adjectives' respectively, but in fact formally, with the very few
exceptions which I will mention below, nothing distinguishes these
'adjectives' from full verbs or nouns respectively.
In addition, the UNMARKED form of many verbs can be used participially as an attributive adjective (with either an active or passive reading).
These participial adjectives cannot be used predicatively (see §2.1.4.3.1.1
below for details).",[320]
"The words d:Jl and d:Jlmee both mean length and can be used interchangeably; I
have found no context in which they contrast in any way.
lOS
This holds even bearing in mind that morphologically there is no distinction between the 'adjective' d:J:Jrt' and the 'noun' b:Jr:J. For here, it is not 'masculinity'
that is 'measured', but rather some attribute of a 'man'. Incidentally, b:Jr:J is frequently used as an adjective meaning 'male' in kinship terminology - cf. §5.1.1
below.
106 There also exists a form kebe meaning 'be large'. It looks as if it ought to be a PAST
form of verb keb- 'grow', but such a verb does not exist; instead we find keb+s'grow', with an -s suffix. Compare also the nominal adjective kebre, PL. kebitt
'big'.
107 The variation in the length of the final a's is identical to that found in the PROGRESSIVE forms of verbs, and is phonologically automatic. The verbal adjectives
given here with a short a only are those for which I omitted to elicit a phrase-final
form (which, I am sure, would have a long aa).

1.11.3 Focus of a yes-no questionI have never found nor been able to elicit a focused yes-no question, even
though my suspicion is it ought to be possible to stick a yes-no question
particle on the end of any sentence whatsoever. However, it is possible to
use a yes-no question immediately following a topic NP, as in (365).

2.1.8.3 The relative order of cliticsThere is only one case in which clitics regularly occur adjacent to one
another: in sentences with a direct and indirect object. Both types of object
can be expressed by a suffixal clitic pronoun. In this case, as described and
exemplified in § 1.2.1.2.3 above, the indirect object clitic precedes the
direct object clitic. However, if either of the objects is a full NP, then the
clitic object comes first. Thus the precedence rules for postverbal objects
are:
1. Clitic pronouns before full NPs, then
2. Indirect objects before direct objects, provided that 1. is not violated.
2.1.8.4 Restrictions on possible combinations of cliricsThere are no formal restrictions on the possible combinations of clitic
pronouns, so long as the sentence makes sense semantically. Therefore
§2.1.8.5 is inapplicable.","[350, 351]"
"429Phonology
3.3.2.2 The phonetic correlates of stress
3.3.2.2.1 Word stressIn general, a stressed syllable is louder than an unstressed syllable. Word
stress is not expressed by pitch changes; these indicate phrasal stress or
the intonational peak. Stress is always located on the first syllable of a
word. The pitch pattern of a phrasally or intonationally stressed word is
usually rising from the first to the second syllable, then falling, so that the
highest pitch of the phrase or intonation pattern is the second syllable of
the stressed word.
However, the difference in amplitude and tone between, say the two
syllables of the word [gote] 'stream' is minimal. In word lists the informants sometimes strike up a 'slight fall' tone pattern with roughly equal
amplitude, or sometimes a 'slight rise' pattern accompanied by a slight
drop in amplitude. Syllables containing schwa are considerably weaker
than full vowel syllables.
3.3.2.2.2 Phrase stressOn the phrase level, there is maximally a single stress which can be assigned to a noun phrase or an adverb-verb group,63 both for normal and for
contrastive stressing. This phrasal stress is expressed by a high tone on the
final full-vowel syllable of the first stressable word in the phrase.
A negative marker, if present, always receives the stress of the adverbverb group, expressed as a higher tone. This means that if the verb is a
PROGRESSIVE form or verbal adjective with a final long faa!, this is shortened to a single short [a].
Typically, nouns, verbs, adjectives (of both types) or adverbs carry
phrasal stress, but other word types, i.e. the 'grammatical' words (apart
from the sentence-final yes-no question particles) do not. Proclitic weak
pronouns are not stressable, but strong (disjunctive) pronouns with the
'dummy' word stem -b are. The article a which precedes almost every
word of a word list has a considerably lower amplitude and lower tone
than the following noun. Post-nominal DETERMINERS or DEICTICS such as
h01J (HUM. SG.) are also quieter and on a lower tone than the noun which
they qualify. Conjunctions and relative pronouns introducing a subordinate
clause are never stressed.
In all types of complex NP the first element normally receives the
phrasal stress (higher tone) - unless some other part of the compound is
430Phonology
contrastively stressed. This seems to be responsible for the shortening of
the word saa 'owner' to [sa] when it is the second element of a compound
NP.
3.3.2.3 Levels o/stress
For both words and phrases there are no phonologically relevant levels of
stress above and beyond the distinction of stressed and unstressed (for full
vowels) and that of full (i.e. potentially stressable) vs. schwa (i.e. unstressable) vowels at the word level. Of course, phonetically the pattern of
sharp pitch rises and gradual falls produces an almost infinite number of
pitches.
3.3.2.4 The position o/stress when constant
The position of stress is constant at the word level: on the first syllable of
the word.
3.3.2.5 The position 0/ stress when mobile
At the phrase level the position of stress (expressed by a single high tone)
is constant as described in §3.3.2.2 above unless any word in the phrase is
contrastively stressed (in which case it receives the high tone).
3.3.2.6 Exceptional stress patterns in loan-words
The stress pattern of loans form Moore is identical to that of native
Koromfe word~.
However, loans from French, especially when used by
However,
more educated speakers, seem to have longer and (slightly) louder final
syllables than native Koromfe words. Nevertheless, the difference m
prominence between the individual full-vowel syllables is quite small.
3.3.3 PitchPitch is not used to distinguish lexical items, and Koromfe has no linguistic tones of any kind. This point is very important because most related
languages do have linguistic tones: Moore, for example, has two register
tones and automatic downstep (cf. Rennison, 1987c). However, I have
checked this point repeatedly and even went to the trouble of learning to
hear the tones of Moore and analysing its tone system. Koromfe definitely
has no linguistic tones.","[464, 465, 466]"
"Comparison is not only weakly represented in the grammar of
Koromfe; there are even cases where the whole notion of comparison is
omitted when it would be expressed in a language like English. In the
fable of the elephant, the hippopotamus and the rabbit the trick used by the
rabbit is to persuade the other two animals that their children will grow to
be bigger if brought up in/outside the water. However, the notion of
growing to be 'bigger than they would otherwise grow' is nowhere overtly
expressed. Instead, the rabbit simply states the 'he will grow', as shown in

\31415The availability of this paraphrase shows that 'generosity' is expressed in Koromfe
by the semantics of 'white stomach' and not by an opaque or fossilized noun or(a)
p5namll. Nevertheless, none of my informants could tell me what generosity has to
do with the colour of one's stomach.
It is typical for measurements of this kind to consist mainly of loan words ('ton'
and 'lorry' both come from French).
Another logically possible analysis is that the PP superset is an adverbial. However, this would allow for some other NP to be the topic of the sentence; but such
sentences do not exist.
The noun wakIn, PL. wakla is the name of a coin worth 5 francs in present-day
currency; it is countable; mane 'money' is not, although it can form a singulative
manafe 'coin'.
I do not know why a genitival NP+N compound NP cannot be used to express
extent, parallel to the expressions of quantity in §2.1.1.4.9.
In this monograph I have not always used the citation forms for words presented in
isolation for reasons of presentation - and to save space.
The usage for bodies of water may result from the fact that water is scarce and is
often stored in reservoirs which have dams; in other words 'foot' is used here in
the same way as English at the foot of a mountain where the noun is considered
higher than the position denoted.
However, I must admit that I was unable to construct a usable scenario to elicit the
semantics 'past with superior contact'. A bird's touch-and-go landing on a roof met
with no success.
Here, as with hErga, the notion of going 'to (a position) alongside the water' can
only be expressed by the use of the general postposition ne for 'to the water' plus a
second clause expressing laterality.
Souleymane points out that this sentence could also mean that the wall falls over.
The finalla of the postposition d:Jlla is a mystery insofar as one would expect that
d:Jl alone could be used (following the pattern of the other noun-derived postpositions). The extra la cannot be an emphatic particle because a) it is not in a permissible position, and b) it is obligatory with this postposition.
Here the N stands for either a) a homorganic nasal stop before an obstruent, or b)
zero before a glide G,w,h), or c) [n], [n:l] or even [n5] before a nasal stop.
There is a set of full borrowings, i.e. phonetically adapted version of Fr. une heure,
deux heures, etc., and a single-word borrowing leen, PL. leerama 'hour, o'clock'
from Fr. ['heure, which takes a postposed Koromfe cardinal numeral to form times
of day (and therefore is interchangeable with indigenous wakatl, PL. wakatama).
The front rounded vowels transcribed here represent a very correct, high-prestige
pronunciation using sounds that do not conform to the Koromfe phonological system. A (less prestigious) conforming pronunciation has [w] for [q], [£] for [re] and
[i]for[y].
In this context, the a might be (a remnant of) the French preposition rather than
the article.a363Morphology

242526272829The word te is also open to interpretation as tl 'make' merged with the article a
(whereby expected la is realized phonetically as e by a quite general phonological
process of Koromfe).
There are many different forms of the words which I have written here as Moore
and Mossi and none are adequate in all respects. This choice of spelling has no
motivation other than convenience, and it not intended to support or criticize any
school of thought, linguistic or otherwise. In fact, I believe that the transcription
[mo:se] is misleading insofar as both vowels are 'phonemically' lax high vowels
and not tense mid ones (cf. Rennison, 1987c; 1992).
These words are probably areal terms used in several languages, because most of
them are either identical or very similar in Moore.
I suspect that this word has a multiple source. If it is French, it carmot easily be the
word chandelle or chandelier, since the source sound U1 ought to be rendered as
[s] in Koromfe (cf. [3] to [z] in [zemm] from [3remm] jeune homme). If it is Fr.
candelabre, then truncation has occurred.
This word must have entered Koromfe via Moore because its plural suffix is one
which (otherwise) is found only with Moore loans. See §2.1.1.8.7.3 for details.
Unfortunately, my knowledge of Arabic is inadequate to attempt any etymologies.
I have been unable to ascertain the local (Yadre) Moore phonetic forms of these
words, in particular their tones. However, the phonetic quality of the segments
which I have been able to compare is identical in Moore. Recall that the majority
of Koromfe speakers also speak Moore fluently.
This word originally came from English motor car. Cf. §2.1.1.8.7.l above.
There is a restriction on the vowels of class suffixes in Moore to the 3 peripheral
colours (i,u,a); mid vowels do not occur. (The vowels transcribed as phonetic [e]
and [0] are phonologically lax high vowels - cf. Rennison 1987c.)
This statement may be marginally violated, depending on one's phonological
analysis, by the [mmii] variant of the alma sub-type of the olba class (e.g. sa, PL.
samma 'father'), and by the [laga] (SG.) / [lao] sub-type of the 'diminutive' galm
class; cf. §2.1.1.9.1.1.2 and §2. 1. 1.9.1.4.3 respectively.
The word ka1J 'thing', PL. Mama looks as if the singular may have a nasalized -go
suffix (like da1J 'house', PL. da7) and perhaps a -ma plural suffix. However, the alternation of the initial k with h is unique in Koromfe, and the additional a of the
plural form is also idiosyncratic.
In Moore, on the other hand, the human class suffixes are identical with the personal pronouns both in the plural (ba) and the singular (a). The similarity with the
Koromfe class suffixes is striking; recall that a suffix -.J would be impossible in
Moore because of the general ban on mid vowels in suffixes.
The words alb and an.J are two of a handful of words in Koromfe (most of them
loans from Arabic) that begin with a vowel; the variants with an initial consonant
are clearly attempts to rectify this irregularity. I do not know the historical source
of these two words, but the I in an.J which disappears in the plural is highly unusual.
The words buno and s.Jb.J are the only words in Koromfe where one might claim
that the corresponding verbs with the stems (bunon and s.Jb.J1 respectively) are derived from the nouns by the addition of an -I suffix; alternatively, the nouns might364Morphology30313233343536373839404142434445be participles (UNMARKED verb fonns) which have (irregularly) acquired a plural.
Either way, the fonnation is rare and limited to these two words.
Whether the ethnic group 'Berba' is the same as Berber I cannot say, nor could my
infonnants.
The change of ATR class in this word between singular and plural is extremely rare
in the native vocabulary of Koromfe. It also occurs in some Moore loans as a reflex
of the Moore A-harmony (cf. Rennison 1987c; 1992).
This is the only word in Koromfe with an unexpected [d] between the noun stem
and the class suffix.
Since ATR harmony holds for all noun classes and is always completely regular,
the harmonic variants will not be explicitly stated in the rest of the section on the
noun classes.
The long vowel in the singular of saa is shortened in NP+N compounds (of which
there is a very large number). The similarity ofthis word with sa 'father' is probably no accident.
I cannot imagine that the 3rd person singular human pronoun d(l) originates in the
singular of the de/I class because nouns in this class are typically non-human.
See the relevant sub-sections below for the source of these phonetic variants and
examples.
There happen not to be any words in my corpus with tense stem vowels and a nasal
consonant before this suffix -I, but I do not doubt that here, too, the vowel would
be lowered to [e], since the phonological process involved is quite regular.
There are similar puzzling 'allomorphs' in other classes, too, e.g. [a]-[Ja] in the
de/a class. This plus a few singulars like diiTnc 'wood' which have no I in compounds (e.g. da kutre 'tree stump') leads me to speculate that there may have been
a historical I (suffix?) between the word stem and the class suffix in some words.
This fusion of Ib+gl to [k] is also the nonnal case for loans from Moore in this
singular class (but usually with a different plural); the same phonological fusion
process is also the regular case in Moore.
The lack of nasality in the plural of this word could mean that it in fact has an [Ja]
plural variant of the de/a class; note that the word fele]/\ has a nasal suffix despite
the orality of its stem vowel.
Perhaps this is historically a case of double suffixation - cf. also the long -II
plurals in this class and the -Ia plurals of the de/a class in §2. 1. 1.9. 1.3 below.
In other words, the type frequency of the words bearing the suffixes of the de/a
class is the highest, but the token frequency probably is not because of the lack of
productive derivation and of a corresponding pronoun. I therefore consider the gull
class to be more typically the non-human noun class.
In fact only the second half of the [t] is the realization of the suffixal [d]; the first
half comes from the stem final [d], and the sequence d+d fuses to phonetic [t].
Unfortunately the semantics of these words makes the fonnation of a plural impossible. Also, there are no words with a similar stem shape which could be considered to be cognates.
In the verbal morphology, on the other hand, expected geminate l's in this position
(i.e. after the vowel of the second phonetic syllable) always simplify to a single
phonetic [I]. I therefore suspect that the two nouns with a geminate II in this position are (at least historical) compounds. Compare also the geminate m's in the plu-365Morphology464748495051

535455565758rals of the [a]/[ama] sub-type of the :J/ba class in §2.1.1.9.1.1.2 above, which only
occur after a C(V) stem; after a CVC(V) stem, only a single m is allowed.
The words hamne 'fire' and h5mne 'intelligence' have no plural form for semantic
rather than morphological or lexical reasons. Here 'fire' signifies 'combustion'
rather than a 'place where something is burning', and is therefore not countable.
In N+N compounds, such as net:Jm 'sour taste in the mouth', (composed of ne
'mouth' and t:Jm 'ashes') the vowel e is clearly not nasal; but compare also da7ne in
footnote 38 above, which also has a non-nasal stem in N+N compounds.
In Rennison (1993) I show that schwa in Koromfe is the optional phonetic realization of an empty nucleus position in syllable structure; i.e. there is no position in
which schwa must obligatorily be realized.
The only word in my corpus which contradicts this generalization is gedre, PL.
gedau 'kind of hairdo for women'. This must in my opinion be a loan from Moore
or some other local language, since in native Koromfe words the sequence VdrV is
always realized phonetically as VtV - see the next section for details. In a similar
vein, the Moore loan words k5bre 'bone' (cf. native kobre) and sabre 'liver' are
phonologically unusual members of the [fI,] sub-type because in native Koromfe
words the b (or any other single voiced lax stop) would be impossible after a nasal
vowel; either the stop would have to be phonetically nasal (here [mD or the vowel
oral (as in the native Koromfe kubre).
But after a single I the [Ie] variant of the suffix must occur. Cf. §2.1.1.9 .1.3.2.
But immediately following a nasal segment the [ne] , [nde] or [de] variant of the
suffix must occur. Cf. §2. 1.1.9. 1.3.1,3 and 4.
But the suffix combines with a single postvocalic d to form the [te] 'variant' of the
suffix. Cf. §2.1.1.9.1.3.6.
These are the only such words in my corpus, but I have not systematically investigated all types of fruit and vegetable; therefore their number may be considerably
more (as it is in MoonS). The regular pattern of singulatives (with the suffix -Fe)
and their corresponding collectives is described in §2.1.1.8.5 above, and the regular
pattern of diminutives (with the suffix -ga) in §2.1.1.9.1.4.
If the phonetic [fe] part of the word kifeQil is a singulative suffix, then this is one of
the very few words in Koromfe with double suffixation of native suffixes. There
exists the words ki, PL. kiu 'calabash' and kife, PL. kifeu 'small calabash'.
This word must historically be a compound; it seems that corresponding the Moore
word (which also exists as a loan in Koromfe) kiQkirgil contains the same two elements in the reverse order (both words beginning with k in both languages).
There is a single Moore loan bbQa, PL. loloesi 'bridge' with such a singular form,
but with the (loan) plural suffix -Sl. Note the switch in ATR harmony class reflecting Moore A-harmony in the singular form (triggered by the a vowel of the suffix).
The 'tense mid' vowels of the plural forms are in fact lax high vowels (cf. Rennison 1987c; 1993 for details of the Moore vowel system in this regard).
There are no other words in my corpus with a phonological stem shape similar to
fillaQil, but words like m:JsaQa normally have the [gal rather than the [lJa] variant of
the suffix, e.g. h5saga, PL. h5sane 'well' (despite its nasal stem vowel).
The number of words with a front or low vowel which drops when the plural suffix
-fi is present is negligible in comparison.","[397, 398, 399, 400, 401]"

1617Here and throughout this grammar vowels in parentheses were elided phonetically
at normal speech tempo, but 'reappeared' in slower or more careful speech.
No distinction is made in Koromfe between these two types of excretion.
Whether the emphatic particle la should be attached to the subject NP (as here) or
directly to the S node is not at issue here; note, however, that La cannot occur inside
an NP+N complex NP, which indicates that perhaps attachment to S is the correct
analysis.
Here the N stands for either a) a homorganic nasal stop before an obstruent, or b)
zero before a glide G,w,h), or c) [n), [n~)or or even [n3) before a nasal stop.
The gloss 'arrive' is used instead of more literal 'come' throughout this grammar
for consistency with English usage.
Although morphologically a plural form, this word is usually used to denote one
kind/species out of a set.
Unfortunately, my corpus contains no usable example sentences for the other inflectional forms of the question word 'which' when used adjectivally, namely
ndeendl (HUM. SG.), ndeemba (HUM. PL.), ndeehi (NON-HUM. PL.) and ndee1Jga
(DIMIN. SG.)Phonologically, /go/ is merged with the following article /a! and comes out as
phonetic /gJ/. This is a completely regular phonological process of the languagecf. §3.4.3.2.2.
In other contexts, this phrase seems to be lexicalized to a high degree, and often
behaves like an adverb meaning 'maybe'. Cf. also its use as an answer meaning
'maybe' in §1.l.1.2.4.2.1.1 above.
The wider context of this sentence is that the master of ceremonies at an animistic
sacrificial ceremony is apologizing to the ancestors for the fact that his fellow villagers have not made any preparations for the ceremony; he has done everything
himself.
Here the 2nd singular pronoun occurs in its special anaphoric usage for a repeated
3rd person subject - cf. §1.5.2.2 below.
As mentioned in §1.1.2.4.2.1 below, I think that topicalized structures like (123)
are the historical source of the inversion of k5N and a full NP (but not a nondisjunctive pronoun like d,,).
The name PRESENT or PRESENT/FUTURE tense, which I used in previous publications
to designate the PROGRESSIVE aspect, is therefore in fact a misnomer; I beg the
reader's indulgence for the terminological incompatibility with my Koromfe dictionary and texts (Rennison 1987a,b).
This verb has only PROGRESSIVE and DURATIVE forms (tefaa and tefa respectively)
- probably because its use is restricted to such (durative) aspectual contexts.
This clause may be elliptical, with d"" da 'he gain' understood before d"" gille.
Otherwise, as it stands, it looks more like an adverb clause of cause.
This word is a compound of bara 'husband' and kl5 'woman, wife'.
The wider context is: This sentence is spoken by one of three wives of a 'dead'
man in reply to the statement by a 'spirit of the bush' that he can revive the dead145Syntax1819202122
23242526
27282930
31323334husband if no animal has touched him. Another of the three wives had stayed behind to fend off wild animals.
The pronoun object dl of dug<J 'leave' is ambiguous - it could refer to the husband or to the co-wife.
I have found at least one case in my texts where an unreal condition is used where
a real condition would be expected; nevertheless, my informants all had the clear
intuition that 'probability of fulfilment' is the right distinction.
The subject of the original sentence has been shortened here for easier presentation. The full original sentence can be found in §1.5.2.1 below.
Note that the difference in vowel quality between m<J in (161) and me in (162) is a
completely automatic phonological matter: in utterance-initial position m<J is
obligatory, while in utterance-final position me is obligatory.
Such a structure is, of course, only possible when it is the second NP which is
topicalized.
Emphatic structures (i.e. NP rop NP COPULA) seem to be preferred for such past
copular sentences.
In fact, the words tl and a were phonetically merged to tE by a quite general phonological assimilation process.
The gloss 'lose', rather than 'lost' for the word tam in this and several further
examples below is intended to show that this is a plain uninflected verb stem that is
used participially (here with a passive meaning), as described in §1.3.1.5.1 and
§2.1.4.3.1.1 below.
This usage of the phrase selle la is the only possible one. If la were a copula, it
could not be used with an adverb of place (where wi' is required).
As my informant Souleymane points out: This is a correct sentence, but it's hard to
know who's doing what.
The reference of the possessive adjective is ambiguous in this and the next example.
The word m5 'also' frequently occurs pre-verbally, but on closer inspection its
occurrence seems rather to be restricted to the post-nominal or post-NP position, as
shown by d<J SOl] a jemdi m5 bi, 'he took the hippopotamus's child, too', where m5
'also' is suffixed to jemdi 'hippopotamus' inside the compound a jemdi bi 'the
hippopotamus's child'. I therefore analyse pre-verbal m5 as a suffix on the subject
NP.
Here I ignore the case of multiple temporal adverbial clauses introduced alternately
with k5 and hal.
The term 'possessive' is probably one of the most misleading in linguistics; I have
kept it here only for the sake of compatibility with traditional terminology.
This prefix in Moore probably is not (and perhaps never was) an article like that of
Koromfe.
The long form of the DIMINUTIVE (of which only a short SINGULAR but no PLURAL
form exists) is missing in my corpus.
In one of my Koromfe texts the NP a bal]s<J nal]sa 'those spears' occurs (with an
initial article), but when asked directly, my informants always cited forms without
article.
The (first) baa of this structure is stressed, has a high tone, and is phonetically
long. One might be tempted to analyse this word as two words, ba a, where the146Syntax353637383940
4142
4344454647second is the article; however, the fact that numerals prohibit the article a in positive sentences speaks against this analysis. So although it would be appealing to
have the same NEGATIVE PARTICLE ba for both NPs and verbs, I think that on balance baa really is a distinct word with a long vowel.
This NP occurs as an independent sentence in one of my Koromfe texts (a fable),
and describes the soup which rabbit('s wife) made of the hippopotamus's child.
Remember, however, that relative clauses with the unspecified relative k5N (which
canpar excellence modify a noun phrase) often have the same structure as temporal adverb clauses and may be indistinguishable from them.
In contrast with all other examples in the sections, I had to construct this NP artificially because my informants invariably split such a complex NP into a 'set-subset'
structure.
To a Koromfe speaker it is clear that these cooking activities will not be done by
the chief personally, but by one or more of his wives. However, this fact can have
no bearing on the behaviour of the pronouns.
The examples given in this and the following sections refer to the non-disjunctive
variant of the 'reflexive pronoun' only. I have found no sentence with a nondisjunctive pronoun which does not also permit a disjunctive version, and vice
versa.
This sentence contains a 'special anaphoric' use of the 2nd person singular pronoun for the repeated 3rd person singular subject. See § 1.5.2.2 above.
I use the term 'possession' here under protest, because the linguistic category has
nothing to do with ownership, and have kept the term for compatibility with the
Lingua Questionnaire and because everyone knows what we are really talking
about.
I would love to know what whiteness of the stomach (or whiteness of character)
has to do with generosity, but none of my informants could explain this compound.
In compounds, the lexical long vowel of saa is shortened; when used in isolation it
remains long.
This is a typical beginning for a story. All 6 real stories in my collection of texts
have emphasis in the first sentence; either sentence emphasis with ja or NP emphasis with lao
This sentence occurs at a very important point in a story: a wise old man asks the
spirit of the bush to stand up so that he can speak to him (and eventually verbally
defeat him). The two ja here therefore on the one hand emphasize the clauses in
which they are contained, and on the other hand are attention grabbers for the following passage.
In case the impression might have arisen that the position of ja is post-verbal (like
la and d;) described below), consider rna lata dl ja 'I was searching for him', where
the direct object dl intervenes between the verb andja.
Only in one single sentence of my texts did I find an emphatic particle dangling at
the end of a clause, namely in go handa bole ke ba hlm go la 'it was really said that
they met it - la'. However, my informants found this usage strange, and never
produced anything similar themselves.
The situation here is that the hippopotamus and the elephant are having a tug-ofwar, the former in the water and the latter on land. When the hippopotamus succeeds in pulling the elephant into the water, the sentence is emphasized.","[179, 180, 181, 182]"
"For further details and examples, see §2.1.1.4.19 below on partitive

1.2.5.2.7 AdverbialsA noun phrase can be modified by one of the short adverbs m5 'also', b
'in any case', Ie 'only' or S:JI 'only'. The latter two adverbs, both meaning
'only' can be repeated for emphasis, e.g. a n51Ja S:JI S:JI 'only fat (and
nothing else)'. 35 These adverbs can also be used to modify pronouns
(usually disjunctive, but optionally clitic), e.g. gu m5 kIret a b5na j§u 'it
also changes into a female goat', where gu m5 consists of a clitic pronoun
followed by the adverb m5 'also'.
In addition, rarely and probably only in conjunction with action nouns,
a postpositional phrase can modify an NP, as shown in (232).
