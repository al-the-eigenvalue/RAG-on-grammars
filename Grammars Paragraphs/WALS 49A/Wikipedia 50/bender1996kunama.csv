the use of postpositions. What GF (27-9) refers to as “Declension” consists mainly of
examples of the uses of postpositions. GF and also T83 (300) mention vocative with
preposed e! (GF only) or o! The plural takes also a following +(a)me - GF says only

another example of a noun having sg. suffix other than -a@ (but GF38: nouns: 24-30
gives grandmother dfa, grandfather dba). Gender distinctions may of course be
made in other ways. First, there are suppletive lexical items, e.g. darka ‘woman’, ka

or use of the genitive suffix -yna (cf. 1 sg. poss.-ga ‘my’, 3.3.2 below). There is no
alaienable/inalienable distinction. T83 (295-6) has the best treatment of genitive,
based on the formula:
Possessor + Number of Possessor + Genitive (-9g) + Number of Possessed.",[9]

Other nominal relationships (e.¢. locative) are also express
ed by postpositions. GF38

the Iliit dialect) may be from Semitic (e.g. Tigre sob 'person’); this use of ‘person’ as

"Intensive, repetitive, plural, etc. In my notes, attempts to elicit such a derivation
resulted in various devices: use of the same item (e.g. fege+da for both ‘turn over‘
and ‘completely upset’), separate lexical items (e.g. ‘break’ i+‘té, ‘shatter’ issa'kiya
as in unu k-+issa’kiya+ke ‘he shattered’), use of okas ‘again’ for repetition, use of
dr‘ta ‘many’, an‘da ‘big', damad+oka ‘a little’, elitda+bu ‘one-by-one’ as adverbs.
GF38 (143-5) states that use of a cognate vb. n. is used to indicate intensity, e.g. berfda
berf+s+se ‘tore’ (may > berib+berf+s+se with a “quick and elegant effect” in pronunciation).
Incidentally, there are verbs with special dual and plural forms or forms used withplural objects.
‘arrive’,T&B (340) provide a summary with examples: sg./du./pl.: i/imifili(i)o/(i)mo/(ijlo‘come’, u/ulujulu‘enter’. Verbswith -i- orduplicatedconsonants in imperative plural have already been noted in 3.5.2 above. T&B state
that (i)n(a) occurs with plural objects with Type II verbs (except that those with
geminate consonants duplicate instead). This seems to be based on GF38 (134-7) and
may not be complete; T89 (320-2) gives instances of x or! with subject prefixes or
with multiple actions, e.g. herding many cows, which latter is surely a case of plural
object.. T89 also says that some verbs take -[- only with 3rd-person in transitive use.
Dative. The postposition +si is used for dative (and also accusative) as noted in
3.1.4 above.
Motion. There are also some instances of derivational formation of directionals.

"This category overlaps with postpositions. Like posts., adverbs follow heads. The
manner post. bu is used to form adverbs, as in ‘tagamatbu ‘with difficulty,
scarcely’, e+téeta+bu ‘shortly, quickly’. Spatial and time relations (‘before, after,
ete.') are often shown by the use of grammnaticalized nouns (v. 3.1.4). There are a
number of intensivizers used with adjectives: anda ‘big, great’, katta ‘very’, arta,
fau'da ~ foo'da, ‘many, much, very’, madia
‘completely, quite, very, without
doubt’. Exx. from T83 (301): ‘unu anda mdida ‘He is very good’ (lit. ‘he big good""),
and+i katta ""big very’ (katta requires +i on preceding aj.). See also the emphatic
+oka used with pronouns in 3.3.6. T83 (306-8) gives an extensive list of adverbials
of place, time, means, and manner, including independent words such as ‘alle/‘olle‘here/there' or ‘now/then’,‘kiime, ‘kime u'liga,

means“slave” in Amharic) in Ethiopic, Greek, and Arabic sources.(aswhichThus, it seernsthat the Kunama presence in Eritrea is ancient, going back at least 1100 and perhaps
more than 1600 years. Variants of Baada, Baaza are common for the Kunama; the
Neracall them Diila. The language is self-referredto as kn‘ndma au’ra (Kunamaspeech’) or ka2’nama peel‘d (Kunama tongue’). For the name ki‘nama itself, there
are several suggested etymologies (v. T83: 281, 316n.2). Best of these is Reinisch

"The work herein is based on the dominant dialect, Marda. One great drawback
the Castelnuovo dictionary is indiscriminate mixing of dialects.withGrammatical evidence for including Kunama within Nilo-Saharan is found in
Bender 1989, 1991. Among seven “major Nilo-Saharan retentions"" (1991: 6-7),Kunama joins in five: pronoun pattern Ist person/2nd person aji; trace of similar
ajo pattern; nominal and other sg./pl. +a/+e (in fact, all indigenous nouns in
Kunama have sg. in -a, plural in -e, which may be from -a+i, v. 3.1.2 below);
demonstrative near/far ofi or i/o; trace of TMA Perfect/ Imperfect/Future or
Continuous K/N/T (here, capital K means k or phonologically close to k, etc.).
Kunama also joins in 18 of 39 “other retentions” (ibid. 7-8). Briefly, these are: 2 sg.pronounii;3 sg. pronoun with #; pronoun accusative K;pronounor noungenitive in B or M; pronoun or noun genitive in N; locative in R, L; demonstrative
N; demonstrative w; question-marker b, m, w; question-marker r, !; interrogative
formative mVu,wVn; interr. form. S; copula K; copula N; copula T; verbalnichts weiter dazu sagen”. Bohm concludes (118): ""In gewisser Weise ist

Omotic and today completely separated from Omotic languages by over 500 miles
of
Ethio-Semitic and Cushitic, can be in the act of “becomingOmatic"".",[5]
"Jussive, of which impv. is a special case, is the conjugated verb without TMA suffix. It has four distinct forms (not counting the 2nd sg./pl. forms given by GF with
""mitigated"" meanings): Isg., 3sg. 1du.&pl.in., and 3du.é&pl. The examples in my
notes all include the Ila verb i+‘wi ‘allow, let’ (or an unidentified arat+) as apreposed “auxiliary” plus+bu ' by means of’. The importance of this is that it
contains person prefixes. Type I: ‘let me stay, etc.': atwibu gotna, i+wibu gotsu,arabu go+di, é+wibu gotmu. Omitting the auxiliary, other examples: Type Ifa: ‘let

"The formation with. +ko+is very frequent, though it does not always correspond toremember’). It is tempting to think that all these are actually ko+ verbs, but several
are transitive and the verb 'remember' is said to alternate with reflexive ko+’kdya,
which makes it seem that it is a genuine C-initial verb.
Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns are briefly considered in 3.3.6. above. Examples of
use of passive-reflexive verbs from T89 (332) are: itntitke‘he saw it', kotnti+ke""he was seen’, itsi+ke ‘she gave birth’, ko+s'i+ke ‘he was born’, utfurtke ‘he
saved him', ko+furt+ke ""he was saved' (last verb is a “syncopated one"", dropping -1

‘he asked’ or ko+bin+ ‘believe’ as already exemplified above.
GF38 (61) says that Kunama has no impersonal verbs, but always uses instead the
3rd-person sg. or pl. But T89 (330) lists several verbs which are limited to the 3rd
person in subject and take only human objects, e.g. abatsi ‘Ifila (k)a+'Ifillitke

Seems that:all vowels may occur long (ii, ee, aa, 00, iu) both lexically and
grammatically, though definitiveexamples await the results of tene/stress analysis(v..2.3 below). Diphthongs (ai, au, of) are frequent, e.g. ‘Idi'da ‘hide', ‘lauda
‘enfold’,.. dikédd ‘cut’, I use this diphthongal notation throughout because: i)
writing words such as mdid@ ‘good! is preferable to md‘y‘da because it seems that
falling tone requires two vowels (v. 2.3.1 below), ii) no cases of contrastive sequences
with glides (ay, atv, oy) have been found, iii} syllable structure is simplified if postvocalic wand y dre eliminated. Initial oj- alternates with w(aii- in some words:
‘oibia ~: ‘wibia ‘season just before rains', ‘oind ~ ‘waind ‘that, then’, oind ~ waind

"3and some with two equal stresses such as ‘bad’da‘above, up’. GF givessome details about stress on affixes; 1 will mention these where they occur
(especially with jussive, imperative, possessive prefixes).“Lexical examples are not so
clear because of the three-way interraction of stress, tone, and length.
The tonal system is most likely one of two level tones and afalling tone. Highismarked by ” on a short vowel or the first of two symbols in a long vowel or diphthong and low is unmarked. Both in my analysis and in the unpublished notes of
Giorgio Banti (on Barka dialect?), falling tone is a high-low sequence on VV or anend-of-word downdrift on final V, e.g. Banti kaasd*‘belly', my bf‘worm’, (cf. bi’a‘water'), ‘nda‘da ‘carry’. However, I also recorded some falling tones on possibly
short non-final vowels, but in these, the tone may spread over an initial nasal orglide: p@‘insult, term of contempt',‘nna ‘ this', y (ki)‘here,With the foregoing in mind, I present the following contrast sets from my data. in
some cases, sub-phonemic vowel-quality changes are indicated. Low tone is
unmarked except where it is the second part of falling tone. I now think the
following sets were over-differentiated in my original analysis: ‘death=loss', ‘lip=
mouth=door=margin’, 'cook!, pl.=go there!, pl.', ‘build=buy', ‘breaking=dog=planting’, ‘bear child=spend time '. Banti agrees with me only on ‘love’ and ‘wood’.
T&B (337) and especially T83 (291-2) also give examples, some of which agree with
mine. Mininal or near-minimal pairs for suprasegmentals are found in the data below, e.g. for stress: ‘house’ vs. ‘build’ or ‘buy’, for high vs. low tone: ‘weeding’ vs.
‘tooth’, for vowel length: ‘clothes’ vs. ‘goat’. 'LW/M 5910goatclothes

(pl.)syllables V andCV(V)are frequent,whileclosedsyllables (C)VC are also frequent,but do not occur finally except in the agent subject suffix -(de)m (v. 3.1.4). My analysis is that syllables are of form (C)V1(V1)(C), ie. vowel nucleus, long or short, and
optional initial or final consonant. V includes diphthongs au, ai, oi, and if V is a
diphthong, no second V is allowed. Consonant clusters do not occur except in rare
loanwords.","[7, 8]"

"Alexander often notes forms with c~f as representing a “new” vs.
pronunciation, e.g. ‘cénd ~ ’téna ‘eyelid’, cucu’ga ~ tutu’ga ‘large lizard’.an“old”T83 includes mb, nd, nk, g”, K as segments. I think the first three of these can best
be treated as sequences (they are never initial) and the latter two as dialectal or
idiolectal variants. Since 7 is a phoneme, there is a problem of whether gg and 9k
are underlying ng or mk in some cases. One item in my Marda materials is ko‘kita
~ kwe'kita ‘knee’; this is a typical Ethio-Semitic type of variation (though not
prevalent in Tigré). I also recorded an‘gwd ‘hyena’ and an‘kwa ‘boat' and a number
of others which Alexander interpreted as being Barka variants. Thompson has a
number of other idiosynctatic phonetic assignments which I will not go into here.
Other possible consonant clusters are vanishingly rare. Cr occurs in afringa

"Passive’ or''Intransitive, Reciprocal, Reflexive, Impersonal. GF38 (61) says Kunama
has passive,.both agentless and with agent, but almost always uses active voicerather than ‘passive. This may be changing under Semitic influence (especially
Arabic, Tigre, Tigrinya). T&B (338) states that passive-reflexive is a syntactic
constructionof aux. +kos+ ‘be present’ and main verb. According to R90 (65, 84)
+kos+ itself is the passive of sa ‘be’. T89 (331-2) says kos+ is a Type II verb with no 3
sg. prefix:iHe compares the passive construction to verb compounding (seralization): withelisions:‘I holdfor myself, I amheld, I believe!na+ko+bin+ke<*natkos: Nat bin+ke (lit. I+be I+hold +a0). Reciprocal is then the same construction in the. plural, e.g. aynee bilt+ela e+ko+mey ‘one another love' (impv. with

For Type I verbs, T89 (334), some form pas./recp. in the same way as Type II, e.g.

"LW/M 592.3 Suprasegmentals
2.3.1 Length, Tone,Stress, and IntonationSince the analysis of these is incomplete, they are all treated together here. First of
all, regarding length, there is no question that consonant length (gemination across
syllable boundary) is significant both lexically and grammatically (v. 2.1. above).
Thereare clear examplesof contrast of vowellength (iffi, efee, aaa)in the pro-nominal system of independents and possessive object selectors (v. 3.3 below).
Lexical examples are less clear because of interraction of tone and stress. Long vowels do not occur word-finally unless one interprets final “downdrift” falling tones as
occurring on VV,Stress is significant grammatically, e.g. in imperative sg. vs. pl. (v. WWW. below).
EDT (10 note) states that stress (together with higher intonation) is usually on the
penultimate syllable, but that this is not invariable, giving the pair ‘foma ‘fasting’ (<Sem.) vs. to'ma ‘fire’. GF38 (205-7) summarizes stress as follows. Words may have
final, penult, or antepenult stress: exx. retranscribed from GF: ser’ga ‘left-hand’,
‘sula ‘skin sack’, ‘fanaka ‘time’. (My notes show sér'gd and fa'ndka for the first
and last; I do not have items corresponding to the GF penult examples). GF says
further that Kunamas often disagree on placement of stress and that the language
seems to be ""...monosillabica, tanto spiccano e marcando ogni sillaba"". As seen, my
notes agree with GF on ‘left-hand’ but disagree on ‘time’. I also have words recorded
with two degrees of stress (as against lack of stress, which is unmarked), e.g. using ”
as strong stress: vb. n.“gaabe’da

"ERSee? tartsThe reader of section 3 will surely notice that Kunama is a highly agglutinative language. Examples therein are also sufficient to indicate that Kunama is verb-final
and has postpositions (there is also one borrowed preposition- v. end of 3.1.4). This(Ila irreg. x, Wa ibd ‘plow')(Ia: i+‘ya, I: fa).lele+n natso+ke(vbs.

(characteristic of SVO lang- uages) with “recessive orders"". For Kunama the
following orders are found: recessive: N-post., av.-V, prn. obj.-V, V-TMA, prn.
obj.-TMA; dominant: N-aj., N-num., N-poss. (except with kin terms), N-dem (both
preposed and postposed demonstrative elements may occur, but the preposed
element is optional). Thus, Kunama is not ""rigid Type D"" and gives a rather mixed
appearence as is typical of the Ethiopian area, where Type D seems to have
originated in Omotic and spread to Cushitic and Semitic (v. Bender forth. d).
