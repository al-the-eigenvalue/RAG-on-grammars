mmar— 345In Eskimo, in accordance with the ergative system, the first and second person object markers are in general the same as the subject endings of one-place verbsin the indicative and participial, e.g. CAY angute-m ikayura-a-nga‘the man ishelping me’, ikayur-a-m-ken ‘T am helping you’ (-ken is an allomorph of -ten, cf.
Aleut txin). In dependent moods they are on a par with the 3.p. object suffixes mentioned above, e.g. ikayu-qu-m-ken ‘if ] help you’. Also the “half-transitive” construction is possible, with a free personal pronoun in the ablative (or instrumental)
case, e.g. CAY wangug-neng tangva-ku-neng aavurteciqu-t ‘if they watch thetwo of us, they will be amused’ (Woodbury 1984:135).
In Aleut, the object markers for the first and second persons, as well as for
the reflexive third person, are free pronominal forms (2.1.2.2.), which as fully specified in the relevant sense entail a one-place verb, e.g. tayagu-% ting kidu-ku- ‘the
man is helping me’, txin kidu-ku-q(ing) ‘I am helping you’. As objects of oneplace verbs they correspond to the Eskimo pronouns in the ablative (or instrumen-tal) case, but through the Aleut transformation of the ergative system they may have
been dislocated from the suffixal position found in Eskimo (discussion in 1989:36
f.). Anyway, they are on a par with fully specified nouns (except for zero-anaphora,
see 3.9.2.1. and 3.11.2.6.1.) and differ fundamentally from the anaphoric third personsuffixes, as in tayagu-m kidu-ku-u ‘the man is helping him’, kidu-ku-ng ‘I am
helping him’, etc. Aleut has no non-reflexive third person pronouns like the Yupik
and Inupiaq ones (CAY ellii, CSY (e)Iinga, I ilaa ‘he, she, him, her’, etc.), only demonstrative pronouns, which have the syntactical function of nouns or determiners.
An Eskimo verb in the mood called appositional or subordinative (CAY) orcontemporative (Inuit), which like the Aleut conjunctive has mostly the same subject as the associated verb, has only one person suffix, in general either coreferential
with the subject of the associated verb or indicating an object. In accordance with
the ergative system, the first and second person suffixes are subjective or objective
depending on the context. The reflexive third person suffixes, which by themselves
indicate coreference with the subject of the associated (superordinate) verb, are natu-rally subjective, but may also be coreferential with the reflexive object suffix of a
subordinate verb ( Greenlandic examples in Bergsland 1955:59, Fortescue 1984:147).
The non-reflexive suffixes, sg. -ku, etc., are naturally objective, but in Alaskan Yupik
they may also, under certain conditions, be subjective in relation to an object (Miyaoka1996:342; 1997:100ff). The subjective or objective function of these suffixes is in-dependent of the transitivity or intransitivity of the associated verb, e.g. CAY pissuryug-tu-a maligg-lu-ten ‘I (-a < -nga) want to go hunting following you (-ten)’,
nere-rrar-lu-ku an-ciq-ug ‘first eating it he will go out’ (Miyaoka 1997:72);
Greenlandic Kunuu-p ilaga-lu-git aullar-pug ‘Kunuk (rel. subject of the
contemporative) being together with them (-git) went out’ (Bergsland 1955:58; see
also Fortescue 1984:125).
The Aleut conjunctive has a subject marker, an enclitic pronoun, only when
used as afinal predicate (2.1.9.2.) and with verbs of utterance and thought (3.15.3.1.).
As a conjoined predicate (3.9.) with no complement or a fully specified one it has noperson suffix but in accordance with the Aleut system of referenc
e has the suffixes -ka,
etc., in reference to an anaphoric complement. By zero-anaphora
a specified nomi-nal complement of the conjunctive may be shared by the following predicate
(3.9.2.1),
while an anaphoric reference of the conjunctive continues into the following
verb, pos-sibly by an enclitic dative (3.9.2,3.). The Aleut system of reference
(specified vs.anaphoric) thus applies to the whole sentence, possibly including both an outer
and
an inner subject, while the Eskimo ergative system dominates single clauses.
4.4, Verbal valency
Eskimo verbs are either intransitive, admitting only one argument (a sub-ject), or admit both one-place and two-place suffixally marked constructions, whileAleut verbs are intransitive or transitive or both, a transitive verb having either a
specified or an anaphoric object (3.2.).","[181, 182]"

-(i)mdixE,Au-mang,
-(i)mdin3RA=dualFor the 1.p. and for the sg. 2. and 3R pl. possessum there is no case distinction in any dialect.
In Eastern Aleut, the relative sg. possessum with a sg.2. or 3R possessor is
used regularly also for a dual or plural possessum, the number being indicated by
the following term, e.g. 1870 chamin ilkin ‘in your hands’ (Luke 43.46; A 1860chakimis ilkin ). In Eastern the relative dual suffixes are not attested at all, and thepl. -txin in relative function is rare in the material: 1870 adatxin Aguuguu ‘yourfathers’ God’ (Acts 7.32); Unalaska 1910 ilaasatxin hadangin ‘to his relatives’ (J34:86 cylinder recording). [The relative function of -txin, common in Atkan, wasprobably an Aleut innovation. In Eskimo the plural forms in question are largely
merged with the respective singular forms.]}In old Atkan, the sg.2.p. abs. sg. had the archaic postconsonantal variant -in :
1838 sagimagin ‘your face’ (Matthew 6.17); likewise 1860-1952 ugin beside ugiin
‘your own’ (see 2.1.2.2.). In late Atkan, the suffix -Vn (the postvocalic variant) is
only 2.p., while the 3R rel. -Vm is used for both cases. Thus, with the dual lost, late
Atkan has a case distinction only in the 2.p. sg. possessum.
The 1.p.pl. suffix -(i)ngin, the same as the Eastern and Attuan 3A pl. suffix,
is known from Eastern Aleut, regular in Attuan and common in modern Atkan, withthe variant -ngis (the Atkan 3A pl. abs.). In the Eastern Aleut texts, from the 1830's
on, one finds constructions of the type tumaniin ada “for us father”, in the modern
language simplified to tuman adag (cf. 2.1.2.1.4.); see also 2.1.2.1. and 2.1.6. The
pronoun tuman ‘we, us’ contains the ancient suffix -man, which corresponds withthe Atkan -mas, as in adamas ‘our father’, still used by Atkan speakers, with a
variant -mis found also at Bering Island. This suffix is found also in a legend recorded at Nikolski in 1909: Uyumas ii! ‘Our brother!’ (said by a woman, J 38:15
and 42:13), in the Attuan translation Huyungin!",[33]
"In Eskimo, as mentioned in 4.4.3., one-place forms of non-agentive verbsmay have a passive meaning: CAY iir-tuq ‘it is hidden’. The only passive found in
Greenlandic by the pioneers Albert Top 1727 and Hans Egede 1739 (manuscript)
was the reflexive use of the suffix -tit- ‘let, cause’, ¢.g. uamnut ermisipok (=irmiksip-pug) ‘he is washed (had himself washed) by me’.
Eskimo also has stative (resultative) verbs marked by certain suffixes, butthese go also with intransitive verbs, e.g. CAY kit’e- ‘to sink’: kisngaugq ‘it hassubject (3.4.3.); the use of an agent with the passive (3.4.3.6.2., 3.14.2.3.3.3.) maybe due to Russian influence. Very differently from Eskimo, also the subject of intransitive verbs may be removed by the passive (3.4.3.1.), as in Latin, e.g. itur ‘onegoes’. So far, apart from the oblique agent common in Latin, Aleut is an “accusative” language like Latin. But Aleut has also, as relics of the ergative system, anaphoricclauses quite different from Latin clauses, whether active or passive (see for ex-350 — Aleut Grammar — Aleut Compared With Eskimoample 3.2.2.3.). This makes understandable also the use of passives with the agentas the stem: kuusxi-lga-qa-% ‘was taken by a/the cat’, “was catted”,
the passive of
kuusxi-m su-qa-a ‘the cat took it’ (3.4,3.3.3.). This is a predicate clause
with an
outer subject (‘it’), where the inner subject kuusxi-m, in the relative
case, is connected tightly with the verb (cf. also 3.3.2.2.2, and 3.3,3.2.).","[184, 185]"
"Questions with one of the interrogatives listed
above have the same intonation as a declarative sentence. With a final partic
le with rising tone the question
becomes a question about the question, e.g. A Kiin
hagal ii? ‘Who came? (is that
your question?)’.
2.1.9. Verbs
2.1.9.0. IntroductionVerbs differ from nouns by having mood/tensesuffixes. Theso-called General (2.1.9.3.1.), however, is unmarked, and
many stems are ambivalent (see 2.2.1.1,).
Like nominal stems (2.1.1 .2.), @ verbal stem
may end in a short vowel or in
a consonant:
a velar or uvular fricative, a labial
nasal, or -t-, whichalternates
with -ch- or -s- before the initial vowel of
certain mood/tense suffixes (1.3.3.). Before certain mood/tense suffixes a consonant
stem has an auxiliary vowel, which inthe later language has largely become a stem
vowel (1.3.4.1, cf. 2.1.1.2.1.), ora
mood/tense suffix may have a postvocalic and
a postconsonantal variant (separatedby | below; cf. 1.3.4.3-4.),
Most of the verbal forms may come at the
end of a sentence final (main)
clause as well as at the end of a non-final
(subordinate) one; some of them are used
also in phrases with certain auxiliary verbs
(2.1.9.10.3.; 3.8.). Two moods (2.1.9.6,
Imperative and2.1.9.7. Prohibitive) occur only in a final Clause,while two other
ones (2.1.9.8. Anterior and 2.1.9.9. Conditional)
are ptimarily non-final.
In general, verbs with a fully specified or
no complement are marked forthe subject only, while a double marking include
s anaphoric reference to a 3.p.
complement (see 3.2. ff.). In many cases
a simple subject is marked by a number
suffix (2.1.1.1.1) or an enclitic pronoun (2.1.2,1
.2.), while the anaphoric reference ismarked by possessive suffixes (2.1.1.1.2-3.), Inother cases there are special19.18); A 1860qaatamudagan ‘in every direction’. The ablati

Eskimo and Aleut ordinary nouns (with or without a possessive suffix) and
most pronouns have two grammatical (relational) cases, absolutive and relative, in

interrogative adverbs (2.1.7.4., 2.1.8.3.2.). Aleut has only two local cases, called
locative and ablative, but the comparison of the allomorphs shows that the locativealso reflects an allative and the ablative also a prosecutive, corresponding with the
respective Eskimo suffixes (see 1986:114 f.). Certain special forms and relics show

"4.6. Possessive suffixes
In Eskimo, nouns in the three numbers (for the possessed) have
possessive
suffixes for the first, second and reflexive third person singula
r, dual and plural; inthe relative case and in the oblique cases based on it the singulapossessed are not distinguished (possibly an old phonologicalr and plural of themerger). In Aleut, thenumber of the possessed is unmarked in forms with a non-si
ngular possessor
(2.1.1.1.3.). This merger has no further syntactical consequences because these pos-sessive suffixes make the noun fully specified and entail no suffixal reference in thefollowing verb.
For the non-reflexive third person the Eskimo languages
have variants of a3x3 system that can be summarized roughly as follows (with
omission of the transitional velar nasal before a vowel and of the Yupik velar fricati

2.1.5.6. Ordinal numerals
As mentioned in 1.5.1., digits from three on with a 3A suffix are ordinal. Ingeneral, any cardinal numeral can be turned into an ordinal by the transitive noun
hiisi ‘the -th’ (with lengthening of the vowel of the initial syllable of the numerals
‘two’ to ‘four’) or by the transitive verb hiisa- ‘the -th, for the -th time’, e.g. E 1834siichin hiisi, A 1952- siiching hiisit ‘the fourth’; E 1870 qaankun hiisim (or
hiisif ) angalim ilan ‘on the third day’ (Luke 13.32, John 2.1); E 1870, A 1838

ilan ‘in the third commandment’; A 1950 aalax hiisal txin ayagalfis ‘to marry a
second time, remarry’.
For ‘the first’, the numeral used is the counting term tafatax rather than
ataqan, or else itaangi ‘the first’ is used, e.g. E tagatax iisalix, A tafatax hiisal(ix)*(doing) first, for the first time, in the first place’, lit. ‘saying one’; A 1862 maqulimMorphology — Aleut Grammar — 67
2.1.6. Positional nouns
2.1.6.0. IntroductionThe positional nouns, listed in Aleut Dictionary, Appendix 3., indicate a
positional, directional or some more abstract relation to a definite referent and have
possessive suffixes but no inherent number. Most of them can be used in the absolutive
case, possibly also in the relative case, e.g. agaling agiku& ‘he passed my backside,
behind me’; in Eastern simple sg. for 1.pl., e.g. En 1934 alagu ku chachimixsix
‘the sea covering us’.","[41, 42]"
"4.2. Object constructionsled ergative
Eskimo has two well-known object constructions: (i) the so-calconstruction, viz. a verb with suffixal reference both to a definite object,possibly al subject of an innoun in the absolutive case (the same case as that of the nomina

‘the man is

(a)
nominal subject in the relative case, e.g.eating a/the fish’, (b) tayagu-m qa-ku-u (< -a) ‘the man is eating (or just ate) it’
(3.2.1-2.). In the case of (b), the referent of the anaphoric verb may be included inthe sentence as an outer subject, provided that it is separated from the verb by a
focused inner subject, normally a noun in the relative case (3.2.2.3.). Such sentences
are only superficially like an Eskimo structure with an initial object of a two-place
verb. In Eskimo the word order is relatively free and an object coming before the
subject (agent) remains an object, also with a reflexive suffix in reference to the then
following subject (agent), while in Aleut a reflexive suffix makes the object fullyspecified and entails a one-place verb (3.2.5.1.1.), e.g. tayagu-% ada-an kidu-ku-&
‘the man is helping his own father’ vs. CAY angute-m ata-ni ikayur-a-a.
Having a one-place verb, the Aleut construction (a) goes with the Eskimo
construction (ii), with the important difference that the Aleut object is in the absolutive
case rather than in an oblique case, lost in Aleut. Having a specified object, as opposed to the anaphoric construction (b), the Aleut construction (a) covers also the
Eskimo ergative construction (i) with a specified object in the absolutive case. This
leaves the anaphoric construction (b) as the Aleut reflex of the ergative construction,e.g. tayafu-m kidu-ku-u ‘the man is helping him/her’, actually like CAY angufe-m
ikayur-a-a. While in Eskimo the case marking of the functions of the nominal terms
admits a rather free word order, in Aleut the functional interrelation of the two terms
in the absolutive case is marked by the order SOV, e.g. Piitrat Paavilag tugaku&
‘Peter hit Paul’, Paavila& Piitra% tugaku% ‘Paul hit Peter’. But a single nominal
term is case-marked: (a) Paavila-& tuga-ku-& ‘he hit Paul’ vs. (b) Paavila-m tugaku-u ‘Paul hit him’.",[181]

"2. Morphology
2.1. Inflection and word classes2.1.0. Survey
The open word classes are nouns (2.1.1.) and verbs (2.1.9.). Ordinary nouns
have suffixes for number (singular, dual, plural), relational case (absolutive, relative), and grammatical person, so-called possessive suffixes (anaphoric third person, first, second and reflexive third person). Verbs have mood and tense suffixes
(including a zero), several of which share with nouns suffixes for number, relationalcase and grammatical person. Many stems are ambivalent, both nominal and verbal
(see 2.2.1.1.). There are no adjectives other than verbal nouns and participles.",[32]

anaphoric version the demonstrative comes at the end without any suffix (2.1.7.2.),

"Some suffixes always come immediately after the stem and naturally modify the
stem. In the case of verbal stems (including denominal and lexicalized deverbal
derivatives), such suffixes may modify the verb in terms of aspect or Aktionsart, oraffect its valency. Suffixes which may come later in a string can have a wider scope:
the predicate with its arguments, the proposition, or the sentence as a whole, possibly a complex one.
This is seen most clearly in the case of permutable suffixes, e.g. A -za-, E -da-,
and -qali- ‘start, have started’: hla- txin kuri-za-qali-ku-& ‘the boy has started to
smoke (habitually), has become a smoker’ vs. qilam txin kuri-qali-za-% ‘he usually
Starts smoking in the morning’. The final -za- ‘habitually’ goes with the whole sentence, like a tense suffix (the suffix -& is the 3.p.sg. general, a zero tense), while the
non-final -za- ‘habitually’ rather marks the aspect of the proposition or the predicate. The two positional variants also combine, meaning ‘habitually (or repeatedly)
as a custom’ or the like, e.g. E tugidam agnagan tamadaga baabkagan chaf#i-dada-a ‘every month her midwife massages her (the pregnant woman)’ (J 36:4).
2.2.1. Ambivalent stems
Verbal stems used as nouns and nouns used as verbs may be viewed as suffixless
conversion (much as in English), corresponding to suffixes that turn verbs into nouns2.2.1.1. Verbs converted into nouns
Intransitive verbs yield action nouns and agentive nouns difficult to distinguishfrom verbal nouns and participles, e.g. E idgu-, A hiidu- ‘to be drafty (inside of
house)’ and ‘draft (in house)’; awa- ‘to work’ and ‘work; worker (formerly also
servant, bondman)’; alitxu- ‘to wage war’ and ‘war; warrior, war party (also crew)’;
adalu- ‘to lie, tell a lie’ and ‘lie; liar’; hanika- ‘to float’ and ‘float, buoy’;
A igidgu-‘to fall down’ and ‘waterfall’. The following Russian loanwords rather yield nouns
indicating means: kadi- ‘to incense, burn incense’ and ‘censer’; kuri- ‘to smoke
tobacco’ and ‘a smoke, cigarette’.",[62]
"2.1.3.3. E 1832-1870 agachiisa-, 1870- agachiida-,A uhli- ‘only -’
The Eastern forms are derived from agat- above. The Atkan stem is derived
with the suffix -hli- ‘only, etc.’ from the old (original) variant u- of a- ‘to be’. Both
take possessive suffixes; the form A 1860 uhlinginiin ‘for us only’ John 14,22),
rather than *whlimaziin, is probably due to the form ngiin ‘for them / us’ (see2.1.6.1.3.). The 3A forms are used in apposition to a noun or pronoun, in Atkan also
with a referent in the relative case, or else are used anaphorically, e.g. En 1978agachiidang akuqing ‘I am only myself, I am by myself’; A 1971 ubling ayuxtal

anfafim agiicha itxa&tadaku& ‘some people (in Aleut sg.) are different’; A 1950
hiftanangin agiitingis tutakung ‘ some of what he says I understand’. There is
also an adverbial ablative form agiichigaan (for *agiichagaan ) ‘sometimes’.one man) brought up to her boiled red salmon in a round basket, the other one water

-guu) appears to have been replaced by the 3R sg. (-guun) by the 1830's (in Matthew 9.17 1838 -guu-yulux, in 1870 changed to -guun-ulux, the common form alsoin 1838), e.g. A 1860 daan hagyaguu, E 1870 daan aamalisigaguun ‘if your eye is

(stem tduug-), E 1870 tagamikuun (stem tugamig-) ‘when he knocks’ (Luke 12.36).
In Eastern the 3A du. has the relative form (1838-70 -gukin in Matthew 26.2, Mark14.1, A -gukix), while the 3A pl. has no case distinction (-gungin, A absol. -gungis).
The 1.p.sg., without case distinction, has in eastern Eastern (Ea) and inAtkan
a lengthened vowel (-guung), cf. dubitative (2.1.9.5.).

relative case, with a certain temporal distinction (Simultaneity vs. succession, cf.only the simple 3.p.sg. is found, of a- ‘be’ and in passive forms, e.g. qudgiin akalil

In older Eastern there were also anaphoric infixes, sg. -ka-, pl. -ki- (the
quantity of the preceding vowel is uncertain), e.g. 1870 ungutachfiqadakaagiim‘(he) having had him seated’ (Luke 10.34); sugadakiimang ‘(the disciples) having

Oslo, July, 1997Introduction — Aleut Grammar — ]0. Introduction
0.1. Historical survey
The documented history of the Aleuts, in their own language Unangan, in
the dialect of Atka Unangas, begins with the conquest of Attu, the westernmost of
the Aleutian Islands, by Russian fur traders in 1745. Forty years later the Russian
traders dominated the entire chain of islands and a large part of the Alaska Peninsula
(in Aleut Alaxsxa, the origin of the name Alaska), including parts of the territory of
the Pacific Eskimos called by the Aleuts Kanaafin, in Atkan Kanaagis, Koniags.
The Russians called all these people Aleuts, Russian plural Aleuty, a name reportedly transferred in 1745 by pilot Nevodchikov from the name of islands near
Kamchatka (article XVII of the instructions for the Billings expedition 1785 inSarychev 1802 and Sauer 1802, Appendix p. 45), cf. the Koryak village Alut, in

about 1060 nautical miles east of Attu. On the north coast of the peninsula the bor-der was in the region of Port Moller.
At the time of the Russian conquest there were probably more than two
hundred Aleut settlements or villages (tanadgusin, tanadgusis) along the coasts of
the Alaska Peninsula and the larger Aleutian Islands. According to Russian sources
from the period 1768-1840 and some later information (references in Bergsland
1959:11-14), the people were divided into the following eight groups (the names are
given here in the modern orthography):(1) Qagaan Tayagungin ‘People of the East’ (at least thirty-four settlements): the people of (a) the Alaska Peninsula (Alaxsxa); (b) the Shumagin Islands
(Qagiifun); (c) Sanak Island (Sanaagin pl. Samwell 1778) and the islets north of
it (Qutxin); and (d) Unimak Island (Unimax) (according to Veniaminov 1840 II:2 a
separate group, pl. Unimgi[ijn).","[5, 6, 7]"
"4.4.4. Eskimo half-transitive (antipassive) verbs
An Eskimo non-agentive verb gets the same subject of the one-place construction as that of the ergative construction by the suffixal derivation calied halftransitive or antipassive, as in the above-mentioned pair arna-m kuvyagq allg-a-a
‘the woman tore the net’, arnaq kuvya-mek allg-i-ug ‘the woman tore a net’ (4.2.);
Greenlandic anguti-p tuttu tuqup-pa-a ‘the man killed the reindeer’, angut tuttu-miktuqut-si-vugq ‘the man killed a reindeer’.
Aleut, having no oblique cases of nouns, has no half-transitive verbs. The
Aleut analogue of the Eskimo oblique object (kuvya-mek, tuttu-mik) is simply the
specified object in the absolutive case: tayagu-f itRaygi-& asfat-na-& ‘the man killed
aithe reindeer’ vs. tayafu-m asfat-xa-a ‘the man killed it’. An Aleut transitive verbmay be detransitivized by the compound suffix -(3)ka- passive participle + -§i- ‘have’(2.2.5.4., 3.4.4.), e.g. astat-xagi-laga-da ‘don’t kill (anybody), don’t commit murder’ vs. asfat-laga-da ‘don’t kill it/him/her’. But rather than half-transitive, thisderivative is simply intransitive, with no possible object, and is more like a
Greenlandic derivative of the passive participle with the suffix -qar- ‘have’, e.g.
taku-Sa-qar-pit ‘did you see anything ?’, cf. Eastern Aleut amaagan ukugta-qafiku--txin hi? ‘did you see anything ?’ (Mark 8.23),
The Eskimo half-transitive or antipassive verbs are a specialized subtype of
experiencer verbs; those with the mentioned suffix are generally adversative in connotation (Miyaoka 1996:343). Alaskan Yupik has the full range of relationships (see
Miyaoka 1984) but part of it is known also in Inuit, viz. transitive derivatives of
intransitive verbs with the same suffix, as in Greenlandic arn(a-n)i tuqu-Si-va-a ‘helost his (3R) mother by death’, cf. arna-a tuqu-vug ‘his (3A) mother died’. The
closest Aleut analogue is the type ana-a ila-ga-an asa-ku-% ‘his mother died from
him’, with the referent of the anaphoric suffix (-a) of the inner subject (ana-) as the
outer subject of the sentence (3.3.2.3.).parts have a suffix -i- which may reflect the suffix found in Eskimo as half-transi-vs. sit-i- ‘to break, smash to pieces’ (also with an extra transitivizer -t- : old Atkanspecified object, as in ukuusxi-& sigi-na-% ‘he broke a/the window’, the transitive
derivative could possibly reflect a half-transitive use, while the anaphoric version,siti-qa-a ‘he broke it’, could reflect some adversative use, cf. Greenlandic asiru-i-vuq‘he breaks something (e.g. titurfim-mik a cup)’ vs. asirur-pa-a ‘he breaks it’, and
asiru-i-va-a ‘it (object) broke for him (the subject)’ vs. asirur-pug ‘it is broken’.
In a number of cases the transitive -i- is opposed to an intransitive -a- (seeAleut Dictionary p. 468). Most of them seem to have a suffix -sa-, “si-, e.g. ingsa-‘to back, move backward’, ingsi- ‘to withdraw (his hands)’, cf. ingt- ‘to move back,
flinch’ (a relic of the above type); haxsa- ‘to open, become open (e.g. of door)’,
haxsi- ‘to open (e.g. door)’, possibly the cognate of Inuit makitiq- (< *maketeq-)
‘to get up (gradually)’ (*-te- > Aleut -sa- as in several other cases). Another example
is la- ‘to escape (of air in inflated stomach)’, li- ‘to let out (the air of something
inflated)’, the cognate of CAY ler-, neler-, J niliq- ‘to fart’ (also ‘fart’), transitiveCAY elte-, nelte-, I nilit- ‘to deflate, let air out’. In these cases, being opposed to
clearly intransitive verbs, the transitive derivatives in -i- seem to go syntactically
with the Eskimo adversative type asiru-i-va-a.

out, the sentence tangrr-a-a qia-lu-ku ‘he saw her crying’ being unambiguous with
its non-reflexive suffix -ku as opposed to the reflexive -ni in tangrr-a-a qia-lu-ni

"An Eskimo transitive verb with the suffix -ke-, I -gi- ‘to have as one’s N’
corresponds to (is derived from) a noun with a possessive suffix (adjunct), the subject of the verb corresponding to the possessive suffix, e.g. CAY aana-k-a-a ‘he has
her as mother, she (object) is his (subject’s) mother’ (Jacobson 1984:465), fromaanii (aana-a) ‘his mother’ . Aleut has a corresponding suffix -(&)ta- ‘to have as’, as
in ting uchiitila-<ta-ku-s ‘they have me as a teacher, J (rather than another one) amtheir teacher’. But in Aleut also a predicate noun admits an adjunct, specified oranaphoric, e.g. wakus aniqdus uchiitila-a a-ku-q(ing) ‘I am the teacher of thesechildren (rather than of the other ones)’ , uchiitila-ngis a-ku-ning ‘I am their teacher’
(3.1.2.4.). In this particular form, as part of the general reference system, the Aleut
constructions are no doubt innovative, while a possible Eskimo counterpart perhapsgot lost when the copula became a suffix.
In Eskimo, also participles are used with the suffixal copula, differently in
different languages and dialects, for example the CAY past, e.g. ane-llr-u-uq ‘he
went out’; nere-llr-u-a-qa ‘I ate it’ Jacobson 1984:491). The Inuit passive mentioned in 4.4.6. is a passive participle with the suffixal copula, and at least in
Greenlandic the intransitive participle (in Inupiaq also an indicative), with or without certain class-free suffixes, makes with the suffixal copula both intransitive and
transitive verbs, e.g. tikit-su-u-vug ‘is the one (only one) who has come home’;
atur-uma-nngit-su-rsu-u-va-a (old orthography atorumangitsorssiiva) ‘he will
absolutely not use it’ (Schultz-Lorentzen) (cf. Bergsland 1955:101). Such forma-tions may reflect less rigid phrases comparable with the Aleut ones (3.8.1.1., 3.8.1.4,).
From the suffixal copula is derived CAY -(ng)urte-, J -nngur- ‘to become’,used with nouns and participles, for example in the Greenlandic sentence quoted in
4.7.: asa-ssu-atsid-ngor-pat ‘they became quite loving towards him’ (asa- ‘to love’).

"2.1.4. Quantifiers
2.1.4.1. E husu-, usu-, A huzu- ‘everyone, everything; all; whole; both’
This stem takes simple number suffixes and possessive suffixes. The 3A
suffixes have a referent in the relative case or are used anaphorically. Derivatives
with -hli- ‘just, etc.,’ and E -iigusa-, A -iiguza- ‘quite, really’ are frequent. E.g.huzuugizangis ‘(absolutely) ali of their boats’ (N.M. 3:39); A 1950 hlak huzukix
‘both of my sons’; A 1952 chagim huzuu ‘ all of the halibut, the whole halibut’; Ea
1981 usung nanakuf ‘all of me is aching’; E 1870 husumchi hadagaanuluxtunuxtakuqing ‘I am not talking about all of you’ (John 13.18).
In reference to the subject or to the referent of the possessor of a following
nominal term, a 1. or 2.p.pl. suffix agrees in Atkan with the subject marker or the
possessor, e.g. 1860 huzuchi kayix safahli<takuxtxichi ‘all of you are still asleep’
(Mark 14.41.); 1950 huzuhlimchix ukuxtaqachix ii? ‘did all of you see them?’;
huzumas tanadgusimas ‘the village of all of us’.
Eastern Aleut has in these functions ablative forms (infix -ki- ), e.g. Eu1909 usukiingin ukudigalix angfagikun ‘we are all living in good health’ (J 38:4);
1870 husukiimchi Ting tutaattxichi ‘listen to Me everyone of you’ (Mark 4.14);
husukiimchi ilagaan taangaaqachi ‘drink of it, all of you’ (Matthew 26.27); En
1935 (Ea 1983) usuki()ngin sangux (sangut) nanakut ‘the stomachs of all of us
are aching’ (for the simple sg. sanfuf cf. 2.1.2.1.4. end). The ablative is used also
with the pronoun tuman as an object: E 1870 husukiingin tuman sunan ‘they
received all of us’ (Acts 28.2).",[39]

"Also the Aleut participles are used both as independent predicates (2.1.9.3.)
and in participial constructions (3.14.). With the transformation of the ergative con-struction into the Aleut system of reference, the subject of transitive verbs has be-come like the subject of intransitive verbs with their possible oblique complements

subject marker (3.14.0.). But there are three versions: (a) nominal subject (inner or
outer) in the absolutive case, (b) nominal subject in the relative case (ora 1., 2. or 3R
possessive suffix), (c) the subject (inner or outer) inherent in the participle, a verbal noun.",[187]
"In Aleut, the non-agentive verbs naturally got lost as a category together withthe ergative construction, which got lost with the loss of the oblique cases of nouns.",[183]
"These suffixes refer to a preceding term, specified in the relative case or
known from the context or the situation, e.g. tayagu-m ula-a ‘the man’s house’,
ula-a ‘his house’. They may indicate the number of the possessum or (and/or) that
of the possessor (the referent), depending partly upon whether or not the latter is
specified in the construction; see 3.1.1.6.
In Eastern Aleut the relative sg. suffix is - and was - used commonly also for
the dual and plural, the number being indicated in the following term. The dual
suffix -kin, well known from Atkan, is barely attested in Eastern, e.g. Umnak 1910
amakux lakin adakin ‘toward those two sons of his’ (J 51:21 original cylinder
record, confirmed at Nikolski 1982 and 1987; in Jochelson’s edition 1923 altered to
Jakix). In his translations of about 1870 Shayashnikov a few times used the absolutive
suffix -kix instead of the relative one, e.g. ulugakix Kugaan ‘on His cheeks’ (John
19.3; A 1860 ulugakin kukin), a usage found also by Marsh at Nikolski about
1950. In a few cases Shayashnikov (and Marsh’s consultant) used likewise the plural suffix, which in Eastern Aleut has no case distinction, e.g. inim inkamaagungin
kungin ‘on the sky’s clouds’ (Mark 14.62; A 1860 kuyuudam inkamiigungin
kungin). In the singular, the case distinction is generally observed but already in
(for
1935 the absolutive could be used instead of the relative: ulam chimaluuchimalugan) angadaan ‘from the top of the floor of the house’.
In the speech of young Atkans, the set has tended to be reduced to a singular
and a plural without case distinction: sg. -V (vowel length, the postvocalic variant of
the abs.sg.), pl. -kix. With the young speakers (as also at Nikolski), the dual has
become obsolete as a category, while the 3A pl. is used as a 1.p.pl. (see 2.1.1.1.3.
below).",[33]
"3.6.2.3. Relational and ordinal determinersRelational nouns, derived by the suffix
-uugi- from positional nouns
(2.1.6.3.2.) or demonstratives (2.1.7.8.), have
as determiners invariably the abs.sg.
form in-&, e.g. A 1950- Qagaagit Kii2uusig
‘Eastern Mountain’ (Amlia 160), Suung
qigaagig chaxaa ‘the eastern hollow of S’ (bight
, Atka 569); ingaa#if nidilim kugan
“(in) next week’; Eu 1909 aman kinguugit
tayagug ‘that youngest man’, amaan
kinguugig taya8(u)maan ‘to that youngest
man’ (J 34:15, 18); Ea 1983 qaluugig
kigusin ‘inner teeth, molars’. With the relati
onal noun as the head of an adjunct
phrase the relation is the inverse, cf. E 1909
waafit ula& ‘the nearest house (the
house on this side)’ and ulam waagii ‘this
side of the house’.
Ordinal numerals constituted by the transitive
noun hifsi-& (2.1.5.6.) with a
head inthe relative case may have the abs.sg. form or
agree in case with the head,
e.g. A 1951 siching hiisit angalim ilan ‘on the
fourth day’; E 1870 qaankun hiisig
/ hiisim angalimilan ‘on the third day’ John 2.1 / Luke 13.32)
. The alternative is
the cardinal numeral as the head of an adjunc
t phrase (3.6.1.2.), e.g. A 1860 angalim
qankungin ilan or angalim gqankugan
ilan (ibid.).
The ablative form itxaan is used as a deter
miner as well as an oblique term,
.g.A 1950 itxaan tanadgusim kugaan
waafakug ‘he came from another villag
e’;
En 1910 itxaan tanankungiin ‘from other villages’ (J 59:19).",[106]
"The ambivalent word qila- ‘morning; to spend the morning, to do during
locative forms): qilam ‘in the morning, this morning’, 3A sg. gilagan ‘tomorrow,
the next day’, Atkan also, with a predicate in the past, ‘yesterday’; it has also the
obscure adverbial form qilaag ‘early, early in the day’. Eastern yam ‘yesterday’ is
today’.
The likewise ambivalent word amax, amg- (only noun) ‘night’ has an ablative with the meaning ‘by night, at night, in the night’: E amgaan, A amgaax (andamgaagan), the former like the 3A sg. abl. of a positional noun (see 2.1.6.), the
latter like the ablative of a demonstrative (see 2.1.7.). So also qanax, qan’g- ‘win-ter’, E qan’gaan, A qan’gaax ‘in the winter, during the winter’; E saaqudax,
saaqudg- ‘summer’, saaqudgaan ‘in summer’. Compounds with king- ‘time after’, comparable with the positional noun agal- ‘rear; space behind; subsequent time’,
have also a locative (like the relative): angalikinga ‘evening’ (from *angalim kinga),
E loc. angalkingan, abl. angalkingaan (syncopated), A angalikingaan ‘in the
evening’; saaqudikinga ‘fall, autumn’ (from *saaqudgim kinga), E, A loc.saaqudikingan ‘in fall’; qanikinga ‘spring’ (from *qan’gim kinga), E abl.
ganikingaan ‘in spring’; Eugikinga ‘dawn, daybreak’, abl. ungikingaan ‘at night,
after or about midnight’.

"Formally, a participial clause is treated as a whole. The participial predicate,
rather than a nominal term, is marked for case, absolutive or relative, in the matrix
sentence, and the clause may have a demonstrative determiner (3.6.2.4.). A nominalterm of the participial clause may be the semantic head of the clause, serving, for
example, as the subject or object of the matrix sentence, but it is not a formal head of
the construction like the head of a relative clause in English. The semantic relationmay be ambiguous (for example, both the subject and the object of certain participial clauses may serve as the subject or object in the matrix sentence), and a participial clause may also be treated as a semantic whole, as an expression of fact (3.14.4.;for the use in report clauses see 3.15.).
Formally, there are three versions of participial clauses.As an example of the
simplest case, the Atkan sentence hla-& aygag-iku-X ‘a/the boy is walking’, pl. hla-s
aygag-iku-s, has the following participial versions:

In a normal context, names of parts of the body have a possessive suffix,

‘her belly being held on both sides with two hands (namely the hands of the midwife)’ (J 36.7).
Kinship terms have likewise normally a possessive suffix. Without it, some
of them have a different sense: A asxinu& ‘girl’, asxinung ‘my daughter’; hia‘boy’, hlang ‘my son’; ada ‘priest’, adang ‘my father’.
The use of the simple singular is conditioned by the following possessed term
in cases like A 1950 ana aniqdut hadangin huyakuf& (translated from:) ‘the mother
went to her children’, cf. 2.1.1.3.3. end.
As a term of address, a kinship term has a 1.p. suffix, but also the simpie
singular is attested, e.g. E 1840 Huyung a! ‘My (fem.) brother!’; E 1909 anaking,
Au anak(i) ‘my parents! (J 82:8); Eu 1910 Asaga ‘Cousin!’ (J 68:3 ff.). The mod-em vocative forms A maamaa ‘mom!’ and taataa ‘dad!’, beside maamang, taatang,
could be due to English.
Without a context, as a lexical information, all these words may be used
with a simple number suffix; examples in 2.1.1.3.1The so-called possessive suffixes are referential in a general sense. For example, ulang ‘my house’ may indicate a house that the speaker owns as well as a2.1.1.4.2. Temporal and local nounshouse the speaker lives in as a guest. For more details see 3.6.1.1.

"126 — Aleut Grammar — SyntaxSyntax — Aleut Grammar — 1273, Syntax3,0. Introduction
Most Aleut sentences and clauses have a verbal predicate, which normally
comes at the end (qualification in 3.1.1.1.). Nominal sentences are constituted by
demonstratives (3.1.3.). In Eastern Aleut there are also nominal sentences of theRussian type, no doubt due to the Russian impact, while the corresponding sen-tences in Atkan and Attuan have a verbal copula (3.1.2.). The verbal predicate of asimple sentence or of the final clause of a complex one carries the temporal and
modal marking in relation to the act of speech, while the verb of a non-final clause is
marked in relation to the following clause. A complex sentence may contain an
unlimited number of clauses, in actual texts recorded on a cylinder phonograph
(Jochelson 1909) or on magnetic tape up to some fifty. Quite often the speaker appears to have the choice between making a “full stop” (the final absolute tense and
mood marker) or adding more clauses to his sentence. An Aleut complex sentence
thus appears to be a chaining structure constituted by a “running superordination”.
A simple sentence or clause may include a subject or no subject (3.1.1.3.meteorological expressions, 3.4.3. clauses in the passive). The predicate may be a
verb with no complement, a predicate noun with a copula (3.1.2.), or a verb with a
preceeding direct object in the absolutive case (3.2.) and/or an oblique term or localcomplement (3.3. a positional noun in a local case with a nominal adjunct and/or a
possessive suffix, or a demonstrative or interrogative form). The number of terms(arguments) may be increased or decreased by verbal derivative suffixes (2.2.5.,
3.4.). In addition there may be a temporal adverbial (3.7.).
The terms (arguments) of a clause may be specified (explicit) or anaphoric.
The verb of a simple sentence or a final clause with fully specified or nocomplements may have a nominal subject in the absolutive case or a 1. or 2.p. subject marker, enclitic or suffixal (3.1.1.1-2.). If the nominal subject is left out as knownfrom the context or the situation the verb implies an anaphoric reference to it, e.g.(hyphens added for clarity)

"4.4.1. Intransitive verbsEskimo and Aleut verbs that admit only one suffixally marked argument,
possibly a nominal subject in the absolutive case, are, for example, CAY tai- andAleuthaga- ‘to come (to the area of the speaker)’; tuqu-, asta- ‘to die’ (also ‘death’);
qavar-, saga- ‘to sleep’ (also nominal); qia-, qida- ‘to cry’; palu-, haaga- ‘to starve’;qater-, quhma- ‘to be white’; ange-, anguna- ‘to be big, large’.
4.4.2. Agentive verbsEskimo agentive verbs may have the same subject in both constructions,
possibly a noun in the relative case in the ergative construction, the same noun in the
absolutive case in the “half-transitive” construction, while the corresponding Aleut
verbs are both transitive and intransitive, e.g. CAY nere-, Aleut qa- ‘to eat’; nuteg-,kalu- ‘to shoot’. Here belong also, as a subtype, verbs with a possible local object,e.g. CAY mayur-tug ‘he is going up’, mayur-a-a ‘he is climbing it’, Aleut hanga-(see 3.2.6.3.).",[182]
