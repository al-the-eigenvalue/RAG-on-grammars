"They are never markedfor aspect, but function as though inflected for
the particular and may or may not have an alienably
possessed counterpart functioning as a generic.
Inalienably possessed nouns are inflected for three
cases:an object case like the alienably possessednoun, a possessive case, and an instrumental case.
Both possessive and instrumental functions are
marked by a single case, the genitive, for
alienably possessed nouns.",[213]
"The genitive caseinflectional suffix {un} when affixed to this
class of nouns, only marks the syntactic function
of possession; the instrumental case suffix {r},
which only occurs with inalienably possessed nouns
and pronouns, marks instrumentality.",[214]
"Nouns are inflectedfor three morphological cases, two aspects,
occasionally for diminutive, or plural, and
can be followed by postclitics, whereas pronouns
are marked for three iersons, three numbers,
three cases, and may be optionally followed by
a small class of suffixes.

"For example:/kete»t carawa/ 'one coyote'237Attributives(of verbs in the locative case, i.e.,
words in the locative case and noun phrases with heads
in the locative case, precede the verb they modify.
For example:
/wint^U'n qewelin buha/'in an Indian househe did live'
/9ewin biya/'here be ...'/qolci-n norel phuta»/'It's boiling up inthe sky heading south'
/^e^lin kuda/'step all over'Attributives of verbs in the genitive case follow the
verb they modify.","[242, 243]"
"Nouns unmarked for case,that is, marked only for aspect, function syn­
tactically as subjects.",[207]
"They are:{um} object case suffix
{un} genitive case suffix
{in} locative case suffix
{r} instrumental case suffix
{t} possessive case suffixBoth verbs and substantives are further
subdivided on the basis of formal criteria.","[89, 90]"
"The substan­tival morphological cases play a relational role in
marking subjects, objects, instrumentality, location,
and possession, expressing these functions differently
in active and passive constructions.",[43]
"Nouns inflected for genericaspect also function as subjects of active and
medio-passive verbs, and as noun attributives.
The inflectional suffix {urn}, the object
case, marks nouns and phrases as objects of
transitive and medio-passive verbs.",[207]
"Three dependent nonpossessed nouns are clitics
and have disjunctive and adjectival functions,
while fourteen are compounded to substantive
stems, stustantive themes, or substantives in­
flected for case, and have adjectival function.
The eleven independent non-possessed nouns
occur as full words and function as demonstratives,
interrogatives, and classifiers of quantity.
Although inflected maximally for both case and as­
pect, the aspect and case allomorphy is so anomalous
that no attempt has been made to establish sub­
classes of non-possessed nouns, paradigms being
given instead for each form.",[215]
"208Non-possessed. nouns never occur with possessive
pronouns or with prefixes, are maximally inflected
for two aspects and three cases, but are, in general,
not inflected for all cases in both aspects,
and are never syntactically modified by the
diminutive, pejorative, or by clitics.
The clnss of alienably possessed nouns
is open in membership and constitutes the major
type of noun in Wintu, both in terms of the number
of forms, and the number of declension classes.
It has already been discussed in Section 3.1.
The class of inalienably possessed nouns
is closed in membership, including only ten
members, all of which are kinship terms.","[213, 214]"
"Thus, attributives of nounswhich are in the locative or genitive case or are
subject pronouns precede the noun heads they modify.
For example:
/wint^u'n qewelin/ 'in an Indian (Wintu) house'
/pi kete«t/
/po*min !\.uci/'that lone one'
'...fell, stuck in the ground'/yay-seden yaythapcus/ 'Coyote's backsplitter'
Generic subject attributives of nouns follow the heads
they modify.",[242]
"Inference plays a large role in thelatter case although specification is possible for
emphasis and clarification.",[43]
