"1.8. Case marking. Languages with verbs that predominately follow
both the subject and the object almost always have a case system (Greenberg
1966:113). An ergative-absolutive case system identifies the major clauseconstituents of Epena Pedee.®
The subject of a transitive clause is always marked by an ergative or
cause suffix (see §5.1). The ergative suffix -a is used with singular pronouns
and the marked plural pronoun (i.e., taci-a, 4ci-a, paci-a; see §4.13).",[25]

Case
The case markers of Epena Pedee are postpositional clitics that have a
specific meaning when they mark the ergative, absolutive, and dative
constituents of the clause; they also have a more general meaning, however, whenthey are attached to other clausal constituents. These markersoccur on the last word of a noun phrase and also on the verb (last word)
of relative clauses (see §9.9-9.12).
Similar ergative-absolutive systems are found in other languages of the
Chocé language family, e.g. Catio (Rex 1975:38-40) and Embera (Ras-mussen and Mestia 1985:115-117).”°
This chapter discusses the markers of the ergative, absolutive, and dativeconstituents of the clause as they fit respectively into the broader uses of
theirmarkersascause,absolutive,andinherentgoal,aswellasthemarkers of other constituents of a clause including external goal, possession and composition,accompaniment,location, direction and origin and,finally, comparison.

Studies in the Languages of Colombia 4
Publicatious in Liuguistics Number 118
Epena Pedee is a language of Colombia, spoken by approximately 3500 people, and classified as a member of the Southern
Emberé dialect cluster of the Choc6é language family. Epena
Pedee Syntax details the major grammatical structures of the
language, from morphology through discourse, with an introductory sketch of its basic phonological characteristics (including
suprasegmental nasalization). Epena Pedee is an ergative-absolutive language, but one in which the notion of subject plays an
important role, as demonstrated by the fact that it is the subject
which manifests number agreement with the verb. The basic word
order of the language is SOV (or: subject-object-verb), with the
typical ordering patterns typologically expected of such languages
largely manifested. (Within the noun phrase some modifiers
precede the noun and others follow.) With extensive examples,and discussion presented in an atheoretical framework, Epena
Pedee Syntax is a readily accessible source of information on this
little known language.

He said, “At this place I will give you a donkey.”
The clitic -pa is also used to mark instrument as in (264) and it also

5.2. Absolutive. The absolutive case is not marked. It is usually the first
noun phrase to the left of the verb in a simple SOV clause. The absolutive
¢ik’é-ra ‘many fish’ in (266) has no overt case marker as is the case with

and the sense of ‘upon’ in adverbial clauses. It thus has a generalized
meaning of inherent goal.
Inherent goal deals with the point of predication (Longacre 1983;163),
whereas external goal (marked with -it’ée; next section) deals with goals
other than those of the point of predication.
The dative case is indicated by -md-a, -4, or simply vowel lengthening
and stress on the final syllable of the noun phrase. In (268), nawe ‘mother’,
the recipient or goal, is marked by -md-a.

bears any case markers that normally would mark the noun phrase. In (47),
the ergative case marker -pa, which would normally follow the last word
of the nounphrase,follows the verbof the relative clause; the relativeclause is enclosed in brackets and the head noun is in bold.",[30]

Clause
In this chapter the elements of the clause are discussed. Section 7.1
provides a discussion of the normal order of the constituents within a
declarative clause; §§7.2-7.7 consider the formation of interrogative
clauses; §§7.8-7.11 give a description of imperative clauses; and §§7.127.17 give a description of negation. ©
7.1. Order of clause constituents. Typically a clause contains preverbal constituents (subject and/or direct object), the verb phrase, and
post-verbal constituents (oblique phrases including the dative). In the
examples of this section, constituents are separated with a slash (/).
Constituent order has a significant role in identifying the function of
clause constituents. Clause (499) is particularly illustrative of this point
because it is an equative copular and the nouns are not marked for case.
The first element is the subject and the second is the predicate.(499) carlos / josé ak*ére | pa-hi

In the remainder of this paper the absolutive case is not indicated.
1.9, Constituent order. Although Epena Pedee is ergative, subject is a
relevant category, as demonstrated by the fact that the verb is marked
plural when the subject of either a transitive or an intransitive clause is
plural. In (26) and (27), subject noun phrases are marked by -rd (plural)
and number is marked on verbs by -da (plural subject).",[26]
"The object of a transitive clause and the subject of an intransitive clause
are generally not marked by an overt case suffix. In (24) and (25), the
absence of an overt case marker is indicated by -@, glossed as absolutive(ABS).”

4.13. Personal pronouns. There are two sets of personal pronouns in
Epena Pedee, an unmarked and a marked set (those which have the suffix58Epena Pedee Syntax-¢i attached). Both may also be used as possessive adjectives (§4.3). In
(229), the ergative morphemes, -pa and -a, are shown in parentheses with
their corresponding pronoun. The unmarked plural pronouns use -pa; the
rest use -a. All other case markers are consistent irregardless of the
pronoun.

Marked pronouns, in general, indicate that the speaker is giving special
emphasis to the referents of those pronouns. The suffix éi which marks the
pronouns is similar in use to the referential adjective (§4.6), in that it
relates back to a participant previously mentioned.","[73, 74]"

NounPhraseThe noun phrase is composed of a noun head, which may be singular or
plural and simple or complex. The noun may be preceded by a prenominal
modifier (possessive adjective, demonstrative adjective, indexing adjective,
referential adjective, or another noun). The head can be followed by a
postnominal modifier (descriptive adjective, numeral, or quantifier). It is
not usually preceded or followed by more than one element. For more
complex constructions, relative clauses are used (see §§9.9-9.12). Clitics

identification of the ergative case with the subject of a transitive clause and

1.11. Head nouns and their modifiers. Some modifiers in Epena Pedee,
such as demonstrative adjectives, possessives, and noun phrases, precede noun
heads, whereas other modifiers, such as numerals, quantifiers, and descriptiveadjectives and relative clauses, follow them. This is in agreement with
Greenberg’s universal number 19 (1966:87): if the descriptive adjective followsthe noun head, there may be a minority of adjectives which precede it.!°
I first consider nominal modifiers in which the modifier follows the head.
These include numerals, quantifiers, and adjectives, as shown in (40)—(42);
the modifiers are bracketed.",[29]

2.10-2.18ClosedclassesThe remaining parts of speech to be discussed
classes which have a limited number of members.are closed classes, i.e.,2.10. Pronouns and other pro-forms. Pronouns and other pro-forms
substitute for nouns, noun phrases, clauses, or larger units. The referent of
a pro-form is usually identifiable from its context. Epena Pedee has personal, indefinite, and demonstrative pronouns (see §§4.13—4.18), interroga-tive pro-forms (see §7.3), and pro-sentences.
Pro-sentences are single words which take the place of complete sentences. Answers to polar questions are often pro-sentences. The construction in (97) presents a question, followed by a positive answer, which is a
pro-sentence. The contextual meaning of the pro-form follows in parenthesis.","[43, 44]"
"A dissimilar comparison involves comparing an entity (one pole) with a
standard of comparison (the second pole). The standard of comparison
may be stated overtly or implied from the context. The dissimilar case
marker -ra is attached to the comparative adjective.
In the simple comparative clause of (340), the comparative word
k'4y4ara ‘than’ (§1.16) relates the point of dissimilarity between the entity
ardit'a ‘red squirrel’ and the standard sidima ‘brown squirrel’ with which
it is being compared. -ra is attached to the adjective of the comparison.(340) ardit'a[sidimak'ayéara tawarda-ra] ba-pa-rired“squirrel brown“squirrel than
large-CMPR be-HAB-PRES
The red squirrel is larger than the brown squirrel.
In (341), the standard of comparison avién k'aipée ‘small plane’ is stated
earlier in the sentence. In (342), the standard of comparison hdhérro ‘fish
(species)’ is stated in the previous sentence.",[96]
"48Epena Pedee SyntaxMost commonly ¢i is used to express what appears to be a possessive
relationship between a referent and a related item or person. However,
the possessive quality of the construction is derived from the type of noun
modified by ¢éi. For example, a hand must be a part of someone or
something, while father contains the component of being a father of
someone. In (175), from a text describing a bird, ¢/ precedes the body
parts.(175) ¢iek*4rra p'aimda ba-pa-riciREF back
black
be-HAB-PRES REF
Its back is black and its chest is red.tiap'oréechestredThe referent of ci at times may be several clauses away or it may change
within a clause. The hearer must be able to associate the most logical
referent or participant with the noun phrase containing ci. Example (176)
is from a story about a young Epena man. He is the referent of the first
ci but his father is the referent of the second one.(176) iak’dré-pama-ga-hiiwérd-aREF father-ERG that-like-PST REF woman-DAT
His father said to his (the father’s) wife,...
In other noun phrase constructions, nominalized adjectives function as
noun heads and ¢i again relates to an understood noun. In (177), the noun
p'4ima ‘black one’ is derived from the adjective p’aimda ‘black’ and éi
relates to previously mentioned beads.(177) éip*4ima piPia-rabi mi-Pit'éeREF black
pretty-CMPR be me-for
To me the black ones (beads) are prettier.
Another use of ci is in a headless relative clause in which ¢i is comparable to a relative pronoun, as illustrated in (178). é/ also serves as the
head for interrogative proforms whose referents are known. In (179), ci sd,
the contracted form of ¢i sagita ‘which one (specific)’, is illustrated. In(180), éi k’4are ‘what (one out of a known set)’ shows the use of éi with
a different interrogative proform.(178) &ip*arat’a irubi-paitianeto-riéREF silver
have be-ERG liquor negotiate-PRES
The one who has money buys liquor.","[63, 64]"
"I now turn to nominal modifiers in which the modifier precedes the
head. Demonstratives and possessive adjectives or noun phrases (bracketed in the following examples) precede the nouns that they modify.",[30]
"4.17. Spatial deictic pronouns. There are two spatial deictic pronounsin Epena Pedee, aé4 ‘this one (here)’ and acd ‘that one (there)’. These
function like demonstratives but usually only occur when accompanied by
gestures. The pronoun ac4 tends to occur with the stative verb bi ‘be’. In
(256), an agouti has been caught by a mother tiger. In order to get her to
release him, he tells her that what she has hold of is a stick and that this(gesture) is his real foot. aé4 bi may occur as a shortened form, éa, as
illustrated in (257).(256) hé-gi— pak'urii-da a-hithat-SPEC tree-DECLadabi-tami biiri-dasay-PST this“here be-FOC my foot-DECLa-hisay-PST
“That is a stick,” he said. “This, which is here, is my foot,” he said.",[79]
"The list in (361) is of verbs that demonstrate object incorporation using
the generic morpheme ne-.(361) ne-?¥= ‘crave’ne-hede-k'o‘eat together’ne-Cia‘steal’ne-ua‘carry something’ne-uu — ‘plant’ne-Cuu‘cook’ne-hirine-sii‘strain’‘hunt’6.4-6.10 Derivational suffixes on verbsThe suffixes between the verb stem and the aspect or tense suffixes are
derivational. The use of these suffixes gives the speaker the ability to
streamline the discourse and to maintain proper focus on the participants
(see §6.4). The following discussion is not exhaustive, but covers the most
common morphemes in this category.
Many derivational suffixes may also function as independent verb stems.
There is probably little difference between these and what I call an
element of a serial verb (§6.2). What I have described as two separate
processes is probably no more than different degrees of grammaticization
of a single pattern. Undoubtedly, it was through serialization that these
suffixes have taken on distinct grammatical uses, as shown for instance in(362). Whether -k'a is a serial form of the verb kaa ‘bite’ or a suffix
meaning ‘with one’s teeth’ is difficult to establish.(362) usd-pahik*ara thia-kha-thaa-hidog-ERG vine
_cut-bite-OBJ-PST
The dog bit the vine in two.",[103]
"§.12-13 ComparativemarkersComparative case markers reflect similarity or dissimilarity between
standard and the element with which it is being compared.a5.12. Similarity. The similarity marker -k’a ‘like’ indicates that in some
manner the compared element is similar to the standard (which bears
-k'a). In (335), ‘the way José sleeps’ is compared with the standard, ‘the
way an iguana sleeps’; op’6o ‘iguana’ has -k""a attached. The phrase barrobai ‘top down’ expresses the point of similarity.(335) josé op’éo-k'akaibi barro-baiJosé iguana-like sleep be top*down-down
José is sleeping like an iguana sleeps, on his belly.
-k'a may also be attached to dependent verb forms such as -bj ‘be’. In
(336), the writer explains about a visit to a museum and compares ‘the way
a mummy was sitting’ with the standard, ‘the way a live person sits’.(336) unu-pd-riepérawérapiu-daCokhai bi-k'aakibifind-HAB-PRES person woman die-PST alive
be-like upright be

Whena comparison of equal entities is made, the word 4uk'a is used.4uk'a may be a combination of ai ‘same (specific), (§4.5) and -k/a ‘like’,
since a variant form 4ik'a is used by some speakers.",[95]
"Adjectivesusually endstressed, e.g., phaimaawitha series of vowelsthe first of whichis‘black’. However, they can also be used as nouns inheadless phrases, as in (141), in which ¢/ refers to the head of the noun
phrase. When this occurs, the adjectives have stress typical of a noun, i.e.,
on the penultimate syllable, and the vowel degeminates as well. In (141),
the adjective phaimda ‘black’ takes nominal stress. Some adjectives can
function as nouns when preceded by the generic morpheme ne- as in (142).(141) cip*4ima piPia-rabi mi-?it'éeREF black

"9,9-9.12RelativeclausesEpena Pedee has internally headed relative clauses which, according to
Keenan (1985:163), are found only in SOV languages. The noun phrase which
acts as the head of the relative clause is followed by a restrictive clause which
in turn has the suffix that normally marks the noun phrase in the main clause.
The table in (674) lists the morphemes that mark the tense and subject
number on the verb of a relative clause. Present tense is indicated with a
relative clause form of the verb bj ‘be’ and past tense is indicated by using
the verb suffix -da. These morphemesare discussed further in §9.11.",[182]
"No discussion of event-line versus backgroundinformation is includedsince, as in other languages, event-line information generally has verbs withperfective aspect, whereas background
verbs with imperfective aspect.informationhas stative verbs or10.1. Demonstratives in discourse. The spatial versus social usage of
the demonstrative adjectives, manner adverbs and pronouns in Epena
Pedee has been described in §§4.4, 2.8, and 4.16, respectively. This sectionconsiders the discourse usages of demonstrative adjectives and pronouns,
which are similar to those described for Wounaan by Binder (1978).
Withina continuousdiscourse, forms of ha ‘that (there)’ and ma‘this,that’ are anaphoric, whereas na ‘this (here)’ is used cataphorically.
The discourse usages of the different demonstratives parallel their spatial
ones. Thus, just as na and ha refer spatially to objects which are visible, so
they refer to local segments of a discourse which immediately follow or
precede them. The various forms of ma, in contrast, refer anaphorically to
thematically important information. These usages are represented in (723).
na functions only on the local level. In narrative discourse, it is foundmostly within quotations, where it is used spatially. In (724), the narrator
refers to the ‘child’ with ma while, in the quotation of (725), the participant refers to him with na, because he is physically proximate.",[195]
"Parts of Speech25
2.7-2.9 AdverbsAdverbs include a broad range of words; they can be defined as
modifiers of constituents other than nouns. This section considers three
classes of adverb words in Epena Pedee: time; manner (including a set
derived from demonstrative pronouns); and location and direction. In
addition, there are other adverbs such as i¢iaba ‘also’.","[40, 41]"
"NounPhrase59Often, when someone is speaking about what he himself or another
person wants, the marked first- or second-person pronouns are used in
order to emphasize whose will is dominant. In the story from which (233)
is taken, the speaker turns into a monkey when he goes out to the field
to work. He uses the marked pronoun to emphasize that he wants to go
alone. In (234), he uses the marked second-person pronoun pici to emphasize the will of the other person.(233) mi-ti ituaba-tap""ee-pu-pa-ria-pa-¢iI-+

When a marked pronoun is used as a possessive adjective, possession is
emphasized; miéi is illustrated in (235). In (236), the marked possessive
adjective 4¢i emphasizes that it is their own language.(235) mi-citeawdra 60 — ata-it'ée-da_—_a-himy-+ house other make get-FUT-DECL say-PST

However, the use of the marked pronoun may also help the speaker
emphasize negative feelings. When speaking to a dog, one would use the
marked pronoun, as shown in (238). To use the same sentence even with
polite intonation when speaking to a person would be an insult.","[74, 75]"

He gave Juancito a small white donkey.
-m4-a also marks a location as the inherent goal of a verb of movement.
The verbs of these constructions contain morphemes indicating a change
in the location of the subject. In (271), the verb wa indicates movement
from one location to another, w4rda ‘upstream’ indicates the direction of
the movement,and -md-a marks hermandara‘nuns’ as the goal.(271) josé wa-hi warda

José went upstream to the nuns’ place.
The use of -md-a as a progressive morpheme (written as -m4a) modifying a verb instead of a noun phrase can be understood in terms of marking
an action progressing towards a predictable culmination or goal (see also68Epena Pedee Syntax§6.19). In (272), ‘dig out lizard eggs’ is the goal of the clause. The use of
-ma-a in adverbial constructions indicates termination of a time period. In
(273), -ma-a indicates completion of one week of time. In (274), -md-a
marks the adverbial clause, a clause describing an event that takes place
simultaneous with the main clause (see §9.1).

5.4. External goal. -it’ée marks noun phrases as benefactive and noun
phrases or adjectives as an external goal. It also marks dependent verb
phrases which indicate the ultimate purpose and indicates future tense in
independent verb phrases. Thus, -it’ée has a generalized meaning of external goal. When modifying a noun phrase or pronoun, the clitic -?it'ée and
the word it attaches to are separated by a glottal stop.
As the benefactive marker, -?it’ée indicates the noun phrase referring to
the participant for whom the action was performed. The verb tee ‘give’ is
used in the verb phrase when actual physical transfer of an object is
indicated, as in (275).(275) jose-Pit'ée mi-ahapa6o _ tee-hiJosé-for

"Thediscussionin this sectionislimited to the uses of the third-person pronouns in narratives. For consideration of the general uses of the unmarked and marked pronouns, see

There may be more than one major participant in a discourse. When the
storyteller wishes to give prominence to a particular one, that participant
is referred to with a marked pronoun, é¢i ‘he/she/it’, or 4ci ‘they’ (if plural).
However only one major participant (or one group of major participants,
if plural) may be prominent (i.e., marked) at any one time.
The sentence in (765) is from a story which has an old woman and two

A marked pronoun is changed to an unmarked pronoun when there is
a shift of attention away from the participant who was prominent. This
shift is sometimes accompanied by the use of mada (§10.2) or -ra (§5.13),
which often indicates a switch of focus.
In (766) and (767), a shift of attention is accompanied by mada. Prior to
this passage, two young men (the central characters of the story) enter a
village of wild Indians. Attention shifts in (766) from them to the wild
Indians and their chief. The wild Indians are referred to with the marked
possessive pronoun 4¢i (768), while the young men are referred to with the
unmarked pronoun dra ‘them’ (769).",[205]

in relation to the language universals presented by Greenberg (1966) and
Comrie (1981).
Epena Pedee is a fairly typical subject-object-verb (hereafter SOV) language. It is a member of Greenberg’s class 24 (1966:109), i.e., it has SOV
constituent order, postpositions, genitives (possessives) that precede the
noun head, and adjectives that follow the noun head. It is an agglutinative
language: words consist of morphemes that are readily segmentable, i.e.,
each morpheme is phonologically distinguishable from adjacent morphemes.","[24, 25]"

previously introduced participant is reintroduced in the same way in Epena
Pedee.) In (748), from a story of two brothers on a hunting trip, the new
participants first appear in the post-verb position.(748) map'étacuu-mda_bi-de&e-hi-daeperaa-rathat plantain cook-PROG be-LOC come-PST-PL person-PL

In (749), the introductory reference to the brother-in-law is in the
post-verb position, even though the normal pattern, preceding a quotation,
would be for the subject to precede the verb.","[199, 200]"
"NounPhrase55However, the sentence connectives in (213) (see §§8.2-8.6) are sometimes used as conjunctions as in (214) and (215).

a choice.(216) k’fa-ta= k*inia bi-ma~~ wéra__—wa _plarat'awhat-FOC want be-INTRG woman or
What do you want, a wife or money?silver4.12. Plurality. Plurality is always indicated in noun phrases which refer
to more than one human being. Noun phrases which do not refer to
human beings, whether the referent is animate or inanimate, are not
marked for plurality and may be either plural or singular. Plurality of the
subject is indicated by verb suffixes (see also §10.3). There are also
optional suffixes in the verb phrase that reflect the number of the object
(see §6.7). In addition, there is an intensified plural clitic to indicate a large
amount. These characteristics of plurality in the noun phrase are further
discussed and illustrated in the remainder of this section.
In (217), the subject is singular, as reflected in the pronoun and the
absence of the plural number indicator on the verb. The object pura
‘shrimp’ is a mass noun that takes the form characteristic of singulars.(217) mi-apurapee-hitap'édaI-ERG shrimp kill-PST early
I killed shrimp this morning.
The examples (218) and (219) have the plurality of the subject marked
by the clitic -ra (as well as on the verb), because the subject is human.
These clitics are almost always preceded by two or more vowels; if only56Epena Pedee Syntaxone vowel precedes, that vowel is usually lengthened. warra ‘son’ shown in
(219) is one of the few nouns that does not have the vowel preceding the
clitic -r4 lengthened.(218) eperaa-r4-patadama k'o-da-k""4aperson-PL-ERG snake eat-PL-NEG*HAB

1.13, Adposition order. As is typical of SOV languages, Epena adpositions (in brackets in (48) and (49)) follow the noun phrase. In (48), the
adposition follows the noun phrase ydoro té-de.","[30, 31]"

When he was going to be stabbed,...
The usage of marked and unmarked third-person pronouns in narratives
is further discussed in §10.4. First-person plural pronouns differ somewhat
in that the marked and unmarked forms have become identified with
inclusive and exclusive, respectively. In (240), inclusive usage (including the
person spoken to) is intended by the marked first-person plural pronoun
taci. The unmarked first-person pronoun fai in (241) excludes the person
spoken to.","[75, 76]"
"In a narrative discourse, ¢i generally refers to the last participant mentioned. In the sequence in (777)-(780), the participants are an old woman
(<6trda) and two boys (warrara), both of whom are mentioned in (777). In
(778), éi refers to the old woman (the thematic participant; see the marked
possessive pronoun /ci in (777)) as reference is made to the children.
Then, in (780), which expresses what the old woman was thinking, the
children are the referent of ¢/ as reference is made to their father and
mother.",[208]

As stated early in §§6.11-6.13, the tense suffixes of (400) are mutually
exclusive except for the future suffix, which occurs with present tense -ri
(and, in some cases, with the past tense, as will be shown below). In the
habitual construction of (424), the present tense suffix -ri is followed by
-it'ée to create a future tense habitual. In (425), -dari (completive) isfollowed again by -it'ée.

T will live inland.(425) nuinlandmi mimia-mda pa-dari-it’éetomorrow I work-PROG arrive-CMP-FUT
Tomorrow I should be working.
With paraphrastic expressions of past intention, the future tense morpheme is followed by the auxiliary verb pa and the past tense marker -hi
as in (426) and (427).(426) nu-wédamée_wa-it'ée pa-hiday-before jungle go-FUT AUX-PST

4.5, Indexing adjectives. The indexing adjective 4i (same specific) indicates that the referent is both specific and the same as before. It precedes
the noun it modifies, as illustrated in (172).(172) mé-ta4-waté-ik'aéere tebéik'o ba-hithat-FOC same-SPEC upstream-general side house stand
Now on that same side, upriver, a house was standing.be-PSTThe expression ainoréma literally, ‘the same specific day after’ is commonly used to refer to ‘the next day after that’. In this and other expressions of time and location, 4/ may occur in its variant form 4u.
To express ‘same kind of’, the -/ (specific) is dropped and -gée ‘kind of
is attached. In (173), agée modifies k'ay4a-pa ‘sick-INST’ to indicate that
Rosa’s husband had been suffering from the same kind of sickness that she
has now.(173) ¢iimik""ira p'op'ot'6o ewda aniba-hia-géekhayda-paREF man
lung
just heal be-PST same-kind sick-INST
Her husband’s lungs had recently healed from that same kind of
sickness.
4.6. Referential adjective. The referential adjective ¢i precedes the
heads of noun phrases and relates them to major participants (see §10.5).
It has no distinct pronominal form, although it is used in relative clauses
that lack nominal heads.!? The referent of ¢/ is often mentioned prior to
its use. In (174), imama ‘tiger’ is mentioned in the first sentence and ¢/ is
used in the second sentence to relate imik'ira ‘male, man’ to it.(174) miaimama pee-hi¢iimik""ira pa-hiT-ERG tiger
_kill-PST REF man
AUX-PST
I killed the tiger. It was a male (tiger).19m other languages of the Chocé family, linguists have called ci a demonstrative
clitic particle (Embera Sambu; Loewen 1958:101) and a definite article (Emberé;
Rasmussenand Mesiia 1985:124; Wounaan; Sanchez, Castro, and Binder 1977:23).","[62, 63]"
"Once a noun is mentioned in a story in Epena Pedee, it may be
preceded by a prenominal modifier (discussed in the sections above) or it
may have no modifier at all. In (183), the noun phrase o¢érro imi ‘lizard
eggs’ is first mentioned. In (184) (the next sentence in the story), that same
noun phrase is mentioned again without any prenominal modifier.(183) unu-na-hi otérro

(184)o¢érroimi ée-maabee-hilizard*sp egg dig“out-PROG be“INCEP-PST

4.7, Nouns modifying nouns. Nouns can also be modified by proper or
common nouns. The proper noun precedes the head noun. When a noun50Epena Pedee Syntaxis modified by a proper noun, a possessive relationship is indicated as seen
in (185).(185) joséakére wa-hiJosé father go-PST
José’s father left.
When a common noun modifies another noun, any combination of
nouns that is useful and makes sense in the language is acceptable. The
modifying noun precedes the head noun. In (186), te modifies k""iru.(186) te
housek*iru
leafroofing leaves or roof of a house
In (187), the head noun indicates the main idea of the noun phrase ‘a
mother’, while the modifying noun indicates ‘the kind of X’.
(187)sina néwe
pig mother
a mother pigSome nouns take on a somewhat different basic meaning when preceded
by a noun modifier. For example, the noun fe has the basic meaning
‘house’ or ‘man-made dwelling’. However, when preceded by some noun
modifiers, te has the meaning of ‘hollowed out thing’. The modifying noun
generally characterizes what the cavity is in. In (188), the cavity is in rock
and in (189), the cavity is in a tree. In (190), however, the modifier
indicates what possesses, makes, lives in, or uses the cavity or house (viz.,a bird).

1.16. Comparatives. The order of elements in a comparative is Standard—Marker—Adjective. This order is typical of SOV languages.
In (54), the standard (the noun phrase to which comparison is made) is
sidima ‘brown squirrel’, the marker is k’yd4ara (comparative), and the
adjective is tawaraa-ra ‘larger’.
