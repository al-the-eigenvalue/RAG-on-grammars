"Body parts
In principle all terms referring to body parts in Kakua are obligatorily
possessed; they must always be preceded by N-ǐʔ (the inalienable strategy of using
plain bound pronouns, shown in Table 5.5 above, is not used for body parts), or can
be bound to the possessor forming part-whole relations (see discussion for (105)
below), and body part terms used in numerals (see Chapter 7 for description of
numerals)
When the possessor of a body part is unspecified or unknown, the term
referring to such body parts must occur with the possessive pronoun for 3SG
masculine ʔãǰʔ= ‘3SG.M.POSS’:

fingers, feet (a description of Kakua numerals is given in Chapter 7). Although when
used as numerals body part terms are not considered as being possessed per se, the
bound construction may be akin to a possessive construction:

‘(they would) go hunt for five days’ (five = with one hand)têjʔjahand(five)Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 179
Compounding of two body part nouns serves a possessive function of the
part-whole type. Note that in this type of construction there is no use of a possessive
proclitic or possessive pronoun on either element. I interpret this lack of a possessor
on an otherwise obligatorily possessed noun as an indication that the compound in
itself is sufficient to express the possessive relationship, since the body part terms
are not occurring on their own as free roots. However, the different marking when
taking a proclitic pronoun sets them apart from inalienably possessed nouns, since
these body part terms do take possessive pronouns as opposed to inalienably
possessed kin term nouns:
104) mã̌w-deppâwa-idǐp-na
haʔ-jǔ‘gums’ (tooth-flesh)
‘ribs’ (rib-bone-PL)
‘beard’ (mouth-hair)As described in section §5.2 inanimate nouns can be specified for shape by
taking shape classifier suffixes. Body part terms are also specified for their shape as
illustrated in the following examples. In these compounds too, possessor marking is
absent, but I follow the same assumption made for the previous examples in (104)
above, where the compound in itself has a possessive function. In any case, nouns
referring to body parts do not occur on their own, and must have some kind of bound
morphology, be it a possessive pronoun, another noun (N-N), a noun classifier (NNclassifier), or other morphology:
105) mǎw-paʔawâw-daʔ
mɨh-naʔ
wɨ ̂-naʔ‘jaw’ (tooth-CL:concave)
‘head’(head-CL:round)
‘arm’ (arm-CL:tree)
‘leg’ (leg-CLːtree)B. Part-whole relationships
Nouns whose referents are considered to be inherently part of another referent
(like plant parts as seen in 5.2 above in the description of classifiers) are obligatorily
bound. In such constructions, N1 corresponds to the whole and N2 to its part (see
§5.1 above on noun compounding strategies and productivity). Examples of these
part-whole relations are given below:
106) ʔɨ ̃̌ʔ-tâʔ-kit
blowgun-base.of.blow.gun-CLːlog
‘mouth piece of the blowgun’
107) mɨh-fwẽ̌h
river-other.side
‘shore’180A Grammar of KakuaWhat sets these examples apart from inalienably possession is that when
possessed via a pronoun, the possessive pronoun is used, instead of the bound (nonpossessive) pronoun, which is exclusively the inalienable strategy. Thus, to express
that the mouth piece of the blowgun pertains to somebody, e.g., ‘my mouth piece of
̃̌
the blowgun’, the relation will be expressed as wiʔ=ʔɨ
̃̌ʔ-tâʔ-kit, using the possessive
form of the pronoun, and not as *wã=ʔɨ ̃̌ʔ-tâʔ-kit with the non-possessive pronoun.
C. Other obligatorily possessed entities
Terms referring to objects that are closely associated with people or that are
indispensable for subsistence are also inherently possessed. Therefore, nouns
referring to these elements must always be encoded within a possessive construction.
The set of other obligatorily possessed entities includes the followingː
i)
ii)
108) měm
2SGClan and language affiliation, family, friend-companion, shadow,
souls.

In addition to the strategies presented above for the expression of possessive
relations, Kakua encodes a possessive relation between nouns referring to animate
entities and a place to which the entity is affiliated (the ‘belonging’ of an animate
referent to a certain place). The morphemes marking this type of possessive relation
are called here associative markers. Associative markers are clitics that have a
singular form =bû ‘ASSOC.SG’, and a plural counterpart =mǔn ‘ASSOC.PL’:

Argument marking and case marking
6.0IntroductionThis Chapter presents a description of Kakua’s syntactic and morphological
strategies for coding grammatical relations of arguments, and also describes case
marking for adjuncts.
The grammatical relations of arguments in Kakua are marked by
morphological and syntactic means. An interesting characteristic of the coding of
grammatical relations in Kakua is its mixture of head-marking and dependentmarking strategies (in terms of Nichols 1986).
Subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb (a head-marking strategy),
while object arguments (encompassing any argument in a function other than
subject), receive case morphology, marked on the NPs themselves (a dependentmarking strategy, see examples 1-3 in Chapter 3).
Kakua’s alignment is strictly nominative-accusative. Object arguments and
adjuncts receive case marking. This is summarized in Table 6.1 below:

pronouns.
In the subsequent sections of this Chapter I provide a description of the
characteristics of the coding of grammatical relations and case markers in Kakua.
The expression of subject arguments is described in section §0. Object
arguments in Kakua are morphologically marked by case; this is described in §0.","[200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205]"
"Introduction: Kakua and its speakers3The morphology of Kakua is highly agglutinative (especially in its verbal
morphology), with a combination of head and dependent marking. The language is
predominantly suffixing, with a few prefixes occurring exclusively on the verb.
Kakua has cross-referencing proclitics that agree in person and number with the
Subject/Agent argument of the clause. Third person singular referents have,
additionally, gender agreement of feminine or masculine. Roots are often
compounded to form new words.
Parts of speech in Kakua can be divided into open classes (nouns and verbs),
and closed classes (adjectives, adverbs, numerals, interjections, and other particles).
Kakua nominal categories include number, classifiers, diminutive and
augmentative distinctions, and case marking. Nominalization is a highly productive
strategy to derive nouns from verbs. Animacy is particularly relevant for the system
of differential object marking and differential number marking. There are no
prefixing positions in the noun template, unless additional derivational processes
have been applied (Chapter 4).
Nouns can be further subdivided into alienable and inalienable classes, as
is evident from the system of possession marking (Chapter 5).
Most of Kakua morphology occurs in the verbal construction. There, prefixes,
suffixes and enclitics encode all of the tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality (TAME)
distinctions (clitics conveying TAME distinctions can also occur on other word
classes). Likewise, valency changing morphemes, verbal negation, cross-referencing
proclitics, and many markers of discourse also occur in the verb construction. Verb
roots can group together in a very productive grammatical strategy of verb
serialization.
Kakua’s most common constituent order is verb-final (S)OV, although other
orders are also allowed. It has a nominative-accusative alignment system.","[24, 25]"
"Alignment and word order309Compare this to the construction in (14), where the clause is formed by a single
predicate with the proclitic wã= ‘1SG’, indexing the subject argument of this
intransitive clause:
13) kǎn
ʔã=ʔêw=na=ka
3SG.M
3SG.M=sing=DECL=ASS
‘he is singing’
14) wã=pĩ-ʔɨm=na=ka
1SG=HAB-be.afraid=DECL=ASS
‘I’m always afraid’
Subject arguments can express the semantic roles of agents or experiencers.
Examples (15) and (16) show subject arguments of stative verbs in which the subject
arguments have the semantic role of ‘patient’, a prototypical semantic role of subjects
of stative verbs:
15) wěm
wã=pĩ-hêjʔ-weʔe-kan=be
1SG
1SG=HABT-know-NEG=REC.PST
‘I used to know’
16) wěm
bɨ
wã=tʃù-fwɨʔɨ
1sg
today
1SG=rest-TEL.PROG
‘I am, today, still resting’
Subjects of intransitive verbs of motion or active verbs prototypically have
the semantic role of agent. This is illustrated in example (17) below:
17) kǎn
ʔã=t-fwɨ ̂b-ʔǎb-beh=na
3SG.M
3SG.M=EVID-follow-go.up-go=DECL
‘he went back up again’
Finally, subjects of intransitive clauses involving verbs of mental or emotional
processes (or verbs of perception) prototypically have the semantic role of
experiencers. Examples (18)-(20) below give an illustration of these types of clauses
in Kakua:
18) kǎnʔ
mi=pĩ-tîk=na=ka
3SG.F
3SG.F=HAB-be.embarrassed=DECL=ASS
‘she is usually embarrassed’
19) wěm

kět
ʔĩ=t-wɨ ̂ʔi=dê=ka
night-other 3PL
3PL=EVID-be.surprised=INF.FUT.EVID=ASS
‘they might be surprised tomorrow’
Examples (12)-(20) above illustrate the expression of subject arguments in
intransitive clauses, showing that, although the subject noun phrase does not receive
morphological marking to indicate its grammatical function (i.e. no subject case
marker), the verb usually takes a cross-referencing proclitic encoding person and
number properties of the subject argument.
The expression of subject arguments in transitive clauses is illustrated in
examples (21)-(22), which show that the subject arguments are morphologically and
syntactically expressed in the same way as the subject arguments in the intransitive
clauses presented in (11)-(20) above. In (21) the subject argument expressed by the
NP wã=ʔibi ‘my uncle’ is the instigator of the action expressed by the transitive
verb tɨh ‘kill with blowgun’ performed on an object argument with the semantic role
of patient, which is morphologically marked with the object case marker =diʔ:
21) wã=ʔibi
wɨbɨ=diʔ
1SG=uncle bird.sp=OBJʔã=t-tɨh=na=tagǎ3SG.M=EVID-kill.with.blowgun=DECL=INF.EVIDtʃãhãpPROG‘my uncle must be hunting Curassow (bird.sp)’
Example (22) shows a similar type of clause, where the subject argument is
expressed both by the NP hiw ‘jaguar’, and indexed on the predicate with the
proclitic ‘3SG.M’, agreeing in person, number and gender with the subject argument:
22) hiw
mɨhiw=diʔ
ʔã=t-tʃãk=na=wɨt=be
jaguar dog=OBJ
3SG.M=EVID-bite=DECL=REP.EVID=REC.PST
‘the jaguar bit the dog, it is said’
The syntactic position of subject arguments in intransitive and transitive
clauses is preferably sentence-initial (see above). Additional examples are given in
(23)-(24), displaying constructions involving verbs of perception or mental
processes. In (23) the subject is a lexical noun cross-referenced on the verb by the
proclitic ʔã= ‘3SG.M’. In (24) the subject argument is a pronoun and is also crossreferenced on the verb:
S
O

‘he loved his daughter’311Vʔã=ʔûj3SG.M=care.aboutConsider now example (25), in which the subject argument is not expressed
through an NP, but indexed on the predicate of the clause only. In this case the
resulting constituent order is O s=V. Example (26) further illustrates the same order,
where the noun wãp ‘white capuchin’ is the object of the verb fwãʔ ‘find’, and the
subject is expressed by the proclitic fwĩ= ‘1PL’:

1PL=find-PST=REM.PST
‘we met the (evil spirit) white capuchin’11.4 Object alignment
Kakua marks its object arguments with the case marker enclitic =diʔ on the
object NP, i.e. a dependent-marking strategy, in terms of Nichols (1986). Unlike
subject arguments, object arguments are not indexed on the verb. Examples (27)(28) below illustrate object case marking:
27) měm=be
2SG=REC.PST
‘you taught me’wěm=diʔ1SG= OBJ28) wěm

different semantic roles.1 This is examplified in (29)-(32). (See further discussion on
semantic roles and object marking in Chapter 6). Example (29) shows an object
1See the comment in Chapter 6 regarding the possibility that the object marker =diɁ might haveother functions than marking object arguments, as it also occurs on noun phrases expressing source/goal,
as well as on other NPs that are not core arguments.","[329, 330, 331, 332]"
"A Grammar of Kakua192followed in order to establish other possible correlations between DOM and other
areas of the grammar6.1.1DOM and animacyThe oligatoriness of object marker in Kakua responds to the animacy of the
noun phrase in object function. Object marking is obligatory on all noun phrases
with human referents. On other object noun phrases, object marking is obligatory if
the object noun phrase is higher on the animacy hierarchy than the subject noun
phrase. Otherwise, the overt marking of object case is optional, and may be favored
by definiteness.
Object marking and its conditioning by animacy is a relatively common crosslinguistic phenomenon and in fact seems to have been the most widely explored
conditioning feature for differential object marking across languages, c.f., Comrie
(1989) for references in a broader typological view of DOM; Bossong (1980, 1991,
1998) for Romance, Turkic, some Indo-European languages, and languages of
Australia; Blake (2001) for some aspects of DOM in Hindi; England (1996) for
Mayan languages; for languages of the Vaupés see Aikhenvald (2003, 2012); Zúñiga
(2007), and Epps (2008); Comrie (2008) makes reference to alignment of case
marking in a typological perspective; Campbell & Grondona (2012) for languages
of the Chaco and the southern cone; and O’Connor & Muysken (2014) and Birchall
(2014) for an overview of languages of South America.
From these studies, we know that the higher the animacy of the object noun
within the hierarchy, the more likely it is that its marking will be obligatory. The
hierarchy governing this is reproduced below from Silverstein 1976 (see also Comrie
1989, and Croft 1991 for more discussion on animacy hierarchies):4
1 > 2 > 3 > Human > Animate > Inanimate
The rationale behind this is that entities lower on the animacy hierarchy are
very likely to be patients and thus objects therefore do not need to be overtly marked
as such. For instance, nouns referring to human entities are typically agents, whereas
inanimate nouns are typically patients. This disambiguates between agents and
patients in many cases. However, ambiguity can occur when two (or more)
arguments within a clause have potentially the same animacy and thus the possibility
to be agents, e.g. when the object argument has a human referent. This is the reason
why nouns referring to humans when functioning as the object(s) argument(s) of the
clause are obligatorily marked, also in Kakua.
DOM in Kakua conforms to this animacy hierarchy. All noun phrases with
human referents, including pronouns and demonstratives with human referents, are
obligatorily marked when in object function (demonstratives are obligatorily marked
also for a different reason, namely because they are definite, a pragmatic criterion
that favours the overt marking of object case; see §6.3.7 below). Nouns referring to
4Comrie (1989) notes also that pronouns do not really relate to animacy, but to referentiality.","[213, 214]"

‘he was the one who chased away the jaguars’ (he was the jaguar chaser)
The bound pronouns (proclitics) are normally bound to a head noun or verb.
When bound to verbs, the proclitics serve as cross-references to the subject argument
of the clause (see Chapter 6 on argument marking in Kakua).
The set of pronouns that are called “bound pronouns” can also occur without
being attached to a head noun or verb, but in this case the bound pronoun must
always be followed by another clitic to form a phonological word. The contexts
motivating the constructions of the pronouns without a head noun or verb need to be
explored in future research.
An example of the proclitic occurring with additional morphology only,
lacking a head noun or verb, is illustrated in (5) below:
5)fwɨb=bereturn=REC.PSTwã=beʔên=tâ=tikmâ-naʔtree-CL:treekanʔã=bewɨw3SG.M3SG.M=REC.PST caimanʔã=bewɨw1SG=recognize=INF.EVID=INTS
3SG.M=REC.PST caiman
‘I came back, (with) a stick I recognized the caiman, he must have been a
caiman!’
Unlike the free pronouns, the forms of the bound pronouns do not have lexical
tone specification; instead, their tone value is assigned by the elements in the
surrounding environment to which the proclitics are attached (usually the tonal value
is assigned by the roots to which the pronoun is clitized). In cases such as the one
presented in (5) above, where the bound pronoun lacks a head, and instead it occurs
only with other morphology, which are themselves also toneless, the entire set of
bound morphemes is realized with a low tone.
When pronominal forms function as subjects, objects, or comitative or
locative adjuncts they take case markers indicating their function within the clause:214A Grammar of Kakua6)kǎnʔkan=diʔ3SG.F
3SG.M=OBJ
‘She ate it’ (it is said)mi=t-hěmʔ-ep=wɨt=be3SG.F=EVID-eat-PST=REP.EVID=REC.PSTAs described in Chapter 5, (bound) pronouns can be used to indicate
possessive relationships. Inalienably possessed nouns take bound pronouns, while
alienably and inherently possessed nouns take the possessive (bound) pronouns (see
Chapter 5, §5.3, for description of possession). As mentioned in Chapter 5 (§5.3),
the possessive pronominal forms in Kakua are derived from a combination of the
bound forms of the pronouns with the possessor marker –íʔ. This is shown in Table
7.1 above in the column of possessive pronouns. An example of an alienably
possessed noun marked with the possessive bound pronoun is given in example (7)
below:
7) ʔãjʔ=namǎ=bǔ
3SG.M.POSS=path=LOCkǎn3SG.Mkãk=bɨtperson=ALSOʔãjʔ=namǎ=bǔ3SG.M.POSS=path=LOC
‘[they parted…], he (the armadillo) on his way, and the person also on his way’
Free pronominal forms do not have variants when used as possessive forms.
Kakua pronouns can have anaphoric functions, referring back to a previously
mentioned noun or noun phrase, as discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 (§11.2 on
subject alignment).
In Kakua narratives, usually a (3SG.M) pronoun is sufficient to refer to the
main participant of the story, and the expression of the participant as a lexical noun
is not necessary. Example (8) below illustrates a situation in which two participants
of the narrated event are being referred to by using 3SG.M pronouns only:
8)kǎnkǎn=diʔʔã=t-těw-hip=tagǎ3SG.M
3SG.M=OBJ
3SG.M=EVID-shot.darts-DUB=INF.EVID
‘he (the person) shot darts to him (the jaguar)’Like the demonstrative form kan (see above), the third person pronoun can
also be used for generic reference to inanimate entities in general, or abstract
concepts like thoughts, feelings, or ideas. The bound pronoun highlighted in bold in
̃̂
example (9), anaphorically refers to the derived noun higaɁ-at
be.sad-NMLZ
‘sadness’. It can also be translated into ‘it (the sadness)’. Example (10) illustrates an
instance of the pronoun kǎn used for generic anaphoric reference.","[234, 235, 236]"
"6.4.2 Comitative and instrumental
Expressions involving nominals in comitative or instrumental roles are coded
with the clitic =hĩʔ ~ =hiʔ.̃́ The difference between nominals in comitative versus
nominals in instrumental role in Kakua corresponds basically to the distinction of
whether the action is being performed together with a usually animate entity, versus
if the action is being performed using/by means of another entity (usually inanimate).
That is to say, a comitative interpretation of the morpheme clitic =hĩʔ, occurs when
a noun (usually animate) participates in an action together with the subject of the
clause: subject together with comitative performs an action.
The instrumental interpretation of the noun marked with =hĩʔ occurs when
something is being used by an Agent argument to perform an action: Action
performed with/using instrumental.
The syntactic structure of clauses involving comitative or instrumental
nominals do not differ one from the other.
Examples (79)-(80) illustrate cases of noun phrases in the comitative role. Note
that in these examples the object marker =diʔ is not used, showing that its
occurrence on comitative noun phrases is not governed by the same principles as
DOM, according to which they should be marked for being human.",[229]

The noun: morphology and structure
4.0IntroductionThis chapter describes the morphology of nouns and the syntactic position of
morphemes in the noun word.
Most of Kakua nouns are formed by monosyllabic (at most bisyllabic) roots
(c.f., §2.3, Chapter 2, on the syllabic structure of morphemes in Kakua); morphemes
with three or more syllables are exceptional and in most cases are lexical borrowings.
Kakua has a set of free and bound noun roots. A free noun root in Kakua can
be sufficient as a minimal nominal word; i.e., without need of additional morphology,
a bare noun root can function as head of a noun phrase, as an argument of a verb or
postposition, and also as a nominal modifier.
Kakua nouns can be specified for number, shape, possession, case, and
definiteness.
Nouns in Kakua do not take prefixes, and with the exception of proclitics, all
of the noun morphology in Kakua, as is the case for many Amazonian languages
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2012: 131), occurs exclusively after the stem. According to
Aikhenvald (2012:131), it seems to be a fairly common cross-linguistic tendency that
in predominantly suffixing languages, cross-referencing person-marking markers
will be the only morphology occurring in a pre-stem position. In the case of Kakua,
in which morphology is predominantly post-stem, the number of prefixes is very
limited (only two prefixing slots), and the cross-referencing person-marking markers
occur as proclitics.
Semantically, the elements belonging to the word class of nouns in Kakua
denote animate and inanimate entities, including abstract concepts, substances,
names (like proper and place names), natural and ecological phenomena, among
others.
This chapter is subdivided as follows: Section §4.1 introduces a description
of the two general types of nouns in Kakua: free and bound nouns. A template of the
noun in Kakua and its morphological categories, such as case, number, and
classification, is described in §4.2. This chapter ends with a description on the
different types of nominalization strategies in Kakua in section §4.3.","[147, 148, 149]"

Interrogative pronouns, as is the case for the rest of the pronominal forms in
Kakua, do not have different forms when functioning as subject, object, comitative,
locative, etc. Thus, if functioning as an object argument, for example, the
interrogative pronoun does not change its basic form and instead it optionally takes
the object case marker, compare examples (15) and (16) with (17) and (18) below:
17) dêʔe=diʔ=ti=be

Interrogative pronouns can take the possessive suffix -íʔ to encode possessive
relations, as in (19), or be compounded to a noun stem as in (20) below. Note that
in cases such as that illustrated in example (20) below, the interrogative pronoun is
not considered a procliticized form (as with the proclitic personal pronouns) because,
unlike proclitic personal pronouns (possessive personal pronouns), the interrogative
pronoun can stand on its own, like other interrogative words (i.e., can occur
syntactically unbound, like example (23) below where the interrogative dě ‘where’
occurs on its own. Most commonly, however, the interrogative pronouns occur
together with intensifiers or emphasis markers):

the interrogative forms: the inferred future evidentiality enclitic =dê ‘INF.FUT.EVID’;
and the noun dê ‘relative’ (‘person who is related). The extent to which these forms
may or may not be related is unknown.","[236, 237, 238]"
"11.3 Subject alignment
Subject arguments of intransitive verbs in Kakua are not treated distinctly
from those of transitive verbs. In other words, both A and S arguments behave in the
same way both morphologically and syntactically, exhibiting a prototypical
nominative-accusative type of morphosyntactic alignment: A=S≠P. Subject
arguments of a clause can be identified in two ways: they are NPs lacking
morphological marking for case (as opposed to other case-marked arguments), on
the one hand, and they trigger morphological agreement on the verb, on the other
hand. Compare the subject of the intransitive verb ʔêg ‘vomit’ in (11) with the subject
of the transitive verb hěmʔ ‘eat’ in (12) below. Note that in both cases the subject
argument is expressed by the pronoun kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ and it is indexed on the predicate
with the proclitic mi= ‘3SG.F’; the lack of morphological case marking and the
syntactic position of the subject noun phrase and the indexing on the verb seen in
the intransitive construction in (11) are the same as those in the transitive
construction in (12):
11) kǎnʔ

‘she ate the manioc bread, everything reallyǃ’
As mentioned above, a clause in Kakua can be formed by a subject and a
predicate, or by a predicate with a subject proclitic (in addition to no expression of
subject at all, if recoverable from the context). Consider the following intransitive
clauses. In (13) the subject argument is fully expressed with a free pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’ as well as indexed on the verb with the cross-referencing proclitic ã=
‘3SG.M’, which agrees in person, number and gender with the subject NP kǎn.",[329]

entity, namely the point of reference for the kinship relation. When the possessor is
unknown or unspecified, the inalienable construction is formed with the 3SG.M
proclitic pronoun ʔã=, expressing possession by an indeterminate being
(‘somebody’s kin’):

ʔã=wɨʔ̃̌
ʔã=ʔǐp‘his/somebody’s mother in law’
‘his/somebody’s son’
‘his/somebody’s father’Vocative forms of nouns do not express the possessor. Vocative forms of kin
terms thus are not possessed (they do not take any form of possession).
Vocative forms are typically formed by a reduplication of the stem vowel or
the insertion of a final [a] at the end of the stem. The last syllable receives high tone.
The criteria motivating the choice of the vowel quality – whether reduplication of
the stem vowel or insertion of final [a]-, is unclear at this point.
Vocative forms are presented here as variations of kin terms, and not as a
grammatical case in Kakua. Case in Kakua is a grammatical category which encodes
a certain grammatical function, and it is not the case for the vocative forms presented
in the list below. Vocative is not considered as a grammatical function, neither as a
suffix encoding a certain ‘vocative’ case. The forms presented here are limited to kin
terms and do not extend as a function (grammatical) case to other nouns. Examples
in (92) illustrate vocative forms of some kin terms. Note that the term for
sibling/cousin does not change in vocative vs. referential forms:

‘Manuel’s son! I (just) saw Manuel’s son!’Younger generations, however, ever more readily accept possessive
constructions of kin terms involving possessive pronouns, i.e. the set of special
possessive proclitics otherwise used only in alienable possession. This has not
extended to the entire set of kin terms, and the judgment for acceptability of kin
terms with possessive pronouns or bound (non-possessive) pronouns, is unclear. The
following forms were accepted by younger speakers, while rejected by older
generations:wã=fwan ~ wĩʔ=fwan
wã=pǔd ~ wĩʔ= pǔd
wã=ʔɨ ̂d ~ wĩʔ= ʔɨ ̂d
wã=ʔibi ~ wĩʔ=ʔibi‘my sister’
‘my cousin’
‘my younger brother’
‘my uncle’Although these forms were accepted by younger speakers, even they stated
that the constructions with the bound pronouns (not possessive pronouns), “sounded”
better. Forms that were not accepted by either group were: wã=ʔin (*wĩʔ=ʔibi) ‘my
mother’, and wã=mâ (*wĩʔ=mâ) ‘my parents’.
The use of regular pronoun forms, or juxtaposition of the possessor-possessed
entities without further special marking of possession as a means of expressing
possessors of kinship terms seems to be a fairly common strategy among many of
the languages of the Vaupés linguistic area (cf. Jones & Jones 1991: 61 for Barasano;
Ramirez 1997 for Tucano; Barnes 1999: 218, Miller 1999:48 and Silva 2012 for
Desano; Maxwell & Morse 1999, and Chacón 2012 for Cubeo; Stenzel 2004 for
Wanano; Ospina 2002 for Yuhup; Epps 2008 for Hup). While Kakua does not make
use of free pronominal forms for possessive constructions, its possession strategy for
kin terms is similar to that found in other Vaupés languages:Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 17795) Hup (Epps 2008: 234)ʔah̃́ =ʔíp1SG=father

Obligatorily possessed nouns are nouns considered as ‘inherently’ possessed,
that is, they must always occur within a possessor. Nouns that are inherently
(obligatorily) possessed differ from inalienable possession in that the former can
take possessive pronouns, whereas inalienably possessed nouns only occur with nonpossessive bound pronouns (proclitics) or bounded to its possessor (no marking of
possession neither by possessive suffix, nor by possessive pronouns). Additionally,
the possessor of inherently possessed nouns can be marked with the possessive suffix
-ǐʔ whenever the possessor is a full noun.
Inherently possessed nouns differ from alienable nouns in that, though both
use the same strategy for possession marking, inherently possessed nouns must
always be marked as possessed. The set of obligatorily possessed nouns includes the
following types of nouns:178A Grammar of Kakua

"5.3.1 Alienable possession
Alienable nouns are those that when possessed take the possessive form of
the pronouns (see Table 5.4 below), or can also be marked with the possessive suffix
-ǐɁ ‘POSS’. Most nouns in Kakua are possessed through this strategy. When the
possessor is a full noun, in an alienable possessive construction, the possessor is
suffixed with the possessive morpheme -ǐʔ (examples (85)-(86) below). Note that
this suffix could be called a genitive case marker. However, it occurs in a different
morphosyntactic slot than other case markers, i.e., because it occurs on the dependentNoun compounding, noun classification and possession 171
rather than the head of the NP. For this reason is best not to understand this suffix
as a grammatical case morpheme.

pronominal forms and the possessive suffix -ǐʔ (see Table 5.4 below. A description
of the pronominal paradigm in Kakua is given in Chapter 7).","[192, 193]"

A detailed discussion of nominalization strategies in Kakua is given below inPosition 3: Number marking
Kakua distinguishes between singular and non-singular. Singular is
unmarked. Non-singular number is marked by means of three different morphemes.
The choice of these morphemes depends on the semantics of the noun. Some nouns,
such as màɁ ‘water’, or běp ‘mud’ don’t take number marking, suggesting that they
form a set of mass nouns. However, the mass-count noun distinction in Kakua hat
not been studied further so far.
The plural suffix -na serves to encode plural number for most inanimate
nouns, as illustrated in (8)-(9):

‘houses’miʔ=nih-at-na3SG.F.POSS=say-NMLZ-PL

‘armadillos’
A small set of nouns occur with the plural suffix -nit, as illustrated in (12):12) nom–nit
bloodsucker.leech-PL
‘leeches’
The -nit suffix, is used to mark plurality for a small set of nouns that are
conceived as belonging to a group or as moving in groups or bands. Note that this is
not necessarily a group of smaller animals like leeches or mosquitos, but also
includes larger animals such as monkeys (though never human beings, or large
animals like tapirs, or jaguars), as in (13) below:
13) nakni
‘monkey (generic)’vs.nak-nit‘monkeys’Position 4: Possessive suffix -ǐʔ
This position is filled by the possessive suffix -ǐʔ. Possession of nouns in
Kakua is marked on the dependent element of the possessive construction, i.e. the
possessive suffix is attached to the possessor.

nouns. Positions 6 onwards are filled by enclitics that are not exclusive to the noun
word, and can be added to other parts of speech. These enclitics, which are not part
of the noun grammatical word, are presented below since they represent a part of the
phonological word for nouns. They are presented here to show the order in which
each of these enclitics attach to the nouns.1
Position 6: Case markers
Case markers in Kakua are enclitics that indicate object case, locative case,
and comitative/instrumental case. Case marking and grammatical relations are

"6.3.7 DOM and definiteness
Another typologically common condition on DOM is the definiteness of the
object argument (c.f., Comrie 1989; Iemmolo 2011), and the related notion of
specificity. By definiteness, I mean that the speaker assumes that the hearer can
identify the referent, by indefinite reference that he/she does not. Indefinite reference
can be further divided into specific reference and nonspecific reference. In the case
of specific reference the referent that cannot be identified by the speaker is known
to the speaker, in the case of nonspecific reference the referent is not known to the
speaker. A hierarchy for increasing likelihood of overt object marking relative to
definiteness and specificity is proposed by Croft (2003: 132) (see also Givón 1984:
387):definite < specific < nonspecific204A Grammar of KakuaNote that obligatoriness of object marking in Kakua is determined by animacy
(and whether it is a pronoun). In Kakua, the definiteness of a noun phrase increases
the likelihood that object case markers are used, but case marking on definite noun
phrases is still optional, as examples (47)-(49), among others, show. The following
example illustrates object marking on a definite noun phrase, where it is optional
according to animacy.

‘he heard when the jaguars were eating the turtle’ (the one that the man had left
behind)Example (64) below, illustrates the case where the argument hiw ‘jaguar’ has
no case marker, showing that in terms of animacy, it is optionally marked. The fact
that it is not definite, adds to the likelihood that it is not marked in this example.

Inanimate nouns are also more likely to be marked when definite, as in the
following examples (definite: (65) vs. indefinite: (66)). Note also that Kakua does
not have dedicated definite articles, and that having a pronoun preceding the noun
serves as definiteness marking:̃̌

"Elements of the noun phrase7.3219DemonstrativesKakua has a demonstrative system which makes three distinctions: proximate,
distal, and immediate proximate. The forms of demonstratives are given in Table 7.4
below:

be specified for gender if necessary (unlike immediate proximate forms, which are
already inflected for feminine gender in their basic form). In such cases, the classifier
-wili may be suffixed to the demonstrative form as follows: kan-wili ‘this (female)’,
and kun-wili ‘that (female)’.
Additionally, the 3rd person singular feminine personal pronoun, kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’,
can be used as a demonstrative when referring to female animate beings that are
(spatially) proximate to the speaker, and in such cases it is preferred over kan-wili.
As mentioned in §7.1 above regarding the 3rd person singular pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’, both kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kan ‘PROX.DEM’ can be used with the same deictic
meaning. It is also possible that the proximate demonstrative form kan was the
historical source of the pronominal forms kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ (following a
crosslinguistically common development of 3 rd person pronouns from
demonstrative), but the pronominal forms include further phonological
specifications, which suggests that a reverse development might also be possible.
The proximate demonstrative kan ‘PROX.DEM’ is used to refer to objects
which are spatially close to speaker, to the hearer or to both. It is not used for objects
immediately next to the speaker, for which the immediate proximate demonstrative,
nin or ninʔ, is used. The proximate demonstrative is also used to refer to something
that has already been mentioned in the discourse, e.g. ‘the one there’, or ‘this
aforementioned’ object. The proximate demonstrative can be translated as English
‘this’ or ‘there’, and is glossed as such where appropriate:

The proximate demonstrative form is a common variant of the third person

from the speaker, hearer, or both (32). Its alternate forms are kǔn and nun. The use
of the distal demonstrative is usually accompanied by a pointing gesture signaling
towards the (imagined, in the case of stories, for example) location of the referred
entity. The referent can be either visible or not visible to speaker and hearer. This
distal demonstrative has an alternate form nun as shown in Table 7.4 above. The
criteria conditioning the use of one over the other seem to correspond to clan dialectal
variation but need to be investigated further.

"Basic clause structure and types of clauses337Imperatives can also be used to give commands to other than a 2 nd person
(singular or plural) participants. This is done by adding the appropriate proclitic
pronoun in the imperative construction:
97) mi=Ɂên-é
3SG.F=see=IMP
‘may she see!’
98) mi=têw-é
3SG.F=work=IMP
‘may she work!’
Constituent order in imperative clauses is somewhat different from that in
declarative clauses. Imperative clauses do have a verb final order. But if the subject
argument is fully expressed by an NP, then the subject argument most often
immediately precedes the verb. It then follows the object rather than preceding it as
in other clauses, with an OSV order as the result. The fronting of the object argument
in an imperative clause is not an uncommon cross-linguistic feature of imperatives
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97). This ordering of imperative clauses in Kakua is
illustrated in examples (99)-(101) below:
99) kan=diʔ měm
3SG=OBJ 2SG
‘leave it!’ma= fwẽh-é2SG=leave-IMP100) bab-ni=diʔ

clauses in Kakua is the reported evidential =wɨt, possibly together with the prefix
t- ‘EVID’ (prefix of second hand, nonsensorial evidentiality. See Chapter 10 on
evidentiality) to express that the order has been given by someone other than the
speaker. The use of the reported evidential marker usually serves also to attenuate
the force of the command, making it a more polite imperative. This is often used
when directing orders to elders (102)-(103). Note that the additional evidentiality
specification forms a separate clause, so cannot be directly combined with the
imperative verb:338A Grammar of Kakua102) ma=tʃɨd-ɨ ̃́,

‘take (the manioc) out for grating, it is said’nih=wɨt=hĩsay=REP.EVID=REM.PSTIn fact, imperative clauses in Kakua lack all TAME distinctions in the clause
itself, and all of these distinctions form a separate clause. Cross-linguistically
speaking, this is not an uncommon characteristic of imperative clauses (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985).
An additional construction expressing imperative solicits the addressee to
perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The form of this imperative is
-áʔbuhú and it is glossed here as ‘IMP2’. In constructions using this morpheme, the
subject is always a second person, and its overt expression may be omitted. See
examples (104)-(105) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’. This
form can only code a ‘beneficial’ imperative, and no other benefactive or dative like
meanings can be drawn from it.

105) kǎn=diʔ ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
3SGM=OBJ take.out-IMP2
‘take (it) out for him’
Synchronically, -áʔbuhú is considered here to be one single morpheme.
However, because of the phonological (syllabic structure, vowel harmony) structure
of Kakua words, it is likely that that -áʔbuhú is historically at least a complex form.
The etymology of this imperative is not transparent.6
It might be a lexicalized combination of a morpheme -áʔ and the directional clitic=buh ‘DIR’.
The first element could be a phonologically reduced form of the negative suffix -kan, or it might
correspond to a morpheme that is no longer used in synchronic Kakua. Note that the negative suffix
doesn’t support a semantic motivation for this ‘beneficial’ imperative. Perhaps, the source of the proposed
first element -áɁ, expressed similar semantics of performing an action on behalf of a third party.
Nonetheless, there is no evidence neither in Kakua nor in its sister language Nɨkak that allows me to
strongly claim this hypothesis. The second element of this form would be the directional clitic =buh
‘DIR’, displaying the addition of a reduplicated vowel and high tone, i.e. the regular way to form
imperatives -Ṽ́. I propose the directional clitic as the most likely source of this element in this imperative
marker because of the semantics of this clitic, which comes from a verb root meaning ‘to perform an
action from a distance’ (see note at the end of Chapter 8 regarding the fuzzy verbal-directional identity
6Basic clause structure and types of clauses33912.12 Negative imperative
Negative imperative clauses require the negative imperative suffix -kabuhú.
This is also clearly a complex morpheme, historically derived from at least two
morphemes. The first part of this morpheme can be identified as the negative suffix
marker -kan/-kap. The second part, however, is less clear, and can have at least two
interpretations. Firstly, it may relate to the directional clitic =buh ‘DIR’, or to the
emphasis function of the clitic =bǔ ‘EMPH’ (see Chapter 8), plus a reduplication of
its vowel. As for now, I have no strong evidence for either of these hypotheses, but
what is clear is that (as with the second imperative described in §12.11 above), given
Kakua’s phonological and morphological rules, this particular negative imperative
morpheme can be considered historically as a complex form.
The negative imperative morpheme must immediately follow the verb root
(to which no affirmative imperative can be attached): (PN)=Verb-kabuhú :
106) ma=ʔɨm-kabuhú
2SG=be.afraid-NEG.IMPER
‘don’t be afraid!’of this morpheme). Thus, performing on behalf, or for the benefit of somebody else can be equated to
performing an action from a distance. Whenever the clause refers to this specific semantics of performing
an action for the benefit of somebody else, the imperative is expressed with this obscure morpheme
-áʔbuhú, thus it is considered here as one single complex morpheme. In constructions using this
morpheme, the subject argument of the clause is always in the second person, and it may be omitted. See
examples (i)-(ii) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’:

take.out-IMP2
‘take (it) out for him’
Since it seems to have a beneficial encoding (perform for the benefit of someone else), the following
considerations might be relevant for a future study of this imperative: i) Kakua does not have a dedicatedmarker for benefactive roles (see discussion in Chapter 6), ii) many Vaupés languages also do not have
dedicated markers for benefactive roles; iii) Kakua does not have a dative case marker (another possiblesource for the development of a benefactive encoding of a form). If the source were a dative case marker,however, it would be necessary to explain why and how a case marker becomes a verbal morpheme; iv)
many Vaupés languages have been described to lack a dative marker; v) Nɨkak, Kakua’s sister language,has been described as making five case distinctions, among which a dative; vi) Kakua, as many of its
neighboring groups in the Vaupés, makes three morphological distinctions, for case: Object arguments,Locatives, and Comitative and Instrumental; vii) Nɨkak’s dative marker is -éʔ (see Mahecha 2009); viii)
there is a regular sound correspondence of Nɨkak /e/ to Kakua /a/. This may be relevant for the complexbenefactive imperative form in Kakua -áʔbuhú; ix) because of Kakua’s phonological (syllabic structure,
vowel harmony) and morphological rules, we know that -áʔbuhú imperative is a complex form.","[357, 358, 359, 360]"

more objects co-occur in di-transitive constructions, both in terms of the use of the
object case marker =diʔ and the differential object marking that applies to it.
An example of a ditransitive construction is given in (33) below. This example
exhibits a typical ditransitive Kakua verb wɨʔ̃ ̌ ‘give’, exhibiting an agent-like subject
argument, and two objects, one of which is in a recipient (R) role, Gabí ‘Gabriel’,
and the other, dâwa-daʔ ‘ball-CL:round’ is in a theme (T) role. Two things are
important to note here. Firstly, note that all object arguments are marked with the
object case marker =diʔ. Secondly, note that all arguments occur before the verb:

Example (34) illustrates the ditransitive verb ʔɨ ̀b ‘bring’, taking two object

‘they brought her manioc from the manioc field, it is said’Alignment and word order313With respect to example (34) note, firstly, that the adjunct takes both the
locative case marker =bǔ and the object case marker =diʔ ‘OBJ’ (see Chapter 6).
Secondly, note that the adjunct precedes the verb. Additionally, note that the adjunct
occurs in between the two object arguments of the clause. This may be related to the
fact that there is no overt subject NP in this example. This example thus suggests
that Kakua prefers to place the adjunct preceding the verb, but not in clause-initial
position, adjuncts thus ending up in the second position within the clause. The
preferred ordering of constituents in clauses with adjuncts would then be as follows:
S[ADJUNCT]OV, or O[ADJUNCT]V, the second ordering being preferred whenever the
subject NP is absent.
Examples (33)-(34) also show that all arguments functioning as objects are
marked by the morpheme =diʔ, regardless of their semantic roles. In other words,
object arguments in the semantic roles of patient (P), theme (T), goals/recipients (R),
are all encoded by the same morpheme. As described in Chapter 6, the order of
object noun phrases encoding T, P or R is also free. The alignment of object
arguments is thus neutral (as in Croft 2003; Haspelmath 2005; Dryer 2007;
Malchukov et. al 2010).

Before illustrating DOM and personal names, it is important to first briefly
explain the various Kakua personal names. People usually have a vernacular name
which is regarded as a nickname and corresponds to either an animal that represents
them, or to the sound that a certain animal makes. Additionally, many people might
have a name given by the shaman, known as their ‘blessing name’. Nonetheless, with
the cultural changes incurring in Kakua’s present lives, many people have not been
given their blessing name; a blessing name is often a compound including cultural
terms as well as the name of an animal. All Kakuas are now also given a name in
Spanish.
During his or her lifetime, a person can go through several nicknames. The
blessing name is used by the shaman when a person is in need of traditional healing
prayers or prayers for the prevention of illnesses. Examples of these names are given
in Table 6.3.

Objects with the semantic roles of recipient were already illustrated in

recipients, in addition to beneficiaries, and maleficiaries in both transitive and
ditransitive clauses.
If both objects of a ditransitive clauses have similar status in terms of animacy,
both usually are marked with the object case marker (see §0 below on differential
object marking criteria). Example (16) illustrates an argument in object function with
the semantic role of recipient. Note also that example (19) shows a source (location)
being marked with the object case marker, this is further discussed below:̃̌

If both object arguments are expressed by noun phrases and both are marked
with the object case marker =diʔ (independently of their semantic role), the order
of constituents is fairly free, and speakers will judge as acceptable various different
alternate orders. See the following example, which was recorded from a conversation
(22)a and posteriorly rearranged and presented to speakers during elicitation (22)b:
22) a) Ɲɨjʔ-idip
ʔEbebʔ=diʔ
mɨ ̀=diʔ

ʔEbebʔ=diʔ
wɨʔ̀
Opossum-bone wild.pig=OBJ Venom=OBJ
give
‘Opossum Bone (ɲɨjʔidip) gives Venom (ʔebebʔ) a wild pig’
Both of these examples were judged by speakers to have the same meaning.
Both examples have two possible interpretations: ‘Opossum Bone gives wild pig to
Venom’ or ‘Opossum Bone gives Venom to wild pig’, where Opossum Bone and
Venom stand for proper names or nick names of two males, and wild pig refers to
an animal. This shows that the order of the two objects is free. In the case of example
(22), since the reading ‘Opossum Bone gives Venom to wild pig’ is pragmaticallyArgument marking and case marking 191
odd, speakers usually interpret this sentence with the reading ‘Opossum Bone gives
wild pig to Venom’ even when both readings are acceptable.
Even though the ordering of objects is syntactically free, I have observed
when doing elicitation that speakers tend to more readily accept an order in which
the participant with a lower/less agentive-like semantic role is placed to the left of
the argument with higher/more agentive semantics.
In addition to arguments in patient, theme, recipient, beneficiary, and
maleficiary roles, the object marker also occurs on noun phrases with the role of goal
(see example (41) below), and source as in (19) above.","[210, 211, 212, 213]"
"3.3.1 Pronouns
In this section I describe the pronominal paradigm in Kakua. This section is
intended as an overview only; for a detailed description and discussion of Kakua’s
pronominal forms and the pronominal system see Chapter 7.
Kakua has distinct forms for free and bound personal pronouns. Free
pronouns can function as arguments without the need for extra affixes. The bound
pronouns (proclitics) always precede a noun or verb. When cliticized to nouns, the
bound pronouns express possessors. When cliticized to verbs, the bound pronouns
function as cross-referencing proclitics of the subject argument of the clause. Unlike
the free pronouns, bound pronouns do not have tone specification by default and
instead their tone value is assigned by the elements following the bound pronoun.
Pronouns functioning as subject or object arguments of a clause take case
markers.",[132]
"6.4Case marking on adjuncts6.4.0 Case markers for adjuncts
The forms and semantic roles of adjuncts in Kakua are given in Table 6.5
below. Note that six semantic roles are coded by case markers for adjuncts: Locative,
Comitative/Instrumental (both coded by =hĩʔ), and Terminative:

"116A Grammar of KakuaIn Kakua, most attributive or quality meanings are expressed through
descriptive verbs. A small set of words which are not verbs and can be used directly
in attributive modification, however, can be identified.
The small set of adjectives in Kakua is formed by a total of four adjectives.
Morphologically, these words can take both verb and noun morphology.
Syntactically, the adjective words have a fairly free order and the modifier can occur
either preceding or following the modified noun.
The adjectives have a likely etymology in verbs, as discussed at the end of
this section. The four Kakua adjectives are given in (53) belowː
53) hàphâp
bɨdǐ
jehěp‘tall/up’
‘new’
‘big’
‘bad’All other qualities or attributive meanings in the language are expressed by
descriptive verbs. When a descriptive verb is used for expressing an attribute or
quality, the verb root is marked with the adjectivizer morpheme –ni following the
modified noun in juxtaposition.
The class of adjectives is distinct from verbs and nouns. Unlike verbs,
adjectives can occur as free morphemes without the need of derivational morphology
to function as modifiers of nouns. Unlike nouns, adjectives can take all of the verbal
morphology, and may function as heads of verb phrases.
The syntactic position of the four adjective words in Kakua is apparently not
fixed, and whereas some speakers prefer an N Adj order, others have no clear
preference for either one, accepting both as being just as good. It must be said,
however, that allowing for either order to occur is much more common in elicitations
than in natural texts, where the modifier tends to follow the modified noun. This
might be explained in that the four adjectives in Kakua have an etymological source
in verbs, and Kakua is predominantly a verb-final language.
The examples in (54) and (55) below illustrates a case in which the same
speaker uses indistinctly both Adj N and N Adj orders in the same narrative text:
54) bɨdǐ
big
‘big fish’kehfish55) jòaʔ

When descriptive verbs function as attributive modifiers, they are adjectivized
by the adjectivizer suffix –ni.
The following examples in (59) and (60) below illustrate this adjectival
function of descriptive verbs. Note also the order of constituents where the predicate
remains in final position whereas the adjectivized verb precedes the verb phrase.

Clan names, when used to refer to human referents, are also obligatorily
marked when in object function, as in (40) below. The human referent is a woman
from the parakeet clan ‘jeděʔ-wã ’ who was taken by the late uncle of the speaker:

Obligatory object marking extends to objects with the semantic role of goal
and source, when these refer to places of human settlements (41). In this example
the proper nouns Wacará and Wacurabá , two indigenous villages in the Vaupés, are
object marked with =diʔ indicating their function as object arguments.

Mythological beings and deities are treated in the same way as nouns with
human referents and thus treated in Kakua grammar just as the terms described in
sections §6.3.2 and §6.3.3. Mythological beings, as indicated above, can also includeA Grammar of Kakua198mythological animal beings. Mythological beings are obligatorily marked for object
case =diʔ when functioning as object arguments.
One of Kakua’s deities present in their myths of origin is ʔìdkamni.5 An
example of object marking on the name of this particular mythological being is given
below:

Additionally, terms denoting several forest spirits are also treated in the same
way as humans with regard to their animacy status and object marking. In (43)
speakers are discussing which one of the many stories about the Kuʔtʃilu can be told.
The Kuʔtʃilu is a mysterious forest being who has the ability to take people’s food
and destroy their houses without being seen. When the Kuʔtʃilu is approaching the
villages, he produces a loud horrifying noise that sounds like his name kuʔtʃilu,
kuʔtʃilu, kuʔtʃilu, and people flee away before his arrival:

‘Do you know the Kuʔtʃilu?’kuʔtʃilu=diʔKuʔtʃilu=OBJ6.3.5 Object marking on nouns referring to animals
Nouns referring to animals are obligatorily object-marked when the object
argument is of the same or a higher degree of animacy than the subject. Otherwise
object marking on these is optional. Animals can be divided into three sets
corresponding to three positions on the animacy hierarchy. A first set includes
animals considered to be originally siblings to humans (Table 6.4). A second set
includes large and medium sized animals (see short list in Table 6.5). And a third set
includes small-sized animals and insects. The first two sets are often marked, while
the third set may be said to be truly optionally marked for object case when in object
function. Exemplification of object marking on animal terms will be given in the
next section.
Kakua’s mythology considers a set of animals to be ancestral siblings to
humans (Table 6.4) (see Silverwood-Cope 1972 for a detailed description of Kakua
mythology). Therefore, terms referring to these animals could be expected to be
obligatorily marked when in object function. However, instances of nouns referring
to these ancestral siblings that lack an object case marker when in object function5The etymology of this name is not transparent, and it appears that many morphological fusionshave occurred. A possible interpretation is to translate this name as ‘the old bone person’ from ʔid ‘bone’,kãk ‘person’, mâ ‘be.old’, -ni ‘AG.NMLZ’. A deity name with similar translations seems to be widespreadamong the mythologies of many Vaupés groups (c.f., Epps & Stenzel 2013).","[217, 218, 219, 220]"
"120A Grammar of Kakuaa separate class from verbs and nouns. Finally, adjectives in Kakua can function as
verbs, taking all the available verbal morphology, suggesting that adjectives in Kakua
have a verbal origin.
The same argument given above to account for the derivation of the adjective
words hâp ‘new’, and hap ‘tall/up’, can serve to explain the diachronic development
of the adjective word jehěp ‘bad’. It could be argued that jehěp ‘bad’ is a lexicalized
form from the verb jěh ‘be.damaged’ plus the general past marker –Vp: jěh-ep
‘be.damaged-PST’. Because of phonological processes, the realization of a rising tone
in a bisyllabic morpheme is assigned to the last syllable, and thus, the tone of the
verb root jěh ‘be.damaged’ has its realization in the last syllable when it has been
lexicalized as a bisyllabic adjective jehěp.
The word jehěp can function as an adjective or as a verb, as shown in (70).

Perhaps the least etymologically transparent of the four adjectives in Kakua
is bɨdǐ ‘big’. However, even when its source is not clear, the fact that it can occur
both as a verb and as a free form (adjective), without the need of the adjectivizer
marker –ni, can serve as a sign to suspect its verbal origin. I acknowledge, however
that it is cross-linguistically common for adjective to share properties with either
nouns or verbs. My argument is based on the large number of descriptive verbs that
in Kakua serve to describe properties of nouns.
The examples in (71)-(73) below illustrate the adjective bɨdǐ ‘big’ used as an
attributive modifier (with animate and inanimate entities):
71) teluʧaʔ

Like some verbs, the adjective bɨdǐ can also function as an adverb. When
functioning as an adverb, bɨdǐ occurs at the beginning of the clause, as in examples
(74) and (75) below, and its semantic meaning is that of ‘very much’:Types of morphemes and word classeŝ

The main features of the closed class of adjectives can be listed as follows:
a) Adjectival concepts in Kakua are generally expressed through descriptive verbs.
b) Attributive modification is expressed by adjectivized verbs, noun compounding
or noun classification.
c) The adjectivizer suffix is –ni. It can be attached to (descriptive) verb roots to
form adjectives. When attached to other verb roots (other than descriptive
verbs), it can also function as agent nominalization.
d) The adjective or adjectivized element has free syntactic order, although normally
it follows the modified element, it may also precede it.
e) The four adjectives identified in Kakua are items expressing the notions of ‘big’,
‘tall/up’, ‘new’, and ‘bad’. These four forms can be used as free forms (as
attributive concepts or modifiers), or as heads of a predicative construction.
f) The four attested adjectives do not take pronominal prefixes.
g) They share a number of features with verbs and some other features with nouns.
Unlike nouns, adjectives can take verbal morphology and can be nominalized.
And unlike verbs, adjectives can take nominal morphology.
h) Adjectives are synchronically monomorphemic, but some are probably
historically derived3.3.6 Adverbs
Like in the case for quality or attributive modification, modification of verbs
and clauses in Kakua is mostly expressed by verbs. However, there is a set of words
that are not verbs and that can also serve to modify verbs and clauses. These adverbs
are morphosyntactically different from verbs and nouns.
Although most members of this set of words have a clear etymological source
in verbs, they can be morphosyntactically distinguished from verbs in that they can
occur as free morphemes, whereas verbs must always occur with additional
inflectional morphology (see Chapter 8 for discussion of the exceptional cases when
verb roots can occur as free morphemes).
Most adverbs can constitute a sentence on their own, like nouns. Unlike
nouns, however, some adverbs cannot take case marking. Also, unlike nouns,
adverbs can take verbal morphology.
On the basis of their syntactic behavior adverbs can be divided into two sets.
A set of adverbs that occurs at the beginning of the clause they modify, and a set of
adverbs that occur as particles at the end of the clause that they modify.","[141, 142, 143]"
"3.3.3 Demonstrative pronouns
Kakua has a three-term demonstrative system: proximate, distal, and
proximate emphatic. Gender inflection for demonstratives in Kakua only occurs in
the proximate emphatic demonstrative pronoun.
Table 3.9 shows the forms of demonstrative pronouns in Kakua.

FunctionForm Demonstrative PronounkanProximate ‘there/this’kun ~ nunDistal ‘that’
Proximate
emphaticmasculine ‘this

feminine ‘this

which are close (though not immediately next to) to the speaker, to the hearer or to
both. Also, it is used to refer to something that has already been mentioned in the
discourse, e.g. ‘the one there’, or ‘this aforementioned’ object. The meaning of this
proximate demonstrative can be translated as English ‘here’ or ‘there’:
46) kan=jǔb=pûʔba
there=INTS=EMPH
‘right there, all right!’
The distal demonstrative is used to refer to objects far away from speaker,
hearer, or both. This distal demonstrative is usually also accompanied by a pointing
gesture towards the distant referent. The referent can be either visible or not visible
to speaker and hearer. An example is given below:A Grammar of Kakua114
47) pɨkun=nawɨ ̌d-daʔthat=DECL
sloth-CLːround
‘to that Sloth hill’ (speaker points to the place where the Sloth hill is supposed
to be, although it is not visible from the point where the speech act is taking
place)
TERMThe emphatic proximal demonstrative is used to refer to a referent that is
immediately proximate to the speaker or hearer. It is also used to refer to the last
element/participant previously mentioned in the discourse, like the latter in English.
Constructions involving the emphatic proximate often imply that the object is within
reachable distance, e.g. this very bark right here. The emphatic proximate
demonstrative has specific forms for feminine and masculine referents. It can be used
to refer to animate as well as to inanimate entities. Examples are given in (48)-(50):

Numerals are built up by compounding noun roots (or adjectivized or
nominalized verb roots), plus additional noun morphology such as case marking,
number marking, and classifiers, among others. The numerals 5 and above involve
a generative system consisting of adding terms for fingers and hands to the basic 15 forms.
The Kakua numeral system has native forms to express numerals from 1 to
20. Although Kakua speakers have reported that this numeral system can be extended
to count for higher numbers than 20, by adding terms of body parts of other
individuals (‘two hands and two feet and one hand from another person’), in actual
practice any quantity beyond five is expressed by using Spanish loans.
A list of the Kakua cardinal numbers 1-5 is given in Table 3.10 below. A
comprehensive list of all 20 cardinal numbers in Kakua and a detail description of
the numeral system is given in Chapter 7.","[135, 136]"
"I have chosen to give different glosses here, even though it might be the case that the suffix
-ni is actually acting as a nominalizer in both cases. If this was the case, examples like the one in (60)
could be interpreted as ‘the ripe one’ (i.e. a noun-noun compound). Likewise, example in (61) dɨw-ni ‘the
carrier’ could be interpreted as ‘(the one who is a) carrier'. It may thus be that the difference between
what I am labeling ‘ADJVZ’ versus ‘A.NMLZ’ has to do merely with the modifier vs. head status of the
element taking -ni (and maybe the active vs. stative status of the verb that is undergoing the derivation),
as opposed to an actual dual function of the suffix. Therefore, the difference in glossing does not
necessarily reflect a strong distinction in the function of this suffix, but rather, it is used to indicate the
type of derivation best reflects the translation.

Before concluding this section on Kakua adjectives, the following paragraphs
discuss the origins of Kakua adjectives.
Synchronically Kakua adjectives behave differently from descriptive verbs,
but good hypotheses can be made with regard to the etymological origin of these
words.
The adjectives hap ‘tall/up’, and hâp ‘new’ could be derived from the spatial
noun hâbʔ ‘up river’. In this case, hypothetically, the noun hâbʔ ‘up river’ developed
tone differentiations as well as the devoicing of the final consonant. However, an
argument for a reverse process can also be proposed. In other words, it could also
be that the spatial noun hâbʔ ‘up river’ has been derived from the adjectives hap
‘tall/up’ and/or hâp ‘new’. This last argument, however, does not explain why other
spatial nouns have no clear resemblances with adjectives. 6 I consider these to be less
likely scenarios for the development of these adjectives. An alternative scenario
follows.
Another possible scenario is that both hap and hâp derived from the verb hâ
‘to get up’ plus the past marker of verbs, -Vp, resulting in the inflected form hâ-ap
‘get.up-PST’. This is a more likely scenario, for at least three reasons: First, because
it is consistent with the general pattern that adjectival concepts are expressed through
descriptive verbs, so that one may expect that the attributive concepts ‘tall, up, new’
have initially been descriptive verbs. Second, because it is consistent with the
analysis for the other two Kakua adjectives bɨdǐ ‘big’and jehěp ‘bad’, which will
leave us with one general explanation for the origin of a closed class of adjectives,
coming from verbs, instead of several different strategies for obtaining adjectives as
6Note that in either of these scenarios the semantic link of ‘new’ remains unclear.","[140, 141]"
"106A Grammar of KakuaOnly nouns can be possessed (alienable/inalienable possession. Possession is
described in Chapter 5). Example in (29) below illustrates possession on a
nominalized verb. Example (30) shows possession on a noun:

Colombia-POSS-mouth=OBJ
‘I did not know any Spanish’ (I didn’t know any Colombian mouth)
The strategy for negation in nouns differs from that of verbs in that verbal
negation is marked with the negation suffix -kan, while the negation of nouns is
expressed through existential negation,3 as in (31):
31) kět webit wîʔi-kan
yegěʔ wîʔi-kan
3PL child

clothes not.exist-NEG
‘They don’t have children and don’t have clothes’
It is also an exclusive characteristic of nouns that they can be modified by
numerals, or take quantifiers. Additionally, numerals and quantifiers can themselves
function as head of noun phrases.
Finally, noun compounding is a productive strategy in Kakua of derivation or
to express possessive relations. Noun compounding is described in Chapter 5.
The following list summarizes the main properties of nouns in Kakua.
Properties summarized in (a)-(c) are exclusive to nouns; these properties also apply
to derived nouns, but the underived noun roots are most relevant for establishing the
difference between word classes. Properties summarized in (d) and (e) are properties
shared between nouns and verbs.
a)Semantically: they refer to human beings, places, things, animate & inanimate
entities, abstract notions
b) Syntactically: nouns function as heads of noun phrases. Noun phrases can
function as arguments. Inflection for case occurs only on the noun phrase and
on adjectives, and on verbs only when they are functioning a complements (see
Chapter 13 on complement clauses).
c) Morphologicallyː there is a smaller repertoire of bound morphology that can
combine with nouns than the repertoire of morphology that combines with verbs.
The morphology of nouns includes the marking of number, shape and/or case.
Nouns do not take prefixes.

It is very likely that using the same morpheme to code nouns in comitative
and instrumental roles, responds to an iconic motivation of the close semantic
relatedness between these two concepts. Example (85) below illustrates an instance
that can be interpreted as both instrumental or comitative. It is extracted from a
conversation, where the speaker is telling about his hunting trip, during which he
found an alligator and chopped off the tail of the animal. In a joking manner he tells
his interlocutor that the tip of the alligator (full of leeches) was tasty to eat together
with manioc bread, or by using the manioc bread to push up the leeches on the
alligator’s tail. Both readings where suggested by the speaker who helped with the
translation of this text:

Kakua codes terminative locatives with the preposition pɨ ‘TERM’. This
morpheme is particular in its semantics and its syntax. Semantically, it has a very
narrow meaning, similar to English up until. Terminatives are used to refer to a
specific spatial or temporal location which is situated within a space or time that has
a further continuation. For example, ‘we will walk up until the house’, implying that
there is a path that goes beyond the house, but that our journey will go only up until
where the house is:pɨ

Similarly, for temporal senses, it can be used to refer to a specific time during
a specific event, such as I slept up until 7am, implying that the timeframe of the
story continues, but the sleeping was terminated at 7am. The example is given in
(89) below:

‘(I slept) up until 7am, at seven really, I went first thing in the morning up until

Syntactically, the terminative marker is unique in that it functions as a
preposition, while no other prepositions are attested in Kakua.","[229, 230, 231, 232]"
"3.1.1 Identifying affixes and clitics
A property common to affixes and clitics is that there are no pauses in
between these formatives and their hosts. The main syntactic characteristic that
differentiates affixes from clitics in Kakua is that clitics, unlike affixes, can attach to
different hosts. The ‘freedom of host selection’ is a defining characteristic of
prototypical clitics cross-linguistically (cf. Bickel & Nichols 2007: 174, see also
Haspelmath & Sims 2010: 197ff.). Affixes, on the other hand, have a much more
restricted syntactic distribution and are, for the most part, exclusive to a particular98A Grammar of Kakuaparts of speech. An overview of some of the clitic morphemes and their hosts is

Some morphemes, described here as clitics (such as the case of the clitic=buh ‘action from far’, which encodes the meaning of an action that is performed
from a distance far from the actor) do not satisfy the criteria of freedom of hostTypes of morphemes and word classes99selection. However, they are still being described as clitics here, because they occur
after a string of clitic positions of their host. Thus, describing them as affixes would
fail to account for the identity of the morphemes (clitics) which precede these set of
clitics which do not have freedom of host selection.
The status of case markers as clitics vs. affixes will be discussed in some
detail here, as one example how clitics can be distinguished from affixes in Kakua.
Case markers have freedom of host selection in that they attach to nouns and
adjectives (which share some, but not all characteristics of nouns, see section 3.3.5).
On the other hand, case markers may only occur on verbs if these are in the
subordinate clause (see Chapter 12 for a description of subordinate clauses in
Kakua). Case markers also display a greater freedom of movement than affixes in
two further respects. Firstly, they can occur on only one element of the noun phrase,
rather than on each individual elements of the noun phrase (examples (4)-(8), which
can be the second (4)-(6) or the first element (7).

Normally, the remote past clitic occurs at the very end of a construction. These
examples are not common. I only have gathered a few. One such is:

(long ago when the eclipse was passing) they asked the dead cadaver’ (Spanish
‘el cadaver finado’)Affixes, unlike any other type of morpheme in Kakua (this includes clitics
and all of the word classes), can have syllables without onsets (see Table 3.3 below),
or consist of just a consonant (Table 3.4). Also, only affixes can have unspecified
vowels in their underlying structure. Thus, they allow for the copying of the vowel
quality of the host to which they attach. As mentioned above, affixes do not have
freedom of host selection. A list illustrating some representative examples of suffixes
in Kakua and their hosts is given in Table 3.3 below:

violate the phonological restriction in Kakua that disallows consonant clusters. Note
that exceptions to phonological restrictions in Kakua occur for other affixes as well
(e.g. vowel copying and the onset-less syllables mentioned above). In what follows
of this section, I present a set of three enclitics that can attach to various word classes
to express emphasis or intensity of that constituent. These forms are: = jǔb, which
serves as an intensifier to nouns, with the semantic meaning of ‘truly’, or ‘really’.
Example (9) illustrates this verb root jǔb ‘be true’, from which this intensifier
derives, occurring within a verbal construction. Example (10) shows the function of
=jǔb as an intensifier of a pronoun:

are full of the intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ. Its meaning is that of an affirmation
such as ‘truly’ or ‘exactly’. This intensifier =ti can also occur with both, nouns and
verbs:̌ ʔ=hĩ=tiʔ

The intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ occurs commonly in interrogative clauses,

Nouns and verbs conform the two open classes of words in Kakua.
The elements of the open word classes in Kakua have, in principle, an
unlimited membership. That is to say, the open classes of words in Kakua may
include not only native words, but also readily accept borrowings, calques, and any
other type of new lexical items such as words newly formed by semantic extensions
or by the lexicalization of formerly more complex words (e.g., historical compounds
that have undergone morphological and/or phonological fusion to form one complex
lexical item).
The main element of the members of open classes is a noun or verb root that
heads the noun or verb phrase accordingly.
Roots can be further divided into those that can occur as free elements and
those that are obligatorily bound with inflectional or derivational morphology
(Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the different free and obligatorily bound noun roots. Verb
are described in Chapters 8 and 9).
In this study a free morpheme is understood as an element that is
phonologically independent, i.e. it is not obligatorily bound to another free
morpheme or to other bound morphology in order to form a full word.
A major distinction between Kakua noun and verb roots concerns the
morphology each of these requires. Kakua nouns are formed by a free root that can
occur without the need of additional morphology. Verbs, on the other hand, require
for the most part a more complex morphology.
The main semantic, phonological, syntactic and morphological characteristics
of Kakua nouns and verbs are described in the following subsections. Subsection
§3.2.1 describes these main characteristics that define Kakua nouns. §3.2.2 deals
with the main properties that characterize verbs.","[119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"Object case =diʔ6.2.0 Introduction
Arguments functioning as objects are in principle marked with the case clitic=diʔ ‘OBJ’. The object case marker may be omitted under specific semantic anddiscourse conditions, which determine differential object marking in Kakua. These
criteria are described in section §0. Arguments marked with =diʔ ‘OBJ’ can express
several different semantic roles such as patients, recipients, beneficiaries,
maleficiaries and other affected roles. This also implies that the two objects of
ditransitive predicates are not differentiated in terms of case marking, all are marked
with the case marker =diʔ ‘OBJ’. The following sections give a set of examples
illustrating the different semantic roles that can be expressed by the object marker
=diʔ. Subsection (§6.2.2) presents object marking on prototypical patients and
themes. Section §6.2.3 presents object marking on prototypical recipients,
beneficiaries and maleficiaries.",[210]
"10.6.2 Nonvisual evidentiality
Nonvisual evidentiality in Kakua is a category which indicates that the
situation was experienced by the speaker on a firsthand basis through sensorial means
other than visual. Nonvisual sensorial means include those of smelling, hearing,
tasting, or feeling through the skin. As opposed to the reported category, which refers
to a situation in which a speech report concerning the event was heard, ‘hearing’ in
the nonvisual category implies that the speaker directly heard the situation taking
place. To indicate nonvisual evidentiality, the prefix ĩ- is used (as shown in (87)
above), and it is glossed here as ‘NON.VIS’. This form does not occur very often in
my data.13 It was given to me especially in elicitation sessions, but in texts of
conversations, narratives, etc., its occurrence is very limited. Some examples are
presented below in (88) and (89) from natural text, and in (90) from elicitation:

‘he is coming’ (His noise gives him away, the speaker can hear him coming)
Perhaps an evaluation of the different speech genres or speech situations, such as conversations,
narratives, etc, and their interaction with different tenses, can give a clearer picture regarding the use of
this evidential marker.
13Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality297One’s own personal states, such as feelings, or thoughts, however, are not
marked with this nonvisual evidential prefix. Instead, the unmarked form (visual) is
used. This seems to be the opposite of the common prediction of the nonvisual
category in some of the Vaupés languages (see for example Ramirez 1997 for
Tukano, Epps 2008 for Hup).
As the examples above show, the use of this nonvisual evidential is not
restricted to the first person, as it can refer to situations being performed by a third
person (as in (87) and (90) above). In these examples the event is being undertaken
by a third person, but the evidential indicates that the speaker is basing her
knowledge of the situation on her own sensorial experience of the situation taking
place, that is, the speaker hears the event taking place and presents it as such, though
the event is not being carried out by the speaker herself.
In some languages with evidentiality systems, the nonvisual evidential is
derived from verbs of perception such as ‘hear’, or ‘see’ (c.f., Aikhenvald
2004:174f). The nonvisual evidential marker in Kakua does not have a clear
etymological source, either within Kakua or in Nɨkak. In Nɨkak no such category has
been reported, nor are there verbs in Kakua meaning ‘see’ or ‘hear’ that could be
related to Kakua ĩ-, in the data that I have gathered for Kakua.
Finally, it is also important to note that a nonvisual category encoding
information which was directly experienced by the speaker (by sensorial means
different from visual), has been described for many languages of the Vaupés area
(c.f., Barnes 1990 for Tuyuca, Ramirez 1997 for Tukano, Aikhenvald 2003, 2004 for
Tariana; Epps 2008 for Hup among others). This brings up the possibility that the
nonvisual evidential prefix in Kakua might reflect an areal feature. If there is a
correlation of the nonvisual evidential in Kakua with those of its neighboring
languages, I propose that it is likely that the prefix was already in the language before
Kakua came in contact with Tukanoan languages. Perhaps the prefix had a different
meaning, but in any case I am more inclined to think that the form itself is unlikely
to be to a borrowing. I propose this for two reasons:
i)on the one hand, the few (identifiable) morphological borrowings in
Kakua (with the exception of the terminative preposition pɨ ‘TERM’, see
Chapter 12), correspond to forms that occur after the stem, primarily
because most of the languages spoken in the Vaupés area do not have
prefixing positions;14 thus, if the nonvisual prefix in Kakua were to
correspond to a borrowing from a neighboring language, it would be
somehow strange to adopt it as a prefix in Kakua, instead of as a poststem form if it came from a suffix. If it came from a prefix, it would
be easily identifiable from the source language.
Kakua has a limited number of prefixes, and at least one of them (the
habitual marker) can be said to be a form inherited from proto Kakua-ii)Gómez-Imbert, in personal communication, mentioned that Barasana (ET), for example has
some prefixing positions. It is not, however, a widespread pattern of languages spoken in the Vaupés,
which are mainly suffixing languages.
14298A Grammar of Kakua
Nɨkakan. It will be difficult to strongly support an argument in which,
instead of considering prefixing forms as a shared feature in the protolanguage, these prefixing forms in Kakua were to be considered an
innovation entering Kakua through contact with neighboring Vaupés
languages, when what has been noted mostly is that Kakua has
borrowed quite a few suffixing or post-stem forms.","[317, 318, 319]"
"11.5 Summary
The word order and alignment of arguments in Kakua can be summarized as
follows:
 Kakua shows a strong preference for the SOV ordering of its constituents.
Alternative orders follow a preferentiality scale, from most preferred SOV to
least preferred (but attested with restrictions) VOS.
 Most preferred orders are verb-final, with objects preceding the verb.
 The coding of subject arguments is of the head-marking type.
 Subject arguments are not morphologically marked for case.
 Kakua A arguments and S arguments are not different morphosyntactically. This
conforms to a typical nominative-accusative type of alignment, where A and S
arguments are equal, while different from P arguments: A=S≠P.",[334]
"320A Grammar of Kakua12.5Comparative constructionsThe function of comparative constructions in Kakua is to assign the relative
position of two referents on a predicative scale. Comparative constructions,
according to the terminology used in Stassen (1985), involve the following elements:
the standard of comparison (the NP indicating the object that serves as the yardstick
of the comparison); the comparee (the object that is being compared); the parameter
(the property on which the comparison is based), and the index (referring to the type
of comparison). The last two, i.e. the parameter and the index, are referred to as the
scale.
Kakua comparative constructions include those in which the scale of
comparison expresses standards referred to as being less than, more than, and equal
to the compared entity. In these types of constructions, the scale is expressed by verb
roots, without additional TAME morphology, affixes or proclitics. In these cases, the
verb root by itself indicates the scale of comparison. Examples (27)-(29) illustrate
the use of the verb tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’ not functioning as a predicate, but as a scale for
comparison. The order of constituents in comparative constructions is as follows: the
comparee precedes the standard, and the position of the scale of comparison (e.g.,
tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’) is free.

comparison meaning ‘be less than’. Note that in these examples, as in (27)-(29) above
and (30) below, the verb expressing the scale for comparison does not take additional
TAM affixes and its function within the clause is not that of a predicate, but of a
scale of comparison:Basic clause structure and types of clauses

be.alike this.F
‘like this short, the younger brother was shorter (than the older ones), just like
Chavela’
Semblative comparison, in which the standard and the comparee are
conceived to be of equal degree on a given scale, are formed by using different
particles encoding meanings such as ‘be alike’, ‘like this’, ‘and so like this’, ‘be
equal’, ‘be similar to’. Choosing one particle or another depends primarily on
whether or not the speaker can physically signal the relative dimension of the
standard of comparison, and on the physical proximity of the speaker to the standard
of comparison. For example, if the speaker points to a tree in the distance as the
yardstick for comparison of height, then the particle paniʔna ‘and so like this’ (or its
shortened allomorph panʔ) would be used. This particle is also used whenever the
standard of comparison is not visually accessible. If instead the speaker physically
touches the yardstick of comparison, or uses gestures to indicate its dimensions, then
most often the particle mɨn ‘be equal’ is used.
Example (30) above, highlights the use of particles mɨn ‘be equal’, and paʔniʔ
‘be alike/be like this’. During the utterance of the first line in the example, the
speaker was indicating how short the younger brother is with a hand gesture, by
placing one hand below with the palm of the hand facing upwards, and the other
hand higher up with its palm facing downwards. In this case the speaker uses the
particle mɨn ‘be equal’. Then, the speaker pointed at Chavela (a young girl listening
to the conversation), expressing that ‘the younger brother’ in the tale was about her
size; for this comparison the speaker uses the particle paʔniʔ ‘be alike/be like this’.
Additional examples of semblative comparatison are given in (31)-(33) below.
A further description of Kakua’s particles, including the ones occurring within
comparative constructions, can be found in Chapter 3.

The superlative, describing a situation in which the comparee has the highest
degree among the standards of comparison, is expressed by using the noun niʔat
‘all/everything’, as in (34), or by using an emphasizing construction, as in (35),
where the nominalized verb jǔb ‘be true’ serves to express that the referent of the
noun keh ‘fish’ is the biggest among the referents of the standard of comparison
noun bita ‘others’. These examples additionally illustrate that the noun phrase
expressing the standard can be case-marked. Maybe this indicates that the standard
is regarded as a syntactic object. There is no explanation why it is that sometimes
comparees are object marked while other times they are not (the animacy hierarchy
governing DOM does not seem to predict object marking in these cases).

juxtaposition of two NPs without a verb. The subject argument always occurs clauseinitially in this type of clauses. Verbless clauses are used to express equative

Note that an alternative analysis of these constructions may seem to be that
the copula has been omitted, i.e. as ‘zero copula’ construction. According to the
standard definition of copula constructions (Hengeveld 1992, Pustet 2003, and
especially Stassen 1994), a ‘zero copula’ type of construction presupposes that there
is a syntactic slot that is otherwise filled by another element, or in which a copula
occurs optionally under certain grammatical criteria. The examples shown in this
subsection, however, are not considered here as copula constructions with a zero
copula, because it is not the case that in these constructions a syntactic slot remains
empty in a restricted context, while alternating with an overt copula in some other
contexts. The examples presented in this section do not have alternatives with an
overt copula.
Additionally, the simple juxtaposition of related elements in Kakua is a very
common strategy to express many different types of relations (e.g., derivation of
nouns Chapter 5, possession Chapter 5, coordination of clauses Chapter 13). It should
not be surprising then that expressing these more ‘permanent’ states of being (as
opposed to the less permanent states of being illustrated in the examples in section
§12.2) also appeal to the juxtaposition of elements as a way to express these more
permanent states of being.
12.7Basic locative constructionsA basic locative construction (or BLC), as defined in Levinson and Wilkins
(2006:15), is a type of construction that predominantly “occurs in response to a
Where-question”. There are two different options for expressing locative relations in324A Grammar of KakuaKakua. One is by means of the locative clitic =bǔ,1 the other by means of positional
verbs (of which Kakua has an extensive set). This section describes these two types
of basic locative construction. Further information on the locative marker =bǔ and
its functions is found in Chapter 6 on grammatical relations and case marking.
Chapter 8 provides more information on the semantics of positional verbs in the
context of the description of Kakua verbs.
The locative marker =bǔ serves to express a variety of locative meanings,
among them allative ‘to/into’ and ablative ‘from’. Positional verbs cover inessive
‘in’, and adessive ‘on’ locative meanings. Examples (40)-(45) below illustrate the
stative locative, and the allative and ablative locative meanings expressed by the
locative clitic =bǔ :2

Elements of the noun phrase
7.0IntroductionThis chapter describes other words from closed classes that occur in the noun
phrase. In particular this chapter deals with the description of pronouns,
demonstratives, questions words, numerals and quantifiers in Kakua, and further
additional elements of the noun phrase.
The noun phrase in Kakua is built according to the template in (1) below.
Demonstratives (DEM), lexical possessors (POSS), pronouns (PN) including
possessive and interrogative pronouns, numerals (NUM) and quantifiers (Quant) all
precede the head noun. A head noun may be a bare noun root (see Chapter 4), a
compound of noun roots (see Chapter 5), or another derived noun (e.g., a
nominalized verb stem, or a noun stem taking some derivational morphology). Any
of the elements shown in (1) below with the exception of modifiers can also function
as a noun phrase on its own. Modifiers of the head noun (adjectives or nominalized
verbs) may precede or follow the head noun (see discussion on adjectives in Chapter
3, §3.2.1).
1)NP  (Dem) (POSS/PN) (Num/Quant) (modifiers) (POSS=)N (modifiers)Each of the elements of the noun phrase shown in (1) above occurs only once
within the noun phrase. This Chapter is organized as follows. Section §7.1 provides
a description of personal pronouns. Interrogative pronouns and question words are
dealt with in Section §7.2, and the demonstrative pronouns are described in §7.3.
The description of numerals (§7.4) and quantifiers (§7.5) follows. The last section
on this chapter, §7.6, presents the emphasis marker =bǔ as another element of the
noun phrase. For the description of the coordination of noun phrases see Chapter 13.","[232, 233]"
"The noun: morphology and structure129The positions of morphemes in nouns is summarized in Table 4.1. Only the
root (in boldface) is obligatory in forming a noun word in Kakua, except in the case
of bound nouns (see §4.1). While free nouns will not require more than a noun root,
obligatorily bound nouns require additional nominal morphology, these being
proclitics, or classifiers. Some nouns can have more than one root (see §5.1 in
Chapter 5 on noun compounding and classifiers). The noun word (as a grammatical
word) ends at position 5. Nouns (as phonological words) may include clitics
(positions 6-10).

Examples in (44)-(46) below illustrate instances in which animals from all
three sets are represented. In (44) the noun referring to the jaguar in object function
is marked. Since the jaguar is lower on the animacy hierarchy than a 2 nd person
subject, this marking is optional (see §6.3.1). In (45), the noun referring to the
monkey is optionally marked, maybe because the monkey could also be the agent of
the clause in the particular context in which this example occurred, to avoid
ambiguity, or because the monkey is a relatively big animal. Finally, example (46)
features a rather small sized animal, which is unlikely to be the agent of the clause,
and thus left unmarked (note that my informant stated that it may as well be marked,
and still judged a grammatical sentence):

referents, object arguments are (facultative) optionally marked. Examples (50)-(52)
illustrate instances in which all arguments involved are animals and thus those in
object function are marked: Note that jaguar in example (50) is a mythologically
important animal, and thus higher on the animacy hierarchy than the object noun
phrase (‘dog’), so the object marker in this constellation should be optional. The
elicited example (49) above illustrates that in this constellation object marking is
indeed optional.

"202A Grammar of Kakua6.3.6 Inanimates
Marking of object case for inanimate noun phrases is optional. Whether they
are marked for object case can be predicted to some degree on the basis of their
definiteness or possibly other discourse related characteristics (i.e., marking of object
case for inanimate noun phrases occurs in some contexts but not others, and when it
does occurs, it might be required by contexts rather than based on the speaker’s
choice). However, in elicitation object case marking on inanimate noun phrases is
always judged acceptable by speakers. Thus, the overt marking of object case for
inanimate entities in object function is not ungrammatical in Kakua, but commonly
omitted. See examples (57)-(58) below where inanimate entities in object function
are marked:
57) tɨ ̃̂=diʔ
mâw-a=ka

pathway=DECL sleep-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PSTkět=hĩ3PL=REM.PSTwãptʃǐ=diʔhut=OBJ
‘in the pathway, they slept in a hut’
Compare these to examples (59)-(60) below, where the object argument is
inanimate and left unmarked. Speakers will accept either the marked or the unmarked
options of these examples:
59) wěm

hodaʔ ‘banana’, and tʃɨ ̃̂ ‘pineapple’ in example (61) are all marked. This example
comes from a conversation, and when asked, speakers agreed that these arguments
could have been left unmarked as well without affecting the interpretation of the
utterance:Argument marking and case marking 203

pineapple=OBJ 1SG=plant-FUT=DECL
‘over there, this year, when my work is finished I will plant banana, then I will
plant pineapple’
To avoid ambiguity, constructions involving the interaction between
inanimate referents in two or more argument positions require obligatory object
marking. See example (62) below. If in this example the object argument is
unmarked, it is judged ambiguous by speakers:
62) mâ-naʔ

tree-CL:tree.like
house=OBJ
3SG.M=EVID-breakhit/kill=DECL=ASS
‘the tree will probably break the house’ (if it falls onto it)
Examples like the ones in (58) and (61) above (also example (80) below) raise
an important question for future research. In these examples (and many others), the
object marker occurs with some sort of goal function (like in húptʃi=diʔ ‘year=OBJ’
in example (61), or wãptʃǐ=diʔ ‘manioc.field=OBJ’ in (58), or location function as
in Wacará=diʔ=mǔn ‘wacara=OBJ=ASSOC.PL’ in (80) below). This suggests a
possibility of describing the object case marker =diɁ ‘OBJ’ as a marker of nonsubject function, rather than strictly an object marker. See also further discussion in
§6.4.1 below regarding marking of object case in adjuncts.","[223, 224, 225]"
"6.1The expression of subject argumentsAs shown in Table 6.1 in the introduction to this chapter, subject arguments
(for both transitive and intransitive predicates) in Kakua are not marked by case;
instead, subject arguments are indexed on the verb with cross-referencing proclitics
that encode number and person values of the subject argument (and gender for 3 rd
person singular subjects). Subject marking in Kakua is thus done by head-marking
(on the verb), while other arguments are dependent-marked (by case).
Table 6.2 below gives a list of Kakua subject proclitics (see Chapter 7 for a
detailed description of Kakua’s pronominal system). The proclitic ʔã=, here glossed
as ‘3SG.M’, is used for any 3rd singular subject argument that is not feminine; that is
to say, the ʔã= proclitic is used as a “default” 3rd singular in general.

In the intransitive clause in (1), the subject argument húptʃi ‘summer’ is crossreferenced on the verb by the proclitic ʔã = ‘3SG’. In the transitive clauses in (2)
and (3) the subject argument is a free pronoun and the cross-referencing proclitic on
the predicate of the clause agrees in person and number with the subject pronoun. In
(4) and (5) the subject is not expressed by a noun phrase, but the proclitic on the

Subject indexing on the verb, however, can also be omitted under specific
semantic and discourse conditions, related to animacy, definiteness, and if the
argument can be recuperated from the discourse.
The omission of cross-referencing morphology due to semantic criteria seems
to be typologically common (c.f., Givón 1979; Lambrecht 1994, Comrie 1989, Croft
2003, Iemmolo 2011).
In Kakua, if the subject argument of a clause can be recuperated from the
discourse context, cross-referencing proclitics are not obligatory, and thus may be
omitted.
Example (6) below illustrates one such case. This example is taken from a
conversation in which the speaker producing the text was commenting on the time
when a group of Nɨkak people were brought to the Kakua village in Wacará in the
early 90’s. At the beginning of the conversation it was established that the Nɨkak
people came, as illustrated in (6):

various different activities that the Nɨkak people did while in Wacará. Note that the
first predicate in (6) is marked with the cross-referencing proclitic ʔĩ= ‘3PL’A Grammar of Kakua186(highlighted in boldface) in agreement with the subject argument nùtkãkwã1 ‘Nɨkak’.
The second predicate in (6) and the predicates in (7) below, mâw ‘kill’ and nǎwʔ
‘tell’, have the same argument nùtkãkwã ‘Nɨkak’, but they do not have the expected
cross-referencing proclitic ʔĩ= ‘3PL’. I have highlighted in boldface these predicates
which should be expected to carry the cross-referencing proclitic:

‘They killed animals (it seemed), they told of three, two (animals) they'd killed

argument can be recovered from discourse and thus cross-referencing proclitics can
be omitted. These examples come from a narrative in which the speaker starts out
by establishing that one day he went out to look for food (8); then the speaker
continues to tell the different activities that he did while looking for food. Note that
once the speaker has established who the main topic of the story is, cross-referencing
proclitics are omitted in the other verb constructions (9).

Introduction: Kakua and its speakers
1.0IntroductionKakua is an Amazonian language spoken in the linguistic area of the Vaupés,
in Northwest Amazonia, eastern Colombia (the Ethnologue/ISO 639-3 code for
Kakua is cbv; the WALS code is cac).
The language is a member of the small Kakua-Nɨkak language family.1 Its
speakers live in inland forest settlements. Two main settlements are home to most of
Kakua’s approximately 250 speakers. The largest of these two settlements is
Wacará2, with 183 individuals.3 Wacará is located between the Vaupés and the
Querarí Rivers in Colombian territory approximately 100 kilometers to the east of
Mitú, near the Brazilian border (see Map 1 below).
The second bigger Kakua settlement is Nuevo Pueblo, which is an inland
forest village between the Vaupés and the Papurí rivers. The number of inhabitants
of this village is approximately 40 ~ 45 individuals.
About 10-15 other speakers of Kakua live scattered either in villages inhabited
by speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages (a neighboring language family), or on
their own in remote interfluvial settlements.
The present work undertakes a grammatical description of the Kakua
language. The description is based mainly on dialects spoken in the Kakua village
of Wacará. Kakua is divided into two main dialect areas (see §1.6 below), in each of
these areas, there are some clan-specific varieties.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"
"5.2Noun classification and classifiers5.2.1 Amazonian nominal classification systems
Noun classes and classifiers are recognized as two separate phenomena in the
typology of nominal classification systems. Noun class systems are characterized as
systems with a small set of typically bound morphemes that are used for agreement
marking on various elements in a clause (Dixon 1986; Grinevald [Craig] 1986,
2000). Classifiers, on the other hand, are (usually free) forms that are not used as
agreement markers and that display a large set of members (cf. Allan 1977; Senft
2000, 2007; Croft 1994).
Grinevald & Seifart (2004, see also Seifart & Payne 2007, Seifart 2007,
Seifart 2010a) argue that a strict division between noun classes and classifier systems
makes it difficult to account for the properties of nominal classification systems in
Amazonian languages.
Instead, Grinevald & Seifart (2004) suggest that both defining properties
formerly given to the two separate systems (noun class vs. classifiers) converge in
one and the same system in some Amazonian languages. Seifart & Payne (2007:385)
suggest that possibly these nominal classification systems developed via
grammaticalization from nouns into both classifiers and agreement markers, given
that these systems display both agreement and boundedness.
Nominal classification in Kakua shares characteristics of Amazonian systems
identified by Seifart & Payne (2007) as typical for Northwest Amazonia, namely
properties typical of a noun class system (bound suffixes, some marginal
anaphoric/agreement functions), as well as properties typical of a classifier system
(large set of forms with derivational functions specifying shape, texture or gender).
For the sake of a consistent terminology, though recognizing that the classification
of nouns in Kakua converge defining properties of noun classes and classifiers, in
this chapter I refer to the nominal classification system in Kakua as “classifiers” and
gloss them throughout as ‘CL’.
The following sections provide a definition of classifiers in Kakua and the set
of thus identified classifiers (§5.2.2), a discussion of the derivational use of classifiers148A Grammar of Kakuaand similarities between classifier constructions and noun compounding (§5.2.3), and
the anaphoric use of classifiers (§5.2.4.)5.2.2 Kakua classifiers as a subclass of nouns
Morphosyntactically, classifiers in Kakua are a subclass of nouns. Like nouns,
they can often stand on their own (see for example (11) below). However, they are
identified here as a separate subset of nouns because, unlike regular nouns, they have
particular functions, semantic profiles, and forms that sets them apart from the rest
of nouns. These are listed below:
i)
Functions: the subclass of nouns identified as classifiers, has two
main functions:
a) Derivation (§5.2.4)
b) Anaphoric reference (§5.2.5)
ii)
Semantic profile: semantically, this subclass of nouns has a
distinctive profile, which can be divided into three groups: gender
specification (§5.2.6), shape (§5.2.7), and texture (§5.2.8).
iii)
Form: often these classifier nouns have forms that are shorter than
lexical nouns, or seem to be a reduced form of a noun or verb. In
addition, unlike the rest of the majority of nouns, some of the
classifiers appear to be toneless. 1 When not bound, the set of noun
classifiers can function either for anaphoric reference to an NP or as
a modifier of an NP.
Note that in combination with other nouns, classifiers are represented as
bound forms in the transcriptions. They are referred to as “suffixed” elements
whenever they occur attached to a preceding noun. The reason to identify them as
“attached” elements, rather than juxtaposed nouns, is that when classifiers occur
attached to a preceding noun, they form one single phonological word with that noun.
Note that a classifier can also attach to a complex noun stem, after, e.g. plural
suffixes, and not directly to the noun root.
Another motivation to call this subclass of nouns classifiers is because of their
typical use and semantics, which are overall very similar to classifier systems
described for surrounding languages in the Vaupés area and beyond.
It is difficult to draw a line between constructions involving classifiers
attached to nouns versus compounds consisting of two nouns. This point can be
particularly well illustrated with terms referring to parts of plants, where there is not
1Phonetically, the forms which appear to be toneless, adapt to the melody of the morpheme towhich they attach. For example, if they are attached to a morpheme with a falling tone, then the classifierwill be pronounced with a low tone by copying the last portion of the falling tone contour from thepreceding morpheme. When no tone precedes it (e.g., when attached to other toneless noun morphologylike plural marking, or when standing on their own), these toneless classifiers are pronounced with a lowtone.","[169, 170]"
"11.1. Word order
Kakua has a predominant preference for an (S)OV order of constituents,
where the subject NP can be omitted under certain semantic and discourse conditions
(These conditions are discussed in Chapter 6 on case marking and grammatical
relations, and include animacy and accessibility.) Additionally, subject arguments
can be indexed on the predicate by means of cross-referencing proclitics that agree
in person and number with the subject argument, and gender for 3rd person singular
subject arguments. A detailed discussion of the criteria governing the omission or
full expression of subject argument NPs and cross-referencing proclitics is given in
Chapter 6.
Whenever overtly expressed, the subject argument most frequently precedes
both the object(s) argument(s) and the verb. The verb is predominantly in final
position. The following examples illustrate this preferred SOV order of constituents.
An SV intransitive clause is illustrated in (1), an example in which the subject NP
of a transitive clause is omitted (OV) is illustrated in (2), and sentences with subject,
object, and verb are illustrated in (3)-(5):mi=ʔèh-ep=be=buh

Alternatively, other orders are also accepted. However, when these occur,
they tend to be stricter as regards the morphological encoding of arguments. An OSV
order, for example, tends to favour the overt marking of case on the object argument,
and preferably also the overt expression of the subject cross-referencing proclitic on
the predicate:
6) jegêʔ=diʔ fǐt
clothes=OBJ 1PL
‘we sewed clothes’fĩ=waj ̀=na1PL=pull=DECLThe least accepted order seems to be VSO, followed by OVS. The latter was
accepted by speakers if the information given was visually witnessed, but even in
these cases it was considered as a rather odd order. The scale from most accepted to
least accepted, or from most preferred to least preferred (and least frequent) orders
conforms to the following scale. All of these orders are attested in naturally occurring
texts and elicitation:
Figure 11.1 Acceptability scale of order of constituents in Kakuamost preferred
SOV >OSVleast preferred>OVS>SVO>VSO>VOSThe scale above shows that orders towards the least preferred end of the scale
are those in which the object argument follows the verb and the verb is not in final
position. Kakua’s preferred order, thus, can be described as basically OV.
The scale shown above is based on general impressions of both texts and
elicitation. A more accurate description of these alternate orders would require a
quantitative approach of the occurrence of each of these orders throughout the
corpus.
Clauses with adjuncts tend to place the adjunct immediately after the subject
of the clause. Other orders, however, are also found. The most common linear order
of constituents in a clause with an adjunct follows the template below:Alignment and word order307Figure 11.2 Most typical constituent order in clauses with adjuncts

Examples (7)-(9) below illustrate intransitive (7), transitive (8), and

in boldface) follows the subject NP.

Despite the preferred SOV constituent order, the object NP may also precede

discourse, resulting in an OSV order:

The alignment system in Kakua conforms to the prototypical nominativeaccusative type, whereby the intransitive subject and the most agentive argument of
a transitive clause are expressed in the same way, but different from the least
agentive argument of a transitive clause: A=S≠O. Because intransitive subjects (S)
and the most agentive arguments of transitive clauses (A) are treated equally in
Kakua, I refer to both as ‘subjects’. Subject arguments are not morphologically
marked by case. Cross-referencing proclitics attach to the verb and agree in person
and number with the subject arguments of the clause. All other arguments (i.e.,
arguments functioning in any role different from subject) are morphologically
marked for case, if the requirements for differential object marking are met (see
Chapter 6). Alignment of object arguments is neutral, meaning that object arguments308A Grammar of Kakuain the semantic roles of patients, themes, and recipients are all encoded in the same
way: P=T=R (see Chapter 6).
The morphological marking of arguments in Kakua shows both head and
dependent marking (in terms of Nichols 1986). While subject arguments are headmarked (morphologically indexed on the predicate), object arguments are dependentmarked by morphological case markers on the object NPs.
The remainder of this chapter is divided into two parts. Section §11.3 focuses
specifically on the alignment of subjects, while section §11.4 describes the alignment
of objects. A summary is given in §11.5, listing the most relevant information
regarding alignment in Kakua.","[326, 327, 328, 329]"

Once a verb has been nominalized, it can take prototypical noun morphology

the nominalized verb is part of a compound. Note also that the nominalization jâpat (pass-NMLZ) ‘tip’ is not semantically transparent.

Agentive nominalization is achieved by adding the suffix -ni to a verb stem.
The resulting noun refers to an (animate) entity that can be characterized as a
frequent doer of an action, i.e., ‘one who VERBs’.
Note that the suffix -ni has a number of other functions. Besides deriving
agentive nouns from verbs, it can also derive adjectives from descriptive verbs, as
illustrated further below. Examples (56)-(59) below illustrate the derivation of
agentive nouns from verbs in Kakua:140A Grammar of Kakua56) hîguʔ-‘to appear/ reveal/ show up’

and further illustrated in Chapter 8):

‘the day you are well (good)’jêwháp=diʔ

Another way of forming instrument nominalizations in Kakua is by attaching
a noun classifier to a verb stem. This strategy emphasizes the shape of the referent
of the derived noun, often encoding a meaning of ‘an instrument for VERBING’.
Examples (61)-(62) illustrate the verb-classifier nominalization strategy in
Kakua:
61) haȟ
‘slide.on.water’
haȟ -tʃû
‘boat’ (lit. the cover thing for sliding on water)
slide.on.water-CL:cover
62) tʃaǩtʃaǩ -daʔbite-CL:round‘bite’
‘axe’ (lit. the round thing for biting)While classifiers can act as nominalizers on their own, attaching a classifier
is far more common with verb stems that have already been nominalized with the
nominalizer suffix -at, as illustrated in examples (63)-(67) below:The noun: morphology and structure14163) têw-at-daʔ
play-NMLZ-CL:round
‘ball’ (lit. round one for playing)
64) hěmʔ-at-daʔ

‘lantern’
66) a. dǎk-at-dubʔ
write-NMLZ-CL:pointed
‘pencil’b. dǎk-at-tuliwrite-NMLZ-CL:layers
‘book’It is important to note that classifiers in Kakua are almost exclusively used
with nouns or verbs that are nominalized (through the nominalization process of
adding the nominalizer suffix -at or the agent nominalizer -ni). Exceptions to this
were shown in examples (61)-(62) above (which do not require the nominalizer
suffix -at). A case related to this is given in example, (67), where a noun is derived
from a verb by the addition of nɨw ‘leaf’, which is a noun in Kakua, but resembles
classifiers in its semantics as well as its use as nominalizer in this example.
67) a. dâdaʔ-nɨw
to.reflect-leaf
‘photo’b. dâdaʔ-nɨwʔɨbʔ-at-daʔto.reflect-leaf
take.out-NMLZ-CL:round
‘photo camera’It would be also possible to analyze nɨw ‘leaf’ in the example above as a
classifier instead of as a noun. This is consistent with other languages of the area,
where ‘leaf’ is commonly expressed with a classifier, and has developed extended
meanings of, e.g., ‘paper’, ‘book’. In Kakua, ‘leaf’ has extended also to mean ‘paper’,
though usually the Spanish borrowing papelaɁ is used.
Analyzing ‘leaf’ as a noun contrasts with v-classifier type of nominalization
(without additional nominalizing morphology) that has been described as a typical
nominalization strategy in many Eastern Tukanoan languages (neighboring groups
of Kakua), like the following examples from Wanano (68) and Desano (69):142A Grammar of KakuaWanano: (Stenzel 2004):
68) hoa-dʉ

Desano: (Silva 2012):
69) baya-wi
dance-CL:house
‘a house of dance’
4.3.4 The v-v nominalization
Finally, the least productive type of nominalization in Kakua is v-v verb
compounding. Being non-productive, these units are presumably perceived as fixed
units by speakers, more like a lexical nouns, rather than a combination of verbs, also
because the resulting meaning is often not transparently related to the meaning of
the contained verb stems. An example of this type of lexical nouns from v-v
compounding is given in (70) below, and only a few more of these are found
throughout the corpus of Kakua grammar: 5
70) kâmaʔ-ʔǎb
be.cold-go.up
‘shadow’5Another form that speakers also indicated as an alternate meaning for shadow is dâdaʔ-atto.reflect-NMLZ. However, most accepted the one in (70) as a more accurate translation of shadow.","[160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"
"10.6.3 Second-hand evidentiality
The categories of visual (unmarked) and nonvisual, described above, can be
described as firsthand evidential categories. Additionally, Kakua has two other
categories which indicate that the proposition was not directly experienced by the
speaker. These two categories of ‘second-hand’ evidence express inferences and
reported evidence. Each of these has specific morphemes, =ta (with its allomorph
=tagǎ) and =dê for inference (§10.6.4 below), and =wɨt for reported evidentiality
(§10.6.5 below). These two second-hand categories may co-occur with a prefix,
which indicates inferential evidentiality in general, without specifying whether or
not this inference is based on some else’s report or not, and which can be used on
its own. The co-occurrence of the second hand prefixes and reported or inferred
envidentiality clitics is not obligatory.
This prefix has three allomorphs: t- ~ ti-, and t- ~ ta- and are all glossed as
‘EVID’. The forms t- ~ ti- co-occur with the reported evidential clitic =wɨt, and the
forms t- ~ ta- co-occur with the inferred evidential clitics =ta, =tagǎ. Both prefixing
forms ti- and ta- typically undergo a phonological reduction to t-. It is possible that
in a future stage of the language the difference between the two forms ti- and ta- will
be lost, and only the form t- will survive to encode second-hand evidentiality, where
further specification for inference or reportative will be required (as it is in
synchronic Kakua). Moreover, the difference between ti- and ta- is only rarely made
by elder speakers, and younger speakers only use the prefixed form t- for both
inference and reportative evidentiality. Thus, because of this possible future path
towards a neutralization of the prefixed forms into one single ‘second-hand’
evidentiality marker in need of further specification, I propose that these are
synchronically different markers, but will at some point merge together into one.
Even for the elder generation that still makes the difference between ti- and
ta-, the difference seem to be made exclusively when a clitic of inference or
reportative is not present. In the remaining cases when the clitics for inference or
reportative are marked, then the prefixing forms ti- or ta- seem to be more rarely
marked fully as such, and are rather found as t-.
A few examples are shown below. More examples of the co-occurrence of
the second-hand prefix with clitics of inference or reported evidentiality can be found
below in §10.6.4 and §10.6.5 respectively.",[319]
"3.2.1 Nouns
In Kakua, nouns are typically formed by a noun root which serves as the head
of the phrase (a detailed description of subclasses of nouns is given in Chapter 4).
Semantically, prototypical Kakua nouns are lexical items denoting things,
places, names, animate and inanimate entities, abstract concepts such as thoughts and104A Grammar of Kakuafeelings, and various ecological elements. This semantic characterization of the noun
class complies with the typical typological characteristics of nouns (c.f. Givón 1979,
Hopper & Thompson 1984, Thompson 1988, Schachter & Shopen 2007, among
others). Examples of Kakua nouns are given in (19)-(20):
19) nin tɨtʃi,

‘In this village, here in Wacará’

1SG
one-CL:fem=EMPH
‘I, alone, planted manioc’tul̂ iʔtɨ=diʔmanioc=OBJwã=tah-ap1SG=plant-PSTSyntactically, nouns head noun phrases which can function as arguments of a
predicate; thus, nouns are typical hosts for the marking of case to indicate the
grammatical function of a head noun within a clause (see Chapter 6).
Kakua is a predominantly verb-final language, thus, noun phrases tend to
precede the verb as illustrated in example in (21) below:
Noun phrasesVerb21) bɨ, nin

wěm tul̂ iʔ-tɨ
wã=tah-ap=hĩ

‘Now, in this year I have planted manioc indeed’
There is no exclusive phonological trait that distinguishes nouns from other
types of morphemes in Kakua.
The morphology of nouns is far less complex than that of verbs.
Morphologically, and unlike verbs (see §3.2.2 below and Chapter 8 for the
description of the verb morphology and structure) 1, the vast majority of nouns roots
can occur on their own as free morphemes. Examples (22) and (23) below illustrate
nouns occurring as free morphemesː

"Types of morphemes and word classes111Personal pronouns are specified by number (singular and plural), and person
(first, second or third person). Gender distinction in Kakua is specified only for third
person singular.
The Kakua pronouns are summarized in Table 3.5 and discussed in detail in
Chapter 7.

fusion with the possessor marker to create possessive pronouns which are also

are no free possessive pronouns such as English ‘his, their, my’. The free forms of
personal pronouns cannot be possessed, i.e. they cannot take the possessor suffix –

"Elements of the noun phrase223The motivation for proposing a source relating to a meaning of ‘be.together’
plus an additional morphological element, relies on two facts: i) many Eastern
Tukanoan languages have a clear etymological source for the numeral ‘four’ with a
meaning similar to ‘having a companion’ (see Huber & Reed 1992 for Eastern
Tukanoan languages Tatuyo, Barasano, Tuyuka, Yurutí, Makuna, Piratapuyo,
Siriano, Karapano). Thus, extrapolating this logic to the Kakua term for ‘three’, it
could be translated into ‘that who does not have a companion’. ii) This directs the
hypothesis of thinking that possibly the form was constructed from a, previously,
complex compound involving the negative existential morpheme wîʔi-kan ‘not.existNEG’, or the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ which was attached to the verb péh meaning
‘be.together’, or ‘be friends’. Example (37) below was found in a Kakua text, in this
case, not referring to the numeral three in itself, but to an odd numbered item. Here
the speaker was counting pairs of seeds, when one seed was standing by itself in the
line of paired seeds:

‘one seed was odd (didn’t have a partner)’
Forms for numerals 6-20 are based on terms for hands, feet, fingers and toes,
added to the terms for numerals one, two, and three. These are shown in Table 7.6
below.
Note that in the glosses given for these lexemes, sometimes the plural
morpheme given is the animate plural -wã (e.g., ʧênewã ‘two’) or the inanimate
plural -na (e.g., ʧênna ‘two’, ʧênenamîk ‘four’). The use of either plural animate or
plural inanimate is determined by the animacy of the enumerated noun: if it is
inanimate (ʧênna mɨ ̃̌ ‘two houses’) the plural form used in the numerals is the
inanimate plural -na ‘IN.PL’. If it is animate (ʧênwã kãk ‘two persons’) the plural
form used in the numeral is the animate plural suffix -wã.

‘with two hands and two feet like this’As seen in the forms given in Tables 7.5 and 7.6 above, Kakua does not have
any special morphology for higher numerals. Instead, compounds of verb or noun
roots, and other additional morphology not specific to numerals or quantifiers are
used form these.
Although Kakua speakers have reported that this numeral system can be
extended to numbers higher than 20, by adding terms of body parts of other
individuals (‘two hands and two feet and one hand from another person’), in actual
practice any quantity beyond five is expressed by using Spanish loans, as in (38) and
(39):

‘you take him out first, I’m going to make a prayer on him’Numerals in Kakua are often accompanied by a hand gesture. When
expressing the numerals one and two, the speaker will join together her index finger
and middle finger as in picture 1 below. Note that this gesture does not differentiate
between the numerals one and two. Even though one would expect the use of one
finger for one, and the gesture in picture 1 for number two only, the gesture in Picture
1 is in fact used for both numbers.","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250]"
"128A Grammar of KakuaBound noun stems are almost all obligatorily possessed. These include, but
are not restricted to, nouns with human referents, like kinship terms, but also nouns
denoting body parts, parts of a bigger entity, hunting and personal instruments. Also
included in this group of obligatorily bound noun stems are a large number of nouns
referring to inanimate entities which must be specified by a shape classifier suffix.
The nature of these nouns is further described in Chapter 5 (on compounding,
classification, and possession of nouns in Kakua), which also includes a discussion
on the status of classifiers. Bound nouns thus require a possessive pro-form
preceding the obligatorily bound noun (see Chapter 5 for a description of possession
in Kakua, obligatoriness and the alienable/inalienable distinctions).
Kinship terms in Kakua, for example, are obligatorily possessed.
Furthermore, they are possessed via a strategy of inalienable possession in which
they take a proclitic pronoun, and not possessive pronouns (see Section §7.1 in
Chapter 7 for a description of pronominal forms in Kakua):
1)a. wã=ipb.Ɂĩ=hî
c.
3PL=son.in.law
‘their son in law’mi=nɨm
3SG.F=daughter
‘her daughter’2)a. *ipb.*hî*nɨm1SG=father
‘my father’fatherson.in.lawc.daughterNouns that can occur as free forms without need of additional morphology
include proper names, nouns referring to animals, vocative forms of kinship terms,
elements referring to parts of the natural environment (e.g., dirt, star, sun, dawn),
and some objects that do not need to be specified by shape classifiers.
3)a. bɨ ̌bʔ4.2Noun template‘louse’b.ʔîm‘lake’c.Ɂetá‘grandmother.VOC’Nominal morphology in Kakua is by far less complex than verbal
morphology. Kakua nouns never take prefixes. With the exception of proclitics
(including possessive proclitics which obligatorily precede bound nouns), the
morphology of nouns in Kakua is exclusively post-stem, and this includes suffixes
and enclitics.
Free noun roots can stand on their own as the only obligatory element to form
a noun word in Kakua, unlike verbs (see §3.1.1 and Chapter 8 for verb morphology).
Free nouns roots can also function as arguments of a predicate or as an attributive
modifier of another noun.
Of all of Kakua’s word classes, only nouns can be specified for possession.
Nominal negation is expressed through existential negation constructions (see
Chapter 12, §12.7 for a description on existential negation constructions).","[149, 150]"
"236A Grammar of KakuaPhonologically, the characteristics of verb roots are not unique to the class of
verbs (see the description of the defining characteristics of the different parts of
speech in Chapter 3). Verb roots, as roots in the language as a whole, must be
minimally monosyllabic, and maximally bisyllabic. Roots bear lexical tone, and all
of Kakua’s tonal inventory is exhibited in verb roots (as shown in 1 below):
1) jùjjûj
jǔj‘have diarrea’
‘massage while praying’
‘be dripping’Although a verb word may be composed of several roots (see Chapter 9 for verb
compounding and serialization), and these roots may present different tonal values,
the verb word as a whole has a characteristic intonation, with a high pitch at the
beginning of the word that gradually falls towards the end of the word. Thus, if a
verb word is composed of more than one root, the highest tone pitch for the second
root is invariably lower than the highest tone pitch of the first root (this is discussed
in detail in Chapter 2 on Kakua phonology regarding downdrift).
Verb roots are also lexically specified for nasality or orality, as another general
characteristic of Kakua roots that is not unique to verb roots. As briefly introduced
in Chapter 2, verbs are distinguished from nouns primarily on semantic and
morphosyntactic grounds, rather than phonological (see the overview in Chapter 2
on the parts of speech and their basic characteristics).
Semantically, verbs roots refer to actions (e.g., ʧaǩ̃ ‘bite’), processes (e.g.,
mǒp ‘to rot’), and temporal or permanent states (e.g., paʔ ‘be.like’; hěp ‘be.jealous’).
In other words, Kakua verbs prototypically express relations that are anchored in
time, processes or actions, or more general atemporal states of being such as dɨ ̀ ‘be
red’, nɨmʔ ‘be below’, etc. States denoting inherent or temporal properties are usually
expressed by descriptive verbs. The verb word may function as the predicate of the
clause.
Related to its characteristic of being a heavily agglutinative language, Kakua
verb roots tend to encode only one relatively simple meaning each, while complex
meanings are created by combining various verb roots (see discussion in §8.3 below
for each of these verbal morphemes).
Syntactically, the predicate tends to be the last constituent of the clause
(SOV). It is, thus, easy to recognize the verb word within a clause: it is the
morphologically most complex word, and the one that normally occurs in the last
syntactic position of the clause. The verb word by itself can also be sufficient both
as the predicate and as the only constituent of the clause, as is further discussed in
Chapter 11 on clause structure. Two examples are given in (2) and (3) below.
Example (2) illustrates the predicate occurring in its most typical final position.
Example (3) illustrates the predicate as sufficient to function as a clause in itself:The verb: morphology and structure

section will first address the semantics of verbs with regard to transitivity; after these
transitivity distinctions have been addressed, this section will describe the different
types of verbs with regard to other semantic features, specifically the semantic
subclasses of verbs, such as descriptive, stative, positional, and motion verbs. Other
verbal constructions and their semantics, such as verb serialization and
compounding, are dealt with in Chapter 9.
With regard to transitivity, verb roots can be identified as being inherently
intransitive or transitive (mono- or ditransitive) verbs, judging by the number of
arguments that they can take. This distinction, however, is not very straightforward
and the lexical transitivity of verb roots is often difficult to establish. This is because
arguments do not have to be overtly expressed whenever these arguments have been
previously mentioned in the discourse. This applies particularly to the overt
expression of object arguments. Subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb,
and only with restricted exceptions these are not overtly expressed. The rules
governing the optionality of cross-referencing subject proclitics are discussed in
Chapter 6.
Example (4) below illustrates this problematic classification of verbs roots
according to their lexical valency. The example is extracted from a conversation in
Kakua, shows a semantically transitive verb bɨ ́dʔ-tû ‘add.onto-hold.vertically’, where
the object argument is not expressed. However, since the argument to which the verb
is referring had been previously stated, the sentence is perfectly grammatical in
Kakua discourse:
4) bɨ ́dʔ-tû=ka=nit
add.onto-hold.vertically=ASS=S.Sʔã=t-hɨjbi-ɲɨʔ-ɨp=wɨt=hĩ3SG.M=EVID-arrive.here-stop-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
‘he arrived and stopped, and held (the panflute) vertically (against his body)’238A Grammar of KakuaThe use of another semantically transitive verb with and without an overt
object noun phrase is illustrated in (5)-(6).

‘Te went to bathe (it is said)’
3SG.F=OBJ 3PL=EVID-bathe-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
‘they bathed her (it is said)’Example (7) illustrates the semantically ditransitive verb hɨ ̂t ‘show’. With this
verb also, not all arguments need to be overtly expressed. Here, only two overt
arguments occur: the proclitic for 3SG.M ʔã= referring to the subject argument of
the clause, and the object kǎn=diʔ referring to the indirect object (recipient)
‘shaman’. The direct object (theme), tɨb ‘pain’, is dropped since it had been
previously established in the discourse:
7)kǎn=diʔhɨ ̂dɁɨ=kaʔã=t-beh=tagǎ3SG.M=OBJ
show=ASS
3SG.M= EVID-go=INF.EVID
‘perhaps he went to show (his pain) to him (the shaman)’As discussed in Chapter 8, Kakua does not mark subject arguments with
morphological case, but rather they are indexed on the verb. Other arguments
(objects), receive the case marker =diʔ ‘OBJ’. The marking of case for object
arguments, however, is governed by differential object marking rules (c.f., §8.3), and
thus, some arguments that function as objects may lack case markers. Therefore, the
presence or absence of object case markers on arguments is not a reliable indicator
of the transitivity of the root. Example (8) illustrates the verb ‘eat’ hěmʔ, where the
object argument is not morphologically marked for case, which is one of the formal
cues that help identify the valency of verb roots, here camouflaged by the absence
of such marker on the object argument:
8)Katerinetʃɨ ̂Katherine pineapple
‘Katherine eats pineapple’mi=hěmʔ=na=ka3SG.F=eat=DECL=ASSAs seen in the examples above, defining transitivity values of Kakua verbs is
complicated by the omission of arguments, on the one hand, and optionality of case
marking, on the other hand. Intransitive verbs can thus be identified as those that can
maximally take one (subject) argument, and no object arguments, while mono- and
ditransitive verbs can be identified as those that can take one or two object
arguments, keeping in mind that these do not need to be overtly expressed, and if
they are, they do not need to be marked for object case. Given the possible omissionThe verb: morphology and structure239of object arguments, mono- and ditransitive verbs can also be called ambitransitives,
i.e. verbs that may behave both like intransitive and transitive verbs.","[257, 258, 259, 260, 261]"
"7.5QuantifiersIn addition to numerals, Kakua has other morphemes that express quantity.
These are: tâwʔ ‘sometimes’, tak ‘be.middle/half’, niʔat ‘all/every’, lâ ‘times/era’,
dawǎ ‘many’, and henaʔ ‘this much/count/measure’. These terms can act like
modifiers of nouns (or adverbials) in noun phrases, or can also occur by themselves
as the head of a noun phrase functioning as quantifiers. Examples of these
morphemes expressing quantity are given below:

locative case marking):

particular participant in an event. A contrast between the locative use of this marker
and its emphatic use can be seen by comparing (54) and (55) above to the example
in (56) below.

The two meanings of this form are undoubtedly related and probably
historically derive from one morpheme; i.e. =bǔ underwent, or is undergoing, a
semantic extension, and also developed different distributions: one occurs with
subjects whereas the other (locative) cannot. The direction of this semantic extension
(or semantic shift) would probably have been from physical location which became
associated, over time, with the ‘location’ of a participant within the discourse,
following the cross-linguistically the common pathway from a concrete spatial
meaning to other more abstract meanings (e.g., of time or discourse relevance).
Whichever the direction might be, the semantic extension, or shift, of =bǔ
developed with a functional motivation, in which either a physical location became
