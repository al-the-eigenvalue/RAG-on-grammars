4. Constituent orderCAY morphologically handles within a single word those various syntactical
relationships for which many other (less synthetic) languages employ a number
of separate words. While the internal constituent order of suffixes is very much
restricted, word order in sentences is rather flexible, largely in correlation with
the double-marking system of the language (§ 4.1.4.2) for both:
    i) a predicate verb (subject and object number) and its core argument NPs
(case and number)  for the clause level
180 Syntactical preliminaries   ii) a head NP (third person/number) and its attributive NP (number)  for the
phrase level.
   In the following example:(73)      Elitnauriste-mA       assik-ai          mikelngu-u-tP
          teacher-REL.sg.       like-IND.3sg.3pl. child-EV-ABS.pl.
          The teacher likes the children. where the syntactic relationship among the verb and two argument NPs is
unambiguous, because of their inflections with double marking, univocally
showing that the subject is the teacher (singular) and the object is the chil-
dren (plural), and implying that any one of the six possible orders for the three
items involved have no substantial difference, even though the order above is
likely to occur more commonly than others (§ 5.4.1).
    By the same token, at the phrase (attributive):(74)      elitnauriste-mG       mikelngu-i        the teachers children.
          teacher-REL.sg.       child-ABS.3sg.pl. where the relation between the possessor and the possessum is marked in the
two NPs, hence the reversed order of mikelngui elitnauristem bringing about no
difference, though the NP in G function is likely to come first.
    Less constrained order is also the case with other nominal phrases than at-
tributive  appositive, coordinate (apart from the conjunctive enclitic),
adjunctional  except for the strongly bound juxtaposed phrases (§ 5.1.2-3,
§ 14.3.3 [numerals], § 16.3).
    Subordinate or cosubordinate clauses do not show any discrepancy from
main clauses in terms of constituent order.
    Little evidence exists that the heaviness of an argument NP or a predicate
may affect the word order.
    However, word order either within clauses or nominal phrases may be prag-
matically conditioned  see e.g. § 5.4.4.
    No particular quantifier or numeral floating is relevant to CAY.
    An enclitic and an enclitic-like particle generally follows the clause-initial
word (i.e. second-position enclitic), except for the coordinate |=Ѥu| and.
    See § 15.2 and § 35.2.4 for the position of interrogative words.","[231, 232]"
"
4.1. Some tendenciesIf, as in the following example, both the subject and the object NP
(elitnauriste-t and mikelngu-u-t) are in the same number (plural), there is no
formal cue to indicate whether either NP is the subject or object, since the
                                                                  Constituent order    181absolutive and the relative case have no distinction for non-singular unpos-
sessed nominals (Table 20; § 21). In such a case, the word order comes into
play  (a) is most naturally taken to have the teachers as the subject, and (b)
the children as the subject, suggesting a tendency towards A P V (or S O V):(75) a. Elitnauriste-tA        mikelngu-u-tP   assik-ait
        teacher-REL.pl.       child-EV-ABS.pl. like-IND.3pl.3pl.
        The teachers like the children.
     b. Mikelngu-u-tA          elitnauriste-tP assik-ait
        child-EV-ABS.pl.      teacher-REL.pl. like-IND.3pl.3pl.
        The children like the teachers. although P NP may be encountered to stand before A-NP, both in the same
number  see e.g. § 49 (26).
   The verb may also come sentence-initially as below:(76)       Apt-ait                  mikelgu-u-tA                  angute-tP.
           ask-IND.3pl.3pl.         child-EV-REL.pl.              man-ABS.pl. which is commonly understood again to mean the children asked the men,
that is, with the same tendency to place the subject before the object, although
the reverse reading (the men asked the children) may also be possible. Thus it
would not seem easy to decide the canonical or dominant word order of CAY
sentences in terms of the subject, object, and verb, 12 although the language does
show a measurable preference for APS (or SOV) as the unmarked order.
    However, the word order may be largely conditioned by discourse/pragmatic
factors instead of syntactic function. An NP in a syntactic case, absolutive and
relative, that works as a discourse topic typically comes at the sentence-initial
position, with a peripheral or demoted argument (in an oblique case) placed
towards the sentence final. See § 5.4.3 for fronting of a peripheral or an oblique
NP that works as a sentence topic.
    This is also the case for ditransitive verbs as in the following pair, (a) transi-
tive and (b) intransitive:12. The possibility of finding keys to the matter of basic word ordering may be partly
    excluded in CAY by the very fact that the language does not employ stem com-
    pounding or noun incorporation as a morphological process, and that its dependent-
    mood (connective) verbs do not seem to reveal a pronounced tendency toward a
    certain type of ordering (unlike some languages whose subordinate clauses can re-
    flect unmarked word ordering as the clause tends to be used merely to describe a
    fact or to set the scene for the main clause, and is less liable than the latter to word
    order variability in terms of, say, topicalization).

"
5.   There is another kind of noun, that is, a teknonymy (which is morphologically a
     phrasal compound from an original Xs woman), which has no distinction be-
     tween the absolutive and the relative case (both ending in -an), as opposed to a
     male teknonymy (bound phrase from Xs father) with reduced distinction be-
     tween the absolutive -(i)i and the relative -(i)in (the former may occur for S/P
     functions)  § 2.4-v, vi, § 4.3-v, § 11.6.2.
6.   T. Nagai (2006: 256) compared the number of 100 verb stems (agentive and
     patientive bivalent as well as monovalent) in CAY, North Alaskan Iñupiaq (Upper
     Kobuk), Japanese and English, giving the ratio of agentive vs. patientive in that
     language order: 56/35, 58/42, 63/26, 81/16.
96 Morphological preliminaries1.4.2. Double markingAt the clause level, an absolutive-case NP agrees with the intransitive subject or
the transitive object, and a relative-case NP with the transitive subject, as inflec-
tionally marked. At the phrase level, a relative-case NP is the dependent of an
attributive (genitive) phrase (§ 16.4), agreeing with the third-person possessor
of its head NP (possessum). Thus, both the head and the dependent show dou-
ble marking at both the clause and the phase level.
    Correlated with this double-marking of the basic grammatical relationships,
the constituent order (word order) in clauses and nominal phrases does not play
a central role in the syntax of CAY but is generally very flexible (§ 5.4), and
detached articulation (§ 2.3.3) may be far from a rarity.
    The double marking also permits a very high frequency of sentences consist-
ing of only a single (predicate) verb, as a head, with the core argument coded
only in its inflection, thereby yielding practically no ambiguity. By the same
token, attributive constructions may often consist only of the head for the
possessum, with no external NP in G function but with the person (possessor)
marked in the head NP.
    CAY belongs to the type of languages where a heavier grammatical weight
is placed on VP than NP(s), though both are intimately correlated.","[147, 148]"

    In the following example also, (a) typically occurs without the agent NP

         Where shall I find that man who is tall?    Despite the relatively low functional load of word order, there are certain
constructions that may tend to, or even have to, occur in certain more or less
fixed orders. This includes rigid order of juxtaposed-phrasal numerals
(§ 14.3.3), interrogative words that typically occur in the sentence-initial posi-
tion (though also in the second position; § 48.2.3), the pro-word |+pi-| in peri-
phrastic constructions  optative verbs (§ 49.4.2), complex verbs (§ 40.6.1) 
after the other, i.e. cosubordinate word, and so on.

dering.","[234, 235]"
"
3.3. Detached or hetero-articulationsTwo or more free words may form a syntactic phrase (or a clause), leading to
the issue of constituent (or word) order. Even though grammatically or semanti-
cally related words in languages tend to occur adjacent to each other, we very
often come across instances in which a single phrase of two (or more) words is
split by another syntactically remote word, that is to say, de-articulated. In
CAY where word order is largely free, nominal phrases (e.g. appositive;
§ 16.1), which are typically articulated as bound phrases, as well as relative or
nominal clauses (§ 17, § 18) are easily split by another syntactically remote
word, as in (13), (14), § 20(115), and even word order crossing of two nominal
phrases may occur (§ 27 [115]). Splitting or de-articulation may occur also with
(clitic- or non-clitic) bound phrases. 1716. Chinese was a polysynthetic language for Vladimir Skaliþka (19091991) who
    talked of polysynthesis in reference to compounding (incl. noun incorporation; fn.
    4)  1951 Typ polysyntKHWLFN\  7\S þHãWLQ\ Slovanké nakladatelství, Praha (ac-
    cording to Chino Eiichi). Its so-called compounds, however, may perhaps be con-
    sidered as more or less weakly bound phrases that are easily transferable to
    phrases. The more remarkable case of this may be represented by the ionization
    (so called since the 1930s) in which compounds (bisyllabic and most frequently
    verb + object nominal combinations) in the language are frequently subject to this
    form of disjunction or detachment, causing the two words to fill the predicate and
    the nominal argument slots of a clause. Cf. Chao 1968: 159160, 426434, etc.,
    e.g. ✗曮 (earth-quake) vs. ✗ṭ ᷧ㬈 曮 (earth-ASP one-time quake) there was an
    earthquake one time, although the degrees of separation and insertability do pos-
    sibly vary. By contrast, the Japanese ✗曮 [jisin] is a fixed compound and can never
    separate. A more striking instance than this is one provided by Chao (1968, 433),
    ⹤滀 \ǀXPz humour(ous), a phonetic transliteration (!), which may occur in ẽ ⽯
    ⹤滀 (he very humor) he is very humorous vs. ㇸ ⹤ ẽ ᷧ滀 (I hu- him one-mor) l
    made a joke with (humored) him.
17. Though a typologically rare feature, Cysouw (2005) offers an extensive survey of
    pre-posed enclitics in the wrong place, an example of which is also attested in
30 A word in Yupik    All these aberrant detached or hetero-articulations could hardly be under-
stood unless the word is merely a form that is not directly or strongly con-
strained by content (grammatical and semantic). Even though cases such as pre-
posed enclitics may seem unstable, reversal to a functionally explainable order
for them, would not be so easily predicted (if not impossible; cf. Haspelmath
1996: 55). Morphology should be seen to have its own motives largely inde-
pendent of the content or the function. If the function is a controlling factor,
pre-posing itself would hardly be expected to have come about in the beginning.","[81, 82]"
"
4.2. Detached constructionsAlthough items belonging to a constituent show a strong tendency to be adja-
cent, discontinuation or detached articulation (§ 2.3.3) is far from rare, correlat-
ed with a low rigidness in word order that is largely supported by double mark-
ing.
    NPs constituting a nominal phrase (§ 16) or a relative clause, for instance,
are typically contiguous, but they easily can be interrupted by another word,
say, a predicative as in the example § 17(36). See also § 27(115) for a particu-
larly interesting instance of word order crossing across two nominal phrases,
schematically, of {A B}{C D} into {A C B D}.",[235]
"    Nominal phrase embedding often results in a detached articulation (§ 2.3.3),
as amply illustrated below. See § 27 (115) also for an interesting case of word
order crossing between two nominal phrases as a special type of detached arti-
culation.
    A CAY relative clause with its (external) head noun (§ 17.1.1) consists of an
appositive phrase (with external head) with or without an attributive phrase
(with external subject), while a comparative phrase (verbalization of which is a
comparative clause; § 45.4) consists of an appositive phrase (with comparee)
and an attributive (with standard of comparison), and a complement clause con-
sists an attributive phrase (with its logical subject; § 18.1), that is, forming a
possessive construction.
    A nominal phrase as a whole cannot be subject to morphological derivation
in CAY. As far as appositive and coordinate phrases are concerned, however,
they may have one constituent (typically a common noun) expanded by a nomi-
nal-elaborating suffix NN |-lћ-| one having as in example (74) below, or ver-
balizing suffixes NV |-ƾT[̙-| / |+WDƾT[̙-| to have, there be, |-ƾ Ѡ-| to get, |+tuћլ-|
to eat, |-li-| to make), with the other constituent being stranded (or left
behind) to the ablative-modalis status (§ 25.2.2).
    The case marking of a nominal phrase as a whole is naturally determined by
its function within a clause, where it fills a syntactic slot.
    CAY has neither verbal phrases (phrasal verbs), verbal complexes (§ 2.3.2),
nor serial verbs in other languages.",[515]
"    Derivation and inflection cover a wide range of grammatical and seman-
tic/pragmatic functions. In CAY the distinction between inflection and deriva-
tion is clear-cut (though with very slight blurring)  the final -qa in (a) and -aqa
in (b) are inflections.
    Inflection, as an obligatory constituent for inflecting words, is paradigmatic,
while the derivation of optional constituents is syntagmatic. The inflection
completes a word morphologically, i.e. as a minimal form or articulus. The der-
ivation that optionally occurs between a stem and an inflection is both lexical
and grammatical, though the demarcation is not so clear. This takes the place of
many syntactic, i.e. word-external, operations made in other languages, includ-
ing relative clauses and nominalizations (§ 17 and § 18), etc.    i) Morphological homogenity: Most of the important grammatical strategies
in CAY (or any Eskimo language for that matter) rely very much upon the mor-
phological process of suffixation to the almost complete exclusion of other pro-
cesses, a remarkable contrast with many languages in the world that use two or
more mixtures of morphological processes side by side. Other processes than
suffixation are very much limited, only including, to a very small extent, redu-
plication, suppletion, and a few other anomalies, some of which may be argua-
ble (§ 4.3).
    Stem compounding (either N+V, V+N, N+N, or V+V) is entirely alien to the
language, apart from a few kinds of phrasal compounds (§ 4.3-v) which are
single words. As a corollary, the language is completely free of incorporation as
a morphological process (as a kind of N+V or V+N type compounding) of the
Sapir-Mithun tradition (§ 2.1-i), which is an important process in many so-
called polysynthetic languages (including Ainu and Chukchi-Koryak languages
in northeastern Asia and numerous Native American languages). Suffixation is
thus fully or resourcefully exploited by the language, producing incomparably
intricate words rich in functional diversity.    ii) Pure and simple suffixes: Many derivational suffixes appear to be lexical
with a concreteness of content that would characterize stems or roots in many
other languages. They are highly productive in creating new lexical items.
    However, CAY suffixes are clearly distinct from the so-called lexical or
nominal suffixes of the controversial Mosan languages (Sapir 1929)  Sa-
lish, Wakashan, and Chimakuan  in the Northwest Coast, which are commonly
counted as polysynthetic. They too may express content such as he is hunting
                                                           General characteristics    87rabbits in a single word with the same constituent order of stem-derivation-
inflection. But the fundamental difference between GCAY and those languages
may be illustrated with a regular process of forming words schematically, to
follow Matthews (1997: 173), along the lines of:           GCAY:            rabbit-hunt-IND.3sg.        vs.
           Mosan:           hunt-rabbit-PRG.3sg.with the nominal element rabbit (underlined) is the stem in GCAY but is the
derivational suffix in Mosan where it is literally a nominal suffix. The verb
to hunt is a derivational suffix in the former, but is a stem in the latter. Despite
the difference, the words in either languages are far from a fixed or ready-made
unit established prior to a speaker and stored as a single concept (§ 2.2).
    While most derivational suffixes are highly lexical or concrete in terms of
content, some of the stem-elaborating suffixes (§ 4.2.5.1) may merely add an
associative elaboration or slight modification on the content of the stem, and
what is added may not be clearly differentiated and thus hard to conceptualize.
Rather than distinctly modifying or subcategorizing what is denoted by the
stem, those suffixes may have a general, diffuse or elusive meaning or may be
just an expression of a speakers some psychological or mental attitude toward
it or an emotional reaction  cf. Mithun (1998).   iii) CAY suffixes, either derivational or inflectional, are pure and simple (or
canonical) suffixes in the sense that they are etymologically unrelated to any
stems in the language with which they may seem logically connected and that
none of them are all grammaticalizations of free (independent) or bound words. 1
The language has no explicit evidence either of enclitics having come from free
words or of suffixes from enclitics. None of the person suffixes for nominals
(marking possessors), for instance, are either enclitics or reduced forms of (syn-
chronic) free pronouns, as is also the case with verbal persons (for subject and
object), though, historically, some of Eskimo inflectional suffixes seem to have
1.   However, there may be cases of disagreement among Eskimologists. While some
     suggest a rapproachment of, for example, the stem |atuћլ-| something useful; to
     use, wear, sing with the NV suffix |+tuћլ-| to eat, wear, others seem not to con-
     nect (e.g. Mithun 2009: 13 vs. Fortescue et al. 1994: 53, 429). See (15) and (91).
     Very intriguing it seems, others may not be prepared to commit themselves to ei-
     ther, given our substantial lack of knowledge about Eskimo(-Aleut) historical
     morphology (e.g. basic root/stem construction) and the relatively simple syllable
     structure of (C)V(C) with relatively small inventories of vowels and consonants.
     An uncontestable exception would be the suffix NV |-klaaћ-| clock (in referring
     to hours) which is borrowed from the English clock as a suffix, but not as a stem
     (illustrated in § 11.3.6).
88 Morphological preliminariescognates in Aleut as Bergsland has argued (1951, etc.). That is, CAY is a lan-
guage for which suffixes, clitics, and free-standing words are clearly distinct
(even though free words may very often be articulated as part of bound phrases;
§ 2.3).
   There are a fair number of suffixes, however, which are composed of two or
more suffixes to be more or less fixed markers for grammatical categories  see
4.1.3.1-ii for composite suffixes.   iv) Although the predominant morphological process is suffixation, there a
few morphological anomalies (prefixation, root increment, suppletion, redupli-
cation, and phrasal compounds) specific to certain morphemes (§ 4.3-i through
v) as well as symbolistic (Sapir 1921: 133134, etc.) processes which have
grammatical significance, i.e. prosodic (disturbances of the regular pattern; con-
sonant gemination, vowel doubling) and phonemic (phonetic symbolism by
vowel height). Woodbury (1981b) supplies a fair amount of information of
symbolic processes from the Chevak dialect (HBC).","[138, 139, 140]"
"
2.2. A glimpse into the form    i) A linguistic articulation as a form is intrinsically linear by nature (Saus-
sures Principle One for the nature of the linguistic sign), 10 that is, a one-
dimensional expanse. But, in this respect, one may ask what it is that gives form
to an expanse. If it is two-dimensional sides that lend form to a tri-dimensional
expanse of a solid and if it is one-dimensional lines that lend form to a two-
dimensional expanse of a side, then two a-dimensional points (a beginning
and an end) are what lend form to a one-dimensional, i.e. linear, expanse. Forms
such as lines should have no internal divides. If human speech is based upon the
linear production of sounds, these points would be nothing but (potential)
pauses 11 (physiologically either with or without breathing) at the beginning and
the end of each form; cf. Andersons potential pause locations (1985: 151).
Fundamentally, therefore, a word as a form will not have an internal pause
without leaving behind a formally incomplete fragment. As a formally satisfy-
ing unit (Hattori 1950), it would not be until it is formed that a word attains
psychological reality  see also § 2.5-i.
    In this connection it might also be of some help to be reminded of the simple
fact that an isosceles triangle as a form, for instance, is taken as such only if it
has certain features (three lines or boundaries with two of equal length), howev-
er large the expanse or space (i.e. content) enclosed by the lines may be. This
10. Given the intrinsic linearity of human speech, constituent order in articulation is
    destined to take on different functions, either on the word-, phrase-, sentence-level,
    or further, depending upon languages (§ 4.2.5.2, § 5.4, etc.).
11. See Chao (1968: 153154) for Chinese, etc.
24 A word in Yupikcould suggest that grammatical and semantic content is secondary to words as a
linguistic form.
    Besides the psychological reality, an important corollary of morphological
articulation or the formhood may be that only when it is articulated or formed
can a word undergo change or dilution/bleaching in content as a whole, a phe-
nomenon that may be found in any human language. Expletives 12 (or meaning-
less particles far beyond more or less opaque lexicalizations or grammaticali-
zations) could be expected to serve in languages merely as empty fillers of
syntactic or phonological slots. Expletivity would be a sheer necessity for the
mere formhood of words as such.
    In this vein, some rare morphological processes in languages, apparently
anomalous or idiosyncratic, could be understood only if words are viewed as
nothing but a form (Miyaoka 2002: 143147)  § 2.3.3.    ii) As a matter of fact, it tends to be commonly accepted that a word is a stat-
ic, fixed, or ready-made entity established prior to each speaker and stored as a
single concept. In languages like Eskimo, however, words may also be a dy-
namic, flexible, and continuous form-giving process by which each speaker is
capable of producing a new word, even with a sentence-like content, a-matter-
of-coursely or far from being nonce or ad-hoc, although within certain limits (as
illustrated in § 4.2.5.4.1 in particular), and strictly following collectively shared
predetermined morphological and phonological patterns unique to the language
concerned (cf. § 2.5-i).
    As such, a CAY word has the potential to be full of content and functionally
equivalent to complex sentences in many other languages, packed with a variety
of concrete, abstract, and grammatical concepts (as if to the bursting point). At
the other extreme, in the same language, it may also be an expletive devoid of
content that merely fills out a sentence  e.g. cushion-like sentence fillers
(§ 53.6), which may have an important pragmatic effect. There should be noth-
ing surprising about this, given that a word as a mere form is, as Sapir (1921:
33) exquisitely defined it,  a definitely molded entity that takes in as much
or as little of the conceptual material of the whole thought as the genius of the
language cares to allow [emphasis mine]. If it were the case, this may lead to
the conclusion that, as far as a word is concerned, its syntactic or semantic rele-12. Expletives are words that are empty in content but simply fill a phonological
    and/or syntactical slot (cf. Latin explere to fill out) and are not necessarily limited
    to isolating languages characterized by high monosyllabicity (below). Whereas a
    word can be empty content-wise, a morpheme on the content plane, by definition,
    must be full (not meaningless). One may be reminded that Louis Hjelmslev felic-
    itously coined the glossematic terms plereme (with the same root to fill) corre-
    sponding to morphemes and ceneme (empty) to phonemes (then perhaps im-
    plying the meaningless morpheme as an oxymoron).
                                                          Bilateral articulation   25vance is secondary, and therefore attempts to define or analyze a word primarily
from a syntactic and/or a semantic standpoint could ultimately lead to the denial
of the concept of a word, or at least, for instance, to unrestrained use of the term
compound in linguistics descriptions for surprisingly varied entities across
languages. CAY incidentally has no compounds per se, as will be shown below
(§ 2.4, etc.).","[75, 76, 77]"
"Note that the last vowel to be doubled may not necessarily belong to a stem but
may belong to a suffix or an expander.
    There is a vocative suffix |-maa| my  !, which may possibly be a vowel-
doubled form of the possessed relative |-ma| my (REL.1sg.sg.), though it re-
mains a question why the relative case is used for this function. Illustrations in
§ 31.
    The deverbal particlizer VPc |+1paa| (~ |+vaa|) for exclamations (§ 52.3)
might also be characterized by the vowel doubling of the same element as in the
intensifier NN/VV |+1paћ-| big; greatly, VVa |+1pakaћլ-| so much, etc.
(§ 41.3.2).
    d. distance symbolism through vowel height: The high front vowel /i/ in a
number of CAY demonstrative roots seems to symbolize the spatial or temporal
proximity of the referent to the speaker. See Cooper and Ross (1975) for certain
types of sound symbolism in deictic demonstratives observed among the
worlds languages.
    The following parallelism from distal non-extended demonstrative roots
(NEX), Table 8 in § 12.1, show the four distals (DIS) have the shape |(C)a(k)m-|
with the low vowel /a/ while their corresponding proximal (PRX) have the high
front /i/  e.g. proximal vs. distal as in |am-| vs. |iƾ-| over there and |pakm-| vs.
|pik-| up above there; see § 4.3-ii for infix-like increment -k- in the latter.

Words  at the first stage of articulation at the content plane, starting from mor-
phemes, as the object of morphology  are further articulated (jointed together)
into so-called phrases, clauses, and sentences, commonly regarded as the object
of syntax (§ 2.2). As stated (§ 2.3), phrases are distinguished into bound
phrases and (free) phrases  the former is monoarticulous, while the latter is
multiarticulous (§ 2.4-v). Some of the (strongly) bound phrases in one end may
come close to compound words (in many other languages) and some others at
the other end may come close to (free) phrases, thereby constituting a hazy area
of gradience between morphology and syntax.
146 Syntactical preliminaries1. Constituents of clausesA typical CAY clause consists of two cores, i.e. a verb predicate (with its ad-
juncts) and one or two NPs (core nominal arguments). As the predicate, a VP in
CAY contains a single verb, with obligatory indexing of one or two core argu-
ments in inflection (pronominal arguments), hence an intransitive or a transi-
tive verb (§ 5.1.1). A verb may optionally be accompanied by its adjunct(s)
which include oblique (demoted) arguments, peripherals or adverbials (which
can be nominals, particles, and subordinate clauses), and cosubordinate clauses
(as used by Van Valin 1993).
    While one or two core arguments are obligatorily indexed in verb inflec-
tions, their external NPs are not obligatory. When external, the NP is marked
with a syntactic case  either absolutive or relative (§ 4.1.4, § 23 and § 24) 
and is cross-referenced with the person in verb inflection, agreeing in number
(obligatory verbal agreement).
    A core argument NP, marked with the absolutive or the relative case, can be
a single nominal, a nominal phrase (§ 5.1.2), or a nominalized clause (i.e. rela-
tive and nominal; § 17 and § 18), as is also the case for a non-core (demoted)
argument NP marked with the ablative-modalis, allative, or locative case. By
contrast, a peripheral (adverbial) argument NP is marked in one of the five
oblique cases (perlative and equalis besides the preceding three) but not indexed
in the predicate.
    Verbal agreement follows the subject-object (nominative-accusative) pattern.
The subject (S or A), the most important grammatical relation, functions as the
syntactic pivot. The subject status is given to the absolutive-case argument of
intransitive verbs and to the relative-case (i.e. ergative-case) argument of transi-
tive verbs. The absolutive-case argument for the latter is the object. The subject
controls reflexivization (with a reflexive pronoun; § 13.1, § 13.2) as well as the
reflexive third person (3R; § 22.2) in possessed nominals and in two non-
independent clauses  subordinate (characterized by the connective mood;
§ 50) and cosubordinate (appositional mood; § 51). A nominal clause, to be
complemented in the main clause, requires demotion of the subject of the origi-
nal clause into G function (relative case).
    Other constituents may include conjunctional, interjective, or vocative ele-
ments.
    A clause may form a compound or a complex sentence together with another
clause, hence biclausal, or may have another clause morphologically embedded,
forming a complex transitive verb or a comparative clause.
                                                     Constituents of clauses   1471.1. Verbs  intransitive vs. transitiveVerbs have two inflectional categories: person (subject and object) and mood.
The mood includes the indicative, participial, interrogative, and opta-
tive (independent or main-clause moods; § 46 through § 49), connective
(subordinate or adverbial mood; § 50), and appositional (cosubordinate; § 51).
Verbs with one core argument (subject) indexed in inflection are intransitive,
while those with two core argments (both subject and object) indexed are transi-
tive. This means that CAY verbs feature either mono- or bi-personal indexing,
but none with three or more persons despite the fact that a verb may be
ditransitive (trivalent) or multi-valent owing to valency increase (§ 39, § 40).
    In the following two examples with the indicative-mood predicate, (1) con-
tains an intransitive verb that is monopersonal with the subject (3sg.) indexed
in its inflection as P argument, while (2) contains a transitive verb that is
bipersonal with both the subject (3sg.) and the object (3pl.) person indexed
as A and P arguments. The compared sentence for (2) is a detransitivized or
intransitive construction (zero-derived antipassive), which is monopersonal with
only the subject person indexed as S argument:(1)         AngunS       tekite-llru-uq            unuk.
            man-ABS.sg. arrive-PST-IND.3sg.        night.ABS.sg.
            The man came at night.(2)         Angute-mA    ner-yug-ai                 cakneq      atsa-tP.
            man-REL.sg. eat-DES-IND.3sg.3pl. very.much          berry-ABS.pl.
            The man wants to eat the berries very much.
      cf.   AngunS=A     ner-yug-tuq                cakneq      atsa-nek (P).
            man.ABS.sg. eat-DES-IND.3sg.            very.much   berry-ABM.pl.
            The man wants to eat berries very much.A predicate verb (tekite-llru-uq, ner-yug-ai, ner-yug-tuq  all in the indicative
mood) is the obligatory constituent of a clause: It can be a complete sentence by
itself with no other words (core argument NP angun, angute-m or adverbial
adjunct unuk, cakneq), since any core arguments are indexed in the verb inflec-
tion as pronominal subject or object. See § 23.2 for peripheral function of unuk
in the absolutive case.
    Pragmatically, a core argument NP such as angute-m, angun, atsa-t in a syn-
tactic case generally carries old information and as a discourse topic it may
not commonly occur in utterances (§ 5.4.1).
148 Syntactical preliminaries1.1.1. Verb stems  primary and valency-modifiedCAY morphosyntactics show support for the classification of primary verb
stems (with no valency modification) into three types (3) in view of valency or
arguments involved, that is S, P, T, R, and A.   i) Primary verb stems: In terms of the number and kind of arguments in-
volved (§ 4.2.1-iii), they are:(3)   a. intransitive or monovalent (stems): with S; § 33
         e.g. |tai-| to come over, |iqa-| to be dirty
      b. monotransitive or bivalent (stems): with P (patient) and A (agent) or
         AIMP (impersonal agent); § 34
         e.g. |nѠћլѠ -| to eat (agentive, S=A), more examples in § 34.1
               |aѤћլ-| to tear (patientive, S=P), more examples in § 34.2
               |ciku-| to freeze, cold (impersonal patientive) in § 34.3
      c. ditransitive or trivalent (stems): with T (theme), R (recipient), and A
         (agent); § 35
         e.g. |cikiћլ-| to give (s.t.) to (secundative, S=R), more examples in
               § 35.1.1
               |kipuc-| to buy (for s.o.) (indirective, S=T), more examples in
               § 35.1.2.","[196, 197, 198, 199, 200]"
"The (a) and (b) group are described in separate chapters § 37 and § 38. The
former, i.e. relational verbs (a), are very productive in many ways, both syn-
chronically and diachronically, and will turn out to be the warp and weft of the
grammatical texture unique to CAY. Later chapters will clarify how important a
part relational verbs play in CAY grammar.    iv) Verb-elaborating suffixes (VV; § 39, § 40; § 41 through § 45)  modify a
preceding verb stem to form a verbally expanded stem, without converting the
word class. They are functionally most versatile and make up two groups in
terms of valency modification.
    One group is responsible for valency modification  increase, decrease, and
rearrangement of arguments  within simplex verbs (VVsm; § 39  e.g. causa-
tive, applicative, adversative, etc.) and for producing complex transitive
(VVcm; § 40  directive, speculative, causative, ignorative, etc.), which embeds
a simplex verb into a (possibly recursive) upper-layered clause with its own
agent argument (A') added.
    The other group involves no valency modification, but only concerns verbal
categories (VV; TAM, polarity, evidenciality, etc.), adverbial modifiers (of
manner, degree, location, time, etc.), and same-subject secondary verbs (e.g. to
wish to, pretend to, be tired of ing, etc.).
    Besides these major types, there are a few specific types of suffixes:   v) (Dis)honorific suffixes  include a fair number of NNh/VVh suffixes that
express an attitude/evaluation (e.g. affectionate, pejorative) of the speaker to-
122 Morphological preliminarieswards the person(s) or thing(s) concerned as the subject argument (S/A). One
and the same suffix works either NN or VV, but is conveniently illustrated in
§ 20.2 as NNh. Some suffixes of this type in particular have the peculiarity that
they are typically nomadic, floating among nominals or verbs, and others may
stand after particles or (inflected) personal pronouns and particles, reminding us
of postinflectional derivation (§ 4.1.3.2). 17   vi) Particle related suffixes  there are a small number of suffixes  cf.
§ 5.1.3.2  that may:(53) a. be added to particles  relational verb NVrv |+ƾu-| to be N, linker
        EX |+(V/VV)ћլ-| to utter/say, VVa |+1paћ-| to say loudly, possibly
        after particles as in § 41.3.2(111)
     b. be added to ignorative words and particles  intensifying VVa
        |-qapic-| ~ |-qapia(ћլa)ћլ-| (§ 41.3.1)
     c. particlize verb stems  exclamative VPc |+1paa| (§ 52.4.1)
2.5.2. Suffix orderThe considerable flexibility of word order within a sentence contrasts with the
relatively rigid suffix order within a word, which is, in general, determined se-
mantically, grammatically, and/or pragmatically. A suffix may have semantic
and/or syntactic scope over the immediately preceding suffix or an expanded
stem as a whole. Due to semantic or grammatical constraints, two suffixes may
occur in opposite positions, generally with some difference.
    Variously contrastive orders may be illustrated with two or three VV suffix-
es, each with different scopes, one of which is the reportative complex transitive
VVcm |+ni-| A' to say (§ 40.2.4):(54) a. pissur-ciq-ni-a                         she said he would go hunting
        hunt-FUT-A'.say-IND.3sg.3sg.
     b. pissur-ni-ciq-aa                        she will say he has gone hunting
        hunt-A'.say-FUT-IND.3sg.3sg.","[173, 174]"
"
3.1. Suffix ordersSince the scope of a derivational suffix is, in general, the immediately preceding
portion (either the stem, the suffix, or the whole) of the word, different suffix
orders inside a complex transitive verb yield semantic and (internal-)syntactic
relationships.",[1206]
"
1.1. Modifications    i) The valency inherent to primary stems, including both denominal and
root-expanded stems, may be subject to valency modification  increase or de-
crease by one argument as well as rearrangement of one argument with another
 by means of VVsm argumental suffixes (called simplex verb modifications;
§ 39) or VVcm suffixes (called complex transitive; § 40); see also § 4.1.3.1-
iii. By way of valency increase, a monovalent stem becomes an modified or
extended bivalent one, a bivalent one becomes a trivalent (distinct from a pri-
mary ditransitive), a ditransitive one becomes quadrivalent. As valency modifi-
cations can be recursive and cumulative, an extended (or secondary) stem may
be multi-valent (with actually up to six or even seven arguments, as testified).
    The valency increase in simplex verbs by VVsm concerns arguments such
as, in particular, A (agent-adding , i.e. causative, monotransitivizer), E (applica-
                                                 Valency and its modifications   869tive or adversative extension  beneficiary, recipient/goal/location, company,
item carried, as well as sufferer), and A IMP (aside from the one inherent to pri-
mary impersonal verb stems). By contrast, valency increases by VVcm form a
complex transitive stem with A', A'',     (agents for upper-layer verbs, e.g. caus-
ative, speculative, reportative, and so on), which may be cumulative.
    Argumental suffixes VVsm and VVcm directly affect the voice of a verb
and the case assignment of core arguments (§ 30), thus constituting one of the
most central aspects of CAY morphosyntax.
    There are also a small number of VVsm suffixes that are responsible for va-
lency decrease and rearrangement (§ 39.3, § 39.6).    ii) To give some idea of verb modification, a simple example is given with a
monovalent stem |uivѠ-| to circle, with intransitive -uq (IND.3sg.) and tran-
sitive -aa (IND.3sg.3sg.); valency-increasing suffixes are emphasized:(2)   a. uiv-uq                  it is going around in circle
      b. uiv-Ø-aa                it is going around it (e.g. a house)  zero-
                                 derived locational P addition (§ 33.4.1)
          uiv-t-aa               he turns it (e.g a cup) around  A adding
                                 (causative) VVsm |+c-| (§ 39.1.1)
          uiv-ut-aa              he is taking it (with himself) as he goes
                                 around  E adding VVsm |+(u)c-| (§ 39.4)
      c. uiv-ut-ni-a             he says (s.o.) is taking it  with reportative
                                 VVcm |+ni-| (§ 40.2.4)
      d. uiv-ut-ni-yuk-aqa       I think he says someone is taking (s.t.)  with
                                 speculative VVcm |+1cukѠ-| (§ 40.2.3). in which a) is monovalent, b) bivalent, c) trivalent (with two valency-
increasing suffixes) and d) quadrivalent (with three). Whatever the valency of a
verb may be (or however multivalent a verb may be), core arguments coded in
verb inflection are limited to two (transitive inflection with subject and object)
or one (intransitive inflection with subject). All the other arguments are obliga-
torily subject to a process that may be called argument reduction (iii below
and § 30.3). The inflection shows that only (a) above is an intransitive verb,
while all the rest are transitive, and all in the indicative mood. Both (c) and (d)
are complex transitives.
    This comes with a caveat, however, that appositional-mood verbs have only
one core argument (S or P) marked even if the verb is transitive, and the un-
marked A argument is known by its coreferentiality with the main-clause
subject (§ 51, § 51.1.4).
870 Verb inflection    iii) The argument reduction (mentioned just above) is made by means of
demotion (of two types) in particular so that an argument lower in the ar-
gument hierarchy for case marking can be promoted and foregrounded
(§ 30.3.1). Two subjects in connection with a complex transitive A' (§ 45.2)
may be subject to reduction by way of their coreference (§ 40.1-iii).
    A transitively-inflected verb may be detransitivized or intransitivized,
which is a particular case of argument reduction, by means of several pro-
cesses: passivization, antipassivization (type 1 demotion), medialization, and
reflexivization / reciprocalization (§ 34.1 and § 34.2).   iv) The subject and object arguments (i.e. core arguments) can be ex-
pressed externally with an NP marked with one of the syntactic cases, i.e. the
absolutive case (S, P) or the relative case (A) on an ergative basis. But we
have to add the important caveat that this is only the case when the argument
refers to the third person (§ 23.1, § 24.2). An NP referring to a non-third per-
son is marked neutrally (i.e. S = P = A) by the locative case (§ 27.4).
   A demoted argument is expressed by an NP in the ablative-modalis
(§ 25.2.1  type 1) or allative cases (§ 26.2  type 2 demotion).
   An adverbial adjunct may be expressed overtly by an NP in one of the
oblique cases (§ 25 ~ § 29) or in the absolutive case for time nouns (§ 23.2).    v) Finally, verbs may be subject to transcategorial conversion, i.e. nomi-
nalization, by a VN suffix (§ 17 through § 19). Together with verbalization by
an NV suffix (§ 37 through § 38), the conversions of the two opposite direc-
tions are equally productive and may occur successively, and it is thus very
commonly the case that a word changes its morphological status (verbal or
nominal) a number of times in the course of word expansion, thereby increasing
the degree of synthesis.
    This category change implies that, whether the primary stem of a word is
verbal or nominal, and no matter how many class-converting suffixes might
follow the stem, the word is a verb only if the morpheme that immediately pre-
cedes the inflection is verbal  i.e. a (primary) verb stem, a verb-elaborating
suffix (VV type), or a verbalizing or denominalizing suffix (NV type). The
word is nominal, on the other hand, only if the morpheme that immediately
precedes the inflection is nominal  i.e. a (primary) nominal stem, nominal-
elaborating suffix (NN type), or a nominalizing or deverbalizing suffix (VN
type).
                                                    Subject and object persons   8711.2. Intransitive vs. transitiveAs mentioned (§ 2.1), a stem is a pre-formal unit of content and, as such, has
to be inflected verbally (or nominally) in order to be realized (i.e. articulated) as
a form (articulus) or a word.    i) Whether a stem is primary or extended (modified), and no matter how
many arguments (the level of valency) a stem may have, only one or two argu-
ments can be indexed as core argument(s) in an inflection, thereby forming an
intransitive or transitive verb respectively, as stated above. While intransitive
verbs index one core argument as the subject person in their inflection, transi-
tive verbs have two core arguments as the subject and the object.
    A so-called second or indirect object (of ditransitive verbs; § 35) is not
marked inflectionally, as one of the arguments T or R being obligatorily demot-
ed (i.e. CAY has no tri-personal inflection like Basque, for instance). This
means that a tri- or multi-valent stem has to be subject to the argument reduc-
tion of one or two arguments, accompanied by obligatory case alternations for
the NPs concerned.
    To speak of an intransitive vs. transitive distinction, ditransitives and com-
plex transitives (§ 40) may also be inflected intransitively or transitively, de-
spite the terms. The antipassives (or half-transitives) are intransitively inflect-
ed verbs. Note also that, as stated in § 4.2.1-ii, CAY comparative verbs (§ 45)
as well as relational (or equational) verbs (§ 37) may be either transitive or in-
transitive.   ii) The categories for which verbs are inflected are the person (combined
with number distinction) of core arguments (§ 32.2) and mood (§ 32.4); see
also§ 4.2.4. Morphologically, a mood marker and a person (number) marker
occur in that order, although there is a certain extent of fusion in the composi-
tion. Each mood has its own set of inflections as given in Tables 46 through 49.
The indicative and the participial moods, however, share the same set of person
markers (Table 46), though with distinct mood markers.
   In CAY, either grammatical gender distinction or noun classification is alien
 hence the conveniently used gloss he/she/it for a third person singular,
above. Alienability is not a grammatical category for the language, either.","[920, 921, 922, 923]"
"   Permutability (indicated by ҥ ; cf. i14.3.3) seems always allowed with ap-
positive phrases (unlike juxtaposed phrases; § 16.3), that is, head-modifier order
or modifier head order, and insertion by another word is possible. Thus, the
preceding (1) with the interrogative particle |qaa| (§ 53.2) added to form a non-
enclitic phrase:
2.    A qasgiq used to be a highly regarded men's house (commonly used for festivals,
      young mens education, etc.) where women are not allowed in except for festivals.
      Nowadays it functions as a community hall. By contrast, the ena house was, ac-
      cording to Kanaqlak (2011: 31), the domain for the women, where young girls
      were taught the essence of the womanhood.

"
2.5.5.2 Splitting with expletive |pi-|  periphrastic constructionsMore systematic and extensive than the preceding lexical periphrasis, synthetic
verbs (certain denominal verbs and expanded verb with VV suffixes) may be
rendered periphrasically by splitting them into two independent words, with the
use of the expletive and ambivalent pro stem |pi-| thing; to do (§ 10.3.1, etc.),
thereby serving discourse functions in particular (spotlighting, shading off, indi-
rectness, etc.).    i) Nominal splitting: A synthetic denominal verb (N + NV) may be split into
a full NP and a |pi-| verb. The suffix requires a prop |pi-| in order to reset a
word, while the discharged 㔥⇡ 18 or stranded noun is inflected with the abla-
tive-modalis (§ 25.2.2).
    In the following example, (a) is a denominal verb (intransitive) with an S ar-
gument, while (b) has the nominal stem qayar-pa(g)- big kayak stranded into
an ablative-modalis NP, with the prop verb used to reset the rest of the original
verb -ngqer-tuq. Splitting as in (b) may yield room for focusing the big kayak.
Either word order is possible, with some pragmatic difference.(93) a. qayar-pa-ngqer-tuq
        kayak-big-have-IND.3sg.
     b. qayar-pag-mek(P)      pi-ngqer-tuq ~ pi-ngqer-tuq qayar-pag-mek
        kayak-big-ABM.sg. PI-have-IND.3sg.
        he [S] has a big kayak.",[188]
"    A pause may give more emotional value to a sentence, as in the following af-
ter the particle nakleng:(44)      Nakleng(,) [tau-na             angun]S      tuqute-llini-lria

Part 3
Nominals
CAY nominals as a word class inflect just as verbs do, though in their own
unique way (but opposed to non-inflecting words, that is, particles and enclitics;
§ 52 through § 54) in that they are morphologically composed of a stem (incl.
root-derived one), derivational suffix(es), and an inflection, occurring in that
order, although the derivation is not obligatory. Nominals together with nominal
phrases are surveyed in § 10 through § 16. § 10 includes brief survey of am-
bivalent stems (and roots) which are subject to both nominal and verbal inflec-
tions (cf. § 32). Possible derivations include nominalized clauses, i.e. relative
clauses and nominalizations (§ 17, § 18), as well as deverbal nouns (§ 19) and
nominal elaborations (§ 20).
    An inflection (sometimes called an ending) for nominals is a combination
of (partly fused) case, number, and person (possessor) (§ 10.1). The case marks
the syntactic function (whether core or oblique of an argument NP  § 23
through § 29). Nominal referents are classified by number (§ 21) and optionally
by person (§ 22).
    Gender, nominal classification, numeral classifiers, and (in)alienability are
grammatically alien to CAY. There is no animate vs. inanimate classification
either in its nominal system except that personal pronouns (§ 13) are restricted
to humans. The system of nominal demonstratives with thirty distinct roots
serves a classificatory and a definite article-like function on nouns, however
(§ 12.2).
    An NP, which can be a single nominal, a nominal phrase, or a nominalized
clause (relativization and nominalization), stands as the S, P, T, R, or A core
argument of a clause (T and R for ditransitives), or their demoted ones, as an
attributive adjunct (in G function) to its head NP or as an adverbial adjunct (in
an oblique function), depending upon the case marking (unless vocative or
interjective). A core argument NP is cross-referenced in number with the predi-
cate verb.

1. Nominal inflectionsNominals inflect for the basic grammatical categories of number (§ 21), per-
son (§ 22), and case (§ 23 through § 29), serving to indicate the grammatical
functions and to characterize subclasses of nominals (§ 11 through § 15). No
subclass lacks case inflection, but not all nominals fully inflect for every catego-
ry. Common nouns show the fullest inflection and may have extensive deriva-
tion, while other nominals have less inflection and much more limited deriva-
tion. The morphological and syntactic peculiarities of these are treated in
respective chapters.   i) Number: Number is an obligatory category for nominals, which inflect
for one of three numbers, i.e. singular, dual, and plural (§ 21), except for
adverbial demonstratives and ignoratives, which lack number inflection
(§ 12.2.1).    ii) Person: Person is an optional category for nominals, marking the posses-
sor: A nominal may be unpossessed (Table 20) or possessed (Table 2123).
There are certain constructions for which the person marking is obligatory. (By
contrast, person is always obligatory in verbs to mark the subject and the object
persons  § 32). The nominal person (possessor) typically occurs with common
nouns and, to a very limited extent, for other nominals, but never for adverbial
demonstratives. Four nominal persons (for possessor) are distinguished, i.e.
first, second, third, and reflexive-third persons 1 (§ 22).
    Some nominal person (for possessor) markers are apparently identical with
verbal person markers (for subject and object).","[315, 316, 317, 318, 319]"
"   While apparently very rare, triple marking is also attested, cf. (195b) and
(109b):(112)     Uksuar-mi-mi-tun           kiircet-uq.
          fall-LOC-LOC-EQL           warm-IND.3sg.
          It is as warm as it was in (that particular) fall. [EM.BH]   Adverbial demonstratives:(113)     ma-a-ni-tun       like here
           but not the nominal demonstrative *ma-ku-mi-tun like in this one
          (though ma-ku-miu-tun like a dweller here is quite possible).(114)     akm-a-ni-(ce)tun like across there, like in the lower 48 states. [HO]   The following, as it is narrated, is confusing but presents an interesting case
of what may be called word order crossing between two nominal phrases (a
kind of detached articulation; § 2.3.3). The word kinguner-mi-tun constitutes
case marker doubling. The two nominal phrases, i.e. the adjunctional phrase of
similarity, i.e. kingunermitun ayuqelriamun, and the attributive phrase, i.e.
Yupiat qasgiatun, are crossed in word order, and the four-word phrase in turn
constitutes an appositive phrase to the allative qasgi-mun preceding the word
order crossed phrase [ ]:(115)     Tua=i       qasgi-mun     [Yupia-tG       kinguner-mi-tun

"1.   This classification of enclitics as non-inflecting in CAY and some languages of the
     world does not exclude the possibility of enclitics being inflectable. Beja or Ngi-
     yambaa, an Australian language, is reported to have a clitic inflected with the plural
     suffix; Klavans (1979: 73)  cf. Zwicky and Pullum (1983: 504) and Anderson
     (1992: 222). See also Miyaoka (2002: 8182, etc.) for a small number of verbal en-
     clitics susceptible of inflection (e.g. =da).

   Although an enclitic always forms a part of single articulus (enclitic bound
phrase), it is less subject than a suffix to the cohesive forces inside the articulus.
Suffixes and enclitics have different boundary-signaling features in prosody and
their segmental realizations (§ 8.4).   iii) Enclitics are unanalyzable, i.e. monomophemic and many particles are
also unanalyzable, but many other particles are clearly or apparently derivatives
and allow a greater or lesser degree of analysis (polymorphemic).
   Some particles even appear to be petrified remnants of originally inflected
words. Some nominals, still retaining a degree of inflection, may be classed as
particles, though their categorical demarcation may be difficult to make.    iv) An enclitic may be accented, depending upon syllabic sequence of a
whole enclitic bound phrase (§ 8.1), e.g. |=lu| in (2) below, as contrasted with
(1).   v) One enclitic may be followed by another as in (2) below (and further by
another), but they are largely constrained in a relative order, as contracted with
particles, which have more flexibility in this regard.(1)        |qayaћլ+paћ-li+viћ[+Ø=lu| /qayá[ ҕ|palí‫|ޞ‬vik=ܾu/ qayarpalivik=llu

"
1.3. Non-templatic polysynthesisAs stated, CAY, like other Eskimo languages, has a remarkably high degree of
synthesis owing to the availability, and recursive occurrence, of a great number
of highly productive derivational suffixes (including transcategorial ones). The-
se occur in sequence with semantic compatibility, with possible different suffix
orderings as a reflection of different scopes. The flow of a word is thus charac-
terized by a method of pruning afterthoughts (Sapir 1921: 135, fn. 10). The
remarkably high degree of polysynthesis, as will be amply illustrated (§ 4.2.5.3
and § 4.2.5.4), is obviously attained by the non-templatic nature of its deriva-
tional suffixation (Mithun 1999: 43).
    In this respect, CAY polysynthesis is remarkably contrasted with many other
polysyntetic languages of the North Pacific Rim. The language, for instance,
flatly precludes a slot-and-filler template analysis as first employed by Sapir
and Hoijer (1967) for Athabaskan verbs, in which a good number of rigid pre-
root slots (or morphological positions) and a few post-root ones are paradig-
matically filled. In contrast, CAY suffixation is semantically conditioned in
general, with a suffix having its immediately preceding morpheme (or se-
quence) as its scope, and it is semantic compatibility rather than position class
that is the guiding structural principle, with the result that different suffix orders
are possible. Even in Eskimo languages, however, it is necessary to
2.   This is in stark contrast to plurality in some Northwest Coast languages south of
     Alaskan Yupik, for instance, in Sliammon (Salish), where it is covered morpholog-
     ically by three different suffixes, ablaut, and two types of reduplication, while the
     other nine types of reduplication are employed for other grammatical functions
     (such as aspect and forming diminutives) (Watanabe 2003). In Coast Tshimshian
     (Tsimshianic), it is usually characterized by reduplication, prefixation (two prefix-
     es), suppletion, suffixation (three suffixes), their combinations (prefix + reduplica-
     tion, reduplication + suffix, prefix + suffix, and suppletion + reduplication), and,
     sporadically, by unchanged plurals and a few other unclassifiable processes
     (Sasama 2001).
90 Morphological preliminariesacknowledge the tendency toward some extent of templatic ordering among
certain verb-elaborating derivational suffixes (VV; § 4.2.5.1), most notably, in
suffix compositions (§ 4.1.3.1-ii) which are semi-lexicalized (Fortescue 1980,
and its discussions in Woodbury 1981: 318331 for the Chevak dialect of
CAY), and in derivational vs. inflectional ordering in itself. See § 4.2.5.2 and
§ 4.2.5.3.
   CAY does not have noun incorporation either (as stated; § 2.1-i), which is
an important morphological device for many polysynthetic languages in the
North Pacific Rim, such as Chukchi-Koryak (T. Kurebito 2001a, M. Kurebito
2001). Furthermore, CAY not only lacks the nominal suffixes as noted just
above in Mosan languages, but also such instrumental or locational affixes
(prefixes) widely employed in North American languages, though these are
often taken as one necessary characteristic of polysynthesis (Mattissen 2003,
writing on Nivkh in Sakhalin). CAY instrumental or locational suffixes are of a
totally different kind.
   In § 4.2.5.1, derivational suffixes are classified, but a few features responsi-
ble for polysynthesis are mentioned beforehand:
1.3.1. Derivational suffixes in advance   i) CAY derivational suffixes, standing between a stem and an inflection, are
recursive and a word may repeatedly switch back and forth between nominals
and verbs by means of transcategorial, i.e. nominalizing and verbalizing, suf-
fixes as illustrated in § 4.2.5.1. Because of the transcategorial conversions in
particular (fully illustrated in § 4.2.5.4.1, § 20.4, § 37.5.3.2, etc.), it is hard to
define an upper limit in polysynthesis of CAY words.    ii) In addition to an abundance of primary suffixes, there are many second-
ary or composite suffixes consisting of two (or more) suffixes, which, more
or less fixed and lexicalized/grammaticalized. Many of them are (very) produc-
tive and responsible for transcategorial conversions as illustrated in § 4.2.5.3.
Some composite suffixes, however, can be deceptive unless precise analysis
based on proper phonological adjustments is applied. In addition to being a
primary suffix, the causative suffix -cir- (§ 39.1.3), for instance, may reflect
different morphological sources; see i), iii), iv) under the verbalizing |-liћլ-|
(§ 38.3).
    Many composite suffixes show what may be called cyclical expansion
(though not necessarily a felicitous term) by a pair of suffixes, that is,
1ĺ9ĺ1 (starting from a nominal and back to a nominal) DQG 9ĺ1ĺ9
(starting from a verb and back to a verb). And such cyclical derivation may also

exemplified in (44) by a nominal clause with successive derivations.
                                                          General characteristics   91   This kind of recursive cyclical expansion may involve a nominalization (a
nominal or a relative clause), which can further be subject to verbalization, with
each process recursive, as will be illustrated in § 17 and § 18. Verbalization of
nominalized clauses is referred to as reverbalization and nominalization of
verbalized clauses as renominalization.
   The recursive transcategorial conversion is a productive process retained
more or less by CAY speakers (to different extents). Through cyclical expan-
sion, the process is a resourceful device for a language endowed only with suf-
fixation, though it is one of the features of the language that is markedly on the
wane among younger speakers. It is not merely a synchronic process, however.
Cyclical expansion itself has been an important diachronic process as well, one
that is deep-rooted in the languages history. As a matter of fact, a fair number
of basic and productive grammatical markers  such as (clausal) negation, past
tense, complex verb, comparative clause, and valency modification (increase
and rearrangement)  are fixed cyclical expansions of VN+NV type. See
§ 4.2.5.3 below for illustrations.    iii) The non-templatic polysynthetic morphology is also explored by multi-
valent verbs (VVsm; § 39) and in the multi-layered morphological embedding
of a clause into an upper clause by means of complex transitive suffixes
(VVcm; § 40) 3  as illustrated by he thinks that she came here, he asked
someone to let her come here, in which he is the transitive subject and
she/her is the transitive object. A complex verb is in contrast to a simplex
verb, while the latter may or may not be extended by VVcm suffixe(s) or not.
    An upper clause (complex verb) may be further expanded by its own elabo-
rating suffixes including nominalization and its reverbalization, the result of the
former being a concatenated relative clause like the one who I thought is a
man (Otto Jespersen  cf. § 4.2.5.4.1, § 17.7, § 40.4.1). The language can also
have a concatenated comparative clause like he is smaller than I thought you
are (§ 45.1.3), a concatenated interrogative clause like who do you think has
arrived? (§ 48.2.1), and a concatenated adverbial clause like he made it as I
assumed he would (§ 40.4.2).","[141, 142, 143]"
"   Appositive phrasal numerals for expressing multiplication, consisting of two
(or more) basic numerals (Table 10), such as tallima-n (5-ABS.pl.) yuina-a-t
(20-EV-ABS.pl.) hundred (i.e. five times twenty), are detailed in § 14.3.2.      iii) With a location noun (§ 11.2.1):(11)         kiag-mi               [puqla-mG           nalli-ini]

2.2. Constituents of inflecting words  stem, derivation, and inflectionAs stated, inflecting words, either verbs or nominals, morphologically consist of
two obligatory constituents, a stem (called a base by some Eskimologists),
which always comes word-initially, and an inflection, which stands finally to
morphologically complete an inflecting word as a form, signaling its end.
   It is the inflection that determines the word class, but not a word-initial stem
(or root). A stem can be indefinite or ambivalent (nominal and verbal) and can
change the class repeatedly by transcategorial suffixes within a word (§ 4.2.5.1).
A stem may have a sequence of recursive transcategorial suffixes, finally be-
coming either a noun or a verb depending upon the functional kinds of the suf-11. The index of comparison |-nћլu-| can also occur with a denominal relational verb
    (e.g. to be an old woman) or with the verb to choose, prefer  cf. § 45.1.4.
102 Morphological preliminariesfixes involved. A good number of apparently ambivalent stems in CAY (listed
in § 10.4) may not be a problem to be dealt with using the so-called zero-
derived transcategorial conversions.   i) Stem and inflection  Only one stem occurs in each word (as stated). The
single-stem principle is very strict in CAY word formation, implying the com-
plete avoidance of stem compounding apart from a few cases of phrasal com-
pounds (single words, as stated) as morphological anomalies (§ 2.3, § 4.3.6) and
of noun incorporation as a means of compounding noun and verb stems.
   Inflection, which consists of one, two, or three inflectional suffixes that are
often fused, encodes the obligatory categories of:
   a. mood and person (subject and object) for verbs  § 32
   b. case, number, and person (possessor) for nominals  § 21 through § 29.    ii) Derivation  Between the stem and the inflection there may optionally
occur another constituent, i.e. one or more derivational suffixes. The order of
the three constituents cannot be permutated.
    Thus the structure of inflecting words  nominals (N) and verbs (V)  is rep-
resented by example (1) above and exemplified by (2) and (3), etc.
    In CAY, tense-aspect is optionally provided by verbal derivation (verb-
elaborating VVt suffixes; § 42) or lexically by some particles. Modality and
evidentiality are likewise provided optionally by verb elaborating suffixes
(modal VVm; § 43) or by some particles but also partly an inflectional category
(for illocutionary force; declaratives, interrogatives, imperatives, and optatives,
see § 46 through § 49). Polarity or verbal negation (VVn) is expressed by nega-
tive suffixes (§ 44).    iii) Two kinds of suffixes  derivational and inflectional, the former of which
forms a semi-closed class and the latter a closed class, are morphologically dis-
tinct. While derivational suffixes are a lexical means of creating new words,
they also have extensive syntactic relevance. The notion that derivational suf-
fixes are unproductive while inflectional ones are productive is totally alien to
CAY. Concerning the distinction between the two, Mithun (1983: 238) once
suggested that expressions which speakers of the language may have thought to
be more important at one stage have been morphologized into (derivational)
suffixes while the most important ones that they determined to be obligatory
have been morphologized into inflections.   iv) Roots  A good number of stems cannot be followed directly by inflec-
tions unless immediately expanded by one of a limited number of (derivational)
suffixes. They are referred to as roots (§ 10.5) and the expanding suffixes as
root expanders (EX), some of which are specific to roots while others are not.
A root followed by a root expander functions as a stem (root-derived stem;

derivational suffix(es).
    It is to be noted that many roots are more or less indeterminate as to being
either nominal or verbal  see § 10.5. Verbal roots have no valency, i.e. a-
valent. All demonstratives (§ 12) and some ignoratives (§ 15.2) begin with
roots. Demonstrative roots are expanded into nominal, adverbial, and verbal
demonstrative stems by their particular expanders (§ 12.2, § 12.3, § 12.4).","[153, 154, 155]"
"Some NV suffixes may be semantically quasi-equivalent to verb stems. The
denominal verb (a) in the following example with NV |+tuћլ-| to eat (§ 38.2)
may generally have the same meaning as the analytic expressions (b) with the
verb from the stem |nѠћլѠ-|, as mentioned in fn.1. However, aside from the many
younger speakers who clearly tend to use analytic expressions, there seems to
be some pragmatic difference between the use of single words and periphrastic
sentences.(91) a. atsa-tur-tuq           he is eating berries
        berry-eat-IND.3sg.  |+tuћլ-|

         see also (93) and § 5(87) for the word order.",[187]
"   Juxtaposed phrases with two two-digit numbers like 20 and 10 may allow
permutation, however.(54)      yuinaq       qula thirty (20+10)  better in this order than otherwise

           qula can stand at the initial position, but the order shown is preferred.",[528]
"1.1. Third-person possessor in attributive phrasesA third-person possessor marking is obligatory in the head NP of attributive (geni-
tive) phrases (§ 16.4). It agrees in number with the dependent NP in the relative
case, as shown in the following, which adds a dependent NP to (6) above:

          He likes Mayaqs daughter.    The relative word order between the possessor nominal, i.e. Mayam, and the
possessum, i.e. pania, is not relevant, though the former may tend to precede
the latter, that is, A+N type.
    Whichever word order it may take, (7) can have another reading, however,
due to the two functions of the relative case (A and G; § 24.1 and § 24.2). The
relative-case Mayam in G function in (7) can also be in A function for a transi-
tive construction as in the following, that is, an explicit NP for (6):(8)       Maya-mA             pani-aP           assik-aa.

the possessor in G function and the possessum as the head:(9)       angi-i-gemtaG       pani-kek    our (two) uncles daughters.

"The predicate nallu-aqa in (b) may come at the beginning or may even split
inside the relative clause, which itself can reverse the internal word order. The
head noun arnaq (woman) of the relative clause (b) may not be externally
expressed, since the deverbalized clause alone can work as an argument (the
one who (had) arrived).
    CAY has a number of relativizing VNrl suffixes which differ in arguments
to be selected for the head  see § 17.2 through § 17.6.

Part 6
Verbs
Morphological constitution of CAY verbs is the same as for nominals, that is,
they consist of one stem, derivational suffix(es), and an inflection (or an end-
ing), occurring in that order. It is a verbal inflection that completes a verb
morphologically. Since no derivational suffix is obligatory (unlike the stem
and the inflection), a stem can be closed directly by an inflection. Some stems
may consist of a root and a root expander (EX), a kind of derivational suffix.
A root alone cannot be directly followed by an inflection.
   A verb inflection is a combination (occasionally fused) of two inflectional
suffixes coding its obligatory grammatical categories  person (for both sub-
ject and object) and mood, as opposed to nominals with case, number, and
person (possessor). Inflected verbs are either intransitive with the subject
marked or transitive with both the subject and object marked. Tense, aspect,
modality, negation, and evidentiality belong to derivational morphology.
   Verb-related derivational suffixes, which may optionally occur, have a
very wide range of functions. They are responsible for:   i. adverbial modification (VVa; § 41)
   ii. grammatical modification tense and aspect (VVt; § 42), modality
        (VVm; § 43), evidentiality (VVe; § 43.2), negation (VVn; § 44), and
        comparison, § 45)
   iii. valency modification (VVsm, VVcm; § 39, § 40)
   iv. verbalization (NVrv, NV; § 37, § 38)
   v. nominalization (VNrl, VNnm, VV; § 17, § 18, § 19).

1. Valency and its modificationsPrimary stems (with no valency modified) involve one, two, or three arguments:(1)        intransitive (monovalent)                        S (intransitive subject)
           monotransitive (bivalent)                        P (patient) and A (agent)
           ditransitive (trivalent)                         T (theme), R (recipient), and A    S may or may not be a volitional agent, that is, it may be active or inac-
tive.
    P is the patient-like argument of a verbal event, while A is the one that initi-
ates the event toward P and is the more active participant with higher control. A
presupposes P but not vice versa. Monotransitive or bivalent stems can be
³DJHQWLYH´ 3  6 $ RU ³SDWLHQWLYH´ 3 6  $  DQG $ RI VRPH SDWLHQWLYH
bivalent stems is impersonal, i.e. A IMP., something like an uncontrollable natural
or supernatural force: see Table 25.
    Ditransitives, which indicate the transference of possession (to give T to
R), change of location (to throw T to R), etc., are either indirective with T
foregrounded or secundative with R foregrounded.
    Each type of stem will be detailed in § 33 through § 35. However, the three-
way classification of primary stems into intransitive, monotransitive, and
ditransitive should not be taken as hard and fast. It is a common observation that
a certain degree of variation or discrepancy occurs among individuals, genera-
tions, and dialects regarding how they handle a specific stem or a certain group
of stems. It is sometimes the case that some kinds of stems are treated different-
ly; for instance, as intransitive by some speakers but as monotransitive by oth-
868 Verb inflectioners, possibly with slightly different implications (e.g. |kic-| to sink), and that a
few bi- and trivalent stems may vary as well.
    Some monovalent stems correspond semantically with the predicative adjec-
tives of other languages, but in CAY it would be difficult to set up the category
of adjectives as a separate word class. The parameter of comparison, for in-
stance, could not be deemed a criterial property in this regard (§ 45.1.4).
    Secondary stems, which have valency increase (A, E, A IMP or A' VVsm,
VVcm; § 32.1.1 below as well as § 38, § 39), may also be bivalent, trivalent, or
multi-valent. AIMP argument as indicated by a valency-increasing suffix is dis-
tinct from that involved in primary (bivalent) stems (cf. above) and is something
akin to necessity or destiny.
    A verb stem may be denominal, consisting of a nominal stem followed by a
verbalizing suffix NV (§ 37 and § 38). Denominal stems are mono- or bi-valent
(except for the ditransitive-like |pi-li-| to make something for someone,
§ 10.3.1, § 34.7).
    The language does not have a copula stem with such arguments as CS
(copula subject) or CC (copula complement); see Curnow (2001) and Dix-
on (2002) for the terms. CAY relational verbs (§ 4.2.1-ii, § 37 e.g. X is Y)
are not copulas, but can be transitive as well as intransitive and are not only
stative, but can also be inchoative (e.g. X becomes Y (§ 37.3, § 37.4).
    In addition, CAY has a considerable number of roots that are a-valent and
involve no argument (§ 36). They cannot be inflected unless expanded into
stems by a root expander (EX) which supplies one argument or two. A root-
expanded stem can thus be monovalent or bivalent depending upon the type of
expander the root selects. It can be followed by an inflection without any inter-
vening derivation (except for the expander).","[915, 916, 917, 918, 919, 920]"
"   A long sequence of suffixes may cause some confusion for some speakers.
In the following two words with reverse-ordered suffixes, the second may be
taken as having the meaning of the first (though not vice versa):(57) a. pissur-ciqe-nqigg-ni-a   she says that he will go hunting again
        hunt-FUT-again-A'.say-IND.3sg.3sg.
     b. pissur-ciq-ni-nqigt-aa   she again says that he will go hunting
        hunt-FUT-A'.say-again-IND.3sg.3sg.",[175]
"   The third person makes a formal distinction between the absolutive (S func-
tion) and the relative (A function) as follows:(224) a. Ellii-XִrluqS           akalla-urt-uq.
         3sg.-HNR.ABS            old-become-IND.3sg.
         He (poor) has grown old.
      b. Elle-Xִrlu-anA         ene-k-aa.
         3sg.-HNR-REL.           house-have.as-IND.3sg.3sg.
         It is his (poor) house (lit. he (poor) has it as a house).
          cf. elliin REL.3sg. (< |ѠѤѠ+ƾan|).  iv) Suffix order: The difference in the relative order below concerning the
HNR suffix reflects the different scopes of the suffixes:(225) a. ene-Xִrlu-q-aqa                        it is my poor house (condition)
         house-HNR-have.as-IND.1sg.3sg.
      b. ene-ke-Xִrlur-aqa ~ ene-ke-Xִrlur-qa
         house -have.as-HNR-IND.1sg.3sg.
         it is, poor me, my house (lit. poor me, I have this as a house).   v) As a VV suffix  very common:(226)       qasgi-Xִrlur-tuq
            go.to.qasgiq-HNR-IND.3sg.
            he (pitiful, poor, small) went to the mens house.",[743]
"
5. Linkers (linking suffixes)A linking suffix or a linker (LNK) |+(V~ VV)ћլ-| (glossable somewhat like to
say) is required to make two kinds of words inflectable (with or without deriva-
tion intervening):   i) Non-inflecting words (incl. enclitics): when they are to be uttered by citing
them, like he said and, goodbye, stop!, thank you, etc.   ii) English loanwords: not Russian ones, however, which have long since
been adopted into a part of Yupik lexicon). The fact that such linkers are neces-
sary in order for English words to be capable of inflections means that these
loanwords have not yet been fully integrated into Yupik and are treated as a
type of non-inflecting words.",[1565]
"
2.4. Inflectional suffixes (inflections)Together with stems, inflections are obligatory elements in inflecting words
(except for the optional category of person [possessor] for nominals). 14 An in-
flection consists of no less than three inflectional suffixes encoding such gram-
matical categories as number, person (possessor), and case for nominals, and
person (subject and object) and mood for verbs, which are often phonologically
fused. Tense-aspect and modality are not inflectional categories of the language
but are derivational and not obligatory  cf. § 42, § 43. Gender and nominal
classification play little role in CAY, and its grammar focuses little on sex dis-
tinctions. Glosses for the third person are thus given for convenience as it, its
(for non-humans) or he, his, him (for humans), unless it is pragmatically ade-
quate to use she, her.    i) CAY distinguishes three numbers, i.e. singular (sg.), dual (du.), and plural
(pl.), and four persons, i.e. first (1), second (2), third (3), and reflexive-third
(3R), each in all of the three numbers. Use of duality is rapidly declining among
young speakers, which is one of the most obvious and remarkable decays in the
inflectional system of the language.
    The reflexive-third person, which occurs with possessed nominals and with
participial, connective, and appositional mood verbs (below), is triggered by the
third person subject (S/A) as the syntactic pivot of the main clause.",[166]
"
3.   Complex transitives correspond with the compound-verbal class used by Reed et
     al. (1977: 232237), Woodbury (1985), and Jacobson (1994: 322324; 1995) for
     CAY and the double transitives referred to by Fortescue (1984: 8485) for
     Greenlandic. They may not only be double, but actually be triple (or more) in
     CAY, hence the term complex is preferred here to compound or double.
     They are, incidentally, neither serial verbs nor compound verbs (as stem com-
     pounding) in other languages nor complex transitives in English (Quirk et al.
     1985).
92 Morphological preliminaries   iv) Accordingly, the dynamic polysynthesis of CAY is colored by an exu-
berant internal syntax in which morphology may merge into the (external) syn-
tax and is characterized by its great width of morphosyntactic function in addi-
tion to semantic richness. While at one extreme a CAY word may contain no
more than a single morpheme (as is generally the case with typical isolating
languages), at the other it may be the functional equivalent of a complicated
sentence, embodying not only a good number of concepts of a more or less
concrete order, but also various grammatical functions, thereby yielding a very
heavy word that in most languages would be rendered by a long succession of
independent words.
   In sum, the richness of the CAY internal syntax most strongly reflects:   a. recursive suffixations
   b. transcategorial conversions
   c. cumulative multi-layered complex verbs.    v) Finally it is to be noted, as a matter of fact, that fluent speakers, typically
elders, are generally quite capable of using a variety of internally complicated
long words besides derivational elaborations, and this is done for stylistic or
aesthetic effects as well as for additions of grammatical/semantic and modal/
attitudinal subtleties. The capability to use many suffixes is likely to be taken as
a source of eloquence or verbal artistry (as manifested in speeches and in recit-
ing narratives and tales) for which a Yupik person is traditionally respected.
Speakers who are talented at polysynthetic word formation may sometimes
have fun competing with each other in creating very long words that are gram-
matically acceptable though rarely if ever used.
    Younger speakers in general, on the other hand, have much less of this poly-
synthetic capability. This is not surprising given the rapidly increasing influ-
ence of English with its analytical morphology and its consequently weakened
command of the traditionally rich and productive suffixes. The speakers make
particularly limited use of modal and attitudinal suffixes (§ 43), thereby render-
ing their speech short and straightforward, without cushions, and sounding
childish to elder speakers.","[143, 144]"
"   In the following pentavalent construction, two argument NPs are both with
the allative case:(154)     nere-vka-a-sqe-ssuk-aqa                        Nuka-mun(A"")
          eat-A'.make-EV-A''.ask-A'''.think-IND.1sg.3sg.p.n.-ALL.sg.
          arna-mun(A')          mikelnguqP=S(A)   nayir-mek(P).
          woman-ALL.sg.         child.ABS.sg.     seal-ABM.sg.
          I [A'""] think Nukaq asked the woman to let the child eat a seal.Here, nevertheless, the word order of the two -mun words helps avoid any pos-
sible ambiguity as it bears a mirror image relation to the suffix order con-
                                      Nominalizations of complex transitives   1163cerned: i.e. Nuka-mun for asker/orderer preceding arna-mun for caus-
er/allower just opposite to the suffix -vka(r)-A' preceding the suffix -sqe- for
A"". See also Woodbury (1985c: 275).
    A periphrastic construction (§ 40.6, § 51.3) may be one of the devices to
avoid the ambiguity, but even a multi-layer construction with five arguments
may occur without much ambiguity or confusion if each party is explicit with a
free NP.
    It is true that such complexity as illustrated above can indeed be too confus-
ing to be properly understood by many speakers. But there are consultants who
testify that this degree of complexity is not in fact beyond the point of tolerance
and it may sometimes be used in daily contexts with no sense of unnaturalness.    iii) Five-layered constructions: A few consultants went further to supply me
with such six argument sentences as the following (i.e. bivalent agentive stem
nere- to eat with four VVcm). This is surely very confusing to many speakers
who are asked to interpret, unless each of the parties is expressed by independ-
ent nouns  except for the first person singular (I), which is marked in the verb
inflection:(155)     Maya-mun(A''') nere-vka-a-sqe-ssuk-ni-agka
          p.n.-ALL.sg. eat-A'.make-EV-A''.ask-A'''.think-A''''.say-IND.1sg.3du.

          nayir-mek(P)
          seal-ABM.sg.
          I [A''''] said Mayaq thought his wife asked the white man to let their
          two children eat a seal. [DW, MB]One of the consultants let it slip that the final -ssuk-ni- is more acceptable than
the reverse -ni-ssuke- (for what reason she says she knows), and also confessed
that a six-layered nere-vka-a-sqe-ssuk-ni-yuk- with another speculative (A"""")
added would be the limit.","[1214, 1215]"
"
2.1. Three word classes  nominals, verbs, non-inflecting words CAY words can reasonably be separated into three classes primarily in terms of
their construction, that is, inflection or its lack: nominals, verbs, and non-
inflecting words (further divided into particles and enclitics, § 53, § 54).
The term nominal is used to subsume nouns, demonstratives, personal
pronouns, numerals, and (part of) ignoratives (§ 11 through § 15), though
the last (Wierzbicka 1980) may not be now felicitous.
    Inflecting and non-inflecting words are distinguished according to whether a
word is completed by its inflection at the end or not. Inflecting word, nominals
and verb, are distinguished by different type of inflection.
    Of the three classes, the verb is naturally of central importance. It is a ver-
bum, i.e. the word of words in CAY grammar as well. A predicate verb is the
obligatory element of a clause, while a nominal (whether in the core or an
oblique or a peripheral function) and a particle are optional. Internally, nominals
may be less elaborate than verbs.
    CAY has no word classes like articles, adpositionals (prepositions, postposi-
tions), articles, conjunctions, cf. iii) below.    i) Nominals  are characterized by the inflectional categories of number
(singular, dual, plural; § 21), person (possessor  first, second, third, reflexive
third; § 22), and case (absolutive, relative; ablative-modalis, allative, locative,
perlative, equalis; § 23 through § 29). Single nominals may be subclassified
into:
    a. nouns  common, appositive, location, time, kinship, color, proper, and
        onomatopoeia; § 11
    b. demonstratives  nominal and adverbial; § 12
    c. personal pronouns; § 13
    d. numerals/quantifiers (including verbal ones); § 14
    e. some ignoratives (others being particles or verbs); § 15.
    Nominal phrases, relativizations (relative clauses) and nominalizations
(nominal clauses), which may take the place of single nominals in a syntactic
slot, are discussed in § 16 through § 18.
    A CAY participle, as a participium, participates in the character of
nominals and verbs. Characterized by the same markers (intransitive and transi-
tive), a nominal participle is nothing but one kind of relativization (§ 17.2), and
a verbal participle is a verb in the participial mood (§ 4.2.4-i, § 47).
                                                      Word and its constructions   99    ii) Verbs  are characterized by the inflectional categories of person (subject
and object; § 32) and mood (§ 46 through § 51). There are three kinds of prima-
ry stems in terms of valency, primary in the sense of being without valency
modification:
    a. intransitive 8     monovalent with S (§ 33); to die, to be small
    b. monotransitive bivalent           with P and A (§ 34)
           agentive type                 to eat [S=A]
           patientive type               to break [S=P]
           impersonal patientive type to freeze [S=P, with A IMP it]
    c. ditransitive       trivalent      with T [theme], R [recipient], and A (§ 35)
            secundative type             to give someone (something)
            indirective type             to give something (to someone).
    These different types of verb stems are minimally illustrated in § 5(3) and (4).
    Impersonal A (AIMP) is coded in transitive inflection (as the third person sin-
gular subject), forming a transimpersonal construction (Haas 1940;
Malchukov 2008), but it cannot be externally expressed by a free NP (§ 34.3).
    Primary stems may be subject to valency modification by means of valency-
modifying suffixes (VVsm and VVcm; § 4.2.5.1, § 39, § 40), thereby increas-
ing, decreasing, or rearranging one argument.
    When stems (primary or modified) are inflected, they can be either of the
following (§ 32.1.2):
    a. intransitive verbs          with subject marked
    b. transitive verbs            with subject and object markedTransitive verbs may be detransitivized into antipassive, medio-passive, reflex-
ive or reciprocal, e.g. § 5(4), depending upon how the argument reduction is
made  see § 5.1.1.1-i and § 34.1 through § 34.4 for details. 9
    CAY is considered not to have the so-called copula. Copula-like or
equational verbs (like A is [his]B) in CAY, which are not necessarily intransi-
tive but may indeed be transitive, are referred to as relational verbs 10  see
§ 5.1.1.3-i and § 37. A parallel distinction between intransitive and transitive is
also made for comparative verbs (like A is bigger than [his] B)  § 5.1.1.3-ii,
§ 45.1, § 45.2. Besides intransitive vs. transitive, CAY relational and compara-
tive verbs manifest contrast between stative and inchoative (§ 37.3, § 37.4).   iii) Non-inflecting words  consist of multisyllabic particles and monosyl-
labic enclitics, prosodically distinguished from each other (though some dialects8.  Intransitives include predicative adjectives.
9.  CAY antipassivizers, it will be found, are originally a function of adversative
    (and benefactive) suffixes as a kind of applicative verbs.  § 39.5.2.

    an literature since Bloomfield (1928), cf. also Junker (2003).
100 Morphological preliminarieshave one exception in this distinction) (§ 52 through § 54). They are devoid of
inflection by definition and of productive derivation, though some show traces
of obsolete derivation and inflection. While these words may be semantically/
functionally vague, many of them serve as lubricants in utterances and have
no formal cues to classify them. A tentative grouping may, however, include:
    a. interjective/exclamative
    b. sentence word
    c. sentence-adverbial (modal, expressive)
    d. adverbial
    e. conjunctional (coordinating)
    f. discoursive
    d. sentence fillers (expletive).
    While particles are a semi-closed class, enclitics are a small closed class
(with a membership of about a dozen). Enclitics are words that always lean
phonologically upon the preceding host word, forming an enclitic bound phrase
together with it. They are clearly distinct from suffixes, which can only be (ar-
ticulated as) a part of a word. An enclitic as a word can attach to any kind of
word (verb, nominal, non-inflecting), while suffixes attach only to a specific
type of (expanded) stem, forming nothing but a part of a word.
    Most CAY enclitics are attached to a clause-initial word, i.e. as a second-
position enclitic (Wackernagels Law)  cf. § 54. An enclitic may be followed
by another, though three (or four) enclitics in succession would seem to be the
limit.
    No enclitics are known to have derived from free words. Personal pronouns,
which may form bound phrases with another word, are not enclitics, however.
    Particles have no inflection and are not stems but complete words by them-
selves. Nevertheless, as mention in § 4.1.3.2, some suffixes can be added, as if
postinflectionally, to some kinds of particles.    iv) Three word classes, each with wide functional coverage  As the demar-
cation between enclitics and suffixes (whether derivational or inflectional) is
rigid, so is that between nominals, verbs, and non-inflecting words. There are a
few kinds of verbs, namely connective mood verbs (§ 50), however, which
may be considered a transitional stage from nominals in view of case marking,
although some speakers prefer corresponding nominal phrases to the connective
mood verbs used by some speakers.
    As a consequence of the (only) three word classes, each covers a wider func-
tional range than, say, each of the traditionally held eight parts of speech.
CAY has no morphologically distinct word classes such as adjectives or ad-
verbs per se, although appositive nouns (§ 11.1) are adjectival in function and
many particles are adverbial. (Another choice for appositive nouns would be
adjectives, but the term appositive, which is used for phrases as well
[§ 4.1.4, § 16.1], is preferred to.) A considerable portion of (monovalent) verb
                                                    Word and its constructions   101stems would function as predicative adjectives in other languages. One cannot
identify adjectives in CAY by such a property as being a parameter of compari-
son. 11
    Adjective-like and adverb-like functions are also served by a large number
of productive suffixes besides three particular word class types. The function of
attributive adjectives is served by nominal-elaborating suffixes (NN type;
§ 20.1) as well, of which the language has a rather large stock, attributive
nominals in G function within attributive nominal phrases (§ 16.4), and relative
clauses (§ 17). On the other hand, the function of the so-called adverbs is
served by many verb-elaborating suffixes (VVa; § 41), various particles
(§ 53.4), and connective mood verbs (§ 50).
    Adpositional function (prepositions or postpositions) is largely performed
by person-inflected location noun (§ 11.2.2), with the dependent noun designat-
ing the relative position (spatial and temporal).
    There are, moreover, a number of non-inflecting words of conjunctional na-
ture (§ 53.5), which are, however, generally coordinating conjunctions. CAY
seems to have poor development of subordinating conjunctions, which is clearly
correlated with the fact that the clausal dependency is largely handled by an
abundance of subordinate clauses (with connective-mood verbs) and
cosubordinate clauses (terminology used by Van Valin and LaPolla 1997;
with appositional mood verbs; § 51-i) and by two kinds of converbs
(§ 47.6).
    In CAY, which has no articles as a separate class, the rich system of nomi-
nal demonstratives (§ 12.2) functions like definite articles, and the definite-
indefinite distinction of P/T/R argument is negatively implied by the assigned
case marking of the absolutive case vs. oblique (demoted) cases (i.e. ablative-
modalis or allative  § 25.2.1, § 26.2).","[150, 151, 152, 153]"

796 Locative case6. ExclamativeA locative-case NP may commonly be used for an addressee in argument-less
exclamations (§ 5.3.3-i), an exclamative construction that consists of a verb
particlized by the exclamative suffix VPc |+ 1paa| (which does not inflect) and
the enclitic |=li| often attached to the sentence-initial word (§ 54.2-iv). Since
such an exclamative form is morphologically not a verb but a particle (with no
person inflection), the addressee of the exclamation cannot reasonably be ex-
pressed by an absolutive-case NP and is instead expressed by an oblique one
(the locative). See § 52.4.1 for more examples with the VPc |+ 1paa|.
   The following vocative sentence is from the intransitive construction, which
has an absolutive-case NP as the S argument (the weather):(62)        Akerte-mi=lli          puqlanir-paa! ~ Puqlanir-paa=lli akerte-mi!

            sentence-initial word:
        cf. AkertaS           puqlanir-tuq.    The sun is warm.

yuina-a-t yuina-a-t 400 (20×20), is attested in (52b) and § 16 (68).

hough the position of the two words in the order above is apparently more
common than the opposite (the permutated malru-k yuin-a-k and others are also
possible). The sign 䍓 as in A 䍓 B is conventionally used to mean that both or-
ders A B and B A are possible. Non-permutability is indicated by *䍓 (§ 14.3.3).
   Likewise, the number |qulѠ-| ten may form 20, 30,  by multiplication
(10×2, 3, ...), though these are rarely used as numerals:

3.1. Questions  content, polar, alternative, echo, indefinite, indirectThere are two major types of interrogative sentences: (a) content or informa-
tional questions (as with a wh- word) and (b) polar (yes-no) questions, each
with subtypes. Both typically have a sentence-final falling tone.    i) Content questions: A content question is a request for information that the
speaker expects can or will be supplied by the addressee. It requires an
ignorative word or phrase (nominal or verb; see § 15.2 for six ignorative prima-
ry stems  what, who, where, when, how, how many) and a predicate verb
occurs in the interrogative mood (§ 48.2), as opposed to a polar question in ii)
below.
    The ignorative word or phrase typically comes at the beginning of a sen-
tence, though it can occur later in the sentence as well.
    One question may contain two ignorative words conjoined by the enclitic
|=Ѥu| and as in (49) and (50).
    The verb used in a response (a, b) in the following question (32) is not nec-
essarily in the indicative mood as in (a) but is more frequently in the participial
as in (b), which is more reactive or responsive and is typically accompanied by
the reactive enclitic |=wa| (§ 54.1):(32)      Ki-naS                 tekit-a?
          who-ABS.sg.            arrive-INT.3sg.

          Nukaq arrived.The focus Nukaq for the question by ki-na may stand word-initially or not.
    Ignorative words in content questions may either be a particle (how), an in-
flected adverbial adjunct (why, when, where), or a core or demoted argu-
ment (what, who[m], which). Not only intransitive S and monotransitive P
and A, but any ditransitive T, R, or A can be questioned by an ignorative word
and the interrogative-mood verb (as illustrated in § 48.2)  cf. § 35.2.4 for ques-
168 Syntactical preliminariestions of ditransitive verbs. Content questions are more fully illustrated with
ignorative words (§ 15.2) and interrogative mood verbs (§ 48.2).
   Verbs of other moods than the interrogative, however, may also be used to
form content questions, see, e.g. § 47.2 for a participial-mood verb particularly
with the particle |ima| you know.
    ii) Polar questions: A polar question, in contrast with the content question
just above, does not occur with an interrogative-mood verb and is characterized
by the rhetorical question particle |qaa| (§ 53.2; instead of an ignorative word). 9
This |qaa| as a particle may occur independently as a free word meaning (is
that) right?  see (38b) for confirmation. But it is typically attached like an
enclitic to the sentence-initial word (except for vocative and interjective words),
nevertheless forming a non-HQFOLWLF ERXQG SKUDVH DV LQGLFDWHG E\  EHORZ
(which triggers a pre-boundary regressive accent, unlike an enclitic =).
    Depending upon which constituent is the focus of the polar question, (33)
has different constituent orders. Typically the particle is attached to the word
initial word, forming bound phrases /nùk|kàqqaa/ and /tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tùq|qaa/ with the
regressive accent on the final syllable of the first word:
(33) a. Nùkàq  qaa       tekit-uq?         Has Nukaq arrived?
        p.n.ABS.sg.QST arrive-IND.3sg.
     b. Tekít-ùq  qaa           Nukaq      Has Nukaq arrived?
        arrive-IND.3sg.QST      p.n.ABS.sg.
 thereby showing that the questioning qaa is not an enclitic. Compare with
enclitic bound phrases Nukaq=llu /nùk|kaq|ܾu/ Nukaq also and tekituq=llu
/tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tuq|ܾu/ and he arrived with no regressive accent (*/nùk|kàqܾu/,
*/tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tùq|ܾu/).
    A ditransitive verb in polar questions is shown by:
(34)         Arna-mA  TDD       cikir-aa         angunR
             woman.REL.sg.QST give-IND.3sg.3sg.man.ABS.sg.

             Did the woman give the man ice cream? Is it the woman who gave
             the man ice cream?9.     It is interesting to note that the distinction in verb mood that CAY makes between
       polar questions (marked by |qaa|) and content questions does not obtain in its clos-
       est neighbors Central Siberian Yupik (CSY; Western Eskimo) and Iñupiaq (East-
       ern), where the interrogative mood is employed for either type of question, but that,
       among the neighboring languages, Yukaghir, an isolated Paleosiberian language,
       follows exactly the same pattern as CAY, with an interrogative mood and the same
       contrast between the two types of questions  see Krejnovich (1982: 150151) and
       Endo (1993: 8385).

    A response to an polar question typically occurs with the affirmative particle
|ii=i| /ií=i/ ~ /ii=í/ yes (35) 10 or the negative |qaaƾ| /qaáƾ/ ~ |qaƾƾa| /qàƾƾa/
no (36) 11 in the sentence-initial position, and if a verb accompanies (though
not obligatory), it is done reactively in the participial mood and with the in-
teractive enclitic |wa| or declaratively in the indicative mood:(35)       Ii=i,    tekite-llria=wa      /            tekit-uq.

calized:(14)       qane-llru-nrite-uq 䍦qane-nrit-llru-uq            he did not say.",[1265]
"    The phrase-internal word order of the absolutive R, the ablative-modalis (T),
and the appositional verb, as in (9), is the most typical, with little flexibility. But
insertion of, say, the question particle, is possible after the phrase-initial word in
the Wickernagel position, as in qula  TDD PDOUX-gnek cip-luku thirteen?,
implying that the clause is not a fixed bound phrase.
    For an appositional construction, such as (9a) qula malru-gnek cip-luku, a
shortened expression qula malru-gnek without the verb is heard at least as a
reply to a question asking for a number. The abbreviated appositional phrase
can be considered an adjunctional phrase (with the oblique malru-gnek; § 16.5),
but as a numeral it may not be well accepted by traditional speakers.
    See § 14.3.3 also for qula malruk 12 of (1c) type, which is a juxtaposed
phrase (§ 16.3).

4.   I have encountered, however, a few exceptional speakers in this respect, using the
     absolutive or the relative.
                                                          General characteristics   95   These (ii and iii) are two kinds of NPs that are relevant to animacy hierar-
chy by showing lack of morphological distinction between the absolutive and
the relative case. 5   iv) Verb inflections (for subject and object) employ both possessed nominal
person makers (absolutive and relative; § 20 and § 21) and verbal person mark-
ers (§ 32) in different combinations depending upon the moods. See also
§ 4.2.4-i and § 46.1 for partial identity of verbal and nominal inflections.
   The inflections of each mood show that the verbal person markers (listed in
Table 30) occur in the ergative pattern, e.g. first person singular |+ƾa| for S and
P arguments, as in pi-u-nga (do-IND-1sg.) I am doing and pi-a-v-nga (do-
IND-2sg.-1sg.) you (sg.) are doing to me, where -v- for A argument reflects
the nominal person marker in the relative case (cf. REL.2sg.sg. |+vѠt/+pѠt|).    v) By contrast, an NP in S or A function agrees in number with the subject
of the predicate but one in P, T or R with the object (§ 16, § 51, etc.), and the
reflexive third person (distinct from the third  see § 22.2, § 32.2) refers to the
subject, i.e. S or A argument of a main clause (§ 50-ii, § 51.1.4.2). Thus, syntac-
tically, CAY follows the nominative-accusative pattern.    vi) Lexical ergativity (Comrie 1978: 392) has to be mentioned in reference
to bivalent or monotransitive verb stems, a little more than a half of which are
agentive, with the rest being patientive. 6 The former are intrinsically agen-
tive (A=S; e.g. he ate it vs. he ate [something]), while the latter are patientive
(P=A; e.g. he broke it vs. it broke / was broken) and require suffixal anti-
passivization (traditionally called half-transitive in Eskimo linguistics, though
sometimes viewed as accusative; Kalmár 1979: 54) to be an agentive intransi-
tive; e.g. he broke-APS he broke [something])  see § 4.2.1-ii below and
§ 34.2 The latter patientives are ergative verbs.
    This fundamental bipartite feature of CAY bivalent stems permeates a num-
ber of important morphological and syntactical phenomena of the language (e.g.
topicalization, nominalization, relativization, nominal derivations, etc.).","[146, 147]"

3. Words, bound phrases, and phrases   i) A word may be a free/independent word 凑䪲媅 if it occurs as a single
form or articulus to be uttered in isolation without any other word being insert-
ed, while a language may have a clitic 媅, which is typically articulated in
phonetic dependence (i.e. clining) upon another word (host). 13
   A CAY free word is either mono- or multi-morphemic and may be subject to
a great extent and variety of suffixation, which is by far the predominant mor-
phological process in the language (§ 4.1.1). The language has no stem com-
pounding per se (despite the oft-expressed generalization that the process is a
universal feature of language), 14 though it has two specific types of what we call
phrasal compounds  e.g. (12) below.    ii) On the other hand, CAY has a limited number of monosyllabic words,
which are predominantly enclitics ∴ 媅 marked by = (equal sign) at the begin-
ning, as in (3), apart from one exceptional proclitic ⽳ 媅 or procliticized, as in
(15). A CAY enclitic is monosyllabic and monomorphemic. Though dependent,
it is still a word by itself with some independence and is utterly distinct either
from a suffix (derivational or inflectional) or a free word. The concept of a clit-
ic, so called in descriptions of many languages of the world, is known to be a
knotty problem in that the demarcation between an affix and a clitic may not be
as rigid, possibly being more or less gradual (cf. Nevis 2000: 392, Dixon and
13. Shiro Hattori once proposed three basic principles for rigidly distinguishing a
    bound (dependent) word from a free (independent) word (Hattori 1955: esp. 470
    479), while also distinguishing between a free form 凑䔘⽉⻶ and a bound form
    ếⱅ⽉⻶  note that his form is totally distinct from mine, however (§ 2.1).
14. E.g. Asher (1994: 5.25532554), despite Sapir (1921: 68) and § 4.3 also.
                                            Words, bound phrases, and phrases   27Aikhenvald 2002: 2527, Terasaki 2004: 43). But, as stated above, this is hardly
the case with CAY where the demarcation is generally clear (with a few cave-
ats), and suffixal morphemes are never cliticized (or realized as enclitics) while
enclitics never become suffixes. A CAY enclitic may be followed by one or
more enclitics, still forming a single articulus (as much as four enclitics in suc-
cession attested). CAY enclitics (of which there are only about a dozen; § 54)
are inflectionless, as is typically the case across languages of the world (though
there are languages which have inflectable clitics  cf. Nevis 2000: 394).    iii) Other morphosyntactic units or articuli immediately beyond the word
(either free or clitic) also seem to remain a matter of controversy. Descriptions
of many languages, well-known or exotic, seem to show that the categories
word and phrase may not be strictly binary, but to suggest (at least) another
level of articulation  variously interpreted and named  which is intermediate
in formal cohesiveness between words and phrases, each possibly with its defin-
ing features.
    There are some phonological features beside the form-defining (potential)
pause and insertability (§ 2.2.4) which distinguish a word from one or more
higher levels of articulations. In CAY there are a number of phonological ad-
justments, both segmental and prosodic, which may conspire to clearly distin-
guish a free word from the two kinds of bound phrase  enclitic and non-
enclitic (§ 2.3.1)  and a free word from a (free or syntactic) phrase (§ 2.2.1). A
bound phrase, consisting of two (or more) words, forms a single articulus, just
like a word, that has no internal (potential) pause, as amply illustrated in the
phonology chapters (§ 7 through § 9).
    Important references on the word in Eskimo languages would be Sadock
(1980, etc.), de Reuse (1994), and Woodbury (2002) among others.","[78, 79]"

Personal pronouns in CAY, as given in Table 9 (with person category indexed
in inflections, i.e. inflectional suffixes, at the end), are free words and refer only
to humans as a subject and object for verbs (§ 32), as well as a possessor for
nouns (§ 22). Though the language is very sensitive to (dis)honorifics or attitu-
dinal expressions (§ 6.2, § 20.3), it has no politeness distinction as far as per-
sonal pronouns and inflectional persons are concerned.","[433, 434]"
"* ELLA and QNMC contain short Notes to the Stories (359378 and 594625 respec-

written by the late Irene Reed, though not explicitly acknowledged as such in either
book.

1. A word as a formThe word weighs heavily in the grammar of CAY (and other Eskimo lan-
guages, for that matter), perhaps much more than those of a majority of the
worlds languages, though the word would be a fundamental and inevitable
entity in any human language, either an isolating language as Classical Chinese
or a polysynthetic one like Eskimo. This would be a necessary consequence
of converting thought or feeling into speech sounds in a human language, with
all its pre-linguistic, i.e. physiological and psychological, limitations and con-
straints.
    I fully agree with the standpoint expressed by the late Rokuro Kono 㲚憵⅔悵
(19121998) 1 in prefacing the six-volume Sanseidoo Encyclopaedia of Linguis-
tics ᷰ䛨⟩姧媅⭍⤎待⅟ , in that the genuine object of linguistics is a word
(Kamei et al. [eds.] 19881896, 1: ii; [translation mine]). At the same time, I
must confess my great indebtedness to Edward Sapir who laconically described
a word as merely a form (1921: 33), and beneath whose passages, one may1.     R. Kono is regarded by the late Professor Chino Eiichi (18322002) in one of his
       numerous enlightening books of general linguistics (2002: 175229) as one of ten
       linguists who established the modern linguistics (incl. B. de Courtney, F. de Saus-
       sure, V. Mathesius, S. Karchevski, A. Martinet, I. Meshchaninov, E. Sapir,
       R. Jacobson, and A. Meillet) particularly in view of his deep insights in linguistics
       and established grammatology 㕮⬾媽 (not 㕮⬾⭍), cf. lexigraphism 塏媅『 of writ-
       ing (§ 2.5-ii)
                                                                A word as a form 19
infallibly detect the echo of the words of Benedetto Croce (18661952), who
claimed that linguistics is nothing other than the Aesthetic (estetica as investi-
gation of a fundamental capacity of human beings) and that aesthetic activity is
    a matter of giving form, and nothing other than a matter of giving form
([1902] 1992: 156, 17).   i) Polysynthesis has been a highly important feature in the typological char-
acterization of Eskimo, 2 although linguists have not necessarily reached a con-
sensus on precisely what type of language it refers to (see e.g. Fortescue 1994b,
Baker 1996, Evans and Sasse 2002, Matissen 2004, Mahieu and Tersis eds.
2009, etc.). 3    Fully aware of the messiness of the problem, which may derive from the ac-
tual arbitrariness in what one deems to be a word, for one thing, and also from
its long-standing confusion of polysynthesis with the concept of incorpora-2.   The term polysynthesis was applied to Greenlandic Eskimo at least as early as the
     Danish Eskimologist WilliamThalbitzer (1911: 1057).
3.   The term itself was first used most probably by the French philosopher and lin-
     guist, and president of the American Philosophical Society, Peter S. DuPonceau
     (17601844) in an account of linguistic typology in his correspondence (July 31
     and August 30, 1816) with the Moravian minister John Gottlieb E. Heckewelder
     (17431823; [1819] 1876: 390392, 416) about the Delaware Algonquian gram-
     mar written by the latters predecessor David Zeisberger (17211808)  see
     Miyaoka (2002: 55). DuPonceau, who built on the emphasis laid on linguistic
     study by Thomas Jefferson, his predecessor at the Society, while influenced by
     Wilhelm von Humboldt (cf. fn. 4), was well-versed in American Indian languages
     and well-read in the linguistics of the time, as was Heckewelder. DuPonceaus first
     use of the philological term polysynthetic as early as 1816 precedes the first OED
     citation of the term from 1821 Southey. His definition ...des langues qui com-
     prennent le plus grand nombre didées dans le plus petit nombre de mots possible
     (DuPonceau [1835] 1938a: 89) reminds substantially of the same as Greenbergs
     quantitative index of morphemes per word (Greenberg [1954] 1960). Thalbitzer,
     once writing on Eskimo as a linguistic type (1930: 898), summed up the words of
     two parallel texts, one hundred Greenland words were, on an average, translated
     by six hundred sixty-six English words, this being the shortest translation possible,
     if every significant element of the Greenland words were to be accounted for.
        DuPonceau's set of five linguistic types (exposed in the same letter of July 31,
     1816, and found in the first edition of Encyclopaedia Americana, vol. 10, 1832:
     82)  i.e. asyntactic, analytic[al], synthetic[al], mixed, and syntactic or polysyn-
     thetic  which may have attracted more attention in North America than in Europe,
     is elaborate enough and at least comparable to the notable classifications by fa-
     mous European erudites of the day  cf. Miyaoka (1992b: 10261028). Incidental-
     ly, there is another important reason why DuPonceau is mentioned here, as it con-
     cerns the very nature of words see § 2.5-ii (lexigraphism).
20 A word in Yupiktion, 4 the term polysynthesis is employed here as a purely morphological pro-
cess notably in the Sapir-Greenberg-Mithun tradition, referring to the high de-
gree of synthesis of a word (morphemes per word), irrespective of the morpho-
logical processes employed in each language and not counting clitics. Noun
incorporation, the use of which I refrain in my work (§ 4.1.1-i), is employed in
recent Eskimo linguistics, e.g. by Sadock (1980, 2003) for Greenlandic, roughly
covering verbalizing (denominal) derivations (§ 4.2.5.1-i, § 37, § 38). See,
however, nominal stranding (§ 4.2.5.5.2-i, § 25.2.2-i) and discharging 㔥⇡
(Kono 1989: 1582, 1996: 1298) which is basically a process contrary to noun
incorporation in its wide sense.
   In § 2.4, minimum illustrations are provided to give some preparatory idea
of GCAY words and other larger units employed, i.e. two kinds of bound
phrases (§ 3.1).    ii) Modern linguistics owes the concept of double articulation to André
Martinet (1949), a feature which, no one would disagree, is the very source for
the economy and productivity of a human language, and without which a lan-
guage would be a tool unusable for its purpose (Hjelmslev [1943] 1953: 29). 5
The term articulation itself, however, is bivalent  both dividing and joint-
ing together (Oxford English Dictionary; OED). While Martinet double ar-
ticulation (into morphemes [monèmes] and into phonemes Ă ṳ憴⇭䮧) 6 is based
on the first sense, the term is used in the second sense of bilateral articulation
(ṳ杉䴷䮧; § 2.2, Miyaoka 2002) as a speech process of linearization. Cf. Sapirs
use in  unifying accent. But stress has done more than articulate or unify
4.   As is well known, Wilhelm von Humboldt (cf. fn. 3), using information about
     North American languages received from DuPonceau, proposed the concept of in-
     corporation (Einverleibung) in Classical Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan, Middle America)
     in 1836 (Humboldt 1971, 1994). Heymann Steinthal at least, who looked upon
     himself as the successor to Humboldt, referred the Eskimo (and Mexican) lan-
     guages to the Humboldts Einverleibung type (1893: 135154 [and 112134]). Its
     unfortunate and notorious confusion with polysynthesis continued throughout the
     rest of the nineteenth century, and it was left to Sapir to make a sharp distinction
     between polysynthesis and noun incorporation as a kind of N+V stem compound-
     ing (1911a but, notably, not 1911b)  see Mithun (1984) on incorporation and
     § 41.2-i for its lack in Eskimo. Furthermore, the confusion seems now to be com-
     pounded by a basically different school of linguistics.
5.   Martinet, while repeatedly discussing the disparity between a monème as the min-
     imal sign and a mot (placed in quotes) in defining double articulation (1960:
     112113, 1965), has not assigned a place to the latter but apparently discarded it
     instead (1960: 102109; Matthews 2001: 88).
6.   Japanese terms in kanji 㼉⬾ are added when they may suggest helpful hints about
     the basic concepts concerned.

hough the direction may sound opposite (top down vs. bottom up), the two ar-
ticulations would not simply be the opposite sides of the same coin. 7 It is not a
coin-like bilateralism.   iii) A form ⽉  or articulus 䮧 in bilateral articulation as understood here
 is a realization or embodiment of one or more pre-formal but categorized
abstract units (cf. -emes from Martinets first and second articulation, i.e.
morphemes and phonemes) according to predetermined grooves (Sapir 1921:
passim) or collective patterns ❲ unique to the language concerned. 8
2. Bilateral articulationThat a linguistic sign has two terms, sign-content and sign-expression, implies
that there are two articulations that are necessarily paired with each other,
namely, morpho-syntactic articulation on the content plane and the phonologi-
cal articulation on the expression plane. 9 Each articulation should be a bottom-
up dynamic process, implying that a phrase, clause, and sentence formation is
also a matter of articulation, just like word formation.","[69, 70, 71, 72, 73]"
