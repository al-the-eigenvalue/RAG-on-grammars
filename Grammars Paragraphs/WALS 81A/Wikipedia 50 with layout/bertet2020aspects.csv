"   It is unclear whether an unmarked order of main constituents (or Basic Word
Order) can be detected in smat from a pragmatic perspective. Only the relative
ordering of the subject (S) and the object (O) is constrained in (rare) cases where
both of them are expressed as nominal phrases and occur before the predicative
phrase (V) (✓ SOV, not *OSV). Apart from *OSV, however, all possible orders occur
in apparently any type of clause (in slightly varying morphosyntactic structures)
without, in most cases, one of them being clearly identifiable as less marked than
the others pragmatically. From a strictly morphosyntactic perspective, however,
the order S(O)V can be considered as the least marked insofar as it is the one that
requires the least morphosyntactic material.",[56]
"   Complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ may complement an extremely di-
verse range of predicative phrases involving notions such as utterance (‘say that …,
ask what …, etc.’), cognition (‘know that …, think that …, etc.’), perception (‘see
that …, hear that …, etc.’), emotion (‘be afraid to …, enjoy doing, etc.’), volitive
modality (‘want to …, order to …, etc.’), or phasal aspect (‘continue to …, finish
doing, etc.’), among others.
(iii) Uses not related to clause type. Clauses in sbjv-ʼü̃́ are involved as
components of the cleft sentences that constitute the strategy used for focalizing
constituents other than subject and (core) object arguments (on the strategy ap-
plied for focalizing subject and (core) object arguments, see Section 5.2.5 above).
Constituents with any syntactic function (e.g. comitative in example (498), punc-
tual locative in (499), manner in (491) above) and of any syntactic complexity
(whether a simplex or complex NP as in (498–499) or a full dependent clause as in
(500), repeated from (426 above)) may be focalized via this strategy.",[431]

ditions.","[433, 434]"

         [jsg B264–265]This strong ordering tendency, combined with the fact that the deictic verb cannot
bear indexes for syntactic functions other than subject, regularly leads to the other-
wise relatively unusual presence of main constituents bearing case-marking (in this

     Note that the linker regularly introduces such postposed subjects, as they have necessarily
already been referred to within the clause through the encoding of the subject argument included
in the inflected deictic verb. By contrast, complements in the accusative post-posed to the deictic
verb are usually not introduced by the linker, as they are then being referred to for the first time
within the clause (they cannot have been already referred to through indexation on the inflected
deictic verb, in particular). On the syntactic distribution of the linker, see Section 3.5.",[512]

1. Introduction
boring morphemes in order to be realized (excepting cases involving the consonant
/ʔ/). The correspondence between the shape of morphemes and their function (i.e.,
from the practical perspective of the analyst, the identification of morphemes) is
relatively straightforward in most domains of the morphological system of the lan-
guage, except in the complex inflectional morphology of the finite predicative
phrase, due to extensive fusion, syncretism, and homophony between unrelated
morphemes in this domain.    smat nouns are morphologically distributed in independent nouns (stressed
free forms) and bound nouns (unstressed bound forms). The language features five
nominal classes. Agreement for nominal class, which manifests itself throughout
the nominal phrase and in the indexation of participants within the predicative
phrase, is obligatory. The assignment of participants to a given nominal class in
discourse, however, is flexible even within a single speech event and depends in
complex ways on lexical, semantic, and pragmatic criteria. Nominal phrases in
subject and object syntactic function are left unmarked (i.e. occur in the zero-
case). By contrast, non-core syntactic functions are encoded, in most cases, by
means of a rich system of case-marking suffixes and relational nouns that are
attached to the nominal phrase. This tendency to dependent-marking coexists with
an opposite tendency to head-marking in cases where a nominal phrase comes after
(instead of before) the predicative phrase, in which case its syntactic function is
preferably marked through indexation within the predicative phrase (in cases where
indexes are available for participants in the corresponding syntactic function) and
the nominal phrase itself is left unmarked for syntactic function.    smat completely lacks a class of adjectives. Modification of nominal phrases
typically realized by means of adjectives in other languages is regularly realized
in smat by the subject relativization of stative predicative phrases. The language
does possess, by contrast, a reduced class of adverbs, whose single function is to
directly modify the predicative phrase.","[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]"
"     On the other hand, the ind vs sbjv-ʼü̃́ contrast is typically deactivated in
ordinary conversation with reference to recent past, present, or future processes,
i.e. any time the processes referred to are tightly related to the utterance situation
and their temporal order is deemed irrelevant or contextually obvious. Predicative
phrases in declarative main clauses then tend to all be inflected in ind. Ind is
also virtually systematic in non-temporally-ordered descriptions of events, e.g. in a
description of the various activities one carries out or may carry out (in any order)
on a given occasion or more generally in one’s daily life. Crucially, ind is also the
default Inflectional Type for predicative phrases in declarative main clauses
elicited from speakers out of context.",[407]
"    I have not investigated in a systematic fashion the relative ordering of the suf-
fixes indiscriminately analyzed here as belonging to the derivational morphology
of the PP. This morphological domain clearly features some ordering variation,
especially as far as the relative position of the plural suffix /-gǘ/ is concerned (see
e.g. the attested orderings /-èchà-gǘ/∼/-gǘ-èchà/ and /-chi ̀gǜ-gǘ/∼/-gǘ-chi ̀gǜ/ in
cases where /-gǘ/ co-occurs with the persistive /-èchà/ and the singular distributive
/-chi ̀gǜ/, respectively). Strong ordering tendencies can also be observed, how-
ever, including regarding the relative position of /-gǘ/ ‘pl’. For instance, /-gǘ/
virtually always comes after the intransitive plural suffix /-ē/ when both co-occur
within the same PP, yielding in most cases the immediate sequence /-ē-gǘ/. It is
likely that a thorough examination of all cases of co-occurrences of derivational
suffixes of the PP in a smat corpus would uncover more ordering tendencies or
constraints of the kind just mentioned. Certain ordering variations might also be
revealed to be regularly meaningful. In any case, note, importantly, that in Sec-
tion 4.4, where these morphemes are dealt with, they are grouped according to

general semantic criteria rather than following a hypothetical morphological
template that might underlie their organization. The presentational order of Sec-
tion 4.4 should therefore not be interpreted as corresponding to any underlying
morphological organization of the suffixes under discussion.","[291, 292]"
"    The non-verbal PPs formed in this way may usually be analyzed as possessive
non-verbal PPs in /-ã/̰ ‘poss’ (on which see the previous section) that addition-
ally feature possessee incorporation involving a bound noun having the seman-
tic role of the subject (on possessee incorporation, see Section 4.2.5.2, p.323).
Thus, the meaning of /tá=ná-ya̋e ̄-pǜtà/ (3s.sbj=3n/ns-hair-tooth) ‘he had his
teeth that had hairs’ in example (366) could probably be equivalently expressed
as ? /tü̂-mà-pǜtà ná=ná-ya̋e-̄ ã/̰ (3s-anaph-tooth 3m/n/ns.sbj=3n/ns-hair-poss)
‘his teeth had hairs’, i.e. rephrased using possessive predication in /-ã/̰ ‘poss’ with
the initially incorporated bound noun /-pǜtà/ ‘tooth’ moved to the syntactic posi-
tion of subject.240(366)                                                ̃́

                              5.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
    As a caveat, let me make clear that the terms Indicative, Imperative, and Sub-
junctive used to refer to the three Inflectional Types are to be understood as little
more than practical, mnemonic labels. Although they are borrowed from the
terminological tradition related to the grammatical category of mood, these labels
are by no means intended to suggest that the categories referred to here as
Inflectional Types can be, beyond a first approximation, identified and ade-
quately described as moods. The functional distribution of ind, imp, and sbjv,
however, is vaguely reminiscent of that of the categories traditionally labeled as in-
dicative, imperative, and subjunctive “moods” in the Romance languages. Because
many readers will presumably be familiar with that somewhat arbitrary termino-
logical tradition, I have opted for applying it to smat’s Inflectional Types (rather
than arbitrarily labeling them as e.g. Inflectional Type 1, Inflectional Type 2, etc.)
with the practical purpose of making it easier for these readers to recognize and
distinguish them.","[402, 403, 404]"
"    As was noted above, the deictic verb is by far the most favored device resorted
to for introducing direct speech. Semantically more specific utterance verbs rarely
fulfill this function by themselves. It is therefore not rare for the deictic verb to
co-occur with a semantically more specific verb in what can be analyzed as
a unique case of serial-verb construction in the language. This construction
facilitates the use of semantically specific utterance verbs as (co-)introducers of
direct speech. In this construction, two finite predicative phrases featuring the
same subject and referring to the same event follow each other with no intonational
break. One of the two finite predicative phrases is the deictic verb (always inflected
in sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/). It is preceded by its endophoric target (e.g. a complete utterance in
direct speech), or occasionally followed by it, in cases where it occurs second of the
two finite predicative phrases. The other finite predicative phrase (which is, for
its part, freely inflected in any of the three Inflectional Types) refers lexically to a
specific type of uttering process (‘to say’, ‘to ask’, ‘to answer’, ‘to call’, ‘to rebuke’,
etc.). In most cases, the two predicative phrases involved in this construction are
arranged in the order just suggested:
        [target] deictic.verb.sbjv-ʼü̃́PP1 specific.uttering.processPP2
although the opposite ordering also occurs:
        specific.uttering.processPP1 deictic.verb.sbjv-ʼü̃́PP2 [target]
Examples (591) and (592) feature typical instances of this construction. Note that
the two finite predicative phrases in the construction under discussion may be sep-
arated by enclitics (such as /=ãʼ̄ a/ ‘quot’, which may occur between all sorts of
constituents in the language, and /=gá/ ‘pst’, which usually behaves as a second-
position clitic, in (591)) or by complements of the one that refers to a specific
uttering process (such as /tü̂-ʼü̃̄/ [3s-acc] ‘him’ in (592)).(591)        ́ ü!” ña̋tàgǜʼü̃́ ãʼ̄ a gá tíì-kà.

is anaphorically coreferential with the target and redundantly refers to the piece

4.2.5.2       Functional types   From a syntactic and semantic perspective, I distinguish three major types of
incorporation in smat: core argument incorporation, possessee incorporation,
and non-core participant incorporation.
    (i) Core argument incorporation In core argument incorporation, the
semantic role of the incorporated constituent corresponds to the semantic role of
the subject of an intransitive verb root/stem or the object of a transitive verb
root/stem. The subject syntactic position of the intransitive verb root/stem, or the
object syntactic position of the transitive verb root/stem, is “absorbed” by the in-
corporated constituent. Core argument incorporation consequently decreases the
valency of the verb root/stem: an intransitive one becomes avalent (rare), a tran-
sitive one becomes intransitive. Core argument incorporation mostly incorporates
bound nouns (instead of entire NPs, but see (335)).","[325, 326]"

6. The deictic verb
    The subject of the deictic verb is typically an animate referent, as in most
examples in this section, or less frequently a concrete, inanimate referent. But
it may also occasionally be an abstract entity, such as a speech, a story, a call,
a song, a thought, a person’s mind, etc. In such cases, the deictic verb does not,
strictly speaking, refer to a process (‘do thus’) being carried out by the subject. It can
rather be considered in practice as the equivalent of an equative verb, and functions
more specifically as a deictic equative verb (‘be thus’). Its specialized use is then
to introduce a linguistic, cognitive, or vocalic object that is being equated with
the subject. This is illustrated in example (618), where the ‘speaking’ (déʼà) that
is taking place is equated with, or defined as, the question enclosed in quotation
marks (see also example (594) below):(588)                                    ̃́ ñâʼü̃́ ãʼ̄ a, “<kù-...> tōkù-tàʼkùʼü?”

        were their words [lit. ‘... thus did their speaking.’].’ [lar C404–405]   In addition to a subject argument, the deictic verb may optionally take an ar-
gument marked for the accusative case (to be distinguished from a core object,
which does not bear any syntactic-function marking, as mentioned above) in cases
where it specifically refers to an uttering-process (i.e. a piece of linguistic discourse
actually spoken). The referent of that argument is the addressee of the uttering-
process mentioned by the speaker. This is illustrated at the end of example (582)
above. Note that such accusative arguments may only consist of explicit nps as they
cannot be indexed on the deictic verb.","[510, 511]"
"    However, in the speech of most speakers, sbjv-ʼü̃́ is regularly used in declara-
tive main clauses to present a process as constituting a new, salient step within
a temporal sequence of processes. sbjv-ʼü̃́ is then resorted to as a discursive de-
vice that allows the speaker to explicitly construct a clear temporal axis along which
major steps are grammatically signaled as such as they are being mentioned. Such
uses of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses could be roughly glossed by ‘at that
point, …’, as was done in the translation of example (448d) above. By contrast,
non-sequential processes, or minor sequential processes that the speaker does
not want to present as sequenced, are referred to with predicative phrases in ind.
In other words, predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ essentially correspond to those that
involve what I call advancement of narrative time ([+ant]), while predica-
tive phrases in ind essentially correspond to those that do not involve advance-
ment of narrative time ([-ant]). An important consequence is that predicative
phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses may not be uttered in a different
order without typically implying a different sequence for the processes referred to,
i.e. the ordering of [+ant] forms conditions the semantic interpretation of the
processes referred to. By contrast, predicative phrases in ind in declarative main
clauses may be uttered in a different order with no direct implication as to the se-
quence of the processes referred to, i.e. the ordering of [-ant] forms has no effect
on the semantic interpretation of the processes referred to. Note that the order-
ing of [-ant] forms does, by contrast, condition the discursive—more specifically,
the rhetorical—interpretation of utterances, as it obviously has direct effects on
the order in which the information is delivered and construed and the way it is
rhetorically organized.259
  259
      Thus in example (451) below, which contains three main clauses in ind, the enacted speaker
chooses to first make a more generic announcement (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) and then pro-
ceeds to make a more specific elaboration on it in the next two utterances (‘I’ll shoot some brown
woolly monkeys. I’ll go woolly-monkey-hunting.’). With the exact same semantic meaning, the
first utterance (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) could presumably have been uttered last, but then that
semantically more generic utterance would have been construed as a summary restatement of the
more specific announcement made in the previous two utterances, yielding a different rhetorical
structure from the one actually at play in (451). Likewise, in (450) below, the ordering of the three
clauses in ind in the answer (‘I’ve shot a beautiful tére̋ parrot, it has fallen down here but I can’t
find it.’) could in principle be altered (as in e.g. ‘A beautiful tére̋ parrot has fallen down here, but
I can’t find it, [in fact] I’ve shot it.’) with no consequences as to their semantic interpretation, but

                                    5.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
    Typical discourse genres where the ind vs sbjv-ʼü̃́ contrast is exploited are
narratives (whether set in a remote past and unrelated to the discourse partici-
pants—myths, legends, tales, etc.—or set in a relatively recent past and related to
the discourse participants—life stories, anecdotes, etc.) and procedural discourse
(cooking recipes, descriptions of craft techniques, chronologically-ordered descrip-
tions of the typical activities carried out in a given period of time, etc.). In these
discourse genres, while predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ are used to orderly unroll the
series of major events (or steps to be conducted), predicative phrases in ind are gen-
erally employed with one or several of the following six main discursive functions
(the simple illustrative contexts of use in parentheses are made up examples that
parallel actual occurrences in my corpus; actual examples are provided below):260    – locating a major event in space or time (e.g. ‘The next day came.ind. Then
      he went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ into the jungle.’);    – mentioning preliminary minor events (e.g. ‘He eventually spotted.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a
      monkey. He came closer.ind and he shot.sbjv-ʼü̃́ it.’);    – recapitulating a previous major event (e.g. ‘And then he came down.sbjv-ʼü̃́.
      So, he came down.ind, and then he started.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to speak.’);261
such alterations would affect the rhetorical relations that bind them into a small discourse unit.
In practice, in (450), the rhetorical principle that guides the ordering of the clauses in ind under
scrutiny is temporal iconicity, but the use of ind in these clauses indicates that establishing a clear
temporal axis is not essential to the purposes of the enacted speaker at that moment.
  260
     Interestingly, when they fulfill one of the first three functions in this list, main declarative
clauses containing a predicative phrase in ind are often explicitly topicalized by means of a topic
marker (/=i ̀/ ‘contr.top’ in non-past contexts or /=gá/ ‘pst’ in past contexts) attached at their
right edge (as in examples (454a) and (455e) below). This clause-level topicalization process could
in fact be argued to turn these clauses into near-dependent clauses (as opposed to genuinely inde-
pendent main clauses). Note further that all of the six functions in this list are somehow related to
topical (i.e. already known or backgrounded) information, as opposed to the more focal (i.e. un-
known or foregrounded) information typically conveyed by declarative main clauses containing a
predicative phrase in sbjv-ʼü̃́.
  261
      The use of such recapitulating clauses for discourse cohesion is frequent in narratives and proce-
dural discourse in smat. These recapitulating clauses are of two major formal and functional types.
Some include the predicative phrase of the recapitulated clause more or less verbatim (“recapitulat-
ing linkage” proper in Aikhenvald (2019)’s terminology). These verbatim (or specific) recapitulating
clauses typically provide linkage from one sentence to the next within a single paragraph and often
imply that the two main processes referred to are temporally close to each other (see e.g. exam-
ples (454a–454b) below). Other much more formulaic recapitulating clauses feature an anaphoric
word referring to the processes to be recapitulated (/ngē-mà/ ‘med.ns-anaph’ in past or non-past
                                                                                                   401
5. Inflection of the predicative phrase
    – initiating a series of major events (e.g. ‘Once upon a time, a man went.ind
      into the jungle. There he found.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a deer.’);    – elaborating on specific aspects of a major event occurring at the same ref-
      erence time (e.g. ‘And then they had.sbjv-ʼü̃́ dinner. They chatted.ind, they
      drank.ind [i.e. while eating]. Then they went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to bed.);    – describing participants of a major event (e.g. ‘The canoe was large.ind.’).","[405, 406, 407]"
"    Interestingly, whether the target of the deictic verb is a piece of discourse, a ges-
ture, an anaphoric, or a non-finite verb, its exact syntactic function cannot be es-
tablished with certainty. As a corollary, whether the deictic verb is morphosyn-
tactically intransitive or transitive appears to be an unanswerable question.
From a strictly morphosyntactic perspective, nothing definitively precludes from
analyzing the deictic verb’s target as a core object, since core objects in smat are
in the zero-case, i.e. are left morphologically unmarked for their syntactic function.
Thus, there is the possibility that the anaphoric ngēmà ‘that’ in example (585),
which stands in the zero-case, is indeed to be interpreted as the core object ar-
gument of the deictic verb. On the other hand, no language internal facts seem
to offer positive evidence for the analysis of the deictic verb’s target as its object.
Regular predicative phrases can be unequivocally told to be transitive or intransi-
tive depending on whether or not they require the indexation of a core object in
contexts where, all other things being equal, they are not preceded by any syn-
tactic NP (in the zero-case) that might function as their core object (thus fè ‘to
shoot’ in /kŏwǘ ná=fè/ [deer 3m/n/ns.sbj=shoot] ‘she/he shot the deer’ can be
definitively identified as a transitive verb because */ná=fè/ is not acceptable as
is with the meaning ‘he shot (it)’, which can only be conveyed by /ná=nā=fè/
[3m/n/ns.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=shoot], i.e. with the inclusion of an object index).
The inflectional paradigm of the deictic verb does not seem to display any marking
for object indexes, but this cannot be taken as definitive evidence for the verb’s
intransitive nature due to its morphological uniqueness in the language (see Sec-
tion 6.2). In principle, it might simply be that the deictic verb, although transitive,
has the unique morphological ability to occur without an object index in contexts
where it lacks an object NP preceding it. These considerations leave open the
question of the syntactic relationship, if any, that holds between the deictic
verb and its target in smat. This is why I have opted for labeling the target with
a syntactically neuter term, instead of referring to as e.g. a complement.",[510]

"    Before passing to the description of the various types of smat PPs and their
derivational morphology, a brief definitional notice is in order. Although the de-
scription of the inflectional morphology of the finite PP is deferred to the next
chapter, note, crucially, that it is what provides an operational criterion for defin-
ing what I simply refer to as a PP throughout the present chapter. I generally
define as a PP any phrase that may directly (i.e. without any morphological
modification) receive inflectional morphology of the finite PP.",[292]
"    Predicative phrases in smat can be verbal (i.e. based on a typically mono-
syllabic verb root) or non-verbal. Verb roots, which may receive inflectional
morphology of the finite predicative phrase as they stand, have access to a rich
paradigm of derivational suffixes most of which encode the nature of the spatial re-
lation that holds between a figure (the subject or object participant) and a ground
at the culminating phase of the process. They also frequently incorporate nominal
constituents. Both verbal and non-verbal predicative phrases may additionally re-
ceive one or several of a number of derivational suffixes encoding categories such
as Aktionsart, aspect, mood, intensity, or number, among others. The intricate50

inflectional morphology of the finite predicative phrase provides slots for the
indexation of subject and object arguments, as well as that of participants in the
accusative (a syntactic function distinct from that of (core) object), benefactive,
locative, and partitive object syntactic functions. The inflection of the predicative
phrase additionally encodes predicative class (an ultimately lexical feature of pred-
icative phrases, which are distributed in five predicative classes) and, optionally,
associated motion (i.e. the occurrence of a backgrounded motion event prior to
the main process). The encoding of tense is completely absent from the domain
of the predicative phrase. Tense is encoded instead within the nominal phrase
(“nominal tense”) or by means of clause-level enclitics.    smat can be broadly characterized as a nominative-accusative language. The
unique argument of intransitive predicative phrases (U) can indeed be said to align
with the agent argument of transitive predicative phrases (A, as opposed to its pa-
tient argument P) as far as the encoding of their syntactic function is concerned
(although this alignment can really only be observed in the indexation of these ar-
guments within the predicative phrase, but not if these arguments are expressed
as syntactically free nominal phrases, in which case nothing allows to tell how U,
A, and P—which are all left unmarked—align). Note, however, that the effect of
certain derivational suffixes of the verb root or the predicative phrase follows an
ergative-absolutive alignment (e.g. the plural allomorph of some of these suffixes
encodes the plurality of U or P, but never A).","[55, 56]"

    (ii) Possessee incorporation In possessee incorporation, the semantic role
of the incorporated constituent corresponds, like in core argument incorporation, to
the semantic role of the subject of an intransitive verb root/stem or the object
of a transitive verb root/stem. Possessee incorporation may also occasionally oc-
cur in cases where the semantic role of the incorporated constituent corresponds to
that of the complement in the accusative of an intransitive verb root/stem. How-
ever, unlike in core argument incorporation, no valency decrease occurs. The
subject, object, or accusative complement syntactic position—respectively—is not
absorbed by the incorporated constituent, but is instead occupied by a participant
that corresponds semantically to the possessor of the incorporated constituent.","[327, 328]"
"    The essential and most frequent function of the linker can be viewed as that
of introducing any NP that constitutes a syntactic expansion of a participant
already referred to within the clause, whether that participant was previously
referred to by means of a NP or by means of a pronominal index procliticized to
a finite predicative phrase. A straightforward illustration of the former case, i.e.
an instance of expansion of a participant previously referred to by means of
a NP, is given in example (223), where the noun nâi ‘tree’ is expanded by two
immediately subsequent relative clauses (each enclosed in square brackets). These
relative clauses, because they follow the first mention of the participant they are
elaborating on, must both be introduced by the linker (in its neuter inflectional
form specifically, given that the speaker is here assigning nâi ‘tree’ to the neuter
nominal class):(223)   wíʼá nâi yà táʼüc̋ hi ̄nè yà wôchi ̋nèmáʼa nà-ūgün

Example (224) features a slightly less straightforward illustration of the same type
of expansion (the expansion is again enclosed in brackets). In this example, by
contrast with the order featured in (223), the more head-like NP (i ̀ kōri ̋gǘ ‘White

a participant already mentioned within the clause by tògǘ, functions as an expan-
sion and must consequently include the linker. In other words, of several NPs
corresponding to a single participant within a single clause, it is always the
non-first ones that bear the linker, regardless of whether these non-first NPs are
more head- or more dependent-like relative to the NP that represents the first men-
tion of the participant within the clause. Note, thus, that the notion of expansion
as I define it here does not equal that of dependent or modifier. Note, additionally,
that certain modifiers, such as the indefinite determiner wi ́ʼá (as in (223)) and the
non-locative demonstratives (such as ngēmà in (224)), as well as genitive phrases
in general (i.e. NPs attached with the genitive case-marking suffix /-ãr̀ ǖ/), are di-
rectly preposed to the NP they modify, that is, they do not admit the presence
of the linker in front of that modified NP.223    Example (225) displays an occurrence of a NP (enclosed in brackets) functioning
as a syntactic expansion of a pronominal index. The NP yà tògūʼè ‘the other one’,
which makes it explicit whom the subject index /tá=/ ‘3s.sbj’ is referring to, must
include the linker, in this case in its salientive inflectional form (which in the speech
of many speakers happens to be homonymous with its neuter form):(225)    Mārǖ tá-yŭ yà tògūʼè.

  223speech of older speakers, and allows it, optionally, in the speech of younger speakers such as jgs

Complex case 1: indexation of a third person subject in slot 7 (fifth
and sixth rows in Charts J–M on pp.452–453). Third person f/m/n/ns
subjects in sbjv are encoded in slot 7, i.e. in the slot dedicated to the encoding of
third person m/n/ns (core) objects in ind, and their exponents are segmentally
(but not always tonologically) identical to those that encode third person
m/n/ns objects in ind.272 In other words, the morphological material occurring
in slot 7 in ind, although it happens to only serve for the encoding of third per-
son m/n/ns object indexes in ind (given that subjects are always indexed in slot 4
in ind),273 essentially encodes a third person f/m/n/ns index, whether subject or
object, which is why the exact same material is found to occur in sbjv for the en-
coding of third person f/m/n/ns subject indexes. Portmanteau proclitics in sbjv
that simultaneously encode a third person f/m/n/ns subject index in slot 7 together
with features from slots 5 (associated motion) or 6 (predicative class) are likewise
segmentally (but not always tonologically) identical to those that simultaneously
encode in ind a third person m/n/ns object index in slot 7 together with features
from slots 5 or 6. The reason why all these morphemes encoding a f/m/n/ns sub-
regular but more opaque /nà6+7 =ngǜ-gü̋-ʼü̃́/ [pcrǖ.3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=rest-pl\sbjv-sub] ‘they
rested’ (subscript numbers in these forms correspond to the slots filled by the respective morphemes;
for an instance of this phenomenon in context, see (T109)). I take such analogical forms as an indi-
cation that the system of encoding of third person f/m/n/ns subject indexes in sbjv proves opaque
to speakers themselves, to the point of prompting unconscious “repairs” from them.
  272
     This formal identity suffers a single exception. While the morpheme that simultaneously en-
codes pci ̀ and a third person m/n/ns object index in ind has the phonological form /yà=/, the
one that simultaneously encodes pci ̀ and a third person f/m/n/ns subject index in sbjv virtually
always takes the phonological form /yi ̀=/ (or even /yi ̰=/, instead of the expected /yà=/) in the
specific case where it is combined with the high-frequency verb root i ̃̊ ‘to be’ (yielding the predica-
tive phrase /yi ̀=i/̃̀ [pci ̀.3f/m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv=be\sbjv] ‘(that) he/she/it is’). For a similar case of
assimilation for vowel quality of an /a/ with the nucleus /i/ of i ̃̊ ‘to be’, see the case of the irregular
realization /i ̄yi ̀=/ of the proclitic /i ̄yà=/ ‘3f.sbj.pci ̀’ in Section 5.3.2.
  273
     Note, additionally, that the reason why the morphemes that fill slot 7 in ind never stand for
a third person f object but only for third person m/n/ns objects (while the same morphemes in
ind may stand for both third person m/n/ns and f subjects) is because third person f participants
in (core) object syntactic position are in practice always encoded, via a phenomenon of differential
object marking, as participants in the accusative. Such participants, when indexed on the predicative
phrase, systematically occupy slot 2 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase, and never
slot 7.",[447]

the cleft construction is not a relative clause but a subordinate clause in /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’
(on focalization implemented by means of cleft constructions involving subordinate
clauses in /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’, see Section 5.2.6, p.426). Because that subordinate clause
functions syntactically as the subject of the copular verb and follows it, it bears,
again, the linker.","[267, 268]"

to are not felt to require explicit temporal sequencing in order to be correctly in-
terpreted. This implies that ind is found in main clauses in a wide and largely
heterogeneous array of declarative contexts, which will be exemplified below.
In fact, in the speech of some speakers (e.g. igs), ind is pervasive in declarative
main clauses—regardless of the (ir)relevance of explicit temporal sequencing for
their interpretation—and only rarely contrasts with sbjv-ʼü̃́. For these speakers,                                                                                  399

4.2.5.1      Formal types    From a strictly morphological perspective, incorporation in smat corresponds
to two different constructions, bound noun incorporation and NP incorporation.
   (i) Bound noun incorporation Bound noun incorporation, a very fre-
quent construction, allows a bound noun (alone, i.e. without the stressed mor-
pheme or stem to which it would necessarily have been attached to occur as a free
syntactic constituent of the main clause in discourse) to be directly attached to
the right edge of a verb root or a verb stem. Because bound nouns are (invari-
ably) unstressed forms in smat, the resulting incorporating verb stem constitutes a
single phonological word.",[323]

                                    5.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
    The frequent and semantically vague adverbial clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ …
‘conj’ are roughly comparable to English gerundive clauses, hence the possibil-
ity of generally glossing them as ‘it being the case that …’. They may take a wide
array of circumstantial meanings and are often ambiguous. Their exact interpreta-
tion relies heavily on the linguistic and extra-linguistic context. Common possible
translations of these adverbial clauses in English include ‘when …, once …, while
…, as …, because …, although …’. These clauses may also occasionally bear no
clear semantic or discursive relation to their context (as in e.g. (T155)). The use
of the conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ to introduce them is not optional. The fol-
lowing two examples illustrate this type of adverbial clauses featuring predicative
phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́:(489)   Wâʼí náʼa consorciowa̋ chà-pūrāküʼ̋ ü̃́ rǜ mārǖ i ̋chā-ṹʼü̃̀ náwa̋.

            (sbjv-ʼü̃́) out of declarative main clauses
   This section deals with a particular use of sbjv, namely its extremely frequent
use in association with the subordinator /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’. Unsurprisingly, the com-
bination sbjv-ʼü̃́ occurs in complement and adverbial dependent clauses, and is
involved in cleft constructions that allow for the focalization of constituents that
are neither subjects nor (core) object arguments. More surprisingly, sbjv-ʼü̃́ also
occurs in main clauses as a result of a phenomenon of insubordination.",[426]
"      Especially noteworthy is the fact that the subject indexes of the verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+
-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’, when present, are for the most part encoded by means of suf-
fixes (/-chā/ ‘1sg.sbj’, /-kū/ ‘2sg.sbj’, etc., which follow the stressed syllable of the
phonological word they belong to) instead of the functionally equivalent procl-
itics featured by the inflectional paradigm of regular predicative phrases (/chā=/
‘1sg.sbj’, /kū=/ ‘2sg.sbj’, etc., which precede the stressed syllable of the phono-
logical word they belong to). Two inflectional forms of /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do
thus’ are even more exceptional: in /ngi ́-(rǖ)rǖgǜ/ ‘she does thus’ (ind) and /ngi ́[-
ʼǘ̃]/ ‘(that) she does thus’ (sbjv[/-ʼǘ̃/]), the exponent of the third person feminine
subject index, /ngi ́-/, is identical to the Allomorph 1 of the (stressed) pronominal
root /ngi ́-/ ‘3f’ (on the morphology of the pronominal roots, see Section 3.3.1).
Nowhere else in the inflectional paradigms of smat predicative phrases is the expo-
nent of a subject index a stressed syllable, nor more specifically a personal root.293   Moreover, unlike regular predicative phrases, the deictic verb does not allow for

     These two highly unexpected forms are unfortunately hard to interpret from a diachronic per-
spective. They could be analyzed as either inflectional fossils or late innovations.",[517]

4. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
Thus, in possessee incorporation, the syntactic valency of the verb root/stem re-
mains unchanged, but the mapping of its syntactic valency onto semantic roles is
reorganized. In the case of a transitive verb root/stem, for instance, the presence
of possessee incorporation implies that the participant in object position is not the
patient, but the possessor of the patient, which is itself expressed as the incorpo-
rated constituent. Possessee incorporation allows a semantic possessor to be
promoted to the syntactic position of its possessee and, as a result, to benefit
from an increase in discursive salience, in particular over its possessee. Like core
argument incorporation, possessee incorporation may yield relatively lexicalized
incorporating verb stems (involving an incorporated bound noun) denoting well-
identified concepts in the Tikuna culture, but it is generally much more flexible
and productive than core argument incorporation.","[328, 329]"
"    As shown in these tables, the values that can be encoded by the benefactive
participant index (slot 1), the accusative participant index (slot 2), and the subject

function), in which case it makes no distinction of nominal class, or it may stand
for a partitive object participant, in which case it differs whether it stands for a par-
ticipant in the masculine, neuter, or non-salientive nominal class (partitive objects
in the feminine or salientive nominal class can never, for their part, be indexed on
the predicative phrase). The third person index in slot 7, which may stand for a
subject or an object argument depending on the context, may only take the val-
ues masculine/neuter/non-salientive (m/n/ns) or feminine (f). Incidentally, this
implies that salientive (s) third person subject or object arguments can never be
indexed in slot 7 and that their indexation, in contexts where they would be in-
dexed in slot 7 if they belonged to another nominal class, therefore has to occur in
other slots (specifically in slot 4 in cases where they stand for a subject argument,
and—by a phenomenon of differential object marking—in slot 2 in cases where they
stand for an object argument, in which case they are encoded morphologically as
an accusative participant). The third person (masculine, neuter, or non-salientive)
object index in slot 8 is simply either present or absent. Likewise, the feature of
associated motion encoded in slot 5 is simply either present or absent. Finally, the
values encoded in slot 6 straightforwardly correspond to each of the five predica-
tive classes of the language (note that pcØ, by contrast with the other predicative
classes, is morphologically unmarked in most cases, and that in such cases I do not,
accordingly, state its presence explicitly in glosses).","[397, 398, 399]"

mentioned in this work together with their variants. Each entry provides the mor-
pheme class of the corresponding lexeme as well as the gloss (or glosses) that it
receives in this work, and occasionally a short comment. Bound morphemes whose
first syllable features a toneme /4 /, /3 /, or /C / are further characterized as being
either triggers ([+tr.]) or non-triggers ([-tr.]) of the Pattern 2 tonological alter-
nations (see Section 2.6.2.2). Lexemes that refer to particular living species are
additionally provided—on an indicative basis—with the binomial name of that (or
occasionally those) species (the mention “unidentified” appears in cases where I am
unable to provide a binomial identification).349 Note the following abbreviations:adv.      adverb                                       interj.    interjection

"   The likely or explicit realizations of the reflexes of today’s smat /ʨ/ and /ʥ/
recorded in all the existing pre-linguistic records of Tikuna and in the major lin-
guistic works on Tikuna are plotted in chronological order in Figures 19 and
20.164 The data in these figures lead me to hypothesize that a long-term process
  164
     Each name in Figures 19, 20, and 21 below is that of an individual who collected first-hand
data on a Tikuna variety. The names are placed at the approximate time of data collection (as op-
posed to the time of publication of the data; for more on the diagrammatic organization of these
figures, see Section 1.4). Below each name of individuals who produced linguistically-informed
records (i.e. after 1953) is a transcription in IPA of the phonetic realization reported or explicitly
described by the corresponding individual for a given phoneme. Below each name of individuals
who produced non-linguistically-informed records (i.e. before 1953) is an approximate transcrip-
tion in IPA of the phonetic realization(s) that the corresponding individual likely witnessed for a
given phoneme. My interpretation of these realizations is based on the transcription habits of each
individual, taking into account the orthographic tradition of his native language at the time of data
collection as well as his transcription habits for other languages of which he has left written records.
As shown in Figure 19, for instance, the identifiable reflexes of today’s smat /ʨ/ occurring in
Tikuna words collected between 1817 and 1820 by the German biologist Johann Baptist Ritter von
Spix (1781–1826) and published in Martius (1867:159–161, 413–486) can be interpreted as *[ɕ]
or a coronal fricative phone close to it. In an overwhelming majority of cases, these reflexes are
indeed transcribed <s> (up to 37 occurrences) or <sch> (up to 12 occurrences). The grapheme
<s> in Spix’ use most likely stands for [s] (compare his transcriptions for a Quechuan variety he
witnessed in Peruvian Amazonia: <uâsy> ‘house’ most likely for [ˈwasi], <ghosa> ‘husband’ for

weakly articulated onset at the time of borrowing, and to have developed an initial
[ŋ] at a later stage. Note, however, that most loanwords of comparatively old date
(e.g. loanwords from Old Omagua) whose source form lacks an initial onset do not
display an initial [ŋ] in today’s smat, but a /ʔ/ (see, e.g., (117a), (119f), and (121b)
above). It remains unclear why some loans from onsetless sources yielded Tikuna
forms with an initial phone that would later develop into [ŋ], while others yielded
Tikuna forms with an initial /ʔ/.","[165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170]"
"   The smat predicative classes are, as a first approximation, comparable to the
categories commonly referred to as “conjugations” or “verb groups” in the tradi-
tional grammar of the Romance languages (see the four conjugations of Classical
Latin or the three verb groups of French). They are ultimately a lexical feature
of each predicative phrase (and, among them, of verbs) that is exposed mor-
phologically through the selection of a specific inflectional paradigm. As a
consequence, learners of the language essentially have to memorize the predicative
class of each predicative phrase as they first encounter it. Contrast, for instance,
the pairs of semantically comparable verbs in the following examples:(549)    a. pcØ:                                   pci ̄:

ture pcØ in glosses (hence its absence in the glosses of the left-side forms in (549)),
as I analyze it as the default predicative class of the language. There is no obvious
morphosyntactic or semantic reason why a verb meaning ‘to eat’ should be lexi-
cally assigned to pcØ while one meaning ‘to drink’ is assigned to pci ̄ (as shown in
example (549a)), or why a verb meaning ‘to sleep’ should be lexically assigned to
pcØ while one meaning ‘to rest’ is assigned to pcrǖ (as shown in (549c)). It seems
even more arbitrary and unpredictable that the two suppletive forms of the verb
meaning ‘to kill’, one of them taking a singular object and the other one taking a
plural object, should be lexically assigned to two different predicative classes (pci ̀
for the former, pcØ for the latter, as shown in (549b)).","[483, 484]"

"4.2.5        Incorporating nominals to the verb root or
             verb stem
   Incorporation233 in smat is a morphosyntactic strategy that has the effect of
integrating into a verb root or a verb stem a nominal constituent (whether
a bound noun or an NP) that could in principle be alternatively expressed as
(part of) a syntactically independent main constituent of the clause. The result-
ing incorporating verb stem or verb phrase is a verbal PP and may, as such, be
subject to incorporation (recursively, although this only marginally occurs) and to
the derivational morphology of the PP. Incorporation forces the integrated nominal
constituent to occur in a rigid morphosyntactic configuration relative to the verb
root or verb stem. It additionally prevents it from featuring any syntactic-function
marking. The pragmatic effect of incorporation can be roughly characterized as
that of decreasing, to varying degrees, the discourse salience of the referent
corresponding to the incorporated nominal constituent. Incorporation is a high-
frequency phenomenon in smat discourse.",[321]

4. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
    (iii) Non-core participant incorporation Finally, in non-core partic-
ipant incorporation, the semantic role of the incorporated constituent does
not correspond to that of either of the possible core arguments of the verb
root/stem. The interpretation of that semantic role is mostly left to context and
may be delicate to establish with certainty. In most cases, the referent identified
by the incorporated constituent can be broadly interpreted as having the semantic
role of a ground (portion of space proper, as in example (341); container, as in
(342); or vehicle, as in (328b) above) or as characterizing the state reached by
the object of a transitive verb denoting a transformation process (as in (343); see
also (169)). The valency of the verb root/stem and its mapping of syntactic po-
sitions with semantic roles are left unaltered. Non-core participant incorporation
virtually always involves the incorporation of bound nouns (not entire NPs). Like
possessee incorporation, non-core participant incorporation may yield relatively
lexicalized incorporating verb stems, although it is generally more flexible and
productive than core argument incorporation.","[329, 330, 331]"
"    The manner deictic word ñâak̃̀ ǜ ‘in this manner’, which occurs with both en-

4.5.3      Valency operations with no dedicated
           exponence4.5.3.1     Passive construction    In smat, the more patient-like argument of a transitive predicate (syntactically
represented as a core object in the transitive construction) may by no means be
omitted from an utterance without the simultaneous addition of dedicated deriva-
tional morphology to the predicative phrase (on the antipassive suffixes /-ètà/, /-ē/
and /-tàe/̄ , which allow such an omission, see Section 4.5.1). By contrast, the more
agent-like argument of a transitive predicate (syntactically represented as a subject
in the transitive construction) may be omitted from an utterance without the addi-
tion of any specific derivational morphology to the predicative phrase. When this
occurs, the predicate merely becomes intransitive and the more patient-like
argument is promoted to the syntactic function of subject, i.e. the only core
argument position left in the resulting utterance. I call “passive construction” this
intransitive use of typically transitive predicative phrases with no derivational mor-
phology involved. Contrast the ordinary transitive construction in example (437a),
where both agent and patient referents are overtly mentioned, with the passive
construction in (437b), where only the patient referent is retained:(437)    a. Transitive construction:
            Chānā-chă.
            chā=nā=chă
            1sg.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=paint
            ‘I paint it.’
        b. Passive construction:
            Ná-chă.
            ná=chă
            3m/n/ns.sbj=paint
            ‘It is painted.’ [jsg elic.]Examples (438a) and (438b) illustrate the exact same contrast in spontaneous tex-
tual examples:(438)    a. Mā kùnā-g̃üè̊ gūʼü?̃́ – Mārü!̄

              the plate is upside down [lit. ‘... is flipped over.’].’ [rca & jca E34]Examples (439) and (440) feature both a passive construction and an ordinary tran-
sitive construction involving the same verb, specifically the verb root wü̏ ‘to scratch,
to write’ in (439) (with the passive construction coming first and the transitive con-
struction coming next) and the verb root yĕ ‘to chop down (smaller trees)’ in (440)
(with the two constructions occurring in the reverse order; note that the verb root
tūʼu ‘to fell (bigger trees)’ at the end of (440) also appears in a passive construction):(439)   Ná-nŭʼà, chôʼrǖ pōpēràgú. Mā ná-wü̏ ì especie. Especie de plátano—pōʼi ̋—

4.2.4.3       /-na̽/ ‘open’    The derivational suffix of the verb root /-na̽/ ‘open’ only occurs on transitive
verb roots in my data. Its semantic contribution is to indicate that the process
denoted by the verb root and performed on the object referent (which at the ini-
tial phase of the process features continuous boundaries tightly separating a por-
tion of space) causes that referent to no longer feature continuous boundaries.
In other words, in indicates that the process results in the object referent becom-
ing open (three-dimensional entity), perforated (two-dimensional entity, such as a
poster), or unfastened (linear entity, such as a belt). This suffix, which could be
said to denote a [-sealed] feature, is the positive counterpart of /-tā/ ‘closed’ (on
which see the previous section). Illustrations of the use of this suffix are provided
in examples (318–320).",[318]

(iii) Verb allomorph selection. The singular vs plural (or collective) value
of the number feature of the subject argument of certain verbal intransitive pred-
icative phrases, and that of the object argument of certain verbal transitive pred-
icative phrases, is regularly—although not entirely systematically—encoded through
the selection of one or the other of the two suppletive forms of the verb root on
which these predicative phrases are based.",[494]

"   The lexicalized verb stem /ǘ-kù/ (be.there.sg-in.pl) is irregular in that, al-
though it is the singular allomorph of a PP meaning ‘to enter’ (which has a regular
plural allomorph /chó-kù/ [be.there.pl-in.pl]) and although its FGC suffix conse-
quently characterizes the spatial relation of a singular entity (in this case, a singular
subject referent), it features the plural—instead of singular—allomorph of that FGC.
The following example shows an occurrence of this verb stem in discourse:(289)              ̄ a̋ chi ̄-ük

gular or plural object)’ most likely lexicalized from a former verb stem ? /po̊ʼ-kú/
(block?-in.pl) meaning ‘to imprison (a plural object)’ (lit. ‘to block several entities
inside a ground’), potentially suggesting that imprisonment may be considered (or
have been considered) as the prototypical form of punishment in Tikuna culture.",[304]
