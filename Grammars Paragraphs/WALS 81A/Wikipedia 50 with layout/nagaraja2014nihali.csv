                  Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION   The term nahal in the Nihali/Nahali language means ‘tiger’ or
‘lion’. Russel and Hiralal (1916) describe the Nahal or Nihal as a
hybrid of the Bhil and Korku. They were also identified with an
ancient community, called Nahalka, mentioned in Padma Purana as
an offshoot of the Nishada. The Nahals are subdivided into
Raghuvanshi and Tavadia sections. The Korku, who first migrated
to the Berar region of Madhya Pradesh, found the Nahal in
possession of the hills. Gradually, the Nahals lost their land. They
are notified under the nomenclature Nihal/Nahul as a scheduled
tribe, and are grouped along with the Korku, Bopchi, Mouasai,
Bondhi and Bondeya. At present, the Nahals of this area speak
Nimari, an Indo-Aryan language. However, in some places like
Buldhana district of Maharashtra, Nahals speak their own language,
which is highly influenced by Korku and other languages. The
Nahals are further divided into a number of totemic clans (nata).
Monogamy is the norm. They mainly subsist on agriculture labour.
They are mostly employed as labourers in agricultural fields by
other communities. (From K.S.Singh’s People of India book)   Nihali, also Nahali, had 3600 speakers according to 1961 census
of India reports. The speakers are found in an area of about fifty
square miles in the northern extremes of Buldhana district of
Maharashtra. Though Nihals are found in Amravati district of
Maharashtra and East Nimar district of Madhya Pradesh, in the
foothills of the western-most range of the Satpuda mountains they
no longer speak their own speech form. According to the available
information there are no monolingual adult Nihals. Only two brief
descriptive articles have appeared on this language so far.
However, comparative studies have been somewhat richer, since the
genetic relation of Nihali is a matter of dispute. Konow believed
the language to be Munda, with heavy Dravidian and Indo-Aryan
2                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyaccretion. But even the Munda element consists largely of Korku
loans, and in 1941 R.Shafer proposed that Nahali represents an
altogether separate stock. F.B.J. Kuiper has shown that over 20
percent of the available vocabulary of Nahali is unrelated to that of
any Indian linguistic family. The present study corroborates with
this view.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"
"   From the above paradigm many aspects of verbal structure
becomes clear and it can be seen that sentences end in verbal
constructions. First of all, the word order is Subject-Verb in an
intransitive sentence. Here, the verb kap- ‘to sleep’ occurs after the
subject jo ‘I’. In a negative sentence, the negative marker normally
occurs preceding the verb. The verbal structure does not show any
68                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyform of agreement with the rest of the sentence. The verbal
structure is pretty simple. The verbal construction carries tense
marker, aspect and mood markers in 'word' structure. The t/a/m
markers follow the verb base.
   In a NP, adjective precedes the Noun. Similarly adverbs precede
the verb. Unlike other language families of the area, there is no
agreement in this language.","[78, 79]"
"4.2.10. Word Order: The word order is SOV, similar to Korku, IA
and Dravidian. However Nihali order is quite simple and analytic as
compared to that of Korku or other language structures. The
important aspect of Nihali verbal structure is that it does not carry
any person/number/gender markers unlike Korku system which is
highly complex in this aspect. This feature can be considered as an
additional testimony to treat Nihali as unrelated to Munda
languages. Also verb stems are unchanging in Nihali irrespective of
the tense marker; while Korku has changing type.",[155]
"     In the above instance, there are four VPs, the subject, ra:ja
‘king’ performing various activities in sequential order. They are:
cargokka e:ri ‘went running’, which contains cargokka ‘running’
non-finite verb and the main verb e:ri ‘went’; the other verb phrases
connected by coordinate relation are: a:yren phe:ri1 ḍo kaṭuy2 ḍo
a:pakini3 ‘mother-obj removed (from under the firewood); and
lifted; and weeping (started)’.    (e) (kay) eṭeynaka ceki1 ḍo wocoli2 ḍo ko:ya3 ḍo gaḍḍaki

        pit-in put-pt4 and bury-pt5 and house-towards returning6
        ‘(so) she-herself was caught and lifted and carried and put
        in the pit and buried and towards the house returning’
120                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary   In the above instance, which is quite complex by having six
simple clauses, but without the agent overtly expressed; but
connected by connector ‘and’. Actually all are potentially simple
sentences. As this instance is taken from a text (narration), the agent
is expressed in the previous sentence. So here it is understood. In
the first clause the object is mentioned first, as in (kay) eṭeynaka
ceki1 ‘(so) she herself (obj.) was caught’, followed by four simple
clauses, containing only the verbs concerned, like : ḍo wocoli2 ḍo
ko:ya3 ḍo gaḍḍaki kama:y4 ḍo gaḍa:yi5 ‘and lift-pt2 and carry-pt3 and
pit-in put-pt4 and bury-pt5’. The last clause continues in the same
manner but the verb takes a different tense marker, ḍo a:wa:rhinga
wortakini6 ‘and house-towards returning6’; while all the previous
ones are in past tense.","[130, 131]"
"(B) Echo forms, do not appear to be native to this speech form.
Whatever is found seems to have come from Korku. As can be seen
below, there are two subtypes. First, those which involve change of
initial consonant only in the repeated part; and the second, which
involves vowel change in the repeated part. But the first one is an
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                                107instance which has both consonantal as well as vocalic change in the
repeated part. Also, there is no commonness between the consonant
changes; while in case of vocalic changes always the first (base)
vowel is [a], and in the reduplicated part it changes to either [u] or
[o] only.(178)(a) ma:nḍi-runḍi ‘talking/consultation etc.’ [m- > r-; -a- > -u-]

3.12.1. Word Order
The word order in this speech form is SOV. It is quite simple and
analytic. An important aspect of Nihali verbal structure is that it
does not carry any person/number/gender markers unlike Korku or
Indo-Aryan. Though the normal word order is SOV, as can be seen
from most of the illustrations, it is possible to have OSV, as in
focusing, etc. :(180)   tembrya dho:r-na cekiya OR dho:r-na tembrya cekiya
        tiger-sub cow-obj catch-pt     cow-obj tiger-sub catch-pt
          S        O       V           O     S         V
   Both the above constructions mean only ‘tiger caught the cow’,
as the nouns carry appropriate case markers.","[117, 118, 119]"
"4.2.12. Conclusion: The above limited comparison clearly shows
that Nihali is not similar to Korku. Though from the point of
structural considerations, there is some similarity. But beyond that
no similarity can be found. This dissimilarity probably prompted
Bhattacharya in 1954 itself to consider it as a non-Munda language.
The present description clearly supports his contention. In this
language verbal structure is very simple. Normally verbs occur after
the noun phrase(s) in a sentence. In other words, verbal structure
ends a sentence. The verbal structure normally consists of the verb
root+tense +/ aspect marker only. So verbal morphology, though
agglutinative in nature, is quite simple. While a three-way tense
distinction is available, only two aspectual distinctions are noted;
and moods are not very complex. There are only three moods, viz.
indicative mood, which is unmarked, imperative mood and
interrogative mood. So, except for these three moods, no finer
distinctions seem to be available.
   Though this language agrees with all other languages of the area
in word order like Indo-Aryan, Dravidian or Munda), verbs do not
154                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularytake any agreement elements. From that point of view, it is very
different from them.","[164, 165]"
"    Nihali texts represent the narratives dealing with several aspects of tribal
life including the traditional knowledge, life style, equality of persons, joy and
sorrow of the people and their philosophy of life. The texts are represented in
phonetic transcription, rather than transliteration, to preserve the spoken style
of the narratives. Each sentence is numbered, with word-to-word meaning and
free translation into English. Nihali lexical items are given in the English
alphabetical order with their meanings on the left side and the source of
borrowing, if any, on the right (in a three-column arrangement).
    Nihali was identified as a separate speech in the mid 1950s by the late
Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya and after a lapse of nearly six decades, the present
volume is the first original detailed study of this endangered language isolate.
It will be of great interest to the students and scholars of Linguistics,
Anthropology, Folklore, Lexicography, Education and Language Planning.
Dr.Nagaraja deserves the appreciation of academic community for his

"   Also, for ‘first’ instead of the above number ‘one’, a totally
different form ceyni is used. It means both ‘first’, ‘previous’ as well
as ‘before/preceding’, depending upon the context.:(78)(a) eṭey ceyni cergoki jita:ya
        he first running-in won
        ‘he succeeded in the very first attempt’.     (b) jo ceyni pa:ṭi
         I first came
         ‘I came first’.     (c) ceyni nana ‘first son’.

   But for others like 2nd, 3rd Hindi words are used. : du:sra, ti:sra
respectively.-phera construction:
(79)(a) biḍiphera biḍimanso tembra:n paḍa:yḍa:n
        once one man tiger kill-had
        ‘once a man had killed a tiger’    (b) jo daccophera cergi
        I ten times run-pt
        ‘I ran ten times’3.7. VERBS3.7.0. General remarks: In this language verbal structure is very
simple. Normally verbs occur after the noun phrase(s) in a sentence.
In other words, verbal structure ends a sentence. The verbal
structure normally consists of the verb root+tense +/ aspect marker
only. So, the verbal morphology though agglutinative in nature, is
quite simple. While three-way tense distinction is available, only
two aspectual distinctions are noted; and moods are not very
complex. There are only indicative mood, which is unmarked,
imperative mood and interrogative mood. So, except for these three
moods, no finer distinctions seem to be available.
   On the whole a verb is capable of taking verbalizer/infinitve
marker –be. However all verbs do not take it. Particulalry
intransitive verbs like imni ‘be’, ulta:y ‘fall’, harp- ‘lose’, ola(y)-
‘be wet’, pya-/pak- ‘come’, cark- ‘fall’, doksa- ‘flow’, etc. Most of
the transitive verbs are capable of taking infinitive marker.
   Though this language agrees with all other languages of the area
in word order (like Indo-Aryan, Dravidian or Munda), verbs do not
take any agreement markers. From that point of view it is very
different from them.
60                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary   A noun can function like a verb, by taking verbal forms, such as
kamay ‘to do’ or jere(y) ‘to happen’ or ca(:)ka- ‘to climb’ readily
converts a foreign word into a native one. Native verbs do not take
any of them mentioned above, they are inherently verbs, while
others need one of the above mentioned forms for their
verbalization. For instance: kama(y) is the most common form,
which also functions as an independent verb, but functions as an
auxiliary when occurs with another verb or converts a
noun/adjective into a verb. Further it is used with intransitive verb
to obtain transitive form of it (see below for it). For instance:(80)(a) kamay: pata:r ‘dry’ : pata:r-kamay +-be = pata:rkambe ‘to
        dry (cloth)’,
        ila:j ‘treatment’: ila:j-kamay + -be = ila:jkambe ‘to treat
        some one’,
        ulṭa ‘up side down’: ulṭa-kamay +-be = ulṭakam-be ‘to
        cause to fall’, etc.;     (b) jere(y) ‘to happen’: dil ‘heart’: dil-jere ‘to heart move’,
         gelti ‘mistake’ :   gelti-jere-be ‘to commit mistake’
         kama:y ‘work’ : kama:y-jere-be ‘to do the work’     (c) ca(:)ka ‘to climb’: ja:ra-cakay ‘fever climbed’
        khi:jo ‘anger’:      khi:jo-cakay ‘anger climbed’
        a:rsa ‘lazyness’:    a:rsa-cakay ‘lazyness came’, etc.","[69, 70, 71]"
"If the normal word order of a sentence is changed, from SOV to
SVO, as given below, without an overt subordinator, the first clause
becomes a subordinate clause and the second one, the main clause;
by that the whole construction is a complex sentence. For instance:
instead of jo a:wa:rki e:riḍa:n ‘I had gone home’, if becomes : jo
e:riḍa:n a:wa:r-ki, with the change of order, it becomes a
subordinate clause.(227)(a) jo e:riḍa:n a:wa:r-ki / eṭey hey beṭhe ḍa:n
          I went      house-to he be neg was
          ‘(when) I went home he was not at home’
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                                127Similarly,
    (b) jo e:rida:n a:wa:r-ki / eṭey imric/imnic ḍa:n
          I went     house-to he be
          ‘(when) I went home he was at home’     (c) ha:n ceyni ḍa:w pa:ṭiḍa:n hibiya-ki       kho:bo manta ḍa:n
         this first time came-had this-village-in lot people were
         ‘(when) I came to this village first time lot of people were’Quotative construction is obtained by using -ki as a quotative
particle:(228)(a) kay ra:ja henni ki “engki dewtabuditañ goṭari ko:be”
        so king said that “me-to sunset-till       deer bring”
        ‘so the king told (the hunters) that bring a deer to me before
         sunset’.      (b) maka a:yrere henni ki “inginna pura burikamay
          so mother(deer) said that “we totally covered
         ḍo ja:litakamay”
         and netted as well”
         ‘so mother deer told (her family) that we have been
         surrounded completely and netted as well’.","[137, 138]"
"   The Nihali language has great significance, due to its uniqueness,
in not having any known relationship with any known language. In
this regard Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya had conducted a fieldtrip in
1954-55. After that, though some data was collected from the
Nahals of Buldhana district of Maharashtra, in the sixties of
previous century under the Munda project, it came to light only in
1996, in the form of Nihali lexicon published in a Journal called
Mother Tongue in the USA. Other than that, no scholar had shown
any interest in this language. In order to fill this vacuum in 1996 a
pilot study was conducted by the present scholar to ascertain where
these speakers are living. That fieldtrip was successful in locating
these speakers, in a place called Jamud, and in the neighboring areas
in Buldhana district of Maharashtra. There are not many villages
where this language is spoken.",[13]
"3.7.7. Transitive formation: Transitive is a two-place predicate,
having an agent and the object; while the intransitive is a one place-
predicate. The underlying object of one place-predicate acts as the
subject. It is an intransitive. In many other cases if the verb itself is
of transitive type, kamay is not needed. For instance:
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                                 83
(124)(a) iṭimanso tandur ṭye
          that-man rice eat-pt
          ‘that man ate rice’,
   here the verb ‘eat’ is transitive, so does not take kamay. Similarly
the verb ber- ‘to cut’, as in the following:     (b) eṭey cekṭo-ki a:ḍḍon beri
         he axe-with tree-obj cut-pt
         ‘he cut a tree with axe’The verb ‘give’ is a three-place predicate with Ag, object and
recipient, as in the following:(125) (a) nana pirjo-ki patra be-e
          Ag1 Ag2           Obj3 V
          boy girl-to      letter give-pt
          ‘boy gave a letter to the girl’.      (b) ḍa:ktar mantaki sũy-i be:ka
          Ag1       Ag2         Obj3    V
          doctor people-to injection/needle gives
          ‘doctor gives injection to people’.","[93, 94]"
"NUM + N (animate)+ hiṭkel:
(186)(a) biḍi giṭa ‘one younger sister’:
           i:r-giṭa-hiṭkel
           two-young.sister-both ‘two sisters’           i:r-ḍa:y-hiṭkel         ‘two brothers-both’
        (b) ma:w ‘horse’: i:rma:w hiṭkel ‘two horses’
      (c) na:y ‘dog’ : i:rna:y hiṭkel ‘two dogs’NUM/QUANT+N (inanimate):
(187) i:r pustok ‘two books’: kho:bo pustok ‘plenty of books’
      biḍi ca:go ‘one stone’ : i:r ca:go ‘two stones’QUANT+N(animate):
(188)(a) kho:bo ma:w-ṭa     ‘many/plenty horses’
         kho:bo na:y-ṭa     ‘many/plenty dogs’
QUANT+N (inanimate): Here the plural marker is not used.:
     (b) kho:bo ca:go ‘plenty/many stone(s)’   In case of noun a:wa:r ‘house’ holds a special position. It can
also mean ‘home’/ ‘family’, so it can take hiṭkel, as in the following:(189)      i:r-a:wa:r hiṭkel ‘two houses’ (= members of two houses)
           kho:bo a:wa:r ‘many houses’
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                              111         kho:bo a:wa:r he:la ‘all of many houses’
         he:la gives ‘inclusive sense of family’. So, it is used with
         animate nouns. Similarly:(190)    bidi bakko ‘one hand’
         i:r bakko hiṭkel ‘two hands-both’
         kho:bo bakko ‘many hands’
         kho:bo bakko he:la ‘many hands - people’Possessive constructions: Here also the structure is: Pos.+N:(191) enge pa:lso           ‘my child’
      enge pirjo pa:lso
      my female child       ‘my female child’  The following NP consists of a possessive phrase at the
beginning followed by another NP containing demonstratives.:(192) enge-a:wa:r iṭi-a:ḍḍo uṭi-dha:r-ki (iṭi-a:ḍḍo uṭi-dha:r ‘that
      tree’s that side’)
      my house that tree that side-of
      ‘my house (is) that tree’s that side’   Two Noun Phrases can occur in a sequence in coordinate
relation, connected by the connector ḍo ‘and’:(193) biḍi-bakko-ki lakri ḍo biḍi-bakko-ki kanḍil…
      one hand-in stick and one hand –in lantern…
      ‘a stick in one hand and a lantern in another hand…’   Oppositive NPs can contain two NPs in opposition. Here is an
instance of the same. In this phrase enge bakkoka kha:na pi:na and
another NP acca-acca pakwa:n are in opposition. The first NP is a
possessive construction, ‘my hand’s food (= eating-drinking)’. The
112                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularysecond part qualifies the first part. It is in opposition to the second
NP acca-acca pakwa:n ‘good-good food’.(194)    enge bakkoka kha:na pi:na acca-acca pakwa:n…
         my hand-s    food drink good-good eatables…
         ‘my hand’s food drink good-good delicious items…’3.12.3. Verb phrases: These are made up a main verb, being
obligatorily present and preceded by either an adverbial
construction and or an object. A few illustrations can be provided
here. The first is an imperative construction, where both the subject
and second person are absent, and supposed to be covertly present.
Interestingly it contains an adverbial element as first member, jaldi
‘quickly’, followed by an indirect object, basel he:la:ki ‘to the
children’, and an object, beḍe-beḍe mitha:yi ‘one-one sweet’, and
finally the verb, in imperative formation, be:-ki ‘give’.(195)     jaldi basel he:la-ki beḍe-beḍe mitha:yi be:ki
          quickly child-all-to one-one sweet-obj give-imp.
          'Give quickly one-one sweet to all the children'   In the next two illustrations, the adverbial elements occur after
the subject NP, and followed by the main verb.(196)(a) jo seko:n minḍi ḍecco celom-na kappi
         I yesterday night 10 o’clock-at sleep-pt
         'I slept at 10 P.M. yesterday night'      (b) jo ro:ju-ka kama:y      sene-ka
          I daily      work –obj go-npt
          'I go to work daily'   In the following construction, the subject (NP) is a personal
pronoun jo ‘I’, or ne ‘you’(sg.); followed by the verbal complex
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                               113containing the object backaren ‘children’ in (a), and hi-ka:mo ‘this
work’ in (b), followed by the transitive verbs in past tense, in (a)
and non-past tense in (b).(197)(a) jo backa-ren anglujkamay
         I    baby-obj bathe-make
        'I bathed the baby'.     (b) ne hi-ka:mo kama:ken
         you this-work do-can
         ‘You can do this work’In the following two instances, the NP is more fuller in structure. In
(a), it is made up of a possessive construction, dharamra:ja-na orari
‘dharamraja’s wedding’ followed by the verbal structure. Similarly,
in (b) the NP is made up of the plural demonstrative hiṭkel taking a
postposition minja:r ‘middle’, to obtain hiṭkella minja:r ‘between
them’; followed by the object, tago-jagṛa ‘quarrel/fight’, and the
verb of happening, jere- in past tense.(198)(a) dharamra:ja-na orari     jerey-ḍa:n
        dharmaraja-pos wedding happen-perf
        'Dharamraja's marriage had taken place'    (b) hiṭkella minja:rki tago-jagṛa jerey
        both between-to      fight happen-pt
        ‘they both fought with each other’   The above illustrations provide some insight into the internal
structures of sentences. They also reveal the place of adverbials
when they occur. In the following, various types of sentences both
from the nature of the verb, and from the complexity will be
discussed. In this process it is hoped that some more insights will be
available as far as the language structure is concerned.

3.12.4. Types of sentences:(a) Existential sentences:
These sentences will have the main verb of ‘to be’ type. But in
negative constructions, as in (c) below, the verb for be is imne/imni
is used in positive constructions; while in negative constructions hey
+ beṭhe ‘negative form’ is used.(199)(a) a:wa:r-sammaki mandir ḍa:n
         house-front-in     temple is
         ‘there is a temple in front of the house’      (b)   biya-kon paslaki para:y ḍa:n
             village-of behind-to river is
             ‘there is a river behind the village’      (c)   paray-ki joppo imni/e
            river-in water be
            ‘there is water in the river’ vs.            paray-ki joppo hey beṭhe:la
            river-in water be neg
            ‘there is no water in the river’(b) Identificational sentences:
In this type of constructions no verb is overtly used. Placement of
two NPs sequentially makes a sentence. Here also it is possible to
obtain negative constructions using the negative form beṭhe. For
instance,
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                                 115(200)(a) jo / do:ktar ‘I (am) a doctor’ vs. jo / do:ktar beṭhe ‘I
          (am) not a doctor’
     (b) iṭiko:l / guruji ‘that woman (is) teacher’ vs.
          iṭiko:l / guruji/ beṭhe ‘that woman (is) not teacher’
      (c) iṭimanso / korku ‘that man (is) Korku’
      (d) herey / banjara ‘this (person) (is) a banjara’, etc.
      (d) eṭey enge dusman beṭhe ‘he (is) not my enemy’
      (e) eṭey nani ‘who (is) he?’ vs. eṭey ḍa:kṭar ‘he (is) a doctor’
      (f) uṭan na:n ‘what (is) that?’ vs. uṭan ka:kado ‘that (is) a
          paper’(c) Attributive sentences:
This type of sentence also does not take a verb/copula. Here the
attribute of the subject will follow the subject concerned. The result
is a complete sentence. Here also it is possible to obtain negative
constructions by adding negative form beṭhe, as shown below.(201)(a)   hi manso / masto        vs. hi-manso masto beṭhe
           this man good               this-man good-neg
           ‘this man (is) good’        ‘this man (is) not good’      (b) eṭlan a:wa:r/ mera:ki
          his house near-to
          ‘his house (is) near’     (c)   engen a:wa:r/ backa
           my house small
           ‘my house (is) small’     (d)   hi a:ḍḍo / bha:ga lamba
           this tree very long
           ‘this tree (is) very long’      (e) ne /nu-san ‘how (are) you?’ vs. jo masto ‘I (am) fine’
116                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary(d) Possessive sentences:
In this type also except for verb imni(c)/imri(c) ‘be’, and ṭha:k- ‘to
have’ type; no other verb is used. Placement of two NPs
sequentially makes a sentence. Here also the negative constructions
can be obtained by using the negative form beṭhe, as shown below.
For instance:(202)(a) a:ḍḍo-ki phu:l imric
          tree-in flower be-np
         ‘the tree has flower’      (b) eṭey gida:r janwarṭa ṭha:ki
          he many animals have-np
          ‘he has many animals’.(203)(a)   ra:m-ki / biḍi-ka bakko
           ram-to one-only hand
           ‘ram (has) one-only hand’       (b) dho:r-ki/ na:lku khuri
           cow-to        four leg
           ‘cow (has) four legs’      (b) a:ṭo-ki / i:rbakko biḍi peñ
          man-to / two hand one head
          ‘man has two hands one head’.      (c) a:wa:rki / biḍi-bi da:na hey beṭhe
          house-at one-even grain be neg
          ‘at home not even a grain is’      (d) ha:n / nanin a:wa:r ‘this whose house ?’ vs. ha:n /enge
          a:wa:r ‘this my house’.
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                              117(e) Interrogative sentences: In this type, the interrogative forms
occur at the end of the sentence. For instance:(204)     ne jumu na:n
          your name what
          ‘What is your name?’
         (See Interrogatives section for details)(f) Negative sentences have been amply illustrated in sec. 3.7.6.
So, they are not discussed here.","[121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128]"
"Dative-subject constructions are found in this language, on line with
other languages of the area.:

          me-to          sweet-obj very much like
          'I (=to me) like sweet(s) very much'3.12.5. Sentence patterns: Basically sentences are classified into
three types based on the number of main clauses it contains. It has
been noticed that speakers of this speech form either use either only
118                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyactive voice or impersonal voice; but seldom use passive voice.
Also, very simple constructions are noted. If a sentence has single
main clause, then it is a simple sentence. Most of the illustrations so
far have been of this type. The second type is that which contains
two main clauses either connected by a connector or without it, is
called compound sentence. See below for illustration. The third type,
which is called complex sentence, contains one main clause and one
or more subordinate clauses embedded with in the main clause. The
subordinate clauses are obtained by converting a main clause by use
of a subordinator element, discussed below. (i) Simple sentences: Already quite a few illustrations have been
provided for this type. So, a few examples for simple sentences are
provided here, which illustrate the word order, etc.:(206)(a) tembrya dongor-ki bhum-ka

         'tiger walks in the forest'.      (b) la   kaṭamkika kamayhona
          you(pl.) silently do-need
          ‘you (pl.) silently should do the work’(ii) Compound sentences: Compound/Coordinate sentences are
made up of two or more main clauses conjoined by an overt or
covert connector. Though normally three subtypes are identified
among the connectors, coordinate connector ḍo ‘and’ is more
common than others. The others are pine/i, pani, okon ‘but’, sorka:n
‘even then’, baken ‘otherwise’, etc.(i) ḍo ‘and’:

"   The above three samples provide some insight into the sentence
formation in this speech form, particularly in narrations. These
constructions contain many verbal phrases or simple clauses
connected by the additive coordinator ḍo ‘and’. As could be
observed from above, often the subject will be absent, and even the
object is understood. So the verb finite form is used, which mark
various actions. All are sequentially arranged both chronologically
as well as temporally.(ii) pini/e, pani ‘but’:

"3.7.1. Types of verbs
Verbs are normally classified into different types based on whether
they take an object or not. They are intransitive, where no object can
occur; transitive, and bi-transitive based on whether the verb can
take one or more than one object. Besides these, a verb ‘be’ belongs
to a different type altogether; and a few verbs do not belong to any
of the above types. A few illustrations follow.:(82) (a) Intransitive verb, which does not take an object (= one place
         predicate): kapp- ‘to sleep’, e:r- ‘to go’, a:pa- ‘to weep’,
         pej- ‘to run’;
     (b) Transitive verbs (= two-place predicate): okk- ‘to keep’,
         ja:m- ‘to buy’, ber- ‘to cut’, be: ‘to give’, etc.;       (c) Causative verbs (= three-place predicates): paḍa- ‘to kill’,
           etc.",[72]
"    The grammatical analysis and description are carried out within the model
of modern American Structural linguistics. Establishment of functional
sounds, their contrasts, distribution and allophones together with syllable
structure form the description of phonology. The term grammar comprises the
                                       iv
traditional morphology as well as syntax with convincing examples drawn
from elicited data and texts. Under noun morphology person, number, gender
and case are detailed together with pronouns and numerals. The morphosyntax
of verb-structure reveals the unique structural patterns of Nihali. The original
analysis is supported by nearly 250 phrases, clauses and sentences, each point
dwelling and dealing with structural nuances. Dr.Nagaraja’s Nihali Language:
Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary is a landmark of his years of linguistic
fieldwork on different minor, neglected and tribal languages. He has firsthand
experience of working on Austroasiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Dravidian group
of languages. One may recall his earlier grammatical treatises on Khasi, Korku
and Konyak together with texts and multilingual dictionaries.","[4, 5]"
"   In order to obtain negative indefinite forms a negative form is
placed after the indefinite form. For instance: nani-ka pa:ṭhoka
'someone comes' vs. nani-ka beṭhe pa:ṭho 'no one comes'.",[153]
"An intransitive verb is converted by using another verb kamay ‘to
do’ to obtain a transitive verb, as can be seen above. Similarly, in
the following sets:(126) (a) joppo raban-ka ‘water is cold’, as it has only one argument,
           the object. While the following:
       (b) jo joppona rabankamay
           I water-obj cool-ed
           ‘I cooled the water’.
   It has an agent as well as an object. So it is transitive.

Chapter 3 / Grammar                                                 85   As can be observed from above, intransitive verb can be
converted into a transitive verb by adding a verb kama(y) to the
intransitive verb.
A verb like eger- ‘to remove/shave’ behaves like an intransitive, and
so takes kamay to become transitive, even when used for self. But as
they are made up of two-place predicates, the verbs are transitive.;
as in the following:(132) (a) jo ba:y da:ṛi egerkamay
          I today beard removed
          ‘today I removed beard’ (= I shaved (myself))        (b) eṭey enga-da:ṛi egerkamay
            he my-beard removed
            ‘he shaved my beard’        (c) backaren a:pa-hora-kama:-biji
            children-obj weep-cause-not
            ‘don’t make children weep’ (the agent is understood; so the
            verb is transitive).        (d) jo eṭeyna a:pakamay (*a:pahorakamay)
            I him-obj weep-make
            ‘I caused him to weep’3.7.8. Causative formation: There are some lexical causatives in
this speech form, as can be seen from the following sets.:(133)     beṭṭ- ‘to die’      paḍay- ‘to kill’
          ṭye:-be ‘to eat’    ceṭṭhoki ‘cause to eat’/‘to feed’Causative is a three-place predicate with controlling agent Ag1,
performing agent Ag2 and the undergoer Obj3 of the action denoted
86                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyby the verb. Causative verb is obtained morphologically when the
above condition is met.:(1) First type, where the verb is inherently of bi-transitive type,
which does not require any other support to obtain a causative
construction:
(133) jo eṭeyna a:pho berika
      Ag1 Ag2 Obj3        V
      I him-to firewood cut
      ‘I get wood cut by him/ I make him to cut wood’(2) Second type, where the verb is transitive type, but requires
another verb of ‘make/cause’ to obtain causative construction, as the
following:(134) jo nana:ṭaki joppo ḍelen-kamay
      Ag1 Ag2 Obj3         V-V
      I child-pl-to water drink-make
      ‘I made the children drink water’.","[94, 95, 96, 97]"
"3.1.2. Compounding: Compounding is neither productive nor
specific. Often no distinction is made between a compound and its
corresponding phrase. Even then some compounds can be
observed.:

    e:risa:l ‘last year’ (e:ri ‘went’, sa:l ‘year’)
    pa:ṭosa:l ‘next year’ (pa:ṭ- ‘to come’)      Verbal compounds normally will have an object.
      N+V verbal compounds:(8)   hombo jere-be ‘to bend’ (hombo ‘body’)
      siḍu jalu-ki   ‘to brew liquor’ (siḍu ‘liquor’)
      citra arku-be ‘to draw/carve a picture’ (citra ‘picture’)
      ja:li kama:-be ‘to enclose’ (with a net)Reduplication: This aspect will be discussed separately at the end of
this chapter (sec. 3.11.).
30                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary3.1.3. Derivation of nouns: Many verbs can be converted into nouns
by suffixing noun derivative suffixes, like –re, agentive singular
marker, or –hela ‘plural marker’; and also gender marking forms
like ko:l ‘woman, female’, a:ṭho ‘man, male’.(9)    barow-               ‘to sing’:
       baroko:l             ‘female singer’

       ara-hela ‘watchers’(12)   kappo-be ‘sleep’:
       kappo-re ‘sleeper’
       kappo-hela ‘sleepers’(13)   mer- ‘play’ :
       mer-hela ‘players’, etc.","[39, 40, 41]"
"   The above comparative table provides some interesting facts
about the possible closeness between Nihali and Korku. Out of two
hundred word list above, more than half are different between them.
Even without going into the statistics, it becomes quite clear that
they are not related from lexical point of view as well. When similar
comparison is carried out between Nihali and Dravidian languages
like Gondi, which was probably spoken in that area some time back;
we find many lexical items similar between them. This aspect
probably indicates to the fact that either Nihals lived for some time
with Gondi speaking people before reaching the present settlements.
Their oral literature does not reveal this aspect. Probably more
intensive work on their language and culture might reveal these
aspects.

                         NIHALI TEXTSThe texts are presented in fairly phonetic transcription, though some
extent of phonemicization has taken place. For instance, length is
indicated wherever observed; but keeping narrator’s pronunciation
into account, an attempt has been made to keep editing to a
minimum; so that the text is as far as possible as it is narrated. So,
length and nasalization are marked even though they are not
phonemic in the language, to facilitate accurate pronunciation. Also,
a given word may have length in one place, but may not show it in
another place. Sentences are given numbers. Sentences and their
glosses have been given subscripts for easy reference; however, it
may be noted that they themselves do not have any significance.","[165, 166, 167, 168]"
"3.8. Adjectives: Basically adjectives are those which modify a noun.
Adjectives precede the noun head in a nominal construction. When
an adjective precedes a head noun, it functions purely as a noun
modifier; while if the order is reversed, that is, when an adjective
occurs after the head noun, it becomes an adjectival predicate, as (a)
and (b) illustrate this point clearly. In such cases no other verb is
required, as in (b). Illustrations:

"4.2.6. Case: Case is marked by suffixes and/or postpositions. But
'case' is not highly distinctive. Many cases have undergone
syncretization. So, it is in a state of simplification. Nominative case
is unmarked. The first noun phrase in a sentence usually will be in
this case. If it is followed by another NP, it will be in accusative
case. Here, if the object is animate, then it is marked by the case
suffix. If the NP is inanimate, no case marker is used with it. In case
of animate NPs, human nouns take -n as the suffix, while non-
human nouns take -na as the suffix. For examples, see below.
Instrumental, dative and locative cases are marked by using the
same overt case suffix, -ki. Ablative and sociative cases are marked
by the use of the suffix (or postposition) -gon. (eṭey-gon 'from/with
him').

quite different from Nihali system. Though both use suffixes
(loosely put), the elements as such except for sociative case, others
are very different. In both quite a bit of syncretization has taken
place. But the syncretization is independent to each language, so
differences are observed. In Nihali instrumental, dative and locative
have merged into one, ablative and sociative have merged into one,
and accusative and possessive have merged into one. So, effectively,
only three distinctions can be observed. On the other hand, in Korku
instrumental and ablative have merged into one, and dative and
locative have merged into one. So here syncretization is relatively
less as compared to the Nihali situation. Both the languages use
postpositions to some extent.","[150, 151]"

"4.0. General remarks: The above brief description of Nihali
structure hopefully unravels the intrinsic nature of the language. But
as it is today, is probably less distinctive than what it might have
been a couple of centuries before. Though this structure can be
compared with any language structure typologically; it would be
more fruitful to compare it with the language which is physically
very close to it than others. Among the potential languages of the
area, Korku, Hindi, Marathi; Korku seems to have more influence
on Nihali than others, as most of the Nihals know Korku. Therefore
here an attempt is made to compare these two languages. Wherever
it is appropriate other languages will be brought into the picture. For
instance in case of numerals, Hindi numbers have taken over
beyond 4 (as mentioned above), and various lexical items also seem
to have similar source.
    The vocabulary, which is most affected of all; shows signs not
only of borrowing from Korku, but also from other sources like Dr.
and IA. As it is natural many of the borrowings have become
nativized in their system. Once a noun is taken into the language, it
behaves like a native form by taking regular number marker or hela.
Similarly a noun can function like a verb, by taking verbal markers,
such as kamay or jerey or caka-; or use of suffixes like –ka or –ki
readily converts a foreign word into a native one.",[140]
"3.1. Morphological processes
3.1.1. Affixation: In affixation mainly suffixation is employed in this
speech form. Prefixation is used marginally in adjectives section.
Infixation is almost not used at all. Suffixation is used to derive
agentive and other types of nouns from verbs, etc. For instance the
suffix –re is used to obtain agentive nouns from verbs and non-
agentive nouns. For instance:(1)(a) saykal ‘cycle’ + -re >       saykal-re ‘cycle rider’
       maw ‘horse’ + -re >          maw-re ‘horse rider’
       cana ‘dance’ + -re >         cana-re ‘dancer’
       pahun ‘guest’ + -re >        pahun-re ‘guest’ (one)
       jam ‘to buy’ + -re           jam-re ‘buyer’
(1)(b) ḍhol-be ‘to beat drum’ + -re > ḍhol-be-re ‘drummer’
                                    (ḍhol ‘drum’, be- ‘to beat’)
       asuḍ-be ‘to swing’ + -re > asuḍre ‘swinger’
                                    ( = one who swings)
       baro-be ‘to sing’+-re        baro-bi-ka-re ‘singer’Another suffix –hela means ‘all’ can be added to nouns to obtain
agentive nouns in plural.:(2)(a) biya ‘village’ + -hela >     biyahela ‘villagers’
       basel ‘child’ + -hela >      baselhela ‘children’
28                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary       pahun ‘guest’ +-hela >        pahunhela ‘guests’There is another suffix, –ji used to derive nouns from verbs,
adjective, etc. It provides a sense of thing/object used for a purpose.
For instance, a verb like ceki- ‘to hold’ + ji > cekiji ‘tongs’ (= that
which is used to hold something). But this method is not very
productive, as only a few instances of this type are available. They
are listed below:(b) ceki ‘to hold’ + -ji > cekiji ‘tongs’
    cacom ‘to taste sweet’ + -ji > cacomji ‘sweet things’
    aranga ‘to become stale (food)’ + -ji > aranga:ji ‘stale
    food’(left over)
Obviously this method needs to be explored further.","[38, 39]"
"4.2.7. Numerals: An interesting feature of the language is that
except for the first few numbers, all other numbers are from Indo-
Aryan. The interesting numbers for 3 are: mo:ṭho, 4: nalko, similar
words are in Dravidian, but not in either Indo-Aryan or Austric. The
numbers for 1 and 2 seem to be native words, without any
comparable forms in any language of the area.- biḍi/baḍa '1',

ira:r/i:r '2' (eraḍu ‘2’ in Kannada; Khasi, a Mon-Khmer language
spoken in Meghalaya has a:r 'two'!). Bhattacharya (1957) had given
two forms for 'one', one for masculine and another feminine. But the
present speakers know only one form, which is used without gender
distinction. Other numbers are borrowed from Hindi.
   In relation to Nihali situation, Korku retains a fairly complete
system of numerals; though younger generation tends to replace
them by IA numerals.","[151, 152]"
"   The most affected area is the Nihali phonology. The present
structure is such that it almost has become bland, and so similar to
other families of the area in many structural aspects. It was
indicated in the previous sections that vowel length and aspiration
are secondary; so their presence can be directly attributable to IA
languages. Similarly the retroflex series is very unstable, indicating
the possibility of it being non-native. Though at present these
speakers live away from the Dravidian communities like Gondi or
Kolami; probably they must have had some contact with them for
some considerable time before. Of course it is also possible that
130                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularysome of these features might have entered through the neighbouring
and alternate (Munda) language, particularly Korku. As most Nihals
live in close proximity to Korkus, and most of them are bilinguals in
Korku this is very likely.
4.1. The vowel system is simple, almost in line with Munda
languages like Korku. The morphemes are predominantly open
(vowel ending); seldom have initial or final consonant clusters. The
syllabic structure is mainly of CVCV type.
   There are no unusual features which can be considered to be
peculiar to this language. So, no checked sounds which are found in
Munda languages (even though Korku has lost this feature). Lexical
items are quite different from Korku or any other language; even
though some losses can be observed. Pronouns, demonstratives,
interrogatives, negatives, tense, aspect markers are all different as
compared to other languages. A list of two-hundred common words
has been given at the end of this section comparing Korku forms.
This will provide important lexical differences.","[140, 141]"

main clause. The structure of the subordinate clause is somewhat
changed compared to the main clause, in that the object occurs after

Also in this case the subormindate clause and the main clause are

                           GRAMMAR3.0. General remarks: Nihali’s word structure shows agglutinative
character; but it is simple. Not too many affixes get joined to a base
form. The roots of the language are primarily disyllabic with vowel
ending, though some consonant ending roots are possible. The
common canonical structure of a root is- CVC(C)V(C).
Morphological processes employed in this language are: affixation
(generally suffixation only (but potentially also infixation among
demonstratives only), compounding and reduplication.","[37, 38]"

similarity/difference between them. On the one hand the
relationship between Korku and Mundari will show how close they
are and on the other hand it will shoe how far Nihali is different
from them. However no quantification has been attempted here.
However the differences themselves will reveal the unrelatedness

"3.4.3. Interrogative forms*: The interrogative forms in this speech
form are the following- na:n 'what', nani 'who', naway 'why',
nawa:san 'how, why'; mi- ‘which’, meran 'when', minga:y 'where',
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                                39m(i)yan 'how much'. From this list it appears that basically there are
two interrogative bases, made of na- and mV-. By suffixing -n to the
first base, a form 'questioning inanimate object' is obtained; by
suffixing -i to the base of nan-, a form 'questioning an animate
object' is obtained; by suffixing -ay to the base of na-, a form* In this and the following section no distinction is made between
‘pronouns’ and ‘others’.‘questioning reason' is obtained. By suffixing -san to the
interrogative form ‘questioning reason’, a form 'questioning why' is
obtained. (Alternatively, the base may be considered to be nan
instead of na-; then it itself 'questions inanimate object', etc.). By
suffixing -ga:y to the base (mV-), a form 'questioning location' is
obtained, and by suffixing -(y)an to the same base a form
'questioning quantity' is obtained. Interrogative forms can either
occur at the beginning of the sentence or immediately after the
subject or at the end of a sentence depending upon the nature of the
question, as will be clear from below. So, they can take some case

"   I started taking interest on this language way back in 80s and 90s of
last century when I used to teach a course in Languages of South Asia in
which Nihali was also included. But at that time very little information on
the language was available except for Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya’s paper
based on a field trip in fifties of the same century. All other works
belonged to much earlier periods. Naturally I wanted to work on this
language. After completing work on Korku, I decided to work on Nihali.
The first fieldtrip was conducted in 1996 to locate the speakers of this
language. After locating the speakers every year I used to make short
visits to the areas and collect some data and compare the same with the
previous data to ascertain whether it is really same or different from them.",[6]
"Also, instead of pine, another form okon ((a) below) can be used to
express this concept.:(209)(a) engki hici:jo beṭhe hona okon iṭici:jo hona

         ‘I do not need this thing but I need that thing’.(iii) sorka:n ‘even then’:

        ‘even though field (cultivable) available does not work’In the following the subject of first sentence is omitted, and the
second subject of the second sentence suffices.:(211)    enge a:ra:y ḍo baselhela a:pakini

122                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary         ‘turn over this loaf   otherwise (it will) get burnt’Normally speakers avoid complex constructions. So, often a
complex seetence is converted into two simple sentences with or
without connectors.(213)    eṭey tye:-bi beṭhe ḍo ḍelen-bi beṭhe
         he eat-also neg and drink-also neg
         ‘he does not eat and does not drink either’Without an overt marker also it is possible to place two clauses
sequentially, as follows:(214)    engekon hika:mo beṭ-jere /ha:n engekon beṭ-jamatinj
         me-by thiswork neg-possible/ this me-by neg like
         ‘I cannot do this work (as) this (work) by me not
        understood/ liked’.(iii) Complex sentences: Complex sentence, contains one main
clause and one or more subordinate clauses embedded with in the
main clause. The subordinate clauses are obtained by converting a
main clause by use of a subordinator element, discussed below.
The following complex sentence contains one subordinate clause
followed by two main clauses in coordinate relation.:(215)   eṭey dukan-hinga e:r-e saykalna karpi ḍo pejgi

"3.6. Numerals: No native numeral system has been observed in this

for the first few numbers, all other numbers used in business
transactions are from Indo-Aryan. Only first number seems to be a
native word; without any comparable forms in any language of the
area. - biḍi/baḍa '1'. Bhattacharya (1957) had given two forms for
'one', one for masculine and another feminine. But the present
speakers know only one form, which is used without gender
distinction. Next three numbers are interesting and intriguing. They
seem to be borrowed from Dravidian source. They are: ‘2’ is:
ira:r/i:r (But Kannada (Dravidian) eraḍu; Khasi, a Mon-Khmer
language spoken in Meghalaya has a:r 'two'!); 3: mo:ṭho, and 4:

"3.11. Reduplication/Echo formation/Onomatopoeic expressions
(A) Reduplication is not very productive in this language. However,
verbs are repeated wholly, by which intensification or continuity of
an action is expressed. This is a very regular process. There are a
few formal repetitions, but are not functional in nature. For instance:(170) jikit-kon bhuy-bhuy ‘eye lash’, jikit dhura-dhura ‘eye brow’.
      While jikit means ‘eye’, the other part has to be taken as a
      whole, though they have reduplicative structure. There are a
      few more such instances in the language.: ti:r-ti:r ‘a bird’s
      name’, etc. (a) Repeating a verb provides a sense of intensification of the
 action concerned. For instance:(171) mer- ‘to play’   : mer-mer-ka     engki agin    bi
                         play-play-emp me-to sweat come-pt
                         ‘playing-playing sweat came to me’        pa:ṭo ‘to come’ : pa:ṭo-pa:ṭo-(ka)/ pa:ṭpa:ṭo ‘while
                          coming/returning’        bhum ‘to walk’ : bhum-bhum-ka ‘by walking-walking’
                         bhum-ja-bhum-ja ‘went-went’        kappo ‘to sleep’: kappo-kappo bi:ma:ri ‘by sleeping-sleeping

       ‘quarrel by mouth-mouth only’       osol ‘to boil’: osol-osol-ka ‘boiling’:
       osol-osolka joppo pura: poporka jerey

the main verb, as below.:

       eṭey ha:go-ha:go ma:nḍi
       he smile-smile speak-pt
       ‘he spoke smilingly’(e) Reflexive form hone can be reduplicated. Also, an element –jyu-
can be inserted within the repeated form as well. By that
voluntariness is emphasized. With reduplication it gets emphasized.
(This is the only instance of this kind available in the data).(177) jo honeka a:ra:y ‘ I myself saw’

"3.7.5. Moods: Modal distinctions are very few in this speech
variety. There are only indicative mood, which is unmarked,
imperative mood, marked by –be, in positive construction, and biji
in negative construction; and interrogative mood. As interrogative
74                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularywords occur very close to the verb in a construction, it has been
considered as a modal distinction. Still, it has been treated
separately. So, except for these three moods, no finer distinctions
are available.(i). Imperative verbal construction is marked by the suffix –be added
to the bare verb root.(107)(a) ne pejko-be ‘you run’
         laja-hela pejko-be ‘you all run’
         laja-hela me:r-be ‘you all play’     (b) ne eṭen pejakkama-be
         you him run-make-imp.
         ‘you make him run’      (c) ne baselhelan me:rokam-be

          ‘you make the children play’      (d) eṭeyki ca:y be-be
          him-to tea give-to
          ‘give him tea’      (e) Sometimes without the marker as well, it is possible to
convey imperativeness. For instance, ne eṛe ‘you go’ (sg.) (> ne:ṛe).
Here the imperative marker is not used. Still it conveys a sense of
imperativity.","[84, 85]"
"Also, without the case marker, it is possible to have such a
construction. In the following, the noun does not take any overt case
marker as the noun is the object. So, ola kapṛa uri ‘wearing wet
cloth’. :(55)   ola kapṛa uri     ayin beṭhe
       ‘wet cloth wearing good-not’
       ‘wearing wet cloth (is) not good’.",[59]
"    The fourth chapter, with a question whether Nihali is an Isolate,
the answer being that it is an isolate. Here this speech form has been
compared with Korku, which being very close to it physically as
well as most of the speakers are bilingual in it. As no other language
has any chance of being comparable as they are very different from
it, and Korku’s influence on it is most significant; an attempt has
been made in this chapter to compare them taking various aspects
and prove that it is not in any way connected to Korku. Also a list of
so-called two hundred basic wordlist has been provided for both the
languages. In addition, comparable wordlist has been provided
from Mundari, a close relative of Korku, which will serve the
purpose of indicating the relationship with Korku. This hopefully
supports the claim that Nihali is not related to Munda languages. No
attempt has been made to identify whether each comparable set is
native or borrowed. It has been left for the readers’ judgment to
decide on the closeness.",[16]
"Also, sometimes another negative form from Hindi (?) bigar
‘without’ is used.:(116)      bigar joppoki nawki ji:wta:ken
           ‘Without water how (one) will live ?’ho:ṭo: In past tense ho:to ~ ho:ṭo is used to mark negation. So no
separate tense marker is used. It always precedes the verb. In the
process, the final vowel of it gets dropped in some cases, and in
some cases the second consonant of it undergoes assimilation
(which is optional) to the consonant of the next word.(117)(a)    ho:ṭo-kappo 'did not sleep' (kappo ‘to sleep’),     (b)    se ra:m a:wa:r-ke pa:ṭi/ho:ṭpa:ṭo (without assimilation)
            yesterday Ram house-to come-pt /not come-np
            ‘Yesterday Ram came home/ did not come home’   As can be seen above, in negative construction no tense marker is
used, while in positive construction tense marker is required. But it
can take aspectual marker -ḍa:n.(118)(a)    jo nene ma:nḍi ho:ṭcakni

"Consonants: Phonetically, besides the sounds listed below, another
sound has been recorded, which has not been included in the list,
that is, a glottal stop. It has been recorded in a couple of words like:
ca:n ~ ca?an ‘fish’, ba:y ~ ba?ay ‘today’, ha:n ~ ha?an ‘this’, to:l ~
to?ol ‘skin’, etc. But the same words have been recorded without
the glottal stop as well. So, as there is no contrastive pair available
8                             The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularybetween glottal vs. non-glottal sound, glottal stop has not been
posited for the speech form.","[18, 19]"

by –kini; waja-ki ‘due to/because of’, infinitival construction,
marked by –ka, and ghelya; gerundial construction, marked by -
ḍone; and temporal clauses marked by reduplicating the verb, etc.
Non-finite clauses are embedded within the main clause.(i) Participial construction, marked by –kini, khenṭo:(137)(a) jo / kama:ykini / enge bakko kha:nḍojere

"Vowels: The morphemes/words in this language have both
consonant endings as well as vowel endings. As such all the short
vowels can occur in all the positions, initially, medially and finally.",[26]
"3.9. Adverb(ial)s: The adverbs are those which normally modify a
verb in a sentence or construction. There are different types of
adverbs; like manner, time or temporal adverbs, place adverbs
which function more like nouns; and frequency adverbs. Most of
them are quite free in their occurrence. The following forms have
been found to be used in this function.(a) Manner adverbs: Though manner adverbs in this speech form
do not take any marker as such, still some of them take a form –ki
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                              95with them. Using it with adjectives, some adverbs are obtained.
Other than –ki, they are not morphologically marked. Only by the
place of their occurrence they are identified as such. They normally
occur preceding the main verb in a sentence. But they can occur
much before the verb, or even after a verb, as will be seen below.
Following are some of the manner adverbs.: geyra:-ki ‘slowly’,
jaldi-ki ‘fast’, masto-ki ‘nicely/beautifully’, jhaṭ-ka ‘all of a
sudden’, baro:bar ‘properly’, bageteka ‘silently’, marṭhay-ki ‘after
longtime’, etc.","[105, 106]"
"In the following ḍa:n is used as an aspectual marker with imne :    (e) eṭla a:wa:rki imne-ḍa:n

64                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyThere is another verb, a borrowed one, used for the verb ‘be’ hey,
very restrictively, in present tense in negative formation only. For
instance:
(86)(a) eṭey a:wa:rki hey-beṭhe
          he house-at be-neg
          ‘he is not at home’     (b) eṭey hinki hey beṭhe ḍa:n
         he here-at be –neg-pp
         ‘he was not here’     (c) parayki joppo hey-beṭhe
         river-in water be-neg
         ‘there is no water in the river’   As can be seen from the illustrations above, hey is used in
negative constructions with the negative form beṭhe. The positive
construction would be: parayki joppo imni ‘(there) is water in the
river’.jere(y) ‘happen’ is used as a regular verb to convert an active
sentence into an impersonal one. For instance:(87)(a) hiṭkella minja:rki tagojagṛa jerey
        they-between-obj quarrel happen
        ‘between them quarrel happened’     (b) uku:n ba:y a:ra kya:m a:ra uṭhwã-uṭhwã
         so today see tomorrow see like this gradually        meyna i:r-meyna jerey
        one month-two months passed
        ‘so seeing today seeing tomorrow just like this one - two
        months passed.’

         ‘by me this work cannot be done’.
         [be- < beṭhe : loss of second syllable, + assimilation]   A few verbs have varying forms between their imperative form
and in different tenses. For instance, the verb e:r- ‘to go’, in its
imperative form is eṛe; while in other tenses will have e:r-. (See

66                       The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyVerbless constructions, where adjectives like masto ‘good’, backa
‘small’, kemti ‘less’, etc. function as predicate adjectives.:(89)(a) jo masto ‘I (am) fine’ vs. jo masto beṭhe ‘I (am) not fine’     (b) himanso masto ‘this man (is) good’ (vs. masto manso ‘good
          man’ NP),     (c) enge a:wa:r backa ‘my house (is) small’ vs. (vs. backa
          a:wa:r ‘small house’ NP)     (d) eṭey u:nca ma:nso ‘he (is) tall person’ vs.
          eṭey ma:nso u:nca-(ka) ‘that person (is) tall’     (e) hipirjo kho:bo dima:g ‘this girl (is) very intelligent’  Even a noun can function as a predicate, in a possessive
construction, as in the following:(90)(a) ra:m-ki biḍi:-ka bakko
        ram-to one-only hand
        ‘ram (has) one-only hand’     (b) hi-pustak-kon da:m kemti
         this-book-pos price less
         ‘this book’s price (is) less’.","[74, 75, 76, 77]"
"   The above table gives an interesting view of the differences
between Korku and Nihali languages. In Nihali all are single
morphemes except for manta ‘people’ where –ta is a plural marker.
Also, the form caca:w, having initial CV repeated seems to be
144                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyproblematic. It could be a borrowing from Dravidian source. From
the above, it becomes clear that the basic forms are different in
these languages, though the method of obtaining compound kinship
terms is similar.","[154, 155]"
