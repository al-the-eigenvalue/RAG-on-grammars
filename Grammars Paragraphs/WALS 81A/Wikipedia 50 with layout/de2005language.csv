"           A brief examination of data from Apinajé, Suyá, Kayapó and Timbira may reveal the many differences (e.g. prenasalized stops, nominative case-marking in independent clauses) and similarities (e.g. simple morphology, SOV word order, ergative marking in subordinate clauses) existing among them. Panará, on the other hand, is dramatically distinct from the other languages of the branch. It displays a more polysynthetic morphological typology, with agent, patient and tense/aspect/modality (TAM) marking on the verb; ergative marking in independent clauses and SVO word order, among other things.18

     The area is known in Brazil as “Bico do Papagaio” (‘the parrot’s beak’).

   In an interview on this subject, an Apinajé speaker declared his total lack of familiarity with the latter
terms. Most interesting in this case would be to check on the word for ‘tip, corner’ in any of the Timbira
languages.

 Data examined are from Alves (2002), Timbira Apanjekrá; Reis Silva (2003) and Salanova (2001),
Mebengokre Kayapó; Santos (2004), Suyá; and Dourado (2001), Panará.

       The Apinajé are considered, in the anthropological literature, a Western divisionof the Timbira, living west of the Tocantins. Eastern Timbira peoples are thosedistributed at various locations in the States of Maranhão and Tocantins, east of the river(Nimuendajú 1983; Da Matta 1982). In linguistic classifications, on the other hand, it isnot uncommon for an Apinajé-Kayapó grouping to be contrasted with the Timbiradialectal cluster (Davis 1966; 1968). Be that as it may, the conclusion in both fields isthat the Apinajé constitute an autonomous group and language, distinct from bothKayapó and Timbira.","[41, 42]"
"       In the analysis of Apinajé, I share Matthew Dryer’s view that the grammaticalrelations of a language are specific to that language and may be defined according tolanguage internal criteria. In section 3.3 I have pointed out how distinct systems ofalignment interact in Apinajé. Thus, coding patterns and control properties relevant forthe establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé include:(82) Relevant criteria for the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé   (a) word order
   (b) person prefixes
   (c) independent pronouns
   (d) person inflection in imperative clauses
   (e) the use of reflexives
   (f) the occurrence of the realis marker in noun phrase coordination
   (g) switch-reference strategies
   (h) valency-changing operations
   (i) ergative marking in subordinate clauses
   (j) equi-deletion in complementation
   (k) coreferential deletion in coordination
       The SOV word order (criterion (a)) is fairly rigid in Apinajé and serves as a usefulcriterion of the identification of A and O. The use of person prefixes (b) reveals a split-

3.4.2. Equative predicates
                                                                                         244
Equative predicates functionally express a one-to-one identity relation between twospecific, referential entities, as in “I am Sam” or “I am your sister.” A structuraldifference between the juxtaposition construction employed here and the one expressingproper inclusion is that here a personal prefix on the predicate noun indicates thepossessor, and not the subject. The subject is encoded rather by a free pronoun, althoughits order relative to the mood marker remains reversed as compared to verbal clauses: thepronoun occurs clause-initially, and not in second position.(65) a. pa    na     a-prõ
       1      RLS    2-wife
       ‘I’m your wife.’
     b. ka    na    i-bje
        2     RLS   1-husband
       ‘You’re my husband.’
       Equative predicates by juxtaposition differ structurally from descriptive andverbal clauses primarily with respect to the relative order of the mood marker and thepronoun, and, specifically with respect to descriptives, because the prefix on thepredicator is not coreferential with the subject of the clause.","[257, 258]"
"Nonetheless, Apinajé morphology is more complex than it might seem at first, especiallywith respect to the major lexical categories of the language: Nouns, Verbs and

These word classes, especially Nouns and Verbs, are characterizedmorphologically by the presence of formatives, which are recurrent morphs that are eithersemantically empty or of elusive meaning, but which subcategorize words in formal orsemantic terms. The categories of nonfiniteness, person, and syntactic constituencyconstitute the core of inflectional morphology, the last applying to nouns, postpositions,and verbs. Verbs are subcategorized morphosyntactically into transitives, intransitivesand descriptives, displaying a split intransitivity system with respect to verbal person-marking. Word order is predominantly SOV. Syntactically complex constructionsinclude verb serialization and clause subordination, with ergative case-marking acharacteristic of subordinate clauses.

"       The Apinajé grammatical word can be identified according to some of the criterialisted in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19-25). First, the grammatical word is internallycohesive, both formally, since its components constitute a bound unit; and semantically,because that unit conveys a conventionalized meaning. Secondly, the component
                                                                                              92
morphemes of a grammatical word in Apinajé follow a particular order, with word cliticsalways occupying the outermost final position in the word, thus indicating the word finalboundary, and person prefixes appearing in first position, when applicable, thusindicating the word-initial boundary. Thirdly, speakers generally utter the word withoutinterruptions or pauses, except in case of hesitations, clarifications or factors of this sort,which are part of natural speech in any language. Finally, the Apinajé grammatical wordcan constitute a complete utterance by itself.","[105, 106]"
"Their list is as follows:
        A grammatical word consists of a number of grammatical elements which:
              (a) always occur together, rather than scattered through the clause (the
                  criterion of cohesiveness);
              (b) occur in a fixed order;
              (c) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning. (...)
              (d) Morphological processes involved in the formation of words tend to be
                  non-recursive. That is, one element will not appear twice in a word. (...)
              (e) There will be just one inflectional affix per word. (...)
              (f) A speaker may pause between words but not within a word. (...)
              (g) A word may constitute a complete utterance, all by itself (Dixon and
                  Aikhenvald 2002:19-25).",[102]
"       Distributional criteria include (a) the relative order of elements inside theconstituent and (b) the distribution of the constituent in the sentence, along with (c) thedistribution of overt indices of constituent internal cohesion and boundaries.",[212]

4.1. Person markingFirst, examples (83-84) illustrate the use of person prefixes. In finite verb forms O andsome S are morphologically marked in the verbal stem (83). In nonfinite verb forms, all Sand O participants are marked by prefixes (84).

As a complement to this morebasic health service, a physician visits the villages every two weeks in order to providemore detailed medical examination. Patients suffering from serious illnesses are sent tourban centers for medical attention.",[36]
"Additionally, the definite marker ja must occur at the end boundary of the clause, beingoptionally preceded by the agent nominalizer cw, which occurs most often (though notstrictly) with verbs of action or activity. The order of elements remains basically thesame as in simple clauses.",[295]

"       Finally, the adverbial notion of a temporal negative, ‘never’, involves the co-occurrence of the generic negative marker ket with what could be analyzed as a temporalcomponent, a, glossed here as ‘ever’. Together, a...ket form what could be describedstructurally as a “circumclitic”. The temporal marker precedes the element under thescope of negation, and the negative marker ket follows it, occupying the constituent finalposition, as expected.

4. Grammatical relationsKeenan (1976) proposes a set of criteria, which may apply to different languages to agreater or lesser extent, for a definition of Subject as a universal category. The idea ofgrammatical relations as a universal category has been questioned by Dryer (1997), who
                                                                                              254
points out that, while a set of criteria may be helpful to establish what similarities thereare amongst languages, these similarities do not explain why languages are the way theyare. Any similarities are, he claims, the reflexes of functional and cognitive processeswhich themselves may be universal. Thus, it is not grammatical relations as such that areuniversal. Each language displays its own relevant grammatical relations, which may ormay not coincide with the notions of “Subject” and “Object” as found in other languages.","[267, 268]"
"
3.4.1. Proper inclusion predicatesFunctionally, proper inclusion predicates indicate the membership of a given entity into ageneral class, as in “I am a teacher.” In Apinajé, a juxtaposition construction expressing
                                                                                         243
this kind of predication does not require the presence of a free pronoun for the expressionof the subject. Here, the person prefix attached to the predicate noun is what indicates thesubject, regardless of whether a pronoun also occurs. Should a pronoun be included inthe clause, it would appear preceding the modality marker and agreeing with the prefix,as illustrated in the elicited examples presented below.
(64) a. pa          na         i-di
       1            RLS        1-woman
       ‘I’m a woman.’     b. ka           na        a-b
        2            RLS       2-man
       ‘You’re a man.’     c. ja     na      Ø-wap
        DEM RLS        3-knife
       ‘This is a knife.’
       This construction type then differs structurally from verbal clauses and descriptivepredicates because of the potential absence of the independent pronoun, and the reversedrelative order of the mood marker and the pronoun when one occurs at all. In addition, itis specifically distinct from descriptive predicate constructions in that, even thoughpronominal prefixes refer to the subject in both, in the nominal predicate construction theprefix structurally encodes the subject, rather just than agreeing with it.","[256, 257]"
"       If Direct Object in Apinajé is not particularly robust, the evidence in favor of thegrammatical relation Indirect Object is limited to a single criterion: obligatoriness. In thetraditional ditransitive predicates, the third argument bears the dative case-marking, andin the various noncanonical verb types seen in section 3.3.2, the second argument bearsone of four different case-markers, lexically determined by the verb. Thus, the categoryof Indirect Object could be defined as those obligatory arguments that otherwise have nomorphological or syntactic patterns to unite them.

          The criteria listed above for subjects are further discussed and illustrated in thenext sections.","[269, 270]"
"        While it is true that the sequence aw- occurs mostly with transitive stemsbeginning in /a/, its distribution is not so limited. Aw- also appears on two consonant-initial bases: the descriptive stems kagr ‘be hot’ and r ‘be long’. The other descriptivestem with which aw- occurs is akr ‘cold’. The semantics of aw- in these forms appearsto conform to that observed in transitive stems, i.e. the patient — here the sole argument— takes generic or impersonal semantics. If, on the one hand, each morpheme a- and u-has its own particular function, on the other, they must occur in combination in order to
                                                                                         133
convey the meaning observed in the examples, the nonfinite formal changesnotwithstanding.","[146, 147]"
"
Ku- Verb Stems. Ku- verbs constitute a morphological class only, since the semanticsthat unites verbs in this set is opaque. In general, though, the semantics characteristic ofthe ku- verb set seems to focus on movement or direct contact against a surface. Forinstance, in order to wash a firm object, such as a table or one’s body, one might think ofrubbing a brush or soap against the surface of that object; in the seemingly moreproblematic case of kukw ‘break hard-shelled nuts’, as compared with kakw ‘dig;poke’, the action again affects the surface of the item being broken, and so on. Ku- verbsare mostly transitives (although there are a few exceptions), and they do not display anystructural idiosyncrasies.

         kukw      ‘break hard-shell nuts’       kakw          ‘dig; poke’
       The fact that there are ka- counterparts to some ku- verbs is worthy of notice, as itgives us some indication of the semantics of the class. A hypothesis about the formativeku- is that it may have started out as the third person prefix (section 4.1.1), which
                                                                                         125
eventually got reanalysed as part of the stem. If that is true, then the semantic value ofthe ku- stems would be the same as the very root that served as a base, whereas the ka-stem would change based on the addition of the meaning of ka- as a derivationalmorpheme.","[137, 138, 139]"

3.1. Lexical categoriesThe categories Noun, Verb and Postposition share inflectional properties. The same setof person prefixes is employed in the expression of possession, grammatical relations,and postpositional objects. In rare instances, Nouns and Verbs may even display thesame derivational morphology. The fluidity that exists among Nouns and Verbs is alsonoticeable in conversion, fairly common in the language. The similarities between eachof these classes and Postpositions is indicative of the diachronic sources of postpositions.",[120]

It indicates ametaphorical transition from a previous stage to a new one: from life to death, fromappearance to disappearance, from green to ripe.(21)    ka     na     ka      ra     ic-pe a-pikudr                        mõ

        Compared to (20.b) and (21-22), it is possible to note that similar constructionsinvolving position verbs focus more on the activity being performed, ‘cry’, ‘fasten’,‘dance’ (23), rather than the result accomplished after the activity has been concluded.

         (I.e. ‘It is you who are dancing.’)
        Not all movement verbs are eligible for appearing in this construction type, asthey yield literal rather than grammatical meanings. Thus, the verb te ‘go’ in (24.a)indicates the actual movement of the participant as s/he fastens the wood sticks; that is,
                                                                                             295
there are two simultaneous actions going on. Comparatively, the examples in (24.b),involving the dative postposition m in place of the morpheme , indicates literalmovement towards the locus of an action.

       ‘No, I’m headed that way to fasten my dry wood.’
       Some alternative hypotheses are possible for the analysis of the morpheme  inthis context, since this marker appears in various positions with distinct meanings, in thegrammar of the language. One hypothesis could be that  is the instrumental postpositionin the examples above, and that would even justify the nonfiniteness of the precedingverb; after all, in order for it to be the object of a postposition, it must be more nominalthan verbal – and that is what nonfinite verb forms are, in Apinajé.","[307, 308, 309]"
"        The nineteenth century thus marks the beginning of intensified contact betweenthe Apinajé and the national society and the progressive occupation of Apinajé territory,
Pederneiras in order to snatch their work tools (Nimuendajú 1983: 2).
                                                                                          15
which continued in the first half of the twentieth century. Despite its generally non-conflictive nature, the contact would prove detrimental to the Apinajé, as reflected inmajor population reduction, followed by complete disregard for their land rights on thepart of well-established farmers.","[28, 29]"
"         Example (16.b) is more complex in that the first event of the sequence consists oftwo clauses – i.e. two minor events: the wait for the potatoes to cook, and the cooking ofthe potatoes. Within that domain, the subjects of the first and second events are distinct,
                                                                                           290
thus the different-subject third person conjunction occurs in the second clause. Althoughthere is no structural evidence of subordination between the clauses expressing the firstand second events, the ‘cook’ clause stands in a complement-type relation with the ‘wait’clause, albeit semantically. For the purposes of the construction being described in thepresent section, those two clauses are taken here as if constituting a unit.

         The second possibility (‘before SBJ X, SBJ will Y’) includes the negative markerket. Here, the order of the clauses is reversed in the sentence: the first clause encodes theevent that should happen last in the sequence; the particle ri occurs postposed to thisclause and the negator ket modifies its predicate.

Personprefixes encode first, second, and third persons, that refer to the objects of Postpositions,the possessor in Nouns, and the absolutive arguments of Verbs. There are three thirdperson prefixes: ku-, i- and Ø-. The zero prefix is the only one used with all three wordclasses. The prefix ku- occurs exclusively with transitive verbs (there is one instance ofku- with a postposition) and the prefix i-, very marginally, with nouns. The accusativeprefix ku- has further distributional restrictions: it occurs exclusively with the finite form
                                                                                         181
of verbs, only in monosyllabic stems, and is employed when the accusative noun phraseis not contiguous to the verb, but elsewhere in the clause (section IV.2.3).","[194, 195]"
"       On the other hand, Direct Object is a less robust grammatical relation in thelanguage. The O argument forms a tight constituent with the following verb, and if the Odoes not occur as a free form, then a personal prefix on the verb must index the person ofO. In addition to this morphosyntactic pattern, the accusative prefix set contains a uniqueform, the prefix ku-, which is the one criterion that unquestionably identifies the DirectObject. Note that these criteria only identify the canonical O as Direct Object, leaving nosyntactic or morphological evidence for the combination of the canonical O category withthe many proposed noncanonical O arguments: these latter bear case-markers, cannot beindexed on the verb, and show no evidence of constituency with the V. As such, we pushthem to the next category, that of Indirect Object.",[269]

"       Dixon and Aikhenvald call attention to the fact that a phonological word – or, theword as defined by its phonological properties – in a given language, may or may notcoincide with a grammatical word in the same language. Thus, a grammatical word mayconsist of more than one phonological word or, likewise, a phonological word mayconsist of more than one grammatical word. In the first case, they cite the example ofYimas (Foley 1991: 86, cited in Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002), in which compounds(grammatical words) are composed of more than one phonological word (theparticipating nouns), in that they bear individual primary stresses. As an illustration ofthe second case, they cite examples of one positional clitic in Dyirbal (p. 27-28).",[103]
"       In contrast, the search for syntactic properties that distinguish the categories ofDirect Object and Indirect Object was unsuccessful, leaving a potentially interesting topicfor future research.

IntroductionThe present chapter discusses those construction types that encompass more than onepredicator within a single syntactic unit. Arguments are typically shared, but that may notnecessarily be the case. In functional terms, what I will be discussing here are thedomains of (a) complementation, understood, in the sense of Noonan (1985), as acomplex structure involving a clause that serves as argument of a matrix verb; (b)relativization, a clause that serves as modifier of a head noun, thus belonging within anoun phrase; (c) adverbial clauses, those expressing contextual or circumstantialinformation that serves as a frame for the main event described by the matrix verb, that is,clauses that modify a verb phrase or clause; (d) constructions expressing aspectualmeanings, such as the inchoative, the progressive, and the continuous; and (e) thecomparative of superiority. Causative constructions, discussed in section IV.5.2, alsoconstitute one type of complex construction in Apinajé, since they are expressed by thetypes of syntactic strategies described here.","[286, 287]"

Verbs. The nominative argument of a simple verbal clause controls reflexivization andreciprocity. One target of reflexivization is the direct object of a transitive clause. In thiscase, the reflexive marker ami occupies the direct object position slot in the verb phrase,in which case the verb may take a relational prefix if vowel initial. Compare theexamples (a-b) below.

           The reciprocal marker has the same distribution in the verb phrase as the reflexivemarker; likewise, it may target the accusative argument of a transitive clause. However,at least at the semantic level, the reciprocal marks both the subject relation, whichcontrols the process, and the object relation, which is the target, since the reciprocalrelation must include at least two referents.

           In bitransitive clauses, an oblique participant may also be a target of eitherreflexivization and reciprocity.","[188, 189]"

The study is based on originaldata collected by the author in various trips to the field between October 1995 andAugust 2000, as well as in interviews with speakers of the language in the city ofGoiânia, Goiás State, Brazil. Rather than a definite account of the language, this work isintended as the kernel of what will evolve into a more comprehensive grammar as furtheranalysis is conducted; for the time being, my main goal is to lay out as many patterns ascan possibly be distilled from the available data, regarding the phonology, morphology,lexicon, and syntax of the language. From a broader perspective, I hope this study willserve as an effective source for historical-comparative work aiming at the reconstructionof the Jê linguistic family, and thus constitute an additional piece for the betterunderstanding of the Macro-Jê stock, a still hypothetical classification for a number oflittle-documented South American languages.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"          The nominalizer of instrument or location c is used with transitive, intransitive,and descriptive verbs. The absolutive argument of the base verb may be expressed as thepossessor of the resulting noun (41.a); bases beginning in a vowel must take the relationalprefix.

            cover=NMLZ.INSTR          The nominalizer cw applies to transitive and intransitive verbs. Nouns derivedby it designate agents regardless of the valency of the base verb; the accusative argumentof a transitive base is usually present, and the agent is typically understood asreferential/definite. There may be incorporation of the base-verb object into the newlyformed lexeme (42.b).(42) a. br=cw                         ‘hunter’

          The morpheme cw is also employed in nominalizations involving the genitivepostposition õ. The clitic encodes what would be the possessum in this genitive-likeconstruction (43).

In all above cases, primary word stress falls on the nominalizer.","[125, 126, 127]"
"        The main morphological criterion to be considered is the use of relational prefixes(section III.4.1.2), which are precisely the overt grammatical marking of phrasalconstituency in Jê (and other Macro-Jê) languages. Relational prefixes are common tonoun, verb, and postpositional phrases, and indicate contiguity between the head of aphrase and its dependent. Such contiguity is one of the clues for the constituency relationbetween the elements, and a violation of this state of affairs has overt grammaticalrepercussions as well, such as the use of specific person prefixes for head marking(section 2.3). Even though the relational prefix strategy indicates the bond between two-word units, and thus would not seem as useful for larger units, it may reccur in sequencesof more than two words thus indicating relevant constituency relations among the unitsthat participate in the hierarchy (provided the elements involved are vowel-initial).
                                                                                             198
       While relational prefixes are indicative of constituent internal cohesion, othermorphological devices delimit the initial and final boundaries of certain types of (phrasaland clausal) constituents. These devices include (a) nonfiniteness suffixes, (b) ergativeclitics, (c) nominalizers and (d) determiners, like the definite article ja. Most of thesemarkers pertain to subordination, and the roles they perform in such contexts arediscussed in chapter V. With respect to constituency, however, positional clitics (b-d)overtly set the boundaries for clausal constituents.","[211, 212]"

"Finally, echo-vowels also serve as an index of final word boundary. A more detaileddiscussion of the phonological word in Apinajé is provided in the next chapter, where thisnotion is contrasted to that of grammatical word.

IntroductionFor the unacquainted observer, Apinajé may appear as a morphologically plain languageof the analytic kind, consisting of rather short words, and having much of its grammaticalcategories expressed by function words rather than bound morphemes. That impressionis justified: Apinajé morphemes are monosyllabic indeed, and the grammaticalcategories found in the language are often expressed by function words that may or maynot be phonologically dependent, or by syntactic constructions that often times employ asubset of these very function words.","[94, 95]"
"1.   Morphological units1.1. RootsApinajé roots are monosyllabic, bear stress and may come in any of the syllable typesavailable in the language, namely, V(C), CV(C), CCV(C) or CCCV(C). Some roots may

constitute words on their own, while others serve as the base for morphologicallycomplex stems, such as compounds and derived lexemes. Compounds consit of morethan one root (2.a), and may include derivational morphology as well (2.b). Derivationalmorphemes may be clitics or affixes attaching to the root (3). Roots may also comeaccompanied by formatives, constituting another kind of morphologically complex stem(4).(1)       bra                                ‘walk, stroll; wake O up’

 Relational Prefixes (RP) are part of the inflectional system of Apinajé. These morphemes occur
pervasively in vowel-initial nouns, verbs and postpositions of Apinajé. See details in section 4.1.2. below.

          õpt                             ‘roll end over end; tumble’
1.2. AffixesInflectional and derivational affixes are often monosyllabic morphemes whose structureis restricted to the V(C) and CV(C) syllable patterns. Certain inflectional affixes mayconsist of a single consonant, as is the case with relational prefixes and nonfinitenesssuffixes (sections 4.1.2. and 4.1.3.). Affixes do not display any particular stressproperties in Apinajé; they simply contribute segmental material to the phonologicalword, submitting to the overall stress rule applicable to that word. The verb pi ‘kill’ isinflected for person in (5). The finite form of the verb is shown in (a), and its nonfiniteform in (b).
(5) a. ic-pi                  [ic pi]            ‘kill me’
       a-pi                   [a pi]             ‘kill you’
       ku-pi                  [gu pi]            ‘kill it’      b. ic-pi-r              [ic pi ]           ‘kill me’
                                                                                                            85
         a-pi-r                     [a pi ]          ‘kill you’
         Ø-pi-r                     [ pi ]           ‘kill it’
         Formatives display the same structural properties as affixes, certainly becausethey too were affixes at an earlier stage in the development of the language. For instance,it is possible to identify personal prefixes that have been reanalyzed as part of somestems, which take productive inflectional morphology at the synchronic level (6).
(6) a. kupe                          [gu pe]           ‘touch’                     < ku- ‘3’
       a-kupe                        [agu pe]          ‘touch on you’    b. ipok                          [i pogo]        ‘core’                  < i- ‘3’
       pr n-ipok ri                 [ p ni pog ri] ‘in the core of the forest’1.3. CliticsClitics may be of three kinds: positional clitics, phrasal clitics and word clitics, all ofwhich display specific stress properties and, like the roots, may come in any of thesyllable patterns available. Positional clitics occupy specific slots in the structure of theclause, and they usually encode grammatical categories that pertain to the proposition asa whole, such as mood, tense, aspect and the like (7). Few phrasal clitics indicate theinitial boundary of a phrase; the tendency is for them to occur phrase finally (8). Thesame is true of word clitics, except that their structural domain is restricted to the(grammatical) word (9).2

 As mentioned in footnote 3 of chapter II, throughout this dissertation I will use the symbol “=” to indicate
clitic boundaries, but only in the case of word clitics. Positional (phrase and clause) clitics will be simply

2.     WordIn any language, words can be characterized in terms of phonological and grammaticalproperties, which constitute independent criterial dimensions. One general definition ofthe phonological word is provided in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) as follows:
          A phonological word is a phonological unit larger than the syllable (in some
          languages it may minimally be just one syllable) which has at least one (and
          generally more than one) phonological defining property chosen from the
          following areas:and occupy predictable positions in clauses and phrases.
                                                                                                88
               (a) Segmental features – internal syllabic and segmental structure;
                  phonetic realisations in terms of this; word boundary phenomena; pause
                  phenomena.
               (b) Prosodic features – stress (or accent) and/or tone assignment; prosodic
                  features such as nasalization, retroflexion, vowel harmony.
               (c) Phonological rules – some rules apply only within a phonological
                  word; others (external sandhi rules) apply specifically across a word
                  boundary.
         Note that there is likely to be a close interaction between these types of features
         (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 13).","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102]"
"        Apinajé cosmology, social and physical organization is permeated by thisdualism, which is not as much hierarchical as it is dialectic. This may be observed in theApinajé creation myth, according to which all things existing on Earth were created bySun and Moon. Sun, the older character, is the initiator, the one who poses a particular,harmonic state of affairs. Moon, the younger character, is the antithetical element, theone who questions the order and brings chaos into the status quo. The result of thisinteraction is a thesis that justifies the dual aspect of all creation in both nature andculture. Thus, animals, colors, name sets, ceremonial roles, among other things, aredivided in pairs which are directly associated with either one or the other mythicalcharacter; and the members of each pair stand in a kind of inalienable relationship, for theexistence of one is only justifiable by the existence of the other (Text I, Appendix B).

           Kolti and Kolre, the most relevant pair of moieties of Apinajé social organization,are associated to Sun and Moon, respectively. The village layout and, with it, thedistribution of marriage groups and formal friends, is guided by this affiliation.","[17, 18]"

Thus, a plain transitiveclause must include A and O; a ditransitive clause must include A, O and a third argument,which may be expressed morphosyntactically as an indirect object E or as a secondaryobject O; a plain intransitive has its single argument S; and an extended intransitive hastwo obligatory arguments: S plus another, E, which is typically expressed with obliquemarkers. Extended arguments differ from oblique participants or adjuncts in that they areobligatorily required by the verb.",[245]
"        Paratactic clauses are finite, displaying the very same structure as independentsimple clauses. Parataxis may require the same-subject or different-subject switch-reference markers, where pertinent, and it often involves morphemes from the TAM cliticinventory.",[289]
"
1.   ComplementationThe examples of complementation existing in my database consist of clausalcomplements occupying positions other than that of a sentence subject. Additionally, theoverwhelming majority of complement-taking predicators are of the noncanonicalmarking type, most often involving the use of the dative postposition m. These may bemere coincidences; however, there has been at least one instance in which I tried to elicita sentence that included a clausal complement in subject position, and speakers offeredparatactic clauses, instead.
                                                                                              277
       As already mentioned, the use of subordination for the expression ofcomplementation requires that the subordinate verb be in its nonfinite form. Thesubordinate clause occupies some position between the matrix verb, which occurs in finalposition, and the positional clitics normally occupying sentence-initial position. Sincethe complement-taking verbs noted all involve the use of a postposition for marking oneof the core arguments (which could be either A or O, depending on the verb), it is oftenthe case that the clausal complement will be immediately preceded by this case marker,when A is the noncanonically marked argument.","[290, 291]"
"That is so because b is the second argument of the verb are, and accordingly, it occursimmediately preposed to the verb, which takes the relational prefix; the same is true of di‘woman’ in (6.c), the S argument of the verb ca ‘stand’. In (6.c-d), on the other hand, therelativized element di ‘woman’ is the A argument of are ‘tell’. The external relativestrategy applies in this case, with the restrictive clause following the head noun. Notice in(6.d) the presence of the third person ergative marker kt inside the subordinate clause;the ergative case marker is coreferential with the external head noun and serves as aresumptive pronoun.

        The examples in (7-9) further illustrate the point. In (8), the relativized element isthe dative participant, which also occurs internally in the relative clause. Thus theinstances in which externally headed relative clauses occur include mostly cases ofergative relativization, but are not limited to this. For instance, consider (9.b), where thesecond argument of the verb, mekdc ‘medication’, appears in initial position in thesentence. Inside the relative clause, the subordinate verb appears without the relationalprefix, since its object is not contiguous to it. Examples of this kind were not veryfrequent during elicitation sessions. It is possible that this fronting of the object of the RCis a pragmatic strategy for placing it under focus, in which case this construction wouldbe more marked than those in which the relativized object occurs internal to the relativeclause. It is also possible that this is all artefacts of elicitation; further (textual) examplesare still needed for clarification of this point.

         Strategies for case-recovery in Apinajé relativization are the use of resumptivepronouns, which are zero in many cases, but which may also come attached to theergative marker (or expressed by its suppletive form, in the case of the third person).","[296, 297, 298]"
"        The next set of patterns could be analyzed in two different ways: either theypresent a noncanonical O or they present formally intransitive predicates with anobligatory oblique argument (E) instead of an O. In favor of the former analysis is theobligatory nature of the second argument. In favor of the latter analysis is the fact that theputative A for some verbs follows the standard A/SA pattern (unmarked, clause-initial);but for other verbs, it follows the pattern for subjects of descriptives (clause-initialnominative pronoun, SO verbal prefix).",[251]

2.2. Postpositional phraseThe structure of postpositional phrases is quite consistent regardless of themorphosyntactic properties of the noun phrases involved. Vowel-initial postpositionsrequire relational prefixes, as usual. Objects of postpositions may be simplex nounphrases, coordinated noun phrases and nonfinite clauses (22-24).

        Complex noun phrases, namely, those including relative clauses, may havepostpositions but are not directly headed by the postposition; in these cases, a person

Of the determiners found in noun phrases, only demonstrative pronounsmay replace the noun phrase headed by a postposition. Otherwise, in the absence of afull noun phrase, it is a person prefix or the reflexive or reciprocal clitics that attach to thepostposition, serving as cross-reference markers (26).

Quantifiers. The plural and dual clitics may each co-occur with a postposition that isinflected for person. In this case, the quantifier clitic is actually modifying the (referentof the) person prefix attached to the postposition, and occurs preposed to it. Mostpostpositions take a zero prefix for third person; others have irregular third person forms(see diachronic hypothesis in section III.3.1.3). In these cases, the quantifier occurspreposed to the postposition itself (27).
                                                                                           216(27) a. me     Ø-kot                          ‘after them’

Clausal objects. A few select postpositions may perform a more grammatical functionwhen taking a clause as their objects. One such example is the dative postposition m,which may encode notions of future or purpose action as illustrated in (28).

Postpositional phrase coordination. The coordination of postpositional phrases seemsmore restricted in possibilities than plain noun phrase coordination. The conjunctionused is the associative marker me. The examples in (29) show structural distinctions thathave to do with whether one of the coordinates is a speech-act participant. If so, it will beexpressed as a person prefix on the postposition, which results in non-contiguity betweenthe (notional) coordinates, since the two nominal elements are separated by the
                                                                                              217
associative and the dual marker (29.a). That is not exactly what could be calledcoordination, though the combination of dual marker and first person prefix encodes firstperson exclusive, and the other participant is clearly indicated by the associative markerme. In (29.b), on the other hand, the two third person objects are expressed by overt nounphrases linked by the associative marker.

          [Lit.: ‘Sirac, towards the village and the field, in both places she lives/wanders.’]
          The unacceptable examples in (30) show that the presence of the dual marker wais necessary, and that it mediates the relation between the coordinate noun phrases andthe postposition that heads the higher phrase. In other words, there is no coordination ofpostpositional phrases as such; instead, there is either noun phrase or clause coordination(31).

2.3. Verb phraseVerbs phrases in Apinajé follow an absolutive pattern with regard to which argumentcooccurs with the verb inside the phrase. That is predictable according to themorphosyntactic class of the predicator that heads the phrase – either (di)transitive ordescriptive (32-34). Verb phrases headed by intransitive verbs do not include any type ofnoun phrase, in main clauses. In dependent clauses, they follow the same pattern asdescriptives, that is, they have their S argument overtly expressed in the verb phrase (34).","[228, 229, 230, 231, 232]"
"
3.1.3. PostpositionsPostpositions constitute a (rather large) closed class in Apinajé. Postpositions occurpostposed to their object noun phrase or, in the absence of an overt dependent nounphrase, they inflect for person in the same way as Verbs and Nouns. The set of personprefixes used is the same for all three lexical categories, as is the complementarydistribution between prefixes and noun phrases.",[153]

       Compound nouns also result from the noun-verb combination. Here, the verbalelement involved is often a descriptive verb (32.a) or some nonfinite verb form (32.b).

Noun-Noun-Verb Stems. Compounds consisting of one verbal element and more thanone nominal element may display distinct internal structuring. In (33.a), the phrase tjapje ‘long leg’ characterizes pu ‘bug’, as does the augmentative clitic ti. In (33.b), kratk ‘waist cover’ displays genitive organization, being modified by r. The same overallstress rules apply regardless of internal structuring patterns, however.

Noun-Postposition-Noun Stem. Some compounds consist of a postpositional phrase-likeconstruction which is subordinated to a nominal element. In this context, the groupheaded by the dative postposition indicates purpose.(34)    d=m=kc                          ‘eyeglasses’

Verb-Postposition Stem. Transitive verbs can result from compounding that involves averb and a postposition, in a very peculiar construction: from a strictly distributionalperspective, the verb is apparently subordinated to the postposition; however, the verbform is finite (35).(35)     ca=                               ‘wait for O’

3.   Word classesThe present section is about the content and function words of Apinajé: how theycategorize and how this categorization is expressed in structural terms, among otherthings. The discussion is organized in terms of lexical categories and grammaticalcategories. Lexical categories include nouns, verbs, postpositions and adverbials –mostly open classes (section 3.1). Grammatical categories are pronouns and clitics thatencode various grammatical meanings – words that consitute closed classes (section 3.2).","[117, 118, 119, 120]"
        The fact that these units are prominent within their respective constituents mightbe one reason why these function words – and not others – tend to display echo-vowels.,[93]
"           The phoneme /s/ has been noted also in variations of an Apinajé kinship term: si‘female.vocative’, sir , sisi. Other than that, /s/ appears more often in words borrowedfrom Portuguese. In words other than Portuguese borrowings, the alveolar fricative /s/occurs at syllable onset, in word initial and medial positions.
(39) a. /k set/                     [k set]                  ‘Apinajé proper name (male)’
     b./sisi/                       [sisi]                   ‘FEM.VOC’

    One Apinajé proper name which includes the phoneme /s/ is K set.
                                                                                            57
The labiodental fricative /f/ is a phoneme borrowed from Portuguese, whose occurrencein Apinajé is limited to loan words. In spite of that, /f/ is also subject to the voicealternation typical of Apinajé obstruents, especially in the context of sonorants (40.b).
(40) a. /famas/                 [famajs]               ‘pharmacy’
     b./fuwnio  /              [fuwnjo ]           ‘Fulniô (nickname)’
                                [vuwnjo ]
1.1.3. Approximant phonemesFlap. The alveolar flap // is realized by the allophones [], [], [] and [l]. The phonememay occupy syllable onset and coda, occurring in initial, medial and final positions in theword. The retroflex allophone [] appears in syllable onset word medially, and in syllablecoda word finally. At word boundary, there is fluctuation between the retroflexed flapand lateral allophones [, ]. The retroflex flap is in free variation with its non-retroflexcounterpart [], which occurs in all other environments (41-42).
(41) a. /go=at/              [goadi]            ‘river’

                                [ga ]
                                                                                             58(42) a. /pu/                  [puu]                ‘garden’
                               [puu]
                               [puu]     b./a /                  [a ]                ‘division; limits’

                               [a ]
       The non-retroflexed lateral allophone [l] is used word initially in emphatic speech.","[70, 71, 72]"

       The dissertation is a preliminary grammatical description of the language spokenby the Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. It discusses the corefacts about Apinajé phonology, morphology and syntax from a functional-typlogicalperspective, and provides three appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of textsand a preliminary dictionary. The phonological analysis proposes an alternativeinterpretation for the inventory of phonemes as compared to earlier analyses, pointing tophonemic distinctions not previously noted, which might lead to interesting findingsregarding the historical development of the language. Apinajé morphemes are typicallymonosyllabic and the language makes ample use of function words for the expression ofgrammatical categories, properties that are characteristic of analytic languages.","[1, 2, 3, 4]"
"        The fact that Postposition is viewed here as a lexical category might seem at oddswith the fact that postpositions are function words. However, even though a clear set ofstandard postpositions (monosyllabic, high frequency of use, with more grammatical thanlexical meaning) does exist in the language, other members of this category seem morelike postpositions-in-the-making, evolving from a class of nouns that I will term here“relator nouns.” For that reason, it is almost innaccurate to speak of postpositions inApinajé as constituting a closed class; perhaps this might be best described as a “halfwayopen” class.",[153]
"         Other denominations found in reports from previous centuries include Afotigés,Uhitische, Utonsché, Otogé, and Aogé (Villa Real 1891 [1793], Pohl 1932, Marques1870, Mattos 1875, cited in Nimuendajú 1983). Curt Nimuendajú suggests that the latterterms derive from the word ôd, ôdo ‘tip; corner’, and points out that the variants Hôti andAhôtiyê used to be employed by the Eastern Timbira to refer to the Apinajé. He furtherspeculates that the terms may have been a reference to the corner formed at the

  This word is also spelled as “Apinayé” in the literature, as first introduced by Curt Nimuendajú. Variants
of the term are Pinarés, Pinajés and Oupinagees.

confluence of the Tocantins and Araguaia Rivers in the north,16 traditional Apinajéterritory (Nimuendajú 1983).17 2.1. Genetic affiliation Apinajé is classified as a Northern Jê language, along with Panará, Suyá, Kayapó, and Timbira. Other branches of the family are Central Jê, which includes the Akwe languages (Xavante and Xerente) and Southern Jê, consisting of Kaingáng and Xokléng.","[40, 41]"
"
3.2.2.6.Reflexive and ReciprocalReflexive and reciprocal markers are word proclitics. They have the same distribution asperson prefixes in any of the lexical classes Noun, Verb and Postposition. Unlike personprefixes, however, reflexive and reciprocal clitics carry stress, thus forming a
                                                                                           174
phonological word on their own. Together with the stem, the clitics form what I havebeen calling a phonological phrase that is equivalent to a grammatical word.","[187, 188]"
