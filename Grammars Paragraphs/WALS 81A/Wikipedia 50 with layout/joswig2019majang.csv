III.2.2.1 Constituent order in main clauses
Dimmendaal (1998a, p. 66) reconstructs Proto-Surmic as probably showing
a verb-second order of constituents, which was changed in the Didinga-
Murle group to VAP via language contact from neighboring VAP-type
languages such as Toposa, Nyangatom and Turkana. This is contrary to
Unseth (1986b, p. 140), who analyzed Proto-Surmic as a verb-initial lan-
guage. Indeed, in a Majang clause where the constituents A, verb and P are
overtly expressed, they frequently appear in the following order:
        Verb – Subject – Object
Examples showing this order can easily be gleaned through elicitation:
Example III.17: basic constituent order VAP
   a) ɓokotù jàrtíL nàːkɛ ɗɛpɛL.
      ɓokot-í jàrtíL              nàːk-ɛ       ɗɛpɛL
      kill-3S.DJ woman\SG.ERG.MOD POSS\1S.SG-ERG   lion\SG.ABS
      My woman kills a lion.
   b) kàwɛ wàr àdùre.
      kàw-ɛ       wàr       àdùre
      bite-3S.DJ dog\SG.ERG   cat\SG.ABS
      A dog bites a cat.
VAP is invariably the order of constituents when eliciting transitive clauses.
A Majang grammar entirely based on elicitation is unlikely to encounter any
other word order. But when looking at natural texts, it is by no means the
most frequent display of constituents in Majang. The only main-clause ex-
ample of VAP in my narrative corpus is the following:
                          Case Marking on Central Constituents                  127Example III.18: basic constituent order VAP in a main clause in natural discourse

      see-3S.DJ Waalook\ERG path\SG.ABS house\SG.ABS Leer-POSS
      Then, one day, Waalook saw the path to Leer’s house.
This clause is the first clause of a new episode in the narrative, with a change
of time and place, and the need to re-establish the discourse status of partici-
pants. This is also the only main-clause example in my corpus with an erga-
tive lexical NP. Another rare example of VAP is the following subordinate
clause42:
Example III.19: basic constituent order VAP in a subordinate clause
      àgútL cìnɔ̀ kánL ɓòkòtìːɗ ɗúŋéL cìnɛ càːkómL nɛːkík,

      DEM-SG-HR    friend\SG.ABS POSS.3S.ABS=SUB
      because that hyena had killed his friend,
In this example background information is provided in an almost thetical
setting. As is shown in section V.9.1, the A or S is usually not overtly shown
in a clause if referring to an already activated participant. VAP is in fact a
very infrequent constituent structure, mostly used in thetical clauses lacking
any information accessible from the preceding context (which is what eli-
cited sentences tend to be). This matches what Du Bois (2003, p. 48) calls
preferred argument structure, about which he claims that speakers “freely
realize full lexical noun phrases in intransitive subject position or transitive
object position, but strongly avoid placing them in transitive subject
position”. This goes together with another aspect of preferred argument
structure, that is the constraint that in a transitive clause “in discourse there
regularly appears just one full lexical noun phrase.” (Du Bois, 2003, p. 60).
Now in Majang the A, if not overtly shown as a full NP, usually also does
not appear as a free pronoun (see section IV.3.1.1). As it is only present
through subject indexation on the verb, it does not materialize as a discrete
constituent of the clause at all. Therefore, in narrative texts, transitive
clauses most frequently have a constituent order of VP:
42
     See example III.10 for a discussion of the case of the A constituent.
128                              Chapter III.2Example III.20: constituent order VP

       He found an ash-pile.

      nɛ     èːŋáɗ-ír    ɗùŋéɗL          à      jòwɛːɗ-i=ŋ
      CONJ smell-CF.3S hyena\SG.ABS       CONJ   far-3S=SFT
      He smelled a hyena far away.
This structure, starting the clause with a verb followed by an absolutive NP,
is also encountered in intransitive clauses with an overt S, which makes this
the default construction of Majang, a syntactic configuration that is a reflec-
tion of the language’s ergative-absolutive nature:
        Verb – NPABS
The following examples show the absolutive NP filling the S and the P
position after the verb:
Example III.21: V-NP(ABS) default structure
   a) kùcù ɟègúj.
      kùc-í       ɟègúj
      come-3S.CJ ox\SG.ABS
      An ox comes.

      CONJ   REMPST     make\3S.CJ thing\PL.ABS.MOD fighting-POSS
      He made weapons.
In both examples, the 3S subject is indexed on the verb, which comes in the
conjoint form. In sentence a), the following noun phrase is the S of the in-
transitive verb, in the absolutive case. In sentence b), the NP following the
verb is the transitive object P, again in the absolutive case.","[132, 133, 134]"

III.2.2.2 Fronting of constituents and its implications for case marking
In natural narrative texts, subjects are overtly shown when a participant
needs to be re-established, for example after a change of subject, place or
time. In these cases the A or S usually does not follow the verb, but precedes
                        Case Marking on Central Constituents                         129it in natural discourse (see section V.3.1.2 for more information on fronted
constituents).
Example III.22: preposed re-activated subjects
     a) nɛ ɓáL ɟàrtíL cínɛ boŋú táːꜜrá gɛːnk, ...
        nɛ ɓáL        ɟàrtíL               cí-n-ɛ boŋ-í táːr-á
        CONJ REMPST woman\SG.NOM.MOD DEM-SG-HR take-3S.DJ meat-PL.ABS.MOD

     c) nɛ ɓòkóːrjánt kàwɛŋ.

        CONJ tortoise\SG.NOM bite-3S.DJ=SFT
        The tortoise bit it.
In these clauses, the A is invariably marked by the nominative case and is
just as invariably preposed. Having an alternative AVP structure is not unex-
pected according to Greenberg’s prediction that “all languages with domi-
nant VSO order have SVO as an alternative or as the only alternative basic
order” (Greenberg, 1966, p. 110). But Unseth was not able to confirm this
prediction based on elicitation (1989b, p. 109):
          “Deliberate attempts to elicit other word orders by topicaliza-
          tion did not produce any variants. Some SVO clauses were oc-
          casionally elicited at other times, such as in subordinate
          clauses […]. My Majang helper consistently rejected the SOV
          [sic!]43 examples in Bender’s article [...].”
This experience is a strong indication that the VAP order of constituents has
a firm psychological standing in the mental grammar of Majang speakers.
Although the AVP order has a high functional load in the syntax of the
language for re-establishing accessible participants, it is not something the
speakers have a conscious awareness of. Therefore mother-tongue translators
will have to be trained in the pragmatic significance of this structure, so that
43
     This is a typo in Unseth (1989). Bender (1983, p. 128f) presents rather unnatural AVP
     examples.
130                              Chapter III.2they can apply it appropriately without being unduly guided by the structure
of the source language.
Fronting the A-constituent to re-activate an accessible participant has striking
similarities with what has been observed as word-order alternations in other
related Eastern-Sudanic languages. For example, A-constituents in South-
east-Surmic Suri-Tirmaga (Bryant, 1999, p. 45ff), Western-Nilotic Päri
(Andersen, 1988, p. 293f) and Southwest-Surmic Baale (Moges & Dimmen-
daal, 1998, p. 297) are case-marked when appearing in post-verbal position,
but unmarked when in pre-verbal position. These languages have in common
that they place the unmarked or absolutive S preceding the verb. It would
therefore be tempting to describe Majang in similar terms, where the pre-
verbal position is the place to show all constituents in unmarked or neutral
case, and contrast these forms with the constituents found in the post-verbal
position, where the A-constituents are case-marked, either with the nomina-
tive or ergative case, depending on the other findings in the language. It is
probably such a perspective that prompted the previous analysis of Majang
as a marked-nominative language (König, 2008, p. 191).
But the data presented so far makes it clear that the situation is quite dif fer-
ent from that found in marked-nominative languages such as Suri-Tirmaga
or Baale. The case marking of pre-verbal constituents can in no way be cha-
racterized as neutral or unmarked, as it is different from the absolutive case
of postverbal P- or S-constituents. The following observations can be made
about the pre-verbal position:
      •   Ergative-marked constituents cannot be fronted.
      •   The absolutive case cannot be found in pre-verbal position, except
          when accompanying a co-referential contrastive pronoun (see exam-
          ple IV.219). Absolutive case forms further appear in left-dislocated
          position (see section V.7.1.2), but these are syntactically different
          from fronting, as left-dislocated material is placed outside the clause.
      •   Accordingly, only nominative-marked constituents are found in pre-
          verbal position.
      •   No fronting was observed in any natural clause that does not also
          have some other pre-verbal material – at least a conjunction, fre-
          quently a tense marker and sometimes adverbial material. Elicited
          clauses with a nominative S and without an initial conjunction al-
          ways have the S following the verb.
                    Case Marking on Central Constituents                  131    •   Elicited transitive clauses with postverbal nominative A were reject-
        ed by the consultants. The only corpus occurrence is a narrative-text
        subordinate clause, seen in example V.125.
The nominative case is therefore by no means restricted to the preverbal po-
sition – nominative-marked S-constituents and subjects of speech clauses are
frequently placed after the verb. It is therefore not possible to consider the
nominative form a pre-verbal allomorph of the absolutive form, as nomi-
native and absolutive S contrast in the postverbal position (as in example
III.13).
In summary, it is not possible to transfer the findings in other Eastern-
Sudanic marked-nominative languages as a possible explanation for the situ-
ation in Majang. The pre-verbal appearances of S or A are not unmarked for
case, and they are not positional variants of the post-verbal absolutive case.","[134, 135, 136, 137]"
"Example b) shows the subject noun tɔ̀nL ‘child’ to be in new-information fo-
cus, as it is in the last position of the clause, following the object, and as a
topical constituent, because it is marked by the nominative case and fol-
lowed by a modifier with the SFT-marker. The language consultants agree
that both clauses V.91b) and V.92b) cannot invert the order of subject and
object to the canonical order. This is very instructive for the interpretation of
central cases in Majang. If one were to pursue the analysis that the difference
between ergative and nominative was not grounded in topicality, but in fo-
cality, then all ergative occurrences would have to be explained as focused
constituents of a clause. The situation here now suggests that any constituent
in new-information focus appears at the end of a clause. But this is not the
place where ergative constituents are usually found. This implies that there is
an inherent difference between focus and ergative, which is confirmed by the
fact that when focus and topical constituent go together, as in example
V.92b), the nominative case is chosen.
The same can be tested for the P of a transitive clause. The response to a
question for the P can follow both a disjoint and a conjoint verb, and it can
382                              Chapter V.7come with and without a sentence-final topicality marker. Again, all re-
sponses need to be interpreted as having a P in information focus.
Example V.93: question and response with topical and non-topical P in focus
   a) ɗàm kɔ̀ dɔ̀mɔ̀ːn ɟíkon?
      ɗàm      kɔ̀      dɔ̀mɔ̀ːn     ɟíkon

      He ate the aforementioned meat.","[387, 388]"
"V.2 The Structure of the Verb PhraseThe verb phrase105 in Majang may consist of the verb itself and a number of
accompanying words, which T. Payne (1997, p. 84) proposes to call auxili-
aries, which is not the terminology chosen in this grammar. In Majang these
words are the tense markers introduced in section IV.3.4.2, and the short
pronouns introduced in section IV.3.1.1. They can also co-occur in the same
verb phrase, in the order tense marker – short pronoun:
105
  This understanding of the verb phrase is different from definitions of the VP in generative
  grammar models, where the VP may include all information that is not contained in the
  subject NP, including the object NP. The verb phrase in Majang only contains the non-
  nominal material presented in the following discussion.

"I.11 Typological OverviewThis section contains an overview of the basic typological facts about Ma-
jang for easy reference. The details of all these features should be read in
their respective passages in this language description.
Compared with other Surmic languages, Majang has a very small consonant
inventory with only 18 consonants, including two implosives /ɓ, ɗ/ (see sec-
48                             Chapter I.11tion II.2.1). The language provides no systematic opposition between stops,
fricatives and affricates – all these sounds can be subsumed under the single
label obstruents.
Majang has seven vowels (including two sets of mid vowels, see section
II.1.1), without ATR vowel harmony (section II.1.4). There is contrast be-
tween short and long vowels (section II.1.3). Important phonological rules of
Majang are labial harmony, which rounds the short vowel /i/ to /ù/ in verbal
suffixes following syllables containing round vowels or labial consonants,
and the morphologically restricted vowel-height harmony, which changes
the vowel /ɛ/ into /e/ following a high-vowel syllable (section II.5).
The tonal inventory consists of two tones plus downstep (section II.6). It can
be shown that some morphemes in Majang are inherently toneless, and that
another morpheme requires an analysis involving a polar tone. Many words
demonstrably end in a floating low tone (section II.6.3), which is often at-
tached to apparently toneless morphemes. Tone plays an extensive role, not
only in distinguishing lexical items, but also in the grammar of Majang.
The Majang morphology is predominantly agglutinative, with segmental af-
fixes containing individual bits of grammatical information (only suffixes
are productive, with two unproductive prefixes). Some grammatical features,
however, such as noun number and case, are indicated by stem changes or by
tonal means. Like most Eastern-Sudanic languages, Majang does not display
grammatical gender, but it provides a very diverse number- and case-mark-
ing system on nouns, with a large number of inflection classes (section
IV.1.3). Case marking is complicated by the provision of special forms for
modified nouns in some syntactic cases (section IV.1.3.2). Unlike other Sur-
mic languages, Majang has no distinction between inclusive and exclusive
forms of the first person plural of pronouns or verbs.
The language has a variety of personal pronouns for various functions. One
set of pronouns serves for general anaphoric reference, another for reference
inside the verb phrase, and a third for contrastive purposes (section
IV.3.1.1). Demonstratives and relative pronouns code a three-level deictic
system, with reference to either the speaker, the hearer, or a place away from
them both (sections IV.3.1.2, IV.3.1.3). Possessive pronouns indicate the
person of the possessor together with number reference to the possessed
entity (section IV.3.1.4). Interrogative pronouns always appear at the end of
the question.
                              Typological Overview                             49Many Majang verbs come in pairs of perfective and imperfective, where the
imperfective form is derived from the perfective form through partial redu-
plication (section IV.2.2.7). Furthermore, all verbs are inflected with subject
suffixes. Most verbs also distinguish between a tonal conjoint (CJ) form and a
disjoint (DJ) form; the conjoint form is only applied to verb phrases that are
immediately followed by a non-topical NP in the absolutive case (section
III.3). Another grammatical category frequently expressed on the verb is di-
rectionality, which comes in three values: centripetal (CP) forms, which
indicate a movement towards the deictic center; centrifugal (CF) forms, which
express a movement away from the deictic center; and deictic TransFer (TF)
forms, which are used for a movement from one deictic center to another
deictic center.
The basic order of constituents in Majang transitive clauses is VAP, where A
stands for the transitive agent and P for the transitive patient-like constituent,
usually the object. The order of constituents is fairly fixed in the language,
except for the option to front certain constituents (mostly subjects) for syn-
tactic and pragmatic reasons (section V.7.1).
Pragmatic factors indeed have a major influence on the syntax of Majang.
The case marking of central participants of a clause depends on their topical-
ity (section III.1). If they are not topical, S and P are marked by the same
absolutive case (examples a and b):
Example I.3: non-topical case marking of central constituents
   a) kàwɛ èːɟɛː wárL kɛkàr.
      kàw-ɛ      èːɟɛː        wárL     kɛkàr
      bite-3S.DJ cat\SG.ERG dog\SG.ABS again
      A cat bites a dog again.
   b) ɗegàr wàrL kɛkàr.
      ɗegàr       wàrL     kɛkàr
      sleep\3S.CJ dog\SG.ABS again
      A dog sleeps again.
   c) kàwɛ wàr íɗítL.
      kàw-ɛ      wàr         íɗítL
      bite-3S.DJ dog\SG.ERG   man\SG.ABS
      A dog bites a man.
50                                Chapter I.11The non-topical A, however, is marked by a different case, the ergative (ex-
ample I.3c). If topical, this A is marked by yet another case form, the nomi-
native, which is also used for a topical S:
Example I.4: topical case marking of central constituents
     a) ɗegàrL wàr kɛkàr.
        ɗegàrL      wàr      kɛkàr
        sleep\3S.DJ dog\SG.NOM again
        The dog sleeps again.
     b) kàwɛ wàr íɗítL.
        kàw-ɛ      wàr       íɗítL
        bite-3S.DJ dog\SG.NOM man\SG.ABS
        The dog bites a man.
The three different case forms of ‘dog’ – wàrL (ABS), wàr (ERG) and wàr (NOM)
– are only distinguished by tone, but different they are. Two more clause-
level cases are used by the Majang language, the dative (DAT) and the loca-
tive (LOC), plus a further possessive (POSS) case to mark nouns as possessors of
a noun phrase. A detailed discussion of the cases and their use is presented in
sections IV.1.3.2 and III.2.1.2.
Though the constituent order VAP is normal, the verb is often found at the
end of the sentence. In that situation, another morpheme is attached to the
verb, the sentence-final topicality marker =ŋ (SFT). This marker indicates
that the final constituent is either the verb phrase or a topical noun phrase
(see section III.4 for its discussion).
The language makes use of some valence-changing devices. Most notable
among those is the antipassive (AP) (section V.5.1). A genuine passive con-
struction in the sense of Dixon (2010a, p. 166) is not encountered in the lan-
guage – its function is partly covered by the impersonal form, an inflectional
device described in section IV.2.3.1.
In spite of Unseth’s (1989b, p. 106) claim to the contrary, Majang does not
have postpositions, and only a few questionable prepositions (section IV.3.6).
Relative clauses are very frequent in Majang, and can be both restrictive and
descriptive (section V.8.5). Some temporal adverbial clauses have subordi-
nate-tense verb forms (section V.8.3.1). Otherwise tense is only expressed
through tense markers which appear to be working along the lines of a
metrical tense system (section V.6.1.1).
                                                                           51
Part II: Phonological Inventory and
OrthographyThis section introduces the inventories of the Majang phonology – vowels,
consonants and suprasegmentals. It also displays the rules which govern the
use of the various elements of these inventories.
In this section, data presented without any kind of bracketing is understood
to be in its surface-phonemic representation, transcribed according to the
phoneme inventories shown in tables 1 and 3. Only when further phonetic
detail needs to be shown for greater clarity, phonetic data is supplemented in
square brackets […]. On the other hand, in some places information is given
about the individual morphemes making up a word. These are always shown
in their underlying representation, and the brackets {…} are used to sur-
round such lexical units. This is different from the other parts of this lan-
guage description, where the underlying representation is shown without
brackets.
Individual sounds are shown by /x/ to be phonemic, by [x] to be phonetic and
by <x> to be in orthographic representation.","[53, 54, 55, 56, 57]"

Acknowledgements
I want to thank the following people for their contribution to this study:
The main language consultant for this study was Joseph Kalakun. In many of
the research sessions Joseph was supported by his colleagues of the Majang
Bible Translation Project, Hawariyat Babure, Epheson Teramaj, and, until
2011, Abyot Girma. This was graciously permitted by the Illubabor Bethel
Synod of the EECMY. James Kim and Gallo Aylate helped setting up the re-
search sessions. Furthermore, James and his wife Whashu shared their
knowledge and material on the Majang language.
Other Majang speakers contributing to this work were Yordanos Addisu,
Kadiree Nyamor, Nibeyat Dimesse, and Ashine Astin.
Tyler Schnoebelen generously shared his personally collected Majang Data
with me. Sandra Hufnagel transcribed most words of the Comparative Afri-
can Word List, initially supported by Stefanie Hauser.
Pete Unseth shared more data and analysis with me. He once intended to
write this very language description, and I am glad that he entrusted me with
completing this work.
I am grateful to Drs. Moges Yigezu and Getachew Anteneh for the ideas and
inspiration we shared with each other while working on the same language.
I benefited from practical help by various friends and colleagues. David Ford
spent hours editing sound files, and even more on proofreading. Seyoum
Berhe translated materials from Amharic to English. Tefera Endalew pro-
vided logistical help in Mizan Teferi. Other workers of the Bench-Maji MLE
project, particularly Efrem Belay, helped me immensely in later stages.
My doctoral supervisor Maarten Mous and co-promoter Constance Kutsch-
Lojenga gave good feedback on all parts of this study, and more came from
the committee members Gerrit Dimmendaal, Doris Payne, Jenneke van der
Wal and Maarten Kossmann. Further conversations I had with Mary Pearce,
Keith Snider, Helga Schröder, Colleen Ahland, Michael Ahland, Mike
Bryant, Joshua Smolders, Anne-Christie Hellenthal, Don Killian, Manuel
Otero, Mike Cahill, Roger Blench, and Tom Payne. More occasional advice
was given by numerous participants on the SIL Linguistics Discussion List.
Colin Davis created the language map on page 37. Anne-Christie Hellenthal
provided the Dutch Samenvatting at the end of this book.

III.2.2.3 Further typological observations relating to word order
Beyond the order of verb, S, A and P, the nuclear clause can also have in-
direct objects and further complements. These regularly follow the more
central constituents.
Example III.23: locative NP following the object
   nɛ rìːɓé kàːrí kɔ̀nk ɗóːkL.
   nɛ rìːɓ-ɛ         kàːrí             kɔ̀nk      ɗóːkL
   CONJ put-3S.DJ coffee.leaf\SG.ABS   REF\RECPST ground\SG.LOC
   She put the coffee leaves on the ground.
Example III.24: dative NP following the object
   ɛ ríːɓérgéːL kòcíé nɛːk ádá.
   ɛ      ríːɓér-ge2ːɗ       kòcíé      nɛːk           ádá
   CONJ put.inside-TF.3S.CJ pipe\sG.ABS POSS\3S.SG.ABS mouth\SG.DAT
   He put her pipe into the mouth.",[137]
"Examples a) and b) are orders to a second person, and example c) is an im-
personal construction. The recipient is coded as dative in all cases. Example
b) actually has two dative constituents; beyond the recipient the speaker in-
troduces himself as the beneficiary into the proposition, which is marked as a
dative short pronoun inside the verb phrase.
The benefactive can of course also be used with intransitive verbs. The fol-
lowing example rather shows a malefactive use of the dative case with the
intransitive verb ŋàːr ‘go’:
Exàmple V.54: benefàctive ùse with intransitive verbs
   ŋàːr kɔ̀ éːtáL còlàk bàːbúj nɛːkík.
   ŋàːr         kɔ̀    éːt-àL còlàk   bàːbúj          nɛːk=k
   go\3S.DJ RECPST 1S-DAT towards husband\SG.ABS POSS\3S.SG.ABS=SUB
   She left me towards her husband. (lit: She went – against me – to her husband.)All in all, the nature of the dative case marking as a non-central case of
Majang gives the impression that the third argument of Majang ditransitive
verbs carries less syntactic prominence than can be observed in countless
other African languages. Whereas many Bantu languages treat it on par with
the object or even as the only object of ditransitive constructions, as de-
scribed in Joswig (1996) for Swahili, and whereas several Afro-Asiatic lan-
guages of Ethiopia show similar structures, in the Majang language the reci-
pient is always coded by the dative case. In order to give it a more central
status, one needs to use the TF-form in the recipient-removal construction
                 Grammatical Relations in the Simple Clause                 357(section V.5.4). In this sense, the language needs to be seen as a direct-
object language in the terminology of Dryer (1986, p. 815), or a patient-
oriented language according to my own terminology (Joswig, 1996, p. 62).","[362, 363]"

     I am deeply indebted to Gerrit Dimmendaal, who pointed me to this phenomenon usually
     found in some Bantu languages. He (Dimmendaal, to appear) reports a similar conjoint-dis-
     joint distinction for the Southwest-Surmic Baale language, and sees traces of it in South-
     east-Surmic Mursi.
134                                  Chapter III.3The terminology of conjoint and disjoint is taken from Bantu linguistics45,
where similar distinctions46 are found in a number of Eastern Bantu lan-
guages. Creissels (2012, p. 1) describes this distinction as follows:
       “[…] a conjoint verb form is a verb form that cannot be found
       in sentence final position, and cannot be separated from the fol-
       lowing phrase by a pause. A disjoint verb form is a form that
       does not have this limitation, but is not excluded from non-final
       contexts either, and a disjoint verb form in non-final position is
       not necessarily separated from the following word by a percep-
       tible pause.”
This description defines conjoint and disjoint in entirely structural terms,
and, as it stands, describes the behavior of the conjoint and disjoint forms in
Majang quite accurately, which is why this terminology is adopted here for a
Nilo-Saharan language. As far as I know, the terms conjoint and disjoint
were not applied previously for languages displaying ergative-absolutive
structures – this makes it necessary to use caution while applying the terms
in the Majang context with its very different syntactic and pragmatic en-
vironment compared to Bantu languages.
When it comes to the function of conjoint and disjoint forms, there are at
least some Bantu languages where the definition of conjoint and disjoint re-
mains on the structural level (Van der Wal, 2011, p. 1735). But even for
those, van der Wal asserts that “there are pragmatic effects attached to the
choice for the one or the other verb form, where the element following the
conjoint form is non-topical and may be focal [...]” (ibid.).
Van der Wal’s (2017, p. 15) most recent definition of the conjoint-disjoint
distinction is even more explicit in the inclusion of information structure as a
defining criterion:
       “The conjoint/disjoint alternation is an alternation between
       verb forms that are formally distinguishable, that are associ-45
   Besides the Surmic languages indicated by Dimmendaal, conjoint-disjoint distinctions out-
   side the Bantu family were also reported for Adamawan Doyayo (Elders, 2006) and the Gur
   language Yom (Fiedler, 2017).
46
   The situation in Majang does not fit the defining characteristics of metatony, as sum-
   marized by Hyman (2017, p. 108). Metatony in Bantu happens whenever the verb in ques-
   tion is followed by an object. But this is not the case in Majang, where the presence of an
   object in itself is not sufficient to trigger the tonal difference.
                             Conjoint-Disjoint Distinction                                 135       ated with an information-structural difference in the interpreta-
       tion of verb and/or following element and of which one form is
       not allowed in sentence-final position.”
Riedel (2009, p. 31) observes that in those languages which have this dis-
tinction, “a disjoint verb cannot precede certain focal items, such as wh-
words.” Even if this holds true for Bantu languages, such a claim cannot be
made for Majang. The conjoint form is not consistently observed in all
places where the verb is followed by a constituent in focus. The following
example shows the disjoint form preceding an interrogative pronoun:
Example III.29: disjoint forms preceding focussed NP
       ɟàrtí náːk, ɗàm kɔ̀ ɟìkónt?
       ɟàrtí          náːk         ɗàm       kɔ̀       ɟìkónt
       woman\SG.ABS POSS\1S.SG.ABS eat\3S.DJ RECPST.DJ what.ERG
       My woman, what ate her?
Furthermore, example V.93c) shows a disjoint form preceding a constituent
which apparently is in a new-information focus position, as the response to a
content question47. If the conjoint form cannot be reliably encountered in
front of constituents with new-information focus, then focus is apparently
not what the conjoint form signals.48
My previous publication on the conjoint-disjoint distinction (Joswig, 2015)
asserted that the distinction was based purely on syntactic parameters (p.
175). But this was written before I fully understood the importance of topi-
cality in Majang. Assuming topicality as the starting point of the conjoint-
disjoint distinction in Majang, as envisioned by Van der Wal (2011, p.
1735), would render the language much more similar to the state of affairs in
Tswana, as described by Creissels (2012, p. 18), which also has a super-47
   For a discussion of wh-questions as diagnostics for new-information focus, and some
   caveats, see Van der Wal (2016, p. 264ff).
48
   Van der Wal (p.c.) points toward a possibility how conjoint and focus may still be indirect -
   ly related in Majang; the assumption would be that verb phrases are marked as conjoint
   when the adjoining NP is counted as being inside the VP constituent – this would only ever
   happen to absolutive NPs, but only when they refer to unexpected or new, that is, focal en-
   tities. Question words in Majang are apparently outside their linear order in the clause (see
   section III.2.2.4), and therefore also outside the VP constituency, which would explain the
   disjoint marking preceding focal material. The same would have to be assumed for disjoint
   marking preceding NPs denoting responses to questions, such as in example V.93c).
136                              Chapter III.3ficially syntactic conjoint-disjoint distinction; it is diachronically traceable to
the presence or absence of a topical NP.
Topicality, as defined in section III.1, serves other purposes in Majang
beyond deciding the conjoint-disjoint marking, as it also is the basis of DEM
and differential-S marking. It turns out that disjoint marking before absolu-
tive P constituents always coincides with the placement of the SFT-clitic (see
section III.4), if all other structural conditions for its placement are met.
Therefore, the following is a summary of what the conjoint-disjoint distinc-
tion accomplishes in Majang:
      •   Only absolutive NPs can trigger conjoint marking on a preceding
          verb. Therefore, the conjoint-disjoint distinction is neutralized for all
          verbs not followed by an absolutive NP.
      •   The conjoint form on the verb shows that the following absolutive
          NP is not topical.
      •   If an absolutive NP follows a disjoint verb form, it implies that the
          NP refers to the P constituent of a transitive clause, and that this
          referent is topical.
      •   For S-constituents, the conjoint-disjoint distinction serves as a re-
          dundancy device indicating the topicality status alongside the dif-
          ferential-S marking described in section III.2.1.2. This is helpful in
          situations where the case forms are identical through syncretism (see
          example III.30).
Whether in a previous stage of the language the conjoint form was used pre-
ceding all non-topical constituents cannot be decided due to lack of pub-
lished data from any other related language. Currently one can only go by
today’s situation in Majang, which firmly places the conjoint form in front of
non-topical absolutive NPs, and the disjoint form in all other contexts.
So far the conjoint-disjoint distinction was only observed in languages which
do not make use of case marking. The syntactic status of an NP in Bantu lan-
guages can be captured by the more general terms subject, object, and ad-
junct, which are the terms used in the descriptions of Bantu conjoint-disjoint
distinctions (Creissels, 2012, p. 18 f; Van der Wal, 2011, p. 1738). In
Majang, instead, the syntactic properties of a noun phrase are closely related
to its case marking, and therefore the language must make reference to a
                         Conjoint-Disjoint Distinction                         137particular case (the absolutive) in order to assign the correct marking to each
verb.
It was stated above that conjoint status is a feature of the verb phrase, not
just of the verb. This is because in situations where the verb is followed by a
tense marker, such as kɔ̀, kɔ̀ː and ɓà, it is not the verb that is marked for con-
joint, but the tense marker. The verb appears therefore in the (apparently un-
marked) disjoint form, although the whole VP is conjoint (section IV.3.4.2).
The conjoint-disjoint distinction is quite useful for the syntactic interpreta-
tion of language data. The nature of the Majang case system does not allow
for an easy identification of case forms for each noun, as the differences be-
tween nominative, absolutive and ergative are usually expressed only tonally
or through idiosyncratic stem changes, if indeed they are expressed at all.
The conjoint-disjoint distinction therefore frequently allows a clear identifi-
cation between some homophonous case forms, as in the following
examples:
Example III.30: case disambiguation through conjoint and disjoint verb forms
   a) ɗeːgàr     wàrL        kɛkàr.
      sleep\3S.CJ dog\SG.ABS   again
      A dog sleeps again.
   b) ɗeːgàr     wàr         godej.
      sleep\3S.DJ dog\SG.NOM house\LOC
      The dog sleeps at the house.
Both examples have the same verb ‘he sleeps’ as the intransitive predicate.
Example a) has it immediately followed by the S in the absolutive case.
Example b) has the same S-NP following the same verb. Although on the
surface the two subject NPs in both clauses sound identical (the lack of
downstep on the nominative form cannot be heard in this context with a fol-
lowing low tone), the difference of the conjoint-disjoint marking on the verb
makes it clear that in example a) wàrL is in the absolutive case, whereas in
example b) wàr is not. It is therefore marked by the nominative case, which
becomes only clear through the redundancy effect of conjoint marking.
138                              Chapter III.4III.4 The Sentence-Final Topicality Marker (SFT)Another device of the Majang language related to topicality is the sentence-
final topicality marker (SFT).
This device consists of a velar nasal =ŋ, added as an enclitic to the last con-
stituent of a main clause, if this constituent is either a verb phrase or a topi-
cal NP. This main clause needs to be the last element of its sentence; a main
clause that is not the final clause of its complex sentence is not marked.
The following set of examples shows the use of the SFT-marker at the end of
the verb phrase:
Example III.31: SFT-marker following verb phrases
  a) kɛː ɓàrtɛŋ.
     kɛː         ɓàrt-ɛ=ŋ
     then        give.birth-3S.DJ=SFT
     Then she gave birth.
  b) pàːkkíː kɔ̀ːŋ.
     pàːk-kí ,ːL    kɔ̀ːL=ŋ
     hot-CP.1P.DJ NFUT=SFT
     We will soon be hot.
  c) nɛ ŋàːr nɛːkɛ ɗéːgàrŋ.
     nɛ     ŋàːr         nɛːkɛ   ɗéːgàr=ŋ
     CONJ   go\3S.DJ then        sleep\3S.DJ=SFT
     He went and then slept.","[139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"
"This is a somewhat fascinating construction. The short pronoun tà is seman-
tically the same as the 1S.DAT pronoun tàL seen in example V.12. This results
in a dative NP preceding the absolutive object, which again would violate
the order of constituents in Majang. The canonical order of constituents is
only preserved by the assumption that tà is part of the verb phrase. This is
confirmed by the change of tone to L on the particle, which is best explained
as the conjoint marking of the VP, because the VP as a whole is followed by
a non-topical absolutive NP. In this, tà mirrors the tonal behavior of tense
markers, which also take on the conjoint marking in the appropriate environ-
                       The Structure of the Verb Phrase                   337ment. Assuming that these short pronouns are part of the verb phrase there-
fore avoids having to assume a special constituent order just for their sake.
Short pronouns can also precede the verb, as in the following sentence:
Example V.17: short pronoun preceding the verb
  nɛ kɔ̀ːL nà díːleːr èpcón.
  nɛ kɔ̀ːL nà           díːl-ɛːr  èpcón
  CONJ NFUT 2S.DAT carry-CF.3S Epheson
  Epheson will bring it out to you.","[342, 343]"
"This example does not display any imperative morphology, which is also
confirmed by the fact that the absolutive object at the end of the clause is
marked by the SFT-marker. My consultants agreed that it is neither more nor
less polite to place an order in this way. It is just a different option. The use
of the dative short pronoun in this example is different from the dative of
interest seen in other examples of orders; here it is used to refer to the indi-
rect object of this ditransitive clause.

Jussive forms are like imperatives, but directed at participants other than 2nd
person. All jussive forms have a particular hortative particle directly in front
of the verb, which is used in its regular indicative form. In the following I
only call third person forms jussive, and use the more specific terms horta-
tive for 1st person plural jussive forms, and precative for 1st person singular
and plural jussive forms.
3rd person jussives
A Majang jussive form in the third person expresses a wish or an expectation
that some participant not directly involved in the speech act should perform
an action.

V.7.1 Constituent order variation
The basic constituent order of Majang was introduced in section III.2.2.1 as
verb – A/S – P – complements and adjuncts, with a preverbal slot that con-
tains any temporal information of the simple clause. But it was also seen that
A and S constituents can be preposed to the preverbal position to re-activate
the participants (see section III.2.2.2).
More fronting happens with noun phrases marked as contrastive topics, even
beyond the subject.
Example V.81: fronting of NPs with contrastive topic

"V.1 The Structure of the Noun PhraseThe head noun appears at the beginning of a noun phrase. The order of con-
stituents is as follows:
   head noun – demonstrative/possessive – relational noun – quantifier –
                             relative clause
Example V.1: examples for noun phrase ordering
  a) òláL cìgì bàŋɛ
     òláL             cì-g-ì  bàŋɛ
     things\NOM.MOD DEM-PL-SP all
     all these things
  b) ɓɛːɲɔ̀ɛL gɛːnk bàŋɛ
     ɓɛːɲɔ̀-ɛL       gɛːnk         bàŋɛ
     day-PL.ABS.MOD POSS\3S.PL.ABS all
     all his days
330                                Chapter V.1It was shown in section IV.3.3 that quantifiers are less closely connected to
the noun phrase than demonstratives or possessives. While these trigger the
modified form of certain cases on the noun, any quantifier (if not joined by a
demonstrative or possessive, as in example V.1) leaves the head noun in a
non-modified state.
Example V.2: quantifier and noun
   òlátL      bàŋɛ
   things\NOM all
   all thingsIn this example, as opposed to example V.1a), the quantifier is the only other
constituent relating to this noun, and the noun appears in its plain form òlátL
instead of in the modified form òláL. It therefore appears as if the quantifier
is not really part of the noun phrase. The same is true for all relative clauses
– they leave the head noun in the plain, not in the modified state.
Example V.3: noun followed by relative clause
   ɟóːpL cìgì rɛbɛcꜜkáːnáꜜkík
   ɟóːpL         cì-g-ì   rɛbɛcL-káːn-àkL=k
   people\ABS REL-PL-SP trouble-NOMIN-PL.ABS=SUB
   persons that are troublemakersIn this example the plain absolutive plural form ɟóːpL is used as the head-
word, not the modified form ɟóːL. It is interesting to note that in spite of their
formal similarity, the demonstrative and relative pronouns have a different
effect regarding the modification status of the noun that precedes them; de-
monstratives trigger a modified case form, whereas relative pronouns do not.
Relational nouns typically convey spatial information and derive from
nouns. See section IV.3.6 for a discussion about their status as part of the
noun phrase. Relational nouns always appear as the last element of a noun
phrase, but preceding any quantifiers.

IV.2.1.2 Finite verbs
The finite verb in Majang follows this template (Figure 9):
         Stem – Extension – Direction – Relative Tense – Referential Object –
                             Person (+ conjoint/disjoint)
                             Figure 9: affix template of finite verbsNone of the suffix slots are filled for all verbs. There are some zero allo-
morphs among the person morphemes, and the extension slot and the relative
tense slot are rarely used. Each verb could also be followed by various
clitics, such as the sentence-final topicality marker =ŋ or the subordinate-
clause marker =k. Any simple or derived stem may serve in the stem slot;
some means of derivation are introduced in section IV.2.2 below. The ex-
tension slot may contain the semantically empty suffix -k in front of some
person markers, but only in certain verb classes. It is inserted for phono-
logical reasons, and it never appears in the same verb with a relative tense
marker or a direction marker; therefore the relative order between these is
not relevant, except that the analysis proposed here sees the extension as an
extension of the stem. The direction slot follows the stem directly only for
81
     For the i-class, the 3S, 2P and the 3P forms are also defined by the class-vowel, but they are
     subject to the labial-harmony rule 4, which changes short /i/ to /ù/ for the verb lòw.
                                     Verbs                                    211two of the set of three direction markers, centripetal and centrifugal. The
deictic-transfer direction marker is regularly placed following any relative-
tense marker. The relative-tense slot is used for a few morphemes connect-
ing the verb to its pragmatic temporal setting, and only in subordinate
clauses. Although the referential-object suffix is identical to one of the
relative-tense forms, it does not fill the same slot, as it follows other relative-
tense suffixes.
Some person markings are characterized by tonal changes on the stem. The
person-marking suffixes themselves are portmanteau morphemes that also
carry the conjoint-disjoint distinction of the language. Conjoint forms indi-
cate that the immediately following NP in the absolutive case is non-topical.
In all other situations, the disjoint form is used (see section III.3 for informa-
tion on the use of this distinction).
Aspect is expressed through the choice of different verb stems, with the im-
perfective aspect using a reduplicated version of the perfective root.
Other grammatical categories often associated with verbs in other languages
are not expressed through inflectional categories on the verb in Majang: ab-
solute tense and modality use other means, such as free particles or auxiliary
verb constructions.","[216, 217]"
"Example b) shows the A noun phrase, marked by the ergative case, as the
last element of the clause, even following the object. This pragmatically
marked structure is the only environment in which the order of subject and
object can be reversed in the language. This is also the case for an A marked
by the nominative case:

III.2.2 Constituent order typology and its impact on case marking
This section presents the basic facts on the order of constituents in Majang
(III.2.2.1), and how this affects the analysis of Majang as a language with
126                             Chapter III.2differential ergative marking, as some neighboring languages show differing
case-marking behaviors in pre-verbal and post-verbal positions. Section
III.2.2.2 shows that the state of affairs in Majang is quite different. Sections
III.2.2.3 and III.2.2.4 provide other observations about Majang constituent
order that do not affect the understanding of case marking, but that readers
may want to look for in this section because of important claims made by
previous grammars on Majang.","[131, 132]"
"Therefore the following order of constituents can be established for the
nuclear clause:
        verb – (S/A) – object (P) – complement
Temporal information is usually not placed into the nuclear complement slot,
but into a pre-nuclear slot. Any kind of pre-nuclear temporal information,
however, requires the presence of a preceding conjunction. This may be the
132                              Chapter III.2reason why almost any clause in a narrative text, even a main clause, begins
with some kind of conjunction, usually the connector nɛ.

deviate from the basic clause configuration. The verb is directly followed by
an absolutive noun phrase, and therefore none of the pragmatic markings
provided by the language are in evidence. The verb appears in the conjoint
form, indicating that the P is non-topical, and no sentence-final topicality
marker is placed. The constituent order is in compliance with the canonical
VAP of Majang.
Other pragmatically relevant features are also set to the default: the sentence
is affirmative, and therefore has no negative morphology. It is a declarative
sentence, therefore there is no question morphology or sentence tone in-
volved, and also no imperative or jussive morphology is in evidence.
This section now presents the effects of any changes to this default prag-
matic setting: markings for individual constituents as topical or focus, nega-
tion, questions, and imperatives with jussives.","[380, 381]"
"IV.3.6 Adpositions
One of the Majang language’s claims to fame up to this point was its alleged
use of postpositions in spite of its VAP nature. Unseth (1989b, p. 106) states
that words like ràŋ ‘top’, tàk ‘inside’ and wàlɛc ‘from outside’ are postposi-
tions, linking these to similar findings in Murle (Arensen, 1982, p. 117) and
Didinga (Odden, 1983, p. 169). Therefore, these Surmic languages apparent-
ly contradict Greenberg’s (1966, p. 78) language universal 3, stating that
“languages with dominant VSO order are always prepositional.”
Contrary to Unseth’s findings, these words show several characteristics that
preclude their interpretation as postpositions. T. Payne (1997, p. 87) states
that adpositions derive historically from nouns or verbs, and that a good way
to find out if a word is one or the other is its behavior. When it is a verb or a
noun, it takes on verbal or nominal inflection markers; when it is a preposi-
tion, it doesn’t. Applied to Majang, one needs to see whether the stated
words still can take on nominal morphology (as they apparently go back to
nouns) or not. Now, the two words ràŋ ‘top’ and tàk ‘inside’ can indeed be
inflected for case. They show up in this form when the noun they relate to is
locative:

"
III.2.2.4 Question particles and question words
Unseth (1986a, p. 97) pointed out that the Majang language violates Green-
berg’s (1966, p. 111) 12th universal, which states that “if a language has do-
minant word order VSO in declarative sentences, it always puts interroga-
tive words or phrases first in interrogative word questions […].”
This universal is indeed violated in Majang, as the interrogative pronouns
and question words are always found at the end. See section V.7.3.2 for the
use of these interrogative pronouns.
Example III.26: question words at the end of the clause
   àríːL kój cáːL òlà cìgì ɛk?

   How will we then do these things?",[138]
"This conjoint-disjoint distinction on tense markers allows the conclusion that
this distinction doesn’t operate narrowly on the verb as such, but on the
whole verb phrase. Frequently these tense markers actually appear in the
preposed temporal slot preceding the verb and other preposed constituents
such as nominative subjects. This is true whenever a clause is introduced by
a conjunction such as nɛ, nɔ̀ or ɛ:

III.2.1.2 Differential ergative marking
Many languages with morphological ergative-absolutive case marking do
not have ergative-absolutive alignment in all possible contexts. If a language
displays an ergative-absolutive pattern in one context, and a nominative-
accusative pattern in another, the language is said to have split alignment
(Comrie, 1989, p. 110), for which Dixon (1994, Chapter 4) attempted to
31
     The example I had presented to this effect (Joswig, 2016, p. 473f) is troublesome in this and
     other ways, particularly because the A of the whole sentence was misanalysed as ergative,
     when it was, in fact, in the nominative case.
                     Case Marking on Central Constituents                  113establish universal criteria. These will need to be discussed for their applica-
bility in Majang, as in this language, too, split phenomena can be observed
beyond the already mentioned verb-indexation versus post-verbal case-mark-
ing split. But it will become clear that these split phenomena are quite differ-
ent from split phenomena in other ergative languages, and that it is better to
describe the data in terms of differential ergative marking (DEM), as pro-
posed by McGregor (2010, p. 1614f).
Practically all examples involving the ergative case are from elicited lan-
guage data. Looking at Majang narrative texts, it is very difficult to find
clear examples of the ergative case. The only two unambiguous examples
that I was able to find in my corpus of well-analyzed texts are the following:
Example III.9: ergative case found in narrative discourse
   a) nɛ càːdíL ɓéɲ òmáltè dɛnɛ wàːloːk gòpàn wɛjL lɛːrík.

      woman\SG.ABS POSS\1S.SG.ABS eat\3S.DJ RECPST what\ERG
      My woman, what ate her?
In these examples, the A of the transitive clause is marked by the ergative
case, as evidenced by the HL sequence on the last syllable of the proper
name in example a), and by the special ergative form of the interrogative
pronoun (see p. 387 for the other case forms of this pronoun) in example b).
In example a), the ergative is chosen for a main participant following a reset
of time and place, and with a different subject than in the previous clause. In
example b) the ergative is used for a question word asking for an unknown
subject; the object of this clause is left-dislocated (see section V.7.1.2) to a
position outside the clause. A less clear example shows an NP in the am-
biguous form that is identical for both the modified nominative and the
modified ergative:
114                                      Chapter III.2Example III.10: textual example with ergative case assumed by word order

   because that hyena had killed his friend,The NP ɗúŋéL cìnɛ can be either nominative or ergative according to its mor-
phological shape. The reason to assume that it is ergative in this clause is its
position following the verb, where in clear textual examples nominative A-
NPs were never encountered (see section III.2.2.1).
These rare examples taken from natural discourse are balanced by countless
examples from elicitation, using questionnaires with context-free example
sentences, where practically every transitive clause yields an ergative-abso-
lutive pattern, illustrated in the following clauses:
Example III.11: ergative case found in elicited sentences
   a) ɗɛnɛ wàr àdùreàk L.
      ɗɛn-ɛ     wàr                 àdùre-àkL

      kill-3P.DJ hog-PL.ERG            man\SG.ABS
      Hogs kill a man.
Undoubtedly these examples are unnatural in the sense that it is very dif-
ficult to find them in narrative discourse. The factor of preferred argument
structure, as proposed by Du Bois (1987, 2003), in combination with the ten-
dency of Majang to avoid free pronouns for subjects, explains the very low
frequency of ergative-marked noun phrases in natural texts. Preferred argu-
ment structure discourages the use of a full NP as an A argument. An NP that
                         Case Marking on Central Constituents                             115is not there cannot be marked for ergative, which renders the ergative case
invisible in a language that only ever marks it on an NP.
Still, it would be unwise to discount the information gleaned from such ex-
amples on the basis that they do not come from narrative texts. It remains a
fact that when a Majang speaker is asked to produce a transitive sentence,
without fail s/he first comes up with an ergative-absolutive case pattern in a
VAP clause. This alignment system therefore represents a deeply ingrained
grammatical structure that probably sees prominent use in everyday natural
discourse, but not in the kind of structured texts that linguists tend to analyze
for writing their grammars. The observer is faced with the notion that “when
a departure from Preferred Argument Structure does occur in natural dis-
course, the resulting utterance bears not a hint of ungrammaticality” (Du
Bois, 2003, p. 78). After all, “Preferred Argument Structure cannot be re-
duced to a grammatical rule. It must remain within the domain of discourse,
as a patterning of grammar with consequences for grammar” (ibid).
Now it still needs to be asked where exactly in natural discourse the erga-
tive-absolutive alignment system thrives to the point that it appears as the
grammatical system of choice in almost all elicited transitive clauses; if no
one ever uses it in any speech situation at all, this alignment system would
be quickly forgotten by the grammar. Looking outside the narrative genre, in
my case, did not provide the answer: one text of my corpus is a planning
conversation between three speakers with well over 150 clauses, and still the
ergative case does not feature in this at all. The same is true for a short horta-
tory text. It therefore remains a rewarding task for future research 32 to deter-
mine the segments or genres of Majang natural discourse that freely admit
the use of ergative-absolutive systems. My hypothesis is that they must exist,
and that I just have not found them.
As for the alternative to this ergative-absolutive alignment system: as stated
above, the main reason why it is almost impossible to see ergative-marked
NPs is preferred argument structure. But even an existing A-NP is usually32
     Watters (2018, p. 394ff) conducted such research for the Tibeto-Burman language Dzong-
     kha, comparing the impact of genre on competing case-marking patters. For that language,
     Watters concluded that “grammatical relations in Dzongkha is found to range from a split-
     ergative system to a pragmatic system, whereby the manifestation of one marking pattern
     over another is probabalistically dependent on and functionally motivated by genre.” The
     exact findings, however, are very different from the situation in Majang, showing a higher
     probability for ergative-marked As in monologic texts.
116                                     Chapter III.2not marked by the ergative case. Majang noun phrases can be marked ac-
cording to two competing case marking systems: one of them is the non-
topical ergative-absolutive case marking system, and the other the topical
nominative case marking for A or S. The choice between the two is of a
purely discourse-pragmatic nature, based on the topicality of the A or S in
the discourse (see section III.1 for how the concept of topicality is estab-
lished for Majang). The elicited examples seen above show non-topical in-
stances of A (elicited examples usually deal with non-topical participants, as
they leave the relevant context open to the interpretation of speaker and
hearer), and these are marked by the ergative case. In narrative discourse,
new participants are usually introduced in intransitive clauses, or as PS or ob-
liques, but practically never as an A (Du Bois, 1987, p. 828). From then on,
as long as they are activated participants, they are topical and therefore usu-
ally marked by the nominative case33:

"V.7.3 Questions and focus
This section presents a short overview of questions and focus phenomena, as
far as they have been studied so far.
Majang contrastive focus is accomplished by the use of the contrastive pro-
nouns (see section IV.3.1.1). Contrastive focus often entails a choice from
already known entities, which is why Dik (1989, p. 278) cautions against
equating focus with information new to the hearer. This is therefore a prag-
matically different situation from new-information focus, as defined by
Thwing and Watters (1987, p. 101): “Focus: that information in an utterance
which the speaker believes, assumes or knows that the hearer does not share”.
Information questions are a widely accepted and applied test for new-infor -
mation focus (Van der Wal, 2016, p. 264ff), as the component in question is
assumed to be in focus. The expected answer provides confirmation or infor-
mation, and as such is always new information (Dixon, 2012, p. 377). Study-
ing questions can therefore be revealing about focus structure, because, as
Dik (1989, p. 280) points out, “if a language has special strategies for the
expression of focus constituents, these strategies will typically be also used
for question words.”
The Majang language, in spite of its VAP syntax, places information with
new-information focus at the end of the clause, and does so also with interro-
gative pronouns, which fill the slot of new information. The responses to
questions fill exactly the same slot as the question words that solicited them:
Example V.91: information packaging in questions and their responses
      a) ɗàmíːL kɔ̀ tàːr woːɗ?
         ɗàm-íːL          kɔ̀   tàːr     woːɗ
         eat-AP.3S.DJ RECPST\CJ meat\SG.ABS who\SG.ERG
         Who ate meat?108108
  Here is an unexplained use of the detransitivized verb form in a question. This seems to be
  in free variation with the plain verb form in example V.92. Possibly the use of the detransi-
  tivized form has to do with the use of an unspecified and therefore non-individuated object ,
  which may then result in a less than fully transitive form of the verb.

IV.3.5 Auxiliaries
There are not many auxiliaries in the Majang language. Auxiliaries are
lexically empty verbs whose purpose is to provide the grammatical
information needed for another verb that comes in a reduced grammatical
shape, but that provides the semantic content to the proposition (T. Payne,
1997, p. 84).
The morpheme that fits this definition best is the negative auxiliary k- that is
needed to precede the negative verb forms introduced in section IV.2.2.1.
Whereas the negative verb form is unchanged for all persons, the subject
information is provided by the negative auxiliary.
The negative auxiliary, just like verbs, has different endings for the 1 st, 2nd
and 3rd person in the singular and plural:
314                                  Chapter IV.3Example IV.268: conjugation of the negative auxiliary
   1S kà pàːkkà        I am not hot
   2S kín pàːkkà       you are not hot
                              SG
   3S kí pàːkkà        it is not hot
   1P kíː pàːkkà       we are not hot
   2P kí *ːr pàːkkà    you are not hot
                              PL
   3P kír pàːkkà       they are not hot
Unseth (1989a, p. 119) recorded the negative marker as kù-, which is pro-
bably a dialectal variation that I did not encounter during my data collection.
Getachew (2014, p. 177ff) seems to have recorded the negative marker with-
out the vowel /ù/.
The negative auxiliary can undergo further inflection than just the bare per-
son suffixes seen above. It can appear with the impersonal marker:
Example IV.269: impersonal negative auxiliary
   máL tɛːnàn ɟéːmɛL kɛːL rɔ̀ːríjáːtìŋ.
   máL tɛːnàn     ɟéːmɛL         k-ɛːL  rɔ̀ːríjáːtìŋ
   but instead previously NEG-IMPS teach\NEG
   But they were not previously taught.
Furthermore, the negative auxiliary is also the carrier of any directional in-
flection marking:
Example IV.270: negative auxiliary with centripetal inflection
   kìːkíːL túːkɛːL ɟóːpL ɔ̀gɔ̀ wàlɛc.
   k-ìːk-í ,ːL túːk-ɛːL ɟóːpL        ɔ̀gɔ̀ wàlɛc
   NEG-CP-1P join-NEG people\ABS.MOD other from.outside
   We don’t join with other outside people.
The following are the negative auxiliaries with direction markings:

ary:

city to do something. It is inflected as an ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verb.
Example IV.273: auxiliary oːl ‘can’
   óːlùn típír à éːkeːr.
   óːl-ìn      tí-pír       à    éːk-eːr
   can-2S.CJ INF-fly\ABS.SG CONJ truth-PL.ABS
   You can truly fly!
As seen here, this auxiliary is followed by an infinitive verb form.
Furthermore there are a few verbs which can serve as full verbs in some con-
texts, but which can also serve as auxiliaries to other verbs, in order to pro-
vide modal or aktionsart information.
The first of these is the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verb ɗɛj with the meaning ‘want’ and ‘need’.
This is used to indicate deontic or optative mode to a proposition. If so, then
the other verb appears in the infinitive form:
Example IV.274: ɗɛj as an auxiliary
   a) ɔ̀kɔ̀n làkɛL ɟóːpL gɔ̀ ɗɛjɛr àmbàbɛːt, ...
      ɔ̀kɔ̀n làk-ɛL          ɟóːpL       gɔ̀      ɗɛj-ɛr     àmbàb-ɛːt

316                               Chapter IV.3The same lexeme is also used as a full transitive verb, with the desired object
in the P slot:
Example IV.275: ɗɛj ‘want’ as a transitive verb
   ɗɛjɛrL màcáːpɛL nɛːk cìnǐŋ joː?

"The three examples display the forms of ‘mother’ for a first person (a), se-
cond person (b) and third person possessor (c). There is no unpossessed form
of mother in Majang. Example c) further illustrates a second characteristic of
kinship terms: if they are the head of a possessive NP, their possessor nouns
do not use the regular forms of the possessive (-konk or -k), but they use the
dative form. This trait of kinship terms was already carefully described by
Unseth (1992b, p. 99). Other examples of suppletive kinship forms are the
following:
Example IV.98: some other kinship nouns
            1st person       2nd person   3rd person
  father    bàːbɛːL          ɓàːɓá        ɛpɛn
  sibling   dèːdéː           mácóːkòjL    máɲáLIV.2 VerbsVerbs in Majang are defined by their various syntactic and morphological
properties, which are different for finite and infinite verb forms. All verbs
can be used in a finite form with person marking, and all verbs can also be
used in the negative and infinitive forms, which are not marked for person.
These criteria, however, also apply to words denoting stative property con-
cepts, which morphologically are very similar to verbs. They are therefore
                                               Verbs                                              209treated as a sub-class of verbs in section IV.2.4, where they are called stative
verbs in line with the nomenclature applied to other Surmic languages.
Readers looking for the category of adjectives in Majang are therefore di-
rected to that section.
Finite verbs are characterized by their ability to serve as the predicate of a
clause, without the use of either a copula or a subject pronoun. More about
the use of verbs can be gleaned from sections V.3.2.2 and V.3.3.","[214, 215]"
"The alternation regarding the position of the verb apparently goes back to a
restriction that each clause needs to begin with either a conjunction or a
verb.
The only other material that can be analyzed as being part of the verb phrase
is the particle ɗeL, which is part of a few phrasal verbs: dòkú ɗéL ‘he sits
down’ or dùnkú ɗéL ‘he lies down’. This particle is always found immediate-
ly following the verb and is therefore apparently an integral part of the verb
phrase. It cannot be left-dislocated like tense markers or short pronouns.
338                             Chapter V.3V.3 Grammatical Relations in the Simple ClauseGrammatical relations are the way in which a language establishes formal re-
lationships between a predicate and the most important participants in a sim-
ple clause, based on the perspective the language has on the semantic and
pragmatic situation (T. Payne, 1997, p. 129ff). Each language’s grammar is
deeply impacted by the perspective the language takes. This is certainly the
case for the Majang language, which places a high emphasis on the pragma-
tic outlook of a proposition. It forces different case-marking strategies for
the most central participants.
This grammar does not intend to follow the terminology, even less the for-
malisms of any particular theory or model of grammar. It hopes to be still
useful and readable when all the models or theories of grammar fashionable
at the time of its production have long been cast aside by future generations
of linguists. But this does not mean that it ignores all contemporary thinking;
the early 21st century provides a wide variety of useful models to inform the
work of a descriptive linguist. Particularly the area of grammatical relations
requires that a grammarian discloses what perspective was adopted when
looking at the data.
The choice of terms such as predicate and participant in the preceding sec-
tions reveals that my perspective has been chiefly a functional one. I believe
that the concept of valence and the idea of the predicate frame, both well de-
veloped by Simon Dik (1989) in his Functional Grammar, provide simple
and insightful tools to describe what is going on in a clause, and my termino-
logy borrows heavily from Dik’s model. Slightly more modern influences on
my analysis of the Majang data come from Croft (2001), Dixon (2010a) and
VanValin & LaPolla (1997). The following terms are used in this section:
      •   Predicate: the central element of a clause, semantically defined by
          what is being said about the subject. The predicate slot of a clause
          may be filled by verbs, stative verbs, nouns, pronouns, quantifiers,
          even adverbs. Each different word category may require a different
          construction.
      •   Participant: a being or object involved in the semantic representa-
          tion of a clause. This participant may or may not be referred to by a
          noun phrase.
                Grammatical Relations in the Simple Clause                  339    •   A: the most agent-like participant in a transitive clause.
    •   P: the patient or undergoer of a transitive clause. The participant
        most affected by the action.
    •   S: the only central participant of an intransitive clause.
    •   Construction: a syntactic configuration resulting from the combina-
        tion of a particular predicate with particular participants in a particu-
        lar pragmatic setting.
The simple clauses in Majang are characterized by a surprising variety of
constructions, triggered by various factors to which the Majang syntax pays
particular attention. Some of these factors are of a syntactic nature. Other
factors make reference to the semantic and pragmatic makeup of the propo-
sition.
In this section various simple-clause constructions of Majang are presented.
They are introduced by stating the various parameters that influence these
constructions, followed by a listing of these constructions, showing how dif-
fering combinations of the listed parameters result in different clause con-
figurations.","[343, 344, 345]"

38                               Chapter I.3It appears that the Majang originated from places further south, probably
near the Boma plateau in South Sudan (Stauder, 1970, p. 108). Since the Ma-
jang do not own cattle and live in otherwise unpopulated forests, they have
moved gradually northwards, establishing settlements in the previously am-
ple forest areas of western Ethiopia. In the course of this, they probably did
not displace other populations, except possibly the Shabo, who are the only
other forest dwellers in the area. During Stauder’s time, all but the northern
(near Dembidolo) Majang settlements were inhabited for a longer time than
collective memory could establish (Stauder, 1970, p. 110).
The southern origin of the Majang people is supported by considerations of
syntactic typology. Dimmendaal (1998a, p. 66) assumes a verb-second basic
word order for Proto-Surmic, which changed to a strict VAP pattern for the
Didinga-Murle languages through language contact with neighboring Nilotic
languages. The Majang language also follows a VAP pattern, but without
having any VAP languages in its immediate neighborhood. Dimmendaal
(1998a, p. 77) therefore states that “the verb-initial structure of Majang re-
mains somewhat enigmatic historically, given its current geographical posi-
tion [...] i.e. given the absence of strict verb-initial languages in the immedi-
ate vicinity of this language.” An origin from near the Boma plateau would
place the Majang ancestors in the immediate vicinity of some Nilotic VAP
languages, and this would explain Dimmendaal’s enigma.","[43, 44]"
"V.9 Continuity (Cohesion) and DiscontinuityIn this section a number of devices are briefly introduced that allow Majang
speakers to keep track of topics and ideas in discourse. A full treatment of
these factors requires a much more extensive discourse analysis based on a
larger text corpus, but a few initial thoughts can already be presented here.
Continuity refers to the cohesion a text may display because of recurring
themes, actions, and topics (T. Payne, 1997, p. 344). Languages use specific
devices to make this cohesion visible, and also to show where continuity is
broken by the introduction or dropping of current themes, actions or topics.
                      Continuity (Cohesion) and Discontinuity                             409V.9.1 Topical (referential) continuity
The Majang language shows topical continuity by referring to ongoing topi-
cal constituents in a minimal way. The default clause structure of Majang is
VP or VS, depending on transitivity, as codified in the least marked order of
constituents Verb – NPABS (see section III.2.2.1). This assumes that the sub-
ject is identical with a current activated participant. In this case, the subject
is not expressed overtly in the clause, but just through indexing by the sub-
ject marker on the verb.

"Quite often, as in examples a) and b), the speaker can place the 1S.DAT short
pronoun as a dative of interest into the clause to indicate that s/he is the be-
neficiary of the action. Just as often as the imperative form speakers use the
regular 2S indicative verb form to give something that very much sounds like
a command:

"II.7 Word StructureBeyond what was stated so far on syllable and stem/root structures of
Majang, only a few observations need to be added for phonological words.
Majang phonological words are in principle not restricted in length or num-
ber of syllables, although, of course, there are practical limitations, based on
the needs of the speakers to form meaningful words with the word-formation
processes available to them. Words consisting of five syllables, such as
ɗegegeríkíː ‘we know each other’ are fairly frequent. On the other hand, very
short words are common in Majang, such as the vowel-only conjunction à.
As already pointed out, the Majang language provides some clues about pho-
nological word boundaries. The most important of these is the word-internal
downstep rule which lowers the second of two adjacent underlying high
tones within a word (see section II.6.2). The demarcating function of this
rule was illustrated by example II.30. Another tonal word-boundary marker
is a contour tone, which can only appear on the final syllable of a phono-
logical word.
                                Sentence Tone                               99II.8 Sentence ToneApart from the two tone levels and downstep, Majang also displays some
tonal phenomena which operate on higher levels than the phonological word.
I call these phenomena sentence tone in order to distinguish them from less
predictable emotive pitch phenomena which are often called intonation in
the literature and are unhelpfully lumped together with what is called sen-
tence tone here. This study does not address intonation in this narrower sense
of the word, but restricts the description to phenomena that can be linked to
the syntactic structure of the utterance.","[104, 105]"
"II.9 Transcription and OrthographyThe orthography of Majang has not been officially settled, although litera-
ture production is already under way. For the purposes of this study, the fol-
lowing conventions are used to unambiguously transcribe all phonological
distinctive features:
The consonants and vowels are represented as shown in the phoneme charts
(Tables 1 and 3). Long vowels are represented by the vowel plus the phonet-
ic length symbol, e.g. <àː>, <ɔ̀ː>; two identical consonants meeting at mor-
pheme boundaries are represented by the doubling of the consonant charac-
ter, e.g. <kk> – they are pronounced as geminated consonants. As seen in
section II.1.3, the representation needs to distinguish between long vowels
and sequences of two identical vowels, which are in this study indicated by
doubling the vowel symbol, instead of using the IPA length marker.
Tones are represented according to the following conventions: a high tone is
marked by an acute accent (e.g. <á>), and a low tone by a grave accent (e.g.
<à>). The tone is marked where it is associated after the application of all
lexical rules. Therefore it is not necessary to indicate automatic downstep.
Automatic downstep happens when a low and a high tone are in sequence.
Non-automatic morpheme-downstep is indicated by the symbol <ꜜ>, and
floating low tones by <L>. Rising tones (LH) are marked by the symbol <à*>,
and falling tones (HL) by the symbol <à>.
Some morphemes of Majang are inherently toneless and copy the tone of the
preceding syllable. In the surface representation used for most examples,
these morphemes are shown with the resulting surface tones. But when refer-
ence is made to the morphemes as such, they are shown without any tone
marks. Similarly, one morpheme, the 1P.DJ suffix -í ,ːL takes the opposite tone
of the preceding syllable (see section II.6.3). In the surface representation
used in this study, this suffix is shown with the resulting surface tone. But
when reference is made to the suffix as such, it is shown as above with a
superscript cross, to indicate that this suffix has a polar tone underlyingly.
102                                  Chapter II.9A falling tone can be a tone falling from the same level as the H on the pre-
ceding syllable, or from a downstepped H. This is, for example, an important
distinction between some conjoint and disjoint 3S.TF verb forms, as in ŋàːrgeːɗ
[   ] < {ŋàːr-geːɗ} ‘go-TF.3S.DJ’ and ŋàːrꜜgeːɗ [   ] < {ŋàːr-ge2ːɗ} ‘go-TF.3S.CJ’.
This is caused by the different behaviors of the two morphemes; the first
copies the H of the preceding syllable and builds the contour from that, and
the second builds the contour from its own newly introduced H. To show the
difference between the two forms of the TF.3S forms, the one starting with a
copied H has the marker < >, and the one with its own H has the marker < >.               2
This difference is shown orthographically only for the underlying represent-
ation, which does not show morpheme downstep.
A final complication is presented by suffixes such as the infinitive marker
/-ɛːL/, which places a single high tone on the complete word. To distinguish
morphemes of this kind from those which copy an existing high tone, and
from those which just have their own underlying high tone without affecting
the word stem, any reference to such a suffix makes use of the super-high-
tone marker < >, so that the underlying representation of the above infinitive
marker is /-ɛːL/. The same notation is used for morphemes with a tone-re-
placement behavior that is blocked by low tones on the stem, such as the re-
lative-past markers {-íːɗ} and {-ɛɗ} seen in examples IV.165 d-i).
Majang publications that already exist use a practical orthography that is
quite close to the one used here, with the following differences:
      •   Tone has so far not been marked in the orthography, but the Gam-
          bella Region authorities are considering ways in which the most im-
          portant grammatical distinctions can be written.
      •   <s> is used for /c/, and <j> for /ɟ/, and <y> is used for /j/.
      •   The implosives are often written as digraphs <bh> and <dh>.
      •   Long vowels and double consonants are written by doubling the re-
          spective character.
      •   Publications vary in their treatment of the vowels /ɛ/ and /ɔ̀/, and the
          nasals /ŋ/ and /ɲ/. Some do not distinguish the open-mid vowels
          from /e/ and /o/, and they treat the nasals as digraphs <ng, ny> (see
          the texts in Getachew (2014) for this orthography). Other publica-
          tions use special characters <ɛ, ɔ̀, ŋ, ɲ> for these sounds, which re-
          quire advanced technical solutions to be available to the typists.

Part III: Basic SyntaxThe grammatical part of this language description is divided into three major
sections. Part IV: Morphology introduces the various forms encountered in
the Majang language, whereas Part V: Other Syntactic and Pragmatic
Topics provides a detailed account of how the Majang language creates
larger grammatical structures, mostly from a functional perspective. But
before introducing the forms and structures, this preliminary part III is
needed, which sets the context by presenting the various systems that con-
tribute to the understanding of the information structure in the clause. The
following concepts need to be discussed in some detail, so that they can be
used in the succeeding parts IV and V: topicality, differential ergative mark-
ing, differential-S marking, pre-verbal and post-verbal case marking (and
other aspects of basic constituent order typology), the conjoint- and disjoint
distinction, and the sentence-final topicality marker ( SFT). Each of these is
introduced in the following sections and subsections.
This means that these concepts have to be introduced without detailed infor-
mation on forms and paradigms; sufficient information is given to show that
indeed there is a justification for the establishment of these concepts, but all
formal and structural details are introduced in the following parts IV and V.
This hopefully reduces any repetition to a necessary minimum.","[107, 108, 109]"
"I.10 The CorpusThis section gives an overview of how this study came about, and how its
presentation is envisioned.
                                  The Corpus                                  43I.10.1 The nature of the research
The research conducted for this study was impacted by two main factors: the
requirements of the Leiden University Ph.D. program under which this dis-
sertation was developed, and the expectations I had to meet as a result of my
affiliation with SIL International, working in Ethiopia. Fortunately, both
were not set against each other, and there was a lot of helpful overlap. Still,
having to work in a full-time position resulted in the inevitable neglect this
study received over time, which means that it took much longer than this
kind of research is supposed to take. It also had the disadvantage that I was
not able to spend extended periods of time in the language area, and I did not
develop any active proficiency in the language.
In the Introduction, it was stated that this study is based on both elicited data
and natural texts, against Dixon’s advice (2010a, p. 321ff), who insists that a
grammar should always be based on natural data only, possibly augmented
by data from elicited paradigms to fill gaps. I believe that such a restriction
would have led to a poorer description of this language. I will explain in
section III.2.1.2 why there are good reasons not to expect a high number of
ergative forms in narrative or conversational discourse, which is exactly
what happened in the texts studied for this grammar. Not only was I forced
to elicit ergative structures by using contrived examples, I also had to go
through countless paradigms of both verbs and nouns in order to get a clear
identification of the forms found in the texts. Part IV: Morphology makes it
clear that it is not possible to just look at a verb or, particularly, a noun in
Majang to determine its syntactic status. For practically each noun encoun-
tered in a text, I had to collect a full number-case paradigm to be sure of
what particular form I was looking at, especially when it came to central-
case forms, and often even beyond that. Any hope that I would accumulate
sufficient knowledge of forms exclusively from natural texts would have
been totally unrealistic.
My corpus of well-analyzed texts contains 2879 words, availing me with
sufficient material to demonstrate the various structures of the language in
the sections that follow. It is balanced by many pages of elicited sentences
and paradigms. Occasionally I also draw on less well-analyzed texts for ex-
amples to illustrate a particular point.
The research began in 2008 with a phonetic transcription of the 1700-word
Comparative African Word List (CAWL, Snider & Roberts, 2004), which
was initially prepared for me in 2007 by two linguistics students, Sandra
44                                     Chapter I.10Hufnagel and Stefanie Hauser. This word list, arranged by semantic do-
mains, constituted the main source of information in the very early stages of
this research. Using this resource, I collected the singular-plural paradigm
for each noun, and the main-clause paradigms for all persons for each verb
encountered. It also served as the basis for the tone analysis conducted in
2008 at a tone workshop in Addis Ababa.
This tone workshop introduced me to the methodologies propagated by both
Constance Kutsch Lojenga and Keith Snider 4 and gave me an excellent set of
tools to formulate and test hypotheses. This was amplified by the qualities of
my language consultant during that workshop, Joseph Kalakun, who is a
good whistler and who compares the tone patterns of different utterances
with a high and well-deserved confidence.
A substantial amount of textual material was given to me by both James Kim
and Pete Unseth, who collected these texts years before. I picked some of
these texts, re-recorded them and applied my own transcription. This was ne-
cessary, as no tonal information was present in the old transcriptions, and
there was much uncertainty about vowel qualities and quantities. Two of
these texts are presented in section VI.1. Most texts were traditional narra-
tives, but I also analyzed a hortatory text written in the course of a discourse
workshop in the early 2000s, and I recorded a new spontaneous conversation
between the three main consultants, which provided me with structures not
encountered elsewhere in my corpus. Many of these appear as examples in
the following sections.
As I slowly discovered the various case forms of Majang, I devised diag-
nostic frames that I could apply to all nouns, and in this way I was able to
glean the various nominal paradigms presented in sections IV.1 and IV.2.2.1.
For verbs, I was easily able to collect paradigms about basic finite forms,
nominalizations, infinitives, negative forms, and direction forms. It was
more difficult to create appropriate frames for the subordinate-tense forms.
More and better research can and should be conducted on this, including the
other tense options, aspect and mode.
All texts, all lexical information and much of the grammar was entered into a
database running under the SIL Fieldworks software. For the phonological
analysis I used SIL Phonology Assistant, supported by both Praat and SIL
Speech Analyzer. Much of the paradigm analysis was facilitated by the help-
ful spreadsheet features of OpenOffice and LibreOffice.

IV.2.3.6 Combined forms
It is possible in Majang to combine subordinate forms with direction and re-
ferential-object forms. This may result in very complex morpheme combina-
tions. When this happens, the differing inflectional categories are added to
the stem in the following order:
96
     I have not encountered a verb with both the referential-object marker and the relative-past
     marker, and I cannot say whether such a verb is possible in Majang.
274                                 Chapter IV.2   stem – CP or CF marker – subordinate tense marker – REFOBJ marker – TF
                                  marker
The person marking is always attached to the last marker of the verb, except
for inflection-class markers, which follow the stem directly. As usual, the
class markers form one morpheme together with the suffix that follows
them.
Example IV.193: combined form with SIMUL and REFOBJ
   ègè cìnì cìnɔ̀ pàːrírkúnɗɔ̀L dákɛɗàk.
   ègè cì-n-ì            cì-n-ɔ̀     pàːr-írkùn-ɗ-ɔ̀L       dákɛɗà=k
   COP   DEM-SG-SP       REL-SG-DIST try-SIMUL-REFOBJ-2P.DJ   only=SUB
   Only this is what you are going to try.
In this example the verb pàːrírkúnɗɔ̀L ‘while you will try it’ consists of the
                                                         PLstem pàːr, the simultaneous-subordinate marker -kùn preceded by the inflec-
tion-class marker -ír, and finally the referential-object marker -ɗ together
with the 2P marker -ɔ̀L.
Another example of a combined form is the following conjoint paradigm of
a centripetal relative-past form, based on the verb ɗɛnɛr ‘notice’, which is in
itself a derived inceptive form of the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verb dɛn ‘see’:
Example IV.194: centripetal relative-past paradigm
      ɗɛnɛr                                     notice
   1S ɗɛnɛrkíɗà          ɗɛn-ɛr-kí-ɗà       after I noticed
   2S ɗɛnɛrkíɗín         ɗɛn-ɛr-kí-ɗín      after you noticed
                                                         SG
   3S ɗɛnɛrkíɗ            ɗɛn-ɛr-kí-ɗ         after he noticed
   1P ɗɛnɛrkíɗíː         ɗɛn-ɛr-kí-ɗí ,ːL   after we noticed
   2P ɗɛnɛːtàrkíɗɔ̀      ɗɛn-ɛː-tàrki-ɗɔ̀    after you noticed
                                                         PL
   3P ɗɛnɛːtàrkíɗ        ɗɛn-ɛː-tàrki-ɗ      after they noticed
In this example, as well as in example IV.142 above, which shows a simulta-
neous-progressive paradigm on a derived stem, there is a formative -t separ-
ating the derivation marker from the subsequent inflection-class marker. In
this case the preceding /r/ is replaced by compensatory lengthening.","[279, 280]"
"Examples a) and b) both have a nominative intransitive subject, followed by
bàŋɛ. That these are not absolutive NPs is demonstrated by the disjoint verb
form. Also, the absolutive plural form of ‘things’ is olà, and the absolutive
plural of ‘heart’ is dúndeɛ. The first thing to be noted is that the SFT-clitic is
not used at the end of these two sentences. If bàŋɛ were part of the NP head-
ed by òláːtL, then one would expect the clitic to be in evidence, as the sen-
tence would then end in a nominative NP. That the clitic is not used reveals
bàŋɛ to be a constituent outside the subject NP. Furthermore, in both clauses
the plain nominative form is used, instead of the modified nominative forms
    L              L
olà and dúndeɛ , which gives additional proof that bàŋɛ is not serving as
modifier to either NP. Example c) shows an ergative NP followed by ɓàŋɛ,
and again the plain ergative form olàːt is used instead of the modified erga-
tive olàL. It might appear more helpful to translate bàŋɛ as ‘entirely’, to give
a better rendition of its adverbial nature. Nonetheless, for the sake of simpli-
city, it is glossed as ‘all’ throughout this work.
It is puzzling, however, that bàŋɛ is not found where other adverbs are ex-
pected to be, that is at the end of the clause. Example c) clearly shows it be-
tween the subject NP, to which it provides quantitative information, and the
object NP.
Other quantifiers are even more openly adverbial in their nature by using the
clause-internal conjunction à in front of a person-marked stative-verb form:
Example IV.244: modifier ɓɔ̀ːkà ‘many’
   a) làkɛL ìɟáːgákL à ɓɔ̀ːkàːŋ.

302                                       Chapter IV.3IV.3.3.2 Numerals
The numerals of Majang follow a peculiar quintesimal system based on the
small limbs of hand and feet (Unseth, 1989b, p. 101). The first 20 cardinal
numbers follow a neat arrangement based on this body-part related way to
count:
Example IV.245: the first 20 cardinal numbers of Majang
          first hand      second hand           first foot             second foot
      1   òmóŋL        6 tùːl à òm    11        áːrn à òmóŋL      16   áːrn à tùːl à òm
      2   pɛːjL        7 tùːl à pɛːjL 12        áːrn à pɛːjL      17   áːrn à tùːl à pɛːjL
      3   ɟíːtL        8 tùːl à ɟíːtL 13        áːrn à ɟíːtL      18   áːrn à tùːl à ɟíːtL
      4   àŋàn         9 tùːl à àŋàn 14         áːrn à àŋàn       19   áːrn à tùːl à àŋàn

Two of the ingredients to these first 20 numerals can be traced back to body
parts: the number 10 apparently goes back to áríŋ, the plural of àrí ‘hand’;
the number 20 is a full grammatical sentence using the word for ‘person’.
Example IV.246: number 20

List of bound morphemes
The following is an alphabetic list of all bound morphemes of the Majang
language, as encountered in this work. V in a prefix stands for the first stem
vowel in a total vowel harmony context. In a suffix it refers to the class vow-
el of the verb (à, ɛ, or i). The following tonal conventions are used to refer to
the underlying tone of the morpheme:
          •   -i (no tone indicated): a toneless morpheme – the morpheme copies
              the previous tone.
          •   -í:, the morpheme takes the polar (opposite) tone of the previous
              tone.
          •   -í: the morpheme’s high tone replaces all other tones on the stem.
In brackets for each morpheme a reference points to the relevant lowest-level
numbered section where information on this morpheme is given.

Introduction
      “Grammar and discourse interact with and influence each
      other in profound ways at all levels, so that in real life neither
      can even be accessed, not to mention explained, without refer-
      ence to the other.”
This statement by John Du Bois (2003, p. 49) may serve as a fitting tag-line
for this language description, which provides much justification to his idea.
The past few years of my attempts to first understand and then describe the
structure of the Majang language were deeply impacted by this interaction
between grammar and discourse. The project began with a tone workshop
under the guidance of Keith Snider and Constance Kutsch Lojenga in Addis
Ababa in 2008; there I became convinced that another description of the
Majang language would add value to the efforts of previous and contempo-
rary linguists, simply because my newly gained understanding of the tone
system would give me a considerable advantage that was not available to
them. With this confidence about tonal differences, I felt that I could open
doors into the inner systems of the grammar by identifying all the categories
that so far were not described by my colleagues.
I started by analyzing a substantial word list, and then worked on simple
narrative texts. They revealed that Majang had very little to offer in the way
of case marking, as most central constituents appeared to be unmarked for
case. After some time I started branching out from the texts by eliciting fur-
ther data, and this was the first time that it dawned on me that things might
become more complicated. The consultant at that time returned completely
unexpected tone patterns to me, both on verbs and nouns, so that after a few
days of this I falsely concluded that I could not trust his data and decided not
to work with him again. What is worse, I went through the data I collected
from him and corrected it to the way I thought it had to be, because it just
did not fit my assumptions.
Next then came another workshop, this time about grammar, which was
based entirely on elicited material gleaned from a number of motivated lan-
guage consultants. After a short time with these men it became very clear
that the Majang language had a surprise in store for me that I did not expect
to find in an African language – a full-blown ergative-absolutive alignment
system, probably the most robust specimen encountered so far in any lan-
guage on the continent. I went through my text corpus again to change all the
30                                 Introductionglosses according to this new discovery, correcting all the data where I must
have misheard things initially. Unfortunately, I ran into more and more diffi-
culties with this, as rather a lot of the early transcriptions did not quite fit the
new revelation.
Some elicited data finally made me aware that there must be some split sys-
tem regarding intransitive subjects. Often they came out with different cases
than the absolutive I expected, and I presented this as some kind of split-S or
fluid-S system at the 2015 Nilo-Saharan colloquium in Nairobi. Later, I
checked my data again and discovered what seemed closer to the truth, a
split-ergativity system based on the pragmatic parameter of topicality, which
fits very well into the framework provided by typologists (section III.2.1.2).
Then going through the tedious job of checking all the paradigms of nouns
encountered in my texts, I made the startling discovery that, with very few
exceptions, ergativity did not appear in any of the texts. I was looking at a
language with two faces – one with a vibrant ergative-absolutive nature
jumping at me from all my elicited grammar data, and another one stubborn-
ly aligned along nominative-accusative characteristics in my texts.
There are explanations for these two natures, grounded in the aforemention-
ed interaction between discourse and grammar. In the discussions that follow
I hope that I do this language justice. One thing I have learned in the process
of preparing this grammar: whatever the linguist finds out depends to a great
extent on the nature of the available data. Had I followed the advice of only
looking at data from natural texts, I would probably not have encountered
the ergative-absolutive nature of this language. Had I only restricted myself
to elicited data, I would not have realized how marginal the structures are in
the language, at least in the kinds of text that are usually analyzed by lingu-
ists. I am grateful that somehow I stumbled across the most felicitous mix.
This Majang grammar was written for linguists. This means that it is not par-
ticularly useful or even readable for those who want to learn the language, or
for linguistically untrained members of the Majang language community.
Other resources need to be (and hopefully will be) written for them. At least
it is my hope that this language description can serve as a resource for those
who will be creating such works of a less technical and more practical na-
ture. Reading this grammar requires a minimum of linguistic training, which
encompasses familiarity with the terms provided by what is called Basic
Linguistic Theory. This concept is now readily accessible in the three vol-
umes of the same name by Dixon (2010a, 2010b, 2012). Following the con-
                                  Introduction                                31cept of Basic Linguistic Theory entails the commitment to disregard any
particular contemporary grammatical theory or model in its current special-
ized terminology or formal representation, or to at least reduce it to a mini-
mum. The idea is that even in generations to come, linguists and typologists
will be able to make use of this description without having to first go
through a course on the intricacies of linguistics in the early 21 st century. I
hope to accomplish this goal by providing sufficient definitions for all ter-
minology that is not part of Basic Linguistic Theory, and by refraining from
any kind of formal representation that is not self-explanatory. Contemporary
readers who hope to find explanations and representations according to the
latest models will therefore be predictably disappointed. All in all, the focus
is mostly on description, and much less so on explanation.
For the most part, I also refrain from historical statements, and I take no part
in any discussion regarding the placement of Majang or any other higher-
level language family unit in any kind of genetic classification. Where the
presented data supports or contradicts any existing classification, I say so,
but without drawing any further conclusions.
This language description comes in several parts. The division into parts is
inspired by the ideas of both T. Payne (2006) and Noonan (2006), who en-
visioned the development of user-friendly grammars as coming from two
perspectives: one a form-to-function approach, and the other a function-to-
form approach. Although this division could not be upheld entirely, these
two approaches are reflected in Part IV: Morphology and Part V: Other
Syntactic and Pragmatic Topics of this language description. But I found it
necessary to add a third part preceding these two perspectives which deals
with the basic facts behind information packaging in the clause (Part III:
Basic Syntax). This is the shortest of the parts in this work, but it introduces
many of the concepts in both form and function that accompany the reader in
all the following sections. It also discusses my choices regarding analysis
and terminology, and explains why some alternative approaches were not
pursued in the interpretation of certain language structures. In a sense Part III
can be seen as the central chapter of the whole description.
Further elements necessary for a helpful language description are found in
the other parts. Part I: The Cultural, Ecological and Sociolinguistic Context
not only provides demographic, ethnographic and sociolinguistic informa-
tion on the Majang language and the people who speak it; it also gives de-
tails on sources and history of this study, and the people involved in it. It fur-
32                              Introductionther contains a short typological summary (section I.11) of the language.
Part II: Phonological Inventory and Orthography presents the findings of
the phonological analysis, which is an integral part of this study, together
with much of the data that underpins these findings. It also explains the par-
ticulars of the practical orthography used in this language description.
After the main grammar parts III-V, Part VI: Texts and Lexicon provides
two word lists, one from Majang to English and one from English to Majang,
to give an impression of the Majang lexicon. This is preceded by two sample
narrative texts, which show the language in natural use.
It is my sincere hope that the index provided at the end enhances the useful-
ness of the grammar to those who do not have the time to read this work
from beginning to end, since this usually describes the largest group of
grammar users.
                                                                        33
Part I: The Cultural, Ecological and
Sociolinguistic ContextI.1 The Name of the LanguageThe Majang language, a Nilo-Saharan language spoken in southwest Ethio-
pia, has been given many names; see Dimmendaal (1998b, p. 26ff) for a list
of names of all Surmic languages. The following are the names listed there
for the Majang language: Ajo, Ato Majangeronk (self-name, means ‘mouth
of Majang people’), Mageno, Majangir, Majanjiro, Mezhenger, Masongo,
Mesengo, Ojang and Tama. As seen in section I.3.1, the variety of names has
led to some confusion regarding the 2007 Ethiopian census.
The only names applied to the Majang people nowadays are based on the
(closely related) variants Majang, Mesengo and Mezhenger. Since these are
different orthographic representations of the self-name, they do not cause
any offense to the Majang people. I am not aware of any derogatory names
currently applied to the Majang people.
In this study, I use the name Majang language, or, in short, Majang.
The ISO 639-3 code for Majang is mpe. WALS (Dryer & Haspelmath, 2013)
uses the code maj, and Glottolog1 the glottocode maja1242.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]"
"V.6 Tense, Aspect and ModeTense, aspect and mode (TAM) are grammatical features that provide infor-
mation about the non-spatial setting of a proposition (Dixon, 2012, p. 1ff).
Studying these extensively requires a very deep look into how the Majang
language community views events and their temporal structure. This section
does not attempt to get close to a comprehensive treatment of these parame-
ters in the Majang language. This would have required much more space,
and, more importantly, a bigger text corpus in order to identify the various
functions covered by the devices used in the Majang language. It is therefore
important to state beforehand that the area of tense, aspect and mode remains
an area for very rewarding future research.
366                              Chapter V.6One thing that can be said as a general remark about the workings of TAM is
that the Majang language does not treat the three components tense, aspect
and mode in the same way, or even in the same slots of any morphological
template. Quite different devices and strategies are chosen to address these,
and even in the single functional area of tense, the marking strategies range
from tense markers over verb suffixes to temporal markings used on refer-
ential particles.","[371, 372]"
"For the analysis of the Majang impersonal construction it is important to pay
attention to how the semantic undergoer of each clause is coded. In example
87
   Bender (1983, p. 144f) also makes reference to an impersonal paradigm in Majang, but this
   is not the form presented here, but a generally correct analysis of some verbs with an imper-
   sonal meaning that require a dative short pronoun or the deictic-transfer directional form to
   refer to the semantic subject.
88
   In line with its main function as a backgrounding device for the A, the impersonal form is
   best translated into English by the use of the passive.
240                             Chapter IV.2a) the undergoer appears to be a preposed demonstrative, preceded by a
contrastive pronoun. It cannot be determined what case the undergoer has in
this clause, as demonstratives and contrastive pronouns show no case mark-
ing. In example b) the undergoer is the following speech clause, as the hear-
ers are coded as dative. Again, the undergoer case cannot be determined
from the morphology employed. But in examples c) and d), the undergoer is
both times clearly indicated not as the S, but the P of the clause: in c) as a
topical NP (as revealed by the disjoint form on the verb) followed by an ab-
solutive possessive pronoun, and in d) as a short pronoun (see section
IV.3.1.1). Example c) would have the NP in the nominative case if this were
the S of the clause, but the possessive pronoun form unambiguously identi-
fies the case as absolutive. In example e) the marking as S or P is ambiguous
again, as the absolutive case is expected for non-topical S or P alike.
If the marker -ɛːL were a passive marker, one would expect the undergoer to
be coded as S in the absolutive or nominative case. Instead, it only comes in
the absolutive case, and only as a P. This is not in line with how the passive
is often defined. Perlmutter and Postal’s (1983, p. 9) first universal of passiv-
ization states that “a direct object of an active clause is the (superficial)
subject of the ‘corresponding’ clause.” In the Majang impersonal construc-
tions, the direct object of the corresponding active clause is still the direct
object. The construction is at least formally transitive, although the A is
heavily backgrounded to the point of almost not being there. It is expressed,
still as an A, by the impersonal person marker -ɛːL in the subject slot of the
verb. This leads to the analysis of the construction as impersonal, not pas-
sive, in this description of Majang.
There are two needs that languages address by using the passive. The first
one is of a syntactic nature: to make a P-NP available for use in equi-NP de-
letion (Anderson, 1976, p. 8). The Majang language makes no use of equi-
NP deletion. Even if the Majang language had a need for equi-NP deletion,
the impersonal form could not be used to set up a P for this purpose. The
syntactic subject of the clause is not the P argument of the verb; it is still
stuck in a non-subject role and can therefore not be used as the pivot for an-
other clause.
This leaves the second function of the passive, the backgrounding of a non-
topical A, to be accomplished by the impersonal form of Majang. That this is
the main function of the impersonal form is confirmed by the fact that not a
single instance of an impersonal construction in the text corpus has the A
                                      Verbs                                     241overtly mentioned beyond the impersonal marker on the verb, as can be seen
in the examples above.
Although the impersonal construction leaves the clause superficially transi-
tive, semantically and pragmatically the A is left out of the picture, rendering
the clause quite intransitive according to the criteria established by Hopper
and Thompson (1980).
Although impersonal forms are in this study usually translated by using the
English passive, it is clearly not a derivational, but an inflectional device.
This is in contrast to real valence-changing devices of Majang, such as the
antipassive (see section V.5.1). The impersonal marker is placed at the end
of each verb, often following other inflection markers such as subordinate-
tense markers. This is not consistent with a derivation device, which would
usually be marked closer to the verb root than any inflection markers. The
most fruitful analysis therefore sees the impersonal marker as a person mark-
er filling the same slot as other person markers. This becomes especially ob-
vious in example IV.150 below, where the impersonal marker is integrated
into the relative-past morpheme in the same way as any other person marker.
The impersonal verb is the same for all P persons, either taking the short
suffix -ɛL or the long suffix -ɛːL, both with a fixed high tone for disjoint
forms, and -ɛ/-ɛː with a low tone for conjoint forms. The form is not subject
to height harmony, as it is not just restricted to ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs.
Example IV.146: impersonal construction
   nɛ bòːlɛːL wárL nɛ dùrìjé kɛ “wěː!”
   nɛ    bòːl-ɛːL wárL           nɛ dùrìj-ɛ   kɛ       wěː
   CONJ hit-IMPS.DJ dog\SG.ABS CONJ cry-3S.DJ QUOT     ouch!
   Dog was beaten and cried out “ouch!”
All person differences regarding the P are expressed by free short personal
pronouns (see section IV.3.1.1). Third persons (not marked by short pro-
nouns, as these come only in first and second person forms) may of course
be expressed by a full NP in the absolutive case. The topicality status of the
P triggers conjoint and disjoint marking on the impersonal verb form.

These examples show the impersonal form accompanied by short pronouns,
which require a disjoint form of the verb. These pronouns can also appear in
front of the impersonal verb.

"This example is a full sentence consisting of one main clause. The verb form
looks exactly like the relative-past form, which, however, cannot make up a
main-clause verb. So the form serves a different purpose in this example,
providing object reference to the participant that was the subject of the pre-
vious sentence.

reference is made clear in the first clause. The syntactic status of this first
mention can be both S or P.

"The conjoint form of the 3S suffix in example a) has a low tone. The disjoint
form instead has a fixed high tone (example b).
These examples show that tone plays a major role in the Majang language,
and needs to be considered very carefully in order to understand not only the
phonology, but also the morphology and the syntax of the language.",[104]
"In this conditional construction the protasis precedes the apodosis, which is
the normal order in Majang. Both clauses are followed by a clitic =ŋ, but in
the case of the protasis this is the conditional marker, whereas at the end of
the main clause it is the SFT-clitic.
                              Clause Combinations                                  401It is rewarding to consider whether these two clitics are actually the same.
This should be the obvious conclusion drawn from Haiman’s (1978) well-
defended assumption that conditional clauses (=protases) are topics, as they
provide the presuppositional context under which the apodosis holds true. He
therefore warns us to expect that in some languages the conditional markers
are identical to the topical markers (Haiman, 1978, p. 577). In light of this
the identity of the conditional marker and the sentence-final topicality mark-
er in Majang certainly goes well beyond the scope of mere coincidence.
Therefore, if I do not gloss them in the same way, it is not because I disagree
with Haiman’s assessment and don’t want to apply it to the Majang lan-
guage, but in order to avoid confusion among the readers who rightly note
that this conditional marker behaves quite differently from the SFT-clitic. This
usually ends the sentence, which the conditional marker decidedly does not.
Because of its very different scope over the whole clause, the conditional
marker can appear on NPs which are not topical, as in example V.128 above.
Accordingly, in spite of their apparent common origin, the conditional clitic
and the sentence-final topicality clitic behave differently enough to warrant a
different gloss.
There are different kinds of conditional constructions in Majang. The follow-
ing sections contain examples of those which were encountered in the cor-
pus. Most of them have in common that they are introduced by the conjunc-
tion ɔ̀kɔ̀n ‘if’, and that they have the protasis followed by the clitic =ŋ.","[406, 407]"
"In this example the initial sentence introduces the main character of the nar-
rative, by using a full NP giving the necessary information about this partici-
pant. In the next clause this participant is then an activated participant, and
topical continuity allows the participant to be no longer mentioned overtly
except by indexing on the verb. Adjustments are only necessary when new
participants are introduced, or when different participants become activated
in rapid succession.
A participant can keep its activated status as object in the next clause by the
use of the referential-object verb form (see section IV.2.3.5).

410                               Chapter V.9This referential-object verb form, which is formally identical with the rela-
tive-past subordinate form, but syntactically very different from it, almost
appears like an object marker. But the form is the same for all possible ob-
ject persons. Instead of providing anaphoric reference through indexing for a
specific participant it alerts the hearer to the fact that the object is identical
with the subject or object of the previous clause. The following example
shows the use of the referential-object form for reference to the preceding
object.

IV.3.9.2 Adverbial conjunction
In the Majang language many clause-level adverbials are not case-marked
noun phrases or prepositional phrases, but mini-clauses which consist of no
more than a verb, stative verb or numeral, and which are not treated as inde-
pendent clauses. They clearly are placed in the adverbial slot of the clause
and are introduced by the clause-internal conjunction à. These adverbials
have a very different status from the adverbial clauses presented in section
V.8.3. For example they can never precede the clause they belong to.
Example IV.299: clause-internal conjunction used for adverbials

adverbial consisting of a stative verb (see section IV.2.4.2 for this construc-
tion) and in c) it almost serves like a preposition introducing a comitative
NP. All three examples have in common that the adverbial phrase introduced
by the conjunction à appears at the end of the total clause, where one would
expect adverbial information.

Part V: Other Syntactic and Pragmatic TopicsThis part of the language description deals with the use of the various forms
explored in the previous sections, focusing on what they accomplish mostly
from a functional perspective. Section V.1 investigates the structure of the
noun phrase, and section V.2 does the same for verb phrases. In section V.3,
the structure of the various kinds of simple clauses is presented, and section
V.4 surveys the semantic functions of various noun phrases. Sections V.5 to
V.6 briefly deal with further syntactic topics (valence-changing construc-
tions and tense, aspect and mode). Section V.7 lists a number of pragmatical-
ly marked structures, such as fronting, negation, questions, focus and imper-
atives. Section V.8 investigates the various ways to combine clauses to com-
plex sentences, and section V.9 addresses topics relating to topical continuity
and discontinuity.","[332, 333, 334, 335]"
"If both examples really had the same case marking, then the modifiers
should also be the same, which they are not. Of course it could be claimed
that the case marking only happens on the modifier as the last element of the
NP, not the head noun. Such an analysis would only work for the possessed
nominative/ergative case forms if the case marking elsewhere in modified
noun phrases is ignored. But many modifiers are not case-marked, and for
other cases the case marking happens also on the head noun; furthermore,
the noun forms of modified ergative/nominative nouns are still different
from the noun forms of other cases, plain or modified. It is therefore more in
line with the analysis of other modified NPs to assume that modified nomi-
native and ergative nouns are case marked for either nominative or ergative,
which is also reflected by the glossing in the examples.
All plain nominative nouns shown so far were presented preceding the ad-
verb kɛkàr ‘again’, in order to show them in their untarnished non-final posi-
tion. But in many situations an unmodified nominative-case noun appears at
the end of a sentence, and then it is accompanied by the sentence-final topi-
cality marker (SFT, see section III.4). The following examples show the same
as IV.79a) without the adverb, and two more different subjects:

"II.6 ToneMajang has two distinctive tone levels, which are called high and low (H and
L). High tones can be both automatically and non-automatically down-
stepped in various situations (see section II.6.2). Falling and rising tones are
created by combining high and low tones on the same syllable, which hap-
pens only at the end of a phonological word.
Roots of nouns and verbs are accompanied by different tonal melodies, as
seen in the following examples. The number following the tone pattern indi-
cates the frequency of occurrence in a 485-item sample of noun stems.
Example II.23: noun-tone melodies, as seen on bisyllabic and monosyllabic roots

19
   Pre-pausal low tones have a slight falling contour in Majang, which is of a purely phonetic
   nature. See also example d).
20
   A HL melody was only found on monosyllabic noun roots with a long vowel. Some erga-
   tive noun stems, such as tɔ̀n ‘child (ERG)’ have short vowels with a HL sequence. LH
   melodies do not exist on monosyllabic noun roots at all.

      c) LH ràgád prepare          []
As can be seen here, the noun roots appear to be tonally more varied than the
verb roots, which only come in the three different patterns L, H and LH. The
pattern L occurs 235 times in a 355- item sample of verb stems, H 98 times,
and LH 22 times.
Although all lexical roots are accompanied by lexical tones, some affixes are
underlyingly toneless, and then copy the tone of the preceding syllable (see
section II.6.3).
Based on the available evidence, it is very difficult to decide which of the
two tones is marked or unmarked. The frequency of the tones certainly does
not help in this matter. In the 2879-word text sample, the high tone appears
only slightly more frequently on short vowels (1894 times) than the low tone
(1847 times). On long vowels the frequency differs, though, with 668 high
tones, compared to only 366 low tones. Contour tones are much less fre-
quent, with 55 falling tones (HL) on short vowels balanced by 76 on long
vowels, and 21 rising tones (LH) on short vowels compared to 29 on long
vowels.
In order to read the examples given in this section, it may be necessary to
first understand the tone-orthography conventions used in this study. These
are explained in section II.9.","[92, 93]"
"
II.2.3 Distribution
Before discussing the distribution of consonants, it is necessary to give some
information on syllable, root and word structure in anticipation of sections
II.4 and II.7. Syllables can be open and closed, and there can be two-conso-
nant clusters both word-medially and word-finally. Two-consonant clusters
can also appear inside a morpheme, as in the verb stem dèrt ‘slide’. Words
can be monomorphemic, but frequently include suffixes and even enclitics.
Prefixes are very rarely encountered; these always end in a vowel. Noun and
verb roots are often monosyllabic, but can consist of several syllables.
Most consonants can appear in all environments. There are, however, some
limited distributions which are difficult to explain. Only a very small number
of words end in a labial consonant, and except for the adverb otoːp ‘often’,
and the noun ɟoːpL ‘people’, no words end in a labial obstruent. The labial
nasal /m/ does appear word-finally in about 20 words, but this is balanced by
the more than 200 words ending in the alveolar nasal /n/. Between vowels
and in word-initial position /m/ is by far the most frequent nasal.
More transparent is the fact that at the end of a word, non-palatal voiced
obstruents are not permitted phonetically. If an underlying voiced obstruent
appears in that position, it is devoiced, such as íɟàːgL ‘work’, which is pro-
nounced [iɟàːkʰ], in this way creating a neutralization not unlike obstruent
hardening in other languages, such as German. The speakers do not appear
to be aware of that alternation; so this process seems to be of a postlexical
nature – see chapter 7 of Mohanan (1986) for evidence that speaker judg-
ments are linked to the lexical level of phonological representations.
                                  Consonants                                    73All consonants appear in good numbers word-initially and between vowels,
except for the alveolar nasal /n/, which surprisingly appears word-initially in
only about a dozen lexemes, as opposed to nearly ninety for / m/, 21 for /ɲ/
and 34 for /ŋ/. Except for the assimilation of alveolar nasals to the velar
place of articulation (see section II.5.1), nasals keep their place of articula-
tion, both inside the root and at morpheme boundaries: for example, ámɗL
‘stomach’ and ɗàmɗú ‘after he ate’ show /m/ maintaining its labial place of
articulation preceding alveolar phonemes. The two reduplicated verb stems
tíntím ‘fold’ and tɔ̀ntɔ̀m ‘incubate’, however, suggest that some assimilation
happens preceding alveolar consonants inside a stem. No other instances
were encountered where any nasal assimilates to another place of articula-
tion. tɛmk ‘it is small (SUB)’ shows /m/ stable in front of a velar consonant.
The alveolar nasal can be encountered preceding palatal consonants, as in
pàrànɟíL ‘white person’. The palatal nasal was encountered preceding / k/ in
kóːɲkàn ‘cursed person’. The velar nasal was sometimes found preceding al-
veolar phonemes, as in the stem cɔ̀ːlíláŋtL ‘vulture (NOM)’. It appears that
Majang can be characterized as a split system regarding nasal assimilation,
with a clear assimilation of alveolar nasals towards velar nasals, and a gener-
al lack of assimilation between other places of articulation.
In consonant clusters across syllable boundaries, there is a high tendency for
having sonorants as first consonant (C1) and obstruents as second consonant
(C2), as in words like tàmàːrɛrkí ‘they learn’ or, twice, in ɓànkàwkà ‘power’.
Obstruents can only be found as C1 when C2 is also an obstruent, as in
táːpꜜtáːnákL ‘letters’ or ìɟáːgkɛL ‘when they started to work’. In the same way,
sonorants also only appear as C2 when C1 is another sonorant, as in
mérménáːꜜrá ‘I notice’ or ɓòkóːrjántáL ‘tortoise (DAT)’.
Implosives usually appear as C2 in a consonant cluster. An alveolar im-
plosive /ɗ/ cannot be found preceding another consonant within the same
word. It is changed to the flap /r/, as in eːŋàɗàːŋ ‘I smell’ vs. eːŋàrŋ ‘he
smells’. The labial implosive /ɓ/ is rarely found preceding consonants. The
only example encountered in the text corpus is gàgáɓkɛjgíɗáL ‘whenever I
give her’. Moges (2006, p. 829) points oùt thàt in spite of these restrictions

nant clusters, C1 needs to be a [+SONORANT]13 consonant. If C1 is /l/ or a
nasal, then C2 can be a [- SONORANT] consonant (including implosives), or the
nasal /ŋ/ (such as in ɛltL ‘grassland’, emɗ ‘canoe’ or tà*mŋ ‘it drips’). If C1 is
a [- NASAL], [- LATERAL] sonorant /r, j, w/, then only /ŋ/ and /n/ can be found in
the C2 position, as in ko*wŋ ‘he digs’, kàːrnL ‘war’, ɓɛjnL ‘thorn’, or ɗɛjŋL
‘cooking stone’. The restrictions on word-final consonant clusters are entire-
ly in line with the sonority hierarchy proposed by Lowenstamm (1981),
which predicts the following order for syllable codas: approximant – sono-
rant – nasal – obstruent. Two phonemes from the same level can combine to
a consonant cluster. This is exactly what can be seen in Majang, giving the
implosives a special status as being neither a sonorant nor an obstruent,
placing them between nasals and obstruents.
The language strongly disfavors a syllable rhyme containing both a long
vowel and a consonant cluster14. If these two things come together in any
configuration, the vowel is shortened. This can be observed for example in
the locative form of ŋédàn ‘bee’, which makes use of the non-central case
stem /ŋédàːn/, to which the locative stem extension -t is added, resulting in
the form *ŋédàːnt, which is shortened to ŋédànt.","[78, 79, 80]"
"V.7.4 Orders and hortatives
The Majang language has a dedicated paradigm for imperative and jussive
forms (see section IV.2.3.4 for their formation). These are frequently used,
but Majang speakers have additional options to exhort people to do what
they want.
Majang imperative and jussive clauses have in common that they never show
a sentence-final topicality clitic (SFT).

Imperatives are used to give direct orders to second-person speech-act parti-
cipants.

II.6.2 Downstep
Majang uses downstep, both automatic and non-automatic. Whenever a H
follows a surface L, its register is lowered, so that the H is pronounced on a
lower pitch than any preceding H in the same clause. At clause boundaries,
the register is reset. This is called automatic downstep.
There are also many instances, however, when a high tone following a high
tone has its register lowered. There appear to be two different causes for this:
1. Some morphemes are accompanied by a floating low tone, which is not
   audible on the word itself, but which lowers the register of the following
   word. This non-automatic downstep usually22 operates across word
   boundaries.
       Example II.26: non-automatic downstep caused by floating low tones
         a) béàL nàːk     my spear         [   ]                 HL H
          b)     bolbol nàːk    my calf of leg     []                 H       H
22
     Example IV.24 presents an analysis where the floating L is assumed to manifest itself on an
     attached suffix.
                                     Tone                                      89    In both examples, a noun with a final H is followed by the 1S.SG.ABS pos-
    sessive pronoun, which also has an inherent H. In example a), this high
    tone on the pronoun is downstepped, whereas in example b), it is on the
    same register as the preceding high tone. In order to account for this dif-
    ference, it is necessary to assume that the noun in example a) is accom-
    panied by some device that lowers the register for the rest of the clause.
    The noun in example b), however, is not accompanied by such a regis-
    ter-lowering device. For the purposes of this section, it is not important
    to decide whether this device lowering the register is part of the preced-
    ing noun stem or an affix that is only attached to the nouns of a particu-
    lar inflection class (see the section on singular marking on p. 150 for
    more information). In either case, the proposed analysis assumes that the
    noun in example a) is accompanied by a floating L that causes the lower-
    ing of the register on the following possessive pronoun. This floating L
    is absent in example b), and no phonological reason beyond posing such
    a floating L can be identified that determines which noun causes a
    downstep and which doesn’t. In this study, I call this kind of non-auto-
    matic downstep word downstep, as it crosses word boundaries. In the
    2879-word text sample, this kind of downstep occurs 882 times. As this
    floating low tone is a part of the lexical material of the utterance, it is in
    this study always written (with the superscript L), even if it does not have
    a phonetic effect preceding words beginning with a low tone.
2. When two separate underlying high tones come together within a word
   across morpheme boundaries, the first syllable of the second morpheme
   is affected by a lowering of the register. This happens in order to avoid
   an obvious violation of the Obligatory Contour Principle. Cahill (2004,
   p. 5) lists a number of other African languages (Kishambaa, Supyire and
   Namwanga) which share this behavior. The situation in Namwanga par-
   ticularly mirrors the evidence in Majang (Bickmore, 2000, p. 302f). This
   non-automatic downstep only operates between morphemes within a
   word. Two high tones meeting across word boundaries do not trigger
   downstep if no floating L is involved (see example II.26b). The analysis
   proposed here does not assume the presence of a floating L between the
   two underlying high tones triggering the morpheme downstep. Such a
   floating L is present neither underlyingly, nor as a product of a phono-
   logical rule creating the downstep. The downstep is a lowering of the
   register, and is not caused by the insertion of an unrealized low tone.
   This agrees in principle with Odden’s (1986, p. 366) interpretation of the
90                               Chapter II.6      facts in Kishambaa. This form of non-automatic downstep is therefore
      fundamentally different from the word downstep introduced above, and
      is accordingly indicated by a different orthographic symbol (ꜜ).
      Example II.27: non-automatic downstep within a word
         coːꜜmoj tree, sp.         []          H   H
      This noun consists of the root morpheme plus the non-productive nomi-
      nalizer -oj (see example IV.125). I call this kind of non-automatic down-
      step morpheme downstep, as it crosses morpheme boundaries only, but
      never word boundaries. This kind of downstep is much less frequent
      than the word downstep, with only 87 occurrences in the 2879-word text
      sample.
Both types of non-automatic downstep may involve the same word, as the
following noun phrase illustrates:
Example II.28: combination of downsteps
     wákàꜜcàkɛL      gàːnɛ      [   ]
     {wákàc-àk-ɛ L
                       gàːn-ɛ }
                              L
     crossroads-PL-LOC POSS\1S.PL-LOC
     at my crossroadsThis example has two downsteps operating on the noun wákàꜜcàkɛL. The first
downstep following the stem wàkàc is caused by the addition of the plural
suffix -àk, which has its own underlying high tone. The high tone on wàkàc
spreads out over both syllables of the stem and therefore stays on the same
register. The presence of the new H on -àk is announced by the morpheme
downstep between the two morphemes. The H on -àk spreads out to the next
morpheme, the toneless locative marker -ɛL. As no new tone is involved, the
register stays the same on the two syllables -àkɛL. Although the locative
marker -ɛL is toneless as such, and therefore available for the copying of the
H on -àk, it is accompanied by a floating low tone. This floating L then
causes the H on gàːnɛL to be downstepped, according to the principle of word
downstep.
Although minimal pairs entirely based on non-automatic downstep are rare,
they do exist. Quite frequently the contrast is used for the paradigmatic dis-
tinction between absolutive nouns (ABS) and nominative nouns (NOM).

  a) ɗɛnà     wàrL             kɛkàr.             [     ]
     {ɗɛn-à wàrL               kɛkàr}

     I see a dog again.

     bite-AP.3S dog\SG.NOM          again
     The dog bites again.
In both examples, the noun wàr ‘dog’ is followed by the same adverb kɛkàr,
which begins with a H and therefore serves well as an indicator for downstep
caused by preceding words. Downstep of kɛkàr happens in example a), but
not in example b), which illustrates that the forms for absolutive and nomi-
native can be subtly different for some nouns (other nouns do not display
that difference through downstep, if at all – see section IV.1.3.1 for details
on how the various noun forms are distinguished morphologically).
The two different kinds of non-automatic downstep in Majang provide an
excellent tool for determining word boundaries in Majang. This is illustrated
by the following examples, where the absence of a downstep between the
words of example d) proves to be crucial:
Example II.30: downstep and word boundaries
  a) ɗeːgàríː                  [   ]      we sleep
     {ɗeːgàr-í ,ːL}
     sleep-1P.DJ
  b) ɗeːgàríː kɔ̀              [   ]      we just slept
     {ɗeːgàr-í ,ːL    kɔ̀}

     {ɗeːgàr-àrí}
     sleep-2P.DJ
  d) ɗeːgàràrí kɔ̀            [   ]     you just slept
                                                      PL
     {ɗeːgàr-àrí kɔ̀}
     sleep-2P.DJ RECPST
These examples show that the recent past marker kɔ̀ always carries a high
tone, regardless of the preceding tones, which implies that the high tone is
92                                    Chapter II.6part of the underlying representation of this marker. It is also shown that the
H on kɔ̀ is not downstepped following a high-toned morpheme (example d).
This proves that the morpheme downstep does not apply to the marker kɔ̀,
which in turn proves that kɔ̀ is neither a suffix nor a clitic, as it was analyzed
by Bender (1983, p. 134) or Unseth (1989b, p. 108), but an independent
word (the same can be assumed, by extension, for all other tense markers of
the language).
Unfortunately, the neat picture presented so far is disturbed by a number of
verbal paradigms where the application of the morpheme-downstep rule does
not suffice to explain the tonal variation between stems lexically ending on a
high tone and those ending on a low tone. The following examples are taken
from the relative-past paradigms presented in example IV.165.
Example II.31: unexplained tonal behavior in some complex verbal paradigms
     a)        {ped} ‘finish’ L-melody
          1S   pèdíːɗàL     {ped-íːɗ-àL} after I had finished     b)        {ìbáːl} ‘play’ LH-melody
          1S   ìbáːlíːɗàL   {ìbáːl-íːɗ-àL} after I had played
Both examples take i-class stems ending on a consonant and add the relative-
past marker -íːɗ, followed by the toneless 1S person marker -àL. Example a)
gives the impression that the relative-past marker has an underlying high
tone, which is realized without modification following the low-toned stem
pèd ‘finish’. But following a stem ending on a high tone, as in example b)
following ìbáːl ‘play’, the suffix high tone is not downstepped, as one would
expect after the application of the morpheme-downstep rule. These examples
suggest the presence of a phonological word boundary between the stem and
the relative-past marker, but such a boundary has no place in these examples,
because the syllabification treats the relative-past verbs as single words – it
is not reasonable to assume a phonological word boundary inside the syl-
lables /díː/ (a) and /líː/ (b). One could also assume a tone merger of the two
high tones as a strategy to avoid a violation of the Obligatory Contour Prin-
ciple (OCP), but the language does not make use of this strategy elsewhere.
Another unsatisfactory way to describe what is happening is to assume two
tonal allomorphs of the relative-past marker: one allomorph has an under-
lying high tone in the environment of a stem-final low tone. The other allo-
morph is toneless in the environment of a stem-final high tone, and it
                                            Tone                                            93therefore copies the stem tone without triggering the morpheme-downstep.
This allomorphy rule is suffering from a lack of phonological motivation.
A better way to look at this assumes that morphemes with this behavior fol-
low a tone-replacement rule that replaces all stem tones with the high tone of
the morpheme until it is blocked by a stem L. The morpheme -íːɗ (from now
on marked with the super-high tone marker to indicate its tone-replacement
behavior) replaces the stem tones by its own high tone. In example II.31a),
this is blocked by the low tone on the stem, and in example b), it succeeds
for the second stem syllable, which has an underlying H, but not for the first
syllable of the stem, which has a blocking L. The absence of word-internal
downstep in this word makes any analysis that maintains the association of
the original stem H untenable.
This behavior is restricted to the more complex verb paradigms involving
subordinate-tense forms or direction markers (section IV.2.3). These will be
marked by the super-high tone marker, just as some other morphemes
(particularly infinitive and noun-plural markers) whose tone-replacement be-
havior is not blocked by low tones on the stem.","[94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"
"In this example Hyena appears as the P of the clause in the absolutive case;
somewhat surprisingly, though, the use of the conjoint marking (see section
III.3) on the preceding verb ‘bite’ clearly shows Hyena to be non-topical. It
should not be assumed that by this time the accessibility of Hyena has waned
– he is still an activated participant at this point in the narrative; but the
speaker chooses to mark the NP ‘hyena’ as non-topical. This is in line with
the previously introduced definition of topicality that makes use of the con-
cept of expectedness: Hyena turns out to be the unexpected object of killing
violence; the unexpectedness of this participant in the P role overrides its
discourse accessibility in the evaluation of its topicality.
These examples were picked to show that there are some factors that for
most clauses explain from the pragmatic context why a particular topicality
status is placed on a given NP. The last example makes it clear that topicality
in Majang is not entirely defined by factors such as accessibility and themat-
ic importance, as proposed by Givón (1990, p. 902ff). Apparently the choice
of the speaker can be influenced by other factors as well, and here I make
use of the concept of expectedness, as introduced by McGregor (2010, p.
1622), in the language-specific definition of Majang topicality. This can only
be a preliminary assessment. More research on a wider textual basis will lead
to a clearer understanding, and even this will eventually be subject to the de-
liberate choice of a speaker to assign or not assign topicality in a given situa-
tion, based on factors arising from the pragmatic context of the utterance
(compare McGregor’s (2010, p. 1624) explanation for his example 17).
108                                  Chapter III.1New participants are introduced as non-topical in all analyzed narrative texts
(it should be possible to introduce well-known participants as topical,
though). Nominal predicates (section V.3.2.1) are always coded as non-topi-
cal in the analyzed data, but the existence of topical predicates cannot be ex-
cluded, given the shortage of data.
It is important to remember that the concept of topicality in Majang cannot
be equated with the pragmatic category of topic as introduced in the typolo-
gy proposed by Li and Thompson (1976, p. 483ff). Majang is not a topic-
prominent language according to this typology, as topicality in Majang never
competes with the subject in its primary role of structuring the clause. Also,
as seen in example III.3, it is possible to have two or more topical entities in
a Majang clause, or none in a thetical clause, whereas topic-prominent lan-
guages identify exactly one topic per clause, which serves as the syntactic
pivot. Not surprisingly, therefore, the Majang language does not meet many
of the eight criteria (Li & Thompson, 1976, pp. 466–471) defining a topic-
prominent language. Majang must be classified as a subject-prominent lan-
guage, but one in which topical constituents have a great impact on the syn-
tactic configuration of the clause.","[113, 114]"
"
IV.1.3.1 Number marking
Majang distinguishes between singular and plural. All elements of the noun
phrase show number agreement with the head noun, and subject marking on
                                   Nouns                                   149the verb also agrees with the number of the referenced entity. Number mark-
ing was treated by Bender (1983, pp. 124–127) and in more detail by Unseth
(1988b). These works are generally adequate, but because of their lack of
tone marking they missed some morphological distinctions. Getachew
(2014, p. 94ff) filled some of these gaps by providing information on the role
of tone in number marking. All three previous approaches are similar to each
other in separating the issue of number marking from case marking. It is
shown in section IV.1.3.2 that such a treatment cannot do justice to the
morphological processes operating on Majang nouns; therefore I provide pa-
radigms of case marking together with number-marking allomorphs. A com-
plete picture of number-case combinations is presented in section IV.1.3.3.
A number-marking system as complex as the one encountered in Majang
opens up the question whether it can really be seen as an inflectional device.
One could alternatively consider treating it as a lexical process, possibly in-
volving derivation devices that create different singular and plural stems, as
suggested by Hayward (1981, p. 128f) for Dirayta. I treat it as an inflectional
category, mostly in order to present it together with other inflectional cat-
egories such as case and modification, which often combine to portmanteau
formatives with the number markers. Furthermore, in spite of the multitude
of number formatives, particularly for the plural, some generalizations can
be made about how they are applied. The number of nouns with a number-
marking behavior that is not copied by at least one other noun is very small.
Furthermore, singular and plural marking generally come to predictable
meanings entirely centered around the dimension of grammatical number.
Number marking is obligatory in Majang – single referents require a singular
form, and multiple referents require a plural form. Almost every noun is
clearly identifiable for its number value. Most nouns have a singular root and
a marked plural, but for some it is the other way around. For a number of
nouns both forms are morphologically marked. Some nouns only come in
either a singular or a plural form, and for a few nouns number marking hap-
pens through suppletion. Majang therefore clearly exhibits the – according to
Dimmendaal (2000, p. 216) – prototypical number-marking characteristics
of a Nilo-Saharan language.
Which form of number marking is chosen for each noun seems to be mostly
a lexical decision. But, as Unseth (1988b, p. 79) points out, “some generali-
zations concerning various plural noun classes are noticeable. Some of the
plural classes are grouped by phonological criteria and others by semantic
150                                 Chapter IV.1criteria.” Such generalizations, however, are not more than tendencies, and
if such tendencies are observable for a particular marker, they are indicated
in the section dealing with this marker.
As a basis for all numerical information given in the sections below, 719
nouns were analyzed for their number-marking behavior.","[154, 155, 156]"
