       Hidatsa and Crow prefix order in causative constructions is of interest from theperspective of comparative Siouan, since in Lakota the prefix for the causee goes on thecausative marker, not at the beginning of the whole stem; only prefixes for the object of thecausative verb go at the beginning of the whole stem.",[242]
"       Besides word order, Hidatsa relies on two strategies to disambiguate overtly expressedclausal arguments. The first strategy relies on the relative ranking on the animacy scale (see 9.6.1)and the second one on the relative ranking on the agentivity scale (see 9.6.2) .",[401]
        The combination of the indefinite maa- and the relativizing aru- derives abstract nounsfrom active transitive verbs. The indefinite prefix in the Object slot of the relativized transitiveverb is necessary in order to meet the subcategorization requirement. Examples are in (80).,[353]

"5.1 Split-intransitivityFrom a typological perspective, Hidatsa is a split-intransitive type language (also known as anactive-stative type language). This means that the core arguments of a clause are marked by twotypes of pronominal prefixes that are grouped into two sets: the A-set prefixes (1 maa-, 2 ná-, 3 Ø)mark the transitive agent and the subject of the first subset of intransitive verbs, whereas the B-set prefixes (1 mii-, 2 nii-, 3 Ø) mark the transitive object as well as the subject of the secondsubset of intransitive verbs. The primary principle that divides intransitives into the two subsetsis based on control: the S-argument is marked like an agent (A) if the subject is in control of theintransitive activity; it is marked like a transitive object (O) if the subject is not in control of anintransitive activity49. Since the grammatical subject S is marked by two different types ofprefixes, such a system is also known as a split-S alignment.",[234]
"       Coordination of verb phrases, unlike the coordination of noun phrases, is usuallyasymmetric, i.e., the order of the coordinates cannot be changed without a significant effect onthe interpretation of the coordination. This is because there is an implication that the sequence ofclauses closely matches the sequence of events they describe.",[548]
"       In other words, in a split-transitive system some subjects of intransitive verbs are treatedin the same way that subjects of transitive verbs are treated, while other subjects of intransitiveverbs are treated in the same way that objects of transitive verbs are treated.",[232]
"        Finally, there is an interesting group of Hidatsa personal names that are formed with thevertitive goal suffix in order to express the wish that one return to his or her roots. Examples are(38a-c).",[524]

"       The ergative pronoun is also used for emphasis and to assign contrastive focus to aspecific referent in order to differentiate it from other possible referents. In emphatic andcontrastive clauses the presence of the ergative pronoun indicates that, although the agent iseasily indentifiable, its particular referent rather than some other is being singled out. In Englishthe equivalent effect is achieved by stressing the appropriate pronoun or by the clefted phrase.",[436]

Examples of instrumental compounds that are derived from stative bases but may have atransitive internal structure are given in (95).

   which one / that rings)                                              < dawúá ring like a bell
      maaˀiixawúá rattle (lit. something with which one / that rattles) < xawúá rattle        Instrumental compounds are sometimes reduced to a single phonological word in casualspeech along with all concomitant phonological processes, such vowel deletion in complex stems(see 2.4.2) and pitch spreading (see 2.3.1). Examples are in (96).
(395) migháá iibácaadi > mighiibácaadi pitchfork < migháá grass, bácaadi poke sth
      migháá iiracgiidí > mighiicgiidí   lawn mower < migháá grass, nacgiidí clip sth

Inexample (97), the transitive stem bháàhgee to signal something is preceded by the mostfrequently encountered sequence whereby maa- precedes ii-. In example (98), however, theprefix order is reversed, possibly because bháàhgee was first detransitivized with the indefiniteprefix maa- (maabháàhgee to be signaling) and only then was the instrumental prefix ii- addedto the derived intransitive stem.
(396) maaˀiibháàhge             turn signal < bháàhgee to signal sth(397) iiwaabháàhge              turn signal < maabháàhge to be signaling

       Instrumental compounds, just like all Hidatsa compounds, are inherently recursive. Theliteral translation of the Hidatsa word for ‘cement’ in (99) is ‘something with which to mix [themass] with which one smears the house’.

Prototypical proper nouns includepersonal names, place names, and names of any other unique entities. Proper nouns may bederived from words belonging to any lexical category; they may occur as individual words,compounds, or phrases. What sets proper names apart from other types of nominals is that, beinguniquely identifiable in most contexts, they usually occur with the definite determiner -s unlessthe name is used predicatively or as a vocative. Examples of personal names are seen in (100),place names in (101), and other types of names in (102).","[358, 359, 360]"

3 Verb classificationTypologically, Hidatsa is an active-stative type language. In transitive clauses the transitiveAgent (A) is marked with one set of pronominal prefixes and the transitive Object (O) withanother. The single argument in intransitive clauses, the intransitive Subject (S), is marked forsome verbs like (A) and for some verbs like (O). This type of morphosyntactic alignment is oftenreferred to as the Split Intransitive, or simply as Split-S (Dixon 1979: 82).","[91, 92]"
"       For several decades, Robinett’s work remained a singular achievement in Hidatsalinguistics. She describes the language within the framework of American structuralism,specifically the item-and-arrangement model and templatic morphology. Each affix is assigned aposition number in the template. Each position or “slot” consists of mutually exclusive affixesthat have to occur in a fixed order relative to all other affixal “slots”. Robinett uses metaterms todescribe all the affixes according to their function, but gives very few actual examples of affixalcombinations (she does it in a more abstract manner, e.g., affixes x, y, and z may co-occur insuch-and-such (e.g., active) stems. Nevertheless, it is possible to use her work for textualanalysis, even if the process is quite laborious.",[34]
"       The relative agentive values on the scale are presented in (39). Note that the attributivedemonstratives (e.g., -hee, éèhgu, éèraga, etc.) are ranked equally with the definite article -s.
(39)   -rí ERG > -s DEF / DEM > -wa INDEF > Ø       The order of outside arguments in a transitive clause is not important since the A-argument is always disambiguated by its higher ranking on the agentivity scale relative to the O-argument. Thus ‘the cat’ in (40a) and (40b), marked with the definite -s, is always recognized asthe Agent regardless of its relative position in the clause since it outranks the unmarked O-argument ‘mouse’.",[402]
"Speech-act suffixes and evidential enclitics (see 6.2) are not necessarily sentence final sinceother constituents of the sentence may follow the verb and the illocutionary suffix. Examples (1)and (2) illustrate variation in word order.

"9.6 Argument disambiguationIn Hidatsa, the nominal clause arguments Agent, Subject, and Object are regularly omitted ifthey are recoverable from the pragmatic context, preceding text, or from grammatical concord,                                                                                                   376
therefore transitive constructions where both nominal arguments (Agent and Object) are overtlyrealized are not common. New participants are often introduced as subjects of intransitiveclauses (e.g., “and then N came’) or objects of transitive clauses (e.g., ‘and then he saw N’). Afterthe new participant has been introduced, it seldom occurs as an overt noun phrase, unless theparticipant structure needs to be refreshed after some other participant intervenes.       (36) is a passage from a traditional trickster story, told by Anna Wicker and recorded byA. Wesley Jones in 1977. In the first sentence, the first participant, the mythical First Maker, isintroduced with an overt noun phrase which is not repeated again in the passage. In the secondsentence he sees two men, who are again introduced with an overt noun phrase. The two men arereferred to explicitly again in the third sentence when the focus shifts from the First Maker to themen.

       The First Maker was travelling along (they say). He was roaming around, traveling
       along the riverbank and scrutinizing the landscape; he was doing that, going around, and
       there were two men sitting there, catching fish at the river (they say). Standing here he
       watched them and he examined them and one could hear the men talking to each other,
       but they were not looking around (they say). (Jones 1978: 5)       If a transitive clause has two overtly expressed arguments outside the verb stem, theyneed to be disambiguated from each other. The need for disambiguation becomes even morepronounced in light of the relatively flexible word order that Hidatsa has. The unmarkedconstituent order in transitive clauses is AOV, but this may be scrambled for pragmatic reasons.","[399, 400, 401]"
"       Coordination of noun phrases is symmetric, i.e., the order of conjuncts can be changedwithout any effect on the interpretation of the meaning, as in (34) and (35).

"17.2 Relative clausesThere are two basic relativizers, agu- and aru-, that mark relative clauses and which function asall of, or part of, an element in the relative clause. Hidatsa relative clauses can be lexicallyheaded or occur without lexical heads.17.2.1 agu- ‘entitive relativizer’The entitive relativizer agu-, which occurs as oo- before the obstruent g, functions as arelativized element that is anaphorically linked to the head noun. In other words, the prefixfunctions as a relative pronoun that refers to an antecedent in the preceding clause. The relativeprefix marks the position of the subject, agent, or object, as in (1).",[539]
"        Hidatsa employs two systems of morpho-syntactic alignment that distinguish between thearguments of transitive and intransitive verbs. The two core arguments of transitive verbs, agentand object, and the single core argument of intransitive verbs, subject, are marked by (1)pronominal prefixes on verbs (split-intransitive alignment) and (2) suffixes on noun phrases(ergative alignment). Overtly expressed clausal arguments are also disambiguated by theirrelative ranking on the animacy and agentivity scales.                                                                                                   viii

"         B-set. This set of pronominals marks the subjects of stative verbs. In transitiveconstructions, B-set pronominals also mark the direct objects of transitive verbs (see 5.1).",[93]
"         C-set. The third set of prefixes marks the subjects of middle verbs, as well as objects ofpostpositions. Verbs inflected with C-set prefixes describe actions that are performed by thesubject for his or her own benefit or in which the subject affects itself.",[93]

5 Transitive verb inflectionHidatsa employs two systems of morphosyntactic alignment that distinguish between thearguments of transitive and intransitive verbs. The two core arguments of transitive verbs, agent(A) and object (O), and the single core argument of intransitive verbs, subject (S), are markedby (1) pronominal prefixes on verbs (split-intransitive alignment) and (2) suffixes on nounphrases (ergative alignment, see 9.5).","[231, 232]"
"
9.5 ErgativityThe ranking of grammatical relations between the matrix verb and and its syntactic arguments isrepresented through the syntactic encoding of participant roles. Whereas the Hidatsa verbalsystem follows the split-intransitive alignment (see 5.1), its nominal system follows the ergative-absolutive alignment, whereby the A-argument (agent) of a transitive verb can be marked withan ergative case, while the S-argument (subject) of an intransitive verb and the O-argument(object) of a transitive verb are left unmarked for the absolutive case. In other words, ergativealignment, which is marked by case marking on noun phrases, categorizes all intransitive S-arguments like transitive O-arguments of transitive verbs – both are left unmarked. The A-argument of transitive verbs is specified by the ergative case suffix -rí.",[395]
"           Intransitive verbs that mark the subject with B-set prefixes are called ‘stative verbs’. Mostof the stative verbs describe states and qualities, such as hisí to be red and xaráhxi be skinny, but
49
     The only exception to this generalization is the plural object prefix maa- (see 5.2) which never occurs in the role
of an intransitive subject.",[234]
"       Finally, the focus morpheme derives interrogative pronouns from D-words that are stativeverbs (see 12.1). D-words that are derived with -wa are used to ask questions about the non-ergative arguments S and O. The ergative case marker -rí is suffixed to the same stem instead of -wa if the question asked is about the ergative argument A. D-words with -wa may be used                                                                                                  370
instead of ergative D-words if the argument structure of the clause is disambiguated by othermeans, such as by marking the first or second person transitive object with the B-set pronominalprefixes on the stem (see 5.1). The derivation of absolutive (S or O) and ergative (A)interrogative pronouns is given in TABLE 9.1.","[393, 394]"
       One could argue that the examples in (106) and (107) have both a subject and an object.,[164]
"
82
     Whereas instrumental nouns with a specific referent are always syntactic phrases in which each component has its
own pitch pattern, there are a few irregularities to this pattern. For example, the instrumentalized verb stem in
máàˀiibaxisi snow plow forms a single phonological word with the object noun máà snow and is pronounced with the
low pitch to differentiate it from a minimally different indefinite lexeme maaˀiibáxisi shovel.",[358]
"6.1.3 CommandsCommands are used to elicit action from one or more addressees either by directing them orsuggesting that they engage in an activity. Prohibitive, or negative, commands direct theaddressee to refrain from an activity. In Hidatsa, there are two types of commands. The morecommon one is a prototypical imperative that has no other attitudinal connotations. The otherone, the precative, softens the tone of the command and makes it appear more like a politerequest or an entreaty rather than an order. Imperative and precative forms of active stems areinflected for number but not for person. Commands formed from middle and reflexive verbs areinflected for second person and number.",[266]

       A word begins with either a single phonemic consonant or the phonetic glottal stoppreceding vowel-initial syllables. There are no word-initial clusters except for a small number oflexemes that begin with a Ch cluster, as illustrated in (41). Other types of consonant clusters arelicensed only morpheme internally and at morpheme boundary.

       ghádaa          to stoke up the fire       Monosyllabic lexemes that do not begin with a cluster are always heavy: they contain along vowel or a diphthong, or a short vowel and the glottal stop, as in (42).
(42)   díà             long
       méé             lice
       éè              yes

Since content words consistingof a single light syllable are not grammatical in Hidatsa (unless the onset is a cluster), a phonetic[h] is added to the end of a monosyllable in order to keep it heavy, as the three examples in (45).","[52, 53]"

11 Independent personal pronounsHidatsa pronominals can be divided into bound pronominal prefixes that are obligatory andoptional free pronouns. 10211.1 Pronominal prefixesBound pronominals comprise three sets of prefixes that express the core arguments of the verb:(1) the A-set marks the subject of intransitive and transitive active verbs, (2) the B-set marks thesubject of stative verbs, predicative nouns and quantifiers, and direct objects, and (3) the C-setprefixes are used when an action is performed by the subject for his or her own benefit or inwhich the subject affects itself. The pronominal prefixes are treated in Chapter 3, and thecombinations of them in Chapter 5.","[428, 429]"
"       In 1876, a twenty-nine-year old Congregational missionary, Charles Lemon Hall,arrived at Fort Berthold where he remained until his death in 1940. In order to be moresuccessful in his activities, Hall resolved to learn all three native languages that were spoken onthe reservation. Without doubt he had most success with Hidatsa. Hall’s published materialsinclude a thirty-five-page pamphlet containing hymns and Bible passages (Hall 1906b), as wellas a six-page mythological narrative (Hall 1906a) with an interlinear translation. Hall’s mostsignificant unpublished materials include a manuscript Hidatsa phrasebook (Hall 1882) and an                                                                                                      9

"         As for the coordinative suffix -g, I have been unable to replicate Boyle’s observation thatit is not used as a same-subject marker in the modern language and that it now only occurs as averbal coordinator (Boyle 2007: 191). In fact, all my informants have judged Boyles example in(134) and other analogous constructions ungrammatical. In the corpus of thousands of tokenswith the coordinative suffix -g, all of which were recorded from contemporary speakers, I havebeen able to find only two systematic exceptions to the same-subject rule. First, the insertion ofthe evidential enclitic waree- between coordinate verb phrases overrides the same subjectrequirement, as illustrated by the different subjects ‘wind’ and ‘leaves’ in (135), and ‘secondperson’ and ‘telephone’ in (136). The combination of -g with waree- is unusual also for the factthat the long ee in the evidential enclitic does not undergo ablaut before the coordinative suffix(unlike nouns, verbs are always subject to ablaut before -g; see 17.3.1).",[571]
"                                                                                                                  125
       Finally, in clauses without an overt subject or object the role of the prefix maa- isambiguous. According to the specific pragmatic context it may be interpreted either as theindefinite marker, if one is speaking about things in general, or as the plural object marker, ifspecific multiple objects are referred to. More often than not, however, the reading is indefinite.","[148, 149]"
"        Intransitive verbs that mark the subject with A-set prefixes are called ‘intransitive activeverbs’. Also known simply as ‘intransitive verbs’, in Hidatsa, unlike in some other languages,they almost never denote qualities or states; instead, they describe activities and processes thatare not directed at an object. Typical intransitive active verbs include diríá to run, gháà to laugh,and miidí to crawl. The overwhelming majority of intransitive active verbs is characterized bycontrol over the activity by the participant, but a few, such as húá to cough, déè to die, andgibsúgi to belch, are not controlled.",[235]
"       The effects of noun stripping are illustrated in (290). As we saw in 2.4.2, morpheme-finalvowels are often deleted at a morpheme boundary in compounds. If the affected syllable has along vowel, then invariably both moras are deleted. However, in (290a) the final syllable in thejuxtaposed noun, ihúù mother, loses only the second, unaccented, mora. According to section2.4.3, the shortening of final long vowels is indicative of the right word boundary. This indicatesthat in (290) both ihúù and áˀciwi are separate phonological words. Although the sentence in(290a) appears to have AOV structure, the ergative case marker -rí in (290b) is not grammatical;therefore, maagarísda child cannot be the transitive Agent and, as a corollary, ihúù mothercannot be the transitive Object. Finally, since the definite article -s in (290c) cannot intervenebetween ihúù, which is in the “object” position, and the verb that follows, the only possibleanalysis is to treat ihúù and áˀciwi as a single grammatical word, which functions as anintransitive predicate that happens to comprise two phonological words.",[228]
"If a personal name is nevertheless used, it always occurs without the definite suffix -s and thefinal syllable is subject to the regular processes that mark the word as a vocative.",[484]
"                                                                                                                       548
            The second exception to the same-subject rule regarding -g concerns coordinated clausescontaining different subjects where the main verb is a direct causative with dative interpretation(see 4.7.2.4). In (137), for example, the subject of the first coordinated clause is third person(‘my button’), whereas the agent of the second clause is first person. It is also possible that thesame-subject marking with -g is possible when possessor in one clause is same as subject in theother – there is not enough data to make this determination at the present.","[571, 572]"
"Relativized active verbs subcategorize for a Subject or Object in the argument slot. Names of themonths in (64) and national holidays in (65), which have a temporal meaning, translate as ‘when                                                                                                 325
V happens to N’. Compounds with the locative meaning in (66) have the literal meaning ‘whereV happens to N’.","[348, 349]"
"Compounding is an underlyingly syntactic process in Hidatsa. The subcategorization frames arequite rigid even for derived nouns in Hidatsa. Just as it is not possible to omit a subcategorizedargument of a verb in Hidatsa, in compounds the argument slot for the subject of nominalizedstative and intransitive verbs, and the object or agent of transitive verbs has to be filled eitherwith a lexical noun or the indefinite prefix maa-. Inalienably possessed nouns subcategorize forthe possessor, and alienably possessed nouns have no arguments. The whole process in recursiveand a derived stem may serve as an argument in a more complex stem.",[330]

"       Hidatsa also allows what Miner (1986) termed Noun Stripping and Mithun (1984)Composition by Juxtaposition. In the case of noun stripping, the noun and the verb remainseparate words phonologically but the juxtaposed noun is stripped of the articles, demonstratives,and case markers. The demoted noun loses its status as a syntactic argument and the twojuxtaposed words function as a single intransitive predicate.",[228]

"       During the smallpox epidemics of the early 1780s, both the Mandan and the Hidatsaexperienced severe population loss. No more than 2,000 Hidatsas, or less than one half of thepre-epidemic population, survived the calamity. To make matters worse, a tribe of relativelyrecent newcomers, the Sioux, who were both numerous and aggressive, started to applyunbearable pressure on the sedentary village tribes. In order to increase their ability to withstandthe common enemy, the separate Hidatsa and Mandan villages consolidated their strength bysettling together. The Five Villages (Awadigihxú), as they came to be called, comprised threeHidatsa and two Mandan villages near the mouth of the Knife River at present-day Stanton,North Dakota.",[27]
