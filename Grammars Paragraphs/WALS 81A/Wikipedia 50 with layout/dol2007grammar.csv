"6.5 Nominal clauses
   Nominal clauses are clauses with a nominal head. In nominal clauses, the ‘subject’
usually refers to a known entity, while the nominal predicate gives additional information
about that entity. Semantically, nominal clauses can often be adequately translated as
equative clauses, that is clauses of the form ‘x is y’. Nominal clauses can be modified by
adverbials in the same way as verbal clauses. The structure of a verbless clause is:
(27)       {Time} Subj [NP] {Location/Manner/Aspect + Det}
   Some examples of nominal clauses appear below. In example (29) the subject contains
an RC, and in (30) the head of the clause is a possessive form.
(28)       ait guru
           3M teacher
           ‘He is a teacher.’
(29)       iso ro rae          kertia tiaran raya4
           road REL person work road main
           ‘The road that people are working on is the main road.’3
    The species referred to by ara wisam was not found by the botanists in Ayawasi (see Avé 1998).
4
    Kertia and tiaran were pronounced by an elderly man who has not received an education in Indonesian.
    The pronunciation of these words is adapted (see §2.8).
148         Chapter 6(30)         fane re-f-o                       fane ro Daniel Turot
             pig location.SPEC-very.near-U pig POSS Daniel Turot
             ‘This pig is Daniel Turot’s pig.’
    The following two examples illustrate nominal clauses modified by adverbials:
(31)         Tayie is5           ro    wia
             Tayie yesterday REL first
             ‘In the past, Tayie was the first one (to get hold of a valuable ceremonial cloth).’
(32)         um       s-au    arin        mti      oh
             moment one-3u situation evening already
             ‘Once upon a time, it was already dark.’
   Nominal clauses have the same intonational structure as verbal clauses, that is there is a
rise in pitch on the last word of the clause followed by a sharp drop in pitch on the last
syllable of that word, followed by a pause. This is illustrated in example (33). In (33) po
s-au fo constitutes a nominal clause, while y-awe n-ama ø-srot constitutes a verbal clause.
Both clauses are followed by a pause, and the pitch drops on the final syllable of the
utterance:
(33)         y-awe n-ama ø-sròt / po         s-au     f-ò   /
             3M-say 2-come ø-fast      thing one-3U very.near-U
             ‘He says: “Come quickly. Something is the matter.”’6.6 Topicalisation
   Although the SVO word order in Maybrat is very rigid, there is a notable variation
whereby the object is placed in clause-initial position. The function of this movement of
object is to switch the attention of the listener away from one ‘topic’, usually the subject of
the discourse, to another ‘topic’. Following Keenan (1985:243), I will refer to the fronting
of objects as ‘topicalisation’.6 The example below gives a contrast between a form where
the object follows the verb (34a) and one where it is fronted (34b). In (34b) the object am
re-f-o ‘this book’ is conceptually more prominent than am re-f-o in (34a). Example (34b) is
more marked than (34a), where the word order is regular.
(34) a.      t-kom    am   re-f-o                    m-kah t-atia
             1S-write book location.SPEC-very.near-U 3U-for 1S-father
             y-sia     t-me
             3M-with 1S-mother
             ‘I wrote this book for my father and mother.’
       b.    am   re-f-o                    t-kom    m-kah t-atia
             book location.SPEC-very.near-U 1S-write 3U-for 1S-father
5
    In this context, is refers to the past in general, and is therefore adequately translated as ‘in the past’.
6
    Functionally, topicalisations are similar to passives, since both can be regarded as ‘foregrounding
    constructions’ (Keenan 1985:243). Maybrat has no syntactic manifestation of the passive as it is known in
    Germanic languages, or, for instance, in Indonesian with the derivational prefix di- on a verb.
                                                                                        The clause      149           y-sia     t-me
           3M-with 1S-mother
           ‘This book, I wrote it for my father and mother.’
   Topicalised objects are separated from the rest of the clause by a pause, and they are
dominated by their own intonation contour. These intonational characteristics are typical of
what Givón refers to as ‘left-dislocation’, a device used to switch the attention of the reader
back to topics that were introduced earlier in the conversation (Givón 1990:757, 759).7 An
example follows:
(35)       fnia   aná / t-rof        Ø m-usiah t-kai
           woman 3P        1S-follow     3U-hunt 1S-find
           ‘The women, I followed (them), we went after them and I found them.’
(36)       aya    f-ó           / t-ata    fe
           water very.near-U / 1S-drink NEG
           ‘This water, I won’t drink it.’
    Below are some more examples of topicalised objects. The preceding context is given to
illustrate the pragmatic motivations to topicalise the object. In examples (37)–(38),
topicalised objects are underlined:
(37)       au m-sia   m-a        m-hu akah samu mos            m-iyo.
           3U 3U-with 3U-husband 3U-stay above {dancing house} big
           Mawah            Potafit m-se     Ø y-tien       ete    amah s-au kar
           adopted.child Potafit 3U-place        3M-sleep below house one-U alone
           ‘She with her husband, they lived above in a big dancing-house. The adopted
           child Potafit, they put (him) away, he slept below the house, alone.’
(38)       au ø-sokuos, y-me      f-o         ø-sokuos m-awe:
           3U ø-order   3M-mother very.near-U ø-order  3U-say
           n-amo n-apot ara          ø-hri aro. N-ama              re          po    aof
           2-go 2-cut tree           ø-bark other 2-come           in.order.to thing sago
           p-se     Ø re             p-tu
           1P-place      in.order.to 1P-stir
           ‘She ordered, his mother, she ordered saying: “you go and cut treebark
           and other things. Then come back, so that the sago thing, we place it so
           that we can stir it.”’8
7
    Givón makes a distinction between left-dislocation, whereby topics ‘that have been out of the focus of
    attention for a while ... are being brought back’ (Givón 1990:757), and Y-movement or contrastive
    topicalisation. Y-movement is used to contrast a referent with another referent of approximately the same
    semantic class (Givón 1990:754). An example of left-dislocation is ‘John, I never saw him there’; an
    example of Y-movement is ‘I saw John there. Mary I never saw.’ (the moved constituents are underlined).
    What I describe as ‘topicalisation’, in Maybrat corresponds pragmatically and syntactically to Givón’s
    left-dislocation.

    That is, they are going to make sago porridge, which is made by pouring hot water onto sago flour and
    then stirring until the porridge ‘sets’, i.e. becomes a gluey substance.
150        Chapter 66.7 Relativisation
   In §5.3 the formal properties of RCs were presented. In this section I will discuss
relativisation strategies in (single-verb) clauses, that is the formation of RCs by extracting
the subject NP or the object NP from a clause. The function of relativisation is to attract the
attention of the listener to an NP, and to give additional information about that NP.
Functionally, then, relativisation is similar to topicalisation, in that both are
‘foregrounding’ devices.
   There are two positions in the clause that can be relativised, namely the subject and the
object. Examples of NPs where the subject is relativised appear below. The position from
which the subject has been extracted is marked ‘Ø’. In the examples below, the a-forms
give the original clause, and the b-forms give the clause after relativisation.
(39) a.     ku    m-ait po-iit
            child 3U-eat thing-eat.P
            ‘The child eats food.’
      b.    ku    ro Ø m-ait po-iit                  ø-kiyam fares
            child REL        3U-eat thing-eat.P ø-ill        still
            ‘The child that eats food is still ill.’
(40) a.     kokok    m-ape           kokok m-auf
            chicken 3U-give.birth chicken 3U-content
            ‘The chicken is laying eggs.’9
      b.    kokok ro Ø m-ape                   kokok m-auf          m-mai mimo
            chicken REL        3U-give.birth chicken 3U-content 3U-sound very
            ‘The chicken that is laying eggs is making a lot of noise.’
    In examples (41) and (42) the object has been relativised:
(41) a.     t-he     rae
            1S-see person
            ‘I see someone/a man.’
      b.    rae    ro     t-he Ø y-ehoh kak
            person REL 1S-see           3M-stab cuscus
            ‘The man that I see stabs a cuscus.’
(42) a.     t-se      aya     akah meja
            1S-place water above table
            ‘I place water on the table.’
      b.    aya   ro t-se          Ø akah meja ø-kanam
            water REL 1S-place         above table ø-cold
            ‘The water that I place on the table is cold.’9
    Kokok m-auf is a possessive construction of the type possessor-possessed. M-auf ‘its content’ is an
    inalienably possessed noun. When it occurs in a construction where the possessor is a bird, m-auf refers to
    ‘egg’.
                                                                             The clause     1516.8 Adverbials
   The function of adverbials in the clause is to modify or specify an event expressed by
the predicate (see §4.7). Adverbials occur in the ‘periphery’ of the clause. In Maybrat
peripheral constituents can be syntactically defined as ‘any constituent which is not a head
or a subject or object argument’. Peripheral constituents are constituents that specify the
spatial or temporal setting of an event (cf. Foley & Olson 1985:36).
   In the discussion of the periphery, I will make a distinction between different types of
adverbials, based on syntactic and semantic criteria. The section will begin with the
periphery that precedes the predicate in a clause, that is the temporal periphery (§6.8.1).
Subsequently, the peripheries that occur in clause-final position are described, namely the
manner (§6.8.2), aspect (§6.8.3), and focus (§6.8.4) periphery. Apart from the adverbs
introduced in §4.7, these peripheries can also include items that formally belong to other
word classes, but can function as adverbials. In §6.8.6 I will discuss the location periphery.
Negation is described in §6.9. Clausal determiners and anaphoric reference are treated in
§6.10 and §6.11 respectively.","[165, 166, 167, 168, 169]"
"
4.11 Enumerator
    The class of enumerators comprises only one element, namely o ‘ENUM’. The element o
is used in enumerations, that is when listing items or events. The element o intonationally
occurs in constituent-final position, and a small pause separates o and the following NP.
The element o need not necessarily occur in the last NP in an enumeration. This is
illustrated in (358):69
(358)       t-ao          o       # t-ano          o       # ku        ø-kiniah m-ama
            1S-sibling.SS ENUM       1S-sibling.OS ENUM        child ø-small 3U-come
            ‘My siblings of the same sex, my siblings of the opposite sex, small children,
            they come.’
     The element o can also function as a coordinating conjunction between two clauses:
(359)       na       m-kuk      intape o         m-kuk ara o
            and.then 3U-pull rope       ENUM 3U-pull tree ENUM
            ‘Then he pulls a rope and he pulls a tree.’4.12 Interjections and particles
   There are a number of forms that are commonly used as interjections, that is forms that
do not enter into a syntactic relation of any kind (Crystal 1991:180). Intonationally,
interjections are followed by a pause. Some are given below, with their approximate
meanings:
(360)       ae         ‘yes’
            e          ‘hey’
            ehe        ‘no’
            ka         ‘eh?’
            pa         ‘eh’
            a          ‘mmm’
     Some examples are:
69
     In some dialects, when eliciting words from a list (for instance during surveys), o is added by informants
     after each reply given. In this context, the pitch drops sharply on the o, indicating that o is in utterance-
     final position.
126     Chapter 4(361)    ae / t-ama       oh
         yes    1S-come already
         ‘Yes! I’m already coming!’
(362)    pi   y-ko      y-no    p-awiya e?
         man 3M-roast 3M-do NOM-who hey
         ‘Hey, what does the man roast?’ (lit. ‘The man roasts, what does he do?’)
(363)    ehe / nuo ø-sre
         no    2S ø-wrong
         ‘No! You’re wrong.’
(364)    n-ros n-pet                 rae     n-o     po                ka
         2-stand 2-woman.marry.man person 2-take ceremonial.cloth eh
         ‘You mean get up and you marry a man, you receive ceremonial cloth or so?’
   The form ae can also function as a kind of focus adverbial (see §6.8.4). Pa is used when
a speaker hesitates:
(365)    rae    pa po-n-o              pa mati        s-au    m-e         u
         person eh? area.ADV-far-U eh? and.then one-3U 3u-return again
         ‘The men, the thing uh (she is confused), and then once, she returned.’
    The adverb peroh ‘wrong’ can also be analysed as an interjection, that is it does not
have a clear relation to the rest of the sentence, and it is surrounded by intonational pauses.
However, due to its semantic content, it is discussed in §4.7.5 on negators, and in §6.9.5
under the heading ‘other semantic negatives’.
    One particle, glossed ‘PART’, has been defined, namely the element -re in wo-re and
fi-re. Wo-re is a locative adverbial clause marker, while fi-re is a manner adverbial clause
marker. The function and meaning of -re are unclear. An example is:
(366)    m-hu wo-re                   rae ø-skie spiah
         3U-stay location.GEN-PART man ø-build hut
         ‘They stay where the people built a hut.’
   For a discussion on locative and manner adverbial clauses, see §9.2.2 and §9.2.3
respectively.
5              Noun phrases   In this chapter I will discuss noun phrases (NP), that is structures that are headed by a
noun (or a pronoun) and that may have one or more dependents (Matthews 1981:161–162).
NPs typically function as arguments in a clause.
   The basic structure of possible NPs in Maybrat is given in example (1). The portions
between braces can be subsumed under the heading ‘modifier’. The order of constituents in
the NP is rigid.
(1)    Types of noun phrase:
       a. ‘Regular’ noun phrase (NP):
          N + (Verbal Modifier + [(Classifier) + Numeral]/[Quantifying verb]
          + Determiner)
       b. Possessive NP:
          N + (Ninalienable + [(Classifier) + Numeral] + Determiner) /
          Nalienable + (ro + N + [(Classifier) + Numeral] + Determiner)
       c. Relative clause (RC):
          N + (ro + Clausal Modifier + Determiner)
   Thus, Maybrat is a ‘postmodifying’ language, since the modifiers follow the head noun.
This postnominal modifying order is in accordance with one of Greenberg’s universals,
namely that languages which have VO word order (Maybrat word order is SVO, see
Chapter 6) usually have noun-modifier order in NPs (Givón 1984:189, 199, 220, refers to
Greenberg 1966). The order of modifiers themselves in the NP conforms to another
universal, namely that if a language is post-modifying, the order of the modifiers is as
follows: descriptive adjective — numeral — demonstrative (Croft 1990:119, refers to
Greenberg 1966:87).
   Below, §5.1 concentrates on the structure of the NP as given in example (1a). As was
pointed out in §4.3.1–§4.3.2, two types of possessive construction can be identified, given
in (1b). Possessive NPs are discussed in §5.2. In §5.3, I will describe the form and function
of relative clause constructions (RCs), where a head noun is modified by an RC. The basic
structure of RCs is given in (1c). As is apparent from (1b) and (1c) above, there are two
types of nominal construction which have the element ro in common (also pointed out in
§4.10.1). I will focus on the similarities between possessive constructions and RCs in §5.4.","[143, 144, 145]"
"1.4 The linguistic scene
   According to Foley, on the island of New Guinea 1000 languages are spoken, 750 of
which have been classified as Papuan languages, the remainder being Austronesian (Foley
1986:8). Extensive pioneering work has been done by Wurm, Voorhoeve and Laycock6 to
establish genetic links between Papuan languages.7 The majority of Papuan languages can
be classified as Trans New Guinea phylum (TNGP) languages, a phylum which runs across
the entire island. In addition, some smaller phyla have been defined. Foley (1986) gives an
overview of the different genetic groupings of the languages of New Guinea, although he
is more reserved about the degree of interrelatedness than, for instance, Wurm (1981,
1982).
   Traditionally, three groups of Papuan languages were defined on the Bird’s Head: (1)
the languages belonging to the West Papuan Phylum; (2) the east Bird’s Head language
Hatam; and (3) the South Bird’s Head Stock, which typologically belongs to the TNGP
(see map Voorhoeve 1984). In addition to these, Austronesian languages are found on the5
    A woman’s ‘value’ depends, for instance, on her education, her social position in the village, whether she
    has a job, and how well she is expected to be capable of raising a family.
6
    Some publications include McElhanon and Voorhoeve (1970), Voorhoeve (1975), Wurm (1975) and
    Wurm et al. (1981, 1982).
7
    To establish the interrelatedness of languages, a standard word list of approximately 200 non-cultural
    items is used (a so-called Swadesh list). Two languages which share over 81% cognates are said to be
    dialects of the same language; languages sharing 29%–80% cognates are members of one and the same
    language Family; languages sharing 12%–28% cognates belong to different Families, but are related on a
    Stock level. Cognation percentages of 6%–11% place the languages in different Stocks, but in the same
    Phylum. Cognation percentages of less than 6% are not accepted as proof of genetic relationship (Wurm
    & McElhanon 1975:152).
                                                                                         Introduction      5Bird’s Head. The language described in the present study is a family-level isolate within
the West Papuan Phylum (WPP).8 This phylum also includes some North Halmahera
languages (Voorhoeve 1987a:717).9
   Some characteristics shared by all the WPP10 languages of the Bird’s Head are their
SVO word order, as opposed to the SOV order of those of the TNGP languages. All WPP
languages have prefixes that are coreferent with the subject (for verbs), or with the
possessor (of inalienably possessed nouns). In most languages there is a gender distinction,
and an opposition between inclusive and exclusive forms in the first person plural (Reesink
1996:2–3).11 There seem to be some similarities in the pronominal prefix systems across
WPP languages, suggesting a genetic relation (Cowan 1953:24–26; Reesink 1996:4). All
known languages display sequences of verbs under one clausal intonation contour (Reesink
1996:6), and the word order in NPs is generally: Noun-Adjective-(Classifier)-Numeral-
Determiner (Reesink 1996:8). Nominal compounds generally have the order ‘N1+ N2’,
where the whole noun is ‘a kind of N2’ (Reesink 1996:13).
   Recent research,12 however, has indicated that viewing the WPP as a group of
genetically related languages is difficult to maintain: in a comparative study Reesink has
hypothesised no less than seven unrelated language groups (Reesink 1996:18). A striking
feature of these languages is the low number of shared lexical items found between the
groups, contrasting with typological similarities. This has led to the hypothesis that
thousands of years ago, possibly even before the arrival of the Austronesians on the
peninsula,13 a number of unrelated languages were spoken in the Bird’s Head peninsula.
Through trade a kind of ‘Sprachbund’ emerged, in which morphosyntactic features were
shared, but vocabularies were not (Reesink 1996:x). So, instead of finding new evidence
for the interrelatedness of the languages of the WPP, recent research has only created an
even more confusing linguistic map of the Bird’s Head area.","[22, 23]"
"
6.1 Basic structure of the clause
  The basic structure of the clause in Maybrat is given in example (2). The order of
constituents, SVO, is rigid.
(2)        {Time} + (Subject) s-V (+Object) + {Location/Manner/Aspect + Det}
   A clause always consists of a head, the verb (V) taking an overt or covert person prefix.
Subjects and objects may be expressed as full NPs, but may also be omitted if they have
been mentioned earlier in the discourse. The omission of a subject or object does not
violate the acceptability of a clause. An object normally follows the verb, but it may also
be ‘topicalised’, that is fronted, to attract the attention of the listener. Temporal adverbials
precede the verb, and may precede the subject NP, in a clause, while location/manner/
aspect adverbials normally follow the verb and, if present, the object.
   A salient characteristic of clauses is their intonation pattern: on the last word of the
clause the pitch rises slightly, followed by a sharp drop. Following this sharp drop, there is
a pause.1

            3M 3M-go Kumurkek already tomorrow 3M-return again
            ‘He’s already gone to Kumurkek, tomorrow he will return again.’
  If another sentence follows, there may also be a rise in pitch, as illustrated below. The
same example illustrates that a fall in pitch at the end of a clause is not obligatory:
(4)         y-pat     Tenau Kosetiáh / y-ama         y-hu / Tenau Kohmaró             /
            3M-from Tenau Kosetiah        3M-come 3M-stay Tenau Kohmaro
            ‘He was from Tenau Kosetiah, he came to live at Tenau Kohmaro ...’
   Intonation may be indicative of a differing constituent structure, as indicated in example
(5). Example (5a) contains two clauses, because there is a fall in pitch on the last syllable
of m-anes, followed by a pause. In this example, ku m-anes functions as a clause.
Conversely, (5b) contains just one clause: the only intonation break and sharp drop in pitch
are found utterance- (=clause) finally. Here, ku m-anes functions as a subject.
(5) a.      ku     m-anès / m-amo sekolàh /
            child 3U-old        3U-go school
            ‘The child is old (enough), she’s going to school.’
      b.    ku     m-anes m-amo sekolàh /
            child 3U-old 3U-go school
            ‘The old child is going to school.’

    Other intonational patterns are presented in §2.7 on intonation.
144    Chapter 66.2 The head
   The head of a clause can be an intransitive verb (see §4.2.2) or a transitive verb (§4.2.3).
In sentences (6)–(8) examples of the ‘minimal’ clauses are given, that is clauses consisting
only of a verb and its obligatory person prefix. In these examples, arguments other than
person prefixes are not expressed.
(6)      t-api
         1S-big
         ‘I am big.’
(7)      y-fos
         3M-wind
         ‘He is cold.’
(8)      n-kom
         2-write
         ‘Write!’
  Some examples of clauses with intransitive verbs in which the subject is expressed as an
NP appear below:
(9)      pi   Hermanus y-anes oh
         man Hermanus 3M-old already
         ‘The man Hermanus is already old.’
(10)     ara m-ake        re-t-o            m-kek
         tree 3U-fruit location.SPEC-near-U 3U-red
         ‘The fruit (of the tree) is red.’
   In sentences (11)–(14) examples of clauses involving transitive verbs are given. As
argued in §4.2.3, six different types of transitive verb can be identified in Maybrat, namely
‘regular transitive verbs’, that is verbs which take a nominal object (§4.2.3.1); ‘motion
verbs’ and ‘position verbs’ (§4.2.3.2); ‘shared argument construction verbs’ (§4.2.3.3);
‘complement-taking verbs’ (§4.2.3.4); prepositional verbs (§4.2.3.5), and a comitative verb
(§4.2.3.6). With the exception of the prepositional verbs and the comitative verb, all the
verbs in these classes can function as the head of a clause. The discussion in this chapter
will be centred around clauses that include these transitive verbs; prepositional verbs and
the comitative verb are treated in Chapter 8.
   Below, examples of clauses involving transitive verbs are given.
(11)     rae     m-fat ara
         person 3U-fell tree
         ‘The people fell a tree.’
(12)     t-e       am
         1S-give mat
         ‘I give a mat.’
(13)     ku    ø-kiniah re-t-o                  m-asah pi y-api
         child ø-small location.SPEC-near-U 3U-laugh man 3M-big
         ‘These small children laugh at the old man.’
                                                                                        The clause       145(14)        m-fau yu m-api re-t-o
            3U-fill bag 3U-big location.SPEC-near-U
            ‘She fills that big bag.’6.3 The subject
   In addition to a subject, expressed by an overt or covert person prefix, that is always
present in a clause because it is included in the verbal form, a subject may be expressed in
the form of an NP. The motivation for expressing such a subject is pragmatic: if the subject
cannot be unambiguously identified from the preceding discourse, then it is expressed. The
absence of an overt subject NP never renders a clause ungrammatical.
   Examples where the subject NP is omitted are given in sentences (16) and (17).
Examples (15)–(17) form the beginning of a story (‘Ø’ marks the position where an overt
subject NP is absent):
(15)        pi   s-ait    y-asom Srah Watà                 /
            man one-3M 3M-name Srah Wata
            ‘One man, his name is Srah Wata.’
(16)        Ø   y-hu      m-ae Mosun Mapàt                 /
                3M-live 3U-at Mosun Mapat
            ‘He lives at Mosun Mapat.’
(17)        um       s-au     Ø y-amo y-hoh             po    r-aìt     /
            moment one-3U          3M-go 3M-chase thing POSS-3M
            ‘One time, he went to chase (after) his ceremonial cloth.’2
   In example (15), which is an instance of a verbless clause (see §6.5) the topic of the
discourse, pi s-ait ‘one man’ is introduced. In the following sentence, pi s-ait is not
explicitly mentioned, as it is clear from both the discourse and the third person masculine
person prefix on the verb -hu that pi s-ait is still the subject. The same applies to (17). In
both sentences the subject is ‘notionally’ present.
   The relation between the overt subject NP and the clause itself, in which the subject NP
specifies information which is already present in the person prefix on the verb, but has no
syntactic function, is described as an appositional relation, following Dik (1987:134–135).
The appositional character of subject NPs in Maybrat can be syntactically motivated:
temporal adverbials (see §6.8.1) can either precede or follow the subject NP without
creating any difference in meaning:
(18) a.     is        ana m-kai       mes
            yesterday 3P 3U-meet fern.vegetable
            ‘Yesterday they found fern vegetables.’
       b.   ana is           m-kai mes
            3P yesterday 3U-find fern.vegetable
            ‘Yesterday they found fern vegetables.’
2
    In the system of exchanging ceremonial cloth, people often lend their cloths to other parties, who may use
    them in trade again. At some point, such cloths, or cloths equivalent in value to the ones originally lent
    out, are claimed back by the owners. In the story, Srah Wata sets out to reclaim his ceremonial cloths.
146         Chapter 6(19) a.      rere     tuo t-amo amah
             shortly 1S 1S-go house
             ‘Shortly I will go home.’
       b.    tuo rere      t-amo amah
             1S shortly 1S-go house
             ‘Shortly I will go home.’
   The ‘risk’ in omitting subject NPs is that the clause becomes unintelligible because the
referent of the subject is unknown. This is especially the case for clauses including a verb
with a covert person prefix.","[161, 162, 163, 164]"
"1.5 Previous research in Maybrat
   Before 1993, some research had been done in the Maybrat area. The first linguistic
notes were made by J.-E. Elmberg, who worked in the Ayamaru area between 1953 and
1957. The Popot feast cycle (1966) includes sixteen pages of transcriptions of texts in the
dialect of Ayamaru (below referred to as Maymaru). These transcriptions give an idea of
the language, but the English translations are free, that is there are no interlinear glosses,
and there is no morphological breakdown. No orthographic conventions are given, so only
very superficial phonetic information can be gathered from these texts. The work also8
   A family-level isolate is a language which, on its own, comprises one Family of a Stock (Wurm &
   McElhanon 1975:152).
9
   Foley (1986) does not discuss the WPP at all, as hardly any information on this Phylum was available.
10
   However, most WPP languages on Halmahera do have SOV word order (Voorhoeve 1988:192–193; van
   Staden pers. comm.).
11
   Both the SVO word order and the inclusive/exclusive distinction are typically Austronesian
   characteristics. With respect to the opposition between inclusive and exclusive which is not grammatically
   expressed, Maybrat is an exception in the Bird’s Head. The absence of this opposition was also pointed
   out by Cowan (1953:21). For more information on first person plural forms in Maybrat (see §4.1.1).
12
   Within ISIR, work has been done on the languages Moi (Menick 1995, 1996); Hatam (Reesink 1999);
   Inanwatan (de Vries 1996); Mpùr (Odé 1995:1996).
13
   According to radiocarbon dating of archaeological remains, the Austronesian population started to
   disperse into Western Oceania around 3300 BP (Bellwood et al. 1998:233).
6    Chapter 1includes a short word list. Elmberg’s PhD dissertation, ‘Balance and circulation: aspects of
tradition and change among the Mejprat of Irian Barat’ (1968), includes a transcription of a
myth in Maybrat. There is an extensive Maybrat-English word list which includes over
1500 lexical items. Again, no morphological information is given, but a short introduction
to the orthography gives an idea about how the language is pronounced.
    The first published information about the people in Ayawasi appears in an ethnography
by H. Schoorl, ‘Mensen van de Ayfat: Ceremoniële ruil en sociale orde in Irian Jaya-
Indonesia’ (1979).14 In the description, many Maybrat terms are included. These terms
only represent a small part of the language material Schoorl collected in Ayawasi:
extensive word lists and recordings of myths, some of which had been transcribed, were
kindly given to me when I started working on the Maybrat language.
    More recently, two linguistic articles based on fieldwork in Ayamaru were published by
W.U. Brown, namely ‘Mai Brat nominal phrases’ (1990) and ‘A quantitative phonology of
Mai Brat’ (1991).
    A word list including approximately 2500 lexical items in Maybrat/Indonesian/English
was published by UNCEN-SIL.15 These words are arranged according to semantic
category, and in alphabetical order. Some other works have also been published by
UNCEN-SIL: one of these is a book which includes five stories about the origins of rivers
and lakes.16 These works are also based on the Ayamaru dialect.
    Recently, research has been conducted in the Bird’s Head within the framework of the
programme ‘Irian Jaya Studies: a programme for interdisciplinary research’ (ISIR).171.6 The language
   The name Maybrat (see next paragraph for this orthography)18 is morphologically a
compound noun (for an analysis of compound nouns, see §4.3.5), consisting of two
members. The first is mai, a noun meaning ‘sound’. This form can also function as a verb
stem, as in, for instance n-mai ‘You make a sound’; p-mai ‘We make a sound’. The second
part, brat, seems to refer to the type of sound, in other words, the particular language
variety. However, the isolated form brat is unattested. The people who speak Maybrat refer
to themselves as rae ro Maybrat <man REL {sound brat}> ‘the people who speak
Maybrat’. These people are subdivided into groups according to the area where they14
   ‘People of the Ayfat, ceremonial exchange and social organisation in Irian Jaya-Indonesia’.

17
   Research by the present author has resulted in a number of publications on the Maybrat language, namely
   Dol (1995; 1996; 1998; 2000). Other collections of work on the Bird’s Head include Bartstra, ed. (1998)
   on geology, Miedema et. al. (1998) reporting on the results of an interdisciplinary conference on the
   Bird’s Head, and Reesink (forthcoming) on languages of eastern Bird’s Head.
18
   In §2.1.2 I point out that if [j] and [w] occur phonetically in this position, they are allophones of /i/ and /u/
   respectively, and not of /y/ and /w/. Since the orthography I use is based on the phonemic structure of a
   form (see §3.6), one would expect the form Maibrat. However, in spelling the name of this language as
   Maybrat, I follow the orthography that the Maybrat themselves use. The forms [maj0brYt] and [maj0prYt]
   vary freely, although the former is more common, hence the orthography.
                                                                                          Introduction      7originate, for instance, the people in Ayawasi are referred to as rae Hapeh, those of the
East Ayfat as rae Asmaun, those of Fef as rae Karon, those of Suswa as rae Mare.19 In
Ayawasi it was agreed that these people all qualified as rae ro Maybrat, since everyone
spoke the same language, although the dialects differed.
   Maybrat is spoken in the kecamatans Ayfat, Ayamaru, Aytinyo, Kebar and Sausapor, of
which kecamatan Ayfat is most centrally located. The area where Maybrat is spoken
covers approximately 2570 km2 (Schoorl 1979:11).
   With the establishment of schools in the area, the Indonesian language has also become
widely used. In Ayawasi, where a primary school was established in the early 1950s, many
people under 50 years of age, as well as all younger people, are bilingual in Maybrat and
Indonesian. Older people often speak Indonesian20 to some extent, but prefer to speak
Maybrat. Some older people speak no Indonesian at all. Indonesian is the standard
language in the schools, in contacts with the mission and in the Church.21 At the hospital,
Maybrat is often used by the local nurses when dealing with the elderly. In daily life, both
Maybrat and Indonesian are used, although I noted a preference for Maybrat. Children
learn the two languages simultaneously. Maybrat speakers often pepper their Maybrat with
Indonesian words (but rarely the other way around), or they switch back and forth between
Maybrat and Indonesian.22 Older members of Maybrat families who live in the cities,
usually people who grew up in a village in the interior, may use Maybrat. Their children,
however, only have a limited passive knowledge of the language.
   Maybrat has a number of linguistically interesting characteristics. Morphologically,
there are two classes of nouns: those that are obligatorily prefixed for possession, namely
kinship terms and terms for body parts, and those that are not prefixed. The nouns that are
obligatorily prefixed receive person prefixes in exactly the same way as verbs.
   Maybrat has an elaborate system of complex demonstratives comprising three bases
which express distance from the point of view of the speaker. Suffixes are taken according
to gender, and the choice of prefix depends on the syntactic function, its meaning, and
specificity. For instance, there are distinct prefixes to refer to specific areas as opposed to
large areas. A number of demonstratives also have derived functions, such as temporal
adverbials and anaphoric referents, while others can function as markers for locative and
temporal adverbial clauses. In the formation of interrogative forms, some of the
demonstrative prefixes are used.
   The number system is based on body parts: the numbers from ‘one’ to ‘four’ are unique
terms, and these are combined with terms for hand/finger and foot/toe to form the numbers
up to ‘nineteen’.","[23, 24, 25]"

    This grammar could never have been completed without the help of many organisations
and people. To begin with, I thank NWO: research for this dissertation was conducted
within the framework of the NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research)
priority programme ‘The Irian Jaya Studies: a programme for interdisciplinary research’
(ISIR), financed by WOTRO (Netherlands Organization for the Advancement of Tropical
Research). Secondly, I would like to thank Dr Hasan Alwi, head of the ‘Pusat Pembinaan
dan Pengembangan Bahasa’, for acting as my sponsor, enabling me to carry out fieldwork
in Indonesia, and the ‘Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia’ (LIPI), under whose auspices
the research was carried out. I am indebted to Han Schoorl for kindly giving me all the
language material that he collected while he was in Ayawasi in the early seventies for his
anthropological research, as well as background information about people in the village
before I went there. The Roman Catholic Missionaries in Sorong, particularly the
Augustinian Fathers P. Tuyp, T. Tromp and F. Jonkergouw, were always hospitable, and
helped to solve many logistic problems. Likewise, my thanks are due to Father B.
Ngamelubun and Father J. Fatem in Ayawasi, as well as to the Sisters of the ‘Ordo Sancto
Franciscus’ (OSF), who initially put me up in Ayawasi, and were always there when I
needed them.
    I am greatly indebted to all the people in Ayawasi and other villages for helping me to
gather data. I would especially like to thank Didimus Bame and Yan Piter Tenau, who
assisted me with many transcriptions of the recorded material, and Petrus Turot, my main
informant, for his time, his understanding, his lucid explanations and, most of all, his
patience. I thank Elisabeth (Lys) Korain, Maria Fanataf, and Yuliana Yumte for their
friendship, and the latter especially for refusing to speak Indonesian to me. I hope that this
description will do some justice to the Maybrat language, and will reflect the enthusiasm
with which everyone in the village taught me. I am also grateful to Marcel Polak and his
family and to Colin Ridsdale for their collegiality and comraderie while we were doing
fieldwork. I am particularly grateful to Wanda Avé, the ethnobotanist, for all the work we
did, and still do, together and for her warm friendship.
    An earlier version of this work was submitted as a doctoral dissertation at the University
of Leiden, and was defended on September 15, 1999. I am very grateful to my supervisor
Ger Reesink, who supported me throughout the various stages of this work. His critical and
detailed comments have been invaluable, and it was he who taught me how to approach
descriptive linguistics. My promoter, Wim Stokhof, continuously cheered me on and
provided many useful comments in the final stages of this research. I would like to express
especially warm thanks to Bert Voorhoeve, our ‘veteran’ Papuanist and descriptive

phonetic analysis of my data both in the field and in the Netherlands: I am grateful for that,
and for our friendship that resulted from travelling and working together. In the final stages
of this work Professor C.L. Ebeling provided many detailed comments which have saved
me from some considerable phonological and other linguistic blunders. I thank Lourens de
Vries for evaluating the entire manuscript and suggesting some improvements in the form
of an index and word-lists. Finally, I thank Professor T.C. Schadeberg, Colin Ewen, Gunter
Senft, Hein Steinhauer and Aone van Engelenhoven for reading the manuscript before I
defended it and providing another set of useful comments. Prior to publication of this
manuscript, an anonymous reviewer of Pacific Linguistics commented on the entire
version, which led to a number of notable improvements for which I am very grateful.
   I would like to thank my colleagues at the Projects Division for their practical and moral
support throughout this project. Mary Bakker supported me with many logistic matters, not
only when I was in the field, but also at home in Leiden. I thank Raymond Menick for the
discussions we had in ‘The Lambada’ in Sorong, on linguistics in particular and The Bird’s
Head in general. Ron Habiboe made the maps, and gave many tips on how to tame the
computer. Miriam van Staden and Aglaia Cornelisse meticulously ploughed through the
manuscript, and provided me with helpful comments. Elja Dekker was always (and I mean
always) ready to answer stylistic questions, and confidently predicted the ultimate
completion of this project from the beginning onwards. I thank Ruurd for turning round the
Maybrat–English wordlist, and for being my wonderful partner and father to our daughters
Eline and Charlotte and to our son Adriaan. Last, but not least, I thank my parents, to
whom I have dedicated this work, for always letting me go my own way, while at the same
time always giving me their unconditional love and support.
   Naturally, any mistakes that remain are my responsibility entirely.

1            Introduction   Maybrat is a Papuan language which is spoken in the central area of the Bird’s Head
Peninsula, Papua Province, Indonesia. The total number of speakers is approximately
22,000 (Brown 1991:1). Despite the fact that it is one of the larger local languages in
Papua Province in terms of numbers of speakers, a comprehensive grammar on this
language has hitherto not been published. The objective of the present study is to provide a
detailed linguistic description of the phonology, morphology, syntax and features of
discourse of Maybrat. The data for this study were collected over a period of two years in
Ayawasi, a village in central Bird’s Head.
   In this chapter some background information on the language and its speakers is given,
namely a description of the geography, demography, and administration (§1.1), the history
(§1.2), the people (§1.3), the linguistic scene (§1.4), previous studies (§1.5), the language
(§1.6) and the dialects (§1.7). The final section of this introductory chapter gives an
account of the fieldwork.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"8.5 Comitatives
   The comitative verb -sia was introduced in §4.2.3.6. There, I stated that -sia takes both
a subject and an object, and that it cannot function as a main verb. In this section, I will
discuss the syntactic behaviour of comitative constructions.
   Formally, -sia is a verb which takes two arguments. The person prefix of -sia must be
coreferent with the subject of the verb. The forms below are NPs: they cannot function as
predicates.
(107)    tuo t-sia    fnia
         1S 1S-with woman
         ‘I with the woman’
(108)    ait y-sia       y-ano
         3M 3M-with 3M-sibling.OS
         ‘he with his sister’
210      Chapter 8   In example (109a) tuo t-sia ait functions as the subject of a clause. The main verb -amo
‘go’ takes a first person singular person prefix t-. Conversely, in (109b), the main verb
takes a plural person prefix p- whilst in (110), there is also subject agreement. In this
example, the comitative is considered part of the subject, hence the plural case marking.
This type of comitative is more common in Papuan languages (see Reesink 1987:85).
(109) a.     tuo t-sia   ait t-amo Kumurkek
             1S 1S-with 3M 1S-go Kumurkek
             ‘I accompanied by him, I go to Kumurkek.’
        b.   tuo t-sia   ait p-mo Kumurkek
             1S 1S-with 3M 1P-go.P Kumurkek
             ‘I accompanied by him, we go to Kumurkek.’
(110)        t-atia    y-sia   t-me       m-ama     Ayawasi
             1S-father 3M-with 1S-mother 3U-come Ayawasi
             ‘My father and my mother come to Ayawasi.’
   The semantic difference between examples (109a) and (109b) is as follows: in (109a)
the singular person prefix on the main verb emphasised the fact that tuo ‘I’ is going, is
more important than the fact that someone is accompanying ‘tuo’. Conversely, in (109b),
the emphasis is on the fact that two people are going, marked by the plural person prefix.
   In example (111a), the scope of r-ait ‘his’ is the entire comitative construction amah
m-sia onfuk, that is this comitative construction functions as the head of the NP amah
m-sia onfuk r-ait. In (111b), the scope of r-ait is onfuk. Here, a pause marks the constituent
boundary between the object NP amah, and the following comitative form m-sia onfuk
r-ait.
(111) a.     ø-hpi     amah m-sia       onfuk r-aìt    /
             ø-destroy house 3U-with clothes POSS-3M
             ‘He destroyed his house and his clothes.’
        b.   ø-hpi     amáh / m-sia           onfuk r-aìt  /
             ø-destroy house       3U-with clothes POSS-3M
             ‘He destroyed his house and his clothes.’
   Apart from the fact that comitative constructions function as an NP in a clause,
and cannot function as a predicate, there are a number of other differences between
comitative constructions and verbal predications. First, as is the case for prepositional
verbs, comitative constructions are unattested without an object. Secondly, the object in a
comitative construction cannot be extracted.
   In addition to these functional differences, comitatives are also formally different
because they may lack a person prefix. Illustrations are given in examples (112) and (113).
There seems to be no semantic difference between forms with and without person prefix in
this type of constituent. Apart from a few adverbial verbs (described in §8.2), instances of
verbal forms lacking an overt or a covert person prefix are unattested in the data.
(112) a.     t-hu      sia anu
             1S-stay with 2P
             ‘I’ll stay with you.’
                                                                       Sequences of verbs      211        b.    t-hu       t-sia   anu
              1S-stay 1S-with 2P
              ‘I’ll stay with you.’
(113)         ayu sia snie ø-frok
              sun with moon ø-emerge
              ‘The sun and the moon emerge.’
   The omission of a subject-prefix results in a ‘decategorialised’ form, that is a form in
which aspects typical of that category, such as the presence of a person prefix for verbs, are
absent (cf. Hopper 1991:22). This feature, or rather the lack of this feature, may be
indicative of a grammaticalisation process in which the comitative verb is changing into a
preposition. Other motivations for a change in categorial status are the differing syntactic
properties of -sia compared to those of ‘true’ verbs. Shifts in the grammatical status of a
lexical item to assume a more grammatical function (here that of a coordinator) are often
accompanied by restricted morphological and syntactic properties (Heine et al. 1991:2,
they refer to Hopper and Thompson 1984).
   The verb -sia also occurs in clause-final position. Its meaning here is not fully
understood. In examples (114) and (115) below, the verb -sia refers to the fact that a dog
accompanies the subject. Syntactically, the objects of the verbs, that is mtah sumaya r-ana
s-au in (114) and mtah in (115) are topicalised (see §6.6 on topicalisation). In these
examples, -sia semantically implies ‘be accompanied for hunting’. In (115b) mtah occurs
in clause-final position, but here the meaning of ‘accompany for hunting’ is absent.
(114)         mtah su-m-aya15        r-ana    s-au    eok m-sia
              dog eye-3U-water POSS-3P one-3U two 3U-with
              ‘One of their “street dogs” accompanies the two for hunting.’
(115) a.      mtah y-ao                    Frans y-sia
              dog 3M-sibling.same.sex Frans 3M-with
              ‘A dog accompanies his sibling (same sex) Frans for hunting.’
        b.    y-ao            Frans y-sia     mtah
              3M-sibling.SS Frans 3M-with dog
              ‘His sibling (same sex) Frans with his dog.’
   In example (116) the verb -sia occurs three times, each time in clause-final position, but
the object au ‘she’ is not expressed. This is unlike (114) and (115), where the object is
always expressed, albeit as a topicalised form. The example in (116) is taken from a text
recorded 25 years ago.16 Possibly the verb -sia had more verbal properties then than it has
now, which would account for its ‘verbal’ behaviour in (116).
(116)        ø-tupat fane poh r-au       m-sia Ø tipuo,
             ø-lift  {pig white} POSS-3U 3U-with immediately
             ø-tupat mtah r-au   m-sia Ø             tipuo
             ø-lift  dog POSS-3U 3U-with             immediately15
     Sumaya derives from m-asu m-aya <3U-eye 3U-water> ‘Its eyes are watery.’
16
     The text from which this example was taken was recorded somewhere during the period 1972–74 in
     Ayawasi by the anthropologist J.M. Schoorl.
212     Chapter 8         ø-tupat ru kos       r-au       m-sia Ø tipuo
         ø-lift  {k.o. bird} POSS-3U 3U-with           immediately
         ‘She immediately lifts up the white pig and (takes) it with her, she lifts her
         dog and takes it with her, and she lifts her yearbird and takes it with her.’8.6 Relativisation revisited
   In this chapter, relativisation was used as a test for constituency. A number of forms,
notably objects of prepositional verbs, were difficult or impossible to relativise. These facts
about relativisation in Maybrat correspond to the generalisation introduced by Keenan and
Comrie (1977:66), stated in the Accessibility Hierarchy, given below:
        Subject > Direct Object > Indirect Object > Object of Preposition > Possessor
                                                         (from Keenan (1985:147))
   One of the generalisations that applies to this hierarchy is that if a language can
relativise a position which is low on the hierarchy, then all the positions higher on this
hierarchy can also be relativised (Keenan & Comrie 1977:68). Thus, if a language can
relativise direct objects, then it can also relativise subjects. A language may have a strategy
to make relativisation possible, such as lexical reorganisation, in order to attain this goal
(Keenan & Comrie 1977:71).
   To begin on the left-hand side of the Accessibility Hierarchy, in single verb clauses in
Maybrat, relativisation of subjects and objects is always possible, as illustrated in §6.7. The
objects of prepositional notions expressed with verbs -pat ‘from’ and -kit ‘towards’, that is
the prepositional verbs that morphologically behave most like verbs, can be relativised on,
as long as the prepositional verb is preceded by another verb, as in (119). In other words,
these objects behave like ‘normal’ objects.
(117)    aof ro rae         m-siar    m-amo m-kit           m-hu rapuoh
         sago REL person 3U-many 3U-go 3U-towards 3U-stay forest
         ‘The sago(tree) that many people go towards is in the forest.’
(118)    Sorong ro t-ama        t-pat     m-hu m-ae sasu
         Sorong REL 1S-come 1S-from 3U-stay 3U-at coast
         ‘Sorong where I come from is on the coast.’
(119)    ?rapuoh ro y-pat          y-ama     m-hu e
          forest   REL 3M-from 3M-come 3U-stay far
         ‘The forest from where he comes is far (away).’
   The object of the prepositional ‘verb’ m-kah can be relativised on, but the order of the
verbs has to be reversed in the RC. In other words, Maybrat has a strategy to make
relativisation on the object of this verb possible.
(120)    ku    ro m-kah t-kom         am        ø-kiyam m-ase
         child REL 3U-to 1S-write letter ø-ill              3U-very
         ‘The child for whom I write a letter is very ill.’
   Objects of the ‘defective paradigm’ prepositional verb -ae ‘at’ cannot be relativised,
as in (121). In terms of the hierarchy, Maybrat treats the objects of these verbs as
prepositional objects.
                                                                   Sequences of verbs     213(121)         *amah ro t-amo m-ae Ø          m-hu Ayawasi
               house REL 1S-go 3U-at         3U-stay Ayawasi
   The hierarchy predicts that possessors cannot be extracted at all. This is indeed the case,
as illustrated in example (122b), derived from the single-verb clause in (122a), where
‘Petrus’ is the possessor:
(122) a.      ku    ø-kiniah m-ai        mtah ro-Petrus
              child ø-small 3U-hit dog POSS-Petrus
              ‘The small child hits Petrus’ dog.’
        b.    *Petrus ro ku    ø-kiniah m-ai mtah y-atak
              Petrus REL child ø-small 3U-hit dog 3M-angry8.7 Some problems
   The constructions described so far could all be described consistently with the help of
intonational, morphological and syntactic criteria. Those that seemed exceptions, like the
prepositional verbs and comitative constructions, were accounted for by placing them in
the framework of well-attested grammaticalisation processes.
   However, constructions involving the motion verbs and position verbs introduced in
§4.2.3.2, as well as the ‘shared argument construction’ verbs introduced in §4.2.2.3 have
not been discussed yet. These verbs are repeated below:
(123)        motion verbs:
             -amo      ‘go’
             -ama      ‘come’
             position verbs:
             -ros       ‘stand’
             -hu        ‘stay’
             hren       ‘sit’
             shared argument construction verbs:
             -o         ‘take’
             -po        ‘hold’
             -ehoh      ‘stab’
   Sequences involving these verbs are highly similar to the coordinating constructions
described in §8.1. To begin with, they may be dominated by either a single intonation
contour (a-forms below), or by an intonation contour over each verb plus its arguments,
with a pause between the verbs (b-forms), without effecting a marked semantic difference:
(124) a.      m-amo m-ate            ayà /
              3U-go 3U-go.under water
              ‘She goes and bathes.’
        b.    m-amò / m-ate           ayà   /
              3U-go       3U-go.under water
              ‘She goes, and bathes.’
214    Chapter 8(125) a.   y-ros     lapangan ø-kream po-safòm /
           3M-stand field           ø-cut      NOM-green
           ‘He stands in the field and he cut grass.’
      b.   y-ros     lapangàn / ø-kream po-safòm                 /

           ‘He stands in the field, and he cuts grass.’
(126) a.   y-po      pam y-fat      arà      /
           3M-hold axe 3M-fell tree
           ‘He holds the axe and fells the tree.’
      b.   y-po     pàm / y-fat         arà      /
           3M-hold axe        3M-fell tree
           ‘He holds the axe and fells the tree.’
(127) a.   t-ai    bola m-amò /
           1S-hit ball 3U-go
           ‘I throw the ball away.’ (lit. ‘I throw the ball and it goes.’)
      b.   t-ai    bolà / m-amò         /
           1S-hit ball       3U-go
           ‘I throw the ball away.’
   Secondly, all the verbs in sequences involving the verbs in example (123) take an
obligatory person prefix (whether overt or covert), as is evident from the examples given in
(124)–(127) above.
   Thirdly, it is always possible to insert the coordinator mati between the verbs without
significantly changing the meaning of the utterance:
(128) a. y-hu     sekolah ø-farkor
         3M-stay school ø-study

                                                                   Sequences of verbs     215   Fourthly, if utterances containing any of the verbs in example (123) are changed into
polar questions, the utterance becomes ambiguous, because the scope can be over either
the entire proposition, or over just the last ‘conjunct’:
(131)    ø-hren t-kom       am      a
         ø-sit     1S-write letter INT
         1. ‘Should I sit (down) and write a letter?’
         2. ‘I sit down, but should I write a letter?’
(132)   y-ros      y-o      y-ati               ara a
        3M-stand 3M-take 3M-put.in.ground tree INT
        1. ‘Does he stand and take and put the sticks into the ground?’
        2. ‘He stands and takes (the sticks), but should he put them into
            the ground (or should he do something else with them)?’
(133)    n-o      tapak     n-e    ait a
         2-take tobacco 2-give 3M INT
         1. ‘Will you take the tobacco and give it to him?’
         2. ‘You take the tobacco, but will you give it to him,
            or will you do something else with it?’
   Like the coordinating sequences, these constructions can be disambiguated by inserting
a pause between the two verbs: example (134) only allows one interpretation.
(134)    y-ehoh fanè / m-hai             à    /
         3U-stab pig         3U-dead INT
         ‘He stabs the pig, but does it die?’
   A problem is presented by the examples containing a motion verb as the second verb in
the sequence: here the scope of the interrogator is necessarily over both verbs. So, example
(135) cannot be interpreted as *‘I pour the water, but does it ‘go’ (rather than ‘come’, or
‘fall’) into the thermos flask?’. Likewise, (136) cannot mean *‘He sends a letter, but does it
‘come’ (rather than ‘arrive at’, or ‘go to’) to Ayawasi?’ In other words, these sequences
behave similarly to the sequences involving an object-complement as discussed in §8.3:
placing these in the interrogative mood also resulted in an unambiguous reading.
(135)    t-tu      aya   m-amo cerek              a
         1S-pour water 3U-go thermos.flask INT
         ‘Should I pour water into the thermos flask?’
(136)    ait ø-tim am         m-ama Ayawasi         a
         3M ø-send letter 3U-go Ayawasi             INT
         ‘Should he send a letter to Ayawasi?’
   The fact that the result of the manipulation in the constructions in examples (135) and
(136) is at odds with the results in the other constructions, which are all like coordinating
constructions, is not a big problem: it is conceivable that m-amo cerek in (135) and m-ama
Ayawasi in (136) cannot be interpreted as main clauses, because they give the direction of
the action expressed in the first verb in the sequence, and are therefore semantically
inseparable from the first verb.
   However, (135) and (136) are not the only forms that are exceptional in behaviour. All
the constructions discussed so far in this section deviate from the coordinating sequences
216    Chapter 8in one important respect: to a certain extent, they allow extraction of objects, or, in other
words, they violate Ross’ CSC.
   Consider the following examples, all of which have an object on the first verb. In each
case, this object can be extracted, as illustrated in the b-forms:
(137) a.   y-hu     sekolah ø-farkor
           3M-stay school ø-study
           ‘He stays at school and studies.’
      b.   sekolah ro y-hu        Ø ø-farkor m-api
           school REL 3M-stay         ø-study 3U-big
           ‘The school where he stays and studies is big.’
(138) a.   y-po      pam y-fat       ara
           3M-hold axe 3M-fell tree
           ‘He holds the axe and fells the tree.’
      b.   pam ro y-po          Ø y-fat       ara ø-samuoh
           axe REL 3M-hold          3M-fell tree ø-heavy
           ‘The axe that he holds and fells the tree is heavy.’
(139) a.   y-ros     lapangan ø-kream po-safom
           3M-stand field         ø-collect NOM-green
           ‘He stands in the field and he collects grass.’
      b.   lapangan ro       y-ros      ø-kream po-safom m-of
           field       REL 3M-stand ø-collect NOM-green 3U-good
           ‘The field where he stands and collects grass is nice.’
   However, the object of the second verb, po-safom, cannot be extracted:
      c.   *po-safom ro y-ros     lapangan ø-kream Ø m-ria
           NOM-green REL 3M-stand field    ø-collect 3U-tall
   In all the b-examples in (137)–(139) the head (=the object of the first verb) of the RC
can be the understood ‘topic’ of that RC without resulting in a ‘logical conflict.’ In all non-
relativised instances in (137)–(139), the object of the first verb is also the semantic
‘subject’ of the second verb, which may explain why this object is allowed to become the
understood ‘topic’ of the sentence. This is not the case for po-safom in (139c), as it cannot
be the topic of the first clause in the RC y-ros lapangan, hence there is a logical conflict,
and the sentence is ungrammatical.
   If the first verb does not have an object, then the object on the second verb can be
extracted. In examples (140)–(143), the first verb can, but need not take an object. In all
these examples, the head of the RC can be understood as the topic of the entire RC, hence
the sentences are grammatical.

   Shared argument constructions are constructions where in a sequence of verbs the
object of the first verb is at the same time the subject of the second one. The second verb
may or may not take an object. In these sequences, the object of Verb1 (= subject of
Verb2) can be extracted, as shown in the b-varieties of examples (144)–(147) below. Like
the constructions above, the object on the second verb cannot be extracted, as illustrated in
the c-forms. Again, in each b-form the head of the resulting RC can be interpreted as the
understood topic of the utterance, which is not the case in the c-forms.

         rope REL Mafif 3M-take machete 3U-go   ø-snap
   There is another type of construction which violates the CSC, namely, so-called
‘valency-increasing’ constructions. These are constructions in which an extra argument can
be expressed by means of the addition of an extra verb. In Maybrat, the verb -e, translated
as ‘give’ can take at most two arguments, namely the ‘actor’ and the ‘patient’; there is no
room to express a third argument, for instance a ‘recipient’. The act of ‘giving something
to someone’ is expressed by two verbs in a construction which is semantically equivalent
to ‘X takes Y gives Z’, where Y is the object and Z the recipient of the object. That the
object, ‘Y’, can be extracted is demonstrated in example (148b). Note that in (148c) the RC
involves only one verb (-e ‘give’) and three arguments. In a main clause this is impossible,
for example *t-e ait tapak.
(148) a.    n-o     tapak n-e       ait
            2-take tobacco 2-give 3M
            ‘Take the tobacco and give it to him.’
      b.    tapak ro n-o         Ø n-e       ait okair sai
            tobacco REL 2-take       2-give 3M little only
            ‘The tobacco that you take and give to him is only a little.’
      c.    tapak ro n-e Ø ait okair sai
            tobacco REL 2-give 3M little only
            ‘The tobacco that you give him is only a little.’
   However, there also seem to be some exceptions to this pattern, especially in
constructions which feature three verbs. For example, whereas extraction of the object pam
‘axe’ out of example (149a) below is allowed, extraction of the object out of (150a) is
unacceptable. Apparently the head of the RC in (150b), pam ‘axe’, cannot be understood as
the ‘topic’ of the RC.
(149) a. y-ros      y-o       pam
          3M-stand 3M-take axe
          ‘He stands and takes the axe.’
                                                                     Sequences of verbs      219      b.   pam ro y-ros          y-o      Ø ø-samuoh
           axe REL 3M-stand 3M-take            ø-heavy
           ‘The axe that he stands and takes is heavy.’
(150) a.   y-ros      y-o      pam y-fat       ara
           3M-stand 3M-take axe 3M-fell tree
           ‘He stands and takes the axe and fells the tree.’
      b.   *pam ro y-ros     y-o     y-fat   ara ø-samuoh
            axe REL 3M-stand 3M-take 3M-fell tree ø-heavy
   It would be expected that in the following example, the object cannot be extracted.
However, example (151c), where the object of the second verb is extracted, was acceptable
to some informants. This can be explained in connection with the examples in (135) and
(136) above: semantically, the second verb -amo is closely connected to the first, as it
gives the direction of the action of the first verb. It is therefore conceivable that the head of
the RC in both (151b) and (151c) is understood as the topic of the following RC.
(151) a. ait ø-tim am         m-amo Ayawasi
         3M ø-send letter 3U-go Ayawasi
         ‘He sends a letter and it goes to Ayawasi.’
      b.   am     ro ait ø-tim Ø m-amo Ayawasi m-ria
           letter REL 3M ø-sent          3U-go Ayawasi 3U-long
           ‘The letter that he sent to Ayawasi is long.’
      c.   ?Ayawasi ro ait ø-tim am               m-amo Ø m-of
            Ayawasi REL 3M ø-send letter 3U-go            3U-good
           ‘Ayawasi that he sends a letter to is nice.’
   However, in example (152), extraction of the object of the third verb, tapam ‘land’ was
always considered acceptable, see for example (152c). Apparently tapam ‘land’ can be
understood as the topic of the RC. It is difficult to find a semantic motivation for the
unacceptability of (150b), and for the acceptability of (152c). It seems that in sequences
with three verbs, it cannot be completely predicted whether the object of a verb can or
cannot be extracted.
(152) a.   y-fat    aof        m-tie       m-ai tapam
           3M-fell sago.tree 3U-break 3U-hit land
           ‘He fells the sago tree and it breaks and hits the ground.’
      b.   aof       ro y-fat Ø m-tie               m-ai     tapam m-anes oh
           sago.tree REL 3M-fell        3U-break 3U-hit land          3U-old already
           ‘The sago tree that he fells and it breaks and hits the ground is already old.’
      c.   tapam ro y-fat     aof        m-tie      m-ai Ø hatat m-siar
           land REL 3M-fell sago.tree 3U-break 3U-hit            mud 3U-many
           ‘The ground on which he fells the sago tree and it breaks and crashes is
           very muddy.’
   In sequences of two verbs, of which one is a motion verb, a position verb, or a shared
argument construction verb, the first object can be extracted. Likewise, in ‘valency-
increasing’ constructions, the argument that functions as the object of the first verb and the
subject of the second verb can be extracted. Apparently, all these verbs, when combined
220    Chapter 8with other verbs, yield constructions from which objects can be extracted without giving
rise to ‘logical conflicts’ and hence unacceptability.
   In other words, these constructions seem similar to two types of construction discussed
before: they are similar to coordinating constructions from the point of view of intonation,
and morphology, and they behave largely the same when placed in the interrogative mood.
However, these forms violate the CSC. This makes them similar to the constructions
involving an object complement, which also ‘violate’ the CSC. Indeed, in many of the
problematic constructions the second clause can be analysed as an object complement of
the first clause, as illustrated below (see also the examples in §8.3):
(153) a.   ø-hren [[t-kom        am]]
           ø-sit     1S-write letter
           ‘I sit and write a letter.’
      b.   ø-hren [[tapam]]
           ø-sit     land
           ‘I sit on the ground.’
(154) a.   m-amo [[m-ate         aya]]
           3U-go 3U-go.under water
           ‘She goes and bathes.’
      b.   m-amo [[aya]]
           3U-go water
           ‘She goes to the river.’
   However, in §8.3 I illustrated that in constructions involving an object complement, a
pause between the two verbs can bring about a significant change in meaning. This is not
the case for these ‘problematic’ verb sequences. Thus, according to the criteria set in this
chapter, they keep a middle way between coordinating constructions and constructions
involving an object complement.
   A case could be made for the presence of serial verb constructions in Maybrat. In what
are claimed to be serialising languages, the motion verbs ‘come’ and ‘go’ and the position
verbs ‘stand’ and ‘stay’ are commonly found in serial verb constructions (Foley & Olson
1985:41–42). The same is true for a verb like -o, which expresses a semantic function
similar to ‘instrumental’ (Sebba 1987:162). Likewise, ‘shared argument’ constructions,
such as ‘X kills Y dies’, as in example (145) above, are common in serialising languages
(Sebba 1987:197). Hamel (1993) refers to this type of construction as ‘causative/result’
where the main verb is the cause, and the serial verb is the result. And lastly, serialising
languages often use ‘valency-increasing’ constructions to make it possible to add an extra
argument to an expression (Foley & Olson 1985:48; Sebba 1987:216; Zwicky 1990:3).
   The question is if the constructions discussed in this section really qualify as ‘serial’.
The term ‘serial verb construction’ itself has been the subject of much debate in recent
linguistic literature. Zwicky (1990:2) states that the term ‘serial’ is often used to refer to
juxtaposed verbs in general, without stating explicitly the relationship between these verbs.
Thus, if taken loosely, all the sequences of verbs in this chapter qualify as serial. However,
in the literature the term ‘serial’ is usually applied to a specific type of verb series. Some
formal criteria that apply to ‘serial verb constructions’ are as follows:
                                                                    Sequences of verbs     221   (a)   They have only one overtly expressed (syntactic) subject (Sebba 1987:86).
   (b)   There must be no ascertainable clause boundary between the two verbs
         (Sebba 1987:39).
   (c)   There cannot be any overt conjunctions between the verbs (Zwicky 1990:4;
         Foley & Olson 1985:18; Sebba 1987:39).
   (d)   All the verbs have the same aspect, tense and mood (Zwicky 1990:4; Foley &
         Olson 1985:28; Sebba 1987:39).
   (e)   Verbs in a serial verb construction must also be able to occur as single
         predicates.
   (f)   The serial verbs refer to one single event (Comrie 1995:26).
   The problematic constructions discussed in this section clearly qualify for some of these
criteria, while violating others: all the verbs can occur as single predicates, thus qualifying
for criterion (e). However, they have more than one overtly expressed subject (in the form
of an obligatory person prefix); there may be an ascertainable clause boundary between the
verbs in the form of a pause; there may be an overt conjunction between the verbs; and the
verbs need not always have the same aspect, tense and mood, thus failing criterion (a), (b),
(c) and (d) respectively. The problem is the use of the word ‘may’ in the above: for
instance, a pause ‘may’ be inserted between two verbs in a putative serial verb
construction, rendering it into a coordinating construction. In sequences in which the
second clause clearly functions as a complement without a pause, insertion of a pause
changes the construction into a coordinating one, albeit with a significant change in
meaning. In a putative serial verb construction, does the insertion of a pause also change
the constituency of the construction? Semantically, there is no significant difference in
meaning in constructions with and without a pause, both are coordinating. However, given
the small syntactic deviation from the coordinating ‘norm’, that is violation of the CSC, it
seems that these constructions are at least remotely serial in character, despite the fact that
they fail most of the criteria (see above).","[227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239]"
"6.4 The object
   Like subject NPs, object NPs can also be omitted without violating the grammaticality
of an utterance. This is illustrated in the pairs in (20)–(22) below, where in the a-varieties
the clause has a nominal object, and in the b-varieties this object is absent.

             ‘She finds a bird.’

             3U-find
             ‘She finds (something).’
(21) a.      m-ape               ku
             3U-carry.on.back child
             ‘She carries a child on her back.’
       b.    m-ape
             3U-carry.on.back
             ‘She carries (something) on her back.’
(22) a.      t-e        am
             3U-give letter
             ‘I give a letter.’
       b.    t-e
             1S-give
             ‘I give.’
   Like the omission of subject NPs, the motivation for omitting objects from clauses
which contain a transitive verb is pragmatic: if the object is referred to earlier in the
discourse, and is hence known to the listener, then it can be omitted. In example (23), the
object of m-tah ‘They eat small meat’ is ru r-ana ‘their bird’. ‘Ø’ refers to an omitted
object.
(23)         m-e       u     na       m-akuos         ru   r-ana   m-nan
             3U-return again and.then 3U-roast        bird POSS-3P 3U-enough

           3U-eat.small.meat
           ‘They returned again and then they roasted their bird and after that they ate (it).’
   Another example is given in the passage in (24)–(26). In (25) the implied object of
m-aut ‘They climb’ is ara wisam ‘“wisam” tree’, given in (24). In (26) the implied object
of m-ehoh is apan, occurring earlier in the same sentence.
(24)       ku    eok m-amo m-aut        ara wisam3
           child two 3U-go 3U-climb {tree wisam}
           ‘Two children went and climbed a “wisam” tree.’
(25)       m-aut     Ø na          m-kai apan
           3U-climb     and.then 3U-find snake
           ‘They climbed and they found a snake.’
(26)       m-kai     apan m-arak         ana eok m-ehoh Ø
           3U-meet snake 3U-empty 3U two 3U-stab
           ‘After they found the snake the two stabbed (=killed) (it).’
   Omission of nominal arguments is also attested in other Papuan languages and,
according to Foley, characteristic of the fact that in Papuan languages morphology is more
important in the organisation of the grammar than syntax (Foley 1986:168–171). Although
Maybrat has little morphology, and word order is relevant in the organisation of the
grammar, the ‘dropping’ of nominal objects is allowed. As far as I know, any ‘transitive’
verb can also occur without its object, and still be acceptable.","[164, 165]"
"4.2.4 Derivation on verbs: -i-
   The derivational affix -i- ‘TRANS’ changes the valency of verbs from intransitive to
transitive. This affix in turn takes a person prefix that must be coreferent with the subject
82      Chapter 4of the following verb. Therefore, it is possible that -i- has a verbal origin. The affix -i also
occurs as an independent verb meaning ‘tie’, as in (110), but it seems unlikely that the
form -i- in the sequence -i- + V is semantically related to -i ‘tie’.
(110)        ait y-i      fane m-ao
             3M 3M-tie pig 3U-leg
             ‘He ties the pig’s leg.’
   Derivation with -i- applies to a restricted number of verbs only, and does not seem to be
productive. There are two types of verbs that can undergo derivation with -i-, which are
given below:
   To begin, -i- can precede verbs that semantically refer to ‘break’:
(111)         -tie     ‘break (sticks)’
              ktus     ‘break (ropes)’
              ftah     ‘break (shells)’
   Below, in the a-forms the verbs are used intransitively, while in the b-forms they
function as transitive verbs. These verbs must take a derivational affix -i- when functioning
as transitive verbs, as in (114), derived from (112b), which is ungrammatical.
(112) a.      ara m-tie
              tree 3U-break
              ‘The tree breaks.’
        b.    tuo t-i-t-tie        ara
              1S 1S-TRANS-1S-break tree
              ‘I break the tree.’
(113) a.      son     m-arak       ø-ftah
              coconut 3U-empty ø-break
              ‘The coconut shell breaks.’
        b.    y-i-ø-ftah          son        m-arak
              3M-TRANS-ø-break coconut 3U-shell/skin
              ‘He breaks the coconut-shell.’
(114)         *t-tie   ara
              1S-break tree
   Secondly, the verb frok ‘emerge’ can function as a transitive verb, as illustrated in
(115). If frok takes a derivational affix -i-, the meaning of the verb changes to ‘take out’. A
contrastive example is given in (116). The prefix on -i- must be coreferent with the subject
of the verb, see (116b) and (117).
(115)         ara re-f-o                     ø-frok   Siwa y-naif

              ‘The wood emerges from Siwa’s nose.’

         thing ø-emerge 3U-from cupboard
         ‘Something emerges out of the cupboard.’

            ‘I take something out of the cupboard.’
(117)       ait y-i-ø-frok             po     m-pat   lemari
            3M 3M-TRANS-ø-emerge thing 3U-from cupboard
            ‘He takes something out of the cupboard.’
   Three verb forms that formally include i are -isapos ‘brush’, -isasie ‘wrap up’ and
-iwarok ‘insert’. These verb forms always function as transitive verbs. The i in these forms
is likely to be a transitivising prefix, so that the morphological representation of these
verbs could be -i-ø-sapos, -i-ø-sasie and -i-ø-warok. These forms are apparently fossilised
forms, since their putative intransitive counterparts, that is *ø-sapos, *ø-sasie and
*ø-warok are unattested in the data. Some examples of these transitive verbs are:
(118)       ait y-i-ø-sapos          onfuk
            3M 3M-TRANS-ø-brush clothes
            ‘He brushed the clothes.’

            ‘They wrap up the meat.’
(120)       to-tis          to-f-o                 m-aut18 m-i-ø-warok              sai
            area.N-behind area.N-very.near-U 3U-climb 3U-TRANS-ø-insert only
            ‘At the back here, they lift (the loincloth) up and they just tuck it (into the
            rope around their waist).’4.3 Nouns
   Maybrat nouns can be defined according to the following syntactic criteria: firstly, they
can be modified by a number of items in an NP, as in (121) (see also Chapter 5); secondly,
they can follow a locative adverb, as in (122) (see §4.7.4); and thirdly, they can function as
the subject or the object in a clause, as in (123) and (124) respectively (see also Chapter 6).
In the examples below, the nouns are underlined:
(121)       amah m-api re-t-o
            house 3U-big location.SPEC-near-U
            ‘this big house’
(122)       fra    m-hu kait m-ata
            stone 3U-stay near 3U-leaf
            ‘The stone is near the leaf.’
(123)       t-atia    y-asah
            1S-father 3M-laugh
            ‘My father laughs.’
18
     In this context, the verb -aut ‘climb’ refers to ‘getting dressed’. Another example is t-aut celana ‘I get
     dressed in trousers’.
84        Chapter 4(124)       ait y-po       pron
            3M 3M-hold bamboo
            ‘He holds the bamboo.’
    A distinction can be made between inalienably possessed nouns and alienably possessed
nouns. Inalienably possessed nouns take a person prefix, whereas alienably possessed
nouns cannot. However, this morphological criterion does not always work, since
inalienably possessed nouns take prefixes in exactly the same way as verbs, as was
illustrated in §3.1. In other words, some inalienably possessed nouns take a covert person
prefix because of morphophonological constraints. The distinction between inalienably and
alienably possessed nouns must therefore be made according to two criteria, namely
morphological, and syntactic. The following criteria apply:
     a.    Inalienably possessed nouns take an overt or covert person prefix;
           the order in possessive constructions where the inalienably possessed noun
           expresses the possessed is ‘possessor-possessed’.
     b.    Alienably possessed nouns never take a person prefix;
           the order in possessive constructions where the alienably possessed noun
           expresses the possessed is ‘possessed-possessor’.
    Below, I will begin with a description of the morphological and syntactic properties of
firstly inalienably possessed nouns in §4.3.1 and secondly alienably possessed nouns in
§4.3.2. In §4.3.3, I will discuss gender and number for both inalienably and alienably
possessed nouns. In §4.3.4 the different types of derivation of nouns from words from
other word classes is illustrated. Finally, in §4.3.5, noun compounds are discussed.","[99, 100, 101, 102]"

              3U-many REL 3M-plant near-U 3U-nice5.1.6 Determiner
    The determiner in the NP must formally be a demonstrative that can only function
attributively, that is carrying the prefix re- ‘location.SPEC’, we- ‘location.GEN’, te- ‘area.N’,
or ti- ‘side.N’ These demonstrative forms were described in §4.4. Demonstratives occur in
NP-final position, as the preceding examples in this chapter illustrate.
    Demonstratives that can function as determiners in an NP can also be used as
substantives. Note, however, that this is only the case for full demonstrative forms of this
type. That is, f-o, t-o and n-o cannot be used as substantives. When demonstratives are
used as substantives, they cannot be further modified. Some examples follow:
(45)         re-t-o                  m-of, ro-n-o             m-kair
             location.SPEC-near-U 3U-nice location.SPEC-far-U 3U-bad
             ‘This one is nice, that one is bad.’
(46)         m-ruk        re-t-o
             3U-submerge location.SPEC-near-U
             ‘They submerged that.’
   The unmarked demonstrative base au ‘DIST.U’ can be used as a substantive:
(47)         Sely m-hu au
             Sely 3u-stay DIST.U
             ‘Sely will stay here.’
   Like quantifying verbs, demonstratives in subject or object position cannot be extracted
through relativisation, as illustrated in examples (48) and (49).

             location.SPEC-very.near-U REL 1S-go5.2 Possessive noun phrases
   In §4.3.1 and §4.3.2, I introduced two types of possessive construction, and I used them
as a criterion to distinguish between alienably and inalienably possessed nouns: in
possessive constructions where the inalienably possessed noun expresses the possessed the
order of the nouns is ‘possessor-possessed’, while in constructions where the alienably
possessed noun expresses the possessed, the order is reversed, that is ‘possessed-
possessor’. In the latter, the possessive marker ro precedes the possessor. Examples with
inalienably possessed nouns (50) and (51), and with alienably possessed nouns (52) and
(53) are summarised below:
(50)        Yan y-atia
            Yan 3M-father
            ‘Yan’s father’
(51)        aof m-ake
            sago 3U-fruit
            ‘the fruit of the sago’
(52)        amah ro-Sely
            house POSS-Sely
            ‘Sely’s house’
(53)        fane r-ait
            pig POSS-3M
            ‘his pig’
   In an NP, a possessive construction can be modified by a number phrase, as illustrated
in examples (54)–(56):
(54)        ru m-aim        ewok
            bird 3U-wing two
            ‘two bird’s wings’
(55)        mikie9 r-ait       m-ana krem      s-au
            co.wife POSS-3M 3U-head finger/toe one-3U
            ‘his six co-wives’
(56)        tfo kawia r-ait       s-au
            {knife} POSS-3M one-U
            ‘his one small knife’9
    Given the order of constituents in the possessive construction ø-mikie r-ait ‘his co-wives’, I assume that
    this is an alienably possessed noun, although semantically it could well be a kinship term.
136         Chapter 5    An inalienably possessed noun can itself be a possessor in a ‘possessed-possessor’
construction, cf. examples (57) and (58). In (59), a ‘possessor-possessed’ construction is
itself the possessor in a ‘possessed-possessor’ construction. This illustrates that possessive
constructions, like regular NPs, are a recursive category.
(57)         fane ro-t-atia
             pig POSS-1S-father
             ‘my father’s pig’
(58)         amah ro-y-fain
             house POSS-3M-wife
             ‘his wife’s house’
(59)         tfo       ro-Yan     y-atia
             machete POSS-Yan 3M-father
             ‘Yan’s father’s knife’
   Theoretically, the number of times a possessive construction can be repeated within a
possessive construction is infinite. However, constructions larger than example (59)
rapidly become unintelligible, and they are unattested in the data of spontaneous speech.
The examples in (60) below were obtained through elicitation. Whereas (60a), in which
two NPs are juxtaposed, is possible, (60b) is preferred. In the latter, the possessive
construction fane ro-t-ao ku r-au is separated by the numeral m-ana tuf by means of the
coordinator mati ‘and then’.
(60) a.      fane ro-t-ao                  ku     r-au m-ana tuf
             pig POSS-1S-relative.SS child POSS-3U 3U-head three
             ‘my sister’s pig, its three piglets’
       b.    fane ro-t-ao                ku      r-au     mati m-ana tuf
             pig POSS-1S-relative.SS child POSS-3U and.then 3U-head three
             ‘My sister’s child’s pigs, there are three.’5.3 Relative clauses
    Relative clauses (RCs) are characterised as consisting of a head and a restricting clause
(Comrie 1989:143). Semantically, the function of a restricting clause is to narrow down the
set of possible referents of the head noun to a subset, by providing specific information
about a head (cf. Comrie 1989:143; Dik 1997:25). In Maybrat, RCs conform to this basic
characterisation. The restrictive clause is marked by ro ‘REL’ (see example (1c) above).
    The ordering of the head noun and the restricting clause in Maybrat is regular from a
typological point of view: if in a language the determiner follows the head noun in an NP,
the restricting clause also follows the head noun (cf. Croft 1990:47–48, 84).
    The discussion in this section is restricted to the structure of relative clauses: RC-
formation, that is which positions in a clause can be relativised, is described in §6.7.
    Some examples of RCs appear below. Nouns — (61) and (62); pronouns — (63); and
numerals — (64) can function as the head of an RC. RCs headed by a determiner or a
quantifier are unattested in the data. Recall that in the discussion on ‘regular’ NPs I
illustrated that quantifiers and determiners can take the place of an NP, that is they can be
used as substantives, but that in this function they cannot be modified. It is therefore
                                                                            Noun phrases   137natural that they cannot head an RC, since an RC includes a modifier, that is a restricting
clause.
(61)        Simon ro y-men        Maria ø-kiyam
            Simon REL 3M-marry Maria ø-ill
            ‘Simon who married Maria is ill.’
(62)        amah ro y-hu         re-t-o            m-api
            house REL 3M-stay location.SPEC-near-U 3U-big
            ‘This house where he lives is big.’
(63)        ait ro y-eyam tapak10 y-nit              po-mna
            3M REL 3M-roll tobacco 3M-tell NOM-tell.tale
            ‘He who rolls a cigarette tells a tale.’
(64)        eok ro m-hu amah m-aim             po-iit
            two rel 3U-stay house 3U-cook NOM-eat.P
            ‘The two who stay at home cook food.’
   A restricting clause can also contain another restricting clause. This is illustrated in
example (65) — derived from (61) — in which Maria, the object in the restricting clause
y-men Maria, is modified by the restricting clause ro ø-kiyam:
(65)        Simon ro y-men         Maria ro ø-kiyam y-anes oh
            Simon REL 3M-marry Maria REL ø-ill             3M-old already
            ‘Simon who married the ill Maria (as opposed to the healthy Maria) is
            already old.’
   In the examples above, the restricting clause is formally a clause. In the examples
below, an adverb — (66) and (67), a numeral — (68), a demonstrative — (69), or a
location marker — (70) (see §4.8.1) occur in the place of a restricting clause, and function
as modifiers to the head of the RC. If a numeral functions as a restricting clause, as in (68),
the result is an ordinal construction (see §4.6).

   The head of an RC may be omitted. Omission of a head may occur if a referent has
already been introduced in the discourse. In examples (71) and (72), the head of the first
RC is rae ‘person’. This is also the understood head of every subsequent restricting clause.
In the forms below, the RCs are juxtaposed (see §5.4).
(71)     rae     m-siar,   ro m-anes, ro m-aku
         person 3U-many REL 3U-old REL 3U-small
         ‘There are many people, old ones, young ones.’

         NOM-fell   REL 3U-build fence     all      REL 3U-go 3U-yank.out taro
         ‘There were many people who planted (lit. ‘The man who plants, there were
         many’), who burned things, who felled trees (lit. ‘fell-things’, i.e. things that
         need to be felled), who built fences, who went and yanked out taro.’
   In the example below, the head of the RC is given in the previous NP fane re-t-o ‘this
pig’.
(73)     fane re-t-o,                   ro m-api, m-ait ora
         pig location.SPEC-near-U REL 3U-big 3U-eat garden
         ‘This pig, the big one, it ate from the garden.’5.4 The element ro
  So far, the element ro has been described in two syntactic functions, namely as a
possessive marker and as a marker of the restricting clause in RCs. An example of each
appears below:
(74)     amah ro-tuo
         house POSS-1S
         ‘my house’
(75)     aof ro ana m-fat
         sago REL 3P 3U-fell
         ‘The sago tree that they felled.’
   Possessive constructions and RC-constructions are syntactically and semantically very
similar. Syntactically, they all have a nominal head followed by a modifier marked by ro.
In both types of construction, the entire constituent is an NP because it can function as a
subject or object in a clause. Semantically, in each construction, [ro + constituent]
functions as a modifier to the nominal head. The exact function of this modifier is to
narrow down the potential referents expressed by the head. For example, in (74) the
referent of the generic term ‘house’ is narrowed down to one item, namely ‘the house that
is mine’. Likewise, in (75), the referent of the generic term ‘sago tree’ is narrowed down to
                                                                                         Noun phrases         139the item ‘the sago tree that they felled’. In general terms, ro marks the following
constituent as a ‘specifier’. Thus, ro ‘POSS’ and ro ‘REL’ are arguably related.
    The marker ro is, in turn, possibly related to the demonstrative prefix re-
‘location.SPEC’. In §4.4.1, I illustrated that re- occurs in demonstratives that function
attributively, and that it is used if the head noun is specific, that is if the head noun can be
pinpointed. An example follows:
(76)        amah re-f-o
            house location.SPEC-very.near-U
            ‘this house’
   If example (76) is compared to (74) and (75) above, it is not difficult to see a possible
relation: syntactically, re- ‘location.SPEC’ and ro ‘POSS’/‘REL’ are restricted to the
environment of NPs. All follow a nominal head in an NP. Pragmatically, all mark the
following constituent, whether this is an NP, an RC or a demonstrative form, as a modifier
of the head. In many languages, relative clause markers derive from demonstratives,
interrogatives, or relative pronouns. This is in accordance with their function, namely to
specify or determine the referent of the noun (Hopper & Traugott 1993:195–196).
Himmelmann (1996) argues that demonstratives and RC-markers are often related. He
argues that the common function of both is their recognitional use: they make referents
more accessible in discourse (Himmelmann 1996:230). In Maybrat, not ‘accessibility’ but
rather ‘specificity’ is the common functional denominator.","[151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"
"7.1.3.3 Location
   The location question words to-yo ‘where’ (area.N-INT), wo-yo ‘where’ (area.GEN-INT)
and mi-yo ‘where’ (PRESTT-INT) occur in clause-final position, like the location periphery.
Some examples involving to-yo are given in (38)–(40). Recall that the location marker to-
is used to refer to a specific area, that is one that can be pinpointed, as opposed to wo-,
which refers to a more general area. The form mi- is used for presentative forms. The
reader is referred to §4.5 for a more detailed discussion of the differences in meaning
between these three interrogative forms.

    Examples with wo-yo appear in (41) and (42):
(41)      fane m-ait ora          wo-yo
          pig 3U-eat garden LOC.GEN-INT
          ‘The pig eats the garden (approximately) where?’

    Some examples with mi-yo:
(43)      ana m-awe kak       m-apo mi-yo
          3P 3U-say meat 3U-be PRESTT-INT

          person REL 3U-run 3U-go PRESTT-INT
          ‘Where did the person who ran go?’
   The forms to-yo and mi-yo can also question an NP. The form wo-yo is unattested in this
function:
(46)      pose      p-oa hani9          belanga       po      to-yo

          3M 3M-say child PRESTT-INT
          ‘He says: “Where is the child?”’7.1.3.4 Manner
  Like manner adverbials, the manner interrogative fi-ye occupies the clause-final
position:108
   This sentence is taken out of a text which gives a description of what will happen to the land if the secret
   of Wuon, i.e. the initiation ritual for men, is discovered by outsiders.
9
   This is possibly a compound form, including -oa ‘not know’. Compare srohni ‘forget’, in which sroh is
   ‘forget’. Both forms include ni as a final element. The element ha in -oa hani is unattested in the data.
10
   The example below is taken from a letter written to me when I was in Ayawasi. The sentence may be a
   direct translation from Indonesian, which would account for the fact that fi-ye occurs in clause-initial
   position: the corresponding Indonesian bagaimana ‘how’ would also occupy the clause-initial position.
       fi-ye            arin        ro-nuo Ayawasi

          and.then LOC-behind similar.to-INT LOC-behind similar.to-INT
          ‘And in the end how will it be, in the end how will it be?’
   The word wo-yo, which usually functions as a location question word, can also function
as a manner question word, in which case it is translated as ‘how’:11
(51)      m-orie12 t-no wo-yo
          3U-now 1S-do LOC.GEN-INT
          ‘How shall I do it?’7.2 Imperative
   The function of the imperative is to give commands or instructions. There are two ways
of forming the imperative. The first type of imperative is marked phonologically: the
speaker used a loud voice in order to give emphasis to the utterance. There are no syntactic
markers. Some examples:
(52)      n-ait
          2-eat
          ‘Eat!’
(53)      n-iit
          2-eat.P
          ‘Eat (plural)!’
(54)      n-ama amah
          2-come house
          ‘Come to the house!’
(55)      n-ama ø-srot
          2-come ø-quickly
          ‘Come quickly!’
    The second type of imperative is characterised by the presence of the focus adverb re in
clause-final position. Imperatives formed with re are milder than the intonationally marked
imperatives discussed above. The difference between the two types of imperative is
illustrated in examples (56) and (52):
11
   This was the only example wo-yo ‘how’: it may be an exception to the rule, although the example was
   checked with different people, and invariably translated as indicated.
12
   The form m-orie is attested in the data a few times. I assume that it is a predicative form of the temporal
   adverb orie ‘later’. Thus, m-orie constitutes a clause, in which m- functions as a person prefix.
                                                                          Mood    185(56)    n-ait re
        2-eat please
        ‘Please eat.’
(57)    n-ama re
        2-come please
        ‘Come, please.’
  The form mai ‘PROHIB’ marks the prohibitive, or, in other words, the negative of the
imperative. Like re, mai is placed in clause-final position. Some examples are:
(58)    n-aut ara mai
        2-climb tree PROHIB
        ‘Don’t climb into the tree.’
(59)    n-kias fai         m-api t-o mai
        2-tell woman 3U-big near-U PROHIB
        ‘Don’t tell this old woman.’
8              Sequences of verbs   Sequences of verbal forms (plus their arguments, if any) which together constitute one
sentence occur commonly in Maybrat, as they do indeed in many Papuan languages (see,
for instance Foley 1986:175–176). Superficially many of these sequences look alike. For
instance, morphologically (1) and (2) look similar because each verb carries a person
prefix. However, they are quite different in constituency. Example (1) represents a
coordinating construction, in which each verb constitutes a separate clause. This is
indicated in the translation. In order to coordinate clauses, an overt coordinator, like
English ‘and’ is not needed in Maybrat. Example (1) is formally similar to (2), so there is
nothing that prevents us from interpreting (2) as ‘He speaks and he stabs a cuscus.’
However, syntactically these constructions are quite different: in (2), y-ame kak ‘he kills a
cuscus’ is an object complement of y-awe. Likewise, by analogy to (1), (3) could be
translated as ‘He goes and he towards the sago tree’ although this translation sounds odd.
In (3), y-kit aof functions as the locative object of the verb y-amo.
(1)      y-apo y-ata
         3M-eat 3M-drink
         ‘He eats and he drinks.’
(2)      y-awe y-ame kak
         3M-say 3M-stab cuscus
         ‘He wants to stab a cuscus.’
(3)      rae    y-amo y-kit           aof
         person 3M-go 3M-towards sago.tree
         ‘The man goes towards the sago tree.’
    The question, of course, is in what ways one type of verb sequence differs from another,
and what criteria can be used to describe these distinctions. In the present chapter I will
illustrate how with a number of different criteria the syntactic differences between the
sequences like those in examples (1)–(3) can be described. The different types of verb
sequences that can be identified in Maybrat are listed below (including the section where
they are discussed):
                                            186
                                                                   Sequences of verbs     187          §8.1     coordinating constructions, as in (1)
          §8.2     adverbial verbs
          §8.3     constructions involving an object complement, as in (2)
          §8.4     prepositional verbs, as in (3)
          §8.5     comitatives
          §8.6     a problematic category
    The chapter is set up as follows: In §8.1, I will present a discussion of coordinating
sequences of verbs. They are characterised according to three different types of criteria,
namely intonational (§8.1.1); morphological (§8.1.2); and syntactic (§8.1.3). In the section
on syntax, I will perform three tests that bring out the constituency of these coordinating
verb sequences: insertion of an overt coordinator; examination of the scope of the
interrogative marker a; and relativisation on the object of a clause. Having established the
properties of coordinating sequences of verbs, I will contrast other types of juxtaposed
verbal forms with these coordinating sequences. In §8.2, I discuss what will be referred to
as adverbial verbs, that is sequences that include a verb which functions as a modifier to a
main verb. Section 8.3 concentrates on sequences in which the second verb (and its
arguments or modifiers) functions as an object complement of the first verb. In these
sequences, the first verb may be a perception verb; a mental activity verb; the causative
verb -no ‘do’; or the verb -awe ‘say’. Section 8.4 discusses prepositional verbs. I will show
that some prepositional verbs have more ‘verbal’ properties than others. The latter behave
more like prepositions. In §8.5, I will describe some syntactic properties of comitative
constructions.
    Having used relativisation as a syntactic test for the constituency of sequences of verbs
in this chapter, in §8.6 I will summarise some properties of the relativisability of arguments
in different syntactic types of constructions. I will relate these facts to Keenan and
Comrie’s ‘Accessibility Hierarchy’. Finally, in §8.7, I will present some types of verb
sequences that share properties with both the coordinating constructions discussed in §8.1,
and the constructions involving an object complement. These constructions resemble
constructions that are labelled ‘serial verb constructions’ (SVCs) in the literature.
    In the remainder of this chapter, if I refer to ‘verb’, it is implied that this includes a
verbal form plus its arguments, unless otherwise stated. I realise that strictly speaking,
‘verb’ refers to a morphological entity, whereas in this section the functional
characteristics, or the constituency of the verbal forms, are discussed. However, using the
term ‘clause’ for these entities is misleading, since it will appear that some verbal forms
are not clausal. Therefore, ‘verb’ is chosen as a neutral umbrella term.","[200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205]"
"3.1.1 Forms that take an overt person prefix
    Forms that take overt person prefixes can be divided into three formally different types:
first, all forms with vowel-initial stems take an overt person prefix. The paradigm of the
verb /-isi/ ‘agree’ in (2) is illustrative of this. In these forms a person prefix is overt
because this prefix does not add an extra syllable (V) to the final form. Some examples:
(3) a.     /t-ate/     [»t-ate]     CV|CV        ‘I bathe’
    b.     /y-ehoh/    [»j-exçx]    CV|CVC       ‘he stabs’
    c.     /n-akut/    [»n-akut]    CV|CVC       ‘your son’
  Some more examples of forms with V-initial stems that take overt person prefixes
appear in (4).
(4)        /t-e/        CV              ‘I give’
           /t-o/        CV              ‘I take’
           /t-amo/      CV|CV           ‘I go’
           /t-ia/       CV|V            ‘I suck’
           /t-usiax/    CV|CV|VC        ‘I hunt’
           /t-ao/       CV|V            ‘my foot, my sibling (SS)’
           /t-oni/      CV|CV           ‘my cheek’
           /t-atia/     CV|CV|V         ‘my father’
   A second category of forms that receive an overt person prefix are monosyllabic stems
with a stem-initial C, namely CV or CVC. An example is the paradigm of the verb /-po/
‘hold’ in (2). Affixing of a person prefix results in a CC-cluster in word-initial position. As
pointed out in §2.2.2, these CC-clusters are broken up by an epenthetic schwa. Because the
epenthetic schwa is syllabic (see §2.3.2), the resulting form consists of two syllables:
                                                                    Morphophonology       51(5) a.                     ơ ơ
            /y-ros/      [j´-»rçs]       CV|CVC             ‘he stands’
       b.                  ơ ơ
            /n-hu/       [n´-»xu]        CV|CV              ‘you stay’
       c.                  ơ ơ
            /m-pat/      [m´-»pAt]       CV|CVC             ‘her tooth; they are from’
      Some more examples of forms with monosyllabic stems appear in (6):
(6)         /t-no/       CV|CV           ‘I do’
            /t-se/       CV|CV           ‘I place’
            /t-nit/      CV|CVC          ‘I tell a story’
            /t-per/      CV|CVC          ‘I step on’
            /t-me/       CV|CV           ‘my mother’
            /t-xaf/      CV|CVC          ‘my stomach’
   There are a number of forms which have bisyllabic stems, yet do take overt person
prefixes. These forms have stems of the form CV|V(C), that is the second syllable is
V-initial. Some examples:
(7) a.      /n-kai/      [n´-»kai]        CV|CV|V           ‘you meet’
    b.      /y-naif/     [j´-»naif]       CV|CV|VC          ‘his nose’
    c.      /m-wau/      [mç-»wau]        CV|CV|V           ‘they roast’
    d.      /t-kias/     [t´-ki»jAs]      CV|CV|VC          ‘I tell’
    e.      /y-suo/      [j´-su»wo]       CV|CV|V           ‘he defecates’
    f.      /m-sia/      [m´-si»ja]       CV|CV|V           ‘they are with’
   However, all these forms contain a vowel /i/ or /u/ which in elliptic speech may be
reduced to [j] or [w] respectively (see §2.6), thus resulting in a phonetically monosyllabic
stem:
(8) a.      /n-kai/      [n´-»kaj]        CV|CVC             ‘you meet’
    b.      /y-naif/     [j´-»najf]       CV|CVCC            ‘his nose’
    c.      /m-wau/      [mç-»waw]        CV|CVC             ‘they roast’
    d.      /t-kias/     [t´-»kjAs]       CV|CCVC            ‘I tell’
       e.   /y-suo/      [j´-»swo]        CV|CCV             ‘he defecates’
       f.   /m-sia/      [m´-»sja]        CV|CCV             ‘they are with’
   In other words, the phonetic realisation of the forms in (8) seems to be the input for the
morphophonological behaviour: these forms behave like the monosyllabic stems discussed

3.1.2 Forms that take a covert person prefix
   Bisyllabic stems of the form CV|CV(C), that is forms in which the second syllable is
C-initial, take covert person prefixes. Covert person prefixes are person prefixes that are
not phonologically realised. In (10a) a form with two full syllables is given. Examples
(10b) and (10c) are CC-initial, where the first syllable contains an (epenthetic) syllabic
schwa. The starred forms give the unacceptable trisyllabic forms after addition of an overt
person prefix.1
(10) a.     /xawe/ [»xawe]         CV|CV           ‘I refuse’          *[t-´»xawe]
                                                   ‘you refuse’
                                                   etc.
       b.   /snuk/    [s´»nuk] CV|CVC              ‘I count’           *[t-´s´»nuk]
                                                   ‘you count’
                                                   etc.
       c.   /fri/     [f´»ri]      CV|CV           ‘I meet’            *[t-´f´»ri]
                                                   ‘you meet’
                                                   etc.
   Some more examples of bisyllabic stems appear in (11) (forms consisting of two
syllables), and (12) (forms with an epenthetic schwa in the first syllable).
(11)        /kapuk/             CV|CVC             ‘I close eyes’

            /tumuk/             CV|CVC             ‘I ask’
(12)        /ste/               CV|CV              ‘I wait’
            /tpe/               CV|CV              ‘I open’
            /xmun/              CV|CVC             ‘my chest’
            /frok/              CV|CVC             ‘I emerge’
            /krun/              CV|CVC             ‘I throw inside’
            /krek/              CV|CVC             ‘my armpit’

    In all the forms that take covert person prefixes, only the gloss for first person singular, and in the first
    example of each type, that for the second person singular, has been given. Of course, other glosses also
    apply.

stems in (10)–(12), the person prefix is never phonologically expressed.

   In Maybrat, any form consisting of an overtly prefixed verb can function as a clause,
that is as a constituent consisting minimally of a predicate (the morphological verb) and its
arguments (its person prefix) (see Chapter 6, Introduction, and §6.2). Verbal forms with a
phonologically repressed person prefix can function as a clause just like forms with a
phonologically expressed person prefix. Any form without a phonologically expressed
person prefix can also function as a clause. For the sake of consistence, I assume that those
forms with and those without a phonologically expressed person prefix are structurally
similar. Therefore, I introduce a zero prefix ‘ø-’ to represent the phonologically repressed
person prefix in these forms.
   I do realise that the introduction of a ‘zero-morpheme’ may seem redundant, since its
occurrence is restricted to two word classes, namely the class of verbs (§4.2) and the class
of inalienably possessed nouns (§4.3.1). Often, the word class that a form belongs to is
clear from its syntactic behaviour, and, given the morphophonological description here, the
absence of an overt person prefix on these forms can be predicted. However, I have chosen
to mark covert person prefixes throughout this work for two reasons: firstly, and crucially,
there are a number of forms where the presence versus the absence of a person prefix plays
a role: for example, number phrases are headed by a prefixless inalienably possessed
pronoun. Addition of a person prefix could render a different meaning (see §5.1.4). In
adverbial verbs the presence versus the absence of a person prefix is also crucial to the
meaning of an utterance (§8.2). The only way to adequately describe these forms is by
introducing a zero-morpheme, which can, just like overt morphemes, be omitted in the
description where this is required. Secondly, typologically, in many languages the
description of sequences of verbs (or serial verb constructions) hinges on the presence
versus the absence of inflection on the verbs. In my view, the description of sequences of
verbs in Maybrat (Chapter 8) is unambiguous by marking all the inflections, be they overt
or covert. This prevents misinterpretations about the syntactic behaviour of the verbs in
these sequences.","[68, 69, 70, 71]"
"4.3.4 Derivation of nouns
   In Maybrat, there are three different ways in which verbs can be nominalised. I will
refer to these as objective nominalisation, instrumental nominalisation, and agentive
nominalisation (Comrie & Thompson 1985:351–356). These terms are semantically
motivated: they refer to the type of noun that is produced in nominalisation. For instance,
in instrumental nominalisation nouns which mean ‘an instrument for “verbing”’ are
derived. In addition to these three types of nominalisation processes, two more can be
identified: ‘noun-to-noun’ nominalisation (Comrie & Thompson 1985:395) and ‘adverb-to-
noun’ nominalisation.
   What all these processes have in common is that nominalisation is effected by prefixing
po ‘thing’ to a following verb form or noun. In this process, po functions as a nominaliser,
and will appear as po- in the texts and glossed as NOM. This is done to distinguish
nominalised forms from homophonous forms that constitute clauses (see (176)–(178)
below). Nominalised forms conform to the criterion for word-hood in that they cannot be
broken up by a pause without rendering the utterance ungrammatical or changing the
meaning of the utterance. In this section I will only discuss lexical nominalisation, and
                                                                                        Word classes       91mention clausal nominalisation in passing, to illustrate my point. Clausal nominalisation,
that is relativisation, will be treated in detail in §6.7.
    In objective and instrumental nominalisation po- is prefixed to a bare verb stem. Via
objective nominalisation, nouns are formed which mean ‘a thing we “verb”’. It is the
first/second person plural verb stem that is used in this type of nominalisation, as
illustrated in (168) and (169). Some examples:
(167)       po-kah
            NOM-burn
            ‘garden’ (lit. ‘thing we burn’)
(168)       po-iit
            NOM-eat.P
            ‘food’ (lit. ‘thing we eat’)
(169)       po-kuo
            NOM-feast.P
            ‘feast’ (lit. ‘thing we feast’)
(170)       po-hren
            NOM-sit
            ‘chair’ (lit. ‘thing we sit (on)’)
   I assume that the form in (171) is also an instance of objective nominalisation, although
the putative verbal form *mna ‘tell tale’ is unattested in the data:
(171)       po-mna
            NOM-tell.tale
            ‘tale’
   In instrumental nominalisation, the resulting noun means ‘an instrument for “verbing”’
(see Comrie & Thompson 1985:353). An example follows:
(172)       po-kom
            NOM-write
            ‘pen’ (lit. ‘instrument for writing’)
   In agentive nominalisation, nouns meaning ‘a thing which “verbs”’ are derived from
verbs. These verbs take a third person unmarked person prefix, except when they cannot do
so due to morphophonological constraints. Some examples follow:
(173)       po-m-haf
                                 25
            NOM-3U-pregnant
            ‘pumpkin’ (lit. ‘thing that is pregnant’)
(174)       po-m-afit
            NOM-3U-bite
            ‘mosquito’ (lit. ‘thing that bites’)
(175)       po-ø-safom
            NOM-ø-green
            ‘grass’ (lit. ‘thing that is green’)
25
     The form -haf has two functions: as an inalienably possessed noun it means ‘belly’, and as a verb it means
     ‘pregnant’. The two forms are arguably related.
92      Chapter 4   It could be argued that forms like (173)–(175) are clausal nominalisations rather than
lexical nominalisations, since the verbal form can also function as a minimal clause.
However, there are a number of arguments against this: first, the forms in (173)–(175) are
formally similar to instrumental and objective nominalisations in that they take a prefix
po-. Secondly, these forms are phonologically words: they cannot be interrupted by a pause
without changing the meaning of the utterance. In (176)–(178) the verbal form functions
predicatively, and po functions as the subject of the clause.
(176)     po / m-haf
          thing 3U-pregnant
          ‘The thing is pregnant.’
(177)     po / m-afit
          thing 3U-bite
          ‘The thing bites.’
(178)     po / ø-safom
          thing ø-green
          ‘The thing is green.’
   On the basis of the structural similarity to other types of nominalisation, that is the
presence of the prefix po-, and the fact that a pause cannot be inserted in these forms
without changing their meaning, I conclude that (173)–(175) are instances of lexical
nominalisation, and not clausal nominalisation.
   In (179) and (180) examples of so-called ‘noun to noun’ nominalisation (Comrie &
Thompson 1985:395–397) are given. In this type of nominalisation, a noun takes a prefix
po- in the same way as the verbal form in (167)–(175). The resulting form means ‘thing of
“noun”’. Some examples follow:
(179)     po-hoho
          NOM-plain
          ‘cassowary’
(180)     po-m-ata
          NOM-3U-leaf
          ‘pandan leaf’
   An alternative solution for forms like (179) and (180) would be to analyse them as noun
compounds (see the following section): formally they consist of two juxtaposed nouns, and
semantically they are similar to noun compounds because a form is created which can be
interpreted as ‘a kind of N1’, where N1 is po ‘thing’. However, the process which creates a
form like that in (179) and (180) is formally analogous to the other types of nominalisation
discussed in this section, where the element po- is crucial. Therefore, I will consider forms
like ‘po-noun’ to be nominalisations.
   In (181) ti (<mti ‘night’) takes a prefix po to derive the form po-ti ‘firefly’. Literally,
po-ti can be interpreted as ‘thing of the night’. This makes it semantically similar to ‘noun
to noun’ nominalisation, although mti is formally a temporal adverb (see §4.7.1). It may
seem odd that a noun is derived from an adverb, but (many) temporal adverbs are names
used to refer to time, and they can be used in an NP, for instance rapu knu re-f-o <morning
ø-dark location.SPEC-very.near-U> ‘this early morning’.
                                                                             Word classes   93(181)        po-ti
             NOM-night
             ‘firefly’
4.3.5 Compound nouns
    The term compound noun is used to refer to forms which are composed of two words
from major word classes which together function as a noun. In Maybrat, a distinction can
be made between two types of compound noun, namely N + N and N + V. In this section, I
will first discuss the phonological characteristics of these two types of compound noun.
Subsequently, I will consider some formal aspects of each type of compound noun.
Because some types of compound noun are formally similar to possessive constructions,
NPs consisting of a head plus modifiers, or clauses, it will appear that both syntactic and
semantic criteria are needed to differentiate between the different types of constituents.
    Phonologically, compound nouns constitute a single word, because they do not allow a
pause between the two members of the compound without reducing the meaning of the
compound to that of its individual members. For example, aya kre ‘tributary’ (< aya
‘water’, ø-kre ‘branch’) will come to mean ‘water, branch’ if a pause is inserted. The
stressed syllables in compound nouns are those syllables which would be stressed in each
individual member if uttered in isolation, with the main stress being on the second
member, and the secondary stress on the stressed syllable on the first member, as in (182).
If this results in two adjacent stressed syllables, the stress on the first member is moved
one syllable to the left, if possible. This is illustrated in (183), where the stress, which is
normally on the second syllable of apit ‘banana’26 has moved to the first syllable.
Compound nouns with more than two stressed syllables are unattested. Some examples (in
the remainder of this description, compound nouns are separated by a single space in the
text, and enclosed between braces in the glosses):
(182)        «fane »rapuoh
             {pig forest}
             ‘wild pig’
(183)        «apit »kek
             {banana red}
             k.o. banana
   Compound nouns cannot be broken up by, for instance, the possessive marker ro: in
some cases this yields a meaningless or ungrammatical utterance, as in (184) and (185)
respectively, and in others it changes the meaning of the expression, as in (186a) and
(187a):
(184)         *ara ro-sasu
              tree POSS-sweet.potato
(185)         *apit ro-kek
               banana POSS-red26
     Apit is an exception to the general stress pattern (see also §2.4.1).
94      Chapter 4(186) a.      kau ro-tapam
              rat POSS-land
              ‘rat of the ground’
        b.    kau tapam
              {rat land}
              ‘bandicoot’ (a k.o. rat)
(187) a.      fane ro-rapuoh
              pig POSS-forest
              ‘pig of the forest’
        b.    fane rapuoh
              {pig forest}
              ‘wild pig’
   Semantically, in all compound nouns, the second member modifies the first. For
example, in compounds of the form N1 + N2, the resulting noun is ‘a kind of N1’.
   Some examples of N+N compounds appear below:
(188)        aya kre         ‘tributary’             (< aya ‘water’ + ø-kre ‘branch’)
             fane samu       ‘domesticated pig’      (< fane ‘pig’ + samu ‘house’27)
             fra awiah       ‘chalk’                 (< fra ‘stone’ + awiah ‘taro’)
             apan payir       k.o. snake             (< apan ‘snake’ + payir ‘rainbow’)
   Many names for plants and animals are formally compound nouns of the form N+N. In
these compounds, N1 is the generic term, and N2 is the specifier. Cross-linguistically, the
use of compounds for specific terms of a generic level term is well-attested (Croft
1990:183). Some examples are:
(189)        ara ataf        ‘Intsia bijuga (ironwood tree)’   (< ataf ‘iron’)
             ara atu         ‘Conandrium polyantrum’           (< atu ‘mountain’)
             ara awiah       ‘Gymnostoma sumatranum’           (< awiah ‘taro’)
             ara fra         ‘Dubouzetia galorei’              (< fra ‘stone’)
             ara mawus       ‘Agathis labillardieri’
             ara ki          ‘Syzygium aquea’28
             ara pawiah      ‘nutmeg tree’                     (< pawiah ‘nutmeg’)
             ara sasu        ‘Manihot esculenta’               (< sasu ‘sweet potato’)
             ara nawe        ‘Artocarpus altilis’              (< nawe ‘breadfruit’)
             ara sah         ‘Pometia pinnata’29
   N+N compound nouns where the first member is an inalienably possessed noun are
unattested. Two examples of compound nouns where the second member is formally an
inalienably possessed noun appear in (190a) and (191a). Both are names for a kind of
banana. Like in other compound nouns, the second member modifies the first member.
These forms seem similar to the constructions in (190b) and (191b). However, the latter are

   although *fane amah ‘domesticated pig’ is not used.

Apart from the fact that these b-forms are semantically different from the noun-
compounds, they are formally different as well: the b-forms allow insertion of a pause, and
the order of constituents is modifier-head, as opposed to head-modifier in the a-forms.
(190) a.      apit yatem                   b.    fane y-atem
              {banana yatem}                     pig 3M-arm
              ‘“yatem” banana’                   ‘pig’s arm’

              {banana wai}                       pig ø-tooth
              ‘Musa sp.’                         ‘pig’s tooth’
     In N + V compounds, the V does not always take a person prefix, as illustrated in (192).
(192)         apit kek         k.o. banana (red)                    (< apit ‘banana’; -kek ‘red’)
              apan poh         k.o. snake (white)                   (< apan ‘snake’; -poh ‘white’)
              a poh            k.o. rattan (light in colour)        (< a ‘rattan’; -poh ‘white’)
   The lack of a person prefix on the verb makes this type of compound noun formally
different from NPs in which the V functions as a verbal modifier of a head noun (193a), or
where the V functions as a predicate, as in (193b).30

              ‘The banana is already red.’
     Consider the following forms, where the V takes a covert person prefix:

              ‘The tree is already yellow.’
    Although there is no clear phonological difference between the compound noun (194a)
and forms where the verb functions attributively (194b) or predicatively (194c), a
difference can be made. Unlike in compound nouns, in forms where the verb functions
attributively, the noun and the verb can be separated by a pause without changing the
meaning of the utterance. Inserting a pause between the noun and the verb in a compound
noun results in a change of meaning, as illustrated in (195):30
     The form ara m-kek to refer to ‘antidesma sp.’ is attested, Thus, the terms ara kek and ara m-kek seem to
     refer to the same type of tree.
96      Chapter 4(195) a.      ara fiyaf      re-f-o

              tree      ø-yellow location.SPEC-near-U

     Some more examples of this type of compound noun:
(196)        ara kat          ‘aceratium sp.’                          (< ara ‘tree’; kat ‘dry’31)
             ara knu          ‘annesijoa novoguineensis sp.’           (< ara ‘tree’; knu ‘dark’)
             koh safe         ‘diospyros sp.’                          (< safe ‘black’)
             krere fiyaf      ‘mesua sp.’                              (< fiyaf ‘yellow’)32
    Two forms that seem compound nouns, but of which the second member is unattested in
isolation, are given in (197a) and (198a) below. These forms can be broken up by ro, as
illustrated in the corresponding b-varieties, although it is unclear whether ro here should be
analysed as a possessive marker or as a relative clause marker.33 Likewise, it is not clear
what the difference in meaning between the a- and b-forms below is. Alternatively, sme
and ano could be analysed as adjectival forms, but then the lack of a person prefix on the
form ano cannot be accounted for. Possibly, the forms in (197) and (198) are idioms.34
(197) a.      rae    sme                   b.   rae    ro       sme
              person male                       person POSS/REL male
              ‘man’                             ‘man’
(198) a.      fnia   ano                   b.   fnia   ro      ano
              woman female                      woman POSS/REL female
              ‘woman’                           ‘woman’4.4 Demonstratives
   All demonstratives forms in Maybrat are morphologically complex. The demonstratives
constitute a speaker-oriented system: the base in each form refers to physical distance
away from the speaker. A distinction is made between three distances (the results in this
section have also been described in Dol (1998)):
(199)        -f-    ‘very.near’
             -t-    ‘near’
             -n-    ‘far’
31
   Kat ‘dry’ is formally a verb. It can, however, not receive a person prefix, despite the fact that it contains
   only one syllable. See viz. §3.1.3 for more similar exceptions.
32
   Koh and krere both seem generic names, as there are many examples of plant names including these
   elements in the botanists’ lists. However, I have not been able to trace their meaning.
33
   The possessive marker and relative clause marker are homophonous (see §5.4).
34
   For the sake of consistency in this work I will gloss the forms ro sme and ro ano as ‘REL sme’ and ‘REL
   ano’ respectively, although this choice is arbitrary: given the examples in (197) and (198), ‘POSS-sme’ and
   ‘POSS-ano’ would be justifiable glosses as well.
                                                                                     Word classes       97   The actual physical distances that these forms refer to are as follows: -f- ‘very near’
refers to something which is very near to the speaker, that is something he can actually
touch. Objects that are a little further away, but still within reach, are referred to with the
base -t- ‘near’. The form -n- ‘far’ is used to indicate objects that are far away from the
speaker. The distances referred to by -t- and -n- are relative: if two objects are both far
away, -n- applies to the object that is farthest away, and -t- to the one nearer. The form -f-
however, only applies to objects that are within physical reach of the speaker.
   A fourth form, -au is unmarked for distance: it is used when the actual distance away
from the speaker is irrelevant. The form -au can be adequately translated as ‘there’. The
demonstrative form au is homophonous to the third person singular pronoun au ‘she’.
Given that generally third person pronouns and demonstratives are often related to each
other (see Greenberg 1985:271), it is possible that the demonstrative -au and the free
pronoun au ‘she’ have a common origin. The same is true for the masculine suffix -ait and
the third person masculine free pronoun ait ‘he’, as in (206a). These two forms may be
related to each other.35
   Some contrasts featuring forms which include the demonstrative bases are given in
(200)–(203). The prefix re- and suffix -o in these forms will be discussed later:
(200)       po-kom       re-f-o                            (the pen is held or touched)
            NOM-write location.SPEC-very.near-U
            ‘this pen very near’
(201)       po-kom       re-t-o                            (the pen is within reach)
            NOM-write location.SPEC-near-U
            ‘this pen near’
(202)       po-kom       ro-n-o                            (the pen is out of reach)
            NOM-write location.SPEC-far-U
            ‘that pen far’
(203)       po-kom       re-au                             (the pen can be anywhere)
            NOM-write    location.SPEC-U.DIST
            ‘that pen (unspecified for distance)’
35
     One informant insisted that the demonstrative form was -ao and the pronominal form au, so that the two
     contrasted. I have, however, not been able to verify this contrast.

the demonstrative forms. If a form is unattested, and is not expected to exist, a cell in a
table is left empty. If a form is expected to exist but unattested in the data, a note has been
made.
   In (204), on the horizontal axis, I have given the demonstrative bases as well as the
suffixes. There are three masculine suffixes, namely -i/-ait/-e: -ait and -e specifically
combine with the bases -t- and -n- respectively. Hence, the form *re-f-ait, for instance, is
unacceptable. The suffix -i can combine with both the bases -f- and -t-. Of the masculine36
   The form t-a, a dialectal form originally from the area to the north of Ayawasi, is also used in Ayawasi.
   Some of the examples in this description contain this form.
37
   These forms are discussed in §4.5.
38
   These forms are discussed in §4.8.1 and §4.8.2.
39
   In fact, many of the forms analysed as attributive adverbials could also be analysed as adverbials, so that,
   for instance fai re-t-o would mean ‘the woman here’, and not ‘this woman’. However, their occurrence in
   NPs, as opposed to the ‘adverbial’ forms, as well as the fact that these forms cannot modify a clause, are
   arguments to view them as attributive forms rather than adverbial ones.
40
   The form ti-t-o is unattested in the data. A possible explanation for this is that normally only two sides,
   e.g. of a river, are relevant.
41
   The form po-n-o is unattested in Ayawasi. I recorded it in Kokas, a village situated approximately
   8 kilometres to the south of Ayawasi. The form pe-au is unattested.
42
   The forms to-t-o and wo-t-o are unattested in the data.
                                                                              Word classes      99suffixes, -ait is isomorphous with the free form of the third person masculine pronoun ait
‘he’. These suffixes are used in the same way as person prefixes, namely according to
natural gender. This gender distinction is only relevant for the choice of suffix if the
demonstrative functions as a modifier to a noun and refers to a specific item (that is in
combination with the demonstrative prefix re-), and in the ‘presentative’ and with a fi-
‘similar.to’ prefix, but only if the demonstrative base is -t-. In all other cases the suffix -o is
used. Some examples in which masculine and unmarked forms are contrasted:
(205) a.   rae re-f-i
           man location.SPEC-very.near-3M
           ‘this man very near’
      b.   fai     re-f-o
           woman location.SPEC-very.near-U
           ‘this woman very near’
(206) a.   rae re-t-ait
           man location.SPEC-near-3M
           ‘this man’
      b.   fai     re-t-o
           woman location.SPEC-near-U
           ‘this woman’
(207) a.   rae re-n-e
           man location.SPEC-far-3M
           ‘that man’
      b.   fai     ro-n-o
           woman location.SPEC-far-U
           ‘that woman’
   On the vertical axis in Table 1 (example 204) I have indicated the demonstrative
prefixes. Phonologically, these prefixes (with the exception of the fi- and ti- -forms)
normally have the form /Ce/, unless the demonstrative base is -n-: then the form of the
prefix is /Co/. Three exceptions are pe-n-o, m-n-o, and the masculine form re-n-e.
   In the demonstrative forms a distinction can be made between demonstratives that
function attributively, namely those carrying a prefix re-, we-, te- or ti-, and demonstratives
that function adverbially, namely those with a prefix pe-, me- or fi-. A contrast between
two demonstrative forms that both refer to area, te- and pe-, is given in (208) and (209): in
the forms with te- the demonstrative functions attributively and in the forms with pe- it
functions adverbially:
(208) a.   amah te-t-o
           house area.N-near-U
           ‘the house near here’
      b.   y-tien    pe-t-o
           3M-sleep area.ADV-near-U
           ‘He sleeps near here.’
(209) a.   amah to-n-o
           house area.N-far-U
           ‘that house there (far)’
100       Chapter 4         b.    y-tien    po-n-o
               3M-sleep area.ADV-far-U
               ‘He sleeps there (far).’
   The form in (210) is ungrammatical, because a demonstrative with a prefix pe- cannot
be used attributively:
(210)         *amah pe-f-o
              house area.ADV-very.near-U
   In the remainder of this section, I will first describe the attributive demonstrative forms,
followed by the adverbial demonstrative forms.","[108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118]"
"6.8.4 Focus
   In the focus periphery the intensity or the focus of an event is expressed. The only
elements that can fill the focus periphery are the three focus adverbs that were introduced
in §4.7.6, namely suek ‘immediately, straight away’, iye ‘too’ and si ‘also’. Of these, suek
usually occurs in clause-final position:
(126)       y-ros     y-eyam tapak suek
            3M-stand 3M-roll tobacco immediately
            ‘He stands and immediately rolls tobacco.’
(127)       y-ape         ku     sme suek              sai tipuo
            3M-give.birth child male straight.away just immediately
            ‘He immediately gives birth to only boys.’
(128)       tfe       ø-yoh     u      suek
            crocodile ø-give.up again immediately
            ‘The crocodile immediately gives it up again.’
   The focus adverb iye can occur in clause-final position, but it can also precede the
object, as illustrated in example (129). The difference between these two forms lies in the
scope of iye, and is similar to the difference illustrated in (96) with the aspect adverb: in
(129a) the emphasis is on the ‘cutting’, as opposed to (129b), where the emphasis is on the
‘nutmeg tree’.
(129) a.      y-fat    iye ara pawiah
              3M-fell too {nutmeg tree}
              ‘He fells the nutmeg tree as well.’
17
     M-aku may also refer to ‘daughter’ (see Appendix IV).
162       Chapter 6         b.    y-fat    ara pawiah      iye
               3m-fell {nutmeg tree} too
               ‘He fells the nutmeg tree as well.’
   In example (130), there are two instances of iye: in the first it precedes the object amah
ro ari, and in the second it follows the verb in the nominalised clause ro twok iye.
(130)         ø-skie iye amah ro ari18 ro ø-twok iye
              ø-build too house REL pray REL ø-enter too
              ‘He also builds the church, that we also enter.’
   In example (131a), which is very marked, the aspect adverbial precedes the predicate.
This example is taken from a narrative. When I checked it in isolation, it was unacceptable
according to the informant. This may be attributed to the fact that I contrasted this form
with (131b), which is unmarked. This may have confused the informant.
(131) a.       pi   ait iye, y-hai
               man 3M too 3M-die
               ‘The man too, he dies.’
         b.    pi   ait y-hai iye
               man 3M 3M-die too
               ‘The man died too.’
   The focus adverb si can function as an adverbial in clause-final position, as in examples
(132) and (133), or preceding the object in a clause, as in (134) and (135):
(132)         ku     ait y-he      aya m-aut       si
              child 3M 3M-see water 3U-climb also
              ‘The child sees the water rise too.’
(133)         rae    sme y-men        si
              person male 3M-marry also
              ‘The man also marries.’
(134)         pi   ait y-po        si    au m-atem
              man 3M 3M-hold also 3U 3U-hand
              ‘The man, he also holds her hand.’
(135)         ø-skie si     akah u faut
              ø-build also above up hilltop
              ‘They also build on top of the hill.’
(136)         t-awe m-ama         Pastor y-awe        si
              1S-say 3U-come Father 3M-say also
              ‘I think they are coming, the Father thinks it too.’
   In examples (137) and (138) the function of si is to focus the attention of the listener on
the utterance described in the clause, to indicate that something happens that is contrary to
what is expected. For instance, in (137), it is expected that a group of people stay together.
Instead, it appears that the group goes, but that two people stay behind.

     Ari is possibly a loan from Indonesian hari ‘day’. It is not clear why the word-initial h is not rendered as
     [x], as it usually is.

             Y-amo si       y-amo si
             3M-go also 3M-go also
             ‘His wife went and drank poison, and he did not want to bury her.
             Instead, he ran far away.’
   In example (139) si occurs twice: once in each clause. This makes explicit that the
events described in each clause take place simultaneously. This is a coordinating
construction. More examples are given in §9.1.6.
(139)        anu n-mo si, amu p-mo si
             2P 2P-go.P also 1P 1P-go.P also
             ‘You go, and we go too.’ (implication: everyone goes on the same trip)
   The form ae (see §4.12) can function as a focus adverbial. It invariably occurs in clause-
final position:
(140)        anu p-not      anu ae         sai fe       a
             1P 1P-think 1P indeed just NEG INT
             ‘We indeed only think of ourselves, right?’6.8.5 Combinations of peripheries
   The different types of adverbials discussed in §6.8.2–§6.8.4, that is the adverbials that
predominantly occur in clause-final position, can also be combined. If adverbials are
combined, then the scope of the adverbial that occupies the clause-final position is over the
entire clause, including the other adverbial. The scope of the pre-final adverbial does not
include the final adverbial. A contrast is given in the following example (141):
(141) a.      ait y-no     rere       u
              3M 3M-do carefully again
              ‘He carefully does it again.’
        b.    ait y-no      u       rere
              3M 3M-do again carefully
              ‘He does it again, carefully.’
   Combinations of more than two adverbials are uncommon — although an example with
three different types of adverbial is given in (127) —a nd aspect adverbials appear to
combine more easily with manner adverbials and focus adverbials than manner and focus

164    Chapter 6adverbials with each other. Some examples in which an aspect adverbial is followed by a
another adverbial are:
aspect-manner:
(142) y-no      u       fi-t-o
        3M-do again like-near-U
        ‘He does it again, like this.’
aspect-focus:
(143) au m-ama tna fares iye
         3U 3U-come new still too
         ‘She also came very recently.’ (lit. ‘She came, it is still recent too.’)
  Following are some examples where the aspect adverbial is preceded by another type of
adverbial — (144) and (145), or where an aspect adverbial does not feature (146):
manner-aspect:
(144) y-tien      fi-t-o        sai
       3M-sleep like-near-U just
       ‘He just sleeps like this.’
focus-aspect:
(145) p-oa              iye fares
        1P-not.know too still
        ‘We still don’t know either.’
manner-focus:
(146) amah m-api mimo si
        house 3U-big very also
        ‘The house is also very big.’6.8.6 Location
   In the location periphery, the question of ‘where’ or ‘in what direction’ an event takes
place is answered. The location periphery occurs in clause-final position.
   In §4.8, I discussed forms that refer to location. These items can occupy the location
periphery in the clause, in which case they function as location adverbials. Others, for
instance nouns that refer to a location, function as nominal objects in the clause. An
example is given in (147) and (148). While the verbs in these clauses are the same, the
objects are different. In (147), the object is nominal. This can be illustrated by extracting
the object, as in (147b): extraction of the object in a single-verb clause is always possible if
the object is nominal (see §6.7). Example (148) is modified by a locative adverb kait
‘near’. Kait cannot be extracted, as illustrated in (148b), because it does not function as a
nominal constituent, but as an adverbial one.
(147) a.   ait y-hu      Ayawasi
           3M 3M-stay Ayawasi
           ‘He lives in Ayawasi.’
                                                                                             The clause       165         b.    Ayawasi ro y-hu         m-of
               Ayawasi REL 3M-stay 3U-good
               ‘Ayawasi where he lives is nice.’
(148) a.       ait y-hu       kait
               3M 3M-stay near
               ‘He lives nearby.’
         b.    *kait ro y-hu     m-of
                near REL 3M-stay 3U-good
   There are a number of items that can refer to location. These items usually follow a
motion or position verb (see also §4.8). Formally, these items are nouns, prepositional
verbs, locative adverbs, adverbial demonstratives, and the locational forms to ‘LOC’ and wo
‘LOC.GEN’ that were discussed in §4.8.1. Nouns that refer to location function as objects in
a clause, as illustrated in example (147). The properties of objects were discussed in §6.4.
Prepositional verbs were introduced in §4.2.3.5. Because prepositional verbs always follow
another verb, resulting in a sequence of verbs, they are further discussed in the chapter on
sequences of verbs.22 The syntactic properties of the remaining forms that refer to location,
namely locative adverbs, demonstratives that can function adverbially, and the locational
forms discussed in §4.8.1, are examined below:
   Locative adverbs were introduced in §4.7.4. I illustrated there that locative adverbs can
occur in the location periphery of a clause by themselves, as in (149), or, with the
exception of e ‘far’, be followed by an NP, as in (150). In example (150), the locative
adverbial functions like a preposition (see §4.8.4). In forms like these, the locative form
and the following NP function as a locative adverbial, and its syntactic behaviour is
analogous to that of kait in (148).
(149)         ait y-apo      u
              3M 3M-be.at above
              ‘He is above.’
(150)         ora     m-hu kait Ayawasi
              garden 3u-stay near Ayawasi
              ‘The garden is near Ayawasi.’
   Other forms that function as locative adverbials are the forms with to and wo. Examples
were given in §4.8. There, I also noted that to can function as a kind of preposition,
optionally occurring between a verb and an NP. The two forms in (151) are equally
acceptable:
(151) a.       t-amo to      ora
               1S-go LOC garden
               ‘I go to the garden.’
         b.    t-amo ora
               1S-go garden
               ‘I go to the garden.’22
     It could be argued that prepositional verbs should in fact be discussed in the location periphery, since their
     verbal character is questionable. However, their clear verbal origin warrants a discussion of these forms in
     the chapter on sequences of verbs.
166      Chapter 6    However, the function of ora in each of the forms in (151) is different: in (151b) ora
functions as the nominal object of the verb. A property of this type of object, as was
illustrated in (147), is that it can be relativised. This does not apply to to ora in (151a), as
illustrated in the two forms in (152), which are unacceptable. In other words, to ora is not a
nominal constituent, but rather an adverbial constituent like kait ‘near’ in (148a) and u
‘above’ in (149).
(152) a.      *ora       ro   t-amo to
               garden    REL 1S-go LOC        b.    *to    ora    ro t-amo
               LOC   garden REL 1S-go
   A common combination of locative adverbials in the location periphery is that of akah
‘above’, followed by the directional u ‘up’, where u creates emphasis. A contrast appears
in example (153). Other combinations of locative adverbials are unattested.
(153) a.      ana m-amo akah u faut
              3P 3U-go above up hilltop
              ‘They go to the very top of the hill.’
        b.    ana m-amo akah faut
              3P 3U-go above hilltop
              ‘They go to the top of the hill.’
   Locative adverbials may be combined with manner, aspect or focus adverbials. As with
other combinations of adverbials, the scope of the clause-final adverbial is over the entire
clause, and the scope of the pre-final adverbial does not include the final adverbial. A
contrast is given in example (154): forms like (154b) do occur, but they are very marked.
(154) a.      ait y-amo to-tis             amah iye
              3M 3M-go LOC-behind house too
              ‘He goes behind the house too.’
              (implication: the other people also go behind the house)
        b.    ait y-amo iye to-tis            amah
              3M 3M-go too LOC-behind house
              ‘He goes too, behind the house.’
              (implication: other people don’t go behind the house)
   Some more examples follow:
(155)        m-sas        ayo sai akah u
             3U-examine sun just above up
             ‘They just examine the sun above.’
(156)        fnia     ana ø-yuwo m-hu akah u oh                   me-au
             woman 3P ø-flee 3U-stay above up already PRESTT-DIST.U
             ‘See, the women flee and they are all the way up there already.’
                                                                                        The clause   1676.9 Negation
   There are two ways to express negation, namely with the clausal negator fe and with its
predicative counterpart m-fe. These negators are discussed in §6.9.1 and §6.9.2. In §6.9.3, I
will illustrate that it is not always possible to make a clear distinction between fe and m-fe.
Section 6.9.4 discusses negation of clauses involving adverbial modifiers. I will show how
the scope of the negator can be influenced by varying the order of the negator and the
adverbial in a clause. Some examples of frequently used combinations of negators and
adverbials, such as fe fares ‘not yet’ and m-fe fi-t-o ‘if this is not the case’ are also
discussed. Finally, in §6.9.5 I will present some other forms which semantically express
negation, namely kayie and peroh.","[179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185]"
"5.1 The regular noun phrase
5.1.1 Head
   The head in an NP is obligatory. It can be a noun, a pronoun, a quantifying verb (see
§5.1.5) or an attributive demonstrative (see §5.1.6). If the head is a pronoun, then there are
restrictions on the modifiers. Some examples of NPs headed by a noun are:
(2)        ru m-api wo-n-o
           bird 3U-big location.GEN-far-U
           ‘the big bird approximately there’
(3)        tfo       m-kek m-aku   s-au
           machete 3U-red 3U-small one-3U
           ‘one small red machete’
(4)        ora       ø-pria t-o
           garden ø-all      near-U
           ‘the entire garden’
   In examples (5)–(6) the head of the NP is semantically a proper noun. NPs which are
headed by a proper noun followed by an adjectival verb are typically nicknames.
(5)        Simon y-apuf       re-t-ait
           Simon 3M-short location.SPEC-near-3M
           ‘that Short Simon’
(6)        Maria m-anes re-au
           Maria 3U-old location.SPEC-DIST.U
           ‘that Old Maria’
      Examples of NPs headed by a free pronoun appear below:
(7)        ait y-api re-t-ait
           3M 3M-big location.SPEC-near-3M
           ‘that big one (man)’
(8)        ana eok ro-n-o
           3P two location.SPEC-far-U
           ‘the two of them there’ (lit. ‘they two there’)
(9)        ana ø-prut
           3P ø-all
           ‘all of them’5.1.2 Verbal modifiers
   In §4.2.2.2 a class of adjectival verbs was presented including some illustrative
examples of NPs where they function attributively. I stipulated that in an NP, adjectival
                                                                                   Noun phrases        129verbs take a person prefix which is coreferent with the head of the NP. Some more
examples follow:
(10)        rae       y-anes re-t-ait
            person 3M-old location.SPEC-near-M
            ‘this old man’
(11)        fnia      m-anes re-t-o
            woman 3U-old location.SPEC-near-U
            ‘this old woman’
    Noun phrases rarely occur with more than one verbal modifier. In examples (12) and
(13) there are two modifiers. The maximum number of verbal modifiers attested in the data
is two. In (13) the head noun is a compound noun. If more verbal modifiers are desired in
an NP, RC constructions are used, as in (14) (see §5.3):
(12)        ku     ø-kiniah m-of       t-o
            child ø-small 3U-nice near-U
            ‘these nice small children’
(13)        ara aut        m-api ø-kapes s-au
            {Albizzia sp.} 3U-big ø-huge one-3U
            ‘one very big “Albizzia sp. tree”’1
(14)        ku     ø-kiniah m-of        ro ø-hifuoh
            child ø-small 3U-good REL ø-diligent
            ‘the good small children that are diligent’
   If there are two modifiers, there is a preferred order: the information that is more
prominent or that expresses a more inherent property of the noun is found closer to the
noun (see Givón 1990:470). Thus, in example (15) (both of which are elicited utterances),
the implication in (15a) is that the tree is yellow of itself (that is ‘yellow’ pertains to a
salient characteristic of tree) and that an added property of the tree is that it is big. This is
precisely the other way around for (15b), where ‘big’ refers to an intrinsic property of the
tree, and an additional feature is that the tree is yellow.2
(15) a.     ara ø-fiyaf      m-api t-o
            tree ø-yellow 3U-big near-U
            ‘the big yellow tree’
       b.   ara m-api ø-fiyaf     t-o
            tree 3U-big ø-yellow near-U
            ‘the yellow big tree’5.1.3 Classifier
  Classifiers may precede a numeral in an NP. Classifiers are used to emphasise the
number of items expressed by the noun head of the NP. Both forms below are acceptable,
and I have not been able to establish a semantic difference between the two:1
    The grated bark of ara aut is heated in fire, and applied to boils to improve healing (Avé 1998:2).
2
    Ara fiyaf can syntactically also be a compound noun (see §4.3.5). Ara fiyaf is claoxyloa sp. or Melicope
    xanthoxyloides (Avé 1998:B8).
130         Chapter 5(16)         fnia     m-ana    ewok re-t-o

             women two location.SPEC-near-U
             ‘these two women’
   In the discussion on inalienably possessed nouns (§4.3.1) I noted that four inalienably
possessed nouns can function as classifiers, namely m-ana ‘its head’; m-akan ‘its seed/
stone’; m-ake ‘its fruit’; and m-ata ‘its leaf’.
   The word m-ana is a general classifier but it is mainly used for human and animate head
nouns. Some examples, see also (16):
(18)         ku     ø-kiniah m-ana tiet
             child ø-small 3U-head four
             ‘four small children’
(19)         fane m-ana  s-au
             pig 3U-head one-3U
             ‘one pig’
   The classifier m-akan is used for seeds and for fruit; m-ake only for fruit and m-ata is
used when counting money (banknotes). Whereas m-ana can be used instead of m-akan or
m-ake, as illustrated in the b-examples below, this is not the case the other way around. As
far as I know, there is no difference in meaning between the ‘a’ and the ‘b’ varieties below.
(20) a.      apit tawe      m-akan s-au
             {banana tawe} 3U-seed one-3U
             ‘one tawe banana’
       b.    apit tawe      m-ana s-au
             {banana tawe} 3U-head one-3U
             ‘one tawe banana’
(21) a.      awiah m-ake   eok
             taro 3U-fruit two
             ‘two taros’
       b.    awiah m-ana eok
             taro 3U-fruit two
             ‘two taros’
    For banknotes, only m-ata ‘leaf’ is used:3
(22)         pitis    m-ata mat
             money 3U-leaf five
             ‘five banknotes’ (lit. ‘five leaves of money’)
   There is person agreement between the head of the NP and the classifier, as illustrated
below. In example (24) the NPs are enclosed in square brackets:3
    For counting coins, the classifier m-akan is used.
                                                                                      Noun phrases        131(23)        amu p-na          tuf
            1P 1P-head.P three
            ‘the three of us’
(24)        [fane m-ana tuf]np m-nan    na       m-ape
            pig 3U-head three 3U-enough and.then 3U-give.birth

            person real LOC.behind 3M-head one-3M child male
            ‘Three pigs and then, lastly, she gave birth to a human, one (man), a boy.’
   Classifiers are never used when counting time, such as years, months or weeks. Thus,
example (26b) is ungrammatical.
(25)        tein              eok
            abandoned.garden4 two
            ‘two years’
(26) a.     hari minggu s-au
            day Sunday one-3U
            ‘one week’
       b.   *hari minggu m-ana s-au
             day Sunday 3U-head one-3U
   The noun yu ‘bag’ can function as a measure noun in the same way as the classifiers
discussed above. Unlike the other classifiers, it cannot be omitted from an NP. It is used to
measure specific amounts of ‘uncountables’, such as rice and salt.
(27)        pasa yu ewok
            rice bag two
            ‘two bags of rice’
(28)        po-kas     yu tuf
            NOM-lick bag three
            ‘three bags of salt’
   Other measure nouns of this type are unattested.
   The noun phrases m-ana tuf in example (29) and m-ata tiet re-t-o in (30) have a nominal
head which is formally an inalienably possessed noun.
(29)        [m-ana tuf] m-ait au
            3U-head three 3U-eat DIST.U
            ‘The three eat there.’
(30)        n-e     [m-ata tiet re-t-o]
            2-give leaf      four location.SPEC-near-U
            ‘Give these four banknotes.’ (lit. ‘Give these four leaves.’)
4
    Formerly, long periods of time were counted in terms of abandoned gardens. Gardens were made, used,
    and, when empty, left for a new garden. This cycle took up approximately a year, referred to as tein. Since
    the Catholic mission and, subsequently, the Indonesian government came, tein has come to mean ‘year’.
132      Chapter 5   Given this, an NP in which a sequence [Classifier Numeral] modifies a head noun, as in
example (31), formally contains an NP within an NP. This illustrates the recursivity of
NPs.5 In a construction like (31), however, the sequence [Classifier Numeral] cannot be
further modified by a demonstrative. In other words, the NP within the NP is restricted
with respect to its expansive capacities.

    In §4.6 the numerals from ‘one’ through to ‘twenty’ were presented. I illustrated that the
terms for ‘one’ to ‘four’ (and in some dialects ‘five’) are unique number terms, and that the
higher numbers are referred to by using terms for hands/fingers and feet/toes until ‘one
man gone’ representing ‘twenty’ is reached. These higher numbers (with the exception of
s-t-atem ‘ten’6) structurally resemble NPs in themselves: they can be headed by the noun
tem (derived from the stem -atem) ‘hand’; krem ‘finger/toe’; or oo ‘foot.PL’, all of which
are stripped of a person prefix,7 and modified by one of the unique number terms. I will
refer to these structures as ‘number phrases’. Some examples follow:
(32)       tem s-au
           hand one-3U
           ‘five’ (lit. ‘one hand’)
(33)       krem          tuf
           finger/toe three
           ‘eight’ (lit. ‘three fingers’)
    For the higher numbers, two juxtaposed number phrases are used.
(34)       [oo]NP [krem        s-au]NP
           foot finger/toe one-3U
           ‘eleven’ (lit. ‘foot, one toe’)
(35)       [oo s-au]NP [krem             tiet]NP
           foot one-3U finger/toe four
           ‘nineteen’ (lit. ‘one foot, four toes’)
5
    Matthews (1981:77) indicates that NPs are often a recursive category.
6
    S-t-atem ‘ten’ consists of a prefix s- ‘one’ and an inalienably possessed noun t-atem ‘my hand’ (see §4.6).
7
    Tem ‘hand’ and oo ‘foot.PL’ may, and usually do, take a person prefix because they consist of only one
    syllable. However, these person prefixes are not present. By analogy I assume that krem ‘finger/toe’,
    which normally takes a covert person prefix, is also stripped of its prefix here. The presence versus the
    absence of this prefix can result in a difference in meaning, hence the prefix is distinctive:
          a. y-ait      oo        ewok                     b. y-ait      n-oo      ewok
               3M-eat foot.PL two                               3M-eat 1-foot.PL two
               ‘He eats twelve (of them).’                      ‘He eats your two feet.’
                                                                                   Noun phrases   133   This whole number phrase or sequence of number phrases can function as a modifier to
a head noun in an NP. Like example (31), (36) illustrates the recursive properties of NPs:
oo and krem s-au function as one number phrase, constituting two juxtaposed number
phrases. This number phrase functions as a numeral in the NP m-ana oo krem s-au. This
NP, in turn, functions as a modifier to the head noun ku in the NP ku m-ana oo krem s-au
re-t-o, which functions as a subject in the clause given in (36):
(36)       5[ku  4[m-ana 3[1[oo]NP1             2[krem     s-au]NP2]NP3]NP4

           location.SPEC-near-U 3U-go school
           ‘These eleven children go to school.’5.1.5 Quantifying verbs
   Quantifying verbs, introduced in §4.2.2.3, follow a head noun and a verbal modifier,
and precede the determiner in an NP. They are unattested in NPs which also contain a
numeral or number phrase. The example below is elicited: quantifying verbs do not
normally appear in large NPs like this.
(37)       rae       m-anes ø-wisau re-t-o
           person 3U-old ø-all      location.SPEC-near-U
           ‘all these old people’
   Unlike adjectival verbs, quantifying verbs can be used as substantives. In examples (38)
and (39) a quantifier occupies the subject position in the clause, and in (40) and (41) the
object position. Quantifying verbs that take the place of an NP cannot be further modified.
(38)       m-siar    m-amo Kumurkek
           3U-many 3U-go Kumurkek
           ‘They all went to Kumurkek.’
(39)       ø-prut m-nan po-ø-safom
           ø-all  3U-like NOM-ø-green
           ‘They were all like grass.’
(40)       n-e     ø-waro sai
           2-give ø-little just
           ‘Give just a little.’
(41)       m-kah ø-pria
           3U-burn ø-everything
           ‘They burned everything.’
   Although quantifiers can take the place of an NP, they are not nominal in character.
While NPs with a noun-head in subject or object position can be extracted through
relativisation,8 as illustrated in example (42), this is not the case for quantifiers that occupy
these positions, cf. (43) and (44).","[146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151]"
"4.2.2.1 Regular intransitive verbs
   The class of regular intransitive verbs includes verbs that can only function
predicatively. This is illustrated in (50) below. Examples of typically intransitive verbs are:
70     Chapter 4(39)      -awe         ‘fall’
          -haf         ‘pregnant’
          -hai         ‘die’
          kron         ‘sound’
          ksie         ‘sneeze’
          -tie         ‘break (sticks)’
   Some of these intransitive verbs can be made transitive by attaching the derivative
prefix -i- TRANS (see §4.2.4).
   Some clauses featuring intransitive verbs are:
(40)      rae y-atiet
          man 3M-perish
          ‘The man perishes.’
(41)      smai tapam m-o
          {bean land}9 3U-grow
          ‘The peanuts grow.’
   An apparent exception in the series of intransitive verbs is the expression -hai awiah ‘to
be hungry’, given in (42).10 The form -hai awiah here suggests that an intransitive verb
receives a nominal object. However, this object is not a regular nominal object, as it cannot
be extracted through relativisation, as illustrated in (43).11 This suggests that the expression
-hai awiah is an idiomatic term which functions as one single syntactic unity.
(42)      y-hai awiah
          3M-die taro
          ‘He is hungry.’
(43)      *awiah ro y-hai m-api
          taro   REL 3M-die 3U-big4.2.2.2 Adjectival verbs
    Adjectival verbs are verbs that can function predicatively in a clause, as well as
attributively in an NP. Semantically, they express typically ‘adjectival’ notions, such as
dimension (‘big’, ‘small’, ‘thick’ etc.), physical property (‘hard’, ‘soft’, ‘heavy’, ‘light’
etc.), colour (‘black’, ‘white’, ‘red’ etc.), value (‘good’, ‘bad’ etc.) (Dixon 1977:31). It is
not unusual for a language to show a convergence between verbal and adjectival notions,
so that both are expressed in one word class, usually that of ‘verb’ (Dixon 1977). Some
examples of adjectival verbs, given in antonym pairs are:
9
   Smai tapam is a compound noun: compound nouns are separated by a single space in the text, and
   enclosed between braces in the glosses (see §4.3.5).
10
   This expression is the only term attested to express hunger, i.e. it does not apply just to a desire to eat
   awiah ‘taro’.
11
   See §6.7 for a discussion on relativisation in clauses.
                                                                                 Word classes      71(44)        -anes        ‘old’     ~       -aku     ‘young’
            -of          ‘good’    ~       -kair    ‘bad’
            kiniah       ‘small’   ~       -api     ‘big’
            -ria         ‘tall’    ~       -apuf    ‘short’
            samuoh       ‘heavy’   ~       yuan     ‘light’
     The class of adjectival verbs incorporates six colour terms:
(45)        -poh          ‘white’ (lit. ‘ashes’)
            safe          ‘black’
            -kek          ‘red’
            fiyaf         ‘yellow’
            safom         ‘green’
            knu           ‘dark’ (used for dark colours, including blue)
   This system of six terms is in accordance with the categorisation of basic colour terms
across languages, as introduced by Berlin and Kay (1969). Berlin and Kay stipulate that
languages make use of eleven basic colour terms, which are hierarchically organised as
follows:
(46)        black    <       red       <    yellow <      blue    <      etc.
            white                           green
   This hierarchy is used to illustrate that if a language has a term X for a colour anywhere
on the hierarchy, then this implies that it also makes use of the terms to the left of term X.
Maybrat has a term to denote ‘blue’ and other dark colours, and it indeed has all the colour
terms for colours to the left of ‘blue’ as well.12
   Syntactically, adjectival verbs can function both predicatively and attributively. The
adjectival verb -api in (47a) functions predicatively. The subject of this clause is fane
re-t-o. Conversely, in (47b) -api functions attributively: it modifies the head noun fane.
fane m-api re-t-o constitutes an NP which functions as the object of the verb fnak ‘stab’.
(47) a.     fane re-t-o              m-api
            pig location.SPEC-near-U 3U-big
            ‘This pig is big.’
       b.   tuo ø-fnak fane m-api re-t-o
            1S ø-stab pig 3U-big location.SPEC-near-U
            ‘I stab this big pig.’
   Adjectival verbs that are used attributively receive a person prefix that is coreferent with
the head of the NP:
(48)        pi     y-anes re-t-o
            man 3M-old location.SPEC-near-U
            ‘that old man’
(49)        ku      m-of      re-f-o
            child 3U-good location.SPEC-very.near-U
            ‘this good child’12
     See also Foley (1997:152–159) for a discussion on colour categorisation and types of basic colour
     terminologies.
72      Chapter 4   With the exception of some quantifying verbs, none of the other verb classes contain
verbs that can be used attributively. An illustration is given below. In (50a) -asah ‘laugh’ is
used predicatively. The same verb cannot be used attributively in an NP, as illustrated in
(50b).
(50) a.     fai     re-t-o             m-asah
            woman location.SPEC-near-U 3U-laugh
            ‘This woman laughs.’
       b.   *t-kai   fai   m-asah re-t-o
             1S-meet woman 3U-laugh location.SPEC-near-U
    The fact that the ‘adjectival’ verbs can function attributively in an NP (see §5.1.2) could
be used as an argument to introduce a separate word class ‘adjective’ for Maybrat.
However, this is undesirable because the adjectival verbs retain all the formal
morphological properties of verbs, whether they function predicatively, as in (47a), or
attributively, as in (47b). In addition, the ability to function predicatively is a function
typically associated with verbs. Introducing a separate category ‘adjective’ would conceal
this morphological and functional similarity between verbs and adjectives.","[87, 88, 89, 90]"

     Both of these databases were developed by members of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL).
                                                                           Introduction   13   During the time I stayed in Ayawasi, a number of other researchers from the ISIR
project lived there for shorter or longer periods as well. I worked together closely with Avé
(ethnobotany), and we sometimes collected data together. Polak (botany), Avé and I also
assisted each other with the translations and interpretations of names of plants that the
botanists had collected, and we regularly interpreted other data we received together. Odé
visited in order to assist me in the analysis of a phonetic problem (see §2.1.3, footnote20
and §3.1.3, footnote3).
   The present book aims to give an overview of the phonology, morphology and syntax of
the Maybrat language as it is spoken by the people of Ayawasi. Ideally, this work can be
used as a reference grammar: it gives information about the most important structural and
typological aspects of Maybrat. With this in mind, the grammar is full of illustrative
examples centred around contrasts in form and meaning, which are discussed in the text.
The work, which is mainly descriptive, draws on insights formulated by Dik (1987, 1997),
Givón (1984, 1990) and Shopen (1985). Many ideas for the description come from
typological work by Foley (1986), Comrie (1989), Croft (1990) and Hopper and Traugott
(1993). The terminology is kept as neutral as possible: less traditional terms are clearly
defined before they are used.
2                 Phonology    In this chapter I will give an account of the sound-pattern of Maybrat. In §2.1 I will
begin with a description of the vowels (§2.1.1) and the consonants (§2.1.2), including
allophones and lists of contrasts.
    Section 2.2, on phonotactics, gives sequences of vowels and consonants that occur in
mono- and poly-morphemic forms. In §2.3, a description of syllable and word structure is
given. The epenthetic vowel schwa ([´]) is discussed in §2.3.2. In §2.4 stress is treated.
First, I will illustrate how stress works on the word level, followed by stress in connected
speech. Subsequently, in §2.5 some other phonetic features are described. In §2.6 some
elliptic phenomena that occur in ‘allegro’ speech are illustrated. In §2.7, I will examine
intonation in connected speech and finally, in §2.8, I will illustrate how foreign sounds are
adapted in Maybrat.
    Before starting the description of the sound-pattern of Maybrat, it is appropriate to make
a note about the glosses that are given for verbs and inalienably possessed nouns. With the
exception of adverbial verbs (see §8.2), all verbs take an obligatory person prefix, which is
either overt (phonologically expressed) or covert (not phonologically expressed). Verbs
typically function as predicates, and are therefore glossed as such. Examples of verbs that
take an overt person prefix are /t-amo/ ‘I go’; /y-nit/ ‘He tells’. Verbs that take a third
person unmarked person prefix /m-/ (‘3U’) are translated as ‘she’, ‘they’ or ‘it’ for example
/m-ama/ ‘She comes’; /m-xaf/ ‘She is pregnant’; /m-kias/ ‘They tell’; /m-tie/ ‘It breaks’.
Verbs that take a covert person prefix are also glossed as ‘she’, ‘they’ or ‘it’, that is
/ø-saso/ ‘she searches’; /ø-kiam/ ‘They are ill’; /ø-ptek/ ‘It falls’. In these examples, ‘ø’
marks a covert person prefix (see §3.1.2). Likewise, inalienably possessed nouns, which
take the same prefixes as verbs, with an /m-/ prefix are translated as ‘her’, ‘their’ or ‘its’,
for example /m-na/ ‘her head’; /m-atia/ ‘their father’; /m-aim/ ‘its wing’.1
    In the examples in this chapter I have not given morpheme boundaries, because they are
irrelevant for the present discussion.","[30, 31, 32]"

   The sequence fares fe is unattested in the texts, but it is theoretically possible, as illustrated below:
        a. ku     m-ait po-iit          fe     fares            b. ku        m-ait po-iit           fares fe

           ‘The child has not eaten yet.’                            ‘The child is not still eating.’
     Although a form like b. above can be given an interpretation, it is a very ‘tortured’ sentence. A more
   natural way to express that a child is no longer eating is given below:
        c. ku     m-ait po-iit          oh
           child 3U-eat thing-eat.P already
           ‘The child has already eaten.’

   Ara hri is a possessive construction of the type possessor-possessed. Hri ‘bark’, an attribute of ara ‘tree’
   is an inalienably possessed noun. See also §4.3.1.
174     Chapter 66.9.5 Other semantic negatives
   The negators peroh ‘wrong’ and kayie ‘it is not’, introduced in §4.7.5, can semantically
negate an assertion. In the following examples, kayie ‘negates’ an NP. Intonationally, it
belongs to the NP, and it is followed by a pause:
(195)     Koru kayiè / m-tut m-ama m-hu fte tuoh Pamai
          Koru not          3U-all 3U-come 3U-stay area place Pamai
          ‘It was not Koru (where they went), they all came and lived at an area
          of the place Pamai.’
(196)     Anton kayiè / Atafonit m-anes                  p-awiya33 m-hai ete
          Anton not     Atafonit 3U-old                  thing-who 3U-die below

          ‘Not Anton, Atafonit, the old one, is the one who died at the foot of the
          ironwood tree.’
   The negator peroh is preceded by sentence-final intonation of the previous sentence and
a pause, and followed by yet another pause. Syntactically then, it is an interjection.34 The
assertion that precedes peroh is the one that is denied. Some examples appear below. As
indicated, in example (197), the speakers of each sentence are different people, that is, the
speaker of the second sentence corrects the speaker of the first sentence.

                                                                               The clause     1756.10 Clausal determiner
   The form fo (but not to and no) can function as a clausal determiner. In this function, it
marks the clause boundary. A clausal determiner makes the clause more ‘definite’: it
becomes a ‘given’ in the discourse and draws attention to the clause. The clausal
determiner fo is glossed as ‘DET’.
   The identification of a clausal determiner is somewhat problematic. Clausal determiners
occur strictly in clause-final position, and they are usually left untranslated. They can be
defined negatively: they are not attributive demonstratives, aspect adverbials or anaphoric
referents.
   An example involving a clausal determiner appears in (200). This sentence, taken from
a narrative ‘sets the stage’ for the rest of the narrative. It is important that the listener picks
up the information in the clause, and it is therefore marked with fo.
(200)    na pi         ait ø-tutu fò     /
         then man 3M ø-chase DET
         ‘It is given that then the man chases.’
   The distinction between fo as a clausal determiner and fo as an aspect adverbial (see
§6.8.3) is fuzzy, as both occur in clause-final position. Theoretically, the two forms can co-
occur, as indicated in example (201), but forms like these are unattested in natural speech.
The clausal determiner invariably occurs clause-finally.
(201)    ku       ø-kiniah y-tien        fo       fò     /
         child ø-small 3M-sleep INCEPT DET
         ‘It is given that the child is falling asleep.’
   More examples of fo as a clausal determiner appear below:
(202)    ait y-aut         fò    / y-amo ara m-apuo akàh               /
         3M 3M-climb DET            3M-go tree 3U-top above
         ‘It is given that he climbs, he goes to the top of the tree.’
(203)    n-ma     ø-sròt   / ke     om m-ais        rpi-rpa
         2-come.P ø-quickly because rain 3U-descend droplet-REDUP
         m-ase     fò    /
         seriously DET
         ‘Come quickly because it is given that it will rain cats and dogs.’6.11 Anaphoric reference
   So far, I have discussed demonstratives in several different functions, namely as
determiners in an NP (§5.1.6), as temporal adverbials (§6.8.1), as manner adverbials
(§6.8.2) and as location adverbials (§6.8.6). In this section I would like to illustrate the
function of demonstratives as anaphoric referents.
   The demonstrative forms f-o and t-o can function anaphorically to refer to items in the
discourse that are already known. They are particular examples of what Himmelmann
refers to as ‘tracking use’ that is reference to entities that have already been introduced in
the discourse, and which help the listener to keep track of the story (Himmelmann
1996:240). The anaphoric use of deictic elements is common in Papuan languages,
176     Chapter 6although many of these languages seem to use the far deictic (which in Maybrat would be
-n- ‘far’) anaphorically (Reesink 1987:216).
   The sentences in examples (204) and (205) are from a fairy tale. In (204) f-o,
underlined, functions anaphorically, referring back to ku m-ana eok re-f-o ‘these two
children’, which are introduced at the beginning of the example:
(204)    ku m-ana      eok re-f-o                    m-amo ø-sre
         child 3U-head two location.SPEC-very.near-U 3U-go ø-wrong
         m-atu     ø-frok m-ae to-te        fra ø-kron      tapam Mare.
         3U-emerge ø-arrive 3U-at LOC-below {stone ø-sound} land Mare
         M-ana eok f-o                m-per fra ø-kron
         3U-head two very.near-U 3U-step {stone ø-sound}
         ‘These two children go wrong, and they emerge below at the “sounding stone”,
         the land Mare. These two step on the “sounding stone”.’
  In example (205) ana f-o refers to the two women mentioned earlier in the example as
m-ana s-aux ‘the one’ and m-ana s-auy ‘the other’ (both enclosed in square brackets):
(205)    mah rapu     fai   au m-roh       ø-sokuos, [m-ana               s-au]x
         dawn morning woman 3U 3U-descends ø-order 3U-head                one-3U
         m-aso     naf,       [m-ana s-au]y m-kah           po-kah …
         3U-plant taro.shoot 3U-head one-3U 3U-burn thing-burn
         ‘At dawn the following morning the woman descends (from her house) and
         orders, one (woman) plants taro shoots, the other (woman) burns a garden …’
         Ana f-o           m-aso      po, m-kah po         mti     m-tien
         3P very.near-U 3U-plant thing 3U-burn thing night 3U-sleep
         ‘They plant something, they burn something and at night they sleep.’
7                 Mood
   In this chapter I will be concerned with mood, that is the way in which the attitude of
the speaker is expressed. Traditionally, a distinction is made between three basic types of
mood, namely interrogative, imperative and declarative. In the interrogative mood, the
speaker expresses a wish for information. In the imperative mood, the speaker expresses a
command or gives an instruction. The declarative mood can be defined negatively,
that is speech acts that are not interrogative or imperative are declarative (cf. Lyons
1968:307–308).
   So far, the description of Maybrat has centred around simple declarative statements or,
in other words, statements in the indicative mood. In this short chapter, I will discuss two
moods that are grammatically marked, namely the interrogative mood and the imperative
mood. Interrogatives either contain an interrogative marker (polar questions and alternative
questions) or a question word (content questions). Imperatives are characterised by the
presence of an imperative marker re ‘please’ or by a distinct intonation pattern. The form
mai ‘PROHIB’ (prohibitive) marks the prohibitive. Syntactically, statements in the indicative
mood are unmarked.17.1 Interrogative
   A distinction can be made between three types of question, namely polar questions,
alternative questions and content questions. Intonationally, all types of question behave in
the same way as other clauses, that is there is a fall in pitch towards the end of the clause.27.1.1 Polar questions
   Polar questions, or Yes/No questions, are characterised by the presence of the interrogative
marker a in clause-final position. No variations in word order are required. Some examples
are given in (1)–(4). Examples (3)–(4) illustrate that the clausal periphery precedes the
interrogative marker. In each case the scope of the interrogator is the entire clause.","[191, 192, 193, 194, 195]"
"6.9.1 Clausal negator fe
     The clausal negator fe occurs in clause-final position, but see (162). Some examples:
(157)       om m-ais             fe
            rain 3U-descend NEG
            ‘It is not raining.’
(158)       ana m-asah fe
            3P 3U-laugh NEG
            ‘They do not laugh.’
(159)       ait y-amo Kumurkek fe
            3M 3M-go Kumurkek NEG
            1. ‘He does not go to Kumurkek.’
            2. ‘He goes, but not to Kumurkek.’
(160)       ait y-e       pitis  fe
            3M 3M-give money NEG
            1. ‘He does not give money.’
            2. ‘He gives something, but not money.’
    In these examples, the unmarked interpretation is where the verb is negated, that is
reading 1. This is in accordance with the typological pattern of SVO-languages, in which
the negative marker is usually a verbal operator rather than a sentential one (cf. Givón
1984:336). However, an interpretation in which only the object is negated (reading 2) is
also common. If a negated sentence allows more than one interpretation, there are two
ways to resolve this ambiguity: one is to use emphasis, as in example (161), and the other
is to add an extra clause which indicates which constituent is to be negated, as in (162):
(161)       ait y-e       pítis   fe
            3M 3M-give money NEG
            ‘He does not give money (but something else).’
(162)       ana m-e         fe23 ait. M-e        mtah r-ait,         Uris
            3P 3U-give NEG 3M 3U-give dog               POSS-3M Uris
            ‘They do not give anything to him, they give it to his dog Uris.’
23
     This is the only attested instance of a negator preceding an object in a clause.
168     Chapter 6   In principle, these sentences are open to a third interpretation, namely one where the
subject is negated. This interpretation is extremely marked: if it is intended, the subject is
emphasised, and there may be a small pause following the subject.
(163)     Potafit / ait y-apo           fe
          Potafit       3M 3M-eat.meat NEG
          ‘It’s Potafit (and not someone else) who does not eat.’
   In discourse, these potential ambiguities given above normally do not arise. The reason
for this is that the interpretation of negated sentences normally depends on the context in
which they are used (cf. Payne 1985:198). In other words, as long as the context is known,
the interpretation of the negated sentence (that is the scope of the negator in that particular
case) is usually self-evident. For example, in (164) fe negates the clause m-he (ait), where
ait is the object that has been omitted in the sentence because it is already known from the
previous sentence. It is clear that the interpretation of m-he fe should be ‘They don’t see
him’, (that is the scope of the negation is the object of the clause, since the previous
sentence indicates that a group of people is looking for ‘him’). This interpretation is
confirmed in the following sentence m-awe y-e y-amo.
(164)     m-awe y-ama        ø-ste iso. M-he fe.          M-awe y-e          y-amo
          3U-say 3M-come ø-wait road 3U-see NEG 3U-say 3M-return 3M-go
          ‘They think he has come and is waiting on the road. They do not see him.
          They think he has gone back.’
   The negator fe can also be used to create a statement which is semantically strongly
positive. Phonologically, these instances are pronounced at a high pitch, and usually with a
loud voice. Semantically, (165), for example, negates the fact that there is a little, thus
emphasises that there is a lot.24 An example:
(165)     sa m-siar         rere              fe
          fish 3U-many scrupulously NEG
          ‘An awful lot of fish.’ (lit. ‘It’s not a “regular” amount of fish.’)6.9.2 Predicative use
   The negator fe can also function as a verb, in which case it takes a third person
unmarked person prefix. This form, m-fe, can be adequately translated as ‘it is not’. Some
examples follow:
(166)     arko       m-fe,   y-o       ita m-ata25
          firewood 3U-NEG 3M-take leaf leaf
          ‘There is no firewood, he takes leafs.’
24
   Semantically similar constructions also appear in other languages, such as Du. Niet te weinig, lit. ‘not too
   sparingly’, but actually meaning ‘an awful lot’.
25
   The term ita m-ata possibly refers to ‘foliage’.
                                                                                            The clause       169(167)         Isak ait m-fe,26 y-ama          y-ehoh kambing r-ait
              Isak 3M 3U-NEG 3M-come 3M-stab goat                    POSS-3M
              ‘Not Isak, he comes and stabs his goat (instead of stabbing bystanders, like
              the other people who are involved in the dispute which was being narrated).’
   A contrast between fe and m-fe is given in example (168) below. In (168a) fe functions
as a clausal negator, negating the clause y-he. In (168b) m-fe does not negate the verb, but
constitutes a separate proposition.
(168) a.       m-he    ait fe
               3U-see 3M NEG
               ‘She does not see him.’
         b.    m-he ait m-fe
               3U-see 3M 3U-NEG
               ‘She sees that he is not there.’
     A form which is analogous to example (168b) in syntactic structure is given in (169):
(169)         y-he    au m-amo
              3M-see 3U 3U-go
              ‘He sees that she goes.’
   The forms in examples (168b) and (169) are similar in that they are both dominated by a
single intonation contour. These examples constitute one clause: m-fe in (168b) and au
m-amo in (169) function like clausal objects, or complements, to the verb -he.27
   The predicative form m-fe is found in two syntactic environments. First, m-fe often
occurs in sentence-initial position. Here, it makes explicit that the content of the previous
sentence does not apply to the utterance following m-fe. An accurate translation of m-fe in
this position is ‘it/this is not the case’. In terms of intonation, m-fe is preceded by a pause,
and sentence-final intonation, that is a fall in pitch.
(170)         ku    r-ana   m-he   m-arak ... M-fe m-akus
              child POSS-3P 3U-see 3U-empty 3U-NEG 3U-leave.behind
              m-ana       eok m-rof           ø-woum
              3U-head two 3U-follow ø-search
              ‘Their children, they (the women) see that they (the children) are gone ...
              It is not the case that they (the women) leave them (the children), the two
              (women) follow and search.’
(171)         rae    ø-sirus    m-se     rae    sme p-ana.
              person ø-take.off 3U-place person male self-3P
              M-fe    au m-akus
              3U-NEG 3U 3U-leave.behind
              ‘The men take it (i.e. decoration) off (the woman), and they place them
              on the men themselves. This is not the case (for her), she is left behind.’
26
     Recall that there is no agreement between the person prefix of fe and the subject of the clause (§4.7.5).
27
     A full discussion of complements is given in §8.3.
170       Chapter 6(172)       rae    s-ait  y-per      m-ana   eok. M-fe  na28
            person one-3U 3M-educate 3U-head two 3U-NEG and.then
            y-per      m-ana s-au
            3M-educate 3U-head one-3U
            ‘One man educates two (boys). If that is not the case, he educates one (boy).’
   The negator fe is unattested in sentence-initial position in the same function.
   A second context where m-fe frequently occurs is following the verb -he. Example
(168b) is a case in point. Some more examples involving -he m-fe are:
(173)       pae       m-he     m-fe    m-amo
            twosome 3U-see 3U-NEG 3U-go
            ‘The two see it does not work and they go.’
(174)       m-sas        te-au        te-au         m-he     m-fe      m-e

            3U-come again 3U-examine area.N-very.near-U
            ‘They examine the area there and there and they see it does not work and
            they return and come again and they examine the area here.’
(175)       pi   ait y-ama      ø-saso    y-he     m-fe     y-e         u
            man 3M 3M-come ø-search 3M-see 3U-NEG 3M-return again
            ‘The man comes and searches and sees it does not work, and he returns again.’6.9.3 Some problems
   In the previous two sections I created the impression that there is a clear distinction in
both form and function between the clausal negator fe and the predicative m-fe. This
distinction, however, cannot always be maintained, as I will show below.
   To begin with, the clausal negator fe can also negate constituents other than clauses. In
examples (176)–(178) below fe ‘negates’ an NP. The sequence ‘NP fe’ functions like a
verbless clause. Some examples follow:
(176)       trus     y-hu.      Pam fe.      Tfo       fe
            and.then 3M-stay axe NEG machete NEG
            ‘And then he stays. There is no axe, there is no machete.’
(177)       y-nat      fane re-f-o.                  Sten fe.
            3M-examine pig location.SPEC-very.near-U fat NEG
            Sten fe,   m-kair
            fat NEG 3U-bad
            ‘He examines the pig. There is no fat. There is no fat, (so) it is bad.’
(178)       fai        Fasheriem fe
            woman Fasheriem NEG
            ‘It is not the woman Fasheriem.’28
     M-fe is frequently followed by the coordinator na in this position, as in example (172). For a discussion of
     na, see §9.1.1.2.
                                                                                          The clause   171  In examples (166)–(167) I illustrated that the predicative form m-fe can negate an NP.
When elicited, some informants made the following distinction between the forms ‘NP fe’
and ‘NP m-fe’:
(179) a.      arko       fe
              firewood NEG
              ‘not firewood’ (Ind. bukan kayu bakar)
        b.    arko       m-fe
              firewood 3U-NEG
              ‘There is no firewood.’ (Ind. kayu bakar tidak ada)
    However, according to many informants, forms analogous to the pair in example (179)
are identical in meaning.
    There are also a few instances of -he fe which are translated by informants as ‘see it
does not work’, instead of ‘don’t see’. That is, the meaning of -he fe is the same as that of
-he m-fe. For example, in (180) a translation of y-he fe as ‘he does not see’ is inappropriate
in the context of the sentence:
(180)        y-itah   u     y-he   fe. Y-itah   u     rae    sasu
             3M-force again 3M-see NEG 3M-force again person shore
             jadi      m-haf         m-kek
             become 3U-stomach 3U-red
             ‘He forced again and he saw that it didn’t work. He forced again
             and the people of the shore became angry.’29
   Negation of clauses with m-fe is rare, but an example appears below:
(181)        au ro m-aku       m-hu m-fe
             3U rel 3U-small 3U-stay 3U-NEG
             ‘The small one didn’t stay.’
   In other words, the use of fe as a clausal negator and m-fe as its predicative counterpart
is not fully consistent. A tally of each of these forms in the texts30 showed that fe occurs
more frequently as a clausal negator than as a nominal negator. Conversely, m-fe more
commonly functions as a nominal negator than as a clausal negator. However, on the
whole, the number of attestations of fe vastly outnumbers that of m-fe. In addition, in
absolute terms fe is more common as a nominal negator than m-fe. Both the absolute
frequency of fe and the fact that it functions as a nominal negator in a considerable amount
of instances suggest that m-fe as a negator is a marginal form.","[185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"
"5.5 Other phrasal modifiers
   In §4.7.2, I introduced two manner adverbs, ati ‘really’ and tu ‘indeed, really, truly’ that
can modify an NP. These seem to be the only adverbs that modify a constituent that
functions as an NP. In the examples below, sasu ati and rae tu function as an object NP in
a clause.
(77)        ait y-ait      sasu          ati11
            3M 3M-eat sweet.potato really
            ‘He is eating a sweet potato.’
(78)        m-ape          rae       tu
            3U-give.birth person really
            ‘She gives birth to a real man.’
   Sentences (79) and (80) contain examples of the idiomatic expression po sai ‘It’s
nothing, really.’ Formally, sai is an aspect adverb (see §4.7.3).
(79)        n-sam    mai,       po      sai
            2-afraid PROHIB thing just
            ‘Don’t be afraid, it’s nothing, really.’
(80)        t-awe po         sai
            1S-say thing just
            ‘I thought12 nothing of it, really.’11
     Sasu ati, literally ‘real sweet potato’ is used in contrast with ara sasu ‘cassava’, which was introduced as a
     new crop in the Bird’s Head. Like sweet potato, cassava is a tuber, but its skin looks like wood, hence the
     term ara ‘tree’ in its name.
140         Chapter 55.6 Combinations of noun phrases
    In Maybrat, there are three ways of combining NPs, which I will refer to as
juxtaposition, apposition and enumeration.13 Of these, only enumeration is syntactically
marked.
    Enumeration involves the placement of the enumerator o (introduced in §4.11) between
two NPs. As mentioned in §4.11, o intonationally belongs to the NP that it follows.
Depending on the context, o is adequately translated as ‘and’ or ‘or’. Some examples
appear below. In an enumeration, o on the last NP in the sequence is not obligatory, as
illustrated in (83).
(81)         m-po     to-te                          Saweron o        Mosun o
             3U-hold LOC-direction.where.sun.sets Saweron ENUM Mosun ENUM
             ‘They take them along to the east, to Saweron and to Mosun.’
(82)         to-n-o       Aypokiar o         Esuyoh          o    to-au14
             area.N-far-U Aypokiar ENUM Esuyoh               ENUM LOC-DIST.U
             ‘there at Aypokiar and Esuyoh, there’
(83)         snie eok o          tuf   u       fi-t-o             m-ape
             moon two ENUM three again similar.to-near-U 3U-give.birth
             ‘Another two or three months, and she will give birth.’
    The enumerator o can be replaced by a pause without a significant change in meaning,
as indicated in the following minimal pair. In example (84b) the relation between the NPs
is juxtapositional.
(84) a.      awiah o        po     we-t-o
             taro ENUM thing location.GEN-near-U
             ‘taro and these things’
       b.    awiah # po          we-t-o
             taro         thing location.GEN-near-U
             ‘taro and these things’
   Some examples of juxtaposition were given in (71)–(73), where RCs without a head
occur one after the other. Juxtaposed NPs are not coreferential. They can be adequately
translated into English with ‘NP1 and NP2 and NP3 etc.’. Phonologically, there is always a
(short) pause between two juxtaposed NPs, marked by ‘#’:
(85)         fnia    # rae      ø-kiyam m-ama amah ø-kiyam
             woman      person ø-ill      3U-come house ø-ill
             ‘Ill woman and men came to the hospital.’12
   The verb -awe is used in pseudo-quotative constructions, referring, among others, to ‘thought content’.
   See §8.3 and §8.3.1 for a detailed discussion of this verb.
13
   Another way of combining NPs is in comitative forms, where two NPs are conjoined with the verb -sia
   ‘and’ or ‘with’ (introduced in §4.2.3.6). Because this NP conjoining is effected with a verbal form, I will
   discuss these structures in the chapter on sequences of verbs (§8.5).

   This is an example where the demonstrative form to-au is used as a substantive.

          3P ø-forget 3U-father          3U-mother
          ‘They forget their father and their mother.’

          ‘Everyone joins, the old ones and the young ones.’
  Examples of appositional NPs, that is coreferential NPs that occur next to each other,
appear below. In these NPs, a pause is not necessarily present between the NPs. The
appositional character is also reflected in the translations: the portion between commas
adds information about the preceding NP:
(88)      fane re-t-o,                 m-ana ewok, m-som
          pig location.SPEC-near-U 3U-head two     3U-play
          ‘These pigs, the two, play.’
(89)      m-me,     ana          ro    ø-huti       re-f-o,
          3U-mother 3P           REL ø-original     location.SPEC-very.near-U
          m-hu kait tapam r-ana
          3U-stay near land POSS-3U
          ‘Their mothers, the originals, live near their own grounds.’
(90)      au, ro      m-anes, m-amo ø-kpat au, ku             m-aku
          3U child 3U-old 3U-go ø-leave 3U child 3U-small
          ‘She, the old one, goes and leaves her, the small child.’
   Appositional NPs of which the second NP is formally a pronoun may be used to express
a subject or object NP with an animate referent. Normally, there is no pause between two
appositional NPs of this type. It is not clear why these appositional NPs are used: it may be
assumed to express emphasis, but this cannot be established from the context in which they
are used.
(91)      ku     ait y-hu         au
          child 3M 3M-stay DIST.U
          ‘The child stays here.’
(92)      fane au ø-sohnat16 kau
          pig 3U ø-deceive rat
          ‘The pig deceives the rat.’
(93)      y-men    fnia  au s-au
          3M-marry woman 3U one-3U
          ‘He marries one woman.’

   The form sroh, also ‘forget’ is attested in Ayawasi, while ni is not. Srohni may be a complex form, given
   that the main stress falls on the second syllable ([s´rçx»ni]).
16
   The form soh ‘deceive’ is also used. Nat in isolation is unattested. Like srohni, it may be a complex form,
   given the stress pattern ([sçx´»nAt]).
6              The clause   A clause is a unit consisting minimally of a predicate and its arguments. Its function is
to introduce new propositions in the discourse (Givón:1984:85). The description of the
clause in Maybrat must be centred around two criteria, namely syntactic and intonational:
syntactically, the simplest type of clause consists of a verb and its arguments and,
optionally, its (adverbial) modifiers. Given that the person prefix on a verb expresses its
subject when the verb functions as a clause, it can be assumed that a person prefix
functions as a subject argument in a clause. With the exception of the obligatory person
prefix, the arguments of a verb need not be expressed as NPs, leaving a clause which
formally consists of a single verb. This type of clause has a unique intonation pattern. This
intonation pattern is needed to distinguish between the two forms below: formally both
constitute a sequence of verbs, and could theoretically constitute a sequence of clauses.
However, they are intonationally different, which indicates that example (1a) syntactically
consists of two clauses, while (1b) consists of one clause, in which t-aut ara functions as
an object complement:
(1) a.   t-sam     / t-aut       ara
         1s-scared     1s-climb tree
         ‘I’m scared, and I climb into the tree.’
    b.   t-sam     t-aut      ara
         1s-scared 1s-climb tree
         ‘I’m scared to climb into the tree.’
   Examples of this type are discussed in the chapter on sequences of verbs.
   In this chapter I will restrict myself to a description of ‘simple’ clauses, that is those
consisting of a single verb as predicate. The description of sequences of clauses is deferred
until Chapter 8. The present chapter is set up as follows: in §6.1, I will give the basic
syntactic structure of the clause, and its intonational characteristics. Section 6.2 discusses
the head of the clause, §6.3 the subject and §6.4 the object. Subsequently, in §6.5, nominal
clauses are presented. Topicalisation is described in §6.6. In §6.7, I will discuss
relativisation, that is the extraction of subject and object arguments from single-verb
clauses. In §6.8, the various types of adverbials that add extra information to a clause are
treated. These adverbials are collectively referred to as the ‘periphery’ of the clause. The
different types of periphery that can be distinguished are the time periphery; the manner
periphery; the aspect periphery; and the focus periphery. In §6.8.5 I will show that these
                                                142

§6.9 negation, formed with the adverb fe, is discussed. In §6.10, the clausal determiner is
described. In §6.11, I will give some examples of anaphoric reference, although this is,
strictly speaking, a discourse phenomenon, and not a clausal phenomenon.","[157, 158, 159, 160, 161]"

    It is interesting to see that Jane Brown (MS) did find a difference in Ayamaru between inclusive (anu, b-)
    and exclusive (amu, n-) in the first person plural. In Ayawasi some people also claimed that this difference
    exists, but proceeded to translate the Indonesian forms kita (we, incl) and kami (we, excl.) into Maybrat
    amu and anu respectively, where it should be noted that anu also refers to second person plural.
    Eventually it turned out that many people used both the Indonesian and the putative Maybrat inclusive and
    exclusive forms inconsistently. Hence my conclusion that there is no morphological difference between
    the two.
                                                                                       Word classes       65(14)        amu p-kah       ora
            1P 1P-burn garden
            ‘We (excl.) burn a garden.’
(15)        anu n-not p-awiya6
            2P 2-think thing-INT
            ‘What do you think?’
(16)        anu p-kias ania
            2P 1P-tell each.other
            ‘You (and we), we tell each other.’
   In the second person, there is no difference between singular and plural in the
pronominal prefixes. So, (17) below is ambiguous.
(17)        n-fot    fiam     re-t-o
            2-catch catfish location.SPEC-near-U
            ‘You (S, P) catch that catfish!’
   If the verb involved has an a-initial stem, singular and plural forms can be distinguished
in the second person, since plural forms of this type lack the vowel a. An example is given
in (18) (see also §3.3).
(18) a.     n-ama
            2-come
            ‘You (s) come!’
       b.   n-ma
            2-come.P
            ‘You (P) come!’
   The second person plural is also used to refer to you (P) in a very general sense, for
example in (19), in which the second person form is adequately translated as ‘one’.7
(19)        n-ros n-pet                 rae n-o      po                ka
            2-stand 2-woman.marry.man man 2-take ceremonial.cloth eh?
            ‘You mean when one gets up and marries a man, one receives ceremonial
            cloth, right?
   All the free forms of the personal pronouns can function as the head of an NP (see
§5.1), and as the subject or object in a clause (see Chapter 6).
   In addition to these pronominal forms, Maybrat has a form to refer to ‘twosome’,
namely pae(n). This form can only refer to humans. Like the free personal pronouns,
pae(n) can function as a subject in a clause. However, it is unattested in object position.
The form pae(n) has a plural referent, but it is unmarked for person, because the person
prefix on the following verb can be any plural form:
(20)        paen      p-uut      p-ma
            twosome 1P-climb.P 1P-come.P
            ‘We (excl.) two climb and come.’

    In interrogative forms, y is used between vowels since it is assumed ya in these forms is an interrogative
    suffix, by analogy to other interrogative forms (see §4.5).
7
    Formally, this form can also refer to singular. However, then the sentence would have been addressed to
    one person in particular, which was not the case here.
66      Chapter 4(21)        paen     n-mo to tauf
            twosome 2-go.P LOC forest
            ‘You two go to the forest!’
(22)        paen      m-amo aya
            twosome 3U-go water
            ‘The two (of them) go to the river.’4.1.2 Possessive pronouns
   To indicate possession, a marker ro- ‘POSS’ is prefixed to the free form of the pronoun.
In the first and second person singular this marker is in free variation with the marker a-. If
the personal pronoun begins with a vowel, the possessive prefix normally appears as r-
(see also §3.4). The possessive pronouns are as follows:
(23)              Person      Possessive form
            S      1          ro-tuo/a-tuo
                   2          ro-nuo/a-nuo
                   3M         r-ait     (<ro-ait)
                   3U         r-au      (<ro-au)
            P       1         r-amu     etc.
                    2         r-anu
                    3         r-ana
   If the possessor is emphasised, the possessive prefix may appear as ro-, even though the
following pronoun is vowel-initial:
(24) a.     amah r-ait
            house POSS-3M
            ‘his house’
       b.   amah ro-ait
            house POSS-3M
            ‘his house (and not someone else’s)’
   Unlike the free forms of the personal pronouns, these possessive forms cannot function
as a subject or an object in a clause. They can only function as modifiers to a nominal head
in an NP:
(25)        amah r-au         m-of
            house POSS-3U 3U-good
            ‘Her house is nice.’
  If the possessor is not expressed by a pronoun, ro functions as a morpheme to mark the
possessor:
(26)        ora     ro-Yan
            garden POSS-Yan
            ‘Yan’s garden.’
     See §5.2 for more discussion of possessive forms.
                                                                         Word classes     674.1.3 Emphatic pronouns
  The free forms of the personal pronouns can be prefixed by the form po- ‘EMPH’ to
express emphasis. The form po- is adequately translated as ‘alone’ or ‘on my/your/etc.
own’. If the pronoun begins with a vowel, the prefix appears as p-.
(27)                Person        Emphatic form
            S        1            po-tuo
                     2            po-nuo
                     3M           p-ait  (< po-ait)
                     3U           p-au   (< po-au)
            P        1            p-amu etc.
                     2            p-anu
                     3            p-ana
  These emphatic forms cannot function as a subject or an object in a clause, but only as
manner adverbials, as illustrated in (28). See §6.8.2 for a discussion on manner adverbials.
(28)        m-roh       p-ana      aya
            3U-descend EMPH-3P water
            ‘They descend to the river on their own.’
4.1.4 Other forms
   The form po can also be prefixed to the numerals s-ait ‘one-3M’ and eok ‘two’. The
resulting forms, po-s-ait ‘alone’ and p-eok ‘two alone’ are pronouns that can function as a
subject, as in (29) and (30). It is unattested in object position. The form po-s-ait can also
refer to a female as in (29b). The form *po-s-au does not occur. The forms p-eok and
pae(n) (31) and (32) both refer explicitly to two people, although the difference between
these two forms is not clear.8 In (31), peok functions as an apposition to the head of the NP
ana (see §5.6 for appositions).
(29) a.     po-s-ait      y-amo Kumurkek
            EMPH-one-3M 3M-go Kumurkek
            ‘He goes to Kumurkek alone.’
       b.   po-s-ait       m-amo Kumurkek
            EMPH-one-3M    3U-go Kumurkek
            ‘She goes to Kumurkek alone.’
(30)        p-eok      p-mo Mosun
            EMPH-two   1P-go Mosun
            ‘The two (of us), we go to Mosun.’
(31)        ana p-eok         m-hu akah
            3P EMPH-two 3U-stay above
            ‘The two, they stay above.’8
    It may be the case that one of these forms is dialectal.
68     Chapter 4(32)       paen p-uut        p-ma
           two 1P-climb.P 1P-com.P
           ‘The two of us come up.’
   The pronominal form ania ‘each other’ is used to express reciprocity. The form ania
can occupy the object position (but not the subject position) in a clause.
(33)       rae    m-siar    m-me      ania
           person 3U-many 3U-fight each.other
           ‘Many people fight with each other.’
(34)       ana ø-sayim ania
           3P ø-share each.other
           ‘They share it with each other.’

   Morphologically, verbs can be defined as those words that take obligatory person
prefixes. Under certain circumstances this prefix is not phonologically realised due to
morphophonological constraints. These constraints, as well as paradigms of declined verbs,
have already been discussed in §3.1. In this section, we also illustrated that verbs and
inalienably possessed nouns are morphologically identical. Some paradigms representative
of all the different morphophonological paradigms of verbs are given in (35) for the sake
of convenience:
(35)                ‘not know’     ‘do’       ‘sleep’   ‘climb’     ‘emerge’
       S      1       t-oa         t-no       t-tien    t-aut       ø-frok
              2       n-oa         n-no       n-tien    n-aut       ø-frok
              3M      y-oa         y-no       y-tien    y-aut       ø-frok
              3U      m-oa         m-no       m-tien    m-aut       ø-frok
       P      1       p-oa         p-no       p-tien    p-uut       ø-frok
              2       n-oa         n-no       n-tien    n-uut       ø-frok
              3       m-oa         m-no       m-tien    m-aut       ø-frok
   Because verbs and inalienably possessed nouns are morphologically identical, we need
to use a syntactic criterion to distinguish these two categories: syntactically, verbs are
words that can function as a minimal predicate. The person prefix is coreferent with the
subject of the clause. In (36) this subject is not expressed as an NP, while in (37) it is (see
§6.3 for a discussion on subject NPs in clauses).
(36)       y-amo
           3M-go
           ‘He goes.’
(37)       rae y-amo
           man 3M-go
           ‘The man goes.’
                                                                             Word classes   69   Only three forms are attested without a person prefix for reasons other than
morphophonological ones, namely -akus ‘left.behind’, -rof ‘follow’ and -roh ‘descend’. In
constructions in which these prefixless verbs feature, they are invariably directly preceded
by an overtly or covertly inflected verb. An example of -akus functioning as an
(intransitive) main verb is given in (38a), which consists of two clauses separated by a
comma. Example (39b) includes the same verb, but without a person prefix:
(38) a.   rae m-e       biskui, tuo t-akus
          man 3U-give biscuit 1S 1S-leave.behind
          ‘The people give biscuits, I’m left out.’ (i.e. I don’t get any)
     b.   t-se       akus        sasu
          1S-place left.behind sweet.potato
          ‘I place the sweet potato and leave it behind temporarily.’
   In constructions like (38b), the bare-stem verb functions as an adverbial, that is it
modifies or specifies the preceding verb. These constructions are described in detail in
§8.2.
   In compound nouns of the type N+V, where V is an ‘adjectival verb’, a person prefix
may also be omitted (see §4.3.5).","[82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87]"
"

    The adverbial fe in the second conjunct is unattested.
180      Chapter 77.1.3.1 Nominal question words
   The question word awiya ‘who’ normally replaces an entire NP. This NP corresponds to
the human subject or object of a clause. Some examples are:
(16)       awiya y-per        fra ø-kron
           who 3M-step.on {stone ø-sound}
           ‘Who stepped on the sounding stone?’
(17)       awiya kerja po, awiya y-kah        ora,   awiya ø-saruk po au
           who work thing who 3M-burn garden who ø-cook thing DIST.U
           ‘Who works, who makes a garden, and who cooks here?’
(18)       Yul Yumte m-pet       awiya
           Yul Yumte 3U-marry who
           ‘Who did Yul Yumte marry?’
    Likewise, p-awiya ‘what’ (lit. ‘thing-who’) can replace an NP. Some examples are:
(19)       p-awiya      ø-ptek
           thing-who ø-fall
           ‘What (is it that) fell?’
(20)       n-asah p-awiya
           2-laugh thing-who
           ‘What are you laughing at?’
(21)       n-no p-awiya     u
           2-do thing-who again
           ‘What else do you want to do?’
   When the question is about the nature of a head noun in an NP, the question word
immediately follows that noun. For instance, the answer to example (22) might be fane
rapuoh ro m-api ‘the wild pig that is big’; fane rapuoh ro m-aku ‘the wild pig that is small’
and so on:
(22)        fane rapuoh p-awiya       m-hoh fi-t-o
           {pig forest} thing-who 3U-run like-near-U
           ‘What wild pig is running like this?’
   The question word po p-awiya ‘what thing’, rather than p-awiya ‘what’, is used when
specific information about a thing is requested. Some examples follow:
(23)       orie n-no po       p-awiya ti4
           now 2-do thing thing-who also
           ‘What else do you want to do now?’ (lit. ‘what thing do you want to do now?’)
    The question word po p-awiya can also function as a nominal clause:
(24)       rae     m-he     m-awe po       p-awiya        re-au
           person 3U-see 3U-say thing thing-who location.SPEC-DIST.U
           ‘The people saw it and said: “What is this thing?”’4
    Ti seems to function as a kind of focus adverbial here (see §4.7.6). This form is found in dialects spoken
    to the north of Ayawasi.
                                                                                             Mood      181(25)       po ktuo5 t-per      re          aya   m-roh
           thing 1S 1s-step.on in.order.to water 3U-descend
           re-au                   po     p-awiya
           location.SPEC-DIST.U thing thing-who
           ‘This thing that I stepped on which caused the water to descend, what is it?’
   The question word r-awiya ‘whose’ (POSS-who) replaces the possessor and follows the
‘possessed’ in the NP, according to the regular order in constructions where the possessor
is an alienably possessed noun, that is possessed-possessor, (see §5.2). Some examples
follow:
(26)       fane r-awiya     m-ait ora
           pig POSS-who 3M-eat garden
           ‘Whose pig ate the garden?’
(27)       ait y-ata     tuo         r-awiya
           3M 3M-drink palm.wine POSS-who
           ‘Whose palm wine did he drink?’
(28)       po    r-awiya      me-t-o
           thing POSS-who PRESTT-near-U
           ‘Whose thing is this?’
  If the possessor is an inalienably possessed noun referring to a human, the form awiya
‘who’ replaces the possessor:
(29)       awiya y-atia
           who 3M-father
           ‘whose father?’
(30)       awiya m-atem
           who 3U-hand/arm
           ‘whose hand/arm?’
(31)       awiya m-aim
           who 3U-wing
           ‘whose wing?’
   Interrogative forms involving inalienably possessed nouns referring to attributes of
plants, that is leaves, roots and so on are unattested in the data.6
   The question word tiya7 ‘how much/many’ follows the classifier in the NP, according to
the regular position of the numeral in the NP (see §5.1.4):
(32)       rae    m-ana tiya           m-aut     ru
           person 3U-head how.many 3U-climb bird
           ‘How many people boarded the aeroplane?’
5
    Ktuo is a dialectal form used in the area to the north of Ayawasi: this instance was recorded by someone
    from the Bame family.
6
    Hypothetical examples would be p-awiya m-ata ‘what kind of leaf’; p-awiya m-tis ‘what kind of root’.
7
    Tiya is often realised phonetically with an optional phoneme schwa, i.e. [´»tija] (see §2.1.1.1).
182    Chapter 7(33)    t-e     pitis m-ata tiya
        1S-give money 3U-leaf how.many
        ‘How many banknotes should I give?’
    The interrogative ro-yo ‘which one’ (REL-INT) follows the head noun about which more
information is requested. This follows the regular pattern of RCs, in which the head noun
is followed by the RC marker ro and the relativised clause (see §5.3). Some examples are:
(34)    ara ro-yo, ro m-api fe             ro ø-kiniah
        tree REL-INT REL 3U-big NEG REL ø-small
        ‘Which tree, the big one or the small one?’
(35)    apan m-afit ku         ro-yo
        snake 3U-bite child REL-INT
        ‘Which child did the snake bite?’7.1.3.2 Time
   The temporal question word titiya ‘when’ invariably occurs in clause-initial position,
which is where the temporal periphery is normally located (see §6.8.1). Examples
involving titiya are given below. In (36) the comma indicates the beginning of a new
clause. In (37), the object po-kuo r-anu re-f-o has been fronted (see §6.4 on objects).
(36)    n-amo tapam ro-nuo, titiya n-e            u
        2-go    land POSS-2S when 2-return again
        ‘You go to your country, when will you return again?’
(37)    po-kuo        r-anu     re-f-o,               titiya n-kuo
        NOM-feast.P POSS-2P location.SPEC-very.near-U when 2-feast.P
        ‘This feast of yours, when will you have it?’
   Unlike the temporal adverbials, titiya is unattested between a subject NP and a
predicate.","[197, 198, 199, 200]"
"4.2.2.3 Quantifying verbs
   Semantically, quantifiers are words that express contrasts in quantity (Crystal
1991:286). As is the case for adjectival notions, Maybrat uses forms that are
morphologically verbs to express quantifying notions. Dik (1987:153) points out that
relative adjectives, such as ‘big’/‘small’, ‘heavy’/‘light’ etc. and relative quantifiers such as
‘many’/‘some’/‘few’ are notionally similar to one another. Thus, it is not surprising that
Maybrat expresses both adjectival notions and quantifiers in one category. The fact that
quantification is expressed through verbs is not exceptional (cf. Schachter 1985:38). Three
of the forms in (51), namely -kak, -tut and -siar are morphologically identical to verbs in
that they take person prefixes.
(51)        -kak      ‘absolutely everyone/everything’
            prut      ‘everyone/everything’
            pria(n)   ‘everyone/everything’
            -tut      ‘everyone’ (small group)
            wisau     ‘everyone/everything’
            waro      ‘little’
            okair     ‘little’
            -siar     ‘many’
   It is difficult to make a clear-cut semantic distinction between some of these quantifiers.
I have attempted to make some contrasts below:
   While -kak means ‘absolutely everyone/everything’, as in (52), prut just refers to
‘everything, all’ as in (53). In other words, -kak is more extreme than prut.
(52)        m-su       aya m-kak
            3U-drown water 3U-absolutely.everyone
            ‘Every single one of them drowns.’
                                                                            Word classes   73(53)     m-ait awiah ø-prut
         3U-eat taro ø-everything
         ‘They eat all the taro.’
   The difference between prut and pria is that prut primarily refers to inanimates, see
(53), whereas pria primarily refers to animates, see (54)–(55):
(54)     m-tien   ø-pria
         3U-sleep ø-everyone
         ‘Everyone sleeps.’
(55)     m-hu m-ape              ø-pria
         3U-stay 3U-give.birth ø-everyone
         ‘Everyone lives (there) and bears children.’
   However, in (56) prut refers to animates, while in (57) pria refers to inanimates:
(56)     ø-prut       m-nan po-ø-safom
         ø-everyone 3U-like NOM-ø-green
         ‘Everyone (stands) like grass’ (They all stand so close together
         that they are like grass.)
(57)     asam         ø-pria
         sugarcane ø-everything
         ‘all the sugarcane’/‘This is all sugarcane.’
   These examples illustrate that a clear-cut semantic distinction between prut and pria in
terms of animate and inanimate cannot be made.
   Unlike prut and pria, prian ‘everything’ can only refer to inanimates.
(58)     m-amo m-hu m-kah ø-prian
         3U-go 3U-stay 3U-burn ø-everything
         ‘They go and they stay there and they burn everything.’
   The quantifier wisau ‘everything, everyone’ is used for both animates and inanimates. It
refers to a large group, as opposed to -tut ‘everyone’, which can only refer to a small group
of less than ten people. Some examples:
(59)     p-tut       p-mo aya
         1P-everyone 1P-go.P water
         ‘We (small group) all go to the river.’
(60)     rapu    anu ø-wisau
         morning 2P ø-everyone
         ‘Good morning to you all.’
   The quantifiers okair and waro ‘little’ differ little semantically, but they do have
different syntactic properties: like pria(n) ‘everyone/everything’, okair cannot function as
an attributive in an NP. Apart from clearly showing characteristics of quantifiers, waro can
also function as a temporal adverbial meaning ‘in a little while’ (see §6.8.1). Some
examples in which okair and waro function as quantifiers follow:
(61)     rae m-ama m-me          ania         ø-okair
         man 3U-come 3U-fight each.other ø-little
         ‘The people come and they (only) fight each other a little.’
74      Chapter 4(62)        kamean         y-o        mes ø-waro
            black.cockatoo 3M-take blood ø-little
            ‘The black cockatoo takes a little bit of blood.’
   In conclusion, it seems that there are a number of synonyms or near-synonyms in the
class of quantifying verbs.13
   Morphologically, some quantifying verbs take person prefixes:
(63)        rae m-kak
            man 3U-absolutely.everyone
            ‘absolutely everyone of the people’/‘There are people everywhere.’
(64)        anu n-siar
            2P   2-many
            ‘many of you’/‘You are with many.’
(65)        amu p-tut
            1P    1P-everyone
            ‘everyone of us (incl.)’/‘We (incl.) are with many.’
   The other quantifiers listed above do not take person prefixes. This, however, does not
exclude the possibility that they are formally verbs. The problem is that they all consist of
two syllables, which, if they were verbs, means that they cannot take person prefixes
because of the morphophonological constraint on bisyllabic words (see §3.1). By analogy
to -kak, -siar and -tut I conclude that the words that express quantifying notions in Maybrat
are formally verbs. They are therefore given a covert person prefix ‘ø-’.
   Like adjectival verbs, quantifying verbs can either function attributively or predicatively
(except prian and okair, which can only function predicatively, see above). This is
indicated in the translations of (63)–(65) above. An example where there are syntactic
criteria to determine whether the quantifying verb functions attributively or predicatively
appears below. In (66a) n-siar functions attributively in the NP anu n-siar f-o, where I
assume that the demonstrative fo is the last element in the NP (see Chapter 5, and §5.1.6).
This NP functions as a subject. In (66b) n-siar functions predicatively, its subject is anu
f-o. Intonationally, both examples constitute a clause:
(66) a.     anu n-siar     f-o           n-mo            ayà /
            2P 2P-many very.near-U 2-go.P                river
            ‘The many of you go to the river.’
       b.   anu f-o           n-siàr /
            2p very.near-U 2-many
            ‘There are many of you.’
   Admittedly, there are only a few forms in which a demonstrative is available to prove
the syntactic function of the quantifying verbs. Although (63) has a typically ‘clausal’
intonation pattern, this was not so clear for (64) and (65). In (67) it is not clear what the13
     This synonymy can possibly be attributed to the fact that these forms are taken from different dialects.
     Unfortunately I have been unable to verify this.
                                                                               Word classes   75syntactic function of the quantifying verb is, since there are no conclusive intonational
cues.14 It is also unclear whether there is a significant semantic difference:
(67) a.     amah ø-wisau re-f-o
            house ø-all       location.SPEC-very.near-U
            ‘all these houses/every house’
       b.   amah re-f-o                     ø-wisau
            house location.SPEC-very.near-U ø-all
            ‘all the houses/every house’
   It seems that in (67) the quantifying verb ‘floats’ through the sentence. A property
associated with quantifiers is their ability to ‘float’ through a syntactic constituent rather
than occupy a fixed position (Crystal 1991:286), so the pair in (67), and the other examples
where the syntactic function of the quantifying verb seems elusive may be typical for this
particular word class.","[90, 91, 92, 93]"
"6.8.1 Time
    In the temporal periphery, the question of ‘when’ the action described in the clause took
place or will take place is answered. The temporal periphery precedes s-V in a clause, as
illustrated in example (43). If the subject of a clause is also expressed by a full NP, then the
temporal adverbial may either precede this subject, or follow it, as illustrated in (44). The
difference in meaning between these two forms is, according to informants, negligible. The
scope of the temporal adverbial is the entire clause that follows.
(43)        is        y-pat     Konya y-ama
            yesterday 3M-from Konya 3M-come
            ‘Yesterday he came from Konya.’
(44) a.     pi   ait ira          y-apum au
            man 3M just.now 3M-hide U.DIST
            ‘The man hid there just now.’
       b.   ira       pi   ait y-apum au
            just.now man 3M 3M-hide U.DIST
            ‘Just now the man hid there.’
   Temporal adverbs can be combined, in order to make time reference more specific. The
mutual ordering of the two time adverbs does not seem to be crucial, given the examples in
(47) and (48): in (47) the temporal adverbial is tian pose, while in (48) it is pose tian.
(45)        men      rapu     p-mo ora
            tomorrow morning 1P-go.P garden
            ‘Tomorrow morning we will go to the garden.’
(46)        is         mti y-tien        fe
            yesterday night 3M-sleep NEG
            ‘Last night he did not sleep.’

            ‘A long time ago in the past, the Dutch people lived (there).’
   Temporal adverbs, introduced in §4.7.1, can only occur in the temporal periphery of a
clause. In addition, there are a number of numerals and demonstratives which can function
as temporal adverbials.
   Many languages have temporal deictic forms which are derived from, or based on,
spatial demonstratives (Anderson & Keenan 1985:297–300; Heine et al. 1991:31). In
Maybrat the demonstrative me-f-o can function as a temporal adverbial.10 Some examples
are:
(49)        me-f-o             t-ait  po-iit
            PRESTT-very.near-U 1S-eat NOM-eat.P

(50)        Mafif y-awe, me-f-o                  t-fat
            Mafif 3M-say PRESTT-very.near-U 1S-fell
            ‘Mafif says, “Now I’m felling (a tree).”’
(51)        Agus me-f-o                 ø-farkor m-ae Jayapura
            Agus PRESTT-very.near-U ø-study 3U-at Jayapura
            ‘Agus is studying at Jayapura now.’
   Likewise, the directional tis ‘behind’ and the complex directional to-tis ‘LOC-behind’
can occur in the temporal periphery of a clause. In this function, tis is adequately translated
as ‘finally’, and to-tis as ‘in the end’. Both notionally refer to time:
(52)        m-nan      tis      m-nies     ro y-api t-a            ø-sruer
            after.this finally 3U-smell REL 3M-big near-U ø-scattered
            ‘After this, finally, he smells the big one which lies scattered (on the ground).’
(53)        to-tis        ait y-no po           m-of
            LOC-behind 3m 3m-do thing 3u-good
            ‘In the end he does well.’ (lit. ‘In the end he does good things.’)
     Below, an example of a nominal clause modified by to-tis is given:
(54)        to-tis       y-ana       s-ait ku sme
            LOC-behind 3M-head one-3M child male
            ‘The last one is a boy.’
10
     I noted one instance of the demonstrative we-f-o functioning as a temporal adverbial:
         we-f-o                     anu p-he      apan potafit    sawiah m-apuf
         location.GEN-very.near-U 1P 1P-see {snake potafit} ø-tail 3U-short
         ‘Now we see that the potafit snake has a short tail.’
                                                                            The clause     153   Some NPs that notionally refer to time, such as snie ‘month’ or tein ‘year’ can function
as temporal adverbials. These NPs can be modified by a numeral (55)–(57), and, if the
head is snie ‘month’, by the name of the month (58):
(55)     snie     tuf    Fince m-ape             ku
         month three Fince 3U-give.birth child
         ‘In three months Fince will give birth.’
(56)     tein s-au       y-amo y-hu        Sorong
         year one-3U 3M-go 3M-live Sorong
         ‘In a year he’s going to live in Sorong.’
(57)     snie    eok om m-ais u
         month two rain 3U-fall again
         ‘In two months it will rain again.’
(58)     snie   Maret ana ø-skie amah m-arak
         month March 3P ø-build house 3U-empty
         ‘In March they will finish building the house.’
   The expression um sau, as in (59), is an idiomatic expression, used to introduce a new
story. It is adequately translated as ‘once upon a time’.
(59)     um       s-au    eok m-ros         m-kah     ora
         moment one-3U two 3U-stand 3U-burn garden
         ‘Once upon a time the two stand and burn a garden.’
(60)     um       s-au    arin         mti oh …
         moment one-3U situation night already
         ‘Once upon a time, it is already night …’
   As already illustrated in §4.7.1, numerals can also be used as time adverbials. In
practice, only the numerals from ‘three’ to ‘six’ are used in this function. To refer to a time
span larger than six days, the Indonesian term Hari Minggu ‘Sunday’ is used. ‘Sundays’
can be modified by a numeral to refer to the number of weeks. Some examples are:
(61)     Hari Minggu s-au        amu p-mo ø-twok sembahyang’
         {Sunday}       one-3U 1P 1P-go.P ø-enter pray
         ‘On one (a particular) Sunday, we go and enter and pray.’
(62)     Hari Minggu tuf t-amo Negeri Belanda             u
         {Sunday}        three 1S-go {The Netherlands} again
         ‘After three Sundays I will go to The Netherlands again.’
   In example (63) the nominal clause waro fi-f-o ‘a little while, like this’, places the
action described in the clause in time. In other words, waro fi-f-o functions like a temporal
adverbial.
(63)     au m-aut      na           waro fi-f-o                     aya  m-aut
         3U 3U-climb and.then little similar.to-very.near-U water 3U-climb
         ‘She climbs, and in a little while like this, the water rises.’
154       Chapter 66.8.2 Manner
   In the manner periphery, questions about ‘the way in which’ or ‘how’ an event takes
place are answered. Manner adverbials occur in clause-final position, and their scope is the
entire clause they modify. Some examples follow:
(64)        anu n-no       iso f-o      kaket
            2P 2-make road very.near-U well
            ‘You build this road well.’
(65)        ait y-awia toro
            3M 3M-cry many.times
            ‘He cries many times.’
(66)        rae      pris11 pose          m-atak     mimo
            person police long.time.ago 3U-angry very
            ‘A long time ago, the policemen were very angry.’
(67)        n-amo rere
            2-go    carefully
            ‘Go carefully.’
   In the examples above, the manner periphery is filled by manner adverbs, introduced in
§4.7.2. The occurrence of manner adverbs is restricted to the manner periphery of a clause.
   The manner periphery can also be filled by forms that function as manner adverbials,
but formally belong to other word classes. The reason for analysing these forms as manner
adverbials is twofold: firstly, like the other manner adverbs, they occur in clause-final
position, thus taking the same syntactic position as manner adverbs. Secondly, they
stipulate how the action referred to in the clause is carried out, in other words, they have
the same semantic content as manner adverbials. A distinction can be made between two
types of ‘functional manner adverbials’, namely non-verbal forms and verbal forms. The
non-verbal forms are listed in (68). With the exception of rere, all are morphologically
complex.
(68)        rere ‘carefully’
            – demonstrative forms prefixed with fi- (see §4.4.2)
            – emphatic pronouns, that is pronouns prefixed with po- (see §4.1.3)
   Rere, when it occurs in clause-initial position, functions as a temporal adverbial
meaning ‘shortly’, as illustrated in (69) (see §4.7.1). In clause-final position rere functions
as a manner adverbial meaning ‘carefully’, as in (70) and (71):
(69)        rere     p-mo p-te           aya
            shortly 1P-go.P 1P-bathe.P water
            ‘Shortly we will go and bathe.’
(70)        au m-wian      aya     rere
            3U 3U-scoop water carefully
            ‘She scoops water carefully.’
11
     Pris is a loan from Du politie ‘police’ (see §2.8).
                                                                           The clause    155(71)     n-amo rere
         2-go    carefully
         ‘Walk carefully.’
   Demonstrative forms with the prefix fi- ‘similar to’ that is fi-f-o, fi-t-o and so on (see
§4.4.2) can also function as manner adverbials:
(72)     ku     ø-kiniah t-o       ø-hren fi-f-o
         child ø-small near-U ø-sit          similar.to-very.near-U
         ‘That small child sat down like this.’
(73)     ru    wamoh m-ait ara m-ake                fi-t-o
         {bird wamoh} 3U-eat tree 3U-fruit similar.to-near-U
         ‘The wamoh bird ate the (tree)fruit like this.’
(74)     n-no fi-n-o              mai
         2-do similar.to-far-U PROHIB
         ‘Don’t do it like that.’
(75)     ana m-ape            fi-au
         they 3U-look.after similar.to-U.DIST
         ‘They look after people/animals like that.’
   Examples of emphatic pronouns functioning as manner adverbials are given below:
(76)     p-tien   p-amu
         1P-sleep EMPH-1P
         ‘We sleep on our own.’
(77)     y-hu      p-ait        m-ae ara m-ato re-f-o
         3M-stay EMPH-3M 3M-at tree 3U-hole location.SPEC-near-U
         ‘He is alone in this treehole.’
(78)     tuo t-hu      po-tuo     we-f-o
         1S 1S-stay EMPH-1S location.GEN-very.near-U
         ‘I stay at mine (i.e. my place) here.’
  The verbal forms that can function as manner adverbs are listed in example (79).
Formally, these are all regular intransitive verbs (see §4.2.2.1). Some examples follow:
(79)     -hai       ‘extremely’ (lit. ‘die’)
         srot       ‘quickly’
         -ase       ‘seriously’
         sre        ‘wrong’
   These four forms can all function as main verbs, as illustrated in examples (80)–(83):
(80)     y-atia      y-hai
         3M-father 3M-die
         ‘His father is dead.’
(81)     ait ø-srot mimo
         3M ø-quick very
         ‘He is very fast.’
156         Chapter 6(82)         tuo t-ase
             1S 1S-huge
             ‘I’m fat.’
(83)         nuo ø-sre
             2S ø-wrong
             ‘You’re wrong.’
   In examples (84)–(87) these three verbs function as manner adverbs:
(84)         sinef m-of     m-haì    /
             view 3U-nice 3U-die
             ‘The view is extremely beautiful.’
(85)         ait y-amo ø-sròt /
             3M 3M-go ø-quick
             ‘He walks fast.’
(86)         ø-skoh t-me         m-asè   /
             ø-enjoy 1S-mother 3U-seriously
             ‘I really love my mother.’
(87)         ku     m-ana eok re-f-o                     m-amo ø-srè /
             child 3U-head two location.spec-very.near-U 3U-go ø-wrong
             ‘These two children go the wrong way.’
   When used adverbially, there is subject agreement between the subject of the clause and
-hai ‘extremely’, clearly showing the verbal character of this form. This is not the case for
the verb -ase ‘seriously’:
(88)         ait y-asah      y-haì /
             3M 3M-laugh 3M-die
             ‘He laughs his head off.’
(89)         ait ø-kiyam m-asè         /
             3M ø-ill       3U-seriously
             ‘He is seriously ill.’
   In all these examples, the verb which functions as an adverbial directly follows the main
verb of the clause. This suggests the possibility that instead of one clause, the examples in
(84)–(87) actually constitute two clauses. However, all the utterances in (84)–(87) are
dominated by one single clausal intonation contour (see §6.1), suggesting that they are
monoclausal. Inserting a pause, as illustrated in (90b), results in a different construction in
which the second verb functions as a main verb. This is reflected in the semantic
difference.
(90) a.      eok ø-tetet     m-haì /
             two ø-happy 3U-die
             ‘The two are extremely happy.’
       b.    eok ø-tetèt    / m-haì
             two ø-happy        3U-die
             ‘The two are happy. They die.’
                                                                              The clause   1576.8.3 Aspect
    The aspect periphery says something about the ‘internal structure’ of an event. The
aspect periphery normally occurs in clause-final position. Below, the aspect periphery is
filled by aspect adverbs (see §4.7.3).
(91)        swi        ø-phah ewa
            ko.cuscus ø-angry often
            ‘The “swi” is often angry.’
(92)        ait y-atak      twat
            3M 3M-angry always
            ‘He is always angry.’
(93)        m-he    ku      r-au,       m-ape          f-o,           y-anes oh
            3U-see child POSS-3U 3U-give.birth very.near-U 3M-old already
            ‘She looks at her child, that she gave birth to, he’s already old.’
   Unlike manner adverbs, aspect adverbs may precede the object in a clause, as in
examples (94)–(95).
(94)        p-ri      ewa ru
            1S-hear.P often bird
            ‘We often hear the aeroplane.’ (i.e. the aeroplane often comes)
(95)        y-o       u       sa ira
            3M-take again fish just.now
            ‘He takes the fish of just now again.’
   The position of the aspect adverbial in the clause can bring about a change in meaning.
In example (96a) the adverbial precedes the object, whereas in (96b) it occupies the clause-
final position after the object. These two forms are semantically slightly different: in the a-
form the emphasis of the adverbial is on the predicate, implying that the ‘deceiving’ is
repeated, whereas in the b-form the emphasis is more on the object, implying that ‘he’ is
repeatedly ‘deceived’.
(96) a.     Siwa ø-srokena u         ait
            Siwa ø-deceive again 3M
            ‘Siwa deceives him again.’
       b.   Siwa ø-srokena ait u
            Siwa ø-deceive 3M again
            ‘Siwa deceives him again.’
   A number of aspect adverbs semantically refer to the duration of an event. Some
examples follow:
(97)        ku     y-awia fares
            child 3M-cry still
            ‘The child is still crying.’
(98)        ku     ø-kiniah y-awia yoyo
            child ø-small 3M-cry continuously
            ‘The small child cries continuously.’
158       Chapter 6(99)        fnia  anu p-no po         re-t-o                   fawen      fe
            woman 2P 1P-do thing location.SPEC-near-U long.time NEG
            ‘We women (inc), we haven’t done this thing for a long time.’
    Some NPs which notionally refer to a time span can function as aspect adverbials, as
illustrated below. Recall that snie and tein can also function as temporal adverbials (see
§6.8.1).
(100)       m-tien    snie    s-au
            3U-sleep month one-3U
            ‘They sleep for one month.’
(101)       ø-fukum Maru12 tein s-au
            ø-jail     Maru year one-3U
            ‘(I was) jailed in Maru for one year.’
  Noun phrases headed by um ‘moment’ or kai ‘time’ can also function as aspect
adverbials:
(102)       ana m-hu      um        tuf
            3p 3p-stay moment three
            ‘They stayed for three moments (time-spans).’
(103)       tukar kiyit13 kai s-au
            change kiyit time one-3U
            ‘(We) changed kiyits once.’
   The form fo, which is related to the demonstrative f-o, can function as an aspect
adverbial. Semantically, the meaning of -f- ‘very.near’ is extended to mean very near in
time, referring to inceptive aspect. In this function, fo, glossed ‘INCEPT’ (inceptive) is
adequately translated as ‘beginning.to’. Some contrasts involving fo and other aspect
adverbials:
(104)       au m-amo aya         fo
            3U 3U-go water INCEPT
            ‘She is beginning to go to the river now.’
(105)       au m-amo aya          oh
            3U 3U-go water already
            ‘She’s already left for the river.’
(106)       au m-amo aya           fares
            3U 3U-go water still
            ‘She’s still at the river.’
   The aspect adverbial fo contrasts with the demonstrative f-o, as illustrated in example
(107): the a-form fo functions as an aspect adverbial, while in the b-form f-o is used as a
12
     Maru refers to Ayamaru.
13
     Kiyits are cloths worn by women (see Appendix II).
                                                                                        The clause      159substantive, and refers to ‘it’ (here a path).14 The two examples in (107) are homophonous,
the interpretation depending on the context in which they occur.
(107) a. tuo t-hoh fo          t-amo Kumurkek
         1S 1S-run INCEPT 1S-go Kumurkek
         ‘I begin to run now, and I go to Kumurkek.’
        b. tuo t-hoh f-o                 t-amo Kumurkek
           1S 1S-run very.near-U 1S-go Kumurkek
           ‘I run over this one (i.e. this path) and I go to Kumurkek.’
     The verb m-arak ‘It is empty’ can also function as an aspect adverbial meaning ‘after’:
(108)       pae     m-atiah      ania       m-arak   pae
            twosome 3U-make-love each.other 3U-empty twosome
            m-e         m-amo amah
            3U-return 3U-go house
            ‘After the two have made love, they return to the house.’6.8.3.1 tipuo and fares
   The aspect adverbs tipuo ‘immediately, straight away’ and fares ‘still’ are discussed
separately, because they are syntactically more mobile and semantically more diverse than
the other aspect adverbs.
   The adverb tipuo ‘immediately, straight away’ is similar to the other aspect adverbials
in that it can occur in clause-final position, as in examples (109)–(110) or preceding the
object. In both positions, the scope of tipuo is over the entire clause that it belongs to.
(109)       m-amo Kokas tipuo
            3U-go Kokas immediately
            ‘She immediately goes to Kokas.’
(110)       t-hai   awiah, t-ait    po-iit        tipuo
            1S-die taro      1S-eat thing-eat.P immediately
            ‘I am hungy, and I immediately eat food.’
(111)       ana m-no po        ø-sre,    ait y-atak       tipuo         ana
            3P 3U-do thing ø-wrong 3M 3M-angry immediately 3P
            ‘They did something wrong, and he gets angry with them straight away.’
(112)       t-amo Kumurkek, t-amo tipuo              Kokas
            1S-go Kumurkek 1S-go straight.away Kokas
            ‘I go to Kumurkek, and to Kokas straight after that.’
            (i.e. I won’t come to Ayawasi before going to Kokas)
     It is unclear whether there is a semantic difference between the following two forms:
(113)       ø-skie amah s-au     tipuo
            ø-build house one-3U immediately
14
     It is difficult to prove the difference between the use of fo as an aspect adverbial and fo as a clausal
     determiner (see §6.10).
160     Chapter 6         ø-skie tipuo          amah s-au
         ø-build immediately house one-3U
         ‘They immediately built a house.’
   Unlike other aspect adverbials, tipuo can also occur in clause-initial position. In this
position, tipuo must precede the subject NP. The scope of tipuo is over the entire clause
that it belongs to. Some examples follow:
(114)    tipuo       ait y-ros       y-amo p-ait
         immediately 3M 3M-stand 3M-go EMPH-3M
         ‘He immediately got up and went on his own.’
(115)    y-ata,     tipuo       y-rof        y-fat
         3M-drink immediately 3M-follow 3M-fell
         ‘He drank, and he immediately followed (them) and felled (a tree).’
(116)    tipuo        rae    ø-srohni, m-awe t-arak        t-hai
         Immediately person ø-forget 3U-say 1S-empty 1S-dead
         ‘The people immediately forgot me, they thought I was gone, dead.’
   The aspect adverbial fares ‘still’ is invariably located in clause-final position. Some
examples are:
(117)    iwai      y-no    honor            fares
         earlier 3M-do honorary.tasks still
         ‘Earlier, he was still doing his honorary tasks.’15
(118)    tuo sia16 t-ao             iwai      ø-farkor fares
         1S with 1S-sibling.SS earlier ø-study still
         ‘I with my brother, formerly we still studied.’
(119)    t-hu     mpair ro rae            m-oa            fares
         1S-stay place REL person 3U-not.know still
         ‘I stayed at a place that people still don’t know.’
   The aspect adverb fares can combine with other forms in fixed expressions. First, fares
is often preceded by a form of the verb -etu ‘still be’ to form the idiomatic expression
m-etu fares ‘it is still’:
(120)    on r-au            m-etu        fares
         time POSS-3U 3U-still.be still
         ‘Its time is still continuing.’
(121)    Paulince m-haf            m-etu  fares
         Paulince 3U-pregnant 3U-still.be still
         ‘Paulince is still pregnant.’15
   Doing an honor implies working without a contract, and receiving an honorary payment rather than a
   salary.

   In this comitative form, a person prefix t- ‘1S’ is omitted. See §8.5 on comitative forms for more
   examples.

            Mister teacher 3M-stay Sorong 3M-still.be still
            ‘The teacher is still in Sorong.’
     A second common expression is tna fares ‘only recently’. Some examples are:
(123)       m-ros     tna       fares
            3U-stand recently still
            ‘She got up only recently.’
(124)       m-ape          m-aku17 tna         fares
            3U-give.birth 3U-small recently still
            ‘She gave birth to small ones only recently.’
   The adverb fares is frequently combined with the negator fe ‘NEG’to form fe fares ‘not
yet’. An example is:
(125)       m-e      pitis   fe   fares
            3U-give money NEG still
            ‘She has not given money yet.’
     This expression is discussed in more detail in §6.9.4.","[169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179]"

    Because the head of the NP is rae, referring to a male, as appears from the person prefix y- further on in
    the sentence, the form expected here is s-ait, as there should be agreement for gender between the head
    noun and the numeral modifier ‘one’ (see §4.6). It is not clear why s-au, the unmarked form, is used here.

   Some more examples are given below: in examples (6) and (7) mati occurs within a
sentence (that is preceded by a rising intonation), and in (8) and (9) it occurs between
sentences (that is preceded by a falling (clause-final) intonation):
(6)        tein              s-au     marák      / mati        p-he     Pastòr /

    Here anu ‘2P’ is used to exclude the interviewers (W. Avé and myself) from the description given. A
    second person plural form is often used in this context, see for instance lines 64, 77 and 82 in text fnia
    mkiar (Appendix II).

    The verb ø-samer refers to items that are hot enough for using, be it consumption (food can be ‘ø-samer’)
    or, as is the case in this example, hot enough to roast things.
                                                                             Complex constructions 225            nini-nina         saì / p-hu          nina ru     m-amà
            pitchdark-REDUP only         1P-stay dark bird 3U-come
            ‘We immediately enjoyed this,4 we always stayed and heard the aeroplane.
            And then we became acquainted with the radio, formerly we just lived in
            the dark.5 We lived in the dark and the aeroplane came.’
   A second use of mati is to link an NP or an adverbial and a clause. In this position, the
NP or adverbial then functions as a verbless clause, that is it has the same intonational
characteristics as clauses that occur in this position. Consider, for instance, example (10),
where the NP ana m-ana tuf ‘the three of them’ functions as a verbless clause:
(10)        ana m-ana  túf / mati     m-po    tapam tuoh
            3P 3U-head three and.then 3U-hold land place
            we-f-ò
            location.GEN-very.near-U
            ‘The three of them, they took (developed) the land in this place.’
   In this context, the function of mati is to emphasise the previous NP. For example, (11b)
is an informative statement. In contrast with (11b), (11a) was found in a context where
Wuon (the initiation of men) was compared to fnia m-kiar (the ‘education’ of women).6
The question was whether pofit (‘ginger’) played a role in fnia m-kiar. The answer was
negative, after which a comparison with Wuon was given in the form of (11a). The comma
in the translation is given to indicate the emphasis on the word Wuon (as opposed to fnia
m-kiar).
(11) a.     Wuon / rae        mati     m-ait pofit        m-siar
            Wuon       person and.then 3U-eat ginger 3U-many
            ‘As for the men of Wuon, they eat lots of ginger.’
       b.   Wuon / rae       m-ait pofit m-siar
            Wuon     person 3U-eat ginger 3U-many
            ‘In Wuon the people eat lots of ginger.’
   Below, temporal adverbials are linked to a clause by mati. Again, the function of mati is
to emphasise the adverbial. A contrast between forms with and without mati is given in
example (12): in (12a) mati specifies that it has to be evening first, and only then will a
man go out to kill (everyone). In (12b) this emphasis is absent.
(12) a.     mti      mati      y-ehoh m-arak
            night and.then 3M-stab 3U-empty
            ‘At night, only then did he slay them all.’
            (lit. ‘He stabbed (and killed) and they were gone.’)
       b.   mti    y-ehoh m-arak
            night 3M-stab 3U-empty
            ‘At night he slayed them all.’4
    ‘This’ refers to the new situation, i.e. the newly-built airstrip.
5
    ‘The dark’ is a figure of speech to refer to the isolated circumstances that people lived in before the radio
    was introduced.
6
    Fnia ‘woman’ and m-kiar ‘she decorates’. M-kiar refers to the decorations that women receive when they
    are introduced into womanhood. See Appendix II for the complete text.
226     Chapter 9  Some more examples involving the temporal adverbials snie September follow in (13)
and Hari Minggu s-au fe eok in (14):
(13)       snie      September mati       ru     m-roh
           month September and.then bird 3U-descend
           ‘The aeroplane will land (here) in the month September.’
           (lit. ‘The month September, and then the aeroplane will descend.’)
(14)       Hari Minggu s-au fe          eok mati          t-ama
           {Sunday}         one-U NEG two and.then 1S-come
           ‘I will come in one or two weeks.’ (lit. ‘One or two Sundays, and then I come.’)
    In example (15), the locative adverbial to-tis functions like a verbless clause:
(15)       to-tis      mati    Sosonwawa ø-frok         ø-skie amah r-ait
           LOC-behind and.then Sosonwawa ø-emerge ø-build house POSS-3M
           ‘Lastly, Sosonwawa emerged and built his house.’9.1.1.2 The coordinator na
   Like mati, the coordinator na indicates sequentiality of actions, but it is not as explicit
as mati. Some speakers use it very frequently, others don’t use it at all. Its status is like that
of a gap-filler. In examples (16) and (17) na occurs between clauses, that is, it is preceded
by rising intonation and a (small) pause. In this position, the function of na is parallel to
that of mati indicating sequentiality between clauses (cf. (4)–(6) above). In (18) and (19)
na links two sentences, that is, it is preceded by a falling intonation. Here, it functions like
mati in sentence-initial position, see (8) and (9).
(16)       m-aút     / na        m-kai     apàn    /

    Na is ‘pangium edule sp.’. Nna ‘pangium edule sp.’ which is homophonous with na ‘and then’.
                                                                 Complex constructions 227           Henky: ‘And then this na fell from above, it went down and hit the ground
           kangaroos who were just then picking up the na below.’ Waisafo: ‘Many
           ground kangaroos perished.’ Henky: ‘Then they (i.e. the people) got up
           and lifted them (the ground kangaroos), and at night they (the people) carried
           them (home).’

           3U-come immediately and.then
           ‘The man, he held her hand too. Then they stood and they went.’
  Like mati, na can also be preceded by an adverbial functioning like a verbless clause.
Some examples are:
(20)       t-hu       sai t-amo sai t-no po            sai. Mti na            t-ama    t-tien
           1S-stay just 1S-go just 1S-do thing just night and.then 1S-come 1S-sleep
           ‘I just lived (there) and I just went and did things. At night, I came and slept.’
(21)       mah     rapu    na       rae    tkia iso s-au     m-ama
           sunrise morning and.then person place road one-3U 3U-come
           ø-srar u
           ø-dance again
           ‘The following morning, people from one area came and danced again.’
   Lastly, as already indicated in (19), na can also occur in sentence-final position. In this
position, na is typically a gap-filler. It is included in the sentence-final intonation contour
of the sentence, and is directly followed by a pause. The coordinator na in sentence-final
position occurs in cases where consecutive events are recounted. An example:
(22)       m-amo ø-frok   amah nà      / ait y-ros   y-pies   au
           3U-go ø-emerge house and.then 3M 3M-stand 3M-order 3U
           m-amo m-atu          awiàh /
           3U-go 3U-yank.out taro
           ‘They went and emerged from the house. He stood and ordered her to
           go and yank out some taro.’9.1.1.3 The coordinator m-nan
   When m-nan functions as a main verb it means ‘it is enough’, ‘it is finished’, ‘it is
similar to’. An example follows:
(23)       y-o     po               ewók           / y-o     tfo
           3M-take ceremonial.cloth two              3M-take machete
           ewók / y-se          te-t-o        m-nàn
           two       3M-place below-near-U 3U-enough
           ‘He took two ceremonial cloths and he took two machetes and he placed
           them there and that was it.’8
    See below for na in sentence-final position.
228       Chapter 9   Here, m-nan is dominated by clause-final intonation.
   When m-nan functions as a coordinator, it occurs in clause-initial position, that is it is
preceded by a pause, and the clause-final intonation of the preceding clause. Here, m-nan
indicates explicitly that the previous action has been completed before the following action
begins. The most accurate English rendering of m-nan in this function is ‘after that’. An
example is:
(24)        ana m-amo Soróng           / m-nan     ana m-e       m-ama
            3P 3U-go Sorong              3U-enough 3P  3U-return 3U-come
            pe-f-o                 ù
            area.ADV-very.near-U again
            ‘They are going to Sorong. After that they will return and come here again.’
   The verb m-nan ‘it is finished, it is enough’ and the coordinator m-nan ‘after that’ are
homophonous. Given the semantic similarity, it is possible that the coordinator m-nan and
the verbal form m-nan are morphologically the same.
   In (25) an example contrasting the presence vs. the absence of m-nan is given. M-nan
makes explicit that the event described in the first clause (that is m-aku fo m-anes ‘these
small ones are old’) should be completed before that in the second clause (that is m-ataf
‘they are ripe’) occurs. In (25b) this sequentiality is not explicit: in fact, the events
described in the juxtaposed clauses may co-occur.
(25) a.     m-aku    f-o             m-anes m-nan          m-ataf
            3U-small very.near-U 3U-old 3U-enough 3U-ripe
            ‘These small ones (i.e. fruit) should be old enough before they are ripe.’
       b.   m-aku      f-o           m-anes m-ataf
            3U-small very.near-U 3U-old 3U-ripe
            ‘The small ones are old and ripe.’
   When linking two clauses, m-nan is often followed by the coordinator na, as in
examples (26) and (27):
(26)        ø-skie amah, ø-skie amah m-nan        na       kumpul
            ø-build house ø-build house 3U-enough and.then collect

            wine, meat, and they came and made a feast at that place.’
(27)        y-men    m-nan     na       m-o     wan9

    Wan is the name of a type of ceremonial cloth. The two wan mentioned in this example, wan Faserim and
    wan Yu Rhat are used as items for exchange in marriage.

             ‘He looked and he observed and after that two of us descended.’
   As was the case for mati and na, m-nan as a coordinator can also occur in sentence-
initial position, as illustrated in examples (29)–(31) below:
(29)         m-nan     to-tis     mati     m-ros    m-ape

             ‘And at the back (lastly), she stood and gave birth to Anton, who now
             works at the “BPD” office in Manokwari.’

             woman Ais and submerged her. And then he stands and does (it) likewise again.’
(31)         tapam re-t-o               m-akuo / m-nan     m-afan

             ‘They made a feast at this place. And then they gave a name to this place,
             its name was Tuoh Pokuo.’9.1.2 Enumeration
   In §4.11, I introduced the enumerator o, which can link NPs (see §5.6) and clauses. The
form o signals that a clause is part of an enumeration. Every clause in an enumeration takes
o, although the last clause sometimes does not.1210
     It is not clear what the function of this element is. I suspect it is just a gap-filler, like ‘uh’.
11
     Literally tuoh pokuo is <place NOM-feast.P> ‘the place of the feast’.
230       Chapter 9   Intonationally, o occurs in clause-final position, since it is followed by a pause.
However, unlike a falling pitch which typically marks the end of a clause, the pitch on o
remains level (marked by a bar over the vowel), and the vowel is phonetically long. Some
examples follow:
(32)        na        m-kuk intape ō         / m-kuk ara ō
            and.then 3U-pull rope ENUM          3U-pull tree ENUM
            ‘Then he pulled a rope and he pulled at a tree.’

            harta       ro-aù13
            brideprice POSS-3U
            ‘Under his arm he carried things and he took them, he carried beads and
            he carried whatever for her brideprice under his arm.’9.1.3 Disjunction
   The negator fe may function as a coordinator marking disjunction. It can only occur
within a sentence. The use of a negator to mark disjunction is attested in other languages as
well (for example in Kresh, a Central-Sudanic Nilo-Saharan language, Brown 1994).
   When fe functions as a disjunctive coordinator (glossed ‘DISJ’), it patterns with the other
coordinators in terms of intonation (with the exception of the enumerator o, see above),
that is it occurs in clause-initial position. The pitch of the preceding clause rises on the
final syllable, to signal that there is more to come. An example is given in (34a) below.
Conversely, when fe functions as a negator, it is included in the (falling) intonation contour
of the first clause, and it is followed by a pause, viz. (34b):
(34) a.     p-mo Aisa wiá / fe           p-mo Aynesra wià
            1P-go Aisa first      DISJ 1P-go Aynesra first
            ‘Shall we go to Aisa first or Shall we go to Aynesra first?’
       b.   p-mo Aisa wia fè           / p-mo Aynesra wià
            1P-go Aisa first NEG           1P-go Aynesra first
            ‘We will not go to Aisa first. We will go to Aynesra first.’
   Some examples of disjunctive coordination are given in (35) and (36). In (36) fe
functions as a disjunctive coordinator, whereas m-fe functions as a predicative negator.
(35)        anu n-he n-we          fi-ye? m-kair fe         m-of
            2P 2P-see 2P-say.P like-INT 3U-bad DISJ 3U-good
            ‘You look at it and what do you think? Is it bad or good?’
12
     When o links NPs, o on the last NP is also not obligatory (see §5.6).
13
     Usually in possessive forms, the vowel on ro is reduced if the following morpheme is vowel-initial (see
     §3.4).
                                                                             Complex constructions 231(36)       tapi ana m-fot        fane ro m-aku iye fe m-fe   a
           but 3P 3U-catch pig REL 3U-small also DISJ 3U-NEG INT
           ‘But did they catch the piglet too, or not?’
     The negator fe can also mark inclusive disjunction in enumerations, as illustrated below:
(37)       m-roh      tipuo       me-au        na       n-amo n-mat    ana
           3U-descend immediately PRESTT-U.DIS and.then 2-go 2-observe 3P
           te-au         / wehati fe   matiaf           fe    tfo ø-ftah14
           area.N-U.DIST   ?15    DISJ bird.of.paradise DISJ {ceremonial machete}           fe     wan          / rae          m-ti
           DISJ ceremonial.cloth person 3U-carry
           ‘They immediately descended there, and you went and observed them there,
           people carried wehati or a bird of paradise or a ceremonial machete or ceremonial
           cloth.’16
9.1.4 Purpose
   The coordinator re ‘in order to’ introduces a purpose clause. Intonationally, re belongs
to the clause expressing purpose, and it occurs in clause-initial position. A purpose clause
follows the clause which describes the action which is undertaken to effectuate the
intention expressed in the purpose clause. Some examples follow:
(38)       t-amo amah ø-kiyám / re                  suster m-he         t-aò
           1S-go house ø-ill          in.order.to sister 3U-see 1S-foot
           ‘I am going go to the hospital in order for the sister to look at my foot.’
(39)       m-awe n-amo n-apot    ara ø-hri aro     n-amá                            /
           3U-say 2-go 2-collect tree ø-bark other 2-come
           re          p-tu    aòf
           in.order.to 1P-pour sago
           ‘She said, “You go and collect treebark and other things in order for
           us to pour sago.”’
(40)       t-amo orá       / re           orie mti      p-iit    ara sasù
           1S-go garden in.order.to later night 1P-eat.P {cassava}
           ‘I will go to the garden so that tonight we eat cassava.’
     In the following sentence the temporal adverb m-orie functions as a verbless clause:
(41)       ait y-awe: m-orié            / re            aya    m-yuòh
           3M 3M-say 3U-later              in.order.to water 3U-boil
           ‘He said, “In a little while, in order for the water to boil.”’14
     Tfo ftah is a big machete with a decorated blade. It is used in traditional ceremonies and was formerly
     used as a bride-price.
15
     Wehati is a ceremonial item, but it is not clear what it refers to. The informant I translated this text with
     said it was no longer used.
16
     In this sentence the object, i.e. the enumerated NPs, is topicalised (see §6.6).
232    Chapter 9   It is possible that the coordinator re is related to the demonstrative prefix re-
‘location.SPEC’. The pragmatic function of the coordinator re may be interpreted as
marking a ‘topic’, or a ‘given’ according to which an action is carried out. Coordinators
that mark semantic categories such as purpose, cause, reason or conditionals often derive
from demonstrative elements, as attested in many languages. Some examples from
Germanic languages are the Old English coordinator for þaem ‘for that, because’ (Traugott
1985:297), English coordinator so that; the Dutch coordinator omdat ‘because, as’
containing dat ‘that’; and daarom and daardoor ‘therefore, so’ both containing the
demonstrative daar ‘there’. In a broad pragmatic sense each of these coordinators mark the
preceding clause as a ‘given’ in the discourse.","[241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250]"
"9.4.1 Tail-head linkage
    In tail-head linkage, the last predicate, sometimes including its nominal constituents, is
repeated as an introduction to the next sentence. It is a common feature in narratives in
Papuan (and Austronesian) languages, see, for instance Reesink (1990:301).
    In Maybrat, there are two types of tail-head linkage. In the first, a verb and its
constituents are repeated in the next sentence. Intonationally, in the repeated portion the
pitch at the end rises sharply, and a pause follows. In the following examples, instances of
tail-head linkage appear underlined:
(92)     rae    m-fot    m-po    m-amò / m-po    m-amó                       /
         person 3U-catch 3U-hold 3U-go   3U-take 3U-go
        ø-skie amah m-se          ait y-hù /
        ø-build house 3U-place 3M 3M-stay
        ‘The people caught (him) and they took him away. They took him away,
        they built a house and they place him (in it) and he lived (there).’
(93)     m-po m-ama m-tie         ita m-anes m-wau                     /
         3U-hold 3U-come 3U-break leaf 3U-old 3U-roast
         m-wau / eok m-as, m-i-ø-sasie                      m-se        /
         3U-roast        two 3U-lift 3U-TRANS-ø-wrap 3U-place
         ‘They hold it (a snake) and they come and break an old leaf and they
         roast it (i.e. the snake). They roast it and the two lift it (out of the fire),
         they wrap it and place it.’
   In the example below, the repeated portion is modified by m-arak ‘it is finished’, which
has an adverbial function in this position (see §6.8.3).
(94)     m-aut    na       m-kai apàn / m-kai apan m-arák
         3U-climb and.then 3U-find snake 3U-find snake 3U-finished
         ana eok m-ehòh           /
         3P    two 3U-hit
         ‘They climb (into a tree) and they find a snake. After they’ve found
         the snake, the two hit it.’
   In example (95) a portion of a narrative where tail-head linkage is used to link every
sentence is given:
242    Chapter 9(95)     ø-frok   m-hu sai amah m-api                 /   m-hu    amah

         ø-fluent ENUM immediately 3M-old
         ‘She arrives and just lives at the big house. She lives at the big house and
         she lives there for a long time and the child’s umbilical cord comes off and
         she still lives there and she lives there for a long time and the child gets older.
         He gets older and he crawls, he stands, he toddles, he walks well, and then
         he is grown up.’
   The second type of tail-head linkage is where a nominal constituent is repeated. The
function of this type of linking is to emphasise this constituent, in order for the listener to
keep track of the story. Tail-head linkage of this type is frequently used in histories about a
sequence of moves people made, as in example (96), and in genealogies, as in (97):

   When telling stories, a speaker may emphasise an action that he describes by repeating a
word a number of times. Intonationally, these sentences have regular sentence-final
intonation. The repeated words are pronounced in a rhythmic manner, at a level-tone
intonation, that is there is no fall or rise.23 An example follows:
(98)        ana m-amó m-amó m-amó m-amó
            3P 3U-go 3U-go 3U-go 3U-go
            ‘They go for a very long time.’
Some more examples are:
(99)        mah           rapu    y-ros    y-amo tipuo       y-amo y-amo

            ‘The following morning he gets up and immediately leaves, he walks
            for a long time from here, he goes for a long time and he sleeps and then
            he goes to the shore, he goes.’

            ø-emerge Fait Kawa ø-emerge Fokon Fumes23
     Sometimes, when expressing a lot of emphasis, the pitch rises, followed by a small cough after the final
     word. This is often followed by a single utterance m-nan ‘it is enough’.

               Asal usul fam Tenau ‘The origins of the Lineage1 Tenau’
   This is the history of the lineage Tenau, the lineage that originally inhabited the area
where now Ayawasi is situated. It was told by Waisafo Tenau (wt) and Henky Tenau (h),
two village elders. Both are approximately 60 years of age. Waisafo Tenau’s mother
originally came from Aytinyo, where the dialect of Mayte is spoken (see §1.7), and
Wasafo lived there for a long time. Some forms in the text that he uses are dialectal, I have
indicated these.
   In this history, the syntactic structure of Maybrat is amply illustrated: there are many
sequences of verbs. In the translations, I have attempted to retain some of this structure by
translating the sequences as literally as possible. Where this yielded very odd English
translations, I have made stylistic changes. As a result, many of these sequences are
translated as compound verbs, or constructions involving auxiliary verbs in English. These
translations, however, say nothing about the internal structure of the Maybrat verb
sequences. For a full discussion on Maybrat verb sequences, see Chapter 8.
   This text is a transcription of a recording. The recording was made at a house in
Ayawasi using a walkman and a separate microphone. The text was transcribed with the
help of Petrus Turot. In this text some phonemic features have been marked, that is pauses
and rises and falls in pitch. A description of these features is given in §2.7. The symbols
used are as follows (see also the ‘conventions’):
           # : long pause, typically marking the end of a sentence
           /:     short pause, typically marking a small break in mid-sentence
           grave accent ( › ) over a vowel:       falling pitch
           acute accent ( ´ ) over a vowel:       rising pitch
           bar ( ¯ ) over vowels in a sequence: allegro speech

2
     It is not clear why here a second person subject prefix n- is used. Since this form was consistently
     translated as a first person plural form, one would expect the form p-tat ‘our forefathers’.
3
     This is an example of a typical sequence of verbs, involving three verbs.
4
     There are some long pauses in this sentence. Because it was the beginning of the story, Waisafo Tenau
     was a little hesitant. These long pauses in the middle of the sentence are preceded by a rising intonation,
     marking that more is to follow, i.e. that the sentence is not yet finished. Other examples in this text are in
     lines 6, 9, etc.
5
     The Indonesian form terus is used regularly in Maybrat as a coordinator (see also lines 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 21,
     50, 73). A corresponding Maybrat alternative is m-nan ‘afterwards’, for instance used in line 7.
6
     It is not clear why here a masculine form is used. This may be because the referents of re-t-i ‘this’ are the
     possessions of a masculine human. Other instances of re-t-i occur in line 5 and in line 30.
7
     From here to the end of sentence 5 Waisafo Tenau speaks fast, with only small pauses between sentences.
     Often when the Maybrat speak from memory they speak fast, and in a steady rhythm.
8
     This is an instance of tail-head linkage, where the last portion of line 4, y-amo y-hu Tenau Rarir, is
     repeated at the beginning of the next sentence (see §9.4.1).
9
     The function of the repetition of Rarir is to emphasise that the ‘forefather’ lived at Tenau Rarir for a long
     time (see §9.4.2). A repetition with a similar meaning, involving the verb m-hu ‘they live’ occurs in line
     48.

            ‘At this place they feasted.’
10
   Here Waisafo makes a large pause. This pause marks that something new follows, namely an explanation
   of where Tenau Unepu is located.
11
   As opposed to lines 3 and 4, where terus ‘and then’ expresses a sequentiality in time, here terus marks an
   ordering in the explanation.
12
   Tiaran is a phonologically adapted form of jalan [»djalan] (see §2.8). See also this section for other
   phonologically adapted forms indicated in this text.
13
   The generic demonstrative form we-t-o is used to modify amah ‘house’ because the house no longer
   existed at the time the story was told, and could therefore not be specified. Conversely, in the following
   line, the specific form re-t-o is used to modify tuoh ‘place’, since the place still exists, and can be
   specified.
14
   This form is phonologically adapted from Ind. kumpul [»kumpul].
15
   In this form, the plural stem of the verb -akuo ‘feast’ is prefixed with the nominaliser po to derive a noun
   (see §4.3.4).

   At this point one would expect the name of the place i.e Tuoh Pokuo. The speaker is speaking very
   quickly here; possibly he can’t think of the name of the place quickly enough, and has to repeat the
   sentence before he remembers the name.
17
   This is the first mention of the name of the forefather.
18
   From here to the end of line 16 the speech is allegro, therefore the pauses are also relatively short.
19
   In this sentence and in the following sentence, the speaker makes use of tail-head linkage, whereby only
   the object of the previous sentence is repeated (see §9.4.1).
20
   At this point up to line 20 Waisafo was a little hesitant, marked by the insertion of pauses and dropping
   pitch at the end of clauses. The hesitation is possibly due to the fact that he has to remember the next bit of
   the story.
21
   Here m-nan functions as a verb meaning ‘it is enough’ (see §9.1.1.3).

              ‘They returned and lived at the house.’
22
      This form is phonologically adapted from Ind. bilang [»bilaN].
23
      The verbal form -mai is adequately translated as ‘speak a language’, i.e. t-mai Maybrat ‘I speak the
      Maybrat language’; ‘My language is Maybrat’.
24
      At the beginning of the interview, I had asked Waisafo and Henky Tenau to speak Maybrat, and not
      Indonesian. Here, Waisafo Tenau switches to Indonesian, and he is immediately corrected by Henky
      Tenau. The same occurs in lines 64–67 below. The insertion of the occasional Indonesian word was not
      commented on.
25
      The verb ø-frok literally means ‘to emerge’.
26
      Here the speaker speaks rapidly, resulting in the omission of a pause in clause-final position. Later in the
      same line, some pauses are inserted.

27
   The verb -afit in this context refers to hunting. It is used for animals, as they hunt by biting their prey. For
   hunting by humans the term -usiah is used, e.g. in line 56.
28
   In this sentence m-tut is used as a substantive, and functions as the subject of a clause (see also m-tut in
   line 27). This contrasts with m-tut in the following sentence, where it functions as a modifier.
29
   Here the object of the clause, Tuoh Pokuo, has been topicalised (see §6.6).
30
   The quantifying verbs m-tut and prut both modify the RC (see §4.2.2.3 on quantifying verbs). It is
   uncommon that two modifiers of the same word class modify an NP (see §5.1.2).
31
   This is an instance of kayie functioning as a ‘semantic negative’ (see §4.7.5 and §6.9.5).
32
   There are a number of occurrences of the temporal adverb orie with a subject prefix m- in the data. It is
   unclear what the semantic difference is between this form and, for instance, orie re.
33
   Here Waisafo is irritated that Henky interrupts him. This is marked in the utterance by a sharply rising and
   falling pitch. Waisafo reacts by speaking very fast in the next sentence, thus preventing Henky from
   interrupting again.
34
   The meaning and function of mi are unclear here.

   This form was pronounced by Waisafo Tenau as [s´n»diri], i.e. with a voiced stop [d]. Many older people
   in Ayawasi cannot pronounce voiced stops, and would render this form as [sEn»tiri]. As mentioned above,
   Waisafo Tenau’s speech was influenced by his mother’s, who used a southern dialect. In southern dialects
   (Maymaru and Mayte, see §1.7), voiced stops are used.

           Tenau illustrated how the dog was held) and they examined the dog’s teeth.’
36
   Again a masculine form is used (see line 5).
37
   The form mere ‘and then’ is unattested in Ayawasi. It is possibly a dialectal form from Mayte.
38
   In this form, a location marker like m-ae ‘at’ or to ‘LOC’ would be expected.
39
   Sipuk is selaginella sp, a grass-like plant.
40
   Henky Tenau illustrated how the grass got stuck between the dog’s teeth. In line 36 Waisafo Tenau does
   the same.

   That is, the dog hunted on the ground, and the selaginalla sp was so long that it automatically got stuck
   between the dog’s teeth whenever it bit a cuscus.

44
   Between y-roh and y-amo one would expect a pause, as this is a clause-boundary. However, the speech
   here is allegro, and the pause is omitted. The same holds for line 45, which also contains no pauses.
45
   Mukete is [«muk´»te] phonetically. Possibly this is a compound noun, consisting of Muk, the name of a
   place, and ete ‘below’.
46
   The spatial noun m-air ‘foot of tree’ refers conceptually to ‘the beginning’ in terms of time.

   Here Waisafo Tenau hesitated because he couldn’t think of the name Kohmaro quickly enough. Once he
   did, however, he said it twice, without a pause in between.
48
   From here up to line 55 there are hardly any pauses.
49
   The long pause here marks the introduction of a new topic, namely the move to Tenau Mukete.
50
   Here na functions as a gap-filler (see §9.1.1.2).
51
   The presentative prefix me- is used because Henky Tenau pointed out to Avé and myself where the people
   hunted. See §4.4.2 for presentative forms.
52
   The verb -sia expresses a comitative. Following a subject (here the third person unmarked subject prefix
   on the verb m-amo ‘They go’) this verb is adequately translated as ‘take along for hunting’. See also §8.4.

56
   This is an instance where a predicative form m-fe ‘it is not’ is to be expected, since m-fe is used primarily
   to negate an NP (see §6.9.2). In §6.9.3, I indicate that a distinction between the clausal negator fe and the
   predicative negator m-fe cannot always be maintained, since there seem to be a substantial number of
   exceptions. This is one of these exceptions.

   The Indonesian language is referred to by older people as mai Tuan, lit. the language of the ‘mister’
   (<Tuan ‘mister’, a term of address for a man of higher social rank). These ‘misters’ include the (Dutch)
   Missionaries, who lived in Ayawasi for a long time, and the Indonesian civil servants and Missionaries.
58
   Given the imperative mood of this utterance, it is unclear why here fe ‘NEG’ instead of mai ‘PROHIB’ is
   used.

   Na is pangium edule sp, an edible fruit, common in Ayawasi. In Indonesian it is referred to as Buah Raja
   (see line 80).
60
   This description is reminiscent of those of ‘the land of milk and honey’.
61
   Henky got annoyed with the fact that Waisafo spilled the beans. Apparently Henky had planned to tell this
   later on in the story.
62
   This is possibly an onomatopoeic form, reflecting the continuous walking in the forest. It is the only
   attestation in the data.
63
   This sentence is illustrative of the fact that in Maybrat subjects and objects need not be expressed, and
   omitting these does not render an utterance ungrammatical. All the subjects and objects (the na, the cuscus

64
   In this sentence Waisafo remembers that there were son ‘coconuts’ as well, and he mentions them before
   he starts the actual sentence.
65
   Here the speaker remembers that he forgot to mention coconuts in the preceding sentence.
66
   Here another clause is added to make explicit that people travelled back to Tenau Koru, since re-au, in the
   previous clause, is not clear enough.
67
   In the dry season there is less water in the rivers, and it is easy to catch catfish. People catch them either
   by stabbing them with spears, or by catching them with their hands.
68
   What follows is a quote, hence the pause (see §8.3). Another direct quote occurs in line 116. In pseudo-
   quotatives, such a pause is not present (cf. lines 111–112).

   Here an enumeration is made where each NP is separated by a pause. Alternatively, the enumerator o
   could have been used (see §4.11; the same is true for line 92).
70
   The use of the adverb sai ‘just’ indicates that no objections can possibly be made to the new ground.
71
   I am unable to reconstruct ktan mata. From the context it can be concluded that mata is a part of the taro
   plant that they did not need to take along with them. Syntactically, ktan is a verb (cf. t-se war (<-se
   ‘place’) ‘I reject it’).
72
   That is, the people cut off the small shoots that grow around the big taro plant and throw these away (Avé
   pers. comm.).

   Apit m-asuf ‘the banana’s middle’ is an example of a possessive construction where the order of the
   constituents is possessor-possessed, and the possessed (m-asuf, the middle) is a spatial noun. Spatial nouns
   are classified as inalienably possessed nouns (see §4.3.1).
74
   Kerompok is a phonologically adapted form of kelompok [k´»lçmpçk].
75
   He again refers to the ironwood tree near Petrus’ house (see line 57).
76
   Possibly, this is a form including the derivative morpheme -i- ‘TRANS’, which changes the valency of the
   verb (see §4.2.4). In this form *ø-wrek may mean ‘cross over’, so that -i-ø-wrek means ‘cross over
   something’.
77
   This form is not phonologically adapted by Henky, who has no problem pronouncing [tS] in [»katSAN].
   Some older people pronounce it as [»kasAN].
78
   At the time the story was told, someone had just made a peanut garden at Fra Mukete, which Henky refers
   to in order to point out the exact location.

     This is an instance where the focus adverb si ‘also’ occurs once in clause-final position. It may also occur
     twice, expressing simultaneity (see §9.1.6).

                             Fnia m-kiar ‘Women who are decorated’
   This interview was recorded in collaboration with Wanda Avé, ethnobotanist, in
Ayawasi in October 1995. The woman who was interviewed is Ais Mawe, approximately
45 years of age, who spoke very little Indonesian. The purpose of the interview was for
Avé to find out if there are any particular plants used by women, particularly during their
initiation. We asked Elisabeth Korain, 35 years old, and bilingual in Maybrat and
Indonesian, to attend the interview in order to translate and explain if necessary. While
Avé used the interview primarily for the botanical information that Ais Mawe gave, I used
the text as linguistic data. The botanical names of plants that are known are given in the
text. They are taken from the list compiled by Wanda Avé (1998), ‘Preliminary list of the
use of the plants of Ayawasi’.
   The recording was made at a house in Ayawasi, using a walkman and a separate
microphone. The text was later transcribed from the recording with the help of Elisabeth
Korain and her husband, Petrus Turot.
   Ais Mawe belongs to the lineage Turot, which originates from the area to the north of
Ayawasi. There are some instances in the following text which contain forms that are
unattested elsewhere. I have indicated these as possibly dialectal forms.
   Below, I have indicated pauses (‘ / ’) to make the syntactic structure more transparent.

     Kiyit is possibly a dialectal variant of kiet, the bark of a plant of the Ficus family. The kiet bark is hit with
     a hammer (a hpat, see next line), in order to make it softer so that they can use it as a garment. Kiyit also
     refers generically to garments (see line 12).
2
     The object hpat ‘hammer’ is topicalised (see §6.6). Other instances of topicalisation occur, for instance, in
     line 4 (po-kiar ‘decoration’); 14 (prat m-api s-au ‘one big waistband’); 23 (am ‘mat’); 31 and 32 (aya
     ‘water’).

"8.4 Prepositional notions
   In §4.2.3.5, I introduced four prepositional verbs, listed again below:
(86)       -ae        ‘at’
           -kit       ‘towards’
           -pat       ‘from’
           -kah       ‘with’/‘to’/‘for’
   I illustrated that only -ae ‘at’ can function as a main verb and that it may have a
defective paradigm; and that -kah invariably has a defective paradigm, and that these verbs
invariably occur with an object. I concluded that these verbs are less ‘verby’ than verbs
that can function as main verbs.
   In sequences of verbs, prepositional verbs are never the first verb in the sequence. Verb
sequences that involve these verbs are different from any of the other sequences discussed
so far. To begin with, all sequences allow a pause preceding the prepositional verb, but
rather than changing the meaning of the utterance, this merely shifts the emphasis of the
utterance to the prepositional verb and its object. For example, in (87b), the fact that people
go towards the sago tree (and not somewhere else) is emphasised. There is a rise in pitch
directly preceding the pause, but when the second verb is -ae, a fall in pitch is allowed, as
in (90c). This is because the verb -ae can function as a single-verb clause.
(87) a.    rae    m-siar     m-amo m-kit           aòf /
           person 3U-many 3U-go 3U-towards sago

          person 3U-many 3U-go       3U-towards sago
          ‘Many people go away, towards the sago tree.’
(88) a.   t-ama     t-pat   Soròng         /
          1S-come 1S-from Sorong
          ‘I came from Sorong.’
     b.   t-amá      / t-pat   Soròng          /
          1S-come      1S-from Sorong
          ‘I came, from Sorong.’
(89) a.   au m-kom am m-kah m-mè                   /
          3U 3U-write letter 3U-for 3U-mother
          ‘She writes a letter to/for her mother.’
     b.   au m-kom ám / m-kah m-mè /
          3U 3U-write letter 3U-for 3U-mother
          ‘She writes a letter, to/for her mother.’
(90) a.   t-amo t-ae amàh /
          1S-go 1S-at house
          ‘I went to stay in the house.’
     b.   t-amó / t-ae amàh /
          1S-go      1S-at house
          ‘I went, and (now) I’m at the house.’
     c.   t-amò / t-ae amàh /
          1S-go      1S-at house
          ‘I went, and (now) I’m at the house.’
   With the exception of sequences involving -ae, none of the sequences with prepositional
verbs allow insertion of the coordinator mati. If mati is inserted between -ae and a
preceding verb, this incurs a considerable change in meaning, as illustrated in (91b). In this
example, y-ae functions as a main verb. This shows that -ae still has many verbal
properties.
(91) a.   ait ø-frok       y-ae aof m-air
          3M ø-emerge 3M-at sago 3U-foot.of.tree
          ‘He arrived at the foot of the sago tree.’
     b.   ait ø-frok    mati      y-ae aof m-air
          3M ø-emerge and.then 3M-at sago 3U-foot.of.tree
          ‘He arrived and then he was at the foot of the sago tree.’
   The examples above illustrate clearly that the sequences involving -ae behave like
coordinating constructions, while sequences with other prepositional verbs do not.
   Taking the objects out of coordinating constructions, adverbial constructions and
constructions involving an object complement seems straightforward, being either possible
or impossible according to informants. However, taking the objects out of sequences
involving a prepositional verb is less straightforward: the objects of -kit, as in example
(92b), and -pat, as in example (93b), can be extracted without any problem:
206         Chapter 8(92) a.      rae    m-siar     m-amo m-kit           aof
             person 3U-many 3U-go 3U-towards sago.tree
             ‘Many people go towards the sago tree.’
       b.    aof ro rae          m-siar  m-amo m-kit         Ø m-hu rapuoh
             sago REL person 3U-many 3U-go 3U-towards            3U-stay forest
             ‘The sago tree that many people go towards is in the forest.’
(93) a.      t-ama     t-pat   Sorong
             1S-come 1S-from Sorong
             ‘I come from Sorong.’
       b.    Sorong ro t-ama       t-pat   Ø m-hu        m-ae sasu
             Sorong REL 1S-come 1S-from        3U-stay 3U-at coast
             ‘Sorong where I come from is on the coast.’
   A slightly different construction, where the verb -pat precedes the motion verb is given
in example (94a). A similar type of construction with -kit is not possible.
(94)         ait y-pat     rapuoh y-ama
             3M 3M-from forest 3M-come
             ‘He comes from the forest.’
   The behaviour (94) differs from constructions where the prepositional verb is preceded
by the motion verb. The differences are as follows: first, the entire utterance must be
dominated by one intonation contour. The presence of two intonation contours renders the
utterance ungrammatical, as shown in (95).
(95)         *ait y-pat  rapuóh / y-àma
              3M 3M-from forest   3M-come
   The second, most notable, difference with constructions where -pat precedes the motion
verb is in its behaviour under relativisation. Whereas relativisation on the object of -kit, as
in (92b) results in a grammatical construction, relativisation on the object of -pat results in
an anomalous construction, for example (96). I construed it myself, and some speakers
accepted it, but others quite resolutely rejected this sentence as unacceptable. In
spontaneous speech, this kind of construction is unattested.
(96)         ?rapuoh ro y-pat          y-ama     m-hu e
              forest   REL 3M-from 3M-come 3U-stay far
             ‘The forest from where he comes is far (away).’
   Unlike the objects of the verbs -pat and -kit, extracting the object of the verb m-kah in
the same manner is not allowed, as illustrated below:
(97)         *pam ro t-fat    ara m-kah m-api
              axe REL 1S-fell tree 3U-with 3U-big
    However, there is a way to relativise on the object of -kah. If in the relativised sentence
the order of the verbs is reversed so that the first verb is m-kah, and what was originally the
first verb follows m-kah, the resulting utterance is grammatical. This is illustrated in
examples (98)–(99), where -kah semantically expresses an instrumental, and in (100),
where it expresses a recipient/benefactive:
                                                                          Sequences of verbs      207(98) a.      t-fat      ara m-kah pam
             1S-fell tree 3U-with axe
             ‘I fell a tree with an axe.’
        b.   pam ro m-kah t-fat            ara ø-samuoh
             axe REL 3U-with 1S-fell tree ø-heavy
             ‘The axe with which I fell the tree is heavy.’
(99) a.      t-amus onfuk m-kah sabun
             1S-wash clothes 3U-with soap
             ‘I wash the clothes with soap.’
        b.   sabun ro m-kah t-amus onfuk m-poh
             soap REL 3U-with 1S-wash clothes 3U-white
             ‘The soap with which I wash clothes is white.’
(100) a.     ø-tim am        m-kah      ait
             ø-send letter 3U-to/for 3M
             ‘I’m sending a letter to/for him.’
        b.   ait ro m-kah Ø ø-tim am y-hu                   Sorong
             3M REL 3U-to         ø-send letter 3M-stay Sorong
             ‘He to/for whom I’m sending a letter lives in Sorong.’
    In other words, the fact that the object of -kah ‘with’/‘to’/‘for’ can be relativised on
illustrates that it is a different type of verb than -kit ‘towards’ and -pat ‘from’.
    The object of the verb -ae can be extracted without violating the grammaticality of the
utterances, as in example (101b):
(101) a.     t-ama     t-ae amah
             1S-come 1S-at house
             ‘I come to stay in the house.’
        b.   amah ro t-ama        t-ae Ø m-hu          kait amah ro-Petrus
             house REL 1S-come 1S-at        3U-stay close house POSS-Petrus
             ‘The house where I come to stay is close to Petrus’ house.’
   This type of extraction is very similar in form and behaviour to the constructions with
-kit ‘towards’ and -pat ‘from’, and to those with a complement, as discussed in §8.3.12
   However, there is a hitch, because sequences involving -ae do not always behave as
described above. The verb -ae also occurs with a third person unmarked prefix m-,
preceded by a verb with a different prefix. In this case, -ae has a defective paradigm. A
contrastive example in which -ae occurs with an unmarked prefix is given below:
(102) a.     t-amo t-ae amah
             1S-go 1S-at house
             ‘I go to stay in the house.’
        b.   t-amo m-ae amah
             1S-go 3U-at house
             ‘I go to the house.’12
     On the whole, constructions of the type ‘V+-ae’, where the verb -ae is declined are similar to the
     problematic constructions discussed in §8.7.
208      Chapter 8    Semantically, the two differ slightly: in example (102a) the verb -ae is adequately
translated as ‘to be at’, as indicated in the English translation. In (102b) m-ae has little
semantic content: its function is that of a pointer which marks the following NP as a
location. The difference between these two kinds of -ae has consequences for its
intonational and syntactic behaviour: a sequence of a verb followed by m-ae cannot be
dominated by two intonation contours without rendering the utterance ungrammatical,13 as
illustrated in (103). The same applies to insertion of the overt coordinator mati, as in (104).
(103)        *y-àmo / m-ae hanggàr
             3M-go    3U-at hanger
(104)        *ait y-amo     ø-frok   mati     m-ae aof m-air
             3M 3M-go       ø-emerge and.then 3U-go sago 3U-foot
   Likewise, ‘objects’ of defective-paradigm -ae cannot be relativised on, as illustrated in
examples (105b) and (106b).14
(105) a.      t-amo m-ae amah
              1S-go 3U-at house
              ‘I go to the house.’
        b.    *amah ro t-amo m-ae               Ø    m-hu Ayawasi
              house REL 1S-go 3U-at                  3U-stay Ayawasi
(106) a.      ana m-hu       m-ae Ayawasi
              3P 3U-stay 3U-at Ayawasi
              ‘They live in Ayawasi.’
        b.    *Ayawasi ro ana         m-hu m-ae Ø             m-of
              Ayawasi REL 3P          3U-stay 3U-at           3U-good
   It is clear from the above that -ae has two distinct syntactic functions. Whereas the
‘declining’ forms are similar to coordinating constructions, the defective paradigm
instances are different. I will return to the notion that a lexical item, like this defective-
paradigm verb -ae, is formally like a verb, but is functionally more like a preposition in the
following section.","[222, 223, 224, 225, 226]"

     This form may function as a single clause and is also translated as such, although in the corresponding
     example it is not. See also example (52).

          ‘He holds it and he climbs and shares it with the people.’2.5 Other phonetic features
   Many older speakers of Maybrat blow through their nose (marked ‘á’) at the end of a
sentence, as in (57). This movement seems to be completely arbitrary: it does not, for
instance, signal to the hearer that more is to come, or, conversely, that the speaker has
nothing more to say. ‘á’’s are well attested all over the Bird’s Head (for example Menick
pers. comm.; Odé pers. comm.; Reesink pers. comm.).

          ‘I with them’
   If forms ending in /t/ are uttered in isolation, or when they occur in sentence-final
position, the pronunciation of /t/ may be postponed, so that it is heard later than expected.
In such forms, there is a silence between the vowel and the word-final [t]:39
     [s´rAx»wata] behaves like a compound noun: the main stress is on the second member stress position,
     while the secondary stress is on the stressed syllable of the first member.

           ‘I eat.’
2.6 Some elliptic phenomena
   The description of the sounds of Maybrat so far has been based on slow (lento) speech.
In allegro speech, some elliptic phenomena, that is the reduction of certain vowels, occur,
which are listed below.
   In words containing three syllabic vowels, of which the second vowel is /i/ or /u/, there
is a tendency to reduce these vowels /i/ or /u/ to [j] or [w] respectively in allegro speech.
The result is that two syllables (or prominence peaks) instead of three are heard.40
Reduction of a syllable /i/ or /u/ only occurs within morphemes. Examples are given
below: (59) represents a word uttered in lento speech, and (60) represents the same word,
uttered in allegro speech.
(59)       syllable                            ơ            ơ            ơ           phonetic realisation        [»r    a      p      u      w      ç    x]

(60)       syllable                            ơ                    ơ           phonetic realisation        [»r     a     p      w      ç      x]

           phoneme-structure           /r      a     p      u      o      x/
40
     The physical correlates of these prominence peaks can be defined as intensity, duration and amplitude.
                                                                                             Phonology        43  Following are some more examples of words which have three syllables phonemically
and phonetically in lento speech (second column), but in which only two are realised
phonetically in allegro speech (third column):
(61)                           ơ ơơ               ơ ơ
           /a|wi|ax/         [»awijAx]          [»awjAx]          ‘taro’
                                ơ ơ ơ              ơ ơ
           /so|ku|os/        [»sokuwçs]         [»sokwçs]         ‘they order’
                                ơ ơ ơ              ơ ơ
           /ta|ku|o/         [»takuwç]          [»takwç]          ‘I feast’

           /a|wi|et/         [»awijEt]          [»awjEt]          ‘Pandanus sp.’41
                                ơ ơơ               ơ ơ
           /ma|wi|an/        [»mawijAn]         [»mawjAn]         ‘their hair’
   In trisyllabic words that do not have a sequence /iV/ or /uV/ in their second and third
syllable, such a reduction does not occur:42
(62)                           ơ ơơ
           /kam|0te|fo/      [kAm»tefo]           ‘Podocarpus pilgeri’
                               ơ ơơ ơ
           /woh|0ra|rar/     [wçx´»rarar]         ‘They shout’
   In allegro speech, when a schwa occurs as an optional phoneme in word-initial position
(see §2.1.1.1), in forms where the second syllable contains a vowel /i/, /i/ may also be
reduced to [j]. Note that the placement of stress is on the first full vowel in the forms where
the /i/ is reduced:
(63)                            ơơ               ơ ơ
           /tief/            [»tijEf]           [´»tjEf]          ‘ground-kangaroo’
                               ơơ                ơ ơ
           /kiet/            [»kijEt]           [´»kjEt]          ‘cloth’
    If the syllabic /i/ or /u/ in a trisyllabic word is reduced to [j] or [w] in allegro speech, the
first syllable receives stress, and there is no secondary stress:
(64)       /sokuos/          [»sokwçs]          ‘they order’
           /hifuoh/          [»hifwçx]          ‘they are diligent’
           /samuoh/          [»samwçx]          ‘it is heavy’
           /pawiah/          [»pawjAx]          ‘nutmeg’
41
     In Indonesian, this fruit is referred to as buah merah. The fruit is cooked, and the red flesh, which is full
     of seeds, is eaten. The seeds are spat out.
42
     Both of the forms below are possibly compound nouns, given the placement of main stress.
44     Chapter 22.7 Intonation
   Maybrat clauses are dominated by a single intonation contour. A single intonation
contour is characterised by a rise in pitch on the stressed syllable of the last word of a
clause followed by a very sharp drop. Pitch contours are marked in the examples below.43
(65)       ['ana 'mamo 'sorçN]
           /ana m-amo soroN/44
           3U     3U-go Sorong
           (ana mamo Soròng)
           ‘They go to Sorong.’
(66)       [´'ti   tuo    s´mi         'po]
           /ti     tuo    ø-smi        po/
           night   1S     ø-dream      thing
           (cti    tuo    smi          po)
           ‘At night I dream.’
43
     In the pitch contours, some corrections as to the voiced/unvoiced detection have been made by
     performing close-copy stylisation, i.e. some fundamental frequency contours have been replaced with
     straight line segments to yield perceptual equality with the original fundamental frequency (F0 curves).
     The pitch is placed on an ERB-rate scale (Equivalent Rectangular Bandwith rate) (Odé 1996:64–65).
44
     In this form, /N/ is a borrowed phoneme from Indonesian (see also footnote 14).
                                                                                         Phonology   45
   In this description, the pitch movement in (65), that is where a sharp drop in pitch
occurs, is marked by a grave accent (‘ ` ’) over the vowel, see for example the rises and
falls in pitch given in §6.1.
(67)       [f´ni'ja mape         'ku      m´xu                 k´'re]

(68)       ['ana mamo mançk'wari mo             'am]
            /ana m-amo manokwari m-o            am/

           (ana mamo Manokwari mo               am)
           ‘They go to Manokwari and take a letter.’
45
     A kre is a special hut built in the forest, which is used by women to give birth.
46      Chapter 2
   However, a fall in pitch is not always indicative of a clause-boundary: falls in pitch may
also be used to mark an opposition in emphasis, as in (69):
(69) a.     ['jAn s´kije 'amAx]
            /yan ø-skie amax/
            Yan ø-build house
            ‘Yan (as opposed to, for instance, Henkie) built a house.’
       b.   ['jAn s´kije 'amAx]
            /yan ø-skie amax/
            Yan ø-build house
            ‘Yan built a house (as opposed to, for instance, a shed).’
   In allegro speech, clauses may lose their individual intonation contour, as in (70). In this
example, ‘||’ marks a clause-boundary, although there are no intonational criteria by which
this boundary can be established.
(70)        [àit rae 'popçt || 'po                   m´sijAr]
            /ait rae popot          po               m-siar/
            3M man rich             ceremonial.cloth 3U-many
            (ait rae popot          po               msiar
            ‘He is a rich man, he has many ceremonial cloths.’

    Small rises and falls in pitch to mark prominence also occur. These are usually
irrelevant for the demarcation of constituency. An example:(71)     ['musijAx m´'no         m´'no           m´'no
         /m-usiax m-n-o          m-n-o           m-n-o

         'mama     'sija 'sija 'sija]46
         m-ama     sia    sia    sia/
         3U-come with with with
         ‘They hunted everywhere, accompanied by many dogs.’
   Pitch movements that rise, as in (71), are marked by an acute accent (‘ ´ ’) over the
vowel, see for example the rises and falls in pitch given in §6.1. In Appendix I rises and
falls in pitch are marked for reference.
   Contrastive intonation contours are attested in constructions involving so-called
‘perception verbs and mental activity verbs’. They are discussed in §8.3. Throughout this
work, intonation will be used as a test for constituency, most notably in Chapter 8 on
‘sequences of verbs’.","[58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]"
"19
     In Appendix IV I have included a table giving the most common kinship terms in Maybrat.
20
     The term m-fain ‘her wife’ is not used to refer to any social relation among the Maybrat. The term m-fain
     invariably means ‘their wives’. Likewise, y-a ‘his husband’ does not occur. Of course I could have tried
     to elicit the theoretical possibility that two people of the same sex got married, but I didn’t, since
     Maybrat society is not as ‘open minded’ as, for instance, Dutch society.
                                                                       Word classes    85   In possessive constructions where an inalienably possessed noun is the ‘possessed’, the
order of the constituents is possessor-possessed. The prefix on the inalienably possessed
noun must agree with the head noun for person and number. Some examples:
(126)   Sely m-me
        Sely 3U-mother
        ‘Sely’s mother’
(127)   amu p-tia
        1P    1P-father.P
        ‘our father’
(128)   Simon ø-sniem
        Simon ø-in.law
        ‘Simon’s in-law’
   Human or animal ‘families’ are also expressed as inalienably possessed notions. Some
examples:
(129)   ait y-atin
        3M 3M-group
        ‘his family/group’
(130)   fane m-sif
        pig 3U-nest
        ‘the pig’s nest’
   A second group of inalienably possessed nouns are terms for body parts. This group
also includes attributes of plants and animals. Examples of prefixation on terms for body
parts are given below:
(131)                  ‘head’       ‘tooth’       ‘buttocks’
        S     1        t-ana         t-pat         ø-hren
              2        n-ana         n-pat         ø-hren
              3M       y-ana         y-pat         ø-hren
              3U       m-ana         m-pat         ø-hren
        P     1        p-na          p-pat        ø-hren
              2        n-na          n-pat        ø-hren
              3        m-ana         m-pat        ø-hren
   Other examples of terms for body parts which take person prefixes are -atem
‘hand/arm’; -haf ‘stomach’; -asu ‘face’; -asoh ‘mouth’; and krem ‘finger/toe’.
   Some examples of possessive constructions involving terms for body parts:
(132)   fnia    m-ao
        woman 3U-foot
        ‘the woman’s foot’
(133)   Yan y-asoh
        Yan 3M-mouth
        ‘Yan’s mouth’
86      Chapter 4(134)     Potafit ø-krem
          Potafit ø-finger
          ‘Potafit’s finger’
  Some terms for body parts of animals are -aim ‘wing’ and -awian ‘feathers/fur’.
Examples of these terms in possessive constructions:
(135)     ru m-aim
          bird 3U-wing
          ‘the bird’s wing’
(136)     kak      m-awian
          cuscus 3U-feathers/fur
          ‘the cuscus’ fur’
   Terms for body parts include attributes of plants. Some are listed in (137). With the
exception of kre ‘branch’, all these forms are naturally marked with a third person prefix
m-. Only three of these terms are attested with different person prefixes, albeit with a
slightly different, but related, meaning: y-akan ‘his eyes’/‘his testicles’; y-arak ‘his skin’;
y-tis ‘his veins’.

   Some of the nouns referring to attributes of plants, namely m-ake ‘its fruit’, m-akan ‘its
seed’, m-ata ‘its leaf’ as well as the body part term m-ana ‘its head’ can function as
classifiers in an NP (see §5.1.3).
   A last category of inalienably possessed nouns are the spatial nouns. Spatial nouns are
nouns that refer to relational parts of objects (Svorou 1993:83), such as ‘the inside’, ‘the
outside’, ‘the middle’ and so on. In many languages terms for spatial relations derive from
terms for body parts (see Svorou 1993; Hopper & Thompson 1984; Heine et al. 1991;
Foley 1997). In Maybrat, there are two (elicited) instances of terms for body parts that are
used to refer to a ‘spatial’ notion, namely -asu ‘face’ and soka ‘mouth’. Both terms refer to
the concept ‘front’.22 They enter into the same type of possessive relation as the other
terms for body parts, as illustrated in (147) and (148):
(147)       amah m-asu
            house 3U-face
            ‘the front of the house’
(148)       amah ø-soka
            house ø-mouth
            ‘the front of the house’
     Other spatial nouns found in Maybrat are given in (149).
(149)       m-aom         ‘outside’
            m-ato         ‘hole, inside’
            m-asuf        ‘middle’
            m-aum         ‘border’
            m-ur          ‘around’
   These nouns are formally similar: all begin with ‘m’, which coincides with the third
person unmarked person prefix. There is one form which is evidence for the fact that m- is
a person prefix. It is given in (150). Here, -ato ‘hole’ receives a third person masculine
person prefix y-. This form is taken from a text recorded by Han Schoorl in the period
21
     M-arak also means ‘It is empty.’.
22
     Other forms are unattested, e.g. *amah ø-kpor ‘the back of the house’ where ø-kpor means ‘back of a
     human or animal’.
88      Chapter 4between 1972–74, that is twenty-five years before I collected data in Ayawasi. Although
informants were able to translate it, they identified it as a form that is no longer used.
(150)     ait y-ato
          3M 3M-hole
          ‘He is riddled (with bullets).’ (lit. ‘He is holed.’)
   Other forms with putative person prefixes other than m- appeared unacceptable upon
elicitation, for example *t-asuf, *t-apuo.23
   Examples of possessive constructions involving spatial nouns are:
(151)     amah m-aom
          house 3U-outside
          ‘outside the house’ (lit. ‘the outside of the house’)
(152)     aya    m-asuf
          water 3U-middle
          ‘the middle of the water’ (lit. ‘the water’s middle’)
(153)     ara m-ato
          tree 3U-hole
          ‘inside the tree’ (lit. ‘the tree’s inside’)
   The uniformity in the first consonant ‘m’ in the spatial nouns can hardly be attributed to
sheer coincidence: it suggests that the spatial nouns are fossilised forms of inalienably
possessed nouns that used to take person prefixes other than m-. Given the uniformity in
form among the spatial nouns, the (archaic) form in (150), and the similarity in behaviour
of all these nouns in possessive constructions, I conclude that spatial nouns are a subclass
of inalienably possessed nouns.
   Although the spatial nouns are classified as a subclass of the nouns, their nominal
character can arguably be questioned: as opposed to regular nouns, spatial nouns lack some
typically nominal features. For example, m-ato is the only spatial noun that can function as
the subject of a clause, as in (154), or as the head of an NP (155).
(154)     m-ato     m-ae ara
          3U-hole 3U-at tree
          ‘There’s a hole in the wood.’
(155)     m-ato m-api re-t-o
          3U-hole 3U-big location.SPEC-near-U
          ‘this big hole’
23
     The form suf ‘middle’ is used by members of the Air family, who have their origins in the area to the
     north of Ayawasi. Suf is semantically similar to m-asuf ‘middle’, the form used in Ayawasi. Formally,
     the ‘northern’ form lacks a putative person prefix m-, and a vowel a. An example is iso suf ‘the middle
     of the path’ which is a possessive construction of the type possessor-possessed:
        y-amo ø-frok        iso suf
        3M-go ø-emerge path middle
        ‘He emerges at the middle of the path.’
                                                                            Word classes     89   Another form which may be a spatial noun is mpair ‘place’. Although this form is
unattested in possessive constructions of the type ‘possessor-possessed’, it is formally
similar to the other spatial nouns in that it is m-initial.24 It can occur as the head of an NP:
(156)       mpair m-of
            place 3U-good
            ‘The place is good.’
   While spatial nouns are in some ways formally and syntactically similar to other
inalienably possessed nouns, they also lack some properties that are typically associated
with nouns.","[102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107]"

4.7.2 Manner adverbs
    Manner adverbs say something about the way in which an event takes place. Most
manner adverbs can only modify a predicate, while others can modify an NP as well.
Therefore, a subdivision into two groups based on syntactic criteria seems warranted: the
first group constitutes manner adverbs that can only modify a predicate. Some examples
follow:57
     Ti- ‘side.N’ (see §4.4.) and ti ‘PAST’ are homophones which are possibly related, as in many languages
     temporal decitic forms are derived from demonstrative forms (see also §6.8.1).
        The element t-i in a. below is unrelated to either ti- ‘side.N’ or ti ‘PAST’. Rather, it is a contracted form
     of t-imara ‘my ear’. Compare b., in which the subject is 3M. The expression -imara m-tuk ‘ears are
     closed’ is common to refer to small children who do not yet understand fully what goes on in the adult
     world.
        a. tuo tian           t-i      m-tuk        t-awia toro
             1S formerly 1S-ear 3U-closed 1S-cry continuously
             ‘Formerly, (when) my ears were closed, I cried continuously.’
        b. ait tian           y-i      m-tuk        y-awia toro
             3M formerly 3M-ear 3U-closed 3M-cry continuously
             ‘Formerly, (when) his ears were closed, he cried continuously.’
                                                                                       Word classes        113(279)       ae            ‘indeed’
            mimo          ‘very’
            kaket         ‘well, carefully’
            ninan58       ‘at random’
            toro          ‘many times’ (connotation: until bored)
            war           ‘reject’
   In a clause, these adverbs occur following the verb, but they do not necessarily occur in
clause-final position, as indicated in example (281). Some examples in a clause are:
(280)       Petrus y-mat          Hosti m-sia     Eka kaket
            Petrus 3M-observe Hosti 3U-with Eka well
            ‘Petrus observes Hosti and Eka well.’
(281)       m-ao           ro m-anes iwai          m-hu     ninan       to tauf
            3U-sibling.SS REL 3U-old just.now 3U-stay at.random LOC forest
            ‘Her older sister (mentioned) just now lives wherever (suits her best) in the
            forest.’
   The form war ‘reject’ would semantically also qualify as a verb: however, it never
occurs with a subject prefix. Like other manner adverbs, it occurs in clause-final position,
and it says something about the way in which an event (in (282) about ‘how’ something is
put (away)) takes place. I therefore analyse it as a manner adverb.
(282)       p-se      war
            1p-place reject
            ‘We rejected it.’
  Two other manner adverbs are ati ‘really’ and tu ‘indeed, really, truly’. They can
modify a clause, as in (283), or a NP, as in (284). The semantic difference between these
two adverbs is not clear. They always occur in constituent-final position.
(283)       m-atiet     ati    a
            3U-perish really INT
            ‘Did she really perish?’
(284)       rae      tu    me-t-ait
            person really PRESTT-near-3M
            ‘He is a human.’ (lit. ‘He is a real man.’)
     The syntactic behaviour of manner adverbs in clauses is described in §6.8.2.","[130, 131]"
"3.1.3 Some exceptions
   So far, the analysis of the constraints on the phonological expression of person prefixes
in terms of the CV-syllable structure has been straightforward: forms with monosyllabic
stems, and forms with V-initial stems take overt person prefixes. C-initial forms with
bisyllabic stems take covert person prefixes, unless the second syllable in the stem is V-
initial, or the stem contains a VV-sequence where one V is a (reducible) /i/ or /u/ (see also
§2.6). C-initial stems with two or more syllables take covert person prefixes. There are two
categories of forms, however, that do not seem open to such a straightforward solution. To
54      Chapter 3begin with, the forms in (14) are bisyllabic, and the second syllable of the stem is V-initial.
By analogy to those forms in (7) and (9) which have /i/ or /u/ in their first syllable, the
forms in (14) would be expected to receive an overt person prefix. However, prefixed
forms are rejected, as indicated in the last column in the examples below:
(14)        /kiam/       [»kijAm]       CV|VC           ‘I am ill’            *[m-»kijAm]
            /fia/        [»fija]        CV|V            ‘I swallow’           *[m-»fija]
            /yuo/        [»juwo]        CV|V            ‘I flee’              *[m-»juwo]
    It seems to be the case that CV-structure alone cannot account for all the forms, and that
in some cases stress also plays a role. Recall, that in Maybrat, stress is lightly phonemic. In
many cases it can be predicted, but in the forms in (14), stress falls on the first syllable, and
/i/ or /u/ in this syllable cannot be reduced. The resulting verb has two syllables, and will
not allow a person prefix because this would add an extra syllable to the form, resulting in
an illicit tri-syllabic form.2
    A second group of forms that do not tally with the observation that monosyllabic stems
can take an overt person prefix is given in (15). These forms, despite the fact that they
constitute monosyllabic stems, never take overt person prefixes. I propose that these forms
are marked lexically as exceptions to the rule of person prefixing.32
     An alternative solution is as follows: if on a morphophonological level it is assumed that the glides [y]
     and [w] between the vowels in (14) are not epenthetic, but phonologically present, i.e. /y/ and /w/, then
     the stems of the forms in (14) can be represented as in (a) below. This yields forms in which the second
     syllable of the stem is C-initial, i.e. forms that are analogous to those in (10), (11) and (12):
       (a) /kiyam/         [»kijAm]          CV|CVC        ‘I am ill’
            /fiya/         [»fija]           CV|CV         ‘I swallow’
            /yuwo/         [»juwo]           CV|CV         ‘I flee’
           The difference in morphological behaviour between all these forms could then be explained in terms
     of CV-structure, just like the other forms. However, there are no minimal pairs to warrant a distinction
     between the presence versus the absence of the glides /y/ and /w/ in this position. As such, the distinction
     would have to be described on a morphophonological level.
           Obviously this morphophonological criterion does not work for forms that never take a person
     prefix. For example, nouns that have a /VyV/ sequence or a /VwV/ sequences may be transcribed
     morphophonologically as either :VyV: / :VwV: or as :VV:, as illustrated in (b):
       (b) [»tijEf]        :tief:       or       :tiyef:        ‘ground kangaroo’
            [»tijEt]       :tiet:                :tiyet:        ‘four’
            [»kijEt]       :kiet:                :kiyet:        ‘cloth’
            [»pijAx]       :piax:                :piyax:        ‘ficus sp.’
            [»tuwo]        :tuo:        or       :tuwo:         ‘I’
            [»tuwçx]       :tuox:                :tuwox:        ‘place’
            [»kuwo]        :kuo:                 :kuwo:         ‘sago-powder’
3
     There is one way to explain the odd behaviour of the forms in (15), namely that they are a relic of what
     was once a distinction in length. Throughout the collection of data, informants kept insisting on audible
     differences between certain homophones, for instance between the forms given in Chapter 2, footnote 20
     ([»nasçm] ‘You carry, your name is’; [»maru] ‘She cuts, lake’; [»ana] ‘they, fence’ and [»moo] ‘She takes,
     She itches’; and [m´»tAx] ‘dog, It is bitter’ etc.). The strategies to find this difference were as follows: (1)
     Recordings were made of the words both in isolation and in context. In these recordings no differences
     were found after thorough analysis with the speech program GIPOS (Graphical Interactive Processing of
     Speech, see also Chapter 2, footnote 34); (2) The recordings mentioned in (1) were manipulated,
     whereby: (a) the vowels in the forms were lengthened/shortened, and the pitch at which they were uttered
     was changed; and (b) putative minimal forms uttered in a context were interchanged. The results of these
     manipulations were offered to informants, but no clear indications for the existence for minimal pairs was
                                                                                 Morphophonology           55(15)       /tom/       [tçm]         ‘I vomit’
                                     ‘you vomit’
                                     etc.
           /tim/       [tim]         ‘I send’
           /sax/       [sAx]         ‘it is unripe’
           /sox/       [sçx]         ‘I deceive’
           /kat/       [kAt]         ‘it is dry’
3.2 Formation of question words
   The formation of question words suggests the presence of a morphophonological glide
between two vowels. Question words are formed by adding an interrogative particle -yo or
-ye to a demonstrative base.4 Some examples (forms between ‘: :’ are morphophonological
representations):
(16)       /to-yo/         :to-yo:         ‘where’ (SPEC)
           /wo-yo/         :wo-yo:         ‘where’ (GEN)
    Two other forms, including the morphophonological representations, appear below:
(17)       /fi-ye/         :fi-ye:         ‘how’
           /mi-yo/         :mi-yo:         ‘where’ (ADV)
   Theoretically, the morphophonological forms in (17) could be *:fie: and *:mio:, as these
could underlie the same phonetic forms as those given above, that is [»fije] and [»mijo]
respectively. However, it is clear from the forms in (16) that the interrogative suffix is
:y:-initial. By analogy, I conclude that the suffixes in the forms in (17) are also :y:-initial,
in other words, that the glide in these forms is morphophonologically present.3.3 /a/-initial stems
   Maybrat verbs and inalienably possessed nouns (including kinship terms) of which the
stem begins with /a/, lack this /a/ in the first and second person plural forms (but not in the
third person unmarked). In other words, there is an alternation between first and second
person plural stems and the rest. If the first and second person plural stems are
C-initial, the CC-sequence resulting after prefixation with a phonologically expressed
person prefix is broken up by an epenthetic schwa.
    found; (3) Perception experiments were performed, in which one informant was asked to utter relevant
    (i.e. members of the putative minimal forms) and irrelevant forms in random order in isolation, and
    another informant was asked to translate these forms into Indonesian. It was found that informants could
    not differentiate between putative minimal pairs. Based on the results of (1), (2) and (3) I conclude that
    there is no difference, but given the speakers’ insistence, there may once have been a difference in, for
    instance, length, that has disappeared, but which has persisted in the morphophonology of verbs. If this is
    the case, the forms considered in (15) may have had phonologically ‘long’ vowels, which, like bisyllabic
    stems, disqualified them for overt prefixation.

   First and second person plural stems which are vowel-initial are phonetically long.
These phonetically long vowels are analysed as sequences of two like vowels, as illustrated
in (19). Alternatively, they can be analysed as /V:/. However, no minimal pairs were found
to warrant a phonemic distinction between long and short vowels, whereas vowel
sequences do occur (see §2.2.1).

                              < :po: ‘NOM’ + :pat: plural stem of :-apat: ‘eat vegetables’
   The question arises whether or not these plural stems can be interpreted as monosyllabic
lengthening. However, a phonetically long vowel also occurs in po-iit [»po-i:t] ‘food, things
we eat’, This is not a monosyllabic form. I conclude that the long vowels in these forms
cannot be attributed to monosyllabic lengthening. Note that differences between singular
and plural stems also occur in other Bird’s Head languages, for example Moi (Menick pers.
comm.) and Tehit (Flassy 1991).","[71, 72, 73, 74]"
"4.5 Question words
   Question words are used to request information. In a sentence, these question words
take the place of the constituent that is questioned. Interrogative constructions are
discussed in more detail in §7.1. In this section, I will discuss the morphological features of
the class of question words in Maybrat.
   Below, a list of the question words is given. With the exception of ro-yo, the forms
under (241a) also appear in (204).
(241) a.       to-yo          area.N-INT                  ‘where?’
               wo-yo          location.GEN-INT            ‘where?’
               mi-yo          PRESTT-INT                  ‘where?’
               fi-ye          similar.to-INT              ‘how?’
               ro-yo          REL-INT                     ‘which one?’
         b.    awiya          ‘who?’
               r-awiya        POSS-who                    ‘whose?’
               p-awiya        thing-who                   ‘what?’
         c.    tiya           ‘how much/many?’
               titiya         ‘when?’
   The interrogatives under (a) formally consist of two morphemes: an interrogative base
-yo or -ye (the choice of interrogative base seems to be lexically rather than phonologically
or morphologically motivated) preceded by an interrogative prefix or a relativiser.
   As indicated in the third column above, there are three forms that are translated into
English as ‘where’. The difference between these forms depends firstly on the specificity
of the interrogated location (to- vs. wo-), and secondly on the syntactic function of the
question word (to- and wo- vs. mi-).
   The interrogative prefix to- is related to the demonstrative prefix te- ‘area.N’: both refer
to an area, and both can be used as a substantive. Likewise, the interrogative prefix wo-
and the demonstrative prefix we- are related: both refer to ‘general’ locations. A contrast
between to-yo and wo-yo follows:
(242)         n-amo to-yo
              2-go   area.N-INT
              ‘Where are you going?’
47
     The form fi-ra is dialectal (from the area to the north of Ayawasi), rendered fi-re in Ayawasi. fi-re is a
     marker for manner in adverbial clauses. For a discussion, see §9.2.3.
106       Chapter 4(243)       m-amo wo-yo
            3U-go location.GEN-INT
            ‘Where does she go?’ (implication: she does not have a clear goal)
   In other words, the contrast in specificity between to-yo and wo-yo is the same as that
between te-f-o and we-f-o, where in both cases the form with we-/wo- is the generic form.
   The words to-yo and wo-yo are normally used to question the locational object of a
verb, as illustrated in (242) and (243): they are used as substantives. To-yo and wo-yo
contrast with mi-yo. The word mi-yo can be used as a substantive, but it can also function
adverbially. Given that some of the other prefixes are derived from the demonstrative
forms, it seems likely on functional grounds that the interrogative prefix mi- is related to
the demonstrative prefix me- ‘PRESTT’, despite the presence of the vowel /i/ rather than /o/
in the prefix. Some examples with mi-yo appear below: in (244) mi-yo functions as a
substantive. In (245) and (246) mi-yo is used adverbially: these are nominal clauses.48
Example (247) illustrates that to-yo cannot function adverbially.
(244)       m-apo mi-yo
            3U-be PRESTT-INT
            ‘Where is she?’
(245)       ku    mi-yo
            child PRESTT-INT
            ‘Where is the child?’
(246)       mpair ro y-tien      mi-yo
            place REL 3M-sleep PRESTT-INT
            ‘Where is the place where he sleeps?’
(247)       *n-naif to-yo
            2-nose area.N-INT
    In other words, the relation between mi-yo on the one hand and to-yo/wo-yo on the other
is the same as that between me-f-o on the one hand and te-f-o/we-f-o on the other: forms
with a prefix me-/mi- function adverbially, while the rest cannot.49 The form ro-yo ‘which
one’ consists of an interrogative base preceded by the relative clause marker ro ‘that’ (see
§4.10.1). The form ro-yo is used in questions where a choice is offered:
48
     Here too, it can be argued that mi-yo functions predicatively.
49
     Although I have just stated that the form to-yo cannot function predicatively (i.e. in a nominal clause),
     there are a few examples in the data which suggest the opposite:
          a. belanga      / po        to-yo
              cooking.pot     thing area.N-INT
              ‘Cooking pots, from where are these things?’
          b. m-o      p-awiya / kan            to-yo
              3U-take thing-what charcoal area.N-INT
              ‘What are they to take (for cooking), where is the charcoal?’
       It is unclear why these forms are acceptable while (247) (and many other structurally similar forms) are
     not. Clearly, (247) is definitely unacceptable according to informants because it can only be interpreted as
     *‘Where has your nose gone off to.’ (i.e. a predicative interpretation), and noses don’t normally run off by
     themselves (except maybe in fairy-tales, but I didn’t check that).
                                                                                         Word classes           107(248)       nuo n-ama terima agama ro-yo
            2S 2-go receive religion REL-INT
            ‘Which religion do you (go and) accept?’
   The element fi-, which seems to be isomorphous to the demonstrative prefix fi- ‘similar
to’, can be affixed with the interrogative base -ye to form fi-ye ‘how’. Some examples:
(249)       t-no fi-ye
            1S-do similar.to-INT
            ‘How do I do it? (lit. ‘Like what should I do it?’)
(250)       y-awe fi-ye
            3M-say similar.to-INT
            ‘What does he say?’ (lit. ‘Like what does he say it?’)
   All the interrogative forms discussed so far have been multimorphemic, and for all of
them an interrogative base -yo/-ye could be identified. The interrogative forms in (241b)
(that is awiya, r-awiya, p-awiya) and (241c) (that is tiya, titiya) are not as obviously
polymorphemic. The last syllable in these forms is invariably [ja], similar to the
interrogative forms -yo and -ye. By formal analogy to the other interrogative forms, I will
assume that the [j] in [ja] is isomorphous to [j] in -yo and -ye. [ja] is therefore rendered ya.
The portion preceding [ja] in awiya, r-awiya, p-awiya, tiya and titiya cannot be identified
as existing morphemes in the language (with the possible exception of ti-, see below).
   The form awiya ‘who’ can be affixed with the possessive prefix ro- or the nominal
prefix po- to form interrogatives that mean ‘whose’ and ‘what’ respectively. In both forms
the vowel in the prefix is elided because awiya is vowel-initial (see also §3.4).
(251)       awiya ø-skie amah
            who ø-build house
            ‘Who built the house?’
(252)       ku    r-awiya m-awia

            ‘Whose child cries?’
(253)       pi   y-ko      y-no    p-awiya e?
            man 3M-roast 3M-do NOM-who hey
            ‘Hey, what does the man roast?’ (lit. ‘The man roasts, what does he do?’)
     Some examples with tiya ‘how much’, ‘how many’ follow:
(254)       rae m-ana    tiya
            man 3U-head how.many
            ‘How many people?’

            ‘How long do you stay inside there and feast?’
     Examples of titiya ‘when’ appear below.5150
     The combination of to and mato to express a prepositional notion ‘inside’ is well attested (see §4.8.3).

   In many Papuan languages, the counting system is based on terms for body parts:
in addition to referring to a body part, these terms also denote a particular number.
Such systems have been described by, for instance, Laycock (1975); L. de Vries and
R. de Vries-Wiersma (1992); L. de Vries (1993). In Maybrat, the terms for the numbers
from ‘one’ up to ‘four’, and in some dialects ‘five’, are unique terms. From ‘six’ upwards,
the numbers are referred to by using terms for hands/fingers and feet/toes, until ‘one man is
dead/gone’ representing ‘twenty’ is reached. Papuan counting-systems based on five
numbers are well known, and are found in, for instance, the Papuan New Guinean East
Sepik and the Eastern and Western Highlands as well as in Papua (Smith 1988:9, 12).
   The numerals in Maybrat form a closed class of words. The cardinal numbers from one
to five are as follows:
(258)        s-au/s-ait            ‘one’
             ewok/eok52            ‘two’
             tuf                   ‘three’
             tiet                  ‘four’
             mat/tem-s-au53        ‘five’
   Of these, the terms for ‘one’ are the only morphologically complex ones: both consist of
a number base s- ‘one’ followed by an unmarked pronoun au ‘she, it’ or a masculine
pronoun ait ‘he’. The term s-ait only applies when the head noun is masculine singular:
(259) a.      fnia   s-au
              woman one-3U
              ‘one woman’
        b.    amah s-au
              house one-3U
              ‘one house’51
   The first syllable ti in titiya is possibly related to the temporal adverb ti PAST (see §4.7.1). Although here
   ti- does not refer to a period in the past, it does refer to time, given that the form titiya means ‘how much
   time’, as opposed to tiya, which means ‘how much’.
52
   Both of these forms are used in Ayawasi.
53
   In Ayawasi, mat and tem s-au are both used. Tem s-au is a structurally complex form which derives from
   tem (< -atem) ‘hand’ and s-au ‘one’. It is invariably used by members of the Tenau-family, who have their
   origins in the area directly to the south of Ayawasi (see Appendix I for the story of origin of this family).
   The term mat for ‘five’ is at present most commonly used in Ayawasi.
                                                                                      Word classes        109(260)       pi   s-ait
            man one-3M
            ‘one man’
   The numbers from ‘six’ upwards are all structurally complex. From ‘six’ to ‘nine’ the
terms literally mean ‘one finger’ for ‘six’; ‘two fingers’ for ‘seven’ and so on, where it is
understood that one hand has already been counted. For ‘ten’ s-t-atem is used, which
includes the word t-atem ‘my hand’.54 The number base s- ‘one’ includes both hands when
referring to ‘ten’. Below, a morpheme-by-morpheme translation of the term for ‘six’
appears:
(261)      krem       s-au                ‘six’
           finger/toe one-3U
           ‘one finger’
     The terms for ‘six’ to ‘ten’:55
(262)      krem s-au                      ‘six’
           krem ewok                      ‘seven’
           krem tuf                       ‘eight’
           krem tiet                      ‘nine’
           s-t-atem                       ‘ten’
     The numbers from ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’ are given in (263):
(263)      oo krem s-au                   ‘eleven’
           oo krem ewok                   ‘twelve’
           oo krem tuf                    ‘thirteen’
           oo krem tiet                   ‘fourteen’
           oo s-au m-uf                   ‘fifteen’
           oo s-au krem s-au              ‘sixteen’
           oo s-au krem ewok              ‘seventeen’
           oo s-au krem tuf               ‘eighteen’
           oo s-au krem tiet              ‘nineteen’
   All these terms include the element krem ‘finger/toe’ and oo, the plural stem of -ao
‘foot’ (see §3.3). The element krem is an inalienably possessed noun, which normally
receives a ø- prefix. Consider, however, the form tem, which derives from -atem, in tem
s-au ‘five’, and oo in the numerals given in (263) which derives from -ao. These do not
receive a person prefix. By analogy to these forms, I assume that krem also does not
receive a (albeit covert) person prefix in the numerals. Admittedly, the form s-t-atem does
incorporate a person prefix, but this form constitutes the only example in the numerals
described. I assume that s-t-atem is an exception to the rule.
   From ‘eleven’ to ‘fourteen’ the terms literally mean ‘foot-toe-one’ for ‘eleven’;
‘foot-toe-two’ for ‘twelve’ and so on, where it is understood that two hands have already
been counted. The term for ‘fifteen’ literally means ‘one full foot’, as indicated below:54
   -Atem is used to refer to ‘hand/arm’, and -ao to ‘foot/leg’. In my discussions on numerals (see also §5.1.4)
   I translate them as ‘hand’ and ‘foot’ respectively.
55
   Tanam ‘six’ is a unique number term which is used in the area around Aytinyo. It was never given to me
   as the equivalent of ‘six’ by inhabitants of Ayawasi.
110       Chapter 4(264)       oo s-au         m-uf                       ‘fifteen’
            foot one-3U 3U-full
            ‘one full foot’
   From ‘sixteen’ up to and including ‘nineteen’ the terms literally mean
‘foot-one-toe-one’ for ‘sixteen’; ‘foot-one-toe-two’ for ‘seventeen’ and so on. The fact that
one foot has been counted is indicated in the term oo s-au. A morpheme-by-morpheme
translation of the term for ‘sixteen’ is as follows:
(265)       oo s-au        krem    s-au               ‘sixteen’
            foot one-3U finger/toe one-3U
            ‘one foot, one toe’
     The term for ‘twenty’ literally means ‘one man is dead/gone’:
(266)       rae s-ait     y-hai                       ‘twenty’
            man one-3M 3M-dead
            ‘One man is dead/gone.’
   Counting is accompanied by gestures: when counting up to twenty, the fingers and the
toes are touched. Counting usually starts with the little finger of one of the two hands. Each
finger is folded. When all fingers have been counted, a fist is made, which is held up to
indicate ‘five’. Subsequently, the fingers of the other hand are counted, again starting with
the little finger. For ‘ten’, the palms of both hands are put together and held up. After this,
the toes are counted, starting with the little toe on one foot, until the little toe on the other
foot is reached.56
   Multiples of twenty are given below. Literally, the number of ‘men gone’ are counted.
When people have to count large amounts in Maybrat, which still happens in, for instance,
the exchange of ceremonial cloth, they make multiples of twenty, which are then in turn
counted.
(267)    rae s-ait y-hai    ‘twenty’
         rae ewok m-hai     ‘forty’
         rae tuf m-hai      ‘sixty’
         etc.
   Numerals from ‘twenty’ onwards can theoretically be constructed by adding up digits.
However, nowadays Indonesian is used for these numbers. Elicited examples of numerals
above ‘twenty’ in Maybrat were not unequivocal. Because of this, they will be ignored in
the present description.
   Ordinals are made by using the relativiser ro (see §5.3 on relative clauses):
(268)       ro    tuf
            REL three
            ‘the third’56
     Only the older people still count like this. Younger people normally count in Indonesian, and most can
     only count up to ‘ten’ in Maybrat. Younger people do not touch the corresponding body parts when
     counting in Maybrat. I have not heard mixing up of Maybrat and Indonesian number systems, for
     example* eyok-ribu ‘two thousand’.
                                                                       Word classes    111(269)   ro   mat
        REL five
        ‘the fifth’
(270)   ro    s-t-atem
        REL one-1S-hand
        ‘the tenth’
   The demonstrative prefix ti- ‘side.N’ can be attached to s-au ‘one’ to form ti-s-au ‘one
side’. Some examples follow:
(271)   ait ø-safa ti-s-au
        3M ø-slice side.N-one-3U
        ‘He slices on one side (of, for example, a large chunk of meat).’
(272)   tuoh ro atu             ti-s-au        to m-asom Mmuk
        place REL mountain side.N-one-3U LOC 3U-name Mmuk
        ‘The place on that side of the mountain is called Mmuk.’
  Syntactically, the structurally complex number terms resemble NPs, although the head
noun receives no person prefix. I will illustrate this in §5.1.4.","[123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129]"

     Dutch names were sometimes given to people under the influence of the Dutch Missionaries (see §1.2).
4              Word classes   In the present chapter, Maybrat words are assigned to different word classes. I will
define word classes on the basis of two grammatical criteria, namely morphological and
syntactic (cf. Schachter 1985:3).
   A word is the smallest unit of a sentence which has positional mobility (Cruse 1986:35)
and which cannot be interrupted by a pause (Lyons 1968:202). According to these criteria,
amah ‘house’ and fane ‘pig’ are words: they have positional mobility in the sentence and
they cannot be interrupted by a pause. By the same criteria, t-kias ‘I tell’ and re-f-o ‘this
very.near’ are words, albeit morphologically complex ones: they each consist of more than
one morpheme.
   In Maybrat, the following thirteen word classes can be defined:
         pronouns (person deixis)
         verbs
         nouns
         demonstratives
         question words
         numerals
         adverbs
         location markers
         directionals
         coordinators
         subordinate clause markers
         enumerators
         interjections
   Person deixis is the first item to be discussed (§4.1). The reason for this early
presentation is that it can then be referred to in the subsequent discussion of the largest
(open) classes, that is those of verbs (§4.2) and nouns (§4.3). In the presentation of verbs,
the morphological properties are discussed in §4.2, and from §4.2.1 onwards the different
classes of verbs are discussed. At the end of §4.2, I will describe derivation. Section 4.3, on
nouns, begins with a discussion of inalienably possessed nouns which include kinship
terms, terms for body parts and spatial nouns, and alienably possessed nouns.
Subsequently, lexical nominalisation and compound nouns are treated. The class of
demonstratives is described in §4.4, followed by a discussion on question words in §4.5.","[78, 79]"

     I have not been able to trace the exact meaning or function of wa. It was translated into Malay (i.e. not
     Standard Indonesian) as pele, which can be translated as ‘screen off’, or ‘protect’. Other occurrences of
     the form wa occur in Appendix III, line 53.

     The woman indicates with her hands how the kiyit is tied around their bodies.

     Ratau refers to scrapings of plants, wood etc. Ratau is used to acquire strength (Avé pers.comm.).

     As is also indicated later on in the interview, the women who undergo the ceremony stay in a separate
     section of the house.
7
     M-pau is adequately translated as ‘sacred’ or ‘forbidden’.
8
     P-mo is a false start, Ais Mawe picks up again at s-au.

     It is unclear whom ‘they’ refers to. Possibly it refers to the group of people who accompany the women
     undergoing the ceremony.

   The use of a long vowel [u] indicates that they stay for a long time. See, for instance, also lines 14, 15, 25,
   32 etc.
11
   In this form, a schwa occurs as an optional phoneme (see §2.1.1.1). See line 16 for an example involving
   etiet ‘four’.
12
   The woman emphasises kiyit ro fiyan re-f-o by repeating it. Kiyit ro fiyan re-f-o is the notional subject of
   this sentence.
13
   That is, the waist decoration.
14
   P-oo m-apan literally means ‘the undersides of our feet’. It is a possessive construction of the type
   ‘possessor-possessed’ (see §4.3.1).
15
   Again, she indicates where they wore the decorations.
16
   That is, they put away the short kiyits.

   Here she indicated the dark-blue skirt, which she was wearing at the time of the interview.

   The verb -aut ‘climb’ is also used to refer to the putting on of garments or decorations.
19
   This seems to be a false start: this portion does not fit into the syntax of the rest of the sentence.
20
   That is, they wore four prats on the upper part of each arm.
21
   She is referring to four safah ‘bracelets’ mentioned in the following line.
22
   Ais Mawe indicates with her hands that the bands (prat) mentioned in lines 15 and 16 are worn on the
   upper part of the body, and bracelets (safah) on the upper arm.
23
   Yu refers to a bag that is woven from pandanus leaves. It has a long belt which enables someone to wear
   the bag in the typical Papuan way: the bag is carried on the back with the strap over the head.

         One would expect a possessive marker on the personal pronoun, i.e. yu r-ana ‘their bag’.
25
   Am are mats made out of pandanus leaves. They are multifunctional, being used to sleep and sit on, as rain
   capes, and to carry things around.
26
   Siar ‘common.place’ may be related to m-siar ‘there are many’, as both refer to the same semantic notion.
27
   Siari is a phonologically adapted form of cari ‘to search, to look for’.

   An extract, which women used to wash themselves with, was made in the bamboo. (see line 110).

   The form t-kah ‘my body’ is often used to refer explicitly to someone’s body. It is unclear why here the

34
   Kiyit is the object of the clause fnia m-ai kiyit. In this sentence it has been topicalised (see §6.6).
35
   The lengthening of a vowel (see footnote 10) also occurs in Indonesian loans.
36
   Prat is a waistband, not a headband. In the following sentence she corrects herself, and says that a band

37
   The headcovering was worn by women for protection.

   That is, the kiyit ‘cloth’.

   That is, after the rituals, they took off the headcovering (no longer needing its protection), and just went

   An am ‘mat’ was placed inside the bag that the women wore on their heads during the rituals.

   A traditional shaman sometimes rubs, blows on or simply looks at plants or parts of plants, in order to
   receive answers to questions concerning healing. This is called baca obat, lit. ‘read medicine’ in
   Indonesian. I have translated this as ‘to divine’ in this text. ø-sus ‘divine’, especially for women to attract
   luck or fortune (W. Avé pers. comm.) seems to imply divination by looking at something, while ø-tamah
   ‘divine’ (line 56) implies divination by blowing into something. Tkief (line 58) also refers to ‘divine’, but
   it is unclear to me what type of divination is meant.
42
   At this point, Ais Mawe is confused. She is looking for the word forera ‘k.o. grass’, which Lys gives to
   her in line 56.
43
   Formally, this looks like a reduplicated form, in which the verb stem is -tak. This form, however, was not
   found in the data.
44
   Here, wo is used as a locative adverbial clause marker (see §9.2.2).

   Amu rae is semantically a possessive construction. For this form, involving two alienably possessed
   nouns, one would expect the form rae r-amu, i.e. the order ‘possessed-possessor’. However, here the order
   is ‘possessor-possessed’, the regular order if the possessed is an inalienably possessed noun (see §4.3.1
   and §4.3.2).
51
   It is not clear what exactly is taken by the initiees and their fathers and brothers.
52
   The Maybrat exchange ceremonial cloth in marriage: the family of the male has to ‘pay’ the family of the
   female an agreed number of ceremonial cloths (see Schoorl 1979, Chapter V).
53
   A number of presentative forms are used here. They are used to stress the explanation of why the pigs and
   the ceremonial cloth, which we (i.e. Avé and myself) knew played an important role in Maybrat society,
   were relevant in the women ceremonies as well.
54
   It is not clear whether she means that eating a pig or the possession of a pig gives people strength.

   It is not clear what is meant by pokek ‘red things’. The different ways to divine things are also not
   understood (see also line 48).
70
   I assume that this form is a nominalised form given the formal properties, i.e. the form po followed by
   another form (see §4.3.4). However, snuk was only found as an independent form meaning ‘to count’.
   This verb does not seem to be related to the snuk in po-snuk.
71
   Ais Mawe (incorrectly) assumes that Lys knows the same things as she herself, despite the fact that Lys
   never attended the rituals.

   It is possible that renti is a compound form comprising re ‘please’. The form *nti in isolation is unattested.
73
   It is not clear what Ais Mawe means here, but she seems to imply that those people who gave ceremonial
   cloth were allowed to advise the women in the fnia m-kiar rituals.
74
   In addition to the male family members, there was a group of men giving advice as well.
75
   M-fe is a predicative form. Literally, the last part of the utterance reads ‘... only the advice of your brothers
   and your uncles, it is not.’
76
   It is not clear what Ais Mawe means here.
77
   It is not clear why here a masculine form fi-t-ait is used.
78
   Wiahae refers to the taboo there is on marrying relatives. It is said that this is not allowed, because then
   the ceremonial cloths that are given to the family of the female by the family of the male do not travel
   around widely. If two people are related, then the number of relatives from which cloths can be collected
   becomes limited.
79
   Here, Ais Mawe asks us what else we want to know.

   Both ita and m-ata were given as equivalents for ‘leaf’. Sometimes they are used in combination, to refer
   to ‘leaf’.
81
   That is, women who have already been initiated.
82
   Sinat is Macaranga sp., the leaves were formerly used as napkins.
83
   The term sno to refer to ‘day’ is unattested in the rest of the data. It probably belongs to a northern dialect.
84
   This is an example of an exclusive form which is expressed with a second person plural subject prefix and
   a first person plural subject prefix on the verb (see §4.1.1).

   In this sentence there is a shift from the third person plural to the first person plural, possibly to create
   some distance from the events that she describes, but also experiences herself.
86
   ‘This thing’ refers to menstruation. In the course of the following fragment, Ais Mawe tells us that one of
   the aims of fnia m-kiar was to prevent women from menstruating.
87
   Here it turns out that the ratau, mentioned from the beginning onwards, is given to the young women in
   order to stop menstruation. It seems that the men wanted control over the flow of blood. As far as I
   understood, the ratau did not enhance or stop the fertility of the women.
88
   At this point, Lys mentions menstrual blood in order to clarify Ais Mawe’s meaning to me.

   This is one of the few instances where an Indonesian verb receives a Maybrat subject prefix. Moreover, it
   is polysyllabic, with a C-initial stem, so according to Maybrat morphophonemic rules, it should not
   receive an overt subject prefix.
90
   At this point in the interview I am confused about the term pofit, which is also used to refer to malicious
   spells put on people to, for instance, kill them. Only initiated men, who have learned about the secrets of
   Wuon, know everything about these spells. Pofit ‘ginger (Zinfiber officinale)’ and pofit ‘poison’ seem to
   be metonyms.
91
   Raria is Ais Mawe’s adaptation of Indonesian halia ‘ginger’ (see also §2.8).
92
   Apparently one of the uses of ginger for women is to place it in a newly-burnt garden, in order to make the
   garden more fertile.

                   Appendix III
                     Siwa y-sia y-ao Mafif ‘Siwa and his brother Mafif’
   This story was told by Petrus Turot, 39 years old, who lives in Ayawasi with his family.
As a small child he lived in the area around Konya, that is slightly to the north of Ayawasi.
   The stories of Siwa and Mafif are well known among the Maybrat (see, for instance,
Miedema 1998). Siwa is a culture-hero, who is also seen as the creator of the universe.
This story gives an account of the creation of some mountains. Because Siwa is a creator,
he is sometimes equated to yfun ‘God’.1 Mafif is a normal human being. Most Siwa and
Mafif stories are about how Siwa always plays tricks on Mafif. At the beginning of the
story, Petrus Turot gives an introduction to the identity of Siwa and Mafif.
   The story was recorded using a walkman and a separate microphone, at a house in
Ayawasi. It was transcribed with the help of Petrus Turot himself. As opposed to the texts
in Appendix I and II, pauses are not indicated in this text.
   Below, only the first part of the story told by Petrus is given. The remainder of the story

     -ao are all family members of the same sex in the following categories: (a) siblings; (b) children of
     mother’s and father’s siblings; (c) some cousins. -ano (viz. line 5) are all family members in the same
     categories, but of the opposite sex. Friends may also be referred to as -ao and -ano, with the sex
     distinction as described above. See Appendix IV for a kinship diagram.

     A rae popot is a man, usually quite old, who possesses a lot of ‘ceremonial cloth’ (po). Rae popot are
     usually also wise, and know a lot about the whereabouts of other ceremonial cloths. Because of this, they
     often have a lot of influence in the community.

     The expression um s-au literally ‘one time’ is a discourse feature used to introduce myths, or traditional
     stories. I have translated it as ‘once upon a time’.
5
     Y-me ‘his mother’ may refer to the woman who gave birth to Siwa, but also to other women in the family
     (see Appendix IV).
6
     M-tien po ‘They look for ceremonial cloth’ is an idiomatic expression.
7
     Tein ‘abandoned garden’ is used to refer to a period of approximately one year (see §5.1.3, footnote 4).
8
     The system of exchange of ceremonial cloth is intricate: giving to someone does not automatically entail
     that one is entitled to cloth in return, as seems to be the case here for Siwa and his mother.
9
     The prefix k- originates from a dialect to the north of Ayawasi. K- seems to express emphasis. In Ayawasi,
     this is not a standard form.

10
   In these two lines, the speaker explains lines 12 and 13.
11
   In the spoken text there is a pause between au ø-sokuos and y-me fo ø-sokuos. The speaker started his
   sentence again to make the referent, y-me ‘his mother’ more explicit.
12
   Po aof ‘sago thing’ refers to the treebark, which will be used as a bowl to stir the sago later on.
13
   The verb -tu ‘pour’ refers to the fact that in order to make sago porridge, boiling water has to be poured
   onto the sago while stirring vigorously. The stirring of the sago, while it is still in liquid form, is referred
   to as -som ‘play’ (line 23). The stirred mixture of water and sago then ‘runs’, -hoh (line 25). The instant
   the mixture becomes porridge is called aof m-hai, lit. ‘The sago dies’ (line 26).
14
   Here, a temporal adverbial receives a subject prefix. M-orie is used predicatively, and is adequately
   translated as an interjection meaning ‘Wait!’.
15
   M-akan m-ah literally means ‘seeds appear’.
16
   The term aro ‘other’ may literally refer to other things, but may also be used as a gap-filler, as is the case
   here.

   -a is possibly a dialectal variant (from the area to the north of Ayawasi) of -au ‘DIST.U’ (see also line 46).
18
   M-api ø-pria, lit. ‘everything was old’, is adequately translated as ‘very old’ in this context.
19
   Y-pron is an irregular form, since it receives an overt person prefix. According to the morphophonological
   constraints stated in §3.1.2, this form should receive a covert person prefix.
20
   The water is heated in bamboo. In order to pour it out, the bamboo has to be lifted up with two hands and
   held horizontally and tilted slowly down towards the open end in order to pour out the water, hence the
   form -awah ‘lift (with two hands)’.
21
   That is, he pours and stirs the mixture of sago and water on his mother’s stomach, in order to make
   porridge.
22
   That is, the mixture on the woman’s stomach moved all the time.

   This is an irregular form: potu consists of two syllables, and one would expect it to take a covert person

   This form is also used in Appendix II, fnia m-kiar, lines 11, 43, 44, 45.

   Both watah and afos (see next line) refer to specific types of treebark, but both are unattested in the

   It is unclear why s-au ‘one’ is used here. It possibly refers to the fact that Siwa carried it in one piece.

   The expression ø-skur ø-trat refers to opening something up completely. According to the
   morphophonemic patterns in Maybrat, the verb ø-skur, with its C-initial stem, should not receive an overt
   subject prefix. In the text it does.
29
   -ama ‘come’ is used because the place where the story was told (i.e. Ayawasi) is called Tapam Hapeh (see

            3M-write
            ‘He writes.’4.2.3.2 Motion verbs and position verbs
   Motion verbs and position verbs occur in verb sequences which seem coordinating, but
which differ from coordinating constructions according to one important criterion, namely
they do not conform to the Coordinate Structure Constraint (Ross 1967). This constraint
stipulates that it is not permitted to extract objects out of a coordinating construction. Verb
sequences that involve motion verbs and position verbs typically violate this constraint,
hence the subclassification. Extraction of objects out of constructions that include these
verbs is discussed extensively in §8.7.
   The verbs that exhibit this different syntactic behaviour in sequences of verbs are given
below. This list is not intended to be exhaustive:
(73)        motion verbs:
            -amo       ‘go’
            -ama       ‘come’
(74)        position verbs:
            -ros        ‘stand’
            -hu         ‘stay’
            hren        ‘sit’
   Each of these verbs can be used as a regular transitive verb with a nominal object. Some
examples:
(75)        y-amo amah
            3U-go house
            ‘He goes to the house.’
(76)        m-hu ora          r-au
            3U-stay garden POSS-3U
            ‘She stays in her garden.’
     Examples of some of these verbs in verb sequences are given below:
(77) a.     t-amo t-ate       aya
            1S-go 1S-bathe water
            ‘I go and bathe in the river.’
       b.   ø-hren y-kias po-mna
            ø-sit    3M-tell NOM-tell.tale
            ‘He sits and tells a tale.’4.2.3.3 ‘Shared argument construction’ verbs
   The verbs in (78) are assigned to a separate class because they can occur in so-called
‘shared argument constructions’. These are constructions of the type ‘X verb1 Y verb2 (Z)’,
in which Y functions both as the object of verb1 and as the subject of verb2.
                                                                          Word classes     77(78)     -o          ‘take’
         -po         ‘hold’
         -ehoh       ‘stab’
   In (79)–(81) these verbs function like regular transitive verbs:
(79)     t-o        tfo
         1S-take machete
         ‘I take a machete.’
(80)     y-po      ku     ø-kiniah
         3M-hold child ø-small
         ‘He holds the small child.’
(81)     m-ehoh fane
         3U-stab pig
         ‘She stabs the pig.’
  Sentences (82) and (83) give examples of some of these verbs in a shared argument
construction.
(82)     t-tu     aya     m-amo cerek
         1s-pour water 3u-go thermos.flask
         ‘I pour water into the thermos flask.’
(83)     t-ehoh kau m-hai
         1S-stab rat 3U-die
         ‘I kill the rat.’ (lit. ‘I stab the rat and it dies.’)
   What these verb sequences have in common with verb sequences involving motion
verbs and position verbs is that they also violate the CSC. The syntactic behaviour of these
verb sequences is described in §8.7.","[93, 94, 95]"
"4.3.2 Alienably possessed nouns
   Alienably possessed nouns are those forms which cannot take person prefixes. In other
words, unlike the inalienably possessed nouns, the possessor of an alienably possessed
noun is not marked on the noun.
   In possessive constructions where the alienably possessed noun is the possessed, the
order of the constituents is possessed-possessor, where the possessor is preceded by the
possessive marker ro. Some examples:
(157)       amah ro-Petrus
            house POSS-Petrus
            ‘Petrus’ house’
(158)       amah ro-t-atia
            house POSS-1S-father
            ‘my father’s house’
(159)       po-ø-satoh      r-au
            NOM-ø-collect POSS-3U
            ‘her possessions’
(160)       fane ro-Yan
            pig POSS-Yan
            ‘Yan’s pig’
     See §5.2 for a more detailed treatment of possessive constructions.",[107]
"8.1.3.2 Scope of interrogative
   Foley and van Valin (1984:208) use, among other criteria, the scope of what they term
‘operators’ (categories of verb inflection, tense, mood etc.) over junctures in order to
determine the particular type of juncture. Negation as a test is often used in the literature
(for example Foley & Olson 1985:27), but I have omitted it here.4 The reason for this is
that despite the fact that the types of verb sequences are different, they all behave similarly
when negated.
   In coordinating sequences of verbs, that is those where each verb constitutes a separate
clause, it is expected that each conjunct can independently take peripheral operators. That
is, the scope of these operators can be over just one conjunct (Foley & van Valin
1984:244). This is confirmed in examples (19)–(21) below. Each example is ambiguous:
the scope of the interrogative can be either over the entire construction (reading 1.) or over
the final verb (reading 2.). In each case, reading 1. is the preferred interpretation. Note that
the scope of the interrogator can never exclude the final conjunct in the series. So, in (21),
the interrogation can never have as its scope m-ko tafoh; saruk po-iit; or m-ko tafoh saruk
po-iit alone.5
(19)        ø-satoh                naf         ø-kmuk       awiah a
            ø-collect.belongings taro.shoot ø-cut.short taro INT
            1. ‘Do they collect their taro shoots and cut taro?’
            2. ‘They collect their taro shoots, but do they cut taro?’
(20)        ku y-awia mati           rae    m-e       biskui a
            child 3M-cry and.then person 3U-give biscuit INT
            1. ‘Does the boy cry and does someone give him a biscuit?’
            2. ‘The boy cries, but does someone give him a biscuit?’
(21)        m-ko     tafoh ø-saruk po-iit        m-wian aya       a
            3U-burn fire ø-cook NOM-eat.P 3U-scoop water INT
            1. ‘Does she burn a fire, cook food and scoop water?’
            2. ‘She burns a fire and cooks food but does she scoop water?’
   Unlike in the indicative mood, intonation can be distinctive in coordinating sequences in
the interrogative mood. Compare example (22) below with (19). In (22), a pause separates
the two conjuncts, and there is a drop in pitch at the end of each conjunct. Unlike (19), (22)
cannot be ambiguous, as the scope of the interrogator can only be over the last conjunct.",[209]
"4.8.3 Other forms with to
   There are two spatial nouns preceded by to ‘LOC’ namely: to m-ato, as in (336) and
(337), and to m-apuo (338). Example (336) is structurally analogous to forms including
122       Chapter 4‘to+N’, as in (314)–(316). In (337) and (338), however, ‘to+spatial noun’ is followed by
yet another noun. In these examples, ‘to+spatial noun’ + N expresses a prepositional
notion. In the following section I present evidence which suggests the appearance of
prepositions.
(336)       ana ø-twok m-tien        to    m-ato
            3P ø-enter 3U-sleep LOC 3U-hole
            ‘They enter and they sleep inside.’
(337)       fane m-sia      ku      r-au      to     m-ato m-sif
            pig 3U-with child POSS-3U LOC 3U-hole 3U-nest
            ‘The pig with her children are inside the nest.’
(338)       y-he    y-amo ø-frok       to   m-apuo ana
            3M-see 3M-go ø-emerge LOC 3U-tip fence
            ‘He looks and he goes and emerges at the tip of the fence.’4.8.4 Prepositional behaviour of some locational forms
   The locative adverbs akah ‘above’ and ete ‘below’ and the directional tis ‘behind’ can
follow a noun, as illustrated in (339)–(340). In this respect akah, ete and tis are
syntactically similar to the spatial nouns, which occur in possessive constructions in which
the spatial noun follows the head noun (see §4.3.1).
(339)       y-hu      ara akah
            3M-stay tree above
            ‘He is in the top of the tree.’ (lit. ‘the tree’s “above”’)
(340)       fiam     aya     ete68
            catfish water below
            ‘There are catfish under the water.’ (lit. ‘the water’s “below”’)
(341)       smai m-ae amah tis
            bean 3u-at house behind
            ‘The beans are behind the house.’ (lit. ‘at the house’s “behind”’)
     Recall that akah and ete (but not tis) can also precede a noun, see also (295) and (296):
(342)       ku y-ros        akah meja
            child 3M-stand above table
            ‘The child stands on the table.’
(343)       wata      m-hu ete         aya
            fish.trap 3U-stay below water
            ‘The fish trap is under water.’
   The syntactic behaviour of akah and ete in genitival constructions may be an indication
that these forms were once spatial nouns, and are now being grammaticalised into
prepositions. It is conceivable that during this grammaticalisation process, a putative
person prefix m- was lost, since many grammaticalisation processes go together with a
loss of morphology (Hopper 1991:22). Also, during a grammaticalisation process, the
68
     This is a nominal clause. See §6.5 for a discussion on nominal clauses.
                                                                      Word classes    123categorial status of a form may be unclear. This would explain why the prepositions akah
and ete can occur both in front of a noun, which is typically prepositional behaviour, and
following a noun, parallelling the behaviour of inalienably possessed nouns. Processes
whereby nouns that semantically refer to space undergo a change in morphosyntactic status
are well attested in other languages (cf. Heine et al. 1991:3, 136; Svorou 1993:100–101).
   But akah and ete are not the only forms that show ‘prepositional’ behaviour. In the
previous sections, I showed that ‘to’, ‘to+directional’ and ‘to+spatial noun’ can all be
followed by a noun. A summary of forms is given below:
(344)   y-amo to      Sorong
        3M-go LOC Sorong
        ‘He goes to Sorong.’
(345)   au ø-hren to-tis           amah
        3U ø-sit      LOC-behind house
        ‘She sits behind the house.’
(346)   t-se        to    m-ato     lemari
        1S-place LOC 3U-hole cupboard
        ‘I place it inside the cupboard.’4.9 Coordinators
  Coordinators are words that are used to link clauses. In Maybrat, the following
coordinators can be identified:
(347)   mati       ‘and then’
        na         ‘and then’
        ke         ‘because’
        mi         ‘so that’
        re         ‘in order to’
   These coordinators all occur as free morphemes. Semantically, mati and na indicate
sequentiality of actions; ke, mi and re mark purpose and reason relationships between
clauses. Some examples of these coordinators in a sentence are:
(348)   t-amo Sorong mati          ø-tim am
        1S-go Sorong and.then ø-send letter
        ‘I go to Sorong and then I send a letter.’
(349)   m-aut     na       m-kai      apan
        3U-climb and.then 3U-meet snake
        ‘They climb and then they find a snake.’
(350)   Potafit ait y-apo fe            ke          ø-okair
        Potafit 3M 3M-eat NEG because ø-little
        ‘Potafit, he does not eat because there is little (food).’
        (lit. ‘because it (the food) is a little.’)
(351)   tuo t-awe ku          y-hai awiah mi            y-awia
        1S 1S-say child 3M-die taro so.that 3M-cry
        ‘I think the child is hungry so that he is crying.’
124     Chapter 4(352)    t-amo amah ø-kiyam re                    suster m-he       t-ao
         1S-go house ø-ill          in.order.to sister 3U-see 1S-foot
         ‘I go to the hospital in order for the sister to look at my foot.’
   The syntactic behaviour of coordinators is further discussed in §9.1.","[139, 140, 141, 142]"
"4.1.1 Person prefixes
   In §3.1, I introduced the person prefixes, and the morphophonological constraints that
dictate whether or not they are phonologically expressed. The person prefixes are repeated
below:
(1)                     free form     bound form
        S     1           tuo           t-

              3M          ait           y-
              3U          au            m-
        P     1          amu             p-
              2          anu             n-
              3          ana             m-
                                                                                      Word classes    63   Possibly, the first and second person singular bound forms are derived from the
respective free forms. For the other forms, there does not seem to be an overt
morphological connection between the bound forms and the free forms. In the free forms
of the plural pronouns, the first phoneme is invariably /a/, while the second is a nasal.
   Person prefixes are taken by verbs and inalienably possessed nouns. There is subject
agreement, that is in clauses the person prefix on the verb must be coreferent with the
subject of the clause — see an example in (2) — and inalienably possessed nouns take a
person prefix that agrees with the possessor of the noun (3).
(2) a.     ait y-amo               b.    nuo n-amo
           3M 3M-go                      2S 2-go
           ‘he goes’                     ‘you go’
(3) a.     t-ana                   b.    y-ana
           1S-head                       3M-head
           ‘my head’                     ‘his head’
   Because words from two different word classes take these person prefixes, the presence
of a person prefix cannot be used as the sole criterion to classify a word. Therefore,
syntactic criteria are needed as well, as will be illustrated in the course of the discussion on
verbs and nouns.
   There is a distinction in gender, namely between masculine and unmarked in the third
person singular pronoun in both the free forms and the bound forms. Gender is according
to natural gender: masculine is used for male human and, for instance in fables, male
animate. In both cases, the referent must be singular:
(4)        rae y-amo aya1
           man 3M-go water
           ‘The man goes to the river.’
(5)        fane y-tien
           pig 3M-sleep
           ‘The boar sleeps.’
   The unmarked bound form m- is used to refer to all third person forms that do not fall
under the heading ‘masculine human singular’, that is all other third person singular and
plural forms. Some examples:
(6)        fai    m-haif  rako2
           woman 3U-chop firewood
           ‘The woman/women chop(s) firewood.’
(7)        ru m-amo Senopi
           bird 3U-go Senopi
           ‘The aeroplane/aeroplanes3 go(es) to Senopi.’
(8)        fane m-aku       m-som
           pig 3U-small 3U-play
           ‘The piglet/piglets play(s).’1
    Aya is used to refer to ‘water’ and ‘river’. In this work, I have translated aya as ‘water’.
2
    Rako is a lexicalised compound noun, consisting of the noun ara ‘wood’ and the verb -ko ‘burn’.
3
    Ru ‘bird’ is also used to refer to ‘aeroplane’.
64     Chapter 4   Gender in nouns is further discussed in §4.3.3.
   The examples in (6)–(8) can be interpreted as both singular and plural, because the
person prefix m- is ambiguous in this respect. The only instances of third person forms in
which the distinction between singular and plural is clear are those where the subject of the
clause (or the possessor in case of an inalienably possessed noun) is masculine human: cf.
(4) and (9):
(9)        rae m-amo aya
           man 3U-go water
           ‘The men go to the river.’
   The form in (10) can refer to singular and plural: a way to disambiguate this is by using
a personal pronoun explicitly, as illustrated in (11) and (12):4
(10)       fnia   m-amo aya
           woman 3U-go water
           ‘The woman/women go to the river.’
(11)       fnia   au m-amo aya
           woman 3U 3U-go water
           ‘The woman goes to the river.’
(12)       fnia   ana m-amo aya
           woman 3P 3U-go water
           ‘The women go to the river.’
   The unmarked free form au may refer to both humans and inanimates. For instance, the
referent of the subject au ‘3U’ in (13) below is an aeroplane.
(13)       au m-aut          oh
           3U 3U-climb already
           ‘It has already taken off.’ (lit. ‘It already climbed.’)
    Maybrat makes no morphological distinction between inclusive and exclusive in the
first person plural.5 It is, however, possible to distinguish between the two by combining
the free and the bound pronominal forms. When amu, the first person plural free personal
pronoun, is followed by a verb with a first person plural person prefix p-, this refers to a
group of people including the speaker but excluding the listener, for example (14).
Semantically, this is the ‘exclusive’ form. The second person plural personal pronoun anu,
followed by a verb with a second person prefix n-, is used to refer to a group of people
excluding the speaker, that is the ‘second person plural’, as in (15). The semantic
‘inclusive’ form is expressed by using the free pronoun anu followed by a verb that takes a
first person plural person prefix p-, as illustrated in (16).","[80, 81, 82]"
"19
   The naming for groups of people is rather confusing: the people of Ayata, for instance, were referred to as
   rae asmaun by the people of Ayawasi. However, the people of Ayata objected to this and in turn referred
   to the people living to the east of them (in Aynesra) as rae asmaun. I did not manage to grasp this way of
   giving names.
20
   The Indonesian used is actually an East Indonesian variant of Indonesian, referred to as Malay, which is
   spoken as the lingua franca in large parts of East Indonesia, including Papua (cf. van Minde 1997:8, 9;
   Wurm & Hattori 1982: Map 46).
21
   When I lived in Ayawasi, Father J. Fatem, a Maybrat speaker from Ayata, occasionally held his sermon in
   Maybrat.
22
   I have not studied what the motivations are for using Indonesian, even in circumstances where the
   equivalent of what one wants to say is available in Maybrat.
8    Chapter 1   Many notions which in, for instance, English and Dutch are expressed by prepositions
are expressed by verbs in Maybrat, although it is obvious from the morphological and
syntactic behaviour of these Maybrat forms that they are less ‘verby’ than their true verbal
counterparts.
   Syntactically, the most striking feature of Maybrat is the occurrence of verb sequences.
Despite their formal similarity, a distinction between several different types of sequence
can be made.
   The present description is based on the language as it is spoken in Ayawasi. However,
as I mentioned earlier, Ayawasi is a relatively new village. Until it was formed, the people
used to live in small groups on their ancestral grounds. The language they spoke was the
same, but small (mainly lexical) differences occurred from one family to another.23 When
these families moved to Ayawasi, they each brought their own ‘family dialect’ with them.
The people who originally lived in the area where Ayawasi is now built have the following
family names: Tenau, Yumte, Kosho. Older people, especially, who are originally from
areas further away from Ayawasi can often be identified as such on the basis of their
speech. This is illustrated in a lot of the recorded tales: for example, four terms were found
in Ayawasi to denote one and the same animal, ‘cassowary’, but all originate from a
different area, namely posakof (originally from Mosun), kakru (originally from Pori,
formerly at one hour walking distance from Ayawasi, but now attached to Ayawasi),
ru kair (Ayawasi), and pohoho (unclear origin). In the younger generation, raised in
Ayawasi, lexical differences were not as pronounced as in the older generations. In other
words, Ayawasi is a melting pot of a number of different, but very closely related, ‘family
dialects’, which over 30 years have become more alike. In the description, I have indicated
the forms which are clearly ‘family dialectal’.","[25, 26]"
"4.2.3.6 Comitative
   The comitative, marked by the verb -sia, is used to conjoin NPs. Adequate translations
of -sia are ‘and’, ‘with’ or ‘accompanied by’. When -sia takes both a subject and an object,
the resulting constituent can function as an argument in a clause. An example is given in
(108), where tuo t-sia ait functions as the subject of the predicate p-mo.
(108)        tuo t-sia    ait p-mo Mosun
             1S 1S-with 3M 1P-go.P Mosun
             ‘I go to Mosun with him.’ (lit. ‘I with him, we go to Mosun.’)
(109)        t-amo Mosun t-sia       Lys
             1S-go Mosun 1S-with Lys
             ‘I go to Mosun with Lys.’
   The verb -sia is similar to the verbs expressing oblique notions in two ways: -sia cannot
function as a main verb, and -sia rarely occurs without an object. The morphological and
syntactic properties of -sia are described in detail in §8.5.",[99]
"
8.4.1 Another note on ‘prepositions’
   In §4.2.3.5 I showed that with the exception of -ae, the prepositional verbs cannot
function as main verbs in a clause although two of them, -kit and -pat, do take person
prefixes like regular verbs. In §8.4 I illustrated that, when placed in a sequence with other
verbs, the resulting sequences behave differently from coordinating sequences of verbs.
13
   Unless there is a rise in pitch on the first verb followed by a pause, in which case m-ae hanggar would be
   emphasised, see (87)–(90).
14
   It may seem odd that the b-form below is acceptable, as opposed to (105b) and (106b) which are not. A
   possible explanation is that in the example below m-ae Ayawasi is interpreted as a separate clause, where
   m-ae functions as a main verb:
      a. ana m-amo m-ae Ayawasi                        b. [[Ayawasi ro       m-amo Ø]] m-ae kait Ayata
          3P 3U-go 3U-at Ayawasi                            Ayawasi REL 3U-go              3U-at near Ayata
          ‘They go to Ayawasi.’                            ‘Ayawasi, that they go to, is near Ayata.’
                                                                   Sequences of verbs     209Prepositional verbs seem to be less ‘verby’ than other verbs, with m-kah as the most
remarkable form, since its verbal character is debatable to begin with (see §4.2.3.5 for the
arguments to classify it as a verb).
   Prepositional notions that are expressed by forms which are verbal in character to a
greater or lesser extent are found in many (serialising) languages. Lord (1973) finds that in
a number of Kwa languages, spoken in West Africa, some prepositions evolved from
locative verbs in a serial construction. Hamel (1993), in her description of Loniu, an
Oceanic language, finds that oblique roles such as locatives, causatives and instrument/
manner constructions are expressed by prepositions that are derived from verbs, but have
lost some of their verbal properties. Schachter (1974:265) states that verbs that occur in
serial verb constructions often lose their verbal characteristics resulting in a
‘reinterpretation as prepositions’. Disregarding for the moment the question of whether the
verb sequences described in the present section qualify as ‘serial verb constructions’ (I will
return to this in §8.7 and §8.8), the behaviour of Maybrat prepositional verbs is, from a
typological point of view, not unusual.
   The question is whether these verbs should be analysed as prepositions or as verbs. Lord
(1993) gives a number of criteria that have to be met for a verbal form to qualify as a
preposition (Lord 1993:14). These criteria refer to the extent to which such verbal forms
are verbal in behaviour. In Maybrat, -ae can function as a main verb, whereas -kit, -pat and
-kah cannot. However, Lord states that objects of verbs can be extracted, whereas those of
prepositions cannot. According to this criterion then, -kit and -pat are more ‘verbal’ than
-ae and -kah, as the former two verbs allow relativisation of their objects more easily than
the latter two verbs. Likewise, -kit and -pat are more verbal than -ae and -kah because of
their ability to select nouns as subjects: as was illustrated above, -ae is sometimes, and
-kah is always a ‘defective paradigm’ verb. The ability to select a noun as a subject, which
with the exception of -kah all verbs clearly can do, is another property associated with
verbs, according to Lord.
   It is clear that the ‘prepositional’ verbs in Maybrat are not exclusively prepositions, but
at the same time, they are not exclusively verbs, as they do not fully exhibit some of the
properties that are so typical of ‘real’ Maybrat verbs, such as the ability to function as a
main verb and the ability to take person prefixes.","[226, 227]"
"4.2.3.4 Complement-taking verbs
   There are a number of different types of verbs that can take either a nominal object or a
clausal object. These are the causative verb -no ‘do’; the verb -awe ‘say’; ‘perception
verbs’, as in (84); and ‘mental activity verbs’, as in (85). The distinction between these two
types is purely semantic. These lists are not intended to be exhaustive.
(84)     -ari         ‘hear’
         -he          ‘see’
         -nin         ‘smell’
         -not         ‘think’
(85)     hawe         ‘refuse’
         -oa          ‘not know’
         -sam         ‘be afraid’
         skoh         ‘enjoy’
         winaut       ‘hope’
   In (86a) an example involving -no with a nominal object is given. In the corresponding
b-example this verb has a clausal object, namely y-awe ‘He falls.’.
78      Chapter 4(86) a.      t-no po       m-kair
             1S-do thing 3U-bad
             ‘I do something bad.’
       b.    t-no y-awe
             1S-do 3M-fall
             ‘I make him fall.’
   Causative constructions are described in §8.3.
   In (87a) the verb -awe ‘say’ (-awe ‘fall’ and -awe ‘say’ are homophones) takes a clausal
object. The verb -awe can also occur with a nominal object, see (87b).
(87) a.      y-awe y-aut        ara15
             3M-say 3M-climb tree
             ‘He says he climbs into the tree.’/‘He wants to climb into the tree.’
       b.    y-awe po
             3M-say thing
             ‘He says something.’
   As illustrated in (87a), the verb -awe can refer to the act of ‘saying’ as well as to the
thought content of the speaker. In the latter usage, I call these forms ‘pseudo quotative
constructions’. See §8.3.2 for a description of the semantic and syntactic characteristics of
pseudo-quotative constructions.
   An example of a perception verb and a mental activity verb with a nominal object
follows:
(88)         t-he      rae
             1S-see person
             ‘I see a man.’
(89)         tuo ø-skoh nuo
             1S ø-enjoy 2S
             ‘I like you.’
  The verb -ari includes a range of meanings: -ari can be translated as ‘hear’, as in (90)
and (91):
(90)         m-ari    rae     m-asi toya
             3u-hear person 3u-sing song
             ‘She hears people singing a song.’
(91)         t-ari    rae     m-kias, t-ari     rae       m-nit
             1S-hear person 3U-talk 1S-hear person 3U-tell
             ‘I hear people talking, I hear people telling.’
   Apart from ‘hear’, -ari also has a more generic meaning, namely ‘to feel’ or ‘to perceive
involuntarily’, as illustrated in (92)–(94). This phenomenon is also attested in other Papuan
languages, for instance in Usan, a language spoken in the Madang province in Papua New
Guinea. In this language, the verb igub can take an object which semantically refers to
15
     Ara is used to refer to ‘tree’ and ‘wood’. In this work, I have translated ara as ‘tree’.
                                                                                        Word classes        79sound, in which case it means ‘hear’. However, when it is translated as ‘smell’, igub refers
to an uncontrolled (involuntary) act (Reesink 1987:135–136).
(92)        t-ari     t-fos
            1S-hear 1S-wind16
            ‘I feel cold.’
(93)        t-ari      m-kair
            1S-hear 3U-bad
            ‘I feel it is bad (it feels bad).’
(94)        t-ari     fra     m-ami       t-ao
            1S-hear stone 3U-pierce 1S-foot
            ‘I feel a stone piercing my foot.’
   In (95) and (96) examples of sentences involving perception verbs which take an object
complement are given. In (95) fai m-amo ‘the woman goes’ functions as the object of t-he;
in (96) t-amo ora ‘I go to the garden’ functions as the object of (96).
(95)        t-he      fai    m-amo
            1S-see woman 3U-go
            ‘I see the woman go.’
(96)        ø-skoh t-amo ora
            ø-enjoy 1S-go garden
            ‘I enjoy going to the garden.’
   Sequences of verbs involving perception verbs and mental activity verbs, and the
syntactic behaviour of these sequences, are described in detail in §8.3.","[95, 96, 97]"
"4.2.3.5 Prepositional verbs
   There are a number of prepositional notions that are expressed by forms which are
morphologically verbs. These include locative verbs, and the verb -kah, which
semantically covers the notion of ‘involvement with (object)’. In more traditional terms,
-kah can be translated as instrumental/recipient/benefactive.
(97)        -ae         ‘at’
            -kit        ‘towards’
            -pat        ‘from’
            -kah        ‘with’/‘to’/‘for’
   Although these verbs are similar to transitive verbs, they are less ‘verby’. There are
three features which distinguish these verbs from the other transitive verbs.
   First, the only verb that is attested as a main verb is -ae ‘at’, as in (98). The other verbs
cannot function as main verbs, as illustrated for -kit in (99).
(98)        y-ae Sorong
            3M-at Sorong
            ‘He is in Sorong.’16
     Fos can also function as a noun meaning ‘wind’, e.g. fos m-fi ‘the wind blows’. Semantically, the noun fos
     ‘wind’ and the verb stem -fos in t-fos ‘I am cold’ seem related.
80      Chapter 4(99)         *t-kit     ora
             1s-towards garden
   The verbs -kit and -pat always take a person prefix that is coreferent with the subject of
the preceding verb:
(100)        y-amo y-kit            aof  r-ait
             3M-go 3M-towards sago.tree POSS-3M
             ‘He goes to his sago tree.’
(101)        p-ma      p-pat     ora     ro-Sely    m-me
             1P-come.P 1p-from garden POSS-Sely 3U-mother
             ‘We come from Sely’s mother’s garden.’
   Second, unlike -kit and -pat, -ae may, and -kah must have a defective paradigm, taking
a third person unmarked person prefix m- which is not in agreement with the subject of the
clause. Because -ae can also function as a main verb, an acceptable contrast can be made
with a defective paradigm verb as in (102a) and an inflected verb as in (102b). This is not
the case for -kah in (103). In fact, it is debatable whether -kah should be classified as
a verb at all. The reason for assuming it is a verb is twofold: first, mkah occurs in
constructions similar to those with the other prepositional verbs, that is preceded by
another verb, and invariably followed by an NP which functions as the object of the
prepositional verb. Second, the form -ae occurs in two guises: one with a declining
paradigm and one with a defective paradigm. I assume by analogy that mkah is also a
defective paradigm verb, thus morphologically m-kah, where the putative declining variety
has become obsolete.
(102) a.      ait y-amo m-ae amah
              he 3M-go 3U-at house
              ‘He goes home.’
        b.    ait y-amo y-ae amah
              he 3M-go 3U-at house
              ‘He goes and he is at home.’
(103) a.      t-ai    m-kah ara
              1S-hit 3U-with tree
              ‘I hit with a stick.’
        b.    *t-ai t-kah     ara
               1S-hit 1S-with stick
    The verb -kah can function as a main verb meaning ‘wear’. This is illustrated in (104).
It can also occur in a sequence of verbs, as in (105) and (106).
(104)        t-kah     onfuk17
             1S-wear clothes
             ‘I wear clothes.’
17
     Onfuk is possibly derived from po n-fuk <thing 2-wear> ‘thing you wear’.
                                                                              Word classes   81(105)        tuo t-amo t-kah       onfuk
             1S 1S-go 1S-wear clothes
             ‘I go and I wear clothes.’
(106)        y-ama    y-kah    po-ø-fayir
             3M-come 3M-wear NOM-ø-decorate
             ‘He comes and he wears decorations.’
   It is conceivable that -kah ‘wear’ and -kah in the meaning ‘with’ derive from one single
morpheme, given their semantic similarity: a less fluent English translation of (106), for
example, could be ‘He comes and he is with decorations’, but both meanings are closely
related. I therefore assume that there is a link between -kah ‘wear’ and -kah ‘with’. It is not
clear, however, how -kah ‘with’ has come to include a recipient and benefactive function
as well, that is, if we assume that they are one and the same morpheme.
   Third, unlike transitive verbs, from which an object can be omitted, prepositional verbs
invariably occur with an object. Omitting this object results in an ungrammatical utterance,
see (107b).
(107) a.      m-ama    m-pat   Mosun
              3U-come 3U-from Mosun
              ‘They come from Mosun.’
        b.    *m-ama m-pat
               3U-come 3U-from
   Thus, prepositional verbs seem to be less ‘verby’ than other transitive verbs. As such,
their verbal status is questionable. The syntactic behaviour of prepositional verbs is
described in detail in §8.4.","[97, 98, 99]"
"1.8 Fieldwork
   The reason for selecting Ayawasi as a site for fieldwork was threefold. Firstly, Ayawasi,
with its large and almost completely bilingual community, is a good place to collect
language data. Secondly, some anthropological fieldwork had already been conducted in
Ayawasi, resulting in an ethnography (Schoorl 1979, see also §1.5). Thirdly, from a
practical point of view, the people at the missionary post were willing to assist at the
beginning of the fieldwork period, and, Ayawasi has an airstrip providing some access to
the township of Sorong. Because I found many good informants in Ayawasi, I decided to
collect the bulk of my data there.
   Fieldwork was conducted in two periods, from September 1993 to February 1995 and
from October 1995 to March 1996. Initially Indonesian was used as the contact language.
A start was made with acquiring a basic knowledge of Maybrat in the form of words,
greetings, short questions that could be asked in the village, and short sentences.
Subsequently, a word list of 700 lexical items was recorded, as well as three short stories.
A number of people were asked to help transcribe and translate the texts. In the meantime,
I acquired enough oral proficiency to conduct conversations.
   After having formulated preliminary hypotheses about the phonology, morphology and
syntax of the language, more texts were recorded, transcribed, and translated with the help
of several people. These texts were analysed and any queries were discussed with
12     Chapter 1informants. The texts were used as the basis for the elicitation of new material:
constructions or features that were not understood, or that required more data, were
elaborated on with informants. Some of this elicitation was done by constructing sentences,
and asking a native speaker to improve them.
    Most of the data were entered into two computer databases: for the analysis of the
phonological data the programme ‘FindPhone’ was used and for interlinearising texts the
programme ‘Shoebox’.28 The initial phonological analysis was based on 900 forms in the
database, and was later supplemented by more material. The Shoebox programme
contained over 2700 types of words. Eventually the recorded and written text material
totalled over 45.000 tokens (approximately sixty typed pages).
    In addition to the material entered into the digital databases, a concordance was made
by hand, based on the collected texts. This concordance included examples of different
sentence types, instances of lexical items that were not yet fully understood, instances of
the use of different types of words in natural text, for example demonstratives, question
words and so on. The concordance proved practical in elicitation with informants, because
all the information in a particular field, plus the source of that information, was easily
accessible. For instance, when the function and occurrence of a particular deictic element
had to be analysed, examples were taken from the concordance. These examples could
then be used as a basis for further elicitation.
    Towards the end of my stay in Ayawasi, much of the elicitation as well as the
transcriptions were done monolingually. This, and conversations conducted and overheard
in the village, proved a valuable source of new data.
    The data on which this grammar is based comprises the following material:
stories and myths
   These stories include traditional tales, incorporating trickster stories, myths, fables,
children’s stories, speeches (made in Church), travel accounts, conversations, explanations,
historical narratives, and family histories. Some of this material was recorded by others, for
example Han Schoorl and Wanda Avé, and given to me to work out.written material
   When people in Ayawasi realised that I recorded stories and subsequently transcribed

                           [w]                                                    [j]  All consonantal phonemes can occur in word-initial and word-medial position. The
phonemes /p/, /w/ and /y/ cannot occur in word-final position.92.1.2.1 Allophones of the consonants
   The phonetic description of the consonantal phonemes and their main allophones is
given below.
Plosives:
/p/ → [p], [b]       bilabial plosive
                     [»pejAk] ~ [»bejAk]                 /peak/          ‘they throw away’
                     [»tapum] ~ [»tabum]                 /tapum/         ‘I lie on my stomach’
                     [»tapAm] ~ [»tabAm]                 /tapam/         ‘land’
   The bilabial plosives [p] and [b] vary freely. The reason for choosing the symbol /p/ to
represent both the voiceless allophone [p] and the voiced allophone [b] is twofold: first,
phonetically [p] is more common, even intervocalically, thus [»tapAm] ‘ground’ is more
common than [»tabAm]. Second, of the other plosives, the dental plosive is always realised9
    Phonetically, [w] and [j] occur in word-final position as allophones of /u/ and /i/ respectively (see §2.1.1).
22      Chapter 2as a voiceless stop, so that voiceless /t/ is the most obvious phonemic form. The velar
plosive [k] only varies freely with [g] intervocalically, so that voiceless /k/ is an obvious
phonemic representation. Because the bilabial plosive belongs to the same natural class as
the alveolar and velar plosives, and the latter two are voiceless, I choose the symbol /p/ to
represent the bilabial plosives [p] and [b].
/t/ → [t]         voiceless alveolar plosive
                  [tima»ra]       /timara/             ‘my ear’
                  [»tatEm]        /tatem/              ‘my hand’
                  [»pçi:t]        /poiit/10            ‘food’
                  [t] varies freely with aspirated alveolar plosive [tH] and unreleased alveolar
                  plosive [t˚] in word-final position:
         [tH]     [xçt]       ~ [xçtH]            /xot/      ‘saliva’
                  [»pçi:t]    ~ [»pçi:tH]         /poiit/    ‘food’
         [t˚]     [»pçi:t]      ~     [»pçi:t˚]        /poiit/         ‘food’
                  [»xapçt]      ~     [»xapçt˚]        /xapot/         ‘they are satisfied’/k/ → [k]         voiceless velar plosive
                  [kan]            /kan/               ‘embers’
                  [»wikan]         /wikan/             ‘tears’
                  [«tanaf´»RAk]    /tanafrak/          ‘my skull’
                  [k] and [g] vary freely intervocalically:
         [g]      [»pçkuwo] ~ [»pçguwo] /pokuo/                        ‘a feast’
                  [t´ki»jAs] ~ [t´gi»jAs]        /tkias/               ‘I tell’
                  [k] varies freely with [k˚] in word-final position:
         [k˚]     [p´»tAk] ~ [p´»tAk˚]            /ptak/      ‘they open’
                  [»manIk] ~ [»manIk˚]            /manik/     ‘oil’
   To recapitulate, only the plosive /p/ can be realised as voiced and voiceless in word-
initial position. Whereas intervocalically the plosives /p/ and /k/ can be realised
phonetically as both voiced and voiceless, the phoneme /t/ only has a voiceless realisation
intervocalically. In word-final position, the plosives show no phonetic contrast between
voiced and voiceless. Both /t/ and /k/ have an unreleased allophone in word-final position.
The only aspirated plosive attested in the data is word-final [tH].
Nasals:
/m/ → [m]         voiced bilabial nasal
                  [mEs]         /mes/               ‘blood’
                  [»amAx]       /amax/              ‘house’
                  [»taim]       /taim/              ‘I cook’10
     In this form, the plural stem of -ait ‘eat’, namely -iit, occurs. This plural stem contains a sequence of like
     vowels (see §3.3). Phonetically, this vowel is long (see §2.2.1).
                                                                                         Phonology        23       [N]      voiced velar nasal
                [«ajaNk´»re] /aya mkre/          ‘tributary’    (< aya ‘water’; kre ‘branch’)
                [ANk´»re]     /amkre/            ‘sago leaf’    ( < a ‘liana’,11 kre ‘branch’)
                [A»Nkafu]     /amkafu/           ‘merremia cf. peltata’12
                [si»Nkis]     /simkis/           k.o. needle    (< si ‘needle’ kis ‘?’)
   The forms incorporating a velar nasal all seem to be compound forms, because of the
placement of main stress (see §2.4). The velar nasal assimilates to the following velar stop
resulting in a homorganic cluster. I assume that [N] historically derives from an unmarked
subject prefix /m-/ (see §3.1 and §4.1.1) which was affixed to the second member of the
compound. A similar instance of a form with a possible remnant of an unmarked subject
prefix is [»mpair] ‘place’ in which the subject prefix and the following stop are also
homorganic. [»mpair] is possibly a spatial noun (see also §4.3.1).
   Alternatively, [N] is the result of prenasalisation. Prenasalisation of stops is common in
Papuan languages (cf. Foley 1986:61–62).13
/n/ → [n]14 voiced alveolar nasal
            [»namo]        /namo/                ‘you (S) go’

            [k´ro»fEn]     /kro»fen/             ‘their kidney’
Fricatives:
/f/ [f] voiceless labio-dental fricative, varies freely with voiceless bilabial fricative [∏]:

           [m´»tAx] ~ [m´»tAF]            /mtax/      ‘dog’11
   The meaning of /a/ is unclear, but this element occurs frequently (it was found in over ninety forms) in
   plant names.

   The sap of the stem of the angkafu tree is used against cough (Avé 1998:54). Because many plant names
   are syntactically compounds (see also §4.3.5), I conclude that this is also a compound, in which the first
   element is isomorphous to a in angkre ‘sago leaf’.
13
   Another alternative is that [N] is analysed as an epenthesised element between a vowel and a following
   voiceless velar stop /k/ in compounds, since [N] in this position is completely predictable. This would
   make its status the same as that of [´] between CC-clusters.
14
   [N] as an allophone of /n/ only occurs in loan words, for example in [sENkçr] <Du Steenkool, as in (73).

2.1.2.2 Minimal pairs showing contrasts for consonants
      Phonological contrasts for consonants are given below:
/p/      vs.   /t/        /peta/           ‘together’
                          /teta/           ‘top end of wooden house posts’
                          /put/            ‘leech’
                          /tut/            ‘corner’
                          /mapo/           ‘flood’
                          /mato/           ‘hole’
               /k/        /pron/           ‘bamboo’
                          /kron/           ‘it sounds’
                          /tpo/            ‘I hold’
                          /tko/            ‘I burn something’16
   This is possibly a compound form, judging by the placement of stress (see §2.4).

   The use of the symbol /y/, orthographically y, to represent [j] is motivated by the literate Maybrat in
   Ayawasi themselves. They used y to represent the sound [j] because in relation to their knowledge of
   Indonesian orthography, y reflects the sound system of Maybrat more accurately than j: in Indonesian
   orthography j it is used to represent [dj], which occurs frequently in the Indonesian language.

   The segments [j] and [w] can be analysed as consonantal phonemes /y/ and /w/
respectively, or as allophones of the vowel phonemes /i/ and /u/. The reasons for analysing
these segments as consonantal phonemes are as follows:20 firstly, in word-initial position,
20
      An analysis in which [j] and [w] are allophones of /i/ and /u/ is given by Brown (1991), who did his
      fieldwork in Ayamaru. He bases his argument on distinctive stress patterns. He argues that in unstressed
      positions, the non-consonatal segments /i/ and /u/ can be realised as [y] (corresponding to [j] in the present
      description) and [w] respectively. For example, /ni»o/ ‘you’ becomes /nio/ [»nyˆ], while in /»nio/ ‘You are
      tall’ /i/ remains non-consonantal, yielding [»niyo]. In Ayawasi, these forms appear as [»nuwo] ‘you’ and
      [»nijo] ‘You are tall’. Some phonemic contrasts for stress according to Brown are: [»nasçm] ‘You carry’ vs.
      [na»som] ‘your name is’; [»maru] ‘She cuts’ vs. [ma»ru] ‘lake’; [»an´] ‘they’ vs. [a»na] ‘fence’ and [»moo]
      ‘She takes’ vs. [mo»o] ‘She itches’. In Ayawasi all these forms appear as homophones [»nasçm] ‘You
      carry, your name is’; [»maru] ‘She cuts, lake’; [»ana] ‘they, fence’ and [»moo] ‘She takes, She itches’. Other
      forms where Brown notes differing main stresses are [a»max] vs. Ayawasi [»amAx] ‘house’; [re»re] vs.
      Ayawasi [»rere] ‘later’; [ta»bam] vs. Ayawasi [»tapAm] ‘earth’; [na»a] vs. Ayawasi [»na:] ‘your leg’; [i»so]
      vs. Ayawasi [»iso] ‘road, trail’. In other words, whereas Brown found stress to be phonemic, which enables
28    Chapter 2[j] and [w] are distinctive, regardless of whether they occur before a vowel or before a
consonant.21 When [i] vs. [j] and [u] vs. [w] are artificially contrasted, the forms in which a
vowel [i]/[u] instead of a semivowel [j]/[w] is realised were rejected (marked ‘*’) by
informants.
(7)       *[iaf]           vs.     [jaf]           /yaf/           ‘wound’
          *[»iimp´ra]      vs.     [»jimp´ra]      /yimpra/        ‘it is tame’
          *[»iuwan]        vs.     [»juwan]        /yuan/          ‘it is light’
          *[»uata]        vs.      [»wata]         /wata/          ‘fishtrap’
          *[»uyo]         vs.      [w´»jo]         /wyo/           ‘quickly’
   Similarly when a semivowel [j]/[w] instead of a vowel [i]/[u] is realised, the forms are
rejected:
(8)       *[j´n]22         vs.     [i:n]           /in/            ‘earthquake’
          *[j´»ra]         vs.     [»ira]          /ira/           ‘just now’
          *[j´»sç]         vs.     [»iso]          /iso/           ‘track’
          *[j´»sie]        vs.     [»isie]         /isie/          ‘sun’
          *[w´»mam] vs.            [»umam]         /umam/          ‘sweat’
   Intervocalically, when within a morpheme [i]/[u] instead of a vowel [j]/[w] is realised,
the forms are rejected, regardless of whether V1 and V2 are like vowels or not:
(9)       *[»aia]          vs.      [»aja]         /aya/           ‘water’
          *[»toio]         vs.      [»tojo]        /toyo/          ‘where’
          *[pa»iir]       vs.       [pa»ir]        /payir/         ‘rainbow’
          *[fa»iir]       vs.       [fa»jir]       /fayir/         ‘decoration’
   [j] and [w] also appear as epenthetic elements between specific sequences of vowels
(see §2.2.1).23
2.2 Phonotactics
   In this section I will discuss the various possible sequences of consonants and vowels in
monomorphemic forms. Section 2.2.1 deals with sequences of vowels and in §2.2.2
sequences of consonants are discussed.
   him to make generalisations about the realisation of the semivowels in unstressed positions, I only found
   stress to be weakly phonemic. Admittedly the forms mentioned as homophones are suspicious, but
   elaborate acoustic and perceptual experiments did not result in a verifiable difference between the
   members of each pair (see Chapter 3, footnote 3).
21
   The sequence /wC/ is very uncommon.
22
   An epenthetic vowel schwa invariably occurs between two consonants (see §2.3.2).
23
   Alternatively, word-initially and word-medially, the pairs /y/ and /i/, and the pairs /w/ and /u/ can be
   analysed as being in complementary distribution, as the distinctive minimal pairs given above are not fully
   airtight: some informants were unsure whether the forms marked ‘*’ in (7)–(9) were incorrect. The
   majority, however, did reject them, which is why I analysed /y/ and /w/ as phonemic.
                                                                           Phonology     292.2.1 Sequences of vowels
  The vowel sequences that occur in the data are given in (10) below:
(10)
           V2→       i       e      a      o     u
           V1↓
             i       x       x      x      x
            e                       x      x
            a        x       x             x     x
            o        x              x      x
            u                       x      x     x  Combinations of like vowels only occur in plural verb stems (see also §3.3):
(11)    /piit/           [pi:t]         ‘we eat’
        /niit/           [ni:t]         ‘you (P) eat’
        /poos/           [po:s]         ‘our shoulder’
        /noos/           [no:s]         ‘your (P) shoulder’
        /puut/           [pu:t]         ‘we climb’
        /nuut/           [nu:t]         ‘you (P) climb’
   In the forms in (11), the vowel must be phonetically long, while in monosyllabic stems
the vowel is optionally phonetically long. In this way, the following contrasts can be made:
(12)    /put/    ‘leech’      vs.   /puut/     ‘we climb’
        /po/     ‘thing’      vs.   /poo/      ‘our shoulder’
   Because the phonetically long vowels in (11) are interpreted phonologically as
sequences of like vowels, and not as phonologically long vowels, the forms in (12) do not
constitute minimal pairs.
   Combinations of unlike vowels in which the first vowel is low occur in word-initial
position (13), word-medial position (14), and in word-final position (15):
(13)    /ai/             [»ai]          ‘alone’
        /ae/             [»ae]          ‘yes (affirmative)’
        /au/             [»au]          ‘she, it’
        /aof/            [»açf]         ‘sago’
(14)    /xaen/           [»xaEn]        ‘it is shallow’
        /kais/           [»kais]        ‘their buttocks’
        /mauf/           [»mauf]        ‘contents’
        /maon/           [»maçn]        ‘It is sharp’
30      Chapter 2(15)        /mai/          [»mai]         ‘they hit; PROHIB; sound’
            /tae/          [»tae]         ‘I am at’
            /sau/          [»sau]         ‘one’
            /tao/          [»tao]         ‘my foot; my sibling (SS)’
    In the VV-sequences below, a phonetic glide [j] or [w] occurs between the vowels.
Because there are no minimal pairs that warrant a distinction between /VV/ and /VyV/ or
/VwV/, I will assume that this glide is non-phonemic.24 The quality of the glide can be
predicted from the quality of the first vowel in the sequence: if this is a front vowel (/i/ or
/e/), the glide is [j], and if it is a back vowel (/u/ or /o/), the glide is [w]. Examples of word-
medial sequences where [j] is inserted appear in (16), and where [w] is inserted in (18).
Corresponding word-final sequences appear in (17) and (19) respectively.
(16)        /riox/          [»rijçx]        ‘they destroy with hand’
            /wiak/          [»wijAk]        ‘canoe’
            /kream/         [k´»rejAm]      ‘they cut’
(17)        /skie/          [s´ki»je]       ‘they build’
            /fio/           [»fijo]          k.o. grass
            /sia/           [»sija]         ‘with’
            /fea/           [»feja]         ‘they swallow’
            /sreo/          [s´»rejo]       ‘it is accurate’
            /reo/           [»rejo]         ‘tight’
(18)        /puax/          [»puwAx]        ‘enemy’
(19)        /suo/           [»suwo]         ‘faeces’
            /tuo/           [»tuwo]         ‘I’
            /toa/           [»towa]         ‘I don’t know’
2.2.2 Sequences of consonants
    As stated in §2.1.2, any single consonantal phoneme can occur in word-initial position.
In word-final position any single consonantal phoneme can occur except for /p/, /y/ and
/w/. In monomorphemic forms, sequences of two consonants occur in two positions: (1) in
morpheme-initial position, and (2) in morpheme-medial position on the condition that the
first C in such a CC-cluster is a nasal. In (20) below I have indicated the morpheme-initial
CC-clusters that occur:

     An attempt was made to oppose /VV/ and /VyV/ or /VwV/, but the answers given by informants were not
     equivocal, and they were not able to give minimal pairs.

   In forms that take a person prefix, any C can follow, in other words, /tC/, /nC/, /yC/,
/mC/ and /pC/, where C is any consonantal phoneme, occur (see §3.1 and §4.1 for person
prefixes).
   It appears that Maybrat has a large number of combinatory possibilities of Cs in word-
initial position at the phonemic level. However, phonetically all the CC-sequences
indicated above are broken up by an epenthetic schwa. Similar combinatory possibilities of
consonants at the phonemic level are also reflected in Kalam, a Papuan language described
by Pawley (1966). In this language too there are no consonant clusters at the phonetic
level, as all are broken up by a transition vowel [Æ] (Foley 1986:50–51).
   Some examples of /Cr/ sequences are given in (22):
29
     This is a reduplicated form (see §3.5).
                                                                                      Phonology       33(22)       /pron/          [p´»rçn]            ‘bamboo’

           /fri/           [f´»ri]             ‘they find’
           /xrexa/         [x´»rexa]           ‘their tongue’
   People who are bilingual in Maybrat and Indonesian can pronounce [Cr]-clusters: they
are influenced by Indonesian, which also has this type of cluster, and have learned how to
pronounce it:
(23)       [prçn]          ‘bamboo’
           [trat]          ‘daylight’
           [krEk]          ‘their armpit’
           [fri]           ‘they find’
           [xrexa]         ‘their tongue’
     In /sr/ sequences [´] is invariably epenthesised:
(24)       /srot/          [s´»rçt]            ‘they are fast’
           /srar/          [s´»rAr]            ‘they dance’
           /sre/           [s´»re]             ‘they are wrong’
Examples of CC-clusters broken up by epenthetic schwa are given in §2.3.2.
  Examples of word-medial CC-clusters are:
(25)       /xampax/        [»xAmpAx]           ‘tip of sago sheet’
           /nimpon/        [»nimpçn]           ‘watermelon’
           /xampat/        [»xAmpAt]           ‘woodtrunk’
           /kram»yo/       [k´rAm»jo]          ‘Canthium sp.’30
   The only instance of a word-medial CC-sequence in which the first C is not a nasal is
/wox0rarar/ ‘They shout’. I suspect that this is a compound form, as the main stress is on the
second syllable, and not on the first. Phonetically a schwa (see §2.3.2) is optionally
inserted between the [xr] sequence, that is [wçx´»rarar]. In other words, the word-medial
cluster /xr/ behaves like a word-initial CC-sequence, suggesting that the first member of
the compound is /wo/, and the second /xrarar/.
   In multimorphemic forms, CC-sequences, though uncommon, may occur across
morpheme boundaries, as in, for instance, compound nouns (see also §4.3.5).
(26)       /apit kek/       [«apit»kEk]     k.o. banana
                  < [a»pit] ‘banana’ + [kEk] ‘red’
           /piek safe/     [«pijEk»safe]   ‘Trichospermum sp.’
                                     31
                 < [»pijEk] ‘string’ + [»safe] ‘black’
30
   Kramyo is used for poles, and as firewood (Avé 1998:11). Given the placement of stress, this form is
   possibly a compound form.
31
   Piek ‘string’ regularly occurs as a first member in compound nouns denoting plant names (cf. Avé 1998:
   B20–B21).
34      Chapter 22.3 Syllable and word structure
   In the present section I will begin by describing the structure of syllables and words
which do not include schwa, and illustrate what the basic syllable pattern in Maybrat is.
Subsequently I will incorporate the forms which include epenthetic schwa in the analysis,
showing that epenthetic schwa is syllabic. I will illustrate that the syllable structure in
Maybrat is based on the phonetic structure of a word, which incorporates schwa. The
description is based on monomorphemic forms. However, in the examples I also use forms
which take a covert person prefix. Since this person prefix is not phonologically realised,
these forms behave like monomorphemic forms from a phonological point of view.","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"
"4.8 Location
    There are a number of forms that indicate where or in what direction the action
described in the clause takes place. Some of these forms have already been discussed,
namely spatial nouns (§4.3.1), demonstratives (§4.4) and locative adverbs (§4.7.4). In this
section I will discuss the remaining forms that express location. These are, roughly
speaking, the location markers to ‘LOC’ and wo ‘LOC.GEN’, and the directionals u ‘up’ and
tis ‘behind’. While some of these forms can function as free morphemes, others are only
attested as bound forms. What all the forms expressing location have in common is that
they occur in the location periphery in clause, and that the main verb in the clause in which
they occur is normally a motion or position verb (see §4.2.3.2).4.8.1 to and wo
    The forms to and wo are related to the demonstrative prefixes te- ‘area.N’ and we-
‘location.GEN’. Recall that these prefixes are also used in the formation of question words
(see §4.5). Because to and wo have a very general function, that is, they are used to mark
forms that express ‘location’, they are glossed as LOC and LOC.GEN respectively. Below, I
will describe these location markers. The form wo is only used in complex directionals,
and the discussion of these forms is deferred until §4.8.2.
    When to functions as a location marker, it marks the following NP as a location. It can
be adequately translated as ‘to, at’. The form wo cannot function as a location marker. This
is ‘natural’, since when a location marker precedes an NP that expresses location, this is a
location that can be pinpointed. Therefore, the use of the general location marker wo here
is inadequate. Some examples follow:
(314)        ø-frok     to Kumurkek
             ø-emerge LOC Kumurkek
             ‘He arrives at Kumurkek.’
(315)        amu p-mo to         rapuoh
             1P   1P-go LOC forest
             ‘We go to the forest.’
(316)        ku     ø-kiniah m-som to           tauf
             child ø-small 3U-play LOC forest
             ‘The children play in the forest.’6666
     To tauf is also used to indicate ‘outside’; it need not necessarily be in the forest.
                                                                           Word classes      119   In this position, to is not obligatory. In example (317) a form with and one without to is
given. The semantic difference between these two forms is minimal: in the a-form, the fact
that Sorong refers to a location is specified by to, although in the b-form, it is obvious that
Sorong refers to a location from the semantic content of the object. There is, however a
syntactic difference between these two forms: in (317b) Sorong functions as a regular
nominal object, that is it can be extracted through relativisation. This is not the case in
(317a). This difference is further discussed in §6.8.6.
(317) a.      y-amo to Sorong
              3M-go LOC Sorong
              ‘He goes to Sorong.’
        b.    y-amo Sorong
              3M-go Sorong
              ‘He goes to Sorong.’4.8.2 Directionals
   The forms u ‘up’ and tis ‘behind’ are classified as directionals. Like ete, u, but not tis,
can function as a location adverb:
(318)        m-hu u
             3U-stay up
             ‘They are above.’
  The form u can also modify the adverb akah ‘above’. Here, u creates emphasis. A
contrast is given in example (319).
(319) a.      ana m-amo akah u faut
              3P 3U-go above up hilltop
              ‘They go to the very top of the hill.’
        b.    ana m-amo akah faut
              3P 3U-go above hilltop
              ‘They go to the top of the hill.’
    The forms tis and totis can function as temporal adverbials, as described in §6.8.1.
    The forms u and tis can be prefixed with the location marker to to form the
morphologically complex directionals to-u ‘direction where the sun rises’; and to-tis
‘behind’. The locative adverb ete can also be prefixed with to to form to-te ‘direction
where the sun sets’. Here, the optional phoneme schwa (see §2.1.1.1) never occurs.
    In each of these complex directionals, the stress is on the first syllable, for example
»to|te, »to|u and »to|tis (where ‘|’ marks a syllable boundary, see Chapter 2). Conversely, in
the type of forms discussed in the previous section, for instance, to »ta|uf ‘to the forest’, and
to »ra|puoh ‘to the forest’, the stress is not on to but on the first syllable of the following
noun. This suggests that in the latter forms to functions like a preposition, whereas in to-te,
to-u and to-tis, to functions as a morpheme in a word.
    The complex directionals to-u, to-te and to-tis can function as location adverbials in a
clause. Some examples follow:
120       Chapter 4(320)         t-amo to-u
              1S-go LOC-up
              ‘I go in the direction where the sun rises.’
(321)         y-pat    to-te
              3M-from LOC-below
              ‘He comes from the direction where the sun sets.’
(322)         fai    m-hu to-tis
              woman 3U-stay LOC-behind
              ‘The woman stays behind there.’
  The form to-au ‘LOC-U.DIST’, but not to-f-o and to-n-o, can also function as a location
adverbial in a clause:
(323)         ana m-amo to-au
              3P 3U-go LOC-U.DIST
              ‘They go there.’
  With the exception of to-au, each of these complex directionals can be followed by an
NP:
(324)         ana m-amo to-te            Frakron
              3P 3U-go LOC-below Frakron
              ‘They go in the direction where the sun sets, to Frakron.’
(325)         ait y-hu         to-u     Meah
              3M 3M-stay LOC-up Meah
              ‘He lives in the direction where the sun rises, in Meah.’
(326)         au ø-hren to-tis         amah
              3U ø-sit LOC-behind house
              ‘She sits behind the house.’
  The forms to-te and to-u express the direction of the action. Compare, for instance, the
two forms below:
(327) a.       t-amo to-te          Jakarta
               1S-go LOC-below Jakarta
               ‘I go in the direction where the sun sets, to Jakarta.’
         b.    t-amo to-u      Jayapura
               1S-go LOC-up Jayapura
               ‘I go to Jayapura.’
   The combination of ‘wo+directional’ that functions as an adverbial, analogous to (320)–
(322), or ‘wo+directional’ followed by a noun, analogous to (324)–(326), is not possible.
   The complex directionals can be followed by a demonstrative form to-f-o
‘LOC-very.near-U’ or to-n-o ‘LOC-far-U’.67 The function of this demonstrative form is to
further specify the distance at which the action described in the clause takes place. Some
examples follow:67
     Examples of a complex directional followed by to-t-o ‘LOC-near-U’ are unattested in the data.

         (into the rope around their waist)’.
(329)    ku ø-kiniah m-som to-u             to-n-o
         child ø-small 3U-play LOC-up LOC-far-U
         ‘The small child plays up there (specific place) (in the direction
         where the sun rises).’

         LOC-far-U   3U-give.birth Baru 3U-large
         ‘They go and they multiply and they move down (in the direction
         where the sun sets) for a long time and they multiply until the Baru
         family is big.’
(331)    ana m-amo to-tis           to-f-o
         3P 3U-go LOC-behind LOC-very.near-U
         ‘They go behind there, nearby.’
   In the discussion on question words in §4.5, I illustrated that the difference between the
interrogative prefixes to and wo is one of specificity: whereas to refers to a specific
location, wo refers to a general location, that is a location that cannot be pinpointed. This
same difference is found in forms where a complex directional prefixed with wo is
followed by a demonstrative form.
(332)    ku     ø-kiniah m-som to-te            to-f-o
         child ø-small 3U-play LOC-below LOC-very.near-U
         ‘The small child plays below here (specific place).’

         child ø-small 3U-play LOC.GEN-below LOC.GEN-very.near-U
         ‘The small child plays at a place below here (general place).’
   Similar forms with wo are:
(334)    au m-amo wo-u        wo-f-o
         3U 3U-go LOC.GEN-up LOC.GEN-very.near-U
         ‘She walks up here.’
(335)    ku     ro sme y-som wo-t-e           wo-n-o
         child REL male 3M-play LOC.GEN-below LOC.GEN-far-U
         ‘The boy plays down there.’
  The prefixes to and wo cannot be used in combination with each other in a locative
expression, that is *to-te wo-n-o.","[136, 137, 138, 139]"

   A tally of the occurrence of fe and m-fe in the texts yielded the following numbers:

172      Chapter 6   In most cases where a clause is modified by an adverbial and negated, the adverbial
precedes the negator, like ati in example (182), fi-t-o in (183), and fawen in (183) and
(184). In all these examples, the negator is interpreted as saying something about the
adverbial, that is (182) implies ‘I am a man, but not a “real” (ati) man’. Likewise, (184)
implies ‘We do this thing, but not for a long time’.
(182)        tuo rae       ati fe
             1S person real NEG
             ‘I am not a real person.’
(183)        y-no    fi-t-o        fe
             3M-do like-near-U NEG
             ‘He doesn’t do it like this.’
(184)        fnia     anu p-no po      re-t-o                  fawen      fe
             woman 1P 1P-do thing location.SPEC-near-U long.time NEG
             ‘(We) women, we haven’t done these things (=traditional education)
             for a long time.’
   The focus adverb iye ‘too’ can precede and follow the negator in a clause. Varying the
position of fe and iye results in a difference in scope of these adverbs. Consider, for
instance, the two forms in example (185) (both elicited forms). In (185a) the scope of the
negator is the clause y-amo Kumurkek, and the scope of the adverbial iye is the entire
(negative) clause Simon y-amo Kumurkek fe. Conversely, in (185b), the scope of the
negator is Kumurkek iye. The implication of (185b) is that ‘Simon’ goes to many places,
but not to Kumurkek, whereas in (185a) the implication is that in addition to others who do
not go to Kumurkek, Simon doesn’t go to Kumurkek either.
(185) a.      Simon y-amo Kumurkek fe         iye
              Simon 3M-go Kumurkek NEG also
              ‘He does not go to Kumurkek either.’
        b.    Simon y-amo Kumurkek iye fe
              Simon 3M-go Kumurkek also NEG
              ‘He does not also go to Kumurkek.’
  The order iye fe, as in example (185b), is highly marked; the most frequent order for the
negator fe and the adverbial iye is that in (185a). This is surprising, since usually the
negator occurs clause-finally. This suggests that the combination fe iye is idiomatic. Some
more examples are:
(186)        m-amo ninan        fe    iye
             3U-go randomly NEG also
             ‘They also do not go randomly.’
(187)        n-he fe     iye
             2-see NEG also
             ‘You also don’t see.’
                                                                                         The clause       173   The negator fe can also be followed by the aspect adverbial fares ‘still’ to form the
idiomatic expression fe fares ‘not yet’.31 Some examples follow:
(188)     n-ao          Lys m-ama Ayawasi fe           fares
          2-sibling.SS Lys 3U-come Ayawasi NEG still
          ‘Your (relative/sister) has not come to Ayawasi yet.’
(189)     Nella m-amo fe        fares
          Nella 3U-go NEG still
          ‘Nella has not gone yet.’
(190)     m-e       pitis   fe   fares
          3U-give money NEG still
          ‘She has not given money yet.’
   When there are other adverbials in the clause, that is kaket in (191), fe fares normally
follows those adverbs:
(191)     ø-kiyam m-arak         kaket fe      fares
          ø-ill     3U-empty well NEG still
          ‘My illness is not yet finished well.’ (lit. ‘I am ill, it is not yet finished well.’)
    In sentence-initial position, the predicative m-fe can be followed by the manner adverb
fi-t-o to form the expression m-fe fi-t-o. This expression stipulates that there is a choice: if
the clause preceding m-fe fi-t-o does not apply, then the following clause applies. M-fe
fi-t-o can be adequately translated as ‘or alternatively’. Some examples follow:
(192)     y-fais m-ae pron, m-fe             fi-t-o       ara hri32
          3M-fill 3U-at bamboo 3U-NEG like-near-U tree bark
          ‘He puts it into a bamboo, or alternatively, into a treebark.’
(193)     ø-frok     ari s-au,     m-fe       fi-t-o       ari eok
          ø-emerge day one-3U 3U-NEG like-near-U day two
          ‘He arrives after one day, or alternatively, after two days.’
(194)     mtah m-afit, m-fe          fi-t-o         rae      y-ame
          dog 3U-bite 3U-NEG like-near-U person 3M-stab
          ‘A dog bites (the prey), or alternatively, a man stabs (it).’
   The forms fe and m-fe can also function as disjunctive coordinators. They are discussed
in §9.1.3. Disjunctive coordination is also used in alternative questions, which are
discussed in §7.1.","[189, 190, 191]"

    I have not verified the relativised variety, but I suspect the form below is acceptable, although the
    translation is very tortured.

196         Chapter 88.3 Complements
   Some constructions are formally identical to coordinating constructions on the surface,
but syntactically they are constructions of the type ‘verb+complement’. In these
constructions, the ‘verb’ must be one of the verbs defined in §4.2.3.4, to recapitulate, a
‘perception verb’ or a ‘mental activity verb’, the causative verb -no ‘do’ or the verb -awe
‘say’. The clause following the verb is a complement, that is it functions as the syntactic
object of the verb. Some examples appear below: in the a-varieties, the object is formally a
clause which functions as an object complement, while in the b-varieties the object of that
verb is formally a noun. The square brackets mark the object:
(38) a.      t-ari     [[rae   m-mai]]
             1S-hear person 3U-sound
             ‘I hear a man making a sound.’
       b.    t-ari      [[mai]]
             1S-hear sound
             ‘I hear a sound.’
(39) a.      t-he     [[fnia  m-ama]]
             1S-see woman 3U-come
             ‘I see a woman coming.’
       b.    t-he      [[fnia]]
             1S-see woman
             ‘I see a woman.’
(40) a.      t-no [[y-aut     ara]]
             1S-do 3M-climb tree
             ‘I make him climb into the tree.’
       b.    t-no [[po]]
             1S-do thing
             ‘I do something.’
   In (41) and (42) below, the object in (42) is formally a relative clause (see §5.3).
(41)         y-awe [[y-amo ora]]
             3M-say 3M-go garden
             ‘He says that he goes to the garden.’
(42)         y-awe [[po ro         m-of]]
             3M-say thing REL 3U-good
             ‘He says good things.’
   In the discussion on coordinating sequences I showed that differing intonation contours
or the insertion of mati do not effect a significant semantic change. In verb sequences
involving complement-taking verbs, a clause-final intonation or the presence of mati after
the first verb can be distinctive: the second verb can only be interpreted as a main verb. In
the a-varieties of (43)–(46) below, each ‘perception’ or ‘mental activity’ verb is dominated
by a clausal intonation contour. In the corresponding b-varieties, the whole utterance is
dominated by one clausal intonation contour. The result is a significant difference in
meaning.

          1S-know 1S-write letter
          ‘I can write a letter (as in ‘I know how to write a letter’).’
  The same difference applies when an overt coordinator is inserted between the verbs.
Examples (47a) and (48a) below are both perfectly acceptable, but there is a marked
semantic difference between the utterances with and without mati.
(47) a.   t-sam      mati      t-aut       ara
          1S-scared and.then 1S-climb tree

          child 3M ø-enjoy 3M-eat sago
          ‘The child enjoys eating sago.’
198         Chapter 8(49) a.      ø-hawe mati          y-aut       ara
             ø-refuse and.then 3M-climb tree
             ‘I refuse and then he climbs into the tree.’

             ø-refuse 3M-climb tree
             ‘I don’t like him climbing into the tree.’
   Constructions involving a causative verb -no, for example (40a), do not allow a clausal
break or the insertion of mati between the verbs.
   If the verb -awe ‘say’ in a sequence is followed by a pause, then the utterance is
interpreted as direct speech. Note that the pitch over the last syllable of -awe normally
rises. If one intonation contour dominates the entire expression, it is interpreted as indirect
speech or as a pseudo-quotative construction. An example:
(50) a.      y-awé / t-amo orà
             3M-say      1S-go garden
             ‘Hei says, “Ii will go to the garden.”’
       b.    y-awe t-amo orà
             3M-say 1S-go garden
             ‘Hei said that Ij went to the garden.’
   Some more contrasts are given in examples (51) and (52):
(51) a.      t-awé / t-amo ora            re       t-o      tuò
             1S-say      1S-go garden so.that 1S-take palm.wine
             ‘I said, “I will go to the garden to take palm wine.”’
       b.    t-awe t-amo ora            re       t-o      tuò
             1S-say 1S-go garden so.that 1S-take palm.wine
             ‘I said that I went to the garden to take palm wine.’
(52) a.      y-awé / n-ame fanè
             3M-say     3M-stab pig
             ‘He says, “You stab a pig.”’
       b.    y-awe n-ame fanè
             3M-say 3M-stab pig
             ‘He said that you stabbed a pig.’
   When complement-taking constructions are placed in the interrogative mood, they can
never be interpreted as ambiguous constructions, unlike coordinating constructions.
Examples (53)–(56) are all dominated by a single intonation contour, so in terms of
intonation they are formally similar to the b-varieties of (43)–(46).
(53)         n-ari rae      m-mai      mimo à /
             2-hear person 3U-sound very INT
             ‘Do you hear the people making a lot of noise?’
(54)         ø-hawe n-aut pesawat terbang à              /
             ø-refuse 2-climb machine fly           INT
             ‘Do you refuse to climb into an aeroplane?’
                                                                      Sequences of verbs   199(55)        ø-skoh n-ait aof à         /
            ø-enjoy 2-eat sago INT
            ‘Do you enjoy eating sago?’
(56)        n-no y-ait    à     /
            2-do 3M-eat INT
            ‘Do you make him eat?’
   In these examples, the scope of the interrogator is the whole utterance. For instance,
(53) can never mean *‘You hear people, but do they make a lot of noise?’. Similarly, the
scope of the interrogator in (54) can only be the entire utterance: it cannot mean *‘You
refuse, but do you climb into the aeroplane?’ The same applies to (55), which is never
interpreted as *‘You enjoy yourself, but do you eat sago?’. Likewise, (56) cannot mean
*‘You do, but does he eat?’ Thus, unlike in coordinating constructions where the scope of
the interrogator can be either over the entire utterance or over the final conjunct (hence the
ambiguity), this is not the case in constructions involving cognitive verbs.
   This difference in meaning is confirmed when the forms are negated, as illustrated
below. In (57a) the scope of the negator is over the last clause, that is y-ait aof. An
interpretation which also includes the first conjunct is impossible. Conversely, in (57b) a
possible scope of the negator is over the entire sentence, as indicated in the translation.
(57) a.     ku    ait ø-skoh mati          y-ait   aof fe
            child 3M ø-enjoy and.then 3M-eat sago NEG
            ‘The child enjoys himself and then he does not eat sago.’
       b.   ku    ait ø-skoh y-ait        aof fe
            child 3M ø-enjoy 3M-eat sago NEG
            ‘The child does not enjoy eating sago.’
   The difference between direct and indirect speech can also be illustrated in the
interrogative mood. In direct speech, the scope of the interrogative a is always the direct
quotation. For instance, (59a) is normally interpreted as though the scope of the
interrogator is the direct quotation itself, that is *‘Does the child say, “You go to the
garden?”’. If the first verb in a direct-speech construction is to be interrogated, forms like
(59b) are available.
(58)        suster m-awe Pastor y-e              am oh          à      /
            sister 3U-say Father 3M-give letter already INT
            ‘The sister says, “Has the Father already given the letter?”’
(59) a.     ku     m-awe n-amo ora           à /
            child 3U-say 2-go       garden INT
            ‘The child says, “Do you go to the garden?”’
       b.   ku     m-awe po        à /
            child 3U-say thing INT
            ‘Does the child ask anything?’
   When an instance of indirect speech is placed in the interrogative mood, the scope of
the interrogative is always over the entire utterance, as shown in examples (60) and (61).
For instance, (60) is never interpreted as *‘He speaks, but does he climb into the coconut
tree?’. In other words, the scope of the interrogative marker is the entire construction, and
not just the last verb. The fact that in these constructions the last verb alone can never be
200         Chapter 8affected by an interrogator makes them different not only from their direct speech
counterparts, but also from coordinating sequences. This behaviour under interrogation is
similar to that of constructions involving cognitive verbs.
(60)         y-awe y-aut         son      à     /
             3M-say 3M-climb coconut INT
             ‘Did he say that he will climb into a coconut tree?’
(61)         n-awe ø-skoh Yosef à          /
             2-say ø-enjoy Yosef INT
             ‘Did you say that you like Yosef?’
    In §8.1, I showed that it is not possible to extract an object out of a coordinating
construction. Complement-like constructions do allow extraction of the object, as
illustrated below. In semantic terms, ara in (62b) can be understood as the ‘topic’ of the
RC t-sam t-aut, resulting in an acceptable utterance. In syntactic terms, this seems to
confirm that Ross’ CSC is valid for Maybrat, since the constructions presented in this
section are non-coordinating on intonational and syntactic grounds. In the examples below,
the b-varieties include an extracted object:
(62) a.      t-sam      t-aut       ara
             1S-scared 1S-climb tree
             ‘I’m afraid to climb into the tree (=I don’t dare).’
       b.    ara ro t-sam           t-aut    Ø m-ria mimo
             tree REL 1S-scared 1S-climb         3U-tall very
             ‘The tree that I’m scared to climb into is very tall.’
(63) a.      ku     ait ø-skoh y-ait         aof
             child 3M ø-enjoy 3M-eat sago
             ‘The child enjoys eating sago.’
       b.    aof ro ku          ait ø-skoh y-ait         Ø m-kek
             sago REL child 3M ø-enjoy 3M-eat                3U-red
             ‘The sago that the child enjoys eating is red.’
(64) a.      rae     m-ari      pi     y-api y-nit        po-mna
             person 3U-hear man 3M-big 3M-tell NOM-tell.tale
             ‘The people listen to the old man telling a tale.’
       b.    po-mna        ro    rae     m-ari pi      y-api y-nit Ø   m-of
             NOM-tell.tale REL   person 3U-hear man 3M-big 3M-tell     3U-good
             ‘The tale that people hear the old man tell is nice.’
(65) a.      t-no y-aut       ara
             1S-do 3M-climb tree
             ‘I make him climb into the tree.’
       b.    ara ro t-no y-aut             m-ria
             tree REL 1S-do 3M-climb 3U-tall
             ‘The tree that I make him climb into is tall.’
   Likewise, the object in constructions involving indirect speech can be extracted:
                                                                   Sequences of verbs     201(66) a.     t-awe y-amo amah

            ‘I said that he went home.’
       b.   amah ro t-awe y-amo Ø m-ae Pori
            house REL 1S-say 3M-go             3M-at Pori
            ‘The house that I said he went to is at Pori.’
(67) a.     Pak     guru y-awe y-o              pron
            mister teacher 3M-say 3M-take bamboo
            ‘The teacher wanted to take hold of the bamboo.’
       b.   pron    ro Pak        guru y-awe y-o           Ø m-tie
            bamboo REL mister teacher 3M-say 3M-take            3U-break
            ‘The bamboo that the teacher wanted to take hold of broke.’
   In this section I have demonstrated that constructions involving complements differ
from coordinating sequences of verbs in four ways. First, their intonation patterns are
different: in complement-constructions the entire utterance must be dominated by a single
intonation contour. Secondly, insertion of the overt coordinator mati either significantly
changes the meaning of the sequence, or renders it ungrammatical. This is not the case for
coordinating sequences of verbs. Thirdly, in the interrogative mood, the scope of the
interrogative marker a is always over the entire utterance. Lastly, these constructions do
allow extraction of an object through relativisation, while coordinating constructions do
not.
   In the following two subsections, I will discuss some variations on constructions
involving -awe ‘say’.","[213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219]"
