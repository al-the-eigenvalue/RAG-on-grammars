        Each drill has a specific objective of achieving a particular linguistic
  activity. Repetition drill enables the learners to listen to model utterances
  of the teacher/native speaker and then repeat the same so that proper practice
  of correct pronunciation, Sandhi and intonation are taken care of. The
  repetition drill also gives the learner a clear picture, at a glance, of the structural
  bits introduced in that lesson. Build up drill provides the learners with
  ample opportunities to practise the normal word order of the sentence and
  helps them memorise the sentence through a' systematic building up of the
  same by a progressive addition of words in the given order.                 Expansion
  drill enables the learners to be familiar with the placement of additional words
  in a given sentence frame and thus form a bigger sentence. Substitution drill
  deals with the selectional restriction among different categories of words in a
  sentence and among different manifestations of a single word and also gives
  practice of vocabulary items. Restatement drill is meant to enable the learners
. to practise the formation and use of different varieties of sentence patterns
  while transformation drill, in addition to the above purpose, also takes care
  of the inter-relationship between sentences. Response drill gives practice to
  put questions and give answers and for making relevant statements in appro-
  priate contexts. While Reinterpretation drill gives practice for the expression
  of the meaning of a given sentence pattern in more than one way, Completion
  drill prepares the learners for the ready mastery of structural elements that
  form meaningful sentences. If a teacher administers the above drills in a
  class room, he can decide on the basis of the situation whether it should be
  chorus, chain or individual. In short, drills enable the learners to train them-
  selves in the use of different types of meaningful utterances that make up the
 language.",[15]
"      While drills give practice to the learners for mastering the linguistic rules
 by automation, exercises are meant to find out whether the learners have
 imbibed the rules which they practised inductively. So, it is necessary that
 exercises are attempted only after administering drills. Exercises can be work-
 ed out by the learners both orally and in writing. The exercises are of different
 types, testing the learning of various elements of grammatical features from
 sandhi to formation of sentences that make up a conversation. Types of exer-
 cises included in this book can be summarised as below:

                                      XV11     As in the case of drills, exercises also have specific objectives
For example, exercises 1 to 4 test the operation of internal and external sandhi
and formation of compounds and sentence segments. Exercises 5 to 7 relate
to the mastery of selectional restrictions among the parts of a sentence and
different types of derivation and inflection in addition to testing the use of
vocabulary items. -From exercises 8 to 18, the emphasis is on the testing of
the ability to form various sentence patterns, their manipulations, inter-rela-
tionships and interpretations. Exercises 19 to 22 test the mastery of putting
questions and giving answers and providing appropriate responses to given
stimuli. Exercises 23, 24 and 25, test the comprehension and use of vocabulary
items learned. The rest of the exercise types test comprehension in general
and use of linguistic patterns in appropriate situations in particular.
     The vocabulary section includes the words that occur in the conversation
for the first time. They are entered in the order of their occurrence in the
conversation. The meaning of the vocabulary item is given in English and is
most often restricted to the context in which it occurs in the lesson. In the
case of certain verbs that occur in their past tense forms, the verb stems are
also given in brackets while listing the vocaulary items. The index provided
at the end of this book lists, in the alphabetical order, all the words, which
appear in the lessons. There are a total of 1,869 words in this index. They
are also identified for their first occurrence in a unit and a lesson. Tn most
of the cases the majority of the words in a lesson, more or less, belongs to the
same semantic field, thus facilitating ready recall by the learners. The users
of this book may also refer to Recall Vocabulary in Malaya/am—Semantically
Classified (Central Institute of Indian Languages, mimeographed) and Hindi-
Malayalam Common Vocabulary (197'3, Central Institute of Indian Languages),
as additional sources for learning Malayalam vocabulary.
     The Notes give information pertaining to grammatical as well as cultural
features. Grammatical notes are given as explanations from the point of
view- of function. Each of the structural bits newly introduced in the lesson
finds a note on it with illustrative examples. When felt necessary, cross
references are made with respect to the preceding notes in the same lesson
or in the previous lessons. While explaining a grammatical point, use of
technical terms is kept to the minimum.
This Book as a Generalised Course
     Though this book is the prescribed text for the Basic Course phase of
learning Malayalam in the Southern Regional Language Centre, it could be
                                      XV111easily used for any generalised second language programme in Malayalam
both by adult learners and their teachers. The teachers would do well to
expose their students to additional materials, prepared closely in conjunction
with the structures employed in a particular lesson. These materials may
be used for the development of all the four language skills: listening, speaking,
reading and writing.","[15, 16, 17, 18]"

      The Central Institute of Indian Languages was set up on the 17th July,
 1969 with a view to assisting and co-ordinating the development of Indian
 languages. The Institute was charged with the responsibility of serving as
• a nucleus to bring together all the research and literary out-put from the various
 linguistic streams to a common head and narrowing the gap between basic
 research and developmental research in the fields of languages and linguistics
 inlndia.
     The Institute and its five Regional Language Centres are thus engaged
in research and teaching, which lsad to the publication of a wide-ranging
variety of materials. Preparation of materials designed for teaching/learning at
different levels and suited to specific needs is one of the major areas of interest
of the Institute. Basic research relating to the acquisition of language and
study of language in its manifold psycho-social relations constitute another
broad range of its interest. The publications will include materials produced
by the members of the staff of the Central Institute of Indian Languages and
its Regional Language Centres and associated scholars from Universities and
Institutions, both Indian and foreign.
      The Central Institute of Indian languages has initiated a Basic Course
Series in major Indian languages to provide suitable and comprehensive material
for learning and teaching the language concerned for Indians. In a language
teaching situation, the teacher is expected to combine the roles of a psycho-
linguist, socio-linguist, linguist, language pedagogue, a creator of materials,
a literary critic and a testing and evaluation expert. Most of his competences
are naturally reflected in the materials, which simultaneously are graded from
simple to complex, known to the unknown and contrived to the natural. This
is a very difficult task. After research and experimentation we have come
out with more questions than answers at each stage of the material. For
example, how basic is basic ? What is grading ? In what way can linguistic
and cultural matter be graded ? Is question, with which most learning
begins, simpler than statement ? How does one move from a purely language
based competence to creating litrerary sensibilities ? How does one build
 into the material conceptual prose ? How are lessons to be presented ?
                                     VIShould the translated discourse structure be made to look similar to the origi-
nal discourse structure ? Questions such as these have been answered diffe-
rently by different teachers and researchers.    This search is a continuing
phenomenon^ Therefore, these materials represent our unfinished education
in this area.ii. An Intensive Course in Malayalam
     The format for the basic course is the result of a consensus arrived at by
the lecturers and principals of the five Regional Language Centres of the Insti-
tute engaged in thelteaching of major Indian languages. This is the product
of almost eight years of teaching and research. This format is flexible and
has left much scope for individual authors to innovate. If these courses
help the desirous to learn and stimulate those interested in applied linguistics,
with special reference to the teaching of Indian languages as second/foreign
languages, then the Institute would feel rewarded.
    I congratulate the teachers, the trainees, the supervisors and the press
and publication people who have brought out the publication in a creditable
manner.","[4, 5, 6]"

11.46.1. By adding different words or suffixes to the verbal participle, different
         shades of meaning are obtained. Three such usages are introduced,
         in the lesson. All the three are some type of auxiliary verbs.
11.46.2. By adding the word <o»s after the verbal participle, the sentence
         becomes negative indicating a prohibitory order or an inability
         statement. The sentence can be with or without datiy case.

"Learning a Second. Language
     Acquisition of one's mother tongue is a natural phenomenon for a human
being. When a child acquires his mother tongue, the acquisition is a slow and
gradual process, and it happens quite automatically. The child is not aware
that the process is taking place. He does not at all feel any burden or un-
easiness. But this is, not the case when an adult has to learn a second/foreign
language within a specified duration of time. The problem becomes more
acute when the learning has to take place in a situation where there is not
much of an environment of the concerned language. In such a context the
learner becomes conscious at every step that he is acquiring something new
and finds himself in a difficult plight. It is because of this that many people
are tempted to make the statement that'a second/foreign language cannot be
learned within the four walls of a class room, and that it has to be acquired in
the natural environment.
       Exposure to the language environment, no doubt, is the most ideal situa-
 tion for the acquisition of a language, but equally important are proper motiva-
 tion on the part of learners and carefully prepared instructional materials.
 It is in this direction an attempt is made in this book to provide the adult
 second language learners of Malayalam with, what could be termed, syste-
 matically organised learning materials. The three principles, namely
 selection, gradation and presentation, which a materials producer has to bear
 in mind, while preparing a text book, are taken note of and applied with
 meticulous care in the preparation of this book. The teachable items are
 presented on the basis of sound pedagogic principles, namely, a progression
, of items from simple to complex and from known to unknown, and the rele-
 vance of the given linguistic situation. Thus, the learners would find themselves
 being led to the language in a graded manner. This book would also help
 the second language teachers of Malayalam in their efforts to transfer Mala-
 yalam language habits to adult second language learners.
Objectives
    This Intensive Course is meant primarily for the teacher trainees of Sou-
thern Regional Language Centre of the Central Institute of Indian Languages,
                                    (xi)
                                        xu
 who do not know the language earlier. This is the prescribed text for the Basic
 course of the three phase ten-month course of 1100 hours of instruction. The
 other two phases are Intermediate and Advanced Courses. The Basic course
 extends over a period of 14 weeks with 450 instructional hours. At the end
 of this course the learners are able to achieve the following objectives:
     1. To perceive and reproduce the sounds and their meaningful sequences,
         which means identification of the sounds in their meaningful sequence,
         discrimination of the sounds in their meaningful sequence, and oral
         reproduction of the sounds in their meaningful sequence.
     2. To form orally sentences from given patterns and lexical items.
     3. To converse with the teacher and with fellow trainees on specified
         topics under controlled situations.
     4. To narrate specified events and topics orally.
      5. To read simple and graded passages with comprehension, which in-
           cludes the recognition of the letters of the alphabet in isolation and
           in sequence, and the comprehension of passages containing simple
           sentences.
      6. To write simple sentences and guided compositions on specified topics,
           which means the writing of the letters of the alphabet in the initial
           stage followed by words, and sentences and the writing of guided
           compositions on the basis of the cues provided.
      Of the above objectives, this Intensive Course is meant mainly to achieve
 objectives from 2 to 4. To realise the first objective, the learner has to rely
 on separate phonetic drills tailored to meet the requirements of second language
 learners. Such drills are available in Malayalam Phonetic Reader (1972,
 published by Central Institute of Indian Languages) which is a companion
 volume to this bopk in learning/teaching Malayalam sounds. Similarly,
 to achieve a part of the objectives 5 and 6, namely, learning/teaching Mala-
 yalam script, the learner/teacher may make use of the C.I.I.L.—K.V.S. Mother
Tongue Series—APNI BOLI Malayalam level I set which consists of a
Script Book, a Copy Book, A Text Book and a Teacher's Manual. Though
the above books are prepared for children learning Malayalam as a mother
tongue in Central Schools in India, they could be effectively used by adult
second language learners als6 because the Malayalam letters are presented.
         Script Book and Copy Book on the basis of similarity of shape of these
letters and the handmovements in writing them. The learners would do well
                                      xm
to learn the Malayalam script hefore they commence using this book or
learn it simultaneously while using this book. In the Regional Language
Centres of the Central Institute of Indian Languages, script is taught simul-
taneously with the spoken language from the very beginning and it is found
that the learners are able to read and write the letters in isolation and in
sequence within 15 to 20 hours of script teaching.   .
     Since many Indian learners of Malayalam are familiar with the Deva-
nagari script, first few lessons in this book are provided with transcription
in Parivardhita Deranaguri using extra symbols to represent the different
Malayalam sounds so that they can read from the first day of their
learning, the sentences they orally practice. The help of a teacher or a native
speaker may be sought to realize the exact sound value of the symbols used
to indicate Malayalam sounds. As regards Malayalam, the script used
is the conventional one and not the revised script. The modifications
made in the conventional script to derive the revised script are indicated while
presenting the Alphabet after this introduction.
Structure of the Book
     This Intensive Course consists of 25 units which contain a total of 75
lessons. Each unit, except the last one, revolves around a bundle of related
grammatical features which form a major structural chunk of the language.
Each lesson, in its turn, deals with one or more sets of teachable items which
are the structural bits that make up the whole, called language. This book
is, thus, based on a structural syllabus in which the structural bits form the
basis for gradation. Both morphological and syntactical features are taken
care of by the term structural bits. The number of lessons may vary from
unit to unit depending upon the structural bits that are focussed in the lessons.
Once a set of related grammatical features are presented through some
lessons, a review lesson is also added, either as the last lesson of a single unit
or at the end of two or more units. A review lesson introduces no new tea-
chable items, but only reinforces the items thus far included in the lessons
reviewed. The 25th unit of this book contains only review lessons with free '
style conversations.
Structure of a Lesson
     A lesson in this book is made up of a conversation, drills, exercises, voca-
bulary and notes in that order. The Conversation introduces the relevant
structural bits using a context of meaningful interaction. While controlling
                                          XIVthe linguistic structures, an effort has been made to present as natural a situa-
tion as possible. There are a few conversations that centre around the formal
class room situations in learning/teaching a second language, while the rest
present conversations simulating real life situations, such as conversation
between mother and child, father and child, husband and wife, brother and
sister, between friends, .between colleagues, a journalist and a political leader
and a leader and a common man, etc. The language variety used for conversa-
tions and other purposes is the standard colloquial as spoken by educated
 Malayalis in Trivandrum district, Kerala. The English translation given for
the sentences of the conversations has no one to one correspondence structu-
 rally or stylistically but is intended only to convey the general meaning.
     Our strategy, while stressing language learning through practice of simulat-
ing real life situations, also emphasises that learners should be given ample
opportunties to express their own ideas and opinions and chart out things for
themselves by conversing with the fellow learners. This prepares the fore-
ground for the practice of real life situations in the world outside the class
room. Because of the above reason, there are also characters and situations
in this boqk which are not typical of Malayali environment and Kerala con-
texts, but are essentially relevant to the use of Malayalam language by the
adult second language learners.
     Drills are provided for the oral practice of the teachable items introduced
in the conversation. These enable the learners to internalise inductively the
rules governing the structural bits in relation to the language. The practice
of the same results in an automatism of the linguistic pattern introduced, and
the learners are led to the production of meaningful utterances using the struc-
tures focussed in each lesson.
    Drills in this book include the following types:
         1. Repetition drill                                  - -

"Method Suggested
     While pattern practice through different types of drills goes well in a
structural method, to get best results, the teachers should, depending upon the
background and capacity of the learners, adopt an eclectic approach that
integrates the various techniques found in different methods.
     Development of reading skill includes both loud reading and reading for
comprehension. In a second language programme loud reading helps acquiring
correct reading pronunciation which in turn helps the mastery of morpho-
phonemic complexities generally reflected through changes in letters. Good
reading pronunciation will also lead to development of speaking skill as far
as the above aspect is concerned. Recitation of poems is another relevant
activity in this regard.
     For the development of reading comprehension the passages should be
prepared/selected and edited in such a way that they are both interesting and
informative. Such passages should not contain, or should contain only partly,
the contents which are already known to learners. The exercises that follow
the passages may consist of both objective and open ended types of questions.
Regular and balanced testing of all the elements with respect to the four
language skills is a must in any language programme. For that the teacher
should be well acquainted with various types of tests. This book also con-
tains, as an appendix, a model objective test paper on Malayalam structure.
The test paper consists of 100 bits and should be completed in one hour.
     As for developing the writing skill, the teacher may consider preparing
various types of materials such as those for script teaching and composition
writing. It is advisable for the teacher to practise giving dictation from the
very beginning, starting with words, phrases, sentences and, finally, passages.
      While giving dictation, various sounds attached to each letter (different
sound values according to the initial, medial, final, etc., positions in which a
letter occurs) may be kept in mind and the teacher may choose such words and
sentences which are likely to be more diificult, hence requiring more practice.
                                  •   "" •   xix          .•.      .     • • ; > ,
Some examples for these are words with aspirated stop sounds such as
6um1, OJDOO, Gdir>ejo, tuooo, raujooftcroi, ecaJo.crooeaio, words containing nasals
plus homorganic stops such as (sracnjigsi, ruarsKS),,, cusni"", sisip^ano, cua>jgo,
         ffismoejo, CSTBOCOO , etc., words with intervocalic voiceless stops such as
         6)<&orm1, ruo.oja.0, fiJAnio, etc., a n d ones with c o n s o n a n t clusters
represented by conjunct letters such as oa>(Q2>°, -aJisgriJ, culeuaudb, 6i6)orura(jny1,
etc. When the objective of the learner is only to master the ability to represent
the letters correctly, it is better that the teacher adopts the reading pronuncia-
tion while giving dictation. While giving passages for dictation, the speed may
be maintained in such a way that the learners may listen and comprehend the
theme and then write, instead of mechanically taking down the passage word
by word.
    Training to write guided composition on the basis of word cues, sentence
cues and picture cues should also be given. The free composition writing
should start from the account, of personal anecdotes of the learners and then
move to more general topics.
      In addition to the materials for developing reading comprehension and
writing compositions, the teacher may also have materials to increase the speed
of reading and writing. Lastly, for the development of any skill, to avoid the
monotony of second language learning through various types of drills and
exercises, and to accelerate the learning process, the teacher should]make'use]of
audiovisual aids such as tapes, records, cards, pictures, slips, charts, models,
film-strips, etc., and should involve the learners in activities such as role play,
narration, discussions and debates. Interesting news items and cartoons,
etc., from contemporary newspapers and periodicals may also be imaginatively
used for effective imparting of language skills.
To the Learners
     The learners, who would like to use this book on their own, may see to it
that all the drills are practised in right earnest in the order they are given. In
this context they are advised to seek the assistance of a native Malayalam
speaking model or lessons recorded on cassettes to be obtained from the Cen-
tral Institute of Indian Languages, in addition to other source materials refer-
red to earlier in this Introduction. Listening to the lessons available on
cassettes/tapes and to Malayalam programmes of All India Radio from its
Kerala Stations, seeing Malayalam films, and reading contemporary periodi-
cals and books published in Malayalam will facilitate the acquisition of this
language.

                            EDITOR'S NOTE
      Malayalam is the language of Kerala. It is spoken in all the States and
Union Territories of India. Speakers of Malayalam are found all over the .
world. . Malayalam belongs to the Dravidian family of languages and has a
highly cultivated literary history of its own dating back to 11th or 12th cen-
tury, A.D. While the native speakers of Malayalam are known for their enter-
prise, and their eager acceptance of dynamic ideas and a universal outlook,
the language itself is marked by a tremendous variety and vitality in its modern
literary growth. Malayalam language bears a convincing testimony to the
development, the expression and the flowing together of both Dravidian and
Aryan traditions. And Kerala continues to be a land of confluence of different
religions and ideologies. Malayalam language fully reflects this confluence
in its vocabulary.
      While some language learning materials have been published in the past
for. the learning of Malayalam as a second/foreign language, the present work
An Intensive Course in Malayalam is distinct from all the above. For the
first time, a grammatically graded, and comprehensive second/foreign language
learning Malayalam manual is available. A deliberate control of the situa-
tions, structures, and vocabulary is attempted effectively in this book. Since
a second language student would benefit greatly by a mastery of the script
of the language he is learning, the book adopts a method of presentation which
demands a previous knowledge of Malayalam script. This knowledge can
be easily gained with the help of books referred to in the Introduction.
     While in the past IVialayalam has been learned by speakers of other lan-
guages largely to attend to their immediate transactional needs (notable excep-
tions are easy to identify), in recent times, a large number of school children
and others have begun to learn Malayalam, not only to meet the immediate'or
prospective transactional needs but also to enjoy its literature, and to partici-
pate in and appreciate its cultural and ideological milieu. Hence, the present
volume aims at having a balanced blend to meet the requirements of both
'nstrumental and integrational demands:
    Language teaching, in some sense, is an artificial activity. It requires
breaking the global language into, at times, even arbitrary units. The books
                                     vii
                                       Vlllin the Intensive Course Series are no exception to these inevitable consequences
of the model followed. This was, however, borne in mind all through to keep
the artificial element under control.
     Each language learning manual in the Intensive Course Series coveis
the 'basic' structures of that language used for certain identified topics of com-
mon interest. Lessons are generally presented in the form of conversations.
These lessons are grouped under various units.
     The variables for the choice of dialect through which the materials are
presented, the methods for the administration of exercises and drills in the
class, and other tips for both the teacher and the learner would be found in the
Introduction. It should be emphasized here that the Intensive Course Series
is an integral part of the scheme of language teaching of the Regional Lan-
guage Centres of the Central Institute of Indian Languages. Books in the
Intermediate Course Series and the Advanced Course Series are an extension
of the books published under the Intensive Course Series.","[6, 7, 8]"

                                     PREFACE     An Intensive Course in Malayalam is meant for the adult learners who
would like to learn Malayalam as a second/foreign language. This book,
in its many versions, has been tried out with several batches of learners belong-
ing to different mother tongue groups, and has assumed the present shape
after a long process of designing and redesigning,"" writing and rewriting, and
editing on the basis of learner reactions and responses of a varied sort.
     In the preparation of this book, I am indebted to a number of people
who include my supervisors, students, colleagues and dear ones. I am most
grateful to Dr. D.P. Pattanayak, Director, Central Institute of Indian Lan-
guages, for his guidance in every step during the organisation of the format
and content of this book, for the stimulating discussions I had with him with
regard to various pedagogic and linguistic strategies that underline the pre-
paration of this book and for his constant encouragement in taking up this
work and completing it.
    I owe a deep sense of gratitude to Dr. M.S. Thirumalai, Deputy Director,
Central Institute of Indian Languages, who with his unfailing perseverance,
guided me in the various stages of preparation of this book starting from the
very beginning up to the proof reading stage. But for his persuasion and
timely guidance, this book would not have seen the light of the day.
    I should record my profound thanks to my husband Shri K. V. Srini-
vasan, University of Mysore, who from the point of view of a linguist as well
as that of a second language learner of Malayalam helped me a lot with his
comments and criticisms in deciding the form and content of this book.
    I have to specially acknowledge my several batches of Malayalam students
on whom these materials were tried out and who taught me a great lot while
they learned Malayalam from me.
    I am also thankful to my former and present colleagues of the Regional
Language Centres and the Central Institute of Indian Languages whose ' opi-
nions and comments helped me considerably in preparing this book. Among
them I would like to specially mention the names of Dr. U.P. Upadhyaya,
Dr. Reginald Soloman and Dr. S. Rajaram.
      I must now thank my teacher Dr. V.R. Prabodhachandran Nair, Pro-
 fessor, Department of Linguistics, University of Kerala who reviewed this
 book in its manuscript form and gave several constructive suggestions.
   2—3CIIL/M/8O           ,      .
     I am also grateful to Dr. E. Annamalai, Deputy Director, Central Insti-
tute of Indian languages and Dr. K.V.V.L. Narasimha Rao, Principal, Sou-
thern Regional Language Centre for the discussions I had with them during
the preparation of this book.
     I also feel indebted to my former and present colleagues of Malayalam
faculty of the Centre, Dr. R. Veera Manikanthan Pillai, Dr. (Smt.) L. Vimala,
Dr. P.T. Abraham, Dr. K. Regu and Shri Saratchandran Nair who used
these materials to teach Malayalam to the learners in the Southern Regional
Language Centre and enriched me with their comments.
    I am greatly indebted to my parents, brothers, and sister and my teachers
of Malayalam and Linguistics who always inspired and encouraged me to
have a deeper insight into Malayalam language and literature. I must also
thank the scholars and writers of Malayalam whom I chanced to meet and
with whom I had many useful discussions relating to the teaching of Mala-
yalam to non-Malayalis, during my visits to several parts of Kerala, while
accompanying my students for their Language Environment Programmes.
     I immensely thank Smt. K. Vasanthy and Kum. T. Radhamoni, former
and present Malayalam typists of the Southern Regional Language Centre
for copying and typing the manuscripts of this book several times on all occa-
sions of revision and finalisation of the press copy.
    I also thank profusely Shri T.S. Venkataraman, Manager of the Press,
Central Institute of Indian Languages, the Publication Unit of the Institute,
and the Government of India Press, Coimbatore for the efforts they took in
bringing this book out.
     I am grateful to Sri N.H. Itagi, Central Institute of Indian Languages
for designing the jacket.
     Most of all, I am in great debt to my loving sisters-in-law Smt. Chaya
Satyanarayan and Kum. K.V. Anasuya who shouldered all my responsibilities
elated to my household and my three kids, while I was immersed in the prepa-
ration of this book and its field testing for more than eight years.
     I shall be extremely grateful, if the casual readers, second language learn-
ers/teachers, professional linguists, materials producers and critics, who would
read this book, send their comments and criticisms along with suggestions
for further improvement of this book.
