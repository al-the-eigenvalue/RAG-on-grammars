      3.1 Distinctive grammatical properties of the subject
      (a) Category
          The prototypical subject has the form of an NP. In [2], for example, identification of the
          subject is completely straightforward on this basis:
         [2] i The moral objections are more important.
             ii An upturned seat lay across the path.
         In [i] there is only one NP; in [ii] there are two, but the second, the path, is complement
         within the PP across the path and hence does not function directly in the structure of
         the clause. These examples were chosen as ones where the order can be reversed (More
         important are the moral objections ; Across the path lay an upturned seat) without changing
         the subject.
             Subordinate clauses can also function as subject, as in That he was guilty was obvious
         to everyone; such subjects are, however, non-prototypical, as is reflected in the existence
         of a more frequent (non-canonical) alternant in which the subject function is assumed
         by the dummy NP it and the subordinate clause is extraposed: It was obvious to everyone
         that he was guilty. Other categories appear as subject only under very restrictive condi-
         tions. The major issue, therefore, is what distinguishes a subject NP from NPs in other
         clause functions, especially object.      (b) Position
          The default position of the subject is before the predicator, external to the VP constituent.
          In transitive clauses, linear order is the most important factor distinguishing the subject
          from the object, whose basic position is after the predicator, internal to the VP.
             Compare, for example, the following, with you as S, their arguments as O:
         [3]         S before P                           O before P [ungrammatical]
                                                         ∗
                i a. You heard their arguments.       b. You their arguments heard.
               ii a. Their arguments you heard.       b. ∗Their arguments heard you.
         Version [ia] illustrates the basic order S–P–O. In [iia] the object is preposed, but the
         subject remains in the position before the predicator. The [b] examples have the object
                                      § 3.1 Distinctive grammatical properties of the subject      237
   before the predicator, and both are completely ungrammatical. S can be separated from
   P by an adjunct (You never heard their arguments), but not by a complement. Non-
   canonical constructions where S follows P involve subject–auxiliary inversion or subject
   postposing: see (e)–(f) below and §3.2.3.(c) Case
    In finite clauses a personal pronoun with distinct nominative and accusative forms
    appears in the nominative when subject, and in the accusative when object: compare
    I know them (with nominative I as S, accusative them as O) and They know me (nominative
    they as S, accusative me as O).
        In many languages case plays the major role in distinguishing subject and object,
    and in such languages the order of elements is characteristically very free. In English,
    however, the loss of any inflectional distinction between nominative and accusative
    except in a handful of pronouns has resulted in order becoming the primary marker
    of clause functions, and this limits the scope for varying the order, as illustrated above.
    Note that O–P–S is excluded even where the NPs are pronouns with a nominative–
    accusative contrast: ∗Them know I. This underlines the slender role of case in English
    syntax: typically in a language with case-marked subject and object, such positional
    reversals are permitted.(d) Agreement
    Person–number inflection in the verb is determined by agreement with the subject:
   [4] i The minister knows the candidates.                  [knows agrees with the minister]
       ii The candidates know the minister.                 [know agrees with the candidates]
   As with case, verb agreement plays a lesser role in marking the subject in Present-day
   English than in many languages, and again this is due to the large-scale loss of inflectional
   contrasts: leaving aside the verb be, there is no person–number inflection in the preterite,
   and in the present tense we have only a two-way contrast between 3rd person singular
   and any other person–number combination (as in the above knows vs know). Thus in
   You know the candidates the verb-form know provides no indication that the subject is
   you. It is worth observing, however, that although more often than not the subject is not
   directly identifiable by pronominal case and verbal person–number, inflection still has a
   significant indirect role: the subject status of you in You know the candidates is indicated
   by the fact that if we replace you by she the form required will be nominative she and
   know will have to be replaced by 3rd person singular knows.(e) Subject–auxiliary inversion
    In closed interrogative main clauses and various other constructions, the subject follows
    the predicator instead of preceding it, as in canonical clauses: compare canonical She can
    swim and She likes it with closed interrogative Can she swim? and Does she like it? The
    predicator has to be an auxiliary verb, and these constructions are accordingly said to
    involve subject–auxiliary inversion.
         This property provides an indirect way of identifying the subject in structures not
    illustrating inversion: you can be confirmed as subject of You know the candidates because
    it is you that comes to occupy the post-auxiliary position when we convert this declarative
    to the corresponding closed interrogative Do you know the candidates?
238           Chapter 4 The clause: complements
      (f) Open interrogatives
          The rules forming open interrogatives likewise distinguish sharply between subject and
          non-subject elements:
         [5]        i Who bought it?                           [interrogative element as subject: basic order]
                   ii What did you buy?                [interrogative element as non-subject: inverted order]
             If the interrogative element is subject, the order is the same as in the declarative
             (cf. Someone bought it), but if it is non-subject, then the interrogative element is usually
             placed in front position, triggering subject–auxiliary inversion.      (g) Tags
          Interrogative tags attached to a declarative clause contain a subject pronoun that agrees
          with the subject of that clause:
         [6] i You know the others, don’t you?
             ii The candidates know the minister, don’t they?
             The tag has the form of an elliptical closed interrogative consisting of auxiliary + personal
             pronoun, the choice of pronoun being determined by the subject of the declarative: you
             agrees with you in [i], they with the candidates in [ii] (see Ch. 10, §5.1). Note that this
             holds even when the declarative clause does not have the elements in the basic order, as
             in The others you know, don’t you?; Even clearer is the second point, isn’t it?      (h) Coordination
          Since its default position is external to the VP, the subject can enter straightforwardly
          into construction with a VP-coordination:
         [7]          Sue typed the letter and posted it herself.
             This illustrates what we call ‘basic coordination’, where the coordinates typed the letter
             and posted it herself both have the status of constituents in the clauses Sue typed the
             letter and Sue posted it herself. It is to be distinguished from the much less frequent
             non-basic coordination Sue typed, and her father posted, the letter : here the coordinates
             Sue typed and her father posted are not normal constituents in that they don’t have
             constituent status in the clauses Sue typed the letter and Her father posted the letter. (This
             is reflected by the commas and the corresponding sharp prosodic breaks when spoken.)
             A prototypical subject has, therefore, the distinctive property that it can combine with
             a basic coordination where the coordinate parts consist of the verb together with other
             dependents.      (i) Obligatoriness
          In general, the subject is an obligatory element: subjectless clauses are found only in cer-
          tain specific non-canonical constructions such as non-finites and imperatives.19 Whether
          a clause has an object or not depends on the lexical properties of the verb (e.g. appear
          excludes one, while use normally requires one), but a subject is required in all canonical
          clauses.
             One corollary of this is that English has dummy subjects, as in It is raining or It is
          time to go home, where it satisfies the syntactic need for a subject but has no identifiable        19
             Or in casual style, where certain pronoun subjects may be ellipted at the beginning of a main clause, as in Had
             a marvellous time at the beach yesterday, with “I” understood (see Ch. 17, §7.8.1).
                                                            § 3.2 Subject in non-canonical clauses    239
    meaning. The fact that the subject is obligatory is reflected in the possibilities for reducing
    clauses when material is recoverable from the context. Sue has eaten them already, say,
    can be reduced to She has (e.g. in answer to the question Has Sue eaten them already?), but
    not to ∗Has or ∗Has eaten. She has is what we will refer to as a maximal finite reduction,
    i.e. a finite clause that can’t be reduced any further, and this construction must contain
    a subject together with an auxiliary or the pro-form do. (j) Uniqueness
     There can be no more than one subject per clause. By contrast it is possible for a clause
     to contain two objects (though of different subtypes), as in She gave me the key.
        Notice that in examples like Jane and her husband are right we have a coordination
     of NPs, not of subjects: Jane and her husband constitutes a single subject. For exam-
     ple, agreement and tags treat the coordination as a whole as subject, not the separate
     parts: the verb required with Jane and her husband is are, and the tag would be aren’t
     they?","[256, 257, 258, 259]"
"        It should be clear that the term ‘preposition’ is by no means ideal for our purposes, for it is
        etymologically divisible into a base position and a prefix pre · meaning “before”. However, the
        term is so thoroughly established that we have found it best to retain it despite the shift in
        sense, and the application to a category of words not defined by linear order at all.
             It is helpful that the first syllable of ‘preposition’ is pronounced /pre/, as in prep (“home-
        work”), not /pri/, as in pre-war, where the “before” meaning is transparent. Preposition thus
        falls together with such words as supposition or proposition, in which there is no longer a
        prefix that makes an independent contribution to the meaning.
             There are languages where words of the category in question characteristically follow the
        NP complement, as in Japanese, and in grammars of such languages they are generally called
        ‘postpositions’. However, in most such languages transitive verbs follow their objects, so again
        order is not distinctive. Rather, there is a general typological distinction between head +
        complement and complement + head languages. The term ‘postposition’ is transparently
        analysable into a meaningful prefix and a base, and when it is contrasted with ‘preposition’
        the etymological meaning of ‘pre·’ is revived.
             Because position relative to the complement reflects general typological features, one
        wouldn’t want to regard Japanese postpositions as representing a different primary category
        from English prepositions. For example, the phrase T ōky ō ni clearly has a structure parallel
        to that of its English translation to Tokyo. The term ‘adposition’ is accordingly used by some
        linguists as a more general term covering both ‘postposition’ and ‘preposition’. This term
        is not used, however, to form a term for the phrases headed by adpositions. There is no
        established term ‘adposition phrase’.
             It has to be recognised, therefore, that the term ‘preposition’ is ambiguous. In one sense
        it is neutral as to linear position, and in the other it is restricted to words which precede their
        complements. In this book we are using it in the former sense, but since we are describing a
        language where these words do characteristically precede their complements the dual usage
        should not create any problems. All that is necessary here is that the reader should see that
        in our sense of the term there is no contradiction in saying that the weather notwithstanding
        is a preposition phrase headed by the preposition notwithstanding.
                                       § 2 Distinctive properties of prepositions in English   603
 General definition
  The number of prepositions is far smaller than the number of nouns, verbs, adjectives, or
  adverbs, and though new prepositions are added to the language from time to time there
  is no freely productive morphological process for forming them. We have pointed out that
  the removal of the traditional requirement that all prepositions take NP complements
  means that the class is somewhat larger than is often suggested, but in comparison with
  the others it remains a relatively closed class (i.e. one that does not readily accept the
  addition of new members).
      The most central members have meanings which, at least in origin, have to do with
  relations in space. The situation may be either static (Kim is in Boston) or dynamic (Kim
  went to Boston). The most frequent preposition, of, derives from a word meaning “away
  from”. This feature of prepositions, together with their grammaticised uses, provides the
  basis for a general definition of the category along the following lines:
  [9]      preposition: a relatively closed grammatically distinct class of words whose
                        most central members characteristically express spatial relations
                        or serve to mark various syntactic functions and semantic roles.","[622, 623]"

"3.1.1 Basic reflexives in verb domains
    Where antecedent and pronoun are related to the same verb, a reflexive form is almost
    always admissible; when they are both related to it directly, rather than via a preposition,
    the reflexive is (with one minor exception) mandatory.
        In clauses with canonical constituent order, a reflexive must follow its antecedent. For
    this reason, the antecedent is usually the subject of the clause – and the subject cannot
    itself be reflexive:
    [12] i Sue defended herself.                                        [subject as antecedent]
             ∗
          ii Herself defended Sue.                                [subject as reflexive anaphor]
          We will review in turn the various functions where verb domain reflexives occur in
       the simplest constructions, and then turn briefly to clauses with non-canonical order. (a) Reflexive pronoun in direct object function
     Here the antecedent is subject and the reflexive mandatory:18
    [13] i The protesters chained themselves to the Embassy railings.
         ii Tim considered himself a victim of the system.
        iii Liz believes herself to be suitable for the job.
        iv Everyone committed themselves to continuing the fight.
         v Sue was the only one [who defended herself ].
       These examples illustrate reflexive objects in a range of transitive constructions.
       Example [i] represents the elementary case where antecedent and pronoun represent
       arguments of the same verb. In [ii] we have a complex-transitive clause with the object
       himself predicand for the following predicative complement. In [iii] herself is a raised
       object (Ch. 14, §3.1.1). These first three examples have the pronoun coreferential with
       the antecedent, while [iv] illustrates again the case where a pronoun expresses a bound
       variable, as discussed for non-reflexive forms in §2.3.2. In [v] anaphor and antecedent
       are located within a subordinate (relative) clause.19
       Verbs that select mandatory reflexives
       A number of verbs select objects that are required to be anaphorically linked with the
       subject, and these must then be reflexive in form:
    [14] i a. He cried himself to sleep that night.                     b. Ed prides himself on his tolerance.
         ii a. Ann acquitted herself extremely well.                    b. You express yourself very clearly.
       Example [ia] illustrates the special case where a reflexive object occurs with a basically
       intransitive verb: the object is not an argument of the verb, but enables it to take a  18
     In the ditransitive construction it is in principle possible for the direct object to have the indirect object as
     antecedent, but in practice pragmatic factors normally exclude an anaphoric relation between the two objects,
     so that examples like #They sold the slave himself (“They sold the slave to himself ”) are at best highly contrived.
     With some verbs a reflexive object can be omitted without loss of meaning: Ed shaved, for example, is generally
     interpreted as equivalent to Ed shaved himself: see Ch. 4, §8.1.3.
  19
     The feminine gender of the pronoun in [13v] matches that of Sue although there is no anaphoric link (not
     even an anaphoric chain) between Sue and herself : the matrix clause specifies identity between Sue and the
     referent of the second NP, so that the feature “female” is assigned to one and hence to the relative pronoun
     who, the antecedent of the reflexive.
1488          Chapter 17 Deixis and anaphora
             resultative goal or predicative (see Ch. 4, §5.3). Pride, used as in [ib], doesn’t allow a
             non-reflexive object at all. Acquit does allow non-reflexive objects, but only in a different
             sense (They acquitted her), and express with a human-denoting object also belongs in
             this class (we don’t find #You express me perfectly). Other verbs of this kind are given in
             [15]; some take PP complements as indicated in addition to the object, as pride in [ib]
             takes an on phrase. Those marked † are like pride in having a reflexive as the only (or
             virtually the only) type of object permitted:
          [15]        absent (from) †            apply (to)          avail (of ) †         behave †              busy †
                      comport †                  compose             conduct               content               demean
                      enjoy                      excel               exert                 ingratiate †          perjure †       (b) Indirect object
          [16]        a. Liz didn’t leave herself enough time.              b. I bought myself a new car.
             Again, the antecedent is subject, and the reflexive mandatory – except that in some
             dialects, mainly US, an accusative is found in informal style as a variant of the reflexive.
             This usage occurs predominantly with a 1st person pronoun: %I bought me a new car;
             %
              Let’s get us a hamburger.20       (c) Predicative complement
          [17]        a. I’m not feeling myself today.                      b. You should just try to be yourself.
             Once more, the antecedent is subject and the reflexive mandatory. It is, however, relatively
             rare for the predicative complement to be anaphorically linked to the subject, and both
             [i] and [ii] here are idiomatic. Example [i], with the verb feel, means roughly “I’m not
             feeling completely well” or “I’m not feeling in good spirits”, while [ii], with be, means
             “You should just try to act naturally”. There is one case where the non-reflexive is strongly
             favoured, namely where the proposition is concerned with identity: If you weren’t you,
             who would you like to be?       (d) Object of preposition
           We turn now to constructions where the pronoun is related to the verb not directly but
           via a preposition. The structural relation between pronoun and antecedent is thus not so
           close as in (a)–(c), and here a reflexive may have any of the three statuses we have defined:
           mandatory, optional, or inadmissible. These are illustrated in [18i–iii] respectively:
          [18]            reflexive form                                        non-reflexive form
                    i a. He was beside himself with anger.                  b. ∗He was beside him with anger.
                   ii a. Liz wrapped the rug around herself.                b. Liz wrapped the rug around her.
                  iii a. ∗I haven’t any money on myself.                    b. I haven’t any money on me.
             Mandatory reflexives
             This represents much the most common pattern and can be regarded as the default
             case. Further examples are given in [19], where the pronoun cannot be replaced by a
             non-reflexive form with the same antecedent.
        20
             The meaning, however, is not always quite the same. While I caught myself some fish implies that the fish were
             specifically for me, %I caught me some fish does not. There is also a non-standard use of me where the standard
             dialect would not have an indirect object at all: !I seen me a mermaid once; !I want me a house by the beach.
                                                     § 3.1.1 Basic reflexives in verb domains     1489
[19] i a. He doesn’t look after himself.             b. She believes in herself.
     ii a. He thinks of himself as overworked.       b. Can’t you do anything for yourself?
    iii a. I never get any time to myself.           b. Max had done it by himself.
This case includes PPs functioning as complement of prepositional verbs (Ch. 4, §6.1) –
for example, after in [ia] is selected by look, in in [ib] by believe, and so on. Also in this
category are constructions where the object of the preposition is predicand for a pred-
icative complement, as in [iia]. In [iiia–b], and also [18ia], the complement is required
to be anaphorically linked to the subject: the reflexive is selected by the preposition,
or the idiom containing it. Thus ∗I never get any time to him is impossible, while Max
had done it by me and He was beside her have only the literal locative senses of by and
beside.
   The antecedent in all these examples is the subject; it is also possible, though very
much less usual, for the antecedent to be the object of the verb or even of a preposition:
[20] i I had to save Mary from herself.
     ii [Tim praises Mary to herself ] but criticises her to everyone else.
    iii He told Mary about herself as a young girl.
    iv Liz talked to Tim about himself.
These are still in accordance with the general rule that the antecedent precedes the
reflexive anaphor. In the double PP construction [iv], the to phrase normally precedes
the about phrase (?Liz talked about Tim to himself ), but the reverse order is possible in
a context of contrast (Liz talked about Tim to himself very differently from the way she
talked about him to her friends).
Optional reflexives
[21] i Rhiana saw a spider near her/herself.
     ii Phil kept the radio next to him/himself the whole trip.
    iii Mary made sure [she directed the stream of champagne away from her/herself ].
The governing prepositions indicate spatial location, with the PPs being either adjuncts,
as in [i], or complements, as in [ii–iii]; the antecedent is in all cases subject. There is
variation across speakers and also particular examples, but for many the non-reflexive
form is preferred except in contexts of contrast (e.g. Tim wanted the radio but Phil insisted
on keeping it next to himself the whole trip).
Inadmissible reflexives
[22] i She looked about/around her/∗herself.
     ii He liked having children around him/∗himself.
    iii They took their cousin with them/∗themselves.
    iv You have your whole adult life before you/∗yourself.
The prepositions again involve spatial location (though with a metaphorical interpreta-
tion in [iv]). The complements of the preposition are required to be anaphorically linked
to the subject, so that we can’t say, with the same interpretation of verb and preposi-
tion, ∗She looked about him, ∗He liked having children around me, and so on. In this
respect they are like [18ia] and [19iiia–b], but this time it is the non-reflexive form that is
required.
1490      Chapter 17 Deixis and anaphora
        Non-canonical constituent order
         The basic rule, we have noted, is that a reflexive pronoun must follow its antecedent. It
         can precede the antecedent, however, in cases of preposing:
        [23] i To herself, the coordinator allocated the first watch.
             ii Himself, he excused from these onerous duties.
         These correspond to the canonical structures:
        [24] i The coordinator allocated the first watch to herself.
             ii He excused himself from these onerous duties.
         In [24] the order is determined by the basic rule, and in [23] the choice as to which
         of the linked NPs is treated as anaphor and which as antecedent is the same as in the
         corresponding canonical structure. Again, then, we cannot have a reflexive as subject of
         a main clause: ∗To the coordinatori , herselfi had allocated the first watch.
            Where the antecedent is object rather than subject (as in [20i], I had to save Mary
         from herself ) such a reversal of the order of a reflexive and its antecedent is in principle
         possible in clauses with heavy-object postposing, but in practice examples of this kind
         are of questionable acceptability:
                 ?
        [25]     Tim was not able to save from herself even the ordinary middle-class girl he had
                 met in the drug rehabilitation clinic.","[1507, 1508, 1509, 1510]"
" Ditransitives and their related passives
  Two passive constructions need to be distinguished according to which object the passive
  subject corresponds to:
  [10] i a. I sent Sue a copy.                  b. I ordered Sue a copy.
       ii a. Sue was sent a copy.               b. ?Sue was ordered a copy.                        [first passive]
      iii a. ?A copy was sent Sue.              b. ∗A copy was ordered Sue.                     [second passive]
  We use the term first passive for the one where the subject corresponds to the first object,
  Oi , and second passive for [iii], where it corresponds to the second object, Od . These
  terms also reflect the order of preference: the first passive tends to be quite strongly
  favoured over the second. Ditransitive verbs vary considerably in how readily they occur
  in passive clauses. In general, where Oi corresponds to the complement of to in the
  prepositional alternant [7i], characteristically having the semantic role of recipient, the
  first passive is fully acceptable, as in [10iia]; judgements vary as to the acceptability of
  second passives like [10iiia]: many find them unacceptable,24 and they are textually quite
  rare. Where Oi corresponds to the complement of for in [7ii], with the semantic role
  of beneficiary, neither passive is completely acceptable, but many speakers find the first
  marginally possible.",[269]
"  Lexicalised coordinations
  A large number of coordinations – mainly pairs of words joined by and or or – are
  partially or fully lexicalised. The fully lexicalised ones constitute composite lexical items
  with the order completely fixed and with meanings generally not fully predictable from
  those of the coordinates and the coordinator:
  [37] aid and abet               betwixt and between by and large         common or garden
          first and foremost hem and haw                 high and dry      hither and yon
          let or hindrance        part and parcel        rhyme or reason rough and ready
          rough and tumble spick and span                to and fro        well and truly
1288      Chapter 15 Coordination and supplementation
         Some of these contain words that no longer occur in contemporary English other than
         in the coordination: fro, hem, spick, etc.
             Partially lexicalised coordinations are combinations where the items regularly go
         together in a particular order; reversal is not impossible but represents a quite sharp
         departure from the expected order:
        [38]       buy and sell             come and go                  cup and saucer           cuts and bruises
                   fish and chips           for and against              friend and foe           head and shoulders 6
                   hope and pray            husband and wife             life and death           loud and clear
                   meek and mild            tried and tested
            In both [37] and [38] the coordinates are often either near-synonyms (tried /tested,
         meek/mild , first /foremost) or opposites of one kind or another (come /go, husband /
         wife , buy/sell ).7        Ordering tendencies
         In many cases, the fixed or preferred order of coordinates in fully or partially lexicalised
         coordinations reflects certain tendencies that favour one order over another in ordinary,
         non-lexicalised coordinations too.8
         (a) Temporal order
         Coordinates denoting periods or points of time tend to be ordered so as to match the
         temporal order: past, present, and future ; yesterday, today, and tomorrow; the morning,
         afternoon, and evening; sooner or later; on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.Similarly with
         states ordered in time, as in life and death, or parts of a whole, as beginning and end.
         (b) Spatial hierarchy
         With items arranged on the vertical dimension, there is a tendency to put the higher
         before the lower: up and down , upstairs and downstairs , upper and lower, above and
         below , head and shoulders, top and bottom. It may be that this order reflects the greater
         salience of the higher in important cases like above and below ground, above and below the
         horizon, and arguably a similar salience hierarchy is reflected on the horizontal dimension
         in the ordering of front and back, fore and aft, etc.
         (c) Deixis
         The order in here and there, hither and thither, now and then, this and that reflects a deictic
         hierarchy, with the reference of the first coordinate being closer to the deictic centre, the
         time and place of the speech act. With the category of person, however, the hierarchy is
         overridden by a convention of politeness, which has 1st person in final position. Compare
         you and your sister (which accords with the hierarchy: 2nd person before 3rd) and my
         sister and I (reversing the hierarchy, with 3rd person before 1st).9        6
          This is fully lexicalised in its metaphorical sense: This model is head and shoulders above the rest.
        7
          Comparable to lexicalisation is institutionalisation in the form of proper names – of books, public houses,
          organisations, etc. Many such names consist of or include coordinations, and the order of the coordinates is
          of course fixed as part of the name: Pride and Prejudice ; the Hare and Hounds ; the Department of Employment,
          Education and Training.
        8
          Lexicalisation may also have been facilitated in expressions following certain phonologically favoured pat-
          terns, such as shorter before longer (in terms of number of syllables, stuff and nonsense, out and about,
          or length of vowel, stress and strain, brush and comb), high vowels before low in monosyllables (dribs
          and drabs, fits and starts), more sonorant before less sonorant initial consonant (high and dry, hope and
          pray).
        9
          Non-standard !Me and my sister were alone simply follows the deictic hierarchy. With time and space factors
          (a) and (b) may outweigh (c): yesterday, today, and tomorrow ; up there and down here.
                                                                § 2 Coordinators and related linking items                 1289
      (d) Polarity and evaluation
      Positive terms tend to precede negatives: yes and no, admit or deny , accept or refuse,
      with or without. The concepts of positive and negative are extended to many scales of
      evaluation, and it is again the positive (more highly valued) term that tends to come first:
      good and bad , for [better or worse], friend or foe , right or wrong. The concepts are also
      relevant to pairs like come and go and arrive and depart, where the positive–negative
      contrast is a matter of being at a certain place and not being there.
      (e) Social hierarchy
      Another tendency is for the order to reflect social status: employers and employees ; officers
      and men ; peers and commoners. Two special cases of this hierarchy rank adults above
      children and males above females: father and son ; Mr and Mrs ; the Duke and Duchess of
      Penzance; husband and wife; brothers and sisters; he or she; men, women, and children.
      The male–female order is reversed, however, in Ladies and Gentlemen; bride and groom;
      mums and dads.10 Precisely because the usual male–female order can be seen as reflecting
      the social hierarchy, it can be regarded as a case of ‘sexism’ in language – and it may then
      be consciously reversed for that reason; it has, however, received very much less attention
      and criticism than more obvious cases of sexist language such as the use of masculine
      terms like he to subsume females (Ch. 5, §17.2.4).","[1307, 1308, 1309]"

4.1 The object in canonical monotransitive clauses
   The object has fewer distinctive properties than the other core complements: it is charac-
   terised as much by the absence of S and PC properties as by the presence of clear positive
   properties of its own.(a) Category: normally NP
    The prototypical object has the form of an NP. Thus He entered the lounge has the lounge
    as O, but there is no object in He went into the lounge, where the internal complement
    into the lounge has the form of a PP. Similarly, the Os are as underlined in the following
    pairs:
   [1]    i a. He climbed the mountain.        b. He climbed up the mountain.
         ii a. He supplied eggs to them.       b. He supplied them with eggs.
   Again, the PPs up the mountain, to them, with eggs are non-core complements, not
   objects. NPs readily occur as S or PC, so this property serves to differentiate objects from
   non-core complements and adjuncts. It is not fully decisive, however, since a limited
246          Chapter 4 The clause: complements
            range of NPs are found in these latter functions, as in They went that way, She arrived
            this morning.22 Subordinate clauses show varying degrees of similarity to NP objects,
            but (with minor exceptions) we prefer to use the more general term complement for
            them in view of the absence of well-motivated criteria to determine which are objects
            and which are not (see Ch. 11, §8.3).      (b) Selective obligatoriness
          Although there is a great deal of overlap between the classes of transitive and intran-
          sitive verbs, we nevertheless find some which require an O, at least for a given sense
          of the verb (and excluding highly restricted contexts). Thus the O is non-omissible
          in such examples as: He accosted her; We kept the old battery; He delineated the
          problem; This entailed a considerable delay ; We forced a showdown ; I used a knife ; and
          so on.      (c) Correspondence to passive subject
          The object of an active clause prototypically corresponds to the subject of a related
          passive:
         [2]         a. Pat overlooked the error. [O]             b. The error [S] was overlooked (by Pat).
         The term ‘related passive’ applies to the actual passive counterpart (The error was over-
         looked by Pat) or one differing from the latter by the absence of the by phrase, the
         internalised complement (The error was overlooked ).
            It must be emphasised, however, that such a correspondence does not hold for all
         objects, and that the subject of a passive does not always correspond to the object of the
         verb in the active:
         [3] i a. His uncle owned two yachts.          b. Two yachts were owned by his uncle.
              ii a. His uncle had two yachts.          b. ∗Two yachts were had by his uncle.
             iii a. He has drunk out of this glass.    b. This glass has been drunk out of.
            We see from [i–ii] that there is a related passive when the verb is own but not when
            it is have, and yet there is no independent syntactic evidence for assigning different
            functions to two yachts. Whether or not there is an acceptable related passive for a
            given active clause depends on the interaction of pragmatic, semantic, syntactic, and
            lexical factors: it cannot satisfactorily be reduced to a simple matter of the presence or
            absence of O in the active. Example [iii] illustrates the second point, that it is not only
            transitive clauses that have related passives. This glass in [a] corresponds to the subject
            of the passive [b], but it is functioning as complement of a preposition, not as object of
            drink.
                 Nevertheless, correspondence with a passive subject is an important property of
            objects and provides a valuable diagnostic which we will call the passivetest: if a core com-
            plement NP of an active clause can be converted into the subject of a related passive, then
            it is an object. This formulation excludes this glass in [iii] since it is not a core complement.
            And it provides a sufficient but not a necessary condition: two yachts passes the test in       22
            In special cases, moreover, it is possible for an object to have the form of a PP, as in He considered
            under the mat an unsafe place for the key : note that under here does not serve to relate the mat to consider
            or he.
                                                            § 4.2 Object and extraposed object        247
   [i] and hence qualifies as an object, but the fact that it fails the test in [ii] does not mean
   that two yachts is not here an object.(d) Position
    The prototypical position for O is immediately after P. Non-parenthetical adjuncts can-
    not normally intervene between P and O: She saw Tom often or She often saw Tom, but
    not ∗She saw often Tom.
       The main departures from this order are illustrated in the [b] members of the following
    pairs, where underlining marks P and O:
   [4]     i a. He brought the clothes in.    b. He brought in the clothes.
          ii a. I returned the books to Jo.   b. I returned to Jo all the books I’d borrowed.
         iii a. She rejected the others.      b. The others she rejected.
   In [ib] O is separated from P by in, which we refer to as a ‘particle’ (cf. §6.2); this order is
   not permitted when O is an unstressed personal pronoun (∗He brought in it). In [iib] an
   O that is heavy is placed in end position (see Ch. 16, §4 for details) – in [iia], by contrast,
   the O is not heavy enough and must precede the PP (∗I returned to Jo the books). In [iii],
   the default order is as in [a], while [b] is an instance of the preposing construction, with
   the others occupying the prenuclear position; O can also occur in this position in open
   interrogatives (Which ones did she reject?) and various other unbounded dependency
   constructions (cf. Ch. 12, §7).","[265, 266, 267]"
"Various non-syntactic criteria have been proposed as differentiating between composite
nominals and compound nouns, as in such pairs as composite black bird (“bird which
is black”) and blackbird (“species of bird”):
[28] i stress: the composite nominal has primary stress on the second element (black-
        ⎜                                                ⎜
         bird ), while the compound has it on the first ( blackbird ).
     ii orthography: the composite nominal is written as two orthographic words,
        the compound as one.
    iii meaning: while the meaning of the composite nominal is straightforwardly
        predictable from the component parts, that of the compound is not – it is
        specialised, denoting a particular species.
    iv productivity: in the composite nominal the dependent can be replaced by any
        other adjective that is semantically compatible with the head, whereas there is a
        quite limited number of compounds with the form Adj + bird.
The correlation between these criteria and the syntactic tests of coordination and mod-
ification is, however, very imperfect, and since we are concerned with the delimitation
of a syntactic construction we will naturally give precedence to the syntactic tests in the
many cases of divergent results.
In the first place, there are many combinations that clearly pass the tests for composite no-
minals that have primary stress on the first element – forms like biology teacher, cooking
apple, television screen, income tax. Conversely, there are some compounds, such as full stop
(“period”) or, for many speakers, hotdog, that have stress on the second element.
    Orthography does not provide a decisive criterion because in many cases there are alternant
forms: daisy wheel, daisy-wheel, or daisywheel, for example. And there are compounds, such
as the above full stop, that are written as two orthographic words.
    Thirdly, semantic specialisation may be found in composite nominals as well as com-
pounds. The coordination desktop and internet publishing, for example, shows desktop pub-
lishing to be a composite nominal, but the meaning is specialised, since it denotes publishing
by use of computer programs accessible to a desktop computer, rather than publishing using
the top of a desk. Conversely, the meaning of such compounds as backache or raindrop is as
transparent as that of numerous composite nominals.
    Finally productivity is a gradient matter, and cannot provide a criterion for a binary
distinction. Syntactic processes are overall more productive than morphological ones within
the lexicon, but this is a tendency, not a matter of productive vs non-productive.
452      Chapter 5 Nouns and noun phrases
      15 Order of elements in NP structure        The preceding sections have introduced the main kinds of dependents that we distinguish
        in describing NP structure, and we must now say something further about the order
        in which they occur. The ordering constraints are of two kinds, which we call rigid
        and labile ordering constraints. Violation of a rigid ordering contraint results in clear
        ungrammaticality, as when the determiner is placed after the head instead of before it –
        compare the unicorn and ∗unicorn the. A labile ordering constraint, on the other hand,
        gives the preferred order in the default case: departures from this order will often be of
        questionable acceptability but they may also be justified by considerations of scope and
        information packaging. Compare:
        [1]    i I want to buy [a large black sofa] / ?[a black large sofa].
              ii I want to buy a [black large sofa], not those other colours of large sofa you insist on
                 showing me.
        In the absence of special factors, a modifier of size precedes one of colour: a large black
        sofa represents the preferred order while a black large sofa is very unnatural. But this
        constraint can be overridden, as in [ii]: the context here is one where it has already been
        established that I want a large sofa, so that now only the colour is at issue. Black is thus
        interpreted restrictively, picking out a subset of the set of large sofas, and in this context
        it can precede large.
            We will represent rigid and labile constraints by means of the symbols ‘>>’ and ‘>’
        respectively: ‘Determiner >> Head’ indicates that the determiner obligatorily precedes
        the head, while ‘General property > Colour’ gives the default order of modifiers of these
        two semantic types.","[471, 472]"

8.2 Non-finite complements of nouns
   Many nouns license non-finite complements, all to-infinitivals:

   The great majority of the head nouns are morphologically derived from (or homonymous
   with) verbs of matching senses that take the same complementation, as with those in
   [i]. Those in [ii] are similarly derived from adjectives, while with those in [iii] the
   complementation is not predictable in this way. Compare then:
  [11] i a Kim decided to go to Bonn.         b. Kim’s decision to go to Bonn
       ii a. Pat was eager to help us.        b. Pat’s eagerness to help us
      iii a. [no relevant counterpart]        b. the opportunity to make a quick profit
   We include strength in [iii], not [ii], because the adjective strong does not take an in-
   finitival complement. Note, then, that the following do not have matching structures or
1260     Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clauses
        interpretations:
        [12] i She was strong to withstand this pressure.
             ii She had the strength to withstand this pressure.
        In [i] the infinitival is an adjunct in the clause; the meaning is that she withstood the
        pressure, this indicating that she was strong. In [ii] the infinitival is a complement, and
        the meaning is “She had the strength necessary to withstand the pressure”.
           All the nouns in [10] take subjectless infinitivals, and those with the annotation ‘F’
        also allow the construction with subordinator for + subject:
        [13] i This provided an opportunity [for them to plan the next step].
             ii Permission [for the ceremony to be held in the church itself ]was finally granted.
        A number of other nouns in our list could probably also occur with for + subject in the
        infinitival, but it is in general a relatively infrequent construction, and judgements as to
        whether a given noun could appear here are not always clear-cut.
            In the subjectless construction, the antecedent for the missing subject may be found
        within the NP (as genitive determiner or within a PP complement), as in [14i], or
        outside the NP, as in [ii], and in cases like [iii] there is no antecedent in the sentence
        at all:
        [14] i a. your /Kim’s promise to help me with my tax return
                 b. a proposal by the government to introduce a goods-and-services tax
                 c. the willingness of the other members to agree to the proposal
                 d. an instruction to the secretary to call an extraordinary meeting
              ii a. They gave me instructions [to evacuate the building].
                 b. I received instructions [to evacuate the building].
                 c. What I hadn’t expected to receive was an instruction [to evacuate the building].
             iii They were discussing a proposal [to introduce a summer semester].
        In general, the recovery of the understood subject is determined by semantic princi-
        ples, not rules of syntax. But in some cases the matter is more grammaticalised; with
        selection, for example, the antecedent is normally required to appear as complement
        to of :
        [15] i The selection of Judge Carter to head the inquiry is to be welcomed.
             ii ∗The selection to head the inquiry hasn’t yet been announced.
            iii ∗Judge Carter is their selection to head the inquiry.
        Nouns do not take raised complements
        In general, clauses with raised complements, licensed by raising verbs or adjectives, do
        not have counterparts with the form of NPs:
        [16] i a. Kim seemed to be distressed.         b. ∗the seeming of Kim to be distressed
             ii a. I believe them to be genuine.       b. ∗my belief in/of them to be genuine
            iii a. They are certain to resent it.      b. ∗their certainty to resent it
        One exception involves the verb tend, which has the noun counterpart tendency. Corres-
        ponding to clausal The tabloids tend to support Labour and the equivalent Labour tends to be
        supported by the tabloids we have:
                                                     § 8.2 Non-finite complements of nouns           1261
[17] i a. the tendency for the tabloids to support Labour
        b. the tendency for Labour to be supported by the tabloids
     ii a. the tendency of the tabloids to support Labour
        b. Labour’s tendency /the tendency of Labour to be supported by the tabloids
In [ia/ib] the tabloids and Labour are subjects of the infinitival clauses, and the equivalence
between the whole NPs simply reflects the equivalence holding between the active and passive
subordinate clauses they contain. In [ii], however, the tabloids and Labour are oblique or
genitive complements of tendency: here, therefore, they appear to bear some resemblance
to raised complements. There is, however, a major difference between the NP and clause
constructions. Dummy elements can occur as raised complements in clause structure, but they
cannot occur as oblique or genitive complement of tendency – or of any other noun. There
does not have a genitive form and cannot normally occur as complement of a preposition,
but these general restrictions do not apply to it, and yet this too cannot be used in the relevant
positions when it is a dummy element:
[18] i a. It tends to be the wife who provides this support.
        b. ∗its tendency to be the wife who provides this support
     ii a. It tends to be more efficient to pay by credit card than by cheque.
        b. ∗its tendency to be more efficient to pay by credit card than by cheque
Such data argue that nouns, unlike verbs and adjectives, do not take raised complements.
We take the tabloids and Labour, therefore, to represent arguments of tendency in [17iia–b]
respectively, though not of course in [17i]. The relation between [17ia] and [17iia] is thus the
same as that between [8ib] and [8ia] of §6.3 (It was hard for Ed to accept her criticism and Her
criticism was hard for Ed to accept).
    The same applies to failure, derived from the raising verb fail. The verb allows dummy
subjects, but the noun does not:
[19] i It had failed to become apparent, even after a day, what their intentions were.
     ii ∗its failure to become apparent, even after a day, what their intentions were
   Consider finally the case of order:
[20] i a. They ordered the building to be evacuated.
        b. #the order to the building to be evacuated
        c. the order for the building to be evacuated
     ii a. They ordered the doctor to examine the victims.
        b. the order to the doctor to examine the victims
        c. the order for the doctor to examine the victims
The verb takes a raised object: the building is not an argument of the verb in [ia]. But with
the noun the complement of to is an argument, with the role of recipient of the order.
Hence the anomaly of [ib]: one doesn’t give orders to buildings. The nominal structure
thus differs from the verbal one in allowing for this role to be explicitly encoded. It does
not have to be, however, for we can also have [ic/iic]: these match the verbal (clausal) con-
struction in not encoding who received the order. Here the building and the doctor function
as subject of the infinitival, not as oblique complement of the noun. Again, then, oblique
complements of the noun are not raised: they have to be interpretable as arguments of the
noun.
1262       Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clauses
       8.3 Non-finite complements in the structure of PPs
         Gerund-participials
          These occur very freely as complement of a preposition:
          [21] i I’m looking forward [to (you/your) returning home].
               ii [On hearing the news] she immediately telephoned her father.
              iii She was reported [as saying that she would appeal against the ruling].
              iv [Although claiming to have a Ph.D.,] he didn’t in fact have any degree at all.
          Although more often occurs with a finite complement (as in although he claimed to have a
          Ph.D.). Such clauses can be reduced to gerund-participials, past-participials, or verbless
          clauses: see [3] of §10 for a list of prepositions of this kind.","[1279, 1280, 1281, 1282]"
" Conclusion
     The dependent-auxiliary analysis has certain attractions for textual analysis, in that it very
     much reduces the amount of embedding that has to be recognised. It may have been raining,
     for example, will be a simple clause instead of a complex one with three layers of embedding.
     Given the high frequency of auxiliary verbs, this will result in a very considerable ‘saving’
     in the analysis of most texts. It is also simpler in that we don’t have to decide which clause
     temporal and similar dependents should be assigned to – e.g. whether at noon belongs with
     be or with sleep in They were still sleeping at noon. And the cases where we have shown
     it to give clearly unacceptable results are textually quite rare. Nevertheless, we believe we
     have shown that from a more theoretical perspective the catenative analysis is very much
     sounder.
         It follows that in [10] above we distinguish just three categories, sequence of main clauses,
     finite subordination, and non-finite subordination. Within this last category, catenative31
   In languages where mood, tense, and aspect are marked inflectionally there is some tendency for an aspect
   marker to be closer to the lexical base than a tense marker, and for the latter to be closer than a mood marker;
   the English syntactic order matches that morphological order.
32
   The have of We have to stop and the like is not a member of the syntactic category of modal auxiliaries, and in
   particular is not defective. It is therefore not catered for by structure [20] – e.g. it can precede or follow the
   perfect (You have to have completed three years of undergraduate study; I have had to put it aside). Nevertheless,
   in some varieties it can be used as a core auxiliary (Ch. 3, §2.5.6), and there is no evident reason why it should
   then be treated differently from other core auxiliaries.
1220          Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clauses
             complementation, we find a considerable range of differences in the degree of internal inde-
             pendence between the two clauses, but there is no principled basis for drawing a distinction
             between two quite different constructions. The dependent-auxiliary analysis implies that the
             auxiliaries have come, over time, to be reanalysed so as to lose their status as verbs taking
             non-finite complements: what we have seen, however, is that they have retained too much
             syntactic independence for this thesis to be sustainable. We believe, moreover, that the pro-
             posed analysis is much more viable in a descriptive framework that recognises the catenative
             complement as a distinct kind of complement – there is no question of suggesting that the
             non-finite complements of the core auxiliaries are objects or predicative complements.","[1239, 1240]"

           In traditional grammar the term ‘final clause’ is used for the type of subordinate clause illustrated in [7–9]. In
           order, so (that), and so as are treated as subordinating conjunctions constituting part of the subordinate clause.
                                                                               § 12.2 Purpose     729
 (c) Ungoverned subjectless infinitivals with no other missing element
 [13] i He resigned to avoid any conflict of interest.
       ii They sent Sue to New York to manage the photography department.
     iii The meeting was adjourned by the Head of Department to provide time for
          consultation with course committees.
      iv The goods were sold at a loss to make room for new stock.
       v The new prison has no outside windows to make it more secure.
  The default case is illustrated in [i], where the matrix subject provides the antecedent for
  the missing subordinate subject. But in ungoverned clauses there are other possibilities. In
  [ii] the antecedent is matrix object: it is Sue who is to manage the photography depart-
  ment. The matrix clause in [iii] is passive; it can be interpreted with the complement of
  by, the Head of Department, as antecedent, but we can also take the whole matrix situa-
  tion as providing the interpretation. This reflects the fact that The Head of Department
  provided time for consultation by adjourning the meeting entails Adjourning the meeting
  provided time for consultation. There is no by phrase in [iv], but we can still interpret it
  with either the seller of the goods or the selling of the goods as making room for new
  stock. In [v] the matrix is active: it’s the design or building of the prison with no outside
  walls that was intended to make it more secure. These examples indicate that the missing
  subject in a purpose infinitival does not have to be syntactically controlled.
 (d) Ungoverned infinitivals with a missing non-subject
 [14] i I bought themi for the children to play with i .
      ii I bought themi to read i on the train.
     iii She gave me this boxi to put the loose change in i .
     iv They gave the flowersiˆ to Linda to present i to the soloist.
      v The flati was bought (by Ralph) to use i as a pied à terre in London.
  The subordinate clauses here are ‘hollow’ non-finites in the sense of Ch. 14, §6: the ‘ i ’
  marks the position of a missing object, of the verb or of a preposition, that is linked to
  the element in the matrix bearing the same index. This element is object of the matrix
  in [i–iv], subject in [v]. In [i] the infinitival has its own subject, but in the others the
  subject is missing too. The antecedent for the missing subordinate subject is marked by
  double underlining. This construction is found only with ungoverned infinitivals: we
  cannot insert in order or so as in these examples.
 Purpose infinitivals and unbounded dependency constructions
 [15] i Who have they gone to Paris to see this time?
      ii These are the kinds of student [that this school exists to cater for ].
  Non-subject elements in infinitival purpose adjuncts can be questioned or relativised, as
  in these examples, where it is the matrix clause, not the infinitival, that is interrogative
  or relative. This construction occurs most readily, but by no means exclusively, when the
  matrix clause expresses motion, as in [i].
 Infinitivals in clause and NP structure
 [16] i Two other books to read on holiday were lent to me by Fay.              [NP modifier]
      ii She lent me them to read on holiday.                                 [clause adjunct]
     iii She lent me two books to read on holiday.                               [ambiguous]
730      Chapter 8 The clause: adjuncts
        Infinitival clauses similar to the ones we have been considering are also found as modifier
        in the structure of NPs, as in [i]. The position of the clause here rules out an analysis as an
        adjunct in clause structure: it can only be part of the subject NP. In [ii] the infinitival must
        be an adjunct in clause structure because the pronoun them cannot take such dependents.
        Examples like [iii] can then be analysed in either way, but with little effective difference
        in meaning. As a clause adjunct it specifies her purpose in lending me two books, as an
        NP modifier it gives descriptive information about the books – “books which were for
        reading on holiday”.
       Implicit purpose
        We noted above that reason adjuncts often implicate purpose: for example, [6iia], He
        got up at 4.30 because his plane left at six, implicates that he got up then in order to catch
        the six o’clock plane. The same kind of implicature may be triggered by a conditional:
       [17] i If you want to catch the six o’clock plane, you will have to get up at 4.30.
            ii In order to catch the six o’clock plane, you will have to get up at 4.30.
          A purpose implicature is particularly common where it is a matter of avoiding some
       undesirable situation:
       [18] i Come in before you get wet.
            ii The children had to be watched carefully lest they stray with their new rubber
               surf-floats beyond the orange and yellow flags.
           iii Keep well away in case you get hurt.
           iv He delayed his departure for fear of missing something.
        The underlined adjuncts might be interpreted as “so that you don’t get wet”, “so that
        they wouldn’t stray . . . beyond the orange and yellow flags”, “so that you don’t get hurt”,
        “so that he wouldn’t miss anything”. But the prepositions that introduce them do not
        themselves mean “so that . . . not”: the purpose interpretation arises only if the content
        of the subordinate and matrix clauses is conducive to it. Compare the above with, for
        example:
       [19] i Come in before your father gets home.
            ii He trembled lest they should see through his disguise.
           iii Take your umbrella in case it rains.
           iv She was never game to join in for fear of being ridiculed.
        These clearly cannot be glossed in terms of “so that . . . not”, but there is no reason to say
        that the prepositions have a different meaning here than in [18]. Notice, moreover, that
        [19iii] still implicates purpose, but a purpose whose content is not so simply derivable
        from what is expressed: we understand something like “Take your umbrella in order to
        avoid getting wet if it rains”. Depending on the context, there could likewise be a purpose
        implicature in [19i]: “Come in before your father comes home in order to avoid possible
        unpleasant consequences if he comes home and finds that you are not yet in”.
       Purpose and deontic necessity
        Purpose adjuncts are commonly found with matrix clauses expressing deontic necessity,
        one special case being that where it is a matter of satisfying rules and regulations:
       [20] i Significantly more permanent positions will have to be created to fulfill the re-
               quirements of the day-to-day running of the museum from 1988.
            ii How many credit points are needed to obtain a degree?
                                                                                     § 12.3 Reason    731
  Scope and focus
   In negative clauses purpose adjuncts may have wider or narrower scope than the negative;
   in the latter case they can be the focus, as they can also be in alternative questions:
   [21] i He doesn’t eat much, to keep his weight down.               [adjunct has wider scope]
        ii I didn’t come here to have a quarrel.                     [negative has wider scope]
       iii Did you say that to please her or to annoy her?","[748, 749, 750, 751]"
"
7.1 Linear position of AdvPs in clause structure
 Front, end, and central positions
  We distinguish three main positions for adjuncts, as described in Ch. 8, §20.1. Front
  position is before the subject. End position is after the verb, and perhaps some or all of
  its dependents. Central position in clauses headed by a lexical verb is between the subject
  and the verb; for clauses headed by an auxiliary verb it can again be between subject and
  verb, but is more often just after the verb (and hence not always clearly distinct from end
  position). We illustrate in [2], where the adjunct happily can be either an evaluation or
  a manner adjunct:
  [2]                                                        semantic type      position
          i Happily, they watched TV until dinner.           evaluation         front
         ii They happily watched TV until dinner.            manner             central
        iii They watched TV happily until dinner.            manner             end
        iv They watched TV until dinner happily.             manner             end
  Placement in end position immediately after a lexical verb is possible when no object is
  present (They watched happily until dinner) but impossible in [2]: ∗They watched
  happily TV until dinner. The latter is excluded by the general prohibition against sepa-
  rating a head from an NP functioning as its object (except where heavy complements
  are postposed) – recall the discussion of ∗He doesn’t like enough the idea in §2.2).
     As noted in Ch. 8, §20.2, an adjunct immediately following a catenative auxiliary
  verb may belong either in the clause headed by the auxiliary or in the non-finite clause
  functioning as its complement. Compare:
  [3]    i I would frankly [want a lot more money than that for it].     [speech act-related]
        ii I would [frankly explain to him what the position was].                 [manner]
  Note then the different possibilities in [4] for placement of the modality adjunct probably,
  which belongs in the upper clause, and the manner adjunct contentedly, whose basic
  position is in the watch clause:
  [4]    i a. Probably they would watch TV for hours.        modality          front
           b. They probably would watch TV for hours.        modality          pre-auxiliary
           c. They would probably watch TV for hours.        modality          post-auxiliary
        ii a. ?Contentedly they would watch TV for hours.    manner            front
           b. ?They contentedly would watch TV for hours.    manner            pre-auxiliary
           c. They would contentedly watch TV for hours.     manner            post-auxiliary
           d. They would watch TV contentedly for hours.     manner            end
           e. They would watch TV for hours contentedly.     manner            end
 VP-oriented and clause-oriented AdvP adjuncts
  Modality probably is oriented towards the clause as a whole rather than more specifically
  to the VP, whereas it is the other way round with manner contentedly. This distinction can
  be generalised to the other semantic types discussed in Ch. 8, so that we will distinguish,
576    Chapter 6 Adjectives and adverbs
      for purposes of setting out the relevant generalisations about AdvP positioning, two
      significantly different groups of adjunct types:
      [5]       VP-oriented adjuncts
              i manner                   She walked unsteadily to the door.
             ii means or instrument      Planets can be detected radio-telescopically.
           iii act-related               They deliberately kept us waiting.

      [6]       clause-oriented adjuncts
              i domain                   Politically, the country is always turbulent.
             ii modality                 This is necessarily rather rare.

             v connective                Moreover, he didn’t even apologise.
         Only rather broad and approximate flexible generalisations about adjunct placement
      and sequence can be made. There is a great deal of variation in use, and features of
      context, style, prosody, and euphony play a role in some decisions. However, a useful
      rule of thumb can be framed in terms of the distinction between the adjunct types in [5]
      and those in [6]. The generalisation, in two parts, can be stated thus:
      [7]    i AdvPs realising VP-oriented adjuncts are more closely associated with the VP
               constituents, and more likely to be positioned in the VP or adjacent to the VP.
            ii AdvPs realising clause-oriented adjuncts are less closely associated with the VP
               constituents and less likely to be positioned in the VP or adjacent to the VP.
          The statement about positioning in [7i] correlates with a semantic observation,
      namely that VP-oriented adjuncts denote modifications of the details of the predicate
      of a clause: if the predication corresponds semantically to a type of action, adjuncts of
      these types tend to specify aspects such as the way in which the action was carried out,
      the time it took, the degree to which it was carried out, or the order in which it was done
      relative to other actions.
          There is also a semantic observation relevant to [7ii]. Clause-oriented adjuncts repre-
      sent modifications of the applicability of the clause content. That is, their semantic effect
      is to characterise how the propositional content of the clause relates to the world or the
      context: the sphere of discourse within which it holds (domain), the array of possible
      situations within which it is true (modality), the extent to which its obtaining is a good
      or a bad thing (evaluation), or the attitude the speaker has towards its obtaining (speech
      act-related). Clause-oriented adjuncts have meaning contributions that are much more
      external to the content of the proposition.
          Putting the syntactic and semantic observations together, we see that the closeness of
      the adjuncts in linear proximity to the predicator at the heart of a clause tends to correlate
      with the closeness of what the adjuncts express to the content of the predication.
                                               § 7.1 Linear position of AdvPs in clause structure   577
 Adjunct orientation and linear position
  The rough generalisation in [7] can be adapted to yield a more detailed guide to AdvP
  positioning if we note that front position is furthest from the VP, central position is
  closer, and end position means being in or adjacent to the VP. Clause-oriented adjuncts
  often favour front position; VP-oriented adjuncts favour end position. Central position
  before an auxiliary is a less common alternative to front position; and central position
  after an auxiliary may be found with either, since it is ambiguous with respect to clause
  or VP orientation.
     It follows from this that if a clause-oriented AdvP and a VP-oriented AdvP are both
  in central position, they will be in that order, or will acquire a different and perhaps
  unusual meaning if not in that order:
 [8]    i a. They had luckily already left.       b. ?They had already luckily left.
       ii a. It probably sometimes fails.         b. ?It sometimes probably fails.
  The [b] examples are not fully acceptable: [ib] has an aspectuality adjunct before an
  evaluation adjunct, and [iib] has a frequency adjunct before a modality adjunct; both
  illustrate clause-oriented adjuncts closer to the verb than VP-oriented ones.","[595, 596, 597]"
" General and language-particular definitions
  In criticising the traditional notional definitions, we assumed that they were intended to
  enable us to determine what expressions in English belong to the categories concerned.
  It must be emphasised, however, that most of the terms that figure in a grammatical
  description of English are not unique to English but appear in the grammars of other
  languages too – in some cases, in the grammars of all languages. There are therefore two
  issues to be considered in defining or explaining such terms. At one level there is the
  issue of what grammatical properties distinguish one category from another in English.
  We call this the language-particular level. This is the level we have been concerned with
  so far. A language-particular definition will enable us to decide which expressions in
  the language concerned belong to the category. At another level there is the issue of
  what principled basis we have for using the same grammatical terms in the grammars
  of different languages, given that the language-particular distinctive properties will vary
  from language to language. We call this the general level. The fact, for example, that the
  negative imperative Don’t be punctual requires auxiliary do while the negative declarative
  You aren’t punctual does not is clearly a specific fact about English: it belongs in the
  language-particular definition of imperative clause for English, but not in a general
  definition.
      It might then be suggested that the traditional notional definitions should be con-
  strued as applying at the general rather than the language-particular level. Certainly
  they are not intended to apply uniquely to English. But at the same time there can be
  no doubt that as they are presented in school textbooks, for example, they purport to
  be language-particular definitions: the student is meant to be able to apply them to
  decide whether a given word in English is a noun, whether a verb is in the preterite,
  whether a clause is imperative. In effect, the traditional definitions aim to work at both
  levels simultaneously, and our objection is that the levels need to be distinguished,
  and approached differently. At the language-particular level, as we have argued, it is
  necessary to focus on form: to specify the grammatical features that distinguish ex-
  pressions which belong to the category from those that do not. At the general level
  it is quite legitimate to invoke meaning: languages serve to express meaning, and it
32    Chapter 1 Preliminaries
     is rare to find grammatical distinctions that have no correlation at all with semantic
     distinctions.
         We need to make it clear when giving a general definition that it is to apply at
     the general level, not the language-particular. And we need to acknowledge that the
     correlation between grammatical form and meaning is typically complex rather than
     one-to-one. The general definitions we propose for the categories discussed above are
     as follows:
     [20] i noun:            a grammatically distinct category of lexemes of which the mor-
                             phologically most elementary members characteristically denote
                             types of physical objects (such as human beings, other biological
                             organisms, and natural or artificial inanimate objects)
           ii preterite:     a grammatically distinct inflectional form of the verb whose pri-
                             mary use is to locate the situation in past time (relative to the
                             time of utterance)
          iii imperative: a grammatically distinct clause construction whose members are
                             characteristically used to issue directives
     The move to an avowedly general definition, together with the reference to characteristic
     use of the most elementary members, enables us to avoid the vagueness of the term
     ‘thing’ (or ‘name’) in [16i]. The fact that such lexemes as rejection, arrival, idea do not
     denote physical objects is not a problem for a definition at this level. By virtue of the
     distinctive grammatical properties specified in the language-particular definition, these
     lexemes belong to the same category as girl, boy, daffodil, window, etc., and this category
     as a whole satisfies the general definition of noun because it contains lexemes like these
     last examples that do denote physical objects. Note that the abstract nouns rejection
     and arrival are morphologically derived from lexemes of another category (verb); mor-
     phologically elementary nouns, such as girl, boy, etc., characteristically denote kinds of
     physical object.
         Definition [20ii] allows for the fact that verb inflections often have more than one
     use. In [17ia] (The finals started yesterday), we have the past time use. In [17ib] (You
     said the finals started tomorrow) the preterite form started is within a subordinate clause
     functioning as complement to said: this is a case of what is traditionally called indirect
     reported speech. Your actual words will have been, say, The finals start tomorrow, but
     present tense start is shifted into the preterite started in my report. Another use of the
     preterite is seen in I wish the finals started tomorrow, where it indicates counterfactuality:
     we understand that the finals do not start tomorrow. Of these three uses, it is the one
     that indicates past time that is primary. The others are found only in special contexts,
     such as the complement of a preterite verb of reporting or the complement of wish. This
     verb-form therefore qualifies for the label preterite.
         Definition [20iii] likewise overcomes the problems we noted in [16iii]. The language-
     particular criteria assign Sleep well to the same category as Go to bed and Please open
     the door, and since most clauses with this form are normally used as directives we call
     the category imperative clause. Would you mind closing the door is excluded from the
     category at the language-particular level: it does not have the distinctive grammatical
     form of imperative clauses in English.
                                                    § 5 Semantics, pragmatics, and meaning relations                  33
     The grammatical distinctiveness requirement in general definitions
     It will be noted that the general definitions in [20] all impose a condition of grammatical
     distinctiveness. This requirement means that the general term being defined will be
     applicable in the grammar of a given language only if it can be given a distinct language-
     particular definition in that language.
         A significant weakness of traditional grammars of English is that they incorporate a
     number of categories that in fact have no place in a grammar of Present-day English,
     although they are perfectly valid for Latin (and in some cases older stages of English).
     A simple example is provided by the dative case inflection. A traditional dictionary or
     schoolbook definition is given in [21i], while our proposed revision is given in [ii]:
     [21] i dative:            the case of nouns, etc., expressing the indirect object or recipient
          ii dative:           a grammatically distinct case characteristically used to mark the
                               indirect object
     Definition [i] suggests that in He gave Caesar a sword, for example, Caesar is in the dative
     case, as it is in indirect object function and expresses the semantic role of recipient. And
     that indeed is the analysis found in many traditional grammars and school textbooks
     (especially older ones). But Present-day English has no dative case. In the Latin coun-
     terpart of the above sentence Caesar has a different form (Caesarı̄) from the one it has
     when functioning as subject (Caesar) or direct object (Caesarem), so the distinctiveness
     condition of definition [ii] is satisfied for Latin. In English it is not satisfied: the form is
     simply Caesar whether the function is subject, direct object, or indirect object. There is
     no noun, not even a pronoun, with a distinct inflectional form for the indirect object,
     and hence no basis at all for including dative among the inflectional categories of the
     English noun.15
5 Semantics, pragmatics, and meaning relations     Few grammars even attempt to describe the ways in which sentences are formed without
     making reference along the way to meaning and how sentences express it. After all, few
     would take it to be controversial that a human language such as English is in some sense
     a system for framing thoughts and making meaningful messages expressible, and this
     would make it a natural supposition that meaning and grammar would be to some extent
     intertwined. This grammar, while not attempting a full and detailed semantic description
     of the language (which would be an unrealistically large and difficult enterprise), touches
     on the topic of meaning frequently. But as we will explain, we do not treat meaning as a
     unitary phenomenon.","[51, 52, 53]"
" Practical bias towards written English
     Despite our neutrality between speech and writing in principle, there are at least three
     reasons why the reader may perceive something of a bias in this work towards data from 3
   The computer corpora that we have made use of are the Brown corpus of a million words of American English;
   the Lancaster/Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus of British English; the Australian Corpus of English (ACE); and the
   Wall Street Journal corpus distributed by the Association for Computational Linguistics. The British National
   Corpus (BNC) was only released to scholars working outside the UK after the book was in final draft. We have
   also drawn on a variety of other sources, including collections of our own from sources such as magazines,
   newspapers, plays, books, and film scripts.
 4
   Since our discussion of sentences will very often make reference to the way they are used we will have very
   frequent occasion to talk of speakers, and in order to avoid repeatedly using the term ‘speaker’ we will often
   simply use the 1st person pronoun I . Given that the book has joint authorship this pronoun could not be used
   in reference to any specific person, and hence is available as a convenient variant of ‘the speaker’.
12    Chapter 1 Preliminaries
     written English. To the extent that it is present, it stems from practical considerations
     rather than matters of principle. We will discuss here the three factors motivating the
     choices we have made.
     Citation of forms and examples
     First, we normally follow the usual practice in grammars of citing words or sentences
     in their written form. This is mainly a matter of practical convenience: it is much more
     straightforward typographically, and more widely accessible to readers, to supply exam-
     ples in this form. In certain cases – as, for example, in describing the inflectional forms
     of verbs and nouns in Ch. 18 – it is necessary to indicate the pronunciation, and for this
     purpose we use the system of transcription described in §3.1.2 below. Representations
     in written form are given in italics, while phonological representations are enclosed in
     obliques.
     Accessibility of print sources
     Second, we make frequent use of genuinely attested examples (often shortened or other-
     wise modified in ways not relevant to the point at issue), and it is significantly easier to
     obtain access to suitable large collections, or corpora, of written data in a conveniently
     archived and readily searchable form than it is for speech.
     Error rates in speech
     Third, and most importantly, it must be acknowledged that the error content of spoken
     material is higher than that of written material. Those who have listened to tape record-
     ings of spontaneous conversation are likely to have been struck by the high incidence of
     hesitation noises, false starts, self-corrections, repetitions, and other dysfluencies found
     in the speech of many people. It is not hard to see why speech contains a higher number
     of errors than writing. The rapid production of speech (quite often several words per
     second) leaves little time for reflection on construction choices or planning of sentence
     structure, so that at normal conversational pace slip-ups of the kind mentioned are very
     common. As a result, what speakers actually come out with reflects only imperfectly the
     system that defines the spoken version of the language. Hardly noticed by the listener,
     and often compensated for by virtually unconscious repair strategies on the part of the
     speaker, these sporadic interruptions and imperfections in speech production are inher-
     ently outside the purview of the grammarian (the discipline of psycholinguistics studies
     them in order to learn about the planning, production, and perception of speech). They
     therefore have to be screened out through judicious decision-making by a skilled na-
     tive speaker of the language before grammatical description is attempted. The original
     speaker is not always available for the tedious editing task, and so someone else has to
     interpret the transcript and remove the apparent errors, which means that misunder-
     standings can result (word sequences that were actually due to slips might be wrongly
     taken to represent grammatical facts).
         Written English has the advantage that its slow rate of composition has generally
     allowed time and opportunity for nearly all these slips and failures of execution to be
     screened out by the actual author of the sentence. This provides a practical reason for
     us to show a preference for it when selecting illustrative examples: we have very good
     reason to believe that what ultimately gets printed corresponds fairly closely to what the
     writer intended to say.
                                                § 3.1 The representation of English pronunciation        13
        The nature of the written medium and the slower sentence-planning environment
    permits the construction of longer sentences than typically occur in speech, but we take
    this to be a matter of degree, not a matter of written English instantiating new possibilities
    that are completely absent from the spoken language. The basic point of most written
    material is that people who are ordinary native speakers of the language should read it
    and understand it, so the pressure will always be in the direction of keeping it fairly close
    to the language in which (ignoring the speech errors referred to above) ordinary people
    talk to each other.","[31, 32, 33]"
" Class 2B: to-infinitival or gerund-participial
  Except where otherwise indicated, the simple construction has an ordinary subject and
  the plain-complex has a raised object.
  2 Bi: both form-types can be simple or complex; genitive allowed (I’d hate to see it; I’d
  hate you to see it ; I hate wasting time ; I hate his /him wasting time)
  [23]   can bear N            can stand N            hate2            like PP            loathe
         love                  prefer T
  The genitive version of the complex gerund-participial (He didn’t like my interrupting
  him) is generally restricted to formal style, and even there many would use only the
  non-genitive. None of these verbs allows passivisation: ∗He’d be hated to see it. Most verbs
  of liking and not liking belong in this class, but detest and for the most part dislike are
  restricted to the gerund-participial, and hence belong in Class 2 C. For the past-participial
  with like, see §5.6.2.
  2 Bii: both form-types can be simple or complex; no genitive (I need to read it ; I need
  you to read it; My hair needs cutting ; I need my hair cutting)
  [24]   deserve F?            need2                  require          want1
  The gerund-participials here are concealed passives. There can be no passivisation of the
  matrix, except with require in the to-infinitival: The form is required to be returned by 1
  May. The complex to-infinitival with deserve is somewhat marginal: ? He didn’t deserve
  for his request to be turned down.
  2 Biii: to-infinitival simple or complex, gerund-participial restricted to one or the
  other (I intend to tell /telling her ; I intended him to hear me)
  [25]   intend PX TM (F)      plan PX TW (F)         want2 –P PP
  With the first two the gerund-participial is permitted only in the simple construction,
  whereas with want 2 it is found only in the complex (for It wants washing is a concealed
  passive with want 1 “need”):
  [26] i a. I intended to read /reading it.                                           [simple]
          b. I intended you to read / ∗reading it.                                  [complex]
       ii a. I want them standing when the Minister enters.
          b. I don’t want you bringing your dog with you.
1232         Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clauses
            The gerund-participial with want 2 generally has a progressive interpretation, but in
            non-affirmative contexts it can be non-progressive. Example [iia] is equivalent to I want
            them to be standing when the Minister enters, contrasting with non-progressive I want
            them to stand when the Minister enters. But in [iib] the meaning is “to bring”, not “to be
            bringing”.
               In the complex to-infinitival intend takes a raised object, plan an ordinary one:
        [27] i I intended there to be more time for discussion.
             ii We planned the seminar to coincide with her visit.
            2 Biv: to-infinitival plain-complex, gerund-participial simple (He admits it to have been
            a mistake ; He admits breaking it)
        [28]        ackowledge TU             admit TU             confess TU           deny TU
            The simple construction has an ordinary subject, the complex one a raised object. These
            verbs belong semantically with the verbs of cognition/saying in Class 3 Aii, but differ
            syntactically in allowing a simple construction with a gerund-participial.
            2 Bv : to-infinitival plain-complex, gerund-participial simple or complex (I remember
            him to be irascible ; I remember telling you; I remember his/him telling you)
        [29]        advise NS TM              encourage NS         forget2 TU –P       recollect TU –P
                    recommend NS TM           remember2 TU         report TU PP
            Both genitive and non-genitive forms are permitted in the complex gerund-participial,
            with the genitive as usual more formal. In the simple construction, advise, encourage, and
            recommend have a non-syntactic interpretation of the missing subject, while the others
            have subject control. Compare :
        [30] i I wouldn’t recommend buying it.                                   [potential buyer unspecified]
             ii I remember buying it.                                                       [buyer = speaker]
        2C: gerund-participial only
            All verbs in this class allow a genitive subject in the gerund-participial. The non-finite
            complements here are relatively close to objects: except where marked ‘–PG ’ they can
            marginally be promoted to subject through passivisation (whereas the intervening NP
            never can). There are two subclasses to distinguish.
            2 Ci: simple construction has control by subject (You risk being arrested; I won’t risk
            them/their seeing us together)
        [31]         abhor            anticipate         appreciate             begrudge              can help N39

                                                                                                    ?
                     delay            describe           detest                 discuss               dislike

                     risk             tolerate           welcome       39
            Non-affirmative can help also occurs with but + bare infinitival: compare I couldn’t help overhearing /

1234         Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clauses
        The ‘B’ annotation for make applies only in the active: in the passive it takes a to-
        infinitival:
        [35] i They made us feel guilty.                            [active + bare infinitival]
             ii We were made to feel guilty.                         [passive + to-infinitival]
                This class contains a rather large number of verbs of cognition or saying, illustrated in
            [34i], and a handful of verbs of permission, ordering, and causation, listed in [34ii]. The
            verbs in [34i], except for informal tip, also occur with an unmodalised finite complement:
            I assumed that there was a mistake in the instructions.40 All allow perfect infinitivals
            (I assumed there to have been a mistake) and, in the absence of perfect marking, the time
            of the subordinate situation is the same as that of the matrix. This means that we cannot
            have, say, ∗I believe her to win tomorrow’s semi-final corresponding to finite I believe
            that she will win tomorrow’s semi-final. In the non-perfect the infinitival normally has a
            stative interpretation: be is especially common. Matrix passives are always possible and
            tend to be more frequent than actives; with say and others marked ‘+P’ passivisation is
            obligatory: He is said to be dying (not ∗They say him to be dying).
                Consider now the verbs of permission and ordering in [34ii] (we take up the causatives
            in the discussion of Class 3 Bi). Allow appears in examples like:
        [36] i Will you allow me to audit your course?
             ii We mustn’t allow there to be any repetition of this behaviour.
            iii The weather didn’t allow us to finish the game.
        Example [i] illustrates a conventional way of requesting permission, which might sug-
        gest an interpretation where me is an argument of allow, with the role of recipient of
        permission. In [ii], however, allow is clearly behaving like our model raising verb intend:
        there is certainly no question here of giving someone permission to do something. This
        is even clearer in [iii], where we have an inanimate subject. Allow has a much more
        general meaning than “give permission”, the core being something like “not prevent,
        make possible, enable”, and it would be difficult to maintain that the construction was
        ambiguous in such a way that in He allowed Kim to take all the credit for this achieve-
        ment, say, the object is raised (it’s fair to assume that Kim didn’t seek permission to
        take the credit) while in He allowed Kim to audit my course we have an ordinary ob-
        ject (with Kim seeking and receiving permission). For even where giving permission
        is apparently involved we still find equivalence between active and passive infinitival
        constructions:                                                                                            
        [37] i He allowed the postgraduates to audit the course.
                                                                                    [voice-neutral]
             ii He allowed the course to be audited by the postgraduates.
            The recipient of permission can be encoded with give permission, but even here it need
            not be, so that we have a contrast between He gave them permission to audit the course
            (recipient encoded) and He gave permission for them to audit the course (recipient not
            encoded). This contrast is not available with allow, which is best treated as a raising
            verb in all cases; it does not encode the giving of permission to anyone, though it       40
            It has been suggested that the finite and non-finite constructions are not entirely equivalent, that I believe
            him to be telling the truth, for example, is more acceptable than I believe him to be lying (by reason of being
            compatible with I believe him), but we are sceptical about the validity of a distinction along these lines.
                                                                                                    § 5.4 Class 3       1235
     may, in favourable circumstances, trigger an implicature that permission is given to the
     object-referent. Permit and let behave in essentially the same way. So indeed do the
     modals can and may in their deontic sense, except that here only one argument is
     encoded: the raised complement is thus subject, not object. You can come in now may
     be interpreted in context as “I give you permission to come in now”, but the giver and
     receiver of permission are not encoded as arguments of can.
         Order has a meaning comparable in specificity to give permission rather than al-
     low : it involves issuing some (normally verbal) order. But the object clearly doesn’t
     encode the recipient of the order in examples like He ordered the documents to be de-
     stroyed: this has a raised object and is equivalent to the finite construction He ordered
     that the documents be destroyed. Nevertheless, order differs from allow in that the cases
     where the object clearly does not represent the recipient of the order predominantly
     have passive infinitivals.41 Thus whereas we can say He ordered that the data be freely
     available to all interested parties, the infinitival #He ordered the data to be available to
     all interested parties is anomalous (since it requires us to take the data as recipient of
     the order).
         With a human object and active infinitival there is a strong implicature that the object
     represents the recipient, so that He ordered Kim to unlock the safe, say, is not equivalent
     to He ordered that Kim unlock the safe. Command is more straightforward in that it does
     not normally allow a raised object with a passive: #He commanded the documents to be
     destroyed.
     3 Aiii: oblique-complex (Kim appealed to them to release the hostages)
 [38]         appeal [to]       bank [on]        count [on]       depend [on]         keep on2 [at]       rely [on]
     These take a catenative complement only in combination with a prepositional comple-
     ment; in addition call uniquely occurs either in this construction or in the for-complex:
     cf. [9iia–b] of §3 (He called for Ed to be sacked ; He called on Ed to resign).
     Class 3 B: infinitival, gerund-participial, or past-participial
     Verbs in this class all take non-genitives in the gerund-participial. We distinguish two
     subclasses on the basis of matrix passivisation.
     3 Bi: no matrix passivisation (I got them to talk /talking; I got my car repaired )
 [39]         get4        have3 B
 These belong semantically with the verbs of causation, but occur in a wider range of
 constructions than the others, which are found in classes 3 Ai and 3 Aii: we consider them
 all together here. The distinction between ordinary and raised complements is seen
 in:
 [40] i They forced/compelled Kim to unlock the safe.                      [ordinary object]
       ii This caused both of us to overlook the inconsistency.               [raised object]
     Force and compel (3 Ai) impose selectional restrictions on the object and assign an agen-
     tive role to the covert subject of the infinitival: in [i] force/compulsion is applied directly41
     Not exclusively, however: cf. France has ordered nuclear testing to resume. Occasional examples of this kind are
     also found with instruct: I instructed prison routine to continue as normal.
1236    Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clauses
       to Kim and the verbs clearly belong with our model verb persuade. Cause and enable, on
       the other hand, belong equally clearly with the raising verbs (3 Aii): note, for example,
       the equivalence between [ii] and This caused the inconsistency to be overlooked by both
       of us; the second argument in [ii] is thus the whole event of our overlooking the incon-
       sistency, and there is no direct relation between the matrix verb and its object. Make, get,
       and have are less clear-cut. Make could substitute with little effect on the meaning both
       for force/compel in [i] and for cause in [ii]. It does not readily take a passive infinitival,
       but ? Pat made both candidates be interviewed by Kim seems to differ in propositional
       meaning as well as acceptability from Pat made Kim interview both candidates, suggest-
       ing that it takes an ordinary object, like force/compel. On the other hand, it can take
       a dummy object, certainly extrapositional it, as in He made it appear that he had been
       acting under duress, where it is difficult to see any direct relation between verb and object.
       Make thus seems to allow either control by object or raised construal, with a good deal
       of indeterminacy between the two. Get allows a wider range of objects than force/compel
       (cf. He finally got the car to start, where the car’s role is non-agentive), but it cannot
       take dummy there as object (cf. ∗He finally got there to be a reconciliation). As for voice,
       we have:
       [41] i He got a specialist to examine his son.
             ii He got his son to be examined by a specialist.
            iii He got his son examined by a specialist.
       Examples [i] and [ii] are not equivalent and get here clearly takes an ordinary ob-
       ject (as also with a gerund-participial). But [iii] is not an alternant of [ii]: get takes
       a raised object in the past-participial construction (which has no active counterpart).
       With have the analogue of [ii] is not acceptable (∗He had his son be examined by a spe-
       cialist), and we have equivalence between He had a specialist examine his son and He
       had his son examined by a specialist ; this indicates a raised object, which ties in with
       the fact that have is also used with a non-causative “undergo” sense: He had the police
       call round in the middle of the night to question him about his secretary’s disappear-
       ance, where the visit was something that happened to him rather than something he
       arranged – and where there would seem to be no direct semantic relation between verb
       and object.
       3 Bii: matrix passive allowed (I heard them arrive/arriving ; I heard the window broken)
       [42]    feel TU (B)      hear TU (B)       notice TU B      observe TU (B)       overhear (B)
               see1 TU (B)      watch B
       These verbs, together with smell from Class 3 Cii below, are the verbs of sensory per-
       ception. All take bare infinitivals, while those where the ‘B’ is parenthesised take a to-
       infinitival as well. For see we have the following possibilities:
       [43] i a. We saw Kim leave the bank.             b. ∗Kim was seen leave the bank.
            ii a. We saw Kim leaving the bank.          b. Kim was seen leaving the bank.
           iii a. We saw Spurs beaten by United.        b. ? Spurs were seen beaten by United.
           iv a. We saw him to be an impostor.          b. He was seen to be an impostor.
       We put the to-infinitival last because this does not represent the primary sense: it is not
       a matter of sensory perception but of mental inference. In this construction, see behaves
                                                                                              § 5.4 Class 3       1237
  like the verbs of cognition/saying (Class 3 Aii), following their pattern of favouring a
  matrix passive and the verb be in the subordinate clause, of allowing the perfect (He was
  seen to have altered the figures), and of alternating with the finite construction (We saw
  that he was an imposter).
      The primary sense, illustrated in [43i–iii], involves two arguments, an experiencer and
  a stimulus (the situation perceived): Kim in [i–ii] thus does not represent an argument of
  see. We demonstrated this for the gerund-participial construction in §3.2.2, but it holds
  for the other form-types too; this is why there is equivalence between [iiia] and We saw
  United beat Spurs.
      The gerund-participial in [43ii] has progressive meaning: in [i] we saw the whole
  event of Kim’s leaving the bank, in [ii] a segment of it – the contrast is the same as that
  between Kim left the bank and Kim was leaving the bank. The progressive auxiliary be
  cannot be used (∗We saw Kim be leaving the bank), and passive be is likewise omitted to
  give [iiia] instead of ∗We saw Spurs be beaten by United.42
      The bare infinitival does not allow matrix passivisation, as is evident from [43ib]. The
  to-infinitival, however, has a wider range of use in the passive than in the active:
  [44]      a. ∗We saw Kim to leave the bank.               b. Kim was seen to leave the bank.
  It is therefore tempting to see [44b] as filling the gap created by the ungrammaticality
  of [43ib] (parallel to the case with make: We made Kim leave the bank ; ∗Kim was made
  leave the bank; Kim was made to leave the bank). Yet it is doubtful if the sense is quite the
  same: [44b] has at least a trace of the cognitive component of meaning noted above for
  [43iv]. Compare, for example:
  [45] i They had seen him drive, so everyone decided to go by bus.
       ii He had been seen to drive, so everyone decided to go by bus.
  Notice that [i] is perfectly coherent, but [ii] is not. In [i] they had perceived the event,
  and hence the manner of his driving, and we infer that it was the latter that made them
  decide to go by bus. But in [ii] it is the fact of his driving that had been registered, and
  this doesn’t provide an obvious reason for them to go by bus.
      None of the other sense verbs shows quite the same range as see. The closest is feel but
  construction [43iii] is here virtually restricted to reflexives or body parts (I felt myself /
  my leg grabbed from behind ). With hear and overhear [iv] is virtually excluded in the
  active (∗We’d heard him to be an impostor) and in the passive we have again the problem
  of distinguishing between the senses of [i] and [iv]: we do not have ∗He was heard to be an
  impostor (where see would be quite normal), but only examples like He was heard to lock
  the door, which is very close to They heard him lock the door.43 Watch wholly excludes
  the to-infinitival, whether active or passive. Notice and observe are hardly possible in
  [iii], and notice is also marginal in [iv]. Smell is generally restricted to [ii], and hence is
  listed in Class 3 Cii below; it combines predominantly with burn (I can smell something
  burning).","[1251, 1252, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256, 1257]"
"       The order X–P–S
        In spite of the importance of position in marking the subject, it interacts with other
        factors. The order X–P–S is excluded where X is O, but not for other values of X.
        A non-object X can even occasionally take the form of an NP:
       [15] i A thorough rogue was James Bacharach.                                       [PC–P–S]
            ii The following morning came news of her father’s arrest.                     [A–P–S]
           iii ∗A loud explosion heard the children.                                       [O–P–S]
        The ban on O–P–S reflects the fact that NPs in S and O function can be of the same
        semantic type, so that the meaning of the NPs themselves may give no indication as to
        which is S and which O. In Kim admires Pat, for example, there is nothing but the order
        to tell us who is the admirer and who the admired. In [ii], by contrast, the initial NP is a
        time expression and can thus be interpreted as adjunct while the final NP can only be S,
        given that come is intransitive. In [i] the NPs differ in definiteness, and while the second
        is clearly referential the first can be interpreted as an ascriptive property term.",[264]
" Reordering and realignment
 The differences between information-packaging constructions and their more basic
 counterparts are in some cases simply a matter of the linear order of the syntactic
 elements, and in others a matter of how semantic elements are aligned with syntactic
 functions. Using process terminology with the interpretation just explained, we can
 say, then, that constructions [4i–iii] involve reordering, while the others all effect a
 realignment of semantic and syntactic elements.
    In [4i–iii] the non-canonical version can be regarded as less basic than its default
 counterpart in that the order is not only less frequent but subject to pragmatic con-
 straints that do not apply to the default version. In [iv–ix] the non-canonical version is
 syntactically less basic by virtue of its greater syntactic complexity: the realignment is
 accompanied by the addition of one or more elements, such as there in [iv], it in [v], the
 auxiliary be and the preposition by in [ix] and so on.",[1387]
"       Further remarks on infinitival clauses
           (a) Infinitivals with an overt subject
           Infinitivals governed by so + as cannot contain a subject: if a subject has to be expressed
           after so, the finite construction is required. Both infinitivals that are governed by in order
           and those that are ungoverned may have a subject preceded by the subordinator for,
           though this construction is much less common than the subjectless one:

                   in a low oven.
           (b) Governed infinitivals with no subject
           In subjectless clauses governed by in order or so as, the antecedent for the missing subject
           is the subject of the matrix clause:
       [12]         He resigned in order /so as to avoid any conflict of interest.",[748]
"        Oi and Od distinguished by order
            When both objects follow P (as in all canonical clauses) their relative order is fixed, with
            Oi preceding Od .23 If we switch the order of the two NPs we change their functions,
            yielding a clause with a quite different meaning or else an anomaly:
            [8]    i a. They offered all the overseas students one of the experienced tutors. [Oi –Od ]
                     b. They offered one of the experienced tutors all the overseas students. [Oi –Od ]
                  ii a. He gave Sue the key.                                                   [Oi –Od ]
                     b. #He gave the key Sue.                                              [anomalous]
            The effect of the switch is comparable to that of switching S and O NPs in a monotran-
            sitive: Ed saw Kim vs Kim saw Ed or Kim enjoyed the concert vs #The concert enjoyed Kim.
            In the ditransitive case, however, the switch almost always results in anomaly, because in
            the great majority of such clauses Oi is human (or at least animate) and Od inanimate,
            as in [iia].
                In constructions where an object occupies prenuclear position, Od –S–P–Oi (with the
            first post-verbal element being Oi , as in the canonical construction) is strongly preferred
            to Oi –S–P–Od :
            [9]          Od –S–P–Oi                                    Oi –S–P–Od
                    i a. The key he gave Sue.                       b. ?Sue he gave the key.
                   ii a. The key which he lent me didn’t fit        b. ?The one who(m) I lent the key didn’t
                         the lock.                                       return it.
                  iii a. He asked what I bought her.                b. ∗He asked who(m)I bought presents.
                  iv a. What a lot of hardship he caused            b. ∗What a lot of them he caused great
                         them!                                           hardship!
       23
            Some varieties of English, particularly BrE varieties, allow the order Od –Oi when both Os are personal
            pronouns, as in % He gave it her rather than the more widespread He gave her it.
                                                                                    § 4.3 Ditransitive clauses           249
  Speakers vary considerably in their judgements of the [b] examples, particularly of those
  where the corresponding prepositional construction has to, as in [ib/iib], rather than for,
  as in [iiib/ivb]. Nevertheless, there is very widespread agreement that the [b] examples
  are significantly less acceptable than the [a] ones.","[268, 269]"
" Ditransitive Oi and Od compared with monotransitive Od
  We have been assuming that the second object of a canonical ditransitive can be identified
  with the single object of a monotransitive (as Od ) while the first is a distinct type of object (Oi ).
  This is not entirely unproblematic, however, as is evident from the following examination
  of the properties of Oi and what for convenience we will refer to as ‘monotransitive Od ’ and
  ‘ditransitive Od ’.
  (a) Passives
  We have noted that the first passive (with the subject corresponding to Oi ) is preferred over
  the second (where the subject corresponds to ditransitive Od ). This makes Oi somewhat more
  like monotransitive Od than is ditransitive Od . However, the marginality of [10iib] shows that
  it by no means behaves like a prototypical monotransitive Od .
  (b) Post-verbal position
  It is of course Oi rather than ditransitive Od that characteristically occupies the position
  immediately following P, as in [10i]. It is, however, significantly more resistant to departures
  from this position than is monotransitive Od , as we see from the next two points.25
24
   Acceptability is greater when we have a personal pronoun + by phrase: This copy was given me by my grandfather.
25                    i
  Note also that O does not readily allow a particle to intervene between it and P: examples like I gave John
  back his sunglasses are more acceptable than ? I gave back John his sunglasses, an order that many speakers
  find unacceptable. The issue is complicated by the fact that the presence of a particle will often favour a PP
  complement over an Oi . Thus while He sent his students out a questionnaire may be more acceptable than ? He
  sent out his students a questionnaire, it is appreciably less so than He sent out a questionnaire to his students or
  He sent a questionnaire out to his students.
250         Chapter 4 The clause: complements           (c) Object postposing
           Unlike monotransitive Od and ditransitive Od , Oi cannot be postposed when heavy:
       [11] i He gave to charity everything he earned from the concert.      [monotransitive Od ]
            ii He gave Sue immediately all the spare keys he had had cut.       [ditransitive Od ]
               ∗
           iii He gave a second chance all those who had scored 40% or more.                 [Oi ]           The ban on S–P–Od –Oi is comparable to that on O–P–S. Order is the primary factor distin-
           guishing Oi from Od as well as S from O, and the grammar excludes structures which reverse
           the normal Oi –Od and S–P–O orders.
           (d) Prenuclear position
           As we have seen in [9], clauses with prenuclear Oi are of low acceptability, whereas di-
           transitive Od occurs as readily in this position as monotransitive Od – compare the [a]
           examples with The key he lost, The key which he tried didn’t fit, He asked who(m)I had invited,
           What a lot of them he had offended!
           (e) Predicand
           Unlike monotransitive Od and ditransitive Od , Oi cannot be the predicand for a predicative
           adjunct:
       [12] i She ate the steak almost raw.                                    [monotransitive Od as predicand]
            ii He served her her steak almost raw.                                [ditransitive Od as predicand]
           iii ∗He offered her the steak fiendishly hungry.                                    [Oi as predicand]
           In [i–ii] the property expressed by the adjunct almost raw is predicated of the steak, expressed
           as Od , but [iii] illustrates the impossibility of having Oi as predicand: it can’t mean that
           she was in a state of fiendish hunger as he offered her the steak (the asterisk applies to this
           interpretation: it is grammatical with the subject he as predicand).
           (f) Control
           In infinitival purpose clauses an O can be left unexpressed if it is recoverable from the
           superordinate clause O – which is said to ‘control’ the gap, or missing element. The controlling
           element can be monotransitive Od or ditransitive Od , but not Oi :
       [13] i He wanted it to spend on his children.                            [monotransitive Od as controller]
            ii She gave him it to spend on his children.                           [ditransitive Od as controller]
           iii ∗She sent him it to prove wrong.                                                 [Oi as controller]
           In [i–ii] we understand to spend on his children as “to spend it on his children”: there is
           a missing O (a gap marked by ‘ ’) recoverable from the Od it of want or give. But [iii],
           where the intended interpretation is “She sent him it to prove him wrong”, thus with Oi as
           controller, is ungrammatical. (The infinitivals here are ‘hollow clauses’: see Ch. 14, §6, for
           further discussion.)
           Conclusion
           On balance, ditransitive Od has greater syntactic affinity with monotransitive Od than
           does Oi , justifying our analysis of the canonical double-object construction as contain-
           ing Oi + Od .26 The most important distinctive property of Oi is (d), its resistance to front      26
           Some modern grammars take the opposite view, regarding the first internal complement as Od and the second
           as not an O at all. Languages with a ditransitive construction fall broadly into two types, one where the O
           which characteristically has a recipient role behaves syntactically like a monotransitive O, and one where it
                                                                 § 5 Predicatives and related elements               251
  position, for (e)–(f) involve fairly infrequent constructions and certainly don’t apply to all
  Od s.","[269, 270, 271]"

        Presentation of examples
      Italics are used for all expressions cited in orthography.
      Bold italics are used to emphasise that we are citing a lexeme in abstraction from any of
         its inflectional forms, as in ‘the verb go’ (p. 27).
      “Double quotation marks” enclose meanings, or propositions.
      Underlining (single or double) and square brackets serve to highlight part of an example.
      small capitals are used, where appropriate, to indicate focal stress: I DID tell you.
      Arrows mark intonation, with  representing a rising pitch,  a falling pitch, as in Is it a
         boy  or a girl ?
      The symbol ‘—’, as in ‘what Kim bought —’, represents a gap (p. 49).
      The symbol ‘·’ marks a morphological division within a word or a component part of a
         word, as in ‘work·er·s ’ or ‘the suffix ·s ’.
      Subscript indices, such as ‘i ’ or ‘j ’, mark pairs of items related as antecedent and anaphor
         (p. 49); thus in ‘Jilli said shei would help’, the pronoun she is to be interpreted as
         anaphoric to the antecedent Jill.

" Analysis of the sequences provided that, in order that, etc.
  One point that is sometimes made in support of grouping the P-class ‘subordinating con-
  junctions’ with that is that they are mutually exclusive with it: we can have before the meeting
  ended and that the meeting ended, but not ∗before that the meeting ended. This argument is
  undermined, however, by the fact that some of the items we have to consider do combine
  with that, i.e. take expandable rather than non-expandable clauses as complement. A few of
  these are illustrated in:
  [6] i I’ll do it [provided that you pay me].
        ii They went hungry [in order that their baby would have food].
      iii It looks like any other typewriter [except that it has phonetic symbols].
       iv He intends to exercise his constitutional right to sit on the court, [notwithstanding that
           the commission of inquiry has not yet made its report].
     The traditional account of such constructions is that the that belongs with the preceding
     item – so that provided that, in order that, except that, notwithstanding that, and so on,
     are complex ‘subordinating conjunctions’. This preserves a relation of mutual exclusiveness
     between what we are calling S-class and P-class ‘subordinating conjunctions’. But there is
     compelling evidence that the that in fact belongs in the content clause, i.e. that the immediate
     constituents are as shown in [7b], not [7a]:
  [7]         a. ∗complex head analysis                        b. simple head analysis
                  provided that + you pay me                      provided + that you pay me
        The most important point is that that can be repeated in coordination: provided [that you
     pay me and that I’m allowed to do it my way]. The first that must belong in the coordination,
29
     Traditional grammar also allows for gerund-participials to occur after certain ‘subordinating conjunctions’.
     This creates further problems for the distinction between ‘subordinating conjunctions’ and ‘prepositions’,
     with although living in London having an initial ‘subordinating conjunction’, despite living in London an initial
     ‘preposition’.
1014          Chapter 11 Content clauses and reported speech
             not with provided : the coordination here is between two expanded declaratives, two clauses
             introduced by that.
                A second point is that the that is usually omissible: we can equally have I’ll do it provided
             you pay me. Under analysis [7b] this is covered by the general rules for the omission of the
             subordinator that as described in §3.1; under analysis [7a] it has to be treated as a separate
             phenomenon.
                Thirdly, in order allows an infinitival complement, with or without a subject:
          [8]       i [in order] [that their baby have food]
                   ii [in order] [for their baby to have food]
                  iii [in order] [to save food for their baby]
             Traditional grammars commonly recognise two complex units here, in order that and in order
             to. But this doesn’t cater for [ii]. The relation between [ii] and [iii] is just like that between
             It is essential [for their baby to have food] and It is essential [to save food for their baby]. If
             an infinitival clause contains a subject it takes for as subordinator, and for is permitted only
             when there is a subject. It is clear, then, that the structural division in [ii–iii] is between in
             order and the infinitival clause, as shown by the bracketing. And similarly in [i] the structural
             division comes before that, not after it; that as a marker of a finite declarative contrasts with
             for as the marker of an infinitival one with subject–predicate form. Similarly, items such as
             notwithstanding, except, granted take either a content clause or an NP as complement:
          [9]       i notwithstanding [that the commission has not yet made its report]
                   ii notwithstanding [the delay in the publication of the commission’s report]
             We don’t want to say there are two items notwithstanding that and notwithstanding : there is
             just one item, the preposition notwithstanding, and that appears when the complement is a
             declarative clause but not, of course, when it is an NP.
                Once it is established that the that belongs in the content clause, it is quite clear that
             provided, in order, notwithstanding, and the like are syntactically quite different from that. They
             are not markers of clause subordination contrasting with that, but prepositions functioning
             as heads of phrases that may contain declarative content clauses as complement.","[1033, 1034]"
" Organisation of the chapter
     We deal first, in §§2–3, with those processes which (like back-formation) do not result
     in words of a distinct morphological structure. Next, §§4–5 are mainly devoted to com-
     pounding and derivation respectively. We have, however, departed from an organisation
     based purely on the type of process or resultant form in order to give greater weight to
     meaning. Thus §4 is almost completely limited to compounding involving noun, adjec-
     tive, and verb bases, while compound verbs beginning with such preposition bases as
     out, over, under, etc., are dealt with in §5, along with the derivatives, and in this latter
     section we group together affixes that have the same kind of meaning (such as those
     deriving diminutives, reversatives, and so on) or have the same syntactic effect (such
     as deriving adjectives from nouns or verbs). It is hoped that the heterogeneity of the
     classification, in reflecting the heterogeneity of the material, will allow some patterns to
     emerge more clearly than they would with a classification based entirely on processes or
     one based entirely on meaning.
         We will not be concerned with the borrowing of new words from other languages
     (as with blitzkrieg, from German, for example): although this enlarges the vocabulary, it
     does not involve forming a new word. Nor will we be concerned with the development
     of new meanings for existing words. Most attention will be given to processes that are
     still productive.",[1651]
" Postposing of NPs representing discourse-new information
  Leaving aside the object + particle construction, where object postposing applies very
  freely, postposed NPs tend to be both heavy and discourse-new. Heavy NPs are likely
  to be discourse-new since entities that have already been referred to can generally be
  evoked a second time with few words, but as we noted in §2 there is only an imperfect
  correlation between weight and discourse-familiarity status. And in the present context
  we need to note that discourse-new status may be sufficient to motivate postposing when
  the NP concerned is not heavy:
 [5]      Jenkins walked back into the office and glanced out of the window. Turning around,
          he saw on the desk a gun.
1384      Chapter 16 Information packaging
         A gun is not heavy (and in relative terms the locative PP on the desk is slightly heav-
         ier than the object), but in terms of information status a gun is discourse-new while
         a desk is discourse-old (by virtue of the prior mention of the office and the salient
         relation between desks and offices). It is this difference in information status that
         motivates the postposing. Postposing of this kind is less frequent than that moti-
         vated by weight. Whereas the default order version he saw a gun on the desk is quite
         neutral, the version with a postposed object emphasises the unexpectedness of
         the gun.","[1403, 1404]"
"      Serial order
                                                                     √
      [19] i last            serial order                ∗ I ? had   eaten √ the previous day ∗
                                                                          √
           ii next           serial order                ∗ ‘Salome’ ? was   performed √ in 1926 ?
      The serial order adverbs again, first, last, and next generally resist front position quite
      strongly, and must precede the temporal adjuncts with which they frequently occur.
      Front position is not impossible for the word next in [ii], but the sentence Next ‘Salome’
      was performed in 1926 would be interpreted with next as a simple temporal location
      adjunct (“What happened after that was that ‘Salome’ was performed in 1926”), not with
      the reading where next has the serial order sense (“The next time ‘Salome’ was performed
      was in 1926”).",[600]
"
4.2 Object and extraposed object
   Comparable to the distinction between subject and extraposed subject is that between
   object and extraposed object:
   [5]    i It was necessary to postpone the meeting.        [subject + extraposed subject]
         ii We thought it necessary to postpone the meeting.   [object + extraposed object]
   We have seen that in examples like [i] it is the NP it, not the subordinate clause to postpone
   the meeting, that has the distinctive subject properties, and in [ii] it is again it, not the
   subordinate clause, that functions as object. It in [ii] occupies the post-verbal object
   position, and corresponds to the subject of a related passive: It was thought necessary to
   postpone the meeting, not ∗To postpone the meeting was thought it necessary. We therefore
   refer to the subordinate clause to postpone the meeting in [ii] as an extraposed object,
   again with the understanding that this is not a kind of object. It is semantically like an
   object, but does not fill that position syntactically. Note that while [i] has an alternant
   in which the subordinate clause does function as subject (To postpone the meeting was
   necessary) the extraposed clause in [ii] cannot replace the it (∗We thought to postpone the
   meeting necessary).
       Extraposed objects usually occur in complex-transitive clauses, as in [5ii], where it is
   object and necessary predicative complement. But it is not limited to this construction,
   as is evident from such examples as [6] (see Ch. 11, §4.3).
   [6]      I put it to you that you knew what the consequences would be.
248          Chapter 4 The clause: complements
      4.3 Ditransitive clauses
        Alternation with prepositional construction
            Most ditransitive clauses have alternants with a single object and a PP complement with
            to or for as head:
            [7]         ditransitive: S–P–Oi –Od                monotransitive: S–P–Od –C
                   i a. I sent Sue a copy.                   b. I sent a copy to Sue.
                  ii a. I ordered Sue a copy.                b. I ordered a copy for Sue.
            As the above formulation makes clear, it is only the [a] examples that we analyse as
            ditransitive, as double-object constructions. In [b] the PP to/for Sue is not an indirect
            object, not an object at all, having none of the properties outlined in §4.1 above, and the
            NP Sue is of course an oblique, hence not a possible object of the verb.","[267, 268]"
"       3
           Clauses like I promise to return the key and I order you to leave are ambiguous, having also less salient
           interpretations in which they are statements about my habitual behaviour (“I habitually promise to return
           the key / order you to leave”): in this interpretation they are not performatives since they do not themselves
           constitute a promise or order. The tomorrow in [2iia] makes the habitual reading even less salient, but it is
           still possible in principle.
                                                                     § 3.2 Indirect speech acts     861
  Propositional and non-propositional components of meaning
   The propositional content of a sentence is that part of its meaning that determines
   what propositions it can be used to express; clause type, however, contributes to non-
   propositional meaning (see Ch. 1, §5.2). Consider the relation between a declarative
   and its closed interrogative counterpart, as in:
   [6]         declarative                         closed interrogative
          i a. Kim is in Paris.                 b. Is Kim in Paris?
         ii a. Pat saw them.                    b. Did Pat see them?
   In each pair, [a] and [b] are partly alike and partly different in both form and meaning. In
   form, the closed interrogative contains the same elements as the declarative (sometimes
   with the addition of do, as in [ii]) but with a different order of subject and verb. As for
   meaning, what they have in common is that they have the same propositional content:
   both express the proposition “Kim is in Paris” or “Pat saw them”. They differ in the
   non-propositional component, more specifically, in their illocutionary meaning. In a
   normal use of [a] the proposition is asserted, whereas in [b] it is questioned. In both
   [i] and [ii] the illocutionary force is separate from the propositional content of the
   utterance: when I use [ia] to make a statement I do not express the proposition that I
   am making a statement – I simply make it by uttering a declarative with the appropriate
   intention. Similarly, when I ask a question by means of [ib] I do not say that I am asking
   a question. Note, then, that the term ‘express’ is neutral as to illocutionary force. And
   the terms ‘true’ and ‘false’ can be applied to propositions or to statements, but not of
   course to questions.
       A unique feature of performatives like [1], I promise to return the key tomorrow, is that
   here the (primary) illocutionary force is identified in the propositional content of the
   utterance. Thus [1] itself, for example, expresses the proposition “I promise to return
   the key tomorrow”. As a result of this feature of performatives, the primary illocutionary
   force of the utterance is more explicit and precisely specified in such utterances than it
   normally is elsewhere.
   Other non-propositional markers of illocutionary force
   Clause type and the performative use of illocutionary verbs are not the only linguistic
   devices for indicating illocutionary force. Intonation plays an important role too, as we
   shall see, and there are also particular words, such as please, which serve this purpose. But
   these further devices are like clause type in that they do not contribute to the propositional
   content of the utterance. When I say, for example, I’d like a cup of tea, please, the please
   serves to indicate that I am making a request, that I am asking for a cup of tea, but I do
   not express the proposition that I am doing so. Please is quite irrelevant to the truth or
   falsity of the utterance, and hence does not express any part of its propositional content.","[880, 881]"
"          Purposives          [19] i Extraordinary precautions were taken [so that no stranger be allowed in the city].
               ii He issued white gloves [so that his customers should not soil their hands].
              iii A true friend would change subjects [so that they could do projects together].
              iv They say I am urging him to abdicate [in order that I may step into his shoes].
           Subjunctives and specialised should are found with both so and in order, but they are
           not common. So usually takes an ordinary declarative, very often containing the can of
           ability, as in [iii]. The combination of purpose and ability can might perhaps be regarded
                                             § 7.1.3 Content clauses as exhaustive conditional adjuncts                        1001
       as a case of modal harmony: there is a close connection between purpose and enabling.
       In order is more formal than so, and this is reflected in the fact that the most frequent
       pattern with in order has may (or might), as in [iv]. This use of may is somewhat different
       from its use in main clauses, and hence counts as a specialised-modal construction. The
       main clause I may step into his shoes would most likely be interpreted epistemically
       (“I will perhaps ...”), and a deontic reading is also available (“I’m allowed to . . .”), but a
       dynamic, ability, reading is hardly possible.237.1.3 Content clauses functioning as exhaustive conditional adjunct
       The subjunctive is found in the exhaustive conditional construction discussed in §5.3.6:
    [20] i It meets with continuing hostility from those who see themselves as fostering and
            guarding serious art, [whether it be in the theatre, in fiction, or on television].
         ii Achieving the optimum blast design for a particular rock mass type, [be it in mining
            or quarrying,] can be an expensive and time-consuming procedure.
        iii They realise that East–West friction, [wherever it take place around the globe], is in
            essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies.
       In [i] we have a closed interrogative expressing an alternative question: the meaning is
       approximately “irrespective of the answer to the question ‘Is it in the theatre, in fiction, or
       on television?’”. The subjunctive here is relatively formal and more or less confined to the
       verb be, so that we find whether he likes it or not but hardly ?whether he like it or not. Example
       [ii] is an alternant of the construction with whether, again belonging to formal style. Here
       the restriction to the verb be is absolute, and the following subject is usually a personal
       pronoun. The structural relation between whether it be and be it bears some resemblance
       to that between whether it is and is it (as found in main clause interrogatives), but the
       subjunctive be + subject order is not a case of normal subject–auxiliary inversion, which
       applies only with primary verb-forms. Example [iii] is an open interrogative, with the
       subjunctive much less common than a tensed construction (wherever it takes place . . . ).24
           Specialised should is hardly possible as an alternant of the subjunctive in such con-
       ditionals, but one commonly finds may in the open interrogative type, in what can be
       regarded as a case of modal harmony:
    [21]      [Whatever one may choose to call it,] natural law is a functioning generality with a
              certain objective existence.
       This is equivalent to whatever one chooses to call it : may doesn’t add a new modal
       meaning, but reinforces that inherent in the whatever.","[1020, 1021]"
"26
     The term ‘verb group’ is an ad hoc one: if the main verb is head and the auxiliaries dependents, it would
     more properly be called a ‘verb phrase’. The ad hoc term reflects our view that the category is not theoretically
     justified but may have some practical descriptive value. We prefer, therefore, to reserve the term ‘verb phrase’
     for the unit which includes the complements and modifiers of the verb, in accordance with widespread usage
     in modern grammars. Traditional grammar generally uses the term ‘verb’ itself for the VGp as well as for the
     individual words within it, but it is undesirable to lose the distinction between the word and the larger unit.
1214            Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clauses
                  The auxiliaries are optional elements, but their order is rigidly fixed. A simplified
               structure of the VGp (ignoring do, use, and the have of I have to go) is shown in [20],
               where parentheses indicate optionality:
           [20]         (Modal)        (Perfect)       (Progressive)        (Passive)       Main Verb
                        will           have            be                   be              take
                        can                                                                 write
                        etc.                                                                etc.
               Such a structure accounts neatly for the possible combinations of auxiliary verbs and their
               relative order. Note, for example, that we have She has been reading (perfect + progressive),
               not ∗She is having read (progressive + perfect). The fixed order of the modals and perfect
               have similarly handles such data as the following:
           [21] i I may have mentioned it yesterday.                                                         [internal perfect]
                ii I should have mentioned it yesterday.                                                     [external perfect]
               iii Kim needn’t have written it.                                                                  [ambiguous]
               In [i] the past time expressed by have is associated not with the modality, but with the
               proposition that the modality applies to, thus “It is possible that I mentioned it yesterday”
               (cf. Ch. 3. §9.9). In [ii], by contrast, the modality – which here involves the concept of the
               ‘right’ thing to do – falls within the semantic scope of have, for it is a matter of what was
               right in the past: “the right thing to do was (or would have been) to mention it yesterday”.
               Example [iii] is ambiguous, for it can be interpreted in either way. The more salient reading
               follows the pattern of [ii]: “There was no need for Kim to write it yesterday” (with need
               inside the semantic scope of have); but it has a second interpretation along the lines of [i]: “It
               isn’t necessarily the case that Kim wrote it” (with need now outside the scope of have). The
               phenomenon is similar to that involving negative scope illustrated in [17] – where You must
               not start yet is interpreted differently from You may not start yet. The development of a VGp
               unit with a rigidly ordered syntactic structure results in certain semantic scope distinctions
               being left implicit. The VGp selects as a whole for negative polarity and perfect tense, and the
               markers of these categories occupy a fixed syntactic position within the structure irrespective
               of their semantic scope.27       4.2.2 The catenative-auxiliary analysis
               Although the category of VGp is in many ways descriptively very useful, the position
               taken here is that there are nevertheless compelling grounds for preferring an analysis
               of the modal, tense, aspectual and voice auxiliaries as catenative verbs taking non-
               finite complementation. On this account, [10iii–iv], Ed asked to read the report and Ed
               had read the report, have essentially the same structure. We will argue that there is no
               principled basis for drawing a structural distinction between catenative + complement
               and dependent-auxiliary + main-verb constructions.","[1233, 1234]"

Index
The index is divided into two parts, lexical and conceptual; in addition, there are two
specialised indexes given in the main text of the book, one covering the classification
of catenative verbs (Ch. 14, pp. 1239–40), one the inflection of verbs with simple bases
(Ch. 18, pp. 1608–9).
    In the lexical index we have in general cited lexemes (but in ordinary italics) rather
than the separate inflectional forms, unless there are syntactic reasons for mentioning
the latter. Thus there are no entries for took or children, which are covered under take and
child respectively, in references to Ch. 18 (pp. 1567–1619). However, participial adjectives
(such as distressing or worried) are listed. The number of lexical items mentioned in
Ch. 19 is too large to permit them all to be included. For derivatives quoted in §5 of
this chapter we have largely confined ourselves to listing the affixes; words ending in
·able, for example, will be found in the references for that heading. Similarly we have
listed combining forms rather than the neo-classical compounds containing them. Other
compounds cited only in the numbered displays in §4 (pp. 1644–66) are likewise not
included in the index.
    Idioms and comparable expressions, such as cross swords with and at the behest of,
are located in the alphabetical listing on the basis of the head word (cross, at). As will
be clear from the discussion in the text, the listing of expressions of this kind does not
imply that they form syntactic constituents.
    Cross-references are indicated by means of an arrow, interpreted as “see” or “see
also”. They are very largely confined to the conceptual index: there is, for example,
no cross-reference from conceptual ‘universal determinative’ to lexical ‘all ’ and ‘both’.
Since all and both are the two universal determinatives, such a cross-reference would
be entirely predictable; in cases of this kind, however, there are likely to be significantly
more references under the lexical heads than under the conceptual ones.
    Major references (typically the topic of a chapter, section or subsection) are marked in
bold face, and similarly major headings in the conceptual index are printed in bold face.
The annotation ‘n’ indicates that the reference is to a footnote; it is not used if the topic
is mentioned in the main text of the page concerned as well as in a footnote. References
of the type ‘742–5’ indicate that the item in question is dealt with on each page within
the span, whether it is a matter of a single discussion or of independent mentions.

         a. She took off the label.          b. She jumped [off the wall].
     In [a] off is a particle, an intransitive preposition functioning as complement of the
     verb, with the label a separate complement of the verb – more specifically, the label is
     object. In [b], by contrast, off is a transitive preposition with the wall as its object, so that
     off the wall is a PP forming a single complement of the verb. The constructions differ
     syntactically in the following ways:
     (a) The ‘particle + NP’ order can usually be reversed, ‘preposition + NP’ cannot
  [27] i a. She took off the label.                       b. She jumped off the wall.
       ii a. She took the label off.                      b. ∗She jumped the wall off.
     The distinctive property of particles is that they can precede the object, but in general they
     don’t have to, so that we have alternation between the two clause structures illustrated in
     [ia] and [iia]. In [ib], however, off the wall forms a single clause element, and the order
     within this phrase is fixed.
        Important though it is, this test is not as straightforward as (b) below: there are a
     small number of alternations between transitive PPs and sequences of NP + intransitive
     preposition (illustrated in [33] below), and also cases where a particle cannot be shifted
     around the object (§6.3.1).
     (b) Only a transitive preposition can be followed by an unstressed personal pronoun
     The NP following a transitive preposition (its object) can have the form of an unstressed
     personal pronoun, but the NP following a particle can’t: objects of this kind must im-
     mediately follow the governing verb.
  [28]       a. ∗She took off it.                         b. She jumped off it.
     This provides the simplest test for determining which structure we have in a given
     instance: if the NP can be replaced by an unstressed personal pronoun, it must be the
     transitive prepositional construction.4847
   The list could be expanded by adding various nautical terms such as aft, aloft, ashore, astern. There are others
   largely restricted to one or two verbs: leave behind.
48
   The qualification ‘unstressed’ allows for a particle to precede a pronoun bearing contrastive stress. In the
   context of removing people from a list, for example, with Jill mentioned as a possibility for removal, I might
   conceivably say: I’m certainly not going to take off HER.
282     Chapter 4 The clause: complements
       (c) Transitive PPs can normally be fronted/foregrounded,
       particle + NP sequences cannot
       In fairly formal style a transitive preposition can be fronted along with its comple-
       ment in such constructions as relatives and open interrogatives, and similarly transitive
       preposition + NP can be the foregrounded element in the it-cleft construction; a parti-
       cle + NP sequence, by contrast, does not form a constituent and cannot be fronted or
       foregrounded in this way:
       [29] i a. ∗the label [off which she took]          b. the wall [off which she jumped]
            ii a. ∗Off which label did she take?          b. Off which wall did she jump?
           iii a. ∗It was off this label that she took.   b. It was off this wall that she jumped.
       This test provides a sufficient but not a necessary condition for the transitive PP con-
       struction: we noted in §6.1.1 that some prepositional verbs select transitive prepositions
       that are fixed in position (see [12] above).
       (d) A transitive preposition can normally be repeated
       in coordination of phrases
       [30]      a. ∗Did she take off the red label or    b. Did she jump off the wall or
                     off the yellow one?                     off the balcony?
       Example [b] is well formed because the underlined sequences in Did she jump off the wall?
       and Did she jump off the balcony? are constituents. Conversely, [a] is deviant because in
       Did she take off the red label? and Did she take off the yellow one? the sequences off + NP
       are not constituents.
       (e) A manner adverb can generally be inserted between
       verb and transitive preposition
       [31]      a. ∗She took carefully off the label.    b. She jumped fearlessly off the wall.
       In [b] the complement of the verb is a PP and complements of this kind can be
       separated from the verb by such adjuncts as manner adverbs (except with the fixed
       specified prepositions). In [a], however, the label is object of the verb and cannot be
       separated from the verb in this way: [a] is comparable to ∗She removed carefully the
       label.","[301, 302]"
"        Beyond, through: meta·, trans·
         The “beyond” meaning is associated with a number of forms already discussed: over·,
         super·, out·, and also ultra· (covered under the augmentatives, but cf. also ultra-violet).
             Meta· is a combining form (as is evident from such compounds as metaphor or
         metazoa) with a number of different meanings. In anatomical and zoological terms
         it commonly indicates “at the back, behind, beyond”: metathorax, metacarpal. It may
         indicate change (of condition, etc.), as in metamorphosis. One clearly productive use is
         in the names of sciences such as metabiology, metachemistry, metapsychology: the subject
                                                                           § 5.5 Negatives and reversatives             1687
       matter here goes beyond, transcends, that covered in the basic science.42 A compound of
       particular relevance to this book is metalanguage, “a second-order language, a language
       used to talk about (a) language”.
          The prefix trans· carries the spatial meaning “beyond” or “across” in transatlantic,
       transalpine, translunary, transcontinental. In a few cases the meaning is “through”, as in
       transpierce. Like Greek meta·, it may indicate change: compare Latin-based transforma-
       tion with the above metamorphosis.","[1706, 1707]"
"      Dimensions of contrast between canonical and non-canonical constructions
       The examples in [1] illustrate five major dimensions of contrast between canonical and
       non-canonical clauses. In each case the canonical clause is syntactically more basic or
       elementary than the non-canonical one.
           The examples in [1i] differ in polarity, with [a] positive and [b] negative. In this
       example, the negative differs from the positive not just by virtue of the negative marker
       not but also by the addition of the semantically empty auxiliary do.
           The contrast in [1ii] is one of clause type, with [a] declarative and [b] interrogative.
       The syntactic difference in this particular pair concerns the relative order of subject and
       predicator: in [a] the subject occupies its basic or default position before the predicator,
       while in [b] the order is inverted. In the pair She finished the work and Did she finish the
       work? the interrogative differs from the declarative both in the order of elements and
       in the addition of the auxiliary do. All canonical clauses are declarative; non-canonical
       clauses on this dimension also include exclamatives (What a shambles it was!) and im-
       peratives (Sit down).
           In [1iii], canonical [a] is active while [b] is passive. These clauses differ strikingly in
       their syntactic form, but their meanings are very similar: there is a sense in which they
       represent different ways of saying the same thing. More precisely, they have the same
       propositional content, but differ in the way the information is presented – or ‘packaged’.
       The passive is one of a number of non-canonical constructions on this dimension. Others
       include preposing (e.g. Most of them we rejected, contrasting with canonical We rejected
       most of them), the existential construction (e.g. There were several doctors on board,
       contrasting with Several doctors were on board ), and the it-cleft (e.g. It was Pat who spoke
       first, contrasting with Pat spoke first).
           The underlined clause in [1ivb] is subordinate, whereas [a] is a main clause. In this
       example, the non-canonical clause is distinguished simply by the presence of the sub-
       ordinator that, but many kinds of subordinate clause differ from main clauses more
                                                   § 2 Canonical and non-canonical clauses         47
 radically, as for example in This tool is very easy to use, where the subordinate clause
 consists of just the VP subordinator to together with the predicator, with both subject
 and object left unexpressed. The clause in which a subordinate clause is embedded is
 called the matrix clause – in [ivb], for example, subordinate that Liz was ill is embedded
 within the matrix clause He said that Liz was ill. Subordination is recursive, i.e. repeatable,
 so that one matrix clause may be embedded within a larger one, as in I think he said that
 Liz was ill.
    Finally, the underlined clause in [1vb] is coordinate, in contrast to non-coordinate
 [a]; it is marked as such by the coordinator or. A greater departure from canonical
 structure is seen in Jill works in Paris, and her husband in Bonn, where the predicator
 works is missing.
    It is of course possible for non-canonical constructions to combine, as in:
 [2]     I can’t understand why I have not been questioned by the police.
 The underlined clause here is negative, interrogative, passive, and subordinate. But these
 are independent properties, and we can describe the structure in terms of its difference
 from canonical clause structure on four separate dimensions.","[66, 67]"

12.2 Purpose
   Realisation
    (a) PPs with clausal complements – finite clauses or infinitivals
    The prepositions found here are in order (finite or infinitival), so (finite), so as
    (infinitival):
   [7]     i May I request a postponement in order that I might make adequate preparation?
          ii He withdrew the remark in order to appease his colleagues.
         iii Please phone everybody before the meeting so that we can be sure of a quorum.
         iv He phoned everybody before the meeting so as to be sure of a quorum.
    In the finite construction, the subordinator that is readily omissible after so, but hardly
    after in order, which is somewhat more formal and considerably less frequent. The finite
    construction usually contains a modal auxiliary, such as might in [i], can in [iii]; clauses
    without modals are certainly possible, however, especially in the negative, and we also
    find examples of the subjunctive construction with in order:
728         Chapter 8 The clause: adjuncts
       [8]        i We think we have to fight in order that Cuba is integrated into the Latin American
                    system.
                 ii I’ll try and get home a little earlier than usual so we don’t have to rush.
                iii The administration had to show resolve in order that he not be considered a
                    lame-duck president.
       (b) Ungoverned clauses: infinitivals or finites with may/might
       [9] i We left early to miss the rush-hour.
            ii He requested an adjournment that he might have adequate time to study the
               documents.
           Here the subordinate clause functions as purpose adjunct itself, rather than being gov-
           erned by a preposition. Example [i] illustrates the most frequent type of purpose adjunct,
           while [ii] by contrast is very rare and formal: instead of the content clause that we have
           here, we would usually have a PP headed by in order or so.21 Ungoverned infinitivals are
           always positive: a negative requires a governing preposition. In He modified the story
           somewhat in order not to offend his parents, for example, we cannot omit in order.
       (c) PPs with NP complements
       [10] i I did it for fun /for your sake /for her benefit.
            ii He called in Kim [with a view to /with the intention of obtaining some professional
               advice].
           Example [i] illustrates the purposive use of for, while the construction in [ii] depends
           for its purposive meaning on the lexical content of the head noun, and the noun purpose
           itself could of course substitute for intention.","[747, 748]"

     4.3 Morphology, inflectional and lexical
        A grammar, we have said, is divided into two major components, syntax and mor-
        phology. This division follows from the special status of the word as a basic linguistic
        unit, with syntax dealing with the combination of words to make sentences, and mor-
        phology with the form of words themselves. In some respects the formation of words
        is comparable to the formation of larger units, but in others it is significantly differ-
        ent, and it is these differences that motivate dividing the grammar into two separate
        components.
                                                                   § 4.3 Morphology, inflectional and lexical                   27
 Words, lexemes, and inflection
     The term ‘word’, as used in traditional grammar, has two rather different senses. We can
     approach the difference by asking how many distinct words there are in, for example:
     [14]     You are working hard, but your sister is working even harder.
     It is clear that the third and ninth words are not distinct: they are tokens (instances) of the
     same word. But what about hard and harder: are these the same word or different words?
     The answer depends on what you mean by ‘word’. In one sense they are obviously
     different: harder has a suffix that is missing from hard. This enables it to occur in
     constructions like that of Your sister works harder than you, where it could not be replaced
     by hard; and conversely hard could not be replaced by harder in Your sister works very
     hard. So from a syntactic point of view they are different words. But there’s another
     sense in which they are traditionally said to be ‘different forms of the same word’. The
     perspective this time is that of the dictionary, which would have just one entry, labelled
     hard. The same applies to are and is in [14]: syntactically these are different words, but
     lexically (i.e. as far as the dictionary is concerned) they are the same. In order to avoid
     possible misunderstanding we will restrict the term word to the syntactically-oriented
     sense, so that hard and harder are different words, and likewise are and is. For the more
     abstract, lexically-oriented sense we will use the term lexeme. Hard and harder are then
     forms of the same lexeme, as are are and is.
         In many cases it makes no difference whether we take a syntactic or a lexical perspec-
     tive. Lexemes such as the and and are invariable, i.e. there is only one word corresponding
     to each. Also invariable are lexemes like efficiently: although more efficiently is in some
     respects like harder, it is not a single word, but a sequence of two, and hence efficiently
     and more efficiently are not forms of a single lexeme. Variable lexemes, by contrast, are
     those which have two or more forms. Where we need to make clear that we are con-
     sidering an item as a lexeme, not a word, we will represent it in bold italics. Hard, for
     example, represents the lexeme which has hard and harder – and also hardest – as its
     forms.13 Similarly are and is, along with be, been, being, etc., are forms of the lexeme
     be. In example [14], then, we have two occurrences of the lexeme hard, but only one of
     the word hard, and of course just one of the word harder. A variable lexeme is thus a
     word-sized lexical item considered in abstraction from grammatical properties that vary
     depending on the syntactic construction in which it appears.
         The variation found in variable lexemes is known, more specifically, as inflection,
     and the various forms are called inflectional forms of the lexeme. For the most part,
     inflectional categories apply to large sets of lexemes. Almost all verb lexemes, for example,
     inflect for tense (e.g. preterite took vs present tense take), most nouns inflect for number
     (e.g. singular dog vs plural dogs), many adjectives one or two syllables in length inflect for
     grade (e.g. plain old vs comparative older vs superlative oldest). The inflectional contrast
     of nominative case vs accusative case (e.g. we vs us), however, applies to just a handful
     of pronoun lexemes.","[46, 47]"
" Imperatives
 [7]     i Imperatives are normally restricted to main clauses.
        ii A 2nd person subject is omissible.
       iii The verb is in the plain form.
       iv In verbal negation, emphatic polarity, and code, supportive do is required even
           in combination with be.
        v Verbal negatives with you as subject usually have the order don’t + you.
 The examples in [8] show how these properties distinguish imperatives from
 declaratives:
 [8]        declarative                   imperative
       i a. You look after yourself.   b. (You) look after yourself.
      ii a. You are very tactful.      b. Be very tactful.
     iii a. Everybody stands up.       b. Everybody stand up.
     iv a. You aren’t late.            b. Don’t be late.
      v a. You don’t worry about it.   b. Don’t you worry about it.
 You look after yourself is ambiguous between declarative and imperative (it could be
 used as a statement about your behaviour or as a directive), but Look after yourself is
 unambiguously imperative (having only the directive interpretation). Examples [8ii–iii]
 have a difference in verb-form. Present tense are in [iia] contrasts with plain form be: be
 is the only verb lexeme that does not have syncretism between the plain form and one
 of the present tense forms. The difference in [iii] is of greater generality: here the plain
 form of the imperative contrasts with the 3rd person singular present tense form of
 the declarative, whatever the lexeme involved. In [8iv] do isn’t needed in the declarative
 because be is an auxiliary verb, but it is nevertheless required in the imperative (cf. ∗Be
 not late). Finally, in [8v] we have a difference in the position of the subject. Example
 [va] has the default S–P order; it is a statement, one that might well be followed by
 the question tag do you? In imperative [vb], a directive, the subject follows don’t.
858       Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
       Closed and open interrogatives: subclasses of a larger class
         or distinct primary classes?
         The terms ‘closed interrogative’ and ‘open interrogative’ suggest that they are subclasses
         of ‘interrogative’. Yet what they have in common is much more a matter of meaning
         than of syntax: they both characteristically express questions. From a syntactic point of
         view, they are in fact strikingly different. The most important property of open interrog-
         atives is the presence of an interrogative phrase, based on the special set of interrogative
         words – they can in fact be reduced to just an interrogative phrase, as seen in [4v]. The
         distinctive property of closed interrogatives (in main clauses) is subject–auxiliary inversion.
         Inversion is found in the open interrogative as well as the closed, but only as a secondary
         feature, triggered by the fronting of a non-subject interrogative phrase. As a result, closed
         Did she win the race? and Who won the race? share no syntactic feature distinguishing them
         from declarative She won the race. Note, moreover, that inversion is also found as a sec-
         ondary feature in a variety of other constructions too, such as negatives like Not once did she
         smile.
             It is for these reasons that we have treated closed and open interrogatives as each on a
         par with declarative, exclamative, and imperative within the syntactic system of clause type. It
         would not be helpful, however, to coin new terms for them without a shared component – and
         we will make use of ‘interrogative’ as a cover term, generally when the focus is on the relation
         with question rather than on the syntactic structure.","[877, 878]"
"        Range of parenthesised elements
            [1]       i Amazingly, only about 500,000 legal immigrants entered the US in the whole of the
                        1930s. (In those days there was little illegal immigration.)
                     ii Southern liberals (there are a good many) often exhibit blithe insouciance.
                   iii But listening to his early recordings (which have just been re-issued by Angel), one
                        has the impression of an artist who has not yet found his voice.
                    iv If your doctor bulk bills (that is, sends the bill directly to the Government) you will
                        not have to pay anything.
                     v It seems that (not surprisingly) she rejected his offer.
                    vi The discussion is lost in a tangle of digressions and (pseudo-) philosophical
                        pronunciamentos.
                   vii Any file(s) checked out must be approved by the librarian.
                  viii One answer might be that only different (sequences of) pitch directions count as
                        different tones with respect to the inventory.
            A very great range of expressions can be parenthesised. In [i] we have a sentence – and
            indeed it could be a sequence of sentences or a whole paragraph. In [ii] we have a
            main clause (it could not be punctuated as a sentence), and in [iii] a subordinate clause
            (a supplementary relative). The parenthesised element in [iv–v] is a phrase (VP and
            AdvP respectively), in [vi] a combining form, and in [vii] an inflectional suffix. Finally,
            [viii] shows that it need not be a grammatical constituent: sequences is head of the NP
            sequences of pitch directions, while of is the first word of the complement PP.
               In all these examples except [ii], the parenthesised element is integrable in the sense
            that the parentheses could be omitted or (as in [iii–v]) replaced by commas (at the left
            or both left and right boundaries).17 With the non-integrable type the status of the
            parenthesised element cannot be changed in this way. Where it is medial within the
            containing clause, the parentheses could only be replaced by dashes, which would make       15
          We use this term in preference to ‘parenthetical’ since the latter term is not tied specifically to written expressions
          marked off by parentheses; in this book we use it, more specifically, for expressions like she said, it seems, and
          so on, which are characteristically delimited by commas (see Ch. 10, §5.3). Besides the primary use that is
          our concern in this section, parentheses have a number of more specialised, secondary uses. One is to enclose
          numerals or letters used to order items in a list, as in Our three chief weapons are: (a) fear; (b) surprise; and
          (c) ruthless efficiency. In this use it is possible to omit the left parenthesis. A further use is to enclose dates in
          certain styles of bibliographic reference: This point was first made by Jespersen (1924).
       16
          The only systematic exception to this generalisation is that when the indefinite article precedes a parenthesised
          element its form (as a or an) depends on the properties of the first word within the parentheses: She made
          an (interminable) movie about a (supposedly endangered) owl. The choice between a and an is made on a
          phonological basis (see Ch. 18, §6.4), and always on the basis of the sentence as it would sound if read aloud
          with the parenthesised element included.
       17
          In the case of [1vi] the word-space before philosphical would drop with the parentheses.
                                                                                               § 4 Parentheses          1749
     hardly any change to its informational status; where it is final, a colon or semicolon could
     be used to separate it from what precedes. The non-integrable type characteristically has
     the form of a main clause; we also find sequences like that in:
 [2]          The facts of her background include a beloved older brother who was institution-
              alised in his early twenties for ‘dementia praecox’ (schizophrenia, probably) and
              died there some ten years later.
     This consists of an NP followed by a modal adjunct, and if the order were reversed it
     would be integrable.","[1768, 1769]"

5.2 The central deictic use
      The primary use of the demonstratives is in NPs referring to objects present in the situa-
      tion of utterance, with this applying to objects relatively close to the speaker (proximal),
      and that to objects relatively distant from the speaker (distal):
      [5]     i This apple looks riper than that one.
             ii Is this yours?
            iii What’s that you’re eating?
      If the demonstrative NP contains a postmodifier that itself participates in the proximal
      vs distal distinction, demonstrative and postmodifier must agree: this book here, those
      flowers over there, but not ∗this book there.
          What counts as proximal and what as distal is not determined by purely objective
      features of spatial location: there may be a subjective element involved. For example, I
      might be holding something in my hand and still have a choice between saying What is
      this? and What is that? In this context this would be the default choice, but that could
      be used to indicate some negative attitude such as disapproval. Or suppose we are in a
      department store looking for a jacket: I might refer to one quite close to me, saying How
      about this one? or How about that one? One possible factor in the choice could be whether
      I am the one wanting to buy (favouring this) or whether you are (favouring that).
          Demonstratives can be used deictically not only to pick out physical objects in the
      situation of utterance, but also in reference to properties of such objects or to actions
      taking place or other abstract features of the situation of utterance:
      [6]    i I hadn’t expected there to be this much damage. I’ve never seen a computer
               this small before. I’m not comfortable like this. Hold your head up like this.
               This is what he was doing. When we first travelled with Matthew he was
               younger than this.
            ii Stop that. I’m looking for something about that size. Don’t look at me like
               that / that way. That is not how to do it.
      As observed in §1, deictic demonstratives are often accompanied by indexing acts such
      as pointing – as in the last example of [i], where the speaker points at the child whose 27
      The ascriptive be construction is permitted under certain circumstances with an NP as predicative complement:
      That is an extraordinarily tall man over there; This is a beautiful baby.
1506       Chapter 17 Deixis and anaphora
          age is compared with Matthew’s. For the use of this in temporal deixis (as in this week,
          etc.), see §10.1.2 below.
             Demonstratives are also commonly found in discourse deixis (see [26] of §1):
         [7]     i A: You look about fifteen. B: Is that meant to be a compliment?
                ii I hope this conversation isn’t being recorded.
               iii Taking the Waltz first, a group of figures that really must be included are Natural
                   Turn, Closed Change, and Reverse Turn, danced in that order.
          In [i] that refers to A’s statement; in [ii] this conversation refers to the one in which the
          utterance of this conversation takes place; and in [iii] that order refers to the order in
          which the three figures have just been mentioned.","[1525, 1526]"
"
3.3 Focus complement preposing
   We turn now to cases where the preposed complement is focused:
   [26] i I made a lot of sweetbreads. [A couple of POUNDS I think I made for her.]
        ii I had two really good friends. [DAMON and JIMMY their names were.]
       iii I promised my father – [on Christmas EVE it was] – to write home at my first
           opportunity.
       iv A: Did you want tea? B: [COFFEE I ordered.]
   In focus complement preposing the preposed constituent serves both as a link with the
   prior discourse and as the value of the variable in the discourse-old open proposition
   expressed by the rest of the clause. In [i] the open proposition is “I think I made x
   amount of sweetbreads for her”, and a couple of pounds gives the value of x. Whenever a
   discourse involves mention of a relevant yet unspecified quantity (of time, space, objects,
1382      Chapter 16 Information packaging
         people, etc.), the focus in a clause with focus preposing may provide a specification of the
         quantity in question. The open proposition in [ii] is “Their names were x”, where x stands
         for members of the set of names. The link Damon and Jimmy together with the preceding
         mention of two really good friends evokes this set. Examples of focus preposing with the
         verbs name or call are extremely common; apparently the mere mention of a new object
         or entity renders salient the proposition that the entity is called something. The open
         proposition in [iii], roughly “It happened at x time”, is salient given the fact that events
         occur at particular times. Finally, [iv] illustrates the case where the link contrasts with a
         constituent in the prior discourse: tea and coffee are members of the set of drinks on the
         menu; “I ordered x” is inferrable from A’s question, and the focus provides a correction
         to the specification of the value of x.","[1401, 1402]"
"        Reanalysis of for as subordinator
         The item for that appears with to-infinitivals differs in important ways from the one
         that takes NP complements. Although traditional grammars and dictionaries classify it
         as a preposition, there are strong grounds for analysing it as a subordinator, with the
         following NP functioning as subject of the infinitival VP. The subordinator for does for
         infinitival clauses with subjects what the subordinator that does for finite content clauses.         (a) Occurrence of to-infinitivals in non-PP positions
         In spite of the similarities illustrated in [36], for clauses commonly appear in places that do
         not allow for PPs:
        [38] i For you to give up now would be tragic.                                          [subject]
             ii It’s rare for the bus to be so late.                                 [extraposed subject]
            iii This made it necessary for the meeting to be postponed.               [extraposed object]
            iv I can’t afford for them to see me like this.                       [complement of afford]
         Most importantly, they occur as subject or as extraposed subject/object, as in [i–iii]: PPs do not
         appear in extraposed position and appear as subject only under highly restrictive conditions.
         In addition, [iv] shows that the class of verbs taking for clause complements is not limited to
         those allowing for PPs: while [iv] is grammatical, ∗I can’t afford for an investigation is not (cf.
         also agree and say).
         (b) Range of subject NPs
         Except for the matter of accusative case, the NPs following for are the same as those which
         occur as subject of finite main clauses. Note in particular that dummy there occurs freely
                                                                         § 1.4.2 The infinitival subordinator to             1183
        here though it can’t occur as complement in a for PP, and the same applies to numerous NPs
        that form parts of idioms:
    [39] i It’s essential for there to be no misunderstanding on this point.
         ii He called for close tabs to be kept on the new recruits.
        (c) Constituent structure
        It is clear that for + NP + VP forms a constituent – the subject of [38i], for example, is
        uncontroversially for you to give up now, and similarly for the other examples cited.8 Within
        this sequence there is no reason to say that the NP combines directly with for ; rather the NP
        and VP combine to form a clause nucleus showing the same range of contrasts as a main
        clause – or as a clause nucleus following the subordinator that :
    [40] i It’s necessary [for both your parents to sign the form].
         ii It’s necessary [for the form to be signed by both your parents].
        iii It’s necessary [for your parents both to sign the form].
        The underlined clauses in [i] and [ii] contrast as active vs passive, while that in [iii] contrasts
        with [i] with respect to the position of both: the NP following for behaves like an ordinary
        clause subject.
        (d) Absolute initial position and contrast with that
        For must occupy initial position in the subordinate clause. We have noted that it can’t occur
        in the interrogative and wh relative constructions [22]: this is because the initial position is
        there pre-empted by the interrogative subordinator whether and the interrogative and relative
        phrases. Its syntactic role is therefore closely parallel to that of the finite clause subordinator
        that, which is likewise excluded from interrogative and wh relative constructions. Like that,
        for has no identifiable meaning of its own, but serves as a syntactic marker of a particular
        syntactic construction. The functional similarity to that is particularly clear in such pairs as
        the following, where we find a direct contrast between finite and infinitival clauses:
    [41] i a. It is important that detailed records be kept.
            b. It is important for detailed records to be kept.
         ii a. That’s the best course that you can take.
            b.That’s the best course for you to take.
        iii a. In order that the bill may be passed major amendments were made.
            b. In order for the bill to be passed major amendments were made.","[1202, 1203]"
" With NP as first internal complement: You told me that you would help [13] i assure                        convince                  inform                 notify                persuade
         reassure                     remind                     satisfy               tell                  thank

      ii advise                       ask                       beg                    caution               command

         teach                        warn
     With the verbs in [i] the NP is normally obligatory.6 With the verbs in [ii] it is optional
     and those marked ‘? ’ (all of them mandative) occur much more readily without the NP
     object. It is the NP that corresponds to the subject of related passives, so that passives
     with the content clause as extraposed subject are restricted to constructions where the
     NP is omitted:
 [14] i We have been shown that the program is defective.
      ii It has been shown that the program is defective.
     iii ∗It has been shown us that the program is defective.
 As complement to the verb be [15] i The reason he resigned was that he didn’t get on with the boss.
      ii What she said was that she’d be contacting us later in the day.
     iii The fact/problem/rumour is he can’t afford the rent.
 5
   Wonder allows passives in such modal contexts as Can it be wondered that he feels insecure?, but not normally
   in non-modal contexts like ∗It is wondered that he feels insecure. For worry we have I worry that he may have left
   it too late, but not ∗It is worried that he may have left it too late ; I’m worried that he may have left it too late is
   perfectly acceptable, but this is not a passive clause since worried is here an adjective.
 6
   The NP object is omissible when informal how is the subordinator: He told how he’d had to sleep in the carport.
   Thank appears in this construction with a limited range of objects, as in I thank my good fortune I wasn’t at
   home at the time – with others the second complement is a for phrase (I thank you for being so patient).
960            Chapter 11 Content clauses and reported speech
              Examples [i–ii] are straightforward instances of the specifying use of be described in Ch. 4,
              §5.5; the content clause identifies the value of the variable expressed in the subject.7 Ex-
              ample [iii] can be spoken with two intonation groups, the first ending with stressed is,
              in which case it is hardly possible to have that in the content clause. Although the subject
              NP contains the definite article, there is no reference to any previously mentioned or
              independently definable fact, problem, or rumour. The effect here is to present the con-
              tent clause as new information, rather than to specify the value of a variable – and in this
              interpretation it is certainly not possible to reverse the order of the elements related by be.","[979, 980]"
" Ordering constraints
     Under the dependent-auxiliary analysis the fixed ordering of the auxiliaries is catered for by
     stipulating that the VGp has the structure shown in [20]. Under the catenative analysis the
     order results from certain independently needed constraints.31
     (a) Initial position of the modals
     This is attributable to their defective morphology: they have no secondary forms and so can’t
     appear in the non-finite complement of another verb.32
     (b) Final position of passive be
     This is due to the fact that it is the following verb that is passivised: the preceding auxiliaries –
     the modals, have, and progressive be – don’t have objects and are outside the scope of the
     voice contrast. Compare now:
  [36] i The king appears to be hated by his subjects.
       ii The king may be hated by his subjects.
     Be occupies second position among the verbs in [ii] for the same reason as in [i]: may, like
     appear, is outside the scope of the passive.
     (c) Fixed order of perfect and progressive
     Be can’t precede have because of a more general constraint excluding perfect have from the
     complements of aspectual verbs:
  [37] i ∗He was having read the book.
       ii ∗He began having read the book.
      iii ∗He stopped having read the book.",[1239]
"     The first syntactic argument that the internal complements in [10i] are objects is that we
     cannot replace them by AdjPs or bare role NPs – cf. ∗This proposal represents intimidatory ; ∗She
     constituted/provided treasurer. Secondly, the provide example in [10i] has a straightforward
     passive counterpart: An excellent example of a woman who has achieved outstanding success in
30
     The verb strike is exceptional in having S as predicand in a transitive construction: compare I regard him as a
     liability (normal, O as predicand) and He strikes me as a liability (exceptional, S as predicand). The behaviour
     of strike here correlates with its exceptional alignment of semantic roles and syntactic functions. Like regard
     it belongs to the field of cognition, yet it aligns experiencer and stimulus with O and S respectively, instead
     of the usual S and O (cf. §2.3), and this exceptional alignment in turn reflects the fact that the sense involved
     here is a secondary one relative to that of He struck me on the chin.
256    Chapter 4 The clause: complements
      the world of business while bringing up a large family is provided by Sue Brown. The relevant
      uses of constitute and represent do not so readily occur in the passive, but the underlined
      part of the following attested example shows that passives are not excluded with these verbs,
      merely less frequent:
      [11]   It would be possible to take sport in general, or indeed one particular sport such as cricket,
             and explain the material and ideological conditions surrounding its production in a
             specific socio-cultural order such as that constituted by Australia.
      Note, moreover, that the range of complementation patterns for provide is the same as in
      other uses, so that the above bivalent constructions can be matched with trivalent Sue Brown
      provides us with an excellent example . . . and The government provides us with the necessary
      funds.
          The semantic similarity between the objects in [10i] and predicative complements is re-
      flected in the fact that the former tend to match the subject in number. Compare [ib], for
      example, with Sue Brown and her sister provide excellent examples . . . or [ic] with These propos-
      als both represent serious threats to our standard of living. The fact that such number matching
      is found with objects that are semantically similar to predicatives provides further support
      for the view advanced above that it is a matter of semantic compatibility, not grammatical
      agreement.","[275, 276]"
" Three uses of the subjunctive in content clauses
  The three main subordinate constructions where the subjunctive is found are illustrated
  in:
  [1] i We insist that she be kept informed.
       ii Nothing in English has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use of words, unless
          it be the ambiguous use of sentences.
      iii Our thanks are due to all our staff, whether they be in the offices, the warehouses, or
          the branches, for their help during this difficult time.
  The content clause in [i] belongs to the subjunctive mandative construction; in [ii] it
  is complement to one of a small set of prepositions (if, unless, lest, etc.) that can take
  subjunctive complements; and [iii] is an exhaustive conditional interrogative.
994      Chapter 11 Content clauses and reported speech
       Alternatives to the subjunctive construction
        In none of the above three cases is the subjunctive construction obligatory. Two other
        possibilities have to be considered, as in the [b/c] examples in:
       [2]    i a. It is essential [that everyone attend the meeting].
                b. It is essential [that everyone attends the meeting].
                c. It is essential [that everyone should attend the meeting].
             ii a. They must co-operate in order [that the system operate effectively.]
                b. They must co-operate in order [that the system operates effectively.]
                c. They must co-operate in order [that the system may operate effectively.]
        The [b] examples are ordinary declaratives, while [ic/iic] belong to what we call the
        specialised-modal construction. This involves a use of a modal auxiliary that cannot
        be identified with one of the uses characteristic of main clauses. The should of [ic],
        for example, is not the same as that seen in the main clause Everyone should attend the
        meeting : the latter does not accurately express the content of our demand since the should
        here is weaker than in [ic], allowing that not everyone will necessarily attend. Similarly
        the may of [iic] is not interpreted like that of the main clause The system may operate
        effectively, where it conveys epistemic possibility. The ordinary declarative contains a
        present tense or preterite non-modal verb or else a modal auxiliary with a sense that
        it can also have in a main clause: compare, for example, subjunctive It is essential that
        everyone be able to see the screen with ordinary declarative It is essential that everyone is
        able to / can see the screen.","[1013, 1014]"
"      71
           In a similar way, the dummy pronoun there takes on the agreement properties of the displaced subject: see
           Ch. 4, §3.2.2.
                                                                 § 18.2 Semantically motivated overrides               501
       Examples [i–iv] – from a letter to shareholders from the chairperson of a major British
       company, a newspaper, government instructions relating to academic grant applications,
       a formal notice in a credit union office – are unquestionably ungrammatical, but exam-
       ples of this kind are not uncommon, even in written texts. They clearly involve processing
       errors: the subjects are relatively complex, and the verb has been made to agree with a
       plural NP within the subject rather than with the singular subject NP itself. The position
       of the plural NP immediately before the verb has presumably given it greater salience for
       the writer at the time of choosing the verb than the singular NP containing it. In the case
       of [i] and [iv], and perhaps [ii] also, the selection of the plural NP as agreement source is
       facilitated by the fact that it could substitute for the larger subject NP with little change
       to the meaning: The Directors believe that the above resolutions are in the best interests of
       the Company, and so on.
           This phenomenon is often described in terms of the concept of ‘proximity’: the verb
       agrees with the proximate preceding NP. The proximate preceding NP is the one whose
       head is closest to the verb: in [7i] the NPs the effect of the above resolutions and the above
       resolutions both immediately precede the verb, but the second is the proximate one since
       its head resolutions is closer to the verb than effect, the head of the first. English clearly has
       no general rule saying that the verb agrees with the proximate preceding NP (which is
       why we have starred these examples), but we will see that there are places where proximity
       is a relevant factor in more acceptable departures from simple agreement – and indeed
       one such case is seen in [vi].
           Example [7v], from a textbook by an eminent linguist, is more acceptable than [i–iv],
       but still cannot be covered by any established rule of grammar. The underlined verb is in a
       relative clause whose subject has singular kind as antecedent, so the simple agreement rule
       would predict is rather than are. The latter form matches the plurality of the sequence
       variations of word-order and grammatical structure, and again the sentence could be
       reformulated with this as antecedent for the relative clause: to control and interpret
       the kind of variations of word-order and grammatical structure that are exemplified in the
       sentences cited above.
           Examples [7vi–vii] are fully acceptable and grammatical: they illustrate cases where
       more specific rules require or permit the general rule of simple agreement to be over-
       ridden. We will survey a variety of such override constructions in §§18.2–3, and in §18.4
       we look at the interaction between coordination and agreement.72
18.2 Semantically motivated overrides with collective
     and number-transparent nouns
       Two of the most common overrides of the simple agreement rule are found with singular
       collective nouns and with the number-transparent quantificational noun construction
       introduced in §3.3 above:
   [8]          singular collective as head of subject NP
              i The committee has not yet come to a decision.                              [simple agreement]
             ii The committee have not yet come to a decision.                                [plural override]  72
       Examples like More than one glass was broken and One more application has been received than we had expected
       ([6] of §11) follow the simple agreement rule and hence do not need to be dealt with here: what is noteworthy
       about such examples is the mismatch between the syntactic number of the subject NP and its meaning.

           With collectives the override applies only in the case where the subject has a singular noun
           as head: with a plural head we have a plural verb in accordance with the simple agreement
           rule (The committees have not yet completed their reports). The number-transparent
           construction has overrides of both types: in [9i] we have a singular head (number) but a
           plural verb, while in [9ii] we have a plural head (heaps) but a singular verb. We consider
           the collective and number-transparent constructions together in this section because the
           plural override in [9i] is similar to that in [8ii] – and the division between collective and
           number-transparent nouns is by no means sharply drawn.","[520, 521, 522]"

 6.3 Verbal idioms containing intransitive prepositions
6.3.1 Lexicalisation and fossilisation
     The intransitive prepositions that are found in verbal idioms are ones which in free
     combinations have locative meanings: in, out, up, down, etc. In free combinations it is
     usually possible to add further locative specification:
    [34] i I jumped off (the wall).     I fell in (the dam).      I climbed down (the tree).
         ii I ran ahead (of him).       I got out (of the box).   I jumped down (from the wall).
     In [i] the optional elements are NPs (so that off, in, and down will be transitive preposi-
     tions when the NPs are present). In [ii] they are PPs.
        Such specification may be omitted because it is recoverable anaphorically, from pre-
     vious mention: She climbed onto the wall and immediately jumped off (understood as
     “jumped off the wall”); She walked with us most of the way, and then suddenly ran ahead
     (understood as “ran ahead of us”). Often, however, it is simply implicit in the context.
     The examples in [35] will be understood in suitable contexts as if they included the
     parenthesised words:
284       Chapter 4 The clause: complements
         [35] i a. I didn’t put sugar in (your tea).      b. I’ll take the tablecloth off (the table).
              ii a. Don’t go away (from me/here).         b. I must put the cat out (of the house).
             iii a. Come back (to me /this place).        b. He put his coat on (himself / his body).
         There is considerable variation in the naturalness or likelihood of including such contex-
         tually derivable specification. In [35], for example, the filled out versions in the [b] cases
         are less likely than those in [a]. Including the parenthesised parts of the [b] examples,
         especially [iiib], would normally be regarded as involving an unnecessary specification
         of the obvious.
             We find a great range of meanings with prepositional verbs, from those where there is
         still a transparently clear connection with the literal locative relation to others which are
         much more opaque. Consider, for example, the seven different senses of take in illustrated
         in [36], where [i] is clear from the sense of take and the contextual interpretation of
         in, while [vii] is idiomatic and completely unpredictable from the meanings of take
         and in.
         [36] i We’d better take in the children’s toys.                       [“move into the house”]
                ii They supplement their income by taking in students.                   [“renting to”]
               iii I’ve taken in your trousers, because they were too loose.                [“tighten”]
               iv Grammar takes in syntax and morphology but not phonology.                [“includes”]
                v I thought we might take in a show after dinner.                                [“see”]
               vi I was too tired to take in what she was saying.                             [“grasp”]
              vii I’m not surprised he was taken in: he’s as gullible as a child.         [“deceived”]
            One type of extended meaning commonly found involves what we have called aspec-
         tuality (Ch. 3, §3.2), especially that of completion or perfectivity. This is illustrated in
         [37i], while the examples in [ii] have such other aspectual meanings as repetition and
         duration:
         [37] i break up, catch up, come up (to someone), cut down, drink up/down, eat up, fill
                 up, fizzle out, give up, lace up, round up, sell out, shrivel up, wear out, write up
              ii beaver away, fire away, work away ; carry on, go on, keep on, push on
             Verb + intransitive preposition idioms are an important feature of the English vo-
         cabulary; there are great numbers of them, and they are very frequent indeed, especially
         in informal speech. They tend to involve simple everyday verbs rather than more learned
         ones, and common verbs like bring, come, give, go, have, let, make, put, take, etc., are
         found in large numbers of such idioms, often with a considerable range of meanings, as
         illustrated above for take in.
             Lexicalisation may be accompanied in varying degrees by what we are calling fossilisa-
         tion, the loss of the ability to undergo the range of manipulation found with comparable
         free combinations. Three areas where such loss is found are:      (a) Preposing (Down it went ∼ ∗Down it broke)
          In free combinations, intransitive locative prepositions can generally appear in front
          position, with postposing of the subject if it is not a personal pronoun: Up went the
          balloon ; Down they glided ; In came Kim ; Away we ran. A relatively small number of
          verbal idioms are found in this construction, as in [38i], where the concept of movement
          in a given direction, physical or metaphorical, remains fairly strong, but with the majority
          such preposing is excluded, as illustrated in [ii]:
                                                         § 6.3.1 Lexicalisation and fossilisation   285
   [38] i Down it went.        Off came his shirt.   Up go the ratings.       In went the sun.
        ii ∗Down it broke.    ∗
                               Off went the milk.    ∗
                                                     Up pay the patrons.     ∗
                                                                              In gave the bandit.(b) Insertion of adjunct (climbed slowly up ∼ ∗gave slowly up)
    In free combinations, adjuncts (e.g. of manner) can be inserted before an intransitive
    preposition in complement function, but this possibility is greatly reduced in idioms, as
    seen in:
    [39] i a. She climbed slowly up.             b. She led him triumphantly out.
               ∗
         ii a. She gave slowly up.               b. ∗She knocked him triumphantly out.
   Adjuncts before intransitive prepositions are not excluded altogether: we can have They
   pressed resolutely on or It faded gradually away, contrasting with ∗They carried resolutely
   on or ∗He passed gradually away (“died”), and so on. But in general the close association
   between the verb + preposition sequence inhibits this kind of separation, and the further
   the meaning is from that of a literal combination the less likely it is that such insertion
   will be acceptable.(c) Order alternation (took off the label ∼ took the label off )
    As we noted in §6.2, intransitive prepositions can generally either precede or follow
    the object of the verb: compare [27ia/iia], She took off the label ∼ She took the label off.
    There are some cases, however, where the intransitive preposition can only precede the
    object (unless the latter can have the form of an unstressed personal pronoun), and this
    restriction can be seen as a clear case of fossilisation: the lexical unity bars the usual
    syntactic separability. In the following examples the order alternation is permitted in
    one sense of the verb + prepositional particle combination but not, or at best only very
    marginally, in another – and the fossilised one is clearly further removed from the literal
    meaning of the components:
   [40] i a. He carried out the chairs.              b. He carried the chairs out.
        ii a. He carried out his threat.             b. ? He carried his threat out.
       iii a. He put on his hat.                     b. He put his hat on.
       iv a. He put on an act.                       b. ? He put an act on.
       Other examples of idioms where the particle normally precedes the object are given
   in:
   [41] buy in [food]                drum up [support]            find out [“discover”]
          fork out [money]           give forth [sound]           give off [sound]
          hold out [prospects]       knock up [score in sport]    lay out [requirements]
          let out [cry]              pass out [samples]           pour out [feelings]
          put down [plane: “land”]   put out [leaf, of plant]     put up [resistance]
          ride out [recession]       start up [conversation]
      There are also cases where the intransitive preposition must follow the object (unless
   the latter is heavy) – and where the preposition is therefore by definition not a particle.
   Most of these involve free combinations as in our earlier She brought the bed down-
   stairs ([24iib]). But the restriction does apply to some idioms, and again we can find
286            Chapter 4 The clause: complements
              combinations where alternation is possible in one sense but not another:
          [42] i a. I turned off the tap.                               b. I turned the tap off.
               ii a. ∗His arrogance turned off people.                  b. His arrogance turned people off.
              Examples of idioms virtually requiring the order verb – object – preposition are:49
          [43]        answer back               ask round/over             boss about/around
                      draw out [person]         get up [out of bed]        have down [as guest]
                      have on [“tease”]         have out                   leave alone
                      order about               take aback                 work over [“beat up”]      6.3.2 Constructions containing verb + intransitive preposition idioms
              Verbal idioms of this kind are found in the following structures (again leaving aside those
              containing subordinate clauses as complement):
          [44] i verb – prep                                        He gave in.
               ii verb – prep – O                                   She mixed up [the tickets ].
              iii verb – Oi – prep – Od                             I ran [him] off [another copy].
              iv verb – prep – transitive PP                        We look forward [to your visit].
               v verb – O – prep – transitive PP                    I let [her] in [on a little secret].
              vi verb – prep – (as) PC                              She ended up [(as) captain].
             vii verb – O – prep – [as + PC]                        This showed [him] up [as spineless].
              ‘Prep’ here stands for the intransitive preposition functioning as a complement of the
              verb.","[303, 304, 305, 306]"
"          Grammatical differences between variable echoes and open interrogatives
           (a) Differences between what/who as echo-question words and as interrogative words
           One difference between the two constructions is that these words, especially what, have a
           wider range of uses in variable echo clauses than in open interrogatives. For example, in
           [51iii], He’s proposing to what?, the echo word what is a verb and combines with to to form
           a verb phrase, but interrogative what is not a verb and hence we need do in [55]. Note also:
          [56] i A: He was enthusing about the film.         B: He was whatting about the film?
               ii A: They gave it to Angela Cooke.           B: They gave it to Angela who?
           Example [i] shows that echo what, unlike interrogative what, can inflect. And [ii] shows
           that echo who likewise differs from interrogative who: the latter must always be initial in
           the interrogative phrase.
          (b) Position of echo-question and interrogative words,
          and subject–auxiliary inversion
          In open interrogative clauses a non-subject interrogative element is normally fronted
          and triggers subject–auxiliary inversion; in variable echo clauses a non-subject question
          element always remains in situ and therefore never triggers inversion. Compare, for
          example, echo He’s proposing to what? ([51iii]) with ∗What is he proposing to?, or They
          gave it to Angela who? ([56ii]) with ∗Angela who did they give it to? The absence of fronting
          and inversion serves of course to make the echo maximally like the stimulus that it echoes.
             However, there are places where we find overlap between echoes and ordinary ques-
          tions:
          [57] i Who made a mistake?                                                          [subject]
               ii And the purpose of that was what?                          [post-verbal non-subject]
           Example [i] is the case where the interrogative or echo element is subject, and hence will be
           in pre-verbal position in either case. It could be either an ordinary question with answers
           like The Secretary-General made a mistake or an echo question with the latter as a possible
           stimulus and answers like I said, ‘The Secretary-General made a mistake’. Question [ii] has
           non-subject what after the verb: this is a possible if rare position in open interrogatives,
           as well as the only possible one in echoes, so [ii] could be an ordinary question with such
           answers as The purpose of that was to test the PH level or an echo of a stimulus like the
           latter. The two interpretations would normally be distinguished prosodically: the echo
           construction will generally have a fall + sharp rise on the question word.
           (c) Relation with clause type
           The open interrogative is a clause type, and as such it is mutually exclusive with the
           other clause types. The variable echo construction, by contrast, is not a clause type. It
                                                         § 4.8.3 The form of polar echo questions         889
     is a construction on a quite independent dimension, and can combine with any of the
     clause types:
    [58]          stimulus                           variable echo question
             i A: She’s a genius.                 B: She’s a what?               [declarative]
            ii A: Did Kim complain?               B: Did who complain? [closed interrogative]
           iii A: What did he do last week?       B: What did he do when? [open interrogative]
           iv A: What a fuss Ed made!             B: What a fuss who made?      [exclamative]
            v A: Give the key to Angela.          B: Give what to Angela?        [imperative]
     In each of these, B’s echo question belongs to the same clause type as the corresponding
     stimulus, being derived from it by substituting a question element for some element of
     the stimulus.
        The independence of the variable echo construction from clause type is explicable in
     terms of both form and meaning. As far as its form is concerned, it is marked simply by
     the presence of a question word, and there is no reason why this should not co-occur
     with any of the clause type markers. Notice in particular that the variable echo does
     not determine any features of order, which means that the order of elements in the
     clause is able to be determined by clause type (or other properties). As far as meaning is
     concerned, the variable echo question is indirect; at the direct level it is merely a partial
     repetition, citation, of the stimulus and hence there is no reason why the stimulus should
     not have an illocutionary force of the kind characteristically associated with any of the
     clause types.","[908, 909]"
"       Definition of indirect speech act
           An indirect speech act is one where (a) the propositional content actually expressed
           differs from that which the speaker intends to convey with some illocutionary force, or
           (b) where the illocutionary force is different from that normally conveyed by the clause
           type concerned.
              Most cases are covered by condition (a). The propositional content expressed in [7],
           for example, is “You know what time it is”, whereas the propositional content that I
           intend to convey is “What time is it?” (with question force) or “You go to bed” (with
           directive force). Case (b) is illustrated by [4iii] of §1, Sleep well. At the direct level it is a
           directive (the force characteristically associated with imperative clause type), but since
           sleeping well is not something that we normally regard as being under our control it will
           generally have the indirect force of a wish.4       Degrees of indirectness
           There are varying degrees of indirectness, depending on how different the two propo-
           sitional contents are. The first suggested contextualisation of [7], for example, is less
           indirect than the second because the propositional content of the conveyed “What time       4
           The sense of ‘indirect’ introduced in this section is quite different from the one it has in traditional grammar
           in such expressions as ‘indirect question.’ A traditional indirect question, such as the underlined clause in
           She asked who had done it, is in our terminology a subordinate interrogative, whereas an indirect question in
           the speech-act sense might be I’d be interested to hear your view, when used to convey “What is your view?”
           As it happens, both senses are applicable in [7], but to different parts of it. The subordinate clause what
           time it is is an indirect question in the traditional sense (it is a subordinate interrogative clause), whereas the
           whole utterance is an indirect question in the speech act sense (in the use where it conveys “What time is it?”).
           We will use ‘indirect’ solely in the speech-act sense.
                                                                      § 3.2 Indirect speech acts     863
  is it?” is included as part of that which is actually expressed, whereas “You go to bed” is
  not. Intuitively (for we are not suggesting that the degree of indirectness can be precisely
  calculated), the following are less indirect again, though they still qualify as indirect
  speech acts:
 [8]    i I should like to order two copies of the Penguin edition of Plato’s ‘Republic’.
       ii May I remind you that you agreed to pay for the drinks?
  In the context of a letter to a bookshop, the writer of [i] will be taken to have performed
  the illocutionary act of ordering the goods, but the act is performed indirectly because the
  propositional content expressed is “I should like to order . . .”, not “I (hereby) order . . .”.
  The inference from “I should like to order” to “I order” is a very easy one to make in this
  context, for the wish to order can be fulfilled instantaneously simply by writing the letter
  (and perhaps enclosing payment). Nevertheless, “I should like to order” and “I order”
  are obviously not propositionally equivalent, and it is easy to imagine other contexts
  where the inference would not go through – e.g. in a conversation where the speaker
  adds: but in my present financial plight I can’t afford to do so. Example [ii] conveys “I
  remind you that you agreed to pay for the drinks”, but again that is not the same as the
  propositional content actually expressed. The question concerning permission is here
  vacuous since merely mentioning that you agreed to pay for the drinks itself reminds
  you of that fact, but this does not alter the fact that there is a difference between the
  propositional content expressed and that which I wish to convey.","[882, 883]"

           There are many places where the rule of simple agreement is not followed. A sample of
           attested written examples is given in:
