  Nanu is an exception; it is an alternative long form for the word nana ‗mother‘, which is used only as a vocative to
express very intense emotion.
10.4 Grammar                                                                                                        125Example         An ne, tada.              ‗I am going, sir.‘
Long and short forms of words may be used as a vocative. Long forms usually indicate intense emotion such as
fear, frustration, or anger.
Example      ¡Paba, an tobe!              ‗Father, I‘m frightened!‘
When employing a vocative, it is more common to use the role, status, or kinship term for a person, than his
proper name.
Example        Yai, an ne.                      ‗Older brother, I am going.‘10.4.7 Indirect object (Ex. 14)
The indirect object in Kuna functions in approximately the same way that it does in English. For example, ―I
gave the ball to the boy‖ specifies the person to whom the ball was given as the boy (indirect object).
In Kuna, the indirect object usually occurs after the subject and before the direct object and verb in transitive
sentences, or before a verb of ―saying.‖ It is marked by the addition of the suffix -ga/-ka to the noun, proper
name or pronoun.
Examples
      1. An pega mol ukcha.                      ‗I gave the blouse to you.‘
      2. An machiga chogzha.                     ‗I said (it) to the boy.‘
If, however, the indirect object is in focus, it occurs after the verb.
Examples
    1. An mol ukcha, pega.                      ‗I gave the cloth to you.‘
    2. An chogzha, machiga.                     ‗(I said (it) to the boy. (I told the boy.)‘
Exercise 14. Indirect object substitution frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame. The teacher selects a word from the list below that can be substituted in the
frame and says it. The student then substitutes the word in the correct place in the frame.
Example        Teacher: An pega chegar ukcha.
               Teacher: ai
               Student: An aiga chegar ukcha.
    Frame      An ____-ga/-ka chegar ukcha. ‗I gave matches to ____.‘
     1. pe             ‗you‘
     2. pab            ‗father‘
     3. nan            ‗mother‘
     4. mu             ‗grandmother/respected older lady‘
     5. tad            ‗grandfather/respected older man‘
     6. ai             ‗friend‘10.4.8 Affected (interested) object
A common usage of the suffix -ga/-ka is in a situation that affects the present speaker in a similar way to which
it affected the original speaker. For example, when the original speaker says things are going well with him, the
present speaker may say, ―It is going well with me, too.‖
Example          Nuedmoga.                      ‗It is going well with me, too.‘
If the effect is to occur in the future, the -moga becomes -mogo.
Example        Nuedmogo.                        ‗It will go well with me, too.‘
126                                                                                    Grouping Objects, People, or Actions10.4.9 Habitual aspect51 (Ex. 15–16)
Certain events that we speak of happen regularly; they are habits, or customary. ―Tigers eat deer.‖ is an example
of an habitual action. The event of a tiger eating deer is not a one-time event, but rather something that happens
all the time, habitually. In English, the present tense of the verb is used to describe habitual actions. In Kuna,
the short form of the verb stem is used alone without any suffix.
Example           Achu parpad koe kun.               ‗Tigers eat (habitually) deer.‘
Exercise 15. Habitual aspect frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it.
This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example          Teacher: Tule ua kun.
                 Student: Tule ua kun.
         1. Tule ua kun.                             ‗Kunas eat fish.‘
         2. An ina che.                              ‗I practice medicine.‘
         3. An mol pak.                              ‗I (always) buy blouses.‘
         4. An nugal unke.                           ‗I (always) pull teeth.‘
         5. An ome mol mak.                          ‗My wife (always) sews blouses.‘
Exercise 16. Habitual aspect drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student changes it to the habitual aspect form of the verb and adds the word
pane-pane ‗everyday‘.52
Example          Teacher: Machi ua kucha.
                 Student: Machi pane-pane ua kun.
         1. Machi ua kucha.                 ‗The boy ate the fish.‘
         2. Tad ua chwas.                   ‗The elder caught fish.‘
         3. Pun mol enukcha.                ‗The girl washed the clothes.‘
         4. Mu mol makne.                   ‗The old lady is going to sew a blouse.‘
         5. Ome mas tus.                    ‗The woman cooked food.‘10.4.10 Adverbs (Ex. 17–18)
Adverbs in Kuna, as in English, modify the verb; but their position in the sentence is different from English
word order. In Kuna, they occur after the subject and before the indirect or direct object: subject + adverb +
indirect object + direct object + verb.
Subtle nuances of meaning are achieved by changing this basic word order and are discussed in later lessons.
Example
       Pab pirkin machi pilal.                       ‗The father loves the boy very much.‘
Exercise 17. Adverbial word order frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc.","[137, 138, 139]"
"5. Conclusion
The suffix -do/-to indicates the conclusion (resolution) of a conversation and is equivalent to the English
expression, ―Let‘s go, then.‖ or to the Spanish expression, ―Vamos pues.‖
                                                       295
296                                                                                       Topics of ConversationExample       Nemaldo.                       ‗Let‘s go, then.‘6. Affirmation
The suffix -do/-to is also used to affirm something.
Example       An wichuldo.                   ‗I do not know.‘7. Word order
The normal word order in Kuna is subject + object + predicate.
Example        Omedin we mol pakcha.           ‗The woman bought that blouse.‘
―The woman‖ in the above example is not only the subject of the sentence, but also the topic of the conversation
as indicated by the topic-establishing suffix -din.
In another situation, it might be the blouse which is under discussion, and the speaker merely comments on the
fact that the woman bought it. In that case, the topic of conversation is the blouse and a Kuna speaker would
change the word order of the sentence by putting the topic (the blouse) first; i.e., topic (object) + subject +
predicate.
The topic is always first in a Kuna sentence (following any setting or conjunction), and usually occurs with a
topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin.
Example
          We moldin, ome pakcha.                           ‗That blouse was bought by the woman. (Lit.: As for
                                                           the blouse, the woman bought (it).)‘
In summary, it may be said that when the subject of the sentence is not the topic of conversation, the normal
word order is rearranged and the topic is positioned at the beginning of the main part of the sentence.
            APPENDIX F: FURTHER NOTES ON -BAL/-PAL
When the suffix - bal/-pal is used in conjunction with the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi, the order of the suffixes
varies according to the significance of the utterance. That is to say, the order of suffixes varies according to the
focus of the desire.","[308, 309, 310]"
"2.4 Grammar
2.4.1 Word order (Ex. 29–30)
Most languages allow for some variation in the normal word order for specific reasons. In Kuna, the normal
word order is different from Spanish or English. Normal word order in the transitive sentence is subject, object,
predicate.
Example
       Subject            Object              Predicate
       An                 ogob                kumpi.
       I                  coconut             eat-want-to
       ‗I want to eat coconut.‘
Exercise 29. Word order -- object substitution drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it. The teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc.
This exercise should be repeated several times.

             Student: An kallin pakpi.
             Teacher: An nuzha pakpi.
             Student: An nuzha pakpi.
     1. An kallin pakpi.                      ‗I want to buy a chicken.‘
     2. An nuzha pakpi.                       ‗I want to buy eggs.‘
     3. An mol pakpi.                         ‗I want to buy cloth.‘
     4. An kachi pakpi.                       ‗I want to buy a hammock.‘
     5. An ogob pakpi.                        ‗I want to buy coconuts.‘
     6. An mas kumpi.                         ‗I want to eat plantains.‘
     7. An ua kumpi.                          ‗I want to eat fish.‘
     8. An chan kumpi.                        ‗I want to eat meat.‘
     9. An mam kumpi.                         ‗I want to eat manioc.‘
    10. An aswe kumpi.                        ‗I want to eat an avocado.‘
Note 1: Phonological Changes
In forming words, it is important to realize that if certain consonants occur before certain other consonants, the
first consonant changes: n (nn: see section 2.2.6) becomes m if it occurs before p.
Example      kun + -pi = kumpi                ‗want to eat‘
Note 2: Concept of Plural
In Spanish and English, in most cases, the speaker must distinguish between singular and plural, e.g., the
speaker must choose between boy and boys, egg and eggs, etc. In Kuna, this is not so. The speaker does not
need to distinguish (and generally does not distinguish) between singular and plural. The concept of plural and
the means of distinguishing plural from singular is dealt with in Lesson 13.4.3.
Exercise 30. Direct object substitution drill
The teacher repeats the frame and then says any word from the list below. The student then substitutes the word
in the frame.
Example        Teacher: An kallin pakpi.
               Teacher: mola
               Student: An mola pakpi.
               Teacher: An mola pakpi.
               Teacher: ogob
               Student: An ogob pakpi.
     Frame An ____ pakpi.                ‗I want to buy ____.‘
      1. kallin              ‗chicken‘

Desires can be divided into two areas. One either wants to do something (desiderative action) or wants to have
something (desiderative state).","[32, 33, 34]"
"1) Verb form of a polite command
      The polite command is formed by adding the suffix -o to the verb stem.89
Examples
    1. Anka uko.                  ‗Please give it to me.‘
    2. Anche tago.                ‗Please come to me.‘2) Additional information in a polite command
      Additional information, such as a phrase to clarify the purpose of an action or goal of a motion, is
      mandatory90 in a polite command. Or, a polite command may include a direct object, indirect object, or
      some other phrase. The subject is rarely stated. Word order of a polite command follows normal pattern;
      that is to say, the additional information always precedes the verb.",[207]
"14.4.6.1 Purpose clause - explanation of action
One type of purpose clause is formed by adding the purposive suffix -gal/-kal to the verb (stem) of the
(purpose) clause. This type of purpose construction is used to give a straightforward explanation of the purpose
or desired goal of the action in the independent sentence. It parallels the English construction, ―He went
shopping to buy shoes.‖ In this construction, the focus is on the independent sentence. The speaker wishes to
express one main idea, but adds the purpose construction to give additional background information. Hence, the
purpose clause does not advance the listener to the next step in the story/explanation/argument, but rather gives
the motive for the main action.
Although a purpose clause may occur in the adverbial position in a sentence, it usually occurs at the end of a
sentence in the postpredicate position (see 17.4.1).
Examples
    1. Machimal ya akinai, ti ariogal.                   ‗The boys are digging a ditch (hole), to let the water
                                                         flow (out).‘
     2a. Nandin mol makcha, manigin ukegal.              ‗Mother sewed a blouse to sell for money.‘
      b. Nandin manigin ukegal mol makcha.               ‗Mother sewed the blouse to sell it for money.‘
When the subject and/or object of the purpose clause is the same as that of the independent sentence, it is not
repeated in the purpose clause.
Example
         An mol pakcha, nanga ukegal.                ‗I bought cloth (for me) to give (it) to Mother.‘
However, if the subject of the main clause becomes the indirect object of the purpose clause, it must be repeated
with the suffix -ga/-ka.
Example
       An ina pakcha, nan anka madu chobgal.            ‗I bought yeast, for Mother to make bread for me.‘14.4.6.2 Purpose clause - event precipitated by action of independent sentence
Another type of purpose clause expresses the event which, it is hoped, will be precipitated by the action in the
independent sentence. This clause begins with meke ‗in order that‘ and the purposive suffix -gal/-kal is added
to the verb.
The purpose clause marked by meke ‗in order to‘ focusses more attention on the purpose than on the main
action. It expresses the desired outcome or result (as yet unfulfilled) of the main action. It is part of the mainline
information and advances the story/explanation/argument another step in the logical progression.
The meke form of a purpose clause almost always occurs in the postpredicate position. Even though the subject
may be the same in both clauses, it must be stated in both clauses.
14.4 Grammar                                                                                                      181Examples
      1. Antin pe pabga mani palmine, meke adin          ‗I am going to send money to your father, in order
           Panamaje taggal.                              that he will come to Panama.‘
      2. Antin immis mani amine, meke an pan             ‗I am going to get money today, so that I can buy
           nabir immal pakegal.                          (some) things tomorrow.‘
In order to understand the change of focus given by the use of the word meke, contrast Example 1 above with
the following sentence, in which the purpose of sending money is explained, rather than focussing on the goal
of having your father come to Panama.
Example
          Antin pe pabga mani palmine, adin               ‗I am going to send money to your father, to/for him
          Panamaje taggal.                                to come to Panama.‘14.4.6.3 Purpose clause - event prevented by independent sentence action
This third type of purpose clause expresses the event which, it is hoped, will be averted/prevented by the action
in the independent sentence. This clause begins with the adverb melle ‗don‘t‘ and the purposive suffix -gal/-kal
is added to the verb. This parallels the English construction ―in order not to....‖
Example
       Pe anka chogo, melle an igegal.                 ‗You tell me, in order that I will not forget.‘
Exercise 13. Purposive suffix -gal/-kal frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example      Teacher: Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.
             Student: Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.
     1.   Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.             ‗The chief gave (me) money in order to buy corn.‘
     2.   An ne, immal pakegal.                     ‗I am going, in order to buy something.‘
     3.   Machimal ya kinai, ti ariogal.            ‗The boys are digging a ditch, in order for the water to
                                                    flow (away).‘
     4.   An akan amine, tad ul chobgal.            ‗I am going to look for an axe in order for grandfather

     5.   An kal palmis, nudagal.                   ‗I sent the radio, in order to repair it.‘Exercise 14. Purposive suffix -gal/-kal drill
The teacher reads the pair of sentences. The student makes the second sentence into a purpose clause by using
-gal/-kal.
Example       Teacher: Machi kinki pakcha.
              Teacher: Machi immal amine
              Student: Machi kinki pakcha, immal aminegal.

The teacher says the sentence and then says either meke or melle. The student uses the frame to make a
sentence incorporating the sentence said by the teacher as a purpose clause.
Example       Teacher: An ne.
              Teacher: melle
              Student: Pe anka chogo, melle an negal.

       5. An machi odurtas.              ‗I punished the boy.‘14.4.6.4 Noun of purpose (implement)
An implement or tool used in performing a certain task or action may be referred to by adding the suffix
-gal/-kal to the verb stem that describes the action itself.
Examples
     1a. turwi                   ‗to sweep‘
      b. turwigal                ‗broom‘
     2a. igmu                    ‗to burrow‘
      b. igmugal                 ‗(type of) hoe (for burrowing in the earth) (Spanish: coa)‘
This device for naming implements cannot be used for all implements. Some forms are unacceptable, and some
are never used. It is very useful, however, in describing a tool foreign to the culture.","[193, 194, 195]"
"19.4.7.1 Intrinsically causative verbs
Verbs which are intrinsically causative may be used in causative commands without affixation.
Example
       Anche machi palmidago.                         ‗Send the boy to me (lit.: make the boy come to me).‘19.4.7.2 Verbs with a causative form
Verbs with a causative form (see 19.4.6) may also be used in a causative command.
112
      t initial becomes lenis d in odurta ‗to teach‘.
113
      k initial becomes lenis g in ogob ‗to cause to drink‘.
19.4 Grammar                                                                                                     263Example        Machi ina ogobo.                ‗Make the boy drink the medicine.‘19.4.7.3 Verb ima „to make‟ in causative command
If a verb is not intrinsically causative and has no causative form, the imperative form of the verb ima ‗to make‘
is used. The purpose suffix -gal/-kal is added to the verb which is to be carried out. The action verb plus
-gal/-kal is followed by the actor and subsequently by imako ‗make‘.
Example
         (Pe) neg chobgal machi imako.                ‗(You) make the boy build the house.‘
Note the difference in word order. In this example, machi, the one caused to do the action, precedes ―to make‖
while the object of building occurs in the normal order for a direct object. On the other hand, in the example for
Exercise 12, machi occurs in the normal order for an indirect object but without the suffix -ga/-ka.","[275, 276]"

                                             ABSTRACT
The purpose of this grammar is to help any interested person learn to speak and understand Paya Kuna ,
which is spoken by the people of Paya, Pucuru, and Capetí in the Darién province of the Republic of Panama
and in the Kuna settlements of Arquía and Kudi on the Colombian side of the border. This volume deals with
some of the most basic characteristics of Kuna pronunciation and grammar, and it provides appendices on
various topics and a fairly extensive Paya Kuna vocabulary. Many important characteristics are not discussed
in this volume, but hopefully, after mastering these first twenty lessons the student will be equipped to
continue self-directed language learning. The grammar was designed primarily for use in a classroom where
the teacher is a native speaker of Kuna, but it also lends itself to learning Kuna in the informal situation of a
Paya Kuna village. Each section is not meant to be covered in a single class period, but normally consists of a
dialogue, pronunciation notes, notes on cultural etiquette, grammar aspects and exercises, and vocabulary
items for memorization. Emphasis is put on learning by mimicking in chorus and alone until the speech
patterns become automatic, thus, using a conversational approach to learning a language. An attempt is made
throughout to not only explain and drill the forms discussed, but also to enable language students to know in
which situational contexts their use is appropriate. An effort was also made to show the inseparability of the
Kuna language from its socio-cultural context.

                            THE PAYA KUNA ALPHABET
To simplify reference, Paya Kuna will be referred to as ―Kuna.‖ For pedagogical purposes some modifications
of the official Kuna alphabet have been employed in the spelling of Kuna words in the body of the text. In the
vocabulary in Volume 3, if the official spelling differs from the practical one adopted for this grammar, it is
given in square brackets.

                   1 BASIC GREETINGS AND TAKING LEAVE
1.1 Dialogue
When you first encounter a Kuna speaker, it is important to establish rapport. The first step is the use of
greetings and leave-takings appropriate to the occasion. One of the common formats for greeting and
leave-taking is given in this Dialogue.
Upon arrival:
        1.    Visitor:          Anná.1                              ‗Hello.‘
        2.    Villager:         Mai./Chi.                           ‗I‘m home (masculine)./I‘m home (feminine).‘ (see
                                                                    I.D.1.)
    3. Visitor:                 An pe taktani.                      ‗I‘ve come to see you.‘
    4. Villager:                Ajáj. Toge.                         ‗Come in.‘
    5. Visitor:                 Nabiri.                             ‗Okay.‘
    6. Villager:                Chigwe.                             ‗Sit down.‘
    7. Visitor:                 Nabiri.                             ‗Okay.‘
Upon departure:
        8.    Visitor:          Nade.                               ‗I‘m going.‘
        9.    Villager:         Eye.                                ‗Yes‘1.2 Pronunciation
1.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2)
In learning another language as an adult, you will have to break one set of habits and acquire a new set as
required by the new language. One of the first is intonation, the ―tune‖ of what is being said, since Kuna
intonation differs from that of English or Spanish. Learning the intonation patterns is very important to your
future control of the language. Learn them at the beginning so you do not have to unlearn wrong patterns later.
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher (not another student) as he says Dialogue 1.1 by humming the intonation patterns (―tune‖).
Note: Humming the intonation patterns should be done before any attempt is made to master the individual
(segmental) sounds.
Attention should be paid to pitch, intensity, rhythm, etc. In short, mimic everything you can say with your
mouth still firmly shut! Further practice can be gained by mimicking the teacher under your breath, while he
is working with other students. Do not mimic other students.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 1.1. Pronounce the individual sounds as best you can without 1) slowing down
or, 2) losing the intonation pattern.
Note: If you have trouble with a particular sound, you should master the sound by using the drills designed
specifically for the sound, not by trying to master it in the dialogue.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"9.4 Grammar
Adjectives
Adjectives in Kuna, as in Spanish and English, are modifiers of a person or object and are used in conjunction
with the noun in order to describe it more fully. Most Kuna adjectives are part of a noun phrase and convey a
concept similar to the English/Spanish adjectival concept. Since some aspects of negation of adjectives and of
Kuna color are unique, they are described apart from the general discussion on adjectives. The formation of
attributive and existence sentences is also unique.",[117]

     See 14.4.6 for purpose clauses.
188                                                                                              Social InteractionExamples
     1. An pegin ibzhe.                  ‗I believe in you.‘
     2. An Pab Tummadgin ibzhe.          ‗I believe in God.‘
     3. An pebal ibzhe.                  ‗I believe in what you say.‘
     4. An Pab Tummadbal ibzhe.          ‗I believe in what God has said.‘
    Although the term ―to obey‖ sounds almost identical to ―to believe what (you) say‖, the construction is
    actually quite different.
Examples
    1. An pe palli ibzhe.          ‗I obey you.‘
    2. An pebal ibzhe.             ‗I believe in what you say.‘14.4.9 Speaking verbs (Ex. 25)
There are four commonly used speaking verbs:
     1. chog                       ‗to say/tell‘
     2. chunma                     ‗to talk‘
     3. ekis                       ‗to ask‘
     4. kol                        ‗to call (to)‘14.4.9.1 Indirect object of speaking verbs
The indirect object (the person addressed) of each of the speaking verbs listed above uses different suffixes so
that the specific suffix used with each speaking verb must be memorized:
 1. ____-ga/-ka chog                         ‗to say to (someone)‘
 2. ____-bak/-pak chunma                     ‗to talk with (someone)‘
 3. ____-zhe/-che/-je ekis                   ‗to ask of (someone)‘
 4. ____-zhe/-che/-je kol                    ‗to call to (someone at a distance)‘
Examples
     1a. Sagla anka chogzha.                        ‗The chief told (said to) me.‘
      b. An pega chogo.                             ‗I‘ll tell (say to) you.‘
     2a. An pabbak chunmas.                         ‗I talked with father.‘
      b. Sagla ambak chunmane.                      ‗The chief is going to talk with me.‘
     3a. An tadzhe ekichis.                         ‗I asked the elder.‘
      b. Pedro saglaje ekisbi.                      ‗Peter wants to ask the chief.‘
     4a. Ome punzhe kocha.83                        ‗The woman called (to) the girl.‘
      b. An peje kolo.                              ‗I‘ll call (to) you.‘
Exercise 25. Speaking verb indirect object selection drill
The teacher says the sentence and then selects another speaking verb and says it. The student repeats the
sentence changing the verb and giving the correct form of the indirect object. This exercise should be repeated
several times.
Example          Teacher: An machiga chogzha.
                 Teacher: chunmas
                 Student: An machibak chunmas.
83
     kol becomes kocha in the completed aspect.

         3. Machi saglaje ekisne.                    ‗The boy is going to ask the chief.‘
         4. Ome punzhe kocha.84                      ‗The woman called the girl.‘
         5. Nan ammabak chunmas.                     ‗Mother talked with auntie.‘14.4.9.2 Subject matter of speaking verbs
When the subject matter of a speaking verb 85 involves a person or the things a person said, the specific or
general instrument suffixes are used.
The specific instrument suffix -gin/-kin is attached to the pronoun or name of the person being talked about and
around whom the conversation revolves.
Examples
      1. Anmal pegin chunmas.                 ‗We talked about you.‘
      2. Sagla nangin chunmas.                ‗The chief talked about Mother.‘
      3. María Silviagin chunmas.             ‗Mary talked about Silvia.‘
The general instrument suffix -bal/-pal is used to refer to what a person talked about rather than talking about
the person. The suffix is attached to the name or pronominal reference to the person.
Example      Anmal pebal chunmas.             ‗We talked about what you said.‘
Word order dictates that the subject matter of the conversation comes after the person spoken to and before the
verb.
Examples
       1. An saglabak pegin chunmas.                 ‗I talked to the chief about you.‘
       2. An tummadga pebal chogzha.                 ‗I told the leader what you had said.‘
Some further examples may help to clarify the use of a person as an indirect object, as the topic of conversation
or as the one who said something.
Examples
The speaker reports the person to the chief, probably for allegedly bad behavior:
     1a. An saglaga pe chogzha.                            ‗I told the chief on you.‘
The speaker tells the chief details about a person or the details about an incident involving a person:
      b. An saglaga pegin chogzha.                               ‗I told the chief about you.‘
The speaker tells the chief what the person said:
         c. An saglaga pebal chogzha.                            ‗I told the chief what you said.‘
        2a. An saglaje pe ekichis.                               ‗I asked the chief your whereabouts. (lit.: I asked the
                                                                 chief for you.)‘
84
     The completed aspect of the verb kol ‗to call‘ is kocha.

                                                                  you?, etc.)‘
          c. An saglaje pebal ekichis.                            ‗I asked the chief about what you said.‘14.4.10 Direct speech
The clause with a verb of speaking, for example, ―He said,...,‖ almost always precedes the quotation (what is
said).
Occasionally, the response to a question or proposal will precede the clause of speaking, as seen in the boy‘s
response to the chief in the following example.
Example
    1. Sagla machiga chogal:                         ‗The chief began to say to the boy,‘
    2. --Pe negzhe nao.                              ‗―Go home!‖‘
    3. --Nabir-- Nega chog.                          ‗―Fine!‖ the boy replied to him.‘
    4. --Pedrodin ampak nao.                         ‗―Peter will go with me.‖‘14.4.11 Verbs of thinking
In Kuna, three different verbs are used which can be translated by the English verb, ―to think.‖ A difference is
made between an opinion held, the process of thinking (cogitating) and surmise.","[200, 201, 202, 203]"
"1) Implied time reference
     In the case of the implied (unspecified) time reference, the listener understands the time to be the time the
     speaker made his statement. The preceding examples and exercises fall into this category.
Example       An ua pakne.                  ‗I am going to buy fish.‘
    In this example, the listener understands that the speaker is going to buy fish right now (at this time of
    speaking).
30                                                                                          Conversational Replies2) Specified time reference
     The speaker must specify the time an action will take place, if the action is not going to take place at the
     time he is speaking. This is done by the use of a time word at the beginning of the sentence.
Example       Pan an mol makne.               ‗Tomorrow I am going to sew a blouse.‘
Exercise 15. Time reference varied substitution frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame and selects any word from the list below and says it. The student substitutes the
word in the frame.
Examples       Teacher: An mol makne.             ‗I am going to sew a blouse.‘
               Teacher: pan                       ‗tomorrow‘
               Student: Pan an mol makne.         ‗Tomorrow I am going to sew a blouse.‘
               Teacher: An mol makne.             ‗I am going to sew a blouse.‘
               Teacher: achul                     ‗day after tomorrow‘
               Student: Achul an mol makne. ‗The day after tomorrow I am going to sew a blouse.‘
     Frame An mol makne.                     ‗I am going to sew a blouse.‘
      1. kujal                ‗later‘
      2. chedo                ‗in the afternoon‘
      3. wakur                ‗in the morning‘
      4. yoroku               ‗at noon‘
      5. pan                  ‗tomorrow‘
      6. achul                ‗day after tomorrow‘
Exercise 16. Immediate future drill
The teacher gives the stimulus in the desiderative form. The student replies in the form of a statement using the
-ne form. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: An ob kumpi.
              Student: An ob kunne.
      1. Pan an ob tigbi.                     ‗Tomorrow I want to plant corn.‘
      2. Achul an ob emibi.                   ‗Day after tomorrow I want to weed corn.‘
      3. Kujal an ob pakpi.                   ‗Later I want to buy corn.‘
      4. Yoroku an ob chubi.                  ‗At noon I want to fetch corn.‘
      5. Pan an ob weibi.                     ‗Tomorrow I want to harvest corn.‘3.4.3 Intransitive sentence word order
In Kuna, the normal word order for an intransitive sentence is subject, then predicate. This is similar to the word
order in intransitive sentences in English.
Example
       Subject           Predicate
       An                abarmane.
       I                 run-going-to
       ‗I am going to run.‘3.4.4 Long and short forms of words
Many (but not all) Kuna words have a short form and a long form. The short form of a word is made by
dropping the final vowel.
3.4 Grammar                                                                                                          31A few short forms end in one of the fortis consonants which is represented by a double symbol, such as nn. By
convention, a single symbol is used to represent the word final fortis consonant in cases in which the double
symbol is used in other positions in the word.
zh/ch become ss/s respectively, in word final position (4.2.5), but both are written s.
Examples
    1. b            nab                   naba           ‗gourd‘
    2. p            nap                   napa           ‗earth‘
    3. d            tad                   tada           ‗grandfather‘

   18. ch           nus                   nucha          ‗worm‘3.4.5 Contrast of subject
As you begin hearing and using Kuna, you may notice that a Kuna person sometimes adds the suffix -din2 to
pronouns, proper names and nouns. This suffix is used to mark a change or a contrast of subjects (see Appendix E).","[42, 43, 44]"
"3.4 Grammar
3.4.1 Yes/No questions
As stated in 3.2.3.2, the order of words in a question requiring an eye ‗yes‘ or chuli ‗no‘ answer is the same as
the order of the words in a statement. In conversation, a question is distinguished from a statement by
intonation. In writing, a question is distinguished from a statement by punctuation (question marks).
Example         ¿Pe mas tune?                     ‗Are you going to cook?‘3.4.2 Verb tense aspect - immediate future (Ex. 12–16)
When an event is viewed by the speaker as being imminent (the action will undoubtedly take place), the
tense-aspect11 used is called the immediate future. In using the immediate future, keep two things in mind: the
immediate future suffix is added to the verb and a time reference must be either stated or implied.",[41]
"1) Verb form of a very polite command
      A very polite command may be formed in one of three ways:
      a) Insert the suffix -gwel/-kwel between the verb stem and the future aspect suffix -o of the polite
      command form. No subject is used. In the case of the verb ne ‗to go‘, the request command form is
      negwelo, that is to say, the polite command form of the verb, nao, is not used in this construction.
Examples
     1. An pentakkwelo.                      ‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘
     2. Anche taggwelo.                      ‗I would like you to be so kind as to come to me.‘
    b) Use the future aspect form of the verb preceded by the word wis ‗a little‘. In this case (as in future
    statements), the subject is included. The intonation pattern of a command is used.
Example      Pe wis an pentako.              ‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘
    c) Use both the word wis ‗a little‘ and the suffix -gwel/-kwel with the future aspect of the verb. That is to
    say, wis precedes the verb and the suffix -gwel/-kwel is inserted before the future aspect suffix -o in the
    verb. The subject is included.
Example        Pe wis an pentakkwelo.         ‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘2) Additional information stated in the request
      As stated above, a subject must be used when the word wis ‗a little‘ is used in the request command. The
      subject precedes wis and the rest of the very polite command follows normal word order. Wis can be
      repeated before the verb to make the request very polite: vocative + subject + wis + indirect object + direct
      object + verb ( + -gwel/-kwel) ( + -o).
Example
           Pedro, pe wis anka ina (wis) ukkwelo.           ‗Peter, I would like it if you would give me the medicine.‘3) Questioning request
      When the speaker is not sure whether or not the listener can meet a request, he uses a questioning request.
      This construction is formed by using the word wis ‗a little‘ with the suffix -ji following the future suffix.
      A question intonation pattern is used (see 3.2.3). The use of -ji expects a positive (yes) answer.
Example        ¿An wis pentakoji?             ‗Would you be so kind as to help me?‘
Exercise 12. wis very polite command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

      3. Amma, pe wis nanbak nao.          ‗Aunt, I would like you to please go with Mother.‘
      4. Luis, pe wis anche tago.          ‗Louis, I would like you to please come to me.‘

      2. You want the chief to come over to you.
      3. You want a friend to come.
      4. You want someone to come urgently.
      5. You want to coax a reluctant friend to come.","[213, 214]"
"1) Answer to a question
        In Kuna, when an answer to a question includes a group of participants, the construction is handled by
        giving the name of one participant, the name of the other participant, the number of participants, and the
        verb: participant + participant + number of participants + verb.
Example
       Juan, María; walbo nad.                   ‗John, Mary; two went. (John and Mary went.)‘2) Statement
        If, however, you were merely stating that John and Mary went, you would use a generic term to include
        the people in the group, a verb, the name of a participant, the name of another participant, the number of
        people and a verb: generic term + verb; name of participant, name of other participant; number of
        participants + verb.
        The generic term in this construction may be tulemal ‗people‘, amal ‗they‘, or the number which
        represents the participants such as walbo ‗two people‘.
Examples
    1. Tulemal nade; Juan, María; walbo nade.                 ‗People went; John, Mary; two went. (John and Mary

Two different, but approximately simultaneous actions, may be brought together by adding the suffix -bal/-pal
to the second verb. The English equivalent of this construction is ―too‖ or ―also.‖
Example
              Machi mas kunne. Kabi komnebal.              ‗The boy is going to eat food. (He) is going to drink
                                                           coffee too.‘
The suffix -bal can also be added to a verb in order to refer to an action which is repeated. The English
equivalent to this construction is the word ―again.‖
47
     This construction uses a listing pattern, and the long form of the word is used (see 5.4.2).

    1. Machi atas. Mas kunnebal.                ‗The boy awakened. (He) is going to eat again.‘
    2. Machi nadbal.                            ‗The boy went again.‘10.4.3.2 Associating different actions which occur in a time sequence
If one action does not take place until the other action is at least started, the two actions are joined by the
conjunction tegin ‗then‘.
Examples
    1. Machi mas kunne. Tegin ua chwane.                     ‗The boy is going to eat. Then he is going fishing.‘
    2. Pab chapur kugne. Tegin aros tigne.                   ‗Father is going to burn fields. Then he is going to
                                                             plant rice.‘10.4.4 Repetition of an attribute (state) (Ex. 10–11)
In an attributive sentence, if the state referred to by the attribute is repeated, the suffix -bal/-pal is attached to
the attribute (adjective).
Example        Mimmi yebal.                     ‗The baby is sick again.‘
Exercise 10. Repetitive action frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it.
This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: An mas kunnebal.
              Student: An mas kunnebal.
       1. An mas kunnebal.              ‗I am going to eat food again.‘
       2. An ob tignebal.               ‗I am going to plant corn again.‘
       3. An ua tunebal.                ‗I am going to cook fish again.‘
       4. An mas kuchabal.              ‗I ate food again.‘
       5. An ob tigzhabal.              ‗I planted corn again.‘
       6. An ua tusbal.                 ‗I cooked fish again.‘
       7. An mas kumpalo.               ‗I will eat food again.‘
       8. An ob tigbalo.                ‗I will plant corn again.‘
       9. An ua tubalo.                 ‗I will cook fish again.‘
      10. An palu nikpal.               ‗I have salt again.‘
Exercise 11. Stimulus response drill
The teacher gives the stimulus in the form of a statement. The student responds using the -bal/-pal ‗again‘ form.
Example        Teacher: Machi ul chomne.
               Student: Machi ul chomnebal.
       1. Machi ul chomne.               ‗The boy is going to make a canoe.‘
       2. Ome mol makcha.                ‗The woman sewed a blouse.‘
       3. Wag ostigid nika.              ‗The outsider has sugar.‘
       4. Machi aswe chus.               ‗The boy fetched an avocado.‘
       5. Pun mu kolne.                  ‗The girl is going to call grandmother.‘
       6. Sagla koe mecha.               ‗The chief killed a deer.‘
       7. Wag noni.                      ‗The outsider arrived.‘
       8. Mimmi ye.                      ‗The baby is sick.‘

It is important to recognize that suffixes occur in a specific order following the verb stem. To make the order of
suffixes easier to remember, suffixes are grouped below and the groups are numbered in the order in which they
appear following the verb stem. Group I comes directly after the verb stem, Group II follows Group I, etc:48
verb + Group I49 + Group II + Group III + ...
    Group I - immediate future suffix -ne (see 3.4.2 and 10.4.1), completive aspect suffix -che/-zhe/-je (see
    4.4.1), present progressive (see 6.4.2) and desiderative -bi/-pi (see 2.4.2). (See also Appendix F for
    alternate order of -bi/-pi.)
    Group II - group marker suffix -mal (see 8.4.3.1)
    Group III - -bal/-pal ‗again‘ (see 10.4.3 and 10.4.4)
    Group IV - -mo ‗too‘ (see 10.4.2.1)
    Group V - future suffix -o (see 10.4.1.1 and 10.4.1.2)
Examples
    1. Verb + Group I + Group III
       Ome mol pakchabal.                            ‗The woman bought cloth again.‘
    2. Verb + Group III + Group IV
       Juan nebalmo.                                 ‗John is going to go again too.‘
   3a. Verb + Group I + Group III + Group IV
       An mol maknebalmo.                            ‗I am going to sew again too.‘
    b. Pan an mas kunnebalmo.                        ‗Tomorrow I am going to eat plantains again too.‘
    4. Verb + Group III + Group V
       Machi tagbalo.                                ‗The boy will come again.‘
    5. Verb + Group IV + Group V
       An mas kunmoo.                                ‗I will eat again (sometime).‘
    6. Verb + Group I + Group II + Group III
       Machergandin yannu aminebalmal.               ‗The men are (all) going to go hunting peccary again.‘
    7. Verb + Group II + Group III + Group IV
       Machimaldina nemalbalmo.                      ‗The boys are (all) going to go again too.‘
Exercise 12. Grouping of suffixes
The most common grouping of suffixes is the grouping of Groups I, III, and IV. For that reason, we will drill
these groups in the following exercise.
          The student says Sentence a.
             Tad cho chikne.                                 ‗The grandfather is going to cut firewood.‘
          Add Sentence b saying that the participant b is also going to perform the action of Sentence a.
              Tad cho chikne. Machi cho chiknemo.           ‗The grandfather is going to cut firewood. The boy is
                                                            going to cut firewood, too.‘
          Construct Sentence c which says that participant b is going to repeat his action.
              Machi cho chiknebal.                           ‗The boy is going to cut firewood again.‘
          Repeat Sentences a and b, inserting Sentence d, which says that participant a is going to repeat his action,
          then adding Sentence c, modified to say that participant b is going to repeat his action, also.","[133, 134, 135, 136]"
"5.4.3.3 Basic number stem
The basic number stems of Kuna are used in counting items in much the same way as items are counted in
Spanish and English. The stems, however, are never used by themselves; they always occur with a prefix (see
5.4.1.3). It is important to memorize the basic number stems.
      1. -gwen(na)              ‗one‘
      2. -bo                    ‗two‘
      3. -pá                    ‗three‘
      4. -bake                  ‗four‘
      5. -atal(e)               ‗five‘
      6. -nerkwa                ‗six‘
      7. -kugle                 ‗seven‘
      8. -pabak(e)              ‗eight‘

     11. -tula-                   ‗twenty‘5.4.1.2 Word order of the number phrase
Unlike English or Spanish, the numeral in Kuna is used after the noun: noun + (prefix + number stem).
Example        nuzha + (kwa- + -bake) = nuzha kwabake               ‗four eggs‘5.4.1.3 Numeral prefixes
In Kuna, you must use one of the many numeral prefixes with the number stem. These prefixes are divided into
four main groups according to how a Kuna perceives the item he is counting, or according to the complexity of
the number:
       1. Group I      Shape of object prefixes
       2. Group II     Complex number-building prefixes
       3. Group III    Measurement-related prefixes
       4. Group IV     Time-related prefixes
In this lesson, Group I and Group II prefixes are discussed; Group III and Group IV prefixes are discussed in
Lesson VII.","[59, 60]"
"12.3 CULTURE
The Kuna culture has a highly developed democratic system. Any adult man or woman has the right to speak at
length on any subject in a town meeting. The protocol of town meetings is quite rigid and it is helpful for the
outsider to be aware of certain rules which Kunas observe in their meetings.
The order in which people speak is strictly adhered to. The order is: village leaders in order of status, older men
(tadgana), younger men (machimala), male outsiders, older women, younger women, female outsiders.
Before the meeting, you are expected to advise the chief, who calls the meeting, of any subject you wish to have
discussed. At that time, you must also discuss any questions the chief might have concerning the subject you
wish discussed.
Normally, the chief will call on you, the outsider, to speak when your item on the agenda is reached. Once you
have presented your case, it is not polite to interrupt another speaker who is speaking to your subject. If you feel
you need to answer a certain objection or correct a misunderstanding, you may ask the chief for permission to
speak again before further discussion takes place.
At the close of the discussion, the chief will announce to you the official acceptance or rejection of your
proposal/request. It is not proper for you, as an outsider, to speak on any subject which does not directly involve
you or the people you represent. Visiting Kunas from outside the community have the same rule imposed upon
them.
If you wish to be excused from a meeting which you are expected to attend, you must inform the chief or the
chowal ibed deputy. He is the person who officially notified you of the time and place of the meeting.",[155]
"2. Problem of adult language learning
A child will learn three or four languages without difficulty. Any new sound, word or grammatical construction
gets added to his repertoire. It will take him a while to separate out the systems of each language entirely. This
he will do provided he is exposed to environments where only one system is present. (Otherwise, he fails and
this leads to the formation of a Creole.)
By adulthood, however, the limited repertoire of sounds, words and grammatical systems of the mother tongue
has become so habitual (automatic) that they have formed almost a closed system. It takes will power,
determination and effort to learn new distinctions, new patterns, and new words. Adults do not enjoy repeating,
repeating and repeating things. But this is what it takes for the new sounds, words, and grammatical patterns to
become automatic. This is the only way to become fluent.
Now, there are ways of making the repetition more palatable, e.g., It is much better to ―become fluent‖ in a
prepared conversation by visiting a dozen homes and saying it in each home, than saying it to yourself twelve
times at your desk. (Besides, hopefully, the people you visit will correct you.)                                                       307
308                                                                                        Language Learning3. Speaking a language
In order to speak a language, you have to ―think‖ that language. You need to ―see‖ in that language and you
need to ―visualize‖ in that language. You should never translate into that language from the mother tongue or
bridge language. To illustrate this, when you see:
                                              Figure 9.
you think ulu, not ―canoe‖.
When you visualize:
                                              Figure 10.
you think An immal amine, not ―I‘m going to hunt.‖
You should never translate ―I‖ as ani, ―am going to‖ as -ne, or ―hunt‖ as ami, because often you will end up
with a mismatch, such as An (omitted) amine in which immal ‗thing, animal‘ has been omitted. It is also very
difficult to translate quickly enough.","[320, 321]"
"     1) From your viewpoint     a) Pride
     It is hard for anyone to be constantly corrected. It‘s humiliating. But you have to put your pride in your
     pocket and take correction.

      Constant correction can be discouraging. However, if you realize and accept the fact that anyone (and that
      includes you) has to be corrected many times before he can reasonably expect to be able to control a
      grammatical construction, then there is no need for discouragement. If the rate of correction is dropping
      for the same construction, then progress is being made and that is nice to know.      c) Being corrected when you are right
      Sometimes you will be corrected when you are sure you are right. Don‘t argue with the person correcting
      you. Make the correction. Most of the time, there is some factor you have either forgotten about or don‘t
      yet know exists. For instance, if the word order suddenly changes, it is probably because of a change of
      focus or emphasis, or the need to keep track of the ―theme‖ or ―topic‖ of the paragraph. Remember, Kunas
      speak the language correctly, even though they may not be able to adequately explain it (even as we
      cannot always adequately explain what is happening in English).","[328, 329]"
"1) Forms of the basic negative word chuli „no‟
        When used alone, the basic negative word chuli ‗no‘ may occur in one of three forms:a) Chul ‗no‘
     Chul ‗no‘ is the most common form of the basic negative word. It is used in response to a question which
     requires a negative answer. In other words, it is used to deny that the action in the question is going to take
     place.

    2. Chul.                       ‗No.‘b) Chuli ‗no‘
     Chuli ‗no‘ is a more emphatic form of the basic negative word and is used as a more emphatic denial in
     response to the same situations for which you would reply with chul ‗no‘.
Examples
    1. ¿Pedro Pucurche ne?                         ‗Is Peter going to Pucuro?‘
    2. ¡Chuli!                                     ‗No!‘c) Chula ‗no‘
     Chula ‗no‘ is a very rare form of the basic negative word. It is used in reference to an action of the past
     and parallels the English construction, ―never, not a chance.‖ It is often used as a response to consistent
     teasing or persistent accusation and gives the response the flavor of ―not only is that not true, it never was
     true either!‖
Examples
    1. ¡An akande, pedin tar chus!                 ‗You took my axe!‘
    2. ¡Chula!                                     ‗No (I did nothing of the kind)!‘2) Basic negative word used in a sentence
      Any form of the basic negative word chul/chuli/chula ‗no‘ may be used in a sentence to deny that an
      adverb or adjective used in the/a previous sentence is valid. In this construction, the sentence is reiterated.
      The subject must be emphasized by the addition of the topic marking suffix -din/-tin or by the use of the
      demonstrative adjective we ‗that‘. A form of the word chul/chuli/chula is used at the end of the sentence
      to negate the adjective/adverb.
Examples
    1. Uade, totó.                                 ‗The fish is small.‘
    2. Uadin, toto chul.95                         ‗The fish is not small.‘

      6. e              ‗his/her/its/their‘13.4.2.2 Possessive suffix -gad/-kad in an equative sentence
Possession in an equative sentence is expressed by saying the object possessed, followed by the noun or
pronoun that refers to the possessor to which the possessive suffix -gad/-kad is attached.
Examples
      1. Achu ankad.          ‗The dog is mine.‘
      2. Achu pabgad.         ‗The dog is father’s.‘
      3. Neg kallingad.       ‗The house is the chicken’s.‘
If ownership is being emphasized the long form of the suffix is used.

A possessive phrase paralleling the English construction ―____ of mine/yours/his/its‖ can be formed by stating
the object possessed, followed by the noun or pronoun that refers to the possessor to which the possessive suffix
-gad/-kad is attached.64

    2. An karta Pedrogad takcha.                 ‗I saw the book of Peter’s.‘13.4.2.4 Possessive questions
Questions of possession are formed by adding the possessive suffix -gad/-kad to a question word.
Examples
    1. ¿Toagad?                   ‗Whose (is it)?‘
    2. ¿Ibigad?                   ‗To what (does it belong?‘13.4.2.5 Extended use of -gad/-kad
-gad/-kad is used in the sense of ‗made of some type of material‘.
Examples
    1. chowalgad                  ‗wooden‘
    2. ezhagad                    ‗made of iron‘
Exercise 4. -gadi/-kadi drill
The teacher asks the question and the student answers the question, selecting an answer from the list below.
Example      Teacher: ¿Achude, toagadi?
             Student: Angadi.
         Answers
      1. an          ‗I‘
      2. mu          ‗older respected lady‘
64
  The variation in word order in which the possessive -gad/-kad form precedes the noun indicates that the focus is on the
possessive word. For example, Ankad ul cheles. ‗(It was) my canoe that was washed away.‘ but Ul ankad cheles. ‗My
canoe was washed away.‘

         5. ¿Toagad esmed, itide?          ‗Whose pot is this?‘13.4.3 Concept of pluralization (Ex. 6–18)
In Kuna, there is not necessarily anything in a noun or in most verbs which would tell you whether it is singular
or plural. Generally speaking, you understand that a noun/verb is singular or plural from the context of the
sentence or from the situation.
In the case of nouns, however, there are two suffixes, -gan(a)/-kan(a) and -mal(a), which are added in certain
situations to indicate that the speaker is referring to more than one individual.
Positional verbs have a plural form and the suffix -mal(a) may be added to a verb to indicate that ―everyone‖ is
included in an action.","[173, 174, 175]"
"14.4.7 Accompaniment suffix -bak/-pak (Ex. 16–19)
In English, the preposition ―with‖ is used to refer to accompaniment. For example, ―I ate fish with
(accompanied by) my wife.‖ or ―I ate fish with (accompanied by) rice.‖ In Kuna, the concept of
accompaniment is rendered by the suffix -bak/-pak attached to the noun. The -bak/-pak form of a word occurs
in the same place in a sentence as an adverb.
Examples
       1. An arozbak ua kucha.                ‗I ate fish with rice.‘
       2. An omebak ua kucha.                 ‗I ate fish with my wife.‘
If an adverb also occurs, one could say: subject + adverb + accompaniment + object + verb.
Example
         An kueye-kueye arosbak ua kucha.           ‗I quickly ate the fish with (my) rice.‘
However, because of information overload (see Section 17), the preferred construction is: subject + adverb +
object + verb + accompaniment.
Example
        An kueye-kueye ua kucha, arosbak.            ‗I quickly ate the fish with my rice.‘
-bak/-pak may also be used to associate the subject or object of the sentence with another person.
Examples
    1. An saglabak ai nued.                  ‗I am a good friend of the chief.‘
    2. Pablo saglabak aichulid.              ‗Paul is an enemy of the chief.‘
    3. Pedro saglabak istargad.              ‗Peter is opposed to the chief.‘
14.4 Grammar                                                                                                      183However, note the following exception in an equative sentence.
     4. Juan saglabakad.                      ‗John is an ally/companion of the chief.‘
Kinship terms are not stated this way, but rather with possessive phrases (see 13.4.2).
Examples
       1. Pablo Juan urpa.                    ‗Paul is John‘s younger brother.‘
       2. Pablo Juan e79 urpa.                ‗Paul is younger brother to John.‘
In a transitive sentence, the accompaniment element is potentially ambiguous, i.e., it might not be clear whether
the additional person is accompanying the subject or the object. Thus, in a sentence such as Juan Pedrobak
machi sakis. ‗John with Peter boy hit.‘ one might wonder whether John and Peter hit the boy, or John hit the
boy and Peter. The ambiguity is normally avoided by a pause after the subject (indicated by a comma) or by
adding the topic marker -din/-tin after the subject.
Examples
    1. Juan, Pedrobak machi sakis.                              ‗John hit the boy and Peter.‘
    2. Juan Pedrobak, machi sakis.                              ‗John and Peter hit the boy.‘
    3. Juandin Pedrobak machi sakis.                            ‗As for John, (he) hit the boy and Peter.‘
    4. Juan Pedrobakdin machi sakis.                            ‗As for John and Peter, (they) hit the boy.‘
Exercise 16. Accompaniment frame drill

The description of an action may be modified by referring to the implement or instrument used to perform the
action, for example, ―with a hammer‖ or ―with a machete.‖ An action also may be described in terms of the
means used to perform it, such as ―by sea‖ or ―by air.‖ The implement/instrument and the means use different
suffixes; the specific suffix -gin/-kin and the general suffix -bal/-pal, respectively. These are additional uses of
the specific and general locative suffixes -gin/-kin and -bal/-pal of Section 8.4.1.","[195, 196, 197]"
"7.3 Culture
In carrying out business, Kunas usually buy and pay for one item at a time. This practice is common in many
parts of the world. The price of sugar, for instance, is discussed and agreed upon. The sugar is paid for, handed
over to the buyer, and any change is given. You are then ready to buy or sell the next item.
As you become more integrated into the Kuna culture, you will occasionally find yourself involved in situations
which are embarrassing to you or to your Kuna associates. One such embarrassing situation is related in
Dialogue 7.1. The villager discovered when he went to pay for some merchandise that he had left his money at
home. A Kuna would feel very embarrassed on discovering his error. The most inoffensive way of handling an
embarrassing situation in a culture other than your own is to ignore the situation and carry on as though nothing
unusual had happened. Avoid using smiles or quips in such situations. People tend to be doubly sensitive to
embarrassment in front of people from another culture. If the embarrassing situation is ignored it is much easier
for the embarrassed party to regain his composure.

     When the topic of conversation is the subject of the sentence, ad(e) ‗he/she/it‘ or amal(a) ‗they‘ is used.
Examples
    1. ¿Ade pia nad?                           ‗Where did he go?‘
    2. Amal pato nanmal.                       ‗They‘ve already left.‘b) Topical non-subject
     When the topic of conversation is not the subject of the sentence, the third-person pronoun tar is used plus
     the appropriate suffix if one is required.
Example        An targa chogzha.               ‗I said to him.‘2) Non-topical third-person pronoun
     When the subject is not the topic, it is possible to leave out the pronouns which refer to the subject.
     Elsewhere in the sentence a non-topic element may be referred to by a pronoun.a) Non-subject, non-topic in the first-person narrative
     In first-person narrative, the third-person pronoun ne accompanied by the appropriate suffix is used
     everywhere in the subject position.
Examples
    1. An ne mecha.              ‗I killed it.‘
    2. An nega chog.             ‗I said to him.‘b) Non-subject, non-topic in third-person narrative
     In third-person narrative, the pronoun te is used to refer to the direct object.
Examples
     1. Pablo te mecha.         ‗Paul killed it (that same one).‘
     2. An te ukcha.            ‗I sold it (that same one).‘
    In the case of the indirect object, the indirect object suffix -ga occurs alone without an accompanying
    pronoun.
Example        Luis ga chogal.                 ‗Louis began to say to him.‘3) Continuity of paragraph topic
     The topic of a conversation (discourse) tends to occur as the subject of the sentences throughout the
     paragraphs that make up the conversation. Sometimes, however, the topic of the conversation becomes the
     direct or indirect object of a sentence. In English, the passive voice is used to indicate that the topic in that
     particular sentence is not the actor, ―John was hit by a car.‖
      In Kuna, when the topic of the conversation becomes the direct/indirect object of one of the sentences, it is
      placed in the first position of the sentence and there is a slight pause before the remainder of the utterance
      is said. The third person pronoun tar accompanied by the appropriate suffix occurs in the object position.
Example      Juan, achu tar kucha.          ‗John was bitten by the dog.‘
    When the topic of a paragraph is not the topic of the conversation nor the subject in a given sentence, it is
    placed at the beginning of the sentence followed by a slight pause; there is no pronoun in the
    object/indirect object position.

In Kuna, a third-person pronoun can only be used once or twice before the noun to which the pronoun refers
must be repeated. Where ambiguity could arise, the noun is preceded by te ‗that same‘ to ensure that the listener
realizes the reference is to the same person/object as before.
Example
               Ome noni. Te omedina, Luis e nan itos.                ‗A woman arrived. That same woman (is) Louis‘
                                                                     mother (you) understand.‘20.4.1.3 Subject in indirect speech
In indirect speech, the person being quoted is referred to by the pronoun ede or e plus the appropriate suffix.
The suffix -chog/-zhog/-jog attaches to the verb which describes the action of the person under discussion (see
15.4.3).
Examples
    1. Ede nejog.                                                ‗(He) said (that) he is going.‘
    2. Sagla chog Pedro, ede ne(jog).                            ‗The chief said that Peter was going.‘20.4.2 First-person exclusive subject pronoun
The first-person exclusive pronoun nan121 is used by the speaker to refer to himself and those accompanying
him in an action, but to exclude the people/person to whom he is speaking. When the addressee is included, the
suffix -mal is added to the first-person pronoun an.
Examples
    1. Nanmal pato mas kucha.                          ‗We (not you) already ate the food.‘
    2. Anmal pato mas kucha.                           ‗We (including you) already ate the food.‘20.4.3 Demonstratives
Demonstratives are used to point out a person/thing to whom/which the speaker is referring, in a manner similar
to the English demonstratives ―this‖ and ―that.‖
In Kuna, they may be used in isolation as pronouns or as adjectives preceding the noun to which they refer; or
they may be suffixed and function as adverbs. They have a restricted use in discourse situations.
There are four demonstrative pronouns in Kuna: iti, we, a and te. Iti ‗this‘ and we ‗that‘ are used to refer to
people/things that are within seeing distance of the speaker (in the speaker‘s presence), a ‗that‘ refers to a
person/thing outside the speaker‘s setting (presence), and te ‗that same‘ is used to reinforce a back reference
and confirm that the same person/object is being referred to as was previously mentioned.
The demonstratives frequently occur at the beginning of a sentence, since the item they refer to is often topic.
Examples
    1. Iti (mol) an pakne.                                           ‗I am going to buy this (blouse) (which is right here).‘
    2. We (mol) an pakchul.                                          ‗I won‘t buy that (blouse) (over there).‘
    3. A (tule) odurtalegenab.                                       ‗That person (who is not here) should be punished.‘
    4. ... ¿Ibi nika tede?                                           ‗... What‘s wrong with that (person about whom we
                                                                     have been talking)?‘
        5.     Pe iti uko.                                           ‗Sell this.‘121
      The final n of nan is fortis nn but is written as a single letter by convention (see 2.2.3.4 footnote 8).
276                                                                                                      Classifications20.4.3.1 Demonstrative adjectives
A demonstrative used as an adjective precedes the noun to which it refers. Often this person/item is not only
topic, but is also being singled out or contrasted with another. In this case, the noun is suffixed with the topic
marker -tin/-din (see Appendix E).
Examples
    1. Iti moldin nued.                                ‗This blouse (is) good.‘
    2. We esdin nugal nika.                            ‗This machete (is) sharp.‘
    3. Pe we tulega chogo.                             ‗Tell that person (over there).‘20.4.3.2 Demonstrative adverbs
The locative suffixes -gin/-kin and -bal/-pal (see Section 8.4) may be attached to any of the demonstrative
pronouns to give the connotation of a narrow or broad setting adverb.
Examples
    1. Es itigin mellemai.                             ‗The machete is (lying around) right here.‘
    2. Es wegin mellemai.                              ‗The machete is (lying around) right over there.‘
    3. Es webal mellemai.                              ‗The machete is (lying around) somewhere over there.‘20.4.3.3 Forward and backward reference to demonstration
The suffix -ob122 may be added to the demonstrative pronouns we ‗that‘ and te ‗that same‘ to express a concept
similar to the English ―like that‖ or ―in that manner‖.
Weob ‗like this‘ is used to refer forward to what is going to be said or demonstrated, or to what has just been
demonstrated. Teob ‗like that‘ is used to refer backwards to what was said.
Examples
    1. Weob be imako.                  ‗Do it like this.‘
    2. Teob be imako.                  ‗Do it like that (as I told you).‘20.4.3.4 Specific use of we and a in discourse
During a conversation or speech, that is to say, in discourse and in a written text, the demonstrative pronoun we
‗that‘ is used as an adjective before the noun plus suffix -din/-tin to refer to the topic under discussion.
Non-topic people/things are referred to by the demonstrative pronoun a ‗that‘ before the noun. Te ‗that same‘ is
used to refer to a previously mentioned non-topic item where ambiguity might arise from the use of several
successive third-person pronouns. In such cases, the listener might understand the speaker to be introducing
other actors/objects into the story.
Examples
    1. We tuledin, tule nued.                          ‗That person (about whom we are speaking) is a good person.‘
   2a. Machidin yannu takcha.                          ‗The boy saw a peccary.‘
    b. A yannudin igalgin mellemai.                    ‗That peccary was sprawled out on the trail.‘
    c. Te yannudin purkwis, takcha.                    ‗That same peccary was dead, (you) see.‘20.4.4 Indefinite and indeterminate pronouns20.4.4.1 Indefinite pronouns
The third-person pronoun amal ‗they‘ (see 1.4.2 and 8 4.3) may be used to refer to unknown or unspecified
people.122
      -ob(i) is a contracted form of -yob(i) ‗like‘ (see 19.4.12.3).

Example
           Kwentin ua kumpi; kwentin chuga.             ‗Some (a group) want to eat fish; some (want to eat)
                                                        crab.‘
                                 123
g. kwentin ... piddin/pimaladdin ‗some ... others ...‘ is usually used in a situation of a more marked contrast
between two parts of a group than is referred to by kwentin ... kwentin ‗some ... ; some ...‘.
Example
        Kwentin ua kumpi tenal pimaladdin chul.             ‗Some want to eat fish while others don‘t.‘

Example
        Tule nikchulchal mani               ‗Almost no people have money. (Almost no one has money.)‘
Another way of excluding the entire group is with the expression nikchul ‗not one‘.
Example
       Tule kwen nikchul pe pentagal.                     ‗There is not a single person to help you.‘20.4.6 Reflexive pronouns
In Kuna, as in English, reflexive pronouns are used to indicate that an actor is doing an action to
himself/herself/itself. Reflexive pronouns are also used in a construction which indicates volition. There are two
reflexive pronouns: naga ‗myself‘ and aga ‗yourself/himself/herself/itself‘ and these follow the noun or
pronoun referring to the subject of the sentence.
Examples
    1. Antin naga chikcha.                      ‗I cut myself.‘
    2. ¿Pedin aga chikcha?                      ‗Did you cut yourself?‘
    3. Machi aga chikcha.                       ‗The boy cut himself.‘20.4.6.1 Group marker with reflexive pronoun
When a reflexive pronoun is used to refer to a group of people/things who are doing the action to themselves,
the group marker -mal (see 13.4.3) is added to the noun or pronoun which refers to the participants. It is also
added to the verb.
123
   kwentin, piddin and pimaladdin are formed by adding the topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin to an indefinite pronoun
stem.
20.4 Grammar                                                                                                        279Examples
      1. Anmal naga pezhe chikchamal.                 ‗We (including you) cut ourselves badly.‘
      2. Nanmal naga chikchamal.                      ‗We (excluding you) cut ourselves.‘
      3. ¿Pemal aga chikchamal?                       ‗Did you (plural) cut yourselves?‘
      4. Machimal aga chikchamal.                     ‗The boys cut themselves.‘
When the people in the group are acting reciprocally, i.e., doing the action to each other, the actors are stated
with the group marker -mal. The third-person reflexive pronoun is followed by the repeated third-person
pronoun which has the group marker -mal. The verb also has the group marker -mal added.
Examples
     1. ¿Pemal aga emal-emal chikchamal?                 ‗Did you cut each other?‘
     2. Machimal aga emal-emal chikchamal.               ‗The boys cut each other.‘
     3. Tulemal aga emal-emal chogalmal pede             ‗The people said among themselves that you were a
           tule nued.                                    good person.‘
When there are two actors acting one toward the other, the third-person reflexive pronoun is used. It is followed
by the second participant in the action to which the accompaniment suffix -bak/-pak has been added. The group
marker suffix -mal is added to the verb.
Example       Pun aga machibak sakismal. ‗The girl and boy hit each other.‘20.4.6.2 Volition
The Kuna construction which parallels the English phrase, ―of his own volition,‖ is expressed by using the
appropriate reflexive pronoun followed by tukin (see 20.4.8).
Examples
    1. An naga tukin nad.                     ‗I went myself (of my own free will).‘
    2. Machi aga tukin es pakcha.             ‗The boy bought the machete himself (of his own volition).‘20.4.7 Affirmation20.4.7.1 Contrastive affirmation
A speaker may affirm one idea/action in contrast with another. For example, in the case of ―the youth doesn‘t
know how to make a canoe, but the elder does,‖ the (village) elder‘s skill is affirmed in contrast to the youth‘s
lack of experience. This concept is expressed in Kuna by the contrastive affirmation suffix -diji/-tiji.
Example
           Machi wichul ul chob tenal taddiji.             ‗The youth doesn‘t know how to make a canoe but the
                                                           elder does.‘20.4.7.2 Emphatic affirmation
In English, a speaker may affirm that it was indeed the subject who did the action by stressing a reflexive
pronoun which refers to the actor or he may affirm the carrying out of the verb by stressing the verb itself. The
verb may also be affirmed by the use of an adverb such as ―really, truly, indeed.‖
In Kuna, the subject may be affirmed by adding the affirmation suffix -d(e)/-t(e) to the first-person and
second-person pronoun subject and -de/-te to nouns referring to all other subjects. It may also be affirmed by
the use of the adverb chunnad ‗(it was) really (I/you/he/we/they)‘.
Examples
    1. Annid takcha.                          ‗I saw (it) myself.‘
    2. ¿Ped takcha?                           ‗Did you see (it) yourself?‘
    3. Machide takcha.                        ‗The boy saw it himself.‘
    4. Ade takcha.                            ‗He saw (it) himself.‘
280                                                                                                   Classifications      5. An chunnad takcha.                 ‗(It was) really I (who) saw (it).‘
The action may be affirmed by adding the affirmation suffix -de/-te to the verb or by using the adverb
chunchunnad ‗really/actually‘.
Examples
    1. Anid takchade.                          ‗I myself saw (it).‘
    2. ¿Pe takchade?                           ‗You saw (it)?‘
    3. An chunchunnad takcha.                  ‗I really saw (it).‘20.4.8 Contrary-to-fact (Ex. 5)
To this point in the discussion of Kuna grammar, most situations have been likely to come to pass or did,
indeed, happen. There are times, however, when one needs to use expressions which parallel the English
construction ‗had ... happened (although it did not)‘ or ‗I wish ... had happened (but it didn‘t)‘. Such situations
are called condition contrary-to-fact or hypothetical situations. An example of an English contrary-to-fact
sentence is, ―Had I gone, I would have gotten wet.‖ This is contrary-to-fact because the person did not go and
did not get wet.
In Kuna, a condition contrary-to-fact sentence is formed by adding the contrary-to-fact suffix -n to the verbs in
both the conditional and main clauses of a conditional sentence (see 14.4.5). Various shades of meaning are
indicated by the use of different aspects and tenses in the main and subordinate clauses.
Many contrary-to-fact constructions are rare. For the purpose of this discussion, general principles are given to
guide in the construction of contrary-to-fact expressions, and some of the more commonly-used constructions
are listed by way of example. 12420.4.8.1 General principles used in construction of more common contrary-to-fact sentences

The English concept of wishing is expressed in Kuna by the use of a contrary-to-fact conditional clause
accompanied by the adverb nabirin ‗it would be good‘ in the main clause. This construction basically parallels
the English expression ―It would be nice to/for ...‖ or ―I wish for/to ...‖. As in English, the Kuna optative
construction is used in situations which are much less likely to materialize than are situations which employ the
desiderative suffix -bi/-pi ‗to want to ...‘ (see Section 2.4.2).
Examples
    1. An motor pin nikalen, nabirin.                    ‗I wish I had a new motor. (Lit.: If I were to have a
                                                         new motor, it would be good.)‘
     2. An motor pin nikujalen, nabirin.                 ‗I wish I had had a new motor. (Lit.: If I had had a new
                                                         motor, it would have been good.)‘
     3. An mas kuchalen, nabirin.                        ‗I wish had eaten. (Lit.: If I had eaten it would have
                                                         been nice.)‘
The optative construction is also used to wish something for someone else and parallels the English
construction, ―May you....‖
Examples
    1. Pe nugujalen, nabirin.                                       ‗May you get well.‘
    2. Pab Tummad be nugu takelen, nabirin.                         ‗May God bless you. (Lit.: It would be well if God
                                                                    would look well on you.)‘20.4.8.4 “Almost, but not quite”
An event which almost transpired, but did not, is described by using the immediate future suffix -ne followed
by the contrary-to-fact suffix -n.
Examples
    1. Machi iche napi purkwenen.                     ‗The boy almost died.‘
    2. Mu aglenen.                                    ‗The old woman almost fell.‘20.4.9 Past perfect aspect suffix -n
The past perfect aspect parallels the English construction, ―he had previously finished eating,‖ in contrast to the
completive aspect which parallels, ―he finished eating.‖ The past perfect is formed by adding the suffix -n after
the completive suffix. This -n should be distinguished carefully from the one occurring in contrary-to-fact
constructions (see 20.4.8).
Example
         Amal iktual pato mas kuchan.                     ‗They had already eaten beforehand.‘
Note that with the positional verbs nai, mai, ti, etc., the perfective form with -n means that the position has
since terminated. In the case of the suffix form -nai, -di/-ti, etc., the action in progress has since terminated.
Examples
    1. ¿Pia pe tin?                                   ‗Where had you been?‘
    2. Pabdin main.                                   ‗Father had been home.‘
    3. An mas kunnain.                                ‗I had been eating.‘
126
      In this irregular case, the final n of nabirin becomes d before the suffix -din.
20.4 Grammar                                                                                                               28320.4.10 Probability/possibility
Events, actions, and people/things may be described in terms of probabilities or possibilities.
If an event is probably true/going to happen, the suffix -chulchi/-julchi ‗Is it not?‘ is added to the verb of the
main sentence.
Examples
      1. ¿Pe nejulchi?                      ‗You are going, are you not?‘
      2. ¿Pabdin nadchulchi?                ‗Father went, did he not?‘
When an action or noun (phrase) is described as a probability, the suffix -dewa/-tewa127 is added to the verb or
noun (phrase).
Examples
      1. ¿Pe anka immal chedodewa?                     ‗Will you probably bring something for me?‘
      2. An manigin uknedewa.                          ‗I‘m probably going to sell (it) for money.‘
      3. An mol pakne; kinniddewa.                     ‗I‘m going to buy cloth; probably red cloth.‘
If something is a possibility and by no means certain, the suffix -dowa/-towa ‗possibly‘ is added to the
appropriate verb or noun (phrase).
Examples
    1. ¿Pe mol paknedowa?                                ‗Are you perhaps/possibly going to buy blouses?‘
    2. An Pedro panamabal takodowa.                      ‗I will perhaps see Peter in Panama.‘
    3. An wichi toa sagla palmine; Pedrodowa.            ‗I don‘t know whom the chief is going to send, Peter
                                                         perhaps.‘
The suffix -wa is also added to question words to indicate possibility.
Examples
    1. ¿Pia?                       ‗Where?‘
    2. ¿Inkwa?                     ‗When?‘
    3. ¿Ibi?                       ‗What?‘
    4. ¿Piawa?                     ‗Where could it (possibly) be?‘
    5. ¿Inkwawa?                   ‗When could it (possibly) happen?‘
    6. ¿Ibiwa?                     ‗What‘s wrong? (Lit.: What possibly?)‘20.4.11 Alternatives
The stating of alternatives in Kuna is complex: both of the alternatives are stated. Several ways are used to
express alternatives.","[286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296]"

  Here and throughout this grammar, where no subject is overtly indicated by a noun or pronoun, an appropriate pronoun is
supplied. In another context, it might be a different one.

     9. pak          ‗to buy‘
    10. tig          ‗to plant‘4.4.3.2 Topic-establishing questions
The topic of a question is the person or thing to whom/which the question refers. It is very important in Kuna
that the topic of a question be clear. If the person or thing to whom/which the question refers is not presently
being talked about, or if the topic is not obvious, it must be stated before the question itself. If the topic of a
question is obscure and it is not stated, the listener may not understand the question.
For example, if you suddenly ask, ―Where is he going?,‖ your listener will invariably reply, ―Where is who
going?‖ By asking this question, the listener has tried to establish the topic of your question. In other words, the
topic of the question was unclear. Once the listener has understood the topic, he will answer the question. Three
things must be kept in mind in using topic-establishing questions: the intonation pattern of the question, the
order of the sentence, and the form of the topic.","[53, 54]"
"         Setting
        When you wish to orient your listener as to ―when‖ an event took place or will take place, the time
        expression occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
Example          Sae an karpa chobzha.           ‗Yesterday I made a basket.‘          Connectives
        If you choose to organize your story chronologically, thus, developing the story around the time certain
        events happened/will happen, time expressions become the ―glue‖ that holds the story together. The time
        expression is the connective which joins one thought or sentence to the former one. If the time expression
        is a connective, it occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
Example
             Martesgin59 anmal noni. Pangin anmal            ‗Tuesday we arrived. The next day we went hunting
             immal aminade.                                  (animals).‘
58
     b becomes m before n, for example: chob + -ne = chomne ‗going to make‘.
59
     Days of the week are Spanish loan words. Tummi ‗Sunday‘ is a Kuna term whose primary meaning is ‗week‘.
12.4 Grammar                                                                                                      147      Answers to questions
     Time expressions used to answer time-related questions such as: ¿Inkwa? ‗When?‘ occur at the beginning
     of the sentence.
Examples
    1. ¿Inkwa pe ne?            ‗When are you going?‘
    2. Pan an ne.               ‗I am going tomorrow.‘      Topic
     When the time expression is the topic of the conversation, it occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
Examples
    1. Pan an ne.                                         ‗Tomorrow I am going (referring to what the person
                                                          plans to do tomorrow).‘
     2.    Ai yegualil an ina che.                        ‗When a friend becomes sick, I give him his
                                                          medicine.‘      Contrast of time of distinct events
     Occasionally, a situation arises in that an event that happened (will happen) in one time period is
     contrasted with what happened (will happen) in another time period. When the time of distinct events are
     contrasted, the time expressions occur at the beginning of the two sentences describing the events.
Example
          Pandin an aros tigne. Achuldin an ua            ‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to plant rice. The day after
          makne.                                          tomorrow (on the other hand), I‘m going to spear
                                                          fish.‘b) Time expressions used after the subject
     If a time expression is used as an adverb to limit the scope of the action by stating when it took place (or
     will take place), the time expression occurs after the subject of the sentence. This parallels the time
     expression occurring after the verb in English, ―I will go at 3 o‘clock.‖
Example       Antin pan ne.                 ‗I am going tomorrow.‘
    If there is more than one adverbial expression occurring after the subject, the time expression occurs
    immediately following the subject. This word order is different from English word order.
Example       Antin pan negzhe ne.            ‗I am going home tomorrow.‘
Exercise 10. Time frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: An pan negzhe ne.
              Student: An pan negzhe ne.
     1.    An pan negzhe ne.                              ‗I am going home tomorrow.‘
     2.    An sae akan pakcha.                            ‗I bought an axe yesterday.‘
     3.    Sagla immis noni.                              ‗The chief arrived today/just now.‘
     4.    An achul ob tigne.                             ‗I am going to plant corn day after tomorrow.‘
     5.    Machi asto kueye- kueye koe mecha.             ‗The boy quickly killed the deer the day before
                                                          yesterday.‘Exercise 11. Time expression substitution drill
The teacher says the frame and selects a time expression. The student then inserts the time expression in the
correct form of the frame.

      Frame An ____ wag takcha.              ‗I saw the outsider ____.‘
                An ____ wag takne.           ‗I am going to see the outsider ____.‘

       7. immis                ‗now (referring to past or future)‘c) Time expressions at the end of a sentence
     Occasionally a time expression occurs at the end of a sentence in the postpredicate position (see 17.4) The
     time expression in this position is being emphasized by the speaker.
Example
       Machi nakwal ua makne, pane.                          ‗The boy is going to spear fish upriver tomorrow.‘12.4.1.2 Relating an event to another event (Ex. 12–26)
As indicated (see 7.4.1.4), the time of an event may be referred to by an exact time, for example, wachilbo ‗two
o‘clock‘. It may also be referred to by using an adverb of time, sae ‗yesterday‘, or a complex time word
ibabakegus ‗four days ago‘ (see 7.4.1.4). Another way of referring to the time of an event (Event A) is by
referring to the time of another event (Event B), that is known to the listener. That other event (Event B), may
be referred to by use of a time-reference suffix or time conjunction, or by means of prior condition suffixes.","[159, 160, 161]"
"2. Keep others talking
In learning Kuna, an important part of the process is ―listen, listen, listen.‖a. Reason
This is useful in several ways:
1. Hearing the language in its natural context gives good reliable correlation between the situation and the
   appropriate intonation, grammar and vocabulary.
2. You increase your ability to divide up a torrent of speech into meaningful pieces so that you understand
   what is being said.
3. You increase your ability to visualize the situation under discussion without having to go through some
   intermediate language.
4. Constantly hearing the intonation and grammatical patterns tends to reinforce them in your own mind.
5. Hearing a word used in different contexts helps define the area of meaning of a word, e.g., neg is found to
   mean ―house or building.‖ It is also used to refer to the ―village‖ (as opposed to the surrounding
   countryside) or a ―field.‖ It is also used as a ―place‖ in general.b. Problem
The problem is that in Kuna, like most languages, you have to show your interest in what is being said by
responding in the appropriate way, or the person will feel that you aren‘t interested and stop talking. In Kuna,
this is done by so-called conversation sustainers such as mmmm, ajáj, or repeating the last important phrase
of what was being said. These conversation sustainers should be used right from the beginning, starting with the
more simple neutral ones such as mmmm and injecting them at random until you can distinguish the
appropriate places to use them.",[324]
"9.4.1 Word order of a noun phrase (Ex. 4–5)
A noun phrase may consist of a noun, adjective and suffix, or of a noun modifying another noun.",[117]
"3.4.5.1 Change of subject
A common use of the change of subject suffix is the exchange of greetings. One person may ask, ―How are
you?‖ Then the other person answers, ―I am fine. How are you?‖ In this case, the you refers back to the first
speaker. The subject of the dialogue has changed. A Kuna speaker would signal such a change of subject by the
use of the suffix -din.
Example
       Visitor :           ¿Pe igi oipos?           ‗How are you this morning?‘
       Villager:           Ampala. ¿Pedin?          ‗So-so. And you?‘3.4.5.2 Contrast of subject
Kunas also use the suffix -din/-tin to mark a contrast between what two subjects are doing.
Example             Machidin ua makne.                 ‗On the one hand, the boy is going to spear fish.‘
                    Omedin ua tune.                    ‗On the other hand, the woman is going to cook fish.‘

    Helps for distinguishing between short and long fortis consonants at the end of words are given in 4.2.2.

    -din becomes -tin after a fortis consonant.

4.1 Dialogue
Question words are extremely useful in finding your way among strangers in a new place. When you have only
partial control of the language, you can question someone until you fully understand what they have been
saying. By fully using the question words—several of which are included in Dialogue 4.1—you can continue a
conversation for a reasonable time, even though you have very little control of the language. They also help the
language learner to become better acquainted with the language and culture.

4.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2)
In section 3.2.3 the intonation pattern of questions requiring yes/no answers is discussed. Other types of
questions are discussed in this lesson (see 4.4.3 for grammatical explanations). Become familiar with the correct
intonation of questions by doing the following exercises.15
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 4.1 by humming the intonation. Pay special attention to acknowledgement of the
answer to a question.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 4.1, formulating the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1) slowing
down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.","[44, 45, 46]"

    When the topic is established with the suffix -din(a) (see Appendix E), the unsuffixed noun or pronoun is often repeated
in the main body of the sentence.

       An ul pakcha, ul tummadi.              ‗I bought a canoe, the big canoe.‘7) Listing
     In general, for each item in a list the long form is used, except for the last item where the short form occurs
     if such exists (see 5.4.2).
Example
       Antin immal pakcha: mola, iko, tegine tub.           ‗I bought some things: cloth, needles, and thread.‘8) Hesitation
    When a person hesitates, in order to recall a forgotten word or name, the long form of the word is used
    (see 17.4.1.3 and 17.4.2.4).
Example
       Antin iwen takcha, iwenna ... Pedro.            ‗I saw what‘s-his-name, ah-ah-ah ... Peter.‘

               APPENDIX E: TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
1. Establishing the topic
The suffix -de/-te is used to establish or set the topic of a conversation. When a situation is obvious, two people
can start talking about it without setting the topic of the conversation. For example, if a person arrives limping,
the other person is likely to ask, ―What happened?‖ He does not need to say something like, ―Concerning your
limping, ...‖ in order to get the conversation focused on the person‘s sore leg. The situation makes the nature of
the opening question obvious. Often, however, a person wishes to start talking about something that is not
obvious, or about a topic which has not been mentioned earlier in the conversation. Possibly he wishes to ask
about someone who is not present. The person who is starting to talk about a new topic adds the suffix -de/-te to
the item or name of the person which is now in focus.
Examples
      1. ¿Pedrode, pia nad?                  ‗And concerning Peter, where did he go?‘
      2. ¿Masde, igi mani?                   ‗And concerning plantains, how much are they?‘
A common use of -de is in the greeting, tegidde ‗So what‘s new with you?‘ In this case, the topic is changed to
the person who is arriving.
The affected object suffix -ga/-ka (see 10.4.8) may be added to the -de/-te form when appropriate.
Example       Antega, an weli.                ‗As for me, I‘m happy.‘2. Progression of topic
In conversation, a speaker generally moves from one aspect (stage) of a subject to another. For example, in
selling, the salesman and buyer might first discuss the price. Once the price has been settled, he will move on to
discuss the time the goods are to be delivered. The suffix -de/-te serves to mark the point at which the
conversation progresses from one point to the next point (stage). The speaker often marks the end of one stage
of the conversation by saying nabirde ‗okay‘. Nabirde ‗okay‘ is formed by adding the topic marker -de/-te to
the word nabir ‗fine‘. It is similar to the English expression, ―Fine. Now then about the ...‖. That is to say,
-de/-te is used to indicate that one part (stage) of the topic (price) has been handled, and we are now ready to
discuss the next part of the arrangement (time of delivery of the goods).","[303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"
"      3) Relationships
      After dealing with pressing problems, work through a list of universal grammatical relationships139 and see
      which ones you can handle. Next, make a list of what would appear to be the most useful for you to use.
      Then use this as a basis for your investigation.e. Process
Plan for the following stages in investigation:
1. gather data
2. hypothesize (guess what the grammar rule is)
3. check your hypothesis

There are several books which adequately deal with this subject and it is beyond my purpose here to deal
extensively with this subject. However, there are two cardinal rules worth repeating:a. Write it down
When you gather information (language data), write it down. Otherwise, you (in common with humankind) will
forget it.b. Filing
The information written down must be filed in such a way as you can readily ―find‖ it.c. Rate
Don’t gather information faster than you can digest (process) it, or it will drown you. For example, don‘t sit
down and gather 100 new words. Just take 5–10 new words, write them down, check their meaning, learn them
and use them. Then, and only then, gather another 5–10 new words or one grammatical device and assimilate
that.

"14.4.4.1 Irregular response to habitual aspect condition
When the response to the habitual aspect condition is irregular, an appropriate adverb is used to modify the verb
in the independent sentence. Appropriate adverbs include: tigujal ‗usually‘, impagin ‗often‘ and impakwa
‗seldom/rarely‘.77
     -alil is made up of the inceptive aspect -ali plus the prior conditional suffix -l (see 12.4.1.b).
14.4 Grammar                                                                                                              179Examples

      2.    An ai yegualil, an impagin ina che.                 ‗When my friend gets sick, I often administer medicine.‘

                                                                medicine.‘14.4.4.2 Regular response to habitual aspect condition (Ex. 11)
When the response to the habitual aspect condition is regular, the nominalized form of the verb stem in the
conditional clause is followed by the appropriate adverbs. The shape of the adverb (with the exception of ―every
time‖) varies according to the appropriate number stem used. For example, ilbal ‗every time‘, il-ilbogin ‗every
second (other) time‘, and il-ilpagin ‗every third time‘.
Examples
    1. An ai yegued ilbal, an ina che.                          ‗Every time my friend gets sick, I administer
                                                                medicine.‘
      2.    An machi uged il-ilbogin, nono pirpirma.            ‗Every other time my son has a fever, he gets dizzy
                                                                (lit.: his head wanders).‘Exercise 11. Habitual aspect condition drill
The teacher selects a sentence below and says it. The student substitutes the sentence in the frame.
Example       Teacher: Machered mas emis.
              Student: Machered mas emijad ilbal, adin ukul nika.
     Frame ____-d ilbal, adin ukul nika. ‗Every time ____, he/she is hungry/thirsty.‘
      1. Machered mas emis.              ‗The man cleared the plantains.‘
      2. Machi ua makti.                 ‗The boy speared fish.‘
      3. Pun mas tus.                    ‗The girl cooked food.‘
      4. Ome neg turwis.                 ‗The woman swept the house.‘
      5. Tad neg chobzha.                ‗The elder built/worked on a house.‘14.4.5 Conditional with –le (Ex. 12)
A conditional sentence parallels the English construction ―If..., then....‖ It is constructed by adding the suffix -le
to the long form of the verb stem or to the suffixed verb in the conditional clause. This construction is used
when the speaker is uncertain whether or not a condition will be fulfilled.
Examples
    1. An mol pakele, an pega uko.                              ‗If I buy cloth, I‘ll give (it) to you.‘
    2. Anmal yannu makmalale, anmal wis chan                    ‗If we shoot a peccary, we will give you a little meat,
         pega ukmogo.78                                         too.‘Exercise 12. Conditional -le frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc.
Example       Teacher: An mol pakele, an mol kinnid pako.
              Student: An mol pakele, an mol kinnid pako.
      1. An mol pakele, an mol kinnid pako.       ‗If I buy cloth, I‘ll buy red (cloth).‘
      2. An ul ukele, an ul toto uko.             ‗If I sell a canoe, I‘ll sell the small one.‘
78
  The indirect object pega occurs after the direct object chan in this example, in order to focus more attention on the one
receiving the meat than on the meat itself.

      4. An mas kunnele, an arri chan kunno.            ‗If I eat (food), I‘ll eat iguana meat.‘
      5. Pe chapurbal neele, an bebak nao.              ‗If you go to the jungle, I‘ll go with you.‘14.4.6 Purpose suffix -gal/-kal (Ex. 13–15)
The purposive suffix -gal/-kal is added to the verb stem of a purpose clause in order to express the purpose for
the action of the independent sentence. It may also be added to certain verbs to form a noun which serves as the
tool with which to perform the action of the verb.
There are three types of purpose clauses; a straightforward explanation of the purpose of the action in the main
clause, a reference to the event that it is hoped will be precipitated by the action in the main clause, and a
reference to the event which it is hoped will be prevented by the action in the main clause.","[191, 192, 193]"
"     5) Use of texts
     Increased fluency and naturalness can be acquired by memorizing short texts. A text may be a
     conversation (dialogue) between two people or a single person (monologue) telling of an event or
     expressing an opinion on a subject.
     The language learner will find it very helpful to use a short text that deals with his surroundings or
     situation and to visiting throughout the village using the memorized text with the people he meets. He
     should write out the text he plans to use. He may develop it from a short conversation that he has
     heard/recorded. He should read the text aloud to a close Kuna friend who is willing to check it for
     accuracy before it is memorized.
     The following guidelines in text making may prove helpful:
     1. The text should be short! Early texts for the purpose of memorization should be no more than three or
        four exchanges. After some degree of fluency is achieved, the texts may be lengthened.
     2. The subject matter should be relevant to your situation.
     3. The text should be as natural as possible. The ideal source is a type of spontaneous conversation
        between two people.
     4. Intonation should always be learned first. Individual sounds, meanings of words or grammatical
        constructions are secondary.
     5. After the text has been mastered and used several times in a natural situation, the language learner
        should start substituting other vocabulary items, a few at a time, making sure the intonation pattern and
        speed are maintained.
     6. Once substitution has been mastered, try jotting down several pieces of information about a single
        subject. Organize the information into a single text. Be sure to check the text you develop with a Kuna
        friend who is willing to check your text for naturalness and accuracy.
     7. Use one text type at a time (see Section 20.4.12).",[328]
"2. Expanding your knowledge of Kuna
It is helpful if you can use Kuna as soon as possible to further your knowledge of the language. In order to do
this, there are certain expressions that need to be memorized right away.a. Language learning expressions     1) Speaking Kuna
 1. An wichul tule kakpal chunma.         ‗I don‘t know how to speak Kuna.‘

      This is the most common and easiest way of getting information, whether in a formal language session or
      a casual contact. However, you need to follow up on your first question: e.g., if you saw a pig and asked,
      ¿Ibi wede? ‗What is that?‘ then if feasible, you should follow it up with a whole string of questions, such
      as:
  2. ¿Ibi kun?                           ‗What does it eat?‘
  3. ¿Pia mai?                           ‗Where does it live?‘
  4. ¿Toagad?                            ‗Whose is it?‘
  5. ¿Ibi chenai?                        ‗What is it doing?‘
  6. ¿Igi talde, igi pe ebinzhe?         ‗What do you think, how does it look?‘
      This type of questioning will do several things for you:
      1. It may produce new vocabulary.
      2. It will reinforce old vocabulary.
      3. It will help you determine the usage of words. You will discover that chickens don‘t kun ‗eat‘ food but
         that they ma ‗peck‘ food.
      4. It will help you build up vocabulary according to topic (according to semantic field). This means that
         you will become familiar with many of the words associated with ―pigs‖ in the above example. That
         means that the next time you are out on a walk, you will not only be able to comment ¡Pe take, china!
         ‗Look, pigs!‘ but you will be able also to comment on their size, color, activity, likes and dislikes, what
         they taste like, etc.
      5. By using the new word in several questions, you will learn it.","[326, 327]"
"1) Subject omitted from simple sentence and stated in postpredicate position in answer to question
     One situation in which the subject is omitted in the main part of the sentence and stated in the
     postpredicate position is in answer to a question. If the replier wishes to emphasize the subject as he
     replies to a question, he may do so by omitting it in the main part of the sentence and stating it,
     accompanied by the suffix -din/-tin, in the postpredicate position.
Examples
   1a. ¿Pia pe ne?                             ‗Where are you going?‘
    b. Chapurbal ne; antin.                    ‗I am going to the jungle.‘
   2a. ¿Piade?                                 ‗Where (is he)?‘
    b. Nad; Luisdin.                           ‗Louis, went.‘2) Subject omitted from simple sentence and stated in postpredicate position in storytelling
     Another situation in which the subject is omitted from the main part of the sentence, but occurs in the
     postpredicate position is in the midst of the narration of a story or a tale of activities. This situation is
     dictated by the rules of storytelling and discourse structure. In a story, when the subject is omitted in the
     main part of the sentence and stated in the postpredicate position, it is accompanied by the topic marking
     suffix -de/-te (see Appendix E).

On a peccary hunt, the hunters had tried to head off the animals and to arrive at another point before the animals
did. On their arrival at the expected meeting place, they discover...
      1. Pato nas; yannude.                             ‗The peccaries have already gone by.‘
      2. Mutik, nakwal chule amine, machide.            ‗Tonight the boy is going to hunt paca upriver.‘18.4.5.2 Direct object stated in main clause, and only adjective stated in the postpredicate
            position
When the speaker wishes to highlight/clarify an evaluation of a direct object, only the direct object is stated in
the main clause and only the adjective is stated in the postpredicate position. In other words, when the speaker
wishes to give his opinion of the object, its relative size, quantity or relative weight, etc., only the adjective
occurs in the postpredicate position. All adjectives are not of an evaluatory nature. Those which are not
evaluatory (e.g., colors) may not occur alone in the postpredicate position.
If the evaluatory adjective is descriptive, the short form is used, and the stress changes to the last syllable of the
adjective. Derived adjectives do not change their stress.
Examples
      1. Tad ul chobzha; totó.               ‗The grandfather made the canoe (what in my opinion is) small.‘
      2. Antin mol pakcha; tatár.            ‗I bought a flimsy (piece of) cloth.‘
      3. Tad ul chobzha; ul yer tummad. ‗The elder made a very big canoe.‘
      4. Machi koe makcha; kallagwa.         ‗The boy killed a (in my opinion) thin deer.‘
When a speaker highlights an object and evaluates it in terms of the class of similar objects to which it belongs,
the suffix -gwa/-kwa is added to the adjective. Some adjectives may not take the suffix, e.g., tummad ‗big‘.
Examples
    1. Tad ul chobzha; totogwa.                               ‗The elder made (what in my opinion is) a (one of the)
                                                              small (ones) canoe.‘
        2.    Machi koe makcha; kallagwa.                     ‗The boy shot (what in my opinion is) (one of the)
                                                              small deer.‘Exercise 8. Postpredicate position (object evaluation) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,

"19.4.12.1 Contrast
Contrast of one person/object with another or of the actions of two people is handled by adding the
topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin to each of the items to be contrasted. Often the conjunction tenal ‗but‘ is used
to join the two sentences of comparison.
Example
           Pedin ne. (Tenal) antin peine.                    ‗You (on one hand) are going. (But) I (on the other
                                                             hand) am staying.‘19.4.12.2 Difference
When two people/objects are different but only one is mentioned overtly, the adverb akal ‗different‘ is used. It
may be used in stative and non-stative sentences; it may be repeated to indicate ―all different kinds‖ as in
akal-akal ‗all different kinds‘.
Examples
    1. Itidin wis akal.                                      ‗This one is slightly different.‘
    2. We yannudin akal.                                     ‗That peccary is different.‘
    3. Immalmal akal-akal chapurbal nika.                    ‗There are all different kinds of animals in the
                                                             jungle.‘
      4.   Ome mol akal-akal nika.                           ‗The woman has all different kinds of cloth.‘19.4.12.3 Similarity
The adverb yopí ‗the same‘ is used to describe a person/object which remains unchanged. It may be used alone
without naming the person/object when the reference is obvious from the context.
Examples
      1. Wedin yopí takle.                    ‗That looks (exactly) the same.‘
      2. Ampa yopí.                           ‗(It is) still the same.‘
The suffix forms -yob(i) ‗like‘ or -yopí ‗exactly like‘ may be added to the noun or pronoun to which a person or
object is being compared.
Examples
    1. Pe machi peyopí takle.                   ‗Your son looks exactly like you.‘
    2. Pedin tuleyob chunma.                    ‗You speak like (a) Kuna.‘19.4.12.4 Same size comparison
A person/thing may be said to be the same size as another by adding the suffix -un ‗as big/little as‘ to the
person/thing to which the subject is compared.
Examples
    1. Pedrodin e pabun.                        ‗Peter is as big as his father.‘
    2. Maríadin e nanun kudani.                 ‗Mary is getting as big as (her) mother.‘
19.5 Vocabulary                                                                                                267
19.4.12.5 Degrees of comparison
In English, degrees of comparison are made by comparing one person/thing to another by means of an
adjective. Two persons/things may be compared by using the suffix -er or the word ―more‖ attached to the
adjective (e.g., ―bigger‖). A comparison may be made between three or more people/objects by adding the
suffix -est or the word ―most‖ to the adjective (e.g., ―biggest‖).
In Kuna, degrees of comparison are made by using the word pul ‗more/most‘ which precedes the attribute
(adjective) being compared. The person/object compared occurs first in the sentence, with or without the
topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin. The person/object with whom/which it is compared is accompanied by the
indirect object suffix -ga/-ka which, in this instance, parallels English ―than.‖ Or, as in Example 3 below, the
person/object with whom/which it is compared may be omitted.
Examples
     1. Antin chowid.                     ‗I am tall.‘
     2. Antin pega pul chowid.            ‗I am taller than you.‘
     3. Antin pul chowid.                 ‗I am the tallest.‘
     4. Antin egmalga pul chowid.         ‗I am taller than the rest.‘
The word pul ‗more/most‘ may be used also to modify the objects in a sentence expressing possession.
Example       An pega pul mani nika.          ‗I have more money than you.‘
Exercise 15. Comparison drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student compares the subject of the sentence to Peter, substituting the
correct form of the sentence in the frame.
Example      Teacher: Pablo chowid.
             Student: Pablo Pedroga pul chowid.
    Frame ____ Pedroga pul ____.
     1. Pablo chowid.       ‗Paul is tall.‘
     2. Machi kalla.        ‗The boy is thin.‘
     3. Tad chered.         ‗The elder is old.‘
     4. Tule mani nika.     ‗The people have money.‘
     5. Mimmi toto.         ‗The baby is small.‘19.5 Vocabulary

The purpose of this section is to help the student enhance his storytelling style. What can be accomplished in
class in this area is limited, however, features of style can be pointed out and discussed. Practice outside the
classroom is essential.
Note the intonation features of the introduction to the story. Note how to build suspense by pausing at intervals.
Practice the drama of the climax and the wind-down of the story.
Exercise 1. Tracking drill
Track the teacher as he tells the folktale, keeping within two or three syllables at all times.
Exercise 2. Tracking drill
Track the teacher as he tells other short folktales. Try to pick out features which you will be able to practice
incorporating into your own storytelling.
Exercise 3. Oral reading of folktales
Students should take turns reading the folktale consecutively in order to practice correct intonation and gestures.
Exercise 4. Problem drill
The teacher should discuss and demonstrate any portions of the folktale which the students found particularly
difficult to master.","[279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284]"
"1) Primary color names
      The primary colors, in the order in which they are listed below, comprise the base and mid-points of the
      Kuna color spectrum. They are all pure colors and, therefore, highly valued, but red is the most appealing
      of all:
      1. kinnid                   ‗red‘
      2. kollogwad38              ‗yellow‘
      3. arrad                    ‗blue‘2) Coined terms for color
      Secondary colors between the base and mid-points on the spectrum, that is, those such as orange, green,
      and violet, do not have specific names, and are often referred to by coined terms that may vary from one
      speaker to another. The coined tem is derived from the name of a familiar object of similar color plus a
      color suffix -gid.
Examples
    1. kwili apchalgid            ‗the color of parakeet feathers (lime green)‘
    2. chapkalegid                ‗the color of a leaf (green)‘
37
   A more-detailed discussion of Kuna color perspective is found in ―Spectral colors and intensity in Paya Kuna color
terminology‖, Wilma Forster, forthcoming.
38
   Although kollogwad ‗yellow‘ is a coined term derived from kollo ‗ripe‘ plus -gwad, it usually occurs in this form, but
sometimes in a given context a yellow object may be referred to simply as kollo ‗yellow‘. All Kunas use this term for
―yellow‖ and treat it as a pure color. In phrases such as kollo chibugwad ‗whitened yellow‘ note that -gwad is attached to
the modifier rather than to kollo.
9.4 Grammar                                                                                                         1099.4.3.2 Shades of intensity
The pure colors white and black serve as the reference points for indicating intensity of all the spectral colors.
Lighter or darker colors can be referred to by the addition of all degrees of shades ranging from white through
various shades of gray to black. Unlike English/Spanish, the degrees of shade intensity are assigned specific
names.
Examples
    1. chibugwad                     ‗whitish‘
    2. allulugwad                    ‗grayish white‘
    3. purrugwad                     ‗grayish‘
    4. kuturrugwad                   ‗grayish black‘
    5. chichigwad                    ‗blackish‘9.4.3.3 Interpretation of color
As shown in the preceding paragraphs, Kunas refer to the color of an item which is interpreted as black, white,
primary or secondary, by a specific name or by a coined tem. The colors of other items, such as maroon, steel
blue, or pastels which are not intrinsic to a color spectral chart, are interpreted in terms of shade of intensity.
Such colors may be named only for the specific shade of intensity and the presence of a spectral color may be
ignored in the naming. On the other hand, the color may be referred to by modifying the shade of intensity with
the word for the appropriate spectral color.
For example, a pastel pink may be referred to as chibugwad ‗whitish‘, kinnid chibugwad ‗whitish red‘, or
islub chibugwad ‗the whitened color of wild plum‘. Another example is navy blue. Navy may be referred to as
kuturreged ‗grayish black‘, arrad kuturreged ‗blackish blue‘, or purrin kuturreged ‗the grayish-black color
of a blue bird‘.","[121, 122]"

The postpredicate position is used for highlighting or emphasis, for redistribution of information in order to
avoid information overload, or for clarifying.",[243]

   The distinction between sentences 1 and 2 below is very slight:
         1. Machi ua ukcha; nanga.               ‗The boy gave the fish to Mother.‘
         2. Machi nanga ua ukcha; nanga.         ‗The boy gave Mother the fish.‘
Sentence 2 places a somewhat stronger emphasis on the indirect object than does Sentence 1.

The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it repeating the subject in the postpredicate position. The
teacher then repeats the correct answer after the student. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example        Teacher: Wag nade.
               Student: Wag nade; waga.
               Teacher: Wag nade; waga.
       1. Wag nade.                            ‗The outsider left.‘
       2. Pab anka es ukcha.                   ‗Father gave me the machete.‘
       3. Machi ob chunad.                     ‗The boy went to fetch corn.‘
       4. Nandin chi.                          ‗Mother (on the other hand) is at home.‘
       5. Yannu nas.                           ‗The peccaries passed by.‘
Similarly, either the long or short form of the direct object may be used in the postpredicate position, but the use
of the long form in the main part of the sentence occurs only when an adult is speaking to a very small child.
Examples
    1. An ob chune; ob.                       ‗I am going to fetch corn.‘
    2. An ob chune; oba.                      ‗I am going to fetch corn.‘
    3. An oba chune; oba.                     ‗I am going to fetch corn (baby talk).‘
Exercise 11. Postpredicate position (object repetition) frame drill

Exercise 12. Postpredicate position (object repetition) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, repeating the object in the postpredicate position.
Example       Teacher: An ob chune.
              Student: An ob chune; ob.
      1. An ob chune.                         ‗I am going to fetch corn.‘

         expanded form in the postpredicate position1) Element modified by one adjective or a more specific term
      A peripheral element may occur in unmodified form, but with any required suffix, in the simple sentence
      and be repeated in the postpredicate position followed by an adjective to which the suffix is attached, or it
      may be repeated and followed by a more specific term, as in Sentence 4 of Exercise 13.
Exercise 13. Postpredicate position (peripheral element expanded) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: Pab machiga es ukcha; machi tummadga.
              Student: Pab machiga es ukcha; machi tummadga.
      1.   Pab machiga es ukcha; machi tummadga.     ‗Father gave the boy a machete; to the big boy.‘
      2.   Machi ulgin nad; ul arradgin.             ‗The boy went by canoe; in the blue canoe.‘

      4.   Sagla sae arpi; sae wakur.                ‗The chief went yesterday; yesterday morning.‘Exercise 14. Postpredicate position (peripheral element expanded) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, expanding the peripheral element in the postpredicate
position by using one of the suggested expansions below.
Example         Teacher: Nan punga mol ukcha.
                Student: Nan punga mol ukcha; pun tummadga.
          Expansion
       1. tummad               ‗big‘
       2. arrad                ‗blue‘
       3. aluminyogad          ‗aluminum‘
          Statement
       1. Nan punga mol ukcha.               ‗Mother gave the girl cloth.‘
       2. Tad kukualedgin noni.              ‗The elder arrived by plane.‘
       3. Ua pormogin pukwa.                 ‗The fish are in the pot.‘
       4. Machi negzhe immal pelene.         ‗The boy is going to carry the thing to the house.‘
       5. Ome neg akar tani.                 ‗The woman is coming from the house.‘
      The subject likewise, may be highlighted by stating it in an unexpanded form in the simple sentence and in
      an expanded form in the postpredicate position. The expanded form of the subject after the predicate
      includes: subject accompanied by an adjective (long or short form) which is modified by an adverb;
      subject accompanied by a duplicated adjective (long or short form); or subject accompanied by a second
      adjective.
Example
       Ul noni; ul tummad.                  ‗A big canoe arrived. (lit.: the canoe arrived; the big canoe).‘
    When the adjective in the postpredicate position is a numeral, the subject may be omitted if the number
    prefix unambiguously refers to it (see Sections 5.4 and 7.4). The long or short form of the numeral prefix
    may be used.
Examples
    1. Tule noni; tule walapá.                ‗Three people arrived.‘
    2. Tule noni; walapá.                     ‗Three people arrived.‘

      3. Wag nad; waga chowidi.                            ‗The tall outsider left.‘
      4. Wagi ob mas; wagi ichejuli.                       ‗Many parrots ate the corn.‘
      5. Chapi kullubal kwichi; chapi tummadi.             ‗A big tree grows on the (river) bank.‘
Exercise 16. Postpredicate position (subject expansion) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, expanding the subject by using one of the suggested
expansions below.
Example        Teacher: Ul noni.
               Student: Ul noni; ul tummad.
         Expansion
      1. tummad                 ‗big‘
      2. arrad                  ‗blue‘
      3. nued                   ‗good‘
         Statement
      1. Ul noni.                             ‗The canoe arrived.‘
      2. Tud neg tikalbal nis.                ‗The flower grew beside the house.‘
      3. Kukualed aktes.                      ‗The plane landed.‘
      4. Motor nakwis.                        ‗The outboard canoe went/came upriver.‘
      5. Chikwi purkwis.                      ‗The bird died.‘
     Similarly, the direct object may be stated in an unexpanded form in the simple sentence and in an
     expanded form in the postpredicate position in order to highlight or clarify it. The adjective which
     modifies the direct object and occurs in the postpredicate position may occur in its long or short form. If
     two forms exist for that particular adjective, the long form is more descriptive.
Example
        Machi ul pakcha; ul tummadi.      ‗The boy bought a big canoe.‘
    The speaker of this example wishes you to realize that the canoe purchased was a big canoe. The emphasis
    is on the description of the canoe.
     The short form of an adjective which has a long/short form is used to classify the noun it modifies. It gives
     a similar connotation as the English phrase, ―one of the items classified as the ____ (big, fat, little, etc.)
     ones.‖
Example
       Machi ul pakcha; ul tummad.        ‗The boy bought a canoe, one of the big ones.‘
    The speaker of this example wishes you to realize that the canoe purchased was one of the big ones. The
    emphasis is on the group to which/from which the object belongs/was chosen.
     The difference in meaning between sentences using the long and short form of a certain adjective is very
     slight; however, it is helpful to be aware of this shade of meaning.
Exercise 17. Postpredicate position (object expansion) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

Exercise 18. Postpredicate position (object expansion) substitution drill
The teacher gives the sentence and the student repeats it, expanding the object by using one of the suggested
expansions.The teacher then repeats the correct answer using the chosen expansion.
Example       Teacher: Tad ul pakcha.
              Student: Tad ul pakcha; ul tummadi.
              Teacher: Tad ul pakcha; ul tummadi.
      1. Tad ul pakcha.                    ‗The elder bought a canoe.‘

                                               3. iskujaled       ‗broken‘2) Element modified by two adjectives
      In English, any noun may be modified by two adjectives. In Kuna, if an element is to be modified by two
      adjectives, both modifiers do not occur in the simple sentence (see 17.4.1.2). The speaker must determine
      which adjective is more important to him. The element and the less important adjective to which the
      appropriate suffix is attached are placed in the simple sentence. Then the element and the more important
      adjective to which the appropriate suffix is attached are placed in the postverbal position, further
      modifying the element without information overload.
Examples
      1. Sagla ul tummadgin nade; ul kinnidgin.      ‗The chief went in a big red canoe.‘
The speaker chose to emphasize kinnid ‗red‘ rather than tummad ‗big‘.
      2. Tad ul tummad pakcha; ul kinnid.            ‗The elder bought a big red canoe.‘
      3. Tad ul tummad pakcha; ul kinnidi.           ‗The elder bought a big canoe; a red (one).‘
17.4 Grammar                                                                                                      239Exercise 19. Postpredicate position (second adjective with element) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, using a second adjective (from the suggested ones in
the list below) in the postpredicate position.
Example        Teacher: Ul tummad noni.
               Student: Ul tummad noni; ul kinnidi.
         Expansion
      1. kinnid                 ‗red‘
      2. chellele               ‗hard‘
      3. nued                   ‗good‘
         Statement
      1. Ul tummad noni.                                ‗A big canoe arrived.‘
      2. Machi ob ichejul chus.                         ‗The boy fetched lots of corn.‘
      3. Sagla kabaston chowid chobzha.                 ‗The chief made a long baton.‘
      4. Ome mol toto makcha.                           ‗The woman made a small blouse.‘
      5. Nap chunnad pistagin nai.                      ‗There is real soil on the airstrip.‘
     In some cases, one or two adjectives are needed to specifically classify a generic term, thus in a sense,
     becoming part of the actual name of the element. In this case, the long form of the adjective is descriptive
     and the short form is a classification of the object.
Example
    1. achu                            ‗carnivorous animal‘
    2. achu parpad                     ‗spotted carnivorous animal (ocelot)‘
    3. achu parpad tummad              ‗large spotted carnivorous animal (either a jaguar or a big ocelot)‘
Example
    1. Machi achu parpad mecha; achu tummad.         ‗The boy killed a jaguar (class of animal).‘
    2. Machi achu parpad mecha; achu tummadi.        ‗The boy killed a big ocelot.‘
Exercise 20. Postpredicate position (second adjective with direct object) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: Tad ul tummad pakcha; ul kinnidi.
              Student: Tad ul tummad pakcha; ul kinnidi.
      1. Tad ul tummad pakcha; ul kinnidi.            ‗The elder bought a big red canoe.‘
      2. Ome mol kinnid pakcha; mol nuedi.            ‗The woman bought good red cloth.‘
      3. Ome mas ichejul tus; mas nugu kullegedi.     ‗The woman cooked lots of delicious food.‘
      4. Machi wag chowid takcha; wag istara.         ‗The boy saw a tall, wicked outsider.‘
      5. Machi achu parpad mecha; achu tummadi.       ‗The boy killed a large (spotted) jaguar.‘3) Element modified by a modified adjective
     Occasionally, the adjective which describes an element is itself modified by an adverb such as yer ‗very‘
     or pezhe ‗too‘. Or sometimes the attribute of the adjective is enhanced (intensified) by repetition. An
     element thus modified appears in the simple sentence with the unmodified adjective and the appropriate
     suffix (if any) and then in the postpredicate position it is repeated and followed by the adjective modifier
     (adverb or repeated adjective), the adjective and the appropriate suffix. Modified adjectives tend to occur
     only in the postpredicate position.
Examples
    1. Sagla ul totogin nade; ul yer totogin.             ‗The chief left in a very small canoe.‘
240                                                                                                 Telling Stories      2.   Sagla ul tummadgin nade; ul                    ‗The chief left in a really big canoe.‘
           tummad-tummadgin.
      3.   Ul tummad noni; ul yer tunkus.                 ‗A very big canoe arrived. (lit. the big canoe arrived,
                                                          the very grown one).‘
      4.   Ul tummad noni; ul tummad-tummad.              ‗The very big canoe arrived. (lit.: the big canoe
                                                          arrived, the big, big canoe).‘Exercise 21. Postpredicate position (repeated adjective with direct object) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example        Teacher: Tad ul tummad chobzha; ul tummad-tummad.
               Student: Tad ul tummad chobzha; ul tummad-tummad.
      1. Tad ul tummad chobzha; ul                        ‗The elder made a really big canoe.‘
           tummad-tummad.
      2. Ome mol kinnid pakcha; mol kinnid-kinnid. ‗The woman bought a pure red piece of cloth.‘
      3. Machi karpa toto chobzha; karpa toto-toto. ‗The boy made a really small basket.‘
      4. Wag wawadun kollo pakpi; wawadun                 ‗The outsider wanted to buy really ripe bananas.‘
           kollo-kollo.
      5. Wag kullubal ul nungus ebes; ul                  ‗The outsider left a very rotten canoe on the (river)
           nungus-nungus.                                 bank.‘
      An adjective is normally only modified by an adverb when it has been mentioned by a previous speaker
      and the present speaker wishes to intensify and/or clarify the attribute of the adjective. For example, a
      speaker may say, ―Did he make a big canoe?‖ The reply may intensify the adjective by saying, ―He made
      a very big canoe.‖ or ―He made a big canoe, a very big one.‖
      Long and short forms of the modified adjectives and the evaluation classification suffix -gwa/-kwa may
      be used where applicable (see 18.4.5.2 and also for cases in which just the modified adjective may occur
      in the postpredicate position).
Examples
Adjective modified by an adverb

           in the postpredicate position
Occasionally, when the term for an element is momentarily forgotten, a non-specific (generic) term with the
appropriate suffix occurs in the simple sentence and the specific term and suffix occur after the predicate. Such
generic terms as immal ‗thing/animal‘ tule ‗people‘ and iwen ‗what‘s-his-name/what-you-call-it‘ are often thus
used. In such a case, however, the preferred construction is to omit a peripheral element from the simple
sentence and include it only in the postpredicate position.
Exercise 23. Postpredicate position (peripheral element specific term) frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example         Teacher: An iwenga mol pakcha; Pedroga.
                Student: An iwenga mol pakcha; Pedroga.
       1. An iwenga mol pakcha; Pedroga.                ‗I bought cloth for what‘s-his-name, Peter.‘
       2. An tuleje ekisne; saglaje.                    ‗I am going to ask a Kuna, the chief.‘
       3. An iwengin es onos; ulgin.                    ‗I found the machete, m-mmm, in the canoe.‘
       4. Wag iwen akar tani; Pukur akar.               ‗The outsider came from m-mmm, from Pucuru.‘
       5. Ua iwengin pukwa; mesagin.                    ‗The fish is on the ... on the table.‘
In the case of the subject, the generic-specific construction is sometimes deliberately used to withhold
information and thus highlight it after the predicate. Either the long or short form (if available) may be used for
the subject when it occurs after the predicate.
Examples
    1. Immal noni; nu.                                    ‗A dove arrived (lit.: something arrived, a dove).‘
    2. Iwen noni; Pablo.                                  ‗Paul arrived (lit.: someone arrived, Paul).‘
    3. Tulemal arpi; Pay tolgan.                          ‗The people from Paya went and came back (lit.:

it in the postpredicate position of the sentence.

              Student: Tule ormapukwa; macherganbi.
         Subject
      1. macherganbi                    ‗only the men‘
      2. omegan                         ‗the women/girls‘
      3. punamal                        ‗the young women/girls‘
      4. nuskan                         ‗the children‘
         Statement
      1. Tule ormapukwa.                ‗The people are discussing (in a meeting).‘
      2. Tule neg turwinai.             ‗The people are sweeping the town.‘
      3. Tule mol enuknai.              ‗The people are washing clothing.‘
      4. Tule turtanai.                 ‗The people are learning.‘
Exercise 26. Postpredicate position (subject generic) drill
The teacher gives the sentence and the student substitutes a generic subject in the main part of the sentence and
moves the specific subject to the postpredicate position.
Example        Teacher: Chule noni.
               Student: Immal noni; chule.
          Subject
       1. immal                 ‗things/animal‘
       2. tule                  ‗person/people‘
       3. iwen                  ‗what‘s-its-name‘
          Statement
       1. Chule noni.                         ‗The paca arrived.‘
       2. Nuskan todonani.                    ‗The children are playing.‘
       3. Machergan arpanani.                 ‗The men are working.‘
       4. María mol enuknai.                  ‗Mary is washing clothes.‘
       5. Chigli namanai.                     ‗The wild turkey is calling (singing).‘
       6. Yannu nas.                          ‗The peccary passed by.‘
Similarly, a direct object may be highlighted by stating it in a generic term in the simple sentence and stating a
specific term in the postpredicate position. Such a generic term as immal ‗animal‘ may be used. The long or
short form of the specific noun may be used where applicable. The short form of the specific term refers to a
class of objects whereas the long form refers to an animal within the class.
In many cases, however, the specific form of the object is not withheld because of a desire to emphasize the
object, but rather the generic form accompanied by a verb may convey a single concept. One such phrase is
immal pak meaning ‗to shop‘ rather than ‗to buy something‘; similarly immal amine means ‗to hunt‘ rather
than ‗to look for something‘. In sentences using the generic term and accompanying verb to convey a single
concept, the purpose of the postpredicate position is clarification.

18.1 Dialogue
It is common for a visitor from outside the village to ask a string of questions on arrival. Most of these are the
standard questions asked on arrival at someone‘s house.
After greeting the house owner, the visitor begins a conversation by asking routine. questions.
     1.    Visitor:        ¿Pede?                             ‗(What have) you been doing?‘

    The suffix -d always attaches on to the long form of the previous suffix, e.g., aturchas/aturchaja becomes aturchajad
and nos/noja becomes nojad.

    The positional verb ti ‗to have been (somewhere)‘ is used in the past; tio ‗to be (going to be somewhere)‘ in the future;
and ta ‗to (go about doing habitually)‘ in an habitual sense.

                Student: Chuli. An pato chapurbal ti.
      Frame Chuli. An pato ____ ti.         ‗No. I have already been to the ____.‘
       1. ¿Pe chapurbal ne?                 ‗Are you going to go to the jungle?‘
       2. ¿Pe negzhe ne?                    ‗Are you going to go home?‘

       5. ¿Pe immal amine?                  ‗Are you going to go hunting?‘18.4.3 Gerundial verb form (Ex. 7)
The gerund in English is formed by adding the ending -ing to the verb stem, whereas in Kuna it is composed of
the long form of the verb stem, that is to say, the verb stem which has the -e. There is no tense aspect suffix in
the Kuna gerund.
The gerund is able to act like a noun, for example, ―The doing of it is difficult.‖ In Kuna, as in English, the
gerund focuses on the type of action, versus the doing of the action. Take for example the two phrases, ―to plant
rice‖ and ―rice planting‖. The first phrase tends to focus on the doing of the action, whereas the second phrase
tends to focus on the act itself.
Examples
      1. An cho chike.           ‗I have been firewood cutting.‘
         but
      2. An cho chikti.          ‗I have been to cut firewood.‘
Following are illustrations of the lack of time aspect suffix:
Examples
   1a. ¿Pia pe ne?              ‗Where are you going?‘
    b. Mas chike.               ‗Plantain cutting.‘
   2a. ¿Ibi chenai?             ‗What are you doing?‘
    b. Mas chike.               ‗Plantain cutting.‘
   3a. ¿Pia pe ti?              ‗Where have you been?‘
    b. Mas chike.               ‗Plantain cutting.‘
Exercise 7. Gerund stimulus-response drill
The teacher asks one of the three questions listed below and then selects one of the verbs listed below and says
it. The student replies to the teacher‘s question using the gerund, i.e., -e form of the verb in the frame. This
exercise should be repeated several times, changing the frame to some other suitable one.
Example         Teacher: ¿Pia pe ne?
                Teacher: chik
                Student: Mas chike.
      Frame Mas ____-e.                       ‗Plantain ____-ing.‘
          Questions
       1. ¿Pia pe ne?             ‗Where are you going?‘
       2. ¿Pia pe ti?             ‗Where have you been?‘
       3. ¿Ibi chenai?            ‗What are you doing?‘
          Verbs
       1. chik          ‗to cut‘
       2. pak           ‗to buy‘
       3. uk            ‗to sell/give‘
       4. met           ‗to throw out‘

      8. kun           ‗to eat‘
      9. enuk          ‗to wash‘
     10. chu           ‗to fetch/take‘18.4.4 Qualitative suffix -gwa/-kwa
The qualitative suffix -gwa/-kwa is used to identify/describe an object by its nature/quality and parallels the
English construction ‗a ____ one‘. This suffix may be added to some nouns and many adjectives; one must
learn which forms are acceptable and which are not, since there are no general rules.
Examples
       1. We omegwa e mimmi akwe.                   ‗A female (one) cares for the young.‘
       2. Machi orokwagwa.                          ‗The boy is (a) short (one).‘
The suffix -d(i) may be added to the -gwa/-kwa form of a word and has the effect of the definite English article
―the‖.
Examples
    1. Antin omegwad(i) pakcha.                         ‗I bought the female (of a pair).‘
    2. Pe anka es orokwagwad(i) uko.                    ‗Please give me the short machete.‘18.4.5 Postpredicate position of basic elements (Ex. 8–20)
In Lesson XVII, general guidelines for using the postpredicate position were discussed. In this lesson,
guidelines specific to the basic elements of the sentence -- subject, direct object, and predicate -- are discussed.","[260, 261, 262]"
"17.2.2.5 Interjections
Interjections by the narrator indicate his personal sentiments or emotional attitude toward the situation and help
to set the stage for the story.

Kuna culture prescribes a listener‘s code of etiquette. As a language learner, you will undoubtedly have many
opportunities to hear fascinating tales from your Kuna friends. A person listening to a story is expected to
interject appropriate responses, conversation sustainers (see XI.D.3.), in order to assure the storyteller of your
continuing interest.
In meetings, if the speaker has exceeded the time due him according to his status, he is ―talked down‖. The
older men start talking to each other getting louder and louder until the speaker is drowned out. Occasionally
this happens if nobody agrees with the speaker. Even then, normally he has a fair hearing and only gets ―talked
down‖ when he starts to reiterate what he has already said.","[242, 243]"
"3.2.3.2 Intonation pattern of questions
A question has a different intonation pattern from a statement. The actual order of words in a question which requires
a yes/no answer is the same order as for a statement. Because the word order does not vary, it is important that you
learn the intonation patterns for questions versus statements in order to distinguish a question from an answer.
In Kuna, the pitch at which the question is said is higher than the pitch of a statement. The last word of a
question is even higher pitch than the rest of the question and then the pitch of that word falls off quickly.
Exercise 5. Yes/no question intonation drill
Mimic the intonation of the teacher by humming the the intonation of the following questions.
      1. ¿Pe mas chikne?                       ‗Are you going to cut plantains?‘
      2. ¿Pe mol pakne?                        ‗Are you going to buy cloth?‘
      3. ¿Pe ogob tigne?                       ‗Are you going to plant the coconut?‘
      4. ¿Pe ua tune?                          ‗Are you going to cook the fish?‘
      5. ¿Machi ob kunne?                      ‗Is the boy going to eat the corn?‘

      5. ¿Machi ul chune?                ‗Is the boy going to fetch the canoe?‘
Note: The lenis consonant b becomes m when it occurs before n
Example       kob + -ne = komne               ‗going to drink‘
Exercise 7. Statement intonation pattern drill
The teacher drills the students using Sentences 1–5 below as statements.
Example      Teacher: Machi ob kunne.

      1. Machi ob kunne.                      ‗The boy is going to eat corn.‘
      2. Machi mas chikne.                    ‗The boy is going to cut plantains.‘
      3. Machi immal amine.                   ‗The boy is going to hunt (something).‘
      4. Machi ina komne.                     ‗The boy is going to drink the medicine.‘
      5. Machi ul chune.                      ‗The boy is going to fetch the canoe.‘
Exercise 8. Question and statement contrast
The teacher says one of the sentences above. The student has to identify whether the teacher has uttered a
question or a statement and writes ―question‖ or ―statement‖ on his answer sheet.
Examples         Teacher (says):        ¿Machi immal amine?
                 Student (writes):      question
                 Teacher (says):        Machi mas chikne.
                 Student (writes):      statement
If difficulty is experienced by the student in hearing the differences in the exercise, then the student should
practice Exercise 9.
Exercise 9. Question and statement contrast
The student should listen while the teacher repeats Sentences 1–5 in Exercise 6 above. The teacher then inserts
the following sentence between Sentences 4 and 5 as a statement (A) or as a question (B). The student has to tell
the teacher which has been used -- a question or a statement. The exercise should be repeated several times.
     A. Machi ua makne.                       ‗The boy is going to spear fish.‘
     B. ¿Machi ua makne?                      ‗Is the boy going to spear fish?‘
Exercise 10. Question and statement contrast
Repeat Exercise 9 using the statements in Exercise 7. Again, the student needs to distinguish whether the
statement (A) or the question (B) has been inserted.
Note: After Exercises 9 and 10 are successfully completed, Exercise 8 should be repeated.","[38, 39]"

6.4.1 Positional verbs (Ex. 4–5)
In English/Spanish it is relatively easy to talk about the general location or presence of a person or object by
using the verb ‗to be‘ or estar.
Examples
         English                              Spanish
      1. The spear is on the floor.           El chuzo está en el piso.
      2. The spear is against the wall.       El chuzo está recostado a la pared.
      3. The basket is on the floor.          La canasta está en el piso.
You will note in the above examples that the same verb, (is), is used throughout the English examples to refer to
general location of the object. The verb está is used throughout the Spanish examples.
A Kuna speaker, however, must choose one from several positional verbs to refer to the general location and
position of a person or object. The above English/Spanish examples require three different positional verbs to
be said in Kuna.
Examples
    1. Eswal             napkin            mai.
       spear             on-the-ground     is-(lying)
       ‗The spear is lying on the ground.‘
60                                                                                                  Positional Words         2. Eswal             ilagin            kwichi.
            spear             on-the-wall       is-(leaning/standing)
            ‗The spear is leaning against the wall.‘
         3. Karpa              napkin            chi.
            basket             on-the-ground     is-(sitting)
            ‗The basket is sitting on the ground.‘
The general location of a person/object is always viewed in light of his/its position. There are five basic
potential positions—lying, sitting, hanging (suspended), standing, and ―on all fours‖—each of which is
indicated by one of five20 positional verbs. When a Kuna speaks of the location of a person/object, he must
choose the positional verb which, in his point of view, reflects the position of the person/object.
Examples
    1. Aktigal mai.                   ‗The canoe pole is (lying) there.‘
    2. Nalas chi.                     ‗The orange is (sitting) there.‘
    3. Mol nai.                       ‗The blouse is (hanging) there.‘
    4. Eswal kwichi.                  ‗The spear is (standing up) there.‘
    5. Koe un.                        ‗The deer is (on all fours) there.‘6.4.1.1 Positional verbs with reference to objects
Various situations or objects indicate to a Kuna speaker the specific positional verb which ought to be used.","[71, 72, 73]"

                        → visualize → words, but not:

In order to really learn something in Kuna, you have to go through five steps in the learning process.","[321, 322]"
"1) Avoiding ambiguity
        Sometimes a speaker, in the process of saying a sentence, will realize that his meaning has been obscure,
        and he will add a word following the predicate to avoid ambiguity or to clarify the intended meaning.
Example              An ul pei; ul kinnigwad.    ‗I want the canoe; the red canoe.‘2) Afterthought
        Occasionally, a speaker will add information in this position as an afterthought. Such a thought is
        sometimes added to forestall an expected objection by the listener, by clarifying the intended meaning.
Example
              Kujal, an pe pennuko ... chedo, itos.         ‗Later I will pay you back; ... (pause) ... this
                                                            afternoon, you understand.‘
104
      See 9.4.4.3.
232                                                                                                            Telling Stories3) Hesitancy
      At other times, the postpredicate position is used to fill in information after the speaker pauses because he
      has momentarily forgotten or omitted an item. In such instances, a generic (non-specific) term may occur
      in the main sentence and a specific term after the predicate.
Example
    1. ¿Toa nad?                                   ‗Who went?‘
    2. ... Iwen nad; ... m-mmm Pedro.              ‗(Thinking) So-n-so went; ... m-mmm Peter.‘
Exercise 4. Postpredicate position intonation drill
Stage 1 - Mimicking
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student hums the tune; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student hums
the tune, etc.
Stage 2 - Tracking
The student tracks the teacher as he says Sentence 1; the student tracks the teacher as he says Sentence 2, etc.
Stage 3 - Frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc.
Example        Teacher: Tule noni; tule walapá.
               Student: Tule noni; tule walapá.
       1. Tule noni; tule walapá.           ‗Three people arrived.‘
       2. Machi ne; immal amine.            ‗The boy is going to hunt.‘
       3. Ul noni; ul tummadi.              ‗The big canoe arrived.‘
       4. Anka chogbalo; pinna.             ‗Tell me again slowly.‘
       5. Machi mol ukcha; nanga.           ‗The boy gave the cloth to (his) mother.‘17.4.2 Guidelines for placing elements in the postpredicate position (Ex. 5–28)
For purposes of discussion, the elements of the simple sentence are divided into two classes: basic and
peripheral. Basic elements are the subject, the direct object (in transitive sentences), and the predicate. All other
elements of the simple sentence are peripheral: indirect object; locative, goal and time words and phrases; and
adjectives and adverbs.105
The guidelines for placing both peripheral and basic elements in the postpredicate position are similar. Those
for placing peripheral elements there tend to be more general, however, and are, therefore, dealt with before the
more specific ones for basic elements. If the same guideline applies to a basic element, it is included in this
section. Guidelines specific to basic elements are discussed in Lesson XVIII.D.5. When a peripheral element is
to be placed in the postpredicate position for purposes of highlighting or clarifying, it may be handled in one of
four ways.","[244, 245]"

This forces you to do several things:
1. Use what you know of the language.
2. Expand the areas of language that you need most.
3. Decrease the use of the national language, which helps you to start ―thinking‖ in Kuna.
4. Usage helps the words and patterns you employ to become more automatic.b. Problem
Speaking only Kuna will increase cultural stress.137 It is important to note that cultural stress is different from
culture shock inasmuch as it affects everybody who lives in a culture other than their own. The frustration of
trying to communicate in a language you do not control increases your stress load. This is especially true in the
early days but will decrease as your ability to speak Kuna increases. In addition, moving around in a minefield
of unknown cultural booby traps in the form of gestures, attitudes and nuances of spoken clues, is also very
stressful. You should be aware of how to recognize and deal with this problem. There is much written on this
subject which would be of help. In light of this problem. the rule of ―speak Kuna and only Kuna‖ should be
modified.
For instance, depending upon your intended length of stay, stress tolerance, etc., ―only Kuna‖ might have to be
modified to ―only Kuna for X number of hours per day.‖ Preferably you should state when this should be, e.g.,
12:00 noon - 8:00 p.m. (the busy visiting time). It will take discipline even to do this, but the effort will be
worth it. Cultural relaxation, such as light reading or music is good after the end of the designated period for
speaking.c. Setting the limit on speaking only Kuna
There are three ways in which you can limit (modify) the rule of ―speak only Kuna, always.‖ Again, you need
to remember that you are looking for the minimum number of exceptions to this rule that will allow you to
work and live within your limitations (of your stress load, etc.).","[322, 323]"
"1. Goal of language learning
The ultimate goal of language learning is to be completely bilingual; to be able to say anything you want to
express with all the nuances of meaning and shades of emotion with as much facility as you can in your first
language (mother tongue). Although few people really achieve this goal, it is something for which we should all
aim. However, for our encouragement along the way, there are various stages (levels) of achievement. The
following is one scheme:
Stage 1: When you are able to greet people and say goodbye.
Stage 2: When you are also able to exchange pleasantries.
Stage 3: When you are able to parrot fixed phrases, dealing with essential needs such as food, shelter, a guide,
         directions, basic buying and selling.
Stage 4: When you are able to communicate effectively in the specialized areas where you have most contact
         such as medical, trade, teaching or work projects.
Stage 5: When you are able to communicate, generally, in all common aspects of everyday life with a limited
         number of verb aspects (tenses).
Stage 6: When you are able to control reasonably well most normal grammatical relationships such as
         cause-effect, time, location, condition, purpose, ability, possibility and motion verbs.
Stage 7: When you are fluent in any non-abstract area up through Stage 6 and reasonably control focus and
         emphasis.
Stage 8: When you are able to talk about the abstract, present an argument, use figures of speech, etc.
Stage 9: When you are able to discuss emotions, values ,and able to discuss life from the Kuna philosophical
         viewpoint.
Goal: Absolute bilingualism.",[320]
"
105
   It could be argued that locative and goal words and phrases are basic elements of sentences with motion or positional
verbs and that the indirect object is a basic element with a ditransitive verb. However, we have chosen to treat as peripheral
any nominal element in which a suffix indicates its function. By this criterion, only subject and object, and possibly
vocative, are basic nominal elements.

The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

"1) Verb form in strong command
        The short or the long form of a verb stem may be used in a strong command.a) Short form of verb stem in strong command
     The short verb stem may be used as a strong command.
Examples
    1. ¡Ne!                 ‗Go!‘
    2. ¡Tag!                ‗Come!‘
    3. ¡Kun!                ‗Eat!‘b) Long form of the verb stem in a strong command
     The long form of a verb stem may also be used in a strong command. The two forms are used
     interchangeably; however, the long form is preferred in situations where the speaker is:
        1. Angry or exasperated.
        2. Repeating the command because of non-compliance.
        3. Some distance away from the person he/she is addressing.
Examples
    1. ¡Ne!91        ‗Go!‘
    2. ¡Tage!        ‗Come!‘
    3. ¡Kunne!       ‗Eat!‘
    Note the situations in the following examples:

A mother speaks angrily to her child.
      1. ¡Tage!                  ‗Co-o-o-ome!‘
A father speaks to his child.
     2a. ¡Tag!               ‗Come!‘
The child makes no move to comply with the command, so the father speaks again.
     b. ¡Tage!                   ‗Co-o-o-ome!‘
The chief calls to a boy in the distance.
         3. Machi, ¡Tage!        ‗(Hey) Boy, come!‘2) Additional information included in a strong command
        In contrast to the polite command, a strong command is usually comprised of only a verb. It keeps
        additional elements to a minimum. Additional information may be used to intensify the command or to
        clarify a certain aspect of the command.a) Intensification of strong command
      When a speaker wishes to make a certain aspect of command more forceful, that aspect is added to the
      command in the normal word order. That is to say, it precedes the verb. When the subject of the command
      is made more forceful, the vocative92 form is used. It may be either the long or short form.
Examples
    1. ¡Machi, tage!             ‗Boy, come!‘
    2. Negzhe ne.                ‗Go home.‘
    3. Machi, negzhe ne.         ‗Boy, go home.‘b) Clarification in strong command
     Should a certain aspect of the command be ambiguous in a situation, the ambiguity may be clarified by
     stating the aspect in a postpredicate position after the verb (see 17.4.1).
Examples
    1. ¡Ne, negzhe!              ‗Go home!‘
    2. ¡Tage, machi!             ‗Come, boy/son!‘
    3. ¡Cheddago, ina!           ‗Bring it, the medicine!‘
Exercise 7. Strong command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example          Teacher: ¡Tag!
                 Student: ¡Tag!

       8. ¡Kueye!                  ‗(To a dog) Shoo! Scat! (lit.: quickly).‘c) Repeated command suffix -ma93
     When a speaker realizes that a strong command he has given is not heeded, he may repeat the identical
     command adding the repeated command suffix -ma to the verb for emphasis. The repeated command
     suffix -ma parallels the English phrase, ―I told you to ...!‖
Examples
Mother speaks to her child.
     1. ¡Kwisku!              ‗Stand up!‘
The child does not respond and the mother speaks again.
       2. ¡Kwiskuma!               ‗(I told you to) stand up!‘
Exercise 10. Repeated command suffix -ma frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example        Teacher: ¡Kwiskuma!
               Student: ¡Kwiskuma!
       1. ¡Kwiskuma!         ‗Stand up, I said!‘
       2. ¡Mellema!          ‗Don‘t (do it), I said!‘
       3. ¡Kobma!            ‗Drink it, I said!‘
       4. ¡Chuma!            ‗Take it, I said!‘
       5. ¡Chogma!           ‗Tell (me), I said!‘
Exercise 11. Stimulus response drill with repeated command suffix -ma
The teacher selects and gives a command from the list below and the student rephrases the command using the
-ma form.
Example        Teacher: ¡Kwisku!
               Student: ¡Kwiskuma!
       1. ¡Kwisku!     ‗Stand up!‘
       2. ¡Kob!        ‗Drink!‘
       3. ¡Chu!        ‗Fetch (it)!‘
       4. ¡Chog!       ‗Say (it)!‘
       5. ¡Kun!        ‗Eat!‘
       6. ¡Chig!       ‗Sit down!‘d) Respectful form of strong commands
     A respectful attitude can be maintained when using a strong command form by adding the suffix -ra to the
     long form of the strong command (long form of the verb stem).
Example         ¡Togera!                           ‗Do come in!‘
93
  -ma is an intensifier suffix and may be added to the end of other verb forms (following all other suffixes) to intensify the
action. Experience will help you to understand situations in which the suffix -ma is appropriate. It is not a common suffix.

A very polite command in Kuna is an even more polite form than the polite command. The speaker still expects
the action to be carried out, but phrases the command in a most courteous, tactful, polite manner. The very
polite command also tends to be used to coax a friend into doing something.","[209, 210, 211, 212, 213]"

     For example, kagan ‗foliage‘.

     Note that the pluralization of the positional verb un ‗on all fours‘ is formed by the addition of the group marker –mal(a).

              Student: Nuskan kammami.
      1. Nuskan kammami.               ‗The children are sleeping.‘
      2. Yegusmalad kachigin mami.     ‗The sick ones are lying in hammocks.‘
      3. Chigli pukwa.                 ‗Wild turkeys are there.‘
      4. Mol mesagin pukwa.            ‗The clothes are on the table.‘
      5. Eswal magarbal pukwa.         ‗The spears are standing outside.‘
      6. Tulemal arpanani.             ‗The group of people are working.‘
      7. Nuskan todonani.              ‗The children are playing.‘
Exercise 13. nani/mami/pukwa substitution drill
The teacher says the sentence in the singular and the student repeats it, changing it to the plural form.
Example       Teacher: Tule arpanai.
              Student: Tule arpanani.
      1. Tule arpanai.                        ‗The person/Kuna is working.‘
      2. Yannu chowal mali kunnai.            ‗The peccary is eating a root.‘
      3. Karpa chi.                           ‗The basket is (there).‘
      4. Mol neggin chi.                      ‗The cloth is at home.‘
      5. Es mesa ulpal mai.                   ‗The machete is under the table.‘
      6. Mimmi kammai.                        ‗The baby is sleeping.‘
      7. Eswal wegin kwichi.                  ‗The spear is standing there.‘
      8. Chia tuppal kwichi.                  ‗The cocoa tree is on the peninsula.‘2) Use of group marker -mal with verbs
      When -mal is added to the verb, it indicates that the whole group to which the subject refers performed the
      action of the verb at the same time, i.e., all the members are included in the action.
Example
        Tule nanmal.           ‗The people all left (at the same time).‘
    This does not have the same meaning as Tule pel nade. ‗All the people left (at various times).‘ Rather, it
    indicates that the whole group performed the action of the verb at the same time.
Exercise 14. Group marker -mal with verb frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example        Teacher: Tulemal arpananimal.
               Student: Tulemal arpananimal.
      1. Tulemal arpananimal.                 ‗The people are all working.‘
      2. Nuskan todonanimal.                  ‗The children are all playing.‘
      3. Machimal nanmal.                     ‗The boys all went.‘
      4. Machergan ormapukmal.                ‗The men are all in a meeting.‘
      5. Wagi ob masmal.                      ‗The parrots all ate the corn.‘
Note the suffix order, that -mal inclusive occurs after the aspect markers -ne, -cha, -nani, etc., but before -bal
‗again‘ or -mo ‗too‘. It is in Group II.
Example
       Machimal mas kuchamalbal.              ‗The boys all ate food again.‘
Exercise 15. Group marker -mal with verb drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it using the -mal form.

The use of the verb ku ‗to happen/become‘ parallels the English construction, ―(An event) happened.‖ Various
verbal suffixes may be added to ku to give shades of meaning.
Examples
      1. ¿Igi kude?             ‗What has happened?‘
      2. ¿Igi kunani?           ‗What is (things are) happening?‘
      3. ¿Igi kudi?             ‗How did you behave/react/respond?‘
      4. ¿Igi kus?              ‗How did it happen?‘
      5. ¿Igi an kuo?           ‗What will happen to me (externally)?‘
      6. ¿Igi ankin kuo?        ‗What will happen to me (internally)?‘
      7. Teob kus.              ‗That is what happened.‘
The verb ku may be used as a suffix -ku/-gu which attaches to an adjective or to another verb in order to form a
construction paralleling the English construction, ―to become...‖.
Examples
      1. An yegus.             ‗I became sick.‘
      2. Mol tinkus.           ‗The clothes became dry.‘
      3. An es amigual.        ‗I came to be (became) looking for the machete.‘
The discussion of -ku/-gu as a past dependent prior condition is found in Section 12.4.1.2.2-B.
Example
       Neg omosgu, tulemal pukwa.            ‗When I arrived at the place, the people were there.‘13.4.5 Conjunctions
There are only a few commonly used conjunctions in Kuna. In general speech or storytelling, a conjunction or a
subordinate clause (see 12.4.2.1b) is used at the beginning of almost every sentence. Several common
conjunctions are discussed. Many of them are based on te ‗then‘.","[180, 181, 182, 183]"
