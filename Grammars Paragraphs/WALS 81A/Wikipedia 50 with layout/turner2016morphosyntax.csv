   Where the pointer is left by the lexical actions of the verb is another point of language variation.
That it is left on the external argument node reﬂects the fact that Katcha basic word order is either
SVO or VSO.

pointer may move to the node above. It may then move down the tree to a node
with outstanding requirements, in this case the internal argument node, which is also
decorated with a metavariable and requires a formula value. A computational action
that may apply in this context is Late *Adjunction which builds an unﬁxed node
below a ﬁxed one provided they share type annotations. This rule therefore builds an
unﬁxed node requiring type e from the internal argument node (8.10).","[173, 174]"

1.3 Theoretical Analyses
The second part of the thesis provides a theoretical analysis of the nominal system of
Katcha within the framework of Dynamic Syntax (DS). Two key features of the DS
formalism come into play. Firstly, DS construes semantic individuals as terms of the
epsilon calculus. This feature is utilised in the analysis of verb extensions (chapter
8), which are construed as projecting context-dependent epsilon terms, providing a
value for the ‘missing’ argument. Secondly, DS allows information sharing between
propositions by means of a ‘LINK’ relation. This feature is utilised in the analysis of
adjuncts such as prepositional phrases (chapter 9), which are construed as projecting
a subordinate proposition which shares an argument with the matrix tree. These two
formal tools come together in the analysis of nominal modiﬁers (chapter 10), which are
construed as projecting a possibly complex epsilon term LINKed to some term in the
matrix tree, directly reﬂecting their descriptive analysis as appositional nominals.
1.3. Theoretical Analyses                                                               7   Chapter 8 presents a Dynamic Syntax analysis of valency-reducing verb extensions.
The diﬀerence between a transitive verb with object pro-drop on the one hand, and an
antipassive verb on the other, is that the transitive verb projects an object metavariable
allowing a referential argument whereas the antipassive saturates its object node with
a context-dependent epsilon term. Such a term picks out an arbitrary witness of some
predicate deﬁned as being dependent on the immediate context. The epsilon term
is thus a semantic object of minimal content, whose reference is both arbitrary and
entirely context-dependent. Heavily context-dependent objects of this kind allow a
straightforward analysis of reduced valency constructions such as ‘Drums are beaten
(by some arbitrary agent of drum beating)’.
   Chapter 9 outlines a Dynamic Syntax approach to prepositional phrases which
construes them as adjuncts, constructing LINKed structure from whichever node of
the main propositional tree they modify. The analysis is developed by applying it not
only to prepositional phrases, but also to other relevant constructions in the Katcha
data. Prepositional phrases which have an intersective interpretation modify a term,
either an individual or an event. They are construed as building a LINKed propositional
tree that provides extra information about some argument in the matrix proposition.
As such they are similar to relative clauses, and use the same technical apparatus as
standard DS treatments of relatives. The formal details of the process are reﬁned
slightly in order to extend the analysis to handle the recursive locative prepositional
phrases common in Katcha. This reﬁnement makes use only of DS tools that have
been proposed independently for other constructions in other languages. Prepositional
phrases which have a subsective interpretation modify predicates. They are construed
as building a LINKed tree providing extra information about some predicate in the
matrix proposition. The analysis is then extended to locative adverbs, construing
them as modifying a predicate projected by the locative preposition, thus bringing
together the analyses of the two types of modiﬁcation. Lastly, the analysis is applied
to applicatives, arguing that these may be treated much like prepositions, the only real
diﬀerence being that the applicative morpheme does not form a syntactic constituent
with its complement. The chapter ﬁnishes by discussing the notion of case in the light
of the analysis presented for prepositional phrases and it is suggested that this may
shed light on indirect and applied objects, topicalised subjects and the form of personal
pronouns in Katcha.
   Chapter 10 provides a Dynamic Syntax analysis of nominal modiﬁers, following
on from the arguments advanced in chapter 5 that nominal modiﬁers are appositional
demonstrative pronouns, or are phrases headed by them. The implementation begins
with an analysis of Katcha nouns, noting that lexical nouns cannot be modiﬁed inter-
nally and so must project a fully speciﬁed epsilon structure, and a discussion of the
process of LINK Apposition and its evaluation which are used to allow modiﬁcation.

demonstrative pronoun allows it to add speciﬁc reference to a lexical noun phrase. This
is followed by an analysis of subject relative clauses and possessors. Crucial to these is
an extension to the notion of the metavariable projected by the demonstrative pronoun
such that it projects a partial epsilon term with a variable and binder, but no restrictor.
The restrictor is then provided by the relative clause or in the case of a possessive, a
contextually provided possession predicate. This analysis of the Katcha demonstrative
pronoun has the beneﬁcial consequence that it correctly predicts the fact that possessive
phrases in Katcha are head-marking rather than dependent-marking and also the fact
that that non-subjects may not be relativised directly.","[25, 26, 27]"

8.6 Conclusion
This chapter has outlined an analysis of valency-reducing verb extensions in Katcha,
making use of the Dynamic Syntax construal of terms as expressions of the epsilon
calculus. The inherent internal structure of epsilon terms allows a straightforward way
to incorporate context dependence into the account. An epsilon term represents an
arbitrary witness of some predicate and we can straightforwardly deﬁne this predicate
as being dependent on the immediate context. Thus it is straightforward to deﬁne
structures such as ‘Kuku is laughing (at whatever it is that Kuku is laughing at in this
instance)’ or ‘Drums are beaten (by whatever it is that beats drums)’.
       In terms of the Katcha data, the approach outlined here allows us to neatly capture
the diﬀerence between (for example) an antipassive verb and a transitive verb with no
overt object. A transitive verb decorates its logical object node with a metavariable: a
term whose content is underspeciﬁed and requires subsequent update. In the case of
a transitive verb without an overt object, this update will come from context. In the
case of the antipassive, the update comes from the suﬃx, which supplies a contextually
deﬁned epsilon term. The same is true for the other suﬃxes which reduce semantic
valency, unaccusative and middle voice. Although the denotational content of the
epsilon term is minimal, it decorates the object node and so prevents it from being
instantiated from context by something with more substantive content. Thus ‘Kuku
is laughing’ is semantically diﬀerent to ‘Kuku is laughing at something’, despite the
same inherently transitive verb and an equally indeterminate ‘object’ being used in
both cases.12
       The semantic diﬀerence between a transitive verb with an unspeciﬁed object and a
verb of reduced valency is not restricted to Katcha, nor to languages with morphological
antipassives. Fodor and Fodor (1980) note in regard to scope eﬀects that the same is
  12
    The analysis as it currently stands has antipassives denoting some arbitrary patient, while the
pro-dropped object of a transitive verb must have a referential interpretation. It may be that this is
too strong. Intuitively, one might expect a transitive verb with no object to have the interpretation
I have ascribed to antipassives (there is some patient but we do not know or care what it is), and
for antipassives to be genuinely intransitive. Determining whether this is the case will require further
empirical study on the referentiality of pro-dropped arguments.
8.6. Conclusion                                                                       179true for detransitivized verbs in English; there are important semantic distinctions to be
made between between ‘Everyone was reading’ and ‘Everyone was reading something’.
Steedman (2011, 2015) provides an analysis of such detransitivized English sentences
in which he construes the implied objects as Skolem terms. There are clear parallels
between Steedman’s analysis and the one given here insofar as both construe a ‘miss-
ing’ argument as being represented by an arbitrary semantic object with properties
dependent on context. The Dynamic Syntax use of epsilon terms though is arguably
more transparent in that an epsilon term speciﬁes its properties within the proposition
that forms its restrictor. As shown above, it is quite straightforward to deﬁne lexical
actions which specify the properties of the restrictor and thereby use this formalism to
model highly context-dependent semantic objects.
Chapter 9Adjuncts, Prepositions and CaseIntroduction
The purpose of this chapter is to outline a Dynamic Syntax approach to prepositional
phrases. To date, the only serious attempt at analysing prepositional phrases within
Dynamic Syntax is that of Marten (2002), who treats them as optional arguments of
the main predicate. This chapter proposes an alternative which construes prepositional
phrases as adjuncts, an approach which more closely reﬂects the observations of Lakoﬀ
and Ross (1976) that most prepositional phrases are adverbial and situated outside the
verb phrase. A prepositional phrase constructs semantic structure which is separate
from the main propositional tree but connected to the node it modiﬁes by means of
a LINK relation. The analysis is developed by applying it not only to prepositional
phrases, but also to other relevant constructions in the Katcha data.
   Section 9.1 demonstrates how this approach applies to prepositional phrases which
have an intersective, or adjectival, interpretation. These are prepositional phrases which
modify a term. This term may be an individual but is more commonly an event (again,
this is in line with the observations of Lakoﬀ and Ross (1976)). The prepositional
phrases are construed as building a LINKed propositional tree that provides extra
information about some argument in the matrix proposition. As such they are similar
to relative clauses, and use the same technical apparatus as standard DS treatments
of relatives. The formal details of the process are reﬁned slightly in section 9.2 in
order to handle the recursive locative prepositional phrases described in section 6.4.
This reﬁnement makes use only of DS tools that have been proposed independently for
other constructions in other languages.
   Given that the approach adopted here is to treat prepositional phrases as adjuncts, it
should apply equally as well to adverbs. This is taken up in section 9.3, with a discussion
of prepositional phrases which modify predicates and which therefore have a subsective,
or adverbial, interpretation. They are construed as building a LINKed tree providing
                                           181
182                              Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Caseextra information about some predicate in the matrix proposition. Section 9.4 then
extends this to locative adverbs. These words have been described by some authors as
postpositions, but it was argued in section 6.4 that they are in fact adverbs. Locative
adverbs are easily dealt with under an analysis that construes them as modifying a
predicate projected by the locative preposition, thus bringing together the analyses of
the two types of modiﬁcation.
   The ﬁnal two sections of the chapter apply the analysis to two constructions related
to prepositional phrases. Section 9.5 discusses applicatives, arguing that these may
be treated much like prepositions, the only real diﬀerence being that the applicative
morpheme does not form a syntactic constituent with its complement. Section 9.6 then
goes on to look at case. The DS construal of case as a ﬁlter on well-formed structure is
discussed with respect to the analysis of prepositional phrases developed here and it is
suggested that this may shed light on indirect and applied objects, topicalised subjects
and the form of personal pronouns in Katcha.","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"

7.2 Valency reducing suﬃxes7.2.1 Antipassive
A verb suﬃxed with an Antipassive marker corresponds to Stevenson’s “Intransitive
Stem” (Stevenson 1941:110). There are two main Antipassive suﬃxes, the choice of
which appears to be lexically determined by the verb. Probably the more common is
-VnV (7.8b-7.11b), while -VkV (7.12b-7.13b) is also attested. In both cases the quality
of the vowel in the suﬃx varies according to the vowel(s) in the verb root. The tone on
the suﬃx also varies but there does not seem to be any clear pattern to this variation.(7.8) a. akká      m-ʊ́ ʊ́      mɪ ́kɪle

              Kuku 3m.sow-antip
              ‘Kuku is sowing’A possible further example of an antipassive suﬃx is -rɪ as found in akʊ́rɪ ́ ‘eat (intrans)’
(7.14b). This appears to be a unique suﬃx: no other examples of an antipassive -rɪ are
attested in my data, and Stevenson also states that it it is ‘an unusual form’ (Stevenson
1941:110). In addition, there is no sign of the vowel harmony between suﬃx and root
which appears to exist for -VnV and -VkV. It may therefore be better to think of akʊ́rɪ ́
as a separate intransitive verb (though one clearly related to the transitive akʊ́).(7.14) a. kʊ́kkʊ́ akʊ́          mɪ ́teene

132                                        Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Verb ExtensionsAs stated in section 7.1, the simple form of the Katcha verb is always the transitive.
This is rather striking in examples such as ‘wake’ (7.10a) and ‘laugh’ (7.11a). It is not
hard to conceive that a language might treat the intransitive ‘wake’ as the less complex
form, rendering the transitive with a causative or similar device. Similarly, it seems
intuitive that in English, intransitive ‘laugh’ is semantically more basic than transitive
‘laugh at’, a fact which is reﬂected in the morphosyntax. This is not the case in Katcha.
Morphologically at least, the transitive is always the simpler form, with the intransitive
being formed by the use of the Antipassive suﬃx.
   Semantically, the Antipassive is used where the identity of the semantic theme or
patient is unknown or unimportant to the point of non-existence. As a (relatively) fully
pro-drop language, a clause in which the patient is known or implied may be expressed
using an ordinary transitive verb. (7.15a) gives an example of a verb whose object,
being implied, is simply ‘dropped’. (For comparison, (7.15b) shows the same verb with
a full complement of overt object arguments.)(7.15) a. n-aɗáŋŋá êːne
            1s-give    3p
            ‘I give (it) to them’                                          (THIEF:1.19)
        b. m-aɗáŋŋá nuk-urúːnú ʊ́ŋŋɔ́          k-áʈábbʊ́
            3f-give       pl-year         1pl.excl 3p-be.many
            ‘she gives many years to us’                                  (TEACH:1.60)Both the transitive and the antipassive forms of the verb, then, may occur with no
overt syntactic object. The key distinction between them is semantic: a transitive verb
with an implied semantic object is expressed using an unmarked transitive form; a
transitive verb with no object (implied or otherwise) is expressed using a verb with an
Antipassive suﬃx.
   Stevenson (1956-57:58) states that the Antipassive suﬃx (which he calls ‘Qualita-
tive’) may in fact be used with ‘indeﬁnite objects’, in which case it has a general or
habitual interpretation. He gives one example:(7.16) bibala iyana                  fɔ
        ɓɪːɓala ɪja-ana             eːfɔ
        boy     3m.milk-antip cows
        ‘The boy milks cows, (i.e. he cow-milks in general).’      (Stevenson 1956-57:58)Although (7.16) has a syntactic object, it seems clear that the sentence does not
refer to an event in which any individual actually undergoes milking, i.e. the semantic
theme/patient has no denotation. To that extent, this construction is still in keeping
7.2. Valency reducing suﬃxes                                                                     133with the function of these suﬃxes. It is probably still appropriate to think of the suﬃx
as marking antipassive.27.2.2 Passive (‘Personal Passive’)
The suﬃx -tené marks a verb as passive. The subject agreement marker on the verb
agrees with the syntactic subject, which carries the thematic role of theme/patient:(7.17) a. akká        m-ʊnɪ     kʊ́rɪ
             woman 3f-cook food
             ‘a woman is cooking food’
         b. kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-t n ́
             food 3m.pfv-cook-pass
             ‘the food is being cooked’
(7.18) a. ómúɗi ́ abʊ́       ámbâ
             man      3m.hit drum
             ‘the man is hitting a drum’
         b. ambá m-abʊ-t n ́ ká         tábeːne
             drum 3f-hit-pass loc wrestling
             ‘the drum is being hit for wrestling’The -tené suﬃx is used where there is an implied agent and as such is described by
Stevenson as a “true passive” (Stevenson 1941:113). He states that ‘it often implies
that someone is implicated in the action, and may have a noun complement’ (Stevenson
1941:113), giving (7.19) as an example which includes an explicit agent introduced by
the dative preposition a or locative preposition ka:(7.19) bibala abadh n            a        pupa thi                         yeni

not agree with my ﬁeldwork ﬁndings. In controlled elicitation sessions, I was unable
to elicit a passive sentence with an explicit agent, nor have I found any clearcut

134                                        Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Verb Extensionsexamples in the Katcha texts. In the Gospel of Luke for example, there are something
over a hundred occurences of verbs with passive morphology3 , but only two examples
have noun complements which might be considered to be the agent.                         Neither are
unambiguous. To give an example, the noun phrase kadu nyeꞌdꞌde... in (7.20) appears
to be a potential candidate for the agent of kussudene. The sentence would then
mean ‘God’s wisdom is known by all who accept God’s words’. However, we cannot
discount the possibility that this noun phrase plays a more oblique semantic role, such
as cause. That is, ‘God’s wisdom is known because of those who accept his words’,
with the knower(s) being an implied third party. Indeed, if the English translation and
the Katcha translation accurately paraphrase the same proposition, the latter is the
favoured reading.(7.20) ataꞌdara ma         ogo kussudene            [ka     kadu     nyeꞌdꞌde kungngo

         ‘God’s wisdom is shown to be true by all who accept it.’                       (LUKE 7:35)It seems then that the agent of a passive construction is made explicit very rarely, if at
all. If the agent of an event is important enough to the discourse to be made explicit,
the passive suﬃx is unlikely to be used. An analysis of discourse structure lies outwith
the scope of this study, but given that syntactic subjects can occur after the verb as
well as before, it is perhaps a plausible speculation that word order, rather than verbal
morphology, is the device used to signal the relative prominence of verbal arguments.
   3
     There are in fact 202 instances of words carrying the -tene passive suﬃx, but a number of these
are derived nominal forms, such as katalaadene, ‘disciples’ (from laala, ‘teach’, thus ‘people who are
taught’)
7.2. Valency reducing suﬃxes                                                          1357.2.3 Unaccusative (‘Impersonal Passive’)
Although the agent of a verb marked with Passive -tené is seldom stated explicitly, it
appears that its existence is nevertheless always implied. This contrasts with the other
passive-like suﬃx -nca, which is described by Stevenson as ‘Stative or Neuter-Passive’
(Stevenson 1956-57:57). It has no obvious agent and in this sense can be thought of as
an ‘impersonal’ type of passive. Perhaps the most useful term to use to describe this
form is ‘Unaccusative’.
   Unaccusatives are deﬁned by Perlmutter, within the framework of Relational Gram-
mar, as containing ‘a 2-arc but no 1-arc’ (Perlmutter 1978:160). That is to say, they
have an underlying direct object (usually the semantic Patient) which is ‘advanced’ to
the position of subject but, unlike passives, have no Agent argument to be ‘demoted’
to an oblique position. Expressing this in more theory-neutral terms, an Unaccusative
verb can be deﬁned as one whose syntactic subject is its Patient/Theme argument and
which has no Agent argument. This is exactly the situation which occurs with the
Katcha -nca suﬃx and so ‘Unaccusative’ would seem to be an appropriate name for
this suﬃx.
   The contrast in meaning between Passive and Unaccusative forms can be seen in
(7.21-7.23). Stevenson (1941:113-114) suggests that ‘the general implication’ of a verb
marked with -nca ‘is ﬁnality, or state.’ Clearly, this does not mean that a verb marked
with -nca must carry a stative/generic meaning: whilst this does appear to be the case
for (7.23), examples (7.21-7.22) both refer to single events. Rather, it is a question of
how the event is viewed. In the passive (7.21a/b, 7.22a) the focus is on the event itself,
which is seen as an action and therefore has an implied agent. In the unaccusative
(7.21c, 7.22b) the focus is on the result of the event, which is seen as a process and
therefore has no implied agent. In both the passive and the unaccusative, the syntactic
subject is the semantic undergoer (i.e. the patient) of the event described by the verb.(7.21) a. kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-t n ́
             food 3m.cook-pass
             ‘the food is being cooked’

               drum 3f-hit-unacc loc wrestling
               ‘the drum is hit for wrestling’ (habitually)The Unaccusative is frequently followed by a locative adverb5 , such as kʊ́ɓʊ́, ‘down’
in (7.21c) and (7.22b). This does not appear to be obligatory, and never appears when
there is some other complement of the verb (as in (7.23b)). However, where there is no
complement, it seems to be strongly preferred.
      There is a connection between the Unaccusative and the Antipassive, which mani-
fests in two ways. The ﬁrst is morphological. Stevenson states that the Unaccusative
suﬃx is ‘by preference attached to intransitive verbs’ (Stevenson 1941:114). An example
of this is shown in (7.22b). According to my data, the preference is not quite as strong
as Stevenson’s statement suggests; indeed, his own data includes as many verbs with
-nca attached to a transitive stem as to an intransitive one. Stevenson’s examples of
verbs where -nca attaches to an Antipassive suﬃx largely concur with mine, suggesting
that this is perhaps a lexical preference. Nonetheless, there appear to be a reasonable
number of these, so it seems fair to say that there is at least some correlation between
these two forms of the verb.
    The second way in which Unaccusative and Antipassive are connected is a semantic
one, seen in (7.23b). Like the Antipassive (see example 7.16), the Unaccusative can
be used to describe events with a general scope or of a habitual nature. Thus while
(7.23a) describes a present event, (7.23b) describes a habitual situation.
  4
      Tones and vowel length are uncertain for this verb form.

The suﬃx -ncaːna denotes a type of Middle Voice. Unfortunately, the term ‘middle’
has been used in very diﬀerent ways by diﬀerent authors. To compare three diﬀerent
dictionaries of linguistics, for example: Crystal (2008) mentions only that the Greek
middle ‘included verbs with a reﬂexive meaning’ (eg. She cut herself ); Brown and Miller
(2013) deﬁne middles as verbs whose subject ‘denotes a participant that is neither agent
nor patient but controls the situation’ (eg. One bomb didn’t guide and crashed); ﬁnally,
Matthews (2014) suggests that middles may include both ‘intransitive constructions
that are understood reﬂexively’ (eg. I shaved) and intransitives with ‘a passive-like
relation to [the] subject’ (eg. This stone cuts easily). The typology of voice alternations
in WALS (Siewierska 2013) equates middles with anticausatives, describing them in
similar terms as the unaccusatives discussed in the previous section. In summary,
‘there is no generally accepted deﬁnition or characterization of middle voice, let alone
a satisfactory account of the relations among the various phenomena that have been
given that name’ (Kemmer 1993:1).
   Kemmer (1993:16-20) lists no fewer than thirteen phenomena which languages may
mark morphologically as ‘middles’, including both lexically determined semantic classes
of verbs (eg. ‘grooming’ verbs) and syntactic processes (eg. impersonal middles such as
the book is selling well). She claims that there are two properties common to all of these,
namely ‘1) Initiator as aﬀected entity (Endpoint) and 2) low degree of elaboration of
events’ (Kemmer 1993:238). According to Kemmer then, middles share some simliarity
with reﬂexives and reciprocals but diﬀer in their ‘elaboration of events’. Middles express
events using fewer ﬁne-grained distinctions than reﬂexives or reciprocals do. A reﬂexive
construction such as John washes himself expresses a relation between two participants,
John as agent and himself as patient, and indicates that both participants happen to
denote the same indivdual. On the other hand, a construction which presents the event
more as the action of a single participant (John washes) is likely to be marked as a
middle. Similarly, Kemmer argues that reciprocal marking presents an event as being
made up of two or more relations: John and Mary kissed each other entails John kissed
Mary and Mary kissed John, i.e. a kissing relation holds between John and Mary and
a separate (but possibly concurrent) kissing relation holds between Mary and John.
On the other hand, middle marking presents an event as involving a single, though
two-way, relation between the two participants: John and Mary kissed implies a single
act of kissing. Thus for Kemmer, the key characteristic of middles is that they describe
an event with relatively little elaboration.
   Finally, Payne describes middles as encoding ‘a process undergone by the patient,
rather than […] an action carried out by an agent’ (Payne 1997:216). That is, the
key characteristics of middles for Payne are that they present a situation as a largely
non-agentive process, with the focus therefore on the aﬀected participant.
138                                        Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Verb Extensions    Kemmer’s and Payne’s deﬁnitions of middle voice are not exactly the same as one
another but taken together they seem to describe the Katcha data. In Katcha, verbs
marked with -ncaːna express the notion that the subject is both ‘initiator’ and ‘end-
point’ to the extent that, in the draft Katcha New Testament, <njaana> is sometimes
written as a separate word and glossed as ‘one another’. However, the verb appears to
express a single event with a single participant, with the subject an aﬀected participant
rather than an agent. Examples are given in (7.24-7.26).6(7.24) a        tumma no               tanyalanjaana   kuꞌbu ka       ꞌbuugu koona nyeꞌdꞌde

         ‘the rocks split apart’                                                  (MATT 27.51)    Middle Voice is syntactically detransitivising; it takes no syntactic object and the
syntactic subject (whilst arguably also the the agent-like argument) has a clear patient-
like status. Thus the verb asanːa, glossed as ‘disperse’ in (7.26), is elsewhere used
transitively to mean ‘spray’ (eg. m-asanːa kɔnʈɔ ‘3f-spray perfume’). Likewise in
(7.27), which is the active equivalent of (7.24), it can be seen that the morphologically
simple verb aɲala is transitive, taking an overt object tʊmːa ‘words/news’. In (7.24),
where aɲalancaːna carries the Middle Voice suﬃx, there is no syntactic object and
tʊmːa has become the syntactic subject.
   6
     I have no examples of Middle in my ﬁeldwork data; it was almost two years after returning from
ﬁeldwork that I noticed its existence in the draft Katcha New Testament! All data in this section is
taken from the text of the draft Katcha New Testament and tones are not marked.

logically, the forms of the two suﬃxes appear to be related (/ncaːna/ and /nca/
respectively). Syntactically, the Middle, like the Unaccusative, is generally followed
by a locative adverb; most commonly this is kʊɓʊ ‘down’, as in (7.24-7.26) but there
are examples where a Middle verb is followed by kɔɗɔ ‘up’. Semantically, both the
Unaccusative and the Middle downplay the role of the agent, to the extent that there
is arguably either no agent at all or the agent is subsumed under the patient.
      My data on middle voice in particular is quite limited, but perhaps the diﬀerence
between the unaccusative and the middle is that middle voice focuses more on the pro-
cess described by the verb, while the unaccusative generally describes an achievement
with more of a focus on the state resulting from an action.","[147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158]"

8.2 Antipassive(8.16) kʊ́kkʊ́ ɪ ́kɪ ́cé-éné
           Kuku laugh.at-antip
           ‘Kuku is laughing’As noted in section 7.2.1, the antipassive indicates that the identity of the semantic
theme/patient is unknown or unimportant to the point of non-existence. However, as
also noted there, the basic form of Katcha verbs is transitive; to analyse a verb like
ɪ ́kɪ ́céen
           ́ é as a simple one-place predicate would seem to go against the general pattern
of Katcha verbs.
       The central insight in the analysis of a sentence like (8.16) therefore is that the
antipassive provides the semantic object for the verb and that this object is indeﬁnite,
arbitrary and completely dependent on the immediate context of the predicate and
its co-arguments in the given situation. In other words, the interpretation of (8.16)
is something like ‘Kuku is laughing (at whatever it is that Kuku is laughing at in
this instance)’. Such an analysis is proposed within CCG by Steedman (2011) for
detransitivised verbs in English (such as ‘John is reading’), using dependent Skolem
terms to represent the indeﬁnite object. The Dynamic Syntax formalism, with its use
of the epsilon calculus to represent noun phrases, is well-suited to this type of analysis.
Furthermore, it is common within Dynamic Syntax to assume that propositions include
an additional argument which stands for the situation of evaluation (Gregoromichelaki
2006, 2011; Cann 2011). This situation argument is assumed to be of type es , that is
a subtype of type e. Cann (2011) argues that the semantic content of the situation
argument, like all other arguments of a proposition, should be modelled as an epsilon
term.5 For ease of exposition I ignore the internal content of the situation argument,
simply representing its formula value as an indexed variable, si . Where appropriate I
add informal restrictions, such as si,event(i) or si,state(i) . Incorporating this situation
argument into our account allows us to express the context-dependent nature of the
‘missing’ object quite naturally.
   5
    This allows features such as tense to be construed as a restrictor on the temporal relation between
the event and the time of utterance or other reference point.
158                                                      Theoretical Analyses: Verb Extensions      Taking these assumptions into account, the antipassive suﬃx can be construed as
decorating the internal argument node with some contextually dependent epsilon term.
In the case of sentence (8.16), this will be the term given in (8.17), leading to the logical
form shown in (8.18):6(8.17) ϵx , Laugh.at′ (x)(Kuku′ )(si )
(8.18)          F o(Laugh.at′ (a)(Kuku′ )(si )), T y(t), ♢
                                       F o(Laugh.at′ (a)(Kuku′ )),
              F o(si ), T y(es )
                                              T y(es → t)                                                         F o(Laugh.at′ (a)),
                               F o(Kuku′ ), T y(e)
                                                         T y(e → (es → t))                                                     F o(a),         F o(Laugh.at′ ),
                                                     T y(e)     T y(e → (e → (es → t)))                              where a = ϵx , Laugh.at′ (x)(Kuku′ )(si )
As noted in section 8.1, an epsilon term ϵx , F (x) represents some arbitrary individual,
x, of which the property F holds. The epsilon term in (8.17), which forms the internal
argument of the proposition at the root node of (8.18) represents the object of Kuku’s
laughing: some arbitrary x such that, in situation si , Kuku′ laughs at x, in other words
‘whatever it is Kuku is laughing at in this instance’. Importantly (given the semantics
of the antipassive discussed in section 7.2.1), this term is completely dependent on the
immediate context of the tree in which it occurs, drawing its content from the formula
values of the other terminal nodes in the tree.
      The lexical actions associated with the antipassive suﬃx (8.19) achieve this context
dependence by copying formula values from elsewhere in the partial tree. This lexical
entry states that the pointer must be at the logical subject node (that is, a type e node
whose mother is of type es → t) and that there must be some formula σ of type es
decorating the situation argument node and some formula ϕ of type e → (e → (es → t))
decorating the predicate node. If these conditions are met, the pointer moves to the
logical object node and decorates it with an epsilon term which incorporates the formula
value of the predicate (ϕ) as its restrictor and the values of the situation argument (σ)
and logical subject (α) as arguments:
  6
    In order to declutter the tree diagrams, I suppress the λ-operators and their bound variables
when representing predicate formulae. Thus in (8.18) the formula Laugh.at′ should be taken as an
abbreviation for λx.λy.Laugh.at′ (x)(y). Functors always appear to the right of their arguments in the
tree, and semantic types are stated explicitly on each node, so this should not lead to any ambiguity.

                ELSE      abortAs a verbal suﬃx, the antipassive marker is parsed after the verb root. It is straightfor-
ward to specify the value of ϕ because the predicate node will have been decorated with
a formula value when the verb root was parsed. The lexical actions in (8.19) can then
easily refer to this value and incorporate it into the epsilon term with which it decorates
the logical object node. Likewise, I assume that the situation argument has some ﬁxed
content, and copying this value (σ) into the epsilon term is equally straightforward.
   Specifying the value of the agent (α) is more problematic. At the point when the
antipassive morpheme is parsed, this value may well be merely a metavariable. The
lexical actions in (8.19) would then incorporate this metavariable into the epsilon term
to give a formula such as (8.20).(8.20) ϵx , Laugh.at′ (x)(U)(si ).   (8.20) represents ‘the object of U’s laughter in si .’ The problem with this is that
a metavariable has no semantic content; it is merely a placeholder for some formula.
Moreover, as an argument within the epsilon term, the metavariable U in (8.20) is not
available for substitution and hence the entire epsilon term is uninterpretable. It is
therefore not enough for the lexical actions in (8.19) to decorate the logical object node
with an unexpanded epsilon term. Instead, they must make reference to the fact that
epsilon terms have internal structure.
   In an ϵ-term ϵx , F (x), F is a restrictor function over the free variable x. ϵ is an
operator which binds x and turns the proposition F (x) into a term. It is possible to
represent all of this schematically using a DS-style tree notation (8.21). As is standard,
functors are on the right and arguments on the left.

 The lexical entry for the antipassive morpheme can be adjusted so that rather than
just decorating the logical object node with a formula value, it constructs a full epsilon
structure of the kind represented in (8.21). The revised lexical entry is given in (8.22).
At ﬁrst, the structure built by these actions looks rather diﬀerent from the standard
epsilon structure in (8.21). However, the diﬀerence is only apparent. The epsilon binder
is of type t → e, predicating over an open proposition. For the majority of epsilon
structures, such as those projected by quantiﬁed noun phrases, the open proposition
describes a property of the unbound variable, because the common noun projects a one-
place predicate. But there is nothing in principle to limit this proposition to describing
a property. In the current case, the predicate within the epsilon term is a copy of the
three-place predicate projected by the verb and so the open proposition describes a
three-place relation in which the unbound variable participates.

formula and type values to the version I give here.

tally. After parsing the subject and verb, the partial tree in (8.23) has been constructed,
with the pointer on the subject node where it is left by the lexical actions of the verb.","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180]"

9.5 Applicatives
Prototypical applicatives are valency increasing devices, which potentially constitutes
a challenge to Dynamic Syntax. DS takes a strictly monotonic incremental approach to
parsing. If the verb root and the applicative suﬃx are separate parsable morphemes,
they must be processed in linear order. This would entail parsing the verb root ﬁrst,
following the associated lexical actions and building a propositional structure with
either one or two argument nodes (for intransitive and transitive verbs respectively).
The question of how the applicative morpheme could then add an additional argument
node is non-trivial.
   With this in mind, it is interesting to note that in chapter 7 applicative verb forms
were described as possibly being more lexicalised than other verb extensions. Whereas
the majority of verb extensions, with the possible exception of antipassive, appear
to be phonologically discrete morphemes which may be suﬃxed to any semantically
appropriate verb, the applicative has a number of forms, the choice of which is lexically
driven. Moreover, unlike most verb extensions, some forms of the applicative harmonise
with the vowels of the root suggesting a closer ‘connection’ between the root and the
aﬃx. Following Kaye’s (1989; 1995) hypothesis that the main purpose of phonological
phenomena is to facilitate parsing, these facts might be taken as evidence that the
applicative suﬃx is not stored as a separate lexical entry, but that applicative verb
forms are stored in the lexicon as a unit.
   If this is so, it is straightforward to deﬁne a lexical entry (9.32) for an applicative
verb such as mʊnɪtá in (9.31) which constructs a partial tree with three argument nodes
as in (9.33).(9.31) akká     m-ʊnɪ-tá        kʊ́rɪ a    kʊ́kkʊ̂

A couple of comments can be made about this approach. The extra, dative argument
appears to be obligatory, that is, pro-drop is not permitted for indirect objects.6 The
verb therefore decorates the indirect object node with a requirement for a formula
of type e rather than with a metavariable. Also, if a lexical analysis is the correct
approach, it implies that the dative a in this case is simply a case marker of the noun,
marking the fact that it decorates the lowest argument node (the indirect object) of
   6
    I have not found any examples of an applicative verb with an implied indirect object, and given that
the purpose of the applicative is to license an extra argument, it would be surprising if this argument
was minor enough to be silent.

‘give’, is also marked with a, this is not an unreasonable conclusion. Case is discussed
further in section 9.6.
       A lexical analysis of applicative verbs is quite straightforward to implement in
Dynamic Syntax and in the case of Katcha there are possibly some morphophonological
arguments in favour of such an analysis. However, it is still worth considering whether
an analytic approach may be possible. Even if Katcha applicatives are lexical rather
than analytic, it is unlikely that applicatives are lexical in all languages, so a preliminary
sense of how applicative morphemes might contribute to the semantics of a proposition
is no bad thing. Indeed, considering any linguistic phenomenon from the point of view
of a novel theoretical framework might provide new insights that would otherwise be
missed.
       One approach to providing an analytic characterisation of the applicative is that
presented by Marten (2002). Marten gives Swahili applicative verbs a lexical analysis
on the basis that ‘the applicative morpheme does not provide lexical access because it
does not constitute a phonological domain’ (Marten 2002:187), but he does give a sketch
of how an analytic construal of the applicative might proceed (Marten 2002:184-185).
His version of DS incorporates an underspeciﬁed semantic type e∗ . According to this
view, a verb projects a semantic predicate of the underspeciﬁed type e → (e∗ → t)),
allowing it to take any number of arguments. Furthermore, the predicate decorates an
unﬁxed node in the ﬁrst instance. The tree node address and the semantic type for
the verb are then resolved after all arguments have been processed. For ‘standard’ DS,
however, adding an additional argument after the verb has been parsed - if we assume
that this is the applicative’s function - would seem to constitute a major challenge to
the Dynamic Syntax framework.
       An alternative approach would be to assume that the nominals licensed by ap-
plicatives should, on a semantic level, be analysed not as arguments of the verb but
as adjuncts. Languages with applicatives prototypically have semantically equivalent
non-applicative constructions where the peripheral arguments are marked as oblique
by means of, for example, adpositions. The alternation between the applicative con-
struction and its adpositional equivalent generally conveys discourse-level or pragmatic
eﬀects (Peterson 2006:45-51; see also Marten 2002:192-198 for Swahili examples). As
such, in a framework like Dynamic Syntax where the only level of representation is
semantic, the parsing of an applicative construction and the equivalent adpositional
construction should ultimately derive the same logical form. The same analysis given
to prepositional phrases should also be given to applied objects.7
   7
    In fact, this is exactly what Marten (2002) does, though from the other direction. Rather than
treating applicatives as adjuncts like prepositional phrases, prepositional phrases (and all ‘adjuncts’),
are treated as additional arguments.

(9.32-9.33), an analytic approach would treat it as a two-place predicate with the
applicative morpheme signalling the presence of an adjunct (in DS terms, constructing
a LINKed tree).
   The parsing of (9.31) under such an approach would begin with the parsing of the
subject and verb, leading to the tree in (9.34).","[222, 223, 224, 225]"

1.4 Overall aims
This study is very much data-led. It does not set out with a speciﬁc hypothesis to be
tested (other than the very general hypothesis that Dynamic Syntax may be a suitable
framework for the analysis of phenomena found in Nilo-Saharan languages). Rather,
the goal has been to investigate the Katcha language with an open mind, ﬁnd out what
is interesting about it and then try to provide a Dynamic Syntax analysis for that.
    The order in which the study is presented, with the morphosyntactic descriptions
in part II separate from the theoretical analyses in part III, reﬂects this process.
It also serves to make the study more accessible. In order to be of beneﬁt to the
widest possible range of readership, I have endeavoured to keep the descriptive analysis
as general and atheoretical as possible. It is hoped that those whose interest is in
questions of typology, the description of Nuba languages or the genetic aﬃliation of
Kadu, but who do not have a background in Dynamic Syntax or formal semantics,
may ﬁnd at least the ﬁrst two-thirds of the thesis to be of use and of interest. It is
hoped that the new data presented here will add to our knowledge and understanding
of Nuba Mountain languages. Furthermore, in describing and analysing some of the
typologically unsual features of Katcha’s nominal system, this thesis aims to challenge
some standard assumptions about these constructions and contribute to the debate
about the language’s genetic aﬃliation.
    Of course, data is not described in a vacuum; the general theoretical assumptions
held by the researcher — any researcher — frame the questions he or she asks and
inﬂuence the descriptive analysis. Although I aim to present the morphosyntactic
descriptions in a relatively atheoretical way, the general assumptions underlying these
descriptions are those of Dynamic Syntax, taking incrementality and dynamic processes
seriously. It is to be hoped that adopting such assumptions will yield insights in the
morphosyntactic descriptions that might otherwise be missed.
    The main aim of the theoretical analyses in part III is to test the suitability of

also extending and reﬁning the theory where necessary. In testing DS as a model,
the main criterion must be the extent to which the theoretical tools provided by DS
are suﬃcient to model the Katcha data. Where it is necessary to make adjustments
to those tools, the aim is to improve the theory and make it better suited to real-life
language.
   The typological and theoretical ﬁndings which result from the application of a
theoretical framework to new language data naturally have implications for a wider
theory of language. Some brief comments on these are made at the end of the study in
chapter 11.
Chapter 2BackgroundIntroduction
This chapter provides relevant background information to contextualise the current
study. Section 2.1 gives some demographics, brieﬂy outlining the current situation of
Katcha speakers and touching on the impact of this on the language. The following
sections then go on to describe the current state of linguistic research on Katcha.
The majority of published research relevant to Katcha has been in the area of genetic
classiﬁcation, and this work is discussed in section 2.2. The discussion then moves on
to summarize the descriptions and analyses that have been produced for Katcha (and
related languages) up to this point. Much of this work is unpublished but has proven
to be important to the current study, particularly the archive of materials collected
by Roland Stevenson. It will be seen through the discussion of sections 2.2–2.3 that
while the genetic aﬃliation of Katcha and its relatives has been the topic of some
vigorous debate, and there has been a moderate level of investigation of phonology,
much less work has been carried out in the area of morphosyntax. (Indeed, I am
aware of only one published paper on any area of Katcha morphosyntax, and that has
only been published since I began the research for this study, namely Gilley (2013).)
These sections therefore lay out the context for the current project and lead naturally
to a summary of my ﬁeldwork and the novel data this study will contribute (section
2.4). The chapter concludes with some indications as to how the issues discussed are
impacted by this thesis.","[27, 28, 29, 30]"
"11.3.1 Taking a dynamic approach
In any scientiﬁc enterprise, theory and data should be in a symbiotic relationship: the
theory should explain and make sense of the data, but the data should lead and shape
the theory. In research like that presented in the present study, whose main aim is the
application of a particular theoretical framework to novel data, the continual interaction
between theory and data must be a guiding principle.
   The way in which the data acts to shape the theory is relatively obvious. Chapters
8–10 provide Dynamic Syntax analyses of various morphosyntactic phenomena found
11.3. Concluding comments                                                              257in Katcha nominals. Some of these analyses are straightforward implementations of
Dynamic Syntax as it has previously been used in the analysis of various languages,
but others involve adjusting or extending the framework. Such extensions have been
noted in the course of presenting the analyses. A clear example is the discussion in
section 10.2, which extends the analysis of demonstrative pronouns from the projection
of a simple metavariable to a more complex set of actions projecting a partial epsilon
term including a nominal variable and epsilon binder in addition to the metavariable.
It was noted in that section that this construal of demonstrative pronouns entails a
reformulation of the notion of substitution, and that this may be a challenge to the
Dynamic Syntax formalism.
   The way in which the theory acts on the data may be less blatant, but it is
important to make it as explicit as possible. From an epistemological point of view,
it is not possible to look at data in a completely objective, non-theoretical manner.
The very act of using metalinguistic notions such as ‘noun’ to describe some element
of the language being studied implies theoretical assumptions at some level. Indeed,
it would be impossible to discuss the data at all without engaging in such theoretical
abstraction. The whole point of theory is to provide a systematic framework for these
assumptions, allowing the researcher to explain and make sense of the data. As such,
I have tried throughout this thesis to maintain an awareness of how the descriptive
analyses presented may have been inﬂuenced by the theoretical approach adopted.
Maintaining a balance between data and theory has been a key objective throughout.
   This objective may have been concealed somewhat by the order of presentation,
which purports to separate out the descriptions of the data in part II from the theoret-
ical analyses in part III. This somewhat artiﬁcial separation was made for two reasons.
The ﬁrst is a practical one. In order to make the study accessible and of beneﬁt to
the widest possible range of readership, I have endeavoured to keep the descriptive
analysis as general and atheoretical as possible. It is hoped that those whose interest
is in questions of typology, the description of Nuba languages or the genetic aﬃliation
of Kadu, but who do not have a background in Dynamic Syntax or formal semantics,
may ﬁnd at least the ﬁrst two-thirds of the thesis to be of use and of interest.
   The second reason for separating the presentation of the data from the theory is
that it reﬂects the fact that this research has been data-led. As noted at the beginning
of this chapter, the goal of this research project was not to test a speciﬁc hypothesis, but
to investigate the Katcha language with an open mind, ﬁnd out what was interesting
about it and then try to provide a Dynamic Syntax anlaysis for that. In this way,
separating the presentation of the descriptive analyses and theoretical analyses in this
study reﬂects the nature of the process as a whole.
   The descriptive analyses in chapters 4–7 are thus presented with little or no explicit
reference to Dynamic Syntax.       Nonetheless it must be acknowledged that certain
258                                                  Theoretical Analyses: Conclusionsinterpretations of the data come from approaching it with a dynamic mindset. Again,
the analysis of nominal modiﬁers is perhaps the clearest illustration of this.
   In chapter 5 it is argued that the modiﬁers of nouns in Katcha are themselves
appositional nominals. This is an inherently dynamic view. Most traditional grammat-
ical formalisms see syntax as a set of largely static relationships between words, and
therefore explain modiﬁcation in terms of hierarchical notions such as constituency.
In contrast, the analysis given here appeals not to a hierarchical relationship between
head and modiﬁer but to the incremental build-up of information during the parsing
process. One nominal (the ‘head’) is parsed, contributing semantic information to the
proposition under construction; a further nominal (the appositional ‘modiﬁer’) is then
parsed, contributing further semantic information.
   The analysis of nominal modiﬁers also relies on a sharp distinction between lexical
NPs, which do not allow ‘internal’ modiﬁcation, and pronouns, which do allow such
modiﬁcation. Again, this distinction has its source in a dynamic approach. Central to
the dynamic perspective are the notions of underspeciﬁcation and subsequent update.
Anaphoric elements are seen as semantically underspeciﬁed, requiring some subsequent
update to make them interpretable. In contrast, lexical nouns have a fully speciﬁed
semantics and so provide signiﬁcantly less scope for any further speciﬁcation of their
interpretation. From this perspective, it is intuitive rather than surprising that there
should be a diﬀerence in the way pronouns and lexical NPs undergo modiﬁcation.
   Approaching the data from a dynamic perspective thus opens up the possibility
of analysing modiﬁers as appositional nominals. This analysis provides what I believe
to be the best explanation of the facts of the Katcha data, incorporating the role of
the medial and distal demonstratives within the account of nominal modiﬁcation and
suggesting a connection between Katcha modiﬁers and the construct form found in
many African languages. These insights would in all likelihood have been missed if the
data had not been considered from a perspective whose underpinning presuppositions
are dynamic.
   It has to be recognised then, that data is not described in a vacuum; the general
theoretical assumptions held by the researcher — any researcher — frame the questions
he or she asks and inﬂuence the descriptive analysis. In this study I have attempted
to present the morphosyntactic descriptions in a relatively atheoretical way but the
general assumptions underlying these descriptions come from a position which takes
incrementality and dynamic processes seriously. Adopting such assumptions brings a
particular perspective and yields particular insights in the morphosyntactic descrip-
tions, which otherwise might be missed.

A central aspect of the incremental approach to grammar exempliﬁed by Dynamic
Syntax is that it takes seriously the fact that utterances (and the morphemes that
make them up) are parsed in context. The various analyses presented in this thesis
all involve syntactic processes which are dependent on context. Process and context
may interact in diﬀerent ways, however. In some cases, context is utilised as part of
some pragmatic process based on general principles of reasoning and inference. In other
cases, reference to context is encoded within the lexical actions of a morpheme. The
latter may be in the form of a simple trigger condition specifying the context in which
the morpheme may be parsed successfully, or it may go so far as to actually deﬁne the
value of some tree decoration.
   In cases of the ﬁrst type, the context is referred to in the course of executing
pragmatic actions. In these cases, context contributes to the interpretation of a tree,
rather than its construction. A clear example is the phenomenon of pro-drop. The
standard Dynamic Syntax construal of pronouns (Kempson et al. 2001:95-98, Cann
et al. 2005:67-73) is that they project a metavariable, a placeholder for some term
whose reference may be established (among other ways) by the Substitution of an
appropriate term. There are one or two clearly deﬁned structural constraints which
limit the application of Substitution, but otherwise it is a freely available process
guided by general pragmatic principles such as relevance. Substitution is therefore
an action which is dependent only on a general, broad context.
   Context dependence may also be encoded within the lexical actions of a morpheme.
Indeed, lexical entries by deﬁnition have a conditional structure that refers to the
context in which the lexical actions may operate. This ‘trigger condition’ may simply be
used to license the morpheme’s presence by deﬁning the context in which the morpheme
may be parsed. For example, the lexical entry for the dative case marker (9.44) merely
checks that an applicative verb has previously been parsed and does not aﬀect the
growth of the semantic structure in any way. More common is for a lexical entry to
include alternative sets of actions, the choice of which is determined by the context. So
for example, the lexical entry for a proper noun (10.26) contains two menus of lexical
actions, one of which operates when the noun occurs in an ordinary argument context,
and one which operates when the noun is interpreted as a possessor. The possessive
interpretation is marked by syntactic position, i.e. when the noun occurs following a
demonstrative pronoun, so in this case, it is syntactic context which is referred to by
the condition within the noun’s lexical entry.
   Finally, the analysis of valency-reducing verb extensions given in chapter 8 shows an
example where context dependence is even more obvious. The lexical actions associated
with these suﬃxes construct highly context-dependent epsilon terms in which the values
of the nodes within the epsilon term are taken from the tree in which it occurs. The

meaning that they can take up an argument role in a proposition while contributing
negligible semantic content, thus eﬀectively reducing the valency of the predicate.","[275, 276, 277, 278, 279]"

an open ?T y(t) node so that a following verb may be parsed. However, there is
an additional consequence of these actions which provides added motivation to this
analysis: the fact that these actions include the construction of the epsilon binder
is reﬂective of the fact that the demonstrative pronoun in Katcha is not merely an
anaphoric device but also has a determiner-like function. In languages with determiners,
the determiners project the epsilon binder. In Katcha, there are no lexical determiners
and notions such as deﬁniteness are supplied by the demonstrative (see below). It is
therefore not unexpected that it should be the lexical actions of the demonstrative
which project the epsilon binder.
   If we assume this revised deﬁnition of the demonstrative (10.17) we must make an
adjustment to our assumptions about the process of Substitution. In the account
of the demonstrative given above, it was assumed that the substituend, although
represented as an iota term, was essentially a name. Thus in (10.8), the substituend
was presented as ιx , Daisy′ (x) and treated as if it was a simple term, leaving unspeciﬁed
the question of whether the term could be analysed further. The revised account of the
demonstrative answers this unasked question in the aﬃrmative.

projected by the demonstrative must be updated to a fully speciﬁed epsilon-tree. This
implies that the term which updates the metavariable through Substitution brings
with it a full epsilon-structure of functor and argument daughter nodes. When the root
node (the epsilon term) is substituted for the metavariable, some of these daughter
nodes will ‘overlay’ the existing nodes in the partial epsilon structure projected by the
demonstrative. However, none of this duplication is inconsistent and consequently the
nodes will collapse together harmlessly (10.19).","[249, 250]"

might be expected from a verb carrying both antipassive and unaccusative morphology,
but it does not appear to capture the fact that it was stones which shattered in the
situation being described. In fact, this is only an apparent problem. Epsilon terms
carry inherent existential force, meaning that the situation described in (8.47) involves
not only a shatterer and a shatteree, but also stones. This is most clearly seen when the
formula in (8.47) is translated into a formula of standard predicate logic. Algorithmic

the agent of the shattering is unspeciﬁed. From a truth conditional point of view, this
interpretation is exactly the same as the interpretation of the unaccusative. Given the
similarities between the middle voice and the unaccusative noted in table 8.1 and in
section 7.2.4, this is a welcome result. It is notable that the treating the verb as having
both an unaccusative and an antipassive morpheme still results in an unaccusative
interpretation. As may be clear from the derivation just outlined, this is because the
unaccusative suﬃx precedes the antipassive and is processed ﬁrst. It is therefore the
unaccusative which determines the tree position of the term projected by the sentential
subject (step (8.43) above). The incremental nature of the parsing process is therefore
crucial in providing the correct interpretation.11
    The Dynamic Syntax construal of terms as having internal complexity is also key
to this explanation. The unaccusative suﬃx expresses the external argument of the
predicate (some arbitrary shatterer), while the antipassive suﬃx expresses the internal
argument of the predicate (some arbitrary shatteree). If the terms projected by these
morphemes did not have internal structure, there would be no room for a lexical argu-
ment in addition (i.e. the syntactic subject stones). But because terms are construed
as epsilon terms, it is possible for the term ϵx , Stones′ (x) to be incorporated into the
term projected by the unaccusative morpheme, and ultimately to surface in the ﬁnal
propositional formula as ∃x[Stones′ (x)]. The internal structure of arguments essentially
allows the three argument-projecting morphemes to instantiate two argument roles, and
to do so quite naturally.
    The truth conditional interpretation of (8.48) is entirely expressed by the ﬁrst two
conjuncts. The third and fourth conjuncts are superﬂuous from a semantic point of
view. But as noted above, Stevenson (1941:112) claims that the antipassive suﬃxes
‘sometimes intensify the meaning of the parent verb.’ Stevenson’s presentation of the
data on this matter is somewhat opaque and not entirely convincing. Nevertheless, it
is notable that adding the antipassive suﬃx to an unaccusative verb causes the ﬁnal
  11
     In section 7.2.5 it was noted that for some verbs, the unaccusative suﬃx appears to attach to the
antipassive, rather than to the transitive verb stem (7.22b). This causes a problem for the current
analysis. Parsing the two morphemes in order would result in the inverse of the analysis just described
for middle voice; such verbs would be expected to have an antipassive interpretation. In fact, their
interpretation is unaccusative with the apparent antipassive morpheme seeming to make no semantic
contribution. It is not clear how these data might be integrated into the analysis as it currently stands,
other than it was noted in section 7.2.5 that there is some evidence that verbs with the antipassive are
(or may be becoming) more lexicalised than other VE forms. It may be that some of these ‘antipassive’
verbs are better treated as genuinely intransitive verbs.

repetition of the action in (8.48) expresses intensivity: There are stones and the stones
are shattered and there is shattering and there is shattering. This is largely speculation,
but if it were correct it would constitute a remarkable explanation of the correlation
between the valency changing function of the middle voice and Stevenson’s claims that
-VnV may encode intensive action, an explanation that falls out naturally from the
interaction between the two detransitivizing suﬃxes.","[195, 196, 197]"

4.3 Number marking and gender
It was demonstrated in section 4.2 that nominal agreement in Katcha is based on three
gender classes and that semantic number is not relevant to agreement. However, this
is only half the story. The nouns presented in (4.12)-(4.21), some semantically singular
and some semantically plural, and the uncountable nouns presented in (4.22) are all
morphologically unmarked for number. In such cases there is no apparent correlation
between number and gender; the gender of any given noun is indeed insensitive to
its number. However, when a noun carries morphological number marking, whether
singulative or plurative, the number-marking aﬃx determines its gender. This can be
demonstrated by looking at the gender properties of the nouns given in section 4.1
above. The data are presented in this section in the same groupings as in section 4.1,
i.e. by number aﬃx, and their gender class is noted. The gender of each noun was
established by checking the gender agreement markers (as noted in table 4.1) present
on possessors (such as those given in (4.12-4.21)), on demonstratives (4.23), or on verbs

a number-marking aﬃx, gender classiﬁcation is a property of the aﬃx and not the

consistent for each aﬃx. This has the further consequence that the gender of a noun
in the plural may diﬀer from that used in the singular, in fact, this is usually the case.","[70, 71]"

      The distinction between active and antipassive, and between passive and unac-
cusative/middle voice, is an important one. Katcha is pro-drop, so any semantic
argument may be phonologically unrealised. However, the active (unmarked) form
and the passive form of the verb each take two semantic arguments. Note that while
passive may be deﬁned as reducing the verb’s syntactic valency by demoting the agent to
the status of a (usually implied) oblique argument, the semantic valency is unchanged:
there exists both an agent and a patient, even if the agent is only there by implication.
This contrasts with the other forms, the antipassive, unaccusative and middle voice,
each of which take only one semantic argument.
      Valency reduction is something of a challenge for standard formal semantics.1 A

the question of how a proposition with a ‘missing’ argument should be modelled. One
approach is to allow the ‘missing’ argument role to be taken by some object of minimal
semantic content, an object whose reference is both arbitrary and entirely context-
dependent. Thus the agent of some unaccusative verb V in a given situation s is simply
‘the V er in s’. An unaccusative sentence like ‘Drums are beaten’ can be thought of
informally as meaning ‘Drums are beaten (by the agent of drum-beating)’ or ‘Drums are
beaten (by whatever it is that beats drums)’. This contrasts with passive verbs, which
have two semantic arguments, even if the agent happens to be phonologically unrealised.
A passive sentence like ‘Drums are being beaten’ can thought of informally as ‘Drums
are being beaten (by him/her/it)’ or ‘Drums are being beaten (by someone/something)’.
    This chapter presents a Dynamic Syntax analysis of such constructions. Section
8.1 introduces the DS formalism and illustrates its use in a straightforward Katcha
sentence with an active, transitive verb. Section 8.2 introduces the concept of epsilon
terms. Dynamic Syntax construes all terms as terms of the epsilon calculus, and this
provides a straightforward way to model the kind of term described in the previous
paragraph . An epsilon term picks out an arbitrary witness of some predicate and this
predicate can be easily deﬁned as being dependent on the immediate context. Thus
the epsilon calculus allows us to deﬁne, with relative ease, structures such as ‘Kuku is
laughing (at some arbitrary object of Kuku’s laughter)’ or ‘Drums are beaten (by some
arbitrary agent of drum beating)’ and section 8.2 presents an analysis of antipassive
verbs in Katcha in these terms. It is argued that the lexical actions associated with the
antipassive suﬃx build a context-dependent epsilon structure at the logical object node.
Section 8.3 discusses passives, the implementation of which is very straightforward: it
is simply a case of moving the pointer to ensure that the sentential subject decorates
the logical object node. This analysis highlights the fact that the passive has a more
referential interpretation for the agent, in contrast with the arbitrary interpretations
of the ‘missing’ arguments of the antipassive, unaccusative and middle voice. Section
8.4 discusses unaccusative, the analysis of which is straightforward, following directly
from the discussion in the previous two sections. Section 8.5 is slightly more speculative,
considering what the analysis of middle voice might look like if it were to be treated as a
sequence of unaccusative, followed by antipassive. Somewhat remarkably, under such an
analysis, middle voice turns out to be truth conditionally equivalent to unaccusative but
to carry extra information which might be interpreted as adding intensity, as suggested
by Stevenson (cf section 7.2.5).view of predicate-argument relations.
8.1. Transitive verbs                                                                  1518.1 Transitive verbs
Dynamic Syntax (DS) (Kempson et al. 2001; Cann et al. 2005) is a representationalist,
monostratal, parsing-based theory of syntax. It is representationalist in that it purports
to represent the semantic content of natural language as structured formulae of a logical
language. It is monostratal in that there is no level of syntactic representation; there
are no syntactic ‘objects’. Rather, syntax is construed as the set of procedures which
determine how such semantic representations are built up. And it is parsing-based in
that these procedures are carried out incrementally as a string is parsed in real time.
This is the sense in which DS is dynamic. As each word or morpheme is parsed it
provides instructions for a transition from one partial semantic structure to another
until a complete logical form is reached.
   A completed semantic structure of Dynamic Syntax is a binary tree with nodes
which are decorated with terms of the epsilon calculus and which may be combined
according to the principles of the lambda calculus. Such a tree is built up step-by-step
using a limited number of general principles (computational actions), and instructions
provided by lexical material (lexical actions).
   The parse of a simple transitive sentence such as (8.1) begins, like all parses, with the
goal of establishing a proposition. This is represented in (8.2) by the expression ?T y(t)
which decorates the root node of a partial semantic tree, the question mark expressing
a requirement for that node to be decorated by something of semantic type t. T y is a
label for the category Type, whose values may be t (proposition), e (individual), e → t
(predicate), etc. A pointer, represented by ♢, marks the node of the partial semantic
structure currently under development. At this stage this is the only node in the tree.(8.1) kʊ́kkʊ́ abʊ       ambá

                                        ?T y(t), ♢
   Computational actions in Dynamic Syntax are both conditional, in the sense that
they require certain structural conditions to be met before they may apply, and optional.
One rule which may apply at this point is *Adjunction. This rule allows for the
construction of an argument node (i.e. requiring type e) whose ﬁnal position in the tree
is unknown at the time of construction. That is, it is not known which argument of the
proposition this node will ultimately represent. The underspeciﬁed relation between
the root node and the unﬁxed argument is represented by the dotted line in (8.3). The

"11.2.1 Verb extensions
Katcha verbs are inherently transitive. If it is semantically plausible for a verb to be
transitive, this is always the basic form. Katcha verb extensions decrease valency; their
function is to license the absence of a syntactic argument. Most of these VEs decrease
semantic valency in addition to syntactic valency, presenting the event described by the
verb as having only one participant (though this is not the case for the passive). Katcha
has a complete paradigm of valency decreasing verb extensions, allowing originally
254                                                 Theoretical Analyses: Conclusionstransitive verbs to have either one or two arguments and for the subject to be either
agent or patient.
   Verb extensions were analysed in chapter 8, making use of the Dynamic Syntax
construal of terms as expressions of the epsilon calculus. The inherent internal structure
of epsilon terms allows a straightforward way to incorporate context dependence into
the account. An epsilon term represents an arbitrary witness of some predicate and
we can straightforwardly deﬁne this predicate as being dependent on the immediate
context. Thus it is straightforward to deﬁne structures such as ‘Kuku is laughing (at
whatever it is that Kuku is laughing at in this instance)’ or ‘Drums are beaten (by
whatever it is that beats drums)’.
   In terms of the Katcha data, the approach outlined here allows us to neatly capture
the diﬀerence between (for example) an antipassive verb and a transitive verb with no
overt object. A transitive verb decorates its logical object node with a metavariable: a
term whose content is underspeciﬁed and requires subsequent update. In the case of
a transitive verb without an overt object, this update will come from context. In the
case of the antipassive, the update comes from the suﬃx, which supplies a contextually
deﬁned epsilon term. The same is true for the other suﬃxes which reduce semantic
valency, unaccusative and middle voice. Although the denotational content of the
epsilon term is minimal, it decorates the object node and so prevents it from being
instantiated from context by something with more substantive content. Thus ‘Kuku
is laughing’ is semantically diﬀerent to ‘Kuku is laughing at something’, despite the
same inherently transitive verb and an equally indeterminate ‘object’ being used in
both cases. This analysis might be extendable to languages without morphological
antipassives such as for detransitivized verbs in English; there are clear semantic
diﬀerences between ‘Everyone was reading’ and ‘Everyone was reading something’.
The analysis given here for Katcha construes a ‘missing’ argument as being represented
by an arbitrary semantic object with properties dependent on context. It is quite
straightforward to deﬁne lexical actions which specify the properties of the restrictor
and thereby use this formalism to model highly context-dependent semantic objects.","[272, 273]"

supported by the semantic equivalence that often exists between adpositions and ap-
plicatives and also by the fact that from the point of view of grammaticalization, adpo-
sitions are one of the primary sources for applicative morphemes (Peterson 2006:125-
129). Since there is a synchronic and diachronic connection between prepositions and
applicatives, it should not be surprising to ﬁnd that they are analysed in almost the
same way as one another. The major diﬀerence between the two constructions is that
the complement of an adposition is collocated with it in the string forming what would

an applicative, the applied object, may be separated from it.
   There are then two possible ways of analysing applicatives. The analytic approach
has a slight semantic advantage: it expresses the semantic role of the applied object by
projecting an additional predicate to related the applied object to the main proposition.
In Katcha there is only one possible role, benefactive, but other languages may have
more than one applicative morpheme assigning diﬀerent roles. The analytic analysis
as laid out here also captures the similarity in function between applicatives and
prepositions. The lexical approach has a slight empirical advantage: in Katcha there
are phonological indications that applicative verbs are more likely to be lexicalised than
verbs with other extensions.
   It has been mentioned more than once that the Katcha applicative is somewhat
atypical. One of the ways this is true is the presence of the a marker before the
benefactive argument. If we adopt the analytic analysis of applicatives, where the
lexical actions of the applicative are essentially equivalent to those of an adposition,
the implication is that a is not a preposition. Rather its role is presumably simply
to mark which noun phrase is the applied object; in other words, it is a case marker.
Alternatively, if we adopt the lexical analysis, the benefactive argument is an argument
of the verb and so once again a must be a case marker. As noted above, the indirect
object of a ditransitive verb is also marked with a, which also supports the idea that a
is a case marker that does not supply any substantive semantic content. A discussion
of case is the focus of the next section.","[229, 230]"

9.7 Conclusion
The basic proposal advanced in this chapter is that prepositional phrases should be
treated as adjuncts. A prepositional phrase speciﬁes an additional property of some
expression of the matrix proposition. In other words, it provides a predicate which
takes such an expression as one of its arguments. That expression may be a term (an
individual or event) in the case of an adjectival PP, or a predicate in the case of an
adverbial PP. In Dynamic Syntax terms, prepositions induce structure which is LINKed
to the matrix propositional tree and which shares semantic content with some node in
the matrix tree.
   The approach to prepositional phrases proposed here treats adjectival prepositions
somewhat diﬀerently to adverbial prepositions. Adjectival PPs are of type e → t while
adverbial prepositions are of type (e → t) → (e → t). This distinction, of course,
is reﬂective of the semantics. An adjectival PP has an intersective interpretation; it
predicates over some term of the matrix proposition to express an additional proposition
concerning that term. An adverbial PP has a subsective interpretation; it predicates
over some predicate of the matrix proposition to express an additional property of that
predicate. Nonetheless, both are prepositional phrases and it should be expected that
they will behave in largely parallel ways. And in fact they do. Despite the diﬀerent
semantic types, all prepositions project a predicate that expresses some relation between
their complement and the expression that they modify. This relation is not part of
the core structure of the matrix proposition, but rather semantically enriches some
expression within it. This can be modelled quite naturally as a separate structure
connected to the modiﬁed expression by means of a LINK.
   The construal of prepositional phrases as LINKed structures, and prepositions as
9.7. Conclusion                                                                      217predicates, explicitly categorises them as modiﬁers. There are therefore substantial
parallels to be seen between prepositional phrases and other modiﬁers. The distinction
between intersective and subsective PPs, for example, parallels the same distinction
seen in the semantics of adjectives. Indeed, Cann (In prep.) suggests an analysis for
English adjectives which directly parallels the one given here: intersective adjectives
induce LINKed structure from the internal variable of an epsilon term (ie. a T y(e)
node), while subsective adjectives induce LINKed structure from the restrictor of an
epsilon term (i.e. a T y(e → t) node). Similarly, the treatment of prepositional phrases
oﬀered here draws explicit parallels between (adjectival) prepositional phrases and
relative clauses. Both prepositional phrases and relative clauses project propositions
which share an argument with the matrix proposition. It is therefore not surprising
that they should use the same basic technical apparatus. The diﬀerence between them
is that relatives include an anaphoric device (either a relative pronoun or a resumptive
pronoun), which introduces the shared argument into their sub-proposition. Like bare
relatives in English, prepositional phrases contain no such anaphoric device so the
shared argument must be introduced by the LINK-COPY Introduction rule.
   Sections 9.5 and 9.6 demonstrated that this analysis is also relevant to constructions
other than prepositional phrases, and both applications have potential theoretical
implications. In section 9.5 it was argued that applicatives can be treated in just
the same way as prepositions, a stance which gains support from the fact that in many
languages the two constructions are related by both a semantic equivalence and by
a history of grammaticalization. The diﬀerence between the two constructions is one
of constituency: the complement of a preposition immediately follows it, whereas the
applied object (which is construed as the complement of the applicative morpheme)
does not necessarily follow immediately after the applicative marker. To state that
applicatives and adpositions are essentially equivalent is therefore something of a
challenge to the importance of the notion of constituency, which is central to most
theories of syntax.
   It was noted in several places, both in chapter 6 and in the present chapter, that
case markers and adpositions represent two ends of a continuum and that there is
no great diﬀerence between them. However, in discussing the diﬀerences between the
Dynamic Syntax construal of case and the account of adpositions given here, section 9.6
laid out what appears to be a quite clear distinction between them. Case is considered
to be a ﬁlter on well-formed structure, specifying where a particular node may be
situated in a tree, but providing no semantic content. On the other hand, adpositions
induce a LINKed sub-tree, building semantic structure and contributing the Formula
value of its predicate. The account oﬀered here can therefore be argued to draw a
substantive theoretical distinction between case and adpositions; the two are quite
diﬀerent within the DS framework. This apparently goes against the general view that
218                          Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casecase and adpositions are actually very similar. However, ‘similar’ is not the same
as ‘identical’. Payne oﬀers a ‘rule of thumb’ for distinguishing case markers from
adpositions which he suggests ‘probably works 90 percent of the time.’ This is the
notion that case marking is imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase
occurs, while adpositions may occur freely. By this deﬁnition, case may be ‘determined
by the grammatical requirements of the verb (or other case-governing element)… Ad-
positional phrases are usually (though not always) “optional” sentence constituents’
(Payne 1997:100-101). The discussion of case and adpositions in section 9.6 might be
thought of as something close to a DS-theoretic characterisation of this ‘rule of thumb’.
With case, the propositional structure and semantic content is projected by the ‘verb
(or other case-governing element)’; case markers simply decorate this structure with
requirements to ensure the correct interpretation of the noun phrase. Adpositions on
the other hand are ‘ “optional” sentence constituents’ because they construct a tree
structure and decorate it with semantic content; moreover, the structure they project
is an adjunct, a LINKed sub-tree. The two deﬁnitions of the diﬀerence between case
and adpositions have a slightly diﬀerent focus though and so they are not quite the
same. Payne’s ‘rule of thumb’ focuses on the obligatoriness of case compared with
the optionality of adpositional constructions; the Dynamic Syntax account oﬀered here
suggests that the diﬀerence is semantic: case morphemes are semantically null and build
no structure, while adpositions contribute semantic content and also induce semantic
structure. The observation that adpositions tend to be more optional is a reﬂection
of the fact that, as modifying adjuncts, the structure they build is outside the main
propositional tree.
   The application of Dynamic Syntax to Katcha prepositional phrases uses only
standard DS rules which have been motivated in other contexts for other constructions
in other languages. Nonetheless, applying these rules to the Katcha data considered
here has implications for our understanding of applicatives and case, as well as for our
understanding of prepositional phrases. The key insight oﬀered here is that preposi-
tional phrases are predicates expressing additional information about some element of
the core proposition of an utterance.
Chapter 10Nominal ModiﬁersIntroduction
This chapter provides a Dynamic Syntax analysis of nominal modiﬁers in Katcha. It
follows on from the arguments advanced in chapter 5 that nominal modiﬁers can be
characterised as demonstrative pronouns or phrases headed by demonstrative pronouns
which stand in apposition to the nouns that they modify. Section 10.1 sets out some
context. It gives an analysis of nouns, noting that lexical nouns cannot be modiﬁed
internally so they must project a fully speciﬁed epsilon structure, and discusses the pro-
cess of LINK Apposition and its evaluation used to allow modiﬁcation. Demonstratives
are also covered, with a discussion of how a demonstrative pronoun can add speciﬁc
referential content to a lexical noun phrase.
   Section 10.2 gives an analysis of subject relative clauses. Crucial to this is an
extension to the notion of the metavariable projected by the demonstrative pronoun
such that it projects a partial epsilon term with a variable and binder, but no restrictor.
The relative clause can then provide the restrictor.
   A similar analysis is given in section 10.3 where it is suggested that a contextually
provided possession predicate provides the restrictor to the epsilon term projected by
the pronoun. Interestingly, it is shown that this has to be a ‘possessed by’ rather than
a ‘possess’ relation, which ﬁts the fact that possessive phrases in Katcha agree with the
head noun and not the possessor.
   Finally, in section 10.4, some brief suggestions are given as to how non-subject
relatives may be analysed. It is noted that the analysis of demonstrative pronouns
given here correctly predicts that non-subjects are unable to be relativised directly.","[235, 236, 237, 238]"

            F o(x), T y(e)Crucially, whilst these actions leave the restrictor node unspeciﬁed, they include the
decoration of the internal T y(e) node with a nominal variable.                In the case of a
relative clause, this allows any verb to construct and decorate the restrictor node freely.
However, the value of the logical subject is already ﬁxed, it is necessarily identiﬁed with
the head noun. Thus a verb can only decorate the restrictor node directly when its
subject is identiﬁed with the modiﬁed noun; only subjects can be relativised directly.
In this, Katcha obeys the generalisations of Keenan and Comrie’s (1977) Accessibility
Hierarchy, which states that subjects are more easily accessible to relativisation than
other NP positions, that positions on the hierarchy lower than subject may require to
be relativised using constructions other than the language’s ‘primary Relative Clause-
forming strategy’, and that the alternative strategies are more likely to include the
use of resumptive pronouns. Interestingly, while Keenan and Comrie (1977) suggest a

predicts (at least some aspects of) this observation from a formal, syntactic perspective.
   As noted above, the ﬁnal analysis of non-subject relatives is likely to rest on the
analysis of the dependent clause marker, ka. Furthermore, any such analysis will
have to take into consideration the fact that the verb of the relative clause cannot
decorate the predicate/restrictor node directly. One possible approach is hinted at
by the connection between relative clauses and possessive noun phrases, mentioned in
section 10.3. It was noted there that possessives may be considered a type of relative,
but the inverse may also be considered to be true. Indeed, the morphological similarity
between the Katcha possessive construction and the non-subject relative construction
is quite noticable, to the extent that Stevenson (1956-57:64) states that for the non-
subject relative, ‘a genitive construction (with genitive particle or possessive pronoun)
is used’. It was suggested in chapter 5 that given the non-ﬁnite nature of non-subject
relatives, and given their appositional nature, an appropriate paraphrase of the noun
phrase in sentences such as (10.29) is to use constructions along the lines of ‘the hen
of Kuku’s seeing her.’ This is a reasonable position to adopt reﬂecting as it does the
morphological link between the ‘possessive particle’ and the ‘relativiser’, as well as
reﬂecting the non-ﬁnite nature of the verb.
   One possible strategy for the analysis of non-subject relatives, then, might be to
see the non-ﬁnite clause as a nominalisation. The entire clause would then provide an
argument for the predicate represented in section 10.3 as P OSSD. If the predicate is
merely a ‘relation whose value is constructed from some contextually provided value’
(Kempson et al. 2001:145), it may be too restrictive to think of it as possession. In that
case, there is no reason why the relation should not hold between the referent of the
head noun and some more abstract entity, such as an event of seeing. Such an approach
would lead to a ﬁnal epsilon-structure along the lines of that sketched in (10.31), where
the internal structure of ϵx , Hen′ (x) is suppressed, SEEING′ is shorthand for some event
of Kuku seeing some object, and P OSSD is the relation that holds between this event
and x.

would entail parsing the head noun, constructing a LINK from it to a ?T y(e) node
and parsing the demonstrative pronoun in the usual way. Since the next lexical item
to be parsed is the proper noun Kuku the possessive set of lexical actions (the second
disjunct from the lexical entry in (10.26)) will be executed, constructing the ‘possessive’
predicate as well as the iota-structure as its object. Thus far the process is exactly as
for possessives, leading to the partial tree in (10.32).","[265, 266, 267]"

8.3 Passive
The subject of a Passive sentence is the patient/theme. So in (8.29), the passive
morphology indicates that kʊrɪ will be interpreted as the logical object.(8.29) kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-tené
           food cook-pass
           ‘some food is being cooked’The lexical actions projected by the passive morphology therefore serve to ensure that
the pointer is left on the logical object node. The subject can then be processed in the
usual way, which means it will decorate the internal argument node.
      There are two strategies that could be used to encode this.
      The ﬁrst is to treat passive verbs as lexical items and parse the verb and suﬃx
together as a unit (8.30). This would treat passive verbs as having a diﬀerent set of

                      ELSE       abortThe second approach is to assume that the verb is parsed as normal and then the
passive suﬃx is parsed separately. The suﬃx then simply has the eﬀect of moving the
pointer from the external argument node to the internal argument node (8.31):(8.31) Lexical entry for passive suﬃx -tené
              IF        T y(e), ?∃x.F o(x), ⟨↑0 ⟩?T y(es → t)
       -tené THEN go(⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↓1 ⟩⟨↓0 ⟩)
                   ELSE       abortAt this stage there is no clear reason not to assume the latter, compositional approach.
In this case the lexical actions associated with the passive suﬃx (8.31) check that
the pointer is on the logical subject node (⟨↑0 ⟩?T y(es → t)) and that it still requires
a formula value (?∃x.F o(x)). The latter condition prevents a successful parse of the
passive suﬃx where the logical subject node has already been decorated by the preverbal
syntactic subject. In other words, a verb marked with a passive suﬃx is incompatible
with the syntactic subject being interpreted as agent. If these conditions are met, the
lexical actions simply move the pointer on to the logical object node, and then the
parse proceeds as for transitive verbs. Thus in parsing (8.29), the subject and verb
are parsed, giving the tree in (8.32).9 The passive suﬃx is then parsed and its actions
move the pointer to the logical object node, where the metavariable may be resolved
by uniﬁcation with the unﬁxed node, as in (8.33).

     The internal structure of the term projected by the syntactic subject, ϵx , Food′ (x)), is not relevant,
so it is suppressed for clarity. As usual lambda operators and their variables are also suppressed.

   Having fulﬁlled all requirements on the internal argument node the tree can be
compiled in the usual manner. The external argument node is unaﬀected by the passive:
it remains decorated by a metavariable and a formula requirement. An appropriate
referent for the agent therefore has to be found, substituted from context if there is no
suitable linguistic referent. This characterisation of the passive therefore ensures that
there is always a referential argument reading for the agent, i.e. that there is always
a semantic agent, even if this is only implied. Once the agent node is decorated with
an appropriate agent the ﬁnal logical form is as in (8.34), which is of course truth-
conditionally equivalent to its active counterpart.

        ‘drums are hit for wrestling (habitually)’   The lexical actions associated with the unaccusative directly correlate with those
of the antipassive. The diﬀerence of course, is that unaccusative constructions are
‘agentless’ rather than ‘patientless’, that is, the unaccusative decorates the logical
subject node rather than the logical object node with a value indicating an individual
which is indeﬁnite, arbitrary and context-dependent.
   In processing a sentence such as (8.35), after parsing the subject and verb, we have
the partial tree in (8.36), with a type e term projected by the subject decorating an
unﬁxed node, and the pointer sitting on the logical subject node:

   The unaccusative suﬃx is then parsed. In the same way that the antipassive does
for the logical object, the lexical actions associated with the unaccusative morpheme
build an epsilon structure from the logical subject node. This epsilon structure has
propositional content whose sub-components are copied from the predicate, logical
object and situation argument nodes of the tree. These lexical actions are given in

by the syntactic subject can instantiate the metavariable. As was the case with the
antipassive, the node it uniﬁes with happens to be the logical object node of the epsilon
term rather than of the matrix proposition, but this is of no consequence because the
two nodes are linked by the copy mechanism, so will end up being decorated with the
same Formula value. It just happens to be that the incremental nature of Dynamic
Syntax entails the lower node be instantiated ﬁrst. The tree can now be compiled as
normal, the pointer working its way up the tree compiling the epsilon term to decorate
the logical subject node of the propositional tree. The requirement for a formula value
on the propositional object node means that the pointer has to move down to that
node to update the metavariable there, which it will do using the value that has been
established for V during the process of constructing the epsilon term. The ﬁnal tree
for (8.35) is then as shown in (8.39) (with ϵy , Drum′ (y) abbreviated to D′ ), the root

5.3 Relative Clauses
Relative clauses in Katcha are formed using two relative particles, one at the beginning
of the relative clause and one at the end. The clause-initial relative marker is já/má/ná;
the clause-ﬁnal relative marker is já/mɔ́/nɔ́.
     Only subjects can be directly relativised in Katcha. There is no subject agreement
marker on the verb in a relative clause, being replaced by the relative marker. Verb
stems always begin with a vowel, and the vowel of the (ﬁrst) relative marker in subject
relatives elides. At the end of the relative clause is the marker já/mɔ́/nɔ́. Both relative
markers display agreement with the gender of the head noun (5.18):(5.18) a. miːte [j-akʊ́           ɔ́ːjɔ́     já   ] amaːla

             she.goat-pl rel.p-eat grass rel.p 3p-pl-be.brown
             ‘The goats which are eating grass are brown’    Non-subject relatives are formed in a similar, but slightly diﬀerent, way. As with
subject relatives, the subordinate clause is enclosed by relative markers which show
agreement with the head noun. However, the internal structure of the relative clause
is diﬀerent: a non-ﬁnite verb is used, being marked by the dependent clause marker ka
(and sometimes the inﬁnitive marker t-). A resumptive pronoun is also common; this
does not occur in the case of subject relatives. (5.19a-c) give examples of direct objects
being relativised for masculine, feminine and plural gender nouns respectively. (5.20)
demonstrates the relativisation of an indirect object and (5.21) gives an example of an
oblique argument being relativised. Note that in these examples the word following the
(intial) relative marker, the subject of the relative clause, begins with a consonant and
the relative marker is consequently realised as [já/má/ná], rather than the [j-/m-/n-]
seen in the subject relative examples.(5.19) a. miːte [já            kʊ́kkû ka       ɪcɪ ́ ɪ ́ ɪ ́ já       ] akʊ́           ɔ́ːjɔ́

this is once again marked by the addition of t- before the clause-initial relative marker.

5.3.2 Relative markers as Pronouns
Relative clauses may occur without an overt head noun, in which case the relative
marker can be considered to have a pronominal reading.(5.27) a       ya         adïnï atene ka         ïmmï kateene ya
        a      ja         atini -tene ka         imːi   kateːne ja

5.3.3 Adjectives
In Katcha adjectives do not form a separate grammatical category, but are a type of
verb. There is some evidence of a slight morphological distinction between adjectival
verbs and more prototypical verbs (an additional morpheme marking semantic plural
in the case of adjectives), but with regard to agreement, adjectives show normal verbal
morphology and behave in the same way as any other intransitve verb.
   When used predicatively as in (5.28-5.30b), adjectives take the usual verbal subject
agreement preﬁxes (cf 5.28-5.30a).(5.28) a. miːte      -akʊ́    ɔ́ːjɔ́

Assuming attributive adjectives to be relative clauses, there are three kinds of nominal
modiﬁers in Katcha: demonstratives, possessive noun phrases and relative clauses.
These are indicated by the presence of the morphemes listed in table 5.2. Aside from
the medial and distal demonstratives, these three types of nominal modiﬁers are clearly
all related. All three are introduced by similar morphemes showing agreement with the
head noun. It is worth considering the nature of this relation in more detail and in
particular, the question of whether the proximal demonstrative, the possessive marker
and the relative marker are all the same morpheme and, if so, how this chould be
characterised.
   Stevenson (1941) takes a conservative descriptive line, taking the common element
to be just the j-/m-/n- gender agreement preﬁxes, which then attach to diﬀerent
morphemes. Thus, in his view, these gender preﬁxes may attach to the demonstrative
stem -a/-ɔ (Stevenson 1941:58), to the ‘genitive particle’ -a (Stevenson 1941:47) and
‘possessive pronouns’ eːte, etc. (Stevenson 1941:48), and to verbs (Stevenson 1941:68).
Although Stevenson does not explicitly state it as such, this approach essentially
analyses the j-/m-/n- preﬁxes as a general marker of nominal modiﬁers. However,
whilst it seems correct to a large extent, such an analysis does not go far enough in
that it does not incorporate the medial and demonstrative pronouns, which agree in
gender with the head noun, yet do not carry these preﬁxes. This fact is signiﬁcant for
the hypothesis that j-/m-/n- are preﬁxes which mark modiﬁcation generally, because
whilst the existence of a ‘general modiﬁcation’ marker does not preclude the existence
of other constructions, it is surprising to ﬁnd that the possessives and relatives pattern
with the proximal demonstrative, while the medial and distal demonstratives do not.
The remainder of this chapter proposes an alternative analysis which uniﬁes the account
of the three types of nominal modiﬁer, ﬁts the overall patterns of Katcha morphosyntax,
and accounts for the medial and distal demonstratives. The proposed analysis is that
all nominal modiﬁers in Katcha are headed by an initial demonstrative pronoun.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]"

7.5 Conclusion
In section 7.1 it was noted following Hyman (2007) that verb extensions in African
languages may have one of four basic functions, listed in (7.39).(7.39) a. increase valence
          b. decrease valence
          c. (re-)orient action
          d. mark aspectOf these four functions, the ﬁrst two primarily aﬀect the arguments of a proposition
while the latter two primarily aﬀect the predicate. That is, (a-b) primarily aﬀect

146                                   Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Verb Extensionsnominals while (c-d) primarily aﬀect verbs. Katcha verb extensions are all of the
former type, licensing the presence or absence of arguments.
   There are various morphemes related to argument structure which are potential
candidates for being classed as verb extensions. Of these, reﬂexives and reciprocals are
not encoded using verb extensions; Katcha uses a more analytic construction with a
noun or pronoun expressing the reﬂexive or reciprocal object.
   The applicative is the only one of the Katcha verb extensions to increase valency.
This makes it something of a special case. However, it is also something of a special
case in that it is not typical of applicative constructions typologically. There is no al-
ternative non-applicative construction with the same truth-conditional meaning. Also,
the additional argument it licenses is marked with the dative preposition a rather than
being a direct object, so in one sense this morpheme does not increase valency. Rather,
it introduces an oblique argument and so acts somewhat like a preposition. A Dynamic
Syntax theoretical analysis modelling applicatives from this point of view is given in
chapter 9.
   If the ‘applicative’ does not in fact increase valency, then we can revise the statement
at the beginning of this section to say that all Katcha verb extensions decrease valency;
the function of all of them is to license the absence of a syntactic argument. This is
not surprising given that it was noted in section 7.2 that Katcha verbs are inherently
transitive. If it is semantically plausible for a verb to be transitive, this is always
the basic form. Most of these VEs decrease semantic valency in addition to syntactic
valency, presenting the event described by the verb as having only one participant
(though this is not the case for the passive). As shown in table 7.1, Katcha has a
complete paradigm of valency decreasing verb extensions. A theoretical analysis within
the framework of Dynamic Syntax is given for these verb extensions in chapter 8. This
range of VEs allows Katcha to use inherently transitive verbs to present an event as
involving either one or two participants, and to take either the semantic agent or the
semantic patient as subject, thereby providing alternative perspectives on the situation
expressed.

Chapter 8Verb ExtensionsIntroduction
In chapter 7, it was noted that the majority of verb extensions in Katcha are detransi-
tivising and that these valency-reducing VEs can be classiﬁed according to two features,
namely the thematic role played by the syntactic subject and the number of arguments
expressed. This classiﬁcation is summarised in table 7.1, repeated here as table 8.1.","[164, 165, 166, 167, 168]"

                   ♢       The contexts illustrated in (9.43b) and (9.43c) can be brought together under the
single notion that dative nouns decorate a term node which is neither the logical
subject nor the logical object of the proposition.                 In other words the dative case
simply marks nouns which are neither the subject nor the object of their clause. In
terms of modal tree logic, the logical subject node may be deﬁned as ⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)
and the logical object node may be deﬁned as ⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t). The lexical actions
of the a case marker therefore involve decorating the node under development with
requirements that neither of these two descriptions hold at that node. However, this
characterisation precludes (9.43a), where the dative noun decorates the open ?T y(e)
node in an applicative construction. To incorporate this possibility, dative a requires
a disjoint lexical entry with a disjunct making reference to the fact that an applicative
has been parsed (9.44).10(9.44) Lexical entry for dative a
          IF       ?T y(e)
                THEN       IF        ⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↓1 ⟩F o(ben′ ), T y(e → (es → t)
           a               THEN      put(?T y(e))
                           ELSE      put(?¬⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t), ?¬⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t))
                ELSE       Abort       When the pointer is on an open term node, the actions in (9.44) check whether
it is an applied argument (that is, whether the current node is an argument of the
ben ′ predicate projected by the applicative morpheme). If so, no action need be taken
and parsing may proceed. To allow this formally a ‘dummy action’ is carried out
duplicating the type requirement which already decorates the node and thus adding no
further information to the tree. If the node under development is not the argument
of such a predicate, the actions decorate the node with modal requirements expressing
the fact that the current node cannot be either the logical subject (?¬⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)) or
the logical object (?¬⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)).
       The lexical entry in (9.44) illustrates two diﬀerent ways in which context dependence
may be formalised. The actions of the second disjunct reﬂect the usual DS construal
of case, deﬁning the context in which the formula value of the node must ultimately
be interpreted (in this case the fact that it cannot be subject or object). These actions
  10
     This is not an issue if applicative verbs are in fact lexicalised. In that case the structure in (9.43b)
is the relevant one for applicative verbs as well as ditransitive verbs, and the lexical entry (9.44) does
not need the disjunction.
9.6. Case markers                                                                                   215constrain the further development of the tree and therefore decorate the node with
requirements. The strong negation operator (¬) is persistent (Kempson et al. 2001:289-
290): the statements it scopes over (⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t) and ⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)) hold for the
current partial tree but also for all subsequent tree developments. Thus the use of
requirements ensures that these conditions will be met at all subsequent stages of the
parse, most importantly at the ﬁnal evaluation of the tree.11
       Contrastingly, the ﬁrst disjunct does not place any restrictions on future tree growth,
it depends only on the presence of a particular morpheme (the applicative) in the
immediately preceding context. It is therefore modelled as a condition within the lexical
entry, allowing the parse to proceed only if the applicative morpheme has already been
parsed. This action of checking the Formula value of the the predicate may seem
stipulative, but this is simply a way of formalising lexical selection. The traditional
way of describing lexical selection would be to say that an applicative verb selects a
dative complement, but it is equally feasible to express the inverse - a dative noun
is licensed by the presence of an applicative verb - and this is what the lexical entry
expresses.12
       A similar process of lexical selection takes place when personal pronouns occur as
the complement of prepositions. As noted in chapter 6 there are two sets of personal
pronouns, which may be described as ‘Core’ and ‘Oblique’. When used as a prepositional
complement, the form of the pronoun is determined by the preposition. This selection
is strongly lexical: many prepositions do not select only one type of pronoun, but ‘mix
and match’ from the two sets. This makes it hard to deﬁne any pronominal feature
which the lexical entry might subcategorize for. The best way to model this lexical
stipulation is therefore to encode it within the lexical entry of the pronoun. This will
mean the lexical entry for the pronoun has to be multiply disjunctive, but since there
are a limited number of prepositions the disjunction will not be implausibly large.
For example, (9.45) gives a possible lexical entry for the 3rd person masculine oblique
personal pronoun ɪnɪ ́:(9.45) Lexical entry for ɪnɪ ́
  11
     Though in fact, in the case of (9.43b-c) the node has a ﬁxed address and so the requirements are
satisﬁed immediately.
  12
     In section 6.5 it was stated that most verbs do not select the forms of their arguments and this was
given as a reason for thinking of oblique role markers as prepositions rather than case markers. Here
we see an exception in that applicative verbs do select the form of their complement. This is further
support for the argument (which came initially from the theoretical analysis) that a should be thought
of as a dative case marker rather than a preposition.

parsed and (the revised version of) Substitution (10.19) applies to instantiate the
metavariable with an appropriate referent and complete the LINKed epsilon-tree. In
the case of a relative clause however, Substitution does not apply and the LINKed
tree is completed by processing additional lexical items.
   6
     This ﬁnal point, that the updating process includes the construction of the restrictor node, is
notable. The process described here is not merely one of Substitution of a Formula value as deﬁned
in Cann et al. (2005:72), but involves the abduction of structure. Formalising this process will require
to be done carefully, to ensure there is an appropriate trigger for the construction of structure, and
that monotonicity is retained; it is not clear that a free pragmatic process like substitution should
be allowed to build structure in an unconstrained manner. I leave this formality to one side for the
present.
10.2. Subject Relatives                                                               233   In (10.15′ ), the pointer is at the root node of the LINKed partial tree. However,
there is an oustanding ?T y(t) requirement at its argument daughter which must be
fulﬁlled. As noted above, one way of fulﬁlling this requirement is by Substitution
of the metavariable with an epsilon-term and abduction of the necessary structure
from that. However, all rules in DS are optional and in the case of the relative clause
Substitution does not apply; the pointer is therefore compelled to move to the node
with the unfulﬁlled requirement. With the pointer now at the ?T y(t) node, the verb of
the relative clause can be parsed in the usual way, followed by the object noun. It is
instructive to note that in a subject relative clause, the verb does not carry the subject
agreement marker which is obligatory in other ﬁnite environments. This is reﬂected
in the analysis given here, where the subject node has already been decorated by the
demonstrative pronoun. A full DS analysis of Katcha verbs falls outwith the scope of
the current study, but it is plausible to suppose that the obligatory subject agreement
marker in a ﬁnite clause may be an ‘incorporated pronoun’ which decorates the logical
subject node and that the verb projects the predicate and (where appropriate) object
nodes. In the case of a relative clause an alternative pronoun, the demonstrative,
decorates the subject node. Parsing the verb and object of the relative clause then
gives the tree in (10.20).

on the intermediate nodes and providing a complete epsilon term to instantiate the
meta-variable and fulﬁl the requirement for a Formula value on the root node. This
brings about the tree in (10.16), which can be evaluated using the rule of Appositive
LINK Evaluation (10.9) to produce a single epsilon term with a conjoint restrictor
(ϵx , (Cow′ (x) ∧ Eat′ (ϵy , Grass′ (y))(x))) as the logical object of the matrix proposition.
   The analysis outlined here ultimately gives a result which models the Katcha
data very well. There are three salient features of demonstratives in Katcha which
were presented in chapter 5: ﬁrstly, demonstratives are pronouns; secondly, they
are appositional to the modiﬁed noun; thirdly, they ascribe deﬁniteness to the noun
phrase, there being no separate lexical category of determiners. The lexical actions
for the demonstrative proposed here project three nodes which are reﬂective of these
three respective features: a metavariable, a nominal variable identical to that of the
modiﬁed noun, and an epsilon binding operator. When these lexical actions interact
10.2. Subject Relatives                                                                      235with standard Dynamic Syntax rules such as LINK Apposition and standard epsilon
calculus semantics, the expected interpretation of subject relative clauses falls out quite
naturally.
      It should be noted that this account of subject relatives leads obligatorily to the
relativised noun phrase having an indeﬁnite interpretation. This might seem sur-
prising since the relativising particle is the demonstrative pronoun, which is usually
associated with a deﬁnite interpretation; somewhere along the way it appears that
the demonstrative has lost its ability to ascribe deﬁnitenesss to the noun it modiﬁes.
The explanation of this puzzle is in the incremental nature of Dynamic Syntax. DS
characterises pronouns as underspeciﬁed metavariables which are subsequently updated.
The deﬁniteness of a pronoun does not come from the pronoun itself, but from the term
which later instantiates the metavariable. The fact that there is a unique, identiﬁable
referent for a noun phrase is a matter of pragmatics, not lexicon. As a case in point,
so-called deﬁnite determiners like the in English are frequently used in non-deﬁnite
contexts, such as generic expressions.
      In the case of a Katcha demonstrative noun phrase like fɪjɔ mɔ́, ‘this cow’, in (10.1),
the demonstrative pronoun does ascribe deﬁniteness to the phrase. This is because
the metavariable is resolved by Substitution and the context will supply a deﬁnite,
identiﬁable referent. The demonstrative pronoun, by its anaphoric nature, provides
an opening for a deﬁnite referent for the noun phrase; the ϵ-operator projected by the
demonstrative is supplemented by the ι-operator provided by the substituend. The
demonstrative pronoun thereby causes the noun phrase to be deﬁnite. In the case
of a relative clause, the metavariable is not resolved by Substitution, but instead
is resolved when the tree is compiled following the parsing of the verb (and any
complements). There is no opportunity for any further update to the binding operator
and consequently that node remains decorated with an ϵ-binder and the noun phrase
remains indeﬁnite.
      The prediction that relativised nouns in Katcha can only be indeﬁnite has a nice
consequence, in that it explains the second instance of the demonstrative pronoun
at the end of the relative clause. In my data, this clause-ﬁnal pronoun is present
quite consistently but previous researchers have not found this to be the case. Gilley
(2013:502) suggests that it is obligatory for masculine, optional for feminine and absent
for plural nouns, though she does not attempt to give any further analysis. Stevenson
(1956-57:61,63), however, ﬁnds that the clause-ﬁnal demonstrative is optional and states
that its purpose is to mark deﬁniteness. The analysis given here predicts Stevenson’s
data to be correct.7
      Assuming that the clause-ﬁnal demonstrative is there to make the noun phrase
  7
    I generally ﬁnd Stevenson’s descriptions to be quite accurate, so this should come as no major
surprise.

Starting from the point in the parse when all words except for the ﬁnal demonstrative

tive are carried out. Naturally, these are the same steps described above: Appositive

9.4 Locative adverbs(9.23) ak-oɗo           ak-atáɗá               k-été     kɪ ́ʈá

adverbs rather than as prepositional phrases headed by ka. It is now possible to expand
upon this distinction. A prepositional phrase like kete in (9.1) modiﬁes a term (even
when that term is an event) and might therefore be described as adjectival. On the
other hand, a prepositional phrase like a kʊɓɓʊ in (9.15) modiﬁes a predicate and might
therefore be described as adverbial. Analysing words such as kɪʈa as locative adverbs
suggests that they should be analysed in the same way as adverbial prepositional
phrases, that is, as type (e → t) → (e → t) predicates. It was also noted in chapter
6 that these adverbs add detail to the location provided by the locative prepositional
198                             Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casephrase; in other words, they modify the prepositional phrase. Since the prepositional
phrase projects a proposition whose predicate is a locative relation, it is straightforward
to analyse the adverb as modifying this predicate.
   Under this analysis, the processing of sentence (9.23) will proceed in the following
manner (ignoring the initial verb akoɗo for conciseness). As with all intransitive verbs,
ataɗa , ‘stand’, projects a full propositional template, of type e → (es → t) including a
metavariable decorating the logical subject node and a term decorating the event node.
In the case of (9.23), the verb is in an imperative form. The imperative does two things:
ﬁrstly, it speciﬁes the addressee as the logical subject of the proposition; secondly, it
adds extra information marking the fact that the speaker desires the addressee to bring
about the event expressed by the proposition. Exactly how this is achieved formally is
not relevant to the current discussion, so I for now it is simply indicated by a +IMP
imperative marker on the propositional root node and the proposition is otherwise
treated as if it were declarative. I also assume that having parsed akataɗa, the logical
subject is correctly identiﬁed with the addressee (in this case, the group of boys):(9.24) Parsing akataꞌda                                      ?T y(t), +IMP                     F o(si ), T y(es ), ♢           ?T y(es → t)

   With the pointer on the event argument, the prepositional phrase kete, ‘loc-me’
can be parsed, decorating a LINKed propositional tree just as in sections 9.1-9.2 above.
The proposition projected by the prepositional phrase speciﬁes that the event to which
it is LINKed (si ) stands in a LOC ′ relation with the speaker (9.25).

In other words, all preﬁxes on semantically plural replacive nouns also occur as preﬁxes
on plurative nouns. The only exception is aɲ-, which as noted above is very rare and
probably in the process of disappearing.
     Something very similar can be said for the semantically singular forms. The majority
of the singulative preﬁxes in (4.11) also occur in the lists in section 4.1.2 (lists 4.5–4.7).
In other words, almost all preﬁxes on semantically singular replacive nouns also occur
as preﬁxes on singulative nouns. The singulative preﬁx s- is an exception, but it is very
rare and possibly in the process of disappearing.
     The only singulative preﬁx in (4.11) which was not mentioned in section 4.1.2 is
m-. This stands as the only aﬃx which occurs relatively commonly in replacive nouns
but does not also occur as a singulative or plurative preﬁx in isolation. As noted for
the ‘human’ noun-class above (and as discussed in more detail in sections 4.2 and 4.3),
/m/ is a marker of feminine gender, so it is possible that singulative m- is derived from
the reanalysis of a gender marker. Such a reanalysis would be most likely to occur on
nouns which did not already have a singulative marker, i.e. plurative nouns, turning
them into replacive nouns.
    The nouns in (4.11) do oﬀer some indications that there may be more generalisations
to be drawn with regard to particular pairs of preﬁxes and semantic groupings. For
example, (a–c) all take singulative m- and plurative k- and all refer to certain types of
body parts (Gilley (2013:514) suggests ‘appendages’), while (f–h) all take singulative
nt- and plurative mV- and all refer to types of trees. Nevertheless, it is not clear that
the replacive preﬁxes should be thought of as occuring in pairs generally, as would
4.1. Number                                                                           47be expected in a Niger-Congo noun class system. There seems to be a good deal of
‘mix-and-matching’ (though some combinations are more common than others). For
example, singulative m- occurs with plurative nVk- and also with plurative k-, while
plurative k- occurs with singulative t-, nt- and m-. It is probably best to think of
number preﬁxes in Katcha as a set of singulative preﬁxes and a set of plurative suﬃxes,
with some nouns being inﬂected by both.
   To Tucker and Bryan (1966:11), ‘the multiplicity of Singular and Plural Aﬃxes
gives the impression of a Class system long since broken down.’ The case of s-/aɲ-, a
ﬁxed pair of number-marking preﬁxes apparently in the process of being being replaced
by more productive singulative and plurative preﬁxes, might be an example of this.
It should be noted though that Schadeberg (1981:304) contends that the absence of a
noun class system in Kadu ‘cannot easily be explained as a loss’.
   Relatively few nouns display replacive morphology, so it is diﬃcult to make strong
generalisations. Nonetheless, the fact that the vast majority of the replacive preﬁxes
occur as plurative or singulative preﬁxes in non-replacive contexts and the fact that
the replacive preﬁxes do not seem to be limited to speciﬁc pair combinations both
suggest that replacive-marking nouns should not be thought of as a separate category
of noun. Replacive nouns are simply nouns which happen to mark both number values
morphologically rather than only one.","[64, 65, 66]"
"
6.6 Pronominal case
It has been argued throughout this chapter that the morphemes which specify oblique
argument roles in Katcha are better described as prepositions than as case markers.
This is on the basis that these oblique arguments do not generally have their form
assigned obligatorily by the verb. This is not the same for pronouns, the form of which
clearly is determined by some governing element, either the verb or a preposition. There
is therefore a strong argument for describing the forms of the pronouns as cases. This
is particularly true for the core pronouns where tone seems to play a role.
   As noted in section 6.1.1, it may be that the case of the core pronouns is marked
by their tone melody. The use of tone to mark case is extremely rare in a global
perspective and arguably does not exist at all outwith Africa, but is common in eastern
Africa: ‘tone as a marker for case is the most salient feature of case behaviour in
Africa’ (König 2008:224). There are a couple of comments to be made regarding the
fact that Katcha may exhibit tonal case. One is a typological implication: the case
alignment is likely to be ‘marked-nominative’. Marked-nominative systems display the
same alignment as accusative case systems; that is, the subjects of both transitive
and intransitive clauses (the S and A arguments) are marked in the same way, while
the object of a transitive clause (the P argument) is treated diﬀerently. However, in
a prototypical marked-nominative language, the accusative form is functionally and
morphologically unmarked, acting as the default form, whilst the nominative form is
morphologically marked with its use restricted to the realisation of S and A arguments.
In that sense, marked-nominative systems are slightly reminiscent of ergative systems.
Like tonal case, marked-nominative systems are rare from a global perspective, but
‘constitute the most widespread type of case systems in Africa’ (König 2008:138). More
signiﬁcantly,     ‘there is a connection between case expressed by tone and the existence of
     a marked-nominative system… If case is expressed by tone then there is a
     marked-nominative system.’ (König 2008:198,224)Therefore it is to be expected that if Katcha has tonal case it will have a marked-
124                           Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and Prepositionsnominative alignment.9
       A further interesting observation is that within tonal case systems it is particularly
common for low tone to be the marker of Nominative case, which appears to be the
case in Katcha. This tendency appears to be a universal feature of both the Cushitic
(Afro-Asiatic) and Nilotic (Nilo-Saharan) families. There are other language families
with tonal case which use other tone patterns to mark Nominative, but in Cushitic
and Nilotic, ‘the nominative is always expressed by loss of a high tone, triggering a
low tone’ (König (2008:223), citing Tosco (1994)). In the context of the ongoing debate
about the genetic aﬃliation of the Kadu family, this is notable because Katcha nominals
share characteristics with both of these families. The tripartite number marking system
described in chapter 4 as being common in Nilo-Saharan is particularly prevalent in
Nilotic, and this is also one of the few branches of Nilo-Saharan with a masculine-
feminine gender system. Also in chapter 4, it was demonstrated that Katcha’s highly
unusual gender system is found in several Cushitic languages. So whether it is a genetic
or areal trait or a typological correlation, it seems that Katcha nominals do not only
share features of number and gender with Nilotic and Cushitic languages, but also case.
       It is important at this point to state the caveat that there remains a great deal
that is unclear about the tonal system of Katcha, and a good percentage of my textual
data originally comes from written sources which do not mark tone at all. As such,
conclusions about tonal behaviour should be treated as tentative. It is plausible that
the diﬀerences in tone melody on pronouns which have been ascribed to case may in
fact be conditioned by other factors, such as intonation or position in the sentence.
Nonetheless, given its geographical location, it would not be surprising to ﬁnd case
marked by tone in Katcha.
       If the tone variation on core pronouns is indeed a marker of the Nominative and
Accusative cases, it may be that the oblique form of the pronouns described in section
6.1.2 should also be thought of as a case, presumably ‘Oblique’ case. It is diﬀerent from
the tonal case exhibitied in core pronouns, however, in that it is not assigned by verbs
but by prepositions.
       Pronominal case can be summarised as follows. The verb assigns tonal case, which
I tentatively take to be Nominative and Accusative, to the core arguments. Peripheral
arguments are not generally marked by case, but by prepositions (though see section
9.6 for discussion of the status of dative a). These prepositions also assign case, either
Accusative (section 6.2.1), Oblique (section 6.2.2) or a mixture of both (section 6.2.3).
   9
    König (2008:198) suggests that this correlation is an absolute universal in the case of nouns, but
that with pronouns tonal marking may also be found in a few languages with accusative case alignment.
The question of whether Katcha nouns exhibit tonal case alternations remains open, pending a fuller
investigation of tone. It could be that case is only relevant to pronouns, in which case the possibility
exists that Katcha is one of the small number of exceptions with an accusative system realised by tone.

This chapter set out to describe the various forms of pronoun found in Katcha and to
explain the diﬀerences between them. Given the fact that the choice of pronominal
form is heavily dependent on the role it plays in the sentence and (in oblique cases)
which preposition it follows, an extended discussion of prepositions and similar mor-
phemes was necessary before it was tentatively concluded that these diﬀerent forms
are realisations of case. Core cases (Nominative and Accusative) are assigned by verbs,
while prepositions assign Accusative or Oblique case to their pronominal complements.
       The pronominal system once again reﬂects the importance in Katcha of the contrast
between the notions of ‘core’ and ‘peripheral’.10 There are two sets of pronouns, one of
which is used for the core arguments of subject and object while the other is used for
oblique arguments. For this reason, I have proposed referring to these sets of prononuns
as the core pronouns and the oblique pronouns respectively. Even if it is correct that
there is a distinction between the nominative and accusative cases, this still amounts
to a secondary diﬀerentiation within the category of core pronoun.
       When we look at the interaction between the pronouns and prepositions it becomes
clear that these contrasting notions of core and non-core apply in other areas of the
language, and not just to argument structure. There are three types of prepositions:
those which take core pronouns as complements, those which take oblique pronouns as
complements and those which take a combination. The third group, which includes the
great majority of prepositions, is perhaps the most interesting because of the nature
of the combination of pronouns. The relevant factor in this case is whether or not
the preposition’s complement is a speech act participant. In 1st and 2nd person,
i.e. the core speech act participants, these prepositions take core pronouns as their
complements. In the 3rd person, i.e. non-speech act participants, the oblique pronouns
are used. In this way, there is a morphologically realised connection between the
notion of core arguments with regard to sentencial predicate-argument structure and
the notion of core participants with regard to speech act participation. The fact that
the pronouns used for subject and object (vis a vis oblique arguments) are also used for
speaker and hearer (vis a vis non-participants) gives further support to the idea that
the main diﬀerence between the two sets of pronouns is that of ‘core’ vs ‘peripheral’.","[142, 143, 144]"

78                                  Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Nominal Modiﬁers5.4.1 The unity of nominal modiﬁers — Phonological evidence
There is evidence to suggest that the já/má/ná found with possessors and at the
beginning of relative clauses is a phonologically conditioned allomorph of the já/mɔ́/nɔ́
found in demonstrative noun phrases and at the end of relative clauses.
     There are notable phonetic diﬀerences between já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́.         The
former generally have a shorter, more neutral vowel, which is often subject to vowel
elision and harmony, both of which are very common general processes in Katcha.
The tone of this vowel appears to be high but these morphemes are frequently run
together with the following word (often eliding the vowel) such that it can be hard
to establish tone accurately. The vowel also has a tendency to harmonise to some
degree with the following vowel. So although generally written as <ya ma na>,
pronunciation may vary according to the vowel that follows (eg. [jɪ ́ mɪ ́ nɪ ]́ or [jɔ́ mɔ́
nɔ́]). The vowel harmony is not always as complete as in some other contexts (the vowel
harmony between noun stem and number preﬁx, for example), presumably due to the
word boundary: /má kʊ́kkʊ̂/ does often sound closer to [m ́ gʊ́kʊ̂] than to [mʊ́gʊ́kʊ̂] or
[mɔ́gʊ́kʊ̂]. It can be diﬃcult to distinguish the exact vowel quality though, because the
vowel is often very short or, as noted above, elided altogether in the case of a following
vowel. This is in marked contrast with the já/mɔ́/nɔ́ morphemes which have slightly
longer, more pronounced vowels. They are much less prone to elision before a vowel
and carry an exceptionally high tone.
     Signiﬁcantly, the syntactic distribution of these forms is complementary within the
noun phrase: já/má/ná (possessive marker and clause-initial relative marker) occurs at
the beginning of a nominal modiﬁer; já/mɔ́/nɔ́ (demonstrative and clause-ﬁnal relative
marker) occurs only at the end. There is a strong argument therefore that the phonetic
diﬀerences are to do with phrasal intonation. The já/mɔ́/nɔ́ marker occurs at the end
of the noun phrase; importantly, it generally occurs before a pause. This, combined
with the extra-high tone, serves to give it a notable emphasis. In the case of the
demonstratives, there is naturally something contrastive about their semantics, and it
would seem to be this that is reﬂected in the intonation. Relative clauses are generally
parenthetical; again the intonation seems to reﬂect this with a higher than usual tone on
the clause-ﬁnal relative marker and a pause before continuing with the matrix clause. In
contrast, the já/má/ná marker occurs at the beginning of the modiﬁer and consequently
does not carry the same contrastive or parenthetical intonation. It behaves like most
short non-lexical Katcha words (eg. prepositions): undergoing vowel harmony, elision,
etc.
     Evidence that the diﬀerence between já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ is primarily intona-
tional can be seen in example (5.35), where the demonstrative morpheme nɔ́ occurs at
the end of a left-dislocated object noun phrase a tʊ́mːá nɔ́, ‘these words’:

        ‘I want to tell you these words’                                      (TEACH:1.48)In this case, there is no contrastive intonation or pause and the vowel of the demonstra-
tive is elided before the pronoun: [adʊ́mːánáː]. Thus this is an example of demonstrative
nɔ́ being realised as n- before a vowel, exactly as the possessive/relative markers ná
would be, apparently due to the intonational properties of its position in the sentence.
Note that (5.35) is not an example of a relative marker: the subject pronoun is in
the wrong case (nominative rather than oblique), the verb is ﬁnite and there is no
corresponding clause-ﬁnal relative marker. All of these indicate that this sentence is
made up of a single main clause (in addition to the fact that there is no other candidate
for a matrix verb in this sentence). The analysis of this noun phrase as a left-dislocated
demonstrative phrase also concurs with the translation provided by Katcha speakers
and the spelling suggested by them (<no> rather than <na>).
     Some additional evidence that já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are allomorphs comes from
the spelling conventions used in literature written by Katcha speakers (in particular,
the draft Katcha New Testament). When possessive and clause-inital relative markers
(já/má/ná) occur with the oblique argument marker t- they are consistently written as
<tiya tamo tano>3 even when preceding a vowel. When these markers occur without
the t- and precede a vowel, they are consistently written as a preﬁx <y-/m-/n->.
When they occur without the t- but precede a consonant, they are generally written
as <ya/ma/na>. Thus the same morpheme may be spelled three ways according to
context. Signiﬁcantly, spellings with <-o> and spellings with <-a> are both used
in diﬀerent contexts for what is clearly the same morpheme, despite the fact that
this spelling alternation does not reﬂect the phonetic realisation. Spelling habits
should certainly not be taken as conclusive (it may simply be that certain spellings
are becoming conventionalised in the vernacular literature), but they may be extra
evidence that Katcha speakers do not distinguish between these morphemes.
   3
     The team also sometimes write <tammo> and <tanno>, but I am not convinced the consonant is
long.

      evidence.
Having noted the evidence that já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are phonologically conditioned
allomorphs, the question arises as to the nature of this morpheme. Based on the
morphosyntactic properties presented in sections 5.1-5.3, this section argues that it is
in fact the proximal demonstrative pronoun, acting as head of the modiﬁer phrase. A
possible alternative answer is that the já/mɔ́/nɔ́ morpheme is simply a general marker
of modiﬁcation. The latter suggestion does not ﬁt the Katcha data as well as the
analysis proposed here but it should be noted that the two analyses are related, and in
section 5.5.2 it is speculated that Katcha may be in the midst of a move from one to
the other.
     It was demonstrated in sections 5.1-5.3 that demonstratives, possessive noun phrases
and relative clauses all display the same morphosyntactic properties with respect to
gender agreement, the modiﬁcation of peripheral arguments and pronominal use. Some
relevant examples are repeated below (5.36-5.44).4Gender agreement(5.36), (5.37) and (5.38) demonstrate that gender agreement is exhibited by demon-
stratives, possessives and relatives, respectively.(5.36) a. omuɗi já              aɗiːla

              ‘That one (way over there)’     The medial and distal demonstratives behave exactly like all other modiﬁers, except
that they do not take j-/m-/n- ‘preﬁxes’. This concurs with the evidence presented
in the preceding sections that j-/m-/n- are not preﬁxes which attach to modiﬁers,
but are themselves the modiﬁers. Moreover, the only nominal modiﬁers which are
not of the form já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are the medial and distal demonstratives. If the já/mɔ́/nɔ́
morpheme which introduces a possessive noun phrase or a relative clause is the prox-
imal demonstrative, then there is a uniﬁed analysis which accounts for all examples:
nouns in Katcha may be modiﬁed only by demonstratives, or by phrases headed by
demonstratives.
     As mentioned in section 5.1.2, there is evidence that demonstratives should be con-
sidered pronouns rather than determiners; in fact, there are no determiners in Katcha.
Since there are also no adjectives, Katcha has no modiﬁers that are unambiguously
internal to the noun phrase. This suggests that lexical nouns form complete noun
phrases and cannot be modiﬁed directly, from within the noun phrase. That is to say,
a noun phrase (in Minimalist terms, a DP) may be made up only of a noun. The
demonstrative is a pronoun which can be considered to stand in apposition with the
noun, taking its reference anaphorically. (5.2′ ) & (5.6c′ ) repeat some of the examples
given earlier, with an altered free translation which is more reﬂective of this analysis:(5.2′ ) a a n-asáːsá     ɲɔrɔɲɔrɔ́ já
        1sg 1sg-want k.o.spear prox.m
        ‘I want a spear, this one’

the modiﬁer’s interpretation, as summarised in table 5.3.
    When the demonstrative is followed by a noun, it is interpreted with a possessive
meaning. (5.10c′ ), (5.11′ ) & (5.17′ ) repeat some of the examples given earlier, with
glosses and free translations more reﬂective of this analysis. Note that in the case of
(5.17′ ) the free translation does not actually require to be changed at all from that

a subject relative clause. The demonstrative pronoun replaces the subject agreement
marker in this case. If the subject agreement marker is thought of as an incorporated
pronoun (as suggested by Norton (2008b)), then this is entirely natural. One pronoun,
the demonstrative, has simply taken the place of another, the subject marker (5.18′ ):(5.18′ ) miːte [j-akʊ́              ɔ́ːjɔ́    já   ] amaːla

86                                      Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Nominal ModiﬁersIn the case of non-subject relatives, Stevenson (1941:68) notes that they are formed in
Katcha using a construction parallel to that used for possessives. The relative clause
is non-ﬁnite or nominalised, as indicated by the dependent clause marker ka (and
also sometimes the inﬁnitive marker t-). Thus non-subject relatives can be seen as
a ‘possessive’ relation holding between two ‘nominals’: the head noun, and the event
described by the relative clause. (5.21′ ) & (5.22b′ ) repeat examples given earlier, with
glosses and free translations more reﬂective of this analysis.(5.21′ ) a a n-ɪcɪ ́     ráːká [já        fi ́ːjɔ ka   t-akʊ́rɪ kɪte     já       ]
         1sg 1sg-see ﬁeld         prox.m cow dcm inf-eat there rel.m
         ‘I see a ﬁeld, this one of the cow’s eating grass in it’
(5.22b′ ) kɔːkɔ́rɔ́ [m -́ t́ ́          ka    ɪcɪ ́ ɔ́ːkɔ́ mɔ́   ] m-ɔʈɔ́         mereké
           hen         prox.f-1sg dcm see 3f              rel.f 3f-peck sesame
           ‘A hen, this one of my seeing it, is eating sesame’     It should be noted that the morpheme at the end of a relative clause does not
quite ﬁt the analysis as explained here. It does not seem to be appositional to any
other nouns and does not take a t- preﬁx when within an oblique phrase. Both of
these facts follow from its position at the end of the clause in that it does not directly
follow the modiﬁed noun, and the t- preﬁx attaches to the clause-initial morpheme.
Note also that its status is somewhat unclear. Stevenson (1956-57:63-64) states that it
marks deﬁniteness, implying that it is optional. If this were true, the analysis should
be straightforward, conﬁrming the morpheme to be a demonstrative. On the other
hand, Gilley (2013:502) suggests that it is obligatory for masculine nouns, optional
for feminine, and unattested for plural, which would make the analysis somewhat
trickier. Neither of these descriptions quite match my data: the relative clause-ﬁnal
marker seems to be present fairly consistently. Interestingly though, in chapter 10
a Dynamic Syntax analysis of Katcha relative clauses is given which assumes the
clause-ﬁnal relative marker to be a demonstrative. On the basis of that assumption it
transpires that the role of the ﬁnal morpheme is to contribute deﬁniteness; in other
words, Stevenson is predicted to be correct.
     The analysis that nominal modiﬁers comprise noun phrases in apposition, gets
some extra support from the wider tendencies of Katcha syntax, in that Katcha has a
tendency also to put verbs and clauses in apposition. Thus, while (5.49) is a perfectly
grammatical way of expressing the proposition ‘Kuku is a tall man’, (5.50) is equally
grammatical, and probably more common.
5.5. Cross-linguistic connections                                                     87(5.49) kʊ́kkʊ̂ omuɗi ́ j-ɔ́ʈɔ́ŋkɔrɔ      já
        Kuku man        prox.m-be.long rel.m
        ‘Kuku is a man, this one who is tall’
(5.50) kʊ́kkʊ̂ omuɗi ́ ɔ́ʈɔ́ŋkɔrɔ
        Kuku man        3m.be.long
        ‘Kuku is a man, he is tall’Overall, then, the analysis of nominal modiﬁers as (phrases headed by) demonstrative
pronouns in apposition to the modiﬁed noun is to be favoured. This analysis allows the
medial and distal demonstratives to be treated alongside the proximal demonstrative.
It is not strange that the medial and distal demonstratives do not carry the j-/m-/n-
preﬁxes; the ‘preﬁxes’ are in fact the proximal demonstrative. The analysis proposed
here also ﬁts both the simple structure of Katcha noun phrases (no determiners or
adjectives) and the tendency of Katcha to also put verb phrases in apposition.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]"

Chapter 1IntroductionThis thesis presents a new description and theoretical analysis of the nominal system
of the Katcha language.
   Katcha is spoken in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan, and like the majority of Nuba
languages, is relatively endangered and relatively little-studied. It is a member of the
Kadu language family, whose genetic classiﬁcation has been the subject of considerable
debate over the years. The description oﬀered here is based on a synthesis of data
from several sources, including unpublished archive material and original ﬁeldwork,
and represents a considerable increase in the amount of Katcha data publicly available.
Several of the ﬁndings are noteworthy from the point of view of typology and cross-
linguistic comparison. The descriptive analyses are summarised in section 1.2 below.
   The theoretical analyses use the framework of Dynamic Syntax (Kempson et al.
2001; Cann et al. 2005). This framework has previously been applied to Bantu lan-
guages, but not to any African languages outside that family. Applying a framework
to new language data from a relatively unknown language family is a good test of
the framework’s ﬂexibility in adapting to handle constructions other than the ‘usual
suspects’ of Germanic and Romance; it is also a good test of a theory’s ability to
make sense of the data. I have found some of the phenomena analysed here more
comprehensible as a result of looking at them in the light of Dynamic Syntax, but
the framework has also had to be adjusted and extended in the light of the Katcha
data. Such interaction between theory and data can only be healthy. The theoretical
analyses are summarised in section 1.3 below.","[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

9.6 Case markers
As noted in chapter 6, the boundary between case markers and adpositions is somewhat
fuzzy, yet the analyses that have been proposed for case in Dynamic Syntax look rather
diﬀerent from the treatment of prepositions proposed here, at least on the surface. Case
has been treated as deﬁning ‘ﬁlters on output, imposing requirements on a node which
constrain subsequent development’. Speciﬁcally, case constrains which node in the tree
a noun may decorate (Cann et al. 2005:236). For example, nominative case can be
modelled as a requirement ?⟨↑0 ⟩T y(es → t) imposed on a term node requiring that its
mother takes the propositional event node as an argument, thus that term must be
the logical subject. Case is therefore primarily structural. This contrasts with the
analysis of adpositions proposed above in which prepositions introduce subordinate
propositions that modify some term in the matrix proposition. Adpositions therefore
contribute semantic content. This apparent diﬀerence is surprising if there really is
‘no necessary universal distinction’ (Payne 1997:100) between adpositions and case
markers. But the diﬀerence does not lie in whether a particular lexical item is classed
212                                       Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Caseas an adposition or a case marker. The diﬀerence between the two structures lies in the
relationship between the semantic role of the nominal and the participant roles required
by the verb. Where the noun phrase has a core argument role, the required roles are
deﬁned by the subcategorization properties of the verb and case can be thought of as
specifying which of these argument roles a given noun phrase fulﬁls. Where the noun
phrase has an optional, oblique role, the case marker or adposition must itself specify
the semantics. To put this in terms of the tree construction process, in the case of
core arguments the argument nodes are constructed as part of the lexical actions of
the predicate and case then constrains the further development of these pre-existing
nodes, ensuring they are decorated correctly; in the case of oblique arguments, the
argument nodes must be constructed by the adposition/case marker, along with the
relevant predicate.
      So one possibility is that dative a is a case marker in the standard DS sense, its
lexical actions acting as a ﬁlter on pre-existing structure rather than building new
structure. If so, this would explain why it requires to be licensed by the applicative
marker on the verb. A further piece of evidence in support of this is the fact that
a marks the indirect object of ditransitive verbs such as anáŋá, ‘give’. In this case,
the indirect object node is presumably constructed as part of the propositional tree
projected by the verb, so again, the dative does not need to build new structure.
    A quite diﬀerent construction involving an a morpheme marking a noun is found in
(9.42), where there is an example of a marking a subject. Norton (2008a:9) suggests it
marks a change of subject within the discourse and such an analysis seems plausible in
this case, where the ﬁrst clause focuses on the ravens, before the second clause brings
in sɔkɔ (‘God’) as the subject.(9.42)         aga    ïïrï   nakaaru taalo katïnïïkï                kitaalo    karaana         ka

      This is also true of dative a.
9.6. Case markers                                                                                        213It always occurs at the left periphery of the clause, which often shows non-canonical
verbal morphology marking the verb either with inﬁnitive t- or, as here, the dependent
clause marker ka. A detailed analysis of these sorts of discourse features is outwith
the scope of the current study, but whatever the analysis, it seems clear that nouns
marked with a are not treated by the syntax as canonical subjects. It may well be more
accurate to think of them as something like hanging topics.
      The fact that this appears to be another case of a noun being marked by an a brings
up the intriguing possibility is that this subject-marking a and the dative a may in fact
be the same morpheme. That is, it may be possible to characterise the lexical actions
of dative a in a way that captures all three constructions in which a-marked nouns
occur. (9.43) sketches the immediate contexts of each of these with the relevant node
highlighted by the presence of the pointer: as the applied object of an applicative verb
(a), as the indirect object of a ditransitive verb (b), and preverbally as something like
a newly introduced topical subject (c).9(9.43) a.

"2.3.3 MorphosyntaxKatchaThe only recently published work in Katcha morphosyntax is Gilley (2013). This is a
comprehensive study of number-marking in Katcha nouns and is discussed in chapter
4. One other paper which has been made somewhat more widely available is Waag
(2012), an (as yet unpublished) conference presentation on Katcha pronouns and case-
marking/prepositions which is discussed in chapter 6.
   Other than these two papers there is a limited amount of work on Katcha mor-
phosyntax that has been done more recently in Khartoum, mainly in the context of
20                                                                Preliminaries: Backgroundliteracy and language development projects. This primarily consists of write-ups from
linguistic workshops held with Katcha speakers in Khartoum between 2006 and 2009,
plus transcriptions of several narrative texts recorded in the home area.2Other Kadu languagesMore published data does exist in a few of the other Kadu languages, though none have
been studied by more than a couple of scholars. Given that these languages are quite
closely related to Katcha, there are insights to be gained from the ﬁndings of these
researchers.
      The most extensively documented of the Kadu languages is Krongo. This is the
only language in the family for which a full-length grammar description exists, namely
Reh (1985). In addition to this monograph, Reh (1983) summarises in English some
of her typologically interesting ﬁndings. An alternative analysis of some of the data is
found in Dimmendaal’s (1987) review.
      As well as her larger work on Krongo, Reh has produced a grammar sketch of Keiga,
published as Reh (1994).
      Krongo and Keiga, then, are arguably the best documented of the Kadu languages.
Unfortunately, they are also the most distantly related from Katcha, as per the group-
ings given in Table 2.1. The only language from Stevenson’s ‘central’ grouping for which
data has been published is Kadugli, with two published works: Abdalla (1969) and
Matsushita (1984, 1986). The former has the distinction of being the ﬁrst attempt at
theoretical linguistic analysis of any of the Kadu languages. Unfortunately, this renders
it somewhat dated; written from the standpoint of early Transformational Grammar,
the majority of the content is given to the formulation of transformation rules. It is
therefore less useful to the present enterprise than might have been hoped. Matsushita’s
work is based around vocabulary: after giving an overview of both nominal and verbal
morphology, the majority of the articles are taken up by the provision of an extensive
word list.
      More recent, though unpublished, material on a ‘central’ Kadu language can be
found in Sukkar (2014), a conference presentation on verbal morphology in Miri, which
summarizes her MA dissertation.

2.4. Fieldwork and other data sources                                                  212.4 Fieldwork and other data sources
The current study is based on data from the sources discussed above, but also original
data collected through ﬁeldwork in Khartoum between November 2012 and May 2013.
During this time I worked with two members of the Katcha community in Khartoum.
Both were male, aged in their forties and speakers of the Tuna dialect of Katcha. Both
men were born and grew up in the language area, speaking Katcha as their mother
tongue and in most childhood contexts, though being educated in Arabic from the age
of eight. However both had moved to Khartoum at relatively young ages and had lived
in Khartoum for many years (24 years in one case, 36 years in the other). Within
Khartoum both are active within the expatriate Katcha community and continue to
speak Katcha at home and socially. One of the men works as a mechanic and therefore
speaks Arabic at work, but the other is employed as a mother tongue literacy worker
within the Katcha community and therefore teaches, reads and writes Katcha as well
as speaking it most of the time. In addition to Katcha, both men are ﬂuent in Sudanese
Arabic and have a reasonable level of English.
   My contact with Katcha speakers was largely limited to formal language sessions
with my two main contacts. The community were wary of foreigners coming to their
neighbourhood due to security concerns, so language sessions were conducted at my
house and I did not get much contact with the wider community. Once a week, I sat in
on a translation checking session with the Katcha Bible translation team (a further two
native speakers) and a translation consultant, though those sessions were conducted in
English.
   Language sessions, which happened once or twice per week, were a mixture of con-
trolled elicitation and text elicitation. In order to make the most of potentially limited
ﬁeldwork time, my controlled elicitation concentrated on morphosyntactic features of
the language, eg. agreement paradigms, rather than collecting vocabulary.
   The data presented in this study is representative of the morphosyntactic data
collected during ﬁeldwork. Audio recordings were made of the majority of it. A list
of about 130 nouns in both singular and plural forms was also collected. In addition,
three oral texts were recorded, transcribed and analysed using Fieldworks Language
Explorer (FLEx) to create a small database of lexical and functional morphemes.
   A further resource is the text of the draft Katcha New Testament. The translation
group have kindly granted me online reader access to their unpublished draft. The
draft is currently under revision, which means it has a tendency to change, and it is
translated material so may not necessarily always be in traditional Katcha cultural or
literary style, but it nonetheless represents a substantial corpus of textual data and
has proven a very helpful source of syntactic examples. An associated resource is the
list of verbs found in the text which is maintined by the translation consultant. This
22                                                             Preliminaries: Backgroundcurrently lists approximately 470 verbs.
     It should be noted that of these various sources of Katcha data, the vast majority
are written only. In particular the two largest sources, Stevenson’s (1941) grammar and
the draft Katcha New Testament are written with no tone and with some inconsistency
with regard to the balance between phonetic detail and morphophonemic consistency.
(More details are given on these matters in chapter 3.) Throughout this thesis I have
therefore tried to use my own data where possible and use examples from the Bible or
Stevenson’s data only sparingly, or to provide extra discussion for speciﬁc hypotheses.","[38, 39, 40, 41]"

5.6 Conclusion
There are, phonetically, ﬁve sets of morphemes marking nominal modiﬁers in Katcha,
namely j-/m-/n-, já/má/ná, já/mɔ́/nɔ́, ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and i ́nːi ̂/umːû. These serve various
functions, marking proximal, medial and distal demonstratives, possessives, subject
relative clauses and non-subject relative clauses. As implied by table 5.2, the correlation
between the surface phonetic form of the morpheme and its syntactic function is
not completely clear. To reduce this mix of forms and functions to something more
systematic is obviously desirable from the point of view of analytical elegance. However,
it is also desirable for data-driven reasons: with the exception of the medial and
distal demonstrative pronouns, there is considerable uniformity in the form of nominal
modiﬁers and an understanding of how they are related would shed considerable light
on the workings of the language.
     With regard to the similarities of form, it was argued in section 5.4.1 that there
is in fact only one ‘j/m/n-style’ morpheme, with the variant pronunciations due to
intonation-based allomorphy. This leaves three forms to give an analysis for: i ́nːi ̂/umːû,
ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and já/mɔ́/nɔ́. The ﬁrst two of these are uncontroversial, being the distal
and medial demonstrative pronouns respectively. The third includes the proximal
demonstrative pronoun, but is also used in all other nominal modiﬁers. One possible
analysis of the syntactic function of this latter morpheme is that it simply marks
modiﬁcation generally. However, this does not account for the fact that the medial
and distal demonstratives do not exhibit this marking, whereas the proximal demon-
strative, along with relative clauses and possessive noun phrases, does. In section
5.4.2 it was therefore argued that a better analysis is to assume that the three forms
já/mɔ́/nɔ́, ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and i ́nːi ̂/umːû represent the three demonstrative pronouns and that
other Katcha nominal modiﬁers are phrases headed by a demonstrative pronoun. All
modiﬁers stand in a relationship of apposition to the modiﬁed noun. This approach
allows a uniﬁed treatment of the various types of modiﬁer, including the medial and
distal demonstratives. It is supported by the fact that there are no words in Katcha
5.6. Conclusion                                                                     93which can be unambiguously categorised as determiners or adjectives; lexical nouns
appear to form complete noun phrases which do not allow phrase-internal modiﬁcation.
Nominal modiﬁcation is therefore achieved by apposition of an external phrase.
   Finally, as noted in section 5.5, the analysis adopted here can be placed in a wider
context within African linguistics. The demonstrative which heads the appositional
modiﬁer shows gender agreement with the head noun, thereby encoding the function
of ‘Attribution’ and connecting the modiﬁer with the head. In this way it acts as
a relative marker of the type found in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages. A
prototypical relative marker is not a pronoun and indeed the demonstrative does not
show the subordinate clause case marking that would be expected of a relative pronoun.
Nonetheless, it was argued in section 5.4.2 that the demonstrative is best considered
to be a pronoun. So it is not a fully prototypical relative marker, though it may be
in process of being grammaticalized as such. Similarly, the possessive construction in
Katcha does not alter the form of the head noun and therefore is not quite an example
of the construct state found in many African languages, but it does represent the
kind of structure from which such a phenomenon could develop. Construing nominal
modiﬁers as appositional phrases headed by a demonstrative pronoun not only provides
a uniﬁed analysis of the Katcha data, but also gives an example of one way in which
two seemingly unrelated, typically African constructions might derive from a common
source.
Chapter 6Pronouns and PrepositionsIntroduction
This chapter presents a description of personal pronouns in Katcha and aims to explain
the diﬀerences between the various forms. There are two basic sets of pronominal
forms, which I label ‘Core’ pronouns and ‘Oblique’ pronouns, and these are described
in section 6.1. The choice of pronominal form is dependent on the role it plays in
the sentence and also, in oblique cases, which preposition it follows. A description
of prepositions and similar morphemes, incuding the pronominal forms they select, is
therefore presented in sections 6.2 and 6.3. The following two sections discuss other
aspects of the prepositional system, namely the modiﬁcation of (primarily locative)
prepositional phrases by adverbs or further prepositional phrases (section 6.4) and the
lexical selection of prepositions by certain verbs (section 6.5). The chapter concludes
by returning to the discussion of pronominal forms in section 6.6, where it is suggested
that these diﬀerent forms may be best described as realisations of case. Taking into
account evidence from tone alternations and typological universals, it is tentatively
concluded that Katcha personal pronouns occur in one of three three cases: Nominative,
Accusative and Oblique.","[111, 112, 113, 114]"

with ka. For now it is suﬃcient to see how straightforwardly non-subject relatives may
be integrated into the overall analysis of nominal modiﬁers.10
10.5 Conclusion
The analysis of Katcha nominal modiﬁers proposed in chapter 5 is that they are
uniformly ‘headed’ by demonstrative pronouns appositional to the noun phrase. This
is modelled in the Dynamic Syntax framework using a general computational rule
of Appositive LINK Introduction (10.4). This rule constructs a LINK relation
between two type e nodes which are decorated by epsilon terms projected by two noun
phrases, namely the modiﬁed NP (a lexical noun) and the modiﬁer ‘headed’ by a
demonstrative pronoun. The corresponding evaluation rule (10.9) merges the two into
a single epsilon term with a conjoined restrictor. Thus the properties projected by two
noun phrases in apposition can only be interpreted as holding of a single individual.
       The analysis of demonstrative pronouns presented here extends the actions as-
sociated with them to include the construction of more semantic structure than is
standard in Dynamic Syntax. Pronouns are seen not only to be placeholders but also
to build partial epsilon structures. Speciﬁcally, they project an argument variable and
an epsilon binder, but no restrictor. The restrictor may be provided by substitution
of a referent from context, in which case the demonstrative has a deﬁnite, pronominal
interpretation (section 10.1). Alternatively, it may be provided by a verb, in which
case the demonstrative essentially acts as a relative pronoun (section 10.2). Another
possibility is that the restrictor’s value is constructed from some contextually provided
value expressing some relationship, such as possession, between the argument variable
and some other term (section 10.3). These possibilities directly model the analysis of
chapter 5 where it was argued that the interpretation of a demonstrative pronoun is
dependent on what follows in the rest of the modiﬁer phrase.
       The fact that the demonstrative pronoun projects an internal argument node and
decorates it with a variable restricts how the metavariable can be updated by substitu-
tion and means that the analysis predicts certain correlations which do not necesarily
seem to be related at ﬁrst. For example, the analysis predicts correctly that only
subjects can be relativised directly. Similarly, the predicate of possession is forced to
have as its logical subject the possessee rather than the possessor, which reﬂects the
  10
    An alternative approach would be to assume that the relative clause provides context to enrich
some semantically weak predicate (possibly a metavariable) which holds of the head noun. In this
case the dependent clause marker presumably marks the fact that the verb does not predicate over
the nominal variable but has some other relation to it. Again, a full analysis will need to wait until
the DCM has been studied more carefully. If this were the correct analysis, it would be likely to have
implications for the present account of the semantically weak predicate P OSSD.
250                                         Theoretical Analyses: Nominal Modiﬁersfact that the demonstrative pronoun agrees with the gender of the possessee and not
the possessor.
   Key to this analysis is the strong distinction between pronouns and lexical nouns.
The construal of pronouns as underspeciﬁed forms — metavariables which act as a
placeholder to be updated by additional linguistic or non-linguistic information — con-
trasts with lexical nouns which project macros of actions that build relatively complex
semantic structure. In Katcha, where there are no determiners and no adjectives, the
semantic structure built by lexical nouns is fully speciﬁed and nouns cannot therefore
be modiﬁed directly. The analysis presented both in chapter 5 and here draws a
clear distinction between lexical nouns and pronouns. Lexical nouns form complete
noun phrases in their own right; they cannot be speciﬁed by a determiner or modiﬁed
‘directly’, only by an appositional phrase. The demonstrative pronoun, in contrast,
can be the ‘head’ of a larger phrase which may include modiﬁers. Of course, there are
similarities between nouns and pronouns, both being of semantic type e, but in terms
of syntax — that is, the procedural actions associated with the words — the diﬀerence
is stark. The structure projected by pronouns is fundamentally underspeciﬁed. Nouns
project entire epsilon-structures; pronouns, even the non-standard version presented
here, retain their function of acting as placeholders to be updated by the parsing of
other lexical material. As such, it is no surprise that pronouns should behave diﬀerently
from nouns in allowing ‘direct’ modiﬁcation.
   In contrast, theoretical frameworks which assume that nouns and pronouns both
belong to the same syntactic category, such as ‘DP’, might require more stipulation to
explain why lexical DPs cannot be modiﬁed while pronominal DPs can. This is not to
say that the task would be impossible for such frameworks, but in Dynamic Syntax, it
falls out naturally from the grammar.
Chapter 11ConclusionsIntroduction
This study has been data-led. It did not begin from the position of having a speciﬁc
hypothesis to be tested (other than the very general hypothesis that Dynamic Syntax
may be a suitable framework for the analysis of phenomena found in Nilo-Saharan
languages). Rather, the goal was to investigate the Katcha language with an open
mind, ﬁnd out what was interesting about it and then try to provide a Dynamic Syntax
analysis for that. But in the process certain ﬁndings and themes have emerged. This
concluding chapter starts by summarizing the main ﬁndings of signiﬁcance from the
individual studies in each chapter, before going on to pull out some more general themes.
   Section 11.1 describes some of the main ﬁndings from part II of the thesis. These
are in the areas of number and gender classiﬁcation and nominal modiﬁers. In both of
these areas Katcha exhibits phenomena which have connections with the surrounding
linguistic context, even though some are typologically unusual.
   Section 11.2 summarizes the main ﬁndings from each of the three chapters of
Dynamic Syntax theoretical analysis, pointing out where the theory has had to be
extended or adjusted to ﬁt the data and also any other theoretical implications resulting
from the analyses.
   Finally, section 11.3 provides some ﬁnal comments about what these ﬁndings mean
conceptually.","[267, 268, 269, 270]"

7.4 Reciprocal and Reﬂexive
In (7.7), repeated here as (7.36), -ceːné is given as a possible Reciprocal suﬃx.(7.36) a. kʊ́kkʊ́ ɪcɪ ́           ɓɪ ́ːɓálá
               Kuku 3m.wake boy
               ‘Kuku wakes the boy’
           b. laːlá ɪcɪ-   n ́
               boys 3m.wake-recip
               ‘the children wake each other’Given the pattern that exists in Katcha of verb extensions marking information about
the arguments of the verb, it is natural to suppose that the Reciprocal marker should be
considered to belong to this group of suﬃxes. However, there is also evidence that casts
doubt on this analysis, suggesting that the Reciprocal marker should not be considered
a suﬃx which changes the verb’s argument structure, but a pronominal element which
is the object of the verb.10 There are two pieces of evidence which might support the
latter view.
       The ﬁrst comes from the form of the morpheme: it seems clear that the Reciprocal
marker is derived from either the Accompaniment preposition nca or the verb cɔ ‘go’
(which may be used to indicate directionality; see section 6.3.1), plus the 3rd person
plural pronoun ené. Thus it is literally ‘with/to them’. Of course the fact that the
Reciprocal marker looks like a pronoun does not prove that it is synchronically a
pronoun, rather than historically derived from one, but it may be.
       The second piece of evidence comes from the fact that Katcha reﬂexives (which are,
of course, conceptually very similar to reciprocals) are not expressed using a verbal
suﬃx, but using an idiomatic possessed noun phrase, sometimes using ɔ́ːna, ‘body’, as
  10
    It is not one of the goals of this study to develop a theory of wordhood in Katcha. I have no strong
opinions on whether -ceːné should be considered a suﬃx, clitic or word. However, if it could be shown
that -ceːné should be analysed as a separate word, that would rule out the possibility of it being a verb
extension.

cals would also be expressed using a (pro)nominal construction. However, the evidence
is fairly inconclusive so it is possible that the Reciprocal marker may in fact be a verb
extension after all.","[163, 164]"

epsilon structure is built and decorated with copies of the formulae as speciﬁed by the
lexical actions. Applying these actions in the context of (8.23) generates the tree in

is to resolve the outstanding requirements, including instantiating the metavariables.
With the pointer sitting on the epsilon-internal logical subject node, this can be imme-
diately instantiated by uniﬁcation with the unﬁxed node decorated with F o(Kuku′ ).
This is a slightly surprising turn of events, in that ‘Kuku’ is the sentential subject and
would therefore be expected to decorate the matrix subject node, but here it is uniﬁed
with the ‘subject’ node which is internal to the matrix object. However, this is not a
problem since the two nodes are linked by the copy mechanism, so must end up being
decorated with the same Formula value. It just happens to be that the incremental
nature of Dynamic Syntax entails the lower node be instantiated ﬁrst (8.25).

    The tree in (8.26) has a distinctly recursive look to it. As is standard, the completed
tree is a type t proposition and its arguments are type e epsilon terms. However,
epsilon terms contain propositions within them, and in (8.26) the proposition within
the logical object is virtually identical to the matrix proposition because its value is
built up entirely from the immediate context. The semantic contribution of the object is
simply the fact that it is the object of the proposition. Thus the formula decorating the
root node of the propositional tree is (8.27) which expresses the proposition that Kuku
laughs at a, where a is some arbitrary thing that Kuku laughs at. This proposition is
truth conditionally equivalent to ∃x[Laugh.at′ (x)(Kuku′ )(si )].

           where a = ϵx , Laugh.at′ (x)(Kuku′ )(si )      The Dynamic Syntax formalism, and its use of epsilon calculus in particular, thus
enables us to model the intutition that a detransitivised verb (marked in Katcha by an
antipassive suﬃx) expresses the action of an agent on some object, but that the identity
of this object is both irrelevant to the proposition expressed and entirely dependent on
the context. In essence, the object’s only semantic content is the fact that it is the
object of the predicate.
      In section 7.2.1 it was noted that, according to Stevenson (1941:58), it is possible
for antipassive verbs to appear with ‘indeﬁnite objects’, leading to a generic or object-
incorporating interpretation (7.16). This data does not necessarily conﬂict with the
analysis given here, since the apparent object does not take its canonical thematic
role: it is not the patient of the action described by the verb. One possibility might
be that the lexical object is LINKed to the main propositional tree, providing some
additional semantic content.8 So (7.16) ‘the boy cow-milks’ might in fact be structured
as something like (8.28): ‘the boy milks some arbitrary object of his milking, and the
arbitrary object of the boy’s milking are cows’.","[180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"

demonstrative this update comes from context; in the case of the relative clause it comes
from parsing the immediately following predicate, which can be done straightforwardly
since the trigger for parsing a predicate is an open ?T y(t) node. However, in the case of
a possessive noun phrase, such as that given in (10.24), the demonstrative pronoun is
followed by a noun phrase referring to the possessor. At ﬁrst glance, this would appear
to be problematic: other than the node decorated by a metavariable, the only node
available to be developed is the open ?T y(t) node. This is the usual context for parsing
a predicate, but there are no predicates to be parsed within the modiﬁer.
   A solution to this apparent problem is to assume with Kempson et al. (2001) that
possession is a relation between two individuals and that as such, it entails some
contextually deﬁned predicate. In Kempson et al. (2001)’s account of the English
genitive, this predicate is projected by the genitive case-marker ’s. In Katcha, there
is no morpheme marking possession because the ‘possessive’ marker is in fact the
demonstrative pronoun. The possessive predicate cannot therefore be projected by
this morpheme. Instead, the modifying noun is known to be a possessor because it
appears in a particular context, namely, immediately following the demonstrative. In
other words, possession in Katcha is not marked morphologically, but by syntactic
position.
   Formalising this construction is then a case of formalising the observation that when
a noun occurs in the correct syntactic context — following a demonstrative pronoun —
it has a possessive interpretation. This can easily be done by giving nouns a disjunctive
lexical entry, one of the disjuncts being actions to construct a predicate of possession
given the appropriate trigger. It is then simply a matter of deﬁning this trigger formally.
(10.26) gives one possible formulation of the lexical entry for the name Kuku. The ﬁrst
disjunct is a standard set of lexical actions for parsing a noun in an ordinary argument
context. The second disjunct is the one relevant to the current discussion. This states
that in the correct context (to be discussed below), an argument node is constructed
and decorated with the semantic content usually associated with the noun, but that,
in addition, a predicate node is constructed and decorated with a possession relation.
Ultimately this predicate will express the relationship between the referent of the noun
and the variable previously projected by the demonstrative.

                            ELSE      abortThe exact nature of the trigger for the second disjunct may need to be reﬁned. It
requires to be speciﬁc enough that a noun will only be interpreted as a possessor
in the appropriate context. Clearly, ?T y(t) would not be suﬃciently speciﬁc to the
context and would overgenerate. It may be that the context described in (10.26) is
still too general and requires to be adjusted, perhaps by making reference to the LINK
relation. However, the exact formulation of the trigger does not aﬀect the overall
analysis. The important thing is that in the correct context, following the parsing
of a demonstrative pronoun as part of a nominal modiﬁer, the lexical actions of a
noun indicate its interpretation as possessor by constructing the appropriate predicate.
For now I assume that ?T y(t), ⟨↑0 ⟩T y(e) is a suﬃcient description of the context in
which these actions are executed. This context reﬂects the fact that the demonstrative
pronoun has already been parsed and has decorated the root node of the LINKed
epsilon-tree with a type e metavariable.
   The lexical actions deﬁned in (10.26) make the parsing of sentence (10.24) quite
straightforward. After the demonstrative has been parsed, the partial semantic tree
is as in (10.25). As was the case for relative clauses, the pointer will move down the
tree to develop the open ?T y(t) node. The noun may now be parsed with the context
ensuring that the possessive set of actions are executed, leading to the tree in (10.27).

et al. (2001) describe it as a semantically relatively weak predicate, a ‘relation whose
value is constructed from some contextually provided value’ (Kempson et al. 2001:145).
The case they consider is the English genitive and so they consider the predicate to be
a binary relation with the possessor as its logical subject and the possessee as its logical
object. For simplicity, they represent the predicate as P OSS. In the Katcha case, the
logical subject of this possession relation is the variable representing the possessee which
10.3. Possessive NPs                                                                                245is projected by the demonstrative pronoun. The relation is therefore the inverse of that
suggested by Kempson et al. (2001), and for convenience is written here as P OSSD to
make the diﬀerence explicit. (It can be thought of as ‘x is possessed by y’.) At ﬁrst this
seems like a slightly clumsy approach — hypothesising an implict predicate which may
be construed one way in one language but exactly inversely in another — but there
are two points to be made in its defence. One is that if the value of the predicate is
contextually provided, it might well be expected to vary from language to language.
The second point is that this diﬀerence is not unmotivated, but in fact reﬂects the
morphology of the two languages rather neatly. English possessives are constructed
using a dependent-marking strategy, that is, with morphological marking (‘genitive
case’) on the modifying noun (the possessor). Contrastingly, Katcha possessives are
head-marking8 and are expressed using something much closer to a construct state,
as was noted in section 5.5.2. The Katcha ‘possessive marker’, ie. the demonstrative
pronoun, does not morphologically mark the head noun (the possessee), but it is
associated with it by agreement and anaphorically. So the apparent diﬀerence between
the two languages in the semantics of the possession predicate may in fact be exactly
what we should expect to see, given their contrasting marking strategies for possessives.
If so, far from being clumsy, this is a very nice result. The analysis of the demonstrative
pronoun given in section 10.2 is that it shares an argument variable with the noun it
modiﬁes. This analysis was motivated by the need to account for relative clauses. But
a side eﬀect of that analysis is that in the case of possessives the logical subject of the
possession predicate must be the shared variable, forcing the possession predicate to
be P OSSD rather than P OSS. This directly reﬂects the morphology of possessive
constructions, because Katcha uses (something close to) a head-marking construct
strategy rather than a dependant-marking genitive strategy.9
   8
     Or at least, ‘head-aligned’, through agreement relations.
   9
     Although positing two alternative possession predicates reﬂects the morphology of possessive
constructions quite neatly, it is not obvious that such a distinction should exist in the semantics.
Assuming that the genitive construction in English and the possessive construction in Katcha express
the same semantic relation, it should perhaps be expected that there would be only one ‘P OSS-type’
relation. If so, the analysis given here forces this predicate to be expressed as the Katcha version with
the head, the possessee, as the external argument, rather than the inverse. Kempson et al. (2001)
make no strong claims for their assumed P OSS relation, describing it only as a relation whose value
is contextually provided, holding between the possessor and the possessee. Likewise, I do not wish to
make any strong claims about this predicate other than to suggest that if there is indeed only one such
relation, it is better to think of it as a property of the head noun, i.e. some relation holding between
the head noun and some modiﬁer.

dinate clause being introduced by a demonstrative pronoun and also being concluded
with one (probably to mark deﬁniteness). However, the internal structure of the relative
clause is diﬀerent – a non-ﬁnite verb is used, being marked with a dependent clause
marker (and sometimes an inﬁnitive). A resumptive pronoun marking the relativised
element is also common; this does not occur in the case of subject relatives.
   A fully worked-out analysis of the internal structure of non-subject relative clauses
will be dependent on an analysis of the dependent clause marker ka and the discourse
properties of non-ﬁnite clauses, which is outwith the scope of the current study. How-
ever, it is possible to note a few points about how non-subject relative clauses may ﬁt
into the overall account of nominal modiﬁers.
   On the basis of the analysis presented so far, it is obvious why non-subject positions
cannot be relativised. The lexical actions of the demonstrative pronoun, as deﬁned in
(10.17), construct the partial epsilon tree in (10.18), repeated here as (10.30).","[259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265]"

variation resides in the lexicon – and (8.7) shows an example of this. The lexical
actions in (8.6) reﬂect the fact that Katcha is a full pro-drop language by decorating
the argument nodes with metavariables, represented as U and V. Metavariables are
objects which act as placeholders for contentful Formula values. They do not constitute
expressions in the epsilon/lambda calculi and so must be replaced by such an expression,
this is marked formally by the requirement ?∃x.F o(x). In this way, they satisfy a type
requirement but replace it with a formula requirement. The formula requirement does
not have to be fulﬁlled through a linguistic source. One way it may be done is through
Substitution, a pragmatic process in which a suitable referent is chosen from context.
Thus (8.8) is a grammatical sentence. (In non-pro-drop languages the argument nodes
are decorated merely with a type requirement (?T y(e)), meaning that Substitution
is not a possibility and some lexical item is needed to provide the node with a value.)(8.8) abʊ

          ‘he hits him/her/it’       After constructing and decorating the propositional template, the lexical actions of
the verb leave the pointer on the external argument node as in (8.7).3 The metavariable
on this node can be resolved by indentifying the unﬁxed node and the external argument
node. This is done by the computational action of Unification, which allows two type-
identical nodes with compatible addresses and content to be brought together. The
unﬁxed node has a deﬁned formula value but an underspeciﬁed tree node address, while
the external argument node has a deﬁned position in the tree but an underspeciﬁed
formula value. Both are type e, so they may be Unified (8.9).","[172, 173]"

the syntactic gender of a lexeme and its semantic number, leading to some variation in
agreement behaviour. In (4.37), for example, laːlá, ‘boys’ is Masculine gender, but has
plural semantic number. Both masculine and plural agreement are attested.

           There were ten boys who lived in the same house. (Lit. some boys lived in one
           house, they were ten)                                                            (THIEF:1.1)The verb, ánná, shows Masculine agreement, agreeing with the syntactic gender of its
subject, laːlá. In the following clause where the subject is not overt (and through the
rest of the text) the verb shows Plural agreement, agreeing with the semantic number
of the noun’s referent. Note that there is no ‘Neuter’ noun to act as an antecedent
for the subject agreement marker on the second verb; in this case the agreement is
clearly with the plural number. Corbett (1991:225-260) describes nouns with this kind
of variable agreement as ‘hybrid’ nouns. He posits an agreement hierarchy according
to which certain types of agreeing morphemes (in Corbett’s terminology, ‘agreement
targets’) are more likely to agree with the syntactic gender of their controller, while
others are more likely to agree with its semantic gender. He also notes that,
         For any particular target type, the further it is removed from its controller,
         the greater the likelihood of semantic agreement (Corbett 1991:240).
It seems that something like this is what is happening in (4.37). The subject agreement
marker in the same clause as the hybrid noun agrees with its syntactic gender (Mascu-
line), while the subject agreement marker in the later clause agrees with its semantic
number (Plural).8
       There is potential confusion in naming this gender class Plural and for practical
reasons it may be that an alternative name would ideally be found. Nonetheless,
thinking of this gender class as plural ﬁts the agreement facts of Katcha and is logical.
Assuming with Corbett (1991:8) that ‘there is always a semantic core to the assignment
system’, (in other words, gender classes always have a semantic basis), the ‘semantic
core’ of the third gender is clearly purality. To name this gender class Plural is merely
an extension of the same class-naming convention which grammarians have followed for
the last two millenia: there are three gender classes in Katcha; animate males generally
belong to the ﬁrst class so we may refer to it as Masculine; animate females generally
belong to the second class, so we may refer to it as Feminine; animate plurals generally
belong to the third class, so we may refer to it as Plural.
   8
    It could be argued that masculinity is as salient a feature of a group of boys as plurality. I have
therefore stopped short of suggesting that in the case of laːlá, Plural is the word’s ‘semantic gender’,
though this would certainly ﬁt with Corbett’s hypothesis. It may be that the non-local agreement in
(4.37) is actually with number, rather than ‘semantic gender’. Nonetheless, it is clear that the local
agreement is with the word’s syntactic gender, while the more distant agreement is more semantically
based. In the case of i ́ːjá, ‘women’, whose syntactic gender is Plural, there is no such gender mis-match:
both local and non-local agreeing morphemes show plural agreement. It would be instructive to see
what happens in the case of a semantically singular noun with Plural syntactic gender, such as kanʈá,
‘spear’: local agreement is always with the syntactic gender (Plural) as expected, but I do not have
data on non-local agreement.

Katcha may be analysed as having a system of three genders, based around the features
of Masculine, Feminine and Plural. Such a system is typologically unusual, but it is
not totally unattested. Gender systems like this have been argued to exist in several
languages in North Eastern Africa. Interestingly, these languages are neither Niger-
Congo nor Nilo-Saharan (the two familes to which Kadu has been ascribed in the
past), but are from the Cushitic family of Afro-Asiatic:     In contrast to other languages that have three-way gender distinction sys-
     tems, this third value is not neuter in Cushitic. In terms of agreement, this
     third gender value requires the same agreement pattern as the third person
     plural. As a result, it is called “plural” gender in many studies of Cushitic
     languages (Tsegaye et al. 2013:191).","[80, 81, 82]"

often subject to shortening and/or lenition. The presence of the glottal stop in the 1sg,
2sg and 3m forms is notable as these are the only words in which the glottal stop is
attested as a consonant of the language. However, in non-emphatic contexts the glottal
stop is frequently dropped and the pronouns realised as /aː/, /ɔː/ and /ɪː/ (or even
shortened to /a/, etc). Similarly (though less frequently), the 2pl and 3p forms may
be realised as /a:/ or /e:/.1
      The pronominal forms in (6.1) are listed without reference to tone. The tone pattern
of core pronouns varies and it appears that this variation may be due to the pronoun’s
function in the sentence. That is, pronouns seem to be marked tonally for case. Where
the pronoun is the subject of its clause, it has a Low-Low melody, as in the second
clause of (6.2); where the pronoun is not the subject of its clause, it is more likely to

6.4.2 Additional prepositional phrases
When referring to body parts, Katcha uses a construction that looks very similar to
that used with locative adverbs (6.73-6.74). Indeed, because most locative adverbs
are derived from words for body parts, in some cases the lexical items are the same.
In (6.73), for example, the interpretation is ‘ants are crawling on my body’. As with
locative adverbs, the prepositional phrase gives a general location (‘on me’) which is
speciﬁed further by the subsequent prepositional phrase.(6.73) aːfʊ́ ʊ́rʊ́néːné k-ete          k-ɔːna

ing on my body’ (kɔːna meaning ‘on body’) and ‘ants are crawling all over me’ (kɔːna
meaning ‘all over’). A possible answer to this question may come from looking at
the tone melody of the locative pronoun. Before locative adverbs the pronoun carries
the usual tone melody, as given in the paradigm in (6.23, repeated below). But in the
context of (6.73), the tone melody of the locative pronoun appears to be diﬀerent (6.75).
It is not certain why this is, but it is certainly possible that it serves to diﬀerentiate
sentences like (6.73) where the general locative is further speciﬁed by an additional
prepositional phrase from those where it is further speciﬁed by an adverb.(6.75) locative preposition ká + personal pronouns, before k-ɔːna, ‘loc-body’

          3f        kɔ́nɔ́   Having now looked at the locative preposition ká in some detail, it can be seen
that it is a very general locative. It can be thought of as an essentially underspeciﬁed
locative relation. Where the precise relation can be established from context through
general pragmatic principles, ka on its own is suﬃcient. Elsewhere it requires to be
further speciﬁed, and this may be done through the use of locative adverbs or (at least
in the case of body parts) an additional locative phrase. This underspeciﬁcation means
that the locative preposition may be used in a wide range of contexts and is one of the
reasons ká is so ubiquitous in Katcha.
122                       Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and Prepositions6.5 Lexical speciﬁcation of prepositions
In section 6.2 it was noted that the line between case markers and adpositions is very
ﬁne, and that one way of distinguishing between them is to consider the question of
whether or not the form used is ‘imposed by the structure within which the noun
phrase occurs’ (Payne 1997:100). If we adopt this as a rule of thumb, the question
of optionality becomes key. In the majority of examples cited in this chapter there is
no obligation for a noun phrase to be marked with a particular morpheme, thus the
characterisation of them as prepositions rather than case markers. The use of these
prepositions seems to be primarily down to communicative intent.
   There are nonetheless a few verbs which require their complements to be headed
by particular prepositions. An obvious example is the ditransitive verb anáŋá, ‘give’
whose indirect object is marked by dative a. It was also argued in section 6.3.1 that cɔ,
‘go’, requires an object marked by dative a. In addition to these, a few verbs require
their object to be marked with locative ká, even though there does not seem to be any
locative interpretation (6.76-6.78).(6.76) anʊ ‘refuse’

closer inspection the majority of these appear to be constructions where the complement

it ‘not always easy to distinguish whether a noun or a verb has been used.’ (Stevenson
1941:104) But a number of the verbs Stevenson lists, which take ka before an inﬁnitive,
seem not to take ka when the object is unambiguously a noun. In such cases, the ka is
better thought of not as a preposition, but as a dependent clause marker.
   Overall, it seems that there are very few verbs which lexically determine the form
their complements must take. As such, there does not seem to be suﬃcient evidence to
describe these morphemes as case markers.","[139, 140, 141, 142]"
"5.5.1 Relatives
Given the analysis of já/mɔ́/nɔ́ as a demonstrative pronoun, it might be assumed that
in a relative clause it would play the role of a relative pronoun. From a typological point
of view, this would be distinctly surprising. Cross-linguistically, relative pronouns are
an uncommon way of encoding relativization, and are largely non-existent in Africa.
Of the 166 languages whose subject-relativization strategies are surveyed in WALS
(Comrie and Kuteva 2013a), only 12 make use of relative pronouns. Of those, 11 are
European languages and the twelfth is North American. Furthermore, the majority of
relative pronouns are derived from interrogative morphemes; it is extremely rare for a
demonstrative to be the source of a relative pronoun. This contrasts with the case of
invariant relative complementizers, which often derive from demonstratives (de Vries
2002; Gisborne and Truswell 2016). A demonstrative pronoun acting as a relative
pronoun is therefore not something we would expect to ﬁnd in Katcha.
     In fact, there are ways in which the demonstrative head of a relative clause in Katcha
does not act as a classic relative pronoun. The deﬁnition of the ‘relative pronoun
strategy’ used in WALS is that ‘the position relativized is indicated inside the relative
clause by means of a clause-initial pronominal element, and this pronominal element
is case-marked (by case or by an adposition) to indicate the role of the head noun
within the relative clause’ (Comrie and Kuteva 2013a). This is contrasted with the
‘gap strategy’ where ‘there is no overt case-marked reference to the head noun within
the relative clause’ (Comrie and Kuteva 2013a). Case-marking is therefore central to
Comrie and Kuteva’s deﬁnition. In section 6.6, it will be suggested that case on Katcha
pronouns may be indicated by tone. Since the tone on the demonstrative morpheme
appears to remain consistently high, this suggests that there is no case marking. So by
this deﬁnition, Katcha uses a ‘gap strategy’ for subject relatives, as would be expected
given its genetic and geographical location. Also, note that non-subject relative clauses
often utilise a resumptive pronoun (section 5.3). The internal syntax of non-subject
relatives is yet to be investigated (pending a study of dependent and non-ﬁnite clauses),
but a couple of implications can be drawn from this fact. Firstly, as with the gap
strategy for subject relatives, a resumptive strategy for non-subject relatives is not
out of place genetically or geographically (Comrie and Kuteva 2013b). Secondly, the
5.5. Cross-linguistic connections                                                        89presence of a resumptive implies that it is this rather than the demonstrative which
encodes ‘the syntactic-semantic role of the head noun in the relative clause’ (Comrie and
Kuteva 2013c). By these deﬁnitions then, the demonstrative is not a relative pronoun
in the classic sense.
   A better characterisation of the role of the demonstrative in Katcha relative clauses
is that it is a ‘relative marker’ (RM) in the sense described by de Vries (2002). Following
Lehman (1984), de Vries argues that there are three possible functions of a relative
element: Subordination, Attribution and Gap Construction (de Vries 2002:155), and
that an RM is a ‘type of relative particle that has just the Attribution function’ (de Vries
2002:170). That is, an RM encodes the fact that the relative clause is attributed to
the head. There are four distinctive characteristics of relative markers, all of which are
true for Katcha (de Vries 2002:174-176): i) RMs are attested only in post-nominal relative clauses. ii) RMs occupy the ﬁrst position in the relative clause.iii) RMs show at least some overt evidence of agreement with the head noun.iv) RMs are predominantly found in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages.","[107, 108]"

7.3 Applicative
The applicative suﬃxes correspond to Stevenson’s ‘dative action’ (Stevenson 1941:112).
Stevenson gives only one suﬃx under this heading, -tV, and my data concurs with his
insofar as the most common applicative suﬃx in my data is -tá (7.28b-7.29b). However,
some verbs take the suﬃx -nV̂, which appears to perform the same function (7.30b-
7.31b). The distinction between -tá and -nV̂ would appear to be a lexical property of
the verb rather than any semantic property of the aﬃx.(7.28) a. akká         m-ʊnɪ       kʊ́rɪ

142                                  Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Verb ExtensionsThe additional argument introduced by the applicative-marked verb follows the direct
object (where there is one). It is preceded by the dative preposition a, which marks
it as an oblique argument rather than a core argument of the verb. Assuming that
‘applicative’ is deﬁned as ‘a valence increasing operation that brings a peripheral par-
ticipant onto center stage by making it into a direct object’ (Payne 1997:186, emphasis
mine), this means that the -tá/-nV̂ suﬃx does not strictly speaking mark applicative,
but dative. Its function is still to license the presence of an extra argument beyond
those required by the semantics of the verb (in contrast to ditransitive verbs such as
anáŋːá ‘give’ which require no such suﬃx). But rather than licensing the presence of
a direct object, the suﬃx licenses the presence of a dative object. A further typical
feature of applicatives which is lacking in Katcha is an alternation between applicative
and non-applicative (eg adpositional) constructions. In Katcha there is no preposition
that can be used with non-applicative verbs to mark benefactive. The only way to
express a benefactive meaning is with the applicative construction. Languages do exist
where the use of applicative constructions are obligatory, but it is more prototypical
for applicatives to be optional (Peterson 2006:45-51). So this is another way in which
Katcha does not exhibit prototypical applicatives. Nonetheless, I retain the use of the
term ‘applicative’ for now since this is a widely used term for a morpheme on a verb
which licenses the presence of an extra argument. The diﬀerence in the Katcha case is
that the morpheme licenses an oblique, rather than core, argument.
    The applicative form of a transitive verb does not appear to be aﬀected by the
presence or absence of an object. There is no diﬀerence between the morphology of the
verb in (7.31b), where the direct object is present and that in (7.32), where there is no
direct object.(7.32) omuɗi uruɓú-nû         a    kʊ́kkʊ
        man    3m.build-appl dat Kuku
        ‘the man is building for Kuku’One explanation of this is simply to note that as a ‘pro-drop’ language transitive
verbs in Katcha do not require an overt object. Thus it may be the form in (7.32)
is transitive, with an implied object; it would perhaps be better glossed as ‘the man
is building it/something for Kuku’. The existence of examples such as (7.32) does not
therefore preclude the existence of verbs which are both antipassive and applicative.
The fact there are no clearly attested examples may simply be a matter of frequency and
plausibility: the antipassive and the applicative are to some extent mutually exclusive.
The antipassive is used to express situations in which there is no theme or patient and
which are therefore quite general; the applicative is used to express situations in which
there is a goal or a beneﬁciary and which are therefore much more likely to involve
actions that are quite speciﬁc. It is not surprising that the two forms are seldom, if
7.3. Applicative                                                                      143ever, found together.
      An alternative explanation is to note that there are two lexically-conditioned ap-
plicative suﬃxes, one of which displays vowel harmony with the root. As was speculated
for the antipassive, this may be an indication that applicative verbs are lexicalised. If
so, we would not expect to see an antipassive ‘suﬃx’ and an applicative ‘suﬃx’ on the
same verb: both form part of the stem and are in the same ‘slot’.
      The idea that the applicative may be lexicalised is supported by the existence of
a couple of apparently irregular suﬃxes. The suﬃx -nVkV occurs with the verb ʊmʊ
‘hold’ (7.33).8 It is unclear whether this is an irregular applicative morpheme; it may be
a combination of Applicative -nV̂ with some additional morpheme. No other examples
of this suﬃx have been found.(7.33) a. omuɗi ʊmʊ              kanʈa
               man     3m.hold k.o.spear
               ‘the man is carrying a spear’

               man     3m.hold-appl k.o.spear ben Kuku
               ‘the man is carrying a spear for Kuku’Another apparently unique suﬃx is the -nɔta Applicative suﬃx which occurs only with
the verb ɪjɔ ‘wash’ (Tuna dialect) (7.34). In this case there is a plausible diachronic
explanation. In the larger ‘Katcha proper’ dialect, a diﬀerent verb is used: ɔkɔnɔ, which
takes the regular -ta applicative suﬃx (7.35). It seems probable that the irregular suﬃx
in (7.34b) is a borrowing and reanalysis of the ﬁnal two syllables of the verb in (7.35b),
i.e. the ﬁnal syllable of the root used in the Katcha dialect area has been taken along
with the regular -tá suﬃx and reanalysed to create an irregular suﬃx.9(7.34) a. akka          m-ɪjɔ     enɗɗɪ                                    [Tuna dialect]

"6.1.1 Pronoun Set 1 - ‘Core’ pronouns
The primary function of the ﬁrst set of pronouns is to express the core arguments of a
sentence: the subject and the direct object (i.e. argument roles S, A and P). For this
reason, this set may be referred to as the Core pronouns. However as will be seen in
section 6.2, these forms also appear with certain prepositions, so they do also express
some peripheral arguments.
      There are eight forms of the core pronouns, listed in (6.1). The 1st and 2nd person
pronouns distinguish singular and plural, while in the case of 1st person plural there is
a further distinction according to the inclusion or exclusion of the addressee. There are
three 3rd person pronouns, distinguishing grammatical gender (Masculine, Feminine
and Plural gender).",[115]

       ants 3m.crawl loc-1sg loc-body
       ‘ants are crawling on my body’   In a sentence like (9.1), it is not necessarily obvious whether the locative phrase kete
kɔːna describes the location of the ants or the location of the event of their crawling. In
other words, this phrase might be thought of as modifying an individual or it might be
thought of as modiﬁying an event. From a formal point of view, this distinction does
not matter a great deal since both individuals and events project type e terms. A phrase
such as on my body can be thought of as supplying an additional proposition which is
‘intersective’ in that it shares an argument with the matrix proposition. Whether the
shared argument is an event term or an individual term does not make much diﬀerence
to the process of building the propositional tree.
    In Dynamic Syntax, the formal tool used for modelling the connection between
propositions is the LINK relation. A LINK is the relation that holds between two
semantic trees which share some content. It is generally interpreted as a conjunction of
the values of the LINKed nodes. In the case of event-modifying prepositional phrases,
the LINK will hold between the situation argument of the matrix tree and the root
node of a LINKed tree that expresses an additional proposition about that situation.
This formal apparatus, a proposition LINKed to a term, is standardly used in DS
to model relative clauses. This is hardly surprising, given that a relative clause also
represents an additional proposition about some argument of the matrix proposition.
A PP adjunct modifying an argument is essentially a ‘small’ relative clause. To see how

an interpretation where the prepositional phrase modiﬁes the event (though as noted
above, the implementation works in much the same way for an analysis in which the
PP modiﬁes the subject argument).
       The processing of (9.1) begins with the parsing of the sentential subject and verb,
the lexical actions of the verb leaving the pointer on the situation argument node as in
(9.2).1,2(9.2) Parsing aːfʊ ʊrʊneːne                                            ?T y(t)

       The string aːfʊ ʊrʊneːne forms a fully grammatical sentence; if there were no
additional lexical material, the pointer would move to the logical subject node to resolve
the metavariable by unification with the unﬁxed node and the tree could compile
to give a fully speciﬁed proposition. But with the pointer at the event argument
node, there is nothing to stop this node being developed further. This can be done
using the computational action of LINK Introduction (Kempson et al. 2001:113;
Cann et al. 2005:88). This rule constructs a LINK relation from a type e node to
an open propositional node (a node with a requirement for type t). It also adds a
modal requirement ?⟨↓∗ ⟩(F o(si ), T y(es )), which requires that somewhere below (i.e. in
the LINKed tree) should be a copy of the node at the head of the LINK (9.3).
   1
      The assumption that the lexical actions of the verb leave the pointer on the situation argument
node is an adjustment to the account given in chapter 8 where it was assumed that the lexical actions
of the verb left the pointer on the logical subject node. This does not aﬀect the analyses given there,
merely adding an additional step of pointer movement from the situation argument node to the logical
subject node.
    2
      Cann (In prep.) argues that, like other type e terms, event arguments should be construed as epsilon
terms. In the formulae given in this section the internal structure of terms, including event variables,
is suppressed for notational clarity. The interpretation of PP adjuncts given here is a non-restrictive
one and so does not need to make reference to the internal structure of the epsilon-term.

sition, that is, the preposition deﬁnes a relationship (in this case locative) between its
complement and the event it modiﬁes. The lexical entry for locative ka is given in (9.4).
It checks that the pointer is at an open LINKed propositional node, that is, a node
which requires type t and is connected by a LINK to a completed type e node. The
actions then construct a predicate-argument structure, decorating the predicate node
with a two place locative relation (loc ′ ), decorating the external argument node with
a copy of the node at the head of the LINK (in this case, the situation variable si ), and
leaving the pointer on the open internal argument node. Executing these actions leads
to the partial tree in (9.5).","[201, 202, 203]"
"7.2.5 Summary of Valency-Reducing Verb Extensions
It is worth considering at this point how the various valency-reducing VEs might be
related. One obvious possibility which raises itself is that the Middle Voice -ncaːna
might in fact be Unaccusative -nca followed by Antipassive -VnV. This certainly looks
plausible from the form of the suﬃxes. However, it is perhaps somewhat counterin-
tuitive to think that for a verb expressing a dynamic event, such as ‘break’, the focus
might be placed on the resulting state by the addition of a suﬃx (-nca) and then put
back onto the event itself by the addition of a further suﬃx (-VnV).
      Stevenson does not make any mention of a middle suﬃx. He does make a claim that
the antipassive suﬃxes ‘sometimes intensify the meaning of the parent verb’ (Stevenson
1941:112) so it seems likely that he would analyse (7.24-26) as an unaccusative verb
with an intensity marker. However, I am not convinced by this. There are examples in
the draft Katcha New Testament where it seems unlikely that the interpretation would
be intensive. And Stevenson’s presentation of the data on this matter is somewhat
opaque. He does not make clear whether an ‘intensifying’ morpheme suﬃxed to a
transitive verb also causes it to become intransitive, for example. So I remain of the
opinion that -ncaːna, whether one morpheme or two, marks middle voice.7
      Evidence that -ncaːna should not be treated as a sequence of Unaccusative -nca
followed by Antipassive -VnV comes from the fact that the Antipassive appears to be
  7
    But see section 8.5 for a surprising but fascinating possible correlation between middle voice and
intensity.

the vowel in the Antipassive suﬃx varies according to the vowels in the verb root but
the other VE suﬃxes show no such vowel harmony. The Antipassive has two forms,
the choice of which is lexically determined, whereas the other valency-reducing VEs
each have only one form (which is generally quite productive). Finally, it was noted
in section 7.2.3 that in some cases the Unaccusative suﬃx appears to attach to an
Antipassive stem (as in example 7.22b). It may be then, that the Antipassive is more
lexicalised than the other suﬃxes.
   Nonetheless, the Antipassive does ﬁt into the system of Katcha valency-reducing
VEs, which may be organised according to two features, as summarised in table 7.1.
   Firstly, there is the thematic role played by the syntactic subject. When the verb
has the Active (unmarked) form or the Antipassive form, the most agent-like participant
is the syntactic subject. When the verb has the Passive, Unaccusative or Middle Voice
forms, the most patient-like participant is the syntactic subject.
   The second feature denoted by these verb extensions is the number of arguments
expressed.   Katcha is pro-drop, so any semantic argument may be phonologically
unrealised. However, the Active (unmarked) form and the Passive form of the verb
each take two semantic arguments. Note that while the Passive reduces the verb’s
syntactic valency by demoting the Agent to the status of a (usually implied) oblique
argument, the semantic valency is unchanged: there exists both an Agent and a Patient,
even if the Agent is only there by implication. This contrasts with the other forms,
the Antipassive, Unaccusative and Middle Voice, each of which take only one semantic
argument.
   In section 7.2.3 it was noted that there are morphological and semantic connections
between the Antipassive and the Unaccusative, while in section 7.2.4 it was noted that
there are phonological, syntactic and semantic connections between the Unaccusative
and the Middle Voice. Looking at table 7.1, these correlations are not at all surprising:
there is a clear functional similarity between these three suﬃxes. All of them mark the
verb as having not only reduced syntactic valency, but also reduced semantic valency

3.4 Tone
The majority of research that has been done on Kadu languages, even phonological
research, has ignored the issue of tone. ‘All Kadu languages are almost certainly
tone languages… but the data are insuﬃcient to analyse the various tonal systems’
(Schadeberg 1994:18). The only published paper with any attempt to analyse tonal
behaviour is Hall (2006) for Kamda.
   It seems likely that there are two underlying level tones in Katcha. Hall (2006:178-
179) states that Mid tone exists phonetically in Kamda, but has some discussion on it
and notes some evidence for it being an allotone of High (it only occurs word ﬁnally,
for example), though its status remains unclear. Schadeberg (1994:18) ‘more or less
uncritically assumed a two tone system’ with occasional downstep. He also notes that
‘Falling tones are rare, and rising tones even more so’ (Schadeberg 1994:18). Both
30                                                             Preliminaries: PhonologySchadeberg (1994) and Hall and Hall (2004) cite Reh (1985) as describing Krongo as
having a two-tone system, and though Schadeberg cites Matsushita (1984) as ﬁnding
a three-tone system in Kadugli, he points out that Matushita’s Mid tone is rarer than
High or Low. In my observation, there are few if any examples of three-way tone
contrasts.
     There are few lexical items which distinguished solely by tone, though there are
some functional words where this is the case. For example, the locative preposition ká
has high tone, while the dependent clause marker ka has low tone.
     The main use of tone seems to be grammatical. This seems to be true for Kadu as a
whole: ‘[The] most frequent use of tone and/or stress to distinguish between otherwise
similar words is grammatical, diﬀerentiating between diﬀerent forms of the verb’ (Hall
and Hall 2004:7). In chapter 6 the possibility is discussed that tone distinctions are used
to mark case in Katcha, at least on pronouns. Tone is also used to distinguish between
certain verb aspects (parallel versus antecedent events), though these fall outwith the
scope of the current study.
     Hall and Hall (2004) also suggest a possible connection between tone and stress:
‘It has also been noted that heightened tone and loudness have a strong tendency to
co-occur’ (Hall and Hall 2004:7). This is true for Katcha, certainly on a phrasal level.
It is my impression that there is usually one syllable per ‘intonational domain’ which
carries a higher tone and is louder than all others. This syllable appears to be the most
stressed or focussed within the phrase. I leave open the question of what constitutes an
‘intonational domain’ and what role the focussed syllable has within it, but in chapter
5 it is noted that this kind of phenomenon seems to be intonational, associated with a
pause or with contrast.
     Hall (2006:179) observes for Kamda that a ‘signiﬁcant amount of pitch conditioning
is evident.’ He lists a number of Kamda constructions in which the tones of the noun
are changed by the presence of a particular particle or aﬃx. This is also something
that occurs in Katcha. Some conditioning is easy to account for, such as the fact
that the normally low tone on the ﬁrst syllable of an oblique pronoun becomes high
following the high tone locative preposition (section 6.2.2). Other conditioning is much
more complex, so I have attempted to mark the surface form of tone as accurately as
possible throughout this study. As noted above though, vowels are frequently elided in
Katcha; in these cases I have marked the underlying tone (and indeed, the underlying
vowel) where it is known.
3.5. Orthographic conventions used in this study                                       313.5 Orthographic conventions used in this study
In general, I have tried to adopt a conservative but morphophonemic transcription,
making as few analytical decisions as possible while still maintaining morphophonemic
transparency.
   Novel data in this study is transcribed using the IPA symbols in (3.1-3.2), with the
exception of the dental plosive phoneme, which is transcribed as <t>, and the front
mid-height vowel phoneme, which is transcribed as <e>.
   High tone is marked with an acute accent <á> and falling tone with a circumﬂex
<â>. Low tone is unmarked. As noted in section 3.4, I have attempted to mark
the surface form of tone wherever possible throughout this study. As noted above
though, vowels are frequently elided in Katcha; in these cases I have transcribed the
underlying tone (and indeed, the underlying vowel) where it is known. Note that where
examples are taken from written sources they are transcribed without tone (the source
is acknowledged in all such cases).
   ‘Long’ plosives and implosives are unambiguously geminates and so are transcribed
with a double consonant <kk>. Long nasals, glides and vowels are more ambiguous as
to their status and so are marked as long <aː> unless they can be clearly analysed as
belonging to two separate morphemes, in which case a morpheme boundary is marked
<a-a>.
   All Katcha and IPA data is set using haris         font. When phonemic, phonetic or
orthographic forms speciﬁcally are being refered to in the text, the appropriate brackets
are used and the text is upright. In other cases, quoted linguistic forms are written in
italic without brackets.
    Unless speciﬁcally illustrating phonetic processes such as ﬁnal vowel elision, the
full citation form of morphemes is given in interlinear examples. For example, the
instrumental preposition ana is usually realised as [a] before a consonant and [an] before
a vowel, but is transcribed as <ana> (with relevant tones) in interlinear morphemic
glossing.
    Where data examples are taken from written sources, the original orthography is
given verbatim and then transliterated to match the above orthographic conventions
(without adding tones). In the case of data quoted from Stevenson (1941, 1956-57),
he standardly gives a free (though relatively literal) English translation, but does
not give morpheme breaks or glosses. When quoting his data, I therefore quote the
example verbatim, give my own interlinear morphemic gloss, and give Stevenson’s free
translation. Thus in examples such as (3.3), the ﬁrst and ﬁnal lines are Stevenson’s,
while the intervening lines are mine. Likewise, with examples taken from the draft
Katcha New Testament, the text is ﬁrst given verbatim, then my morphemic gloss, then

Chapter 4Number and GenderIntroduction
Katcha has an interaction between the categories of Number and Gender which is typo-
logically unusual. It is also relevant to the wider debate about the genetic aﬃliation of
the Kadu family because the number and gender systems display properties reminiscent
of both Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan languages. The interaction between number
and gender also shows properties which are very rare, but which have been argued
to exist in certain Afro-Asiatic languages. This is something of a surprise; with the
partial exception of Blench (2006), no previous research has suggested a relationship
between Kadu and the Afro-Asiatic phylum. Whilst typological similarities alone do
not constitute deﬁnitive proof that a language belongs to a particular phylum, they
certainly should be considered seriously. The existence of shared typological phenomena
in two languages may be evidence of a diachronic connection (Bickel 2007, 2011). In
any case, it is notable that the phenomena described in this chapter reﬂect the general
state of confusion over the lineage of Katcha. Given the complexity of the data, it is
not surprising that diﬀerent researchers have interpreted them diﬀerently. There is a
general correlation between the way the morphosyntactic facts have been interpreted
and the assumptions about the language’s genetic aﬃliation prevalent at the time.
Thus, following Greenberg’s (1950) classiﬁcation of the Kadu languages as Kordofanian,
older studies of Katcha (Stevenson 1956-57; Tucker and Bryan 1966) attempted to
demonstrate Niger-Congo-style semantically based noun classes based on the number
preﬁxes. Following Schadeberg’s (1981) questioning of this assumption, more recent
work (Dimmendaal 2000; Gilley 2013) has sought to demonstrate that Katcha displays
a tripartite system more typical of Nilo-Saharan. This chapter will demonstrate that
there are elements of both of these systems present in the Katcha number system,
before going on to demonstrate that certain features of the gender system, such as the
notion of ‘polarity’ and its interaction with number, are more similar to those found in
                                           35
36                                     Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Number and GenderAfro-Asiatic.
       The chapter begins with a discussion of number marking in section 4.1. Number
is marked on Katcha nouns by a variety of plurative and singulative aﬃxes. A very
welcome recent development in this area has been the publication of Leoma Gilley’s
paper on noun morphology in Katcha (Gilley 2013). This is a comprehensive and
systematic presentation of data on Katcha nouns, focusing on the number-marking
aﬃxes.      Gilley’s data, which was collected from Katcha speakers in Khartoum in
2006–2007, matches my own quite closely. In section 4.1 below, I therefore present
some representative nouns of each type and mention where my data diverges from
Gilley’s, but for further examples the interested reader may refer to Gilley’s paper.
       The gender system is then described in section 4.2. The main focus of this section is
to establish the number of gender classes in Katcha; there are three classes of agreement
in Katcha but previous work has been inconsistent as to whether these represent three
gender values, or only two genders plus plural number agreement. The argument
is made that there are three values of gender. It is demonstrated that these are
semantically based on biological gender and so they are described – temporarily –
as masculine, feminine and neuter.
       Having described number marking and gender classiﬁcation, the discussion moves
on to the interaction between these two categories. There are two senses in which
number and gender interact in Katcha. Firstly, there is a relationship between the
number-marking preﬁx and the gender of the noun. This is discussed in section 4.3
where it is shown that (for morphologically number-marked nouns) the aﬃx, rather
than the noun root, assigns gender to the noun. This can result in ‘gender polarity’
where the gender of the noun changes when its number changes. Secondly, there is an
intimate connection between the third gender class and the concept of plurality. This
is discussed in section 4.4. It is argued that rather than neuter, the semantic basis of
the third gender category might be better described as plural.1 The incorporation of
plural as a value of the gender system is a phenomenon that has been described (and
argued about) in the literature on Cushitic, but has to my knowledge never before been
recorded outwith that language family.
       The place of this chapter within the study as a whole is largely to provide back-
ground information. The focus in this chapter is primarily morphological: to establish
the number and nature of gender classes. An understanding of the gender system,
and to a lesser extent the number system, is foundational to understanding Katcha
nominals. However, it is not the main focus of the descriptive and theoretical analyses
in the rest of the thesis, which focus on syntax and semantics. I assume that phonology
and morphology play a part in establishing the input to syntax, but I am relaxed about
   1
     Sets may also be thought of as neuter, at least in terms of natural gender distinctions, but plurality
is the more important feature in Katcha.

assume a transparent analytic morphology for multimorphemic words on the basis that
this best satisﬁes Occam’s razor.2 For this reason the descriptive analyses in part II
largely focus on establishing the function of individual morphemes and the theoretical
analyses in part III on deﬁning their formal semantics. I assume that evidence in
favour of taking an alternative, more lexical position in any particular case will largely
come from morphophonology (Kaye 1989, 1995). Since this study has little to say
on phonology, I remain open minded about the best morphological analysis in any
given instance and in places I consider analyses based on an alternative morphological
characterisation.3,4
4.1 Number
Number is marked on Katcha nouns by plurative and singulative aﬃxes. Most of
these are preﬁxes, and they are relatively numerous. In some cases, singulative and
plurative preﬁxes occur in pairs, and in a subset of these, it is possible to see a semantic
connection between the nouns they inﬂect. In this way, Katcha nouns superﬁcially
resemble Kordofanian nouns with their noun-class preﬁxes and Stevenson (1941, 1956-
57) frames his presentation of nouns in these terms. Stevenson does note two important
caveats: ﬁrstly, that the agreement system in Katcha is quite diﬀerent to those found
in the Kordofanian languages (this is discussed in section 4.2), and secondly, that ‘most
of the noun classes possess either a singular or a plural preﬁx, but not both’ (Stevenson
1941:26).
       More recent work (Dimmendaal 2000; Gilley 2013) has argued that Katcha displays
a system more typical of Nilo-Saharan nouns: a tripartite system consisting of ‘singu-
lative marking, plural marking, and a replacement pattern’ (Dimmendaal 2000:214).
That is to say, there are nouns whose plural form is unmarked and whose singular is
marked morphologically; there are nouns where the unmarked form is the singular and
it is the plural form which is morphologically marked; ﬁnally, there are nouns where
both singular and plural carry morphological inﬂection. Diverging from Dimmendaal’s
terminology slightly, I refer to morphology of the ﬁrst type as singulative, to the second
type as plurative and to the third type as replacive. To avoid ambiguity, when referring
to the number of the referent, I use the terms semantically singular or semantically
plural.
   2
      We need a syntax to combine linguistic units anyway, so all things being equal we may as well use
it rather than have a separate set of morphological operations.
    3
      For example, see the discussion in section 9.5 of whether verbs carrying an applicative suﬃx should
be analysed as lexical items or analytically.
    4
      The approach to morphology summarized here is in line with the general assumptions of Dynamic
Syntax. DS takes linguistic formatives as projecting semantic instructions to the computation, but is
not exercised about whether those formatives are words or morphemes.
38                                  Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Number and Gender     Gilley’s (2013) choice of presentation method is particularly interesting with regard
to the Niger-Congo/Nilo-Saharan debate. She follows Dimmendaal (2000) in arguing
quite strongly that Katcha does indeed follow a Nilo-Saharan-style tripartite num-
ber marking system, but at the same time groups nouns into classes according to
their singulative/plurative-aﬃx pairs (allowing for one member of the pair to be zero-
marked). She therefore follows Stevenson in suggesting that there is a ∅-/nV- class, a
∅-/kV- class, a t-/∅- class, etc.
     In this section, the organization of the data focuses on the individual aﬃxes rather
than on any patterns that can be drawn from their pairings. This is because, as will be
seen below, there is a fair amount of ‘mix-and-matching’ when it comes to the replacive
nouns (those inﬂecting with both a singulative and a plurative preﬁx). Also, it will be
shown in section 4.3 that it is the individual aﬃxes which are relevant to agreement
in Katcha, and not the aﬃx-pair ‘classes’. The plurative aﬃxes are introduced ﬁrst,
followed by the singulative aﬃxes and then the replacive aﬃxes.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]"

                                  Abstract
This thesis presents a new description and theoretical analysis of the nominal system
of Katcha (Nilo-Saharan, Kadu), spoken in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan.              The
description and analysis are based on a synthesis of data from several sources, including
unpublished archive material and original ﬁeldwork. The study is placed in context with
a discussion of the demographic, cultural and political background aﬀecting the Katcha
linguistic community, a review of the current state of linguistic research on Katcha and
a discussion of the ongoing controversy over the place of the Kadu languages within
the language phyla of Africa.
   The morphosyntactic descriptions ﬁrst focus on the role of nominals as heads,
considering phenomena such as classiﬁcation, agreement and modiﬁcation. It is shown
that Katcha has a unusual system of gender agreement with three agreement classes
based on the concepts of Masculine, Feminine and Plural and that the gender of a noun
may change between its singular and plural forms. Surprisingly, these phenomena
are both most commonly found in Afro-Asiatic, which is not a phylum to which
Kadu has previously been ascribed. The gender changes are shown to be predictable,
determined by number-marking aﬃxes. The study then gives a uniﬁed analysis of
various types of nominal modiﬁers; relative clauses, possessives, demonstratives and
adjectives all display similar morphological properties and this is accounted for by
analysing all modﬁers as appositional, headed by a demonstrative pronoun.           This
analysis of modiﬁers shows them to be related to, though not the same as, the notions
of relative markers and construct state found widely in African languages.
   The role of nominals within sentential argument structure is then considered, with
discussion of phenomena such as prepositional phrases, case and verbal valency. From
the interaction of prepositions and pronouns, it is tentatively concluded that Katcha has
three cases: Nominative, Accusative and Oblique. From the interaction of verbs and
nouns, it is demonstrated that the verbal suﬃxes known as ‘verb extensions’ primarily
serve to license the absence of otherwise mandatory core arguments.
   The second part of the thesis provides a theoretical analysis of the nominal system
within the framework of Dynamic Syntax (DS). Two key features of the DS formalism
come into play. Firstly, DS construes semantic individuals as terms of the epsilon
calculus. Verb extensions are analysed as projecting context-dependent epsilon terms,
providing a value for the ‘missing’ argument. Secondly, DS allows information sharing
between propositions by means of a ‘LINK’ relation. Prepositional phrases are analysed
as projecting a subordinate proposition which shares an argument with the matrix tree.
                                           v
These two formal tools come together in the analysis of nominal modiﬁers, which are
construed as projecting an arbitrarily complex epsilon term LINKed to some term in
the matrix tree, directly reﬂecting their descriptive analysis as appositional nominals.
   In presenting new data for a little studied language, this thesis adds to our knowl-
edge and understanding of Nuba Mountain languages. In describing and analysing
some of the typologically unsual features of Katcha’s nominal system, it challenges
some standard assumptions about these constructions and about the genetic aﬃliation
of the Kadu family. And in the theoretical analysis it demonstrates the suitability of
Dynamic Syntax to model some of the key insights of the descriptive analysis.

Now I know what the Teacher was getting at. There’s no way I could have got to
submitting a thesis without the help of a cast of thousands. Some of them are people
who helped me with my research and study-related things, without whom I could never
have completed this. Others are people who helped me by dragging me away from my
research and study-related things, thereby keeping me sane (relatively speaking). And
a few people, remarkably, did both.
   Top of the list in the ﬁrst category must be my supervisors Professor Ronnie Cann,
and Dr Bert Remijsen. But there have also been academics, staﬀ and fellow students
in universities on three continents: members of the Meaning and Grammar Research
Group at the University of Edinburgh; Professor Christopher Ehret and the staﬀ at
the Young Research Library at UCLA for helping me access the Stevenson archive; and
the Department of Linguistics at the University of Khartoum, especially Dr Maha and
Dr Abeer, for linguistic feedback, arranging all the visa admin, and many many cups
of tea. In Sudan there were also many people who helped me with data collection. My
heartfelt gratitude goes to my main language helpers Tito and Musa, who travelled
over an hour each way to try and explain their language to this stupid naive Westerner.
Also to the Katcha team, linguists and translation consultants at ECS, especially Dr
Russell Norton, who was not merely a helpful linguist with years of Nuba language
experience: to me and my family, he, Katharine and Lowenna were neighbours, tour
guides, translators, playmates, babysitters, cultural conﬁdantes, fellow homeschoolers,
and most importantly, friends.
   In the second category is virtually the whole population of Sudan. They have a
saying: ‘If you took the 100 nicest people in the world and put them in a room together,
99 of them would be Sudanese!’ I think we met all 99: landlords, neighbours, shop-
keepers, taxi drivers, passers-by; all desperate to show us hospitality. At home, Maggie
and Cameron, providers of my Edinburgh crash pad, made sure there was something
delicious waiting in the fridge for when I rolled in at midnight. Our friends and family
in Scotland, USA and Sudan have been there when we needed them, especially our
friends at Queens Park Baptist Church in Glasgow and Khartoum Christian Centre.

1.2 Morphosyntactic Descriptions
The language description focuses on the nominal system. The ﬁrst half, chapters 4 and
5, focuses on the role of nominals as heads, considering phenomena such as classiﬁcation,
agreement and modiﬁcation. The second half, chapters 6 and 7, focuses on nominals as
dependents and arguments, considering phenomena such as prepositional phrases, case
and verbal valency.
    Chapter 4 describes nominal classiﬁcation in Katcha. Katcha has an interaction
between the categories of Number and Gender which is typologically unusual and is
also relevant to the wider debate about the genetic aﬃliation of the Kadu family.
The chapter begins with a discussion of number marking, presenting the variety of
singulative and plurative preﬁxes with which number is marked on Katcha nouns. It is
1.2. Morphosyntactic Descriptions                                                      5demonstrated that these show the typically Nilo-Saharan characteristic of occuring in
a tripartite distribution, where some nouns take plurative aﬃxes, some take singulative
aﬃxes and some take both. However, it is also demonstrated that among the third
group are nouns which show the typically Niger-Congo characteristic of occuring in
classes which have a semantic basis and are indicated morphologically by their number
aﬃxes. Following the discussion of number is a discussion of gender, which establishes
that agreement in Katcha is based on three gender classes, and not on two gender
classes plus plural number as has sometimes been suggested. Having described number
marking and gender classiﬁcation, the discussion moves on to the interaction between
these two categories. It is shown that for morphologically number-marked nouns the
aﬃx, rather than the noun root, assigns gender to the noun. This can result in ‘polarity’
where the gender of a noun in the singular may be diﬀerent from its gender in the
plural. Interestingly, polarity is most commonly found in Afro-Asiatic, meaning that
the number system shows some properties of all three North-East African language
phyla. Finally, this chapter argues that the semantic basis of the third gender class is
the notion of plurality and that Katcha is best described as having a three-class gender
system of Masculine, Feminine and Plural. Such systems have been argued to exist in
some Cushitic languages, but to my knowledge this is the ﬁrst time it has ever been
recorded outwith that language family.
   Chapter 5 presents a description and uniﬁed analysis of Katcha nominal modiﬁers, of
which there are three main types: demonstratives, possessors and relative clauses. It is
noted that in each case, nominal modiﬁers display gender agreement with the modiﬁed
noun, carry morphological marking when the modiﬁed noun is a peripheral argument
of the verb, and occur in ‘headless’ constructions where there is no overt noun to be
modiﬁed (in which case they have a pronominal interpretation). It is then argued that
nominal modiﬁers are all demonstrative pronouns, or phrases headed by demonstrative
pronouns, which are appositional to the modiﬁed noun. With the exception of the
medial and distal demonstratives, all modiﬁers are introduced by morphemes of a
similar form. Phonological evidence is presented that suggests that these occur in
complementary distribution and are therefore allomorphs. It is then argued that this
modifying morpheme is the proximal demonstrative pronoun, allowing the incorpo-
ration of the medial and distal demonstratives into the same system and explaining
why the latter have a diﬀerent form, but identical distribution to all other nominal
modiﬁers. This chapter ﬁnishes with some cross-linguistic perspective by discussing
the relationship between the analysis of Katcha outlined here and two notions which
have been argued to be appropriate to a number of African languages: the ‘relative
marker’ and the ‘construct state’. It is suggested that both of these typically African
constructions may result from grammaticalization of the demonstrative pronoun which
heads the nominal modiﬁer.
6                                                           Preliminaries: Introduction    Chapter 6 describes personal pronouns in Katcha and aims to explain the diﬀerences
between the various forms. There are two basic sets of pronominal forms: ‘core’
pronouns and ‘oblique’ pronouns. The choice of pronominal form is dependent on
its role in the sentence and, in oblique cases, the preposition it follows. A description
of prepositions and similar morphemes, including the pronominal forms they select,
is therefore also presented in section 6.3 along with other aspects of the prepositional
system, such as the modiﬁcation of prepositional phrases by adverbs or by further
prepositional phrases and the lexical selection of prepositions by certain verbs. The
chapter concludes by returning to the discussion of pronominal forms, where it is
suggested that these diﬀerent forms may be best described as realisations of case.
Taking into account evidence from tone alternations and typological universals, it is
tentatively concluded that Katcha personal pronouns occur in one of three three cases:
Nominative, Accusative and Oblique.
    Chapter 7 describes the derivational verbal suﬃxes known as ‘verb extensions’
(VEs), whose function is to increase or decrease semantic valency, licensing or prohibit-
ing the presence of nominals as arguments within the proposition. The vast majority
of VEs in Katcha are detransitivising, their function being to license the absence of
otherwise mandatory core arguments. A descriptive analysis is given classifying them
according to the number and type of their argument roles. In addition to the valency
reducing VEs, Katcha has one morpheme which appears to be valency increasing,
namely the applicative, though it is noted that in several ways the Katcha ‘applicative’
is rather atypical. Finally, reciprocal and reﬂexive forms are discussed. These are
functionally similar to the valency decreasing verb extensions of section 7.2, but it is
suggested that they may in fact be pronominal constructions.","[23, 24, 25]"
"6.3.2 PossessiveDemonstrative pronouns ja/mɔ/nɔPossessive phrases and relative clauses are formed using the demonstrative pronoun. A
full analysis of these constructions is given in chapter 5. The relevance to the current
discussion is to note that when the possessor (or the subject of the relative clause) is
a pronoun, the oblique form of the pronoun is used. The vowel of the demonstrative
pronoun assimilates to the initial vowel of the pronoun making it long. The initial
vowel takes a high tone. Thus in a context such as (6.46), the ‘possessive pronouns’ are
realised as in (6.47).(6.46) ɲɔrɔɲɔrɔ́ jé-été

Possessive maIn addition to the demonstrative pronoun, nouns may be modiﬁed by the morpheme
ma. According to Stevenson, this is used for ‘non-intimate possession’ (Stevenson
1941:47) or for ‘cases where the relationship is not one of possession, eg. denoting
origin, composition.’ (Stevenson 1956-57:61) It is often used when a noun is modiﬁed
by another nominal, as in (6.48).

(6.49). When the modiﬁer of tumma is introduced by ma, the relationship is non-
possessive (6.49a); when the modiﬁer of tumma is introduced by the demonstrative
pronoun nɔ, the relationship is one of possession (6.49b). In the former case, ‘words of
David’ refers to a story about David; in the latter ‘words of the children’ refers to the
children’s words.7(6.49) a.      aalo aaga kakiïrï          [tumma ma          a ud ] ka     sorne

relationships the demonstrative pronouns are preferred (6.50), while for more distant
relationships ma is used (6.51).

    These facts are not speciﬁc to tʊmma. Stevenson (1991:358) gives a further example: ‘ꞌdi ́ yá Kúkù
would be the ususal form, but ꞌdi ́ má Kúkù (not usual) could mean “a Kuku-like house”, “a house of
the kind Kuku would build.” ’

are ‘owned’ more than distant ones. That the relationship is the relevant factor here
is indicated by (6.52), where both types of ‘possession’ are used in not only the same
source, but the same sentence. Again, the more distant relationships (‘friend’ and
‘clan’) are modiﬁed by ma while the closer relationship (‘brother’) is modiﬁed by the
demonstrative pronoun nɔ.(6.52) fa      t mm n         [kateefe      ma oꞌo ] nja

        ‘do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives’           (LUK 14.12)   Some doubt is thrown on this analysis, however, by the fact that there are some
examples of certain relational nouns occurring with both types of ‘possessive’. These
occur even within the same passage and, unlike the example of (6.49) above, it is not
clear that there is a semantic distinction to which the diﬀerence can be attributed. In
Matthew chapter 5, diidi, ‘enemy’, occurs with both ma and nɔ́ (6.53).

be completely determined by the nature of the relationship. One possibility is simply
that the choice is optional, but it should be noted that in the case of öre,‘brother’,
6.3. Related Morphemes                                                              115the demonstrative is used signiﬁcantly more often than ma, so the association of the
demonstrative construction with the closer relationships is at the very least a strong
tendency.
   Another point to note is that both (6.53) and (6.54) involve obvious contrast. The
pairs of propositions they express are parallel and opposite. The stylistics of written
Katcha prose are outwith the scope of this research but it appears that the translators
have chosen contrasting grammatical constructions to express these contrasts. This is
not just true of the the type of possessive used, but there are also contrasts in tense,
number and vocabulary. So one possibility is that in these cases, the translators have
deliberately used the ‘wrong’ possessive construction for stylistic eﬀect.","[130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"
"6.3.1 Directional (goal)
The morpheme ca may be a preposition. This morpheme occurs in (6.20-6.21) where
it is glossed as dir ((6.21) is repeated below for convenience). However, its status
is unclear. It may be a weakened form of locative ká, or it may be a fully-ﬂedged
preposition in its own right, formed from the verb acɔ ‘go’. A third analysis would be
that, at least in some instances, it has not undergone grammaticalization and remains
a form of the verb.(6.21) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkʊ́nʊ́ cá lámáːcá      tá-mɔ́               kákka
        Kuku 3m.go.to dir grinding.hut non.core-3f.dem Kaka
        ‘Kuku is going to Kaka’s grinding room.’   Evidence that ca may be a form of ká comes from the fact that there seems to be an
alternation between the two forms. Although in (6.21) ʊ́ŋkʊ́nʊ́ ‘go.to’ is followed by cá,
in (6.14) and (6.17) the same verb is followed by locative ká, with no obvious diﬀerence
in meaning. Stevenson (1941:74) also notes this alternation, stating that it is restricted
to certain verbs. An additional piece of evidence is the fact that during ﬁeldwork no
examples of ca with personal pronouns were found. This would be unexpected if ca
were a preposition. It would also be unexpected if ca were a verb that takes a direct
object, which appears to be the case in (6.18-6.19). So it may be that directional ca is
in fact a variant of locative ká which occurs in certain (as yet unspeciﬁed) contexts.
   Waag (2012:4) suggests that although ca is clearly related to the verb, it may have
grammaticalized in certain contexts and so includes c- in her table of case aﬃxes as
‘direction to’ (Waag 2012:6). In the draft Katcha New Testament, ca is commonly
glossed as ‘to’, rather than ‘go’, which may suggest some native speaker intuition in
this direction. In regard to its interaction with personal pronouns, Waag places ca
in the third group, those which take core 1st and 2nd person pronouns but oblique
3rd person pronouns. As just noted, I was unable to conﬁrm this. If Waag’s data
is accurate, this would clearly distinguish ca it from locative ká, which takes oblique
forms throughout.
   The third possibility is that ca is a variant of the verb acɔ ‘go’. This is the view taken
by Stevenson (1941:74). As evidence, he cites the negative imperative form, though the
argument is somewhat opaque, consisting of three example sentences and the statement,
‘the negative imperative indicates that no preposition is involved.’ (Stevenson 1941:74)
In the draft Katcha New Testament this morpheme, which is most frequently realised
110                            Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and Prepositionsphonetically as /ca/ is invariably spelled as ‘co’. This may suggest some native speaker
intuition that it is at least related to the verb. More signiﬁcantly, it is not unusual for
the (fully inﬂected) verb form acɔ to follow another verb of motion. Generally this is
ʊ́ŋkéːne.5 The combination ʊ́ŋkéːne acɔ occurs frequently, often expressing the notion
of leaving or setting out to go somewhere as in (6.45). It may be that ʊ́ŋkʊ́nʊ́ acɔ is
also a licit combination of verbs, and that ca following the verb of motion in (6.21) is
in fact a form of the verb acɔ.(6.45) unggeene aaco                  a     naanya kuꞌbꞌba
         ʊŋkeːne       a-acɔ          a     na-anya kʊɓɓa
         3m.go.out 3m.pfv-go dat pl-town far.away
         ‘he set oﬀ for a distant country.’                                                 (LUK 15.13)    My tentative analysis is to take the third position and to treat ca as a verb form.
One of the additional pieces of evidence for this analysis comes from looking more
carefully at its complement. In (6.18-6.19), the verb acɔ seems to take a direct object.
However, in (6.45) it appears to be followed by the dative marker a. This is a pattern
that is repeated throughout the corpus of written Katcha. For example, in the Gospel
of Luke, there are 31 examples of acɔ followed directly by a (consonant-initial) nominal
object, but 6 examples of acɔ followed by dative a before the noun. The ‘preposition’
ca/cɔ shows a similar pattern. There are 33 examples in Luke of cɔ followed directly by
a (consonant-initial) nominal object, but 15 examples of cɔ followed by dative a before
the noun. There is no obvious pattern to the presence or absence of the dative a; I
leave aside the question of whether there is a pattern yet to be discovered, whether it
is genuinely optional or whether there is simply an orthographic inconsistency.6 The
relevant fact is that the ‘preposition’ ca/cɔ displays the same behaviour as the verb
acɔ.
    During ﬁeldwork, no examples of cɔ with personal pronouns were elicited; according
to the Katcha speakers I worked with, it is not possible for cɔ to be followed by a
personal pronoun. This contrasts with Waag’s (2012:6) description of c- as belonging
to the third type of preposition, which take core 1st and 2nd person pronouns but
oblique 3rd person pronouns. In the draft Katcha New Testament there are very few
examples of cɔ followed by a pronoun. The only attested examples are all with the 3rd
person masculine oblique pronoun ɪːnɪ (written with a lenghtened initial vowel). There
is insuﬃcient data to be conclusive, but one plausible speculation is that the reason
I was unable to elicit a cɔ+pronoun sequence when asking for it directly is that such
    5
      ʊ́ŋkéːne is a non-goal-directed verb of motion (‘go oﬀ, go out, wander’) and contrasts with ʊ́ŋkʊ́nʊ́
which implies a goal or destination (‘go to’).
    6
      Given the fact that Katcha vowels so frequently undergo processes of harmony and/or ellision, it
is plausible that these examples contain an underlying a that has been ellided and that the translators
may have been inconsistent in whether or not they have included it in the transcription.

would be consistent with the form of the pronoun which occurs in the New Testament
and also with Waag’s data. If this speculation turns out to be correct, that cɔ is
followed by dative a, it would strongly suggest that the ‘morpheme’ commonly realised
as ca is underlyingly a cɔ+a sequence and that cɔ is in fact (a form of) the verb acɔ.
Of course, such an analysis does not preclude the possibility that cɔ+a is in the process
of undergoing grammaticalization into a preposition ca.","[128, 129, 130]"
