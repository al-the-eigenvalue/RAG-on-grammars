"  (2) USE OF SUBJECTIVE FORMS. The subjective enclitics may be
used as the subject of a non-subordinate verb or as the object of an
imperative (§ 52).     The animate dual -' . . .πιϊ-, however, of
which examples will be given separately, functions only as a subject,
sometimes also as a possessive. Subjective examples of enclitic
pronouns, attached both to verbs and to other parts of speech, are:im'yuntcar'oani    did I take a drink?
Ι/α'α'ίχυ-η ίχα' 'aαϊ' would that I might die!
a'ivwmi p\ni'kaiva     now-I shall-see

    you 2 do as (you) sit?
ivi'yuntcar'oa yA did he take a drink?
qania tjA pinika       house-obj.-he see, he see(s) (the) house
pA'qa'yupiay'iywA      he (inv.) was killed (long ago)

   tive? why do they always do so?
a'a'{i)Yuqwa(i)'yim""''i they (inv.) are good
7nwava'ami qari'p 'iya' there-they (inv.) dwelt   In connection with the use of second person singular -' certain
peculiar contraction phenomena are to be noted. Ordinarily the
pronominal -' does not amalgamate with a ' in the last syllable of the
word to which it is attached (e. g. from -ywa'ai- ΤΟ GO IN ORDER TO
is formed ηα'υ,'ψναίχινα'αί'' GO THOU AND HANG THYSELF!), but in
               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean    Language
           SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                    185other cases such amalgamation takes place, so that no specific pro-
nominal element is apparent at all. This is notably the case with
interrogative -ru'a-, e. g.:
im'yiro'"" art thou drinking? ( < -ro'a- + -'; not -ro'a')
cu(w)a'ru' nyn o'c C maybe you'll dream
   Probably this difference of treatment has something to do with the
difference between inherent and accessory ' (§ 15, 1). Furthermore,
the pronominal       is lost in certain cases, notably after qatcu- NOT,
after demonstrative ai- (§ 43, 5), and before ai- τ ο SAY and ani- τ ο
DO; a final -a is then elided before following a-. Examples are:
qatcu' n a 'n ia'ap-A not-thou say-negative, do not say anything
a'i(y) igiT a'iimA that-obj.-thou indeed say-usitative, you are indeed
   wont to say ( = ai-a- iy'ir, cf. a'ian iy'ir that-I indeed)
u w
 m a'mkaim i aik ?A that-do-resultative-usitative-thou said; remains
   like that, you said ( = -mia- ai-)
Tti'ani   aik-A     too-bad-thou say, (it is) too bad (that) you say
   ( = -n ia-' ai-, cf. Tfi'anian aik-ϊΑ it is too bad t h a t I say)
mani'riumpanti'yw      aik -A that-do-momentaneous-future-participle-
   him (inv.)-thou say; being about to do thus to him, you say ( =
   -Tjwa- ai-; for combination of enclitic pronouns, see § 41, 2, a, end)
αχα'ηίχαί 'anik -.i what-do-subordinating-thou do? why do you do
   so? ( = -jfoi' *ani-)
  The third person inanimate enclitic pronouns (-aqa- and -' . . .q wa-)
are very often used, as in English, in an impersonal sense, particularly
in references to the weather. Examples are:
u7)wa'(i)y'iaq A it is raining (said by one who sees it raining)
ui)wa'(i)'yiqwA    it is raining (said by one who does not see it rain)
nia'va n-i'aq-WA it will blow
arja""q• νυηαϊ   who-it (inv.) then? who is it, then?
  Subjective examples of animate dual -' . . .m l- are:
mami qa 'y'tmi they 2 (vis.) sing (not equivalent to qa 'y'imi they 2
  inv. sing, as ma'mi implies visibility, but to qa 'yiam'i they 2 sing;
  in mami qa 'y'imi duality is expressly indicated by -' . . .mi-,
  in qa 'yiami merely implied because of singular form of verb)
mam'Cntca' pi'jn'tci'imi they 2 (vis.) arrived
tami'ntca' pipi'tci'mi   we 2 (inclus.) arrived
tami qani'va 'm uni'n'ni'   we-2 (inclus.) house-at-dual do-continua-

of transitive verbs, as subjects of subordinate verbs, and as possessives.
For their use in subordinate verb forms, see § 55, 1. Possessives,
exemplified only in noun forms, are treated below (4). Examples
of enclitic pronouns in a properly objective sense are:qu'qwi'tu'acuyaywanoani          would t h a t they (indef.) would shoot me!
    I wish I would get shot!
uvwa'""nfini ya'ijqik / there-being-me fetch-to-hither, bring (it) there

    the rain approaches us 2 (inclus.) (note t h a t am, § 42, 6, refers to
    uywa'ri-, while -rani, which comes in between, anticipates -rami of
    following verb)

              SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                          187   (4) USE OF OBJECTIVE FORMS AS POSSESSIVE PRONOMINAL EN-
CLITICS. In a possessive sense enclitic pronouns can be used only
with nouns. Inasmuch, however, as such an enclitic, even when
appended to a noun, can have objective (or, in most cases, also sub-
jective) significance, a theoretical ambiguity sometimes results. Thus,
a form like qam'anl HOUSE-OBJ.-I (or ME, MY) may be interpreted
as signifying either MY HOUSE (obj.) or I (DO so AND so το) A HOUSE.
The form of the whole sentence or the context generally removes
the ambiguity. In practice a noun with possessive enclitic is generally
followed by a postnominal article-pronoun, e. g. qani'an am MY-
HOUSE (OBJ.) IT, in which case no ambiguity is possible. Examples
of possessive enclitics are:purjqu'm my horse; qu'tcu'mpuyquTjwini my cattle (lit., buffalo-pets)
dci'ni   pA'tca'n-     cc'RI to*to'q wa'ar/q'i   this-me mocasin-my    it   patch
    (distributively)- for, patch these moccasins of mine for me
fiyi'virarm    friend-our (dual inclusive); you and I who are friends

   mothers
paa""ami thy aunt; paa'(i)'yami         thy aunt (obj.)
pia'ru'a'm aro""a mother-interrogative- thy is, is it your mother?
pi(y)a'YUM    U'IJWA   mother-your (plur.) she, your (plur.) mother
taya'n a x ituywa yA knee-in-to-his (vis.), into his knee
paml'vqWA his (inv.) elder brother
aru""ana'yiVA be-verbal noun-his (inv.), his being, his property
ari'c υ taywa 'q• am that (inan.) tooth-its (vis.) it, that tooth of it
yaya 'ma q-A end-at-its, at its end
A'SI'a-(i)ya'Q WA its surface, bark (obj.)
nia 'viy'wa m,· aijA chief-possessed-their (vis.) he, their chief
pi{y)a""am'i their (inv.) mother
   Instead of -am'i- THEIR (vis.) and -' . . .m i- THEIR (inv.) are
sometimes found the corresponding singular forms -αηα-, -' . . .rjwa-.
This takes place, though not always, when the person referred to by
the enclitic pronoun precedes with the plural animate suffix -ψνϊ-
(-TO I-; § 48,1), evidently in order to avoid a double plural. Analogous
phenomena will meet us again (§ 41, 1, e; § 42, 2 and 5). Examples of
this ""number dissimilation"" in possessive forms are:
qum a'rjwia m,· αηΑ ma 'ai>LTjWA             husband-plural-objective-their   he
   ( = them; § 42, 2, end) chief-his (inv.; = their inv.); their-husbands

      188                                 SAPIR         (obj.) their-chief, chief of their husbands (for possessive use of noun
         objectives see § 49,2; for pleonastic use of possessive pronoun,
         below)
      ""'a't iywayw'ia'aywA good-possessed-plural-obj.-his (inv.), their (inv.)
         good ones (anim. obj.), good ones (anim. obj.)
         The reflexive possessive -vi- occurs only in objective forms, i. e.
      after objective -a-, -ya- (§ 49, 1); after nominalizing -n a- (§ 25, 3); and
      after postpositions, which are syntactically equivalent to the objec-
      tive (§ 50, 3). The reflexive possessive indicates t h a t the possessor is
      the same person as the subject of the sentence. Ordinarily it refers
      to the third person, but it may also be employed in first and second
      personal references. Examples <)f its use are:
      qaiu 'u'r<i paa'iav utjWA house (obj.) it-towards aunt-obj.- own she

         in t h a t same little cave of mine         Explicitly plural (or dual) forms of the third person reflexive pos-
      sessive are also found; they are compounded of -am 'i- THEIR (vis.)
      or -' . . .m 'i- THEIR (inv.) and -®ϊ-, theoretical . . .m 'ivi- appearing,
      however, as       . . .movi-, - . . .m-auv'i-. Examples are:
      qaTu'va ntuxwa ami^i     to their own house
      puyqu'tsia mi^i their (2) own dear horse (obj.)
      ροτο'ιη'αηιαιιφϊ, -ιηοφϊ with their (2) own canes (cf. pars'>ηα(υ)φϊ
        with his own cane); pan'q (w)ama("")mau£i     with their own canes
        (for -q a- see § 48, 2)
        Explicitly dual forms of the reflexive possessive are made by

shows clearly t h a t third person animate plural invisible     . . .m 'i-
is not identical with animate dual     . . .m-ϊ-, though it seems some-
times to intercross it in usage. Examples of -νϊ'ϊιη ϊ- are:

  there-they (inv.) stayed-dual house-objective-her mother-obj.-
  own-dual house-at; there they 2 stayed (at) her house, at their
  (2) mother's house
   (5) PLEONASTIC FORMS.        Double (or even more frequent)
expression of pronominal elements is very common in Paiute. Ex-
amples of the repetition of the subjective or objective pronoun, both
pronouns enclitic or one enclitic and the other independent, have
occurred in preceding lists. There is a marked tendency for the
objective enclitic pronoun to attach itself to the verb even if it is
elsewhere expressed in the sentence; in transitive sentences the
enclitic subject seems to be normally attached to the verb only in
combination with the enclitic object (§ 41, 2, a). Particularly char-
acteristic is the employment of enclitic possessives together with
genitives (i. e. objectives) of the corresponding independent pro-
noun, e. g.:n'i'mA pavi'lsini       me my-elder brother
maya'iA ραα'ατ/Λ h i m h i s - a u n t
pi 'xäSiTj'w'im imi'A pigs-thy thee, thy pigs
imi'A paa'i'ami thee aunt-obj.-thy, thy aunt (obj.)
   Pleonasm is abundantly illustrated also in nouns, which are often
anticipated or redundantly referred to by pronouns, independent or
enclitic. Of such usages also examples have already been given.
Particularly frequent is the occurrence of an objective enclitic pronoun
of the third person with an objective noun, e. g. ι SEE-IT HOUSE (OBJ.)
as equivalent of ι SEE HOUSE (OBJ.). In genitive constructions this
is almost the rule, e. g. ραα'ία η.ι qaniar/A AUNT-OBJ.-HIS HOUSE-HER,
HIS AUNT'S HOUSE; also paa'iarjA       qanl.","[202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207]"
"   (3) V E R B A L NOUN IN -na-.    Verbal nouns in -na- are freely
formed from all verbs and often appear in syntactic combinations.
More often than not, a verbal noun in -na- is used with a possessive
pronoun, often in a subjective or objective relative sense. When a
tense suffix is absent, it refers to present or general time. Futures
in -va-na- (cf. § 32, 4) and perfectives in -qai-na- (cf. § 32, 3) are also
very common. In the case of transitive verbs, the action is to be
thought of as passive rather than active, e. g. ampa'yanani MY TALK-
ING, WHAT is SAID BY ME. Nevertheless, the matter of voice does
not seem to be clearly defined in -na- forms. Examples are:ni'ni no'nam me carying-my, my pack
nirjw'i RUqwat uywaq an araTjWA person-under-to-plural subj.-verbal
   noun- our, our going under a person, our being beaten
w'a'yin a m· ur 'a-'i'niijucampA   shouting-their it silent-become-but,
    but their shouting became silent
to'o'ivi'oran'naTjw am bulrush-digging-his it, the bulrushes he digs
    (dug) up
rii' o'pa' αηι'υα η ι imi a'i'nami I thus do-shall thee saying-thy, I
    shall do as you say
tFqa'va n'arjw U'R eat-future-verbal noun-his it, his being about to
    eat, for him to eat
ngna'e-iva n ani what I shall dream
nqno'cjfainani what I dreamt
mwa'ij 'ani'k a 'ia'vuruijuqwainanl that-one do-resultative wounded-
    make-momentaneous-perfective-verbal noun-my, that one it is
    whom I have wounded  Cases of -n a- as noun-forming or adjective-forming derivative
without clear verbal force are uncommon, e.g.:
uru""anA being, property < uru'a- to be
wiyo'o*paq%nA vulva-perforated-verbal noun, vagina
ava""""nA much < ava'"" to be much
  For the idiomatic use of -n a-c-u- with verbs of doing and saying,
see § 62.

nominalizing suffixes of more than ordinarily concrete significance.

        another-contest), obj. nayu'q wipaiA
      oo'mpA fist-fight, obj. oo'mpaiA
        An isolated noun suffix -va-' occurs in narjqa'va-' EAR (absolute
      naj)qa'va<j>i) < narjqa- ΤΟ HEAR. Also isolated is -mpa-"" in tuyumpa-'
      SKY < tuyu-"" UP. Both of these are old Shoshonean elements, cf.

         (c) - N -, -t 'i·-, -nti - CANYON MOUTH. This suffix seems to be added
      only to noun stems, but is most conveniently listed here. Perhaps

recognized as noun suffixes (or stereotyped compounded stems),
but to which no definite meaning can be assigned. Among these is

meaning are frequently employed in Paiute to express the passive
participle, -p i- and -ρϊ-.  I t is difficult to say just what difference
of meaning there is between these elements, though they are not
used interchangeably. On the whole, -p i- seems to have a more
substantival force, -p i- a more truly participial one; it would be
incorrect to press this point, however. Moreover, -p i- is primarily
tenseless except when preceded by specific tense elements, e. g.
future -να -; -ρ ϊ- is always preterital. Both may be formed from
intransitive stems, though derivatives formed from transitive verbs
are naturally far more common.

   (6) ACTIVE PARTICIPLES. The primary form of the active parti-
cipial suffix is -ti-n. When unpreceded by a tense element, it refers
to present time or, particularly in secondary substantival uses, is
tenseless. Participles of explicitly temporal reference may be
formed from the present participle by prefixing appropriate temporal
suffixes to -ti-n. Animate plurals are formed by suffixing -m i- (§
48, 1, a), e. g. -rim 'i-.
    (a) Present participle: -fi-"" (-<«-""• after i; -ntci-n after nasal +      i),
-ti-n, -nfi-"". Examples are:

   (c) Usitative participle: -vatci-"", -mpatci-"". The usitative element

preterital -p'iyai-.   This participle differs from the preceding in
referring more explicitly to past time, also in being more frequently
used in narrative as a sort of equivalent for properly preterital forms
in -p 'iyai- (see §32 , 6; also § 55, 4, e). Examples are:

   (f) Animate plurals of participles.    Animate plurals of active
participles have been already referred to. They end in -fi-m 'i-. A
curious idiom allows of their use also as singulars. This takes place
when the participle refers to a person (or animal) that is singled out
from a number or is compared with others. The plural ending of the
participle, in other words, refers to the implied collectivity rather
than to the person explicitly indicated. Examples are:
qu'tca'p-oto'qwarimi   blue-round-adj. verb-partic.-plur., one who is
   blue around (as contrasted with others of different color)

   A number of verb-forming suffixes are in common use. They trans-
form noun, adjective, and demonstrative stems into verbs.
   (1) Elements suffixed to noun and adjective stems.
  (a) -yai-, -q ai-, -rjqai-, ΤΟ BE. Any noun or participle may become
a verb of being by means of this suffix, e. g.:
nitjwi-' person                        niywl'xaiYU while being a person
qani-' house                           qam'xai-ηυ house-be-momentan-
                                         eous, to be already manifest as

                                          und-like, if (you) are to be
                                         greater than I
   For negative - ai- NOT TO BE, see § 57, 2 c.
   Before subordinating -q u- (§ 55,1, e) verbifying -Icai- ΤΟ BE becomes
-ka -, e. g.:
a'ip atsiyai-   to be a boy            a'ip aisiya q uni   when I was a
                                          boy
   For corresponding negative -a '-q u- WHEN NOT TO BE, see § 57, 2, c.
  The active participial form of this suffix is -yanti-n, -q anfi-"",
-Tjqanfi-"". e. g.:
                           Southern   Paiute,    a Shoshonean                Language                     SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN                           LANGUAGE           133tA'qa      -'     to be flat                            tA'qa       'yanti   being flat, flat coun-

yu(w)a-'                                                yu{w)a    'axant'i  being level, plain
wTqanoi-'                to be circular                 wfqo'noikant'i        circular
  As may be seen from these examples, -kanfi-n        forms many nouns
and adjectives. Many of these participial forms, indeed, seem to be
more freely used than the -kai- verbs from which they are derived
   Compounded with indirective -iiqi- (§ 29, 2) this element seems to
appear as -ai- (cf. negative -ai- NOT TO BE, § 57, 2, c). -ai-rjqi- seems
to indicate το ACT L I K E —το. It occurs in:
                 to be coyote; to
c'ina'ywavi-ylfai-                                      φια'ψνανι'αίηφ,ί'     acts like coyote
   be amorous, ""mushy""                                      to (her); acts in an inordinately
                                                            amorous manner toward (her)
   (b) -yai-, -qai-, -rjqai- ΤΟ HAVE. This element closely parallels the
preceding in all its forms (including negative - a i ; subordinate - k a - q u - ;
negative subordinate -a'-qu-;      participle -kanti-n).    From the form
alone it is not always possible to tell whether the -kai- suffix denotes το
B E o r τ ο H A V E ; e . g . tümpv,i}f         ai-   τ ο B E A R O C K o r τ ο H A V E A ROCK.
Frequently, however, the theoretical ambiguity is removed by the
use of a nominal possessive suffix (§ 24, 2) before the -kai-; e. g.
sari      'tsiyaivätcf       WONT TO B E        A DOG, b u t sari'vurjquxwaivätci             WONT
TO H A V E A DOG (§ 24, 2, e). On account of their particular frequency,
forms in -a-yai- (§ 24, 2, a) are separately listed.
  Examples of -yai-, -q ai-, -rjqai- ΤΟ H A V E are:

  (a) -ro'a- το BE; makes substantive verbs from demonstrative o-
and u-, e. g. aro'a- το BE (visible subject). Substantive verbs are
dealt with in § 56.

   (b) -ni- ΤΟ ACT, DO, BE. This suffix makes verbs of action or
manner out of demonstrative stems, also out of interrogative aya-,
e. g. an i- ΤΟ DO SO, TO ACT THUS; ayan-i- ΤΟ DO WHAT? TO ACT HOW?
For examples see § 43, 3. These verbs are often used absolutely as
adverbs of manner, e. g. aya'm HOW?
   (c) -n'i- (-n i'i-) verbalizing suffix appended to demonstrative
stem + postposition (see § 43, 1). From ίνα·- THIS-AT, H E B E , e. g., is
formed iva n 'i- το BE HERE. It is possible that this element is
identical with continuative -n-'i- (§ 30, 12); both are two-moraed.
Examples are:

                               § 27.   General remarks.
   The suffixes added to verb stems or verbalized bases (see § 26)
may be grouped into six distinct classes: suffixes of movement, of
voice, of verbal aspect, of plurality, of tense, and of mode. Many
of these may be considered as more properly formal than derivative
in character, but the line is in any case not easy to draw.

                 SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                        139                            § 28.    Suffixes of movement.
   In origin these are in all probability verb stems that have become
specialized as second members of verb + verb compounds (§ 18, 2, a).
This appears quite plausible in view of the fact that several verb
stems of movement (e. g. pay(a)i-n ΤΟ GO, pa(i)yi- ΤΟ RETURN) are
frequently used in composition in a quasi-formal sense.  (1) -ywa'ai-', -qwa'ai-', -yqwa'ai-' ΤΟ GO WHILE -ING, TO MOVE.
This is generally used only in verbs whose animate subject is singular.
For corresponding plurals the compounded verb-stem -mia- SEVERAL
MOVE is used (for examples see § 18, 2, a). Examples of -ywa'ai- are:nontsi-'      to fly                         nontsi'%w'a.i'   goes flying, flies

   The idea of GOING, as some of these examples show, shades off into
that      of    BECOMING.    (2) -q-waai-' (ΤΟ MOVE) OFF, AWAY.      This is evidently nothing
but a specialized use of the geminated form of the preceding suffix.

merely a specialized use of the spirantized form of (a). Examples
are:

ani- to do so                          ani''aip     lya went and did so   In many cases it is not easy to be clear as to whether examples of
-qwa'ai- and -ywa'ai- are to be classed under (a) or under (b) and
(c). I t is highly probable that -q wa'ai- (b) and -ywa'ai- (c) are
related to each other as momentaneous and durative (see § 53, 2, b for
momentaneous gemination). The two uses of -ywa'ai-, WHILE GOING
and το GO IN ORDER TO, are reflected in its plural correspondent
-m-ia-, e. g. qa'mia- SEVERAL SING WHILE ON (THEIR) WAY and
SEVERAL GO IN ORDER TO SING.   (4) -m'mia- CONTINUOUS MOTION. This element, which is perhaps
etymologically connected with plural mia- SEVERAL TRAVEL, is very
similar in significance to -kwa'ai- (a) and to compounded -pay(a)i-
WHILE JOURNEYING.       The idea of continuity, however, seems to
be more explicit. Moreover, the movement referred to is not neces-
sarily the straight-line movement of normal walking or travel, but
may be the periodic movement say of dancing. Examples are:poya-     to run                       po• yam mia.t        goes running,

                         § 29.   Suffixes of voice.
   There are two groups of suffixed elements that indicate voice, i. e.
direction of action with reference to subject, object, or indirect object.
The first group (1-9) is a primary series that is not freely used; that is
closely welded with the verb stem (often with internal stem changes);
that occurs in contrasting pairs of mediopassive (or intransitive)
and active (or transitive); and that, for the most part, involve at the
same time other ideas than that of voice, namely verbal aspect (see
3 below) and number. This group will be only listed here for con-
venience of reference and taken up later under other headings. The
second group (10-14) is used with great freedom and indicates voice
relations of a somewhat more external sort. Suffixes of the latter
sort are often appended to the former.  (1) -q-i- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of momentaneous aspect
and singular number (see § 30, 3).
   (2) -71-, (-ijqi-) mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of iterative-dura-
tive aspect (see § 30, 2).
  (3) -ya- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of durative aspect (see
§ 30, 1).
  (4) -tcai- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of primarily durative
aspect and of plural number (see § 31, 2, a).
   (5) -na- transitive suffix of durative aspect and singular number
of object (see § 31, 2, b).
  (6) -n'na- transitive suffix of momentaneous aspect and singular
number of object (see § 31, 2, c).
  (7) -tea- transitive suffix of plural number of object (see § 31, 2, d).
  (8) -a - final stem vowel indicating active voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -i- (9).
  (9) -i- final stem vowel indicating inactive voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -a - (8).
   (10) -rjqi-"" transitivizing or activating suffix appended to verbs
of primarily mediopassive aspect. It is particularly common with
preceding -q i-, -yi- (1 and 2 above) and generally occurs with an
instrumental prefix in the verb (§ 21). Before it mediopassive -i- (see
9 above) sometimes becomes active -a - (8); an -a- of the active stem

    (11) -rjqi-' indirective: το, FOR. This extremely common suffix
expresses dative or indirective relations and may be rendered το,
FOR, FROM, WITH, AGAINST. The indirect object is always animate.

cases the person of the indirect object is not really affected by the
action at all but is merely interested in it. Such ethical datives with
first person indirect object are frequently employed to indicate an
affectionate attitude on the part of the speaker, e. g.:
αχα'η iyqitjuqwaiyurii' ani'k a     what-do-for-momentaneous-resulta-
  tive-subordinate-me-thou do-so? what happened to you for me?

  In a considerable number of cases the indirective - r j q i h a s grown
so to the stem as to give a new meaning in which the indirective
idea is not very prominent, e. g.:
pitci-   to arrive                    pitcATjqi- to arrive to, engage
                                         with (cf. also uni-vitci- to do-
                                         arrive, attack)
nayuqwi- to reciprocally-shoot        nayu'q wiijqi- to fight

   (12) -iui- causative, freely suffixed to both transitive and intransi-
tive verbs. Examples are:

   Much less frequently -iui- makes causatives out of nouns, e. g.:

   A few survivals seem to indicate t h a t -tui- is but the geminated
form of an older variable -r'ui-, -t ui-, -ntui-, which has become
generalized for all cases. There seems also to have been an alterna-
tion between momentaneous -t'ui- andd urative -r'ui- (see § 53, 2, b).
An example of causative -ntui- is 'a'cmtui- τ ο LIKE. Causative
-r'ui- (durative) is exemplified in iyä'r'ui- το CAUSE TO BE AFRAID, TO
FRIGHTEN; with this contrast momentaneous iya'tui-         το FRIGHTEN
(at one moment of time).   (12a) -n-i- causative. This element occurs so uncommonly t h a t
it has not been found possible to determine its precise application.
Examples are:
yu'u'rumpiyai(y)aqaijA       leg-make-causative-past-it (vis.)-he (vis.),
    he made a leg out of it
naywi'qa'minip'iya'       self-cover-causative-past, covered (him)self
    (with leaves) (cf. wVqa'm'C covers, tr.)
Ν A' SO'XO' ma'mp'iya' covered (him)self with moist ground, dirt (cf.
    also NA^sa'xu'map 'iya' covered self with dirt)
   In the last two examples, which are provided with reflexive pre-
fixes, it is to be noted t h a t the reflexive is better considered the logical
object of the causative suffix than of the verb; e. g. HE CAUSED HIM-
SELF TO BE COVERED, not HF. CAUSED TO COVER HIMSELF.                 Contrast,
with ordinary causative -tui- (12), navl' η ifuik • ai (y)ayan/ H E CAUSED
ME TO S E E HIMSELF, not HE CAUSED HIMSELF TO SEE ME. Possibly -n-i-
is best defined as an indirect causative, like -rjqi- (10, 11), whose -y-
is perhaps a reduced form of -ni-; e. g. HE MADE IT INTO A LEG,
HE COVERED TO HIMSELF.   (13) -ti -s passive; sometimes heard as -H-, but always two-
moraed. This suffix is freely used to make true passives out of
transitive verbs. Examples are:
tana- to hit, punch                      t,ma't i svwa n-iani I shall be hit
pAxqa-r)u- to kill                       pA'qa'yuti'qaq a'      (they) have

   The last two examples illustrate passive participles in -t'i-ri-n (cf.
§ 25, 6, a). These differ from passive participles in -pi- and -p'i-
(§ 25, 5) in referring to passing or non-characteristic states. Con-
trasting with SA'pi'x-AtiRi, for instance, is SA'pi'xam ip i ONE WHO
IS ALWAYS OVERCOME (-m i- is usitative, § 30, 10).
   Passives may be readily formed from causatives, e. g. ivi'( uii}uti -
tca r)A D R I N K - C A U S E - M O M E N T A N E O U S - P A S S I V E - P R E T E R I T -   H E , HE   WAS
CAUSED TO DRINK.      Here the causative suffix precedes the passive,
as is to be expected. Curiously enough, the same order is followed
in causatives of passives, an indirective -rjqi- coming in between the
causative suffix and the passive - t i - , e. g.:
maa'i(  uiyki'fi v""'a yarayWA   catch-cause-to-passive-shall-he-us, he will
   get us caught (lit., he will cause to us to be caught)
pA'qa'niuiyqiti tca rjA kill-cause-to-passive-preterit-him, (he) caused
   him to be killed (for -nlui- cf. 12 above)
  In other words, the passive suffix can not precede the causative.
In the preceding examples the indirective is required to point to the
logical object as the indirect object, the passive of the verb itself
being apparently conceived of as the direct object, e. g. H E WILL-
CAUSE-BEING-CAUGHT TO-US.        That these forms are causatives of
passives, not, as would be inferred from their appearance, passives of
causatives, is proved by the absence of a plural subjective -q a- (see
§ 31, 1, c) in the first form above; this would be required if the fomr
were to be understood as WE SHALL B E CAUSED TO B E CAUGHT BY HIM.
   (14) -tu'a-' (-t' ua- ) impersonal. Verbs with impersonal subject
or, less often, object refer either to an indefinitely defined person or
to a collectivity, people in general. In the latter case, if used sub
jectively, it may be preceded by the pluralizing -qa- (§ 31, 1, c). The
impersonal suffix is often employed as the equivalent of the passive,
never simultaneously with it. It follows perfective -qai- and nar-
rative preterit -ρϊ(α)·γαί-, but precedes present -yi- and future
-va (nia)-    (see § 34). Curiously enough, present -yi- regularly

32, 8). As already noted (§ 19, 2, e), it is frequently accompanied
by enclitic -w oa-. Examples of subjective -t-u'a- are:
pAKqa'rju(ua{i)ylayA kill-momentaneous-impersonal-present-him, they
    (indef.) kill him, he is being killed
pApa' cp Aqwa' iyupi'iyai' (iia(i)yiaml kill (distributive)- go-momentan-

   As impersonal object -t u'a-' seems to be used only indirectly after
-rjqi-, e. g.:

   (indef.)
nayu'q-vjiyqiiu'a{u)x u          fight-to-impersonal-when, when fighting

  These examples show that -yqi-i ua- generally denotes cooperation
with a group. Moreover, the two suffixes form a close unit, as they
occur before elements that would normally precede -t-u'a- alone (e. g.
-yw'ai- ΤΟ GO TO, narrative preterit -p 'iyai-, plural subject -q-a-);
see above examples.","[143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166]"
"   (1) COMPOUND N O U N S . Compound nouns are most easily classified
with reference to the nature of the first and second compounded terms.
Triple and quadruple compounds are always morphologically binary,
one or both of the terms being in turn compound. Thus, the examples
given above are to be analyzed as HORSE-TAIL + HAIR and BLOOD-
ROAST + ASK FOR. Nouns stems, particularly in initial position,
sometimes appear in abbreviated form; e. g. rii-n PERSON < ηϊψνϊ-',
na-n TRAIL < naywa-', pa-' WATER < pa·-*. For mo'o-' HAND is
sometimes usedTOO-»(cf. verb prefix ma-', § 20, 2). The qualifying
element regularly precedes. Noun compounds whose second ele-
ment is a participle or adjective, though logically substantival, are
morphologically best interpreted as either verbs (adjectives) with
incorporated noun subject or object (see 2, f below) or, more fre-
quently, participial derivatives of such verbs (adjectives).

In many cases the primary force is given by the second noun, the
first element of the compound merely modifying its range of signifi-

t h a t the noun referred to by the second element of the compound is
possessed by an understood or specified person, animal, or object
(cf. such English compounds as hunchback, i. e. HAVING A HUMPED

compound nouns are morphologically active or passive participles
of verbs with incorporated nominal subjects or objects respectively.
They function as true nouns nevertheless. Indeed, to only a slight
extent can the verbs be freely used with the incorporated noun sub-
jects, while participial derivatives of such verbs are very frequent.
Moreover, in some cases the participle of these compounds has taken
on a considerably specialized meaning, notably qari'-Ri SITTING
(plural yuywi'-tci), used in compounds to mean K N O L L , P E A K , ISLAND.
Examples of compounds in which the noun is morphologically a sub-
ject of the verb implied by the participle are:qaiva- mountain + avi'-ici lying              qa'iva vitci mountain-lying, pla-

  Rarely the noun is found detached from its participle, e. g. beside
objective pa-ya'rinA, pa'-qarinA   LAKE we have also paa'iA qari'nA
WATER (obj.) SITTING (obj.).
  Rather different from these examples in inner, if not outer, form
are compounds in which the participle is freely used in a substantival
sense. They are really ordinary noun + noun compounds, in which
the logical emphasis is on the second element. Examples are:W'qWi-nt'i stream (lit., flowing)           A'ta'n uxqwint'i sand stream (i. e.
                                              ""stream with sandy bed,"" not
                                              ""streaming, flowing sand"")
tAxqa 'ya^nt'i being flat, a ""flat""         A'ta'RA'qayanti sand-flat (not
                                              ""flat sand"")
   Very common are noun + participle compounds in which the noun
is to be thought of as the object of the verb back of the participle.
Here again the compound is functionally a noun, the logical emphasis
being generally placed on the first element. Examples are:to'o'ivi- bulrush + ora-n ani        my     to'o'ivioran an UR my-bulrush-
  digging, my dug-up ones                      dug it, the bulrushes that I

qutcu- buffalo, beef +          iya'-p'i    qu'tcu""iyap 'i dried beef

  Such examples differ in inner form from compounds in which the
noun is an ordinary incorporated noun object of an active participle,

(predicative) or participles of verbs (attributive). There are, how-
ever, a few cases of true adjectives with nominal suffixes (e. g.
-mp'i-, -tsi-) which, in compounds, follow the noun they qualify, e. g.:
qaru- house + itü-mp'i-     old        qam'itümp'i      house-old, old

  (d) Noun + verb compounds. Nouns which are compounded of
a noun stem and a bare verb (or adjective-verb) stem are extremely
uncommon. They seem to belong to the ""bahuvrihi"" type. Examples
are:

   Some adjectives may precede the nouns they qualify as independent
terms, e. g. also mi.a""pi-is· qa'ni LITTLE HOUSE.
  (h) Numeral + noun compounds.       These are very common and
comprise one of the typical methods of expressing numeral relations.
For examples see § 59, 2, b.
   (i) Pronoun + noun compounds.  These are quite rare, including
terms compounded with interrogative ini-' WHAT KIND OF, WHICH
and qima-' OTHER, which has certain pronominal peculiarities (see
§ 39, 2). Examples are:
in i-' what + fiyiv'i-      friend      'ini'ntciyivini     what friend of
                                           mine?
qima-' other + qani- house              qima'xanini       my other house
      qima- may also qualify as an independent pronoun, e. g. qima'ric u
qani'ni       MY OTHER HOUSE.      (j) Adverb + noun compounds.     These also are rare.     An example
is:
tanU'vwai-       far west               tanfi'vwaiuvwia<£i far-west songs,
                                          songs borrowed from western
                                           tribes
   (2) COMPOUND VERBS. Verbs compounded with other independent
stems, particularly verbs and nouns, are extremely common in Paiute.
Under compound verbs are, of course, to be included adjective-verbs
and participles.
    (a) Verb + verb compounds.     A great many verb stems may be
used as the second elements of compound verbs. As to their morpho-
logical force, they seem to fall into two groups, those whose action
is to be thought of as contemporaneous or coordinate with that of the
first verb stem (here belong particularly verbs of position and move-
ment) and those upon which the first verb stem logically depends
as a kind of object (e. g. τ ο WRITE-PRACTICE, TO PRACTICE WRITING).
                           X Southern Paiute and Ute
80                                  SAPIH
It is not easy to draw a sharp line between the two groups. Not a
few verb stems are used chiefly, if not entirely, as second elements of
compounds. Some have become specialized in a quasi-formal
significance (e. g. -paiy'i- το RETURN, also το HAVE JUST DONE SO
AND so).
   Among the former group are: -aid- το LIE (sing.); -m ia- SEVERAL GO,
T R A V E L , GO IN ORDER ΤΟ; -nuqwi- ΤΟ RUN, START OFF;       -nu'i-kai-
SEVERAL STAND; -pay(a)i- το W A L K , in compounds generally WHILE
ON ONE'S W A Y ; -pa(i)yi- ΤΟ RETURN, BACK;- pan-ay a- SEVERAL RETURN;
-pitci- ΤΟ ARRIVE; -pini- ΤΟ SEE, LOOK; -puru- ΤΟ GO ABOUT, FROM
PLACE TO PLACE (cf. independent poro- SEVERAL J O U R N E Y ) ; -qa- το
SING; -qari- το SIT (sing.); -qwavi- SEVERAL LIE; -kmpa-        το HIT;
-waywi SEVERAL STAND; -w'in'i- το STAND (sing.); -yuywi- SEVERAL
SIT. Examples are:-avi-     to lie                        ψιι'ανιχα'     while thus-do-lying,

   Such a second verb-stem needs only to drop out of independent
usage to take on the appearance of a suffix. This step has undoubt-
edly been taken more than once (see § 28).
   Under the rubric of verb + verb compounds are to be included
also compounds of adjective-verb stem and verb stem and of adjective-

(not merely adjective-verb stems), including participles, and verbs
(or participles) are quite uncommon, except for compounds whose
first element is 'a't iGOOD, e. g.            ""'a'ttmpu'tcu'tcuywaplya'aikwA
                               a           x

HEARD IT CORRECTLY, CLEARLY; ""'a'iiwa'atjintci              GOOD-SHOUTING,
GOOD SHOUTER.      I t is remarkable t h a t in most of these examples
""'a't-i-"" and the following verb are treated as accentually distinct,
i. e. the law of alternating stresses is broken. The doublets -τιαη-
qa'p'iya'aikwA    and -ncCtjqApiya'aikwA shows the struggle between
the force of analogy of the simplex and the regular operation of the
phonetic law.   (c) Pronoun + verb compounds.    Independent personal pronouns
are not compounded with verbs. Under this heading, however, are
included verbs compounded with quasi-pronominal qima- OTHER
(see § 39, 2) and verbs compounded of independent personal pronoun
+ -nc u'ai-n a 'ai- τ ο PAY NO ATTENTION TO. Examples are:qima-   other                           qim a'ntcikwa-rywa'* shall not be
                                           mixed up with others
-nc u'ai-n a 'ai- to pay no atten-      niru'c u'ain a·'"" pay no attention
   tion to                                 to me; αηα'mcu ain a 'a pay no
                                           attention to him  The latter examples are just as readily explainable as verbalized
pronoun + postposition (see § 50, 4, 29).

An example of a verb compounded with naijwa""""qu-n BOTH (objec-
tive in form) is naT)wa""""q umpAxqayu ΤΟ KILL BOTH (i. e. to guess
correctly both bone-positions in hand game).
   (e) Adverb + verb compounds. T h e adverbs here referred to m a y
occur also independently. There is no real line of demarcation
between them and specialized adverbial prefixes (§ 20). Examples
are:
nava'cu-      in vain                     nam'cup-A'qayu        to kill in vain
                                              (note accentual irregularity,
                                              cf. b above).

   (f) Noun + verb compounds.       These comprise examples of w h a t
is ordinarily known as noun incorporation. T h e absolutive or
classificatory suffix of the noun is frequently lost in noun-verb com-
pounds. The syntactic relation implied between the verb and its
incorporated noun may be of various sorts. T h e incorporated noun
may be an instrument; it may indicate similarity; it m a y function
as a direct object; it may have local significance; it may function
as the subject of the verb; it may be a predicate of the subject; or it
may be a predicate of the object. Any of these relations may be,
and more often is, expressed by properly syntactic or morphological
processes. I t is not possible to give a simple rule as to when noun
incorporation is possible or required, whether, e. g., to say Ι TRAIL-
SEEK or Ι SEEK A TRAIL. There is a good deal of option in this matter,
but m a n y cases of incorporation are fixed by idiomatic usage. There
is some tendency to express what might be called characteristic or
generalized relations by syntactic means. Any general and valid
rule, however, is hardly to be formulated.     (o) An instrumental     function is illustrated in:

"                            § 53. Internal stem changes.
  Verbal stem changes in Paiute that are of morphological signifi-
cance may be classified under the heads of reduplication (see § 58,3-6),
vocalic modification, and consonantal affection. Only the two latter
are discussed at this point.
   (1) VOCALIC ALTERNATIONS. Vocalic alternations are either quanti-
tative or qualitative, the former, insofar as they are of morphological

significance, being relatively infrequent. In all, six types of vocalic
alternation may be recognized.
   (a) Vocalic lengthening. A short vowel may be lengthened, a long
one over-lengthened (e. g. a· to a-a), to indicate the idea of I N V A I N ,
TO NO EFFECT, e .    g.:qa'aplya'    sang to no effect ( < qa - to sing)
'a'aip'iya'   said without effect ( < ai- to say)
α'τηραχαΐ     talks to no purpose ( < ατηρα'χαϊ talks)
'o 'n'niy'uq WA did it (inv.) in vain ( < un Crfitq-WA did it)
These examples indicate that it is regularly the first vowel of the
word which is lengthened.
  Another group of cases of vocalic lengthening seems to be associated
with the idea of continuation. Examples are not very numerous:
pini rjw'in-q n uq WLXw'aim'arjWA look-stand about (-yw'ino- < -Tjwln-'L-
   to stand, assimilated by following -n vq tt>t-)-run-go-future-him
   (inv.), shall go to stand around looking for him
Uni ' ^ u ' u m i do ( < t{m-)-subordinating-them (inv.), while they 2
   were so doing
po'to'qwa-       to be spherical: pSts'i]'i'kai- to be spherical
tsi 'tsnjwayaip iyain C it seemed that (arrows) were stuck in in
   several places (lengthened from normal reduplicated tsit si- >
   tstsi'-)
  Perhaps ma'ni-campa-              BARELY is similarly lengthened from
mani'-campa- T H A T - W A Y - O N L Y , ONLY IN THAT WAY, e. g.:
uvwa""axl    ma-^ni'campA    ya'aqwipiya'                 it   (inv.)-over   barely
  entered, barely escaped by going over it
  (b) Vocalic alternation to indicate number (and voice). In certain
verbs, the final vowel is a, a·, o, or u in the intransitive singular, i in
the intransitive plural and in the transitive. Examples are:
topa-qi-   (tree, feather, tooth)          iivi-trai-several come loose; -top i-
  comes loose                                 n'na-       to pluck out one;
                                              -tovi-tca- to pluck out several
qap a-q-i- to stop (intr.)                 qavi-tcai- several stop; qavi-tca-
                                              to stop several

paya-q i-, paq a-q i- to tear (intr.)      pay(a)i-tcai- several tear (intr.),
                                              are worn out; -paqi-n'na- to

   ized bv -ijqi-, § 29, 10)   (c) Vocalic alternation to indicate aspect. In a few cases a final
-a- vowel of the stem when used iteratively (or continuatively) con-
trasts with an -i- of the stem when used semelfactively, e. g.:
up-vq-(w)i-      to bounce (once)              ovwoq(w)a-y(s)i-  to bounce up
                                                  and down

   30,3)                                         30,1)   (d) Vocalic alternation to indicate active {-a·-) and mcdio-passive or
static (-<-). A very considerable number of verb stems alternate in
their final vowel between α• and i, a smaller number between ya-
and i. The former form of the stem is used for the active intransitive
(or transitional) voice, the latter for the medio-passive, static, or
resultative voice. The i- forms seem to be durative, the a - forms
tend to be momentaneous. Examples are:
i -p otsin'i-l- ai- to be ready to             potsin'na - to start off (for a race)
   start off
muntun'ni- to lie covered up                   muntmia·- to lie down and cover

appreciable difference in meaning between the i- and a- forms,
though this may be due to inadequate translation, e. g.:tcuywi-    to approach (tr.)           tcuywu-     dit.
rin'i-  to be frightened, surprised    nri'ya•-    dit.   (e) Alternation of transitional -i- and static -a -. This type, ap-
parently the exact opposite of the preceding, is sparsely represented,
e. g.:
pono'a•-     to be full                jano'i-    to become full   ( f ) Alternation of intransitive -i-, -a - and transitive -a-. In these
verbs it Ls difficult to discover the difference in meaning between
the -i- and -a - forms (cf. d above). In some cases only -i- alternates
with -a-. T h e alternation of -i- and -a- is evidently an old Uto-Aztekan
feature; cf. such Xahuatl doublets as cotoni τ ο BREAK (intr.): cotona
τ ο WOUND, CUT; tomi τ ο OPEN UP (intr.): toma τ ο OPEN (tr.), DELIVER;
and numerous others. Paiute examples are:tuywi-,tuywa-   fire goes out          tuywa-   to put out a fire

vised from intransitives in -a- or as built on -α- transitives with
lengthened vowel before   (2) CONSONANTAL AFFECTION. Two groups of cases are to be
recognized, glottalization and gemination of stem consonants. These
seem to be equivalent processes. Not infrequently they occur to-
gether in the same form, e. g. tska'pin'NA το CUT (momentaneously):
ts-kaniNA το CUT (duratively).
   (a) Glottalization of verb stems. This process operates:      1. To indicate distribution, e. g.:
fVA'tcü'ywiyuni      four                    wa'a'yWAtcÜTjwiyun C eight (lit.,
                                               four here and there)
waijwi-   several stand                      wa'a'rjwituip'iya' caused (them)
                                               each to stand
yun a- to put several down (in               yuna'(a)i-     to put down in sev-
  one place)                                   eral places
      2. To indicate iteration, e. g.:
iyon a- to carry in one's arms               iyan'na- to carry several times
ya-vayai-   to fear                          yi'i-p-aq ai- to be afraid several
                                                times (note irregular change of
                                                -a - to -Ϊ -)     3. To indicate momentaneous activity, e. g. -n'na- momentaneous
transitive with singular object: -n a- durative transitive with singular
object (§ 30, 4).
   Glottalization alone as a grammatical process is relatively rare.
Generally it accompanies distributive or iterative reduplication (see
§ 58, 3 and 4), less often gemination alone (see b).
   (b) Gemination in verb stems. Gemination primarily denotes
momentaneous activity; the contrast between momentaneous and
durative, as might be expected, tends to become one of singularity
and plurality. Gemination is very commonly employed with the
momentaneous suffixes -q i- (§ 30, 3) and -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c). Other
examples of momentaneous gemination are:

-ya- durative suffix (§ 30, 1)           -qi- momentaneous suffix (§ 30,3)
   Far less frequently gemination indicates iterative activity, e. g.:
qaqafi-     to run away                  qaqat'i-    to run away several
                                           times
ya-vayai-     to fear                    yV'i-paqai-   to be afraid several
                                           times
   Even these examples are really but special forms of gemmation
accompanying reduplication. Combined gemination and reduplica-
tion, to indicate distribution or iteration, is common (see § 58, 3, h;
§ 58, 4, a, d, f).
                        § 54. Singular and. plural stems.
   All verbs are determined as regards singularity or plurality of the
subject, less often of the object also; the singular form includes
reference to the dual. The most common method of indicating
plurality of the subject is by the use of the suffix -q a- (§ 31, 1, c); for
other suffixes indicating or implying plurality of subject or object, see
§ 31, 1, a and b; § 3 1 , 2 , a-d. Vocalic alternation of the final vowel of
the stem is also sometimes associated with change of number (see § 53,
1, b). The idea of distribution expressed by reduplication often passes
over into that of plurality of the subject or object (see § 58, 3).
   Besides these formal methods of expressing number, there are
certain verb stems that are inherently limited in their reference to
number, the singular-dual of the intransitive subject or transitive
object being expressed by a stem which is etymologically distinct

from that for the plural of the intransitive subject or transitive object.

    Several of these verb stems are also used as the second element
in compound verbs. T h e whole verb may be characterized as singular
or plural in this w a y ; a pluralizing -q a- may thus become unnecessary,
e. g. ivi- O N E D R I N K S : im-k a- S E V E R A L D R I N K , but ivi-ywin-'i- O N E
DRINKS S T A N D I N G : iviywaywi- S E V E R A L DRINK S T A N D I N G .     Singularity
or plurality of the object is not disturbed by composition, e. g.

  A small number of singular and plural verb stems are used only
as second elements in verb compounds, e. g.:
-kwa'{a)i-    one goes (see § 28, 1;    -m ia- several go (less frequently
   practically suffix)                     used as independent stem)
-ya'(a)i-    to die (independent        -tupi-, -tupa-      (only in com-
  stem), e. g. tiyii-ya'ai- to die of      pounds; perhaps identical with
  hunger, to be hungry                     tup i- to be used up), e. g.
                                           fiyvi-tcupi- several are hungry,
                                           naya-ntupa- several get angry
uxqu'mpu-tcaq ai-      one (thing)      uTqu' mpu-tcdcai-xw' ai-     several
  goes off in dust                         (things) go up in dust
  The plural -namtci- το BECOME (perhaps reciprocal no-® +             pitci-
TO ARRIVE: TO ARRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER, TO GET TO BE AMONG
THEMSELVES) either corresponds to singular -tiqay'wi- (also used
independently) το BECOME or is used as a verbal quasi-suffix of
plurality, e. g.:
qatcutiqarj'wi-    to not-become,       qatcvn avitci- several get tired out
   one gets tired out
pat.caqwi- one is (or gets) wet         patcaq winavitci- several get wet
tuywi- fire goes out                    tuywinavitci- fires go out                            § 55. Verb syntax.
 Under this head may be conveniently grouped a number of pheno-
mena that affect the verb in relation to other words in the sentence.
   ( 1 ) SUBORDINATING ELEMENTS.      Subordinate clauses, denoting
cause, time, condition, concession, or attendant circumstance, are
extremely frequent in Paiute. Those of these clauses that are used
with logical subjects put them in the objective form. Thus, a
sentence like WHEN I CAME, YOU WERE AWAY is rendered WHEN ME
CAME, YOU WERE AWAY.       In all probability the objective is in these
cases to be interpreted genitivelv, the subordinating element as a
specialized postposition; e. g. AT MY COMING, YOU WERE AWAY.
This receives some support from the fact that a few of the ordinary
postpositions may be suffixed to verb forms (see 2 below). However,
of the verb-subordinating elements only -yu- (see c below), possibly
also -qu- (see e), is employed also with nouns (see § 50, 4, 49). The

      244                                      SAPIR
      tense elements -pa·- (§ 32, 4) and -q-ai- (§ 32, 3) may precede the
      subordinating suffix, but not the other tense elements. Five sub-
      ordinating suffixes are found, the first three of which introduce
      clauses referring to the subject of the main clause, the other two
      clauses with a different subject.
         (a) -tsi- gerund. Subordinates in -tsi- are here termed gerunds
      because they have no expressed subject, though they may have an
      object. Their logical subject is always the same as that of the main
      clause. They indicate antecedent circumstance or activity and
      are most appropriately translated in English by participial phrases:
      HAVING — E D .   I t is at least possible that the gerund -i st.- is etymologi-
      cally related to the animate noun suffix -tsi- (§ 24, 1, f); such a sentence
      as HAVING so DONE, H E RETURNED would then originally have meant
      THE ONE WHO DID so RETURNED.             Examples are:      maa'iisiyw imi'ywa'aiijiVA pa(i)yi'kiva'   find-gerund-him   (inv.) thou-
          with-him (inv.) return-hither-will; having found him with you, (he)
          will come home
      %nik mjum'its· min i's-'its mjwa'i-uikaijupiya'     after having so done
          (plur.), having returned, (they) caused (it) to rain
      iini'ts·, %ni'Tjuts• having so done, then (frequently used as sentence
          connector); uniyutsiyiVA    then he (inv.)
      rii' non-o'cC qwiya'tcitciqarfwds-       I dream-present bear-become-
          gerund, I dream that I turned into a bear
        Future gerunds in -va t-si-, -vipatsi- BEING ABOUT TO—are also
      very common and frequently found in idiomatic turns. Examples
      are:
      axa'ny-kava     (sL7jwar)w a'l-kaV    h o w - d o - p l u r a l - f u t u r e - g e r u n d - h i m (inv.)-

         (b) -kai- W H E N , WHILE, AS; appears as spirantized -yai- or nasalized

      whose subject is the same as that of the main verb. While -t si-

of action. Examples are:sv'vw'ar)WA qari'm'miuxa' t'(ψνϊ'ιυα if (§ 60, 2, d)-he (inv.) sit-move-as

   -kai-c-u- (with enclitic -cu-; see § 19, 2, k) often implies immediate
sequence: AS SOON AS, e. g.:
a'iiaic-u άηα'ψΰαφι quna'manti wTqa'm'Mi'kaipiya'               say-as-just
   coyote fire-at-being (obj.) covered; as soon as Coyote said so, (he)
   covered some of (the) fire  Concessive clauses of the same subject as the main clause are
formed by appending -c-ampa- (§ 19, 2, j) to -kai-, e. g.:iya'xaxayqaic ampa yA though fearing him (vis.), (he went to meet
   him)
   (c) -yu- WHEN, WHILE, AS. This subordinating suffix seems to
be identical in meaning with -kai- (see b above). I t is suffixed only
to stems or verb suffixes ending in -ai-. I t always replaces -kai- after
verb suffixes ending in -ai- (e. g. resultative subordinate -q-ai-yu-
WHEN SAYING, not *-q-ai-yai-).       After verb stems in -ai, -kai- is
used (e. g. ai-yai- WHILE SAYING), unless followed by enclitic -c-ampa-,
but not, e. g., -cu- (hence ai-yai-c u-, but ai-yu-c ampa-).   Examples
of -yu- clauses are:niijwl'xaiyu' n'ni person-be-as-thou do! act like a person!
naijqa'q ai'yvq IVA when (he) heard it (inv.)   Clauses in -yu-cu-, analogous to those in -kai-c-u- and -ku-c-u-,
are found after verbal suffixes in -ai-, e. g.:•Uni'k-aiyvc u un""i'k-upiya do-resultative-as-just fall-momentaneous-
  past; while so doing, (he) fell down   Concessive clauses in -yu-c ampa- replace forms in -kai-c ampa-
after all verbs in -ai-, e. g.:

temporaneity of action. Examples are:

phonetic group or 'Svord,"" the independent or enclitic element being
either subjective or objective. Thus, instead of saying i'mi pAxqa'-

the subject of a subordinate clause, the second its object, e. g.:

192                             SAPIR             § 41. Combinations of enclitic pronouns.
   Enclitic pronouns are often combined, the union of two such pro-
nouns being extremely common, that of three not at all rare. The
order of elements is rigidly determined by form, not by function (e. g.
-atjani- HE-ME, I-HIM, I-HIS, HIS-ME, MY-HIM, HE-MY). The resulting
theoretical ambiguities are generally resolved by the context, partic-
ularly as the pleonastic usages already referred to (§ 40, 5) give
opportunity for further limitation of the syntactical possibilities.
Thus, rii' -ayanl can only mean I-HIM or I-HIS; -aijani -ni (verb form)
can hardly mean anything but HE-ME. The following table gives a
survey of combinations of two enclitic pronouns; the horizontal entries
are subjective, the vertical objective. As a rule the pronominal ele-
ments are preserved intact, but certain modifications need to be
noted.
   The combined forms listed in the table apply not only to combina-
tions of subject and object of the same verb but to all other combina-
tions of subjective and objective, including possessive, forms. The
table also includes combinations of objective + objective enclitics,
insofar as objective forms are identical with subjective forms; e. g.
-ιaija'ami- HE-THEE, HE-THY applies also to HIM-THEE, HIM-THY, HIS-
THEE. Special double objective forms are:
-'mini- thee-me, me-thee
-Tjumini- you (obj.)-me, me-you (obj.)
-miriimu'i- thee-us (also us-thee, we-thee)
-rjuminimwi- you (obj.)-us (also us-you, we-you)
   (1) MORPHOLOGY OF COMBINED FORMS. The following rules are
followed in the combination of enclitic pronouns:
   (a) The combination of the first person singular subject and the
second person object, which should theoretically result in -mini-
and -Tjumini-, is simplified to - mi- and -tjumi- (properly THEE and
YOU OBJ.), the first person being thus merely implied.
   (b) The second person singular subjective element (-') always
follows an element of the first or third person, also the objective form
of the second person.
   (c) In all combinations of the first and second persons but those
coming under (b), the second personal element precedes (e. g. -rjw'ini-
YE-ME, -mini-    THEE-ME).
   (d) In combinations of the third person with either the first or
second person, the element referring to the third person precedes.
Note, however, -τμνϊ'ϊηιϊ- YE-THEM (INV.).

194                                    SAPIR   (e) In combinations of the third person, the singular animate
precedes the plural animate, while the animate is always preceded
by the inanimate. Furthermore, two a- vowels coming together in
composition do not contract to a- but to a' (or 'a); e. g. -αηα'ηα- <
-arja—|—arja-, -aq aya- < -aq a- -\—aya-.        "" N u m b e r dissimilation""
(cf. § 40, 4) takes place when two animate plurals are combined,
the first enclitic becoming singular in form; hence -auf ami- < -ami-
ami- as well as -aya-ami-, -ywa'm'i- < - mi-mi- as well as -rywa-mi-.
Such a form as -am'i'm'i- THEY 2-THEM (vi3.) is compounded of -am'i-
and animate dual      . . .mi-. A visible enclitic element is never com-
bined with an invisible one (e. g. -aya'ywa- is impossible). Should it
be necessary to contrast a visible subject or object with an invisible
one, recourse must be had to the separation of the subject and object,
e . g . uywa'c'uqw    ivi'van-ia-q-A    HE     (INV.)-IT   (INV.)   DRINK-WILL-IT
(VIS.), HE (INV.) WILL DRINK IT ( V I S . ) ; in combined form only           ivi'va·-
n iaAxqa'aijA   HE (VIS.) WILL DRINK IT (VIS.) o r                  ivi'vaniaqwa'ayiVA
H E (INV.) WILL DRINK IT (INV.) are possible.   (f) The objective reflexive possessive -v'i- has not been included in
the table. I t does not seem to combine with elements of the first
and second persons. I t is very frequently combined with enclitic
elements of the third person, which it follows: -ayavi-, -ywavi-,
-amivi-, -m'iv'i-, -aqav'i-, -qwav'i-.  I t precedes the animate dual,
however: -vi'imi-.
   (g) T h e animate dual, which is regularly subjective, follows all
third personal elements, including -vi- (see f above), but apparently
precedes the enclitics of the first and second persons. D a t a , however,
are quite imperfect for the latter cases. I t m a y be noted once more
that subjective animate plurals of the third person function as duals
if the verb is singular in form.","[207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212]"
"   Before subordinating -qu- (§55, 1, e), -q ai- appears as -q a - (cf. §26,
1, a and b; § 30, 9); e. g. yaa'iyqw' aikaqoajjA AFTER HE HAD GONE OUT
HUNTING. For perfective participial -qanti-, see § 25, 6, d. Though
perfectly analogous in treatment to resultative -q ai- (§ 30, 9) and
perhaps etymologically related to it, it is in practice felt as a distinct
element, as shown by the occurrence of -q aijc ai- resultative-per-
fective, e. g.:tayo'isidiui-  to cause to cover        tjyj'tsidiuk-aik a had (evident-
   over on top                             ly) been caused to cover over
                                           on top   The perfective idea frequently takes on an inferential implication.
An explicit inferential present-perfect (HAS EVIDENTLY -ED) is formed
by combining perfective -q ai- with present -yi-: -q aiy'i-. In general
it seems that perfective -q ai- regularly implies lack of direct knowl-
edge on the part of the speaker, differing in this respect from enclitic
-(n)tca- (§ 19, 1, a). Examples of inferential -q-ai{yi)- are:ivi-   to drink                         ivi'k-aip-l   what was evidently
                                            drunk (by someone)

    (4) -va •-"", -mpa-n future, intentive. In ordinary indicative forms
this element generally adds an intentive or hortatory force to its
fundamental future significance (contrast -va n ia-, -mpania-         below,
5). In other forms, such as gerunds in -Ut- (§ 55, 1, a) and participles
(§ 25, 6, b), it seems to indicate mere futurity. I t is used also in simple
future statements that are conditional on other acts. Examples of

below) or dubitative -vi -, -mpi- (see § 33, 2). The former, -va p 'iyai-
(-mpa p 'iyai-), indicates an act in the past looking towards the
future. Examples are:

regularly employed in mythical narrative. Narrative referring to a
relatively recent past makes use of enclitic -ywa- (§ 19, 1, b). With-
out doubt -p 'iyai- is compounded of past passive participial -p'i-
(§ 25, 5, b) and verbalizing -yai- το HAVE (§ 26, 1, b). This is shown
partly by the fact that -p 'iyai- is treated analogously to -yai- (e. g.
participial -p 'iyanfi-, § 25, 6, e; negative -p 'i'ai-, § 57, 2, c), partly by
the fact that -p 'i- and -yai- may become disconnected (e. g. -ρ ϊ-a-yai-,
see 8 below, diminutive -p 'i-tsi-yai-). Hence a form like a'ip 'iya'
SAID is     to    be   analyzed   as   SAY-PAST PASSIVE PARTIC.-HAVE,    HAS
SAID. In other words, Paiute -p-'iyai- forms are formally the synthetic
analogues of English perfects; the functions do not quite correspond
in the two languages, however.
  Examples of -p-'iyai- are:qan-   to sit, dwell                       qan'p-ϊyaK sat, dwelt, qari'p i-

p'iya'      WENT RIGHT INTO IT.  (7) -p-'iay'i- HAS B E E N -ED. This passive narrative past is evidently
compounded of past passive participial -ρ Ϊ- (§ 25, 5, b), possessive
-a-      (§ 2 4 , 2 , a ) , a n d p r e s e n t -yi-   (1 a b o v e ) ,   τ ο HAVE B E E N   KILLED
(BY ONE), therefore, as expressed by -piay'i-, seems literally to mean
το BE ONE'S KILLED ONE. I t seems to differ from the normal passive
narrative past (-t'ip-'iyai-) in more definitely implying an agent
and perhaps also in referring to a continued state in the present.
Examples are:pA'qa'yu-            to kill                              pAxqa'i}Up'iai' was killed (long

sort, compounded of narrative past -p 'iyai-, impersonal -t ua-, and
present -yi-, have been already referred to (§ 29, 14). What difference
there is between the -p 'iyai- and the -p 'iayai- forms with possessive
-a- (§ 24, 2, a) is not clear. As for the use of the present -y'i-, it is
very likely that the -yai- of -p 'iyai-, when final, is to be understood as

168                               SAPIRincluding a reference to present time (cf. lack of -y'i- after -yai- το
h a v e , § 26, 1, b, which implicitly refers to present time) and that this
implied -y'i- needs to be expressed after an inserted -t-mo-. In other
words, -yai- and -yai-y'i- have fallen together to -yai-, but -yait uay'i-
remains as such. Examples are:

                          § 33. Modal suffixes.
  There are only two specifically modal verb suffixes. Most modal
ideas, as we have seen, are expressed by the aid of enclitics (§ 19, 2).
The indicative has no special modal suffix; for the imperative, see §
52. For perfective -qai- as inferential, see § 32, 3.
   (1) -yv-, (-qv-,) -T)qv- irrealis. This element indicates that the
activity expressed by the verb is unreal, i. e. either merely potential
or contrary to fact (potential in past time). In the latter case it is
preceded by perfective -q ai- (§ 32, 3) or narrative past -p 'iyai- (§
32, 6). I t is not used with present -yi- nor, it would seem, with future
-va·-71, -mpa-n.   Optative examples (WOULD THAT . . . . ! ) involving
enclitic -γα' followed by 'oai' have been already given (§ 19, 2, b).
Further examples of the irrealis are:
pay'i'k-w3 'αίχναηαχα      'oai' go-away-irrealis-he-then! he ought to
    go away!
ni' narja'i'aik a yA yaya'x Aqai%.u I anger-die-if-he cry (momentan-

urjwa'rjuqv'q waxa' 'oai' would that it might rain! (-g·«·- perhaps
    dissimilated from -tjqv)
a

            SOUTHERN P A I U T E , A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE              169
  The irrealis may be participialized by means of -p i-. Participial
-kvp-'i- is frequently used as a base in optative forms with enclitic
-cuyaywa . . . n oa- (§ 19, 2, h). Other examples of its use are:
'α'ίρηχυ ρ- ur uru""ai' good-would-participle it is, it would be good
   (somewhat as though one were to say H E IS A POSSIBLE SINGER
   instead of H E WOULD SING)
uru""axw' sv""aiyuxvp i be-would very-good-would-participle, (it)
   would be extremely good
piywa'royoq-o p lni (-qo•- < -yqo -'ί) my would-be-made-as-wife, I
   would take her as my wife (song form)
   A past participial irrealis, -kvpiyanii-, is also found, e. g.: pAxqq/-
urjqυυ""p'iyanfini who would have killed me
  (2) -vi·-, -mp'i·- dubitative. The dubitative verb suffix is fre-
quently accompanied in the same or a preceding word by an enclitic -'
(§ 19, 2, n). I t may be rendered as PERHAPS, IT MAY (MIGHT) B E
THAT . . . Future dubitatives in -vamp'i·- (-mpa mpl -) are common
but, so far as known, the dubitative suffix is not employed with other
tense suffixes. Examples of -vi -, -mp'i·- are:ίνί'νϊ   maybe (he) is drinking; ivi'vl·''1 maybe thou art drinking
   (didst drink); ivi'jf arn 'rar/wa'"" maybe we did drink
an iaxwan a'ivT qa'ya' what-preterit-I say-perhaps sing- subordin-

qwa 'yuiuava mpini they (impers.) will perhaps beat me, it seems I
   shall get beaten                    § 34. Order of verbal elements.
  At this point we may conveniently take up the question of the
order in which occur the various elements that build up a verb form.
Four main positions are to be recognized: prefix, verbal theme,
suffix (prevailingly formal in character), and enclitic. Each of these
positions may consist of more than one element. On the other
                         X Southern Paiute and Ute
170                                   SAPIEhand, only the second position is necessarily filled, though ordinarily
one or more elements of the third position follow. The order of
elements within each of the four fundamental positions is, for the
most part, rigorously determined. Fifteen positions may be recog-
nized within the third, though, needless to say, only a limited number
of combinations among these are intrinsically possible. The following
scheme will be useful for reference (the letters and numbers indicate
order of position):
  A. Prefix
    1. Adverbial prefix (§ 20)
    2. Reflexive prefix (§ 22)
    3. Instrumental prefix (§ 21)
  B. Verbal theme
    1. (a) Verb stem (or other stem if followed by Β 2); or (b) combi-
       nation of stems, last of which is necessarily verbal (unless Β 2
       follows) (§ 18, 2)>
    2. Verbalizing suffix (§ 26)
  C. Suffix
    1. Suffixes of voice and aspect: -ya- (§ 30, 1); -yi- (§ 30, 2);
       -qi- (§ 30,3); -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c); -wo- (§ 31, 2, b); -tea- (§ 31, 2, d)
    2. -tcai- (§ 31, 2, a)
    3. Causative -f-ui- (§ 29, 12)
    4. Indirective (or transitivizing) -rjqi- (§ 29, 11)
    5. Pluralizing suffixes: -qa- (§ 31, 1, c); -'ψνα- (§ 31, 1, a); -t-'i-
       (§31, 1, b)
    6. Suffixes of movement (§ 28); continuative -n'ni- (§ 30, 12)
    7. Momentaneous suffixes: -iju- (§ 30, 5); -qu- (§ 30, 7)
    8. Resultative -qai- (§ 30, 9); passive -t'i- (§ 29, 13)
    9. Perfective -q ai- (§ 32, 3); usitative -mia-, -mi-n (§ 30, 10);
       -ml- (§ 30, 13). -m i-"" precedes -q ai-.
   10. Future -pa - (§ 32, 4), -pan-ia (§ 32, 5; -n-ia- probably best
       considered as belonging to position 14)
   1
     A 2 (or A 3) + Β 1 (a) + Β 2 may, however, be taken as unit and com-
pounded with preceding (non-verbal) or following (verbal) stem.          Indeed,
this extended verbal "" t h e m e "" m a y also include elements (chiefly 1 - 4 ) be-
longing to position C. It is difficult to give rules, as composition takes place
whenever two or more elements or groups of elements are felt as logically
combinable or psychologically equivalent. Composition thus s o m e w h a t
 breaks in on our order scheme.

   12. Narrative past -p'iyai- (§ 32, 6), which may be split into
       its component elements by possessive -a- (§ 24, 2, a) or diminu-
       tive -tsi- (§ 35)
   13. Impersonal -{-ua- (§ 29, 14)
   14. Tense and modal elements: present -yi- (§ 32, 1); present
       -qa- (§ 32, 2); modal -lev- (§ 33, 1); dubitative -pi- (§ 33, 2)
   15. Syntactic elements, embracing:
       (a) Nominalizing suffixes (§ 25); or
       (b) Subordinating suffixes (§ 55, 1)
  D. Enclitic, occurring in nine positions, one of which, no. 7, may in
     turn be subdivided into three positions (see § 19, 4; § 4 1 , 1 and 4)   There is some doubt as to the priority of certain positions in C;
thus, it may be t h a t 10 and 11 should be reversed or, as probably
mutually exclusive elements, grouped together. Aside from doubts
of this sort, there are a number of disturbances of the above scheme
introduced by the impersonal -iua- and the passive -t-'i·-. First of
all, when -( ua- is used as indirect object of indirective -r/qi-, it follows
position 4 and precedes position 5 (see § 29, 14). Secondly, -tua-
regularly precedes future -pa-(nia-)         (position 10), yet follows
position 12. Thirdly, the position of pluralizing -qa- (no. 5), which
regularly precedes e. g. momentaneous -rju- (position 7), is disturbed
in impersonal and passive forms. In these cases it falls between
positions 8 and 9, i. e. it follows passive -t-'i - but precedes perfective
-q ai- and impersonal -( ua-. Thus, with normal ivik arjuy'i- SEVERAL

KILLED and &v i'r)iiq{w)at-u'ayi- THEY (PLUR. IMPERS.) ASK.           Lastly,
impersonal -( ua- follows subordinating -Icu- (see § 55, 1, e) in spite of
the fact that subordinating suffixes (C, 15, b) regularly follow all
other verbal suffixes.
   I t will not be necessary here to give examples testing out the order
scheme, as they can be readily found by the reader among the numer-
ous verb forms scattered in this paper. The positions assumed by
diminutive -ist-, which seems to be treated rather irregularly, will
be referred to in § 35, 2.","[182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"
"   (2) VERBS OF SAYING. The corresponding generalized usage of
verbs of saying finds less ready analogy in English. First of all,
ai-, particularly in its usitative form, frequently means το MEAN,
TO REFER το rather than literally το SAY, e. g.:a'inicu'a ij 'a'imi that-interrogative-he (vis.) say-usitative, is that
     what he is wont to say? he does not mean that
i'i'ijai a'imi-ka' this (anim.)-obj. sav-usitative-perfective, has been
    always referring to this one   F o r ai-   . . .nia-   τ ο THINK, s e e § 19, 2, d .
  Examples of ai- as generalized verb of sound and mental operation,
the precise nature of the reference being clear from the context, are:Mi iy'ir 'a'imi I indeed am wont to say = always have that dream
aya'n iyidsiTjiv a'ik-.i what-do-momentaneous-gerund-he (inv.) says,
  what happened to him that he says so? = what has happened to

  the same manner = (everything that is) there (at the house) will
  be making the same sounds as ordinarily (so that people will not
  know it has been abandoned)   A number of verbs of sound or mental operation consist of ai- το

"   (2) ENCLISIS. By enclisis is meant the suffixing of certain ele-
ments to any word in the sentence, the resulting complex constituting
a firm phonetic, but not a strictly formal, unit. Enclitic elements,
except for some of the pronouns, never occur in other than enclitic
form. In a ""word"" like ivi'rjunicar dam DID I T A K E A DRINK? The
preterital -ntca-, the interrogative -r'oa-, and the pronominal -ηι I
are enclitic elements, not true suffixes, the true ""word,"" formally
speaking, consisting only of ivi'yu- ΤΟ T A K E A DRINK (ivi- ΤΟ DRINK
+ momentaneous suffix -iju-). This is shown by the fact that the
enclitic cluster -(n)tcar'oam can be appended, without bringing about
any strictly formal modifications, to a preceding word in the sentence;
e. g. qan i'va tcar'oan ivi'yu H O U S E - A T - P R E T E R I T - I N T E R R O G A T I V E - I
DRINK- MOMENTANEOUS, DID I DRINK AT THE HOUSE?                                 Phonetically
the form DID-1-AT-THE-HOUSE? is a perfect unit, morphologically it
is a word (qan i'-va - HOUSE-AT) plus a number of exteriorly segmented
elements that have no independent existence. Enclisis is thus neither
true suffixation nor juxtaposition of independent elements. I t has
the external characteristics of the former (including strict adherence
to certain principles of order), the inner feeling of the latter. I t is
one of the most characteristic processes of Paiute, doubtless of
                 Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean          Language
             SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN               LANGUAGE                71
Plateau Shoshonean generally. Enclitics include pronominal ele-
ments (see § 40) and elements of temporal and adverbial force (see
§ 19).
    (3) PREFIXATION (see § 20). A considerable number of elements
is prefixed to stems; they consist chiefly of adverbial elements and
instrumental prefixes. They have purely derivational, not formal,
significance. In origin they are doubtless, at least in large part,
independent stems that have lost their individuality and now appear
only as first elements of compounds (with qu-a BY M E A N S O F F I R E ,
e.' g., cf. independent qun a- F I R E ) .
   ( 4 ) S I I F F I X A T I O . V (see § § 2 3 - 3 7 ) . This is the most important
grammatical process of all. Under suffixes are included both deriva-
tional elements (e. g. agentive -vi-n, -mpi-n) and elements of strictly
formal significance (e. g. objective -a-, -ya-\ verb subordinating -yai-,
-q ai-, -rjqai-).
   (5) REDUPLICATION (see § 58). As a formal process reduplication
is always initial. Final reduplication occurs only in isolated words
and has no formal or derivational function. There are several
distinct types of reduplication. The ideas expressed by the process
are chiefly those of distribution, iteration and momentaneous activity
  (6) C O N S O N A N T A L C H A N G E S . These are quite apart from the
mechanical changes undergone by consonants in composition (§ 16).
Consonantal changes include:
   (a) Gemination of stem consonants (see § 53, 2, b). The geminating
of the consonant or consonants indicates generally momentaneous
or semelfactive as contrasted with durative activity. I t is also
frequently found in connection with certain types of reduplication
(see § 58, 3 and 4). Less commonly it is employed alone to give
iterative force to the stem (see § 53, 2, b). Sporadic examples in
noun derivationalso occur, e. g. aip a-tsi- B O Y : aiva-(p 'äsi-) Y O U T H .
   (b) Glottalization, the insertion of a more or less movable glottal
stop in the body of a stem or suffix. This occurs most frequently in
connection with certain types of reduplication (see § 58, 3 and 4).
Like gemination, it is also used to express momentaneous activity
and iteration (see § 53, 2, a). Gemination and glottalization tend to
be associated or equivalent processes. This may eventually help
to clear u p the origin of the geminating power of certain stems (§ 16,
2).

and of no functional significance; these may be survivals in part of
older processes, in part they have sound-imitative value. Other
vocalic interchanges are associated with definite alternations of

represent an assimilation of -q iq 'ii- to the a of the prefix (see § 3, 3, e).

more frequent than any of these interchanges is that of ο and u(o);

qualitative and a quantitative one. To the former belong the
change of an a, a·, o, or u of the singular verb stem to an i in the
plural (§ 53, 1, b); the alternation of semelfactive -i- with durative or
iterative -a- (§ 53, 1, c); and the alternation of active - a - with static
or medio-passive -i- (§ 53,1, d). The latter process, vocalic lengthen-
ing, is employed partly to indicate futility, partly in certain continua-
tive forms.
                     § 18.   Compounding of Stems.
   Both • compound nouns and verbs (including adjectives) may be
freely formed in Paiute. A large number are in constant and idio-
matic use, while new compounds can be constructed without difficulty.
The process of compounding is evidently very much alive in Paiute.
Triple compounds, i. e. compounds involving three independent
stems, are by no means infrequent (e. g. qava' (u)-xiVA'cL-väix-j HORSE-
TAIL-HAIR; qiica'-ri'ma-tiv™dcu- BLOOD-ROAST-ASK FOR). Even quad-
ruple compounds are not unknown. Nouns frequently lose an absolu-
tive or classificatory suffix when compounded (e. g. -tsi-, § 24,1, f; -vi-,
-p i-, -mpi-, § 24, 1, a and b; -vi- -pi-, -mp'i-, § 24, 1, d and e); e. g.

   (e) Possessive and objcct. In most of the examples obtained the
possessive is attached to a noun + postposition or to a verbal noun
in - π α - (of objective force). The enclitic object is either the (direct
or indirect) object of the main verb or of a verbal noun (as in relative
constructions in pi-, see § 45). Examples are:

the verb is doubly transitive, as with causatives of transitives, or
when it possesses a direct and indirect object. Examples are:

  (3) T w o   ENCLITIC PRONOUNS COMBINED WITH INDEPENDENT PRO-
NOUNS. M a n y combinations are theoretically possible.            The fol-
lowing have been noted:
  (a) Independent subject + enclitic object + enclitic object, e. g.:
ni'aq arjA p\ni'iiikaK    I-it (vis.)-him (vis.) see-cause, I let him see it
marja""am ini pAxqa'ijqiqw'air)umpa' he-thee-me kill-for-go-momentan-

    through do-him (inv.), you did so to him through my help

  ( 4 ) U S E S OF THREE COMBINED ENCLITIC PRONOUNS.          T h e r u l e s of
combination can be easily formulated from those already given (see
1 above); e. g. -ay'amini-    HE (VIS.)-THEE-ME like -ay'am i- and
-' . . .mini-. The following types of combination have been noted:
  (a) Enclitic subject, first object, and second object, e. g.:
  x
pA qa' yqiyumpay' amini    he will kill thee for me
maa'intca ya'yan ni'nia ijA pA'qa'(u)x-u     find-preterit-him (vis.)-he

generally relates to a second object or to a noun with postposition.

                              § 42. Post-nominal   pronouns.","[212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217]"
"   Post-nominal pronouns (or article-pronouns) are identical in form
with the shorter forms of certain of the independent third personal
pronouns (or demonstratives). T h e y are closely attached, though
not as phonetically amalgamated enclitics, to preceding nouns,
participles, adjectives, numerals, and pronouns, which they serve
to make clearly denominating terms. Frequently they hold together
a group of two or more words as a denominative unit, in which case
they may stand after the first word of the group instead of at the end.
T h e y are practically equivalent to postposed articles and are differ-
entiated according to number, visibility and invisibility, animate and
inanimate, and, to some extent, case. On the whole, case distinctions
are neglected and primarily subjective forms often function also as
objectives. This seems to indicate a tendency towards development
into true articles. Ordinarily an article-pronoun follows immediately
upon the denominating term, but sometimes an intervening enclitic
(pronominal or other) element separates the two, e. g.
qana'ritsnjwi'aq·      um'i    KANAB-PEOPLE-OBJ.-IT     (INV.)   THEY   (INV.),   THE
KANAB INDIANS (OBJ.)-IT.              T h e following post-nominal pronouns are
in use:   (1) ay A HE: animate visible singular, primarily subjective, e. g.:yu'o'RAzqopinaqaina-7)      ατ/Α    leg-break-perfective-verbal noun-his

  The corresponding objective form is also regularly ayA, which
replaces theoretical aya'tA. Examples are:

   remained, only those feathers of the robin were left over
  For ayA = ami, see 2 below.
  An unexplained variant of ayA is aywA, apparently used only after
objective forms, e. g.:
cina'ywavL(y) aywA coyote (obj.) he ( = him)
pavi'av aywA piywa'iA elder brother-obj.-own he ( = him, his) wife
   (obj.), his own elder brother's wife (obj.)

""number dissimilation"" (cf. § 40, 4; § 41, 1, e), the corresponding
singular arjA. This dissimilation takes place after (sometimes before)

  (distributively), the K a n a b Indians' having learned (the) bear dance
 • ""Number dissimilation"" frequently takes place here also; urjWA
is used instead of urrii after animate plural -rjw'i- + possessive or
objective enclitic pronoun, also sometimes after plural -rjw'i- alone.
Examples are:
ini'ayw'iyaip'ia'am-   UIJWA relations-past-objective-thy he (inv.; =
   them), of your dead relations

are:

   Far less often A'qa'iA, a more properly pronominal form, is used as
objective inanimate visible article-pronoun, e.g.:
'atci'AxqatA bow (obj.) it (vis. obj.), the bow (obj.)   (8) URI'F URU   ('URI')   IT: inanimate invisible, primarily subjective,

uru'A, e. g.:

correspondent of 'aiA (7 above) is 'oa'iA, 'wa'i.i, a properly demonstra-

objective uR'i. Examples are:

   Related to 'oa'iA as A qa'iA is to 'a'iA (7 above) is u'qwa'iA, which

pronoun. Examples are:

  There are four demonstrative stems, as already noted (§ 39, 1):
                                       w
a- THAT (indefinite); i-,  THIS; ma-, m a'- THAT (visible; referred
to); and u-, "" V - that (invisible). These stems are not directly
used as independent demonstratives (except for rather infrequently
employed adverbs; a·, ma·'; see § 60, 2, d; 3), but need to be combined
with other elements. The following types of demonstrative usage
may be recognized:   ( 1 ) DEMONSTRATIVE STEMS FOLLOWED BY POSTPOSITIONS.  These
are extremely common and correspond, in function, to inanimate
demonstrative pronoun + postposition. Examples are:
ava"" that-at, there (indefinite)
aru'q-WA that-under, under it
maru'x-WA that (vis.)-to, to it
mava""anA that (vis.)-on, on it
mwa'va' that-at, there (not far away)
ι(y)t'nu this-at, here, present ( < i- a'n u-)
'i'va this-at, here
'i'upathis-through,     in this direction
uvwa"", 'u'vwax that (inv.)-at, there (inv.)
o 'p a'"" (< u-u'p-a'""), °'o'xpa'a (<       'u'-up-a'"") t h a t ( i n v . ) - t h r o u g h , in
  yonder direction  ( 2 ) DEMONSTRATIVE     STEMS +     THIRD PERSON            PRONOMINAL              ELE-
MENTS. These forms function as independent third personal pro-
nouns (§ 39, 1); as article-pronouns (§ 42); and as enclitic third per-
sonal pronouns (§ 40, 1). There is nothing further to be said about
them here except to note once more that these personal demonstratives
often preserve their proper demonstrative force.
   ( 3 ) V E R B S OF DOING. These are nothing but derivatives in -n i-
(§ 26,2, b) of the demonstrative stems. The idea of DOING, ACTING fre-

           SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                   205quently passes over into that of HAVING SOMETHING HAPPEN TO ONE,
BEING. The verbs of doing are: an i- TO DO (indefinitely); mani'-,
mya'n i- τ ο DO (as indicated); in i'-, 'i'n-i- το DO IN THIS MANNER;
un i-, 'u'n i- τ ο DO IN THAT (narrated, unseen) MANNER. Examples
of these verbs are:

tcayi'p· -uniyupiya' near did, (it) got near
'u'n ivä p i do-future-passive partic., about to be done to  In their absolute form verbs of doing frequently function as ad-
verbs of manner. In this capacity they may be combined with
forms of similar morphology that serve as verbs of doing. Examples
are:
a'n i in that (indef.) way
man i'ntca yan %ni'7)U thus-preterit-him- I do-momentaneous, I did
   so (as described) to him

%nic- an t'p iya' thus-again did, acted in the same way, did the same
   thing
""'u'n'Ni   in that (inv.) way
  (4) SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.      From the demonstrative stems o- and
224                          X Southern Paiute and Ute
      206                               SAPIR      u- are formed the verbs of being: aro'a- το be (vis.) and uru'a- το
      be (inv.). See § 56, 1.
        (5) ai-, mai-. These are extended forms of demonstrative a- and
      ma-. They are used as independent inanimate demonstrative pro-
      nouns, particularly with verbs of saying, (talking, hearing). However,
      they are not ordinarily found except followed by pronominal enclitics.
      Their objective forms are aia·, maia- (probably < a-ya-, ma-ya-).
      As to usage, ai- is best translated as t h a t (indefinite), mai- as t h a t
      (quoted, referred to).
        Examples of subjective ai- are:
      a'inl nayqa'q aip ini that-my heard (partic.)-my, that (is) what I
         heard
      a'i(y)aq-A qu'qo'qwikanayum aRi that-it (vis.) shoot (distributively)-
         plural-verbal noun-your (plur.) it (vis.), that (is) it which you
         (plur.) shoot at
        Examples of objective aia- are:
      a'ian 'a'imi      that (obj.)-I say- usitative, that's what I always say
      a'ia y (fir 'a'imi' that (obj.)-he (vis.) indeed say-usitative, that's
         what he indeed always says
      'a'i 'iy'ir 'aik^A that (obj.)-thou indeed said, that indeed you said
          (for 'ai < 'aia', see § 40, 2)
        Curiously enough, objective aia- becomes ai- before the inter-
      rogative, the two elements combining as aitcu'a-, aintcu'a-, e. g.:
      a'itcnan (or a'infcuan) a'ik ?A that (obj.)-interrogative-I said, did
         I say that?
      a'intcua r) 'a'imi' that (obj.)-interrogative-he (vis.) say-usitative, is
         he wont to say that? does he really mean that?
         Subjective mai- is illustrated in:
      ma'in n\ni nar/qa'qaip'ini that (quoted)-my me heard (partic.)-my,
        that's what I heard
      mai'm imi nayqa'q ainA that-thy thee hearing, that's what you hear
        Examples of objective maia- are:
      ma'ian 'aik *A that I say
      ma'i(y) 'iy'ir 'a'ik -Λ that indeed thou sayest (mai < maia' as above)
        Parallel to maia- is m""a'ia-, e. g.:
               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean Language
            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                    207mwa'iAcampa ay 'aik--A that (obj.)-only-he say, that's all he says
u w
 m a'iAcampan niruyw ampa'xA that -(obj.)-only-me I-to talk, that
  only talk to me! stop talking to me!
   As we have already seen, aia- is also used as inanimate visible
objective article-pronoun: 'α'ΪΑ (§ 42, 7). Its parallel invisible 'oa'iA
(probably < u-a-ya-) is not used as independent demonstrative,
though it must be such in origin. For adverbial-connective use of
ai-, see § 60, 2, a; for 'οα'ΪΑ as modal adverb, see § 60, 3.
   (6) VERBS OF SAYING. Parallel to the demonstratives ai- and radi-
äre the verbs of saying: ai- το SAY (indefinitely) and mai- (mwa'ia-)
                                               u w
TO SAY THAT (which has been quoted); e. g. qatc m a' iar/wai' yucampA
NOT SAY-THAT-NEGATIVE-SUBORDINATING-ONLY,          ALTHOUGH NOT SAY-
ING THAT. Either these verbs result from composition with demon-
strative α-, ma- (m w a'-); or they are merely verbified forms of demon-
strative ai- and mat-.
                            Note on § § 39-43.
   The three classes of pronouns already discussed observe the dis-
tinction in the third person between visible (or present) and invisible
(or absent) forms. Nevertheless sentences occur, as may have been
noticed, in which the same person or object is designated now as
visible, now as invisible. To a large extent this seems to be due to a
desire to prevent the same phonetic group (""word"") from containing
both a visible and an invisible element (see, for combinations of
two enclitics, § 41, 1, e), but not entirely. Apparently the difference
between the two sets of forms tends to become a formal rather than
a strictly functional matter. Examples of such contradictory
sentences are:
imi'ntcu'a-ijA pini'Rai'iijWA   tiyi'vw'ia'm u'IJWA thou-interrogative-
   him (vis.) see-him (inv.) friend-obj.-thy he (inv.; = him), did you
   see your friend (inv.)?
toy^o'iMuHaqaifwaiyquywA       qu'qwi'tιιαηΑ      right-forehead-on-obj.-
   his (inv.) shoot-impersonal-him (vis.), (if) anybody shoots him
   right on his forehead
tava'iA mwa'vaq-A qan'juqWA        sun (obj.) there-it (vis.) sit-when-it
    (inv.), when the sun sets there                     § 44. Interrogative pronouns.
  Interrogative stems may he divided into two groups, those employed
denominatively (interrogative pronouns proper) and those employed
                       X Southern Paiute and Ute
208                                SAPiRadverbially or serving as base for adverbial forms. They are not
accompanied by the interrogative enclitic -ru'a- (§ 19, 2, f).
  ( 1 ) D E N O M I N A T I V E FORMS. Four or five denominative stems are
found: aya-, ini-, impi-, and αηια-; further ay a-, which is always
verbalized or adverbialized by suffixed elements.
  (a) arja- WHO? This interrogative refers to persons only. Its
objective form is ayaia-; its subjective plural is ayami- (see § 48, 1),
objective ayam'ia-. I t must not be confused with αηα- H E , THAT
ONE (§ 39). I t is perhaps to avoid this confusion that interrogative
aya- is apparently never used with postpositions; e. g. aya'ruxwA
denotes το HIM, not το WHOM?. The latter idea would have to be
expressed periphrastically (see § 50, 8). Examples of αηα- are:
ay aru""a who is? who is it?
ay aro""avi iyA who would-be this-one? I wonder who this is!
'ay an i'lc -A who does-so? who is it that does so?
at) aije- αηιρα'χαχα who says talking? who is that talking? (referring

ayam,· aro""a who (plur.) are? who are they?
aya'm'iantca' pAxqa'yu whom (plur.)- preterit-thou kill? whom (2)
   did you kill?
  (b) in i-' WHO? WHAT? OF WHAT SORT? This is a generalized
animate interrogative pronoun, referring to an animal, an animate
being not known to be definitely human or animal, or a person of
undefined characteristics. Subjective in-i- sometimes appears as
unelided ini before aro'a- το BE. Its objective singular is inia-·,
subjective plural in iyw'i- (see § 48, 1), objective iniyw'ia-. Examples
are:
in- aro' i'y.i what is this (anim.)?
in i aro""a what is it (anim.)?
ini'ntcan niywu'runl     who-preterit-me person-make-me? who ever
   made me a peron? who ever respected me?
iniyw aro""a what (plur.) are? what are they (animals)?
ini'ywi aro"""" what (plur. obj.) are? to what (animals) does it belong?
  (c) impi-' WHAT (inanimate); objective imp'ia-. In all probability
impi- is connected with in i-·, for -pi- see nominalizing suffix -ρ-'i-, § 25,

WITH) ; it may also be used as a nominal base for verbal derivatives,

of imp'i- are:

imp uru""a what is it (inv.)?
imp'i'a rjA fi'qa'va' what (obj.)-he (vis.) eat-shall? what will he eat
imp'i'ma' fiya'nivani       what-with-thou butcher-will? what will you
  butcher with?
imp'i'xai' what hast thou?
impu'ruyiarjA      what is he making?
   (d) ania- WHAT? This interrogative is used only as the object
of verbs of saying or mental activity, e. g.:
'ani'an 'aik -Λ what-I say? what did I say?
im αη ιΑ nan o'c ivätcf thou what being-wont-to-dream? what have
   you ever dreamt?
ani'a' cy.via 'i' what-thou think-present? what are you thinking of?
   Aside from its use as an interrogative pronoun, an ia- frequently
appears as a verb, ΤΟ SAY WHAT? AS such it is treated analogously to
ai- TO SAY. Examples are:
im 'ani'avatci thou wont-to-say-what? what are you accustomed to
  say?
an i Axqa r)A what did he (vis.) say? (for -qa- see § 32, 2)

"
   Consonantal glides are frequent after the high vowels (i, ϊ, ν).
The semivowels y and w act as glides after i and u respectively,
y after ϊ. A weakly articulated y, such as the y- glide always is, is
really a high-back unrounded semivowel, corresponding to ϊ pre-
cisely as w does to u.
        (1)   y. This glide, often represented as y when only weakly
                   GLIDE
articulated, is rather common between a primary ϊ and a following
vowel. Even ϊ·, when resolved to vi (see § 4, 2, b), may develop to
Vi, iyi. Examples are:
ϊα- to plant                                       'Pa'p i planted, corn
ρϊα- relative                                      p""Ca'm my relative

    deer, elk)
  Curious is ni'u(yw)a'mi I N F R O N T O F ME, in which -y- is a glide
consonant after ϊ, -w- after u (see 3 below).
   (2) G L I D E Y. This occurs very frequently between                       i   (I)   and a
following vowel, e. g.:
qwac          i-tail + -ayΛ his                    qwA'cifyar/A        his tail

the second vowel is voiceless, the w- glide is unvoiced to tv. Examples

tua- son                                tuwa'tsinl my son
-yu- subordinating suffix + -arja-      ivi'xuwarjA when he drank

pu'i eye                                pu'wL-
-u(w)it-uywa-  before                   mo'(w)itux    \VA before me
  The use of -w- as glide seems incidentally to serve as criterion of
the difference between a true m diphthong and a dissyllabic u + i.
Thus, with -u(w)i't uywa above contrast causative -(ui- with diph-
thongal ui (rarely, if ever, uwi).
   (b) Rounded labials. Bilabial consonants (j>, ρ, ν, φ, m) are
normally pronounced with unrounded lips. Under certain conditions,
however, they are pronounced with w- position of the lips. This
position may bring about a slight w- glide between the labial and the
following vowel. Several groups of cases are to be noted.
   Initially mw-, sometimes heard exaggerated into ""mw- or even
umw-, is found in demonstrative two-moraed mwa'-, m ^a'-, THAT
(see § 43); possibly this mwa'~ is developed from an older uma'- >
umwa'- (see below). An initial mw- also sometimes develops before
an immediately following ϊ; e. g. mwim'""i- YE.
   A medial -mw- develops regularly after primary ϊ, ϊ. When the
vowel following the -m w - is unvoiced, the    glide is also unvoiced
(""•). Examples are nim""i- WE (exclu.); cimw'ia- ΤΟ LET GO; ti'mwa- ΤΟ
ROAST; ani'ntcim""   i'mi (ARE) DOING T H E S E ( A N I M . ) ; co 'ri""antimw'i
OTHERS; M ^ I ' M "" ! YE.
  A medial -to""- also often develops after u(o), e. g.:
u- demonstrative + -ma-nti- being        um""a!nfi     therefrom
   at, from

    usitative  Medial -p-, -mp- are frequently rounded to -p w-, -mpw- (unvoiced
      -mp-r)
- p w - ,     after u or i . This seems to take place particularly
before i, whose timbre contrasts most clearly with that of pw. Ex-
amples are t u m p i - ROCK ( t i i ' m p "" i ) ; t u ' p i ' - ΤΟ B E L E F T O V E R ;
                                         w                                                                w

   After ϊ or u, υ is inner-rounded. The result, written vw, is not ν +
   glide but a bilabial ν with inner rounding, a sound acoustically
midway between ν and w. I t is phonetically related to w very much
as y is to y. Before voiceless vowels vw is unvoiced to φw. Examples

   (c) Labialization of k-sounds.  Labialized k- sounds (qw, q w , y w ,
xw) are either primary or arise secondarily by the intrusion of a w-
glide due to a preceding u (o) or o. Examples of labialized k- sounds
due to u (ο) are:-yu-    momentaneous suffix                                              +         ts       pi'yuqwa'                  has appeared

ceding word; e. g. to'o'ivi xwai' BULRUSHES (obj.) THEM < to'oi'vi 'ai\                           § 15.   The Glottal Stop.
   ( 1 ) T Y P E S OF GLOTTAL STOP.     Glottal stops occur very frequently
in Southern Paiute. They are rarely exaggerated in articulation,
however, and are often quite easily missed. The glottal stop may
function as an integral element of a stem (e. g. 'ayu- ΤΟ BE GOOD,
sa'a- ΤΟ BOIL) or grammatical element (e. g. -yw'ai- ΤΟ GO IN ORDER TO,
-n'ni- continuative); as in itself a grammatical process occurring alone
(e. g. dubitative -', § 19, 2, n; -'- to indicate momentaneous activity,
§ 53,2, a, 3), with such grammatical processes as gemination and redu-
plication (§ 53, 2, b; § 58, 3 and 4) or in connection with certain enclitics,
chiefly pronominal (e. g. -' . . . .-mi- THY, THEE) ; in certain circum-
stances to separate vowels brought together by composition (§ 16, 2);
in final position after perfective -{n)tca- and -ywa- and after indepen-
dent personal pronouns preceding verbs of doing and being (§ 5, 3).
The last group of cases may be considered as inorganic or non-function-
al. The first group of cases may be defined as involving an ""inherent""
glottal stop, the second and third an ""accessory"" glottal stop. The
distinction is important phonetically, inasmuch as a syllable con-
taining an ""inherent"" glottal stop counts for two moras whether its
vowel is short or long, while a short-voweled syllable with ""accessory""
glottal stop counts for only one mora (see § 8, 1, a, end; 2, a, end;
§ 9, end). Outwardly these two types of glottal stop are identical,
but they probably belong to quite distinct historical strata, the
""accessory"" group no doubt representing a later development or
influencing of the word form. Rarely there is evidence to show
that an ""inherent"" glottal stop may arise by way of compensation
for the loss of a vowel. This seems to be true, at least, of na'y'iVA'-

"  The interrogative frequently combines with a following -γαinia-
(see a above) in the meaning of IT SEEMS THAT. The enclitic - Η Ι Α -
(see d above) may be introduced between the two enclitics. Pro-
nominal elements may separate the interrogative (or following -nia-)
from -yainia-.   Examples are:pua'r'uavar'onLxaint.'     medicine-become-shall-interrogative-I-appar-

element -rua- {-tcua-, -ntcua-·, -ntua-) has not been found alone, but
only compounded with interrogative -r'o- + enclitic -n ia-. This
compound enclitic has been found only with nouns. It follows posses-
sive pronominal enclitics. Examples are:

-cia-) has not been found alone, but only compounded with modal
-ywa- (see c above) and generally - n o a - (see e above). Pronominal
enclitics come between the -ywa- and the -n oa-, except, as usual,
-ni- I, ME, which follows -n oa-. Examples are:
qu'qwi'tu'acuyaywaayanoA       shoot-impersonal-would that!-him-in-
  definite, I wish he would get shot!
qu'qwi'lu'acuywaraminoA    I wish we two (inclus.) would get shot!
qu'qwi'iu'acuywanoani    would that I might get shot!
   In this sense -cuya-ywcMioa-     is often attached to the verbal
irrealis -yo-pu-, -r/qo-pu- (see § 33, 1), e. g.:
tu'pu'niyuxpuciaywo(')no'    wake-might-would that!-thou-indefinite,

  With impi- WHAT (see § 44, 1, c), -c uya-ywa-n oa- or, more briefly,
-cuya-ywa- adds a flavor of unreality: WHAT PRAY! Examples are:

  pray, is one (to cut it up) ? (i. e. there is no knife handy)

  what, pray, will he eat? (i. e. there is no food to give him)
  (i) -c a'a- AND, BUT; THEN! This element is used partly as a con-
nective or contrastive (AND, BUT), partly as an emphasizing particle
(THEN!). In the latter use it is frequently appended to ϊν""ϊ-, the
hortatory adverb. Examples are:

commonly with independent third personal and reflexive pronouns

suffixes (-kai-, -leu-), see § 55, 1, b, e. I t has largely lost its individu-
ality with personal pronouns, as indicated by its double employment
in forms like mafi'c cu' above, i. e. mafi'-c u-.
   (1) -c uru'u- NOR CAN. It was not found possible to elucidate
this infrequently occurring enclitic satisfactorily. I t is evidently
compounded of -cu- (see k above); perhaps -ru'u- was misheard
for interrogative -ru'a-. Examples are:

not easily classified and, in part, of doubtful significance, may be

of these enclitics indicates. They precede pronominal enclitics, but
follow certain other enclitic elements (e. g. -tea-, see 1, a above; -C M-,

"  (5) TREATMENT OF y. The back-guttural y is apt to undergo
various modifications, aside from unvoicing (§ 8), palatalization (4
above), and labialization (§ 14, 3, c).   (a) Stopping to g. In poetry y is not infrequently stopped to
g (the sonant correspondent of q). In prose this occurs when a final
-y of the preceding word comes, by elision of an initial vowel (see §
10, 3, end), to stand immediately before the -γ-, e. g. a'ia-η ϊγϊκTHAT-HE INDEED >     a'ia-η gin.
   (b) Weakening or loss of y. An original y is sometimes weakened
to a glide y or even entirely lost before or after an u- vowel, more
often after an ϊ- vowel. Vocalic contractions may then result (see
§ 4). Examples are:
na-^u'q wi-yqi- to fight (lit., to       ncFu'q wnjqi-, na'uq wii]qi-
   shoot at each other < quq wi-
   to shoot)
yauywi- to enter                         ya-uywi-
fiyia- deer (-γ- may be glide,           Xi 'iamqua^i    deer-meat
   however; see § 14, 1)
fiyi'vi- friend                          ti-'vini my friend

                                             raintian C close towards it
tuyu- up (e. g. tuyu'ntux-WA       up-   *tiyi-, *Xiyi- > <ϊ·-, tri- up
   ward)

              SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                      53   (c) Unvoicing to χ in voiced position. Even before a voiced vowel
y is sometimes heard not merely as an intermediate χ , with which
it varies frequently, but as a fully unvoiced χ (or lengthened i );
similarly y > x. This sharpening seems to be frequent after an
accented a, particularly in the neighborhood of a glottal stop, e. g.:
-ayava- yu- right among                  a a'xavaiyu     right in there
-yi- to come in order to                 yu'(v>)a!xtyami      come to take

iya'vaya-     to fear                    iya'vaxan'nami     whom you feared
   (6) VOCALIZATION OF SEMIVOWELS. T h e semivowels y and w
are sometimes opened up to the corresponding vowels i and u {o).
Forms with glide -i- (§5, 1) are transitional; e. g. -aya- > -a(i)ya- >
-aia-. Examples of -y- > -i- are:
nampa'-ya rjA his foot (obj.)            ηαηνρα'ία ηΛ
narja- anger + y(a)'ai- to die of         naija'i'ai-
  > naya'y'ai- to be angry
  After an i, the i < y apparently disappears as such, fusing with
the preceding vowel, e. g.:
tuqwi-    shame + y(a)'ai-               tu'qwi'ai-    to be ashamed
tsi- with the point + yauywL-
   tca- to cause several objects to      1sia-'u*>witcAp'iya' caused (them)

                                           point (§ § 4, 1, a; 13, 5, b)
  A w immediately following a back-palatal stop or i) is sometimes
opened to u or still further, before a, to 3 (cf. development of -wa- to
-wo-, -ο-; § 3, a, 3), e. g.:
-ntcuqw(-ruqw)        avi"" underlies     imi'ntcuq-u avi"" lies under thee;
                                           aruq o avi"" lies under it

54                                        SAPIR   ( 7 ) SIMPLIFICATION OF CONSONANTS.     Here are grouped together
a number of consonantal simplifications or partial losses of charac-
teristic quality, found chiefly in sentence phonetics.
   (a) Simplification of affricatives. A final -ts- ( < -tri-) or, less
often, -tc'f is sometimes reduced to -<·, -<·' before a word beginning
with a dental (f, n), less frequently before a word beginning with a
labial, e. g.:
""Uni'rjuts· then                             %ni'rjut- nontsi'k-up'iya' then flew
                                                 off; iini'ijut·' maya'iacu   then

                                                 (< i'tcf tTqa 'q-A)
     An internal -ist- is sometimes reduced to -t ri-, -tn- before η (see §
3, 2 , C ) :wiHsi't smi my great-grandchild                wi'Uit-v,(n)l
na' a'ints tsmiA like a girl                 na'a'ints tnniA
     (b) Assimilation      of -R to n-.     This happens only rarely, e. g.:
yu'un αΒ.(ϊ)          my leg                  yu'un an nantsi'n'aijqix i    come
                                                and joint my leg
   (c) Loss of labialization. Before an u or ο of the following word
a final -qw-, -yw-, -yw- is apt to lose its w (cf. simplification of wo < wa
after back-palatal stops to a; § 3,1, c). Examples are:
-raijw(a-) we                                'ivw'i'rat) iiru'yuts· let us then

   Final -x w sometimes melts with following qw- to -q-w- (cf. § 8, 1,
g), e. g.:

following types of sibilant assimilation have been observed.
  (a) Assimilation of s—c to s—-s. This seems to be rare. An
example is Asi'-saywa- LIGHT BLUE (contrast -ica- of qwica- τ ο
SPAHK).  (b) Assimilation of s—tc to c—tc. This also is not common. A
good example is cdcu- NAIL < sitcu- < *situ- (cf. Kawaiisu -cito-).
   (c) Assimilation     of ts—c to tc—c or ts—s.      Generally ts—s appears,
e. g.:
-tsi-c u-,-ts -cu-    (§ 35; § 19, 2, k)   -tsis u-, -tssu-:   pika'xit-

   Yet tc—c also seems to occur, e. g. sari'tcicum            ONLY MY DOG       <
sari'tsi-cu-.
   (d) Assimilation of tc—s to tc—c. This uncommon type is il-
lustrated, e. g., in tca 'c L%ani MENSTRUAL HUT (for more normal
-as-1- contrast as ia - SURFACE).
  (e) Assimilation of ts—tc to tc—tc (ts—ts).      The normal tc—tc
assimilation, which occurs very frequently, is illustrated in:
-tsi- noun suffix + -tcu'a- inter-         a'ipatcitcu'""    a boy?
   rogative
-tsi- + -tcu- to make                      naya-'tcitcuqwayumpa,'     will turn

  T h e less frequent assimilation to ts—ts is probably regular when
the primary ts is initial, e. g. ts -tsa'yki'a- ΤΟ CARRY ON A POLE (tsi-
WITH THE POINT, § 21, 9). Moreover, subordinating -tsi- (§ 55, 1, a),
unlike diminutive -tsi- or nominal -tsi- (cf. above examples), seems
regularly to maintain itself and to assimilate following tc to ts, e. g.:
ψιι'-tsi- having so done, then +           ifni'tsitsayWA   then we
   -tcar/wa- we

"                        § 48. Plurality of nouns.
   There are two types of noun plurals: the reduplicated form, which
is more properly distributive in function, for both animate and
inanimate nouns (see § 58, 2 for these forms); and properly plural
suffixes, which can, for the most part, be appended only to noun
stems referring to animate beings (cf. the presence of singular and
plural animate forms and the lack of distinctively plural inanimate
forms in the third personal pronouns).
  (1) ANIMATE PLURAL SUFFIXES. Two animate plural suffixes
exist, -ijw'i-' and -mi-', with exactly parallel functions and differ-
entiated merely according to the preceding stem. These elements
apply to duals also, -r/w'i- is evidently spirantized from an older
-mi- (§16, 1); -mi- is the corresponding geminated (and nasalized)
form. Their Uto-Aztekan prototype *-me actually occurs as an
animate plural in Nahuatl {-mi).    In actual practice it seems hardly

214                                 SAPIR
feasible to assign -yw'i- to spirantizing stems alone, -m-'i- definitely
to all geminating (and nasalizing) stems, as their range of usage
seems to intercross with that of types of stem; thus, nominal -tsi-n
(§ 24, 1, f) forms plural -tsiyw'C-, while participial -ti-n (§ 25, 6) forms
-tim 'i-. No simple rules can therefore be given for the use of -yw'i-
or -ιιι ϊ-.
   (a) -mi- (subjective); -m-ϊα- (objective). Examples are:
naya'mi     mountain sheep (sing. na'x A)
qA'qa'rami    quails (sing. qAzqa'w)
tciya'mi   ducks (sing. ici'x-A)
a(i)ya'm'i  turtles (sing. α'ΪΑ)
wTtca'mi    roadrunners (sing. wi't cA)
a'ivam iratjWA our (inclus.) young men (sing. a'i<t>Apits· young man)
yu'tami      Utes (sing, yu-'t-a-ts··, plur. also yu 't a tsajw'i)
   In the last two examples a nominalizing suffix of the singular
(-ρ-'ttsi-, -isi-) has been dropped before the plural suffix. This is not
common; but cf., further, sari't'i'qami         ARAPAHO I N D I A N S (lit.
DOG-EAT-PLURAL, noun-verb compound noun; sing. sari 't Tqats ).
   Animate plural -m 'i- is also appended to cardinal -yu- of numerals
for TWO and above, when used attributively with enclitic -n ta-,
before animate nouns, e. g.:
waa!(i)yumuni    wi'tsi'tsiywiarjA   two-cardinal-animate plur.-like
  great-grandchildren-plural-her (vis.), her two great-grandchildren.
   (b) -ijw'i- (subjective); -Tjwia-, rjwa(·)- (objective). The objective
in -rjwa{·)- is very common; it is merely a phonetic variant of -tjwia-
(see §4, 1, a). Examples of subjective -r/w'i- are:
nava'virjwi    reciprocal-elder brother-plural, two brothers         (sing.
   pavi'm my elder brother)
paa'yw'i aunts; paa'rjwini my aunts (sing, paa'ni my aunt)

   The use of animate plurals for singulars conceived of as singled out
from a group has been already discussed in connection with participles
in -ti-m 'i- (§ 25, 6, f). This same usage applies to many animate
plurals in -yw'i- as well, e. g.:
pina'p 'äsityw αηΛ smallest-plur. he (vis.), the smallest (boy) of all
rii' avi'mjyimpinarapltsir/WL     I very-least-plur., I (am the) very
    least in size (of my family)
qam 'i' ovi'nluaqwoip-njw'i""   jack-rabbit (obj.) (hair)-having-come-off-
    moving-plur. (obj.), jack-rabbit (obj.) with hair having come off
    from dragging along (referring to one particular animal out of
    several)
   (2) PLURAL -q a-. This suffix has been already discussed as a
verb element defining plurality of the subject (§31, 1, c). I t occurs,
though not frequently, also in the inanimate noun before objective
-ya- (§ 49, 1 ) , postpositive -ma- WITH (§ 50, 4, 9), and possibly other
post-positions to emphasize the plurality (as contrasted with duality)
of an attached enclitic possessive pronoun. I t does not, therefore,
primarily indicate plurality of the noun itself, though this may be
implied. Examples are:tivwL p'iaqa{i)yaTjumi        country-possessive-plural-objective-your
   (plur.), your (plur.) country (obj.) t h a t (you) own
tiya'n'Lmp'iqamami      seed-beater-plural-with-their (vis.), with their
   (plur.) seed-beater(s)                         § 49. Syntactical   cases.
   Paiute recognizes two fundamental syntactical cases, the sub-
jective and objective. The former of these is in use as the subject
of a non-subordinate verb; the object of an imperative (see § 52); and
as a base for the affixing of postpositions (see § 50). The objective is
the case of the object of a transitive verb; the subject of a subordinate
verb (see §55, 1); the genitive (possessive); and the apposition to
a noun with postposition (see §50, 3).
  ( 1 ) FORMATION OF SYNTACTICAL CASES. The subjective case is
simply the absolutive, the unmodified noun with no specific case

216                              SAPIRsuffix. The objective is formed by suffixing -a- to the final vowel
of the noun, if this vowel is i, I, a, or u (o); -ya- (-ία-) if the final
vowel is a. Examples are:
         SUBJECTIVE                           OBJECTIVE
sari'is- dog ( < -iSL-)               sari 'tsi' (< -tsia-)
ayqa'qwicaRi    lightning             atjqa' qwicanA
U'qwi'yu' arrow ( < u'qwt'yw-)        vxqwi yuu (< u'qwi'yva-)
qanini my house                       qani'ani
qam'ayA his (vis.) house              qani'aijA
quna'vi'imi thy sack                  quna'via'ami
ραΛ water                             paa'tA
paa'rami our (2 inclus.) aunt         paa'iarami
nampa 'yA his (vis.) leg (stem        nampa'ia-ηΑ
  nampa-)
   Another objective suffix, -q u-, -yqu-, is used after numeral stems
(see § 59, 2, a) and after certain postpositions (e. g. -ma-, -ψοα- ON;
-rjwa'ai- TOGETHER WITH; -mpa-AT; -upa- THROUGH; see § 5 0 , 4 ) ;
cf. also adverbial ü ijqu- (§ 30, 2, b).
  (2) U S E OF SYNTACTICAL CASES. The subjective as a subject and
the objective as a transitive object are so plentifully illustrated in
the course of this paper that no further examples need be given here.
The other uses of the subjective will be illustrated below (§ 52; §
50), also the use of the object as the subject of a subordinate verb
(§55, 1).
  The genitive function of the objective is seen, e. g., in:
ftv^i'pT qiip»a 'ava'LnfC land (obj.) edge-at-participle (obj.), being
   (obj.) at (the) edge of (the) land
•Hwa'ri' tu(w)a'tsii)wi rain (obj.) children, Rain's children
  Often with pleonastic use of a pronominal enclitic, e. g.:
cina'ywavL %ntu' q-urjWA coyote (obj.) back-flesh-his (inv.), Coyote's
   back flesh
qam""aijw u'u'rn paa'(i)ya<t>i (he went) house-obj.-her it-toward
   aunt-obj.-own, (he went) toward his aunt's house
   While the subjective form is used as a base for the suffixing of a
postposition, the form is felt as the equivalent of an objective, as
appositions to such nouns or pronouns are regularly put in the objec-
tive, e. g. wantsi αϊ] αψι'ητα ANTELOPE (OBJ.) HE (VIS.; = HIM) HE-

tremely common (see § 50, 3).
   The sporadic subjective use of objective forms of independent
personal pronouns in certain not clearly understood cases has been
already mentioned (§ 39, 4, end).","[231, 232, 233, 234, 235]"

-miriimp'Lyai- (see 11 below); e. g. yaa'imip'iya' or yaa'im inimp'iya'
USED τ ο HUNT.    I t is not obvious what difference in meaning, if any,
there is between usitative participles in -vatci- (§ 25, 6, c) and -m intt-.
Curiously enough, participles in -ti- may also be made usitative by
suffixed -m ia-, e. g.:

  it as fire
   (11) -η ·ϊ- η usitative, used only before past passive participle
-p i- (§ 25, 5, b) and its temporal derivative -p iyai- (§ 32, 6). Contrary
to phonetic rule, not -n 'ipKyai)- results, but -n 'impi(yai)-.
   Examples of usitative passive participial -η ϊηιρϊ- are:
p'ini'nu'iriimpiA (things) always seen about (obj.)
main'Lyunirnpiqwani     my always saying it (song form)
  The common use of -η ϊιη,ρϊ- as a means of forming instrumental
nouns has been already discussed (§ 25, 2).
  Examples of -n 'imp'iyai-, the usitative form of the narrative past,
are:
lint- to do                                 %ninimp'iya'     kept doing

ora-      to dig                            ora'n 'imp'iya' used to dig
  The suffix may be preceded, as we have already seen, by the common
usitative suffix -m-i- (see 10 above). Examples of the combined
-m iriimpiyai- are:

forms -mip'iyai-, -nimp'iyai- and -m-in'imp'iyai-.     I t may be pointed
out, however, t h a t -nimp'iyai- does not seem to occur after momentan-
eous -7/W-, which requires a following -m-i-. This may imply that the
-7U-"" usitative tends to have a more strictly durative character than
-m i-"", which in turn may have a momentaneous -iterative color.   (12) -n'ni-' (-ni'i-') continuative. This is a common durative
suffix that, with verbs of movement, shades into a significance not
very different from that of -m'mia- (§ 28, 4). I t seems best defined
as a continuative, equivalent in meaning to such English locutions as
το k e e p -ING, το be -Ing. It refers to an act consummated at one
period, not, like the usitative, to one which is repeated at intervals.
Examples are:mntsi- to fly                        nontsi'n'ni flies around

-' . . .n-i·-'. These elements seem to differ from the more common
-n'ni-, partly in reinforcing the idea of plurality or distribution of
the subject, partly in conveying a usitative implication. The matter
is not altogether clear, however. Examples are:antlt-a-    several do                 anik ani-l%a     while (they) do so

   Number is expressed in the verb in four different ways: 1, by
reduplication, properly a distributive formation but frequently
expressing plurality of subject or subject (see § 58, 3); 2, by the use of
distinctive stems for the singular and plural, a few of the plural
stems being used only as second members of verb + verb compounds
(see § 54); 3, by the use of suffixes indicating plurality of the subject
or, less commonly, of the object; 4, by the use of suffixes expressing
ideas of number and voice (transitiveness and intransitiveness) at
the same time. Only the last two processes are here discussed.
   Even aside from pronominal elements, it is always possible to tell
from the form of a verb whether its animate subject is singular or
plural, often, also, whether its object is singular or plural. Verbs
with a dual subject are singular in form, but are differentiated in
practice from singulars by their employment of plural (or, in two
cases, distinctively dual) pronominal elements (§ 40). Thus,

   Edward Sapir (1884-1939) has been referred to as ""one of the most brilliant
scholars in linguistics and anthropology in our country"" (Franz Boas) and as
""one of the greatest figures in American humanistic scholarship"" (Franklin
Edgerton). His classic book, Language (1921), is still in use, and many of his
papers in general linguistics, such as ""Sound Patterns in Language"" and ""The
Psychological Reality of Phonemes,"" stand also as classics. The development of
the American descriptive school of structural linguistics, including the adop-
tion of phonemic principles in the study of non-literary languages, was pri-
marily due to him.
   The large body of work he carried out on Native American languages has
been called ""ground-breaking"" and ""monumental"" and includes descriptive,
historical, and comparative studies. They are of continuing importance and
relevance to today's scholars.
   Not to be ignored are his studies in Indo-European, Semitic, and African
languages, which have been characterized as ""masterpieces of brilliant associa-
tion"" (Zellig Harris). Further, he is recognized as a forefather of ethnolinguistic
and sociolinguistic studies.
   In anthropology Sapir contributed the classic statement on the theory and
methodology of the American school of Franz Boas in his monograph, ""Time
Perspective in Aboriginal American Culture"" (1916). His major contribution,
however, was as a pioneer and proponent for studies on the interrelation of
culture and personality, of society and the individual, providing the theoretical
basis for what is known today as humanistic anthropology.
   He was, in addition, a poet, and contributed papers on aesthetics, literature,
music, and social criticism.

   Volumes I-VI of The Collected Works of Edward Sapir consist, for
the most part, of shorter papers; by contrast, Volumes VII-XV are
devoted to longer works of monographic nature — grammars, diction-
aries, text collections, and extended ethnographic accounts. Many of
these were published by Sapir during his lifetime; others were edited by
his students and published after his death; still others are now being
edited and published for the first time. The organization of each indi-
vidual volume in this latter group brings together, in most instances,
works on a single language and culture; in a few volumes, however, the
unifying element is one of linguistic family or of culture area.
   Preparation of these monographic volumes has been aided by grants
from the National Science Foundation (grant no. BNS-8609411), the
Phillips Fund of the American Philosophical Society, and the Wenner-
Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.
   Sapir received his doctorate at Columbia University in 1908, and
took up a position at the University of Pennsylvania. His first field
work thereafter, in 1909, was in Utah, with the Uncompahgre and
Uintah Utes. Back in Philadelphia in 1910, be obtained a much
greater amount of data on a closely related dialect, the Kaibab variety
of Southern Paiute, as spoken by Tony Tillohash, then a student at
Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. The major publication which
resulted from this work, Sapir's Southern Paiute Language — gram-
mar, texts, and dictionary — was written in 1917, but not published
until 1930 — 31; it is reprinted in the present volume. Permission for
this reprinting has kindly been granted by the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences. In addition, we publish here for the first time an
English index to Sapir's Southern Paiute dictionary, prepared by Wick
Miller, as well as ethnographic notes gathered by Sapir from his Ute
and Paiute consultants, here edited and annotated by Catherine S.
Fowler and Robert C. Euler. A topic index for the present volume
has been prepared by Jane McGary.
   The Editorial Board is grateful to Robert C. Euler, Catherine S.
Fowler, Jane McGary, and Wick Miller for their participation in the
preparation of this volume.

                            Introduction
   The Great Basin of the western United States was, aboriginally,
occupied mainly by tribes who spoke languages of the Uto-Aztecan
family, specifically of the Numic branch. In older literature, this branch
is also referred to as ""Plateau Shoshonean,"" and the term ""Shoshonean""
has been used for a putative larger grouping within Uto-Aztecan.
   Within Numic, three divisions are generally recognized. The Western
group includes language varieties labeled as Mono (or Monache) and
Owens Valley Paiute, in eastern California — plus Northern Paiute in
Nevada and Oregon, and Bannock in Idaho. Central Numic includes
Panamint (or Koso) in California; Shoshone in Nevada, Utah, and
Wyoming; and Comanche in the southern Plains. Finally, Southern
Numic consists of Kawaiisu in California; Chemehuevi and Southern
Paiute in southern California, Nevada, Utah, and northwestern Arizona;
and Ute in Utah and Colorado.
   The term ""Paiute"" itself, unfortunately, has no clear ethnic or lin-
guistic reference; nevertheless, the term ""Southern Paiute"" is well estab-
lished as referring to some sixteen Numic ""bands"" or subgroups which
share a geographical center in southern Utah. (For a survey of Numic
linguistics, see Miller 1986.) Among linguists, at least, it seems likely
that the currency of the term ""Southern Paiute"" has been reinforced by
its use in the title of one of Edward Sapir's most important works.
   Sapir's research on Numic began with a field trip undertaken early
in his career. After fieldwork on Wishram Chinook in 1905, on Takelma
in 1906, and on Yana in 1907, Sapir completed his doctorate at Colum-
bia University in 1908 and accepted a position at the University of
Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1909, with his student J. Alden Mason,
Sapir arrived in Utah to study Southern Numic speech, beginning with
the Uncompahgre Utes at Ouray Reservation. Finding that few Indians
there spoke adequate English, he soon moved to the Uintah Utes at
White Rocks (see Sapir's letter to A. L. Kroeber dated 7 September
1909, in Golla 1984: 43). A brief report, ""Some Fundamental Charac-
teristics of the Ute Language,"" was published in 1910 (Sapir 1910c,
reprinted in Volume V of The Collected Works).
   Back at the University of Pennsylvania in 1910, Sapir hoped to find
a Ute speaker at Carlisle Indian School near Harrisburg; instead, he
14                      X Southern   Paiute and   Ute
found Tony Tillohash, who spoke the Kaibab dialect of Southern Paiute.
Tillohash moved to Philadelphia for four months, providing Sapir with
much more comprehensive data than had been obtained on Ute (see
Fowler and Fowler 1986). Four short papers resulted shortly thereafter:
""Song Recitative in Paiute Mythology"" (Sapir 191 Od), ""Two Paiute
Myths"" (1910f), ""The Mourning Ceremony of the Southern Paiutes""
(1912c), and ""A Note on Reciprocal Terms of Relationship"" (1913c);
these are reprinted in Volume IV of The Collected Works. However, the
major descriptive result was Sapir's Southern Paiute Language — a
grammar, a text collection, and a dictionary — written in 1917, but not
published until 1930 — 31. This work is reprinted in the present volume,
along with a previously unpublished English index to the dictionary,
prepared by Wick R. Miller.
   Sapir's work on Numic linguistics is noteworthy from three viewpoints
in particular. First, his 1910 report on Ute described the typical Numic
phonological alternation of voiceless stops (p t k kw), voiced stops (b
d g gw), voiced fricatives (ß r γ yw), and voiceless fricatives (φ R χ
Xw); in his work on Southern Paiute, Sapir not only found the same
alternation, but also confirmed Tony Tillohash's intuitive awareness of
the relationship. Reported in Sapir's famous article, ""La realite psycho-
logique des phonemes"" (1933c, in Volume I), this finding remains one
of the paradigmatic examples of modern phonological theory. Second,
Sapir's Numic data made possible a historical study, ""Southern Paiute
and Nahuatl"" (1913f and 1915i) — his first important work in the
comparative/historical study of American Indian languages, and a pi-
oneering application in the New World of the Neogrammarian meth-
odology established in the Indo-European field. All subsequent activity
in comparative Uto-Aztecan linguistics is founded on this work of
Sapir's. Third and finally, the Southern Paiute grammar itself has come
to be recognized as a monument of American descriptive linguistics: a
model of accuracy, clarity, thoroughness, and insight which later schol-
ars have striven to emulate.
  In addition to data on language, Sapir collected ethnographic infor-
mation from his Numic consultants, and organized these materials with
eventual publication in mind. The resulting manuscripts had an ""un-
derground"" existence after Sapir's death, being consulted by several
ethnographers. They have at last been edited for publication in this
volume, by Catherine S. Fowler and Robert C. Euler, whose introduc-
tory essay explains the detailed circumstances.
                               Introduction                           15  Little has been published on the Southern Paiute language since
Sapir's day; however, there is significant work on the Ute dialect of
southern Colorado by Goss (1972) and Givon (1979, 1980); and on
Chemehuevi by Press (1979). There is an unpublished dissertation on
Southern Paiute by Bunte (1979); see also Bunte (1986) and Bunte and
Franklin (1988). Proposals for the reanalysis of Sapir's data on Southern
Paiute phonology have been published by Harms (1966), Rogers (1967),
Chomsky and Halle (1968: 345-351), Lovins (1972), Cairns (1978),
and Franklin and Bunte (1980). Manuscript vocabularies for a number
of Numic dialects, collected by J. W. Powell during his nineteenth-
century expeditions, are given by Fowler and Fowler (1971).
  Important ethnographic sources include Stewart (1942) for both the
Ute and the Southern Paiute, Kelly (1964) for the Southern Paiute, and
Smith (1974) for the Ute. Volumes on Chemehuevi ethnography and
oral literature have been published by Laird (1976, 1984). Recent surveys
of ethnographic and historical information are provided by Kelly and
Fowler (1986) for the Southern Paiute, and by Calloway et al. (1986)
for the Ute.

               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean   Language
                             PREFACE.
   The following sketch of Southern Paiute, which was completed in
December, 1917, is offered as a contribution to the scientific study of
the Shoshonean languages. Whether or not it proves to be fairly
typical of the whole group in phonologic and morphologic respects
must be left to future research.
   My first field acquaintance with Shoshonean linguistics was gained
in a short trip during August and September of 1909 among the
Northern Utes of Uintah Reserve, Utah. This trip was undertaken,
with the collaboration of Dr. J. A. Mason, under the auspices of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. A number of Ute texts
were secured, supplemented by considerable grammatical information.
To extend and deepen the insight into Plateau Shoshonean linguistics
then obtained it seemed advisable, indeed necessary, to undertake
further researches. Hence arrangements were made by the late
Dr. G. B. Gordon, Director of the Museum of the University of
Pennsylvania, with the authorities of the Indian school at Carlisle
to have one of their Paiute students, Tony Tillohash, put a t my
disposal for the ethnologic and linguistic study of his tribe. I worked
with Tony, who proved to be an excellent informant, in Philadelphia
from February to May of 1910. A series of texts, much supple-
mentary grammatical material, a large number of songs, and con-
siderable ethnological information were obtained. The Paiute
linguistic data proved so much superior to the Ute which I had
previously secured that I have decided in this sketch to limit myself
to the former. Moreover, there is enough phonetic, lexical, and
morphologic difference between Ute and Southern Paiute to render
the attempt to describe both at the same time confusing. I hope to
publish a briefer sketch of the Ute language at some future date.
   The present volume is to be followed by a series of Southern Paiute
and Ute texts and by a Southern Paiute vocabulary. I t is a great
pleasure to recall the unflagging patience and helpfulness of Tony
Tillohash and the kindness with which Dr. Gordon did all that lay
in his power to make these studies possible. My thanks are due Miss
Jane McHugh, the Secretary and at that time Acting Director of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, and the authorities of the
Museum for permission to have these Paiute studies published by the

    SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE.
                  § 1.   Distribution and Literature.
   The Shoshonean dialect t h a t is more particularly treated in this
paper is Kaibab Paiute, spoken in southwestern Utah and north-
western Arizona. The name Kaibab is an Anglicized form of the
native qa'im vitci ""mountain-lying, plateau."" The Kaibab Paiutes
are only one of a large number of tribes or bands in southwestern
Utah, northwestern Arizona, southern Nevada, and southeastern
California that have been loosely grouped together as Paiute proper
or Southern Paiute. The linguistic differences found in the speech
of the various Paiute bands are slight. Paiute itself belongs, accord-
ing to Kroeber's terminology, to the Ute-Chemehuevi branch of
Plateau Shoshonean, a branch t h a t includes, besides the Paiute
dialects, the Ute dialects of western Colorado and most of Utah,
Kawaiisu (spoken in south-central California), and Chemehuevi
(spoken in southeastern California along the Colorado; the Cheme-
huevi are probably nothing b u t a Paiute band that have been sub-
jected to strong Yuman influences). I t is doubtful if even the geo-
graphically extreme Ute-Chemehuevi dialects, say Uncompahgre
Ute and Chemehuevi, are not mutually intelligible with considerable
ease. The two other branches of Plateau Shoshonean are Shoshone-
Comanche (including Shoshone proper, Comanche, Gosiute, and
Shikaviyam, spoken in California) and Mono-Paviotso (including
Mono, Northern Paiute or Paviotso, "" S n a k e "" of eastern Oregon,
and Bannock). Southern Paiute and Northern Paiute should be
carefully distinguished; they are not dialects of the same language,
but distinct and mutually unintelligible languages. Indeed, Ute-
Chemehuevi differs from both Shoshone-Comanche and Mono-
Paviotso in important morphological as well as phonetic respects.
Thus, pronominal elements are suffixed (or enclitically affixed) in
Ute-Chemehuevi, but prefixed (or proclitically affixed) in the other
two branches of Plateau Shoshonean.
  The Shoshonean languages, according to Kroeber, comprise four
groups: the Plateau Shoshonean languages; Tiibatulabal or Kern
River, spoken in south-central California; Hopi; and a group of
southern Californian languages comprising the Serrano dialects, the
dialects of the San Luiseno-Cahuilla branch, and the Gabrielino

6                                       SAPIRdialects. The phonetic, lexical, and morphologic differences between
these four groups of Shoshonean languages are evidently considerable.
All the Shoshonean languages, taken as a unit, comprise the northern-
most representative of the Uto-Aztekan stock. This stock includes,
besides Shoshonean, Nahuatl or Aztec and the Sonoran or Piman
languages spoken in the long stretch of country between the Mexican
state of Jalisco and the Rio Gila (among these languages are Cora;
Huichol; Yaqui-Opata-Cahita-Tarahumare; Pima-Papago-Tepehuane-
Tepecano). So far as is at present known, the Uto-Aztekan languages
are not genetically related to any other American languages.
   The published material dealing with the Ute-Chemehuevi dialects
is scanty. We have some sketchy material of Kroeber's; 1 a phonetic
study of Southern Ute by J. P. Harrington; 2 and a brief abstract on
Ute by Sapir. 3 Some linguistic material on Southern Paiute is also
contained in Sapir's Song Recitative in Paiute Mythology,4 A compara-
tive treatment of Uto-Aztekan, primarily from the point of view of
Southern Paiute, is given in Sapir's Southern Paiute and Nahuatl,

"                         § 52. The imperative.
  The imperative is only negatively determined as regards form, i. e.
by the absence of tense elements, further by the frequent absence of
the second person singular in forms that have a pronominal or nominal
object. Syntactically, imperatives are remarkable in that they
take an object in the subjective form. The pronominal subject or
object, as usual, may be appended either to the verb or to a preceding
element, e. g. hortatory iVi'- (§ 60, 2, d). Examples illustrative of
these remarks are:
ivi""i drink-thou! drink!
avi'mituywa'""     it-out of-thou! go out!
iVi'"" ivi'yu hortatory-thou drink-momentaneous! go ahead, take a

vvwa'nfini    ya'yqihi     it (inv.)-at-being (subjective)-me carry-for-
   hither! bring me (it) over there!
  Imperatives with a dual or plural subject do not seem to occur with
enclitic pronominal subject, but arc characterized instead by an

236                                      SAPIRenclitic -ya-, appended either to the verb form or a preceding word.
In plural imperative forms the verb is plural in form; dual imperatives,
particularly if intransitive, frequently add dual pronominal enclitic
   . . .ml- to -ya-: -y'am'i-. Examples of plural and dual imperatives,
with and without pronominal objects, are:
ti''qa'q a(i)rA,     tVqa'qai*   e a t ye!
qatcu'i' minta'n'ia'p-A not-plur. imper. run (plur. verb-stem)- nega-

   What is probably an emphatic imperative is sometimes formed by
appending enclitic -aqa- to the verb or a preceding word. In all
probability this -aq a- is merely an idiomatic use of enclitic pronominal
-aq a- IT (VIS.); it has the position of a pronominal enclitic. T h a t it
is not to be merely construed as a pronominal object, properly speaking,
is shown by its use with inherently intransitive as well as transitive
verbs. On the other hand, it does not seem to occur where the verb
has a true pronominal object. Examples of imperative -aqa- are:

"
Mourning Ceremony     or ""Cry""118   As far east as the Paiutes of Muddy River, Nevada, and the Sibits of
St. George, but not as far as the Kaibab Paiutes, penetrated the annual
""Crying"" or Mourning Ceremony. This took place every summer (June
or July), rarely in the winter, and was intended to keep alive the memory
of dead relatives. Sacrifice was made by piling together in a heap objects
of value, such as blankets and baskets, also horses that had been shot,
and putting the whole on fire. An origin myth tells how the birds and
other animals, when they were people, came together long ago some-
where and bemoaned the fact that many were dying. The various animals
sang their characteristic mourning songs and these are now sung by the
Indians of today. In the ceremony four groups of singers are found,
each singing its characteristic songs. They are roan, coyote, birds (roost-
ers and others) and mountain sheep. These sets of songs are different
in general character and are accompanied by different motions. There
are over 200 of them. The ""roan"" songs all begin with the word wäEfm
and, like all the other songs, are composed of unintelligible words,
presumably Mohave. 119 The ""roan"" singers kneel facing each other, their
leader being in the center between the lines, and nowadays accompany
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes              835 their singing by means of tin cans filled with shot. They have a peculiar
 slanting downward motion of the hands. A man might join any group
 of singers, but only songs of a fixed kind were sung in any one group.
 Popular singers were paid for their services. The general expense of the
ceremony was born by two men, one of whom might be the brother of
a person that had died the preceding year. These visit the different
people of their own and neighboring bands and tell all to come together
at a certain place for the ceremony.
    A ""Cry"" lasts five days and nights. One person and another whose
relatives have died make arrangements for the dance, and pay for the
feast; they let everybody know about it. According to myth, the cere-
mony originated in California. 120 They sing till 12:00 at night. On the
last night, they sing up to morning. Then the clothes and blankets are
burned. Animals and horses (sometimes 100)121 are driven to the moun-
 tains and choked. ""Birds"" stand in the road and go back and forth.
 ""Coyotes"" jerk the right arm up and down to imitate the trotting of
 Coyote. ""Mountain sheep"" hold both hands in front and pull them up
 and down. ""Roan"" singers line up opposite each other and sit and stand
 alternately when tired. In the last night, people are not allowed to sleep.
About six officers keep them awake with pushing of a ""policeman's""
club. If one sleeps, he will get so sick that no medicine-man can cure
him. In the beginning of the dance, there is a cry of about ten minutes
at the command of a certain man, generally head of singing. Before
 that there is a ""friendship"" ceremony in which two parties of people
 face each other. People arrive at the meeting-place agreed upon in
 several parties. When the second party arrives they all dismount from
 their horses and line up to face a line composed of those who have
already arrived. The two lines approach each other and shake hands
and sing a song of friendship. The Cry leader goes around and tells
people about dead relatives to make them feel bad. [See Figure 13.]
Two girls back up towards the center line; the leader and assistant face
the girls. Home people gradually come closer and visiting people follow,
four in flank (not file). The leader explains his circuit around the center
line. As soon as he reaches the center, he tells them to go ahead and
cry. They cry two or three minutes. The leader sings together with four
while moving and circuiting. There is no particular time for making the
three center lines.
    A ""period"" of a roan song should be sung in one single breath,
otherwise the continuity of the song is broken. A new breath is taken
just before the second waiün. While a song is sung, the leader is already
836                      X Southern   Paiute and Ute
thinking of the next one, so that there is only a short pause before it.
As a rule, he tries to have each song sung only once during the night.
Once it is started again, it should be finished anyway.
   Some roan songs have many words with long periods. Such are not
apt to be as well known as others, only the leaders being entirely familiar
with them. The others would try to follow the leaders, keep up for
awhile, and lose the thread towards the latter part of the period.
   The annual Cry is said by a myth to have been introduced into the
Sibit122 (St. George) country by two old women long ago. They may be
seen as two rocks on opposite sides of the Virgin River a little below
Virgin City.
   The ""new way"" of singing certain songs was first heard by Tony at
a dance held at East Fork [of the Sevier River] in Escalante country by
a St. George man in 1901.
   In the ""Cry"" dance many bands participated together at a certain
place agreed upon, differing for each time perhaps; everyone had to be
let know about it before the party came to their particular place. The
""song leader"" and ""speech leader"" are separate people appointed before;
each group of songs has its leader.
   Some good ""Cry"" singers of the Muddy River Indians can dream
their songs, like the Mohave.
   [There should be payment] in the case of a song leader in a cry dance.
In the ""cry"" of 1901 held at East Fork [of the Sevier River], the song
leader was from St. George or Muddy River. No payment was agreed
upon beforehand; after the ceremony he was given payment. The pay-
ment used not to be great; anything at all would do that would show
his services were appreciated. If he were not paid, he would say nothing,
but the next time one of his band was requested to be a song leader,
they would refuse to do anything for stingy people.
   Some of the ""cry"" songs belonged together in a set of two or three
and were sung together. Such were called ""brothers."" As a rule, there
was no fixed order to the songs; they might follow in any order as
determined at the moment by the song leader. There was no particular
length to a ""cry"" song. If they came to the end of a ""set of periods,""
the leader might tell them to go ahead and continue the song.
   No mistake must be made in the singing of a ""Cry"" song. If one
makes an error, he will waste away with consumption.
   The leader has a rattle of a baking powder can filled with shot, held
in the right hand as a rattle.123
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic   Field   Notes         837Cry Dance of 1901   In 1901, Tom and Joe P ' ^ a x w i t ' 1 (both of Kanab) gave the Cry
dance for Tom's father who died two or three years ago. Joe was Tom's
uncle, brother of the deceased (the deceased man was not a chief, but
was rich and considered rather prominent). In the fall of 1900 council
was held at Kanab (niäviqwaix y ap' 'council'; niäviampayai' 'talk in
council'; women may talk in council, but hardly ever do). Mamputs
had come from Escalante in order to arrange for the Cry. It was arranged
to have the Cry in July of 1901. Tom had dropped a hint but not
explicitly said he would have a Cry; the hint was carried abroad to the
Arizona Paiutes and Muddy Rivers; in council all were Kanabs except
Mampiifs and assistant who went along with him. They met at the main
camp (of Young William with whom Tom was staying), but there was
no particular rule about the place of meeting. Tom was asked if he
would have a Cry; Tom then addressed the assembly and indirectly
asked Frank Mustache of St. George if he would get singers, whereupon
Frank said he would do what he could and, if some St. George person
would not act as song leader, he would be willing to do so. Frank said
he would see to it and get a ""whole set"" of St. George people to help
 — one for talker, one for roan song leader (Tom Rice), and one for
assistant roan song leader (Sally Rice, Tsäxuts), while for other songs
(bird and coyote songs, greeting song) they expected to get help from
Muddy River, also roan singer from St. George (John Domingo); the
bird song leader of Muddy River, who used to be St. George, named
Wcanuxqwemi ~ W e an e nq wemi 'Bent Penis,"" coyote song leader of Muddy
River who was once of St. George was named Pävuts 'Little Spring (?)',
the greeting song man from Muddy River named ' wo ""tsf'. After the day
was set for the Cry, letters were written to Cedar City (Captain Peter124
is chief of the Cedar City band, of whom there are now about 30) and
to St. George. News came from St. George that they would come for
the Cry and all were looking forward to the Cry in July at YiVimparir
'East Fork' [of the Sevier River] (name = 'stream of water at which
pines end'), because Tom's father used to live around there (Escalante
band, dialect probably more like Cedar City; Q' u 'cärump' people at
Grass Valley [on the Sevier], chief Oäqar). Everybody saved money to
dress well (but absolutely no Indian finery) for a great time.
  The Kanab Indians in the middle of June camped about one or two
miles east of Kanab, getting ready for the Cry (at a place called
W e aqoa + aitc' 'cedar grove bend, semi-circular cedar grove', where there
838                      X Southern   Paiute and Ute
was much good grass for pasture). Word was sent by one man to St.
George; he came back before July and said that many Muddy River
Indians would in two days come to St. George and that both bands
would then come together to Kanab. Then a man from St. George
(Pävuts) arrived at Kanab late in June; he came first in order to eat
rabbits with the Kanab people (not many rabbits around St. George;
in earlier days they used to hunt for rabbits around Mt. Trumbull); he
led in coyote and bird singing by way of preliminary in the evenings.
About July 5th or 6th, Frank Mustache went out very early to meet
the St. George and Muddy River Indians; he came back before noon
and reported that he had met them about nine at Pipe Spring (m""tiq' w
'mountain point running out into plain') and accompanied them for
some distance and that by noon they would be at the small town named
""Fredonia'"" 25 about 12 miles south of Kanab (called Ätsqav). Tom and
Joe started out immediately on Frank's report towards Fredonia, where
they met them, returned with them in the afternoon, led them to camp,
and went over to their own people. There were about 150 guests, of
whom about 85 were of St. George (only men and women, no children).
If they had not been met on the road by Tom and Joe, they would
naturally have been insulted at the slight. Then immediately upon arrival
(about 5 p.m. of July 7th), before putting up tents or even unhitching
horses, ""greeting"" took place at which 'wc""tsiS1 was leader (Tom Rice
and two girls served as assistants; this was the only time when Tony
noticed assistants at a Cry, but he had only witnessed one other). As
soon as they cried, they broke up, attended to the horses, and put up
tents. That evening they had bird singing with ""Broken Penis"" as leader
until midnight (nearly all bird songs and some roan songs were new
songs that were composed by Muddy River Indians, chiefly by one
certain man indefinitely referred to as Tant'ivwaiwiaYant"" 'western
singer'; some were entirely new, others were new versions of old songs;
coyote songs were almost all old ones). For about two nights after there
was no singing nor anything during the day. On the third day after
arriving all three bands proceeded northeast to East Fork. They camped
the first night at Skürumpä (English name;126 called in Paiute: Squr-
umpa £ ya' 'mouth of rabbit-bush canyon'; sqümp™ 'rabbit bush',
-tümpa'ya' 'mouth of canyon'), where there is a ranch. No singing was
done that evening. The next day they went on again and camped in a
canyon called Tc' ax qöarumpätc' 'Wild Geese Spring'. That evening they
sent two men — Paria John (Kanab Indian named Yin'ivwuts 'Bald
head'); the other man was an Arizona Paiute who lived with the Kanabs
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes            839because of marriage with a Kanab woman, named Tivwik'y 'Dirty
Ground mixed with sticks clinging to brush' — on to East Fork to the
other camp (Cedar City, Arizona Paiutes, and Grass Valley Indians,
and some Shoshone from Western Utah; about 300 or more altogether).
They arrived on horseback in the middle of the night at East Fork,
where a round dance was being held; they informed them of the arrival
of the western bands; they returned the next day and met the Kanab
and two other bands at noon little more than halfway between ""Wild
Geese Spring"" and East Fork, accompanied by most of the Arizona
Paiutes (Mamputs had been at East Fork but had already left because
he got mad at something). All together now started off, the Arizona
Paiutes going on ahead. When two miles from East Fork camp, all of
the three first bands stopped and dressed; there they were met by
Pyravurav11 'Flour Arm' (not regularly sent but came on his own
account; he was a St. George Indian who had married a Kanab woman;
some Kanabs already had come to East Fork). They went on from
there and came in sight of the main camp about four or five o'clock.
The East Fork people already were in a line (row), also three other
bands advanced in flank motion. The latter got off and advanced to
within about 100 yards of the other line. (When about a half mile from
East Fork and already in flank form, old William circled around on his
horse and addressed them. Tony does not remember what was said. The
same flank movement and prepared line had been followed at Kanab.)
The second greeting took place under the leadership of 'w*'tsi"", who
sang a different song this time. The horses were unhitched and put out
to pasture, and camps erected; they started in to sing about 7 or 8 after
supper. There were three groups of singers — roan, bird, and coyote —
not disposed in any formal order. All three had rattles; there was no
difference in the form of the rattles. The three groups sang ahead
regardless of each other; they quit at about midnight. There is no regular
rule about singers; they can stop at any time or join one of the other
groups. No dancing was done during the singing.
   The roan singers line up in two rows who face each other, the leader
being in the center of one of the rows. Part of the time they kneel, part
of the time they stand, according to the precedent set by the leader.
Bird singers always stand, also in two rows facing each other; they move
back and forth in flank formation somewhat in Bear Dance style, but
not with so lively a step; they gently shuffle along (feet slid forward
slightly alternately), at the same time slightly and gently bending or
swaying the body forward; the rattle in the right hand is gently moved
840                      X Southern   Paiute and Ute
obliquely down to right as it is held in front slightly to left, while the
palm of the left, elbow bent, is held out facing in and made gently to
follow the rattle movement by moving from up left to down right; the
rattle is allowed to touch the palm at each beat. Bird singers cover a
distance of about 30 to 40 feet. Coyote singers stand or kneel like roan
singers, with no characteristic motion (?). Mountain sheep always stand
but do not move, and never kneel. (Both Coyote and Mountain sheep
singers face each other in two rows.) They hold fists out with flexed
elbows and move them down parallel to each other. Mountain sheep
singers were had only the last night in 1901. Various groups of singers
not called ""coyotes"" or ""birds."" 127 Those not singing can do as they
please — talk, sit about a campfire. The singers are in the center of the
dance ground; the campflres were at the edge of the dance ground all
about (about eight of them). The camps were always put up in the
direction of the dance ground from which that particular party came;
the dance ground was a clear acre flat surrounded by big pines. Singing
was done during five nights, including the first on arrival. Nothing
much was done before noon; good times (Bear dances, Round dances,
foot races, horse races, wrestling, target shooting, card gambling) took
place on the third day after arrival; the Bear Dance was held twice; the
Round Dance on the second evening (when they had no cry singing);
foot races and target shooting were held on the fourth day; gambling
of course at any time. On the third, fourth, and fifth nights there was
""cry"" singing again; the same songs were sung, but not necessarily in
the same order. These last three nights the ""talker"" went about on the
dance ground and talked out loud to the people, reminding them of
their dead relatives and trying to make them sad. At the end of every
five roan songs, there is a slight pause during which an abbreviated cry
greeting takes place. All the people, also the non-roan-singers, join the
roan singers and make up two long lines who face each other. The
greeting leader comes in in the center, sings, and tells them to cry (no
hand-shaking or moving about); it was said that to cry after every four
songs would be too much of a strain on the people. Only during the
""cry"" part in the evening are there officers; there were two for Kanab
and one for each of the other bands. These were to see to it particularly
that no young couples went off sparking in the brush; in earlier days
they had no officers but complaints were made by the older Indians
about the loose conduct of the younger men, so they introduced officers
who had clubs or sticks, but did not generally need to use them. In the
last night, singing is kept up until dawn, when the burning has finished.
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic   Field   Notes        841Everyone must be awake during the whole of this night. In the early
morning, as soon as everything is burned, they all separate, the ""cry""
being finished.
   In 1901 the burning pile was erected about 100 yards east of the
dance ground; this was done in the afternoon of the last day. Meanwhile,
offerings for the burning were made. Anyone would stretch out a rope
between two trees and different people would suspend various articles
of value (such as baskets, silk handkerchiefs, shawls, blankets, and other
articles of clothing) from it; several such ropes would be stretched. All
articles suspended on a rope are meant to be sacrificed to the dead
relatives of the donor. Also, horses are tied by ropes to the trees and
are considered sacrifices in the same way. A certain man has been
chosen to conduct this part of the ceremony and to talk out to the
people. As soon as an offering has been made, the original owner has
no further claim to it, no matter how valuable it is; he has already done
his share for the sake of his dead relative. After the offerings have been
made, the man chosen for the ceremony talks to the people and tells
them they may exchange if they wish. This seems to have been done
chiefly with horses; if a very good horse has been offered, a man (not
the sacrificer) may come and unhitch it and tie a poorer horse of his
own in its place, which poorer horse will then be sacrificed in its stead,
the good one now belonging to the exchanger. There was one Kanab
man who sacrificed a good horse (he had no poor ones); a friend of his
substituted a broncho of his own; when they got back home, he returned
the good horse to its original owner of his own accord. This was
considered perfectly proper. The sacrificer had shown his readiness to
part with something valuable, while his friend had helped him out by
saving the good horse for him; both received credit for their acts. Also,
blankets might be exchanged, though apparently less frequently than
with horses. As soon as the exchanging is over, the articles sacrificed
are worn during that night for the last time by anyone who happens to
take each first; the same object may be worn by different people by
turns. An object, particularly such as a handkerchief, may be torn up
into little strips and worn by different people (first one man might tear
off a strip, then another, and so on until it is all torn up).
   During the last part of the singing during the night, the woodpile is
set on fire. When the roan singers have begun their very last song, all
the four groups of singers get up and slowly shuffle on in flank formation
towards the woodpile, keeping on singing, while all the other people go
along in the same direction. As soon as they arrive at the burning pile,
842                       X Southern   Paiute and   Ute
all the sacrificed articles being worn are thrown into the fire; at the
same time the sacrificed horses have been led up to a neighboring
mountain and are shot. At the burning other articles not already put
on a rope may be sacrificed. Thus one girl from Kanab, who had put
on two dresses, took off the upper one and threw it into the fire. Crying
goes on during the burning, also the roan singing. As soon as the singing
is over, the ceremony is at an end, and everyone seems to be eager to
get away as soon as possible.
   At the time of the Cry of 1901, Tom, who had learned much from
the Utes, led in a peculiarly Ute (not Paiute) ""dance."" A line of horsemen
riding bareback with ropes for reins circled around clockwise, two
moving abreast. Tom, the leader, held a drum made of a pail with a
piece of buckskin stretched over the opening in his left and beat it with
a drumstick held in his right. They all sang to his drumming. This is
the only drum Tony has ever heard of in use among the Paiutes. 128
   The object of the ""cry"" is to show respect for dead relatives; there is
no idea of sending property to the spirit world, but goods are sacrificed
merely to show love and disregard of wealth for their sake. There is no
necessity of sacrificing if you don't want to, but it would look mean if
one did not sacrifice at least something, even if only a trifle, if a relative
has recently died. It is enough to sacrifice at the first ""cry"" after a death,
not necessarily thereafter. A ""cry"" can be held anytime, but is generally
held in summer (June or July). About 1898 (latter part of July), a ""cry""
was held about 6 or 8 miles below Cedar City (Muddy, St. George,
some Shoshone, Kaibab, Escalante, Cedar, but no Arizona [people were
present]); about 1904 (some time in May), a ""cry"" took place between
""Cain Patch"" 129 and Rockville at Siümpäts ~ Ciümpäts 'gravel spring'
(St. George, Kanab, and Cedar only); about 1903 (November), a ""cry""
was held at Point Spring (Pav(/aväts) at the Indian pasture near (three
miles east of) Moccasin Spring (only Kanab); in 1902 (early in spring)
a ""cry"" was held at Oäitümpai'yc< 'mouth of Salt canyon' (directly east,
about seven miles from Moccasin Springs, at Point Spring, on road to
Kanab and just outside of Indian pasture) (only Kanab); in 1899 a
""cry"" was held seven miles west of Kanab at Cottonwood Springs in
winter (only Kanab); about 1904 (July) a ""cry"" was held at gati' 'end
of canyon' about 30 — 40 miles northwest of St. George (Mt. Meadow
is about 15 miles south of it) (all bands); in 1909 (July), a ""cry"" was
held at the same place as in 1898 (all bands except Arizona, also some
Shoshones); before 1894 two ""cries"" were held at Sam City.130 Utes
never come to ""cries"" nor other tribes besides those above enumerated.
                     Kaibab   Paiute Ethnographic   Field   Notes   843Ghost   Dancem   In the Ghost Dance they used to have a dance-corral or fence
(generally, but not always) consisting of cedar or preferably willow
branches piled thick and neatly to a height of four or five feet, with
four gates or openings about four feet wide, the diameter of the circle
being about 60 — 75 feet. Planted in the center they used to have a cedar
pole about 25 feet high, from the top of which depended a string to
which two feathers were tied, one a big eagle tail-feather painted red,
the other one of the soft white feathers under an eagle's tail-feather.
There was no restriction about touching the pole. Instead of the pole,
the prophet whose dreamt songs were sung would put a cane of service-
berry wood smoothed nicely and symmetrically with a carved hook or
knob at the top in the center; from it the same two feathers hung. 132
Only the prophet (pärüxuts, now used also to mean anyone that com-
poses a Round Dance) could touch the cane and feathers; when the
dance was over he took it home with him and stood it up at the doorway
or at the head of his bed, where nobody could touch it. Several prophets
had canes and feathers, some of whom were Kaibabs. Tony was then
about five years old. They generally started about 7 p.m. and kept it
up till midnight. The dancing kept up day after day for many months,
perhaps a year or two. Nothing was done during the day. Everyone was
supposed to go to the dance, otherwise he would turn into a crow,
stone, or some other animal or object. During the dance, the prophets
would suddenly fall into a trance and, on awakening, prophesy various
things, such as the approach of a storm; they claimed that if the people
danced, their dead relatives would come back to life. Now the Indians
do not like to sing these songs, for they claim the dances ""ate up"" the
people, all the prophets having died, probably from over-exertion.
Dancing was done clockwise in the same manner as an ordinary round
dance. There were no special costumes worn for the ghost dance.","[838, 839, 840, 841, 842, 843, 844, 845, 846, 847]"
"  (β) A few examples have been found in which the incorporated
noun has similative significance. It is quite doubtful if such can be
considered as representing a distinct type. Examples are:

  More common than verbs with incorporated noun subjects are
noun-functioning participles of such verbs (see 1, b).
   (ζ) Examples of the use of the incorporated noun as a predicate
of the subject are:

  A STICK. The distinction between types (T) and (ζ) is perhaps
  somewhat arbitrary.
   (??) The use of the incorporated noun as a predicate of the object
is not very common. Examples are:

   Enclitics, as already pointed out (§ 17, 2), may be attached to any
word in the sentence. The pronominal enclitic elements will be
treated later in connection with the independent personal pronouns
(§ 40). Here we shall discuss only enclitics of adverbial significance.
Except in certain specified cases, they regularly precede pronominal
enclitics.
   ( 1 ) ENCLITICS OF TEMPORAL SIGNIFICANCE.           T W O enclitic   elements
are used to refer to past time.
   (a) -tea-, -ntca-. This element refers to the recent past and is
often best translated by the English perfect. For the forms -tea',
•ntca' see § 7. Examples are:
tona't-ϊ team I have been hit
tavL tsdea rjani pAxqa'yuni having-hit-past-he-me kill-me; having hit
   me, he killed me (note t h a t -tea- here refers not to tavi'tsi- HAVING
   HIT, but to following pA'qa'rju- KILL)
witn""tsiatca r) qo'q wi bird- obj.-past- he shoot, he shot the bird
wa'qutcani qava 'x A two-obj.-past- I horse receive, I received two
   horses
tona'ntcani I struck (not long ago)

88                                SAPIRimi'ntca' pi'pi'tci thou-past arrive, you arrived
u(w)a'n oyuntcA paiyu'yu over there-past return, has been there and
  returned from there
  If a pronominal enclitic is used possessively with the preceding
noun, the enclitic -(n)tca- follows (aside from -φϊ ONE'S OWN), e. g. :mqa'n intc ai)A mompa'qu father-my-past he roll-off, my father rolled
  off
but:
o·'cdsa r)a4>i quM"" arrow-obj.-past- he-own take, he took his own arrow   With interrogative ai- (§ 44, 2, c) -tea- apparently refers to present
time, e. g. a'iicarjWA WHERE IS HE? but there is probably an implied
reference to the past, e. g. WHERE HAS HE (GONE TO) ? It is sometimes
used with exhortative ivw'i- (§ 60,2,d), e. g. Wi'tcan ixa'"" LET-PAST-ME-
THEN, LET ME THEN!   (b) -ywa-, a general preterital element referring to more remote
time than -(n)tca-. For the form -ywa' see § 7. Examples are:
pA'qa'rpiywarjani I killed him (narrative form; contrast pA'qa'-
    rjuntca rjani I have killed him [just now])
rii'xwa'aqwA pA'qa'rjv I-past-him kill, I killed him
αη ι'αχιυ aiv'i qa'ya' what-past would-say while-singing? what did
   he sing?
aija'x uru""a who-past he? who was he? (-a: < -xw; § 13, 7, c)
rii'ywa' to'nA I-past punch, I punched (long ago)
  That -ywa- is no true tense suffix is shown by the fact that it may
be used with the verbal -y'i- suffix of present time (see § 32, 1), e. g.:
imi'xwar'uaqA      man'yqaiyiaq-A thou-past-interrogative-it create-
   present-it? didst thou create it?
ivi'yixwa j-ayA drink-present-past-it-he, he drank it (long ago)
   A broken form -ywa'a- (perhaps -ywa- + -a-, 3) also occurs.
Its morphology is not clear. Examples are:
iim'tsiywa'an wo""a 'ni then-past-I there-I, then I was there
ni'niaxwa'axain i qari'i' me-past-too sit-present, I too was seated
imi'axwa'axain i qan'i' thee-past-too-sit-present, you too (it was said)
   were seated

examples see § 39, 4.
  ( 2 ) ENCLITICS OF MODAL AND SENTENCE-CONNECTIVE SIGNIFICANCE.
Several of these are used in idiomatic connections that do not readily
yield insight into their primary significance. I t is believed, however,
that the chief elements and uses are given below.
  (a) -yainta-, -ayainta- TOO, ALSO. These elements always follow
pronominal enclitics, when present. The form -ayain ia- is probably
compounded of -a- (see 3, a below) and -yain ta-; it is not at all clear
how it differs in use or meaning from -yain• ια-.^γαϊη • ia- itself is perhaps
compounded of -πια- (see d below). Examples of -yainta- ALSO, TOO
are:
rii'xain i I too
uijwa'c • uywain ι that one too
cv'yuxwain i still another one
riimy'i%aint     we (exclusive) too
tFqa'xw'aivanixaini     I also will go to eat
  Examples of -ayain-ia- TOO are:
riiywi'axaini ya'a'ilfa' person-too died
marja'iAcuaxain i urjwaru"" aru""anA his-too he-is being, he belongs to
   him too
  Sometimes -{a)yainta-     is elided to -(a)yain·, e. g.:
rii'axain   y/tu'va n i I-too will-do
    A frequent modal use of -yainta- is to indicate a somewhat un-
expected inference or an emphasis on an idea that might be questioned.
I t may then be rendered IT TUHNED OUT, IT SEEMS, INDEED, JUST.
Examples are:
mari'acuxwainC         qant'ptnt    naya'<j>Axqafpiya' that (house) -it-
    turned-out old-abandoned- house-like seemed
qan i'am 'ixain i απϊ house-their-it-seems it; their house, as it seems

90                                SAPIR     An example of doubly elided -yain- is:
a'in'mayaxain·     'a'ik -A that-he-indeed said, that is what he did say
  (b) -ya'a- THEN ! INDEED. This element, which follows pronominal
enclitics, has emphasizing force. I t is particularly common in
optative and hortatory sentences. Examples are:
ρα'α'ίχ.υ·η·ΐχα' 'oai' die-would-I-indeed (for 'oat' see § 60, 3), would
  that I might die!
paiyi'k• ujur/jv ijwaxa' 'oai' return-hither-momentaneous-would-he-in-

  first- house-make-go; go ahead, then, over there and first make a
  house
mv,ayaya '''xa'a that one, indeed
  (c) -ywa- SHOULD, OUGHT. This enclitic is doubtless identical
with preterital -ywa- (1, b above). When used as modal enclitic of
obligation or in mild imperatives, it is followed by enclitic -noa- (see
e below). Examples are:
(•u)mwaniiJfaim iaywar'iianoA thus- resultative-usitative-should- in-
   terrogative-probably; that is not how one should act, be
mwan Mvim iaywar'uan oA dit. except that -avi- ΤΟ LIE is substituted
   for resultative -lp ai-\ one should not be thus lying
qari""miaxwa'n oA sit-usitative-should-thou-probably, you shall stay
Wi'xwa yan oA go-ahead-should-him-probably, go ahead and—him!
   (d) -n ia- LIKE. This is one of the most constantly recurring
enclitics. Though its primary significance is that of resemblance,
it is employed in several fairly distinct nuances of meaning and
enters into many idiomatic turns of expression. Its primary meaning
is clearly illustrated in:
-ψΐί'ο ηπί naya'p a rjupiya' thus-again-like appeared, (it) looked just
   like before
αχα'ηϊηίαηι naya'<j>Axqa* how-like-I appear? what do I look like?
so ""itsini like a soldier
rmt'an in i like my father (note that -n ia- follows possessive -n i-
   my, but precedes subjective or objective pronominal enclitic; cf.
   second example above)

rendered IT SEEMS, AS IT W E R E , AS THOUGH, e. g.:
pAxqa'yufi'qanfinia ' j a-/)A naya'vai' kill-passive-having-been-like-it-he
  seems, it seems that he has been killed, it looks as though he has
  been killed
qu'qwt'va p 'iyain'ni'aywA shoot-future-past-like-him, acted as though
  about to shoot him
άηα'ψυανϊηι coyote, it seems
  This dubitative tinge may become so deepened as to justify the
rendering of -nia- as PERHAPS, e. g.:
ti'ma'q Aqain an ιαταη 'urjwA roast-plural subject-perfective-verbal
   noun-like-our he, perhaps the one whom we have roasted
u'u'rjwani'aml tini'arjqiq a'aiml he-like-thee tell-to-perfective-thee,
   maybe he has been telling you
  The idea of resemblance may also shade off into that of limit or
emphasis, e. g.:
fina '""va ntim anatjqwan-laqA    bottom-at-being-from-like-its, from its
   very bottom
  A number of verbs, chiefly such as indicate states of mind, are
regularly used with enclitic -N IA-, e. g. fiijw'i-. . .nia- ΤΟ HURRY;
                           'i'itampaqa-. . .n ia- ΤΟ BE TIRED OF; at-. . .n ia- ΤΟ THINK (lit., ΤΟ
SAY, AS IT W E R E ; cf. ai- ΤΟ SAY); ar/waiya-. . .nia- TO BE DIZZY;
an-ia-q-a-. . .n ia- WHAT DOES ONE CARE? (cf. an ia- WHAT? § 44, 1, d);
nanicui-. . .η·ία- ΤΟ BE FIERCE; i-ywaru'a-qai- . . .n ia- ΤΟ BE
WILLING, READY. Here belong also many verbs of sound or sound-
imitation, e. g. ampaiya-. . .n-ia- ΤΟ MAKE A NOISE; so a-. . .n-ia-
TO   SOUND   LIKE   FLOWING   WATER; OTD O-. . .N IA- TO     BUZZ,   HUM;
oq w'e-. . .n ia- ΤΟ SOUND LIKE COUGHING; and numerous sound-verbs
with suffixed durative -ya- (see § 30,1). For -»-{β- with numeral stems,
see § 36, 1; with certain postpositions, § 50, 4: 7, 35, 39; with certain
adverbs, § 60, 1.
  Quite unclear is -n'nia- following demonstrative ai- (§ 43, 5) in
cases like:
a'in'niayaxain- 'a'ik -A that-like (?) -he- indeed said, that is what
   he did say
   Its glottal stop is unexplained.

definite significance to this enclitic. I t seems to render a statement
either more doubtful or less definite in application. I t may have an
i m p e r s o n a t i n g function. I t is nearly always combined with either
modal -ywa- (see c above) or with an impersonal -tua- (§ 29, 14) in
its own or the following word. Examples of the former have been
already given; see also -cuya-ywa-noa-             (h below). When combined
with pronominal enclitics, -n oa- regularly follows except in the case
of -η ί- I, ME, which it precedes. Examples of -n oo- with 4 ua- are:

   somebody-shall, I don't care if you are struck
   An example of -re-οα- unaccompanied by either -ywa- or impersonal

momentaneous -qi- (§ 30, 3). The form of the stem is regularly
durative, i. e. with ungeminated consonant. For a change of the
singular vowel to -i- in the plural, see § 53, 1, b. Examples are:

  A number of verbs in -n'na- are formed from noun and adjective-
verb stems to express the idea of LAYING ON, PAINTING, e. g.:
arjqa- to be red                     aijqa'n' NA'p'Cya'aik-WA (he) paint-
                                        ed it (primarily, but not neces·

   Not all verbs have a definite temporal form. The use of absolute
or tenseless verb forms is discussed in § 51, 2. Besides the temporal
suffixes here discussed, two of the enclitic elements express temporal
relations (§ 19, 1).
   (1) -y'i- present tense. The great majority of verbs express a
specific reference to present time by means of this suffix. Examples
are:

pu'tcu'tcuywa-       to know            pu'tcu'tcuywa'yiqwA       knows it
   (2) -q a- present and past tense. A number of verbs, some of
them of extremely common occurrence, are used not with -y'i-, but
with -q a-, which refers indifferently to present or past time. Perhaps
the -q a- forms are best considered as the equivalents of tenseless
absolutes in other verbs. These verbs are αϊ- ΤΟ SAY, ania- ΤΟ SAY
WHAT?, verbs of doing in -wi- (§ 26, 2, b; § 43, 3), and diminutive
verbs in -(n)tsi- (§ 35, 2). Examples are:
      to sav                            'ani'cen 'a'ik-^A      what-I said?;

preterital element, its main point of difference from enclitic -(n)tca-
and -ywa- (§ 19, 1) being its emphasis on the idea of completion.

"  ( 2 ) U S E OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.
  (a) In perhaps the majority of cases the substantive verb follows
and is phonetically disconnected from its predicate noun or subject;
an adverb, however, may precede and the predicate noun follow the
verb. In these cases the final vowel of the word preceding the
substantive verb is elided. Examples are:
cina'rjwav aru""a coyote it-is
''itc aro""ami' qa'tcu quna""ap-A this (inan.) be-usitative not fire-
    negative, this (that we have been burning) is not fire

 'a'(i)yuxvp·   vruru""ai'   good-irrealis-past passive partic. it-is (inv.)-
    present, it would be good
   (b) A second method of employing substantive verbs is to attach
them to the preceding predicate noun or subject (noun or independent
pronoun), a glottal stop separating the a- or u- of the substantive
verb from the preceding final vowel, which is preserved; e. g. iici'
'aru'a- this (inan.) i s beside ''itc aru'a-. Perhaps such forms as iter'
'am'a- may be considered as verbs with incorporated nominal (or
pronominal) subject (§ 18, 2, f, t); e. g. Hci""aru'a~, cinaywavi'urywaro'a-.
Forms of this type are obligatory for independent pronouns of the
first and second persons. Examples are:
sari 'tcL dro'"" dog it-is
na'a'ints tsi' aru'"" little-girl it-is (absolute: na'a'intsits )
imi"" 'aru' umwa'niqaii)ä nfi thou art thus-resultative-future-parti-

   (c) The idea of B E I N G OF, B E L O N G I N G TO is normally expressed, as
illustrated above in several examples, by preceding the substantive
verb with an objective form of genitive significance, e. g.:
ni'niaru' aro' aro""anA me-interrogative is being, is it being of me?
   is it my property?
n\'ni \waru"""" me he-is, he is mine
imi' 'uraru"" (aru""anA) thee it-is (being), it is yours
  By a curious idiom, however, the logical owner is sometimes put
in the subjective, the thing owned in the objective, as though the
substantive verb were to be translated directly as ΤΟ OWN, e. g.:
itci'an aro""ai' this (inan.)-obj.-I be- present, this is mine, I own this

There are commonly used constructions in Paiute that are analogous
to such English locutions as IT IS I WHO — with predicate pronoun,
except that there is no substantive verb expressed, the IT doing
service for it. The pronominal form for IT employed in Paiute is
the inanimate visible enclitic, -aq a-. I t is regularly preceded, it
would seem, by enclitic -a-, - a- (§ 19, 3, a). There is always a

252                                   SAPIRstrong emphasis on the independent pronoun to which the -aqa- is
attached. Examples are:
rii'a q- 'oai' I-α- it (vis.), it is I (for 'oai' see § 60, 3)
imi'ni(y)a q· ucu       thou-like-it, maybe it is you (-niaq- probably <

"(1)   MODIFICATIONS OF      a:   (a) Palatalization.  After a syllable containing i, a is frequently
palatalized to ö (as in English hat) or, still further, to ε (as in English
met). This takes place particularly when a directly follows i (with
or without glide y, see § 14, 2), or when ν intervenes. Examples are:

  (b) Dulling to a. Dulling to a (like u of English but) is extremely
common, particularly in unaccented syllables. I t seems to take place
chiefly before or after nasal consonants (m, n, y):

ο of the preceding or following syllable; this ω was not always care-

gutturals (q, y, yq) immediately preceded by a and ο respectively.
ai is quite frequently heard as äi, ει or as ""i, 'i with rather fleeting
glide-like α or ε; 'ί is sometimes heard still further reduced to ϊ (see
b). After a + labialized guttural i > ai may be labialized to oi, 'i

but regularly count in accentual phenomena as simple vowels (see

   (b) Dulling to i, ϊ. After is, i is regularly dulled to i, a high un-
rounded ""mixed"" vowel (to use Sweet's terminology) that sounds
acoustically midway between ι and ϊ. I t has been often recorded
simply as i, sometimes also, though exaggeratedly, as ϊ. Examples
are:

   More rarely i is gutturalized to i, i after guttural consonants
(?, 7. X, w ) . cf. (a) above:
-χι- to come in order to .                   tonaxiyiar/A he comes to punch
-q ι- hither                                 ya'qiyaq-A    bring it

   (c) Consonantizing before nasals. When standing before η or y
and coming after ts (sometimes modified to <·, see §13, 7, a), less often
after q, i not infrequently loses its vocalic character altogether and
assimilates to the following nasal, becoming syllabic ii or j (cf.
English ka'zy, from cousin):
     -Ui- gerundive + -ni- I                qa 'xa tsnnl being about to sing, I
     -ist- diminutive + -ni- my             witsit mu my great-grandchild
  (d) Consonantizing to y. Rather infrequently the combination i +
vowel, via i + glide y + vowel, simplifies to y + vowel, e. g.:
i(y)ä'nu- present here                      yanu-
compare u{w)a'nu-   P R E S E N T T H E R E > wa'nu- (see 5, a).","[25, 26, 27, 28]"
"  (1)    UNVOICING UNDER THE LAW OF ALTERNATING STRESSES.                We
may now state the full law of non-final unvoicing. Aside from the
next to the last mora, which is always preserved intact (owing to
the unvoicing of the following mora), every weak mora standing
before a geminated stop (p·; t·; t c, t s; q-, k·; q w, kw) or sibilant (c·, s·;
postvocalic sibilants are always to be understood as geminated) loses
its voice. A diphthong or long vowel can be partly unvoiced only
when its second mora is weak, as its first mora, if weak, is protected
from unvoicing by the vocalic second mora; similarly, a short-

40                                          SAPIR
voweled syllable with inherent glottal stop is always preserved, as it
can not lose both its moras. The weak second mora of an inherently
glottalized long vowel or diphthong or a weak-moraed vowel separated
from an immediately preceding vowel by a glottal stop is either
preserved or, at most, ""murmured"" (see § 8, 2, a, end; b, end; c, end).
The law of alternating stresses necessarily means that there is a
constant alternation of voiced and unvoiced (or murmured) vowels
in non-final syllables of related words. Examples are:

VOWELS. As we shall see later (§ 15, 2, a), a broken vowel (e. g.
a'a) constantly alternates with the types ' + vowel and vowel +
To a considerable extent, though not with absolute regularity, these
variations tend to adjust themselves to the law of alternating stresses.
The group v'v 1 tends to preserve that form, or its close variant v' v
(or v'), if the (first) ν is in a strong mora, but the form 'v (or V'v) if in
a weak one. In the latter case the ' may appear immediately before,
after, or welded with the preceding consonant. Initially after a
consonant -v'v- is usual. The form v'v applies both to one-moraed
groups broken from ν and to primary two-moraed groups. Examples
of alternation are:

   A parallel alternation is to be observed in the case of glottalized
diphthongs. Thus, a'(a)i appears either, with strong first mora, as
a'ai (or a'i), or, with weak first mora, as 'ai. Examples are:
-tjw(a)'ai-       together with          pavi'tsiywa 'αίφϊ       with his own

   Frequently, also, a weak-moraed vowel, particularly a or ϊ, is
elided before a glottal stop followed by a different vowel, e. g.:
m'a'      penis                           w(i)'a'pi     penis
   An initial (v)'v'- is either a broken v- (e. g. a'a't 'i-, (a)'a't t- GOOD)
or contracted from ν- + -'v-. There is no phonetic or mora-quantita-
tive difference between the two types. Examples of contracted
initial (ν) 'ν'- are:
u- that + - urai- toward                  u'u'ra', (U)'u'ra' toward it

zation or glides; e. g. in tcAHca'payaitcAzqainA     (ITS) HAVING BEEN
TORN τ ο PIECES, -yai- is developed from -yi- (see § 3, 2, a) and thus
counts for only one mora. On the other hand, in an example like
Vi'yqAxqaRi to run away hard, the short vowel of ti'- is only secondarily
shortened from a two-moraed ti- (cf. ti'ntoyoqwi      τ ο RUN HARD). A
few errors are sure to have crept in also; e. g. AKti' xiqaripiya'     SAT
NURSING, no doubt either misheard or misdictated for        A'ti'xiqampiya'.
   Aside from such only apparent examples, there are, however,
certain cases (apart from mwa'- THAT, already specified) of initial
short-voweled and non-glottalized syllables t h a t seem to count for
two moras and hence to bear the main stress. Of these, ti'campA
ALWAYS is evidently to be explained by reference to its less frequently
heard variant Tü'c ampA. Less easy to explain are:?'- in vain                             ϊ'ρ Ιη ίηηΐ     looks around in vain

but counts for two, not three, moras; e. g. ti'ywiRiqamtyanl I ALWAYS
EAT QUICKLY. Judging by ti'- < ti·'- (see above), %' - may be really
shortened from ϊ '-. As for fi'ra-, there has evidently been some
contraction, as we find pa-fi'yara-va' OUT IN THE RAIN (lit. WATER-
DESERT-AT), b u t fi'ra-va'   OUT IN THE OPEN.
   An interesting group of violations, or apparent violations, of the
law of alternating stresses is embraced by forms with secondarily
lost reduplicating syllable with voiceless vowel (cf. ti'campA < Tti'-
c ampA above). Such forms alternate with, though less frequent
than, intact reduplicated forms. Examples are:
pita'-    to arrive                       (pl')pi'tc'lplyd      arrived

qa'puHcuywaiui-      ΤΟ TEACH HOW TO SING <         qa'pu'tcutcuywafui-).
   An initial i- is sometimes lost before a following organic y. This
also brings about an only apparent violation of the law of alternating
stresses.
iyo'm- mourning dove                       yö'vi-
      (cf. Ute aiö'vi-)
   This is different from the consonantizing of prevocalic i and u to
y and w respectively (see § 3, 2, d; 5, a), where there is no real loss
involved. Initial ϊ of tyiR INDEED is frequently elided (see § 60, 3),
e. g.:
a'ia-τ) iy'iR that-he indeed (said)          a'ia rj gin
-χαίηια- too + iy'iR                        npiL αχινα χαίη ι %iR of me too
                                              indeed                          §11.   Loss of one or more moras.
  All the losses referred to in § 10, 2 and 3, are, in a sense, only
apparent, as they do not influence the original rhythmic framework
of the word. Fundamental alternations of mora-structure are,
however, also found, which follow the law of alternating stresses.
Certain words lose a mora in some, not necessarily all, compounds,
generally when occurring as the first element of a compound. Certain
suffixed elements, also, alternate between a longer and a shorter
form.
  Particularly common is alternation between a primary long and a
reduced short vowel. Examples are:
pa-      water                             pa- in compounds: pa-fi'ia- elk
                                              (lit., water-deer); pa-rfi'u- fish;

  An element containing a diphthong or two vowels in immediate
juxtaposition sometimes loses the second vowel, e. g. -yai- τ ο HAVE:
participial -ya-nfi- HAVING (see § 25, 6, a ) ; -qai- perfective: participial
-qa-ηΐΐ-   HAVING -ED (see § 25, 6, d ) ; -mia-       u s i t a t i v e : -mi-   (see § 3 0 , 1 0 ) .
   A post-consonantal vowel may also drop out, in which case the
preceding consonant also disappears or, if a nasal, may leave its
trace in the ""nasalizing"" power of the stem. Examples are:u-^una-       quiver                        un a'-:    y.na'viya- to put away a

"         (2) F R E E ADVERBS. The adverbs of free position may be classified
      into temporal adverbs, local adverbs, adverbs of degree, and modal
      adverbs. They are employed either as true adverbs (e. g. qi'arjwt.
      ya""a YESTERDAY DIE(D) ), often serving as bases for postpositional
      suffixes (e. g. qwa'utuyvia- OFF-TO, THE OTHER WAY < qwau- O F F ) ;
      or, in part, as verbs (this is particularly true of local adverbs, e. g.

iyiR INDEED, TRULY. This common adverb tends to amalgamate
   loosely with preceding personal pronouns, independent or enclitic.
   Thus, rii' iyiR is generally heard as m'iyiR; imi- iyiR appears as,
   not i'm 'iyiR, but imi'tyiR (in general, -i- iyiR becomes iyiR); -ay
   iyiR often coalesces to -ay g'iR (stopped g is sometimes heard for
   y in others of these cases also). Present forms tend to take on
   preterital significance with iyiR. Examples are:
      rii' 'iyiR nfna'c i I indeed dream-present, I did indeed dream

   force. I t is particularly common after iyiR (see above); with pre-
   terital -tea- and -γωα- (§ 19, 1); after gerund -t si- (§ 55, 1, a); in
   irrealis forms (§ 33, 1), particularly such as indicate unfulfilled

   By ""derivative suffixes"" are here understood such elements as have
derivational rather than purely formal or syntactic value, i. e. such
elements as help to build u p the word as such from the stem rather
than to relate the word to other words in the sentence. Under
formal suffixes are not here included strictly syntactic elements.

Derivative and formal suffixes may be grouped into seven more or less
clearly distinct types of elements. 1. Noun suffixes, including abso-
lutive or classifying elements, elements defining possession, and tense
elements; 2. Nominalizing suffixes, generally suffixed to verb stems,
embracing agentive, instrumental, and verbal noun suffixes, certain
special noun-forming elements, and participial suffixes; 3. Verbalizing
suffixes, affixed to nominal, adjectival, or demonstrative stems; 4.
Verbal derivative and formal suffixes, affixed to verb stems, embracing
suffixes of movement, voice, verbal aspect, number, tense, and mode;
5. Diminutive -(n)isi-, suffixed to both predicating and denominating
terms; 6. Numeral suffixes; 7. Quasi-pronominal suffixes of special
nature. In general it may be said that the derivative suffixes of
Southern Paiute are, on the whole, of a general and colorless rather
than of a specific or concrete nature.","[128, 129]"
"   (1) UNVOICING IN FINAL POSITION. The final unvoicing may be
either complete or partial, according to the nature of the final vowel
and the element preceding it. We must distinguish between final
short vowels and long vowels or diphthongs.
   (a) Treatment of short vowels. A final completely unvoiced vowel
always sounds distinctly breathy in quality and may, indeed, be
appropriately defined as aspiration with the vocalic timbre of the
originally voiced vowel. Very frequently the breath alone is heard,
the timbre not being always distinctly perceptible; i and u are the
clearest of the timbres, while unvoiced a and ϊ are not always easy
to detect. Where the timbre of the voiceless vowel is obscure, a
mere ' is used. A vowel or nasal (to, n, tj) preceding the unvoiced
vowel remain unaffected, though often the latter part of the nasal
is also voiceless. More rarely the nasal too is heard completely
unvoiced. A stopped consonant (including tc) becomes a strongly
aspirated surd (e. g. -pi > -p'l, indicated more simply as -pi). After a
q- or rjq, the final breath is sometimes sharpened to a glide * (e. g.
-aq a- > -aq-A, -aq·' or -aqxA, -aq z) \ after an anterior palatal k- or
i)jc, this glide is palatalized to a - (as in German ich; e. g. a'ik a-

I t is itself n o t t y p i c a l l y isolable as a separate element but appears
generally as a definite vocalic timbre of the unvoiced spirant; i. e.
such an orthography as -c u is to be interpreted as a long c with
simultaneous lip-rounding as for u. H o w e v e r , the independent

becomes a ""murmured"" vowel (indicated by superior vowels):

  Sometimes the murmured vowel is heard assimilated in quality to
the vowel preceding the glottal stop:
aru'a- to be                          aru'u (generally aru'"", aru'"")
üvwic-i'a- to pay                     üv w i'c i i
   If the word ends in a consonant + glottal stop + vowel (or, what
amounts to the same thing, consonant + vowel + glottal stop;
see § 15, 2), the final vowel appears fully voiced and followed by the
glottal stop + a murmured rearticulation or ""echo"" of the vowel
(cf. § 7, 1, end). Such syllables are two-moraed (see § 9). The
""echo"" is not always clearly perceptible. Examples are:
-n'ni- continuative suffix            ! ( » ' { • » ' ' several keep doing
paya'rj'wi-ni   my bowstring          paya'ywL ' bowstring
-upa-     through                     ma'upa'""          through there
   There is, however, a distinction in treatment between a glottal
stop that belongs properly to the final syllable, as in the above
examples, and one that, though it may actually appear in it, is not
organically of it but belongs properly to some part of the word
preceding the final syllable or is an accessory element (see § 15, 1).
In the latter case, the final vowel is unvoiced (better, probably,
whispered; cf. 2, a, end); indeed, a preceding nasal is in such cases
apt to be more completely unvoiced (whispered) because of the
presence of the glottal stop. Such syllables are one-moraed (see §
9). Examples are:
-n'na-   momentaneous                 ts-ka'p-m'NA      to cut something
                                         (cf. ts ka'vinA to be cutting)

                                         house
   (b) Treatment of w + short vowel. In words ending in a labialized
consonant {q ue, qqw, yw, ijw) + short vowel, both the w and the
vowel are unvoiced (unvoiced w is indicated as w). The preceding
q then becomes aspirated, y a lengthened x. Examples are:

-rjw'i- animate plural                 niTjw'i'ntslrjw'L men, Indians   (c) Treatment of y + short vowel. A final y + short vowel become
unvoiced to r + voiceless vowel (y is much lighter than ch of German
ich). Ordinarily, however, the r becomes a mere breath merged in
the following voiceless vowel. If the vowel preceding the y is α, ο, i, or
u, a clear i or ' is generally heard as voiced glide. T h e timbre of the
final vowel is least clear if reduced from ϊ; hence, final -y'i- appears
normally as -i\ -*' after all vowels but i, after which merely          is
ordinarily heard. Examples are:-qa- plural subject + -ya- plural      qa'qai(Y)A,      -qai'   sing y e !

pa'an i-   to be high +   -y'i-       pa'a'n i'      is high   A long a- or an ai before final y + vowel (and, indeed, before y +
vowel generally) are practically indistinguishable phonetically,
owing to the i- glide after a- and the tendency of α· and ai to break
up into aa and aai respectively (see § § 5, 1; 4, 2, b). Both appear
as aai, a i, or, very characteristically before final y + vowel, as a.i,
a true diphthong in which the a and i melt lazily into each other.
Hence a final -ai' < -a{i)-yi- is acoustically quite distinct from -ai',
-a.i' < -a -y'i- or -ai-y'i-; the former -ai' is sharp, the latter somewhat
languishing in character, though not necessarily so long as to deserve
the orthography -ai'.         Examples are:

   (e) Treatment of diphthongs.   All final i- diphthongs lose the second
mora, the -i, its place being taken by a breath. This breath has not
i- timbre. Examples are:
-p 'iyai- remote past                     a'ip 'iya' said
ανί'χαί-   while lying                     ανί'χα'

Note t h a t :
  original -ai- becomes final -a'
  original -a-y'i- becomes final -ai'
  original -ai-y'i- becomes final -a.i'
   Final glottalized diphthongs (see § 15, 2, a), aside from -ο'(ο)ι-,
retain the -i as a "" m u r m u r e d "" vowel (see a above), e. g. causative
-<•«'·; A1q;>""i SEVERAL SLEEP < Axqn'(p)i-. Final -a'(a)i-, however, is
treated analogously to -ai-, i. e. -i is lost without trace and the then
final glottal stop is followed by a "" m u r m u r e d "" "":

  Final -au- is treated like -a—|—u-,          i. e. the -u- is unvoiced (see a
above):
purau-                 flour              pura'u
   (f) Treatment of monosyllables. All monosyllables, except those
ending in -ai-, sustain no loss of mora. They end in free breath or,
if the stem ends in a glottal stop, take on a "" m u r m u r e d "" echo vowel:
pa-      water                           pa·'

rii', rii- I                              ni""f
     A final -ai- in monosyllables   becomes     -a·':
ma(a)i-      to           find           mq·'
    (g) Special developments. A final breathing or voiceless vowel is
lost as such before a word beginning with a voiceless vowel or voice-
less y or w (see 2 below). In such cases the voiceless ending of the
first merges, in a sort of crasis, with the voiceless beginning of the
next. Particularly noteworthy is the formation of voiceless labialized
consonants ""across"" words. Thus, -pi +A'- > -p-A(p·           is here a
strongly aspirated surd); -IJWI + T- > -ywF-; -q-A + WA'- >       -q-WA'-;
-T]WA + W A >      -T)WA'-.  Examples of such mergings are:
tarjWA we + A'pli- to sleep         ta'rjWA'pi'i'   we sleep
-q v objective + w'/'t;m\- to shake ma{-)no'q-w'ito'n'itpiya,aik  wA

taywA we + tVA'tcur/wi- four        taywA'tcü'ywtyum       un i we four
   Not infrequently a final breathing or voiceless vowel is completely
lost before a word beginning with a consonant, particularly if that
consonant is identical or homorganic with the consonant preceeding
the unvoiced vowel. A germinated or nasalized consonant (see § 12,
2, a; § 16) results:
miyo'n iA far away +          pay(a)i-   miyo'n i p aya'ik w'ai' goes off far

U n d e r certain accentual
conditions to be defined below (see § 10, 1) a short v o w e l or the second
mora of a long v o w e l or diphthong loses its voice in initial or medial
position before a geminated unvoiced consonant (p-; t \ q \ qw; s-, c•;
t s, tc).        H e r e w e shall deal only w i t h the manner of such unvoicing.   (a)      Treatment    of short vowels.     Short vowels are unvoiced as in
final position (see 1, a - c ) w i t h the same effect on preceding consonants.
T h e breathy q u a l i t y , h o w e v e r , of these non-final unvoicings is even
greater than in final position.             Hence a m o m e n t of free untimbred
breath (indicated as -'-) is generally audible after the unvoiced v o w e l
proper and before the consonantal                closure; before guttural               stops
(q, qw), less frequently before other stops, this                 develops to a weak
guttural spirant (indicated - 1 -), which has palatal timbre after i
(indicated —-, a v e r y brief but sharp χ sound as in German                            ich).
Such a breath-glide m a y also occur under appropriate                       conditions
finally     before a w o r d closely linked w i t h the preceding; e. g.            pa!ΛΑ1
qari'nA          OF-WATER SITTING ( o b j . ) , OF THE LAKE.          A   nasal (m,        n)
preceding the voiceless v o w e l is completely unvoiced (M, N)                         when
initial and generally half-voiced (MM, TIN) when medial; an initial y
becomes completely unvoiced                (Y- is acoustically like - · - , only in-
clined to be less spirantal in q u a l i t y ) ,        -ni-, when unvoiced, often
appears as n""?, the -i- palatalizing the η (see § 13, 4 ) and unvoicing
to a spirantal -.         As in final position, the vocalic timbre is not always
v e r y clear; e. g. -c-'i- often unvoices to -c -, -ya-           to -χ -, -si- to -s -.

   ( 4 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF PARTICIPLES.    Participles are extremely in
evidence in Paiute. They are employed in a variety of syntactic
ways:
   (a) Attributively, when they may often be translated as relative
clauses or as adjectives.
   (b) Denominatively, e. g. to'ywant'i FIGHTING > FIGHTER, second-
arily HAVASUPAI INDIAN; uvwa-'nt aRi THERE-BEING IT, THE THING
THAT IS THERE.
   (c) Adverbially, particularly with verbalized postpositional forms,
e. g. tümpwi'a-ij 'am-nÜA p\rn'ka ROCK-OBJ.- HE (VIS), IT-AT-BEING-
OBJ. LOOK, i. e. HE LOOKS THERE AT THE ROCK rather than H E SEES THE
ROCK THAT IS THERE.
    (d) Predicatively after verbs, particularly substantive verbs, e. g.
t'itc aro""ami ayan an-i'ntci THIS (INAN.) IS-USITATIVE HOW DOING?
HOW DOES IT WORK? qatcu an ik- %ijwaTjw'ait 'i NOT DOES RAINING
(NEG.), IT DOES NOT RAIN.
   (e) In lieu of finite verbs, particularly after independent personal
pronouns. Such participles may be considered as special cases of
predicative usages (d), the substantive verb being omitted. They
refer to general time as a rule. Examples are:
a'imintim'i say-usitative-participle-plural, (those) wont to say, (they)
   always say
rii' to'ywanii I fighting, I am a fighter
i'mi cii'xaxwai't-uim-inünl    thou squaw-bush-get-go-causative-usita-
    tive-participle-me, you always cause ine to go to get squaw-bush
    twigs
   ( 5 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF ADJECTIVES.      Practically all adjectives are
properly verbal in form. As such, they may be predicatively em-
ployed, like any verb; or, in participial form, attributively or de-
nominatively (e.g. ""'a't 'i tiyo'qwdci     GOOD-BEING RUNNING, GOOD
RUNNER). They may also be employed, in their bare stem-form,
as the first, rarely second, elements of noun compounds (see § 18, 1, d
and e).
   A few adjectives are properly nominal in form, e. g. imaf'p'its·

attributively to refer to an incorporated noun, e. g.:
mia""p 'itsiA wana' Rup'iya' little-obj. net-make-past, made a little net                              § 56. Substantive verbs.
   ( 1 ) FORMATION     OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.      Substantive verbs are
formed from the demonstrative stems a- and u- by means of a verbal-
izing -ro'a-: am'α- το BE (vis.), uru'a- το BE (inv.). These forms may
be used with all nouns, animate or inanimate, and independent
pronouns. These simple forms are also used as the nucleus of a
set of substantive verbs of specific pronominal reference, composed
of the pronouns urjwa- HE, um-'C- THEY, and uru- IT, to which are
respectively appended (not phonetically suffixed) aro'a- for the visible,
uru'a- for the invisible, forms. I t is remarkable that the u- pronouns,
which are properly invisible, should be used in visible substantive
verbs as well, visibility and invisibility being expressed by the a- or u-
of the verb proper. The pronominal substantive verbs thus are:urjw aro'a-   h e is (vis.)                uy uru'a-     h e is (inv.)
umw aro'a- they are (vis.)                 urn uru'a- they are (inv.)
ur aro'a- it is (vis.)                     ur uru'a- it is (inv.)   These may be conveniently written as single words, e. g. uraro'a-
IT is (VIS.). The present tense of substantive verbs is designated
either by the normal -y'i- (§ 32, 1) or, more frequently, by the
absence of a tense suffix. The substantive verb may also take on
other tense suffixes, the modal -νϊ - (§ 33, 2), the usitative suffixes
(§ 30, 10 and 11), the participial -η-, and the nominal abstract
-na-  (§ 25, 3).","[265, 266, 267]"
"                   § 38. Classification of pronouns.
   Paiute pronouns may be divided into six classes: personal pronouns
(in part of demonstrative force); postnominal pronouns (closely
related to personal pronouns but used practically as articles); demon-
strative pronouns (in large part identical with independent third
personal pronouns); interrogative pronouns; relative pronoun; and
reflexive pronouns. All of these occur as independent stems. The
personal pronouns also appear in an enclitic form.
   The independent personal pronouns are either subjective or
objective. The enclitic series, however, makes the distinction only
for the second person and for one or two other forms that will be
specified later. The objective forms include possessive functions.
The classification of pronouns as to person is as follows:
  1st person singular
  1st person dual (inclusive)
  1st person plural (inclusive)
  1st person plural (exclusive)
  2nd person singular
  2nd person plural
  3rd person singular animate visible
  3rd person singular animate invisible
  3rd person plural animate visible
  3rd person plural animate invisible
  3rd person inanimate visible
  3rd person inanimate invisible
   I t will be observed that the only specifically dual form is that of
the 1st person inclusive. Aside from the first person plural inclusive,
all the plural pronominal elements include dual functions; the verb,
however, in the latter case is singular in form (cf. § 31). The in-
animate third person makes no distinction for number; cf. the lack of
plural suffixes for inanimate nouns (§ 48). The classification into
visible and invisible in the third person applies particularly to the
enclitic series. Independent pronouns of the third person are
formed from four distinct demonstrative stems, only one of which
implies invisibility (see § 39).

   (1)   FORMATION OF I N D E P E N D E N T PERSONAL ( A N D DEMONSTRATIVE)
PRONOUNS.     The objectives are formed from the subjectives by the
suffixing of -a- after all vowels but a, after which -ία-, -ya- is sub-

178                                SAPIRstituted. This is precisely as with nouns (§ 49, 1). The first person
singular, however, has a peculiar objective form, riin-ia-, based on an
otherwise non-occurring riin i- instead of rii-. Both subjective and
objective pronouns spirantize following elements (note that -r- be-
comes -tc- after i, -ntc- after nasal + i).
   The first person singular is rii' or mi when used absolutely, rii-
when followed by another element (e. g. postposition or modal
enclitic). The two inclusive pronouns are evidently based on a
common stem ta-, which does not occur uncompounded in Paiute;
but cf. Nahuatl ti WE, to- OUR. The -m-i- of tam-i- is probably identical
with that of mm-wi- WE (EXCLUSIVE) and mw'im-wi- YE; rii-mwi- is
probably based on ηϊ- I. The inclusive plural taijwa- probably goes
back to *tama- (§ 16, 1), perhaps assimilated from *tami- (cf. Hopi
itamö WE); if this is correct, -ywa- is probably ultimately identical
with animate plural -ywl- (§ 48, 1).
   The four sets of third personal and demonstrative pronouns are
based on the demonstrative stems a- THAT (indefinite); ma-, m^a'-
                                   i
THAT (visible or referred to); i-, 'i'- THIS; and Μ-, "" V - THAT (invisible).
The doublets with two moras (m w a'-, ! 'i'-, ""'u'-) do not seem to differ
in meaning from one-moraed forms (ma-, i-, u-); both types are
doubtless found in all animate (singular and plural) and inanimate
subjective and objective forms. The two-moraed forms seem to be
favored when the pronoun is used without suffix, the one-moraed
when used with postpositions. The second element in the third
personal pronouns is pronominal: -ya- for the animate singular; -m-'i-
(sometimes assimilated to -m-u-) for the animate plural (doubtless
identical in origin with animate plural suffix -νι·ϊ- in nouns, § 48, 1);
and -qa- or quasi-pronominal -ri- (-tci-) for the inanimate. In
the inanimate forms the more properly pronominal -q a- series is
far less common than the demonstrative -ri- series; -q a- forms seem
to be in common use in certain other dialects of Southern Paiute.
When used attributively, they follow the noun, while -fi- forms
precede. An enclitic -c-u- (§ 19, 2, k) is very frequently attached to
third personal pronouns, probably to all except inanimates in -q a- and
forms with two-moraed demonstrative stem. The chief character-
istic of -c-u- forms is apparently their more frequent substantive
use as true personal pronouns, other forms being employed with
more clearly demonstrative force, hence often attributively; never-
theless, -c-u- forms are also found used in a demonstrative (and
attributive) sense. In general, it is impossible to draw a hard and

tives, as they are all in structure demonstrative-personals. On the
whole, the purely demonstrative value is strongest in ma- (m w a'-) and
i (''«'-) forms, the personal in a- and u- (""'ω'-) forms.

independent personal pronouns, as of other pronouns and of nouns,
are used as subjects of verbs, unless these are subordinate; as objects
of imperatives (for examples see § 52); and, without -c «-, as bases
for attached postpositions (§ 50, 3). Examples of independent sub-
jective personal pronouns (including pronoun and postposition) are:

rii' pAxqo!Tjurjum""ι mwimwiA  I kill-you (plur.) you (plur. obj.)
  As a rule, however, only one of the pronouns is independent, the

"  (2) DISTRIBUTIVE REDUPLICATION IN NOUNS. Distributive forms
of nouns are quite frequent. They are not true plurals, though
sometimes, particularly in the case of animate nouns, practically
equivalent to such. A distributively conceived noun is practically
always logically plural at the same time, but need not be.

    In the case of stems beginning with w, y, and re there is no possibility of
distinguishing spirantizing and geminating reduplication. Such examples
will be arbitrarily considered as coming under geminating reduplication.
Stems beginning with s, c, generally also m, have geminating reduplication.

verbs indicating the repetition of an action, are reduplicated in a
manner very similar to distributive verbs, though the iterative is
to be considered as a form distinct from the distributive. In some
cases the iterative and the distributive are phonetically identical,
in others there is some difference of form. On the whole, stem
gemination and glottalization tend to be more frequent in iteratives

number of verbs form their momentaneous (or inceptive) form (see
§ 30, 3 - 8 ) by reduplication. Momentaneous reduplication differs
radically from distributive and iterative reduplication in that there
is no accompanying stem gemination or glottalization. There is a
certain amount of overlapping of forms (e. g. tVti'qa- το EAT S E V E R A L
T I M E S ; TO START TO EAT), but, on the whole, reduplicated momentan-
eous forms are sharply distinguished from corresponding reduplicated
distributives and iteratives, e. g. qA'qa'n- το S E T T L E DOWN ( < qafi-

"   (2) MOVABILITY OF GLOTTAL STOP. A puzzling and often dis-
concerting peculiarity of the glottal stop, apart from initial and
final position, is its movability. The phonetic consciousness attaches
it to a certain syllable, but within that syllable it may shift about
with considerable freedom. In part this movability is conditioned
                        X Southern Paiute and Ute
60                                 SAPIRby accentual factors (§ 10, 2), but much of it is purely optional. The
glottal stop may even spill over into the end of or body of the pre-
ceding syllable or into the beginning of the following syllable. Thus,
the syllable -y'ai- το DIE of such a word as tayv'-y'ai-k-a- SEVERAL
ARE THIRSTY may appear with its ' immediately preceding its own
syllable (-'yai-); immediately following its initial consonant {-y'ai-;
it may appear immersed in stops, affricatives, or nasals —see b below);
breaking the first vowel of the diphthong (-ya'ai-; from this type of
glottal affection may develop a glottalized vowel, see a below, e. g.
-yai-); making a hiatus between the two vowels of the diphthong
(-ya'i- or -ya''- with murmured i); closing its syllable {-yai'-); or
glottally affecting the initial consonant of the following syllable
{-yaiha-).   Hence it might be more appropriate to speak of the
glottal affection of a syllable than of a glottal stop. The type y'ai'-
or ya""ai- may be considered the norm.    (a) Broken vowels and diphthongs. Broken vowels are extremely
frequent. They are due to either an inherent glottal stop (e. g.
si'i- το URINATE) or to the secondary operation of an accessory one
(e. g. qani""imi THY HOUSE < qani- HOUSE). Either the first or
second part of the broken vowel may be stressed or relatively stressed;
the unstressed part, particularly if second, tends to be murmured
(o""o > a""a, a'a' >""'a').     The type ""'a' is particularly frequent in
initial position, the type a'"" in final position. A broken diphthong
is one whose first vowel is broken (e. g. a'a'ura', ""'a'ura' TOWARDS IT
<    a- IT +   -Vra'   TOWARDS).
  Examples of vowels and diphthongs broken by an accessory glottal
stop are:
paa'- aunt + -' . . .mi- thy           paa""ami     thy aunt
-p'iyai-   remote past                 qari'plya'aimi   they two sat

   r/wa- his
-q-ai- resultative suffix + -' . . .   p'{ni'ka'aikwA   see it
   qwa- it
   (b) Glottalization of consonants and vowels. A glottalized consonant
may be defined as a welding of the consonant or, more rarely, vowel
with a glottal stop into a composite sound of unified acoustic effect.
Only the stopped consonants, m, n, and rjw form such glottalized
units; in the case of the other consonants, the ' immediately follows
or precedes (e. g. -y'i- or -y'i- < -y'i- present tense + accessory ').
                        Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean    Language
                SOUTHERN        PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN      LANGUAGE              61
A glottalized TO or η is simply a long nasal interrupted for a moment
by glottal closure: m'm, n'n; in glottalized ηιν the ' slips in between
the y and w: y'w. T h e glottalized stops and affricatives (p, (, j ,
(jw, (c, ts) are pronounced with simultaneous oral and glottal closure.
T h e release of the two closures is simultaneous also. This makes
them far more difficult to perceive than the snappy glottalized con-
sonants (""fortes"") of so many other American languages, in which
the glottal release is subsequent to that of the oral closure. Glot-
talized consonants result from either an inherent or accessory
glottal stop; the glottal stop of the glottalized consonant generally
belongs to its own syllable, sometimes to a following syllable, less
often preceding one. Examples are:tca'aifc-ai- to hold + -y'i- present          tca'a'ik ai'yiq wA    holds it
   tense + - ' . . . q uia- it
-qai-    perfective + -n-a- verbal            finiayqiqain'naqfVA      his having
   noun +       . . ,t)wa- his                   told to (him)
wewit-u- to sing a song + -m'mia-,            uvwi'( u'miai'   sings along
   -mi'a-    along
-v'antuywa-     on                            'amu'vm'antuxWA        on them
   T h e movability of the glottal stop is well illustrated in the forms
rii-ci'tcaTjwa'i-%.cf       TEASING A PERSON, citca'y'waiyiaijA      TEASES HIM,
cifca'ywaip     'iya'aimi     FOOLED THEM.
   B y a glottalized vowel, e. g. d, is meant one that is articulated
while continuously interrupted by a rapid series of weak glottal
stops or, probably more correctly, cordal tightenings that approximate
glottal closure. Sometimes the glottalized vowel sounds like a
fairly definitely articulated ""glottal r,"" at other times it seems to
correspond to what German writers on phonetics term ""Pressstimme.""
T h e glottalized vowel may occur as an abbreviated substitute for
the broken vowel or as an anticipatory glottal affection immediately
preceding a more sharply articulated glottal stop, e. g. ρϊηί'^ αίρ ϊά'1'
DID NOT       SEE.
   (c) Over-glottalization. W h a t is morphologically a single glottal
stop often manifests itself twice or even three times in the course of
a word. Several examples have already illustrated this. Further
examples are:
cu(w)a- nearly + -y'ai- to die                cu(w)a'(i)'y'aip'Cya'    nearly died
uvwa - there Η—yu- post-position              uvv'd-""(i)y'umL    there they
   + -' . . .mi- they

  -xwa'ai-    to go in order to                build a house
   The over-glottalization, though rarely, may even manifest itself
in the immediately preceding word; e. g. qa'ni u'a'xarux-WA RIGHT
THROUGH THE HOUSE (properly qama-, obj.); similarly qa'ni           aura'
HOUSE TOWARDS IT < qani' a'u'ra\         the glottal stop separating a
and u being here so faint that it escaped perception, while the intrusive
' of qa'ni was distinctly audible.
   In such an example as -r'oarfa' ami HE—THEE? the ' after η is
intrusive, caught, as it were, between the ' of interrogative -r'o- and
the ' of -αηα'α-, broken, by -' . . .mi- THEE, from -αηα- HE.
  (d) Contraction.  On the other hand, two organically distinct
glottal stops may, though far less frequently, merge into a single
one; e. g.:
-pa'na- on +       . . .mi- they             tümpwi'pa'nam'i   on a stone they

   The Paiute relative pronoun, pi-, can be used only with post-
positions; e. g. pima- WITH WHICH, pu'urai- WHERETO, WHITHER,
pivwa- IN WHICH, WHERE. The equivalent of our own subjective and
objective relative clauses is afforded by participles and verbal nouns
in -na- (§ 25, 3). Properly speaking, pi- is a noun, as is shown by
the fact that it is frequently followed by an inanimate article-pronoun.
The verb following the relative is generally in the form of a verbal
noun in -n a-, less frequently in the form of a participle in -p i- (§
25, 5, b), rarely a non-participial absolute; hence the logical subject
of a relative clause is always objective (i. e. possessive) in form. A
sentence like THIS IS THE STICK THAT I HIT HIM WITH is rendered by
THIS IS THE STICK WITH WHICH (IS) MY HITTING (OR HAVING HIT) HIM.
Examples of relative clauses are;
itci'a q-A n'fni p'ivwa' qari'n ani this (inan. obj.)-it (vis.) me which-in
   sitting-my, this is where I stay

"                     § 30. Suffixes of verbal aspect.
   By ""aspect,"" a term borrowed from Slavic grammar, is here meant
the temporal range of the action, i. e. its definition with respect to
such concepts as momentaneousness, durativeness, inception, itera-
tion. These and like concepts have no primary connection with
the concept of relative time, which is the province of the temporal
suffixes (§ 32).
              Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean    Language
           SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                       149   Among the ideas expressed by aspect suffixes, those of momen-
taneousness and durativeness are the most important. Every verb
has a durative and a momentaneous form, the former being generally
the primary form of the verb, the latter expressed by internal con-
sonant gemination, glottalization, reduplication, the suffixing of
certain elements, or a combination of these. The durative, as its
name implies, expresses continuous action, action conceived of as
lasting for an appreciable length of time (e. g. ΤΟ DRINK) ; the momen-
taneous conceives of the action as taking but a moment of time (e. g.
ΤΟ TAKE A DRINK) . Following are a few preliminary examples of the
distinction:
       DURATIVE                             MOMENTANEOUS
qova'qwi- to break                     qo'po'qwi-
naya'va- to seem                     naya!p a -yu-
mantcu'ywi-na-   to crush            rnantcu'q wi-n'na-
yaya'- to cry                        yaya'ya-     to burst into tears
im!- to drink                         im'-jju-
qwatea'-ya- to splash about          qwA'tca'-q i- to splash (once)
iiyai- to take place                  tTqa'rj'wi-
nontsi'- to            fly            nontsi'-k-u-
  The various methods of forming the momentaneous exemplified
above are to be considered as more or less equivalent. No simple
rules can be given for all cases. One simply has to learn, e. g., that
such a form as *yaya'quplya* is not in use, but that yaya'xAp'iya
must be employed.
  The aspects that may be recognized in Paiute are the durative,
the momentaneous, the inceptive, the iterative, the durative-iterative,
the resultative, the usitative, and the continuative. Moreover,
ideas that belong to the category of aspect are sometimes expressed
by means of compounded verb-stems or suffixes of motion (e. g. the
cessative by -maupa-, § 18, 2, a; the continuative or durative by
-qar'i- ΤΟ SIT, -q wa'ai- ΤΟ GO OFF, § 28, 2). A careful study of the
nuances of aspect formation can hardly be given here. We shall
simply list the various aspect suffixes with examples. For momentan-
eous (and inceptive) verbs formed by gemination or glottalization,
see § 53, 2; by reduplication, § 58, 5. For iteratives formed by re-
duplication, with or without accompanying gemination, glottalization,
or both, see § 58, 4.
  (1) -ya-g durative of active intransitive (mediopassive) verbs.
By a mediopassive verb is meant one that expresses action without

150                                SAPIRdefinite agency, e. g. τ ο SHAKE (intr.), as contrasted with transitive
τ ο SHAKE and passive τ ο BE SHAKEN. Sometimes -ya- seems to be
used also with agentive active verbs. Examples of durative -ya- are:
riintci'yai  (it) shakes
piyo'xwai' (he) drags (it);     piyo'x Aqip'iya'aiywA      he came home
   dragging (it)
yiu'xwai'   moves around
yu'mu'x(w)Ap'iya'       (he) moved
qwimpu'xwai'      (it) wiggles
si'yu'xwai'   slides  T h e momentaneous correlate of -ya- is -qi- (see 3 below).
  T h e element -ya-g is very commonly employed in durative verbs
expressing a continuous sound of some sort, e. g.:
ampa'ya-       to talk
po 'yux Apiyain i there was a sound as of something going through
    (his) flesh (for -n ia- in these and other -ya- verbs, see § 19, 2, d).
fiijwa'vaya- to make a noise
ki 'yuxwa(i)yin i makes a noise like rattling coins
pa 'raxa(i)ym i (rain) patters
qu'pa'raxa-       to pop in burning
po 'n'noxwa{i)yin i sounds like drumming
no 'ruxwa{i)yin-C       sounds like a heavy object being dragged on a
    smooth level surface
                       •pi'T)kixa(i)ytn i sounds like dripping water
si·' yaxani'iylni      makes a rustling noise (for -n i'i-, see 12 below)  T h e momentaneous correlate of this -ya- also is -q i- (or -rjqi-).   (2) -γΐ-, (-ijqi-) durative-iterative, chiefly of active intransitive,
sometimes transitive, verbs. I t is often transitivized by means of
-yfi- (§ 29, 10). I t differs from -ya- in conceiving of the action as not
strictly continuous, but broken up into a rapid series. I t differs from
the normal iterative (expressed by reduplication) in t h a t the repeated
acts cohere into a single durative unit. Examples are:tarfwi'tciyc   keeps time by tapping with (his) foot
mavi'tSLji    claps hands
qinip uxwC ' (mouse) gnaws
ίΑ'ρϊ'η'αηα'χιηφί'    stamps (on the ground to make it smooth)

ovwo'qway(c)i'        (it) bounces up and down (like a rubber ball)
tuvwa'yaitcai-     several pull out (intr.), emerge
 Sound-verbs indicating a continuous series of sounds of like nature
may also have the -yi- suffix, e. g.:
quypa'ra       x(t)ik  a- several pop (one after another)
w'ini'ruxwL-         to make a noise on the rasp
wa'a'uxwi           barks
w'a'tciyiijupiya'           (he) w h o o p e d   A few such verbs have -ΐ)φ- instead of -yi-, e. g.:
pu'qwi'airjqiyin-L             (he) pants
puy'wi'rjqii'           (mouse, rat) makes a peeping noise
ki{y)i'r}qiV            laughs
   (3) - q i - momentaneous, chiefly of active intransitive and medio-
passive verbs. Transitive forms in -q i-ηφ-.     Morphologically, -qi-
is the regular momentaneous correspondent of -yi-, formed from it by
gemination (§ 53, 2 b); it contrasts with both -ya- and -yi- forms.
Examples of its use are:
tA'pi'tcAqiTjqi'qwA          to crush it by stepping on (it)
mina'qi          (one thing) break(s) off
tarii'ntciqii]qip'iyai{y)aq     A (he) shook it by trampling once with (his)
    feet
mava't A'qirjqi to burst by means of the hand
lAxqi'lfIqwirjqip'iyaiAxqa      ' mI they hit it so as to have (it) go to pieces

to'pa'q i      (one object) come(s) loose
si'yu'q    wi     to slide, slip
   Midway between properly momentaneous forms in -qi- and
durative forms in -ya- or -yi- are certain verbs in -q i- with non-
momentaneous form of stem, i. e. with ungeminated consonant.
These may be termed durative-momentaneous. Examples of dura-
tive-momentaneous versus momentaneous forms are:
qovo'q-WL- to break (intr.): qo'po'q wi- to break instantaneously
paya'q (a)i- to tear slowly (but in one tear): pA'qa'q i- to tear
                          X Southern Paiute and Ute
152                                 SAPIR  In such verbs -q-i- does not seem to alternate with -ya- and -yi-.
  Verbs indicating a momentaneous sound also have a -q-i- suffix, e. g.:
kiffca'q in i   (it) makes a sound as of when something is thrust
   through paper
sa'mu'qwiyini       makes a deep noise as when a stone is thrown into a
   well
qi 'k in-L (it) sounds like one tear of a rag
v'cu'q-WL whistles
   (4) -n a- durative transitive with singular object: -n'na- momen-
taneous transitive with singular object. See § 31, 2, b and c.   (5) -yu- n momentaneous. This is by far the most common mo-
mentaneous suffix. It follows most verb stems and is also employed
after many derivative and verbalizing suffixes. Examples are:
im- to drink                           ivi'yu to take a drink
maain-i- to touch (duratively)         maa'in-irju      to touch (for a
                                          moment)
qvni- to take (one object)             qwii'yu to pick up (one object)

significance, but its true force is never intrinsically inceptive or
cessative. Examples of these developments of the primary moment-
aneous idea are:

  These examples show that -i)u-n in the present (-yi-) may indicate a
momentaneous (or inceptive) activity that is just about to take
place (cf. the use of momentaneous forms in Russian to indicate the
future). The idea of imminent activity is still more explicitly
rendered by -quntsi-, compounded of -tju-n and diminutive -(ri)tsi-
(§ 35, 2). Thus, a form like trqa'quntsi- EAT-MOMENTANEOUS (IN-
CEPTIVE)-LITTLE,      TO B E   A LITTLE    OFF FROM BEGINNING TO         EAT,
easily comes to mean το BE ABOUT TO EAT. Examples of pre-inceptive
-r/untsi- are:qu'qwiyuntsilf oeni I am ready to shoot (for -ka- see § 32, 2)
ya'uqwirjunUik-A     (the sun) is about to set
A'pi'iTfunts komi I am about to fall asleep, I am sleepy  (6) -ij'wi- momentaneous (intransitive). This suffix, which may
be related to -yu-n, occurs only in two or three verbs, its durative
correlative being a rarely occurring -i- or, in one case, -q a-. These
verbs are:
         DURATIVE                                 MOMENTANEOUS
ttyai- to take place                      t'i'qaij'wi-
piyai-  to be left over                     piyay'wi-
cuwaqa-    to breathe                     cuwarfwi-      to take a long breath
    (7) -qu-, -ju-    momentaneous; inceptive. This element, like
-τμι-η, seems to be primarily momentaneous in significance and in a
number of verbs is used instead of -iju-"". Some verbs have both
-iju-"" and -q u- forms, generally with some idiomatic difference of
meaning. In many cases, moreover, -q u- is a properly inceptive
element, as in durative-inceptive -ya-q u-. What nuance of meaning
differentiates -q u- and -q u- is not clear. Presumably -q u- is more
definitely momentaneous in character (see § 53, 2, a, 3); as inceptive
it probably indicates a sharp moment of beginning.
   Examples of momentaneous -q u- are:
pA'qa-     to beat, kill                  pA'qa'qu-   to give a licking:
                                            pAxqa'yu-   to kill
wt'i-    to fall                          wV'i'q u- to drop down, fall out

"   The text material presented in this paper belongs to two rather
 distinct, though closely related, dialects of the Ute-Chemehuevi
 branch of Plateau Shoshonean. The bulk of the paper is devoted
 to mythological and other texts obtained in 1910 (February to May)
from Tony Tillohash, a young Kaibab Paiute from Kanab, in south-
western Utah; the balance, to mythological texts and one tale recorded
in English, secured in 1909 (August and September) from Charlie
Mack, a Uintah Ute from White Rocks, Utah.
   The Ute texts were obtained at White Rocks in the course of a
brief trip among the Utes of Uncompahgre and Uintah reserves.
A further series of thirty Ute tales was obtained in English by my
colleague, Dr. J. A. Mason; these were published under the title of
"" Myths of the Uintah Utes"" in The Journal of American Folk-Lore
for July-September, 1910 (pp. 299-363). I should not fail to add
that Dr. Mason also obtained a series of interesting pictographs in
the course of a reconnaissance of Nine Mile Canyon, some distance
south of Uintah Reservation. This material is still unpublished.
   More substantial for linguistics than the Ute work were the results
obtained from Tony, who was in 1910 just about to complete his
course at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Through the
kindness of Dr. G. B. Gordon, the director of the University of
Pennsylvania Museum, and of the superintendent of the Indian
School, arrangements were made to have Tony housed in Phila-
delphia and employed at the Museum, so that he might be ren-
dered available as a source of information for further Shoshonean
researches. Tony proved an excellent informant. Though young
and absent from his native home for about five years, he was of a
naturally conservative temperament and possessed of a remarkable
memory. Hence he was better informed on the subject of tribal
lore than could normally have been expected. His unfailing good
humor and patience also helped materially to lighten a task that
demanded unusual concentration. (Indeed, in all my linguistic
experience, I doubt if phonetic perception has ever been so severely
taxed as in recording Shoshonean dialects of the Ute-Chemehuevi
group.) Besides the Kaibab Paiute texts here presented, there were
                         X Southern Paiute and Ute

secured from Tony supplementary material for the grammatical and
lexical study of his language; a series of over two hundred songs,
chiefly ceremonial, recorded in text and on the phonograph; and a
considerable body of ethnological information. The grammatical
data have been worked up into a sketch of the Paiute language,
which forms the first part of this volume. The lexical material fol-
lows in the third part. The songs and the ethnological data will
form the subjects of future papers. Tony, further, proved valuable
as a first-hand source for a seminar in American Indian linguistics
that I was then giving at the University of Pennsylvania. Last, but
not least, he was a delightful companion at all times and is remem-
bered with the friendliest feelings by all who came in contact with
him in Philadelphia.
   The linguistic relation of Southern Paiute (to be carefjlly dis-
tinguished from Northern Paiute or ""Paviotso"") to Uintah Ute is
close. Indeed, they are not so much closely related languages as
mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. This probably
applies to all the dialects of Ute-Chemehuevi, which may be defined
as a dialectically differentiated Shoshonean language stretching from
Uncompahgre Ute in central Colorado to Chemehuevi in southeastern
 California. The texts embodied in the present volume are therefore
illustrative of one of the most widespread languages of aboriginal
 America, though the specific dialects of the texts, Kaibab Paiute and
Uintah Ute, cover only restricted territories in southwestern Utah
and northwestern Arizona and in northeastern Utah respectively.
No attempt has been made to normalize the texts, which are given
here precisely as heard. The phonetic system used is that described
 in the report of the Phonetic Committee of the American Anthro-
pological Association ; l the symbols are defined in the key prefixed to
 the texts. Those wishing to make an analytical study of the language
 are referred to the Paiute grammar which precedes; the necessary
 lexical assistance is given by the Paiute dictionary which follows.
    In their mythological affiliations the tales recorded here evidently
 correspond closely to the Ute, Shoshone, and Comanche tales already
 published by Kroeber, Mason, Lowie, and St. Clair. References to
 parallel tales have been confined to Plateau Shoshonean. Further
 parallels from other Plateau tribes, from Plains tribes to the east,
 and from California and Washington-Oregon tribes to the west are  1

given in the papers mentioned. On the whole, the relation of Southern
Paiute mythology to that of the Northern Shoshone is very close,
perhaps even closer than might have been expected.
   In conclusion, I should like to express my indebtedness to the
late Dr. Gordon's kind help which was given me throughout the
prosecution of my Shoshonean studies.

      ε open as in English met.
      i close as in French fini.
       ! open as in English it.
      ο close as in au of French chapeau.
      ο open as in German voll, but less clearly rounded,

      u open as in English pull, sporadically close as in English
            rule; always close when long (u ).
      u· long and open as in English poor, but without r-glide.
      I high-back-unrounded-narrow (Sweet's terminology); may be
            produced by completely unrounding close u, without
           modifying tongue position of u. On first acquaintance
           this vowel impresses one as a "" m u d d i e d "" nuance of ü,
           but its formation is quite unlike that of French or Ger-
           man ü. Its semivocalic form is γ (see below), to which
           it is related as u to w or i to v. ϊ, ii, and i are modified
            forms of ϊ.
      t high (or high to mid)-back-unrounded-wide; related to ϊ
           approximately as t to i or ε to e. I t is apt to sound like
           a "" m u d d i e d "" ö or a dull a.
      ü not a true ü as in French or German, but duller in timbre.
           Probably high-niixed-rounded-wide; apt to sound like a
           rapid diphthongal i u .
      i high-mixed-rounded-wide; approximately like i of English
           (American) first, but without r-quality.
      ö as in German schön or Götz (i. e. close or open in quality).
           Rare in Paiute, but very common in Ute, where it corres-
           ponds to Paiute o.

  •   and other superior vowels:
          weakly articulated, but not completely unvoiced, vowels.
          They are frequently glides, sometimes they are reduced
          from fully articulated vowels. After their own vowel,
          generally long, e. g. a "", they denote'' pseudo-diphthongal""
          rearticulation. Before and after glottal stops (') they
          are murmured in Paiute, after glottal stops they are
          whispered in Ute.
  A and other small-cap vowels:
          completely unvoiced vowels, pronounced with full
          breath. They may be defined as voiceless breath
          modified by various vocalic timbres.
  q and other vowels with subscript hook:
          nasalized vowels; nasalization is either weakening of η
          (see below) or secondary, due to presence of preceding or
          following nasal consonant. \y, nasalized w, occurs
          sporadically in Ute as development of i}.
        1
  i,        weakly articulated, but not completely unvoiced, nasal-
          ized vowels.
  k and other vowels with superscript ' :
          glottalized vowels, i. e. vowels interrupted by a series of
          weak glottal stops. This type of articulation is some-
          times referred to as "" glottal r . "" w, glottalized w, occurs
          sporadically as development of u'. ä is secondarily
          developed from a' or 'a; similarly for other vowels.
  TJ, '{ unvoiced forms of >4, j; may be defined as voiceless
          nasalized breath with u and ϊ timbre respectively. This
          type of articulation is rare.
Diphthongs.
  ai, äi, äi, εϊ, oi, oi, ui pronounced as diphthongal combinations
         of a, ä, ä, s, ο, ο, and u respectively with following i.
         These diphthongs are either inorganic, i arising as glide
         before following y, or organic, in which case the first
         vowel is sometimes heard doubled, e. g. aai, ooi. In
         certain cases the two vowels are pronounced with a drag,
         indicated as a.i; in others, the i is rather faint, indicated
         as a'.
  a'l diphthongal combination of a and ϊ.
  au diphthongal combination of a and u (cf. ou of English
         gout), aau, a.u, and a u are also found.

"   (2) R E D U C T I O N OF FINAL LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS. A final
long vowel or a diphthong loses its second mora before a word be-
ginning with a vowel, i. e. the long vowel is shortened, while the
second vowel of the diphthong is lost without trace:
-va- a t                                 maw! %niiyuis· there then

                                            -qwa see § 14, 3, c)
   A final short vowel, reduced as above, may combine into a long
with the vowel of like quality that begins the following word; e.g.
tspi'rjuqwa y'a'V' antux • wA.
   ( 3 ) R E T E N T I O N OF FINAL VOWELS. The above rules do not apply
to monosyllables, which retain their second mora:
pa - water                               pa·' am the water
o·- arrow                                o·' am the arrow
qwau- off, away                          qwau ayi'm aywit ux w A off away
                                            from it
  Before ai-, *ai- ΤΟ SAY subjective independent personal pronouns
keep theil· final vowel. There is probably some morphological
reason back of this usage. Examples are:
imi- thou                                imi' 'aik-A thou sayest
riirri""i- we (exclus.)                   ta 'ampiniyai]W nynai' 'a'ik ami

                                            you (pi.) say
  The same rule applies to subjective independent personal pronouns
before an i'-k-a- τ ο DO, except t h a t third personal pronouns (at least
animate singulars) lose their final vowel and insert a glottal stop
before the verb (cf. enclitic -aya'ya- < -arja- + -aya-, § 41, 1, e):
                             X Southern Paiute and Ute

but:
mwaija-       t h a t one (animate)           mwa'r/ 'ani'k-A    t h a t one does
  Apparently other final vowels are sometimes preserved before
ani-fca-:
qatcu-       not                              qatcu ani'k-A
   Certain final vowels are protected from elision by taking on a
glottal stop. This is true of nominal or independent pronominal
subjects immediately followed by a substantive verb (see § 56),
e. g.:
itci- this                                    itci"" 'aru""am i this is wont to be
na'a'intsii si-      little girl              na'a'ints tsi' aru""a a little girl it is
imi- thou                                     imi"" y,waru""a     thou art
     With the last example contrast:
imia-        (of) thee                        imi   'uraru""a    it is thine
  I t is likely t h a t here again we are not dealing with a purely phonetic
phenomenon.
  A protecting glottal stop is added also to the final α of the preterit
enclitics -ywa- and -(n)tca- (see § 19), provided they are directly
preceded by an independent personal pronoun and followed by a
word beginning with a consonant, e.g.:

  Under this term are included a considerable number of elements
of prevailingly instrumental significance. They are used chiefly
with verb forms, but not exclusively. In nouns they may in part
be employed non-instrumentally, nor is the properly instrumental
function always apparent in verb forms. Their origin is largely ob-
scure, b u t certain analogies suggest strongly t h a t they are on the
whole specialized forms of incorporated nouns with instrumental
function (see § 18, 2, f, a ) ; to some extent they may be related to
verb stems.

    (1) ma-' {man- before tc, ts) HAND. This prefix is clearly related
to, but not directly derived from, independent ma'o-' HAND. I t is
found in one form or other in all Uto-Aztekan dialects (e. g. T ü b a t u -
labal independent ma-; Fernandino, Luisefio -ma; Tarahumare,
Pima ma-; Nahuatl ma- in compounds and as instrumental prefix).
I t is very common as instrumental verb prefix, many verbs not
occurring without it. Its great age is indicated by the presence of
verbs in ma-yw-, spirantized from ma-rn-. Instrumental (in part
apparently objective) examples of verb forms are:man'tcAxqirjqi to crush with one's hand
mayu'x-i}$(£ to point a t
mavi'tsiyi   claps (his) hands
maya 'i* tests by feeling
mayu'tcu'C feels around, picks a t (ear, tooth, arm-pit)

mar'iyqa- to create
mayari- to protect
ma(i)yu'n-aq-ai(y)ayA     to have arms around his neck
maxo'p in'NA to break (trans.)

prefixes (e. g. ma-, ta-°, tsi-°). Its precise force, however, is far
from clear. Perhaps it denotes indefinite instrumentality. In some
cases it seems to refer, like νια-, to the HAND. Examples are:
tcA'pa'niui' shakes (with the hand) (cf. tAKpa'ntu- to shake with the

u^pu'q wi- to bounce (like a ball) (cf. tA'pu'q-wi- to jump).
  This element is not a true instrumental, but rather a stereotyped
objective classifier. I t may, indeed, be used with true instrumental
prefixes, e. g. mao'p-Axqayqi- ΤΟ MAKE A HOLE BY STICKING ONE'S
HAND INTO.

possibly contain this element (ROUND OPENING metaphorically >

prefix because it occurs in a number of verbs whose bare stems are
not found in use without it:
patca'qwa-    to get wet, patca'qwi- to be wet
pan'yi-   to wash (trans.), nava'riyi- to wash oneself
patca1qiijwa- to water, irrigate
   Less probably also:
nava'q'i-     to bathe (intrans.) (non-reflexive -paq'i- not found)
   The instrumental prefixes are much more closely connected with
the verb stem proper than any other elements preceding the stem,
e. g. adverbial prefixes, reflexive na- (see § 22, 1), or incorporated
nouns. An instrumental prefix comes nearest the stem. Owing to
this close connection, the psychological analysis becomes somewhat
obscured at times, so that the notion of instrumentality may be
repeated in a preceding incorporated noun, e. g. wii'-ywTpaq m'NA
τ ο RIP OPEN WITH A KNIFE (contains both instrumental incorporated
noun wii- KNIFE and instrumental prefix -tjw'i- < -ινϊ- WITH THE
BLADE OF A LONG OBJECT). Sometimes an instrumental prefix is
so closely identified with the stem that it may be preceded by another
instrumental prefix, e. g. MAlpi'k i- τ ο TOUCH (that ma-' is a prefix
is indicated by parallel tA'pi'ki- τ ο TOUCH WITH THE FOOT) : wima'-

Bear Danceu4   In 1901 they had a bear-dance in the afternoon (5 to 6) about that time,
not as an important dance, but as a pleasure dance, just as they had foot
and horse races, wrestling, target-shooting. There is no particular leader
to a bear dance. About eight men sit down on the ground in a circle around
a dishpan (formerly a round basket) and play rasps which lie on the pan
nearly flat (only tilted to a slight angle), singing at the same time. The
singing starts in first as a sort of signal for the beginning of the dance.
Whoever wishes joins in; others may look on. The women gather on the
side away from the singers; the men are near the singers. The girls and
women advance towards the singers on the flat stomped-out dancing
ground in no regular line, and without keeping time to the music; then
each singles out a partner from the men by touching with a branch or
throwing a pebble. The woman then advances backwards followed at a
distance by the man she had picked out in time to the music; they may
thus advance and come back several times before joining in together. The
dancing parties do not keep in line, but each advances and steps back
regardless of the others. After a while (or immediately), they join, each
holding the right hand on the other's left shoulder and left hand behind
the waist. There seems to be no attempt to have the step (a sort of light
springy walk or semi-hop) keep in time to the singing and rasping; some
go fast, others slow. A song generally lasts from five to ten minutes. After
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic   Field Notes           849a very short interval, the next is started; other parties now dance or the
same may dance again. The girls are supposed to represent the bears, the
men are the persons who dance with the bear women, according to the
myth. If one does not wish to follow the girl he is poked with a pole or
branch carried by one of the two or three officers (who may have appointed
themselves so or been agreed upon as such by the men, not the women)
and forced to follow. If one is not alert in following, it is believed that
when chased by a bear in the mountains, he will not get away easily;
otherwise he would. Many songs are sung. The last song is the longest,
lasting from about twenty to thirty minutes, and is called ""moving the
longest distance"" (miyotox mi4i')· If one of the members of a party gives
out, his or her place is taken immediately by a friend, a large number of
whom are ready. Both boy (man) and girl (woman) must not stop dancing
at the same time; the party as such must continue throughout. It generally
ends about sundown.
   When Tony was about eight or nine, the Kaibabs returned from hunting
on the Kaibab Plateau to Kanab in the fall and were instructed in it by
Tom (then a young man of Cedar City Indians, who had been much with
the Utes; he now lives with the Kaibabs and is considered the best singer
of bear-dance songs, being generally the song-leader) and medicine-man
Mamputs of the Arizona Paiutes, who had traveled much among the
Southern Utes. Tom ordered six holes to be dug in a distance of about 20
feet and had cedar posts (about 10 feet high) erected; no explanation was
given of this fence and it has never been used since. Mamputs sang first
as leader, chiefly songs with words; then Tom followed, mostly with songs
without words, which are considered more difficult. One of his songs long
after, maybe composed by himself, is: ""Let us go back home, my friend,
we are traveling about just for fun."" Nowadays the bear dance is generally
sung in March, but sometimes also during the summer, whenever there is
a general gathering or ""good time.""
   The Bear Dance takes place every spring, generally early in March. Two
lines are formed, one of men and one of women; the dance consists in the
moving of the two lines towards each other, stopping, then moving back,
and so on repeatedly. Six or eight men are used as singers of the Bear
Dance songs. These songs have Paiute words and seem to follow in a
certain order, each song consisting of a statement or of a question and
answer referring to some incident in the myth recounting the origin of the
Bear Dance. There must be several hundred of these songs; according to
Tony Tillohash, old men acquainted with all the songs would be able to
sing from nightfall to morning without duplicating songs. The singers in
850                       X Southern   Paiute and   Ute
the dance accompany themselves with rasps, rubbing cylindrical pieces of
wood over long, somewhat oblong sticks serrated on one side with angular
notches. Different sized rasps could be used. To secure a sounding board,
a small pit is dug in the ground and a basket placed over it. The rasps rest
on this by an edge obliquely cut away at one end of the side opposite the
notches. The ceremony lasts four days.
   In the Bear Dance, three officers are appointed with long pointed
sticks. If a man touched by a willow branch held by a girl refuses to
dance, he will not escape when chased by a grizzly bear. The dance is
supposed to give a person the power to escape from bears. The dance
consists in running back and forth, man with woman partner.
   In the Bear Dance a man and woman faced each other with one hand
on the other's shoulder and the other hands clasped.145 The pair ran up
and down keeping together in this position.
   The Bear Dance is important enough in itself to make different bands
come around to witness; generally it is held at the place where a
particular band camps. The Kaibabs have it every March when bears
come out of their dens; also the Arizona Paiutes have it; the Muddies
and St. Georges have seen it but do not perform it, not having good
bear-dance singers.146
Rasps Used in the Bear Dance   Mampüts generally rasps one direction, towards himself, two beats
to each bar. Tom generally rasps four times to a bar, alternately towards
and away from himself, the main beat coming on the rasp beat towards
himself, with which he begins.
   Before beginning to sing, it is customary to have one bar of rasping
(two ""towards"" beats with M., four beats with Tom); sometimes only
a bar is rasped. At the end of a song the rasp is played with four (or
five) rapid (twice as quick as before) strokes, the last being outward
and most accented. Raspers may follow either of two styles; they do
not all have to rasp in the same way.  uvwu tivun'     qamusaywÄyätsiYv Ant""

"                          § 47. Noun and verb stem.
  All Paiute stems end in a vowel or diphthong. A peculiarity of the
great majority of noun and verb stems is that they are primarily
disyllabic, e. g. qan iHOUSE;   fivwi-a EARTH; αΙ α-° SAND; ραγ(«){-"" τ ο
GO; qari-"" ΤΟ SIT; paq a-° ΤΟ KILL. The typical monosyllabic stem (or
radical) of so many languages is conspicuous by its comparative
infrequency; moreover, practically all monosyllabic stems have two
moras, e. g. qa -' ΤΟ SING, pai-"" ΤΟ CALL to -"" BLACK, O - S ARROW, pen-""
BLOOD. If expressed in terms of moras, the typical Paiute stem
would probably be found to have two moras, i. e. to consist of a
monosyllable with a long vowel or diphthong, or, far more frequently,
of two short-voweled syllables. However, disyllabic stems of three
moras (e. g. tu-γυ•- ΤΟ CACHE, Una - BOTTOM) are not at all rare.
Trisyllabic stems, of three or more moras (e. g. as ia - SURFACE,
tayoq wi- ΤΟ RUN), are also fairly common; stems of four or more
                Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean      Language
            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                      213syllables are rare (e. g. ttvwitsiya- ΤΟ OBEY). Were extended com-
parative Uto-Aztekan material available, it would no doubt be
possible to show that many of these trisyllabic and tetrasyllable
stems are capable of analysis. The two-moraed stem ending in a
vowel, of both monosyllabic and disyllabic structure, is clearly the
characteristic type of stem for all Uto-Aztekan languages.
   Noun and verb stems are kept clearly distinct, the use of the same
stem now as noun, now as verb, being exceedingly uncommon. An
example is quq wa- WOOD, also ΤΟ GATHER WOOD (cf. English BERRY
and ΤΟ BERRY); note also ni(y)a- (two-moraed) ΤΟ CALL BY NAME,
but ni{y)a•- (three-moraed) NAME (it is quite possible, however, that
niya- really consists of niya- + possessive -α-, § 24, 2, a so t h a t niya-
would be another example of a stem capable of being used either as
noun or verb).
   From a strictly formal standpoint, noun and verb are, as we have
seen, carefully distinguished, there being very few grammatical
elements which are appended to both types of stem (e. g. diminutive
-tsi-, § 35; plural -q a-, § 31, 1, c and § 48, 2). However, there is a
slight tendency for verbs to be nominalized, without nominalizing
suffix, by means of nominal postpositions, but forms of this sort are
far from common (e. g. p'ivwa wim'jf aip a ntux wA WHICH-IN STAND-
PERFECTIVE-TO, TO WHERE ( H E ) HAD STOOD) ; see § 55,2. The clearest
syntactic indication of a feeling for nominal form is the presence of
article-pronouns (§42).","[230, 231]"

                     § 22.   Reflexive and reciprocal prefixes.
   (1) na-' SELF, EACH OTHER (nan- before tc, ts). Properly speaking,
forms in na-' are nothing but compounds of reflexive pronominal
stem na- (for independent na- with postpositions, see § 46) and verb-
stem or noun-stem (for type of compound see § 18, 2, c; 1, i).
The element na- is so frequently and idiomatically used, however,
that it seems advisable to treat it as a prefix.
   Its primary significance is reflexive, e. g.:
ρϊη ί-      to see                         nav'i'niiuik ai(y)arjani he let me
                                             see himself
mjwai- to hang                             nq^waip tya' hung (him)self
a-ija-ru- to make a pinon jay              na'a '""7)aRUqwq,umpa' shall turn
                                              (them)selves into pifion jays

                   Southern    Paiute, a Shoshonean     Language
                SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN            LANGUAGE              109   Many verbs in na- have an indirect reflexive or mediopassive signi-
ficance. Not infrequently the stem is not in use without the prefixed
na-, Examples are:-qa- (stem not used alone)                  naya-     to wear (clothing)
-to 'a- (stem not used alone)               naro 'a-r/u- to have (one's skin)
                                              on
-paq-ϊ- to bathe (bare stem not             nava' q-'ip'iya'   bathed (them)-
   in use)                                    selves
-qut ei'a- (for qu-° see § 21, 12)          nayu'tci'a- to burn up (intrans.)   A very common derivative of the primary idea of na- is that
of reciprocity, generally of the subject, less often of the object,
e. g.quq wi-       to shoot                      nayu'q wiijqi- to shoot at each
                                               other, i. e. to fight

maya-       to give                         naywa'xarjqi-      self-give-to, i. e.
                                               to pay

                                               each other

                                               another
-tsm'na-       (stem not used alone)        nantsm'na- to joint, cause to be
                                               joined together   Reduplicated nana-, to express either iteration or distribution of
reflexive-reciprocal activity (see § 58, 3 and 4), is common, e. g.:na-ro·'q wa-      to stretch oneself        nana'ro q wai'    stretches (him)-
                                              self several times

                                              ing one by one   It is frequently employed where emphasis on reciprocity, as distinct
from reflexive activity, is desired, even when not more than two
actors are involved, e. g.:
                           X Southern Paiute and Ute
110                                    SAPIRw'inai-     to throw down                  nana' rjw^nairjqiy'iarjani I throw-

  oneself                                    give it to each other
  The idea of reciprocity leads naturally to t h a t of duality of terms
involving mutual relationship, e. g.:
pavi- elder brother                        ηανα'νιψυϊ       two brothers

                                             and daughter (or son)

pai- three                                 navai- 2 χ 3, i. e. six
   Plurals of such dual reciprocals are formed by reduplicating no- to
nana-, e. g. nan-a'vawjw'i (three or more) BROTHERS; nana'-rj'watsi-
rjwi FATHER AND SONS; nana!nyivw'iyw'i     (three or more) FRIENDS.

         M a n y Southern Pauite m y t h s are characterized by the use of ""song
recitatives,"" t h a t is, set melodies to the tune of which the characters of t h e
myth recite their speeches. Not all myths, however, have such recitatives.
Thus, the story of "" C o y o t e and Porcupine"" (pp. 456-462) was explicitly stated
by Tony to be told without recitatives. This m a y be suggestive of borrowing
from the Utes, with whom this story is a favorite and who, so far as known,
use no song recitatives in their m y t h s ; the mention of buffalo in the m y t h
would also indicate t h a t it is of eastern provenience. Stories possessing song
recitatives may be presumed to be of a western provenience. See Sapir,
op. cit., pp. 471-472.
    Only two m y t h s were recorded with the appropriate recitatives: "" G r a y
Hawk and Toad g a m b l e "" (pp. 414-426) and "" T h e Badger People wage War
against Wolf and Coyote"" (pp. 432-444). T h e five types of recitative belonging
to these m y t h s have been given above. A supplementary set of six recitative
t y p e , is appended here with references to t h e m y t h s t h a t they belong to.
T h e speeches are given in the recorded m y t h s in the form of prose.

  I t should be noted t h a t the Paiute term translated "" C o y o t e "" in this and the
 following myths, cina'ywatt>i, is not the ordinary word for coyote, b u t is a

April 26, 1912, p. 673). T h e significance of the animals in this origin legend
lies in the fact t h a t the mourning songs of today are classified into four animal
categories: "" r o a n , "" coyote, bird, and mountain sheep.

Journal of American Folk-Lore, vol. X X I I I , 1910, p. 363), the three others

       The Indian name really means ""Stone-Clothes,"" but it was consistently

       This refers to the berry bush, which they had used as a landmark to
locate the cache of dried meat. Now that it was stripped of berries, they were
unable to recognize it.
   33
       The old woman and her great-grandson had escaped from the village
Iron-Clothes had destroyed. Had he thought the child was a boy, he would
have slain him, to prevent the possibility of his growing up and avenging
his kinsmen.

       She had not been in the habit of grinding seeds. She was secretly pre-
paring food for the rescuing party.
   39
      She had received a jack-rabbit from her sons, but claims to have caught
him herself by killing him with her seed-beater. Iron-Clothes doubts this,
as it looks to him as if the jack-rabbit had been hit in the eye with an arrow.
   40
      1, e., on former occasions the antelope had always warned of the approach
of danger by making the peculiar noise and immediately galloping off home.
His failure to appear this time arouses Iron-Clothes' suspicion.
   41
       He stretched himself because he had just gotten up and was still sleepy.

       Instead of passing through and killing them. They were endowed with
magical power and could not be killed by ordinary arrows.

       This tale of Chipmunk and the Giant seems to correspond to the Sho-
shone trickster cycle of the Giant Dzoavits. In the Shoshone tales the place
of Chipmunk is generally taken by Weasel or Mosquito. See Lowie, The
Northern Shoshone, pp. 254-262.

      I t is not the ordinary rat that is meant, but the wood rat, found in great
quantities near St. George, Nev., and used as food by the Indians.
   "" Rat had butchered the deer on leaves and branches in order to prevent
traces of the meat from showing on the earth. By burning the leaves and
branches he destroyed all traces of the butchering.
   *4 This incident argues a knowledge on the part of the Paiute Indians of
the custom of burning the dead. The custom, however, was not practiced
by the Paiutes themselves. This point may eventually help to determine
from what tribe or area the widespread story of the ""hoodwinked dancers""
came to the Paiute.
   "" Tony was not quite certain if the story ended at this point or not.

              The bark referred to is of a cedar-like tree (ina'p 'i) and is yellowish in
       color. Stockings were made of it as well.
           80
              This was not Coyote, first spoken of, but ""the idle Coyote,"" pro catamito
       usus in loco feminae. Coyote, on returning from the hunt, was the first to
       make use of him, after which he proceeded to the other camps. After the
       arrival of the Badger-wives his usefulness vanished. The Wolf and Coyote
       people had no women before this.
          81
              I. e., pudenda. The meaning of Coyote's statement is that his compan-
       ions are to have nothing to do with the women.

          ·· This is merely a fragment of what Tony believed to be a long story.
      Eagle's song (see III, 1, p. 478) belongs to this story at a point antecedent to
      the events recounted in this fragment. The tale is a typical suitor myth
      and corresponds, in a general way, to Lowie's ""Lodge-Boy and Thrown-away ""
       (see Lowie, The Northern, Shoshone, pp. 280-283).

              It is quite likely that the conception of Rattlesnake as ""grandfather""

              Coyote was looking for a pretext to go to her house, so as to have a
      chance to see the young woman.
         77
              When held down by the woman, Gray Hawk made a noise, thus leading
      Coyote to infer that something was wrong. He thought that Hawk was
      attacked and made as if to help him by aimlessly shooting at Hawk's supposed
      enemies.

        Mamputs, chief of the Cedar City Paiutes, is supposed to have been
 traveling about and to have returned from the country of the Southern Utes.
 He had a mannerism of addressing everyone by a term of relationship, by
 way of being friendly. An older man he addressed as "" f a t h e r , "" an older
 woman as ""mother,"" a very old man or woman as "" g r a n d f a t h e r "" or ""grand-
 mother,"" young men or women as "" b r o t h e r s "" and ""sisters."" This method
of address was not, however, according to Tony, the regular practice of all
chiefs.

        It was taboo for a boy, up to the age of about sixteen, to eat game that
he had killed himself, as this would make him weak and lazy. Eagle, who is
merely a stripling, intends to break the taboo, apparently as a sign that he is
old enough to seek a wife.

        This is merely a fragment of a myth. Tony remembered only the song,
but was not clear as to its context. A certain character, he did not remember
just who, used to hide in the bush from morning till night and sing this song,
using the leg bones of his own parents as a rattle. He was caught at this.","[547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558]"
"                           § 24.   Noun suffixes.
  (1)   A B S O L U T I V E OR CLASSIFYING ELEMENTS. Many nouns end in
a suffix that either suggests classification of the noun under a general
category or that has little assignable significance except to render the
noun absolute. Some of these elements disappear in composition
or when the noun is used with a possessive pronominal enclitic, others
may or may not. Some nouns appear with or without an absolutive
suffix, e. g. rii'yw'L and riiywints· PERSON.
   (a) -vi-n, -p i-"", -mpi-n absolutive suffix implying indefiniteness
or non-specification of possessor. These elements, which immediately
follow the stem, are used with nouns expressing objects, persons, or
relations that can hardly be thought of except in connection with
other objects or persons, e. g. terms of relationship, body-part nouns,
and substantivized local concepts (e. g. BOTTOM, SURFACE). They
may be rendered by SOMEBODY'S, OF SOMETHING or, preferably, left
untranslated. They always disappear with pronominal enclitics and
in composition.

vided with absolutive -ρϊ-' and t h a t they are really compound nouns
whose second element, -ρϊ-', is shortened (see § 11) from pTi-',
ρϊ-' HIDE (see above; -vi-' of ρΰ'φϊ HIDE itself, however, is clearly
absolutive).
    Apparently distinct from absolutive -vi-', though not easy to keep
apart from it, is -νϊ- (-ρ ϊ- and -mp'i- are not found alternating with it)
suffixed to nouns used in some specialized or metaphorical sense.
These nouns are generally compounds. When possessive enclitics
are added, possessive -a- (see 2, a below) is generally suffixed to
-vi-. Examples are:

tory -tsi-n or diminutive -ISL- (§ 35), e. g. a'ip ATS• B O Y , plur. -UITJW'L.
  A number of inanimate nouns also end in -tsi- (apparently not
diminutive -tsi-), e. g.:wii'ts• knife: wiirfwinapi knife-point, wi 'p u'cayai-         to look for a
  knife
mara'ts• metate: ma'RA me täte
mo'a'ts- stone mealer  Such nouns as these corroborate Shoshonean comparative evidence,
which shows that *-ti, *-ta (S. Californian -t, -I; S. Paiute -tsi-) was
originally used, like its Nahuatl cognate -tl(i), for all types of nouns.
In Paiute, however, this element tended largely to become restricted
to animate (including particularly personal) nouns.

This suffix is compounded of -vi-', -p'i-, -τηρϊ-' (see d above) and
animate -f»i-n (see f above). I t is also quite possible that some of

   (2) E L E M E N T S DEFINING POSSESSION. Here are grouped a number
of suffixes that appear chiefly with possessive pronominal enclitics and
which, on the whole, define the nature of the possessive relation.
It is not always easy, as a matter of fact, to see exactly what increment
of significance they bring.
   (a) -a- seems to be used to indicate possession that is alienable,
particularly, it would seem, of such objects as are not normally
thought of as being possessed. It is generally preceded by -ρϊ-*
(see 1, d and e). Examples are:
fivwi'piariimi     our (excl.) country {-riimi our); RVwL ρ 'Laiariimi our
   country (obj.) (-ία- objective, § 49, 1).
ρα·'""νϊαηι spring that I own
a'oTjqovianl my dried-up woods
üyqa'nivia(i)ya'i)WA his cave (obj.) owned as house (-ya- objective);
   fiijqa'nLviatsia^i  his own little cave (obj.) (-tsi- diminutive; -a-
   objective; -φϊ, § 40, 4)
  Possessive -a- may also be used with causative -tui- (§ 29, 12)
to form verbs indicating ΤΟ CAUSE TO HAVE SO AND SO, e. g.:
tumpwi' Apiiplya' caused (it) to have stones
qan-L Atuip lya   caused (it) to have houses
nayqa'Atuip 'iya caused (it) to have branches
   For possessive -a- combining with verbalizing -kai- το HAVE into
-ayai- (participle -ayaiifi-), see § 26, 1, b; for possessive -a- after
past passive participial -ρ ϊ-, see 3, b below.
   (b) -rjwa-, -t)'wa-. These elements are used very much like -α-,
occurring both before possessive pronominal enclitics and verbalizing
-kai- το HAVE, not, however, before causative -tui-.    They do not
seem to be used after elassificatory -pi- (1, d and e), but may be
directly appended to noun stems. Examples of -ψνα- are:
pai'ywani  my blood (absolute pai'p r, in possessive forms of this
  noun -ywa- is always used)

   (§ 25, 6, a)-possessive-my, snow belonging to me (snow-raining =
   snow)   Examples of -rfwa- (it is not clear how, if a t all, it differs in usage
from -rjwa-) are:tümp'°i'y'wa i)A his rock
ma'xarir'iijwa(i)yayA    his clump of trees (obj.)
qa-'n(uinüTj'wa yA sing-become (§ 26, 1, g)-present ptc. (§ 25, 6, a)-
  possessive-his, song belonging to him   Both -ywa- and -rfwa- are used particularly to indicate possession
of one of a group by the group (e. g. OUR LEADER = THAT ONE OF US
WHO is LEADER). This includes adjectival participles indicating
selection (e. g. THE GOOD ONE of several). Examples are:nia 'vuj'waraywA our chief; qani'ayanfiA nia 'viij'wA house-possessive-
   having-obj. chief-possessive, village's chief
ampa'xarirj'wa m i talker- possessive-their, their talker; qan i ayanti

fWi'tc at vr)wa{i)'yaq wA very good-present ptc.-obj.-their (inan.),
   a very good one of them (inan.)   (c) - a- is used to indicate possession, chiefly of body-parts, t h a t
is inherent without being strictly inalienable. In other words, it
is suffixed to nouns indicating objects (or persons) t h a t do often
occur disconnected in experience (e. g. SALIVA, BONE, SKIN) but are
thought of as indissolubly connected. Examples are:

    (obj.)  (d) -in'{n)i-' (-'in i-') OWNED. This element is always employed
with alienable nouns and has a specific reference to actual ownership
as contrasted with mere possession in the grammatical sense. Ex-
amples are:

they are first verbalized. This is generally done by suffixing -Icai- ΤΟ BE
(§ 26, 1, a) and then turning the denominative verb into a participle.
Thus, the future form of qava-' HORSE is qava 'xaiva nti HORSE-BE-
FUTURE-PARTICIPLE, A HORSE ΤΟ BE; similarly, qam 'i'xawätci JACK-
RABBIT-BE-USITATIVE-PARTICIPLE, ALWAYS A JACKRABBIT.             Here we
shall specifically list only two compound suffixes relating to past
time, because of their rather characteristic usage.   (a) -yaip'i-,      -qaip-ϊ-,        -ijqaip· Ϊ-   HAVING     BEEN,   PAST,   FORMER;
compounded of -Icai- ΤΟ BE and past participial -pi-                    (see § 25, 5, a).
Examples are:
ini'ayaipini      my dead relation < ini'a ni my relative
muru""ιχαίρ i cast-away blanket
o'tca'(vi)yaip ϊ formerly used water-jar (o't-CA)
qa'yaaitlaxaipia'aywA      rat-hunt-place-be-past partic.-obj.-his, place
   (obj.) where he used to h u n t rats
tma'uykaipi      punch-er-be-past partic., one who used to be a puncher
   (b) -p i- PAST, FORMER. This is the past participial -p i- (see § 25,
5, a), only rarely used with noun stems, e. g.:
qanip'i     abandoned house, village site, old camping place
  I t is sometimes found combined with possessive -a- (2, a) as                    -ρϊα-,
e. g.:
a'i<t>Api(y)anyivw'ini            youth-past-possessive- friend-my, my former
   youthful friend
  This -ρ ϊα- occurs also combined with other elements in verbal
forms (see -p'ia-yai-tua-, § 32, 8; -p 'ia-yi-, § 32, 7)                              § 25. Nominalizing          suffixes.
   These are formed chiefly from verb and adjective-verb stems. The
verbal noun in -n a- and the various participles are in very frequent,
in part idiomatic, use.

"    Numerous reduplicated forms have already been quoted in the
course of this paper. The process is freely used both in nouns and,
especially, in verbs. It is frequently accompanied by glottalization
or consonantal gemination or both. The reduplication is practically
always initial; only a few cases of morphologically non-significant
final reduplication occur. An initial vowel (v) reduplicates to v'v'-
( V V-, 'v'-). If the word begins with a consonant + vowel (cv),
the reduplication includes both (cv-', rarely cv '-). A stem, however,
that has a nasal consonant following initial stopped or affricative
consonant + vowel (cvc n ) includes the nasal in the reduplication
(cv-""'); the nasal of the reduplicating syllable is assimilated, if neces-
sary, to the first consonant of the stem. The consonant following a
reduplicating cv- may be either spirantized or geminated, according
to type. Verbs and nouns with reflexive prefix na- reduplicate the
na-, not the stem; verbs with instrumental prefixes reduplicate the
prefix, not the stem (e. g. verbs in ta-s WITH THE FOOT reduplicate to
tA'ta'-""). In the following, examples of reduplication are classified
as to function, secondarily as to phonetic type.
  (1) CONSTANTLY REDUPLICATED NOUNS. A small number of
nouns occurs only in reduplicated form. The reduplication seems
to have no morphological significance. Reduplicating types ev-B

Shamans   Anyone, a man or woman, 113 may be a medicine-man ('medicine-
woman', manma E umpuwaxant""). The power of doctoring is not acquired
by a period of fasting or training in the mountains, but may be acquired
in the ordinary course of life (after puberty and before 30 — 40 years of
age) by dreaming. Every medicine-man has his guardian spirit who helps
him and who is appealed to by one or more songs. Every spirit has his
special songs; these seem to have no intelligible words. Knowledge of
the songs was gained by dreaming of them. One of the most powerful
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes             831of the medicine spirits was the eagle. As soon as the medicine-man
begins his song, the guardian spirit, no matter how far away at the time,
approaches, and from a distance communicates with the medicine-man,
telling him of the whereabouts of the sickness. All this is quite invisible
to the ordinary people about. It is told that in a tepee during the night,
when a medicine-man was doctoring, a sound as of the whirring of an
eagle's wings was heard descending clear down to where the poles meet
on top on the outside. Someone went out to see, but could see no eagle.
It was the medicine-man's eagle guardian that had come to answer the
medicine-man's call. In doctoring the medicine-man would sometimes
sit by the patient (generally at night) and sing his medicine-song; at
times he would get up and sing (no regular dance). Sometimes he sang
alone, sometimes others present sang with him, following his song. In
a very severe case, several medicine-men might be used, each singing
his own song. A medicine-man might give some of his power away to
others, as by giving them his songs. If he ""divides"" his power too much,
he loses in efficacy; thus it happens that some medicine-men, in growing
older, are less able to cure disease. Part of the doctoring consisted of
sucking the point where the pain was most acute. 114
   The disease could be extracted in some visible form. Once Tony saw
a medicine-man show everyone present at the doctoring a colorless
round object like a glass marble as the pain he had extracted. Tony
made fun of him and said that he had merely taken a glass marble to
show the people. Some time after, the medicine-man came over to him
as he was lying in camp and stroked him, saying some more or less
unintelligible words. His folks were there at the time and were greatly
frightened, thinking the medicine-man was taking his revenge and that
Tony would die. But Tony did not die, and within a year the medicine-
man himself died. He was not considered much of a medicine-man.
After this Tony was pointed out by his uncle as a wonderful boy.
   One time Tony, when a young boy, felt so sleepy that he slept during
the last night of the ""cry,"" which was strictly forbidden. Everyone was
talking about it the next morning, when they found out. Some time
after, Tony fell sick. A noted medicine-man then in Arizona (Trumbull
Mountain) was called; he was sleeping then, but got up immediately
and went. The first two nights his doctoring was not very successful;
only the third night did he say that his spirit was coming and that he
was beginning to see. Tony then recovered. He was given a horse in
payment.
832                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
   A medicine-man might be powerful enough to be immune in battle,
even from bullets. There was one medicine-man who had this power;
moreover, any horse he rode could be shot in only one place, the
forehead.
   Once a party of two or three Utes, one of them a medicine-man, were
attacked by a party of cowboys. They put all to flight except the
medicine-man. He dismounted and quietly stood near his horse; they
kept shooting at him, but could not harm him. He shot at them and
killed two or three; the rest galloped off.
   Medicine-men did not bargain for a particular payment before doc-
toring. If they succeeded in curing the patient, they would be paid
anything at all.
   A certain medicine growing along the shores of the Colorado River
could be used to keep away rattlesnakes, who do not like its smell. It
could be attached in a bundle to the boot of a person walking in the
bush; it might also be rubbed on a horse.
   A sick horse could be cured by gashing him and turning him loose.
After a few weeks he would recover.
   One method of curing a horse with a bad sore was to cut a gash in
the skin above the wound and slip in a quarter. After a while the horse
would recover and the quarter could be taken out.
   Medicine-men generally sit down when singing; when dancing they
do so alone, their step consisting of a sort of stamping and shaking of
the body; they did not dance circularly, but back and forth. Their power
was obtained by dreaming, but not away from home.
   A medicine-man that Tony once knew used an eagle feather fan. He
scattered ashes with it on his patients. He began his doctoring by calling
upon Wolf: ""Our father, who made heaven and earth."" This is the only
time he ever heard any Indian make such a prayer.
   One time a small party of Kaibab Paiutes, including Tony and Dick,
who was something of a medicine-man because Mamputs had parted
with some of his power to him, camped for the night at Maä(vu)xarTr
""Brush Lake"" on Kaibab Plateau, a place considered particularly liable
to being haunted by ghosts or evil spirits. They were lying in the tent,
when suddenly right near them they heard a loud sharp whistle that
could not have been made by a bird or any other animal. They imme-
diately thought of a ghost and huddled together in fear. Dick, as
medicine-man, quietly said, ""Let me smoke now,"" and took out his
tobacco to roll a cigarette. (Smoking is here doubtless considered a
charm against evil spirits.) After a while they heard the sound of giggling
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic   Field   Notes        833near them; perhaps the ghost was laughing at them for their fear. Soon
also the ringing of horses' bells was heard coming near; they had been
frightened by something. Next morning they were found way down a
canyon, having been scared away from the grazing ground.
    When it was suggested to Tony that Dick himself had made the
sounds in order to have an opportunity for showing off his medicine
power, he scouted the idea, saying that a real medicine-man would never
fool people.
    The medicine-man who cured Tony told of the following experience
he had undergone. Once he was out hunting for game, but met with
little or no success. At last he saw a lot of porcupine tracks that led to
a hole in the ground. He waited for them to come out. At last he saw
them come out and began to chase them. He kept chasing them until
they scampered off into a hole, he following them. One porcupine in
particular always kept just a little ahead of him and kept drawing him
on. At last he found himself in a great open underground country, the
porcupines having disappeared. He saw a man walking along at a
distance and hailed him; he directed him to the camp of the people.
People lived there about as in the upper world, except that they hunted
at night. He tried to do so too but could do nothing. When they
returned from the hunt, they had a lot of buffalo meat. They did not
eat the meat after it was prepared, but merely smelled it and then threw
it away. He picked up some of the meat to eat it, but they cried out to
him, ""Don't, it is excrement."" He did not mind, however, but went
ahead and ate it and found it tasted very good. When he defecated, one
of their men tried to eat his excrement but did not find it to his liking.
During the day these people slept and, as he could see as he walked
around, also copulated in full view. After a while he retraced his steps
and found an exit to the upper world through the hole he had entered.
On returning home he found he had been away quite some time and
that his wife was missing him. It seems the people in that lower world
were porcupines in human form. 115
   Some medicine-men claim to be able to make rain. One Kaibab
medicine-man used to make this claim. Once, when there had been a
long drought, the Indians angrily expostulated with him for not bringing
on rain. He said nothing, but about an hour after there was a very
severe rainstorm, although the sky had looked quite clear. Some Indians
thought it was merely an accident, others credited the rain to the
medicine-man: some jocosely wanted to compel him to stay out in the
rain because he had made them be caught unawares without adequate
834                       X Southern Paiute and Ute
provision for shelter. That day the medicine-man said nothing, but the
next day he claimed that the rain had been caused by his power, though
he had not sung his medicine song or in any other way made visible
use of his power.
   As rattlesnake cure was used päxuntünAv11, a plant growing to the
height of about three feet on the sides of wooded mountains (Kaibab)
with leaves and stalks like carrot. 116 If the root is given to a snake, it
will turn its head. It is often tied in little bundles, one to each ankle, to
keep snakes away. When one is bitten, he chews at the root and puts it
on the wound, when it heals. This was tested also in the case of a horse
bitten by a snake. Tony says he was told by Archie Qumala 117 that the
Hopi use the same root as medicine in the snake dance, and that its
odor keeps the snake from biting.
   If one is bitten by a scorpion, a fire is built outside the house. The
wounded person jumps over the fire and, while doing so, calls his own
name. He has to confess any misdeed he has done, such as rape, before
any people about who care to listen. He jumps as often as desired. If
he does not do so, his wound swells and he is liable to die.","[834, 835, 836, 837, 838]"
"
Bull-Roarer    The bull-roarer was often used by children in play to make a wind.
The old folks, however, would not like it sometimes and would take it
away and burn it up. The reason is that the buzz calls the evil spirits
('inipits).166Miscellaneous Customs 1 6 7   This was the old Indian custom in greeting: to grasp each other's
hands, but not necessarily shake; called tiyfvwutcaEai'.
   Greeting is maik"" or mäikywäc"".168 On the coming of a man from
another tribe, nearly everybody gathers around to hear the news; after
a while he tells what he has to say: if he has nothing to say, he simply
says he is going around just for fun. There is no salutation corresponding
to ""good-bye.""
   Still the Paiutes had no sign-language.
   If one sneezed, it meant that someone was speaking of him.
   The following joke was sometimes indulged in: If a stranger with his
bow came along, one of the home fellows might take his bow and slip
it along on the ground on the broad outer side of the bow. If it fell
862                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
resting with the string toward the stranger, it showed that his penis had
been ""skinned.""
   If rats were troublesome in the house, a man would station himself
near a rat-hole and call the rats by squealing with tightly pressed lips.
He was ready to shoot the rat as it appeared with bow and arrow.
   Bull-roarers were whirred in order to cause the wind to blow.169

"   (3) PERIPHRASTIC CONSTRUCTIONS WITH POSTPOSITIONS.           While
postpositions may be used with noun stems (e. g. qani'ntcuqWA
HOUSE-UNDER), there is a tendency for postpositions to attach them-
selves by preference to pronouns and demonstrative stems. Hence the
type noun + postposition is often replaced by its periphrastic equiva-
lent: noun (obj.), pronoun (or demonstrative stem) + postposition;
the noun may follow. An independent objective pronoun may also
be thus periphrastically used with a pronominal or demonstrative
stem.

likely to be etymologically identical with the verbal subordinating
-yu- (see § 55,1, c). The translation ACTING that has been given for it
in the preceding entries is only an awkward approximation to its
significance. I t seems to indicate t h a t the action of the verb takes
place under the circumstances indicated in the postpositional phrase,
which may thus be conceived of as subordinately verbified.

"  (2) A B S O L U T E V E R B FORMS. A S has been abundantly illustrated,
verb forms, even aside from nominal derivatives (§ 25, 1-6), often
appear without either enclitic or suffixed tense elements. Such
forms may be conveniently termed absolutes. They are used under
various circumstances:
   (a) When tense (and pronominal) elements arc appended to an-
other preceding word in the sentence, the verb appears as an absolute,
e. g.:
               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean     Language

a'itcayani qu'qwi then-preterit-him (vis.)-I shoot, then I shot him;
   contrast qu'qwi'tea-yaw I shot him
   (b) In imperative forms (see § 52).
   (c) Frequently in interrogative forms, where reference is had to
present time.
   (d) Generally substantive verbs (aro'a-, uru'a-, § 56) have no
present suffix, present (or general) time being implied when there is
no tense suffix.
   (e) Verbs of BEING and HAVING in -Icai- (§ 26, 1, a and b) take no -xji-
toexpress present time, but are tenseless, e. g. qant!%aini I HAVE A
HOUSE.    It is probable that in such cases -Icai- represents an old
contraction of -kai-y'i-, as the -y'i- reappears after an intervening
impersonal 4-ua- (see § 29, 14; § 32, 8).","[252, 253]"

Southern Paiute Dictionary
                              PREFACE.
   The following dictionary of Southern Paiute is based on the Paiute
texts which form the second part of this volume and on the gram-
matical and lexical notes which were secured from Tony Tillohash at
the same time as the texts. I t is in no sense a complete dictionary
of the language but necessarily includes only such material as I
happened to record. The entries and the examples which follow
must always be understood in the light of a knowledge of the funda-
mental Paiute sounds and their changes. In other words, the
dictionary presupposes Part I, for it would be impracticable to give
chapter and verse for each phonetic rule that is illustrated in the
examples.
   The purpose of the dictionary is twofold: to assist the student in
the analysis of the texts; and to provide the future student of com-
parative Shoshonean with the lexical materials that he will need.
No attempt has been made to heap examples, which in most instances
would add nothing that is not already evident from the entries
themselves and the phonology and morphology of Paiute as described
in Part I. On the other hand, distinctive derivatives of stems and
compounds are given where available. Cross-references to the texts,
indicated by page and line numbers, are given sparingly and with
attention to their value for the student.
   The dictionary includes all noun and verb (including adjective)
stems, pronouns, adverbs, and interjections recorded. Of the elements
which cannot occur unless preceded or followed by other elements it
includes noun and verb stems which occur only as second elements in
compounds, enclitics (including pronominal enclitics), postpositions, and
prefixes. I t does not include as independent entries the derivational
and relational suffixes described and illustrated in the grammar.
If an entry, such as an enclitic or postposition, is treated in the
grammar, it is merely listed without examples and with the appro-
priate reference to Part I.

                        INTRODUCTORY NOTE
   The order of the letters of the Paiute alphabet used in this dictionary
is based on that of the letters of the English alphabet, except that
certain letters, symbolizing secondary sounds, are considered mere
variants of others, symbolizing primary sounds. Thus, ν is considered
a variant of p; r, of t; k and y, of q; kw and yw, of qw; c, of s; ts, of tc;
and o, of u.
   The order, then, of initials and medials in the main entries is as
follows:
                 Initial                         Medial
                    a                              -a-
                    i                              -i-
                    ϊ                              -Ϊ-
                    m                               -m-
                    n                              -n-
                                                   -η-
                                                   -qw-
                    o                              -o-
                    P                              -p-
                    q (k)                          -q- (-k-)
                                                   -y-
                    qw (kw)                        -q w- (-k w-)
                                                   -yvf-
                    s (c)                          - S - (-C-)
                    t                               -t-
                                                   -r-
                    tc (ts)                        -tc- (-ts-)
                                                   -t c- (-t s-)
                    u (o)                          -U- ( - 0 - )
                    w
                    y                              -y-
                                                   -' (only as enclitic)
   Of the nasalized stops, -mp- comes after -mo-; -nt- comes after
-no-·, -ψι~ comes after -T)3-\ and -ijqw- comes after -ijq-. A redupli-
cating syllable does not count. Further, note that ' or h plus vowel
is considered equivalent to that vowel. Long vowels or repeated
vowels summing to two moras (e. g., aa — a ) come after short
vowels; syllables affected by ' (whether of type 'a or a', which are
                         X Southern Paiute and Ute
540                                   SAPIR
considered equivalent) come after equivalent syllables not so affected.
Thus, for words with initial α the order is:
                                 a    (""a, ha)
                                 a-   (aa)
                                'a    (a', a'a)
                                 ä    (ii'j ä j et- ä j
   The main entries and sub-entries are given as stems and elements
in a thoroughly normalized form, no vocalic variants (e. g., t for ϊ)
being recognized. All voiceless vowels are restored to their voiced
form. This means that no voiceless spirants are entered, for these
are merely secondary forms of voiced spirants before voiceless vowels.
Non-initial stops following voiceless vowels are restored to their
fundamental geminated form. E. g., the recorded qA'qa'RA appears
as the entry qaq ara-. On the other hand, the actually recorded
forms, which follow these theoretically fixed entries, are given as
notated, with all their regular phonetic changes and in their heard
variants. Final -* after consonant, however, is regularly restored to
its proper voiceless vowel; e. g., qani'ay' would be given as qaniai)A.
There are also other slightly regularizing changes which will help the
student. For compounded stems beginning with -ν-, see p-; with
-τ-, see <-; with -γ-, see q- (k-); with -yw-, see qw- (Jew-); with -ψο-,
see w- or m- (a few cases of -yw-, however, where the evidence for
derivation from w- or m- is lacking, are separately entered under
-ψν-).
  The main entries are in roman small capitals (the vowels are in these
always to be interpreted as fundamental voiced vowels). Under
these the sub-entries are given in indented italic form; they consist
of derivatives of the main entries.
   The following symbols are used:
(     )   enclose inorganic element, i. e. element which is not theor-
            etically present; e. g., o( ) indicates short a which is secondar-
            ily lengthened, y(a)i indicates parasitic a
          separates radical elements and affixes from each other; does
            not indicate syllabic division
*         indicates long vowel resulting from contraction of vowels
            belonging to distinct morphological elements, e. g. qaru'-a-rjA
            from qani'-a-aTjA
:         separates normalized, theoretical forms from forms as actually
            recorded

  English Index to Sapir's Southern Paiute                Dictionary                                   W i c k R . MillerIntroduction   This index was prepared more than 25 years ago, when I was working
on my Uto-Aztecan Cognate Sets (Miller 1967). The index was prepared
to facilitate the identification of cognates. It is not a complete index:
items that I felt would not be useful for finding cognates, at least not
by locating them in an English index (e.g., place names), were left out.
In some cases, items were not entered under their exact English trans-
lations, but rather under headwords that would facilitate locating cog-
nates, based on what I knew of Uto-Aztecan (in hindsight, I can see it
was often what I thought I knew). Further, the reader should bear in
mind that the glosses in the index are often incomplete; they should be
used only for finding the entry in the Southern Paiute dictionary itself.
   The reader will observe that the headwords in Sapir's Dictionary are
transcribed in a systematic phonological notation, not used in the
Grammar, but representing a partial phonemic analysis of Southern
Paiute. Following these headwords, Sapir gave his subentries and ex-
amples in the phonetic transcription used in his Grammar. This Index
uses a system based on Sapir's phonemic analysis; however, I have made
some changes in Sapir's original transcription, as follows:               Sapir's       original         Index                         q                       k

Sapir wrote fronted [k] in a few cases; I doubt that these contrast with
Ik/, but they have been maintained as in the original. Sapir normally
754                          X Southern Paiute and Ute
wrote initial vowels; but, in some words, he placed a glottal stop before
the vowel, for what was probably the same thing phonemically. Again,
I kept the transcription as Sapir had it. The phonemic position of non-
initial glottal stops (especially of glottalized consonants) is not clear;
with no clear understanding of their analysis, I kept them as Sapir had
them. Medial geminated obstruents were rewritten as /h/ plus the ob-
struent, while the medial spirantized forms were rewritten as single
medial obstruents. Long vowels were rewritten as double vowels. Sapir
also wrote double vowels, which were distinct from long vowels. Numic
cognates show that, etymologically, these sequences arose from *VhV;
thus I wrote them V(h)V — for example, 'fat, grease' yu(h)u-s (cf.
Shoshoni yuhu).acorn (?): tomi-n

                  Ethnographic Field Notes
       Edited by Catherine S. Fowler and Robert C. Euler   The two works in this section contain the bulk of the ethnographic notes
made by Edward Sapir in conjunction with his Southern Paiute and Ute
linguistic work in 1909 and 1910. In August and September, 1909, Sapir
 — then newly appointed Instructor in Anthropology at the University of
Pennsylvania — conducted linguistic field work among the Ute of Utah
under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Museum. In the
company of graduate student J. Alden Mason, he visited the Uintah-Ouray
Reservation, where he worked for a short time on Uncompahgre Ute at
Fort Duchesne; he then went on to Whiterocks, where he worked on the
Uintah dialect. While at Whiterocks, his principal consultant was Charlie
Mack, from whom he recorded seven Uintah tales (published in Sapir
1930e, this volume). Upon his return, Sapir published a brief note on some
phonetic and grammatical aspects of Ute (Sapir 1910c).
   In January, 1910, Sapir went to Carlisle Indian School, south of Har-
risburg, Pennsylvania, to look for a Ute speaker among the students. There
he met Tony Tillohash, a young speaker of Kaibab Southern Paiute, which
Sapir suspected to be linguistically close to Ute. Tillohash had been at
Carlisle for about five years and was just finishing his course of study.
With the help of the school superintendent and the director of the Uni-
versity Museum, Sapir arranged for Tillohash to come to Philadelphia.
From February through May, 1910, Tillohash worked as a janitorial as-
sistant at the museum as well as with Sapir. He served as consultant for a
seminar on American Indian languages which Sapir was offering, and in
which Mason was a student (Mason to Euler, May 22, 1956). Through
the intensive work during this four-month period, Sapir was able to record
sufficient data from Tillohash for a full treatment of Kaibab Southern
Paiute, including a grammar, texts, and a dictionary (Sapir 1930d, 1930e,
1931k, this volume). He also produced a 106-page manuscript of notes on
Kaibab ethnography, and recorded the texts and music of some 200
Southern Paiute songs. These data, which far eclipsed those he had ob-
tained on Ute, would be used by Sapir in additional works in historical,
780                       X Southern Paiute and Ute
comparative, and theoretical linguistics (Sapir 1913f, 1933c; see the intro-
duction to this volume), and in the preliminary description of Southern
Paiute musical forms (Sapir 191 Od). The friendship that developed among
Tillohash, Sapir, and Mason was genuine and rewarding.
   Following the work in Philadelphia, Tillohash returned home to Kai-
bab, Arizona, and after a few years moved to the Shivwits Southern Paiute
Reservation in southwestern Utah, where he married and spent most of
the rest of his life. He and his wife Bessie raised a large family; Tillohash
worked primarily as a ranch hand. He served as Shivwits tribal chairman
for many years, from the mid-1930s until the 1960s. He retained an active
intellectual interest in his culture, serving as an interpreter for ethnogra-
phers including Isabel Kelly, Philip Drucker, and Omer Stewart during
the 1930s and 1940s, and as an ethnographic consultant for Robert Euler
in the 1950s and for Catherine Fowler in the 1960s (Fowler and Fowler
1986).
   The ethnographic manuscripts edited for this publication have rather
complex histories. As noted above, the Kaibab manuscript is essentially
a single document, undoubtedly written over the four-month period of
the Tillohash-Sapir collaboration. Since the notes were made at least in
part during linguistic elicitation, the original manuscript follows no
particular or logical order. Rather, it covers each isolated topic in one
or several paragraphs of notes, separated from the next topic or set by
a penned line; occasionally, as with the Kaibab names for springs, the
material is from a specific elicitation. At some unknown date, probably
before 1930, Sapir had a typescript made from this manuscript, to which
he added a few miscellaneous ethnographic notes gleaned from his
Kaibab linguistic notebooks. Then, perhaps in preparation for publi-
cation, Sapir cut up a copy of the typescript and clipped together the
sections related to each topic, giving each a tentative title.
   The Ute manuscript has a slightly different but related history. During
his 1909 field trip to Ute country, Sapir kept his linguistic and ethnographic
notes in the same notebooks. As the purpose of his trip was primarily
linguistic, much of what he obtained of ethnographic significance was
written as brief comments or marginal notes to lexical or textual material.
While transcribing texts, Sapir wrote on the right-hand sheets of his note-
books only, using the left-hand sheets for footnotes and other comments.
It is thus on the left-hand pages that most of the Ute ethnographic notes
appear. (Exceptions to this are longer sections, such as Sapir's and Mason's
direct observations of facial painting designs at dances, notes on tipi con-
struction, and a few other topics.) Thus, even more than in the case of the
              Kaibab Paiute and Northern Ute Ethnographic Field Notes                781Kaibab notes, the Ute notes follow no plan of elicitation and are unsys-
tematic and incomplete. Again, at a later date Sapir had a typescript made
from these notes, apparently instructing the typist to excerpt any comment
lined to the side in the notebooks, in the order in which they appeared.
Sapir then cut up a copy of this typescript, arranged the sections by topic,
titled each section, and clipped the notes together. Sometimes sections are
attributed to specific consultants (Charlie Mack or John Duncan, Uintah;
Herbert Ariv, Uncompahgre); sometimes not.
    Apparently, not long before Sapir's death, 1 he gave these various
Southern Paiute and Ute ethnographic manuscripts (as well as other
unpublished manuscripts with ethnographic content) to Leslie Spier in
the hope that they would someday be published. Toward that end, Spier
gave a copy of the Ute typescript (along with some photographs by
Sapir and Mason) to Anne Cooke Smith, who had written her master's
thesis on Northern Ute material culture (Cooke 1937) and was in the
process of editing the thesis for general publication. Before giving the
material to Spier, Sapir apparently had also given a copy of the cut-up
version of the Kaibab notes to Isabel Kelly, a graduate student at the
University of California, Berkeley, who during 1932 and 1933 did
intensive field work among all the Southern Paiute groups under the
direction of Alfred L. Kroeber. Kelly employed Tony Tillohash as an
interpreter for her work among the Shivwits Southern Paiute. For some
reason, Sapir recalled the copy in Kelly's possession, with the promise
that she could have it again when she began to write up her data for
publication (Spier to Euler, May 22, 1956; Spier to Euler, June 26, 1956;
Spier to Jean Sapir, April 26, 1939). This version apparently came into
the hands of David Mandelbaum at the University of California, Berke-
ley, during his work of compiling selected published and unpublished
works of Sapir for publication (Mandelbaum 1949).
   In 1956, Robert Euler was at the University of California, Berkeley,
working on Southern Paiute ethnohistory in preparation for hearings
before the Indian Claims Commission. He saw the manuscript in Man-
delbaum's possession and was directed by Mandelbaum to Leslie Spier
for further information. Euler obtained copies of the cut-up versions of
1. In a letter to Jean Sapir, dated April 26, 1939, Spier outlines the manuscripts of
   Sapir's then in Spier's possession. This letter, following within two months of Sapir's
   death, seems to indicate that these materials were transferred before his death by
   Sapir himself, rather than afterward by his widow. The same supposition is made
   with reference to the materials given to Herzog (see below).
782                            X Southern Paiute and Ute
the Kaibab and Ute typescripts, as well as the loan of the original
handwritten Kaibab manuscript, from Spier. Euler relocated Tony Til-
lohash, then an alert man in his seventies, still living on the Shivwits
Reservation. Together they went over the content of Sapir's notes in
great detail, without Tillohash's knowing that Euler had the notes in
his possession. This proved to be a rare opportunity to test the reliability
of an informant through time. An analysis of Tillohash's statements in
1956 (and again in 1959) revealed that, in 92 percent of the responses,
he gave the same information as he had to Sapir in 1910 (Euler 1967).
Although Euler had planned to publish Sapir's Kaibab ethnographic
notes, other projects intervened and he was unable to do so.
   After Euler had checked the typescript against Sapir's original eth-
nographic manuscript for accuracy, he returned the original notes to
Spier. In 1957, Spier deposited the original and a copy of the Kaibab
typescript in the library of the American Philosophical Society, where
they are held today as part of the Boas Collection. The Sapir family
had deposited Sapir's original Ute and Southern Paiute linguistic note-
books, as well as a short (44-page) Kaibab lexical manuscript, at the
same institution in 1956.
   In 1964, Isabel Kelly published portions of her Southern Paiute data,
including her Kaibab notes (Kelly 1964). In this publication she incor-
porated numerous passages from Sapir's notes, along with some sketches
of models of artifacts made for Sapir by Tillohash, and photographs
obtained from Sapir of Tillohash demonstrating various skills. The
archive of Kelly's papers at the Department of Anthropology, Southern
Methodist University, contains a partial cut-up version of Sapir's Kai-
bab typescript, which had been either retained by Kelly or returned to
her by Spier at some unknown date 2 . As far as we have been able to
determine, the Sapir sketches Kelly published are preserved nowhere
else. A full set of Sapir's Tillohash photographs are in the photographic
archives of the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania.
   In 1974, Anne Cooke Smith published her Northern Ute materials,
in which she likewise incorporated data from Sapir's notes, along with
photographs by Sapir and Mason (Smith 1974). She then gave her copy
2. In a letter to Euler dated June 26, 1956, Spier notes that the manuscript in Man-
   delbaum's possession must have passed through Spier's hands en route to Kelly
   (based on marginal notes in both Spier's and Kelly's hands). Although at the time
   he did not recall the transfer, Spier indicates that he might well have sent it to Kelly
   at some time.
             Kaibab Paiute and Northern   Ute Ethnographic   Field   Notes   783of Sapir's notes to James A. Goss, now of Texas Tech University. Goss
kindly provided us with a photocopy of the material in his possession,
a carbon copy of the Ute typescript. The lexical data from this manu-
script, as well as the other Ute linguistic notes, were not incorporated
into the Southern Paiute dictionary; only the texts were published.
   Sapir's manuscript on Southern Paiute songs, presently being prepared
for publication in this series, has also been of some interest through the
years. Apparently in the 1930s, Sapir gave this manuscript, with musical
transcriptions of the songs made by his father Jacob Sapir, to George
Herzog, the renowned ethnomusicologist. At the same time, Sapir trans-
ferred other musical materials with the apparent hope that Herzog could
assist in bringing them to publication. In 1969, Indiana University grad-
uate student Charles Adams received the Southern Paiute song manuscript
from Herzog. He also obtained the wax cylinder recordings made by Sapir
with Tillohash from the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana Uni-
versity, where they had been transferred by the University of Pennsylvania
museum in 1961. Adams had enhanced copies made from the badly dam-
aged cylinders and reviewed their contents with Tillohash. He also re-
recorded from Tillohash, in 1969, the group of Mourning Ceremony songs
contained in the manuscript. In 1985, the Archives purchased Herzog's
papers from his estate, obtaining a photocopy of the original song text
and musical transcription manuscripts. However, other than Sapir's own
publication of the song recitatives from this collection (Sapir 191 Od), noth-
ing more of this music has been published. In the 1930s, Sapir made a
second, handwritten copy of the Mourning Ceremony texts from the col-
lection (more than half of the 200 songs) and sent it to John P. Harrington
of the Smithsonian Institution, with a request that Harrington confirm
Sapir's suspicion that the songs were in a Yuman language, perhaps Mo-
jave. This copy is retained in the Harrington Papers at the National An-
thropological Archives at the Smithsonian.
   The ethnographic works published in the present volume have the fol-
lowing sources. (1) The Kaibab manuscript is taken from Sapir's typescript
of his manuscript (Boas Collection, MS U.3, Library of the American
Philosophical Society), and includes most of the additions Sapir made
from his linguistic notebooks (a few were too fragmentary for presenta-
tion). (2) The Ute manuscript is from the cut-up version in Euler's pos-
session, checked against Sapir's original field notebooks. Both manu-
scripts have been reordered, rearranged, and in some cases retitled by the
editors. As noted above, Sapir apparently intended to do likewise, as he
cut up, reordered, and titled some sections of the Kaibab and Ute type-
784                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
scripts. The subject headings and subheadings used here retain Sapir's
wording in some cases, but in others do not. They parallel quite closely
the paradigm of presentation of ethnographies in the 1930s, the period
when Sapir was apparently arranging these manuscripts for publication.
   Sapir's Paiute orthography remains as it was in the original manu-
scripts. Table 1 (printed at the end of the Kaibab notes) was found
among his notes, and gives his changes from the original orthography
to that used in his publications of 1930 — 31. Most of the lexical items
that appear in the Kaibab manuscript also appear in the dictionary
(Sapir 1931k), and the handwritten version bears check marks, appar-
ently indicating such inclusion. None of the Ute lexical material appears
in the dictionary, nor, as noted above, does Sapir's other Ute material;
from the Ute notes, only the texts were prepared for publication.
   The endnotes to both works have been added by the editors as comments
on, or expansions of, the material presented by Sapir. They also note points
of agreement or disagreement with subsequent ethnographic work among
the Kaibab and the Ute, done by Kelly, Stewart, Smith, and others.
   The illustrations that accompany the manuscripts have been ably
redrafted by Patricia DeBunch from field sketches made by Sapir and
contained in the manuscripts. They retain the basic content and flavor
of the originals, but add some details for clarity. A few illustrations,
more in the character of brief diagrams contained in the body of
sentences or paragrahs, have been eliminated for ease of printing. In
these instances, Sapir's descriptive sentences have been modified to
incorporate data given in the drawings. Figure 6, showing Kaibab face-
painting, utilizes a standard form provided to Sapir by the University
Museum, and is reprinted here courtesy of the University of Utah Press.
DeBunch also drafted the maps which are included to orient readers to
this area of Native North America.
   Although some of these data of Sapir's have appeared elsewhere
(especially in Kelly 1964 and Smith 1974), this is the first time that the
materials have been published in their entirety. The data, though in

usitative participles (cf. § 25, 6, c) end in -ap atci-·, for negative forms
of ordinary active participles in -fi-, see 2, b below. T h i s suffix precedes
objective -ya-.     Examples are:qatc aro""° üvwa'isia'ap-A n o t it-is wolf-negative, it is n o t Wolf

    The negative active participle ends in -ywa'ait'i-, e. g.:qa nona'c irjwai't 'i not dreaming
gate"" 'a'{i)yuywai't \mi not one who is good (among) several  The negative correspondent of subordinating -kai- (§ 55, 1, b) is
-ywa'ai-yu- (§ 55, 1, c), e. g.:na 'may'waiYUcampa t),t      riiru'xwA   without saying anything, (give)
  him (vis.) to me  In certain forms -ywa'ai- is replaced by two-moraed -ywa'a-. The
negative form of subordinating -ku- (§ 55, 1, e) is -ywa'q u-, e. g.:tTqa'qarjwa'qucamparaijWA       eat-plural-negative-while-only-we (in-
  clus.), while we are not eating  There are absolute verb forms in -ψοα'αρα-, a suffix apparently
combining -ijwa'a(i)- and -apa- (see a). It is not evident how they
differ, if at all, from ordinary negative absolutes in - ap a-. Examples
are:
qatcu'tcami paa'iyoywa'ap ac υ not-preterit-they (vis.) countable
  (?)-negative-again, they were many in number (paiyo- is only
  used as negative verb; cf. qatcu'rarjWA paa'iyarjwa' aicv we (inclus.)
  are many)   Forms in -qwa'ap a-vi- seem to be agentives of negative absolutes
in -ywa'apa- (but cf. negatived agentives in -vi'ap a-, 1 above), e. g.:rii' qatc ampa'xAhtirjwa'ap αφι I not talk-cause-negative-agentive, I
    (am) one who causes not to talk, I do not allow to talk   (c) Negative forms of verbalizing -kai-. The verbalizing suffixes
-kai- το B E and -kai- το HAVE (see § 26, 1, a and b) become -ai- in the
negative. This - ai- takes the place of any specifically negative suffix.
  Examples are:

  The negative participle corresponding to positive -kanii-          BEING,
HAVING ( § 26, 1, a and b) is -ait-ϊ-,
                                  e. g.:
naijqa'vayant'i having ears              nayqa'w'ait-ϊ    earless
quna'qaxantimi having fire (plur.)       qa'tcu quna'i'nikaiiimL  not fire-
                                           owned-plural subject-not have-
                                           participle-plural, not having
                                           fire (plur.)
   As we have already seen (§ 32, 6), narrative past -p'iyai- is com-
pounded of past passive participle -ρ Ϊ- and -yai- ΤΟ HAVE. Its
negative correspondent is therefore -p'i'ai-\ -yai-p-'iyai- HAD —, WAS —
is doubly negatived to -αί-ρ-ϊ'αι-.       The negative correspondent of
participial -p'iyanfi- (§ 25, 6, e) is -p-V ait-ϊ-. Examples are:
qari'piya'    sat                        qa'tcu qar'i'p ui"" did not sit
p\ru'kaipiya' aikw A saw it              qa'tcu Ρini'k aip VA'aik WA did

   let go of any one                         never let go of any one
  The negative verbalizing -ai- appears as - a -, -a '- before subordi-
nating -q u-; -a-'q-u- WHEN HAS NOT, WHEN IS NOT thus corresponds
to positive -kaiyu-, e. g.:
c ci'nai)wavi(y)a 'q utuac ampA coyote (distributively)-not be-when-
   impersonal-only, though others were not coyote-like   (d) Negatives in -n a'ai-. A few verbs, chiefly verbs of sight, use
-n a'ai- as negative suffix instead of the normal -rjwa'ai- (b above);
participialized, -n a'ait i-. Unlike -rjwa'ai-, however, -n a'ai- pre-
cedes future -va - and is followed by narrative -p 'iyai-.
