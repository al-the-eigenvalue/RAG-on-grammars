"11.1. Word order
        Kakua has a predominant preference for an (S)OV order of constituents,
where the subject NP can be omitted under certain semantic and discourse conditions
(These conditions are discussed in Chapter 6 on case marking and grammatical
relations, and include animacy and accessibility.) Additionally, subject arguments
can be indexed on the predicate by means of cross-referencing proclitics that agree
in person and number with the subject argument, and gender for 3rd person singular
subject arguments. A detailed discussion of the criteria governing the omission or
full expression of subject argument NPs and cross-referencing proclitics is given in
Chapter 6.
        Whenever overtly expressed, the subject argument most frequently precedes
both the object(s) argument(s) and the verb. The verb is predominantly in final
position. The following examples illustrate this preferred SOV order of constituents.
An SV intransitive clause is illustrated in (1), an example in which the subject NP
of a transitive clause is omitted (OV) is illustrated in (2), and sentences with subject,
object, and verb are illustrated in (3)-(5):1) kǎnʔ        mi=ʔèh-ep=be=buh

      ‘Edgar gave a ball to Gabriel’        Alternatively, other orders are also accepted. However, when these occur,
they tend to be stricter as regards the morphological encoding of arguments. An OSV
order, for example, tends to favour the overt marking of case on the object argument,
and preferably also the overt expression of the subject cross-referencing proclitic on
the predicate:6) jegêʔ=diʔ fǐt         fĩ=waj ̀=na
   clothes=OBJ 1PL         1PL=pull=DECL
   ‘we sewed clothes’        The least accepted order seems to be VSO, followed by OVS. The latter was
accepted by speakers if the information given was visually witnessed, but even in
these cases it was considered as a rather odd order. The scale from most accepted to
least accepted, or from most preferred to least preferred (and least frequent) orders
conforms to the following scale. All of these orders are attested in naturally occurring
texts and elicitation:Figure 11.1 Acceptability scale of order of constituents in Kakua
 most preferred                                                  least preferred SOV >       OSV     >      OVS        >       SVO      >        VSO      >        VOS        The scale above shows that orders towards the least preferred end of the scale
are those in which the object argument follows the verb and the verb is not in final
position. Kakua’s preferred order, thus, can be described as basically OV.
        The scale shown above is based on general impressions of both texts and
elicitation. A more accurate description of these alternate orders would require a
quantitative approach of the occurrence of each of these orders throughout the
corpus.
        Clauses with adjuncts tend to place the adjunct immediately after the subject
of the clause. Other orders, however, are also found. The most common linear order
of constituents in a clause with an adjunct follows the template below:
                                                   Alignment and word order        307Figure 11.2 Most typical constituent order in clauses with adjuncts
        SUBJECT – ADJUNCT - OBJECT - VERB
       Examples (7)-(9) below illustrate intransitive (7), transitive (8), and
ditransitive clauses (9) with adjuncts. Note that in all cases the adjunct (highlighted
in boldface) follows the subject NP.","[326, 327, 328]"
"11.3 Subject alignment
       Subject arguments of intransitive verbs in Kakua are not treated distinctly
from those of transitive verbs. In other words, both A and S arguments behave in the
same way both morphologically and syntactically, exhibiting a prototypical
nominative-accusative type of morphosyntactic alignment: A=S≠P. Subject
arguments of a clause can be identified in two ways: they are NPs lacking
morphological marking for case (as opposed to other case-marked arguments), on
the one hand, and they trigger morphological agreement on the verb, on the other
hand. Compare the subject of the intransitive verb ʔêg ‘vomit’ in (11) with the subject
of the transitive verb hěmʔ ‘eat’ in (12) below. Note that in both cases the subject
argument is expressed by the pronoun kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ and it is indexed on the predicate
with the proclitic mi= ‘3SG.F’; the lack of morphological case marking and the
syntactic position of the subject noun phrase and the indexing on the verb seen in
the intransitive construction in (11) are the same as those in the transitive
construction in (12):11) kǎnʔ        mi=ʔêg=na=ka
    3SG.F        3SG.F=vomit=DECL=ASS
    ‘she is vomiting’12) kǎnʔ          tʃɨ ̌jʔ-daʔ,              niʔat=jǔb,

      3SG.F=eat-PST=REC.PST
      ‘she ate the manioc bread, everything reallyǃ’       As mentioned above, a clause in Kakua can be formed by a subject and a
predicate, or by a predicate with a subject proclitic (in addition to no expression of
subject at all, if recoverable from the context). Consider the following intransitive
clauses. In (13) the subject argument is fully expressed with a free pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’ as well as indexed on the verb with the cross-referencing proclitic ã=
‘3SG.M’, which agrees in person, number and gender with the subject NP kǎn.
                                                   Alignment and word order        309Compare this to the construction in (14), where the clause is formed by a single
predicate with the proclitic wã= ‘1SG’, indexing the subject argument of this
intransitive clause:13) kǎn        ʔã=ʔêw=na=ka
    3SG.M       3SG.M=sing=DECL=ASS
    ‘he is singing’14) wã=pĩ-ʔɨm=na=ka
    1SG=HAB-be.afraid=DECL=ASS
    ‘I’m always afraid’        Subject arguments can express the semantic roles of agents or experiencers.
Examples (15) and (16) show subject arguments of stative verbs in which the subject
arguments have the semantic role of ‘patient’, a prototypical semantic role of subjects
of stative verbs:15) wěm         wã=pĩ-hêjʔ-weʔe-kan=be
    1SG          1SG=HABT-know-NEG=REC.PST
    ‘I used to know’16) wěm        bɨ          wã=tʃù-fwɨʔɨ
    1sg         today       1SG=rest-TEL.PROG
    ‘I am, today, still resting’       Subjects of intransitive verbs of motion or active verbs prototypically have
the semantic role of agent. This is illustrated in example (17) below:17) kǎn       ʔã=t-fwɨ ̂b-ʔǎb-beh=na
    3SG.M      3SG.M=EVID-follow-go.up-go=DECL
    ‘he went back up again’       Finally, subjects of intransitive clauses involving verbs of mental or emotional
processes (or verbs of perception) prototypically have the semantic role of
experiencers. Examples (18)-(20) below give an illustration of these types of clauses
in Kakua:18) kǎnʔ        mi=pĩ-tîk=na=ka
    3SG.F        3SG.F=HAB-be.embarrassed=DECL=ASS
    ‘she is usually embarrassed’19) wěm        bɨdǐ           ̃̂

    ‘I was very sad/very sorry’

    night-other 3PL       3PL=EVID-be.surprised=INF.FUT.EVID=ASS
    ‘they might be surprised tomorrow’       Examples (12)-(20) above illustrate the expression of subject arguments in
intransitive clauses, showing that, although the subject noun phrase does not receive
morphological marking to indicate its grammatical function (i.e. no subject case
marker), the verb usually takes a cross-referencing proclitic encoding person and
number properties of the subject argument.
       The expression of subject arguments in transitive clauses is illustrated in
examples (21)-(22), which show that the subject arguments are morphologically and
syntactically expressed in the same way as the subject arguments in the intransitive
clauses presented in (11)-(20) above. In (21) the subject argument expressed by the
NP wã=ʔibi ‘my uncle’ is the instigator of the action expressed by the transitive
verb tɨh ‘kill with blowgun’ performed on an object argument with the semantic role
of patient, which is morphologically marked with the object case marker =diʔ:21) wã=ʔibi  wɨbɨ=diʔ           ʔã=t-tɨh=na=tagǎ
    1SG=uncle bird.sp=OBJ        3SG.M=EVID-kill.with.blowgun=DECL=INF.EVID      tʃãhãp
      PROG
      ‘my uncle must be hunting Curassow (bird.sp)’        Example (22) shows a similar type of clause, where the subject argument is
expressed both by the NP hiw ‘jaguar’, and indexed on the predicate with the
proclitic ‘3SG.M’, agreeing in person, number and gender with the subject argument:22) hiw       mɨhiw=diʔ               ʔã=t-tʃãk=na=wɨt=be
    jaguar dog=OBJ                    3SG.M=EVID-bite=DECL=REP.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘the jaguar bit the dog, it is said’        The syntactic position of subject arguments in intransitive and transitive
clauses is preferably sentence-initial (see above). Additional examples are given in
(23)-(24), displaying constructions involving verbs of perception or mental
processes. In (23) the subject is a lexical noun cross-referenced on the verb by the
proclitic ʔã= ‘3SG.M’. In (24) the subject argument is a pronoun and is also cross-
referenced on the verb:         S      O                           V

    ‘he loved his daughter’        Consider now example (25), in which the subject argument is not expressed
through an NP, but indexed on the predicate of the clause only. In this case the
resulting constituent order is O s=V. Example (26) further illustrates the same order,
where the noun wãp ‘white capuchin’ is the object of the verb fwãʔ ‘find’, and the
subject is expressed by the proclitic fwĩ= ‘1PL’:        O                                   s=V

    ‘we met the (evil spirit) white capuchin’
11.4 Object alignment
       Kakua marks its object arguments with the case marker enclitic =diʔ on the
object NP, i.e. a dependent-marking strategy, in terms of Nichols (1986). Unlike
subject arguments, object arguments are not indexed on the verb. Examples (27)-
(28) below illustrate object case marking:27) měm=be                       wěm=diʔ             ma=buʔé=na=be
    2SG=REC.PST                   1SG= OBJ             2SG=teach=DECL=REC.PST
    ‘you taught me’28) wěm         kǎn=diʔ                   wã=hěp-ʧàʔ-tɨb=na=ka
    1SG          3SG.M= OBJ                 1SG=be.jealous-be.on.top-hurt=DECL=ASS
    ‘I am jealous of him’       The object case marker clitic =diʔ serves to mark object arguments in several
different semantic roles.1 This is examplified in (29)-(32). (See further discussion on
semantic roles and object marking in Chapter 6). Example (29) shows an object
        1
            See the comment in Chapter 6 regarding the possibility that the object marker =diɁ might have
other functions than marking object arguments, as it also occurs on noun phrases expressing source/goal,
as well as on other NPs that are not core arguments.
312     A Grammar of Kakuaargument in experiencer role; the object NP in (30) has a recipient role; the object

    3SG.M       3SG.M=daughter= OBJ           3SG.M=care.about
    ‘he loves his daughter’       Kakua treats all object arguments in the same way, including when two or
more objects co-occur in di-transitive constructions, both in terms of the use of the
object case marker =diʔ and the differential object marking that applies to it.
       An example of a ditransitive construction is given in (33) below. This example
exhibits a typical ditransitive Kakua verb wɨʔ̃ ̌ ‘give’, exhibiting an agent-like subject
argument, and two objects, one of which is in a recipient (R) role, Gabí ‘Gabriel’,
and the other, dâwa-daʔ ‘ball-CL:round’ is in a theme (T) role. Two things are
important to note here. Firstly, note that all object arguments are marked with the
object case marker =diʔ. Secondly, note that all arguments occur before the verb:

    ‘Bone of Opossum gave Venom a wild pig yesterday in Mitú’       Despite the preferred SOV constituent order, the object NP may also precede
the subject NP. This often occurs when the object argument is being emphasized in
discourse, resulting in an OSV order:       O                S                    V

    ‘the monkey hits Marina’
11.2. Alignment
       The alignment system in Kakua conforms to the prototypical nominative-
accusative type, whereby the intransitive subject and the most agentive argument of
a transitive clause are expressed in the same way, but different from the least
agentive argument of a transitive clause: A=S≠O. Because intransitive subjects (S)
and the most agentive arguments of transitive clauses (A) are treated equally in
Kakua, I refer to both as ‘subjects’. Subject arguments are not morphologically
marked by case. Cross-referencing proclitics attach to the verb and agree in person
and number with the subject arguments of the clause. All other arguments (i.e.,
arguments functioning in any role different from subject) are morphologically
marked for case, if the requirements for differential object marking are met (see
Chapter 6). Alignment of object arguments is neutral, meaning that object arguments
308     A Grammar of Kakuain the semantic roles of patients, themes, and recipients are all encoded in the same
way: P=T=R (see Chapter 6).
        The morphological marking of arguments in Kakua shows both head and
dependent marking (in terms of Nichols 1986). While subject arguments are head-
marked (morphologically indexed on the predicate), object arguments are dependent-
marked by morphological case markers on the object NPs.
        The remainder of this chapter is divided into two parts. Section §11.3 focuses
specifically on the alignment of subjects, while section §11.4 describes the alignment
of objects. A summary is given in §11.5, listing the most relevant information
regarding alignment in Kakua.","[328, 329]"

locative case marker =bǔ and the object case marker =diʔ ‘OBJ’ (see Chapter 6).
Secondly, note that the adjunct precedes the verb. Additionally, note that the adjunct
occurs in between the two object arguments of the clause. This may be related to the
fact that there is no overt subject NP in this example. This example thus suggests
that Kakua prefers to place the adjunct preceding the verb, but not in clause-initial
position, adjuncts thus ending up in the second position within the clause. The
preferred ordering of constituents in clauses with adjuncts would then be as follows:
S[ADJUNCT]OV, or O[ADJUNCT]V, the second ordering being preferred whenever the
subject NP is absent.
       Examples (33)-(34) also show that all arguments functioning as objects are
marked by the morpheme =diʔ, regardless of their semantic roles. In other words,
object arguments in the semantic roles of patient (P), theme (T), goals/recipients (R),
are all encoded by the same morpheme. As described in Chapter 6, the order of
object noun phrases encoding T, P or R is also free. The alignment of object
arguments is thus neutral (as in Croft 2003; Haspelmath 2005; Dryer 2007;
Malchukov et. al 2010).","[333, 334]"

                                                  Introduction: Kakua and its speakers                3        The morphology of Kakua is highly agglutinative (especially in its verbal
morphology), with a combination of head and dependent marking. The language is
predominantly suffixing, with a few prefixes occurring exclusively on the verb.
Kakua has cross-referencing proclitics that agree in person and number with the
Subject/Agent argument of the clause. Third person singular referents have,
additionally, gender agreement of feminine or masculine. Roots are often
compounded to form new words.
        Parts of speech in Kakua can be divided into open classes (nouns and verbs),
and closed classes (adjectives, adverbs, numerals, interjections, and other particles).
          Kakua nominal categories include number, classifiers, diminutive and
augmentative distinctions, and case marking. Nominalization is a highly productive
strategy to derive nouns from verbs. Animacy is particularly relevant for the system
of differential object marking and differential number marking. There are no
prefixing positions in the noun template, unless additional derivational processes
have been applied (Chapter 4).
          Nouns can be further subdivided into alienable and inalienable classes, as
is evident from the system of possession marking (Chapter 5).
        Most of Kakua morphology occurs in the verbal construction. There, prefixes,
suffixes and enclitics encode all of the tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality (TAME)
distinctions (clitics conveying TAME distinctions can also occur on other word
classes). Likewise, valency changing morphemes, verbal negation, cross-referencing
proclitics, and many markers of discourse also occur in the verb construction. Verb
roots can group together in a very productive grammatical strategy of verb
serialization.
        Kakua’s most common constituent order is verb-final (S)OV, although other
orders are also allowed. It has a nominative-accusative alignment system.","[24, 25]"

         Imperative clauses in Kakua are formed by reduplication of the last vowel of
the verb root of the predicate of the imperative clause. The reduplicated vowel
receives an obligatory high tone. The imperative suffix is then by default represented
as -Ṽ́ , where the quality of the vowel is the same as that of the last vowel of the
verb root. This is illustrated in examples (90)-(105):90) ɲi=tɨ ̀j-huj-ú
    2PL=be.good-listen-IMP
    ‘listen carefully!’91) hemʔ-é
    eat-IMP
    ‘eat!’
336     A Grammar of Kakua92) wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-á=buhú
    1SG=OBJ tell-IMP=DIR
    ‘tell me’5       Like all Kakua clauses, imperative clauses in Kakua are typically verb-final.
Kakua often omits the overt expression of subject NP arguments (although their overt
expression is considered acceptable by speakers, they judge them to be redundant),
for they are usually referred to by means of cross-referencing proclitics on the verb
predicate. Imperative clauses in Kakua tend to omit the subject argument of the
clause more often than other clauses (a cross-linguistic common characteristic of
imperative clauses; c.f., Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171; Aikhenvald 2010:92-97, and
Chapter 2 of the same book). The omission of the subject argument of the clause
occurs more frequently with 2SG forms than with 2PL forms; however, this omission
can be said to be facultative, since instances of the 2PL where the subject argument
is omitted can also occur when context is sufficient to allow for it. The verb root
plus the imperative marker -Ṽ́, without need of further affixes or clitics, can function
as an imperative clause by itself (also a cross-linguistically common feature of
imperative clauses Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171). If additional TAME distinctions
occur, they form a separate clause. Imperative clauses without an overt proclitic are
interpreted by default as having a second person singular subject (93)-(94). Examples
(95) and (96) illustrate imperatives with overt 2PL and 2SG proclitic pronouns
respectively:93) fwɨb-ɨ ̃́
    return-IMP
    ‘come back!’94) ɲaw-á
    run-IMP
    ‘run!’95) ɲi=nêʔ-é                    tɨ ̀j-wẽp-ni
    2PL=press-IMP                 be.good-be.strong-ADJVZ
    ‘press strongly!’96) ma=tiw-í
    2SG=shot.with.blowgun=IMP
    ‘shoot!’
         5
             This example can also be analyzed as wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-ábuhú 1SG=OBJ tell-IMP2, where ‘IMP2’,
is an imperative concerning an action for the benefit of someone else. See the description of this
construction at the end of this section.
                                   Basic clause structure and types of clauses    337       Imperatives can also be used to give commands to other than a 2 nd person
(singular or plural) participants. This is done by adding the appropriate proclitic
pronoun in the imperative construction:97) mi=Ɂên-é
    3SG.F=see=IMP
    ‘may she see!’
98) mi=têw-é
    3SG.F=work=IMP
    ‘may she work!’        Constituent order in imperative clauses is somewhat different from that in
declarative clauses. Imperative clauses do have a verb final order. But if the subject
argument is fully expressed by an NP, then the subject argument most often
immediately precedes the verb. It then follows the object rather than preceding it as
in other clauses, with an OSV order as the result. The fronting of the object argument
in an imperative clause is not an uncommon cross-linguistic feature of imperatives
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97). This ordering of imperative clauses in Kakua is
illustrated in examples (99)-(101) below:99) kan=diʔ měm          ma= fwẽh-é
    3SG=OBJ 2SG           2SG=leave-IMP
    ‘leave it!’100) bab-ni=diʔ                    měm     ma=dúk-ú
     be.white-ADJVZ=OBJ            2SG      2SG=sift-IMP
   ‘sift the manioc drink!’101) wã=pebʔ           měm       ma=ɲɨʔ-hɨwʔ-ɨ ̃́
     1SG=be.near        2SG        2SG=stand-come-IMP
     ‘you come stand by me!’       The only evidentiality marker that can occur in combination with imperative
clauses in Kakua is the reported evidential =wɨt, possibly together with the prefix
t- ‘EVID’ (prefix of second hand, nonsensorial evidentiality. See Chapter 10 on
evidentiality) to express that the order has been given by someone other than the
speaker. The use of the reported evidential marker usually serves also to attenuate
the force of the command, making it a more polite imperative. This is often used
when directing orders to elders (102)-(103). Note that the additional evidentiality
specification forms a separate clause, so cannot be directly combined with the
imperative verb:

     ‘take (the manioc) out for grating, it is said’        In fact, imperative clauses in Kakua lack all TAME distinctions in the clause
itself, and all of these distinctions form a separate clause. Cross-linguistically
speaking, this is not an uncommon characteristic of imperative clauses (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985).
        An additional construction expressing imperative solicits the addressee to
perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The form of this imperative is
-áʔbuhú and it is glossed here as ‘IMP2’. In constructions using this morpheme, the
subject is always a second person, and its overt expression may be omitted. See
examples (104)-(105) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’. This
form can only code a ‘beneficial’ imperative, and no other benefactive or dative like
meanings can be drawn from it.104) ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ                nih-áʔbuhú
     take=DECL=ASS=D.S               say-IMP2
     ‘(she) is recording, (you) tell her!’105) kǎn=diʔ ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
     3SGM=OBJ take.out-IMP2
     ‘take (it) out for him’       Synchronically, -áʔbuhú is considered here to be one single morpheme.
However, because of the phonological (syllabic structure, vowel harmony) structure
of Kakua words, it is likely that that -áʔbuhú is historically at least a complex form.
The etymology of this imperative is not transparent.6
         6
          It might be a lexicalized combination of a morpheme -áʔ and the directional clitic=buh ‘DIR’.
The first element could be a phonologically reduced form of the negative suffix -kan, or it might
correspond to a morpheme that is no longer used in synchronic Kakua. Note that the negative suffix
doesn’t support a semantic motivation for this ‘beneficial’ imperative. Perhaps, the source of the proposed
first element -áɁ, expressed similar semantics of performing an action on behalf of a third party.
Nonetheless, there is no evidence neither in Kakua nor in its sister language Nɨkak that allows me to
strongly claim this hypothesis. The second element of this form would be the directional clitic =buh
‘DIR’, displaying the addition of a reduplicated vowel and high tone, i.e. the regular way to form
imperatives -Ṽ́. I propose the directional clitic as the most likely source of this element in this imperative
marker because of the semantics of this clitic, which comes from a verb root meaning ‘to perform an
action from a distance’ (see note at the end of Chapter 8 regarding the fuzzy verbal-directional identity
                                            Basic clause structure and types of clauses              33912.12 Negative imperative
       Negative imperative clauses require the negative imperative suffix -kabuhú.
This is also clearly a complex morpheme, historically derived from at least two
morphemes. The first part of this morpheme can be identified as the negative suffix
marker -kan/-kap. The second part, however, is less clear, and can have at least two
interpretations. Firstly, it may relate to the directional clitic =buh ‘DIR’, or to the
emphasis function of the clitic =bǔ ‘EMPH’ (see Chapter 8), plus a reduplication of
its vowel. As for now, I have no strong evidence for either of these hypotheses, but
what is clear is that (as with the second imperative described in §12.11 above), given
Kakua’s phonological and morphological rules, this particular negative imperative
morpheme can be considered historically as a complex form.
       The negative imperative morpheme must immediately follow the verb root
(to which no affirmative imperative can be attached): (PN)=Verb-kabuhú :106) ma=ʔɨm-kabuhú
     2SG=be.afraid-NEG.IMPER
     ‘don’t be afraid!’
of this morpheme). Thus, performing on behalf, or for the benefit of somebody else can be equated to
performing an action from a distance. Whenever the clause refers to this specific semantics of performing
an action for the benefit of somebody else, the imperative is expressed with this obscure morpheme
-áʔbuhú, thus it is considered here as one single complex morpheme. In constructions using this
morpheme, the subject argument of the clause is always in the second person, and it may be omitted. See
examples (i)-(ii) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’:
(i)         ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ                       nih-áʔbuhú
            take.out=DECL=ASS=D.S                  say-IMP2
            ‘(she) is recording, tell her!’
(ii)        kǎn=diʔ                ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
            3SGM=OBJ                take.out-IMP2
            ‘take (it) out for him’
Since it seems to have a beneficial encoding (perform for the benefit of someone else), the following
considerations might be relevant for a future study of this imperative: i) Kakua does not have a dedicated
marker for benefactive roles (see discussion in Chapter 6), ii) many Vaupés languages also do not have
dedicated markers for benefactive roles; iii) Kakua does not have a dative case marker (another possible
source for the development of a benefactive encoding of a form). If the source were a dative case marker,
however, it would be necessary to explain why and how a case marker becomes a verbal morpheme; iv)
many Vaupés languages have been described to lack a dative marker; v) Nɨkak, Kakua’s sister language,
has been described as making five case distinctions, among which a dative; vi) Kakua, as many of its
neighboring groups in the Vaupés, makes three morphological distinctions, for case: Object arguments,
Locatives, and Comitative and Instrumental; vii) Nɨkak’s dative marker is -éʔ (see Mahecha 2009); viii)
there is a regular sound correspondence of Nɨkak /e/ to Kakua /a/. This may be relevant for the complex
benefactive imperative form in Kakua -áʔbuhú; ix) because of Kakua’s phonological (syllabic structure,
vowel harmony) and morphological rules, we know that -áʔbuhú imperative is a complex form.

not contain TAME marking. If the reportative evidential is used, it does not attach
to the predicate together with the negative imperative, but it rather occurs forms
another clause (as in (107) above), and (110) below. The use of a reportative
construction seems to serve a function of making the command more ‘soft’, or more
polite:110) kět=diʔ             Katherine         ma=tû-kabuhú

      ‘Katherine, don’t push them! they have said’       As seen in (110) above, constituent order in negative imperatives clauses is
typically verb final; and whenever both the subject and object are overtly expressed
through a lexical noun or free pronoun, the order of subject and object is inverted
from the typical SOV basic order in Kakua, resulting in OSV (although speakers
accept other orders). The change of the preferred order into an OSV order is typical
for imperative clauses cross-linguistically (c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97).","[356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361]"
"        In the present section I explore the semantic and pragmatic properties of the
object argument conditioning DOM in Kakua, showing that object marking is
obligatory on noun phrases with human referents (and a few others). Other features
given by Creissels in the list above, such as formal properties of the noun phrase, or
semantic transitivity of verbal lexemes and their relation with obligatory marking
(c.f., Hopper & Thompson 1980:259, 272; von Heusinger & Niyazmetowa 2008),
are not considered here, but will need further study. Another factor favouring the
overt marking of object case appears to be word order, where OSV order tends to
favour the overt marking of case on the object argument (see Chapter 11, §11.1).
        The criteria conditioning DOM presented here for Kakua should be further
investigated in future research, and many questions remain unanswered for this
version of the description on the grammar of Kakua. Issues regarding topicality, for
example, and the interaction between definiteness and specificity, call for a detailed
study.
        This section is subdivided as follows: animacy and DOM in Kakua are
presented in §6.3.1-§6.3.6 while section §6.3.7 describes DOM and definiteness.
Other discourse related criteria that favours the overt marking of object case in
Kakua (namely definiteness) is given in §6.3.7 below. Future research should be
          3
              E.g., Comrie 1989, Bossong 1985, 1998, Croft 1998, Lazard 1994, 2001, 2003; Dalrymple &
Nikolaeva 2011, Iemmolo 2011.
192         A Grammar of Kakuafollowed in order to establish other possible correlations between DOM and other
areas of the grammar6.1.1       DOM and animacy
       The oligatoriness of object marker in Kakua responds to the animacy of the
noun phrase in object function. Object marking is obligatory on all noun phrases
with human referents. On other object noun phrases, object marking is obligatory if
the object noun phrase is higher on the animacy hierarchy than the subject noun
phrase. Otherwise, the overt marking of object case is optional, and may be favored
by definiteness.
       Object marking and its conditioning by animacy is a relatively common cross-
linguistic phenomenon and in fact seems to have been the most widely explored
conditioning feature for differential object marking across languages, c.f., Comrie
(1989) for references in a broader typological view of DOM; Bossong (1980, 1991,
1998) for Romance, Turkic, some Indo-European languages, and languages of
Australia; Blake (2001) for some aspects of DOM in Hindi; England (1996) for
Mayan languages; for languages of the Vaupés see Aikhenvald (2003, 2012); Zúñiga
(2007), and Epps (2008); Comrie (2008) makes reference to alignment of case
marking in a typological perspective; Campbell & Grondona (2012) for languages
of the Chaco and the southern cone; and O’Connor & Muysken (2014) and Birchall
(2014) for an overview of languages of South America.
       From these studies, we know that the higher the animacy of the object noun
within the hierarchy, the more likely it is that its marking will be obligatory. The
hierarchy governing this is reproduced below from Silverstein 1976 (see also Comrie
1989, and Croft 1991 for more discussion on animacy hierarchies):4                            1 > 2 > 3 > Human > Animate > Inanimate      The rationale behind this is that entities lower on the animacy hierarchy are
very likely to be patients and thus objects therefore do not need to be overtly marked
as such. For instance, nouns referring to human entities are typically agents, whereas
inanimate nouns are typically patients. This disambiguates between agents and
patients in many cases. However, ambiguity can occur when two (or more)
arguments within a clause have potentially the same animacy and thus the possibility
to be agents, e.g. when the object argument has a human referent. This is the reason
why nouns referring to humans when functioning as the object(s) argument(s) of the
clause are obligatorily marked, also in Kakua.
        DOM in Kakua conforms to this animacy hierarchy. All noun phrases with
human referents, including pronouns and demonstratives with human referents, are
obligatorily marked when in object function (demonstratives are obligatorily marked
also for a different reason, namely because they are definite, a pragmatic criterion
that favours the overt marking of object case; see §6.3.7 below). Nouns referring to        4
            Comrie (1989) notes also that pronouns do not really relate to animacy, but to referentiality.
                                         Argument marking and case marking 193a particular small set of animals are also very often (although not obligatorily)
marked, and this is determined by the animacy associated with them in Kakua’s
cultural and mythological conception. Most other animal terms and animate entities
in general are far less often marked (optionally marked). All inanimate terms are
also optionally marked (and may be marked depending on definiteness, topicality, or
disambiguation from other inanimate argument within the clause, see the description
in §6.3.7 below).
       Kakua thus has a cut-off point between obligatory and optional object
marking on the animacy scale between humans and mythological beings, on one side
(including PNs with reference to these), and other animates, and inanimates on the
other side, as summarized in the following figure.","[213, 214, 215]"

both. Also, it is used to refer to something that has already been mentioned in the

proximate demonstrative can be translated as English ‘here’ or ‘there’:46) kan=jǔb=pûʔba

hearer, or both. This distal demonstrative is usually also accompanied by a pointing
gesture towards the distant referent. The referent can be either visible or not visible
to speaker and hearer. An example is given below:

immediately proximate to the speaker or hearer. It is also used to refer to the last
element/participant previously mentioned in the discourse, like the latter in English.
Constructions involving the emphatic proximate often imply that the object is within
reachable distance, e.g. this very bark right here. The emphatic proximate

       Numerals are built up by compounding noun roots (or adjectivized or
nominalized verb roots), plus additional noun morphology such as case marking,
number marking, and classifiers, among others. The numerals 5 and above involve
a generative system consisting of adding terms for fingers and hands to the basic 1-
5 forms.
       The Kakua numeral system has native forms to express numerals from 1 to
20. Although Kakua speakers have reported that this numeral system can be extended
to count for higher numbers than 20, by adding terms of body parts of other
individuals (‘two hands and two feet and one hand from another person’), in actual
practice any quantity beyond five is expressed by using Spanish loans.
       A list of the Kakua cardinal numbers 1-5 is given in Table 3.10 below. A
comprehensive list of all 20 cardinal numbers in Kakua and a detail description of
the numeral system is given in Chapter 7.

                                 ‘with one hand’       In addition to numerals, Kakua has other morphemes that express quantity.
These are: tâwʔ ‘sometimes’, niʔat ‘all/every’, lâ ‘times/era’, dawǎ ‘many’, and henaʔ
‘this much/count/measure’.
         These quantifier-like terms can act as modifiers within noun phrases, or can
occur by themselves as the head of the noun phrase. Examples of these morphemes
are given below:51) kan=na                   ʔĩ=t-ʔɨn-ɨp=ta=be                           hû=diʔ

3.3.5 Adjectives
      Adjectives are cross-linguistically defined as a class of words that modify
nouns and that are used for denoting qualities or attributes (c.f., Dixon 2004:1-49,
Schachter and Shopen 2007).
116     A Grammar of Kakua        In Kakua, most attributive or quality meanings are expressed through
descriptive verbs. A small set of words which are not verbs and can be used directly
in attributive modification, however, can be identified.
        The small set of adjectives in Kakua is formed by a total of four adjectives.
Morphologically, these words can take both verb and noun morphology.
Syntactically, the adjective words have a fairly free order and the modifier can occur
either preceding or following the modified noun.
        The adjectives have a likely etymology in verbs, as discussed at the end of
this section. The four Kakua adjectives are given in (53) belowː53) hàp         ‘tall/up’
      hâp       ‘new’
      bɨdǐ      ‘big’
      jehěp     ‘bad’       All other qualities or attributive meanings in the language are expressed by
descriptive verbs. When a descriptive verb is used for expressing an attribute or
quality, the verb root is marked with the adjectivizer morpheme –ni following the
modified noun in juxtaposition.
       The class of adjectives is distinct from verbs and nouns. Unlike verbs,
adjectives can occur as free morphemes without the need of derivational morphology
to function as modifiers of nouns. Unlike nouns, adjectives can take all of the verbal
morphology, and may function as heads of verb phrases.
       The syntactic position of the four adjective words in Kakua is apparently not
fixed, and whereas some speakers prefer an N Adj order, others have no clear
preference for either one, accepting both as being just as good. It must be said,
however, that allowing for either order to occur is much more common in elicitations
than in natural texts, where the modifier tends to follow the modified noun. This
might be explained in that the four adjectives in Kakua have an etymological source
in verbs, and Kakua is predominantly a verb-final language.
       The examples in (54) and (55) below illustrates a case in which the same
speaker uses indistinctly both Adj N and N Adj orders in the same narrative text:54) bɨdǐ        keh
    big          fish
    ‘big fish’55) jòaʔ       bɨdǐ
    backyard big
    ‘big backyard’
                                                Types of morphemes and word classes                  117       The adjectives in Kakua can take nominal morphology as in (56) and be the
head of noun phrases without having to take any word-class changing morphology.as
in (57) and (58):456) měm         hàp=bǔ=ka                 ʔinwɨʔá
    2SG          up=LOC=ASS                  relative

    big-CL:round=OBJ see=SS                             2SG=choose-IMP
    ‘look and choose the big oneǃ’58) beh           kǎn        mi=t-beh=na=wɨt=hĩ                                       hâp-wili

         3PL=COM
         ‘he and the young woman went with them’       When descriptive verbs function as attributive modifiers, they are adjectivized
by the adjectivizer suffix –ni.
       The following examples in (59) and (60) below illustrate this adjectival
function of descriptive verbs. Note also the order of constituents where the predicate
remains in final position whereas the adjectivized verb precedes the verb phrase.59) ʔên-é      hěa      dɨpɨ ̌-ni                    ʔã=hɨm=na=ka
    see-IMPER sky          be.dark-ADJVZ                3SG=exist=DECL=ASS
    ‘lookǃ the sky is dark’60) wěm                 hodaʔ-na=diʔ                   bǎb-mâʔ-ni
    1SG                  banana-INAN.PL=OBJ             be.ripe-to.age-ADJVZ         wã=hěmɁ-ep=be
         1SG=eat-PST=REC.PST
         ‘I ate the ripe bananas'       This suffix –ni is polysemous. It can also encode agent nominalization when
suffixed to other non-descriptive verbs (verbs of actions, states). This suffix is
          4
              Although from examples (57) and (58) it seems that the classifier can have a nominalizing
function (i.e., acting as derivational morphology), which is a common function of classifiers in many
regional languages (see also nominalization via compounding of classifiers to verbs described in chapter
4), these adjectives can also occur as head of a NP without the classifiers, as can be seen in example (4)
above.

‘A.NMLZ’ when its function is agent nominalization.5 Examples of its function as
agent nominalizer are given below. A further description of agent nominalization is

    carry.on.shoulders-A.NMLZ
    ‘the carrier’62) kûʔu-ni
    give.medicine/heal-A.NMLZ
    ‘doctor/healer’       Like verbs, all of the members of the adjective classes in Kakua can take the
adjectivizer/nominalizer suffix –ni:63) hàp-ni

    ‘the tall one’64) hâp-ni
    new-A.NMLZ
    ‘newly/young one’65) jehěp-ni
    bad- A.NMLZ
    ‘ugly one’       Attributive meanings such as taller vs. tallest in Kakua are expressed by
comparative constructions involving the verb ʧaʔ ‘be on top’. Examples are given
below. Comparative constructions may also be expressed by the juxtaposition of the
compared elements. Comparative constructions and their attributive meanings are
described in Chapter 13.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140]"

the order of verbal morphemes when moving from left to right in the verb word.
Those morphemes presented as occurring in the same slot are mutually exclusive,
but also some that are presented in different slots cannot co-occur because of
semantic incompatibility. For instance, of the evidentiality enclitics from slot 12,
only the reported evidential =wɨt can co-occur with the declarative mood marker
from slot 11 (see §16.8 and Chapter 13). Another such restriction is that evidentiality
enclitics from slot 12 cannot co-occur with the assertion marker from slot 14.

idealized versions of what the verb word would look like. The forms presented in

them can actually co-occur in a verb word.","[264, 265]"

11.5 Summary
        The word order and alignment of arguments in Kakua can be summarized as
follows:
 Kakua shows a strong preference for the SOV ordering of its constituents.
     Alternative orders follow a preferentiality scale, from most preferred SOV to
     least preferred (but attested with restrictions) VOS.
 Most preferred orders are verb-final, with objects preceding the verb.
 The coding of subject arguments is of the head-marking type.
 Subject arguments are not morphologically marked for case.
 Kakua A arguments and S arguments are not different morphosyntactically. This
     conforms to a typical nominative-accusative type of alignment, where A and S
     arguments are equal, while different from P arguments: A=S≠P.
314    A Grammar of Kakua     The marking of object arguments is of the dependent-marking type. Nouns or
      NPs functioning as object arguments are marked by case with the case marker
      =diʔ.
     Differential Object Marking (DOM) criteria govern the overtness of
      morphological marking of object arguments.
     The object case marker =diʔ serves to mark NPs functioning as object
      arguments in several different semantic roles.
     The alignment of object arguments corresponds to a neutral type of object
      alignment, where P=T=R.

          Basic clause structure and types of clauses
12.0   Introduction
       This chapter describes the basic clause structure and the different clause types
in Kakua. Section §12.1 provides an introductory overview of the minimal
requirements to form a clause. Section §12.2 gives a description of copular
constructions involving predicative and existential copulas. In addition to affirmative
existential copulas, Kakua also has a negative existential copula; this type of negative
existential is described in §12.3. Section §12.4 gives a description of predicative
possession. This is followed by a description of comparative constructions in §12.5,
and non-verbal predicates expressing equation in §12.6. Finally, §12.7 provides a
description of the basic locative constructions.
       This chapter concludes with a description of Kakua clause types, presented in
4 subsections: declarative clauses in §12.9; interrogative clauses, both polar and
content interrogatives, in §12.10; imperative clauses in §12.11; and negative
imperative clauses in §12.12. Responses to imperative clauses are described in
§12.13, and a summary is found in §12.14.
12.1   Minimal clause
        A basic sentence in Kakua is composed of at least one independent clause.
An intransitive clause is minimally composed of a predicate (with optional
indexation of the subject by means of a cross-referencing proclitic), as in (1); or an
optional subject NP and a predicate, as in (2), where the subject NP typically
precedes the predicate (SV). Transitive clauses minimally contain a predicate;
additionally, transitive clauses typically contain an overt object NP (though not
obligatorily); the subject NP is optional, and it may be indexed on the predicate by
means of cross-referencing proclitics (3), which are themselves also optional (see
Chapter 11 for description of criteria governing the occurrence of proclitics). In
transitive clauses, the object NP typically precedes the predicate of the clause (SOV)
(4)-(6).                   ̃̌ ʔ=hĩ

12.2     The affirmative existential copular verb hɨm
        The affirmative existential verb hɨm is used in predicative and existential
copular constructions to encode existence, and also permanent states and attribution,
as discussed in this section. Equative constructions in Kakua use a different strategy,
and are formed by the juxtaposition of the NPs without the use of the existential verb
hɨm (see §12.6 below). Note that the verb hɨm ‘exist’, which is referred to as a copula
here, can function as a predicate on its own, whereas the canonical definition of
copulas expects copulas to not be able to function as predicates on their own right;
see Hengeveld (1992). Examples below illustrate copula constructions in Kakua,
using the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ in its different functions to express permanent
states, existence/location, and attribution:7) jeděʔ-wã    jěb    hɨm=nit

    ‘Hamu is very sadǃ       The basic structure of predicative and existential copular constructions in
Kakua does not differ from that shown for other types of verbal constructions
(intransitive, monotransitive, ditransitive), in which the verb is (preferably) in final
position, being preceded by the object and the subject/agent arguments: SOV( cop).
Thus, a copular construction is also preferably of the type SOV. The copular verb in
Kakua takes all of the verbal morphology (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of verbal
morphology). This include interrogative mood (14) and tense and aspect (14)-(17)
(see also the examples above in this section), cross-referencing proclitics,
morphemes indicating evidentiality, as in (16), and nominalizers, as in (17):

318      A Grammar of Kakua12.3     The negative existential verb wîʔikan
        In addition to the affirmative existential copular verb hɨm, Kakua has an
inherently negative stative verb wîʔikan denoting the meanings of ‘not to have or not
to exist’. This form can be further analyzed into two morphemes, a verb root wîʔi-
and the verbal negation suffix –kan. However, the root wîʔi- is obligatorily bound
and cannot occur without the negation suffix –kan, and this verb is thus considered
to be a single negative existential expression. The negative existential verb, like other
Kakua verbs, takes all the verbal morphology available to verbs in general: cross-
referencing proclitics (18); TAM affixes (18)-(20), evidentiality prefixes and/or
enclitics (as in (18)-(20)), and derivational suffixes to form adjectives (21):18) hiw=bɨt                  ʔã=t-wîʔikan=na

    ‘he is blind’(lit. ‘there is no eye’)       Additionally, it can form an utterance on its own, and is often sufficient as a
negative response to a question (of the English type ‘no’) as exemplified below:22) Q. ʔã=t-ʔên=nit                ʔã=t-bìdi=nit=hĩ

       ‘did he look? did he search?’       A wîʔikan
         ‘no’       Although the affirmative existential verb hɨm can also be negated by attaching
the negation suffix -kan to it, Kakua speakers strongly prefer using the negative
existential wîʔikan, when the predicative or existential clause is negative. Negating

12.13 Responding to imperatives
        Responses to imperative clauses are constructed like responses to questions
(described in §12.10 above under interrogative polar and content questions).
Commands are usually responded to with the particle (interjection) hɨhɨ  ̃̂ ‘yes’, or
another particle with affirmative meaning (see Chapter 3 for a list of particles and
interjections in Kakua), such as da! ‘thereǃ’, among others. Additionally (as with
questions), imperatives can be responded to by repeating the predicate of the
imperative clause in a declarative construction. Example in (111) below illustrates a
response to a command:

        right.now
        ‘yes, alright, I will tell (it to) Armadillo right now’      Negative responses to a command are also constructed like negative responses
to questions. A negative response may involve repeating the predicate in the
imperative clause, adding the negation marker -kan as illustrated in (112):112) A: beh-é
        go-IMP
        ‘goǃ’     B. wã=beh-kan=tʃãhãp

        ‘I am not going’
12.14 Summary
        This chapter describes the basic clause structure in Kakua. A minimal clause
contains at least one predicate. Given that cross-referencing proclitics can stand for
the subject NP of the clause, the overt expression of the subject NP is not obligatory
in order to form a clause. In basic clauses involving predicates with semantically
transitive verb roots, the object argument NP generally precedes the predicate of the
clause. Most other clause types also prefer the basic SOV order of constituents. An
exception to this is the imperative clause, which prefers an OSV order.
        The basic clause structures of copula constructions (affirmative and negative
copular clauses), predicative possessive clauses, comparatives, verbless clauses, and
basic locative clauses were described in sections §12.2 to §12.7 respectively. It was
also shown that nonverbal clauses represent a common strategy in Kakua to express
equative copular meanings.
        This chapter ended with a description of the structure and coding of
declarative, interrogative and imperative (both affirmative and negative) clauses in
§12.10 and §12.11. Kakua declarative clauses represent the default type of clause.
        Additionally, there is a morpheme which expresses an imperative mood for
when the request is to perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The origin
of this morpheme is obscure, and a diachronic explanation is still to be found in
order to have a more accurate approach to analyze the form. Future research,
342   A Grammar of Kakuaincluding perhaps a comparative analysis between Kakua, Nɨkak and other
neighboring languages, will undoubtedly presents us with fascinating hypotheses on
the origin of this form.

13.0 Introduction
       This chapter describes the different mechanisms for combining clauses in
Kakua. This complements chapter 9 where verb serialization was introduced as one
strategy that Kakua has to express a series of events when these events have an
integrated relationship among themselves. In addition to serialization, Kakua has two
other strategies to relate events to one another: coordination and subordination.
          i)       Coordination: the symmetrical relation of events, or events that are
conceptually less integrated.
          ii)      Subordination: an asymmetrical relation of events (clauses) in
which one depends, grammatically and semantically, on a higher clause, i.e.
subordination. Subordination is a strategy that falls in between the expression of
events that are considered as more conceptually integrated (verb serialization) and
events that are less conceptually integrated (coordination).
       Section §13.1 provides a description of the two main strategies of
coordination in Kakua: i) simple juxtaposition of the coordinated clauses; or ii) use
of a coordinator particle. 1 The specific properties of each subtype of subordinate
clauses (complement, relative, and adverbial) are described in §13.2-§13.5.","[361, 362, 363, 364]"

         23 Barnes (1999:210) observes that most of the East Tukanoan languages have no coda.
Moreover, in those languages said to have a coda, this is always a glottal stop, but the status of the glottal
stop has been analyzed differently by different authors. See Stenzel (2007) for discussion of the glottal in
Wanano.

             Types of morphemes and word classes
3.0    Introduction
        This chapter presents an overview of the major word classes in Kakua. These
are divided into open classes and closed classes of words. The defining grammatical
features of these word classes are established by syntactic, semantic, and
morphological criteria. The word classes in Kakua include nouns, verbs, a small set
of adjectives, a small group of adverbs, a group of particles, and a large number of
grammatical, bound morphemes.
        The intricateness of Kakua’s grammar is due, for the most part, to its
morphological complexity. Kakua morphology is highly affixing; most affixes are
post-stem (suffixes), as is characteristic of the languages spoken in the Vaupés
linguistic area (c.f., Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999, Payne 1990, Aikhenvald 2002b,
2012). Prefixing occurs in the verb phrase only and the number of prefixes in Kakua
is far less than that of suffixes (see Chapter 8). Compounding in Kakua occurs very
productively as a strategy of derivation, possession, or as a strategy to form new
(lexical) meanings.
        The verb morphology in Kakua is by far more complex than the morphology
of nouns, regarding both inflection and derivation (cf., Chapter 8). A detailed
discussion of inflection and word class-changing derivational processes related to a
specific part of speech can be found in later chapters where for each part a thorough
description is given.
        Kakua syntax, on the other hand, is more simple and straightforward. The
preferred order is SOV, although alternative orders are often allowed (see Chapter
12).
        The word in Kakua consists of roots (at least one is obligatory) plus other
optional elements such as prefixes, a large number of derivational and inflectional
suffixes, and other formatives, such as clitics. Some discourse-related morphemes,
namely particles serving as intensifiers, or adverbial particles, also cliticize to
preceding hosts. For an overview of the definition of the Kakua word see Section
§3.1 below.
        The first aim of the present chapter is to offer an overview of the main types
of morphemes of Kakua. Note that this chapter provides only a basic description of
the main concepts that help define Kakua’s parts of speech and different
morphological categories. Secondly, this chapter describes Kakua’s open and closed
word classes. Open and closed word classes in Kakua differ in that open word classes
admit new items, whereas the closed classes, on the other hand, strongly resist the
introduction of new items.
96    A Grammar of Kakua        An overview of the types of morphemes and a description of how affixes and
clitics can be differentiated in Kakua is given in section §3.1.
        The semantic, syntactic, and morphological characteristics of the open classes
of words in Kakua are presented in §3.2. Section §3.3 provides a description of the
semantic, syntactic and morphological characteristics of the closed classes of words.","[115, 116, 117, 118]"
"8.1    Defining the verb in Kakua
       As opposed to the morphology of nouns (see Chapter 4), the verb morphology
in Kakua is very complex. With only very few exceptions, verb roots cannot occur
as bare roots when functioning as main clause predicates. Verb roots must always
be inflected for person, number (and gender for 3SG) with a procliticized cross-
referencing pronoun, and/or be specified for mood (see section §8.3 below).
236        A Grammar of Kakua       Phonologically, the characteristics of verb roots are not unique to the class of
verbs (see the description of the defining characteristics of the different parts of
speech in Chapter 3). Verb roots, as roots in the language as a whole, must be
minimally monosyllabic, and maximally bisyllabic. Roots bear lexical tone, and all
of Kakua’s tonal inventory is exhibited in verb roots (as shown in 1 below):1) jùj            ‘have diarrea’
    jûj           ‘massage while praying’
    jǔj           ‘be dripping’     Although a verb word may be composed of several roots (see Chapter 9 for verb
compounding and serialization), and these roots may present different tonal values,
the verb word as a whole has a characteristic intonation, with a high pitch at the
beginning of the word that gradually falls towards the end of the word. Thus, if a
verb word is composed of more than one root, the highest tone pitch for the second
root is invariably lower than the highest tone pitch of the first root (this is discussed
in detail in Chapter 2 on Kakua phonology regarding downdrift).
     Verb roots are also lexically specified for nasality or orality, as another general
characteristic of Kakua roots that is not unique to verb roots. As briefly introduced
in Chapter 2, verbs are distinguished from nouns primarily on semantic and
morphosyntactic grounds, rather than phonological (see the overview in Chapter 2
on the parts of speech and their basic characteristics).
        Semantically, verbs roots refer to actions (e.g., ʧaǩ̃ ‘bite’), processes (e.g.,
mǒp ‘to rot’), and temporal or permanent states (e.g., paʔ ‘be.like’; hěp ‘be.jealous’).
In other words, Kakua verbs prototypically express relations that are anchored in
time, processes or actions, or more general atemporal states of being such as dɨ ̀ ‘be
red’, nɨmʔ ‘be below’, etc. States denoting inherent or temporal properties are usually
expressed by descriptive verbs. The verb word may function as the predicate of the
clause.
        Related to its characteristic of being a heavily agglutinative language, Kakua
verb roots tend to encode only one relatively simple meaning each, while complex
meanings are created by combining various verb roots (see discussion in §8.3 below
for each of these verbal morphemes).
        Syntactically, the predicate tends to be the last constituent of the clause
(SOV). It is, thus, easy to recognize the verb word within a clause: it is the
morphologically most complex word, and the one that normally occurs in the last
syntactic position of the clause. The verb word by itself can also be sufficient both
as the predicate and as the only constituent of the clause, as is further discussed in
Chapter 11 on clause structure. Two examples are given in (2) and (3) below.
Example (2) illustrates the predicate occurring in its most typical final position.
Example (3) illustrates the predicate as sufficient to function as a clause in itself:

      3PL=HAB-escape-enter.into.a.smaller.area-put.together-go=DECL
      ‘they escaped into the forest going together’8.2      Transitivity and verb root classes
        This subsection describes the different semantic subclasses of verb roots. This
section will first address the semantics of verbs with regard to transitivity; after these
transitivity distinctions have been addressed, this section will describe the different
types of verbs with regard to other semantic features, specifically the semantic
subclasses of verbs, such as descriptive, stative, positional, and motion verbs. Other
verbal constructions and their semantics, such as verb serialization and
compounding, are dealt with in Chapter 9.
        With regard to transitivity, verb roots can be identified as being inherently
intransitive or transitive (mono- or ditransitive) verbs, judging by the number of
arguments that they can take. This distinction, however, is not very straightforward
and the lexical transitivity of verb roots is often difficult to establish. This is because
arguments do not have to be overtly expressed whenever these arguments have been
previously mentioned in the discourse. This applies particularly to the overt
expression of object arguments. Subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb,
and only with restricted exceptions these are not overtly expressed. The rules
governing the optionality of cross-referencing subject proclitics are discussed in
Chapter 6.
        Example (4) below illustrates this problematic classification of verbs roots
according to their lexical valency. The example is extracted from a conversation in
Kakua, shows a semantically transitive verb bɨ ́dʔ-tû ‘add.onto-hold.vertically’, where
the object argument is not expressed. However, since the argument to which the verb
is referring had been previously stated, the sentence is perfectly grammatical in
Kakua discourse:4) bɨ ́dʔ-tû=ka=nit
   add.onto-hold.vertically=ASS=S.S      ʔã=t-hɨjbi-ɲɨʔ-ɨp=wɨt=hĩ
      3SG.M=EVID-arrive.here-stop-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
      ‘he arrived and stopped, and held (the panflute) vertically (against his body)’
238    A Grammar of Kakua       The use of another semantically transitive verb with and without an overt
object noun phrase is illustrated in (5)-(6).","[257, 258, 259, 260]"
"
13.5 Complement clauses        A complement clause is commonly defined as a clause that functions as a core
argument of the predicate of the main clause (c.f., Givón 2001:39, Dixon 2006:15-
40, Noonan 1985:46, 2007: 52). Predicates that can take a complement clause,
instead of an NP, as their argument, are commonly verbs that encode meanings of,
e.g., say, believe, wish, know, see, hear, tell (Noonan 2007). These type of predicates
                                                              Complex Clauses      359are commonly called ‘complement-taking predicates’ or ‘CTPs’ (e.g. by Noonan
2007:53).
        In Kakua, common CTPs are verbs like nih ‘say’, nǎwɁ ‘tell’, and hêjɁnahǔj
‘think/believe’ (from hêjɁ ‘know’ and hǔj ‘listen/understand’). Complement clauses
in Kakua do not take special subordinating morphology (i.e., a complementizer
particle). Syntactically, complement clauses are most typically embedded within the
main clause:30) fǐt [Iginio tew-bǔpʧew-ni=na=ka]                         fĩ=niɁ
    1PL Iginio work-have.flu-ADJVZ=DECL=ASS                    1PL=not.know    hêjɁnahǔj-kan=be
    think-NEG=REC.PST
    ‘we didn’t think [that Iginio was sick]’ (with dengue)       Although the complement clause tends to be embedded within the main
clause, alternative orders can also be found. Consider example (31), referring to a
child who is in her crawling stage, perhaps about to walk. In (31) the complement
clause occurs following the main clause. The alternative order in (32) is also accepted
by speakers.31) kǎnɁ mi=nih-hêjɁnahǔj=na
    3SG.F 3SG.F=say-think=DECL    [ʧejbit                mi=japʧi-hej-bip=na=ka]
    tomorrow               3SG.F=walk-know-FUT=DECL=ASS
    ‘she says that she thinks [that she will know how to walk tomorrow]’32) [ʧejbit  mi=japʧi-hej-bip=na=ka]                           kǎnɁ
    tomorrow 3SG.F=walk-know-FUT=DECL=ASS                      3SG.F    mi=nih-hêjɁnahǔj=na
    3SG.F=say-think=DECL
    ‘she says that she thinks [that she will know how to walk tomorrow]’       Example (33) below also shows a case in which the complement clause
follows the main clause:33) wã=hêjɁ-kan=ka              [dedpaɁ=ka          Ɂĩ=ʧãh-ãp=tagǎ]
    1SG=know-NEG=ASS              WHAT=ASS            3PL=do-PST=INF.EVID
    ‘I don’t know [what they did]’      Alternatively, the example shown above can also be analyzed as a
combination of two main clauses (e.g., ‘I don’t know, what did they do?’).
360 A Grammar of Kakua      The conditions allowing for these alternate orders have not yet been explored
and await future research.
13.6 Relative Clauses        Relative clauses are clauses that modify an NP of the main clause (c.f.,
Keenan 1985, Van Valin 2005:183-224). In Kakua, relative clauses differ from
complement clauses in that they are marked with the relativizer suffix –ni/-nit12 (here
glossed as SUBR ‘subordinator’) that attaches to the predicate of the relative clause.
The relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. 13 When the relative clause is
modifying the object argument of the main clause, the object marker may also occur
on the relative clause (e.g. (35) below). The relativized noun phrase can be the
subject, or object (as in (35)-(36) below) within the relative clause. There is no
relative pronoun in Kakua, and as the examples below show, the subordinator suffix
marks the predicate of the relative clause:34) [fin               têw-ni]              newě     Ɂã=wɨn-at
    yesterday          work-SUBR             man       3SG.M=die-NMLZ     Ɂã=beh-ep=be
     3SG.M=go-PST=REC.PST
     ‘the man [who worked yesterday] died’ (the man who worked yesterday went
     to his death)35) [ʧɨ ̂=diɁ                     hěmɁ-ni]=diɁ        ɲɨj=diɁ
    pineapple=OBJ                 eat-SUBR=OBJ         opossum=OBJ     Ɂĩ=mâw-ap=be
     3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
     ‘they killed the opossum [that ate the pineapple]’        12
             Note the (near) homophony of this morpheme with other functional morphemes in Kakua: the
interrogative clitic =nit ‘INTERR’ (Chapter 8), agent nominalizer suffix -ni ‘A.NMLZ’ (Chapter 4),
collective plural -nit ‘PL’ (Chapter 4), and same subject clitic =nit ‘S.S’ (Chapter 8 and section §13.3
above). The homophony of morphemes in Kakua has been seen also for other morphemes (e.g., declarative
=na, inanimate plural number -na; emphatic =bǔ and locative =bǔ). The extent to which all of the
-ni/=nit forms might have a historic relation hasn’t been explored yet. Finally, the variants -ni ~ -nit as
complementizer suffixes seem to have free variation even within one and the same speaker. Since I did
not test for a context in which one form would be preferred over the other, a more systematic study should
be undertaken in future research on Kakua.
        13
             According to Dryer (2013), relative clauses preceding the noun are rather uncommon outside
of Asia. He also points out that typologically languages in which the relative clause precedes the noun are
also verb-final languages, which is true for Kakua.
                                                               Complex Clauses      36136) [mɨhiw ɲɨn-ni]=diɁ            mɨɁ=diɁ         Ɂĩ=mâw-ap=be
    dog       chase-SUBR=OBJ agouti=OBJ           3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
    ‘they killed the agouti [whom the dog chased]37) [katerine     ɲɨj=diɁ           ʧɨ ̂=diɁ          mi=wɨɁ-ni]=diɁ
    Katherine     opossum=OBJ       pineapple=OBJ 3SG.F=give-SUBR=OBJ    Ɂĩ=mâw-ap=be
    3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
    ‘they killed [the opossum to whom Katherine had given pineapple]’        Examples (35)-(37) above raise various interesting questions. One concerns
the marking of object case on both the relative clause and the head noun. Probably
this marking on both elements is a formal distinction that, in addition to the use of
the subordinator marker -ni ~ -nit, helps to identify relatives clauses from other types
of subordinate clauses. Or maybe the marking of object case on both the relative
clause and the head noun can be interpreted as an apposition of a headless relative
clause and the noun to which it refers (headless relative + head N. See examples of
headless relative clauses below).
        Another interesting construction of relative clauses is that shown in example
(37). This is an internally headed relative clause, which illustrates yet another
strategy of relative clause formation. Kakua can thus be said to have externally
headed relative clauses, internally headed relative clauses, headless relative clauses,
and (maybe) the apposition of the relative clause and the head noun.
        Future research on these different subordinating constructions will
undoubtedly provide us with very enriching typological information of subordination
strategies in the languages of the area.
        Kakua frequently uses headless relative clauses. Thus, the subordinate clause
occurs on its own and, as other relative clauses, usually precedes the predicate of the
main clause. Examples of headless relative clauses are given below. Note that
perhaps because of the lack of a head NP, in this type of headless relative clauses,
the subordinate clause seems to also be able to function as an argument of the main
clause (to function as a complement clause). Headless relative clauses are, by
definition, arguments of the main clause; thus, finding a formal difference between
headless relative and complement clauses can help to set these constructions apart in
Kakua. Possibly, a formal difference is the presence of the subordinator particle -ni
~ -nit ‘SUBR’. This formal distinction will help to describe examples like the ones in
(39)-(41) below, but does not account for the headless relative in (38) which lacks
the subordinator suffix. A rigorous evaluation of the different types of subordinate
clauses and their strict formal distinctions awaits further research:

have not provided a description of arguments that may or may not be relativized

other within the relative clause).

12.4     Predicative possession constructions
       Kakua has two main strategies to express possession. Firstly, the juxtaposition
of the possessor and the possessed NPs, with the possessive marker -ǐʔ suffixed to
the possessor NP for alienable possession, and without the possessive marker for
inalienable possession (see Chapter 5). Secondly, possession can be expressed by
means of a predicative construction (i.e. predicative possession). Predicative
possessive constructions involve the stative possessive verb bibùʔ ‘have/possess’.
The constituent order in predicative possessive constructions is consistent with
Kakua’s preferred SOV order. Thus, the possessor, most often animate, precedes the
possessed NP (usually inanimate), and the verb is at the end of the construction.
Constructions using this verb are illustrated in examples (23)-(26) below:23) badʔdaʔ         telu-ʧaʔ                    bɨdǐ

    child         cold     3SG.M=have=DECL=ASS
    ‘the child has a cold’       As seen in the examples above, the predicative possessive verb ‘have’ bibùʔ
takes the common verbal morphology (e.g., subject cross-reference proclitics, tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality). The possessed NP of a predicative possessive
construction is not case marked, even when DOM criteria apply (see Chapter 6).
320    A Grammar of Kakua12.5   Comparative constructions
        The function of comparative constructions in Kakua is to assign the relative
position of two referents on a predicative scale. Comparative constructions,
according to the terminology used in Stassen (1985), involve the following elements:
the standard of comparison (the NP indicating the object that serves as the yardstick
of the comparison); the comparee (the object that is being compared); the parameter
(the property on which the comparison is based), and the index (referring to the type
of comparison). The last two, i.e. the parameter and the index, are referred to as the
scale.
        Kakua comparative constructions include those in which the scale of
comparison expresses standards referred to as being less than, more than, and equal
to the compared entity. In these types of constructions, the scale is expressed by verb
roots, without additional TAME morphology, affixes or proclitics. In these cases, the
verb root by itself indicates the scale of comparison. Examples (27)-(29) illustrate
the use of the verb tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’ not functioning as a predicate, but as a scale for
comparison. The order of constituents in comparative constructions is as follows: the
comparee precedes the standard, and the position of the scale of comparison (e.g.,
tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’) is free.27) newě=bǔ jad-wili             tʃaʔ               hap=bǔ=ka

    ‘he is uglier than a flea’       Example (30) involves the use of the verb nɨmʔ ‘be.below’ as a scale for
comparison meaning ‘be less than’. Note that in these examples, as in (27)-(29) above
and (30) below, the verb expressing the scale for comparison does not take additional
TAM affixes and its function within the clause is not that of a predicate, but of a
scale of comparison:

    ‘like this short, the younger brother was shorter (than the older ones), just like
    Chavela’        Semblative comparison, in which the standard and the comparee are
conceived to be of equal degree on a given scale, are formed by using different
particles encoding meanings such as ‘be alike’, ‘like this’, ‘and so like this’, ‘be
equal’, ‘be similar to’. Choosing one particle or another depends primarily on
whether or not the speaker can physically signal the relative dimension of the
standard of comparison, and on the physical proximity of the speaker to the standard
of comparison. For example, if the speaker points to a tree in the distance as the
yardstick for comparison of height, then the particle paniʔna ‘and so like this’ (or its
shortened allomorph panʔ) would be used. This particle is also used whenever the
standard of comparison is not visually accessible. If instead the speaker physically
touches the yardstick of comparison, or uses gestures to indicate its dimensions, then
most often the particle mɨn ‘be equal’ is used.
        Example (30) above, highlights the use of particles mɨn ‘be equal’, and paʔniʔ
‘be alike/be like this’. During the utterance of the first line in the example, the
speaker was indicating how short the younger brother is with a hand gesture, by
placing one hand below with the palm of the hand facing upwards, and the other
hand higher up with its palm facing downwards. In this case the speaker uses the
particle mɨn ‘be equal’. Then, the speaker pointed at Chavela (a young girl listening
to the conversation), expressing that ‘the younger brother’ in the tale was about her
size; for this comparison the speaker uses the particle paʔniʔ ‘be alike/be like this’.
        Additional examples of semblative comparatison are given in (31)-(33) below.

degree among the standards of comparison, is expressed by using the noun niʔat
‘all/everything’, as in (34), or by using an emphasizing construction, as in (35),
where the nominalized verb jǔb ‘be true’ serves to express that the referent of the
noun keh ‘fish’ is the biggest among the referents of the standard of comparison
noun bita ‘others’. These examples additionally illustrate that the noun phrase
expressing the standard can be case-marked. Maybe this indicates that the standard
is regarded as a syntactic object. There is no explanation why it is that sometimes
comparees are object marked while other times they are not (the animacy hierarchy
governing DOM does not seem to predict object marking in these cases).34) newě        niʔat=diʔ          tʃaʔ               hap=bǔ

12.6    Non-verbal predicates
        Non-verbal predicates occur in verbless clauses that are formed by the
juxtaposition of two NPs without a verb. The subject argument always occurs clause-
initially in this type of clauses. Verbless clauses are used to express equative
relations, including identity, class inclusion, and class membership. Examples in
(36)-(39) below illustrate verbless clauses:36) kǎn          fwĩʔ=wâw-daʔ

          1SG=pass-PST-FUT
          ‘I am going to pass to you the ancient songs, now that you are a man,’       Note that an alternative analysis of these constructions may seem to be that
the copula has been omitted, i.e. as ‘zero copula’ construction. According to the
standard definition of copula constructions (Hengeveld 1992, Pustet 2003, and
especially Stassen 1994), a ‘zero copula’ type of construction presupposes that there
is a syntactic slot that is otherwise filled by another element, or in which a copula
occurs optionally under certain grammatical criteria. The examples shown in this
subsection, however, are not considered here as copula constructions with a zero
copula, because it is not the case that in these constructions a syntactic slot remains
empty in a restricted context, while alternating with an overt copula in some other
contexts. The examples presented in this section do not have alternatives with an
overt copula.
       Additionally, the simple juxtaposition of related elements in Kakua is a very
common strategy to express many different types of relations (e.g., derivation of
nouns Chapter 5, possession Chapter 5, coordination of clauses Chapter 13). It should
not be surprising then that expressing these more ‘permanent’ states of being (as
opposed to the less permanent states of being illustrated in the examples in section
§12.2) also appeal to the juxtaposition of elements as a way to express these more
permanent states of being.","[340, 341, 342, 343, 344]"

examples (12)-(15) above. Examples (16)-(21) below illustrate more instances of
recipients, in addition to beneficiaries, and maleficiaries in both transitive and
ditransitive clauses.
     If both objects of a ditransitive clauses have similar status in terms of animacy,
both usually are marked with the object case marker (see §0 below on differential
object marking criteria). Example (16) illustrates an argument in object function with
the semantic role of recipient. Note also that example (19) shows a source (location)
being marked with the object case marker, this is further discussed below:16) wěm=be                     ̃̌

    ‘(they’ve) cursed me’ (a curse has been done on me)       If both object arguments are expressed by noun phrases and both are marked
with the object case marker =diʔ (independently of their semantic role), the order
of constituents is fairly free, and speakers will judge as acceptable various different
alternate orders. See the following example, which was recorded from a conversation
(22)a and posteriorly rearranged and presented to speakers during elicitation (22)b:22) a) Ɲɨjʔ-idip      ʔEbebʔ=diʔ        mɨ ̀=diʔ        wɨʔ̀
       Opossum-bone Venom=OBJ           wild.pig=OBJ give
       ‘Opossum Bone (ɲɨjʔidip) gives Venom (ʔebebʔ) a wild pig’      b) Ɲɨjʔ-idip      mɨ ̀=diʔ          ʔEbebʔ=diʔ      wɨʔ̀
         Opossum-bone wild.pig=OBJ Venom=OBJ              give
         ‘Opossum Bone (ɲɨjʔidip) gives Venom (ʔebebʔ) a wild pig’        Both of these examples were judged by speakers to have the same meaning.
Both examples have two possible interpretations: ‘Opossum Bone gives wild pig to
Venom’ or ‘Opossum Bone gives Venom to wild pig’, where Opossum Bone and
Venom stand for proper names or nick names of two males, and wild pig refers to
an animal. This shows that the order of the two objects is free. In the case of example
(22), since the reading ‘Opossum Bone gives Venom to wild pig’ is pragmatically
                                                   Argument marking and case marking 191odd, speakers usually interpret this sentence with the reading ‘Opossum Bone gives
wild pig to Venom’ even when both readings are acceptable.
       Even though the ordering of objects is syntactically free, I have observed
when doing elicitation that speakers tend to more readily accept an order in which
the participant with a lower/less agentive-like semantic role is placed to the left of
the argument with higher/more agentive semantics.
         In addition to arguments in patient, theme, recipient, beneficiary, and
maleficiary roles, the object marker also occurs on noun phrases with the role of goal
(see example (41) below), and source as in (19) above.","[210, 211, 212, 213]"
"
9.3    Order of verb roots in a SVC
        A further interesting aspect regarding the serialization of verb roots concerns
the order in which the verb roots occur within the SVC. It is known from other
languages that the sequencing of verb roots in a SVC tends to be tense-iconic (c.f.,
Haspelmath 2014:13; Diessel 2008; Aikhenvald 2006:16, 21, 28-29; Durie 1997:§4;
Givón 1991). Likewise, the verb roots of a SVC in Kakua are ordered in such a way
that the verb expressing the earlier event of the sequence is placed at the beginning
of the SVC and is then followed by verb roots expressing later events, in
chronological order. Example (19) below illustrates this:19) ʔã=fwɨb-hɨ ̃wʔ-pàʔ-hɨ ̌j=na
    3SG.M=return-come-float-arrive=DECL
    ‘he came back, floated and arrived’     In example (20) the crying of the child is presented as preceding the arrival, and
therefore the verb root hɨj̃ ̌ ‘cry’ precedes the verb root hɨjbi ‘arrive here’ in the SVC.
This does not imply that the TAME values are different for the roots involved in the
SVC. The TAME values have scope over all of the roots in the construction.20) webit-wili                    ̃̌
                          mi=hɨj-hɨjbi=na=ka
    child-CL:fem          3SG.F=cry-arrive.here=DECL=ASS
    ‘the girl crying arrives here’       Many other functions and meanings of SVCs in Kakua remain to be further
explored in future research. In many other Vaupés languages, for example, in
addition to lexicalized SVCs and temporally iconic sequences of events, SVCs also
serve to express causative relations and simultaneous events. Furthermore,
Aikhenvald (2003, 2006:178-201) describes for Tariana (Arawak language spoken
in the Vaupés area) that certain orderings of the elements of a SVC appear to be non-
iconic with regard to temporality. Thus, the careful focus on SVCs in Kakua show a
promising, very fructiferous aspect of the language that should be further explored.
264    A Grammar of Kakua9.4    Serial verb constructions versus coordination of clauses
        Although many examples of SVCs are translated as coordinated constructions
in English (and Spanish as well), SVCs and coordination are clearly formally
different in Kakua. While SVCs present a string of verb roots having the same tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality values (TAME henceforth), and negation values marked
only once, coordination in Kakua is formed by the juxtaposition of verbs, where each
verb represents a coordinated event and is marked separately for TAME and negation
values.
        See examples (21)-(25) below on coordinated constructions, and compare
these to those shown for SVCs throughout the previous subsection. Note that each
coordinated event takes TAME or negation individually, even when the values are
the same for the entire construction. Example (21) shows a sequence of coordinated
events. Note that each predicate bears its own marking. Verb roots are given in
boldface:21) kǎn=na    ʔã=t-bɨ ̌g-jak                                           ̃̌ ʔ

      ‘(The firefly) fell inside (the firewood) and let out smoke and it lit the fire’        Similarly, consider the examples in (22)–(23) below, illustrating coordination
constructions, in which the SVC clauses are marked individually for TAME. Note
that although the subject argument is not indexed in both predicates of the two
coordinated SVCs in examples in (22) and (23) (because of discourse related criteria,
see Chapter 6), unless specified with different or same subject markers, the
coordinated predicates share the same argument:22) ʔɨdjɨ=bɨt

               Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality10.0 Introduction
        Situating an event or state in time, both externally and internally (via
expression of tense and aspect, c.f., Comrie 1976, 1985; Dahl 1985; Bhat 1999;
Timberlake 2007), and expressing the different perspectives of the speaker toward
the event (via expression of mood, c.f. Bhat 1999; Hengeveld 2004; Timberlake
2007), is achieved in Kakua by verbal morphemes. Some of these can also occur
with other hosts, as will be indicated below for each of the morphemes.
        This chapter deals with the description of the semantics encoded in the
different morphemes that serve to express the speaker’s attitudes towards events or
states, and the general means to express location in time in Kakua. The meanings
involved are treated under the headings of tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality
(henceforth TAME).
        Tense distinctions are described in §10.1. The general characteristics of
aspectual distinctions in Kakua are described in §10.2. The categories of mood are
described in §10.3. Section §10.4 and §10.5 focus on the specific characteristics of
illocution and modality, respectively. Finally, evidentiality is dealt with in section
§10.6 of this chapter.","[284, 285, 286, 287, 288]"

     For the Kakua people,
        and those who left.
Y para mi papi y mami, que
       permanezca lo bello.
       Acknowledgments
         After the many years it took me to sew this grammar together, I couldn’t
possibly come up with a fair list of all the people who helped me on my way.
Completing a dissertation is not only a writing process, but also an emotional ride
of happiness, excitement and despair.
         First, I owe the most heartfelt gratitude to the Kakua people, who allowed for
me to meet them back in 2008, and who later became a group of friends, a family,
taking care of me during the long walks in the inhospitable forest. With patience
they taught me the simplest, most beautiful appreciation for the sublime things and
beings in life. I thank those Kakua ‘who left’ to the forest and did not return, who
left life and kept on going, who passed away and are deeply missed. I especially
want to thank the women of Wacará for their power, for lovingly taking care of me,
and for showing me the formidable force of female wisdom. No acknowledgments
section is long enough, and no language is fair enough to express my gratitude for
the Kakua people.
         I greatly thank my supervisors who had to struggle along with my own
difficulties and periods of being stuck with a single problem, periods that seemed
like a string of eternities. At times I was filled with motivation, but at many others
it felt as if I was only being dragged through to barely make it to an end, or even a
starting, point. Some other times, I was delivering only because I couldn’t bare the
embarrassment of not keeping up with all of the support that seemed to have been
earned without fair merit from my end. I owe my gratitude to Frank Seifart who had
to face the worst effects of frustration, and who had made many sacrifices to walk
along with me and make this dissertation possible; I’m sure that I am still unaware
of many of his sacrifices. Kees Hengeveld always intervened with warm enthusiasm,
and he always offered emotional motivation that transcended beyond the dissertation
itself. Finally, I blame Pattie Epps more than anyone for both the beginning and the
end of this project. It was she who first encouraged me to undertake the
documentation and description of Kakua, and through the inspiration that she spreads
with her passion and endless motivation, even at the least promising times, I kept on
enjoying the ride of building the puzzle that the grammar of Kakua represents to me,
always positively affected by Pattie’s fascination for the project as if it was herself
going through every second of the time it took me to understand Kakua. Thank you
also for warmly taking care of me, personally and academically.
         At the University of Texas at Austin, where I spent my first years of academic
training in linguistics, I also splash some of the blame onto Nora England, who would
unconditionally offer me support, care and force, filling me with the confidence to
face the best parts and the nasty bits of these past years.
         Also at UT Austin, my professors and fellow students provided me with an
inspirational academic environment from which this grammar has greatly benefited.
         My friends Ana Paula Brandão, Telma Can, and Thiago Vital were the
familiar and loving support that only friends can offer when home is far away.
        The department of linguistics at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig stepped
in in 2012 to offer an unbeatable setting for academic development. I thank my
colleagues there for the academic inspiration towards a growth in the fascination for
science.
        My time in Leipzig was filled with colors and love from my friends Iren
Hartmann and Diana Schackow, reaffirming and redefining the meaning of
friendship and family beyond what I have ever experienced: Diana, motivated by
such caring love that she even suffered an uncomfortable train ride to come to my
rescue, and Iren, guiding me out of the darkest places with her strength, compassion
and love. Not only did both my friends provide me with important doses of much
needed alcohol and food, but also left a permanent impression of inspiration and of
strong loving women in academics, as well as friends and family. May life continue
to bring us together, and keep both of you as beautiful, strong and loving as the
women as you are.
        Also in Leipzig, Heriberto Avelino made sure of my emotional wellbeing,
and while he wasn’t exactly a model of decency (more of moral decay and chocolate
overdoses), I hold him deep in my heart for his friendship and love.
        In the world in general I have always run into Martin Kohlberger and always
will, and since I’m such a superstitious person I rapidly learnt that it meant he was
going to be that big part of my heart. I gave in and I couldn’t have had better times
and better laughs. Even during the most obscure times I would always be cheered by
the joy and love that he spreads. Thank you for helping me getting through the rough
unpaved parts of these past years. This grammar is silently infested with your
greatness.
        I thank Sasha Aikhenvald for the time in Cairns and the enthusiasm towards
the completion of this dissertation, and for her comments in some chapters of this
grammar. I also thank Kasia Wojtylak for every warm word and every smile.
        In Cairns I also had the emotional and pharmacological-caffeinated support
and friendship of Nick Piper, whose mere voice and presence was already a
motivation for happiness, not to mention our shared embarrassing TV preferences.
        Natacha Chevrier, for sharing the endless cold nights in Leiden, and always
offering an alternative in case of the apocalypse: ‘an incomplete grammar of Kakua’.
        I also thank the academic panel who revised this grammar for their insights
and stimulating comments.
        En Colombia, a mis amigos que me llenaban de fuerza silenciosa para seguir
trabajando. Saber que regresaba a verlos siempre era un aliciente para los días de
desespero y de ausencias. Federico Viadero, Daniel Castro, Mauricio Concha, Sharay
Cruz, Camilia Gómez Cotta, Madelaynne Montaño, Claudia Andrade, Pilar Blanco.
        Finalmente gracias a mi familia. A mis hermanos Soraya y Vladimir, por el
amor que es lo que hace hermosa la vida. A mis padres, de quienes lo recibí todo, y
que vivieron con fuerza las alegrías de esta aventura Kakua, y me ayudaron a llevar
el peso de las angustias y frustraciones. Solo ustedes saben lo que pasa más allá del
corazón y la mente, cuando la fuerza no es suficiente. Este trabajo es solo parte del
reflejo del inmenso amor, porque sin ese amor, confianza y cuidado, no podría haber
tomado el primer paso.

                    Introduction: Kakua and its speakers
1.0    Introduction
        Kakua is an Amazonian language spoken in the linguistic area of the Vaupés,
in Northwest Amazonia, eastern Colombia (the Ethnologue/ISO 639-3 code for
Kakua is cbv; the WALS code is cac).
        The language is a member of the small Kakua-Nɨkak language family.1 Its
speakers live in inland forest settlements. Two main settlements are home to most of
Kakua’s approximately 250 speakers. The largest of these two settlements is
Wacará2, with 183 individuals.3 Wacará is located between the Vaupés and the
Querarí Rivers in Colombian territory approximately 100 kilometers to the east of
Mitú, near the Brazilian border (see Map 1 below).
        The second bigger Kakua settlement is Nuevo Pueblo, which is an inland
forest village between the Vaupés and the Papurí rivers. The number of inhabitants
of this village is approximately 40 ~ 45 individuals.
        About 10-15 other speakers of Kakua live scattered either in villages inhabited
by speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages (a neighboring language family), or on
their own in remote interfluvial settlements.
        The present work undertakes a grammatical description of the Kakua
language. The description is based mainly on dialects spoken in the Kakua village
of Wacará. Kakua is divided into two main dialect areas (see §1.6 below), in each of
these areas, there are some clan-specific varieties.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"
"
13.1.3 Adversative coordination
       Adversative expressions encoding an emphatic meaning of opposition are
marked with the particle ʔubuʔhéʔti ‘but/although/on the other hand’. Its polysyllabic
form suggests that it is historically complex, but the etymology of this word remains
unclear.3 Some examples of the use of this adversative particle are given below:         3
             Hypothetically this form may be analyzed as follows: ʔu-buʔ=héʔ=ti ‘?-?=INTS=INTS’. The
first unidentified morpheme in this analysis, ʔu, might be a nativized form of the borrowed Spanish
                                                                            Complex Clauses         34911) tɨ ̂j-ni=diʔ                     wěm bid=na=hĩ                         wã=tʃãhap=hĩ

     1SG=EVID-be.happy=EVID but                      3PL=pay-do-NEG=REC.PST
     ‘I would’ve been having a party today if they had paid the work, but they didn’t
     pay’       In addition to the adversative particle ʔubuʔheʔtiʔ, Kakua also uses
juxtaposition to express adversative relations. Although this is more limited, and the
adversative coordinator connector ʔubuʔheʔtiʔ is preferred, a few instances of
juxtaposition with an emphatic adversative meaning are found within the corpus.
Example (13) below illustrates this adversative reading of the juxtaposed
construction. Note that in this construction the emphatic clitic =bǔ is used to encode
a contrast between the emphasized elements (see Chapter 3 for a discussion of the
emphatic semantics of =bǔ):13) kǎn=bǔ                     hɨ ̀dʔ-beʔ=na=wɨt=hĩ                                 kět=bǔ
    3SG.M=EMPH                   show-grow=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST                       3PL=EMPH     têw-wîʔi-kan              ʔɨm=na                kǎn=diʔ
     work-not.exist-NEG be.afraid=DECL 3SG.M=OBJ
     ‘(He) showed (the evil spirit), but they wouldn’t touch (it), they were afraid of
     him’
disjunctive o ‘or’, and the second one, buʔ, might correspond to the emphasis clitic =bǔ. Given the lack
of transparency of the form, no further hypothesis at this point can be drawn.
350 A Grammar of Kakua13.2 Subordination      The combination of clauses in an asymmetric relation in Kakua is realized
through five main strategies. These are presented in the following table, indicating
which strategy is used for which kind of subordination:Table 13.1 Subordination strategies in Kakua

 the verb of the
 subordinate clause         As shown in Table 13.1 above, these five different subordinating strategies
are used to form three types of subordinate construction in Kakua. A canonical
description of subordination regards it as a particular type of combination of clauses,
such that one of them is syntactically and semantically dependent on the other (c.f.,
Langacker 1991, Cristofaro 2003). The subordinate clause functions as a constituent
of the higher clause. This presupposes a distinction between main clauses and
subordinate clauses. I follow here the general definitions of these three types of
subordinate constructions as defined in e.g. van Gijn et al (2011:3), Cristofaro
(2003), and Haumann (1997): complement clauses, which function as arguments of
the verb of the superordinate clause, are described in §13.5; relative clauses, which
function as modifiers of a noun phrase in the superordinate clause, are described in
§13.6, and adverbial clauses, which modify the verb of the higher clause or the higher
clause in its entirety, are described in §13.7.
       As shown above, subordinate clauses in Kakua can often be identified by
morphological cues (suffixes, clitics, particles, or even verb roots): i.e., there are
morphological elements that serve to identify the subordinate clause in a complex
clause construction (Table 13.1). These elements, as introduced in Table 13.1, have
                                                              Complex Clauses      351different syntactic positions with regard to the subordinate clause. They can be in
initial position of the subordinate clause (as with the temporal adverbial particle
tɨtimaʔ ‘then’), be cliticized to an element of the subordinate clause (as with switch
reference markers when used to link adverbial subordinate clauses, see §13.7 below),
suffixes (as with the subordinator suffix -ni, see §13.5 and §13.6 below), or as post-
or prepositions (as with the potential particle pînaʔ ‘POT’ see §13.7 below).
        As presented in Chapter 11, the preferred order of constituents in Kakua is
that in which the predicate of the clause is in final position (S)OV. Adjuncts and
subordinate clauses tend to occur embedded in the main clause (see, however,
examples of exceptions to this in §13.4 for tail-head linkage, and in §13.5 for
complement clauses). The internal structure of the embedded clause also tends to
maintain the preferred OV order. Thus, in an asymmetric combination of clauses
(subordination), there are going to be two predicates, one pertaining to the
subordinated clause, and another one pertaining to the superordinate clause. A
structure similar to the following is typical for an asymmetric combination of clauses
in Kakua, where the square brackets refer to the subordinate clause in the
construction: (S)[(S)OV]OV.
        The subordinate clause furthermore in the majority of cases precedes the
element that it modifies or is an argument of in the main clause. Thus, complement
clauses (§13.5) in the majority of cases precede the predicate of the main clause, as
follows: (S)[COMPLEMENT]V (see discussion of exceptions below). Likewise, relative
clauses (§13.6) tend to precede the N they modify, but relative clauses may also
follow their head. Example (14) illustrates a complement clause that precedes its
head, the predicate of the main clause.","[369, 370, 371, 372]"

C. Other obligatorily possessed entities
        Terms referring to objects that are closely associated with people or that are
indispensable for subsistence are also inherently possessed. Therefore, nouns
referring to these elements must always be encoded within a possessive construction.
The set of other obligatorily possessed entities includes the followingː          i)            Clan and language affiliation, family, friend-companion, shadow,
                        souls.
          ii)           Some terms denoting emotions and feelings, and nominalized
                        forms of some verbs.108) měm               bâra-ǐʔ           hĩʔhẽʔ fwǐʔ=mɨ ̀n-at            hĩʔhẽʔ

verbs. When nominalized, these descriptive verbs are obligatorily possessed.110) wěm               ʧèjbit             kûʔu-ni=bǔ

        In addition to the strategies presented above for the expression of possessive
relations, Kakua encodes a possessive relation between nouns referring to animate
entities and a place to which the entity is affiliated (the ‘belonging’ of an animate
referent to a certain place). The morphemes marking this type of possessive relation
are called here associative markers. Associative markers are clitics that have a
singular form =bû ‘ASSOC.SG’, and a plural counterpart =mǔn ‘ASSOC.PL’:114) Colombia=diʔ=bû

                 Argument marking and case marking6.0    Introduction
        This Chapter presents a description of Kakua’s syntactic and morphological
strategies for coding grammatical relations of arguments, and also describes case
marking for adjuncts.
        The grammatical relations of arguments in Kakua are marked by
morphological and syntactic means. An interesting characteristic of the coding of
grammatical relations in Kakua is its mixture of head-marking and dependent-
marking strategies (in terms of Nichols 1986).
        Subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb (a head-marking strategy),
while object arguments (encompassing any argument in a function other than
subject), receive case morphology, marked on the NPs themselves (a dependent-
marking strategy, see examples 1-3 in Chapter 3).
        Kakua’s alignment is strictly nominative-accusative. Object arguments and
adjuncts receive case marking. This is summarized in Table 6.1 below:Table 6.1 Kakua case markers

pronouns.
       In the subsequent sections of this Chapter I provide a description of the
characteristics of the coding of grammatical relations and case markers in Kakua.
       The expression of subject arguments is described in section §0. Object
arguments in Kakua are morphologically marked by case; this is described in §0.
184      A Grammar of KakuaThe obligatoriness/optionality of overtly marking object case is determined by
Differential Object Marking conditions, this is discussed in §0. Section §0 provides
a description of the marking of case for adjuncts, namely locative,
comitative/instrumental, and terminative case.","[202, 203, 204, 205, 206]"
"7.1    Personal pronouns
       The Kakua pronominal system has three different sets of forms: free forms,
bound pronouns (that serve to express possessive relations as described in §5.3, or
to encode cross-reference to the subject argument as described in Chapter 8), and
possessive pronouns (occurring in alienable possession, described in §5.3). Table 7.1
summarizes the forms and functions of the three sets of pronouns in Kakua.

        As can be seen in Table 7.1, Kakua pronouns encode person and number.
Gender is specified only for the 3 rd person singular forms. The 3rd person singular
pronoun kǎn ‘3SG.M’ is obviously related to the proximate demonstrative form kan
‘PROX.DEM’. The 3rd person singular pronoun kǎn ‘3SG.M’, can in principle be used
for inanimate referents (‘this/it’), and animate male (or unspecified for gender)
referents (‘he’) (it is a non-feminine form, see below) and is glossed in the texts as
‘3SG.M’. For inanimate 3rd person singular referents, the demonstrative form kan is
used most often. Therefore, kan is glossed as either ‘PROX.DEM’ or ‘3SG.M’ according
to the context. If encoding deixis is its main function, then it is glossed as
‘PROX.DEM’, whereas if in pronominal function it refers to an inanimate referent, it
is glossed as ‘3SG.M’. Section §7.3 below describes the forms and functions of
demonstratives in Kakua.
        Gender distinctions in the forms for 3rd singular pronouns are best understood
as feminine versus non-feminine.1 The forms kǎnʔ and mi= strictly encode female
gender for 3rd person singular, while for all other referents, the pronouns kǎn
‘3SG.M’ and ʔã= ‘3SG.M’ are used even when the gender of the referent is not strictly
male, or is unspecified. All of the pronominal forms shown in Table 7.1 above, can
be further specified by feminine gender. This is done by attaching the feminine suffix
classifier -wili:2)      wěm-wili
        1SG-CL:fem
        ‘I (female)’
1
    For the sake of consistency, kǎn, ʔã= and ʔãǰʔ=, are glossed as ‘3SG.M’ throughout this work, even
when the referent is not male.

     chase.away-A.NMLZ
     ‘he was the one who chased away the jaguars’ (he was the jaguar chaser)       The bound pronouns (proclitics) are normally bound to a head noun or verb.
When bound to verbs, the proclitics serve as cross-references to the subject argument
of the clause (see Chapter 6 on argument marking in Kakua).
       The set of pronouns that are called “bound pronouns” can also occur without
being attached to a head noun or verb, but in this case the bound pronoun must
always be followed by another clitic to form a phonological word. The contexts
motivating the constructions of the pronouns without a head noun or verb need to be
explored in future research.
       An example of the proclitic occurring with additional morphology only,
lacking a head noun or verb, is illustrated in (5) below:5)   fwɨb=be               mâ-naʔ          kan      ʔã=be           wɨw
     return=REC.PST        tree-CL:tree     3SG.M    3SG.M=REC.PST caiman     wã=beʔên=tâ=tik                     ʔã=be            wɨw
     1SG=recognize=INF.EVID=INTS          3SG.M=REC.PST caiman
     ‘I came back, (with) a stick I recognized the caiman, he must have been a
     caiman!’        Unlike the free pronouns, the forms of the bound pronouns do not have lexical
tone specification; instead, their tone value is assigned by the elements in the
surrounding environment to which the proclitics are attached (usually the tonal value
is assigned by the roots to which the pronoun is clitized). In cases such as the one
presented in (5) above, where the bound pronoun lacks a head, and instead it occurs
only with other morphology, which are themselves also toneless, the entire set of
bound morphemes is realized with a low tone.
        When pronominal forms function as subjects, objects, or comitative or
locative adjuncts they take case markers indicating their function within the clause:
214     A Grammar of Kakua6)    kǎnʔ       kan=diʔ            mi=t-hěmʔ-ep=wɨt=be
      3SG.F         3SG.M=OBJ        3SG.F=EVID-eat-PST=REP.EVID=REC.PST
      ‘She ate it’ (it is said)       As described in Chapter 5, (bound) pronouns can be used to indicate
possessive relationships. Inalienably possessed nouns take bound pronouns, while
alienably and inherently possessed nouns take the possessive (bound) pronouns (see
Chapter 5, §5.3, for description of possession). As mentioned in Chapter 5 (§5.3),
the possessive pronominal forms in Kakua are derived from a combination of the
bound forms of the pronouns with the possessor marker –íʔ. This is shown in Table
7.1 above in the column of possessive pronouns. An example of an alienably
possessed noun marked with the possessive bound pronoun is given in example (7)
below:7) ʔãjʔ=namǎ=bǔ                   kǎn     kãk=bɨt
   3SG.M.POSS=path=LOC               3SG.M    person=ALSO     ʔãjʔ=namǎ=bǔ
     3SG.M.POSS=path=LOC
     ‘[they parted…], he (the armadillo) on his way, and the person also on his way’        Free pronominal forms do not have variants when used as possessive forms.
        Kakua pronouns can have anaphoric functions, referring back to a previously
mentioned noun or noun phrase, as discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 (§11.2 on
subject alignment).
          In Kakua narratives, usually a (3SG.M) pronoun is sufficient to refer to the
main participant of the story, and the expression of the participant as a lexical noun
is not necessary. Example (8) below illustrates a situation in which two participants
of the narrated event are being referred to by using 3SG.M pronouns only:8)    kǎn        kǎn=diʔ           ʔã=t-těw-hip=tagǎ
      3SG.M        3SG.M=OBJ         3SG.M=EVID-shot.darts-DUB=INF.EVID
      ‘he (the person) shot darts to him (the jaguar)’       Like the demonstrative form kan (see above), the third person pronoun can
also be used for generic reference to inanimate entities in general, or abstract
concepts like thoughts, feelings, or ideas. The bound pronoun highlighted in bold in
example (9), anaphorically refers to the derived noun higaɁ-at     ̃̂      be.sad-NMLZ
‘sadness’. It can also be translated into ‘it (the sadness)’. Example (10) illustrates an
instance of the pronoun kǎn used for generic anaphoric reference.

7.2     Interrogative pronouns and question words
       The interrogative pronouns in Kakua are built from the element de-, to which
other morphological material is added. The interrogative pronominal forms are given
in Table 7.2 below:Table 7.2 Interrogative Pronouns

  who                                      dêʔe       These pronouns can be used as arguments of clauses, as shown in the
following examples:11) dêʔe=ti=be                    mem=diʔ          ʔã=t-ʔên

    ‘I’m saying, who is going to talk?’       An interrogative mood marker =nit may optionally be cliticized to the verb

    which=INTS          2SG=want=INTERR
    ‘which (one) do you want?’       Interrogative pronouns, as is the case for the rest of the pronominal forms in
Kakua, do not have different forms when functioning as subject, object, comitative,
locative, etc. Thus, if functioning as an object argument, for example, the
interrogative pronoun does not change its basic form and instead it optionally takes
the object case marker, compare examples (15) and (16) with (17) and (18) below:17) dêʔe=diʔ=ti=be                 ma=ʔên
    who=OBJ=INTS=REC.PST            2SG=see

    what=OBJ=INTS 2SG           know
    ‘what (story) do you know?’        Interrogative pronouns can take the possessive suffix -íʔ to encode possessive
relations, as in (19), or be compounded to a noun stem as in (20) below. Note that
in cases such as that illustrated in example (20) below, the interrogative pronoun is
not considered a procliticized form (as with the proclitic personal pronouns) because,
unlike proclitic personal pronouns (possessive personal pronouns), the interrogative
pronoun can stand on its own, like other interrogative words (i.e., can occur
syntactically unbound, like example (23) below where the interrogative dě ‘where’
occurs on its own. Most commonly, however, the interrogative pronouns occur
together with intensifiers or emphasis markers):19) dêʔe-íʔ  tigǎ     nin-mɨ ̃̌-hǐw

    ‘whose dog is this one right here?’            ̃̌

    who-son=OBJ=INTS=REC.PST                 2SG=see
    ‘whose son did you see?’        Kakua has a set of forms that are homophonous to the element de- present in
the interrogative forms: the inferred future evidentiality enclitic =dê ‘INF.FUT.EVID’;
and the noun dê ‘relative’ (‘person who is related). The extent to which these forms
may or may not be related is unknown.

that are also built from the element de-. These question words are given in Table 7.3

Note that in example (22) the particle paʔniʔ ‘and so’ presumably functions as a
clause linker, with the interrogative pronoun initiating a new clause.21) děd=paʔ           fǐt    fĩ=fwîʔ=hĩ

      ‘they stayed there for, hmmm… how many?, another month?’       As seen in this section, Kakua interrogative pronouns and question words are
built on a basic de- form. Semantically, both interrogative pronouns and question
words can be considered to fall into one class of interrogative words. Functionally,
however, these words form two different sets: the set of interrogative words that
have pronominal function, and the set of interrogative words with adverbial
functions.
                                                  Elements of the noun phrase         2197.3    Demonstratives
        Kakua has a demonstrative system which makes three distinctions: proximate,
distal, and immediate proximate. The forms of demonstratives are given in Table 7.4
below:Table 7.4 Kakua demonstrative pronouns
 Function                                            Form Demonstrative Pronoun Proximate ‘there/this’
                                                             kan                                                             kun ~ kǔn ~ nun
 Distal ‘that’
                          masculine ‘this right              nin
 Immediate                here’
 proximate                feminine ‘this right               ninʔ
                          here’        The proximate and distal demonstrative forms, kan and kun respectively, can
be specified for gender if necessary (unlike immediate proximate forms, which are
already inflected for feminine gender in their basic form). In such cases, the classifier
-wili may be suffixed to the demonstrative form as follows: kan-wili ‘this (female)’,
and kun-wili ‘that (female)’.
        Additionally, the 3rd person singular feminine personal pronoun, kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’,
can be used as a demonstrative when referring to female animate beings that are
(spatially) proximate to the speaker, and in such cases it is preferred over kan-wili.
        As mentioned in §7.1 above regarding the 3rd person singular pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’, both kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kan ‘PROX.DEM’ can be used with the same deictic
meaning. It is also possible that the proximate demonstrative form kan was the
historical source of the pronominal forms kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ (following a
crosslinguistically common development of 3 rd person pronouns from
demonstrative), but the pronominal forms include further phonological
specifications, which suggests that a reverse development might also be possible.
        The proximate demonstrative kan ‘PROX.DEM’ is used to refer to objects
which are spatially close to speaker, to the hearer or to both. It is not used for objects
immediately next to the speaker, for which the immediate proximate demonstrative,
nin or ninʔ, is used. The proximate demonstrative is also used to refer to something
that has already been mentioned in the discourse, e.g. ‘the one there’, or ‘this
aforementioned’ object. The proximate demonstrative can be translated as English
‘this’ or ‘there’, and is glossed as such where appropriate:27) kan=jǔb=pûʔba
    there=EMPHZ:be.true=EMPH
    ‘right there, all right!’

    ‘he lived over there also’        The distal demonstrative kun ‘DIST.DEM’ is used to refer to referents far away
from the speaker, hearer, or both (32). Its alternate forms are kǔn and nun. The use
of the distal demonstrative is usually accompanied by a pointing gesture signaling
towards the (imagined, in the case of stories, for example) location of the referred
entity. The referent can be either visible or not visible to speaker and hearer. This
distal demonstrative has an alternate form nun as shown in Table 7.4 above. The
criteria conditioning the use of one over the other seem to correspond to clan dialectal
variation but need to be investigated further.","[233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"

constructions in Amazonian languages (see Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999: 8).
       Possessive pronouns in Kakua are proclitics formed by the fusion of the bound
pronominal forms and the possessive suffix -ǐʔ (see Table 5.4 below. A description
of the pronominal paradigm in Kakua is given in Chapter 7).

5.3.2 Two types of obligatorily possessed nouns: inalienable possession and
      inherently possessed nouns
       Obligatorily possessed nouns represent a closed set of nouns that cannot occur
without a possessor which is phonologically bound (cliticized) to the possessed noun.
Obligatorily possessed nouns are further divided into two groups: ‘inalienable’ and
‘obligatorily’ possessed nouns. These differ in the way they are marked for
possession. While inalienably possessed nouns do not take possessive pronouns or
possessive suffixes, obligatorily possessed nouns do.
       In Kakua morphosyntax only kinship terms are treated as inalienable. Body
part terms, parts of plants, and other terms referring to things closely related to
humans, could be considered conceptually ‘obligatorily’ possessed entities, but
although these terms are obligatorily possessed, their morphological expression of
possession is crucially different from the inalienable nouns (they are not possessed
using the inalienable strategy).
       The literature on possessive constructions (e.g., Nichols 1988, Chappell &
McGregor 1996, Heine 1997, Mithun 2001) has pointed out the difficulty to
universally describe a cross-linguistic characterization of the class of nouns that can
typically be identified for inalienable possession. As pointed out by Nichols
(1988:572), ‘inalienable’ possessed nouns vary both semantically and structurally.
                             Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 173       Nichols (1988:572) proposed the following implicational hierarchy to predict
which concepts are cross-linguistically the most likely one to be morphosyntactically
treated as ‘inalienable’:                     1. Kin terms and/or body parts
                     2. Part-whole and/or spatial relations
                     3. Culturally basic possessed items        Nichols places body parts and kinship terms at the top of the scale noting that
while “kinterms and body parts disjointly head the implicational hierarchy, it can be
said that kin terms are more strongly represented” (Nichols 1988:573).
        Accordingly, the ‘inalienable’ group of nouns in Kakua is only represented
by kinship terms, reflecting Nichols’ observation about kin terms being the nouns
that are cross-linguistically most frequently treated as ‘inalienables’. In the following
sections I present more extensively the way in which Kakua expresses the notion of
inalienability vs. inherently (obligatorily) possessed nouns.","[193, 194, 195]"
"       Kakua displays a complex system of evidentiality, and many markers
(prefixes and enclitics), encode different evidentiality values. In SVCs, one
evidentiality value has scope over all the elements of the clause, and no additional
                                                                          Verb serialization           261or different value may be given to its elements individually (see Section §10.6, on

marking, for all arguments other than the subject of a clause, and subject indexing
on the verb by cross-referencing proclitics (see Chapter 6 on argument marking).
     All the verbs in a SVC always share the same arguments in the clause, i.e. the
subject and objects, if present, see example (15) below. Even when no cross-
referencing proclitic is present (when its referent was previously established in the
discourse, one of the exceptions allowing for the omission of subject indexing on the
verb; see Chapter 6 and Chapter 11), the verbs in the serialized construction have
the same arguments. In example (15), ‘he’ is the subject of both ‘burn’ and ‘give’
and ‘tobacco’ is the object of both of these verbs.","[281, 282]"

from a distance far from the actor) do not satisfy the criteria of freedom of host

after a string of clitic positions of their host. Thus, describing them as affixes would
fail to account for the identity of the morphemes (clitics) which precede these set of
clitics which do not have freedom of host selection.
        The status of case markers as clitics vs. affixes will be discussed in some
detail here, as one example how clitics can be distinguished from affixes in Kakua.
Case markers have freedom of host selection in that they attach to nouns and
adjectives (which share some, but not all characteristics of nouns, see section 3.3.5).
On the other hand, case markers may only occur on verbs if these are in the
subordinate clause (see Chapter 12 for a description of subordinate clauses in
Kakua). Case markers also display a greater freedom of movement than affixes in
two further respects. Firstly, they can occur on only one element of the noun phrase,
rather than on each individual elements of the noun phrase (examples (4)-(8), which
can be the second (4)-(6) or the first element (7).4) mâw-bɨ ̂di-ip=wɨt=hĩ                      [nin-dê]=diʔ

      (long ago when the eclipse was passing) they asked the dead cadaver’ (Spanish
      ‘el cadaver finado’)        Affixes, unlike any other type of morpheme in Kakua (this includes clitics
and all of the word classes), can have syllables without onsets (see Table 3.3 below),
or consist of just a consonant (Table 3.4). Also, only affixes can have unspecified
vowels in their underlying structure. Thus, they allow for the copying of the vowel
quality of the host to which they attach. As mentioned above, affixes do not have
freedom of host selection. A list illustrating some representative examples of suffixes
in Kakua and their hosts is given in Table 3.3 below:Table 3.3 Examples of suffixes in Kakua

encoding second hand evidentiality in its reduced form t- (see Chapter 10 for
description of evidentiality), when preceding a consonant-initial stem (prefix-CVC),
violate the phonological restriction in Kakua that disallows consonant clusters. Note
that exceptions to phonological restrictions in Kakua occur for other affixes as well
(e.g. vowel copying and the onset-less syllables mentioned above). In what follows
of this section, I present a set of three enclitics that can attach to various word classes
to express emphasis or intensity of that constituent. These forms are: = jǔb, which
serves as an intensifier to nouns, with the semantic meaning of ‘truly’, or ‘really’.
Example (9) illustrates this verb root jǔb ‘be true’, from which this intensifier
derives, occurring within a verbal construction. Example (10) shows the function of
=jǔb as an intensifier of a pronoun:9) panʔni=tiʔ           nih-ip wɨd-jǔb=na=hĩ
    and.so=INTS         say-PST swallow-be.true =EMPH=DECL=REM.PST

    fire.wood burn-finish          3SG.M=OBJ=INTS                 burn
    ‘once the fire was on, (I) burned him really’        This intensifier has freedom of host selection, and it can as well occur with
another adverb, intensifying the meaning of the adverb to which it attaches. This is
illustrated in (11) below:11) fɨ ̂b-hɨ ̌j=nit=na               kǎn=diʔ           bɨká=jǔb

     ‘when we returned we burned him really at last, at last!’
102   A Grammar of Kakua        In addition to the intensifier =jǔb ‘truly’ illustrated above, Kakua narratives
are full of the intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ. Its meaning is that of an affirmation
such as ‘truly’ or ‘exactly’. This intensifier =ti can also occur with both, nouns and
verbs:12) ʔã=t-hɨw̌ ʔ=hĩ=tiʔ          pɨ                   wẽp-ep=héʔ

     ‘the grandfather Sabino, in reality was my dad’       The intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ occurs commonly in interrogative clauses,
with interrogative pronouns and question words, and in adverbial particles such as
paniʔ=tiʔ ‘and so=INTS’, tɨt=tiʔ =ma ‘then’, and with the adverbial particle
hunhã=tiʔ ‘long.ago=INTS’.14) ʔĩ=ʔêw=na         hunhã=ti,           bêʔe=nit     hun=héʔ

     ‘just like this they always use to say’       The enclitic =héʔ expresses contrastive adverbial emphasis like the English
expression ‘just’, or ‘indeed’. This enclitic can attach to both verbs (16), nouns (17)
and pronouns (18):16) wã=beh-ep=hĩ                 fwaʔ-kan=héʔ fwaʔ-kan=héʔ

3.2    Open classes
3.2.0 Introduction
        Nouns and verbs conform the two open classes of words in Kakua.
        The elements of the open word classes in Kakua have, in principle, an
unlimited membership. That is to say, the open classes of words in Kakua may
include not only native words, but also readily accept borrowings, calques, and any
other type of new lexical items such as words newly formed by semantic extensions
or by the lexicalization of formerly more complex words (e.g., historical compounds
that have undergone morphological and/or phonological fusion to form one complex
lexical item).
        The main element of the members of open classes is a noun or verb root that
heads the noun or verb phrase accordingly.
        Roots can be further divided into those that can occur as free elements and
those that are obligatorily bound with inflectional or derivational morphology
(Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the different free and obligatorily bound noun roots. Verb
are described in Chapters 8 and 9).
        In this study a free morpheme is understood as an element that is
phonologically independent, i.e. it is not obligatorily bound to another free
morpheme or to other bound morphology in order to form a full word.
        A major distinction between Kakua noun and verb roots concerns the
morphology each of these requires. Kakua nouns are formed by a free root that can
occur without the need of additional morphology. Verbs, on the other hand, require
for the most part a more complex morphology.
        The main semantic, phonological, syntactic and morphological characteristics
of Kakua nouns and verbs are described in the following subsections. Subsection
§3.2.1 describes these main characteristics that define Kakua nouns. §3.2.2 deals
with the main properties that characterize verbs.","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"        For temporal adverbial clauses, Kakua also uses bare verb roots (see §13.4
above) (note that this is a different strategy than verb serialization. See Chapter 9).
In addition to the verb pêa ‘finish’, other verbs with similar semantics can be used
in this function, e.g., běd ‘extinguish’ or pê ‘be.last’ (these verbs are non-finite, used
in their bare form, i.e., without any additional morphology). Examples (42)-(44)
illustrate the use of such verbs as temporal linkers between the adverbial clause and
the main clause. Note that, like complement and relative clauses, the adverbial
subordinate clause precedes the main clause being modified. Note also that the verb
does not necessarily need to be a bare verb root in order to serve as an adverbial
clause linker (see also example (20) above, where these verbs appear to link two
main clauses, instead of marking a subordinate clause):       ̃́
42) [wiʔ=têw-at=diʔ        běd=nit]                               ̃́

    ‘[after you’ve finished filtering (the manioc milk)] sweep off the dirt from the
    house’        An adverbial particle frequently used in Kakua to indicate temporal
sequencing of events is tɨtimaʔ ‘then’. In example (45) below the adverbial particle
links a nominalized subordinate clause (see below) to a main clause:45) wěm bɨ ̀ wã=tɨ ̀j-beʔ-bɨ ̌g
    1SG today 1SG=be.good-grow-fall    [kǎnʔ=tiʔ          mi=kûʔ-at                         tɨtimaʔ]

    today       1SG=be.good-grow-PST AT.LAST
    ‘Today I’m better, after she gave (me) her medicine, I am better finally’       Additionally, Kakua has a set of other adverbial particles (see Chapter 3,
section §3.3.6 on adverbs) that can serve as temporal adverbial linkers between a
main clause and a subordinate clause.46) panʔ       ʔã=nih-at            pũniʔ                     ̌ ʔ-hip

    ‘So, they gave me lots of their usual ants’        Purpose adverbial clauses can take the potential morpheme pînaɁ ‘POT’.
Unlike the other subordinate clauses, purpose adverbial subordinate clauses follow
the main clause. The potential morpheme pînaɁ ‘POT’ does not have any evident
etymological source. The fact, however, that it forms adverbial clauses that are
different from all other ones in that they follow the main clause, may suggest a
historic development of pînaɁ ‘POT’ that is different from other Kakua particles.48) ma=têw-buʔé=na               ʔĩ=t-nihi=wɨt=hĩ

    2SG.POSS=be.strong-NMLZ POT
    ‘learn how to work, they said [for your strength]’       Also in the absence of adverbial particles, the nominalization of the predicate
of the subordinate clause is used in Kakua as a type of adverbial subordination to
describe a result or a process together with its result. Note that nominalization is a
common strategy that South American languages use to create subordinate clauses
(van Gijn et al. 2011:3). In Kakua, nominalizations can function in the same way as
other subordinate clauses, where the adverbial subordinate clause precedes the main
clause being modified. The subject of the nominalized verb is also the subject of the
superordinate clause. Examples are given below:49) [jěw         ocho             hɨm-at=dê]                   ̌ ʔɨ=tʃaʔ

predicate construction with the verb root hîb. The use of this verb to express a causal
relation seems to be falling out of use, and only a few older people still use this verb
with a meaning such as ‘do as a consequence of’. Some speakers reported still
knowing and using this verb with such a meaning; however, they still attributed the
correct use of this verb to the older generation. Also, while in an elicitation session
with an elderly speaker, the young men accompanying the session would inquire
about the meaning of hîb when used by the older speaker. The following example
illustrates an instance where the verb hîb is used to express a causal relation:51) ʔã=t-ʔɨw              ʔã=t-hîb                           hiw      kǎn=diʔ

    3SG.M=EVID-eat=REP.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘Since he fell asleep, the jaguar ate him’       Younger speakers make use of some of the adverbial strategies in order to
construct causal relations, but more often by linking clauses via bare verb roots
(described in 13.4 above), resulting in constructions like the elicited example in (52)
below:52) ʔã=t-ʔɨw-ɨp=be                          ʔɨwɨ     hiw       kǎn=diʔ

    3SG.M=EVID-eat=REP.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘he fell asleep. Sleeping, the jaguar ate him’ (because he fell asleep, the jaguar
    ate him)
368 A Grammar of Kakua13.9 Summary
       Kakua has different mechanisms of expressing the relation between events:       i)        Verb serialization, which serves to express events that are
                 conceptually integrated into a bigger event (described in Chapter 9)
                 and which is not a combination of clauses,
       ii)       coordination, which serves to express a symmetrical relationship
                 among different independent clauses (described in §13.1 in the
                 present chapter),
       iii)      subordination, which expresses a dependent relationship among the
                 combined clauses (described from §13.2 onwards in the present
                 chapter).","[385, 386, 387, 388, 389]"
"
10.3 Mood: illocution and modality
        The modal categories in Kakua are very versatile and encode many more
distinctions than any other category related to the event or situation encoded by the
predicate.
        While tense and aspect deal with temporal particularities of a proposition
(‘external temporal constituency’ and ‘internal temporal constituency’, respectively,
as in Comrie 1976:3), mood deals with finer specifications regarding the status of
the proposition, reflecting a speaker’s attitude towards the proposition, “not directly
concerned with situating an event in the actual world, as conceived by the speaker”
(Hengeveld 2004:1190). Consequently, mood in Kakua is described here as the
morphological category that is not anchored to an expression of time, but rather it is
concerned with expressing “the status of the proposition” describing the event (I
follow here Palmer’s 2001 general definition of mood). This is to say, mood in Kakua
conforms to a cross-linguistic grammatical category that expresses something about
the speaker’s view of the proposition (c.f. Bybee 1990, Palmer 2001, Hengeveld
2004 for discussions of mood).
        Hengeveld (2004) proposes a subdivision of the category of mood into
illocution and modality, illocution being “instances of specific types of speech acts”,
while modality is “concerned with the modification of the content of speech acts”
(Hengeveld 2004:1190). In the subsequent sections I follow Hengeveld’s division of
mood, and describe separately illocution and modality as categories of mood in
Kakua. The motivation for adopting Hengeveld’s division of mood categories is
mainly a semantic one. Dividing the mood markers in Kakua into two groups helps
                                                  Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality            281to better describe their semantics: illocution markers are ‘unqualified’ expressions
of the speech acts, whereas modality markers do express the type of relationship,
expectations, or attitude of the speaker towards the content of these speech acts
(modality can “modify the content of the speech acts” ibid). Additionally, only the
group of illocution markers can constitute types of clauses. The same cannot be said
for the modality markers, which do not form types of clauses (there are no clauses
such as ‘frustrative clauses’ or ‘dubitative clauses’).
        The semantics of these categories are described in the subsequent sections.
Section §10.4 describes grammatical morphemes encoding illocution, 5 and section
§10.5 describes the different morphemes expressing modality. Evidentiality is
presented separately in §10.6. Note that all three categories are considered to be part
of the overall mood category in Kakua.
        A formal distinction between illocution and modality, as presented in
Hengeveld (2004), is that “in the expression of illocution the morphological category
of mood has to compete with word order and intonation as markers of particular
subdistinctions, whereas modality is expressed by mood markers only” (Hengeveld
2004:1190). As shown in the subsequent sections, although one of the illocution
morphemes comes along with a particular intonation, it is not necessarily the case
that illocution morphemes in Kakua, as opposed to modality morphemes, compete
in terms of word order and intonation with other subdistinctions. Rather, I will say
that the primary distinction between illocution markers and modality markers in
Kakua, is that, as stated above, illocution markers have the ability to indicate a clause
type, whereas modality markers does not.
        Morphosyntactically, it cannot be said that there is a distinction that
characterizes one or the other type of mood. Although most of these markers have
their own dedicated morphosyntactic slots, and while most occur following the stem
(as suffixes or enclitics), there are some in prefixing position (specifically
evidentiality markers).","[301, 302]"
"         5
           I have chosen to give different glosses here, even though it might be the case that the suffix
-ni is actually acting as a nominalizer in both cases. If this was the case, examples like the one in (60)
could be interpreted as ‘the ripe one’ (i.e. a noun-noun compound). Likewise, example in (61) dɨw-ni ‘the
carrier’ could be interpreted as ‘(the one who is a) carrier'. It may thus be that the difference between
what I am labeling ‘ADJVZ’ versus ‘A.NMLZ’ has to do merely with the modifier vs. head status of the
element taking -ni (and maybe the active vs. stative status of the verb that is undergoing the derivation),
as opposed to an actual dual function of the suffix. Therefore, the difference in glossing does not
necessarily reflect a strong distinction in the function of this suffix, but rather, it is used to indicate the
type of derivation best reflects the translation.

discuss the origins of Kakua adjectives.
        Synchronically Kakua adjectives behave differently from descriptive verbs,
but good hypotheses can be made with regard to the etymological origin of these
words.
        The adjectives hap ‘tall/up’, and hâp ‘new’ could be derived from the spatial
noun hâbʔ ‘up river’. In this case, hypothetically, the noun hâbʔ ‘up river’ developed
tone differentiations as well as the devoicing of the final consonant. However, an
argument for a reverse process can also be proposed. In other words, it could also
be that the spatial noun hâbʔ ‘up river’ has been derived from the adjectives hap
‘tall/up’ and/or hâp ‘new’. This last argument, however, does not explain why other
spatial nouns have no clear resemblances with adjectives. 6 I consider these to be less
likely scenarios for the development of these adjectives. An alternative scenario
follows.
        Another possible scenario is that both hap and hâp derived from the verb hâ
‘to get up’ plus the past marker of verbs, -Vp, resulting in the inflected form hâ-ap
‘get.up-PST’. This is a more likely scenario, for at least three reasons: First, because
it is consistent with the general pattern that adjectival concepts are expressed through
descriptive verbs, so that one may expect that the attributive concepts ‘tall, up, new’
have initially been descriptive verbs. Second, because it is consistent with the
analysis for the other two Kakua adjectives bɨdǐ ‘big’and jehěp ‘bad’, which will
leave us with one general explanation for the origin of a closed class of adjectives,
coming from verbs, instead of several different strategies for obtaining adjectives as
       6
           Note that in either of these scenarios the semantic link of ‘new’ remains unclear.
120   A Grammar of Kakuaa separate class from verbs and nouns. Finally, adjectives in Kakua can function as
verbs, taking all the available verbal morphology, suggesting that adjectives in Kakua
have a verbal origin.
        The same argument given above to account for the derivation of the adjective
words hâp ‘new’, and hap ‘tall/up’, can serve to explain the diachronic development
of the adjective word jehěp ‘bad’. It could be argued that jehěp ‘bad’ is a lexicalized
form from the verb jěh ‘be.damaged’ plus the general past marker –Vp: jěh-ep
‘be.damaged-PST’. Because of phonological processes, the realization of a rising tone
in a bisyllabic morpheme is assigned to the last syllable, and thus, the tone of the
verb root jěh ‘be.damaged’ has its realization in the last syllable when it has been
lexicalized as a bisyllabic adjective jehěp.
        The word jehěp can function as an adjective or as a verb, as shown in (70).70) kan          ʔã=jehěp=be
    3SG          3SG=be.bad=REM.PST
    ‘it was bad’         Perhaps the least etymologically transparent of the four adjectives in Kakua
is bɨdǐ ‘big’. However, even when its source is not clear, the fact that it can occur
both as a verb and as a free form (adjective), without the need of the adjectivizer
marker –ni, can serve as a sign to suspect its verbal origin. I acknowledge, however
that it is cross-linguistically common for adjective to share properties with either
nouns or verbs. My argument is based on the large number of descriptive verbs that
in Kakua serve to describe properties of nouns.
         The examples in (71)-(73) below illustrate the adjective bɨdǐ ‘big’ used as an
attributive modifier (with animate and inanimate entities):71) teluʧaʔ               bɨdǐ      ʔĩ=t-bibuʔ-hip=tagǎ

     ‘there was a big house’73) bâkaʔ        bɨdǐ
     body         big
     ‘fat person/big person’       Like some verbs, the adjective bɨdǐ can also function as an adverb. When
functioning as an adverb, bɨdǐ occurs at the beginning of the clause, as in examples
(74) and (75) below, and its semantic meaning is that of ‘very much’:

    very.much 1SG=older.brother=OBJ 1SG=love-count-listen=DECL
    ‘I love and rely on my brother very much’       The main features of the closed class of adjectives can be listed as follows:a) Adjectival concepts in Kakua are generally expressed through descriptive verbs.
b) Attributive modification is expressed by adjectivized verbs, noun compounding
   or noun classification.
c) The adjectivizer suffix is –ni. It can be attached to (descriptive) verb roots to
   form adjectives. When attached to other verb roots (other than descriptive
   verbs), it can also function as agent nominalization.
d) The adjective or adjectivized element has free syntactic order, although normally
   it follows the modified element, it may also precede it.
e) The four adjectives identified in Kakua are items expressing the notions of ‘big’,
   ‘tall/up’, ‘new’, and ‘bad’. These four forms can be used as free forms (as
   attributive concepts or modifiers), or as heads of a predicative construction.
f) The four attested adjectives do not take pronominal prefixes.
g) They share a number of features with verbs and some other features with nouns.
   Unlike nouns, adjectives can take verbal morphology and can be nominalized.
   And unlike verbs, adjectives can take nominal morphology.
h) Adjectives are synchronically monomorphemic, but some are probably
   historically derived3.3.6 Adverbs
        Like in the case for quality or attributive modification, modification of verbs
and clauses in Kakua is mostly expressed by verbs. However, there is a set of words
that are not verbs and that can also serve to modify verbs and clauses. These adverbs
are morphosyntactically different from verbs and nouns.
        Although most members of this set of words have a clear etymological source
in verbs, they can be morphosyntactically distinguished from verbs in that they can
occur as free morphemes, whereas verbs must always occur with additional
inflectional morphology (see Chapter 8 for discussion of the exceptional cases when
verb roots can occur as free morphemes).
         Most adverbs can constitute a sentence on their own, like nouns. Unlike
nouns, however, some adverbs cannot take case marking. Also, unlike nouns,
adverbs can take verbal morphology.
        On the basis of their syntactic behavior adverbs can be divided into two sets.
A set of adverbs that occurs at the beginning of the clause they modify, and a set of
adverbs that occur as particles at the end of the clause that they modify.
122           A Grammar of Kakua       Manner meanings in Kakua, such as ‘quickly’, ‘strongly’, ‘well’, are
expressed by verbs: wajkan=na ‘be.quick=DECL’, wẽp=na ‘be.strong=DECL’,
tɨj=na ‘be.good/be.well=DECL’.
       Kakua adverbs express meanings typical of time adverbs and adverbs of
degree.
       A list of these adverb words is given in Table 3.11 below.","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"
"9.1     Serial verb constructions
       Serial verb constructions (henceforth SVCs) are constructions consisting of
two or more verb roots in sequence such that they represent one single clause. In
such a construction, there should be no other element (grammatical nor lexical) in
between the verb roots.
       Haspelmath (2014) has proposed a series of descriptive generalizations for
SVCs across languages. Loosely following these, I propose in the following list the
defining properties specific to SVCs in Kakua:i)         Components of a SVC in Kakua may not be negated separately .
ii)        Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same tense value and may not be
           given different tense values individually.
iii)       Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same aspectual value and may not
           be given different aspectual values individually.
iv)        Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same mood value and may not be
           given different mood values individually.
v)         Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same evidentiality value and may
           not be given different evidentiality values individually.
vi)        Components of a SVC in Kakua share the same arguments       I proceed now to provide examples in order to illustrate each of these
properties of SVCs in Kakua:i)         Components of a SVC in Kakua may not be negated separately :       The scope of negation in Kakua is the entire clause, and no element smaller
than a clause may be negated. In SVCs then, the scope of negation runs over all
                                                                          Verb serialization           259elements (all verbs and other morphology) within the SVC, rather than over one
single verb of the SVC. See examples (4)-(5) below:14)    měm=diʔ nɨmʔ=héʔ                     ma=hêjʔ-jap-bak-kan=nit

      1SG=HAB-know-talk-NEG
      ‘I don’t know, don’t talk’       If one verb of the construction were to be negated separately, the resulting
interpretation of the utterance changes drastically. Compare (4) above to the elicited
variant in (6) below:6)    měm=diʔ nɨmɁ=héʔ                     ma=hêjʔ-kan                     jap-bak=nit

      ‘they bathed her (it is said)’       Example (7) illustrates the semantically ditransitive verb hɨ ̂t ‘show’. With this
verb also, not all arguments need to be overtly expressed. Here, only two overt
arguments occur: the proclitic for 3SG.M ʔã= referring to the subject argument of
the clause, and the object kǎn=diʔ referring to the indirect object (recipient)
‘shaman’. The direct object (theme), tɨb ‘pain’, is dropped since it had been
previously established in the discourse:7)    kǎn=diʔ             hɨ ̂dɁɨ=ka         ʔã=t-beh=tagǎ
      3SG.M=OBJ            show=ASS         3SG.M= EVID-go=INF.EVID
      ‘perhaps he went to show (his pain) to him (the shaman)’        As discussed in Chapter 8, Kakua does not mark subject arguments with
morphological case, but rather they are indexed on the verb. Other arguments
(objects), receive the case marker =diʔ ‘OBJ’. The marking of case for object
arguments, however, is governed by differential object marking rules (c.f., §8.3), and
thus, some arguments that function as objects may lack case markers. Therefore, the
presence or absence of object case markers on arguments is not a reliable indicator
of the transitivity of the root. Example (8) illustrates the verb ‘eat’ hěmʔ, where the
object argument is not morphologically marked for case, which is one of the formal
cues that help identify the valency of verb roots, here camouflaged by the absence
of such marker on the object argument:8)    Katerine    tʃɨ ̂              mi=hěmʔ=na=ka
      Katherine pineapple            3SG.F=eat=DECL=ASS
      ‘Katherine eats pineapple’       As seen in the examples above, defining transitivity values of Kakua verbs is
complicated by the omission of arguments, on the one hand, and optionality of case
marking, on the other hand. Intransitive verbs can thus be identified as those that can
maximally take one (subject) argument, and no object arguments, while mono- and
ditransitive verbs can be identified as those that can take one or two object
arguments, keeping in mind that these do not need to be overtly expressed, and if
they are, they do not need to be marked for object case. Given the possible omission
                                                    The verb: morphology and structure                239of object arguments, mono- and ditransitive verbs can also be called ambitransitives,
i.e. verbs that may behave both like intransitive and transitive verbs.","[260, 261]"

with the inferred evidential marker =ta in either remote or recent past tenses.

This reported enclitic has a clear etymological source in the Kakua verb wɨt
‘command’ (see comments on this at the end of Chapter 8). This clitic is also used
when quoting someone or in narratives such as mythological stories which are
regarded as events that did occur but were experienced by people who told them to
someone else. It is also used when the original source of the information is unknown,
or unavailable, but nevertheless the information is not regarded as imaginary.109) manji                  tɨ ̃̂b-ɨp=wɨt=hĩ

10.6.6 Getting the right evidential marker
        It is noteworthy that there is a strong awareness among Kakua speakers about
using the ‘correct’ evidential marking for each situation. The following episode that
occurred during my fieldwork illustrates how important evidential marking is in
Kakua speech. The following example comes from a conversation after watching a
documentary movie about the Nɨkak. Here the speaker is telling what he saw the
night before in the movie. Since this was a movie, choosing the correct evidential
marker is non-trivial, especially because the speaker himself had seen the Nɨkak
people before when they were brought to the Kakua village in the late 1980s. Thus,
he appears to have regarded the images in the movie as projections of situations in
the real world. However, a movie, or a photographic image, is not regarded as a
direct visual experience, but as information experienced through some other sensorial
means. The speaker hesitated on what evidential marker he should use, and, as seen
in the example below, he repeats the same predicate ( ʔĩ-t=jǎk-bâbʔ-bâbʔ=hĩ
3PL=EVID-cook-drink-drink=REM.PST ‘they cooked and drank’) various times until
he finally decides that expressing the proposition as visually experienced, without
any formal marking, is the most accurate way to tell his version of the story. The
text continued with the speaker only using the visual (unmarked) form.

2.2    Syllable structure
2.2.0 General description: syllable
        The preferred syllable structure in Kakua is CVC. Most of Kakua’s
morphemes are monosyllabic (84% of the word list used for this work). Syllables
without an onset occur only in V-initial affixes.
        Though at a lower rate, open syllables (CV) are also encountered. In word-
final position, however, these open syllables undergo phonetic vowel lengthening,
forming heavy syllables [CV:].
        The process of phonetic vowel lengthening, together with Kakua’s preferred
CVC syllabic structure, seeks to produce heavy syllables as the ideal prototype of
syllabic structure (as the hierarchy below shows).
        The syllabic weight can be understood in terms of a continuum favoring CVC
syllables, and whenever an open syllable cannot be avoided, then phonetic vowel
lengthening provides extra weight to the surface structure. Virtually, this continuum
will gradually become flexible in order to include less preferred structures until
finally reaching the less heavy syllabic structure:         CVC > CV: > CV > VC > V
         /CVC/                     includes: content word roots, affixes, clitics
         /CV/ (and [CV:]) includes: content word roots, affixes, clitics
         /VC/                      includes: V-initial affixes
         /V/                       includes affixes       In mono- and bisyllabic loans involving root-final open syllables, the CVC
structure is adopted whenever possible, demonstrating a preference for the CVC
syllabic pattern. In borrowings with open syllables, by default the glottal stop /ʔ/ is
                                                                                  Phonology 65epenthesized in the coda position of the final syllable of the word. Speakers of Kakua
speaking Spanish usually transfer the CVC pattern to Spanish:        Spanish                  Kakua
        [si]                     [tiʔ]                              ‘yes’

        [me.sa]                  [me.saʔ-paʔa]                      ‘table-cl.flat’

default epenthetic consonant as a strategy to increase syllable weight, forming an
ideal heavy CVC syllable, whether epenthesized in onset or in coda position.
       Vowel-initial suffixes do not insert any epenthetic consonant at the
syllable/morpheme boundary even when the morpheme to which the suffix attaches
is an open-syllable morpheme: CV-VC. This shows evidence that these V-initial
suffixes do not have empty consonant slots. Some of these V-initial suffixes do have
unspecified vowel slots (e.g. past marker -Vp) in which cases the vowel in the suffix
copies the vowel quality of the root to which the suffix is bound.","[86, 87]"

12.10 Interrogative clauses
12.10.0 Interrogative clauses
        Kakua has two main types of interrogative clauses: Content (or question-
word) interrogative clauses, and polar (yes-no) interrogative clauses. Content
questions (§12.10.2 below) are formed by using interrogative pronouns or other
interrogative words like interrogative demonstratives and/or adverbials (see Chapter
7 on interrogative pronouns and question words). Polar interrogative clauses
(§12.10.1 below), on the other hand, are morphologically marked by the clitic =nit.
Interrogative clauses contrast with declarative clauses in that the declarative marker
=na does not occur in interrogative clauses. They do not differ from declarative
clauses in word order. Also no particular intonational pattern is required to
exclusively mark interrogative clauses (although in future work intonation patterns
in interrogative clauses should be looked at carefully).. Interrogative clauses can be
both affirmative and negative. When negative, the verbal predicate must be marked
by the negation suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’, or the negative existential wîɁikan ‘not.exist’
is used. Compare the following examples:54) wã=ʔip    ma-=hiʔ̃́            ʔã=hɨm=nit=be
    1SG=father 2SG=COM              3SG.M=be/exist=INTERR=REC.PST

    ‘what do you not know?’       Interrogative clauses differ further from declarative clauses (§12.9 above) in
that interrogative clauses have not been found to occur with the entire range of
evidentiality distinctions (I have found them occuring only with the inferred
evidential markers). Further research should focus on specifically testing for
acceptance of each of the evidential markers in interrogative clauses and explore the
reasons why some (at least the inferred category) are allowed to occur whereas other
categories are not. Examples (55) above and (58) below illustrate interrogative
clauses occurring with the inferred evidential. It is interesting to note that evidential
markers can occur in interrogative clauses, even though one might think that
evidential marking presupposes assertion.
       Additionally, the interrogative marker can also co-occur with the dubitative
mood suffix -hi ‘DUB’ in the same clause, as illustrated in (60) below. See Chapter
10 for further descriptions of interaction of the interrogative mood with evidentiality
and other mood markers.58) měm       ma=ta-naʔa-beh=ta=nit
    2SG        2SG=EVID-want-go=INF.EVID=INTERR
    ‘maybe you want to go?’       Polar interrogative clauses and content interrogative clauses differ in that
polar questions must obligatorily be marked with the interrogative mood clitic =nit,
while in interrogative clauses formed with question words, the presence of = nit is
optional, and it is most often omitted.","[348, 349]"

nouns. Positions 6 onwards are filled by enclitics that are not exclusive to the noun
word, and can be added to other parts of speech. These enclitics, which are not part
of the noun grammatical word, are presented below since they represent a part of the
phonological word for nouns. They are presented here to show the order in which
each of these enclitics attach to the nouns.1
Position 6: Case markers
        Case markers in Kakua are enclitics that indicate object case, locative case,
and comitative/instrumental case. Case marking and grammatical relations are
described in Chapter 6. The identity of case markers as clitics is discussed in Chapter
3, section §3.1.2. Examples of case markers in the noun phrase are given below:25) kǎn        hiw-wã=diʔ                             ɲɨn=na

"3.1    Overview of types of morphemes
3.1.0 Overview of the morphosyntactic characteristics of the types of morphemes
         This section summarizes the main characteristics of the different types of
morphemes in Kakua.
         Syntactically, morphemes in Kakua can be divided into two basic types of
morphemes: free morphemes and bound morphemes.
         Free morphemes are monomorphemic roots, which may represent nouns,
adjectives, adverbs, or particles. Verbs, on the other hand, cannot occur as free
morphemes (exceptions to this are discussed in Chapter 8 where a full description of
Kakua’s verbal morphology is given).
         Bound morphemes can be subdivided into three types: i) roots, ii) affixes, and
iii) clitics. Bound roots have lexical semantic content, whereas formatives (affixes
and clitics) tend to have a more abstract grammatical content. Some formatives,
nonetheless, have a clear lexical source from which a grammatical function has been
derived, and both the semantic meaning and the grammatical function can still be
identified.
         Most of the grammatical morphology in Kakua occurs after the stem. Thus,
the set of suffixes and enclitics is larger than the set of prefixes and proclitics.
         Affixes can be further subdivided into inflectional and derivational affixes.
Derivational affixes are optional whereas inflectional affixes are obligatory.
         A list of the different types of morphemes in Kakua is seen in Table 3.1
below:

function as heads of phrases. Those morphemes that can function as head of phrases
are understood as words, whereas affixes and clitics form the set of formatives in
Kakua. The morphosyntactic characteristics of these formatives are described in
§3.1.2 below.
       The semantics and morphosyntax of the different word classes in Kakua are
described in §3.2 and §3.3 of this chapter.","[118, 119]"

3.3.1 Pronouns
       In this section I describe the pronominal paradigm in Kakua. This section is
intended as an overview only; for a detailed description and discussion of Kakua’s
pronominal forms and the pronominal system see Chapter 7.
       Kakua has distinct forms for free and bound personal pronouns. Free
pronouns can function as arguments without the need for extra affixes. The bound
pronouns (proclitics) always precede a noun or verb. When cliticized to nouns, the
bound pronouns express possessors. When cliticized to verbs, the bound pronouns
function as cross-referencing proclitics of the subject argument of the clause. Unlike
the free pronouns, bound pronouns do not have tone specification by default and
instead their tone value is assigned by the elements following the bound pronoun.
       Pronouns functioning as subject or object arguments of a clause take case
markers.

(first, second or third person). Gender distinction in Kakua is specified only for third
person singular.
         The Kakua pronouns are summarized in Table 3.5 and discussed in detail in
Chapter 7.","[132, 133]"

                                                    ‘fish poison’        In Table 2.1, showing Kakua’s vowel inventory, a back mid vowel /o/ is
included as a marginal phoneme. In a previous version of the analisis of Kakua, /o/
was treated as a marginal sound, occurring only in a limited number of words, as
listed in (1) below. For the words listed below, speakers of Kakua in Wacará did not
accept variations with [u]. This might indicate that /o/ occurs only in restricted
contexts, namely when /o/ is followed by /a/, as in (1a, 1c, and 1e). This, however,
does not account for the cases shown in (1b and 1d). 1d and 1e are very likely to be
loans into Kakua (see below), which have adapted fully to the phonology of Kakua.
The list presented below is not an exhaustive list of the words with /o/ in Wacará’s
Kakua (see additional words in (6)), but there is no reason to believe that it is not
representive. A study dedicated to the status of /o/ for Kakua speakers of Wacará,
and comparison with speakers from Nuevo Pueblo is needed to further clarify this
aspect of synchronic phonology of Kakua. Finally, note that speakers of Nuevo
Pueblo also pronounced the words in the list in (1) below as [o]:1)     a. /hòa/                      ‘downriver’
       b. /~jakoʔ/                    ‘crab’
       c. /-ʧôa/                     ‘nail’
       d. /horaʔ/                     ‘banana’
                                                                                      Phonology 25      e. /koatá/                ‘white fronted spider monkey’ (Ateles belzebuth sp)2        Examples in (2) show that the word for banana, listed in 1d above, is a very
likely a borrowed word in Kakua:2) Kakua                        Wanano                Tuyuca                 English

opportunity to compare some words between the Kakua varieties spoken in Wacará
and the varieties spoken in Nuevo Pueblo in order to check for the status of this [o]
sound. As a result, I propose that the [o] sound in fact occurs only marginally in the
dialects of Kakua spoken in the village of Wacará (in limited contexts perhaps, see
comment for the list of words in (1) above), while being attested for the Kakua
varieties spoken in the village of Nuevo Pueblo. Examples are given in (3) below:3) Wacará                                  Nuevo Pueblo
   a. tù̃ĵ                               tò̃ĵ                            ‘type of bitter manioc’
   b. mǔp                                 mǒp                              ‘to rot’
   c. hũp                                 hõp                              ‘to dry’

varieties spoken in Nuevo Pueblo, is not assessed here. The data gathered was not
sufficient as to show contrastive distribution. Instead, what it shows is that every
instance of the [o] sound in Nuevo Pueblo, corresponded to [u] in the varieties spoken
in Wacará.3 Nonetheless, it must be stated that not every instance of [u] in Wacará
corresponded to [o] in Nuevo Pueblo, as shown in the following list:4) Wacará                                  Nuevo Pueblo

were found, and are shown in (5) below:

         ‘to pack’                                   ‘be happy’        For the Kakua varieties of Wacará, mûmuʔ serves to express both ‘to plant
big seeds’ and ‘type of champignon’. Only context can disambiguate the meaning of
this word. Also in Wacará, while ʔâmuʔ means ‘to pack’ or ‘organize inside a
container’, the word expressing ‘be happy’ is wè̃j̀ . Both ʔâmuʔ and wè̃j̀ were accepted
for the Kakua speakers of Nuevo Pueblo as words meaning ‘be happy’. I have not
tested for whether or not a similar word with similar semantics is found in the
surrounding languages of the area to infer a borrowing into Kakua.
        Based on the contrasts presented above only, I propose, with reservations, that
Kakua had /o/ as a contrastive sound that was lost as a contrast and became
neutralized into one phonemic sound in the dialects spoken in Wacará, while
remaining two different contrastive sounds in the Kakua dialects spoken in Nuevo
Pueblo.4 The data in hand, however, are not sufficient to support this hypothesis and
future dialectal studies are needed in order to have more evidence against or in favor
of this hypothesis.5
        For the moment being, the data at hand only supports the vowel inventory
shown in Table 2.1 above for the Kakua varieties spoken in Wacará, where the back
mid vowel [o] will be considered a marginal phoneme.
        A phonological inventory for the vowels of Kakua dialects spoken in Nuevo
Pueblo is given in Table 2.4 below.","[44, 45, 46, 47, 48]"

12.9   Declarative clauses
        Declarative clauses in Kakua are those expressing statements (in the sense of
Palmer 2001:65). Declarative clauses are morphologically marked by the clitic =na.
Note, however, that in many cases the declarative marker does not occur. The criteria
predicting the omission, or facultative marking, of the declarative clitic, are left for
future research.
        From a formal perspective declarative clauses do not have special
phonological features (like, for example, dedicated intonation, or other phonological
traits to be found exclusively in declarative clauses) nor do they have a special
constituent order. Declarative clauses can express affirmative or negative statements,
as seen in the examples in (48)-(49) below:48) kǎn=diʔ             ʔɨbʔ                wã=bèw=na=hĩ

clauses in Kakua (complement, relative and adverbial clauses), the following
subsection, §13.3, focuses on the description of markers of switch reference in
Kakua, which play important roles in both main and subordinate clauses. A
subsection discussing bare verb roots, as introductory elements to subordinate
clauses, is given in §13.4. Finally, descriptions of complement clauses, relative
clauses, and adverbial clauses are given in §13.5, §13.6, and §13.7 respectively.
Causal constructions, which involve the use of a finite verb (and perhaps more
recently the repetition of a bare verb as a linking strategy to express causation), are
decribed in §13.8.
352 A Grammar of Kakua13.3 Switch reference markers
13.3.0 Introduction
        Kakua has two clitics which may indicate the maintenance or switch of
subject referents across clauses. These markers are not obligatory. However, the
criteria conditioning their occurrence have not yet been explored. They also have
some exceptional uses which likewise have not been explored in detail yet. Therefore
the description provided in the following sections must be regarded as preliminary.
These clitics are used both in main and subordinate clauses. The forms, also given
in Table 13.1 above, are: different subject =tʃaʔ ‘D.S’, and same subject =nit ‘S.S’.4
These clitics attach not only to verbs, but to other parts of speech as well (e.g.,
pronouns (15) below). Likewise, switch reference clitics in Kakua are not restricted
to subordinate clauses, as they occur also in combination with main clauses (see
examples below). These switch reference markers can be used to mark adverbial
clauses. Such an adverbial use of the switch reference markers seems to be, according
to van Gijn et al. (2011:8ff), a common strategy in South American languages. The
present section aims to show the semantics of the switch reference markers, and does
not particularly focus on the adverbial uses of these markers.","[372, 373]"
"        The following examples show some of the problematic cases which have not
yet been fully analyzed. These have to do with 1) the element to which the switch
reference marker attaches, and 2) whether the switch reference clitic may occur more
than once within the same clause, and if so, what the factors triggering the occurrence
of this marker (or its complete absence) are. To illustrate a case in which the switch
reference clitic occurs twice in the same clause, an example is given in (17) below:17) ʔĩ=babʔ-át=tʃãʔ                mɨn=ɨ ̃́p=tʃãʔ
    3PL=drink-NMLZ=D.S                chat=PST=D.S    ʔã=tá-tɨj-hǔj-têw-tʃɨd-beʔ-hɨ ̀d-ɨp=tagǎ

    ‘[while they were drinking and chatting] he (bumblebee) should’ve been sitting,
    listening and working and showing’       The following example illustrates a case in which the switch reference clitic
is used but the subject of the following clause is not different from the subject of the
preceding clause. Rather, it is found in the clause in which the switch of reference
occurs, as in (18), where it attaches to the noun kãk ‘person’, and this ‘person’ is
the one being extinguished, different from the subject of the preceding clause
‘mothers’. Note that in (18) the different subject marker is attached to a noun,
showing it satisfies the ‘freedom of host selection’ criterion of clitics. Also, the same
example (18) shows that, although switch reference markers can serve as
subordinators, they are better defined as markers that serve to combine clauses,
whether these are dependent on one another or not.18) bɨ        ma=mâ=na                    wîʔi-kan=ka         ma=mâ=na

                As is the case for the different subject marker described in 13.3.1, the syntactic distribution of
the same subject clitic occurs in the majority of cases, preceding the clause that it introduces. See however,
examples such as (22) below, where the same subject clitic occurs in the last clause.
                                                                                Complex Clauses           355       As in the case of the different subject clitic, the same subject clitic can attach
to elements other than verbs. This is illustrated below (see also (15) above, where
the same subject clitic occurs on a pronoun):723) [tɨ ̀jpeʔ=nit]=be   nɨwá           měm                          kǎn=diʔ

     ‘Finally granddad! you bring him!, to your relative’       In summary, there are two clitics in Kakua that often seem to indicate a
change or maintenance of the subject across clauses, be these combinations of
independent clauses or combinations of independent and subordinate clauses. Note
that example (20) also involves the repetition of the verb and the object of the
preceding clause, as a strategy to temporally link independent clauses among
themselves. This strategy, described for many languages as tail-head linkage, is
presented in the following subsection.8
       Some questions regarding switch reference markers that should be undertaken
in future research are: What conditions the syntactic position of switch reference
markers? What are the semantic, discourse, syntactic or pragmatic environments that
favors the occurrence of switch reference markers? Are the conditions regarding
their occurrence in main clauses different from the once governing their occurrence
in subordinate clauses?","[374, 375, 376]"

334    A Grammar of Kakua12.10.3 Responding to interrogatives
       Content questions are typically answered with a (declarative) clause, or with
a single word that provides the particular information solicited.
       Polar (yes-no) questions can be responded to positively in two ways: with the
                       ̃̂ ‘yes, aha’ (84)-(85) or by repeating in a declarative form the
affirmative particle hɨhɨ
verb phrase that appeared in the interrogative (86)-(87). Subjects are frequently
dropped, as in (84) and (86).","[352, 353, 354, 355]"
"
          Position 1: Proclitics
        Kakua (virtually always) indexes the subject argument of the clause by means
of cross-referencing proclitics (see Chapter 6 for description of subject indexing on
the verb and exceptions to its obligatoriness, and Chapter 11 on alignment). These
proclitics agree in number and person with the subject argument of the clause, and
also in gender for 3rd person singular subjects (often no overt subject NP is needed).
Example in (17) below illustrates the use of a 1st person singular subject proclitic
with no overt subject noun phrase:17) baj-ni-bit            wã=hêjʔ
    be.small-ADJVZ-DIM 1SG=know
    ‘I know a little bit’
         Position 2: Prefixes: evidentiality
       Prefixes encoding evidential and aspectual meanings occur in the second slot
of the verb word. These prefixes cannot occur without a preceding proclitic. One of
these second position prefixes t-/ti- encodes secondhand evidentiality, expressing
                                           The verb: morphology and structure          247that the statement was not sensed, directly heard, or witnessed by the speaker. This
evidential prefix often occurs together with the reported evidential enclitic in the
same word (see Chapter 10 for the description of evidentiality in Kakua). An example
is given in (18):18) tʃèj kãk  ʔã=ti-beh-ep=wɨt=hĩ                     hunhatiʔ
    night       person 3SG.M=EVID-go-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST LONG.AGO
    ‘Long ago, a person went out at night (it is said)’       Other meanings that are expressed by prefixes occurring in this slot are:
inferred evidentiality t-/ta-, as illustrated in (19) and (20); habitual aspect, as in (21);
and non-visual evidentiality (see examples in Section §10.6).        ̂ ã=diʔ

    burn=OBJ           3SG.M= EVID -go-DUB=INF.EVID
    ‘He might have gone to burn (ants)’20) ket         ʔĩ=t-têw-ep=tâ=be                      wǎpʧî=na=diʔ

    ‘They worked their manioc fields (it seems)’21) wěm=heʔ             ʔĩ=pĩ-nawʔ-kan=be                wěm=diʔ
    1SG=INTENS          3PL=HAB-tell-NEG=REC.PST           1SG=OBJ
     ‘They didn’t tell me’ (I assume since they usually don't tell me)
         Position 3: Prefix: reciprocal and reflexive
       Position 3 can be filled only with the reflexive/reciprocal prefix mǐk-. This
reflexive/reciprocal prefix can fill the pre-stem position required by verb words
without needing to be preceded by a proclitic. Example (22) below illustrates the
reflexive/reciprocal prefix being preceded by a proclitic (position 1) and an inferred
evidential prefix (position 2):22) ʔĩ=t-mǐk-pâʔ-ap=hĩ
    3PL=INF.EVID-RFLX/REC-break.in.half-PST=REM.PST
    ‘They broke themselves apart’ (they took different paths by themselves)       The prefix mǐk- ‘RFLX/REC’ in Kakua is the only morpheme that changes the
valency of the verb to which it attaches. It serves to encode both reflexive and
reciprocal meanings. These are illustrated in (23) for the reciprocal meaning, and
(24) for the reflexive meaning of the prefix:
248    A Grammar of Kakua23) fĩ=mǐk-fwãʔ=na=ka                      ʔinwɨʔá

    1PL= RFLX/REC-find=DECL=ASS               relative.VOC
    ‘We meet each other, my relative!’24) mâ-dǔbʔ=hĩʔ          mi=t-mík-pũj-ũp=wɨt=be
    tree-CL:pointed=COM 3SG.F=EVID-RFLX-hit/whip-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
    ‘she whipped herself with a vein (it’s said)’       Whether this prefix expresses reciprocal or reflexive depends on the context.
With a singular subject, as in example (25) (see also example (24)), a reciprocal
reading is not possible. Verbs with plural subjects, as in (26), on the other hand, can
have either a reciprocal or a reflexive meaning. The context determines the
interpretation as either one or the other:25) kǎn=héʔ              ʔã=mík-bûd
    3SG.M=EMPH             3SG.M=RFLX-cut
    ‘he cut himself’26) kět         ʔĩ=t-mík-bûd=be
    3PL         3PL=EVID-RECIP-cut=REC.PST
    ‘they cut each other’ or ‘they cut themselves’        Verbs that include the reflexive/reciprocal prefix can drop the subject proclitic
if reference is sufficiently clear from the context, like with other verb forms. This is
illustrated in (27) below:27) victor-ĩʔ             mɨ=bǔ=hĩ                    fĩ=hɨm-ɨp=hĩ
    Victor-POSS            house=LOC=REM.PST             1PL=exist-PST=REM.PST      mik-wěʔe=na                    fĩ=tʃãhãp=hĩ
      REFL/RECIP-chat=DECL         1PL=PROG=REM.PST
      ‘we were at Victor’s house, chatting (among ourselves)’       Additionally, the reflexive/reciprocal prefix can have a use different from the
encoding of reciprocal or reflexive meaning. Instead, it can have an intensifying use,
similar to ‘self’ in English. This is illustrated in the following example:28) ma=mǐk-wẽp-hâ=na
    2SG=RFLX/RECIP-be.strong-wake.up=DECL
    ‘eat your breakfast yourself’
      Position 5: Suffixes: imperatives
      Position 5 can be filled by affirmative imperative -V́, the negative imperative
-kabuhú, and the imperative on the benefit of someone else -Ɂabuhú. The different
                                           The verb: morphology and structure          249imperative suffixes in this slot cannot co-occur. Examples in (29) and (30) illustrate
verbs inflected for imperative mood (for more examples of imperatives, including
the imperative for the benefit of someone else, see Chapter 12):29) ma=jàp-ʧɨ ̂jʔ-beh-é
    2SG=pass-step.on-go-IMP
    ‘walkǃ’30) ma=tîw-kabuhú
    2SG=play-NEG.IMP
    ‘Don’t play!’        Note that both the imperative and the negative imperative suffixes occur in
final position in the examples presented above. I do not have evidence in my corpus
to tell whether these suffixes can occur together with other suffixes or if their position
is later within the template.","[268, 269, 270, 271]"

to the slot within the verb word and can occur in different slots depending on the
type of clause. This is the case for the frustrative marker -jɨʔ / =jɨʔ. When the clause
is declarative without being marked for reported evidentiality, the frustrative marker
occurs preceding the declarative marker as shown in example (14) below (which is
why it is listed in position 10 in Table 8.4 above). When the clause is marked for
reported evidentiality, the frustrative marker cannot occur preceding the reported
evidential marker =wɨt; rather, it must follow the marker as illustrated in (15) below,
and it functions as a clitic and not as a suffix (which is why it is given also as an
enclitic in position 13 on Table 8.4 above).

intransitive and transitive constructions.

referenced on the verb by the proclitic ʔã = ‘3SG’. In the transitive clauses in (2)
and (3) the subject argument is a free pronoun and the cross-referencing proclitic on
the predicate of the clause agrees in person and number with the subject pronoun. In
(4) and (5) the subject is not expressed by a noun phrase, but the proclitic on the
verb alone expresses the subject argument of the clause:1) bɨ                      ̃̌ ʔ=na=ka

   ‘I will weed off my manioc field’        Subject indexing on the verb, however, can also be omitted under specific
semantic and discourse conditions, related to animacy, definiteness, and if the
argument can be recuperated from the discourse.
        The omission of cross-referencing morphology due to semantic criteria seems
to be typologically common (c.f., Givón 1979; Lambrecht 1994, Comrie 1989, Croft
2003, Iemmolo 2011).
        In Kakua, if the subject argument of a clause can be recuperated from the
discourse context, cross-referencing proclitics are not obligatory, and thus may be
omitted.
        Example (6) below illustrates one such case. This example is taken from a
conversation in which the speaker producing the text was commenting on the time
when a group of Nɨkak people were brought to the Kakua village in Wacará in the
early 90’s. At the beginning of the conversation it was established that the Nɨkak
people came, as illustrated in (6):6) nùtkãk-wã         ̃̌ ʔ=na=hi
                  ʔĩ=hɨw                            kět

     forest=LOC          go=DECL
     ‘the Nɨkak came, they went to the forest’        Following the statement in (6), the speaker moves on to comment on the
various different activities that the Nɨkak people did while in Wacará. Note that the
first predicate in (6) is marked with the cross-referencing proclitic ʔĩ= ‘3PL’
186         A Grammar of Kakua(highlighted in boldface) in agreement with the subject argument nùtkãkwã1 ‘Nɨkak’.
The second predicate in (6) and the predicates in (7) below, mâw ‘kill’ and nǎwʔ
‘tell’, have the same argument nùtkãkwã ‘Nɨkak’, but they do not have the expected
cross-referencing proclitic ʔĩ= ‘3PL’. I have highlighted in boldface these predicates
which should be expected to carry the cross-referencing proclitic:7) nɨɲɨp-wã=diʔ                  ʔâka-wã=diʔ                           mâwa=ta=be

      ‘They killed animals (it seemed), they told of three, two (animals) they'd killed
      (it seemed)’        Examples (8)-(9) below provide another illustration in which the subject
argument can be recovered from discourse and thus cross-referencing proclitics can
be omitted. These examples come from a narrative in which the speaker starts out
by establishing that one day he went out to look for food (8); then the speaker
continues to tell the different activities that he did while looking for food. Note that
once the speaker has established who the main topic of the story is, cross-referencing
proclitics are omitted in the other verb constructions (9).8) hěmʔ-at           wîɁi-kan            nin        tɨh-ʧû-ɲah-ni=diʔ

            The conventional ethnonym Nɨkak here presented as nùtkãkwã, was considered by other
speakers as a mispronounciation of the ethnonym nɨkkãkwã, literally ‘language-person-PL’.
                                               Argument marking and case marking 187        Related to the recoverability from discourse, subject cross-referencing
proclitics are most often omitted when the subject argument is higher in animacy
than the object(s) argument(s) of the clause, which is when it is also most likely to
be the topic and thus recoverable from discourse. Example (10) below illustrates the
description of an event performed by a first person subject wěm ‘1SG’ which is
higher in animacy (according to Kakua’s animacy scale) than the object argument
wɨw ‘caiman’. The actions of ‘pulling upwards and leave’ expressed by the
constructions waj-ʧej-féh ‘pull-turn.upwards-leave', and waj-ʔǎbm-beh-dʒuʔ ‘pull-
go.up-go-toss’ are being performed by the same first person subject, expressed by
wěm ‘1SG’, onto the patient, expressed by wɨw ‘caiman’. Note that the expected
cross-referencing proclitic wã= ‘1SG’ is omitted on both serial verb constructions
(highlighted in boldface):10) dâ           wěm        mâw-ap,            panit-pêa         wɨw=diʔ
    there!        1SG         kill-PST,           like.this-finish   caiman=OBJ    waj-ʧej-féh                           waj-ʔǎb-beh-jùʔ=hĩ=buh
    pull-turn.upwards-leave           pull-go.up-go-toss=REM.PST=DIR
    ‘There! I killed (it), and so like this (I) pulled the caiman upwards and left it, (I)
    pulled him up and tossed him’       Another situation in which the cross-referencing proclitics are often omitted
is when the predicate is being repeated as a strategy of clause linking in Kakua.
Example (11), taken from a conversation, illustrates this. In this example, the speaker
is commenting on the time when the Nɨkak people came to Wacará (mentioned in
example (6)-(7) above). Here, the various actions in the event are performed by one
and the same participant (the Nɨkak people), and this is marked with the same subject
clitic =nit ‘S.S’; thus, the proclitic ʔĩ= ‘3PL’ referring to a previously mentioned
subject (Nɨkak), is omitted. The predicates highlighted in boldface are those for
which subject cross-referencing proclitics have been omitted. The ones which
include the same subject clitic =nit are the ones that are involved in clause linking.11) ʔĩ=t-hɨm-ɨp=ta=be,             panʔĩʔ                          hɨw̃̌ ʔ=nit=hĩ

188             A Grammar of Kakua        To, summarize, subject arguments are never marked with case markers 2 and
proclitics on the verb index the subject argument of the clause. These proclitics agree
in person and number with the subject argument (and gender for 3 rd person singular
arguments). Subject cross-reference proclitics are often omitted in the following
situations:      (i)             The referent of the subject argument has been previously established
                      and can be recuperated from discourse.
      (ii)            The subject argument is higher in animacy than the other argument(s)
                      of the clause.

      A basic locative construction (or BLC), as defined in Levinson and Wilkins
(2006:15), is a type of construction that predominantly “occurs in response to a
Where-question”. There are two different options for expressing locative relations in
324     A Grammar of KakuaKakua. One is by means of the locative clitic =bǔ,1 the other by means of positional
verbs (of which Kakua has an extensive set). This section describes these two types
of basic locative construction. Further information on the locative marker =bǔ and
its functions is found in Chapter 6 on grammatical relations and case marking.
Chapter 8 provides more information on the semantics of positional verbs in the
context of the description of Kakua verbs.
        The locative marker =bǔ serves to express a variety of locative meanings,
among them allative ‘to/into’ and ablative ‘from’. Positional verbs cover inessive
‘in’, and adessive ‘on’ locative meanings. Examples (40)-(45) below illustrate the
stative locative, and the allative and ablative locative meanings expressed by the
locative clitic =bǔ :240) nun=bǔ               ʔã=wǎw                       hɨm-lah=na

    ‘(it) blossomed on/from both sides’

            Note that =bǔ also serves as an emphasis marker; see §8.4 for a description of this clitic.
        2
            Note the co-occurrence of the locative and the object marker in example (44), suggesting that
maybe the morpheme analyzed as object marker in this book might have some other functions (marking
adjuncts as well as object arguments, for example). See the discussion on this topic in Chapter 6.
                                    Basic clause structure and types of clauses      325        The locative enclitic, as illustrated in the examples above, attaches to the head
noun of the locative NP. The locative-marked NP tends to occur in initial position
(preceding core arguments). However, it can also be seen in the examples above
(e.g., (41) and (44) that an alternative placement of the locative adjunct is possible).
        A second set of constructions expressing locative meanings are those
involving a positional verb, in which the verb specifies the location/position of the
nominal. This verb often appears as part of a serial verb construction (see Chapter
9). Constructions of this type do not require the locative marker =bǔ. Examples are
given in (46)-(47) below:46) tɨh-daʔ-beʔ
    turtle.sp-CL:round-AUG    ʔã=pẫʔ-ʧêw-dǔdʔ-feh=na

    ‘all set, I have killed (it), he (the caiman) is laying on (the fire) facing upwards’       Table §12.1 below gives some examples of positional verbs. A list of
positional verbs can be found in Chapter 8. Note that these verbs express inessive
and adessive locative meanings not expressed by the locative clitic case marker =bǔ.","[344, 345, 346]"

to avoid /l/ in final position. Nonetheless, I do not have evidence to claim that this
has indeed been the process in Kakua since there are also examples of borrowings
from Cubeo that already have the epenthesized form, suggesting that it was already
a Cubeo process when it came into Kakua (see more description in Section §2.3):

is interesting to note that it has been reported that Nɨkak, Kakua’s sister language,
has a flap [ɾ] consonant in its phonemic inventory (see Cabrera et al. 1999:369). On
the other hand, /l/ is not found as a phoneme in any other of the Vaupés languages
(see Barnes 1999 and Chacon 2009 for Eastern Tukanoan; Epps 2005 for Hup;
Ospina 2002 for Yuhup). To my knowledge, lateral phonemes in languages spoken
in the Vaupés area have been documented for Tariana only, and even there it also
seems to be a restricted phoneme with limited occurrences (Aikhenvald 2003:29-30).","[72, 73]"

10.4 Illocution
10.4.0 Introduction
        Illocution refers to a semantic subgroup of mood markers that function to
express the communicative intention with which the speaker presents a proposition.
As such, the communicative status of the proposition in Kakua can be that of an
assertion, a question, or a command. This section deals with these three basic
illocution markers, namely declarative (§10.4.1), interrogative (§10.4.2), and
imperative (§10.4.3).
        The markers of illocution are presented here only briefly in order to illustrate
their semantics. This is because these markers have a formal distinction as well as a
semantic one: they have the ability to form clause types (clause types are described       5
           A formal description of illocution marking is presented in Chapter 12 (clause types).
282   A Grammar of Kakuain Chapter 12, sections §12.9, §12.10, and §12.11 for declarative, interrogative, and
imperative clauses respectively. Negation is also described in Chapter 12).
       In the characterization of the morphological markers of illocution, Hengeveld
notes that “by their very nature, basic illocutions [this is declarative, interrogative
and imperative, KB] are restricted to independent sentences and quotations. This
feature will be of help in distinguishing illocutionary from modal categories”
(Hengeveld 2004:1191). This is, however, not a characteristic of the morphological
markers of illocution in Kakua, for these markers are not restricted to independent
clauses and may occur in subordinate clauses (see example (47) below, and Chapter
13, for examples of declarative marker occurring in subordinated clauses).
       The different markers of illocution mood in Kakua are summarized in Table
10.3 below.","[302, 303]"

13.4 Bare verb roots as clause linkers: tail-head linkage       In addition to the switch reference markers presented in §13.3 above, Kakua
uses repetition of bare verb roots as a strategy to link clauses, in a system of ‘tail-
head linkage’9 (c.f., Hopper 1979, Stirling 1993, Thompson et al. 2007; also Givón
2001: 347). Tail-head linkage, as described previously for other languages, consists
of connecting (groups of) sentences or clauses by partially or completely repeating
the predicate of the last element of the linked clauses or sentences (the ‘tail’) at the
         7
             Note also that, as in the case of the different subject marker, the same subject marker in example
(15) and (23) above is cliticized onto an element of the main clause. Thus, this same subject marker should
not be described as a marker of subordination, rather, it can be more accurately described as a marker
that serves to combine clauses.
         8
             Note however that the repetition of the object argument is not a usual characteristic of tail-head
linkage strategies.
         9
              Other terms used are ‘linkage’, ‘head-tail linkage’, ‘recapitulative linkage’, ‘tail-head
recapitulation’ (c.f., Guillaume 2011:109 ff and other references there given). It is commonly found simply
with the abbreviation THL.
356 A Grammar of Kakuabeginning (the ‘head’) of the following sentence (c.f., Hopper 1979, Stirling 1993,
Guillaume 2011:110).10
          Kakua uses tail-head linkage as a way to temporally connect sentences or
clauses together, to recapitulate parts of the previous sentence or clause that sets the
(simultaneous) beginning of the following sentence or clause. When using a predicate
as a ‘linker’ (or connector of a chain of clauses or sentences), most of the verbal
morphology can omitted, but it is not obligatorily omitted. The only verbal
morphology that must be omitted with predicates when these are functioning as
linkers are cross-referencing proclitics. Suffixes and enclitics, on the other hand,
seem to be allowed in these connecting predicates. An example of the repetition of
a predicate as a linking strategy is given below (see also example (20) above). The
translation given to the connecting predicates is usually that of ‘while VERBing’, or
‘once VERBed’, or ‘after VERBing’. The connecting predicate is boldfaced:24) dettũp ʔã=t-jâj-ap=wɨt=hĩ         jâj=na                                      ɲâw-ɲàʔ-be

     3SG.M
     ‘he pulled a liana, (after) pulling he ran off’       An interesting characteristic of this repetition of the predicate as a linking
strategy in Kakua is that many examples show the repetition of the object argument
as well. Examples of this are given in (25)-(26) below:25) ʔã=ta-hɨjbi           ʔibi-bâdʔdaʔ                             hɨjbi

    ‘the deceased uncle arrived here, arriving here with company he took our
    deceased mom’
        10
             Some authors, e.g., Seifart (2010b) for Bora, include not only predicates, but also other linking
elements (such as pronouns) in the description of ‘tail-head linkage’ for specific languages.

    ‘there they grinded lots of corn, grinding it at last, after grinding, they ate’        Additionally, in some examples, such as the one presented in (27) below,
there seem to be different tense values for the tail-head linking verbs. Note in the
following example that the ‘repeated’ verb is marked for remote past, while in the
preceding instance it is marked for recent past. Examples such as this also raise
questions regarding the exact way in which this strategy of repetition of predicates
relates to the canonical description of tail-head linking strategies.27) kět ʔĩ=t-ʔɨw-ɨp=ta=be                 ʔɨw-ɨp=hĩ

    house         do-sleep
    ‘they slept, (after) sleeping, (they) made a house and slept’       De Vries (2005:376f), in a typological study of tail-head linkage in Papuan
languages, reports that in some of those languages, instead of repeating the last
predicate of the ‘tail’ clause, the tail-head linkage is formed by using a verb meaning
‘do’ or ‘be’ (translating into ‘having done that/so’ or ‘being so’). This type of linkage
strategy de Vries labels ‘generic verb linkage’.11 Similar to this, Kakua often uses
the verb pêa ‘finish’ as the linking ‘generic’ verb instead of repetition of the same
predicate in the ‘tail’ clause is used. This strategy in Kakua serves as a temporal
linkage of clauses, indicating the temporal sequence of the events. The translation
given in these constructions is ‘after finishing VERB’, referring to the completion of
the event expressed by the predicate of the ‘tail’ clause. See the following example:28) tâʔ-kit                           nin=diʔ         peŵʔ-jòʔbâ=ka
    base.of.blow.gun-CL:log            THIS=OBJ        to.hammer-make.exit.across=ASS    pêa              nin=diʔ              tɨ ̀j-tɨ ̀j=na
    finish        THIS=OBJ         be.good-be.good=DECL
    ‘to this base of the blowgun hammer until it exits across, finishing, do well this
    one’
       11
            Also called ‘summary-head linkage’ in Thompson et al. (2007: 274ff).
358 A Grammar of Kakua         The verb pêa ‘finish’ can also occur together with a repeated predicate of the
‘tail’ clause, reinforcing the temporal sequencing of the linked clauses. The following
example illustrates this:29) bûd-hênaʔ=buh=nit mǐʔ=wãw-jùk     newěɁ Ɂãǰʔ=daʔ
    cut-count=DIR=S.S 3SG.F.POSS=head-hair man 3SG.M.POSS=CL:round    ʔĩ=t-tʃãh-ãp=wɨt=hĩ,                           tʃãh-pêa=nit    kǎnʔ=diʔ
    3PL=EVID-do-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST,                  do-finish=S.S     3SG.F=OBJ    ʔĩ=t-tʃúh-up=wɨt=hĩ
    3PL=EVID-bath-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
    ‘(they) cut her hair like a man’s head they did, finishing doing, they bathed her’        The use of bare verb roots as a tail-head linkage strategy in Kakua serves to
maintain a temporal continuity of the events when there is a sequencing of clauses
in the discourse. As can be seen in the examples in this section, the sequence of
clauses may, but need not, be dependent on one another. As with the description for
switch reference markers presented in the preceding section (§13.3), tail-head
linkage in Kakua is more accurately described as a strategy of linking combined
clauses, rather than merely a subordination strategy, although it may serve to
introduce a subordinate clause.
        The tail-head linkage strategy presented here for Kakua behaves similarly to
those described for other South American, and particularly Amazonian, languages
(e.g., Guillaume 2008 for Cavineña, Zariquiey 2011 for Panoan Kakataibo; Michael
2009 for Zaporoan Iquitos; Overall 2016 for Chicham Aguaruna). It has been noted
before (c.f., Guillaume 2011:112f) that there may be a correlation in some languages
that have tail-head linkage strategies to also have a switch-reference system.
        The fascinating expression of tail-head linkage and switch-reference, and the
further unexplored functions or semantics that these might encode in Kakua, should
be further explored in future analysis and research to expand on the basic description
presented here. For example, it will be interesting to see whether the tail-head linkage
system or the switch reference markers can be analyzed as a type of cosubordination
(as defined by Van Valin & LaPolla 1997) in Kakua.","[376, 377, 378, 379]"
"6.4.2 Comitative and instrumental
        Expressions involving nominals in comitative or instrumental roles are coded
with the clitic =hĩʔ ~ =hiʔ.̃́ The difference between nominals in comitative versus
nominals in instrumental role in Kakua corresponds basically to the distinction of
whether the action is being performed together with a usually animate entity, versus
if the action is being performed using/by means of another entity (usually inanimate).
That is to say, a comitative interpretation of the morpheme clitic =hĩʔ, occurs when
a noun (usually animate) participates in an action together with the subject of the
clause: subject together with comitative performs an action.
        The instrumental interpretation of the noun marked with =hĩʔ occurs when
something is being used by an Agent argument to perform an action: Action
performed with/using instrumental.
        The syntactic structure of clauses involving comitative or instrumental
nominals do not differ one from the other.
     Examples (79)-(80) illustrate cases of noun phrases in the comitative role. Note
that in these examples the object marker =diʔ is not used, showing that its
occurrence on comitative noun phrases is not governed by the same principles as
DOM, according to which they should be marked for being human.

non-prototypical comitative case:81) wɨn-bɨ ̃̂g      pàʔ-at=hiʔ̃́                wɨn      meʔěp=hiʔ̃́      ʔêg=nit

    ‘We also worked clothing (sew clothes) with the (sewing) machine’        It is very likely that using the same morpheme to code nouns in comitative
and instrumental roles, responds to an iconic motivation of the close semantic
relatedness between these two concepts. Example (85) below illustrates an instance
that can be interpreted as both instrumental or comitative. It is extracted from a
conversation, where the speaker is telling about his hunting trip, during which he
found an alligator and chopped off the tail of the animal. In a joking manner he tells
his interlocutor that the tip of the alligator (full of leeches) was tasty to eat together
with manioc bread, or by using the manioc bread to push up the leeches on the
alligator’s tail. Both readings where suggested by the speaker who helped with the

6.4.3 Terminative
        Kakua codes terminative locatives with the preposition pɨ ‘TERM’. This
morpheme is particular in its semantics and its syntax. Semantically, it has a very
narrow meaning, similar to English up until. Terminatives are used to refer to a
specific spatial or temporal location which is situated within a space or time that has
a further continuation. For example, ‘we will walk up until the house’, implying that

preposition, while no other prepositions are attested in Kakua.

                      Elements of the noun phrase
7.0    Introduction
        This chapter describes other words from closed classes that occur in the noun
phrase. In particular this chapter deals with the description of pronouns,
demonstratives, questions words, numerals and quantifiers in Kakua, and further
additional elements of the noun phrase.
        The noun phrase in Kakua is built according to the template in (1) below.
Demonstratives (DEM), lexical possessors (POSS), pronouns (PN) including
possessive and interrogative pronouns, numerals (NUM) and quantifiers (Quant) all
precede the head noun. A head noun may be a bare noun root (see Chapter 4), a
compound of noun roots (see Chapter 5), or another derived noun (e.g., a
nominalized verb stem, or a noun stem taking some derivational morphology). Any
of the elements shown in (1) below with the exception of modifiers can also function
as a noun phrase on its own. Modifiers of the head noun (adjectives or nominalized
verbs) may precede or follow the head noun (see discussion on adjectives in Chapter
3, §3.2.1).","[229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"

10.4.1 Declarative mood =na
        The declarative marker in Kakua expresses an assertion without indicating
the reasons for that assertion or the speaker’s commitment to it (as in the definition
of declaratives given in Palmer 2001:64). It is, in terms of Palmer (2001:64), an
“unqualified assertion”. This characterization of the semantics of the declarative
marker in Kakua also implies that a proposition marked with the declarative mood
can be further specified by modality in order to convey the speaker’s commitment
to it.
        In Kakua the declarative marker can co-occur with some evidential markers,
as long as they encode, by themselves, a certain degree of assertion. Such is the case
of the reported evidential clitic =wɨt ‘REP.EVID’, in which the degree of assertion is
entirely a third party’s responsibility (see examples below).
        The declarative marker in Kakua is the clitic =na ‘DECL’, and although its
most common host is the predicate (verb; as in Table 10.4 above), the declarative
marker can also attach to other parts of speech such as nouns, pronouns,

    ‘so, (like this he) is saying’        As stated in the introduction to this section, the declarative marker is not
restricted to main clauses, as illustrated in the following example. Note that the
declarative marker occurs on the elements of the subordinated clause: 747) [ʔĩ=hǐt-feh-ni=na=diʔ                            ʔĩɁ=mup-ni=na=diʔ

     3PL=drink-SUBR=DECL            everything       3SG.M=HAB-take-finish
     ‘he would always take everything, that which they grinded and left, that which
     they rotted (manioc), that which they drink (beer)’        Assessments can refer to situations in the future or the past. Because of this,
the declarative marker can also co-occur with markers of tense distinctions. This is
illustrated in the following examples:
        6
           Note cases such as the one in (45), where the declarative enclitic occurs twice. Cases like this
are not explained in this grammar and future research is necessary to understand this phenomenon.
         7
            This is a very intriguing syntactic distribution of the declarative marker, occurring in
subordinate clauses even when not necessarily conveying reported speech. Perhaps an explanation for this
strange occurrence in subordinate clauses can be found in other semantic values that the declarative
marker can convey. For example, as implied above, the declarative marker can also convey some kind of
evidentiality value (i.e., that of an ‘unqualified assertion), as opposed to strictly functioning as a
declarative marker. In this sense, the declarative marker in Kakua would have properties of both illocution
and modality markers, blurring the line between these two type of mood markers.

    ‘now she is going to record you’        A few examples above have illustrated the declarative occuring with the
marker of assertion =ka (e.g., (46), (48), and (50)), this serves to illustrate how
clauses with the illocution marker for declarative can be further specified for
modality.
        Likewise, the declarative marker can also occur in sentences marked with the
reported evidential. This is the only evidential category with which the declarative
can co-occur (be it marked by the reportative enclitic =wɨt ‘REP.EVID’, or with the
second-hand evidential prefix t- ~ ti- ‘EVID’, as long as the sentence represents
reported information. Sentences of inferred evidentiality cannot contain the
declarative marker.8 See §10.6 below for a description of the different evidentiality
distinctions). The following examples illustrate the occurrence of the declarative in
reportative sentences:51) kět=diʔ           mi=t-nih=na=wɨt=hĩ,
    3PL=OBJ            3SG.F=EVID-say=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST      dě=beh=tigá                           ɲi=tʃãh

      3SG.F=EVID-say=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST
      ‘She asked them, where are you all going?’
         8
           I believe that one possible explanation for this is that perhaps the inferred evidentiality category
reduces somehow the degree of assertion of a situation. The situation is more likely to be asserted if the
speaker has either full commitment towards the veracity of it, or if the commitment towards the veracity
of the situation falls completely onto someone else. Thus, if the sentence is marked for reported
evidentiality, the responsibility of what is being asserted is not entirely on the speaker’s behalf, but on
somebody else’s. An inferred statement, on the other hand, implies the speaker’s own inferences as regards
the situation and may compromise her reputation if the situation is asserted based on inferred grounds.
This may also serve as another argument suggesting that the declarative marker has some kind of
evidential function.

    ‘their brother in law arrived (it is said)’       The ability of the declarative marker to occur in reportative sentences is
predicted in Hengeveld (2004:1191), referring to quotations as one of the typical
environments in which a declarative marker can occur. 9 More discussion of
declarative clauses is found in Chapter 12.","[303, 304, 305, 306]"
