    Based on Bailey (1975), Foley hypothesises (2005: 136) that Abau distinguishes between
    animate direct objects (which take a suffix -ne) and inanimates (taking a suffix -e). Such
    a distinction does not exist though. The suffix is -e for both animate and inanimate
    objects.
363.1.2 Function of personal pronouns
    Personal pronouns can function as NPs. A personal pronoun in the
nominative form functions as subject. In (1), the bolded nominal pronoun
hiy ‘he’ fills the subject slot.
       (1) Enekwei kamon hokwe              hiy         ley.
              enekwei kamon ho-kwe          hiy         ley
              time       one.CL2 GL.M-TOP 3S.M.SUB go
              ‘One day he left.’
    Personal pronouns can be topicalised. This is achieved by adding the
bound morpheme -kwe to the personal pronoun. In (2), the bolded
pronoun is marked for both subject and topic.
      (2) Enekwei kamon hokwe                hiykwe         sapa
            enekwei kamon ho-kwe             hiy-kwe        sapa
            time      one.CL2 GL.M-TOP 3S.M.SUB-TOP forest
            mon ley.
            mon ley
            LOC go
            ‘One day he went to the forest.’
    The three bolded personal pronouns in (3) function as NPs and all
three are overtly marked for syntactic case. The first two bolded pronouns
are also marked for topic.
       (3) Hiykwe           sapa mon ley. Hiykwe
            hiy-kwe         sapa mon ley hiy-kwe
            3S.M.SUB-TOP forest LOC go 3S.M.SUB-TOP
            hane      me      nonkway kow pa.

            1S-OBJ speak know             BEN NEG.PFTV
            ‘He went to the forest. He did not tell me.’
     In (4), the four bolded pronouns are all marked for syntactic case. The
first three function as independent NPs. The last bolded pronoun is marked
for genitive and part of the underlined NP.
                                                                        37      (4) Hiykwe          hane senkin            me,  ‘Hakwe

          ‘He said to me, “I did not see your wife.”’
3.1.3 Topicalisation of object pronouns
    A NP that consists of a personal pronoun marked for object can be
topicalised in two ways. It can either host the topic marker -kwe (5) or it
can be followed by the general topic marker kokwe (6) and (7).
       (5)Hyekwe           sawk lokrue pa.
          hiy-e-kwe        sawk lokrue pa
          3S.M-OBJ-TOP CHD die             NEG.PFTV
          ‘He did not die.’ Or: ‘As for him, he did not die.’
      (6) Hye        kokwe       sawk peik nak-wak.
          hiy-e      ko-kwe sawk peik nak-lwak
          3S.M-OBJ GL.F-TOP CHD ill           ACC-be
          ‘As for him, he was ill.’
      (7) Sa         hme          kokwe      Kawi hiy
          sa         hom-e        ko-kwe     Kawi hiy
          then/and 2/3PL-OBJ GL.F-TOP Kawi 3S.M.SUB
          me      kow.
          me      kow
          speak BEN
          ‘Kawi told them.’ Or: ‘It was Kawi who told them.’
    When a personal pronoun (and also a NP, see §3.7.4 and §3.9.8) is
already syntactically or semantically marked it is always topicalised by
the feminine topic marker kokwe regardless of number or gender. In (6),
kokwe follows a masculine pronoun marked for object and in (7) a plural
pronoun marked for object. For examples of the feminine topic marker
kokwe following a postpositional semantic marker, see examples (152)
and (153). The objective personal pronoun marked by -kwe appears to
vary freely with the one marked by kokwe. There seems to be no semantic
difference between hyekwe ‘as for him’ (5) and hye kokwe ‘as for him’
38(6). Both forms are fully accepted; the shorter form might be simply an
abbreviation of the longer version.
3.1.4 Pronoun modification
   The personal pronoun can be modified by the suffixes listed in
Table 16.
               TABLE 16: PERSONAL PRONOUN MODIFICATIONFunction     Suffix   Occurrence           Examples        Gloss

                      -kwaw-aw             ha-kwaw-aw      ‘I by myself!’
                      -kiaw-aw             ha-kiaw-aw      ‘it is I!’
                      -ayay-aw             homkwe          ‘they among
                                           hom-kiaw-       themselves’
                                           ayay-aw
   The restrictive suffix -kwaw is not derived from -kwe suffixed by -aw.
Also the selective suffix -kiaw is not related to the topic marker -kwe.
                                                                            39Topic markers are used to mark constituents for background, while
restrictive and selective markers mark constituents as foreground
information. (For the distinction between background and foreground:
§8.1, §8.2 and Table 45.)
    Secondly, NPs can never be topic-marked twice within the same noun
phrase. The NP poup hiykiaw hokwe in (8) is topicalised by the general
topic marker hokwe. Hiykiaw ‘3S.M-SLCT’ can therefore not host a topic
marker itself.
       (8) Poup hiykiaw                hokwe       hyo
             poup hiy-kiaw             ho-kwe      hiy-o

            ‘The spirit himself (= he took it upon himself) went off in
            order to get all his relatives.’
    The NP aio hiykwaw hokwe in (9) is also topicalised by hokwe. We
can therefore conclude that the kw- in -kwaw is not related to the topic
marker -kwe. Hiykwaw ‘3S.M-RSTR’ cannot host a topic marker since it is
part of a NP that is topic marked by hokwe.
        (9) Aio        hiykwaw         hokwe     yeyk se
             aio       hiy-kwaw        ho-kwe    yeyk s-e

             DYN work
             ‘Father can make a canoe by himself (i.e. he can do it alone).’
    The difference between the restrictive and the selective marker
becomes evident when comparing (9) and (10). Both markers single out a
referent from a potentially much larger group. The restrictive marker does
so by drawing attention to the fact that the referent is alone and not joined
by other available candidates. The selective marker singles out one
referent by drawing attention to the fact that this referent, rather than other
possible referents, was selected.
40     (10) Aio     hiykiaw           hokwe      yeyk se
          aio     hiy-kiaw          ho-kwe     yeyk s-e

          DYN work
          ‘Father himself can make a canoe (i.e. of all candidates who
          could, he can certainly do it).’
    It should be noted that the bolded pronouns in examples (8), (9) and
(10) do not function as the head of the NP. They modify the head of the NP
as a NP marker. These types of constructions are dealt with in later
sections (§3.6 - §3.8). However, given the proper context, these personal
pronouns could occur by themselves with or without the NP final topic
marking. Within a context where the referent is understood example (8)
can be adapted to (11).
      (11) Hiykiaw              hyo        wayhih-nayh          me
             hiy-kiaw           hiy-o      wayh-ih-nayh         m-e

             ‘He himself (= he took it upon himself) went off in order to
             get all his relatives.’
    The restrictive marker -kwaw can only be suffixed to a subject
pronoun. It contrasts uniqueness of the marked entity in contrast to other
possible entities. The restrictive marker -aw when suffixed directly to an
object pronoun has the same function. This is demonstrated in (12) and
(13).

          men).’
     The selective suffix -kiaw, and the restrictive suffixes -kwaw and the
restrictive marker -aw can be made more emphatic by adding the
emphatic suffix -aw.
    In (14), the selective suffix -kiaw is combined with the emphatic
suffix -aw.

            ‘That work is very difficult. Only he himself can do it.’
    In (15), the restrictive suffix -aw is suffixed by the emphatic marker
-aw.

             3S.M.SUB-TOP 3S.F-OBJ-RSTR-EMPH think
             ‘He thought of her and her alone.’
    The reciprocal concept of ‘among themelves’ is expressed by
    a. repeating the personal pronoun,
    b. suffixing the selective marker -kiaw to the last personal pronoun,
    c. adding the reciprocal marker -ayay as a final suffix.
42      (16) Homkwe            homkiaw-ayay senkin     pese

    A personal pronoun can be modified simultaneously by three markers,
which occur in a set order: selective marker -kiaw, reciprocal marker
-ayay and finally the emphatic marker -aw. This ordering can be seen in
(17):
      (17) Uwr homkwe            sawk hom-kiaw-ayay-aw         kasaw

            ‘The men were angry with each other.’3.2     Nouns
    The following sections discuss nouns. Nouns are treated early in this
chapter, in spite of the fact that many of the NP markers which carry
information on the gender and number of a noun have not been discussed.
This order has nevertheless been chosen, since a treatment of the NP final
markers, numerals and adjectives cannot be done without a proper
understanding of the noun word.
3.2.1 Simple nouns
     Nouns in Abau do not carry any distinctive marks for number and
gender nor do they carry any information on noun classes or semantic or
syntactic function. This type of information is carried by noun phrase final
markers, including numerals. In (18), the three underlined nouns are not
affixed for number, gender or function. The bolded somokwe topicalises
the noun uwr ‘man’ and marks it for plural. The postposition sok ‘EXCT’
marks the noun ki ‘ground’ for location, the personal pronoun homkwe
‘3PL.SUB-TOP’ refers to the noun uwr ‘man’ and gives it agent function.
Finally the feature human of the noun sa ‘woman’ is carried by the
                                                                        43numeral prueyn. Number, gender and object role are carried by the
feminine object marker ke.
     (18) Uwr somokwe                 sawk ki        ompok sok
           Uwr so-mo-kwe              sawk ki        ompok sok

           “When those people were in the middle of the road (= half
           way on their journey), they met a young woman.’
    Affixation on nouns is very limited. Kinship terms used as terms of
address have no affixation, but kinship terms used as terms of reference
are suffixed (see Table 12).
       (19) kam        ‘maternal uncle     kam-uh    ‘maternal uncle
                       (term of address)’            (term of reference)’

                       (term of address)’            (term of reference)’
     When the semantics of the nouns allows, nouns can be affixed by the
restrictive maker -aw and the intensifier -ar.
       (20) Uwrsa           homkwe           nays-aw       peyk huon.

             ‘He is not a real man.’
     These markers -aw and -ar are never affixed to verbs, but can be
affixed to adjectives. For the difference between nouns and adjectives, see
§3.5.
443.2.2 Compound nouns
    There are many compound nouns in Abau. They are simply formed by
noun roots placed in juxtaposition. They can be distinguished from single-
morpheme nouns with the same number of syllables by their intonation
patterns. For example ompiy ‘skirt (grass)’ is a regular two syllable word,
but om-pi ‘village-ridge’ is a two syllable compound noun. The pitch
contrast between the two syllables within the first word is relatively small,
but very distinct in the compound noun. The second noun of a compound
noun sequence always carries a very distinct low pitch. This is further
exemplified by (22), where the pitch on the second noun yok ‘shoot’ is the
lowest within the utterance. This low pitch is marked with number 3 to
contrast with the last syllable of other two-syllable words that do not have
such a low pitch.
      (22) 1      2      1     3          1       1 2 1

            3S.M-TOP banana-shoot PL-OBJ plant NEG.PFTV
            ‘He did not plant the banana shoots.’
3.2.3 Endocentric noun compounds
     There are four types of semantic relationship encoded by endocentric
noun compounds in Abau. (The noun compound is called an endocentric
construction as both constituents are nouns and therefore belong to the
same word class.) Endocentric compounds encode four types of semantic
relationship, which are listed below.
1) Whole-part. The first noun modifies the second noun in a whole-part
relationship.
   In (23) the compound noun omku-saw ‘banyan tree hole’ represents a
whole-part relationship.
     (23) Homkwe hreme omkuw-saw                      mon hiy-wayr.

   Other examples where the first noun modifies the second noun in a
whole-part relationship:
                                                                           45

2) Specifier. The first noun modifies the second noun for category, e.g.
yeyk-yier ‘place to moor canoes’.
   In (25), the initial noun of the compound noun yeyk-yier ‘place to
moor canoes’ specifies the category of the subsequent noun.
     (25) Sawk omok yeyk-yier             mon hiy-ey.

    Other examples where the first noun modifies the second noun for
category:

            hoyow-wayh      (lit. fun-friend)    ‘friend one jests with’
3) Size. The second noun modifes the first noun for size, e.g. a-ney ‘small
house’.
    Other examples:
      (27) sa-ney           (lit. woman-child) ‘girl’
            huok-waw        (lit. pig-round)     ‘round sturdy pig’
4) Generic category. Both nouns function equally in the compound to
express a generic category of entities e.g. uwr-sa ‘people’ (lit. man-
woman) and ney-sa ‘family’ (lit. child-woman).
    Other examples where two equal nouns combine to indicate a generic
category:
      (28) yeik-ompow spear-arrow           ‘weapons’
            sune-iha        leg-hand             ‘body, or: body parts’
     In (29), two semantically different compound nouns are listed with
identical constituents in different order. Ney-sa is literally
‘child (or: small)-woman’     and     sa-ney  is   literally   ‘woman-
child (or: small)’. The meaning of each compound noun is determined by
its compound noun type.
46
      (29) ney-sa ‘family’ Compound noun type 4 -
                           equal nouns indicate generic category.
           sa-ney ‘girl’   Compound noun type 3 -
                           second noun modifies first for size.
    One could also argue that sa-ney ‘girl’ is type 2 and that the noun ney
‘child’ is modified for category.
3.2.4 Exocentric noun compounds
   At least two types of exocentric compound nouns have been observed
where the constituents making up the compound noun belong to different
word classes.
    1. A juxtaposed verb and noun forming a compound noun, whereby
the verb modifies the noun for category. (30)
   2. A juxtaposed modifier and noun forming a compound noun,
whereby the modifier modifies the noun category. (31)
     (30) Sawk lous-uwr homkwaw                hin.

     Abau has both gender (masculine/feminine) and a cross-cutting
system of numeral classifiers, as do the related languages Iwam,
Wogamusin and Chenapian (Laycock and Z’graggen 1975). This feature
is also characteristic of some Indic, Dravidian, Iranian and Arawak (South
America) languages (Aikhenvald 2000: 185). As stated before, number
and gender are not marked on the noun word itself but are indicated by
pronouns, demonstratives, numerals and other grammatical markers that
follow the noun. The relationship between gender and number classifiers
is discussed §3.4.6.
                                                                            47    The gender of concrete nouns is determined largely by the form of the
object, especially its shape and size. A noun that refers to an entity that
can have various sizes can therefore occur either with masculine or
feminine gender. The gender categories distinguished by Abau are given
in Table 17.

                 - long and extended        - round with little height
Abstract                                    - always assigned feminine
entities                                    gender
    In §3.3.1, the details of the default principles of gender assignment are
discussed. In §3.3.2 the apparent freedom in the selection of gender for
temporal expressions is commented on.
3.3.1 Specifics of gender assignment
a. Human beings and spirits are differentiated on the basis of
their inherent sex
    Nouns referring to human beings (including kinship terms) and spirits
are assigned gender on the basis of their inherent sex. Gender is not
assigned to animals on the basis of inherent sex, except for domestic
animals like pigs and dogs. The gender choice for nouns referring to other
animals is determined by the form and size of the animal.
48b. Abstract and non-material nouns are nearly always
feminine
    Non-material and abstract nouns like ok ‘talk’, aw ‘fight’, weyn
‘behaviour’, yayh ‘song’, mey ‘work’, oksa ‘sound’, hay ‘magic’,
nonkway ‘knowledge’ are all feminine. One exception observed is the
word prawk ‘smell, scent’ which is masculine. It is possible that smell is
considered material rather than non-material.
c. Objects regarded as two-dimensional are feminine
     No object is of course truly two-dimensional, but thin objects like
leaves, tablets and coins are feminine. Insects, possibly on the basis that
they are regarded as two-dimensional, are also feminine nouns. The
contrast between two-dimensionality (feminine) and three-dimensionality
(masculine) is essential in gender determination. Two other features,
however, play a role in determining the gender of objects for which it is
hard to determine whether they should be classified as two-dimensional or
as three-dimensional. Objects with regular three-dimensional features tend
to be masculine, except if they have a very flat surface (see c1) or if the
roundness of the object (not in a 3- but only in a 2-dimensional way) is a
very salient feature (see c2).
c1. Objects with a flat surface which are not too voluminous
are feminine
    An object that has a flat surface and not too voluminous is regarded as
feminine. In the Abau world view, all fish are regarded as having a flat
surface and are therefore feminine. The feature of a flat surface is also
dominant in nouns like howk ‘lake’ and iwa ‘swamp’, but not in yawp
‘river’. The latter is masculine, because here the feature of extendedness is
predominant. Body parts that have a flat surface and which are not too
voluminous are regarded feminine, e.g. iha ‘hand’, sune ‘foot’, nweyk
‘ear’. Most other body parts are considered three-dimensional and are
assigned masculine gender. This includes makwey ‘head’, kasaw ‘nose’,
nene ‘eye’, and uron ‘heart’.
c2. Objects which are round from a two-dimensional
perspective are feminine
    When objects have two dimensional roundness as the predominant
feature, they are classed as feminine. The generic word for ‘snake’ sok is
                                                                         49masculine. Apparently, its extendedness is in focus. However, a particular
green garden snake wondeis is referenced with feminine pronominal
markers. This snake is often coiled up in the form of a circle and this
feature might be in focus here. Also included in this set of two-
dimensional roundness are the nouns hne ‘bird’s nest’ and kan ‘a vine
woven into a circle’. However, the loan word bal ‘ball’ is masculine,
because the roundness is here three-dimensional.
d. Objects regarded as three-dimensional are masculine
    When the feature three-dimensionality is regarded as predominant the
noun is marked masculine. This depends on the perception of the speaker,
which may vary as is illustrated in examples (32) and (33). Truly three-
dimensional entities are certain fruits: su ‘coconut’ am ‘breadfruit’. As
long as the three-dimensional feature is predominant the entity can be
small, e.g. nene ‘eye’. This set also includes all liquids, e.g. hu ‘water’,
nioh ‘blood’, sueyr ‘rain’.
    The distinction between two-dimensional or three-dimensional
depends on the perception of the speaker. The choice is sometimes
arbitrary, e.g. the word mein ‘stone’ occurs in a wide variety of forms and
sizes. When features like flatness and roundness are in focus the noun
mein is regarded as feminine. When, however, the features of three-
dimensionality or large size are in focus the noun mein is regarded as
masculine.
    The word a ‘house’ is masculine, in spite of the fact that the object
has a number of flat surfaces. The predominant features which are in
focus are its large size and its three-dimensionality.
e. Animal categories are distinguished according to size
    Larger animals tend to be masculine, smaller animals tend to be
feminine. Large animals, like mu ‘crocodile’, pareis ‘wallaby’, nwoh
‘dog’ are masculine. Animals that have as the salient feature
extendedness, like sok ‘snake’ , mnow ‘eel’ and kie ‘lizard’, are all
masculine.
    Larger birds, like worim ‘flying fox’, wayp ‘eagle’, and mowr
‘hornbill’ are masculine, but a moderate-sized bird like sokua ‘cockatoo’
is regarded as feminine and so are all birds that are smaller than the
cockatoo.
50    The noun pruam ‘cassowary’ is regarded as feminine. 2 This
constitutes an exception to the size feature. The feminine gender choice
could be the result of the Abau world view. In a well-known creation story
a cassowary gives birth to a human being.
f.     Long or extended objects are masculine
    Long objects like now ‘tree’, now-pay ‘log’, and iroum ‘stick’ are
masculine on the basis of the feature of extendedness. But nouns like now-
ku ‘tree stump’, youk ‘paddle’, ku ‘axe’, and seik ‘knife’ are feminine,
most likely because of salient other features like roundness and
smoothness of flat surface area.
    The word youk ‘paddle’ is a good example of the speaker’s perception
in ascertaining the correct gender. A Sepik paddle is very long and also
has a large flat blade. The speaker can focus on the feature of smooth
surface, or on the feature of extendedness. The outcome changes the
assignment of gender. In (32), the speaker refers to a tree as paddle, since
he plans to make a paddle out of this tree. The focus is here on the feature
extendedness of the tree and the noun is marked masculine. In (33), the
speaker refers to a finished paddle which always has a large flat and
smooth canoe blade. The predominant feature has to do with a flat and
smooth surface. The noun is therefore marked feminine.
      (32) Hakwe            youk     se         seyr.
             Ha-kwe         youk     se         seyr
             1S.SUB-TOP paddle 3S.M-OBJ cut
             ‘I cut the “paddle” tree.’
      (33) Hakwe          youk     ke        lira.
             Ha-kwe       youk     ke        lira
             1SUB-TOP paddle 3S.F-OBJ see
             ‘I see the paddle.’
     Gender is assigned to loan words based on appearance features. In
(34), the loan word pen ‘pen’ is masculine, because of the salient feature
of extendedness. The loan word redio is feminine based on the fact that
this object has flat and smooth surfaces.","[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]"

                  1. Introduction1.1 Location and population
     Abau is a language spoken by more than 7000 people in Sandaun
(formerly West Sepik) Province, Papua New Guinea (see map 1). The
language area consists of the villages to the immediate east and west of
the Green River Station, as well as the villages along the Sepik River and
its tributaries, starting at the border with Indonesian Papua (the Indonesian
province of Papua, formerly Irian Jaya) all the way down to the border
with the East Sepik. The area depends mainly on air transport for supplies,
since there are no roads to connect the Green River Area with the coast
and transport via the Sepik River has proven to be troublesome.

1.2 Language name
    The language name Abau means infertile land. It is any area of open
grassy land without trees that cannot be used for food gardens. The more
than 1 kilometre long Green River Airstrip was built on such land. The
local people continued to refer to the area as Abau, and consequently the
Green River Station Area with its airstrip became known as Abau. The
name eventually transferred to the people group and the language. (The
word Abau is also used adverbially to indicate barrenness in a woman.
When following the word makwey ‘head’ it means bald.)1.3 Affiliation and earlier studies
    In Wurm’s classification system (Laycock 1973; Laycock and
Z’graggen 1975; Wurm 1982), Abau is classified as an isolate at the
lowest level within the Upper Sepik Stock, Upper Sepik Super-stock,
Sepik sub-phylum, Sepik-Ramu phylum.
    More recent research by Foley (2005) and Ross (2005) regards Abau
as a member of the Sepik family, related to other languages of the upper
and middle Sepik river valley, and the Sepik hill country, but not to the
languages of the Lower Sepik or Ramu families.
     There have been several previous attempts at describing the Abau
language, but little published research. Wordlists were collected by patrol
officers F.R. Cawley (1919) and N.J. Cavanagh (1961); Cawley published
his wordlists in several Papua Annual Reports between 1917 and the
1930s. Kay Liddle, who was the missionary at Green River in 1960-62 for
Christian Missions in Many Lands (CMML), filled seven notebooks with
texts, typical constructions, a phonemic statement and the beginnings of a
dictionary. However this material has never been published. 1
     Three linguistic surveys of the language have been published. Loving
and Bass (1964) conducted a survey on behalf of the Australian
administration; they refer to the language as “Green River”, and note that
if administrative officers at Green River station learned the language, they
would be able to communicate with 3/5 of their administrative area. The
second was conducted by Donald Laycock of Australian National
University, who published a brief wordlist (Laycock 1965a) and1
    Information compiled from Loving and Bass (1964); Laycock (1973); Carrington (1996).
                                                                         3description of the phonology (Laycock 1965b). A sociolinguistic survey
was also conducted by Martin (1981).
    The only other primary publications have been a two-page grammar
sketch by Laycock and Z’graggen (1975: 744-746), and materials by
Bailey (1975) – focusing mainly on phonology and discourse. His
phonology write-up, especially in the areas of the vowels, differs greatly
from the findings by Lock (2007).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"

occurs twice within the sentence. It seems that the first occurrence of the
personal pronoun focuses on the topic function of the referred-to
participant, while the second occurrence of the same personal pronoun
focuses on the subject function of the referred-to participant.
     In (16), the noun phrase hunkwe occurs twice. The first hunkwe occurs
before the topicalised noun phrase marked by mokwe. Although its
marking already sets the NP apart for agent function, it still seems that the
topic status rather than the agent function of the personal pronoun is in
focus. It is therefore marked as a P2 constituent. The second hunkwe is the
last topicalised constituent before the comment part of the sentence and is
therefore analysed as a P1 constituent. Its subject function is central here.

topic-marked, and is therefore a separate sentential constituent in the P2

    The comment component of the sentence is marked by the obligatory
absence of the topic marker -kwe. The comment part is preceded by the
topic part of the sentence. The break between the topic component and the
comment component of the sentence is in nearly all cases marked by the
last constituent of the topic slot that hosts the constituent-final topic
marker -kwe.
     Nearly all sentences occur with a topic and a comment part, but only
the latter is obligatory, as can be seen in (19). The example is taken from a
story in which a group of people cut trees in the forest until disaster hits.
Neither object NP nor the subject NP are topicalised; both belong to the
comment part of the sentence. It is very unusual to have a non-topicalised
NP object in a clause with OSV order. It is generally regarded as incorrect
grammar (see §6.5.1) but might be permitted here because it forms the
                                                                        309climax of the story. The speaker treats both noun phrases as new
information, and no topic markers are used.

The different constituents making up the comment part are labelled
separately. The various constituents making up the topic part are labelled
as well.
310   In (20), the topic slot is filled with two constituents, hakwe ‘1S.TOP’
and huok mokwe ‘pigs.GL.PL.TOP’. The comment slot is filled by the
modifier phrase kamon-aw ‘one-RSTR’.
     (20) P2         P1                   Comment:Numeral

            1S-TOP pig       GL.PL-TOP one.CL2-RSTR
            ‘As for me, regarding pigs, (I) have only one.’
    One can delete the topic marker mokwe. As a result the topic part of
the sentence is only filled by one constituent, hakwe ‘I’, and the comment
part is filled by the NP comment huok kamon-aw ‘pig one-RSTR’.
      (21) P1           Comment:NP
              Hakwe huok             kamon-aw.

              ‘As for me, I have only one pig.’
     In (22), the comment part only contains the verb phrase. It is
relatively rare to only have the verb phrase fill the comment component of
the predication.

   The comment part of a sentence can be just the verb phrase, often
modified by a modal marker. In (26), the comment part consists of the
dynamic modal marker liy and the verb phrase it modifies.

            ‘The lizard came from the depths of the lake to the surface.’8.5     Tail position
    A NP marked for object and topic-marked by -kwe can also be placed
in tail position or P3 position, intonationally cut off from the preceding
predicate and separated by a pause. Tails are also referred to as
afterthoughts or right-dislocated elements. According to Dik (1981:152-
54) the P3 slot is not meant for new information or information totally
                                                                        313independent of the predication, but rather information that supplements or
modifies the predication.
    Givón (1987:182) suggests that P3 constituents only take the previous
clause in their scope, perhaps elaborating on what has already been said in
the clause. This is true in Abau, where the tail is always interpreted
anaphorically, i.e. it contains old information. The speaker is unlikely to
place a new referent in tail position to which the listener had no access
through previous reference or simple deduction.
    The verb phrase is typically the last constituent of a sentence or
clause, unless a nominal constituent is placed in tail position. The final
intonation over the verb phrase is not affected by the P3 constituent
following. A short pause sets the two clearly apart. The P3 position is
normally filled by a noun phrase, ex. (30) and (31) or NPs with an
embedded modifying clause (ex. §8.5.1).
    Right-dislocated noun phrases are marked in one of the following
three ways:
    a. only marked pragmatically (30).
    b. marked pragmatically and also for syntactic or semantic case (31).
    c. marked grammatically and not pragmatically (32).
     In (30), the speaker wants to ascertain that the listeners know what
participant has agent role, so the NP huok sohokwe ‘this pig’ is placed in
tail position, separated from the rest of the sentence by a pause. The NP
has agent role within the sentence but is only marked with the
demonstrative topic marker.

             ‘And (the pig) grabbed and bit him, causing him to fall, that

   Example (31) is taken from a story about two birds. The listener
expects both participants to play a role within the story line. The activity
314of one of the two birds is mentioned. The speaker decides to refer to the
other participant as well and utilises the tail position. The NP in P3
position is topicalised and marked with a post-positional marker
indicating accompaniment.

    In (32), the NP in tail position does not host a topic marker, it is only
syntactically marked with the object marker me.

    NPs are placed in tail positions for pragmatic reasons. One can always
delete a NP in tail position with no damage to the grammatical correctness
of the sentence. However, the deletion might affect the clarity of the
communication. Some reasons for including a tail constituent:
    1. To correct potential lack of information. The speaker fears that
        the communication was incomplete or unclear and wants to
        ensure that the listener can keep track of the identity and/or roles
        of the various referents (30);
    2. Avoid diverting information. An attempt is made to keep related
        information together, and so additional, potentially interfering,
        information is placed in tail position (34).
                                                                          315     In (30) above, the tail position is used for a participant that has been
introduced already and can be deduced from the context. The speaker
nevertheless adds the participant in the tail of the predication to rule out
any confusion.
    Example (33) illustrates a similar point. One can delete the tail
without causing the sentence to be grammatically incorrect. The semantic
domain of the verb lwawk ‘step into’ anticipates an object that has sides.
This verb is frequently used with the noun yeyk ‘canoe’. In spite of the
fact that the listener can be expected to supply the location yeyk ‘canoe’,
the speaker still adds the information to rule out confusion.

            ‘The real (= human) lad did not step in, but the spirit did - in
            regard to that canoe.’
    In (34), a temporal NP occurs in the tail position. It is different from
example (33), where the information in the tail completes the thought
expressed in the main clause. In (34), the tail contains additional
information. Its absence would not lead to miscommunication, since the
main information preceding the P3 constituent is complete in itself. By
placing the additional information in the tail, the speaker keeps the central
information in the main clause concise and together.
      (34) P2         P1             Comment

            ‘I will bring you to school, today.’
    It is relatively rare for the tail position not to be topicalised. The
pragmatic topic marker consigns background status to the topicalised
316constituent. If the tail occurs without a topic marker, the status of the
constituent changes and it starts to have the capacity to mark new
information. Compare the following two examples:
    Example (35) is part of a dialogue between two sisters. The tail could
have been deleted, as the listener only needed to keep track of two
participants.
      (35) Pway-ih             hokwe    sawk ok piap ok

            ‘(Consequently) the older sister spoke bad words, to her

    In (36), the NP in tail position is not topic-marked and should
therefore not be treated as background information. Without the
information expressed in the tail, the listener could not have deduced with
certainty the identity of the recipient that kow ‘benefactive’ anticipated.

8.5.1 Clauses in tail position
   Although rare, a subordinate clause can be placed in tail position.
These clauses contain given information or information that can be easily
                                                                      317accessed by deduction. These clauses can be deleted without affecting the
grammatical correctness or intonation of the main clause.
     The following two examples have been taken from the story “The two
brothers” (§11.1.1). In (37), a subordinate clause with ankin is placed in
tail position. As the context of the story is the shooting of over-flying
birds, the contents of the clause in P3 position can be deduced by the
listener.
      (37) Ara         pokon yaprue non-aw          hin    e,
             ara       pokon yaprue non-aw          hin    e

            ‘Man, you should only shoot your very best, when a bird flies
            near.’
    A noun phrase that contains a relative clause can also occur in tail
position. In (38), the relative clause (bolded) modifies the head of the
noun phrase now ‘tree’.
      (38) Hom wueir se                 lousne menkin,
            hom wueir s-e               lousne menkin

            ‘When they arrived in the garden, the younger brother
            consequently showed the older brother - the large tree
            standing in the middle of the garden.’
318    Examples (37) and (39) are taken from the same story about two bird
hunters. In (39), the NP in tail position ahney senkin senkin ‘all kinds of
birds’ is modified by the bolded relative clause. The P3 constituent (as all
P3 constituents) can be deleted without loss of grammatical correctness.
The object noun phrase in the P3 slot is not present in the main clause.
However, the referent ahney ‘birds’ is signalled in the main clause by
huon ‘OBJ moves to SUB’. The listener can deduce the arrival of the birds
from the context, but the added tail constituent completes the information
and rules out ambiguity.
      (39) Hoh non-ie          yawriy iwak liok         menkin, sa

            their shelter), they saw (them) from far away, all kinds of
            birds flying and coming towards them.’
8.5.2 Tail constituents in clauses with transitive verbs
     Instead of occurring as clauses embedded in the main clause, cause
and reason clauses are often extraposed from the main clause to P3, the
tail position in the sentence.
    These cause and reason constructions are primarily encoded by
clauses that look like headless relative clauses (see §6.6.3). The tail
constituents are terminated by a demonstrative marked for either subject
or object. A subject demonstrative in final P3 position indicates cause, an
object demonstrative indicates reason. Both reason and cause P3
constructions are preceded by an adverbial causal demonstrative in the
main clause.
    These reason and cause clauses in the tail position have the following
features:
                                                                         319    a. The normal relative clause features: no internal topic marking on
       any of the constituents; the use of the relativiser ma preceding the
       verb phrase.
    b. Tail final marking consists of a demonstrative marker that is
       either marked for subject (cause) or object (reason).
    c. The tail construction makes the goal or cause explicit that the
       adverbial causal demonstrative (§4.4.3) in the main clause already
       referred to.
    In (40), the P3-final demonstrative marker sokwe signals object and
therefore the tail functions as a reason clause. The main clause contains the
adverbial causal demonstrative sokwe which expresses a causal relationship
between this main clause and what went before in the previous sentence, or
wider previous context. By adding the optional P3 constituent, the speaker
makes the reason for the laughter explicit.
      (40) Man          hokwe        sawk mowkwar ke

            ‘So the crayfish laughed at the turtle, because she had rolled
            into the water.’
     The only difference between (40) and (41) is the final marking on the
P3 constituent. In (41), the clause-final demonstrative sohok signals
subject, and therefore the tail functions as a causal clause. The difference
is reflected in the alternative translation of these two examples. Like in
(40), the tail position is only added to avoid ambiguity, not to give totally
new information.

            ‘So the crayfish laughed at the turtle, because she rolled into

    An alternative free translation can be given for (41) that expresses the
agent role of the tail constituent: ‘The fact that (the turtle) rolled into the
water caused the crayfish to laugh at the turtle.’
    In (42), the sentence-final sohiy marks the tail as subject. The tail
therefore has agent function and expresses cause. The tail makes the
causal relationship explicit that the adverbial causal demonstrative marker
sehe in the main clause already referred to. The tail-final masculine
subject marking sohiy ‘DDEM-3S.M.SUB’ agrees in gender and number
with the masculine subject of the tail hiy ‘3S.M.SUB’. The tail contains a
bolded complement clause marked by the object marker e (for similar
constructions see e.g. §6.6.4 and §9.4.1).

    An alternative free translation can be given for (42) that expresses the
agent function of the tail constituent: ‘(The fact) that he wanted to marry
another woman made her really angry with her husband.’
     In (43), the clause-final sohok marks the tail as subject. The tail has
therefore agent function and expresses cause. The tail makes the causal
relationship explicit that was referred to by the adverbial causal
demonstrative seme in the main clause. The tail final feminine subject
marker sohok agrees in gender and number with the feminine subject of
the tail hmo prueyn hok ‘one (F) of them’.

8.5.3 Tail constituents in intransitive clauses
     It was demonstrated in §6.7 that an Object NP in a clause that has a VP
filled by a motion verb functions as purpose constituent. Similarly, a
322constituent that is marked for object indicates purpose, if the main clause
has a verb phrase filled by a motion verb. In (44), the constituent in tail
position is a NP with an embedded clause (bolded) that modifies the
masculine head om-huok. The NP final sehe agrees with the head of the NP
in gender and number.
      (44) Uwr homkwe          yerki kamon mon ley. Sa

            ‘The men went one way. The women went the other way for
            the purpose of (the activity of) looking for the village pig.’
8.5.4 Contents or manner clauses in tail position
    Apart from reason, cause and purpose, contents or manner can also be
expressed by a subordinate clause with the assistance of the manner
adverb senkin.
    A main clause with the manner adverb senkin expresses the concept of
manner or contents. Additional information about the manner or contents
can be given by an optional constituent in tail position. The tail position
can be formed in three possible ways:
    a. a relative clause with a deleted head, followed by a final senkin;
    b. a relative clause with a deleted head, followed by a final senkin
        plus the same verb repeated that occurred in the main clause;
    c. a relative clause with a deleted head.
   The most common form is to simply mark the clause with senkin,
which corresponds with the adverbial senkin in the main clause, as is
demonstrated in (45).

    Below, two more options are given for the formation of the tail
constituent. The first alternative is the adverbial senkin in tail position
followed by the verb of the main clause, in this case: senkin lon. Or lastly,
the tail constituent can occur without the adverbial senkin or any
additional verb. Both clauses have the same translation.

   In (46), the tail constituent expresses manner and is marked by senkin
which corresponds with senkin in the main clause.

sentence constituents
    Predications, nearly without exception, contain a topic and a comment
component. The speaker makes choices in what he marks as topic or
comment. The outcome of these choices determines the prominence of the
various sentence constituents. There are various ways to raise or lower the
prominence of the constituents.
    The most common order within Abau is SOV, but this order can
easily be changed to OSV. The syntactic role of NPs is not determined by
their place within the sentence but by their NP marking. As stated before,
nearly all NPs are marked syntactically and/or pragmatically. A large
percentage of NPs is marked for either subject or object, and the speaker
might make use of SOV or OSV order depending on the prominence he
wants to assign to the NPs (see §8.6.1). NPs which are not marked for
subject or object are very often topicalised by general topic markers
(§3.6). In spite of this lack of syntactic marking, these NPs can still have
patient or agent function, which is mostly determined by the context.
Their marking, or lack of marking, also determines how NPs are given
more or less prominence (see §8.6.2).
8.6.1 Changing prominence of subject
     Normal order within Abau is SOV, but based on prominence choices
a speaker can change this order. In (47), the order is changed to OSV. The
object NP Keno se kokwe is obligatorily topicalised, because it has been
left-located and is therefore placed in the topic part of the sentence (see
                                                                         325§8.3). The topicalised object precedes the non-topicalised subject ur hiy
‘vine 3S.SUB’, and as a result the subject is part of the comment part of the
sentence (see §8.4). The subject NP becomes the most prominent NP at the
expense of the object NP, which would have been the most prominent
constituent in an SOV clause.
      (47) Keno se               kokwe,      ur    hiy
             Keno s-e            ko-kwe ur         hiy
             Keno 3S.M-OBJ GL.F-TOP vine 3S.M.SUB
             way-a-way          kuayk nayr.
             lway-a-lway        kuayk nayr
             wrap-DUP-wrap fall         night
             ‘In regard to Keno, (it was) a vine (that) wrapped around him
             causing him to fall.’
     In the example above the subject was given more prominence. It is
also possible to suppress the subject. A subject has to be expressed when
the object is not topicalised, but one can omit the subject if the object NP
is topicalised by -kwe. In examples (48) and (49) respectively, hmekwe
‘3PL.OBJ.TOP’ and hye kokwe ‘3S.M.OBJ.TOP’ are understood to undergo
the events encoded in the respective VPs. This construction is widely used
when there is no need or no desire to express the agent of the predication.
       (48) Hmekwe             iha nonaw         liy nekie way.
             hom-e-kwe         iha   non-aw      liy nekie lway
             2/3PL-OBJ-TOP hand CMT-RSTR DYN hold carry
             ‘They can be picked up by hand.’
    In (49), no subject is expressed.
      (49) Hye           kokwe      yeyn iha sirom  senkin
             hiy-e       ko-kwe yeyn iha      sirom so-enkin

             CAUS-do tell-DUP-tell stay
             ‘He was taught for five months.’
    A subject can be inserted in the examples above without changing the
form or order of the other constituents, e.g. example (48) is rewritten with
an inserted subject hromkwe ‘we’ in (50).
326      (50) Hmekwe          hromkwe       iha nonaw  liy
           hom-e-kwe       hrom-kwe      iha non-aw liy

           nekie lway
           hold carry
           ‘We can pick them up by hand.’
    When the object NP is no longer topicalised, a subject needs to be
expressed in order to create a grammatically correct sentence. In (51), a
subject (filled by hakwe ‘1S.SUB’) is required since the NP object hye
‘3S.M’ is not topic-marked.
     (51) Hakwe            hye        yeyn iha sirom        senkin

             CAUS-do tell-DUP-tell stay
             ‘I taught him for five months.’
   In (52), the non-topic-marked object hme requires a subject, which is
supplied by homkwe ‘2/3PL-TOP’.
     (52) Homkwe hme               iha nonaw         liy nekie way.
            hom-kwe hom-e          iha   non-aw      liy nekie lway
            2/3PL-TOP 2/3PL-OBJ hand CMT-RSTR DYN hold carry
            ‘You can pick them up by hand.’
8.6.2 Agents and patients without syntactic marking
      In (53), the first two NPs are topicalised. Within the predication they
fill the semantic function of respectively agent and patient but they are not
syntactically marked for subject and object. The listener is able to assign
the roles of agent and patient based on the logics of the semantics rather
than word order. (It is possible to reverse the order of the two first NPs
with the same marking). The speaker suppresses in this way the
prominence of both NPs, enabling the time constituent preceding the VP
enekwei kamonaw (in one day) to be the most prominent constituent of the
sentence.
                                                                           327     (53) P2                             P1

     Inanimate nouns can be marked as subject, as has been seen from
previous examples (e.g. (§3.7.1, ex. (87)) and 47). In (54), the head of the
NP an-yeik ‘fishing hook’ is not marked by a topicalised subject pronoun
but by the general topic pronoun hokwe. This lowers the prominence of
this constituent and raises the prominence of the NP object (marked as
object by se).

            ‘But, as for his fishing hook, it hooked a big eel.’
    When the NP is marked by the topicalised subject pronoun hiykwe
‘3S.M-TOP’ the constituent still remains part of the topic part of the
predication, but it raises its prominence.

328    In (56), the NP sok-uwr sohokwe ‘snake-man’ is only pragmatically
marked with the demonstrative topic pronoun. It has the role of agent
within the predication but is not syntactically marked as subject. This
construction raises the prominence of the object NP within the comment
part of the sentence.

     Entities that have not been referred to within a discourse can be
introduced via NPs that are often marked by the numeral one. This is
certainly true for the introduction of animate participants but also true for
the introduction of major props. The numeral prueyn ‘one’ is used for the
introduction of a major human participant (see §8.7.1).
    NPs not mentioned before can be introduced without the use of the
numeral one if the NP is considered to be part of an understood script, i.e.
a known setting, e.g. hunting or fishing, where the presence of certain
items do not need special introduction since they are assumed to be there
(see §8.7.2).
    Once NPs are introduced they are tracked in various ways as described
in §8.7.3.
8.7.1 New entities introduced by the numeral one
    The function of the numeral one is not to mark quantity (although it is
implied) but to establish identity. Out of a field with many possible
candidates, one particular entity is set apart and introduced within the
story. The numeral is not used if the head of the noun phrase can only
refer to one possible candidate (e.g. sun, moon, sea, etc.).
                                                                          329    New major entities introduced within a discourse occur in a marked
noun phrase construction that contains the numeral one. In (57), the NP
uwr prueyn hiykwe ‘a certain man’ refers to a new participant. His identity
as an individual participant is established by the numeral prueyn ‘one’.
The NP is also marked for subject and topic. The NP hyo wueir iwon se ‘a
new garden’ is also a new entity; but the NP can be viewed to be part of
the script ‘garden making’.

            ‘At a certain time, a certain man was making his new garden,
            cutting trees during the day.’
     It is possible to introduce a new participant with (57) or without (58) a
topic marker. When no topic marking occurs the quantifying meaning of
the numeral is also in focus (see also discussion on non-quantifying uses
of the numeral one in §3.4.4).
     In (58), the participant ai ‘fish’ is introduced by the numeral kamon
‘one’ and marked for its grammatical function within the sentence by the
object marker ke. It is placed in the comment part of the sentence and can
therefore not be topicalised. The numeral kamon does double function,
introducing the new participant as well as quantifying the number of fish.

330    Example (59) is taken from a text which describes a number of
accidents that happened when a group of people fell into the water. One
man of the group is singled out now by the use of the numeral one. The NP
is only marked pragmatically and not syntactically. The speaker makes the
nature of the accident (breaking of teeth) the focus of the sentence. The NP
that introduces the participant occurs sentence-initially and is therefore
treated as background information.

             ‘As for a certain man, his teeth were struck and broken off
             completely.’
    New entities can also be introduced in NPs that are marked for
semantic case. In (60), the noun yier ‘place’ is introduced and is marked
by the numeral kamon ‘one’ and the locative mon. The locative noun
phrase occurs in the comment part of the sentence and is therefore not
topicalised.
     In the second sentence the introduced noun yier ‘place’ is referred to
again, this time by the demonstrative topic marker sohokwe since it is no
longer an indefinite entity. As stated before, the demonstrative topic
pronoun never introduces new entities but is used to keep track of already
introduced participants.

8.7.2 New entities introduced without the numeral one
    Not all new entities referred to for the first time within a discourse
need to be introduced by the numeral one. A new entity only requires the
numeral one if there is a need to set it apart from other possibilities. E.g.
in (61) paraw kokwe ‘the past’ is not marked by the numeral one, since
the reference is not understood to have multiple meanings. Also when a
familiar setting assumes the presence of a certain entity, it does not need
to be modified by the numeral one. These entities are part of a script. E.g.
pisu ko-kwe ‘knife GL.F-TOP’ in (61), since all hunters are expected to
carry a knife with them.

             away.’
332    In (62), the first bolded noun phrase had not been referred to in the
discourse, but the context only allows one possible entity for sapa ‘forest’.
If the numeral one had been used here, it would have conveyed the
meaning that the subject fled to a different forest, rather than into the
surrounding forest.
    The second bolded NP introduces the noun ur ‘vine’, which is part of
the script forest. The numeral one is not used, although it could have been
used. The fact that the speaker wanted to place the NP ur hiy ‘the vine’ in
the comment part of the predication possibly impacted choices. New
participants or important props are often introduced with the help of the
numeral one in the topic part of the predication and not in the comment
part. If a NP that hosts the numeral one is not topicalised, its function
becomes blurred. It seems to both quantify and introduce new participants.
The fact that the new entity is not backgrounded but foregrounded and has
agent function helps to build the climax of the story.

8.7.3 Marking on previously introduced definite entities
    Once an entity is introduced, the speaker has a number of reference
options. In comparing first and second occurrence of entities the following
differences are observed. When an introduced entity is referred to again, it
occurs without the numeral one and it may be marked by one of the
following markers:
    a. general demonstrative pronoun (63);
    b. a noun phrase with a personal pronoun as head of the NP (64);
    c. a syntactically marked NP (65).
                                                                        333    In (63), the participants nyo ‘lad’ and woyo ‘fowl’ are introduced with
the help of the numeral one. Both participants are referred to again with
the help of the demonstrative topic pronoun, respectively by the masculine
sohokwe and the feminine sokukwe.
      (63) Paraw kokwe           nyo prueyn hiykwe           woyo-hne

             morning, in the forest. This boy shot a fowl and took it along.
             This fowl was shot with an arrow.’
    NPs consisting of only a third person personal pronoun refer
anaphorically to animate entities. In (64), homkwe ‘2/3PL-TOP’ refers to
the known entity ipey-aio ‘parents’ of the previous sentence.
      (64) Ari hiykwe        ipey-aio         non. Homkwe

     In (65), the entity nwoh ‘dog’ is introduced in the first sentence in a
comitative NP marked by non. In the second sentence this same participant
is referred to with a syntactically marked NP.

            ‘One day Kupe went out with his dog during the night. His
            dog was barking at a pig.’
      An introduced participant might be deleted altogether:
      a.   in predications in which the speaker only wants to express the
           object, because there is no need or desire to express the subject
           (see §8.6);
      b.   in predications with clause sequential markers with an
           understood subject. See (66) and §9.5.4.
    In (66), the first bolded NP introduces a new entity with the numeral
prueyn ‘one’. In subsequent clauses with the sequential marker nok, the
subject NP is understood and zero-marked. Below, the second sentence
refers to the introduced participant with the third person personal pronoun
hiykwe. After the sequential marker nok it can be deleted again. (The
omitted participant is indicated by Ø.)

within narrative discourse
     As stated before, the sentence has an obligatory comment component
and is nearly always preceded by a topic component. Sentences form
discourses; and within a discourse distinctions can be made between
backgrounded and foregrounded sentences. The climax of a discourse has
its own features.
8.8.1 Backgrounding within discourse
     Backgrounding within a discourse is marked by clauses that display
very little syntactic marking. Constructions without a VP (§6.2) or with the
stative verb lwak ‘to be’ (§6.3), the use of NPs with only pragmatic
marking (§3.6.1) are typical within sentences that are part of
backgrounded text within a discourse. General time indications or local
settings often belong in this latter group.
    The four sentences in (67) are all analysed as backgrounded text.
None of them contains a syntactically marked NP in the comment
component of the predication. The one entity with patient role within the
predication uwrsa mo pion mokwe ‘people’s flesh’ is not marked for
object but is marked by the general topic marker. In the last sentence the
agent huok sohokwe ‘this pig’ is not marked for subject but it is
pragmatically marked by the demonstrative topic pronoun.

           there).’
    Examples (68)-(69) are consecutive sentences from the same text.
Example (68) starts with a clause formed with the stative verb lwak
followed by a verbless clause. Two clauses are constructed with the
manner adverb senkin which gives the clause features that are similar to
verbless clauses (see §3.11.4). In (69), the change from background to
foreground is signalled by the presence of the syntactic marker hiykwe
‘3S.M.SUB.TOP’ in the last sentence followed by the non-topicalised object
NP hyo wueir se ‘his garden’.","[320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350]"
"     It is suggested in this grammar that the difference between the
pragmatic and syntactic marking of the topicalised NPs that consist of only
a pronoun has been neutralized. Some data seem to suggest that the set of
personal subject pronouns can be used to mark only topic, and not subject.
For instance, it is possible for the same topicalised pronoun to occur twice
in one sentence. In (45), the initial personal pronoun hakwe ‘I’ only
introduces the entity as a topic that will be commented on. The second
hakwe is a syntactic argument in the clause, functioning as the syntactic
subject.
       (45)            NP[+TOP] NP[+TOP]                      S[+TOP]

            dream lie.down see night
            ‘Woman, as for me, last night I had a dream.’
     A NP consisting of only a personal pronoun is analysed on the basis of
its position within the clause. In (45) the first hakwe ‘I’ is followed by
another topicalised NP and as a result one may conclude that the NP hakwe
‘I’ is not marked for subject, but only for topic. The further a personal
pronoun is located to the left, the higher the probability that the personal
pronoun is introduced only as a topic, and the subject role is not in focus
(see §8.3.3 for other examples). The further a personal pronoun is placed
to the right, the higher the probability that the subject role is in focus.
When the subject NP consisting of a personal pronoun is not topicalised,
the NP is prominent.
    The subject personal pronoun ha ‘I’ in (46) is not marked for topic. It
therefore occurs in the comment part of the clause. Its subject function is
very much in focus.
206      (46) NP[+TOP]              NP[+TOP]                        S[-TOP]

            IMM.FUT eat FUT
            ‘Today, as for his meat, I am about to eat it.’
    As stated above, NPs consisting of a topicalised personal pronoun
could be analysed as having both syntactic and pragmatic marking, or as
having only pragmatic marking. Their position within the clause is the
determining factor. The personal pronoun NP needs to be followed by at
least one other topicalised constituent before it can be analysed as a
constituent that has lost its syntactic role.
    The NP homkwe in (47) hosts the subject personal pronoun hom and
the topic marker -kwe. Since the topicalised NP immediately precedes a
phrase that is not topicalised (wayh seme ‘these yams’) one can conclude
that the topicalised NP homkwe ‘you’ functions as the subject of the
clause.

6.5.3 Inclusion of indirect object NP
     In ditransitive clauses the marking on the NP object and NP indirect
object is identical. The neutral or most frequently observed order of the
two arguments has the indirect object preceding the direct object, as in
(48). This feature of Abau syntax is consistent with the universal tendency
for indirect objects to precede direct objects, since indirect objects tend to
be higher on the animacy hierarchy (Hopper and Thompson
                                                                          2071980: 259-261). Usually indirect objects are [+human, +animate], in
contrast to direct objects, which are usually [-human, ranimate].

            grubs-dried 3S.M-OBJ ACC-place BEN eat
            ‘His friend gave him semi-dried grubs to eat.’
    In (48), neither direct object nor indirect object is topicalised by -kwe.
They both mark information that the speaker treats as new. It is possible to
topicalise the indirect object and not the object. In (49), the topicalised
indirect object precedes the topicalised subject, while the object
immediately precedes the verb phrase without any topic marking. This
construction reduces the prominence of the recipient and raises the
prominence of the patient, since it is the only non-topicalised role within
the clause.

            ‘In regard to her old husband, she cooked a big eel for him.’
     Although the indirect object usually precedes the direct object, the
speaker can move the indirect object closer to the verb phrase. The result
is that the prominence of the recipient is raised at the expense of the
prominence of the patient. In (50), the direct object (hno yeyk se kokwe) is
treated as given information, but the indirect object (hane) as new
information.
208       (50) Hunkwe        hno      yeyk se             kokwe

            1S-OBJ.TOP HORT speak give

    In (50), the direct object is topicalised. One could delete the topic
marker kokwe as is done in (51) and still have a grammatically correct
sentence. The speaker now treats both the patient and the recipient as new
information.

            ‘You, just give your canoe to me.’
    It is relatively rare though, to have two object NPs following each
other which are both not topicalised, since it means that the speaker gives
prominence to two NPs at the same time. Normally the speaker treats only
one NP constituent as new information. More discussion on decreasing or
increasing the prominence of sentence constituents is given in §8.6.
6.5.4 Constituents that can follow a non-topicalised
object NP
     The object NP in a transitive clause tends to be the new information
the speaker wants to convey, and as a result the speaker will move this NP
towards the VP. It is therefore most often the object NP that immediately
precedes the verb phrase. It is possible for the subject NP to immediately
precede the verb if the speaker want to give more prominence to the agent
than to the object NP. However, as we saw above, the OSV order requires
that the object NP becomes topicalised.
      There are three constituents that can follow a non-topicalised object
NP and immediately precede the verb phrase. Since they follow a non-
                                                                       209topicalised NP, they cannot be topicalised as well. The three clause
constituents are:
    1. Adverbial, demonstrative and interrogative modifiers
         (§4.4, §4.4.2 and §7.5.3). Ex.(52) and (53);
    2. Incorporated nouns (§3.11.1). Ex. (54) and (55);
    3. Postpositional noun phrases (§3.9). Ex. (56), (57), (58)
         and (59).","[219, 220, 221, 222, 223]"
"4.2.1.1 Preferred order of verbal prefixes
     The preferred order of verbal prefixes observed in natural texts is
summarised in Table 35. The prefixes kor- ‘LIM’ and hiy- ‘CAUS’ have
been placed on separate levels of the table, since their ordering in relation
to the other prefixes could not be established. These two prefixes have not
been observed to co-occur with kiy- ‘ACT’, saw- ‘SPD’, non- ‘DU’ or with
each other.

                                  ‘CAUS’
Directional prefixes do not co-occur with each other and always precede
all non-directional verbal prefixes. While the relative ordering of the
prefixes in Table 35 is established, there are no examples of a complete
string of all possible combinations. Examples (13), (14) and (15)
demonstrate the ordering of prefixes in natural speech.
    Manner prefixes can co-occur, e.g. (13): ma- ‘RPT’, non- ‘DU’ and
nak- ‘ACC’ with the verb nekiok- ‘crawl’.
134       (13) Hoh     naw non-mayr lowpway            nok nok, yier

             slowly back together (with sago) to the village in the
             afternoon.’
      Up to four verbal prefixes can co-occur as (14) illustrates.

              (nak- indicates that the screaming was accompanied by

    Directional prefixes do not co-occur with each other, but a directional
prefix can co-occur with manner prefixes, as in (15), where the directional
prefix am- ‘near’ co-occurs with the modal prefixes saw- ‘SPD’ and nak-
‘ACC’.

4.3     The structure of the verb phrase
     The Abau verb phrase consists of members that come from three
distinct constituent categories. The only nuclear constituent is a minimum
of one verb from the first constituent category. Up to four verbs from this
category have been observed to co-occur within the verb phrase. The
second category consists of general qualifiers that qualify the verb for
quality or quantity. They cannot occur by themselves within the verb
phrase. The third category consists of a variety of modifiers that deal with
the three subcategories of participant interaction, time and appraisal of
process. The three subcategories can all be represented in a single verb
phrase and mostly in the order given, though exceptions to this ordering
have been observed.
     As stated before, the perfective and imperfective are marked by
intonation contour. The basic contrast is the pitch over the final syllable of
the verb phrase. A large number of verb phrases only consist of members
of category one, but many verb phrases will also host members of
category two and three. The last constituent of the verb phrase is marked
for perfective or imperfective. This is not true when speech markers and
negation markers are added to the sentence. These markers are not part of
the verb phrase, but they (rather than the verb final constituent)
distinguish between perfective and imperfective (see §7.3 and §7.4).
    Table 36 shows the three categories of constituent members along
with a number of examples. It should be noted that the lists of words
under the three subcategories of the third group are exhaustive. The
examples under the second category however, are part of a much larger
group with many members.
    The three categories in Table 36 can be labeled as follows: category 1:
one or more verbs; category 2: qualifying adverbial modifiers; category 3:
reciprocal, temporal and evaluative modifiers.

numbers above the constituents of the verb phrase indicate to what type of
verb constituent they belong. They refer to the three categories outlined in
Table 36.

   At least one single verb occurs obligatorily in the VP. Qualifiers and
modifiers can follow optionally.

and process evaluation can occur together as is shown in (19).

    The evaluative markers of the third category liok and lokruok mostly
occur verb phrase finally. This is true for liok in (19) but example (20)
with lokruok demonstrates that these evaluative markers do not always
occur verb phrase finally. By placing the evaluative marker lokruok after
the verb lira ‘see’ this verb becomes the scope and focus of the evaluative
marker.

4.3.1 Verb phrase head
    Verbs function as the head of verb phrases. As described in §4.2.1,
only verbs host verbal prefixes. Up to four verbs may occur as the
compound head of the VP.","[147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152]"

    The topic in a verbless clause can be marked by plural (1) and
singular masculine (2) or singular feminine (3) NP topic markers.
       (1) An har        mo          woki    mokwe      aiopey.

       (3) Pisu kokwe           haraw.
            pisu ko-kwe haraw
            knife GL.F-TOP short
            ‘As for the knife, it is short.’
     Verbless clauses always have a topic constituent marked by -kwe. In
(4), the topic NP is marked by the NP topic marker mokwe.
        (4) How har        mokwe        weyspey.
              how har      mo-kwe       weyspey
              taro some GL.PL-TOP white
              ‘As for some taros, they are white.’
    A topic constituent cannot be marked for the syntactic roles of subject
or object in a verbless clause. Example (5) is ill-formed, because the topic
NP is marked as a subject NP, which is incorrect in a verbless clause.
       (5) *How har          homkwe weyspey.
             how har         hom-kwe weyspey
             taro    some 2/3PL-TOP white
             ‘Some taros are white.’
    The topic constituent in a verbless clause can occur with a
postposition, as in (6) below. (Topic refers to topic constituents; comment
refers to the comment part of the clause which never has any topic
marking by definition.)

            ‘Long ago, in everyone’s villages, we did not have the white
            men’s birds (= chickens).’
    In (6), the underlined locative NP marked by the postposition mon fills
the role of topic constituent. Like all topic constituents, this type of topic
constituent is also obligatorily topicalised. However, it can only be
topicalised by the singular feminine NP topic marker kokwe. The
masculine gender of yier ‘place’ does not impact the topic marker, since
yier ‘place’ is marked by the locative marker mon. This phenomenon
takes place for all NPs marked for a semantic role. They can only be
topicalised by the topic marker kokwe, regardless of the gender and
number of the head of the NP.
It should also be noted that the topic part of a verbless clause can consist
of more than one topic constituent as the example above shows. In (6)
above, a temporal noun phrase and a locative noun phrase are both
separately topicalised. These two topicalised NPs form together the topic
part of the verbal clause.
    In (7), the comitative NP marked by non fills the role of topic
constituent. The phrase is topicalised by the topic marker kokwe.

    Modifiers (1) or noun phrases that contain a modifier (2), as well as
the comitative NP (8) and the similarity NP (9) have been observed to
function in the comment slot of verbless clauses. The comment slot of a
clause is always defined as the part that contains non-topicalised
constituent(s).
    In (8), the topic constituent is topicalised by the feminine topic
demonstrative sokukwe. The comment slot is filled by a comitative NP,
ney non ‘with child’.

     Although rare, it is possible to only state the comment part of a clause.
This comment part is by definition not topicalised. This construction is
used for titles of stories, or for short headings that only name the subject
that will be discussed.

6.3.1 Stative verb relating comment to topic
    The stative verb lwak ‘to be’ can be placed after comment constituents
with minimal semantic difference. Its presence basically changes an
utterance stated in absolute terms (13) into an utterance that is placed into
a time frame (14). (The verb lwak is marked for imperfective.)
      (13) Wawp        mokwe       weyspey.
             wawp      mo-kwe      weyspey
             bird.sp GL.PL-TOP white
             ‘As for wawp birds, they are white.’ (General truth stated
             absolutely.)
      (14) Wawp        mokwe       weyspey lwâk.
             wawp      mo-kwe      weyspey lwak
             bird.sp GL.PL-TOP white          be. IPFTV
             ‘As for wawp birds, they are being white.’ (A present truth
             that may or may not change.)
     The presence of the existential verb lwak in (14) gives the comment a
time reference. Comrie (1976: 103-106) describes the difference in terms
of the distinction between contingent state and absolute state. In (14), the
existential verb lwak marks the whiteness of the birds as contingent. This
fact can potentially change whereas the absence of the stative verb lwak in
                                                                         193(13) gives the utterance an absolute timeless truth value. Compare also
(10) and (17) where (10), without lwak, states a timeless truth or state of
affairs. There is no indication that the state described was ever different.
Example (17) places the predicate in a time frame which suggests
uncertainty whether this state was different in the past or will be different
in the future.
    Existential clauses encode temporary, contingent conditions. The
topic constituent is by definition topicalised. The verb lwak ‘to be’ relates
the comment to the topic in terms of characteristics.
      (15) Pruam          mokwe        ahney me          hieyn-aw lwâk.
             pruam        mo-kwe       ahney m-e         hieyn-aw lwak

             fowl PL-GEN leg GL.PL-TOP short be. IPFTV
             ‘As for the legs of fowls, they are short.’
    In (17), two topics are given and the comment yaprue ‘good’ fits with
either one.
      (17) Enkin kokwe           aio      so            irowp hokwe
             enkin ko-kwe aio             s-o           irowp ho-kwe

             good      be. IPFTV
             ‘At this time, as for father’s arm, it is alright.’
    Existential clauses having the verb lwak can occur with a topic marker
and be either marked or unmarked for subject. In (18), the topic
constituent is marked with the NP subject marker hom ‘2/3pl’ which is
suffixed with the topic marker -kwe. The verb lwak can be marked for the
imperfective (18) or perfective (19).
      (18) Wawp        homkwe weyspey lwâk
            Wawp hom-kwe weyspey lwak
            bird.sp 2/3PL-TOP white          be. IPFTV

           bird.sp 2/3PL-TOP white be.PFTV
           ‘Wawp birds were white’
6.3.2 Existential verb relating topic and comment
     If lwak ‘to be’ relates the topic to the comment in terms of
characteristics, it can be deleted. See (13) and (14). If lwak ‘to be’ relates
the topic to the comment in terms of time or location, it cannot be deleted.
In (20), the verb lwak functions not as a stative verb that relates the topic
with characteristics, but as an intransitive verb that relates the topic with
location. The verb lwak relates the comment (the locative NP) to the topic
(a participant within the story). The motion verb lanio ‘walk’ in (21)
fulfils a similar function in regard to location.
       (20) Huok kamon aiopey hokwe                  ki        sapa kamon
              huok kamon aiopey ho-kwe               ki        sapa kamon

              LOC be
             ‘As for a certain big pig, it was (= lived) in a certain forest
             area.’
       (21) Huok kamon aiopey hokwe                  ki        sapa kamon
              huok kamon aiopey ho-kwe               ki        sapa kamon
              pig     one      big       GL.M-TOP ground forest one
              mon lanio.
              mon lanio
              LOC walk
             ‘As for a certain big pig, it walked in a certain forest area.’
    The verb lwak ‘to be’ has the existential meaning ‘to live’ in contexts
that refer to time and location. This was already shown in (20) where a
topicalised participant was related to a comment that expressed location. It
is also possible to topicalise the location or temporal and relate this
constituent to a comment that signals the participant. If this is done, the
modifier senkin ‘DDEM-MAN’ is obligatorily present preceding lwak.
   In (23) and (22) the topic constituents relate respectively to location
and time. In order to relate these topic constituents to a comment
                                                                        195constituent that signals an animate participant, the manner demonstrative
senkin needs to precede lwak.

             ‘A long time ago, a certain son of an eagle lived thus.’6.4     Verbal clauses
     The verbal clause is discussed in the following sections, starting with
the most nuclear part of the clause: the verb phrase. More phrase
constituents will be added to the verb phrase in the following sections,
starting with non-topicalised constituents that have no syntactic or
semantic case marking, working towards a fully developed verbal clause
that has constituents that display all variations of topic, syntactic and
semantic markings. In the examples below all the verb phrases are
underlined for easy recognition.
6.4.1 Verbal clause consisting only of VP and modal
marker
    A verbal clause can consist of just a VP often accompanied by a modal
marker in order to make a meaningful expression. In (24), the verb phrase
is preceded by the prohibitive peie followed by a speech marker. In (25),
the verb phrase is preceded by the hortative marker kwa.
      (24) Peie lira o!
            peie lira o
            PROH see EMPH.SP.IPFTV
            ‘Don’t look!’
196      (25) Kwa ley!
           kwa ley
           HOR go
           ‘Go!’
6.4.2 Verbal clause consisting of VP preceded by an
adverb or incorporated noun
    The VP in a verbal clause can be modified by an adverb that precedes
the verb phrase as in (26) or by an adverbial interrogative as in (27). (See
for more discussion §4.4 and §7.5.3)
      (26) Yaprue hin         e!
            yaprue hin       e
            well      shoot OBJ
            ‘Shoot well!’
      (27) Paneke hakan ko?
            paneke hakan ko
            why       flee     Q.SP.PFTV.F
            ‘Why did you (female) flee?’
    Incorporated nouns, i.e. nouns that work in close corporation with a
verb to establish one single meaning will precede the verb phrase without
any syntactic or other marking. In (28), the noun kar ‘happiness’ occurs
without any marking. Incorporated nouns always precede the verb phrase
unless a modal marker like kwa ‘HOR’ intervenes. (See also §3.11.1)
      (28) Kar           kwa ley e.
            kar          kwa ley e
            happiness HOR go OBJ
            ‘Be happy.’
6.4.3 Verbal clause including non-syntactic topicalised
constituents
     A verbal clause can be further extended by topicalised constituents
that do not display any syntactic or semantic case marking. It was noted in
§6.2 that verbless clauses consist of a topic and a comment part. The topic
part of the verbless clause is mostly filled by a topicalised noun phrase
and the comment part is often filled by a non-topicalised modifier. This
internal clause division of a topicalised part and a comment part can be
found in verbal clauses as well. The topicalised part is nearly always
                                                                          197expressed, but if it is not (like in §6.4.1 and §6.4.2) it is always
understood. When the topicalised part is expressed, the topicalised
constituent(s) will host the topic marker -kwe. In (29), the topic part of the
clause is filled by the topicalised NP yeyk ohokwe ‘this canoe’. The rest of
the clause is the comment part of the clause (see §8.4).
      (29) Topic                        Comment
              Yeyk ohokwe               yaprue meio popriy pa!
              yeyk o-ho-kwe             yaprue meio popriy pa
              canoe PDEM-GL.M-TOP good            work well        NEG.PFTV
              ‘You did not make this canoe well!’
     The topic part of the sentence can be filled by a personal pronoun as
in (30).
      (30) Topic           Comment
            Hunkwe         yaprue lwak o?
            hwon-kwe yaprue lwak o
            2S.SUB-TOP well          be    Q.SP.IPFTV
            ‘Are you well?’
It needs to be noted that topicalised nominal personal pronouns can be
analysed as either topicalised subjects (marked both syntactically and
pragmatically) or as personal pronouns that are only pragmatically marked
for topic and not for subject. See discussion in §6.5.2.
    The topic part of a clause can be filled by more than one NP. In (31), a
topicalised temporal phrase (pokon kokwe) and a topicalised subject
phrase (hakwe) form together the topic part of the sentence.
      (31) Topic               Topic          Comment
            Pokon kokwe        hakwe          liwak nieys kok          ey.
            pokon ko-kwe ha-kwe               liwak nieys kok          ey
            today GL.F-TOP 1S.SUB-TOP sit            rest day.time INTN
            ‘Today, as for me, I intend to sit down and rest during the
            day.’
6.4.4 Verbal clause including constituents marked for
semantic case
    Semantic case marking is realised by postpositional phrases. A
postpositional locative noun phrase can occur in the topic part of a clause,
as in (32). The postpositional phrase yier serey mon kokwe is marked for
198location by mon and for topic by kokwe. The NP hiykwe is marked for
topic and subject.
      (32) Topic          Topic
            Hiykwe        yier serey         mon kokwe
            hiy-kwe       yier so-rey        mon ko-kwe
            3S.M.SUB-TOP place DDEM-THERE LOC GL.F-TOP
            Comment
            uwr        prueyn se             kar        ley.
            uwr        prueyn s-e            kar        ley
            man        one       3S.M-OBJ gladness go
            ‘As for that place, he really liked one person (there).’
    A postpositional noun phrase is not always topicalised. Postpositional
noun phrases like the Accompaniment NP and the Comparative NP (see
§3.9.5 and §3.9.6) are often not, since their semantic meaning makes them
more candidates for the comment part of the clause.
     The Accompaniment NP (hano aio se nion) and the Comparative NP
(aio se hieyn) are not topicalised; therefore, they are part of the comment
in (33) and (34) respectively.
      (33) Topic       Comment
             Hakwe hano           aio     se         nion ley.

             1S-TOP 1S-GEN father 3S.M-OBJ ACC go
             ‘I am going with my father.’
      (34) Topic       Comment
             Hakwe aio            se          hieyn liy lanio ley.

             1S-TOP father        3S.M-OBJ COMP DYN walk NEG
             ‘I cannot walk like father.’
    Locative NPs are often topicalised when they contain background
information, but they occur without topic marking when they are part of
the comment as in (35).
      (35) Topic                               Comment
            Huok kamon aiopey hokwe            ki       sapa kamon

            mon lanio
            LOC walk
             ‘As for a certain big pig, it walked in a certain forest area.’
6.4.5 Verbal clause including constituents marked for
syntactic case
    NPs can be marked for subject and object. If they occur in the topic
part of the sentence, they have topic marking as well. If they occur in the
comment part of the sentence, they are without topic marking.
    Example (36) displays normal SOV order: a topicalised subject and a
non-topic marked object followed by the verb phrase. An indirect object is
not expressed but signalled by the benefactive kow.
      (36) Topic                                 Comment
            Hyo         wayh hiykwe              hopion se
            hiy-o       wayh hiy-kwe             hopion   s-e
            3S.M-GEN friend 3S.M.SUB-TOP pig.meat 3S.M-OBJ
            nak-yay            kow.
            nak-lyay           kow.
            ACC-place.down BEN.
            ‘His friend brought meat.’
    The inclusion of the recipient hye ‘3S.M.OBJ’ does not cause any
syntactic changes for the other constituents of the clause in (37). It should
be noted that the direct object and indirect object are both marked by the
same object marker -e.
     (37) Topic                                   Comment
            Hyo          wayh hiykwe              hye         hopion
            hiy-o        wayh hiy-kwe             hiy-e       hopion
            3S.M-GEN friend 3S.M.SUB-TOP 3S.M-OBJ pig.meat
            se          nak-yay            kow.
            s-e         nak-lyay           kow.
            3S.M-OBJ ACC-place.down BEN.
            ‘His friend brought him meat.’
   One may exchange the positions of the subject and object to give a
more prominent role to the subject. In OSV order, the object NP is nearly
always topicalised and the subject NP is not, because the subject is treated
200as new information as is shown in (38). (For more discussion, see
counterexample of a non-topicalised fronted object NP (19) in §8.4, and
also §6.5.1 and §8.6.)
      (38) Topic                           Comment

             ‘As for Keno, a vine tangled him causing him to fall in the

     The verb phrase is the only obligatory element in the verbal clause.
Neutral order in Abau is SOV, but this order can readily be altered for
pragmatic reasons. Background or given information is placed at the

prominent information is placed preceding the verb phrase. The phrase
that immediately precedes the VP forms the comment of the utterance.","[202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214]"

new or foreground information. Constituents containing new information
are never topicalised and precede the verb phrase. Topicalised constituents
conveying given information are found clause-initially. A topicalised
constituent can only precede, not follow, a non-topicalised constituent
within the clause.
6.5.1 Positioning of subject and object
    Neutral or frequently observed order within the clause places the
subject before the object. The verb phrase occurs clause-finally. In (39),
the object kuey me ‘grubs PL-OBJ’ follows the subject hano sa ko orih
hiykwe ‘my wife’s father’.
     (39) S[+TOP]
            Hano     sa       ko         orih   hiykwe

             ‘My wife’s father cut the grubs (from the inside of the sago
            palm).’
    Placing kuey me ‘grubs OBJ’ before hano sa ko orih hiy (my wife’s
father) yields a syntactically ill-formed structure.

             ‘The grubs were cut by my wife’s father.’
     The order of subject and object can be reversed, and that nearly
always results in the topicalisation of the object NP. As a result of the
reversal the subject will immediately precede the verb phrase and cannot
be topicalised any longer. In (41), kuey me ‘grubs PL-OBJ’ is marked by
the feminine topic marker kokwe and precedes the non-topicalised subject.
As a result the subject becomes more prominent and emphasised.

            ‘(It was) my wife’s father (who) cut the grubs.
    A topicalised constituent that functions as patient within the
predication is not obligatorily marked for object. In (42), kuey mokwe has
the semantic function of patient, but is not marked by the plural object
marker me, but by the plural topic marker mokwe. Grammatically it is not
marked as the object of the clause, but rather as a sentential topic that will
be commented on.

    Animate objects can be placed clause-initially as well. In (43) the
indirect object consisting of the object personal pronoun hye ‘3S.M.OBJ’
precedes the non-topicalised NP subject.

and are therefore placed clause-initially and topicalised. They are only
found in the comment part of the clause if the temporal or the locative is
treated as new information.
    In (44), the NP enekwei kamon hokwe ‘one day’ is treated as
background information within the sentence where it occurs. Therefore it
is not marked syntactically or semantically, only pragmatically. The NP
John hiykwe ‘John 3S.M.SUB-TOP’ is a topicalised subject. The object is
syntactically marked by me but is not topicalised. The incorporated noun
yokun ‘theft’ that precedes the verb phrase is by definition not marked for
object (§3.11.1).

6.5.2 Pragmatic and syntactic marking on NPs consisting
of a personal pronoun
    It needs to be noted again that NPs with a noun as head can be marked
in more diverse ways than NPs that consist only of a personal pronoun.
NPs which have a noun as head are marked by a separate final noun phrase
marker while NPs that consist only of a personal pronoun often do not
have such a separate NP marker. For the latter group syntactic information
is in most cases not marked by a separate marker, but carried by the
personal pronoun itself.
    Secondly, there is a wide range of NP final markers for NPs with a
noun as the head of the NP. These markers give the NP a pragmatic role, or
a syntactic role, or both. The range of options of NP markers for NPs that
have only a personal pronoun as head is more limited. Table 43 gives an
overview of the various markings on NPs with a noun as head of the NP,
versus NP with only a personal pronoun as head of the NP. When studying

9.5.8 Temporal cohesion: a limited time span
    The temporal notion ‘until’ combines temporal duration with a time
limit. It is manifested as follows:
    a. the initial clause contains the manner adverb senkinaw;
    b. the final clause encodes a temporal limit and is marked for the
          perfective;
    c. the final clause does not have topic-marked constituents.
    Example (74) has all these characteristics: The first clause contains
the restrictive manner adverb senkinaw to express the idea of duration.
The second clause has no topicalised constituents and is marked for the
perfective. The two clauses together express the concept of ‘until’.
      (74) Arawh mei-a-mei            senkinaw            nuw-kuw

             morning.PFTV
             ‘The whole long night he kept dancing, until the sun came
             up.’
     Sentences that express an event or state over a limited time span need
at least two clauses to express this notion. This particular construction is
problematic in its clausal analysis. Subordinate clauses never follow the
main clause, unless the subordinated clause is in tail (P3) position. The
latter is not a possible analysis here, because it is not possible to reverse
the order of the clauses, as can normally be done with P3 constituents.
382Also the tail should not contain new information as the second clause in
the construction above clearly does.
     Alternatively, analysing the first clause as a subordinate clause is also
problematic. This is because the first clause has no final clause marking
that is comparable to other subordinate clauses, but ends with a VP, like all
verbal main clauses.
    In spite of their dependence on each other, it is deemed best to treat
both clauses as main clauses which together express the concept of ‘until’.
     In (75), the first clause occurs with the restrictive manner adverb
senkinaw to express duration. This time the first clause is not marked by
the imperfective as in (74), but by the modal marker ey ‘INTN’ which often
has future reference. The second clause is marked for the perfective.
Together they express the concept of ‘until’.
       (75) Heyn sohokwe                hano     lian mon-aw

           10. Discourse types10.1 General discourse features and
organisation
   Common features of nearly all oral and written discourses include:
      1. an introduction;
      2. a plot or a theme with its supporting arguments;
      3. a conclusion.
    Many texts also have a final formulaic closing statement, which often
includes the restrictive manner adverb senkinaw ‘that is all’. For some
discourse genres the introduction and conclusion can be as short as one
sentence.
   Discourses are organised either
       a. iconically, mirroring the order of events in the real world; or
       b. thematically around major topics and supporting points.
Iconically ordered narrative discourses and legends usually have a plot
(build-up, crisis, resolution) for the main body of the discourse. Other
discourse genres (descriptive, explanatory, hortatory) have a set of
supporting points or arguments centred around a macro-theme. Even
though either time-iconicity or thematicity is the primary organising
strategy, most discourses manifest elements of both strategies.
10.1.1 Introduction to discourse
    Introductions often convey background or known information, so it is
not surprising that introductions in discourses are generously sprinkled
with topic markers.
    Example (1) is taken from the introduction of a letter (§11.7). It
consists of two clauses separated by a comma. Both clauses have their
                                   383
384own topic and comment part. The constituents of the topic part of each
clause have been marked by P1 and P2. The remaining part of each clause
is marked comment.
       (1) P1       Comment         CONJ                   P2

    Example (2) consists of two clauses each with its own topic and
comment part. It is taken from the first line of an expository text. All the
P1 and P2 constituents are topic-marked.

        a. acknowledgement of the addressee(s);
        b. the speaker’s self-identification;
        c. an introduction to the contents to be presented;
        d. a reference to the context in which the message is
             communicated.
    Example (2) above constitutes an introduction to the contents of an
expository text. The introduction also contains a reference to the context
in which the message is communicated enekwei enkin ohokwe ‘this
present time’. The addressees’ and the speaker’s identification have been
combined in the word hromkwe ‘we’.
   Example (3) is taken from a procedural text (§11.3). The addressee
hunkwe ‘you’ is acknowledged and an introduction in regard to the
message is given (how to build a house).
      (3) Hunkwe        a       meio ankin, hunkwe

            ‘When you build a house, this is how you start out.’
     Example (4) is taken from the story of “The two brothers” (§11.1.1).
The acknowledgement of the addressee and the identification of the
speaker are collapsed in the pronoun hromkwe (we). This introduction
references both the content (i.e. story of the two brothers) and the context
within which it is communicated (which includes speaker and listeners,
and also the temporal deictic centre of the current moment, when the story
is being told).

     The main point of hortatory and expository texts, and also letters, is
normally not revealed in the introduction, and not even early in the body
of the text. The main point of these three text types is often subjective and
might be controversial. The speaker tries to anticipate and overcome
potential resistance with introductory observations and statements. Only
after stating these presuppositions will the speaker make his main point.
(Examples are given in the sections dealing with hortatory and expository
texts, and letters.)
    This is not the case with procedural and descriptive texts, since their
contents are mostly non-controversial and neutral. The theme of the text is
therefore often mentioned in the introduction. The topic of procedural
texts and descriptive texts can often be contained in a noun phrase or short
clause. See (3) and (5).
    Example (5) is taken from a descriptive text (§11.4) which was
produced as a written text. The author gave it a title consisting of one non-
topicalised NP that immediately relays the theme of the descriptive text.
The title is sufficient introduction, so the description of the topic starts
immediately in the next sentence. This is realised by a clause formed with
the stative verb lwak ‘be’.

    The introduction to the content in time-iconic ordered texts often
takes the form of
    a. a temporal (nearly always) or spatial setting, or
    b. an introduction of the principal participants.
    Example (6) is taken from a non-fiction narrative which was produced
as a written text. The time setting and the participants are introduced as
background information and are therefore topicalised. The first line
functions as an introduction to the story, but it also starts the story line.
The second sentence moves the story line further along, which is
exemplified by the fact that there is only one short topicalised constituent
in the topic part of the clause versus various constituents in the long
comment part of the sentence.

388     Example (7) is taken from the beginning of a story. The first sentence
is framed with the stative verb lwak which is an indicator of background
information. Two topicalised NPs give the setting for the comment that is
expressed by the comment part of the first sentence. It is important to note
that in the second sentence the participant ohi-weys prueyn ‘a white
person’ is not introduced as background information. The second sentence
has no topicalised constituents and the newly introduced participant is
marked for subject. This is a clear indication that the story line has
changed from background to foreground and that this sentence points
towards a climactic event within the story line.

    An introduction to the contents of a thematically oriented text is
usually done in the very beginning of the text with a clearly stated
reference to the global theme. In (8) and (9), the author introduces the
theme for the whole discourse in the opening sentence and then continues
to give details related to this theme.

     Introductions to thematic texts can be very short since they are
basically given to introduce the theme. In (9), the author has a very short
introduction with only one topicalised NP hakwe (I) in the opening

39010.1.2 Iconic organisation in narrative and procedural
texts
    If an Abau speaker’s communicative goal is to narrate or list a series
of events, he or she will encode these events in sentences using temporal
phrases, which chain the sentences in a coherent temporally ordered
pattern. Changes in spatial and temporal settings and participants are
significant elements in these discourses and may indicate new segments
within a discourse.
     Of these last three elements, the change in temporal setting is the most
important indicator of a discourse break in narrative texts. NPs that may
mark a discourse section break are temporal NPs that are modified by the
numeral one e.g. enekwei kamon ‘a certain day’, wik kamon ‘a certain
week’ etc. Other temporal changes include predications that place the
story line in a different time setting with a temporal constituent that is not
dependent for its meaning on the rest of the discourse, e.g. a reference to a
date or to a known time period, like childhood, the days of the ancestors,
the day someone died, etc. In procedural texts the logical order rather than
the temporal order is in focus, although they might overlap.
    Examples (10) and (11) are consecutive sentences in a story. The
temporal phrase enekwei kamon hokwe ‘a certain time’ starts a new
section within the discourse in (10). The next sentence (11) is part of the
same paragraph, since it contains two references or links to the first
sentence. Firstly, the temporal clause marked by menkin ‘when’ gives
further detail to the time phrase already mentioned in (10). Secondly, the
adverbial demonstrative sehe anaphorically refers to the previous sentence
and establishes a logical connection between this sentence (10) and the
main clause it occurs in.
      (10) Enekwei kamon hokwe,             aio     hiykwe     a

     A number of devices can be used to mark time within a text. These
time indications help to structure the text into a logical sequence of
events. Subordinate clauses with clause-final markers can mark time, e.g.
nok ‘SEQ’, menkin ‘when’, ankin ‘as/while’ (§9.5). Internal markers
within the verb phrase also mark time, e.g. nayr ‘night’, kok ‘day time’
etc. (§4.3.3.3). Temporal NPs like enekwei sohokwe ‘(at) that time’ or
postpositional phrases (§3.9) are also used to mark or sequence time
within a discourse.
    Examples (12) through (14) are part of the same text. All constituents
that mark time have been bolded. In (12), the marker nok ‘SEQ’ places the
events in the first clause in sequential order: The Yabru man (lit. river-
man) spoke after they all ate. The temporal adverb kok ‘day time’ places
the given command in a time frame.
      (12) Hom ai          la lowpway         nok, Yawpruw seirpey

392    In (13), the marker seseyn ‘it was done accordingly’ anaphorically
refers to the command given in the previous sentence. It has therefore
cohesive function and helps to keep track of the sequential order of the
various events. The temporal adverb kok ‘daytime’ and the temporal NP
enekwei sohokwe ‘that day’, supply the events of the sentence they occur
in with a time setting.

time frame for the event described in the main clause.

    Procedural texts are often concerned with sequence rather than time,
although the two overlap. The sequential marker nok, or postpositional
phrases that indicate sequence, e.g. meyki mon ‘after’ are used very
frequently. The adverbial verb phrase modifier pie ‘firstly’ also helps to
                                                                       393sequence events. These sequence indicators are demonstrated in (15) and

10.1.3 Thematically organised texts
    Thematically organised discourses and texts include descriptions,
expositions, hortatory discourses and letters. Rather than centring around
the activities of participants, they centre around a global theme supported
by local topics. Examples are listed below, including the appropriate
section of the appendix: a descriptive text about a certain type snake
(§11.4); an expository text about divorce (§11.5); a hortatory text about
care for a local aid post (§11.6).
394    In text types where opinion or persuasive argumentation are central,
the speaker will make use of hortative commands and hypothetical
questions to mark paragraph boundaries and even episode boundaries.
    Some connectives and conjunctions are very useful in building up
propositions that will support a certain premise or opinion. Examples
include:
    x Frequent use of inclusive devices. E.g. the use of hromkwe ‘we’;
         or the connective seyr ‘and also’ that joins constituents of equal
         status. (Can be used to add support or further evidence for one’s
         premise.)
    x Frequent use of devices that express real or hypothetical
         conditions or alternatives, e.g. conditional clauses marked by
         ankin ‘if’; positing of hypothetical questions that will support the
         main idea.
    x Frequent use of devices that express reason or logical
         consequences. E.g. conjunction payhokuaw ‘why, because’; the
         adverbial demonstratives sehe, sokwe and seme, to establish
         logical consequence.
    x Frequent use of hortatory statements (let’s …) or value statements
         (this is good/bad).
    Examples (17-20) are consecutive sentences taken from a speech to
encourage better maintenance of the village clinic. The first sentence in
(17) is a value statement about the presence of the Aid Post. This is the
supposition that the speaker will build on.
      (17) Aid Post hromo           yier mon ma kiy-wak

            ‘(The fact) that the Aid Post is in our village is really
            excellent. I am very happy (about that).’
                                                                        395     In (18), the audience is encouraged to rejoice in the presence of the
clinic. The connective seyr ‘and, also’ indicates that, in addition to the
speaker’s contentment with the clinic, the audience should also be pleased
with the clinic as an asset for the village.
       (18) Homkwe seyr               kar     kwa ley.

             2/3PL-TOP and/also gladness HOR go
             ‘You should be happy as well.’
    In (19), the conjunction payhokuaw ‘why, because’ is used to express
reason in support of the theme.
      (19) Payhokuaw,                      Aid Post ohokwe

             ‘Because - this Aid Post is here to help our people and all the
             children with sickness.’
    In (20), a closing hortatory remark is made that includes both speakers
and listeners.
      (20) Hromkwe enkin ohokwe                    Aid Post se

             ‘At this time we should hold on to our Aid Post in a strong
             way.’
    The following string of examples (21-22) are taken from a later part
of the same speech. In (21), the speaker makes use of a hypothetical
question to start a new paragraph.
396       (21) Hai, hwon peik nakwon, hunkwe                perey
            hai hwon peik nak-won hwon-kwe po-rey

            ‘If you are down with some illness, where would you go to?’
    In (22), the speaker makes use of a conditional clause with ankin ‘if’
to support his main theme.

10.1.4 Conclusion in texts
    Most discourse genres conclude with a formulaic closing containing
the adverbial manner demonstrative senkin suffixed by the restrictive
marker -aw.
      Example (23) is the final sentence in the legend “The two brothers”.
                                                                          397      23) Okpey      ok okukwe,                 senkinaw.

          talk-part talk PDEM-GL.F-TOP DDEM-MAN-RSTR
          ‘As for this story, it goes to here (= that is all).’
    Example (24) is the final sentence of a letter.
     (24) Hano ok o, mesopok sohom                        o,
          han-o ok o             me-sopok so-hom          o
          1S-GEN talk and speak-ask DDEM-2/3PL and
          senkinaw.
          so-enkin-aw
          DDEM-MAN-RSTR
          ‘As for my messages and questions, that’s all.’
   Procedural texts may end with the phrase senkinaw as well, or with
some other phrase that will indicate the end of the procedure explained.
Example (25) is the final sentence of a procedural text.
    (25) Owah-mey            somokwe            mey pariawey-ar.
           owah-mey          so-mo-kwe          mey pariawey-ar
           sago.stalk-job DDEM-GL.PL-TOP job last-INTF
           ‘As for this job with the sago stalks, it is the last work.’
    In some cases no formulaic expressions are used, but the speaker
terminates with a fitting ending, e.g. returning to the village, resolution of
a problem, or even advice to the addressee. The speaker links this ending
in some cohesive way to the preceding discourse.
    Example (26) is the last sentence of a non-fiction narrative, when the
two men return home after an unsuccessful fishing trip. The object
demonstrative sehe preceding the verb phrase, anaphorically refers to the
reasons why they came home without food.
     (26) Hohkwe sawk aiai lopa sehe
           hoh-kwe sawk aiai lopa so-h-e
           3DU-TOP CHD food NEG DDEM-3S.M-OBJ

           RPT-go house LOC GL.F-TOP
           ‘So the two of them went back home without food.’
398    Example (27) is the last sentence of the hortatory text about the Aid
Post, which contains important advice to the addressees. The object
demonstrative sehe establishes a logical relationship with the preceding
discourse.
      (27) Hakwe hme              senkin       sehe               me,
           ha-kwe hom-e           so-enkin     so-h-e             me

           hiy-lwayr e
           CAUS-stay OBJ.IMP
           ‘That’s why I am telling you this, so that you should look
           after the Aid Post in a good way.’
    It is also not unusual, especially in hortatory or expository texts, to
add a new supporting argument to the main point in the last sentence of
the text. Example (28-29) is taken from an expository text that deals with
the question: can men send away their wives in a childless marriage? The
author argues against the dismissal of wives. He has several arguments,
but the new supporting argument that women cannot be blamed for
something they were born with is tagged nearly as an afterthought to the
end. The feature of closing the discourse with a new supporting argument
might in some cases be an indication of an ill-prepared speaker. However,
the technique has been observed enough in speeches to consider the
possibility that the speaker may use it as a device to convince his listeners.
By bringing up a new argument in his final sentence, he leaves the listener
with new evidence that supports his view. He thereby gives the impression
that many more arguments in favour of his point of view might have been
brought forward.
     The speaker could have concluded with the hortatory remark in (28).
However, he adds a new argument (29) and makes this the closing remark
of the speech.
                                                                     399     (28) Ha seyr          senkin       nan, uwrsa           homkwe

          ‘And also women without children come like that out of the

     Examples (30-31) come from a speech about the ills of smoking. The
speaker has concluded his reasoning why he does not smoke. He could
have made the final sentence in (30) his closing remark, but in (31) he
adds one more argument (about the inability to play soccer) to convince
the listener.

10.2.1 Narrative discourses
    Legends do not contain formulaic expressions that would set them
apart from other non-fiction narratives, so the comments in this section
hold true for all narratives. The plot in iconically ordered narratives is
composed of a number of episodes, encoded by paragraphs. The
boundaries of episodes are indicated by two or more of the following:
        a. a change (or introduction) of main participants (especially if
            they occur without topic marking);
        b. a change of spatial setting indicated by motion verbs;
        c. a change of temporal setting.
      A narrative can be divided into:
         a. an introduction: the needed background information to
              understand the plot;
         b. a plot: a series of events that describe the build-up, the
              handling and the aftermath of a crisis or challenge;
         c. a conclusion: an evaluative or informative ending to the story.
                                                                          401     Examples (32-34) are part of one text. The first two examples give the
needed background information to understand the plot of the story and the
last example (34) describes the beginning of the crisis. In (32), the first
participant how kamon aiopey ‘a certain big taro’ is introduced with a
topic marker and so is the next participant uwrsa homkwe ‘the people’ in
(33). The next NP how aiopey hay sohokwe ‘that big taro’ is also
topicalised and although it has the semantic role of patient it is not marked
for object. This demonstrates that (32) and (33) contain basically
background information that helps the build-up of events for the plot of
the story. All topic markers are bolded.

    Example (34) does not contain any topicalised constituents and this
signals the sentence as foreground and even climactic. Temporal
references are often topic-marked and therefore the fact that the temporal
reference enekwei kamon ‘a certain day’ has no topic marking indicates
the speaker’s intent to highlight the event described in (34) as foreground.
This is also illustrated by the fact that the agent sa sokruan prueyn hok ‘a
certain young woman’ is introduced as a new participant without topic
marking. (See §8.7.1 on introduction of new participants.)

    The next short story (35-41) displays: (1) an introduction; (2) a plot;
and (3) a conclusion.
    (1) Introduction: Background of the main character Keno is given.
The fact that he never shot a pig is mentioned as necessary background
information. It is marked with the negation marker lopa which
nominalises the clause. (All topic markers are bolded.)

            ‘A long time ago there was a boy in a certain place. His name
            was Keno. He had never shot a pig.’
    (2a) Plot: Build-up to the crisis or challenge. The information given
in the introduction about the main character proves to be a source of
derision that needs to be faced. The main character does not agree with the
opinion of the other villagers about his hunting abilities. These facts
establish the challenge. The storyline is moving from backgrounded
information to foregrounded information. This is displayed in (36) by the
use of direct speech and also by the use of the non-topicalised pronoun ha.
The answer given by the main character is a clause without any
topicalised constituent which is an indicator of foregrounded text.

            one.”’
    (2b) Plot: Handling of the challenge. The clause-initial temporal noun
phrase marked by the numeral enekwei kamon hokwe (a certain day/time)
points towards a new paragraph. It describes the manner in which the
main character handles the challenge before him.
      (37) Enekwei kamon hokwe,              hiykwe             naw-kuw

404    (2c) Plot: Climax of challenge. The fact that the subject hiy is twice
not topicalised is a clear indication that this is foregrounded text. These
lines are part of the climax of the story.

             ‘Not long (after that) Keno went back to see. He said, “OK,
             my sago has been eaten from. I can shoot the pig today.”’
     In (39-40), the plot further develops with the help of the marker
seseyn ‘done accordingly’ which makes the transition from planned action
to executed action. The subject hiy ‘3S.SUB’ is occurs three times in (39-
40) without topicalisation. Twice that is the result of the fact that it is
obligatorily not topicalised because it occurs in a subordinate temporal
clause. The subject hiy ‘3S.SUB’ occurs once (underlined) in the main
clause. In that environment the absence of topicalisation is an indication
that the subject is part of foregrounded text. In (40), the NP uwrsa homkwe
is topicalised, which is an indication that the story line has reached a less
climactic part of the story.

40610.2.2 Procedural texts
    Procedural texts often have an introduction and a conclusion, but they
both can be very short. The ‘plot’ within a procedural text is concerned
with the description of sequenced or logical steps that will enable
someone to correctly perform an action. Procedural texts lack the
emotions, conflict and participant cast of a narrative text, because
procedural texts are in general not concerned with behaviour of people,
but on how particular activities need to be performed. The actor(s) in a
procedural text can be nameless or only be identified according to role.
    Time is normally not indicated in absolute terms, since procedural
texts do not focus on the description of past or current events. The focus is
to give instruction on the right and logical sequence of actions related to a
specific context. Imperfective aspect is widely used in procedural texts.
    Examples (42-50) are taken from the procedural text ‘House building’
(§11.3). The bolded words and phrases are characteristic of how sequence
is marked in procedural texts.
    If a procedural text is produced in written form it might be supplied
with a name. This is often just a non topicalised NP. In (42), the head of
the NP is modified by the embedded clause a meio.
      (42) A        meio yor.
            a       meio yor
            house work way
            ‘The way of house building.’
    In (43), the text starts with an introduction where the author identifies
himself in combination with the theme that he will discuss. As in many
procedural texts, this introduction is very short and in (44), the author
immediately goes ahead to delineate the various steps of house building.
      (43) Hakwe a              meio yor ke           me      sor        ley.
             ha-kwe a           meio yor k-e          me      sor        ley
             1S-TOP house work way 3S.F-OBJ speak count/tell go
             ‘I am going to tell about the way to make a house.’
    The agent of the next sentence is hunkwe ‘you’. The singular second
personal pronoun stands here for any, not further defined, person who
wants to undertake the task of house building.
                                                                       407     (44) Hunkwe      a       meio ankin, hunkwe

          ‘When you build a house, this is how you start out.’
    The agent in procedural texts only needs to be mentioned once. After
that the agent does not need to be mentioned, except when the author
wants to draw special attention to the agent. But an agent is obligatorily
absent in a clause that follows a clause marked by nok ‘SEQ’.
     In (45), hunkwe ‘you’ is the assumed agent, but does not need to be
mentioned. As can be seen from the rest of the examples, the agent
hunkwe is elided in all the examples following. The temporal adverb peyr
‘firstly’ and the adverbial constituent koruay ‘in preparation for’ help to
place the various activities in the right sequence.
       (45) Peyr nop-i                  me      kwa lowk hnar
              peyr nop-i                m-e     kwa lowk hnar

             ‘First you go out and you cut and split the ironwood posts in
             preparation (for the building).’
    The sentence-initial marker hai ‘O.K.’ makes a clear break between
the previous event and the one about to be mentioned. The one event is
assumed to be finished before the next event starts. The sequential marker
nok and a second use of koruay assist in establishing the sequence order.

            vertical and horizontal roof beams, and all the wall post
            connectors and then you cut all the vines.’
      The verbal modifier lowpway expresses the completion of an action.
       (47) Omeme somokwe                  yier mon-aw kekie
             omeme so-mo-kwe               yier mon-aw kekie

    The postpositional phrase marked by the locative mon indicates time
sequence here. Also the verbal modifier pie helps to establish the
sequential order of the events.

    In (49), the right order of the events is established with the help of the
sequential marker nok and the final sequence-marker ok.

             ‘After having done that, dig holes and then finish (the job) of
             placing all of the ironwood trees.’
     In (50), the first sentence is a temporal construction with senkinaw,
marking a limited time span (§9.4.8). The NP mey pariawey-ar ‘very last
work’ forms the end and the conclusion of the procedural text. The abrupt
ending is not unusual within a procedural text, since there is often no need
for evaluative comments once the description of the procedure is finished.

41010.2.3 Descriptive texts
     Descriptive texts are similar to procedural texts in that they are
informative and non-emotive. Procedural and descriptive texts both make
extensive use of the imperfective, since these texts often prescribe or
describe general or habitual behaviour. This is in contrast with narrative
texts which make extensive use of the perfective to describe unique events
that in their totality took place in the past.
    Whereas procedural texts are concerned with the correct manner to
perform a task, descriptive texts are concerned with the description of
observed behaviour or characteristics. Descriptive texts centre around a
global theme that is often a directly observable entity (e.g. animal, place,
custom, activity).
     Descriptive texts make frequent use of verbless clauses: a topicalised
entity is supplied with a comment that either gives additional information
to that entity or supplies the entity with a certain identity. In (51), the first
topic NP is further defined for attributive characteristics, the second topic
NP is further identified for role.
      (51) Topic                   Comment Topic          Comment

              ‘That man is big/tall. He is a teacher.’
   Descriptions of customary activities often feature the habitual modal
marker seyn as illustrated in (52).

           ‘They are not in the habit of attacking people.’
    Descriptive texts tend to have very few non-topicalised NPs that are
syntactically marked for subject or object. This in contrast to narrative
texts where non-topicalised NPs occur frequently. In (53-60), there is no
occurrence of a non-topicalised subject and only one example of a non-
topicalised object.
    Descriptive texts are also characterised by a high number of verbless
clauses or clauses formed with the stative verb lwak like e.g. (53) and
                                                                           411(54). The two topicalised NPs marked by mokwe occur in clauses that are
formed with the stative verb lwak. (Below in (53-60), all topic markers are
bolded.)
      (53) Wondeis mo           owh mokwe          ma me

            ‘Their bodies are very soft.’
    Non-topicalised NPs with syntactic marking are relatively rare in
descriptive texts. That is especially true for non-topicalised NPs marked
for subject and to a lesser extent for non-topicalised NPs marked for
object. The NP iwar me ‘people, human beings’ in (52) is an example of
such an occurrence.
    The bolded NPs in (55) and (56) are respectively marked for object
and subject, but are topicalised as well.
     (55) Hmekwe               iha nonaw          liy nekie wây.
             hom-e-kwe         iha   non-aw       liy nekie lway

             man-woman 2/3PL.SUB-TOP habitually eat.IPFTV
            ‘People are in the habit of eating (them).’
     Participants and props that are referred to in a descriptive text often do
not represent an individual, unique entity. This in contrast to narrative
texts, where participants and props have their own identity and often play
roles in specific, unique events. Many of the entities referred to in a
descriptive text are not uniquely identifiable entities, but often function as
representatives for their type or category. The marking on the NPs reflects
this. In (57), hmo pion mokwe ‘their meat’ has patient role, but it is not
412marked for object. It is only marked by the general topic marker mokwe.
This is in line with the fact that the NP does not represent a single
identifiable entity, but represents the meat of all other wondeis-snakes as
well.
      (57) Hmo             pion mokwe          won     non nuw-â.

             ‘As for their meat, it is eaten with grease (= tastes really
             good).’
   In (58-60), the subject homkwe occurs three times topicalised. No
non-topicalised NPs that are syntactically marked occur in these sentences.
     (58) Homkwe              now mon hoaho

    Descriptive texts can contain instructive sections that look very
similar to sections of a procedural text, e.g. the text “The snake” (§11.4)
moves from descriptive to instructive in the second part of the text. When
a descriptive text becomes instructive, an addressee is needed. Below, the
                                                                          413addressee is referred to by hwon ‘2S.SUB’ which functions as a universal
‘you’ taking into its scope all who hear or read this text.
    In (61-63), possible scenarios are given in subordinate clauses marked
by ankin ‘if’ which are followed by a main clause expressing a command.
In (61), the command is marked by the prohibitive marker pese, and in
(63), the command is marked by the hortative marker kwa.

10.2.4 Hortatory and expository discourses
    Hortatory discourse resembles expository discourse in that they are
both organised thematically and contain sentences that do not encode
events and are not ordered iconically. Both types of discourse want to
414inform, defend a particular course of action, or express the speaker’s
viewpoint. The focus of an expository discourse is directed towards
building a sound argument, while the focus of a hortatory discourse is to
modify the addressee’s thinking or behaviour. Therefore, one will find
that a hortatory discourse is often punctuated at various intervals by value-
judgements, commands or suggestions using hortative forms and
assertions. An expository text deals with arguments and counter
arguments and the author can give a conclusion with or without
exhortation. For example, in the text on problems in childless marriages
(§11.5), the author only states his disapproval of men sending their wives
away in the final paragraph, after he has delineated arguments in favour
and against this behaviour.
    Expository discourse deals with reasons, goals, contrasts,
comparisons, conditions linked to consequences, etc. The expression of
complicated ideas leads to the use of complex sentences with subordinate
clauses. An individual clause might be complex as well when e.g. a noun
is modified by embedded phrases or clauses, or when a subordinate clause
is placed in tail position when the speaker fears that the sentence might
not be fully understood.
     In (64), the sentence contains a NP modified by a relative clause. It
also has an object clause in tail position. The modified NP is embedded at
two levels. The head of the NP uwr ‘man’ is marked for number by the
phrase final plural demonstrative somokwe. The NP head uwr is modified
by an embedded NP of which the head is sa ‘woman’. This head is
modified by the embedded relative clause ney lopa ma lwak. The
demonstrative seme that precedes the verb phrase establishes a logical
relationship between this clause and the previous one. The object clause in
tail position gives more detail to the idea expressed in the main clause.

            ‘As a result the men whose wives do not have children are
            coming up with different ideas to send their wives away.’
    Apart from the fact that the hortatory and the expository text differ in
focus, the discourse types have many similar features. Cohesive
connectives like seyr and sawk (§9.1) which are relatively rare in
descriptive and procedural texts often link or contrast arguments that
support the speaker’s main contentions. Conjunctions encoding reason
(payhokuaw §9.3.3), condition/circumstances (ankin §9.5.3), or logical
consequence (sehe, sokwe, seme §4.4.3) are used often.
    In (65), the speaker makes use of reason and conditonal conjunctions
and links his argment to (66) by means of the contrastive connective sawk.
The speaker contrasts the group of men with children and the group of
men without children. All the conjunctions and cohesive markers in (65-
68) are bolded.

           ‘But those without children experience hardships, when they
           have become old men.’
    Subordinate clauses normally precede the main clause, but in (66) the
temporal clause is placed in tail position. As stated before, the tail position
is not used for new information. The speaker simply wants to avoid
ambiguity and adds the subordinate clause to make explicit what could
have been understood from the context already.
    Quotes are introduced by the adverbial manner demonstrative senkin
(§4.4.2). The two consecutive arguments in (67-68) are linked by the
cohesive marker seyr ‘and, also’. The marker seyr links entities that are
similar to each other (§9.1.3). In this case it links two quotes that argue in
favour of the same point.

    A hortatory text is marked by frequent exhortations. The examples
below are taken from a speech by the local government member exhorting
the people to show up for the village work party the next Monday (§11.6).
The arguments used are a combination of veiled threats and appeals to
parental concern for the well-being of their children. The speaker portrays
himself both as the village leader they need to obey and as the concerned
father figure who looks after everyone’s well-being.
    His discourse expresses three times a general command to look well
after the Aid Post. This can be done by an adhortative command (§7.1)
with the clause-final goal marker e as is done in (69).

418     The speaker’s arguments are also made forceful by rhetorical
questions that underline his arguments. Example (70) is a question which,
though answered, is rhetorical in nature. It emphasises the fact that no
alternatives for medical help are available. In (71), the speaker emphasises
this point by listing the potential difficulties the people are likely to
encounter if no action is taken.

     It is very rare that the main point of a public hortatory speech is made
in the opening lines and then followed by supporting evidence. A speaker
prefers to pave the way for his main point by mentioning supporting
                                                                    419reasons and arguments first. He anticipates potential resistance to his
opinion or proposal and tries to answer these objections before he comes
to his main point.
    The local parliament member in his speech about the Aid Post had as
goal to make the village people show up for community work on Monday.
This point is only made towards the end of the speech (73), after the
benefits of having the Aid Post have been mentioned and negative
scenarios of the village without an Aid Post have been stressed. Even
then, the speaker stays away from a direct command, but rather describes
what should happen when he asks the people to work on the Aid Post.

10.2.5 Personal letters
    Personal letters have several features which distinguish them from
other thematically organised texts. They have five components:
        a. name of the addressee;
        b. introductory greetings;
        c. stage setting or introduction to the main point;
        d. main point or request;
        e. closing, which has the writer’s signature.
420     a. The name of the addressee is preferably another name than the
officially given name. The addressee may be referred to by a nickname,
e.g. hiymei hay ‘the very tall one’ or a kinship term.
     b. The introductory greetings include a statement about the author’s
wellbeing and may include an enquiry about the addressee’s health,
although the latter is not always needed as can be seen in §11.7. These
introductory greetings are rarely skipped, not even in letters expressing
anger. Like all discourse introductions, these greetings are heavily topic-
marked.
     c. The author sets the stage for introducing his main point or request
first. This argumentation can either remove obstacles that hinder this main
point or request or state certain facts that buttress it, e.g. (74-75).
    d. The main point or request may be made less direct by introductory
sentences that talk about the request but do not explicitly state it yet (76).
    e. The conclusion consists of final greetings that focus primarily on
the addressee and his or her family. The formulaic closing often includes
senkinaw ‘that’s all’.
     The letter in §11.7 contains a request to be allowed to work on a
building project. The author is an elementary teacher who has left his
work. The teacher removes the possible objection that he cannot be hired
for the building project, since he has left his responsibilities as a teacher.
He stresses the fact of his availability by explaining further why he is not
likely to return to his teaching role. In examples (74) and (74), he also
rules out the possibility of an offer to teach in a different village, by
stating that he is not really interested in being a teacher.
      (74) Hunkwe           hano      ok, paraw ha ma me,

          ‘I said that as for continually being an elementary teacher, I
          was not really interested (lit. I was not with very important
          heart/thoughts).’
     The main point, or main request of a letter is rarely placed in the
beginning of the letter. The actual request in the letter in §11.7 is made
towards the end of the letter, after the author has already elaborated on the
fact that he is fully available for the job he is requesting. The author wants
to make himself agreeable and non-controversial. The use of the non-
contrastive seyr is also a helpful device in that respect.
     The final request is not stated abruptly, but is introduced with a short
introductory sentence that leads up to the question as is illustrated in (76).
      (76) Hakwe hnekwe               seyr       mesopok kamon
             ha-kwe hwon-e-kwe seyr              me-sopok kamon

             DDEM-MAN speak-ask go
             ‘I am going to ask you a question.’
    This introduction sentence is followed by two very different,
unrelated requests (§11.7). The first request (to become enrolled in
medical training) is immediately followed by the second request to be
made part of the building crew for an upcoming building project. This last
request was in all likelihood the reason why the letter was written (see
§11.7 for last part of letter).
         Appendices: Abau texts
11.1 Narrative (Legend)
    The text of “The two brothers” has been analysed in reference to the
three positions in the Abau sentence structure: topic part (P1 and P2),
comment part (identified by the absence of topic marking) and tail (P3).
    The last NP of the topic part of the sentence is always the P1
constituent and is by definition the most prominent constituent of the topic
part. All NPs preceding this P1 constituent are P2 constituents. The
comment part is marked by non-topicalised constituents like OBJ, SUB, PP,
ADVP, VP, PP and the comment part of a verbless clauses is simply marked
comment.) The tail is marked by a P3 constituent which is often
topicalised, but not obligatorily. The meaning of the labels used are
explained in the table below.

"1.7 Typological overview of Abau
    Abau has nominative-accusative orientation in both its syntax and its
case marking. Default ordering of arguments is Subject Object Verb
(SOV). This ordering frequently varies for pragmatic reasons. Topic is
overtly marked on noun phrases, and is clearly distinguished from subject.
The presence or absence of topic marking on NPs divides every
predication into a left-located topic-marked component and a right-located
comment.
                                                                                         9     Abau appears to be an extreme example of the tendency to
“thematisation” described by de Vries (2005: 368). He notes that in a
number of Papuan languages thematic constituents are “a juxtaposed
series of thematic constituents that have pragmatic relations of relevance
to the clauses that follow but are syntactically and intonationally separate
units.” This pattern occurs often in Abau. However, whereas in many
Papuan languages this pattern is associated with the beginning of a text
and the number of noun phrases per verb declines drastically once the
story is under way (de Vries 2005: 369), in Abau topic-marked noun
phrases remain frequent throughout entire texts.
     In the typology of head-marking and dependent-marking languages
introduced by Nichols (1986), Abau is an extreme example of a
dependent-marking grammar.2 Examples of this tendency are:
     a. The high proportion of nouns to verbs already described.
     b. A complex system of dependent noun phrase markers which
         follow almost every noun, and establish its pragmatic, syntactic
         and semantic role.
     c. The existence of both a gender system (marked on the noun
         phrase markers), and a cross-cutting system of numeral classifiers,
         used with the numerals one, two and three.
     d. Verbs do not inflect for tense, aspect, mood or person. Verb stems
         are affixed only for direction and manner of action. The
         distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect is
         indicated by clause-final particles in the case of non-indicative
         clauses, and by intonation over the verb phrase for indicative
         clauses.","[22, 23]"
"3.6 Pragmatic NP markers with and without
demonstrative force
    The next four sections will deal with all the NP final markers. They are
presented in order.
    Section §3.6 deals with all the NP markers that occur NP finally which
are marked pragmatically but not syntactically. Table 23 gives an
overview of all possible non-syntactic pragmatic NP markers with and
without demonstrative force.
    Sections §3.7 and §3.8 deal with all the NP markers that give the NP
syntactic function. For a summary overview of all syntactic NP markers
including syntactic demonstrative markers, see Table 28.
    Section §3.9 deals with the markers for postpositional phrases. An
overview of all postpositions is found in Table 29.
76    The rest of section §3.6 deals with NP markers that are not marked
syntactically but only pragmatically for topic.
3.6.1 Non-syntactic, pragmatic NP markers without
demonstrative force
    Topic or givenness (defined in §8.1) in Abau is marked by -kwe and
refers to all information that the speaker assumes is present or readily
accessible in the addressee’s consciousness. A more extensive discussion
on the concept of topic is found in §8.1. Noun phrases are marked for
pragmatic function only by the topic marker -kwe which is attached to a
bound morpheme that carries information on the number and/or gender of
the head of the NP. These markers are listed in Table 22.

treated as background information and occur in the beginning of the
sentence.
    In (78) and (79), the initial NPs are only marked for pragmatic role.
The NP is the topic the speaker wants to comment on. In (78), the bolded
NP is not syntactically marked for object, although the NP has patient role
within the clause. In (79), the bolded NP has agent role, but is not marked
syntactically for subject.

3.6.2 Non-syntactic, pragmatic NP markers with
demonstrative force
     Non-syntactic, pragmatic NP markers can be given demonstrative
force when prefixed by the proximal demonstrative marker o- or by the
distal demonstrative marker so-. Demonstrative topic markers behave like
general topic markers in that they occur noun phrase finally, always host
the topic suffix -kwe, and only assign a pragmatic role to the NP. Table 22
has been extended into Table 23 to contain all the non-syntactic NP
markers.
          TABLE 23: NON-SYNTACTIC TOPIC MARKERS AND NON-SYNTACTIC

   A count of general demonstrative topic markers in 5,500 sentences
showed that out of every 10 demonstrative topic markers, less than one is
marked by the proximal prefix o-. The proximal demonstrative topic
marker is used in the following contexts:
   a. the entity referred to is being held or can be touched;
   b. the entity referred to is a temporal which relates to present time.
6
    Kokwe might have been kukwe in the past, which would explain the feminine forms
    okukwe and sokukwe in this table.
78     In (80), the demonstrative topic marker ohokwe is used to refer to a
proximal entity, contrasting with somokwe, which refers to a more distant
entity:
       (80) Youk     ohokwe              hano, sawk youk
             youk    o-ho-kwe            han-o sawk youk

             DDEM-GL.PL-TOP 1S-GEN NEG
             ‘This paddle is mine, but those paddles are not mine.’
    The distinction between o- and so- is used extensively to contrast the
present time with the past. In (81) ohokwe combined with enkin (which
can be deleted without affecting the basic meaning) indicates the present
time, while sohokwe is used in (82) to indicate a particular time in the
past.

location and time than their counterparts, the proximal demonstrative
topic markers. The former is more frequently used anaphorically to keep
track of already introduced participants within a story. This is illustrated
in (83) where a snake is introduced in the first sentence and further
information is given in the second. As can be seen from (83), the Abau
demonstrative sohokwe overlaps with the use of the English definite
article the.
      (83) Sa          sok    hiy         lousne. Sok
             sa        sok    hiy         lousne sok

             ‘Then a snake appeared. The snake was very big.’
     When the general topic marker occurs with a demonstrative prefix, it
is also only marked for pragmatic role and not for syntactic role or
semantic role as can be seen from example (84) and (85). The bolded NP
fills the role of agent in (84) and the role of patient in (85), but in both
cases the NP is not syntactically marked.
       (84) Huok sohokwe,                  hano     aio  se          peyk.

              ‘As for that pig, my father shot it.’
    All pragmatic markers within this section are per definition
topicalised. The important role of these non-syntactic topic markers in
verbless clauses is discussed in §6.2. The importance of the dichotomy
between topicalised NPs and non-topicalised NPs is further explained in
§8, as well as the importance of the presence or absence of topicalised
NP-final markers in foregrounded or background text (see §8.6 and §8.8).

3.7 Syntactically marked NPs without
demonstrative force
    Noun phrases can be marked syntactically for subject, object and
genitive. These NP markers are differentiated for number and/or gender.
The subject and object marker can be topicalised, but not the genitive.
       TABLE 24: SYNTACTIC NP MARKERS WITH AND WITHOUT TOPIC MARKING                                            Syntactic NP marker

             Genitive – PL                  mo
    A noun phrase is marked for subject by means of a noun phrase final
marker which is identical in form to the third person personal pronoun
subject (§3.1.1). When the NP is topicalised the topic marker -kwe is
suffixed to the pronoun.
     There are three object NP markers without demonstrative force and
they are not based on the personal pronoun set. The object NP marker
itself cannot host a topic marker, but can be followed by a topic marker.
7
    hok ‘3S.F.SUB’ suffixed by -kwe ‘TOP’ is written as hokwe, but the underlying form is
    /hok-kwe/. The final k in hok is deleted when suffixed by the topic marker -kwe.
                                                                         81    The genitive cannot be topicalised. A noun phrase is marked for
genitive by a member of a closed set of three members. The genitive
marker relates the NP it marks to the NP it precedes. (See also §3.10.1.1
and §3.8.3.)
3.7.1 Subject NP marker
    In (86), the NP final marker hoh ‘the two of them’ gives subject
function to the NP. It agrees in person and number with the head of the NP
sa ‘woman’.
      (86) Sa          hoh        non-ira me,    “Okar.”
             sa        hoh        non-lira me    ok-ar
             woman 3DU.SUB DU-see speak talk-INTF
             ‘The two women looked and said, “True.”’
    The same set of subject markers marks animate and inanimate actors
as can be seen in (87) where howniy ‘wind’ is marked for subject.
      (87) Hyo           a       sohokwe           howniy hok
            hiy-o       a        so-ho-kwe         howniy hok

            blow break move.PL BEN
            ‘As for his house, the wind blew it down destroying it.’
3.7.2 Topicalisation of the subject NP marker
    In (88), the NP marker hokwe ‘she’ occurs NP finally and consists of
the subject marker hok and the topic marker -kwe. The NP marker agrees
in number and gender with the head of the NP, the proper name Yamayo.
      (88) Yamayo hokwe               ney se            po liwak.
             Yamayo hok-kwe           ney s-e           po liwak
             Yamayo 3S.F.SUB-TOP child 3S.M-OBJ PFT sit/deliver
             ‘Yamayo has delivered a child.’
    In (89), the noun phrase marker hiy is suffixed by the topic marker
-kwe and marks the NP for topic and subject. It is noteworthy and
characteristic that all topicalised NPs occur in the beginning of the clause
and all NPs that are not marked for topic precede the VP.
82     (89) Hakwe         sok      se         hok, sawk hano

          1S-OBJ shoot BEN
          ‘I was afraid of the snake, but my older brother killed that
          snake for me.’
3.7.3 Object NP markers without demonstrative force
    Abau has three object NP markers without demonstrative force (se, ke
and me), and six object NP markers which have it (the latter group is
discussed in §3.8.2). All object NP markers display a final -e which signals
object. They are all differentiated for gender and/or number. They mark
the NP as a referential item or identifiable participant.
   In (90), the NP yeyk se is marked for object by the NP marker se. This
marker also marks the noun for masculine singular. The NP aio hiykwe is
marked for subject and topic by the NP marker hiykwe.
     (90) Aio       hiykwe          yeyk se            meio.
            aio     hiy-kwe         yeyk s-e           meio
            father 3S.M.SUB-TOP canoe 3S.M-OBJ work
            ‘Father makes a canoe.’
   The use of the masculine object marker is also illustrated in (91). The
marked NP refers to an identifiable referent.
     (91) Sawk uwr prueyn se                  now hiy
           sawk uwr prueyn s-e                now hiy

           ‘And a tree fell and broke over a certain man.’

knife’.
      (92) Kenu hiykwe              hyo         pisu ke
             Kenu hiy-kwe           hiy-o       pisu k-e

             take.one SEQ go
             ‘Kenu took his bush knife and then he went.’
3.7.4 Topicalisation of object NPs
    The topicalisation of object NPs is not straightforward. The
topicalisation of object pronouns (§3.1.3) is slightly different from the
topicalisation that occurs on object NP markers. NPs marked for object that
have a noun as head of the NP are topicalised by the feminine topic marker
kokwe regardless of gender and number.
    In (93), the bolded NP Keno se kokwe is marked syntactically for
object and pragmatically for topic. The gender and number of the head
noun is marked by the singular masculine object marker se and not by the
NP final topic marker kokwe which has feminine gender. The topic marker
kokwe takes into its scope the noun with its object marking.
      (93) Keno se              kokwe      ur    hiy
             Keno s-e           ko-kwe ur        hiy
             Keno 3S.M-OBJ GL.F-TOP vine 3S.M.SUB
             way-a-way           kuayk nayr.
             lway-a-lway         kuayk nayr
             tangle-DUP-tangle fall      night
             ‘As for Keno, a vine tangled around causing him to fall in the
             night.’
    In (94), the NP Kupe se kokwe is both topicalised and marked for
object. This double marking is in this example required, since the normal
syntax order SOV is changed to OSV. (For more discussion see §6.5.1.)
84     (94) Enekwei sohokwe               Kupe se            kokwe
          enekwei so-ho-kwe             Kupe s-e           ko-kwe

          police one.CL1 3S.M.SUB call
          ‘As for that time, regarding Kupe, a certain policeman took
          him along.’
    In (95), the object kuey me ‘grubs PL-OBJ’ is topicalised by the topic
marker kokwe. Again, the head of the noun phrase is marked for number
by the object marker me and not by the feminine singular topic marker
kokwe.
      (95) Kuey me           kokwe      hano      sa      ko           orih
             kuey m-e        ko-kwe han-o sa              k-o          orih

             3S.M.SUB cut       Lapwan river.mouth LOC
             ‘As for the grubs, my wife’s father cut them out (of the tree)
             at the Lapwan’s river mouth.’
    Forms like se-kwe in (96) have been observed in some oral texts, but
are not accepted by all.
      (96) *Uwr se-kwe              hakwe lira pa.
            man 3S.M.OBJ-TOP 1S-TOP see NEG.PFTV
            ‘As for the man, I did not see him.’
    The use of sekwe and even sokwe as a contraction of se kokwe has
been especially observed in the central dialect. This usage is considered
incorrect by other dialects since the usage of sekwe and sokwe, is similar
or identical to the distal demonstrative object marker sokwe (§3.8.2).
When editing texts, even speakers of the central dialect tend to change
sekwe to se kokwe. Similar contractions of ke kokwe and me kokwe into
shorter forms have not been observed.
3.7.5 Genitive NP markers
    There are only three genitive NP markers (so, ko and mo) which occur
NP finally in an embedded NP that modifies the main NP.
                                                                      85    In (97), the two bolded NPs are marked by the genitive markers mo
and so. These markers also convey information about the gender and/or
number of the NPs they follow. The bolded NPs are embedded within a NP.
They both modify the NP they precede. (See also §3.10.1.1.)
      (97) Ney mo             tisa     hiykwe          senkin        me,

            ‘The children’s teacher said, “The school’s roof cap contains
            holes.”’3.8    Syntactic demonstrative NP markers
    Syntactic demonstrative NP markers identify subject and object and
differentiate proximal and distal markers. The syntactic demonstrative NP
marker can be used in genitive constructions but there is no separate
genitive demonstrative NP marker.
3.8.1 Subject demonstrative NP marker
    As was shown in §0, a NP can be marked as subject by the NP subject
markers hiy, hok, hoh and hom. The NP subject markers can also be given
demonstrative force as is shown in Table 25. The basic forms of the
subject demonstrative NP markers are similar to the subject pronoun NP
markers dealt with in §0, differing only in the addition of the distal or
proximal demonstrative prefix so- or o-.
               TABLE 25: SUBJECT DEMONSTRATIVE MARKERS                            Proximal          Distal

         Subject – PL       o-hom             s-o-hom
86     It is important to note that subject demonstratives can never occur
with the topic marker -kwe. Also, in contrast to the subject pronoun NP
markers, subject demonstrative NP markers cannot function by themselves
as the head of the NP.
    The subject demonstrative is used when the entity it marks has agent
role and needs to be distinguished from other known alternatives.
    In (98), sohok ‘DDEM-3S.F’ tags the bolded NP as the subject of its
clause.
      (98) Hok yeyk mon nak-kair                   kwawk        liok,     sawk
            hok yeyk mon nak-kair                  kwawk        liok      sawk

            ‘She tried in vain to lift up (the turtle) and put it in the canoe,
            but that (specific) turtle ran away.’
   In (99), the second bolded NP is marked by the demonstrative subject
marker sohom. The first bolded NP is not marked by a syntactic
demonstrative NP marker, but by a demonstrative NP marker (sokukwe)
which only signals its pragmatic function.
     (99) Woyo-hne sokukwe                 sawk uwr sohom

3.8.2 Object demonstrative markers
    All NP object markers belong to an exhaustive set consisting of nine
members and are characterised by a final morpheme -e ‘object’. The three
object NP markers dealt with in §3.7.3 can be combined with the
demonstrative markers so- and o-. These six demonstrative object markers
are affected by vowel harmony rules which are dealt with in section
§2.6.2. The underlying forms of the six object demonstrative markers are

    The NP object demonstrative cannot host the topic marker -kwe. A NP
containing an object demonstrative is topicalised by the feminine topic
marker kokwe regardless of the number and gender of the head noun. This8
  The masculine form here is represented by -he and not by -se, as one would expect from
  looking at the definite object marker column in the table. No explanation for this change
  has been found.

  The underlying form of okwe is /o-ke/ and that of sokwe is /so-ke/.The insertion of the w
  is puzzling as this morphophonemic change does not have a comparable counterpart
  elsewhere.
88use of the feminine topic marker is also observed in NPs marked for
semantic case. (Compare Table 29.)
    In (101), the plural demonstrative object marker seme is used in the
bolded NP.

    In (103), the feminine demonstrative object marker is used in the NP
pruam sokwe. The masculine demonstrative object marker sehe that
precedes the verb phrase is not part of a NP. It occurs by itself and is used
to express a causative relationship. The use of these causal demonstratives
preceding the verb phrase is discussed in §4.4.3.
     (103) Hiy pruam            sokwe              ma nwaksu hokwe,

   In (104), the bolded NP is marked by the demonstrative object marker
sokwe which is suffixed by the restrictive marker -aw
    (104) Hiykwe           mowkwar sokwe-aw                lway nok.

3.8.3 The use of the genitive in NPs marked by a
syntactic demonstrative
    Genitive markers (so, ko and mo) are always embedded within a main
NP. Genitive markers themselves cannot be affixed by the demonstrative
markers o- and so-, but they can occur in NP constructions that contain a
demonstrative NP marker. The genitive marker follows the marker that has
demonstrative force (e.g. sohiy so, sohok ko, sohom mo).
     It is interesting that the subject demonstrative marker is used in these
genitive constructions. The subject demonstrative marker loses its subject
function since the function of the NP is determined by the final NP marker.
The phenomenon that the subject marker loses its subject force when
followed by another NP marker is also observed when the subject marker
is followed by a postposition (§3.9.9).
              TABLE 27: GENITIVE CONSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING A

90    In (105), the subject demonstrative sohiy is followed by the masculine
genitive marker so. The genitive construction yier sohiy so modifies as a
pre-head genitive constituent the head of the main NP uru ‘name’. This
main NP is marked by the masculine topic marker hokwe which agrees in
number and gender with the head of the NP, uru ‘name’.
    (105) [Yier sohiy                so]         uru hokwe        Vanimo.

            ‘The name of that place was Vanimo.’
   In (106), the subject demonstrative sohok is followed by the genitive
marker ko. The bolded genitive construction modifies the head of the NP
weynpaweyn ‘behaviour’. This NP is marked by the feminine object
marker ke which agrees in number and gender with the head of the NP.
   (106) Hiykwe        [sa     sohok        ko]         weynpaweyn

3.8.4 Overview of all syntactic NP markers
    All the information on syntactic NP markers given in §3.7 and §3.8 is
brought together in Table 25. The table gives an overview of all syntactic
NP markers and how they are topicalised (by -kwe or kokwe). It is
noteworthy that demonstratives marked for subject, object or genitive are
never topicalised.
     The three distal object demonstrative markers (sehe, sokwe and seme)
and the distal manner marker (senkin) are not only used adjectivally but
also adverbially. When used adverbially these demonstratives
immediately precede the verb phrase as an adverbial phrase that consists
of only one member. The adverbially used demonstrative encodes a
relationship of logical consequence between the clause it occurs in, and
the clause or sentence it anaphorically refers to (§4.4.2 and §4.4.3).

postpositional phrases
       NPs encoding semantic roles in the clause other than agent and patient
are structurally postpositional phrases. In this section the different
structural shapes of these NPs are discussed.
    a) +NP +Postposition
        NPs that occur in this category are:
        1. Locative NP              NP + mon
        2. Exactness NP             NP + sok

    In Table 29, the semantic NP markers are listed as another clearly
marked category. All noun phrases marked for semantic function can also
be topicalised by a phrase final topic marker.

structures postpositional phrases. The animate accompaniment and the
comparative have an object marked NP that does not function as the object
of the clause but as the object of the postposition. Syntactically, the
animate accompaniment and comparative phrases are postpositional
phrases. However, for the sake of symmetry and economy in presentation,
I will call them NPs marked by postpositions which indicate semantic case
                                                                        93role. The intonation pattern supports this approach, as there is no pause
after the object marker in the Accompaniment NP and the Comparative NP.
3.9.1 Locative
     Locative NPs are marked by the postposition mon ‘LOC’. The locative
postposition itself does not carry any additional information about exact
position or movement. This information is mostly carried by the verb or
by location nouns that precede the locative marker mon. In (107), the
locative marker mon can be used with a motion verb and also with a
stative verb.
     (107) Aio        hiykwe           sapa mon ley.
              aio     hiy-kwe          sapa mon ley

              mother 3S.F.SUB-TOP house LOC be
              ‘Father went to the forest. Mother is in the house.’
    Location can be further specified by a set of location nouns, which are
placed after the noun or compound noun they specify for location. This is
done in two ways. Either the location noun is juxtaposed with the head
noun as in (108) where eir ‘top’ follows now-mowr. Alternatively a
genitive construction may be used, as in (109) where ohri ‘close’ follows
the genitive construction uwr mo.
     (108) Ey hiykwe               now-mowr eir mon liawon.

94    The following nouns in conjunction with mon specify a positional
location:

            ayaw     ‘high’            ouon      ‘under, inside’

            ‘When children are big they climb high in trees.’
    Mon normally encodes location in space. But it can also encode
location in time, particularly in conjunction with meyki ‘behind, after’
(113).
    (113) Kaunsil       so          meyki mon posokwaw

            shoot Q.SP.PFTV.M
            ‘Who shot after the councillor (did)?’
    The positional noun meyki ‘behind, after’ also refers to location in
space, as in (114).
                                                                          95    (114) Hiykwe      hyo         meyki mon sau ney nok,

          3S.M-OBJ hit       fall
          ‘He ran after him and then tripped him.’
     When the noun specified for location has the feature [+ human], there
is a strong preference to use the genitive to form the locative construction,
as (115) illustrates.

   However, (116) demonstrates that location nouns that modify human
nouns do not always need to be preceded by a genitive marker.

    The location words are analysed as nouns on the basis of distribution.
In (117), ompok is preceded by a genitive marker and followed by an
objective marker, which is a position that can only be filled by nouns.

3.9.2 Exactness
    The postposition sok marks both temporal and locative phrases for
exactness, i.e. exact location in space or time. In (118), sok marks exact
time.

has been observed in texts with ompok ‘middle’, eir ‘top’, ohri ‘close’ and
meyki ‘behind, after (when referring to time)’.

   Comitative NPs are marked by the postposition non. The marker non
‘comitative’ has a number of uses:
        1. Relational (120-122)
        2. Instrumental (123-124)
        3. Inanimate Accompaniment (125-126)
    1. The comitative relates a noun phrase in the predication as a
component or a possession of another NP in that predication as in (120)
and (121).
    (120) Mu          homkwe        orow non.
           mu         hom-kwe orow non

           3S.M-TOP illness bad           CMT
           ‘He has a bad illness.’
     The comitative non can also be used in an embedded construction. It
relates the embedded NP marked by the comitative to the head of the NP.
     In (122), the modifying NP owk non ‘with string bag’ relates this
entity as being associated to the head of the noun phrase it modifies, i.e.
yoh ‘banana’. The two entities coexist together forming a new entity as it
were.
     (122) Yoh         owk        non sokukwe               sa
             Yoh       owk        non so-ko-kwe             sa

             ‘As for these bananas with/in the string bag, the woman did
             not bring them.’
    2. It encodes instrument when the NP immediately precedes a
transitive verb phrase. In that position it will follow the object NP, as in
(123). As previously stated, phrases that occur between a non-topic-
98marked object NP and the verb phrase are unusual and noteworthy. When
such a phrase is marked by non, it always encodes instrument.
    (123) Hiykwe            hyo         a      se         yia non
            hiy-kwe         hiy-o       a      s-e        yia non

            burn put.inside BEN
            ‘He burned his house with fire.’
    Example (124) illustrates the same point. The NP marked by the
comitative non is instrumental in force, as it follows the non-topic-marked
object NP ney prueyn se.
    (124) Pouh        hokwe          sawk ney prueyn se
            pouh      hok-kwe        sawk ney prueyn s-e

            axe CMT beat hold-break head                 EXCT
            ‘Mother cracked one child with an axe right on the head.’
    3. Non-human accompaniment is marked by the comitative marker
non, as example (125) and (126) show. Both NPs immediately precede a
motion verb and therefore the NPs do not express instrument, but rather
non-human accompaniment. (Human accompaniment is dealt with in the
next section.)
    (125) Hakwe         ki         ley ankin,       ompow non

          dog and shot them.’
3.9.3.1 Postpositional comitative noun phrase embedded
within another noun phrase
    The comitative can be used to embed a postpositional noun phrase
within another noun phrase. The embedded noun phrase follows and
modifies the head of the noun phrase and is followed by the noun phrase
final marker. In the examples below the head of the NP and the NP final
marker are bolded; the embedded noun phrase is underlined.
    In (127), the head of the noun phrase uwr ‘man’ is modified by the
embedded postpositional noun phrase yeik-ompow non ‘with bow and
arrows’. The noun phrase is marked by the masculine marker se which
agrees in number and gender with the head of the noun phrase uwr ‘man’.
    (127) Hakwe          uwr yeik-ompow non se
            ha-kwe       uwr yeik-ompow non s-e

            lira huon
            see OBJ>SUB
            ‘I saw a man coming with bow and arrows.’
     Embedded postpositional phrases with non affect the gender marking
on the NP they modify. In (128), the noun phrase head ney ‘child’ is
modified by the embedded postpositional noun phrase owk non ‘with
string bag’. This sentence was taken from a story about a male child. The
noun phrase, however, is marked by the feminine object marker ke which
does not agree in gender with the head of the noun phrase ney ‘child’. It is
assumed that the object marker for this noun phrase with the embedded
postpositional phrase is selected on the basis of the total physical
appearance of the entity encoded.
100      (128) Hokwe           sa         ney owk              non

            ‘She carried the child with (in) the string bag.’
    A noun phrase modified by an embedded postpositional phrase can
also be topicalised. In (129), the NP is marked by the general NP topic
marker kokwe.
    (129) Hiykwe        huok-nays owk              non kokwe,       kamon,

            ‘As for the pig tusks with (= in) the string bag, he carried one

3.9.4 Similarity
   The postposition of similarity or resemblance eyn ‘like’ can modify
nouns (130), personal pronouns (131) and modifiers (132).
      In (130), eyn modifies the genitive construction it follows.
      (130) Hmo            owh mokwe            now mo         ma
              hom-o        owh mo-kwe           now m-o        ma

              SIM be
              ‘Their skin is like the leaves of a tree.’
    In (131), the NP hano eyn is a NP with an ellipted head. The
postposition eyn modifies the genitive pronoun and its ellipted head pen.
    (131) Pen sohokwe                hano    eyn lira.
            pen so-ho-kwe            han-o eyn lira

    (132) Onkioh         hakwe peik non, sawk pokon hakwe
            onkioh       ha-kwe peik non sawk pokon ha-kwe

            good      SIM be
            ‘Yesterday I was sick, but today I feel somewhat alright.’
3.9.5 Accompaniment
     Human accompaniment is encoded by an object NP marked by the
postposition marker nion. The noun in this phrase is obligatorily animate,
as illustrated in (133). The object marker does not indicate that the NP is
the object of the clause, but rather that it is the object of the postposition
nion. In spite of the presence of the object marker, the accompaniment NP
is analysed as a single NP. The intonation pattern over the clause seems to
confirm this. Normally a NP final object marker can be followed by a
pause, but there is no pause between the object marker se and the
postpositional marker nion.
    In (133), places where a speaker pauses or can potentially pause are
indicated by '. The bolded post-positional NP forms one intonational unit.
     (133) Hakwe 'hano aio             se         nion 'huok
            ha-kwe han-o aio           s-e        nion huok

            lanio lous ley
            walk chase INCH
            ‘I am going to hunt pigs with my father.’
    Accompaniment can also be marked on a NP consisting only of a
personal pronoun. In (134), the pronoun is marked for object and followed
by nion.
    (134) Wayh ara,            hane      nion ley e.
            wayh ara           han-e     nion ley e

            ‘Friend, just come with me.’
1023.9.6 Comparative
    Like the NP Accompaniment, the NP Comparative hosts an object
marker, which does not function as the object of the clause, but as the
object of the postposition. The NP Comparative is marked by the direct
object and the postpositional marker hieyn. The NP forms one intonational
unit.
     (135) Huok homkwe           howniy ke          hieyn liy sau.
            huok hom-kwe howniy k-e                 hieyn liy sau

            ‘Pigs are able to run like the wind.’
    Comparative can also be marked on a NP consisting only of a personal
pronoun. In (136), the pronoun is marked for object and followed by
hieyn.
    (136) Hunkwe         hane hieyn lon e.
           hwon-kwe han-e hieyn lon e
           2S-TOP        1S-OBJ COMP do OBJ.IMP
           ‘Just do like me.’
3.9.7 Ablative
    Noun phrases functioning in the ablative case are marked by the
ablative marker ko followed by one of the object markers se, ke or me.
The ablative ko is homophonous with the genitive feminine ko, but in
contrast to the genitive marker, the ablative marker ko does not change for
gender or number.
     The object marker following the ablative ko is governed by the subject
in terms of its person and number. In (137), the feminine object marker ke
in the underlined NP corresponds to the feminine subject hokwe.
     (137) Hokwe            yier kamon ko ke                ma-le.
             hok-kwe        yier kamon ko k-e               ma-le
             3S.F.SUB-TOP place one.CL2 ABL 3S.F-OBJ RPT-come
             ‘She came back from a certain village.’
     Likewise, the object marker of the ablative noun phrase in (138) and
(139) corresponds in gender and number to the subject and not to the head
of its NP. In (138) the noun now ‘tree’ is masculine, but the object marker
corresponds with the gender of the subject.
                                                                       103    (138) Hokwe        now ayaw ko ke             loksow.

          ‘She came down from the tree top.’
     In (139), the plural object marker me in the underlined NP corresponds
to the plural subject mu homkwe (crocodiles).
     (139) Mu             homkwe     hu-ouon        ko me
             mu           hom-kwe hu-ouon           ko m-e

             DIR:up-come.to.surface OBJ<SUB
             ‘The crocodiles came up out of the water.’
    In (140), the object marker se in the underlined NP agrees with the
subject hiykwe in gender and number, and not with the head of its NP, the
feminine noun sey ‘platform’.
    (140) Hiykwe           sawk sey         ko se
            hiy-kwe        sawk sey         ko s-e

            ‘He jumped down – unsuccessfully – from the platform.’
3.9.8 Topicalisation of postpositional phrases
    It was previously noted that phrases that are marked for subject or
object can only be topicalised by the feminine topic marker kokwe. The
same is true for postpositional phrases. They can only be topicalised by
the feminine kokwe even if the headof the NP has masculine gender or
plural number.
    In (141), the feminine general NP topic marker kokwe topicalises the
bolded NP that hosts the locative marker mon.
104      (141) Hiykwe          yoh-ney       senkin       senkin

            ‘He went around planting various banana shoots in his new

   In (142), the feminine topic marker kokwe occurs phrase finally in a
NP that is marked by nion ‘accompaniment’. The head of the NP is
masculine, but NPs already marked for syntactic or semantic case are
always topicalised by the feminine topic marker.

    As in (141) and (142), topicalised NPs which also host a semantic
marker often occur in tail position. It is possible though, for a topicalised
NP with a semantic marker to occur more sentence initially, as is shown in
(143).

     The subject demonstrative can occur in constructions with the
semantic case markers sok (exactness) and non (comitative) where the
demonstrative loses its subject force (compare §3.8.3). The construction
of a subject demonstrative followed by a topicalised semantic case marker
is rare and has only been observed for these temporal phrases. The bolded
NPs contain the subject demonstrative sohiy with the semantic markers sok
(144) and with non (145).

    This section outlines the structure of the noun phrase. Four noun
phrase types are posited.

    b. Headless noun phrase
    c. Noun phrase headed by a personal pronoun
    d. Conjoined NP

    The standard NP occurs with an obligatory head, an optional pre-head
and potentially five optional post-head modifying constituents. The head
consists of a noun or a nominal compound. The highest pitch within the
noun phrase is on the first syllable of the head. The pre-head constituent is
a possessive modifier, realised by a genitive pronoun or by a genitive
prepositional phrase. The post-head modifying constituents describe the
nominal head, or its deictic position in the communication situation. The
constituents of the standard noun phrase are ordered in Table 30.","[89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"
"9.4 Object complement clauses encoding
purpose
    Purpose can be expressed by an embedded clause marked by the
purpose marker e, or, less frequently, by an object NP immediately
preceding a verb phrase that contains a motion verb.
     The latter construction is shown in (27). The NP hmo ai la enekwei se
consists of an object NP modified by the embedded clause ai la. The head
of the noun phrase enekwei ‘time’ is marked by the singular masculine
object marker se. The object noun phrase cannot have the role of patient
within a clause that has a VP that consists of an intransitive motion verb
(le ‘come’). The object NP does not have the role of patient but of purpose.
      (27) Uwrsa            lowpwarowp homkwe           hmo
             uwr-sa         lowpwarowp hom-kwe hom-o

             food eat time         3S.M-OBJ PFT INT-come
             ‘All the people had arrived for their food-eating time.’
360    The purpose clause occurs more frequently. It is analysed as a
predicate complement clause which is embedded in the main clause. It
also precedes the VP that consists of one or more intransitive verbs. The
complement purpose clause modifies the VP it precedes. The modifying
purpose clause has its own verb phrase and is always marked by the
clause-final object complementiser e.
    The embedded purpose clause can contain its own internal object as in
(28) or consist of just a single verb as in (29).
    In (28), the NP object huk ‘hook’ in the underlined purpose clause is
not marked for topic or object, since it is an incorporated noun (see
§3.11.1). The purpose clause is a predicate complement to the main clause
verb ley ‘go’.
      (28) Hohkwe sawk ki-mawk               kamon mon
             hoh-kwe sawk ki-mawk            kamon mon

             ‘The two of them went to a peninsula in order to throw out
             hooks.’
      In (29), the underlined purpose clause consists of just the VP.
        (29) Hyo           sah            hok      me,      uwr-uh

               ‘His wife said to the husband, “Man, I did not scoop crayfish
               for the purpose of eating them.”’
     It is important to note that this objective marker e does not exclusively
occur in complement clauses but also in main clauses as is illustrated in
the two examples below.
                                                                       361    In (30), the clause-final objective marker e occurs in two different
clauses. The objective marker e marks the clause for imperative with an
adhortative flavour (see §7.1). Adhortative mood does not have the force
of a command; it is rather an appeal to find a mutally agreeable plan of
action.
      (30) Sawk prueyn hiy me,             “Ki      lous e,
            sawk prueyn hiy me             ki       lous e

            ‘But one man said, “Let’s chase them, let’s hunt down and eat
            pigs and cassowaries.”’
    In a similar way in (31), the clause-final objective marker e marks the
clause for adhortative imperative.
      (31) Ha ma-sahre me,              “Ohow, hakwe senkin
             ha ma-sahre me             ohow        ha-kwe so-enkin

             ‘I replied, “No, I think that we should return to the village.
             (Or: I think, let’s go back to the village.)”’
    As already demonstrated above, the clause-final object marker e ‘OBJ’
is widely used to mark embedded clauses that express purpose. The
semantic meaning of the main verb modified by the complement clause
allows for various expressions of purpose, e.g. volition, desire, goal,
intention, etc.
    Volition or desire is expressed by an object complement clause
marked by e ‘OBJ’ preceding the verb nan ‘think’ (32) or by preceding the
verb mon ‘do, make’ (33).

9.4.1 Object complement clauses
    It is possible to modify the head of a noun phrase with an embedded
clause that consists of an object complement clause plus the verb modified
by the complement clause. In order to demonstrate this a basic object
noun phrase is given in (37).
      (37) Hiykwe        sawk sa-sokruan       prueyn ke           lira.
             hiy-kwe sawk sa-sokruan           prueyn k-e          lira
             3S.M-TOP CHD woman-young one               3S.F-OBJ see
             ‘He saw a young woman.’
    A noun phrase can be modified by an adjectival clause that marks
simultaneous or current action (§6.6.5). In (38), the underlined adjectival
clause hok le ‘3S.F come’ modifies the head of the noun phrase sa-sokruan
‘young woman’.
     (38) Hiykwe        sawk sa-sokruan        prueyn hok le
            hiy-kwe sawk sa-sokruan            prueyn hok le
            3S.M-TOP CHD woman-young one                3S.F come

            3S.F-OBJ see
             ‘He saw a young woman coming.’
    In (39), the object complement clause hu lows e is embedded within
the adjectival clause hok le. The complement clause modifies the
embedded clause for purpose. The noun phrase marker ke continues to
agree in gender and number with the head of the noun phrase sa-sokruan
‘woman-young’.
364      (39) Hiykwe     sawk sa-sokruan     prueyn
           hiy-kwe sawk sa-sokruan        prueyn

           3S.F water collect PURP come 3S.F-OBJ see
           ‘He saw a young woman coming to get water.’9.5 Subordinate clause relating to the main
clause
    A subordinate clause precedes the main clause unless it is placed in
P3 position which is relatively rare. A subordinate clause contrasts with
the main clause in two areas.
    a. Intonation. A subordinate clause does not have a sentence final
        clause contour but ends with a mid-level tone that anticipates
        another clause.
    b. Marking. The subordinate clause occurs with a clause-final
        marker which is intonationally bound to it.
9.5.1 Temporal construction consisting of a deleted NP
with a relative clause
    One temporal construction already discussed before (§6.6.2) consists
of a noun phrase with a relative clause that modifies the deleted head of
the NP.
    In (40), the bolded attributive clause modifies the deleted head
enekwei ‘time’. This construction is very commonly used to express
temporal relationships. The construction is marked by the masculine topic
marker hokwe. The intonation of this NP with an embedded clause is very
similar to temporal clauses marked by e.g. menkin ‘when’ and ankin ‘if’.
In (40), the bolded attributive clause modifies the deleted head enekwei
‘time’. (The latter is marked by Ø).
      (40) Ø Ha serey              ma lwak hokwe,
                 ha so-rey         ma lwak ho-kwe

            1S-TOP INT-fear
            ‘When I was there, I was really afraid.’
    The construction above can be used to express temporal, locative or
contents relationships. In (41), the bolded clause modifies an ellipted head
which refers to contents. One could posit ok ‘talk’ for the ellipted head.
     (41) Ø Aio          hiy huok ma inakok hokwe,
                  aio    hiy huok ma inakok ho-kwe

             ‘As for the talk that father was hunting pigs, I did not know
             it.’
9.5.2 Subordinate clauses encoding past temporal
notions
    All temporal clauses that refer to an event or state that is viewed as
belonging to the past, co-occur with a main clause marked for perfective.
Two temporal clauses should be distinguished: subordinate temporal
clauses marked by menkin ‘when’ and by ankin ‘as, while’. A subordinate
clause marked by menkin should be thought of as a single past event
which functions as a time referent for the main clause. This overlaps with
the perfective. A subordinate clause marked by ankin should be thought of
as a state of affairs in process which impacts the main clause. This
overlaps with the imperfective.
    A clause marked by menkin views a time period as a single, unified
event belonging to the past. The state of affairs in the main clause is
placed within a time frame by the subordinate clause. This temporal
clause is not impacting the state of affairs in the main clause apart from
supplying it with a time referent. All subordinate clauses marked by
menkin ‘when’ are followed by a main clause that is marked for the
perfective.
   In (42), the temporal clause is marked by menkin ‘when’. The event
marked in the subordinate clause is viewed as one single, completed
366event. The temporal conjunction menkin relates the subordinate clause to
the main clause in regard to the specific time the activity took place.

    Subordinate clauses are analysed as a topicalised constituent within
the topic part of a sentence. In (43), the temporal constituent marked by
menkin is analysed as a topicalised constituent, along with three other
constituents marked by -kwe. The subordinate clause marked by menkin
requires perfective marking for the main clause. The temporal subordinate
clause does not need to be the first constituent in the sentence, as can be
seen below.

analysed as temporal constituents that are part of the topic component of
the sentence. The clause marked by hokwe is a relative clause that marks
the deleted head enkewei ‘time’. The subordinate clause marked by
menkin supplies the main clause with a time referent. The verb phrase in
the main clause is marked for perfective.

Temporal clause marked by ankin
    When ankin modifies a temporal clause, the state of affairs within the
clause is not viewed as a single completed past event, but as an open event
in process which contains conditions and circumstances that impact the
main clause. Ankin is more than a time reference; it indicates that the state
of affairs within the temporal clause impacts the state of affairs in the
main clause.
    The marker ankin can either mark temporal clauses or conditional
clauses. This section deals with ankin as a temporal clause marker. When
ankin marks a temporal clause, the subordinate clause is followed by a
main clause marked for the perfective. When ankin marks a conditional,
or circumstantial clause (§9.5.3), the subordinate clause is followed by a
main clause marked for the imperfective.
368    In (45), ankin marks a past temporal clause and the main clause is
therefore obligatorily marked for perfective. The state of affairs in the
subordinate clause and in the main clause effect one another.

            ‘While he was trying - with no good results - to cut sago
            leaves, his knife cut his mouth with its sharpness.’
    In (46), the use of ankin rather than menkin indicates that the state of
affairs in the subordinate clause is not only given as a single time
reference. The marker ankin indicates that there is a relationship between
the development of the state of affairs in the subordinate clause and the
state of affairs in the main clause.

    The subordinate clause in (47) states an ongoing process that led to
the state of affairs in the main clause.

9.5.3 Conditional relationships between clauses
     A subordinate clause marked by ankin that is followed by a main
clause marked for imperfective expresses a conditional or a circumstantial
relationship.
    In the following three examples, circumstances or conditions are in
focus, rather than time of the event.

           ‘When we want to eat taro, we will first look for a good piece
           of land.’
     In examples (51) and (52) there is no imperfective marked in the two
main clauses since both main verbs are followed by clause-final markers,
respectively ey ‘INTN’, and a which in combination with the modal marker
po indicates imminent future. The conjunction ankin functions in these
examples the same way as if the imperfective were used: the subordinate
clause specifies conditions or circumstances that impact the state of affairs
in the main clause.
       (51) Hiykwe       hane     senkin         me,    “Pokon

9.5.4 Clauses in a sequential relationship
    Clauses marked by the clause-final sequential marker nok are
subordinate clauses. A clause can only be marked by nok when the
subjects of both clauses are co-referential. Any clause that follows a
clause marked by the sequential conjunction nok undergoes obligatory
subject deletion and possibly even object deletion. The final main clause
is marked for imperfective, but is not, as is often the case with the Abau
imperfective, translated by an English present tense. From the perspective
of the story teller, the event of this final main clause is still in progress. It
has begun but it has not been terminated within the story line presented.
The final VP is therefore marked imperfective.
    In (53), the main clause of the first sentence is yier mon nakey. The
subject hom ‘2/3PL.SUB’ is obligatorily deleted. It is repeated in the
subordinate clause of the second sentence, since this clause does not
immediately follow a clause marked by the sequential marker nok. The
main clause of the second sentence is la ‘eat’. The NP subject is
obligatorily deleted. The NP object is omitted as well, although this is not
a direct result of the sequential marker nok, since the NP object was
omitted in the subordinate clause as well.
      (53) Hom           huok se              way nok nok, yier
             hom         huok s-e             lway nok nok yier

             ‘They carried the pig along and then brought (it) to the
             village. They cut (it) up and then they were eating (it).’
    In (54), the subject hakwe ‘I’ is obligatorily deleted in the two clauses
following the clause marked by the sequential marker nok. It is
noteworthy that the NP object mentioned in the second clause is also
omitted (along with the NP subject) in the main clause. The main clause
372only consists of the verb phrase hiy-naw, ‘roam’. It is set apart from the
preceding subordinate clauses by its distinctive clause-final intonation. It
is marked with imperfective aspect, which indicates that the event is in
progress, but has not been terminated.

            ‘But I went back to the village and then took the dogs and
            then began roaming around with them.’
    In (55), the subject hom ‘2/3PL.SUB’ is obligatorily deleted in all
clauses that follow a clause marked by the sequential conjunction nok. It
is noteworthy that the second and third clause refer to different direct
objects, yia ke ‘fire’ and an me ‘cat fish’. The final clause is the main
clause where both subject and object are deleted. The NP subject is
supplied from the first clause where it was referred to. The NP object is
supplied from the last clause that contained a NP object.

             ‘They climbed up all the way, and then made a fire and then
             cooked catfish and then they were sitting down eating it all.’
    In (56), the main clause is ma-le ‘RPT-come’ and occurs without a
subject. The subject hakwe ‘1S.SUB’ is supplied in the first subordinate
clause marked by nok. Since the verb in the last clause is a motion verb,
no NP object needs to be supplied.
                                                                        373     (56) Hakwe          naw la hain             nok, ompow ke

    The sequential marker nok can be used in three different ways. In all
three constructions the marker nok places events referred to in a sequential
order. However, additional grammatical marking in the main clause
results in three different usages.
    1. A sequence of events in the past. The main clause is marked for
         imperfective. The overall sentence refers to events that took place
         in the past, though from the perspective of the story teller, the
         event in the main clause is described as still in progress. See
         examples (53) and (54).
    2. A sequence of events framed as an imperative. The main clause is
         marked for perfective. The whole sentence has imperative force.
         See examples (57) and (58).
    3. A sequence of events which imply habitual or future aspect. The
         main clause is marked by the clause marker ok. See examples (59)
         through (61).","[373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387]"

    The default gender is feminine. However, when the speaker knows that he is referring to
    a male cassowary, the noun is marked masculine.
                                                                         51     (34) Hunkwe        hyo        pen se            lira o?

          ‘Do you see his pen? Do you see his radio?’
    The same lexical entry can appear with either gender marking,
according to the speaker’s perception of the entity. Consider example
(35).
      (35) a. howk-hrou kokwe
               ‘roundly formed fishing lake’ (feminine)
           b. howk-hrou hokwe
               ‘long stretched-out fishing lake’ (masculine)
    The compound noun howk-hrou ‘fishing lake’ normally occurs with a
feminine general topic marker, based on its two-dimensional roundness
(or possibly the smoothness of the surface area). However, in the case of
(35b), the feature of extendedness is in focus, so the noun occurs with the
masculine general topic marker.
     Other examples have been observed in texts. Depending on the
perspective of the speaker, the words makwey ‘head’ and yeik ‘spear’ can
be assigned masculine or feminine gender. When the speaker wants to
refer to the flat top part of the head, he may express that either with the
compound noun makwey-kokway ‘the flat part of the head’, or by
assigning feminine gender to the single noun makwey. In that case, the flat
part of the head is understood. Conversely, by assigning masculine gender
to the noun makwey, the complete head is understood.

             ‘head’ (focus is on flat part of the head) (feminine)
             makwey hokwe
             ‘head’ (focus is on complete head) (masculine)
     Likewise, if for yeik ‘spear’ the focus is on its sharp point made by a
flat blade, yeik occurs with a feminine marker. However, if the long shaft
of the spear is the focus, the noun occurs with a masculine marker.
52    When the speaker wants to focus on unusual size he may change the
gender on the noun. Smaller animals like wompow ‘mouse’ tend to be
marked feminine. Our current data corpus has one example where
wompow ‘mouse’ is marked masculine when it was qualified by the
adjective aiopey ‘big’.
3.3.2 Gender change on temporal NPs
    The phrase final marking of a noun phrase always agrees with the
head of the NP in terms of gender and number. However, the gender
marking of temporal noun phrases seems to be inconsistent. Temporal
nouns when marked by an objective marker as in (37) are always marked
by a masculine objective marker. However, when this same noun is
marked phrase finally by a topic marker as in (38) and (39), the NP marker
can be either feminine (38) or masculine (39). There is no easy
explanation at hand to explain this variance in gender choice.

            ‘At a certain night a certain man tried - without desired result

    When editing texts, native speakers seem to be inconsistent in
assigning gender to temporal constructions. Sometimes, they reverse
changes that they made before. In the case of temporal noun phrases, it
appears that masculine marking occurs when the NP is foreground
information, as in (37) and that it is more likely to be feminine when it is
topicalised background information. Example (39) however has a
topicalised NP that is assigned masculine gender. Topicalised NPs
apparently can be both masculine and feminine and it appears that the
more left-located a temporal NP is, the more likely it is assigned feminine
gender.
    Example (40) starts out with two topicalised temporal phrases that
follow each other. The most left located NP is marked feminine and the NP
following is marked masculine.

     In this section numerals and their place within the noun phrase are
discussed (§3.4.1). It includes comments on the use of numerals above
three (§3.4.2) and also a discussion on the numerals one to three which are
realised by twelve different numeral sets (§3.4.3). Size and appearance of
the noun modified by the numeral play an important role in the selection
of the numerals. The various usages of the numeral one are highlighted
54(§3.4.4). Finally, the declining use of the numeral classifier system is
commented on (§3.4.5) and the section concludes with a discussion of
how the criteria on which basis numerals are assigned to nouns, and the
criteria on which basis the gender of a noun is determined overlap and
differ from one another (§3.4.6).
3.4.1 Numerals and NP order
    Numerals follow the head noun of a noun phrase, and agree in class
with the noun they modify. (The twelve noun classes are discussed in
section §3.4.3). The Abau number system is limited in its scope. English
and Tok Pisin numbers are used for numbers above twelve, and often even
for numbers lower than twelve. Traditionally, there was no easy way to
express quantities above 20 or even above 12. The use of higher numbers
has been mainly introduced through the formal school system which is in
English. Abau speakers will therefore use the English forms of the
numerals even if the pronunciation of the numerals is affected by their use
of Tok Pisin and Abau. The use of the loanword numeral apparently
triggers English and Tok Pisin grammatical ordering. When an Abau
numeral is used the numeral will follow the noun as in (41).
      (41) Hakwe          yeyk kreys        se          lira.
            Ha-kwe        yeyk kreys        s-e         lira

            ‘I saw two canoes’
     In (42), the loan word numeral ‘201’ precedes the noun under
influence of English and Tok Pisin grammatical ordering.
       (42) Hohkwe          hane    kokwe     sawk 201 kina

3.4.2 Abau numbers above three
     Abau numerals are in reasonably frequent use up to five. The numbers
six to twelve are used to a much lesser extent. Above that, the numeral for
                                                                        5520 is sometimes used. Table 18 indicates the various ways numbers from
4-12 as well as 20 can be expressed.

systems’. He says “the latter are used only for direct counting, or
‘mapping’ of a set of objects against some other measuring code. There
are no ‘numerals’ in a tally system, so that one may not receive a reply to
56the question ‘how many?’, or find the points of the tally-system qualifying
nouns, as do true numerals. The typical tally-systems of languages of the
New Guinea area are the ‘body-parts’ counting systems.” (Laycock 1975:
219). Later, he mentions Abau as an example of a language which has
both a body-parts tally-system and a numeral system which is quinary (i.e.
has distinct numbers up to 5) (Laycock 1975: 222).
    The numbers below have been observed in contexts where they
qualify nouns. This might not have been always the case. Abau speakers
have been observed to think for a short while before they can match
numbers above five with the corresponding Abau number expressions.
The attempt to use Abau number expressions to modify nouns might be
the result of education and numeracy in the English language. It has been
observed that many Abau speakers use English numerals for quantities
above five. Abau numerals are used as the following example from a
written story illustrates:     (43) Aiai       mokwe         sankaw            lwawk, nar iha
          Ai-ai      mo-kwe        so-ankaw          lwawk nar iha

          DDEM-MAN go.into
          ‘Fish got into (the net) to this degree, five pikes, one catfish
          and ten weir fish.’
3.4.3 Abau numerals one, two and three
    Nouns can be divided into two groups on the basis of their gender
(masculine and feminine). They can also be divided into twelve groups on
the basis of what numeral they occur with. These numerals are in
Aikhenvald’s terminology numeral classifiers (Aikhenvald 2000: 17).
    Whereas the gender of a noun is indicated through noun phrase
markers, the numeral class of a noun is determined by the set of numerals
used for 1, 2, and 3. These class concordances are only expressed by the
                                                                                      57first three numbers. Numbers above four (see Table 18) can be used to
modify all countable nouns.
     The order in which the twelve numeral classes are listed below
follows Laycock and Z’graggen (1975: 745-746). The numeral classifiers
in class 1 to 7 mark relatively large groups of nouns, while the numeral
classifiers in class 8 to 12 can only be used with a small number of nouns.
This is in all likelihood caused by the fact that the numeral classifiers in
class 8 through 12 express many more specifics than only quantity. Not
only their number, but also their grouping (e.g. bundles), or their partition
(e.g. chopped-up parts) can be in focus. In English, grouping words like
flock, bunch, bundle, etc. only occur with a limited number of nouns.
Similarly, it can be assumed that Abau numeral classifiers that express
specifics about the form or compilation of the noun they modify have a
very limited distribution.
    Criteria for the different classes are related to humanness, surface,
grouping, dimensionality, and extendedness. Countable nouns which
cannot be classified by their physical appearance are not restricted to one
class; they belong to classes 2, 3 or 4.
    The distinction between human and non-human within the numeral
classifiers is observed by all speakers, but young people do not seem to be
aware of all the other distinctions. They tend to overuse class 2 as a
default for nearly all non-human nouns.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71]"
"4.1 Verbal and adverbial constituents
contrasted
     Adverbial constituents and verbal constituents tend to follow each
other. It is therefore important to state on what basis words within a clause
are viewed as part of the verb phrase or as part of an adverbial phrase. The
differences between verbal constituents and adverbial constituents are
listed below. Secondly, it is also important to make explicit how the
boundaries of the verb phrase are established, see §4.1.1.
    Verbal constituents:
       1. can occur as the only constituent of the verb phrase;
       2. are affected by the morphophonemic process of initial
            l-deletion (see §2.6.1);
       3. can be preceded by a modal marker;
       4. can carry the highest pitch within the VP and even the clause.
    Adverbial constituents:
       1. cannot occur as the only constituent of the verb phrase;
       2. do not undergo initial l-deletion;
                                    123
124        3. cannot be preceded by a modal marker;
        4. cannot carry the highest pitch within the VP or clause.
4.1.1 Determining the boundaries of the verb phrase
    Verb phrase boundaries are defined with the help of three important
features. They are listed here in order of their usefulness in the
determination of verb phrase boundaries:
    a. The beginning of the verb phrase is easily recognisable since it
        always carries the most salient stress which is associated with the
        highest pitch within the clause, see (1);
    b. A number of markers which are not part of the verb phrase work
        together to form negation and interrogative constructions that
        enclose the entire verb phrase, see (2) and (3);
    c. Phrases in Abau are frequently separated by distinct pauses. If
        there is a pause, one can assume it marks the end of a phrase,
        since a pause does not occur within a phrase. Not every phrase is
        clearly separated by pauses, but there is often a distinct pause
        between the last topicalised constituent within the clause and the
        non-topicalised constituent following, see (4).
    In (1), yaprue ‘good’ is not part of the VP since it does not carry the
most salient stress within the clause. The most prominent stress within the
clause is on lie ‘go.up’ and this signals the beginning of the VP. Therefore,
yaprue ‘good’ is analysed as a separate adverbial modifier modifying the
verb phrase.
                                                                     PEAK

           ‘The food that he planted grew really well.’
   Secondly, a number of constructions that mark negation or questions
make use of constituents that enclose the entire verb phrase.
    In (2), the VP is embraced by two constituents that express negated
dynamic modality liy … ley ‘DYN … NEG’. The modal marker liy ‘DYN’ is
not part of the VP since it does not carry the highest pitch. The negation
word ley is not part of the verb phrase since it functions at sentence level.
The VP is underlined and the onset of the VP is marked by an apostrophe.
                                                                         125       (2) Aiai hiy ma saro somokwe                     liy

           ‘The food that he planted cannot grow really well.’
     In (3), the VP is embraced by the interrogative paneke ‘why’ and the
speech marker o. The interrogative paneke is not part of the VP since the
most salient stress (and also associated highest pitch) is carried by mon
‘do’. The speech marker o is not part of the verb phrase since it functions
at sentence level.

              ‘He then said this, “For what reason was I made so terrified in
              the night?”’
    In (4), a clear pause occurs after the last topicalised phrase within the
clause.
        (4) Arawh kokwe              uwr sohokwe
             arawh     ko-kwe        uwr so-ho-kwe

             INT-go     OBJ<SUB
             ‘In regard to this man he really went (from there).’
    The pause separates the NP uwr sohokwe from the verb phrase nuw-ey
ha. The onset of the verb phrase is not only marked by the preceding
pause but also by the presence of the most salient stress within the clause
on the onset of the VP.
126
4.2     Verbs
     Verbs are structurally different from nouns and modifiers as they are
the only word class of which the members occur with the verbal prefixes
listed in Tables 33 and 34 below. Verbs do not take affixes for person,
gender or tense, but can carry the verb phrase final distinctive intonation
that contrasts the perfective and the imperfective. In (5a-e), the verb meio
‘work’ occurs without affixation in five sentences that have subjects that
differ in person and gender. Various temporal phrases place the event in
the past, present or future without affecting the form of the clause-final
verb.
        (5) a. Onkioh        hiykwe          yier     mon meiò.
                 onkioh      hiy-kwe         yier     mon meiò
                 yesterday 3S.M.SUB-TOP village LOC work.PFTV
                 ‘Yesterday he worked in the village.’
             b. Onkioh hromkwe yier mon meiò.
                 ‘Yesterday we worked in the village.’
             c. Enkin kokwe hokwe yier mon meiô.
                 ‘At this time she is working in the village.’
             d. Hokwe yier mon meiô.
                 ‘She is working in the village.’
             e. Hokwe yier mon meiò.
                 ‘She worked in the village.’
    The marking on the final vowel of the verb phrase reflects verb phrase
final intonation. Verb phrase final intonation is analysed as an aspectual
contrast between the perfective (marked by `) and the imperfective
(marked by ^). The relationship between intonation and verbal aspect is
discussed in §5.1.
    Motion verbs, transitive and intransitive verbs do not manifest any
contrastive morphology on the verb itself or on the verb phrase. Verbs can
therefore not be divided into different semantic classes on the basis of
their own morphology or the presence of particular markers within the
verb phrase.
4.2.1 Verb prefixes
   The verb takes a number of prefixes encoding manner and direction.

    The 12 directional prefixes cannot co-occur with each other. The
prefix adds spatial and directional information to the verb it is attached to.
Spatial distinctions are made in regard to
        x   proximity: ‘near’ (am-), ‘at some distance’ (a-), and ‘right
            there’ (amor-);
        x   vertical distinctions: ‘down’ (kyor-) and ‘up’ (ar-);
        x   horizontal distinctions: ‘side’ (ka-), ‘across, one side to
            another’ (kay-) and ‘straight’ (lay-);
        x   movement from the river (lam-) and movement towards the
            river (lak-);
        x   location in downstream direction (lik-) and location in
            upstream direction (lim-).
    In (6), the prefix lay- with the verb hiok ‘paddle upstream’ expresses
the action of paddling in a straight line in upstream direction. The prefix
lim- with the verb lwak ‘to be’ expresses location in an area that is defined
                                                                         129as upstream area (nuw- is treated below; it indicates a level of intensity or

of ‘throwing towards the river’.

    The rest of this section focuses on the manner prefixes. Several of the
examples below and elsewhere in the paper contain instances of
directional prefixes. For quick reference:
    Proximity prefixes a-, amor- (8) and am- (15).
    Horizontal direction prefixes ka- (12), kay- (53) in §11.1.1, and
        lay- (6).
    Vertical direction prefixes kyor- (140) in §3.9.7 and ar- (11).
    Prefixes with reference to the river lak- (7), lam-, lik- and lim- (6).
    The verbal prefix ma- often means ‘again’ indicating the repetition of
a certain action. It is used that way in (8), where the agent repeats the
action of standing and listening.

           this, “Kwe, kwe, kwe.” He then – as a result – came towards

    The scope of ma- can be broadened to refer to a further, but different
action by the same person in the same context. The meaning of the prefix
ma- shifts from ‘again’ to ‘also’. The latter use is illustrated in (9) where
ma-me-woro ‘RPT-speak-console’ does not refer to a repeated instance of
the action of consolation, but to a further action of the agent that was
performed as well (i.e. she laughed at the child and then also consoled the
child).

kiy- ‘ACT’. In (9) are two instances of the prefix nuw- ‘INT’. They both
express intensity of action. The prefix kiy- refers to the verb as an actual
event that is or needs to be executed. It is often used with verbs referring
to speech: a certain statement is made, or a question is asked. In (10), the
prefixed verb kiy-a refers to the actual execution of the event of eating.
      (10) Hror a           monaw        non-wak ankin, po

             ‘When we will be in the house, what are we going to eat

    The prefix non- ‘DU’ is only used in reference to humans. The prefix
is nearly always present on the main verb when the subject of the clause
has dual number. There is an overlap in meaning with non ‘comitative’
(see §3.9.3) since both express the idea of single entities working together.
However, the verbal prefix non- is grammatically quite different from the
NP final marker non. The latter marker does not require or imply dual
number, while the prefix non- always implies dual number.
    The prefix non- ‘DU’ contrasts with nak- ‘ACC’ on the features of
humanness and agency. The prefix non- ‘DU’ implies two humans who are
together in an agent role. The prefix nak- ‘ACC’ implies the
accompaniment of a non-human constituent which is not in agent role.
     Examples (11) and (12) are part of the same story. The prefix non- in
non-hiy-naw conveys the presence of a human subject with dual number.
The use of nak- in nak-a in (12) expresses a non-human constituent (in
this case sowk ‘sago jelly’) which does not have agent role.

    The prefix hiy- ‘CAUS’ implies a subject which controls or causes the
event or state expressed by the predicate. In (11), the prefix hiy- occurs
twice. In both instances it refers to the fact that the agent controls or
causes the dog to hunt. Ki ley ‘hunting’ (literally ‘ground go’) is expressed
as ki hiy-ey to convey the control of the hunters over the dog. The same is
true for hiy- in non-hiy-naw. The prefix hiy- implies the presence of a
constituent that is under the control of the agent. The constituent that is
under the control of the agent is always animate and frequently human, as

and (46) in §5.3.2.
    The prefixes saw- ‘SPD’ and kor- ‘LIM’ assign to the verb increased

elsewhere: (15), (73) in §7.4.2, (53) in §8.6.2, and (62) in §10.2.3, and

     Locatives very rarely intervene between an object marked non-

In (58), the speaker treats the non-topicalised noun phrase yier mon ‘to the

    Other postpositional phrases can precede the verb phrase as well, and
occur after a non-topicalised object NP. In (59), the postpositional phrase
marked for exactness occurs after the Object NP, because the speaker
treats the information where the person was hit as the most prominent
information.

by the comparative -e hieyn ‘like’ can also precede the verb phrase but it
never follows an Object NP.

    When the speaker assumes the addressee can identify a referent
without further reference, the NP representing that entity may be deleted.
This is most obvious in procedural texts where the focus is on the activity
rather than on the one who performs the activity. The speaker treats the
subject as given or background information, and often mentions the
subject only once, at the beginning of a procedural or descriptive text, as
in (62) to (66), where the narrator tells about a man who built a house.
The explicit subject hiykwe ‘3S.M.SUB-TOP’ is only used once, at the
beginning of the narrative. This contrasts with the free translation in
English, which requires a free personal pronoun in every clause.

    The ellipsis of object NPs happens in a similar manner, but occurs
more often than subject NP ellipsis. In (67), the object NP huok se ‘pig
3S.M.OBJ’ is overtly present only in the first sentence. It is ellipted in
subsequent sentences, because its referential status carries over.

    There are two main types of nominalised clauses: relative clauses
(§6.6) and object complement clauses (§9.4). The relative clause is
marked by the complementiser ma. Several definitions exist of the relative
clause. We will adopt Keenan’s (1985:141-2) definition of a relative
clause as a full noun phrase consisting of a nominal head, a determiner
and a restrictive clause. In Abau there is no structural difference between
a restrictive and unrestrictive relative clause. Since this section is
concerned with structure, the word ‘restrictive’ here should be understood
as referring to both categories. Relative clauses modify the head of a NP,
and are linked to the head by a relativiser. The relative clause may either
precede (§6.6.1) or follow (§6.6.2) the head it modifies.
6.6.1 Relative clauses preceding the head noun
      Relative clauses preceding the head they modify are normally marked
by ma preceding the first verb. The relative clause follows SOV order and
it is important to note that the constituents of the relative clause cannot be
topicalised. The relative clause functions as a modifier for a head noun
that can be topicalised, but modifiers themselves (including the relative
clause as modifier) cannot be topicalised. In the examples below the
relative clauses are underlined, the head of the NP is bolded and if this NP
has a syntactic, semantic or pragmatic phrase marker it is bolded as well.
    In (69) the head of the containing NP is yier. The relative clause
mango-now ma lorok precedes it. This construction, where the relative
clause precedes the head it modifies, occurs less frequently than the
construction where the relative clause follows the head it modifies.
216      (69) Hoh    sa         sehe              non-ey, mango-now
           hoh    sa         so-h-e            non-ley mango-now

            RCM stand place LOC
            ‘So the two of them went together to the place where the
            mango trees were.’
     In (70), the noun yier ‘place’ is modified for type by the preceding
relative clause.
       (70) Ha sawk hehe             yeyk ma hawon yier

             LOC DDEM-3S.M-OBJ CAUS-go
             ‘I led the two of them to the place where canoes are moored.’
    In (71), the noun yerki ‘road’ is modified for category by the
preceding relative clause.
      (71) Sapa mon kokwe              kar ma nakanio          yerki lopa.
            sapa mon ko-kwe kar ma nak-lanio yerki lopa
            forest LOC GL.F-TOP car RCM ACC-walk road NEG
            ‘In the forest are no roads that cars can drive on.’
    Subject personal pronouns can occur within a relative clause, but are
never marked for topic. In (72), the subject personal pronoun hrom is not
marked for topic. The relative clause modifies the topicalised noun
enekwei ‘time’.
     (72) Hrom        serey        ma ley ney-ney enekwei
            hrom      so-erey      ma ley ney-ney enekwei

            sawk hakan
            CHD flee
            ‘At that time when we all went out there, one boy fled.’
     All examples of relative clauses preceding the head noun in §6.6.1 are
of locations and times. No examples have been observed where a syntactic
object or subject is preceded by a relative clause.
6.6.2 Relative clauses following the head noun
    In most cases the relative clause follows, rather than precedes, the NP
head it modifies. The relative clause comes between the head noun and
the NP marker or postposition which indicates the grammatical function of
the head.
     The order of the relative clause and the head of the NP in example (69)
is reversed in (73) where the relative clause follows the head of the NP it
modifies. The relativiser in these constructions is also ma, and, as in all
relative clauses, none of the constituents of the relative clause can be
topicalised. The relative clause functions as an embedded modifier clause
within the NP, which has its own NP marking. In the examples below the
relative clause is underlined, the head of the NP is bolded and if this NP
has a syntactic, semantic or pragmatic phrase marker it is bolded as well.
      (73) Hoh sa               sehe              non-ey, yier
             hoh sa             so-h-e            non-ley yier

             ‘So the two of them went together to the place where the
             mango trees were.’
    The postposed relative clause functions as a constituent modifying a
NP. The NP can be topicalised, but as stated before, the relative clause that
functions as a modifier cannot. In (74), the modified NP is marked by the
NP final marker seme ‘DDEM.OBJ.PL’. This marker agrees in number with
the head of the NP now-i ‘tree fruit’ it modifies.

     In (75), hopion ‘pig meat’ is the head of the NP, which agrees in
number with the final NP marker mokwe. The intervening embedded
relative clause functions as a modifier within the NP.
       (75) Homkwe hopion mein non ma loro                           neyh

             ‘They ate with fat (= ate with appetite) the meat that had been
             wrapped (into leaves) and (cooked) with stones.’
    In (76), the relative clause contains the noun aio ‘father’, which is
marked as subject of the relative clause by the subject NP marker hiy
‘3S.M.SUB’. This subject is not marked by the topic marker -kwe, as no
topic-marking with -kwe can occur within the relative clause. The NP that
is modified by the relative clause is marked by the feminine topic marker
kokwe which agrees in gender and number with the head of the NP
sa-sokruan (young woman).
      (76) Sa-sokruan        aio      hiy       ma nekie hain

‘3S.F.SUB’ and a NP object hyo makwey kokway ke (his hat). Neither
constituent can be topicalised since they are part of the embedded relative
clause. The NP is modified by the topic marker kokwe which agrees in
number and gender with the head of the NP now-kon ‘tree-branch’.
      (77) Hiykwe       now-kon       hok        hyo

    A temporal noun can also be relativised on. In (78), the antecedent
noun enekwei ‘time’ is modified by a relative clause and marked by the NP
final marker hokwe which agrees in number and gender with the head of
the NP.

6.6.3 Headless relative clauses
    The head of a relative clause is sometimes only understood but not
expressed. In (79), a clause that has the features of a relative clause,
modifies a temporal NP head that is not expressed. The meanings of (78)
220and (79) are very similar. They are also grammatically not very different.
The first part of (78) is analysed as a noun phrase containing a modifying
clause. The first part of (79) also contains a modifying clause, but the
head of the NP has been ellipted.
      (79) Hiy            wueir-a        mon ma lwayr nayr
             hiy          wueir-a        mon ma lwayr nayr

             hok         ka-lie      nayr
             3S.F.SUB side-go.up night
             ‘When he spent the night in the garden house, the devil
             woman from the swamp climbed up (to the house) during the
             night.’
    In (80), the singular phrase final marker hokwe does not correspond in
number with the plural subject hom, but with the deleted antecedent
enekwei, which is singular and masculine. Although this construction
clearly derives from a relative clause that modifies a headless relative
clause, it functions as a temporal clause which is further discussed in
§9.5.1.
      (80) Hom wueir mon ma ley hokwe,
             hom wueir mon ma ley ho-kwe
             2/3PL garden LOC RCM go GL.M-TOP
             hiykwe           now lowk e         ley kok.
             hiy-kwe          now lowk e         ley kok
             3S.M.SUB-TOP tree cut         PURP go day.time
             ‘When they went to the garden, he went to cut trees during the
             day.’
    The non-expressed antecedent for relative clauses does not always
refer to time. The meaning of the non-expressed antecedent is determined
by context and grammatical features. Examples of deleted antecedents are
generic entities such as ‘the fact that’ or ‘the thing’ or ‘the place’.
Example (81) is taken from a text where a man sits high in a tree until a
bird comes to the place where he is. The NP containing the relative clause
is marked by the locative mon, which modifies the ellipted noun for
                                                                        221location. In this context the relative clause hiy ma liwak means ‘where he
sat’ and it modifies an unexpressed noun that in the English translation
could be rendered as ‘the place’.
      (81) Enekwei kamon sawk ahney kamon hok sian
             enekwei kamon sawk ahney kamon hok sian
             time       one       CHD bird       one      3S.F fly

             ‘One day a certain bird flew to (the place) where he was
             sitting.’
    In (82), the relative clause hano makwey mon ma non-iarok kreysysar
also modifies a non-expressed NP head. The numeral kreysyar which
terminates the relative clause together with the objective demonstrative
eme indicates that the unexpressed noun is related to countable objects.
The English translation expresses the deleted antecedent as ‘the things’.
      (82) Hano makwey mon ma non-iarok kreysyar
             han-o makwey mon ma non-liarok kreys-ar
             1S-GEN head          LOC RCM DU-be.up        two.CL2-INTF

             ‘Speaking about these two (things) standing on my head, what

6.6.4 Negated relative clause
    The negation of a relative clause is slightly complex. A relative clause
is negated by the existential verb lwak preceded by the relative clause
marker ma. Three related examples below give a build-up in the
complexity of the structure of a negated relative clause. Example (83)
contains a topicalised NP that has patient role. The NP is not marked by an
object marker but only by the feminine topic marker kokwe preceding a
non-topicalised subject and the verb phrase.
222      (83) Hano sa-nawp        kokwe       makromawe hiy
           han-o sa-nawp       ko-kwe makromawe hiy
           1S-GEN woman-old GL.F-TOP iguana               3S.M.SUB

           kros       la
           tear.apart eat
           ‘As for my old woman (= wife), an iguana tore her apart.’
    In (84), the head of the noun phrase sa-nawp ‘woman-old’ is modified
by an embedded relative clause and is still marked by the same feminine
topic marker kokwe.
      (84) Hano          sa-nawp      onkioh     ma lousne
             han-o       sa-nawp      onkioh     ma lousne
             1S-GEN      woman-old yesterday RCM appear
             kokwe,     makromawe hiy kros             a.
             ko-kwe makromawe hiy kros                 la
             GL.F-TOP iguana           3S.M tear.apart eat
             ‘As for my old woman (= wife), who returned yesterday, an
             iguana tore her apart.’
     In (85), the embedded relative clause is negated. It is not possible for
the feminine topic marker kokwe to immediately follow an embedded
clause that has a negation marker. This is not surprising since the
imperfective negation marker pa is a clause marker, while the feminine
topic marker kokwe is a phrase marker. Based on the fact that the relative
clause marker ma occurs twice within the noun phrase, we need to
conclude that we have two embedded clauses within the noun phrase. The
first relative clause marker is part of the relative clause that modifies the
head of the noun phrase sa-nawp. ‘old woman’ The second relative clause
marker ma is part of the relative clause ma lwak, which has as its scope
the NP head plus the negated first relative clause. The feminine topic
marker kokwe terminates the NP and, as in the other two examples, agrees
in gender and number with the head of the NP sa-nawp ‘old woman’.

            ‘As for my old woman (= wife), who did not return yesterday,
            an iguana tore her apart.’
    In (86), the underlined embedded phrase relativises an ellipted noun
which is understood as ‘the fact that’. It is possible to negate a relative
clause that modifies an ellipted noun as is demonstrated in (87). A relative
clause consisting of the relative clause marker ma and the stative verb
lwak follows the first embedded relative clause. The second relative
clause has as its scope the same head plus the first relative clause.

            ‘I am angry with (the fact) that you did not light the fire.’
6.6.5 Adjectival clause marking simultaneous or current
action
    The adjectival clause discussed in this section is similar to the relative
clause in that the modifying clause appears between the head noun and the
NP marker which indicates the grammatical function of this head noun.
However, relative clauses are marked by the relative clause marker ma
and the adjectival clause discussed in the section does not make use of the
224marker ma, which sets this modifying clause apart from the relative
clause.
    The function of this modifying clause is not to identify a referent, but
to add extra information to an already identified referent. The verbal
action expressed in the adjectival clause takes place simultaneously with
the action of the clause it is embedded in.
    In (88), the clause hyo wayh hiy kan ke lorok ho ‘his friend was
standing and making a rope’ is an embedded adjectival clause which is not
marked by the relative clause marker ma. The adjectival clause refers to
an action that is in progress simultaneously with the action of the main
clause as indicated by the verb phrase le ira ‘came look’. The object
marker se agrees in number and gender with the head of the noun phrase
wayh ‘friend’.
      (88) Hiykwe       hyo          wayh hiy kan ke
            hiy-kwe hiy-o            wayh hiy kan k-e

            ‘He came and saw his friend, who was standing and twisting a
            ring rope (= used for climbing coconuts) at the base of a
            papaya tree.’
    In (89), the adjectival clause hiy naksaw ‘which was grunting’ is also
formed without the relative clause marker ma. The clause is therefore
analysed as indicating simultaneity in the actions of the main clause and
the adjectival clause.
      (89) Peypey pa,               hromkwe huok hiy               naksaw
             peypey pa              hrom-kwe huok hiy              nak-saw

simultaneously. When the relative clause marker ma is used in the
embedded clause simultaneity is no longer implied as is demonstrated in
(90).
      (90) Peypey pa,              hromkwe huok hiy ma
            peypey pa              hrom-kwe huok hiy ma

            ACC-grunt 3S.M-OBJ see
            ‘It did not last long and we saw the pig which had grunted.’
6.6.6 Relative clauses modifying the comment
constituent of a verbless clause
     The comment constituent of a verbless clause can be modified with a
relative clause. It requires the use of the comitative postposition non
preceded by a syntactic NP marker. In order to understand this somewhat
complex construction, it is helpful to look at some examples that do not
contain relative clauses but that display a similar noun phrase marking.
    As stated before most verbless clauses can be divided into a topic part
of often one, but possibly more topicalised constituents; and a comment
part which is basically a non-topicalised constituent which supplies a
comment on the most important topic constituent (See examples (1)-(4),
(6) and §6.2).
    It is possible, though, to state only the comment, which means that the
verbless clause has no expressed topicalised constituent, but only a non-
topicalised constituent. This often happens for titles of stories, or for short
headings that specify only the subject that will be discussed. The basic
construction of these type of clauses is as follows:
    A noun word followed by a syntactic subject NP marker which is
marked by the comitative non. The syntactic marker loses it subject force
since it is marked by the postposition non.
    In (91), the entire clause is analysed as the comment part. Therefore,
by definition, the NP marker hom ‘2/3PL’ is not topicalised. The NP marker
marks the head noun for number.
226      (91) ahney hom non
           ahney hom non
           bird    2/3PL CMT
           ‘birds’
    This same basic construction can be extended with a modifying
adjective as in (92), where seirpey ‘heroic’ modifies the head of the NP
uwr ‘man’. The clause does not contain a topic part, but only a comment
part.
      (92) uwr seirpey hiy non
            uwr seirpey hiy non
            man heroic 3S.M CMT
            ‘the heroic man’
    A clause that consists only of a comment part can contain a genitive
construction. In (93), the genitive phrase wueir ko ‘garden S.F.GEN’
modifies the head of the NP aiai ‘food. The NP marker hom ‘2/3PL’ agrees
in number with the same head of the NP.
      (93) aiai wueir ko             hom non
            aiai wueir k-o           hom non
            food garden S.F-GEN 2/3PL CMT
            ‘food from the garden’
     Like the examples above, (94) is basically a single noun phrase that
fills the topic part of the clause. The head of the noun phrase is modified
by the underlined relative clause which modifies the head of the NP aiai
‘food’.
       (94) aiai wueir ma swar hom non
              aiai wueir ma swar hom non
              food garden RCM grow 2/3PL CMT
              ‘food that grows in the garden’
    Example (95) is a story title without any topicalised constituents. The
entire utterance belongs to the comment part of the clause. The head of the
NP is nweyr ‘snail’ and is followed by a modifying relative clause. The NP
final marking hiy non hosts the masculine singular NP marker hiy which
agrees in number and gender with the singular masculine noun nweyr
‘snail’.
                                                                         227     (95) nweyr hiy iwasa ko                 a        se  ma

          lie     hiy non
          go.up 3S.M CMT
          ‘the snail who went into the shell of the crab’
     The examples so far were restricted to verbless clauses that consisted
only of a comment part and no topic part. However, the basic construction
of the examples above does not change if a topic constituent is included in
the verbless clause. The constituent in the topic slot is simply the referent
that is commented on in the comment part. The comment part of the non-
verbal clause can host only the personal pronoun with the comitative,
when the comment part marks the referent in the topic part for identity.
    The comment part in (96) consists of one NP. The NP head huwha-ma
‘flowers’ is modified by the relative clause hwon ma lopru kreik ‘which
you buried’. The NP ending hoh non agrees in number with the head of the
NP. The comment part marks the referent in the topic part hrorkwe ‘the
two of us’ in the category of identity.

             Hrorkwe huwhay-ma          hwon ma lopru kreik

             ‘The two of us are the flowers which you buried into the
             ground.’
    The comment part in (97) consists of one NP. The NP head sok ‘snake’
is modified by the relative clause hom sune iha lopa ma lwak ‘which do
not have feet and hands’. The NP ending hom non agrees in number with
the head of the NP sok ‘snake’. The comment part marks the referent of the
topic part okpey sokukwe ‘this story’ for identity.

6.6.7 Embedded attributive clauses encoding function or
intended function
     Attributive clauses that modify the head of the noun phrase for its
function or intended function are marked by ey ‘intention’. It is important
to note that this modal marker ey ‘INTN’ does not occur exclusively in
attributive clauses but also in main clauses as discussed in §5.3.2 and also
illustrated in (98).
       (98) Yaw           arawh nonaw         kokwe      hakwe
              yaw         arawh non-aw        ko-kwe ha-kwe
              tomorrow night CMT-RSTR GL.F-TOP 1S-TOP
              iwa     mon heynaw              ey.
              iwa     mon heynaw              ey
              swamp LOC hunt.with.dogs INTN
              ‘Tomorrow night I intend to hunt with the dogs in the
              swamp.’
     The clause-final intention marker ey is also widely used to mark
embedded attributive clauses that modify the head of the NP it follows.
The embedded clause marked by ey ‘INTN’ is followed by a NP final
marker of the NP it modifies. The embedded clause functions as a modifier
for the NP it is positioned in.
    In (99), the intentional marker ey indicates that the clause mu say
‘shoot crocodiles’, is an embedded attributive clause modifying the head
of the noun phrase yeik ‘arrows’. The attributive clause functions as part
of the NP and modifies the head of the NP for function or intended
function.
                                                                          229     (99) Hohkwe       yeik mu            say   ey   me

    In (100), hu lowswa ey ‘for drinking water’ is a post-head relative
clause encoding function or intended function. The masculine objective
marker se agrees in gender and number with the head of the noun phrase
yiawk ‘cup’.

    In (101), the embedded attributive clause modifies the head of the NP
ki-eyh ‘ground hole’. The NP final marker se agrees in number and gender
with the head of the noun phrase.
     (101) Har homkwe          ki-eyh         huok neyh             ey

            cooked in a ground oven)
     The attributive clause can also be placed in tail position, often without
the NP head it modifies. The attributive clause modifies the head (or the
ellipted head) of the NP.
    In (102), the attributive clause is placed in tail position. The head of
the attributive clause ai ‘fish/food’ is not positioned in the tail but in the
230main clause. The attributive clause within the tail is therefore, in fact,
without a head, but with the NP final marker mokwe that agrees in number
with the ellipted head of the NP.

marker hokuaw
    Hokuaw marks both phrases and clauses that express a reason for the
occurrence of the event in the main clause. Hokuaw is related to the
interrogative payhokuaw, which means literally ‘for reason of what’ and
was analysed as follows:
       po-ay      -ho     -kuaw
       Q-what     GL.M    CAUS (for reason of)    Characteristics of the reason construction marked by hokuaw are as
follows:
    a. It is marked by a construction final hokuaw.
    b. It can mark NPs and clauses.
    c. Topic marked NPs do not occur before the verb phrase of
         this reason clause.
    In (103) and (104) the structure marked by hokuaw is not a clause but
a noun phrase:
                                                                      231    (103) Woion hiykwe               sawk hyo          wayh Saso

          ‘Man, as for those birds, do not abstain from eating them just
          for my sake.’
   In (105), the causal marker hokuaw marks a clause that has been
nominalised by the negation marker lopa (§7.3.4).
   (105) Hrom hromo          apaw      mo        sow me        meio

           ‘Because we did not follow the rules of our ancestors, we are
           doing poorly (now).’
    In example (106), the underlined reason clause interrupts the main
clause.

            ‘The two of them did not continue to hunt, because it was
            becoming really dark in the forest.’
    Example (106) can be restructured so that the subordinate reason
clause will follow the main clause in tail position as in (107).
    (107) Hohkwe sawk ma-nak-sor                 nok pa,

      7. Clausal modifications    In the following sections five types of clause modifications which are
all marked by a clause-final marker are discussed. The first section deals
with the imperative marker e and the second section with future marker a.
It needs to be noted that these markers do not occur obligatorily in all
predications that express a command or refer to future event. The
imperative marker e can be regarded as marking jussive mood, while the
future marker a seems to be mainly used in contexts with a high level of
uncertainty. The third section deals with negation markers and the fourth
with direct speech markers. The markers in these last two sections are
differentiated for the perfective and imperfective. Interrogatives are dealt
with in the final and fifth section of this chapter.","[223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247]"
"7.5.2.1 Selective interrogatives functioning within the noun phrase
    The interrogatives in this section correspond with the demonstrative
personal subject pronouns sohiy, sohok, sohoh, sohom, and the
demonstrative object markers sehe, sokwe, seme (see Table 26). These
interrogatives ask for identification of a referent from among a closed
group.
    These interrogative forms are the only interrogatives that indicate
number and gender and which express syntactic roles. Like their
demonstrative counterparts, these interrogatives occur as NP final markers,
or occur in a NP with the head deleted. They cannot precede the noun and
never occur in the role of modifier.
    The morpheme hiy in pohiy normally indicates subject, but not when
followed by another syntactic or semantic marker. The final marker
determines NP’s case. In the table below it is shown that the set pohiy,
pohok and pohom can be followed and ruled by the genitive marker
following or by the semantic markers non ‘comitative’ or sok ‘exactness’
following.
                                                                       281                   TABLE 49: SELECTIVE INTERROGATIVES       Subject     Genitive          Object            NPs with non, sokS.M    po-hiy      po-hiy so         po-h-e            po-hiy non / sok

Ex.    (124)       (125)             (126) (127)       (128) (129)    In (124), the interrogative marker occurs NP finally, indicating the NP
functions as subject:
    (124) Hye            kokwe     uwr pohiy           ma-sahre
            hiy-e        ko-kwe uwr po-hiy             ma-sahre

            ‘Which man did answer him?’
   In (125), the genitive construction is shown. The embedded NP uwr
pohiy so modifies the head of the NP sa ‘woman’.

282    In (126), the head of the NP uru ‘name’ is modified by the selective
interrogative pehe. This interrogative belongs to the set of object
interrogatives. It is used because the questioner seeks information about a
member of a closed group:
     (126) Hai, hiykwe               uru pehe             nakinariy
             hai hiy-kwe             uru    po-h-e        nakinariy

      In (127), the NP pome has an ellipted head awia ‘enemies’.
      (127) Hai, hunkwe          awia      mokwe,      pome
              hai hwon-kwe awia            mo-kwe      po-m-e

              ‘OK, in regard to enemies, which ones do you fight against?’
     In (128), the interrogative is followed by the semantic case marker sok
in the NP enekwei pohiy sok ‘what exact time’.
     (128) Hiykwe              enekwei pohiy sok le            so?
             hiy-kwe           enekwei po-hiy sok le           so

             ‘What time exactly did he come?’
    The selective interrogative is obligatorily accompanied by the
comitative postposition non when it occurs in a verbless clause, as in
(129) and (130).
    (129) Kupe so             pen hokwe,        pohiy non
            Kupe s-o          pen ho-kwe        po-hiy non

there is no notion of ‘with’, unless we assume a non-expressed subject. In
that case example (129) can be translated: ‘As for Kupe’s pen, with which
one is he?’
     (130) Uwr prueysyar sohohkwe                  aio     so

             which one is he?’)
7.5.3 Adverbially used interrogatives
     Section 7.5.2 dealt with interrogatives that function as a NP or as a
modifying part of a NP . Five interrogatives which are used adverbially are
discussed in this section. They cannot be marked for syntax and they are
listed in Table 50. When used adverbially these interrogatives
immediately precede the verb phrase.
    Three of the five interrogative have counterparts that are adverbial
referents which indicate location, manner and measurement.

2847.5.3.1 Locative interrogative
    The basic adverbs of location are serey ‘there’ and erey ‘here’. (These
forms are derived from ley ‘go’, prefixed by the distal demonstrative so-
and the proximal demonstrative o-, resulting in sorey and orey. (The
vowel harmony rule also allows the forms serey and erey.)
    The derived location interrogative is perey ‘where’ (or the less
frequent po-erey; both forms are acceptable). In (131), the location
interrogative is used as an adverb.
     (131) Sep hiy            me,    “Hano wayh hiykwe

    The manner or contents interrogative is penkin ‘how’, derived from
po- prefixed to enkin. It is used adverbially as in (132) and (133).
    (132) Hunkwe           penkin     nan o,               hror

    The interrogative pankaw ‘to what extent’ is derived from po-ankaw
‘Q-Degree’. When used with perfective aspect, it is a request for
measurement or quantity. When used with imperfective aspect, it indicates
a polar question.
1. Measurement question
    Example (134) shows the use of pankaw in a clause ending with a
perfective speech utterance marker, indicating a request for a
measurement or quantity.
    (134) “Hai hiykwe            hyo       mey-uwr mokwe
           hai hiy-kwe           hiy-o     mey-uwr mo-kwe

           to.what.extent speak mark Q.SP.PFTV.PL hand two.CL4
           ‘“As for his workmen how many did he appoint?” “Ten.”’
     It is not obligatory that pankaw follows immediately the NP it
modifies for measurement. In (135) the subject hunkwe ‘2S.TOP’
intervenes. The determining factor is the clause-final speech marker so
that marks the clause for perfective.
     (135) “Huok-won-hu         mokwe,      hunkwe     pankaw

             ‘“Regarding the cooking oil, how many (bottles) did you
             buy?” “I bought one.”’
   In (136), the clause-final speech marker mo marks perfective aspect.
The question formed with pankaw is therefore not a polar question but a
quantity question.

            Q.SP.PFTV.PL
            ‘How many paddles do you have?’
    In (137), the topic marker mokwe which occurred in (136) has been
deleted. The noun phrase youk ‘paddle’ is separated by a pause from
pankaw. The clause is still marked by mo for perfective aspect, the
question is therefore a quantity question.
    (137) Hunkwe          youk     pankaw          mo?
             hwon-kwe youk         po-ankaw        mo

             ‘As for paddles, how many do you have?’
    Whenever pankaw occurs in a clause with perfective intonation, it
always co-occurs with a perfective speech utterance marker. No examples
of clauses with a request for measurement using the interrogative pankaw
have been observed without a speech utterance marker.
2. Polar question
    When pankaw occurs in a clause with imperfective aspect, it indicates
a polar question.
    In (138), the clause-final verb lwak ‘to be’ has imperfective aspect as
signalled by the clause intonation. The sentence is a polar question which
is not a request to give the number of workmen, but to verify or deny the
state as described in the predicate.
     (138) “Hai, hiykwe               mey-uwr kraiar non
             hai     hiy-kwe          mey-uwr kraiar non

             Q-to.what.extent be. IPFTV no
             ‘“Did he have many workmen?” “No.”’
   In (139), the interrogative pankaw precedes a VP that is marked for the
imperfective. The clause therefore constitutes a polar question.
                                                                      287    (139) “Hunkwe wueir-aiai         pankaw             hiy-a

          ‘“Did you provide (the people) with food during the day?”
          “(Yes), I provided them with food during the day.”’
3. Use of measurement and polar questions in verbless clauses
    Verbless clauses do differentiate between measurement and polar
questions in spite of the fact that verbless clauses do not differentiate
between perfective and imperfective aspect. When the interrogative
speech utterance marker is needed, only so, ko and mo are selected but
never o.
    In (140), the interrogative pankaw occurs clause-finally in a verbless
clause. There is no co-occurring speech marker. The question is
understood as a polar question.
    (140) “Hunkwe youk            pankaw?”         “Oo.”
            hwon-kwe youk         po-ankaw         oo
            2S-TOP       paddle Q-to.what.extent yes
            ‘“Do you have any paddles?” “Yes.”’
    When the interrogative speech utterance marker is added to a verbless
clause, it marks a measurement question.
    (141) “Hunkwe youk           pankaw           mo?” “Iha sirom.”
             hwon-kwe youk       po-ankaw         mo      iha    sirom
             2S-TOP      paddle Q-to.what.extent Q.PL hand one
             ‘“How many paddles do you have?” “Five.”’7.5.3.4 Reason interrogative
     The interrogative pro-word encoding reason consists of the non-
human interrogative pay ‘what’ (derived from po-ay ‘Q-what’) followed
by the pronoun hokuaw ‘for what reason?’. Hokuaw ‘for what reason?’
has as constituents: the general topical marker ho- and -kuaw ‘for reason
of’. Hokuaw is used by itself at clause level. (See for further discussion
§6.7)
288      In (142) payhokuaw is used as an adverbial phrase.
      (142) Homkwe hano           owk         kokwe
              hom-kwe han-o owk               ko-kwe

              ‘Why did you (plural) destroy my string bag?’
      In (143), it functions as the comment of a verbless sentence.
      (143) Hai, sohokwe                 payhokuaw
              hai so-ho-kwe              po-ay-ho-kuaw

              Q.SP.PFTV.M
              ‘As for that (you just said), why is it?’
    In (144), payhokuaw functions as a conjunction. It is possible that this
use of the interrogative ‘why’ as ‘because’ had been influenced by Tok
Pisin, where the interrogatives bilong wanem ‘why’ and long wanem
‘because’ are used as a reason conjunction. Although the constituents of
payhokuaw ‘because/why’ correspond closely to the constituents of Tok
Pisin long wanem ‘why’, people believe that the usage of this word is true
Abau, pre-dating the advent of Tok Pisin in the area (§9.3.3).
     (144) Hiykwe           nuw-hok, payhokuaw,

            ‘He was really afraid, because that place was very big.’7.5.3.5 Goal interrogative
    The interrogative paneke ‘why’ is possibly derived from pay-nok e ‘in
order to do what’. The following sentence is correct in some dialects of
Abau.
                                                                         289    (145) Hunkwe     paneke e       le      o?
          hwon-kwe paneke e         le      o
          2S-TOP     why      OBJ come Q.SP.IPFTV
          ‘Why did you come? (Lit. In order to do what did you
          come?)’
    The analysis above is given with some hesitation. The interrogative is
presently pronounced as paneke, while there seems to be no reason why
the first syllable was reduced from pay to pa. In light of the lack of
convincing evidence, the interrogative paneke will be simply labeled
‘why’ in the interlinear examples.
    The interrogatives payhokuaw and paneke can be interchanged in
most contexts. But some speakers make a distinction. If the above analysis
on the semantic origin of both terms is correct it suggests a distinction
between reason and (mental) goal. The former (payhokuaw) might be
used when motives and explanations are asked for, the latter (paneke)
when intentions and objectives are sought after. It has been noted that
rhetorical questions tend to be constructed with paneke, although not all
the time. This is probably not surprising since a rhetorical question
sometimes focuses on the goal and sometimes on the reason of a certain
issue. The three examples with payhokuaw above all seem to fit the
definition here, since they can all be viewed as questions regarding
background and source motive.
    Example (146) illustrates a rhetorical question. It is probably arbitrary
whether the question zooms in on the reason (for what reason) or the goal
(to what end).
     (146) Hano       ai    ey,    pa po ley sie. Hakwe yayh

 8. Structure and function of
 sentence topic and comment    Constituents within the sentence are marked or positioned in such a
way that the sentence can be easily divided in a topic part and a comment
part. Some sentences also have a third part: a phrase or clause in tail
position. The division between the topic and comment part is a prominent
feature of the language and plays an important role in the creation of
comprehensible and logical communication.
     The focal point of this chapter is to shed light on the distinctions in
relative prominence of the various phrase constituents within a sentence.
It starts with a discussion on the concept of topic (§8.1) and the overall
structure of an Abau sentence (§8.2). This is followed by a presentation of
the structure and the internal ordering of the constituents within both the
topic part (§8.3) and the comment part (§8.4) of the sentence. A
discussion about the tail position (§8.5) is also included. The chapter
concludes with discussions how constituents within the sentence can be
given less or more prominence (§8.6), how participants are tracked (§8.7),
and lastly, what features distinguish the backgrounding, foregrounding
and climax within a discourse (§8.8).","[294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305]"
"8.3.1.1 Category 1 to 5
   As stated before, topicalised noun phrases marked for syntactic or
semantic case (category 3,4,5) normally follow NPs which are only
marked pragmatically (category 1 and 2).
     In (2), the temporal NP, pokon kokwe, is only marked pragmatically
(category 1). It is followed by a NP that is both syntactically and
pragmatically marked (category 3). These two noun phrases together form
the topic slot of the sentence.

              Pokon kokwe        hano      aio  hiykwe

            ‘As for today, my father is going to make a canoe.’
    In (3), the expected order is observed: a topicalised NP only marked
pragmatically is placed before a NP marked pragmatically and
syntactically. The initial noun phrase is marked by the general masculine
topic marker, hokwe. The second NP is marked for subject and topic by
hiykwe.
                                                                      299      (3) P2(cat.1)             P1(cat.3)

           ‘As for the garden, Maika made it very well.’
     It is possible for NPs from category 1 and 2 to follow NPs from
category 3, 4 and 5. In (4), the topic part of the sentence consists of 3
topicalised noun phrases. The first and the third one are only marked
pragmatically and belong to category 1. The second NP uwr prueyn hiykwe
‘a certain man’ is marked for both subject and topic and belongs to
category 3. The NP wueir hokwe ‘garden GL.M-TOP’ is the last topic-
marked constituent that precedes the comment part of the sentence. It
therefore takes the P1 position. It is important to note that the NP has
patient role, although it is not marked as an object NP. The patient role
gives the NP more prominence. It is the most important topic that the
speaker wants to make a comment about. The focus of the sentence is the
non-topicalised constituent that precedes the verb phrase, ki sapa-ar mon
‘in the real/deep forest area’.

           ‘In the past, as for a certain man, concerning him, he made his

    Example (5) illustrates the same point. A NP that is marked
pragmatically and syntactically (hromo apaw-om homkwe) can precede a
300NP that is only marked pragmatically (sowk-yia mokwe). Again, it is
important to note that the NP in the P1 slot has patient role.

    NPs from category 5 can also function as a P1 constituent as can be
seen in (6) and (7). The first NP in (6) is marked for location by the
postpositional marked mon.

    In (7), a topicalised NP marked for subject (category 3) precedes a
topicalised postpositional noun phrase (category 5).
                                                                         301       (7) P2(cat3)   P1(cat.5)                      Comment

     In (8), the unmarked temporal peyr ‘firstly’ precedes a topicalised NP
and in (9), the unmarked temporal pokon ‘today’ precedes a topicalised
constituent. This is unusual, since all temporal noun phrases that occur in
the topic part of the clause are normally topicalised, e.g. see (11).
    In (8), the unmarked temporal peyr ‘firstly’ precedes the topicalised
subject pronoun hromkwe ‘we’. The temporal is therefore part of the topic
and is analysed as a topicalised constituent in spite of the fact that it has
no surface marking.

P1 position, and therefore the temporal constituent pokon is analysed as a
topicalised constituent, not by its marking but by its position. The speaker
might or might not pause after pokon.

    A NP with zero-marking that precedes a topicalised NP is analysed as a
constituent with special topic status. For example, in (12), yeyk ‘canoe’ is
an unmarked NP which precedes a topicalised NP. It has patient role, but is
not marked as object, nor is it marked for topic. It is separated from the
main clause by a pause. It is therefore analysed as a part of the topic, but a
topic constituent with special status.

             ‘As for canoes - we make them as follows.’
    The example above is repeated in (13), but this time yeyk ‘canoe’ is
marked by a general topic marker. There is not a significant difference in
meaning. Example (13) displays the standard formation of a topic
followed by a comment. In (12), the absence of topic marking signals that
the topic itself is more than given information and has an element of
newness.

3048.3.2 Subordinate clauses and relative clauses as topics
     Subordinate clauses occur in a sentence initially with the rare
exception of a subordinate clause placed in tail position. Subordinate
clauses are marked by various clause-final conjunctions (e.g. menkin
‘when’, ankin ‘if’, nok ‘SEQ’ etc.) or marked by clause-final topic
pronouns. Temporal and locative subordinate clauses fall into this latter
category. These subordinate clauses are actually noun phrases with an
ellipted head and an embedded relative clause (see e.g. §6.6.3).
Subordinate clauses marked by clause-final conjunctions are discussed in
§9.5, but are mentioned here since they function as topicalised
constituents that occur sentence initial.
    The subordinate clause functions as sentence topic. The main clause
always contains the comment part of the sentence. Subordinate clauses
differ from the main clause on the basis of the following criteria:
Intonational criteria:
     Only main clauses have a sharp drop in pitch at their terminus.
Subordinate clauses preceding the main clause are marked by a mid-pitch
at their terminus and bracketed from the rest of the sentence by a pause.
Subordinate clauses that follow the main clause (i.e. in the P3 position)
are bracketed by an initial pause, and are also marked by a mid-pitch at
their terminus.
Grammatical criteria:
   1. Main clauses terminate with a verb phrase (VP). Subordinate
      clauses terminate with either a NP topic marker (e.g. hokwe) or a
      clause marker (e.g. ankin ‘if’, menkin ‘when’).
   2. In main clauses, the subject or object NP can be marked by the
      topic marker -kwe. In subordinate clauses the topic marker -kwe
      can only occur at the terminus. Any subject or object within the
      subordinate clause cannot be topic-marked.
    Two subordinate clauses are displayed in (14). The initial temporal
constituent (containing an embedded clause signalled by the relative
clause marker ma) is marked by the masculine topic pronoun hokwe that
agrees in gender and number with the ellipted head enekwei ‘time’. This
temporal constituent is followed by a second temporal constituent which
is marked by the clause marker menkin ‘when’. The internal subjects
                                                                        305within both clauses (hiy and hom) are obligatorily not topic-marked by
-kwe. The subject hiykwe ‘3S.M.TOP’ is topic-marked, because it is part of
the main clause. It takes the P1 position since it precedes the comment
part of the predication.

    In (15), the second P2 constituent is an embedded clause which is
signalled by the relative clause marker ma. The embedded clause modifies
the deleted head enekwei ‘time’. The P2 constituents are marked by the
topic marker hokwe which agrees in gender and number with the ellipted
head. In these relatavised constructions no other internal topic markers are
allowed other than the constituent-final one. The noun phrase Sanow o,
nayih o, is only marked by hoh ‘2DU.SUB’ without the topic marker -kwe.
The sentence initial NP paraw-ar kokwe ‘long ago’ is analysed as a
separate P2 constituent containing background information.

8.3.3   NPs with a personal pronoun as head
    NPs that have a personal pronoun as head differ slightly from NPs that
have a noun as head. A topicalised NP with a noun as head of the NP can
be marked for both subject and topic or only for topic. A topicalised NP
with a personal pronoun as head of the NP has only the option to be
marked for the combination of subject and topic, but cannot be marked for
topic only. (See also §6.5.2)
    NPs with a noun as head of the noun phrase can be marked in three
different ways, as Table 53 illustrates, using the noun uwr ‘man’. NPs with
a personal pronoun as head of the noun phrase can be marked in only two
different ways.","[312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320]"
"2.7    Reduplicated stems
    A number of nouns, verbs and modifiers are completely reduplicated
to convey intensification: repetition, duration, increased intensity, or
plurality of participants.
    Most complete reduplications have an accepted non-reduplicated
counterpart, but not all of them, as shown in Table 13. Entries marked by
* do not occur in Abau.

    There are four major reduplication strategies. The base form is always
repeated in its complete form. The reduplicated form either follows the
base form immediately, or occurs after an inserted duplication morpheme.
The four strategies are:
    1. Reduplicated form simply duplicates the base form, e.g. me
        loh-loh ‘persuade’
    2. Reduplicated form and base form are linked by reduplication
        morpheme -a-, e.g. mei-a-mei ‘long’
    3. Reduplicated form and base form are linked by reduplication
        morpheme -pa-, e.g. me wowr-pa-wowr ‘to rebuke’
    4. Reduplicated form and base form are linked by reduplication
        morpheme -ma-, e.g. lira pe-ma-pe ‘to stare’
    All two-syllable words follow strategy 1, as shown in example (10)
     (10) me wod.na-wod.na         ‘to infuriate’
            me wa.rei-wa.rei       ‘to deny a truth’
    Table 14 illustrates that reduplication of one syllable words is not
governed by phonological rules. Examples in the left columns are
contrasted with examples that feature different types of reduplication
within a similar phonological environment. For example, all four
reduplication strategies occur in an analogous environment in the
following four compounds: kwan-a-kwan, sian-sian, nan-pa-nan,
mon-ma-mon.

 3. Nouns and noun phrases   De Vries (2005: 367) makes the point that Papuan languages
generally give the noun phrase a low priority.
        In the majority of Papuan languages the verb is the head
        of the verbal clause, and the only obligatory constituent.
        The nominals in the clause could be considered optional
        modifiers of this head… Many Papuan languages avoid
        nouns and anaphoric use of independent pronouns to an
        extreme extent in referent tracking, especially in the
        tracking of active or given subject and object referents.
    Abau does not fit this particular categorization of Papuan languages.
Clauses in Abau without a noun phrase are extremely rare. Also noun
phrases which are not overtly marked for their specific role are relatively
rare. The vast majority of noun phrases are marked for their pragmatic,
semantic or syntactic function to such an extent that the unmarked noun
phrase stands out because of its relative rareness.
     Abau has a rich inventory of markers which occur by themselves NP
finally and which contain much grammatical information. Himmelmann
(2001: 838-839) calls these syntactic noun phrase markers pronominal
articles and Tupper (2009) makes mention of the usage of similar
pronominal articles in the neighbouring Namia language.
    The vast majority of Abau noun phrases occur with a terminal phrase
marker. They can be non-syntactic pragmatic markers (§3.6 and Table
23), syntactic markers (§3.7, §3.8 and Table 28), and semantic markers
indicated by postpositions (§3.9 and Table 29). The tables referred to give
exhaustive lists of the various categories. We have analysed all the
pronominal forms listed in §3.6 through §3.9 as NP markers rather than as
a pronominal copy NP.
     Noun phrases with zero marking are relatively rare. Within a narrative
text less than 10% of the noun phrases have zero marking (see §3.11).","[44, 45, 46, 47]"
"9.1 Cohesive devices operating at sentence
and discourse level
    The three cohesion markers sawk, sa and seyr are different from all
the other connectors mentioned in this chapter. All other connectors occur
clause-initially or clause-finally. The three cohesion markers sawk, sa and
seyr however, can be found following a noun phrase within a clause. They
are different from the cohesion markers in §9.2 which basically only occur
clause-initially. The three cohesion markers can also occur in main
clauses, as well as in subordinate clauses. This is different from the
conjunctions described in §9.3 which only join main clauses and different
from the conjunctions in §9.4 which only occur in subordinate clauses in
clause-final position.
     These three cohesion markers have the same distribution, occurring
clause-initially or after a NP. The following observations can be made for
all three markers:
     a. When the cohesion marker occurs clause-initially, it takes the
         previous clause(s) into its scope. The cohesion marker relates the
                                   342
                                                                         343      clause it is part of with the previous clause for the particular type
      of cohesion the marker represents.
   b. When the cohesion marker follows a NP, it takes that NP into its
      scope. The cohesion marker relates this NP with the predication
      that follows the NP for the particular type of cohesion the marker
      represents.
    Example (1) demonstrates that conjunctions and cohesion markers are
not mutually exclusive, since a cohesion marker like sa can follow a
conjunction like menkin ‘when’.
      (1) Hiy yier kamon ko                 se         ma-le

            ‘When he had come back from a certain village, he then was
            hungry.’
9.1.1 Cohesion marker sawk as developmental marker
     The cohesion marker sawk sometimes expresses a contrastive
relationship between clauses or sentences. However, many occurrences of
sawk have been observed which cannot be translated by ‘but’. It is more
accurate to say that the cohesion marker sawk marks a change of direction
(CHD) from previously given information. Direction here is not to be
understood in a geographical sense, but as coherency in the stream of
continuing communication. The marker sawk is used when the speaker
wants to mark a change in focus in the developing stream of his
communication. The change referred to can be a major departure from the
previous communication or simply a minor adjustment in focus. The
cohesion marker sawk is analysed as a developmental marker based on the
description of Dooley and Levinsohn (2001:93):
344        Whereas connectives like and and some additives instruct
        the hearer to associate information together, some
        conjunctions convey the opposite and constrain the reader
        to move onto the next point. We will call these
        connectives developmental markers because they indicate
        that the material so marked represents a new development
        in the story or argument, as far as the author’s purpose is
        concerned.
     The cohesion marker sawk represents a new step or development in
the author’s story or argument. It takes into its scope the previous phrase
if it follows a NP, and the previous clause/sentence if it occurs clause-
initially. The predication that follows contains the change in direction that
furthers the development of the author’s story or argument.
     In (2), the first sawk occurs clause-initially and therefore takes into its
scope the preceding clause(s). The development marker sawk marks the
whole clause; it is part of as a new development within the story line. The
second sawk occurs after the NP Kupe hiykwe ‘Kupe 3S.M-TOP’ and
therefore its scope is restricted to this noun phrase. The change in
direction is a change in focus: The author marks this NP as the major
participant who will play a role in the further development of the story
line.

            ‘Father took off by canoe in the morning. He had not yet
            made it to the upstream part (of the village), but Kupe sat
            there and saw him coming. Kupe now called to him (= father)
            coming towards him (= Kupe), “Man, where are you going?”’
     As can be expected, the usage of sawk increases in frequency when
the speaker wants to convey a rapid succession of changing or dramatic
events, or when the speaker comes to the climax of his story, as in (3) and
(4). By contrast, procedural texts and descriptive texts lacking a climactic
structure often have been found without a single occurrence of sawk. (See
examples in §11.3 and §11.4.)
    Texts with action narratives evidence many occurrences of the word
sawk. In (3) and (4), the connective sawk occurs four times. The first
occurrence of sawk only takes the NP hohkwe ‘3DU-TOP’ into its scope.
The other three occurrences of sawk are clause-initial and they take the
previous clause(s) into their scope.
    It is not simple to give an adequate free translation of the four
occurrences of sawk in (3) and (4). A translation for sawk is further
complicated when it co-occurs in the same clause with the cohesion
marker sa and the adverbial causal demonstrative sehe, as in (4). The
underlined object demonstrative sehe preceding the verb phrase expresses
a logical consequence relationship (§4.4.3). The underlined marker sa
(§9.1.2) is another connective that also helps to further the development of
the story. It has a temporal function.

9.1.2 Sequential cohesion marker sa
    The cohesion marker sa indicates sequential cohesion between two
events. It encodes temporal succession. The sequencing sa expresses is
not related to contrast or change in focus or direction, but to the iconic
order of the events in the real world.
    When sa occurs after a NP, it takes this NP into its scope and
highlights its importance as participant in the subsequent action. In (5),
the connective sa is placed after the NP homkwe ‘2/3PL.TOP’. The
connective takes this NP into its scope and marks its importance as a
                                                                       347participant in the event following. The connective itself sequences the two
events mentioned in the two sentences.
       (5) Ipey-aio           homkwe     sawk kar           ley pa.
             ipey-aio         hom-kwe sawk kar              ley pa

             child 3S.M-OBJ
             ‘The parents were not happy. Then they mourned for their
             child.’
    When sa occurs clause or sentence-initially, it encodes temporal
succession.
   Example (6) contains the sequential cohesion marker sa twice. It
marks the event in the clause it is part of as subsequent to the event
mentioned in the previous clause.
      (6) Kenu hiykiaw           seyr      pa po ley, wueir

           ‘(Context: Jon had already secretly gone to Kenu’s garden)
           Kenu himself had also left for the garden. Then Jon tried -
           unsuccessfully - to take away bananas. So then Kenu himself
           came and saw the thief.’
    It is worthwhile to compare the sequential cohesion marker sa with
the clause-final sequential marker nok (§9.5.4). Whereas the cohesion
348marker sa can be used when there is a change of subject, the sequential
conjunction marker nok can only be used to describe a series of events
when there is no change of subject. The sequential marker sa is used in
two different clauses in (6) and both clauses host a subject that is different
from the previous clause. The sequential marker nok is used once to
connect two clauses which both have the same subject, though the subject
is only expressed in the first clause.
    Example (7) illustrates the same point. The conjunction marker nok
connects two clauses with the same subject. The sequential cohesion
marker sa starts a clause which has a different subject than the preceding
clause.
        (7) How hom loum menkin, ine-ih                hok or

            appeared.’
9.1.3 Addition cohesion marker seyr
     Like sawk and sa, the cohesion marker seyr occurs clause-initially or
following a NP. It expresses added or extended information, and can often
be translated in English by ‘also’ or ‘as well’. The added information is
not time oriented. It supplies more information about an already
introduced participant. This information will never contradict what was
already known.
    In (8), a town is described as having a large number of people. The
description of the town is extended. The cohesion marker seyr is followed
by the comment ki ko yeyk mokwe kraiar ‘a large number of cars’. This
does not contradict the information already given about the town, but is in
harmony with it.
                                                                           349       (8) Rabaul hokwe          yier aiopey hay, uwrsa

           GL.PL-TOP many
           ‘Rabaul is very big, there are many people. And also many
           cars.’
     In (9), the connective seyr takes the NP now hokwe (tree) it follows
into its scope. The tree was already introduced in the text. The predication
that follows the cohesion marker seyr gives additional information about
the tree.
        (9) Hom sawk now mon lokuan                      liok,   menki
              hom sawk now mon lokuan                    liok    menki

              ‘They tried without success to cross the tree to get to the other
              side. As for the tree now, it was rotten.’9.2     Clause-initial cohesive markers
    The markers in §9.2 can only occur clause-initially, with the
exception of seseyn (§9.2.3) which can occur both clause-initially and
clause-finally.
9.2.1 Projected logical consequence
    Suw occurs at the beginning of a main clause to indicate projected
logical consequence which will take place under certain future conditions
as indicated by the speaker. Suw is not used in sentences referring to the
350past. It often co-occurs with a subordinate clause marked with ankin, as is
demonstrated in (10) and (11).
      (10) Hrorkwe senkin                non-on ankin, suw yaprue-ar.
              hror-kwe so-enkin          non-lon ankin          suw yaprue-ar
              1DU-TOP DDEM-MAN DU-do if/when then good-INTF
              ‘If the two of us do it like that, then that’s good.’
      (11) Hiykwe          hreme nion noney             lopa lwak ankin,
              hiy-kwe hrom-e nion non-ley lopa lwak ankin

              suw seyr          ha-kwe liy non-ley korey
              then and/also 1S-TOP DYN DU-go NEG
              ‘If he is not going with us, then I cannot go along either.’
    The marker suw can also occur in a sentence without a conditional
subordinate clause marked by ankin. However, its use still assumes that
certain conditions will need to be met in order for the projected logical
consequence to take place.
     In (12), the action of raising a cat, has as its projected consequence
getting rid of rats.
       (12) Hunkwe        wompow me            lo      pror          kawk
             hwon-kwe wompow m-e               lo      pror          kawk

             suw hwon-o pusi hok-kwe                 hwon-e liy hiy-mon

             ‘If you want to catch and kill rats, you should first raise a cat.
             Then your cat will be able to help you.’
    One might wonder if suw is the non-topic-marked form of the deictic
set represented by sohokwe. The fact that the connective refers
anaphorically to the previous clause seems to speak in favour of this
analysis. This analysis has not been accepted though, since the
phonological shift from so to suw is hard to explain. Secondly, the fact
                                                                          351that its function is logical consequence, rather than just reference is also
somewhat puzzling.
9.2.2 Discourse cohesion markers sei and hai
     The cohesion markers sei and hai are similar in distribution. They
occur clause-initially and are often set apart by a pause from the rest of the
clause. They are also semantically very similar. Their use not only
validates the sentence or discourse that went before as true, it also views it
as completed. The function of the cohesion markers is to bring closure to
what went before and to initiate a new starting point for the evolving
discourse. Some speakers use the two markers interchangeably, although
others feel they should be distinguished. Based on the observations of the
latter group the following distinctions are noted:
     a. Sei ‘all right’ often expresses agreement to an already known or
         anticipated plan of action, while hai ‘O.K.’ may introduce or
         suggest a yet unknown or not expected plan of action.
     b. Sei is mostly used in direct speech and not in descriptive texts.
     c. Hai ‘O.K.’ is often used in questions.
     d. Hai is also often used in procedural text introducing new steps or
         activities. (Some speakers will use sei in procedural texts as well.)
    Sei ‘all right’ often expresses agreement as can be seen in (13) and
(14).

           ‘Father said, “As for today, the two of us will go hunt birds.”

    Hai occurs sentence-initially and gives special focus and importance
to the sentence it precedes. It is used in conversation to request special
attention for the statement it introduces. It is often used in questions as in
(15).
      (15) Aio        hiy mesopok, “Hai, homkwe               penkin     lon

             ‘Father asked, “OK, what did you do today?”’
    Speakers disagree on whether or not sei and hai can be used
interchangeably. Some speakers feel strongly that sei can be only used in
direct speech. They would regard the substitution of hai in (16) with the
marker sei as incorrect language use.

9.2.3 Accordance cohesion marker (seseyn)
    The cohesive marker seseyn can be paraphrased as ‘it was done as
was said’. It occurs sentence-initially and is often set apart from the rest of
the clause by a pause. This marker takes into its scope previous discourse
and relates it to the predicate following, marking this predicate in
accordance with the discourse that went before. Seseyn is always followed
by a distinctive pause. In (17), seseyn refers back to a single sentence:
      (17) Hom me,           “Har homkwe           howk ke            hrou
             hom me          har      hom-kwe howk k-e                hrou

             ‘They said, “Some should stir up the lake water in
             preparation. It was done accordingly, some men stirred up the
             lake in preparation.”’ (Context: Part of the group goes out
             before the others to start the process of stirring up poison in
             the water to kill the fish. The rest of the group joins in later
             when the poison starts to take effect.)
     In (18), seseyn occurs sentence-initially. It takes into its scope the
previous sentence, and connects it to the predication following, marking
the latter in accordance with the former.
354      (18) Hiy me,         sah-nawp     ke,        “Hunkwe anwaw

            ‘He said to his good old wife, “You lie down and sleep, I will
            watch.” It was done accordingly, his good old wife did so.’
    The cohesive marker seseyn can also occur sentence-finally in clauses
without a verb phrase. This construction is not completely similar to the
regular verbless clause, since a clause with a final seseyn does not contain
a topicalised constituent.
    The last sentence of example (18) above is shortened into a verbless
clause in (19). The cohesive marker seseyn still relates the previous
discourse with the predication it is part of. The place of the cohesion
marker has changed from clause-initial to clause-final. It occurs in a
verbless clause which could be viewed as a verbless clause with seseyn as
the comment constituent. However, the initial NP sah-nawp hok is not a
topic marked constituent. The subject pronoun hok actually requires a VP.
Therefore it might be better to anaylyse this as a clause with a deleted
verb phrase. The verb phrase can be supplied from the previous sentence
(in this case meio ‘work’) or needs to be a verb that relates preceding
discourse in agreement with the statement seseyn occurs in.
      (19) Sah-nawp hok              seseyn.
             sah-nawp    hok         seseyn
             woman-old 3S.F.SUB accordingly
            ‘His good old wife did so.’
    Example (20) demonstrates a similar construction. The marker seseyn
anaphorically refers to the preceding unit of discourse and expresses
agreement between the clause it occurs in and the preceding discourse.
Seseyn occurs clause-finally in a verbless clause hoh seseyn ‘3DU.Sub
accordingly’ which does not contain a topic marked constituent. The
subject pronoun hoh suggests that the VP has been deleted from the clause.

             ‘It was done accordingly, the two of them did so.’9.3     Coordination of clauses
    Relationships between clauses are either coordinate or subordinate.
Section §9.3 details coordinate relationships and §9.4 deals with
subordinate main clausal relationships. Subordinate clauses that are
embedded in NPs or function as a nominal complement are detailed in
§6.6. They are not included in this discussion.
   Coordination in sentences is indicated by mostly two and sometimes
more juxtaposed clauses. These clauses have a similar intonation pattern
and could be interchanged without any change in intonation pattern or
356grammatical features. The linking device between these juxtaposed
clauses is often only a pause, sometimes it is a marker, which can be
deleted. (This is in sharp contrast with the features of a subordinated
clause which has obligatory clause-final marking and exhibits a clause-
final intonation that differs greatly from the main clause’s intonation.)
    Coordinate clauses do not have a clause-final marker bound
intonationally to the clause. If a marker occurs, it is separated from the
clauses it intervenes by pauses. (The pause preceding the marker is
normally longer than the pause following.)
      Coordinate clauses are constructed as follows:
      a. Coordinate clauses which are juxtaposed with no marking
         (§9.3.1).
      b. Alternative clauses which are broken up by the intervening
         alternative marker o ‘or’ (§9.3.2).
      c. Reason clauses which are broken up by the intervening
         interrogative payhokuaw ‘why/because’ (§9.3.3).
9.3.1 Juxtaposed coordinate clauses
    In (22), the two bolded alternatives have been juxtaposed without a
conjunction as marked by Ø. It is possible to insert the alternative marker
o ‘or’ in this slot.
      (22) Hroro         ney hokwe            awia     po lo          pak,
              hror-o     ney hok-kwe          awia     po lo          pak

              ‘Our daughter, the enemy might have shot her, or, she might
              have died. The two us do not know.’
   In (23), the two bolded clauses are juxtaposed and only separated by a
pause.
     (23) Aio       hiy me,       “Ara,       hakwe hano
            aio     hiy me        ara         ha-kwe han-o

            ‘Father said, “Man, I build my own one and you build your
            own one.”’
9.3.2 Use of the alternative marker o
    Alternatives are not only expressed by juxtaposed main clauses.
Alternatives, especially when treated as a non-exhaustive list, can be an
unlimited number of main clauses, which are broken up by the intervening
marker o ‘or’.
     Example (24) was taken from a graduation speech where the speaker
explained why not everyone passed the exam. The bolded alternative
marker o ‘or’ separates the two alternatives mentioned. This marker o
occurs between the clauses and is intonationally not part of either clause.
The use of the alternative marker o in oral texts is relatively rare. Like
payhokuaw in the next section, a pause precedes and follows the marker o,
setting it apart from the two clauses it joins.
      (24) Homkwe sawk pese nan                       o,       hmo

              ‘Do not think in your heart that I cheated or that the teachers
              fouled up the exam papers or that (they) did not teach well.’
358     This marker might have become part of the language through the
influence of Tok Pisin. Its intonation pattern has no counterpart elsewhere.
The vowel is drawn out and often preceded (and sometimes even
followed) by an unusually long pause that might simply be there to give
the speaker sufficient time to formulate the next alternative.
    It is noteworthy that the alternative marker o can be added to example
(22) but not to (23). The first example can be thought of as a list that
could be added to with other possible alternatives regarding the one
referent (i.e. the daughter) discussed. The second example has two
referents (i.e. father and son) and the two alternatives given state what
each referent specifically will do. The use of the alternative marker would
be incorrect in such a context.
9.3.3 Use of payhokuaw
     There are no structural or intonational clause changes when one
relates two clauses to each other by inserting the interrogative payhokuaw
between them. This interrogative has the semantic force of ‘because’ and
is preceded and followed by a marked pause.
    In the two examples below one can simply delete the interrogative
payhokuaw ‘because’ without causing change to the intonation patterns of
each of the two clauses. The meaning of the sentence can still be
understood if the listener can make the deduction that the second clause
must express the reason for the main idea in the first clause.

    This double use of the interrogative is comparable to the Papua New
Guinean trade language, Tok Pisin, where the interrogative bilong wanem
‘why’ is also used in the meaning of both ‘why’ and ‘because’. It is not
clear if this similar use of the Abau payhokuaw is the result of exposure to
Tok Pisin, but both uses of payhokuaw are frequently observed and widely
accepted both in written and oral expression.","[356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373]"

    The following four sections deal with clause-final markers that give
modal and aspectual force to the clause. They have their own clause-final
intonation which is different from the perfective and the imperfective.
Since they indicate different aspects, one should probably not expect them
to be the same. Nevertheless some of the distinctions in the pitch over
these final markers are striking, especially the difference between the low
pitch over ley ‘inchoative’ and the relatively high pitch over ey ‘intention’.

5.3.1 Inchoative
    When the verb ley ‘go’ occurs as a motion verb it occurs at the
beginning of the verb phrase as motion verbs tend to do. The same form
ley ‘inchoative’ can also be used as a clause-final marker. In (44), both
uses are demonstrated. The verb ley ‘go’ occurs as the head of the VP and
the clause marker ley ‘INCH’. As an inchoative marker, it encodes
immediate planned action, i.e. ‘I am going to do X’.
      (44) Hakwe hano          wueir se            ma-ley ira ley.

            ‘I am going to go out to see my garden again.’
As a motion verb, ley ‘go’ marks movement away from the speaker’s
point of reference. It does not have that meaning when it functions as
clause-final modal marker. This is exemplified in (45), where ley occurs
twice: As a motion verb in the first sentence and as a modal marker in the
second sentence after le ‘come’ which is a motion verb that marks

5.3.2     Intention marker ey
    The marker ey modifies the clause for intended action. It does not give
a time indication; only intention is expressed. In (46), ey ‘intention’ marks
the clause for intended action; the temporal NP pokon-enekwei hokwe ‘this
day’ specifies the time.
      (46) Hakwe hnekwe               skul      mon hiy-ey       ey,

5.3.3 Desirability
    The VP final markers lak and ame mark clauses for potential
undesirable consequences. Lak ‘lest’ is used when the undesirable event
could potentially still take place, while ame is used when the undesirable
event did not take place because conditions for the event to take place
were not met.
   In (49), lak marks the clause that states the undesirable consequence.
The danger of the child falling is still present.
     (49) Ney sehe                       kwa nekie prosue,
            ney so-h-e                   kwa nekie prosue

            makuayk lak
            fall        lest
            ‘Take hold of that child, because it would not be good if he
            fell.’
    In contrast, ame marks a clause expressing undesirable consequences
that did not take place, since the conditions for the event to happen were
not met. It is clear from (50) that the potential event of the child falling
did not take place because a change in circumstances made falling
impossible.
                                                                        185     (50) “Hai hunkwe          paneke nekie prosue so?”

          ‘“Why did you grab and hold (him)?” “Man, because
          otherwise the child would have fallen.”’
    In (51) and (52), lak occurs as the clause marker, since the undesirable
consequences are still potentially possible.
      (51) Ara,         pokon yaprue non-aw          hin     e,
             ara        pokon yaprue non-aw          hin     e

             ‘Listen, today we should shoot well, because it would not be
             good if we had gone up and built (these bird shelters) for
             nothing.’
    The marker lak can also be used when the potential future undesirable
consequence is framed in a negated clause. In order for the negated clause
to be marked by the clause-final marker lak, the verb lwak ‘be’ needs to
be used as an auxiliary verb to the negated clause.
      (52) Ara,        hano      sawin kokwe        hunkiaw       kwa

186    In (53), the clause-final marker ame marks the clause for an undesired
consequence that did not take place since the conditions for the event to
take place were not met.

5.3.4 Modal marker pak encoding doubt
    The dubitative marker pak ‘it is not certain that’ marks propositions
for which there is a strong element of doubt. The modal marker pak marks
verbal as well as verbless clauses. In (54), pak ‘DUB’ modifies a verbless
clause.
      (54) Hiykwe        hyo         orih se           senkin
            hiy-kwe hiy-o            orih    s-e       so-enkin

            ‘He said to his father, “That might (or might not) be real

      The dubitative pak can mark a verbal clause as well, as in (55).
                                                                       187     (55) Uwr-nawp ohokwe,                 arakwon      poup po

          ‘As for that man, he may (or may not) have been torn apart
          and eaten by the devil spirit earlier today.’
    The dubitative pak can be used in a list of propositions that are all
individually marked for doubtful certainty as in (56).
      (56) Hiykwe      sa         senkin         nanpanan, “Uwr

            ‘He then thought, “As for this man, he may have been killed
            by enemies, or he may have been eaten by pigs.”’
    The dubitative marker pak can be modified by the future markers a,
ane, and aney (see §7.2).
                         6. Clause6.1     Clause types
    Abau only manifests two basic clause types. The verbless clause and
the verbal clause. Both clause types can be divided in a topic part and a
comment part. The first clause type consists of a topic constituent with a
juxtaposed comment constituent without a verb phrase or only
accompanied by the existential-stative verb lwak. The verbless clause has
two basic constituents: an optional topic constituent (although it always
needs to be understood) and an obligatory comment constituent.
    The verbal clause always has a verb phrase which is the nucleus of the
verbal clause (see §4.3). This clause type follows SOV order by default
and displays the syntactic marking of subject and object.
    The verbless clauses are discussed first (see §6.2). Then constructions
with the stative verb lwak are examined (see §6.3). These constructions
are very similar to the verbless clauses. Lastly, verbal clauses are
discussed (see §6.4).","[194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202]"
"    This model includes the verbless clause where the topic part of the
predication is taken by topicalised constituents and the comment part is
taken by a non-topicalised constituent.
     The topic constituents can be either NPs or clauses. Clauses in this
position are always marked by a topic marker or a subordinating
conjunction that takes the role of marking the subclause for topic. NPs in
this position are nearly always marked by a phrase final marker.
Exceptions to this rule are the temporal nouns pokon ‘today’ and peyr
‘firstly’ which can occur unmarked. (§8.3.1.2) Also, although rare,
unmarked NPs can occur in the topic part only set apart from the rest of
the predication by a pause. (§8.3.1.3 and also §3.11.2)

    Topicalised noun phrases, but also dependent clauses (§8.3.2), can
occur as constituents within the topic part of the sentence. The topicalised
noun phrases will be discussed first.
8.3.1   NPs with a noun as head
    In Table 52, topicalised noun phrases are divided into seven
categories based on the NP final marking:
                                                                          297         TABLE 52: TOPICALISED NPS WITH A NOUN AS HEAD OF THE NP    Type of NP marking                     Phrase final marking for NPs

 6 The temporal pokon ‘today future’       Zero marking
   and peyr ‘firstly’ are zero marked
 7 NPs with zero marking but               Marked by distinctive pause
   followed by a distinctive pause,
   separating the NP from the rest of
   the predication (§3.11)
    The first five types of NPs are placed in a graded order for the degree
of background status. Noun phrases only marked for pragmatic role
(category 1 and 2) are likely to occur first within the topic slot of the
sentence. Topicalised noun phrases marked for syntactic or semantic case
(category 3, 4, and 5) will normally follow the NPs from the first two
categories. The last two categories mentioned (6 and 7) do no occur
frequently but are mentioned for the sake of completeness.
    In general, the noun phrases in category 1 and 2 are higher in
background status than the noun phrases represented by category 3, 4 and
5. However, the decisive factor in determining the degree of background
status is not the marking but the position of the topicalised NP constituent
within the topic part of the sentence. The closer the constituent is near the
comment part of the sentence, the more it is removed from background
298status. The last topic constituent of the topic part of the sentence is the
topicalised constituent that immediately precedes the comment part of the
sentence. This constituent is analysed as the P1 constituent in Dik’s
formula. In Abau, the P1 constituent is always topicalised, and so are all
the constituents preceding it, unless they are constituents belonging to
category 6 and 7. All constituents that precede this P1 constituent are
analysed as P2 constituents, although – as stated before – the Abau P2
seems to be too heavily marked to fit Dik’s definition of the P2 or Theme
constituent.","[309, 310, 311, 312]"
"4.3.2.1 Free adverbial qualifier
    Adverbial qualifiers modify verbs. They differ from verbs in that they
cannot co-occur with the verbal prefix set. In (27), ihey ‘excellent’
modifies the verb it follows.
     (27)                                   1             2         3

            ‘The two of us spoke well (= greetings) to those boys and
            left.’
    It needs to be noted that modifiers can precede the head of the verb
phrase. However, these modifiers are not part of the verb phrase since
they do not carry the highest pitch within the clause. In (28), yaprue
‘good’ precedes the head of the verb phrase and is analysed as an
adverbial phrase (see §4.4).
142      (28)                                       1
             Aiai somokwe,              yaprue ‘nuw-ie.

             food DDEM-GL.PL-TOP good            INT-go.up
             ‘As for that food, it grows really well.’
    Unlike verbs, modifiers cannot co-occur with verbal prefixes.
Modifiers occurring inside a verb phrase modify its head, just as modifiers
that occur within the noun phrase modify its head. Modifiers that are not
part of a NP or VP modify the clause.
     Three bolded modifiers occur in (29) and illustrate the various
positions that modifiers can occur in. The first modifier iwon ‘new’ is part
of the NP and modifies the head of the NP wueir-omeme ‘garden-produce’.
The second modifier yaprue ‘good’ follows the NP and precedes the VP. It
is analysed as an adverbial phrase that modifies the clause. The last
modifier ihey ‘excellent’ is part of the VP and modifies the head of the VP
lie ‘go.up’.
      (29) Hyo           wueir-omeme iwon somokwe               yaprue
             Hiy-o       wueir-omeme iwon so-mo-kwe             yaprue

             go.up excellent
             ‘As for his new garden produce, it grew well in excellent
             fashion.’
    The number of free verbal qualifiers is rather small. Some frequently
occurring qualifiers are:
    popriy      ‘good’             lowpway         ‘completely’
    sowkriy     ‘plenty’           nonay           ‘prolonged’
    ihey        ‘excellent’        kraipakrai      ‘strongly (duplication
    liyay       ‘many’                             formed with pa ‘DUP’,
                                                   see §2.7)’
    Qualifiers are normally positioned after the last verb in the VP head. In
that position they modify all the preceding verbs. However, free qualifiers
have been observed to interrupt the sequence of verbs. In the intermediate
position the free qualifier modifies the verb it follows, not the one it
precedes.
                                                                        143    In (30), the qualifier popriy modifies the verb mon and not the next
verb sawan.

            ‘He fastened (the thing) that traps and catches birds very well
            and hung it up.’4.3.2.2 Bound qualifiers
     Many bound verbal modifiers complement the meaning of a basic
verb e.g. lira ‘see’ or me ‘speak’, mon ‘do, cause’ etc. The productivity of
this device is illustrated in Table 37 with the verb me ‘speak’. The
distribution of the bound qualifiers is very restricted and very few bound
qualifiers can be found that occur with more than one verb. The verbs me
‘speak’ and mon ‘do, cause’ both occur with a large number of bound
modifiers, but they share surprisingly few qualifiers. A few were found
like: me-sous ‘forbid’ and mon-sous ‘stop, halt’. Also a construction with
the duplicated sor ‘count, gauge’: me-sor-a-sor ‘to discuss’ mon-sor-a-sor
‘to study, practice’. Some of these constructions are only related, like:
me-piap-ma-piap ‘to defame’ and mon piapay ‘to damage’. Also,
me-wowr-pa-wowr ‘to rebuke, correct’ and mon wowr-a-wowr ‘steer’. In
the last example the qualifiers are formed by different duplication
mechanisms.

evidence supports this claim:
    1. None of the adverbial qualifiers occurring in Table 37 following
       the verb me can occur by itself verb phrase initially.
                                                                        145    2. The l-deletion rule does not apply, e.g. leior ‘deceive’, loray
        ‘promise’ and lowplowp ‘embarrass’ occur after the initial verb
        me ‘speak’, but they are not reduced to eior, oray, and owp-owp.

            b. me-loray          ‘to promise’               * me oray
            c. me-lowp-lowp ‘to embarrass someone’ * me owp-owp
4.3.3 Modifiers within the verb phrase4.3.3.1 Grammaticalised verbs
    A number of verbal constituents function at two levels. First of all
they can function as verbs. They have been analysed as such because they
can be prefixed by verbal markers and use the normal slot within the VP
that is reserved for the head of the VP. However, these verbs can also
occur as a member of the third category of verb phrase. This position
impacts the meaning and the function of the verb. For instance, in (32) the
grammaticalised verb naruok ‘wait’ is separated from the preceding verb
kekie ‘put’ by the qualifier sowkriy ‘many’. The grammaticalised verb is
part of the verb phrase, because it carries the verb phrase final intonation
contour for the perfective.

          uwr-ih  hiy  hu    hawr non-aw   sa-uh

            ‘While the husband was having a bath, the wife got all the
            food out in anticipation (of his return)’
    VPs with these verbs could be analysed as serial verb phrases, because
a qualifier intervenes between the verb in position 2 (head) and the
‘adverbial verb’. The verb has grammaticalised in these contexts. It
functions more like an auxiliary indicating a grammatical category (either
case or aspect) than as a lexical verb. The auxiliary and lexical verb
definitions for three grammaticalised verbs are given in Table 38.
146             TABLE 38: AUXILIARY AND LEXICAL DEFINITIONS FOR

Benefactive (BEN) – only         kow – event which       kow – to give
used with transitive verbs –     has an expressed (or
the stated event or action is    understood) agent

with motion verbs or other       that progresses for a   verb
action verbs to express          period of time
duration of event    Example (33) illustrates the use of lwayr ‘stay’ as an auxiliary verb
encoding continuous aspect. It is strange though, that the l-deletion rule
took place. This goes against an earlier generalisation that constituents of
the verb phrase that belong to the second and third category do not
undergo l-deletion. In spite of this reservation, the verb lwayr is analysed
as a verb that can function as a member of the first category (as a verb)
and as a member of the third category (as a grammaticalised verb).

   The verbs in Table 38 can occur together. Below kow ‘BEN’ and wayr
‘CNT’ occur together modifying the main verb kweyr ‘laugh’.

            ‘The people from the village laughed at him all the time.’
     As stated above the grammaticalised verbs lwayr, naruok and kow can
also function as verbs. The duration marker nok does not have such a
counterpart. It is only observed as a sequential marker, but it is doubtful
that the two are related, although both are concerned with the continuation
of the agent’s activity.
    In (35), both the sequential marker nok, and the duration verb nok are
used. The durative marker is part of the verb phrase (rather than a clausal
marker), because it carries the intonation contour for the imperfective.

    When these verbs occur as the initial verb in a verb sequence, they are
glossed as verbs that belong to the first category. In (36), lwayr is glossed
148as ‘stay’, and not as continuous aspect. In (37) kow is glossed as ‘give’
and naruok as ‘wait’.

    Indications of time are often expressed by NPs that display the normal
NP final marking. In (42), the noun onkioh ‘yesterday’ is marked by the
general topic marker kokwe.
     (42) Onkioh     kokwe      hakwe hno  aio

          3S.M-OBJ see
          ‘Yesterday, I saw your father.’
    There is however, a closed set of four temporal constituents that are
part of the verb phrase. These are not analysed as nouns but as adverbial
modifiers. The four members of this class are:
150        nerie   ‘morning’     4:00 AM till 10:00 AM
        kok     ‘noon’        10:00 AM till 4:00 PM
        lopay   ‘afternoon’   4:00 PM till 7:00 PM (till darkness)
        nayr    ‘night’       7:00 PM till 4:00 AM
    These four adverbial temporals relate roughly to the temporal nouns
leisnon ‘dawn/morning’, eypok ‘noon’, eyrowpwar ‘afternoon/dusk’ and
arawh ‘evening/night’. The temporal noun phrase often occurs in the
same sentence with the adverbial temporal. In (43) the temporal noun
arawh ‘evening/night’ is combined with the adverbial constituent nayr
‘night’.
      (43) Huok sohokwe                sawk arawh lei a nayr.
           huok so-ho-kwe              sawk arawh lei la nayr

           ‘As for that pig, it was slaughtered and eaten during the
           night.’
     However, temporal nouns do not have a one-to-one relation with
temporal adverbs. In (44), the NP constituent arawh ‘night’ occurs
concomitantly with the VP constituent nerie ‘morning’. This seeming
semantic mismatch enables the speaker to fine-tune the temporal setting
for an event. In (43), arawh is defined as night time only, but in (44)
arawh in combination with nerie ‘morning’ establishes the temporal
setting as the last night watch before dawn.

             ‘He went to school in the morning while it was still dark.’4.3.3.4 Evaluative markers
     Both liok ‘in vain’ and lokruok ‘repeatedly unsuccessful’ are
evaluative modals that mark the verb phrase for attempted activity without
the desired results. The adverbial liok ‘in vain’ is used when the failed
activity is attempted only one time (45); lokruok ‘repeatedly unsuccessful’
is used when the failed activity is attempted a number of times (46).
                                                                      151      (45) Hokwe       sawk woyo-hne kamon ke

    Example (47) describes the unsuccessful event of searching and

    The following sections deal with various modifiers that immediately
precede the verb phrase but are not part of the verb phrase (see also the
discussion in §4.1.1). These adverbial modifiers are analysed as adverbial
phrases and they can be divided in three different categories:
    a. Adverbial modifiers (§4.4.1).
152      b. Adverbially used demonstratives that give causal force to clauses
         they anaphorically refer to. The manner demonstrative (§4.4.2)
         and the object or causal demonstrative (§4.4.3).
      c. Adverbial interrogatives (§7.5.3). The latter group is discussed in
         chapter seven together with other types of interrogatives. The
         adverbial interrogatives function as adverbial phrases in a similar
         way to the two groups above.
      Some of the shared characteristics of these adverbial phrases are:
      a. By definition they are never topicalised.
      b. They immediately precede the VP, although modal and negation
         markers can intervene.
      c. They consist of only one word.
4.4.1 Adverbial modifiers
    Adverbial modifiers are similar in form to the adjectives discussed in
§3.5. However, an adverbial modifier can never be part of a NP but forms
an adverbial phrase by itself. The adverbial phrase immediately precedes
the verb phrase.
    Adverbial modifiers are positioned as closely as possible to the verb
phrase, but they are not constituents of the verb phrase (cf. §4.1.1). There
are only a few adverbials and they always consist of a single word.
Adverbials never host topic markers and as a logical result of their
proximity to the verb phrase, they never precede the subject or object NP.
    In (48), the adverbial modifier puraw ‘for nothing’ immediately
precedes the verb phrase.
      (48) Hromkwe wueir mokwe           puraw meio pey,
            hrom-kwe wueir mo-kwe        puraw meio pey

            PURP work
            ‘We did not make our garden for nothing, we made it to plant
            shoots in.’
    As stated above, adverbial modifiers can be separated from the VP by
intervening modal markers, examples (49) and (50), or negation markers,
example (51).
    In (49) the modal marker liy ‘DYN’ separates the adverbial puraw ‘in
vain’ from the main verb meio ‘go’.
      (49) Hakwe hano         yeyk se           puraw liy
             ha-kwe han-o yeyk s-e              puraw liy

            ‘I cannot make my canoe without having any profit of it.’
    In (50), yaprue ‘good’ is an adverb.
      (50) Aiai hiy ma saro somokwe                           yaprue
             aiai hiy ma saro so-mo-kwe                       yaprue

             3.HOR INT-go.up
             ‘As for the food he planted, just allow it to grow well.’
     In (50), yaprue ‘good’ is not part of the preceding NP. If it were an
adjectival modifier, it would have preceded the NP final marker somokwe.
It is not part of the verb phrase because the highest stress and associated
pitch within the clause is carried by nuw-ie ‘INT-go.up’. Nor can yaprue
‘good’ be a modal marker, since the clause already has a modal marker,
i.e. ka ‘hortative’. Therefore, yaprue ‘good’ is a separate adverbial that
modifies the verb phrase.
     In (51), the adverb kraiar ‘many’ is separated from the verb phrase by
the intervening prohibitive marker peie.
154      (51) Hunkwe      kraiar peie lowndiy kow o.

           ‘Do not share around liberally.’
4.4.2 Adverbial manner demonstrative
    The distal and proximal manner demonstrative senkin and enkin can
be used adjectivally (§3.5.5). The distal manner demonstrative is also
extensively used adverbially. The adverbial use of enkin is very limited as
is discussed below. When used adverbially it directly precedes the verb
phrase as an adverbial phrase that consists of only one member.
Demonstratives typically have anaphoric reference, and this is also the
case for the adverbial manner demonstratives (exceptions are discussed
below).
    Typically, senkin used adverbially (immediately preceding the VP as a
separate constituent) anaphorically refers to a previous clause or sentence.
This is shown in examples (52) and (53). The bolded manner adverbial
senkin ‘thus/in that way’ anaphorically refers to the underlined clause.

      In most cases, an adverbially used demonstrative refers anaphorically
to an understood entity. This is true for the manner demonstratives but
there are a few notable exceptions. The manner demonstrative has
cataphoric force in clauses that introduce direct speech (54) or an itemized
list (55).","[155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169]"
"8.2      Sentence structure
   Dik’s language-independent pattern-schema can be applied to the
Abau sentence structure. His basic schema is: THEME, PREDICATION,
TAIL (Dik 1980: 15).
      The same schema expressed with more detail (Dik 1980: 20)
         P2, P1 (V) S (V) O (V), P3
This can be adopted for the Abau language to: P2 , P1 S O V , P3
    The THEME is expressed by the left-dislocated P2 position and the
TAIL by the right-dislocated P3 position. The PREDICATION is everything
                                                                           293in between. In this schema, S and O stand for the neutral or unmarked
positions of Subject and Object. The V indicates the position of the verb
phrase. P1, P2, and P3 indicate special positions used for special purposes,
and the commas stand for breaks in the intonation. P1 is the clause
internal topic, the P2 position is used for elements which are left-
dislocated, i.e. they are outside the intonational boundaries of the clause
(cf. Dooley and Levinsohn 2001: 67-69) and the P3 is the right-dislocated
constituent or tail.
    Dik (1980: 16) defines THEME and TAIL as follows:
        The theme specifies the universe of discourse with respect
        to which the subsequent predication is presented as
        relevant.
        The tail is defined as an “afterthought” to the predication,
        information meant to clarify or modify it.
   Dik gives an English example that follows the schema THEME,
PREDICATION, TAIL.
      (1) Theme (P2)         Predicate (P1 S O V)    Tail (P3)
          As for my brother, he never saw her again, the poor child.
    He adds that in certain languages, constructions like this may be
strongly marked or even at the fringe of grammaticality, whereas in other
languages, they may almost represent the usual way of constructing a
sentence. He also states that the theme will very often be some term
presented in “absolute” form, i.e. without any specified semantic or
syntactic function (1980:16).
     As for the predication marked by P1 S O V, Dik (1980:20-21) states
the following:
        The positions marked by S, V and O are called “pattern
        positions” for Subj, Verb and Obj. These are the positions
        where constituents of this type end up if they have not
        been brought into P1 by the rules determining the use of
        this special initial position.
    Dik further comments about the P1 position that “either Topic or
Focus, or both will often favour the initial position in the clause, if this is
available.” In Abau, the P1 position is always a topicalised constituent and
never belongs to the comment part of the sentence.
294    Dik clearly distinguishes between the pragmatic functions of TOPIC
and FOCUS, and comments that they can be only assigned to the
constituents of the predication proper. (1980:16)
        The topic presents the entity “about” which the
        predication predicates something in the given setting.
        The focus presents what is relatively the most important
        or salient information in the given setting.
     Alternatively, and much more simply applied to Abau: topic is the
given entity the sentence is about and comment is the new information
stated about the topic. The concepts above are very helpful, since the
majority of constituents are clearly marked for topic or comment function.
The P3 (tail) position also features extensively. Furthermore, there is a
clear tendency that all constituents containing background information are
placed to the left.
     However, the formulaic distinction between P2 and the rest of the
predication is too rigid and too absolute. Constituents that could
potentially be analysed as setting the theme for the predication are indeed
left-located, but these constituents are heavily marked for the pragmatic
function of TOPIC. This contradicts Dik’s assumption that these THEME
constituents are unmarked.
    In Abau there is, however, a very sharp separation between the topic
part and the comment part of the sentence. The topic part contains
constituents that are nearly all without exception topicalised by some
marker that hosts the topic marker -kwe. In contrast, none of the
constituents within the comment part of the sentence can be topicalised.
The topic part of the sentence often contains more than one constituent
and one could make further distinctions between them in how they relate
to the rest of the clause. However, a distinction between a P2 (Theme)
constituent as different from a topic-marked P1 constituent would seem to
be artificial. It does more justice to the language to focus on the clear
dichotomy between the topic part and the comment part of the sentence.
In later discussions further distinctions between the constituents of the
topic part will be made, but not with the goal to distinguish between a P2
theme constituent and a topic-marked P1 constituent. In the examples
below constituents are labelled P2 and P1. This distinction is made on the
following basis: the last topicalised constituent within the topic part of the
clause is labelled P1; all topicalised constituents preceding P1 are labelled
                                                                        295P2. The topicalised P1 also frequently displays syntactic or semantic
marking. And even when not syntactically marked as subject or object, P1
has agent or patient function within the predication. A P2 constituent is
placed in the beginning of the clause and is overtly marked. Its relation to
the rest of the sentence seems to be more than just “specifying the
universe of discourse.” For our purposes it is best to divide the Abau
sentence in TOPIC, COMMENT, TAIL. The topic part generally consists of
P1 and P2 constituents and the comment part consists of only non-
topicalised constituents. A predication nearly always consists of a topic
part and a comment part, although it is possible that the predication only
contains a comment part if the topic part is understood. The tail is not an
obligatory part of the predication. It mostly hosts only one constituent
which may occur with or without topic marking.
    The Abau sentence can be divided into three parts: TOPIC, COMMENT,
TAIL as illustrated by Table 51.","[306, 307, 308, 309]"
"2.1 Consonant phonemes and allophonic

/r/ is a voiceless alveolar stop [t] when it precedes the alveolar fricative
[s], e.g. /uwrsa/ [օtsa] ‘people’. It is also noteworthy that in the Down-
River Dialect initial /s/ can be realised by either [s] or [t], e.g. /sa/ [sa] ~
[ta] ‘woman’. This fluctuation between [s] and [t] is not a feature of the
central dialect and is therefore not incorporated in the table above.
2.1.1 Phonetic contoid changes
    The consonants /h/, /r/ and /p/ have different phonetic representations
depending on the vowel following. In certain environments more than one
possible phonetic variation has been observed. Table 4 does not reflect
that fluctuation, but only lists the phonetic variant that is most likely to
occur.

     Abau has been analysed as having a five-vowel system. Two front,
one central and two back vowels. One could argue on the basis of
phonetics that Abau has seven vowels: three front, one central and three
back vowels. It is interesting that Laycock (1965) makes the following
footnote when he posits three front vowels and three back vowels for the
Abau language: “My impression, though it cannot be substantiated at the
moment, is that Abau /ȳ ƥ/ corresponds to Wogamusin/Iwam /e o/, and
that Abau /e o/ have developed for vowel+semivowel sequences.”
     The current analysis of the Abau language containing only two front
vowels and two back vowels is indeed based on analysing a phonetic front
vowel and a phonetic back vowel as a sequence of a vowel and
semivowel. As can be seen from Table 5, the vowels [́] and [օ] are not
analysed as separate vowel phonemes: [́] is analyzed as the phonetic
realization of the phonemes /iy/ and [օ] is analyzed as /uw/.

    Foley (1986: 52-53), citing Bailey, states that Abau has a six vowel
system. Bailey (1975: 9) posits two front vowels, one central vowel and
three back vowels. He concludes that the Abau phonemic system is
basically asymmetrical. However, research by Lock (2007) shows that
Abau has a very symmetric vowel and semi-vowel inventory. The
language also demonstrates symmetry in the way the five vowels and the
two semivowels occur together. The following contrastive features are
important for the way sequences are formed:
    the feature [ +High] divides the seven vocoids in: /i/, /u/, /w/, /y/
         versus the low vowels /e/, /a/, /o/
    the contrast between [Front] and [Back] separates /i/, /e/, /y/ from /u/,
         /o/, /w/ and leaves the central vowel /a/ in the middle, which is in
         agreement with the fact /a/ has fewer restrictions on its
         distribution than the non-central low vowels /e/ and /o/. The table
         below shows on what basis various sequences are allowed or not
         allowed.

     Bailey (1975: 33) states that “nouns exhibit lexemic tone, although
relatively few examples of contrastive lexical tone pairs have been
discovered so far”. Laycock and Z’graggen (1975: 744-5) queried the
correctness of Bailey’s claim that Abau was tonal, since it countered a
previous statement by Laycock (1965b) that Abau, Iwam and Wogamusin
are not tonal. Foley cites Bailey’s observations (1986:64). We have found
no evidence of a system of lexical tone or for the tone distinctions on
nouns and verbs that were presented by Bailey (1975: 32-37). The
minimal pairs Bailey listed all proved to be incorrect interpretations, see
Lock (2007: 21-22).
     The stress in Abau always occurs word initially. Bailey never
commented on stress. Laycock (1965b) states that stress occurs word
initially, or occurs on the second syllable when the word contains /ə/. As
stated before, the current analysis does not have this central vowel. Six of
the seven examples with /ə/ mentioned by Laycock (1965b:117) are
analysed currently as /o/. These words have the stress on the first syllable
(e.g. hohkwe ‘the two of them’). The phoneme /ə/ in the seventh word is
analysed as /ow/ (low ‘to defecate’).
    In defining the syllable we will rely on a basic phonological
assumption, that the same sequential constraints which operate at the
beginning of a word are also operative at the beginning of a syllable, even
if this syllable does not occur word initially. Similarly, the same
                                                                            21sequential constraints which operate at the end of a word should be
operative at the end of a syllable.
     The following word initial consonant clusters have been observed.
When they occur word medially, they are analysed as occurring syllable
initially.

2.4     Orthography
     In 1989, when most of the phonological analysis was done, a week
long orthography conference was organised in Yabru village which was
attended by educated and influential Abau speakers. The goal was to
determine the orthography of the Abau language on the basis of long word
lists that focused on phonemes in various environments and on particular
contrasts and minimal pairs. It also exposed the conference participants to
the various ways Abau people had spelled in testing situations. See Lock
(1993) for more information on the procedures and the reasons behind this
orthography conference.
    Based on the recommendations of this conference, the orthography
follows the phonemic analysis with two exceptions:
1. The phoneme /r/ is represented in the orthography by <r>,<l> and <d>.
The following spelling rules determine the available alternatives:
        a. Word initial /r/ is written as <l>.
           e.g. /reir/ ‘take out’ is spelled as: <leir>
        b. /r/ is written as <d> preceding /n/
           e.g. /yorney/ ‘finger’ is spelled as: <yodney>
        c. /r/ is written as <r> elsewhere.
           e.g. /hror/ ‘the two of us’ is spelled as: <hror>
2. Word initial clusters of a high vowel and a low vowel are written with
an extra word initial semi-vowel that will agree with the high vowel for
the feature [back]. Thus:
         a. /#iV/ is written as <yi>V
             e.g. /ia/ ‘fire’ is spelled as: <yia>
         b. /#uV/ is written as <wu>V
             e.g. /ueir/ ‘garden’ is spelled as: <wueir>2.5     Word boundaries and stress
     The phonological word is defined as a unit with one primary stress. In
Abau, primary stress is associated with the first syllable of the
phonological word. The syllable with primary stress is assigned higher
pitch and intensity than the other syllables. The lowest pitch occurs on the
last syllable.
                                                                             23     In example (1), syllable breaks are marked by full stops. Word initial
stress is marked by number 1 and the gradual falling tone over the
syllables by lower numbers. The numbers given only indicate the relative
pitch within each word. A syllable carrying a higher pitch than the
previous syllable always marks the onset of a new word and is therefore
marked by 1 regardless of its absolute value in terms of pitch or intensity.
In (1) the word me has a higher pitch than the final syllable ma in the
previous word and therefore me is regarded as a separate word, in spite of
the fact that its pitch is lower than the onsets of the other words in the
utterance, and even lower than the pitch on the second syllable in a.ni.ma.
        (1) '1 2 '1 2          '1 2      '1 2 3 '1         '1 2      '1
             Ha.no i.pey       ho.kwe a.ni.ma me           ya.prue la.
             my       mother 3S.F.TOP beans       OBJ.PL well        eat
             ‘My mother enjoys eating beans.’
     The distribution of the primary stress is used as a criterion for
marking word boundaries. The following rule can be formulated: A pitch-
carrying unit should be analysed as the onset of a new word, whenever
this unit carries a higher pitch than its preceding unit.
     The converse of this rule is not true. It is possible that a pitch-carrying
unit with a lower pitch than its preceding unit is the onset of a new word.
In (2), pa cannot be marked as a new word on the basis of the pitch
distribution, since pa does not carry a higher pitch than the preceding ley.
However, these two pitch-carrying units are separate words as is
demonstrated in (3).
       (2) '1 2        '1 2 '1        '1 2
             Ha.kwe sa.pa mon ley pa.
             1S.TOP forest LOC go NEG.PFTV
             ‘I did not go to the forest.’
      In (3), the verb ley is replaced by a three-syllable verb lanio. The pitch
over the unit pa is higher than the pitch over the final syllable of lanio,
thus indicating a word break. On the basis of example (3) and others like
it, the negation marker pa is given its own word status.
         (3) '1 2        '1 2 '1       '1 2 3 '1
               Ha.kwe sa.pa mon la.ni.o pa.
               1S.TOP forest LOC walk NEG.PFTV
               ‘I did not walk in the forest.’
24    The peak or highest pitch within the clause occurs on the first pitch-
carrying unit of the head of the verbal phrase. The highest pitch within a
nominal phrase occurs on the head noun.
     Word boundaries are also determined on the basis of vowel
distribution. Abau recognises two [+high] vowels (i, u) and three [-high]
vowels (e, a, o). A restriction on the distribution of the vowels is that no
sequences of low vowels are allowed. In (4), no word boundary between
lira and o can be marked on the basis of pitch difference. However, a
word boundary can be marked on the basis of vowel distribution. As ao is
disallowed in Abau, lira and o are analysed as separate words.
       (4) '1 2         '1         '1 2 '1 2 3

2.6.1 Morphophonemic changes within the verb phrase
    The following morphophonemic changes only occur within a verb or
between verbs. An initial lateral l- on a verb reduces to zero in the
following environments:
    Rule A: the verb is prefixed by a verbal prefix ending in a consonant
        or high vocoid (includes semi-vowels y and w.);
    Rule B: the verb is preceded by another verb.
    Morphophonemic Rule A is exemplified in Table 8. The verbal
prefixes listed in the first column cause the deletion of initial l-.
                                                                                          25                 TABLE 8: DELETION OF VERB-INITIAL l WHEN PREFIXED    Prefix     Meaning           Affixed to verb         Example       Meaning

    As Table 9 demonstrates, verb intial l is not deleted following a prefix
ending in the non-high central1 vowel a:
1
    Abau has no verbal prefixes ending in the mid-low vowels e and o. So it cannot be stated
    with certainty whether the non-application of the deletion rule occurs only after low
    central vowels or after all low vowels.
26      TABLE 9: NO DELETION OF VERB-INITIAL l WHEN VERBAL PREFIX ENDS IN

   Morphophonemic Rule B which applies between verbs is shown in
example (5) where the second verb liwak is reduced to iwak.
     (5) Kwa lyawriy iwak e.
           kwa lyawriy liwak e
           HOR enter       sit    OBJ
           ‘Come in and sit down.’
    The initial l- is deleted in all verbs in a serial verb construction
following the initial verb:
       (6) Hiykwe           Buna-uwrsa           me      lanio ira
            Hiy-kwe         Buna-uwr-sa          me      lanio lira

            ‘He went around visiting and talking to the Buna people.’
     The application of the deletion rule of the initial l- is restricted to
verbs and not to other parts of the verb phrase. There is only one verb in
(7). This verb lira is preceded by the dynamic modality marker liy and
followed by the negation marker ley. No deletion of initial l- takes place,
as these markers are not regarded as verbs.
       (7) Hakwe          hne       liy lira ley.

    The following morphophonemic rules are optional. They are
frequently applied but not obligatory. Both base forms and
morphophonemically derived forms exist side by side. The two optional
rules are:
    Rule C: o o e / __Ce#
    Rule D: o o a / __Ca# (in which C=consonant)
       (8) none ‘nose’ is used interchangeably with nene
            kora ‘direct speech, addressive’ is used interchangeably with
                 kara
            hrome ‘1PL.OBJ’ is used interchangeably with hreme
    In (8), hrome is derived from hrom ‘1PL.SUB’. It can take the genitive
suffix -o, or the objective suffix -e. When suffixed with the front vowel -e
the optional vowel harmony Rule C can change hrome into hreme.
    Table 10 shows the application of morphophonemic Rule C. The last
column shows the base forms and the second-last column shows the
morphophonemically derived forms.

2.6.3 Vowel harmony in kinship terms
    All kinship terms have two forms, a term of address and a term of
reference. Table 12 shows that the suffixation of kinship terms for the
terms of reference is realised by the suffixes -ih, -uh and -oh. The suffix
-eh does not occur as a counterpart of -oh. It should also be noted that
only one kinship term (hiom) exhibits the kinship suffix -oh. A quick
overview of the other kinship terms that are suffixed by -ih and -uh shows
that the choice of suffix is determined by the front feature of the last
vowel or glide within the word. When the last vowel or glide of the
kinship term exhibits the feature front, it is suffixed by -ih. In all other
cases it is suffixed by -uh.
                                                                                        29         TABLE 12: VOWEL HARMONY IN THE SUFFIXATION OF KINSHIP TERMSTerm of        Term of         Selection       Relationship

Kinship terms with different origins
ipey           pouh                            mother (also: daughter of maternal
                                               uncle)
aio            orih                            father (also: paternal uncle)
    It is interesting that the terms of address for father and mother (aio
and ipey) have a different origin than the terms of reference (orih and
pouh). The latter forms appear to have the kinship endings -ih and -uh, but
they do not have counterparts in the language without these suffixes.
Native speakers object to use a hyphen in orih or pouh, whereas they write
a hyphen before all other kinship suffixes.
    Baron (1985:10) observes that the similarity in kinship terms in the
former West Sepik (currently Sandaun) province is clearly beyond chance3
    Nay-ih is a term of reference used by both males and females for a younger same-sex-
    sibling. Hiom-oh is the term of reference used by females for brothers both younger and
    older. Ine-ih is the term used by males to refer to both younger and older sisters.
30and he posits the influence of Malay in the development of especially the
kinship terms for father and mother as one possible explanation for this
phenomenon. The Abau terms aio ‘father’ and ipey ‘mother’ are certainly
related to their Malay equivalents ayah ‘father’ and ibu ‘mother’.","[30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"
"    If a distinction exists between an intonation contour that marks the
perfective and an intonation contour that marks the imperative, then this
difference is very small. In (57) and (58) the intonation contour has been
analysed as the perfective. In combination with the sequential marker nok
and a second person subject, the examples have imperative force.

9.5.5 Counterfactual conditional
    Counterfactual conditional sentences have the following
characteristics:
    a. The conditional clause (protasis) is marked with the topic marker
        hokwe while all NPs which occur within the clause are obligatorily
        not marked for topic. (This is a normal feature of subordinate
        clauses to only have clause-final topic marking, see also §9.5.2.)
    b. The VP in the main clause (apodosis) is preceded by the perfect
        aspect marker po, encoding perfect aspect: It refers to a
        hypothetical action of which the effect would be felt in the
        present.
    c. The main clause is marked for perfective. (James (1982) notes
        that it is very common for counterfactual clauses to be expressed
        similarly to how events in the past would be expressed.)
    It is noteworthy that a counterfactual condition is only marked by the
masculine hokwe and never by the feminine kokwe, or by the plural
mokwe. Normally, the marker hokwe (along with its counterparts kokwe
and mokwe) only marks phrases (§3.6.1) and not clauses. The subordinate
clause within a counterfactual conditional sentence seems to be the
exception, although it is possible to posit that the marker hokwe
nominalises the clause.
   In (62), the underlined conditional clause has no clause-internal topic
marking. Only the clause-final hokwe is topic marked. The aspect marker
376po in combination with the perfective marked on the main clause
expresses a hypothetical event.
     (62) Homkwe hye               ok non-sawksawk me
            hom-kwe hiy-e          ok non-sawksawk me

            ‘They did not say anything back to him. If they had spoken,
            he would have shot (them).’
    The same features are illustrated in (63). The underlined conditional
clause is marked by hokwe. The main clause is marked for the perfective
and contains the aspect marker po. (The clause-initial NP (hiykwe) is
analysed as a separate constituent set apart from the conditional clause by
a pause. If it had been part of the conditional clause it would not have
been topicalised by -kwe.)
      (63) Sawk hiykwe,         nioh ley lowpway         hokwe,
            sawk hiy-kwe nioh ley lowpway                ho-kwe

            ‘As for him, if he had lost his blood completely, he would
            truly have died.’
     In light of the similarity in appearance, it is worthwhile to compare
the subordinate counterfactual clause with a temporal construction marked
by hokwe. A comparison of (64) and (65) show that both subordinate
clauses are marked by a clause-final hokwe and also that both subordinate
clauses do not have a topicalised NP. Both clauses are identical apart from
the presence of the relativiser ma in (65), which always occurs to mark an
embedded clause. In this case the modifying clause marks the deleted
head enekwei ‘time’ (see §9.5.1). Both main clauses are marked for the
imperfective, but the main clause in (64) has the modal marker po which
in this context marks the counterfactual.
                                                                      377     (64) Hom me          hokwe,     hiy        po lo    sày.

          ‘When they spoke, he shot them.’
     A subordinate counterfactual clause can contain an embedded
complement clause (see §6.7). In (66), the purpose clause hu hawr e
‘in order to wash’ precedes the verb phrase ley ‘go’.
      (66) Hunkwe,        hu      hawr e        ley hokwe,

             ‘As for you, if you had gone out to wash, you would have
             returned a long time ago.’
9.5.6 Encoding concessions
    A concession clause precedes the main clause, and is set apart from
the main clause by both a clause-initial and a clause-final pause.
   The concession clause is characterised by:
   a. an initial mo for emphasis, which can also function as a
      concession in a similar way as ‘even’ is used in English;
   b. a final hi ‘agreement’ which is a clause marker that encodes
      endorsement/agreement (§7.4.8);
   c. the absence of topic-marked NPs within the concession clause.
378      (67) Mo            hano     ney lowpwarowp hom
           mo            han-o ney lowpwarowp hom

           die      completely AGREE 1S-TOP talk NEG
           ‘Even if all my children die, I will not object.’
    A verb phrase is not required in a concession clause, as is shown in
(68):
      (68) Ara,       mo          hrom meinowon 200 Kina non
           ara        mo          hrom meinowon 200 kina non

           AGREE 1PL-TOP        car DYN ACC-carry NEG
           ‘Man, even if we had 200 Kina, we could not buy a car.’
    In (69), the concession clause is followed by the existential verb lwak
and the object marker e. The verb lwak obligatorily occurs because of the
preceding negation marker (see discussion in§7.3.4). The object marker e
is harder to explain. The object marker e can be deleted without causing
grammatical changes to the sentence. Difference in meaning between
constructions with and without the object marker e have not been
discovered.

                                                                          3799.5.7 Interrogatives used as indefinite pronouns
    A subordinate clause constructed with the help of an adverbial
interrogative preceding the verb phrase and followed by a clause-final
aspect marker can encode indefinite manner, contents or location. The
same semantic concept is expressed in English with the help of indefinite
specifiers like ‘whatever’ and ‘wherever.’
    The syntactic form of these constructions can be diagrammed as
follows:
     TABLE 55: ENCODING INDEFINITE LOCATION, MANNER AND CONTENTS   Adverbial interrogative      VP     Aspect Meaning
   (may occur singly or                marker

   perey (perey)                VP     ley        to wherever
   penkin (penkin)              VP     e          whatever (adverbial)
   pay                          VP     e          whatever (adjectival)
    The interrogatives perey and penkin can be used once in these
constructions or twice for emphasis. Example (70) would also be correct
with a single penkin and (71) would also be correct with a double perey.
      (70) Nwoh hiy            penkin     penkin     lon e, pareis
             nwoh hiy          po-enkin po-enkin lon e          pareis

             ‘Whatever the dog did, the wallaby was also with him doing
             everything along with him.’
    The difference between clause-final e and ley is related to the focus on
location (e is used) or direction (ley is used). This type of subordinate
clause is also characterised by the absence of the topic marker -kwe on the
NP preceding the verb phrase.","[387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393]"

     Above it was stated that noun incorporation is restricted to unmarked
NPs that consist of one single noun. NPs consisting of more than one
member can occur with zero marking on the NP. They are left-located and
occur even sentence initial. This left dislocation is normally reserved for
all topicalised NPs. Sentence-initial NPs with zero marking are rather rare
and therefore noteworthy.
118    In (172), the NP object hno ihey mo yeyk is separated from the rest of
the predicate by a pause which is marked by a comma.
     (172) Hno        ihey          mo      yeyk, ha          po
             hwon-o ihey            m-o     yeyk, ha          po

             ACC-carry BEN
            ‘Your plane (lit. ‘your white man’s canoe’) - I have paid for
            it.’
     A zero marked sentence-initial NP is more prominent than a sentence
initial topic-marked NP. It could be seen as a way to mark both the topic
one wants to discuss and the comment made on the topic as new
information. In the example above the option of flying home by plane was
not mentioned within the text. The introduction of the very topic was new
information as well as the comment that the ticket had already been
bought.
    The unexpected fronting of the NP signals pivotal material, crucial to
the development of the utterance argument (sometimes contrasting with
the addressee’s pre-conceptions). Even if the introduction of the topic by
means of a zero marked NP has the flavour of new information, the
subsequent comment made about the NP contains the most prominent new
information.
     Thus a zero marked left-dislocated NP is analysed as a NP that
introduces a relatively unexpected topic that still requires further
commentary. In other words: although backgrounded to the information
presented in the sentential core, a zero-marked left-located NP is much
higher on the scale of prominence than a topic-marked NP without case
marking, the default mechanism for giving background information (see
§8.6 for more on prominence). The difference between a zero marked and
a topicalised left-located NP is demonstrated by comparing the nearly
identical examples (173) and (172). The fronted NP in (172) is only
marked by a pause, the fronted NP in (173) is marked by a general topic
marker. The fronted NPs in both examples are viewed as background
information, but the NP in (172) is the more prominent of the two.
                                                                       119    (173) Hno       ihey         mo       yeyk hokwe,      ha

     Example (174) is taken from the story of the two brothers (see
appendix). When the younger brother’s shoulder is pulled from two sides,
he expresses the fear that his shoulder might be pulled off. The shoulder
was not mentioned yet and the topic hano someykyow (my shoulder) is
introduced as a new topic, which is indicated by the absence of marking
on the NP.
     (174) Ara,       hano      someykyow, pau              lon-kair
            ara       han-o someykyow pau                   lon-kair

            ‘Man, my shoulder - it is at the point of being taken out (of
            joint).’
3.11.3 Zero marking in verbless clauses or in clauses
with only a stative verb
    Lack of case marking also characterises NPs with comment function in
verbless clauses or clauses with the existential/stative verb lwak ‘be’ by
definition. The comment slot cannot be topicalised, as it contains the
information that the speaker wants to treat as new.
    In the verbless sentence (175), kaman ‘wild pig’ is an unmarked NP
with comment function.
    (175) Huok sohokwe              kaman.
          huok so-ho-kwe            kaman
          pig    DDEM-GL.M-TOP wild.pig
          ‘The pig was a wild pig.’
    Likewise in the following sentence predicated by the stative lwak ‘be’,
the comment constituent, wayh ihey-ar ‘really good friends’ is unmarked.
120      (176) Hohkwe       wayh ihey-ar            non-wak.
            hoh-kwe      wayh ihey-ar            non-lwak
            2/3DU-TOP friend excellent-INTF DU-be
            ‘The two of them were really good friends.’
3.11.4 Zero marking in constructions with senkin
   Noun phrases with the semantic role of agent or patient occur without
any syntactic, semantic or pragmatic marking when preceding the
adverbial demonstrative senkin.
    In (177), the NP paraw paraw-ar kokwe (a long time ago) fills the
topic component. The bolded NP uwr prueyn (one man) is part of the
comment component and has agent function. The adverbial demonstrative
senkin ‘DDEM-MAN’ refers forward to forthcoming discourse and its
presence requires the absence of any syntactic marking on the preceding
NP.
     (177) Paraw paraw-ar kokwe             uwr prueyn
            paraw paraw-ar ko-kwe uwr prueyn
            past     past-INTF GL.F-TOP man one
            senkin        lwayr.
            so-enkin      lwayr
            DDEM-MAN stay
            ‘A long time ago there lived a certain man like this.’
    The absence of subject marking in the example above is not due to the
use of the numeral. New participants are often introduced with the
numeral one, but the use of the numeral does not require absence of
syntactic marking. New participants can also be introduced by a NP that
hosts a syntactic marker. If that happens the adverbial demonstrative is
obligatorily absent. For example in (178), the NP uwr prueyn hiy ‘a certain
man’ introduces a new participant. The NP is marked syntactically for
subject by hiy and the adverbial demonstrative senkin is not used.
                                                                          121    (178) Sa hiy           hakan liok,       sawk uwr prueyn

          ‘He attempted in vain to run away, but a certain man stopped
          him by grabbing him and holding (his arms) tight around
          him.’
    The use of the adverbial demonstrative senkin requires the preceding
noun phrase not to have any syntactic, semantic or pragmatic marking. It
is postulated that the NP is not marked because it functions as a non-
referential item or participant, where the activity rather than the item or
participant affected by the activity is in focus. In (179), the NP huok
kamon ‘pig one’ has the function of patient in the clause, but is not
marked for object. The use of the adverbial demonstrative senkin
highlights the importance of the activity as expressed by the verb phrase
and makes the NP non-referential.
     (179) Kupe hiykwe           huok kamon senkin              hin.
              Kupe hiy-kwe huok kamon so-enkin                  hin
              Kupe 3S.M-TOP pig          one.CL2 DDEM-MAN shoot
              ‘Kupe shot a pig like this.’ Or: ‘This is how Kupe’s pig
              shooting went.’
    When the adverbial demonstrative senkin is not used, a noun phrase
with patient role, even when introduced with the numeral one, is marked
for object, as is shown in (180) where the bolded NP is marked by the
masculine object marker se.
    (180) Kupe hiykwe               huok kamon se             hin.
             Kupe hiy-kwe           huok kamon s-e            hin
             Kupe 3S.M.SUB-TOP pig       one.CL2 3S.M-OBJ shoot
            ‘Kupe shot a certain pig’
    In (181), the bolded noun phrase has the role of patient, but is not
marked for object because it is followed by the adverbial demonstrative
senkin. Again, the activity, rather than the NP with patient role is in focus.
122      (181) Hiykwe          hyo         ney-sa          senkin
            hiy-kwe         hiy-o       ney-sa          so-enkin

            CAUS-go
             ‘He took his wife and children along like this.’ Or: ‘This is
            how the leading along of his family went.’
    In (182), the bolded noun phrase has the role of patient and is marked
accordingly as object by the object marker me, since it is not followed by
the adverbial demonstrative senkin.
     (182) Hromkwe         uwr har me            hiy-ey     ey.
            hrom-kwe       uwr har      m-e      hiy-ley ey
            1PL.SUB-TOP man some PL-OBJ CAUS-go INTN
            ‘We want to take along a few men.’
     In (183), the first two forms of senkin ‘DDEM-MAN’ are used
attributively, modifying the head of the NP aiai ‘fish’. The final senkin is
used adverbially. The bolded NP has patient role but is obligatorily not
marked for object because of the following adverbial demonstrative.
     (183) Zet so              yawk          sohokwe             aiai
             Zet s-o           yawk          so-ho-kwe           aiai

  4. Verbs, verb phrases and
      adverbial phrases    This chapter deals with the non-nominal part of the clause that
basically consists of the verb phrase and the adverbial phrase. In §4.1 the
establishment of verb phrase boundaries is discussed. In §4.2 the internal
structure of verbs is dealt with. The structure of the verb phrase with its
internal modifiers is discussed in §4.3. Lastly, the adverbial phrase is
discussed in §4.4 with special attention to the adverbial use and function
of distal demonstratives.","[131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137]"
"     In (68), the first four sentences do not have a syntactically marked NP
that is part of the comment component of a predication.

    In (69), the subject NP hiy-kwe ‘3S.M-TOP’ is topicalised, but the
object NP following (hyo wueir se) is not marked for topic. The absence of
topic marking and the increase of syntactically marked NPs signals the
change from backgrounded text to foregrounded text within the discourse.

8.8.2 Foregrounding within a narrative discourse
   Foregrounded text within a discourse is marked by predications that
have syntactically marked NPs within the comment component. Non-
338topicalised subject NPs, and to even a larger extent non-topicalised object
NPs mark foregrounded sentences. A series of sentences that have very
few non-topicalised subject and object NPs are likely to be regarded as
background text.
    Examples (70) and (71) are consecutive sentences in the same text. In
(70), the first sentence contains a non-topicalised NP object (uwr
prueysyar so okpey ke), which could be a sign of foregrounded text.
However, the other two NPs in the sentence are topic-marked and one of
them is a general time reference which normally is not part of
foregrounded text.

    Examples (72) and (73) are consecutive sentences of the same text.
Example (72) contains backgrounded information. The first sentence is a
construction with the adverbial modifier senkin. The second sentence is a
verbless clause.

             ‘They also looked after a dog. The name of this dog is
            Bullet.’
    In (73), the transition is made from backgrounded information to
foregrounded information. The first sentence contains a NP marked for
subject, but it is still topicalised. The second sentence contains the non-
topicalised subject NP Bulet hiy ‘Bulet 3S.M.SUB’ which is syntactically
marked and part of the comment component of the predication. This flags
the sentence as foregrounded information.
     The marking on yokun-uwr sohokwe ‘this thief’ is noteworthy. In the
first occurrence the NP has patient role; in the second instance it has agent
role. However, the NPs are not marked for subject or object; they are only
marked by the demonstrative topic pronoun.

8.8.3 Climax
     The climax within a discourse is marked by a decrease in the number
of topicalised noun phrases and an increase in NPs that are syntactically or
semantically marked.
    In (74), the NP sok hiy ‘snake 3S.M.SUB’ refers to a new participant
within the discourse. This participant is not introduced by the numeral
one, although the insertion of the numeral would be grammatically
                                                                         341correct. In order to build the climax of the story, the new participant and
the action performed are immediately foregrounded.
      (74) How hom              loum menkin, hoh
             How hom            loum menkin hoh

             ‘When the taroes were cooked, the two of them sat down and
             ate (them). Then a snake appeared.’
    The numeral can be inserted in the last sentence of the example above.
The presence of the numeral in (75) gives more emphasis to its status as
an individual participant. Its effect is that it lessens the prominence given
to the action performed. This type of construction does not signal the
climax of a story.
      (75) Sa sok          kamon hiy                lousne.
            sa     sok     kamon hiy                lousne
            then snake one.CL2 3S.M.SUB appear
            ‘Then a certain snake appeared.’
    Three NPs are used in (76) and none of them are topicalised, but they
are all marked for subject or object. The absence of topic marking on
syntactically marked NPs signals the climax of the discourse.

        9. Complex sentences    Interclausal and intersentential relationships are the topic of this
chapter. A simple sentence consists of one clause. Complex sentences
contain two or more clauses in either coordinate (§9.3) or subordinate
(§9.4) relationship. The subordinate clause is marked by a clause-final
marker that is marked by a mid-level, i.e. non-final clause intonation.
     These clause-final markers are not the only cohesive devices within
discourse. A number of connectives or cohesion markers can occur at
different places within the clause or sentence. The placement of these
cohesion markers impacts their scope (§9.1). Some cohesion markers only
occur clause or sentence-initially and are often separated by a pause from
the rest of the clause (§9.2).","[350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356]"
"7.1     The objective marker e in imperatives
    The objective marker e occurs in imperatives that have an adhortative
flavour. The illocutionary force of the predication is not a command, but
rather an appeal. It can be used with a subject in the second person (1), but
also frequently with a subject in the first person (2) and (3). The
imperative marked by the clause-final e is used to encourage the
addressee(s) to perform a mutually agreeable action, often together with
the speaker.

7.1.1 The objective marker e used with interrogatives
    Concepts like ‘whenever’ and ‘wherever’ are expressed by repetition
of the interrogative adverbial before the verb and the object marker e
immediately following the verb phrase.
                                                                        235       (6) Nwoh hiy penkin          penkin     lon e,     pareis

           ‘Wherever he walked, he went with his dog.’7.2     Indefinite future markers a, ane and aney
    The future marker a, and the indefinite future markers ane and aney
occur clause-finally. The indefinite future markers a-ne and a-ney are
analysed as consisting of the future marker a with the morpheme -ne
‘move towards’ and -ney ‘move away’ respectively. The markers a, ane
and aney encode, with the help of interrogatives, the indefinite future.
7.2.1 The future marker a
    It is noteworthy that the future marker a occurs only in affirmative
sentences when it co-occurs with either the aspect markers po ‘IMM.FUT’
or ya ‘INDF.FUT’ (see §5.2.7 where po … a and ya ... a are analysed as
discontinuous morphemes).
    In (8), the future marker a co-occurs obligatorily with po ‘IMM.FUT’ in
an affirmative sentence to express immediate future.
        (8) Pion sohokwe               hakwe po            nak-a    a.
             pion so-ho-kwe            ha-kwe po           nak-a    a
             meat DDEM-GL.M-TOP 1S.TOP IMM.FUT ACC-eat FUT
             ‘As for that meat, I am about to eat it.’
     When a ‘FUT’ does not co-occur with the aspect markers po
‘IMM.FUT’ or ya ‘INDF.FUT’, its distribution is restricted to questions. In
(9), the future marker a is used with the interrogative penkin. (All markers
236occurring before and after the verb phrase are bolded. The verb phrase
itself is underlined.)
         (9) Ama,      hromkwe siowp          lokrue, hromkwe

              ‘Men, we are hungry, what are we going to do?’
7.2.2 The indefinite future marker ane and aney
    The indefinite future markers ane and aney also occur only in
questions. Speakers tend to interchange ane and aney when editing texts.
Both markers are used to express future uncertainty and signal some sort
of predicament. There is a tendency to use ane to describe a future
predicament that seems to have no solution available and aney to describe
a predicament for which options for a resolution can be offered. In (10)
and (11), ane is used to express the lack of options the subject has to
resolve the issue at hand.

considered to have options available to resolve the issue at hand.

            ‘As for this money, what shall I buy for it?’
    The indefinite future markers a, ane and aney can occur after the
modal marker pak ‘Dubitative’. They are used in interrogatives about
future uncertainties. The difference between pak aney and pak ane has
again to do with the level of control. When the agent has some measure of
control over future uncertainties pak aney is used (14). A low measure of
control is expressed by pak ane (15).
      (14) Hakwe Vanimo mon yerki penkin                 non ley

           ‘In what way can he go to Vanimo?’
           (Implied information: no options seem to be left)
    It is hard to determine when pak a should be used in contrast to pak
ane and pak aney. There seems to a tendency to use pak a for situations
that indicate future uncertainty which do not require immediate action to
resolve this uncertainty. This is in agreement with how ane and aney have
been analysed. Example (16) and (17) at least confirm this analysis. It
needs to be repeated though that it is hard to find unanimity among native
speakers when the three options of pak a, pak ane and pak aney are
discussed.

7.3.1 Negating verbal clauses
    The negation markers, pey and pa occur clause-finally. The marker
pey is used to negate clauses with imperfective aspect and pa is used to
negate clauses with perfective aspect. As stated before, the imperfective
often has present time reference, as can be seen in (18). It is used for the
habitual (19) and (20) and can be expected to be used whenever a general
truth, or characteristic behaviour or features are described.
                                                                         239     (18) Hakwe hye            nonkway lwak pey.

          1S-TOP 3S.M-OBJ know         be   NEG.IPFTV
          ‘I do not know him.’
Example (19) is negated by the imperfective negation marker pey, as can
be expected in a predication that expresses habitual behaviour.
     (19) Homkwe sowr-yawp-ar mon seyn mow
            hom-kwe salt-yawp-ar         mon seyn mow

            be.in.water NEG.IPFTV
            ‘They (= certain frogs) do not give birth in the ocean.’
    In (20), the speaker treats the state of ‘not looking well’ as a habitual
event that continues to be true at the present time. It is therefore marked
by the imperfective negation marker pey.
      (20) Nwoh hiykwe                owhma pownaw nuw-wâk.
             nwoh hiy-kwe             owhma pownaw nuw-lwak

             ‘The dog was very hairy. He was not good-looking.’
    In (21), the speaker treats the negated predicate as a state of affairs
that started in the past and continues to have relevance in the present. The
speaker uses, therefore, the imperfective negation marker pey.
      (21) Uwr hokwe            pruam-oiow-aw             lwak, hiykwe

              As for pigs, he never shoots one.’
240    The negation marker pa is used to negate clauses with perfective
aspect. As stated before, the perfective often has past time reference.
     (22) Enekwei sehiy               non hakwe hano            sa

            ‘Well, when (he) saw that, he was not very happy.’
    A sentence with an imperfective negation marker can be followed by
a sentence with a perfective negation markers, as can be seen in (24).

            ‘The dog was very hairy. He was not good-looking. The dog
            himself did not know it.’
    The first negation marker pey marks the state of affairs as a habitual
state or a general truth. The subject is not expressed in the first sentence,
but the imperfective negation marker allows the subject to be chosen from
a wide selection of possible agents, unrestricted by time. The narrator
could have used the perfective marker pa, but then the implied subject can
only be sought in the context of the story which includes the given time
frame of the story. The change of pey to pa would necessitate an
                                                                        241adaptation of the free translation, e.g. ‘no one considered him good-
looking’.
    The second sentence is treated by the narrator as an event that is
placed in the past. It is therefore marked by the perfective negation marker
pa.
7.3.2 Negating verbless clauses
    The negation markers pey and pa can be used only after a VP. In order
to negate a verbless clause the negation marker lopa is used. In a verbless
clause it is used to express the absence of ownership as in (25) and (26).
      (25) Hiykwe        yeyk lopa.
              hiy-kwe yeyk lopa
              3S.M-TOP canoe NEG.NOMS
              ‘He does not have a canoe.’
      (26) Hano        aio     hiykwe      mein-owon             lopa.
              han-o aio        hiy-kwe mein-owon                 lopa
              1S-GEN father 3S.M-TOP stone-half(=money) NEG.NOMS
              ‘My father does not have any money.’
    If one wants to negate ownership one uses lopa, if one wants to negate
characteristics one uses clause-final korey.
      (27) Hiykwe        uwr-ar      korey.
             hiy-kwe uwr-ar          korey
             3S.M-TOP man-INTF NEG
             ‘He is not a real man.’
      (28) Wawp mo             pion mo-kwe        aiopey korey.
             wawp m-o          pion mo-kwe        aiopey korey
             crane PL-GEN meat GL.PL-TOP big              NEG
             ‘The meat of the crane bird is not very much.’
    A second way to negate a verbless clause is to use the negation speech
utterance markers. The negator korey can be replaced by the negation
speech utterance marker sō. (Use of the diacritics is explained in §7.4.1)
    The negation speech utterance marker expresses more emphasis than
the negator korey, as is shown in (29) and (30).
242      (29) Hunkwe      uwr-ar      korey.
           hwon-kwe uwr-ar         korey
           2S.M-TOP man-INTF NEG
           ‘You are not a real man.’
      (30) Hunkwe      uwr-ar      sō.
           hwon-kwe uwr-ar         so
           2S.M-TOP man-INTF NEG.SP.PFTV.M
           ‘You are absolutely not a real man.’
    Speech utterance markers do not signal only emphatic negation, but
also interrogation and emphatic declaration, depending on the intonation
over the speech utterance marker (§7.4). The emphatic negation markers
were highlighted here so as to keep the topic negation together in the
analysis.
7.3.3 Additional functions of negator korey
    Korey also functions as negator of an entire discourse segment,
occurring immediately following the segment.
     (31) “Hunkwe sapa mon wayr nayr so?”
            hwon-kwe sapa mon lwayr nayr so
            2S-TOP      forest LOC stay night Q.SP.PFTV.M
            “Korey.”
            korey
           NEG
           ‘“Did you spend the night in the forest?” “No.”’
    Korey marks emphasis when it is used in combination with one of the
clause-final negation markers pey or pa. The negation word korey occurs
before the verb phrase, as illustrated in examples (32-34).
      (32) Hakwe hye               korey lira pa.
             ha-kwe hiy-e          korey lira pa

          ‘As for those children, they do not have any sicknesses and
          they certainly will not die.’
7.3.4 The negation marker lopa
    Example (35) demonstrates the most frequent use of the negator lopa,
where it follows a nominal and indicates non-possession. It negates the NP
aiai-yok ‘seedlings’.
      (35) Uwr aiai-yok          lopa lwak ankin, wueir liy
             uwr aiai-yok        lopa lwak ankin        wueir liy
             man food-shoot NEG be           if/when garden DYN
             meio ley.
             meio korey
             work NEG
             ‘If a man does not have any seedlings, he cannot work a
             garden.’
    A NP marked by the negation marker lopa has the opposite meaning
of a NP marked with the comitative marker non. It is the contrast between
non-possession and possession. Compare (35) and (36).
      (36) Uwr aiai-yok        non lwak ankin, wueir liy meio.
           uwr aiai-yok        non lwak ankin        wueir liy meio
           man food-shoot CMT be           if/when garden DYN work
           ‘If a man has seedlings, he can work a garden.’
244    The negation marker lopa normally marks only nominals indicating
non-possession. It also immediately follows the nominal. The negators
pey and pa (§7.3.1) are used to negate verbal clauses as is demonstrated in
(37).
      (37) Hiykwe       sapa mon nakey           sawk hiykwe
            hiy-kwe sapa mon nak-ley sawk hiy-kwe
            3S.M-TOP forest LOC ACC-go CHD 3S.M-TOP
            huok hin       pa.
            huok hin       lopa
            pig    shoot NEG.PFTV
            ‘He went into the forest, but he did not shoot a pig.’
    Although not very frequent, the negator lopa can follow a verb, as in
(38), and in doing so it nominalises the clause as an event that never took
place. The noun huok ‘pig’ and the verb hin ‘shoot’ form together the
nominal construction of ‘pig shooting’.
      (38) Keno hiykwe         nyo warkiayr. Hiykwe           huok
             Keno hiy-kwe nyo warkiayr             hiy-kwe huok
             Keno 3S.M-TOP lad young.man 3S.M-TOP pig
             hin    lopa.
             hin    lopa
             shoot NEG.NOMS
             ‘Keno was a young lad. He never had (the experience) of
             shooting a pig.’
    The negator lopa in (39) negates the nominalised construction kuey la
‘grub-eating’. By using the negator lopa ‘NEG.NOMS’, which is used for
nominal constructions, rather than the valid alternative of the verbal
negator pey ‘NEG. IPFTV’, the speaker emphasises the absolute non-
occurrence of the event over an extended period of time.
     (39) Sawk hunkwe           senkin         lon pa           lwak
            sawk hwon-kwe s-enkin              lon pa           lwak

            ‘But if you do not do so, then there is never any grub-eating.’
                                                                        2457.3.5 Negation markers in subordinate clauses
    The imperfective negation marker pey is not used in a subordinate
clause, but the perfective negation marker pa and the nominalising
negator lopa are both used. The latter might be preferred when the
complete absence of the negated activity is the focus, but the semantic
difference between the use of pa or lopa in subordinate clauses is very
small. Both negators seem to be quite interchangeable within subordinate
clauses.
     When a negation marker occurs in a subordinate clause, it needs to be
followed by the stative verb lwak ‘to be’ to form a grammatically correct
sentence.
    In (40), the negator lopa occurs within a subordinate clause marked
by ankin ‘if’. The negator lopa is obligatorily followed by the stative verb
lwak.
      (40) Ey hiy              lo     lopa         lwak ankin,
             ey hiy            lo     lopa         lwak ankin
             sun 3S.M.SUB shine NEG.NOMS be               if
             now homkwe          aiai liy leip ley.

             tree 2/3PL-TOP food DYN bear NEG
             ‘If the sun never shines, the trees would not bear any fruit.’
     The perfective negation marker pa can also be used within a
subordinate clause, as is demonstrated in (41). The stative verb lwak is
still obligatorily present. In (41), the verb hawr ‘wash’ is followed by the
perfective negation marker pa.
       (41) Hromkwe           hu      hawr pa          lwak ankin,
              hrom-kwe        hu      hawr lopa        lwak ankin

              ill   some 1PL-GEN body LOC DYN appear
              ‘If we don’t wash, some sicknesses will appear in our body.’
   Example (42) demonstrates the same use of the negator lopa in
combination with the stative verb lwak in a subordinate clause.
246      (42) Hunkwe       mey meio lopa              lwak ankin,
           hwon-kwe mey meio lopa                  lwak ankin

           1S-TOP gladness DYN go NEG
           ‘If you never do your work, I will not be happy.’
7.3.6 Prohibitive
    The markers pese …o obligatorily bracket the VP of the clause to
encode the prohibitive. The prohibitive marker pese seems to be
interchangeable with peie. No differences in use and meaning have been
discovered. Both markers always co-occur with the speech marker o that
follows the verb phrase immediately.
    The marker pese (or peie) always immediately precedes the VP. The
clause-final o is analysed as a direct speech marker that marks emphasis.
Clause-final o can mark negation (see §7.4.2), but based on the low pitch
over the vowel the marker is analysed as an emphatic marker.
   In (43-45), the markers pese … o embrace the VP. The scope of
negation covers all the constituents of the underlined VP.
     (43) Hunkwe          nwoh kow-a ankin, hye               kokwe

    In (44), the scope of negation includes the adverbial modifiers on the
verb.
                                                                       247     (44) Hunkwe       yeyk se            pese meio lowpway

interchangeably to negate the imperative.

            ‘Do not eat without sharing (lit. without hands).’
7.3.7 Negating dynamic modality
    Negated dynamic modality is marked by the combination of the
dynamic modal marker liy which precedes the verb phrase, and the
negation marker ley which immediately follows the verb phrase. The last
marker should not be confused with the two homophonous forms ley ‘go’
and ley ‘inchoative’. When clause-final ley co-occurs with liy ‘DYN’ it
negates dynamic modality. It is assumed that ley in this context is a
variant of korey ‘NEG’.
      (47) Hakwe yeyk se                    liy meio ley.

             ‘I am not able / I should not / I am not available to make the

capability (49), and appropriateness (50).

7.3.8 Continued negation of an activity or state
    When one wants to express that a certain state or activity ceased to
exist and will continue to be in this ceased state for the indefinite future,
the negation marker pase NEG.CNT is used in combination with a clause-
final object marker e. The negation construction is best translated in
English by ‘not anymore’.
     This negation is not used in the imperative mood like the prohibitive,
but is utilized in the indicative mood. The negation marker pase … e has
as its focus a continuing negated state of affairs. In (51), it expresses the
notion that a certain action that was part of the past will not happen in the
future anymore.
                                                                      249     (51) Sehiy          so         meyki sok sawk hehe

continue.

            husband did not work on planting his tapioc garden any

    The negation construction pase …e does not only negate one single
event taking place at one time, but it has an extended time as its scope.
The context of (54) supports this, since the marker lokruok refers to many
unsuccessful attempts (§4.3.3.4) and the negation construction pase … e
also refers to an extended time.

7.3.9 Negative indefinites
     Concepts like nothing (55), no-one (56), no way (57) nowhere (58)
etc. are expressed by the combination of an interrogative and a verb
phrase final ley. Resulting sentences are viewed by native speakers as
statements and not as questions. The interrogative precedes the verb
phrase either as an adverbial interrogative (ex. 56) or as part of a NP
(ex. 55). The verb phrase is immediately followed by a clause-final ley
that is analysed as a variant of korey ‘NEG’ (see §7.3.7 for a comparable
analysis of the dynamic modality negation liy … ley).

     Sentence final speech utterance markers modify a sentence for the
following three categories: interrogative, emphatic negation and emphatic
declarative. They are a feature of spoken language in direct interaction.
These markers are only used when something needs to be asked or
emphatically be declared or negated. The set of speech utterance markers
consists of the imperfective speech utterance marker o and the perfective
speech utterance markers so, ko and mo. The same set of imperfective and
perfective speech utterance markers mark the three mentioned categories.
The markers only differ in the intonation contour they carry. Specifics for
the three categories are given in Table 44.
    The imperfective speech marker o and the perfective speech markers
so, ko and mo occur with the following differing intonations that
determine whether they mark the sentence for interrogative, emphatic
negation or emphatic declarative. (These diacritics are only used in this
grammar write-up but not in the currently accepted orthography.)

 declarative                     and level                  level
In the sections below more detail is given about the intonation of the
various markers.
    These markers have some resemblance in form to the proximal and
distal demonstratives and also to the genitive markers. The proximal
demonstrative is represented by o- (§3.6.2) and so are the imperfective
speech utterance markers. The imperfective often has present tense
reference. This is consistent with the pattern in many languages where
proximal signals cataphoric reference and more distant signals anaphoric
reference (e.g. the table at Dixon 2003:83). However, the perfective
speech utterance markers so, ko and mo do not really match the distal
demonstrative. It should be noted that they are identical in form to the
three genitive markers. They function at different levels though, one
marking embedded noun phrases and the other clauses or even sentences.
     A speech utterance is not obligatorily marked with any of the markers
listed in Table 44. Many utterances like (59) can be made that have no
sentence final speech marker.
      (59) Aio      hiy me,         “Hakwe siowp         lokrue.”
            aio     hiy me          ha-kwe siowp         lokrue
            father 3S.M speak 1S-TOP intestines die
            ‘Father said, “I am hungry.”’
    The interrogative, however, is nearly always marked with a sentence
final speech utterance marker. The use of the interrogative speech marker
is sometimes left out when an adverbial interrogative marker (§7.5.3) is
                                                                      253used in combination with the inchoative marker ley (§5.3.1) and the
intentional marker ey (§5.3.2). This is demonstrated in (60) and (61).
      (60) Naw mokwe,           hromkwe pay          non lowk
             naw mo-kwe         hrom-kwe po-ay non lowk

            ‘How will the garden be / What will the garden be like?’
    The modal markers ley ‘INCH’ and ey ‘INTN’ can occur with a clause-
final speech utterance marker. See examples (85) and (86).
7.4.1 Use of the perfective speech markers so, ko and
mo
    The same speech markers are used in verbal and verbless clauses. In
the latter case only the perfective speech utterance markers can be used
and never the imperfective speech marker o. The perfective speech marker
immediately follows the comment constituent of a verbless clause.
   The following perfective (PFTV) speech utterance markers (SP) are
          recognised:
   so ‘SP.PFTV.M’
   ko ‘SP.PFTV.F’
   mo ‘SP.PFTV.PL’
    The emphatic negation speech marker (sō, kō or mō) is used in short
verbless constructions. Examples (62), (63) and (64) show agreement in
number and gender between the speech utterance marker and the head of
the NP it follows.
254      (62) Hano a            sō.
           han-o a           so
           1S-GEN house NEG.SP.PFTV.M
           ‘This is not my house.’
      (63) Sa        sokukwe            hano     ipey   kō.
           sa        so-ko-kwe          han-o ipey      ko
           woman DDEM-GL.F-TOP 1S-GEN mother NEG.SP.PFTV.F
           ‘As for that woman, she is not my mother.’
      (64) Huok somokwe,               hno      huok mō.

           pig     DDEM-GL.PL-TOP 2S-GEN pig          NEG.SP.PFTV.PL
           ‘As for those pigs, they are not yours.’
    As stated before (§7.3.2), the speech markers sō, kō and mō in (62-64)
can all be replaced by korey which has less emphasis.
    The speech utterance markers have different modal force depending
on the intonation used: interrogative (Q), emphatic negation (NEG) and
emphatic declarative (EMPH).
    Interrogative: The intonation over the speech marker is a glide
        shifting from mid-level to low.
    Emphatic negation: The intonation over the speech marker is a non-
        changing pitch at mid level.
    Emphatic declarative: The intonation over the speech marker is a
        non-changing pitch at low level.
Neutral declarative     Hano a.       ‘This is my house.’
Interrogative           Hano a sõ?    ‘Is this my house?’
Emphatic negation       Hano a sō.    ‘This is (certainly) not my house.’
Emphatic declarative    Hano a sö.    ‘This is (certainly) my house.’
    As stated above: direct speech is not obligatorily marked by the
markers so, ko and mo. A declarative verbless clause can be formed
without any of these markers present, as can be seen in example (65).
     (65) Sa          sokukwe           hano     ipey.
            sa        so-ko-kwe         han-o ipey

level falling to low.
      (66) Sa          sokukwe          hano    ipey     kõ?
             sa        so-ko-kwe        han-o ipey       ko
             woman DDEM-GL.F-TOP 1S-GEN mother Q.SP.PFTV.F
             ‘As for that woman, is she my mother?’
    The perfective emphatic negation speech marker ko exhibits a non-
changing pitch at mid level.
     (67) Sa          sokukwe           hano     ipey     kō!
            sa        so-ko-kwe         han-o ipey        ko
            woman DDEM-GL.F-TOP 1S-GEN mother NEG.SP.PFTV.F
            ‘As for that woman, she is (certainly) not my mother!’
    The perfective emphatic declarative speech marker ko exhibits a non-
changing pitch at low level.
     (68) Sa          sokukwe          hano       ipey   kö.
            sa        so-ko-kwe        han-o ipey        ko
            woman DDEM-GL.F-TOP 1S-GEN mother EMPH.SP.PFTV.F
            ‘As for that woman, she (certainly) is my mother.’
     The examples above deal with verbless clauses, but the same
distinctions between interrogative, negation and emphatic declarative can
be made in verbal clauses as is demonstrated in the three examples below.
    The intonation contour as given in Table 44 distinguishes between
interrogative (69), emphatic negation (70) and emphatic declarative (71).

           OBJ<SUB EMPH.SP.PFTV.M
           ‘A centipede bit me in my big toe.’
    The perfective speech marker agrees in number and gender with a NP
within the sentence it modifies. In general that is the object NP. When no
object NP occurs, it agrees with the subject NP. See for more discussion
§7.4.4.
7.4.2 Usage of imperfective speech marker o
    The imperfective speech marker, which overlaps with the present,
habitual and future is not differentiated for gender and number. Like the
perfective speech markers it exhibits various intonation contours that can
give the clause the modal force of emphatic negation, interrogative, or
emphatic affirmative. This marker can only be used in verbal sentences.
    The intonation contour for the imperfective speech markers for these
three categories is not identical to the intonation contour for the perfective
speech markers. The perfective and imperfective markers agree for the
features of level pitch and falling pitch. The major difference is the pitch
height. The intonation contour for the imperfective exhibits for all three
categories a higher onset. E.g. the glide over the interrogative o starts and
ends at a higher pitch than the glide over the interrogative speech markers
so, ko and mo. The markers for the emphatic negation and the emphatic
declarative have a level intonation contour. The relative pitch height for
the imperfective is higher than for the corresponding imperfective
markers. In an attempt not to overload the examples with too many
diacritics I have not marked this difference in pitch height between the
perfective and imperfective.
   The intonation contour associated with sentences encoding the
imperfective speech markers distinguishes the interrogative (72), the
negative (73), and the emphatic declarative (74).
    In (72), the imperfective interrogative speech utterance marker o
exhibits a glide that starts at a high level falling to mid.

marker).

    The imperfective emphatic declarative speech marker ko in (74)

indicate that it is a higher pitch than the corresponding perfective
emphatic declarative speech marker).

2587.4.3 Observed usage of the speech markers
    Apart from the interrogative speech marker, speech utterance markers
are not used extensively, since there are other devices to make declarative
sentences or to negate predications.
     The emphatic declarative is used to either contradict a possible
alternative or to stress the truth value of newly given information. The
device is available but many declarative statements can be made without
using this speech utterance marker.
Example (74) appears with a sentence final emphatic declarative speech
marker o. The emphatic marker does not occur obligatorily, since (74) can
also be expressed without the emphatic speech marker as in (75).
      (75) Hiy lokre me,           senkin,         “Uwr prueyn
            hiy lokre me           so-enkin        uwr   prueyn
            3S.M shout speak DDEM-MAN man one
            hiykwe      mango yokun lie             owr a kok.”
            hiy-kwe mango yokun lie                 lowr la kok
            3S.M-TOP mango theft           go.up pick eat day.time
            ‘He shouted, “Someone has climbed up in the mango tree and
            is picking and eating all the fruit.”’
    Several devices can be used to negate utterances, making e.g. use of
the negation markers pey and pa (see §7.3.1). Emphasis can even be
added by other means than the emphatic negation markers (see §7.3.3).
These other negation constructions are far more productive. So the
previous example (73) can also be expressed as:
     (76) Hunkwe        i    se-aw            saw-sau e,
            hwon-kwe i       s-e-aw           saw-sau e

But the clause-final marker sō in (77) can be substituted by korey ‘NEG’ as
is shown in (78).
       (77) Hrorkwe liy non-ey. Sawk hakwe uwr-ar

7.4.4 Agreement of speech markers so, ko and mo
    In verbless clauses the speech marker agrees in number and gender
with the NP topic. This is not surprising since the nature of verbless
clauses is such that only one topic is encoded. The comment constituent
only gives additional new information about the topic. In (79), the speech
marker mo agrees in number with the NP huok somokwe ‘those pigs’.
      (79) Huok somokwe                  hano      aio    so
             huok so-mo-kwe              han-o aio        s-o

             pig    EMPH.SP.PFTV.PL
             ‘As for those pigs, they certainly are my father’s pigs.’
    In verbal clauses with only one NP the speech marker will naturally
agree in number and gender with that NP as is shown in (80) where the
speech marker mo agrees with the NP ney homkwe ‘the children’.
260      (80) Ney homkwe         perey    ma-nakey mõ?
           ney hom-kwe po-rey ma-nak-ley mo
           child 2/3PL-TOP Q-place RPT-ACC-go Q.SP.PFTV.PL
           ‘Where are the children going to?’
    If the clause hosts more than one NP, the choice can be difficult. Two
rules might compete with each other:
    1. The speech marker agrees with the NP that has patient role.
    2. The speech marker agrees with the NP that precedes the VP.
         (This is frequently a non-topicalised NP but not always as (80)
         demonstrates.)
    There is no conflict between the two rules in (81). The speech marker
so agrees with the NP that has the patient role. The same NP also precedes
the VP. The singular masculine speech marker so agrees in gender and
number with the object NP hoko ney se.
     (81) Pouh       hokwe       hoko         ney se           penkin
            pouh     hok-kwe hok-o            ney s-e          po-enkin

            RPT-CAUS-talk strongly        Q.SP.PFTV.M
            ‘How did mother convince her son?’
     There is a conflict between the two rules in (82). Based on the two
rules there were potentially two different choices since the NP that
precedes the VP and the NP that has patient role are two different NPs. In
(82), the speech marker agrees with huok ‘pig’ as the head of the NP,
based on the first rule that the speech marker agrees with the NP that has
patient role. The NP which precedes the VP (second rule) is the singular
interrogative posokwaw ‘who’ which is by default always masculine. If
the speech marker had agreed in gender and number with this NP the
sentence final marker would have been sõ. It is obvious from (82) that the
first rule was applied, in spite of the fact the patient NP is further to the left
and not even syntactically marked as object.
                                                                       261     (82) Huok hir        ouon ko            mokwe

          ‘As for the pigs inside the fence, who let them out?’
    When these two rules conflict, it is up to the speaker to choose which
constituent to focus on. In (83), the choice of the speech marker ko can be
defended on the basis of rule 2 and the use of the speech marker so can be
defended on the basis of rule 1. If the speaker wants to focus on the
mother as actor, ko will be selected, if the speaker wants to focus on the
child as patient so will be selected.
      (83) Ney se                kokwe     ipey      hok
             ney s-e             ko-kwe ipey         hok-kwe

             Q-MAN       do Q.SP.PFTV.F/M
             ‘What did mother do to her child?’
    In summary, the object NP is the most likely candidate to govern the
number and gender of the sentence final speech marker. Normally, it is the
object NP that precedes the verb phrase, which makes the choice of gender
and number for the speech marker straightforward, since the two rules
agree with each other. In (84), it would grammatically be incorrect to
establish agreement in gender and number between the subject and the
speech marker. (The feminine speech marker ko can only be utilised if the
object NP precedes the subject NP.)
      (84) Ipey      hokwe      ney se           penkin

2627.4.5 Speech markers following clause-final modal
markers
     A clause marked by the modal marker ey ‘intention’ or by the modal
marker ley ‘inchoative’ (§5.3) can only be followed by a perfective speech
utterance marker and never by an imperfective speech marker. In (85), ey
‘INT’ necessitates the use of the perfective interrogative speech marker sõ
in spite of the fact that the event referred to is a future event. The reason
for this phenomenon is related to the fact that ey ‘INT’ and ley ‘INCH’ are
clause-final markers. The speech utterance marker is a sentential marker.
The use of the perfective speech marker treats the sentence it marks as a
single event.

    In (86), the clause-final inchoative aspect marker ley can only be
followed by the sentence-final perfective negation speech marker.

intentional marker ey. When deleted, the speech marker follows the VP
and not a clause-final marker. The predication refers to a non-finished
present time event, which means that the imperfective speech marker
needs to be selected as is shown in (87).

7.4.6 Emphatic declarative speech marker with the
addressee
    As stated before the perfect speech utterance markers so, ko and mo
are mainly used to mark the interrogative mood, but also to indicate
emphatic negation and emphatic declarative.
    The emphatic declarative speech marker can be suffixed with an
addressee morpheme. There are three independent vocatives which are
used to address one or more persons: masculine ara, feminine akwa and
plural ama. Their independent use is exemplified in (88).
      (88) Hok         mesopok “Ara,        hno        sa pokwo?”
            hok        me-sopok ara         hwon-o sa     po-kwo

            ‘She asked, “Man, where is your wife?” He answered,
            “Woman, I do not know.”’
    From the masculine ara, feminine akwa and plural ama a set of three
addressee suffixes -ra, -kwa, and -ma is derived. The initial a is absorbed
264at the juncture when these addressee markers are suffixed to the three
emphatic declarative speech utterance markers so, ko, or mo.
    When the three addressee markers are suffixed to the three speech
markers so, ko and mo a total of nine different surface forms result as can
be seen in Table 45.

  Plural addressee: ama         so-ma         ko-ma          mo-ma   In (89), the final marker so ‘EMP.SP.PFTV.M’ makes a spoken assertion
more emphatic.

            so
            EMP.SP.PFTV.M
            ‘And the man answered, “I myself am the fierce crocodile
            man!”’    In (90), the same emphatic assertion is made with the inclusion of the
addressee. The marker so-ra consist of two parts: so- the emphatic
negation speech marker and -ra, the masculine singular addressee.
                                                                       265     (90) Hakwe Muruw               seirpey sora.

          1S-TOP crocodile-man fierce EMP.SP.PFTV.M-ADDR.M
          ‘Man, I myself am the fierce crocodile man!’
    Careful attention need to be paid to the fact that each of the nine
forms in Table 45 consist of two morphemes. These two morphemes have
their own gender and number. The first morpheme (so, ko, or mo)
generally marks the gender and number of the object, or in its absence, the
gender and number of the subject (see §7.4.4 for exceptions). The second
morpheme (-ra, -kwa, or -ma) marks the gender and number of the
addressee(s).
    In (91), the morpheme so agrees with the topic constituent of the
sentence, the subject hakwe, which is masculine, since it refers to a male
referent. The morpheme -ma agrees with the plural addressee (the older
brothers).
      (91) Hiykwe       senkin        me,     hyo        oryay

            ‘He said to his older brothers, “Men, I am your very own
            younger brother!”’
    In (92), the speech marker that includes the addressee kora is used in
a verbless clause. The first part of the marker ko-ra agrees with the
feminine topic constituent weyn ‘custom’ and the second part of ko-ra
agrees with the masculine gender of the addressee.
      (92) Weyn       sokukwe            piap kora!

             ‘Man, that deed is really bad!’
    In (93), the speech and addressee marker so-kwa occurs sentence
finally. The first part so- agrees with the head of the masculine subject
266kam ‘maternal uncle’ and the second part -kwa agrees with the feminine
addressee.

7.4.7 Speech markers so, ko and mo suffixed for
dubitative
    The speech markers so, ko and mo can be followed by the marker ney
which can also follow the future marker a (see §7.2). Whereas the future
marker a can be suffixed by both -ney and -ne, the speech utterance
markers so, ko and mo can only be suffixed by -ney which is analysed as a
marker that indicates uncertainty and doubt. The following forms can
occur: soney, koney and money. These sentence final markers obligatorily
co-occur with an interrogative preceding the verb phrase.
    In (94), the first bolded speech marker is suffixed with the dubitative
marker -ney. An obligatory interrogative pay ‘what’ precedes the verb
phrase. The speech marker has feminine gender which is triggered by the
interrogative pay. The form of what was seen triggered the selection of
feminine gender (see §3.3 for form of noun and gender). The second
bolded speech marker ko- is suffixed by the plural addressive marker -ma.
      (94) Hiy           me,     hyo       wayh me,        “Pay

            ‘He said to his friends, “What might that be? Men, money is

    In (95), the speech utterance is marked by soney. The first part so-
agrees in gender and number with the subject, a male person (see text
“The two brothers” in appendix). The feminine noun yayh ‘song’ is an
incorporated noun and therefore does not determine the gender and
number of the speech marker as a NP object would. The dubitative marker
-ney is suffixed to the speech marker. The obligatory interrogative in this
example is paneke ‘why’.
      (95) Hakwe yayh paneke lowk nayr soney?

             ‘Towards what end might I have had a singsing last night?’
    In (96), the speech marker ko- agrees in gender and number with the
head of the topic NP sa ‘woman’. It is suffixed by the dubitative marker
-ney. The obligatory interrogative is pay ‘what’ and occurs in the NP pay
sa where pay is used adjectivally in the meaning of what kind (§7.5.2).
      (96) Sa         hokwe       pay      sa       koney?

enemies) also hosts the obligatory interrogative.

2687.4.8 Agreement speech marker hi
    When the speaker wants to express agreement or endorsement the
sentence will be marked with hi. This sentence final marker often co-
occurs with the object marker which marks the sentence as a command.
The sentence final hi expresses the speaker’s endorsement and agreement
with the given command.
      In (98), the agreement marker hi is added to express full endorsement.
        (98) Pouh-nawp hok me,            ney ke,           “Kwa nakey

     The object marker e expressing imperative can be deleted, making the
statement less of a directive, as is shown in (99)
      (99) Pouh-nawp hok me,              ney ke,       “Kwa nakey

     All interrogatives are based on the bound morpheme po-
‘interrogative’. Vowel syncopation takes places in a number of
interrogatives, reducing po- to p-. These morphophonemic changes are
discussed in the relevant sections.
     Interrogatives function either as an adverbial or as the head or a
modifying part of a noun phrase. or as an adverbial immediately preceding
the verb phrase. The overview of all interrogatives in Table 46 does not
list the possible feminine and plural forms in an attempt not to overload
the table with too much detail. The table also does not indicate which of
the listed interrogatives can also function as a modifier of the head of the
NP (§7.5.2)

to what end
    Interrogatives fill different grammatical slots. Three different
functions have been observed. The interrogative can function as:
    a. a pronoun interrogative functioning as head of the NP (101). When
        head of the NP, the pronoun interrogative can be marked for
        subject or object or marked by a postpositional noun phrase
        marker (§7.5.1).
    b. a noun phrase modifier which either precedes or follows the head
        of the NP (102). The interrogative modifies the head of the noun
        phrase. This includes constructions with the interrogative marked
        for genitive (§7.5.2).
    c. an adverbial interrogative immediately preceding the verb phrase
        (103). The adverbial interrogative is never part of the noun
        phrase, but functions as a separate adverbial phrase (See §7.5.3).
      In (101), the non-human pronominal interrogative pay is head of the
NP and marked for object.
      (101) Hiykwe     hane    pay se       kow so?
            hiy-kwe han-e po-ay s-e         kow so
            3S.M-TOP 1S-OBJ Q-what 3S.M-OBJ BEN Q.SP.PFTV.M
            ‘What did he give me?’
    In (102), the interrogative modifier pay modifies the head of the noun
phrase ahney ‘bird’.
                                                                       271    (102) Ahney sohokwe               pay       ahney so?

          ‘As for that bird, what kind of bird is it?’
    In (103), the adverbial interrogative pankaw constitutes a separate
adverbial phrase that precedes the verb phrase. The use of pankaw in
forming polar and measurement questions is discussed in §7.5.3.3.
    (103) Hano wueir-omeme mokwe                pankaw      lanio

           opriy o
           take Q.SP.IPFTV
           ‘Were my garden goods taken away?’
    In the next two sections the interrogative as the head of the noun
phrase and the interrogative as a noun phrase modifier are discussed. The
adverbial interrogative is discussed in §7.5.3.
7.5.1 The interrogative as head of the noun phrase
    The interrogative is the head of the noun phrase and can be marked
syntactically for subject and object. In some environments it can also be
marked by a postpositional marker.
    The following interrogative pronouns have been observed that can
function as head of the NP:
    a. Human interrogatives (seeking to identify from an open group)
    b. Non-human interrogatives (seeking to identify from an open
        group)
    c. Location interrogatives (seeking to identify location or name).","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285]"
"3.10.1.1 Pre-head constituents
     The only phrase constituents able to appear before the head are
independent pronouns or phrases marked with the genitive suffix -o. In
(146), the first hano ‘my’ is an independent personal pronoun with
genitive marking, modifying the head noun sa ‘woman’. The second hano
is a genitive pronoun modifying kam ‘uncle’. The noun phrase hano kam
‘my uncle’ itself is modified by the genitive marker so. Together they
form a possessive phrase modifying the head noun ney ‘child’:
     (146) Hano      sa         hokwe         hano     kam so
             han-o sa           hok-kwe       han-o kam s-o

             ney korey
             child NEG
             ‘My wife is not the daughter of my maternal uncle.’
   In (147), the head of the noun phrase is the final noun ney ‘child’,
which is modified by four underlined genitive constructions.
    (147) Hiykwe            hano     ipey     ko         hiom
           hiy-kwe          han-o ipey        k-o        hiom

           ‘He is my mother’s brother’s daughter’s son.’
1083.10.1.2 Head constituent
    The head of the noun phrase is either a noun or a compound noun. All
standard noun phrases are underlined and the head constituent is bolded.

    Constituents following the head of the noun phrase include qualifiers,
numeral/quantifier, object/subject marker, semantic case role markers, and
topic markers.

3.10.2 Headless noun phrase
    The headless noun phrase is very much like the standard noun phrase,
except that its head is deleted. A pre-head or post-head constituent
                                                                        111(modifier and/or quantifier) is the only obligatory constituent of this NP.
The deleted head is understood from the context.
   In (154), a quantifier refers to the deleted noun huok ‘pig’. This
quantifier and the masculine object marker se both refer to the ellipted
noun.
    (154) Huok somokwe                  hakan. Sawk hakwe

     In (155), the topic mu ‘crocodiles’ is understood, and so the noun is
ellipted:

     An ellipted noun can be referred to by both a modifier and a quantifier
as is shown in the elicited example (156).

            ‘Man, let’s just only take three big ones.’
    Especially in verbless clauses, the ellipted head of the NP can also be
referred to by a pre-head constituent, either by a possessive pronoun (157)
or by a noun marked for genitive (158).
     (157) Youk       sokukwe           hyo.
             youk     so-ko-kwe         hiy-o

             ‘That paddle is his.’
     (158) Youk       sokukwe           aio      so.

             ‘That paddle is father’s.’
3.10.3 Noun phrase with a pronoun as head
    A personal pronoun (in either subject or object form) can head a NP.
This type of NP mostly consists of only the head (§3.1.2), but can also be
followed by an oblique marker and/or topic marker.
    In (159), the head of the bolded NP is followed by the oblique marker
nion ‘Accompaniment’
    (159) Hakwe hehe                nion non-ohruw-a pa.
            ha-kwe hoh-e            nion non-lohruw-a pa

            ‘I did not talk with the two of them.’
   In (160), the head of the bolded NP is followed by the general topic
marker kokwe.
   (160) Hiykwe            hane kokwe         ok kamon ke
           hiy-kwe         han-e ko-kwe ok kamon k-e

           me     nonkway kow pa
           speak know        BEN NEG.PFTV
           ‘He did not give me one talk (= piece of information).’
3.10.4 Conjoined noun phrase
   A list of nouns joined together by the conjunction o ‘and’ forms the
head of the conjoined NP.
    A conjoined noun phrase can function as either the subject or object
of its containing clause. The final noun phrase marker indicates the
syntactic function of the noun phrase. In (161), the object demonstrative
seme-aw has as its scope both nouns, wayh ‘yam’ and yoh ‘banana’.
    (161) Hakwe wayh o, yoh     o, seme-aw           la
          ha-kwe wayh o  yoh    o   so-m-e-aw        la

           ‘I just ate those yams and bananas, and then I lay down and
           slept.’
    In (162), the conjoined NP is marked by the nominative pronominal
marker homkwe, which indicates that the underlined NP functions as
subject of the clause.
    (162) Hoko         ipey     o, aio        o, homkwe
             hok-o     ipey     o     aio     o    hom-kwe

             3S.F-OBJ nose do angry
             ‘Her mother and her father were angry with her.’
     A conjoined NP is not limited to only two constituents. Whenever a
longer list is introduced the occurrence of the manner adverb preceding
the VP is necessary. In example (163), the adverb senkin is obligatory to
introduce a list of conjoined NPs.
114      (163) Wueir sohokwe,              hiykwe          senkin
            wueir so-ho-kwe,            hiy-kwe         so-enkin

            and food-shoot some and
            ‘As for his garden, he planted thus: banana shoots and taro
            shoots and sugarcane shoots and some other food type
            shoots.’3.11 Zero marking on noun phrases
    More than 90% of all noun phrases are marked by topic, syntactic and
semantic markers. This section discusses the function of zero marking on
the noun phrase. Zero marking here means the absence of any of the topic,
syntactic and semantic markers listed in Table 22, Table 25, Table 26, and
Table 29.
3.11.1 Zero marking as a result of noun incorporation
   Zero marking on nouns can partly be explained by the occurrence of
noun incorporation. Mithun (1984:848-9) states:
          Compounding is done for a reason. Some entity,
          quality, or activity is recognised sufficiently often to
          be considered name-worthy in its own right. … Such
          compounding has a significant effect on the role of
          the N involved. In He is off berry-picking, the word
          berry does not refer to a specific berry, nor to a
          particular bushful of berries: it qualifies the V,
          describing the type of picking in progress. Because it
          does not refer, it is not marked for definiteness or
          number.","[121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128]"
"1.4 Dialects
     The Abau people recognise only general speech differences between
some villages and have no names of dialect areas. On the basis of the
sociolinguistic survey by Bill Martin (1980) the language group was
divided into three dialects. My wife and I carried out a second survey in
1984. It basically confirmed Martin’s findings to divide the Abau
Language in three dialects: Up-River, Central and Down-River dialect. It
was noted, however, that differences within the Down-River dialect
needed to be looked at. Six villages belong to this group and it was
observed that speakers of the three most eastern villages (Beimaf, Senou
and Wagu) had far more difficulties communicating with speakers of the
Central Dialect than the speakers of the other three Down-River dialect
villages (Baiwai, Bifro and Baio).
    In 1993, another small survey was done to compare the central dialect
with the six villages of the Down-River Dialect. (Through circumstances
it was not possible to survey Senou, the village that is located between
Beimaf and Wagu.)
     It is obvious that a language survey done in an unknown language
yields less precise results than a survey done after a number of years of
language research, since the surveyor has a better grasp of the phonetics
of the language and the ability to avoid incorrect glosses due to
miscommunication. We found that it was misleading to exclusively rely
on cognate figures. For example, the central dialect village Yabru shares a
cognate percentage of 97% with Wagu, the most eastern village of the
language group. This high cognate figure suggests good mutual
intelligibility which is, however, not the case.

    In the next table the cognate readings are broken up into two figures.
The first number shows the number of words that are phonemically
identical. The second number after the slash indicates the number of
words that are different but can be still regarded as cognate. The total of
the two numbers should be the same as the cognate figure in the table
above. The table below shows that the number of identical words between
Yabru and Wagu is only 64% and that a third of the Wagu vocabulary
consists of words that have at least one different vowel or consonant than
their Yabru counterparts. This fact logically has a negative effect on the
ease of communication between Yabru and Wagu speakers.

 Border
    In conclusion, as Martin suggested the villages Yabru, Buna,
Beisiabru, Hokru, Dio, Abaru, Simia, Meiniabru, Ibru, Mukways and
Mahney can be combined in the Central dialect.
    The villages Hufi, Kasiaru, Biak 1, Sowkmayon, Kopraru, Idam 1,
Idam 2 and Wauru can be grouped in the Up-River dialect. The remaining
6 villages were grouped by Martin as the Down-River dialect.
The findings of the 1993 survey strongly suggest to make a further
division. The villages Baiwai, Bifro and Baio form the Down-River
dialect. The three villages Wagu, Beimaf and Senou have their own
dialect, which could be called, in view of their proximity to the province
border with the East Sepik, the Down-River Border dialect.

1.5 Language use and bilingualism
    Three languages are used among the twenty five villages that make up
the Abau language group: Abau, Tok Pisin and in restricted context
English.
    Abau is likely to be used in gatherings that deal with issues like
sorcery, disputes about land, women and property, marriage arrangements,
funeral rites, etc.
    The further an Abau speaking village is removed from the Green
River Station, the higher the likelihood that discussions take place in Abau
rather than Tok Pisin. The Green River Station accommodates a large
number of non-local people who serve the large Green River areas as
administrators, police officers, teachers, medical and agricultural workers.
Many of them do not speak any of the local languages surrounding the
Green River Station Area.
    Tok Pisin is likely to be used when a key person involved in a
discussion does not have a good control of the Abau language. The
number of the people in that category is still increasing through
intermarriage. When the topic of discussion relates to a notion that has
been introduced by outsiders (e.g. the clinic, school, church, planting of
rubber trees) it becomes more likely that the communication takes place in
Tok Pisin.
     English is used nearly exclusively within the school system or with
visitors to the area who do not speak Tok Pisin. Even teachers will prefer
Tok Pisin over English when they are out of the school context.
     Tok Pisin is widely used in all villages which are only one day travel
away from the Green River station and understood by children and adults
of all ages. It is less frequently used in villages which are further away
from Green River, but even there it is understood by all age groups. This
is remarkable given the fact that hardly anyone spoke or understood Tok
Pisin in the 1950s. Abau is still a vital language, but the number of young
people who feel more comfortable in Tok Pisin than in Abau is slowly
growing. These young people have often been away for long periods from
the language area because of High School or work. There is a strong
appreciation of their own language and culture, but on the other hand
there is no real shame involved in admitting to have poor mother tongue
language skills.
8
1.6 Use of the Abau language in writing
    After the completion of the basic work on the phonology analysis, a
week-long orthography conference was organised where a group of
twelve educated and influential Abau speakers made decisions on the
Abau orthography. See Lock and Lock (1993) for more background
information on the decision process.
     We were able to facilitate the growth of a large educational program.
The Abau Training Centre developed and played a major role in training
more than 100 local teachers and producing primers and reading books in
Abau. Thanks to the high level of local involvement, it was possible to
start schools for children in all 25 Abau speaking villages. The education
program started in 1990 when a third of the Abau speaking villages had a
literacy rate of less than 5%. The curriculum started out as a one year
program, changed to a two year program in 1993, and in 2005 a third year
was added. The Abau village school enrollment figures represent
approximately 2000 children who learned to read and write through the
Abau schools. Children are tested yearly and more than 80% of these
children qualify as adequate to good readers.
    The Training Centre also opened its doors for courses for adults.
These courses combined the reading and writing of Abau with such other
topics as mathematics, calculator use, simple bookkeeping, manual
typewriter skills, correspondence courses on family life and religion,
creative topics such as arts and music, etc.
    For more background on the set-up and the philosophy behind this
program, see Lock (2008), a paper presented at an International
Conference on Language Development.","[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

3.4.6 Relationship between the assignment of gender
and numeral class of nouns
     As stated before, the gender of a noun is in large part determined by
its physical form and may actually be assigned a different gender if its
physical appearance is sufficiently different (see §3.3). The choice of the
Abau numeral is also in many cases determined by the physical form of
the noun it modifies and the choice of the numeral classifier can be
66changed if the form of the object denoted by the noun changes. It should
be noted that nouns belonging to the same class do not automatically have
the same gender, e.g.:
    uwr ‘man’ (masc)         sa ‘woman’ (fem)      - class 1 nouns.
    a ‘house’ (masc)         yeyn ‘moon’ (fem)     - class 2 nouns.
    now-ho ‘stick’ (masc) youk ‘paddle’ (fem) - class 5 nouns.
     Table 21 below lists a number of nouns which are modified by one of
the twelve classes of numerals. For each noun the gender is given. Most
nouns do not have inherent gender and may be given a variety of numeral
classifiers depending on the feature being highlighted. Nouns denote
entities which can have many different physical forms and appearances
which impact the selection of the numeral classifier and gender
assignment. Classes 1 to 5 are truly mixed for gender. Classes 6 to 12
seem to stick to one gender only.
     A summary of the gender and numeral class assignment of nouns:
     Class 1, which represents human beings, is naturally represented by
         both genders.
     Class 2 is the default class; not surprisingly, it also has mixed gender.
     Class 3 is represented by small, round, three-dimensional items.
         Because of the three-dimensional factor it attracts mostly
         masculine objects. However, if the feature roundness is regarded
         as more prominent, the nouns are assigned feminine gender e.g.
         payr ‘a rather round fish’, yeyn ‘moon’.
     Class 4 is partly characterised by the feature flat surface. This feature
         is also characteristic for feminine nouns. The ‘experience’ nouns
         are frequently feminine, though not always, e.g. prawk ‘scent’ is
         masculine. The class four numeral is also used for masculine
         nouns like owk ‘string bag’ and ine-maku ‘forehead’. The
         selection of masculine gender gives reason to believe that another
         determining factor is in play than the feature flat surface. It is
         unclear though what this category could be.
     Class 5 numerals are characterised by length. As stated before the
         feature extendedness is a mark of masculine nouns as contrasted
         with the feature flat surface which relates to feminine nouns. The
         gender of an object with both features (e.g. youk ‘paddle’, pisu
         ‘machete’, ku ‘axe’) is generally determined by the feature flat
                                                                         67       surface. However, in determining numeral class, the feature
       extendedness is more prominent; thus words like youk ‘paddle’,
       pisu ‘machete’ and ku ‘axe’ do not come under class 4 but under
       class 5.
    Class 6 is a group of solely masculine nouns that represent
       geographical entities. Feminine geographical entities like howk
       ‘lake’ and iwa ‘swamp’ are not part of this class.
    Class 7 is a group of solely feminine nouns which are characterised
       by two-dimensionality.
     As stated above, the numeral classifiers of classes 8 to 12 mark a very
restricted number of nouns. It is noteworthy that they are all masculine
nouns. In the present data corpus, only two members have been observed
for classes 8 and 10. Members of classes 9, 11 and 12 all refer to long
objects, and are therefore masculine.

3.5     Adjectives
    In this section the limited use of adjectival modifiers within Abau is
commented on and illustrations of alternative devices to express
descriptive notions are given. The contrast between nouns and adjectival
modifiers is discussed.
3.5.1 The extent of the use of adjectival constructions
     The number of adjectives is very low. It covers in broad strokes the
range of sizes (e.g. aiopey ‘big’, sowpwareney ‘small’, mei ‘long’, hiymiy
‘tall’, etc.), age (e.g. naw ‘old’, iwon ‘young’ or ‘new’) and various
quality indications (piap ‘bad’, yaprue ‘good’,’ ihey ‘excellent’).
     Colours are not really adjectives but are descriptive of other items that
reflect that particular colour, e.g. or ‘black ‘ also means ‘burnt wood’. Ou
‘red’ is also used in compound nouns that contain reddish colours, e.g.
yoh-ou ‘ripe banana’, naw-ou ‘reddish sago’. (These words exhibit the
pitch pattern that is distinctive for compound nouns, §3.2.2.) Other colour
terms are formed with the help of the NP marker eyn ‘similar’, e.g.
woukmow-si eyn ‘similar to the excrement of a dove’ (= greenish) or
wouknow-hu eyn ‘similar to the juice of ginger (= yellowish)’. The origin
of weys ‘white’ is not really known. It can be used in compound nouns
ohi-weys ‘skin-white (= white person)’ or pekney-weys ‘spotless entity-
white (= pristine white)’.
    Many concepts which are expressed by adjectives in English are
expressed in Abau by a combination of a noun and a verb or a noun with
the comitative marker non, as illustrated in (65):
      (65) Hiykwe       iha lopa.
            3S.M-TOP hand NEG
            ‘He has no hands (= he is stingy).’
            Hiykwe      kasaw lon-peys.

            ‘He swells his nose (= he is jealous).’
            Hiykwe      kasaw lon-hohuaw.
            3S.M-TOP nose do-breath
            ‘He is breathing (his) nose (= he is angry).’
70            Hiykwe      siowp      lokrue.
            3S.M-TOP stomach die
            ‘He is dying (his) stomach (= he is hungry).’
            Hiykwe      peik       non.
            3S.M-TOP sickness CMT
            ‘He is with sickness (= he is sick).’
            Hiykwe      omeme ihey-ar             non.
            3S.M-TOP things excellent-INTF CMT
            ‘He is with very good things (= he is rich).’
3.5.2 Similarity in distribution of the intensifier and
restrictive marker within the NP
     Nouns and adjectives are both structurally distinct from verbs as they
cannot be affixed by any of the verbal affixes listed in §4.2.1, Table 33.
Structurally nouns are not different from modifiers. Both host similar
affixes like -ar ‘intensifier’ and -aw ‘restrictive’. See examples (20) and
(21).
    These markers can also be used with adjectives, as is illustrated
below.
    In (66), the intensifier -ar is affixed to a temporal noun paraw and the
adjective ihey (which is part of a NP).
      (66) Paraw-ar kokwe             Yeyn o, Ey o,
             paraw-ar ko-kwe yeyn o                 ey o

             hohkwe wayh ihey-ar                    non-wak.

             3DU-TOP friend excellent-INTF DU-be
             ‘Long ago the Moon and the Sun were really good friends.’
    In (67), the adjectives ihey ‘excellent’ and haraw ‘short’ are modified
by respectively -ar and -aw.
                                                                            71     (67) Hiykwe            yier    ihey-ar     mon ma-ley iwak
          hiy-kwe           yier    ihey-ar     mon ma-ley liwak

          ‘He came to a very good place to sit and rest (= holidays), for
          just a short time.’
    Although the suffix -aw in (67) has been interpreted as ‘restrictive’ a
case could be made that the marker -aw affixed to adjectives should be
labelled ‘emphatic’. As discussed in §3.1.4, the marker -aw can have the
meaning ‘emphatic’ under certain circumstances. Example (68) illustrates
the same interpretation dilemma of -aw.
      (68) Skul      sohokwe             mei-aw-ar           nuw-wak,
            skul     so-ho-kwe           mei-aw-ar           nuw-lwak
            school DDEM-GL.M-TOP long-RSTR-INTF INT-be
            yier-ar      mon lwak pey.
            yier-ar      mon lwak pey
            place-INTF LOC be           NEG.IPFTV
             ‘That school is just far away, it is not in the very village (= it
            is not where we live).’
    In (68), the restrictive marker -aw precedes -ar in the predicate
modifier mei-aw-ar. The marker -aw can be analysed as restrictive ‘just
very far’ or as emphatic ‘really very far’.
3.5.2.1 Further distribution of intensifier and restrictive marker
    For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that the
intensifier -ar and the restrictive marker -aw not only mark nouns and
adjectives but also pronouns (§3.1.4) and numerals (§3.4.4.3.).
    In (69), the numeral kamon ‘one’ is marked by the restrictive marker
-aw.
72     (69) Yeyk hokwe,          hakwe enekwei kamon-aw
          yeyk ho-kwe          ha-kwe enekwei kamon-aw

          saw-meio lowpway
          SPD-work completely
          ‘As for the canoe, I finished it quickly in only one day.’
   In (70), the intensifier -ar is affixed to a personal pronoun which is
modified by -kwaw ‘restrictive’.
     (70) Hano uwr ey,             hunkwaw-ar         sara.
           han-o uwr ey            hwon-kwaw-ar       so-ra
           1S-GEN man EXCL 2S.SUB-RSTR-INTF EMPH.SP.M-ADDR.M
           ‘Oh, my husband, it is really just you.’
3.5.3 Contrast between nouns and modifiers
   Nouns and modifiers (referring not only to adjectives, but also to
adverbs) differ in
   1) distribution
   2) government.
    In terms of their distribution, nouns always precede modifiers within
the noun phrase and precede the NP final marker.
      (71) Hano       aiai-yok           ihey      mokwe      pan po
            han-o aiai-yok               ihey      mo-kwe     pan po

            ACC-hide      cover
            ‘My outstanding plant shoots have been covered over by
            grass.’
    In (71), ihey ‘excellent’ is part of the noun phrase modifying the head
noun. Ihey ‘excellent’ cannot be analysed as part of the compound noun
aiai-yok ‘plant shoots’ because it does not have the contrastive intonation
contour that is typical for compound nouns. (See §3.2). It is followed by
the NP final topic marker mokwe that agrees in number with the head of
the NP.
                                                                        73     In terms of government, adjectives do not and cannot determine the
number and gender of phrase final markers, whereas nouns do. This is
even true for a noun phrase without a surface noun. In Abau, a modifier
followed only by a phrase final marker can constitute a headless NP. The
actual head is an ellipted noun which is recoverable from the context. This
ellipted noun, not the modifier, determines the gender and number
signalled by the phrase final marker.
       (72) Ara,        ai   mokwe,       hakwe        pokon aiopey
             ara        ai   mok-we       ha-kwe       pokon aiopey

             ‘Man, as for fish, today I am going to shoot a big one in the
             water.’
    In (72), the ellipted noun is ai ‘fish’. The feminine, singular object
marker ke agrees with this ellipted noun, not with the modifier, aiopey
‘big’, which has no gender or number. In (73), the ellipted noun in the NPs
piap me and yaprue me is am ‘breadfruit’.
      (73) Am            lowpwarowp yaprue korey. Hiykwe
            am           lowpwarowp yaprue korey hiy-kwe

            ‘All the breadfruit was not good. He threw the bad ones away,
            but he ate the good ones.’
3.5.4 Modifiers functioning as adjectives, adverbs and
predicates
     Modifiers can fill different functions depending on their positions
within the clause. They can function as modifiers within the noun phrase,
or as modifiers of the verb phrase (adverbial phrase), or they can function
as the predicate of the sentence.
74     (74) Aiai yaprue somokwe              yaprue nuw-ie.
          aiai yaprue so-mo-kwe            yaprue nuw-lie
          food good      DDEM-GL.PL-TOP good      INT-go.up
          ‘That good food really comes up well.’
    In (74), the first yaprue ‘good’ modifies the head of NP and precedes
the demonstrative topic marker which agrees in number with the head of
the NP. The second yaprue ‘good’ is not part of the NP it follows. It is an
independent adverbial phrase that modifies the verb phrase (§4.4).
     Modifiers can also function as the predicate of the clause as is
illustrated in (75):
       (75) Hmo            owh mokwe,           har mokwe          aiopey,
              hom-o        owh mo-kwe           har    mo-kwe      aiopey

              ‘In regard to their bodies (= size), some were big and some
              were small.’
3.5.5 Adjectival use of the manner demonstratives
   There are two manner demonstratives which are mostly used
adverbially but also used adjectivally: the proximal and distal manner
demonstratives enkin and senkin.
    The attributive use of this manner demonstrative should not be
confused with its adverbial use. When used adverbially it refers to
manner; when used adjectivally its meaning shifts as can be seen in the
examples below.
     In (76) and (77), the manner demonstratives senkin and enkin are used
attributively. The manner demonstrative senkin can be repeated as is
shown in (76) expressing the concept of ‘various’.
                                                                         75     (76) Hiykwe     wueir meio nok, wueir-aiai          senkin

          ‘He made a garden and then he planted various types of
          garden food.’
    The proximal manner demonstrative enkin is frequently combined
with enekwei ‘time’ to mark present time (in contrast with the past). In
(77), enkin is used attributively.
      (77) Enekwei enkin ohokwe                 Kembu hiykwe

             ‘Presently, Kembu is imprisoned in Vanimo.’
    The adverbial use of senkin is discussed in §4.4.2.","[79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89]"

     Most quotes are introduced by senkin rather than enkin and some
speakers prefer to use senkin exclusively when used adverbially. The
attributive use of enkin as part of a NP is accepted by all, but its adverbial
use is often scrutinized, though not rejected altogether. When used, the
adverbial use of enkin stands out, and probably adds emphasis to the
speech act. Example (56) is taken from a translated Bible passage; the
manner adverb could be rendered as ‘in this particular way’. (See also
(59) on the use of enkin to introduce direct speech.)

     When the manner adverbial senkin introduces direct speech, it
normally precedes the verb phrase. However, it is possible to place senkin
in tail position. Examples (58) and (59) demonstrate the use of senkin and
enkin in tail position just before a quote.

4.4.3 Adverbial causal demonstrative
    The demonstrative object marker set (see §3.8.2) consists of three
distal object markers (sehe, sokwe and seme) and three proximal object
markers (ehe, okwe and eme). In contrast to the proximal object
demonstratives, the distal object demonstratives can also be used
adverbially as a causal demonstrative.
     When the distal object demonstratives, sehe, sokwe and seme are used
attributively they are part of an object NP. When an object demonstrative
is used adverbially it is the only constituent of the adverbial phrase that
immediately precedes the VP. Its function is to express a causal
relationship.
    Not all demonstratives can be used both adverbially and attributively.
The distal manner demonstrative senkin is used frequently, but the use of
the proximal manner demonstrative enkin is rare. No occurrences of the
adverbial use of the proximal object demonstratives ehe, okwe and eme
have been observed.
    For the sake of comparison one example is given of the attributive use
of an object demonstrative. In (60), the masculine object demonstrative
sehe modifies the head of the NP how ‘taro’. The demonstrative
anaphorically refers to the entity how ‘taro’ that was introduced
previously.
158      (60) Uwrsa        homkwe             how aiopey hay

           ‘The people were really afraid of the big taro. Then one day, a
           woman went (there) and took that taro.’
     The object demonstratives are more often used adverbially than
attributively. When used adverbially, one of the three distal demonstrative
object markers (sehe, sokwe or seme) occurs as the only member of a
phrase constituent immediately preceding the verb phrase. The
demonstrative object marker refers to a previous clause or sentence. The
distal object demonstrative encodes a relationship of logical consequence
between the clause it occurs in and the clause or sentence to which it
anaphorically refers.
    A demonstrative object marker can only mark a relationship of logical
consequence when it is used adverbially. Two conditions need to be met:
    a. the demonstrative marker immediately precedes the verb phrase;
    b. the demonstrative marker is the only constituent within the
       phrase. If it is part of a noun phrase it cannot anaphorically refer
       to a clause or sentence. (E.g. sehe in (60) is not used adverbially
       but attributively because it is part of a NP.)
     The choice of the gender or number of the adverbial demonstrative
depends on the gender and number of the most prominent noun phrase
that is involved in the effects of the causal relationship. In most cases this
is the constituent who experiences the effects of the action. This choice,
however, is arbitrary and the speaker may choose to establish agreement
with the agent rather than the patient. See example (63).
                                                                         159    When one of the members of the adverbial demonstrative set is placed
directly before the verb phrase the speaker indicates that the event of the
clause the marker occurs in is enabled, but not necessarily forced by the
previous clause or sentence. It is a relationship of logical consequence and
whether the relationship is more causal or circumstantial depends on the
various contexts.
     In (61), the bolded masculine adverbial demonstrative sehe,
anaphorically relates to the previous sentence. The relationship it indicates
is one of logical consequence. The second adverbial demonstrative seme
anaphorically relates to a subordinate clause marked by ankin
‘while/when’. The adverbial demonstrative seme establishes a logical
relationship between the event of the log breaking and the people falling
into the water.

             So as the tree consequently broke, they all, as a result, fell
             into the water.’
    In (61), the masculine adverbial demonstrative sehe agrees in number
and gender with the most prominent (and in this case only) NP of the
sentence it refers to. This NP now hokwe ‘the tree’ occurs in the
anaphorically referred to sentence and it is also mentioned within the
clause itself, now se ‘tree 3S.M.OBJ’. It should be noted that the
demonstrative sehe cannot be analysed as part of the noun phrase now se,
since a noun phrase cannot be marked by both the object marker se and
the demonstrative marker sehe.
160      The plural adverbial demonstrative seme agrees in number with the NP
most affected by the event: the plural subject hom lowpwarowp ‘2/3PL
all’.
    In (62), the adverbial demonstrative sehe immediately precedes the
verb phrase. It follows the NP object hoko uwruh se ‘her husband’ which
has its own object marker se. The demonstrative marker sehe is therefore
not part of the preceding NP. The marker sehe establishes a relationship of
logical consequence between the woman seeing the bird and the woman
reporting this. The adverbial marker sehe agrees in number and gender
with the most prominent NP within the event indicated by the clause: the
masculine NP object hoko uwruh se ‘her husband’.

             ground. Consequently she said to her husband, “Man, there’s
             a bird over there.”’
     In (63), the speaker establishes agreement in number and gender
between the adverbial demonstrative seme and plural subject skul-uwr-ney
sa-ney homkwe ‘the school boys and girls’ rather than the singular,
masculine object hye ‘3S.OBJ’. The presence of kow ‘BEN’ plays a role in
this. The object noun phrase hye is not the patient but the recipient of the
verbal action. NPs that have a patient role are more likely to correspond in
gender and/or number with the adverbially used object demonstrative.

          the school boys and girl laughed at him, about (the fact that

    The relationship of logical consequence encoded by the adverbial
demonstrative object marker is not always a purely causal relationship. It
can be a circumstantial relationship where a change in circumstances
enables another event to take place.
     In (64), the adverbial demonstrative sehe relates the temporal
subordinate clause marked by ankin ‘as/when’ to the event in the main
clause. The two clauses do not relate in a purely causal sense, but they
relate to each other in a logical sense. The change in circumstances as
expressed by the temporal clause, allowed the event in the main clause to
take place.
       (64) Sa         aio     hiykiaw     lonuayk sian      ankin,

            ‘When father himself woke up and got up, he consequently
            chased after the two of them during the night.’
162     Example (65) illustrates the same point. The feminine adverbial
demonstrative sokwe relates the two clauses in a logical sense. The change
in circumstances as expressed by the temporal clause (getting closer to the
village), allowed the event in the main clause to take place (hearing the
animal’s noise). The events of the main clause are enabled, but not forced
or caused by the event expressed in the subordinate clause. The feminine
demonstrative sokwe agrees with the feminine NP object wown-oksa ke
‘cuscus-noise OBJ.F’ and not with the masculine NP subject hiykwe
‘3S.SUB’.
      (65) Hiy yier ohriar sok lwak liok                  menkin,

    The adverbial demonstrative indicating a causal relationship can also
be used in a negated sentence with the help of the existential verb lwak
(see example (66)).

  5. Tense, Aspect and Mood    This chapter deals with the categories of tense, aspect and mood. As
in many other languages it is difficult to make sharp distinctions between
grammatical tense, aspect and mood, since these concepts are conflated to
some degree in Abau. The discussion in §5.1 makes clear that Abau
makes a distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect and that
the verb or verb phrase does not display tense distinctions. The markers
discussed in §5.2 all precede the verb phrase and grammatically behave
the same. Some of these markers are more modal (see §5.2.1 and §5.2.2)
and others more aspectual in nature. Finally in §5.3, the aspect and modal
markers following the verb are discussed. These markers express the
following distinctions: inchoative, intention, desirability and doubtfulness.
    Markers which mark the clause for mood and negation are dealt with
in §7 where the clause-final imperative, indefinite future, interrogative,
emphatic indicative and negation markers are discussed.","[169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177]"

"7.5.1.1 Human interrogative functioning as head of the NP
     The human interrogative is used for any living being treated as a
‘person’, including humans, spirits and animals behaving like humans.
They are not differentiated for gender or number on the interrogative word
itself. The human interrogative is used to select from an open group. (This
in contrast to the interrogative set represented by pohiy, which is used to
272seek the identity of an entity from a closed group of potential
alternatives.)
     (104) Hano       yoh     mokwe,       posokwaw   nuw-a
             han-o yoh        mo-kwe       po-so-kwaw nuw-la

             mo
             Q.SP.PFTV.PL
             ‘As for my bananas, who ate them?’
     The analysis of so as a human marker is made with some hesitation,
because this distinction is not found elsewhere. Animate and inanimate
agents can often be referred to by the same referential markers (e.g.
compare the use of subject pronoun in §3.7.1). In spite of this hesitation
on the correct meaning of the morpheme so-, it is clear that the usage of
this particular interrogative is limited to human beings.
    Table 47 shows the human interrogative in various functions. The
human interrogative is the head of the NP when it functions as subject or
object. The human interrogative can also precede the head noun of the NP.
In that position it should be analysed as either a modifier interrogative
(see §7.5.2) or a genitive interrogative.

       NP (§7.5.2)                     Q-HUM    The suffix -kwaw in posokwaw is analysed as a restrictive marker (see
§3.1.4 on the analysis of -kwaw when suffixed to pronouns). The
                                                                       273interrogative posokwaw references the subject in verbal clauses (104) or
can fill the comment slot in a verbless clause (105).
    The question in (105) is asked of a female. This information is carried
by the feminine speech marker ko that follows the interrogative.
    (105) Hunkwe        posokwaw            ko?            Hno
            hwon-kwe po-so-kwaw             ko             hwon-o

            name 1S-OBJ HOR speak BEN
            ‘Who are you? Tell me your name.’
    As stated above, the basic form for the personal interrogative is poso.
The genitive would be *poso-o, which reduces by vowel syncope to poso.
Examples (106) and (107) demonstrate the use of the genitive
interrogative.
     (106) Hiykwe            poso         wayh so?
             hiy-kwe         po-so-o      wayh so

             fire-smoke Q.SP.PFTV.PL
             ‘As for those smoke clouds, whose smoke clouds are they?’
    The object form of the human interrogative is marked by -e. The
surface form pose (or pese when the optional vowel harmony rule is
applied) is not suffixed for gender or number.
    (108) Hai, hiykwe           mnuw       mon pese
             hai hiy-kwe mnuw              mon po-so-e

             CAUS-go.up Q.SP.PFTV.PL
             ‘Who (plural) did he lead up the mountain?’
274    Example (108) seeks to discover the identity of more than one person,
but the plural number is not indicated by the interrogative pese but by the
clause-final plural speech marker mo.
     (109) Hiykwe        pisu se         kokwe       pese
             hiy-kwe     pisu s-e        ko-kwe      po-so-e

             give Q.SP.PFTV.S.M
             ‘To whom did he give the knife?’
     In (109), the speaker anticipates that the answer to the question is a
single recipient and therefore the singular speech marker so is used. If the
speaker does not know if the answer will refer to a male or female
recipient, the masculine speech marker so is used. The feminine speech
marker ko is only used if the speaker knows that the recipient of the knife
is a female.","[285, 286, 287, 288]"

1.9 Abau culture
Culture
    The river is viewed as the maternal uncle (kam). It is treated with
respect, because it gives water to wash and drink and it is a source of
food. The ceremonial washing that takes place in the river after an
extended time of mourning is a very important cultural event. The
cleansing water of the river enables the mourner to return to normal life
again.
     Clan ties are strengthened by marriage exchange and by a number of
other customs that involve food exchanges. The most notable among them
is the custom of pig exchange. Many piglets are raised for the benefit of a
member on the maternal side of the family, who lives in expectation of
this gift for many years. The food exchange that takes place when the pig
is eaten is very significant.
Christianity
     The first Christian church workers arrived in the mid-1950s with a
Brethren Church background. Their work in Papua New Guinea was done
under the name CMML. Their main focus was literacy, medical work and
the establishment of village churches. These village churches soon started
to operate under local leadership and were called Christian Brethren
Churches (CBC). Some of the villages further away from the Green River
station have aligned themselves with other churches, e.g. Catholic Church,
Pentecostal Church and ‘Holiness’ Church.
Economy
    The Abau are river people. Their main mode of transport is by canoe.
The vast flat area of swamps, rivers and lakes accounts for their staple of
sago and fish. They can be described as hunters and gatherers, in spite of
the fact that they plant gardens. They tend not to rely heavily on their
gardens, as yearly flooding of the Sepik River often destroys their crops.
    The area depends on air transport for most of its fuel and store-food
supplies. Boat transport along the Sepik is possible but slow and
expensive. Normal village life does not come with a lot of expenses with
the notable exception of the necessity to pay for high school fees. People
have tried a number of cash crops (coffee, rubber in the 1980s, and vanilla
                                                                           13more recently) and none of them proved economically viable, due to low
world market prices and the high costs of air transport to the nearest
coastal town Vanimo.
Education
     In the late fifties, CMML (Christian Missions in Many Lands) started
with their first literacy efforts in Tok Pisin and later also in English among
children and adults. Eventually a primary school in English for children
was established at Green River. This was the only school in the Abau area
till 1974. However, in that year the Idam government station was opened
and the Idam primary school was established. Other primary schools were
gradually added: Yabru (1978), Bifro (1980) Ibru (1982).
    A few more primary schools were established in the late eighties and
nineties (Mukways, Sowkmayon, Kasiaru, Wauru and Wagu). Many of
these remote schools had their share of problems and a few negative
trends had set in. It became increasingly hard to get teachers for these
isolated village schools. Schools became understaffed or the positions
became filled by local teachers who took more liberty in being absent
from their school duties. Most of these schools (with the exception of
Green River) were too small to enroll a new first grade every year. They
only did so every other year or even less frequently. These developments
had a bad effect on the quality of education. Most children are still
enrolled in schools but the drop-out rate has increased.
    A positive development was the establishment of the Green River
High School in the early nineties. This small High School can pride itself
in good academic achievements of its students that got nation-wide
acclamation.
    In 1997 and 1998, Papua New Guinea implemented a dramatic
education reform of its school system. The new set-up promotes the use of
the mother tongue which became the primary language of instruction
within the Elementary School. Oral English is introduced in the last and
third year of Elementary Education. After these three years of Elementary
School the children are enrolled in the third year of Primary School.
Unfortunately, these elementary schools were established in only nine of
the 25 villages. The more remote villages missed out and have asked the
Abau Training Centre for continued assistance to run schools in the
14vernacular until the provincial education office will establish an
Elementary School in their village.
Anthropological research
    Well-documented anthropological research can be found on the site of
The Upper Sepik-Central New Guinea Project (http://www.uscngp.com/
papers). This research group aims “to explore the relationships between
material culture on the one hand, and language, geographical propinquity,
population, subsistence and environment on the other, in two adjacent
regions of Papua New Guinea – the upper Sepik basin and the highlands
of central New Guinea – during a relatively narrow time span before
major impact by foreign cultures.”
     Of special interest is the research of Fyfe and Bolton (2010) with
their analysis of associations between string bag variability, language and
geographical distance in the upper Sepik basin and Border Mountains.
Also noteworthy is the well-written collection of Abau legends by Craig
(1980) and various other articles by the same author. Craig (1980: 8-9)
records a number of local legends which suggest that the Abau speakers
originally moved into the language area from further downstream (east)
along the Sepik.","[25, 26, 27, 28]"
"   Noun incorporation in Abau is indicated by the juxtaposition of an
unmarked object NP with a verb. As Mithun stated the noun is indeed “not
marked for definiteness or number” and occurs without any object
marking that is normally expected for nouns having patient role. In spite
                                                                       115of the close relationship between the unmarked noun and the verb it
precedes, the Abau noun does not become part of the verb phrase as is
further explained below.
    Noun phrases that are frequently zero marked are incorporated nouns
acting as patient. These nouns do not need to be recognised as definite,
unique entities, since the activity the patient is involved in is in focus,
rather than the patient itself. In (164), the nouns naw ‘sago’ and yayh
‘song’ do not need to be recognised as definite, unique entities. The focus
is on the activity that is expressed by the noun in combination with the
verb phrase (‘sago making’ and ‘sing-sing dancing’).
     (164) Hromkwe naw mayr nok, yayh lowk.

            ‘After we did sago-scraping, we did song-drumming (= after
            we scraped sago, we sang/danced songs).’
   In (165), hope ‘tobacco’ and loum ‘burn’ form the general activity
‘smoking’.
    (165) Aio      hiykwe      hope     loum.

           ‘Father is smoking tobacco.’
    In (166), the N V construction wueir meio can be glossed ‘garden
working’. This construction specifies the type of work, namely garden
work; it does not refer to a specific garden. Therefore the noun wueir is
not marked as the object of the clause. In the second clause, the noun
phrase wueir-aiai senkin senkin (various kinds of garden produce) is
marked by the plural objective pronominal marker me, because it refers to
a specific activity in a specified location.

116    In (167), the noun yayh ‘song’ does not refer to a particular song but
combines with the verb to specify a generic activity. However, in (168),
yayh ‘song’ refers to identifiable songs which were practised. Therefore
the noun phrase is marked as the object of the clause.
     (167) Arawh lwak nayr menkin, homkwe yayh lowk nayr.
            arawh lwak nayr menkin hom-kwe yayh lowk nayr

            ‘So the two of them practised those songs together all night.’
    Noun incorporation in Abau is marked by the absence of the object
marker on the NP. The noun is placed as close as possible to the verb
phrase. However, modal and negation markers and interrogatives can
intervene between the noun and the verb phrase. In other words, the noun
and the verb do not combine into a single word, as in the English example
‘berry-picking’ above. In (170), the noun is separated from the verb
phrase by a negation marker, and in (171) by an interrogative.

    In spite of the fact that modal markers and interrogatives may
intervene between a zero marked noun and the verb phrase, Abau
                                                                        117recognises a form of noun incorporation that is manifested by NPs that are
not marked and consist of a single noun. Table 32 gives a number of
examples of noun incorporation that occur so frequently that they behave
as formulaic expressions in Abau. Noun incorporation accounts for most
of the zero marking on noun phrases.","[128, 129, 130, 131]"

    The choice of numeral conveys information that the noun itself cannot
supply. For example, su piron ‘one coconut’ must refer to the whole
coconut palm and not to just the fruit, as the numeral piron indicates the
feature extendedness. In contrast su kamon ‘one coconut’ is likely to be
used when one wants to refer to a single coconut fruit, since the class 2
numeral kamon does not indicate the feature extendedness.
    A noun can be marked by different numeral classifiers on the basis of
different appearance or grouping. The noun pey ‘sugarcane’ can be
marked by four different classes of numeral sets:

    It is unclear where the final -m in sirom originated from. The numerals seys and sompri
     might have sireys and sirompri as underlying forms.

    The numeral classifiers of class 1 modify nouns that are human
beings, including all beings of the spirit world. The main function of
numerals two and three is to establish quantity, as in (45) and (46). The
numeral one is often used to introduce new participants and less often to
ascertain quantity (see §3.4.4.3).

fit any of the other classes
     The numeral classifiers of class 2 count non-human entities, though
these entities can be animate, since nearly all animals belong to this class.
(Certain types of fish belong to another class.)

60    The numerals in this class also count objects which do not
prominently possess any of the features of the other classes described
below. As stated before, the younger generation do not consistently use
the wide range of 12 possible classes but tend to use this class 2 as the
default class for all non-human referents.","[71, 72, 73, 74]"
"3.4.3.3 Class 3 - Small and three-dimensional objects
     The class 3 numeral classifiers modify nouns denoting small objects
which have some volume. This is in contrast with the class 7 numeral
classifiers which modify nouns containing small, mainly two-dimensional
objects. The term ‘small’ refers to entities smaller than a watermelon or
coconut. This class also contains the abstract noun ok ‘talk’, although ok
‘talk’ can also be modified by a class 2 numeral classifier.

that express experience
    This class modifies all tangible nouns that have a flat surface. This
includes nouns with the following glosses: youn ‘mushroom’, iha ‘hand’,
someykiow ‘shoulder’, sey ‘bed’, howk ‘lake’, nweyk ‘ear’. Also a number
of abstract or non-tangible nouns, such as: hay ‘magic’, yayh ‘song’,
prawk ‘scent’, now ‘dream’ and natural phenomena like howniy ‘wind’
and yia ‘fire’. It is hard to posit a common feature that ties these non-
tangible nouns together apart from the fact that they can all be viewed as
impact-making experiences.

            yayh sirom           ‘one song’3.4.3.5 Class 5 - Extendedness
    Class 5 numeral classifiers modify nouns which manifest the feature
extendedness. Included in this group are long objects such as trees and
long pieces of equipment like machetes, spears and paddles, etc.
                                                                           61     (50) yeik piron             ‘one spear’

          yodne pirompri         ‘three fingers’3.4.3.6 Class 6 - Geographical locations
     Class 6 numeral classifiers modify nouns which refer to geographical
entities like garden, mountain, village, and river, and are assigned
masculine gender. Feminine nouns referring to geographical entities (e.g.
howk ‘lake’ and iwa ‘swamp’) have been observed as modified by
numeral classifiers from class 2 and 4.

             yier ureys          ‘two villages’
             yawp urompri        ‘three rivers’3.4.3.7 Class 7 - Two-dimensional
    Class 7 numeral classifiers modify nouns that refer to flat objects
which have very little volume, e.g. paper, various leaves and flowers,
rings or tablets.
      (52) mamey imon          ‘one letter or a sheet of paper’
             nomne ireys       ‘two tablets or two shells’
             huwhay irompri    ‘three flowers’3.4.3.8 Class 8 - Selected trees
     The existing data corpus lists only two nouns that can be modified by
this class 8. Both are relatively short trees that spread out into long leaves
or palm branches at their top. The numerals of these classes refer to the
whole tree.
      (53) yoh limon              ‘one banana tree’
              naw lireys          ‘two sago trees’3.4.3.9 Class 9 - Bundle of long objects (stored)
    Class 9 and 11 are similar, since both refer to countable bundles.
Nouns that are modified by class 9 numerals are bundles of items piled up
at a certain location, but not placed or tied together for the purpose of
transport.
      (54) now-ho einmon        ‘one bundle of piled-up sticks’
            owah eindeys        ‘two bundles of piled-up sago fronds’
623.4.3.10 Class 10 - Temporal
    Only two temporal nouns have been observed to occur with class 10
numerals.
      (55) enekwei leikreys ‘two days’
            eypok leikmon    ‘one daytime’3.4.3.11 Class 11 - Bundle of long objects (transported)
    Similar to the class 9 numerals, the class 11 numerals also modify
nouns that are placed in bundles. When a class 11 numeral is used, these
bundles are tied together (often for the purpose of transport).
      (56) pey hnawrompri ‘three tied-together bundles of sugar cane’3.4.3.12 Class 12 - Pieces or chunks from long objects
    The feature extendedness is prominent in classes 5, 9 and 11, and also
in class 12. Class 12 numerals have one additional characteristic. They
refer to entities that are cut off or broken off chunks or pieces from a
larger item.
     (57)   now-yia howkmon ‘one piece of fire wood’
            pey howkreys    ‘two pieces of sugar cane’
    An object that is a piece from a larger entity that is not characterised
by the feature extendedness cannot be modified by a numeral from this
class. In (58), the NP hopion namon, is referring to a piece of meat that is
basically round and not bigger than the size of a coconut. The choice of
the class 3 numeral places restrictions on the size. The second example
hopion kamon displays a class 2 numeral, which can potentially refer to a
large chunk of pig meat.
      (58) hopion namon          ‘one piece of pig meat’ (class 3 numeral)
             hopion kamon        ‘one part of pig meat’ (class 2 numeral)
3.4.4 Non-quantifying uses of the numeral one3.4.4.1 Introducing participants
    The numeral one is frequently used to introduce new participants in a
story. It encodes indefinite new participants, times and locations. The
numeral one follows the noun it modifies and marks this noun as a new
participant that belongs to a larger group. For example in (59), a
                                                                       63policeman is introduced in the story with the numeral one, to identify him
as a unique individual different from all other members that belong to the
group policemen.
      (59) Enekwei sohokwe                Kupe se          kokwe
            enekwei so-ho-kwe             Kupe s-e         ko-kwe

            ‘At that time Kupe was taken along by a certain policeman.’
     This introductory use of the numeral one is not restricted to human
participants only. Animals, inanimate objects, location, time can all be
introduced with the numeral one.
   In (60), a temporal, a location and an object are all introduced by the
numeral kamon.
     (60) Enekwei kamon hokwe,               aio     hiykwe      kipay

            ‘One day, father went to a certain area and then he saw a
            black palm.’3.4.4.2 Repeated use of the numeral one referring to the same noun
     A participant is introduced only once by the numeral one. If the
numeral is used again in combination with the same noun, the numeral
refers to another member of the same category and should be translated by
‘another’. In (61), the numeral kamon refers to the noun ‘coconut’ (known
from the context). Its repetition in the second clause indicates the
introduction of another coconut.

          ‘I brought one (coconut) with my teeth, and another one down
          with my hand.’3.4.4.3 Numeral one as quantifier
     The numeral one often has the function of introducing new
participants, but it can also simply be a quantifier. The numeral one has a
quantifying function when the numeral is suffixed by -aw ‘restrictive’ as
in (62). The numeral one can be suffixed twice in a row by the suffix -aw.
The second suffix -aw adds emphasis (see §3.1.4). It is best to interpret
prueyn-aw as ‘one’ or ‘just one’ and preyn-aw-aw as ‘only one’.

             ‘Their meat (i.e. the meat of a small bird type) is not much.
             Just one person can eat it.’
     The numeral one also has a quantifying function when it follows a
topicalised NP as in (63). The numeral is not part of the topicalised noun
phrase wik hokwe. The numeral kamon is part of the non-topicalised part

3.4.5 Declining use of the numeral classifier system
    A shift is taking place in the use of numeral classifiers at the expense
of the classes 3 to 12. Many tend to use class 2 numerals to modify all
non-human nouns. Table 20 gives examples of differing observed usages
of the numerals by speakers of the language. The second column gives
‘non-standard’ usage observed in younger speakers.","[74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79]"
"    When the non-personal interrogative functions as subject, it is
obligatorily copied by a personal subject pronoun suffixed with -kwaw.
The marker -kwaw is analysed as the restrictive marker (see §3.1.4). In
combination with the non-human interrogative it can be translated as
‘what in particular’. In (110), hiykwaw follows the interrogative pay:

            ‘As to the two of them, what thing appeared to them (= what

     In (111), the interrogative pay functions as the object of the clause and
is therefore followed by the object marker se.
     (111) Hiykwe              hane    pay       se          kow

             ‘What did he give me?’
    In verbless clauses the interrogative is pay. The speech marker
following in (112) functions on sentence level and corresponds in gender
and number with the topic noun phrase ai hokwe.
     (112) Ai      hokwe,       pay       so?

            ‘As for this food, what is it?’
     The non-personal interrogative can be followed by the comitative non,
the locative mon or the exact locative sok, as can be seen from the column
which lists NPs with postpositional markers. No number and gender
distinctions occur in these postpositional constructions.

    The three location interrogatives in this section poho, pokwo and
pomo are used exclusively as the comment constituent in verbless
questions. They are frequently used to seek information about the location
of an entity (114).
    (114) Hno         uwr poho? Hiykwe                 a       mon lwak.

    Location is always the focus, except when one wants information
about a person’s name. This is an interesting exception. Names in the
local culture form a major part of a person’s identity and their use (and
especially non-use) is controlled by many cultural customs. It is not
always appropriate to directly ask a person’s name. It is possible that these
cultural sensitivities have influenced the form of questions about names.
    Example (116) contains a request to give name identification.
    (116) Hno       uru     poho? Hano         uru    hokwe       John.
          hwon-o uru        po-ho han-o uru           ho-kwe      John

          ‘What is your name? My name is John.’
7.5.2 The interrogative as nominal modifier
    A number of interrogatives may precede the head of the NP. In that
position they classify the head phrase for categories as location, kind,
manner, uniqueness etc. The interrogative forms together with the noun it
precedes a unified stress unit. This stress unit is exceptional in the sense
that the interrogative takes the initial stress within the NP. This stress
contour is somewhat similar to the stress contour over compound nouns,
278where the initial noun always has the primary stress, even when the first
noun within the compound noun modifies the second.
   The following interrogatives can take the role of modifier within the
noun phrase.
   pay     – non-human entity identification
   poso – human entity identification
   perey – location identification
   penkin – manner identification
   pohiy, pohok, pohom – request identification in contrast to other
       known entities (§7.5.2.1)
    In (117), pay precedes the head of the NP and displays a very
prominent stress and forms with the noun it modifies one unified stress
unit. The interrogative is used to ascertain a certain subset of the entity it
modifies.
     (117) Ahney sohokwe,                pay       ahney so?
             ahney so-ho-kwe             po-ay ahney so

             ‘As for that bird, what (kind of) bird is it? We heard it just
             now in the morning.’
    The interrogative poso can be a modifier in a NP preceding the head of
the noun phrase as is exemplified in (118) and (119). The interrogative
poso is not an embedded NP marked for genitive case here as is true for
(106) and (107). In a genitive construction two entities are compared with
each other: the owner and the owned. In the examples below, however,
there is only one entity within the NP whose identity is enquired after by
means of the modifying interrogative.
                                                                       279    (118) Hano owk,             'poso uwr hiykwaw          huor

    (119) Uwrsa          serey        ma lwak mokwe,

          Q-HUM man-woman Q.SP.PFTV.PL
           ‘Those people over there, what people (or: who) are they?’
    The intonation contour for poso functioning as a genitive interrogative
and for poso functioning as an interrogative modifier differs greatly. In
(118) and (119), the interrogative poso takes the most prominent stress (as
indicated by ') and the noun following has secondary stress. In (120), poso
is a genitive interrogative and has therefore a less prominent stress than
the noun owk ‘string bag’ it precedes.
     (120) Owk            sokukwe,          poso
             owk          so-ko-kwe         po-so-o

             string.bag Q.SP.PFTV.F
             ‘As for this string bag, whose string bag is it?’
   Usually the interrogative modifier follows rather than precedes the
noun it modifies. In (121), the location interrogative perey is used as a
modifier in the NP yier perey mon.
    (121) Hokwe         'yier perey     mon lwak o?
             hok-kwe yier po-rey mon lwak o
             3S.F-TOP place Q-place LOC be           Q.SP.IPFTV
             ‘At what location is she?’
    In (122), penkin occurs as a modifier within the NP peik penkin non.
280      (122) Hai, uwr sohokwe,               'peik po-enkin non
            hai uwr so-ho-kwe               peik    penkin   non

            so
            Q.SP.PFTV.M
            ‘As for that man, what kind of sickness has he?’
    The modifier penkin can also precede the noun it modifies. In (123), it
takes over the primary stress from the noun is modifies.
    (123) Hai, uwr sohokwe                   'po-enkin peik
             hai uwr so-ho-kwe               penkin      peik

             CMT Q.SP.PFTV.M
             ‘As for that man, what kind of sickness has he?’
      There seems to be no semantic difference between (122) and (123).","[288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294]"
"1.10 Acknowledgements
    This current grammar write-up is based on research conducted by me
over a period of more than 20 years under the auspices of the Papua New
Guinea Branch of SIL International. My wife and I learned to speak the
language, collected stories and studied the local culture. We were able to
involve a large number of Abau speakers in the establishment of the
current orthography and in the development of a three year curriculum in
the vernacular for the 25 Abau speaking villages along the Sepik River.
The vast majority of the examples in this grammar paper have been taken
from a corpus of non-elicited texts of 85,000 words.
    We want to thank the Yabru community for allowing us to live among
them since September 1982. We especially thank our friends and fellow-
workers Obow Inaru and Alex Nomben, who, along with many others,
have helped us to gain many valuable insights into the language.
    A special word of thanks goes to our colleagues within SIL whose
encouragement and input have been essential in gaining insights in the
                                                                      15structure of the Abau language. I want to thank Bob Conrad not only for
his assistance in producing the Abau Grammar essentials in 1985
(unpublished manuscript) but also for his willingness to be one of the
editors in the final stages of the current document. Secondly, I want to
thank the late Cindi Farr for her enthusiasm and keen insights into how
information is marked for relative prominence within Abau texts. A major
part of this paper was finished under her supervision in 1999.
    In 2007, I was encouraged to make the research available to the wider
public. SIL colleague Ian Tupper probed me with many questions about
the wording of certain sections that needed further work. He also kindly
gave me many suggestions and editorial comments for the other sections. I
believe they have improved the overall clarity of this grammar. Thanks
are also due to Lisa Halverson who did a fine job in preparing the
manuscript for publication, John Carter who produced two of the maps,
several people in Ukarumpa who did the final proofreading and René van
den Berg who oversaw the whole process as series editor.
   Lastly, I want to thank my wife Maija for her encouragement and
support. The current grammar write-up does not reflect sufficiently the
many warm and meaningful friendships she helped to develop with our
Abau friends.
                   2. Phonology    This chapter presents a brief outline of the phonology of Abau,
including phonemes and allophones. It gives some background on the
vowel analysis which is called for in light of the fact that various
researchers have come up with different vowel inventories. It also deals
with the topics stress, syllable and word structure and morphophonemics.
The phonology of Abau is only summarised here. For a more detailed
write-up, see Lock (2007).
    The phonological system of Abau is based on fourteen phonemes:
nine consonants and five vowels.","[28, 29, 30]"
"7.5.1.2 Non-human interrogative functioning as head of the NP
    The non-human interrogative is pay ‘what’, derived from with the
interrogative prefix po- and the suffix -ay. (Vowel syncope rule:
VoØ/_V# )
     This question word is used to seek to establish the identity of non-
human entities which includes animals (but not spirits) and all non-
animate nouns. The interrogative is marked for gender and number by a
separate pronoun or marker following the interrogative. The interrogative
can be followed by some of the postpositional markers or by a pronoun
that is syntactically marked for object and subject.",[288]

4.3.2 Qualifier
    The word qualifier is chosen to describe adverbial constituents. They
are not verbs themselves, but can intervene between true verbs. (A true
verb is here defined as a verb that can host a verbal prefix.) This group of
qualifiers can be further differentiated into free and bound qualifiers.
Bound qualifiers have to co-occur with a very limited number of verbs.
Their distribution is therefore very restricted. Free qualifiers, on the other
hand, can qualify nearly all verbs and can even intervene between verbs.","[154, 155]"
"4.3.1.1 Morphophonemic processes within the verb phrase
    Some morphophonemic changes take place exclusively within verbs
and become therefore a means to distinguish verbs from other members of
                                                                             139the verb phrase. More than half of the Abau verbs start with the phoneme
l. A deletion rule (§2.6.1) affects all verbs starting with the phoneme l
unless the verb occurs VP initially in which case it retains the phoneme l.
    In (21), the first verb lyawriy ‘enter’ triggers the initial l-deletion rule,
changing the subsequent verbs liwak ‘sit’ and lira ‘see’ to iwak and ira.
      (21) Hunkwe     hano      kamara se          lyawriy iwak

           ‘Come in and sit down and look at my camera.’
    The l-deletion rule applies to all verbs except the initial one.
     (22) Hromkwe mu                   me      ley anio okin a.

            ‘We went and walked and hit (= killed) and ate crocodiles.’
    The sentence in (23) consists of two clauses with two underlined VPs.
Every initial verb retains its word initial <l>. The VP initial lyawriy ‘enter’
and lanio ‘walk’ do not undergo changes, but lira ‘see’ is reduced to ira
by the deletion rule because it does not occur verb phrase initially.
      (23) Homkwe lyawriy nok, lanio ira, uwrsa

    In this paper a VP with a sequence of verbs is not analysed as a serial
verb phrase with several heads, but as having a compound verb as its
head. The criteria distinguishing the head of the VP lend themselves to a
compound analysis.
140      1. Prefixes only occur with the first verb in the series.
      2. Other than the first verb, all verbs in the series undergo the
         morphophonemic process of l-deletion.
      3. One intonational pattern without pauses dominates the entire
         string. The first verb receives the highest pitch in the intonation
         contour.
      4. Other than an intervening qualifier, the head is an uninterrupted
         unit of 1-4 verbs within a VP that has definite pre-head and post-
         head constituents that modify the unitary head.","[152, 153, 154]"

10                MAP 3: ABAU AND NEIGHBOURING LANGUAGES
    The languages which border the Abau language area are unrelated and
show minimal affiliation between each other. The proximity of these
languages is illustrated by the fact that practically all these language
groups have at least one village community which is located within a
day’s walking distance from the Green River Government Station.
Starting near the Indonesian border and going clockwise around the Abau
language the following eight neighbouring languages are found (see
map 3):
    Karkar-Yuri (pop. 1400) – north-west from Green River Station all
the way to the Indonesian border; was formerly thought to be an isolate,
but is now known to be a member of the Pauwasi family (Lewis 2009).
    Angor (pop. 1200) – north of Green River with majority of villages
around Amanab; together with Dera a member of the Senagi family, and
not currently considered to be closely related to any other languages (Ross
2005).
    Nai (pop. 750) – also referred to as Biaka; three village communities
between Green River Station and Amanab; related to Kwomtari; 30%
cognate (Loving and Bass 1964; Baron 1983).
                                                                                      11    Odiai (pop. 250) – also known as Busa; three village communities
located Northeast of Green River, west of the Horden River; isolate
(Lewis 2009).
    Yale (Yalë) (pop. 700) – also referred to as Nagatiman; located 30
kilometres northeast of the Green River Station between the Horden and
Senu Rivers; isolate (Lewis 2009).
   Amto (pop. 250) – also known as Ki; located in Rocky Peak Districts;
Amto-Musan language family (Lewis 2009).
   Siawi (pop. 300) – also known as Musan; located toward the
headwaters of the Left May River on the Samaia River east of Amto;
Amto-Musan language family (Lewis 2009).
    Pyu (pop. 100) – only one village community, known as Biak 2 (Biak
1 is an Abau speaking village); located near the Indonesian Border and
along the Biak River, a tributary of the Sepik River (Laycock 1973;
Conrad and Dye 1975). Laycock (1973) suggested that Pyu is related to
Kwomtari, but Baron (1983) found no evidence for this.
    According to some sources (e.g. Laycock 1973; Lewis 2009), Yetfa
(Biksi) also has speakers on the Papua New Guinean side of the border,
west from the Abau language area. This was based on survey word lists
from Biak 2 village, where the primary language is Pyu. The women
surveyed had married into Biak 2 from a Yetfa-speaking village on the
Indonesian side of the border, as documented in articles on the language
by Laycock (1972), and Conrad & Dye (1975). 3 My own travels and
surveys did not lend any support to the claim that there are mother-tongue
Yetfa speakers in Papua New Guinea apart from those who have settled in
Biak 2 as a result of marriage exchange.
   Namia, located east from Green River, belongs the Sepik language
family but is too far away to be considered a geographic neighbour. The
same is true for the Suganga (West-Miamin), located in the south, since
none of their village communities is found close to any Abau speaking
communities.","[23, 24, 25]"
"8.1     Defining topic
    Topic or givenness (which often implies definiteness) in Abau is
marked by -kwe and refers to all information that the speaker assumes is
present or readily accessible in the addressee’s consciousness. Chafe
(1976:30) defines givenness and the problems related to this choice of
terminology this way.
        Given (or old) information is that knowledge which the
        speaker assumes to be in the consciousness of the
        addressee at the time of the utterance. So-called new
                                    291
292         information is what the speaker assumes he is introducing
         into the addressee’s consciousness by what he says. The
         terminology has been and continues to be misleading to
         linguists and psychologists who use it. Calling something
         ‘old information’ suggests it is ‘what the listener is
         expected to know already’ and ‘new information’ is ‘what
         the listener is not expected to know already,’ something
         that is being introduced into the addressee’s knowledge
         for the first time… But a speaker who says ‘I saw your
         father yesterday’ is unlikely to assume that the addressee
         had no previous knowledge of his father, even though by
         the usual criteria your father would be considered new
         information. The point is that the speaker has assumed
         that the addressee was not thinking about his father at the
         moment. Terms like ‘already activated’ and ‘newly
         activated’ would convey this distinction more accurately,
         but are awkward; we will probably have to live with the
         terms ‘given’ (or ‘old’) and ‘new’.
    In Abau, the topic marker -kwe marks information that the speaker
presents as background information, whether or not the addressee has
ready access to it. Constituents marked by the topic marker -kwe occur
sentence initially. The topicalised constituents form together the setting or
the background against which the rest of the predication is asserted. This
topic part sets the stage for the rest of the predication. Participants and
props are mentioned as part of this stage setting. The comment part of the
sentence expresses new information.","[305, 306]"

164     Earlier research acknowledges the existence of verb phrase final
intonation, but explained the variations as tense distinctions rather than an
aspect difference. Bailey (1975:36-37) states that “verbs exhibit
grammemic tone” and “in some constructions tone is the minimal
difference that indicates past or present tense.” Lock (2007:23) comments
that, “(i)t has not been conclusively established that the different tone on
the final verb marks the difference between past and present tense”. In this
paper the difference in intonation contour is analysed as the difference
between imperfective (IPFTV) and perfective (PFTV) and these terms (and
associated abbreviations) are used throughout.
     The distinctive intonation contour mainly occurs on the last
constituent of a verb phrase that is not followed by a clause-final marker
(see §5.1.2). The verb phrase intonation over the final syllable of the VP is
a very salient feature and sets the imperfective apart from the perfective.
The perfective is indicated by a flat, relatively low single pitch on the final
syllable of the verb phrase. The imperfective is indicated by a rising and
falling pitch, also on the final syllable of the verb phrase. The two aspects
are symbolised by diacritics over the VP final vowel: the symbol ^ for the
imperfective as in (1), and ` for the perfective as in (2).
        (1) Hakwe yier          mon lêy.

             1S.TOP village LOC go.PFTV
             ‘I went to the village’
    The imperfective often overlaps with the present and the past. This is
not always the case as is demonstrated in (3) and (4).

follows a clause with the sequential marker nok, as in (3) above. (For
more discussion see §9.5.4.)

            ‘I have finished a lot of work.’
    For more discussion on the perfect marker po, see §5.2.6.
5.1.1 Other features of the VP final intonation
    When one compares the intonation contour over the two syllable verb
lokin ‘hit’ in (5) and (6), the contrast between imperfective and perfective
stands out because of the final syllable. But it should be noted that there is
also a smaller difference in the pitch on the onset of the first syllable of
lokin. It is somewhat more salient and higher in (5) than in (6). (The
contrast is symbolised by markings over the initial vowel of the verb,
whereby ьrepresents a higher onset than ы)
    The difference in pitch might be simply a natural tone adjustment in
anticipation of the more contrastive pitch difference on the final syllable.
In this paper, only the verb phrase final pitch on the final syllable is
marked in those examples where the distinction between perfective and
imperfective is relevant.

5.1.2 Post VP marking of the perfective and imperfective
     Clause-final markers which distinguish morphologically between
perfective and imperfective are discussed in §7. A number of other clause-
final markers which have their own distinct intonation contours do not
distinguish between perfective and imperfective. In §7.1 and §7.2 the
objective marker e in imperatives and the future markers a, ane and aney
are discussed. Another set of clause-final modal markers that express
166other aspects like inchoative, intention, desirability and dubitative are
discussed in §5.3. All these markers in §7 and §5.3 follow the verb phrase
and have their own distinctive intonation contours which neutralise any
contrastive intonation that might have been on the final syllable of the
verb phrase.
    A quick overview of the clause-final markers which distinguish
morphologically between perfective and imperfective is given in Table 39
below. These clause-final markers follow the VP. Many of these markers
are only distinguished in modality by intonation. Further discussion and
examples, including a description of what intonation contours the
diacritics stand for, can be found in the sections as indicated in the table.","[177, 178, 179, 180]"

verb phrase
5.2.1 Deontic modality markers kwa, kwaw and ka
     The deontic modal markers kwa, kwaw, and ka express deontic
modality, which includes a wide semantic range: hortative, permissive,
and imperative. In example (7), kwa marks an imperative. Verb phrases
marked by the hortative marker kwa always display perfective aspect. (In
all the examples in chapter 5, the relevant VP is always underlined and the
marker under discussion is bolded.)

   Like the English phrase ‘please, sit down’, kwa signals a polite
command in (8). The intent of the speaker is to grant permission.

          ‘Men, please sit and wait (here), I will first go back to my

          In (9), the speaker entreats the people to listen well.

          ‘Men, I am your member (= leader), each one of you please

     Speakers use kwaw ‘HOR.RSTR’ to make their command or permission
the exclusive, single issue that needs to be focused on. It is used in
contexts where the purpose is to make an earnest request rather than give
a command. The underlying form consists of the hortative marker kwa and
the restrictive marker -aw.

    The marker of dynamic modality1 liy encodes an evaluation of the
subject’s potential or ability. In (14) liy ‘DYN’ indicates potential.

    This paper uses the terms PERFECTIVE and PERFECT and they should not be
    confused. The perfect (PFT) encodes what is variously described as a past action with
    present relevance or a present state resulting from a past action. The perfective ( PFTV)
    aspect refers to a single event conceived as one complete unit. (This in contrast to the
    imperfective aspect which represents an event in the process of unfolding or a repeated
    or habitual event.) See also Comrie (1976:65) where he states that a verb can be both
    perfect and imperfective.
                                                                        175     (29) Nwoh piaparaw kamon hye                po peyk

The marker po ‘PFT’ is not a tense marker, but an aspectual marker that
signals perfect. In (30), po co-occurs with o. The latter is a speech marker
that indicates imperfective aspect, which is often used to signal current or
ongoing events. (These speech utterance markers are discussed in §7.4.)

In (31), the marker po ‘PFT’ expresses a state or condition that continues
to hold true or with continuing results. The intonation over the verb lwak
‘be’ signals the imperfective.

    It is noteworthy that the aspect marker po can occur within a clause
that is marked for perfective. When po occurs in the apodosis of a
176counterfactual condition (32), the final VP intonation is low, which marks
perfective. This construction is further discussed in §5.2.8.

5.2.7 Imminent and indefinite future
    Two discontinuous morphemes which mark imminent and indefinite
action are: po … a ‘imminent future’ and ya … a ‘indefinite future’. The
marker po is used in other contexts as well (see §5.2.6) and the different
usages of the marker po are summarized in §5.2.8.1.
    When po ‘IMM.FUT’ co-occurs with the clause-final indefinite future
marker a, it encodes immediate future. The marker a ‘FUT’ is not part of
the verb phrase. It is a clause-final marker that carries an intonation that is
different from VP final intonation contour for the perfective and the
imperfective. It is somewhat similar to the intonation for the imperfective
but nevertheless different, since the pitch over the future action marker is
higher and the change in pitch is less salient. It is only a gradual small fall

Similarly, phrase initial ya, meaning indefinite future, always co-occurs
with phrase terminal a. See (35) and (36).

   The current hypothesis is that po in these contexts is derived from
pokon ‘today, future’3 and that ya is derived from yaw ‘tomorrow’. Both
po and ya have grammaticalised into aspectual-relative time markers
which together with verb phrase final a ‘Future’ express the concepts of
imminent future and indefinite future.

    It should be noted that the future marker a, when it does not co-occur
with the two aspect markers po ‘imminent future’ and ya ‘indefinite
future’, is only observed in interrogatives (see §7.2). In contrast,3
    This po is homophonous with po ‘COMPLETIVE’. See §5.2.8.1 for all uses of po.
178constructions formed with po …a and ya … a are used exclusively in
affirmative sentences.
5.2.8 Counterfactual
    When po is followed by a VP marked for the perfective it marks
counterfactual (CFT). In (37) an unmet hypothetical condition is followed
by a counterfactual clause.
      (37) Sawk hiykwe           nioh ley         lowpway hokwe,

            3S.M-TOP CFT die.PFTV
            ‘If he had lost all his blood, he would have died.’
    The marker po co-occurs with the imperfective and the perfective.
When po co-occurs with a VP marked for imperfective it marks an event
that happened in the past but continues to have its effect on the present
(38). When po co-occurs with a VP marked for the perfective it marks an
event that would have taken place in the past but did not (39).
      The verb phrase in (38) is marked for the imperfective.

34   Pragmatic marking is realised with the help of the topic marker -kwe
which cannot occur by itself, but is always suffixed to a pronoun.
    The NP final marking not only marks the NP for its syntactic, semantic
and/or pragmatic role, but in most cases also reflects the gender and/or
number of the head of the NP. Many of these markers are also affixed for
demonstrative force. These demonstratives need to be explained against
the background of their counterparts which do not have deictic force. For
that reason the demonstratives are not in one section but are discussed in
various sections. The manner demonstrative in §3.5.5, the non-syntactic
demonstrative in §3.6.2, the syntactic demonstrative in §3.8.
Summary overview of Chapter 3:
    It basically describes the structure and function of nouns and noun
phrases. It includes sections on the form and use of personal pronouns
(§3.1); the form, use and gender of the noun (§3.2, §3.3); numerals (§3.4)
and adjectives (§3.5). An extensive overview of all pragmatic (§3.6),
syntactic (§3.7, §3.8) and semantic (§3.9) noun phrase markers. The
chapter concludes with a full discussion of the structure of the noun
phrase (§3.10) and the absence of NP marking (§3.11).","[47, 48]"
"6.2     Verbless clauses
    Verbless clauses can be divided in two basic parts:
    1. one or more noun phrases marked by topic markers
       hosting -kwe,
    2. an obligatory complement constituent functioning as the
       comment. The comment constituent never hosts -kwe.
    These two parts are separated by a short, but clear pause. The first part
consisting of topicalsed constituents is the given setting or the background
against which the comment is made. The comment constituent contains
the new information that the speaker wants to convey.",[202]
