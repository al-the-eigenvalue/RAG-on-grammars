        Typologically it is a common phenomenon that rigid word order and lack of morphological case
    markings occur together in a language. This is especially common in SVO-languages like Urim.
    Urim does not have any case marking morphology on either the subject or object, nor is there any
    agreement marked on the verb either. Since there is no morphological way to mark which noun
    phrase in the clause is subject and which is object, the syntactic position of the noun phrase before or
    after the verb is what shows its syntactic function. Not only the subject and transitive object are
    unmarked, but also all other obligatory arguments of a verb are morphologically unmarked. This
    increases the importance of word order for delineating the functions of NPs in the clause. The
    following examples illustrate how a change of word order changes the meaning of clauses and even
    the clause type:
           (25a)   Kupm      wan             itna.
                   1sg       house           stand.R
                   ‘I have a house.’                                     (possessive clause)           (25b)   Kupm          itna             wan.
                   1sg           stand.R          house
                   ‘I stand in the house.’                               (locative clause)           (26a)   Melnum      nikg              alm -pel.
                   man         stomach          hit.R-3sg.O
                   ‘The man is hungry.’                                  (experience clause)
           (26b)   Melnum      alm -pel           nikg
                                                                                                    170               man        hit.R-3sg.O     stomach
               ‘The man hit him in the stomach.’                    (transitive clause)
    Urim has been classified as a Papuan language, stock level isolate in the Torricelli Phylum.. The
question of isolation can be re-considered when some of the neighbouring languages have been
studied in more detail. All Torricelli languages display some similarities with Austronesian
languages: fixed SVO word order, lack of medial verbs, use of transitivity-changing suffixes and
realis-irrealis mood, etc. It seems that Urim has these non-Papuan features to a greater extent than
many other Torricelli languages. It lacks subject-agreement on the verb, and is also in other respects
morphologically simpler than the other Torricelli phylum languages.","[169, 170]"
"
    Torricelli phylum languages have been thought to be basically Papuan languages which have been
subjected to heavy Austronesian influence. There are some Austronesian languages along the north
coast. Word order is one of the Austronesian features in the Torricelli language group, since Papuan
languages usually are SOV- languages. It is a common theory that SVO- languages often have
developed from earlier SOV-languages either through the influence of some neighbouring SOV-
languages or from language internal reasons. One of these reasons could be the disappearance of
morphological case-marking, which in a way forces the language to rely on the word order in marking
these functions. (Givón 1979a 145-146). If a language were to change its word order from SOV to
SVO, it would be expected that there would be some residues from the former SOV-type structure.
The more recent this change has been, the more residues would be expected. Word order change
most commonly starts from the main-clause level, and later spreads into more complex structures.
According to Givón (1984:220-228). “the longer a language has maintained a rigid OV or VO word
order, the more it is likely to bear out Greenberg’s predictions (1966).” If this is true, then Urim has
been SVO-language at least during the last two thousand years, since it is an unusually pure SVO-
language following all the predictions that Greenberg mentions. All modifiers of the noun phrase and
almost the entire verb phrase occur after the head. There are suffixes, but this is quite a common
feature in SVO-languages in general, and not a strong indicator of a recent change of word order.
Most commonly the residue of the presumed word order would occur in dependent and embedded
clauses and other structures like nominalizations and idioms. But in Urim these have SVO-word
order, except when the subject referent is generic:
       (27)   Kil    ariwe    hapm        angkut.
              3sg    know.R cloth         sew.R
              ‘She knows how to sew.’
    This is the only observed possible residue of a former SOV-word order. Assuming this theory is
right Urim is an almost ideal SVO-language typologically. One could perhaps question if it were
easier to derive a language like Urim from an Austronesian group having some heavy Papuan
                                                                                                 171
influences than the other way around? But this and the whole question of the classification of Urim
needs much more work before any definite answers or even suggestions can be given.
                                                                                                          172                               5. Complex sentences        Usually three types of subordinate clauses are distinguished in languages: those which function as
    arguments of the predicate (i.e. complements), those which function as modifiers of nouns (relative
    clauses), and those which function as modifiers of verb phrases or entire propositions (adverbial
    clauses). (Thompson and Longacre, 171). We can find these clause types also in Urim, although with
    adverbial clauses it is difficult to distinguish between subordinated adverbial clauses and more
    coordinate combinations of clauses. Therefore we conflate the description of adverbial clauses and
    coordinate combinations of sentences.","[170, 171, 172]"
"4.7. Typological Considerations
        In summary, some clear tendencies can be seen. First, SVO word order occurs in all clause types.
    Urim is a very consistent and rigid SVO-language. In particular, the position of subject is very fixed.
    In most clause types it cannot be moved after the verb or anywhere else. In certain intransitive
    clauses this is possible, but not very common. Also the position of locative object and topic is quite
    rigid. In transitive clauses the second argument, object, is easily fronted for thematic reasons. There
    is not so much danger of mixing the grammatical functions of subject and object in transitive clause,
    because the transitive subject always is the more animate and agent-like referent in the clause. As
    we have seen, the transitive subject is almost exclusively agent, and if not, this is shown by the
    structure of the clause.",[169]
"4.5.2.   Descriptive Clause
       The predicate of a descriptive clause differs from the predicate of an equative clause in that it is
  non-referential. It only qualifies and describes the subject-referent. The predicate can either be a
  nominal phrase as in an equative clause, or an adjectival phrase. The word order is inflexible - the
  result would be either unintelligible or an equative clause with different meaning. The subject is
  almost always definite and therefore marked by the demonstrative pa, or a pronoun (22c). Without
  this demonstrative the clause would look like an attributive noun phrase. Compare the following two
  examples:         (21a)   Melnum         pa          wor.
                 man            D           good
                 ‘The man      is good/well.’
         (21b)   Melnum         wor
                 man            good
                 ‘A good man’
                                                                                                         166    Other examples of descriptive clauses:
           (22a)   Namung       pa       okopma wor.
                   banana       D        food   good
                   ‘Banana is good food.’
           (22b)   Pa      melnum       manet       ur.
                   that    man          other       ID
                   ‘That is a special kind of man indeed.’           (22c)   Tingkorin    kil        melnum,         Ariyek    kil         wampung.
                   Tingkorin    3sg        man             Ariyek    3sg         tree kangaroo
                   ‘Tingkorin was a man, Ariyek was a tree kangaroo.’
           (22d)   Ale     wan          akwap       pa       a      kipman.
                   build,R house        work        D        G      man
                   ‘House-building is men’s work.’
           (22e)   Ti     ake   kar      a      awi    melnum         pa,     ti     kar     a   akwap
                   this   not   car      G      take.R man            D       this   car     G   work
                   ‘This is not a bus, this is a truck!’4.6. Topic Clauses
        The notion of ‘topic’ is basically a textual notion, not a syntactic function in the clause. In Urim
    textual topics and left dislocations are a very common discourse device. Some of these sentential
    topics seem to have been lexicalized into fixed, obligatory parts of certain types of clauses. The status
    of these as basic clause types is somewhat marginal the same kind of topicalization structures also
    occur as productive discourse devices. Nevertheless, it seems that certain verbs in Urim require an
    obligatory argument, which can be called topic. Li-Thompson calls these kinds of structures ‘double-
    subject constructions’ (Li 1975: 481). The name conveys the idea that in these constructions the
    prototypical features of subject have been split into two constituents: topic and grammatical subject.
    Subject is prototypically what the clause is about and also the actor in control in transitive clauses-
    especially so in Urim (see section 6.4.4). If there is a lack of control in the situation expressed by a
    transitive clause, there are usually also some changes in the morphosyntax of the clause. One of these
    changes is to move the agent to the clause initial topic position and promote some other referent into
    the grammatical subject. In Urim culture certain types of actions are always considered to be outside
    of the control of the person involved. Emotions and sensations, as well as most sicknesses are
    expressed by verb frames requiring topic arguments. Possession is considered not fully controlled by
                                                                                                                          167
  the individual possessor, and for this reason also possessive clauses are topic clauses.9 In topic clauses
  both nominal constituents, topic and subject, precede the verb when it is present, but the verb itself
  may be omitted too.
4.6.1.     Possessive Clause
      In the possessive clause the semantic possessor occurs in topic position and the possessed item
  occurs as grammatical subject. This is thematically consistent with the normal ordering of
  information in the clause, since the referent of the possessor is usually given information, and the
  thing possessed is new information. Since there is no agreement morphology on the verb to show
  which NP is the grammatical subject, only word order and semantic content reveal it. The word order
  seems to be fixed; the topic and the subject cannot change places in the clause. One example was
  found where the subject appeared to occur between the two parts of an appositional topic noun phrase
  (23e). The possessor is usually animate, and most often human. Possessive clause may have a verb
  denoting the position of the possessed object. There are both verbal and verbless possessive clauses,
  but positive possessive clauses are more frequently verbal. The verb seems to be obligatory if there
  is another nominal constituent in the clause. Possessive clauses structurally resemble three other
  clause types: equative clauses (23b), existence clauses (23e) and locative clauses (23a).
          (23a)     Melnum        pa      hi       itna    wam.
                    man           D       sore     stand.R hand
                    ‘The man has a sore in the hand.’
          (23b)     Kil           kiin              wekg.
                    3sg           woman             two
                    ‘He has two wifes.’
          (23c)     melnum       ur     pa       wan   okipma watipmen.
                    person       ID     D        house food   plenty
                    ‘A certain man has plenty food in his house.’
                     or: ‘There is a man with plenty food in his house’
          (23d)     Kupm           wan              kalpis-en.
                    1sg            house            not-ATR
                    ‘I have no house.’
          (23e)     Kitn           nerkgiin         Klimanglen       kalpis.
                    2sg            gardenland       Klimanglen       not
                    ‘You Klimanglen have no garden land (here).’
  9 Foster (in Plank 1979) discusses the notion of possession in different cultures and how it affects the structure of
  possessive clauses.
                                                                                                                            168
      The possessive clause is negated differently from most other clause types. Instead of the usual
  negative particle ake the nominal negative word kalpis is used and there is no verb.10 Elsewhere,
  only existence clauses are negated in this way (see Section 6.3.2). There are two other features shared
  between existence clauses and possessive clauses: 1) use of the same verbs, and 2) the existence of
  verbless variants. It might be possible to derive some types of possessive clause from an existence
  clause or a locative clause by adding a topic, but the structure is fully grammaticalized and the topic is
  obligatory.
4.6.2.     Experience Clause
      The topic of an experience clause is also always animate and semantically an experiencer. The
  grammatical subject is usually either a body part, where the feeling etc. is located, or an inanimate
  referent which is the cause of the feeling or the object of wanting etc. The only common features
  such clauses exhibit are: 1) the semantic meaning of involuntary experience, and 2) the presence of an
  obligatory topic constituent before the grammatical subject. Most experience clauses have a bound
  object pronoun which is coreferential with the topic (24a), (24d), but this pronoun can be absent,
  especially if the grammatical subject is a body part of the experiencer (24b), (24c).
      The experience clauses with body parts differ structurally from genitive constructions, which are
  always of the form Npossessed + a + Ngenitive (wam a melnum ‘man’s hand’) when the possessor is
  specific (see section 3.1.4).
          (24a)     Kupm        hu         wak-opm.
                    1sg         water      ?-1sg.O
                    ‘I am thirsty.’
          (24b)     Kupm        ake        num       wakget,       kalpis.
                    1sg         not        skin      hot           not
                    ‘I do not have fever.’
          (24c)     Kupm         ok               kark(-opm).
                    1sg          mouth            afraid(-1sg.O)
                    ‘I feel nauseated’          (24d)     Kitn     yaprekg       paipm-en-tetn?
                    2sg      breath        bad-ATR-2sg.O
                    ‘Are you out of breath?’
  10 Although no instances of possessive clauses having the negative word ake have been found thus far, it remains a
  possibility that such a construction could exist. If this were to be the case, clauses negated with ake might have a slightly
  different meaning (perhaps having to do with scope of negation) than those negated with kalpis.
                                                                                                          169
       In contrast to the possessive clause, the experience clause is normally negated using the verbal
    negator ake.","[165, 166, 167, 168, 169]"
"                            6. About Urim Discourse
6.1. Word Order Variations and Dislocations
         Word order in Urim is basically very rigid. Since there are hardly any morphological means to
    distinguish core arguments like Subject, Object, Locative Object and Second Object, they are solely
    marked by their position. For this reason the core constituents cannot move very freely in the clause
    for thematic reasons. Subjects almost always occur before the verb in Urim clause. Objects can be
    fronted, but this is still comparatively rare in Urim.",[242]

4.1. Introduction and Chart of Clause Types
        The clause is the basic syntactic unit occurring between the phrase and the sentence.1 When
    describing the clauses of a language, it is important to clearly distinguish between the notions of text
    clause and basic or kernel clause. Text clauses consist of both nuclear and peripheral elements, and
    quite often some of the nuclear elements are not present in the clause if they are known from the
    textual context or environmental context or are part of the semantic content of the verb. A basic
    clause consists of nuclear elements only and is a ‘perfect’ or ‘full’ clause in the sense that it does not
    have any elided constituents and it can be understood without a text context. Generative grammar
    defines kernel clauses or sentences as being minimal in the sense that they cannot be derived from
    other clauses. This excludes passive, imperative, interrogative etc. types from basic clause types.
    (Lyons 1979, Givon 1984)
        Nuclear elements of the clause are the predicate, which is usually a verb, and its obligatory or core
    arguments. In nonverbal clauses the NP or adjective phrase functions as the predicate. In Urim a
    clause can minimally consist of only a single predicative noun phrase. Basic clauses consisting only
    of a verb are not allowed2, although this kind of text clause is very common as the result of ellipsis
    and clause chaining. All clauses can also have various types of optional adjuncts: accompaniment,
    instrument, time, location, reason, etc. In Urim the number of optional elements in a clause is usually
    restricted to at most two. The occurrence of these is semantically determined, and does not affect the
    description of the basic clause types.

    Many grammars talk about predication types instead of clause types, but we have chosen this traditional way of
    structuralist grammars to describe these basic syntactic structures of Urim. Also the ideas of dependence grammar have
    been used when describing Urim clause types.
    2 Some languages allow basic clause types without any ‘proper’ semantic or grammatical subject. For example, in
    Finnish the clause Sataa ‘It rains’ consists only of a verb without any semantic subject or subject NP on the surface,
    although the verb has third person singular Subject indexing inflection.. The corresponding clause in English has a
    semantically ‘empty’ subject it. In Urim these kinds of structures are not possible, unless the structure called here the
    time clause is interpreted as having a verb instead of a noun as the only constituent (see section 4.7).

    The following criteria have been used here to determine the basic clause types in Urim:
    -     1) How many obligatory arguments does the verb have? This is the main criterion. The
          presence or absence of a verb is often also used as the main criterion for dividing clauses
          into types. While Urim has both verbal and nonverbal clause types, there are also some
          minor types where the verb is optional or is deleted when negated. Therefore the presence
          of the verb is only used as a secondary criterion in determining Urim basic clause types.
    -     2) What are the syntactic functions (subject, object etc) and the semantic roles (agent,
          patient etc) of the arguments of the verb?
    -      3) Clause types may also have special syntactic features such as word order, negative
          form, case morphology etc. These, along with the meaning of the clause, have been used
          here only as secondary criteria in separating clause types.","[151, 152, 153]"
"    Certain types of embedded clauses have also other formal features that separate them from normal
clauses:a) reversed word order
Nominalized clauses can exhibit a reversed word order OV (instead of VO) when an object is present
but there is no surface subject in the embedded clause. Reversed word order also occurs in many
idioms and lexicalized expressions (e.f. won-huwen ‘inside-bury = forget’). It is especially non-
referential, generic objects, both nominal and clausal, that tend to occur before predicates in
embedded clauses. In following example an embedded clause functions both as the Subject and the
Object.",[179]
"                  Nep        mangkon al        ak     arkol       hu wak
                  coconut    green      drink use.R quench.R water desire
                  ‘Drinking green coconut helps to quench thirst’                  (comp. kupm hu wak-opm ‘I am thirsty’)                  Kupm       ake      ariwe      waprekg              antokg
                  1sg        NEG      know.R     smoke                do
                  ‘I do not smoke’
                                                                                                           180                     kil      ariwe hapm         angkut
                     3sg      know.R cloth       sew
                     ‘She knows how to sew clothes’                     compare to:                     Kil       ariwe angkut          hapm ak-angklei           wang
                     3sg       know      sew         cloth use-swallow         time
                     ’She uses to sew all the time.’  The parts of this construction are never pronounced or written as one word. Another feature is that
  the verb in this construction never gets irrealis mode. When the clause functions as object of a
  ‘normal’ verb (that is, not one of those verbs taking clausal objects, that are described later in 7.2.2.) it
  always ha reversed word order OV. Reason to this might be pragamtical; reversed word order
  disambiquates embedded clauses from serials (see the last example above). When the clause
  functions as subject, reversed word order is optional. Consider the following example:                     Antokg waprekg al yampis wekg ata, pa                   ti          angklon.
                     make smoke        eat bean       two     only that      this        forbidden
                     ’Smoking and eating beans, so these two only are forbidden.’  b) habitual-continuative marker -e
      In Urim the habitual-continuative marker -e often occurs in nominalized clauses, although this is
  not the primary function of this device. Primarily it serves to mark continuity and habituality. This
  device is more commonly used in relative clauses and sometimes also in adverbial clauses (see the
  sections 3.1.3.2 and 5.2). It seems to be used in all types of embedded clauses that are of locative
  type:                     kar         arpm -e       ari     paipm
                     car         sit.R-CNT see.R bad
                     ‘It feels bad to travel in a car’      These two devices, word order OV and suffix -e, may occur in any kind of embedded clauses, but
  are not obligatory.
5.2.2.   Clausal objects
      The number of verbs taking clausal objects is restricted in Urim. Most of the verbs co-occurring
  with clausal objects fall into the following semantic groups: causative, emotional verbs, verbs of
  sensation, cognitive, and quotative verbs. Some verbs may take either a noun phrase object or a
  clausal object, but not both together. Others (especially quotative verbs) can take both a noun phrase
  object and a clausal object at the same time. In such cases, the clausal object is usually the second
  object. The object NP has the role of Benefactive or Dative. A few verbs take only clausal objects..
                                                                                                       181
Clausal objects are usually unmarked morphologically and in speech no pause separates the main
clause from the complement.
    Clausal objects are sometimes governed by the conjunctions la ‘speak/that’ or eng ‘OBL’. With
some verbs, the use of a conjunction is obligatory (and these complement clauses are not considered
real clause objects)
    With other verbs, semantically obligatory clausal objects are sometimes marked by conjunctions,
and sometimes not. Typically the nominal objects of these verbs are likewise sometimes marked, and
sometimes not. The presence of a governing conjunction in the complement clause seems sometimes
to depend on transitivity, in that a conjunction is used when the action is considered weakly transitive.
For example the action of ‘liking’ / ‘wanting’ in the following examples does not much affect its
object:                  Kupm           wakrongen-teitn /      man -yan
                  1sg            like - 2sg /           mother-father
                  ‘I like you / my parents’
                  Kupm       wakrongen la        irmpen          namung
                  1sg        like        say     buy.IR          banana
                  ‘I want to buy bananas’                  Tu      la wasrongen        eng irmpen
                  3pl     say like            C     buy.IR
                  ‘They say they want to buy’ (double embedding).","[179, 180, 181]"
"      The overall order of constituents in the Urim verb is:
  verb root (Habitual-Continuative -e) (Transitive -en) (IO-marker -n) (Object Pronominal Clitic)
      In Urim a verb stem can be simple, reduplicated, compound, or consist of a root morpheme plus a
  derivational affix (sometimes more than one) (see the section 2.12.3).
2.2.1.       Realis-Irrealis Mode
  Ablaut involving the modal morphemes i ‘irrealis’ 3 and a ‘realis’ is exhibited by approximately
  two thirds of the verb stems. These vowels usually occur on the first syllable of the verb. In many
  Urim verbs the first syllable consists of this vowel only. Consider the following forms:          Realis Form           Irrealis Form         Meaning                          Canonical Form Of Root

  2 Although there is no Subject-indexing person-number inflection on the verbs, Urim does have a set of Object pronominal
  enclitics, which are phonologically bound to the verb stem when they occur. These are analysed here as separate words on
  the grammatical level, which fill the Object NP slot.",[22]
"        The semantic role of the transitive subject is almost exclusively that of agent. This means that
    usually only animate referents occur as subjects of transitive clauses. Agents are prototypically
    animate, volitional and active causes of an action. In Urim forces of nature and moving machines can
    also frequently occur as transitive subjects. When other, less prototypical kinds of inanimate entities
    occur as transitive subjects there are usually some morphological changes in the clause: the ultimate
    agent occurs as clause topic at the beginning (16b), or an instrumental serialization with the verb ak
    ’do’ is used(16a).8
            (16a)    Hu       kop       ak         almpen              yo.

                     Mowal        axe       cut.R -2sg.O
                     ‘Mowal (accidentally) cut himself with an axe.’        In example (16b) the actor hurts himself accidentally. In this case the instrument usually appears
    as the subject and the actor as the object of the clause
        A number of examples are now given of normal transitive clauses with clause initial subjects
    bearing the semantic role of agent. Transitive clauses can also have an optional indirect object, which
    is usually marked by the preposition eng or the affix -n on the verb (underlined).

                 ‘I am going to buy myself some clothes.’
4.4.2.   Ditransitive Clauses
      Transitive clauses can be divided into two subgroups in Urim: monotransitive and ditransitive
  clauses. There are relatively few verbs that require three obligatory arguments. The semantic role of
  the third argument can be benefactive or recipient and sometimes also locative or instrumental. The
  ditransitive subtype is here defined purely on a structural basis. Optional benefactives etc. are almost
  always marked by the preposition eng, which is reduced into a suffix -n occurring between the verb
  and direct object, if the direct object is a personal pronoun (17d), (17e). Obligatory benefactives etc.
  are morphologically unmarked.
      In some cases the border between obligatory and optional third argument is not clear
  morphologically. If the verb already has a suffix -en, there will be no other suffix -n as the result of
  dative shift (17 f). Certain verbs behave sometimes like ditransitive verbs, sometimes like mono-
  transitives; compare examples (18c) and (18d). The example (18d) is monotransitive since the
  locative phrase kai ampei cannot occur without the preposition. This shows the same kind of
  phenomena of gradual transitivity that was discussed earlier in the section 2.         (18a) Kil        plan -to           wan.

           (18e)   Tu      ik    -en       hu          kuntuk.
                   3pl     do.IR-TR        water       pot
                   ‘They pour water into the pot.’4.5. Nominal Clauses
        The nominal clause consists of two nominal phrases or a nominal phrase and an adjective phrase.
    No overt copula occurs linking the subject/topic noun phrase and the nominal or adjectival predicate.
    There are two types of nominal clauses: equative and descriptive.
        A negative nominal clause is formed by the verbal negation word ake (22e) even if there is no
    verbal predicate. This distinguishes the nominal clause from the possessive clause, which sometimes
    looks similar (23d).
  4.5.1.   Equative Clause
        The equative clause has two noun phrases as obligatory constituents; both denote the same
    referent. If the order of these noun phrases is changed, the first NP automatically becomes the
    subject of the clause and the meaning of the clause often changes too - this means that the word order
    of this clause type is very rigid. Consider the following examples:
           (19a)   Wail     pa        kipman          a-kupm-en.
                   big      that      man             G-1sg-ATR
                   ‘That big one is my husband.’
           (19b)   Kipman          a-kupm-en          pa            wail.
                   man             G-1sg-ATR          D             big
                   ‘My husband is a big man.’
        The subject of an equative clause is nearly always given information and is therefore marked as
    definite by the demonstrative pa. Pa ‘that’ and ti ‘this’ also frequently function as demonstrative
    pronouns and encode the subjects of equative and descriptive clauses. In other clause types this
                                                                                                         165
  pronominal function is very rare - at least there are no examples of it in the text material used here as
  data. A possible reason for this might be the potential for confusion with the numerous instances of
  pa and ti functioning as conjunctions and discourse markers in more complex sentences. In the
  structural simple nominal clauses, there is less possibility of confusion between the various functions
  of these demonstrative forms. The equative clause can, contrary to the descriptive clause, also have
  proper noun phrases or pronouns as predicates (20a), (20b). Quite often equative clause consists of
  one nominal phrase only (20d). In this case the subject pronoun has been deleted.         (20a)   Waring ti,      yikal              pa.
                 betel  this/her bow                that/there
                 ‘The betel palm is this here, the black palm is that over there’.’
         (20b)   Nang          a -kupm-en Pol.
                 name          G-2sg -ATR Pol
                 ‘My name is Pol.’

                 this   woman        DIM        G-1sg            now-EMP

"3.1. Overall Structure of the Urim Noun Phrase
       Overall, the constituents in the noun phrase have the following linear order (from first to last):         1.   Inalienable Genitive
         2.   Head (This may be either a single noun or a sequence of nouns occurring as a noun
              complex. See below for further discussion.)
         3.   Attributive Modifiers (Multiple occurrences of these are possible. When this happens, they
              occur in the order: Colour > Size > Quality.)
         4.   Quantifiers (Multiple occurrences possible)
         5.   Alienable Genitives
         6.   Relative Clauses
         7.   Demonstratives
        Almost all modifiers can co-occur. Exceptions to this are: 1) alienable genitives do not co-occur
    with inalienable genitives, and 2) alienable or inalienable genitives do not co-occur with relative
    clauses. There are examples of two relative clauses modifying a Head noun.
        A number of examples of Urim noun phrases will now be given which illustrate the above
    ordering of noun phrase constituents.",[122]
"4.3. Semitransitive Clauses
        In many languages clauses having motion or locative verbs and locative adverbials are classified
    as intransitive. Here these clauses are called semitransitive since they are semantically and
    syntactically somewhere between transitive and intransitive clauses. The word order and functional
    structure of semitransitive clauses is very much like that of transitive clauses in Urim. Both have two
    obligatory nominal constituents situated before and after the verb.
        Dependency grammar classifies these verbs as two-place predicates since the location or goal can
    be considered semantically obligatory with verbs like ‘arrive’ or ‘be situated’. For this reason the
    goal or location in these clauses is often called locative object.(Givon 1984: 110, Lyons 1977:496) In
    Urim there are no morphological differences between direct objects of transitive clauses and locative
    objects; both are morphologically unmarked and always occur immediately following the verb.
    Optional locative arguments of the verb are marked by prepositions. The only syntactical difference
                                                                                                           159
  between direct objects and locative objects is that direct objects can be fronted while no fronting of
  locative objects has been found in our data.
      The ‘less transitive’ status of these clauses is reflected also in the use of transitive suffixes. The
  same suffix -en which can change intransitive verbs or clauses into transitive or semitransitive ones
  can also change semitransitive verbs into transitive ones. Actually deriving transitive verbs from
  semi-transitive ones is much more common in Urim than deriving transitive verbs from intransitive
  ones. Compare the following examples (10a,b) with examples (1a,b).         (10a)   Kil     rpma       kanokg.
                 he      sit.R      ground
                 ‘He sits on the ground.’
         (10b)   Kil     arpm -en kar.
                 he      sit.R - TR car
                 ‘He is waiting for the car.’
      Semitransitive clauses are here divided into three subtypes: locative clauses, directional clauses,
  and resultative clauses. The basic structure of these clause types is the same, but they differ in
  meaning, in respect to what semantic role the locative object has, and what verbs can function as
  predicates.
4.3.1.   Directioned Motion Clause
      The locative object usually encodes the goal of the motion but also sometimes encodes the source
  or starting point. Usually a motion verb (there are about 10 verbs in this special verb class) functions
  as predicate. These verbs do not exhibit a realis-irrealis mood distinction. In serial verb phrases
  some of them can function to encode locative arguments and as aspect markers (see section 3.3.6).
  Directed motion clauses are very common in Urim texts and often form clause-chains. Following are
  some examples of directional clauses.
         (11a)   Melnum pa kawor wan.
                 man      D     enter    house
                 ‘The man went into the house.’
         (11b)   Hu         angko-we        wan            kimpo.
                 water      fall.R-CNT house               roof
                 ‘Water comes in through the roof.’
         (11c)   Am      ok           kai        lukg      ise.
                 now     mouth        go         money     PERF
                 ‘Now they started to talk about money.’
                                                                                                         160         (11d)   Kil     angko kai-nar           hu
                 3sg     fall.R go-descend       water
                 ‘He fell into the water’4.3.2.   Locative Clause
      The locative clause is structurally similar to the directed motion clause but differs semantically
  and in respect to which verbs can function as predicates. This clause type can have as predicates one
  of only six posture verbs: rpma ‘sit’, rmpa ‘lie’, itna ‘stand’, rka ‘hang’, ela ‘be situated’, and
  ha ‘be around’. Any specific referent can occur as the subject, and the second argument denotes the
  location of the subject. A locative object is morphologically unmarked but sometimes a serial verb
  construction with one of the motion verbs is used to more precisely specify the location.
         (12a)   Hu       wail      paipm     ur         rmpa         ya.
                 water    big       bad       ID         lie.R        road
                 ‘There was an awfully big pool of water on the road.’
         (12b)   Yangul     rmpa        (kaino)       wrik.
                 pencil     lie.R       go.up         table
                 ‘The pencil is (up there) on the table.’
      The locative clause is often used to introduce new information. This does not have any effect on
  the word order, which seems to be very rigid just like in the directional clause. The subject always
  occurs before the verb and the locative object after it.
         (13a)   Panis      pukpuk      ur   pa      itna       kainar            pake.
                 farm       crocodile ID D           stand.R    go.down           EMP
                 ‘There is a crocodile-farm down there.’
         (13b)   Kolpa kai-kai, wapwar wekg ur                  ha -pa. Atom         ekg        la ...
                 thus     go-go       cousins    two    ID      be.R-there then      two        say
                 ‘This went on for a long time. There were two children, cousins. They said...’
      In both (13a) and (13b) the locative clause marks the beginning of a new paragraph or section in
  the text, because it introduces a new important participant or other topic to the text. If the new items
  are not topical, i.e. important in the text, they are often introduced by using an embedded locative
  clause, as in the following examples.
         (14a)   Men     kawor wan ur pa            ela    wureren        wrik    a       kirmpa
                 1pl.Exc enter house ID D           stay.R near           place   G       aeroplane
                 ‘We went into a house near the airport.’
                                                                                                              161         (14c)    Wa     bot       al-tu    ha-pa            am         wa                aye       kul ...
                  and    boat      G-3pl    be-there         now        HES               carry.R   come
                  ‘And their boat they had brought...’4.3.3.   Resultative Clause
      Resultative clauses differ from other semitransitive clauses in that they can have either nominal or
  adjectival phrases as their second obligatory argument. Otherwise they are structurally similar to the
  directional clauses. Usually they have one of the same motion verbs as the predicate. There are only
  one or two verbs that occur in resultative clauses (see example 15d). Semantically the resultative
  clause always denotes some kind of change in the subject referent. The second argument expresses
  the direction or result of the change. This can be considered an extension of the semantic role GOAL
  attached to the motion verbs in their basic use. Syntactically and semantically the resultative clause is
  closely related to certain nominal clause types; the only differences being: 1) the dynamic meaning,
  and 2) the occurrence or non-occurrence of a verb (see section 4.5)7
         (15a)    Tu kai         uror            perngten.
                  3pl go         old             quickly
                  ‘They grow old quickly.’
         (15b)    Warim angko wail.
                  child fall.R big
                  ‘The child grew big.’
         (15c)    Kupm     palng         wor         kai      wam        a-kil-en.
                  1sg      arrive        good        go       hand       G-3sg-ATR
                  ‘I became well in his care.’
         (15c)    Kil     pa     wake          kanil
                  3sg     D      change. into moon
                  ‘She changed into the moon.’
     7   Compare the following examples:                 (a)           Warim            pa                 wail
                               child            D                  big
                               ‘The child is big’                  (descriptive clause)                 (b)           Warim           angko               wail             ise
                               child           fall.R              big              CMP
                               ‘The child has grown big’           (resultative clause)                 (c)           Warim            pa                 wail             ise

                               ‘The child is already big’          (descriptive clause)
                                                                                                                162
4.4. Transitive Clauses
  4.4.1.    Monotransitive Clauses
        The characteristic of this clause type is that it has an obligatory direct object with the usual
    semantic role of affected patient or patient-of-result. Unlike locative objects, this object can be easily
    fronted for thematic purposes.. The verb in this clause can either be a non-derived transitive verb or a
    transitive verb derived by a transitivizer suffix.","[158, 159, 160, 161, 162]"

    Urim is a non-Austronesian language spoken in Papua New Guinea. Laycock (1973) classifies it as a
    stock-level isolate of the Torricelli Phylum. It is spoken by about 3400 people, who live in 16 villages
    in the southern foothills of the Torricelli Mountains. Twelve of the villages are located south of the
    Sepic Highway, and one is north of the highway, in the Maprik Sub-District of East Sepik Province. The
    remaining three of the villages are located west of the Bongos River in the Nuku Sub-District of the
    West Sepik Province. The villages west of the Bongos River speak the Kukwo dialect, and the villages
    east of the Bongos River speak the main Urim dialect (also called Yangkolen by the Kukwo people).
    The Urim language has also been called Kalp, which comes from the word kalpm ‘no’ in the Kukwo
    dialect.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"
"
    The important notion of transitivity distinguishes the two most common basic clause types in any
language: intransitive and transitive clauses. There are degrees of transitivity in clauses, since the
notion of transitivity is a graded continuum (Givon 1984: 98, 152-157). In the prototypical, highly
transitive clause the subject referent is a volitional, controlling agent or a non-volitional cause/effector
                                                                                                                          154and the object is a concrete, result-registering effect or patient. Many objects are less than
prototypical
    In Urim certain clause types have an intermediate degree of transitivity, and are therefore called
here semitransitive. Clearly transitive verb stems are not as common in Urim as in many other
languages. Many verbs can have both transitive (or semitransitive) and intransitive (or reflexive) uses
( 1a), (1b), with no morphologically marking to indicate a change in transitivity. In Urim transitive
verbs are often derived from intransitive ones via addition of the transitive suffixes -en or -e.3. These
suffixes can increase the transitivity of an intransitive verb or clause, making it transitive or
semitransitive (1a), (1c). They can also change semitransitive verbs into fully transitive verbs.
Consider the following examples:
        (1a)     Kil       hokg rmpa             nung.
                 3sg       sleep lie.R           log

3 The suffix -en is much more common and occurs with all kinds of intransitive verbs, while the suffix -e increases the
transitivity of motion verbs only and occurs more frequently as a continuative aspect marker.

                  ‘Child cries after father.’                     (transitive - inflectional)4.2. Intransitive Clauses
        The basic difference between transitive and intransitive clauses is that an intransitive verb has
    only one obligatory argument, whereas a transitive verb has two or more obligatory arguments. In
    Urim the difference between obligatory and optional nominal constituents of the clause is quite
    consistently reflected in the surface structure. The obligatory constituents are almost always
    morphologically unmarked noun phases (no prepositions, no markings on the verb), whereas optional
    constituents are usually expressed as prepositional phrases. There are only a few exceptions to this
    rule. With certain verbs the second obligatory NP in the clause ( the second argument of the verb) is
    morphologically unmarked when it is a pronoun, but requires a preposition when it is a full noun
    phrase. These verbs are probably on the borderline between transitive and intransitive verbs Thus
    far only a few verbs of this type have been found.           (4a)   Tu           wakrongen-tetn.
                  3pl          like  - 2sg.O
                  ‘They like you.’           (4b)   Tu      wakrongen        eng          mansan
                  3pl     like             PUR          parents
                  ‘They love their parents’
       The subject of an intransitive clause always occurs before the verb and can exhibit almost any
    semantic role. In this respect intransitive clauses differ from all other clause types in Urim.           (5a)   Hu             awe             wail             paipm.
                  water          rain.R          big              bad
                  ‘It’s raining hard.’           (5b)   Nampa           haru.
                  dog             bark
                  ‘The dog barks.’
           (5c)   Hapm       plalng.
                  cloth      finished
                  ‘There are no more clothes left.’           (5d)   Tu           warim          akatnong.
                  3pl          child          play.R
                  ‘The children are playing.’
                                                                                                                         156
      In Urim the subject noun phrase is obligatory in all basic clause types. Even expressions
  describing natural phenomena which in many languages have no semantic or surface subjects, or have
  a ‘dummy’ subject (like the it in English it rains) require overt subjects in Urim (5a). In text clauses,
  however, subjects are often absent as the result of ellipsis, when the identity of the subject referent is
  clear from the previous context.
4.2.1.     Time Clauses
      There are two structurally peculiar types of clause that could be described as subtypes of the
  intransitive clause. One of them, which is here called the time clause, consists of one element only;
  a noun phrase denoting time of day. The reasons why these words are not considered lexical verbs
  are: 1) these time words do not have any case frame with arguments, in other words, the time clause
  never has any other obligatory elements except the time word itself, which functions both as the
  subject and the predicate of the clause. 2) In Urim nouns and verbs do not usually have the same
  morphological form in the lexicon (like English ‘love’ or ‘fish’ for example), although verbs and verb
  phrases can easily be nominalized without any formal marking. 3) Another reason fro classifying time
  words as nouns is that adjectives can be formed from them by the suffix –et. This is rare with verbs.
  4) Aspectual, temporal, and modal particles can occur in this time clause the same way as in verbal
  clauses. This is possible, because they do not belong to the verbal morphology but are clausal
  particles.
      Time words also resemble verbs semantically more closely than most other nouns, since the
  points of time are not actually fixed units but processes. Normally nouns represent the most
  permanent states, verbs the most rapidly changing states, and adjectives are somewhere in between
  (Givon 1979a: 265-266).4
      The time clause is fairly common in texts but is sometimes difficult to differentiate from
  dislocations.
          (6a)      Kong,      atom          men                   kai.
                    morning    then          1pl.Exc               go
                    ‘When the morning came, we left’           (6b)     Mining       ise.
                    dark/night PERF
                    ‘The night has fallen/ It has become dark.’
  4 In Urim time is not associated with location like in many other languages (Lyons 1977:669). No locative prepositions
  appear in time adverbials; instead the verb ak ‘do’ is used. This word is used also as the instrumental and manner phrase
  marker.
                                                                                                            157
4.2.2.   Clauses Predicating Existence
      Another subtype of intransitive clause, the existence clause, is also common in the texts. It
  usually takes the same sort of posture verbs as the locative clause as predicates, but does not have any
  locative object. Another difference from locative clauses (described in the section 6.4.2) is that the
  negative form of existence clause is always verbless, and it is possible to omit the verb in some
  positive existence clauses as well. Verbal clauses are negated using the verbal negative particle ake
  (see example 7d), but in a negated existence clause the nominal negative word kalpis is used instead,
  and the verb is missing.
         (7a)    Men     kai-nar      ari      nangnang pa kalpis.
                 1pl.Exc go-descend but        singsing    D not
                 ‘We went down but there was no singsing-feast’     (7b)        Kitn        yul                rmpa?           Yul            rmpa          pa!

                 ‘Do you have any fish?                          ‘Yes, I do have some fish.’         (7c)    Kitn        yul                rmpa?           Yul             kalpis!
                 2sg         fish               lie.R           fish            not
                 ‘Do you have any fish?                          ‘There is no fish!’     (7d)        Kupm      ake            yul           rmpa!
                 1sg       NEG            fish          lie.R
                 ‘I do not have fish!’
      Another special feature of this clause type is that the subject can easily occur after the verb. In
  other intransitive clauses this is very rare and probably impossible in other clause types.","[153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"

in Subject position (Givon 1979a :72-74). In Urim, however, it is possible to have Subjects introdu-
cing new information, but often left-dislocations, existence clauses or topic structures are used to
avoid this. Only topical, important items are introduced to the text in subject position. Less important
items are usually introduced in the typical position of new information after the verb. In Urim this NP
introducing new information quite often has an embedded locative clause as a constituent. Some of
these are lexicalized into deictic adverbials, like the expression ha-pa in the examples above.

6.2.2.   Tracking participants and maintaining topics; anaphora
  Urim speakers can refer back to known referents by using pronouns, zero-anaphora, or full noun
  phrases. With noun phrases, the demonstrative pronoun pa usually occurs as a modifier in order to
  mark of givenness of the referent:                    Kil kai     ari     wan,    kukwa       wanyun           pa

      If the referent is not particularly important and there can be only one such item at the certain point
  of the story, no marker of definiteness or indefiniteness is necessarily used. Consider the following
  examples:                    Kil     no             minip,       kaino       karpo              kwokg

     In the first example it is assumed that the river is the nearest one, and it is not really important
  which creek he followed. In the second example the referent is known from the situation.","[249, 250, 251]"
"      In speech pa has certain phonetic features that help distinguish its various functions. As a
  conjunction, pa is either preceded or followed by a pause. Native speakers are often unsure about
  where to write the comma in written language. But in spoken language the differences of function
  associated with pre- or post-pausal occurrence of pa are clearer. It is generally the case in the
  language that whenever a conjunction occurs before a pause, it is pronounced with a distinctive rising
  intonation and often its final vowel is also lengthened. This is true for pa as well.
                                                                                                      223
    -     When pa occurs after a pause, it usually functions as a coordinating conjunction linking
          clauses encoding two successive event. Sometimes pa is also used when there is some sort
          of weak causation involved; for example the previous event must occur before the following
          one can happen (time sequence, local connection etc.). The conjunction pa that occurs after
          a pause is usually unstressed, but can be stressed in order to emphasize the temporal or
          causal relationship between the conjoined clauses. When pa is unstressed, it is difficult to
          distinguish it from the coordinative conjunction a, since both can be pronounced and written
          as wa. Still, the fact that these both can occur next to each other in the same clause shows
          that they are separate words (as in the following example).","[222, 223]"

                    ‘They have given them away (the piglets), there is two left.’ (existential clause)      The thematic motivation of moving the subject after the verb seems to be strong emphasis or
  focusing of new information. In spoken utterances the subject NP is usually phonologically
  emphasized, being pronounced with high pitch and stress on the last word.
6.1.2.   Object fronting
      The Object can occur in front of the subject, or sometimes between the subject and verb, without
  any danger of misinterpretation, since in Urim transitive clauses the subject referent is usually more
  animate and than the object referent. If both subject and object are animate, a fronted subject is
  usually overtly marked as topic via use of the demonstrative pa or a pronoun:                    Nol             tu     ak     eng     manto

                                                                                                         244
   Most frequently object fronting occurs in texts, where the topic is an inanimate entity, which
cannot freely occur as subject. In following examples the fronted object represents new information:                  Nokg      tiur      mpa         la    kunukg pa.

natural texts, and some speakers do not consider it to be very good language:                  Kupm         wan        okipma       rmpa
                  1sg          house      food         lie.R

                  ‘I have food, in the house’    In certain cases object may occur before verb also in subordinated clauses. This seems to be
possible only when the object is generic. The construction does not seem to have any thematic
function.","[243, 244]"

      Many rules, especially the schwa-rule (rule 10) but also most consonant insertion rules (rules 1, 2)
  and the palatalization rule (rule 7) are conditioned by stress so that they either occur only in
  unstressed syllables (schwa-rule) or in or after stressed syllables (consonant insertions).
      Assimilation rules 7 and 8 and dissimilation rules 9 and 10 apply only inside a phonological word
  (except rule 7 b: t --> ts change after palatalization, which can occur over word boundaries). These
  rules serve to help in recognizing the phonological word.
      Insertion and deletion rules 1-6 apply frequently over word boundaries in phrases and also
  elsewhere in rapid speech. The closer knit the structure is, the more regularly most of these rules
  apply.","[18, 19]"

6.1.3.      Left Dislocation
      Left dislocations and topic constructions are common thematical devices in Urim. Their main
  function is to mark topics, especially when new topics are introduced or when a topic changes. When
  a constituent occurs at the beginning of a sentence, outside the clause proper and there is also some
  kind of co-referring constituent within the remainder of the sentence, this is termed here “left-
  dislocation”. Those constructions where no such coreferring element exists are termed “topic
  constructions”. In Urim this formal distinction is not very important pragmatically, since both types
  of construction have the same discourse functions.
      In a typical left dislocation construction, the dislocated NP occurs separated from the sentence
  proper, while a co-referring pronoun within the following sentence indicates its syntactic role. In
  Urim the dislocated NP can also be represented in the sentence by other means, depending on the
  syntactic role of the dislocated constituent. Almost any argument of a clause can be left-dislocated,
  while usually only Objects are fronted. Sometimes only a pause separates the dislocated NP from the
  sentence, but often the dislocated NP is marked by a following demonstrative or personal pronoun.
  Left dislocated Subjects
      Subjects are commonly dislocated in Urim and are usually represented by a coreferring pronoun
  within the sentence. Subject dislocations are a common way of introducing new topics. If the topic
  is new information, the left dislocated Subject is often marked by a combination of the indefinite
  quantifier ur and the demonstrative pa:                       Melnum ur       pa,   kil     kai     ari       wuring    al-kil     pa

  Left-dislocation of syntactically ‘heavy’ constituents
         Syntactically ‘heavy’ (i.e. complex) constitutents are often left dislocated.","[244, 245]"
"      Tallying then proceeds to the toes so that 11 is wampwam yikak wris, literally ‘ hand-hand leg
  one’. Preceding from the big toe to the little toe of the left foot in order, 15 is reached, ‘hand-hand
  leg-other-whole’. One holds the left fingers on those toes tallied. Tallying continues by holding the
  right fingers on the toes tallied on the right foot beginning on the big toe and preceding in order until
  the little toe is reached, thus giving a total of 20, (kamel wris, literally ‘person one’).

         The most important non-numeric quantifiers are listed below: Some of them are bi-categorical.",[84]
"      The Urim counting system has a modified (1, 2, 5, 20) cyclic structure, each cycle representing
  the tallying of the fingers of a hand or the toes of a foot, and there is and explicit 20- or ‘person’ cycle
  on the completion of tallying all the fingers and toes of a person (see Lean 1986).
  Tallying with fingers and toes
      All numbers can be tallied with fingers and toes and persons. Tallying begins on the little finger
  on the left hand which is bent down (often with help of the right hand) and proceeds in order until the
  thumb is bent down, the corresponding tally-direction is wampomis, literally ‘hand-other-whole’.
  Tallying then continues by bending down the little finger of the right hand continuing in order until
  the thumb is reached, thus giving the total of ten (wampwam, literally ‘hand-hand’). Sometimes upon
  reaching 10, the two fists are brought together.",[84]
"    In the following examples pa marks only time-sequence or possibly weak causation (for example,
one had to land to Madang first in order to sleep, but sleep does not necessarily follow). In the
following examples, commas are used to indicate where the pauses occur.",[224]
"      It is a very common phenomenon in languages that deictic pronouns or words derived from
  deictic pronouns also function as conjunctions. It is especially common to have causative
  conjunctions formed out of demonstratives, since they point to textual material as the explanation,
  reason, or basis for what is said.
  The conjunction pa
  The different functions of pa
      The word pa is the commonest word in Urim. In a corpus of 35 texts containing over 28,000
  words pa occurs about 355 times. This corpus contains mostly spoken texts but also some written
  ones. Pa is somewhat less common in written texts. In some clauses the word pa occurs 4 times.
  This is possible because of the many functions of this morpheme. The basic meaning of pa is far
  deictic—‘there’. When it functions as a modifier within a noun phrase, pa usually marks givenness /
  psychological accessibility of a referent to the hearer, but it can also function as a topic marker
  following various sorts of topicalized or left-dislocated constituents indicating a new temporal setting,
  a new or changed topic, or focus. As a phrasal head, pa can have following functions: deictic pronoun
  ‘that’, locative adverb ‘there’, emphatic particle, and conjunction.",[222]

                  ’Take a spoon and scrape with it’
Manner clauses marked by -en
     In Urim there is also a special type of adverbial manner clause, which always occurs in the middle
of the clause and has a verb morphologically marked by the suffix -en. This attributive suffix has
been described earlier in the section 2.6.2.2. Sometimes this embedded (or nominalized) manner
adverbial clause also has a reversed word order (O V). Curiously though, only a few verbs in Urim
seem to take this suffix in a manner clause, while simple manner adverbs can freely be formed from
all kinds of verbs by the same suffix. It seems that this embedded construction also has the additional
meaning of two actions having temporal overlap. This could explain why so few verbs can occur in
this construction; there are not so very many actions that one actor can perform two at the same time.
Often the manner suffix -en could be glossed ‘with’ in English. Consider the examples:                  Kupm       ngkat -en         monmon wuli
                  ‘1sg       carry.R-ATR baby         arrive

                   same way as above:                   Man     al-kil   pa nepm paipm-en              rpma      anong

5.3.3.   Locative adverbial clauses:
     Locative adverbial clauses in Urim are comaratively rare. Sometimes adverbial clauses
  expressing location are governed by prepositions, as in the following example.","[187, 188, 189]"
"                  Men      ampei wail wail, wanteng wor                  wor.

                  ‘the coffee branches that are very long so that one has to climb up in order to pick
                  [them].’    In the last example the word paipm ‘bad’ serves as intensifier of the adjective watinet ‘long’, and
the reduplication of paipm encodes the plurality of the whole NP.",[118]
"
           The following examples illustrate the use of pa as a demonstrative pronoun:                         Waring       ti,         yikal pa
                         betel nut    this        bow that
                         ‘The betel nut is here, the bow palm is there’                         Kupm wakrongen eng           la uwi         ok        manet-manet, pake

                         that    difficult       bad
                         ‘I would like to learn many kinds of languages, but it is very difficult.’
                                                                                                       91
    Because of its many functions at discourse level the purely demonstrative function of pa is
somewhat restricted in Urim. It can freely occur as independent demonstrative pronoun in most
positions, like the examples above show, but does not often occur as the subject of transitive or
intransitive clauses. The reason is probably that an independent word pa starting a clause could
easily be interpreted as a conjunction. Also it seems, that pa occurring as locative object would be
easily interpreted as emphatic particle. For this reason a deictic adverb is used instead. Compare the
following examples:                  Mentekg     rpma         ti!
                  1dual        sit.R       here

                  1sg           sit.R      EMP

                  C     go     stand.IR go          there

                  3pl     take.R      taro        be.R      there
                  ‘They took that taro’    This last example was elicited. The native speaker did not accept the expression wayu pa in this
clause, possibly because the clause was not part of any context or text. When pa is used with NP, it
almost always marks givenness (refers back to something mentioned in the text or known from the
context) and the demonstrative meaning is bleached. Therefore different combinations of verb + pa
are used instead to make it clear that the speaker refers to location, not to givenness.","[90, 91]"

Temporal Serialization
    Serializations consisting of the verb ak (IR ik) ‘use,do’ followed by a temporal noun plus the
predication are one means of expressing temporal arguments.",[52]

3.4.3.   Modal particles
    Imperatives and the clitic –o(m)
      Imperative modus is in Urim optionally expressed by using the clause-final imperative clitic –o.
  In imperative clause the verb or verbs are always in irrealis mode. Sometimes this clitic occurs in the
  form –om, which adds the meaning ‘now’ (possibly shortened from am ’now’). Imperative clitic is
  always attached to the last word of the clause or sentence:                    Wrekg          o!
                    rise           IMP
                    ’Get up!’                    Kitn    ti        wrekg        eng   ekg   kai       om!

                                                                                                    149                  Ikor        nung        o!
                  search.IR   wood        IMP
                  ‘Get firewood!’                  Mentepm       kaino     anong        o -m!

                  water         this      red     IMP
                  ’Let this water be red!’ (incantation)                  Mehen         o!
                  carefully     IMP
                  ’Be carefull!’ (notice that mehen is an adverb!)
    As the examples above show, in imperative clauses the subject may or may not appear on the
surface. Reason is pragmatical, since Urim verbs do not encode person or plurality.
    Following examples show that the clitic –o appears only once in the sentence:                  Kipmekg     pa        il     mpa kaino             o!
                  2dual       D         eat.IR FUT go                IMP
                  ’You two eat and go then!’                  Kirpo      pa        il         yangkipm           hute       elngen   o!
                  grab.IR    D         eat.IR     talk               straight   stop     IMP
                  ’Take heed of this straight talk and stop it!’                  Am kai uwi     nep       mangkon ur iye         kul     elk -opm il
                  now go get.IR coconut green        ID carry.IR come give-1sgO drink.IR
                  o!
                  IMP
                  ‘Now go get some green coconuts and bring me to drink!’
    Permissive imperative is encoded repeating the verb (possibly only the verb kai ‘go’, since no
other examples have been found this far) at the beginning of the clause. In this type of imperative the
personal pronoun is obligatory::                  Kai        kitn         kai       om
                  go         2sg          go        IMP.now
                  ’You may go now!’                  Kai     kitn iye              eng        al-kitn   o!
                  go      2sg    carry.IR       PBL        G-2sg     IMP
                  ’You can keep it!’    Imperatives can be expressed also without the particle –o. Possibly this is a weaker or ‘more
polite’ way to express orders and wishes.

      Other modal particles
      Urim also has two modal adverbs that are used to encode probability; pilpa ‘perhaps, must be’ and
  kol ‘possibly’. Both occur sentence initially, and hardly can be considered part of a verb phrase. The
  word kol also has several other usages; therefore it will be described in more detail in Section 5.6.
  Pilpa has been described earlier in Section 3.2.2.
3.4.4.   Serial structures
      Serial structures are formally of four types: coordinated, subordinated with main verb last,
  subordinated with main verb first, and preposition-like serials. The functions of serial structures are
  very various.","[148, 149, 150]"
"
         Dislocations and topic constructions instead are very common in Urim. In these constructions the
    topicalized or emphasized constituent occurs separately in front of the actual sentence, which relates
    to it in some way. In most cases the external topic corresponds to some NP constituent in the clause
    in which the external topic has some function. In left dislocation there is a grammatical element in the
                                                                                                           243
  clause (usually a pronoun), which refers to the same entity. In topic constructions this does not occur
  (Shopen p. 355).
6.1.1.   Moving of subject after verb
      Placing the subject after the verb is rather rare in Urim but can occur at least in certain clause
  types and when there is no danger of misinterpretation. No examples of this have been found in
  transitive clauses, but it seems to happen with subjects of transitive verbs in topic constructions
  (second example).","[242, 243]"

                                                                                                          33                  (Kupm)        ko       angket-opm
                  1sg           axe      cut.R -1sgO
                  ‘I accidentally cut myself with an axe’
    Another means to raise an inanimate entity to the subject position of a transitive clause is to add
the verb ak ‘(use something to) do’ to the predicate. Consider the following examples:
                  Nok     ak        karpon       tis
                  sago    use.R     stick.R      plate
                  ‘Sago sticks to the plate’                  Kuntuk wulmpa ak              aur         okipma
                  pot        eye        use.R cover         food
                  ‘The lid of pot covers the food’                  compare to:
                  Kil      aur       kuntuk     ak           hipm
                  3sg      cover     pot        use.R        leaf
                  ‘He covers the pot with leaves’                  Compare also following examples:                  Ki      ak        ar           wanyun
                  key     use.R     close.R      door
                  ‘The key closed the door’
                  Wripm      ar        wanyun
                  wind       open.R door
                  ‘Wind opened the door’ (potent noun as subject)     The semantic roles of the Subject in these transitive clauses are Cause or Instrument. The verb ak
in the second members of the example pairs could be interpreted as causative marker. On the other
hand, notice the use of ak as an Instrument marker in third and fourth example (see 2.5.1).
Temporal Nouns
   Temporal nouns like kong ‘morning’ are distinguished by their ability to function as temporal
adverbials and their potential use as predicates in temporal clauses like the following:                  Kong        ise
                  morning     PERF
                  ’The morning came.’                  Ran=o!
                  dawn=IMP
                  ‘Let there be light!’ (From Genesis 1:1)    The following examples show that these words really are nouns that can function as head of a NP.
                                                                                                        34                 ak      kong            ti
                 use.R morning           this
                 ‘this morning’                 ran         wris-wris
                 dawn        one-one
                 ‘every day’
Inherently Related Nouns (Inalienable Genitives)
    Urim has three types of inherently related nouns, 1) kinship terms, 2) body parts, 3) other part-
whole nouns. Kinship terms behave syntactically like other nouns, but have some structural
peculiarities. Many kinship terms are semantically plural. Some kinship terms seem to have some
kind of non-productive gender suffix: mamiin ‘grandfather’, mamikg ‘grandmother’, yalmpiin ‘son-
in-law, yalmpikg ‘daughter-in-law’.
    All part-whole nouns are distinguished by their ability to occur in genitive constructions
consisting of just two juxtaposed nouns (possessor-possessed ordering), without the presence of a
genitive pronoun or an intervening genitive preposition a. Consider the following examples:                 mirmping talpuk
                 tree sp.     branch
                 ‘branch of a mirmping tree’                 mayen       yilo
                 old.woman spine
                 ‘the old woman’s spine’                 rkim         walmpopm
                 python       blood
                 ‘the python’s blood’                 wan           kimpo
                 house         top
                 ‘top of the house’   Compare these five examples with the following alienable genitive examples (which have
possessed-possessor ordering):                 por             ketn      a       wampung
                 story           little    G       tree.kangaroo
                 ‘a little story of/about a tree kangaroo’                 yangkipm      a-kupm
                 talk          G-1sg
                 ‘my talk’    Part-whole relationships of inanimate entities are always expressed without a genitive marker, but
with body parts of animate entities, the genitive construction with a is quite common. It seems that
the genitive construction of juxtaposed nouns is used mainly when the possessor is referentially
generic:
                                                                                                                      35                     Kil     awi       manto          tukgunakg ur            pa

                     ‘He took a pig’s head’                     Tukgunakg      a      manto        ti
                     head           G     pig           this
                     ‘The head of this pig’                     Kil      ak        nalulng       wulmpa a         wusok      am        al.

                     ‘It dug out the little brother’s eye and ate it.’ (the expression *wusok wulmpa never
                     occurs)    When a genitive construction containing a body part occurs as the Object of a transitive clause the
possessor argument can be raised to object position before the noun. This happens only when the
possessor is topic, which is usually the case (same way as with bound pronouns; see the section 2. 4.
1. 2). The raising seems to happen only when the possessed noun is a body part:                     Trapuk      al    -opm         hi
                     fly         eat.R-1sgO         sore

                     you are teaching me the Urim language    When the possessor of a body part is expressed by a noun phrase (instead of pronoun), a third
person pronominal clitic -el is obligatorily attached to the noun phrase referring to the body part.7                     Kipman aro         won -el        warim              kipman         al-kil

                     ‘Fathers are teaching their sons’    Genitive noun phrases containing a body part do not easily occur in subject position. Instead
topicalized experiencer constructions are used. Compare the following examples:
7 Possibly this happens only with those predicates that obligatorily require the use of a bound pronoun, for example: ak
akor (el) ‘quarrel with somebody’, alk(el) ‘give to somebody’, num wakget (el) ‘have a fever’, etc.

  Locative nouns
      Locative nouns can be considered a special type of inherently related nouns since they can occur
  in same kind of genitive constructions. In Austronesian languages, such locative nouns are the
  primary means for encoding more specific locations. This seems to be the function of locative nouns
  in Urim also. Locative nouns usually occur in genitive constructions, but can also occur in isolation.
  In these cases the genitive is contextually given (see also locative adverbs 2.7.3).","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

  3.2.1.      Adjectival and Adverbial Phrases
        Comparison and degree with adjectives and degree with some adverbs is usually expressed

3.2.2.      Numeral Phrases
         Most numerals in Urim are formally coordinate phrases, which have the structure:
                  (Quantity Classifier (numeral))n (numeral)
      with the quantity classifiers—e.g. wampomis ’hand-other-whole’/’5’, wamwam ’hand-hand’/’10’,
  yikakwom ’leg-other’ / ’numeral beyond 10’, yikakwomis ’leg-other-whole’ / ’five beyond 10’, and
  kamel ’person’ / ’20’—being ordered from larger to smaller
                      wam-pomis wam-pom          wekg
                      hand-other hand-other      two

                      ‘twenty-one’
       Other kinds of numeral phrases are rare. Demonstratives and a few adverbials occur as modifiers
  in these phrases:
                                                                                                      140                   wris          yat

                   ‘One arrived’
3.2.3.   Pronoun Phrases
      In Urim texts, personal pronouns often co-occur with demonstratives and quantifiers. When
  demonstratives co-occur with pronouns, they typically indicate that a change in topic (often speaker)
  has occurred or emphasis.","[138, 139, 140]"

                  woman) modifying the head noun por ‘story’    When some essentially extraneous information is added about the Head Noun (information that
does not specify its referent) an independent clause or an apposition is often used instead of RC. In
the following example, the new person is introduced using both a relative clause and a ‘normal’

     genitive phrase or coordinated as modifiers of the same NP. Relative clauses provide a way to
     background less-important information so that the main story line remains in focus:                      Kol atopen       tiur    a mentepm a          itna        kanokg        ti..

         Complement clauses are embedded subordinate clauses, which function as core arguments of
     certain verbs.
         Clauses functioning as subjects or objects are quite common in Urim with all verbs. Most verbs
     of communication take clausal objects.
  5.2.1.    About lexical and clausal nominalization in Urim
        The term ‘nominalization’ means in essence ‘turning something into a noun’. It can mean one of
     two things, either “the process of forming a noun from some other word class or the derivation of a
     NP from an underlying clause” (Crystal 1985). Here we will focus on the second sense of
     nominalization, as the formal process by which clauses are changed so that they can also function as
     Heads of a noun phrase.
                                                                                                    178
     Urim seems to have no formal morphological devices to form lexical nouns from verbs or
adjectives. Both simple verbs and whole clauses can function as NPs without any overt change in their
morphological structure. Many lexemes freely function as both nouns and verbs, so that it is difficult
to tell which category is more basic. Others seem to be basically verbs but can function also as heads
of NPs.","[176, 177, 178]"

                      ‘At the time she slept in the menstruation hut (it was) now like that’
5.3.2.      Manner adverbial clauses
         In Urim manner is usually expressed by serial constructions, which almost always occur before  the main verb (like manner adverbs usually do) and can therefore possibly be considered  subordinated:                      Kil      pa tuwal      mlak              ela
                      3sg      D beak        hanging           be
                      ‘It was lying beak hanging down’
  Manner serials marked by ak:
      Manner serials can be marked by the Instrumental marker ak (originally verb ak ‘do’) same way
  as manner adverbs.
                      Tu    anel     ak    atatu         wuli
                      3pl pick.R do.R hurry.R            arrive
                      ‘They got up and came quickly’                      Ak       nimong apaharng rpma, rpma                 wan.
                      Use.R basket       cover.R       sit.R    sit.R     house
                      ‘It was hidden under the basket in the house’ (notice the reversed word order!)
         Compare to the following use of ak to mark manner phrase:                      tu      ak       wail wuli
                      3pl     use.R big     arrive
                      ‘They came in crowds’
     Often ak functions almost like the purpose marker eng and can be translated in English the same
  way ‘for’. The difference is that ak can also indicate the role of instrument, while eng never does.","[186, 187]"

  and /o/ do not change except sometimes when there is a phonemically identical vowel in the other
  syllable. Stress is never on the syllable with a reduced vowel. This ‘vowel disharmony’ rule always
  applies inside the morpheme. Sometimes it also applies over morpheme boundaries in compounds
  and in those reduplications that are clearly phonological words.","[16, 17]"

5.3.4.   Purpose-reason clauses marked by eng
      The basic function of the word eng is to mark oblique arguments. As a preposition, it governs
  especially indirect objects (mostly Benefactive and Recipient roles) and also some direct objects of
  less transitive verbs. To show the range of eng, I will first present here some examples of its use
  governing noun phrases and then examples of its use as a complementizer within subordinate clauses.
  Eng with noun phrases and clauses
     Prepositional phrases with eng are used to encode various types of Oblique arguments. It is
  commonly used to encode Benefactive-Recipient and Subject Matter ‘about/concerning’:                   Uwi        pa iye           kul      eng      kupm!

                   3sg      lie.R-1sgO OBL food
                   ‘He lied to me about the food’      Eng is also used to mark some optional non-Subject arguments of some verbs. The semantic role
  is usually Associative ‘concerning, with respect to’, Goal or Reason/Cause:

                  ‘He is afraid of the dog’    Subordinate clauses headed by eng express purpose, reason, or explanation. There is no
difference whether the purpose is expressed by using a full clause or just a noun phrase - eng is used
in both cases to mark it.","[189, 190]"

3.1.4.      Relative Clause
  Structure of Relative Clause
       Relative clauses occur following the head noun they modify and have the structure [a [S] ], with
  a functioning as a complementizer. The argument within the relative clause that is co-referential with
  the head noun that the relative clause modifies is omitted unless it functions as a genitive. In Urim the
  same noun can be modified by more than one relative clause:
                                                                                                          131                 Marpm wurkapm wekg a            pikekg kupm alk -etn   Ø                    pa.

    Instrumental relative clauses have the form [a [ak [Ø Verb…]]], where the instrument functions as
the Subject of a clause embedded under the verb ak ‘do, cause’. Instrumental relative clauses are often
used when speaking about new things for which the language does not yet have a word.","[130, 131, 132]"

                      cooked in the house.’        It is common in Urim for words to exhibit more than one syntactic function without any change in
    form to mark the change in category, much like in English e.g. the word fish can function both as a
    noun and a verb. This is especially true with the words that can function as modifiers of noun phrases
    or as predicates. Very often the same word functions both as adjective and adverb in Urim without
    any morphological change, for example such common words as paipm ‘bad; badly’ or wor ‘good;
    well’.
  2.6.1.    Underived Adjectives
        The class of underived adjectives in Urim is comparatively small. As in many other languages,
    the basic, most common adjectives are usually morphologically simple. Semantically these basic
    adjectives encode permanent properties of the entities, such as size, shape, age, or colour. Some of
    the principal underived adjectives in Urim are listed below:           Form                                                           Meaning

being characterized is set off from the predicative adjective by a demonstrative (pa, ti, kil, ai).","[58, 59]"

Subject referent is very generic or indefinite. Indefinite reference is sometimes also expressed by zero
anaphora, if some other NP is in the topic position in the clause. Third person singular indefinite
referents are also often expressed by using the noun kamel ‘body’ (comp. old English!) at least in the
object position. The third person plural pronoun tu is also used within the noun phrase to encode
plurality of human (or at least animate) entities (see section 2. 3. 1. 1)                  Tu awi       nampro a          tu     ak     alm       melnum amo pa

                  ‘Mosquitoes bite men’ (generic reference)    The third person singular person pronoun kil sometimes functions as a demonstrative pronoun
instead of the near demonstrative ti, and may in this function be attached to other singular pronouns or
nouns (see also the first example above). In this function kil can refer both to animate and inanimate
entities:                  Kupm kil        anong           yiprokg

                  cloth        3sg/this tight
                  ‘This piece of clothing is tight!’    In Urim, personal pronouns may be modified by demonstratives and quantifiers. When the far
demonstrative pa occurs modifying a personal pronoun, this construction has thematic function. The
demonstrative pa is used with personal pronouns to emphasize, express contrast, and mark something
as topical. This last function of pa makes it possible that in Urim texts two persons can be referred by
personal pronouns all the way through after initial introduction, even when the actor or speaker
changes:                  Kupm asen kil pa om:.... Ari kil pa la-la:...

                  ‘Do you have a fire like we here?’ (contrast, emphasis)Personal pronouns may also occur as part of coordinated and complex noun phrases:                  Wang     ur pa         mentekg Karis         hel    kainil
                  time     ID D          1du      Karis        roam moon

Object Pronominal Clitics
    The Object pronominal clitics are phonologically adjoined to the verb. They conflate the non-
singular number categories of the free pronouns, distinguishing only: 1) first, second, and third
persons, and 2) singular versus non-singular numbers.","[40, 41, 42]"
"It is also possible for the free pronouns to occur in the Object slot. Compare the following examples:                  Tu           or-opm
                  3pl          hit-1sgO
                  ‘They hit me’                  Tu     or kupm ti-ke!
                  3sg hit 1sg         this/here-EMP
                  ‘It was me they hit!’                  Atom          kupm       la     nak -el: ...
                  then          1sg        say    tell.R-3sgO
                  ‘Then I told to him:...’                  Atom kupm la naki kil pa                  la-la: ....
                  then    1sg      say tell.R 3sg D         say-say
                  ‘Then I told told to him:...’ (changing topic)    A bound pronominal Object is used when there is no need to highlight the pronoun for purposes
of contrast, emphasis, etc. The free pronoun is always used if any modifier co-occurs with the Object
pronoun. In the example immediately above, the demonstrative pronoun pa is used either for
emphasis or because the actor changes after this clause.
    What is said here applies also when a personal pronoun is used to refer to a peripheral clausal
argument (its semantic role typically being Recipient-Benefactive or Locative-Goal) . It is promoted
to core argument in the form of bound pronoun when the referent is an already activated topic that is
simply being maintained. All uses of the bound Object pronouns are thematically unmarked ‘normal’
uses. The use of a free pronoun in this position indicates extra prominence or emphasis on the referent
(for more examples see Section 2.2.4).
    The object pronominal clitics also occur as the result of a syntactic process of possessor
ascension, which lifts the possessor of an inalienable noun (usually a body part) out of the noun
phrase to serve as the Object of the verb. It is possible to have both the Object clitic and a co-
referential genitive pronoun if the possessor referent is especially emphasized or in focus, as in the
second example below:
                                                                                                    44                 Drapuk      al    -opm           hi

                 3sg      hit    stand.R-1sgO            eye
                 ‘He hit me in the eye’    When the verb and body part form a lexical unit, the Object pronominal clitic is obligatory. This
might be the origin of the use of suffix -el in idioms and lexemes as adverbializer. Compare
especially the two first examples below:                 Kitn aro -wopm won ok                anong-en        Urim

Genitive Pronouns
    The genitive pronouns exhibit the same person, number, and exclusive-inclusive distinctions as
the independent pronouns, being formed by phonologically adjoining the relative clause
complementizer a to a following independent pronoun. In essence, then, genitives in Urim are
formally a kind of minimal relative clause: pig that (is) I/mine = my pig.
    In addition, one or both of the following two modifications to the pronominal forms are possible:
1) the attributive suffix -en may be added to them, and 2) an /l/ may be added between the relative
clause complementizer a and the independent pronominal form. Thus, there are four possible forms
for each genitive pronoun. 8Person      Singular                 Dual                      Paucal     Plural

    The genitive pronouns occur following the noun and indicate relationships like: 1) kinship, 2)
body parts, 3) ownership, 4) production, 5) belongingness, 6) Exclusion/Emphatis (only the forms
containing the consonant /l/ but lacking the suffix; alkupm etc.).","[43, 44, 45]"

    1) Sequences of pronoun + noun are usually plural. The sequence of third plural pronoun plus
following noun is a common means of overtly indicating plurality.                 men      melnum

                 ‘the people of Ayum’   Sequences of a singular pronoun + noun also occur. Appositions are normally separated from the
main clause by a pause. Only the last example below has a clear pause between the pronoun and
appositional NP:                 kupm        Melming la nak -etn              por              ti

                 ‘We two, men from Maprik received two (of them)’    Other means of expressing plurality are reduplication and the word kweikwei ‘things’. These
form structures that are formally noun complexes:                 namung      kweikwei       a -tu-wen

                  ‘later the children and grandchildren will hear’    2) Sequences of generic noun + specific noun are usually phonologically two words with two
separate main stress. The second noun functions as modifier, helping to further specify the identify
the referent:

                  tree     sp.

                  ‘cooking fire’   The specifying part of noun complex may be also a name, or a combination of two words:                  mayen        Warmpale     yek ti

                 ‘wood of kampong-tree’
Resemblance of some co-ordinated noun phrases to noun complexes
    Since sequences of co-ordinated nouns can occur both with and without a coordinating
conjunction, the coordinated sequences without a conjunction formally resemble a noun complex.
However in co-ordinate noun phrases, unlike noun phrases, no noun is semantically modifying
another noun; both nouns have equivalent syntactic status.
    There is a slight phonological difference between a coordinate sequence of nouns and a noun
complex. In the case of noun complex, main stress tends to fall on the second noun. Coordinated
nouns are stressed equally.                  kiyom       a         kimining umpu
                                                                                                  127                 kiyom       and    kimining piece

                                                       (an almost lexicalized noun phrase)   There are more examples of coordinated phrases below and in the section 3.5.
How Noun Complexes differ from Apposition, Coordinative Noun Phrases,
    Compound Nouns and Inalienable Genitive Constructions
    Phonologically, the sequences of nouns in noun complex usually are separate words but the
difference between these structures and compounds is not always clear. The noun complexes
consisting of pronoun and noun are clearly two phonological words as well as the animal and plant
names. Other specifying noun+noun combinations and kinship terms tend to be pronounced as one
phonological word with one main stress, and can be termed compounds. The borderline between
compounds and phrases is a continuum.
    Semantically, the noun complex is relatively transparent, with each of the subsequent nouns
functioning attributively to restrict the reference of the head noun. Here they differ clearly from
coordinated phrases where none of the parts functions as a modifier of another. Coordinated nouns
always exhibit separate intonational contours, while in noun complex one noun (almost always the
second one) usually has the main stress. Sequences of coordinated nouns can function as a complex
head of a noun phrase and as a unit be modified by other NP modifiers:                 nimpa    karek     wor      wekg          a-kitn-en
                 dog      chicken good       two           G-2sg-ATR

   Coordinated noun phrases tend to get lexicalized and be pronounced as one phonological word.
Compare the following examples:                  kiin         (a)        watnom
                  woman        (and)      children
                  ‘wife and children’                  tu     kiin          watnom      al-kil

                  3pl      crowd     woman       and      man

                  1pl.Exc take.R woman-man two            go.down          Punam    D
                  ‘We took a couple from Punam (into the plane)’                  man-san     (mother-father)    ‘parents’
     The most important difference between a noun complex and an appositional noun phrase is that
the parts of noun complexes are not interruptible by other noun phrase modifiers. This is in contrast
to true apposition, in which the appositional noun phrase occurs after the full noun phrase, and
therefore there can be multiple modifiers intervening between the head noun of the noun phrase and
the head noun of the appositional noun phrase. Consider the following examples:                  warim       a-kupm Karis
                  child       G-1sg     Karis
                  ‘My child, Karis’ (apposition)                  warim       Karis    a-kupm-en
                  child       Karis    G-1sg-ATR
                  ‘My Karis-boy’ (noun complex?)                  anong     Laningwap       wail          a-mentepm-en
                  village Laningwap         big           G-1pl.Inc -ATR
                  ‘Our big Laningwap village ’     Inalienable genitive constructions and noun complexes are similar formally and phonologically,
but differ in that the initial noun phrase functions as a genitive modifier of the following noun rather
than the following noun functioning as a modifier of the initial noun. Also, the genitive noun phrase
itself can contain modifiers, whereas the head noun in a noun complex would not have any modifiers:                  wan-yun       (house-door)     ‘door’
                                                                                                      129                    wan      wail       yun

                    ‘The door of a big house’ (inalienable genitive NP with a modifier)                    wam-wuhor (hand-nail)         ‘fingernail’                    wam    man            wuhor
                    hand   mother         nail
                    ‘thumbnail’
3.1.2.   Adjectives and Quantifiers in the Noun Phrase
      It is possible to have more than one adjective modifier in a noun phrase, although occurrences of
  more than two adjectives modifying one noun phrase are not common in texts (see section 5.1 for an
  example of three adjectives modifying a head.). The typical ordering of multiple adjectives is color >
  size > quality. The adjective paipm ‘bad’ tends to occur before other adjectives, because the same
  form is also used as degree adverb ‘very’ modifying adjectives (third example). The diminutive word
  yek ‘poor’ usually occurs after other adjectives.                    wan      wusok yek ur         pa
                    house small poor ID           D
                    ‘a poor small house’                    hu        paipm     wail      ur
                    water     bad       big       ID
                    ‘A big bad pond’                    compare to:
                    hu        wail      paipm     ur
                    water     big       bad       ID
                    ’a very big pond’                    nung         mis       wail paipm
                    firewood     heap      big  bad
                    ‘one big piece of firewood’     The exact order of quantifiers in the noun phrase has not been investigated enough yet. Usually
  numerals occur after non-numeric quantifiers. The indefinite ur ‘a, one’ can be classified either as
  quantifier or deictic; in the noun phrase it occurs between these two constituents.                    kil   awi      tikayo          watipmen      ur
                    3sg take:R basket              plenty        ID

                                                                                                        130
3.1.3.      Appositional Noun Phrases
      Appositional noun phrases are fairly common in Urim, although it is sometimes hard to tell
  whether a given structure should be called left dislocation or apposition. Appositional noun phrases
  differ from coordinated phrases in that both parts refer to the same entity. In Urim appositional noun
  phrases mostly occur when new referents are introduced into the text and their function is to add some
  more information about it. The only phonological feature is that there is usually a pause between
  apposition and the main NP.","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"
"    The border between verbs and adjectives in Urim is in many cases difficult to draw. Even such
basic adjectives that denote less permanent properties may occur as predicates not only in nominative
clauses (first example) but also in intransitive clauses with the imperative clitic -o. (possibly only in
special uses like incantations) and in experiential clauses that have both a topic and a Subject (last
example):                  Hu            ti        wakget ise
                  water         this      hot       PERF
                  ‘This water is already hot/has become hot.’                  Hu            ti       watet-o!
                  water         this     red -IMP
                  ‘Let this water become red!’ (incantation in a divination rite)                  Kupm          num       wakget-opm
                  1sg           skin      hot    -1sgO
                  ‘I have fever’    Those adjectives that can occur in an experiental construction with an accusative object could also
be analysed as verbs.",[59]
"   Examples of nouns formed by reduplication:

commonly used to intensify adjectives):

Reduplication and Repetition Encoding Intensity
   With adjectives and adverbs, reduplication is often used to express increased degree.
                 waseksek           ‘very small’            wasek         ‘small’
                 aripaipmpaipm      ‘very badly’            aripaipm      ‘badly’ (ari ‘see’ paipm ‘bad’)

                  ‘Walk very slowly lest you fall.’ (in quick speech men-men)                  Tu        wrong-wail-en        wrong-wail-en
                  3pl       crowd -big-ATR       crowd-big-ATR
                  ‘a lot of people, crowds of people’                  Kapm       am      pilpilet pilpilet    rka          ti.
                  pond       now     muddy muddy          hang.R       here
                  ‘But this pond is very muddy!’
    The suffix -en with adjectives lessens the property of the adjective the more it is repeated (see
section 4.5.3 ‘Comparison of Adjectives’):                  kongket-en -en -en             ‘just a little bit black’
                  black -ATR-ATR-ATR    In the same way, the partial repetition of a temporal adverb can be used to express increased
length of time:                  pikekg-tak-ai                  ‘long ago’
                  past - ? -remote                  pikekg-tak-tak-ai              ‘very long ago’
                  past -? -? -remote
    Also the words paipm and wor that are used as increased degree with adjectives, can be
reduplicated to strengthen the degree even more:                  watet    paipm-paipm
                  red      bad-bad
                  ‘very dark red’
Repetition Encoding Plurality
     One way of encoding plurality is to repeat the noun. This usually encodes indefinite amount of
referents. (see 3.3.2) Often the modifiers of NP—adjectives, adverbs, or numerals—can be repeated
instead of the Head noun. Sometimes even the verb can be repeated to encode the plurality of one of
its arguments (subject or object). In this case it usually encodes distributive aspect at the same time
(see also 2.13.2.4). Repetitions encoding plurality are only seldom written as one word.","[116, 117]"
"
        The demonstratives pa and ti have a wide range of discourse functions. These are discussed
    more thoroughly in the paper ‘Demonstrative Pronouns in Urim Discourse’ (LLM 1989). Here we
    will indicate those functions only briefly. Both pa and ti are also used as conjunctions. These
    functions are described later in section 5.5.6.
  2.9.1.      The far demonstrative pa
        The word pa is by far the commonest word in Urim. In a corpus of 28,000 words, pa occurs over
    3,500 times. About half of these are conjunctive uses of pa. In spoken Urim, intonation often helps
    to distinguish the different functions of pa. When pa is used as conjunction, it tends to be longer and
    more stressed than when it is a noun phrase constituent (see also section 5.5.6).",[90]

                    ‘The men who went to have bath are coming’ or
                    ‘The men just went to have a bath and are coming now’      It also seems that when one of the temporal adverbs like wet ‘recently, just before’, mpa ‘future’,
  ikga ‘later, far future’ etc. is used, the relative pronoun tends to be left out. This is possible because
  the time adverb already separates the relative clause from the present time of the story. Notice that the
  relative pronoun can sometimes occur after the time adverb, like in the two first examples:                    Tu    wrong kiinkipman wet (a)          kaing-kai wuring pa, wuli wuli pake

5.1.2.   Syntactic role of the relative noun within the relative clause
      In Urim relative clauses are very common in texts. The co-referring relative noun within the
  relative clause can exhibit almost any syntactic role. Thus far, relative nouns with the roles of Subject,
  Object, Indirect Object, Locative Object, Locative, Accompaniment, Time, and Instrument have been
  observed.","[172, 173]"

c) Phonemic and phonetic restrictions:- /pm/, /k /tn/ never occur word or morpheme initially
- // never occurs word or morpheme initially   There are also restrictions in the consonant clusters that occur word/morpheme initially or finally,
compared to the clusters allowed morpheme medially. Inside reduplicated and compound words, a
much larger set of clusters is allowed than inside morphemes.                  mel-num                     ‘person’
                  body-skin                  muikg-muin                  ‘siblings’
                  sister-brother
The clusters ln and kgm never occur morpheme initially.
Conclusion:
     It seems that in Urim morpheme or root boundaries are more clearly marked than actual word
boundaries. Especially the restrictions of consonant clusters and the operation of the schwa-rule mark
morpheme boundaries. There are boundary marks for word too, but some of them mark both words
and phonological phrases (stress) some only words (rule 8) so that the whole concept of word is
somewhat vague in the language. This makes it difficult to determine exactly which expressions are
compounds, which should be called noun complexes. This reflects in orthography, too. Native
speakers tend to write as one word also those expressions that are grammatically clearly two words
(wanyun etc.). From the other hand, enclitics are usually written separately from the stem (anong ai ‘
to the village’) even when they are pronounced as one phonological word.

2.12.2. Compound Nouns
       Urim has a number of compound noun stems. Most of them are combinations of two nouns, but
  also noun-adjective, adjective-adjective, verb- verb, verb-noun, even noun-pronoun combinations
  occur. Most compound nouns are semantically transparent; both parts are easily recognizable and
  occur also independently. Compared to noun complexes (see 3.1.1), the amount of compound nouns
  is relatively small in Urim. Most animal and plant names for example, are noun complexes. The
  most common noun compounds are semantically plural kinship terms (‘parents, siblings etc.’)

2.12.3. Compound Verbs
     Compounding is a major means of forming verb stems in Urim. The following types of
  compounds have been observed:           1.     Verb-Verb
           2.     Verb-Noun
           3.     Verb-Adv
           4.     Noun-Verb
           5.     Verb-Noun-Verb?
           6.     Verb-Adj-Verb?
           7.     Verb-Noun-Noun      Compound verbs are either verb-verb or (most of them) noun-verb combinations. The auxiliary
  verb ak ‘do’ can be added to these types, which makes the combinations verb-verb-verb or verb-noun-
  verb. Other types of compound verbs are rare. The maximum number of roots observed in a
  compound verb stem is three.","[108, 109, 110, 111]"

    Possibly this structure should be analysed as some kind of appositional structure, not a coherent
noun phrase.
    With relative clauses, the position of demonstrative pronouns varies; sometimes it occurs after the
relative clause, sometimes before it:                  Melnum pa a                pikekg antokg...

                  ‘At the time when we came, we prepared the things ...’
    In the following example, the demonstrative pronoun occurring after the relative clause clearly
refers to a noun inside the relative clause, not to the head noun:                  Tu wrong kiin-a-kipman       wrong wail a         rka     rka      bot pa

                  ‘The big group of people who were in that boat’ (the boat has been mentioned earlier)
3.1.1 Noun Complexes
    In Urim, it is possible to have the head of the noun phrase filled by either a single noun or
sequences of up to three concatenated nouns. These tight sequences of nouns are here termed noun
                                                                                                   125
complexes. Common types of noun complexes are: 1) the sequence of pronoun + noun, and 2) the
sequence of a generic noun followed by a one or more specific noun(s).","[122, 123, 124, 125]"

   In the following examples the clause marked by eng is actually functioning as a modifier of an
NP, much like the relative clause (see the Chapter 5.1):                  Kupm ak-kwap         al-kupm plalng eng            nira wurkapm ak    masin

This is reflected by the many cases where either eng or some other function word can be used without
any great change of meaning. There are also cases when eng occurs in speech but is rejected in good
written language (the fourth example):                  Tu    toplam     nol      eng/la     manto tu         alm               ise

Purpose
    In the following examples eng can be glossed ‘for, to, so that, in order to’. Notice the position of
imperative in the first example; it shows that this eng-clause in fact is embedded. Note that the
purposive interpretation of eng is favored when it governs a clause having irrealis modality                  Kukwa wanyun pa eng tu              kawor       wunen     pa-wo’

   When eng governs a realis clause referring to something that has already happened or is
happening at the moment, it expresses reason or explanation rather than purpose. In the following
examples eng can usually be glossed ‘because’.                 atom ukwa -wel          kul       eng     hapm     yek    ur pikekg            kitn

Reason/Grounds
    Eng is also used to govern subordinate clauses expressing reason or grounds, i.e. why the
preceding clause is uttered, or why the proposition it expresses is valid.","[190, 191, 192]"
