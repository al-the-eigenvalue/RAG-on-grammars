1.6 TYPOLOGY
  Korafe is morphologically agglutinating, primarily hosting suffixes and enclitics. It
exhibits both head-marking and dependent-marking strategies:
                                           head-marking               dependent-marking
                   clauses                 predicates                oblique arguments
                                           auxiliary verbs
                   noun phrases            nouns                     qualifiers
                                                                     possessors
20    In Farr and FaIT ( 1 974:26), this vowel length was interpreted as word tone. And a slight down-glide
      often does accompany the lengthened vowel.
21    There are two other subsidiary rules for the today's past and future tense paradigms that constitute
      exceptions to this general rule. These are: ( I ) stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable when a today's
      past tense verb form has more than two syllables (e.g. seteni 'I said', tendeni ' I lashed', but beni ' I got'),
      and (2) stress perturbs from the initial syllable of the future tense suffix to the second syllable when the
      focused element in the clause is not the verb (e.g. Na yarena ' I will go', Na Tufi yarena ' I will go to
      Tufi. ).
           '
                                                                                Introduction   15   The unmarked order of core constituents i n the clause is subject-object-verb (sov), but
word order of clausal constituents is fairly free with the one stipulation that the verb be last.
In fact, the verb is the only constituent of the clause that obligatorily occurs. Any argument
that is recoverable from the discourse context or the external deictic situation can be elided.
   Korafe distinguishes two major open word classes: nominals and verbs. Nominals
include words that correspond to the categories: noun, qualifier, quantifier, numerator, and
adverb in English. Processes that apply to nominals include inflecting for plurality,
intensity, and/or specific focus, but nominals usually occur without inflections. As is typical
for Papuan languages, verbs are morphologically complex, undergoing agglutinating and
fusional processes which link stems with their corresponding inflections. Verb forms differ
from nominals in the inflectional categories they host, intensification strategies, and the
stress rules that apply to them.
   Closed word classes having referential function in discourse are personal pronouns,
interrogatives/indefinites, and demonstratives-deictics. Other closed word classes include:
postpositions, conjunctions, and sentential focus markers. Interjections, response words and
greetings are numerically limited, but the Korafe repertoire is expanding to include English
interjections and responses.
   Postpositions often cliticise to the preceding noun phrase or sentence base that they
relate to a larger construction or to the discourse deictic context. They function as: ( 1 )
semantic case role markers, (2) markers of pragmatic functions, and (3) modal indicators.
Markers of semantic case roles and pragmatic functions are enumerated, and their
function(s) with noun phrases are specified in Chapter 3. Some combinations of these
postpositions with nominals, personal pronouns, demonstratives, and interrogatives/
indefinites are lexically frozen (e.g. sovenida ' across from' , eloda ' on top of' , ikxida,
dengesida 'beside', all nominals occurring with the general locative postposition da to
specify a position).
   Epistemic and deontic modals terminate sentence bases and left-dislocated themes. The
speaker uses these indicators to declare his or her orientation or attitude towards the deictic
situation detailed. They include: vae 'I'm exasperated', ta ' I ' m annoyed' , lano 'probably
so', tanojo 'perhaps', asi 'certainly (a-si, that-saY.II.evidential indicating reported speech)',
re 'relevant to the immediate deictic situation' and the related demonstrative sets ere, are,
ore which spatially link the event to the speaker, the addressee, or some place away from
both.
   Four personal pronoun stems occur in Korafe: na ' 1 ' , ni 'you' , nu 'he, she,it', and ne
'you (pL)/they' . Frozen combinations of these stems with enclitics are used to make dual
and plural as well as first person inclusive and exclusive distinctions. Only pronominal
stems occur with the actor focus suffix -ne and the limiter -suka 'only ' . The nominal
10/0/1010/0 ' self/selves' is used as a reflexive form or to emphasise the subject in a clause
(which is usually a pronoun). Reciprocal relationships are signalled by t% t% .
   Interrogative and indefinite words arise from four basic stems. Two are basically
pronominal : ave/mave 'who' and re ' what' . The referential specifier -jo (avejo ' who
specifically?') and semantic case role and pragmatic function markers occur with these two
16    Chapter 1pronominal forms. The stem ningi 'which' always combines with forms that are based on
                                                                                          ,
the demonstrative a 'that' (ningia 'which one?'). The verb stem nange 'how (lit. do what)
is the only Korafe verb that may be followed by the comparative postposition go/gao In
content questions, the question word retains the same position in the clause as its
antecedent except in the case of subject where OSV order often occurs.
   All members of the Binandere family manifest the same three-way set of demonstrative
stems: e 'this near the speaker', a 'that near the addressee' , and 0 'that away from both ' .
Markers o f pragmatic functions directly follow demonstratives (amo 'regarding that one',
ava 'that as opposed to any others'). Modal enclitics also occur with the demonstrative set
(amasi 'regarding that certain one'). Semantic case role markers or the pro-verb ge 'do
(FOCUS)' follow one of the pragmatic effector of change markers i or mi (aindae ' on
                                                                          ,
account of that', aminda 'there', aminge 'do thus'). The term 'deictics 22 encompasses the
entire range of demonstrative-based forms.
   Korafe contrasts with some Papuan23 languages in having upwards of 20 conjunctions
and conjunction complexes, which are related to demonstrative forms and/or same-subject
medial verb forms. An inventory of these forms and their functions in co-ranking sentences
is catalogued in Chapter 8. Their function in SRCs is outlined in §6.2.4.
   Sentential focus particles include the negative focus marker jo ' not' , the proposition
specifier nu 'this proposition selected from the available ones', taka 'just, frustratingly' .
Sentential focus words such as avose 'perhaps (lit. that. CT. say)' and avori 'all right (lit.
             ,
that.cT.coP) may also occur in isolation as response words. Other than jo which precedes
the negated constituent in focus, these sentential focus markers either occur sentence­
initially or following the subject and are often set off by pauses from the rest of the
sentence. Tag markers for polar questions (e.g. ai 'yes?', ai tefo 'yes or no?' ) also belong to
this class. However, they are set off at the terminus of the sentence by pauses.
   Interjections (termed yove in Korafe) are a small set of uninflected words and fixed
expressions that the Korafe employ to express emotional reactions (e.g. mara 'what a
shame' , arie ' wow! '). Among the response words and expressions the Korafe use are:
aavori 'that' s sufficient', aii 'yes' , and aiyakoe or tanik yu 'thank you' . Like the sentential
focus particles, interjections and response words may be set off from an accompanying
sentence by pauses; but more normally they are uttered in isolation associated with an
intonation contour that can display considerable pitch variation. Greetings and farewells
(termed ategi in Korafe) occur in isolation or with a vocative expression. The current daily
greeting Sifo eveva! ' Good day ! (lit. day good)' has largely replaced the traditional
greetings using present tense forms of verbs (e.g. /resa! 'You are staying! ' , Refesa! ' You
are coming! ', Ravasi! 'You have slept! '). Command forms of verbs (e.g. Anumbeyo! 'Sit ! ' ,
/yo! ' Go ! ' , A viyo! ' S leep ! ') continue to b e used a s farewells. Interj ections and other
utterances that are shouted at a distance terminate with an -0.","[34, 35, 36]"
"
24   In the juncture that occurs in inalienably possessed kinship terms, when vowels occur at the sandhi, they
     assimilate to each other. Thus, i+a --t e and u+a --t 0, as illustrated in:
       ni 'you' + ai ' mother' --t nei 'your mother' and nu 'he/she' + ai ' mother' --t noi 'his/her/their mother'.
18    Chapter I    Nominals also serve as the base for a number of adverbiaf5 modifiers and modifying
expressions, which function as intensifiers and limiters, verbal and sentential modifiers.
These modifiers are lexicalised combinations of nouns and postpositions (e.g. totoigo
                                                                 ,
' quickly (lit. speed.with.like)', sekago ' again (lit. new.like) . In NPs, intensifiers directly
follow the qualifier or quantifier they modify. When modifying predicates, intensifiers and
other adverbial modifiers precede the predicates.
   In contrast with nominals, most verbs have two stems (I and II). Only stem II forms may
occur with an imperfective morpheme. Serial stem forms and medial verb forms occur in
sentence-medial position and relate in status and temporality to the time of a following final
verb. Final verbs (dependent and independent) host inflections for status/tense-aspect­
mood, person and number of subject, and speech-act value.
    Complex expressions consisting of a nominal and a generic verb such as 'do', ' say' ,
' see', ' hit' , ' spear', 'continue, do again', 'hold' and ' get' are common in Korafe. They
indicate activities (e.g. yaru e '(do) battle', saramana e '(do) work'), inner states (e.g. ivuga
e ' be happy ', riria e 'be excited'), qualities (e.g. fakina e 'be strong'), and time (ungobu
erira ' it is becoming late afternoon', tumbajirira 'night has fallen'). Some are semantically
opaque: dubo bu ' love (lit. neck get)"" eghovo fakara e 'to set one's resolve (lit. chin hard
do) ' .
   As is common in Papuan languages, Korafe makes extensive use of chaining
                                                                            ,,
constructions, in which verbal constituents are in a ""coordinate-dependent 2 6 relationship.
Serial verb constructions (SYcs), formed by the serialisation of verb stems with a terminal
medial or final verb, commonly occur as a constituent of medial verb chaining
constructions, termed switch-reference constructions (SRCS). SRCs indicate the following
relationships between adjacent clauses: ( 1 ) a temporal sequencing or overlap relationship
and (2) identity or non-identity of subject. Co-lexicalised and periphrastic sequences of
serial and medial verbs act as a unit to encode direction-movement, cause-effect,
completion of activity, rhythmic iteration and other semantic notions and aspects.
   Information is structured in sentences by the order of arguments and by pragmatic
markers. Although SOY is the default clausal order of core arguments in a clause, OSY
occurs when the object has pragmatic topic function and the subject pragmatic focus
function. In most of these instances, one of the two arguments is additionally marked by a
postposition indicating its pragmatic function, which often cliticises to a demonstrative:
(a) mo 'that (topic/theme)', (a)va 'that (contrastive theme/focus) ' (a) i/(a) imi 'that
(contrastive and controlling theme/focus)' . These markers also link dependent bases to
independent bases in co-ranking hypotactic sentence arrangements where each base
terminates with a final verb. These dependent bases are basically the topical 'point of
departure' that provides the context within which the independent base is operative.
Corresponding to adverbial clauses, relative clauses and complement clauses in English,25   There is one word ufena 'secretly', which is of uncertain origin, but has adverbial function. A few
     adverbial modifiers are derived from verbs. Manner can be encoded by negative deverbal forms such as
     sembae 'wrongly (lit. not cross)'. The notion of manner can also be encoded by the initial verb in some
     SVcs.
26   This term is from Foley ( 1 986: 1 77).
                                                                             Introduction   19they realise the protasis in conditional sentences, the frustrated proposition i n adversative
sentences, the result in result-reason sentences, and also the unembedded, internally­
headed 'relative constructions' in Korafe. Dependent bases that are not set off by pauses
embed as complements or relative clauses within the independent base.
    The chaining sentence structure has received much attention in the literature on Papuan
languages. However, it is not the only sentential option available to Korafe. The co-ranking
sentence structure, in which each base terminates with a final verb, is also employed by the
Korafe. Co-ranking structures manifest either hypotactic relationships, like those mentioned
in the previous paragraph, or paratactic relationships, where both bases are independent and
linked by a coordinating conjunction. The Korafe make use of both structures in
conversation and in oral and written discourse.
   Chaining structures are designed to relate information that depends on temporal
succession. In chaining constructions, noun phrases that are recoverable from the discourse
or deictic context are elided. This reduction in noun phrases brings with it a corresponding
focus on the events represented by the verbs in chaining structures. The order of the verbs
in chaining structures is non-reversible and mirrors the order of the events they represent in
the real world. This tense-iconic focus on events makes chaining structures choice vehicles
for expressing the foregrounded story-line in narratives, legends, procedures, and portions
of other discourses in which iconic ordering is a key feature.
   Co-ranking sentences are juxtaposed or joined by conjunctions, which encode logical
relationship·s between the bases. These structures o ften expound descriptive and
explanatory discourses. They are also utilised for argumentation in hortatory and epistolary
discourses. Background information in tense-iconic discourses often is given by suspending
the chaining structure and using co-ranking structures.","[37, 38, 39]"

3 .2 FUNCTIONS
     NPS function at three levels: syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic.
   The syntactic functions of N Ps are the structural relationships (e.g. subject, object) they
have in clauses and sentences, reflected in their marking, constituent order and concord
relationships.
   Semantic functions specify the roles (e.g. agent, patient, benefactive, locative) that NP
referents play within an activity or state of affairs.
   Pragmatic functions specify the nature of the information NPs communicate, i.e. the
speaker's topic and the salient information to be communicated. This takes into account the
world view of the speech-act participants, their current state of knowledge, and their spatial
and temporal perspectives. Those entities that are controlling or effecting change in a
situation or being changed or contrasted with other entities are also pragmatically marked.
    Syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic functions are signalled by coding devices. Korafe
segmental coding devices include: ( 1 ) cross-referencing of person and number of subject on
verbs, (2) NP markers and (3) word order and equi-NP deletion. Suprasegmental coding
devices include: (4) pauses and (5) placement of stress in future final verb forms and accent
in intonation contours.",[101]

                                                                                                          INTRODUCTION ( TUTURO)              1.1 AIM, SCOPE AND THEORETICAL ORIENTATION
                This book compares and contrasts the structure and functions of three types of complex
             constructions in Korafe, a language spoken in the Oro Province of Papua New Guinea.
             These three constructions are: (1) serial verb constructions (svcs), (2) switch-reference
             constructions (SRCS), and (3) co-ranking constructions (CRCs). SVCs and SRCS contrast with
             co-ranking constructions in the types of information they present and in the communicative
             goals they are designed to accomplish. These constructions are central to the organisation
             of Korafe discourse.
                To facilitate an understanding of the structure of the complex constructions, a brief
             overview of morphological and syntactic structures is provided. Verbs and their
             morphology are outlined in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 summarises the structure and functions of
             noun phrases and the related postpositional phrases, and Chapter 4 presents predications,
             polarity and basic sentences/sentential modes.
                Chapters 5, 6, and 7 detail the features of the two 'chaining' structures, SVCs and SRCS.
             Chaining structures terminate with a verb of fuller structure than the preceding verbal
             constituents, which are verb stems in SVCs and medial verb forms in SRCs. These verbal
             predicates are normally linked by juxtaposition and may occur with arguments. However,
             syntactic constraints marked on or implicit in chaining structures enable the speaker to
             monitor subject reference from verb to verb without using very many overt noun phrases.
             SVCs are the focus of Chapter 5. The rules governing the structure and argument-tracking
             system of SRCs are given in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 examines some discrepancies in linear
             argument tracking in Korafe SRCs.
                Co-ranking constructions are the focus of Chapter 8. In co-ranking constructions, all the
             constituents terminate with verbs of the same rank, namely final verbs, or in topic-comment
             constructions, predicate complements. Co-ranking constructions combine clauses, SRCS,
             and/or other co-ranking sentences by juxtaposing or conjoining them. Bases are syntactically
             related to each other by parataxis or hypotaxis. A common pragmatic relationship
             expressed by bases in co-ranking constructions is the theme-rheme relationship. Sentence
             examples exhibit additive, alternative, adversative, concessive, implicational, cause-effect,
             reason-result semantic relationships. They also are used to indicate direct and indirect
             quotations and thoughts, as well as relative and complement constructions.
               Discussion in Chapter 9 centres around verb and clause sequences that are units,
             semantically and intonationally. A number of co-lexicalised and periphrastic sequences ofFarr, C.J.M. The Interface between Syntax and Discourse in Korafe: A Papuan Language of Papua New Guinea.

2    Chapter 1verbs (including medial verbs that are the predicates of distinct clauses) are found in
Korafe. These units convey semantic notions such as direction+motion, posture+state,
cause+effect, manner+action, iteration at uneven intervals and rhythmic iteration. These
predictable verb sequences are integrated into the structure of a unit, here termed the
thematic clause chain unit (TCCU). TCCUs represent the speaker' s chunking of information
into intonational pause-free units.
   Chapter 1 0 compares the use of chaining and co-ranking constructions in discourse. A
prototypical chaining paragraph is contrasted with a prototypical thematic paragraph. It
outlines the discourse structure rules that characterise discourses in general and
differentiate discourse genres, making use of tense-iconic chaining structures and logically
ordered 'thematic' structures as well as speech formulas. It concludes with a delineation of
some common scripts that are threaded into the warp and woof of Korafe discourses.
   Devices encoding cohesion and prominence in Korafe discourse are the focus of Chapter
11.
   This study is designed to enrich the growing corpus of data on Papuan languages, which
are still under-represented in typological and theoretical accounts of the languages in the
world. It builds on the research of many of my colleagues in the Summer Institute of
Linguistics' as well as that of others analysing Papuan languages ? It expands on those
frontiers in the following ways:
1.   It identifies a Korafe unit between clause and sentence which plays an important role in
     structuring the flow of information in Korafe discourse. This unit is the thematic clause
     chain unit (TCCU) and corresponds to Pawley and Syder' s ( 1 983 :202) ""fluent unit"" and
     Chafe ' s ( 1 987:22) ""intonation unit"". It is defined by phonological, grammatical and
     semantic criteria.
2.   It shows how the Korafe use personal pronouns as a contrastive focus device and as
     markers of TCCU onsets.
3.   It details the features of chaining and co-ranking structures and shows how they
     contrast in their discourse functions.
4.   It argues that canonical SRCs convey foregrounded events in tense-iconic discourses.
     There are two special cases that are accounted for in this description: ( 1 ) discrepancies
     in the switch-reference anticipatory coding system and (2) simultaneous and sequencing
     durative medial verb forms that appear to realise clauses in tense-iconic SRC sequences.
5.   It shows how discourses in Korafe cohere. It describes that cohesion in terms of
     Givan's ( 1 987: 1 79, 1 990a:827 and Givan, ed. 1 983) suggested parameters of discourse
     continuity: ( 1 ) temporal, locational, participant and action continuity in tense-iconic
     discourses, and (2) thematic continuity in thematically-oriented discourses.","[20, 21, 22]"
"
34     In order to categorise these nominal + verb complex expressions as either lexemes or products of
       syntactic rules, one must determine what constitutes the lexicon. According to Pawley ( 1 985 : 86,
       1 986:98-1 04, 1 1 6), grammarians and lexicographers differ in their conceptualisation of the lexicon. The
       grammarians' lexicon ""contains all and only the unpredictable pairings of form and meaning, i.e.
       morphemes and various sorts of idioms"". The lexicographers' lexicon includes ""any composite form if it
       is a common usage, i.e. it if is recognised by members of the language community as a standard way of
       referring to a familiar concept or conceptual situation"". The lexicographers' conceptualisation is
       preferred in this work.

                 NOUN PHRASES: THEIR STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS3 . 1 STRUCTURE
  Korafe has several types of noun phrases (NPS). These include: headless noun phrases,
noun phrases headed by personal pronouns, conjoined noun phrases, juxtaposed and
summarising noun phrases.
   Korafe also has a number of complement and relative constructions that function as
heads or modifiers ofNPs.
3 . l . l STANDARD NPS
   Standard NPs occur with an obligatory head, an optional pre-head and four optional post­
head modifying constituents. 1 The head consists of a noun or a nominal compound. The
                                                                                             2
pre-head constituent is a possessive modifier, realised by a genitive postpositional phrase.
The post-head modifying constituents describe the nominal head or position it deictically.
The post-head modifying constituents are ordered as follows: one to two qualifiers or
qualifier phrases, one quantifier or quantifier phrase and a determiner.3 The structure of the
standard N P is set out in Table 3 . 1 .
             TABLE 3. 1 : STRUCTURE OF THE KORAFE STANDARD NOUN PHRASE    Pre-head:          Head:                                Post-head:

    (possessor)        noun/nominal compound                (qualifier 1 - ) (quantifier) ( determiner)Although the above table gives the potential constituents, Korafe standard NPs are not
found with more than four modifying constituents and do not usually occur with more than      Korafe is not unusual among Papuan languages in having pre-head genitive and post-head attributive
      modifiers (cf. Foley 1 986:85 [Yimas], Reesink 1 987: 1 20- 1 22 [Usan], Roberts 1 987:84-87 [Amele] as
      well as the Binandere family languages).
2
      Postpositional phrases have the general constituent structure:
          NP=postposition, e.g. gagara=da 'of the girl' or gagara eveva=da 'of the good girl ' .
      Postpositions cliticise (marked b y =) t o the final constituent i n the N P . Postpositions with heavy
      [(c)vv] syllables or two syllables may occur with word stress on their initial syllable. Postpositional
      phrases are detailed more fully in §3.2.
3
      This order accords with the universals # 1 8, # 1 9 and #20 that Greenberg ( 1 963:58-90) suggests for SOy
      languages. As was stated in Chapter 1 , nominals constitute a major word category that includes nouns,
      qualifiers and quantifiers among its subcategories. Although undifferentiated morphologically, nouns
      differ from qualifiers and quantifiers in distribution and in number of semantic properties.

68     Chapter 3two. Examples 3 . l to 3 .4 are typical N Ps which are taken from texts. In example 3 . l , two
qualifying modifiers follow the head in the NP.
3.l     [[ika ]HEAD     ghousa teria]NP
          tree          long       large
        'a tall, large tree'
In example 3 .2, the nominal head koromane ' older brothers' is modified by two
constituents, a possessor preceding it and a qualifier following it. The possessor is a
genitive postpositional phrase.3 .2    [[gagara=da]O EN Pp          [koro=mane]HEAD          etoto]NP
          girl=GEN               older.brother=PL             two
        'the two older brothers of the girl'
The NP in example 3 . 3 has a compound nominal head and four modifying constituents. A
possessor in the form of a genitive postpositional phrase precedes the head, and a qualifier,
a quantifier, and a demonstrative follow it.
3.3     [nunda        [ambo+jimbi]HEAD beka             12 a] NP

        'those 1 2 genuine disciples of his'
   Standard NPs have the following phonological characteristics. They are unbroken by
pauses, occurring within one rhythm unit. They usually contain one word that receives
heavier stress on its inherently stressed syllable than the other words. 4 This heavy stress or
accent S is manifested by increased intensity (amplitude) and/or a higher pitch, together with
length. Accent often falls on the final constituent in Korafe NPs. For example, the word that
is accented in the NP in example 3 .4 is e'/oto 'two ' . Accent in an intonational contour is
symbolised by ( : ).3 .4    gagara=da koro=mane                    e'tolo
        girl=GEN     older.brother=PL two
        'the two older brothers of the girl'
When the final constituent is itself a phrase, as in example 3 . 5 , the accent falls on the head
of the phrase.
3.5     [baundari [e'tolo        naka]]NP
         boundary two            in.all
        'two boundaries'4      Pike ( 1 945:27,34) defines 'rhythm units' as stretches of speech ""spoken with a single rush of syllables
       uninterrupted by a pause"". Innate stress is the normal stress each polysyllabic word and some
       monosyllabic words occurring in phrases receive, in accordance with Korafe word stress rules.
       The term 'accent' is utilised in addition to the term 'stress' to reflect a distinction which Bolinger
       ( 1 972b:22) makes between phrase or sentence stress and word stress. The inherently stressed syllable
       in a word is its stressed syllable; it receives word stress. The stressed syllable in a word that is
       important in a sentence or phrase is more heavily stressed or accented than inherently stressed
       syllables in other words.

pattern from other nominal compounds and noun phrases. Because the initial constituent
encodes contrastively significant information, the accent falls on it rather than on the
terminal constituent, as examples 3 .6 and 3 . 7 show.

    Nouns and nominal compounds function as heads of standard NPS.
   Two nominals (i.e. noun + noun, noun + modifier/ modifier + noun) form compounds
that usually remain separate words phonologically, i.e. retain their word stress. 8
Duplication of nominals as in boanda boanda ' each one's portion (lit. portion portion)' is
one form of compounding. Other Korafe nominal compounds (see examples 3 . 8a-e) appear
to be taxonomic sets indicating ways the people classify items in their ethnography. In
many of these sets, the second member is considered to be more prominent by the Korafe.

            Pronouns also are heads of NPS, but they occur without pre-head modifiers and qualifier post-head
            modifiers. Like NPS , sentential complements and relative clauses and clause sequences in Korafe
            function as subject and object in matrix clauses and as left-dislocated themes in sentences. However,
            they cannot occur with the range of modifiers that the standard noun phrase does. They are discussed
            in §3 . 1 .7 and Chapter 8, §8. 1 0 and §8. 1 1 .
            The modifier constituent in noun + modifier compounds may be either a qualifier or a quantifier
            nominal. In modifier + noun compounds, it is a qualifier nominal, a deverbal or a noun, acting as a
            modifier.
            Of the criteria that Pike ( 1 947: 1 67) lists for identifying compounds, the following apply to Korafe
            nominal compounds. ( I ) All compounds occur in fixed order without any pause between the segments.
            (2) Some can be inflected for plurality as a unit. (3) Only the stressed syllable of one of the
            components, usually the last one, is given additional stress intensity, which often coincides with a
            higher pitch than all the syllables of the other components manifest.

as several nouns compound with kalolkakalo 'an implement or person characterised as
habitually performing the activity' , as in 3 . 1 3 a-c.
3 . 1 3a.      gembari 'kalo     'writing implement'
       b.      isoro ka'kalo     'soldiers'
       c.      oka bambari 'kalo 'fishing afficionado'
   Korafe has a number of modifier + noun combinations, in which the modifier classifies
or identifies the modified noun. The modifier can be a qualifier (3 . 1 4), a deverbal (3 . l 5) or
a noun (3 . 1 6). The preceding qualifier eveva in 3 . l 4a specifies five species of trees (e.g.
benomba, Octomeles sumatiana ) that make superb canoe logs. In 3 . 1 4b, the postposing
qualifier eveva praises a specific canoe' s design.
3 . l 4a. [E'veva ghaka]NP          jeli-sira.
              good canoe         chop.II-DP.3S.FN

             ' Kenneth' s canoe is a good canoe. '
     Deverbals distinguish the homonyms, sino 'dog' and sino 'drum' in example 3 . l 5a, b.
3 . 1 5a. gam'b-ari         sino             b.   dtv-ari       sino

             'a biting dog'                       'a drum for singing and dancing'
                                                                             Noun phrases     71I n example 3 . 1 6a,b, two types o f pigs are differentiated by preceding modifying nouns.
3 . 1 6a.    'taima fuka             b.   'nati   fuka
             bush pig                     village pig
             'wild pig'                   'domesticated pig'
   A number of modifier + noun combinations have colexicalised and are used as names of
entities i.e. ujavi fiyogha ' seahorse (lit. swimming medicine)' or classes of entities, i.e.
Jetari mose ' old maid (lit. standing-waiting mature unmarried female). ' Others are used
innovatively. For example, the terminal noun embo 'person' remains constant in all the
examples given in 3 . 1 7; the noun modifier varies.
3 . 1 7a.    A'merika embo     'American'
      b.     KoI!:ife embo     ' Korafe person'
      c.     Baga embo         ' Baga villager'
      d.     'kae embo         'sick person (lit. poison person)'
      e.     'oka bambari embo ' fisherman (lit. fish getting person)'
Example 3 . 1 7e indicates that a deverbal nominal compound, i.e. oka bambari ' getting fish'
can itself be used as the classifying modifier in another nominal compound. The same is
true in example 3 . 1 8 with the deverbal combination dubo bari ' love (lit. neck getting)' used
as a classifying modifier. In this example, it is the classifying modifier that remains stable
in the three contexts. As 3 . 1 8c i llustrates, both classifier and classified are nominal
compounds themselves, arising from recursive compounding.
3 . 1 8a. nanda     'dubo+b-ari       mandi
            1 S.GEN neck+get.I-DYB boy
            ' my favourite son'
3 . 1 8b. nunda     'dubo +bari       bayau
            3S.GEN neck+get.I-DYB food
            ' his favourite food'
3 . 1 8c . namane =da      'dubo+bari         nano+namendi
            1 PL.EXC=GEN neck+get.I-DYB older.brother+younger.brother
            ' our beloved brothers'
   All classifier + noun sequences are a distinctive group differentiated from both NPs and
other nominal compounds by their accent which falls on the inherently stressed syllable of
the classifier constituent, not on the terminal constituent. Both innovative and lexicalised
classifier + nominal compounds manifest the following four characteristics of compound
nominal heads. ( 1 ) They must occur j uxtaposed in fixed order with no words or pauses
intervening. (2) Some of them can be inflected for plurality as a unit. (3) The classifying
modifiers in these compounds do not occur in headless NPs. (Modifiers that are
unambiguously NP constituents occur in headless NPs, as discussed in §3 . 1 .2.) (4) These
classifying modifiers cannot be intensified; post-head modifiers in NPs can be.
72      Chapter 33 . 1 . 1 .2 SOME NOTES ON MODIFYING CONSTITUENTS
   The pre-head constituent, the possessor, can itself be the possessum of another
possessor. In such a case, the construction contains two genitive postpositional phrases, one
within another, as example 3 . l 9 illustrates.
3.l9     nangae=da gagarako=da                       gomo
         I D=GEN      younger.sister=GEN grave.plot
         ' our younger sister' s grave mound'
  Nominal compounds can function as po st-head qualifiers. In example 3 .20, the
compound kasoko agho ' dipnet handle' has lexicalised to signify 'extremely thin' .3 .20    [sino]HEAD       [kasoko+agho]QUALIFIER
          dog          dip.net+handle
         ' an extremely thin dog'
Example 3 . 2 1 has two post-head qualifiers.9 The second qualifier IS a lexicalised
nominal+qualifier expression: ata ghoghousa 'tall (lit. long legs) ' .
3.21     [[nati]HEAD babai [[[ata]HEAD ghoghousa ]QUALIFIER l O a]NP]
          house        big.PL leg                  10ng.RED                     1 0 that
         'those ten tall, large houses'
   Both post-head qualifiers and quantifiers may be modified. Qualifiers are modified to
indicate scalar proportions. Contrary to Greenberg's universal #2 1 , even though Korafe has
OV order, all Korafe adverbial modifiers like beka 'really ' , eni ' one', futo 'too much' ,
ambari 'exhaustive (lit. dying)' and ambari ekolambarako ' awfully exhaustive' follow the
qualifying modifiers.
3.22a. ghousa beka                      b.    ghousa amb-ari            eko
       long   true                            long     die. I-DVB bad
       ' very long'                           ' stupendously long'
The lone exception is the downtoner itako 'a little bit' which precedes qualifiers it
modifies, as in example 3 .23.
3 .23    Roera itako bouvu fumbu!
         thing a.bit heavy shoulder.S.IMP
         ' Carry something a bit heavier! '
   The numerators etoto 'two ' , etodaba 'three' and avononde ' four' may be modified by
the restrictive quantifier nakti: etoto nakti 'two (of them) all told'. The quantifier isambu
can be additionally modified by a numerator: isambu 1 0 'ten in all ' .
  Qualifiers conjoined by Ii ' and' o r 0 ' or' occur more often than juxtaposed qualifiers in
NPS. Example 3 .24 illustrates conjoining of qualifiers by Ii 'and' .","[86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"
"These structures make use of four pragmatic functions : THEME, TOPIC, FOCUS and TA IL.
THEME and TAIL are external to the predication proper and occupy the special positions, P2
and P3 respectively. TOPIC and FOCUS are internal functions of the predication. In the
schema that Dik ( 1 979:2 1 ) proposes, the P I position is ""taken by elements from special
categories of constituents (e.g. questions words) or is used for constituents with Topic or
Focus function"" . In Korafe, when a TOPIC NP is overtly present in predications terminating
with verbs, it is always in the PI initial position in the predication. But a constituent bearing
FOC U S function may not necessarily be in the initial P I position. In the second Korafe
pragmatic structure, FOCUS is normally associated with the COMMENT constituent.
   The THEME in P2 position is external to the main clause, preceding it, phonologically
separated from it by a pause. Dik's definition of THEME dovetails with Chafe's ( 1 976:50)
definition of ' Chinese topics' : ""the topic sets a spatial, temporal, or individual framework
within which the main predication holds"".
   The TOPIC in P I position is internal to the main clause. It is ""the entity ' about' which the
predication specifies something in the given setting"" ( 1 976:50). TOPIC NPs are marked by
rno in Korafe as ""the starting point of the utterance"" (Brown and Yule 1 983 : 1 26) when no
contrast is involved and { irni} or {va} when contrast is involved.
   The THEME overlaps with the TOPIC in the type of information it conveys, but THEMEs
do not ever function as clausal subjects. Neither the THEME nor the TOPIC are required to
have selectional restrictions with the verb, but the TOPIC is sometimes the syntactic subject
of the clause. As subject, its person and number are cross-referenced by the predicating
verb. Most Korafe sentences have either a THEME or a TOPIC; some have both, but some
have only the comment element. In example 3 .94, the P2:THEME function realised by
orokoe ' nowadays', and the P I :TOPIC realised by ogha rno 'the crow' reference distinct
semantic entities. The THEME provides the temporal setting for the sentence, and the TOPIC
(ogha) has subject function in the clause in which it occurs.
3 .94 [Oroko=e, hHEME [ogha=rnohoPlc Kofure ir-ira.
       today=this       crow=T/F        Kofure remain-PRES.3S.FN
      ' [Nowadays,hHEME [crowshoPlc live at Kofure. '22    The initial pragmatic structure i s abstracted for Korafe from Dik's ( 1 978: 1 9-2 1 ) language independent
      preferred order of constituents ( UPOC) . The UPOC structure that Dik proposes has this format: P2, PI
      (v) S (V ) 0 (v), P3, in which ""s and 0 stand for the neutral or unmarked positions of Subject and
      Object. The Vs indicate the possible positions of (finite and infinite) verbs. P I , P2, and P3 indicate
      'special positions' used for special purposes, and the commas stand for breaks in the intonation"" (Dik
      1 978:2 1 ).
          It should be noted that Korafe switch-reference constructions (SRCS) can occur with large numbers
      of clauses (i.e. (TOPIC) (s) (0) v). Up to 27 have been found in one sentence. SRCS can also manifest
      more than one instance of the entire set of constituents from P2 through to p) with several clauses in
      between.
          Korafe also distinguishes a pragmatic structure centred around a verbless or copular TOPIC­
      COMMENT clause, which is represented by the second formula. The occurrence of more than two
      TOPIC-COMMENT clauses in one sentence is rare. Sentence-internal TOPIC-COMMENT clauses often
      occur without the copula.
96      Chapter 3   In example 3 .95, both P2:THEME and P l :TOPIC functions reference the same semantic
entity. Personal pronouns commonly occur in Korafe as TOPICs copying the T H E M E
constituent. The main clause in this example has TOPIC-COMMENT structure, terminating
with a copula instead of a verb.","[115, 116]"

4. 1 .2 GENERAL PROPERTIES OF CLAUSES WITH V ERBAL PREDICATES
   Korafe verbal predicates follow the syntactic arguments (core and oblique NPS) in verbal
clauses. Constituent order in Korafe verbal clauses is governed by pragmatic constraints,
rather than being fixed syntactically. Only the verb-final position is rigidly adhered to.
Verbal clauses that can manifest only one core argument, the subject NP, are intransitive.
Those that can manifest two core arguments, the subject NP and another unmarked NP with
object function, are transitive clauses. Although SOy represents the unmarked order of core
constituents in transitive verbal clauses, other configurations (i.e. 0 S V , S V , 0 v , v) also
occur. Oblique arguments may also be ' sprinkled' throughout verbal clauses. This non­
configurational structure can be represented as:        (NP)n + V [+subject marked],
1 12     Chapter 4in which NP includes PP (postpositional phrases) and on' indicates 0-5 arguments ? Clauses
occur with three unmarked (or core) arguments under certain conditions, detailed in §4.4.4
and its accompanying sub-sections. Clauses may be bounded by pauses.
   Korafe has a number of verbs that can be used as predicates of both transitive and
intransitive clauses.4 For instance, the verb averege 'overflow, pour' in example 4.5 is
ambi-transitive.
          INTRANSITIVE:
4.5a.     Uvu averege              vovos-er-ira.
          water overflow/pour. J descend. II-IPF-PRES.3S.FN
          ' Water is overflowing and running down.'
          TRANSITIVE:
4.5b.     Uvu averege.         mind-one!
          water pour.(2S).IMP eaU-I R. I S. H
          ' Pour (me some) water that I may drink.'
In the above example, it is clear that the NP expressed by uvu 'water' has S function i n 4.5a
and 0 function in 4. 5b, i .e . s(intransitive subject)=o. Other Korafe verbs that function as
one-place and two-place predicates in which s(intransitive subject)=o include: beje 'break,
shatter' , lise ' shred/disintegrate' , degage 'break in two ' , sarige 'split', avi 'be burned, (fire,
sun) burn (entity) ' , birurughe ' turn, twist' , Jeunghe 'bob, toss a canoe up and down' and de
' hit, contact another surface forcefully' . Among the ambitransitive verbs in which S can be
either transitive or intransitive are: junge ' hide', du 'fall/place down on ground' , divu 'sing
(song), dance (dance)' and jovereghe ' turn over, turn around' . Perception predicates and
impersonal predicates conveying psychological responses are also expressed by two
separate role frames, depending on the semantico-pragmatic nature of the particular event
being encoded. Perception predications are the focus of §4.4.2, and impersonal predications
are detailed in §4.4.3 . Since benefactive or locative oblique arguments can be promoted to
the participatory locus role, predications with them also manifest two separate valencies,
depending on the situation being described.","[131, 132]"

II           The occurrence of pauses and pause words tends to correlate with clause boundaries in Korafe,
             although not all Korafe clauses are bordered by pauses and thematic NPs and PPS can be bordered by
             pauses. Giv6n ( l 990b:44-46) suggests similar findings for Tok Pisin, Tairora, and Kalam. The latter
             two are Papuan languages in the Eastern Highlands and Madang Provinces respectively.

5.5 SOME NOTES ON GRAMMATICI SATION IN KORAFE SVCs
   It is possible that some of the SS medial verbs have arisen in a grammaticisation process
involving serial verbs that have been reanalysed as grammatical functors. (Refer to §2.2.)
The verb stems do ' leave off and se ' say' are either homophonous with the markers of
sequencing and overlap relations indicated on terminal verbs in marking clauses or they
have grammaticised as the markers of these relationships. Given that the entire Binandere
family uses the same lexical verb stems to encode these relationships, grammaticisation is
feasible. (Refer to footnotes 13 and 15 in Chapter 2.) SS sequencing medial forms appear to
be combinations of stem I or stem II forms of verbs with do ' leave off , e.g. sedo 'say and' ,
gembudo ' weave and', avido 'dry and', sido (yarena) '( 1 will g o along) repeatedly saying
and' . The verb stem se ' say' apparently combines with stem II forms of the verb, yielding
SS simultaneous medial verb forms, such as sise 'while saying ' , gefuse 'while weaving' ,
and avise 'while drying' .
   Unlike African languages which have reanalysed verb stems as markers o f object and
case roles and as complementisers (Lord 1 993 :9-2 1 3), verb stems in Korafe, for the most
part, have not grammaticised as case role markers. As was discussed in the previous
section, the verb stem bu ' get' has not grammaticised, becoming solely an instrument
marker. It still contributes its full lexical value to SVCS in which it is a constituent.
   However, the verb ghe has several senses, some of which are 'grammatical' . The verb
ghe can mean ' move from' or ' continue doing'. Its aspectual use in encoding iteration at
irregular intervals and/or sequences of events performed as a habitual routine is discussed
in §9.2.4. 1 .2 . Together with the locative postposition da or placenames, it also encodes the
notion of source, occurring in both SVCS (as ghe) and SRCs (as ghedo). This is illustrated by
the combination sekarada ghe ' (move) from the coral head' in example 5 .44. The
postpositional phrase, sekara dengesida 'beside the coral head ' , illustrates the inessive
locative use of da.
5 .44   ... evetako-i      sekara=da      ghf                  buvu-do
            old.woman-CEFF coral.head=LOC move.from.I          arrive. I-SEQ.SS
        sekara           dengesi=da anumb+ir-iri . . .
        coral.head side=LOC           sit+remain-SIM.R.3 S.DS
        , . . . the old woman emerged from the coral head reef rock and while she
        was sitting next to it. . . '
    Although Korafe does not have any verb stems that have grammaticised as the indicator
of cause, iconically ordered verb sequences have the potential for encoding cause-and­
effect relationships. Example 5.45 illustrates one of the instances where an SVC manifests
this relationship. The stones used as the house' s foundation are both the object put in place
(jiti) and the subject of the verb vitira ' it ascended'.
5 .45   Dobo=da        tutumbi=mo, ghamana=i jiti vit-ira.
        shelter=LOC post=TIF           rock=CEFF put.! ascend.I-TP.3S.FN
        ' As the foundation (posts) of the house, the stones (that) he put in position
        piled up (on top of each other). '
                                                                                                 SVCs     1 73However, switch-reference constructions (SRCs) are normally used to encode thi s
relationship in Korafe, because cause and effect situations commonly involve a switch i n
subject i n which the object referent of the initial predicate becomes the referent of the
subject in the following predicate. In 5 .46 an SRC with the predicatesjighiri ambesi ' (who)
peformed (sorcery on you) and you died?' expresses cause and effect.

290   Chapter 9include in addition to a generative grammar: ( 1 ) a dictionary of subject matter lexemes,
(2) a system of discourse rules incorporating a body of speech formulas, each with its own
grammar and (3) an ethnography of discourse. This chapter and the next are a preliminary
attempt to apply the subject matter language construct in a limited way to Korafe.
   Subject matter lexemes consist chiefly of names and terms, i.e. ""expressions that native
speakers recognise as conventional and institutionalised and which substitute for part of
speech categories (N , V , etc.)"" (Pawley 1 986: I 03). This would include not only the
morphemes and idioms present in the ' grammarian' s lexicon' , but also the well-formed
complex and compound words that are typically included as dictionary entries in
lexicographer's dictionaries, e.g. brotherliness, forgettable, forgetful, forgetfulness.
   Speech formulas are ""conventional ways of saying things for definable discourse
purposes"" (Pawley 1 994:7). Prototypical speech formulas are ""bundles of at least seven
components: meaning, grammar, lexical form, naturalness (idiomaticity) constraints,
discourse function, discourse context, and prosody or musical conventions. Built into each
formula is a specification of what to say, when to say it, how to say it and why"" (Pawley
1 995 : 7-8). A gestural component is also obligatory for speech formulas used by speech-act
participants face-to-face.
   Pawley ( 1 9 83 :88-95, 1 994 : 1 4- 1 8) distinguishes fixed, semiproductive, and productive
speech formulas. Formulas that are fixed occur with invariant lexical content and word
order. Examples from English include: A rolling stone gathers no moss!, A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush! The formula Good day! is a typical greeting. God bless you! is
often said when someone sneezes.
   Semiproductive formulas occur with severe constraints on the variation. An example is:
What in the name of NP!, used to express extreme annoyance, where there are only a few
acceptable variations of the NP constituent. Two are: What in the name of blue blazes! and
What in the name of heaven!
   Productive formulas are constructions whose lexical content is only partly specified.
Some English formulas are : NPi turned on NP;S heel, The ADJi-er (x) the ADJi/j (Y)! as in The
sooner he leaves town, the better! or The sooner you start, the sooner you 'll be done!, NPi
got NPis nose(s) all out ofjoint, NPi is out to get NP/ Many variables can realise the NPs and
ADJs in exponents of these formulas. Often the tense of the verb can change, as in the
following token of the final formula above: John was out to get Charlie.
   The ethnography of discourse involves ""identifying discourse genres and relating each to
wider systems of knowledge and rules of behaviour, and specifying the discourse structure
rules for each genre"" Pawley ( 1 994:20). Discourse structure rules ""specify an agenda of
things that may be said with an order in which they may be said"" ( 1 994 : 1 8).
   In Korafe, expressions describing most conventional activities consist largely of
sequences of verbs. In order to speak Korafe idiomatically, one must memorise these
standardised verb sequences and master the rules governing their use in discourse. Failure
to do so will hamper not only one ' s fluency in Korafe, but also one ' s ability to apply
syntactic processes like negation correctly to such verb sequences. Without this knowledge,
one is likely to omit verbs that should be included and insert NPs where ellipsis is required.

formedness in the production of these standardised sequences. Although one might classify
such sequences as idioms, most standardised verb sequences in Korafe are syntactically and
semantically well-formed.
   The focus in this chapter is threefold: ( 1 ) on those verb sequences that rank as subject
matter lexemes, (2) on those clause sequences used as speech formulas and (3) on the
utilisation of subject-matter lexemes, speech formulas, and free expressions in shaping
units, called thematic clause chain units (TCCUS), that package information in a discourse
framework.","[309, 310, 311]"
"
19    An examination of the apparent anomalies in Korafe might give rise to the hypothesis that the lack of
      overt referential marking on ss medial verbs facilitates their use in these apparently anomalous cases.
      However, the default reading of these forms is ss following, and it is the very discrepancy in
      referential marking between what is expected and what actually occurs that signals the anomaly.
           This hypothesis is also discounted for many other Papuan languages, in which os medial verbs that
      are overtly marked are also used to register apparent anomalies. For instance, Roberts ( 1 988a: l 06-
      1 1 0) gives Amele examples where anomalies registered by os medial verbs express thematic breaks,
      i.e. shifts in time, place, and/or world settings and surprise changes.
           Korafe handles such thematic shifts by using left-dislocated NPs or PI'S as global themes marked by
      pragmatic topic markers (rna, va and iml) and followed by pauses.
           Olson ( 1 98 1 :298-306) describes several switch-reference markers (ga, gana, moga, koga) that have
      similar function in Barai. These markers indicate a switch of thematic topic, even when the local topic
      remains the same, and they often affect several clauses. They do not monitor switch-reference.
242      Chapter 7   Thus, it is not always the subject, the agent, or the topic that plays the pivotal role in
determining the marking of referential switches in Korafe S R Cs. Participant-centred
explanations that focus only on a pivotal NP are inadequate for explaining the total switch­
reference system in Korafe, which must include apparent anomalies as well. That is
because switch-reference expresses a relationship between clauses, not merely between
NPs. As Stirling ( 1 993 : 1 3 6) suggests, ""SR is a clause level function which does not deal
with the reference of NPs as such but with degrees and types of cohesion between
eventualities"".
   Five types of cohesion that produce ' event integration' (Givon 1 98 3 : 53-54, 1 987: 1 79,
1 990a:827) are: ( 1 ) referential continuity, (2) temporal continuity, (3) location continuity,
(4) action continuity and (5) thematic continuity. Continuity and discontinuity of reference,
temporality, and action play a major role in signalling relationships between clauses in the
Korafe switch-reference system.
  As was previously noted, continuity and discontinuity of syntactic subject referents is
encoded by the canonical switch-reference system.
    Temporal continuity or order is maintained in Korafe SRCs by both sequencing and
simultaneous medial verbs. The order of events in the real world imposes a temporal
' straitjacket' on the sequence of medial verbs encoding them. The use of simultaneous
medial verbs in the canonical system does not interrupt this order. The event signalled by a
simultaneous medial verb must commence before the event encoded by the verb in the
reference clause, so at its onset it preserves temporal iconicity. However, its terminus is
unspecified and overlaps with the subsequent event encoded by the reference clause.
   Like sequencing medial verbs, simultaneous medial verbs may not normally be reversed
without disturbing the temporal sequence. However, simultaneous medial verbs are the
only medial forms that may be freely reversed when they encode total overlap and are
coordinated by a conj unction that is a free form such as a ' and' and 0 ' o r '?O To indicate
total discontinuity or a complete reversaf 1 of temporal order, co-ranking structures with
final verbs must be used.
     Regarding action continuity, Givon ( 1 983 :54) suggests that:
        . . . action continuity is the domain of chaining verbs/predications one after
        another within the thematic paragraph in a way that coheres or makes temporal
        or causal sense.
  He adds, "" . . foreground clauses . . . tend to maintain the sequence of action continuity"".
For Korafe then, the canonical SRC is certainly the domain of foregrounded clauses. It has
been claimed (Labov and Waletzky 1 966: 20-2 1 ) that ""only independent clauses are20
        The ss and os indicators can be viewed as conjunctions, meaning 'and x' , ' while x, 'then x ' where x
        is an event encoded by the medial verb form. However, switch-reference indicators are bound forms;
        the conjunctions mentioned here are free forms, having a demonstrative base.
21
        Within the switch-reference system, it is possible to use a negative deverbal together with a medial
        form of iri 'remain ' followed by a temporal PP. This structure has the format: 'x remained not having
        happened. before that '. Technically, however, the correct temporal ordering is still preserved in this
        structure.
                                                                         Apparent anomalies in SRCs       243relevant to temporal sequences"" of narrative units. 22 However, there is a definite
resemblance between SRCs and the strings of independent narrative in clauses of English
(that Labov and Waletzky discussed). Like strings of narrative clauses in English, SRCS are
the major vehicle in Korafe for narration of events in temporal sequence, even though they
are primarily comprised of medial dependent clauses. The marking on medial verbs is
equivalent to English conjunctions 'and then' or 'and while'. In fact, the primary function
of the SRC is to indicate and maintain action continuity within narrative and procedural
discourses. Final independent verbs are used to interrupt action continuity, so there is the
potential for discontinuity of action or backgrounding at each occurrence of a final verb.
   Apparent anomalies signal an abrupt break between the marking and the reference
clauses. Whenever apparent anomalies occur, the marking clause registers continuity of
reference, temporal order, and/or continuity of action. However, the subsequent reference
clause indicates discontinuity. The event signalled by this clause does not have the same
subject referent, is out of temporal order with the previous event, and/or is an event off the
action line.
   Although discrepancies in subject referencing between clauses and differences in status
and temporality signal apparent anomalies, they do not provide their raison d 'etre. My
hypothesis is that apparent anomalies occur in the Korafe switch-reference system to
encode discontinuity of action in discourse. Giv6n ( 1 983 :54) links discontinuity of action
with background, stating: ""background clauses . . . tend to be outside the sequence of action
continuity . . . "" Hopper and Thompson ( 1 980:280) defme backgrounding as:
     That part of a discourse which does not immediately and crucially contribute to
     the speaker's goal, but which merely assists, amplifies, or comments on it, is
     referred to as BACKGROUND.
To explain how apparent anomalies function in Korafe, it is helpful to distinguish two basic
types of background: 'off-line background' and 'on-line background,?3
22    Interpreting Labov, Waletzky and Reinhart, Thompson ( 1 987:442) states: ""According to Labov and
      Waletzky and Reinhart, the foreground (narratives) clauses must not be syntactically dependent"". That
      would exclude Korafe medial verb clauses from being foregrounded clauses. However, Pawley
      (personal communication) counters: ""I suspect medial verb clauses would qualify as ' independent' in
      Labov' s and Waletsky' s sense. They were concerned to exclude embedded clauses and clauses of
      reason, condition, etc. which broke up the iconic ordering of narrative clauses. True medial clauses are
      'dependent', but they don't break up iconic ordering (usually)"".
          Hopper and Thompson ( 1 984 : 74 1 -742) also express two opposing ideas about chaining
      constructions. They suggest: ""THE 'CHAINING' CONSTRUCTION is a term for a sequence of real is clauses
      in which only the final one is presented as foregrounded"". However, they go on to say: ""not all medial
      v's show less categoriality than their [mal counterparts: in many Papuan languages, medial v's which
      are 'coordinate' with the following v typically do not mark tense and mood independently, but ones
      which are 'subordinate' to the final v do mark these categories. This apparent paradox suggests that
      chained clauses are typically in a part-whole relationship to some higher discourse unit...""
23    Others have also noted that the m ismatched reference clause, termed S 2, can be interpreted as
      background information. Hairnan ( 1 985 : 82-83, 92), drawing on comments from Longacre ( 1 972),
      Marlett ( 1 98 ) ), and Gordon ( 1 983), suggests that it is appropriate to interpret S 2 as backgrounded
      information for Hua. Reesink ( 1 983:235) uses terms like 'setting' and 'reasonable necessary condition
      for them.' Roberts ( 1 988a: 1 1 4) suggests that this segment is ""bracketed off...as background material
      or a subordinate theme"".
         Thelin ( 1 990:25-3 ) ) discusses two types of background: actual background and proper background.
      Actual background has the feature [+TIMEJ or ""temporally definite. (related directly to state-changing
                                                                          ..
244    Chapter 7   ' Off-line background' includes all events that are not temporally ordered within the
time frame for the main event line of the SRC. Korafe embedded constructions, both those
that terminate with a fmal verb and purpose constructions, are ' off-line background' in
discourses.
   ' On-line background' is temporally ordered within the time frame for the main SRC
event line. Unlike 'off-line background' constructions which often can be moved to other
places in the sentence, the order of the mismatched clause encoding 'on-line background'
cannot be reversed with clauses preceding or following it. The mismatched clauses
described in this chapter belong to 'on-line background' . An emotion or physiological
change of state impinges on the main participant, but does not take the focus off him or her.
Apparent anomalies in the system relegate temporal, meteorological or circumstantial
events to settings. In both of these cases, the mismatched clause is temporally synchronised
with the main event line, but the speaker or author has chosen to use apparently anomalous
SS marking to represent the mismatched clause as part of the background that supports the
main event line rather than being a main line event itself. As for the temporal mismatch
type, one would think that the mismatched clause should have a position on the main event
line, since it does focus on a significant discourse entity, explaining the complication that
entity introduces into the discourse. However, this participant or entity is experienced or
seen through the eyes of another major participant that has his or her role in clauses that do
express the main event line. At no time is this temporally mismatched clause given its own
separate temporal status on the main event line.
   Let us return to the analogy of the stage play. Concepts like the 'narrator', 'actors' , the
'spotlight', ' stage sets or backdrops' , and positions such as 'centre-stage' , 'down-stage', in
the 'orchestra pit', 'before the curtains' can all be used to explain how apparent anomalies
operate.
   Embedded sentences that encode 'off-line' background material are like the sections of
the play that the narrator reads either in the orchestra pit, off to one side, or in front of the
curtain.
   Mismatches expressing 'on-line' background are represented as events or states that
actually are played out or have a place on the stage. Those involving physiological or
psychological responses are like those segments that are read by the narrator off to one side
or in the orchestra pit at the same time as the actor standing frontstage and centre stage is
miming them in his or her facial expressions and body gestures.
   Mismatches encoding temporal, meteorological or circumstantial settings are like stage
sets or backdrops on the stage.
   In mismatches involving narrative backtracking to pick up some missing strands of the
story, the participant whose activities are encoded by the main event line is like the actor
who remains in the spotlight at all times. The participant involved in one or more events on
the secondary event line is like an actor who performs his role downstage and out of the      foreground events)"". Proper background with the feature [-T I ME] is 'temporally indefinite' or not
      specifically defmed in tenns of time. Thelin applies these background types to English and Russian,
      but I am unsure how his definitions match with the Korafe background types. Therefore, I am using
      the tenns 'on-line background' and 'off-line background'.
                                                             Apparent anomalies in SRCs   245spotlight, except when the spotlighted actor moves near enough for the spotlight to
encompass both of them.
   In the same way, the thematically prominent NP in bracketing structures corresponds to
the actor frontstage and centre stage with the spotlight on him or her. The subject of the
bracketed clause corresponds to the actor downstage who is only in the spotlight when the
actor being spotlighted moves into proximity with him or her.
   Likewise, partitioning is like narrowing the focus of the spotlight from two actors to the
prominent one in this event.
   The speaker or author is like the playwright who plans the production, the technical
production manager who handles the spotlight, the stage hands who move the stage sets
into place and the narrator who orchestrates all the entrances and exits of the actors. He or
she makes and executes all the staging decisions. In the process, the switch-reference
system gets used in two ways. Morphosyntactically, it sets up formal and semantic relations
between clauses, that enable the speaker to reference events iconically and to keep track of
subject referents. Pragmatically, it provides a way for the speaker to create scenes that
represent the world from his or her perspective, foregrounding significant events that carry
the action forward in a discourse and backgrounding supporting material.

                                    CO-RANKING STRUCTURES   Languages containing chaining structures, particularly those with switch-reference, are
often presented as being rather exotic. However, chaining structures are not the only type
Korafe has. The co-ranking structures, discussed in this chapter, behave similarly to
structures which have several verbs of the same rank predicating each clause in the
sentence in English and other Indo-European languages.
   A co-ranking sentence (CRS) 1 has as its primary constituents two or more bases of the
same rank. 2 Such bases can either be clauses or clause sequences that act as a unit (e.g.
SRCs or other C R SS). They terminate with a final verb, a copula or a predicate in a
topic-{;omment clause without the copula.
  Example S . l is a CRS with two main bases ( 1 and 2), but each of the main bases is
multiclausal. (Note that EC stands for an embedded clause.)
S.1      Ava+sedo,
         that.cT+say.I.SEQ.SS
Base 1   [[na mendeni=kena            kasia=imi         ijug+e-raena] EC-l a=da
           I S some=ALOC              parable=cEFF .TIF teach+do-cUST. 1 S .FN=GEN
      Longacre ( 1 985:238) uses the term 'co-ranking structures' to refer to structures which combine ""verbs
      of the same rank"". These clauses are often joined by conjunctions, e.g. 'and', 'but', 'or' in English.
          Technically, a sentence is minimally a clause plus prosodic features. In the case of written text, the
      prosodic features are represented by punctuation. Combinations of clauses are 'clause complexes'
      (Halliday 1 985 : 1 92-193) until prosodic features are assigned to them. However, as applied to Korafe,
      the term 'co-ranking structures' is used interchangeably with 'co-ranking sentences', and the term
      'sentence' is used for clauses and clause sequences that terminate with an independent final verb.
      Clause sequences that do not terminate with an independent final verb are not sentences.
2     The definition of 'base' as a clause or clause sequence that is a primary constituent of a sentence
      follows Bruce's ( 1 984:26 1 -263) explanation of the term. Adverbial clauses and other clauses that are
      phonologically distinct from the independent base are considered to be sentence bases.
          Longacre ( 1 985:284, 235-237) uses the term 'base' in a much more restricted sense to refer to
      structures which are ""a functional subpart of a nucleus"" of the sentence. He distinguishes sentence
      'margins', which normally contain adverbial clauses, from 'bases' . Thus, for h im, co-ranking
      structures are limited to bases in paratactic relationship with each other. [n this work, bases which
      have terminal verbs of the same rank (Le. fmal verbs) are CRSs. This includes bases in either paratactic
      or hypotactic relationship. Thus, the defmition of CRS used here is much broader than Longacre's.
          Not all clauses or clause sequences are bases in CRSs. Structurally, embedded c lauses and
      sequences of clauses that act as a unit (e.g. SRCS) terminate with fmal verbs, but they function as NPs
      or constituents ofNPs and are phonologically bound to the matrix clause in which they are embedded.
      They are, therefore, not primary constituents (bases) of CRSS.","[261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266]"

4.4.2 PERCEPTION AND FEELING PREDICATIONS
   Perceptions are expressed by a small group of two-place predicates which occur with
either agent or experiencer semantic roles as subject and object-theme as object. Verbs
predicating perception clauses include: gi ' see, look at' , ningi ' hear, listen to, obey ' ,
kasame e 'know, learn' , bune 'not know' , itatame ' feel, touch' , tambu ' meet up with, look
for', kote 'think', tumonde 'believe, trust' , dubo bu ' love ' , uju e ' want', oju e ' fear, be
afraid of . In example 4.53, the syntactic subject is an agent [+volition, +control] overtly
present as an NP in the initial clause and co-referenced on the verb of perception, gosudo
(aira) 'he went along looking at' .
4.53   ... kora=da   ata+kotu aminda              gosu-do       a-ira
           beach=LOC foot+print that.TIF.CEFF.LOC see.II-SEQ.SS go.NDUR-TP.3S.FN
       noaro=kena          buvu-do . . .
       3S.wife=ALOC arrive. I-SEQ.SS
       ' . . . he went along the beach looking at the footprints and approached his wife . . .      '
The subject of example 4.54 is an experiencer [-control, -volition], one who merely
receives the information.
4.54   Na binD ningi-do          dudukughe-do            ghamo keinghu-sira.
       I S news hear.I-SEQ.SS be.surprised.l-sEQ.SS lungs         constrict.I-DP.3S.FN
       'I heard the news and was surprised and was startled out of my wits. '
   The object of perception verbs is sometimes a sentential complement. The complement
is underlined in example 4.55. As the comma indicates, the pause between the two bases in
                                             ,
this sentence follows ava 'that (contrastive) .
4.55   . . . ghaka reda     dotutu-sena         ava,    na jo

       kasama+ae =ri.
       knowledge+not.do=CoP .AQ
       ' . . .1 didn't know where I left the canoe. '
   With the verbal lexeme oju e 'fear, be afraid o f and occasionally with uju e 'want', the
object is marked by the benefactive-purpose postposition dae 'on account of .
4.56   Namane evetu+genembo vuvuji=dae                     oju+e-raera.

       ' We people are afraid of centipedes.'
1 26     Chapter 4Purpose and negative purpose or apprehension constructions marked by the complementiser
dae ' on account of are often sentential complements of uju e 'want' and oju e ' fear'
respectively. These constructions are more fully discussed in §7.2.2.

4.4.3 IMPERSONAL EXPERiENTIAL PREDICATIONS
   Korafe has a set of impersonal experiential predications that encode involuntary
physiological and emotional responses. 'Impersonal constructions' are so-called because
any entity that could be construed as controlling or motivating the response is non­
volitional and non-personal. These impersonal predications have the following
characteristics:
( 1 ) up to three entities may be indicated by overt NPs. They are: (a) an animate entity,
      usually human, who experiences the affecting stimulus and responds, (b) the body part
      affected, and (c) the emotion or bodily response. 7
(2) the animate entity making the response is not cross-referenced on the verb as subject,
    and is not in control of its response. Its syntactic status is discussed in detail below.
(3) the verbal predicate invariably cross-references a third person singular subject,
    regardless of the person and number of the overt NPs.
   Physiological responses have three common components: ( 1 ) an animate entity (often
represented by a personal pronoun), (2) an optional body part (represented by an NP such as
jiro 'head') and (3) a body response which has a verbal component (i.e. merna resira ' it is
hurting (lit. it is saying pain)').
        physiological response: (1) animate entity (2) (body part) (3) body response+V
    Emotional responses have two basic components: ( 1 ) an animate entity and (2) an
emotion usually expressed in a nominal+verb combination (i.e. dubo merna erira 'he or she
is sad (lit. he or she/it is doing neck pain)').
        emotional response: ( 1 ) animate entity (2) emotion+V
   Examples 4.58, 4.59, and 4.60 typify physiological responses. In each of these cases, a
human entity (na ' I ' or namane 'we') is the initial element labelled ( 1 ) in the predication.
The second element labelled (2) is the body part involved : jiro 'head' or ala ' leg' . The third
element labelled (3) is the bodily response.
4.58      ( 1 ) Na           (2) jiro         (3) sarig-er-ira.
                IS                 head             split- IPF PRES.3S. FN
                                                             -                ' I have a splitting headache. (lit. lime head is splitting)'7      Korafe does not mark the body part or the emotion as inalienably possessed, as some languages do.
       Roberts ( l 988a: 1 00) documents both for Amele, a Papuan language from the Madang Province.
                                                     Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences    1 27   Example 4 . 5 8 has two overt N P arguments na ' 1 ' and jiro ' head', the response is
registered by the verb sarigerira ' it is splitting' . Example 4.59a has the same two overt
arguments as 4.58, but a verbal lexeme (nominal + verb: mema resira ' it hurts (lit. says
pain)') indicates the bodily response.
4.59a. ( 1 ) Na        (2) jiro           (3) mema+re-s-ira.
             IS               head              pain+IPF-say-PRES.3S.FN
       'I have a headache. (lit. lime head is saying pain.)'
It is possible to use a possessive pronoun with some body parts in a sentence like 4.59a.
The word ungo 'armlhand' shown in 4.59b illustrates this.
4.59b. ( 1 ) Nanda      (2) ungo       (3) mema+re-s-ira.
             IS.GEN          arm           pain+IPF-say-PRES.3S.FN
       ' My arm is hurting (lit. saying pain).'
In some cases, there is no body part included, just the bodily response, ighoi etiri ' it did
hunger' or 'hunger did' in (4.60).
4.60   . . . vare+begata=da semb+i-se,
             garden+path=Loc cross.l+go.DUR-SIM.SS
       ( 1 ) namane        (3) ighoi+e-tiri...
                l .PL.EXC       hunger+dO. I-SEQ.R.3S.DS
       ' . . . as (we) were crossing on the garden path, we got hungry and. . . '
   Predications indicating emotional responses pattern like example 4.6 1 have two basic
elements: ( 1 ) the animate entity and (3) the emotion.
4.6 1 a. ( 1 ) Na   (3) dubo+mema+er-ira.
               IS       neck+pain+IPF-do.PRES.3S.FN
         'I am overcome with grief. '
Unlike the physiological examples given above, the body part and the bodily response are
not separate entities.8 Instead, they form a compound nominal unit in Korafe, i .e. dubo
mema 'worry, grief, problem (lit. neck pain) ' . Example 4.61 b is ungrammatical.
4.61b. *(1 ) Nanda dubo mema                er-ira.
             I S.GEN neck pain              IPF-do.PRES.3S.FN
       'I am overcome with grief. '
8   There are contexts where it is acceptable to encode physiological responses by an animate entity
    possessing the body part. For example, Najiro mema resira 'I have a headache' can be changed to:
        Nanda jiro mema re-s-ira,                        nanange atimb-aoni?
        I S.GEN head pain          IPF-say-PRES.3S.FN do.how.! carry.slung.on.head-H. I S.AQ
        'My head is aching, how ever will I carry that stringbag slung on my head?'
    Most Korafe lexemes conveying emotions are metaphors composed of a body part (e.g. dubo 'neck') that
    co-lexicalises with a qualifier or a body response. After combination, these lexemes are inseparable. Na
    dubo mema erira ' I am sad (lit. lime neck pain it is doing)' cannot be changed to *Nanda dubo mema
    erira ' my neck is doing pain', nor is it possible to insert a negative focus marker, *Nanda dubo jQ mema
    aeri. But dubo mema 'worry, sadness' can be used as a nominal compound:
        Nanda dubo+mema=mo evi=ri.
        I S.GEN neck+pain=T1F          this.CT=COP.AG
        ' My problem, (well, it) is this.'
1 28     Chapter 4This nominal compound can either be regarded as a complement incorporated into the stem
of a verbal lexeme (nominal + verb) or a separate NP argument if expanded into a full NP
with modifiers, e.g. dubo merna feria beM ' very great grief .
   It should be noted that the animate entity experiencing the emotion is sometimes cross­
referenced as the verb.
4.62      ( 1 ) Na (3) dubo+mema+er-ena.
                IS      neck+pain+IPF-do.PRES. I S.FN
          'J am upset over this(lit. I am doing neck pain). ' (And I ' m going to stay that way.)The semantic difference between examples 4 . 6 1 a and 4.62 is one of control . The
impersonal rendering in 4.6 1 a registers an involuntary emotion, something that over­
whelms the animate experiencer. In example 4.62, the animate entity controls the emotion,
choosing to nurse it over a period of time or even to generate it in his mind.
   The syntactic function of the animate entity experiencing the bodily process or emotion
cannot be conclusively established in Korafe. It could quite possibly have object function,
because it is an unmarked non-subject argument.9 If that were the case, the clause in the
impersonal experiential construction would have OSV as its normal order. It should be noted
that unlike other clauses manifesting O S V order, in this construction, the putative S
constituent is never marked with the effector of change marker imi.
   In fact, there are no clear grammatical criteria for identifying the subj ect of the
impersonal experiential construction, beyond the third person singular subject agreement
marker on the verb. There are at least three posssibilities regarding the identification of a
subject. 10
( 1 ) The body part affected or the bodily response NP when they are not incorporated in the
      verb are the subject.
(2) Some unspecified (in most cases) stimulus triggering the response is the subject.
(3) There is no subject. If this solution is adopted, it could apply globally to all cases.
  Assigning semantic roles to arguments in these predications is also problematic. The
most plausible role designation for the animate entity is experiencer, and for the body part9      In those Papuan languages that do mark the verb for object agreement, it is clear that the animate entity
       is cross-referenced as the object. (See Roberts 1 988a:97, Reesink 1 983 :232-233, and Olson 1 98 1 :296-
       298.)
10
       Stirling ( 1 993 :242-243) gives a fourth explanation for impersonal constructions in Amele, involving a
       'dummy subject'. Rejecting Roberts' (forthcoming:77) solution that ""incorporated nominals"" encoding
       emotions are co-referenced as subject, she ( 1 993 :242-243) cites the occurrence of the 'pseudo-passive'
       in Amele as support for setting up a third person singular ' dummy subject'.
            However, one cannot claim precedence for a dummy subject from the pseudo-passive set in Korafe,
       because Korafe uses a third person plural, not singular, form for the pseudo-passive, as jitoro 'they put'
       below shows .
         ... 'telephone exchange ' nanange-do         jit-oro             Popondetta ghe-do

                                                      Clauses. predicates. predications and sentences      1 29is patient. However, when such a designation is made, it turns out that a patient argument
rather than an experiencer has subject function in impersonal predications encoding
physiological responses. This reverses the subject-accessibility hierarchy, referred to in
§3.2.2 . 1 , in which experiencer is selected as subject before patient. The fact is, though, that
the animate entity never has subject function in impersonal predications. It does, however,
have the genitive circumstantial role in some predications expressing physiological
responses (see example 4.59b).
   The question before us is what the third person subject marking on the verb is agreeing
with. Let us briefly consider each of the syntactic alternatives along with some semantic
alternatives.
   1 . In physiological responses, the most likely candidate for syntactic subject is the body
part experiencing the response. In examples 4.58 and 4.59a, this NP is a body part, jiro
'head', and in 4.59b ungo ' hand ' . It agrees in person with the third person subject
agreement marking on the verb. However, as plural marking never occurs in such
constructions this fact is not diagnostic. In terms of the semantic relations between
constituents, this body part NP encodes the most likely entity experiencing the response. I I
   Physiological or emotional responses (e.g. ighoi etiri 'got hungry' in example 4.60 and
dubo merna erira 'felt grief) can be considered to be incorporated into the verb. However,
when the nominal is modified as in ighoi ambarako etiri 'got extremely hungry' and dubo
merna teria bekQ erira ' is totally overwhelmed by grief , it is certainly a third person
singular form with which the verb could agree.
   2. Viewing an unspecified external stimulus as the subject would scarcely be feasible if
there were no cases where a stimulus is specified. However, in example 4.63, a stimulus is
specified. The flounder's biting the narrator is the external stimulus provoking the vexation
Cedric Moghara reported in the story from which 4.63 is taken.
4.63a. [Gamb-iri. l sTI MULUS      [dubo+eko+e-tiri] RESPONSE gi-do.        kaiya

        ' (The flounder) bit (me), and it greatly upset (me), and I got a knife, poked,
        slashed, and generally severed the (mesh connections of my) fish net.'
In this case the stimulus would be treated similarly to the way the initial event in clause
sequences encoding completive aspect is treated. In example 4.63b the subject of dadabetiri
'it finished' is the event,furu dighero 'they lashed the fence'.
4.63b . . ..furu digh-ero                dadabe-tiri . . .
             fence tie.!-SEQ.R.3PL.DS finish.l-SEQ.R.3S.DS
        they lashed the fence            and it finished
        ' . . . they finished lashing (together) the fence . . . '
II
     Roberts ( 1 988a: 1 00) treats body parts as subjects in Amele impersonal experiential constructions where
     they occur.
1 30      Chapter 4   In the same way , it is possible that the subject of dubo eko etiri '(I) got angry (lit. it did
anger)' is the event gambiri ' it bit (me)' .
   I f this option were chosen, 1 2 one could posit the fol lowing two revised sets o f
participatory arguments for impersonal experiential predications. This solution would allow
the physiological response to be an object, either incorporated in the verb or a separate
constituent from the verb, having the same syntactic role in the cases illustrated in
examples 4.6 1 a and 4.62. 1 3 Physiological response predications would have the following
semantic roles : locus, patient and/or force , and object-theme (where the nominal is a
separate N P ). Emotional response predications would have these arguments: experiencer,
force, and object-theme (where the nominal is a separate N P).
   3 . If the final option were adopted, it could apply globally to all cases, including the
ones where only an animate entity and a nominal+verb combination exist, e.g. 4.60 and
4.6 1 a, in which there is no NP overtly present in the clause that would trigger subject
agreement. However, this option is controversial. Subject is considered by many to be an
indispensable element in a complete sentence. 14
   To sum up, the evidence is divided. Where a body part is present in physiological
responses, it is a reasonable candidate for subject. Option (2) is attractive , but there are too
few instances where a stimulus is specified to provide conclusive evidence.
    These impersonal experiential predications are somewhat unusual in that subject and
topic are maintained as distinct entities. The animate entity is the topic constituent in this
construction, corresponding to P I in the formula P I SOY (Dik 1 978 :20-2 1 ) . Since it never
has subject function, this animate entity cannot be realised by the focal actor pronoun, as
illustrated in 4.64a. Example 4.64b likewise demonstrates that it cannot be emphasised by
t% 'self which marks an actor taking credit for an accomplishment.
4.64a. *Nane       ighoi+er-ira.

Since the animate entity has topic function , it obligatorily precedes the negative focus

THEME constituents are occasionally marked by ava. In example 3 . 1 2 1 from an animal
book, the author marks the thematic NP with ava to introduce it as a new topic that contrasts
with other topics in the book.

  As indicated in the discussion of circumstantial semantic roles i n § 3 .2.2.2, the
postposition { imi} 29 'effector of change' marks NPs with INSTRUMENT and MEANS roles. It
29     The Korafe effector of change marker { imi} has two forms: i and imi. Both i and imi follow NPs
       cliticising to the terminus of the NP they are relating to the predicate or a larger discourse chunk; their
       usage in this context is not clearly differentiated in the corpus of Korafe data available to us. However,
       in combination with a demonstrative root (e , a , 0), i precedes the postpositions: ghae and de
       (comitative dual and plural): ainghae/ainde 'with that one'l'with those' , da (possession): ainda 'of
       that one', dae (purpose, fmal/intended goal-recipient, applicative): aindae 'on account of that', and
       kena 'toward that (end), regarding that'. Postpositions do not follow imi. But the segment mi does
                                                                                           Noun phrases      1 03also marks subject NPs in OSY-ordered clauses. These NPs have pragmatic FOCUS function
and usually play AGENT or FORCE semantic roles. When fuka 'the pig' occurs as subject
and AGENT in example 3 . 1 23a with SOY order, it is not marked, but it must be marked when
the order is OSY, as in 3 . 1 23b.
3 . 1 23 a. Fuka namane=da         vare     sosighi+u-sira.
            pig     I PL.EXC=GEN garden plunder+do. II-DS.3S.FN
            ' Pigs demolished our garden. '
3 . 1 23b. Namane=da       vare    fuka=il*fuka sosighi+u-sira.
           I PL.EXC=GEN garden pig=CEFF         plunder+do. II-DS.3S.FN
           'Our garden, the pigs demolished. '
In example 3 . 1 24, a FORCE is the imi-marked subject.
3 . 1 24      A     agari nu eva=imi                 fat-iri . . .
              and rat        3S sea.waves=CEFF.TIF press/cover. I-sEQ.R.3S.DS
              ' And the rat, him the sea waves overwhelmed . . . '
The { imi} can also mark subjects in SOY-ordered clauses. In example 3 . 1 25 , both subject
and obj ect are marked for pragmatic function. In the context, both referents have been
textually evoked, but the speaker focuses on both referents as the entities initiating the

The {imi} marker might be construed to mark NPs as having the ergative 30 case, if we just
examined the previous examples in which it marks subjects in transitive clauses. However,           cliticise to demonstratives and then is followed by the postpositions da (locative): aminda 'there' and
           go (comparative): amingo ' like that one'.
               All the other documented languages in the Binandere family register a subject marker mi and the
           demonstrative ami or meni and also a pronominal actor marker, marked by -na in Suena, Orokaiva and
           Baruga, -nemi/-nei in Ewage-Notu, and -ne in Korafe. They also have markers of objects and
           sentences very close to the Korafe ava (e.g. awa [Suena,Binandere], awo [Orokaiva], awa and awawa
           [Ewage-Notu], agha [Baruga]. For more details, see Wilson ( 1 994:79-84) for Suena, Capell ( 1 969b:4),
           Larsen and Larsen ( 1 982:78,80) for Orokaiva, Parrington ( 1 978?:37,57-58) for Ewage-Notu, and Farr
           and Farr field notes for Baruga.
30         Ergativity, as defined by Dixon ( 1 979: 59-62) is a syntactically based marking system in which
           morphological case marking and/or syntactic constraints distinguish the A syntactic relation from the S
           and 0 syntactic relations which are treated alike. Ergativity documented in Papuan languages is
           usually realised by case marking on the A syntactic relation. Researchers commonly report
           nominative/accusative syntax with constraints that reflect an A/S pivot. Li and Lang ( 1 979:3 2 1 )
           suggest that ""ergativity i s restricted t o case markings w ithout any syntactic o r discourse
           consequences"", but add that a correlation does exist between the ""use of the ergative marker on the
           subject of a complex sentence and the requirement of an agent by the subordinate verb"".
               From his survey of 35 Papuan languages, Whitehead ( 1 9 8 1 : 50-5 1 ) concluded that case marking
           utilised on the agent or actor does not consistently manifest canonical ergativity. He notes that
1 04    Chapter 3it also marks NPs that are subjects in intransitive clauses and objects in transitive clauses. In
example 3 . 1 26 repeated from 3 . 1 1 0c, the i-marked NP is the subject of an intransitive clause
which has as its predicate the verb ambu 'die' .
3 . 1 26 0    genembo=t ambu-raira       a=mo,    evetu a=in=dae      rori
         or   man=CEFF die. I-CUST.3S.FN that=T/F woman that=CEFF=BEN widow
        se-raera.
        say. I -CU ST. I PL.FN
        'Or when a man dies, we say 'widow' about (his) wife.' (A man ' s death causes
        his wife to become a widow.)
Like the NPs marked with { imi} in preceding examples, genemboi 'the man' is an effector
of change. Although his demise is non-volitional, he does initiate the cycle of events that
turns his wife into a widow. Likewise in example 3 . 1 27, although the { imi} marks an NP in
a clause where it has syntactic object function, it plays the INSTRUMENT role for the events
encoded in the subsequent clause.
3 . 1 27 .. . Ii ghamana a-imi              bu-do        je     bas-ari            amb-ari. . .

         ' . . . and (he) gets that rock and hacks (the wallaby), and it dies ...       '
    Contrastive focus is also indicated by {imi} . In example 3 . 1 28, the force, the sun (iji=i)
is contrasted with the drying rack faro and selected as the proper drying agent. The sun iji is
obligatorily marked by the effector of change marker in this context. 3 1

        smoke.rack+do. H.2PL.CR
         ' Let the sun dry the sea cucumbers; don't smoke (them) ! '
       languages surveyed have the following conditioning factors for marking Agents and Actors: ( I )
       displacement from initial position, (2) introduction of new participants, (3) emphasis of one group of
       participants over or to the exclusion of another, and (4) the identification of the controlling identities at
       the various stages of discourse.
31     Arguments encoding FORCE do not require marking when the effect of the FORCE is a natural
       consequence of its existence and in cases where neither its control in the situation nor the exclusion of
       other possible forces is focused on. Anderson and Wade ( 1 988:9, 1 4) note that the ergative marker in
       Folopa (Southern Highlands Province Papuan language) is not required to mark NPs referencing
       entities that are performing routine social activities ""in which control is de-emphasized"". Therefore, in
       the following Korafe example where the natural process of cut grass and bush drying in the sun is
       described, iji 'the sun' is not marked with -i 'EFFECTOR OF CHANGE' and does not function as the
       syntactic subject with FORCE semantic role. Instead, it is an adjunct, form ing a nom inal+verb
       combination with avare (see §2.6).
           Enda       ghojaba+e-do           je-vu,             fas-e-do         iji/*iji-i      av-are!
           ground machete+do.l-SEQ.SS ChOp.I-2PL.lMP lie-do.l-SEQ.SS sunl*sun-CEFF dry-H.3S.CR
           ' Hack the bush with a machete and chop (it) down, so that it may lie and be sun-dried' .
       Indeed, in this example, verbal morphology prohibits the use of ijii 'the sun, EFFECTOR OF CHANGE' as
       subject with FORCE role. The verb fasedo ' lie down' is marked to indicate that the next verb has the
       same subject, and it has, as its understood subject, enda 'the ground (bush)' . Therefore, the subsequent
       verb avare 'that it may dry' is required to have enda as its understood subject; ijii cannot function as
       its subject.
                                                                            Noun phrases     1 05In example 3 . 1 29, ei 'this contrastive actor' exclusively specifies namonde ' we (INC)' as
the only entity performing the event.
3 . 1 29 Ghasemo    e =mako,     namonde        e =i      vos-oro

       ' Regarding this canoe, just we here can board (it), and it has capacity to hold us
       (lit. we here as opposed to all others will descend, and it will be sufficient).'
The { imi} does not often mark NPs with left-dislocated THEME function. But when it does,
exhaustive contrast is regularly encoded. Most { imi} -marked THEMEs are relative clauses
that play a semantic AGENT, FORCE or INSTRUMENTAL role in the matrix clause, but do not
have syntactic realisation in the matrix clause. In example 3 . 1 3 0, the relative clause is
headless and bears a semantic AGENT relationship with the matrix clause.
3 . 1 30 Ghaka=da a-era              a=lml,        isasambu

       put. in. RED+do. FOC-TP .3PL.AQ
       ' Those ones that went on the canoe, they made all (of the goals in the soccer
       match, each making one).'
The instrument functions as the TOP I C and is positioned initially in example 3 . 1 3 1 to
contrast it with all other knives as well as indicating its control in the event that transpired.
3 . 1 3 1 Vikoko e =imi            Janicewide jingabu gafu+ge-tira.
          knife      this=CEFF.T/F lanicewide snake cut.n+do.FOC-TP.3S.FN
          ' This is the knife with which lanicewide cut the snake in two.'
The postposition { imi} marks TOPIC and FOCUS functions in verbal clauses only, not in
non-verbal topic-comment clauses, as example 3 . 1 32 shows.
3 . 1 32 Genembo fuka mindafu garu=sira          a=mo/*a=imi,
         man     pig big      spear.r I=DP.3S.FN that=T/F/*that=CEFF.T/F
       genembo eveva=ri.
       man       good=COP.AQ
       ' That man that shot a big pig, (he) is a good man. '
According to the Korafe explaining this restriction, the presence of { imi} focuses their
attention on the event performed. Verbs are not predicates of topic-comment clauses;
therefore, {imi} cannot mark NPs in them. However, { im i } can mark the subject of the
existential stative verb iri 'remain', as example 3 . 1 3 3 illustrates.
3 . 1 3 3 Bijo+gharube   a=in=da       joka=da,   ade=jamena      a=imi

       ' Inside that Gharube banana tree, those girls were remaining.'
1 06    Chapter 3Although both mo and {ava} mark postpositional phrases indicating semantic case roles as
THEMEs, {imi} marks NPs only.
   The pragmatic information marker mo introduces entities and re-invokes them as non­
contrastive THEMEs and TOPICs, but {imi} and { va} mark entities that specify contrast and
often have FOCUS function. The {imi} marks the initiator of the event (AGENT), and {va}
the one affected or relocated in the course of the event (PATIENT/EXPERIENCER). Although
both marked NPs in 3 . 1 34 have subject function in intransitive clauses, the i-marked
referent in 3 . 1 34a is a bird with magical powers that it volitionally uses to help people catch
fish. However, in 3 . 1 34b, the spirit of the dead man is marked with ava 'that affected one',
because he is the patient in a prior event: his family have farewelled him properly.
Therefore, he is obligated to come back and use his magical powers to assist his relatives in
fishing and hunting.

          around, that spirit comes and gives good luck. '
In the following two examples, i marks an NP performing an ongoing activity. The ava
marks the same NP when the focus in the verb is on the end of the event and the N P is
viewed less actively.

           ' Those weeds have j ust about covered the whole area.'
  The demonstrative ailaimi combination has an additional use as a marker of rhetorical
questions. It marks the interrogative verb nangetira 'how did it happen?' in example 3 . 1 36.

   The marker { imi} is not limited to marking NPs that function as subjects within transitive
clauses, as is an ergative case marker (Dixon 1 994: 1 0- 1 1 ). Nor does { imi} mark only NPs
with the semantic roles of AGENT, FORCE, and/or INSTRUMENT. Beyond its intraclausal use
as a marker of syntactic and semantic role functions, it marks N Ps that extend their
controlling influence across several clauses in many cases. Korafe data indicates that any
entity that is in some way an initiator or effector of change or the starting point for
communicating contrastive information about an effector of change can host { imi} .
Therefore, a comprehensive view of it as a mixed pragmatic and semantic role marker
signalling the contrastive EFFECTOR OF C HANGE seems warranted. Unlike ordinary
semantic role markers that operate intraclausally, it marks semantic role at the discourse
level interclausally.","[122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127]"

      Reesink ( 1 987: 1 82- 1 88) discusses gapping i n Usan, also a Papuan language. Characterised by an SOY

The parallel clauses refer to the egrets by the modifier set eini . . . eini 'the one . . . the other' .
The location on the log where each of the egrets bite is mentioned as mendo sovenida 'at

gambudo 'bite' is gapped in the initial clause.

   The NPs manifesting subject and object in the first clause are usually more complex than
those manifesting the same constituents in the second clause. In example 6.47, the subject
of the first clause is the pronominal copy ne 'they' of the theme gegenembo etoto 'two
men' . The subject of the second clause is j ust the numeric quantifier etoto. The object of
both clauses is muni soveni ' primary dance leader on one side ' . A further indication of the
dual clausal status is the use of the conj unction kotugo ' and likewise', which conjoins
clauses, not NPs .

6.2.6 CONJOINING BETWEEN SRCs BY RECAPITULATION
   The occurrence of a final verb terminating an SRC within a longer discourse signals the
end of a sequence of integrated actions. It often sigrials also a break in iconic ordering. In
order to resume the iconically ordered narrative or procedural explanation of the previous
SRC, the speaker repeats or paraphrases a terminal portion of that SRC. This recapitulation,16     The fJ symbol i n examples in this section replaces the gapped medial verb.
204      Chapter 6often termed 'tail-head linkage' , 1 7 may be accomplished by repeating the same verb that is
the ' tail' in the first sentence as the initial predicate (the ' head') of the second sentence.
This lexical overlapping is illustrated by the underlined verbs ( itira. Itido) at the sentence
juncture in example 6.48.
6.48      ... nunda bayau=ghae             it-ira.         Iti-do . . .
               3S .GEN goOd=COM.DU cook.I-TP.3S .FN cook.I-SEQ.SS
          ' . . . she cooked it with her food. Having cooked it . . . '
Recapitulation is not always limited to repeating the terminal verb in medial form. The
verbs in the svc terminating the initial sentence in example 6.49 are recapitulated by an
SVC that terminates with a dependent final verb.
6.49      ... sumbu         buv-eni.               Sumbu             buv-ena . . .
               run.NDUR arrive.NDuR-TP. I S .AQ run.NDUR arrive.NDUR-TP . I S.FN
          ' . . . running, I arrived. Having run and arrived . . . '
The lexical verb (se ' say' ) in an aspect-encoding clause complex is the repeated segment in
example 6.50; the grammatical aspect-marking verb is not used in the recapitulation.
6.50      ""Aki=mane,       reighi tefo+tafo =ri, ""   se-do        ghe-tira.

          ""'Older sisters, (this) place (has) nobody at all"", she would habitually say. She
          would say (that and) . . . '
The narrator may summarise the event encoded in the 'tail ' using a generic verb in the
'head' . Commonly used generic verbs in Korafe are e 'do' and aminge 'do that way ' .
6. 5 1    ... ungo ata     de-do      jojore-ge-teri.               E-tero

         ' . . . they beat and bent their arms and legs. They did (that), and seeing (that) . . . '
Sometimes an NP is also included in the recapitulating segment. In 6.52 the pronoun nu '3S '
is included in the recapitulating clause .
6.52      .. .fumb-ari=dae              e-do         amb-ira.         Nu ambu-do . . .

7.3.3 MISMATCHES IN TEMPORAL SEQUENCING
   Mismatches in temporal sequencing differ from the two previous types of mismatches in
a number of ways:
( 1 ) They require three clauses as their basic components, nottwo.
(2) The subject referent of the mismatched clause is a central participant in the discourse,
    not just mentioned in the one clause.
(3) They obligatorily encode temporal overlap of the events they represent. The other two
    types usually encode a sequence of events, but they may encode overlap.
The three clausal components of 'temporal mismatches' are: ( 1 ) the initial marking clause
( S I ) predicated by a SS medial verb, (2) the 'mismatched' reference clause (S 2 ) predicated
by a D S medial verb, and (3) the subsequent clause ( S 3 ) predicated by a perception or
feeling predication. 1 5 S I and S 3 must have the same subject referent. The linear structure of
this mismatch can be diagrammed :
       S I ( SUBJECT=i)     SS.SEQ S 2 ( SUBJECT=j)          DS.SIM S 3 ( SUBJECT=i)The mismatched clause ( S 2) may be either transitive or intransitive. A simultaneous medial
form of the verb predicates the mismatched clause. The temporal overlap encoded in this
mismatch is partial or total between marking ( S I ) and reference ( S 2 ) clauses, and total
between S 2 and S 3 . However, S I and S 3 are ordered to represent the iconic order of the
events they encode. 16 S 3 often encodes a perception event.
  Example 7.28 illustrates many features of temporal mismatches. It details the
movements of the narrator ( S 2 ) and several men from the Tevari clan who came ( S I ) and
met the narrator ( S 3 ) with the express purpose of helping the narrator land the dugong he
had caught.

       know', itatame 'feel', tambu 'find' and ningi 'hear' .
16     The S2 in these constructions differs from skipped embedded sentences in that it does not have nominal
       function in the clause that follows it, nor does it serve as a thematic nominal argument for the clauses
       that follow it.
236    Chapter 7       (tafu-seri. 1 3
        find.Il-DP.3PL.AQ
       ' They paddled and went, and while I was coming up on the Tarama (reef),
       they met (me).'
The verb in the marking clause ( S l ) is inflected for a third person plural subject; it also
indicates that the reference clause has the same subject referent. However, the reference
clause (S2) does not have a third person plural subject. Instead, it has an overt subject NP,
the personal pronoun na ' I ' , which it cross-references as subject on the simultaneous medial
verb viviteno 'while I was ascending ' . S2 correctly indicates disjoint subj ect reference
between itself and S 3 . The clauses S3 and S l share the same subject referent (3PL). S 3 has the
perception verb tafuseri 'they found/they met'.
   In the two mismatch types discussed in §7. 3 . 1 and §7.3 .2, the subject referent does not
persist as a subject or a topic past the mismatched reference clause in which it occurs.
However, in temporal mismatches, the subject is often a prominent participant in the
discourse. In the example above, the speaker, who plays a significant role throughout the
discourse text, is the referent of the subject in the mismatched reference clause. In example
7.29 also, a prominent participant is the referent of the mismatched clause.

       ' But one day, in the morning those women said that they would dip up water,
       they went, their younger sister was drinking water, and her older sisters saw
       (her drinking water) ... '
In 7.29 the subject of S2, the younger sister, differs from the subject of S J , those women,
even though this referential shift is not indicated by the subj ect cross-referencing the verb
in the marking clause displays. This younger sister persists as a topic well beyond the limits
of this clause. In fact, she plays a prominent role in the discourse. Her prominent status is
syntactically indicated by the demonstrative+effector-of-change marker, aimi 'that
controlling participant' , which modifies the noun, gagarako ' little sister' that references
her. This marker express both her topical and agentive roles.
   The text of spoken and written discourse is, by definition, linear, with clauses following
each other. The ordering of clauses in chaining structures is intended to represent the iconic
order of the events described, or at least the speaker' s view of the order. The use of
simultaneous medial verb forms allows for overlap slippage, but in most cases in Korafe,
the onset of the event expressed by the initial verb in a sequence occurs at least slightly
before the onset of the event expressed by the the subsequent verb it overlaps with. In
temporal mismatches, the referential discrepancy between S 1 and S2 highlights the break in
                                                                          Apparent anomalies in SRCs   237
iconic ordering that they represent. Unlike most of the examples of the other mismatched
types of S2 clauses discussed above, S2 does not temporally intervene between the event
encoded in S I and the event encoded in S3. Instead, S2 overlaps with these events. Like the
' Western' movies, the linear order with its mismatch between S I and S2 suggests a
'meanwhile back at the ranch house' switch from S I to S2. S I is part of one event line, and S2
brings in a second event line. 1 7 The real character that this mismatch in temporal
sequencing exhibits is better shown by the following schema, in which ' ... ' signals that the
onset of the event or state S2 encodes occurs at an uncertain time and ' ( . . . )' that the event or
state that S2 encodes may persist for an indefinite period.
Main event line:
     S I (SUBJECr=i) SS.SEQ S3 (SUBJECT =i)Subsidiary event line:
     . .. S2 (SUB JECT =J) DS.SI M ( ··· )The nature of S2'S overlap with SI is not clearly specified. In 7.28 and 7.29, the onset of the
state or event expressed by the verb in S2 overlaps at least partially with that of s l . In 7.30a
and b, it is almost certain that the state described by S2, namely the axe' s permanency as a
household tool, which is already the case before the author of this text even turned around
(jovereghedo) and remains so right up through the time of his searching for it (tava useni),
i.e. S2 completely overlaps with SI and S3.

        'I went, and the axe was (there) as, I was looking for it again. '
Both event lines have as subject referents separate and significant entities in terms of the
discourse. SI and S 3 detail the narrator' s activities. Although the subject of S2 is an
inanimate object, oto '(stone) axe', it still plays a significant role in the text, which explains
how the narrator learned the traditional word, oto, for 'axe', when he had previously known
only the word in modern currency: karivaku '(steel) axe'.
   This temporal mismatch schema can be explained in terms of the staging of scenes in a
play. While the action encoded by S I is staged in the spotlight, that expressed by S2 i s
performed in the background shadows. At the point where the subject of S I moves on to17    Roberts ( 1 988a: 1 03) uses the tenn 'subtopicalised clauses' for these m ismatched clauses.
238      Chapter 7perform S 3 , the subject of S I has moved so close to the subject of S2 (or vice versa) that the
spotlight encompasses both of them and continues that way for the duration of S 3 .
   Because the subject(s) of SI and S2 always differ, both are usually represented in their
clauses by overt NPs. When the two separate event lines with two separate subjects overlap,
the identity of the subject-topic of S 3 is often overtly restated to avoid confusion of
referents. The repetition of the same N P, which often is just a pronoun, yields a highly
marked SRC for Korafe because pro-drop is the norm. The repeated use of NPs highlights
the mismatch between the linear nature of spoken and written discourse and the three­
dimensional world of real-life activities.
The temporal mismatch pattern is so useful for looping back in a discourse to pick up
another strand of the story that it is used often, sometimes with deviations. The linear
pattern for mismatches in temporal sequencing is repeated here for quick reference.
        S I (SU BJECT=i)   SS.SEQ S2 (SUBJECT =j) DS.SIM S 3 (SUBJECT = i)In example 7.3 1 , S I terminates with a simultaneous (rather than sequencing) SS medial verb,
and S2 with a sequencing (rather than simultaneous) DS medial verb. Thus, no overlap is
expressed between S 2 and S3 .
7.3 1    [Deinghu-se, l l   [isia bekil      earih                [gi-do, lJ. . .
          travel.Il-� taro real.part do. SEQ.CUST.3S.DS see.l-SEQ.SS
         ' While he is on his walk, he sees that the taro has become ripe... '
This example comes from a procedural account of getting ready for an exchange partner
feast. The taro is already mentioned as ripe in the sentence before this one. So the process
in S 2 has already begun to happen before the event encoded by deinghuse ' while he was on
          ,
his walk (S I) and is already completed before the event encoded by gido 'he saw'. Since the
taro has become ripe before the chief views it, the sequencing form eari must occur; the
simultaneous form urureari cannot.
    In example 7.32 taken from a recorded personal story, Norris Beghuma Mota modifies
this mismatch pattern and highlights it with long pauses, indicated by ' . . . ', to backtrack
temporally in order to bring in a second set of participants, who commenced their fishing
trip before the first set of participants had finished their trip to the garden.

        up and entered the landingh- .. and [Cindi, Cindi was glad1 3 and went down (to
        meet them).'
In this case, more than three clauses are involved. The second group of participants perform
four actions, not one-vosaera 'they went down' , bambudo 'they caught (fish)"" viti
ojighera ' they came up' , and teretero 'they entered' . These actions correspond to the
mismatched constituent, S 2 . However, the final verb teretero 'they entered and' is a DS
sequencing, not simultaneous, medial verb. The verb in S 3 is not a perception verb either.
And only one of the two people who are subjects of S I is the subject of S 3 , Cindi. The DS
sequencing medial verb teretero 'they entered and' is used instead of the simultaneous form
here, because Cindi ' s first action ivuga edo ' she rejoices'-is not concomitant with, but
                                       -rather follows the men's arrival.
   The following example illustrates another deviation from the default temporal mismatch
type. 1 8 The subj ect of S 2, the NP nati 'house ', does not have any ongoing role in the
discourse. It only is mentioned in two sentences. The fact that the ' spirit woman' does not
know where ' her husband' s house' is located highlights the illegitimate role that she is
playing, i.e. impersonating the true wife, whom she has 'done away with '.

       with a mismatch, but conveyed the spirit woman's error through conversations with the owners of the
       houses she mistakenly believed were her 'husband' s' and climbed up on to.

In this example, once again, the pronominal subject nu ' she' of S I is repeated in S 3 . This
repetition clearly identifies the subj ect referent of S 3 on the continuing event line at its
juncture with the subsidiary event line.","[255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260]"

                        CLAUSE CHAIN UNITS (TCCUs)   This chapter examines standardised ways of expressing particular types of events and
situations. It takes up the question: How are things said in Korafe?
     In a much-cited passage, Chomsky ( 1 965 :4) stated that a grammar of a language should
be a systematic description of the linguistic competence of native speakers, competence
being ""the speaker-hearer' s knowledge of the language"". Echoing this view, Radford
( 1 988:3, 27) indicates that ""a model of a native speaker's competence"" is ""a grammar that
tells us what we need to know in order to be fluent in a language"", a grammar being ""a
finite system of rules which generate . . . the infinite set of well-formed sentence-structures in
the language"". In the structuralist grammarian's view, the lexicon is part of the grammar,
lexical items being the form-meaning pairs in a language, morphemes and idioms, that are
unpredictable by the rules of grammar. I
   Pawley ( 1 985 :87-90, 1 994 : 7- 1 8, 27) argues that this ' grammar-lexicon model' presents
                                                              2
an ""impoverished account of linguistic competence"". He argues that a proper speaker
should show nativelike standards in: producing grammatical utterances, pronouncing words
and adhering to conventional intonation, stress and rhythm patterns, being able to decode
fluent speech, knowing the idiomatic way of saying things as opposed to ways that are
merely grammatical, distinguishing between standardi sed expressions and ad hoc
descriptions, and saying the right thing at the right time.
   Drawing on the work of Grace ( 1 987), Pawley proposes an alternative view of languages
as ' subject matter codes (or languages)' . A description of a subject-matter language would
    In recent years, the scope of the lexicon generativists propound has been extended from a minimalist list
    to include: ( I ) more grammatical information about individual lexemes and (2) forms that were initially
    derived by rules of morphonology and syntax, e.g. nominalisations. However, it still differs considerably
    from dictionaries that lexicographers make. Pawley ( 1 986: 1 0 1 ) lists a number of morpheme sequences
    that dictionaries like Webster 's have but grammarians would count as literal expressions, formed by
    productive processes, hence not included in their lexicons.
2
    The term 'grammar-lexicon model' is from Grace ( 1 98 1 ).
        In the 1 960s, Pawley sought to do a grammar and lexicon of Kalam, a Papuan language. Feeling
    dissatisfied both with his grammatical description and early drafts of the lexicon, he ( 1 993 : 1 03) makes
    this comment: ""My thesis . . . failed to record some of the most distinctive and quintessential
    characteristics of the language. The analysis did not give the reader much idea of how the Kalam
    actually say the kinds of things that they say. The most productive patterns for reporting events and
    situations, for instance, were not distinguished from those patterns that were grammatical but
    unidiomatic"" .","[308, 309]"
"
The SS object guideline (G-2) :
    In a sequence of clauses predicated by SS medial verbs, an object NP is maintained as the
understood object of all the transitive clauses in the sequence until the next overt object NP
is introduced.
   In the following example, the arada ' lizard' remains the object until it becomes a ' skin'
(anoso), which remains the object of the transitive three of the following four clauses.

       skin off its skin, get it, come and put in in the house . . . '
In example 6.73, the theme ( P2) copied by the pronoun in the following clause is the
referent of the object of tendido ' lashed' and budD 'got' . A new NP, oka ' fish', is introduced
as the obj ect of the next clause gaedo ' speared' .
6.74   Auri emo,      nu tendi-do      bu-do        ya-ma            oka

       'These iron prongs, we would lash securely on (to a pole), and we would take
       it and go and spear fish from time to time.'
    Although the obj ect often persists in its role over a chain of same-subject medial verbs
until another one takes its place, a topic NP can take precedence in the chain. In example
6.75, the NP rika emo ' (regarding) this bird' is marked with a demonstrative and the topic
marker mo and introduced as the initial object in the SS clause chain. Another unmarked NP,
buroro 'feathers' , is the object of tusedo 'pluck'. However, it would be nonsensical to
regard the 'feathers' as also being the object of the verbs oje itido ' butcher and cook', so it
is safe to assume that the speaker intends the topic NP rika emo ' (regarding) this bird' to be
understood as the object.

The S-tO guideline (G-4) :
   The subject NP of a marking clause predicated by an intransitive DS simultaneous medial
verb is interpreted as the object of the reference clause, provided that no overt object N P
occurs i n the reference clause.
    In example 6.76, gembari a dighari nonua 'clothing already woven and prepared rope'
is the subject ofjiri ' it is coming'. It is interpreted as the obj ect of ereo/era 'we are buying' .
6.76    ... 0 oroko sifo     e =mo,   [gemb-ari    a   digh-ari nonua

        , . . . or today in this day and age, clothing already woven and prepared rope is
        coming to stores, and we are buying (them). '
   This S�o shift occurs regularly when the simultaneous D S verb is followed b y a form of
the verb gi ' see' . The writer of the story from which example 6.77 was taken did not know
the Korafe word for ' axe ' : oto . He only knew the loan word from another language:
karivaku. So each time his father sent him back to the house to find the ' oto ' , he saw the
axe but left it, searching frantically for some other item.
6.77   Oto nu ir-iri                           dodo           a-ena,

       ' I saw the oto-axe (there) and left it and went (back) to Dad. (lit. The oto-axe was
       remaining, 1 saw (it) and left (it) and went to Dad.)'
Although an intransitive clause intervenes between the two clauses demonstrating the S�o
shift in example 6.78, it does not affect the shift. The initial clause is marked for a switch of
reference. The first person plural referent marked on the verb in clause 3 is the subject of
both the intransitive verb, yama 'will be going' and the transitive verb jeoro ' we chop ' . The
subject of the initial clause, ambe ' sago tree' , is interpreted to be the object of the third
clause.

       ' The sago tree remains standing, and we go and chop (it), and it falls (down). '
   The S�o shift also occurs with intransitive D S sequencing medial verb forms, when the
clause the DS sequencing form predicates is simultaneously the reference clause in an o�S
shift and the marking clause in an S�o shift (clause 1 : O=i, clause 2: S=i, clause 3 : o=i). In
example 6.79, an o�S shift between clauses 1 and 2 is followed by an S�o shift between
clauses 2 and 3 . These shifts are marked respectively by the DS sequencing medial verbs,
gafaso 'you will cut' and vosari ' it will descend' .

These double shifts occur fairly often in narratives, producing lengthy SRCs. For instance,
example 6.80 has three objects: boguto 'the outer horizontal bearer that supports the house
wall', avaraka ' fire ' , and Mandako Gajaride. The most important referential information to
216    Chapter 6establ ish at the outset is that one person is interacting with all these objects and
participants: Mandako Gajaride ' s wife.

       the fire and it caught on, then she wrenched [down] (her husband) Mandako
       Gajaride and he came down, she threw (him) up on the fire and he burned.'
The initiating agent is not overtly realised by an N P in this SRC, but she i s the wife of
Mandako Gajaride . In these O�S�O shifts, the initiating subject NP is considered as the
most likely candidate for subject of the transitive clauses. The end house-bearer ( boguto) is
initially the object NP of ghonumbetiri ' she wrenched out', but it becomes the subject of
vosetiri ' it went down' after the first switch subject juncture. After the second switch­
subject juncture, it is regarded as the object of saredo 'sawed' , and the wife as the subject
again. The avaraka ' fire' is introduced in the story as the object NP of usetiri 'she kindled'
and becomes the subject of gambiri ' it ignited (lit. it bit) ' . Mandako Gajaride must be
considered the object rather than the subject of ghonumbetiri 'she wrenched out', because it
is the only NP available to be subject of vosetiri 'he went down'. The wife is understood to
be the subject ofJugetiri ' she threw' , and he is understood to be the subj ect of the last two
clauses, vitido avira 'he went up on the pyre and burned to death'.

          APPARENT ANOMALIES IN THE SWITCH-REFERENCE SYSTEM   The hallmarks of Korafe switch-reference constructions (S RCs) are maintenance of
status/tense concord, temporal iconicity and subj ect reference through the medial verb
tracking system. However, departures from temporal ordering and subj ect reference
tracking conventions do occur. These discrepancies are termed ' apparent anomalies ' . The
qualification 'apparent' is employed here because these 'anomalies' can be systematically
explained. Our explanation will be in terms of the resolution of tensions between two
functions of the switch-reference system, namely the marking of syntactic and semantic
relations between clauses and the marking of pragmatic relationships such as
foregroundinglbackgrounding, continuity of topic or salient participant, etc. The former is a
fairly fixed procedure for tracking subject reference and relative tense in a progression of
events. The latter is a more flexible procedure for staging scenes and for creating special
effects within the basic event line.
   Cases of apparently anomalous switch-reference in Korafe are evidenced by: ( 1 )
juxtaposed clauses which demonstrate referential overlap, i.e. they share some of the same
subject referents; (2) embedded constructions which are ' skipped "" over by the switch
referencing and/or the temporal tracking system; and (3) constructions involving medial
verbs that register an apparent mismatch in subject reference between the initial ss-marked
marking clause and the ' mismatched' reference clause, 2 which has a distinct subject.","[233, 234, 235, 236, 237]"
"24
     Pawley suggests that pauses under 0.2 second should not be considered as markers of TCCU boundaries.
25
     Multiclausal sequences that encode iteration at irregular intervals are an exception to this rule. They may
     form several TCCUs.
330     Chapter 9
(4) Even though TCCUs in SRCs are multiclausal, like clauses, they are restricted to having
three unmarked or core arguments. Clauses typically have one to three arguments that are
not obligatorily marked. These are the syntactic core arguments, subject and obj ect, and the
pragmatic topic (P I ) argument. These arguments are realised as overt NPs and/or by the
subject marker on verbs within the chain. TCCUs are also limited to three core arguments
that are not obligatorily marked.
   However, TCCUs contrast with clauses in their assignment of arguments. In any given
clause, each core argument may be assigned only one syntactic role. In T C C Us, core
arguments may have object role in one clause and subj ect role in a subsequent clause. For
instance ghaito in unit 3 of 9.72 is an overt NP object of the first clause ghaito ruvedo 'they
coil up the pandanus' , the referent of the ellipsed object of fitoro 'they put (it) ' , and the
referent of the ellipsed subject of irari ' it remains' . Peripheral arguments, such as ijida 'in
the sun' in unit 2 of 9.72, are realised as overt PPs wherever they are needed within the unit.
(5) When the scope of negation extends over more than one TCCU, the negative focus
marker jo 'not' must be repeated. In 9.74 thejo appears in the second unit before nunda
dombuda 'before him' and is repeated in the third unit before the negative deverbal form
sae 'not saying' .

(6) Discontinuity-signalling devices define initial and terminal boundaries of TCCUS. z6 The
linguistic evidence at TCCU boundaries suggests that focused or activated concepts in the
speaker' s short-term memory shift slightly. This cognitive shift appears to be registered by
a shift to a less continuous referential coding device on the topic continuity continuum, e.g.
a shift from using verb agreement markers alone to using N Ps. In fact, the primary
26
      Longacre ( 1 972:26-50) in conjunction with several others, notes the existence of ""devices which break
      up chains into subchains"" in many of the chaining languages in Papua New Guinea. He uses Scott's
      material on Fore as an example (pages 27-29). Suffixes which mark verbs that define significant
      multiclause sub-chains in Fore SRCs include: ( I ) three morphemes which indicate that the verbs in the
      chain in which they occur have the same set of participants, (2) the <-aga> set marking DS verbs, (3) the
      suffix -nta, which splits up a chain of ss medial verbs, and (4) two other ' focal' suffixes that embed a
      string which has a different subject.
                                                              Standardised verb sequences and TCCUs         33 1signalling device at TCCU onsets is the occurrence of one to three overt N Ps or PPs. Not
every TCCU must begin with an NP, but there appears to be a strong preference for having
an N P at the beginning of the first TC C U in a sentence after the recapitulating TCCU.
Sometimes, NPs are placed in their own rhythm group (TCCU), preceding the TCCU that
details the interaction of their referents. When this happens, NPs may be copied by a
pronoun within the following TCCU. Pronouns may occur as an initial NP, even when they
are not copying an NP in the previous TCCU.
     Discontinuity at the terminal border of TCCUs may be signalled by any of the following:
( 1 ) the pause indicator avo/avori 'all right';
(2) a terminal clause encoding a temporal notion or followed by a temporal conjunction,
    such as ainda amboda 'after that', ainda gitida ' before that', ainda jokada 'within that
    span', and ainghae dabade 'at the same time';
(3) a determiner (e.g. amo 'thatTlF', ava 'that.CT') or a conj unction (e.g. aindae (sedo) 'on
    account of that' and gido 'so/seeing') following the terminal clause;
(4) a final verb;
(5) a 0 S sequencing medial verb predicating an intransitive clause and expressing a
    resulting effect; or
(6) a o s simultaneous medial verb, except when followed by a perception verb (e.g. gido
    ' seeing' , ningido ' hearing' , bune jaredo 'not knowing and despairing' , itatamedo
    'feeling', bune jaredo 'not knowing and despairing' or tambudo ' finding').
More than one discontinuity signalling device may occur at the terminal boundary of a
TCCU. In one oral text, the following combination terminates a thematic clause chain unit:
dadabetiri ainda amboda, avo . . . ' it finished and after that, all right . . . '
   The following examples illustrate the use of some of the TCCU indicators listed above.
Example 9.75 was segmented into TCCUs by three men, who broke the sentence up at my
request. I expected that they would give me clauses, but they gave me a segmentation by
TCCUs. Although they did break it down into clauses after some discussion, it seems that
the TCCU segmentation was the natural one for them.

           goes along, and seeing (that),27
      In the process of segmenting this sentence, the men regularised the os irrealis form irurari 'while it will
      be going' in the original sentence to the os customary form irureari 'while it goes' to operate in concord
      with the customary form of the sentence final verb, mindiraera 'we eat'.

In example 9.75, the first 3 units commence with an overt N P. The perception verb gido
' seeing' terminates unit 1 . Units 2 and 3 terminate with an intransitive different subj ect
medial verb. Each unit also has its own theme. In unit 1 the kunai grass is burned. The
movement of the wallabies in response to the fire dominates unit 2. In unit 3, a man kills a
wallaby. The coordinated structure gorobai afe gaedo {j ghamanai je basedo 'throw a spear
and pierce and bludgeon with a stone' encodes two methods used in accomplishing the kill.
Unit 4 encodes a movement sequence, expressed by the verbs budo-yama-buvudo ' get-go­
arrive' . In unit 5, the wallaby is roasted, cut and eaten.
   Example 9.76 is from the legend Jaruga Roro.

          she was repeatedly sawing through. '
Each one of the units in this example commences with an overt NP. In fact, the first unit
contains two internal NPs initially: evetu genembo isambu 'all the people' with subject
function and oju bekd ava 'very great fear' with object function. An NP with object function
beka baka 'chatter' is the initial component in unit 2. In unit 3, the initial core NP in a TCCU
is realised by just a pronoun, nu 'she' . The NP in unit 4 has an embedded clause nunda ruka
dighera 'her brother that they had tied' within it. The embedded clause is in a possessive
relationship (indicated by da 'of) with the head noun asi ' vine rope' . There is a slight
pause between this NP and the rest of TCCU.
   In 9.76 unit 1 has just one clause. Unit 2 terminates with an intransitive DS verb form.
Unit 3 is an aspectual clause sequence conveying sporadic iteration of the entire series,
marked by ghuse 'while doing again' . It includes two standardised SVSs direction + motion
verb combinations savi+ya ' go in' and buvu+foa 'come back out' within it.
   Thematically, unit one in 9.76 encodes an emotion, not an action. The state of the
participants involved is the primary semantic focus of unit 2. Unit 3 details the movements
of Jaruga Roro's sister, and unit 4 details the rescue operation she mounts for her brother.
    The previous examples have been SRCs. Example 9.77. which is from a sermon given by
an Anglican evangelist, Oscar Done, exemplifies TCCUs that operate over non-chaining
structures. It contains simple sentences (e.g. units 1 0 and 1 4), chaining sentences (e.g. units
4-8 and unit 9) and co-ranking sentences (e.g. units 1 -3 and 1 1- 1 3). None of the sentences
is conjoined by tail-head linkage. The length in seconds of each TCCU and pause is given in
the parentheses.

In contrast with example 9.73 exemplifying an SRC, in which TCCUs average 2.32 seconds
in length and five words per unit, the TCCUs in example 9.77 average 1 . 1 7 seconds and
three words per unit. The longest unit (unit 1 3 ) is two seconds and contains five words
comprising two clauses, j uxtaposed with each other and predicated by final verbs. No unit
contains more than two clauses, and some contain only NPs or PPs (units 4, 6, 7, 1 1 and 1 2).
Other than the SRC in unit 8 and the CRS in unit 1 3 , all the units are clauses or fragments of
clauses. This is typical of simple sentences and CRSs which tend to obey the general ' one
clause at a time constraint' operative in the delivery of spontaneous connected discourse in
English (Pawley and Syder 1 983 :202).
   TCCUs provide thematic packaging for and thematic continuity in discourses.

                      INTRODUCTION TO KORAFE DISCOURSE   Pike ( 1 954:33, 57) defined a 'discourse' as a ""behavioreme"", a chunk of human
behaviour that has internal structure and a definite beginning and end, recognised by the
cultural community using it. Crystal ( 1 985 :96) gives several definitions of ' discourse'
ranging from ""a behavioural unit which has a pre-theoretical status in linguistics"", to ""a set
of utterances which constitute any recognisable speech event"".
   The discussion of Korafe discourses in the next two chapters is restricted to internally
connected and bounded multi sentence utterances and written texts and their features.
Although the features to be described can also be observed in conversations involving
several Korafe participants, I will concentrate on monologues and written texts, from here
on termed 'texts'. To treat conversations would take us well beyond the limits imposed on
this study.
   A text may be a story that involves participants interacting with each other in events that
build up to a crisis and then are resolved. Or it may expound a theme giving supporting
arguments. It may be a sermon, a letter or an encyclopedic description. Other possibilities
for it exist as well.
    The Korafe employ two basic strategies in their organisation of discourses: ( 1 ) tense­
iconic ordering and (2) thematic organisation. Discourses that have narration of events or
listing of procedures as their basic communicative goal are primarily ordered tense­
iconically. Discourse segments that are tense-iconic have chaining structures as their
primary components. At sentence junctures, they commonly manifest tail-head linkage.
Discourses that illustrate or support themes and topics manifest thematic organisation.
Thematically oriented discourse segments make use of all sentence structures, but are
characterised by frequent use of co-ranking structures, which are linked by juxtaposition or
conjunction.
   These two organisational strategies are useful in differentiating two types of paragraphs
and types of discourses. Section 1 0. 1 describes a prototypical chaining paragraph,
distinguishing it from a thematic one. Section 1 0.2 treats discourse structure rules that
operate across all discourse genres. Discourse structure rules that apply more specifically to
discourses with tense-iconic ordering or thematic organisation are presented in § 1 0.3.
Included in the discussion are speech formulas that signal specific discourse genres.
   The conventional knowledge a speech community shares about the routine activities its
members engage in is often encoded in discourse by structures which represent appropriate
sequences of events in given contexts. These structures are termed scripts. Section 1 0.4                                                336
                                                                      Introduction to Korale discourse     337introduces the notion of scripts, outlining the types of scripts and their standard components
and how they are invoked. Several Korafe scripts with their component parts are then
delineated.","[349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357]"

3 .2.3 PRAGMATIC FUNCTIONS
   The speaker assigns pragmatic functions to NPs in order to communicate his or her
viewpoint to addressees. This NP denotes the topic to be discussed, the salient focal
information which addressees are meant to assimilate, a significant contrast between
entities, or the focus of the speaker's empathy. Unlike NPs marked for semantic roles which
relate to one predicate at the clausal level, N Ps encoding pragmatic functions often21
        The i occurs before the postpositions da (genitive), ghae, de, dae and kena ainda 'of that',
        ainghae/ainde 'with that', aindae ' because of that', and aikena ' in that direction' . The mi is placed
        before da (locative) and go: aminda 'there', amingo 'like that'.
94     Chapter 3reference entities that extend their scope of influence beyond the clause. Some even are
discourse themes.
   Three types of speech-packaging devices are used by Korafe speakers in oral and written
texts : ( 1 ) word order, (2) postpositions and other syntactic markers (including
demonstratives, interrogative-indefinites, and focal pronouns) (3) phonological features.
   Pragmatic functions are highlighted phonologically by accent, stress, p a u s e s and
intonation contours. (See fn.S in this chapter re definitions of accent and stress.) Accent
and stress are used to indicate the focused element in the clause or in the intonation
contour. Accent (or heavy stress) is manifested by increased intensity (amplitude) and/or a
higher pitch on the inherently stressed syllable of the word that receives the main focus of
the segment that correlates with the intonation contour. Accent within the intonational
contour is symbolised below by a double-underlined single quote ( : ). Stress perturbs from
the antepenultimate syllable to the penultimate syllable of future verb suffixes to shift the
focus from the verb to another element in the clause. Examples 3 .93a and b illustrate the
combination of accent and stress to mark the focused unit in two clauses. In 3 . 93a, the
focus is on the verb and the action of going.
                           FOCUS
3 .93a. Na sifo=de        J!:.!jrena.
         1 S day=COM.D gO.DUR-F. I S.FN
         ' I will go tomorrow. (I am definitely going tomorrow, no two ways about it.)'
In example 3 .93b, the focus is on the argument preceding the verb, as indicated by both
accent and perturbed stress on the verb.
           FOCUS
3 .93b. Na s'.(g =de      y-arena.
         I S day=COM.D go.DUR-F. I S.FN
         'I will go tomorrow. (You thought I'd already gone. No, I ' ll be going tomorrow.)'
   Pauses separate the external or pragmatic functions of theme and tail from the main
sentence base(s). Pauses are signalled by punctuation marks such as commas and full stops
in written texts. For examples with themes and tails, see §3.2.3 . 1 . Pauses also mark rhythm
groups, which contain one or more intonation contours and are equivalent to coherent
informational units or thematic clause chain units (TCC us) in sentences. A fuller
explanation of TCCUs is given in §9.3. The intonation contours and amplitude graphs that
characterise statements, questions, and commands are illustrated in §4.7 and its subsections.
   The pragmatic functions Korafe has, the word order demonstrated by these functions and
the morphological indicators of pragmatic functions in Korafe are outlined in the following
sections: 3.2. 3 . 1 , 3 .2.3.2 and 3 . 2 . 3 . 3 .","[113, 114]"

6. 1 ON THE TERM ' SWITCH-REFERENCE' AND THE RANGE OF FUNCTIONS
       PERFORMED BY SRCs
   The term switch-reference by no means indicates the full range of functions encoded by
Korafe medial verb chaining constructions. 4 In addition to referential marking, all Korafe
medial verbs are overtly marked to signal either a sequencing or an overlapping temporal
relationship between the marking and reference clauses. Maintaining an i somorphic
temporal relationship between the clauses in SRCs and the events encoded by them is of
primary importance. Thus, the marked temporal relationships are not tampered with, but
Korafe speakers often allow the referential system to register false coreferential subject
values, as will be illustrated in Chapter 7.
   Haiman and Munro, eds ( 1 983 :ix-x) observe that ""switch-reference appears exotic"",
because the referencing system is attached to the verbs, when one expects it to be attached
to the arguments themselves. However, in Korafe, the term switch-reference is used for a
system that does more than subject referencing . The Korafe switch-reference system
appears to monitor a range of semantic relationships (e.g. temporal, subj ect referencing,
cause-effect in some instances) between clauses. Therefore, it is not surprising that the
marking is on the verb, which is the head of the clause. 54      The tenn switch-reference was originally coined by Jacobsen ( 1 967:240) to signify ""a switch in
       subject or agent...obligatorily indicated by a morpheme ... which may or may not have other meanings.""
       It should be noted that Jacobsen also described coreferential relationships between NP subjects in
       adjacent clauses, encoded by invariable morphemes in Washo and other North American Indian
       languages. Roberts (forthcoming: 30-4 1 ) tallies the number of Papuan languages in his sample with
       invariable morphemes indicating coreferentiality of subject (ss) at 82 and non-coreferentiality of
       subject (os) at 63 . These include Anggor, Boiken. Fasu, Fore, Gahuku, Gadsup, Kalam, Tairora, and
       Arnele. He also indicates (forthcoming: 9, 1 0, 1 8, 99) several that are not marked for person, but only
       for prior or overlap temporal relationships. These include Dadibi, Bahinemo, Sanio, Golin, Sinasina
       and Rumu as well as the Austronesian languages, Takia, Gedaged and Bilbil.
5      Stirling ( 1 993 : 1 1 , 1 36, 3 1 7) believes that the semantic domain of switch-reference is the clause. She
       states: ""Rather than seeing switch-reference as a way of ensuring certain indexing relations between
       NPS, I propose that we see it as giving infonnation about the clause, via giving infonnation about the
       verb"". She agrees with Evans, who rejects the suggestion that switch-reference is 'weird' because it
       violates categorial iconicity. She continues with a quote from Evans ( 1 988:239): ""I believe switch­
       reference ... should be seen as providing infonnation about clauses rather than nominal arguments"".
           Roberts ( 1 988b:75) argues ""that SR, as it is exhibited in Papuan languages, is not primarily a
       syntactic device like reflexivisation or verb agreement for indicating nominal reference, but rather its
       main function is that of a thematic device for linking sentences in text fonnation, and that
       coreferencing certain nominals across clauses is included in, but subsidiary to, this basic function"".
                                                                                                    SRCs      181   Haiman and Munro ( 1 983 :xii) are also puzzled that a ""reference clause i s never
subordinate to a marking clause"". From a Korafe perspective, this fact is consistent with the
temporally iconic relationship that holds between clause sequences in SRCs. It is logical to
assume that the marking clause which signals a prior event could become presupposed
information for the subsequent event signalled by the reference clause. As long as the
clauses are iconically ordered, the temporally subsequent reference clause can never be
subordinate to the temporally prior marking clause.
   In spite of its focus on its referential function, the term switch-reference construction is
used throughout this work, because it i s the term commonly associated in linguistic
descriptions with chaining constructions that have inflected medial verb forms predicating
their sentence-internal bases. It should be kept in mind that SRCs primarily indicate the
temporal and referential relationships that clauses expressing events have with each other.","[200, 201]"

3 .2. 1 SYNTACTIC FUNCTIONS
   Syntactic functions are either external or internal to the clause (Andrews 1 985 :80-8 1 ) .
Noun phrases with external syntactic functions either precede or follow the clause and are
separated from it by pauses. These are associated with pragmatic functions, and detailed in
§3.2.3.
   Syntactic functions that are internal to the clause include both core and oblique
functions. In Korafe, NPS that realise syntactic core functions are unmarked unless
pragmatic considerations come into play, as described in §3 .2.3 . N Ps with core functions
have the grammatical functions that Dixon ( 1 979:59) terms A, S, and 0 and ""any others that
behave like these rather than obliques (Andrews 1 985 :97)"". 1 5 According to Andrews, these15      According to Dixon ( 1 979:59), A, s and 0 are universal semantic-syntactic primitives realised by
        nominal case inflections or cross-referencing on the verb. A represents 'transitive subject', S
        'intransitive subject' and 0 'transitive object'.
82     Chapter 3grammatical functions provide the basis for defining the grammatical relations (i.e. subject,
object) that occur in a given language. The grammatical relation, subject, is identified by a
number of syntactic features in Korafe. See ( 1 )-(4) below.
( 1 ) The subject NP is cross-referenced for person and number on the final verb in the
      clause . Following a nominative-accusative pattern, Korafe verbs cross-reference
      transitive and intransitive subj ects (Dixon' s A and s). Example 3 . 5 1 has two core NPs
      having the grammatical functions, A and o. In this case, the NP with A function ni 'you
      (2S)' is cross-referenced on the verb.","[101, 102]"

     The tenn persistence i s used by Giv6n (in Giv6n, ed. ) 983: 1 2- 1 5) t o refer t o a method o f indicating topic
     continuity in discourse by counting clauses. Persistence is measured in tenns of the number of clauses
     that follow the clause being examined, in which the referent/topic ""continues an uninterrupted presence
     as a semantic argument of the clause"". In Korafe, referents can be arguments in non-consecutive as well
     as consecutive clauses without being invoked by an NP.
3 94      Chapter 1 1    The guidelines for tracking subject and object participants (discussed i n §6.3) are basic
to interpreting who is doing what when there are no overt NPs expounding the syntactic
arguments in clauses. 1 1 These four syntactic tracking rules operative in SRCs are repeated
below with formulas showing subject and object reference. The following notations are
used: C l oSS stands for clause 1 predicated by a SS medial verb; CloDS for clause 1 predicated
by a os medial verb, S=i for the referent of the subject is i, O=j for the referent of the object
is j, IO=j for the referent of the indirect object is j, etc.                                                                                             l

       subject throughout the series.

      understood as the object in all the transitive clauses in a series of clauses that have SS
      medial verbs as predicates until the next overt object NP is introduced.
        C l oSS: O=j + C 2-SS : O=j + C3-SS: O=k + C 4-SS : o=k
                 (k must be invoked by an NP in C3)G-3 : The o�s guideline: the object NP in a marking clause having a os medial verb
      (usually sequencing) as its predicate is understood as the subject in the reference
      clause when no overt NPs are present in the reference clause.

        C l oDS : S=i, o=j, o=k + C2-DS : s =j, o=k
11     Roughly one third of the clauses in tense-iconically ordered discourses have no overt NP arguments.
       Over half of the clauses in many of these discourses do not have overt NPs representing their core
       arguments. Let us look at some examples. The following table gives the name of the text, the number of
       total clauses, the number of clauses with no overt NPs as core arguments, and the number of clauses that
       have no overt NPs. (The number of clauses with no overt NPS is part of the total number of clauses with
       no overt NP core arguments.)

5.4 BONDING AND THE CLAUSAL STATUS OF svcs
   The relationship of the clause to the svc has long been a matter of debate8 among
linguists. There is no simple answer to the question. Are they lexemes, predicates, clauses,
or something more than a clause? The degree of integration or bonding between verb stems
in SVCS can be measured by several variables: ( 1 ) the distance between verbal predicates,8       West African language scholars Williamson ( 1 965), Boadi ( 1 968) and Stahlke ( 1 970) posited that
        some SVcs are derived from multisentence underlying structures, but Schachter ( 1 974:262) proposed
        that ""a verb phrase concatenation"" rather than a multisentence underlying structure is all that is
        necessary. Li and Thompson ( 1 973) saw the possibility of both multiclausal and multic1ausal SVcs in
        Mandarin. Baker's ( 1 989) object-sharing analysis, Schiller's ( 1 989) auto lexical semanticosyntactic
        analysis, and Durie's ( 1 992) fused conceptual structure (that follows lackendoffs linking theory to
        assign more than one semantic role to an N P ) are all attempts to explain a multic1ausal analysis,
        especially of those cases where ""each transitive verb in the series has its own object (Schiller
        1989:405).""
1 66      Chapter 5(2) how many and which argument referents are shared by the predicates, (3) the scope of
inflectional categories (such as negation, tense, aspect, mood) in relationship to the
sequence of verbs, (4) the lexicalisation status of the verbal sequence, and (5) phonological
criteria. On a continuum registering degree of bonding, S V S S that have undergone
phonological reduction and are lexical compounds would be at one end and non-contiguous
SVCs separated by pauses and/or conj unctions at the other end.
   Only a few conventional SVSs have fused phonologically, becoming tightly integrated
lexical compounds. These include posture + iri 'remain' combinations 5 .33a and direction
verb + motion verb sequences 5 .33b.
5 .33a.    jasa+e        +   irira               � jas+ ir-ira (fasirira)
           recline+do    +   remain-PRES.3S.F � recline.do+remain-PRES.3S .FN
           'recline'         ' she is remaining'    'she is lying down'
5.3 3b.     vose         +   a-ira             � vos+a-ira (vosaira)
            descend. !   +   gO.NDUR-TP.3S .FN � descend. HgO.NDUR-TP.3 S .FN
            ' descend'       'he went'           'he descended'
   Quite a number of conventional S V S s recur in Korafe and are utilised as standard
expressions for regularly associated events, e.g. se ningi 'discuss (lit. speak hear)' and kote
do ' forgive (lit. think leave off) ' . They can be considered compound lexemes. Mostly
combinations of two verbs, some of these compound lexemes encode semantic notions,
such as ( 1 ) postural states, (2) directional movements, (3) manner+motion, (4) perception­
communication, and (5) cultural routines. Other compound lexemes have developed a
syntactic relationship in which the final stem has become an auxiliary verb to the initial
lexical one. These convey superlative performance of an action, comprehensive-completive
events, and the conative mood. These lexically and grammatically fixed expressions having
an svc format are more fully explicated in §9. 1 .
   The prototypical svc that Lane and Pawley ( 1 992:6) posit, building on earlier work by
Bradshaw ( 1 982:28) and Crowley ( 1 987 :38, 1 990 :60-6 1 ) does not manifest any clause­
internal boundaries. Their list of characteristics includes the following points:
( 1 ) the two or more verbs that are constituents of SVCs do not contrast in their inflections,
(2) overt morphemes such as coordinators, subordinators or switch-reference markers do
    not occur,
(3) there is no intonational evidence of clause boundary,
(4) core arguments (actor and undergoer) are either identical or the undergoer of the first
    verb becomes the actor of the next,
(5) in some instances, the scope of negation and adverbs extends over the entire sequence
    of verbs.
Foley and Olson ( 1 985 :56-57) specify the nature of argument relationships in SVCS in more
detail. In nuclear layer serialisation, the sequence of verbs is joined in a complex predicate
with one set of arguments. Core layer serialisation joins verbs together that have in
common the set of oblique arguments and one of the core arguments. Their definition of the
                                                                                   SVCs     1 67clause as ""a grammatical structure consIstmg of one and only one non-composite
periphery"" encompasses SVCS joined at both nuclear and core layers.
   Non-contiguous SVCS do not qualify as prototypical SVCs, because they do occur with
coordinators, and because pauses and pause words intervene between verbal constituents.
Some of them do not meet Foley' s and Olson's criteria; they have independent peripheries.
For instance, in example 5 .34, two locations are involved. One is stated in the previous
clause as % % 'the verandas' where the addressees are situated when they get (bu) the
firebrand.
5.34   Sifo eni,          a.   avaraka bu             b.   vose
       day one                 fire    get.!               descend. !
       c . dendegu               ominda              use-vu!
       village. courtyard       that.CEFF. T/F .LOC blow. up.I-IPM .2PL.AQ
       ' One day, get a firebrand (from the fire), get down (from your verandas) and
       get the fire going there in the courtyard). '
The second is encoded b y dendegu ominda 'there i n the courtyard' , the place the addressees
are instructed to move to.
  Contiguous SVCS by and large do qualify as prototypical SVCs, some being joined at the
nuclear layer, illustrated by example 5 .35, and others at the core layer, as in example 5.36.
5.35    ... na /uka=imi            gambu fiti     do=do . . .
               I S pig=CEFF.T/F bite.!    put.I leave.I=SEQ.SS
       ' . . . a pig bit me, put (me) down and left (me) . . . '
In example 5 . 36, sirige ' launch' is transitive and has ghaka 'canoe' as its object, but
sembojighera 'they came across' is intransitive and shares its subject referent only with
sirige.
5.36   . . . ne ghaka sirige        semb+oji+gh-era . . .
            3PL canoe launch.I cross. I+come.NDUR+position-SEQ.PAST.3PL.FN
       , . . . they launched the canoe and came across . . . '
In both of the above examples, each verb contributes its ful l lexical meaning to the
construction; the intransitive combination sembojighera does not gain an object, but just is
meshed with the transitive predicate in a series of events whose borders are left indistinct. It
is possible to convert the verb stem sirige to a medial verb sirigedo, distinguishing more
clearly the temporal relationship between the transitive predicate and the intransitive
compound lexeme without changing the basic meaning of the sequence.
   Some contiguous SVCS terminate with a verb expressing an aspect. For example, the
verb dadabe ' finish' contributes a comprehensive completive meaning when it combines in
                                                                             ,
a serial construction such as mindi dadabe 'utterly consume (lit. eat finish) .
5.37a. Na bayau mindi dadabe-teni.
       IS      food     eaU finish.I-TP. I S .AQ
       ' I totally consumed the portion of food I was given. '
The Korafe cannot change the sequence to 5.37b.
1 68   Chapter 55.37b. *Na bayau mindi-do     dadabe-Ieni.
        I S food eat.I-SEQ.SS finish.l-TP . I S .AQ
The Korafe response to 5.3 7b is laughter. The closest meaning that could be assigned to it
is: I ale food and I terminated. However, animate entities die (ambu); they do not terminate
(dadabe). The lexical verb sequence is acceptable in example 5 .3 7c which contains a
different subject medial verb + verb and encodes the perfective aspect.
5 .37c. Na bayau mind-eno                    dadabe-lira.
        I S food       eat.I-SEQ.R. I S . DS finish.l-TP.3S.FN
        ' I have finished eating.'
    I n example 5.37a, the verb stem + dadabe has fused t o the point where its meaning as a
unit, 'I totally consumed my allotted portion of food' differs from the meaning of its parts,
' I eat' and ' I finish ' . However, the SVC combinations in example 5 . 3 5 and 5 . 3 6 do not
evidence this level of fusion; the meaning of the unit does not differ from the meaning of its
parts. Syntactically, the verbs in 5 . 37a belong to one clause, but in 5 .3 7c, they belong to
two clauses. The semantic difference between casting the verbs in an SVC or in an S R C
(switch-reference construction) is that the SRC makes explicit the temporal relationship
between the events encoded by the verbs. Whereas in the SVC (5.37a) the focus is on the
fact that the food portion was totally consumed, the focus in the SRC (5 .37c) is on finishing
the act of eating.
    What is the clausal status of constructions manifesting core serialisation in which each
of the verbal predicates has its own object? Do they operate as fused units like the aspectual
S V C in 5 . 3 7a? In 5 . 3 8 , the axe (010) is the object of bu ' get' , but the ellipsed object,
jambura 'dugong', is the understood object ofje basiseri 'they gashed and bored' .
5.38    ... 010 b u je           basi-serio
            axe get. I gash.! bore. Ii-DP . I PL .AQ
        , . . . we got an axe and bashed (the dugong) breaking its skin.'
Foley and Olson ( 1 985:44) cite a similar example in Barai, which is given as example 5.39.
5.39    Fu burede ije       sime abe ufu.
        3S bread DEF knife take cut
        ' He cut the bread with a knife.'
They suggest (p.44) that the use of abe 'take' in this Barai example is ""basically a valence­
increasing device; it introduces an instrumental argument into the core frame"". They posit
two role frames for the lexical entry assigned to abe : [A ,U] and [A,U,I]lvt. They note that
predicates in SVCs bond together forming a complex nucleus to which the entire set of
arguments must relate as a unit.
   It is not clear in Korafe that the use of bu 'get' in these cases is basically a valence­
increasing device, introducing an instrumental argument into the core frame. It is often
juxtaposed with transitive verbs in Korafe when the resultant combination does not involve
an instrumental reading. Examples like nu 010 bu mutira 'he got the axe and gave it', or nu
ghamana bu gira 'he got the rock and looked at it' , or nu 010 bu vegelira 'he got the axe
and sharpened it' are all possibilities.
                                                                                     SVCs    1 69   The verb bu appears to contribute its full lexical value to the SVC sequence in the same
way as its corresponding medial form budD does to the SRC medial verb sequence, which is
multiclausal and preserves separate role frames for the verbs. Instruments can be marked by
i or imi without occurring with the verb bu. And the verb bu can have as its syntactic object
an instrument marked by imi. Examples 5 .40a and b use the same lexical sequence as 5 .3 8 .
5 .40a.   . . . genembo gi-do,         goraba a=imi         ale     gae-do,

          and gets rocks and gashes and punctures (the wallabies with them) and they die . . . '
The version given in 5 .40b is a revision of 5.40a, made by a Korafe editor. It uses
customary medial forms, a shortened version of the effector of change marker i and the
verb stem bu in place of the medial form budo.
5 .40b.   . .. gi-do,       goroba=i ale       gae-do,        ii  ghamana=i bu

           ' . . . the man sees (the wallabies hopping) and he throws spears and impales them
          and gets rocks and gashes and punctures (the wallabies with them) and they die . . . '
The verb sequences used in 5 .40 represent the standard event schema the Korafe use to
describe hunting and killing wallabies. In example 5 .40a, the obj ect ghamana 'rocks' is
marked by aimi ' with that' and serves as the obj ect of the medial form, budD 'get' and the
understood instrument of je basari ' he will gash and puncture ' . The use of the fuller
marking aimi places extra focus on the instrument. In 5.40b, the use of the short form of the
effector of change marker i without a demonstrative places less emphasis on the
instrumental argument. When the instrument is unmarked and merely functions as the
object of bu 'get' , as in example 5 .38, the verb it occurs with represents an event that is
slightly more individuated and less integrated with the following events than its marked
counterpart. The verb sequence bu je basiseri 'they got, gashed, and bored' terminates
example 5 .38, but the sentence that follows it in the narrative begins with the sequence, Je
basetera, without bu. The omission of bu in the recapitulated segment suggests that it may
not be bound as tightly to je basiseri as the latter two verbs are bound to each other.
   Durie ( 1 992:48-5 1 ) also notes that some SVCs appear to allow for multiple thematic role
assignments. Like Foley and Olson, he prefers a solution using semantic notation in the
lexicon to j ust ""permitting multiple role assignments and saying nothing more"". His
solution preserves the integrity of the original role frame for the instrumental verb. He
assumes that an argument can bear different semantic roles simultaneously and employs
1 70      Chapter 5lackendoff s9 notational system to illustrate the conceptual structures available to TAKE.
Durie initially assigns TAKE (bu in Korafe) the PATIENT role it has with oto ' axe ' . He then
argues that this structure assumes an INSTRUMENTAL role in the overall configuration of the
conceptual structure of the SVC (oto bu je basiseri in Korafe). Thus, he argues for a fusion
of ""the argument structures, allowing for an integrated set of semantic roles"".
   Applying Durie's solution to Korafe would greatly increase and complicate the entries in
the lexicon. One would have to apply this instrumental analysis to quite a number of verbs,
e.g. ale 'throw' , bambu ' gather' , keve 'carve' , dighi 'tie', tendi ' lash' as well as bu 'get',
which themselves occur with many different verbs i n svcs. IO However, i f we allow that the
lexicon can be as large as the lexicographer chooses, what are the criteria determining
entries? Do we want discontinuous verb sequences to count as lexemes? The alternate
strategy Durie mentions-""permitting multiple role assignments""-seems preferable for
Korafe.
Fusion of predicate frames seems impossible in cases where Korafe non-contiguous SVCS
exhibit switches in subjects as well as the switches in objects. Switches in subject reference
that are not overtly coded by the verbal morphology may occur in: ( 1 ) cases of referential
overlap, (2) constructions expressing physiological and psychological responses, (3)
changes of temporal, spatial, and circumstantial settings, and (4) cases where distinct verbal
predicates encode perception and the perceived entity. Referential overlap is exhibited in
example (5.4 1 ). The subject shifts from na ' I ' to nangae ' we two' between vose 'I descend'
and mindorasi ' let' s us two eat, that was said! '5.41         a.   na viti                  b.     jegha=6       bu                  c.    vose       nangae
                  I S ascend.!                    pandanus=that get.I                     descend. I I DU.COM
             mind-or-asi!
             eat.I-H. I PL-that.say.II
             'I will climb up and get the pandanus fruits, climb down and let's eat them the two
             of us (repeated quotation)! '
Although no shift in subject reference i s indicated at lange ' open' in example 5 .42, the
subject Ghebu Mose is not the subject of atetira ' it dawned', sifo 'day' i s. In fact in this
change of temporal setting, the two verbal predicates do not share any argument referents.5 .42a.      Ghebu+ Mose            diti lange
             ghebu. tree+young.lady eye open.!
9         lackendoff ( 1 990) restricts role-doubling by determining which 9-role is dominant in the bound
          complex of 9-roles (the entire set available to the svc). The fused set of 9-roles for an individual verb
          (also termed its fused conceptual structure) arises from the role structures it evidences in its lexical
          entries.
10
          Schiller (J 989:4 1 5) notes that ""so many verbs can take instrumental oblique objects that it would seem
          that most transitive verbs should be treated as triadic"". He suggests freely permitting instrumental
          complements for transitive verbs and requiring lexical licensing for directional and goal complements.
          Durie ( \ 992:46) himself notes that Kalam also manifests proliferation of ""instrumental verbs"".

In example 5 .43, the girl is understood to be the subject of ere ' she arose' , but she has no
role in the event encoded by the following predicate, sandi aviri 'they grabbed and slept' (a
euphemism for having sexual relations) . She just sees it.

Such subj ect shifts mirror the apparent anomalies that the switch-reference system exhibits
and are more fully discussed in Chapter 7. These examples with their distinct sets of
arguments appear to be multiclausal like the switch-reference examples they mirror.
  Thus, Korafe data appear to ""permit multiple role assignments"" in some SVcs. These
SVCs are defined by having one or more of the following characteristics:
( 1 ) embedded clauses and quotations (examples 5 .20 and 5 .25) intervene between verb
      stems,
                                                                II
(2) pauses, pause words, and conjunctions occur,
(3) the verbal constituents themselves indicate shifts in location and temporality or have
    separate role frames that characterise peripheral or clausal junctures (Foley and Olson
    1 985 :56-57). (For Korafe examples, see examples 5 . 1 6 and 5 .34.)
   When the entire set of Korafe SVCs, both contiguous and non-contiguous is accounted
for, the continuum registering the degree of bonding of verb sequences extends from fused
lexical verb compounds to clauses and complex constructions that appear to be more than
one clause. As Lane and Pawley ( 1 992: 1 9) suggest, ""there is no natural break between
multiclause and single-clause constructions, only a continuum of types"". Most SVCs fit
Foley and Olson' s typology which extends the single-predicate clause to accommodate a
multilayered clausal approach, in which the SVc has only one role frame. However, not all
Korafe S V C S fit within these single clausal limits . Some, like the switch-reference
constructions, are joined at the peripheral layer. The deviations from prototypical SVCs that
non-contiguous serial verb constructions manifest are indicative of their ambiguous
position between monoclausal SVCS and multiclausal SRCs. They have the morphology of
SVCs, but syntactically and phonologically, they often manifest multiclausal features.","[185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191]"

      Halliday's definition of the word 'theme' is more inclusive than Dik's. Both the clause-internal

8     It is not always true, however, that ""the cognitive point of departure coincides with the communicative
      point of departure"" (Lyons 1 977: 508). Mithun ( 1 987:304) observes that word order does not always
      begin with given information or even the topic of discussion. She has found in the American Indian

linked by the conjunction ava sedo 'therefore (lit. saying that)'.

         ' Because each and everyone of her children have died, grief has come and buried
         and overwhelmed her.'
In examples 8 . 1 0 and 8 . 1 1 , the dependent thematic base is not asserted, so the verbs deteva
'you hit' and amomonjegusera 'each and every one of them died' are marked as neutral in
terms of assertion. Both bases in paratactic arrangements are asserted, whereas in structures
expressing a hypotactic relationship, only the final independent base is asserted.
256      Chapter 8(3) Semantic relationships between co-ranking bases
   Although both bases in paratactic relationships are independent, semantic relationships
bind them together, just as they bind dependent bases in hypotactic relationship with
dominant bases. According to Halliday ( 1 98 5 : 1 93-25 1 ), the logicosemantic relations of
expansion and proj ection occur between bases of sentences in both paratactic and
hypotactic relationships.
   Halliday describes three types of expansions: ( 1 ) elaborations, (2) extensions, and
(3) enhancements. One base elaborates another base, by expressing it in other words, giving
examples of it or clarifying it. Extensions include additions of new information,
alternatives, adversatives and other variations. One base enhance� another by qualifying it
temporally, spatially, or in its manner. Enhancement relationships also occur between two
bases in a conditional or cause-effect relationship. Sections 8 . 1 to 8 . 8 outline Korafe
sentences encoding expansion.
   Halliday refers to constructions that contain direct or indirect quotes as 'projections' . A
proj ection has a ' locution' or mental process base which ' instates' a second base as a
quotation or thought. In Korafe, quotations are commonly bracketed by initial and final
locution bases. Korafe projections are presented in §8.9.
  Sentences with hypotactic bases that function as sentential complements or relative
constructions are described in § 8 . 1 0 and § 8 . 1 1 .
   Section 8 . 1 2 focuses on intersentential relationships and the conjunctions used. For the
most part, the same logicosemantic relationships existing between bases in sentences also
bind sentences together.","[274, 275, 276]"

1 .7 METHODS AND MATERlALS
   The data used in preparing this book were primarily collected in the village of Baga,
where my husband and I began research as members of the Summer Institute of Linguistics
(SIL) in 1 972. They come from a variety of sources. Some are spontaneous spoken texts
recorded on tape, transcribed and checked with informants. Others are written materials
produced and edited in Korafe writers' workshops involving about 30 Korafe men and
women (see Farr and Farr 1 979, 1 980a,b,c; Farr and Seko 1 978; Nunisa 1 993). Some
examples have been taken from the Korafe New Testament, revised by three different
teams of men and women and published in 1 984. Texts collected after 1 98 1 , re-edited texts,
and sentences elicited from a committee of three men and checked by other Korafe
speakers have also provided some of the examples. A concordance of the spontaneous
spoken texts and the written texts gathered before 1 9 8 1 was compiled and processed at the
SIL Computer Laboratory at Ukarurnpa in 1 98 1 . It consists of 6 1 ,053 morphemes.
   Among the materials prepared in the vernacular are primers and reading books for use in
Korafe pre-schools as well as a New Testament and an Anglican Prayer Book with hymns
included. Work on a Korafe-English dictionary (Nunisa et al. forthcoming) is in progress,
with more than 5,000 entries currently. Published technical materials include a preliminary
20    Chapler Jphonology (Farr and Farr 1 974), an analysis of the effects contact with the Western world
has had on Korafe society (C.J.M. Farr 1 974), a morphological sketch (Farr and Farr 1 975),
and articles on the uses of 'come' and 'go' (C.J.M. Farr 1 976), causation (J. Farr 1 9 80),
conjunctions (c. Farr 1 98 1 ), focus spaces (1. Farr 1 9 8 1 ), topic, contrast and control (Farr et
al. 1 9 8 1 ), demonstratives (Farr and Whitehead 1 982), explanation in Korafe and English
(Farr, Lowe, and Whitehead 1 985), and the switch-reference system (C.J.M. Farr 1 993).
                                          CHAPTER 2
                                       KORAFE VERBS
  Korafe verbs function as the only obligatory constituent in clauses or simple sentences,
usually occurring clause-finally.
   Verb forms can be distinguished at three levels of structural complexity reflecting the
number and kind of affixes: stem, non-finite forms, and finite forms with absolute or
relative tense markers. From the perspective of syntactic function, these stems, non-finite
and finite forms are used as predicating verbs in two basic sentence types termed by
Longacre ( 1 985 :258) ""co-ranking"" and ""chaining"" sentences.
   Korafe co-ranking sentences are made up of clauses with predicating verbs at the same
level of structural complexity: finite verb forms with absolute tense markers. Chaining
structures commonly manifest verbs with differing levels of structural complexity, internal
verbs being less finite or temporally specified than the terminal verb. Stems are the basic
non-final verbal components of serial verb chaining constructions (svcs). Both non-finite
and finite verb forms with relative tense markers terminate internal clauses in switch­
reference constructions (SRCs). Verbs occurring as non-final components of SRCs are called
medial verbs because of their ipso facto distribution sentence-medially and their general
inability to function as isolated utterances. SRCs manifest the same iconic order as
the events they represent and track the salient referent in tense-iconically ordered
discourses.
   The terms marking clause and reference clause (Haiman and Munro 1 983 :xii) are used
to facilitate the description of interclausal relationships in SRCs in Korafe. Marking clauses
precede reference clauses and use reference clauses as their standard of temporal and
referential comparison. A medial verb terminating a marking clause is marked to indicate
that the event it represents precedes (sequencing: SEQ) or overlaps with (simultaneous: SIM)
the event expressed by the reference clause. The medial verb in the marking clause also
signals coreferentiality of subject (marked ss) or shift of subj ect reference (marked D S)
between the two clauses. Reference clauses serve as marking clauses for subsequent
adjacent clauses in S RCs, except for SRC terminal reference clauses which terminate with
final verbs.","[39, 40, 41]"

1 0.4 SCRIPTS
   Meaning is communicated and interpreted within a context. We have already touched on
syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic contexts within which Korafe discourses are framed and
16
      The letter writer may replace the singular command form gi with the stentorian form giyo or the plural
      command form givu.
370      Chapter 1 0the discourse rules that apply. This section focuses on scripts 1 7 and the role they play in the
cognitive organisation of meaning.
     As part of their theory that human ""memory is organised around personal experiences
(episodes) rather than around abstract semantic categories"" (p. 1 7), Schank and Abelson
( 1 977: 1 1 , 1 7- 1 8, 3 6-45) posit the concept of scripts. In their view, a script is ""a
predetermined, stereotyped sequence of actions that defines a well-known situation"" (p.4 1 ).
It covers several similar episodes and can be economically stored in the memory. The script
is a convenient tool, like a template in a computer program, that can be manipulated to suit
the speaker' s purposes. Scripts are conceptual constructs that get instantiated in the stories
speakers tell and authors write.
   Schank and Abelson appear to extend their definition of ' script' beyond a mental
construct to discourse structure rules which specify the things to be said and the order in
which they must be said. They view scripts as rule-ordered causal chains in which each new
action must be completed satisfactorily before the next action in the sequence. They
maintain that scripts are composed of ""slots and requirements about what can fill the slots.
The structure is an interconnected whole and what is in one slot affects what can be in
another . . . Scripts allow for new references to objects within them just as if these objects had
been previously mentioned; obj ects within a script may take 'the' without explicit
introduction because the script itself has already implicitly introduced them . . . A script must
be written from one particular role' s point of view"". It is probably more accurate to
associate discourse structure rules with what Schank and Abelson call 'script application' . 1 8
   The information i n this section i s garnered from linguistic representations o f scripts (or
script applications) in Korafe. Schank's and Abelson' s outline of the components
associated with scripts is utilised to discuss what appear to be some of the Korafe scripts. In
addition to the event sequence that is the backbone of the script, the roles the actors assume,
props, preconditions, and results are also associated with the script. Mechanisms must also
exist for invoking a script (termed ' headers' ) and for recovering steps left out in the
particular account (termed 'script appliers').
  For example, a restaurant script can be activated by mentioning a header such as the
word ' restaurant' and a precondition header such as ' Susie was hungry' . Roles associated
with a restaurant script include the waiter, the cook, the patron, the cashier, and the owner.","[389, 390]"

             CONTINUITY
  Example 1 l . 1 , is a free translation from the legend Yutara Gimasa ' Red-Speckled­
Parrotfish Young Man'. It illustrates the use of temporal and locative bridging devices in
changing venues.
   The main characters are the wife of the leader, her lover Yutara Gimasa ' Red-Speckled­
Parrotfish Young Man', the boy Gajarideka, who plays the role of the tattletale, and the
leader, who is the boy' s father.
   In this legend, the primary setting is the village, which is the home of the main
participants. The only temporary setting in this segment of the legend is the beach in scene
two. Other episodes are told in passing, and the primary setting is retained as the deictic
centre of activity. The setting indexes are italicised, the English encoding of the movement
or the temporal span is underlined, and the actually Korafe words are in bold print in
brackets.

1 1 . 1 .4 ACTION CONTINUITY/DISCONTINUITY: FOREGROUNDING AND BACKGROUNDING
     ""Action continuity pertains primarily to temporal sequentiality within [a]
     thematic paragraph, but also to temporal adjacency therein.""
                                                           (Giv6n, ed. 1 983 : 8)
   In Korafe narratives, action continuity is maintained by sequences of clauses that
iconically reflect the temporal order of the actions they represent.
   Two hypotheses about action continuity are assumed in this discussion. The first is that:
structures maintaining action continuity convey foregrounded information. Foregrounded
information can be defmed by two criteria:
( 1 ) Foregrounded events are the important, indispensable events of the narrative, those that
      constitute its ' skeleton' or ' backbone' . (Wallace 1 982:208-209; Hopper 1 979a:6 1 ,
      1 979b:2 1 6 and Hopper and Thompson 1 980:280-28 1 )
(2) Foregrounded clauses are ordered i n temporal sequence. According to Labov and
    Waletzky ( 1 966) and Labov ( 1 972:360), a minimal narrative is ""a sequence of two
    clauses which are temporally ordered: that is, a change in their order will result in a
    change in the temporal sequence of the original semantic interpretation"".
  The second hypothesis is that: chaining structures convey foregrounded information in
Korafe. SRCS are the primary indicators of temporal sequentiality and adjacency in Korafe.
384     Chapter 1 1Thus, medial verbs which constitute the majority o f the bases o f SRCs are the primary
indicators of temporal sequentiality and adjacency in Korafe. Although the notion of
foregrounding correlates with independent clause syntax in much of the literature (Hopper
1 979b:2 1 6; Labov 1 972 :362) and medial verbs are syntactically dependent, SRCs and other
chaining structures demonstrate many of the characteristics attributed to foregrounded
narrative text.
( 1 ) The clauses in an SRC cannot be reversed in order without changing the semantic
      interpretation of the text.
(2) Sequencing medial verbs manifest strict tense-iconic sequencing in which each
    represented event must be completed before the subsequent event commences.
(3) Clause components of SRCs relate events that are indispensable to the narrative; the
    story would be incoherent if one only considered the independent final verbs to be
    fore grounded event-line.
(4) Most of the subjects refer to human entities and are clearly identified.
  Therefore, chaining structures (SYCS, SRCS, chaining paragraphs) are considered to
encode foreground information.
   Action is suspended in discourse in order to provide background information,
""secondary information that is used to clarify the narrative."" (Grimes 1 975 :56) In Korafe
narratives, background information is often signalled by discrepancies in the switch­
reference tracking system, which were outlined in Chapter 7. Some background infomation,
called ' off-line background' in this thesis, encodes states and events that do not fit
temporally within the event sequence encoded by the main event-line. However, there is
another category of background that dovetails temporally with events belonging to the main
event line. 3 These are coded by a mismatch in subject referencing between marking and
reference clauses in Korafe are termed 'on-line background' . They encode physiological
and emotional responses, temporal, meteorological and circumstantial settings, and the
semi-coterminous activities of two sets of participants as seen from the viewpoint of one of
the sets.
   Texts express only one event at a time. Therefore, tracking the separate but simultaneous
activities of the participants of two independent events poses problems for maintaining
action continuity in SRCs. Acknowledging this problem, Hopper ( 1 979b:39, 6 1 ) and others
have suggested that an event marked as simultaneous with another event is a backgrounded
event.
   As mentioned above, when the participant' s actions overlap, the Korafe often present
one participant' s activities as foregrounded events and the other' s as on-line background,
perceived from the foregrounded participant's viewpoint. (Examples can be found in §7.3 .3.)      Thompson ( 1 987:445-448) also notes that some temporally sequenced clauses in English should not be
      called foreground. She believes that those subordinate clauses that are ""on the time line are doing other
      discourse work in addition to naming a temporally sequenced event"", such as orienting another event
      back to the ongoing temporal line and interpreting events in their order of importance.
                                                                   Cohesion, prominence and dominance        385   Alternatively, one can suspend tense-iconic ordering, detail both participants' distinct
activities in j uxtaposed sentences, and then resume temporal ordering by recapitulating all
the preceding activities by a generic verb. The author chooses that option in example 1 1 .2,
interrupting temporal sequencing at the final verb, vasai useri ' we became rival trading
partners' .
1 1 .2      Namane sarige-do         vasai+u-seri.

            quarrel+do. I-SEQ.R.3PL.DS IS
            'They quarrelled, and I . . . '
The actions and failures of both groups are recapitulated by the generic verb aminguse
'acting that way', and the narrative is resumed.
   In example 1 1 .3, the partition of the participants at nengae 'the two of them' seems to be
sufficient4 to interrupt action continuity. Like other Korafe examples of synchronised
actions, the participants' individual activities are recorded and recapitulated by a generic
verb.
1 1 .3      . . . aminge se-do,          nengae, Kokora nu kokora + aito              iri,
                  that.do.! saY.I-SEQ.SS 3D      Kokora 3S rooster+step               do.SIM.R.3S .DS

            Cassowary       3S cassowary+step do.II-SIM.SS do.thus'!-SEQ.SS 3D
4        In the other cases, a fmal verb is used to signal suspension of the action. Other than this pronoun, this
         SRC maintains action continuity. The verb kokora ai/a iri ' while he was miming the rooster' s
         movements' does allow for total overlap with the final verb boke aito etira ' h e was miming the
         cassowary's movements' .
386        Chapter 1 l            se-teri. . .

            , . . . they spoke thus, and the two of them, Rooster was doing his rooster step,
            and Cassowary was doing his cassowary step, and they said . . . '
   However, other instances of overlapping events are encoded by simultaneous medial
verbs in SRCs where there is no disruption in action continuity. They have realis status and
can not be moved anywhere else in the sequence without perturbing temporal iconicity, like
sequencing medial verbs that are foregrounded clauses. Hopper ( 1 979b:2 1 6) lists among
the properties that distinguish backgrounded events those that encode simultaneity.
However, simultaneous medial verbs appear to belong to the foregrounded event line in
Korafe. Let us examine some examples.
   Example 1 1 .4 is an S RC with two simultaneous medial verb forms as well as several
sequencing medial verb forms. Each medial verb encodes an event on the main event line,
expressed by this SRC. None of these verbs can be interchanged in Korafe without altering
the meaning, because the initial event that overlaps with following events precedes them as
well. The overlap in these examples is not fully coterminous.

            he was bathing, that woman turned around and came and said to her co-wife . . . '
The translation of the simultaneous medial verb forms gosiri 'she was watching, and while
she was watching' and gutiri 'he was bathing and while he was bathing' indicates that these
verbs have two semantic functions: ( 1 ) to encode an event in the SRC sequence, and (2) to
indicate that this event overlaps temporally with subsequent events. Both gosiri and gutiri
signal events that have a definite initial point on the main event line. However, at the point
where the next action begins, they overlap 5 with that action. In the case of gosiri, it can be
inferred that the co-wife's observation of her husband's actions overlaps with all the actions
that are listed right up to and partially including his bathing. The temporal extent of her
         For Labov and Waletzky ( 1 966:25, 27), a narrative clause has a displacement range that does not extend
         past the actual location of some following clause and conversely does not extend past the actual location
         of the given preceding clause. Their displacement sets may in fact overlap, but the displacement set of£
         will not include Q and vice versa if £ and Q are temporally altered. The simultaneous medial verb gosiri
         extends over 3 clauses, so it does not meet their criteria for a narrative clause.

fugutiri 'she was throwing away, and while she was throwing away' has its place on the
event line, commencing before the son's action, but also overlapping it. The temporal
extent offugutiri is not clearly indicated.

In so far as medial verbs expressing overlapping events indicate an event on the main event
line, they can be treated as foregrounded. But they are backgrounded with respect to the
subsequent event(s) with which they overlap.
   Like the simultaneous verbs SS sequencing durative medial verbs are imperfective verbs,
which also should encode backgrounded events if Hopper's list of features of background is
used. Unlike other SS medial verbs, they are inflected not only for imperfective aspect, but
also for absolute tense and person and number of subject. They have the same form as final
dependent verbs have. (Paradigms for and a discussion of these forms appear in §2. 5 . 1 .)
However, these verb forms expressing time spans appear to realise events that have the
same foregrounded status on the event line as sequencing non-durative medial verbs.
    Five verbs encode most instances of sequencing durative actions in Korafe SRCs: iri
'remain', fu 'come', i ' go' , avi 'sleep' and deinghe ' walk ' . They are used to introduce
participants, to link discourse episodes together (this includes carrying the story line along
over time segments in which nothing particularly salient happened). They are also used to
indicate the participants' movement from one venue to another and to orient the addressee
to the temporal and spatial settings in the discourse. Let us look at examples 1 1 .6 and 1 1 .7
to review some of these uses. In example 1 1 .6, the writer moves (jena ' I came') his canoe
to a new destination and moors it. The verb irisena ' I was remaining' covers an indefinite
span of time in the story when nothing happened, the time between mooring his canoe and
the moment when he noticed that fish were trapped in his net.

         , . . .I came and moored the pole anchoring the canoe, and I remained until I saw
         that fish got caught in the net, and I arose to get them . . . '
The verb deinghe ' walk' is used to refer generally to all the activities one engages in when
away from the village. In example 1 1 .7, it just marks the time the father was away from the
village.

The functions of all five verbs in temporal and spatial orientation within discourses are
discussed in § 1 1 . 1 . 1 and § 1 1 . 1 .2.
    When the SS sequencing durative medial paradigm occurs with verbs other than the five
verbs discussed above, the verb is usually followed by a medial form of e 'do' (edo, etiri,
etc.), which signals that the event span is terminated. In example 1 1 .8, the verb eregutara
' she was bathing' indicates a significant main event, albeit a bit protracted in length. Its
terminus is marked by edo.

         water=LOC descend.r float.off.I-SEQ.SS go.NDUR-TP.3S.FN
         it went down into the water and floated off.'
As is clearly indicated when edo marks the terminus, these durative events are viewed
perfectively, as a whole activity, ""whose completion is a necessary prerequisite to a
subsequent event"" (Hopper 1 979b:2 1 6).
   Hopper ( l 979a:38) says that foregrounded events ""carry the narrative forward"". Like
sequencing non-durative medial verbs, sequencing durative and simultaneous medial verbs
do carry the event line along or link events together, so that an unbroken string of events is
                                                                 Cohesion, prominence and dominance         389recorded. These forms reflect ambiguities in their form and function that make them less
than perfect candidates for the foregrounded event line. 6 However, they do not interrupt
action continuity and cannot be reordered without altering meaning�haracteristics which
make me reluctant to relegate them to background. If foregrounded material are the events
that constitute the 'backbone' of the story, could these forms perhaps be the cushioning
cartilage between the vertebrae (event segments) of the backbone?","[402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409]"
"
23
       As Delancey ( 1 98 1 :632) expresses it, ""events have an inherent natural AF [ATTENTION FLOW], which
       recreates the flow of attention involved in actually witnessing the event"". The speaker with a different
       perspective on events may rearrange NPs to reflect his or her viewpoint.
24
       Delancey (1981 :627-628,644) labels the animacy hierarchy the 'empathy hierarchy', incorporating the
       following distinctions: SAP (speech-act participants) > 3rd pronouns > human > animate > natural
       forces > inanimate.
25
       Korafe does not have passive voice. However, objects can be topicalised (one of the functions of the
       English passive construction) by fronting them in osv-ordered clauses. Unlike English, the agent NP in
       the Korafe construction is not demoted to an obi ique function; it sti II is cross-referenced as subject on
       the verb.
                                                                            Noun phrases   993 . 1 06c. *Evetu+genembo juumi              gamb-eari

Only when the subject is distinguishable from the deictic or cultural context may all the
core arguments in OS V constructions remain unmarked. In practice, this means that only

3 .2.3.2 MARKERS INDICATING PRAGMATIC FUNCTIONS
  The three main information-marking postpositions that indicate pragmatic functions are :
mo, { imi} , { va} . The following example illustrates their use in a similar context.
THEMEffOPIC :
3 . 1 1 0a. Elijah=mo, mara,           amb-ira.
            Elijah=T/F what.a.pity die. I-TP.3S.FN
            ' Regarding Elijah, what a pity, he has just died.'
CONTRAST (EXHAUSTIV E FOCUS OF CONTRAST):
3 . 1 1 0b. Elijah a=va      amb-ira,       jo Simon ir-ae=ri.
            Elijah that=CT die. I-TP.3S.FN not Simon remain-not.do=COP.AQ
            'It was Elijah that died, not Simon.'
1 00   Chapter 3EFFECTOR OF CHANGE:
3. 1 1 0c. 0 genembo={ ambu-raira        a=mo,    evetu a=in=dae
           or man=CEFF die.l-CUST.3 S.FN that=T/F woman that=CEFF=BEN          rori      se-raera.
          widow say .I-CUST. I PL.FN
          (lit. 'Or when a man dies, we say ""widow"" about (his) wife.') 'A man 's
          death causes his wife t o become a widow' .
As examples 3 . 1 1 Ob and c indicate, these three information markers commonly occur in
combination with demonstratives.
   The postposition mo26 regularly marks left-dislocated THEMEs [P2 ] . N Ps marked by mo
can reference either entities that are newly introduced, or entities that the speaker assumes
the addressee is familiar with, because they are already 'evoked ' or inferrabl e27 from
background knowledge (such as generic entities) (Prince 1 98 1 :236). The NP marked by mo
in example 3 . 1 1 1 i s a new theme anchored in the text' s overall or global theme :
cassowaries.
3 . 1 1 1 Nun=da tataya=mo, ala a=imi                         e-raira.
          3S=GEN fight=T/F           feet that=CEFF.T/F do.l-CUST.3S.FN
          ' About its fighting, it does (it) with its feet. '
PPs can also be marked by mo. In example 3 . 1 1 2 , mo marks the setting introducing a
description of the customary behaviour of teenagers in the ancestors' time.
3 . 1 1 2 Giti avia+abua=da                  sifo=da=mo, ade+vide ne

        ' At first in our grandparents' day, teenagers while remaining with their parents . . .              '
  The mo also occurs often with TOPIC NPs [P I ] in topic-comment copular clauses, as
example 3 . 1 1 3 illustrates.
3 . 1 1 3 Oka+sesema=mo              tamo+foyago=ri.
          fish+hammerhead.shark=T/F body+white=cop .AQ
          ' The hammerhead shark is white.'","[118, 119, 120]"
"   Twenty-four years ago when my husband, our son Jamie and I went to Tufi, we did not
realise how deep our relationships with the Korafe people would go. They not only allowed
us to study their language; they welcomed us into their family! We appreciate the help and
generosity of all the Korafe and Mokorua people in the Tufi area, particularly the people of
Baga Village where we settled. We are deeply indebted to Justus and Rhoda and Brigitte

       that is causing the dogs to growl while they 're eating it?'
The coreference status of the subjects in the terminal clause of purpose constructions with
the subjects of matrix clauses is also monitored. As terminal predicates in purpose
constructions, deverbal forms indicate coreferentiality of subject and os irrealis medial verb
forms indicate disparity of subject. This is illustrated in the examples in 3 . 5 5 .
3 .55a Same Subject:
       Na Tufi y-ari=dae          er-ena.
       1 S Tufi gO.OUR-OYB=PUR IPF-do.PRES ..l.S..FN
       'I'm about to go to Tufi.'
3.55b Different Subject:

      3S 1 S Tufi gO.OUR-SEQ.IR..l.S..OS=PUR IPF-say-PRES.1S,.FN
      ' He is saying that I will (must) go to Tufi.'
(3) Korafe has focal actor pronouns (pronoun stem marked by -ne, as in nane ' I', nene
    'you all/they ') which only copy or replace subject NPs (with animate referents). No
    matter where this pronoun is placed in the ordering of constituents in the clause, it
    clearly identifies the subject.
(4) When a predication is deverbalised, only the subject relation can assume a genitive
    relationship with the deverbal nominative.
As the subject in example 3 . 5 6b, Kokombara can be the possessor of the act of running
(sumbari). But '60' cannot, so 3 .56c is ill-formed.
3 .56a. Kokombara 60 sumb-ira.
        Kokombara 60 run.I-TP.3S.FN
        ' Kokombara ran fast (like 60 miles an hour). '

        ' Kokombara' s prowess in running'
3 .56c. *60=da     sumb-ari
         60=GEN    run.I-OBY
    Objects are defined negatively in Korafe as those core NPs with the grammatical
function 0 that are not cross-referenced by verbal suffixation. In addition, however, they
are the only NPs that can be relativised on in second position, their normal position. This is
illustrated by the obj ect bare 'taro seedlings' in example 3 . 57.
84       Chapter 33 . 57    Edna bare           nandae futu-sira         a=va,            gov-ari=dae

          ' I am about to plant those taro seedlings that Edna gave me.'
   Animate recipients (marked dae o r kena) and inanimate locative arguments (marked da)
in Korafe can be unmarked and placed before the object when they act as participants. See
the discussion on LOCUS arguments in §3.2.2. 1 .
   NPs internal to the clause that do not have core grammatical functions (A, S, and 0) have
oblique functions. Except for a few lexical exceptions that are listed below, NPs with
oblique functions have the structure of postpositional phrases. These phrases consist of
noun phrases marked by morphologically autonomous postpositions which cliticise to the
final constituent of the noun phrase. In example 3 . 58 the locative marker da 'at, in, to '
follows both NPs headed by fororo ' mud' .
3.58      a.   fororo=da                b. fororo raugo=da
               mud=LOC                     mud soft=LOC
                ' in the mud'              ' in the soft mud'
  NPs with oblique function basically correspond to and overlap with the set of
postpositional phrases that indicate circumstantial semantic case arguments.
   In contrast to NPs with core functions that get marked to indicate pragmatic functions,
those with oblique function lose their semantic case marking and are fronted when they
have the pragmatic role of topic. In example 3 . 59, the indirect object, Randall, has lost its
marking dae 'to, for' and been fronted to initial position in the sentence where it functions
as the topic for both clauses in the sentence.
3 . 59    Randall jakti         nane   mut-ena          a=va,     e/o=da=go         mut-esi.

          ' Randall I'd already given betelnut to, but you gave him (more) on top of (his due).'
In example 3 .60, i n which both clauses have only NPs with core functions, neither the
subject (A) nor the object (0) is marked in 3 .60a. But the object (0) in 3 .60b is marked by
ava 'that one contrastively' to contrast Boltin Yamboltin with the speaker, who is really the
addressee' s wife.

to the initial position in the clause. In example 3 .6 1 , the ningu 'needle' is fronted. It is not
marked for its instrumental function in its containing clause, because it is topicalised. The
demonstrative aimi 'with that one' indicates that it serves as a left-dislocated topicalised
instrument in the sentence.

         'The needle I use to weave string bags with that one, I am weaving (my)
        husband' s personal bag.'
The noun kambo ' house' is not marked as a locative argument with da in example 3 .62,
because it is relativised on and serves as the theme.
3 .62   Kambo evevetu         avi-raera            a=mo, mindafu =ri.
        house women. RED sleep-CUST.3PL.FN that=TIF big=COP.AQ
        ' That house where the women sleep is big. '
   Several words and expressions encoding temporal or manner notions are lexically fixed
as unmarked forms, but are still unambiguously interpreted as temporal or manner NPs with
oblique function. Many temporal and manner expressions that are marked have also been
lexicalised. In example 3 .63a oroko 'today' is an unmarked temporal word functioning as
an N P head, and sifode ' tomorrow' in 3 .63b is a PP that has lexicalised as a temporal
expression.
3 .63   a. Oroko    mind-aresa,     ai ?     b.   Sifo=de         mind-aresa,     ai ?

           ' Will you eat (it) today?'            ' Will you eat (it) tomorrow?
Examples 3 .64a and b illustrate expressions encoding manner that are unmarked and
marked respectively.
3 .64a. Nu tefo      OJ-Ira.
        3S nothing come.N DUR-TP.3S.FN
        ' He came without anything./He didn't come with any specific purpose in mind.

        3S speed=cEFF=CPAR come.NDUR-TP.3S.FN
        ' He came quickly. '
    Proper nouns encoding placenames also occur a s bare NPs, Even though Tuft i n example
3 .65 is a locative argument with oblique syntactic function, it is unmarked.
3 .65   Na Papilus 0 Selwyn Tu{i jo                 gae=ri.
        1 SG Papilus or Selwyn Tufi NEG not.see=COP.AQ

86    Chapter 3   In this section, A, S, and 0, as defined by Dixon, have been used to discuss gramm atical
functions. In Korafe, A and S realise one grammatical relation, subject, so henceforth s will
stand for this grammatical relation that includes both transitive and intransitive subjects.","[102, 103, 104, 105, 106]"
"
The 0-7S guideline (G-3) : 1 9
   The object N P in a marking clause predicated by a DS sequencing medial verb is
interpreted as the subject of the reference clause, provided that the reference clause is
predicated by a verb that agrees in person and number with this NP and contains no overt
core NP of its own.
   In example 6.70 the subject, nane 'it is 1 ' , and object, nunda beD ' her hair' , are identified
and maintained as subj ect and object in the second clause by the ss medial verb of the first
clause. But the medial verb in the second clause is marked for switch of subject, and the
object of clause 2 is interpreted as the subject of clause 3 .
6.70     . . . [nane      nunda beD bu-do] I        [ghauro joka=da
                I S .CEFF 3S .GEN hair get.I-SEQ.SS bamboo inside=LOC
18     There is an exception to this rule. When a perception verb (e.g. gido 'seeing', ningido 'hearing',
       jaredo ' despairing') predicates the initial clause in a clause sequence predicated by ss verbs, the
       subject NP for the series follows the perception verb. This NP functions as a thematic P2 argument or as
       the subject of the subsequent clause, marking the onset of the next TCCU.
19     The numbering of these guidelines follows the order set up in § 1 1 .2.4.4 where a more complete set of
       tracking guidelines are provided.
                                                                                             SRCs   213        fend-enoh                  [ir-ira·1 3

        ' . . . it was I that got her hair put it inside a bamboo stem, and it (the hair) remains.'
This rule applies both to clause sequences having realis verbs (6. 69) and to clause
sequences having irrealis verbs (6.70). In switch-reference involving a transfer predication,
the animate LOCUS may lose its indirect object marking (kena or dae) when it has core
function in another clause. (Refer to §4.4.4.) In fact, this animate recipient NP is more likely
to be understood as the 0 in the 0---7S switch than the inanimate obj ect (the obj ect
transferred). In example 6.7 1 , the animate object (addressee) natofo is understood as the
subject of the third clause, ningarera 'they will hear' .
6.7 1   ... [na y-a]J                    [natofo s-aonoh                  [ning-arerah ...

        ' . . .I will go and tell the kinfolk, and they will hear . . . '
   Cause-effect is often the semantic relationship between clauses with an 0---7S switch. In
the following example, the object of clause 1 , kaugha daba ava 'that same banana tree',
becomes the subject of the following two clauses. The boy ' s action of thrusting his entire
weight against the banana tree was enough to cause it to topple over.

8. 1 1 . 1 REPLACIVE OR INTERNALLY HEADED RELATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS
   Most Korafe relative clauses are internally headed. They relativise on core arguments or
on oblique arguments that are unmarked and fronted. The role the referent of the relativised
nominal plays in the independent base is commonly signalled by the demonstrative which
terminates the relative construction ? l
   In example 8 .7 1 , the nominal relativised on, gagara 'girl ' , is an internal constituent with
subject function in the initial clause.
8.71     [Gagara vare=da              a-ira                     a=mo, hHEME [nan=da
          girl         garden=LOC go.NDUR-TP .3S.FN that=T/F                       I S=GEN         komana=ri. ] RHEME
         friend=COP.AQ
         ' The girl who went to the garden is my friend.'
The demonstrative amo marks the relative clause as the theme, which provides the given
information on which the rest of the sentence is predicated.
   In 8 .72 the subject of the relative clause genembo 'man' is the noun relativised on. The
demonstrative aimi is the subject NP in the dominant clause. It refers anaphorically to the
relativised noun in the previous base.
8 .72    Genembo oka sifo+ghousa bambu-raira,                             aimi

         come.NDUR-position.at-TP.3S .FN
         ' The man (that) catches fish all the time, that one came. '
2l
        Keenan ( 1 985: 1 63- 1 65) tenns relative-like clause constructions that are phonologically distinct from
        the dominant clause (which has a pronoun that anaphorically refers to the nominal relativised on) 'co­
        relatives' . According to him, these dependent relative clauses in hypotactic relationship with the
        dominant clause ""are not NPS and thus afortiori not RCs on our defmition, but they are the functional
        equivalent of RCs in many languages"".
282      Chapter 8The demonstratives aimi and ava often are used to contrastively specify referents they mark
or refer to. Placing them in the dominant base underlines the contrastive nature of the
nominal they refer to. In this case, the man who is always catching fish is the person who
has just come in.
    Similarly, the ava in example 8.73a signals that the ghaka 'canoe' identified by the
relative clause is the one that got smashed. In this example, the ghaka ' canoe' relativised on
is an obj ect in the relative construction.
8.73a.     Ghaka bu-do             i-sera,             a=va       beji-muta.
           canoe geU-SEQ.SS gO.DUR-DP . I PL.FN that=CT break.I-YP.3S .FN
           'The canoe that we took, (it was) that one that broke. '
In 8.73b no contrast is present and the canoe is the given thematic constituent of the CRS.
The demonstrative amo terminates the relative clause and is phonologically bound to it.
8.73b.     Ghaka bu-do             i-sera              a=mo,       beji-muta.
           canoe geU-SEQ.SS go.DUR-DP. I PL.FN that=TIF break.l-YP.3S .FN
           ' Regarding the canoe that we took, it broke. '
   Core arguments relativised o n are not necessarily the initial constituent i n the relative
clause. In 8.74 the noun relativised on is boka ' loincloth'.
8.74     Aya         boka      seghe   dend-ira,              a    nanda=ri.
         mother loincloth wash.! hang.up.I-TP.3S.FN that I S .GEN=COP.AQ
         'The loincloth that mother washed and hung up is mine. (lit. Mother washed a
         loincloth and hung it up, that one is mine.)'
As the syntactic obj ect of the relative clause, boka is positioned as the second NP in the
clause. The a 'that' in the dominant base refers anaphorically to boka.
   In order to be relativised on, an oblique argument must shed its postpositional marking
and be obligatorily positioned initially in the relative construction. In 8.75 the referent of
the nominal ningu ' needle' has an instrumental semantic role in both clauses. In the relative
clause, it is unmarked and has pragmatic topic function. The determiner aimi marks it both
as an instrument in the event described and as the thematic base in the sentence.

    One oblique argument, the possessor, cannot be relativised on simply by fronting it. It
is followed by a possessive pronoun and then the rest of the relative clause. The NP
relativised on in 8 .76 is genembo eni 'a certain man' ; the possessive pronoun nunda follows
it.
8.76    Genembo eni            nunda      vide+jamena               etoto+naM       ir-iara

   Multiclausal relative constructions in Korafe are common. The relative construction in
example 8.77 is an SRC with two clauses. The NP genembo is relativised on. Overtly present
as the subject of the first clause, it is understood to be the referent of the object in the
second clause of base 1 and the referent of the subject in base 2.

8. 1 1 .2 RELATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS WITH ARA
   Another relative construction type begins with the demonstrative form arti 'that one that
you're focusing on, I mean the one that'. 13 The speaker uses ara to refer to elements in the
deictic context (gestural, symbolic, or in the conversation context) which he or she knows
that the addressee also recognises.
  When ara precedes the noun being relativised on, the speaker is telling the addressee
new information about the referent of the relativised noun. In example (8.78), the speaker
explains the use to which he put the stick lying nearby.","[301, 302, 303]"

4.4.4 TRANSFER AND SPEECH-ACT PREDICATIONS
   The concept of transfer inherently involves three entities: an agent making the
transferral, a patient, experiencer or an object-theme being transferred, and a goal to which
the entity is transferred. The agent is almost always human. Inanimate entities being
physically transferred are patients, animate entities transferred are experiencers, and speech
acts are object-themes. The goal must be mobile and often is an animate recipient.
   Although these three arguments potentially occur as core arguments, there is a strong
Korafe preference in iconically-ordered discourse to l imit clauses to two overt core
arguments or less. When the agent and patient are realised as overt NPs, the goal is often
expressed as an oblique argument, marked by the benefactive postposition dae (permanent
recipient), the approximate locative postposition kena (temporary recipient), or the locative
postposition da (inanimate location). When the goal is going to be functioning as a core
argument in the subsequent clause, it is not expressed as an oblique argument but as a core
argument with locus semantic function.
   Common transfer predicates are mutu 'give', se 'say' and ijuge 'teach'. In example 4.67,
only the agent and patient are present in the transfer clause. The goal of the transfer, which
in this case is an animate recipient, is not realised as an overt NP in the transfer clause, but
instead as the subject of the subsequent clause by marking on the verb.

          ' Or the white skins showed their good lifestyle to us, and we are seeing (it).'
In example 4.68, the focus is placed on mandi 'the boy', not as the goal of the transfer, but
as the agentive recipient. Thus, the NP mandi is overtly present as the syntactic subject and

All three arguments occur in the clause that encodes transfer in examples 4.69 and 4.70.
The goal of the transfer, mandi 'boy ' , is marked with kena and dae respectively, as an
oblique argument, with kena signalling a temporary loan and dae a more permanent
exchange.

    Speech-act verbs are transfer verbs with three basic arguments: the agentive speaker, the
object-theme utterance, and the addressee. Like other transfer predications, very rarely are
more than two N P arguments overtly present in a clause. In example 4.7 1 , only one NP
occurs. The addressee is referenced by a benefactive postpositional phrase in a tail
construction, following the clause with the speech act verb. The utterance actually follows
the clause with the speech act as a projection (see the introductory paragraph of §8.9). Note
that the initial speech�act verb i S is actually a nominal+verb combination, ategi+etira 'ask
(lit. question+she did); the speech act verb following the quotation is a form of the verb se
'say ' , which is commonly used to indicate speech acts.

       also used as speech act verbs preceding or following utterances in Korafe: divu 'sing', kate 'think' and
       ategi e 'greet, question' (used in example 4.7 1 ).

   The goal NP is given core argument function in transfer clauses in SRCs where its
referent is a salient participant realised as a core argument in subsequent clauses. When it is
assigned core status, it functions as a locus participatory argument and must precede the
patient or object-theme argument in the clause encoding transfer. In example 4.72, the
initial transfer clause has three unmarked arguments. The subject na ' I ' having agent
function occurs initially. The locus argument, ni 'you', precedes the patient argument, guri
asighae ' shell jewelry on a string' . This locus argument has subject function in the
subsequent clause.
4.72   [AGENT:     Na       LOCUS :    ni     PATIENT:       guri       asi=ghae

   Another example is given i n 4.73 . In 4.73a, the locus argument is realised by a
postpositional phrase marked the postposition kena 'to, toward (ALOC)' and given oblique
syntactic function. However, in 4.73b, because the locus argument is a core argument with
subject function in the subsequent clause, the NP realising it is placed in the initial P I
position and not marked by the ALOC postposition, i.e. treated as having core function in
the clause where it is overtly present.
4.73a. ALOC:    Genembo eni=kena PATIENT:              asi   mutu-raera.

   In sentences that contain a dependent clause or base in hypotactic relationship with an
independent clause or base, core arguments realised by overt NPs in the initial dependent
base may be ellipsed in the subsequent base. The initial clause encoding transfer in example
4.74a has three overt NPs as core constituents. Randall, the goal, and jakQ 'betelnut', the
patient, are participants in both clauses. Therefore, they precede the agent nane ' I (focal
actor)"" which only is an argument in the initial clause. In example 4.74a, Randall plays a
1 34   Chapter 4participatory locus role in both clauses. But in example 4.74b, Randall is marked by the
benefactive postposition dae as a circumstantial argument.
4.74a. [LOCUS : Randall       PATIENT: jaM           AGENT:     nane    mut-ena

       'I gave betelnut to Randall . '
   I n example 4.75, the initial speech act predication i s part o f a dependent sentence base. It
contains a locus argument and an agent argument; the speech act is not represented by an
independent nominal. The locus in the first base has the agentive participatory role in the
second independent sentence base. The second base also contains an object-theme which
references an utterance.
4.75   [0, LOCUS: na      AGENT: afa       se-do       ghu-sira                       a=moiaASE 1

     In the next two examples, the locus argument references an inanimate location. The
ghaka 'canoe' in example 4.76 is the location receiving the equipment in the initial clause.
It is ellipsed in the second clause where it is understood to be object of davuseri 'they
paddled' , having participatory patient role. Locus arguments promoted from locative
arguments obligatorily occur before patient or object-theme arguments that do not have a
role in subsequent clauses. In example 4.76a the locative argument, ghakada ' in the canoe' ,
i s the final overt N P i n its clause. The locus argument, ghaka etoto 'two canoes' i n 4.76b,
participates as a core argument in both clauses. It precedes the patient argument, which
does not play a role in the second clause.

   The unmarked locus, dengoro 'ear' in example 4.77 is the topical site into which the
tataru 'tortoise shell earrings' are inserted. The expression dengoro tataru farido ' insert
tortoise shell earrings in ear' refers to one step in the routine the Korafe engage in when
preparing for dancing. Like the previous example, the locus precedes the patient in the
clause where it occurs.

4.5 ARGUMENT ORDERS IN FULL PREDICATIONS
    The distribution and ordering of oblique arguments in full predications is based
primarily on pragmatic, rather than semantic or syntactic, criteria. That is why it appears, at
first glance, that any ordering of NPs is acceptable. Oblique arguments expressing temporal,
purpose (including benefactee-recipient), locative, approximate locative (including
temporary recipient), instrument, and manner notions 1 6 are interspersed with agent, patient,
and object-theme. Up to five arguments have been found in a clause.","[151, 152, 153, 154, 155]"
"                                             1 53
1 54   Chapter 5(3) The temporal relationships (i.e. sequencing and overlap relationships) between the
    verbs are not overtly expressed by their structure, as they are by the medial verbs in
    switch-reference constructions (SRCS).
(4) Only the terminal verb is inflected, but the scope of its inflection (which includes tense,
    aspect, mood, subject marking and speech-act value) extends over all the verbs in the
    series.
(5) All verbal constituents encode events in which at least one of the referents, usually the
    one realised as subj ect, is ' shared' . (The default value for subject referent for the series
    is assumed to be the one marked on the terminal verb.) In addition to its direct coding
    on the verb, the subject NP is sometimes referenced by an overt NP.
(6) Nominal + verb combinations (see §2.6) are regarded as a verbal unit, distributionally
    equivalent to single verb constituents of the SVC.
(7) Verbal constituents cannot be embedded by demonstratives and/or postpositions as a
    complement of another verb in the series.
(8) Modal particles (e.g. are, asi, la, (ano, ai), indicating the speaker' s outlook on an event,
    cannot follow bare verb stems.
(9) SVCs encode events. The term ' event' is used without a modifier to refer to ' conceptual
    event' throughout the rest of this work. According to Pawley ( 1 98 7 : 3 3 5-3 3 6),
    conceptual events are ""the meaning of a clause, containing . . . a kind of action,
    conceptually simple or complex."" ! It has been noted (Lord 1 974: 1 96- 1 97; Bradshaw
    1 982:28; Foley and Olson 1 985 : 1 8-22; Sebba 1 987:2 1 2; Givan 1 990b:23,48; Durie
    1 992:2) that each verb in an SVC can often be considered to express a subpart or aspect
    of a single overall event, which correlates closely with a complex or episodic event, as
    defined by Pawley ?
   Two basic structural types of SVCs can be distinguished in Korafe:3 ( 1 ) contiguous SVcs
and (2) non-contiguous SVcs. Contiguous SVcs minimally consist of an uninterrupted
sequence of two or more verbs. This contiguous set of verbs follows any nominals and       In his taxonomy of conceptual events, Pawley lists: ( I ) simple single actions, (2) episodic ""sequences
       of more or less separate acts"", or (3) complex events, which lie ""between simple and episodic events
       occupying various points on a scale of complexity"". Examples of simple events given by Pawley are:
       Bill released the -rope; John winked; Mary gave me a slap in the lace. The following sentences
       exemplify episodic events: Mary painted a landscape; Bill built his own house. These examples from
       Pawley typify complex events: Bill hit a bal/ through the window; Fido is letching his stick; Mary 's
       words made me angry.
          Pawley also lists generic events and events specified for temporal and spatial settings in his
       taxonomy.
2
       Pawley (personal communication) notes that an event does not necessarily have an objective unity
       outside of the speaker's decision to depict it as such.
3      Foley and Olson ( 1 985:57) and Lane and Pawley ( 1 992:4) have also documented a binary split
       between more closely-knit and more loosely-knit SVcs. Foley and Olson defme ( I ) nuclear and (2)
       core serialisation of predicates in svcs, based on a layered conceptualisation of clause structure.
       Predicates joined at the nuclear layer are juxtaposed. They share all arguments as well as tense,
       polarity, modality, mood, and illocutionary force and must be under one intonational contour.
       Predicates joined at the core level also share all peripheral arguments, tense, polarity, modality, mood,
       and illocutionary force, but they share only one core argument, which may intervene between verbal
       constituents.
          Pawley and Lane differentiate two SVC types for Kalam: simple SVCS and multiscene SVCs.
                                                                                    SVCs    1 55modifiers present in the construction. Non-contiguous SVcs allow nominals and modifiers
to intervene between any two verbs in an SVC.
  The term ' serial verb sequence ' (SVs) is also used to refer to the sequence of verbs,
whether contiguous or not, as opposed to the entire SVC.
   The main questions that attach to the analysis of SVCS in Korafe (and other languages)
are : ( 1 ) are some or all SVCS analysed as a single clause, as a reduced clause sequence, or
something different from the notions, clause or clause sequence? (2) Are SVSs not only
single predicates (if the single clause analysis is chosen), but single lexemes? (3) If entered
in the dictionary, how do we describe the role assignment of SVcs? These questions will be
taken up in detail in a later section.","[173, 174, 175]"

                                           CHAPTER S
                         SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS (SVCs)   Whereas the previous chapter concentrated on sentences with one predicate, this chapter
and Chapters 6, 7 and 8 describe sentences which contain multiple predicates. There are
two types of multipredicate constructions: chaining and co-ranking. Chaining constructions
combine verbal predicates with different levels of finiteness. Co-ranking sentences combine
structures that terminate with verbal predicates having the same level of finiteness and/or
non-verbal predicates.
   This chapter details the properties and functions of serial verb chaining constructions
(svcs). SVcs have been described (Longacre 1 98 5 : 23 9) as a ""derivative type"" chaining
structure, in which all the non-terminal verbs are ""stripped down"" to stem forms, the
terminal verb being the only inflected verb in the series. Examples 5 . 1 and 5 . 2 illustrate
some Korafe SVcs. In example 5 . 1 , the terminal verb yasi 'go' has an imperative final form.
The other two verbs sumbu ' run' and vosi 'descend' are bare stem forms. The subject for all
three verbs is understood to be the addressee.
5.1    Sumbu vosi+y-asi!
       run.I   descend. I+gO.DUR.IMP-that.say.II
       ' Go down on the double! (lit. Running, descending, go!)'
Example 5 . 2 contains two SVcs. The first SVC, in the first line, terminates with a medial
verb form, buvudo ' it arrived and' . The second SVC on the third line terminates with a
sequence of four verbs which encode a complex event, namely the demolition of a house. It
terminates with a [mal verb.

       foundations) and that house fell, hit the ground, and disintegrated (into the
       wreckage that) lay (there).'
The following properties are common to all Korafe SVCs:
( 1 ) They contain a series of two or more verbs.
(2) The verbs are ordered iconically, reflecting the order of the events they refer to, or, at
    least, the speaker' s perception of the order of events.","[171, 172, 173]"
"
9.2. 1 FIXED AND SEMIPRODUCTIVE SPEECH FORMULAS
   Fixed speech formulas (formulas that do not vary in lexical content or word order) in
Korafe are exemplified by the greeting Sifo eveva! 'Good day ! (lit. day good)' , a calque on
the English expression. Fixed formulas used for expressing gratitude are: A iyakoe!
'Thanks ! ' and A iyakoe bekti resena! ' Thank you very much! ' . The telling of a legend
begins with the fixed formula Kiki! ' Story ! ' and Kiki aghata bamba! 'tall tale ! ' concludes
them.
   Semiproductive formulas occurring with severe constraints on the variation include both
traditional greetings and farewells in Korafe. Some common greetings are given in 9. 1 3 .
9. 1 3   a. R-av-asi!             b.   Ir-esa!                 c.   Re-f-esa!
            IPF-sleep-NP.2S.AQ         remain-PRES.2S .FN           JPF-come-PRES.2S.FN
            ' You slept ! '            ' You are staying! '         ' You are coming ! '
Only second person forms are used in these greetings. They are statements, not questions or
commands, that must occur with near past tense for ravasi! 'you slept' and present tense for
the other forms. In addition to their discourse function as a greeting, they often signal the
initial discourse utterance or the initial response in a dialogue. Movements, such as the third
greeting encodes, can be SVSs encoding direction + motion, such as: Viti refesa! ' You are
coming up.' and Sembu refesa! ' You are coming across (the surface crossed is usually the
fiord)' .
  Farewells are also standardised. However, they are not statements, l iterally, but
commands. The most common farewells are:
9. 1 4   a. Anumbe-y-o!             b. Yasi-y-o!                 c. Avi-y-o!
            sit.IMP-EPEN-STEN          gO.lMP-EPEN-STEN             sleep .IMP-EPEN-STEN
            ' Sit! '                   'Go ! '                      ' Sleep ! '
         d. I            av-ase!
            go.DUR.IMP sleep-H.2S.CR
            ' Go get some sleep! '
These expressions also comprise verbs, i n this case inflected for imperative mood or verb
sequences with V I inflected for imperative and V 2 for hortative moods (see 9. 1 4d above).
All the verbs have the second person singular subject suffix. Those that terminate in -0 are
uttered at a greater amplitude than most conversational exchanges are. As with the
greetings, directional verbs can be juxtaposed with the short form of the command: Vosiyo!
(vose +iyo) ' Go down! ' and Sembiyo! (sembu+iyo) 'Go across ! '
                                                               Standardised verb sequences and TCCUs          3019.2.2 STANDARDISED CLAUSE SEQUENCES
   Standardised clause sequences used in SRCs are among the productive speech formulas
that occur in Korafe. These speech formulas denote conventional activities or grammatical
notions, such as iterative aspect or conative mood. lo They are the primary focus of this
section. They have the general structure:
       C LA U SE I : (x) V I=SSIDS + C LA U SE2 : (x) V2=INFLECTED VERB
where X stands for unspecified non-verbal material and V I is expounded by a medial verb
                                                                       II
form and V 2 by an inflected verb form, either medial or final. (Constraints on the
occurrence of (x) are given below and further discussed in §9 .2.2.2.)
   These standardised clause sequences are more closely integrated than other sequences
involving medial verbs. In addition to obeying all the restrictions that apply to SRCs, such
as tense-sequencing constraints, they are constrained by grammatical and phonological
rules which apply obligatorily to them, but optionally to other sequences involving medial
verbs. These rules include:
( 1 ) the entire sequence must be negated as a unit. If only one of the events represented is
      negated, the initial verb must be changed to a final verb, and the SRC must become a
      co-ranking structure (CRS). (See §9.2.2. 1 .)
(2) The initial clause often manifests tokens of (x) before V I . Normally, nothing intervenes
    between V I and V 2 in C I and C 2 respectively. However, sometimes tokens of (x) do
    intervene between V I and V 2 in sequences encoding generic cause-effect, change of
    location or state, transfer and the inchoative aspect. Examples of exceptional cases are
    discussed in §9.2.2.2.
(3) The entire sequence must be associated with one rhythm unit and often is associated
    with one intonation contour.","[320, 321]"
"       ' I was born, grew up and became big.'
The subject NP, nunda lama, has the patient role in example 4.37.
4.37   ... a vasa ingaga=kena y-arira,                      nun=da lama ingaga+arira.
            or place black=ALOC go.DUR F.3S.FN 3S=GEN body black+do.F.3S.FN

Unlike one-place predicates with agentive role, one-place predicates with experiencer or
patient roles cannot have imperative forms. Thus, the following commands are ill-formed:
*Baji! 'Grow! ' or *Tama ingaga e! ' Body, become black! '
   Korafe has numerous one-place predicates with experiencer or patient subject arguments
that conflate existence with manner, manner with motion, and motion with figure. Among
the one-place predicates that conflate manner with existence are: desega e 'be leaning
against', larighe ' flash (suddenly)"" liritaraghe 'sparkle (like a diamond)"" firirifararaghe
'spatter sideways, explode outwards because of being heated', afe ' stink', and feeghe ' be
afloat, be buoyant' . Some that conflate manner with motion are: rase ' sink', sive ' float
away', liralara e ' ripple, slosh', asege 'to be forcibly snapped off leaving a jagged edge' ,
seririghe ' (objects) slide o r slip through ( a medium, a n entity' s grasp)' , jerighe ' go
aground, get beached' and jeririghe 'slide on slippery surface' . Some predicates conflating
motion with figure are: gafe ' (tree, upright figure) topple over', babaku(babaka)mbe ' (tide)
1 20      Chapter 4crest covering reef and high water mark on land', boinghe (figure suspended from one
point) swing', and buinghe (figure suspended from two points) swing. In example 4.38, the
bendoro 'kwila tree' is the patient subject of the verb gofe.
4.3 8      ... bendoro         gofe-do          ir-ira ...
                kwila.trees topple.I-SEQ.SS remain-PRES.3S.FN
           ' . . . kwila trees have toppled over and are remaining (lying in that state) . . . '
    Some one-place predicates encode the production of sounds: jinjanghe 'chirp (as
crickets do)' , boku(boku/baku)ghe6 ' make a swishing or gurgling sound' , kinkanghe
'tinkle', bonbonghe 'make loud cracking sound' .
   One-place motion with manner o r direction predicates having either an agentive subject
or a patientiexperiencer subject are discussed below in §4. 3 .2.
   As mentioned in §4. 1 .2, one-place predicates with experiencer or patient subjects are
evidenced by a number of ambi-transitive verbs. For instance, in example 4.39a, the verbs
du ' fall', de 'hit ground' and beje 'break in pieces' all have an intransitive reading. But in
4.39b, the verb beje 'break in pieces' is transitive, having both an object ainda sena ava ' its
shell' and a subject, which is the first person plural subject co-referenced on the verb
vegeoro 'sand down ' .
       INTRANSITIVE-PATIENT SUBJECT (one-place):
4.39a. Usu      agha       du de                  be;e-tira.

           until it goes and becomes white . . . '
6       Many examples of manner + existence/motion, sound + existence/motion verbs in Korafe have a single
        stem form that gives one occurrence of the event, a reduplicated form that encodes several occurrences
        of the same event performed by entities moving in the same direction, and a rhyming reduplicated form
        gives several occurrences of the same event performed by entities moving helter skelter. An example is:
        bokughe ' (fish, etc.) make a swishing or gurgling noise in water', bokubokughe '(water) make a
        swishing or gurgling sound repeatedly as it goes down a pipe' , and bokubakaghe ' (waves) make a
        crashing sound' .
                                                 Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences   1214.3.2 ONE-PLACE PREDICATES WITH SUBJECT HAVING AGENT O R FORCE ROLE
   Some intransitive active one-place predicates encode activities performed by an agent:
jangute 'relax' and tumbe 'refuse to speak, be silent' . The posture verbs jete ' stand up,
wait', ere 'arise' , jasa e ' lie down' and anumbe 'sit down' occur with agentive subjects.
        AGENT:
4.40    Veka,       nangae buvu           fgE.     ;angut-aore!
        seedling l .COM.D go.out.! stand.! relax-H. I PL.CR
        ' Friend, let's get out (of the dancing line) and stand and relax ! '
   Most verbs encoding motion o r conflating manner with motion and direction with
motion are also one-place predicates. A few of those that encode manner with motion occur
only with an agentive subject. These include: jorughe 'hop, leap horizontally' , jaunghe
'jump vertically', and deinghe 'walk, travel around' . The agent ofjorujorughedo ' it hopped
and hopped' in example 4.41 is egi amo 'that wallaby' .
4.4 1   ... egi     amo       ;oru;oru=ghe-do           ghu-r-urari

        man          see.l-SEQ.SS
        ' ...while that wallaby continues hopping along, the man will see it. . . '
   Most one-place predicates encoding motion with either manner or direction may occur
with two distinct one-place role frames: ( 1 ) an agentive or force subject or (2) a patient or
experiencer subject. These include: vose 'descend', viti 'ascend' , tere 'enter, move inside',
sumbu 'run' and buvu 'come out, exit, seep out, arrive' . In example 4.42a, ororo 'blood' is
the patient subject being relocated, but in 4.42b, sasingu noide 'the children with their
mother' are the agentive subject that are co-referenced on the verb buveri 'they arrived'.
        PATIENT SUBJECT:
4.42a . ... nanda ata iseri+e-vu,             ororo buv-ari
            I S.GEN foot slit+do.l-IMP.2PL.AQ blood come.out-SEQ.IR.3S.DS

        buv-eri.
        arrive.I-TP.3PL.AQ
        'The children and their mother went and arrived at (their) village.'
   Predicates encoding motion occur quite frequently with a locative oblique component,
such as the location natida 'at the village' in 4.42b. The motion verb i ' go' is semantically
oriented either to a goal or to the addressee. The motion verb ju 'come' is oriented toward
1 22   Chapter 4the speaker. These orientations are evident in the following formulaic greeting (4.43) and
response (4.44).
       SPEAKER starting to move away from addressee says:
4.43   Na re-f-ena.
       I S IPF-come.DUR-PRES. 1 S.FN
       ' I ' m on my way. (lit. I'm coming.)'
       CHILD responding to mother's call says:
4.44   Na er-en=are.
       I S IPF-go.PRES. 1 S.FN=that.CR
       ' I ' m right at this present moment moving that (your) way.
       (lit. I ' m going there right now.)'
   As mentioned in §4. 1 .2, one-place predicates with agentive subject are exhibited by a
number of ambitransitive verbs. In example (4.45a), the verb Junge 'hide' is used as a one­
place predicate with an agent subject and in (4.45b) as a two-place predicate with an agent
subject and a patient object.
4.45a. Nangae taima+beka eminda                  junge-do        g-arera.

       ' . . . a man . . . got that package again and hid it in that very same place.'
       (Matthew 1 3 :44)
4.4 ACTIVE TWO-PLACE PREDICATIONS
   A number of verbal predicates require two core or participatory semantic arguments in
their core role frame. By core role frame is meant the set of participatory roles mother­
tongue speakers automatically associate with the verbal predicate. However, the set of such
roles for a given verb is not immediately accessible to the non-mother-tongue speaking
analyst. Not only are there ambitransitive verbs with two distinct role frames, but the
Korafe often promote a benefactive or locative argument to locus role, an operation which
potentially yields three unmarked participatory arguments overtly occurring with the
predicate. The difficulties in identifying the underlying set of participatory roles for a
predicate are increased by the Korafe preference for ellipsing NP arguments that are
recoverable. NP arguments in sentences that mirror the iconic order of events are often
ellipsed when their referents are identifiable anaphorically, deictically from the social
context of the utterance, or culturally from the language group's prototypical conception of
the event encoded by the predicate.
  Nevertheless, it is clear that there are four types of two-place predications: predications
encoding change of position or state, perceptions, impersonal experiential predications, and
                                                 Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences         1 23transfer predications. Predications realising these semantic notions are described in the
following sections along with shifts in valency that occur. Other than the impersonal
predications, two-place predications manifest S O y order as their default syntactic
configuration.","[139, 140, 141, 142, 143]"

6.2.4 CONJOINING IN SRCs
   SRCS are ordered tense-iconically, whereas co-ranking structures are ordered logically
and are not necessarily tense-iconic. The sequence of verbs in SRCs is intended to be
isomorphic with the sequence of events in the real world that they encode. Co-ranking
                                                                                      SRCs     1 97structures relate one proposition to another using rhetorical parameters, e.g. cause-effect
relationships, result-reason relationships, and implicational conditions under which
propositions hold.
   In SRCs each clause, other than an initial recapitulated clause, provides new information.
The initial SRC clause, which is the head clause in a tail-head recapitulation, is the only SRC
clause that is given. The coordinating relationship between two SRC clauses is tense-iconic,
hence asymmetrical . B cannot precede A; therefore A+B does not equal B+A . But paratactic
co-ranking constructions, encoding alternation or additive relationships, allow either A+B or
B+A; both are equivalent. And hypotactic co-ranking constructions maintain a number of
relationships between A and B, but A is usually given, generic, or assumed to be given for
the sake of asserting B .
    SRC clauses terminated b y medial verbs are normally juxtaposed. Example 6 . 3 3
illustrates juxtaposition o f S S clauses [clauses 4 and 5], DS clauses [clauses 2 and 3 ] , and os
with SS [clauses 3 and 4 ] .

       ' They went, chopped (the sago tree), it fell, and the two brothers-in-law cut it off
       from the base, got a pointed stick, stripped off the bark, and it lay (there).
   S ince asymmetrical coordination is maintained by medial verb suffixes, medial
constructions do not require other linking devices. Nevertheless, Korafe S R Cs do
occasionally occur with conjunctions. They either suspend iconic ordering between the
conjoined clauses to allow order reversals A+B=B+A or alternative choices or they make
explicit cause-effect and temporal relationships between the conj oined clauses. The
conjunctive relationship only applies to the two conjoined clauses.
   Three conj unctions 0 ' or ' , ii 'and', and kotugo ' and likewise (lit. like a footprint)'
suspend iconic ordering between parallel constructions. Iconic ordering is resumed after the
second clause . The use of the conj unction 0 'or' joins two medial clauses that are
alternatives. In example 6.34, the two SS simultaneous medial verbs: gafuse ' while cutting'
andjetise 'while chopping' are given as equivalent alternatives.

Usually, conj unction o f medial clauses b y ii involves two simultaneous medial verb forms.
The conj unction permits free reversal of the conjoined pair of clauses. In the following
1 98   Chapter 6
example, two DS simultaneous medial verbs are conjoined by Q. Both verbs refer to the
same event, marriage, but evetu fifitero ' while they were marrying women' and vai ero
' while they were marrying men' present the event respectively from male and female
perspectives.
6.35   ... kirumo+u-se,
           feast+do.II-SIM.SS
       while they were feasting, and
       evetu fifit-ero             Q   vai+ero,
       woman put.II-SIM.R.3PL . DS and (woman)marry+do. sIM.R.3PL . DS

       Noah climbed into his boat.
       , . . . while they were feasting, and while men were marrying women and
       (women) were marrying, Noah climbed into his boat.'
In example 6.36, a clause with a os simultaneous medial verb is conjoined by kotugo 'and
likewise (lit. like a footprint) ' with a clause having a final verb. Here, the speaker uses
kotugo to underline his right to plant gardens on the land his uncles are using.
6.36   Aya-mane=da   enda          ebe-mane govu-roro              kotu=go

       'As for (my) mother's land, my uncles will be planting it, and likewise, I also
       will plant it. '
    Four temporal connective combinations: ainda gitida 'before that', ainghae dabade 'at
the same time as (lit. with that together)"" ainda jokada 'in the midst of that', and ainda
amboda ' after that', specify precisely the temporal link between clauses in S RCs. These
connective combinations are usually SRC-internal, l inked to the rhythm group of the
previous clause, with a pause following them. Normally SRCs track events in iconic order,
but the combination ainda gitida 'before that' interrupts the sequential temporal flow to
express a sequence of events that is ' out-of-order' . Example 6.23 in the previous section
illustrates how this device operates. So does example 6.37, which is from the the Biblical
account about Noah and the flood. In order for the clause encoding the flood's arrival to
precede the clause indicating Noah's embarking, it must be negated.
6.37   Usegha Q   glSI       jo fu-r-ae               lr-lr/

       while they were socialising and feasting . . . Noah went up into his boat.'
   Both the temporal connective combinations ainghae dabade ' and immediately (together
with that)' and ainda jokcida ' in the midst of that' fol low clauses predicated by
simultaneous medial verb forms. In addition to the notion of partial overlap encoded by the
verbs themselves, the connective ainghae dabade indicates that the event encoded by the
clause following it is to be considered as closely synchronised with the event encoded by
the clause that precedes it. In example 6.38, ainghae dabade indicates the cock's crow is
synchronised with the arrival of the snake.
6.38   . . . kokora s-iri                ainghae           dabade.

       , . . . while the cock was crowing, at that very same time, a snake that we call
       'tree snake' , that one came and got itself caught in Lucas' net. '
The clause preceding ainda jokdda ' in the midst of that' envelopes the clause following it
within its time span. In example 6.39, ainda jokcida ' in the midst of that' indicates that the
point at which the Epaulette shark gets caught in the net occurs within the longer period in
which many fish get caught in the net.

200      Chapter 6
   The temporal connective ainda amboda ' after that' specifies the significant events
involved in a temporal sequencing relationship between two clauses. In example 6.40, the
hollowing of the canoe is completed, then the next important phase-gathering the lashing
supplies together-<:an eventuate.
6.40     Agh-eoro                   dadab-eari              ainda         ambo=da.

         ' We hollow out (the canoe) until (the process) is finished, and after that, we

   Three conj unctions or conjunctive combinations specify a causal relationship between
                                                  3
the SRC clauses they linle They are: gido ' so', 1 aindae 'on account of that and therefore',
aindae sedo ' speaking on account of that'. The verb gido may be used in an SRC to refer to
an actual visual perception ' seeing' or as an enabling causal connective ' so ' . In the context
of example 6.4 1 , the first gido expresses a causal relationship between the wife's giving the
afterbirth and her husband' s reception of it. The husband does not really ' see' the afterbirth
until the second gido.

         her husband received (it), saw (it), was afraid and gave (it to the dog), and the dog
         ate (it).'
In the following example, gido 'so' indicates an enabling causal relationship between the
cessation of the protagonist's fright and his movement toward the net, in which a snake was
trapped .
6.42     ... oju dadabe-tiri            gido,       seka-go  ungo         sirege-tiri

13      The conjunctions aindae sedo and gido are actually connective clauses, because sedo 'saying' and
        gido 'seeing' are SS medial verbs that predicate clauses in SRCs. These Korafe conjunctions
        correspond closely to the description of conjunction formation, in which an uninflected or minimally
        inflected verb (e.g. 'do', 'say, 'see') is used or combined with a demonstrative stem (Thompson and
        Longacre 1985 :227).
                                                                                                  SRCs        201        vose-tiri,                   voto ruvi =da          bu-do ...

        ' . . . (his) fright was over, so he again stretched out his arm and it went
        down and he grabbed the net at its top edge . . . '
   Korafe SRCs follow regular cultural scripts, tending to list in rather minute detail the
component events in immediate order of occurrence (i.e. jitiri vosetira ' he put it and it went
down' , avaraka usetiri avira ' she blew up the fire and it caught and burned'). The causal
conj unctions, aindae 'on account of that' and aindae sedo 'speaking on account of that',
and the temporal conjunctions, ainda jokdda ' during that time' and ainda amboda 'after
that' , do not break iconic ordering. But they allow the speaker to suspend the immediate
event sequencing implicit in SRCS, leaving a whole series of events unspecified, so that the
focus may be placed on those events that are significant to the plot of the story. The
conjunction overtly indicates this omission to the addressee.
   The significant events marked by aindae ' on account of that' in the mourning customs
explained in example 6.43 include: ( 1 ) the death of brothers, (2) the mourning rituals, and
(3) the concocting of a poison to be used in sorcery. Other events, inconsequential to the
plot, may happen in between these events are, but they are skipped over here.

        'Brothers die, therefore (their relatives) are vexed, therefore they roast
        poison-producing things and the poisonous substance comes into being.'
   The sedo is added to aindae in the connective clause aindae sedo ' speaking on account
of that' to indicate to the addressee that the speaker has private knowledge of an event that
he or she is herewith revealing. In example 6.44, the speaker is announcing her pregnancy
to her husband. Again, she may have performed many other activities between her
perception of her pregnancy and the production of mats and string bags, but she omits
mentioning them.

       The Korafe for the customary os medial verbs in this sentence was originally written as
       ambearo. . . borearo. It arose from an earlier form ambeaoro. . . boreaoro, but the current generation of
       Korafe speakers do not allow three different vowels to be j uxtaposed. So the transcription was
       regularised to the more widely used forms ambeoro. .. boreoro.

       'I'm experiencing a response in my body, therefore I am getting (the
       materials) and preparing a pandanus leaf mat and a string bag for a baby.'
   A final dependent verb precedes aindae ' on account of that' in example 6.45a, but a
medial verb precedes aindae in 6.45b. The structural difference encodes a significant
semantic distinction. Both 6.45a and 6.45b detail some events that occurred in a battle the
Korafe had with the Okena. However, 6.45a is focused on providing the reason the Okena
beat such a hasty retreat, namely that the Korafe war party speared one of their number.
The temporal and referential relationships between garusera 'they speared' and oju edo
'they were afraid' are not made explicit in the structure. It i s quite possible that the
response of fear immediately followed the action of spearing.

       ' Because we speared (a man), the enemy were afraid, left and ran away.'
The use of aindae in 6 . 45 b suggests t o the readers that the fear response does not
immediately follow the spearing of the man. Several events have been skipped over in this
narration of the tale to focus on the significant events in cause-effect relationship, at least
from the author' s viewpoint. Both the temporal (sequencing) and the referential (0 S
following) relationships are made explicit in 6.45b.
6.45b. Gae-tero                 aindae          oju+e-do             do    sufu-seri.

6.2.5 GAPPING
   When two or more clauses have parallel constructions in Korafe, medial verbs may be
gapped. For example, where two clauses have the structure [s O/LOC v] and [s OILOC v] and
the NPs manifesting s and O/LOC in both clauses semantically encode equal and opposite
partner-participants, the medial verb of the first clause 1 5 may be gapped.","[216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222]"
"
3 .2.3.3 OTHER MORPHOLOGICAL MARKERS OF PRAGMATIC CONSTITUENTS
   The following morphological markers also indicate pragmatic constituents: ( 1 ) current
relevancy markers and ani, (2) modal thematic markers (asi and ta), (3) personal pronouns
including focal actor pronominal set, (4) interrogative pronouns and other forms, and (5)
contrastive specifiers (jo and nu).
   The current relevancy marker re 'here is, currently in focus' marks THEME NPs, given
information the speaker assumes is ""already activated"" (Chafe 1 976:30) in the mind of the
addressee. The noun phrases or noun clauses marked by re are part of the gestural or
symbolic deictic context of the speech act, as illustrated in 3 . 1 3 8 .
3 . 1 3 8 Dudley=re,          a=ni         buva=ghae, a=vo=ri.
          Dudley=COP.here that=COP.there scar=COM.D that=CT=COP.AQ
          ' Dudley here (you want to know which of the twins is Dudley), he' s that
          one with the scar, that one.'
   The modal markers asi ' that certainly was said (reported speech) ' and ta 'unexpectedly,
frustratingly' follow final verbs. They also mark THEME NPs, as shown in examples 3 . 1 39
and 3 . 1 40.
3 . 1 39 Father=masi,              bagia+kato=ri.
         Father=T/F.that.sayJI thief+repeated.doer=coP.AQ
         ' Father, they certainly say, is a thief.'
3 . 1 40 A =mo=ta,        ir-ira                  a=mo!
         that=T/F=FRUS remain-PRES.3S.FN that=TIF
         ' There, you ninny, it' s right over there (near you) ! '
1 08    Chapler 3   Personal pronouns signal contrast, marking the referential animate NP as the significant
one in a set. Two sets of pronouns have pragmatic FOCUS function: ( 1 ) the exclusive focal
actor set with -ne and the (2) exclusive focal experiencer set with -mo+a. Like { imi} , the
exclusive focal actor personal pronoun set (nane ' I myself, nine 'you, yourself , nune 'he
himself , and nene ' they themselves') marks its referent as the specific initiator of the
action encoded by the verbal predicate. However, unlike { im i } , this set is restricted to
clause-internal function, as syntactic subject, semantic AGENT, and pragmatic FOCUS. This
set must be used when a personal pronoun has subject function in an osv-ordered clause.
Therefore, example 3 . 1 4 1 b is ill-formed.
3 . 1 4 1 a. Na nune        de-lira.              b.   *Na nu de-tira.
             I S 3S.ACT hiu-TP.3S.FN                      I S 3S hit. l-TP.3S.FN
             ' It was he that hit me. '                * ' 1 he hit. '
This set indicates the focal actor in both transitive (3. 1 4 1 ) and intransitive (3 . 1 42) clauses.
3 . 1 42 Randall nune        i-sira.
         Randall 3S.ACT go. DUR-DP.3S.FN
         ' It was Randall himself that went. (He'll represent us well.)'
The pronominal referent undergoing some action can be singled out by adding mo+a to the
pronominal root forms, as illustrated by namoa 'me myself in example 3 . 1 43 .
3 . 1 43 Nu na=mo=a de-lira.
         3S I S=TIF=that hit.I-TP.3S.FN
         ' It was me that he hit! '
   I nterrogative p ronouns and other interrogative forms have FOC U S function in
clauses or sentence bases, drawing the accent of the intonation contour to their inherently
stressed syllable, as examples 4. 1 04 and 4. 1 05 illustrate.
   The negation marker jo ' not' is a contrastive specifier that immediately precedes the
focused constituent in the clause or takes the accent in the intonation contour and is itself
the focused constituent. Its function and distribution are detailed more fully in §4.6.
   When the contrastive specifier n ll occurs as THEME, it signals the topic for discussion
that the speaker is selecting out of a range of possible topics, as in example 3 .98 above.
When nu follows the TOPIC in a clause that is part of the initial base in a sentence, it marks
that base as the one contrastively focused on. In example 3 . 1 44, the speaker is correcting a
misapprehension of the addressee, by marking the event he knows occurred, contrasting it
with the non-event which he believes the addressee thinks occurred.
3 . 1 44 Nu nu kambo=da a-ira,                             a=va=ta            vikoko

       NEG get.I-not.do=coP.AQ
        ' He did go to the house (it' s true), but he didn't get the bush knife.'
   This specifier is further discussed in § 8 . 1 2.
                                                  CHAPTER 4
               CLAUSES, PREDICATES, PREDICATIONS AND SENTENCES4. 1 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
   This chapter surveys Korafe clauses/predications and briefly outlines the structure and
intonation patterns of simple sentences.
   Clauses roughly correspond to the semantic notion of full predications, i.e. predications
with both participatory and circumstantial semantic arguments. The predication types
detailed in the following sections are based on the correspondence between the number of
core arguments that can occur and the semantic roles these arguments play. Predication
types in Korafe are either stative or active. Non-verbal clauses and clauses with iri ' remain'
express states of affairs. Other verbal predicates express events, the verb stem being an
""event classifier: a verb stem denoting a kind of action [or process] , conceptually simple or
complex"" (Pawley 1 987:33 5-3 36).
   Simple sentences have two basic components: a base with accompanying prosodies.
Because the base of a simple sentence corresponds syntactically to a clause and
semantically to a predication, predication types are presented first in the fol lowing
discussion. The simple sentences surveyed in the final section of this chapter are:
statements, content questions, polar questions, and commands.","[127, 128, 129]"

9.3 THEMATIC CLAUSE-CHAIN UNITS (TCCUS)
   Pawley and Syder ( 1 98 3 : 1 9 1 ) examine two linguistic capacities that are at the beck and
call of a mother-tongue speaker: native like selection and nativelike fluency. Beyond
knowing the grammatically correct sentence strings, a mother-tongue speaker also knows
which of those strings are natural and which are marked and uses them appropriately. Not
                                                               Standardised verb sequences and TCCUs         325only that, but the speaker is able to produce partly novel strings in pause-free fluent chunks
with up to ten words. Pawley and Syder ( 1 983 :202) term these chunks ' fluent units' . 1 8
   Chafe ( 1 986:2 1 7, 1 987:22ff.) identifies a similar unit, which h e terms an ' intonation
unit ' . This unit contains a sequence of about five or six word words combined under a
single, coherent intonation contour and usually preceded by a pause. Intonation units
contain information that is ""activated"" and in the speake r ' s current focus of
consciousness. 1 9
   The Korafe version of such units is called here a thematic clause chain unit (TCCU).
TCCUs may consist of (a) one or more NPS/PPS, (b) a clause, or (c) a string of clauses. It is
the multiclausal character of so many of these units in Korafe that led to the name adopted
here, which focuses on the difference between English ' fluent units' and a significant
number of these Korafe units. 2° All T C C Us are defined by semantic and phonological
criteria. Multiclausal TCCUs are also defined by specific grammatical criteria.
     Let us examine in more detail the features of TCCUS.
( 1 ) Each TCCU is a thematic unit. It focuses on a certain limited amount of information, a
cluster of events that are held together semantically by a common theme. This is illustrated
by the thematic units (labelled ' Unit' in the examples in this section) in example 9.72.
9.72
Unit 1 :
           Kamuse-do,
           card.I-SEQ.SS
           , We will card the (inner bark of the songa vine) into strips,
18    Pawley and Syder define 'fluent unit' as ""a technical term to refer to a stretch of pause-free speech
      uttered at or faster than normal rate of articulation-about five syllables per second in English"". They
      claim that ""the largest unit of novel discourse that can be fully encoded in one encoding operation is a
      single clause of eight to ten words... fluent talkers regularly pause or slow down at the end of each clause
      of four to ten words ... ""
19    Chafe says that information is presented at the rate of ""one new concept per intonation unit. He posits
      three activation states for concepts: ""active,"" ""semiactive"", and ""inactive"". An active concept is currently
      in ""a person's focus of consciousness"". A semiactive concept is ""one that is in a person's peripheral
      consciousness, a concept of which a person has a background awareness"". Inactive concepts are
      concepts that are ""currently in a person's long-term memory"" but not in his or her current awareness.
20    Other researchers have noted the existence of clause sequences that function as coherent units in
      chaining structures. In his chapter on clause chaining and hierarchical structures, Longacre ( 1 972:26-50)
      draws on the field notes of several linguists studying Papuan languages to give examples of breakdowns
      of SRCs into multiclausal build-up units (au).
          Olson ( 1 98 1 :286, 300-306) describes four thematic topic marker suffixes (-ga, -moga, -koga and
      -gana) that interact with the switch-reference system ofBarai.
          Woodbury ( 1 983 :299-300) discusses units of rhetorical structure that interact with the syntactic
      switch-reference inflectional system in Central Yup' ik Eskimo. His unit termed ' LI NE' bounded by
      pauses resembles the phonological defmition of TCCUS.

           we will coil the (dried) pandanus leaves, put them away (where) they will
           remain, and

           them, and

           beginning+do.J-SEQ.SS weave.I-F . l PL.FN
           we will begin to weave the mat. '
The first unit recapitulates the final verb of the previous sentence, maintaining temporal
continuity between the two SRCs involved. The focus of unit 2 is the movement and
preparatory processing of the raw materials to be used in making a pandanus mat. Storage
of these raw materials is the objective in unit 3, and retrieval of them is the objective in unit
4. The mat manufacturing process begins in unit 5.
(2) All T C C Us are defined by phonological criteria. TCCUs are bounded by silence,
discourse or utterance initially, and by pauses at other initial and terminal boundaries. They
are associated with one rhythm unit, 21 which is composed of one or more intonation
contours and is bounded by pauses or silence. Most TCCUs range from 1 to 2.5 seconds in
length and from three to ten words. 22 When the thematic clause chain unit does not
terminate an SRC, the intonational contour at the terminal border of the TCCU manifests a
downglide and then a slight glide up to a mid pitch followed by a pause.
   Example 9.73 was processed by the CECIL program, which graphed its frequency and
amplitude contours and the length of segments. The TCCUs average 2.32 seconds in length
and approximately 5 words per unit. The longest TCCU (unit 7) lasts for 3 .76 seconds. The
largest TCCU (unit 6) contains 1 0 words. The TCCUs average 2.3 clauses; unit 4 contains 5
clauses.","[344, 345, 346]"
"        However, if the argumentfuka is topicalised, it may precede the verb vase. In the example below, it is
        left-dislocated and marked by mo.
            Fuka=ma, vagha=i vase               fat-iari                    ambu-raira.

        It would also be possible to have the order Vaghaifuka mo ' Regarding the trap, regarding the pig', as
        long as there is a phonological juncture between the topicalised segment and the main sentence
        beginning with vase 'descend'.
1 60     Chapter 5   Some SVcs contain verbal predicates that each have their own object argument. The
verbs in example 5 . 1 3 are singly underlined, and the objects doubly underlined. The first
verb fati has as its obj ect oka ' fish' ; the second verb jumbu has as its object the quantifier
eni 'one', a headless NP, which refers to just one of the previously mentioned fish.

         ' . . . let's strike some fish out in the deep water, pull one in and come (back) up . . . '
   Oblique arguments also intervene between verbs in non-contiguous SVcs. In 5. 1 4, the
locative argument kandajok6.da ' in a palm leaf basket' occurs between bambu 'gather' and
vendido ' put inside' . It is not an argument of bambu 'gather' .

In 5 . 1 5, an instrumental argument, ghaitoimi 'with a pandanus mat', intervenes betweenfiti
'put (down)' and aforugetero 'cover over' and is an oblique argument of afurugetero only.
The NP sasingu is a direct obj ect of both verbs in the SVC, but ghaito faforoda is a locative
argument offiti 'put (down)' only.

         them with (another) pandanus mat. . . '
In 5 . 1 6 the oblique temporal argument, amboda 'afterwards', intervenes between two of the
predicates in a non-contiguous SVC with five verbs in its chain. The first two verbs unumbe
bu 'escort and get' precede the temporal argument and are not within its scope.
5 . 1 6 a.         Stephen+ Tago noaro=ghae             vos-ero
                   Stephen+Tago 3s.wife=COM.D descend. !-SIM.R.3PL.DS

                   and afterwards they ran and came up . . . '
   More than one argument may intervene between verbs in non-contiguous SVcs. In the
following example, an object and an instrument intervene between the verbs vege 'grind
down' and basedo 'bore'.
                                                                                               SVCs      1615. 1 7       Keri         vege     toka kaitaboro=i base=do ...

             ' We grind down a keri bivalve shell and bore a hole in it with a drill and . . . '
In 5 . 1 8 an 0bj ect and a locative intervene between the verbs vose ' descend' and sandi
'catch' . Neither fuka 'pig' nor jughuda 'underneath the house' are arguments of vose
'descend' .
5.l8         ... gegenembo     vose         fuka    jughu=da             sandi

             hit. ! butcher.I-SEQ.SS
             ' . . . the men descended, caught the pig under the house, hit and butchered (it) . . . '
   Larger segments such as purpose constructions and relative constructions sometimes
intervene between verbal constituents of non-contiguous SVcs. A purpose construction
intervenes between ovenembe 'hug the coastline' and sembise 'go across' in example 5 . l 9.
5.19         . .. nengae   ovenembe         Gavide fafo=da   dar-ari=dae

             , . . . the two of them hugged the coastline and crossed over in order to moor
             (the canoe) at Gavide beach . . . '
A relative clause bayau mindena 'the food that I had been eating' is embedded as the object
of babarigedo 'threw away' following the verb stem bune 'not know' in example 5 .20.
5 .20a.       Buv-iri,

              ' It (the helicopter) arrived, and I not knowing (about it), threw away the food
              that I had been eating there and . . . '
    Non-contiguous SVCS are not limited to four predicating verbs. Six verbs occur in
example 5 . 2 1 . The NP bayau ' food' is the object of vendi 'put in' , and the NP avaraka ' fire'
is the object of use 'fan or blow up (the fire)' .
5.2 1        Fegha     viti      kambo jokci=da   bayau             okia=da     vendi

1 62     Chapter 5  The examples in this section have illustrated a general principle that holds for Korafe
chaining constructions. An NP or PP cannot be an argument of any verb that precedes it.6
5 .2.3 INTERVENTION OF CONJUNCTIONS
   Although none of the conjunctions for conjoining clauses may intervene, or follow verb
stems in prototypical SVCs , there are a few instances in which a paratactic conjunction links
a verb stem with a following verb.
   In the SVC labelled (b) in 5 .22, the conjunction a 'and' joins two segments predicated by
bu simbuge ' got and prepared' and bambu ' gathered' . The object of the fIrst two verbs is
roera 'things' , and the object of bambu ' gathered' is the headless NP mendeni ' some' which
refers anaphorically to the internal head oka bayau 'food' of the bracketed relative clause
which precedes it. The two segments are part of the larger non-contiguous SVC that
terminates with the intransitive verbs jovereghe jera 'they turned around and came' .

                   cook.! bake. !-sEQ.SS do.again.! eat.II-DP. I PL.AQ
                 ' While we were doing that, each of us got and packed up our things, and
                 each of us collected some of the food and meat that was uncooked, turned
                 around, came and arrived at our houses , and each of us cooked and baked
                 (the food) again and ate (it).'
    In example 5 .23, the conjunction kotugo ' and also (lit. like a footprint)' is doubly
underlined. It occurs twice, at the beginning of the SVC and following the initial verb bu
' get' .
5 .23      . . kotugo sekago etoto bu kotugo
             .                                              dabade fiti-raera.

           ' . . . and also we again get two (strands), and also we put (them) together. '
Both uses of the conj unction kotugo correlate with fairly long pauses the speaker took while
framing what she wanted to say next.","[179, 180, 181, 182]"
"
      When the revision team were editing the Korafe New Testament, they eliminated some of the tail-head
      lexical verb recapitulations, saying they made the structure too ""heavy"".
          About one third of the legends the Korafe have published have some extended sections which lack
      tail-head linkage. The legend Usu da Kiki 'The story of the coconut' has almost no tail-head linkage.
      The basic story is narrated in what one would presume is principally iconic order. Twelve of the 22
      sentences are SRCs. But there are only four instances of lexical verb recapitulation and one generic verb
      recapitulation in the entire discourse.
                                                             Introduction to Korafe discourse   34126.      Gagara    ava       undu-raera.

( 1 ) Thematic paragraphs freely admit all sentence types as their constituents. This
      paragraph has eight sentences. Four sentences have only one clause. Sentence 20 is
      composed of a theme with its rheme filled by a stative existential clause. Sentences 2 1
      and 23 are topic-comment clauses terminated by copulas. Sentence 26 has a transitive
      clause as its constituent. Three are multiclausal. Sentence 22 is a conditional sentence
      with two bases. Sentence 25 is an antecedent-consequence sentence involving the
      universal quantifier. The second base of sentence 25 is an SRC. SO are sentences 24 and
      27.
(2) The number of NPs per verb is much greater in thematic paragraphs than in chaining
    paragraphs. Discounting the two verbs that are grammaticised conjunctions in this
    context (edo ' and' and ava sedo 'therefore'), there are 1 2 verbs and two copular
    predicates comprising 1 3 clauses. Only four clauses do not have arguments: irira
    (sentence 24), fati gitioro and arnburaira (sentence 2 5), and irera (sentence 27) and
    they are constituents of the three SRCs in this paragraph. Of the 1 8 NPs, three are left­
    dislocated. The rest are arguments in clauses, with one clause having three NPs, four
    clauses having two NPs, and four clauses having one NP.
(3) Thematic paragraphs can have final verbs that differ from each other in tense marking.
    Sentences 20, 25, and 27 terminate with final verbs having the present tense. Sentence
    22 has future tense final verb forms, and sentences 25 and 26 have customary final
    verb forms. Sentences 21 and 23 terminating with copulas are realis, but not tense­
    specific.
(4) Thematic paragraphs are semantically configured to communicate a dominant theme or
    a proposition with its supporting arguments. They accomplish this by:
      (a) repeating a key word or idea. The initial and final sentences in this paragraph in
          Bijo Gharube da Geka have a thematic NP with similar content: oroko rno 'at this
          time', oroko erno 'here and now' .
      (b) juxtaposing sentences or groups of sentences that convey parallel notions.
          Sentences 20, 24, and 27 all end with forms of irari ' remain' . Together with the
          two tenseless copular sentences 2 1 and 23 and the customary tense bases 25 and
          26, they build up a picture of the ' as is' situation in the women's village now.
      (c) heading sentences with conjunctions that signal a rhetorical relationship with the
          preceding sentence(s). Sentences 20, 2 1 , and 25 begin with conjunctions. None of
          the sentences are linked by tail-head verb recapitulation.
  The thematic paragraph in 1 0.2 is typical of thematic paragraphs in its structure, but it
manifests only one of many semantic configurations possible for thematic paragraphs.
342      Chapter 1 0Some other semantic configurations found in thematic paragraphs are described in the
material given in § 1 0.3.2.","[360, 361, 362]"

12    According to Longacre (1 972:68-69, 90-9 1), ""natural languages contain in their lexical structure certain
       Expectancy Chains. An Expectancy Chain may involve (i) a succession of actions which customarily
       follow each other in chronological order; (ii) an intent to act plus the action itself; (iii) an obligation to
      act plus the action; or (iv) the ability to act plus the action ... around the world, we find Expectancy
      Chains which involve successive actions such as: 'leave (someplace). .. go. . . arrive '; 'search. . .find';
        'waste away. . . die '; fall down. . . smash. ...
                                                        '
           Expectancy Chains which involve Succession with different actors are such as the following:
        'shoot... die '; 'hit.. . die '; 'call... answer... '; 'give (to someone) ... appreciate '; give (to someone) ... cook (it) '.
       Although most of his examples are paired collocations, Longacre does not clearly differentiate paired
       clause sequences from scripts. (See discussion of scripts in Chapter 1 0.) And two of his multimembered
      expectancy chains definitely correspond more closely to scripts: 'go with hooks... tie hooks. . . catch
      fish. . . bringfish. .. eat ' and 'cook in leaves.. .put into container... bring to the canoe... come down '.
           The standardised clause sequences described in this chapter, for the most part, contain two verbs.
       They are lexically, grammatically, and phonologically constrained. Korafe scripts often involve more
      than two verbs. Although the verbs in Korafe scripts are lexically constrained, the definition of scripts
       does not involve grammatical or phonological constraints.

   When these sequences are negated, a discrepancy between their syntax and semantics
occasionally occurs. Syntactically, the negative focus marker jo must precede V I and V2
must be marked by ae. However, in these cases the semantics of the situation indicate that,
while the event represented by V I did not happen, the event represented by V2 did. In (9. 1 8)
the initial clause contains the negative focus marker and its verb is marked irrealis, and the
second predication has the negative deverbal along with the copula.
9. 1 8   Jo    nune    genembo jigh-ari                  amb-ae=ri.
         NEG 3S.ACT man              hold.l-SEQ.IR.3S.DS die .I-not.do=COP.AQ
         ' It wasn't he that killed the man.'
In reality, the first event is the one that did not happen, but a death actually did occur. The
one accused did not perform the sorcery, but the man did die.
   In standardised clause sequences such as the one in 9. 1 8, the speaker must must make V I
a final verb if he or she wants to negate one verbal constituent without negating the other,
as example 9. 1 9 illustrates.
9. 1 9   Nu genembo kae+jigh-ira,                avata            jQ      amb-ae=ri.

17   The term 'sentence' is not easily defined. Three types differentiated by Lyons ( 1 977:622-635) are:
     system-sentences, text-sentences, and utterance-units. System-sentences can be generated from the
     formal grammatical rules without reference to any deictic or endophoric context. Text-sentences are
     ""context-dependent utterance-signals (or parts of utterance-signals)"" (Lyons 1 977:622). Utterance-units
     are a subset of utterances which Harris ( 1 95 1 : 1 4) defines as ""any stretch of talk by one person, before
     and after which there is silence on the part of that person"". Simple utterance units ""contain one and only
     one simple proposition"" and ""are the basic units of language behaviour"" (Lyons 1 977:633).
          The term ' simple sentences' used here approximates the abstract grammatical construct termed
     ' system-sentences', allowing, as Lyons ( I 977:626) suggests, that at least some part of their prosodic
     structure, including their intonation contour, be accounted for. Declarative, interrogative and imperative
     sentences are system-sentences with a particular grammatical structure. When system-sentences are
     contextualised by language speakers, they can be regarded as ""utterance-un its-to which such terms as
     ' statement', 'question', and 'command' are applicable ( 1 977:633).""

       3S that.CT.say.II poison+find.I-TP.3s.FN=perhaps
       ' He, well I ' m just not sure, perhaps he's gotten sick.'
In example 4.96, the speaker uses ta to express his annoyance with the addressee and with
the current state of affairs.
4.96   Ghaka beje-tira,           e    gi=ta!

       'Now look at this (that you've done), the canoe's busted! '
   I n addition to the base, Korafe simple sentences may have initial peripheral segments,
one or more themes (P2), and a tail (P3). Initial peripheral segments usually occur sentence­
initially, but sometimes they follow the theme, as shown in example 4.95 . The initial
peripheral constituents include evaluative/pause words and vocatives. Examples of
evaluative (or pause) words are avori 'all right', avose 'perhaps', rnrn 'yes' and others.
Vocatives may follow evaluative words or be the initial segment in a sentence. They are
                                                                                        ,
either a person's name or kin relationship optionally followed by ko 'dear (honorific) or 0
'that (distal-2 used in declamations)' . Example 4.97 illustrates an evaluative peripheral
word followed by a vocative kin expression. The base is simply a predicate filled by a verb
in the hortative form.
4.97   Avori, nanda rnandi, yaore!
       all.right l S.GEN boy,      go.NDUR-IR.H . l PL.CR
       'All right, my boy, let's go ! '
   Like initial peripheral segments, themes are separated off by a pause from the rest o f the
sentence. In simple sentences, themes may either be NPs or PPs which may be additionally
marked by a topic marker (rno or va). Section 3 .2.3 . 1 provides fuller details and examples
of themes.
   Tails (P3) follow the sentence base. The tag words, ai 'yes ' , ai tefo 'yes or no' often
mark polar questions and are used along with prosodic features to distinguish them from
other sentence types. Examples are given in §4.7.2.3. Other examples of tail constituents
can be found in §3.2.3 . 1 .","[159, 160]"

temporal framework, which distinguishes the event it signals as prior to or overlapping with
the event signalled by the following medial or final verb. Since each medial verb has as its
temporal reference point the temporal framework of the next verb in the sequence, the
terminal verb provides the ultimate reference point. The semantic scope of the inflections
for absolute tense, aspect, mood and speech-act value marked on the terminal verb extends
over the entire sequence. Medial verbs are thus in a syntactic and semantic dependency
relationship with the terminal verb. The modus operandi of this dependency relationship is
illustrated in §6.2.
   Referential relationships indicated by medial verbs are ' same-subject following' (Ss) and
'different-subject following' ( DS). The default referential value of non-finite medial verb
forms marked by zero is interpreted to be ' same-subject following' . Different subject
marking stipulates non-coreference of the subjects of the marking and reference clauses.
Korafe D S medial verbs carry two sets of subject markers. The first set of markers,
indicating the person and number of the referent of the subject in the marking clause is the
same as the set of absolute subject markers (person and number) that occurs on independent
final verbs. The second set of markers, final -0 (-i for third person singular), signals non­
coreference of the subject referents of marking and reference clauses ? But neither SS nor
DS markings, such as the final { -o} of the DS suffix set, specify the person and number of
the subject in the reference clause. Korafe does not have anticipatory subject markers.
    Because medial verbs can be temporally distinguished from each other, manifesting their
own tense or location in time relative to that of the next verb in the chain, medial verbs
joined in SRCs can each be considered to predicate clauses, manifesting peripheral layer
j uncture. 3 Although SRCs are multi-clausal, their constituents exhibit features that
characterise core juncture. It is common for clauses in an SRC to share a core argument and
a common location. The two clauses in example 6.2 share the core argument fuka 'pig',
object in the first clause and subject in the second.
6.2 a.        Ne fuka d-etero                           b. amb-ira.

              'They killed the pig. (lit. They struck the pig, and it died.) ,
There are no overt NPs in the clause labelled (b), even thoughfuka 'pig' is understood to be
the subject. It is common to find terminal clauses in SRCs with no NPs.","[197, 198]"

1 0.2 GENERAL DISCOURSE STRUCTURE RULES
  All discourses occur in a deictic context. This includes the speaker, the addressee(s), the
world view(s) of the speech act participants, the setting within which the speaker is
communicating the information, his or her reason for communicating it, and the
appropriateness of the information for the occasion.
    Discourse structure rules specify the things that may be said and the order in which they
may be said. In this section, we focus on the general set of constituents, which are part of
all oral discourses and texts.
   All oral discourses and texts have an introduction, a plot or a theme with its supporting
arguments, and a conclusion. Many also have a final formulaic closing statement. Legends
and letters have in addition formulaic introductory words which signal the discourse onset,
called 'apertures' .",[362]
