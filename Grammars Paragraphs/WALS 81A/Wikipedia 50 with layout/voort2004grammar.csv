3.3.2. Predicate and argumentsIn intransitive sentences, subject-verb (SV) order is encountered more often
than verb-subject (VS) order, but upon explicit inquiry both are usually al-
lowed. Note the following sets of examples:(30) 'xyi-dy-hͿ     'kopu ko-'ro-tse
     you-POS-NOM cup without-CL:cup-DEC
     ‘your cup is empty’(31) ko-'ro-tse          'xyi-dy-hͿ 'kopu
     without-CL:cup-DEC you-POS-NOM cup
     ‘your cup is empty’(32) e'tay xyi-dy-'hͿ-re                  (33) xyi-dy-'hͿ-re e'tay
     wife I-POS-NOM-INT                        I-POS-NOM-INT wife
     ‘is she your wife?’                       ‘is she your wife?’
83. The order 2-3-1 is also permitted.
                                                3.3. Remarks on word order   101In transitive sentences, object-verb (OV) order is encountered more often than
verb-object (VO) order, but upon explicit inquiry both are usually allowed.
Note the next pairs of examples:(34) kreBa-'na ã'rǊi waja-'nã-da-ki
     Gleba-LOC tapir bring-FUT-1S-DEC
     ‘I’m going to take the horse to Gleba’ (riding it or not)(35) kreBa-'na waja-'nã-da-ki         ã'rǊi
     Gleba-LOC bring-FUT-1S-DEC tapir
     ‘I’m going to take the horse to Gleba’ (riding it or not)(36) tsİ̘   hedy-'ra                      (37) hedy-'ra tsİ̘
     salt mix-IMP                              mix-IMP salt
     ‘put salt (on the food/drink)!’           ‘put salt (on the food/drink)!’In transitive sentences with an overt subject and an overt object, the order is
usually SVO or SOV. No difference in meaning has been discovered between
these different orders:(38) kanwã=ekai-'e o'tsi-ki zjwãu         (39) kanwã=ekai-'e zjwãu o'tsi-ki
     canoe=leg-too kill-DEC João               canoe=leg-too João kill-DEC
     ‘the car killed João’84                   ‘the car killed João’About an OSV equivalent of the above examples, my consultant remarked that
this would be nonsense:(40) *?zjwãu kanwã=ekai-'e o'tsi-ki
     João      canoe=leg-too kill-DEC
     ‘João killed the car’Apparently then, in a construction where subject and object precede the predi-
cate, the first position is likely to be reserved for the subject.85
   Other word orders have also been attested. Notice the following SVO ex-
ample:(41) ho'Bİto aure-da'mͿ-tse      hita-'wã
     Roberto marry-want-DEC Rita-AO
     ‘Roberto (says he) wants to marry Rita’
84. Animate object marking was not considered as very grammatical: *zjwãwã.
85. If ‘car’ would be marked as an animate object: kanwã?ekai'?ewã, the OSV order
    would be acceptable, according to my teacher, but the meaning of the sentence
    would be nonsense.
102   3. Parts of speech and constituent orderThe constituents of this example can occur in the following alternative OVS
order, apparently without change of meaning:(42) hita-'wã aure-da'mͿ-tse     ho'Bİto
     Rita-AO marry-want-DEC Roberto
     ‘Roberto (says he) wants to marry Rita’The order in (42) was considered as the “clearest” alternative, so this does indi-
cate that word order is not totally free. However, it does not necessarily mean
that SVO order is in general better than OVS. Notice the following example:(43) kuraku'ra 'tsje-ki       jere'xwa
     chicken      close-DEC jaguar
     ‘jaguar grabbed chicken’As mentioned in (4.1.1.6.), there may be a relation between the presumed op-
tionality of the animate case marker and word order. The nature of this relation,
however, has not been established so far. Note that on the application of an
animate case marker, VSO and SOV equivalents of (43) are also allowed:(44) 'tsje-ki     jere'xwa ku'rakura-'wã
     close-DEC jaguar chicken-AO
     ‘jaguar grabbed chicken’(45) jere'xwa kuraku'ra-wã 'tsje-ki
     jaguar chicken-AO        close-DEC
     ‘jaguar grabbed chicken’The range of word order variability may not only depend partially on case
marking, but also on overt cross-reference agreement of subjects and the em-
phatic use of pronouns. Compare the following examples:(46) si 'kui-da-ki       hã                 (47) hã    'kui-da-ki
     I drink-1S-DEC water                        water drink-1S-DEC
     ‘it is me who is drinking/drank water’      ‘I am drinking/drank water’(48) *si hã    'kui-da-ki
     I water drink-1S-DEC
     ‘it is me who is drinking/drank water’Example (48) was considered ungrammatical, but it is not clear how that
should be interpreted. In ditransitive sentences, the order relative position of
the direct and indirect objects is also variable:
                                                 3.3. Remarks on word order   103(49) mƭu      marju-'wã 'hai-da-ki
     chicha Mario-AO drench-1S-DEC
     ‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’(50) mƭu      'hai-da-ki       marju-'wã
     chicha drench-1S-DEC Mario-AO
     ‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’The following order is also permitted, although it is considered as less well-
formed:(51) marju-'wã mƭu         'hai-da-ki
     Mario-AO chicha drench-1S-DEC
     ‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’
3.3.3. Predicate and satellitesThe relative order of predicate and local satellites seems to be free. Compare
the next example to (34) :(52) ã'rǊi waja-'nã-da-ki      kreBa-'na
     tapir bring-FUT-1S-DEC Gleba-LOC
     ‘I’m going to take the horse to Gleba’ (riding it or not)Notice also the following set of alternatives:(53) ͅrjãwã-'na o'nİ-ki               (54) o'nİ-ki    ͅrjãwã-'na
     forest-LOC return-DEC                 return-DEC forest-LOC
     ‘he came/went out of the forest’      ‘he came/went out of the forest’
3.3.4. Predicate and adverbsThe relative order of predicate and adverbs is variable. The adverb occurs often
at the beginning or at the end of a clause:(55) la'to         tsu'ty kukui-'dy-da-ky-hͿ-ki
     yesterday head hurt-CAU-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC
     ‘I had a pain in the head yesterday’(56) la'to         kukui-'dy-da-ky-hͿ-ki             tsu'ty
     yesterday hurt-CAU-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC              head
     ‘I had a pain in the head yesterday’
104   3. Parts of speech and constituent order(57) kukui-'dy-da-ky-hͿ-ki            tsu'ty la'to
     hurt-CAU-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC head yesterday
     ‘I had a pain in the head yesterday’The adverb does not necessarily occur at the periphery of the clause:(58) a-ri'tsa        a'wͿi-da-ki coha-si'ki
     Ø-DR:outside see-1S-DEC foot-CL:skin
     ‘I saw a shoe outside’ (S outside (looking in))(59) a'wͿi-da-ki a-ri'tsa          coha-si'ki
     see-1S-DEC Ø-DR:outside foot-CL:skin
     ‘I saw a shoe outside’ (S outside (looking in))
3.3.5. Noun and modifierThe usual constituent order of modification constructions is head-dependent:(60) txa'hͿ tsi'cwa-rjͿ         'Ǌi-da-ki
     path       begin-CD:area lie-1S-DEC
     ‘I rested at the beginning of the road’However, an alternative order is also attested. Compare these examples:(61) 'tauBa a'xy-dy-a-'hͿ                (62) a'xy-dy-a-'hͿ          'tauBa
     board     house-CAU-1P-NOM               house-CAU-1P-NOM board
     ‘boards to build a house’                ‘boards to build a house’The following set of examples shows how the relative order between a noun
and a demonstrative modifier order may vary, and even how a matrix predicate
may be inserted between an argument and the demonstrative:(63) ko'sa Ϳ-'hͿ       si-dy-'hͿ-ki (64) Ϳ-'hͿ      ko'sa si-dy-'hͿ-ki
     sun this-NOM I-POS-NOM-DEC          this-NOM sun I-POS-NOM-DEC
     ‘the / this lantern is mine’        ‘the / this lantern is mine’(65) ko'sa 'si-dy-hͿ-ki           Ϳ-'hͿ
     sun I-POS-NOM-DEC this-NOM
     ‘the / this lantern is mine’However, it may be possible that the demonstrative in (65) stands in extraposi-
tion.

                            The noun phrase
Kwaza nouns are not inflected for number, gender or definiteness. Kwaza
nouns may take case markers and possessive markers. Nominalisation of verb
stems is important in Kwaza, and it may involve the use of classifiers. Some
nouns, such as 'rai?ͿhͿ ‘thing, animal’ are based on non-existing verb roots.
There are no articles. There is no formally marked category of adjectives in
Kwaza. Attributive noun modification is realised through juxtaposition of
nouns, be they bare nouns or nominalised verbs.
   In the present chapter, Kwaza nouns and noun morphology will be de-
scribed. In section (4.1.) I will discuss case marking and its functions. Section
(4.2.) contains a thorough presentation of classifiers, including their verbal
characteristics. In (4.3.) I present the basic properties of attributive modifica-
tion, which includes a discussion of possessive constructions. Section (4.4.)
deals with a number of relatively heterogenous nominal suffixes. In (4.5.) the
Kwaza numeral system is discussed. In (4.6.) the demonstrative system is dis-
cussed. Finally in (4.7.) Kwaza pronouns are discussed.","[138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143]"

This is a description of a language. More specifically, this is the first comprehen-
sive documentation and study of the Kwaza language of Brazil. It is based on re-
search and interviews with native speakers between 1995 and 2002 in the
Guaporé region. This book is a corrected and thoroughly revised version of my
doctoral dissertation. Although no description of any language will ever be com-
plete and definitive, I believe nevertheless that the present work provides a repre-
sentative and reliable outline of the language. Even though this book concerns the
indigenous heritage of Brazil, it was for several reasons necessary to publish it in
English. I hope that there will be a Portuguese version one day, that is accessible
to both the indigenous peoples of Rondônia and a wider Brazilian public.
    Without the cooperation of native speakers, I could not have written this
grammar. In this sort of work native language consultants of field researchers
have often been called “informants”. Lately the term “collaborators” has been
proposed because that correctly reflects a more active role in the research on the
part of the consultant, and also because “informants” has developed a pejorative
connotation in certain contexts. However, since “collaborators” has at least as pe-
jorative a connotation in certain other contexts, I have avoided the use of either
one of them. Therefore I refer to the native speakers I worked with as my “con-
sultants” or, where it does not sound awkward, as my “teachers”. Whatever con-
notation these terms may develop in the future, in this book they intend to convey
reference to highly intelligent, kind and active participants in scientific research.

           Parts of speech and constituent order
The complexity of Kwaza grammar resides to a large extent in its morphology.
Kwaza morphology is predominatingly suffixing. By contrast, the syntax of
Kwaza is fairly simple. Both SVO and SOV word orders occur frequently, but
alternative orders are often allowed. Possibly, Kwaza word order is determined
by discourse-related factors.
    The Kwaza word may consist of roots, derivational morphemes and inflex-
ional morphemes, in that order. Of several categories, e.g. the classifiers and
the object markers, it may be difficult to say whether they are inflexional or
derivational. So far, over 300 suffixes were identified.
    Kwaza word classes include nouns, verbs, adverbs and several “particles”.
Although the distinction between nouns and verbs may not be absolute in
Kwaza, it is justifiable to say that verb morphology is more complicated than
noun morphology, especially with regard to inflexion.
    The present chapter deals with parts of speech, types of morphemes and
constituent order. It is relatively brief since it really only serves to define the
basic concepts that are required for the understanding of the grammar of
Kwaza, the complexity of which I regard as mainly morphological in nature. In
(3.1.) the parts of speech of Kwaza will be introduced and discussed, (3.2.) rep-
resents an inventory of different types of morphemes and their distribution, and
in (3.3.) basic characteristics of Kwaza word order will be discussed and illus-
trated.","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129]"
"
1.9.   Structural characteristics of KwazaThe Kwaza vowel system comprises eight oral vowel phonemes and seven na-
sal vowel phonemes. The central close-mid vowel /y/ also occurs in semivowel
position. Nasality may spread to neighbouring vowels. There are 19 consonant
phonemes, among which implosive and apico-alveolar stops. Basic syllable
structure is Consonant-Vowel, and glides may occupy consonant position, ei-
ther together with other consonants or not. There is no phonemic tone, stress or
quantity. Main word stress tends to fall on the ultimate syllable of the stem. A
provisional analysis of the phonology of Kwaza was published by van der
Voort (1997a).
    The grammatical categories of Kwaza are verbs, nouns, adverbs, particles,
ideophones and auxiliary-like roots. There are no adjectives. Constituent order
in Kwaza is relatively free, although Subject-Verb-Object and Subject-Object-
Verb patterns prevail. Morphologically, Kwaza is a highly complex language
and most of the grammatical load is to be found on the verbs. There are over
300 derivational and inflexional suffixes and the distinction between these
categories is gradual rather than absolute. There are no complex morphopho-
nological processes. Reduplication and compounding occur frequently.
24    1. Introduction    Nominal morphology is fairly simple. Nouns, including pronouns, demon-
stratives and numerals, are not inflected for number or gender. Only a third
person possessor may be morphologically marked. Nouns may receive animate
object case marking or one of the oblique case markers: instrumental, locative,
beneficiary and comitative. Nouns can be zero-verbalised by attachment of per-
son and mood marking. Nouns can be modified by other nouns which are
placed in juxtaposition. Because complex verb forms can be nominalised and
function as nouns, nouns can of course be morphologically complex.
    Verbs are obligatorily marked for subject and mood, whereas overt pro-
nominal or lexical arguments are optional. Both the subject agreement system
and the personal pronoun system contain a distinction between first person in-
clusive and first person exclusive. Since the system explicitly indicates exclu-
sive agreement, by the form -xa-, the notions “singular” and “plural” are used
for convenience sake, even though the system is analysed as being based on
distinctions of “association”. Third person agreement is zero-marked. Indefinite
argument agreement has no lexical counterpart. Mood inflexion comprises de-
clarative, interrogative, the three persuasive moods imperative, exhortative and
volitive, which complement one another, and three prohibitive moods negative
imperative, negative exhortative and monitory. In the imperative and negative
imperative, second person “singular” subject agreement is zero-marked. Object
agreement of the verb is optional and can perhaps be regarded as derivational.
Negation, valency and valency change, and tense, modality and aspect are also
marked by a wide array of (probably derivational) verbal morphemes. Some
morphemes of modality are etymologically related to mood markers, such as
the causational morpheme -nƭ- and the exhortative mood marker -ni. Verbs can
be turned into nouns or adverbs by the highly multifunctional stem-final nomi-
nalising morphemes -hͿ and -nãi.
    Two quite prominent morphological categories in Kwaza are those of class
and directionality. Classifying morphemes have a very wide distribution and
may have nominalising and agreement properties. They can have a very general
meaning and refer to shape, substance and texture, but the majority are seman-
tically rather specific. In the present analysis, there are close to 150 classifiers.
Directional morphemes have a more limited distribution. They either occur on
verbs, where they indicate the direction in which an action or event takes place,
or they are used to form directional adverbs. There are nearly 45 directionals.
The distributions of classifiers and directionals overlap partially, and a small
number of these morphemes are ambiguous in this respect.
    The moods mentioned earlier are restricted to matrix clauses. In Kwaza sev-
eral different types of subordinate clauses may be formed. Subordinate clauses
usually precede matrix clauses. The predicates of subordinate clauses contain
the same subject agreement forms as mentioned earlier, but they have different
“mood” markers. Among the adverbial clauses there are two types of condi-
tional clauses, two basic types of concessive clauses, and additive, manner,
temporal and contemporative clauses, all marked by different predicate-final
morphemes. Among the nominal clauses there are attributive (relative) clauses
                                      1.9. Structural characteristics of Kwaza   25and complement clauses. These involve the same nominalisers as referred to
above. Kwaza does neither have infinitives nor conjunctional particles. How-
ever, long chains of medial clauses can be constructed through the cosubordi-
native “mood” marker. In these constructions a distinction is made between
same subject and different subject. The different subject marker is always
found on the subordinate clause, whereas it indicates that the subject of the next
clause is going to be different. When one of the different subjects is a non-third
person, a special switch reference mood marker is required.
    A special phenomenon in Kwaza, rare among the Amerindian languages, is
morphological ellipsis. Although verbs are canonically obligatorily marked for
person and mood, these inflexions can be omitted if the context permits. In-
versely, the inflexional complex of person and mood marking can occur freely
without a verb stem under similar circumstances. In both situations the hearer
can be expected to deduce from the context which verb stem or which inflex-
ions were intended by the speaker. On a more grammatical level, independently
occurring person and mood inflexions can also function as resumptive parti-
cles, and double layers of person and mood inflexion are instrumental in mor-
phologically complex constructions which have “complementising” functions
such as desiderative and quotation. A discussion of these phenomena from the
perspective of grammaticalisation was also the subject of a separate article (van
der Voort 2002a). Other unique grammatical phenomena in Kwaza concern
morphologically motivated reduplication of bound person markers to express
tense distinctions, and alternative morpheme orders to formally express the
distinction between canonical negation and negation of a presupposition.
    In the lexicon of Kwaza many items are encountered which show morpho-
logical structure. Often, formally similar roots without such morphological
complexity are semantically related, but not in an entirely productive way.
Therefore, such apparent morphological complexity is considered as lexicalised
and such roots are treated as monomorphemic. Nevertheless, there are certain
roots which are (semi-)lexicalised with morphemes that retain some productive
properties, such as those of the verb stem haka-(hͿ)- ‘to be old’. In the present
work I refer to these latter roots as bound or etymological roots.

(2000b). Aikhenvald and Dixon (1999:363-364) contains a brief typological
characterisation of the language.","[61, 62, 63, 64]"
"
3.2.1. Bound morphemesThere are three types of bound morphemes in Kwaza: roots, suffixes and pre-
fixes. The roots have usually a lexical semantic content, whereas the affixes
tend to have a more abstract grammatical content. From a semantic perspective,
the distinction is not absolute, since there are also affixes with a highly lexical
content, which is in contrast to certain semantically rather empty roots.
    Roots can be subdivided further. The canonical verbal roots constitute one
of the two big open word classes. The bound roots represent a specific type that
consists of three closed classes of specific verb roots which require further
derivation by a nominaliser, a classifier or an attributive morpheme. Only
thereafter may they (non-obligatorily) receive person and mood inflexions.
This type includes genuine numeral roots, demonstrative roots and a number of
roots which have an “adjectival” semantic content. A third type is represented
by the two dummy roots nãi- ‘to be like’ and jã- ‘to be’, which have auxiliary
functions in the sentence and which also occur in many expressions. The final
type is represented by the noun formative empty root e- and the adverb forma-
tive empty root a-.
    Suffixes can be further subdivided into inflexional and derivational suffixes.
Although there is no sharp boundary between these categories, one can roughly
say that derivational suffixes are facultative and their application modifies the
meaning and/or the category of the word, whereas inflexional suffixes are in
principle obligatory and do not modify the word’s meaning but indicate the
syntactic function of sentence constituents. In the present work the inflexional
suffixes are considered not to have category changing properties, because when
attached to noun roots, they form inflected nouns, and when attached to verb
roots they form inflected verbs. However, noun roots may receive verb inflex-
ions and then function as verb roots without any other grammatical marking. I
considered this as zero-verbalisation, i.e.: verbalisation is the default value of
category change in absence of a specific verbalising morpheme. This approach
is possible, because change into one of the the other categories is always ac-
companied by specific nominalising or adverbialising morphemes.
    The demonstrative proximal and distal prefixes are the only proper prefixes
in Kwaza. Apart from these, certain concomitants of compounded roots may
behave as either prefixes or suffixes.
                                                     3.2. Types of morphemes      97   Note that in Kwaza, reduplication is not only defined by phonotactic
boundaries, i.e. it does not exclusively concern reduplication of roots or sylla-
bles. Also certain bound morphemes such as person markers can be redupli-
cated, as a special grammatical means to express aspectual and temporal differ-
ences. This is discussed in section (7.3.).

derivational morphemes may follow, such as possessive and attributive. In the
subsequent positions classifiers or a nominaliser or other derivational mor-
phemes may occur. If relevant, the noun may be terminated by an object argu-
ment case or oblique case inflexion. The obligatory slots are in bold print:Table 13. Morpheme positions in the noun

                         classifier
                         otherIn canonical verbs there are more positions. First comes an obligatory root.
Thereafter optional derivational morphemes follow, such as directional, classi-
fier, attributive, tense, modality, aspect, valency change, object person and
negative morphemes, more or less in that order. Thereafter come the obligatory
subject person and the word-final mood inflexions. In certain constructions,
derivational elements such as the negative morpheme and a tense, modality or
aspect morpheme occur between the person and mood inflexions.","[134, 135, 136]"

7.4.1. Verbal compoundsCompounding of verb roots is a very common and productive way to link up
events in Kwaza. Verbal inflexion is marked only on the last member of the
compound. Consider the following examples:(3035)    kuri=tsi'kja-da-ki          (3036)       kui='hay-da-ki
          stop=stand-1S-DEC                        drink=cut.off-1S-DEC
          ‘I stopped, and stayed put’              ‘I drank until half (the glass)’(3037)    konajã'dy=a-tsy-wy         ace'rjͿ-ki
          sweat=exist-POT-time       nigh-DEC
          ‘the hot rainy season is coming’ (lit. ‘the time of sweat is nigh’)
568   7. Other morphosyntactic structuresThe first member of a compound may be morphologically complex to some
extent:(3038)   kawİ      'kui-e=a-tsy-wy         ace'rjͿ-ki
         coffee drink-again=exist-POT-time nigh-DEC
         ‘coffee-time is arriving’(3039)   cari-'ty=asa-a-ni
         kill-DET=leave-1P-EXH
         ‘let’s kill him off!’ (t)(3040)   cari-'nã=asa-le-hͿ             tsoho'roi=oja-hͿ-lİ
         kill-FUT=leave-FRUST-NOM run=go-NOM-PREC
         ‘wanting to kill it, however, it got away, then’ (t)(3041)   nͿ-hͿ=txu'hǊi-tse
         big-NOM=small-DEC
         ‘it is somewhat big’ (but not very big)There are several different kinds of relationships between compounded roots.
This depends on the semantics of the concerned roots and on the relative order
of the concomitants of the compound structure. The compound may reflect a
sequence of events:(3042)   towİ=ca'we-ki
         break=go.down-DEC
         ‘he broke branch and fell down’(3043)   jere'xwa      wãwͿi=tu'ru-tja nwã'rã 'dai=warja-ta
         jaguar        sleep=wake-CSO cudgel take=bring-CSO
         ‘jaguar slept, woke up and took a wooden machete’ (t)The internal order of sequential compounds is iconic. Depending on the se-
mantics of the verb root, some orders are logically excluded:(3044)   terja=hy'ja=tse                    (3045)   *?hy'ja=te'rja-tse
         slide.down=fall-DEC                         fall=slide.down-DEC
         ‘he slipped and fell’                       ‘he fell and slipped’Nevertheless, the order can be reversed, in accordance with an alternative
course of events. This may lead to somewhat different lexicalised meanings. In
the following examples, the verb root buru- ‘to pass or visit a place which is
inhabited by people’ is combined with the verb root oja- ‘to go away, leave’, in
different orders:
                                                            7.4. Composition   569(3046)   ay-'rjͿ          oja=bu'ru-ki

verbal complement:(3056)   'mİ̘-e-dy-ta      emã=hã'rã-tja

570   7. Other morphosyntactic structuresWhen one of the members of a compound is semantically attributive, it modi-
fies the other member, as if it were an adverb:(3058)   wai=txu'hǊi-tse
         good=small-DEC
         ‘it got a little better’(3059)   tyka?o=txu'hǊi-tara-mͿ

         black=paint-CAU-NOM-1O-DEC
         ‘I’m painted black (with genipap) by someone’   Several verb roots with a relatively abstract meaning occur so frequently as
a second element in a verbal compound that they are like suffixes. The root
kwİ- ‘to enter’ was illustrated in (5.3.1.) to function often in the same way as a
directional morpheme. Note the following “illative” compound:(3061)   towİ='kwİ-tja
         go=enter-CSO
         ‘they went into (the forest, house, corral etc.)’ (t)The verb root asa- ‘to end, leave behind, separate from’ is usually a second
element in a compound verb and adds a terminative meaning ‘into bits, into
oblivion, away’:(3062)   do'te=asa-hͿ-ki                (3063)    ha'dai=asa-xa-tsy-tse

                                                  (when you run into a jaguar)’
(3064)   ywy'nwͿ       'dy=asa-wa-ki
         tree          cut=leave-IS-DEC
         ‘they cut the log in order to clear it out of the way’As mentioned in (5.4.10.), asa- has a singular object. Its plural equivalent uja-
is also usually compounded:(3065)   ywy'nwͿ       'dy=uja-wa-ki
         tree          cut=leave-IS-DEC
         ‘they cut the many logs in order to clear them out of the way’Similarly, the verb root bwa- ‘to end, finish’ adds a completive meaning as a
second member in a compound:
                                                           7.4. Composition   571(3066)   'boi-dy=bwa-dy-'ra            (3067)    ba='bwa-cwa-ki
         full-CAU=end-CAU-IMP                    cut=finish-IS-DEC
         ‘fill it up for him!’                   ‘they finished clearing a field’Also the verb hãrã- ‘to stop’, as in (3056), is used as a second element with an
aspectual meaning. This was also discussed in (5.5.23.).
   The benefactive function of the verb root wady- ‘to give’ as a second mem-
ber of a compound was discussed in section (5.4.4.). Here, a few examples will
suffice:(3068)   ui         kurje=wa'dy-nƭnã-da-ki       (3069)    kwe=wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-ra
         tobacco wind=give-2O-1S-DEC                       string=give-1SO-IMP
         ‘I rolled a cigarette for you’                    ‘string it for me!’(3070)   lonã-'na      hy=kwİ=wa'dy-da-ki
         hole-LOC go=enter=give-1S-DEC
         ‘I entered into the hole for him’Some compound constructions, like those involving wady- ‘give’, are like se-
rial verbs: they contain several verbs, but they refer to a single event. The fol-
lowing examples contain constructions which also seem to represent “serial
compounds”:(3071)   i'tsosisi 'dy=wanİ-ra             (3072)    were=oja-'tay-nahere
         cord      cut=bring-IMP                     revolt=go-CL:woman-COL
         ‘bring me a piece of rope!’                 ‘the runaway women’(3073)   tswa tso'roi=oja-ta kwİ-da'mͿ-tse
         man run=go-CSO        enter-want-DEC
         ‘the man ran towards the cavern’Compounds involving the verb root wanİ- ‘bring’ may have a similar function
as with wady- ‘give’, but not as regular and as abstract. They should probably
not be regarded as serial compounds:(3074)   e-si'ki      'dy=wanİ-ra (3075)         coha-si'ki      'dai=wanİ-ra
         Ø-CL:skin cut=bring-IMP                 foot-CL:skin    take=bring-IMP
         ‘cut and give me a piece of cloth!’     ‘pick up and bring the shoes!’   Compounded structures may consist of more than two verb roots. The fol-
lowing examples contain triple and quadruple compounds:(3076)   ywy'nwͿ        dury=oce=cwͿ'te-da-ki
         tree           roll=throw=off.path-1S-DEC

           ‘then he shot it down and tore it to bits, that’s how it went328‘ (t)  Compounding may be recursive in that the same verb root is repeated in one

           leak-CD:area=leak-empty=all-CD:area-1S-DEC table-LOC
           ‘I spilt water all over the table’Some types of root repetition should be considered as reduplication, which
should probably not be confused with compounding (see also the relevant re-
mark in 7.3.5.):(3081)     'tei-hͿ-kai        aru=a'ru-tse
           one-NOM-CL:leg jump=jump-DEC
           ‘he hops on one leg’  Some verbal compounds are lexicalised. The combination of the productive
meanings of the concomitant roots leads to a less predictable meaning:(3082)     i'si=Ǌi-da-hͿ-ki                 (3083)     tsã=txi'te-da-ki

           ‘my head swims, I feel dizzy’328.It is likely that the SWR and IDS markers have a pragmatic interpretation here.

          batrise=leave-DEC       hole-LOC
          ‘the bat flew out of the hole’The use of the verb root kukui- ‘to hurt’ as an expletive particle (see 7.7.6.)
may derive from a compound, but this cannot be verified.(3086)    ku'kui nͿ-'hͿ-re
          why!       big-NOM-INT
          ‘why, it is big!’
7.4.2. Other compoundsNominal compounds are rare in Kwaza, and they are usually rather lexicalised.
Consider the following examples:(3087)    ãrǊi=eke-'e    'eke e-'he-tsy-hͿ
          tapir=horn-too horn have-NEG-GER-NOM
          ‘cow without horns’(3088)    kari=tsu'ty

          fish=bone-CL:tooth                            latex=man
          ‘fishhook’                                    ‘the latex man’ (t)Most complex nominals consist of a noun root and a classifier:(3091)    mury'cy-siki                        (3092)    ywy'nwͿ-koro
          mahogany-CL:skin                              tree-Cl:arm
          ‘bark of mahogany’                            ‘branch’If (3092) should be a compound, it would have involved the independent form
of the word for ‘arm’, tsoro. However *ywynwͿtsoro is ungrammatical. The
same holds for example (3091), where the complete form of the second mem-
ber of the compound would have been esi'ki ‘skin’.329329.One could argue that classifiers are allomorphs which apply when nouns are com-
574     7. Other morphosyntactic structures    There are also compounds of which the members belong to different catego-
ries. Notice the following compounds in which the first member is a noun, but
the second member is a semantically attributive verb root without verbal in-
flexion.(3093)      atxitxi=da'ra                             (3094)      jerexwa=txu'hǊi
            maize=green                                           jaguar=small
            ‘green maize’                                         ‘(wild) cat’ / ‘little dog’  There are compounds in which the first member is a verb, and the second
member is an adverb:(3095)      da'rje-hͿ      a-'he=danͿ-a-wy
            strong-NOM     have-NEG=still-1P-time
            ‘the time we (men) did not yet have strength’ (t)(3096)      a'rwenã=ele'le-wa-ta
            make.chicha=very-IS-CSO                                          (t)
            ‘(from now on) they (will) always make chicha (in the normal way)’(3097)      a'wͿi=a-to'to-da-ki
            see=Ø-DR:upward-1S-DEC
            ‘I looked high up there’Just like nominal compounds, these are rare, since the adverbial content would
normally be expressed by a separate preceding adverb, or by a directional mor-
pheme (see 5.3.). Nevertheless, this yields a slightly different meaning:(3098)      ãwͿi-to'to-da-ki
            see-DR:upward-1S-DEC
            ‘I looked upwards’Compounds involving adverbs (or functioning as such) were discussed more
extensively towards the end of section (6.2.3.) of the chapter on adverbs.
   On one occasion, a bound morpheme occurred in a root position, com-
pounded with a pronoun as second member:
      pounded or incorporated. However, it has been demonstrated in section (4.2.) that
      not all nouns are etymologically related to their classifiers and that not all classifiers
      are represented by full nouns. Unless one would consider those etymologically un-
      related classifiers as suppletive forms, the Kwaza classifiers should not be regarded
      as compounded or incorporated forms.
                                                       7.5. Morphological ellipsis    575(3099)     'he=ƭ
           NEG=he
           ‘not him’
7.5.   Morphological ellipsisOne of the basic characteristics of morphology is that it involves bound mor-
phemes. One of the basic properties of bound morphemes is that they do not
occur as independent words. This is confirmed by the fact that when a bound
morpheme of a certain language is presented in isolation to a bilingual native
speaker, it is very difficult for him or her to give an accurate translation if he or
she is not a linguist.330 In the present work I have analysed Kwaza as a mor-
phologically complex language, and its morphology as agglutinative. Morpho-
phonological processes are rare in Kwaza, and quite irregular. Although the
morphology seems agglutinating, the large number of grammatical morphemes
with lexical contents betrays a tendency towards polysynthesis. Notwithstand-
ing this analysis, it can be demonstrated that bound morphemes in Kwaza do
occur independently, be it only in the proper contexts. Furthermore, a number
of morphemes can be interpreted in isolation by some consultants, although the
interpretations of such morphemes may vary strongly, depending on the imag-
ined or suggested context in which they are placed. In van der Voort (2002a) I
have argued that this does not prohibit one to regard Kwaza roots and inflex-
ions as bound morphemes.331
    In this section I will discuss elliptic phenomena in Kwaza morphology. I
will not treat here the omission of overt arguments of fully inflected verbs. This
has already been dealt with in section (5.1.) on person cross-reference. Fur-
thermore, I will not discuss here the omission of overt heads of attributive con-
structions. This is mentioned in sections (4.2.1.3.), (4.3.) and (8.4.1.2.). Finally,
stylistically motivated omission of sentence constituents is not discussed in the
present work at all.
    The subject to which I refer as “ellipsis” in the present work is mainly the
omission of verbal inflexion and of roots. It occurs often in pragmatic contexts
where it is obvious to the hearer which elements are to be understood. Certain
aspects of Kwaza grammar, such as the resumptive function of independently
occurring inflexional elements must have originated from ellipsis. In the pres-
ent section I will give an overview of morphological ellipsis in Kwaza. Several
specific aspects of ellipsis were also touched upon in other places, which will
be mentioned in passing. Negation in elliptic constructions has already been
discussed separately in (7.1.1.5.). Coordination by means of an elliptic con330.Obviously, this is no less difficult for a linguist who is not a native speaker.
331.In that article I have drawn a parallel with the Eskimo languages on the basis Allen
    (1996:15;27;253). Root ellipsis and morpheme ellipsis in Inuktitut is also the topic of
    an article by Swift and Allen (2002) that came to my attention afterwards.
576    7. Other morphosyntactic structuresstruction is described in (8.5.). Few elliptic phenomena have been observed
with respect to nominal morphology. This is probably because nominal inflex-
ion in Kwaza is relatively simple in the first place.
    In subsection (7.5.1.) I will discuss the independent occurrence of verbal
roots and the omission of verbal inflexion, i.e. of person and mood markers.
Subsection (7.5.2.) concerns the independent occurrence of person and mood
markers and the omission of verbal roots. In (7.5.3.) I will treat ellipsis in
nominal morphology. In subsection (7.5.4.) it will be demonstrated how verbal
inflexional morphemes can be separated from the verb root to which they be-
long by intervening sentence constituents.","[605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614]"

                                Introduction
Kwaza is an unclassified indigenous Amazonian language that is spoken by 25
people. The speakers of Kwaza live in the indigenous reserve of Tubarão-
Latundê on the headwaters of the Apediá or Pimenta Bueno river in the South-
east of the federal Brazilian state of Rondônia. In traditional times the Kwaza
must have formed a fierce nation of a few thousand persons subdivided into
various groups. They lived in a huge area, as neighbours of the Aikanã nation
which was of similar size and structure.1 It is not known when exactly the
Kwaza met representatives of Western cultures for the first time.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]"

1.11. Organisation of the present workThis book consists of three parts: a grammar (part I), texts (part II) and a dic-
tionary (part III). It is an attempt to describe the Kwaza language. It neither
follows a specific theoretical model, nor does it examine theoretical implica-
tions of the analysis. Its primary concern is to prevent the Kwaza language
from disappearing without leaving behind representative documentation. The
description is intended to be comprehensive and dependable, so that theoretical
issues can be dealt with in later studies.
    The basic orientation of this grammar is formal rather than functional, that
is, the structure of the present description is determined by the productive
forms of the language and the way they are used, rather than by possible
grammatical functions and the way these are realised by the grammatical sys-
tem. Nevertheless, the sections are not always located where they could be ex-
pected to be on formal grounds. The subsection about classifiers (4.2.) is rele-
vant both for nominal and verbal morphology. Since classification is important
for a complete understanding of attributive modification, numerals and demon-
stratives, I have discussed it prior to these. The subsections which concern ad-
verbial affixes (6.2.4.) have been placed together, because I deemed it conven-
ient to have all adverbial morphology in one place rather than scattered
throughout the book. Finally, the chapter on complex constructions (8.) also
has a basis in verbal morphology. However, since that morphology is charac-
teristic for subordinate clauses, its grammatical domain is greater than that of
the verb alone. Therefore, I have discussed it after the sections on nouns, verbs
and adverbs. The subsections of (8.) together provide a complete account of
subordinate clause formation. If a strictly formal arrangement were followed,
the discussion of subordinate constructions would become highly fragmented.
Additionally, some minor subsections have been assigned to chapters on func-
tional grounds, such as (5.1.7.) on the impersonal use of the special verb root
jã- ‘to be’, although they are also mentioned in chapters where they belong
formally (in this case 7.6.2.).
    In the present work the subject of morpheme order has not been discussed
thoroughly. Its basic characteristics are dealt with briefly in (3.2.) as a separate
issue. Otherwise, it is only discussed in an ad hoc manner in those places where
it is of immediate importance for identification or proper understanding of a
specific morpheme, such as e.g. the negative morpheme -he- in (7.1.).
    With regard to the internal organisation of the subsections, I have striven to
discuss the most common constructions, and the examples which serve to il-
lustrate them, first, and the more exceptional ones towards the end of these
subsections.
28    1. Introduction    The examples are as much as possible in a phonemic spelling, but phonetic
variation is sometimes indicated. I found this necessary since not all questions
that concern the underlying phonological structures of Kwaza may have been
answered satisfactorily yet.34 Word boundary is symbolised by a space < > and
morpheme boundary by a hyphen <->, or, in the case of compounds (and
sometimes cliticisation), by the equation sign <=>. A dot <.> occurs between
multiple component elements of an English gloss corresponding to a single
morpheme in Kwaza. The presence of a glottal stop <?> is not indicated in
automatic positions, provided that these positions are preceded by a space, hy-
phen or equation sign (see the discussion concerning the glottal stop in 2.2.2.).
    The main stress of polysyllabic words is usually symbolised by an apostro-
phe <'> preceding the stressed syllable (see 2.8.).35 In chapter (2.) stress is only
indicated in the phonetic transcriptions, since it is not analysed as phonemic.
However, because the proposed rules of stress placement are sometimes not
consistent with stress placement in actual spontaneous data, main stress as ob-
served is always indicated in the rest of the work, even though the notation of
the glossed examples is largely phonemic. When a word contains two stress
markers it has not been possible to determine which one of them was main and
which one was secondary. Very long derived or compounded words may con-
tain several main stress positions. The precise determination of the rules with
regard to stress is a matter of future research.
    The free translations of the examples are based as directly as possible on the
Portuguese translations given of the Kwaza phrases by the consultants them-
selves. Because the notion “sentence” in Kwaza has not been thoroughly ex-
plored I have avoided the use of capitals and full stops in both the Kwaza mate-
rial and the free translations. The main exceptions to this concern proper names
and quoted utterances in the free translations.","[65, 66]"

4.7.4. Interrogative pronounThere is one interrogative pronoun: di'lİ ‘who’.(1014)   di'lİ hu'hui-re               (1015)      dilİ-'wã 'mİ̘-re

         who-POS-CL:house house                    who-BER-2-INT
         ‘whose house?’                            ‘for whom are you doing that?’A sentence can only contain one interrogative lexeme:(1020)   'peDro jere'xwa      dilİ-'wã wa'dy-re
         Pedro   jaguar       who-AO give-INT
         ‘to whom did Pedro give a dog?’150(1021)   *di'lİ jere'xwa   wa'dy-re       dilİ-'wã
         who jaguar        give-INT       who-AO

         ‘who else went with you?’There is no specific indefinite pronoun ‘(some)one’ or ‘no-one’. In
non-interrogative sentences di'lİ can be considered as an indefinite pronoun:(1024)   di'lİ 'mã-hata-kywy      ta'dy-xa-le     tso'roi=o'nİ-he-ky

         who want-GER-NOM
         ‘he who wishes’The following construction, which involves the procrastinative element -tara-
and probably the intentional form -here, does not have the antithetic sense ex-
pected in (5.5.14.1.):(1026)   di'lİ-wã-here aw're-da-tara-tse
         who-AO-INTL marry-1S-PROC-DEC
         ‘I’m going to marry someone’(1027)   di'lİ-he're 'ja-ta'ra-tse
         who-INTL eat-PROC-DEC
         ‘someone should eat this’di'lİ has the value of an indefinite negative pronoun ‘no-one’ when in argument
position of a negative predicate (see also 7.1.1.7.):(1028)   di'lİ kǊ'rǊi-dy-nãi        huda'da-hͿ 'a-hͿ-he-ki
         who Kanoê-POS-NOM          speak-NOM exist-NOM-NEG-DEC         'he-tsy-hͿ
         NEG-GER-NOM
         ‘there is no-one who speaks anything of the Kanoê language’ (t)
242   4. The noun phraseIn case of indefinite subject reference (see 5.1.4.) as in: ka'hİxuxwaki ‘they bit
you’, one cannot employ a definite subject. The interrogative pronoun can only
be combined with argument cross-reference to a definite argument:(1029)   di'lİ ka'hİ-hata-re        (*dilİ ka'hİ-xuxwa-re)
         who bite-3S.2O-INT         who bite-IS.2O-INT
         ‘who bit you?’(1030)   di'lİ 'kui-re              (*dilİ kui-wa-re)

         ‘who drank (it)?”

                             The verb phrase
Kwaza verbs can be morphologically highly complex and there are many dif-
ferent suffixes. A verb in Kwaza consists minimally of a bound root and
obligatory person and mood suffixes. Between the root and the obligatory suf-
fixes other, optional, suffixes may be inserted. The obligatory suffixes, which
can only be omitted when the speech context allows, are considered as inflex-
ional. The optional suffixes are considered as derivational. Their occurrence
depends on the specific state of affairs as described or expressed by the utter-
ance.
    The distinction between derivation and inflexion is not clear-cut. Valency
changing suffixes, aspectual suffixes, directionals and the like are optional, and
could be considered as derivational. Subject cross-reference151 markers and
mood markers are obligatory and could be considered as inflexional. Modal
suffixes and object cross-reference markers are to a certain extent optional and
they take a position inside the word between the derivational and inflexional
suffixes.
    Although I do not make an explicit and categorical formal distinction be-
tween derivational and inflexional morphemes, I do distinguish different types
of suffixes on the basis of an intuitive notion of the distinction. This is reflected
in the order by which the verbal morphemes will be treated in the subsequent
sections. First I will discuss the most inflexional of the suffixes, the person
cross-reference markers, in (5.1.). Mood (i.e. illocution) markers, which can
also be considered as inflexional, are discussed in (5.2.). Then, more deriva-
tional-like morphemes are discussed, such as directional morphemes in (5.3.),
valency changing suffixes in (5.4.), tense, modality and aspect morphemes in
(5.5.) and nominalisers in (5.6.).
    Even though negation in Kwaza can be considered as a verbal derivational
process, I have, because of its special formal and pragmatic characteristics,
relegated it to (7.1.).
    I regard those roots as verbal which are morphologically bound. From the
point of view of morphology, Kwaza verbs are not complete words if a nomi-
naliser, or person and mood marking is absent. In essence, “incomplete” stems
are not well-formed in Kwaza. Nevertheless, ellipsis of person and mood
marking occurs in certain contexts. This is discussed in another chapter, in
(7.5.).
    Semantically, verbal roots are either attributive or predicative. Kwaza verb
roots contrast morphologically with noun roots in that Kwaza nouns can occur151.In this work I have used the term “cross-reference” as in Shopen (1985) in the sense
    of “agreement” or “concord”.
244    5. The verb phraseby themselves. This morphological property of Kwaza nouns is related to their
referential meaning. Kwaza nouns are basically referring expressions. They can
also be used without morphological adaptation as attributive expressions, and,
when zero-verbalised as verb stems, they function as predicative expressions
(see 4.4.9.). Kwaza verbs may remain inflected for person under nominalisa-
tion.","[278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"

8.3.1.8. Some morphosyntactic aspects of cosubordinationThe linear order of cosubordinated clauses does not seem to be so strict that the
matrix clause always has to follow the medial clause. Compare example (3473)
to the following:(3529)    dodotxi'te ohui-'nã-tja        o'ja-tse
          ball         play-FUT-CSO leave-DEC
          ‘he went there to play ball’381According to the consultant, there was no meaning difference between the al-
ternative orders. In the following examples, the order is iconic:381.Alternative order: 312.

         snake     circle-CL:eye-DEC moon-AO swallow-want-CSO
         ‘snake is encircling the moon in order to swallow it’(3531)   'makina dai-'nã-tse        awͿi-ja-'nã-tja
         camera grab-FUT-DEC see-IO-FUT-CSO
         ‘he is going to take/find his camera in order to take a picture’In many examples the order encountered was not subjected to a requirement of
iconicity. Also, the question of which verb should represent the matrix predi-
cate and which verb the cosubordinated predicate is not always easy to solve.(3532)   (ui)     hu-'nã-tja        'İ-ki
         tobacco smoke-FUT-CSO go-DEC
         ‘she went (home) to smoke a cigarette’(3533)   'İ-tja   'hu-ki
         go-CSO smoke-DEC
         ‘she went (home) and is smoking’The medial clause example (3532) has a purposive function due to the Future
marker -nã-, whereas example (3533) just sums up the subsequent events in an
iconic order. The next example is structurally a blend of the above examples:(3534)   'İ-da-ta     here?etje-hͿ-'nã-da-ki
         go-1S-CSO rest-NOM-FUT-1S-DEC
         ‘I’ll go away and relax’In this example, the order is iconic and the function of one of the clauses may
be purposive. However, the consultant MA explained that the reverse order
*here?etje-'nã-da-ta İ-da-ki would make no sense as “it is the wrong way
round”, even though it corresponds structurally to (3532). There is no pur-
posive sense involved in the next iconically ordered sentence:(3535)   tͅjã'wã-ki awe-'nã-tja
         dark-DEC rain-FUT-CSO
         ‘it is getting dark; it will rain’No systematic (field) research on constituent order was done, and the issue will
not be pursued any further here.
668   8. Subordination and coordination8.3.1.9. Lengthy medial clause chains and discourse particlesIn elicited cosubordinative constructions there is usually a matrix verb in the
declarative mood which comes at the end of the clause chain. In running texts
there is usually no concluding matrix verb. Matrix verb mood forms are then
mostly used to indicate quoted speech. However, traditional and mythological
tales usually do end in a formula bearing the declarative mood form -ki. Proba-
bly, the entire story can be regarded as a long clause chain, terminated by a
symbolic matrix clause. The majority of the texts in part (II) of the present
work are structured and terminated like this. The following text excerpt con-
tains a lengthy clause chain:(3536)   eto'hoi-nahere-wã       hͿ'dİ ja-Ϳ-'rjͿ      kari'cwa-na
         child-COL-AO            go! DIST-ATT-CD:area field-LOC         'İ-a-ta   'a-a-ta                atxi'txi   mani'ni-tsy-hͿ
         go-1P-CSO exist-1P-CSO           maize      fish-GER-NOM         hu'de-a-ta 'ja-a-ta         a-a-'ni=tja         'ta-ta
         dry-1P-CSO eat-1P-CSO exist-1P-EXH=CSO talk-CSO
         ‘“let’s go there to the old field, we go there, we’ll live there, we’ll dry
         and eat maize and fish, let’s live there!” she said, speaking to her
         children’ (t)In this example, the first four medial clauses are subordinated to an exhortative
matrix clause. That matrix clause represents quoted speech and is embedded in
a medial clause, which again is cosubordinated with another medial clause and
an implicit matrix clause. The story from which this excerpt is taken ends fi-
nally with the declarative verb ta-ki ‘she said’ and is followed by the formula
cwa-rati-ki ‘that is what they say’. All the other matrix mood clauses in the
story represent quoted speech.
    The attachment of a cosubordinative morpheme to a fully inflected clause
such as the exhortative in (3536) or the volitive in (3537), represents the mor-
phological operation of cliticisation which occurs especially in quoted speech
constructions:(3537)   cutİ-da-'mͿ=tja
         fell-1S-VOL=CSO
         ‘“I’m going to fell trees”, he said’ (t)In such constructions, it may occur that the cliticised cosubordination mor-
pheme is preceded by a small pause as if it represents an independent word or
particle. Narratives are filled with such particles and it is possible to discuss
their meaning with the consultants. One consultant (TE) said that -tja is used
“only when telling a story you know that happened or which you witnessed
                                          8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses   669someone else tell”.382 He translated -tja as ‘he thought’, cwahͿ as ‘they
thought’ and cwata as ‘they thought’ or ‘they said’. Sometimes such particles
are translated as if they are pronouns. E.g. tja has been translated as ‘he’. On
another occasion -tja was translated as ‘yes’. About cwa(ta) it was said that it
is used “when one retells what someone else told, but you don’t know the ori-
gin of the story”.383 If one were aware of their reported speech function, one
would easily analyse some free occurrences of such morphemes as pronominal:(3538)    tja    'İ-ki
          CSO    go-DEC
          ‘he said thus, and went away’In fact, these particles can be used as resumptive morphemes and they can even
be inflected for person. As an example, the first person cosubordinative form
-data is, as a particle, translated by consultants both as ‘I said’ or as ‘well, then
I ...’:384(3539)    e'nãi-tja-ta-tsy-'tse      da-ta     areta-'nã-da-ki
          quarrel-TRA-1O-POT-DEC 1S-CSO know-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘he is going to quarrel with me, so I, I’m going to learn’    It is unlikely that the verb root ta- ‘to talk’ originates from a reinterpreted
cosubordinative mood marker -ta. However, the element tja- in the verb root
tjata- ‘to say to someone’ may very well be:(3540)    ti-'nãi-tsy-re        mã       ta-dy-'ta
          what-like-that.be-INT mother talk-DS-CSO
          ‘“where is your mother?” he said to him’ (t)(3541)    xa-'he-tsy-tse       İ-'ra      mã        cari-hata-'tsi=tja

          talk-NOM=but
          ‘“don’t you persist, go away!, lest your mother will kill you” she said,
          however (unfortunately)...’ (t)Reported speech cliticisation and ellipsis are discussed more thoroughly in
(5.5.11.1.) and (7.5.2.3.).382.'só contando que você sabe ou que viu a pessoa contando'
383.'recontando que outro falou, mas você não conhece o dono da historia'
384.'aí eu', 'falei'
670    8. Subordination and coordination8.3.1.10. Coordination through cosubordinationKwaza does not have true coordinating conjunctions (see also 8.5.). Juxtaposi-
tion of two subsequent matrix clauses simply represents two separate sen-
tences, and not two coordinated clauses within one sentence:(3542)     hary'ky ja          ja=hã'rã-da-ki      nǊ'ri-da-ki
           now       already eat=stop-1S-DEC satiate-1S-DEC
           ‘I already stopped eating, I’m full’385Note that juxtaposed matrix clauses may function as complement clauses in
semantic respects and that the subjects do not have to be identical:(3543)     hã'te-ra     ti-'nãi-tja          Ǌ'nã-re
           count-IMP what-NOM-CSO            long-INT
           ‘try what length it has (i.e. measure it)!’(3544)     dyte'nã-a-ni            wãwͿi-wa-ni
           extinguish-1P-EXH       sleep-IS-EXH
           ‘let’s extinguish the candle so they can get some sleep!’However, consecutiveness of events is usually expressed through medial and
matrix clauses which together constitute a subordinating rather than a coordi-
nating construction. Nevertheless, the translations offered by the consultant of
several of the examples in the present chapter, such as (3469), (3484), (3500),
(3507) and (3555), suggest that medial clauses function as coordinated clauses.
    As explained in (4.3.) Kwaza does not possess the category of adjectives but
it has verb roots with an attributive content. When verbs based on semantically
attributive roots are cosubordinated, they have the translation value of coordi-
nated adjectives:(3545)     mangka-'to        hoi-'tja     tãi-'he-tse
           mango-CL:fruit    sweet-CSO tough-NEG-DEC
           ‘the mangoes are sweet and soft’   Coordination of nouns can be realised through juxtaposition of bare nouns
(see also 8.5.):(3546)     meza-'na      kore'ja di'hu-tse
           table-LOC knife          spoon-DEC
           ‘on the table there is a knife and a spoon’
385.*hary'ky ja'jahã'rãda'ta nu'ridaki was considered “wrong” by MA, just as *hary'ky
    ja'jahã'rãdaki nu'rida'ta, about which MA said “it is like writing from back to front”.
                                       8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses   671However, the cosubordinating morpheme -t(j)a is also employed in construc-
tions containing coordinated nominals:(3547)   meza-'na      kore'ja-tja di'hu-tse
         table-LOC knife-CSO spoon-DEC
         ‘on the table there is a knife and a spoon’The words koreja ‘knife’ and dihu ‘spoon’ are nouns. In this example both
nouns are verbalised and cosubordinated. The literal translation could be: ‘on
the table being a knife, there is a spoon’. The following example suggests that
the entire verbalised cosubordinated construction can function as the argument
of a matrix verb, as if it were a complex noun:(3548)   kaiku'cİ̘-tja  arikwã'jǊ-tse hanã'wã-na          'a-ki
         KaikucİҔ-CSO ArikwãjǊ-DEC heaven-LOC             exist-DEC
         ‘ArikwãjǊ and KaikucİҔ live in heaven’Maybe the whole utterance should be regarded as bisentential, translated liter-
ally as: ‘they are ArikwãjǊ and KaikucİҔ, they live in heaven’. A partially simi-
lar construction was attested with the comitative morpheme -dynͿ, which is a
purely nominal suffix:(3549)   hyriko'ro-xwanã-tja     atxitxi'?Ǌ-tja hari?i'xu-dynͿ 'ja-da -ki
         monkey-CL:flesh-CSO     rice-CSO         bean-COMIT   eat-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m eating monkey meat, rice and beans’   Numerals are also easily used as verb stems. Complex numerals may be ex-
pressed as a cosubordinated verbalised construction:(3550)   bwa-ko'je-tja   aky-'hͿ-tse
         end-CL:hand-CSO two-NOM-DEC
         ‘(it is) seven’(3551)   tei-'hͿ-tja      a-'he-tse koreja'ri
         one-NOM-CSO exist-NEG-DEC plate
         ‘one plate is lacking’(3552)   aky-'hͿ      e'ma-tja     a-'he-tse     koreja'ri
         two-NOM more-CSO          exist-NEG-DEC plate
         ‘we lack 3 plates’
672   8. Subordination and coordination8.3.2. Different subject medial clauses and switch referenceSection (8.3.1.) concerns same subject medial clauses. In (8.3.1.1.) the similar-
ity of subjects in the medial clause and the matrix clause was explicitly touched
upon. In the present section it will be shown that Kwaza deals with dissimilar-
ity of subjects in a grammaticalised manner which can be referred to as switch
reference. Kwaza has two formally distinct ways to indicate that the subject of
the cosubordinated verb is different from the subject of another cosubordinated
or a superordinated verb. The first way is by an extension of the same subject
medial clause verb with the element -dy- preceding the cosubordination
marker. This element indicates that the subject of the next verb is a different
third person than the third person subject of the verb to which it is currently
attached. The second way is a switch reference cosubordinate mood form in -si
which yields a different subject medial clause. This element is used when one
of the concomitant clauses in a cosubordination construction has a third person
subject while the other one has a non-third person subject. In the following ta-
ble the medial clause markers are categorised with regard to the coreference
possibilities of their subjects:Table 33. Medial clause markers and switch reference
                                  SS                             DS
CSO                              -t(j)a                        -dy-ta
SWR                                 -                            -si
8.3.2.1. Different subjects in cosubordination: -dy-The subject of a medial clause ending in -ta is usually identical with the subject
of the matrix clause. This is signalled clearly by overt person coreference
marking. In the case of a third person subject, there is zero cross-reference. If
necessary, it is possible to indicate morphologically via the element -dy- that
the third person of the medial clause is different from the third person of the
matrix clause. It must be mentioned that such an overt indication of different
subjects is not obligatory when the medial clause functions as an adverbial
clause. In the following example, the absence of a formal expression of differ-
ence between medial and matrix clause third person subjects does not lead to
ambiguity:(3553)    txu'hǊi-tja a'we-tse
          small-CSO rain-DEC
          ‘it rained a little’
                                           8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses      673This type of adverbial clause was discussed in (8.2.6. and 8.3.1.7.). Its behav-
iour with regard to subject (dis)continuity is a reason to consider this construc-
tion as subordinate rather than cosubordinate.
   In the subsequent examples the cosubordinated clauses do not function as
adverbials or complements of the matrix clauses. They are proper medial
clauses, but their third person subjects are identical to those of the matrix
clause:(3554)    ã'rǊi are-'nͿ-tja      o'ja-ki
          tapir turn-REF-CSO leave-DEC
          ‘he turned himself into a tapir and went away’(3555)    zjwãu      o'nİ-tja     ca'ri=asa-hͿ-ki               peDro-'wã

          ‘João entered and gave the bag (POR bolsa) to Txi?a’In the case of different third person subjects the medial verb is first extended by
a different subject marker -dy- before the cosubordinative morpheme is at-
tached. Compare these examples with the preceding ones:(3559)    zjwãu o'nİ-hͿ-dy-ta             'peDro     ca'ri=asa-hͿ-ki

386.The verb ojatse ‘he left’ would have been unpragmatical as a matrix verb here.

   ‘the women made him turn into a tapir, he went away, they went home’Apparently, the element -dy- signals a switch between the subject of the present
subordinate clause and the next one. My teacher MA explained it in the fol-
lowing manner: -dy- is a necessary element to “separate” the different agents in
one sentence, because without it “they get mixed up”.387
8.3.2.1.1. Different subject marking in other subordinate clausesDifferent subject marking may not be restricted to medial clauses alone. In

4.1.1.9. Concluding remarksIn conclusion, we can say that objects of transitive verbs tend to be case
marked in the first place because they belong to the animate category. When
they are inanimate, case marking is ungrammatical. From a formal point of
view, case marking is not strictly necessary in order to distinguish between the
subject and the object, because the subject is identified by cross-reference
marking on the verb. However, if all arguments are third persons there is room
for ambiguity. In the absence of case marking, if both subject and object are
animate third persons, there would be no way to know on the basis of the syn-
tax alone which would be what. From a pragmatic point of view, the absence of
case marking generally does not create ambiguity when the verbal object is in-
animate. The same holds for indirect objects of semantically ditransitive verbs:
it is usually people who give things to living beings. So, if the case marker -wã
were an animacy marker alone, the disambiguation function would be an auto-
matic side effect. Nevertheless, it is essential when the arguments of transitive
verbs are equal in animacy and person. Therefore -wã is bifunctional: it serves
to mark both animacy and objecthood. At the same time, it reflects the much
attested pragmatically based tendency to prefer to give subject function to ani-
mate beings (see e.g. Comrie 1989:128). From the contrast between certain
verbs, remember the pair (106) and (107), it appears also that in the grammar of
Kwaza, human beings are higher on the animacy hierarchy than non-human
animate beings.
    The occurrence of -wã on inanimate nouns, as in (197), is not understood in
the light of the present analysis.
    For some verbs no information was obtained regarding the question whether
animate object marking is optional, obligatory or ungrammatical:(199) dilİ-'wã oi'tsi-tsy-hͿ-'re              (200) ã'rǊi-wã 'mǊ-ki

5.1.8. Future second person object cross-referenceThere is one transitive cross-reference morpheme which has a future meaning,
the portmanteau morpheme -leja- ‘(2O.FUT)’. This morpheme replaces the pro-
ductive future morpheme -nã- and the second person object morpheme -nƭnã-.
This is the only cross-reference morpheme of its kind, and there is no para-
digm.(1234)    ui         kurje=wa'dy-nƭnã-da-ki

pressed analytically, that is, by the morpheme -nã- and synthetically, i.e. as un-
analysable part of -leja-:(1242)    wady-'nã-hata-ki                (1243)    ba'baice-ete-le'ja-tse

          ‘he/they are going to give                ‘He wants to dance with you’
          (something) to you’Note that -leja- resembles -nã- in that it cannot be immediately succeeded by
the declarative marker -ki. When no other morphemes intervene -tse is used.
   With non-second person objects the future is always expressed analytically:(1244)    a'we tsoihͿ-le'ja-tse        (1245)       a'we tsoi'hͿ-nã-ta-ki

it can not be denied that the element -le- does resemble the reciprocal mor-
pheme -lİ- ‘each other’, and -ja- resembles indefinite object -ja-, one connota-
tion of which, as seen in (5.1.4.3.), is first person inclusive object.(1252)   pİ̘rİ̘'jã-tja-da-ta oja'nͿ-da-ki

         speak-TRA-2O.FUT-1S-CSO arrive-1S-DEC
         ‘I came here to talk with you’Some examples even suggest interaction between interpretations of -leja- and
(semantic) categories of indefiniteness and inclusivity of the object. With re-
spect to indefiniteness, the morpheme sometimes appears to generalise over
second and third person of object in example (1244) and:(1255)   do-'hͿ-le'ja-da-ki
         leak-NOM-2O.FUT-1S-DEC
         ‘I am going to pour water over you/him’As far as possible inclusivity of objects is concerned, the morpheme conspicu-
ously disallows an inclusive subject in:(1256)   huhui-le'ja-a-xa-ki        (*hu'hui-le'ja-a-ki)
         kill-2O.FUT-1P-AS-DEC
         ‘we are going to kill you’If there is a relation between the future object and the reciprocal and indefinite
object morphemes, it is probably of an etymological nature, i.e. it is lexicalised
at the most and certainly not fully productive and predictable.
                                                                     5.2. Mood     2835.2.   MoodMood is obligatorily expressed by a verb-final morpheme. Kwaza has four in-
dependent basic moods for the sentential matrix verb: declarative, marked by
-ki or -tse; interrogative, marked by -re; and persuasive and prohibitive. The
persuasive is further divided into three sub-moods, depending on the person in-
volved: imperative, marked by -ra for second persons; exhortative-causative,
marked by -ni for first inclusive and third persons; and volitive, marked by -mͿ
for other first persons. The prohibitive is also divided into three sub-moods:
negative imperative, marked by -ky-; negative exhortative, marked by -(i)ni;
and monitory, marked by -tsi.
    Cosubordinated sentences are not overtly marked for these moods, but they
basically get a verb-final general cosubordinate marker -ta or -si the modal
content of which is often determined by the mood of the matrix verb. Cosubor-
dination is discussed in (8.3.). The “mood” markers of adverbial clauses will be
discussed in (8.2.).
    It is important to note that without any further morphological or lexical op-
erations, the default tense interpretation of the verb root which is inflected for
person and declarative mood is ambiguous between present and anterior to the
moment of speaking:(1257)    o'nİ-ki
          arrive-DEC
          ‘he arrives / he arrived’Although the default interpretation of the interrogative is also potentially both
present and anterior, there is a stronger tendency for it to be present tense.
    In this section, all moods are discussed. Interaction between mood and per-
son marking is discussed where it applies. Some moods other than the declara-
tive require person markers which deviate slightly from the situation sketched
in section (5.1.). They were not dealt with in that section because they are de-
pendent on certain specific moods.
    Eight basic mood marking morphemes were identified in Kwaza. In the pre-
sent section they will be treated in the same order as they appear in the follow-
ing table.172
172.Mood in subordinated verbs is discussed in section (8.2.) on adverbial clauses, and
    mood in cosubordinated verbs in section (8.3.) on medial clauses.

5.2.1. Declarativeki ‘DEC’. The declarative mood marker -ki is the form normally encountered in
(elicited) declarative sentences. It is fully productive with all subject and object
persons. The zero-marked third person form is usually the citation (translation)
form of an isolated verb.(1258)    'mã-Ø-ki
          call-3-DEC
          ‘he/she/it/they call/called’In elicited complex sentences, declarative cosubordinated verb phrases are in
the cosubordinative “mood” (see 8.3.), whereas the last word of the sentence is
usually the matrix verb ending in declarative -ki:(1259)    'e-wa-ta     'hu-wa-ki
          leave-IS-CSO smoke-IS-DEC
          ‘(she) went (home and is) smoking’In running text the declarative is rare. It is often used for directly quoted pas-
sages within a narrative:(1260)    duky'hͿ kuja'?u       kukui'hͿ-da-ki ƭ'wã-tja
          other     Curiangu ill-1S-DEC         nothing-CSO
          ‘another (man called) Curiangu said “I’m ill” but it was a lie’ (t)In running text most “sentences”, including the declarative, are normally in the
cosubordinative mood. Such texts, usually traditional tales, are often finished
by a verbal formula with a declarative mood ending -ki, as if the whole pre-
ceding text was one long complex sentence, symbolically ending with a matrix
verb form:
                                                                    5.2. Mood    285(1261)    duky'hͿ ehͿ-'si  hary'ky eto'hoi            a-'wy         duky'hͿ

of joking or irony had to be offered. It was never easy to avoid being given the
pragmatically more usual imperative or interrogative forms.tse ‘DEC’. There is an alternative declarative ending -tse, which is often pro-
nounced as [tsİ]. It is hard to determine what the fundamental difference is
between the declarative in -tse and the declarative in -ki. Sometimes they be-
have as if they are mutually interchangeable:(1262)    'wy-ki        / 'wy-tse           (1263)    'kwİ-ki      /    'kwİ-tse
          wind-DEC         wind-DEC                   enter-DEC         enter-DEC
          ‘(leaves) are rustling (in the wind)’       ‘he entered’Verbs in the -tse declarative are basically equivalent to those in the declarative
in -ki. They are matrix verbs which can take cosubordinate clauses in the co-
subordinative mood:(1264)    mangka-'to     hoi-'tja     tãi-'he-tse
          mango-CL:fruit sweet-CSO tough-NEG-DEC
          ‘the mangoes are sweet and soft’
5.2.1.1. Distributional characteristics of -tse vs. -kiThere are some important morphologically determined systematic differences
in the distribution of -ki and -tse. -ki may occur with all persons and without
any further adaptation of the verb root. -tse can only occur with the zero-
marked third person subject (and object), and cannot be combined with an im-
mediately preceding overt person marker:(1265)    'kwİ-da-ki (*'kwİdatse)           (1266)    'kwİ-wa-ki (*'kwİwatse)
          enter-1S-DEC                                enter-IS-DEC
          ‘I entered’                                 ‘someone entered’
286    5. The verb phraseWhen following overt person markers, including indefinite and impersonal,
other morphemes have to intervene between -tse and the person marker. In the
following example, the potential aspect marker -tsy- occurs between the person
and mood markers:(1267)    'kwİ-da-tsy-tsİ  (*'kwİdatsyki)
          enter-1S-POT-DEC
          ‘I will enter’So -tse can be combined with overt person markers inside one verb, but it is in
principle never adjacent to them.173
   A related morphological condition on the distribution of the declarative
markers is found in the fact that certain morphemes such as the said -tsy- ‘(po-
tential)’, -tara- ‘(procrastinative)’ and -'nã- ‘(future)’ disallow the occurrence
of an immediately subsequent -ki, and require -tse (and see also 5.2.1.5.):(1268)    ja-da-ta'ra-tsİ  (*jadata'raki)
          eat-1S-PROC-DEC
          ‘I’ll eat later’In contrast, there are also derivational morphemes which never precede -tse,
even when there is no overt person marker, such as the attributive -Ϳ-:(1269)    hare'tİ-Ϳ-ki (*haretİ?Ϳtse)
          bald-ATT-DEC
          ‘he is bald’   When overt person marking intervenes between a derivational morpheme
and the declarative, the -ki declarative is required. Note, for example, that fu-
ture -nã-, which only combines with the -tse declarative, is homophonous with
the impersonal cross-reference marker -nã- ‘one’. The consultant once sug-
gested that in order to preserve the distinction between these morphemes dif-
ferent declarative markers are required:(1270)    kui-'nã-tse      (*kui'nãki)        (1271)    'kui-nã-ki (*'kuinãtse)
          drink-FUT-DEC                                 drink-one-DEC
          ‘he is going to drink’                        ‘we are drinking/one drank’(1272)    kui-'nã-da-ki (*kui'nãdatse)
          drink-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I am going to drink’173.The only cross-reference morpheme that does seem to be allowed in a position im-
    mediately adjacent to -tse is the indefinite object morpheme -ja-. This was attested
    twice, in examples (1177) and (1198) in (5.1.4.2-3.).
                                                                 5.2. Mood   287Observe that the placement of stress in the above examples also goes to mark
the distinction. The future morpheme -'nã- attracts stress whereas argument
cross-reference markers do not bear stress. The negative morpheme -he- is an-
other morpheme which attracts stress. When no overt person marking inter-
venes, the usual declarative to be combined with negative -he- is -tse. But when
-he- does occur with -ki, stress placement is different:(1273)   dehemǊte-'he-tse                  (1274)   dehemǊ'te-he-ki
         spirits-NEG-DEC                            spirits-NEG-DEC
         ‘it isn’t spirits’                         ‘it isn’t spirits’Example (1273) represents a canonical negative construction, whereas example
(1274) represents a counter of presupposition. The difference between these
constructions is explained in (7.1.1.).174
   My first conclusion is that the distinction between both declaratives is in
part a strictly formal affair. Some morphemes seem to disallow one specific
subsequent declarative marker, whereas other morphemes require one. Also,
the distinction has a morphophonological expression in differences in stress
placement.","[318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325]"

6.2.2. Reduplication in adverbsAdverbs can be extended by full repetition of the adverbial root (see also
7.3.1.). The semantic effect is emphasis or intensification of the meaning origi-

         ‘aim right!’, ‘look well!’Reduplication of an adverb can also have a repetitive effect:(2641)   haja-ha'ja
         day-day
         ‘every day’This is not possible with similar temporal adverbs: *hakorehakore.
   Partial reduplication of the adverb txarwa ‘first, now, today’ may go to-
gether with the intensifying suffix -te. Compare the following examples:(2642)   txa'rwa 'a-da-hͿ-ki                 Ϳ-hͿ-'ko

low. The partial reduplication in haja'jadyko're ‘tomorrow early’ was discussed
under (2606).
   Some adverbs were only attested in a partially reduplicated form, such as
harehareja'wyle ‘(only) after a (long) time’ or ‘just a little while later’:(2644)   sa'mweu aha-tja'te-dynͿ           'a=a-ta

         ‘Samuel lived together with his parents until he found a place of his
         own’The root of this adverb harejawy, in which the suffix -wy ‘time’ can be dis-
cerned, was translated by the consultant as ‘late, slow, belated, retarded’ but it
was not considered as an independent word. However, the element -le, which
probably means ‘only, just’ here, was omitted in one instance, and the redupli-
cation involved an even smaller part of the root:(2645)   harereja'wy     tsa'si-ki
         long.while      follow-DEC
         ‘it took him long to come’, ‘he is the last one’
6.2.3. Other categories used as adverbsFor other categories to function as adverbs, specific morphological operations
are usually required. As is demonstrated elsewhere (4.4.9.), the possibilities of
zero-derivation in Kwaza allow for many lexical roots to be ambiguous with
regard to their grammatical category. However, there is only a very small num-
ber of adverbs which are ambiguous in this respect. Some words used as ad-
verbs may actually be nouns, for example because they end in a classifier.
Other words used as adverbs may be uninflected verb roots but their original
status is difficult to prove.
    Some bare nouns have been attested to function as adverbs, e.g. teja ‘(oppo-
site) side of a place (river, settlement, road)’:(2646)   'si-dy-hͿ te'ja     (2647)    na-ay-xu'ko         te'ja 'a-ki
         I-POS-NOM side                PROX-that-SETT      side exist-DEC
         ‘my side’                     ‘he lives on the same side of the river’

         ‘we started on the side/part/region of Barroso’ (t)If teja would function as a locative satellite, it would have been marked with
the locative morpheme -na. As this is not the case, and because teja is clearly
not an argument of the verb, its function may be considered as adverbial in
these examples.
    The noun kohͿtİ ‘thing without (something)’ is a classified nominalisation
of the verb root ko- ‘to be without (something)’. It is regarded as a noun in the
present analysis, but in the following construction it may be regarded as having
both a nominal argument function and an adverbial modification function:(2650)   wa'txi ko-hͿ-'tİ                  kui-'nã-tsy-re
         true       without-NOM-NOM        drink-FUT-GER-INT
         ‘is he really going to drink (coffee) without (sugar)?’In the next example there is no doubt that kohͿtİ functions as an adverb, or,
rather, the head of an adverbial clause:(2651)   ma'telu ko-hͿ-'tİ                   hu'hui-da-ki
         hammer without-NOM-NOM              beat-1S-DEC
         ‘I hit him without a hammer’The adverbial in (2651) has a negative instrumental sense, and cannot be inter-
preted as an argument in the form of a relative clause, like ‘I hit him who was
without a hammer’.
   Although the origin of the root of the apparent adverb dako'ro ‘left’ is un-
clear, its extension -koro ‘arm’ is otherwise a productive classifier. The proper
use of this adverb is not well documented, but the following example shows
that it cannot function as an adjective, though other nouns normally do:(2652)   *dako'ro     e'cǊi
         left         eye
         ‘left eye’   Other adverbs ending in classifiers are based on nominal roots but they
contain directionals such as -rja- ‘rim’ (see 5.3.3.) in the following examples:
                                                     6.2. Adverbial morphology     503(2653)    mãreri'tsa a'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki     xyi-dy-rja-'xy

          ‘he hid himself behind a tree’If these nouns would not function as adverbs, but as locative arguments of the
verb, they would have been marked with locative case. These adverbs do not
differ structurally from those discussed in (6.2.1.), which are based on the
empty adverbial root a- and which contain directionals and which end in a clas-
sifier, such as e.g. (2625).
    Demonstratives and question roots ending in the classifier -rjͿ ‘area’ are
considered as nouns in the present analysis.282 Although they often function as
locative objects, they do not usually bear the corresponding locative or instru-
mental case marker. Hence, their use can be considered as adverbial:(2655)    (ja-)Ϳ-'rjͿ        oja-'ra
          DIST-this-CD:area  go-IMP
          ‘you have to go there!’(2656)    ti-'rjͿ        İ-'nã-xa-re             Ba'hoso-na      İ-'nã-da-ki

          Q: ‘where are you going?’              A: ‘I’m going to Barroso’Some instances were attested where other constructions terminated by -rjͿ did
not allow the locative case either.(2657)    ze'zƭju-dy-rjͿ(*-nã)         co-'hͿ a-'ki kuraku'ra
          Zezinho-POS-CD:area(-LOC) many-NOM exist-DECchicken
          ‘there are many chickens at Zezinho’s’Nevertheless, similar instances were attested in (4.6.3.) where the locative case
marker was allowed.
   Also demonstratives ending in -(xu)ko may function as adverbs (see the ex-
amples in 4.6.3.).
   Because independent stems of whatever categorial status can be easily zero-
verbalised, it is not entirely certain whether the adverbs discussed in the fol-
lowing are originally verb roots or whether their possible use as verb roots is
the result of productive verbalisation. The root of the verb habui-ki ‘it is out-
side of the house’ is used as an adverb in the following example:282.The hypothesis that these words are nouns is corroborated by many data presented in
    section (4.6.) on demonstratives and section (4.2.) on classifiers.

           ‘I saw a shoe outside’ (neutral as to position of S, cf. (2635))283    A similar dilemma exists for the adverb or verb root tja?a'tje ‘close’. The
following examples show its use respectively as a verb stem, as a nominalised
attributivisation, as an adverbial modifier of the verbal stem of a noun and as
an adverb:(2660)     tja?a'tje-tse              (2661)     tja?a'tje-Ϳ-hͿ

as a verbal root:(2664)     txu'hǊi-tse (*txu'hǊiki)         (2665)     'kui-da-hͿ       txu'hǊi-tse

parently it may occur as a second element in a verb compound:(2675)    wai=txu'hǊi-tse                   (2676)      nͿ-hͿ=txu'hǊi-tse

          ‘I’m going to visit people a little’          ‘nearly killed (him)’Although compounds in Kwaza usually only involve verb stems, this seems a
rather illegitimate criterion for regarding txuhǊi as a verb root, since txuhǊi is
also attested as a noun modifier in a construction that is probably a nominal
compound:(2679)    jerexwa=txu'hǊi                   jere'xwa-tohoi

          I-POS-NOM cord=little
          ‘my piece of rope’    Canonical verb compounding in Kwaza may create serial verb-like con-
structions (see 7.4.1.). Depending on the semantic contents of the verb roots in-
volved, compounding can have an adverbial effect. In the following examples,
the first element in the compound is the attributive verbal root darje- ‘to be
strong, quick’:(2681)    darje=hyhy'rwa-ki                 (2682)      da'rje=ja-ra

506   6. Adverbs and adverbial expressionsHowever, note that darje- may also be used as an adverb:(2683)    hyhy'rwa-da-mͿ darje
          move-1S-VOL         strong
          ‘I want to walk fast’In the present analysis, darje- is regarded as compounded because it also oc-
curs as a single inflected verb root, and because no distributional variation as as
wide as with txuhǊi was observed, like in (2680).
   The verb root takaisa- ‘traverse, divide’ was also encountered as an adverb:(2684)    ze'zƭju Ǌtİ'ja takai'sa 'a-ki
          Zezinho side traverse exist-DEC
          ‘Zezinho lives on the other side of the river’(2685)    aruu-'nã-da-ki     Ǌtİ'ja takai'sa
          cross-FUT-1S-DEC side traverse
          ‘I’m going to cross to the other side’One could argue that takaisa- is the first element of a verbal compound in
(2684), but this is impossible in (2685). In both examples it could be the second
element in a compound with the noun Ǌtİja ‘(opposite) side of an object (head,
body, house)’. However, noun-verb compounds are very rare, if they exist at
all.
     The verb stem acwadyhͿ- ‘to force (someone to do something)’ looks as if it
contains bound morphemes. Indeed, the element -dy- is causative and can be
preceded by reflexive -nͿ-, if necessary. However, the nominaliser -hͿ- is
obligatory and the root does not occur as a verb stem itself: *acwa-ki. In order
to modify the matrix verb in a complete sentence acwadyhͿ- does usually not
occur as a subordinate clause, but it is simply not inflected, and acts as an ad-
verb:(2686)    zjwãu samwe-'wã a'cwadyhͿ mǊi-'dy-ki
          João Samuel-AO force           submerge-CAU-DEC

          force.REF      submerge-1S-DEC
          ‘I’m fetching water under coercion’It is hard to say whether acwadyhͿ in this construction is a noun, an adverb or a
compounded verb root.

as adverbs. Classifiers are not considered as adverbialisers because their adver-
bial function is very marginal in comparison to their nominal function. Other
morphemes have a more predominantly adverbialising function.","[538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545]"
"
116.But note that this example is unreliable. The -Ϳ- was actually pronounced without
    nasalisation, and may have represented -a- here, which would in the same position
    function as a sort infinitive. Furthermore, the word was recorded outside of its proper
    pragmatic context, for which reason it is impossible to establish any attributive
    meaning.
192   4. The noun phrase   The morpheme -Ϳ- is also ambivalent in that, in addition to being used with
verbs, it can be applied to nouns or nominalised verbs:(741) o'wy-Ϳ-ki                            (742) 'tswa-Ϳ-hͿ

marker of a prepositional object in:

      pan-LOC-ATT-NOM begin-CSO water shed-DEC
      ‘water began to leak from the pan’117The application of -Ϳ- to demonstrative stems will be shown in (4.6.) below.
The ambivalence demonstrated above of -Ϳ- towards the root to which it is suf-
fixed is not very surprising. Kwaza nouns and adverbs can easily be turned into
verbs by simply adding a verbal suffix, like e.g. the declarative -tse in:(753) hoiele'le-tse
      batvery-DEC
      ‘there are many bats’The primary root of the following example is a verb. The application of the
classifier -tu ‘back’ yields a noun meaning ‘slope’, which can also be used as
an adverbial compound in certain constructions.(754) tewe-'tu-Ϳ-he-tse
      slant-CL:back-ATT-NEG-DEC
      ‘it is not slanting’ (there is no word for *’horizontal’)So it is really not clear to which category tewe'tu ‘slope’ belongs. The classifier
suggests that it is morphologically a noun, but it can be used as a verb or ad-
verb without further morphological adaptation. The same holds for the follow-
ing root. ͅrjͅ'tõi means ‘wink’ as a verb stem, ‘from aside’ as an adverb, and if
it exists as a noun, which is suggested by the classifier -tõi ‘eye’ and by the
corresponding neutral nouns ͅrjͅ ‘rib’ and ͅrjͅhͿ ‘side’, it probably means
something like ‘eye from the side’ or ‘screwed-up eye’ (but this was not
tested):(755) ͅrjͅ-'tõi-Ϳ-ki
      side-CL:eye-ATT-DEC
      ‘he narrows his eyes (because of an illness etc.)’    As regards semantics, the morpheme -Ϳ- should basically be viewed as an
attributivising morpheme. The adjective-like or verbal root derived by -Ϳ- usu-
ally refers to an acquired or attributed property of its subject:(756) atsi'le-Ϳ-hͿ                           atsi'le-ki

194   4. The noun phraseWhen the root is a noun, -Ϳ- indicates that an argument of the matrix sentence
is ‘provided with’ (741) or ‘in a permanent state of being’ (742) what the se-
mantic content of the nominal root refers to. In case an adverbial root is derived
by -Ϳ-, the resulting word refers to the location or the quantity of some argu-

the attributive morpheme -Ϳ- is obligatorily attached before any stem formative
morpheme can be applied. Most of these roots are semantically attributive, and
as such they also belong in fact to the present subsection. Nevertheless, they do
not require a subsequent classifier. Therefore I will not discuss them here
again.
    There is another limited set of roots, which is not used without the nomi-
naliser / neutral classifier -hͿ. The difference with the roots ending in -Ϳ- is that
those roots are not yet stems and require further morphological operations,
whereas the roots ending in -hͿ are well-formed stems and may occur as inde-
pendent words. If not further derived than (necessarily) by -hͿ, they are head
nouns or occur as modifiers in juxtaposition to other nouns. When they are
used predicatively, further derivation by verbal marking is required. The mor-
pheme -hͿ cannot be considered as lexicalised with the root, as it can be ex-
changed for a specific classifier (see 4.2.). I have called these roots “bound
roots”.
    The group of bound roots discussed here is also semantically attributive. Its
members are mostly used as stative verbs, but it is in principle not possible to
say that they are verb roots as they require a classifier before anything else.119
For various reasons (lack of time, no opportunity in the field) it was impossible
to document and investigate the behaviour of every lexical root and determine
exactly which other roots potentially belong to the group identified here. How-
ever, most of the roots listed below have been established to share the proper-
ties described here.(764) ay-                ‘that’
      aky-               ‘two’
      arwa-              ‘new’
      acwa-              ‘whole’

      huxe-              ‘hairy’
      Ϳ-                 ‘this’119.There is also another group of bound roots which requires -hͿ or a specific classifier.
    It consists mainly of semantically non-attributive transitive action / process verb
    roots, and in spite of the obligatory classifier, its members do not occur as nouns, and
    will therefore not be treated here (they are mentioned in 5.6.1. and 4.2.1.4.).

close to the speaker and ay- refers to things which are close to the hearer. These
roots cannot function as stems without -hͿ or a specific classifier. They can be
juxtaposed to an (omissible) head noun, as in (714) and in:(775) Ϳ-'hͿ      ko'sa 'si-dy-hͿ-ki

      ‘in that same place where (we know) I slept (before)’One numeral will be illustrated here. Numerals as a separate category will be
discussed more thoroughly in section (4.5.). The numeral root aky- ‘two’ is the
only regular numeral root, and it behaves in the same way as the demonstra-

      ‘two boats’              vs.       ‘two leaves’Some remarks on the irregular items on the list of attributive roots are in order:
    Of those entries in list (764) which are explicitly marked with -hͿ it has not
been established whether the element can be replaced by a specific classifier.
All others occur either with -hͿ or with another classifier.
    As regards the root acwa-, it is not clear whether -hͿ is fully lexicalised with
this root.(778) i'sosisi acwa-'hͿ       wane-'ra
      rope      whole-NOM bring-IMP
      ‘bring the entire rope!’In acwa'rjͿ ‘the entire city’ and acwaricwa ‘city’ it seems to be replaced by
another classifier. There is a possibility, however, that the word has to be ana-
lysed further as having a verbal root a- ‘exist, live’.
   In order to form a noun, ko- ‘be empty, without’ usually requires not only
the application of a classifier but also a further derivation with -te ‘NOM’ (see
5.6.6.):(779) 'prego ko-hͿ-'tİ         a'xy e'hͿ-da-ki
      spike    lack-NOM-NOM house make-1S-DEC
      ‘I make a house without nails’When used as a verb, ko-hͿ- is not required to be succeeded by -te. It is some-
what similar to txi- ‘very big’. In fact, there is even less justification for txi- to
occur in the present list, because it always requires the further derivation with
-te ‘NOM’:(780) ƭ'tswİ̘  txi-hͿ-'tİ                    xui txi-yi-'tİ

198    4. The noun phrase   No attributive use of the numeral teihͿ ‘one’ was attested, nor any replace-
ment of -hͿ with other classifiers.
   It is not clear whether tsanͿsi'hͿ ‘last’ could be further analysed as ‘the fol-
lowing one’. Morphologically this would be difficult, since the verb tsa'si-
‘follow’ is an unanalysable root and reflexive -nͿ- is in the present work not
supposed to behave as an infix.120 Semantically, however, it is tempting to as-
sume a relationship.(781) tsi'ki            tsanͿsi-'hͿ
      younger.brother last-NOM
      ‘younger brother’Some semantically attributive (verbal) roots could also have been included in
the above list, such as wai- ‘good’, nͿ- ‘fat’, kukui- ‘pain’. However, they may
occur either with or without the element -hͿ-, be it with a slightly different
meaning (as noted in 4.2.1.9.):(782) 'wai-ki               wai-'hͿ-ki               wai-'xy-ki
      good-DEC              good-NOM-DEC             good-CL:house-DEC
      ‘it is good’          ‘it is beautiful’        ‘it is a beautiful house’(783) 'rai?ͿhͿ wai-'hͿ-hͿ
      thing    good-NOM-NOM
      ‘very beautiful things’Since the meaning differences between forms with and without -hͿ are quite
small, respectively waihͿ- ‘nice’, nͿhͿ- ‘big’, kukuihͿ- ‘ill’, and since these dif-
ferences are not always consequently distinguished or distinguishable, I have
so far regarded the application of -hͿ as not immediately obligatory. Therefore,
such roots were not discussed in the present subsection.
    Apart from the roots mentioned in (764), there is a number of other adjec-
tive-like roots which do require the element -hͿ-, or another classifier, but of
which no nominal use was attested:(784) babarİ̘'hͿ-        ‘warm’
      bony-              ‘again’ (only as an adverb)121
      hatsi'hͿ-          ‘naked, smooth’
      kyikyi'hͿ-         ‘angry’
      koxona'hͿ-         ‘itchy’
      mǊrjetuce'hͿ-      ‘vertiginous’
      xay'hͿ-            ‘happy’120.Here -nͿ- is used as a directional morpheme, for which see (5.3.1.).
121.The root bony- does not occur with other classifiers than -'hͿ, but it can occur with
    the temporal adverbial nominaliser -wy ‘time’ (see 6.2.4.1.).
                                                    4.3. Attributive modification   199       tei'hͿ(-)        ‘one’
       tjaru'hͿ-        ‘ready’
       tsu'hͿ-          ‘jealous’
       tsunͿ'hͿ-        ‘expensive’From a morpho-semantic point of view these, and other semantically attributive
roots which do not require the element -hͿ- at all, are interesting but they will
not be discussed any further here.
    In principle, possessive constructions could have been dealt with here as
well. The difference with the present group of roots is that possessive attribu-
tives have an independent nominal stem as root. The similarity with the roots
presented in this subsection is that once the possessive morpheme -dy- is ap-
plied, an ensuing classifier is obligatory. The resulting stem can be juxtaposed
to an optional head noun, as shown in (4.3.1.).","[229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237]"

5.1.1.2. Object cross-referenceeteja ‘1PO’. The first person “plural” object form -eteja- occurs in combination
with all subject markers, including indefinite subject. Although this form is not
further analysable, the element -ete- also occurs in the second person “plural”
object form -etelexwa-, and in both forms it may also be pronounced as [İte]
and [Ite]. The element -ja- resembles the indefinite object form -ja- but it is
probably lexicalised (see 5.1.4.).(1052)    'mã-eteja-ki

ond syllable. If it is first succeeded by subject person marking, then secondary
stress falls on its last syllable.
    The element [!İte] resembles the comitative morpheme -ete- (see 5.4.8.),
but there is no reason to suppose that they are productively related. When the
comitative morpheme is followed by the indefinite object marker -ja- the com-
posite meaning does not correspond to ‘first person plural object’:(1056)    babai'ce-ete-ja-da-ki
          dance-COMIT-IO-1S-DEC
          ‘I’m dancing with people/them’Note also that this example contains first person subject -da-, which would not
have been possible if -ete-ja- was a first person plural object here.etelexwa ‘2PO’. The second person “plural” object form -etelexwa- also occurs
with all subjects, including indefinite subject.(1057)    wa'dy-nã-etelexwa-ki

          Arino    hide-2PO-DEC
          ‘Arino hides you (PL)’Although this form is not further analysable, the element -ete- also occurs in
the first person “plural” object form -eteja- and in both forms it can be also
pronounced as [İte] and [Ite]. It bears a strong resemblance to the comitative
morpheme -ete-. At one point the consultant said that addition of the verb duhͿ-
‘all’ as in example (1058) is superfluous here, because this sense is included in
-etelexwa-. A more literal translation of -etelexwa- may then be something like
‘you together’. The consultant apparently made a comparable association and
translated etelexwa in isolation as ‘with you (PL)’.155 In spite of these consid-
erations, if the element -ete- can be related to the comitative morpheme, it is
lexicalised. The following example illustrates how the intransitive verb “dance”
requires a comitative morpheme in order to acquire a comitative sense:155.He confirmed that it cannot be used as a separate word. It is unclear, however, what
    the consultant regards as a “separate word”. He or she may use a pragmatic criterion
    and correctly argue that one cannot utter a word like “you” or “house” in isolation.

          ‘I want to dance with her’              ‘She wants to dance with me’The morpheme -etelexwa-, however, appears not to be able to convey this

          ‘I want to dance with you (pl)’    The element -le- resembles the reciprocal form -lİ- (see 5.4.7.), but it is not
certain that there is a relation.
    The element -xwa- is formally identical to a similar element occurring in
several indefinite subject morphemes, which again resembles the basic indefi-
nite subject marker -wa-. There is an analogous situation involving -ja- in
-eteja-. However, -xwa- also resembles the masculine classifier -xwa- and it
can be optionally replaced by its feminine counterpart -tay-. Nevertheless, the
form with -xwa- (-etelexwa-) can refer to female objects as well:(1062)    haje-'hͿ-etele'xwa-da-ki     (1063)     haje-'hͿ-etele'tay-da-ki

   On two occasions, the element -etele- was attested without subsequent
-xwa- or -tay-:(1064)    mani'ni wa'dy-etele-'nã-a-xa-hͿ-ki

          ‘I’m giving fish to my mate’, ‘we’re giving fish’The correspondence between the form of (1065) and its meaning as represented
by the free translations is not understood well. It could be that they were dis-
torted by the elicitation setting and that the consultant just meant ‘we’re giving
fish to you (PL)’. It is unclear how productive the bare element -etele- is. The
equivalent of (1065) with a first person singular subject was rejected by the
consultant.
    The question of inclusive and exclusive subjects in combination with the
second person plural object is illustrated in (5.1.2.) below.

-hata- is a unique portmanteau morpheme which is not systematically related to
the other person cross-reference forms. It is not likely that the element -ta- is
related to the first person object morpheme.(1066)   zjwãu 'mİ̘-hata-ki    xyitsİ-'wã

   There is no distinction between singular and plural subject. There is only
one instance where the distinction seemed to be made optionally:(1071)   ƭ        / na-'ay-nahere wa'dy-hata(-xwa)-ki

of the indefinite subject marker -wa-. However, in that case one would rather
expect -xuxwa- than -hata-xwa-.
254   5. The verb phrasenƭ’nã ‘2O’. The second person object morpheme -nƭnã- occurs with non-third

Maybe the overt plural pronoun in example (1075) is emphatic enough to allow
for singular agreement on the verb.ta ‘1O’. The first person object form -ta- is used for both second and third per-

         ‘(the flea stung and) drank my (blood)’   The morpheme is homophonous with the transitivising morpheme -ta-,
which belongs to the (derived) verbal root (see 5.4.2.1.). As stress falls usually
on the final syllable of the root, person marking can be distinguished through
the absence of stress:(1082)   a-'ta-ki                          (1083)   a-'ta-ta-ki

         good-CAU-TRA-1O-DEC
         ‘he is good to me’The zero-marked subject of -ta- is usually not a second person plural. With a
second person plural subject an extra -xa- is added, which results in -ta-xa-:(1087)   xyi'tsİ wa'dy-ta-xa-hͿ-'tsy
         you.PL give-1O-2-NOM-RES
         ‘(it was you who) gave me (a present)’The combination *-taxaxa- for a second person plural subject was not consid-
ered well-formed: *xyitsİ wa'dytaxaxaki. Note that the difference between sin-
gular and plural subjects in combination with -ta- can also be expressed by an
overt pronoun alone:(1088)   xyi wa'dy-ta-hͿ-'tsy
         you give-1O-NOM-RES

         ‘(it was you who) gave me (a present)’The combination -ta-xa- was not attested with a second person singular subject
meaning (see also table 23 below).
   In addition to the subject markers, -ta- is the only object marker which has
an allomorph in the remote past construction (5.5.4.): -tay-.

the intransitive subject forms. In reality, they have zero expression because
they are third person arguments. Note also that the impersonal subject form and
the future object form are not represented here. Furthermore, note that the slots
containing a hyphen concern reflexive relations, which are expressed in a dif-
ferent way, and which will not be treated here, but in section (5.4.6.). Note
again that the forms in this table combine with declarative mood marking, and
are not always identical with those which combine with other moods. Note fi-
nally that the forms in between brackets were not recorded so far and may be
impossible.","[288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294]"

          ‘it’s been a long time since the hawk grabbed (chickens)’   Apparently, the remote past morpheme is applied before argument cross-
reference, whereas the nominaliser -hͿ- may occur in alternative positions:(1950)    etohoi-ƭ?ƭ-'hͿ-a-xa-ki

pheme on the predicate:(1954)    *kui-ƭ?ƭ-(da)-ki
          drink-REM-1S-DEC

          you-POS-NOM child-REM-NOM follow-NOM-RES

cient:(1956)    segunDafera-'wy                  (1957)    segunDafera-ƭ?ƭ-'wy

          hunt-REM-COL
          ‘those hunters of the past (of olden times)’   Although the consultant claimed that ƭ?ƭ-hͿ-ki did not occur as an independ-
ent word, it may have occurred as such on several occasions in texts. It was
possible to ask about it in isolation, and he explained that it meant ‘it took a
long time’, ‘it was’, or ‘in the past’.
   The element -ƭ?ƭ-hͿ does not always have a temporal meaning. In the fol-
lowing little dialogue it marks an indignated reply:(1961)    R:     hã'?ã kurakura-'ni           A:     haki'dwa-ƭ?ƭ-hͿ

5.5.4. Remote past by cross-reference reduplication and -hӻSection (7.3.) deals with reduplication as a phonotactically determined process
with grammatical or lexical functions. However, there is also a type of redupli-
cation in Kwaza that could be thought of rather as a morphologically deter237.Or in POR: é pedra, uai!
                                                5.5. Tense, modality and aspect   393mined process with grammatical functions. Whereas reduplication as discussed
in section (7.3.) can involve repetition of either entire lexical content bearing
roots, or of root syllables that have no distinguishable meaning or function of
themselves, in the present section the reduplication of bound person markers in
the verbal complex, which have a grammatical meaning, is discussed. This sort
of reduplication was also the topic of a separate article by van der Voort
(2003). To my knowledge, it has not been attested in any other language.
   A rare instance of this kind of reduplication was already shown in (5.5.2.),
where a past tense construction may involve reduplication of a bound person
marker. The remote past construction discussed here appears to be much more
productive.
   The reduplication of bound argument cross-reference morphemes followed
by -hͿ- creates a sense of remote past. Here, some reduplicated person markers
have a slightly different form. First person singular -da- is expressed by its al-
lomorph -day- in certain positions, second person -xa- by -xay-, first person
plural subject -a- by -ay-, first person singular object -ta- becomes -tay- and in-
definite subject -cwa- (itself an allomorph of -wa-) becomes -cu-, -ci- or -ti-.
Note the following examples:(1962)    xyi mã-xa-'xay-hͿ-ki
          you call-2-2-NOM-DEC
          ‘you have given him (your son) his name’ (t)(1963)    tutunita'hͿ-ti-cwa-hͿ-ki
          think-IS-IS-NOM-DEC
          ‘in olden times they worried a lot’(1964)    txarwa-wy-te'te     'a-ci-cwa-wy were=oja-'tay
          first-time-really   exist-IS-IS-time revolt=go-CL:woman          ‘ta-ci-cwa-nahere 'a-ƭ?ƭ-wy
          talk-IS-IS-COL      exist-REM-time
          ‘it was at the time of those people of the very first time, which they
          called “the rebellious runaway women”‘ (t)For -cu- as an allomorph of -cwa-, see example (1987). Apparently, the exclu-
sive realisation of the first person plural does not have a special allomorph for
reduplication:(1965)    aure-lİ-'nã-a-xa-a-xa-le-hͿ-ki
          marry-RECI-FUT-1P-AS-1P-AS-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘we were going to marry (but we didn’t)’A possible explanation for this is that the first person plural exclusive consists
of two separate morphemes. Another explanation could lie in the fact that the
394   5. The verb phraseassociated person marker is a different type of morpheme. No instances of sec-
ond person plural reduplication have been documented.
    Compare the following examples, and note that there is obviously no redu-
plication when a zero-marked third person subject is involved:(1966)   na-ay-'wy         o'nİ-da-day-hͿ-ki
         PROX-that-time arrive-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
         ‘I arrived at that time’(1967)   na-ay-'wy        o'nİ-hͿ-ki
         PROX-that-time arrive-NOM-DEC
         ‘he arrived at that time’Note that the proximate prefix na- in these examples indicates proximity in the
discourse, and not temporal proximity.
   In view of the different status of object markers, it is remarkable that one of
them, the first person object marker -ta- can be reduplicated, namely by the al-
lomorph -tay-, as if it were somehow part of the subject marking paradigm:(1968)   tsǊhǊ-'du 'si-dy-hͿ       e'tay a'sa-ta-tay-'hͿ-re
         what-BER I-POS-NOM woman leave-1O-1O-NOM-INT
         ‘what a pity my wife left me!’   Remote past seems to be the main function of argument cross-reference re-
duplication followed by -hͿ-. Compare (1969) to example (1940) above, and
compare example (1970) to (1971):(1969)   nǊ'ri-xa-'xay-hͿ-re
         satiate-2-2-NOM-INT

         ‘it has been a long time I was there. I haven’t been there since’   Apparently, the remote past needs to be expressed only once in a sentence,
on the matrix predicate:(1972)   'xa-ta   'Ǌi-xa-ta    İ-'e-xa-xay-hͿ-ki
         2-CSO lie-2-CSO go-again-2-2-NOM-DEC

         a) ‘because I liked her, I married her’
         b) ‘I made love to her and I married her’    The remote past construction may have a perfect connotation, and the frus-
trative morpheme may emphasise the notion that the situation described by the
verb does not obtain anymore in the present:(1974)   aure-lİ-'nã-da-day-hͿ-ki
         marry-RECI-FUT-1S-1S-NOM-DEC

         Barroso-LOC exist-1S-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC
         ‘I lived in Barroso’ (but now not any more)   The remote past is often combined with temporal adverbs:(1977)   jale'ja      aniwesario-'dy-da-day-hͿ-ki

         that-time still      exist-NEG-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
         ‘at that time I was not living here’    In combination with the adverbial perfect particle ja ‘already’, the interpre-
tation of the remote past construction is what Dahl (1985:132) calls the “perfect
of persistent situation”:(1979)   ja        'a-da-day-hͿ-ki        Ba'roso-'na
         already exist-1S-1S-NOM-DEC Barroso-LOC

         already marry-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
         ‘I’m already married’Summarising, one could state that the combination of reduplicated person
marking and nominalisation creates a sense of remote past. Since this construc

is no reason to regard the reduplication it contains as iconic.","[428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434]"

4.1.1. Animate object -wãThe animate object case ending -wã marks certain animate non-subjects of
transitive verbs. It is applied under circumstances that are not fully clear. Often
it attracts stress.
    With most verbs, the animate object marker is obligatory for animate nouns
in direct object function:

     ‘go and see your father!’ (t)Besides indicating which animate argument is object, the case marker -wã also
has the effect of disambiguating between subject and object itself, especially

subject cross-reference marker is zero, but for first and second persons it is not
(see 5.1.). Nevertheless, the case marker -wã is obligatory in the following ex-
amples, even though the cross-reference agreement markers alone would have
been sufficient for the identification of subjects and objects:(77) zjwãu-'wã tsa'si-da-ki                   (78) wã si-'wã e'xyi-ta-ki

subject cross-reference. However, disambiguation is not the principal function
of -wã. Comparison with the previous examples, where there is both cross-
reference and case marking, shows that -wã rather marks the object as animate.
Since the principal function of -wã is animate object case marking, its applica-
tion is ungrammatical with inanimate objects, which apparently includes plants,

pragmatic ambiguity when there is a difference in animacy. Note the following
examples where the subject is animate and the object inanimate and both are
third persons:
                                                                  4.1. Case   109(99) uru'hu xare'ja-ki au           ho-'tİ

receive a case marker. In this situation, one could say that only cross-reference
marking disambiguates the sentence. Note the following examples:(101) kata'ja-da-ki ã'rǊi              (102) ã'rǊi 'hou-da-ki

      ‘you are created by/as fish’ (t)   There may even be gradual differences in animacy. The animate object of
some verbs like ca'ri- ‘shoot, kill game’ is not case-marked, unless the object is
a person:(106) ze'zƭju dutu're ca'ri-ki
      Zezinho pig        shoot-DEC

vegetable beings and lifeless things do not. Apparently there is uncertainty
whether the moon belongs to the animate category:

5.4.2.1. Transitiviser -ta-The morpheme -ta- is often used to transitivise unambiguously intransitive
verbs. It introduces a dative-like object which can sometimes even be regarded
as comitative:(1712)   hyja-'ta-ki
         fall-TRA-DEC
         ‘it fell in front of him’(1713)   magariDa-'wã 'bu=Ǌ-rjͿ-ta-ki
         Margarida-AO put=be-CD:area-TRA-DEC
         ‘it is sitting next to Margarida’Introduced animate objects which are overtly expressed are usually marked
with -wã (see 4.1.1.). In the following example the object is implicit, and both
of the nouns which surround the verb function as locative adverbs (see 6.2.3.):(1714)   tja?a'tje 'a-ta-ki         ma'rjãu-dy-rjͿ
         close      exist-TRA-DEC Marião-POS-CD:area
         ‘he is living close to Marião’The transitiviser usually precedes subject cross-reference morphemes, and
when non-third persons are involved, it also precedes transitive object
cross-reference:(1715)   a-'ta-ta-ki
         exist-TRA-1O-DEC

          fall-TRA-1PO-DEC
          ‘as we were walking, a Brazil nut suddenly fell in front of us’   When applied to the inherently reflexive verb hoñͅ- ‘to hide oneself’, the
transitiviser introduces a dative object.(1718)    e'tay-tjate-'wã    hoñe-'ta-ki
          woman-POS-AO hide-TRA-DEC
          ‘he hid himself from his wife’(1719)    hoñͅ-'ta-a-xa-ki             (1720)     'marju hoñͅ-'ta-ta-ki si-'wã

          ‘we hid from him’                       ‘Mario hid from me’   Furthermore, the transitiviser is sometimes applied to verbs which are al-
ready transitive. The verb waja- ‘to bring, take’ can be considered as inherently
transitive. The application of transitiviser -ta- introduces an extra object with a
recipient function:(1721)    waja-'ta-ki
          bring-TRA-DEC
          ‘he is taking it there to him’The derived verbal stem in (1721) should be considered as ditransitive. Without
the transitiviser -ta- it is transitive. Note that transitive verbs which involve
non-third person arguments always bear transitive object cross-reference. Note
furthermore that first person singular object cross-reference is homophonous
with the transitiviser -ta-. Compare (1721) to the following example:(1722)    wa'ja-ta-ki
          bring-1O-DEC
          ‘he took me’The different stress patterns obviously disambiguate the transitiviser from the
cross-reference morpheme. If the rule is that the main stress position is on the
ultimate syllable of the uninflected stem, the transitiviser is to be considered
part of the stem.221 Verbs marked for transitivisation sometimes show a221.In fact, stress may be one of the criteria for the distinction between inflexional and
    derivational morphology in Kwaza. However, I have tried to ignore this question in
    the present work.
360    5. The verb phrase“wrong” stress pattern, and it is probably variable to some extent. Upon explicit
inquiry, however, “wrong” stress patterns are always rejected: compare
*hy'jataki to (1712).
   In the following examples, the transitiviser -ta- does not seem to introduce
an extra object:(1723)     wai-dy-'ta-nƭnã-da-ki  (1724)               wİ-'ta-taxwa-hͿ
           good-CAU-TRA-2O-1S-DEC                      bring-TRA-IS.1O-NOM
           ‘I like you’                                ‘those who brought me away’The causative morpheme -dy- is normally a transitiviser, but in (1723) it could
be considered as lexicalised. Nevertheless, waidy- ‘to find something good’ in
(1723) can be considered as a transitive verb, just like wİ- ‘to bring someone’
in (1724), since both contain object cross-reference marking, which is restricted
to transitive verbs. The morpheme -ta- seems to underscore the fact that there is
an object.
    So -ta- may both introduce a new object and put focus on the object of a
transitive verb. Maybe -ta- is on its way to lexicalisation with the verb stem.
With a limited number of transitive verbs, -ta- is (semi-) lexicalised or idio-
matic indeed:(1725)     ã'wͿi-        ‘to see’
           ãwãta-'..-    ‘to look at something’(1726)     bİ-           ‘to heat, roast’
           bİ'ta-        ‘to dry clothes in the sun’(1727)     *bii-
           bii'ta-       ‘to stripe something, scratch’(1728)     bu-           ‘to put’
           buu'ta-       ‘to place things in a position parallel to one another’(1729)     o'ja-         ‘to go away, leave’ (lit. ‘arrive thither’)
           oja'ta-       ‘to visit someone’(1730)     o'ri-         ‘to go up, ascend’
           ori'ta-       ‘to go there’222(1731)     wa'txi-       ‘to collect things’
           wa'txita-     ‘to guard something, keep’222.The valency status of this verb is unclear.

the transitivisation of unambiguously intransitive verbs:(1732)    pİ̘rİ̘'jã-da-ki                pİ̘rİ̘jã-'tja-da-ki
          speak-1S-DEC                   speak-TRA-1S-DEC

          quarrel-DEC                    quarrel-TRA-DEC
          ‘he is quarreling’             ‘he quarreled with him’Like -ta- it also introduces a dative-like object, but animate objects which are
overtly expressed are not always marked with -wã. This is discussed in (4.1.1.).
In the following example, animate object marking was considered as optional:(1734)    zjwãu-(wã) enãi-'tja-da-ki
          João-(AO) quarrel-TRA-1S-DEC
          ‘I’m quarreling with João’   The difference between the two transitivisers is not clear. Some verbs re-
quire one, other verbs require the other one. In the following examples, -ta- in-
stead of -tja- would have been ungrammatical:(1735)    talo-'tja-dy-ta    'İ-tsy-hͿ-ki        zjwãu
          sulk-TRA-DS-CSO go-GER-NOM-DEC João
          ‘she got angry223 with him, then João left’(1736)    talo-'tja-da-si     'İ-tsy-hͿ-ki    zjwãu
          sulk-TRA-1S-SWR go-GER-NOM-DEC João
          ‘I got angry with João, so he went’In the next example, however, -tja- would have been ungrammatical:(1737)    kuri-'ta-dy-ta      'İ-tsy-hͿ-ki        zjwãu
          stop-TRA-DS-CSO go-GER-NOM-DEC João
          ‘she did not speak to João, so he went’   The number of verbs which require -tja- for transitivisation seems to be
smaller than the number of verbs which require -ta-. The following examples
contain verbs which are transitivised through application of -tja-:
223.One mainly expresses anger or indignation by not speaking.

         ‘Hermes called me over and told me to speak with Teteru’   Wise (2002:340) suggests that there may be a correlation between
definiteness and the applicative. In Kwaza, when applied to the ambitransitive
verb we- ‘to fear’, the combination of -tja- together with case marking yields a
specific or determinate sense (see also 4.1.1.4.):(1745)   'we-da-ki jere'xwa        (1746)    we-'tja-da-ki        jerexwa-'wã

         ‘I’m afraid of dogs (in general)’   ‘I’m afraid of (this) dog’However, this determinateness is not necessarily productive. Consider the verb
tsasi- ‘to follow behind’:(1747)   zwãu-'wã tsa'si-da-ki
         João-AO     follow-1S-DEC
         ‘I went/came after João’

           steal-1S-SWR see-CSO follow-TRA-1O-CSO beat-1O-DEC
           ‘he saw me steal and went after me and beat me’It is likely that -tja- resembles -ta- in that it may both introduce an object and
put focus on the object or on the transitivity of the verb.
    The transitiviser -tja- appears to be lexicalised with some verbs (both in the
forms -ca- and -tja-):(1749)     du-        ‘to close, finish all’
           du'tja-    ‘to fill’(1750)     Ǌ-         ‘to be, stand, sit’
           Ǌ'ca-      ‘to lie in ambush (for an animal)’(1751)     *mͿi-
           mͿi'ca- ‘to frighten (someone)’224   Since the verb root tjata- ‘to say to a person’ has a transitive sense, it is
imaginable that it derives from the verb ta- ‘to say, talk’, transitivised by the
element -tja- as a prefix:(1752)     tja'ta-ta-tsy-tse
           say-1O-POT-DEC
           ‘he is going to talk with me’However, the root tjata- ‘say’ and the relatively fixed expressions tjara ‘do it!’
and ratja- ‘to order (someone)’ originate probably from the combined proc-
esses of ellipsis and cliticisation. It follows from the discussion in (5.5.11.1.)
and (7.5.2.) that the cosubordinative marker -tja- seems to be a more likely
candidate for identification with the “prefix”.","[396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401]"
"
3.1.5. Unattested categoriesThere is no reason to distinguish adjectives, articles and adpositions as separate
categories in Kwaza.
   With regard to adjectives, “adjectival” concepts are usually expressed in
Kwaza by verb roots followed by the canonical verbal inflexions. Attributive
modification is realised by juxtaposition of nouns, which includes nominalised
“adjectival” verbs. Note the following example where the nominal head is
modified by a nominalised dependent:(22) 'mangka 'ki-hͿ            'ja-da-ki
     mango ripe-NOM            eat-1S-DEC
     ‘I ate a ripe mango’    Definiteness and indefiniteness are not expressed in the form of articles.
There are, however, special bound verbal person morphemes that mark indefi-
nite object and indefinite subject. Furthermore, specificity can be indicated by
demonstratives, pronouns and proper names, which are all expressed as free
nouns, and by bound verbal person markers and bound classifiers.
    With respect to adpositions, their function is fulfilled in Kwaza by “oblique”
case suffixes that may express location, instrument, beneficiary and comitative.
Note the following locative example:(23) i'tso-na         'cutsͅrjͿ-ki
     hammock-LOC lie-DEC
     ‘he lay in the hammock’
                                                          3.1. Parts of speech   953.1.6. Problems with the criteriaAs mentioned above nouns can be zero-verbalised, which makes them indistin-
guishable from verbs at first sight. In the example below, a noun occurs in the
place of a verb root:(24) ka'we-ki
     coffee-DEC
     ‘it is coffee’This is not a real problem for the distinction between nouns and verbs, how-
ever, since the formal and functional criteria listed in (3.1.1.) solve the apparent
incongruity.
   A real formal threat to the category distinction, however, is the phenomenon
of morphological ellipsis. This can occur under specific pragmatic circum-
stances. One type of morphological ellipsis concerns the ellipsis of verbal in-
flexions. In this case, verb roots occur as independent morphemes, while the
absent inflexions of person and mood are understood in the pragmatic context
by speaker and hearer. Note the following example, in which the root lacks the
expected second person subject and interrogative mood inflexions:(25) ka'we     kui
     coffee drink
     ‘did you have coffee?’Another type of ellipsis is ellipsis of verbal roots, in which case the complex of
person and mood inflexions occurs as an independent word. Note the following
example:(26) Q: 'ja-xa-'re               A: da-'ki
        eat-2-INT                   1S-DEC
        ‘are you eating?’           ‘(yes) I am’Of course, morphological ellipsis is completely dependent on the speech con-
text from which the ellipsed elements have to be “understood”. Nevertheless,
this phenomenon is not just an exception to criteria (in this case a and b) that
define verbs and distinguish them from nouns; it also represents a problem for
the analysis of Kwaza as a morphologically complex language in general.
There are, however, reasons to stick with this analysis. All this is discussed in
section (7.5.) on morphological ellipsis.
96     3. Parts of speech and constituent order3.2.   Types of morphemesIn this section, a schematic overview is given of different types of parts of
words, i.e. morphemes, and how they relate to specific parts of speech. There
are two basic morpheme types: free morphemes and bound morphemes. The
free morphemes can be further divided in monomorphemic stems, which may
represent either nouns, adverbs or particles, and morphologically complex
stems, which can represent any independent word, including inflected verbs.","[132, 133, 134]"
"
3.1.   Parts of speechTrying to decide upon the question of what should be regarded as a “word” in
Kwaza, I have in the present work used a combination of phonological and
grammatical criteria. If an element may contain a stressed syllable and can oc-
cur in different positions in an utterance, I regard it as a word.
    In general, main word stress tends to fall on the last syllable of the root. A
number of roots appear to coincide with monomorphemic stems which can oc-
cur as syntactically free elements in the clause. Another group of roots require
attachment of other elements before they can be syntactically free.
    As it happens, this division between different kinds of roots can provide the
basis for a distinction between parts of speech in Kwaza. The coincidence of
certain formal and functional properties of free elements in Kwaza justifies a
major distinction of the grammatical categories of nouns, adverbs and particles
as opposed to verbs.

5.1.4.1. Indefinite subjectwa ‘IS’. The indefinite subject morpheme -wa- is often encountered as the sole
person inflexion on a verb. It indicates that the third person subject is not speci-
fied, only the semantic content of the predicate being of interest.(1103)    'kui-wa-'ki
          drink-IS-DEC
          ‘people are / someone is drinking’This utterance was made in a context in which the speaker went over to the
nearby house and heard or saw that there was a party going on, and upon re-
turning she informed the hearer about it (for reasons such as the hearer having
asked the speaker to see for him, or the speaker wanting to get the hearer to ac-
company her and join the party). In such a context, kuiki ‘they are / he is
drinking’ would have been less appropriate. So kuiwaki can be translated more
or less as ‘there is drinking going on’. Similar examples can be given:(1104)    dodotxi'te o'hui-ki              (1105)    dodotxi'te o'hui-wa-ki
          ball         play-DEC                      ball        play-IS-DEC
          ‘he/they are playing ball’                 ‘they (many) are playing ball’(1106)    a'wͿi-da-ki     a'rǊi-wã     mawdy'ne-wa-ta

          ‘I saw them call tapir to come to them’ (t)
156.But note that the interrogative pronoun di'lİ can be used with an indefinite sense in
    non-interrogative constructions (4.7.4.).

          already eat-IS-DEC                        already leave-IS-DEC
          ‘they are already eating                  ‘someone is already going
           / they have already eaten’                / went there’(1109)    a-'he-ty-wa-ki
          exist-NEG-DET-IS-DEC
          ‘I bet they don’t encounter anyone’, ‘there is no-one for him!’(1110)    tja?a'tje 'a-wa-hͿ                        'ãi    'a-wa-hͿ
          close     exist-IS-NOM                    far exist-IS-NOM
          ‘those who live nearby’        vs.        ‘those who live further away’   It requires a more thorough and time-consuming analysis of all the full
contexts in order to be able to explain the exact meaning and possible idiomatic
uses of the indefinite subject marker in every attested occurrence, than can be
done in the present work. As an example it was sometimes said that the addi-
tion of -wa- could be regarded as “respectful”. Nevertheless, there is an impor-
tant morphosyntactic clue which corroborates the “indefinite”-hypothesis of
-wa-: the indefinite morpheme does not cross-reference an overt argument. In
general, a definite argument is then unmentionable:(1111)    lu'zeu   mƭu      peri'Dauwa-wã wa'dy-ki
          Luzeu chicha Peridalva-AO give-DEC
          ‘Luzeu gave chicha to Peridalva’(1112)    *luzeu mƭu       peri'Dauwa-wã wa'dy-wa-ki
          Luzeu chicha Peridalva-AO give-IS-DEC
          ‘someone Luzeu gave chicha to Peridalva’157(1113)    pju xy'xy-(hͿ)-ki              (*pju xyxy-wa-(hͿ)-ki)
          Piu scream-NOM-DEC
          ‘Piu screamed’The following example contained -wa- even though both speaker and hearer
knew the identity of the subject (in this case Daniel Latundê):(1114)    ywy'nwͿ 'dy=asa-wa-ki
          tree    cut=leave-IS-DEC
          ‘someone/they cut the log and cleared it out of the way’Nevertheless, it is impossible to inquire about the identity of the subject while
using an indefinite cross-reference marker:157.Even if no-one knows who Luzeu is, this sentence is ungrammatical.
                                                 5.1. Person cross-reference   261(1115)   di'lİ xy'xy-(*wa)-re
         who scream-IS-INT
         ‘who screamed?’This was also illustrated in (4.7.4.). However, some overt arguments can be re-
garded as indefinite:(1116)   txi'rja wy'ru-wa-re          (1117)     txi'rja-wa-ta
         everyone grind-IS-INT                   everyone-IS-CSO
         ‘everyone helps grinding?’ (t)          ‘being everyone / everyone is’There is no indefinite pronoun ‘someone’ or ‘nobody’. Instead, a nominalised
verbalisation of a noun may be used:(1118)   mãrİ̘ri'tsa-wa-hͿ kwİ'nİ-wa-ki
         human-IS-NOM      enter-IS-DEC
         ‘someone/a person entered (here, while we were away)’(1119)   Ǌcenãi-'he-wa-hͿ       ere're-wa-ki
         know-NEG-IS-NOM        write-IS-DEC
         ‘they are writing up that which nobody knows’Apparently, some nouns like wã ‘wasp’ can act as an indefinite subject. The
reason for this possibility is probably that when a swarm of wasps attacks, they
are not definite individuals any more, as far as the victim is concerned. So one
could say that the application of -wa- has a de-individualising effect. This may
also create a passive-like effect, though not more than that:(1120)   wã e'xyi-ki              (1121)      wã e'xyi-wa-ki
         wasp sting-DEC                       wasp sting-IS-DEC
         ‘the wasp stung him’,                ‘wasps stung him’,
         ‘it’s a wasp who stung him’          ‘he received stings from wasps’(1122)   wã-'wã e'xyi-wa-ki
         wasp-AO sting-IS-DEC
         ‘they stung the wasp’An alternative translation of (1121) had an indefinite object: ‘wasp stung
someone’. This may suggest a passive nature of -wa- (‘people were stung’) af-
ter all. However, the verb exyi- ‘sting (by wasp)’ is exceptional itself: the form
e'xyi-da-ki, with first person subject inflexion, both means ‘I stung (him)’ as ‘I
got stung’. It is probably because of the unusualness of the first, literal mean-
ing, that the second interpretation is enabled. Nevertheless, it is considered
more correct to use a first person object form in this case: e'xyi-ta-ki ‘I got
stung’ (lit. ‘stung me’). Also the result of nominalisation of certain verb stems
262   5. The verb phrasemay be ambiguous in this respect: it may refer to an object or to the subject, re-
gardless whether -wa- is present:(1123)   dutu're hãtsǊ-'hͿ           (1124)      dutu're hã'tsǊ-wa-'hͿ

         ‘he (who) was skinning the pig’         ‘they (who) skinned the pig’(1125)   a'wͿi-da-ki ay'hͿ tswa dutu're hã'tsǊ-'hͿ

         that see-1S-DEC pig          skin-IS-NOM
         ‘I saw that pig which they skinned’These constructions were also discussed in (8.4.1.4.).
   Although I have found no evidence for a passive in Kwaza, it should be
mentioned that elicited translations of Portuguese passive sentences into Kwaza
often contain the element -wa-:(1127)   ecoto'hͿ-wa-ki     ca'ri-wa-ki       (1128)    tã'jã 'ta-wa-hͿ
         retaliate-IS-DEC   shoot-IS-DEC                chief say-IS-NOM
         ‘he was punished’,                             ‘the one called chief’,
         ‘they killed him’                              ‘the one they call chief’When a truly definite subject is expressed in combination with indefinite sub-
ject reference -wa-, this subject is part of a group functioning as an indefinite
subject:(1129)   lato-'wy          pju ohui'nƭ-wa-ta
         yesterday-time Piu play-IS-CSO
         ‘yesterday, Piu and the others were playing’
         (lit. ‘yesterday Piu they were playing’)This may create the impression that the element -wa- is a plural marker:(1130)   i'grezja-'na e'tay  'tswa-cwa-ta 'nãi-wa-ki
         church-LOC woman man-IS-CSO          like-IS-DEC

phology of Kwaza, whereas most occurrences of -wa- suggest that it expresses
indefiniteness of the subject. The contrast between following examples shows
that a plural subject reading is out of the question:(1132)   aky-'hͿ    e'mã-cwa-ta    'dai-cwa-ki ('manga)
         two-NOM more-IS-CSO take-IS-DEC mango
         ‘someone took three (mangoes)’(1133)   aky-'hͿ     e'mã-cwa-ta     da-'dai-wa-ki        ('manga)
         two-NOM more-IS-CSO RED-take-IS-DEC              mango
         ‘a number of people took three (mangoes)’The contrast between (1132) and the next example rather confirms that indefi-
niteness is involved:(1134)   aky-'hͿ      e'mã-tja   'dai-kizjwõ 'manga
         two-NOM more-CSO take-DEC João mango
         ‘João took three mangoes’    Only few examples were encountered which appear to go against the indefi-
nite analysis of -wa-:(1135)   zjwãu     'kwİ-wa-ki
         João      enter-IS-DEC
         ‘João entered here’It is not so likely that this example has a similar pragmatic context as (1129).
    The following example is from a story about a tapir which transforms itself
into a human being. When the transformed man was shot dead, he turned back
into a tapir:(1136)   ã'rǊi a're-wa-hͿ
         tapir turn-IS-NOM
         ‘the transformed tapir’ (t)Here there is no doubt about the definiteness and singularity of the tapir, but
maybe there is an explanation in the fact that the transformation happened
automatically, and that the tapir is not a subject here any more.
   In combination with the imperative mood, -wa- may have a kind of vocative
function:(1137)   tso'roi-wa-ra
         run-IS-IMP
         ‘run, everybody!’
264    5. The verb phraseThe fact that -wa- does not only have its normal indefinite function here is con-
firmed by the fact that it can be succeeded by another subject marking element
-xa-:158(1138)    towa-'nã-tse      tso'roi-wa-xa-ra=tja 'ta-ja-hͿ=wara
          fall-FUT-DEC run-IS-AS-IMP=CSO talk-IO-NOM=but
          ‘“it’s going to fall, people, run!”, he warned them, but ...’ (t)    On some occasions -wa- was explicitly indicated by the consultant to have
an evidential function. For the following example MA deliberately described a
context of the speaker arriving in a room where (either one or many) people are
in the presence of an empty coffee pot and that that is the reason to draw the
conclusion that those people must have drunk all the coffee:(1139)    ka'wİ    kui='bwa-(c)wa-ki
          coffee drink=end-IS-DEC
          ‘(apparently) they finished the coffee’In this case the evidence is indirect, and it is possible that the evidential analy-
sis of -wa- matches with the (unfortunately often poorly registered) contexts of
many (elicited) examples in the present section. However, the fact that the oc-
currence of this morpheme was claimed to rule out the presence of overt argu-
ments in most cases, such as in (1112) and (1113), goes against this analysis
(but note that (1135) is a telling exception in this respect). Furthermore there
seem to be elicited examples of -wa- occurring in eyewitness contexts, e.g. in
(1103) above and in (3510) in (8.3.1.5.). Also, there are many cases of -wa- oc-
curring in eyewitness accounts in the initiation story by ME (part II, text 3.1.).
On the other hand, MA complained about the latter story that ME talked about
her experiences in a way as if she had not participated herself. Furthermore, the
problem remains that the isolated utterances and their contexts were all elicited
in relatively uncontrolled settings, and it cannot be excluded that the consult-
ant’s interpretation of the imagined situation was completely the opposite. As
more textual research is needed here I consider indirect evidentiality for the
time being as a side effect of the basic indefinite function of -wa-.
    The indefinite subject marker -wa- has several allomorphs. The allomorph
-cwa- occurs often as an optional variant of -wa- in cosubordinating construc-
tions discussed in (8.3.1.5.), when following the negative morpheme -he-
(7.1.1.), and probably when following the future morpheme -nã-:(1140)    kui-nã-cwa-ki              (*kui'nãwaki)
          drink-FUT-IS-DEC
          ‘they’re going to drink, there’s going to be drinking’158.In this example, -xa- was glossed as an associated third person marker, but there is
    no way to establish here whether it is not rather a second person subject marker.
                                                      5.1. Person cross-reference    265The allomorph is obligatory in constructions which involve double sets of in-
flexion marking such as quoted speech (5.5.11.), purposive (5.5.12.) and con-
jectural (5.5.14.) constructions. In the remote past (5.5.4.) and habitual (5.5.26.)
constructions, the allomorph -cwa- is usually reduplicated and has the forms
-cu-, -ci- or -ti- ([tu] ~ [tÓ] ~ [ti] ~ [ti]). This is further illustrated by several ex-
amples in the relevant sections, but note also (1130) and (1131) above. The in-
definite different subject morpheme -dwa- is probably related to -wa-. It occurs
only in cosubordinated clauses and indicates that the subject is different from
the indefinite subject of the next clause. This is dealt with in (8.3.2.2.).
   Note that the third person declarative marker -tse is never encountered in
combination with -wa- or its allomorphs.
   Note also that neither -wa- nor its allomorphs seem to cross-refer to inani-
mate subjects.
   The form -wa- has a reflex [swa] in the first and second person object mor-
phemes -taxwa- and -xuxwa-. Some of the properties of indefinite cross-
reference demonstrated above will be illustrated more extensively under
-xuxwa- and -taxwa- below, and under -ja- in (5.1.4.2.).taxwa ‘IS.1O’. In the indefinite subject- first person object morpheme -taxwa-,
the first person object marker -ta- is clearly identifiable. The remaining element
-xwa- strongly resembles the indefinite subject marker -wa-. The relation be-
tween -xwa- and -wa- cannot be explained by morphophonemic rules. Most
likely -xwa- is lexicalised in both -taxwa- ‘(IS.1O)’ and -xuxwa- ‘(IS.2O)’.
    The following examples show this morpheme involved in cross-reference to
indefinite subject combined with a first person object (which consequently is
definite).(1141)    wa'dy-taxwa-ki                          (1142)     ka'hİ-taxwa-ki
          give-IS.1O-DEC                                     bite-IS.1O-DEC
          ‘they/he (someone) gave to me’                     ‘they bit me’About the intended subject(s) in example (1142) the consultant said “you can’t
say their names”. Also, it is not possible to inquire about the identity of the in-
definite subject:(1143)    di'lİ ka'hİ-ta-re            (*dilİ ka'hİtaxware)
          who bite-1O-INT
          ‘who bit me?’This is also illustrated for other persons and for -wa- in (4.7.4.).
   The next examples show the occurrence of -taxwa- in various constructions.
In every one of them, it has the same sense.

         (lit. ‘it’s he who took my money, that’s it!’)xuxwa ‘IS.2O’. In the indefinite subject- second person object morpheme
-xuxwa-, the apparent second person element -xu- does not strongly resemble
the second person subject morpheme -xa-. One consultant (TE) says [tsiswa].
The constituent elements of -xuxwa- cannot function as separate morphemes
for themselves: wadyxuxwaki ‘someone/they gave to you’ vs. *wadyxuki,
*wadyxwaki.
     According to MA -xuxwa- is an alternative to -hata-. Clearly, the indefinite
subject is felt as an (indefinite) third person subject. As with -wa- and -taxwa-,
it is not possible to specify or inquire about the subject:(1149)   ka'hİ-xuxwa-ki      (1150)    di'lİ ka'hİ-hata-re (*ka'hİxuxware)

curs normally as a fixed part of -xuxwa- and -taxwa-. Among the rare instances
of its “independent” use we find it in example (1071). It is not clear whether
indefinite subject -(x)wa- is etymologically related to the (homophonous) clas-
sifier -xwa- ‘man’.eteja-wa ‘1PO-IS’ and etelexwa-wa ‘2PO-IS’ are morpheme combinations in
which the indefinite subject morpheme -wa- is productively applied to the cor-

flexion on a verb, and it indicates that the third person object is not specified,
as only the semantic content of the predicate is of interest.(1163)   mƭu       darje-'dy-ja-ki

         ‘the woman is not angry towards people’The morpheme -ja- is fully productive for all subjects, including indefinite
subject, and has to precede the subject markers. As with all other indefinite
cross-reference morphemes, it is in principle not possible to mention an overt
object corresponding with -ja-.(1167)   lu'ze-wã     wa'dy-xa-ki          (*lu'zewã wady'jaxaki)

reference marker can be immediately adjacent to the special declarative marker
-tse. One would expect the same to be the case for the indefinite object marker
-ja-. Note, however, example (1198) below and the following one:(1177)    wady-'ja-tse
          give-IO-DEC
          ‘he gave to him’   On the verb roots ta- ‘to talk’ and İhİta- ‘to tell’, -ja- may have an evasive
function. It is used evasively when it refers to one’s living close relatives, espe-
cially children, grandchildren or newly born babies:(1178)    'hoBinson 'ta-ja-da-ki
          Robinson talk-IO-1S-DEC
          ‘I call him Robinson’It may even have a lamentative interpretation, and it is often used to refer to

          ‘I warned the poor fellow’
270   5. The verb phrase   It is not clear whether -ja- can also refer to inanimate indefinite objects.
Possibly it cannot:(1181)    ã'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki     ãwͿi-'ja-xa-xay-'hͿ
          see-1S-NOM-DEC see-IO-2-2-NOM

          see-1S-NOM-DEC see-2-2-NOM
          ‘I saw that photo you took (of house, dog, waterfall etc.)’  Usually, no other morphemes intervene between object and subject markers.
Only two positive exceptions were attested:159(1183)    'krİBa-na oitsi-ja-'nã-xa-re
          Gleba-LOC copulate-IO-FUT-2-INT
          ‘are you going to get laid in Gleba?’In section (7.1.), the relative position of the negation morpheme is discussed.
The negative morpheme canonically precedes the cross-reference markers:(1184)    kahİ-'he-ja-ki
          bite-NEG-IO-DEC
          ‘it (e.g. grasshopper) does not bite’In case of negation of a presupposition, however, the negative morpheme fol-
lows cross-reference marking:(1185)    axehͿ-ja-'he-damͿ-cehere (jã-ki)
          find-IO-NEG-want-APPR          be-DEC

          ‘don’t be afraid, it does not bite (anyone)’   Normally, double object marking within a single verb is not accepted:(1187)    *wai-ja-ta-ki
          good-IO-1O-DEC
          ‘it does good to me’159.Also in example (1053) a future morpheme follows the object morpheme.
                                                 5.1. Person cross-reference   271It appears that -ja-, although being an object marker itself, can occur together
with another, definite object marker in one word:(1188)   axehͿ-ja-'he-eteja-ki
         find-IO-NEG-1PO-DEC
         ‘he did not meet us’Note that both object markers are separated by a negative morpheme and that
-ja- precedes it. This can be seen as a case of recursive derivation, and it may
indicate that -ja- is derived on a deeper level than the subsequent elements. A
likely interpretation would be ‘he met no-one of us’ or ‘he did not meet anyone
with respect to us’. This also suggests that -ja- is not a constituing part of
-İteja-. Maybe -ja- is lexicalised with the verb root as axehͿja- ‘meet’.
    The indefinite object morpheme has clearly a plural connotation in the fol-
lowing example:(1189)   e'tay-nahere-wã wa'dy-ja-ra
         woman-COL-AO give-IO-IMP
         ‘give (it) to all women!’   It is not clear whether the second occurrence of -ja- in the third phrase be-
low represents a second instance of indefinite object marking:(1190)   wady-'ja-da-ki          ‘I gave to them’
         wady-'ja-du'hͿ-da-ki    ‘I gave all to them’
         wady-'ja-duhͿ-'ja-da-ki ‘I gave all to them all’    Even though the following example involves a definite subject, -ja- is ap-
plied. It is probably lexicalised with the root asa- ‘to leave’ as a euphemism:(1191)   asa-'ja-da-ki
         leave-IO-1S-DEC
         ‘I buried him’    Some verbs contain a root-final element -ja-, which may originate from the
indefinite object morpheme, but which is completely lexicalised. Semantically
it does not refer to an indefinite object. As an example xareja- ‘search things’
does take overt definite objects: ui xare'jadaki ‘I’m looking for the tobacco’. In
order to refer to an indefinite object the addition of -ja- is required:(1192)   xareja-'ja-da-ki        (1193)       waja-'ja-he-tsy-tse
         search-IO-1S-DEC                     bring-IO-NEG-POT-DEC
         ‘I’m searching (many) people’        ‘he is not going to bring anyone’
272   5. The verb phrase5.1.4.3. Extension to inclusive object referenceSome translations provided by the consultant suggest that, in the proper con-
text, a first person object can be “understood” and be expressed by the indefi-
nite object morpheme -ja-:(1194)   'a-ty-ja-ki               (1195)    o'tsi-ja-ki
         exist-DET-IO-DEC                    fall-IO-DEC
         ‘there was for us’                  ‘it fell on top of us’(1196)   axe'hͿ-ja-ki
         find-IO-DEC
         ‘he met (us)’ (accidentally on the road)In fact, the example (1196) was presented in a first person inclusive context,
whereas contrasted with a first person exclusive context the consultant offered
the following Kwaza equivalent:(1197)   axe'hͿ-e'teja-ki
         find-1PO-DEC
         ‘he met (us)’ (accidentally on the road)These examples represent the only attested pair in which a contrast between in-
clusive and exclusive first person interpretations of object cross-reference
markers can be suspected. Now remember from example (1177) above that,
against expectations, the indefinite object marker -ja- can be followed by the
special declarative marker -tse. So, when inquiring about a truly indefinite ob-
ject equivalent of (1196) the following sentence was offered:(1198)   axehͿ-'ja-tse
         find-IO-DEC
         ‘he met them’As a consequence, two apparent anomalies with respect to the expected be-
haviour of object cross-reference; an inclusive reading (of -ja-) and a combina-
tion (of -ja-) with the morpheme -tse, may be related in that they work together
to enable both the expression of an inclusive object and of a true indefinite ob-
ject. In view of the fact that these are the only clear examples encountered, it
may not be the case that the distinctions discussed here are fully grammati-
calised. Example (1094) above forms evidence for the fact that -eteja- may
cross-refer to an inclusive pronoun. Furthermore, the verb axehͿ- ‘find’ may be
ideosyncratic. Nevertheless, about the following examples it was said that they
have the same meaning, but that the second alternative was “better”:
                                                      5.1. Person cross-reference   273(1199)    'mİ̘-ja-wa-ki                 (1200)     mİ̘-'eteja-wa-ki

          ‘they hit us’                            ‘they hit us’In case the first alternative involves an inclusive first person object, it may have
been considered as less felicitous because it is less easy to imagine a proper
pragmatic context for uttering it.","[297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311]"
"
8.4.3. The overlap between attributive and complement clausesBoth types of nominal clauses, i.e. those nominalised by -hͿ and those nomi-
nalised by -nãi, function as arguments of matrix predicates. It seems that -hͿ
has a wider application range than -nãi. -nãi does not form attributive con-
structions, whereas -hͿ does sometimes form a complement clause. Compare
(3675) to the next example:(3701)    atxitxi'?Ǌ watxa'ta-nã-hͿ       horony'hͿ-nã-ki
          rice         weed-one-NOM       prepare-one-DEC
          ‘we are finishing weeding the rice’404.In POR: de matar, que ele matou.
405.(CX: I’m going to tell about the fact that I drank.) POR: que eu tomei.
702    8. Subordination and coordinationUnder certain circumstances -nãi and -hͿ seem to be freely interchangeable.
Note that the following examples were originally translated identically by the
consultant406 and that the distinction between the English versions is introduced
by myself:(3702)    jere'xwa     'bu=Ǌ-dwa-hͿ       a'wͿi-da-ki
          jaguar       put=be-DR:onto-NOM see-1S-DEC
          ‘I saw the dog sitting’(3703)    jere'xwa      'bu=Ǌ-dwa-nãi          a'wͿi-da-ki
          jaguar        put=be-DR:onto-NOM see-1S-DEC
          ‘I saw (that) the dog (was) sitting’Example (3702) is translated in accordance with the attributive clause analysis.
Besides being an argument, the embedded subject is a head. The head is fur-
thermore the object of the matrix verb. Example (3703) is translated in accor-
dance with the complement clause analysis. The embedded subject is an argu-
ment only, whereas the object of the matrix verb is the nominalised predicate.
The following pair of examples shows a similar contrast between attributive
clauses in -hͿ and complement clauses in -nãi:407(3704)    a'wͿi-da-ki jere'xwa kane'xu bu-'hͿ
          see-1S-DEC jaguar necklace wear-NOM
          ‘I saw the/a dog wearing a necklace’(3705)    a'wͿi-da-ki jere'xwa kane'xu bu-'nãi
          see-1S-DEC jaguar necklace wear-NOM
          ‘I saw that the/a dog wore a necklace’If the present analyses are correct, one could say that -hͿ is a dependent forma-
tive and -nãi is a head formative. This is in accordance with the fact that -hͿ
produces nouns which refer to participants of events, and -nãi produces nouns
which refer to events themselves.
    There may nevertheless be a transitional area between attributive clause-like
nominalisations and complement clause-like nominalisations. The following
example contains a headless attributive clause with an embedded overt subject.
It is not very clear what is the (implicit) head of the attributive clause:(3706)    wã e'xyi-ta-hͿ          da'nͿ     ku'kui-ki
          bee sting-1O-NOM still            hurt-DEC
          a) ‘the bee’s sting of me still hurts’, b) ‘the bee’s stinging me still
          hurts’, c) ‘the place where the bee stung me still hurts’406.The offered POR translation for both was eu vi um cachorro sentando.
407.The POR translation given by the consultant for both was: eu vi cachorro com colar.
                                                         8.4. Nominal clauses   703Example (3706) has three different possible translations.408 The first one seems
the most likely equivalent of the Kwaza sentence, even though the subject wã
‘bee’ is not a possessor. The implicit head can neither be ‘bee’, nor ‘sting’
(Kwaza does not even have a noun with that meaning). Translation (3706a)
suggests that it represents an inherently headless attributive clause that bears
similarity to (3649). The second translation is based on the analysis of the
nominal clause as a complement clause in the sense of section (8.4.2.). The
third translation represents what seems to be the least likely analysis. It sug-
gests that the implicit head of the attributive clause is a locative satellite: ‘the
place’, as it is possibly the case in (3638).
    Of course, translations never constitute decisive evidence in themselves for
the analysis of structures in another language. The consultant commented that
bu'hͿ and bu'nãi meant exactly the same and he even translated one example of
the latter as attributive-like, rather than as complement-like:(3707)    kane'xu bu-'nãi        a'wͿi-da-ki
          necklace wear-NOM see-1S-DEC
          ‘I saw (one) with a necklace’409Meanwhile, he also translated nominal clauses ending in -hͿ sometimes as
complement clauses. What makes translations in this context even more inde-
pendable is the fact that in Portuguese the word que functions both as a relative
pronoun ‘which, who’ and as a complementiser ‘that’.
   It must be emphasised that the consultant translated most examples in a way
which corresponds systematically with the analysis presented here in (8.4.).
Compare the next example to examples (3652) and (3653):(3708)    kahİ-'hͿ      a'wͿi-da-ki etohoi-'wã (jere'xwa)
          bite-NOM see-1S-DEC child-AO            jaguar
          ‘I saw that (the dog) bit the child’410This example differs from (3652) in that the embedded verb does not contain
the gerundial morpheme -tsy-, whereas it is similar to the extent that it does
have an object marked by -wã. The situation is reversed with respect to (3653).
Here, (3708) differs in that it has an object marked by -wã, whereas it is similar
where the morphology of the embedded verb is concerned. The fact that the
nominal clause in (3708) ends in -hͿ suggests that we are dealing with an at-
tributive clause. However, the presence of -wã on the embedded object sug-
gests that this object is not the head. And the absence of -tsy- suggests when
compared to (3653) that the subject is not the head either. The translation given408.The original POR translation is: (o fato que) marimbondo me ferrou(,) 'ta doendo
    aínda (what stands between brackets was added later by me).
409.In POR eu vi (um) com colar.
410.In POR: eu vi que cachorro morde criança.
704    8. Subordination and coordinationby the consultant confirms the suspicion that neither the embedded subject nor
the embedded object is head of the nominal clause, but that we are dealing with
a complement clause.411
    Probably, (3706) represents an example from the twilight zone between at-
tributive and complement clauses. The fact that such ambiguous examples usu-
ally bear the nominaliser -hͿ and rarely -nãi, may be explained on the basis of
the fact that -hͿ is a nominaliser of a more general or abstract calibre than -nãi.
Although -nãi is semantically just as abstract as -hͿ, it is grammatically more
specific. Hence, it could be that -hͿ can fulfil the function of -nãi, as in (3708),
but not the other way round (with the possible exception of (3707)).
    There is another factor which may explain the interchangeability of certain
nominal clauses which end in -hͿ or -nãi. The observations in section (8.4.1.6.)
suggest that non-restrictive clauses in -hͿ are semantically equivalent to com-
plement clauses in -nãi. It does not seem unlikely that attributive clauses which
are translated as complement clauses, or which can be freely used instead of
complement clauses, are non-restrictive attributive clauses. The fact that com-
plement clauses ending in -nãi cannot be restrictive is related to the fact that
-nãi nominalisations never modify other nouns.
    Unfortunately, it was rarely tested whether the -hͿ examples in the present
section (8.4.3.) were intended as non-restrictive. Here are some further exam-
ples of attributive clauses, along with their original translations. (3709) and
(3710) contain complement clauses and (3711) contains an attributive clause:(3709)     wi-nͿ-ko'je-hͿ            a'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki
           cut-REF-CL:hand-NOM see-1S-NOM-DEC
           ‘I saw that he had cut himself’(3710)     wi-nͿ-ko'je-nãi           a'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki
           cut-REF-CL:hand-NOM see-1S-NOM-DEC
           ‘I saw that he had cut himself’(3711)     wi-nͿ-ko'je-tsy-hͿ          a'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki
           cut-REF-CL:hand-GER-NOM see-1S-NOM-DEC
           ‘I saw that man who had cut himself’
8.5.   CoordinationIn Kwaza there is no special particle or bound morpheme which means ‘and’.
Coordination of verbal clauses is realised by the cosubordinating construction
discussed in (8.3.). One example is given here:411.Unless it is a headless object attributive clause where etohoiwã stands in extraposi-
    tion, or unless it is a headless subject attributive clause in which the element -tsy- is
    not essential.
                                                         8.5. Coordination   705(3712)   pãu 'ja-ta      hã    'kui-ki
         bread eat-CSO water drink-DEC
         ‘he ate bread and drank water’ (TMA:86)   Coordination of noun phrases can be realised through several different
grammatical operations which involve juxtaposition and zero-verbalisation.
The primary function of noun juxtaposition is attributive modification. This
was discussed in (4.3.). However, noun juxtaposition is also used in its secon-
dary function of summing up nouns. In the following examples, it is logically
excluded that the juxtaposed nouns modify one another:(3713)   e'tay     tswa 'a-ki          a'xy-na
         woman man exist-DEC house-LOC
         ‘in the house there is a man and a woman’(3714)   ͅrjãwã-'na ã'rǊi a'?Ǌ 'a-ki
         forest-LOC tapir deer exist-DEC
         ‘in the forest there are tapirs and deer’In these examples, the coordinated nouns form a single noun phrase which rep-
resents an argument of the main predicate, but there is no explicit morphology
which indicates the coordination. Most numerals are also expressed as coordi-
nated elements (see 4.5.). Notice the following expression for ‘three’:(3715)   aky-'hͿ         e'mã
         two-NOM more
         ‘three’ (lit. ‘two and one more’)Note that emã by itself is also used to express ‘three’, but the complex numeral
does not mean ‘five’ (lit. ‘two and three’). Furthermore it is not a modification
construction meaning ‘two more’ or ‘six’ (lit. ‘twice three’). Since there is no
grammaticalised numeral system above ‘two’, numerals can be expressed in
different ways. Note the following expressions for ‘six’:(3716)   bwa-ko'je          e'mã
         end-CL:hand more
         ‘six’ (lit. ‘finished hand and one more’)(3717)   aky-'hͿ        aky-'hͿ     aky-'hͿ
         two-NOM two-NOM two-NOM
         ‘six’ (lit. ‘two and two and two’)These are also coordinated constructions which consist of juxtaposed nouns.
706    8. Subordination and coordination    Functional coordination of nouns can also be expressed by a cosubordina-
tive construction. The following example shows that this involves zero-
verbalisation:(3718)     'meza-na      kore'ja-tja di'hu-tse
           table-LOC knife-CSO spoon-DEC
           ‘on the table there are a knife and a spoon’In this example, one noun occurs as the root of a cosubordinated clause and the
other noun makes up the root of a matrix clause. Complex numerals can also be
expressed in this manner. Consider the following expression of ‘fifteen’:412(3719)     bwa-ko'je-tja         aky-ko'je-tse
           end-CL:hand-CSO two-CL:hand-DEC
           ‘fifteen’ (lit. ‘a hand ending it is two hands’)The expression of coordination through a cosubordinative construction is dis-
cussed extensively in (8.3.1.10.).
   Usually noun juxtaposition and zero-verbalisation are combined in order to
express a coordination construction. Notice the difference between (3718) and
the next example:(3720)     'meza-na      kore'ja di'hu-tse
           table-LOC knife          spoon-DEC
           ‘on the table there is a knife and spoon’Apparently, the zero-verbalisation has scope over both nouns. The structure of
(3720) is represented below by brackets:(3721)     'meza-na       [kore'ja di'hu]-tse
           table-LOC      [knife spoon]-DECIn the following examples, the second, coordinated noun is zero-verbalised as a
cosubordinated clause:(3722)     zjwãu    ho'Bİto-tja      mani'ni 'ja-wa-ki
           João     Roberto-CSO fish         eat-IS-DEC
           ‘João and Roberto eat fish’
412.This construction confirms the idea that the cosubordinative is ambiguous between
    subordinative and coordinative. It is subordinative in the sense that the clause ending
    in the cosubordinative mood functions as the equivalent of the English imperfective
    participle. It is coordinative in that the cosubordinative clause adds up an extra event
    to the event expressed by the matrix clause.

         ‘we two we are going to Barroso’The scope relations in (3723) can be symbolised as follows:(3725)   [si     xyi]-a-'ta     oja-'nã-a-ki       Ba'hozo-na
         [I      you]-1P-CSO go-FUT-1P-DEC        Barroso-LOC
         (lit. ‘we being you and me, we go to Barroso’)   The entire zero-verbalised noun phrase can be nominalised again:(3726)   'paulu ipe'pa-tsy-hͿ         huhui-'lİ-ki
         Paulo    Ipepa-GER-NOM beat-RECI-DEC
         ‘Paulo and Ipepa are fighting’This construction involves the gerundial morpheme -tsy- and is discussed ex-
tensively in (8.1.2.2.). The nominalised gerundial construction is often used if
the noun phrase is an object argument and requires case marking (see also
4.1.1.):(3727)   maga'riDa ͅ'hike-tsy-hͿ-'wã        'mİ̘-wa-ki

         you-GER-NOM-AO       I-GER-NOM-AO
         ‘Luzeu gave to Margarida, you and me (us)’   In the present section it is demonstrated that the function of coordination is
expressed by constructions of which the main function is something else. Jux-
taposition is mainly used to express modification, and cosubordination is
mainly used for clause chains. The function of coordination is only secondary,
and can only be expressed through these means when the context and “knowl-
edge of the world” allows it.
   In the following examples we see how noun coordination is avoided, and
how this function is expressed by a construction in which the matrix predicate
708    8. Subordination and coordinationis anticipated elliptically (under the omission of person, mood and, possibly,
different subject marking), by its root:(3729)    'ma-tjate      ho'ñe     a'ha-tjate ho'ñe-tja

          ‘I have neither bread (POR: pão) nor water’Kwaza does neither have a determiner with the meaning ‘neither’, nor one with
the meaning ‘each’. In the following example, ‘each’ is the unmarked interpre-
tation:(3731)    aky-'hͿ      e'mã-cwa-ta dai='dai-wa-ki    ('manga)
          two-NOM more-IS-CSO take=take-IS-DEC mango
          ‘two people took three (mangoes, each)’413There is no other way to express the difference with ‘together’, the opposite of
‘each’, than through a similar elliptic construction as in (3729) and (3730):(3732)    'peDro 'aky-hͿ        'dai zjwõ 'tei-hͿ 'dai 'tse ('manga)
          Pedro    two-NOM take João one-NOM take DEC mango
          ‘Pedro and João took three (mangoes, together)’414Maybe these elliptic constructions can be seen as involving juxtaposition of
sentences that receive inflexion only at the end of the entire “coordinated” con-
struction.","[739, 740, 741, 742, 743, 744, 745, 746]"

4.1.1.1. Transitivised verbsThe animate direct objects of verbs containing the transitivising morpheme -ta-

      ‘I showed/produced the knife (*to X)’However, the causative animate object does not always receive case. Compare
the following pairs of examples:(126) eto'hoi ku'nǊ-ki (*malene(wã))

      ‘the child is coughing’                ‘I made the child cough’Again, it is possible that the case marker has especially a disambiguating func-
tion. In (129) there can be no doubt about which argument is the subject be-
cause subject cross-reference makes this clear. In (127) there is only zero cross-
reference to both arguments. Nevertheless, similar causative constructions were
attested in which the animate object did not receive case:(130) ma'rija turwe-'dy-hͿ-ki          hy'riko'ro
      Maria heal-CAU-NOM-DEC           monkey
      ‘Maria cured the monkey’The following example suggests that case marking of causative indirect objects
is probably optional:(131) zjwãu(-wã) ja-'dy-da-ki
      João-AO      eat-CAU-1S-DEC
      ‘I fed João’
4.1.1.2. Ditransitive verbsWith common ditransitive verbs it is the indirect object which is usually
marked with the animate object marker, while the direct object remains un-
marked:(132) zjwãu-'wã ãwã'txi-da-ki          (133) zjwãu ãwã'txi-da-ki

      ‘give the chickens maize!’Note that under coordination of objects, only the last one is obligatorily case

      Marcio Luzeu-GER-NOM-AO give-2-DEC

      you-GER-NOM-AO I-GER-NOM-AO
      ‘Luzeu gave to Margarida, you and me (us)’  When transitive verbs are derived with causative -dy- it seems that the ani-
mate indirect objects are marked:(142) akǊ'cǊ-nahe're-wã a'wͿi-xa-xa-ki       (143) 'si-wã ãwͿi-'dy-ta?Ϳ-'ra

      ‘you are looking at the Indians’             ‘show it to me!’   In Kwaza, the transitive verb waja- ‘bring’ does not allow the expression of
an indirect object. It is made ditransitive through the morpheme -ta-. This in-
troduces a recipient object which then gets case marking:(144) dodotxi'mǊ wa'ja-da-ki       Ba'hOzO-na (*'mariju(-wã))

90. Wãzerip is a personal name in Salamãi which may be related to the word wanzet
    ‘woman, wife’ (Zack 1943, entry 35, Becker-Donner 1955:306).
114   4. The noun phrase4.1.1.3. Verbs which contain classifiersAlso the animate objects of transitive verbs which contain classifying mor-
phemes do get -wã, whether the classifier is lexicalised to the verb stem, as
seems a likely explanation for -ro in (127), or when it is not, as in (147):(146) luzeu-'wã hãrǊ'ro-da-ki         (147) zjwãu-'wã hado-'ri-da-ki
      Luzeu-AO strangle-1S-DEC              João-AO      pierce-CL:flat-1S-DEC
      ‘I strangled Luzeu’                   ‘I pierced João through the chest’(148) marija'Dite-wã haje-'kai-da-ki

      house(-AO) smear-NOM-1S-DEC
      ‘I painted (the house)’In the above examples one could argue that the animate objects are indirect
objects. Some verbs which contain classifiers do not allow case marked objects
at all, however, whether direct or indirect, whether animate or inanimate:(150) wara-'hͿ-da-ki         'paulu   (151) 'marju wara-'tu-da-ki

marked:(157) deda(-'wã)       ha'dai-da-ki        (158) hu'ri(-wã) oxote-'hͿ-da-ki

      ‘he (João) wants him (Pedro) to drink’But often this optionality is not unconditional:(165) zjwãu(-'wã) butxi-'nã-da-ki          (166) xyi-'wã butxi-'nã-da-ki
      João-AO      free-FUT-1S-DEC               you-AO free-FUT-1S-DEC
      ‘I’m going to free João’                   ‘I’m going to free you’If the object of the latter example were not marked for case it would make the
impression of a second person singular subject with wrong cross-reference
marking on the verb.
    With regard to the following examples, it may be that there is a different
sense involved in the presence and absence of -wã:(167) zjwãu(-wã) axe'hͿ-da-ki              (168) si(-wã)-'e
      João-AO      find-1S-DEC                   I-AO-too
      ‘I met (with) João’                        ‘I want (for me) too’
116   4. The noun phraseDepending on the verb stem to which it is applied, the (transitivising) verbal
morpheme -tja- (see 5.4.2.2.), which probably introduces objects of reason,
may allow or may require that the object is case marked with -wã. In the fol-
lowing examples, case marking is optional:(169) hu'ri(-wã) Ǌ'ca-da-ki
      paca-AO      ambush-1S-DEC
      ‘I’m hiding from the paca (ready to get it)’(170) hai'munDa(-'wã) we-'tja-da-ta           dyry'ry-da-ki
      Raimunda-AO         fear-TRA-1S-CSO     tremble-1S-DEC
      ‘I tremble with fear for Raimunda’In example (171) below and (1744) in section (5.4.2.2.), the obligatory combi-
nation of -tja- together with case marking yields a specific or determinate
sense:(171) de'da         'we-ki /     'we-tse
      anaconda fear-DEC /        fear-DEC
      ‘the snake is afraid’(172) deda-'wã          we-'tja-ki
      anaconda-AO fear-TRA-DEC
      ‘he is afraid of the snake’ (“only when seeing it”, not in general)Comparing the following examples, the combination of -tja- with case marking
is dependent on animacy:(173) wãwãwͿ-tja-'hͿ-da-ki        magariDa-'wã
      dream-TRA-NOM-1S-DEC        Margarida-AO

      ‘Mario is dreaming of sand’ (-wã optional because not a person)In the following examples containing -tja- applied to verbs of saying and or-
dering, the object is obligatorily marked for case:(175) pİ̘rİ̘jã-'tja-da-ki paulu-'wã    (176) ra.'tja-da-ki      maurilju-'wã

4.1.1.5. Interrogative objects marked by -wãIt seems that interrogative constructions with verbs of saying require question
words to be marked with -wã:(178) tsǊhǊ-ra'ti-wã jari'mã jã-'re

328    5. The verb phrase5.3.   DirectionalityIn section (4.2.8.) the attachment of classifiers to verb stems was discussed.
There is another type of morphological operation on Kwaza verb stems which
has a spatial or directional function. It replaces case markers and prepositions. I
have called it “directional”, after the terminology used by Craig for a similar
phenomenon in Mayan languages (1979:34) and by Hinton (1994:55-57) in the
native languages of California. An (either optional or obligatory) directional
morpheme specifies the directionality of the activity expressed by typical ac-
tion, process and motion verbs like “enter”, “take” and “put”. Kwaza direction-
als are almost exclusively marked on verbs. Some of the morphemes appear to
combine the functions of nominal classification and verbal directionality.
    Apart from certain distributional similarities between noun classifiers and
directionals, there is a structural parallellism. Similar to the way in which noun
classifiers can be attached to the empty root e- to form nouns, directionals can
be attached to the empty root a- in order to form adverbs (see 6.2.).
    Another characteristic of the application of a directional morpheme is that
the overt lexical expression of a “prepositional object”, which has to be in the
locative or instrumental case, is optional. This reminds one of the optionality of
an overt noun when that noun is specified by its classifier on the verb or on the
modifying dependent nominal. In some instances an overt prepositional object
was even rejected because in the verb, as the consultant explains: “you already
said everything”.
    The next subsection contains an inventory of morphemes that have been
identified as directionals by the examples. The subsequent subsection will dis-
cuss ambivalent forms which can function both as classifiers and directionals.","[365, 366]"
"
5.1.1. Remarks on the cross-reference forms and further examplesWith respect to table (22) above some remarks are in order. Firstly, most of the
object markers have to be combined with subject markers. Furthermore, some
object cross-reference forms are portmanteau morphemes. Finally, both third
person subjects and third person objects get zero morphological expression. In
the present section the constituent elements of cross-reference marking will be
discussed separately. First the subject forms will be dealt with, and then the
object forms, both in alphabetical order. Indefinite and impersonal argument
cross-reference will be dealt with in the separate sections (5.1.4.) and (5.1.5.)
respectively.
   Certain temporal and aspectual constructions are formed, among other
ways, through repetition, or perhaps better, reduplication of cross-reference
morphemes. In the remote past construction the reduplicated person markers
have a slightly different form and are best considered as allomorphs of the ca-
nonical person markers. These are discussed and demonstrated extensively in
(5.5.4.), and in the following sections I will only mention their existence and
their appearance.",[286]
"
5.5.11.   QuotationIn Kwaza, no distinction is made between direct and indirect reports. Maybe it
is even better to say that there is no indirect speech at all. Speech is quoted by
literally repeating what has been said. Furthermore, several other types of
“complementation” are also expressed in the form of reported speech.
    The construction is basically monoclausal. It consists of a predicate which
contains two levels of person and mood inflexion. The level which is closest to
the predicate root represents the quoted utterance, and the second level repre-
sents the inflexion of a verb of speech. Main stress is normally on the mood
marker of the level mentioned first, while the last syllable of the predicate root
retains secondary stress. Because no root of a verb of speech is present, the
construction is probably the result of ellipsis (see 5.5.11.1. and 7.5.). The fol-
lowing examples show how the construction works:(2015)    kukui'hͿ-da-'ki-tse
          ill-1S-DEC-DEC
          ‘she says she is ill’ (lit. ‘she says “I’m ill”‘)(2016)    maga'riDa kukui'hͿ-xa-'ki-tse
          Margarida ill-2-DEC-DEC
          ‘Margarida says you’re ill’(2017)    maga'riDa kukuihͿ-'ki-xa-ki
          Margarida ill-DEC-2-DEC
          ‘you say Margarida is ill’(2018)    kukui'hͿ-da-'ki-da-ki       (2019)     kukuihͿ-'ki-tse (*kukuihͿ-'ki-ki)
          ill-1S-DEC-1S-DEC                      ill-DEC-DEC
          ‘I said I am ill’                      ‘he says she is ill’These examples show that the verb with the first set of person and mood mark-
ers represents the actual utterance of the quoted person, whereas the second set
of person and mood markers identifies the quoted person and the illocutionary
status of the quoted utterance in the actual discourse context. The structure of
an example like (2018) can be represented as follows:(2020)    [[kukui'hͿ-da-'ki]-da-ki]       (lit. ‘“I am ill” (said) I’)

in a syntactic habitual construction of the form V-ta a- ‘use to V’. The gerun-
dial element -tsy- is used in the sense of ‘she said’ (see also 8.1.2.2.). Negative

involve verbs of ‘saying’. These constructions do not contain double layers of
person and mood marking. They just consist of juxtapositions of matrix

          ‘Hermes called me over for me to speak with Teteru’
          (lit. ‘Hermes called me, saying to me: “speak with Teteru!”‘)It seems reasonable to assume that the quoted speech construction originates
from this latter juxtapositive sentence construction. One could imagine that the
root of the verb for ‘to say’ is omitted, and that the remaining context depend-
ent person and mood markers are cliticised to the preceding fully inflected
quoted verb.
    Elliptic constructions in which the root of the quoted utterance, or the entire
quoted utterance itself, is omitted occur as well. In the following four exam-
ples, the omitted material is represented by “0”.(2041)    cutİ-da-'mͿ-Ø-tja

          ‘they said to me’Also, when one presents a combination of a person and mood marker in isola-
tion to a native speaker of Kwaza, and one asks what it means, he or she will
suggest several different possible interpretations, among them quoted speech:(2045)    cwa-'si
          IS-SWR
          ‘they did’, ‘it is said’, ‘they say’, ‘well then’, ‘now’ (t)   In (8.3.1.9.) the unlikeliness of the verb root ta- ‘talk’ as originating from a
reinterpreted cosubordinative mood marker -ta is discussed. Note the following
example:(2046)    hou'rje ta
          arrow       talk
          ‘(it is) called “arrow”‘One could hypothesise that this example originates from the following expres-
sion242:(2047)    hou'rje-ta
          arrow-CSO
          ‘it being an arrow’However, (2046) is more likely an elliptic utterance, be it a relatively rare one.
Normally, ta in the sense of ‘talk’ is also marked for person, mood and the like:(2048)    wari'ñǊ ta-'re
          solveira talk-INT
          ‘is it (the tree) called wari'ñǊ?’(2049)    ti-'nãi        kͅ'wͅ ƭkǊ'kǊ 'ta-nãi-re

occasions, and has become part of the transitive verb root tjata- ‘to speak to

         eat-FUT-2-INT-CSO       talk-1S-DEC

         ‘I’m asking you whether you ate’
         (lit. ‘“are you going to eat?” I said (to you)’)    Note that there are no verbs for ‘allowing’ or ‘forbidding’ in Kwaza. Such
senses are expressed through constructions in which imperatives and negative
imperatives are quoted. The verb root ratja- ‘to order’ and the imperative parti-
cle cara (see 5.2.3.4.) are also possible derivations of elliptic quotation con-
structions. Note the following examples:(2054)   ra'tja-ta-ki    wi'lena-na     oja-'ra-tja

not always concern literally reported speech. In the following examples, the
first person singular interrogative quoted by a first person singular is shown to
have a dubitative or ruminative function:(2058)   wara'ñͿ-e-da-tsy-'re-da-ki

         ‘I think I’m going to say no’   There is a quotation construction in which the quoting person is a first per-
son singular in a preconditional adverbial clause involving -lİ (see 8.2.1.3.1.):(2062)   kude're korİ-'ki=da-lİ            'ja-da-tsy-tse
         Kudere cleave-DEC=1S-PREC eat-1S-POT-DEC
         ‘(only) if Kudere/Canderé harvests (grubs), I will eat”
         (lit. ‘as soon as I’m aware that Kudere harvests, I will eat’)An English equivalent of this construction is probably something in the order
of ‘as far as I am concerned, I will eat if Canderé harvests the grubs’. The pre-
conditional value of the construction in (2062) it probably not very strong.
    In section (5.2.2.1.) various constructions in which the interrogative has an
emphatic function are discussed. One of these constructions seems to have ex-
tra emphasis when presented as quoted by the first person singular. Note the
following examples:(2063)   kukui 'cu=hy=hy-dwa-'re-da-hͿ-ki
         wow step=move=move-DR:onto-INT-1S-NOM-DEC
         ‘my, what a lot of tracks there were on the road!’

          wow     eat-INT-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘my, what did he eat much!’(2065)    ku'kui ja-xa-'re-da-hͿ-ki
          wow     eat-2-INT-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘my, what did you eat much! / how did you eat!’Literally, (2065) can be interpreted as ‘it is a fact that I said: “wow!, do/did you
eat?”‘. Such an interpretation resembles partially similar emphatic construc-
tions which consist of first person quotations in English, e.g. ‘I say, you know
how to eat!’.243 Apparently, this construction must contain a first person sub-
ject, since otherwise a more literal reading is obtained:(2066)    ku'kui ja-'re-xa-hͿ-ki
          wow       eat-INT-2-NOM-DEC
          ‘you said: “wow, he eats much!”’    The quotation construction is probably also the basis of the purposive con-
struction involving -te- (5.5.12.), the desiderative construction involving -heta-
(5.5.13.), the intentional construction involving -here- (5.5.14.1.) and the con-
struction involving apparential -tehere- (5.5.14.2.).
    Finally, the degrammaticalised occurrence of certain mood markers as mo-
dality morphemes may also derive from quotation constructions.","[440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447]"
"Headwords are only listed in their radical forms, with the following
consequences. Nouns and adverbs are presented as complete words. Verbs are
presented as uninflected underived roots, which end in a hyphen. Transparently
derived forms do not have separate entries but may be dealt with under the entry
of their root. There are also verb roots which require further derivation with
specific affixes from a very limited set. Since these root and affix combinations
are not completely lexicalised I have presented the bound or etymological roots
in separate entries, but without such affixes. Conversely, certain verb roots that
contain recognisable but truly fossilised or lexicalised morphological elements
are presented in separate entries. Affixes are presented as isolated elements in
separate entries. Apart from the two prefixes, all affixes start with a hyphen and,
in case they cannot occur word-finally, they also end with a hyphen.
    The first line of each entry starts with a Kwaza headword, or rather,
headform, followed by an abbreviation between brackets, which indicates the
grammatical category of the headform, and it ends in an English equivalent of the
headform. In the rest of the entry, more specific grammatical information is
given, and illustrated by Kwaza examples of use in italic print, followed by free
English translations in inverted commas. The examples of use are not always in a
strictly phonological spelling, and contain additional phonetic information, such
as multiple stress marking, length, deviating vowel and consonant qualities and
other idiosyncrasies.
    On certain occasions, forms are presented in phonetic spelling in square
brackets. Note that this does not involve the IPA alphabet as in the other parts of
the present description, but that it is based on the phonemic orthography.
Futhermore, italics are also used in this case. This means that e.g. /c/ is
symbolised as [t] in part I and II, and as [c] here in part III. The [B] and [D] in
part III represent the plosive [b] and [d], and [O] represents close-mid [o]. In a
816   Dictionarynumber of instances the family or the exact speaker who uttered a certain
example is specified by an abbreviation.
    Whenever forms from neighbouring languages to which I happened to have
access showed similarities to the Kwaza forms, these were usually added at the
end of the entry in italic print. In respect to Kwaza terminology for flora and
fauna species, I have tried to find the corresponding Western scientific
equivalents mainly via the Brazilian Portuguese translations obtained from
consultants, thus in an indirect manner. Unfortunately, identical popular names
are very often used for different species in different regions, and dictionaries and
handbooks are therefore often contradictory. It even seems possible that some
species may not have received a Western scientific name yet. Therefore there are
doubts about a number of Western equivalents of local names in the present
dictionary. In a number of cases I did not succeed to identify a Kwaza name with
a certain species at all. In case of doubt I added the Aikanã terms, if available,
even if they were not likely to be etymologically related to the Kwaza terms. The
usual order is: scientific terms (species, genus, family, order); Portuguese terms;
English terms, all whenever available.
    Portuguese loanwords are also included if they are not the result of code-
switching, but have clearly become naturalised, i.e. part of the Kwaza lexicon,
e.g. through phonological adaptation. Their Portuguese origin is always
indicated. In contrast to the Portuguese equivalents of scientific terms mentioned
above, Portuguese forms that can explain Kwaza forms are always in italics.
    Section (3.) below contains an English-Kwaza index to the preceding
vocabulary. Because of the broad meaning of certain headforms, a number of
Kwaza forms are repeated with alternative English translations. This is why the
index has a higher number of entries (nearly 2800) than the vocabulary. Within
certain translational domains, such as “stick” or “foot”, the different Kwaza
equivalents are alphabetised according to the order in the Kwaza alphabet, where
e.g. <y> occurs before <k> and <c> after <ts>.
    All abbreviations used in this dictionary are listed at the beginning of this
work. All bibliographical references encountered in the dictionary are included in
the list of references.

                             Indices of affixes
In these indices, affixes are listed in different manners. The first index contains all
known affixes, both inflexional and derivational, ordered according to their form
in the Kwaza alphabet (see part I, section 2.16.). The other indices are all ordered
alphabetically according to their meaning. Index (2.) contains all attested
classifying morphemes, the last few of which also have directional uses. Index (3.)
contains all attested directional morphemes the last few of which also have
classifying uses. Index (4.) contains the three affixes that have only demonstrative
use. Index (5.) contains the affixes that are attached to nouns and do not change
the word class. Index (6.) contains the affixes that are attached to verbs and do not
change the word class. Index (7.) contains affixes that either that change the
specific word class of their host, or that are not applied to a root of one word class
exclusively, or that do not determine the word class of their host. The
abbreviations express this in the following manner: (svv) concerns a suffix that is
attached to a verbal root and produces an extended verbal root or stem; (svn)
concerns a suffix that is attached to a verbal root and produces nominal root or
stem, etc. The abbreviations involved are: a = adverb; dem = demonstrative; n =
noun; p = prefix; s = suffix; v = verb; x = unspecified.","[853, 854, 855, 856, 857, 858, 859, 860, 861, 862, 863, 864, 865, 866, 867, 868, 869, 870, 871, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, 877, 878, 879, 880, 881, 882, 883, 884, 885, 886, 887, 888, 889, 890, 891, 892, 893, 894, 895, 896, 897, 898, 899, 900, 901, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 910, 911, 912, 913, 914, 915, 916, 917, 918, 919, 920, 921, 922, 923, 924, 925, 926, 927, 928, 929, 930, 931, 932, 933, 934, 935, 936, 937, 938, 939, 940, 941, 942, 943, 944, 945, 946, 947, 948, 949, 950, 951, 952, 953, 954, 955, 956, 957, 958, 959, 960, 961, 962, 963, 964, 965, 966, 967, 968, 969, 970, 971, 972, 973, 974, 975, 976, 977, 978, 979, 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985, 986, 987, 988, 989, 990, 991, 992, 993, 994, 995, 996, 997, 998, 999, 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014, 1015, 1016, 1017, 1018, 1019, 1020, 1021, 1022, 1023, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1036, 1037, 1038, 1039, 1040, 1041, 1042, 1043, 1044, 1045, 1046, 1047]"

5.2.3.4. Imperative particlesThe combination of the elements -ca- and -ra is also used independently in el-
liptic constructions (see also 7.5.2.):(1397)    R:     ja-'e-da-mͿ                    A:    ca-'ra
                 eat-again-1S-VOL                     EMP-IMP
                 ‘I’m going to eat again’             ‘do that!’, ‘yes!’The answer to the remark can be said to derive from the expression ja'?eca'ra
‘eat again!’ of which the stem is omitted. It is likely that this ellipsis led to the
emergence of an auxiliary-like verbal particle cara ‘order, send’:(1398)    zjwãu ca-'ra 'ta-ta-ki
          João EMP-IMP say-1O-DEC
          ‘João sent me’ (lit. ‘João said “go!” to me’)(1399)    zjwãu-'wã ca-'ra 'ta-da-ki
          João-AO       EMP-IMP say-1S-DEC
          ‘I sent João’
308   5. The verb phrase    In a similar fashion the verb-like particle ratja ‘order him’, ‘insist’ must
have emerged. In this case the imperative morpheme -ra functions as the root,
in a fixed combination with -tja-, which probably originates from a transitiv-
iser. ratja- shows more resemblance to a normal transitive verb stem than does
cara:(1400)   ratja-'ra                (1401)      e-'nƭ-da-ta        ra'tja-da-'ki
         order-IMP                            go-CAUS-1S-CSO order-1S-DEC
         ‘send him!/tell him to!’             ‘I ordered him to go home’(1402)   'si-dy-hͿ     tã'jã ra'tja-ta-hͿ-'lİ 'nãi-da-ki
         I-POS-NOM chief order-1O-NOM-PREC like-1S-DEC
         ‘the chief told me to do like this’However, ratja is also encountered as an uninflected particle in the following
example:(1403)   zjo'ze ra'tja zjwã-'wã dy-'ta    cari=a'sa-hͿ-ki             kaBrije-'wã
         José order João-AO DS-CSO shoot=leave-NOM-DEC                Gabriel-AO
         ‘José made (that) João kill(ed) Gabriel’
5.2.4. ExhortativeThe verb-final exhortative morpheme -ni is pronounced as [ni] or [nƭ]. It can be
applied to verbs cross-referring to the first person inclusive subject by -a-, in-
definite subject by -wa and zero-marked third person subject.(1404)   ka'we     kui-'ni            (1405)     ka'we     'kui-wa-ni
         coffee drink-EXH                        coffee drink-IS-EXH
         ‘let him have coffee!’                  ‘let them have coffee!’
         (whether he wants it or not)            (also ‘make coffee for them’)(1406)   hã     'kui-a-ni              (1407)    'ja-a-ni       Bis'koito
         water drink-1P-EXH                      eat-1P-EXH biscuit
         ‘let us drink!’                         ‘let’s eat biscuits’(1408)   jere'xwa na'nãi-tja kahİ-'ni etohoi-'wã
         jaguar very-CSO bite-EXH child-AO
         ‘that’s O.K., let the dog bite the child!’The transitive verb in the exhortative mood can bear any object cross-reference
marker:
                                                                      5.2. Mood   309(1409)   awe-mǊ-'ko          haha-'djo-hata-'ni
         rain-CL:liquid-INS wash-CL:foot-3S.2O-EXH
         ‘let the rain wash your foot!’The exhortative is almost never combined with future -nã-; compare *ja'nã?ani
to (1407). Only one instance of this combination was attested:(1410)   tokoi'ri-a-ki     ka'wİ    kui-'nã-a-ni
         tired-1P-DEC coffee drink-FUT-1P-EXH
         ‘we’re tired, let’s have coffee!’Unlike the declarative and imperative, the exhortative shows no extraordinary
morphological behaviour in combination with the procrastinative morpheme
-tara- ‘later’:(1411)   'ja-a-tara-ni                   (1412)     here?ece-hͿ-wa-tara-'ni
         eat-1P-PROC-EXH                            rest-NOM-IS-PROC-IMP
         ‘let’s eat first’                          ‘let him rest first!’(1413)   here?ece-hͿ-tara-'ni
         rest-NOM-PROC-IMP
         ‘let (us leave) him to rest first!’(1414)   aru-ce-'wa-tara-hͿ-ta            he're?ece-hͿ-tara-ni
         put-CL:hole-IS-PROC-NOM-CSO rest-NOM-PROC-EXH
         ‘put (the porridge) into the mortar first, for it to rest first!’ (t)A verb in the exhortative mood can function as the matrix verb of the sentence
and have cosubordinate phrases:(1415)   atxi'txi mani'ni-tsy-hͿ hu'de-a-ta 'ja-a-ta          'a-a-ni
         maize fish-GER-NOM dry-1P-CSO eat-1P-CSO exist-1P-EXH
         ‘let’s live (there) and dry maize and eat fish!’ (t)
5.2.4.1. -nƭ- as a causational bound modal morphemeThe exhortative has a purposive sense in certain constructions:(1416)   e'nãi-ca-ra          bui-'ni
         quarrel-EMP-IMP leave-EXH
         ‘quarrel so that (the dog) leaves (the house)!’
310   5. The verb phrase(1417)   dytenã-'ra       wã'wͿi-a-ni
         extinguish-IMP sleep-1P-EXH
         ‘extinguish the candle so we can get some sleep!’(1418)   dyte'nã-a-ni         wã'wͿi-wa-ni
         extinguish-1P-EXH sleep-IS-EXH
         ‘let’s extinguish the candle so they can get some sleep!’In other constructions -ni may be considered as a purposive or causational mo-
dal morpheme: -nƭ- ‘to make (someone do something)’, which is pronounced
[nƭ] rather than [ni]. It occurs often, but not necessarily, in subordinate con-
structions and it has a valency-increasing effect:(1419)   'mã-da-ki onİ-'nƭ-da-'ta
         call-1S-DEC come-CAUS-1S-CSO
         ‘I call her to come’(1420)   i'tso       si-'nã-da-ki  wãwͿi-'nƭ-da-ta
         hammock tie-FUT-1S-DEC sleep-CAUS-1S-CSO
         ‘I’m hanging up the hammock so I can sleep’(1421)   haru'?i ja-dy-'nã-da-ki         oja-'nƭ-da-ta
         Luiz     eat-CAU-FUT-1S-DEC go-CAUS-1S-CSO
         ‘I’m going to give Luiz food so that he can leave’(1422)   erme-(*'wã)     aky-'nƭ-da-ta     unͿtse-'hͿ-da-ki
         Hermes-(*AO) take-CAUS-1S-CSO wait-NOM-1S-DEC
         I’m waiting for Hermes to take food first’In these causational constructions, the sentential subject is not identical with
the embedded agentive subject of the verb root. In (1419) subject of onİ- ‘to
come’ is not expressed by cross-reference marking. However, the subject of
onİnƭ- ‘to make him come’ is. Compare the following examples:(1423)   kuraku'ra ja-'dy-da-ki            Ǌi-'nƭ-da-ta
         chicken       eat-CAU-1S-DEC lie-CAUS-1S-CSO
         ‘I feed the chickens so that they can sleep’(1424)   kuraku'ra ja-'dy-da-ki            Ǌi-'nã-da-ta
         chicken       eat-CAU-1S-DEC lie-FUT-1S-CSO
         ‘I feed the chickens so that I can go to sleep’
                                                                             5.2. Mood   311Causational -nƭ- occurs often as an answer to exhortatives like (1404):(1425)     'ja       kui-'nƭ-da-ki
           already drink-CAUS-1S-DEC
           ‘I already let (him) drink’It also occurs in certain, relatively fixed, expressions:(1426)     'ƭ     wai-hͿ-'nƭ-cwa-ta='nãi
           idly good-NOM-CAUS-IS-CSO=like
           ‘for no reason, to make beautiful, that’s how they do’ (t)(1427)     ti-nãi-ƭ-'nƭ-xa-ta          'ja-xa-re
           what-NOM-NEG-CAUS-2-CSO eat-2-INT
           ‘why do you eat (peppers)?’Notice that on the following transitive verb, the causational appears to function
as a reflexive, with the connotation of ‘to do by accident’:(1428)     hadai-'nͿ-da-ki                      (1429)     hadai-'nƭ-da-ki
           hack-REF-1S-DEC                                 hack-CAUS-1S-DEC
           ‘I cut myself (on purpose)’                     ‘I cut myself (by accident)’    Because this construction involving -nƭ- is the result of post-cliticising com-
plementation similar to the reported speech construction, it will also be dis-
cussed in (5.5.15.). The causational construction resembles the volitional con-
struction with -damͿ- ‘to want’ discussed in (5.2.5.1.). An important difference
is that the causational morpheme is never preceded by subject cross-
reference.183
5.2.4.2. Exhortative paucal -ja-An alternative exhortative construction involving the element -ja(-) is sus-
pected to have a paucal connotation.(1430)     (txi'rja) mamañe-'ja (txi'rja) mama'ñe-a-'ni
           everyone sing-EXP       everyone sing-1P-EXH
           ‘let us (two or three persons) sing!’‘let us (many, all) sing!’It is encountered only with a first person inclusive subject and not with any
other persons or moods: *İ'jadaki, *İ'jaki. It usually occurs verb-finally be-
having as a mood marker.","[345, 346, 347, 348, 349]"
"
8.2.2.2. Frustrative and antithetic -le-(hͿ)-There is an “antithetic” or “counterfactual” concessive construction that one
could call the frustrative. It employs the elements -le-(hͿ)- in various ways. The
frustrative element -le- often indicates that a certain situation in the past does
not obtain any more, or that something has “nearly” happened. In combination
with nominaliser -hͿ(-) there can be a connotation of regret. It has not been es-
tablished whether frustrative -le- is related to preconditional -lİ or concessive
-lete.
    The subordinate clause may contain clause-final -le-hͿ while the matrix
verb is in the declarative:
                                                        8.2. Adverbial clauses   641(3396)   rai'hͿ-le-hͿ          hyhy'rwa-nãi 'wai-ki
         ruin-FRUST-NOM move-NOM                 good-DEC
         ‘it (the bridge) is ruined, but (still) good to walk’The subordinate clause in the above example is in a way counterfactual because
the bridge does not appear to be totally ruined. Despite of the impression it
might make one can still walk across. The next example shows that neither an-
titheticity nor counterfactuality are strict, formal-semantic requirements of
frustrative subordination:(3397)   ywy'nwͿ      'dy=asa-'nã-da-le-hͿ              'tãi-ki
         tree         cut=leave-FUT-1S-FRUST-NOM hard-DEC
         ‘I was going to cut away the tree trunk, but it was (too) hard’The subordinate clause in the above example is “antithetic” in that the enter-
prise of cutting away the tree trunk did not have the intended result. It was lit-
erally frustrated because of the hardness of the timber. A situation of similar
antithetic calibre holds in the following example:(3398)   jere'xwa wai'hͿ ã'wͿi-da-le-hͿ               'nã-hͿ-ki
         jaguar nice         see-1S-FRUST-NOM         stink-NOM-DEC
         ‘I saw a beautiful dog but it stank’   The antithetic sense can be reinforced by the intentional conjectural -here-
(see 5.5.14.):(3399)   wai-'he-tsy-hͿ-here-da-le-hͿ                 'wai-ki
         good-NEG-GER-NOM-INTL-1S-FRUST-NOM good-DEC

         wild-INTL-1S-FRUST-NOM
         ‘I thought it was wild (but it is a domestic cat)’   The entire combination -le-hͿ- may also be part of a matrix verb. Often it
express the fact that some situation existed in the past but not any more in the
present. In this way it functions as an aspect marker of arrested progression
(see 5.5.18.):(3401)   emǊ'hͿ-le-hͿ-'ki

         ‘it was wet’ (CX: it has already dried)

          still    arrive-NEG-2-time move-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘I walked a while before you arrived’ (but not thereafter)This sense of ‘situation that obtained in the past and was interrupted’ may also
have a connotation of ‘unfortunately’, ‘what a pity’. The subject in the next ex-
ample is unfortunate because the cigarette ended:(3405)    ui       'hu-le-hͿ-ki
          tobacco smoke-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘he was smoking (but the cigarette ended) unfortunately’The next example apparently does not refer to a past situation, but there is an
antithetic implication in the unfortunate dilemma which it expresses:(3406)    haru'wi ja-a-tsy-'tse-tsy-le-hͿ-ki
          Luiz      eat-1P-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘Luiz invited us/me for dinner, now what to do?’Literally this sentence involves a quotative construction meaning ‘unfortu-
nately Luiz said “we are going to eat”‘. The dilemma lies in the fact that the
hearer and his companion had different plans, but they can impossibly decline
his offer. The following examples also contain quotative constructions and an-
tithetic implications:(3407)    hã    mǊi-tsy-'tse-da-le-'hͿ-ki

          ‘he said I had to get water, but it’s a pity (it’s not possible)’364364.Remember that potential -tsy- has a mitigated imperative connotation here, and that a
    second person is expressed optionally in this construction. Note also that the ‘com-
    mand’ is embedded in a quoted speech construction, which is why the subject of the
    embedded verb is ultimately a first person object on the discourse-pragmatic level.

         water submerge-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM perforate-DEC
         ‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’In example (3409) the antithetic phrase is a subordinated adverbial clause,
whereas in (3408) it is part of the matrix verb. The contrast between examples
(3408) and (3409) (repeated from 1375) suggests that the occurrence of -le-hͿ(-
) inside the matrix clause represents a zero-verbalised noun-phrase rather than
an extension of the verb by a verbalising suffix. In fact, it may corroborate the
hypothesis that subordinate clauses in Kwaza are noun phrases.
    -le-hͿ(-) is an analysable combination of different morphemes. In the first
place, -hͿ may be replaced by a specific classifier (see 4.2.):(3410)   a'xy ͅ'hike    'a-tsy-le-xy
         house Henrique exist-GER-FRUST-CL:house
         ‘the house where Henrique lived’ (t)In the second place, the element -hͿ plays a role in nominalisation, which may
produce relative clause-like phrases (see 8.4.1.1.):(3411)   Ǌcenãi-'he-da-hͿ      ere'we-da-ki
         know-NEG-1S-NOM write-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m writing up what I don’t know’Such a nominalised phrase can be zero-verbalised again by the application of a
mood marker:(3412)   si 'kui-da-hͿ-ki         hã         (*kuihͿdaki)
         I drink-1S-NOM-DEC water
         ‘it is me who drank water’365In comparison with the preceding example the element -le- in the next example
may seem to have a sense of an ongoing action in the past which was inter-
rupted at some point (see 5.5.18.):(3413)   si 'kui-da-le-hͿ-ki           hã
         I drink-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC water
         ‘it was me who was drinking water’366The contrast between the next examples in which the element -hͿ does not oc-
cur, also suggests that the element -le- has a sense of interrupted continuous
action:365.MA in POR: eu que tomei agua
366.MA in POR: foi eu que tava tomando

           ‘why did you give it?’367                   ‘why were you giving it?’368Canonically, the part -le- by itself creates the antithetic sense of ‘nearly’:(3416)     hy'ja-da-le-ki
           fall-1S-FRUST-DEC
           ‘I nearly fell’The sense of ‘nearly’ is semantically related to the notion of ‘frustrative’ be-
cause it refers to the fact that something which was about to happen did not
happen after all, whether this is fortunate or not. Sometimes, a verb ending in
frustrative -le-hͿ can express this notion:(3417)     rai'hͿ-tsy-le-hͿ
           ruin-GER-FRUST-NOM
           ‘it having nearly broke’Sometimes, -le has a ‘frustrative’ connotation by itself:(3418)     hako'ro mãdu'tu-da-le-(hͿ)-ki

           ‘it was for bathing (but now it has broke down)’369In a non-antithetic context -le helps to express ‘pity’ and ‘regret’ (see also
5.5.18.)(3421)     'sopa 'wai-le-ki           'bwa-tse
           soup nice-FRUST-DEC finish-DEC

          ‘it is a pity that they killed him with his long hair’370The overall meaning of -le-(hͿ-) is probably that something is not the case even
though it was the case once in the past, or even though it was expected to be the
case. This is the reason why I have discussed -le-(hͿ-) as part of the concessive
category. A verb may contain -le- with this aspect-like meaning, but it can also
be nominalised and then function as a concessive clause. The concessive clause
can be subordinated to a matrix clause, or it can be incorporated in the matrix
clause through zero-derivation.
    Under ellipsis (see 7.5.) of the preceding verb stem or a quoted expression,
-(tsy)-le-hͿ- can occur as a root with context dependent meaning:(3423)    le-'hͿ-ki                          (3424)    tsy-le-'hͿ-ki
          FRUST-NOM-DEC                                GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘yes’, ‘he wanted to’,                       ‘what a pity’ (as e.g. in the
          ‘he was saying’                              context of (3406/3158))(3425)    xa-le-'re
          2-FRUST-INT
          ‘you would like?’ (t)
8.2.2.3. The concessive element -waraThere is another type of concessive construction that is realised through what
looks like subordination of two clauses by an intervening conjunctional ele-
ment (-)wara, roughly translated as ‘but’. The morphological status of this
element is not entirely clear. On the one hand it behaves like an independent
particle, but on the other hand it is very frequently connected to the nominaliser
-hͿ, where it acts as a bound morpheme. In this construction, -hͿ may have
scope over a wide array of phrases from verb roots and independent nouns to
fully-fledged verbal clauses. In this way, -hͿ forms a phonological unit together
with -wara, and may behave as if it were an independent coordinating particle
hͿwara ‘but’.
    In the present analysis, the “but”-concessive clause is regarded as a nomi-
nalised verb that is subordinated to a matrix clause. In these respects, it is
similar to other adverbial clauses. It differs from the other constructions in that
the “but”-concessive clause requires an extra element wara in order to be sub370.This example relates to our mysterious friend Saravi. No-one in Rondônia had been
    able to establish his ethnic identity. He was shot dead in 1995 in Vilhena by a
    rancher for something he did not do. Note that the first -le in this example means
    ‘only, just’ (‘nothing but hair’).
646   8. Subordination and coordinationordinated to the matrix clause. Under the analysis of wara as a cliticised parti-
cle, this concessive construction can be regarded as an analytical equivalent of
the more synthetic concessive construction with -lete, which was discussed in
(8.2.2.1.).
    The following examples represent the most basic occurrence of the “but”-
concessive:(3426)   hy'ja-hͿ=wara        kãu-'he-tse
         fall-NOM=but         break-NEG-DEC
         ‘fell but did not break’(3427)   kwa'za-dy-nãi are'ta-da-hͿ=waraja     mãrİ̘'?a-dy-nãi

         ‘although I know the Kwaza language, I already understand the

         know-NEG-1S-DEC
         ‘listening I understand (a little), but speaking I don’t’(3429)   i'si-tsͿ-hͿ=wara        da'nͿ-ki
         die-POT-NOM=but         still-DEC
         ‘it’s wounded but it is still living’(3430)   ãwͿi-rjͿ-'he-tsy-hͿ=wara           aru-nͿ-tõi-'he-tse
         see-CD:area-NEG-GER-NOM=but place-REF-CL:eye-NEG-DEC
         ‘he does not see but does not use glasses. / he does not see, neverthe-
         less he does not use glasses’In the above examples, the verbal base of the subordinate clause was nomi-
nalised by -hͿ and subordinated to the matrix clause through cliticisation of
wara. In the following example, -hͿ- is a lexicalised part of the verbal base
waihͿ- ‘to be beautiful’. Instead of a subsequent nominaliser, =wara is at-
tached to the verbal base immediately:(3431)   kwa'za-dy-nãi      wai.'hͿ=wara are'ta-da-rai-he-ki
         Kwaza-POS-NOM beautiful=but understand-1S-damn-NEG-DEC
         ‘Kwaza is beautiful but I don’t know a thing’
                                                     8.2. Adverbial clauses   647The expected form *waihͿhͿwara was rejected. This example suggests above
all that although the combination of wai- ‘to be good’ with the element -hͿ- has
a lexicalised meaning of ‘be beautiful’, the same element -hͿ- has preserved
certain grammatical functions. Here, it combines its lexicalised status with its
nominalising subordinating status.
    Note that the predicate of the concessive clause may also be nominalised by
another morpheme such as the temporal nominaliser -wy:(3432)   si aky'nͿda'nͿ     ja-'he-da-wy=wara 'İ-tse
         I friend still     eat-NEG-1S-time=but go-DEC
         ‘(my) friend went away while I had not yet eaten’   The next examples show that in combination with wara, the nominaliser can
have the scope over an entire sentence in the declarative mood. Arguments em-
bedded in the concessive clause may even intervene between its predicate and
the concessive particle:(3433)   oja-e'te-da-tsy-tse       zezƭju-dy-'rjͿ      hͿ=wa'ra
         go-COMIT-1S-POT-DEC       Zezinho-POS-DC:area NOM=but         he'?ai -da-ki
         want.not-1S-DEC
         ‘we are going together to Zezinho, but I don’t want to, no’(3434)   e'tay     eto'hoi a'sa-tse       hͿ=wara huru'ja-lİ-ki
         woman child         leave-DEC NOM=but like-RECI-DEC
         ‘he left wife and children, but nevertheless they loved each other very
         much’These examples suggest of course that -hͿ is not a bound nominalising mor-
pheme any more, but that it has obtained a semi-independent status. If the dis-
course context allows, the conjunctional “particle” can even be “inflected” for
person.(3435)   da-hͿ=wa'ra mãrİ̘'?a-dy-nãi       pİ̘rİ̘'jã-nãi 'e-da-ki
         1S-NOM=but spirit-POS-NOM         speak-NOM have-1S-DEC
         ‘nevertheless I know the Western man’s language’Possibly, the verb root that originally preceded -dahͿwara is understood and
has been omitted. These phenomena of ellipsis and cliticisation were further
discussed in (7.5.). In the following example, hͿwara is used even more inde-
pendently:
648   8. Subordination and coordination(3436)   hͿ=wa'ra     hu-'ra
         NOM=but      smoke-IMP
         ‘nevertheless, smoke!’It was said in a situation in which the hearer had declined an offered smoke but
where the speaker insisted. Here it is possible to maintain that nothing is omit-
ted, but that hͿwara is used as a context-dependent pragmatic particle. In an-
other situation the speaker uttered hͿwara as a single phrase in the figurative
sense of ‘never mind’ or ‘it is no problem’. Here the speaker had offered the
visiting hearer his hammock but the hearer had objected that he had come in
from the rain and that his clothes were wet. The speaker again reacted to this by
hͿwara ‘never mind’. As an equivalent expression he could also have said
na'nãi?Ϳky'wy ‘it is O.K. like that’.
    In quoted speech constructions the concessive conjunction can be realised
through the extended particle tsyhͿwara ‘think that, but’ (see 5.5.11.). There
are other conditions which relate to the element -tsy-. In (8.1.2.3.) it is ex-
plained how -hͿ cannot be preceded immediately by future -nã-, but that -tsy-
has to intervene. This requirement also holds for hͿwara:(3437)   wãwͿi-'nã-tsy-hͿ=wara            tsile'ta    tsile'ta-tja
         sleep-FUT-GER-NOM=but            afternoon   afternoon-CSO         a'wͿi=xare-ri'tsa-hͿ=wara          jerexwa-'le
         see=turn-DR:outside-NOM=but jaguar-only
         ‘(..., and) went to sleep, but early in the night she looked outside, but
         there was a jaguar!’ (t)Notice with respect to the latter example also that the difference between the
subject of the but-clause and the matrix clause does not require formal mark-
ing.
   Notice with respect to the counterfactual concessive example (3348) in
(8.2.1.2.1.) that the but-clause can also refer to a possible non-realised fact.","[678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686]"

3.3.1. IntroductionThe order of placement of the constituents in Kwaza clauses and phrases is
relatively free. In several footnotes throughout the present description, alterna-
tive word orders have been indicated by numbers. In such footnotes, word or-
der in the original sentence is implicitly symbolised as 1, 2, 3, etc., in numeri-
cal order from left to right. When an alternative word order of the same exam-
ple is attested, this is represented by a non-numerical order of these numbers,
100    3. Parts of speech and constituent ordere.g. in notes such as “order 3-1-2 is also permitted” or “order 2-3-1 is ungram-
matical”. Notice the footnote that goes with the following example:(28) Ǌmã'tİ-da-ki manini-tsu-'mãi          'ko-hͿ-tİ
     fish-1S-DEC     fish-CL:bone-CL:tooth empty-NOM-NOM
     ‘I fished without a hook’83The footnote indicates that the constituents of example (28) can occur in the
following alternative order:(29) manini-tsu-'mãi        'ko-hͿ-tİ    Ǌmã'tİ-da-ki
     fish-CL:bone-CL:tooth empty-NOM-NOM fish-1S-DEC
     ‘I fished without a hook’No goal-oriented research was done on word order in Kwaza. In most cases it
is not known what the exact semantic or pragmatic difference is between the
alternative word orders. In some cases it was observed that the first constituent
of a sentence receives focus. Of alternatives which were declared by my con-
sultant to be ungrammatical, or less felicitous than others, it has not been es-
tablished to what extent this is the case, and whether this really depends on
word order or on other factors.","[137, 138]"

8.1.1.1. Potential and person markingConstructions involving potential -tsy- can be marked for any subject person,
including second person singular and plural -xa-. If a person marker is absent,
however, the verb may be ambiguous. Often, zero marking in potential verbs
cross-refers to third persons, but in the ambiguous cases it can also refer to sec-
ond persons. The difference between -xa- and zero-marking for second persons
in verbs containing potential -tsy- is not entirely clear.
    Meanwhile, zero-marked potential verbs ending in -tse are declarative when
the subject is a third person. However, when the zero-marked subject is a sec-
ond person, the verb may have an imperative connotation. As demonstrated in
(5.2.3.) verbs bearing the canonical imperative mood marker -ra may cross-
refer to a singular subject (which is intrinsically a second person) by either zero
or -xa-. It was also demonstrated that in comparison to the canonical impera-
tive, the potential morpheme -tsy- may have a mitigated imperative interpreta-
tion. The examples below and in (5.2.3.1.) suggest that the presence or absence
of second person marker -xa- does not determine this mitigated imperative ef-
fect. On some occasions both potential verbs in which -xa- is present and in
which it is absent (though with a second person interpretation) could be re-
garded as (mitigated) imperative:

         ‘say it if (the food) isn’t good!’          *?”moon, become full!’The latter example was considered anomalous for obvious reasons. Notice that
it was not regarded as a correct third person form of a verb in which -tsy- has a
future interpretation. Compare examples (1463) and (1464) in section (5.2.5.1.)
for the correct version of this.
    In contrast to what the above examples suggest, second person marking in
combination with potential does not always have an imperative effect. The
following example shows that it may have just a future effect:(3240)   i'si-xa-tsy-tse
         die-2-POT-DEC
         ‘you may die’ (CX: what happens if you eat this mushroom?)It is nevertheless possible that zero marked second person potential verbs may
also have just the future effect. Unfortunately, the following examples were
elicited and translated in isolation and it was not possible to inquire explicitly
about their connotations:(3241)   kui-da'mͿ-(xa)-tsy-tse    /   kui-'nã-(xa)-tsy-tse
         drink-want-2-POT-DEC /        drink-FUT-2-POT-DEC
         ‘you’re planning to drink’Zero-marked verbs in the potential seem to cross-refer to second person sub-
jects with or without the imperative effect. Without imperative effect they ei-
ther refer to second or to third person subjects. This implies that the absence or
presence of -xa- is not fully predictable and that there is room for ambiguity

following table:Table 31. Person cross-reference marking with declarative potential -tsy-

a purposive function:(3248)   cͅrͅ'mǊ e'hͿ-da-mͿ  'kui-da-tsy-hͿ                  eto'hoi-nahe're

tains its valency, and may have embedded lexical arguments. On a morpho-
logical level, these are arguments of that verb stem. However, the internal syn-
tactic structure of the purposive clause is identical to that of a nominal modifi-
cation construction in which the dependent and the (omissible) head are juxta-
posed (see 4.3. and 8.4.1.5.). On a sentence level the adverbial clause is a bene-
ficiary argument satellite of the matrix verb. In the following purposive clauses
the lexical heads represent the subject, object and instrumental satellite argu-
ments, respectively, of the verb stem embedded in the dependent:(3250)   eto'hoi-nahere erewe-tsy-'hͿ

           ‘grubs to breed grubs with’In the following example the object of the matrix verb could be regarded as the
subject of the purposive clause, although this clause can also be regarded ex-
clusively as an adverbial phrase:(3254)     e-si'ki      'bİta-'nã-da-ki    ka'ra-tsy-hͿ
           Ø-CL:skin hang-FUT-1S-DEC dry-POT-NOM
           ‘I’m going to hang out the clothes to dry’In the following example the object of the cosubordinated clause is identical to
the subject of the verbal root of the purposive nominal which functions as the
stem of the matrix verb (‘João’):(3255)     talo-'tja-dy-ta    'İ-tsy-hͿ-ki      zjwãu
           sulk-TRA-DS-CSO go-POT-NOM-DEC João
           ‘by sulking (ignoring him) she made João go away’A literal reading of this example could be: ‘she sulked with João in order for
him to leave’, and the effect appears to be causative.352
    The contrast between the next two examples shows that, instead of nomi-
naliser -hͿ, a specific classifier (see 4.2.) can be applied. This faculty of classi-
fiers to represent specific nominals morphologically, is interconnected with the
phenomenon of omissible heads. The result is an even more synthetic con-
struction in which the head (‘board’) has in a sense “incorporated” the descrip-
tive dependent (‘for you to make a house’):(3256)     a'xy-dy-'xa-tsy-tse

           house-CAU-2-POT-CL:oblong see-1S-DEC
           ‘I saw boards for you to make a house with’Notice that the latter example does not contain an adverbial clause. It illustrates
that a nominalised potential verb may have an internally purposive meaning,
even although on the sentential level it may be just a Patiens object argument of
the matrix verb. The next example illustrates that this “incorporation” also ap352.In an alternative analysis, -tsy- can be interpreted as gerundial, which would yield the
    translation ‘the fact that he is/was treated bad is/was a reason for João to leave’. It is
    difficult to say what the best interpretation is.
                                                              8.1. The form -tsy-   613plies to the referent of the nominaliser -hͿ, which can be regarded as a neutral
classifier:(3258)    areta-'dy-ja-tsy-hͿ              /   erewe-xy-'dy-ja-tsy-hͿ

          ‘teacher, professor’As a consequence, the literal translation of this word should be ‘a non-descript
person in order to make people know, c.q. in order to make people write’.353 In
general one may say that a verb which is nominalised by the combination of the
potential morpheme -tsy- with any classifier has become a “purposive noun”.
   It is important to notice that nominalisation of a potential verb does not al-
ways yield a purposive noun, though it retains a future sense:(3259)    o'kja-a-xa-(tara)-tsy-hͿ-herejã-'re

          path end-POT-CD:area lie-1S-DEC
          ‘I rested at the end of the road’ (lit. where it will end)   The nominaliser -nãi is not a classifier. -nãi can be used to derive action
nouns from verbs and to create adverbs. The combination -tsy-nãi yields an ac-
tion noun that functions as an uncertain future complement clause (see 8.4.2.):(3262)    Ǌcenãi-'he-da-ki o'nİ-da-tsy-nãi

    comfort in the fact that formal education is not a native concept among the Kwaza.

8.1.2. Gerundi(v)al -tsy-In certain positions inside the verb the element -tsy- clearly does not have a
potential sense and it can apparently not be related to the potential morpheme
-tsy- dealt with in the preceding section. The unidentified element -tsy- seems
to be another morpheme with a different meaning, but its exact semantic con-
tents are difficult to establish. Depending on the semantics of the specific verb
stem to which it is attached it may have a durative, progressive or resultative
effect, but its principal function is mildly emphatic. Because it is usually fol-
lowed by a nominaliser, and because this combination replaces declarative -tse
on many occasions, I have analysed it provisionally as a gerundial morpheme:(3266)   lo'te e-'he-tse                  (3267)    lo'te e-'he-tsy-hͿ
         door have-NEG-DEC                          door have-NEG-GER-NOM
         ‘there is no door’                         ‘without door’There could be a morphophonological relation between -tsy- and declarative
-tse. The main reason why -tsy- is not regarded here as an outright allomorph of
-tse is because -tse is analysed as a verb-final mood marker. If a verb is nomi-
nalised, the mood marker is normally truncated and replaced by the nominalis-
ing morpheme. Nevertheless, formal, distributional and perhaps semantic cor-
respondences warrant the suspicion that gerundial -tsy- may derive from de-
clarative -tse.
    Example (3267) above means literally: ‘the one not having a door’. It is
possible that -tsy- has an emphatic cleft function. In the following examples,
-tsy- causes contrastive focus:(3268)   nͿ-'xy-tsy-hͿ

         ‘the big house’ (lit. ‘that which functions as a big house’)(3269)   xyi tei-'hͿ-tsy-hͿ           a'wͿi-xa-ki

one do you want?’. The fact that -hͿ is a nominaliser which can be replaced by
a specific classifier (see also 4.2.) is a reason to regard -tsy- as an element
which is not inextricably fused with -hͿ:(3270)    koreja'ri      nͿ-'ri-tsy-ri

          grass-only-GER-CD:area
          ‘(while) being a place with only grass’ (t)Further evidence that -hͿ is nominaliser here is that it can be marked for case:(3275)    ywy'nwͿ    kara-ko'ro-tsy-hͿ-na               mau'ru     'Ǌ-ki

tire phrase can function as a dependent relative clause-like nominal (‘one with-
out an arm’) modifying a juxtaposed nominal head (‘shirt’):354.MA translated it in POR as fita de fuder ‘video tape of fucking’.
355.MA translated this in POR as fita de se matar o outro ‘video tape of killing one an-
    other’.

          woman cut-GER-NOM see-1S-DEC
          ‘I saw that tree that was felled by the woman’Finally, the result of nominalisation by -tsy-hͿ can be involved in a possessive
construction:(3282)    kanwa-dy-'hͿ         eri'rwa-tsy-hͿ
          canoe-POS-NOM disc-GER-NOM
          ‘car wheel’ (lit. ‘the thing being a car’s wheel’)With regard to the latter example, there is doubt about whether the possessor
possesses the derived stem or whether -tsy-hͿ nominalises the entire possessive
construction. The root of the possessum erirwa ‘disk’ could namely be a nomi-
nal stem, although this is not completely certain. This example also points to
another correspondence between -tse and -tsy-: bare nouns can be zero-derived
as verb stems by the application of a mood marker.356 Similarly then, -tsy-hͿ
can be applied to bare nominal stems. Also in the subsequent examples -tsy-hͿ
has an emphatic function:(3283)    e-ka'nİ-tsy-hͿ

          (lit. ‘annatto which has the form of powder’)If gerundial -tsy- is a verbal suffix, then a noun root terminated by -tsy-hͿ has
gone through a change of lexical category twice: zero-verbalisation and nomi-
nalisation.
    Sometimes, the gerundial morpheme -tsy- makes the impression of being an
equivalent of the attributive morpheme -Ϳ- (see 4.3.2.1.):(3287)    lowİ̘-'xu-Ϳ-hͿ                         tso'ro   e-'he-tsy-hͿ

          ‘the close one’                        ‘the closer one’However, the contrasted examples represent completely different constructions.
The most important formal difference between the two is that -Ϳ-, being only
optionally nominalised, can be followed immediately by a mood marker, ex-
cept by declarative -tse, while -tsy- is obligatorily nominalised before it can be
verbalised again by a declarative mood marker. Compare kãu-tse ‘it broke’ to
the following examples:(3289)    kãu-tsy-'hͿ                            kãu-tsy-'hͿ-ki

8.1.2.1. Gerundial -tsy- in the interrogativeOnly in the interrogative mood gerundial -tsy- is not nominalised. The present
subsection is partially based on (5.2.2.2.). As we have seen there, the inter-
rogative marker is attached to the zero-marked verb root in third person exam-
ples like the following (repeated from 1331):357.Traditionally, the Kwaza used the red paste from the seeds of annatto (Bixa orellana
    L.) for body decoration.

          who cut-INT
          ‘who is cutting (felling the tree)?’The element -tsy- may be inserted between subject cross-reference marking
(which is zero for the third person) and interrogative -re. No solid explanations
have been found with regard to its presence or absence. If there is a possibility
that gerundial -tsy- is related to declarative -tse, then -tsy- may have a similar
gerundial function in the interrogative:(3291)    'bwa-tse              ‘it is finished’
          'bwa-tsy-hͿ           ‘the/a finished one/finishing one’

          who coffee-CL:liquid drink=end-GER-INT
          ‘who drank all the coffee?’It may be worthwhile to observe how -tsy- is usually inserted between -re and
the negative marker:(3293)    atsile-'re                             atsile-'he-tsy-re
          heavy-INT                              heavy-NEG-GER-INT

          coati     flee-NEG-GER-INT
          ‘the coati has not escaped?’In a similar fashion, -tse usually replaces -ki after the negative marker -he- (and
after the future markers -nã- and -damͿ-). Although I see no compelling reason
to relate the potential modality marker -tsy- to declarative -tse and gerundial
-tsy-, it does have a similar distribution in certain interrogative constructions.
Compare the following examples (repeated from 1354) to (3290):(3295)    di'lİ 'cu-tsy-re                       di'lİ 'cu-tsy-re

          ‘who cut (the tree)?’                  ‘who is going to cut (the tree)?’The example in which -tsy- is analysed as gerundial has a past tense reading
when contrasted to present tense (3290) and to the potential construction which
has a future tense interpretation. It is unclear whether -tsy- is an allomorph of
declarative -tse in the third person interrogative or whether it is a different
morpheme. An important reason to distinguish potential -tsy- from the other
-tsy- (and from -tse) is that the potential -tsy- can be attached directly to overt

future:(3296)    o'ja-xa-tsy-re
          leave-2-POT-INT
          ‘you’re going?’    The semantic difference between interrogatives with and without gerundial
-tsy- is not predictable. Above in (3295) we saw a past interpretation of the
verb containing the -tsy- interrogative, but interrogatives without -tsy- may also
have a past tense reading:(3297)    dilİ-'wã 'mİ̘-re                    (3298)    txa'rwa oja-'re
          who-AO beat-INT                               first     leave-INT
          ‘he hit whom?’                                ‘he went today?’(3299)    o'ja-tsy-re
          leave-GER-INT
          ‘did he go?’Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that there is idiosyncratic and therefore
lexicalised difference between certain verbs with and without -tsy- in the inter-
rogative. However, the next examples do not seem to have any sharply con-
trasting meanings:(3300)    di'lİ               ‘who?’
          di'lİ-re            ‘who is there? (at the door)’
          di'le-tsy-re        ‘who is it?’(3301)    ja        hã'rã-(tsy)-re
          already stop-GER-INT
          ‘already stopped?’Unfortunately, the collected documentation does not provide for clearer exam-
ples and contrasts. Probably the function of gerundial -tsy- is to give an extra
cleft-like effect, like ‘who could it be who ...?’ or ‘what could it be that ...?’.
Note that in case of verb stem ellipsis, -re is usually preceded by -tsy-. In fact,
tsyre is often used as a free minimal response particle, with a potential conno-
tation of doubt: ‘is it?’, ‘would it be?’, ‘I don’t know’.","[646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657]"

4.3.1. PossessiveOne important form of nominal modification is possessive modification.
Kwaza has no possessive pronouns. The possessor- the modifier in the Kwaza
possessive construction- is a personal pronoun or a noun. These constructions
require a derivational possessive morpheme -dy-, which must be applied to the
possessor and which must be followed by a classifier, usually the nominaliser
-hͿ, which functions as a semantically neutral classifier. Some examples are:(657) 'si-dy-hͿ ecǊi'ri            (658) 'si-dy-hͿ   'kopu ko-'ro-tse

      Luzeu-POS-NOM sun steal-DET-1S-DEC
      ‘I stole Luzeu’s lantern / from Luzeu’As seen in example (661), the dependent noun may be verbalised: 'sidyhͿki ‘it
is mine’. In the proper discourse context the head noun may be omitted: 'sidyhͿ
‘mine’. Note the following example:(666) na-'ay-hͿ-dy-hͿ               i'si-ki
      PROX-that-NOM-POS-NOM         die-DEC
      ‘that person’s (son) has died’Case marking in the following example shows that the possessive construction
functions as a single noun phrase in the sentence:(667) 'si-dy-hͿ   etay-'wã     duky'ri-da-ki
      I-POS-NOM woman-AO long-1S-DEC
      ‘I’m longing for my wife’   Instead of the nominaliser -hͿ in the function of a neutral classifier, other,
semantically specific classifiers may be encountered in possessive construc-
tions as well. They were amply discussed in the previous section on classifiers,
so I will limit the evidence here to only few examples:(668) 'si-dy-ro      'dai-xa-ki           (669) 'si-dy-mãi
      I-POS-CL:cup grab-2-DEC                   I-POS-CL:tooth
      ‘you took my cup’                         ‘my teeth’   The combination of these possibilities, the omission of the head noun and
the use of a classifier, allows for two alternative possessive expressions, which
are equivalent in meaning and context-(in)dependence:
113.Order 21 is also possible.

      who-POS-NOM house                        /   who-POS-CL:house (house)
      ‘whose house?’In both examples, the first alternative is an analytic expression involving the
neutral classifier (see 4.2.) and the second alternative is a synthetic headless
construction involving a specific classifier. Here is an example of the latter in a
sentential context:(672) di'lİ-dy-xy          wai-dy-'hͿ-xa-re
      who-POS-CL:house good-CAU-NOM-2-INT
      ‘whose house are you repairing?’   The possessive morpheme -dy- is homophonous with the benefactive mor-
pheme -dy-, but it has a different distribution and behaviour. It forms a root that
neither exists independently as a nominal stem, nor can it form a verb stem like
the benefactive does:(673) 'si-dy-hͿ        /      *si-dy    /   *(kopu) si-dy-ki
      I-POS-NOM        /      I-POS     /   (cup) I-POS-DEC
      ‘mine’We have seen in examples (661) and (662) that concomitants of the possessive
construction can be verbalised through e.g. the declarative marker -ki:(674) 'si-dy-hͿ kanwa=ekai-'e           (675) si-dy-'hͿ-ki         kanwa=ekai-'e
      I-POS-NOM canoe=leg-too                 I-POS-NOM-DEC canoe=leg-too
      ‘my car’                                ‘it is my car/the car is mine’During elicitation sessions in fieldwork doubt was expressed by MA at the
grammaticality of the non-verbalised possessor as an answer two an open
question, like to: ‘whose car is that?’, A: *?'marjudyhͿ ‘Mario’s’ instead of
marjudy'hͿki ‘it is Mario’s’.
   Other verbal moods than the declarative are also possible. Note that in some
of the following interrogative examples, word order is reversed apparently
without semantic consequences:(676) e'tay 'xyi-dy-hͿ-re                   (677) 'xyi-dy-hͿ-re e'tay

      ‘whose is it?’                                ‘whose house is it?’Note that not with all pronouns the possessive morpheme -dy- is possible, that
is, not with the pronoun txana ‘we.IN’:(683) txana(*-dy)-'hͿ-ki          'kopo       (684) 'kopo txana-'ro-ki

      go-EXP we.IN-CD:area
      ‘let’s go to our place!’An explanation for the behaviour of txana is that it is of Tupi-Guarani origin,
unlike the other pronouns. All other pronouns require -dy-, although TE re-
jected also the combination of the possessive morpheme with xyitsİ ‘you.PL’:115(686) tsyitsİ(*-dy)-'hͿ-ki 'kopo
      you.PL(-POS)-NOM-DEC cup
      ‘it is your cup’   In headless possessive constructions which contain a classifier and which
refer to animal body parts, the possessive morpheme -dy- is often, but not al-
ways, optional. The resulting construction is one of noun classification as de-
scribed in (4.2.1.9.):114.Once I ventured *kopo txana-dy-ro-ki ‘our cup’ wherupon MA said in Portuguese:
    'ta certo, mas não existe ‘It’s correct, but it doesn’t exist’.
115.This is probably caused by uncertainty on the part of TE. Notice in this respect that
    TE also pronounced the second person plural pronoun differently from normal xy-
    i'tsİ: [tsÓitsİ] probably in analogy with tsitsİ ‘we.EX’.

volve body parts of humans.
   Possessive constructions can be embedded in other possessive construc-
tions. The embedding possessor possesses the embedded possessor:(693) 'xyi-dy-'hͿ    'mã-dy-'hͿ  a'xy
      you-POS-NOM mother-POS-NOM house
      ‘your mother’s house’As was demonstrated earlier, it is possible to express an object of possession
synthetically through a specific classifier. The resulting headless construction
can be an object of possession itself, but again, only the embedded possessor is
possessed:(694) 'xyi-dy-hͿ     'mã-dy-'rjͿ
      you-POS-NOM mother-POS-CD:area
      ‘your mother’s place’   There are neither possessive pronouns nor possessive inflexion in Kwaza.
There is only one denominal-nominal morpheme, -tjate, which marks a noun as
possessed by a third person possessor:(695) 'kopu-tjate ko-'ro-tsİ
      cup-3.POS without-CL:cup-DEC
      ‘his cup is empty’
186   4. The noun phraseThis morpheme will be discussed under other nominal morphological catego-
ries in section (4.4.1.).
    The possessive morpheme also occurs in combination with the factive
nominaliser -nãi. The result is not a grammatically possessive construction, but
an adverbial complement with the meaning ‘the language of’:(696) aika'nã-dy-nãi     areta-'he-da-ki
      Aikanã-POS-NOM know-NEG-1S-DEC
      ‘I don’t understand Aikanã’The fact that the morpheme -dy- is preferably omitted in the context of the in-
clusive pronoun suggests that it is originally a possessive morpheme:(697) txana(*?-dy)-'nãi
      we.IN-POS-NOM
      ‘our language’The phenomenon of omission of possessive -dy- was also encountered in the
examples (683) to (684) above. Another indication that -dy- is originally a pos-
sessive morpheme comes from the next example:(698) ti-'nãi-hͿ        de'da-dy-nãi           Ǌce'nãi-xa-re
      what-NOM-NOM anaconda-POS-NOM know-2S-INT
      ‘do you know that story about the snake?’ (t)Here, -nãi probably marks a complement clause. The -dy-nãi construction is
treated further in (6.2.4.2.). The morpheme -nãi is discussed exhaustively in
(5.6.2.) and (8.4.2.).
    Apart from the constructions involving -dy- and -tjate, there are no other
grammatical ways to express possession in Kwaza. Lexical alternatives involve
the verb e- ‘have’, as in:(699) xyi'ni 'e-ki                        (700) e-wa-hͿ-ki
      thorn have-DEC                            have-IS-NOM-DEC
      ‘it has thorns’                           ‘it is someone’s’Furthermore, there is a way of speaking in which a possessor can be “under-
stood”, and by that, the whole notion of possession:(701) exyi'co he'we-da-ki esiki-'na

                                                 4.3. Attributive modification   1874.3.2. Attributive (adjective)Attributive constructions in Kwaza are structurally identical to other noun
modification constructions like the possessive. A noun or nominalised verb
with an attributive sense can be juxtaposed to the (optional) head noun which it
modifies. Also verbs with non-attributive meaning can be nominalised and ob-
tain an attributive sense through juxtaposition. It depends on the specific verbal
root or stem which type of nominalisation is involved. In a number of situations
the insertion of a special attributive morpheme -Ϳ- is required. In this section, I
will discuss all non-possessive noun-noun attributive constructions.
    The simplest attributive construction consists of juxtaposed bare nouns:(702) ywy'nwͿ duma'ru             (703) koreja'ri amǊ'tay
      tree     ladle                    plate     glass

      ‘male duck’                         ‘shaman João is treating (someone)’Many nouns contain verb stems, nominalisers and classifiers, either lexicalised
as in (706) and (707), or not:(706) wade-'xyi      bu-ni'te       (707) auxwa'na 'ke-ni'te

      ‘a big cockroach’                          ‘big star’Attributive constructions may consist of multiple juxtaposed nouns:(711) tã'jã wade-'xyi         bu-ni'te    wai-'hͿ-hͿ           'e-ki
      chief tucuma-CL:hair put-INSTR good-NOM-NOM have-DEC
      ‘the chief has a beautiful hat made of the fibre of tucuma’The maximum seems to lie around four juxtaposed nouns. In the following ex-
ample, there was no room for wai'hͿhͿ ‘beautiful’ any more:

      ‘I met the chief wearing a hat made of fibre of tucuma’   There is no difference in Kwaza between nominalisation and relative clause
formation. Nominalised verbs can be finite and juxtaposed to a noun, which
may be the underlying object of the verb stem:(713) a'ru-xy-nite          awͿi-'ja-da-day-hͿ
      cross-CL:leaf-INSTR see-IO-1S-1S-NOM

      ‘there is an animal which bites (CX: inside the box)’Like any other noun modification construction a “relative clause” can be head-
less:(717) 'kui-da-hͿ         txu'hǊi-tse
      drink-1S-NOM small-DEC
      ‘I drank little’ (that which I drank was little)A “relative clause” can be verbalised again which results in a cleft-like con-
struction:(718) jo-ka'nİ     txitxi-'dy-da-hͿ-ki
      manioc-bar fry-CAU-1S-NOM-DEC

      ‘that would be nice’The nominaliser -hͿ is dealt with more extensively in (5.6.). It has remained
unclear so far whether there are other connotations involved in the application

clauses” are further discussed as attributive clauses in (8.4.1.).
    In the following example, a verb stem without inflexion is treated as a noun.
Note that this nominal interpretation is limited to this very construction, which
represents a nickname (AN’s nickname of Capitão Pedro):(720) 'tãjã to'koi
      chief soft
      ‘Captain Softy’Other nominalising morphemes like -te and -nite may also contribute to at-
tributive constructions. They will all be treated in (5.6.).","[219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227]"

5.4.1. Number of argumentsMost Kwaza verb roots bear no morphological indicators of their basic seman-
tic valency. Transitive verbs do not differ systematically in form from intransi219.lit. ‘I make it be in the hole’
356   5. The verb phrasetive verbs. Furthermore, most verbs are not subcategorised for a specific num-
ber of arguments. Consequently, transitive verbs can often be used intransi-
tively, without morphological marking.
    Kwaza has semantically intransitive verbs. They are subcategorised for only
one argument. Examples are listed below:(1706)   atsi'le-     ‘to be heavy’          ku'ry-    ‘to row’
         bay-         ‘to be sour’           o'ri-     ‘to climb’
         e'mã-        ‘to weep’              tãi-      ‘to be hard, to be tough’
         emǊ'hͿ-      ‘to be wet’            tsǊ-      ‘to swim’Some intransitive verbs can be regarded as impersonal because they never take
an independent subject or object:(1707)   a'we-        ‘to rain’
         bİ'rİ-       ‘exploding of thunder with lightning’
         kara'ja-     ‘to be the dry season’
         kyry'ja-     ‘rumbling of thunder with rain’
         ty'je-       ‘to stop raining’
         tsi?a'rjͿ-   ‘to be silent’
         wİ'ro-       ‘flashing of lightning’Kwaza also has semantically transitive verbs, which are subcategorised for two
arguments: subject and object. Some of them are listed below:(1708)   dai-         ‘to take, to grab something’
         di-          ‘to break something’
         ha'do-       ‘to pierce something’
         hã'tsǊ-      ‘to skin an animal’
         mİ̘-         ‘to beat someone’
         ro'roi-      ‘to mash something’
         tsİ̘i-       ‘to tear something’
         tsu'ku-      ‘to chew, to hold something inside the mouth’
         wa'txi-      ‘to collect, to pick up something’A few verbs were attested which appear to be potentially ditransitive:(1709)   hai-         ‘to water, to give liquid to someone, to drench’
         wa'dy-       ‘to give something to someone’
                                                  5.4. Valency and valency change   357The following example illustrates the verb hai- ‘to drench’:(1710)     mƭu-(*ko) marju-'wã 'hai-da-ki
           chicha-INS Mario-AO drench-1S-DEC
           ‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’220The fact that mƭu ‘chicha’ cannot receive instrumental case marking indicates
probably that it is the direct object here. Compare this to the following exam-
ple:(1711)     keimǊ-(ko) marijaDite-'wã        haje-'kai-da-ki
           oil-INS       Maria.Edite-AO smear-CL:leg-1S-DEC
           ‘I put oil on Maria Edite’s leg’In this example instrumental marking is optional. At one stage the consultant
explained about such arguments that “they are more correct with -ko but if you
are lazy or you don’t feel like talking, you leave it out”. Therefore, I have not
considered the omission of (optional) local case marking of one of the argu-
ments as very strong proof for formal (di-)transitivity (see the related discus-
sion in 4.1.3.).
    The verbs listed above do not require any special morphological marking in
order to be used with the number of arguments for which they are subcatego-
rised. Furthermore, the valency of many transitive verbs can be decreased
without any further morphological adaptation. Verbs such as ãwͿi- ‘to see’,
hyri- ‘to steal’, kui- ‘to drink’, wady- ‘to give’, etc. can be used both transi-
tively or intransitively.

8.3.1.3. Second person marking in interrogative cosubordinationThe present subsection concerns variation between overt and zero-marking of
second person in clauses which are cosubordinated to an interrogative matrix
predicate. In (8.3.1.2.) above, variation between overt and zero-marking of sec-
ond person in medial clauses was explained in relation to zero-marking of the
second person in the imperative matrix predicate. Such an explanation is not
possible in the case of interrogative matrix clauses. Here, the variation appears
to be optional. In the next example, second person is expressed overtly across
the entire clause chain, as expected:(3487)   Ǌcenãi-'nã-xa-ta ere'we-xy-xa-ki
         know-FUT-2-CSO write-CL:leaf-2-DEC
         ‘you are writing in order to learn’However, it is absent in the next examples:(3488)   tsǊhǊ-'du-ta   hyhyrwa-'nã-xa-re
         what-BER-CSO move-FUT-2-INT
         ‘why are you going for a walk?’(3489)   tsǊhǊ-'du-ta   kunͿ-'djo-xa-re        coha-si'ki
         what-BER-CSO dress-CL:foot-2-INT foot-CL:skin
         ‘why (for what purpose) are you putting on shoes?’(3490)   tsǊhǊ-'du-ta   kunͿ-'djo-xa-xa-re        coha-si'ki
         what-BER-CSO dress-CL:foot-2-AS-INT foot-CL:skin
         ‘why (for what purpose) are you (PL) putting on shoes?’One could explain away these examples by interpreting the medial clause as a
cleft construction ‘why is it that...?’, but this explanation runs into problems
when one considers examples involving other persons, like (3479) and (3480)
and the following:
660    8. Subordination and coordination(3491)    tsǊhǊ-'du-da-ta     ha'do-da-re
          why-BER-1S-CSO pierce-1S-INT
          ‘why did I pierce it?’Furthermore, second person marking appears to be optional in other construc-
tions, even though co-referent first person marking in a similar position would
be obligatory:(3492)    ã'wͿi-(xa)-ta 'nãi-xa-re
          see-2-CSO       like-2-DEC
          ‘did you watch first before you try?’(3493)    ã'wͿi-da-ta 'nãi-da-ki
          see-1S-CSO like-1S-DEC
          ‘I watched / learnt first before I do that’The only explanation of a more general validity for the absence or optionality
of second person marking in medial clauses would be that it could hardly lead
to ambiguity. Persons other than the second are usually clearly indicated, even
the third person, albeit fused in a special cosubordinative marker -tja, cf.
(3489):(3494)    tsǊhǊ-'du-tja kunͿ-'djo-re          coha-si'ki
          what-BER-CSO dress-CL:foot-INT foot-CL:skin
          ‘why (for what purpose) is he putting on shoes?’
8.3.1.4. Third person marking in medial clauses: -tja and -taIn matrix clauses, a third person subject gets zero cross-reference. In cosubor-
dinated constructions with identical third person, a separate third person marker
is not identifiable in the medial clause. However the medial clause “mood”
marker is often -tja instead of the expected -ta as with all other persons. So one
might consider -tja as the result of fusion of third person subject and cosubor-
dinative “mood”, but it is unclear which elements have fused. The morpheme is
pronounced usually as [tja], but the pronunciation [ta] is also encountered.377
The following examples illustrate its use in different moods:(3495)    Ǌcenãi-'he-tja      kuraku'ra hu'hui-ki
          know-NEG-CSO        chicken      kill-DEC
          ‘by mistake he killed (not a pig but) a chicken’
377.Maybe this form is based on historical assimilation and metathesis of the indefinite
    object marker -ja- and the initial consonant of the cosubordinative marker -ta.
                                        8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses   661(3496)   zjwãu 'peDro hãrã-he'ta-tja tutunita'hͿ-ki
         João Pedro     stop-DESI-CSO think-DEC
         ‘João wants Pedro to stop (e.g. working)’(3497)   tsuhǊ-'nã-tja kunͿ-'djo-re     coha-si'ki
         what-FUT-CSO dress-CL:foot-INT foot-CL:skin
         ‘why is he putting on shoes?’The exact semantics of the medial clause is not perfectly clear. In some exam-
ples it was translated by the consultant as a clefted sentence, in which analysis
its subject would obviously not be identical to the matrix clause subject:(3498)   Ǌce'nãi-tja ere'we-xy-ki
         know-CSO write-CL:leaf-DEC
         ‘(he discovered it is) for learning that he is writing’(3499)   Ǌcenãi-'nã-tja      ere'we-xy-ki
         know-FUT-CSO        write-CL:leaf-DEC
         ‘he writes in order to learn’However, such clefted translations were sometimes also given for medial verbs
which were overtly marked for person, such as in (3483).
    Although the fused morpheme -tja is often encountered as the third person
cosubordinative marker, transparent, i.e. zero-marking is also attested. In this
construction the canonical cosubordinative marker -ta is used and the third per-
son subject gets canonical zero expression. No semantic or pragmatic distinc-
tions whatsoever were encountered between these alternative expressions, and
all consultants always said “it means the same”. The following examples were
considered as totally equivalent:(3500)   'kwİ-ta      atxitxi-'nǊ        'ja-ki
         enter-CSO maize-CL:powder eat-DEC
         ‘he entered and ate maize porridge’(3501)   'kwİ-tja     atxitxi-'nǊ        'ja-ki
         enter-CSO maize-CL:powder eat-DEC
         ‘he entered and ate maize porridge’The only systematic difference between the two alternatives seems to lie in
their relative frequency of occurrence: third person -Ø-ta is rarer than -tja. The
following examples do not reveal any specific systematic differences with
those containing -tja which we saw earlier on:
662    8. Subordination and coordination(3502)     wywy'rjͿ-ki        awy-'ja-ta
           wind.blow-DEC      cold-IO-CSO

           ‘(the jaguar) grabbed and took away (the chicken)’(3504)     'heme   'mã-ta-ki       pİ̘rİ̘jã-tja-'nã-ta-ta
           Hermes call-1O-DEC      speak-TRA-FUT-1O-CSO
           ‘Hermes called me over in order to speak with me’Both forms can even cooccur inside the same clause chain. The contrast be-
tween the next two examples suggests that -Ø-ta and -tja cross-refer to the
same subject in (3505):378(3505)     zjwãu kreBa-'nã 'cu-tjacucu-'ta                Bahoso-'nã         hã'rã-tse

           ‘I walked from Gleba to Barroso’The semantic difference between the next two examples is due more to other
factors than to the different cosubordinative markers:(3507)     o'nİ-ta      'a-hͿ-ki    (3508)             onİ=o'nİ-tja      a-'ki

           ‘he came and is there                       ‘he always came’
           (now at that place)’The habitual aspect in example (3508) is possibly caused by reduplication of
the verb root (see 5.5.27.).
   No convincing morphophonological circumstances were observed to require
one or the other expression of the third person cosubordinative. The only for-
mal condition which was encountered seems to consist in either formal resem-
blance (analogy) or etymological relationship of a preceding syllable to a per-
son cross-reference marker. After the verb root tsicwa- ‘begin’, the cosubordi-
native morpheme -tja is not possible. This is probably because the element
-cwa- is associated with indefinite subject -cwa-, which is discussed in
(8.3.1.5.). Nevertheless In the following example, the element -cwa- is an inde-
feasible part of the verb root:378.Combinations like *-da-tja for first person cosubordinative are rejected categorically.
                                           8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses     663(3509)    tsicwa-'ta cu'cu-ki
          begin-CSO step-DEC
          ‘he began to walk’So, from the viewpoint of morphological segmentability the element -cwa- is
treated as if it is a productive cross-reference marker. Because it is not, the ex-
clusivity of -ta in a third person medial construction may be considered as a
morphophonological constraint with a highly limited domain.
    We shall now return to the reason why -Ø-ta is less frequent than -tja to ex-
press third person subject in cosubordination. Probably, -Ø-ta can lead to am-
biguity with a zero-marked second person. There is no such danger in the im-
perative because its subject is intrinsically a second person, while its medial
clauses usually even employ the overt cross-reference marker -xa-. But as ex-
plained in (8.3.1.3.), zero-marking of a second person does also occur in medial
clauses cosubordinated with interrogative matrix predicates. As long as a ma-
trix predicate form is present, there is little doubt about the interpretation of the
zero-marked persons in medial clauses. However, when a matrix verb is absent
or at the end of an extended clause chain, there may be room for confusion.
Therefore -Ø-ta may be less frequently used for third person than -tja.
    Another hypothesis about the nature of -tja is that it is (originally?) not a co-
subordinative marker, but a manner-adverbial clause ending. This hypothesis is
discussed in section (8.2.4.).","[697, 698, 699, 700, 701]"

5.1.   Person cross-referenceIn the present subsection, all regularities and idiosyncrasies concerning person
cross-reference in the declarative mood are discussed. In general, the same
properties apply to person cross-reference in other moods, but there are some
minor differences. Those singularities of person cross-reference which are de-
pendent on specific moods will be treated as they present themselves in the
section on mood (5.2.). Reduplication of cross-reference markers has temporal
and aspectual effects and interacts with certain specific morphological catego-
ries. This will all be discussed in several subsections of (5.5.) and in (7.3.).
Omission of cross-reference markers will be discussed in the section on ellipsis
of inflexion in (7.5.1.). Independent use of cross-reference markers as if they
were separate lexemes will be discussed in (7.5.2.). Reported speech, adverbi-
alisation, existential and certain types of verbalisation of nouns, are realised
through cliticisation of cross-reference and mood markers. This will be re-
sumed in (7.5.2.3.). Other categories such as reflexive and reciprocal are
probably not “inflexional” as they have just one invariable form across all per-
sons and moods. They will be treated as derivation in section (5.4.6.) and
(5.4.7.) respectively.
    As mentioned in the introduction of (5.), verbs are obligatorily marked for
person. Subject person marking is obligatory, whereas object person marking
has an optional character. Subject person marking can be anaphoric, and the
overt pronominal expression of the subject, or for that matter the object, has an
emphatic or disambiguating function, as in:(1031)    txa'na cu'cu-a-re
          we.IN step-1P-INT
          ‘is it we who are walking (on the photo)?’(1032)    xyi oja-'nã-xa-ki
          you go-FUT-2-DEC
          ‘it is you who is going (and not him)’When no such emphasis or disambiguation is required, the obligatory cross-
reference morpheme suffices, and a coreferent pronoun is not used:
                                                   5.1. Person cross-reference     245(1033)    lo'na 'je-da-ki
          hole dig-1S-DEC
          ‘I dug a hole’    The basic principle that underlies subject marking is the same as the one
which underlies the personal pronoun system. There is no clear singular and
plural distinction in the subject cross-reference system. Instead, there is asso-
ciation between first, second and third persons. One of the consequences of this
is the distinction between first person inclusive and exclusive both in the pro-
noun system and in subject cross-reference marking. There are apparently no
etymological relations between the pronominal (pro) and subject cross-
referential (scr) forms:Table 21. Personal pronouns and person cross-reference markers

nouns and cross-reference marking have in common were discussed and illus-
trated.
    Bare personal pronouns usually correspond with subject cross-reference
marking. There are no special object pronouns. However, like various exam-
ples in section (4.1.1.) illustrate, personal pronouns may fulfil object function
when marked for (animate) object case. They correspond to a different set of
cross-reference morphemes on the verb. Note the following example:(1034)    xyi-'wã wa'dy-hata-ki
          you-AO give-3S.2O-DEC
          ‘he gave (it) to you’   Object cross-reference marking precedes subject cross-reference marking,
and an overt pronoun in the object function is not obligatory:(1035)    tsi'tsİ   wady-ni'nã-a-xa-ki
          we.EX give-2O-1P-AS-DEC
          subject verb-object-subject-mood
          ‘we gave to you’ (one person in the name of all)   As shown in table (21) above the cross-reference of third person subject is
un- or zero-marked.
246    5. The verb phrase(1036)    wã'wͿ-Ø-ki
          sleep-3-DEC
          ‘he is/they are sleeping’In the same vein, third person object of transitive verbs is morphologically un-
marked, whereas other object persons are marked on the verb.152 It may not be
justified to claim that the third person subject is always unmarked morphologi-
cally, as object marking is realised by portmanteau morphemes which also
specify a possible range of subjects. In example (1035) the object marker im-
plies any first person subject, either “singular”, inclusive or exclusive, while
the actual subject is further specified by the first person exclusive subject
marker. The object marker as in (1034) can only be combined with a third per-
son subject. Like in the following example, number of person is not distin-
guished:(1037)    zjwãu 'mİ̘-hata-Ø-ki      xyitsİ-'wã
          João beat-3S.2O-3-DEC you.PL-AO
          subject verb-object-subject-mood object-case
          ‘It was João who beat you’Nevertheless, no part of the marker -hata- ‘(third person subject second person
object)’ can be identified as ‘third person subject’ and the other object markers
which go with a third person subject hardly even bear so much as partial re-
semblance to the form -hata-.
   The next example shows that a third person object of a transitive verb re-
mains unmarked:(1038)    tsi'tsİ   'mİ̘-Ø-a-xa-ki
          we.EX beat-3-1P-AS-DEC
          subject verb-object-subject-mood
          ‘we’re hitting (him)’This example also implies that person marking of transitive verbs with third
person objects cannot be distinguished from person marking of intransitive or
objectless transitive verbs. The following utterance is both formally and se-
mantically ambiguous in this respect:(1039)    'ja-(Ø-)Ø-ki
          eat-(3-)3-DEC
          ‘he is eating/he ate (it)’152.In the present work I chose not to represent “third person” by a zero-morpheme -Ø-,
    but I let this be the default reading of the unmarked verb.
                                                        5.1. Person cross-reference     247In Kwaza, semantically (di)transitive verbs often have an intransitive reading
as well: ƭ wa'dyki lit. ‘it is he who gave’ either has a transitive sense ‘it is he
who gave it to him’ or intransitive ‘it is he who is giving (i.e. he does not want
anything in return)’.
   Although inclusive and exclusive objects can be expressed by case-marked
pronouns, there is no distinction between inclusive and exclusive object cross-
reference:(1040)     ƭ wa'dy-e'teja-ki tjana-'wã          /   sitsİ-'wã
           he give-1PO-DEC we.IN-AO             /   we.EX-AO
           ‘he gave us (IN/EX) a present’    So far, only reference to definite arguments has been dealt with. Aside from
this type of reference, another type was attested which marks reference to in-
definite arguments. The morpheme -wa- refers to an indefinite subject (IS), as
in (1041) and the morpheme -ja- refers to an indefinite object (IO), as in (1042):(1041)     xy'xy-wa-ki                          (1042)      kahe-'ja-ki
           scream-IS-DEC                                    bite-IO-DEC
           ‘someone screamed’                               ‘it bites people’Indefinite subject reference can be combined with all objects. Likewise indefi-
nite object reference can be combined with all subjects. The category of indefi-
nite argument cross-reference will be treated in (5.1.4.).
    Besides indefinite cross-reference, there is also impersonal subject reference
which involves the impersonal subject morpheme -na-. This will be discussed
in (5.1.5.). Furthermore, there is future second person object reference which
involves the morpheme -leja-, which will be discussed in (5.1.8.). Finally,
cross-reference paradigms for moods other than the declarative may differ
(partially) from the one which applies for the declarative mood. This will be
discussed in the relevant subsections of (5.2.) on mood.
    In the following table, the basic constituent elements of subject and object
cross-reference markers are integrated in one figure showing their functional
domains:153
153.PL = plural object, 3S = third person subject, I = indefinite argument, IPL = imper-
    sonal subject, the other abbreviations are standard. Note that this table is not intended
    to show the distribution or (the obligatoriness of) the combinability of the forms. It
    only shows the meaning of each form individually, e.g. -da- is first person subject;
    -ta- is first person object; -ete- occurs only as a plural element in first person plural
    and second person object forms; -nƭnã- is a second person object form; -hata- is a
    second person object that occurs exclusively with third person subjects.

8.3.2.1.2. Functions of different subject clausesAs was demonstrated in (8.3.1.7.) the medial clause may function as a com-
plement of cause or reason. This is also true for medial clauses marked for dif-
ferent third person subject:(3573)    ma'rija ra'tja-dy-ta   'İ-hͿ-ki                 zjwãu
          Maria order-DS-CSO leave-NOM-DEC                João

          ‘(as) it was raining much, he was planting/planted maize’
8.3.2.1.3. Different subject clauses and comparisonThe medial clause marked for different third person subject is also used to ex-
press a comparative sense:(3576)    'kopo      txuhǊƭ-'Ϳ-dy-ta        cͅrͅmǊ-'ro          nͿ-'ro-(hͿ)-ki

          ‘the tin of milk is bigger than the cup’
8.3.2.1.4. Different subject -dy- and causative -dy-The element which indicates different subject is homophonous with the bene-
factive/causative morpheme -dy- (see 5.4.3.). The translation given by the con-
sultant for the next example suggests a benefactive reading of -dy-, although
grammatical analysis probably warrants the conclusion that it represents the
different subject marker:
                                            8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses     677(3577)    wanã'dy txu'hǊi-Ϳ-dy-ta           ja-'he-tse

-dy- may originate from a metaphorical use of the benefactive. It is possible
that the two categories of benefactive/causative and different subject are related
in some way. About the following example, it cannot be denied that the logical
subject of the verb root are- ‘transform’ is different from that of oja- ‘leave’:(3578)    ã'rǊi are-dy-da-'ta       o'ja-da-ki
          tapir turn-CAU-1S-CSO leave-1S-DEC
          ‘I made him turn into a tapir and I went away’Because of the fact that the formal subjects of the concomitant clauses in this
example are identical, non-third persons, the element -dy- is to be interpreted as
a causative marker.
   A clear formal difference between both morphemes may be that causative
-dy- tends to attract stress, whereas the different subject morpheme does not.389
My teacher MA pointed out to me the possibility of the following minimal pair:(3579)    cu-'dy-ta                               'cu-dy-ta
          cut-CAU-CSO                             cut-DS-CSO
          ‘he ordered him to cut’                 ‘he cut, and then...’He considered the similarity between these phrases as striking but said that they
were totally different in nature.
   The following example contains a verb in which both the causative mor-
pheme and the different subject marker cooccur:(3580)    diri-'dy-dy-ta           a'wͿi-ta
          descend-CAU-DS-CSO       see-CSO
          ‘she(i) made him descend and she(j) saw him’ (t)Maybe one could say that causative -dy- causes a switch of subjects within the
verb stem, and different subject -dy- causes a switch of subjects across a com-
plex clause construction.
388.‘ficou pouquinho para ele, não comeu’
389.Since it does not even receive secondary stress, the different subject marker is often
    almost inaudible in narrative texts and its presence can be reconstructed from a
    pause.
678   8. Subordination and coordination8.3.2.1.5. Discourse particles and discontinuityIn (8.3.1.9.) it was shown how cosubordinative markers are sometimes used as
particles. The same seems to be possible with different third person subjects:(3581)   zjwãu     'a-tja       'marju       'a-tja      hͿ-dy-ta
         João      exist-CSO    Mario        exist-CSO   NOM-DS-CSO         tsiri'tsa 'a-ki       'peDro

         ‘Pedro lives between João and Mario’(3582)   'ƭwã    'nãi-xa-ki mãrİ̘ri'tsa         ja'he-xa-ki=tja     'ta-dy-ta

   what-NOM hide-1S-INT         NEG-1S-DEC=CSO talk-DS-CSO            DS-CSO   'ƭwã       'nãi-xa-ki mãrİ̘dy-'ra ca'ri-da-ta 'jo-da-mͿ
   nothing like-2-DEC expose-IMP kill-1S-CSO devour-1S-VOL
   ‘“that isn’t you, no way, you have hidden someone” she said to her, “whom
   did I hide?, I didn’t” she said, well, “you’re lying, get him out of there!, I
   will kill him and devour him”’ (t)The examples show how the combined different subject and cosubordinative
markers behave as if they were a free morpheme. In the proper context, the
element (hͿ)dyta is interpreted as a discourse particle with the approximated
senses of ‘well, while, as, when, then’. Grammatically, it remains an instrument
to express switch reference, but it has also a connotation of counter-
expectation, surprise or suspicion:(3583)   dy-'ta     zjwãu    okja-'nã-tja   o'ja-tse
         DS-CSO     João     hunt-FUT-CSO leave-DEC
         ‘then (strangely), João went hunting’(3584)   S: sa'mweu      'onİ-ki      zjwãu-dy'nͿ
            Samuel       arrive-DEC João-COMIT
            ‘Samuel is arriving, and João too’         H: zjwãu-'e                      S: zjwãu-dy-'ta
            João-too                         João-DS-CSO
            ‘João too?’                      ‘(yes, remarkably) João too’Hence, it appears that the morpheme combination -dy-ta does not only express
discontinuity of third person subjects across a complex sentence, but it may
                                        8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses   679also communicate an interruption of what would be expected. On somewhat
rarer occasions it was attested how -dy-ta, besides functioning as a switch ref-
erence marker, was associated with termination of the event expressed by the
verb:(3585)    barİ-dy-'mǊ-dy-ta                      (3586)     wara'ñͿ-dy-ta
          heat-CAU-CL:liquid-DS-CSO                         work-DS-CSO
          ‘he finished heating up the water’ (t)            ‘he finished working’So the element -dy- is used to express discontinuity in a more general sense as
well.

mood markers as free resumptive particles, see (7.5.2.2.). For similar phenom-
ena involving the switch-reference mood, see (8.3.2.3.1.).","[714, 715, 716, 717]"

4.6.1. Orientation: ӻ- and ay-Kwaza does not have special demonstrative pronouns. Demonstrative is ex-
pressed by a bound attributive root which requires further derivation by a clas-
sifier. This phenomenon is discussed in among others section (7.6.3.). There
are two demonstrative roots: Ϳ- and ay-, and they belong to the group of at-
tributive roots that require a classifier as listed in (4.3.2.2.). They cannot be
used as independent morphemes: *Ϳ, *ay, nor can they be verbalised like verb
roots or noun stems: *Ϳki, *ayki. First when a classifier is attached they can be
used as adverbs, head nouns or attributive modifiers (see 4.3.2.) or, after ver-
balisation, as predicates:(915) ay-'hͿ       kui-he-'ky

      this-NOM-DEC cup              /     cup this-NOM-DEC
      ‘the cup is here, it is this cup’The semantics of the demonstrative system is based on the contrast between
speaker-orientedness and hearer-orientedness. Ϳ'hͿ means ‘this one here in my
vicinity’, ay'hͿ means ‘that one there in your vicinity’. The difference between
proximity and distality is a secondary phenomenon which can be elaborated
further through morphological operations introduced below.
   The following evidence goes to show that Ϳ- means ‘close to speaker’ and
ay- ‘close to hearer’:(921) Q: Ϳ-'hͿ-re              A: ay-'hͿ-ki

      that-NOM give-1SO-IMP
      ‘give me that one there (with you)’137The distinction between the demonstrative roots may be based on physical
contact. When the hearer holds an object in his hands, the speaker may refer to
the object by ay'hͿ. When the speaker himself holds it he must refer to it by
Ϳ'hͿ.138 However, like many examples in this section show, this is not a prereq-
uisite. One of the attestations of ay'hͿ ‘that one’ was as a warning precisely
136.The orders 132 and 213 are also allowed.
137.This example was created by myself as a translation of the Portuguese phrase (mim-
    dá) esse aí (com você), which was given by the consultant as a proper context of use
    of ay'hͿ.
138.When the speaker and the hearer together are holding one and the same object in
    their hands the object is referred to by Ϳ'hͿ.
                                                             4.6. Demonstratives   225against contact: ay'hͿ ‘(be careful of) that (animal which bites, and which is
close to you)!’.
   Some of the examples, like (922), suggest that the demonstrative does not
only refer to an object, but may also be associated with the place where the
object is located:(925) Ϳ-'hͿ-ki                    ay-'hͿ-ki

      ‘it is here’                ‘it is (that one) there’The “locational” demonstrative can be expressed more explicitly by the classi-
fier -rjͿ ‘area’. In that case, the orientation cannot be fully predicted on the ba-
sis of the demonstrative root in the way illustrated above: whereas ay-'rjͿ refers
more or less predictably to ‘the place there’, which may probably either be
close to H or not, Ϳ-'rjͿ indicates a ‘place there’ that is apparently close to nei-
ther S nor H, but remote from both. So Ϳ-'rjͿ does not mean ‘this place’:(926) Ϳ-'rjͿ-ki                   ay-'rjͿ

      ‘to/on the old field there’The following example of relative clause-like attributive juxtaposition suggests
that the demonstrative ending in -rjͿ has nominal properties:(930) ay-'rjͿ       o'ja-tsy-rjͿ
      that-CD:area go-POT-CD:area
      ‘the place to which he would go’Nevertheless, locative demonstratives ending in -rjͿ and -xuko are structurally
adverbs (see 6.2.). This is demonstrated by many examples in the present sec-
tion, e.g. (928), (935), (949) and (972).
226   4. The noun phrase4.6.2. Distance: na- and jã-Two prefixes are often encountered with demonstratives: na- ‘(proximate)’ and
jã- ‘(distal)’. The prefix na- usually indicates that the referent of the demon-
strative expression has been mentioned before in the discourse, or that it is
well-known or emphasised. It is prefixed only to the root ay-. The combination
*na-Ϳ- was always rejected as ungrammatical, probably because the sense of
(metaphorical) proximity it would convey is already present in the speaker-
orientedness of the root Ϳ-.(931) na-ay-'hͿ                   (932) na-ay-'xy

      PROX-that-time come-NOM-DEC
      ‘he arrived at that time (in the discourse, long ago or recently)’In a way, the qualification of na- as a metaphorically used proximate is doubt-
ful, because no non-metaphorical use was attested. It functions in actual fact as
an amplifier of the root ay-.
    The prefix jã- indicates that the referent of the demonstrative expression is
without reach of both the speaker and the hearer, or, when -rjͿ ‘area’ is in-
volved, that it is invisible. Because it is usually attached to the root Ϳ- ‘this’ and
deprives it of its proximate sense, I have dubbed it ‘distal’.

sultants, and a possible explanation is that if something is close to the hearer, it
cannot be out of reach. Alternatively, it could mean that when something is at
an equal distance from both S and H, it cannot be hearer-oriented. In terms of
“markedness”, this would imply that Ϳ- ‘(S-oriented)’ is the unmarked form

4.6.3. Location: -hӻ-ko and -xukoIn order to express the notion ‘place close to S’ another construction is used: Ϳ-
hͿ-'ko ‘here (close to me)’. Canonically, the ending -ko is an instrumental case
marker, and it is also applicable to demonstrative stems:(952) Ϳ-hͿ-'ko         'nãi-da-ki

      cup       DIST-this-CL:cup-INS drink-1S-DEC

      this-NOM-INS-1S-DEC
      ‘I’m here’ (S talking on telephone)139.The Portuguese translation é aquela casa refers to a house equidistant from S and H.
140.The use of an overt lexical object kopo would be superfluous.
                                                               4.6. Demonstratives     229In (4.1.3.1.) it is shown that locative use of -ko has a cislocative connotation
when applied to common nouns: it indicates the place where the speaker is lo-
cated.
    The neutral classifier -hͿ in ͿhͿ'ko ‘here’ can be replaced by a specific clas-
sifier, e.g. by -xy- ‘house’ in Ϳxy'ko ‘in this house’. Although in the following
examples the classifier agrees with a remote subject, it does not rob the result-
ing demonstrative adverbial of its sense of proximity with regard to the location
of the speaker:(959) erewe-xy-nite-'xy                     'ãi-ki  Ϳ-xy-'ko
      write-CL:leaf-INSTR-CL:house          far-DEC this-CL:house-INS
      ‘the school is far from here’(960) erewe-xy-nite-'xy                     Ϳ-xy-'ko          'ãi-hͿ=wara

       Gleba-ATT-INS close-DEC
       ‘the school is far from here but to Gleba it is close’141So although the literal meaning of Ϳxy'ko ‘here’ is ‘the house close to S’, in the
above examples it means ‘as (the remote) house is regarded: a place close to S’
or ‘a place which is in relation to (the remote) house close to S’.
    The consultants confirmed that ͿhͿ'ko is in principle ambiguous: it may
have instrumental meaning ‘using this one’ or cislocative meaning ‘the place
here’. Contradictory information was obtained on the possibilities of ayhͿ'ko.
One consultant, TE, claimed it did not exist. Another consultant, MA, said it
has the same speaker-oriented meanings as ͿhͿ'ko. However, on an earlier oc-
casion MA had claimed that ayhͿ'ko is different: as expected, ayhͿ'ko has a
hearer-oriented instrumental reading ‘using that one’, but, alternatively, it may
have a hearer-oriented locative reading ‘over there’, which goes against the
cislocative analysis. The difference between ayhͿ'ko and ay'rjͿ is not clear, but
there are some indications that ay'rjͿ is less- or unmarked with respect to hearer
orientation.
    There is a morpheme -xuko, which can be attached to attributive roots and
which emphasises immediate proximity within the same settlement. It replaces
either -hͿ-ko or -rjͿ in this morphological position. The morpheme is not ana-
lysable and the element -xu- does not behave in the same way as the neutral
classifier and nominaliser -hͿ: *Ϳxu, *(na)ayxu. Nevertheless, the element -ko
is undoubtedly related to the instrumental case marker in a cislocative function.
Note the following examples:
141.Note that -ko in 'greba-'Ϳ-ko ‘(there) in Gleba’ represents the sole attested occurrence
    of a case marker immediately after the attributive morpheme -Ϳ-.

tion:(974) Ϳ-xu'ko greBa-'ko 'a-da-ki

      ‘I live here in Gleba’The morpheme -xuko appears unanalysable, and behaves in its entirety as if it
were a classifier:(975) 'si-dy-'rjͿ-ki         koreja'ro
      I-POS-CD:area-DEC pan
      ‘the pan is at my place (where we’re not at the moment)’(976) 'si-dy-xu'ko-ki     koreja'ro
      I-POS-SETT-DEC pan
      ‘the pan is here at my place (where I am too at the moment)’-xuko has an allomorph -xukwo-, which occurs in another position in between
person and mood inflexion of the matrix verb:143(977) si-ra'ta a-da-'day-xukwo-ki
      I-first   exist-1S-1S-SETT-DEC

      you-first    exist-2-2S-SETT-DEC
      ‘you are the first inhabitant here’Certain lexical roots also contain the semantic feature of being within the same
indigenous settlement144, e.g. the verb karİ̘'tİ- ‘to pay a visit within the same
settlement’. The use of Ϳxu'ko as in *?Ϳxuko'na karİ̘'tİdaki ‘I went visiting peo-
ple here’, or a locative place name, is then not correct because as MA ex-
plained: ‘you are already here’. The same holds when talking about third per-
sons who live in a different settlement from speaker and hearer:
    H’.
143.However, when explicitly inquiring about the form /-xukwo-/ in these examples, it
    was rejected and corrected to /-xuko-/.
144.I.e. on the same tract of cleared ground in the forest, with a few houses and some
    manioc and maize fields, all of which is usually within a radius of about one kilome-
    tre. The next “settlement” may be three or more kilometres away.

4.6.4. TimeThere are no indications that spatial demonstrative expressions can be used for
temporal deixis. Consequently, a demonstrative like ͿhͿko ‘here’ cannot be
used instead of hary'ky ‘now’ or txa'rwa ‘now, first’, like in English phrases
such as “here I stop eating”. Although attributive demonstratives can neither be
extended metaphoricallly to time, they can morphologically, employing the ad-
verbialising suffix -wy ‘time, moment of’:(980) ay-'wy da'nͿ a-'he-da-'day-hͿ-ki
      that-time still exist-NEG-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
      ‘at that time I was not living here’(981) na-ay-'wy        o'nİ-hͿ-ki
      PROX-that-time arrive-NOM-DEC
      ‘he arrived at that time’ay'wy ‘that time’ may also refer to time in the future.
   One example was encountered of a possible temporal extension of a spatial
demonstrative in the concluding sentence of a traditional tale. In the following
example, ayxuko ‘here in the same village’ could be interpreted as ‘from that
time onwards’:(982) hary'ky ay-xu'ko      co-e=nãi-'e-wa-'ki=cwa-ra'ti-ki
      now      that-SETT many-again=like-again-IS-DEC=be-FOC-DEC
      ‘now here, they multiplied again in this way, it is said’ (t)When I asked my consultant about the function of the demonstrative here, he
said that “here” signified ‘end of the story’.
   The adverbialising suffix -wy is discussed in (6.2.4.1.).","[261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270]"

5.6.5. Collective noun -nahereThe morpheme -nahere produces a collective noun. When applied to personal
names, it refers to the people who are associated with that person in some way:
family, tribe, neighbours etc. When applied to place names it refers to the in-
habitants of the place. When applied to words for animals, it refers to the mem-
bers of the species, order or kingdom. When applied to common nouns it is in a
way a plural marker. In the following examples the nominal application of
-nahere is illustrated:(2501)   tete'ru-nahere                      (2502)   duky-'hͿ-nahere
         Teteru-COL                                   other-NOM-COL
         ‘family of Teteru, those who                 ‘the others’
         live where Teteru lives, etc.’(2503)   sjuping'waja-nahere                 (2504)   auto're-nahere
         Chupinguaia-COL                              bird-COL
         ‘the inhabitants of Chupinguaia’             ‘(the) birds’(2505)   dai='bwa-da-ki          koreja=txu'hǊi-nahere
         grab=finish-1S-DEC knife=small-COL
         ‘I took all the knives’   The collective morpheme is also applicable to verb roots, in which case it
functions as a nominaliser. As expected it can also be zero-verbalised again:
480   5. The verb phrase(2506)    kǊrǊi-nahe're-a-xa-ki
          fry-COL-1P-AS-DEC
          ‘we are (of the) Kanoê people/clan’271The verbal bases to which -nahere is added can be morphologically complex.
Compare the following examples:(2507)    o'kja-nahere                      (2508)       o'kja-a-hͿ-nahere

          ‘the hunters’                                  ‘we who are hunters’(2509)    o'kja-'Ϳ-tsy-nahere
          hunt-ATT-POT-COL
          ‘the future hunters’ (who have never hunted so far, e.g. small boys)(2510)    o'kja-tsy-nahere                  (2511)       o'kja-ƭ?ƭ-nahere
          hunt-POT-COL                                   hunt-REM-COL
          ‘those who are going to hunt’                  ‘those hunters of the past
           (also if they’re asleep now)                  (of olden times)’
5.6.6. Nominaliser -teWhen applied to a verb root, the nominaliser -te produces a kind of resultative
noun. This noun refers to an entity by the property which is the consequence of
the action or process expressed by the (semantically attributive) verb root:(2512)    he'bo-ki                      hebo-'te
          blind-DEC                     blind-NOM
          ‘he becomes blind’            ‘blind man’(2513)    'ho-ki                        ho-'tİ
          rot-DEC                       rot-NOM
          ‘it is rotten’                ‘rotten stuff’(2514)    wo'tsu-ki                     wotsu-'tİ
          skinny-DEC                    skinny-NOM
          ‘he is/becomes skinny’        ‘the skinny one’ (t)(2515)    kore'we-da-ki                 korewe-'tİ
          pregnant-1S-DEC               pregnant-NOM
          ‘I’m pregnant’                ‘pregnant woman’271.The Kwaza refer to the Kanoê as kǊ'rǊinahere because the colour of their skin is
    considered as yellowish, as if they are lightly fried.
                                                         5.6. Nominalisation   481    When in juxtaposition with another noun, the result noun can function as a
modifier. The modified noun is at the same time an argument of the verbal root
of the result noun:(2516)   atxi'txi hu-'tİ                    (2517)    e'cǊi hebo-'te
         maize sprout-NOM                             eye blind-NOM
         ‘muda of maize’                              ‘blind man’(2518)   uru'hu xare'ja-ki 'au ho-tİ
         vulture search-DEC flesh rot-NOM
         ‘the vulture is searching for rotten meat’(2519)   uru'hu 'au jo-'nã-tja                au     ho-'tİ    ja-'nã-tja
         vulture flesh devour-FUT-CSO flesh rot-NOM eat-FUT-CSO
         ‘the vulture wants to eat meat, is going to eat rotten meat’   When a classifier intervenes between the verb stem and the nominaliser, the
resulting noun and the classifier itself represent the subject of the verbal root:(2520)   dehe-mǊ-'te
         bitter-CL:liquid-NOM
         ‘pinga, cachaça’ (lit. ‘bitter drink’)The non-literal meanings suggest that these combinations may be somewhat
lexicalised. This construction is usually found with two of the attributive verbal
roots which were discussed in (4.3.2.2.) and which obligatorily contain a classi-
fier: ko- ‘empty’ and txi- ‘very big’.(2521)   ko-xy-'tİ                  (2522)        txi-kãi-'tİ
         empty-CL:house-NOM                       big-CL:leg-NOM
         ‘empty house, white paper’               ‘macaw’ (lit. ‘bigfoot’)In juxtaposition with another noun, the nominalisation is the modifier of the
subject of its own verbal root:(2523)   kawa'pİ     txi-hͿ-'te (2524)            ko'reja'ri    txi-ri-'te
         cockroach big-NOM-NOM                    plate         big-CL:flat-NOM
         ‘big cockroach’                          ‘big plate’(2525)   mabi'sƭ txi-sƭ-'te
         lead.shot big-CL:seed-NOM
         ‘bullet’ (lit. ‘big lead shot seeds’)Meanwhile, the resulting noun itself may of course function as an object in the
matrix sentence:
482   5. The verb phrase(2526)    awy-mǊ-'tİ             'kui-da-mͿ
          cold-CL:liquid-NOM drink-1S-VOL
          ‘I’m going to drink cold liquid (which is normally hot, e.g. tea)’One construction with an intervening classifier was attested in which the juxta-
posed noun is probably an object argument of the embedded verb root:(2527)    ko'sa e-mǊ-'tİ                   a'we
          sun have-CL:liquid-NOM rain
          ‘it rained sun-water’ (i.e. it rains while the sun shines)272   In the following examples, the element -te is attached to nouns. Because it
seems to have an intensifying connotation, there may be a relation with the in-
tensifying morpheme -te(te). The construction is rather lexicalised.(2528)    mƭu-'tİ                      (2529)       ha'ri?ixu-'tİ
          chicha-NOM                                bean-NOM
          ‘one who drinks a lot of chicha’          ‘one who eats a lot of beans’   Note that nominaliser -te is often pronounced as [tİ], homophonous with the
classifier -tİ ‘round’, as illustrated in (4.2.2.4.). It has not been established
which of them is represented in the following word:(2530)    txuhǊi-kuty-'tİ
          small-CL:head-???
          ‘small model propane flask’
5.6.7. Instrument noun -niteWhen applied to verb roots, the morpheme -nite produces an instrument noun.
This noun may refer to the instrument with which the action expressed by the
embedded verb root can be executed:(2531)    o'ri-ki                        ori-ni'te
          climb-DEC                      climb-INSTR
          ‘he climbs’                    ‘ladder’(2532)    'co-ki                         co-ni'te
          rasp-DEC                       rasp-INSTR
          ‘he is rasping’                ‘rasper’
272.Note that the word awe probably functions as a verbal root here, of which the mood
    marker has been omitted.
                                                           5.6. Nominalisation   483With certain verbs, the subject of the verb root may be equivalent with the in-
strument:(2533)   'wi-ki                          wi-ni'te
         cut-DEC                         cut-INSTR
         ‘he cut (the latex tree)’       ‘knife for latex cutting’ (t)(2534)   iri'txi-ki                      iritxi-ni'te
         cover-DEC                       cover-INSTR
         ‘he covers’                     ‘lid’(2535)   wy'ru-ki                        wyru-ni'te
         grind-DEC                       grind-INSTR
         ‘he grinds’                     ‘mill, pestle, mortar, for grinding’The root of the verb which forms the basis for the instrument nominalisation
may contain morphological complexity:(2536)   'tãi-dy-ni'te
         hard-CAU-INSTR
         ‘thing to lock’ (lit. ‘thing to make something tough’)The verb root may also retain overt arguments:(2537)   a'we hoñͅ-ni'te
         rain hide-INSTR
         ‘umbrella’ (lit. ‘thing with which to hide for the rain’)The instrument noun can occur in a modifying juxtaposition with another noun:(2538)   (ywy'nwͿ) Ǌtje=takaisa-ni'te
         tree           leave=traverse-INSTR
         ‘bridge’ (lit. ‘(tree) thing which is left to traverse’)   With certain verbs, the result of nominalisation by -nite is not an instrument
noun, but a result noun: it refers to the object with respect to which the action
indicated by the embedded verb root was executed:
(2539) auxwa'na ke-ni'te
          flesh        smoulder-INSTR
          ‘fried meat’(2540)   boboni'to      kǊ'cͅ         he'dy-nite
         maize.boiled brazil.nut mix-INSTR
         ‘porridge/mixture of boiled maize and Brazil nut’
484    5. The verb phrase(2541)     a'ruxy-nite awͿi-'ja-da-day-hͿ
           draw-INSTR see-IO-1S-1S-NOM
           ‘the photo I took’   Furthermore, the result of nominalisation by -nite can be a patient object of
the embedded verb root:(2542)     kuitõi-ni'te     wai-'dy-ta-ki
           swallow-INSTR good-CAU-1O-DEC
           ‘the pill/medicine got me better’   In the following example, the patient object of the embedded verb root is at
the same time the result of the action or process indicated by the embedded
verb root:(2543)     atxi'txi bİ-to-ni'te
           maize heat-kernel-INSTR
           ‘roasted maize’    Possibly, verb roots involved in result noun and patient noun creations are
not subcategorised for any instrumental argument. Apparently, it depends on
the specific verb root what is the result of the application of the morpheme
-nite. Therefore it is likely that many derivations with -nite have become
somewhat lexicalised:(2544)     hu'dada-ni'te
           speak-INSTR
           ‘word’Furthermore, not all verb roots may receive the nominaliser -nite:(2545)     wãwã'wͿ-a-nãi                (*wãwãwͿ-ni'te)
           dream-1P-NOM                 dream-INSTR
           ‘dream’   It is possible that the morpheme -nite is etymologically related to the nomi-
naliser -te (see 5.6.6. above) and the causational element -nƭ- (see 5.5.9.).273
273.I am indebted to Peter Bakker (pc) for this idea.
                        Chapter 6
             Adverbs and adverbial expressions
Kwaza has a number of lexical items which can be regarded as adverbs. They
resemble nouns in that they occur as free lexical stems. Furthermore, many can
be zero-verbalised by the attachment of person and mood markers. In such con-
structions, they function as verb roots, just like nouns may. Like simplex, i.e.
monomorphemic nouns, simplex adverbs are not recognisable as adverbs by
their form. Along with monomorphemic adverbial lexemes, there are also mor-
phologically complex adverbs in Kwaza. Although nouns may be morphologi-
cally complex as well, the morphology involved in adverb formation is differ-
ent. Nevertheless, certain affixes may form ambiguous lexemes which can be
regarded with equal justification as adverbs or as nouns.
    The distinction between verbs and adverbs is not always easy to draw either.
Verbs are usually morphologically marked by person and mood markers. Zero-
verbalised adverbs are morphologically not distinguishable from verbs. Fur-
thermore, verb roots do occur as free lexemes under ellipsis of person and
mood marking (see 7.5.1.), and as such they look like adverbs. Finally, a verb-
modifying adverb may resemble the first member of a complex verb root in a
serial compound construction (see 7.4.1.).
    Unlike nouns, prototypical adverbs neither occur as arguments of a predi-
cate, nor do they apparently modify other nouns. Also, there are important dif-
ferences in the morphological behaviour of nouns and adverbs. Unlike verbs,
adverbs occur as free particles which do not only modify a verb phrase, but
which may have a wider distribution and scope. Moreover, freely occurring
verb roots require a specific context in which the subject and mood are known,
whereas adverbs do not require this. Because of these reasons, I consider the
adverbs as a separate grammatical category, distinct from nouns and verbs.
    In subsection (6.1.), I will discuss the basic adverbs. In subsection (6.2.) I
will treat morphological operations and idiosyncrasies involving adverbs. This
includes adverbialisation and nominalisation with an adverbial function (these
were not treated in chapter (5.) on verbs). The category of subordinate adver-
bial clauses is treated in section (8.2.) of the chapter on complex constructions.","[517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523]"

8.4.1.2. Headless attributive clausesBesides juxtaposition, another property of attributive modification that is also
attested for attributive clauses is the fact that the head of the attributive con-
struction can be “omitted”. Apparently, headlessness is optional:(3639)    a'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki     (tswa) 'mİ̘-hata-hͿ
          see-1S-NOM-DEC man          hit-3S.2O-NOM
          ‘I saw that one (man) who beat you’396395.The order 21 is also allowed.
396.Note the inverse: 'mİ̘-da-hͿ-ki         a'wͿi-hata-hͿ
                         hit-1S-NOM-DEC see-3S.2O-NOM
                         ‘I beat that one who looked at you’
690    8. Subordination and coordinationThe following example lacks in principle an overt subject head, i.e. the “per-
son” which killed the pig:(3640)    dutu're hu'hui-ty-hata-hͿ       axe'hͿ-da-ki
          pig      beat-DET-3S.2O-NOM find-1S-DEC
          ‘I encountered that one who killed your pig’The following example contains an idiomatic pattern for a certain type of ex-
pression.397 The attributive clause which is employed lacks in principle an overt
subject head of its embedded verb, i.e. “you”:(3641)    e'tay-xa-re   cutsikja-ro'tİ-xa-hͿ
          woman-2-INT stand-CL:door-2-NOM
          ‘are you a woman, the way you keep standing in the doorway?’398In this and in other headless types of expression, there may be an overt object
not representing a head:(3642)    ka'tay-xa-re   kǊ'cͅ          ja-xa-'hͿ
          agouti-2-INT brazil.nut eat-2-NOM
          ‘are you an agouti, that you are eating (so many) Brazil nuts?’In the next example, the “omitted”, or perhaps better “understood” head is also
the subject, i.e. the “thing” which kills while the object “rat” is overtly present:(3643)    waru'ka huhui=a'sa-a-hͿ             e-xa-'re
          rat      kill=leave-1P-NOM          have-2-INT
          ‘do you have a rat trap?’The contrast between the subsequent examples demonstrates the omission of an
overt object head:(3644)    ay-'hͿ        bo'nİka 'ta-wa-hͿ
          that-NOM bonİka talk-IS-NOM
          ‘that one called “puppet”‘, ‘that one they call “puppet”‘ (t)(3645)    tã'jã ta-wa-'hͿ
          chief talk-IS-NOM
          ‘the one whom they call “chief”‘, ‘the one called “chief”‘397.This does not imply that the occurrence of headless attributive clauses is limited to
    idiomatic expressions.

                                                      8.4. Nominal clauses   691The next example also lacks an overt object head, i.e. “door”, which was
woven (by an indefinite subject, that is) out of braided palm leaves and which
is used to close things:(3646)   hetsy'se-ko ce-wa-'hͿ        ku'ro-wa-hͿ
         broom-INS weave-IS-NOM close-IS-NOM
         ‘(door) braided out of palm leaves to close off things’The following examples lack in principle both an overt object head and an
overt embedded subject:(3647)   Ǌcenãi-'he-xa-hͿ     ere'we-xa-ki
         know-NEG-2-NOM       write-2-DEC
         ‘what you don’t know you’re writing’(3648)   cari=a'sa-(wa)-hͿ    e'xyi=exyi='le-Ϳ-ki
         shoot=leave-IS-NOM hair=hair-only-ATT-DEC
         ‘him whom they killed had very long hair’In (3647), the nominal clause, with the understood object “unknown things”
and the understood subject “you”, functions as an object in the matrix clause.
In (3648) the nominal clause, with the understood object “victim” and the un-
derstood subject “killer”, functions as a subject in the matrix clause.
    The Kwaza property of attribution, which allows omission of a head is re-
lated without doubt to the property of predication that allows the omission of
overt arguments. Also the possibility of zero-verbalisation has a nominal
equivalent. The following example contains what can be regarded as an inher-
ently headless attributive clause, c.q. zero-modification:(3649)   mãrİ̘ri'tsa-wa-hͿ kwİ'nİ-wa-ki
         person-IS-NOM     enter-IS-DEC
         ‘someone has entered here (while we were away)’Remember that Kwaza does not have an indefinite pronoun. The literal transla-
tion of the subject mãrİ̘ritsawahͿ is ‘an indefinite being who is a person’ or
‘indefinite beings who are persons’. It is based on the zero-verbalisation
mãrİ̘ritsawaki ‘they are persons’ of the noun mãrİ̘ritsa ‘person’. On the other
hand, nominalisation of zero-verbalised nouns is not really a special grammati-
cal category by itself. The next example shows that such nominalisations can
be headed too:

         ‘we kill peccary pigs, the big ones who bite people’ (t)The nominal clause duture hajeretsyhͿ means literally ‘wild pigs which are
peccaries (Tayassu tayacu)’.
   Note that in many of the headless structures given here, the actual presence
of an overt head was never attested. The use of overt heads in these cases
would probably not be felt as a “natural” way of speaking.","[727, 728, 729, 730]"

8.2.7. Contemporative -nãi=hedyThere is a contemporative construction which is best viewed as an adverbial
clause. It involves the verb root hedy- ‘to mix, to put in’ in the following way:(3458)   'ywynwͿ      'dy-da-nãi=he'dy zjwãu        oja'nͿ-ki
         tree         cut-1S-NOM=mix João           arrive-DEC
         ‘while I was cutting a tree, João arrived’The construction does not require that the events always occur perfectly con-
temporary, and sometimes it is translated as if the event described by the matrix
predicate occurs immediately after the event described in the adverbial clause:
                                           8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses      653(3459)    onİ=bu'ru-da-nãi=hedy         ku'ru-ta        tsirjͿ-'he-da-ta
          come=arrive-1S-NOM=mix swollen-CSO tread-NEG-1S-CSO
          ‘soon after I had arrived, (my leg) swelled up and I could not stand on
          it (I limped)’ (t)On a different occasion the same sentence was translated as ‘because my leg
swelled up I limped as I arrived (i.e. that is how I arrived)’. In the following
examples, the events can only be subsequent:(3460)    'kui-da-nãi=he'dy        hy'ja-da-ki
          drink-1S-NOM=mix         fall-1S-DEC
          ‘after I drank I fell’(3461)    'kui-nãi=he'dy      hy'ja-ki
          drink-NOM=mix fall-DEC
          ‘after he drank he fell’   If =hedy is identical with the verb root hedy- ‘to mix’, the place in which it
occurs and the fact that it is uninflected are unusual. No similar constructions
exist which involve other verb roots. When asking the consultants about =hedy
they comment that “it means ‘meanwhile, soon after”. It is possible that it
emerged from an elliptic construction such as the following:(3462)    hade-'tõi     he'dy se'Bola he'dy 'trigo he'dy 'kezjo
          pepper-CL:eye mix onion     mix flour mix cheese          he'dy-da-ki
          mix-1S-DEC
          ‘I put in pepper, onion, flour and cheese’372
8.3.   Cosubordination: medial clausesAs shown in section (5.2.), the main predicate in a Kwaza matrix clause is
normally marked for person cross-reference and mood. As shown in sections
(8.2.) and (8.4.), subordinated clauses either have an adverbial function or an
argument function, and the subordinated predicate may be terminated by a
nominalising morpheme. There is another type of subordination which does not
belong to the foregoing category. I have called the resulting construction “co-
subordinative” in accordance with Foley and Van Valin (1984).373 Cosubordi-
nation occurs in chains of verbal expressions, in which one predicate acts as the372.I suppose that cosubordinative inflexion has been omitted in this example. It was ut-
    tered by MA who summed up the ingredients of the pizza in front of him.
373.A few examples were already given at the beginning of section (5.2.).
654    8. Subordination and coordinationmain predicate and bears matrix clause mood marking, while the others precede
this predicate and are marked for cosubordination. The cosubordinated predi-
cate represents a “medial” clause. There are two basic types of medial clauses:
those which have a subject which is identical to the subject of the subsequent
clause and those which have a different subject. The medial clause with an
identical subject ends in -t(j)a (glossed here as CSO: ‘cosubordinate’), and the
medial clause with a different subject ends in -si (glossed here as SWR: ‘switch
reference’). If both subjects are third persons, -ta ‘CSO’ is preceded by -dy-
(glossed here as DS: different subject’).
    The cosubordinated verb suffix is a “chameleonic” kind of mood marker. It
is attached to person cross-reference marking and it often “copies” the matrix
verb mood semantically:(3463)    bilo'tswa     e-'he-da-ta        okja-'he-da-ki
          shotgun       have-NEG-1S-CSO hunt-NEG-1S-DEC
          ‘I can’t hunt because I have no shotgun’(3464)    dodotxi'tİ o'hui-wa-ta        'nãi-wa-ki
          ball         play-IS-CSO      like-IS-DEC
          ‘they (do that because they) are playing ball’374(3465)    si isi'hͿ-da-si    o'ri-hͿ-ki
          I secure-1S-SWR ascend-NOM-DEC
          ‘I helped him climb up’In the above examples, the intended mood of the cosubordinated verb is de-
clarative, identical to the matrix verb mood. Other matrix moods are also pos-
sible:(3466)    ca'ri-da-ta     'jo-da-mͿ
          shoot-1S-CSO devour-1S-VOL
          ‘I’m going to shoot and devour him!’ (t)(3467)    ti-'rjͿ          oja-'nã-tja    kunͿ-djo-'re
          what-CD:area leave-FUT-CSO dress-CL:foot-INT
          ‘he is putting on shoes to go where?’So in contrast to adverbial clause markers, the cosubordinated clause marker
has no fixed semantic value. It procures its meaning from the context.
   This construction is employed for the expression of purpose, causation, rea-
son, consecutive and overlapping events and other complex sentences. The co-
subordinated clause is also found to act as a complement of the matrix verb, as374.Or, more emphatically, nãiwahe'rejã're ‘that’s why they do that, you see!’ when ex-
    plaining to someone who is not familiar with the phenomenon at all.
                                          8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses   655an adverbial adjunct or as a coordinated clause. Narratives may consist of very
long chains of clauses in the cosubordinative mood. These cosubordinated
clauses are best analysed as “medial” clauses; Kwaza may be a “clause-
chaining” language (Dik 1997b:439, Longacre 1985:283, Payne 1997:321).
   Notice that the cosubordinative verb falls within the scope of matrix Tense-
Mood-Aspect marking of the matrix verb:(3468)    huru'ja-da-ta au're-da-'day-hͿ-ki
          like-1S-CSO     marry-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘because I liked her, I married her’
          ‘I made love to her and I married her’(3469)    awe-'nã-tja       kyry'ja-ki ,... bİ'rİ-damͿ-'tja
          rain-FUT-CSO thunder-DEC thunder-want-CSO
          ‘it is going to rain and thunder,... and there will be lightning’(3470)    İ-toto-'mã-da-ta                  barİ-'nͿ-da-mͿ
          go-DR:upward-DR:water-1S-CSO warm-REF-1S-VOL
          ‘I’m going to go up there to warm myself up’(3471)    kui=hã'rã-da-ta      'İ-da-mͿ
          drink=stop-1S-CSO go-1S-VOL
          ‘when I have stopped drinking, I’ll go away’But the cosubordinative verb can also bear its own negation or tense:(3472)    butje'hͿ-a-nãi      areta-'he-da-ta      okja-'he-da-ki
          shoot-1P-NOM        know-NEG-1S-CSO      hunt-NEG-1S-DEC
          ‘I can’t hunt because I don’t know how to shoot’(3473)    o'ja-tse     dodotxi'te ohui-'nã-tja
          leave-DEC ball            play-FUT-CSO
          ‘he went there to play ball’375Medial clauses do not represent complete grammatical sentences. They are in
principle always subordinated to a matrix clause. Translations offered by the
consultant of an isolated matrix sentence also suggest this:(3474)    o'nİ-ki                   o'nİ-tja
          arrive-DEC                arrive-CSO
          ‘he arrived’       vs.    ‘when someone arrives and does something’375.Permitted alternative order: 231.
656   8. Subordination and coordinationIt is hard to say whether the cosubordinative cross-reference morphemes are
bound morphemes, since they occur sometimes as free morphemes. I chose to
treat them as suffixes, in analogy with person and mood marking of matrix
verbs. In the following sections the formal and functional properties of medial
clauses will be discussed in more detail.","[690, 691, 692, 693, 694]"

8.4.1.5. Multiple attributive relationshipsWhen transitive verb phrases with two overt arguments are nominalised, the
modifying relations may become double-layered. In the next example jerexwa
‘jaguar’ is both the object of the matrix verb awͿi- ‘see’ and the subject of the
embedded verb dwͿ- ‘break’. The object of dwͿ- is ekai ‘leg’:(3663)   jere'xwa 'ekai 'dwͿ-hͿ      a'wͿi-da-ki
         jaguar leg break-NOM see-1S-DEC
         ‘I saw the/a broken-legged dog’The entire internally complex nominal clause is an object argument of the verb
awͿi-. The internal structure of this object may be viewed from two different
perspectives. The grammatical relationships can be regarded as attributive, in
which perspective the head jerexwa ‘dog’ is juxtaposed with a dependent modi-
fier. This modifier is internally complex as it contains an embedded object:
ekai ‘leg’. An alternative way to interpret this structure is predicative. In that
perspective the example represents a nominalisation of an entire verb phrase
with two embedded arguments. A third interpretation combines the different
perspectives. The difference between these approaches can be illustrated
through a contrast between bracketing structures which symbolise the different
embedding relations. In this notation, the elements that modify one another
through means of juxtaposition are separated by square brackets:   a)    [[jerexwa] [[ekai] [dwͿ-hͿ]]]
         ‘broken-legged dog’   b)    [[jerexwa] [[ekai dwͿ]-hͿ]]
         ‘dog which has a broken leg’   c)    [[jerexwa ekai dwͿ]-hͿ]
         ‘dog which has a leg which is broken’In analysis (3663a), dwͿhͿ modifies its object ekai, the result of which, ekai
dwͿhͿ, means ‘broken leg’. This entire phrase again forms a nominal modifier
to its subject jerexwa and bears the sense of ‘broken-legged’. However, in
696   8. Subordination and coordinationanalysis (3663c) there are no modifying relationships at all; only the argument
relationships. (3663b) represents an intermediate analysis. These three repre-
sentations reflect different possible interpretations of the relationships within
the nominal clause. As far as the attributive relationships are concerned, the ex-
ample is ambiguous between (3663a) and (3663b). In view of the basic prop-
erty of attributive constructions, that is, modification is realised through juxta-
position, it is not necessary to assume a big scope for the nominaliser -hͿ.
Therefore I tend to consider (3663a) to represent the most plausible analysis.","[733, 734]"

5.2.3. ImperativeThe imperative mood marker -ra is used to indicate the speech act of com-
manding by which the hearer can be required, requested or invited to do some-
thing. The imperative marker attracts stress.(1355)     wady-'ra                     (1356)     wa'dy-e'teja-'ra
           give-IMP                                give-1PO-IMP
           ‘give (it to him)!’                     ‘give (it) to us!’(1357)     e'tay-nahere-wã wa'dy-ja-'ra
           woman-COL-AO give-IO-IMP
           ‘give (it) to all women!’(1358)     Q:     İ-'nã-da-ki               A:     İ-'ra
                  go-FUT-1S-DEC                    go-IMP
                  ‘I’m going’                      ‘go!’182Two possible subjects have been attested for imperative verbs: second person
singular, which is zero-marked, and second person plural, which is marked by
-xa-. Zero-marking is explicitly indicated only in the first two of the examples
below:(1359)     ka'we     kui-Ø-'ra                   (1360)   ka'we     'kui-Ø-xa-'ra
           coffee drink-2-IMP                             coffee drink-2-AS-IMP
           ‘drink coffee!’ (2sg)                          ‘drink coffee!’ (2pl)(1361)     xyi'tsİ tͅi'tja    o'ja-xa-'ra
           you.PL alone       leave-AS-IMP
           ‘you are going without them!’ (2pl)(1362)     xyi'tsİ o'ja-e'te-xa-'ra        (*o'ja?e'texaxa'ra)
           you.PL leave-COMIT-AS-IMP
           ‘you are going with them!’ (2pl)These examples show that in contrast to the declarative, where unmarked per-
son represents third person, the default value of the imperative is second per182.According to MA this answer is a bit harsh. Nicer is: tsy're ‘would it be?’
302   5. The verb phraseson. The second person plural imperative is marked by -xa-, and this form con-
trasts with second person plural form -xa-xa- of the declarative and other
moods. The following examples represent strong evidence for this:(1363)    xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-ra                      xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-xa-ki
          you        hit-AS-IMP                   you       hit-2-AS-DEC
          ‘you hit!’                    vs.       ‘you hit’(1364)    xyi aky-'ta        e'mã-xa-xa-ta o'ja-xa-ra          Ba'hozo-na
          you two-ANI        more-2-AS-CSO leave-AS-IMP        Barroso-LOC
          ‘you three, go to Barroso!’As explained in (5.1.), the element -xa-xa- consists of the second person ele-
ment -xa- and a homophonous associated person marker -xa-. Considering the
fact that second person is zero-marked for the singular subject of the impera-
tive, it is likely that it is also zero-marked for a plural subject. Therefore, the
element -xa- in the second person plural imperative represents associated per-
son, and not second person.
    In spite of the fact that -xa- in most imperative sentences represents a plural
subject, there are examples of the imperative in which -xa- is used for second
person singular. In the next example, which is from a mythical tale, the en-
chanted tapir is being addressed by a group of women:(1365)    huruja=du'hͿ-İteja-xa-ra
          like=all-1PO-2-IMP
          ‘make love to us all!’ (t)Compare this example to (1356). The tapir from this tale is a singular being
with a solitary life. And far as I am aware no special register was used in this
tale. Therefore, I have interpreted -xa- as a second person subject marker.
    Imperative verbs were never attested bearing any other subject person
marking than either zero or -xa-. Imperative verbs can be marked for any kind
of object and the same forms are used as in the declarative, with one exception.
The declarative first person object -ta- corresponds to the imperative (and
monitory) first person singular object -ta?Ϳ-:(1366)    wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-'ra (*wadytara)          (1367)    aredy'ta-ta?Ϳ-'ra

         see-NOM-1SO-AS-IMP
         ‘help!’ (lit. ‘you pl. look at me!’)   The negative imperative is expressed by a different morpheme -ky, which
will be treated in (5.2.7.). Nevertheless, some instances of a negative mor-
pheme in combination with imperative -ra were attested. They are rather em-
phatic:(1371)   ehͿ-'he-ca-ra                   (1372)    ja-'he-ca-xa-ra
         make-NEG-EMP-IMP                          eat-NEG-EMP-2-IMP
         ‘don’t do that!’                          ‘(since you didn’t work)
                                                   you (PL) are nót going to eat!’Note that -ra is not immediately attached to negative -he- in this construction.
The intervening element -ca- will be discussed below in section (5.2.3.3.).
5.2.3.1. -tsy- as an imperative elementNo mitigated version of the imperative has been identified with absolute cer-
tainty. Sometimes the imperative can be expressed by an alternative construc-
tion which involves the potential/future morpheme -tsy-:(1373)   hako're    oja'nͿ-e-ra     / hako're             ojanͿ-'?e-xa-tsy-tse
         tomorrow return-again-IMP/ tomorrow              return-again-2-POT-DEC
         ‘tomorrow you (sg/pl) come again’The next examples show that the alternative imperative construction with po-
tential -tsy- may also be zero marked for second person just like the canonical
imperative construction is (note that both are embedded as reported speech
constructions, see 5.5.11.).(1374)   hã    mǊi-'ra-tsy-le-'hͿ                   bõ'rõ-tse

304   5. The verb phraseThe difference between overt and zero marked second person in the imperative
construction with potential -tsy- is discussed in section (8.1.1.1.).
    The consultant regarded the imperative content of the alternative expres-
sions as equally strong or equally nice. On one occasion, however, the potential
construction was indicated as a mitigated and possibly euphemistic alternative
to the imperative:(1376)   wayrjͿ-'ra          /      way'rjͿ-xa-tsy-tsİ
         clean-IMP                  clean-2-POT-DEC
         ‘clean!’                   ‘you may clean’
5.2.3.2. -ta as an imperative elementThe procrastinative morpheme -tara- ‘later’, ‘do first’ was discussed above and
demonstrated in example (1268). In the declarative it cannot precede -ki but
only -tsİ. In the imperative it can only be succeeded by a verb-final element -ta.
This element -ta is not a cosubordinative marker, as it is clearly imperative in
combination with -tara-.(1377)   e'hͿ-tara-'ta
         make-PROC-IMP
         ‘do that first! (before going away)’(1378)   ka'we 'kui-tara-'ta                       (1379)   here?ece-'hͿ-tara-'ta
         coffeedrink-PROC-IMP                               rest-NOM-PROC-IMP
         ‘drink coffee first!, wait for the coffee!’        ‘rest first!’Maybe -ta should be regarded as an allomorph of -ra, although it only occurs in
this construction. The morpheme -tara- is involved in several different con-
structions and will be treated by itself in section (5.5.19.).","[339, 340, 341, 342]"

6.1.   Basic adverbsKwaza has a limited number of basic adverbs. There are two kinds of basic ad-
verbs. One is represented by independent lexemes which are morphologically
simplex. The other one consists of lexemes which show morphological com-
plexity but which are not productively formed. The following list contains all
attested simplex adverbs of the first kind:
486   6. Adverbs and adverbial expressions(2546)   ãi               ‘far, distant’
         da'nͿ            ‘still, yet’
         ele'le           ‘very (EMPH), only (EMPH.PL)’
         hade'ja          ‘by night’
         ha'ja            ‘by day’
         hary'ky          ‘now, then (interjection of hesitation)’
         ƭ                ‘idly, in vain, nothing’
         ja               ‘already’
         ka'le            ‘actually, in reality’
         ka'tsy           ‘soon, quickly’
         la'to            ‘yesterday’
         tsãrãrã'te       ‘low’
         tsǊ'hǊ           ‘what?’
         txa'rwa          ‘first, now, today’
         wa'txi           ‘truly, correct’These adverbs are etymologically neither easily relatable to one another, nor to
other known lexemes. The next list contains the adverbs which behave as mor-
phologically simplex adverbs but which show internal morphological structure:(2547)   anãi'dy          ‘rightly, properly’
         a'renͿ'ta        ‘noon’, ‘the hours before noon’
         a'rwalİ          ‘long ago’
         awani'hͿ         ‘alone’
         bony-            ‘next, again’
         İhͿ?İ'hͿ         ‘suddenly’

         haja?ƭ'si        ‘every day’
         hajediko're      ‘early in the morning’
         hako're          ‘tomorrow’
         ƭ'wã             ‘nothing, in vain’
         jale'ja          ‘in the past’
         keredy'ta        ‘carefully, slowly, softly’
         tͅi'ñe           ‘once, only’
         tͅi'tja          ‘alone’
         tjahİ'rjͿ        ‘elsewhere’
         tsiri'tsa        ‘in the middle’
         txatxarwa'te     ‘just now, suddenly, for the very first time’
         watxi'le(-)      ‘finally’, ‘so, then’Note here the occurrence of elements which resemble productive morphemes
such as -hͿ (NOM), -nãi- (NOM), -dy- (CAU, POS), -wã (AO), -ta (CSO) and -tja
(CSO). Note also possible roots such as are- ‘turn’ (at noon the sun is going to
                                                              6.1. Basic adverbs     487change its course from rising to descending). Note furthermore the recurring
root forms such as tͅi- (which may be related to tei- ‘one’274) the empty root a-,
and the adverbs ja ‘already’ and haja ‘day’. Note finally reduplication of İhͿ.
These morphological regularities have to be considered as fossilised. In the first
place, as the main word accent in Kwaza always falls on the last syllable of the
root, the apparent suffixes noticed here have to be considered as inalienable
parts of the root. Secondly, the ostensible morphological structure cannot be
altered, because, as an example, -hͿ cannot be replaced by another morpheme:
*awani-ki, *awani-xy, etc., and hence, -hͿ is not a productive nominaliser or
classifier here.
    The adverbs are canonically employed to modify predicates. The following
examples illustrate this for the adverbs of list (2546):(2548)    ãi     'a-ki

          ‘I’m going to move to another place’The adverb tsiri'tsa ‘in the middle’ will be discussed in (6.2.1.), and txatxar-
wa'te ‘just now’ in (6.2.2.).
    Although adverbs often precede the main verb, their position in the sentence
is actually quite free:(2575)    da'nͿ     turwe-'he-da-ki           (2576)    e-'mǊ 'e-ki da'nͿ

          first      Margarida first            birthday-CAU-DEC first
          ‘today Margarida had her birthday’277   Nevertheless, there are limitations. In the next example the adverb is em-
bedded in a complement clause. Of the three logically possible positions, the
position in which the adverb is separated by a clause boundary from the verb it
modifies is not allowed:(2578)    (*lato)      u'te-da-mͿ (la'to)         kukui'hͿ-da-nãi         (la'to)
          yesterday tell-1S-VOL yesterday ill-1S-NOM                      yesterday
          ‘I’m going to say that I was ill yesterday’    Sentences may contain multiple adverbs, and one of the adverbs may mod-
ify the other adverbs. In such constructions one adverb often modifies the ver-
bal root of the subsequent adverb, as in (2579) and (2580), but this is not al-
ways the case, as in (2581):277.The adverb can be placed in any alternative position in the sentence. The expression
    involving Benefactive/Causative -dy- must be a calque on Portuguese fazer aniver-
    sário, lit. ‘make anniversary’.

and occur as roots of matrix predicates, nominalised verbs, etc.:(2582)    'ãi-ki      (2583)    ãi-'hͿ-da-ki       (2584)       'ãi-Ϳ-xy

          ‘is the turtle still there?’                ‘is the turtle still there?’Few cases were documented of medial clauses (see 8.3.) used as adverbials.
The following example shows a medial clause marked for switch reference and
based on an adverbial root:(2587)    ha'ja-Ϳ-si     mƭu       kui-da-da-'ta-da-ki
          day-ATT-SWR chicha drink-1S-1S-CSO-1S-DEC

          RED-like-CSO day-ATT-SWR what-NOM know-1S-DEC
          ‘every day I understand better’Note, however, that ha'ja?Ϳsi is sometimes also pronounced as ha'ja?ƭ'si ‘every
day’:278.This is actually an adverbial clause, the structure of which will be discussed in
    (6.2.4.1.).
                                                         6.1. Basic adverbs   491(2589)   na-'nãi-tja     ha'ja?ƭsi    'hudada-'ta-da-ki
         RED-like-CSO    every.day speak-TRA-1S-DEC
         ‘every day I speak with him (in order to teach him)’On one occasion this was explicitly reported to be the correct pronunciation.
Furthermore, a similar expression involving hakuri ‘moon, month’ was consid-
ered to be children’s speech: hakuri?ƭsi ‘every month’. Possibly haja?ƭsi is a
lexicalising variant of haja?Ϳi.
    Not all adverbs have the same properties. The adverbs hary'ky ‘now’, ƭ
‘idly’, txa'rwa ‘first’ and most of list (2547) were never attested with verbal
morphology. Many adverbs have relatively ideosyncratic properties. The ad-
verb kale ‘actually’, which contradicts presuppositions, is often combined with
a matrix verb ending in the resignation morpheme -tsy:(2590)   ka'le     'İ-tsy-hͿ-tsy
         actually go-GER-NOM-RES
         ‘actually (he did not sleep here but) he went away’(2591)   ka'le      na-ay-'hͿ          mã-a-ra'ti-tsy    ka'le kwa'za-ta
         actually PROX-that-NOM call-1P-FOC-RES actually Kwaza-CSO
         ‘it is actually him which (the Aikanã) call Kwaza’In the next example kale probably modifies the entire proposition rather than
the single predicate:(2592)   ka'le    hİin Ϳ'nͿ-da-hͿ-tsy
         actually Hein be.called-1S-NOM-RES
         ‘(I’m known as Henrique, but) actually I’m called Hein’  The emphatic element elele ‘very’ functions as an intensifying adverb in
combination with a preceding nominal:(2593)   na-ay-xu'ko         ele'le 'a-ki       (2594)    e'tay ele'le
         PROX-that-SETT      very exist-DEC               women very
         ‘he lives in the same place’                     ‘just the women’ (t)(2595)   'si-dy-hͿ   ele'le
         I-POS-NOM very
         ‘only mine, my very ones (and not someone else’s)’In addition to its function as an emphatic adverb, elele also functions as a nu-
meral element (see 4.5.), which is probably a derived function.
   The interrogative adverb tsǊhǊ ‘what?’ can with just as much right be con-
sidered as a noun, verb or adverb. It is often zero-verbalised and used for a
matrix verb:
492   6. Adverbs and adverbial expressions(2596)    tsǊ'hǊ-xa-re
          what-2-INT
          ‘what do you want?’, ‘what happened to you?’It is often case marked as if it were a noun:(2597)    tsǊhǊ-'du                  (2598)     tsǊhǊ-ra'ti-wã jari'mã ja-'re
          what-BER                              what-FOC-AO jarimã say-INT
          ‘what for?’                           ‘what does “jarimã” mean?’It may occur as the basis of a noun modifier:(2599)    tsǊhǊ-ra'ti mani'ni ja-da-'re=jã-hͿ
          what-FOC fish         eat-1S-INT=be-NOM
          ‘I don’t know what kind of fish I ate’In the following example it may be difficult to establish whether it has to be
interpreted as an adverb, a verb argument, or a complement:(2600)    tsǊ'hǊ pİ̘rİ̘'jã-xa-re
          what      speak-2-INT
          ‘what are you saying?’    The adverbs are quite a heterogenous category. The element haryky ‘now’
has another, possibly derived meaning of indicating a hesitation or a pause in
one’s speech, without wanting to pass one’s turn of speech on to someone else.
It is also discussed in (7.7.4.).
    In the next example the canonical adverb ãi ‘far’ occurs twice:(2601)    'tana ãi     hã     du'ky-mǊ-na            ãi     o'ja-xa-tsy-tse
          well far water other-CL:liquid-LOC far go-2-POT-DEC
          ‘therefore you are going to another river far from here’ (t)It is unclear whether the first occurrence of ãi is topicalised here and repeated
later, or whether it functions as an adjective modifying the subsequent locative
phrase.
    There is one adverbial root in (2547) that is always followed by productive
morphology, but that is never used in another way than adverbial: bony- ‘next,
again’. In the following examples it bears the nominalising suffix -hͿ, although
it functions as an adverb:(2602)    bony-'hͿ    tsa'si-xa-tsy-tse
          again-NOM follow-2-POT-DEC
          ‘you will come next (I’m already going)’

          ‘I did not drink, later I will’In the subsequent examples, it bears the adverbialising suffix -wy:(2604)    bony-'wy     ja-da-tara-'tse

          ‘next time I will come to eat there (not now)’(2605)    bony-'wy      wa'ja-da-tsy-tse
          again-time bring-1S-POT-DEC
          ‘I will take her there later (not now)’The root bony- was never encountered with any other suffixes replacing -hͿ or
-wy. The difference with the attributive root duky- ‘other’ concerns precisely
this property. The form duky'wy ‘another time, on another day’ is used as an
adverb, but when -wy is replaced by -hͿ it functions as a noun. Furthermore,
-hͿ can be replaced by any other classifier. Therefore, duky'wy is the result of
productive adverbialising morphology, which is discussed in (6.2.4.), whereas
bonywy is based on a special adverbial root and hence, discussed in the present
section.
    There is no general semantic distinction between the first (2546) and the
second (2547) list of adverbs. Semantically defined groupings of adverbs such
as manner, time and evidential, may consist in both etymologically simplex and
complex lexemes. Adverbs referring to time of the day, for example, are found
in both lists. Besides these, there is a small number of time of the day adverbs
which are even formed through relatively productive morphological operations:(2606)    haja'jadyko're          ‘tomorrow morning’
          lato'wy                 ‘the day before yesterday’
          hakore'wy               ‘the day after tomorrow’
          (sile'ta                ‘afternoon’, ‘at dusk’, ‘at night’)
          tsiri'tsanã'wã          ‘midnight’The adverb hakore ‘tomorrow’ in list (2546) may consist originally of the
empty root a- and the directional -kore- ‘matutinal, of the morning’ but if it
were a productive formation, the initial “h” would not be expected. The adverb
hajadykore ‘this morning’ in list (2547) may consist originally of the adverb
haja followed by the possessive morpheme -dy- as if it were a noun, and the
directional -kore- ‘matutinal’ as if that were a classifier. However, this is also a
morphologically unexpected constellation. Partial reduplication as observed in
haja'jadyko're ‘tomorrow early’ in list (2606) is discussed in (6.2.2.) as a sepa-
rate morphological process in adverb formation.
494   6. Adverbs and adverbial expressions   The adverb tsiri'tsanã'wã ‘midnight’ consists of an irregularly formed ad-
verb based on the combination of a directional as discussed in (6.2.1.) and a
classifier as discussed in (6.2.3.):(2607)   tsiri'tsa-nãwã
         middle-CL:sky
         ‘midnight’   The adverb sileta ‘afternoon’ is possibly based on a verb root sile- ‘be
night’, which does not occur as an independent lexeme itself.(2608)   tsile'ta       wai'rjͿ-ki
         afternoon nice.weather-DEC
         ‘it is a beautiful afternoon’It seems unlikely that the element -ta can be analysed further. However, the oc-
currence of a different subject marker -dy- in the following rare example re-
minds of a cosubordinated clause (8.3.):(2609)   si'le-dy-ta       wã'wͿi-ki
         night-DS-CSO sleep-DEC
         ‘he slept in the afternoon’In this example, both verbs have different subjects and the literal meaning
could be ‘as it got night he slept’. However the free translation refers to the
time of the afternoon. The fact that medial clauses may sometimes have an ad-
verbial function was attested in (2587). In combination with the free translation
‘afternoon’, example (2609) suggests that the element -ta in sile'ta could be a
cosubordinative morpheme. However, the different subject marker is unexpect-
edly absent in the next example:(2610)   sile'ta        wã'wͿi-da-ki
         afternoon sleep-1S-DEC
         ‘I slept in the afternoon’Furthermore, sileta ‘afternoon’ may be embedded in a medial clause itself, as
in example (3437) in section (8.2.2.3). Because of this I regard it primarily as
an adverb, be it possibly with lexicalised morphology that sometimes betrays
its origin.
    The adverbs latowy ‘the day before yesterday’ and hakore'wy ‘the day after
tomorrow’ are the semantically unpredictable result of an otherwise productive
morphological operation, which is discussed in (6.2.4.1.).
    Adverbs of direction and location form a semantically definable sub-group
of adverbs. These adverbs are usually formed through the combination of an
empty root a- and a directional morpheme (see 5.3.). Because these adverbs are

7.3.   ReduplicationReduplication is a common morphological process in Kwaza and it has some
remarkable properties. It concerns not only lexical roots and constituent sylla-
bles of roots, but also cross-reference morphemes and other morphemes. Redu-
plication of cross-reference morphemes is one of the grammatical characteris-
tics of Kwaza that make it a rather unique language. This type of reduplication
is determined by morphological boundaries rather than by phonotactic units.
Furthermore, it expresses aspectual and even tense-like distinctions. The other
types of reduplication, such as root reduplication and reduplication of the root’s
first syllable, can occur with a number of different functions. In the present
section, mainly the phonotactically based types of reduplication will be de-
scribed. The different types of morphologically based reduplication were pre-
sented in the sections (5.5.2.), (5.5.4.) and (5.5.26.). The different kinds of re-
duplication in Kwaza also formed the topic of an article by van der Voort
(2003).
560   7. Other morphosyntactic structures7.3.1. Root reduplicationRepetition of the entire root occurs with repetitive, durative, progressive and
intensifying meaning. It is attested both with verbal and adverbial roots. These
functions were also illustrated and discussed in (5.5.27.) and (6.2.2.). Consider
the following examples:(2994)   hãidi=hãi'di-tse               (2995)   hãte=hã'te-da-mͿ
         drip=drip-DEC                           try=try-1S-VOL
         ‘it is dripping’                        ‘I’m going to try
                                                 (experiment, to do anything)’(2996)   hy=hy-'dwa-ki                 (2997)    haka=ha'ka-hͿ-tİ
         go=go-DR:onto-DEC                       old=old-NOM-NOM
         ‘he is walking (on) the path’           ‘very old thing’Furthermore, root reduplication was in some relatively lexicalised instances
attested to produce an attenuated effect. When reduplicated, the verb root wy-
‘to storm, rustle, buzz’ loses its possible “intense” connotation:(2998)   wywy'rjͿ-ki
         blow-DEC
         ‘the wind blows’Also the verb root kuri- ‘to stop, be quiet’ is in a way attenuated under redupli-
cation. The result is a somewhat fixed expression:(2999)   kuriku'ri-da-lİ          a'ky-da-tsy-tse
         a.little.later-1S-PREC take.food-1S-POT-DEC
         ‘I’ll take food after (you first)’Reduplication occurs in the iconic description of certain geometrical shapes.
On one occasion a verb root together with a satellite argument were redupli-
cated, and the result is rather iconic:(3000)   Ǌtİja 'bu-tse            (3001)    Ǌtİja=bu=Ǌtİja=bu=Ǌtİja='bu-tse
         side put-DEC                       side=put=side=put=side=put-DEC
         ‘it sits on the other side’        ‘it is a triangle’Productive reduplication of nominal roots is very rare and does not seem to
concern lexical nouns. There is one interrogative pronoun in Kwaza, di'lİ
‘who’, and it can be reduplicated with the accumulative sense of ‘who else’:
                                                              7.3. Reduplication    561(3002)    dilİ=di'lİ o'ja-xa-xa-re
          who=who go-2-AS-INT
          ‘who else went with you?’Cross-linguistically, the reduplication of “who” has often the meaning ‘who-
ever’ (Moravcsik 1978).
   Although reduplication is not the usual strategy to form numerals in Kwaza,
higher numerals are sometimes expressed by repetition of equal quantities:(3003)    bwa-ko'je=bwa-ko'je
          end-CL:hand=end-CL:hand
          ‘ten’ (fig. ‘five-five’)
7.3.2. Syllable reduplicationRepetition of a syllable of the lexical root may also occur with repetitive and
intensifying meaning. It is attested both with verbal and adverbial roots, which
was also illustrated and discussed in (5.5.27.) and (6.2.2.). Often it is the first
syllable which is reduplicated:(3004)    do-do'te-ki                 (3005)   tsitsİ-'wã e-e'sa-eteja-ki
          RED-shed-DEC                         we.EX-AO RED-sting-1PO-DEC
          ‘it is leaking’                      ‘many wasps stung us’ (t)(3006)    ca-ca'ri-ki     dutu're
          RED-shoot-DEC pig
          ‘he killed many pigs’Some monosyllabic roots that end in a glide are only partially reduplicated. The
onset and the nucleus are repeated, preceding the root:324(3007)    ho-'hou-lİ-a-ni
          RED-take-RECI-1P-EXH
          ‘let’s get people together (for a party)’Occasionally, it is the final syllable of the root that is reduplicated:(3008)    dury-'ry-ki
          roll-RED-DEC
          ‘it is rolling by itself’
324.Note that this and other examples were presented wrongfully as cases of syllable re-
    duplication in van der Voort (2003:74;76).
562   7. Other morphosyntactic structuresSometimes, it is not entirely clear which syllable is reduplicated. The following
example derives apparently from the verb bİje- ‘to pop’:(3009)   bİji'je-ki
         pop.RED-DEC
         ‘(the popcorn) is popping’On several occasions, different types of reduplication were attested for a certain
root. As an example, the verb root kahİ- ‘to bite’ can be repeated in its entirety
as kahİkahİ- ‘to keep on biting (ferociously)’, but also only its first syllable
may be reduplicated, with an attenuated meaning:(3010)   jere'xwa-tohoi       ka-'kahİ-nͿ-ki
         jaguar-CL:child      RED-bite-REF-DEC
         ‘the dog is biting (playfully)’The same was attested with the verb root rãmã- ‘to shake, tremble, rattle, reel,
dangle’, where either the entire root or the last syllable is reduplicated:(3011)   rãmã=rã'mã-tse
         shake=shake-DEC
         ‘it is rattling (because it is loose)’(3012)   rãmã-'mã-ki
         shake-RED-DEC
         ‘it is reeling, swaying upside down, trembling’Beside repetitive and intensifying senses, (partial) syllable reduplication can
also have a distributive function:(3013)   da-'dai-ki                          (3014)   da-'dai-da-ki
         RED-take-DEC                                 RED-take-1S-DEC
         ‘he is taking (away things)’                 ‘I am taking (away things)’(3015)   e-ehͿ-'ta       ojanͿ-'he-tse
         RED-make-CSO arrive-NEG-DEC
         ‘because she’s busy (doing all kinds of things), she didn’t come’(3016)   he-'hͅu-rjͿ-da-ki
         RED-sniff-CD:area-1S-DEC
         ‘I smelled/sniffed around’ (t)Furthermore, repetition of a root syllable was attested as a (not so productive)
means to indicate argument number, i.e. the difference between singular and
plural subjects or objects. In fact, in (5.4.10.) examples were presented in
                                                             7.3. Reduplication    563which the difference between syllable and root reduplication seems to indicate
a distinction between plurality and duality of the subject.325 However, this does
not seem to be a very productive operation. It was discussed in section
(5.4.10.), and here only one set of examples is given:(3017)    kui=hã'rã-da-ki             (3018)     kui=hãrã-'rã-ki
          drink=stop-1S-DEC                      drink=stop-RED-DEC
          ‘I stopped drinking’                   ‘many people stopped drinking’    Morphophonological variation in Kwaza is rare, also in reduplication. The
reduplicated variant of the nasal vowel Ǌ- in roots or root elements, as found
with a subject pluralising function, is the allomorph -mǊ-, as in bu?Ǌ'rjͿ- ‘to sit
(SG subject)’ vs. bu?ǊmǊ'rjͿ- ‘to sit (PL subject)’ and Ǌi- ‘to lie down’ vs.
u'mǊi- ‘to sleep (PL subject)’. Another case of morphophonological variation
concerns the repetitive morpheme discussed in section (5.5.31.) and mentioned
in (7.3.3.) below.
    The verbs discussed so far are intransitive. Partial reduplication of the tran-
sitive verb tsje- ‘to grab, close in’ indicates that the object is plural:(3019)    jere'xwa 'tsje-ki      duture-('wã)
          jaguar grab-DEC pig-AO
          ‘the jaguar grabbed the pig’(3020)    Ǌca'dy tsi-tsje-ƭ?ƭ-'hͿ-ki
          hawk      RED-grab-REM-NOM-DEC
          ‘it’s been a long time since the hawk grabbed (chickens)’Finally, reduplication can refer iconically to repetitive sounds and geometrical
shapes:(3021)    nõi-nõi-'nõita-'nͿ-ki (3022)       tsururururu='dote-ki
          RED-RED-dot-REF-DEC                murmur=shed-DEC
          ‘it is dotted (-----)’             ‘water is leaking away murmuring’
7.3.3. Reduplication of bound morphemesApart from repetition of root syllables which have no distinguishable meaning
of themselves, sometimes also bound syllables are repeated, which do bear se-
mantic or grammatical content. It is important to mention here the repetition of
bound cross-reference morphemes, which has past and habitual effects. This
was discussed exhaustively in the sections (5.5.2.), (5.5.4.) and (5.5.26.).","[597, 598, 599, 600, 601]"
"
5.1.1.1. Subject cross-referencea ‘1P’. The first person plural subject form -a- is the unmarked default form in
the distinction between inclusive and exclusive. In fact, only the exclusive is
marked, through the element -xa- in -a-xa-. An important reason why -a- by
itself could be regarded as inclusive is that the difference with first person -da-
otherwise would have to be explained in terms of a number distinction. Never

the exclusive situation. The distinction between inclusive and exclusive will be
further elaborated upon in sections (5.1.2.) and (5.1.3.). -a- is obligatorily used
for first person plural subject and can be combined with all possible objects.
    The rare allomorph -ay- occurs in the remote past construction (5.5.4.).da ‘1S’. The first person singular subject form -da- is glossed as ‘1S’ even
though the difference with -a- is probably not a number difference. -da- can be
combined with all possible objects.(1043)    si 'mİ̘-da-ki zjwãu
          I beat-1S-DEC João
          ‘I hit João’   The allomorph -day- occurs in the remote past construction. As shown in
(5.5.4.), it appears usually as a reduplicated form, preceded by the canonical
form -da-, and followed by a nominalising element:(1044)    na-ay-'wy        o'nİ-da-day-hͿ-ki
          PROX-that-time arrive-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘I arrived at that time’In certain nominal(ised) expressions which do not have a past reading, -day-
can occur by itself:(1045)    aky'nͿ-day-hͿ              (1046)    mama'ñͅ-day-'nãi are'ta-da-ki
          friend-1S-NOM                        sing-1S-NOM       know-1S-DEC
          ‘my friend’                          ‘I know how to sing’It is not perfectly clear why -day- occurs instead of -da- in these constructions.
Maybe there is a habitual connotation.xa ‘2’. The second person subject form -xa- may refer to singular or plural
subjects, and is hence glossed as ‘2’. It is homophonous with the third person
associated subject form -xa-. In rapid speech the pronunciation of -xa- may
change to [tsa]. Second person subject -xa- does not occur in combination with
first person singular object marking.(1047)    tsǊ'hǊ pİ̘rİ̘'jã-xa-re        (1048)    ǊnͿte'ta Ǌcenãi=du'hͿ-xa-re

          ‘what are you saying?’                  ‘do you know all stories?’ (t)   Like -day-, the allomorph -xay- occurs in the remote past construction
(5.5.4.), but note the rare occurrences of non-reduplicated nominal(ised) in-
stances of -xay- without a past sense:
250   5. The verb phrase(1049)    aky'nͿ-xay-nahere        (1050)       pİ̘rİ̘'jã-xay-'nãi  are'ta-da-mͿ

          ‘a friend of you people’              ‘I want to learn your language’xa ‘AS’. The third person associated subject form -xa- occurs as the second
element of the exclusive morpheme combination -a-xa- and of the Kwaza
equivalent of the second person plural -xa-xa-:(1051)    aku'tjǊ-nahe're-wa     a'wͿj-xa-xa-ki
          Indian-COLL-AO         see-2-AS-DEC
          ‘you are looking at the Indians’The fact that this morpheme is homophonous with the second person subject
morpheme -xa- creates the impression that second person plural is based on re-
duplication of the second person form: -xa-xa. However, a single -xa- can also
express a plural second person subject, as in (1055). Furthermore the element
-xa- is not reduplicated in the definite non-third person object forms. Also, it
not present in all transitive second person subject forms. Finally it is not always
present in intransitive second person subject forms in all moods, such as the
imperative (see 5.2.1.3.). In transitive inflexion, the associated form only ap-
pears with second person plural objects and indefinite objects (see table 23 be-
low).","[286, 287, 288]"
"43. As appears from his fieldnotes, Carlson (1984) interpreted the implosives of Kwaza
    like Aikanã as preglottalised plosives, e.g. <hÓ'!dİ> ‘let’s go’ (C:24), <'ja!da'ki> ‘I
    ate’ (C:34). Even though Vasconcelos (2002) also analyses Aikanã preglottalised
    voiced plosives, they are probably implosive phonemes // and /È/ that have plosive
    allophones [b] and [d] and that contrast with voiceless plosive /p/ and /t/. It should
    be noted that Purubora also seems to have [] and [È] (Tupi, Moore pc). In Kanoê
    implosive [È] occurs as an allophone of /r/ (Bacelar 2004).

necessary to mark this nasalisation in a phonemic notation or in the orthography./k/ is a voiceless velar plosive [k], as e.g. in /kikiñǊ/ [kiki'ÕǊ] ‘chigger’. Here is a

morphophonemic alternation (see 2.15.)./m/ is a bilabial nasal consonant [m], as in /mwİ̘mãtİdaki/ [mwҊİҊmã'tİÈaki] ‘I sank

45. This must have already been noticed in the late 1930’s by Lévi-Strauss: <wari-
    kadne> (L:51) in which the <d> probably represents [!] (/warikanİ/ ‘tree’). As far
    as I am aware, preglottalisation of [m] and [n] is relatively common in Aikanã, e.g.
    [!ma!ma'!ƭ:] ‘chicha’.

hears’:/ñ-j/         [Õã'siki]        ‘it is an ear’           [jѸã'siki]    ‘he hears’/p/ is a voiceless bilabial plosive [p], as e.g. in /pura/ [pu'ra] ‘moth’./p-b/         [paK'4a]      ‘nightshade’               [a4a'ja]       ‘tree species’
/p-m/         [pİҊ4İҊ'jѸãki] ‘he speaks’                [mİҊ'4ҔǊƭ!Óki] ‘it is blue’/r/ consists of a single apico-alveolar tap [4], as in /roroiki/ [4n'4nKki] ‘he mashes’.
It differs from /d/ by its non-implosive character. Minimal pairs between /d/ an /r/
were not encountered, but the difference is clear and obligatory in similar envi-
ronments:/r-d/         ['4aK!ÓhѸÓ]     ‘animal’                 ['ÈaKki]     ‘he took’
/r-l/         [mǊ'4i]          ‘rope’                   [mǊ'li]       ‘(bird species)’The dental non-plosive [d] is an optional allophone of /r/ word-internally.     [tӁ'4e]       ~         [tӁ'de]       ‘breast’
     [apa'4a]      ~         [apa'da]      ‘banana’
     [ã:'4ҔǊƭ]    ~         [ã:'dǊƭ]     ‘tapir’
     [paK'4a]     ~         [paK'da]     ‘jurubeba’
     [kuK'4a]     ~         [kuK'da]     ‘drink!’The nasalised allophone of /r/, [4Ҕ], occurs optionally in a nasal environment. In
that case, it turns out difficult to distinguish /r/ from [n], [Õ] or [jѸ]: /mãrİ̘ritsa/
['mã4İҊ4i'tsa] ~ ['mã4ҔİҊ4i'tsa] ~ ['mãnİҊ4i'tsa] ‘human’; /wairjͿki/ [waK'4ҔjѸãki] ~
[waK'Õãki] ‘(sky) is clear’; /nͿkarwarjͿki/ ['nÓka4wa'4ҔjѸÓki] ~ ['nÓka4wa'Õãki] ‘(the
river) became wider’ / ‘(the weeds) are covering a bigger area’; /wayrjͿra/
[waÓjѸã'4a] ‘sweep!’. However, in careful speech the distinction is always made.
This is corroborated by the following minimal pair:     [wa4a'ÕÓÈaki]           ‘I worked’                 [wa4a'4ҔjѸÓÈaki]   ‘I touched place’/s/ is a lamino-alveolar fricative consonant [s] of rather ‘sharp’ quality, as in:
/sirisiri/ ['sirisi'ri] ‘ant-eater, small tamandua’; /sururu/ [suru'4u] ‘fern tree’./s-x/         ['dÓ!asaki]        ‘he cut it up’              ['dÓ!asaki] ‘we cut it’/x/ is an apico-(post-)alveolar fricative [s] (henceforth symbolised as an extra re-
tracted [s]), as in /xoxoto/ [snsn'tn] ‘bacuri palm tree’. The tongue holds an inter-
mediary position somewhere between apico-palatal [] and alveolar [s]. Because
of its apical feature it may make the impression of a retroflex [], but the apex
                                          2.2. Value and status of the symbols used         55never goes back that far. In one family (family II) the /x/ is not always a clearly
apical [s], but can be realised in a more frontal (laminal) position, where it coin-
cides with [s], e.g. /exyi/ [e'sÓK] ~ [e'sÓK] ‘sting’. Although the distinction between
[s] and [s] is clear and obligatory, very few minimal pairs were encountered:/x-s/       [hesÓ'se]        ‘leaf’                    [hesÓ'se]      ‘broom’
            [sÓK]           ‘you (SG)’                [si]           ‘I’
            [kuK'nãsa4e]    ‘want to drink?’          [kn'sa]        ‘sun’There is no complementary distribution between /s/ and /x/, and the consultants
always correct forms in which the wrong sibilant is used. However, the combina-
tion /xi/ was not encountered on a phonemic level. It only seems to occur as a sort
of “apical harmony” in the following word: /mǊsixu/ [mǊ:si'su] ‘pestle (lit. ‘mor-
tar-stick’)’ (cf. /mǊsi/ [mǊ:'si] ‘mortar’). The pronunciation [mǊ:si'su] is accepted
but difficult to produce with its rapidly changing tongue positions. The sparsity of
[si] sequences confirms the fact that [s] is not a palatalised /s/, as [³i] sequences are
generally not avoided in languages that do have palatalised /s/.46
     Alveopalatal [³] is an optional allophone of /x/, as the result of a tendency of
/x/ to lose its apical feature when adjacent to a subsequent [e] or [İ]: /uixİ/ [uK'³İ]
‘tobacco leaf’ as opposed to /uixu/ [uK'su] ‘tobacco branch’; /Ǌxeki/ [Ǌ'³eki] ~
[Ǌ'seki] ‘he remains’; /axehͿhedaki/ [a³ehÓ'heÈaki] ~ [asehÓ'heÈaki] ‘I didn't find
it’; /terjaxİki/ [te4ja'³İki] ‘leaf is smooth’; /tuxe/ [tu:'³e] ~ [tu:'se] ‘capitiú’ or ‘ne-
gramine’;47 /tsİ̘xe/ [tsİҊ'³e] ~ [tsİҊ'se] ‘salt leaf (plant species)’; /uitsixe/ [uKtsi'³e] ~
[uKtsi'se] ‘(plant species)’; /hetsyxe/ [hetsÓ'³e] ~ [hetsÓ'se] ‘leaf’. As regards the lat-
ter examples this variation may be explained by the fact that /x/ has been adapted
to the non-apical tongue position as required by [ts] in the preceding syllable,
which results in [³]. In other contexts replacement of [s] by [³] is rejected: /xui/
*[³uK] ‘marico bag’, as [³] instead of [s] is characteristic of children’s speech
(CHS) and for second language learners, like the Aikanã, whose language does
not have /x/./t/ as in /tauta/ [tau'ta] ‘sloth’, is a voiceless dental plosive [t]. There is contrast
with implosives and other plosives and affricates:/t-d/       ['kuKtaki]      ‘drank my (blood)’        ['kuKÈaki]      ‘I drank’
/t-c/       [e'tǊƭ]         ‘fruit’                   [e'tǊƭ]         ‘eye’
/t-ts/      [tn'4n]          ‘urucum, soap’            [tsn'4n]         ‘arm’
46. Both Zack (1943) and Lévi-Strauss (1938) have symbolised [s] with (among others)
    <sr> on several occasions: <asre> (L:29), <ašĚé> (L:29+) /axy/ ‘house’, <ariisru>
    (L:46) /hari?ixu/ ‘bean’, <esrí> (Z:008) /exyi/ ‘hair’. This further corroborates the
    fact that [s] is not a palatalised /s/. Once, I even observed a contemporary pronun-
    ciation of /x/ as [s4]: /ixyi/ ME: [is'4i] ‘poison vine’.
47. It is not certain whether this is the same plant species.
56       2. The sounds of Kwaza/c/ is a voiceless post-alveolar apical plosive [t] (but not as apical as [s]), as in
/cutİki/ [tu'tİki] ‘he felled (a tree)’. It may be slightly palatalised. There may be an
(only very slightly) ejective quality to /c/. The /c/ could be considered as the plo-
sive counterpart of the fricative /x/, with which it is in phonemic opposition:/c-x/       [Ǌ'teki]        ‘left aside’            [Ǌ'xeki]         ‘stayed behind’The /c/ is very common but few minimal pairs with /t/ were encountered:/c-t/       [ãwҊãnÓ'teki]   ‘showed himself’        [ãwҊãnÓ'teki]    ‘is sad’
            [ete'4jѸÓki]    ‘it is close’           [İte'4jѸÓki]     ‘it is bright’
            [tu'ku]         ‘tongue’                [tu'4uki]        ‘woke up’Other pronunciations than [tu'ku] ‘tongue’ are rejected, e.g. *[tu'ku], *[tju'ku],
*[t³u'ku]. Note that the pronunciation [e'tnK] ‘eye’ was also encountered instead of
[e'tǊƭ] ‘eye’.
    The combination [tj] is to be interpreted as a realisation of /c/ in many cases. It
seems that before [a], /c/ has a tendency to be pronounced less with the tip of the
tongue and more with the blade of the tongue, i.e. more like a palatalised /t/ would
be pronounced: [tj]. Although sound spectrographic investigation indicated a con-
siderable phonetic difference between [tj] and [t], no minimal pairs were attested./ts/ is an alveo-dental affricate [ts], as in /tsiritsa/ [tsi4i'tsa] ‘in the middle’,
/tsetseritse/ [tsetse4i'tse] ‘butterfly’./ts-s/      [tsi'ki]        ‘younger sibling’       ['siki]          ‘he ties it’
            [jѸãtsi'4e]     ‘is it fat?’            [jѸãsi'4e]       ‘did you hear?’
/ts-t/      [tsn'4n]        ‘arm’                   [tn'4n]          ‘urucum, soap’
            [tse'Yeki]     ‘he throws’             [te'Ye!Óki]     ‘it is slanting’/tx/ is often an alveo-palatal affricate [t³], as in /txitxilu/ [t³it³i'lu] ‘grasshopper’,
/txatxarwa/ [t³at³a'4wa] ‘now (emphatic)’./tx-t/      [i4i't³iki]     ‘it is capped’          [i4i'tiki]       ‘it is mushroom’
/tx-c/      ['t³uÈamÓ]      ‘I'll heal’             ['tuÈamÓ]        ‘I'll fell’On many occasions, /tx/ was pronounced clearly as a sequence of an apico-
alveolar [t] and a very sharp lamino-alveolar [s]: /txisƭte/ [tsisƭ'te] ‘big bullet’. This
suggests that /cs/ would be a more adequate phonemic representation, but in order
not to deviate too much from the proposed practical orthography the symbol /tx/
was chosen throughout./w/ is a voiced bilabial approximant (in IPA terms: a voiced labio-velar ap-
proximant) [w], which occurs in onset position or as the second element in a con-
sonant cluster: /wywyrjͿki/ [wÓwÓ'4jÓki] ‘wind blows’; /akwamã/ [akwa'mã] ‘yam’.
                                         2.2. Value and status of the symbols used        57    The unrounded voiced bilabial approximant [w] is a conditioned allophone of
/w/ before /e/, /i/ or /İ/: /aweki/ [a'Yeki] ‘it rains’, /wiri?u/ [Yi4i'!u] ‘assai’, /winͿ/
[Yi'nÓ] ‘scissors’, /wİki/ ['Yİki] ‘took away’. Although the [w] can be encountered
syllable-initially before /e/, e.g. /wero/ [we'4n] ‘parrot (sp)’, and, rarely, before /i/,
usually [Y] occurs. Between /o/ and /i/ there is some free variation: /owi/ [n'Yi] ~
[n'wi] ‘maggot of the buriti’. [Y] was not encountered before /a/, /o/ or /u/. [Y] is
also found to replace the Portuguese loan phoneme (see 2.12.) /f/ in the borrowed
lexeme [ka'Ye] ‘coffee’ (POR café).
    [Y] does not normally succeed syllable-initial consonants as an onset glide. In-
stead, [w] occurs, and in that position it can be followed by any vowel, e.g.
/akarwİ/ [aka4wİ] ‘over there’, /hykwİki/ [hÓ'kwİki] ‘he enters’, /dwidwi/
[Èwi'Èwi] ‘flycatcher’ (bird of the fam. Tyrannidae).
    A syllable-initial combination of *[wu] (or *[Yu]) was never encountered.
    Immediately before a nasal vowel [wҊ] is nasalised. It is not necessary to mark
this nasalisation in the orthography./?/ is a glottal plosive [!].
    Glottal stop occurs at the periphery of the syllable. It occurs intervocalically
both at morpheme boundaries, and elsewhere.
    For reasons of transparency, a morpheme-internal glottal stop is treated as
phonemic in the present work. The following examples, which cannot be analysed
further morphologically, contain a phonemic glottal stop: /hari?ixu/ [ha4i!i'su]
‘bean’, /ƭ?ƭta/ [!ƭ!ƭ'ta] ‘always’, /jã?Ǌ/ [jѸã'!Ǌ] ‘menstruate’, /kuja?u/ [kuja'!u] ‘cu-
riangu bird’, /mãrİ̘?a/ [mãrİҊ'!a] ‘ghost’, /xa?u/ [sa'!u] ‘beetle’, /a?Ǌ/ [!a'!Ǌ]
‘deer’, /wiri?u/ [Yi4i'!u] ‘assai’.
    In other contexts, the glottal stop should be considered as automatic. There-
fore, it need not be written in word-initial and word-final positions in a phonemic
orthography. Consequently, words like [!a'!Ǌ] ‘deer’ and [!i'tsn!] ‘hammock’ are
written respectively as: /a?Ǌ/ and /itso/.48 The glottal stop is also automatic at
word-internal morpheme boundaries followed by a vowel-initial morpheme:(2)    [mƭǊ    ‘kuK!asaki]
       /mƭu     kui-a-xa-ki/
       chicha drink-1P-AS-DEC
       ‘we were drinking chicha’(3)    ['!a!a!a'wÓ]
       /a-a-a-wy/
        exist-1P-1P-time
       ‘since the time when we started to live here’48. Even in phonetic transcriptions I did not write it in word-initial position, except in
    the present argument about the glottal stop itself.
58     2. The sounds of KwazaNor is the glottal stop written in the phonemic orthography in this position, pro-
vided that the morpmeme boundaries are indicated by hyphens. Where there are
no such indications of morpheme boundaries, it should be written in word-internal
position. Furthermore, it should always be written in this position in a practical
spelling in order to avoid ambiguous boundary readings by its intended users.
Morpheme-internal glottal stops are always written.
    Word-initial [!] followed by a glide is extremely rare and occurs only in sound
symbolic expressions: /?wo?wo?woki/ [!wn!wn'!wnki] ‘(dog) is barking’. Among
non-symbolic expressions, very few combinations of glottal stop and subsequent
glide were attested, word-internally: /ukiri?wa?wa/ [!ukji4i!wa'!wa] ‘ant species’,
/-?wͿtİ-/ [!wÓ'tİ] ‘pity’, and morpheme-internally: /ƭ?jİ̘hͿ/ [!ƭİҊjѸİҊ'hÓ] ‘body’.
    The glottal stop can also be the result of optional preglottalisation of nasal con-
sonants: /danͿ nanãidaki/ [Èa'nÓ !na'!nãƭÈaki] ‘I’m still like this’.
    There is a tendency for Kwaza non-inflected words in isolation to end in an
unreleased post-vocalic glottal stop, e.g.: /jo/ [jn!] ‘manioc’. It may even occur
after glides, e.g. /mƭu/ [mƭǊ!].49 Word-final [!] may be related to phenomena of
stress, which in non-inflected words in isolation falls on the ultimate syllable:
/jerexwa/ [jere'swa!] ‘jaguar’. It is not heard word-finally that often in inflected
words, even if the last syllable bears stress: [kuK'nãÈa'ki] ‘I’m going to drink’. The
glottal stop rarely occurs word-finally after nasal(ised) vowels, e.g. in /kİiñǊ/
[kİK'ÕǊ!] ‘jatobá tree’, but sometimes lengthening of the vowel is heard: /kİ̘imǊ/
[kİK'mǊ(:)] ‘oil, fat, grease’.
    Sometimes, the word-final glottal stop sounds as an unreleased plosive conso-
nant: [k^] or [p^]. This occurs especially in narratives at the end of a sub-
paragraph, i.e. as if to mark a narrative boundary when a chain of events is termi-
nated and the next subsection will deal with a different or parallel chain of events
within the same story. In the second line of the following excerpt from a tradi-
tional tale (section 2.6. of the text volume), the verb root /oja/ [!n'jak^] ‘go’ is at
the end of a chain of events and is followed by a transition to the perspective of
another party:(4)    [wã4ã:ta'4a          'tawa'si   Èa'mÓ tja  wÓ4ahÓjѸã            ÈuhÓ'jѸã Èwa]

       everything “ah, that’s what they were doing”, he saw, “but we didn't know
       anything of it!”.’ (t)Aside from narrative discourse-bound occurrence of unreleased stops, one con-
trast between verb roots was encountered, which involved a root-final unreleased
stop inside of isolated words: /aruu/ ‘cross’ was observed without stop in /aruura/
['!a4u'4a] ‘cross!’, and /aru/ ‘jump’ with stop in /arucara/ [!a'4up^ta'4a] ‘jump!’.
The distinction between [uu] and [u] is difficult to perceive and it is possible that
it is emphasised by adding an unexploded stop to the latter. The roots /aruu/
‘cross’ and /aru/ ‘jump’ are semantically rather close, but there is also a morpho-
logical difference in the examples: the latter contains an emphatic morpheme -ca-,
which is used in combination with the imperative. This would imply that there
may be a morphophonological process involved. However, there seems to be also
free variation with respect to the presence or absence of an unreleased stop in the
root /aru/ ‘jump’: [!a'4ujetntn'4a] ‘jump on it!, jump upwards!’,
[!a'4uk^je'tntn'Èowta'4a] ‘jump onto it!’.
    It is possible to consider the glottal stop not as a phoneme, but as an automatic
phonotactic phenomenon that is generated by the basic CV syllable structure of
Kwaza. Word-initial vowels are automatically preceded by a [!]. And when an
open syllable (this means in principle: all syllables) is followed by a vowel-initial
syllable, a [!] is automatically inserted. However, it is impossible to do without
the symbol <!> in writing and meanwhile to keep syllable structure and morpho-
logical boundaries unambiguous. A word like /wiri?u/ ‘assai’ could either be read
correctly as [Yi4i'!u] or wrongly as *[Yi'4iu], /tsida?uty/ ‘daughter-in-law’ as
[tsiÈa!u'tÓ] or *[tsiÈau'tÓ], and /ekai/ ‘leg’ as [!ekaK] or as *[!eka!i]. Furthermore,
as was illustrated above, some glottal stops are lexically determined. As [!] shares
important functions with other consonants in the Kwaza phoneme system, there is
reason to treat it as a phoneme.","[90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97]"

5.2.9. MonitoryThe monitory mood is also one of the prohibitive moods. It is expressed by the
morpheme -tsi and it has a cautionary or admonitory value as it is used to warn
the hearer that something dangerous or unpleasant may happen. The zero-
marked person is the third person subject argument of the verb. Usually, the
subject is not identical with the hearer to whom the admonition is directed:(1497)    'hyja-'tsi                 (1498)       jere'xwa 'ja-tsi     auxwa'nã

agent, as in example (1501), but there is no reason to suppose that this corre-
sponds to the grammatical subject, because exactly the same situation obtains
in example (1502). There the grammatical subject is cross-referenced explicitly
by -wa-, the indefinite subject, which can impossibly be identical with the ad-
dressed hearer:(1501)    'kãu-tsi                       (1502)       hy'ri-wa-tsi
          break-MON                                   steal-IS-MON
          ‘take care not to break it!’                ‘watch out, people here steal!’
          (lit. ‘(watch out) it may break!’)          (CX: said to a newcomer)It is nevertheless possible for the hearer to be identical with the grammatical
subject, but this will have to be marked overtly by -xa-:(1503)    'rai?ͿhͿ hewedu'tu-xa-'tsi
          thing     forget-2-MON
          ‘don’t forget your luggage!’(1504)    awe-'mǊ         o'hui-he-'ky     kikalo-'e-xa-tsi
          rain-CL:liquid play-NEG-NEI fever-again-2-MON
          ‘don’t go playing outside in the rain, lest you get fever again!’193It is important to notice that the verb root of the monitory phrase in the latter
example is (like the former) not “controlled” by the subject, whereas the verb
root of the negative imperative phrase is. In fact, the subject is the very same
second person singular in both members of the paratactic construction.194 How-
ever, monitory verbs can also have second person subjects when they are con-
trollable verbs. This construction has a negative imperative connotation. Com-
pare the following two examples:
192.This sentence is probably a calque on the POR expression: nãõ deixe ele tomar olho,
    lit. ‘don’t let him take(=drink) eye!’ (the Portuguese verb tomar means both ‘to take’
    and ‘to drink’).
193.This is the complete version of the warning ED sent to her little daughter: awe'mǊ
    he'ky ‘(because of the) rain, don’t!’.
194.The context in which this sentence was recorded gave no reason to doubt at the sin-
    gularity of its subject.
324    5. The verb phrase(1505)    a-'wy     ja-'tsi                    (1506)     a-'wy     'ja-xa-tsi
          Ø-time eat-MON                                  Ø-time eat-2-MON
          ‘before he eats’                                ‘don’t eat yet!’This construction may be somewhat idiomatic because of the adverb awy ‘yet’
(see 6.2.4.1.). On one such occasion, the monitory mood marker was encoun-
tered deeper inside the verb, as if it can also function as a (preventive) modal
suffix (see also 5.2.9.1.):(1507)    a-'wy      'wotsu-tsi-da-ta
          Ø-time skinny-MON-1S-CSO
          ‘I do it before they emaciate’ (t)   The verb in the monitory mood may cross-refer to any object argument, in-
cluding the second person who is identical with the hearer:(1508)    du'mã 'mİ̘-hata-'tsi
          snake     beat-3S.2O-MON
          ‘take care, the snake is going to hit you (don’t let him)!’Monitory -tsi combines with overt cross-reference to a second person subject
by -xa- like most other moods, but unlike the imperative -ra. In spite of this,
overt first person singular object cross-reference is realised through -ta?Ϳ-,
which is the same for the imperative195, whereas most other moods use -ta-, in-
cluding the negative imperative:(1509)    wa'dy-ta-he-'ky                         wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-tsi
          give-1O-NEG-NEI                         give-1SO-MON
          ‘don’t you give me!’                    ‘don’t you give me!’This suggests that the monitory mood in Kwaza does have something in com-
mon with the imperative on the grammatical level after all. And on the seman-
tic level, it is sometimes difficult to imagine how the hearer cannot be identical
with the agent subject which is zero-marked in the next example:(1510)    oxote-'hͿ-ta?Ϳ-tsi
          wait-NOM-1SO-MON
          ‘don’t wait for me!’Still, I suppose that zero-marked subjects of the monitory mood are formally
third person subjects. The fact that literal interpretations like those of the next195.Except that it is sometimes pronounced in the monitory as [ta!ƭ]. This was the case in
    examples (1511) and (1519), but for statistical reasons I considered /-ta?Ϳ-/ as the
    correct phonemic representation.
                                                                       5.2. Mood    325examples seem a bit far-fetched is not a valid argument against this analysis.
For one thing, Kwaza does not have a grammatical category of passive voice.(1511)    do-'hͿ-ta?Ϳ-tsi                 (1512)         mİ̘-ta?Ϳ-'tsi (*mİ̘taheky)
          leak-NOM-1SO-MON                               hit-1SO-MON
          ‘don’t leak (hot tea) on me!’                  ‘don’t you hit me!’ (‘take
          (‘don’t let me be leaked on!’?)                care not to let me be hit!’?)   To a great extent the monitory -tsi can also be regarded as a negative
equivalent of the exhortative -ni. Their contrast is highlighted by the following
minimal pair:(1513)    jere'xwa ja-'ni                     (1514)     jere'xwa ja-'tsi
          jaguar eat-EXH                                 jaguar eat-MON
          ‘let the dog eat!’                             ‘don’t let the dog eat!’The monitory has nearly the same formal characteristics in being inflexionable
for the same subject persons. The monitory certainly differs from the exhorta-
tive in that it can be combined with second person singular subject cross-
rerefence too, as attested by example (1504).
    The monitory is probably a matrix verb mood. The imminence of danger
can be explicitly connected with a preventive measurement in the form of an
imperative or negative imperative verb phrase:(1515)    ku'ri-ca-ra      janãnãi-'tsi
          quiet-EMP-IMP good-MON
          ‘take care, shut your mouth, otherwise you will be eaten up!’196(1516)    magariDa-'wã du'ru=wady-ra tã'lo-tsi            enãi-'ca-hata-tsi
          Margarida-AO pour=give-IMP sulk-MON quarrel-TRA-3S.2O-MON
          ‘pour Margarida (tea) lest she will sulk, lest she will quarrel!’(1517)    e'nãi-he-ky          bui-'tsi
          quarrel-NEG-NEI leave-MON
          ‘don’t quarrel lest he will leave!’These preventive verb phrases are in matrix verb moods too. Therefore, these
complex clauses probably do not represent grammatically hypotactic construc-
tions. When there is no such preventive complement clause, the monitory
phrase has an implicit preventive value itself. So bui'tsi will probably mean lit-
erally: ‘(if you don’t do something) he will leave!’. In this way it has an im-
plicit negative connotation, and as such the monitory mood can be argued to
belong to the prohibitive moods inventorised in (5.2.10.) below.","[360, 361, 362, 363]"
"294.Unfortunately, main stress placement in the word kawİ was not registered. Here it is
    probably on the first syllable and in the previous example on the second syllable.

on relations of scope:(2776)    Q:     au'Beto-'le    a'wͿi-xa-re
                 Alberto-only see-2-INT
                 ‘you only saw Alberto?’          A:     ay-hͿ-'le        a'wͿi-da-he-'ki
                 that-NOM-only see-1S-NEG-DEC
                 ‘I did not see only him (I saw the other one too)’295In (2776) the subject did see the object Alberto, but not exclusively him. Ap-
parently then, the negative morpheme corrects a presupposition which is pres-
ent in the context of speech. In this case the presupposition to be corrected is
represented by the morpheme -le ‘only’. In the following example -he- seems
to negate -rata:(2777)    xyi-ra'ta        a'wͿi-xa-hͿ-he-ki
          you-first        see-2-NOM-NEG-DEC
          ‘you didn’t see it first (I did)’296
          (lit. ‘it isn’t so that you were the first one to see it’)Also in (2777), the subject did see the object, but he was not the first one to do
so. In the ensuing examples person-negative morpheme order may also be con-
nected with the counter of presuppositions:(2778)    si 'nãi-da-he-ki
          I like-1S-NEG-DEC
          ‘it wasn’t me’297(2779)    tsuhǊ-'du 'cu-da-he-tsy-tse        koreja-'ko

          what-BER-GER-PREC exist-TRA-1O-NEG-POT-DEC
          ‘what good would it be?, he couldn’t stay together with me’ (t)295.The full expression in Kwaza for ‘I did not only see Alberto, but the other one too’
    does not involve a negative, but a positive extra medial clause.
296.There is no unambiguous way to express: ‘you saw it last’.
297.On one occasion, the consultant MA said that this sentence consists of three words:
    si nãi daheki. This could be an indication that Kwaza is morphologically less com-
    plex than I presume. On the other hand, he said elsewhere that words can occur un-
    finished, and do require to be completed.
524    7. Other morphosyntactic structures(2781)    ute-'ta      duture cari-da-he-'ki=tse
          notify-CSO pig          shoot-1S-NEG-DEC=DEC
          ‘he said he did not kill a pig’298In the negative of the declarative mood, the zero-marked third person does not
cause ambiguity as regards presupposition. In the case of straightforward nega-
tion, the verb is terminated by -he-tse, and in the case of countersupposition by
-he-ki. In (2782) below, the speaker knows that the coffee is not sweet, and in
(2783) the speaker discovers that the coffee is, against his expectations, not
sweet:(2782)    hoi-'he-tse
          sweet-NEG-DEC
          ‘it isn’t sweet’ (speaker warns a hearer who intends to drink)(2783)    'hoi-he-ki
          sweet-NEG-DEC
          ‘it isn’t sweet’ (speaker establishes an unexpected fact)The context in which the next example was elicited represents circumstantial
evidence that it is countersuppositional:(2784)    wai-he-'ki
          good-NEG-DEC
          ‘it doesn’t taste good’This sentence was uttered in reaction to the remark: ‘what a tasty soup you’ve
made!’. A similar situation was observed in the next example:(2785)    'si-dy-hͿ    etohoi-he-'ki
          I-POS-NOM child-NEG-DEC
          ‘he is not my child’ (t)This sentence was uttered by a woman from a mythological story who had be-
come a misandrist and did not even want to recognise her own son any more. If
these examples represent negations of presuppositions, it may be assumed that
the zero-third person morpheme is located before the negator and the mood
marker: -Ø-he-ki.
   In family II, the combination -he-ki with zero-marked third person, seems to
be more common than in family I. The combination -he-ki cited in (5.2.1.1.)
probably indicates countersupposition as well, but more research is needed.
   The contrastive morpheme -hehͿ also has a countersuppositional use. Also
other morphemes such as desiderative -heta- ‘would like’, conjectural -here298.The context is probably that he killed something else.
                                                                     7.1. Negation   525‘think that, but’, -cehere ‘think that maybe’ and -here=jã-re ‘don’t you see!’
have an antithetic connotation. All these morphemes may contain the original
negative morpheme -he-, but because they do not really have a negative value,
they are discussed in the relevant sections of (5.5.).","[560, 561, 562, 563]"
"
6.2.1. The adverb formative root a-An important operation is the attachment of a directional morpheme to the
empty adverbial root a-. The result is a directional or locative adverb. As was
noted in (5.3.2.), this operation is quite similar to the formation of nouns by at-
tachment of classifiers to the empty nominal stem e-, which was discussed in
(4.2.1.11.). As an example, a verb root like oce- ‘throw’ can be extended by the
directional morpheme -toto- ‘upward’: oce-toto-da-mͿ ‘I’ll throw it up in the
air’. The same directional can be turned in an adverb in combination with the
empty stem a-:(2611)    a-to'to
          Ø-DR:upward
          ‘upward, over, on top’The next example shows the use of the directional -nõwͅ- ‘upstream’ in an ad-
verbial construction:(2612)    a-nõ'wͅ         mǊi-'ra
          Ø-DR:upstream submerge-IMP
          ‘fetch water upstream!’So far, most directionals presented in (5.3.) were also attested as adverbs in the
way described above. These adverbs have the same properties as the adverbs
described in the preceding section (6.1.). This is illustrated by the following
examples involving the directional -karwİ ‘away, over there, close by’:(2613)    eje-ka'rwİ-da-ki                 (2614)     a-ka'rwİ      'a-ki
          move-DR:away-1S-DEC                         Ø-DR:away exist-DEC

           ‘it is a bit (more) over there’         ‘the tree a bit (more) over there’Similar productive series of examples involving directionals are given in sec-
tion (5.3.) and the vocabulary in part (III).
    Some directionals occur also in less productive adverb formations. The di-
rectional morpheme -ritsa- ‘outside’ occurs besides in the directional adverb
aritsa ‘outside’ also in the locative adverb tsiritsa ‘in the middle’. The element
tsi- occurs as a root element in several verbs involving the notion ‘step, stand,
tread’, but quite lexicalised, and, except for tsiritsa, not as an adverb.279(2617)     tsi'ritsa 'bu-kja-da-ki
           middle put-DR:length-1S-DEC
           ‘I lay down in the middle’   As noted in (5.3.), some verb roots occur as a second member in verb com-
pound constructions and may function as directionals, e.g the verb root kwİ-
‘enter’ and terja- ‘slide downstream’. The use of these roots as directionals is
productive, and consequently they may also occur as directionals to form ad-
verbs with the empty root a-:(2618)     'kwİ-da-mͿ      a'xy-na      'a-kwİ 'cu=tsicİ-da-mͿ
           enter-1S-VOL house-LOC Ø-enter step=pile-1S-VOL

           Ø-downstream wash-IMP
           ‘wash it downstream!’    Not only directional elements are attached to the empty adverbial root a-.
The attributive root haka- ‘old’ may be originally of verbal nature (see
4.3.2.2.), but it occurs always as a classified noun. The word hakai ‘grandpar-
ent, old person’ may be etymologically related. Whatever the grammatical
status of haka-, it can be encountered inside of an adverb beginning with the
empty root a- and terminated by a suffix that probably originates from the in-
strumental nominaliser -te:
279.The element -tsa- occurs also as part of another directional -katsa- ‘in the middle of
    the road’, but it is not clear whether bukatsate ‘sitting in the middle of the road’ as
    attested in the story about the toad in part (II) represents a noun or an adverb. Other
    occurrences of -tsa- have nothing to do with any part of this notion.
                                                  6.2. Adverbial morphology   497(2620)   a-ha'kate a-'wy
         Ø-ancient exist-time
         ‘in olden times’ (t)   In (4.2.1.5.) the possibility of extending (directional) adverbs with classifi-
ers was mentioned. Such adverbs terminated by classifiers often behave as
nouns:(2621)   tsiritsa-tu-'na        cu'cu-ki
         middle-CL:back-LOC walk-DEC
         ‘he is walking in the middle of the slope’(2622)   *?tsiritsa-tu       cucu-ki
         middle-CL:back walk-DEC
         ‘the middle of the slope is walking’In example (2621) the adverb tsiritsa is followed by the classifier -tu- and sub-
sequently by the locative case marker -na. Example (2622) is anomalous pre-
cisely because the classified adverb is interpreted as a noun. The following
classified a- initial adverbs can hardly be imagined to have anything else but a
nominal interpretation:(2623)   a-'tatsitswa-kai              (2624)    a-haka'te-tay
         Ø-DR:under-CL:leg                       Ø-ancient-CL:woman
         ‘calf’                                  ‘a woman from olden times’ (t)Nevertheless, classified adverbs were also attested to maintain their adverbial
nature, as is suggested by the following examples:(2625)   a-toto-'xy                 aru'nja-leja      'ta-dy-ta
         Ø-DR:upward-CL:house leave-2O.FUT talk-DS-CSO
         ‘“I will put you up in the attic”, she said’ (t)(2626)   a-toto-'xy                   'bu-dwa-ki
         Ø-DR:upward-CL:house put-DR:onto-DEC
         ‘(the parrot) is sitting on top of the house’    Note that adverbs can apparently function as nouns sometimes even without
classifiers. The locative case marker -na in the following example suggests that
the adverb asilona ‘corner of the house’, which is based on the directional
-silona- ‘corner of the house’ is interpreted as a noun:(2627)   a-silona-'na         a'sa-da-ki      hetsy'se
         Ø-DR:corner-LOC leave-1S-DEC         broom
         ‘I left the broom in a corner’
498   6. Adverbs and adverbial expressions    Some directionals were only attested with the prefixed empty root a- when
followed by a subsequent classifier. It is not always clear whether the result is a
noun or an adverb. In the following example, the locative case marker -na is
evidence for the nominal status of aratsamǊ ‘on the bottom of the river:(2628)    a-ratsa-mǊ-'na               tsǊrǊnǊ'nƭ 'a-ki
          Ø-DR:under-CL:liquid-LOC sand              exist-DEC
          ‘there is sand on the bottom of the river’In another word order, however, the (optional?) absence of -na suggests it may
be interpreted as an adverb:(2629)    tsǊrǊnǊ'nƭ 'a-ki           a-ratsa-'mǊ(-na)
          sand          exist-DEC Ø-DR:under-CL:liquid-LOC
          ‘there is sand at the bottom of the river’There is even a verb root tewe- ‘slant, slide down’, which was encountered
with the prefixed empty adverbial root a- only if followed by the classifier -tu-
‘shoulder, back’:(2630)    a-tewe-'tu
          Ø-slant-CL:back
          ‘slope from one side of the hill over the top down the other side’Because atewe- of example (2630) is not attested without -tu, the combination
can be treated as lexicalised. tewe'tu itself is a noun that means ‘slope, hillside’
and atewe'tu, which means something like ‘down the slope’ can either be used
as a noun or as an adverb:(2631)    a-tewe-'tu          'a-da-ki
          Ø-slant-CL:back exist-1S-DEC
          ‘I live down there at the bottom of the slope’(2632)    a-tewe-'tu-na       'a-da-ki
          Ø-slant-CL:back-LOC exist-1S-DEC
          ‘I live on a slope’   Adverbial use of a bare verb root without classifiers, directionals or      the
empty prefix a- was also attested, e.g. the verb root takaisa- ‘traverse, divide’.
Furthermore, some bare nouns have been attested to function as adverbs too,
e.g. te'ja ‘(opposite) side of a place (river, settlement, road)’. Both are dis-
cussed in (6.2.3.).
   In the above it was shown how adverbs may be formed productively by the
semantically void root a-. The other components may be bound directional
morphemes, classifiers, verb roots and even nouns. It was furthermore shown
                                                    6.2. Adverbial morphology   499how adverbs without initial a- may also involve the same components. The fact
that morphologically unmarked category-changing operations are quite pro-
ductive only adds up to the possibilities. There are situations in which it is very
difficult to determine what the primal grammatical category of a certain lexical
root is, which greatly complicates the establishment of rules for adverb forma-
tion and use.
    Let me finally address the status of the semantically empty adverbial root a-
itself. It was noted in (5.3.2.) and (4.2.1.11.) that there was a parallel between
the empty nominal root e- and the empty adverbial root a-. Classifiers can be
attached to e- in order to form independent nouns, and directionals can be at-
tached to a- in order to form independent adverbs. Both e- and a- are homo-
phonous with basic verb roots, to wit e- ‘have’ and a- ‘exist, live, remain, be
born’ respectively. However, the e- and a- roots diverge with respect to their
distributional properties. Of the e- roots the distribution is practically comple-
mentary, since the empty root cannot be used with the sense of ‘have’ and since
the classifier cannot represent an incorporated object of the verb root ‘to have’.
Compare the following two examples:280(2633)    e-'tay-da-ki               (2634)         e-'tay         'e-da-ki

          ‘I’m a woman’ (*’I have a woman’)         ‘I have a woman’The distributional distinction between the two a- roots is not that clear. Conse-
quently, the a- root is sometimes ambiguous. In example (2635) a- seems eas-
ily identifiable as the empty adverbial root:(2635)    a-ri'tsa        a'wͿi-da-ki coha-si'ki
          Ø-DR:outside see-1S-DEC foot-CL:skin
          ‘I saw a shoe outside’ (S outside (looking in))281Earlier on, we have seen how adverbs can be zero-verbalised, and the result can
be a matrix sentence:(2636)    a-ri'tsa-ki
          Ø-DR:outside-DEC
          ‘he/it is outside’However, one could claim also that (2636) should be analysed in the following
manner:

         ‘he/it is outside’Such an analysis becomes even more plausible when it is confirmed by the free
translation given by the consultant:(2638)   a-toto-'mǊ-wa-ki

         ‘they live along the river’Fortunately for the present analysis, both a- roots can usually be kept distinct
on structural and semantic grounds.","[533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538]"
