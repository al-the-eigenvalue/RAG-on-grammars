2.3.1.10 Sposato (2014)
       Sposato (2014) is the first typological study on word order in Hmong-Mien.
He investigated the NP-internal word order (noun, numeral, classifier, possessor,
attributive adjective, relative clause, demonstrative, plural marker) and the NP-
external word order (subject, object, verb, copula, particle, oblique phrase,
adposition) in eleven Hmong-Mien languages based on publications authored in
Chinese. They are Hmong, Hmu, Xong, Iu Mien (of Thailand by Thanyalak Saeliao
2012), Bunu, Biao Min, Baheng, Suang, Younuo, Jiongnai, and She. As to the NP-
external word order he posits “SVO” (with Ratliff (2010:227-8) quoted in §2.3.1.7) as
follows:           All languages in the sample are straightforwardly SVO in pragmatically
           neutral clauses, although object-fronting (to either preverbal or clause-
           initial position) for discourse-pragmatic purposes is common in all of them.
           (As is standard in studies of word order typology, the term “subject” and
           “object” are here used in a purely semantic sense, with the former referring
           to the more agent-like argument of a transitive clause and the latter to the
           more patient-like argument of such a clause) (Sposato 2014:111).",[116]
"This is a good starting point to present our alternative view on the sacrosanct “SVO”
hypothesis as will be discussed in Chapter 4. It is true that the word order matters in
Iu Mien and it does show the ‘SVO’ order but the question is in what sense it does so.
It has already suggested that this issue is closely related to the “discourse-pragmatic
purposes”, which none of the eleven authors from China he depended on mention.
However, his pragmatic attitude of utilizing the term ‘subject’ and ‘object’ in a broad
sense is also helpful. We in the present study also heuristically make use of these terms
just as Sposato does for the sake of traditional view holders.
       With regard to the word order, however, our alternative view is based on
information structure following LaPolla (1993, 1995, 2003, 2006) for Chinese with
the assumption that Iu Mien is fundamentally a Topic-Focus language. An overview
of this stance will be explicated in Chapter 4.",[116]
"
4.2.6.3 Topic occurs preverbally, focus postverbally
        For the sake of easy reference to the surface structure, we will use the
traditional terms “subject” and “object” only in the very loose sense as Sposato (2014)
does as has been quoted in §2.3.1.10:          As is standard in studies of word order typology, the term “subject” and
          “object” are here used in a purely semantic sense, with the former referring
          to the more agent-like argument of a transitive clause and the latter to the
          more patient-like argument of such a clause (Sposato 2014:111).",[267]

 (747b)      [mv        zung       nzuqc.dorn         daix    meih],   [meih   daic     aqv].
             [ม้        ฒูง        หฑุ.ตอน            ไต๋     เม่ย],   [เม่ย   ไต่      อ๊ะ].

             ‘This dagger will kill you (and as a result) you will (surely) die.’
Thus the first clause is a two-argument structure, and the second a one-argument
structure.
         Therefore, based on both the diachronic and synchronic evidence, it is possible
to say that there is a distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs in Iu Mien.
However, this fact does not nullify our claim that Iu Mien is not primarily an SVO
language but pragmatics plays more important role in the word-order choice. Note
the contrastive examples of Downer (1973:14-16), quoted above, between the
transitive clause (748) and the intransitive clause (749): (748)       koi         gaengh
             คอย         แก้ง
             kʰɔi˦       kɛŋ˧˩
             open(vt) door
             ‘open the door’
             (Downer 1973:16)
 (749)       nqoi        biangh
             ฆอย         เปี้ ยง
             gɔi˦        pʲaŋ˧˩
             open(vi) flower
             ‘to blossom’
             (Downer 1973:16)
Why the reverse order biangh nqoi [flower open] is unacceptable must be discussed in
§11.4
         Another reminder that we do not abandon our stance that Iu Mien is not
strictly an SVO language comes from LaPolla’s (2002) argument as follows:          [...] a language that has not grammaticalized the syntactic category of
          subject will often have a relatively free word order based on pragmatics
          (usually information structure and/or animacy); [...] Assuming agent is
          equivalent to subject in all languages then is very problematic.","[622, 623]"
"
      The gist of the seven, i.e., the crux of Chapter 4, is that Iu Mien is a
pragmatically configured verb-medial language and it is not an SVO language in the
sense that the word order is strictly grammaticalised. In the overall bipartite sentence
template with the verb in the middle, the topic argument NP occurs pre-verbally; and
the focal argument NP and the event presentative NP occurs post-verbally. Although
this order may have a guise of an SVO order, the principle operates not only with the
verbal predicate but also with non-verbal predicate, i.e. equative particles (not verbs).
Thus, two major parts of the sentence are topic and focus, whether what comes                                           823
between them are verbs, verbal adjectives, copular verbs or equative particles, or
sentence medial topic markers. Given these facts, to say that Iu Mien is an SVO
language is to address only a small number of constructions that have such surface
appearance in the language.
      Regarding the principle of the multilayered rightward focus structure, i.e.,
Principle 2, the topic-focus construction can also occur within the focus part. That is
to say, the structure that the focal NP occurs on the right side of the sentence-medial
element can be recursive. The recurrence is facilitated by the use of topic markers, se,
yaac, aeqv, and nor. Each time one of these particles is uttered, the previous part as a
whole becomes a topic, which awaits for a new focus NP to occur. In other words,
these particles function as a subordinate clause marker. In addition, each time the
conclusion of the sentence is suspended by these particles, the previous focus turns
into a topic. When does the sentence conclude? When one of the sentence final
particles is uttered, it concludes. In this sense, SFPs are grounding elements (Principle
6), which has been analysed in Chapter 19. To summarise, the multilayered focus
structure (Principle 2) is at work in that the more rightward the constituent goes
(closer to the sentence-final position), the more focus it gets. Chapter 10 has seen that
Principle 2 and Principle 3 are operating in the sentence medial topic marking
constructions. Furthermore, that the coverb phrase occurs in the oblique position
before the main VP is in accordance with Principle 2, which has been argued in
Chapter 15.
      Another implication of Principle 3, that is, the principle that the verb-medial
word order does not mean the language is grammaticalised in the order SVO, is the
successful analysis of the seemingly post-verbal subject. The post-verbal NP is not the
subject nor an object. A new participant, which is not the established topic, is
introduced to the discourse by the entity-presentative verb maaih ‘there was a…’. In
such a construction, the non-topical NP occurs post-verbally, i.e., on the right side of
the verb. Other than this, in the constructions of the meteorological happening, the
unexpected emergence, the inexorability all occur post-verbally. When these
constructions are preceded by a topic NP, the appearance is NP+VS. However, such
an understanding does not explain anything. These are the event-presentative
constructions, in which the topic may occur pre-verbally, and the non-topical but
focal-NP occurs post-verbally. This is the principle of verb-medial order, not an SVO.
We have argued this issue in Chapter 11.
      We have also argued for the versatility of verbs in Principle 4. Verbs in different
degrees of grammaticalisation function as the main lexical verbs, the auxiliaries, the
aspectual marking verbs, the modal verbs, the semantic role coverbs, and the near                                          824
prepositions, which are on the way toward complete semantic bleaching. As a result,
MVCs can be formed, which are packed with verbs of different shades of meaning.
This characteristic has been argued in Chapters 12 and 15.
      Principle 5, a vague distinction across “parts-of-speech”, has been seen in
Chapter 6 that V + V compound becomes a noun; in Chapter 7 that an adjectival verb
can be treated as a noun; in Chapter 8 that no matter how long a clause is, it can be
treated as a big noun; in Chapter 10 that once any clause is marked by one of the topic
marking particles, it can function as a noun; and in Chapter 17 that the VP or clause
is taken as a conceptual event by duqv and zuqc. Therefore, we should not assume that
“parts-of-speech” are the universal categories. Rather, constructions of the language
should be examined language-specifically on its own terms. In this respect, the insights
from Construction Grammar are to be heeded.
      Principle 7, culturally affected argument structure, has been found in operation
in Chapter 11, specifically §11.2.2 on two-argument structure or the ditransitive
constructions. In the structure with the guise of “SVO”, the “O” can be in the role of
Source, Allative, or Goal. In such a situation, culturally inappropriate interpretations
must be pre-empted. Here again the SVO order has proved to be non-grammaticalised.
It is not true to the facts of the language to force a template of “SVO” to different
kinds of constructions. Rather, the individual construction of [Topic + V + S], [Topic
+ V + A], and [Topic + V + G] needs to be described in the rich semantic frame or
the cultural frame. This approach is also wise advice from Construction Grammar.
       We have also argued that the spatial constructions in Chapter 16, and that the
auto-benefactive-duqv ‘GET’ and the auto-malefactive-zuqc ‘TOUCH’ in Chapter 17 can
be analysed in accordance with the extended egocentric viewing arrangement. The
spatial deictic constructions are centred around ego. Actions, events, state of affairs
are perceived from the perspective of “good or bad to me?” through duqv or zuqc. We
have also established that Iu Mien only has the adversative passive construction by
zuqc. The adversative passive is drastically different to the common understanding
that Iu Mien is an SVO language. It is not the case that “O” in Iu Mien is promoted to
be “S”, and the original “S” demoted in the grammaticalised SVO order. The
adversative passive construction yie zuqc ninh mborqv [1SG TOUCHADVERSATIVE 3SG hit] ‘I
was hit by him/her’ is considered to be more subjective (i.e. hurtful) than the active
SVO order in Ninh mborqv yie [3SG hit 1SG] ‘he/she hit me’. The latter, in the mind of
the native speakers, is merely an objective statement. This analysis of subjectivity-
objectivity, which is subsumed in the egocentric viewing arrangement, is from
Cognitive Grammar.","[859, 860, 861]"

are realised as 7) high level tone and 8) low level tone respectively “with shorter
duration” (Purnell 1965:33). The representation of these tones in a practical
orthography will be shown in §3.3.1 – §3.3.3 in Chapter 3. However, without waiting
to reach these sections, it would be helpful to introduce the readers to the letters that
indicate tones because the language examples will be presented as early as in Chapter
2. In the so-called “Unified Script” or “New Roman Script” in the vernacular name
used among the Iu Mien in U.S.A., China, and France6 (and some parts of Vietnam),
the word final letter of each morpheme indicates tones. For example, mienh /miən˧˩/
‘person, people’ is composed of mien /miən/ and its lexical tone, the mid-falling tone
/˧˩/, represented by –h. In the following, the eight tones are shown with Chao’s graphic
tone marks in / / with IPA and the “Unified Script’s” tone mark in the parentheses: 1)
high-mid level /˦/ (unmarked), 2) mid-falling /˧˩/ (-h), 3) high rising-falling /˦˥˧/ (-v),
4) low rising-falling /˨˧˩/ (-z), 5) low rising /˨˧/ (-x), 6) low level /˩/ (-c), 7) high level
tone /˥/ (-v), and 8) low level tone /˩/ (-c). Tone sandhi, occuring in compound words
is indicated by a hyphen ‘-’ between two morphemes: e.g., laangz /laːŋ˨˧˩/ ‘village’ +
ziouv /tsjəʊ˦˥˧/ ‘host, owner, chief’ > laangz-ziouv /laːŋ˧˩ tsjou˦˥˧/ ‘village headman’,
where /˨˧˩/ (-z) of laangz changed to /˧˩/. Though the tone mark –z in spelling is
preserved in the compound noun, the hyphen ‘-’ between laangz and ziouv signifies
the changed tone /˧˩/ without using –h. Thus the system has an advantage of showing
both the underlying tone and the resultative tone that underwent tone sandhi. The
details, including one more tone sandhi rule, will be discussed in §3.3.3 and the
compounding strategies in Chapter 6.
         Typically Iu Mien words are monosyllabic, i.e., one word instantiated by one
syllable carries one lexical meaning without morphological inflections. This is only a
tendency, however, as Iu Mien also employs compound word formation having words
which are composed of, ranging from mono, and sesquisyllabic (i.e. one and a half)
to trisyllabic structure (Purnell 2012:xix).
         Iu Mien is a verb medial language. The monosyllabic nature of the language
demands that the word order plays an important role to determine grammatical
relation. Nevertheless, it does not mean that the language has a strictly
grammaticalised Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern as a basic constituent order.
Rather, the order is determined by pragmatic motivation of information structure.
That is, topic noun phrases tend to occur pre-verbally and focused noun phrases tend
to occur post-verbally7 (LaPolla 1995, 2006). Even though the seeming basic order6
  There used to be a newsletter from Iu Mien in France using the New Roman Script or the Unified Script
issued around the year 1987 and onward (Purnell, pers. com.).

  This issue will be further touched upon in §4.2.6.3 and discussed in detail in §11.4, i.e., pragmatically
motivated argument structure.","[38, 39]"
"4.2.6 Basic Constituent Order at the Sentence Level
            This section argues for the basicness of Topic-Focus word order. Contrary to a
common view that Iu Mien is an SVO language, such a word order in its bare form in
isolation is rather rare. Though there are instances of SVO, they are just
epiphenomenal as the better explanation is with recourse to pragmatic principles
rather than to syntactic one. Pragmatically explained, Topic occurs preverbally and
Focus postverbally.",[260]
"
4.2.6.1 An isolated SVO order is rare
            If one asks whether Iu Mien is an SVO language or not, the answer found in
this section is negative. This typological feature is commonly referred to. For example,
Blake (2001:15) summarises in terms of relation between the word order and
grammatical case: “The SVO ‘caseless’ languages are concentrated in western Europe
(e.g. English), southern Africa (e.g. Swahili) and east and southeast Asia (e.g. Chinese
and Vietnamese)”. In other words, Iu Mien, like Thai and Lao adding to those in the
parentheses above, does not use case marking but the word order to indicate
grammatical relations. Indeed, Clark (1989:178-9) argues for the SVO order in Hmong
and Thanyalak Saeliao (2012) likewise considers Iu Mien to be an SVO language.
            On the surface, it appears to be true. Pragmatically unmarked simple sentence
in its SVO order is exemplified in (144):    (144)     … mienh     gorngv    gouv
              … เมี่ยน    ก๊อง      โก๊ว
                 miən˧˩   kɔŋ˦˥˧    kəʊ˦˥˧
                 people speak       story
              ‘… people tell stories…’
               (ium_20000415_10_CT_DA_FmCiang_Clouds;00.03.05-06)
            In fact, the construction (144) is a part of a larger utterance. It is extremely
rare that a bare form of SVO sentence by itself occurs in a natural speech. Such a
sentence can be elicited through an artificial interview with a language consultant,
though.
            In actual speech some kinds of modifications like adverb or aspectual verbs
are most likely accompanied but the basic constituent order is still SVO. In (145) the
                                              224
verb is followed by an adverb deix ‘some’ and in (146) the clause is followed by a
motion/aspectual verb daaih ‘COME’.","[260, 261]"

         The next example consists of a dependent clause and a main clause sharing
one same subject in the order [S IntransitiveVerb Loc TOP, (S) TransitiveVerb O

             (ium_1998_01_TDK_DA_GueixZoih_MigHist;00.01.42-45)
The subject of the verb gapv ‘to build, assemble’ is Iu-Mienh, which is overt in the
clause (146-1) but ellipsed in the clause (146-2).
         In all examples (144) – (146), such tests as *gouv gorngv mienh [story tell
people], *waac gorngv yie [words speak 1SG], and *nzaangv gapv Iu-Mienh [boat
assemble the Iu Mien], respectively, receive immediately the native speaker’s reaction
that they are wrong semantically.
         Further constructions like the intransitive clause (SV), the ditransitive clause
(SV Direct Object – Indirect Object), will be discussed in Chapter 11.",[261]

4.2.6.2 Basicness of Topic-Focus order
       While the SVO order does occur at the clause level in Iu Mien, the topic-focus
order is dominant in actual speech events and discourse. Li and Thompson (1976), in
their classic argument of distinguishing the subject (at clause/sentence level) and the
topic (at discourse level), characterize a topic language as follows:         Perhaps the most striking difference between a Tp language and a non-Tp
         language is the extent to which the topic-comment sentence can be
         considered to be part of the repertoire of basic sentence types in the former
         but not in the latter. (1976:471)       Similarly, what Chao (1968) says about Chinese is also true to Iu Mien. Both
Chinese and Iu Mien exhibit a sentence such as (147a) and (147b): (147a) Juv      ngaatc mienh.
         จู๊     หงาด      เมี่ยน
         cu˦˥˧   ŋaːt˩     miən˧˩
         dog bite       person
         ‘A dog bit a man.’
 (147b) gǒu yǎo rén
        狗     咬       人
        dog bite person
        ‘A dog bit a man.’
        (Chao 1968:70)
Regarding the frequency of this type of clause, Chao (1968) analyses:         But in Chinese, the proportion of applicability of the actor-action meanings
         […] is still very low, perhaps not much higher than 50 per cent, and the
         wider conception of topic and comment is much more appropriate. The
         subject is literally the subject matter to talk about, and the predicate is what
         the speaker comments on when a subject is presented to talk about (Chao
         1968:70).","[261, 262]"

      Summary of Chapter 11
       This chapter started with four tests to identify verbs, the elimination of
adjectival verbs given they were discussed in Chapter 7, and the recognition of
transitive and intransitive verbs. These were preliminary issues.
       The main themes are (i) the argument structure, (ii) the presentative
constructions, and (iii) distinction between two types of word order constructions: [V-
NP] and [NP-V].
       First, the one-argument structure, the two-argument structure, and the three-
argument structure were investigated. Second, the entity-presentative construction
using maaih ‘there was/were’ and the event-presentative construction were discussed.
       The last part, which received a considerable space, explicated that the
seemingly post-verbal subject [V-NP] encodes natural (meteorological) happening,
unexpected emergence/appearance, and inexorability. On the other hand, the pre-
verbal NP in the construction [NP-V] encodes volitional agent.
       Therefore, it is not so meaningful to say that Iu Mien is an SVO language.
Rather, the speaker’s attitude and perception, i.e., volitionality or non-volitionality,
determines the word order.
       As we have discussed the argument structure, namely, the verbs and their
relations with themes around them, the next thing we shall consider are the internal
structure of action (i.e. aspects) and the speaker’s attitude toward events (i.e.
modality).","[646, 647]"

         A Seemingly Post-verbal Subject: Argument Structure of
V + NP.
         The purpose of this section is to respond to the following analyses by Sposato
(2014) particularly concerning with the “VS order”:          As the examples below show, all eleven Miao-Yao languages [Hmong,
          Hmu, Xong, Iu Mien, Bunu, Biao Min, Baheng, Suang, Younuo, Jiongnai,
          She] examined are predominantly SV. The opposite order, VS, does occur
          in many of these languages as well, but it does so far less often. In most
          cases VS order also seems to be restricted to particular verbs and/or
          discourse-pragmatic environments, though these issues are rarely afforded
          any explicit discussion by the authors196 of the sources used here (Sposato
          2014:114).",[636]

16.4.1 Spatial Construction Applied to “Time”
     Unlike Thai word order, tǚŋ wela [reach time] (ถึงเวลา) ‘It’s time’, Iu Mien say
{time}{reach}. That is, conceptually ziangh.hoc ‘time’ approaches ego, not that ego
approaches time as in (942-1-2):
                                             701

             Taux;00.12.57-13.02)
       More and more young Iu Mien nowadays use the structure taux ziangh.hoc
[reach time] instead of ziangh.hoc taux. What is the conceptual difference between the
two? Langacker argues that the objective viewing arrangement is different to the
subjective viewing arrangement in that the former does not include the speaker (or ‘S’
for self) whereas the latter includes the speaker in viewing the object (‘O’ for object
or others). The optimal viewing arrangement (Langacker 1987:129) is schematised in
Figure 62:
                                                       702

Figure 62. Langacker’s optimal viewing arrangement. ‘S’ stands for the viewer,
                   or SELF; ‘O’ for the object being observed (1987:129)       In analysing the conceptual structure of ziangh.hoc taux [time reach], we can
alter the direction of the arrow in (b) of Figure 62 to show that O (time) approaches
S (the speaker) and that the speaker perceives the event subjectively schematised in
Figure 63:

       The future time is also perceived as approaching ego by the speaker in the
1960s as in (943): (943-1)     Gamh.nziex      nqa’haav hingv            nyutc.zeiv         taux     daaih

           (ium_1966_03_PERMATON_ViggoSogaard_Gueix-Cing;00.00.28-33)       Spatial Relator Nouns
       Relator nouns are illustrated by Blake (2001:16) as “words like top in It stands
on top of the cupboard and front as in She is sitting in front of the house”. In some other
languages, the elements with the same concept are referred to as “locative-marked
nouns” or “locative particles” (for Chinese, Li and Thompson 1988:391ff). Iu Mien use
this class of nouns to specify a spatial relationship extensively rather than
prepositional phrases as Thai or English.
       There are two word orders in the spatial relator noun constructions. The one
is a postpositional relator noun construction, and the other, a prepositional relator
noun construction. To express the spatial relationship inside the house in English or
Thai we use the prepositional construction. Its counterpart in Iu Mien, however, uses
the opposite order, i.e., biaov ga’nyuuoz /pʲau˦˥˧ ka ɲuə˨˧˩/ [house inside]. In contrast,
the reverse order ga’nyuuoz biaov [inside house] means ‘around the general area of
inside toward the house’. Thus, the postpositional relator noun constructions and the
prepositional relator noun constructions differ in semantics. Confusion about the
distinction among the young Iu Mien is due to the fact that the latter kind of use is
absent in Thai even though the structure {inside}{house} (ข้างในบ้าน) has the same
appearance with the Iu Mien ga’nyuoz biauv /ka ɲuə˨˧˩ pʲau˦˥˧/ [inside house]. This
problem will be solved at the end of this section.","[737, 738, 739, 740]"

SVO pattern can occur, as it will be discussed in later chapters, they are in fact, in
terms of pragmatics, NPTOPIC–[Verb–NP]FOCUS. When the NPTOPIC is an A(gent), the second
NP in the FOCUS can most likely be a P(atient). The P(atient) argument NP is much
more naturally and frequently left-positioned as a TOPIC before the verb in a natural
conversational situation. The preposed P argument is often immediately followed by
a topic marker (i.e. lexical or prosodic), thus re-arrangement of them is an [NPTOP /8
NPAGENT–V] pattern, e.g., {rice}TOP / {I} {eat}, (the slash ‘/’ being a mark of left-
positioning or topicalisation). Thus Iu Mien is a topic prominent language.
         In a certain subgroup of clause (i.e. with the verbs of change of state or weather
verbs), the V–NP order (seemingly VS) order is observed, e.g., {fall} {rain}, as opposed
to other single argument clauses which is realised in the NP-V order, e.g., {bird} {fly}.
         Languages without morphological inflections often have versatile use of verbs
and this tendency is obvious in Iu Mien. Besides regular lexical meaning of verbs, a
certain class of verbs can function as words that indicate aspect, modality, and
directional movement. As a result, a sentence may contain a series of verbs, e.g.,
{modal verb} {main verb} {aspectual verb} {directional verb}. Tense is not indicated
in the verb but by adverbial phrases of time, typically placed after the topic and before
the main verb, e.g., {I} {tomorrow} {go} {to market}. Here again topicalisation of
time phrase is possible, e.g., {tomorrow} {I} {go} {to market}.
         It is also important to note that the real language is situated in discourse and
pragmatic contexts of life. In a connected discourse, be it monologue or
conversational, once the topic is established between the interlocutors, i.e.,
contextually accessible, a pronoun referring to it is most likely omitted; a THEME
argument retrievable from context also undergoes ellipsis. Thus Iu Mien is a context-
dependent language. It also heavily utilises varieties of sentence-final particles in
interlocution, indicating content question, polar question, self-question, aspects,
politeness or firmness, mild or strong command, urging, surprise, irritation, hearsay,
and doubt or certainty.","[39, 40]"

9.3.1 Temporal Adverbial Phrases
         The temporal adverbial constructions occur in three possible positions in the
sentence. The first two types are found in the indicative or declarative sentence, and
the third one in the presentative/existential construction containing the verb maaih
/mɑːj˧˩/ ‘there was, have’ typically used at the beginning of a narrative account
referring to a past event but not restricted to that genre. These three are:
         (i)      TOPIC(AGENT) – TemporalAdverbialNoun (AdvTEMP) – VP – NP(TH)
                  Var: TOP(A) – TemporalAdverbialPhrase (AdvPTEMP) – VP – NP(TH)
         (ii)     [AdvTEMP/AdvPTEMP]TOP – TOP(A) – VP – NP(TH)
         (iii)    AdvTEMP/AdvPTEMP – maaih – NP(TOP/EVENT)
9.3.1.1 The temporal adverbials in the second position in the
sentence
         Tense of a sentence is expressed by time nouns that function as temporal
adverbials or adverbial phrases, not by verbal inflections as some other languages. A
default word order with the temporal adverbial phrase in the second position after the
topic/actor in a sentence is indicated by Cox (1967:45) as

     Weic.zuqc CL1, CL2 (=main clause). ‘Because CL1, CL2.’
In this order both the reason clause and the main clause receive some kind of special
focus. For this reason [CL2]MAIN also has the conjunction cingx.daaih ‘therefore’:
     Weic.zuqc CL1, cingx.daaih CL2 [because CL1, therefore CL2] ‘Because CL1, therefore

          A variation of weic zuqc, the Chinese-loan yien weic /jen˦ wei˩/ ‘because’ (<

18.3.6 Post-pendent Clauses That Are Marked Both Clause-
initially and Clause-finally
          A manner (e.g. like…) and comparison with something (e.g. as…, as if…) are
expressed in the construction as follows:     CL1, hnangv CL2 wuov nor. [CL1]MAIN – [as.if CL2 like.that]SUB ‘CL1, as if CL2’Naming it as a “simile clause”, we will investigate how the principle of iconicity is at
work in the order of {main clause}{subordinate clause}. The construction [hnangv CL2
wuov nor] or the post-pendent simile clause conveys information which is quoted from
shared knowledge between the interlocutors or from socially/culturally shared
memory or commonly observed norm. Note that the obvious and visible event is
uttered first followed by a reference to the shared knowledge in (1024-1-3):    (1024-1)   Ov!        [aa          die           nyei     m’zing         hlo      daic]CLMAIN

       Note again the iconicity of the “visible first” and “quotation of shared
knowledge later”. The conspicuousness of the father’s enlarged eyes is intuitive to the
son, accordingly uttered immediately. The obviousness invited a comparison with the
shared knowledge (only between the father and son, hidden from the public eyes of a
village). (The son’s innocent reaction to father’s enlarged eyes exposed the hidden,
invisible information to the whole villagers.)
18.3.7 Summary of Hypotaxis
       In the case of pre-pendent clauses, i.e.,
 Causal clause:       [laaix-CL1]SUB           ‘due to the fact that’
 Concessive clause: [maiv.gunv-CL1]SUB         ‘although’
 Temporal clause: [CL -nyei.ziangh.hoc]SUB ‘at the time’
                               1
 Temporal clause: [CL1-wuov.zanc]SUB           ‘when’
 Temporal clause: [NP-yietv- CL ]SUB   1
                                                ‘as soon as’
 Consecutive clause: [V-gau-CL1]SUB            ‘V and then’
 Conditional clause: [se.gorngv-CL -nor]SUB ‘if’,
                                         1
the principle of Topic-Focus (right-ward focus) governs the sentence structure (as
according to the first and second principle, §4.2.1).
       On the other hand, in the cases of post-pendent clauses, i.e.,
 Purpose clause: [weic-CL2]SUB ‘in order that , so that’
 Reason clause: [weic.zuqc-CL2]SUB ‘because’
 Simile clause: [hnangv-CL2-(wuov) nor]SUB ‘like, as if’,
the principle of iconicity (i.e. concrete information first, abstract information
afterward) is at work. The summary of these points are in Figure 68:

Two major principles governing the order of hypotaxis                       (Figure from Arisawa 2015, SEALS25)       Complementation
       Noonan (2007:52) defines a sentential complementation as “the syntactic
situation that arises when a notional sentence or predication is an argument of a
predicate”. He further distinguishes “subject complements” (i.e. clauses which act as
sentential subject) and “object complements” (i.e. clauses which act as objects of
predicates). In this section object complements are discussed. As for the complements
that act as topics, they have been discussed in Chapter 10, where a clause is treated
as a topic in many cases.
       The “complement-taking predicates” (CTPs) (Noonan 2007:53) in Iu Mien
include gorngv ‘to say’, buatc ‘to see’, hnamv daaih ‘to think’, hiuv duqv ‘to know’, jangx
duqv ‘(can) remember’, jangx zuqc ‘to recall’, sienx ‘to believe’, mbuox ‘to tell’, ga’laaic
‘to assume’, cai ‘to guess’, and others.
       The majority of the CTPs in Iu Mien do not require a complement marker like
English that in I think that… or Thai wâa in khít wâa (คิดว่า) ‘think that…’. Only a small
class of modal verbs serve as complement markers, namely, daaih ‘to come’, taux ‘to
reach’, duqv ‘to get’, zuqc ‘to touch’ and in the following phrases:
   hnamv daaih [love COME] ‘to think that’
   hnamv taux [love reach] ‘to think about’
   hiuv duqv [know GET] ‘to know that’
   jangx zuqc [remember TOUCH] ‘to recall’                                            771
These compounds of [V + VMODAL] are not discussed here because they were
investigated in §6.7.4.9.
          In the following section, it will be demonstrated that all object-taking
complement constructions do not have a complement marker except for one. The only
situation in which a complement marker is used is with the utterance verbs in the
following construction containing gorngv ‘to say’ as a complement marker:
     naaic {person} gorngv [ask person say] ‘to ask {person} if…’
     heuc {person} gorngv [call person say] ‘to call {person} that…’
     mbuox {person} gorngv [tell person say] ‘to tell {person} that…’
     baaux {song} gorngv [sing song say]         ‘to sing a song saying that…’
The first constituent of each construction is termed as utterance verbs, used in Givón
(2001:155, 165, 309, 319 etc.) as a part of “perception-cognition-utterance verbs” or
PCU verbs, in the sense they are the verbs that are related to speech event or verbal
activity (oral or written).
18.4.1 gorngv ‘say that’
          Observe the verb gorngv ‘say that…’ directly takes the complement clause as
in (1025-1-2):    (1025-1)     Ninh    mbuo   gorngv
                 นิ่น    บัว    ก๊ อง

18.4.2 say-Complement-Taking Predicates: gorngv ‘saying
that…’
       If the complement-taking verbs belong to a semantic domain of a speech event
or verbal activity (oral or written), namely speech verbs, the verb gorngv ‘to say’
precedes the complement. The speech verb naaic ‘to ask’ is complemented by gorngv
followed by a direct question as in (1026-1-4): (1026-1) Yie        haiz           nv            nyei      die               mbuo      naaic           ninh    mbuo

"Having said that, Court himself recognises general rules about two classes of
adjectives: (a) “the prepositive-adjective pattern” (1986:127-8) is an established order
with regard to Chinese-derived adjectives and (b) “[t]he ‘aft-’ adjective is the norm”
(1986:129), namely, the pattern [NHDTS·VADJ] is the usual order with regard to non-
Chinese derived adjectives, i.e., the native Iu Mien adjectival verbs.
        However, a question arises when this variability is found within the Chinese-
loan adjectives. Such examples are shown by Purnell (2012:669) as variants (Var.) as
in (287) and (288):
(287) siem-koiv         ‘deep sea’.      Var: koiv siem
(288) siem-suiv         ‘deep water’. Var: suiv siem
                                             350
The compound siem-koiv, having the structure [AdjTS·NHD], is from shēn (深) ‘deep’ and
hǎi (海) ‘sea’ and both are Chinese origin. In the same way the compound siem-suiv is
from shēn (深) ‘deep’ and shuǐ (水) ‘water’. In each example the Chinese order (i.e.
[AdjTS·NHD]) exhibits tone sandhi on the first constituent whereas the Iu Mien order
(i.e. [NHD·Adj]) is not subject to tone sandhi: koiv siem [sea deep] and suiv siem [water
deep].
         To such variability of Chinese-loan adjectives we propose the following
rationale in terms of speaker’s age: namely, the older speakers who know Chinese
origin of particular adjectives, on the one hand, use the prepositive order and use the
native Iu Mien adjectival verbs postpositively. The younger speakers who are
unfamiliar with Chinese, on the other hand, tend to use all adjectives (including
Chinese-loan and native Iu Mien) in the postpositive order. Also, we suggest three
stages in which a certain group of Chinese-loan adjectives fully become Iu Mien
adjectival verbs. Evidence indicating them are presented as follows.
         Firstly, the use of the prepositive order of the Chinese-loan adjectives is clearly
distinguished from the use of the postpositive order in the native Iu Mien adjectival
verbs among the older speakers, who usually know Chinese. The evidence has been
amply shown in the previous sections: e.g., loz-hnoi ‘old days’ in (1-17), (4-1), (160-5) or
Loz-Zanh ‘the Old Zan clan’ in (161-1), where the Chinese-loan adjective loz- modifies
a noun prepositively with tone sandhi, i.e., [AdjTS·NHD], as opposed to, e.g., nyaam-hlo
‘big (principal) daughter-in-law’ in (185) and ong-gox ‘an old grandpa’ in (275a),
where the postpositive order with tone sandhi, i.e., [NHDTS·VADJ], is employed.
         Regarding the age factor, see the explanation by a member of the older
generation in (289-1-4): (289-1)    “yangh     ngongh”       se      dongh

That is, yangh ngongh [yellow cow] ‘yellow cow’ is by the older generation, ngongh
yangh [cow yellow] ‘yellow cow’ by the younger generation.
           Concerning the postpositive siem ‘deep’ found in the variants, koiv siem ‘deep
sea’ (287) and suiv siem ‘deep water’ (288), presented by Purnell (2012:669), as
opposed to the standard prepositive order in siem-koiv and siem-suiv, one of our Iu
Mien language consultants (Zanh Gueix-Cing)142 explained that they da’gangx mi’aqv
[reverse TELIC] ‘they are reversed’, that is, non-standard in Chiang Rai dialect. He
further pointed out that these two compounds occurring in the prepositive-adjective
pattern are the nzung nyei waac [song SBCP word] ‘the song language’, namely,
Purnell’s (1991:373) “literary language” (cf. §2.4.4). As such, together with the
consultant’s rejection of the postpositive order, the morpheme siem ‘deep’ should be
confirmed to be purely of Chinese origin and thus should be situated at the first stage,
at least in the Chiang Rai variety of Iu Mien. Unfortunately, no explanation is available
at the moment regarding the absence of tone sandhi in the variants, koiv siem and suiv
siem. Perhaps, they are in the American variety of Iu Mien.
           The second stage is a situation where a Chinese-loan adjective cannot be used
postpositively in a nominal compound but can be used predicatively in a clause. In
other words, out of the four criteria summarised above (§6.5.2.1), the phenomenon
concedes (i)(which says “it precedes the head noun”) and (iv)(“it (almost always)
undergoes tone sandhi in forming a nominal compound”) but contradicts (ii)(“it
cannot occur predicatively”) and (iii)(“it cannot take aspectual verbs nor a
comparative particle nor can be intensified”). An example of this behaviour can be
found in siang (<san1 in Cantonese, xīn in Mandarin, both written as 新) as has been142

observe in (1017) that the semantic relationship between the [CL1 gau] and CL2 is
simply a transition from one conceptual event to another despite the syntactic

            quoted in Arisawa (2006:57, 295))
       The conceptual event of {I cook rice} is followed by the conceptual event of
{fire singed all my hair}. Gau is used to show this order of transition between two
events in a passage of time. The syntactic dependency of gau-clause on the main clause
does not mean that the latter conveys a more important message than the former.
Rather, the whole sentence describes that the two events happened in this order.
       Though it is apparent that the clause containing gau functions as a temporal
sequential prependent clause, an attention may be drawn to the NP hnaangx ‘rice’,
which is seemingly dislocated or detached from the verb zouv ‘to cook’. This very
position of gau again may be a piece of evidence that the constituent order “so-called
SVO” is not grammaticalised in Iu Mien. It should be recalled that this loose verb-
medial order is an entailment of Principle 3: “Iu Mien is a verb-medial language in
which the positions of Topic (possibly realised as AGENT) and Focus (possibly
containing THEME) are pragmatically assigned. Even though a sentence in which Topic
is realised as A and Focus containing TH has an appearance “SVO”, the word order is
not necessarily grammaticalised” (§4.2.1).
       The temporal sequential subordinate clause so far exhibits the structure [NP1
V gau NP2], as labelled as the clause-medially marked prependent clause. In other
cases, a simpler clause can be used: V-gau as in (1018):

        SENTENCES COMPRISING LINKED CLAUSES      Introduction
       In this chapter, four kinds of clause linking relations are discussed. They are
juxtaposition, coordination (i.e. parataxis), subordination (i.e. hypotaxis), and
complementation (i.e. embedded clauses as a direct object of certain verbs).
       Longacre’s (2007:372-420) account that sentences are “combinations of
clauses” applies to Iu Mien. Sentences in Iu Mien comprise various types of clauses in
the above mentioned three relations (i.e. coordination, subordination, and
complementation) and these combinations are bound or grounded by optional SFPs.
These four relations are schematised as:
       Juxtaposition and coordination are categorised in the parataxis, which are
quite straightforward.
       Hypotaxis operates on two different principles in regard to the order of
subordinate clause and main clause: one is the principle of topic and focus, the other,
the principle of iconicity. Except the variant sentence pattern (i.e. the main clause
placed at the sentence-initial position), here again the overall structure of margin-
nucleus (i.e. the margin is on the left, nucleus the right) is evident. That is, the
subordinate clause always occurs first (i.e. on the left) followed by the main clause
(on the right). This works on the basis of the topic-focus order. Three exceptions to
this order, however, are the cases of the purpose clause, the reason clause, and the
simile clause, which often occur at the end of the sentence. The fact that the
subordinate clauses occurring sentence-finally, i.e., in the focal point, seemingly
violates the principle of the right-ward focus structure (as a part of the second
principle or RMF, viz., right-ward multilayered focus structure. See §4.2.1). The
rationale to these phenomena will be given based on iconicity: a concrete event is
stated in a main clause which is stated first in the sentence, i.e., occurring sentence-
initially or on the left; an abstract, additional information (purpose, reason, and                                           736
simile) follows that, being located sentence-finally. The speaker who observes a
concrete event states it in the first position of the sentence, then adds supplement
information at the end of the sentence. This order is intuitive, immediate to the actual
event happening in front of the speaker’s eyes, hence, iconic.
            Complementation is argued in a simple way of presenting various examples of
verbs that take a clause as a direct object. The main point in this presentation is that
these verbs do not take a complementiser. Iu Mien does not mark the beginning of
complement clause typically among the old generation speakers, in contrast to such a
particle as that in English (e.g. I believe that he is coming to see us.).","[771, 772, 773]"

     WORKING PRINCIPLES OF THE GRAMMAR AND
             LEXICAL GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES     Introduction
       Having coming through the background and the phonology in Chapters 2 and
3, this chapter will present a broad framework for the grammar in three areas, that is,
typological synopsis in terms of seven operational principles (§4.2), a pragmatic
orientation in determining argument structures (§4.3) and “parts of speech” (§4.4).
       First, typologically Iu Mien is perceived as topic-prominent language, rather
than an SVO language even though this word order does occur in it. This topic
orientation feature is realised in the constituent order that topic-on-the-left and
comment-on-the-right in a sentence. The first part of this chapter lays out the most
common sentence structure of the language as a general framework of analyses, which
will steer the course of all discussions for the rest of this grammar.
       Because of reference to older works on “topic and comment” (e.g. Li and
Thompson (1976) and Fuller (1985) for Hmong) from a more or less historical
perspective on various theories which dealt with the issue in the course of laying a
foundation for this grammar, the terms “comment” and “focus” are used
interchangeably. Once the foundation is established, however, the term “focus” will
be continuously used following Lambrecht (1994) from Chapter 5 onward.
       The second section addresses the issue of NP roles in relation to a predicate
verb. In other words, this section is about argument structures. The gist of the
discussion is that pragmatics, rather than syntax or semantics, determines the
semantic roles of argument NPs. The section prepares the readers for further
discussions presented in §11.2 and §15.3.2.
       The purpose of the third part of this chapter is to identify the fundamental
elements that constitute the language. As their details will be discussed in Chapters 5
onwards, Chapter 4 presents limited number of language examples just to illustrate
“parts of speech” or grammatical categories.","[238, 239]"

4.2.2 The Principle of General-to-Particular as a Hypernym of
Topic-Focus
       The First Principle, i.e., the basicness of the Topic-Focus structure, is discussed
here. In order to elucidate it, a comprehensive principle of general-to-particular in
human cognitive ability is discussed drawing on some literatures. An overall claim is
laid out in this section that the conceptual structure of “ground and figure”, the term
taken from Cognitive Linguistics, is capable of explaining large number of
grammatical constructions of Iu Mien including noun phrases, relative clauses, coverb
phrase constructions, clause and sentence structure, and the use of SFPs.
       The term “ground and figure” can be understood in other terms such as “theme
and rheme”, “topic and focus”, “generic and particular”, “margin and nucleus” and
“broad and specific” to borrow from various schools of linguistics. And at this
introductory stage, it is roughly correct to say that majority of constituent order in Iu
Mien follow the order of “from theme to rheme”, “from topic to focus”, “from general
to particular”, “from margin to nucleus” and “from broad to specific”. In other words,
the construction that is in the state of ground, theme, topic, general, margin, broad,
occurs on the left side of a sentence, i.e., sentence-initially. On the other hand, the
construction that is in the state of figure, rheme, focus, particular, nucleus, specific,
appears on the right side, i.e., sentence-finally. Schematically expressed in Figure 46:
                                   Left                    Right
                           general                particular
                           theme                  rheme
                           topic                  comment/focus
                           margin                 nucleus
                           ground                 figure
                           broad                  specific
                           whole                  part
             Figure 46. The order of two main elements in sentence.","[241, 242]"
"
       Additionally the following three roles after Comrie (2001:134) are also used:
   A(gent) = “subject” of transitive verbs (from a Eurocentric perspective), or
    semantically, a volitional causer of an action, often animate.
   P = “object” of transitive verbs (semantically corresponds to THEME mentioned
    above)
   Sb = “subject” of intransitive verbs (‘Sb’ to be distinguished from ‘S’(ource))4.3.2 NP Roles of Arguments are Determined by Pragmatics
Based on a Combination of Principle 1 and Principle 2
       The NP roles listed in the previous section (§4.3.1) are determined by
pragmatics based on a combination of Principle 1 and Principle 2. The first principle
reads as follows:         Principle 1. A basic sentence pattern of Iu Mien has two parts of Topic and
         Focus.",[270]
"
                       Figure 52. Prosodic gap as a topic marker         Further, the focus jangx duqv [remember can] ‘(I) can remember’ is followed
by the grounding element, that is, the stative aspectual particle nyei. Though in some
cases it is possible to finish a sentence without the sentence final particle, such a
sentence is rather uncomfortable in the minds of interlocutors as if it was an abstract,
artificial, fragmental utterance. With the presence of nyei, the listeners are sure that
the utterance is complete. Thus a group of sentence final particles are proposed here
as the grounding elements, which will be discussed in Chapter 19.
         Next example has the same structure but with a pending marker aeqv, which
functions as a topic marker as (151-1-2):
                                                 228

              (ium_2000_01_Cst_IB_FuqcHin_CrssMg2Th&Hist;00.01.24-28)
       A pragmatically context-configured, very natural utterance in an actual speech
event is exemplified in (152): (152) Ga’naaiv /                hietv      nqa’haav             nqaang         saah¿
           กะน้าย/               เฮยี้ยด ฆะฮ้า                   ฆาง            ซ่าะ¿

           thing         put    back          rear        Q
           ‘(You want me to) load (your) stuff in the rear part (of the truck), don’t you?’
           (MZ, attested 20140325, Maechan)
Obviously ga’naaiv ‘things’ are not an AGENT of putting but a THEME placed in a position
of topic. Conversely it would be unnatural to say: yie hietv ga’naaiv nqa’haav nqaang
saah¿ [1SG put thing back rear Q] ‘I should load (your) stuff in the rear part (of the
truck), shouldn’t I?’ even though the constituent order fits the SVO pattern.
       Furthermore, to say that Iu Mien is an SVO language cannot explain a clause
like (153a) while Thai, a language spoken in the vicinity of Iu Mien, shows the
opposite word order as in (153b): (153a) duih mbiungc
 ium        ตุย้     บยูง่
            tui˧˩    bʲuŋ˩
            fall rain
            ‘It is raining/it rains.’
It might be correct to say that Thai is an SV(O) language since we find the next
example (153b) to describe the same situation as (153a) in Iu Mien:                                                            229
 (153b) fǒn      tòk
 Thai     ฝน     ตก
          rain fall
          ‘It is raining/it rains.’
        So then, how should we describe Iu Mien? LaPolla and Poa (2006) argue:         Each language is a unique set of language-specific conventions, and so each
         language should be described in its own terms (LaPolla 2003). That is, when
         describing a language, we should not assume that there are universal
         categories of grammatical relations, and that word order in all languages
         can be explained using them, for example making statements such as “X is
         an SOV language”; we should describe for each language the principles that
         determine the word order patterns found in that language (LaPolla and Poa
         2006:270).","[264, 265, 266]"

      Basic Working Principles of the Grammar4.2.1 Seven Principles
         This grammar is founded on the seven working principles, which are by and
large found in many languages of Southeast Asia, as outlined as follows:
Principle 1. A basic sentence pattern of Iu Mien has two parts of Topic and Focus.
Principle 2. Iu Mien has a rightward99 multilayered focus (RMF) structure. The more
                 rightward a constituent goes (i.e. toward the end of a sentence), the
                 more focus it gets.
Principle 3. Iu Mien is a verb-medial language in which the positions of Topic
                 (possibly realised as AGENT) and Focus (possibly containing THEME) are
                 pragmatically assigned. Even though a sentence in which Topic is
                 realised as A and Focus containing TH has an appearance “SVO”, the
                 word order is not necessarily grammaticalised.
Principle 4. Iu Mien is a verb-versatility language, which utilises verbs for aspect and
                 modality, multi-verb constructions (MVCs) including serial verb
                 constructions (SVCs), and preposition-like (i.e. oblique) coverb phrases
                 (CvPs).
Principle 5. A vague distinction between “parts-of-speech” is normal. A Noun-Verb
                 distinction is flexible on the part of verbs in Iu Mien. A verb, an
                 adjectival verb or even a clause can be treated as one (big) noun.
Principle 6. Sentence final particles (SFPs) semantically and pragmatically play
                 multiple roles, and function as grounding elements though optional.
Principle 7. The argument structure in Iu Mien, or the relationship between verbs
                 and NPs in a sentence, is aligned by pragmatics, specifically by the
                 verb’s rich cultural semantic frame. That is, cultural knowledge around
                 the event or situation the verb designates determines what should be
                 treated as core arguments.","[239, 240]"

           Mengh_NaaivZouxMvGaenghZiangx;00.00.29-31)
If the topic, i.e. the demonstrative pronoun naaiv ‘this’, is placed back in the position
of the object argument, the sentence would be Ninh mbuo zoux naaiv mv gaengh ziangx
[3PL make this NEG yet PF]. Though such a sentence is grammatically well-formed, it
is rare and unnatural that it is not used in a normal situation. This also shows the
“basicness of topic-comment sentences” (Li and Thompson 1976:471) in Iu Mien.
         Therefore, the basic constituent order at the sentence level in Iu Mien is as
follows:
St = ±Vocative +Topic ±SentenceMedial +FocusClause ±GroundingElement,
in which the Topic and Focus are obligatory (+) whereas the Sentence-initial
vocative, the Sentence-Medial Element (i.e. copula), and the Grounding Element are
optional (±).",[263]

             VERBS AND ARGUMENT STRUCTURE        Introduction
        The main theme of this chapter is the argument structure. Two important
sections are (i) the structures with one-, two-, and three-argument (§11.2), and (ii)
the issue of the seemingly post-verbal subject, which has the order V-NP (§11.3 and
§11.4). Admittedly the former category needs further research (e.g. distinction
between obvious transitive verbs and ambitransitive verbs in two-argument
structures, and change of ditransitive (three-argument) structures to coverb-
containing clauses), but a main purpose of this chapter is limited to present basic
forms of each construction. The latter construction will be analysed in terms of the
entity-presentative constructions (§11.3.1) and the event-presentative constructions
(§11.3.2). The construction [V-NP] encodes natural (meteorological) happening,
unexpected emergence/appearance, and inexorability (§11.4). On the other hand, the
construction [NP-V] encodes volitional agent.
         Prior to these analyses, the tests for verbhood will be surveyed.","[610, 611]"

4.2.3.6 The order ‘from Topic-on-the-left to Comment-on-the-
right’
         The sixth illustration is the order of Topic and Comment (Focus). Topic comes
first at the left-most end, Comment on the right-most end in the sentence. Regarding
the function of Topic. Court (1986) writes:             A topic may represent the agent or an event or the subject of an adjective,
             or the general setting or scene of an event or state of affairs—time, place
             and so on—and may take the form of a clause, or a VP (Court 1986:29-30.
             Italics added).","[249, 250]"

6.7.4.3 Psycho-collocation 1: [V·N]CMPD
         Psycho-collocation compound verbs occur with a limited number of body part
terms. In Mien hnyouv /ɲ̊ʲəʊ˦˥˧/ ‘heart’, its Chinese-loan counter-part fim /fim˦/ ‘heart’,
daamv /taːm˦˥˧/ ‘gall bladder’, and qiex /cʰiə˨˧/ ‘breath’, a Chinese-loan mueic /mʷeic˩/
‘eye’, are found to be used in this construction.
         An example of psycho-collocation compound verb has the structure [V·N]CMPD,
where the N is a ‘heart’ as in (448)(a repetition of (237): (448)       bieqc.hnyouv
             เปี ยะ เฮญี้ยว
             piəʔ˩ ɲ̊ʲəʊ˦˥˧
             enter.heart
             ‘understand’
             (ium_20150429_01_H1_DA_WK-FH_Metalanguage;00.03.57)
         The same expression bieqc.hnyouv can take complement (object) and the
combination as a whole is preceded by a negative particle maiv, not inserted, as in
(449): (449)     Yie        maiv     bieqc.hnyouv      meih.
           เยีย       ไม้      เปี ยะ เฮญีย้ ว   เม่ย.
           iə˦        mai˦˥˧   piəʔ˩ ɲ̊ʲəʊ˦˥˧    mei˧˩
           1SG NEG          enter.heart 2 SG
           ‘I don’t understand you.’
           (ium_20150511_01_H1_DA_GF_LangSession_KMB;01.11.20-3)
Bieqc.hnyouv could be a calque from Thai khâu cai [enter heart] (เข้าใจ) ‘to understand,
know’. Panh (2002:13), who originally came from Laos, recording his dialect spoken
in Laos and US, defines bieqc.hnyouv as ‘to know, to understand.’
         Other examples of [V·N]CMPD are:
(450) bungx.hnyouv /puŋ˨˧ ɲ̊əʊ˦˥˧/
         [release.heart]
         ‘to trust’ (the compound functions as a transitive verb)
(451) dingc.hnyouv /tiŋ˩ ɲ̊əʊ˦˥˧/
         [fix.heart]
         ‘to decide’ (the compound functions as an intransitive verb)                                                 409
6.7.4.4 Psycho-collocation 2: [VADJ·N]CMPD
            In the psycho-collocation [VADJ·N]CMPD, the N can be an Iu Mien original hnyouv
/ɲ̊əʊ˦˥˧/ or Chinese-loan fiem /fʲəm˦/ ‘heart’, or its variant fim /fim˦/ ‘core’ (cf. §6.6.2).
However, the Chinese-loan fiem or fim cannot be used in [V·N]CMPD of §6.7.4.3.
            A ‘small heart(core)’ means ‘to be careful, vigilant, prudent’ as in (452): (452)          Mingh        aeqv,         aqv.zuqc146   faix.fim.
                มี่ง         แอ๊ะ,         อ๊ะ.หฒุ       ไฝ.ฟิ ม.
                miŋ˧˩        ɛʔ˥           aʔ˥ tsuʔ˩     fai˨˧ fim˦
                go        PDP    must           [be.small].core
                ‘When you go, you must take care.’
                (Faam Baeqv Aengh Doih [A Story of Faam-Bae and Aeng-Doi], Arisawa
                (2006:70))
            This order in [VADJ·N]CMPD refers to a temporal condition whereas the reverse
order [N·VADJ]CMPD describes a more permanent state of the heart. Contrast (453-1-2) with
(454-1-3): (453-1)        “Yie         kouv.hnyouv.”
                “เยีย        โค้ ว.เฮญีย้ ว.”
                 iə˦         kʰəʊ˦˥˧ ɲ̊əʊ˦˥˧
                 1SG      [be.tired].heart
                ‘I am so distressed.’
                (ium_20150511_01_H1_DA_GF_LangSession_KMB;01.13.34-5)
 (453-2)        hnamv        maiv          tong          haiv.nyungc.
                ฮนั้ม        ไม้           ทง            ไฮ้.หญู่ง.
                n̥am˦˥˧      mai˦˥˧        tʰoŋ˦         hai˦˥˧ ɲuŋ˩
                think     NEG       go.through    anything
                ‘(you) can’t think through anything (because you are so emotionally tired).’
                (ium_20150511_01_H1_DA_GF_LangSession_KMB;01.14.21-2)
            Negation of (453-1) is Yie maiv kouv.hnyouv, meaning that ‘I can manage by
thinking through because the situation is not too difficult for me’.
            Conversely, the order [N·VADJ] means illness as explained in (454-1-3):
146
      Aqv.zuqc is a variant of oix.zuqc ‘must’.","[444, 445, 446]"
"
4.4.1 Coexistence of “Parts-of-Speech” and Principle 5
       In relation to Principle 5 (cf. §4.2.1), which is about the vague distinction
between “parts-of-speech”, the following four points should be noted. First, as it is a
working principle, rather than something like a mathematical axiom, it does not
necessarily exclude the use of traditional terms of grammatical categories. Following
a customary practice demonstrated in Court (1986), Purnell (2012), and Thanyalak
Saeliao (2012), we also employ them as a useful metalanguage to carry on our
discussion. Hence, Table 27 and the subsequent descriptions are presented. Second,
on the one hand, the traditional “parts-of-speech” are still unambiguous, especially
with regard to prototypical nouns (e.g. buoz ‘hand’, m’nqorngv ‘head’, zaux ‘foot, leg’,
etc.) and prototypical verbs (e.g. nyanc ‘to eat’, yangh ‘to walk’, mborqv ‘to hit’, etc.).
Third, on the other hand, the principle addresses situations where a categorical
classification of “parts-of-speech” do not seem to be true to a reality of the language.
The “parts-of-speech” cannot be determined unless they occur in an actual usage
event. This may also be illustrated regarding English in such derivations as The plane
was heading north from a head (noun), Please hand this memo to your colleagues from a
hand (noun), or He just mouthed empty slogans from a mouth (noun). Fourth, in contrast
to these examples in English, the fuzziness of “parts-of-speech” in Iu Mien can be
found in verbs rather than in nouns: nyanc hopv [eat drink] ‘food’ (noun) from nyanc
                                           239
‘to eat’ and hopv ‘to drink’. No evidence of nouns being used as verbs has been found.
Therefore, Principle 5 on the vague distinction between “parts-of-speech” and the use
of such traditional terms do not contradict each other.
       Different terms referring to more or less the same notion have been proposed:
for example, “parts of speech” first used in Latin and Greek grammars, discussed in
detail by Jespersen (1924:58-101) and by Schachter and Shopen (2007:1-60),
“radicals and grammatical elements” by Sapir (1921), “word classes” used by
Bloomfield (1933) almost interchangeably with “parts of speech”, also by Robins
(1980:171-5), “syntactic categories” by Croft (1991) from typological and cognitive
linguistics perspectives, “grammatical categories” by T. E. Payne (1997:32-70) from
descriptive-functional-cognitive viewpoint and Taylor (2003:270-4) who subsumes in
this term both “parts of speech” and syntactic categories from cognitive linguistics,
and “lexical categories” by Baker (2003) in generative syntax framework.
       In this study the term “grammatical categories” is used in Payne’s sense more
or less as synonyms of “parts of speech” and “word classes” but reflecting original
sense of partes orationis ‘parts of the sentence’ in Latin. That is, as Matthews
(2007:289) explains, “[a] ‘part’ was thus an element of syntax necessarily or
potentially related to other ‘parts’ (noun to verb, adverb to verb, preposition to noun,
and so on)”.
       What is common among different scholars quoted above, both those who
worked mostly in European languages and those who work in the domain of cross-
linguistic and typological study, is that they recognise the categories like noun, verb,
adjective, adverb, can cut across their boundaries and that they differ from language
to language. For example, most languages of Southeast Asia have noun classifiers,
which is absent from the earlier Eurocentric authors. For Iu Mien, a comparison of
three authors’ approaches to grammatical categories is shown in Table 27:

Common minimal items among the three authors number up to nine: numerals,
classifiers, nouns, verbs, adverbs, conjunctions, particles, interjections, and
prepositions. Nouns, verbs, adverbs are in an open class; the others, a closed class.
         Attention has to be drawn to Court’s (1986) treatment of adjectives, which is
not shown in Table 27 in contrast to other two authors. He classifies them as a
subcategory of verbs while Purnell and Thanyalak Saeliao treat them separately. It is
true that propensity among Southeast Asian languages is that adjectives behave like
verbs as is the case with Iu Mien. Nevertheless, it has been also found that certain
syntactical tests differentiate the adjectival verbs and the adjectives that do not show
verb-like behaviour. This will be discussed in §6.5.2 and §7.2.
         Maximal categories in Purnell will be presented in the following pages.103

   It does not have any significance to discuss in the strict order of open class and closed class because
once finished discussing nouns, which is an open class, one should naturally goes on to other related
categories such as classifiers, personal and demonstrative pronouns, which are all closed classes.","[275, 276, 277]"

       It can explain:
   The structure of Iu Mien names (as has been illustrated in (137), §4.2.3.1)
   Oblique coverb phrase – main verb (as has been illustrated in (138), §4.2.3.3)
   Adversative passive construction (as a subcategory of oblique coverb phrase,
    §17.6)
   Genitive/possessive construction (as in (139) and (140), §4.2.3.4)
   Subordinate clause – main clause (as in (141-1-3), §4.2.3.5)
   Topic-Focus(Comment) structure (as in Figure 48, §4.2.3.6)
   The guise of Verb-Subject order (§11.4)4.2.5 Utterances, Sentences, and Words
       This section has to do with Principle 6: Sentence final particles (SFPs)
semantically and pragmatically play multiple roles, and function as grounding
elements though optional. The gist of the section is that a sentence is optionally
marked by an SFP. That is, it is safe to consider that if a hearer recognises an SFP,
then the sentence is complete.
       It is useful to make a distinction between utterances and sentences. An
utterance is “[a]nything spoken on a specific occasion” (Matthews 2007:424). An
utterance may be smaller or larger than, or identical with the length of a sentence.
Court (1986:23) is right in recognising “the chain of speech in [Iu] Mien as being
broken into utterances, of various functions, and structurally consisting of either
sentences or fragments”. He defines the utterance and the sentence as applied to Iu
Mien as follows:         The utterance: The utterance is a stretch of meaningful speech that
         conforms to the rules of [Iu] Mien grammar as we shall here describe them
         (Court 1986:23).","[256, 257]"

6.5.2.1 A Chinese-loan adjective prepositively modifies the head
noun
        First, the nominal compound [AdjTS·NHD] is composed of [Adj (Ch.) – tone
sandhi – NHD]. The examples of this type have been seen in the prepositive Chinese-
loan adjective loz /lo˨˧˩/ ‘old’ in Loz-Bien ‘Old Bien (clan)’ in Table 34 in §5.3.2.1, and
Table 36 in §5.3.2.2. Its Chinses cognate lauv ‘old’ is explained by Tan (1986) in
§5.3.4.1. Generally the Chinese-loan adjectives only precede attributively the head
nouns, and are not used as predicate. A few more examples are:
(267) Loz-Zanh          /lo˧˩ tsan˧˩/   ‘Old Zan clan’ ((161-1) in §5.3.2.2)
(268) loz-hnoi          /lo˧˩ n̥ɔi˦/    ‘old days’ ((160-5), also (1-17) in §2.2.2.5)
        Another example of prepositive adjective is domh /tom˧˩/ ‘big’:
(269) domh mienh        /tom˧˩ miən˧˩/ [big person]        ‘adult, parent’ ((164-3) in §5.3.3)
                                            344
(270) domh nauz            /tom˧˩ nau˨˧˩/                          ‘one’s mother-in-law’s older
                                                                   brother’ ((183-9) in §5.4.2.6)
(271) Domh Loz-Dangc /tom˧˩ lo˧˩ taŋ˩/                             ‘The Greater Old Dang (clan)’
                                                                   ((163-2), also in Table 34)
(272) domh nzangv /tom˧˩ dzaŋ˦˥˧/                                  ‘big boat’ ((1-16) in §2.2.2.5)
In examples (269) – (272), the Chinese-loan adjective domh has Tone 2 /˧˩/ indicated
by the word final tone mark –h according to the Unified Roman Script. Because this
tone /˧˩/ (or –h) coincides with the result of tone sandhi, a hyphen is not used
(according to the Unified Roman Script). That is to say, the underlying tone and the
result of tone sandhi as a mark of compound noun are the same in this case.
       The important characteristic of this construction is the order of the immediate
constituents, that is, the adjective precedes the head noun. This is the reverse order
to the majority order of Iu Mien adjectival verbs which follow the head noun in
specification or modification. See (273-1-2): (273-1)   [gorngv]        “siang-biauv”           duqv     nyei
           [ก๊อง]          “เซียง-เปย๊า”           ตุ๊      เญย

            [say]      new-house       can                  ASST
           ‘You can [say] a “new house”.’
 (273-2)   “Biauv-siang”          yaac      ganh           nyungc        mi’aqv.
           “เปย๊า-เซียง”          หย่า      กั้น           หญู่ง         หมี่ อ๊ะ.

            house-new         TOP    different kind       TELIC
           ‘(but if you say) a “house new”, it has become a different kind.’
           (ium_20150427_01_H1_DA_GF_LangSession_KMB;00.01.09-14)
The standard order in this construction is siang-biauv [AdjTS·NHD] ‘new house’ with tone
sandhi. The language consultant gives the phrase in the reverse order explaining it as
“different” kind, i.e., not correct. Therefore, immediately he goes on to say that the
latter order should be used in the predicate use as in (274):
                                                     345
 (274)      Nv           norm biauv          siang        haic   […]     siang          nyei.
            น้           นอม      เปย๊า      เซียง        ไห่    […]     เซียง          เญย
            n̩˦˥˧        nɔm˦ pʲau˦˥˧        sʲaŋ˦        hai˩           sʲaŋ˦          ɲei˦
            DEMPRX       CLF  house be.new very                 be.new ASST
            ‘This house is very new (or you should say) “it is new”.’
            (ium_20150427_01_H1_DA_GF_LangSession_KMB;00.01.19-20, 36-37)
The predicative adjectival verb siang can be followed by the adverb haic ‘very’ or by
the affirmative stative or assertive (ASST) aspect particle nyei.
         To confirm negatively that this construction is characterised by the [AdjTS·NHD]
order, see the fact that the Iu Mien adjectival verbs cannot precede the head noun as
explained by contrasting (275a) and (275b): (275a)     “ong-gox”                 yaac   gorngv       duqv   nyei.
            “อง-โก๋ ”                 หย่า   ก๊อง         ตุ๊    เญย.

            ‘(You) can’t (say) “old-grandpa”, it is not possible.’
            (ium_20150427_01_H1_DA_GF_LangSession_KMB;00.04.23-6)
         In contrast, to confirm positively the [AdjTS·NHD] order is the characteristic of
Chinese-loan adjectives, refer back to examples cited in Chapter 5 with loz ‘old’: Loz-
Bienh ‘Old Bien clan’, Loz-Bungz ‘Old Bung clan’, Loz-Dangc ‘Old Dang clan’ etc. in
Table 34 and (161-1), and loz-hnoi ‘old days) in (1-17) and (160-5).
         As exemplified in siang-biauv in (273-1), the first constituent of most [AdjTS·NHD]
compounds undergoes tone sandhi. However, some cases do not as in (276):
                                                    346
 (276)      Mbenc     ziangx kuv               lai         kuv             hnaangx
            เบ่น      เหฒียง    คู้            ไล          คู้             หฮนาง

            prepare PF         be.delicious vegetable be.delicious rice
            ‘(They) finished preparing a banquet.’ (lit. ‘delicious vegetables (e.g.
            various dishes including meat) and delicious rice (i.e. staple foods)’)
            (ium_c1965_01_BASF_HCox_UvHiaangEtAl_BagiYungh;00.05.03-05)
The combination of two compounds kuv.lai ‘delicious dishes’ and kuv.hnaangx
‘delicious foods’ comprises an alliteration with the pattern ABAC (i.e. A = kuv, B =
lai, and C = hnaangx, where B and C are near-synonymous). These elaborate
expressions will be investigated in detail in §20.5.2.
         When there is a Chinese-loan adjective, it is usually expected that one can find
an Iu Mien adjectival verb with the similar meaning as a counterpart. For example,
the Chinese loz /lo˨˧˩/ ‘old’ (inanimate) corresponds to the Iu Mien gox ‘to be old’
(animate), domh /tom˧˩/ ‘big’ (Chinese) to hlo /l ̥o˦/ ‘to be big’ (Iu Mien), and fiuv
/fiu˦˥˧/ ‘small’ (Chinese) to faix /fai˨˧/ ‘to be small’ (Iu Mien). Collocations using them
have certain constraints. For example, when a Chinese-loan adjective precedes the
head noun:
(277) domh nauz         ‘one’s mother-in-law’s brother’ (183-9),
                        but not *hlo-nauz nor *nauz-hlo nor *nauz-domh.
(278) fiuv-laangz       ‘a small village’,
                        but not *faix-laangz nor *laangz-fiuv. (laangz-faix is possible)
         One the other hand, an Iu Mien adjectival verb follows the head noun:
(279) nyaam-hlo         ‘big (principal) daughter-in-law’ (185),
                        but not *hlo-nyaam nor *domh-nyaam nor *nyaam-domh.
(280) ong-gox           ‘an old grandpa’,
                        but not *gox-ong nor *loz-ong nor *ong-loz.","[380, 381, 382, 383]"
"This distinction also, in Iu Mien, is arranged in the order that the ground on the left
side in the sentence, and the figure on the right side.
       To summarise and to repeat our main point in this chapter: the order of “from
the left to the right” is invariable. Take an example of the margin on the left, the
nucleus on the right, as in Se.gornv duih mbiungc nor, yie maiv mingh [if fall rain PART-                                             208
sub-clause, 1SG NEG go] ‘If it rains, I will not go’. In English the reverse order of the
clauses is possible, e.g., ‘I will not go, if it rains’. However, generally Iu Mien does not
allow the sentence end with the subordinate clause marking particle nor. That is, any
bound clause, i.e., a dependent clause, (manner adverbial clause, temporal adverbial
clause, etc.) usually come before the main clause.
         The principles of the ground-on-the-left and the figure-on-the-right work not
only at the sentence level but also other levels such as phrase, clause, and even the
order of expressing residential address. Since as many as the speaker wishes
subordinate clause can be added, two parts of the sentence, i.e., topic and focus, may
be laid over repeatedly. Thus, it should be termed as the rightward-multilayered focus
structure (RMF). Seven illustrations to support this claim will be presented in §4.2.3.","[244, 245]"

         In the previous section we have seen the entity-central presentative verb
maaih, in which the NP follows the verb. In the following example which shows the
same word order V-NP, it is an event that is presented. Thus, in contrast to the one in
the previous section, the construction in this section can be referred to as event-central
presentative word order or event-central presentative construction as discussed in
LaPolla and Poa (2006:9).

         It is true that (784-1) can be analysed as topic-focus order. However, see the
analysis of a similar Chinese clause by LaPolla and Poa (2006), (22b.4) qī suì shí sǐ-le
fùqīn [seven years.old time die-ASP father] ‘when he was seven his father died’ (ibid.
278) as follows:          The clause form in (22b.4) involves two parts, a topic and a comment [i.e.
          focus]. What seems to make this clause unusual is that the comment [i.e.
          focus] takes the form of an event-central presentative clause. Event-central
          presentative clauses assert the existence (happening) of an event. These
          clause do not have a two-part topic-comment [i.e. topic-focus] structure;
          they are thetic rather than categorical (LaPolla and Poa 2006:279).","[634, 635, 636]"

       In this grammar, we have argued for and established the following seven
operational principles that are working in the structure of Iu Mien language in such a
manner that they are interlaced:
   (1) topic-focus orientation,
   (2) multilayered focus structure with prominence on the sentence final position,
   (3) verb-medial word order, not necessarily SVO,
   (4) versatility of verbs used for aspect, modality, multi-verb constructions, etc.,

                                    ABSTRACT
       This is a grammar of Iu Mien language, spoken by some 46,000 Iu Mien people
in Thailand, which has been derived from the data collected by the author whilst living
among the villages of Chiang Rai and Phayao provinces between 1994 – 2015. The
thesis comprises three parts: (i) the onomastics found in Chinese-written documents,
literature review, Thailand’s National Language Policy draft, (ii) the grammatical
descriptions in seventeen chapters, (iii) the representative text and metalanguage in the
appendices.
           The data have been collected through cultural immersion method, the
grammar analysed through judicious monolingual discussions with the native speakers
to secure description on its own terms, and presented with occasional forays into
information structure, Construction Grammar and Cognitive Grammar; occasionally
addressing matters of typology.
       A grammatical description of Iu Mien is momentous because the existing
literature is (i) heavily inclined toward historical linguistics, (ii) a grammar written in
English is dated, (iii) many published grammars are sketchy, only written in Chinese,
(iv) a recent reference grammar written in Chinese mostly presents the parts-of-speech
and sentence patterns with no analyses.
       The grammar establishes seven operational principles found in the structure of
Iu Mien:
   (1) Topic-Focus orientation,
   (2) multilayered focus structure with prominence on the sentence final position,
   (3) verb-medial word order, not necessarily SVO,
   (4) versatility of verbs used for aspect, modality, multi-verb constructions, etc.,
   (5) vague distinction across “parts-of-speech”,
   (6) sentence final particles as epistemic grounding elements,
   (7) culturally affected argument structure, i.e. the relationship between verbs and
      noun phrases in a sentence.
      The goal of this thesis is to describe Iu Mien making the grammar accessible both
to linguists and also to those in Iu Mien-speaking communities in Thailand, the US, and
elsewhere; thus all example sentences are interlinearised tri-scripturally, i.e. IPA, the
Romanised script, and the Thai-based Iu Mien orthography.                                           xxx

        Therefore, a proposal for Iu Mien with regard to such an approach would be
labelling of NP roles or argument roles summarised by Grimes (1975:116ff) for
discourse analysis, originally developed by Fillmore (1968). Furthermore, some have
been added/modified to Grimes’ tool in order to interpret what argument roles NPs
have in constructions occurring in Iu Mien.
   Experiencer (EX): A modification is proposed to Grimes’ first item, that is, “Object”.
    According to him, the Object (O) “identifies the things that is moving in the
    dynamic case, or the things that is in a particular position in the static case”
    (Grimes 1975:120). We would rather use “Experiencer” (EX) in order to avoid
    potential confusion with the traditional term “object” (i.e. nouns in accusative
    case). E.g., in mbopv (EX) tiux [squirrel run] ‘a squirrel ran’, mbopv is experiencing
    a motion of running.
   Source (S) “applies to motions but not positions. It identifies the location of the
    object at the beginning of the motion, the initial boundary of the event” (ibid.).
    E.g., Ninh yiem Naanh (S) daaih [3SG be.in Nan come] ‘He/she came from Nan
    province’.
   Goal (G) “applies to motions but not positions. It identifies the location of the
    object at the end of the motion, the terminal boundary of the event” (ibid.). Ninh
    taux biauv (G) [3SG reach house] ‘He reached the house’.
   Allative (ALL). Closely related to (G) above, a term is necessary to refer to an
    aimed goal but not necessarily reached. For this semantic role, Allative (ALL), is
    helpful to describe the contrast between the following examples: Ninh taux biauv
    (G) vs. Ninh nzuonx biauv (ALL) [3SG return house] ‘He left for home’. In the latter
    case, whether “he” has arrived home or not is unknown but what is clear is he has
    started off toward it.
   Range (Rg) is Grime’s term “for the relationship that others have labelled locative,
    locus, place, or site” (1975:121). “In an expression of motion, range indicates the
    path or area traversed, as in the ball (TH) rolled down the gutter (Rg)” (ibid). Yie nyei
    jui njangx wuov jauv (Rg) mignh [1SG POSS basket roll DEM road] ‘My basket rolled
    down that road’.
   Vehicle (V) “refers to something that conveys the object and moves along with it,
    as in the letter (TH) came by plane (V) or the tide (V) floated the oil slick (TH) into the
    harbor (G)” (1975:122).
   Theme (TH): A modification has been made to Grime’s “Patient”, which he defines
    as “the relation between a thing that gets changed and the process that changes
    it, or in the static sense, between a thing that is in some state and the state it is
    in” (1975:123). This should be referred to as “Theme” (TH) in terms of semantic                                             233
    role. An example of THEME is Fu’jueiv muoqv korm (TH) waaic [child mess computer
    be.broken] ‘A child broke the computer by messing around it.’ E.g., duih mbiungc
    (TH) [fall rain] ‘it is raining’. Note that the traditional syntactic term “patient” is
    still and sometimes used in a loose sense by some scholars for convenience, e.g.,
    LaPolla and Poa (2006:281) quoted in §4.2.6.2 and Sposato (2014:111) in
    §4.2.6.3.
   Material (M) and result (Rs) “identify the state of something before and after it
    undergoes a process” (1975:125). Longc ndiangx (M) gomv biauv (Rs) [use wood
    build house] ‘to build a house with wood’.
   Recipient (R) could be added to Grimes’ above listed roles, which occurs in a
    ditransitive clause. Yie bun norm yienv (TH) meih (R) [1SG give CLF bowl 2SG] ‘I give
    you a bowl’.","[268, 269, 270]"
"                                                                 522
9.2.2.3 Post-VP locative adverbial noun phrases
         The locative adverbs are expressed by a locative noun without any sort of
marking such as English equivalent of “to” or “from”. This construction occurs with
the verbs of directional movement like mingh ‘to go’, nzuonx ‘to return’, ndortv ‘to fall’,
faaux ‘to climb, ascend’, njiec ‘to descend’, dnorpc ‘to collapse’, cuotv ‘to go out’. The
term “locative” for Iu Mien indicates direction thereto, direction therefrom, and
location therein.
         Note that there is no preposition-like word between the verb and the following
noun in (649). The noun can be interpreted as a locative adverb or a noun in S(OURCE)
semantic role: (649) Yie         mbuo           cuotv      biauv(S).
           เยีย    บัว            ธ้วด       เปย๊ า(S).
           iə˦     buə˦           tsʰʷət˥    pʲau˦˥˧
           1    PL        exit     house
            ‘We are leaving home.’
           (ium_20130517_01_H1_DA_GF_LangSession_KMB;00.41.30-31)
Admittedly, there can be two positions to interpret this example. One is to take biauv
as the ‘directional adverb’ as in English home (Schachter and Shopen 2007:20) or as a
noun-derived adverb like tomorrow (ibid. 21), and the other is to consider the clause
to contain a transitive verb with an A and O argument. To the latter a similar stance
can be found in Enfield (2007:390-4) with regard to the Lao locative verb juu1 ‘to be
located, to be at’ in saying that “[it] may take a theme as its subject and a location as
its object”, i.e., phen1 juu1 talaat5 [3.P be.at market] ‘She is at the market’ (Enfield
2007:390). Our approach, however, has much more affinity to the former position as
has been argued for in §4.3.1 that pragmatics determines NP roles in a sentence. Also
this may be another piece of evidence for Principle 5: a vague distinction between
“parts-of-speech” (§4.2.1), in this case between nouns and adverbs.
         The following idiomatic expression also has an adverbial noun after the verb

NAMES: FROM ONOMASTICS TO MORPHOLOGY AND
                                      SYNTAX     Introduction
       Names are extremely important to the Iu Mien, as was glimpsed in §4.2.3.1.
This importance claimed by the native speaker themselves will be considered at the
outset of this chapter immediately after this introduction. Having presented the origin
of twelve fingx ‘clans’ (Figure 6) and twelve mbuox ‘names’ (Table 2a-b) in §2.2.2.4,
we now turn to the naming system (onomastics) of the Iu Mien in order to investigate
strategies of compound words. Thus, the goal of this chapter is to bridge between
onomastics and morphology and syntax, peculiar as it may sound. This was our main
native speaker consultant Zanh Gueix-Fongc’s wisdom that if the grammar should be
accepted by and helpful to the Iu Mien themselves, particularly for its purpose of
language revitalisation, it should start with the familiar subjects to them, hence names
and traditions (e.g. Jiex Sen Borngv ‘The Mountain Crossing Passport’ in §2.2.2 and
Piu-Yiuh Jiex Koiv ‘The Sea Crossing Odyssey’ in §2.2.3).
       Upon exchanging a few greeting words (usually by childhood name), the next
thing an Iu Mien person would ask or be asked is “What is your adult name?” and
“What is your clan name?”, followed by an enquiry into nyiemc cien /ɲiəm˩ tsʰiən˦/
‘recognition/acknowledgment of family relations’. These are ostensive linguistic
evidence for the importance of names. They are not only crucial in terms of speech
act to initiate and carry on conversations but also in terms of sociolinguistic solidarity.
Lombard and Purnell (1968:329) record the Iu Mien’s “clan names”, “generation
names”, “adult given names”, “spirit names”, “childhood names”, etc.
       The rest of the chapter, constituting the major sections (§5.3 and §5.4), will be
drawing on Anderson’s The Grammar of Names (2007) to address the issues of
vocatives and nomination, focusing on the use of the Iu Mien names as addressatives
(including the custom of nyiemc cien) and on the verb heuc /heu˩/ ‘to call’ as an act of
naming and the verb phrase cuotv mbuoz /tsʰuət˥ buə˨˧/ [issue name] ‘to issue a name,
or to name’. The latter issue (§5.5) is a preview of the argument structure, which will
be explicated in Chapter 11.","[290, 291]"
"        Therefore, what is the lesson learned? Drawing on insights from the analyses
of other languages in Southeast Asia attracted by their similarity is helpful but it
should be done with a careful attention on the structure of Iu Mien in its own terms.
Yet, the insights from Chinese by Chao, LaPolla, LaPolla and Poa quoted above
buttressed with the recent research on information structure seem to be applicable to
Iu Mien. The issue of argument structure in conjunction with information structure in
sentences reflected in constituent order therein will be discussed in detail in Chapter
11.",[266]
"
18.3.5.1 The principle of iconicity
       When we consider the overall structure of an Iu Mien sentence posited in
§4.2.1, i.e., {topic first}{focus later} or {setting on the left}{main action on the right},
the right-ward place of the purpose/reason/simile clauses is problematic.
       Why do these subordinate clauses come in the place of focus, i.e., the latter
part of a sentence? The reason or motivation for that is a matter of iconicity. The Iu
Mien seem to perceive the relationship between the main clause and the subordinate
clause of purpose/cause/simile in terms of an actual order of an event followed by an
abstract concept. In other words, a concrete action that happened (i.e. realis) is stated
first as the main clause; then, the purpose which is yet to happen (i.e. irrealis) is
appended as a subordinate clause. For the cause clause, the same principle is at work:
an actual event/action in realis is stated first; then, the reason for the past action is
added later for it is more abstract or conceptual. As to the simile clause, it is a                                            765
quotation of a common knowledge between the interlocutors from the memory,
history, cultural norm, proverbs, well-known phenomena, etc. to illustrate the main
message expressed in the preceding main clause. Hence, the information from an
abstract depository tends to be post-pended to comply with the principle of the
concrete-abstract in this respect. A summarising schematisation of this principle is:
     {concrete, visible, actual event} CL1MAIN, {abstract, invisible, mental info}CL2SUB
18.3.5.2 Purpose clause, weic ‘in order that’
          The purpose clause marked by weic ‘for, in order that’ occurs after a main
clause as in a formula:     CL1, weic CL2. [CL1]MAIN – [in.order.that CL2]SUB ‘CL1 in order that CL2’
An example of this construction is in (1020-1-2):    (1020-1)   [oix.zuqc     daix         norm        jai]CLMAIN

               Procedure of Betrothal Ceremony], KMB)
Observe that the act of killing a chicken is visible and tangible in contrast to the
religious or spiritual sense expressed in the purpose clause weic, which is placed after
the main clause. The principle of iconicity is to say what you are seeing first and a
reason afterward.","[801, 802]"

1.5.2 Theoretical Orientation
         In terms of theoretical propensity of this study, it is eclectic. This is so in the
sense that it comes from a spirit of descriptive, functional, usage-based, and
typological approach as illustrated in Shopen’s three volumes (2007) and in the
authors of the series A Cross-Linguistic Typology edited by Aikhenvold and Dixon. In
addition, the language description is in line with the constructionist approach
exemplified in such works as Croft (2001), Goldberg (1992, 1995, 2006, 2010) and
Lambrecht (1994) although it does not necessarily adhere to a particular brand of
Construction Grammar. As has been briefly pointed out (§1.2), Iu Mien exhibits
constituent order [NPAGT–V–NPPAT] or [Top / V–NP] as opposed to SVO, and also
manifests [V–NP], rather than being taken as [V–S]. It is argued in this grammar that
these grammatical forms are pragmatically motivated (as discussed in Lambrecht
(1994:29)) rather than seeing them as obligatorily grammaticalised.
         Having said that this grammar has typological inclination, a proviso may be
necessary. A comparison of Iu Mien with other genetically unrelated languages (e.g.
Indo-European or Semitic) is not in the scope of study inasmuch as the research on
language universals was beyond the intention of this grammar. But rather, its
comparison with the languages of areal and historical vicinity such as Hmong, Thai,
Lao, Mandarin and Cantonese in the existing works of other authors14 has been utilized
to exemplify much similarity and difference to a lesser extent.","[49, 50]"

              The last clause (791-5) shows two arguments that are entailed by the verb: the
source of blood and the blood that came out to the surface for observer’s eyes. Thought
the appearance of the word order is SVO, the focus is not on the agent (or Sbj) but the
result or phenomenon. And the result, the blood, is not an undergoer (patient in a
sense of a noun in accusative) of a volitional act of the source. Rather, the visible
result of bleeding is placed post-verbally, that is a focal point.
              Example (792) demonstrates a native speaker’s intuition that proper NPs must
occur in the proper positions of the clause. (792)          @@ nziaamv          cuotv       mba’zorng @@@

Since the post-verbal position is an observable/obvious focal point of speaker’s
attention, the picture the clause evokes is that noses are everywhere coming out from
the blood.

For the reason of familiarity, all of Chapter 5 is dedicated to the study of Iu Mien
names because everyone has names. This chapter will help Iu Mien see that their
names have grammar.
       Chapter 3 presents the phonological summary of the language including the
orthographies. Chapter 4 sets out seven working principles of the grammar, one of
which establishes the rightward multi-layered focus structure, i.e., the more rightward
(toward the end of a sentence) a constituent goes, the more focus it gets. The chapter
also previews grammatical categories or “parts-of-speech”. Chapter 5 is a bridge from
the morphology and word formation found in the study of Iu Mien names (i.e.
onomastics) to the study of compounds, noun phrases, and syntax.
       Chapter 6 considers the nominal, verbal, and adjectival compounds, including
psycho-collocations. Chapter 7 distinguishes Chinese-loan adjectives and the
adjectival verbs of Iu Mien origin, and focuses on the verbal nature of the latter.
Chapter 8 is on the noun phrases, including a comprehensive list of the sortal and
measure numerical classifiers and three types of relative clauses.
       Chapter 9 discusses the adverbial constructions, which readily utilize the
aspectual verb jienv /cʲen˦˥˨/ ‘to continue’ and the adverbialising particle nyei /ɲei˦/.
Chapter 10 argues that the copula construction is a linkage between the topic and the
focus predicate. Chapter 11 is on the verbs and argument structure, which includes
topics regarding the ditransitive constructions, the presentative constructions, and
four cases of a seemingly post-verbal subject.
       Chapter 12 gives an overview of auxiliaries, aspectual verbs and particles, and
modality including evidentials. Chapter 13 analyses the negative constructions, and
Chapter 14 presents the question constructions.
       Chapter 15 argues the multi-verb constructions in terms of mono-clausal and
multi-clausal MVCs. The former includes the serial verb constructions (SVCs), the
semantic role coverb phrases. It also addresses the similarity between the semantic
role coverb phrases and prepositions, the latter being rare but grammaticalisation
seems to be underway in the language.
       Chapter 16 and Chapter 17 are considered with reference to the egocentric
viewing arrangement (in terms of Cognitive Grammar) in relation to environment,
events and state of affairs that surround the speaker. Chapter 16 analyses the spatial
constructions, and Chapter 17 argues that the verbs duqv /tuʔ˥/ ‘to get’ and zuqc
/t͡suʔ˩/ ‘to touch’ are in contrast in the sense that the former relates the speaker with
the world favourably, while the latter does adversively.","[54, 55]"
"      Linguistic Environment
         Southeast Asia is a home to vast linguistic diversity, embracing five major
linguistics phyla or families. According to Matisoff (2001:295-8) the following
families are recognised:

  The forward slash ‘/’ indicates the boundary between left-position element (i.e. topic) and the rest of
the clause following Enfield’s Lao grammar (2007:4). It should be noted that terms like “preposed” or
“dislocated” are not used in that the frequency of this constituent order is much higher than so-called
“SVO” order in Iu Mien.",[40]
"It is clearly stated that Mother Tongues of the ethnic minorities should be used as a
means of communication or the teaching medium for children (dek เด็ก, the last word
of the last underlined part on p. 6) and youth (เยาวชน, the second word in the first                                            116

school curriculum. Together with the change of term “hill tribes” (ชาวเขา) to “ethnic
minorities” (ชาติพน
                  ั ธุ์) among the scholars, the sensitivity toward understanding of
feelings of children and young people by the Committee to Draft the National
Language Policy (CDNLP) given they have hosted numerous forums to interact with
the local communities should be deeply appreciated. It is hoped that such an outlook
should be communicated to the local communities including children and youth
effectively.
           However, the reality at present, as has been in the long past as well, is reflected
in the following confessions by the Iu Mien youth. A nine year old male student says

2.3.1.7 Martha Ratliff (2010)
       Although this is not a grammatical work but primarily the comparative-
historical linguistics of Hmong-Mien (which will be reviewed in §2.3.2), Ratliff has                                          77
reconstructed some important grammatical constructions. They include numerals
(both native and borrowed), personal pronouns (e.g. dual and inclusive/exclusive),
demonstratives, and classifiers. Development of grammatical constructions may also
be a result of language contact. Among the ample examples she presents, the following
instances of White Hmong also shed light on present-day Mien as in Table 5:Table 5. Chinese grammatical constructions borrowed into Iu Mien and White

       As will be evident in Chapter 5 onwards, Iu Mien grammar exhibits striking
similarity to Chinese. Ratliff delineates the typologically shared grammatical features
as follows:         […] in morphology, Hmong-Mien languages are characterized by the lack
         of inflectional morphology and the heavy use of compounds and
         reduplication. In syntax, Hmong-Mien language show SVO word order,
         paratactic rather than embedded structures (serial verb, serial noun, and
         serial sentence constructions), use of both a polar question particle and the
         A-not-A construction, Wh-question words in situ, adversative passives, and
         aspect markers rather than tense markers. Final discourse particles signal
         speaker attitude (Ratliff 2010:227-8).","[113, 114]"

     Pragmatics Determines Semantic Roles of Argument NPs
       LaPolla’s (1995:310) statement quoted in the last section (§4.2.6.3) is almost
axiomatic when it comes to argument structures in Iu Mien. It is not a word order
(e.g. SVO) or syntax that determines which NP is treated as a core argument in relation
to a predicate verb in a sentence. It is neither semantic roles of NPs that account for
grammatical facts about core arguments. Rather, it is pragmatics that determines
semantic roles of argument NPs. This is summarised in the seventh principle, which
reads as follows:        Principle 7. The argument structure in Iu Mien, or the relationship between
        verbs and NPs in a sentence, is aligned by pragmatics, specifically by the
        verb’s rich cultural semantic frame. That is, cultural knowledge around the
        event or situation the verb designates determines what should be treated as
        core arguments.","[267, 268]"
