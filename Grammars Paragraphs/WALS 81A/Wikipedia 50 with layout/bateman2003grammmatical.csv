"6.3.2 Nouns Ordered by Topicality
Nouns in Iau clauses are not ordered according to their grammatical function. That is, they can
occur in the order subject followed by object, or in the order object followed by subject. It is in
fact difficult in Iau to find criteria for labeling a noun as subject or object. The rule of thumb for
the ordering of nouns is as follows: if a noun is the topic of the clause, then it is placed at the
beginning of the clause to the left of other nouns. Other nouns are positioned from left to right in
order of topicality. The following set of sentences illustrate this.
         1.A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷       e⁸       da⁹ki⁶ y⁴.
          I book see-TOT.INC Nomin good          Info-SNC.NA.NDT

6.3 Word Order In Iau Clauses6.3.1 Verb Final
As we have seen in preceeding sections, in Iau the verb with its associated particles always
occurs clause final as is re-illustrated in the following example.
    A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷         se⁵.
    1s book see-TOT.INC Inten
    I am going to look at books.
In the Iau clause above, the verb follows the two nouns. The intention particle “se⁵” is part of the
verb phrase and functions as part of the clause periphery.","[91, 92]"
"6.3.3 Order in focus- presupposition clauses.
As we have also seen above, focus presupposition clauses in the form of cleft constructions are
also common in Iau (It was the dog that…). In these kinds of sentences, the word order is
reversed. The new predicated information is placed on the left side of the clause, the already
given /known /topical information is placed to the right as shown below.
       New Predicated Info             Topic/Given/Known
       IO           Subj              Obj IO       Verb
       Dai³ du⁷be⁷ Benyamin be-8 da⁷ bv⁸            da⁸ tv      -9?
       cassowary it was that Benjamin PredInfo -Ag dog for carry go away -Tot.Punc
       It was cassowary that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for.
In the example above the given known topical information is that someone took a dog out
hunting. The statement above identifies what they were hunting, the main new information and
who was the agent. The topical information is placed on the right, the new information is placed
on the left. The identity of the agent is known but important to be specified so it is placed in the
middle position, partially predicated but also known information.",[93]
"5.2 The Noun Phrase
Noun phrases in Iau are in the order of the noun followed by the modifier as illustrated in the
example below.
        Du⁹       a⁹       bi⁷si⁹    a⁷se⁹  ba³.
        wild pig another one         SeqMkr shoot-TOT.DUR
        He shot another wild pig.
In the Iau example above, wild pig, the noun is followed by two modifiers a⁹ `another' and bi⁷si⁹
`one'.
The chart below shows the kinds of modifers that occur in Iau and the order in which they occur.
 HEAD         Modifier1 Modifier       Modifier3      Modifier4     Modifier5            Modifier6

                          Ordering of Modifiers in the Iau Noun Phrase.",[61]
"6.3.2 Medial Verb Clauses
Medial verbs are a class of verbs characteristic of the non Austronesian languages of Papua,
Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Medial verbs in these languages do not carry the full tense,
aspect, and mood information marked on independent verbs. They are frequently used to form
sentences with long strings of dependent clauses ending in a final independent clause. Many
languages with medial verbs are also characterized by switch reference marking systems in
which a marker on the medial verb indicates whether its subject is the same subject or a different
subject than the subject of the main clause or a subsequent clause. No evidence of this kind of
system has been found in Iau.
Medial verb clauses in Iau are also characterized by an obligatory 2 syllable clitic conjunction
which occurs clause final and marks dependent relationships such as temporal sequence, reason,
grounds, adversative, temporal margins, prerequisite events and chains of events as illustrated
below.",[94]

1.0 INTRODUCTION2
Iau3 is a Papuan language spoken by over 1500 speakers who live along the Van Daalan River, a
southern branch of the Tariku /Rouffaer River in the Western Lakes Plains area. They are located
in the District of Fawi, Puncak Jaya Regency, Papua, Indonesia. (Ethnologue). GPS coordinates
for the main village of Fawi are: 03 13.86S 137 43.56E
The Lakes Plains Languages were originally grouped with the Tor languages to the northeast as
part of the Trans New Guinea Languages (Wurm 1982, Voorhoeve 1975), but more recently with
the Geelvink/Cenderawasih Bay Languages such as Bauzi, Tunggare, and Burate (Clouse,
1997), And by some as an independent family (Ross 2005, Usher ) (See also Wikipedia).
The Iau dialect trio of Iau, Turu, and Foi along with Edopi are classified by Usher (2018) as
West Tariku4 languages as opposed to the Wapoga River, Central and Duvle-East languages.
The Glottologue makes the Tariku (River) languages into a broader grouping, which includes
East Tariku, Central Tariku, Duvle and West Tariku. In this classification Iau and the other 2
dialecs are classed as Central Tariku. Iau is also classified as a Central Tariku lanugage in
Clouse’s classification of Tariku (1997) which consists of six families—Tause, West Tariku,
Central Tariku. East Tariku, Duvle and West Lakes Plains.","[1, 2, 3]"

"2.5 Words
Words are the smallest units of speech that can be spoken with meaning in isolation. They are
potentially bounded by pause, and can written bounded by a space. Words in Iau like other
languages are of 5 basic types, nouns (people, places, things, or names), verbs, adverbs,
adjectives, and free standing grammatical particles or markings indicating relationships of
grammatical units with each other.",[9]
"5.1 The Verb Phrase
For a more detailed discussion see Bateman, 1986 and Bateman, 1990 both in NUSA.
The verb occupies the nuclear /head slot in the verb phrase. Each verb and post-verbal particle
slot have an accompanying set of tone morphemes that can occur on the particles in that
grammatical slot. In Iau only the verb and its accomanying aspect tone are obligatory.
In the Iau verb phrase only the head /nuclear element, the verb, is obligatory. In narrative
discourse, post verbal particles are rare and highly marked. By contrast in dialogue, post verbal
                                                                                                      32
particles marking epistemic, evidential and hearer-speaker dynamics are the norm. Each
discourse genre has it’s commonly occuring verb phrase forms. The pre-verbal constituents of
manner, directionals and locationals are found in all discourse types.
The following chart gives a list of slots in the verb phrase, the tone morpheme sets for each slot
and the required order for the slots.","[32, 33]"
"As illustrated above, Iau is an verb final language, The nouns in the clause core preceed the
clause nucleus. Examples 14 and 15 also show that ordering of nouns in the clause is not
determined by semantic role. In example 14 the order of the nouns is Agent followed by
Undergoer. In example 15, the order is Undergoer followed by agent. In example 14, the agent `I'
is also the clause topic, or what the clause is about (Dik 1978). But in example 15, the undergoer,
`sago' is the clause topic.
Examples 14 and 15 illustrate that ordering of nouns in Iau clauses is pragmatically determined.
Regarding the ordering of NP’s, the more topical nouns are placed to the left of less topical
nouns.
Examples 14 and 15 differ in another way. In 14, the unmarked pronoun form a⁹ for first person
singular is used. In 15, when 1st person singular agent is not clause topic, the marked pronoun
form bv⁶ is used. This illustrates that the unmarked expectation in an Iau clause is that agent will
also be topic. If not, and if the agent is first person singular pronoun, it must be marked as non-
topical agent. None of the other pronouns have a separate form for non-topical agent.
As also illustrated above, Iau nouns and pronouns are normally unmarked for semantic role.
Under certain discourse conditions, nouns in Iau are marked for semantic case roles. This will be
discussed in Section *.
Iau is a pro-drop language with no verb agreement. The following portion of a procedural text
(See 3.7 for full text), illustrates the pro-drop phenomena in Iau. The clauses illustrating prodrop
are in bold in the text.16a. Ty⁷ fv⁷ ae⁶ da⁸dv⁹

"6.0 LAYERED CLAUSE STRUCTURE: NUCLEUS, CORE, PERIPHERY
Words and particles combine to form phrases. Words and phrases combine to form clauses.
Clauses like phrases have language specific structure.
Clauses in various languages are sometimes classified on the basis of verb types such as stative,
equative, intransitive, transitive and bitransitive. The classification of Iau clauses on the basis of
verb types, is not a very helpful classification, since Iau verb stems do not have inherent lexical
transitivity. The following are some examples of clauses varying in transitivity but using the
same verb.
        BE =be in or on a place
                          NP ADJ              V

"In the example above LDP 1 is marked off by the usual spacer and topicalizes the narrator. The
next LDP (2) topicalizes a man who ate breadfruit with them. Eating and hunting are highly
emotive parts of a travelog. So this man is topicalized in an LDP. In order to give additional
information about his identity, the speaker by pauses and the use of the identity particle by⁷
blocks off a third LDP. The fourth LDP is used to bring the narrative back to the highest
topicalized participant and what the narrator wants to say about him, that they ate breadfruit
together.",[82]
"The question above is not about the past but about who currently is in the habit of making mats,
or who is currently using the stick. Perhaps the speaker want to order one. The speaker receives
the answer that the Dani people have and still are making these mats.
The di particle refers to a definite punctual viewpoint event. The tone 3 morpheme means the
action has been realized. This is a commonly used stem to mean that an action has already been
done /completed.

"Tone 9
Tone 9 is inherently totality of the action /proposition and punctual viewpoint. So it views the
situation as a fact at some time (past, present, future, or hypothetical) in order to comment on it.
The following examples of tone 9 on the particles di, be and se illustrate the use of the epistemic
                                                                                                    45

In Iau topic comment clauses, there is a special marking structure for discourse contexts in which
a noun rather than the verb becomes the primary information which is being asserted about the
topic as illustrated below.
       Di⁹ te⁷bv⁹ y⁸ a⁸?
       You why cry are doing
       Why are you crying?
       Da⁷ o⁸sy⁹ ty⁷ di⁸ to⁹.

       Someone killed my dog.
       Y⁵! Ty⁷⁻⁸ be-8     di³?
       Oh! who FocusHd-Cs kill
       Oh, who killed it?
       Das⁷⁻⁸ be-8    di³.
       Das FocusHd-Cs kill
       Das killed it.
In the example above, in the second sentence the dog is established as topic and the verb
‘killed’is the focus –the information being asserted/predicated about the dog. But in the
following sentences the new information being asserted shifts from the verb to the identity of the
agent. The clause structure however has not changed. The focus shift from verb to noun is
marked by the be particle on the noun indicating that it is focus head.
Topic-comment structure is the normal unmarked clause structure in Iau . Topical nouns are
placed to the left in order of degree of topicality.
             TOPIC COMMENT
         .   A⁹    bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷ se⁵
             I      book see intend

             a. When the clothes are dry, then
               b. people take them to the house againThe topic comment construction primarily marks the fronted nouns as topical and presupposed.
The rest of the clause is comment and focus.","[85, 86]"
"In the first example above, the speaker is refuting the basic underlying assumption that the
woman in question is married. The second example illustrates the use of the particle ‘to’ to
emphasize that Speaker 2's own experience in using goggles to catch fish is contrary to Speaker
1's who has never used them.
The particle ‘e’ is more rare than the other mood particles in conversational discourse. The ‘e’
particle is used on statements that the hearer is using to justify or explain his action. The
following segment of conversational discourse illustrates this.

     Yes, I have some but I came in order to ask you (first)
      (if you wanted any.)
The final sentence marked by the particle ‘e’ functions in the discourse context to give
information explaining why Speaker 1 came to Speaker 2 to ask him about corne.",[54]
"9.1.3 Where Questions
Either the simple question word te⁸ or te⁸ plus the noun as focus marker be⁷ can be used to ask
the identity of a location. The following sentences are examples.
    1.Di⁹ te⁸           i⁹ a³?
     you what(place) go Pres Prog
    Where are you going?

The `where' question words illustrated above are the words used when the speaker wants the
hearer to inform him of the location of something.

source location of something.

speaker is using location to identify which of several objects is being discussed. These are
discussed in the following section on which question words.",[114]

6.1.1 CLAUSE NUCLEUS
The clause nucleus consists of the verb, adverb, and the nuclear operators of aspect, stative and
directionals. Iau is a SOV language so the clause nucleus is clause final. So the clause nucleus is
the default unit of predication.
The following are some illustrations of the Iau clause nucleus. The nucleus is in bold.
    1.    Ba⁹        o⁸sy⁹   ba⁷bv⁹   e⁹-fe⁷ da⁹ki³     au⁷     bi⁸bay -4
          word       my      this     me-for good       very    hear-TEL.INC    de-8       dy³.
    Sta- CRlz Imper
    Hear my words well.
    2.  A⁹ av⁸be⁸ bui²             i -7      se⁵.
        I quickly upstream        go-TOT.INC      intend
    I am going to go quickly upstream
The constituents of the clause nucleus are both segmental and suprasegmental. Their ordering is
illustrated below.
          Adv +                Verb                  +Stative
          Directionals
          ---------------      +Aspect (Tone)        +Status (Tone)
          da⁹ki³ au⁷           bi⁸bay⁴               de⁸
          well                 hear-TEL.INC          stative- CRlzThe unmarked position of adverbs preceeding directionals and the verb, but juxtaposed to them
is illustrated in example 2 above. The tones on adverbs and directionals appear to be lexically
and not grammatically determined. While adverbs normally are adjacent to the verb, a noun
which is closely tied to the predicate can come between the adverb and the verb as illustrated
below.
    3.  A⁹ sai⁷fo⁸ du⁸av⁵du⁸ be³        ta⁹ du⁷            se⁵.
        I just slowly          clearing in go-TOT.INC intend
        I am just going to slowly walk around the village (go in clearing =idiom for walk
    around).
Aspect is realized as a set of tone morphemes occuring on the segmental verb stems.
The verb may be followed by a stative particle de.","[71, 72]"

       *Specifier –see belowSpecifiers
Following the classifiers are another group of modifiers, the specifiers. These particles specify
certain members of a class as opposed to others. Specifier particles are words like ‘another one,
some, or a different one’. The following are some examples in Iau.
       ty⁷                  a⁹              another person

       person   group       anotherDescriptive Adjectives
The descriptive adjectives follow the classifier and specifier particles. The following noun phrase
is an example.
    Du⁹      a⁹       i⁸si⁴ba⁷
    wild-pig another big
    a big wild-pig, another big wild-pigQuantifiers
The quantifiers follow the descriptive adjectives in Iau noun phrases as illustrated below.
    Du⁹      a⁹      i⁸si⁴ba⁷ bo⁴ be⁷
    wild pig another big      two
    Two other big pigsDemonstratives
Following the quantifiers in the noun phrase are the demonstrative adjectives such as `this' or
`that'. The ordering of the demonstrative adjectives after the quantifiers is illustrated below.
    Ty⁷      bo⁴ ba⁷bv⁹
    person two this
    these two peopleCase Marking Particles
The final particles in the Iau noun phrase are the optional particles which mark the case role of
the noun relative to discourse topic.The also mark the information in the noun phrase as
predicated information. For more information on predicated information see section 6.2 below
about pragmatic focus –presupposition and the Iau clause.
The following is a list of the focus/case marking particles in Iau.
    be⁷ /be⁴ /be⁸marks noun phrase as predicated information about the case role of noun relative
                 to discourse topic
    by⁷ same as be⁷ but refers to a specific item or individual known to the hearer
    di⁷ body part as instrument
    fe⁷ /fa⁷ benefactive
    bv⁸ goal (for, to)
    fi⁵ undergoer source (take away from)                                                                                                    62
The noun markers be and by are used to mark noun phrases when the noun phrase is part of the
new information that is being predicated about the topic. This is illustrated by the following
question and answer set.
    Kaf⁷ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸ taui⁷    di³?
    bow this   who TopCMkr make-TOT.INC PBd-RLZ
    Who made this bow?
    Das⁷⁻⁸ be⁸             taui⁷        di³.
    Das    TopCMkr         make-TOT.INC PBd-RLZ
    Das made it.
In the question and answer set above, the speaker and hearer are talking about a topic, a bow that
someone made. The new information that the questioner wants to know is: who made the bow. In
the example above the question word `who' and the name `Das' are both marked with the same
noun marker be⁸ to indicate that this noun and not the verb is the new information that is being
predicated about the topic, the bow.
The tone on these particles indicates the case role of the noun. The be and by noun markers have
three tone variants. The tone 8 variant be⁸ indicates that the marked noun is the causative agent
that acted on the topic noun. In the previous example Das was the one who acted on the bow and
made it. This is indicated by the tone 8 on the be⁸ case marker. The following sentence is an
another example.
       Ty⁷        bi⁷si⁹   a⁷se⁹  u⁶          bi⁸      be⁸           da⁸
       person     one      SeqMkr before      news     Focus.Cs      carry-RES.DUR
       i⁷           da⁸dv⁹       ty⁷      a⁷se⁹    fa³fu⁷ ba⁸day³.
       go-TOT.INC MVClMkr person SeqMkr all                 flee-TOT.DUR
       Someone had already taken the news before (we got there) and so they had all already
       fled.
The sentence above is answering the question `So you didn't actually kill any one on the raid?'
The answer is “No”. The reason is because of the news that had been carried to the people ahead
of time. The noun bi⁸ `news' is marked by the be⁸ particle as the cause of conversation topic, the
fact that they did not kill anyone.
When a tone 4 occurs on the topic case marker be⁴, it indicates that the noun is either acted on
by the topic or the noun is the instrument or means of acting on the topic. This is illustrated by
the following examples:
       1. Fi⁹     kae² be⁴         o⁹       a⁴.
          fish    net NMkr-Mns take-TOT.PUN            DUBd-URLZ
          Fish are caught by means of nets.
       2. Kae² fi⁹      be⁴ o⁹                     a⁴.
          net fish NMkr-Mns take TOT PUN           DUBd URLZ
          Nets are the means of catching fish.
In both sentences the relationship between fish and nets is the same. Nets are the means by which
the undergoer,`fish', is affected. The first sentence answers the question `What is used for
catching fish?' The second sentence answers the question `What are nets used for?'
The tone 7 variant be⁷ is used to mark nouns in clauses in which some other noun is the
predicated new information or it is used to mark nouns which are already partially known or
highly expected in the context. The following are some examples.
       1. To⁸     tai⁷ ba⁷bv⁹   By⁵ be⁷⁻⁸de³ U⁸du⁸ba⁸dvs⁹   bo⁴
          pig    leg this       Bih also     Udubadus(also) two
       a⁷se⁹      tai⁷ be⁷       o⁹.
       SeqMkr leg NMk take-TOT.PUN
       As for the pig's leg, both Bih and Udumadus grabbed it.
       2. Bv⁷     da⁷ du⁷be⁷ a⁹ be⁷           di³.
          this    dog that       SI NMkr      kill-TOT.DUR
         This is a dog that I killed.
The be noun markers will be discussed in more detail in a separate section below.
The first example above is taken from a portion of a text that is about catching a pig. The
narrator is telling which body part each of the participants grabbed in order to catch the pig. The
                                                                                                     63
fact that the participants grabbed onto a body part of the pig is highly expected in the context.
The be⁷ marker with a tone 7 marks the specific identity of the body part as highly expected. The
second example illustrates the use of a tone 7 on the be particle to mark a noun which is not the
new or unknown noun in the context. In (2) above, the hearer already knows that the speaker is
the one who killed the animal.
 The particle di⁷ is used in Iau to mark a body part which is used as an instrument. The following
is an example.
       Bo⁸de⁷    ty⁷      a⁷se⁹     e⁸ -di⁷       di³.
       ball      person SeqMkr foot -Instr        hit-TOT.DUR
       He kicked the ball with his foot.
The particles fe⁷ and fa⁷ are used interchangeably to mark a noun phrase as a benefactive. The
following sentence is an example.
       Ui⁸       e⁸` -fe⁷    davy⁷      dy³.
       house     me -Benef make-TOT.INC Imp
       Build a house for me.
The noun marker bv⁸ is used to indicate that the noun is the goal toward which an entity is
moving. The following are some examples.
       1. A⁹ ui⁸      bv⁸ i⁹.
          I house to go-TOT.PUN
          I am going to the house.
       2. A⁹ du⁹      bv⁸ da⁷ da⁸ i⁹.
          I wild pig for dog carry      go-TOT.PUN
          I took my dog hunting for wild pigs.
In the first example, bv⁸ marks the location toward which the moving object is moving. In the
second example bv⁸ marks the goal of the action, ie what the hunter is going to get.
The particle bv⁸ occurs alone without an associated noun when it refers back to the sentence
topic. The following is an example where the particle bv⁸ refers back to du⁹ `wild pig', the
sentence topic.
       Du⁹      ty⁷      a⁷se⁹     bv⁸ da⁷ da⁸      i⁹.
       wild pig person SeqMkr for dog carry         go-TOT.PUN
       They have taken the dogs to go hunting wild pigs.
The particle fi⁵ is used in Iau to mark a noun that was formerly the location or possessor of an
object, but another participant took it away from him. The particle fi⁵ marks an undergoer source.
the following is an example.
       Di⁹      a⁷se⁹    y⁸ fi⁵        vy⁸ be⁷⁻⁸   a⁷se⁹    ui⁸      bv⁸ i⁹.
       things   SeqMkr we from         take SClMkr SeqMkr house to go.TOT.PUN
       When they had taken our things from us, we went to the house.
In the example above fi⁵ marks the pronoun y⁸ `we' as the source from which the things were
taken.
Locative postpositions also occur noun phrase final. These will be discussed in Section 2.8.1
below.","[61, 62, 63, 64]"
"6.5 Clauses, The Building Blocks Of Sentences.
Clauses are primarily the building blocks that form sentences. They can be embedded within
other clauses in noun slots as nominalized clauses in order to describe or identify participants in
terms of events. They can also form complex sentences by being embedded in temporal
adverbial slots in the form of dependent clauses. Or as independent with no embedded temporal
adverbial clauses, clauses can combine with each other in additive relationships to form
compound sentences. (See the section on sentence types below)
So, clauses in Iau can be classified into 4 types according how they are used in other sentences
and clauses. These four types are independent clauses, medial clauses, subordinate and
nominalized clauses. The following section of a narrative text consisting of one long sentence
(which is very common in Iau narrative) illustrates all four types of Iau clauses. In the example
below, nominalized clauses are on the far left margin, independent clauses next, medial verbs
next and subordinate clauses the most indented.

"2.5.2 Grammatical Characteristics of Words
Iau nouns are unmarked grammatically, or pragmatically.They occur in the beginning and middle
parts of the sentence. They are optionally marked for pragmatic and semantic roles by the be
particle.
Iau adjective are optionally marked for their pragmatic role in defining which item of several
options is being dicussed. They are also marked by the focus particle be⁷ with a tone 7.
Iau adverbs can be marked in some cases also by the particle be with a tone 4

2.5.3 Multisyllabic Words
Multisyllabic words are often loan words from Indonesian or morphemically complex.. These
two types differ in stress patterns. Indigenous Iau multi morpheme, multisyllable words have
word final stress. This is because stress is pragmatically determined. Stress marks the nuclear
component of the grammatical unit and is manifested by length.","[9, 10]"

The first question above is a yes-no question. A speaker asks a yes-no question to find out if the
information in the question is true or not. When the speaker asks a yes-no question, he wants the
hearer to confirm or deny the information in the question. In the example above, the speaker is
not sure whether the the plane is coming or not.
The second question above is an example of a content question. Content questions are who,
what, when, where, why, how questions. The speaker asks a content question when he doesn't
know some specific bit of information in the sentence. In the Iau content question in (2) above,
the speaker doesn't know the identity of the subject so he asks the hearer,""Who is it that arrived?""
The question word `who' is underlined in example (2) above. Each of the two kinds of questions
in Iau will be discussed in detail in the following sections.","[109, 110]"
"2.5.1 Phonological Characteristics of Words
As noted at the beginning of this section, words in Iau are identified by potential pause
preceeding or following the word. Words in Iau are mostly monosyllabic with some two syllable
words and a few three syllable words.
Most monosyllablic words (V,VV. VVV. CV, CVV, CVVV, or CVC /VC) are indigenous Iau
words. As nouns, adjectives, adverbs they are single morphemes. But as verbs and sometimes
particles, they are morphemically complex as we shall see below.",[9]
"        Y⁸ su⁴ fe⁷⁻⁸
        we die lest/might
        We might die./Lest we die (contradesiderative)
There are other tone sequences that occasionally show up on verbs expressing aspectual nuances
that are extremely contextual and speaker perspective oriented. These occur in natural text but
are difficult to elicit.

2.3 Syllable Structure
Iau is basically a monosyllabic language. The syllable structure allows complex syllable nuclei
of up to 3 vowels. There are no consonant clusters and only one type of closed syllable ending in
an unreleased [p]with very limited distribution.
       ONE SYLLABLE WORDS

       baui³ arrive       CVVV
       faf³ axe           CVC
The eight Iau vowels a,i,i-,y,e,u,v,o are distributed in VV complex vowel nuclei as follows:
        V1            V²
                       i-            i        y           e           u          v

        o                                                 oe
Note that in the first vowel slot of VV nuclei, only a, and one of the back vowels u, v and o
occur. In the second vowel slot i-, i, y, e occur. The back vowel u and v also occurThe vowels a
and o do not occur as V².
There are only two types of VVV nuclei allowed, the sequence aui and the sequence avy as
shown below.

"3.0 MORPHEMES AND MORPHOLOGICALLY COMPLEX WORDS
In this section we will discuss morphologically complex words in Iau. We will mainly discuss
verb roots, stems and words as well as nouns and the clitics /affixes(?)3.1 Verb Roots Stems And Words3.1.1 Phonological Structure
Iau verbs, even the monosyllabic ones, are morphologically complex structures. A verb stem in
it’s most minimal form consists of a vowel and a tone, but most have a consonant onset. And the
vowel cluster can have up to three vowels. A verb stem may have a single tone or a cluster of
tones. The eight basic tone morphemes, each a composite of 2 different aspectual viewpoints, are
discussed in Bateman, 1986 ‘The tone morphemes and aspect in Iau.’ How the tone meanings
interact with the segmental roots and stems will be discussed in a separate section below. (See
Pawley 1987, 2006 for a non tonal language with complex predicates.)
The following are some examples of Iau verbs consisting only of a vowel root and a tone.
    +Vowel ROOT (1)        +TONE
    u⁹ go down from
    o³ float
    a⁷⁻³ scatter seed

2.4.1 Word Stress
Multisyllabic words carry stress.
Stress on indigenous Iau dissyllabic words falls on the final syllable.

        sa⁶i⁸ clothes (leaf-skin?)              CV-V
        i⁶su³ hair (head-hair)                  V-CVAs stated above, most Iau two syllable words are morphologically complex. Shoes is actually
foot-skin. Shoes are viewed as a kind of skin covering. It is the pragmatically (in this case also
semantic) nuclear syllable meaning skin that get the stress. The modifier -foot, is unstressed. It is
the same for i⁶su³, head hair. The word su means fur, hair, or feathers. The hair on our heads is a
type of hair. The modifier ‘head’ describes which kind of hair is being referred to. The syllable
meaning ‘hair’ is stressed and the modifier unstressed.
Stress on loan words from Indonesian keep the stress pattern of Indonesian which have stress on
the next to last syllable.

do⁸ba⁸ (domba)          congregation /sheep
sa⁷tu³ (satu)           one2.4.2 Phrase and clause stress
Stress placement is not only pragmatically determined on the word level, but also on higher
levels eg, word, phrase, clause etc. Stress on lower levels (such as word or phrase) is placed on
the word or syllable that is the pragmatic nucleus of the phrase. The sentence below consisting
of a noun phrase and a verb phrase illustrates this. The words in bold are stressed and have at
least twice the lenth of the syllables in italic. The syllables in italic in turn have twice the length
of the syllables in regular type

        Canoe big       the           carry-go Imperative
In the case of higher level structures (such as clause or sentence) extra stress is placed on the
semantic unit that is focus /comment in the clause or sentence.","[8, 9]"
"1.2 Language Characteristics .
Iau is a tonal language. Tone is both lexical and morphemic. In the Iau phoneme inventory, there
are 6 consonants, 8 vowels and 8 phonemic tones. There are no phonemic nasals. But there are is
nasal allophone of the vowel /a/ and nasal allophones of some of the voiced stops. Iau, like other
Lakes Plain languages has a high front vowel that is fricativized and implosive voiced stops.
(Bateman, 1990)
Iau is a verb final language. It has a left dislocated positions for topics at both clause and
sentence level. It has an extensive system for marking non verbal items as predicated new
information in the clause. These are used to introduce or confirm, or give identifying
information concerning participants, locations, time and other setting type information. Like
other Papuan languages, a characterisic feature especially in narrative discourse structure is the
use of repeated linking clauses (Bateman, 2020)2.0 PHONOLOGY2.1 Segmentals

Verbs are about events. There are inherently different types of events in the world. Some events
like boil /bring to a boil, or the rising and setting of the sun are inherent processes. Some like the
verb “run” inherently continue over time. Some events are processes with inherent endpoints,
like a tree falling to the ground. Some events like go, or come, are spoken of and viewed in their
totality, without focussing on any one part of the event. In many languages this information is
mostly implicit in the lexical meaning of the verb. In Iau, however, much of this type of
information is not indicated by the lexical form of the verb but by a combination of context and
tone morpheme aspect.
The chart below gives various examples of sets of verbs having the same segmental stem and
different lexical meanings..","[17, 18]"
"3.2 Nouns And Noun Morphology
There are no grammatical noun classes in Iau. Nouns form a single grammatical class. In general,
there is no inflection of nouns, ie no affixes marking for singular and plural, no marking for
gender, no case marking affixes (case marking takes place on the phrase level), or affixes
marking definiteness or indefiniteness. There are, however, a few locative nouns that undergo
tone changes or tone plus a vowel change in certain contexts. There are also a few agent
/instrument nouns that have tone and vowel changes that mark the noun as instrument or agent.
These are discussed along with tone changes on adverbs and noun phrases in a separate section
below (See 3.3 below)3.2.1 Derived Nouns
Iau has many nouns that appear to be derivatives of the verb stem or formed from the same roots
as the verb stems, or related to part of the verb stem. The following are some examples.
    Verb          u⁹        ‘to descend, come down from /out of’
    Noun          u⁹ki⁹      ‘a strap, a rink, a hook, ie hangs down /descends from something’
    Noun          u⁸        ‘vomit, saliva’ ie something that comes down out of the mouth
    Verb Root     o         to come out from something, to float to the surface, to
    Verb          o⁹        to give off light; to shine; to be lit
    Noun          o⁹su⁹;    rays of light; what is given off /shines from the sun, a lamp, a fire
    Adj           o³tu⁹     daylight the time when it is light /the sun is giving off light
    Verb Root o             to come out from something, to float to the surface, to
    Noun      o⁷            sandbar sticking up in the river; sand, gravel
    Noun (u⁸) o⁴            a splinter from a board /or on a board
    Noun      o⁷su⁹         leaf
In Iau things often have the same name as the material they are made of. The following are some
examples:
    fv⁷       a tree used for canoe making
    fv⁷       canoe
    to⁸       tree used for bark cloth
    to⁸       bark cloth3.2.2 Tone Morphology On Nouns, Noun Phrases And Adverbs
Tones on nouns, adverbs and adjectives is for the most part lexical, that is it is an inherent part of
the word and distinguishes one word from the other in cases where the segmental phonemes are
identical. For example the following words are minimal pairs.",[28]
"                                                                                                 111
9.2.1 Who /”Ty⁷⁻⁸’: questions about identity
Who questions are used when the normal focus item in the clause, the event, is known, but the
identity of the actor or agent for that event is unknown. The question word becomes the new
focus information about the topic, the rest of the clause.
There are two main `who' compound question words in Iau.
       ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴
       who? person identity marker
       ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸
       who? agent as focus/new unknown information
 The word ‘boe⁴’ (identity marker) used in the example below is in a topic as predicate focus
type sentence where the new predicated information is on the left side of the clause and marked
by ‘du⁷be⁷’.
    Ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³?       Si⁸a⁸da³ boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³.
     who ID that came           Janet ID Mkr that arrive
    Who is it that came? It's Janet that arrived.
    Ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴     du⁷be⁷ dui⁹       da⁹?      Epi boe⁴     du⁷be⁷ dui⁹    da⁹.
     who ID Mkr that w.pig-by bitten Epi Iden Mkr that w.pig-by bitten
    It was Epi who was bitten by a wild pig.
The question word with the boe⁴ identity particle can also be used when the `who' question word
occurs in the normal predicate position as illustrated below.
     Ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴?
      this who     ID mkr
     Who is this?
     A⁹ boe⁴ y³.
      I Iden Mkr Statement Mkr
     It's me.
As indicated above, the question word ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ consists of the question word ty⁷⁻⁸ `who' and the
identity marker boe⁴. The particle boe⁴ is used to mark statements of personal identity. The use of
the personal identity marker boe is also used to mark the identity information in the answers to
the questions in the illustrations above.
The question word ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸ consists of the question word ty⁷⁻⁸ and the noun marker be⁸. Be⁸
marks nouns or noun phrases within the clause when they are focus, predicated information. The
tone morpheme 8 marks them as causative agent The following is an example of the use of the
content question word ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸.
     Da⁷ ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸           di³?
     This dog, who NMkFocus/Ag killed (it)?
     Who killed this dog?
In the question above the question word `who' uses the noun marker be⁸ because the person the
speaker wants to know about is also the one who brought about the action. That is the speaker

The 8 contrastive tones /tone contours are lexically contrastive. The same 8 contrastive tones
occur also on verb stems provide 8 different lexicalized and grammaticalized aspectual
viewpoints. On particles, the 8 contrastive tone morphemes have a variety of meanings
depending on the grammatical functions of the particles. This can be illustrated by the following
list of word types using the segmental “be”. All possible meanings of the monosyllable ‘be’, are
listed below. The particle ‘be’ is one of the most productive monosyllables in the language.

  A Rise-Fall contour was originally designated as tone 1. However, as language analysis progressed the tone 1 rise
fall contour turned out to be comprised of a number of contrastive two tone sequences, all with an over all rise fall
pattern, eg ⁶⁻³, ⁷⁻⁸. ⁷⁻⁴ and ⁸⁻⁴.",[6]
"9.2 Iau Content Questions
Content questions are used to obtain unknown information as illustrated in the following
dialogues.
    Du       -i⁸ da -e⁹       bv⁸        bi⁸ taui⁷-e⁹    ba⁹
    wild pig-by bite –Nominlz because of wonder –Nominlz word

    Ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ du-i⁸          da⁹?
    who ID      that wild pig -by eat/bite⁻
    Who was it that got bit/attacked by the wild pig? Eaten/bitten
    Au⁷ to⁴           be⁸du⁷ dui⁹          da⁹? Da⁷ da⁸  i⁷ be⁸du⁷ dui⁹      da⁹?
    He what happened when wild pig –by bite? Dog carry go when wild pig-by bite.
    What was he doing when he got attacked by pig? (be⁸du⁷ interruption in expected flow of
    event)? He was taking his dog out hunting when he was attacked by a pig.
Note that in the examples above, most of the information in the clause is already known /given.
The unknown item indicated by the question becomes the focus, that is the new predicated
information about the topicwhich is the given part of the clause.
The following is a list of content question words in Iau.
    ty⁷⁻⁸              who? (Ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ or Ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸)
    te⁸de⁹             what?
    te⁸du⁷ /te⁸du⁷be⁷  what?
    te⁸be⁸de⁷          what kind of? (class identity of the thing)

                        /what do you say /call –(person/thing)- ?
In general, te⁸ means `what' or `where', ty⁷⁻⁸ means `who' and to⁴ refers to questions about events
‘what happened?’. The other syllables on the end of the question words are various noun and
verb markers which identify the function of the word in the sentence as well as it’s focus status..
Each of the types of question words will be discussed below.",[111]

"5.1.4 COMPOUND VERB PHRASES IN IAU
Iau has several subordinating particles which seem to be operating more on the phrase level than
the clause level. The particle se⁹ which is also a subordinate clause conjunction ‘since’ can also
be used to mark manner as illustrated below.
    Au⁷ a⁷se⁹   di⁹ sa⁸          se⁹            i⁹.
    he SqMkr food eat-Res.Pnc-VPCj-Smlt        go.Tot.Pnc
    He went along eating /OR He ate as he went.
The stative particle de which also is used as a subordinate clause conjunction ‘since, because’
when used with a tone 7 also indicates an accompanying event which could also be marked as
purpose.
    Au⁷ a⁷se⁹   fvy⁶           de⁷ tv⁹.
    he SqMkr bathe-Res.Pnc Sta-VPCj gone.Tot.Pnc
    He has gone bathing (to bathe)
The particle so indicates that the event so marked is terminated prematurely.
    A⁸da⁷ ba⁹ di⁹ dy⁴sy⁷ o⁷                   so⁷          toe⁴              day³.

    You shouldn’t take /receive God’s word for a while and then throw it away.
In the phrases above, the first verb has an adverbial function relative to the second.",[61]
"
5.1.2 THE VERB PHRASE NUCLEUS
The verb phrase nucleus consists of the verb + its aspect tones + an optional stative clitic/affix. +
its tone morphemes as illustrated below.
 +VERB T1      Stative+T²
 Stems  Aspect de +
 compnd tone   Status tone
5.1.2.1 The Verb
As discussed above in the section on verb roots, stems and words, Iau verbs are morphemically
complex. The majority are single syllables. The verb/verb phrase is always clause final. Verbs
are not inherently bitransitive, transitive or intransitive. The number of arguments is contextually
determined which then influences which of the possible lexical choices is to be read in that given
context.",[36]
"3.1.2 Iau Segmental Verb Roots
In an article about Kalam, a Papuan language with a closed set of 90 verbs, Pawley (1987:336-
338) says these 90 verbs are composed of fewer than 30 verb roots, all having very broad or
abstract meanings. These verb roots are strung together in serial verb constructions to comprise
90% of all verbs occuring in Kalam texts. In Kalam, these strings of generic verbs are used to
indicate lexically complex events such as `hunt', `carry', `send to jail'. There are also many
ongoing studies in Southeast Asia concerning the phenomena7 of “complex verbs”, light or
vector verbs, serial verbs etc.
In Iau, monosyllabic segmental verb stems likewise seem to be composed of strings of consonant
and vowel root morphemes which combine to form stems with broad abstract meanings that are
furthur defined from context, from number of arguments for the predicate in the context, and also
by the aspect of the super-imposed aspect tone morphemes. This is illustrated by Iau verbs
formed with the consonant “b”below.
    ‘b’ Motion towards and reaching /acting on a goal /location
    Some of the Iau verbs built from the root“b” +vowel
    ba³ to come (process); to shoot, kill, throw at (a rock at someone)
    ba⁹ come
    be⁹ to paint
    bi³ to arrive
    baui³ to arrive at /reach
    ba⁶ to come to
    da⁸ba⁶ to bring to
    bai⁶ beach /dock a canoe
    bae⁵(sun /light) shine in on
    bu⁵ burn down
    bui⁵ cut down (tree)
    bo⁵ act of moving to a sitting /squatting position on the ground
    boe⁵to lower into a hole, to lower to the ground
Although the individual lexical definitions of these verbs beginning with the consonant ‘b’ vary
widely, note that they all share common spatial and directional motion orientation between the
participants and the action. All the “b” verbs listed above have to do with motion towards a goal
location which results in contact or action on/at that goal-location. The vowels mark various
viewpoints of this action.
For example, in the list above, the verbs be⁹ and ba⁹ /ba³ /ba⁶ all involve a locative relationship
between an object and a goal location, but the vowel ‘e’ has stative qualities. To paint something
involves permanently locating and coating the goal location with the paint. The vowel ‘a’ has a
more generic motion viewpoint, to locate at a place. Both “ba⁹’ and ‘ba³’ involve a moving
object moving towards a goal and locating there. The verb “bi³” is an action that stresses
accomplishment, the total completion of the motion. To have arrived focuses on the completion
of the action of moving towards a goal reaching it and being there. The verb “baui³” to reach a
location is used in travel logs to indicate an intermediate or endpoint goal achieved. The focus is
more on the process of struggle or motion ending in achievement of an intermediate goal to
come/get as far as that location, implying a goal beyond that one, or in some contexts a barely
achieved goal.
The verb ‘ba⁶’ marked with a resultative aspect tone 6 means ‘to have come to’. This is
illustrated more clearly in the compound verb ‘da⁸ba⁶’ to bring s. to a location. The addition of
the more effective action completive viewpoint vowel “i”, forming the verb bai⁶ in a context
where a person is travelling in a canoe, gives the meaning ‘to beach or dock a canoe’ meaning to7
 Note to myself --See the Rice University (Houston Tx) ‘Eleventh Biennial Symposium:
Intertheoretical Approaches to Complex Verb Constructions’ for many interesting papers on this
topic to apply to Iau at some later date and investigate this topic more thoroughly.)                                                                                                 11
put it to shore and tie it up there or to run it aground on the beach. “Bai³ ba⁹” means the sun
comes up. But “Bai³ bae⁵” means the sunshine locates or comes onto something, that is, it shines
in on something.
The list above illustrates how the meaning of the consonants and the vowel(s) interact with the
context and the tone morphemes to indicate which specific meaning should be assigned to the
verb. For example, the verb ba³, ‘to move towards a goal and locate there’ in the context of
hunting or fighting with weapons, means to shoot at and hit something, to kill it. In other
contexts it can mean just to hit as in throwing a rock and hitting the target. However in a more
intransitive context with only a moving object and a location, ‘ba³’ can mean to come (durative
process) as opposed to “ba⁹” come (totality of action, punctual).
The verb ‘bu⁵’ means to burn down. It is a highly effective transitive action, with the agent
totally affecting the undergoer. With the addition of the completive action morpheme “i” and a
telic aspect tone 5, the verb bui⁵ means to cut down /fell a tree. That, is the tree is caused to fall
to the ground/move towards its inevitable and final action endpoint. This is a motion in which
the totally affected undergoer moves to and contacts the goal location, the ground.
The verb ‘bo⁵’ refers to the act of sitting down -usually on the ground or the floor or often in a
squatting position. The person lowers his backside to the floor. (The verb for being seated is a
different verb “b” verb bau⁴de⁹ –a stative verb.) The verb “boe⁵” means to lower something into
a hole, or down to the ground, or to hold out something for someone to see, to demonstrate.
The following charts show the general meanings of Iau consonant and vowel verb roots that
combine to form Iau verb stems.","[11, 12]"
"7.3 Complex Sentences
Complex sentences consist of a combination of dependent clauses (either medial verb clauses,
adverbial subordinate clauses or a combination of the two) and a simple or compound sentence.
The following is an example of a complex sentence formed by a medial verb clause with an
independent clause nucleus.
       Dy⁸ su⁴ da⁸dv⁹
       so died MVCj
       'So when he died,
       ty⁷     ba⁹ dy⁴dau⁴ bi⁸fa⁴

       lets go shoot those other two.""",[105]
"In the first sentence the pronoun a⁹ `I' is topic of the clause and is also the fronted NP. In
example 2 books the undergoer is the topic of the clause
When three or more nouns occur in a clause, they are ordered on a sliding scale of topicality and
definiteness. The topical nouns are placed to the left of nontopical nouns. Definite nouns preceed
indefinite nouns. The question and answer set illustrate this.
         1.Te⁸du⁷be⁷ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸   be⁸    da⁷ bv⁸ da⁸ tv³?
          what        Benjamin Cause dog for carry leave- TOT.DUR
          What was it that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for?
         2.Dai³ du⁷be⁷ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ be⁸ bv⁸ da⁷ da⁸ tv⁹
          cassowary that Benjamin       for dog carry leave-TOT.PUN
          It was a cassowary that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for.
         In each of the sentences above there are three participants involved in the action--
         Benjamin, the dog, and the animal being hunted. In the examples above, the ordering of
         the particle bv⁸ and the noun da⁷ `dog' is reversed. In (1) bv⁸ ‘goal’ occurs after the noun
         da⁷ and in (2) it occurs before `da⁷' dog.
 The first sentence is a question which asks for the identity of the animal being hunted. The
particle `bv⁸' `for (it)' refers to some unknown animal. The noun `da⁷' on the other hand refers to
a specific animal known to the speaker and hearer. Since the noun da⁷ `dog' is definite and the
animal referred to by the particle bv `for (it)' is indefinite, the speaker places the indefinite
particle bv⁸ to the right of the more definite noun da⁷.
In sentence (2) however the identity of the animal hunted is specified as a cassowary. In (2), the
particle bv⁸ now refers to a definite noun, dai³ `cassowary', which is also the sentence topic as
indicated by its position to the far left of the sentence. Because bv⁸ refers to a noun that is both
definite and topical it must preceed the noun da⁷ which is definite but not topical.
The following sentence is another example of a topical noun preceeding a less topical noun.
         Y⁸ da⁶ se⁸ko⁸da⁷ o⁷        da⁸dv⁹ bau⁶              da⁸dv⁹

In the examples above there are several different choices of locations. The `which' question word
te⁸bai⁵ or tebai⁵de⁸dv⁷ is used in situations where the speaker has all of the specific choices in
front of him and wants the hearer to point out which of these choices he is referring to. The
`which' question word te⁸be⁸de⁷ is used when the speaker knows there are several possible
locations but does not know where they all are. For example in (3) above he can't see the place
where the path is and so he asks the hearer to point it out for him.
‘Which’ question words can also be used to ask about the source location of something, ie which
place it is from. The following are some examples.
    1.Di⁹ a⁵ te⁸bai⁴de⁸de⁷?

(For a discussion of the event question word ‘to⁴’ See that section 9.1.10 below.)9.1.6 How Questions
`How' questions are used to elicit procedures. The basic `how' question word in Iau is either
te⁸dau⁴ or te⁸fau⁴. These two question words appear to be interchangeable. The event question
word to⁴ can also be used in Iau to elicit either descriptions or demonstrations of the procedure
for using something. The following are some examples of `how' questions in Iau.

"5.1.3.2 Epistemic Modality:Status and Evidential Particles
Epistemic modality is a sub-type of linguistic modality that deals with a speaker's
evaluation/judgment of, degree of confidence in, or belief in the knowledge upon which a
proposition is based. In other words, epistemic modality refers to the way speakers communicate
their doubts, certainties, and guesses—their ""modes of knowing"".
 Status           Evidential+T² Cl
 Temp Bound +T²
 di,be,ay,a       da+status tone
 dybe+status toneIn Iau following the negative slot in the verb phrase, there is a slot for status particles and after
that a slot for evidential particles. These particles comment on realis properties of the marked
event, the characteristics and degree of definiteness of it’s occurrence, mark the speakers
evaluation of its truth and relationship to common knowledge.
The following are some examples.

Sentences grouped in patterns are used in Iau discourse to organize the information into
semantically related group of events, episodes or paragraphs8.1 Other significant sentence patterns in Iau narrative discourse
Sentence types are also used mark foregrounding versus backgrounding. The sentences marked
by repeated linking clauses illustrated above, are characteristic of non foregrounded /default
chronological sequences of events in Iau narrative.
The following is a sequence of simple sentences from a narrative text. These are foregrounding
structures that often occur at narrative peak, narrative thematic summaries or in narrative
closings. The closing of this travel and hunting narrative is marked by a chain of simple
sentences with no linking clauses, as illustrated below

       We ate and then,
       y⁸ e⁸ta⁸fau⁷ fai⁹fa⁹ba⁴de⁷ ba⁹.

In some styles of narrative discourse, the discourse is organized around intention statements
followed by sequences of sentences beginning with the sentence conjunction dy⁴da⁸dv⁹ ‘and so’
as illustrated below.

The `what' question word te⁸du⁷ consists of the question particle te⁸ and du⁷ a left dislocation as
focus info particle. Te⁸du⁷ is used to ask about the identity of a thing when it is new information
placed in a left dislocated topic position. Normally information in this position would be already
given, not new predicated information. This is in contrast to the previous form te⁸de⁹ which is
used as a predicate in the sentence, the normal location for new predicated information. The
following are some examples.
     1.Bv⁷ te⁸du⁷ du⁷be⁷ ba³?
      this what that come
     What is this that is coming?
     Bv⁷ da⁷ du⁷be⁷ ba³.
      this dog that come
     It's a dog that is coming.
     2.Di⁹ te⁸du⁷ bv⁸ i⁹ a³?
      you what for go Pres Prog
     What (thing) are you going for?
     A⁹ du⁹       bv⁸ i⁹ a³.
      I wild pig for go Pres Prog
     I am going to get a wild pig.
The te⁸du⁷ form of the `what' question word is a abbreviated version of the question markerr
te⁸du⁷be⁷. There are two examples below.
     1.Te⁸du⁷be⁷ di⁹ be⁷   da⁸ bi⁶?
      what      you NMkr carry arrive
     What kind of thing did you bring?
     2.Au⁷ te⁸du⁷be⁷ di³?
      he what        kill
     What kind of thing did he kill?
The question word te⁸be⁸de⁷ means `what kind of/from where' and is usually used in reference to
people to ask what group or race they belong to. It is a description question word. (See also the
section on `Where Questions.) The following question and answer set is an example.
    Ty⁷      te⁸be⁸de⁷ fi⁹su³ o⁷su⁹ davy⁹ a³.
     person what kind pandanus leaf make Habit
    What kind of people make pandanus leaf mats?
    Ty⁷     Da⁸di⁷ fi⁹su³ o⁷su⁹ davy⁹ a³.
     person Dani pandanus leaf make Habit
    The Danis make pandanus leaf fishing mats.
When the generic term is known but the specific identity of the item is unknown, the following
construction is used in Iau to ask about the identity of the item.
    Bv⁷ te⁸ o⁷su⁹ de⁴?
    this what leaf is
    What kind of leaf is this?","[112, 113]"
