"                      15.1. Constituent Order within the ClauseThe most basic Yuki clause can contain just a verb. Clauses can also optionally contain
agent, patient, and dative arguments, adverbs, and obliques. This section describes
constituent order within the clause254. Yuki clauses tend to be verb-final255, but some
variation in word order does occur. (1) - (3) are examples of elicited clauses showing
verb-final word order. Verbs are given in bold in each example clause.",[421]

the adverbial phrase is underlined and the verb in the main clause is given in bold. In
256
      A non-final verb word order is not obligatory for these. See, for example, Origins: 62.

"                                            7.1. OverviewYuki verbs are root-initial and, with the exception of the body prefixes discussed in
§2.2.1.1 and §7.3.2, all inflectional and derivational verb morphology takes the form of
suffixes or enclitics. The boundaries between morphemes in the verb are generally
fairly clear phonologically, though some assimilation and allomorphy is present157.
   Verbs are suffixed with a rich collection of morphology indicating tense, aspect,
mood, transitivity, negation, questions, evidentiality, and dependent clauses. The Yuki
verb has a templatic structure: suffixes are attached to the root in a particular order
relative to each other. Yuki shows no argument marking on the verb itself158. Instead,
arguments are referenced using switch-reference markers159 and/or with actual noun
or pronoun arguments.
                                   7.2. Verb TemplateThe Yuki verb template is shown in Table 17. The template shows the order that verb
morphology takes within a verb. All verb morphology, except for the body prefixes,
follows the verb root and takes the form of either suffixes or enclitics. No verbs exist
with all positions filled on the template. Most verbs have only a few slots filled on the
template. Within serial verb constructions160, verbs can occur as bare roots without any
additional verb morphology.",[247]
"                                       15.9.5.1. HuchnomTo the extent that it is understood, negation in Huchnom appears to function in much
the same way as in Yuki. A negative morpheme -t̯al is added to the verb in order to
negate it. The Huchnom negative -t̯ǝl appears similar in form to the Yuki negatives -ṭan
and ṭal-.
  Contrast the negative sentences in (77) and (78) with the affirmative clause in (79).",[446]

            their subjects as expressed by san and si. So-p is translatable as “and,” also “on

likely due to the fact that all Huchnom and Coast Yuki materials are elicited and no
records of connected speech exist in either language.
                                1 5. CLAUSE STRUCTUREThis chapter describes the major clause types of Yuki253. These include declarative,
predicate nominal, predicate adjective, predicate oblique, question, imperative, and
negative clauses. Dependent clauses, including adverbial and relative clauses, and
complement clauses are also described.
   There exist few earlier descriptions of Yuki syntax. Kroeber (1911:372) presents a
summary of his observations pertaining to syntax and word order. He also presents a
short text in Yuki with his observations of the function and meaning of individual
words, along with these other comments on Yuki syntax. The other main study
pertaining to Yuki syntax is presented by Mithun (2008), who describes Yuki argument
structure.","[419, 420, 421]"

not provide any information on the relative order of morphology attached to the verb

  Arguments can be made for calling Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki dialects of a single
language or separate, but closely related languages. On one hand, they are grammatically very similar
and are thought to have been mutually intelligible (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:211, Golla 2011:188-189). On the
other hand, speakers of Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki inhabited ecologically distinct
territories and differed in terms of their significant ceremonies and myths (see §1.4). It is possible that
the relationships among the Northern Yukian languages were not unlike those among the Scandinavian
languages or Spanish and Portuguese; a group of distinct ethnicities speaking languages of a high degree
of mutual intelligibility. However, this may also be a question that could remain unanswerable due to the
lack of speakers of any of these languages or extant Coast Yuki and Huchnom communities.

  The Huchnom have also been referred to as the “Redwoods,” or by their Pomo appellation Tatu, while
the term Huchnom means “mountain people” (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:202). Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:155)
give a different translation for Huchnom. They connect it with Yuki huč ‘outside’, so that hučnom’ would
mean ‘outside people’. In Lamb’s (1955:27) notes, the pronunciation of “Huchnom” as spoken by his
consultant Lulu Johnson is given as hú̩čnó̩ˀom̥ in Lamb’s orthography or approximately [hutʃnoʔom̥] in
IPA. The [oʔo] segment is a result of the spreading of glottalization of the word-final glottalized sonorant
to the preceding vowel. This is a common process also in Yuki (see Chapter 2), therefore most likely
Huchnom was also pronounced as [hutʃnoʔm] in a form without this spreading. The Coast Yuki referred
to themselves as Ukoht-ontilka ‘ocean people’. (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:212)
4                        University of California Publications in Linguistics   The term “Yuki” has been used to refer to the Northern Yukian languages in general,
but also to the Yuki (Proper) language in particular. In order to avoid confusion, in this
grammar the term “Yuki” is used to refer only to the Yuki (Proper) language, while
Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki are collectively always referred to as
“Northern Yukian.”
   While Wappo is more different from all of the Northern Yukian languages than any
of these languages are from each other, the exact relationship among the three
varieties of Northern Yukian is unclear. Kroeber (1925 [1976]:211) writes that the Coast
Yuki considered their speech to be more similar to that of the Huchnom than that of
the Yuki. This would make a certain amount of sense as the Coast Yuki were
geographically closer to and likely in more frequent contact with the Huchnom than to
the Yuki. However, Kroeber notes that the lexicon of Coast Yuki seems to be about
equally similar to that of Huchnom and Yuki, but that a thorough analysis of the three
Northern Yukian varieties will be necessary before a final determination of internal
relationships can be made. In terms of intelligibility, Kroeber speculates that all three
languages must have been mutually intelligible to some extent, but that a Coast Yuki
unacquainted with either Huchnom or Yuki would not have been able to follow a
conversation fully in either of these languages.","[31, 32]"

      ‘And now the people (lived by) e ating that [those things].’   The extent to which it is possible to verbalize nouns in Yuki is not known; however,
in available data it appears that nouns are not verbalized very often. It is not clear
whether this is because there exist limits in Yuki on the types of nouns that can be used
as verbs or whether all or most nouns can potentially also be used as verbs, but that
doing so would have sounded unusual to Yuki speakers for most nouns. Without the
availability of living speakers of Yuki it is difficult to make a conclusion with certainty
on this point.
   It is worth noting that some very specialized nouns such as kopwok ‘feather dance’
are used as verbs, as in (126). While wok ‘dance, sing’ is used both as a verb and a noun
root in Yuki, in (126) kopwok ‘feather dance’ appears as part of a serial verb construction

determiners, and quantifiers. Demonstratives and quantifiers occurring with human
nouns and some non-human animates are marked with -i. This correlation between
elements of the noun phrase is a reflex of the fact that the noun phrase is a cohesive
unit in Yuki.
   With respect to constituent order, determiners and quantifiers generally precede the
noun within a noun phrase. See §6.1.5-§6.1.7 for examples of determiners in noun
phrases and Chapter 10 for examples of quantifiers in noun phrases. Dative forms of
nouns and pronouns functioning as possessors usually precede the possessed noun.
This can be seen in the examples found in §5.3.2.3 for nouns and Chapter 6 in general
for pronouns. Attributive adjectives and numerals vary in their position with respect to
the noun as discussed in §8.1.1 and §9.3, respectively.
   (127) shows the quantifier hí:li ‘all of them’ and the demonstrative pronoun kimási
‘they’ attached to the dependent clause enclitic =namli in noˀnamlikimási ‘(those) who
lived there’ marked for animacy correlating with mú:s ‘women’.","[170, 171]"

without a defined endpoint. Schlichter (1985:62) reconstructs *-am/_C, CC_~-m/ as the
imperfective aspect marker in PNY. In Yuki, one also encounters these two different
forms for this morpheme: -am and –m, with the latter typically realized as –mi.
However, the environment that Schlichter proposes for this morpheme in PNY does
not describe the distribution in Yuki of –am compared to –m. Instead it appears that
-am is the form which occurs always with future tense179 –paˀ and most often or perhaps
also always with finite180 =mil. –m is most commonly seen before declarative =k and also
before the demonstratives kiˀ and kimas(i) and kiṭ(a) ‘here’ when these are suffixed onto
the verb in order to create a dependent clause. Also, it should be noted that –am and –m
do not co-occur within a single word.
   Also, in the texts and elicited examples, -am and -m seem to alternate within the
same or similar words. In the texts (Origins: 5) Kroeber gives k’ąyyeyami ‘is talking’ as an
alternate form181 for k’ąyyeyimi. For their examples for the verb hąṭ- ‘doctor’, Sawyer
and Schlichter (1984:68) give a form containing -am in the example shown in (45a), but
a form containing -m in (45b).
   In (45a), the matrix clause ‘I like/want to...’ is being used to elicit a bare root or in
this case a root without tense morphology. In this example the matrix clause is creating
a serial verb construction182. In (45b), this same root hąṭ- ‘doctor’ followed by -am is
suffixed with declarative =k yielding a form hą:ṭmek ‘is doctoring’ containing the -m
form of this morpheme instead of -am.","[272, 273]"

of a complement clause is sometimes correlated with a change from the expected verb-
final word order. In (122) the complement clause yím yą:híšti ‘fire blazing up’ occurs
before the verb nąwímil ‘saw’, in the usual position of an argument.","[469, 470]"
"                           6.1.7. Coreferential PronounsThis section describes the coreferential pronouns of Yuki: kip, kipą, kipąt, kimoˀosiyą.                                       6.1.7.1. kip, kipąMithun (2008:7) describes the coreferential agent pronoun kip and patient pronoun kipą
as “used for third person arguments that are coreferential with the subject of their
                                              Pronouns                                   187clause or a higher clause.” Thus far examples have only been found with the
coreferential pronouns kip and kipą referring to agents. However, given that Yuki verbs
can take not just agents, but also patients and possibly also datives, as their primary
arguments, it seems likely that the coreferential pronouns are indeed referencing
subjects rather than specifically agents in the matrix clause. Known examples in
connected speech show kip and kipą referring to previously mentioned arguments, but
it cannot be excluded that these pronouns can refer to arguments that follow it within
the same clause. In (46), kip in Clause 307 refers to ki ˀipsák ‘the boy’ in Clause 306.","[214, 215]"

is represented in the pages that follow, but this work would never have been possible
without the support of such a multitude of individuals.
   First and foremost, as this grammar is based on my doctoral dissertation, I wish to
express my deepest gratitude to the members of my dissertation committee, Marianne
Mithun, Sandy Thompson, Matt Gordon, and Carmen Jany. Their work, support,
counsel, and advice were not only instrumental in writing this grammar, but also to me
personally throughout the years during my graduate studies.
   Marianne Mithun introduced me to the Yuki language. We had previously already
cooperated on research on the Kato language, also spoken in Northern California in the
same region as Yuki. Shortly after that time Marianne suggested the Yuki language to
me as a possible focus for my dissertation. I’m fortunate and deeply grateful to
Marianne for suggesting this topic to me. I’m also deeply thankful for her support not
only during the research and writing of this grammar, but throughout the years of my
graduate studies and since that time. Our thought-provoking conversations on a vast
array of languages for which we both share a passion have meant a great deal to me
and have also helped shape and grow my thinking as a linguist.
   Sandy Thompson is the preeminent authority on the Wappo language, which is the
only well-documented genetic relative of Yuki. During the course of my graduate
studies I had the great fortune to cooperate with Sandy on other research involving the
emergence of language structures in connected speech. When I decided to write my
dissertation on Yuki, it seemed an amazing stroke of luck that I could have Sandy as a
member of my committee and to have the benefit of her advice and knowledge on
language structure and the Yukian languages in particular. I’m grateful and deeply
thankful for this and also for the many wonderful hours I’ve gotten to spend with
Sandy over these years discussing the many linguistic topics for which we share a deep
love.
   Matt Gordon and I both share an interest in the Finnic languages and also the
languages of Northern California. Early in my graduate studies Matt and I cooperated
on research on the prosody of Livonian and other less spoken Finnic languages. At that
time prosody was an entirely new field of linguistic study for me and I’m deeply
grateful to Matt for introducing me to this field and for allowing me to benefit from his
knowledge. Thanks to Matt and the research we cooperated on, I was able to write a
much more in-depth study of Yuki prosody for this grammar. I’m deeply thankful to
xxii                                AcknowledgementsMatt for this knowledge and his support and help over the years.
   Carmen Jany is the author of Chimariko Grammar, which was based on her
dissertation – a study very much like this grammar. Her work laid the foundation for a
great deal of my own thinking of how to approach the task of writing a complete
description of a language based only on archival material and a few recordings. I was
delighted when Carmen agreed to be a member of my committee and in the ensuing
months her insight, advice, and comments proved invaluable in bringing this grammar
to its final form. I’m deeply thankful and grateful to Carmen for all she has done to help
me complete this work.
   I wish to thank the speakers of Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast Yuki, as well as the
researchers who worked with these speakers. All of these individuals deserve a
profound amount of gratitude and appreciation for their labor and cooperation in the
documentation of these languages. In particular I would like to express my
indebtedness for the work of Yuki speaker Ralph Moore and Alfred L. Kroeber, which
yielded the amazing wealth of Yuki language material that allowed for this description
of the Yuki language to be written. Many other researchers have written excellent
studies of aspects of Yuki grammar, but I would express my gratitude and appreciation
in particular to Alice Schlichter-Shepherd for her excellent and insightful work. Yuki
Vocabulary, which she co-authored with Jess Sawyer, her study of Yuki tone, and
reconstruction of Proto-Northern Yukian proved invaluable in the course of the writing
of this grammar.
   I would like to thank Tim Powell and Charles Greifenstein of the American
Philosophical Society and Andrew Garrett, Justin Spence, and John Sylak of the Survey
of California and Other Indian Languages for their help during the course of my
research. I would like to express my gratitude to the American Philosophical Society
and the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages for providing the bulk of the
Yuki language materials I consulted in writing this grammar.
   I would like to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to Carol Genetti for her
teaching and the great amount that I learned from her about language documentation
and description. I would also like to express my thanks and appreciation to Willem de
Reuse for his friendship and for teaching me so much about field linguistics.
   I would like to express my deepest gratitude and indebtedness to Mary Rae Staton,
whose friendship, support, and counsel have meant so much to me during the years of
my graduate studies and since. I would also like to thank Dana Spoonerow, Karen
Barteld, Cami Helmuth, and Ra Thea for their kindness and help over the years. I would
like to thank Alex Walker for providing insight and information on the Southern Pomo

languages in the time we both were students at UCSB and in the years since that time. I
would also like to thank him for his help in finding certain articles and other materials
necessary to me during the editing of this grammar prior to its publication. I would also
like to thank Andrea Berez for her friendship, support, and good sense of humor during
the course of our doctoral studies. I would like to express my appreciation to Andra
Kalnača for the thoughtful insight regarding the wording of the dedication. I would also
like to express my deepest gratitude to Ofelia Zepeda, Leslie Tolbert, and Tapani
Salminen, for their support, friendship, and inspiration from my earliest years as a
linguist.
    My mother, Māra Trapāne, who shares my passion for language and knowledge, has
been a constant support and source of inspiration and encouragement throughout my
life and especially during my years of graduate school. My step-father, Andris Trapāns,
and my father, Agnis Balodis, unfortunately did not live to see the day that I completed
my doctorate, but both served as a model and inspiration to me for the joys of living a
life of the mind. I wish to express my deepest and most heartfelt love and gratitude to
my parents for all of their support and love over the course of my lifetime. I would also
like to thank them for teaching me and for raising me speaking our family’s Latvian
language. Though it is my first language, my initial interest in linguistics came through
my knowledge of Latvian and my fascination in comparing it to English and to its
relatives, Lithuanian and Old Prussian.
    I would also like to express a great measure of thanks to my entire family, both those
related to me by blood and those related to me by the bonds of love and friendship. The
encouragement and love of my husband, Caleb Roehrig, has been amazing and I’m
forever grateful to him for supporting me and being there with me through these
years. I’d also like to especially thank my good friend Dirk C. van Raemdonck whose
friendship, counsel, and insight have been so valuable to me throughout these years
and especially during the writing of this grammar and its subsequent editing. My dear

                                 1 . INTRODUCTIONUntil relatively recently, Yuki and the other Northern Yukian languages, Huchnom and
Coast Yuki, were spoken in Mendocino County in Northern California. This grammar is
based primarily on spoken narratives recorded in the first decade of the twentieth
century and therefore provides a description of the Yuki language as it was spoken at
that time.
   The narratives were provided by Yuki speaker Ralph Moore and recorded by Alfred
Kroeber. Supplemental examples were drawn from the large base of elicited material by
various other researchers over the course of the twentieth century. Where possible
information is also included on Huchnom and Coast Yuki, which together with Yuki
constitute the Northern Yukian languages, but which are far less extensively
documented than Yuki Proper. This was done to generate grammatical sketches of
Huchnom and Coast Yuki, and also to show how the Northern Yukian languages
compared to each other.
   Each chapter of this grammar addresses a different aspect of Yuki or its speakers.
Chapter 1 describes the genetic affiliation of Yuki, the location where it was spoken,
and information on dialect differences. Historical information on the Yuki people and
the consultants is also given in this chapter, along with a grammatical sketch of Yuki
and descriptions of the data, practical Yuki orthography, and past work on the
Northern Yukian languages. Chapter 2 explains the phonetics and phonology of Yuki.
The phonetic inventory, allophonic variation, and prosodic system of Yuki are
discussed. Chapter 3 details morphophonemic alternations. Chapter 4 gives an
introduction to information on word classes described in more detail in later chapters.
Chapter 5 covers Yuki argument structure and noun morphology. Chapter 6 describes
Yuki pronouns and associated morphology. Chapter 7 details Yuki verb morphology.
Chapter 8 describes Yuki adjectives. Chapter 9 discusses the Yuki numeral system.
Chapter 10 describes Yuki quantifiers. Chapter 11 covers Yuki adverbs. Chapter 12
discusses Yuki locative terms. Chapter 13 describes Yuki connectives and also a
selection of other minor words. Chapter 14 details the Yuki system of switch-reference
marking and coordinating suffixes. Chapter 15 is a description of Yuki clause structure.
   This grammar came about as a result of a dinner conversation and a great amount of
good fortune. Marianne Mithun suggested Yuki to me as a topic of study one evening at
a department dinner, while I was a graduate student at the University of California,
Santa Barbara. I went on a search motivated by my great interest in discovering all I
                                           1
2                        University of California Publications in Linguisticscould about Yuki and also by this quote found in Yuki Vocabulary authored by Jess
Sawyer and Alice Schlichter:       Unfortunately, the large collection of Yuki made by Alfred L. Kroeber is still
       unavailable and unpublished. Any analysis of Yuki grammatical structure must
       wait upon the availability of that material (Sawyer and Schlichter 1984:2)From this quote I knew that somewhere the materials existed to make my work
possible. In due course I discovered the location of these materials and started on the
journey to write a grammatical description of the Yuki language. This grammar came to
completion approximately a century after the publication of Kroeber’s original 1911
sketch of Yuki in The languages of the coast of California north of San Francisco.
   During the course of this work I found that as a result of a great coincidence, I wrote
large portions of this grammar only a few blocks away from the location where some of
the original narratives were recorded over a century ago. In his description of the
history of his work with Yuki, which I have included in the appendix of this grammar,
Kroeber states that he worked with Yuki speaker Ralph Moore in Covelo located in
Round Valley in Northern California, but that Moore would also come to San Francisco
to work with him. At the beginning of the Wildcat and Coyote Myth, Kroeber gives an
address in San Francisco (443 Eddy Street) as the location where these materials were
recorded. During research trips up to the University of California, Berkeley, I stayed
and wrote several chapters at a hostel in the historic Hotel Virginia near the corner of
Mason and O’Farrell in San Francisco, which happened to be located just a few blocks
away from this location given by Kroeber.

While -s-il is among the sequences discussed by Kroeber and shown in Table 22, -n-il is
not. Both of these examples describe the action of shaving, presumably oneself, which
is an inherently reflexive kind of action. Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:185) define the
verb root ṭ’ąk’- as ‘shave, bald’. There are no available examples of ṭ’ąk’- without
mediopassive -il, thus it is difficult to know for certain whether or not mediopassive -il
is indeed being used in these verbs in order to give them a reflexive meaning. However,
given the use of -il with other verb aspect morphemes it is plausible that indicating a
reflexive action is indeed the function of -il in these examples.","[319, 320]"

"                               1 .6.3. Underlying formsSawyer and Schlichter’s Yuki Vocabulary contains modern transcriptions of a large
number of words spoken by Minnie Fulwider and Arthur Anderson during elicitation
sessions. Elicited forms are less likely to display sound changes, such as phonetic
reduction, characteristic of quick speech. For this reason elicited forms from Yuki
Vocabulary were generally used as the underlying forms for noun and verb roots as well
as other independent words for the morphemic analyses present throughout this
grammar. The term “modern transcription” refers to the orthography attributed to
Sawyer and Schlichter in Table 1 in §1.6.5, which is almost identical to the orthography
used in this grammar. Thus, for example, hąˀąye ‘now’ from Yuki Vocabulary is used as
the underlying form for hą́ye (OG:6) and hą́ˀye (OG:7).
   For verb and noun roots or independent words not present in Yuki Vocabulary, the
underlying form is typically the same as the surface form or the more frequent form
when such a root or word occurs repeatedly in the texts. Underlying forms for noun
and verb morphology were generally left as they appeared in the data. Some preference
was at times given to the form some morphemes took in Yuki Vocabulary. For example,
the underlying form of the inchoative is given as -ląm, which is the form it takes in Yuki
Vocabulary, rather than -lam, which is the form it generally takes in the words recorded
by Kroeber.
   In some cases suffixes may have had differing forms, but there was good reason to
pick one form over the other as the underlying form. For example, for the past tense
suffix -wi ~ -u it was clear from the description of Yuki in Kroeber (1911) as well as
analysis of the behavior of this suffix in the texts in Appendix 10 that -wi and -u were
indeed two forms of the same suffix. As -wi appeared to be a fuller form of this suffix, it
                                                 Introduction                             27was selected as the underlying form. Therefore, the final morpheme in nąnákwi ‘knew’
and tíweyu ‘pursued’ (both from CW:177) is given as -wi when analyzed.
   When in the course of the research for this grammar a phonological process was
observed further highlighting the nature of underlying forms, this observation was
taken into account in order to refine underlying forms. For example, as discussed in
§2.1.1.8.8.1, root-final glottalization and root-final glottal stops will often spread to the
preceding vowel resulting in a VʔV sequence. This VʔV sequence is often observed in
verbs containing the root wok’- ‘sing, dance’. In Sawyer and Schlichter (1984) this root is
given without final glottalization as wok. However, given that VʔV and even root-final
glottalization is seen in verbs with this root, such as wóˀoksikiṭ ‘while dancing’ (CW:135)
and wáˀok’esmil ‘(they) danced’ (FD:21), it seemed likely that the underlying form of this
root ended in an ejective. For this reason it is given as wok’ in this grammar.
   Occasionally, one encounters sporadic glottalization or glottal stops for reasons
which are not known. An aspect of this phenomenon is discussed in §2.1.1.8.2. At this
point this phenomenon does not seem to be linked to any difference in meaning and
may have been characteristic of a style of speaking in Yuki. It is encountered both in
the speech of Frank Logan, as in miṭóˀk ‘joints’, and Ralph Moore, as in hoč’k ‘is big’
(Kroeber 1901a:37), šą́:kč’am ‘sometimes’ (FD:22), and hą́lamuˀ ‘just heard’ (CW:18). These
segments are not included in the morphemic analysis line or underlying forms.
   Similarly, as discussed in §3.4, the insertion of epenthetic [i] or [e] is common in
Yuki. These vowels also are not included in the morphemic analysis line or in
underlying forms.","[54, 55]"
"94
   The term ‘clitic’ is used throughout this description to refer to morphemes which 1) attach to a
constituent composed of smaller constituents, such as a noun phrase, verb phrase, or clause; 2) can
attach to words of more than one word class; and/or 3) act as independent words in some circumstances
(e.g. the noun case enclitic =mik’al ‘around’ can be affixed with verb morphology and used as a verb). If
behavior matching these criteria is not observed for an ending, then it is not assumed to be a clitic even
if other similar endings in like contexts or positions can be defined as clitics. So, for example, some but
not all verb morphemes in Position XI shown in the Yuki verb template in Table 17 in §7.2 are identified
as clitics, because clitic-like behavior matching the criteria identified above was not observed for all of
these morphemes even though they occur in the same position in the verb template.

adjectives, adverbs, quantifiers, locative terms, numerals, switch-reference markers,
and connectives. There is overlap between some of these word classes. Nouns can be
verbalized through the addition of verb morphology and some noun case endings can
be added to verbs. Third person pronouns are effectively identical to distal
demonstratives91. Unlike adverbs, adjectives can be marked with =(ˀ)a(ˀ). Switch-
reference markers can also be understood as a type of connective.
   Yuki is an agglutinating and almost exclusively suffixing language. Unique
possessive prefixes are used for kinship terms92 and a series of possibly frozen prefixes
referring to parts of the body is found in nouns and verbs93. Verbs and nouns are the
most complex classes morphologically.","[111, 112, 113]"

   Bauer (2009:102) records an episode relayed to him concerning the use of Yuki as a
form of resistance against Euro-Americans in Round Valley. Bauer does not give the
exact date of this episode, though it likely would have occurred between around 1875
and 1935. Bauer writes:       Kinship ties only went so far in protecting Round Valley Indians from economic
       exploitation, and sometimes other, subtler, forms of resistance were necessary.
       Pomo Elizabeth Willits remembered that every evening during the hop-picking
       season storeowner Edward Gravier drove his wagon to Round Valley’s Hop
       Ranch and sold meat, vegetables, and watermelons to Indian workers when the
       day’s work was concluded. On one occasion, Dixie Duncan told Gravier that in
       order to boost sales he should yell out in the Yuki language, “I’m bringing good
       meat. Come and get it.” However, Duncan actually taught Gravier to say, “I’m
       bringing rotten meat. Come and get it.” Gravier, of course, did not understand
       the Yuki language or, perhaps, the chuckles and declining sales he encountered
       thereafter. For Duncan, though, this was a safe way to make Gravier look like a
       heel and to resist economic domination. Duncan obviously felt comfortable
       enough to use the Yuki language to poke fun at someone who could charge
       usurious rates for meat and other groceries by entering the Yuki language into
       what James Scott calls the “public transcript.” Duncan attempted to cause
       people to not buy groceries from Gravier but did so in a way that meant
       everyone - perhaps even Gravier when he discovered the ruse - could have a
       good laugh, at Gravier’s expense.","[50, 51]"
"                                     2.2.1.1. Primary StressThe domain of primary stress is the root of the Yuki word. Primary stress typically
occurs in the initial syllable of the root, though some variation is seen for words
containing roots of more than syllable63. As Yuki is primarily a suffixing language, the
root is usually the first syllable of the word, regardless of word class. Suffixes and
enclitics do not alter the position of stress, thus primary stress is typically found in the
initial syllable of a word. Examples of words with primary stress falling on the initial
syllable are shown in (31a) and (31b) 64.(31a) ˀąp       lák.t̯u

was apparently partly his own creation. Aspects of this orthography, such as marking
ejective consonants using <!> or indicating stressed syllables with an acute accent are
based on transcription conventions used around the beginning of the twentieth
century. Kroeber had been a student of Boas during his years at Columbia University
(Steward et al 1961:1043) and indeed Kroeber’s transcription style bore a resemblance
to the Boas transcription conventions. However, in transcribing Yuki, Kroeber
incorporated other vowel diacritics that I was not able to define based on any existing
transcription convention from that period (i.e. 1900-1903). In his notes, the following
are the only definitions Kroeber gives for the vowel diacritics used by him:Kroeber (1901b:37):           sot    cut
                              sōt    scratched (with finger-nails)
                              The ō here has a peculiar quality, like inter-
                              mediate between â and ō and nearly shortKroeber (1902a:13a):          ŏ close
                              o openKroeber (1902b:1a):           ò = the sound between â and ō
                              ì= ”      ”      ” ī and è
                              î= ”      ”      ” i and e)   In reviewing the Yuki language materials I obtained from the American
Philosophical Society, I found three different transcribed versions of the Wildcat and
Coyote myth. The later versions after Kroeber’s initial 1902 version are attributed in the
APS document index to Hans Uldall who collaborated with Kroeber on Yuki for a time.
Of the these two later versions of Wildcat and Coyote, the second version includes only
part of this myth. However, this portion corresponds word-for-word to the original
version of the myth recorded by Kroeber in 1902, but is written in a more IPA-like
transcription. The third version of the myth is written in two different transcriptions.
The first of these is very IPA-like, while the second portion is more reminiscent of that
found in the second version. This third version differs from the other two in its content
and appears to be the record of a different telling of the Wildcat and Coyote myth.
                                             Introduction                                           31   As these later versions, especially the second version which corresponds in content
exactly to Kroeber’s original recording of Wildcat and Coyote, provide a point of
comparison and therefore a key to Kroeber’s symbols, I did the logical thing and
performed word-by-word comparisons to unlock the meaning of Kroeber’s mysterious
vowel diacritics. However, it should be noted that due to the incomplete nature of the
second version of Wildcat and Coyote, only a relatively small-scale word-to-word
comparison was possible.
   My suspicion based on Kroeber’s own fragmentary description of the meaning of the
diacritics quoted above was that Kroeber was marking differences in vowel quality with
these diacritics. Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:11) note that vowels in Yuki differ in
quality depending on whether they occurred in stressed or unstressed syllables.
   A perfect correspondence did not emerge between Kroeber’s use of vowel diacritics
and Uldall’s transcription. In some cases Kroeber appears to hear variants that Uldall
does not note at all. However, comparison between the different versions of the Wildcat
and Coyote myth allowed for a likely meaning, if only in a general way, to be found for
most of Kroeber’s vowel diacritics.
   Kroeber’s diacritics include macrons written over single vowels or sequences of
vowels, acute accents written over vowels or more generally over syllables, grave
accents written over <o> or <i> (ò, ì), a double-underline written under <a> (a͇). Rare
symbols include <a> and <i> with circumflex (â, î) and <a>, <i>, <o>, and <u> with breve
(ă, ĭ, ŏ, ŭ) as well as nonce uses of diacritical marks with vowels where they are
generally not expected according to Kroeber’s pattern of use.
   The macron most likely is an indicator of higher tone. Perceived differences in tone
have been noted in transcription of Yuki also by later researchers. Comparing Kroeber’s
original 1902 version of Wildcat and Coyote with the second version of this myth shows a
frequent correlation between syllables with macrons and syllables marked for high
tone in this later transcription. The macron does not appear to be connected with the
marking of vowel length.
   It should be noted that as indicated in Kroeber’s notebooks and detailed above, at
least for a time he used <ō> to write a vowel that he perceived as having a quality
difference from other vowels34. Still, the general correspondence of the macron to
34
  Langdon (1994:173) describes Kroeber’s transcription of Mojave and Diegueño and his use of macrons
as well as acute and grave accents. Her description supports the theory that Kroeber used macrons and
grave accents as markers of vowel quality also in Yuki: “It turns out that the macron for Kroeber means
not only length, but simultaneous “close” pronunciation, while the grave accent means the vowel is long
and “open”. Kroeber indicates stress in Mojave by the acute accent following the stressed vowel.”
32                        University of California Publications in Linguisticshigher tone in later transcriptions and Kroeber’s writing of these macrons over not just
single vowels but also over sequences of vowels, gives the impression that in large part
the macron was used by Kroeber to indicate a feature, such as tone, that existed on the
level of the entire syllable.
   The acute accent most likely is used to mark stress. This correlation is fairly
convincing, in that in words where non-initial primary stress is expected, such as
compounds, for example ˀu:khóṭ ‘ocean’ (literally ˀuk’ ‘water’ + hoṭ ‘large’ OG:75 (RM)), or
words beginning with body prefixes, for example ną:nákmil ‘know’ OG:79 (RM), the
syllable, which would be expected to have primary stress is marked with an acute
accent by Kroeber.
   Comparing the 1902 transcription of the Wildcat and Coyote myth to the later
transcriptions, syllables marked with an acute accent also seem to correspond to some
extent to syllables marked for higher tone in the later transcriptions of this myth. If the
acute accent marks stress, then this would not be entirely surprising, as higher f0
correlates with stress in Yuki (see §2.2.1.3). It should be noted that there also exist
words in the 1902 version of the Wildcat and Coyote myth where both the macron and
acute accent are written over the same sequence of vowels. This co-occurrence
suggests that these symbols are not marking the same feature. The closer
correspondence of the acute accent to the expected position of primary stress in Yuki
words suggests that the acute accent is most likely being used to mark this feature.
   Complications for this analysis of the acute accent arise from unexpected or
inexplicable uses of the acute accent. These include monosyllables marked with an
acute accent and also disyllables with both syllables marked with acute accents. If the
acute accent marks stress, then it is unclear why it would be necessary to include this
mark on monosyllables or why it would appear on both syllables of a disyllable. These
are puzzling. One possible explanation could be that these are the result of the
circumstances in which Kroeber was first recording these texts. Perhaps as he was
writing these texts he marked qualities that he heard in that moment, which later on
he would not have considered important.
   The clearest correspondence comes for the two grave accent-marked vowels: ò, ì. In
the excerpt from Kroeber’s notes cited above, the grave accent is used to indicate
differences in vowel quality for these two vowels. Comparing the 1902 version of the
Wildcat and Coyote myth to the later transcriptions, a slightly different analysis emerges
with ò written as <ɔw> in the later transcriptions and ì corresponding to a [j] off-glide.
   Similarly, â, î, and ŏ indicate vowels with a unique vowel quality, based on Kroeber’s
notes cited above. This is likely also the case for ă, ĭ, and ŭ as well as other vowels
                                         Introduction                                    33occasionally and sporadically marked with these or similar diacritics. This seems the
most likely hypothesis based on the pattern of use of these diacritics in general in
Kroeber’s notes.
   The most mysterious of all of these symbols is <a> with a double-underline (a͇). No
clear interpretation could be found for this symbol. It does not correspond consistently
to a tonal difference. It occasionally seems to correspond to /ą/ when not otherwise
marked by Kroeber. Even more occasionally it appears to correspond to a difference in
vowel quality, but not consistently so. Therefore, it is not clear at this time what
feature Kroeber was marking with this double underline.
   Ultimately, I chose not to incorporate Kroeber’s additional vowel diacritics into my
practical Yuki orthography, as no other linguists who have written about Yuki have
ever found the need to do this. This includes Alice Schlichter-Shepherd who studied
Yuki intensively and described its phonology (Sawyer and Schlichter 1984, Schlichter
1985). Additionally, Wildcat and Coyote is the only example of connected speech to have
been previously published. It appears with Kroeber’s 1911 grammatical sketch. In his
published version of this myth, even Kroeber does not include any of the vowel
diacritics he used in his fieldnotes.
   There is some uncertainty as to the pronunciation of double vowels in Kroeber’s
transcription. These symbols often represent long vowels, but sometimes they are
[VʔV] sequences. Since [V:] often results from [VʔV] in Yuki, as discussed in §2.1.1.8.8, it
may be that for many sequences of double vowels either pronunciation was possible.
   An intervocalic glottal stop is assumed for sequences of two vowels when these do
not form a known diphthong or are shown by Kroeber to have differing vowel quality.
An example of this would be the second person plural agent pronoun as in moˀos. In
Kroeber’s notes, he frequently writes this pronoun as mòos. Knowing that <ò>
corresponds to <o> with a slightly different vowel quality or to [ɔw], it is clear that
when so transcribed this word would not be realized as [mo:s] and indeed later
researchers records this pronoun as moˀos. Therefore, a glottal stop is inserted in such
cases even if not written by Kroeber in his orthography. Also, some words, such as
hulk’oˀi ‘coyote’ are often written by Kroeber without a glottal stop between <o> and <i>.
Records collected by later researchers show a glottal stop in this position and the later
transcriptions of Wildcat and Coyote also show this glottal stop even when it is not
written by Kroeber in the original recording of this myth. Therefore, for such words a
glottal stop is assumed in a position where subsequent work has shown it to have been
there. Additionally, a glottal stop is written at the start of all vowel-initial words even
34                      University of California Publications in Linguisticsthough this was not the practice in the transcription used by Kroeber or some of the
other researchers whose data is included in this grammar.
   The Yuki practical orthography I use in this grammar is essentially the same as that
used by Sawyer and Schlichter (1984). The main difference is that I incorporate
Kroeber’s marking of stress, as stressed and unstressed vowels are phonetically
different (1984:11). Table 1 shows a comparison of the orthography used in this
grammar, given under Balodis, with other relevant Yuki orthographies and the IPA
equivalent of each symbol. Lamb’s orthography is used in his documentation of
Huchnom. Uldall, Lamb, and Siniard also mark prosodic contours in their
orthographies, but this marking is not reproduced in the examples given in this
grammar. Examples from Harrington’s study of Coast Yuki are also included in this
grammar, but the orthography in those examples is not altered from that in the
original. It should be noted that in the Coast Yuki examples in this grammar, <æ>
appears extremely similar to <œ> when italicized. However, as Coast Yuki does not have
a vowel [œ], in all cases this character represents the vowel [æ].
   Blank spaces indicate that a symbol for a particular sound was not observed. In the
examples used throughout this grammar, which are drawn from Kroeber’s work with
Ralph Moore, it was generally not possible to determine reliably whether <t>
represented /t̯/ or /ṭ/. Therefore when such a determination could not be made, words
written with <t> in Kroeber’s notes are also written as <t> in the examples in this
grammar.

   Uldall does not use <e> in his transcription of Yuki.

   Vi and Vu are indicating <i> or <u> following a vowel other than <i> or <u>.
38
   This vowel used by Kroeber is an allophone of Yuki /o/, but its equivalent in IPA is unclear.
39
   There is some uncertainty about the pronunciation of double vowels in Kroeber’s transcription. These
segments often are long vowels, but sometimes are [VʔV] sequences. Since [V:] often results from [VʔV]
in Yuki, as discussed in §2.1.1.8.8.1, it may be that for many of sequences of double vowels either
pronunciation was possible.
                                        Introduction                                     37                         1 .7. Brief Grammatical OverviewYuki has 25 consonants and 5 vowels. Plain and glottalized variants are distinguished
for nearly all consonants, except the sibilant /š/ and of course the glottal consonants
/h/ and /ʔ/. /w’/ and /s’/ are marginal phonemes. Unlike in the neighboring Pomoan
languages aspiration and voicing are not contrastive for stops. Vowel length is either
not phonemic or only very marginally phonemic. One nasalized vowel phoneme /ą/
also exists in Yuki.
   Stress in Yuki is non-contrastive and predictable. Stress occurs on the first syllable of
the stem (Mithun 1999:574). The most noticeable correlate of stress in Yuki is a very
high pitch on the syllable with primary stress and a mid to high pitch on the syllable
with secondary stress (Schlichter 1978, Sawyer and Schlichter 1984:11). Yuki phonetics,
phonology, and prosody are discussed in Chapter 2.
   Yuki is primarily suffixing and is a primarily agglutinating language. Grammatical
relations in Yuki are marked on pronouns and with case-marking on some nouns.
Grammatical relations are not marked on verbs in Yuki. The grammatical relations
system of Yuki is organized according to an agent/patient pattern. Yuki argument
structure is discussed in §5.2. Yuki pronouns are discussed in Chapter 6.
   Nouns functioning as grammatical patients are marked with a unique case enclitic
=ą, while grammatical agents are unmarked (Mithun 2008:302). Generally only human
nouns are marked for core cases, though non-human animates can also show this
marking from time to time. Yuki nouns can also be marked for location, and several
other categories. Number is marked only for a handful of human nouns. In addition,
unique possessive morphology is used with kinship terms. Yuki noun morphology is
discussed in Chapter 5. Kinship possessive morphology is discussed in §6.1.9.
   A noteworthy characteristic of the Yuki verb system is that it contains a large
number of TAM suffixes. Kroeber (1911:370) characterizes the structure of Yuki verbs as
being root-initial, followed by one or two derivational suffixes with tense or modal
suffixes coming at the end of the verb. The derivational suffixes look for the most part
to be functioning as markers of different types of aspect, for example distinguishing
actions that are iterative, habitual, semelfactive, or moving in a particular direction
(1911:359). The tense and modal suffixes do seem to be exactly that, distinguishing
categories such as past and future time, as well as imperative and interrogative moods
of the verb (1911:362). Yuki verb morphology is discussed in Chapter 7.
   Yuki is one of the few languages in California to possess an octonary numeral system
(1911:368). However, in his ethnography of the Native Californians, Kroeber (1925
38                      University of California Publications in Linguistics[1976]:176-7) notes that already at the time he was documenting the existence of this
system in Yuki, it was falling out of use among younger speakers who apparently no
longer realized that their grandparents were counting in multiples of eight rather than
multiples of ten. The Yuki numeral system is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.
   Another interesting characteristic of Yuki is that it utilizes a system of switch-
reference markers to track topic between clauses. In addition, a rich variety of other
connective enclitics is used following the switch-reference markers to indicate other
types of relationships between clauses. The Yuki switch-reference system is described
in Chapter 14.
   Yuki clauses are generally verb-final, though other word orders are also observed.
Dependent clauses are formed either through the use of the dependent clause enclitic
=namli, which typically is further encliticized with demonstratives, or through the use
of serial verb constructions. Yuki clause types and strategies for forming dependent
clauses are discussed in detail in Chapter 15.

                       Appendix 5: Kroeber’s “History of the Recording of Yuki”         457   I slipped, or had slipped for me, the data on the Yuki language in the following years,
and worked on it as I could, but there were many languages and cultures needing
attention in California.
   In 1910 I visited Round Valley for the U.S. Census and spent two days in the
Superintendent’s office with Ralph Moore, which showed chiefly that many of the
tribal attributions entered in the Government books in the 1860’s were quite random,
but that they had been passed on to children and grandchildren.
   In 1911 I published a section on Yuki (pp. 345-383) in The Languages of the Coast of
California North of San Francisco, as no. 3 of volume 9 of the American Archaeology
and Ethnology series of University publications. For a preliminary report, the
morphology is not bad, but the phonological underpinning is weak.
   I had also arranged with Boas for a contribution to the Handbook of American Indian
Languages, of which the first volume also appeared in 1911; but I had asked to be
released. The Handbook consisted of studies some of which were final and all of which
had had far more time expended on them than I had been able to give Yuki. My account
of it as published in Berkeley was one of a group of preliminary reports - some of them
quite brief sketches; it would have been out of setting in the context of matured
grammars by Goddard, Swanton, Boas, Dixon, Jones, and Thalbitzer.
   There is one statement on page 370 of the 1911 exposition which it seems pertinent
to withdraw and deny explicitly. It is to the effect that the study of Yuki offers less than
expectable difficulty “on account of the scarcity of phonetic changes in derivation and
suffixation.” This was said before morphophonemics had been discovered; but the
highly complex and subtle morphophonemic interactions of Yuki might have been
recognized then, under another designation, if I had been better able to hear the tones
and glottalizations of the language.
   About this period, I learned from Goddard of the kymograph tracings devised by
Rousselot, one of whose brass machines Goddard had persuaded President Wheeler to
acquire for the University. Between 1911 and 1914 I published on Mohave, Diegueño,
and Marshall Micronesian phonetics and mode tracings of Papago and other languages.
Later I realized that these visible renderings of speech could not replace properly
trained hearing as a foundation, and that Sapir was right in his view that they might
serve, like a crutch, in an emergency, but not as a basic method of development of
understanding. I think now - after some recent preoccupation with Goddard’s
Athabascan materials - that Goddard’s hearing was fairly sensitive, but remained
unsure; and I know that I was unsure, and not only about Yuki. At any rate, in 1912, I
had Ralph Moore down to the University again, and recorded some 50 sheets of tracings
458                      University of California Publications in Linguisticsof Yuki, each bearing perhaps 25 to 50 word tracings. I also had a dentist’s palate made
to fit Ralph’s mouth and used it by dusting with powdered soapstone.
    In 1923 I had Ralph at the University once more and this time went over my whole
slip catalog of the morphemes of the language, writing on the slips in new green ink
what I then heard. This rendering was maturer than before: I recognized durations an
breaths pretty satisfactorily, glottal stops and effects better than previously, and might
have worked out a rather adequate proto-phonemic system had I not remained deaf to
the tones.
    It may have been at this time that Lowie dropped in where I was working with Ralph,
listened a while, heard tones, and convinced me.
    At any rate, in May 1927, I was back at the kymograph with Ralph running it this
time at high speed to stretch out the voice vibrations so that the number of them = per
inch or centimeter might be counted and the pitch of vowel be ascertained objectively.
Again, a case of unsureness, not trusting myself to learn to recognize such tones as
there might be - after which the measured counts might have had confirmatory value -
I again leaned on the machine to make decisions for me. Quite properly for my pains, I
did a lot of counting and measuring with mainly inconclusive results. The most distinct
pitch profile that emerged from the counts was a rising one! And its few occurrences do
not coincide in their distribution with any take of Uldallian stem tone.
   During the same summer of 1927, Fang-Kuei Li, thru a student of Sapir’s at Chicago
was studying Athabascan Mattole in the county adjoining that in which Round Valley
Reservation and Covelo are situated. His publication Mattole, an Athabascan Language
appeared in 1930. He had, in the same summer of 1927, some briefer experiences with
two other Athabascan languages: Hupa, which Sapir was then studying at Hoopa, and
Wailaki, on Round Valley Reservation. At Sapir’s request, he undertook to see if any
Yuki were available, and to report on the tones. Ralph Moore seems to have been away,
and Li did not connect with Eben Tillotson whom George Foster worked with on culture
a few years later, and whom I saw at Hull’s Valley on a brief visit made with Frank
Essene in the summer of 1938. Li did secure material from two informants, [blank]
and [blank]
   The next effort was through Hans Uldall, the Danish linguist trained by Jones the
British phoneticist. He was in the country on a fellowship from the Committee on

years, during which time Uldall lived in Berkeley, except when off in the back country
with Indian informants. He worked on Maidu, supplementing Dixon’s study; also on
Achomawi and perhaps other California languages, in collaboration with Jaime de
                      Appendix 5: Kroeber’s “History of the Recording of Yuki”     459Angelo and L.S. Freeland. He agreed, with Boas’ consent, to detach himself temporarily
from these commitments and do what he could to put the Yuki house of tones in order.
Ralph Moore again came down to the University, and the three of us began work in
1931. But Ralph had a cough and felt unwell; we had him examined; the report was
tuberculosis and diabetes. We persuaded him to enter a Sanitarium which the Bureau of
Indian Affairs maintained in the Sierra Nevada. So the quest was checked once more.
   Ralph’s health definitely improved, and in 1932 he returned for a renewed stay at
Berkeley, which lasted [blank]

Coast Yuki. There are a few verbs in these word lists, which were included due to their
relevance to the describing the environment of the home territory of the Coast Yuki.
   The Coast Yuki, as their name suggests, lived along the coast. The terms in (1)
describe the ocean and the coast.","[484, 485, 486, 487, 488]"

77
   Longer roots may exist; however longer words in Yuki are often the product of compounding or are
formed through suffixation of derivational morphemes.
78
   CV noun roots, such as ti: ‘tea’ (MF), do exist, but are likely borrowings.
79
   The words compiled in Sawyer and Schlichter’s (1984) dictionary date from all periods of Yuki language
documentation.
80
   Verb roots can exist as independent words in Yuki. For example, ṭuˀ ‘push over’ in ṭuˀ i: ha:mik ‘I like to
push things over’ yiˀ ‘play’ in yiˀ i: ha:mik ‘I like to play’ (Siniard 1967b:99,100).
                                         Phonetics and Phonology                                       71    Other examples support this analysis. For example, šuˀ- ‘sit, stay’ (AA, MF) shows the
VʔV sequence characteristic of the spreading of root final glottalization in the
accompanying form šuˀuhek ‘sitting’81 (MF). Similarly, while only t’u:- ‘rain’ (AA, MF) and
not t’uˀ- is given in Sawyer and Schlichter (1984), the accompanying sentence t’uˀuwičk
‘it rained’ (MF) shows the same VʔV sequence suggesting the presence of a final glottal
stop in the root of ‘rain’ as well.
    Therefore, it is possible that there truly are no CV verb roots at all, as, at least in
existing data these seem to invariably end in a phonetic long vowel and therefore are
possibly concealing an underlying final glottal consonant. However, there is a
complicating factor to this conclusion. This is that word stress correlates strongly with
vowel duration. Thus, in some of these cases it may be that vowel length in a CV verb
root is just a result of stress rather than an assimilated glottal stop.
    CV noun roots pose a similar problem. Some CV noun roots ending in a phonetic
long vowel are also documented as having a form ending in /h/. Thus, for example,
‘hole’ is documented as nih (AA, MF) but appears as ni: in this example where it is
followed by inessive –k’e, ni:k’e kaptek ‘he put it into the hole’ (AA); t’u: ‘heart’ (AA) also
appears as ṭ’u(h) (MF). CVʔ noun roots often occur also as CVʔV, for example siˀ ‘clover’
(MF) and siˀi (MF)82. No CV noun roots have been found so far where CVʔ yields an
alternate CV: form. However, since the VʔV ~ V: alternation is common, it is certainly
possible that such forms may have existed.
    Thus, it is currently not possible to conclude with absolute certainty that there are
truly no CV noun or verb roots. The first person plural inclusive agent pronoun mi
which often appears as mi: and the second person singular agent pronoun miˀ which
often appears as miˀi show that there is at least a single word in Yuki, the first person
plural inclusive agent pronoun mi, which is CV83. Therefore, it can be said that at least
CV words are possible in Yuki and so there is always a chance that there also may have
been as yet undiscovered or unknown true CV noun and verb roots. However, at this
time it seems that in Yuki and all vowel-final noun and verb roots actually end in a
glottal consonant or alternatively that there are true CV verb roots alongside those
that are CVʔ or CVh.
    There are CVCV verb roots attested with the most common being the verb ˀimi- ‘say’.
However, most other CVCV verb roots are likely CVC or CVCVC roots for different
81
   The full example is: ka ˀąp ˀonk’e ša:tk’e šuˀhek ‘I’m sitting here on the cold ground.’
82
   This example is taken from Siniard 1967b:1, where it originally appeared with tone marks as part of the
phrase sīˀī sī:k ‘Clover is green’.
83
   No other alternate form for mi other than mi: is ever observed.
72                            University of California Publications in Linguisticsreasons. For example, the CVCV verb root la:le- ‘crawl’ (MF) is likely actually lal-84. It is
not uncommon to find /e/~/i/ following verb roots as this is the epenthetic vowel85
common in Yuki for dividing consonant clusters. An example of this in use would be /i/
following the root wąk- ‘pay, lend’ in wąkiwič ‘lent’ (FL).
   With regard to CVCV noun roots, once again it seems that the clearest case for such
roots comes from borrowings which were presumably quite recent at the time of
documentation. These include words such as the Spanish borrowing mu:la ‘mule’ (MF).
There are some rare non-borrowed CVCV noun roots such as mąwe ‘marked bone used
in handgame’ (AA).
   Some CVCV verb roots from earlier documentation and analysis such as hana-
‘know’86 are later recorded by other linguists as having a final consonant; in this case
this is hanak- (AA). In these cases it seems likely that the final consonant in the verb
root was not heard or not recorded as part of the root by the linguist documenting the
original form.
   Examples of noun roots are shown in (40a) and examples of verb roots are shown in
(40b). Syllable boundaries are marked within disyllabic roots.(40a) CV                  ti: ‘tea’ MF (unclear if non-borrowed CV noun roots exist)

      CVCVC               č’i:.mit̯ ‘bird’ AA(40b) CV                  ha:- ‘run’ AA (unclear if this is ha- or actually hah-)

84
   Vowel length in la:le- would be due to word stress.

   For further discussion of Yuki epenthetic vowels see §3.4.
86
   hana- ‘know’ is taken from Sawyer & Schlichter 1984:120. As it is a form recorded by Kroeber, there is a
high degree of likelihood that it was recorded from Ralph Moore, Kroeber’s primary Yuki consultant.

1985:22a). The vowel inventories are slightly different for the three Northern Yukian
Languages, as shown in Figure 8. In her reconstruction of Proto-Northern Yukian,
Schlichter (1985:30) notes that Coast Yuki /e/ and Huchnom /ʌ/ correspond to Yuki
/ą/. She also notes (1985:39) that “e and a seem to have been tending toward a merger
in Coast Yuki, both often being realized as [æ].” Insufficient data are available to
describe the stress system of Huchnom or Coast Yuki.","[98, 99, 100, 101]"
"                             2.1.1.4.2. Post-Velar /k/ and /k’/The place of articulation of /k/ and /k’/ is post-velar. Yuki /k/ and /k’/ are pronounced
further back than English /k/, but not so far back as to be considered uvular. The post-
velar place of articulation for /k/ and /k’/ is not limited to the speech of Frank Logan,
as Kroeber (1911:348), who worked with Yuki speaker Ralph Moore, also makes this
observation stating that: “post-palatals…[are] apparently formed somewhat farther
back in the mouth than the ordinary English k sounds.”                                      2.1.1.4.3. /š/ and /č//š/, /č/, and /č’/ are classified as palato-alveolar consonants44. In Logan’s
pronunciation the place of articulation of these sounds is close to that of /ṭ/45.                                     2.1.1.4.4. /s’/ and /w’/Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:10) include /s’/ as a possible phoneme and /w’/ as a
phoneme in the inventory of Yuki consonant phonemes. Neither of these consonants is
present in any Yuki word with the glottalized or pre-glottalized pronunciation that one
44
   Langdon and Silver (1984:151) recognize Yuki as having a dental stop /t̯/, an alveolar or postalveolar
stop /ṭ/, and a postalveolar or retroflex fricative /ʂ/, but not a postalveolar or retroflex affricate /tʂ/.
45
   The postalveolar or retroflex quality in the pronunciation of /š/ was also noted by Kroeber, who would
transcribe some instances of /š/ as <ṣ>, as in: hą́:ʂimil ‘(Taykómol) told him to build’ (RM).
                                        Phonetics and Phonology                                     43would expect in a Yuki glottalized consonant. Instead Schlichter’s claim for the
existence of these two phonemes, though never explicitly stated, appears to be drawn
from a comparison with forms present in Huchnom and Coast Yuki and a deeper
historic and morphophonemic analysis of morpheme-final glottalized consonants.
   The existence of /s’/ and /w’/ in Yuki can be extrapolated from the process
described in §2.1.1.8.8.1. As a result of this process the glottalization of morpheme-final
glottalized stops and affricates is not pronounced on the stop or affricate, but instead
spreads to the preceding vowel where the it is pronounced as a VʔV sequence. The
examples discussed below are taken from Schlichter’s reconstruction of Proto-
Northern Yukian (PNY)46.
   The second person plural agent pronoun is recorded as moˀos (AA, MF) or mos (AA)47.
Schlichter (1985:21) reconstructs this pronoun as Proto-Northern Yukian (PNY) *miˀ ~
*moˀ ‘second person’48 affixed with PNY plural *-s. The result is a final [ˀs] sequence with
the glottalization following the pattern observed for morpheme-final glottalized
consonants. Instead of being pronounced as a glottalized consonant, the glottalization
spreads to the preceding vowel and is manifested as a VʔV sequence. Thus: PNY: *moˀ +
*-s = Yuki: *moˀs > moˀos.
   Similarly for naw ‘bee, yellowjacket,’ alternate forms recorded for this word in Yuki
and cognate forms recorded in Huchnom and Coast Yuki show the same VʔV sequence
seen in other types of morpheme-final glottalized consonants. This is seen in Huchnom
naˀa:w, naw ‘honeybee’ and Coast Yuki nά’ ‘αw ‘yellowjacket’ and earlier Yuki forms, such
as na’ǝ̨m ‘yellowjacket’ recorded from Minnie Fulwider by Sydney Lamb (Schlichter
1985:378).
   /w’/ never appears as [ˀw] or [w’] in a surface form of ‘bee, honeybee, yellowjacket’
in Yuki itself, though the pattern is suggestive of its existence underlyingly. /w’/ does46
   In her reconstruction, Schlichter refers to the reconstructed ancestor of Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast
Yuki as Proto-Yukian. In this work the proto-language of these three languages is referred to as Proto-
Northern Yukian to avoid confusion with the ancestor language shared by the three Northern Yukian
languages and Wappo.
47
   In Coast Yuki the pre-glottalization of final /s/ is preserved: mô’s̥ ‘ye’ (Schlichter 1985:381).
48
    Schlichter’s reconstruction of PNY second-person pronouns is supported by the fact that these
pronouns were probably borrowed from the Pomoan languages. Yuki miˀ ‘2SG.AGT’ and mos ~ moˀos
‘2PL.AGT’ correspond well to Eastern Pomo mí ‘2SG.OBL’ and má ‘2PL.NOM/ACC’ (Sawyer and Schlichter
1984:244, McLendon 1975:107). One can imagine speakers of Proto-Northern Yukian (PNY) suffixing the
Pomoan second person plural pronoun with PNY plural *-s in order to emphasize the plural nature of
that pronoun or to match an existing paradigm.
44                         University of California Publications in Linguisticsappear in surface forms in Huchnom hewˀ ‘yes’ and Coast Yuki héw’ ‘yes’, but not in Yuki
hąwhaˀ ‘yes’ (AA).
   A phonemic glottalized form /y’/ exists for the other Yuki glide /y/, thus the
existence of phonemic /w’/ in Yuki would not be unexpected. In addition, /w’/ also
exists in Wappo (Thompson et al. 2006:3), therefore there is a precedent for this
phoneme in Yukian. Phonemic /s’/ on the other hand is extremely rare typologically
and occurs only phonetically or allophonically in the non-Northern Yukian languages
spoken in the region surrounding Yuki.","[70, 71, 72]"

made on the basis of overt marking for core cases. Human nouns acting as grammatical
patients are marked for patient case, and oblique case endings are attached to the
dative form of human nouns. Non-human nouns acting as grammatical patients are not
marked for patient case, with oblique case endings attaching directly to the noun root
of non-human nouns. In certain instances non-human animates acting as grammatical
patients will be marked for patient case. This is seen for specific groups of animate
nouns that are either highly affected by the action of the verb or significant to a
particular portion of narrative. It is unclear which of these two possibilities is the
determining factor. In the texts, non-human animates are frequently marked for
patient case when addressed, which may suggest that the deciding factor in patient
case marking of non-humans is whether they are seen as specific individuals or not.
   Kinship nouns form a separate sub-class within human nouns. These nouns are not
treated differently in terms of argument marking, but they do have unique possessive
morphology. When they are possessed by a pronominal referent, a series of possessive
prefixes is used that are different from those used for other nouns. Sawyer and
Schlichter (1984) classify these prefixes as markers of inalienable possession. Kinship
nouns often appear with a possessor, but they can also appear without a possessor, just
like all other Yuki nouns.
   Number is distinguished for only a tiny handful of human nouns.
   Table 8 provides an overview of Yuki noun morphology.

could also be that in certain situations nouns affixed with instrumental -ok are also
affixed with patient case marking when these nouns are considered to be highly
affected by the action of the verb in that clause. There are too few examples to really
know for certain, but there is some qualitative difference between the level of
affectedness of yímok ‘by the fire’, in (113), where fire is not affected, but is instead
scorching others, and lílaˀok ‘with his stone’, in (114), where the stone, though being
hurled, is still being affected by the action. Perhaps the same is true for (115), but
without more examples of k’oˀol k’ani ‘Wailaki language’ in this kind of a use, it is not
possible to say for certain why patient case marking may occur in this example.","[164, 165]"

                                           Introduction                                        25                                       1 .6.2. MethodsThe descriptions of phonetics and phonology in Chapter 2 are based on earlier studies
of Yuki phonetics and phonology and on analysis of an hour-long recording of Yuki
speaker Frank Logan27. This recording was also used for the study of the acoustic
correlates of Yuki stress in §2.2.1.3. Values for f0 or pitch, intensity, and duration were
measured in the phonetic analysis software Praat. Statistical analysis was performed
using the statistical analysis software SPSS 15.0.
   For the remainder of this grammar, all analyses began with taking the texts of the
research corpus, described in §1.6.1, and retyping them in the Yuki practical
orthography, described in §1.6.5. Then the words in the texts were glossed and a
preliminary morphemic analysis was carried out. The glossing and division of words
into morphemes at this stage was based on Kroeber’s glosses of the texts in his original
notes and on earlier descriptions of Yuki and Yukian morphology, particularly those in
Kroeber 1911, Sawyer and Schlichter 1984, and Schlichter 1985. In his original notes
Kroeber provides word glosses for many, but not all, of the words in the texts. These
glosses were used as a starting point, but then were altered based on the sources given
here and my increasing facility with Yuki throughout the course of my work. The
morphemic analysis of all the words in the texts came as a result of my own work and
analysis of Yuki morphology.
   At this point each proposed morpheme was studied by analyzing its use throughout
the texts28 and in elicited data. If the morpheme showed a consistent function, a
description was written with examples from the texts and elicitation. If the morpheme
did not show such a function, then it was determined whether the proposed morpheme
was itself composed of smaller morphemes with consistent functions. If no such
analysis was possible, then it was noted in the description that a morpheme had no
clearly determinable function29.
   Free translations of examples from Origins and Coyote and the World are mostly taken
from Kroeber’s (1932:906-912,918-927) own published English-language version of these
texts. In comparing these English-language translations with the original Yuki texts, I
found that the 1932 free translations appeared to be sentence-by-sentence translations
of the original Yuki. In the rare case where I felt that the Yuki differed from Kroeber’s

   This recording was made by James Crawford in 1953.

   ‘Texts” refers to the texts collected by Kroeber and Uldall in the research corpus.

    For example, the function of the verb morphemes -ą and -lim, discussed in §7.5.9, could not be
determined.
26                       University of California Publications in Linguisticstranslation, I give an alternate free translation of my own in a footnote. The free
translations for Feather Dance Narrative are my own. Ents and Upek and Ioi are originally
Chinook myths appearing in Franz Boas’ 1894 Chinook Texts. The English-language
version of these texts appears to have been given by Kroeber to Ralph Moore for
translation into Yuki. The free translations given with examples in this grammar are
those provided by Kroeber (1902e) with these two stories in his original notes.
   For Chapter 3, examples were drawn from the corpus to identify the environment
governing particular morphophonemic alternations. For Chapter 15, examples of
particular types of clauses were drawn from the corpus and then described.","[52, 53, 54]"

      In his original description of Yuki, Kroeber (1911:367) writes this pronoun as ki-mos-i-at.

though kimoˀṣeyyat does not appear to mean ‘they themselves’ and may be the third
person distributive plural dative kimasąt.
   A similar-looking form kimoˀosiyą is found in a few instances in the texts. kimoˀosiyą
does appear to be a distributive plural counterpart to kip, though it occurs so
infrequently that it is difficult to make this claim with absolute certainty. Like kip and
kipą, kimoˀosiyą seems to only refer to previous agent arguments.
   In (51), kimo:séya ‘they to themselves’ appears to behave as a coreferential pronoun,
in that it refers to the subject of the previous clause k’ol ˀaṭát ‘the rest of the people’.","[217, 218]"
"                                  1.5.3. ViabilityThe Yuki language is no longer spoken. No language programs exist for teaching the
language within the Yuki community at this time. The last Yuki speaker, Arthur
Anderson, died in 1983 (SSDI 2010). Even at that time Yuki had long ceased functioning
as a language of daily interaction. Yuki speaker Minnie Fulwider began her work with
linguists in the 1950s, and would later claim that she had not used Yuki since 1930.
Arthur Anderson worked with linguists Jesse Sawyer and Shirley Silver between 1972
and 1976 and at that time claimed that he had not used Yuki since 1908. Alice
Schlichter, who studied Yuki in the 1970s and 1980s writes of Fulwider and Anderson:
“Neither informant…is a fluent speaker of Yuki; probably neither ever was … The
24                               University of California Publications in Linguisticsinformants had to remember, often with considerable and time-consuming effort,
words and phrases they had used or heard almost three quarters of a century ago.”

write this grammar, and background information about the consultants. The practical
orthography is also described and compared with practical orthographies used by
previous researchers of Yuki and the other Northern Yukian languages.","[51, 52]"
"   By the beginning of the twentieth century, when Kroeber began his work on Yuki, it
seems that dialect differences had largely been lost among Yuki speakers. He observes
that as a result of English-language schooling, Native American children from Round
Valley would often lose their parents’ language or if they continued to speak it,
differences between dialects were probably getting “blurred out” (Kroeber 1931-
1932/1958). Foster (1944:161) gives this account of the nature of Yuki dialect
say ‘I am a Middle Westerner,’ ‘I am a Southerner,’ or ‘I am a New Englander,’ and differences in speech
were probably about as marked. But instead of a national governmental organization for the whole area,
the Yuki had only consciousness of kind to bind them together.”

Valley in 1937:        Dialectic differences among Yuki subgroups included speed in speaking,
        different words for the same thing or act, and slightly divergent accents. The
        Ukomno’m and Witukomno’m were regarded as fast talkers, while the Ta’no’m
        and Huititno’m spoke more slowly. An example of phonetic difference follows:
        small, ónsil (Titomno’m), únsil (Ukomno’m). An example of word difference is:
        hot, pukhólt (Witukomno’m), šúmlil (Huititno’m and Ukomno’m). An example of
        different expressions is: to quiet a child, úlai (Witukomno’m), čiči (Ukomno’m),
        k’íha (Huititno’m), k’oš (Ta’no’m; Wailaki word). In calling a child there are the
        following: my child (either sex), ik’ili (Huititno’m); my son (lit., “my child my
        father”), ik’il-eŋk’un, and my daughter (lit., “my child my mother”), il’il-eŋk’an

referents or speech events. Yuki locative terms can be formed on the base of the
proximal demonstrative kaˀ, the distal demonstrative kiˀ, and other locative terms
including kipąw ‘back’, wil ‘far’, and wąk ‘after, later’. Locative terms are understood
here to mean any type of word indicating position or direction. This sets the locative
terms apart from noun case suffixes and enclitics, which are almost never found as
independent words and are almost always attached to a particular noun or verb. Yuki
does not have a clearly defined word class of adpositions.","[375, 376]"

place) he was standing’. As for (113), it is important to note that in (117) terminative274

"                                1.2.1. Previous Work on YukiYuki presents a bit of a paradox in terms of level of research versus amount of
published description available. Though Yuki was extensively documented over the
course of the twentieth century until the death of its last speaker in 1983 (SSDI 2010),
the actual amount of major published descriptive work on Yuki is relatively small.
   The first vocabulary of Yuki was collected by Lieutenant Edward Ross in the 1850s
(Golla 2011:190). The Ross vocabulary is combined with other Yuki lexical data collected
by Powers in Powers (1877). Curtin (1889) collected a Bureau of American Ethnology
(BAE) survey vocabulary.
   Alfred L. Kroeber12 is responsible for most of the existing documentation13 of Yuki.
Kroeber began documenting Yuki in December of 1901 and worked off and on with his
consultant, Ralph Moore, until the fall of 1902. In 1910, Kroeber briefly returned to
Round Valley assisting the United States census. The following year he published a
sketch of Yuki grammar (1911) and then began working again with Ralph Moore in
1912. During this period Kroeber used the kymograph to record phonetic tracings of
individual Yuki words spoken by Moore. In 1923 and 1927, Kroeber continued his work
with Moore, revisiting earlier notes and obtaining further phonetic tracings (Kroeber
1958b).
   In 1931, the Danish phonetician Hans Uldall came to Berkeley on a two-year
fellowship to work with speakers of Northern California languages. Kroeber and Uldall
collaborated on work with Yuki during this period (Kroeber 1958b). Uldall produced an
extensive though unpublished study of the pitch levels and contours in Yuki words.
Uldall (1932) concluded that Yuki is a tone language, though this was later argued not
to be the case by Schlichter (1978).
   In 1937, George Foster conducted ethnographic work with Ralph Moore and another
Yuki consultant, Eben Tillotson. In 1944 he published A Summary of Yuki Culture, based
on this research. Foster’s 1944 study is a fascinating description of Yuki and Huchnom
culture as he found it and as it was remembered by his consultants in the late 1930s. It12

or T. Kroeber (1970).

   See Appendix 5 for Kroeber’s fascinating, but unfinished description of the history of his work on Yuki.
10                               University of California Publications in Linguisticsalso contains some information about the Yuki and Huchnom languages, though not
much data in either language.
    Sydney Lamb worked with Yuki speakers Minnie Fulwider, Arthur Anderson, and
Frank Logan during the 1950s. James Crawford also worked with Frank Logan during
this period. In the 1960s, Roy Siniard also worked with Minnie Fulwider. Jesse Sawyer
and Shirley Silver worked with Yuki speaker Arthur Anderson in the 1970s. Later these
data were analyzed by Alice Schlichter14 for her MA thesis, which was published as Yuki
Vocabulary in 1984 credited to her and Jesse Sawyer (Elmendorf 1981:40-1, Sawyer and
Schlichter 1984:2).
    William Elmendorf also worked with Yuki speakers. Field notes collected by
Elmendorf, Lamb, and Kroeber are housed at the Survey of California and Other Indian
Languages (SCOIL) in the Linguistics Department of the University of California,
Berkeley. Curtin’s (1889) BAE survey vocabulary is also available on microfilm at SCOIL.
All of the Yuki materials from Kroeber’s work with Moore in the early twentieth
century are housed at the American Philosophical Society (APS).
    The three seminal works on the Yuki language are Kroeber’s 1911 original
grammatical sketch of Yuki published as a chapter of The Languages of the Coast of
California North of San Francisco, Sawyer and Schlichter’s 1984 Yuki Vocabulary, and
Schlichter’s 1985 unpublished Ph.D. dissertation The Yukian Languages. Kroeber’s 1911
description contains the only published description of Yuki grammar and the only
published text in Yuki. Sawyer and Schlichter’s 1984 dictionary is a comprehensive
index of Yuki vocabulary containing data from previous researchers, as well as from
Jesse Sawyer and Shirley Silver’s previous work with Yuki speakers Minnie Fulwider
and Arthur Anderson. Yuki Vocabulary also contains a sketch of Yuki phonology, which
lists Yuki phonemes and gives a brief description of vowel allophony in stressed and
unstressed syllables. Schlichter’s 1985 Ph.D. dissertation contains her reconstruction of
Proto-Yukian, as well as valuable information about the grammar and phonology of the
three contemporary Northern Yukian languages, Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast Yuki.
    Beyond this there are a number of articles and other unpublished studies available
on various aspects of Yuki. Mithun (2008) contains a discussion of the Yuki agent-
patient grammatical relations system. Mithun (2012) discusses morphological
borrowing in Yuki. As noted above, in an extensive but unpublished study, Uldall (1932)
claims that Yuki is a tone language, which is rebutted by Schlichter (1978). Elmendorf
(1981) discusses language change in languages near extinction using Yuki and Wappo as
case studies for his article. Early descriptions of Yuki and the Yuki people are found in14
     In more recent publications, Schlichter published as Alice Shepherd.

to Wappo is discussed in these works as well. Other more recent discussion in support
of this relationship is found in Elmendorf (1968, 1981, 1997) with Sawyer (1980)
providing the dissenting opinion claiming that similarities between Yuki and Wappo
are due to contact rather than shared origin. Possible effects of contact between Yuki
and the Athabaskan languages are discussed in Kroeber (1959). More distant proposed
genetic relationships are discussed in Sapir (1929), Elmendorf (1963, 1964), Swadesh
(1954), Shipley (1957), Greenberg (1987, 1996), Golla (1996a), Munro (1994), Kimball
(1992, 1997), Elmendorf and Shepherd (1999).","[37, 38, 39]"

allative =wit. The difference between the use of these two cases is sometimes unclear,
but in general it appears that =k’il can be used to express not just a general directional
locative meaning, but also a meaning of motion towards a point with the implication
that this is the endpoint of the motion. =k’il is also used in one instance to mean ‘to be
physically against an object’. The terminative is also occasionally seen suffixed to verbs.
   (92) and (93) are examples of terminative =k’il showing motion towards an object or
location. In (92), the direction in which the individuals are racing is hánk’il ‘toward the

Table 6: Yuki Body Prefixes (Schlichter 1978:16)   The origin of some of the body prefixes appears to be fairly transparent, in that they
are phonetically reduced forms of full nouns. The stress pattern matches that of many
compounds, therefore these prefixed words can likely be considered lexicalized
compounds that preserve the stress of the original compound.
   In prefixed words, the body prefixes are unstressed with primary stress remaining
on the root. This is shown in (32a) and (32b)67.(32a) ˀi:       ną.nák.uč
      ˀi:       nąnák-wič
      1SG.PAT remember-PST2
      ‘I remember it.’ FL65
   The information in Table 6 is adapted from Schlichter 1978. It appears here with examples and showing
further variation in the prefixes that appears in Frank Logan’s speech.
66
   In Logan’s speech it is not possible to discern na- ‘belonging to the head’ and ną- ‘belonging to the
mouth’, with both prefixes sounding like ną-. Therefore it seems that a distinction between these two
prefixes may not have existed for him.
67
   The syllable boundary between prefix and stressed root is marked and the body prefixes are underlined
but not glossed in the examples showing the prefixes in use. This is because the meaning of the root
following the prefix is not known. In terms of the stress pattern, there is an unstressed prefix followed by
a stressed verb root, but in terms of actual meaning, the prefix and the stressed root form the actual
meaningful verb root. Thus nąnák- means ‘remember’, but by itself nák- does not mean anything
anymore.

‘related to the senses’ and ną- ‘related to the head or mouth,’ attached to the root. This
is shown in (33).(33)       ˀi:          hą.ną.yáwuč
           ˀi:          hąnąyá-wič
           1SG.PAT      believe-PST2
           ‘I believed him.’ FL   Nouns prefixed with possessive prefixes will show the same pattern of stress as for
the body prefixes. The possessive prefix is unstressed with primary stress falling on the
initial syllable of the noun root. This is shown in (34).(34)       ˀiŋ-k’íč
           1SG.KIN.POSS-older.brother
           ‘(my) older brother’ FL   The stress pattern for reduplicated forms is the same as for prefixed forms. No
examples of reduplicated forms are found in the Logan recording. Schlichter (1978:16)
describes primary stress in reduplicated forms as occurring on the second syllable,
while the reduplicant is the unstressed initial syllable.
   Lexicalized compounds show a fairly consistent pattern of primary stress on the
initial syllable of the second element of the compound, with secondary stress falling on
the first element of the compound. The first element is typically monosyllabic, but in a
handful of examples in the corpus with a disyllabic first element, the secondary stress
falls on the initial syllable, as in (35d) and (35e) 68.(35a) ˀùk-hóṭ
      water-large
      ‘ocean’ FL
68
     Primary stress is marked with an acute accent and secondary stress is marked with a grave accent.

      ‘snake’ FL   This pattern does not hold as well for non-lexicalized compounds. In these cases,
vowel duration and pitch, the indicators of stress, are not consistently greater on the
initial syllable of either element in the compound. This may mean that in lexicalized
compounds, the non-final element of the compound is analyzed in terms of stress as a
prefix on the final element of the compound, while in non-lexicalized compounds each
word has the stress of an independent word, or at least a word not as connected to the
other elements in the compound as those in a lexicalized compound. Examples of non-
lexicalized compounds are shown in (36).","[86, 87, 88]"

    Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:12) note that in two circumstances personal pronouns act as clitics: “(1) If
a sentence consists of only a verb and a patient pronoun, the pronoun is postponed to the verb; for
example, šaˑteštekˀe ‘I’m getting cold’ < šaˑteštek + ˀiˑ. The pronoun is here intermediate between a word
and a suffix… Compare, however, čaˑna ˀi ‘Give it to me!’, where the pronoun follows the verb but remains
an independent word. (2) In the speech of Arthur Anderson, ˀąp ‘I’ sometimes becomes ˀup, its vowel
being assimilated to an u in the following verb, for example, kawaye ˀup munhek ‘I’m going to steal that
horse.’ In this case, the pronoun could be considered prefixed to the verb.”
