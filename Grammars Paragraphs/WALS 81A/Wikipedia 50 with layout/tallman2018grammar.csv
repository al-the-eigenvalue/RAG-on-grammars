"         It is against this background that I define the terms morphotactics and syntax asopposing ends of a continuum of bondedness rather than terms that identify different
10 An example of such an organizational principle comes from Quechua. In Quechua, in syntax the language
has an subject-object-verb order. Inside the verbal word, the order it verb-object-subject, where the object
and subject are expressed by suffixes. Thus, the order of the expression of grammatical relations is reversed
(Weber 1980).",[156]
"       That objects can occur in position 7 is illustrated below. Position 7 is a zone wherethe object and the subject can variably order. My impression is that the argument which ismost topical (most activated based on previous discourse context) is the one which is closerto the verb. Thus, PAV order is conditioned where A is mentioned in the previousdiscourse. This is illustrated with the text examples in (5.111). (5.111a) displays a APVorder. The proper noun adan is the A argument, and the P argument is wɨtí ‘fish hook’. Thefollowing sentence displays and (5.111b) displays a PAV order.",[370]
"When the V̄-constituent occurs in position 3, the {A,S} subject is fixed in position 7 afterthe V̄-constituent. The {A,S} subject does not occur in a fixed order with respect to the V̄-constituent. On the other hand, the {P,T,R} object precedes the V̄-constituent across theseconstructions where the V̄-constituent occurs in position 8 and position 3.",[387]
"       The default order for non-verbal predicate constructions marked with ʂo‘declarative’, kiá seems to be predicate-SNV with SNV-predicate order as a possibility. Non-verbal predicate constructions marked with ki ‘declarative, future’ display an obligatorypredicate-SNV order. SNV-predicate order is ungrammatical with non-verbal predicateconstructions marked with ki ‘declarative, future’. Interrogative non-verbal predicateconstructions marked with ní display default SNV-predicate order; predicate-SNV orderseems to be the marked option with interrogative non-verbal predicate constructions.       while subject-predicate order seems to encode that the SNV is in focus. The precisetype of focus for the subject-predicate ordering requires future research (see Valle [2017]for a discussion of the different types of focus in Kakataibo). Examples of subject-predicateorder with the declarative marker are provided below.",[235]
"       Constituent-flexible (C-flexible) clause-type/rank morphemes allow subjects(S/A) to occur in more than one syntactic position (not simultaneously); positions 2, 7 and16. Alternatively, constituent-rigid (C-rigid) clause-type/rank morphemes force thesubject to only occur in one posisition; position 16. Effectively, the C-rigid morphemesforce a OVA/VS word order, while the former allow free constituent ordering. All C-

"       7.1.1 Intransitive vs. Monotransitive: A, S and P           7.1.1.1. Fronted-VP constructions: {A,S} vs. {P}Recall from Section 5.2.3.5 that the subject can occur in positions 2,7 and 16 of thesentence. In positions 2 or 7, the alignment based on constituent order is neutral {A,S,P}since A and P can be variably ordered. However, in the fronted-VP construction, only theA and S arguments can occur in position 7, and P appears in a fronted position before theV̄-constituent (see Section 5.2.3.15.1 for discussion).",[566]
"             5.2.3.14. Verb stratum 3 – Position 18The last position in the sentence can be occupied by a number of different types ofcategories that encode adverbial semantics, such as adverbials, nominalized/relativizedclauses, same subject clauses, different subject clauses and postpositional phrases. Thesemodifiers can occur in any order at the end of the sentence. When subordinate (non-main)clauses occur in this position they combine with the epenthetic clitic =na. Put another way,=na signals that some subordinate clause is a dependent to a clause to its left. The iterativecombination of deranked clauses in position 18 of the sentence is illustrated in () (5.130)below.",[384]

Chácobo can coordinate parts of the verb complex through same subjectconstructions. A same subject construction is a syndetic coordination construction wherethe conjunct is a same subject marker that also encodes the transitivity of the right-mostclause (see Haspelmath [2004] for a typological overview). The coordinated constituentsin such constructions corresponds exactly to the verb stem.","[321, 322]"

This section isconcerned with alignment based on constituent order. Neutral ditransitive verbs display aneutral alignment with respect to constituent order; P, T and R all display the samedistributional properties.",[581]

"       The Chácobo language contains a complex system of “graded tense” expressedthrough morphemes that encode various degrees of temporal distance from a reference time(up to 9 distinctions). Their behavior in discourse suggests that they straddle the boundarybetween tense and aspect categories. Chácobo encodes aspectual categories through avariety of constructions and morphemes, but most striking from a typological perspectivethrough word order. Result perfect readings are achieved through positioning the subjectafter a clause-type/rank morpheme; a morpheme which is obligatory in verbal predicateconstructions.",[75]

"       There are three construction types that display an accusative alignment inconstituent order; (i)   fronted-VP constructions (Section 5.2.3.6); (ii) auxiliary verbconstructions (Section 4.1.4); (iii) reportative C-flexible constructions (see 5.2.3.4 on the

I discuss these alignments by comparing intransitive and monotransitiveclauses in Section 7.1.1. With respect to alignments based on comparing monotransitiveand ditransitive constructions, P, T and R display neutral alignment with respect toconstituent order. The one exception to this is for constructions where R is marked withthe dative clitic =ki (indirect/direct ditransitive verbs). In such cases R patternsdistributionally with A in certain constructions. The constituent order alignment ofditransitive constructions is discussed in Section 7.1.2.","[565, 566]"

In the descriptive framework of thisthesis, therefore, whether syntactic relations extend into the “word” is a matter of degreethat could in principle vary between languages because syntactic relations and bondedness(wordhood) vary along continuous parameters in a language specific fashion.","[169, 170]"

          b.      Non-verbal predicate constructions divide into two types. A zero-marked                  non-verbal predicate construction and an overtly marked non-verbal                  predicate construction.          c.      Zero-marked constructions consist of simple juxtaposition of S and the                  predicate in a fixed predicate-S order. Zero-marked constructions can occur                  in subordinate clauses.          d.      Overtly-marked constructions contain the clause-type morphemes ʂo                  ‘declarative’ or ní ‘interrogative’ which occur after the noun phrase or the                  predicate construct. Those overtly-marked constructions that contain ʂo                  ‘declarative’, ní ‘interrogative’, and kiá ‘reportative’ allow SNV and the                  predicate to variably order (predicate-S order appears to be the default). A                  non-verbal predicate construction marked with ki ‘declarative, posterior’                  only allows for the predicate-SNV order.          e.      The clause-type/rank morphemes of verbal predicate constructions (e.g. =kɨ                  ‘declarative, past’; =wɨ́ ‘imperative’) cannot occur in non-verbal predicate                  constructions.1212 For some clause-type/rank morphemes an analysis might be available that understands them as occuring
in either the verbal predicate construction or in the non-verbal predicate construction. For instance, the formkiá which encodes reportative occurs in the non-verbal predicate construction as a clause-type/rankmorpheme and the verbal predicate construction as a morpheme encoding modal semantics. The form kiwhich encodes declarative semantics encodes future or posterior in non-verbal predicate constructions and                                                     189
        The “non-verbal” portion of non-verbal predicate constructions should beinterpreted positively as stating that non-verbal constructs can function as the predicaterather than negatively as stating that verb roots cannot function as predicates in suchconstructions. The reason for this is that there is a class of intransitive verb roots (non-agentive verbs) that can function as predicates in non-verbal predicate constructions,discussed in Section 4.1.2.2. Furthermore, nominalized verbal predicate constructions canalso function as the predicate in non-verbal predicate constructions, discussed in Section4.1.2.3.","[231, 232, 233]"
