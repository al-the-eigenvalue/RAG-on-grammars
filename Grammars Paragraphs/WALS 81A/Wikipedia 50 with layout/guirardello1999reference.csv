"       As we can see, in Trumai we do not have reasons to group {S,A} together as thecategory of Subject, and to say that the Subject of this language is actually the grouping{S,O} is not a good solution either. The same can be said with regard to the category ofObject: there are no reasons to group O and the DAT argument of Extended Intransitiveverbs together, given their differences in case-marking (O is marked by -9, DAT by -#l, -ki, -s), word order (O is preverbal, DAT follows the VP), and syntactic behavior (O alignswith S rather than with DAT).
                                                                                             296
        Again, we have the question: why do we need the traditional grammaticalrelationships of Subject, Object, etc., to talk about Trumai? We do not. For the purpose ofdescribing the grammar of this language, such relations are not necessary. They would beinteresting for the purpose of doing typological studies, that is, if we want to compareTrumai to other languages of the world. However, there is not much to say about thecategory of Subject in Trumai. If we consider Givon’s idea that a language with fewsubject properties has only a slightly grammaticalized subject, then we can say that thegrouping {S,A} could be considered the Subject of Trumai, but it would be a Subject inthe very first steps to grammaticalization. It may be showing its first manifestations in thecontrol of anaphoric elements, as examples (79-81) above suggest, but there are stilltremendous limitations. Perhaps in future research, careful analysis of texts can bring tolight facts that help us to better define a category of Subject for Trumai.","[323, 324]"
"           And if we say that O is the Subject (i.e. the primary topic) of a clause, what is thenthe A argument? The Object (i.e. the secondary topic)? In this case, we would have alanguage in which O is always codified as being more topical than A, even though A          isagent, a very salient participant of the event, and a strong candidate to be the primarytopic of any Transitive clause. As we see, it is problematic to say that O is the Subject ofa clause. Even if we say that A is not the Object, but rather an ‘Oblique’, there will becomplications (cf. item (iii)). Another problem is that the suppression of the S argumentin a clause produces semantic effects that are different from the suppression of the Oargument (cf. chapter 9, section 9.1.1). This being so, how much sense does it make to
                                                                                             294group S and O together as the ‘Subject’ of this language? To us, it seems that to group Sand O as the Subject category of Trumai is to let the formal criteria override semantic andpragmatic factors that are also important.
(ii) to say that the grouping {S,O} is the Subject in Trumai forces the language to satisfythe necessity of having grammatical relations. Is really necessary to talk about Subject orObject in order to describe the Trumai grammar? No. We can describe the system and thesyntax of the language only on the basis of the argument types (Absolutive, Ergative,Dative) that are found in a clause. The use of the labels introduced in section 7.1.1. is alsoenough to describe the Trumai grammar;(iii) one could suggest that in a clause with A and O arguments, the O argument (the NP-patient, marked by -¢) is the Subject, and the A argument (the NP-agent, marked by -k) isactually an ‘Oblique’. Thus, a clause with a verb such as mapa ‘break’ would have thefollowing configuration:        Agent        Patient                           Agent       Patient
        NP-k         NP-¢       Vv            >        ‘Oblique’   Subject    Vin other words, the clause would have a passive voice configuration, with the patientmarked as Subject (the primary clausal topic) and the agent marked as ‘Oblique’ (aperipheral function). An important detail here is that this “passive” clause has no activecounterpart, in which the NP-agent would be codified as Subject (primary topic) and theNP-patient would be codified as Object (secondary topic). There is obviously a problem
                                                                                              295with this analysis. It is strange that a language would have “passive” clauses withouthaving active ones, considering that the passive voice is cross-linguistically morerestricted in discourse (this kind of voice is generally used for special purposes, such asdemoting the agent and promoting the patient to primary topic). Therefore, to say that {O,S} (the Absolutive) is the Subject category of Trumai does not help us to understand thesystem of the language; on the contrary, it leads us to characterize it in a strange way;(iv) one could say that the grouping {S,O} would be the Subject category in Trumaibecause, according to the coding properties presented above, every sentence has aSubject, and in Trumai the Absolutive is always present in a clause. However, this is notexactly true. The Absolutive argument in Trumai occurs in all clause types, that is, thecanonical Intransitive and Transitive clauses. However, not every individual clausenecessarily has an Absolutive mark. Sometimes the Absolutive argument is suppressedbecause of pragmatic reasons (cf. chapter 9 on voice).","[321, 322, 323]"
"There are four verbs types in the language: Intransitive, Extended Intransitive, Transitive,and Extended Transitive. There are also auxiliaries, which can be subdivided in two sets:Aspect-Mood and Spatial-orientation (with the further subdivision of Body Posture andDirectional auxiliaries).
        Trumai has rich syntax, although word order can change because of pragmaticfactors. The case-system shows an Ergative-Absolutive alignment. With regard togrammatical relations, the traditional relations of ‘Subject’, ‘Object’, and ‘IndirectObject’ do not play a central role in Trumai grammar. The case-marking system and thesyntax of the language consistently identify three argument types: Absolutive, Ergative,and Dative; each type contains a subset of the traditional relations.","[5, 6]"
"         As mentioned in chapter 5, simple declarative clauses can have verbal or non-verbal predicates. For clauses with verbal predicates, the basic or unmarked word orders
                                                                                             229
are [S V (DAT)] and [A O V (DAT)]. Variations in the order are possible when a specificpiece of information needs to be highlighted. The piece of information — which is aconstituent - comes in the first position of the clause, and can be followed by theFocus/Tense particle ka_in or chi_in (actually, the fronting of the constituent seems to bethe important step for the highlighting). If the constituent being highlighted is a NP, extraverbal morphology may be necessary, depending on its grammatical role (i.e. if it is anAbsolutive NP).","[256, 257]"
"
        For clauses with non-verbal predicates (i.e. nominal, equative, locative,existential), there are two possible word orders, [Pred Subj (Cop)] and [Subj (Cop) Pred],depending on pragmatic factors, that is, which piece of information needs to behighlighted. A Focus/Tense particle in general is used after the element under focus,although it is not always employed (again, the fronting of the information seems to be theimportant factor). The presence of the Copula chi‘ is often attested for nominal andequative predicates, but is not always required, especially with 3rd. person subjects (fornominal predicates, when the order is Subj Pred, the copula is present). Locative andExistential predicates almost do not employ the Copula chi. Only the order [Pred Subj] ispossible for existential predicates.",[257]
"         The codification of the primary clausal topic - the Subject - is done throughseveral devices, such as word order, verb agreement, nominal case-morphology, etc.",[315]
"         Among the coding devices proposed by Keenan (1976), we have:e   word order
e   verb agreement (i.e. the Subject controls person-marking on the verb)
e   nominal case-morphology (in general, the Subject receives the unmarked case)
e   behavior-and-control properties (such as control of coreference; reflexivization;
    control of coreference in relativization, etc.)e   indispensability (the Subject is the NP necessarily present in a clause. All clauses
    have a Subject)
e   agentivity (the agent often is the topical participant)
e   addressee phrase of the Imperative construction         The coding properties presented above work very well for identifying the Subjectof languages whose case system is Nominative-Accusative. For these languages, theproperties coincide in a way that results in a coherent notion of Subject: S and A, whichare “‘...the NPs which refer to functions that can be the initiating/controlling agents”
                                                                                                           288(Dixon 1994:124-125), aligned both in morphology and in syntax. Therefore, for theselanguages, Subject would be the grouping {S, A}.","[315, 316]"
"
7.3.1. Traditional eramatical relationships (‘Subject’, ‘Object’. etc)       We begin our discussion about grammatical relationships in Trumai with acitation from Dixon (1994:11): “Turning our attention now to syntax, we can first of allnote the confusion concerning the identity of the ‘subject’ in ergative languages”. That isindeed a complicated issue. In the linguistic literature, several authors have discussed thenotion of Subject, such as Keenan (1976), Comrie (1989), Li (1976), Dixon (1994), andGivon (1984, 1997), among others. There is some controversy about how to defineSubject, especially with regard to the Subject of Ergative languages; we will see why.
                                                                                           287         According to Givén (1984:138), Subject would be the grammaticalizeddiscursive-pragmatic role of topic; that is, Subject would be the codification of theprimary clausal topic, while Object would be the codification of the secondary clausaltopic.","[314, 315]"
"         The marking of the causee in morphological causatives is an important issuefor Comrie, especially when a Transitive verb is causativized. Given that inmorphological causatives there is only one verb, and that the introduction of the causerbrings one more participant to the event, the valency of the verb has to rearranged(theoretically, analytical causatives would not have this problem, because there are twoverbs in the construction, and each verb would have its own set of arguments).*         According to Comrie (1989:175), “cross-linguistically, this problem of valencyincrease is almost invariably solved by altering the expression of the causee”. In manylanguages, when a Transitive verb is causativized, the causer is marked as subject and thecausee (the original subject) is marked indirect object (Dative) or Instrumental; in somelanguages, the causee can be marked as object (Accusative). What would not beobservable in languages of the world is the marking of the causee as subject, because thenthe causativized verb would have two subjects.",[337]
"        In any case, the Trumai causative construction with Transitive verbs isproblematic for Comrie’s approach:1.   if we say that the Ergative marking marks Transitive subjects in Trumai, then the     causative construction of this language clearly violates his hierarchy;2.   if we say that the Ergative marking does not mark Transitive subjects, we still cannot     explain the doubling on A: if the marking of the causee is formally motivated, why is     the causee in the causative of Transitive verbs marked as Ergative? Why not as     Dative, since doubling on Dative is observed in other parts of the language (cf.     example (78) in chapter 7), while doubling on Ergative with the same verb is not?3.   actually, as discussed in chapter 7, we cannot talk about the traditional grammatical     relations of ‘Subject’ or ‘Object’ for Trumai, given that there are no syntactic     behaviors to support establishing these categories. Therefore, the marking of the
                                                                                             312     causee in the causative constructions in Trumai cannot be accounted for with     Comrie’s hierarchy, since the traditional grammatical relations do not play a role in     the grammar of this language.","[339, 340]"
"       Givén also points out that the Subjects of the languages of the world can presentdifferent degrees of grammaticalization: “...languages with fewer subject properties havea less prototypical - less grammaticalized - subject.” (Givon, 1997:29). In other words, aSubject that is very grammaticalized exhibits properties in all levels: case marking, wordorder, syntactic behavior, etc.. When the Subject of a language is little grammaticalized, itexhibits few properties, most likely in the syntactic behavior-and-control (which is moredirectly influenced by pragmatic factors) and less likely in the morphology.",[317]
"Attributive predicates that indicate permanent characteristics are probably simple nominalpredicates, with the adjective nominalized by ke behaving in the same way as nouns. The
                                                                                             205question is to understand the nature of the attributive predicates that indicate temporarystates. Let us first realign them strictly on the basis of word order:affirmative:                Adj     Subj (Cop)                  Subj Adj
negative:                   Adj tak Subj (Cop)                  Subj Adj anuk        Looking at the negative modality, we observe that when the order is nominal, thenegator is verbal, and conversely, when the order is verbal, the negator is nominal. Inother words, the negator has always opposite “polarity” in relation to the word order.","[230, 231]"
"        If the clause has nominal-predicate configuration, and the clause is not in thenegative modality, the predicate can indicate a temporary state if the predicate containsonly an adjective, or a permanent attribute if the adjective is modified by ke, probably therelativizer morpheme. If the clause is in the negative modality, it indicates permanentattributes (ke can also appear, but its use is optional in this case).
                                                                                                             203         If the clause has a verbal-predicate configuration, the predicate always indicatestemporary states, in both negative and affirmative modalities. However, in the negativemodality, the use of the verbal negator tak is allowed only with the word order [Adj takSubj Cop]. As already explained in the previous section, verbal predicates can alsopresent this word order when in the negative modality, but this construction is not thetypical one, since it is a “blend” of nominal and verbal predicates (it has the Copula andnominal word order, but the verbal negator). However, that is the only order allowed withattributive predicates if the negator is tak.                                              permanent                                 temporary

The historical approach offered here is based on internalreconstruction (taking into consideration some patterns observed in the language) and onparallel developments observed in other languages of the world, which makes thehistorical development presented here more plausible, because such developments arealready attested. The historical approach that is being proposed is not a tool to analyze thesynchronic data, it is just a way of understanding where the patterns came from.","[209, 210]"
"         As a final remark, we would like to point out that the construction observed inexamples (100-101) - that is, lexical zero in the subject position and no presence of 3Absenclitic - can be found in the affirmative modality for the expression of naturalphenomena:(114)    tsi-xu’tsa    ka_in       iyi.

Predicates for expressing Possession         The predicative possession constructions (i.e. ‘I have an X”) present the alienable-inalienable distinction already observed in the attributive possession construction (i.e.‘my X”). The possession of material objects requires a construction that is different fromthe one used for kinship terms and body parts. The alienable construction represents a

Theinalienable possession construction could have been treated as a part of the section onverbal predicates, but we preferred to analyze it here in order to give to the reader a wholepicture of predicative possession in Trumai.","[241, 242]"
"        Considering Comrie’s ideas, the causative construction in Trumai would representa complicated case. If we consider the characteristics of the morpheme ka, we cannot callthe Trumai causative construction analytical, since ka is not a verb (it does not presentverbal properties). Thus, we would have to say that the Trumai causative construction ismorphological rather than analytical. However, if we say this, there will be problems. Asshown above, in the causativization of Transitive verbs, the NP-causee is marked asErgative, as well as the NP-causer. If the causative construction in Trumai involves onlyone verb, then we have doubling on “subjects” in the construction; > that is, we have two

"       We also have in this section a discussion with regard to scope, based on the ideasof Givon (1984). As he explains, sometimes the scope of negation can be narrowed down,with only one constituent being negated (the verb, a NP, etc.). By narrowing the scope, aspeaker can make the grounds of denial more precise. When scope is not narrowed, wehave a neutral negation, that is, the event as a whole is denied. According to Givon,different strategies can be used for the negation of a single constituent. Some languagesfront the constituent to be negated; other languages move the constituent to the clausefinal position. Trumai has both strategies, but fronting is more common.

6.3.1.1. Negating the verb         As already mentioned in chapters 3 and 5, to negate verbal predicates, theNegation particle tak follows the verb, or the verb plus other elements, such asauxiliaries. Negative clauses can present different word orders, depending on whether theclause is a simple statement or an answer to a question. When it is the second case (i.e.answer), the clause has a nominal-predicate configuration (cf. chapter 5, section 5.2.3 onthis issue).

"That is, perhaps the loss of /h/ word-initially that is currently taking place is a7 In this example, not only /h/ is lost, but also the vowel of the adverb de ‘already’, probably in order to
avoid VV sequence after the loss of /h/ (i.e. dea > da).

                               Nouns and Noun Phrases
        One of the main characteristics of Trumai is that it is basically an isolatinglanguage. There are not many inflectional morphemes and in general words consist of asingle morpheme. The Trumai word classes are: nouns (including pronouns anddemonstratives), verbs, adjectives, adverbs, auxiliaries, postpositions, interrogativewords, words of quantification (numerals and quantifiers), pluralizers (dual and plural),particles (such as negation, causation, imperative particles, etc.), subordinators andinterjections. Nouns and verbs are the two main open classes and the distinction betweenthem is clear. The case of adjectives is a little more complicated, because they share someof the characteristics of both nouns and verbs, but at the same time they presentcharacteristics that are unique to them; section 2.2.4. of this chapter will explore thecharacteristics of adjectives. As we will see later, pronouns and demonstratives can beanalyzed as a subclass of nouns, given the similarities in their behaviors.","[40, 41, 42]"
"         Finally, there is one alternative way for the expression of the negative Imperativewith verbs. Actually, this alternative way is not really an imperative construction, butrather a simple clause, with the [Verb + Negator] in first position, followed by the adverbnuk ‘then’.® This alternative way of expressing negative commands is possible both withIntransitive and Transitive verbs. As example, we have:(86)     ofa      tak nuk hi chi kasoro-s
         hit/kill Neg then 2 Cop dog-Dat
         “You do not beat the dogs!’(87)     mapa tak nuk atlat chi.
         break Neg then pan Cop
         ‘(You) do not break the pan.’
7 However, as already mentioned in chapter 3, this point needs to be rechecked with other Trumai
consultants.
8 Despite the similarity in the phonological form, the adverb and the negator anuk are not the same
morpheme. Their syntactic behaviors are different.
                                                                                                         253         It is interesting to observe that the Imperative constructions with verbs can alsoemploy the adverb nuk, as well as the adverb hen, translated as ‘then’ too (the semanticdifferences between hen and nuk are explained in chapter 3, footnote 12). The adverb henis usually used in the affirmative modality (88-89), while nuk is more often used in thenegative (examples (90-91). However, this is just a tendency, not a rule, since nuk canalso be found in affirmative imperative constructions (92).(88)     wanama        hen
         Imp eat       then                                                ‘Then, eat!”°(89)      waki kuhmu hen                                                   ‘Then, throw it!”
         Imp throw then(90)     sone    tak     nuk    wanach.                                    ‘Then, do not drink!”
         drink Neg then        Imper(91)     kiti tak nuk waki.                                                ‘Then, do not give (it)!
         give Neg then Imper(92)     wana fa’tsa nuk ik       ha ami-ki      hi-tl.
         Imp listen then first 1 speak-Dat 2-Dat
         ‘Then, first listen to what I say to you!’
9 Tn this context, the adverb ken ‘then’ seems to have a exasperation sense (“Then, eat!’) rather than
temporal sense (‘Eat then!’, as opposed to ‘Eat now!’).
                                                                                              254                                       CHAPTER 7
                               Case-Marking Alignment
                             and Grammatical Relations        In this chapter, the case system of Trumai is described. The alignments observedin the data show that this language has an Ergative-Absolutive system, and that there arefour verb classes in Trumai. This language has three kinds of obligatory arguments(Ergative, Absolutive, Dative) and these argument types are very important in describingthe system of the language. The traditional grammatical relations (Subject, Object,Indirect Object) do not play a central role in Trumai grammar. There are no syntacticbehaviors that support establishing a cross-cutting category of either ‘Subject’ (groupingA and S) or ‘Object’ (grouping O and DAT). It seems that this language works on thebasis of another principle: ‘Core’ versus ‘Peripheral’ arguments, with different degrees ofcore/peripheriality.","[280, 281, 282]"
"       We observe that there is correlation of word order between [SV] - [OV] and thepossessive construction:                           NP possessor   NPpossessed   «>   SV   / OV
       This correlation is not mere coincidence. SV and OV probably came fromnominalizations of verbs used in cleft constructions that eventually became main clauses.",[210]
"         The third argument, DAT, is marked by -(V)tl, -ki, or -(V)s, depending on thecharacteristics of the head of the NP (cf. section 7.2.3.1). DAT can be absent when it isrecoverable by context; the verb does not receive any special mark. Examples:

       O occurs preverbally, otherwise ke appears after the verb. A comes before the VP,but it can change order without special morphology after the verb. DAT comes after theVP; it can also change positions without the appearance of extra morphology. Examples:(12)   O                    Foc/Tens    A                    Vike                 DAT

The Ergative-Absolutive pattern is manifested through case-marking, verb-marking, and word order, as summarized below:a. Case-markingon the arguments:
INTRANSITIVE                                  S-$     V

       There is one more clause type observed in Trumai. This type is required for verbssuch as fa ‘hit/kill’, sone ‘drink, chuda ‘make’, etc. It presents two arguments, one agent-like, another patient-like. The agent-like argument aligns with S in terms of case-markingand word order/constituency behavior. The patient-like argument aligns with the DAT
                                                                                                              261argument of Ditransitive verbs. We call this clause type Extended Intransitive, a termused by Dixon (1994).","[286, 287, 288, 289]"
"The inclusion of S in the verb phrase and the exclusion of DAT are surprising, but there isevidence for both. The evidence comes from the interaction of word order andmorphology, in which:
                                                                                             87(i) a pronominal clitic (the 3rd Abs enclitic -n/-e) is in complementary distribution withthe absolutive head noun;(ii) a special morpheme, ke, occurs whenever the absolutive NP is not immediatelypreverbal;(iii) the two second position Focus/Tense particles, ka in and chi in, give special status tothe combinations [SV] and [OV];(iv) it is not possible to insert adverbs between S and V, or O and V, without triggeringextra morphology.","[112, 113]"
"         These particles precede the verb, and when a DAT argument is also included inthe imperative construction, it has to either precede the particle or follow the verb, but it
7 It is interesting to observe that attributive predicates also allow the presence of the relativizer ke after the
Focus/Tense particle ka_in (cf. chapter 2). However, the attributive predicate has the word order
{ Pred ka_in ke Subj Cop], while here the word order is [Causer ka_in ke Causee O V Particle]. In other
words, there is a parallelism with regard the placement of ke, but that is the only similarity between
attributive predicates and the causative construction with constrative focus on the causer.

4.1. Definition of the notion “Auxiliary” and the linguistic literature        As Heine (1993:4-5) points out, the term ‘auxiliary’ is not very well defined in thelinguistic literature: “in many languages, experts will disagree with one another indefining the term auxiliary, or in determining the range of entities that should besubsumed under this label, or in deciding whether there is a need for such a label in thefirst place”. The relationship between auxiliaries and verbs is also a subject of intensediscussion: some authors treat them as different categories; others refer to auxiliaries assubsets of verbs; there are authors that mention that some auxiliaries can have “main verbuses” too. Heine also observes that auxiliaries have an “amphibian nature”, being neitherclearly lexical nor clearly grammatical entities.
                                                                                             129        For Heine, the use of the term ‘auxiliary’ is “...primarily associated with a limitedrange of notional domains, most of all with the domain of tense, aspect, and modality”,although he says that auxiliaries are not restricted only to these domains. Heine analyzesauxiliaries using a diachronic/grammaticalization perspective, and he describes theschematic concepts employed in the evolution of auxiliaries from verbs (the form inevolution from one kind of meaning, more concrete, to another one, more abstract). Withthis approach, the behaviors exhibited by auxiliaries and their relationship with verbsbecome more clear. The basic idea is that “..an auxiliary is no longer a full verb but notyet a grammatical inflection either...” (Heine: 86). That is, auxiliaries are a kind ofintermediate form, which gives account in some degree for their behaviors.","[154, 155]"
"        The relationship among the obligatory arguments types of Trumai may be betterunderstood if we do not talk about them in terms of Subject, Object, Indirect Object, butrather if we talk in terms of ‘Core’ versus ‘Peripheral’ arguments. In the next section, wepresent an alternative way of analyzing this relationship.",[324]

        Extended Intransitive verbs are neither Transitive nor merely Intransitive. Theyare not simple Intransitive verbs because they have an obligatory second argument;however, they cannot be called Transitive, because their morphosyntax is different fromthat observed with Transitive verbs and because their second argument is clearly markedas Dative.","[290, 291]"
"         As already said, the Temporal subordinate clause comes at the first position of thesentence. Sometimes the order can be changed, if the event in the main clause happened!2 With regard to the kinds of unreality conditional that Thompson and Longacre mention (“imaginative
unreal’, which refers to a situation that might happen or might have happened; ‘predictive unreal’, which
refers to a situation that we predict will happen), we need more research. Our hypothesis is that the
difference between the imaginative unreal and the predictive real may be expressed through the use of the
adverb men ‘frustratively’; that is, we imagine that the imaginative unreal conditional will have this adverb,
because often it is the case that the clauses in which men occurs refer to unreal or counterfactual situations
(cf. examples in chapter 3, section 3.4).
° Notice that the marker used in this example is -is, not -s, which is not accepted here (the subordinate
clause presents a non verbal word order):
(i)       *pech pata tak afiawn yi-s, ayey de hat’ke chikida tak.

before the one in the subordinate clause. In this case, the subordinate clause comes at theend of the sentence (the order is iconic: the event that happened first comes first):(80)     hai-ts kaksu      tsinuk de               yudut    kiti   ine-tl [hi wa-pata-s].

"        What about if we try to change the case marking of the NP-causee to Dative orInstrumental? In this case, the semantics of the clause is changed, too: (i) the causation isless direct; (ii) it cannot be accidental. In the case of the Dative marking, the consultant

It is important to say here that sentences (b) and (c) above have never been encountered intext nor have speakers offered such sentences spontaneously. There were presented inelicitation, and then interpreted by the consultants, but they are not really used by thespeakers. Example (b) is not the construction generally employed to show less autonomyof the causee in the event. Rather, the speakers use another construction, a special kind ofcleft/focus construction observed with causativized verbs, illustrated in (8b); perhaps theemphasis on the causer creates the idea that the causer forced the causee to do the action:Yaka extinguished the fire, but it was me who made her to do it = I forced her to do it:(8)     a. hai-ts    chi_in   Yaka-k           so-@          (o)pi             ka.

        On the other hand, in order to express more autonomy of the causee (in the sensethat the causer is giving permission to the causee to carry out an activity; thus, the causeehas some choice), the speakers use mit’ ‘leave’ in conjunction with the causativeconstruction. Mit’ is a verb, but in the causative construction, it behaves rather as anadverb, as the ordering shows in (12):(9)     wana mit’        hen                                             [mit’

        Besides the causative particle ka, the Transitive verb tao ‘order/give order’ canalso be used to express the idea of causing somebody to do something. The semanticdifference between the use of tao and use of the Causative particle ka is that with tao, it isexplicit how the causer made the causee execute the action (i.e. through an order). TheCausative particle is neutral with regard to means of causation; its semantics is moreabstract.

"         To account for the marking of the causee observed in the languages of the world,Comrie proposes a hierarchy of grammatical relations: Subject > Direct Object > IndirectObject > Other Oblique. His idea is that after all the other participants have been assignedcases from the beginning of the hierarchy, the causee would receive the next case down
4 “The morphological causative normally has a valency one higher than that of the corresponding non-
causative, since in addition to the arguments of that non-causative predicate there is also the causer. With
analytic causatives this introduces no problems, since each of the two predicates, expressing cause and
effect, retains it own set of arguments” (Comrie, 1989:175).

"        Von den Steinen (1884) was the first researcher to present information about theTrumai people and their language; he provides a list of basic vocabulary in Trumai (1.e.kinship terms, names of animals, objects, body parts). Quain and Murphy (1955) didanthropological studies on the Trumai people, but not on the language. The firstdescriptive studies on the Trumai language were made by Monod-Becquelin (1970, 1975,1976, 1977). Her work was focused on the description of the phonology and some aspectsof the morphology of the language. Monod-Becquelin’s work was followed by my studies(Guirardello 1992, 1993, 1994).",[21]
"However, a unified account is not possible, given the differences among the cases: the kenominalizer is phonologically different from the others, because it is bound: -ke. Thedifference is more transparent when -ke modifies a root ending in vowel, because in thiscase the allomorph used (-k) shows that the nominalizer is bound. The other two kemorphemes are insensitive to the last sound of the word they modify, as pointed outbefore.’ Also, ke relativizer shows some flexibilities that would not be expected with a
7 Actually, the case of nominalizations involving verbal roots ending in consonant is a little more
complicated, because the allomorph used is ke, which then generates ambiguity between the nominalizer
and the relativizer. That’s why sometimes it is hard to say if what we have is one ke or the other. In order to
distinguish them, we take in account the context of occurrences (root + ke inside an NP or verb in a clause).

On the other hand, the ke relativizer cannot be equated with the ke thatoccurs in clauses where the Absolutive NP is not preverbal, since this latter does not seemto have the function of a relativizer.","[207, 208]"

Thus,sometimes it is hard to tell if a clause in the affirmative modality is an existential or alocative/nominal predicate. The existential reading is preferred depending on theconversational context. For example:*4 This actually confirms a tendency already observed by Clark (1978): existential predicates tend to present
the order Loc Noun.

        ‘There are people in the woods.’

         use this clause with an existential reading when talking about strangers in the
        woods]

         clause with existential sense when pointing to fish in the river]
        The negative modality can be expressed through the use of a construction with thepostposition nik ‘without’:(100)   misu_ nik        ka_in        iyi.

Inexample (104) the lexical zero is due to discursive reasons, but the enclitic codifies the3rd person subject. As we will see in chapter 9, in several cases the absence of the encliticcan give to the clause a generic or existential sense (cf. section 9.1.1).","[235, 236, 237]"
"        Section 7.2. describes each argument type in detail; the interplay among the threeDative markers is also discussed {section 7.2.3.1). The final section of this chapter (7.3) isdedicated to the discussion of grammatical relations in Trumai. There is a discussionabout the traditional relations (7.3.1), followed by the presentation of an alternative wayof describing the Trumai system (section 7.3.2).
                                                                                             2557.1. Verb classes and obligatory participants         Trumai has four clause types: Intransitive, Transitive, Extended Intransitive andExtended Transitive’. Each type takes as required participants some combination of threeargument types: the Ergative, the Absolutive, and the Dative, each with its unique case-marking and each with distinct word order/constituency behavior.","[282, 283]"
"        One could suggest that ka can still be considered a verb, just like tao ‘order/giveorder’ is; in this case, one Ergative NP (the causer) would be an argument of ka, while theother Ergative NP (the causee) would be an argument of the causativized verb. However,if ka does not present verbal properties, how can we can call it a verb? If we say that ka isa main Transitive verb (like rao), it would be a very strange kind of verb. Therefore, the“solution” of classifying the Trumai causative construction as analytical does not presentany advantage; it only forces an inappropriate analysis onto the Trumai data in order topreserve a typological claim.",[339]
"        For clauses with Intransitive or Extended Intransitive verbs, when there is nolexical subject and the 3rd. person enclitic is omitted, the clause has a generic sense, withthe idea that some event is happening, but we cannot tell which entity is performing it(the event is described in a very vague way):         NPaps           Vv
(5)     iyi             ami   ka_in.
        ly!      speak Foc/Tens
        ‘There is something speaking.’ or ‘(It, something not identified) is speaking.’        NPats            V
(6)     iyi             ora    ka_in.
       IyI       crying Foc/Tens
        ‘There is something crying.’ or ‘(It) is crying.’         NPaps           V
(7)     iyi             sone ka_in.
        TY]             drink Foc/Tens
        ‘There is something drinking.’ or ‘(It) is drinking.’        The examples above could be analyzed as producing an effect similar to thepassivization that demotes Intransitive subjects, observed in some languages of the world
                                                                                          339
(such as Sanskrit or Dutch, which allow passivization of Intransitive verbs); that is,instead of describing that an entity is performing an event (‘something is speaking’), theclause would rather be a statement that an event exists: ‘there is speaking (by someindefinite entity)’. Notice that clauses that express natural phenomena or negativeexistential clauses also do not present a lexical subject nor the 3Abs enclitic:(8)     tsi-xu'tsa    ka_in         iyi.
        TsI-cold      _Foc/tens IYI
        ‘It is cold.’ (the weather)(9)     misu—   nik         ka_in          iyi.
        water without       Foc/Tens IYI
        ‘There is no water.’
        [if the clause had the Abs enclitic, its semantics would be different: “He does not
        have water.’]
        So, in some sense, examples (05-07) above are similar to negative existentialclauses or natural phenomena clauses in that neither has S morphology. However, theyare not the same; examples (05-07) cannot present the same word order as negativeexistential clauses (i.e. Pred Foc/Tens iyi):(10)    *ami ka_in iyi.
        (There is something speaking.)(11)     *sone ka_in iyi.
        (there is something drinking.)
        We still need to understand better the relationship between existential clauses andexamples such as (05-07). At the moment, what we can say with regard to the suppressionof the Absolutive argument in clauses with (Extended) Intransitive verbs is that this kind
                                                                                                              340of suppression produces a clause that has a generic sense, not providing informationabout the agent of the event that is described.’         The suppression of the Absolutive in clauses with Transitive or ExtendedTransitive verbs has a different semantic effect: antipassivization. Sometimes the verbdoes not present any sign of the Absolutive argument (i.e. no lexical Abs NP, no 3rd.person enclitic in the verb). This omission is observed when the patient/secondparticipant is not relevant for the main discourse, not definite, unimportant; therefore, itdoes not need to be mentioned. Examples:(12)     wan sa-tke-n-es,                  wan tete-n                         hen.
         PL dance-Des-3Abs-ES      PL make.beautiful-3Abs                      then
         ‘When they want to dance, they get painted.’         -ma       nuk hen!      -ina     hen, midoxos midoxos hen.
          let’s.go so then       - there then call         call       then
          “Let’s go!” - then, in  this occasion, they call  (other people, not defined here).’If the patient was definite or important, the clause would be:(13)     ina    hen,    wan midoxos midoxos-e hen.
         there then     PL call        call-3Abs then
         ‘Then, then, in this occasion, they call them.’                   [3p Absolutive enclitic is present]
' Another possible way of not expressing who is exactly the agent - giving the clause a generic/indefinite
sense - is to use the expression [yaw paine], which literally means ‘group of people’. A clause with [yaw
paine] can be translated as ‘they (indefinite) do X’:
(i)      yaw            paine sone wirix-ki.
         human.being group drink manioc.porridge-Dat
         ‘They (indefinite) drank the manioc porridge.’ or
         ‘The porridge was drunk (by somebody we do not know or do not want to say).”","[366, 367, 368]"
"       Alternation in word order between the auxiliaries is possible when there is little       difference in the semantic effect; otherwise, the order cannot be changed:(28)      hasone-tke-kma_        chi_in.
          1 drink-Des-Perf       Foc/Tens
           ‘I wanted to drink completely.’(29)      hasone-kma-tke         chi_in.

              [aspectual auxiliaries cannot combine freely if the semantic effect is strange]
e      Verb Direc - Direc: such a combination is frequently observed in texts, and often       involves the auxiliary ktsi ‘towards the interior of a location’. In this kind of       combination, the auxiliary ktsi is always final, perhaps because of iconicity (i.e. first       the person arrives at a location, then s/he moves towards its interior; the auxiliary ktsi
                                                                                                139       comes after the other Directional auxiliary in order to be iconic to the chronological       sequence of events). For instance:(31)       a. kikielka           hiwda-ktsi                               asuka-s.

"The grouping {S,A} as ‘Subject’ is understandable because, as Dixon points out, S and Arefer to functions that can be the agent. In contrast, the grouping {S,O} as ‘Subject’ isproblematic because O is not semantically an agent, it is a patient.'* Therefore, to say thatthe Absolutive is the Subject of a language with deep ergativity - such as Dyirbal - maynot be the best analysis. However, if in a language with deep ergativity S and A do not

"         The scenario is more complex when we use the same properties for identifying theSubject of languages whose case system is Ergative-Absolutive, because themorphological properties and the behavior-and-control properties can conflict. Manylanguages are Ergative in the morphology (with S and O aligning), but their syntax workson a Nominative-Accusative basis (i.e. for syntactic operations, S and A align). Then,how do we define the category of Subject for these languages? Which coding property ismore crucial for characterizing their Subject?",[316]
"       This endangerment is a part of what motivated me to study the Trumai language,and later to work with the community in order to develop a bilingual education programin the village schools. Although a bilingual school is not the solution for every problemthat the Trumai people are facing, at least it provides hope that something can be done tohelp preserve their cultural and linguistic knowledge.",[20]

5.2.5. Other kinds of non-verbal predicate
        In this section, we will consider the other possible kinds of predicate that are notverbal. They are: the equative predicate, the locative predicate, and the existentialpredicate. They can be considered subtypes of the nominal predicate, because their typicalorder is Pred Subj and the use of the Copula is frequent. However, each of thesepredicates has its own peculiarities that differentiate them from prototypical nominalpredicates and from each other. The following table presents the main similarities anddifferences among these predicates (for the comparison, we are excluding the Copula,which not always occur in the clause):
                                                                                                            207Table 5.3. Non-Verbal Predicates

The presenceof the Copula is not obligatory with 3rd person, but if used, it is always following theSubject, despite the variations in the order:”°                              Pred        ka_in      Subj (Cop)
                              Subj (Cop) ka_in Pred
                              * Subj     ka_in Pred Cop           As examples of equative clauses, we have:(85)      Aria che        yi ka_in                Tawapi chi.
          Aria husband YI Foc/Tens                Tawapit Cop
          ‘Tawapi is Aria’s husband.’

           ‘Aria’s husband is Tawapi.’ (lit: Tawapi (new info) is Aria’s husband).’
           [the general conversation is about Aria. Somebody asks about her husband]
           When in the negative modality, equative predicates can employ the negator anuk,but the use of the morpheme n(i)kik is preferred by the consultants (cf. chapter 6 foranalysis of this morpheme). We do not have examples with anuk in the order Subj Pred,
3 Actually, when the order is [Subj Cop Pred], the copula is conserved in nominal predicates. In equative
predicates, the copula can be absent.

only with n(i)kik (perhaps this is just a gap in the corpus; this point will be checked in thefuture).","[232, 233, 234]"
"        Comrie observes that some languages allow doubling on one of the positions inthe hierarchy (i.e. in some languages, in the causative of a Transitive verb the causee canbe marked as Accusative, resulting in a construction with two Accusatives). However, thedoubling respects the patterns observed elsewhere in the language (that is, doubling onobject would be possible for a language that allows other clauses to have two Accusativeobjects). According to Comrie, the possibilities for doubling of a specific grammaticalrelation would depend on its position in the hierarchy: the lower the position, the higherthe possibilities of doubling. As he points out (Comrie 1989:178), “doubling on subjectsis unknown in causative constructions; doubling on direct objects is attested, butrestricted; doubling on indirect object is very widespread”.",[338]

verbs, since the presence of only one argument makes it easier to analyze the organization of the clause. We
use Intransitive clauses as the basis for the comparison, but the facts presented here (i.e. position of enclitic;
word for negation) are also valid for Extended Intransitive and (Extended) Transitive clauses. When
necessary, we present information on these kinds of clauses too.
'S Nominal predicates can also present an alternative order (Subj Cop Pred), depending on pragmatic
factors:

             ‘His mother is me.’ (lit: I am (new info) his mother) (Q: Who is his mother?)
'6 As already mentioned in chapter 3 (section on Copula), there are actually two possibilities for the
nominal predicate:
(i) Occurrence of Copula:                        dika_in   chi-n.    ‘She is a woman.’
(ii) Occurrence of morpheme iyi:                 dika_in iyi-n.      ‘She is a woman.’The morpheme iyi/yi and the Copula cannot co-occur. Usually, the Copula is used, but when it does not
occur, the presence of iyi seems to be obligatory if the 3Abs enclitic -n/-e is used (iyi is the site where the
enclitic attaches).
""” Besides the use of anuk, which is more usual, there is an alternative way of expressing negation in
nominal predicates: the use of n(i)kik. See chapter 6, section 6.3.2.1.

utterances with both elements co-occurring.

5.2.2. Nominal roots as verb
          In chapter 2, we saw that a nominal root can function as a nominal word (‘an X’)or as a verbal word (‘to have an X’). If it functions as a verb, occurring in a verbalpredicate, it shows the behaviors observed with this kind of predicate (examples (b)below):Nominal vs. verbal, first person:
             Pred                  Subj Cop
(66)      adi            (ka_in)   ha       chi.                 ‘Tam a woman.’             Ss     V
          b. ha di ka_in.                                        ‘T am married.’ (said by man)
                                                                 (lit: I have a woman)Nominal versus verbal, third person:
            Pred                   Cop-subj
(67)      a.di     = (ka_in)       chi-n.                         ‘She is a woman.’             S_         V-subj
          b. iyi        di-n ka_in.                              ‘He is married’
                                                                 (lit: He has a woman).’5.2.3. Verbal predicate becomes similar to nominal predicate
          Sometimes both nominal and verbal predicates can become very similar in form,and that represents a problem of analysis. Basically, when the clause is an answer to aspecific question, and the verb codifies the new information or the information that needsto be confirmed, the clause has the structure of a cleft construction with the verb in focus.","[220, 221, 222]"
"       According to Givén (1997:29), behavior-and-control properties would reflectgrammatical relations more faithfully than morphology, because they are more directlymotivated by pragmatic factors, while morphology is not: “Being the mostgrammaticalized, ritualized or automated feature in grammar, morphology has a higherpotential for dissociation from semantic or pragmatic function, in this case the topicalityfunction of subjects and objects”.",[317]
"       Thus, for an Ergative language, the coding device that “least safely” leads us toidentify the category of Subject is the morphology, and that behavior-and-controlproperties can be more helpful. However, even in this case we need to be careful, becausethe Subject of the language under study may be little grammaticalized and may thereforenot show many properties even at the syntactic level.
