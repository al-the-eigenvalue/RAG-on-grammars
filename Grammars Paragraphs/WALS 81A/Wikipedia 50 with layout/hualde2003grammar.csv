4.3.3. Neutral order and focalizationThe adjective 'neutral' applied to the SOV order is intended to imply that no
constituent is emphasized for contrastive or emphatic purposes over the oth-
ers. Such 'focalization' gives rise to one of the most robust word order con-
straints in Basque, discussed at length in 4.4: foci (and wh-words) immedi-
ately precede the verbal element. The claim that SOV is the 'basic' word
order tries to capture the oft-noted intuition that while the preverbal object
in this order need not be interpreted as 'emphatic', any other preverbal ar-
gument in any other order (and perhaps the verb itself in the verb-initial or-
ders VSO and VOS) is usually construed as focalized. This is true even in
dialects where at least one constituent must bear focal stress (as in the
Lekeitio variety described in Hualde et al. 1994), since it is only a preverbal
object with focal stress that may be interpreted as informationally unem-
phatic.
    The Lekeitio facts correspond quite closely with Altube's (1929) descrip-
tion, which indicates that the latter is valid for at least some Bizkaian or
western dialects. The pattern described by Altube has become a quasi-
normative system followed, more or less consciously, by writers of the liter-
ary, unified dialect. The oral tradition of other dialects and the written prac-
tice before this century, established outside of the normativizing influence
of Altube's work, seems to have been different. Hidalgo (1995, 1999) points
out that postverbal focalized elements were common, rising to frequencies
higher than for preverbal foci the more complements and adjuncts are added
                                                                 Word Order   455
to the verb. The possibility of emphasizing constituents in different posi-
tions places fewer constraints on word order in such varieties.","[484, 485]"
"   Some fixed ordering phenomena seem to reflect the basic unmarked or-
der. Thus, when there is a constraint on the relative order of arguments, it is
always the subject-object order that is required. This is, for instance, the or-
der of interrogative pronouns in double wh-questions (4.4.6.3.1.2):(750) Eta     zure   prestutasunaz    ... nork zer         erranen   du?
        and   your   virtue.LNSTR            who    what   say.FUT   AUX
       'And about your virtue, who will say what?' [Ax. 2]Similarly, post-auxiliary focalization in negative clauses may affect any
element in immediate pre-participial position, but only constituents in their
neutral position may be interpreted as emphasized if not to the left of the
participle. Moreover, the focalized interpretation may 'spread' from the pre-
participial position to include other constituents provided that all of them
occupy their 'basic' neutral position (cf. 4.4.7.2.1 for a detailed discussion
of these constraints). The basic verb-final character of Basque may also be
seen in the fact that when the position of verbs is constrained, they are re-
quired to occupy a final position (as in relatives, and, more loosely, in some
other embedded contexts, see 4.10.2). Some processing strategies also rely
450 Syntax
on 'neutral' order templates. Thus, without a disambiguating context, abso-
lutive sequences are interpreted as subject-object sequences:(751) Jon Mikel        ari da      ikusten.
         Jon   Mikel   ari   AUX   see.lMPF
        'Jon is seeing Mikel.'","[479, 480]"
"The neutral order subject-indirect object-direct object is in a mirror image
relationship with respect to the markers which cross-reference these argu-
ments in the tensed verbal form.
                                                                 Word Order   449
   The 'neutral' positioning of dative nominale is in fact more complex than
Lafitte's template indicates. While it is true that datives precede absolutive
objects, they follow absolutive subjects. Thus, (a) is less marked than (b):(747) a. Jon sendagileari joan          zaio.
           Jon   doctor.DAT     go     AUX
         'Jon went to the doctor.'
      b. Sendagileari Jon joan zaio.","[478, 479]"
"
4.10.3.1.2. Word order within the relative clauseThere is a strong word order constraint regarding one constituent within the
relative clause: the relative clause must end with the finite verb form to
which the complementizer is joined. There is no exception to this rule. Even
in negative clauses, where, apart from relatives, the main verb and other
words generally follow the finite auxiliary, the inflected verb must appear at
the end of the relative clause (see 4.5 and 4.10.2.3).
   Consider the following example (a), which contains a negative relative
clause. Within this clause the last word is the inflected auxiliary to which
the complementizer is joined (zuen). The marker of negation (ez), although
written as a separate word in standard Basque, is a proclitic, and must pre-
cede the auxiliary:
                                                              Subordination 767
(1852) a.    [Altubek       kontutan         hartu     ezzueti]

             encounter
            Ί met with a basic distinction that Altube didn't take into ac-
            count.' [Mitx. EIG IV: 101]The word order found in the relative clause in (a) is not the one usually
found in sentences apart from relatives (see 4.5.2.1.2.1). In an ordinary
clause, the unmarked word order for the verbal expression in (a) would be
(b):       b.     Ez zuen          kontutan       hartu.
              no AUX           account.LOC take
            'He didn't take it into account.'","[796, 797]"
"   Similarly, more than one phrase could constitute new information or the
focus of the utterance, provided the right context. For instance, in a sentence
such as (7) the subject, indirect object and direct object could be the focus, if
the sentence were uttered in a situation in which it was apparent that some-
                                                                  Intonation   79
body bought something for somebody. Another possibility would be for the
indirect object and the direct object to be the focus of the utterance, if what
was known was that Miren gave something to someone, and we wanted to
know whom she gave what. What is important is that the same intonational
contour results in all cases, namely the one represented in Fig. 3.
   When the neutral or canonical order of constituents is altered, however,
the whole utterance or other phrases apart from the preverbal one cannot be
the constituents conveying new or focalized information. Only the preverbal
phrase can be interpreted that way (cf. A. Elordieta 2001). Thus, in a sen-
tence such as (8), where the direct object is postverbal, only the indirect ob-
ject can be interpreted as new or focalized information.","[108, 109]"
" Different orders produce different prominence configurations, the most im-
 portant of which, the focal interpretation of preverbal elements, is discussed
 in section 4.4.
    Most Basque grammarians have identified SOV as the 'neutral' or 'ba-
 sic' order (de Rijk 1969; Villasante 1980:17, also calls it 'aseptic'). Lafitte
 (1944:46) considers the sequence subject-adjunct-indirect object-direct ob-
ject-attribute-verb the 'neutral' or 'purely grammatical' style, as in the ex-
ample:(746) Aita       Sainduak atzo           bi       erresumeri   aphezpiku
        father holy.ERG      yesterday   two      nation.DAT   bishop

       ""The Holy Father sent yesterday a bishop to the two nations as media-
       tor.'",[478]
"
4.3. Word order
     J. Ortiz de Urbina4.3.1. Neutral orderThis section deals with word order at the clausal level, as opposed to order-
ing constraints inside phrases, which are discussed in the sections devoted
to the latter. While phrase internal order is largely fixed, phrase combination
is not rigid in Basque. All the permutations of the bracketed constituents in
the following example produce grammatical sentences in Basque:(745) [Ene aitak]            [amari]          fgona gorria]     [ekarri dio].
        my      father.ERG   mother.DAT       skirt   red.DET bring        aux
       'My father brought mother a red skirt.'",[478]
"
4.5.2.1.2. Finite embedded clauses4.5.2.1.2.1. DeclarativesIn embedded declarative clauses, the order of the constituents obeys two ba-
sic alternatives: in one, negation changes the basic relative order of the aux-
iliary and the lexical verb (1087a, b), as it does in matrix clauses. The com-
plementizer -ela is an affix on the finite auxiliary:(1087) a.  [Etorri dela]       esan didate.
           come     Aux.that say AUX
           'They told me that he/she came.'
        b. [Ez dela        etorri] esan didate.
           not AUX.that come say AUX
           'They told me that she/he didn't come.'
                                                                  Negation     523
In the other possible order, negation does not seem to change the basic rela-
tive order of auxiliary and lexical verb:(1088)    [Etorri ez dela]         esan didate.
          come     not Aux.that say AUX
          'They told me that she/he didn't come.'","[552, 553]"
"    The words or phrases responding to the question words sir 'what' and
nor 'who' are interpreted as the most important part of the sentence infor-
mationally, that is, as phrases that provide the necessary information that
fills the gap corresponding to the question word. In pragmatic terms, this
constituent is referred to as new information, rheme, or focus. Azkue and
Altube called this element the 'inquired element', referring to the corre-
spondence between this phrase and a presupposed question, and the position
immediately preceding the verb as the position of the inquired element. The
verb itself may be the most prominent element prosodically and semanti-
cally, as we will see below.
    But the focus or rheme of an utterance does not have to be triggered by a
question. It might appear in a sentence independently in a discourse, as the
speaker organizes and divides his/her utterances in parts carrying different
informational load: theme and rheme, old and new information, or topic and
focus. Like with answers to questions, the constituent that represents the
rheme, new information or focus of a sentence without being the answer to a
question appears immediately preceding the verb, at least in Northern Biz-
kaian varieties such as Lekeitio Basque (cf. also 4.4). In other varieties, fo-
calized or new information constituents can appear postverbally within a
78      Phonology
speaker's narrative discourse, but they must appear preverbally when they
constitute the answer to a wh-word in a preceding question (cf. section
4.4.8).
   It is important to point out that the preverbal constituent is not always in-
terpreted as the most prominent element informationally. A whole sentence
may constitute new information as well, if it is uttered out of the blue or as
an answer to a question such as 'What happened?', and reflects the canoni-
cal word order in Basque (S-IO-DO-V). In this case, it is still the word pre-
ceding the verb that receives the main prosodic prominence, without any
difference in pitch level or pitch excursion with respect to a sentence in
which the word or phrase preceding the verb constitutes new information.
Thus, if the sentence in (7) were the answer to a question such as 'What
happened?', or were uttered out of the blue, the pitch contour of the utter-
ance would be the same as if the preverbal phrase (i.e., the direct object
madari bat 'a pear') were the focalized constituent. The FO contour is illus-
trated in Fig. 3.","[107, 108]"
"
4.11.4.1. Gapping structures4.11.4.1.1. Forward and backward gappingIt has been posited (Ross 1970) that the direction in which gapping occurs
in a language depends on its word order. Consequently, for SOV and SVO
languages respectively, the next two patterns would be expected:   SVO + SVO    SVO + SO
   SOV + SOV -> SO + SOVThese two types have been called forward and backward gapping, respec-
tively. As for Basque, Gastanaga (1977) argues that it has two possibilities
for gapping (examples in Bizkaian dialect):(2217) Lindak         ardaua      edaten       dau            ta
         Linda.ERG    wine.DET    drink.lMPF    AUX.3A/3E     and
         Anderrek      esnea.
         Ander.ERG     milk.DET
        'Linda drinks wine, and Ander milk.'",[902]
"However, as noted in section 4.4.1, it is possible to emphasize more than
one constituent as a unit in pre-verbal position, in highly contrastive con-
texts. In that case, emphasized constituents must follow the neutral order
(Subjec-Adjuncts-Ind. Object-Dir. Object; cf. section 4.3), as if focalization
were spreading to bigger and bigger chunks of the basic structure:(967)    KOTXEA ETXEAN(*etxean kotxea)               utzi     nuen       atzo
         car       home.at                 leave AUX                     yesterday
        Ί left THE CAR AT HOME yesterday.'",[528]
"This is not restricted to intransitive subject clauses, as shown in the follow-
ing examples, where the embedded clause will not usually occur before the
verb unless focalized:(761) Konturatu        da      etxean      inor         ez      zegoela.
       realize         AUX     home.LOC    anybody      not     was.COMP
       'He realized that there was no one at home.'
                                                                         Word Order 453

        problem     is      sick           is.COMP
       'The problem is that s/he is sick.'","[482, 483]"
"
4.10.3.4.1.3. Word-order within the relativeThe position of the relative pronoun at the beginning of the relative clause is
obligatory, but the verb can appear in any position within the relative
clause. In (1963) above the verb follows the relative pronoun. In the exam-
ple below, it occurs at the end of the relative clause, preceded by the direct
object (Frantzia), and an adjunct clause:(1964)    ...gizon    bat, Napoleon,   [zeinak,
          man         one   Napoleon   which.DET.ERG
          gobernamenduari        fidelitatezko      juramentua
          government.DAT       loyalty.LNSTR.REL   oath
          egin    ondoan, Frantzia trahitu izan baitzuen].
          make after       France    betray be       COMP.AUX
         '...a man, Napoleon, who, after he swore to be loyal to the govern-
         ment, betrayed France.'",[843]
"Notice that clausal arguments of nominal predicates appear postposed in the
neutral order and, thus, the copulative verb intervenes between the nominal
predicate and the clausal argument. In equative constructions the verb also
intervenes between the two members of the equation. This ordering con-
trasts with the neutral order in predicative and equative constructions with
nominal arguments, in which the verb-final ordering is the most neutral one.

"On the contrary, in example (778) above, we find dummy egin substituting
for idatzx 'write', and taking an auxiliary which cross-references the plural
object 'tales' of this verb (ditu). Returning to cases like those in (781), it is
                                                                     Word Order 459
possible for the auxiliary of egin to register a dative argument, as long as it
can be construed as one of its own arguments ('do something to someone').
   Altube (1929:62) describes a related usage of egin where the action to
which this verb refers is focalized, rather than topicalized as in the previous
examples:(782) Horrek        [etxera     joan]     egin     du.
        that.ERG   home.ALL     go        do       AUX.TR
       'what that one did was go home.'","[488, 489]"
"The verb may also be topicalized and focused at the same time; the topical-
ized verb appears then in the citation form (participial):(792) Hartu     ere    har-tzen      dut   erabakia.
        take    also   take-lMPF     AUX   decision
       'As for taking, I TAKE my decision.' [Atx. Ob.: 111]Since hartu 'take' has been topicalized here, some element is expected to be
focalized; in this case the verb itself, which is then fronted inside its clause
(see 4.4.3.2.2 below). Topicalized verbs may be substituted by the dummy
verb egin 'do' inside the clause (4.3.4):(793) Saiatu    behintzat   egingo gara.
      try       at.least    do.FUT AUX
      'At least try, we WILL.' [Atx. Ob.:24]The tendency to have a focalized element in the presence of topicalized ma-
terial is also made responsible for the apparent need to focalize the verb in
the following sentences:(794) Jonek, behintzat, *(ba)daki.
       Jon       at.least     όα-knows
      'Jon, at least, does know.'
                                                               Focalization   461
The presence of behintzat 'at least' forces Jonek to be interpreted as a topic
(de Rijk 1978), and the existence of this focus forces in turn the synthetic
verb to receive focal interpretation, reflected here by the prefix ba- (see
4.4.3.2.2). However, this argument for the topic/focus relationship is weak-
ened if ba is interpreted not as a focus marker but as a particle supporting
the tensed verb, a clitic, in a context where no clausemate element to its left
is found (Ortiz de Urbina 1994). This situation emerges when the verb is
fronted to the left in focalization, but also if no other element is present in
the clause, as in the previous example.
   At least in some varieties of the language, SOV sentences need not have
a focalized constituent. The situation may be different in some dialects like
the Lekeitio variety described in Hualde et al. (1994), where all main
clauses must contain an element with focal stress. This is no doubt related to
the fact that most words lack lexical accent in this dialect. Even there,
though, an SOV sentence with focal stress on the object may receive both
object emphatic or neutral interpretation. On the other hand, neutral inter-
pretations are not found in clauses with a different word order.
   At the same time, it is possible to have more than one constituent focal-
ized. Just as two wh-words may cooccur in preverbal position, with paired
readings, two constituents may be emphasized with the same type of inter-
pretation:(795)    KOTXEA ETXEAN utzi        nuen atzo           (ez giltza
         car       at.home leave AUX yesterday not key
         bulegoan).
         office.the.in
        Ί left THE CAR AT HOME yesterday, not the key in the office.'","[490, 491]"
"The exception to this generalization comes from verbs of command/order,
which shall be studied in the next subsection:(1529)    *Haurrari kalera       bakarrik joatea...

"When the two adverb types cooccur, the most common order (in positions in
which both can appear) is sentential adverb-manner adverb in preverbal po-
sition, and the mirror image manner adverb-sentential adverb in postverbal

4.3.2. Heavy constituentsAs in English, heavy elements, especially clauses, tend to occur to the right
in Basque (Hidalgo 1996). Thus, while the neutral position of nominal ob-
jects is the preverbal one, that of clausal objects can be postverbal. As a re-
sult, the SVO order need not contain a focalized subject when Ο is a clause
(see also 4.10.1.1.1.8):(758) Jonek           esan du       Mikelek       erlojua     galdu
        Jon.ERG       say    AUX    Mikel.ERG     watch,      lose

the focalized constituents. In any event, outside of cases like 'From where
to where', this focalization strategy is found in highly contrastive contexts.
    Multiple wh-questions can be formed by coordinating wh-words:(797) Noiz eta nola sortua da Sail              hori?
       when and how born          is section that

      'When (and) where did you hear it?' [Lafitte 1944:224]Stacked foci and questions must be placed in an order corresponding to the
 'neutral' order; thus, in (799) the order zer nork 'what who' and the order
etxean kotxea 'at home the car' in (795) would not be acceptable. See sec-
tion 4.4.6 for pre-verbal foci and wh-words coexisting with yet other such
elements in different positions in the sentence.
    Some morphological and syntactic devices produce emphasis which
quite often results in syntactic focalization of the marked constituent. Thus,
demonstratives and some adverbials may be attached the suffix -xe: horixe
'that very one', hementxe 'right here', oraintxe 'right now'; pronouns have
special intensive forms: ni Τ vs. neu Ί myself, zu 'you' vs. zeu 'you your-
self; adjectives may be reduplicated for emphasis: zuri-zuria 'very white',
handi-handia 'very big'; phrases can also be emphasized by adding the de-
monstrative bera in apposition, marked with the same ending: Jonek berak

While elements thus marked are perfectly felicitous in pre-verbal position,
there seems to be some variation as to whether they can appear in non-focus
position. Many speakers reject intensive pronouns in non-focus position,
and the same is often reported for elements marked with the intensive
marker -xe (de Rijk 1978:106). However sentences like the following are
certainly acceptable for many speakers:(801)    Orain irakurri dituzun         liburu horiexek    nik
         now      read      AUX.COMP book      those.LNTS I.ERG

It seems therefore that, at least for some of these strategies, emphasis need
not correspond to syntactic focalization.
    Echo-questions usually respect left-adjacency with the verb, so that the
wh-word, rather than occupying the position it would in the basic declara-
tive sentence, is typically moved to the pre-verbal position:(802) -Zugandik atera dira kontu zikin guzti horiek.

       -Nigandik ZER atera dela?

4.10.1.1.3. Subjunctive clauses headed by -en and -ela There are verbs and predicates in Basque which require that the verb of the
 complement clause they select be in the subjunctive mood; these include vo-
 litional verbs like nahi 'to want', behar 'to need', espero 'to hope', etc., and
 emotive, effective (= influence and order/command) verbs like agindu
 'command', debekatu 'forbid', erabaki 'decide', erregutu 'beg, urge', esan
 'tell' itself, eskatu 'ask, demand', galarazi 'forbid', gomendatu 'recom-
mend', opatu 'wish', proposatu 'propose' and utzi 'permit' and predicate
 adjectives (or nouns) like ona! txarra/ askil harrigarria/ zilegil beharrez-
koa! ordul beldur... izan 'be good, bad, enough, surprising, licit, necessary,
time, afraid (literally 'fear')...'. The most common complementizer for sub-
junctive clauses is -em(1464) Euskara        Euskal Herri      osoan      ofiziala izan

"In fact, Hualde et al. (1994) report, that, in the Lekeitio dialect, this is virtu-
ally the only context where the preverbal element need not bear focal stress
(see 4.3.3 below). Al tube (1929) also mentions this order as occurring quite
frequently in the language, even though, from a normative perspective, he
considered it ill-formed.
   The tendency for heavy, clausal elements to occur to the right is more
marked with subjects of copulative predicates, as pointed out by Zabala
(2000):(759) Egia            da tenperatura      konstantea          dela.
        truth.DET     is    temperature   constant.DET        is.COMP
       'It is true that the temperature is constant.'",[482]
"
4.5.2.1.2.4. Subjunctive complementsSubjunctive complements, which in Basque require the same complemen-
tizer as relatives and interrogative complements (see 4.10.1.1.3), also show
two alternative orderings with negation:(1101) a.  Gehiago etor      ez zedin agindu nion.
           more      come not AUX order          AUX
           Ί ordered him/her not to come anymore.'
        b. Ez zedin gehiago etor, agindu nion.
           not AUX more           come order    AUX
           Ί ordered him not to come anymore.'",[556]
"And leaving aside a small set of modal and evidential particles (3.5.7), noth-
ing can intervene between the lexical verb and the auxiliary:(1069)    * erori etxea daThe presence of negation however induces changes on this basic word order
pattern. The presence of negation forces the auxiliary to merge with it, and
precede linearly the lexical verb:(1070) Etxea ez da erori.",[548]
"
4.10.3.3.7. Some characteristics of headless relative clauses4.10.3.3.7.1. Word order within headless relative clausesAs seen above, there is a strong word order constraint in relative clauses:
the inflected verb must be the last constituent within the relative (see
4.10.3.1.2), and no other constituent can be extracted out of the relative (see
4.10.3.1.4.3). This constraint, however, is dramatically lightened when the
relative is a headless relative to which the determiner and case ending is di-
808 Syntax
rectly joined. Indeed, in such cases, extraction is not blocked, provided the
extracted elements immediately follow the verb:(1954) Ithorrotzen        ikusi dut Benat Berterreix
        Ithorrotz.LOC see       AUX Benat Berterreix
         [Lafittekin    ibili dena          eskolan].
        Lafitte.C0M walk AUX.COMP.DET school.at
       Ί saw in Ithorrotz Benat Berterreix who went to school with La-
       fitte.' [Arb. Pia:26]In (1954), there is no discontinuous constituent, but the last constituent
within the phrase containing the appositive relative (between brackets) is
not the inflected verb, to which the determiner is joined (dena), but the loca-
tive NP (eskolan 'at school'). This is especially likely when the relative is
long and contains many or complex constituents:(1955) Ikusiko     dugu   badirela       nolanahiko      izakiak,         (...),
         see.FUT   AUX    ba.are         anyhow.REL      beings

         women             not   only     not   male.DET.PL       and

        'We will see that there are beings of many kinds, (...), which not
        only are neither men nor women, but even neither male nor female'.
        [Mitx. EIG VI: 180]In the preceding example, the headless relative is a complex negative sen-
tence. If the inflected verb were at the end of the relative the example would
be incomprehensible.","[837, 838]"
" Verb glosses
Verbal inflection in finite verbal forms is also glossed in detail only where
 directly relevant. Since the only relevant information, outside the chapter on
 verbal morphology itself, is person agreement (including person, case and
number morphemes) only that information is specified. Unless PL 'plural' in
explicitly marked, 'singular' is the default value. We have tried to represent
person agreement information in the order in which it appears on the verb.
Thus, subjects will be variously marked to the right or to the left, depending
on whether they are cross-referenced by the ergative or the absolutive
marker. Person morphemes are separated by slashes from each other in
pluripersonal agreement forms. Mood is only marked when the potential or
hypothetical marker -ke is present or when the subjunctive auxiliary is se-
lected, if directly relevant. Where none of this is relevant, only 'AUX' has
been indicated. Full information is given in 3.5.2.
    As for aspect information, following Basque grammatical tradition, we
gloss perfective participles as infinitives. This is so because they work as
the unmarked, citation form of the verb. Thus, a form like hartu is glossed
as 'take'. Similarly, the future morpheme -ko is added to this citation, parti-
cipial form, and we gloss hartuko as take.FUT, disregarding again the 'per-
fective' aspect marker -tu-. The auxiliary izan 'be' reinforcing perfective
tenses (3.5.4.2.1) or inserted to provide a verbal host for aspectual markers
in verbal locutions (3.5.4.2.2) is always glossed as 'be' regardless of its
grammatical function.
    The perfective present form ikusi dut can be translated as a present per-
fect of simple past in English. Both translations are given for this tense
throughout the grammar. The different tense values are described in 3.5.4.
Finally, some verbal expressions can be analyzed as regular verb+auxiliary

combinations or as noun/adjective + 'be, have' periphrases: bizi naiz Ί live,
be alive', nahi dut Ί want, have desire'. We have maintained the different
authors' preferences in this area.

                             Introduction
                                J. I. Hualde1.1. The Basque language and its nameThe word 'Basque' derives, through French, from the name of the Vas-
cones, a nation or tribe that in Roman times occupied an area of the Iberian
Peninsula including most of present-day Navarre and neighboring parts of
Aragon. Whereas, on the one hand, possibly not all Vascones were Basque-
speaking (both non-Indo-European Iberian and Indo-European Celtiberian
appear to have been used in parts of their territory) and, on the other hand,
Pre-Basque and related languages seem to have been also spoken by some
other neighboring nations (at least the Aquitanians in Gaul, see Gorro-
chategui 1995), in medieval times the name Vascones became identified
with the speakers of the direct ancestor of the language we know as Basque.
The traditional name for the Basque language in Spanish is vascuence, de-
rived from Latin uasconice '(to speak) in the Vasconic way', which is paral-
lel to and was opposed to romance < romanice 'in the Roman way'. In post-
Renaissance Spain, the name vizcaino, strictly speaking only the western-
most dialect of Basque, became for several centuries a frequent designation
for the Basque language and its speakers.
    The Basques call their language euskara (and dialectal variants: euskera,
eskuara, iiskara, auskera, etc.). Euskara is opposed to erdara (or erdera)
'foreign language', used to refer to Spanish on the southern side of the po-
litical border and to French on the other side. Both words have an ending
which very likely derives from the word era 'manner', used as a suffix in
many words, such as ibilera 'way of walking' (from ibil-i 'to walk'), etc. In
erdara the first element appears to be erdi 'half. Etymologically erdara
would thus be 'a half way of speaking', 'something that is not fully a lan-
guage'; a not unusual way to characterize a foreign language. On the other
hand, the original meaning of the root eusk- in euskara is less clear. Among
the proposed etymologies we find the name of the Ausci, a Pyrenean tribe in
Roman times, and the reconstructed verb *enau(t)s-i 'to speak' (Irigoyen
1977, 1990).
2 Introduction
    Basque speakers refer to the land where their language is spoken as
Euskal Herria (euskal = compositional form of euskara + herri 'country' +
-a 'singular determiner') 'country of the Basque language' and to them-
selves as euskaldunak 'those who have the Basque language' (euskal- +
-dun 'possessing' + -ak 'plural determiner').
   In the first decades of the 20th century, the eminent Basque politician and
not-so-eminent philologist Sabino Arana Goiri (1865-1903) and his follow-
ers changed the spelling to euzkera in the (mistaken) belief that this word
must be related to eguzki (dialectal euzki) 'sun', on the Classical Greek
model that sought a connection between Hellen and helios. Related coinages
of that vintage are the words Euzkadi 'Basque Country', later reformed as
Euskadi, the adjective euzko (later eusko) 'Basque, in an ethnic or political
sense' and euzkotar (later euskotar) 'Basque citizen; ethnic Basque'. The
truly great and very influential Basque linguist Luis Michelena (in Basque
Koldo Mitxelena) promoted the use of some of these neologisms to preserve
the traditional link between euskal and the Basque language. His wish was
to avoid the misuse of words like euskaldun, which traditionally can only
mean 'Basque speaker', as 'Basque citizen'. He succesfully campaigned for
terms like Eusko jaurlaritza 'Basque government' instead of Euskal jaur-
laritza, which in the Sprachgeflihl of traditional Basque speakers could only
mean something like 'Government of the Basque language' (see Michelena
1984).","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]"
"In fact, quantifiers such as gutxi behave similarly to focus operators in that
they induce a change in the basic word order of the clause. Those quantifi-
ers must occupy the preverbal position, irrespective of their grammatical
function (see 4.4.2):
546 Syntax
(1166) a. Jende gutxik      ikusi du       hori.
          people few.ERG see        AUX that
          'Few people saw that.'
       b. *Jende gutxik      hori ikusi du.
           people few.ERG that see AUX
          'Few people saw that (intended).'","[575, 576]"
"Similarly, word order is not fixed if more than one wh-word occurs post-
verbally, and other elements may intervene between wh-words:(975) Nork            ekarri   dio   zer       nori?
        who.ERG       bring    AUX what       who.to
        'Who brought what to whom?'
500   Syntax
(976) Nork ekarri dio nori zer?
      'Who brought what to whom?'","[529, 530]"
"In the case of agindu, the translations and the glosses make it clear that the
dual subcategorization goes hand in hand with a change in interpretation:
agindu requires a nominalized clause case-marked with absolutive if the in-
tended meaning is roughly 'promise'; it selects a -t(z)eko complement when
it has a command interpretation ('order'). As for eskatu, the difference is
harder to grasp: when it takes a plain nominalization, it is roughly equiva-
lent to request or ask for (a particular choice), and it is usually a subject-
control verb: in the example at hand, the subject of the nominalization is
null and interpreted as coreferential with the subject of the main clause. If
the -t(z)eko complement is selected, then the interpretation is similar to de-
mand, and there may or may not be control: in (1558b) above, the subject of
emateko can be an arbitrary third person or eskolak 'classes' itself (in the
latter case, the entire constituent is interpreted as an impersonal sentence);
but, if there is control, it will be object control:
674 Syntax
(1559) a. Eskolak        Leioako       campusean       ematea
              classes    Leioa.REL     campus.LOC      give.ΝΟΜ.DET
              eskatu    dit.
              ask       AUX.3A/1D/3E
           'S/he requested ('to me') teaching the classes at the Leioa cam-
          pus.'
        b. Eskolak Leioako        campusean        emateko
            classes Leioa.REL campus.LOC give.tzeko
            eskatu    dit.
            demand AUX
           'S/he asked me to teach the classes at the Leioa campus.'","[703, 704]"
"It is possible to extract multiple wh-words to the pre-verbal position of a
higher clause. In such case the wh-complex will also occur in a fixed order
identical to the neutral one:(979) Nork         zer    esan dute ekarri            duela?
         who.ERG what say       AUX bring             AUX.COMP
        'Who did they say brought what?'",[530]
"
4.5.2.1. Finite clauses4.5.2.1.1. Matrix finite clauses4.5.2.1.1.1. DeclarativesThe standard word order in a Basque finite clause has the auxiliary follow-
ing the verb:(1068) a. Etxea erori da.       b. *etxea da   erori
          house fall     AUX         house AUX fall
          'The house has fallen down.'",[548]
"As the examples above show, the dependent clauses are all headed by a
complementizer to which the partitive morpheme is attached. Laka (1992)
proposes that polarity items in dependent clauses are directly licensed by the
complementizer+partitive complex. In fact, the partitive morpheme would
be the phonological spell out of a polar feature that licenses the negative
words and which is selected by the matrix clause. The partitive morpheme,
however, only occurs in a subset of the contexts that license a negative po-
larity item in a dependent clause: epistemic verbs or verbs of speech. In
those contexts, -enik (the complex complementizer+partitive) stands in con-
trast to the simple declarative complementizer, which forces a factive read-
ing of the dependent clause. Subjunctive dependents of verbs of wish and
558   Syntax
command do not take the partitive morpheme, and also allow negative po-
larity items:(1201) a. Ez dut nahi [inor          etor        dadiri].
           not AUX want anyone c o m e ( R A D ) AUX(SUBJ).COMP
          Ί don't want anyone to come.'
       b. Ez diot agindu [ezer           eros
                not     AUX    order   anything   buy(RAD)
                dezari],
                AUX(SUBj).COMP
               Ί didn't order him to buy anything.'","[587, 588]"
"However, in marked sentences where some other element is focalized, their
position is freer:
                                                                        Word Order 451

         'It was the last exam that Jon completed well.'
      b. JONEK burutu zuen azken azterketa ondo.
         'it was Jon who completed the last exam well.'","[480, 481]"
"To express the intended meanings, nonfinite clauses may be used (see
4.10.1.2).
650 Syntax
   Expressions like ez dit ardura/axola Ί don't care', which require an er-
gative subject in many dialects, admit sentential subjects in the form of indi-
rect questions.
   There is no restriction for subject sentences to the verbs or predicates that
are not transitive, i.e. that do not require an ergative NP:(1489) a. Ageri      da deus      onik     ez dezaketela igurik.
            apparent is anything good.PRTT not AUx.ela     wait(RAD)
          'It is apparent that they cannot hope for anything good.'

           'For it is not all that sure that those who promised a retirement will be
           able to stick to their word for a long time.' [H.U. Gontz·:36]
        c. Garbi ageri          zen gaizki-esaleak ugariagoak

             'It was evident that the detractors were more than those who regarded
             it [the movie] as good.' [Mitx. EIG 1:165]We leave open whether these subject sentences are indeed true subjects or
object clauses.
   With respect to object clauses, one should point out that there exist a few
verbs that subcategorize for finite complement clauses even though they se-
lect an intransitive auxiliary; the list includes verbs like konturatu, ohartu
'realize' and gogoratu 'remember'. We provide some illustrating examples:(1490) a.    Horretaz         konturatzen/ohartzen/gogoratzen                     naiz.

             [EH:606]   Finite clauses cannot be dative case-marked either; thus, verbs that re-
quire a dative complement can only resort to a nominalization in order to
have a clausal complement (see 4.10.1.2.1.1 below):(1491) a.   Jonek       diruari         garrantzia  ematen       dio.

4.10.3.1.5. Accessibility4.10.3.1.5.1. Accessibility hierarchyWhen a noun phrase can be relativized in a clause, it is said to be accessible
to relative-clause formation. Most of the time, accessibility to relativization
is understood according to the morphosyntactic features of the relativized
NP, and this is the way we take it here.
    Basque is an SOV language which uses a gapping strategy for the relativ-
ized phrase. Such languages typically have constraints on accessibility, and
so we expect to find constraints in Basque. It is easy to understand how rela-
tivization may appear rather difficult in these circumstances, since the rela-
tivized phrase, which includes the case-ending, has no overt realization
within the relative clause. Notice, however, that in those cases where the re-
lativized NP agrees with the verb, verb-agreement can be considered as a
kind of resumptive realization of the relativized phrase. Such a situation can
appear in Basque with ergative, absolutive and dative phrases.
    It is generally admitted that accessibility displays the following syntactic
hierarchy (cf. Keenan & Comrie [1977, 1979]:(1863) subject > direct object > indirect object > adverbialThis hierarchy is the one which is found in Basque, as we will presently
show.
   First, let us see how the syntactic hierarchy shown in (1863) could be ex-

The hierarchy of (1863) is modified in (1864) because a) no superiority re-
garding accessibility seems to appear in Basque between subjects and ob-
jects, b) subcategorized adverbial phrases are easier to relativize than ad-
junctive adverbial cases. The interpretation of (1864) is as follows:- Ergative and absolutive NPs can always be relativized without any kind of
restriction, and no hierarchy seems to exist between them in inflected rela-
tives.","[804, 805]"
"4.10.1.2.2. Other non-finite structures based on the verbal nounThere are three kinds of non-finite structures based on the verbal noun:
those based on the verbal noun followed by the relational postposition -ko\
those based on the same verbal noun followed by the bare locative ending
-n\ and those based on the verbal noun followed by the allative suffix -ra(t).
The reason for studying these three separately is that it is hard to maintain a
[t(z)e + case suffix] analysis from a synchronic point of view in the case of
the first two structures. Most grammarians list or mention them as separate
'complementizers' or subordinating elements, and they do indeed have idio-
syncratic properties (i.e. properties which do not seem to follow from a
noun + case suffix analysis). This leads us to regard them as separate subor-
dinators altogether. We have included nominalized clauses with the allative
                                                                        Subordination   671
suffix -ra(t) in this separate subsection because this ending alternates with
-t(z)en in some dialects.
4.10.1.2.2.1. -t(z)eko complementsAlthough the sequence -t(z)eko is decomposable into the nominalizing affix
followed by the relational suffix, it is better considered as a chunk from a
synchronic perspective. This is the form that most command/order verbs se-
lect as their non-finite complement; it is also the form to report a command
expressed without an auxiliary verb:(1552) a.   Ez ardorik         edan!
            not wine.PRTT drink
           'Don't drink wine!'

4.8.2. Causee marking in morphological causativesThis section is devoted to causee marking in morphological causatives,
where the logical subject caused to act may not occur as a subject. This
grammatical function is taken over by the causer, which, if expressed, will
appear in the ergative case. The causee, on the other hand, will take on ab-
solutive or dative marking. The dialectal and argumental factors which rule
the usage of one case marking versus the other are discussed in the follow-
ing sections. We will examine the case marking of the causee ('logical sub-
ject') of intransitive, monotransitive and ditransitive predicates. In order to
make case marking patterns in the examples more illustrative, pronouns are
provided in cases where the nominal would have been dropped in actual
use. These pronouns are inserted in square brackets in corpus examples and
in parentheses in constructed examples.",[626]
"
4.10.3.2.2. Adverbial participial relativesIn adverbial participial relatives the participle receives an adverbial suffix,
which is either the partitive marker (-[r]i£) or -ta. Then, the relational suffix
(-ko) is joined to the adverbial form in order to make it adnominal. With the
partitive we get -(r)ikako {-[r]ika + ko) in Navarrese-Lapurdian, and -(r)iko
(-[r]ik + ko) in Bizkaian, as shown in the following examples:(1910)    [liranja eta        zitroin     lorez          eginikako]
          orange       and    lemon       flower.iNSTR   make.PTCP.REL
          usain gozo bat
          smell good a
         'a good smell made of orange and lemon flowers' [Etch. Mend. :71](1911)    [ondo landuriko]                    soro,      baratza   ta
          well     cultivate.PTCP.REL         meadow     garden    and
          sagastitxo         batzuk
          orchard.DiM        some.PL
         'some meadows, gardens and little orchards which are well culti-
         vated' [Ag.A><?i.:51]In western dialects, and especially in Gipuzkoan, the suffix used for adver-
bialization of the perfect participle is -ta. When the participial clause is ad-
nominalized, it is again followed by the relational suffix -ko. This is the
most usual form of participial relatives in southern dialects:(1912)    [berak   bakarrik             egindako]        erakusketan
         he.ERG    alone.PRTT make.PTCP.REL              exhibition.LOC
         'in the exhibition that he himself put together' [Mitx. EIGIX: 144]Regarding accessibility, it should be observed that direct objects are easier
to relativize than subjects in transitive participial relatives. Relativization of
792   Syntax
transitive subjects is allowed, but it is the marked interpretation in ambigu-
ous contexts:(1913)    atzo       ikusitako     gizonak
          yesterday see.PTCP.REL men
          'the men who saw X yesterday'Sentence (1913), where neither the subject nor the object is realized, is am-
biguous. Both interpretations are possible, but the second one, where the re-
lativized NP is the object, is the unmarked one. Indeed relativization of er-
gative NPs in transitive clauses is difficult to accept for many speakers out
of an appropriate context.
    When the object NP is not gapped within the relative clause there is no
ambiguity and relativization is more readily accepted:(1914) a.      atzo        nik    ikusitako     gizonak
               yesterday I.ERG see.PTCP.REL men
               'the men I saw yesterday'
         b.    atzo        ni ikusitako     gizonak
               yesterday I see.PTCP.REL men
               'the men who saw me yesterday'Adverbial NPs too can be relativized in participial relatives:(1915) zu     jaiotako          herria
       you born.PTCP.REL       country
       'the country where you were born'
4.10.3.2.3. Infinitival relativesIn so-called infinitival relatives the nominalized verb of the relative clause
receives the relational suffix -ko, as in the following example:(1916)    Donos tia(...) [euskalduntasuna desegiteko]
          Donostia        basquehood            destroy.NOM.REL
          tresna bat da.
          tool     a    is
         'San Sebastian (...) is a tool to destroy basquehood.' [Mitx. IH:131]
                                                                Subordination 793
In fact the syntactic status of these adnominal clauses is not clear, and it
isn't sure that we have to analyze them as relative clauses. The alternative
analysis consists of considering them as adnominal complement clauses
subcategorized by different classes of nouns. In traditional grammars these
adnominal clauses have received no specific analysis, and the proposal to
consider them as relative clauses appears in modern linguistics works (Arti-
agoitia 1992). An example illustrating the relative clause analysis is (1917):(1917)    [Trafikoa zaintzeko]          ertzainak     heldu   dira.
         traffic      direct.NOM.REL policemen        arrive AUX
         'Policemen to direct the traffic have arrived.'","[821, 822, 823]"
"If we try to keep the word order of (b) within a relative clause, the result is
absolutely unacceptable, because the last word within the relative clause is
not the inflected verb to which the complementizer is suffixed:       c.    *[Altubek      ez     zuen       kontutan      hartu]
             Altube.ERG     not AUX.COMP      account.LOC   take

             topo.
             encounter
4.10.3.1.3. Modifier and relative stackingAll kinds of noun modifiers can be used on a par with relatives: genitive
phrases, adnominal adverbial phrases, adjectives, quantifiers, etc. Usually,
prenominal relatives appear as the leftmost constituent, and postnominal
relatives as the rightmost lexical phrases within the relative. Hence,
prenominal relative clauses generally precede other adnominal phrases as in
(1853) below:
768   Syntax
(1853) Jendea            ere gutiago          akituko      zen   (...)     egon

             stone.lNSTR.REL        benches.LOC
         'People too would have been less tired, if they had been sitting on
         the stone benches which are on both sides of the square.'
         [Etch. 5wr.:108]In (1853) there is an adverbial adnominal phrase (harrizko 'of stone') be-
tween the relative clause and the head noun.
   In postnominal relatives the relative clause usually follows adjectives as
(1851) above. But the reverse order, although marked, can be found:(1854) a.       Holako                  gezur      [xutik              doatzi-n]
                that.type.REL           lie        standing.up         go-COMP
                izigarriek         ez         lukete         nehork          hitzik

                answer.NOM.DET                merit
               'These awful lies, which are self-evident, don't deserve any-
               body answer a word (lit. lies which go standing up).' [H.U.
               72:107]In (a) the relative clause is followed by an adjective (izigarri 'frightening').
Right-branching and left-branching relatives can be stacked, as in the fol-
lowing example:        b.      Benatek            erran        dizkit       [sekula         asmatuko
                Benat.ERG          tell         AUX          never           dream.FUT
                ez    nituen]         gauza    harrigarri     \jende
                not AUX. COMP         thing    amazing        person

                normal     a         tell    not     AUX.POT.COMP-DET.PL
               'Benat told me amazing things that I would have never
               thought up (and) that a normal person cannot say.' [Land:81]
                                                             Subordination   769
In (b) we observe that the first relative precedes the head noun (gauza
'thing'), but the second one follows it (and the adjective harrigarri 'amaz-
ing ').
   Relatives can also be stacked on the same side of the noun, and espe-
cially on the left side, where relative clauses usually occur:       c.    Zortzigarren    errenkada     da    [berilo    deitzen
             eighth          row           is    beryl      call.lMPF

             stone           beautiful       one
            'The eighth row is (made of) a beautiful stone that gets close
            to green (and) that is called beryl.' [Agi.Ast.:351]Though grammatically perfect, stacking of relative clauses is stylistically
marked, since it is difficult for speakers to process more than two or three
stacked relatives in a natural way, especially when the information given is
not already known.
   Of course, relative clauses can also be coordinated within the same NP, a
known exception to the Coordinate Structure Constraint (see below
4.10.3.1.4.3). This is what the following two examples show. The relative
clauses are between brackets:(1855) a.    kontua    da      nola   deitu     behar    ditugun
             problem   is      how    call      need     AUX.COMP

               [Mitx. EIG IV:55]Relative clauses can contain NPs which include relatives. In the following
example, a relative clause is within the dative phrase which belongs to an-
other relative clause:(1856) a.       Bibliofilia (..).   diru      asko    duen
                bibliophilism       money     much    has.coMP

               'Bibliophilism is a craze that corresponds to people who have
               a lot of money.' [Mitx. EIG IV:58]There is no limit to the number of ordinary relatives which can be added in
this way. For instance in the following example the writer uses recursion to
obtain a certain literary effect in a dialogue between a sheep and a shepherd.
We don't give a word-for-word translation of the example, but we number
the embedded relative clauses. Epglish presents the same stacking on the
right side and thus in the reverse order; the first head noun is underlined.      b. Ai ardia, indartsua zara, [[[[[[[[[gatibatu nauen 9] elurra urt-

In spite of examples like the preceding one, it should be said that Basque
speakers have difficulties to process sentences where more than two or three
relative clauses are embedded within each other. This fact has been ob-
served in other languages using left-branching relatives.","[797, 798, 799, 800, 801]"

2.3.3.2. Intonational division of an utteranceOne important word-order feature that distinguishes the variety of Baztan
from the varieties of Tolosa and Lekeitio is that main prosodic prominence
can appear postverbally more frequently in Baztan than in the other two va-
rieties. When the whole utterance is new information, not only in narratives
but also as an answer to a question such as 'What happened?\ the constitu-
ent with the most prominent pitch accent appears postverbally. Thus, an an-
swer to the question 'What happened?' could be the one in (57):

       'Have you heard how our neighbors from Beam themselves praise
       their language?' [Etch. Id. 1:200]The last two examples show that verb-fronting may cooccur with the inter-
rogative particle al as well as the yes/no marker -a. As usual, a clause-initial
verb may be preceded in turn by any number of topicalized/scrambled ele-
ments and a focalized constituent. Since subjects tend to be topics and ob-
jects are often focalized (see Hualde et al.1994), this means that it is not
clear whether SOV sentences like the following exclusively involve inter-
rogative intonation on a neutral word order or whether the object has been
focalized:(824) Baina       entzuleak       egilearen      esan-rtahi    berbera
        but       listener.ERG    author.GEN     meaning       same

synthetic verbs. These are clitic-like elements which lean on the element to
their left and which cannot therefore occur in absolute initial position in a
main clause. Where verb-fronting to that position takes place, they are sup-
plemented by the particle ba to their left:(826)    Ba al dugu musikan euskal         eskolarik?
         ba al have music.in Basque school.PRTT
        'Do we have any Basque school in music?' [Mitx. EIG 1:49](827) Ba      al   duzue    idazlanik            aski?
         ba   al   have     manuscript.PRTT    enough
        'Do you have enough manuscripts?' [Mitx. EIG 1:83]Topics may occur to the left of the initial verb, which will then also appear
with ba- (828); however, this is not the case if a focalized constituent pre-
cedes it: that constituent 'counts' as first element to support the synthetic
verb, as in (829):(828) Euskal doinuek       ba al dute        berezkotasunik?
       Basque songs.ERG ba al have peculiarity.PRTT
      'Do Basque songs have any peculiarities?' [Mitx. EIG 1:48](829)   Kaltegarritzat     al daukazue   joera           hori?

        'Do you consider that tendency harmful?' [Mitx. EIG 1:86]
4.4.3.2. Verb FocalizationVerb focalization stands out from the main focalization strategy described
in the preceding sections in that it seems to employ, at least in part, different
mechanisms. Since Altube (1929), a distinction has been drawn between
two types of 'verb focalization': a) cases where the event itself is empha-
sized, contrasting it with other type of events, and b) cases where 'the posi-
tive or negative quality of the verb is emphasized', i.e. where what is em-
phasized is that the action or state did take place or is true, as opposed to not
taking place or not being true. A priori, the contrastive overtones of the for-
mer seem more akin to the types of constituent focalization discussed in
section 4.4.2, while positive verbal emphasis falls fully in line with the
yes/no questions discussed in 4.4.3.1 However, both types of verb focaliza-
470 Syntax
tion will be discussed in this section in order to prevent dispersion and to
facilitate a sharper distinction between the two. Contrastive event focaliza-
tion will be dealt with in 4.4.3.2.1, and 4.4.3.2.2 will be devoted to polar
emphasis. Since negation presents additional problems which will be exam-
ined in section 4.4.7 below, we will concentrate here on positive polar em-
phasis.","[497, 498, 499, 500]"
"    To sum up, negation occurs immediately preceding the nonfinite verb,
with the exception of -t(z)eko complements and adjuncts formed with arren
and the like, which also admit other possibilities; -t(z)eko complements ad-
mit a sentence initial negation standing by itself, and arren adjuncts admit
postverbal negation. Negation in finite sentences is always adjacent to the
verb; there are two word order patterns: some complementizers (declarative
-ela and bait-) require that the [negation + finite (auxiliary) verb + comple-
mentizer] complex appear moved to the left of the main verb (as in matrix
clauses), while others require that the complex remain right after the main
verb (in sentence-final position); some complementizers accept both possi-
bilities. Generally speaking, it seems that the less semantic content a com-
plementizer has, the more likely it is for it to accept the left-movement pat-
tern, although this cannot be taken as a strict rule.",[792]
"Given that ablative nominalized clauses occur mainly with movement verbs,
one might want to consider them true complements (see 4.10.2.1.2 above).
4.10.2.2.1.2. -t(z)eko adjuncts and related formsThe verbal noun can take the suffix -ko to form purposive non-finite struc-
tures:(1767) Zuek hemen sartzeko,              lehenago     guk        irten
       you   here   enter, tzeko         before       we.ERG     leave

         do     must.FUT    AUX
        'In order for you to get in, first we will have to get out.'",[769]
"Nevertheless, dyadic auxiliary verbs both of the ergative/absolutive or abso-
lutive/dative type often instantiate arguments of the nominal predicate, as in
(700). Constructions bearing true arguments contrast with allocutives in
(699) because they lack person restrictions:(700) a. Zapata horiek handiak ditu                       haurrak.
           shoe     those big.DET AUX.3A.PL/3E child.ERG
         'Those shoes are too big for the child.' (lit.'he has them big')
      b. Dirua beharrezkoa du                   Jonek        proiektua
           money necessary        AUX.3A/3E Jon.ERG project

         'Jon needs money in order to carry out the project.' (lit.'Jon has
         money necessary...')
      c. Dirua beharrezkoa zaio                 Joni         proiektua

          forward carry.out.to
         'Jon needs money in order to carry out the project.' (lit.'Money is
         necessary to him in order to...')Different kinds of (auxiliary) verbs appear with participles depending on the
number of arguments, as in the following example. Note that with the auxil-
iary edun 'have' in (701b), two different readings are obtained: a predicative
reading and an active perfective one:
                                                              Nominal Predication 431

           Ί have said this to Miren a thousand times.'","[460, 461]"
"
2.3.2.2. Restrictions on the assignment of main prosodic prominenceAs in all dialects of Basque, in Tolosa only a word contained in the syntactic
phrase immediately preceding the verb may receive main prosodic promi-
nence. In sentences such as (52), with three syntactic phrases before the verb
(i.e., the subject amonak 'grandma', the indirect object αηάίαί 'to [my]
brother', and the direct object ogi-mamia 'bread-crumb'), it is the word in
the phrase that is left-adjacent to the verb that is most prominent intonation-
ally. This is the direct object ogi-mamiya. It would not be acceptable to pro-
vide main intonational prominence to any word in any phrase other than the
direct object:(52) Amonak         anäiai     ogi-mamiya eman dio.
     grandma.ERG brother.DAT bread-crumb give AUX
     'Grandma has given a bread-crumb to (my, her, our) brother.' /
     'It has been a bread-crumb that grandma has given to (my, her, our)
     brother.'",[133]
"
4.4.6.3.1.2. Multiple clausemate wh-wordsAs for wh-words, we have already mentioned in the introduction to this
chapter that, very occasionally, several wh-words may coexist preverbally
in the same clause:(971) Eta      zure    prestutasunaz       ... nork          zer      erranen     du?
         and   your    virtue.on              who.ERG        what     say.FUT     AUX
        'And about your virtue, who will say what?' [Ax. 2]In such cases, as with multiple foci, the wh-words involved must occur in
the neutral order, so that the sequence zer nork in the previous sentence
would not be acceptable. Moreover, no other non-interrogative element may
intervene between the wh-words:(972)    *Nork         horretazJberazlJoni             zer         erranen   dio?
          who.ERG      that.on/therefore/Jon.DAT       what        say.FUT AUX
        'Who will say what to Jon/therefore/on that?'",[529]
"In this case there is a subtle difference in intonation that forces the subjunc-
tive complement in (1101b) to be uttered as a dislocated phrase, represented
here by a comma at the end of the complement. In fact, the subjunctive
complement is not easily sandwiched in a matrix negative structure with
that order, as shown in (1102):(1102) a. Ez         nion   [gehiago etor      ez   zedin]    agindu.
               not AUX more           come not AUX       ordered
               Ί didn't ordered him/her not to come anymore.'
        b. ΊΕζ nion         [ez zedin   gehiago     etor]    agindu.
               not   AUX    not   AUX   more        come     orderedThe position of the dependent clause in (1102) corresponds to de Rijk's
(1996b) 'quasi-focus' position (see 4.4.7.2.1). The subjunctive complement,
with preposed negation+auxiliary, can precede the matrix negative, as a
topic:(1103) Ez zedin gehiago etor, ez nion agindu.
                                                                     Negation   527
4.5.2.1.2.5. Adverbial clausesThe same alternative patterns of preposed and postposed negation plus aux-
iliary are found in temporal and causal adverbial clauses, and in condition-
als. Let us first consider temporals:(1104) a. Akzioek             gora    egiten      ez   dutenean,
             shares.ERG       up      do.IMPF not      AUX.COMP.DET.LOC
             saltzen        hasiko       gara.
             sell.IMPF      begin.FUT    AUX
            'When the shares do not go up, we will begin to sell.'
         b. Akzioek      ez dutenean                 gora
             shares.ERG       not    AUX.COMP.DET.LOC      up
             egiten,  saldu behar da.
             do.iMPF sell     must AUX
            'When the shares do not go up, one must sell.'","[556, 557]"
"   On the other hand, as we said above in section 2.3.1.1, only an unac-
cented word immediately preceding the verb displays prominence on its fi-
nal syllable. A lexically unaccented word that is not left-adjacent to the verb
cannot have prominence, regardless of whether it is contained in the phrase
preceding the verb or not. Thus, a sentence such as (18), pronounced with an
accent in the first word, is ungrammatical. The word gixonak is the subject,
and is therefore in a separate syntactic phrase from the preverbal word, the
object biarra. Its correct version would be one of the sentences in (19):(18) * Gixonak biarra topa dau.
      man.ERG job      find     AUX
       ""The man has found a job.'(19) a. Gixonak biarrd topa dau.
     b. Biarra gixonak topa dau / gixonäk topa dau biarra.",[114]
"Leaving aside the issue of the semantics of debekatu (Goenaga suggests that
it might mean not only 'forbid' but 'transmit a prohibition to somebody';
similar considerations apply to proposatu), it looks like, despite the phe-
nomenon of control, nominalized clauses headed by -t(z)e + a do accept
lexical subjects, especially emphatic pronouns.
   Command/order verbs that select -t(z)eko complements usually have an
empty subject controlled by the dative, but this is not a must, at least with
esan:(1658) a. Aitak         Amaiarii     [EY hona
           father.ERG Amaia.DAT           here.to
           etortzeko]    esan dio.
           come.tzeko tell AUX
          'Father told Amaia (Amaia)/someone else to come here.'
       b. Aitak Amaiarii [gUj hona etortzeko] esan dio.
                             we
          'Father told Amaia that we should come here.'",[734]
"
4.10.3.1.1.4. Left- and right-branchingIn the examples above, the relative clauses precede the head. Indeed, the
prenominal position of relatives is the unmarked position in Basque, almost
obligatory for many speakers in present-day Basque. This is reminiscent of
what happens with genitive phrases, and the complementizer employed in
relatives (-(e)n) has often been considered to be cognate with the genitive
marker (-en), though this remains doubtful, because, unlike the genitive, the
complementizer doesn't seem to be syllabic in its underlying form (-«).
    In the past, another word order could be used, and can still be used as a
marked form in modern eastern dialects. In this case the relative clause is
still embedded, but, like an adjective, it follows the head. See (1851):
766   Syntax
(1851)    [Eskualdun zahar [zerbait    dakite-n]         -ak]    aide
          Basque       old   something k n o w - c O M P -DET.PL side
          dituzte.
          have
         'The old Basques who know something have them on their side.'
         [Etch. Bur.-ΛΠ] In (1851) the head is eskualdun 'Basque', and the relative clause follows it
 (after the adjective zahar 'old').
    Observe that in (1851) the relative clause precedes the determiner (-ak),
 which must be at the end of the whole NP. Thus, there is no extraposition of
the relative clause. Actually the relative clause occupies the position that ad-
jectives have in Basque, i.e. to the right of the head-noun, but before the de-
terminer. Thus we have a case of right-branching with regard to the lexical
head of the phrase (the bare noun), but not with regard to its functional head
(the determiner). Hence, the relative clause in (1851) is not the last syntactic
constituent within the whole NP because it is followed by the determiner,
which is actually suffixed to it (-ak).
    One should not analyze (1851) as a relative clause having an internal
head. If this were the case, the head (euskalduri) would have the ergative
case-marker which corresponds to it within the relative. Basque doesn't al-
low this relativization strategy.
    Postnominal embedded relatives share all the properties prenominal rela-
tives have, and they must not be considered on a par with the extraposed
relatives studied below.","[795, 796]"
"The same neutral order is also found in de Rijk's examples (1978:103-104)
showing that multiple foci are possible. It is possible to find preverbal foci
cooccurring with focalized constituents in the postverbal domain, provided
a 'correcting' interpretation is assigned to the foci. Such a correction can be
directed to a previously made statement or can be raised against the presup-
posed situation:(969) Liburua       MIRENEK       ekarri      dit      goizean            NEURI.
