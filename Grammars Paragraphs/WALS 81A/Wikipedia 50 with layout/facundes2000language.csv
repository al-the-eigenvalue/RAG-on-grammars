8.10.1 Clauses with Co-Occurring NP-Subject and NP-Object       If we only consider clauses in which subject and object co-occur as NPs, we candescribe Apurinã as a language that has semi-free constituent order variation. This isso because, of the six logically possible constituent order types in a language,
i.e.   SOV             SVO             VOS
       OSV             OVS             VSO
five types can be attested in the elicitation of Apurinã sentences,
i.e.   SOV             SVO             VOS
       OSV             OVS             *VSO
and at least four of them are attested in Apurinã texts:
i.e.   SOV             SVO             *VOS
       OSV             OVS             *VSO
       The next examples are illustrative of each type. The example in (126) shows thesubject preceding the object when both subject and object are pre-verbal (i.e. SOV):
                                                546

8.10.          Clausal Constituent Order Variation inSimplex Sentences        The (morpho)syntactic properties considered in the next subsections correspond,respectively, to the distribution of the NP-subject and the NP-object in the clause, and tothe patterns of bound pronominal markers in the verb as they correlate with thedistribution of NP-subject and NP-object in simplex sentences. The information providedbelow on constituent order variation has already been made partly explicit in variousparts of this and the previous chapters, and will be systematically presented now. Theanalysis presented below is restricted to NP-subjects and NP-objects, the distribution ofclausal constituents bearing oblique grammatical relations is not included here. As wasshown in the previous chapter, in section 7.5, NPobls can occur almost anywhere in the                                                 545
clause, except that they depend in part on the individual properties of each of the varioustypes of oblique constituents. These individual properties require further investigationbefore a detailed analysis of oblique constituents can be presented, and they will not bediscussed in this work.","[576, 577]"

       The fact that clauses where one NP-subject/object occurs and clauses where bothNP-subject and NP-object co-occur constitute only 60% of the total number of clausesattested in the language (i.e., in my text database; cf. numbers in Table 3) requires that arather large corpus of texts be used in analyzing discourse-pragmatic factors involved inconstituent order variation. Nevertheless, the fact that no clear-cut relationship can beattested between discourse-pragmatic factors and the type of constituents order used byitself suggests the unlikelyhood that a single constituent order type can be convincinglyassociated to a single (unmarked/neutral) discourse-pragmatic factor.","[589, 590]"

8.3.1 Core Grammatical Relations       Core grammatical relations have been defined above both in terms of generallytaking the form of a NP to express arguments of a verb, as well as in terms of expressingarguments that are required by the lexical meaning of the verb. The latter part of thedefinition can be considered of greater importance, since, as will be seen later (8.3.1.2,8.3.2.4 and 8.3.2.5), there are two subclasses of oblique grammatical relations that can beencoded as NPs. There are two types of core grammatical relations that can bedistinguished on the basis of a cluster of properties associated with one but not the otherNPs expressing argument functions. These are referred to by the traditional labels(grammatical) subject and (grammatical) object. As will be seen later, in section 8.9,the distribution of clausal constituents in a sentence cannot be used as a defining criterionfor subject- and objecthood, since the position of such clausal constituents may vary inways that cannot be predicted on the basis of specific grammatical factors. That is, thereis enough variation in the order of clausal constituents so as to make it impossible to tellwhether a NP bears subject or object grammatical relation to the verb purely on the basisof its position in a sentence. The data on clausal constituent order variation will besystematically described in 8.9.","[501, 502]"
"Since the presence of AUX is also structurally optional, it has been omitted here. Alsoomitted was the oblique argument of potentially ditransitive, described in 5.1.1.2..2. Table 2                                                  554
summarizes the information on the bound pronominal markers and on the optionalityproperty of post-verbal subject/object NPs:

The total number of clauses in the 8 texts is 744 units. No significant differencein text genera has been attested, which, thus, justifies lumping them together here. Thatis, when the texts are considered individually, no contradictory numbers appear. Lexicaland pronominal subject/object are not distinguished in the counts presented below. Ihave ignored such a distinction for the purpose of this paper because the dominantdistribution of lexical subject and lexical object is not different from the dominantdistribution of pronominal subject and object respectively. Furthermore, in analyzingconstituent order types, I only considered clauses with verbal predicates. As a result, outof 745 clauses, 244 non-verbal or objective descriptive predicates were excluded from thecount, thus leaving 501 clauses with verbal predicates. Both non-verbal and objectdescriptive predicates differ from other non-descriptive verbal predicates in theirpronominal marking patterns and, as such, require a separate description. Furtherinvestigation is required on the constituent order variation involving non-verbal andobjective descriptive predicates.","[585, 586]"
"
8.10.2 Pre- versus Post-Verbal Subject/Object-NPs            In any order type in which there is a post-verbal NP functioning as subject orobject, there has to be also a bound pronominal marker attached to the verb that iscoreferential with the post-verbal subject or object. In contrast, in any order type inwhich the NP-subject/object is pre-verbal, no bound pronominal marker that cross-references the NP-subject/object can be found on the verb.23 Examples such as those23
     It is true, however, in my database (as it was in Aberdour’s 1985) that some rather marginal exceptions can be
     attested in text material.",[579]
"        Finally, the distribution of subject and object NPs in simplex sentences cannot bepredicted on grammatical grounds. Further research is necessary in order to establishwhether/which specific discourse-pragmatic factors play any significant role in the“decision” of Apurinã speakers to use one or another of the clausal constituent ordersfound in the language. Nevertheless, it would appear that none of the clausal constituentorder types in the language can be argued to be more basic/neutral/unmarked than theother in any way other than in terms of rather theory-specific assumptions or principles,as will be shown in the next section.",[576]
"            In the examples in (126-131), I have ignored the presence of the boundpronominal forms attached to the verbs. These forms and their relation to constituentorder variation will be discussed in the following subsections. What I wish to underscorehere is the fact that except for VSO, all clausal constituent order patterns are acceptablein the language. Furthermore, of the five order types attested in the elicitation oftransitive clauses, only the orders VOS and VSO are not attested in text material. I mustalso notice that although VOS and VSO are not found in text material, VO and VS are.",[579]
"       The language has characteristics of a head-marking type language in having, forinstance, cross-referencing markings on verbs and possession markers on the headpossessed noun. The rich morphology of this language does not at all imply the lack ofsyntactic operations; instead, it simply means that many grammatical functions areformally encoded in the morphosyntax, i.e. they are expressed by forms that partiallyobey morphological rules as to their distribution, but syntactic conventions as to their useand allocation in the clause. As to clausal constituent order, the language is
                                                52
predominantly OV in terms of its word order corelations, although the most frequentorder in text is VO. The language also has a gender system based on thefeminine-masculine grammatical distinction, a morphologically marked noun classsystem based on alienable versus inalienable possession, and an incipient nounclassification system consisting of nouns with classificatory functions that recur as part ofa productive noun compounding system.","[83, 84]"

        The fact that I was not able to reproduce with various speakers the same behaviorin which OSV is interpreted as the default constituent order suggests that OSV cannot beconsidered as an order type that is syntactically structured. That is, there is no generalsyntactic template such as OSV in Apurinã that can override semantic or pragmaticinformation. As a consequence, it would appear that the various types of constituentorder patterns are more likely to be motivated by discourse-pragmatic factors. If thatwere the case, it would be natural for speakers to vary when evaluating clauses withcertain ambiguities as to ‘who did what.’
8.10.5 Frequency Distribution of Constituent Order Types        On the basis of the data provided above, we can conclude that there are 5 transitiveand 2 intransitive general clausal constituent order types in Apurinã, as listed in Table 2.",[585]

            AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF       Sidney da S. Facundes     for the degree of     Doctor of Philosophy       in the Department of Linguistics to be taken January 2000               Title: THE LANGUAGE OF THE APURINÃ PEOPLE OF BRAZIL       (MAIPURE/ARAWAK)       A somewhat typologically informed grammatical description of the Apurinãlanguage is provided, including historical, socio-cultural, demographic and geographicinformation about the Apurinã society. The Apurinã communities spread alongtributaries of the Purus River, in western Brazilian Amazon. The grammatical analysisconsists of the phonology, morphology and syntax, with appendixes on languagevariation and the design of the Apurinã ortography, a text sample, a vocabulary list, and apreliminary reconstruction of Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari. The grammatical analysis isbased on language internal factors, though with some typological observations on majoraspects. The segmental phonology is simple; morphophonemic alternations are restrictedto pronominal subject/possessor markers and a few other bound morphemes. Stress ispredictably penultimate, though with exceptions that need further investigation.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"

8.1.2 Verb and the Object NP       Now that the structure of NP(obl)s have been motivated and their structuredescribed, it is worth inquiring whether there is any way that the verb plus the object NPconstitute a separate phrasal constituent, different from NP(obl)s. At the present time thereis no convincing positive evidence to argue that a verb plus the object NP form a phrasalunit similar to, for example, the verb phrase (hereafter VP) in English or in otherlanguages where such a constituent can be motivated. The closest thing we can find to areplacement test would consist of the replacement of the verb plus the NP objectconstruction by the verbal form txa described under 5.11.4. So, in (37a) suto ‘woman’ isa NP subject of the clause, and nhika-ru nhipoko-ru1 ‘ate food’ is the predication aboutthe subject. In (37b) we see that the whole predication about the subject can be replacedwith the form txa-ru ‘do-3M.O’:
 37a. suto   [nhika-ru [nhipoko-ru]NP ]?
      woman eat-3M.O food-UNPOSS
     ‘The woman ate food.’   b. o-[txa-ru]
      3F-do-3M.O
      ‘She did it.’
The use of txa-ru to replace an intransitive verb or a transitive verb plus its NP object iscommon in the language. This particular use of txa-ru may be what led Aberdour(1985:46) to label txa a “summary verb”, since in a way it sort of “summarizes” themeaning of a predication previously expressed in the discourse. To the extent that txa is                                                 462
used anaphorically to express the meaning of a previous predicate, it could be argued toserve as evidence, on the basis of the replacement test, for treating the verb plus NPobject construction as a VP. In the next example in (38), however, we see that the NPexpressing the notional object nhipokoru, that seemed to be internal to the predication in(37a), occurs clause initially, without the addition of any phonological pause:
 38. [nhipoko-ru]NP suto   nhika
     food-UNPOSS woman eat
     ‘The woman ate food.’
The fact that the verb and the NP object can be separated by the NP subject needs to beexplained in order to maintain a VP analysis. It is possible that the clause initial NPobject illustrated in (38) is restricted to clauses that are somehow marked (structurallyand/or pragmatically) and derivable from clausal structures such as that represented by(37a). However, such a markedness would still need to be established in the language.","[493, 494]"
"Although a preliminary analysis of prosodic structures is suggested, more work isrequired in this area. The morphology is complex and includes special bound formswhich are partially distinguishable from typical affixes. Nouns and verbs are clearly
                                               xxvii
distinct syntactic categories; however, property-referring words are describable as asubclass of intransitive verbs. Classificatory nouns are used as part of productive nouncompounding and a subset of them can be verb-incorporated and refer back to physicaland shape properties of participants previously mentioned in the discourse —in this wayresembling verb incorporated classifiers of North American languages. The descriptionof the syntactic organization of the language involves, to a great extent, examining thefunctions and behavior of bound morphemes, and reaches its highest complexity in thesystem of relative clauses. A subset of property-referring words, called objectivedescriptive verbs, presents a morphologically marked split intransitivity system which ispartly based on the semantic class of these verbs. Such a system is typical of Arawaklanguages. The constituent order is semi-free; the VO order is the most frequent in texts,but the patterns of word order correlations point to OV. Overal, the Apurinã languageconstitutes a laboratory for examining the interplay between morphological forms andsyntactic structure and functions, providing certain grammatical and semantic categoriesand structures that resemble only in part those attested in other languages.

"8.8.2.2.2      Questioning Time       In order to question time the TEMPORAL bound form -sawaku is added as partof ke-pa subject/object interrogative word form, following the gender marker -ru, as thefollowing example illustrates:
 116a. ke-ru-sawaku-pa       p-oka-pe-ru  ãkiti?
       WH-3M-TEMP-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
       ‘When have you killed the jaguar?’
8.8.2.2.3      Questioning Reason       In questioning reasons it is the noun form nere ‘will, volition’ that is added as partof the subject/object interrogative word form, as the following examples illustrate:
 117a. ke-nere-pa    kariwa        i-txa-pẽ-ka-wa?
       WH-will-INT white.person be-PFTV-PASS-REFL

       WH-will-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
       ‘Why have you killed the jaguar?’
8.8.2.2.4      Questioning Place       In order to question places the interrogative word form nhã-pa (or yã-pa,depending on speech variety) is used. The place interrogative word can occur by itself                                                539
introducing an interrogative sentence questioning a place, as illustrated in (118a), or itcan have a pronominal bound form or the GOAL postpositional marker added into theinterrogative word form, as the examples in (118b-c), respectively, illustrate:
 118a. nhã-pa        p-oka-pe-ru        ãkiti?
       PLACE-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
       ‘Where did you kill the jaguar?’    b. nhã-õ-pa         o-su-pe-ru?

       PLACE-GOAL-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
       ‘Where have you killed the jaguar?’
       There is also an unrelated form that is used to question places, namely atapa-ru(or ĩtepa-ru, depending on the speech variety). This second interrogative word form forplaces does not allow the addition of other forms into it and is generally used in sentenceswith nominal predicates, such as the one illustrated in the next example:
 119. ata-pa-ru         ãkiti?
      PLACE-INT-3M jaguar
      ‘Where is the jaguar?’
8.8.2.2.5      Questioning Manner       In order to question manner, the manner interrogative word kanhi-pa is used. Themanner interrogative word does not allow the addition of other forms into it. Thefollowing examples are instances of kanhi-pa being used to introduce interrogativesentences questioning manner:
                                                540

          For interrogative sentences questioning manner there is also an unrelated formthat can be used, in addition to kanhi-pa, namely natoko-pa, as the following exampledemonstrates. This second manner interrogative word also does not allow the addition ofother forms into it.
 121. natoko-pa        p-oka-pe-ru             ãkiti?

      ‘In which way have you killed the jaguar?’8.8.2.3      Indirect Content Questions          Indirect questions (or dependent interrogatives or embedded-WH questions,(Sadock and Zwicky 1985:186 and Givón 1990:2.804-806) consist of interrogativeclauses whose verbs take an information question as complement. Examples of suchverbs may include ‘ask’, ‘know’, and ‘announce’. Different from languages like Englishand Portuguese, however, Apurinã does not make use of interrogative words in indirectquestion. Instead, indirect questions use the same formal device of relative clauses(described in detail in the next chapter, subsection 9.1.1), as illustrated in (122).
 122a. nota umaru-ta-ru       u-kama-kutu
       1SG know-VBLZ-3M.O 3M-make-REL

8.8.3 Imperative Speech Acts       Imperative speech acts consists of “syntactic forms that explicitly convey somesubset of requests/commands/orders/suggestions/instructions/entreaties, and so on”(Sadock and Zwicky 1985:170). Pickering (1971:28) lists various forms as markingsubsets of “imperative verbs”. However, commands, requests and instructions take nospecial markers in the spontaneous discourse of any the speech varieties I have observed.","[570, 571, 572, 573]"
Further information on the behavior of the object in question is required in order todemonstrate the viability of such a hypothesis.,[633]
       A necessary initial step in the description of the structure of words is to establish(preliminarily) the classes of words found in the language. Some introductory notes on themajor classes of words found in the language are in order and are presented next.,[164]
"The fact that this bound morpheme has been only found in elicited speech may suggestthat it is being left out of the language in more contemporaneous speech varieties. -pokawas described by Pickering as marking a “polite command”. The way they are used nowis more as commands, as the following examples illustrate:
 123a. ĩporãã p-apa-poka     watxa
       water 2SG-fetch-IMPER now
      ‘Go get water now.’    b. p-umaka-poka
       2SG-sleep-IMPER
       ‘Go sleep.’
       Other than examples such as these above, commands, orders etc. take noadditional marking forms. Instead, they lack a subject expressed by an independent NP;their subject is expressed solely by the bound pronominal form for the second personsingular subject. In the following examples in (124), the sentences can be uttered ascommand in (124a), a request in (124b) (repeated from (74)), and a warning in (124c):
                                               542
 124a. xamuna pu-taka xãã-poki-ã
      firewood 2SG-put flame-border-INSTR
      ‘Put firewood in the fire.’    b. ĩporãã pu-suka-no
       water 2SG-give-1SG.O
       ‘Bring me water.’    c. tsora! pu-muteka!
       Tsora 2SG-run
       ‘Tsora! Run!’
8.8.3.1      Hortative Speech Act          Hortative sentences can be considered the subtype of imperative speech actwhere “the speaker is encouraging or inciting someone to action” (Bybee et al 1994:179),thus different from commands, orders, instructions and the like. Hortative sentences aremarked with the clause-initial (h)amo ‘HORTATIVE’ particle already mentioned inchapter 6. (h)amo is found in clauses about inviting someone to go somewhere, dosomething (e.g. eat, dance, etc.) and so on. Aside from occurring only clause initially,another restriction of this hortative marker is that it can only be used with first personplural, as the following examples illustrate:
 125a. hamo a-su-pe
      HORT 1PL-go-PFTV
      ‘Let’ get going.’    b. hamo a-nhipoko-ta
       HORT 1PL-eat-VBLZ
       ‘Let’s eat.’
                                                 543
    c. hamo a-serena
       HORT 1PL-dance
       ‘Let’s eat.’       HORT [s-V-o              O ]
    d. hamo [a-kama-ro         ããta ]
       HORT 1Pl-make-3M.O canoe
       ‘Let’s build a canoe”.’8.9. Summary: Evidence for Subject-ObjectDistinctions       The notions of grammatical subject and grammatical object can be motivated onthe basis of various ways that the syntactic expressions of notional subject and notionalobject behave in the clause, as summarized in Table 1. The distinct marking orbehavioral properties that the syntactic expressions of subject and object have in the sameset of clauses characterize a syntactic distinction between the two.","[573, 574, 575]"
"9.1.1.1.2       The Role of the HeadREL in the Relative Clause        The first opposition encoded by the relative markers that is illustrated below isthat concerning their role in the clause while encoding core grammatical relations, i.e.subject and objects. The sentences in (6) illustrate two independent clauses. The subjectof the first and second clauses are both suto ‘woman’, and (in the context used here) theyare coreferential. In order to relativize the subject of the first clause, i.e. suto, makingthis subject a headREL, the coreferential relative pronominal marker -karo is added to the
                                                  565
verb of the first clause. The resulting complex sentence (containing a relative clause) in(7) (already given above in (2) is formed when the two sentences in (6) are combined:
     O     S       V
6a. kuku suto     karota
     man woman hurt
    ‘The woman hurt the man.’     S      V
 b. suto   apo-pe
    woman arrive-PFTV
    ‘The woman arrived.’
    S/S    [O    V-rel.s ]ClREL        V
7. suto   kuku karota-karo           apo-pe
   woman man hurt-REL.F.POS.S arrive-PFTV
   ‘The woman who hurt the man arrived.’
That is, as a result of adding -karo to the verb of the sentence in (6a), this sentence is“nominalized”, becoming a relative clause embedded as the subject of the matrix clause.","[596, 597]"
"
8.10.4 Constituent Order Resolution in Potentially Ambiguous Sentences       In Facundes 1994 I described clauses with no bound pronominal markers attachedto the verb. In principle, unless semantics or discourse-pragmatics made it clear who thesubject or object was, such clauses would be ambiguous as to their interpretation of whodid what to whom. In clauses such as the following in (145), semantics and/or discourse-pragmatics would suffice to provide the correct interpretation of the clause. This is truesince ‘I ate the food’ expresses a trivial and natural event. ‘The food ate me,’ on theother hand, would require a conception rather distinct from the way the event of ‘eating’is normally conceived in the Apurinã world of natural events —which, of course, couldbe licensed by the specific context of mythological stories but less likely in the context ofeveryday language.",[583]

       The next table shows the number for pre- versus post-verbal subject. Table 5shows an unequivocal tendency for subjects to occur pre-verbally rather than post-verbally:

The higher frequency of post-verbal over pre-verbalobject, however, is not as more frequent as the higher frequency of pre-verbal over post-verbal subject.","[587, 588]"
"
                                                                 607
complements marked with -inhi in the previous subsection. In both of the examples in(52a) and (52b) the complex sentence has a complement clause with an intransitive verb,and a matrix clause with a complement-taking verb that is marked with the objectpronominal marker -ru. The presence of -ru indicates that its complement is functioningas object of the matrix verb, in which case V-inhi would have a nominal (not verbal)distribution. That is, in order for the V-inhi to function as the object argument of thematrix verb it must be nominalized. This nominal distribution as evidence for thenominal status of V-inhi is, however, a weak one, since (as seen under 9.1.2.1) even a fullsentence can also function as the object of a matrix verb, for example, for utterance verbs.","[638, 639]"
"8.8.2.2.1        Questioning subject and object          The form used to question the subject or object of a verb is ke-pa (or ki-pa,depending on speech variety). As described in chapter 6, interrogative words in Apurinãcan be compared with interrogative words in other languages. ke- and -pa can becompared with the WH initial in English or the QU initial in Romances languages such asPortuguese. The difference is that ke- and -pa are more clearly segmentable asmorphemes in Apurinã, whereas the others are synchronically more opaque forms, andalso that ke- and -pa are two recurring forms in interrogative words, whereas there is only
                                                  537
one recurring form in English and Portuguese. The following examples are illustrative ofinterrogative words questioning subject/object:
 113a. ke-pa    oka-pe-ru           uwa-nhi?
       WH-INT kill-PFTV-3M.O 3SG.M-AFFECT
       ‘Who/what has killed kill him/it?’    b. ke-pa    p-oka-pe?
       WH-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV
       ‘What/who have you killed?’
       As the following examples show, when nouns such as suto ‘man’ and xenhi‘meat’ occur as part of the interrogative word, the argument being questioned is morespecific, being semantically modified by the interrogative word:
 114a. ke-suto-pa       kariwa        txa-wa?
       WH-woman-INT white.person be-REFL
       ‘Which woman is a white person?’    b. ke-xenhi-pa     hare-ka?
       WH-meat-INT be.good-PRED
       ‘Which meat is good?’
       The interrogative forms in which a noun occurs as part of interrogative wordshave been clearly attested in some speech varieties, and were also reported in Pickering1977b. However, at least one speaker from the Paciá village reported that he himselfwould rather use forms such as the following, where nhi- is added to mark subject/objectas a specific one:
 115a. nhi-ke-ro-pa       kariwa        txa-wa?
       SPEC-WH-3F-INT white.person be-REFL
       ‘Which woman is a white person?’
                                               538
    b. nhi-ke-ru-pa          ãkiti  oka-pe?
       SPEC-WH-3M-INT jaguar kill-PFTV
       ‘Which jaguar has killed him/it?’
Further research is necessary in order to determine the extent to which this second type ofquestion marking is common in other speech varieties.","[568, 569, 570]"
"                                                                472
encoded crosslinguistically. These generalized semantic notions will simplify thepresentation of the dissociation between core grammatical relations and semantic rolesbut will NOT affect the final results of the analysis in the ways that are relevant formotivating subject and object in Apurinã. The generalized “agent”-like semantic rolewill be called actor, whereas the “patient”-like semantic role will be called undergoer(idem). The example in (47) aims to illustrate that subject can be dissociated from itsmost typical semantic correlate, i.e. actor. So, in the following example uwa-nhi‘3SG.M-AFFECT’ is an undergoer subject: 7
     S                 V
47. uwa-nhi             iri-pe
   3SG.M-AFFECT fall-PFTV
   ‘He/it has fallen down.’
The next example shows that subject can also be dissociated from its most typicalpragmatic role, i.e. topic from previous discourse. The following example could be ananswer to the question “Who shot it?”, where the subject refers to a newly introducedparticipant in the discourse:8
7
    The apparent assumption held here is that there is a strong correlation between subject and actor/cataphoric topic, and
     of object with undergoer. Rather than an assumption, however, such correlations are well documented in the works
     of Givón (e.g. 1995 ch. 3, 1992, 1990 ch. 20, 1988, 1983) and others.

    The two examples above illustrate the type of test that needs to be done in order to show that grammatical relations
     are distinct from semantic or pragmatic relations. Although, in principle, one should perform such tests for each type
     of evidence presented for grammatical relations, in fact, this is not done here. Instead, in the following subsections I
     only perform the test with respect to the most typical semantic role associated with the relevant grammatical relation,
     making only textual mentions of the dissociation between a specific grammatical relation and its pragmatic role.
     This can only be done here because the evidence in the language against treating subject/object as performing purely
     pragmatic roles is so overwhelming that it would be redundant to repeat it for each time a property of a grammatical
     relation is presented.","[503, 504]"

"5.1.1.2.1      Regular Transitive Verbs       Regular transitive verbs are the most typical transitive verbs in the language,insofar as they require both a (grammatical) subject and a (grammatical) object, wherein                                                285
subject and object can be expressed as noun phrases, as a combination of noun phrasesplus the corresponding subject/object pronominal marker in the verb, or just as subjectand object pronominal markers. Regular transitive verbs constitute by far the greatmajority of transitive verbs found in the language. In the following examples in (16)(where underlining marks co-reference between the relevant arguments), the(pro)nominal forms aõtu ‘umari fruit’, uwa ‘3SG.M’, maku ‘Brazil-nut’, and komeru-pe‘manioc-pulp’ are all grammatical objects in the clauses they occur in; in (16d) thesubject is formally expressed as the pronominal marker a- ‘1PL’; and in (16e) bothsubject and object are only manifested, respectively, as the pronominal markers a- and-ru:
 16a. hãtako-ro apa-nanu-ta-ru               aõtu
      girl.F       fetch-PROG-VBLZ-3M.O umari(M)

      ‘We take the manioc pulp out.’   e. a-makatxaka-ru
      1PL-take.out-3M.O
      ‘We take it out.’
In the examples in (16) subject/object pronominal markers are only found in the verbwhen the subject/object NP is either post-verbal or absent in the clause. I will discuss in                                                286

"       As seen in chapter 2, the segmental phonology of the language is organized inrelatively simple terms. The language has a (C)(V)V syllable template and itsmorphophonological alternations are restricted to the subject/possessor markers and a fewother bound morphemes. Stress is mostly predictably penultimate, although sensitive tosyllable weight —as determined by nasality and lengthening. Further research needs tobe done in order to explain the exceptions to the general patterns described in chapter 2,especially with respect to the possibility of the same word form to vary in its primarystress position. Only a tentative analysis was presented on intonation in Apurinã; moreresearch is necessary in the prosodic structure of the language.",[644]
"Conversely, only the gerund marker, the “passive” marker, and the object markers cannotbe part of a typical noun base. Although a more complete survey is necessary in order todetermine exactly which closed word classes can take any of the special boundformatives, the preliminary evidence presented above suggests that all special boundformatives that attach to a noun base also attach to one or more of the closed wordclasses. For the purpose of describing the general distributional properties of specialbound formatives, these formatives can be presented in terms of whether they occur withverb bases, with noun bases, with closed class word bases, or with a combination of thesebases.

         Language Variation and the Design of the                             Apurinã OrthographyLanguage Variation and the Phonological System         If we consider the large geographic scattering of the Apurinã speech communities, it is notsurprising to find that there are different speech varieties that make up the Apurinã language. Suchlanguage internal diversity is a major feature of the language that cannot be ignored in the study of thelanguage grammatical system. In order to investigate the several speech varieties and verify in whichaspects they diverge or converge, a standardized word list was used in collecting data samples fromdifferent communities. In the analysis of language variation presented here the phonological processesfound in the speech variety of the Japiim community is compared to the speech of 11 other communities.","[647, 648]"
"Finally, I will return to some of the closed classes or words in chapters 8-9, where the syntax ofsimplex sentences is described. As happens in various other places in this work, certain wordproperties can be better described within the specific domains of the grammar that theseproperties are most relevant to. This applies most clearly to the interrogative words and to themajority of the particles introduced above. In fact, even more than syntactic structures, discourseparticles require information about the organization of the Apurinã discourse structure in order tobe properly described. Since this work does not include a description of discourse structures,discourse particles cannot (unfortunately) be satisfactorily described here.",[406]

At this stage in the description of the language no other unambiguous syntactic evidencehas be attested for distinguishing subject from object syntactically. Some of the syntactictests generally used to distinguish core grammatical relations are not conclusive, since theresults can be accounted for on semantic or discourse-pragmatic grounds rather thansyntactically. For this reason, I have defined subject and object over the coreferential                                                544
properties of NPs with the pronominal markers in the verb. However, there are certainproblems that arise from defining subject and object over such morphosyntactic markers(as will be seen in the discussion of relative clauses in the next chapter, in 9.1.1.6).","[575, 576]"
"8.5.1.1      Causatives          As seen in 5.2.1.1.1.2, 5.2.1.1.1.5 and 5.2.1.2.1.4, there are three forms ofmorphological causatives in the language. The first causativizer is the class1 boundverbal form -kũtaka, used with transitive verbs, and described in 5.2.1.1.1.5 above. -kũtaka is illustrated in clausal context in (79a), where it attaches to the transitive verb nhika‘to eat’; p-ita-ru ‘2SG-cousin.of-M’ refers to the one caused to do something (i.e. thecausee); yapa ‘“capibara”’ is what was caused to be eaten; and the subject marker a-refers to the one who causes the causee to do something (i.e. the causer). nhika is abivalent verb, but in this example it works as a trivalent one as a result of the presence ofthe causativizer: (In these and in other examples below, underlining is used just to                                                   505
highlight the causativizer, whereas double underlining indicates coreference betweendouble-underlined forms.)
             O.CAUSEE               ?      s.causer-V-CAUS
 79a. hamo p-ita-ru               yapa     a-nhika-kũtaka-ta

      HORT capybara 1PL-eat-T.CAUS-VBLZ-3M.O 3SG.M-AFFECT
     ‘Let’s make him eat “capybara”.’
       The example in (79b) illustrates the fact that, in causative constructions, thecausee can be marked in the verb as the object marker. Thus, the NP-causee bears thesubject whereas the NP-causer bears the object grammatical relations. The question leftunanswered is what the grammatical relation of ‘what is caused to be V-ed’ is. In otherwords: What is the grammatical relation of yapa in (79)? One possible analysis of thisthird argument of causative constructions is to treat it as bearing an oblique grammaticalrelation. The problem, however, of treating arguments such as yapa in (79) as an obliqueis that this argument is not structurally optional in the clause in the same way as otherobliques are in the language. Another possible analysis is to treat it as a secondary objectthat is restricted to causative constructions. The problem with this second analysis is thatthere is no independent evidence to treat such an argument as an object. The notion of agrammatical object was defined for Apurinã over the possibility of a free expression co-occur with a coreferential object marker in the verb. As was shown in (79), the objectmarker in the verb of causative constructions is coreferential with the causee and not with‘what is caused to be V-ed’. Hence, either analyses have problems. In order to avoidpositing an ill motivated solution to this problem, I will choose to leave undetermined
                                                506
what the grammatical relation of ‘what is caused to be V-ed’ is in a causativeconstruction. I suspect that further research on the intrinsic properties of objects andobliques in Apurinã will reveal ways that will help to resolve the issue.","[536, 537, 538]"

      ‘He killed you (pl).’       The same pronominal markers are used for the subject regardless of thetransitivity of the verb (as shown in chapter 5, under 5.1.1), semantic or pragmatic rolesof the subject NP. What would appear to constitute an exception are the objectivedescriptive intransitive verbs, described in the chapter 5, in 5.1.1.1.2.2. If it could beshown that these verbs have different semantic properties from standard intransitiveverbs, one could argue that pronominal subject markers are co-referential with argumentsother than the single argument of verbs with the semantics of object descriptive verbs andother than the “patient”-like argument of transitive verbs. However, as was shown in theprevious chapter (in subsection 5.1.1.1.2.2), although the class of descriptive verbs showssome semantic correlates, it cannot be reduced to a specifiable semantic class of verbsand, as such, can be more generally characterized as a grammatically (as opposed tosemantically) motivated subclass of intransitive verbs, although one that stronglycorrelates with property-referring concepts. That is, the fact that object descriptive verbs
                                                 475
take object rather than subject as their single argument cannot be motivated on purelysemantic grounds, thus constituting no exception to the claim that the pronominal subjectmarkers are co-referential with grammatical rather than semantic relations, namely withthe grammatical subject. As a consequence, subject pronominal markers are a reliablecriterion that can be used for the identification of grammatical subjects in Apurinã,although not all grammatical subjects in other languages will translate as grammaticalsubjects in Apurinã.","[505, 506, 507]"
"However, there is one basic property that will work for the purpose of describing thesyntax of verbs, namely that the grammatical subject is the syntactic expression of anargument (of a verb) that can co-occur with a coreferential subject pronominal markerattached to the verb. The grammatical object, in contrast, is the syntactic expression ofan argument (of a verb) that can co-occur with a coreferential object pronominal markerattached to the verb. The co-occurrence of the subject or the object free expression withits corresponding coreferential pronominal marker, however —as will be discussed laterin 8.2.1.2— is only possible when the subject/object free expression is post-verbal. So,in (2a) -ru is the object pronominal marker for third person masculine object which iscoreferential with the nominal form ximaku ‘fish’, thus indicating that ximaku is the
                                                272
grammatical object of the verb in that clause. In (2b) n- is the subject pronominal markerfor first person singular subject which is coreferential with the independent pronominalform nota ‘1SG’, thus indicating that nota is the grammatical subject of the verb in thatclause:
2a. ata nhika-ru ximaku
    we eat-3M.O fish
    ‘We eat fish.’ b. yowata n-atamata nota
    knife      1SG-look 1SG
    ‘I look at the knife.’
          The full sets of both subject and object markers which is given in Table 1 will bemorphologically described in chapter 7, in 7.1.1 and 7.1.12, respectively.","[303, 304]"

9.1.1.1.6      Actorless Passive Relative Clauses       An actorless passive ClREL, as the label suggests, is the type of relative clausethat obligatorily lacks an actor and wherein the subject encodes an undergoer semanticrole. Insofar as the subject of an actorless passive ClREL systematically encodes anundergoer, this ClREL resembles a passive clause. In order to illustrate this type of ClRELs,let us first take the following examples of simplex sentences in (19) and (20). In (19a-b)the first example illustrates a clause marked with the morpheme -~ka which, in some ofits uses, resembles a “passive” marker (as seen in 7.1.8), and the second example shows acommon simplex intransitive sentence. In the relevant context, the subjects of these twosentences are coreferential:
       S     V-pass
 19a. kuku ketã-ka
      man shoot-PASS
      ‘The man was shot.’       S         V
   b. uwa      upũpe
      3SG.M die
      ‘He died.’
In (20a-b) the first example is a common simplex transitive sentence, the second asimplex “passive” sentence, and the subjects of these two sentences are also coreferential:
      s-V-o               O
 20a. n-atama-ta-ru     manhiti
      1SG-see-VBLZ-3M.O deer
      ‘I saw a deer.’       S         V-pass
   b. uwa      nhikã-ka
      3SG.M eat-PASS
      ‘It was eaten.’                                                575
       In order to make each of these two pairs of simplex sentences into a complexsentence containing a relative clause, it is necessary to make use of a special form ofrelative pronominal marker, as the following examples illustrate. The complex sentencein (21a) can be construed as a combination of the simplex sentences in (19). (21a) isanalyzable as consisting of the headREL kuku that is modified by the ClREL keta-koru ‘whowas shot’, and the matrix clause verb upũpe ‘died’. In a similar fashion, the complexsentence in (21b) can be construed as a combination of the simplex sentences in (20),such that this latter complex sentence consists of the matrix clause n-atama-ta-ru ‘I sawit’, following the headREL manhiti ‘deer’ plus its modifying ClREL nhika-koru ‘that waseaten’. Furthermore, the examples in (21c-d) are given to show that actorless passiveClRELs do not admit an actor to be present in them. These two sentences areungrammatical because of the presence of the actor subjects kuku and suto in (21c) and(21d), respectively:
       S/O [V-rel.pass]ClREL       V
 21a. kuku keta-koru            upũpe
      man shoot-REL.M.PASS die
      ‘The man who was shot died.’      s-V-o                       O/O     [V-rel.pass]ClREL
   b. n-atama-ta-ru              manhiti nhika-koru
      1SG-see-VBLZ-3M.O deer              eat-REL.M.PASS
      ‘I saw the remaining of the deer.’
      Lit.: ‘I saw the deer that had been eaten.’       s-V-o                  O/O S          [V-rel.pass]ClREL
   c. *n-atama-ta-ru          kuku suto       oka-koru
       1SG-see-VBLZ-3M.O man woman kill-VBLZ-REL.M.PASS
       (I saw the man who was killed by the woman).","[605, 606, 607]"

5.1.1 Simple Verbs       A verb may consist of a basic or a derived verb form. Analogous to nouns (see4.1 and 4.5.2), a basic verb form can be a free root (i.e. a lexical form that cannot beanalyzed into smaller morphological units and that can stand by itself as a verb) or a rootplus formatives phonologically attached to it. In (4a-b) we have examples of a basic verbform. In (4a) the verb form arika ‘to set on fire’ consists of a free standing verbal root; in(4b) the same verb form takes the bound pronominal formatives as the expression of thearguments of the verb; (4c) shows that this verb form requires a nominalizer in order tobe a noun, and, thus, behaves as a form that is verbal:
                                                 274
4a. arika                                ‘to set on fire’ b. n-arika-ru                           ‘I set it on fire.’
    1SG-set.fire-3M.O c. arika-txi  n-atama                   ‘I looked at the fire.’
    fire-NMLZ 1SG-look
        A derived verb form can be made out of a noun, as in (5b), in which a noun stem,karuwa in (5a), can only behave as a verb if the bound verbalizer formative -ta (describedin 5.2.1.2.1.1) is attached to it. The formative -no (described in detail later in chapter 7,in 7.1.12) is one of a set of formatives that are restricted to verbs:
5a. karuwa                              ‘a non-Indian person’ b. karuwa-ta-no                        ‘I am/act like a non-Indian person’
    non-Indian-VBLZ-1SG.O
The reason the derived verb karuwa-ta ‘to be/act like a non-Indian person’ takes theobject formative -no to express the notional subject (i.e. the argument that is expressed assubject in English) is that karuwa-ta happens to belong to the class of verbs thatsystematically take these object pronominal markers, rather than the subject pronominalones. This property of certain verbs will be described in detail later, under 5.1.1.1.2.","[305, 306]"
"Although the morphology of descriptive verbs (i.e. property-referring verbs) is morelimited, it includes a subset of the non-descriptive verbs morphology plus two prefixpositions inherent to descriptive verb bases. The number of (mutually exclusive)formatives that can occur in each of such position classes can vary from one to seven.
                                                 270
Most position classes consist of only one formative. The set of subject/possessorpronominal markers may have seven or five members depending on how one interpretsthe homophonous forms used both in the singular and plural. Both the pronominalmarking sets (which will be described in detail in chapter 7, in 7.1.1 and 7.1.12) are givenin Table 1 below for convenience, since they will be referred to very often as importantverbal properties:

As I mentioned in the chapter 3 (under 3.6.1), the third person plural marker that occurswith verbs, i.e. u-... is in a discontinuous dependency relation with the plural marker…-na, such that both u-… and …-na will always co-occur in order to encode third personplural. Although …-na has been added to Table 1, it occupies its own position class inthe verb —as will be made clear in chapter 7, in 7.1.1.1. As it is clear from Table 1, thesepronominal markers behave as cumulative morphs (in Anderson’s [1988:154]terminology, or as multiple exponence or cumulation in Spencer’s [1991] terminology,or as portmanteau morphs1 in Bauer’s [1994:17] terminology). What all these terms

    Linguists, perhaps from different linguistic traditions, use the term “portmanteau” to refer exclusively to morphemes

     Bauer 1994:17).","[301, 302]"

"The fact is that further evidence would need to be gathered in order to motivate a VP inApurinã. Traditional tests such as conjoined constructions are not found in the language(as already noticed by Pickering 1974; see also discussion on juxtaposition in chapter 9,in 9.2) and, thus, cannot be used as a constituency test for VPs. Without the firmersupport of other evidence, the predication will NOT be treated here as contained within aVP, but rather as a V and a (structurally optional) NP object both as immediateconstituents of the clause.",[494]

9.1.1.1.4      Relative Clauses and the Polarity of the Verb       In order to illustrate the polarity agreement, we can compare the examples in (7)and (10) with the following examples in (15). The first difference to note is the additionof the privative marker ma- to the verb. As shown in 5.3.1, ma- is a negation marker thatforms descriptive verbs. When the example in (15a) is compared with (7), it becomesclear that the relative pronominal marker changes its form to agree with the negativemarker ma-. The comparison can also be made between (10) and (15b) to produce the
                                               570
same analytical result. The way the relative pronominal marker changes is by alternatingbetween the polarity markers -r and -t, where the first marks positive and the latter marksnegative polarities:

       Notice that, although polarity markers are restricted to descriptive verbs (i.e.intransitive verbs that take object rather than subject pronominal markers), subject but notobject relative pronominal markers inflect for polarity. This is unexpected, sincedescriptive verbs take object rather than subject pronominal markers.","[601, 602]"

9.1.2 Complement Subordination       Complement subordination is here defined as the process by which a complexsentence is formed of two or more clauses, wherein one functions as the subject/object ofthe other. Although complex sentences (and hence complementation) are less common inApurinã than, for example, in languages like English, two general types of complementscan be distinguished on the basis of whether they carry any formal marker ofsubordination. In other words, complements can be described in terms of how(dis)similar they are to a full sentence. Complements that carry no formal marking ofsubordination and that, thus, resemble the most complete sentences, are described underfull sentence complements. Complements that carry a formal marking of subordinationand/or that are reduced forms of full sentences are described under markedcomplements. A full sentence complement is to be understood as a complete sentencethat minimally has all the (morpho)syntactic expressions of the core arguments (i.e.subject and/or object), where such (morpho)syntactic expressions may take the form ofthe phrasal units described in chapter 8, section 8.1.1, or of the subject/object pronominalmarkers described in chapter 7, in subsections 7.1.1 and 7.1.12. The constituent structureof the clauses that realize a complete sentence was provided in 8.1.1.1, and the types ofthese clauses were described in chapter 8.4.",[628]
"       When referring to pronominal marking bound formatives as they are used withverbs, I will use the term subject pronominal markers, so as to distinguish their usewith verbs from their use (as possessors) with nouns, and, also, to distinguish them fromthe object pronominal markers (also listed in Table 1 above). The terms “subjectpronominal markers”, however, is more of a label used for mnemonic purposes, since, asI will argue later in 7.1.1.1, subject is morphologically marked as a function of the slotwhich subject pronominal markers occupy in the verb, rather than part of the function ofeach individual pronominal marker that occurs in such a slot. Before analyzing thesyntactic properties of verbs I will need to introduce preliminarily the notions ofgrammatical subject and grammatical object. The full set of properties that can motivategrammatical subject and grammatical object will be presented in chapter 9 (sections 9.1and 9.8), once all the required syntactic information has been systematically presented.",[303]
"5.1.1.1.2      Descriptive Intransitive Verbs       In semantic terms, descriptive intransitive (hereafter descriptive) verbs differfrom standard intransitive verbs insofar as the descriptive intransitives are exclusivelyproperty-referring words, while standard intransitives typically refer to events or, in a fewinstances, states. In morphological terms, descriptive verbs follow a split-S pattern(Andrews 1985:147-150) common in other Arawak languages (see Payne 1991:376),dividing into two subclasses: subjective and objective (here used as purely mnemoniclabels). That is, the notional subjects of some descriptive verbs take subjectmorphological markers, while the notional subjects of other descriptive verbs take objectmorphological markers —both subject and object markers were listed in Table 1. Eachof the two sub-classes of descriptive verbs are further described and illustrated in the nextsubsections.",[309]

3.2.2      Grammatical Word        The grammatical word is defined on the basis of morphological and syntacticprocesses that operate on specific word bases which do not necessarily match thephonological word. Various morphological categories that are restricted to one or anotherword class serve as morphological criteria for a grammatical word. A good example of thisis the plural markers (here illustrated in of one its masculine forms), as the examples in (4)show:
4a. kuku-wako-ru                                   ‘men’
    man-PL-Mb. *uwa muteka-wako-ru                             (They ran.)
    3M run-PL-Mc. nu-su-pe-ka-ko       nota watxa                 ‘I’ll get going now.’
   1SG-go-PFTV-PRED-FUT 1SG today
In (4) the plural marker -wako-ru is a morphological category specific to the word classnouns (to be properly defined under 3.4.), and, as a morphological property restricted to asubset of the parts-of-speech found in the language, serves as a morphological criterion todefine a grammatical word. Analogous to -wakoru (aside from many other forms described                                                124
in chapter 4), the verbal progressive form -nanu (aside from many other forms described inchapter 5) can also be used as an example of a morphological category that defines agrammatical word:
5a. uwa   muteka-nanu-ta                            ‘He’s running.’
    3SG.M run-PROGR-VBLZb. #kuku-nanu                                       (being a man, “manning”)
    man-PROGR
While -wako-ru was shown to be restricted to nouns, -nanu is shown in (5) to berestricted to verbs. To the extent that such morphological forms need to make referenceto grammatical words (or to different grammatical classes of words) in order for theirdistribution to be accounted for, they serve as evidence for the notion of grammaticalwords.","[155, 156]"
