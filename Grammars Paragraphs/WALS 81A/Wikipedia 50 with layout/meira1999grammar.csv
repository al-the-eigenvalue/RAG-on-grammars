"However, there is in Tiriy6 a more likely cognate for the Kari’na and Tamanaku words:péeto ‘servant, subject’ (as e.g. the inhabitants of a village, with respect to the chief).°
11.3.2. Color terms. In order to identify Tiriyé color terms, five different speakers (fourmales and one female; one from Miss4o Tiriés, in Brazil, two from Kwamalasamutu andtwo from Tepoe, in Surinam)          were consulted. With the help of the computer programPaintbrush (a simple drawing software that comes as part of the accessories folder inmost versions of Windows for PCs), 24 different colored squares, each of which occupiesthe whole screen, were prepared; these were shown to the speakers, who                   named themwith Tirty6 color words. Afterwards, the list of all terms was read to the same speakers;for each word, the speakers were asked to give names of animals,                 artifacts or naturalobjects that had the corresponding color. Table 11.2 lists the terms which had the mostconsistent uses, which are assumed to be more ‘basic’; the remaining words are in Table11.3. These results are admittedly preliminary and subject to revision.",[611]

5.4.3.1. The -se forms. This subgroup includes the Supine (or ‘Purpose-of-motion’), theHabitual        Past,        the     Remote   Past,    and   the   negative    forms.

        Synchronically, the suffix -se is not a semantically consistent morpheme; it is bestseen as part of complex morphemes           (-se ‘supine’, ‘habitual past’, -sewa ‘negative’, t- -se

"Verbs have, in addition, a rich system of tense-aspect-mood markers. Nouns, on the otherhand,    take    a number       of derivational       suffixes    that        further    elaborate   their     meanings(diminutive, augmentative, predilective, etc.).               A further class of adverbs (which includesadjectival      stems,    not differentiable    from    other adverbs)            does     not inflect,      but can     benominalized. In fact, verbs, adverbs, and postpositions can all be nominalized in differentways,    with     different semantic     results.     Nouns      can     be     verbalized,      again    with   severaldifferent affixes resulting in different semantics, but members of other classes must benominalized before they can be verbalized. In addition, there is a class of particles whichcomprises all uninflectables (including, besides more ‘grammatical’ particles, also sound-symbolic words and interjections). A cross-cutting category of interrogatives, comprisingnouns and adverbs, can also be established.

Recognizable constituents include anOV      verb phrase, a (possessor-possessed) genitive phrase, and a postpositional phrase;groups of appositional nouns can sometimes                     have phrase-like properties. In the simplesentence, the ordering of constituents is pragmatically determined, with topical elementstending to occur in initial position. Several kinds of dependent sentences occur, mostly(but not all) non-finite. Case marking depends on the sentence type: in most cases, it is(superficially) split-S, but there are also ergative and nominative sentence types. The twostrongest semantic roles are Agent and Patient, with good arguments in favor of Dative aswell;    all non-Dative        obliques      can be seen       as one broad        type    of Circumstantials       orPeripheral Participants. Grammatical relations (subject, object) are not really useful toolsfor the description of Tiriy6 syntax.","[43, 44]"

5.4.3.1.1. Supine and Habitual Past. The Supine and Habitual Past have almost exactlythe same form.*° Both are made by simply adding the suffix -se to the verb stem (takinginto account the allomorphic pattern of -se, as described above). With transitive stems, theO participant can be indicated with an O-marking prefix; a collective O is indicated withthe marker -:ne. For the Supine form, it is further possible to mark the absence of anydefinite O participant by choosing the back grade form of the stem (cf. 2.6.1                          on Tiriyéablaut);*’ it is not known whether or not this possibility exists for the Habitual Past. WithSa stems, no further prefix is necessary; with So stems, a ‘generic’ prefix i- is added toconsonant-initial stems. (114) exemplifies the forms with the transitive stem pono(pi) ‘tellabout O’; (115a-e) has Sa stems, and (115f-k) shows So stems.(114)        pono(pi) ‘tell O”                          Non-collective                                       Collective 1          ji-ponoo-se    in order to tell about me

“6 This surprising similarity is a strong indication of a diachronic connection. Cf. Meira 1998a:130ff for the
idea that the Habitual Past may have come from an earlier construction involving the Supine.
‘7 Presumably, t-adding stems (cf. 5.1.3) should occur in their t(i) form in the ‘indefinite O° Supine (as well as
in the ‘indefinite O’ negative; cf. 5.4.3.1.3), but the relevant data is unfortunately missing.

In several occasions, a Past Imperfective form was explained by speakerswith its Habitual Past equivalent, because it was             ‘easier’ or ‘simpler’. An older speakerclaimed that ‘young people don’t speak like this anymore’ (referring to a Past Imperfectiveform). Although further sociolinguistic research would certainly be necessary, a preliminaryimpression    is that the Past Imperfective       in Tiriyé has         a status    similar to that of theSubjunctive   in English,      or the passé    simple    in spoken       French:     it is recognized    andunderstood, but not really used.

In addition to the suffix -se, the Remote Past form has a prefix which basically has the form t- with vowel-initial stems                     and ti- with consonant-initial stems, with the following additional details:
          —     transitive and So stems must occur in their back grade if there is one (whichimplies the changes e > €, aCé > €Cé, and aCo > oCo; cf. 2.6.1 for Tiriy6 ablaut);         — Sa stems take the class-marking prefix w- before the prefix t-. On &-initial stems,the result is the sequence ti-w- (120m-n); on e-initial stems, the result is t- + lengthening ofthe initial e (1200-p; notice that this is idiosyncratic to combinations                     with the t- prefix,since the w- occurs as such on nominalizations without t- [cf. 4.2.2.1]). The two consonant-initial non-detransitivized stems ka ‘say’ and té[mil] ‘go’ take a ‘lengthened’ prefix tii- (cf.122q-r); the length can be seen as another realization of the class marker w-.*® The irregularstems ihté ‘go down’ and oeka / weka ‘defecate’, which take irregular initial consonants incertain forms (cf. 5.4.1.1.2), do not have them in the Remote Past (120s-t)(120a) aminé(pi)              “steal O”               —       t-aminéé-se           “stole; stolen’

Gildea 1998: 140ff). The t- -se(mi) nominalizer (cf. 4.2.2.1.2-3) isprobably a nominalized form of this older t- -se participle. It is still possible to find rareoccasional occurrences of the remote past form used as an adverbial (121); its meaning isthen quite compatible with that of t- -se(mi) nominalizations. Note that the A participant ismarked by the postposition _:ja (i.e. the t- -se form has ergative syntax; cf. 10.3.3).(121la) wéri        ni-tén         ti-pakoro-h_ta            _t-ééka-e          ékéi_ja

The best characterization of this situation seems to be that the Remote Pastmarks a past event which is as removed as possible from the present, with which it has little

It is the    ‘mythological        tense’ par excellence,     describing events        that happened in a ‘distant, far-away past’, in illo tempore. Note, in (122c), that the verb in thequotation is in the Perfective Past (it was said by one of the main characters of a narrativetext, for whom, obviously, the events of the story would not be remote), while the quotativeverb ka ‘say’ is in the Remote Past. “”(122a) kaikui t-éntahka-e             akuri_ja

One    of the verbal person     markers,   n(i)- (used ontransitive verbs when both participants are third persons), has the syntactic peculiarity ofbeing in complementary distribution with an overt preverbal object (cf. 5.4.1.1.1, 10.2.2).(16a-c) illustrate this fact:            A        n-V                  O                            A           O          Vv

Such behavior is reminiscent of e.g. French pronominal clitics such as il ‘him/it’,which is obligatory as a subject marker, but cannot co-occur with an overt subject (unlessa pause is inserted between the subject and the verb):

3.4.4. Postpositions. Postpositions can inflect for person (with the same markers used toindicate the possessor on nouns, the object on transitive verbs, and the subject on onesubgroup of intransitive verbs; cf. 3.3.1); they also have a reciprocal form (with a prefixalso found on     verbs    and on some      nouns;         cf. 3.3.1.4). They    can be morphologicallydistinguished from nouns and verbs in that they do not take typical noun or verb affixesother   than   person     markers;    moreover,      the     collective    number    of   the   object   of     apostposition is indicated with the suffix -:ne (instead of -ko(mo), used on nouns, or -ti(i),-té, -hki(i), used on verbs). Like adverbs, postpositions can take the nominalizing suffixes-(no) and (more rarely) -to.(34a)   k-éwe              ‘inside of us (=me and you)’
(b)     k-éwéé-ne          ‘inside of us (=all of us)’                     (collective marker -:ne)

Postpositional phrases behave like adverbs;therefore, they cannot be subjects or objects of verbs, or of other postpositions, withoutbeing nominalized.(35)    * j-epiné_pée

        Some   interrogatives   have   nominal   properties   (ati ‘what   (Inanimate)’,   aki   ‘who(Animate)’, aano     ‘which’); these are the interrogative pronouns. Others have adverbialproperties (aja ‘where to’, anpo ‘where’, eeke ‘how’, atitoome ‘why’, etc.); these are theinterrogative adverbs.

with object nominalizations of -nté/-hté (beneficiative) verbs, causees correlate with transitive verbs
causativized with the suffix -po (cf. 10.6.2.3), in the sense that the immediate interpretation of a _: ja-phrase
co-occurring with a causativized verb is that of a causee. Notice, however, that there are no ‘Causee-oriented
nominalizations’, either from the postposition _:ja or from causativized verb stems, which weakens the claim
for a Causee   participant.    It seems   simpler to say that the ‘causee reading’   of _:ja-phrases      in transitive
sentences with causativized verb stems is a question of context, not unlike a ‘preferred directional (allative)
reading’ of _:ja-phrases co-occurring with verbs of motion (18a-b).

One example, [pahko i-pawana] ‘my father’s friend’, has already been shown tohave all the characteristics of a phrase: its elements have an obligatory order (1c-d), theycannot be separated by pauses (2c-d) or by any other word (3a-b), and they can be followedby a second-position particle (Se-f, 6e-f).

           “Now, my daughter, she’s gone.’           There are cases of possessive noun phrases in which the possessed word is not in itsthird-person form. The label ‘N-N possessive phrase’ is used here to distinguish them fromthe regular (or “N i-N’) possessive phrases. (25) has an example. Notice that [wikapaupata] ‘the deer’s village’ is not a simple sequence of nouns (cf. 10.2.1.3) since, as (25b-c)show, its constituent order is inflexible, and it has the semantics of possession (‘the deer’svillage’, with        ‘deer’ being one of the characters          in a folk tale, not ‘a village which is(called)    deer’);    speakers    agree   in considering       [wikapau      pata]    and   [wikapau     i-pata]synonyms.      Furthermore,       the   possessive   suffix    -(ri)   (cf. 4.3.1.5)   can   occur   in the   N-Npossessive phrase (25d).(25a)      ma, ti-tunta-e,           mée,             wikapau pata_pona

        (26a) contains a regular N i-N possessive phrase, while (26b-c) have N-N phrases.(26d), however, suggests compounding: jaramata-pun looks like a single word for ‘chinflesh’. For this particular combination, the compound and the phrase options are bothavailable; in (26e-g), however, nka-pu(nu)                 ‘back flesh’ has only the compound option.®(26h-j) show a case of full lexicalization: not only is the N-N phrase option for nmapu(nu)impossible,     but     the   original    stem     *nma,         presumably         ‘behind’,   does    not      existsynchronically.

In possessive constructions, theyinstantiate the possessor and the possessed (28c). In copular sentences, only nouns canoccur in the predicate followed by the attributivizer postposition _me        (28d). When      adirect object noun precedes a transitive verb with a third-person subject, it fills the sameslot as the third-person prefix n-, which means that they cannot co-occur (28e-f). Thus, anoun immediately preceding the prefix n-, like ji-pawana ‘my friend’ in 28f, cannot be adirect object.(28a)        A          Vv               O

This is not typologically unusual (cf. e.g. Dixon             1982, Bhat 1994). (29) showsthat the word mono        ‘big’ is actually a noun, since it takes the attributivizer_me:(29)    mono _me_n-ai                   mée

They   are different fromprototypical nouns in that they cannot bear possessive morphology, and they do not takethe predilective suffix -sepi; they are also generally not used with postpositions, since thelatter can bear person-marking prefixes. In other regards, however, they behave as nouns.","[163, 164, 165]"
"10.1.3. Semantic-syntactic units: roles and grammatical                              relations. All languages           aresensitive to the relationship between events and participants, a relationship which includesboth semantic and pragmatic-discourse dimensions. Individual languages can differ in therelative importance they give to these dimensions (cf. e.g. Mithun & Chafe 1999). Some ofthem       give     precedence     to   semantic      considerations,         so     that      the     actual   perceivedcharacteristics        of   a given     participant     (e.g.     ‘volitionality’,          ‘control’,     ‘affectedness’,‘motility’,       ‘salience’,   etc.; cf. e.g. Mithun      1991,     Hardy     1988)         explain     its grammaticalbehavior, while others let pragmatic, discourse-oriented categories (e.g. ‘topic’, ‘rheme’,‘focus’,     ‘new    vs. given information’,       ‘determinacy’,       etc.; cf. Davis              1987a-b)   direct thechoice of grammatical possibilities. Classes of participants that are grammatically ‘treatedalike’ can be termed roles if they are semantically based, and grammatical relations if theirsource is elsewhere (usually, discourse pragmatics). However, if it is true that a clear-cut,all-or-nothing distinction between semantics and pragmatics is not possible (and sometimesnot even useful), it follows that no deep conceptual rift separates roles from grammaticalrelations. Many theories have taken strong positions about distinguishing them, and alsoabout the number of categories (‘Agent’, ‘Patient’, ‘Subject’, ‘Object’,                               ‘Topic’, etc.) thatthey should include; there might even be a ‘universal set’ of categories from which every

"5.1.3. T-adding stems. Certain verb stems have an unexpected prefix t- (ti-, if they areconsonant-initial) in the following forms, without any change in meaning:
         (a) nominalized forms without a preceding possessor (cf. 4.2.2.1);         (b) second-person imperative forms without a preceding object (cf. 5.4.2.1);         (c) third-person (prefixless) hypothetical forms (with the suffix -i; cf. 5.4.1.3.5);?         (d) supine (cf. 5.4.3.1.1) and indefinite negative (cf. 5.4.3.1.3) forms.*
3 Presumably, the same is true for the other non-factual forms (e.g. the incredulitive and admonitive forms),
but the necessary examples did not occur in the available corpus.
* The verb stem ée(pi) has an irregularity that looks related: it takes an unexpected t- prefix in its negative (t-
&e-sewa, t-ee-sewa; cf. 5.4.3.1.3) and ‘Actual S’ nominalized (t-éeh-ke(ti); cf. 4.2.2.1.3) forms. Note that

is dropped, without the i being retained (7f, h, j), the consonant-initial analysis is preferred.

"
        Despite the relatively small size of the postpositional category, its members do notform a coherent whole with respect to the above properties. In fact, the best descriptionseems   to   be   that    of   a prototype   category:   there   are    more,    or   less,   prototypicalpostpositions,    which    can be ordered    along a continuum.        This   situation   is described   insection 7.2. Before that, however, it is useful to examine the morphological possibilitiesof postpositions; this is the goal of section 7.1. Section 7.3. contains a presentation of allpostpositions known thus far, classified according to semantic and formal criteria.",[393]
"          Typological studies on adjectives have stressed that the link between                           ‘propertyconcepts’     and    a specific   lexical class     is subject      to cross-linguistic          variation.     Somelanguages (e.g. English) have a clear adjectival class, while others tend to distribute‘property     concepts’    elsewhere:     in the    nominal       class     (e.g.    Sanskrit,    Quechua,       mostAustralian languages), in the verbal class (e.g. Iroquoian and Siouan languages), or inboth (e.g. Japanese, according to Wetzer 1996:50). Discourse-pragmatic explanations forthis split (such as Hopper         & Thompson           1984, Thompson              1988, or Bhat      1994)     haveStressed the functional basis of the category:               adjectives        are used for predication            andmodification. Interestingly enough, Tiriyé adverbs can be used for predication, but mustbe nominalized before they can be used for modification (cf. 10.2.1.3). This suggests that
' There are two ‘property concepts’ outside of this category: the nouns mono             ‘big (one)’ and kaina(no)
‘new/young (one).’ However, they are rather exceptional, and may have been diachronically derived (their
final syllable looks like the -(no) nominalizer [cf. 4.2.2.2]; for mono, a connection with the augmentative
suffix -imé [cf. 4.2.1.2] may be suggested).

Tiriy6 treats modification as ‘nouny’, though Tiriy6 is still different from languages likeSanskrit or Quechua in that ‘property concepts’ are not originally nouns, but adverbs.","[364, 365]"

         The “genitive classifier’ analysis of these constructions is not adopted here, for thefollowing reasons:
         (a) Some of the nouns possessed via classifiers are not really non-possessible. Forinstance, oroi ‘cashew’ and tuna ‘water’ are possessible: ji-j-oroi means                           ‘my cashew tree’,and jii-na ‘my water (for bathing, etc.)’ (cf. 4.3.1.1).         (b) The    possibility of an appositional               analysis    for (36a-d)    looks    more     appealing,especially in view of the existence of examples such as (37a-c) below:(37a)   ji-pawana    taréne               (b)     j-eemi           kawé-no            (c)   ji-nmuku Asehpé

         No syntactic difference was found between (36a-e) and (37a-c) that could justify theuse of a different label for (36a-e); for instance, pauses can be inserted in all these exampleswithout dramatic      semantic    consequences.'®            Although       changes   in order imply        changes     in

          The     semantic    changes     illustrated    in     (38a-d)       suggest     that    ‘appositional     phrases’involving one possessed element are ‘tighter’                       than those that only involve non-possessedwords. However, the clearly phrasal status of the possessive phrase [pahko eki] ‘my father’spet’    with respect to a second-position            particle can be contrasted                  with   the more    dubiousbehavior of jeki kaikui          ‘my pet dog’ in the same situation.

classifiers at some point. However, there does not seem to be any grammatical (as opposed to e.g. statistical)
reason yet to treat (36a-e) as different from (37a-c).

         The main general purpose construction in Tiriy6 is formed with a circumstance(-to(po))      nominalization   occurring     in     a postpositional      phrase   with     the   attributivizerpostposition _me. Like the supine (cf. 10.4.1.2.1), -too_me clauses can be used with verbsof motion      (88a-b), but it is not limited to them. This construction             is so frequent in thissense, that some authors (e.g. Gildea             1998:138ff) analyze it as having become           a new verbform in at least some Cariban languages; however, in the absense of clear evidence forreanalysis, it seems       simpler to consider this as one more case of the general pattern: anominalization in a postpositional phrase used to express an adverbial notion. Note also(88f), which deviates from the general causal semantics of -too_me, and (88g), where itoccurs as the complement in a syntactic causative construction.

At the current stage of our knowledge, however, the following remark seems valid:           —     In order to understand           the behavior of Tiriy6 participants, semantic                   features(‘volitionality’,      ‘affectedness’,      ‘control’, etc.) do not seem crucial. Participants               that showall kinds of combinations of these features (e.g. the A participants of stems like tuuka ‘hitO’   and ene      ‘see O’, or the S participants of the S, and So verb stems listed in 5.2.2 and5.3.1.1)       seem   to   have   the     same    the   same      morphosyntactic      possibilities.      The      variouspossible       subgroupings       of participants,          and   the   morphosyntactic        treatment     that     thesegroupings receive, seem to be more insightfully understandable as consequences                                    of theirhistory. Thus, once one realizes that the t- -se(mi) nominalizer and the t- -se ‘Remote Past’are historically connected (cf. 4.2.2.1.2), the fact that both are involved in ergative patternsceases to look like a coincidence;               the same is true for the Negative, Supine              and HabitualPast constructions (cf. 5.4.3.1). In the spirit of Gildea (to appear), who suggests that wordorder for certain constructions may be a consequence of their diachronic evolution ratherthan the result of general discourse tendencies in the language, it may be proposed that casemarking        and syntactic alignment           patterns     may sometimes       be   ‘fossil remnants          of olderconstructions’        rather than indicators of synchronic meaning. The best candidate for thisinterpretation is the “‘epiphenomenal split-S system’ as described in 5.2.2.","[529, 530]"

Tiriy6 speakers are even aware of them as a ‘classification’ of types of animals. Rather, they are presented
simply as they are: terms for groups of animals that the Tiriy6 thought useful to put together. Thus, words
such as pereru ‘butterfly’ or nere ‘bat’ are not included, since, although they include hundreds of species of
actual animals (and although the Tiriyé are aware that not all butterflies and not all bats are ‘the same’),
since these words are not used as generic terms (with specific names for different subgroups), but as simple
terms for groups of animals that the Tirly6 consider one ‘species’.
8 One speaker allowed é€né to be possessed, making a j-adding stem of it (ji-jéémé ‘my pet’); he considered
the result equivalent to j-eki. This fact is reminiscent of the ‘dubious possessibility’ of animal names (cf.
4.3.1.4.2, 4.3.1.1).

Oto refers to game animals thatlive on the ground,         i.e. mostly mammals:          pakira    ‘collared peccary’, ponjeke             ‘white-lipped peccary’, pai ‘tapir’, akuri ‘agouti’, kurimau                   ‘paca’, wikapau, kajaké, aruma“deer spp.’, etc. Méhparé refers to either birds or monkeys, a category which is, at first,rather surprising, but can be understood if one realizes that a hunter, in order to kill theseanimals, has to point upwards; besides, as one speaker put it, these are the animals thatcan ‘attack you from above’.”","[615, 616]"

The synchronic pattern of syllable reduction, according towhich    certain     stems    have   several   forms      (grades)    differing     by   one     syllable    has     beendescribed in 2.6.2. To recapitulate briefly, the syllable that differentiates the grades (thereducing syllable, either the first or the last of the stem) can occur as a full syllable, or thenreduce to one of three possible forms: a single consonant (h, if the non-reduced syllableStarts with a stop, r ors; n, if it starts with a nasal), lengthening of the preceding vowel, ornothing at all. The allomorph of the stem in which the full syllable occurs is the full grade;the others (the reduced grades) are the coda grade (in which the syllable occurs as h or n),the length grade (in which the reducing syllable occurs as vowel lengthening), and the zerograde (in which the reducing syllable is dropped). The occurrence of the different grades isconditioned by affixes of different syllabic structures (cf. 2.6.2 for details and examples). Incited forms, the reducing syllable is written in parentheses.","[248, 249]"

         An imperative verb does not seem to form a verb phrase with a preceding O nounphrase either, as is shown by the obligatory positioning of the second-position particle _moafter the O noun phrase in (48) rather than after the verb (cf. 5.4.2.1 for the use of _mo inthe future imperative). It is, however, true that the objects are always preverbal.Atempts toposition them postverbally usually cause negative reactions (unless a pause is inserted,suggesting an afterthought; (48c-e)).

It isnot clear at present whether this fact should be treated as a consequence of more generalword order properties of Tiriyd, or as evidence for an “emergent verb phrase’ (or, at least,for some sort of higher-level constituent at an intermediate level between verb phrase andclause).","[557, 558]"

 3.4.3. Adverbs. Unlike verbs, nouns and postpositions, non-derived adverbs cannot take any person-marking or collective affixes (derived adverbs                 are usually similar to non-derived ones     in this respect).         Their morphology       is limited to nominalizing       suffixes,usually -(no), but also -to (both of which are also used to nominalize postpositions).(32a)    kure    ‘well, good, pretty’          —=       kura-no     ‘good one, pretty one’

         As for syntactic properties,          adverbs tend to modify the verb in non-copularsentences   (33a);   in order to refer to a noun,          they must    be nominalized    (33b).    Unlikenouns,   adverbs cannot occupy the same slot as the third-person verbal prefix n-, whichremains in place when they are placed before the verb (33e-f). Adverbs also cannot befollowed by postpositions, or by the attibutivizer _me (33c-d).(33a)    kure   w-ene              weéri                (Adverb modifying a verb)

There are no particlesspecialized        in    interclausal          coordination     (like    English       ‘and’,      ‘but’,    etc.);   rather,   theconjunctions listed in 9.1.1 can be used both to link clauses within an intonationally definedsentence and to relate sentences to each other within the text. Compare the interclausalképéewa       in    (92a),       with    the    ‘intersentential’       képéewa      in   (92b),      the    formal    differencebetween them being basically intonational.

"If wéri and kawéno are separated by the verb, their propensity for coreferentiality is greatlyreduced, which is indicated by the question mark preceding the coreferential interpretationin (34d-e). It is much easier to interpret the ‘afterthought’ as referring to the person who istalking (the S participant) than to the woman.               This can be       ‘corrected’ by repeating thepostposition _pé(ké), as in (34f-g). This behavior suggests a closer bond between wéri andkawéno    in (34a-b), where there is no need to repeat the postposition in order to preventkawéno from referring to the person who is talking.",[548]

 ~ The postposition (j)apo is also j-adding; cf. 7.1.1.
 3 This borrowing, ultimately from Dutch horloge, is apparently limited to Surinam. In the Brazil villages,
 the possessed form of the word wei ‘sun; dry season’ is used instead (cf. (57c) above).

Thus, alienability does not seem to be the common thread here. Given thecurrently available data, what can be said is that this j occurs on vowel-initial plant (andmarginally     animal)     names,     and   on    many   (but    not     all)   borrowings       from   Westernlanguages:     (j)akusa,    (j)isireti from      Portuguese     agulha      ‘needle’,   gilete   ‘razor blade’,(j)oroke, (j)oroisi from the creole languages of Surinam, ultimately from English work orDutch werk, and Dutch horloge ((j)o probably belongs here as well, though its source isunknown); but arakapusa ‘rifle’ (Portuguese, Spanish arcabuz).”>4.3.1.4.3.

Like all languages, Tiriyé certainly borrowed many words from otherlanguages    during   its history;   however,    given     the lack of detailed              lexicographic    andcomparative studies for Amazonia, it is currently impossible to separate, in most cases,borrowings    from native Cariban words (but cf. Rodrigues                      1985 for cases of apparentborrowings    between     Cariban    and   Tupian     languages).          At    present,    like   many     otherAmazonian languages, Tiriy6 is borrowing many words from the surrounding languages,

"3.2. Morphological units. Morphology is concerned with the description and analysis ofwords and the smaller units which compose                      them (the morphemes).            In the precedingchapter, the concept of phonological word was introduced as the domain of rhythmicstress (cf. 2.3.2)    and described as a sequence                of syllables    with certain distributionalconstraints (cf. 2.4.1). However, as is the case in most languages, the phonological wordin Tiriy6 is not always equivalent to the grammatical word, due to the existence of cliticelements:(la)    m-eta_pa?

        ‘Did you hear my father again?’                           “You would eat its meat.’        The particles _pa ‘Repetition’ and _mo ‘Irrealis’ are clitics; their status is markedby the underscore character which separates them from the preceding word. Instead ofbeing a necessary element of a specific word in a sentence, they are placed in a specificposition within the sentence (in this case, after the first constituent; cf. 10.1.2). However,
                                                                                                       LiLthey form a single phonological word with the preceding element, according to both therhythmic stress (2a) and to syllable reduction (cf. the coda grade of méneh                   of méne(pi)“you came’ in 2b).(2a)      meta   + _pa     —    meta_pa_         [me.td:.pa]            ‘you heard again’

The phonological word, as previously defined,remains     as the basic unit of higher-level        phonology    (stress, intonation,       phonologicalphrases, etc.; but cf. 2.6.3.1.2 for reduplication as an exceptional case). A grammaticalword will be defined here as either (a) a clitic, or (b) a phonological word without anyclitic material. This allows clitics to remain independent from the words to which theyattach (their host). In addition, clitics tend to have morphosyntactic properties that aresufficient to place them in one of the definable lexical classes (usually particles orpostpositions, but also a few verbs), together with other elements                  that are not clitics.","[131, 132]"

Notice that _ta(ike) can be used forconstituent negation (69i-m).(69a)   pahko_ta ~ pahko_taa_n-ai                  (b)      pahko_wa        ~      pahko_waa_n-ai

        The supine (‘purpose-of-motion’) form of the verb is negated with _ta(ike) (70a),which puts it closer to adverbs (cf. 5.4.3.1.1, 10.4.1.2.2, 10.4.1.3.3). Curiously enough, the

Meira 1998a:120ff, L36ff for a hypothesis on the historical development of the negativeand habitual past forms from the supine). The remote past is also negated with _ta(ike)(70d-e).(70a)      méré_pona      wi-tén         emamina-e_ta

The negative equivalent of a conjugated             (Set D clause is acopular or equative clause built around the negative form of the corresponding verb stem(cf. 5.4.3.1.3): in order to say ‘I don’t kill birds’, Tiriyé speakers use ‘I am birds not-killing’(71a-f). Like the habitual past, the negative form follows a nominative pattern of personmarking, in that the O participant can occur as a person prefix on the negated verb stemwhile the A and S participants must be either noun phrases or person prefixes on the copula
                                                                                               559
 e(i). There is some evidence that a preverbal O noun phrase forms a verb phrase with the verb, but the data are scant (cf. 10.2.2). The optional occurrence of the copula makes the negative clause look structurally different from the habitual past; a further difference is theidiosyncratic third-person O prefix im-, which does not occur on habitual past forms (71b).","[577, 578, 579, 580]"

33 Gildea 1995, based on comparative evidence, suggests that /rV/ syllables follow a different path of
evolution and thus develop idiosyncratic morphophonological properties. In Tiriy6, they seem to be
responsible for most of the cases of irregularities. It is interesting to notice, for instance, that the reducing
suffix /-(ti)/ ‘Possession’ occurs in the coda grade (/-h/) when followed by /t/- or /p/-initial clitics or suf-
fixes, but not /k/-initial ones: /ji-pakoro-h_tao/ ‘in my house’, /ji-pakoro-h_pona/ ‘toward my house’, but
/ki-pakoro-:-kon/ ‘our house’, not */ki-pakoro-h-kon/.
   Among the /ri/-final reducing verbs, there is one verb, /epori/ ‘meet O’, which presents an unexpected
irregularity: along with its regular full grade, coda grade (e.g. /w-epoh-tae/ ‘I will meet 0”), and length
grade (e.g. /epoo-se/ ‘in order to meet 0’), it has an allomorph /epon/ that co-occurs exclusively with the
/-ne/-past suffix (e.g. /w-epon-ne/ ‘I met O’).

"        The non-second-person imperatives refer to people other than the hearer and areusually not orders stricto sensu.     A special hortative    (‘let us’) form   is attested;   for otherpersons, a construction with the jussive (‘let him’) particle éwé(h) is used.

of K-Tiriy6 areas.

10.3.1. Equative (‘verbless’) clauses. The combination of a two noun phrases (54a-b), or anoun phrase and a postpositional phrase (54c-h), or a noun phrase and an adverb (54i) or aparticle (54j-l), can occur as a well-formed utterance in Tiriyé. The second element formsthe predicate, with the first noun phrase as its ‘subject’.'® If this ‘subject’ is understood, thepredicate    can occur by itself:       (54g)    is actually much          more     frequent    as a single-wordutterance.(54a)    seré, AIDS, epiti-min                                      (ob)    j-eka              Ranpi

'§ As there is no verb in an equative sentence, it is difficult to assign its ‘subject’ to one of the participant
types discussed in 10.4.1. Its similarities with copular sentences suggest that it could be considered an S
participant.

"11.1   Introduction.    Of   all   areas    of a language,     the   first   one   to    receive   somedocumentation is the lexicon. For many languages, word lists remain the only kind ofavailable information. However, most of the lexicon of a language, usually comprisingthousands of words, remains almost always unexplored beyond the first few dozen wordscollected by early explorers. In the field of Cariban linguistics, very little lexicographicwork   has been done:    with the exception         of Ahlbrinck     1931    for Carib of Surinam(Kari’na), Armellada 1943 and Armellada & Salazar 1981 for Pemon, Williams                     1932 forMakushi,   and Mattei-Muller       1998    for Panare,   there are no    published      dictionaries   ofCariban languages. Specific semantic fields are also almost never considered in detail,except for anthropological studies on the studies on kinship terms.",[604]
"In the cases with a preceding object or possessor, however, not all speakers left the t(i)-element off; to some of them, (7f, h, j) were as good as (8a-c) below.® Note also that thet(1)- element cannot in general be characterized as occurring on ‘objectless’ forms, sinceforms that have no O-marking prefixes (as the -té adverbialization in (8e-f)) do not haveany t(i)-.(8a)       é-ekY fti-pi-ké!

         The   element     t(f) cannot   be analyzed      as a reducing    syllable,   since it occurs   as asingle consonant t- on vowel-initial stems, and it does not have the expected allomorphicpattern (for instance, there is no coda grade of a t-adding stem in which the t(i) occurs as anh; forms such as *wi-hpi-i_mo and *mi-hpi-i_mo were immediately corrected to (7a-b)).",[254]
"3.3.1. Argument marking. The three major classes — nouns, postpositions, and verbs —can be thought of as those which are compatible with argument marking. For these threeclasses, certain morphological processes are used to mark the presence or absence of anargument, and to further identify it if it is present, either by explicitly marking its personcategory (e.g. a first- or second-person argument), or by relating it to other entities alreadyknown      to the hearer (e.g. ‘the same as the subject’,           ‘different from the subject’, etc.).

 Some of these morphological processes are very widespread (e.g. the first-person markerj(i)- occurs          on    most    nouns,      most    verbs,    and    most   postpositions),        whereas     others     arerestricted (e.g. the first-person marker s- only occurs on a specific subclass of verbstems),       but the semantic             categories       which     they instantiate     have    the same        degree      ofgenerality (e.g. all possessible nouns and conjugatable verbs and postpositions have afirst-person form).","[153, 154]"

7.3.4.4. The      postposition      _pe(ke)    ‘Negative     Attributivizer’.       Like _me,    _pe(ke)    alsoallows   a noun     to be used      as an adverb       (i.e. both are      ‘denominalizers’),    and both    areconcerned       with attributing     properties     of their object to some          other participant.     Thedifference lies in the fact that, while _me attributes all the properties of its object, _pe(ke)does not; in fact, it implies that important properties of its object are not to be attributed(75c-d). The end result is that of attributing the status of a ‘bad’, ‘imperfect’,                 ‘wrong’ or‘unsatisfactory’ member of the category in question.(75a)    &-pawanaa_pee_w-a-e                               (b)      maja_pee_n-ai

           ‘This is a bad, worthless, evil knife.’              ‘This one is a bad, evil person.’           The first noteworthy difference is that maja-npé and maja-ripi are nouns, whilemaja_pe is not a noun; maja-npé            and maja-ripi can be subjects or objects of verbs,objects of postpositions, etc., while maja_pe cannot.

"The postposition _se has several formal irregularities (cf. 7.1.1).(56a)    pakoro_se_w-a-e'’                                         (b)       é-ene_se_n-ai

becomes stressed, but without length: (56a) is pronounced [pa.k55.[5.se.vae], not *[pa.k54.ro.s€€.vae] (cf.
2.5.1 for the iambic stress system). One possible explanation would be to assume that _se is actually _hse
(cf. 2.4.2.2 for the instability of /hs/ clusters); this would agree with the fact that the reciprocal form of _se,
éése ‘wanting each other’, is consistently given as having an /éhse/ by those speakers who had /hs/ clusters.
There is no apparent reason for this /h/; comparative evidence has thus far failed to show any evidence of
there having ever been an extra syllable which might have reduced to /h/ in this position. One possibility is
that this behavior may have been an indirect consequence of intervocalic /s/ loss (cf. Meira 1998:31ff):
since word-internal /s/ was preserved only if the preceding syllable had reduced (presumably by becoming
fh/), sf and a preceding /h/ would have ‘blended’; and this blend would then have been extended
analogically to cases such as the postposition _se. This hypothesis needs further research.

The object of these postpositions representsthe ‘knower’ (or ‘not-knower’,     ‘ignorer’). The objectless adverbs waaré         ‘understandable,clear’ (S7e) and wame(ke) (57f) ‘difficult to understand’ (synonymous with antiinao [cf.7.3.1.2.2.] and énkume [cf. below]). The reciprocal forms éiwaaré and éiwame(ke) canalso mean ‘intelligent, smart’ and ‘stupid’, respectively (57g-h; cf. 7.1.3 for the reciprocalusage). The   adverb   tiwaaré   ‘careful;   worried; jealous’,   which   looks   like the reflexive(‘3R’) form of waaré (cf. 7.1.1 above), is quite different in meaning (57i-j); it is probablybest analyzed as an independent t-adverb (cf. 6.2.1.1).

If the object is an event, epona expresses the belief that it will happen(65c). The objectless adverb €pona means          ‘who believes in everything; credulous; whohelps everybody’ (65d).

        ‘Iam credulous; I believe in anything; I help everybody.’        Epona apparently comes from the conjugated form of the directional postposition_pona (cf. 7.3.1.1.2); in fact, a form like j-epona is still ambiguous between ‘toward me’and ‘trusting/believing in me’. Given the existence of the objectless form épona (65d),and the contrast between epona and _pona in the context of an overt nominal object (e.g.compare (65a) to pakoro_pona ‘to(ward) the house’), epona and _pona will be analyzedas independent postpositions which become homophonous when conjugated.","[438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443]"
