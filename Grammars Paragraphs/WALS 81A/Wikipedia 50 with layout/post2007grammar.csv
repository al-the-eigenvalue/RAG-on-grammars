        If the predicate head is intransitive (whether it is an intransitive verb or an
adjective), the S argument is, like A, always unmarked. This is true whether the S
argument of a particular intransitive verb is assigned the same or a similar semantic role
to that of the A argument of another, transitive, verb (or transitive sense of the same verb),
or, perhaps, the same semantic role as the other verb’s O argument (as with an S=O
ambitransitive verb). In (849), the intransitive verb dá- ‘feel around, using one’s foot’
                         4206H
seems to subcategorize for (more or less) the same sort of Actor S as we find assigned to
the A argument of úp- ‘grope, using one’s hands’ (850). This is a semantically quite

subject nominalizer -nà ‘NZR:SUB’ refers to the S or A argument of an intransitive ortransitive stem respectively (853)-(854); non-subject nominalizer -nam ‘NZR:NSUB’ cannot

       ‘Has he you beaten me/you/him/himself (yet)?’       Similarly, most types of hortatives and imperatives are sensitive to subject person;
for example, non-inclusive (unmarked) imperatives require a second person subject while
inclusive hortatives require a first person dual or plural subject (independent of object
type). For discussion and examples, see §9.5.2.

14.1.3.5. Evidence from pivots (cross-clause coreferentiality)
       Although Galo does not robustly exhibit the strongly subject-oriented pivots and
switch-reference functions in its clause chains which are found in many other clause
chaining languages (§16.4.2.2.3), the sets of restrictions and possibilities which do exist
                      42H
appear to always make reference either to S/A or to a syntactic non-subject.
       For example, in an embedded temporal subordination (§16.4.3.2), an ellipsed
                                                                       423H

              Similarly, a clausal adverbial subordination in Stative imperfective aspect exhibits
       a “disjunct” constraint against cross-clause subject coreference (§12.5.2.3, §16.5.4.3). In
                                                                              425H          426H

              (TR, FS 008)14.1.3.6. Evidence from constituent order
              Unlike in some languages (such as English), constituent order is at best a weak
correlate of grammatical relations in Galo. Although the statistically most frequent Galo
constituent order is without question A O V, when the O argument is definite and
referential – meaning that it is obligatorily marked in the accusative – constituents may be
arranged in the most pragmatically useful order. Thus, there is a pragmatic difference
between (862)-(863) (in (863), O sounds more focal/contrastive), but there is no
                4231H   423H    423H
grammatical/semantic difference, nor any hint of potential confusion.","[687, 688, 689, 690]"
"          Accordingly, the following set of core argument structures are established, in
which S, A, O and E refer both to the set of core arguments assigned to a predicate and to
their syntactic realization in a particular clause headed by that predicate, and (OBL) refers
to any number of oblique (a.k.a. “adjunct”, “peripheral” or “non-core” noun phrases).
Oblique noun phrases may provide some additional information regarding, but do not
directly support, the core sense of the predicate (Figure 14.1).

14.1.2. Relationship between semantic roles, argument types and syntactic
          realizations
          The literature abounds with proposals as to how the relationship between semantic
roles, argument types and syntactic realizations should be construed, both in universal-
grammatical (or universal-cognitive) senses and in senses developed with respect to                                                  683
particular languages or types of languages, and assessment of even a small portion of
these proposals nowadays must lie well beyond the scope of a descriptive grammar. I
simply outline here the approach which I have found useful in the analysis of Galo
grammar, and readily concede that any number of more efficient or insightful proposals
may be adduced, either with respect to human language overall or with respect to Galo in
particular. 263   26F
                First, in some “underlying” sense, we can understand a verb to be
“subcategorized” for a set of zero or more arguments, as outlined in Figure 14.1. Next (in
                                                                                 4195H
an analytical rather than procedural sense of “next”), we can understand these core
arguments to be underlyingly associated with a set of semantic types, in the sense of a
lexicon-internal “construction”. Potentially, a large set of verbs may assign a similar or
identical set of semantic types to the same basic set of arguments (for example, a large set
of “state change” verbs may assign Agent and Theme roles to A and O arguments
respectively); or, there may be a more detailed semantic specification of the type of
nominal which can stand in a particular argument position (for example, one existential
verb may subcategorize for an animate S while another may subcategorize for an
inanimate S). In principle, this assignment could be viewed as arbitrary, however in
practice, of course, more agentive semantic roles are generally assigned to the A
argument position and less agentive roles to the O argument position.
        Then, we come to the syntactic realization of the arguments in a particular clause,
as they are “projected” by the predicate as a function of its head (usually, a verb, but
possibly also an adjective); at this point only, it becomes possible to talk of “grammatical
relations”, or higher-order alignments of certain argument types in opposition to others. In
Galo, we find good evidence for the grammaticalization of S/A alignment in opposition to
the “core remainder” O and/or E , and may therefore begin to speak of, for example, the“subject” of a particular clause, as it may be identified in terms of a set of criteria to be
outlined in §14.1.3. The projected instantiations of underlying, verb-subcategorized A, O
                        4196H
and so on are thus recognized in terms of these identified mapping relations (A onto
“subject”, etc.).
        Figure 14.2 roughly schematizes this conception:
        4197H
263
   My principle informing influences have been the construction-based grammar of Croft (2001), and the
inductive, typologically-oriented proposals of Basic Linguistic Theory, particularly as developed by Dixon
and colleagues (Dixon 1979; Dixon 1994; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2000).

Figure 14.2 – Schematization of the derivation from lexical entry to clausal projection, and its
              interpretation
         To be quite clear, I am claiming that in Galo, as (seemingly) opposed to a number
of nearby languages – particularly of Tibeto-Burman stock – direct marking of core
argument semantic roles vis a vis the predicate does not occur. 264 Instead, we must posit
                                                                         263F
levels of structure both within the lexicon and within the clause syntax to account for the
behaviour of Galo noun phrases and their interpretation. This fact suggests to me, at least,
that Galo has undergone grammaticalization of, possibly, particular pragmatic-
organizational processes (such as interclausal argument co-reference constraining
strategies) which other related languages of the area may not have, possibly as part of an
overall shift in its basic typology. In-depth exploration of this topic lies well outside the
scope of this work; however, I would suggest that much might be learned from a future
study of this nature.","[683, 684, 685]"

individuated but unidentifiable (and therefore, not case-marked) referents occur in the
same transitive clause, in conditions where it would be pragmatically unknowable which
was more likely to be understood as the relatively more active/agentive. 266 In such a case,
                                                                                      265F

conceivably be taken as weak evidence for a preferred Subject-Object-Verb order;
however, it would be difficult to clearly establish that the interpretation would not in fact
be due to some inferred pragmatic relations – i.e., that the initial noun phrase is more
topical – together with an inferred likelihood that the more topical participant would tend
to be more agentive.

14.1.3.7. Non-occurrence of passive
         By “passive”, I understand a marked morphosyntactic operation of
detransitivization, in which the object is “raised” to subject position, and in which the
notional subject (underlying A) is expressed, or is expressible, as an oblique (Dixon 1994:
146). The presence of a passive construction in a language is often taken as strong
evidence for grammaticalization of and/or functional use of the grammatical relations of
“subject” and “object”. In Galo, however, despite relatively robust evidence for subject as
outlined in above sections, there is no marked syntactic construction in which a notional
subject is expressed or expressible as a main-clause-level oblique noun phrase, hence no
morphosyntactic “passive” as such. There are derivational operations which appear to
operate at the word level on the argument structure of predicates and the semantic roles
which are assigned to them, enabling semantic interpretations which render them
functionally similar to passives, 267 but none with the precise syntactic consequences

         Above subsections reviewed evidence for the grammatical relation “subject” in
terms of intransitive and transitive clause types, using “object” as an informal label for the
syntactic realization of O. Turning to clause types with extended core argument structures,
however, the evidence for “object” becomes somewhat less categorical.
         In an extended transitive clause headed by a predicate in zí- ‘give’ – or elsederived by the related Benefactive applicative -zí – both O and E arguments are typicallymarked in the accusative (865).4235H
267
    Cf. especially the ‘Reversive’ suffix -kò (§11.2.5.8), which has the effect of causing the argument roles
of A and O to be reversed (schematically, I hit-ko him, in which ‘him’ is understood as Agent and ‘I’ as
Patient). However, predicate marking in -kò seems to have no syntactic consequences at all, hence is not a
“passivizing” morpheme.
268
    I do not take the absence of a passive in Galo to argue against the relevance of passive constructions to
the description of grammatical relations in general. Rather, I would say that simply having the grammatical
relation “subject” does not in itself predict the presence of a passive. Inasmuch as a language may have one
or more other means of expressing a transitive non-actor in subject position, as is the case in Galo, there
may simply be no functional pressure to grammaticalize a true passive construction.

    Some speakers claim that dative-marking of E is “more correct” than marking in the accusative, which
could represent a relatively recent innovation. That claim notwithstanding, accusative-marking of E
arguments in ‘give’ type clauses is overwhelmingly more frequent than dative-marking in my data, and
seems quite independent of speaker age or geographical background; of course, a larger and more diverse
corpus than is currently available to me could eventually reveal patterned differences in their distribution.
270
    Another way of interpreting these data would be to suggest that (868) is not an internally-headed
relativization at all, but rather represents a variety of incorporation of the O argument noun phrase into the
grammatical predicate. The fact remains that E does not appear to have access to this operation (cf.
§15.3.1.3.2).

be underlyingly subcategorized for E arguments. For example, Goal arguments of motion
verbs and Theme arguments of throw verbs are both referenced by non-subject
nominalizer -nam – as ín-nam mookò ‘go-NZR:NSUB place’ ‘place which was gone to’ andnáa-nam ɨlɨ ̀ɨ ‘throw.at-NZR:NSUB stone’ ‘stone which was thrown at
(something/someone)’. However, their marking at the clause level is quite different; Goal
arguments of motion verbs are usually either unmarked for case, or are marked in the
locative (although accusative marking is possible in a limited, “experiential” sense; see
§14.3.2.3), while Theme arguments of transfer verbs are generally marked as topical

instruments (§14.2.2.1.2.1).
                 421H
        In sum, E arguments align with O arguments in some respects (accessibility to
Accusative case-marking and Non-subject nominalization) but not in others (consistent
Accusative case-marking and accessibility to internally-headed relativization).
        At the same time, E arguments are distinct from obliques, despite that their
syntactic marking may sometimes overlap. Consider the oblique temporal and mediative
noun phrases, which initiate and terminate the sentence in (869).

with no overt marker of dependency. As such, most modifying nominals are structurally
identical to compound elements, and may be analysed in the same context. For example, a
collocation such as amée-taalíi ‘brass.bridal.platter-plate(<Ind)’ ‘brass bridal platter’could be viewed either as a syntactic MOD-H construction, or as a productively-formed
lexical compound. Such “two-term” N-N compounds are discussed in §5.3.1.4. Although
                                                                           2374H
there seems in principle to be no lexical restrictions on the types of nominal which can
stand in the modifying nominal position, in practice, deverbal participant nominalizations
are interpreted not as modifying nominals per se, but rather as relative clauses (§15.3.1.3).
                                                                                     2375H
Furthermore, it is more likely that semantically more descriptive nouns occur in the
modifying nominal position, although this seems to be a matter of construal; for example,
ɨlɨ ̀ɨ-aapùk ‘stone-heart’ ‘stubborn temperament’ (also zero-derived for use as an adjective
                                                292
‘obdurate’) represents a metaphorical construal of a decidedly concrete, in principle non-
descriptive type of noun ‘stone’ in modifying nominal position.","[291, 292, 293]"
"§3.2.4). In short, phonological criteria suggest that this is not one but rather two words.
         Following the generally-accepted framework summarized in Dixon and
Aikhenvald (2002), as set forth in numerous previous works by them and other scholars,
this disconnect will be described here in terms of a difference between two types of unit:
“grammatical word” and “phonological word”. 71 The following subsections review
criteria by which these units may be identified. Some of these criteria involve
exceptionless (or rarely violable) rules, while others consist of more probabilistic
tendencies. In some cases, the convergence among or contrast between grammatical and
phonological words is robust, as in (17)-(18) above. In other cases, the analysis hinges on
thin and contextually variable criteria. The resulting picture is complex, perhaps in some
ways unsatisfyingly so. However, it must be recalled that Galo has heretofore been an
instrument for oral, face-to-face communication, and has not been significantly shaped by
conventionalization for writing purposes. Many of the difficulties found (by linguists and
native speakers alike) in consistently segmenting utterances into “words” for the purpose
of writing the language (as we are doing here) are, when speaking, simply a non-issue. 72
71
   This sense of “grammatical word” is not to be confused with another, unrelated sense in which
“grammatical word” denotes words which have as their value a grammatical function as opposed to a
lexical meaning, i.e. (in English) words like “the”, “to”, and “and” as opposed to “boat” and “tree”. To
avoid confusion, in the present work we use the term “grammatical word” in the Dixon-Aikhenvald sense of
opposition to “phonological word” and the term “function word” to refer to words with grammatical-
functional as opposed to lexical status.
72
   It is also instructive to consider that the word for ‘word’ in Galo agóm (< PTs *gom ‘speech; voice’) also
has the related senses ‘speech’, ‘language’, ‘utterance’, and ‘matter/point’. Thus, it might be more accurate
to gloss agóm as something like ‘communicum’ in the sense of ‘unit and/or medium of communication’,
without regard to segmentation or length. According to this definition (and according to Galo speakers’
usual judgments), both phonological and grammatical words may qualify as agóm (even when these do not
coincide), but neither roots nor affixes do. One might note here a potential similarity with Tibetan (among
other languages), in which multiword utterances, rather than words per se, are separated by spaces when
writing (Sprigg 1955). Importantly, such types contrast with the traditional Chinese concept of the basic
unit of language, the zǐ, which has a lower-level denotation including roots and morphemes, but no unit
                                                    153
4.1.1. Grammatical word
         As defined by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:§7), a grammatical word is
identifiable as a grammatical unit between morpheme and syntactic phrase, whose
constitutents are a head plus immediate (local) dependents, in a fixed, continuous order in
terms of a given semantic value. These identification criteria are probably universal, and
are expanded on only briefly here with reference to examples (17) and (18) above.
         a) indivisibility. Independent words cannot generally interrupt the strings of
morphemes expressed in (17) and (18). 73
         b) patterning as a unit. The strings in (17) and (18) can be moved and modified
within the syntax as wholes, but no subset can.
         c) fixed order. The orders of elements in (17) and (18) are fixed. While certain
sequences of grammatically bound forms (for example, predicate derivations (§11)) are to
an extent variably-ordered in Galo, variation always results in a different meaning; i.e., a
different grammatical word.
         d) status as a syntactic unit. The strings in (17) and (18), taken as wholes, each
realize a predicate (a unit referred to by various syntactic rules, which is a constituent of
various phrase types, etc). No subset of either string in (17) and (18) can qualify as such a
syntactic unit.
         e) grammatical part-whole composition. The functional and structural descriptions
of the parts in (17) and (18) refer to the whole, and the functional and structural
description of the whole makes reference to the parts. No elemental subset of (17) or (18)
relates to another constituent at the same or a higher level.
         f) native speaker awareness of meaning and independent status. Speaking very
generally, a speaker is more likely to feel comfortable uttering and assigning meaning to a
grammatical word in isolation than to one of its subparts. For example, most speakers
sense no difficulty in uttering and assigning meaning to zabdù in (17) out-of-context,although the same cannot be said of hidù in (18). There are difficulties in applying thiscriterion, since native speakers typically experience greater difficulties in assigning
meaning to function words than to lexemes (i.e., go in would go is more easily defined orlarger than a word (Chao 1968). Some modern, linguistically-inclined Galo have coined the term gomcɨ ̀r
(lit., ‘speech pellet’) to denote sub-lexical roots and morphemes; it remains to be seen whether this usage
will become widely-accepted or not.
73
   For an important partial exception to this generalization, see §13.5.

described as a “word” than is would). Nonetheless, native speaker awareness of meaning
and independence may be employed as a supporting criterion.
         Stated simply then, a grammatical word is identifiable in being treated as a unit
by the grammar at various levels. Characteristics of phonological words will be shortly
discussed; first, it will be useful to review some of the properties of affixes and clitics.","[153, 154, 155]"
"         Thus, the picture that emerges is one in which O and E arguments are consistently
opposed both to subject functions (S and A) and to oblique functions, but are neither
consistent in their alignment nor in their opposition to one another. This scenario is
schematized in Figure 14.3.

         Figure 14.3 – Schematization of the grammatical treatment of Galo argument structures
         The question, then, is whether O and E argument types can be said to stand in a
single grammatical relation to the predicate (in some contexts at least, such as in
nominalization/relativisation), or whether they must be said to stand in different relations
(but that this difference is sometimes elided, as in nominalization/relativisation). I leave
this question open for future research. 271  270F
14.1.3.9. Additional lexical-semantic and syntactic properties of E arguments
         In addition to the verb and clause types discussed in §14.1.3.8, certain types of
                                                                          426H
complement clause might be analysed as an E argument. For example, the speech
reporting verb ә́m- ‘say (that)’ obligatorily subcategorizes for a direct speech report in
271
   The “usual suspect” approaches would be to treat the O relation as “direct object” and the E relation as
“indirect object”, or else as “primary” and “secondary” objects respectively. I do not see how either
approach would be appropriate here. First, “primary” and “secondary” object as defined by Dryer (1986)
refers to the grammatical alignment of extended transitive Recipient and transitive Patient in opposition to
extended transitive Theme – that is clearly not in evidence here. Regarding “direct” and “indirect” objects –
which refers to the consistently different grammatical treatments of O and E, O standing as “direct” object
and E as “indirect” object (and in which E may be “promoted” in some constructions to the “direct” object
relation) – I hope I have shown that this too is not obviously in evidence (although I do not doubt that a

share the same etymological marking in bə́, but which differ in terms of their internal       structures) may also be understood to realize an E argument, when their presence is
       required for a particular sense of a verb to properly obtain. For example, several senses of
       the highly polysemous verb rɨ ̀- ‘do’ clearly require an E argument, usually with aTranslative sense (S/A become E); in (870), the (ellipsed) notional subject referent is an

       appositive phrases marked E, the sentence is borderline ungrammatical, and gives a sense
       that the area is somehow being construed as an animate actor of ‘do’ (in the intransitive
       sense) (871).

arguments, despite being obligatorily present under this sense of the predicate.
        Finally, we can note cases in which certain applicative derivations to a predicate
stem add an argument to a clause which, although semantically and syntactically
obligatory, is not treated as grammatical subject or object. The most frequently and
robustly-attested such case is that of directional applicatives such as -lɨ ̀k ‘INTO’. In (872),
                                                                                         425H
the noun phrase marked E is licensed as a goal by the applicative derivation, and would
be understood as semantically entailed whether it overtly represented in the clause or not.

derivation may be referenced via Non-subject nominalization of the applicative-derived
predicate in -nam. For further discussion of applicative derivations, see §11.2.5.

14.2.   Referentiality and pragmatic marking14.2.1. Canonical patterns
        There are four basic possibilities for marking of the referential status of noun
phrases in Galo; all are mutually exclusive:
            a) zero Ø (references type)
            b) individuator go (references individual as an instance of a type)
            c) Topic marker əə (references individual as contrastive with other
               individuals)
            d) demonstrative (various) (as Topic marker, additionally providing spatial-
               deictic information)14.2.1.1. Zero-marking
        By zero-marking, I mean here presentation of a noun phrase which is unmarked
for referential status. There are somewhat different implications for zero-marking of noun                                              697
phrases in different syntactic functions, with different phrasal heads, and in different
syntactic constructions/clause types.
       Uniquely referential noun phrases (i.e., those headed by pronouns and proper
names) are almost always zero-marked in Galo when in subject function (effectively, in
Nominative case; see §6.1.2.2.8), although certain pronoun types may also be marked for
                                   425H
topicality (§14.2.1.3; see also §6.1.3). Proper name-headed noun subject noun phrases are
                    425H                  4256H
obligatorily zero-marked for referentiality and/or are supported by a following
coreferential pronoun (873). Noun phrases definitely referring to known and/or highly
                           4257H
discourse topical individuals (such as ‘my father’) may be zero-marked, but may also be
marked for topicality when in subject function (§14.2.1.3).

referential (and/or referring to a generic concept rather than a concrete individual) (874).

              In practice, inasmuch as ordering preferences do exist, they would seem to
correspond to specific construction types and/or sets of specifiable pragmatic conditions;
for example, more topical and/or animate referents tend to occur early in the clause, a fact
which often determines the relative order of O and E in particular (in an extended
transitive clause). In addition, potential interactions of clause constituents can influence
ordering; for example, since adverbials may be recursively embedded, a clause containing
two predicate-modifying adverbials must be structured to ensure that they are non-
adjacent (see §16.5). Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a full inventory of
                     291H
construction-specific ordering preferences and principles for variation as of this writing;
this problem will be addressed more comprehensively in future research.","[409, 410]"
"Although complex predicate derivations such as -kèn...-pàa ‘EASY TO DO’, beingcomposed of two discontinuous simple, monosyllabic, predicate derivations, are thus by
definition disyllabic when viewed as a lexical entry, since they are discontinuous in
realization they are monosyllabic in terms of the phonological words in which they are
realized. True polysyllabic predicate derivations, in the sense of a derivation realized by a
continuous sequence of more than one syllable, are extremely rare and have apparently
arisen as a result of relatively recent fusions of earlier monosyllables. Examples of this
type are found in §11.3.3.
                    320H
11.1.4. Concatenation of multiple predicate derivations in a single predicate stem
       As discussed in §11.1.1, predicate derivations may be bound directly to an
                                   3204H
adjective (412) or verb root (413). However they may also occur on a stem which has
          3205H                            3206H
already been expanded by another predicate derivation; (412) is such an example, in
                                                            3207H
which the Causative Valence-changing derivation -mó ‘CAUS’ follows the TerminativeAspect/aktionsart derivation -róo ‘TERM’. In (420), we find an example of three predicate
                                                    3208H
derivations occurring in direct sequence in the same predicate stem.

       ‘Let him finish drinking first, will you?’ (MN, OL23:75)       Examples like (420) are relatively rare, and may be said to represent an extreme
                           3209H
case of predicate derivation “stacking”. That is to say, although I have not seen a speaker
reject a sentence as being ungrammatical on the apparent basis that its predicate contained
too many predicate derivations, due to the often quite complex and particular semantic
content of most predicate derivations, it is often all but impossible to contrive a situation                                                   464
in which more than two or three might be used; three is the largest number of
concatenated derivations I have attested naturally, as in (420).
                                                           3210H
11.1.5. Positional variability, derivational scope, and subclassification
         Given that multiple predicate derivations may occur within a single predicate stem
(§11.1.4), it follows that their order will be either 1) free 2) fixed or 3) meaningfully
  321H
variable. The possibility of free ordering may be immediately discarded, for reasons
which will become clear in passing. The possibility of meaningful variation can be clearly
substantiated, as will be shown below. However, the question of whether there is or is not
an underlying, more or less fixed structural template into which Galo predicate derivations
“naturally” fall, and in violation of which “marked” or ungrammatical utterances may be
said to occur, is less straightforward.
         Generally speaking, all predicate dependents in Galo have leftward scope (§10.3);    321H
accordingly, only a predicate derivation which is semantically and/or functionally capable
of subsuming all leftward elements under its scope may occur on a predicate stem.
Consider the examples (416) and (422). In (416), reproduced for convenience as (421),
                         321H       3214H    3215H                                    3216H
the Result derivation -tɨ ́r ‘BREAK LENGTH’ precedes the Incipient Aspect/aktionsartderivation -tà ‘INCP’; together with the root, the resulting sense is (roughly) ‘be about tostand (on a stick, thus) breaking (it).’ The predicate derivations in this case cannot occur
in any other order, since leftward application of -tɨ ́r ‘BREAK LENGTH’ over the complexnùu-tà ‘bob.knees-INCP’ ‘be about to bob the knees’ would imply a breakage actually
resulting from an action which explicitly did not even reach inception, which is logically
nonsensical.
(421) hɨgɨ ̀m jə̂ə bərè nuutɨ ̂r tannà?

         “Who’s going to bob their knees up and down (while standing) on this (stick),
         such that it breaks?” (NyPB, LAT 138)
Similarly, in (422), Ability derivation -là(a) has leftward scope over dó-ŋám ‘eat-EXH’
               3217H
‘eat up everything’, with the overall concatenation giving the sense ‘able to eat up
everything’. Variation in the relative order of derivations here too is impossible; since the
Exhaustive derivation -ŋám ‘EXH’ explicitly references a diffuse, collectively (actually)

             ‘It was as though everyone was unable to eat up everything.’ (NyR, MDS 068)             However, in felicitous semantic circumstances (which are admittedly rare), it is
possible to vary the order of derivations; in this case, there are clear semantic contrasts
which appear to be the outcome of scope effects. Consider (423), an example which was
                                                                            3219H
constructed on the model of the naturally-attested example (420).                   320H

             imbibe-FIRST-CAUS-COLL-IPTV.SDIR=HORT.POL
             ‘Let us all drink first.’
In (423), the Causative derivation -mò causes the underlying O argument to be
      321H
understood as a nonvolitional Actor, i.e., a drinker. This in turn causes the Exhaustive
derivation -ŋám ‘EXH’ – which references a diffused O argument – reference a diffusedActor. This is quite a different meaning from that of (420), in which the Causative
                                                                      32H
derivation applies later in the string, and in which the Collective derivation thus has
immediate scope over the predicate root only. For more information on the valence-
altering properties of the Causative derivation, see §11.2.5.3. 32H
             The point to understand here is that order variation is possible under certain
circumstances, and that when it is possible, it will generally create differences in meaning
which appear principally to relate to derivational scope. For this reason, I have been
unable to date to determine any underlying structural template to which Galo predicate
derivations absolutely relate, nor have I been able to assign them to exceptionless
positional subclasses. In practice, the majority of examples in my data will agree with the
semantically-based positional template given in the first line of Figure 11.1; however, the324H
fact of (albeit limited) variability in ordering suggests that more generalized semantic206
   This difference is extremely difficult to capture in English translation, but might be understood quite
roughly as the difference between “He can eat everything” and ? “He can eat, such that everything was
affected”.

                                        Summary
       This work is the first comprehensive descriptive grammar of the Lare dialect of
Galo, a Tibeto-Burman language of the Tani branch spoken in central Arunachal Pradesh
State, in the North-East Indian Himalaya. It is based on primary data obtained from
original fieldwork conducted by the author in Galo towns and villages in Arunachal
Pradesh. In addition to description of the synchronic phonology and grammar of Lare
Galo, it contains a historical overview and preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Galo
segmental phonology, in addition to a glossary of approximately 1,300 lexical roots with
4,000 lexical exemplars and three fully analyzed texts.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"
"
           “Words” in Galo are not always easily represented. That is, although we can easily
come up with long lists of “words” in context-free elicitation (mostly nouns, adjectives,
and citation forms of simple verbs), when morphological complexity is introduced, it
often becomes extremely difficult for linguists and native speakers alike to recognize
clear and consistent word boundaries. Briefly consider the following examples (17)-(18).
(17)       zabdù
           záp-dùu
           talk-IPFV
           ‘talk’
(18)       zabrɨ ́k hidù
           záp-rɨ ́k-hí-dùu
           talk-APPL:MEET-REFL-IPFV
           ‘talking to one another’
           In (17), Imperfective -dùu is suffixed to a bound verb root záp- ‘talk’. Neither záp-nor -dùu can stand independently, nor can they stand in any other relative order. A single,uninterruptible prosodic contour occurs over zabdù, with potential pauses at either edge,with a single tone contour and constituting a single metrical foot. On the segmental level,
internal sandhi and boundary phenomena are observed (i.e. Regressive voicing
assimilation (§4.1.3.7) occurs at the word-internal syllable boundary and Final length
neutralization (§4.1.4.4) occurs at the right-edge word boundary). Native speakers readily
                                               152
attribute meaning to zabdù but are unable to easily describe the meaning or function ofeither of its parts. In short, a diverse set of criteria converge to support the notion that
zabdù is a “word”.
         Now, however, consider (18). Here again, grammatical criteria identify a single
word. No subset of the string can occur independently or in any other order, and although
native speakers can attribute meaning to the whole, they cannot easily assign meaning to
its parts. However, two distinct prosodic units can now be identified, in which two
primary stress slots are found. Assimilation sandhi occur at the border of záp- and -rɨ ́k butnot at the border of -rɨ ́k and -hí (word-internally, h surfaces [s] post-consonantally; cf.","[152, 153]"
"
2.4.3.4.1. Initial cluster simplification 2 (10)           This ordered change occurred widely in the Tani area, affecting all the Eastern
languages, though not some Western languages such as Apatani. It removed the glide
position from all obstruent-initial syllables (such as ‘steal’ and ‘ginger’ in Table 2.13).
Since nasal-glide sequences had earlier reduced to PPG *ɲ- via palatalization rules (cf.§2.4.3.3), this change effectively left PPG *rj- as the last remaining exemplar of the PPG40
     The sequences **gi, **ŋe and **ŋj- are not attested in my data. Note also that the change PTs *mj- →
PPG *ɲ- could also be understood as →*nj-, which would be formally simpler since it retains a cluster
(which is later removed following obstruents, but not sonorants). This would introduce homophonous [nj]
and [ɲ] elements in the PPG segment inventory which, while not an absolute phonological absurdity
(though it would seem to be phonetically absurd), would require expanding the modern Lare syllable canon
by one position. It is simpler to assume a global condition, not presented here in the interest of brevity (and
since it is fairly self-evident), in which [nj] sequences automatically reduce to [ɲ].
                                                     107
four-position syllable canon (PTs *lj- is unattested). The preservation of PPG *rj- (as in‘tongue’ in Table 2.13) had important consequences for the future development of Galo
dialects. Informally, *C → Ø / [-son] _.
          Note that Initial cluster simplification 2 cannot be grouped with Initial cluster
simplification 1; unlike Initial cluster simplification 1, Initial cluster simplification 2 must
be ordered after Regressive palatalization, since it created PPG *Ci and *Ce sequenceswhich would have been subject to Regressive palatalization, but were not (such as
‘ginger’ in Table 2.13).","[107, 108]"
"          It is necessary to order the changes in terms of the vowels affected, because of an
intermediate Raising change which affected some but not all of the conditions that would
have been available if the changes were uniform. In particular, *e sporadically raised to ifollowing labials, affecting, for example, both PTs *me sequences and PPG *me
41
  *-t1 and *-t2 indicate proto-forms with t reflexes in some languages, but with different reflexes in other
languages, and for which evidence is insufficient to reconstruct the precise nature of the proto-difference.
However, Sun (1993b) speculates, and I agree, that the most likely form for *-t1 is *-ɕ. For discussion of the
unusual behaviour of the modern Lare Galo *-t1 reflex, see §3.4.2.
                                                    108
sequences which were innovated through the fronting of PTs *mon terms. 42 However, itdid not affect PPG *me sequences innovated through fronting of PTs *man terms. Thus, itis necessary to order the changes as:
           1) Vowel fronting 1 (11)
           2) Labial/palatal raising (12)
           3) Vowel fronting 2 43 (13)
           Note also that the Vowel fronting changes must have occurred subsequent to
Regressive palatalization, since they created {+lab, +vel}{i, e} sequences which wouldhave been subject to Regressive palatalization, but were not.
           Broadly speaking, then, the vowel fronting changes observe the general pattern
[+back] → [-back] / _ [-back], with [+high] and [-high] specifications remaining constant;
as noted, however, this is not without complications.","[108, 109]"

   For example, *tɨ ́-kùm=əə=ree? ‘pick-GATHER=COP=PQ’ * ‘are they stacked?’, in which -kùm is
construed as an adjectivalizer licensing a copula complement, is rejected by my consultants.

11.2.1.1. Result derivations and two-part stems
           A number of Galo verb roots are preferentially – possibly obligatorily, at least for
some speakers – followed by a result derivation of some kind. Some well-attested
examples are kə̀r- ‘chop (something large, as a tree)’, cíK- ‘operate a door’, zɨ ́ɨ- ‘sink’,tók- ‘move down’, and kùm- ‘stack (objects with length/extent)’, although it is possible
that others exist. In most such cases, the motivation appears to be that the sense of the
verb root is viewed as incomplete in absence of some specified result. For example,
although it is perhaps possible to imagine operating a door in the abstract, in practice one
cannot operate a door without either opening or closing it; hence, (445) is straightforward,
                                                                        320H
but (446) has been rejected by my consultants (note, incidentally, that there is no basic
    321H
English lexeme with this sense either).
(445) cittúm toké!
           cíK-túm-tó=kée
           operate.door-CLOSED.S/O-IPTV.ODIR=HORT.POL
           ‘Close (the door)!’ (MN, OL17:61)
(446) *ŋó ərəpə́m cikká.
           ŋó əráp=əəm cíK-káa
           1.SG door=ACC operate.door-PF
           * ‘I operated the door.’
           In a similar vein, the sense of kə̀r- ‘chop (something large, such as a tree)’ isincomplete without an appropriate result derivation such as -tùu ‘IN HALF’ (compare alsoEnglish ?I’m chopping the tree, which is odd in absence of a result complement such as
down, up or into bits), and the sense of zɨ ́ɨ- ‘sink’ is incomplete without a result derivationsuch as -bùk ‘INTO SUBSTANCE’ (presumably since one cannot sink without beingsubmerged as a result).
           However, some other verb roots which require a following result derivation, such
as tók- ‘move down’ (which seems to require following result derivation -ɨ ̀ɨ ‘LOW RESULT’)seem less easily analyzable in this way, and may simply be that they are in the process of
lexicalizing as a two-part stem. In this case, in appears that tók- ‘move down’ may oncehave functioned as a general motion verb with the sense ‘descend’ (in Mising, a probably
                                                489
cognate form tok- occurs as the general ‘descend’ verb), but that this function hasobsolesced in Galo in favor of the general ‘descend’ verb ìi-. 214           213F
11.2.1.2. Purpose
            In a few cases, purpose senses may be inferred from Manner or Result derivations.
For example, Manner derivation -ɲòk has the basic sense ‘PLACATINGLY’, as in bə́ə-ɲòk‘carry/hold-PLACATINGLY’ ‘hug someone placatingly’; the latter sense could as easily be
translated ‘hug someone in order to placate them’, according to the speaker’s construal.
Similarly, the Result derivation in míK-dòr-tó ‘blow-INCREASE-PFV’ ‘blew on something(such as a fire, thus) increasing it (as its strength)’ could be as easily construed as ‘blew
on the fire in order to increase its strength’. I have not yet attested a predicate derivation
which entailed a purpose sense to the exclusion of (or in preference to) a sense of manner
or result; however, it seems likely that at least some purposive senses are preferentially
expressed by Galo speakers via the use of manner and/or result derivations.","[487, 488, 489, 490]"

11.1.6.2.3. Grammatical status of the sequence [PDER-x] 1: against an “auxiliary

composed of a verb root plus predicate derivation. What of the grammatical status of
“words” composed of two predicate derivations, or a predicate derivation plus predicate
inflection, as ladù in (425)?
                        3249H
        Here again, the situation is somewhat complex. Consultants are often comfortable
uttering “words” such as ladù in (425) in isolation, but are only rarely able to assign them

              ‘I can wash it clean.’             In all syntactic theories of which I am aware, “auxiliary verb” is treated as a
syntactic word, whether viewed as a constituent of the predicate or verb (Chomsky 1971
[1957]), predicate/verb phrase (Chomsky 1965) or sentence (Haegeman 1991). It is never,
so far as I am aware, construed as a syntactic word in some cases and an internal
constituent of another word – i.e. an affix, which would no longer be referred-to by
syntactic rules – in other cases. Among functional characterizations, Givón (2001
[1984]:§7) identifies “auxiliary verbs” as a small subset of verbs (in most languages
which have them), occupying a particular position in a specific diachronic process of
grammaticalization, viz. MAIN VERB > AUXILIARY > TAM MARKER > TAM AFFIX, and
similar (though more detailed) characterizations are given by Heine (1993). Thus,
although there is expected to be a particular point in the process when the auxiliary has
shed most of its erstwhile verbal properties and begins to be subsumed under another
syntactic word (generally, though perhaps not necessarily, the main verb), by the time it
occurs as a bound local dependent it is no longer referred-to by the term “auxiliary”; i.e.,
it is now a “TAM affix”.
             To summarize, I understand the category “auxiliary verb” to include syntactic
words which are diachronically derived from main verbs, which are undergoing specific
processes of grammaticalization, and which are (therefore, probably) expected to be few
in number. I do not understand it to indifferently include suffixes, bound formatives and
free words, nor to designate terms which have the capacity to surface sometimes as a
suffix, and sometimes as a word, and I would not expect there to be a large or
indeterminate number of auxiliary verbs in a language for which they are identified.
             Recall, then, that within a Galo predicate complex, the predicate derivation -là(a)‘ABIL’ may either occur as a phonologically and grammatically bound dependent of a verb,
as in (424), or as a phonologically unbound but, as I will maintain, grammatically bound
     325H
dependent of the same verb as in (425)/(430). Even if one were to dispute the idea of -là(a)
                                        325H     3254H
                                                         472
being grammatically bound in (425)/(430), one could not, it seems to me, dispute it in the
                                                              325H           3256H
case of (424) (since it appears to license a term which is grammatically bound, and must
                         3257H
        therefore presumably be grammatically bound itself). Thus, analysing -là(a) as an        auxiliary verb head in (425)/(430) would require us to state that Galo auxiliary verbs head
                                         3258H        3259H
        grammatically free terms in some cases, and are grammatical dependents of other terms
        in other cases. This is not theoretically impossible, perhaps, but it would, in the specific
        case of “auxiliary verbs”, amount to a radical re-conception of the meaning of this term
        and of the type of syntactic object it could represent. Worse, it would necessitate
        specifying that the motivation for the surfacing of -là(a) as a free word head as opposed to        a bound dependent is nothing more than the fact that another morpheme (in the case of
(425)/(430), the Result derivation -kák) happened to be occurring in its designated
3260H            3261H
        dependent slot. This would strike me as a syntactically sloppy and poorly-motivated
        analysis.
                         Furthermore, adopting the second analysis illustrated in (430) would necessitate
                                                                                                 326H
        positing an indefinitely large number of “auxiliary verb heads” in Galo, for the simple
        reason that any bound dependent of the predicate occurring in the third syllable position
        would then be subject to analysis as the head of an auxiliary verb. Consider the examples
        in Table 11.1.

The formal and functional identity of the bolded morphemes in Table 11.1 is self-evident,        3264H
        and the principal arguments against analyzing them in the first column as bound
        dependents and in the second column as auxiliary verb heads are, I hope, by now clear.
                 Finally, we may note that it is never possible to extract forms such as ladù in(425)/(430) or lɨɨdù or kendù in Table 11.1 from their position in the predicate complex

derivations as auxiliary verb heads, might be unconvinced that they are not in fact serial
verbs. In this analysis, (425)/(430) might be reanalysed as in (431), with V1 standing as

              ‘I can wash clothes.’                    However, arguments similar to those deployed against the auxiliary verb analysis
also apply here. First, we would have to explain why it is that serialized verb heads, as in
the second column of Table 11.1, also occur as bound formatives as in the first column.
                                        3274H
Also, we would have to explain why so many putatively serialized “verbs” (including
most terms in the second right-hand column of Table 11.1) cannot themselves stand as
                                                                      3275H
        head of a simple predicate; surely, the minimal requirement of a serial verb analysis is
        that the terms involved are in some very basic sense “verbs”, and that is not the case
        here. 210 Finally, although it is not always possible in verb-serializing languages to find
             209F
syntactic material such as adverbials, negators or (other) particles intervening in a serial
verb string (Aikhenvald 2006), it is quite common among Mainland South-East Asian
languages; for example, in the Standard Thai example (432), it is possible to insert both
                                                                              3276H
an adverbial rèw-rèw ‘quickly’ and negator mâj between the two serialized verbs, with210
   It is of course common for serial verbs to grammaticalize, and to progressively shed their basic verbal
status; a paradigm example is Mandarin Chinese 把 bǎ (Li and Thompson 1973; Post 2007). However, it is
not normally the case for the majority of putative serial verbs in a given language to lack the capacity to
independently head a predicate (or at least, I am not aware of any such description).
                                                                474

generally allowed in the Galo predicate complex (§10.1).        327H
11.1.6.2.5. Native speaker intuition            Finally, we can revisit the question of native speaker intuition. Although speakers
are often comfortable assigning a “standalone” sense to sequences of the form
[VROOT-PDER] (§11.1.6.2.1), they are less comfortable assigning standalone senses to
                       3278H
sequences of the form [PDER-x] such as ladù in (425)/(430)/(431). None of my consultants

11.1.6.2.6. Interim summary     To briefly summarize this section, we have considered evidence from native speaker
intuitions concerning the capacity for sub-predicate “words” to stand alone, and be
assigned a “standalone” meaning, concerning the capacity for sub-predicate “words” to
clearly pattern as words in the syntax, whether as terms of syntactic constituents other
than the predicate complex or as terms of movement within the predicate complex, and
concerning the morphological status of sub-predicate word “heads”, in terms of whether it
is sensible or not to analyse them sometimes as heads of free syntactic words, and
sometimes not. Overall, I conclude that while it is certain that sequences of the form
[VROOT-PDER] have grammatical “word” status in many cases, it is not possible to
generalize this status over an entire syntactic category which such sequences could be
said to realize in every case. The evidence for grammatical “word” status of sequences of
the form [PDER-x] is even weaker. Ultimately, it would appear that the only type of post-
head syntactic “word” that could be identified within the predicate complex would be one
whose head can be either a predicate derivation or a predicate inflection, which is
homophonous with and functionally identical to bound morphological dependents, and
whose only raison d’être would appear to be the fact of occurrence in third syllable
position in the predicate complex (which is, of course, a phonological rather than a
grammatical fact).
     I therefore conclude that the only complete sense in which sub-predicate words in
Galo are “words” is a phonological sense; grammatically, there is no great motivation for
considering Galo predicate derivations as anything other than bound predicate formatives.
       Precisely what kind of bound formative they may be is the topic of the next
section.","[471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476]"

11.2.5.8. Reversive -kò         Reversive -kò ‘REVS’ is perhaps one of the most intriguing morphemes in Galo,however its grammatical importance is belied by a very low text-frequency. In its basic
use, -kò ‘REVS’ functions to reverse the semantic roles of the core arguments of atransitive verb; that is to say, where A and O are (in most cases) analyzable as
Agent/Actor and Patient/Undergoer, predicate marking in -kò causes A to be understood221
   For example, the Instrumental applicative would be unlikely to occur on the predicate of the sentence I
threw the stone at the pig, but would be more likely to occur in I threw the pig at the stone.

                                              357H
rather valence-rearranging, in the sense of Dixon and Aikhenvald (2000).

In (545), the Benefactive derivation first adds the E argument (mò- ‘make’ is a transitive
  358H
root); the Reversive derivation then causes A to be understood as Beneficiary, while E is
understood as Actor. Presumably, selectivity for E is related to the greater likelihood of E
argument animacy/activity, although this remains to be fully-investigated.

the motivation for a passive. Namely, in both (544) and (545), the speaker must maintain

obligatorily occur with second person subjects (§12.4.2.5). However, the speaker wishes

at the same time to depict an event in which the subject referent – the addressee – is not
construed as an Agent. Marking in -kò thus causes the semantic role of A to be exchangedwith that of a non-subject argument, and subject referential continuity is thereby
preserved. Importantly, however, no syntactic reconfiguration is required in order for this
interpretation to take hold (hence this is not a syntactic “passive”); a semantic role
“reversal” is all that takes place.","[536, 537]"

9.1.2. Main clause subtypes         Galo main clauses are predicative or appositive. Predicative clauses consist of an
inflecting verbal or adjectival predicate head plus arguments S/A/O/E and OBL (according
to head type). Appositive clauses are headed or headless: a headed appositive clause
exhibits one of a set of uninflecting copula heads and two arguments CS and CC. Headless
appositive clauses consist of two arguments VCS and VCC, with no overt syntactic
predicator. These subtypes are described as copula clauses and verbless clauses
respectively. In (311), an appositive copula clause is followed by a predicative clause.

somewhat non-standard; in principle, a copula is a predicate, and a clause containing a
copula is (therefore) not appositive. Furthermore, an appositive clause still predicates,
despite the absence of an overt predicating form. Despite these weaknesses, the terms as
defined above were chosen for the purpose of avoiding a number of other potentially even
more confusing or misleading alternatives. 191 Figure 9.1 schematizes the classification.

   “Inflecting/finite” versus “uninflecting/appositive” was also considered; however, it should be noted that
in many dependent clause subtypes, a predicative clause is not inflected. In addition, terms like “final” or
“finite” seem to imply a sense of “completeness” which is as easily applied to an appositive clause as to a
predicative clause.

of predicate-bound suffixes with specific clause-linking functions; they are best analysed
on a case-by-case basis. All dependent clause types not based on nominalizations are
discussed in §16. Most clause types based on nominalizations are discussed in §15.

Note that Intervocalic glide deletion must be ordered after Palatal frontingand raising, since Palatal fronting and raising (both varieties) creates [ji] and [je]sequences which are subject to Intervocalic glide deletion.

glide deletion occurs at the word level rather than at the syllable level (Table 2.26).","[116, 117]"

5.3.1. Word structure 1: Nouns and adjectives
        The structure of Galo nouns and adjectives is primarily based upon two types of
template. Both are essentially two-part templates, where each “part” may be, in principle,
an affix, root, or word (according to the subtype).
        The templates are further structured in two ways: they may be symmetrical or
asymmetrical. In an asymmetrical template, the two formatives do not have the same
status. In this case, the first term is always relatively generic, and invokes a relatively
broad semantic type, while the second term has a more specific sense, narrowing the
denotation to a particular exemplar or quality of the type. In a symmetrical template, the
two terms are balanced with respect to semantic generality, and may each be (arbitrarily)
described as “specific” (Figure 5.10).

two types, with examples found among prefixed roots, root-root compounds, and two-

and below might not be more straightforwardly described in terms of “Modifier-
Modified”, “Head-Modifier”, or “Head-Dependent” relations, concepts which are perhaps
more commonly employed in the analysis of linear ordering relations in language.
However, it would appear that the prefixes in (87)-(88) “modify” or “depend” on the
                                                     243H   24H
following root at the same time as the second, more adjectival or descriptive formatives in
(89)-(90) “modify” or “depend” on the first. Thus, the “order of modification” in Galo
245H   246H
word-internal structure, to the extent that it exists, would appear mixed: there are both H-
MOD and MOD-H types.
              An alternative view, and the view taken in this work, is that a general concept of
“modification” is basically inapplicable to Galo word-formation, and that the relevant
concept is in fact “classification” (in the sense of a Type-Exemplar/Quality or, as it has
been described here, a Generic-Specific type of patterning). A more complete discussion
of this phenomenon in the Tani languages will be found in (Post in preparation-a).
              Symmetrical ordering is primarily found among two-term compounds such as in

5.3.1.1. Prefixed roots
               A large number of basic nouns and adjectives in Galo have the internal structure
[PFX-ROOT]. Although such patterns are largely unproductive in modern Galo, due to a
probable earlier high productivity there are large numbers of exemplars in the lexicon, as
well as some vestiges of productivity in certain semantic domains. Prefixes have no status
as underlying TBUs in Galo, meaning that the surface tone of a noun or adjective
composed of a prefixed root will always be a direct reflex of the underlying tone of that
root (§4.1.4.2).
        250H
5.3.1.1.1. a- prefix
               A very large percentage of basic nouns and adjectives have initial a- or a shortvowel of another quality Vα-, both of which may be traced to an earlier prefix PTs *a-(ultimately probably < PTB non-pronominal *a- (Lehman 1975)).

nearby Minyong and Mising as people who “add -ng” to words in which it should not
occur. Although some syllable-final engmas have been secondarily reintroduced into Galo
(particularly in the Pugo dialect) via word-internal assimilation processes, no word-
final -ŋ codas have been observed among native Galo lexemes, and neither would thereseem to be any signs of secondary reintroduction word-finally.
         In this change, syllable-final -ŋ was deleted, leaving a compensatorily lengthenedvowel in its stead; schematically: -Viŋ → -ViVi.

15.2.2. Etymology and relationships to other form-classes
         Most of the Secondary nominalizers found to date have probable cognates
elsewhere in the language, mostly among Manner, Result or Directional predicate
derivations (§11.2.1-§11.2.2), and/or among (other) sub-lexical roots; for example, -zèn
                 4509H     4510H
‘NZR:PARTNER’ as in tɨ ́ɨ-zèn ‘imbibe-NZR:PARTNER’ ‘drinking buddy’ almost certainlyreflects the sub-lexical root zèn- as in azèn ‘friend’. Similarly, -rə́p ‘NZR:ITERATION’ as in
281
   Unless, as one consultant tells me, one sleeps with such force and intensity that by the end of the night,
the bed has been partly eroded-away; jùp-túu could then be used to denote the bed.
                                                     755
ín-rə́p ‘go-NZR:ITERATION’ ‘trip’ probably relates to the Predicate derivation -rə́p‘INCEPTIVE’ as in ín-rə́p-dùu ‘go-ICEP-IPFV’ ‘starting to go’. Accordingly, Secondarynominalizers are analysed in this work as a subclass of predicate derivations; the
semantics and co-occurrence possibilities of the individual forms are thus discussed and
exemplified in the broader context of predicate derivations in §11.2.4.1. Like other    451H
predicate derivations, Secondary nominalizers present challenges with respect to their
lexical vs. functional (or “root” versus “suffixal”) status (see §11.1.7 for additional
                                                                                4512H
discussion). Given their frequent semantic complexity, it is very likely that most if not all
Secondary nominalizers will be reconstructible as proto-lexemes, whether at the Proto-
Tani stage or some other; however, due to scarcity of comparative data, very few
reconstructions are actually possible at this point.
            Primary nominalizers are even more difficult to etymologize. The most important
Primary nominalizers -nà ‘NZR:SUB’ and -nam ‘NZR:RLS/NSUB’ seem likely to reconstructin some form to Proto-Tani, although some inconsistencies in the comparative data make
it difficult both to reconstruct their proto-functions and (in turn) to determine whether or
not they were synchronically relatable at the PT stage. 282 Ultimately, it seems possible
                                                                      281F
that PT *nam could reflect *na ‘General nominalizer’ + *m ‘Object marker’, althoughsegmental and tonal reflexes in Galo and Apatani don’t unreservedly support this
hypothesis. 283 Even more speculatively, it may be that ‘General nominalizer’ *na – if it
                28F
existed – derived from an earlier free form *na ‘Article (?)’, which gave rise separately toboth nominalizing and non-nominalizing functions. Support for this view would come
282
      The main difficulty surrounds the fact that the regular Apatani reflex of PT *nam is in either nĩ or nɨ;̃
while *na is reflected in ni or nɨ. Unfortunately, however, the available sources are wildly inconsistent both
in transcription of vowel nasalization and in distinction of i/ɨ. For example, in Abraham (1985: 118) we find
a form anɨ ̃ ‘coming’, which would regularly reflect PT *vaŋnam ‘coming’ – so far so good – however, in
many other places in the same volume we find phrases such as móka akunɨ ‘his coming’ (without
nasalization over the vowel ɨ). Accordingly, since is possible in the Apatani sources to find agentive,
patientive and action nominalizations in -nɨ, it is impossible at present to discern whether this reflects the
existence of a general nominalizing function to -nɨ in Apatani – possibly reflecting a single proto-form *na,
with *na-m presumably a post-Proto-Tani composition – or whether this may simply be the result of
multiple errors or inconsistencies in transcription of the data.
283
    Put simply, Galo tonal reflexes are wrong (if -nà is internal to -nam, then -nam should also be low, but it
is not), and the Apatani accusative marker and action nominalizer don’t regularly correspond. Either of
these facts could be explained in terms of irregularities related to grammaticalization and subsequent
phonological erosion, but additional evidence should nevertheless be sought prior to advancing this
etymology in any serious way. Note that if it can indeed be supported, then this etymology would also
suggest a diachronic precedence to the Non-subject (or Object) nominalizing function over the Event/action
nominalizing function.

15.3.   Nominalization-based constructions
15.3.1. Nominalized clauses
15.3.1.1. Overview
        Nominalized clauses, relative clauses and nominal complement clauses are based
on the same set of morphological processes and syntactic structures in Galo; in what
follows, this overall construction will be referred-to as a “nominalized clause” for short,
with references made to subtypes as required.
        The core of a nominalized clause is a predicate nominalization via suffixation of a
Primary or Secondary nominalizer to an uninflected predicate stem, as ín-nam ‘go-NZR:RLS’ ‘to go; the action of going’ or ín-dín ‘go-NZR:REASON’ ‘reason for going’. Anominalized clause minimally consists of a single nominalized predicate, but may also
include several additional constituents. Nominalized clause constituents generally
resemble main clause constituents in terms of syntax and constituent structure/marking,284
    Although regular cross-language correspondences have not yet been determined, it is perhaps worth
noting some potential cognates in the Athpare article/singular nominalizer -na (Ebert 1997; Bickel 1999)
(note however that DeLancey (2002) suggests that this form has a language-internal etymology), the Kham
General nominalizer -ɲa (Watters 2002: 199), and/or the Mongsen Ao ‘Agentive case’ marker nə (Coupe
2007).
285
    Grammaticalization effects are in this case highly unlikely (since proto-high would not be expected to
attain the more marked low realization in the course of grammaticalization); thus, it is perhaps more
plausible that -kò and kó- could reflect a much older derivation-based alternation; cf. §2.4.2.5.
286
   The only potential non-Tani cognate I have yet found is in Athpare General nominalizer -(k)ha(k)
(Bickel 1999), although the chances of such a good segmental correspondence at such a great genetic depth
seem small. Lhasa Tibetan sa (Mazaudon 1978) seems like a segmentally plausible relation, but may be
semantically doubtful.
                                                   757
with the important exception that subjects are obligatorily marked in the Genitive, as ŋó-kə̀ tolò ín-nam ‘1.SG-GEN DST.LOC.UP go-NZR:RLS’ ‘my going/having gone up there’ orŋó-kə̀ tolò ín-dín ‘1.SG-GEN DST.LOC.UP go-NZR:REASON’ ‘my reason for going up there’.
Genitive marking is not a property of main clause subjects in Galo. 287        286F
        Nominalized clauses can be subdivided into gapped and full subtypes.
Gapped nominalized clauses contain a syntactic zero (Ø) or “gap”, representing an
ellipsed underlying constituent which is coreferential with the nominalized predicate.
Gapped nominalized clauses may stand alone as an argument noun phrase head, or they
may be pre-posed to a noun phrase head as an adnominal modifier; in the latter case, the
“gap”, the nominalized predicate, and the modified noun phrase head are all
simultaneously coreferential. Gapped nominalized clauses which stand alone as an
argument noun phrase head are usually referred to in the literature as headless relative
clauses (996), while those which function as pre-posed modifiers are also called
         451H
externally-headed relative clauses (997). It is also possible for a nominalized clause to be
                                         4516H
postposed to a coreferential head. Such constructions are often identified as internally-
headed relative clauses in the literature on Sino-Tibetan nominalization (for example
Bickel (1999)), although they are also described as postposed appositives (as in DeLancey
(2002)). With respect to Galo at least, there is potential support for both interpretations;
both possible analyses are given in (998); additional discussion will be found in
                                                 4517H

   Note also that genitive subject-marking in Galo nominalized clauses is not a manifestation of dependent
clause ergativity, since genitive subject-marking is an S/A property – not an S/O or A property. For
additional discussion, see §14.3.6.1.

tú-nà                         kick-NZR:SUB        ‘kicker; person who kicked/kicks (something)’hí-nà                         die-NZR:SUB         ‘dier; person who died/dies’ahòo-nà                       long/tall-NZR:SUB   ‘tall/long one; one who is/was tall/long’               Subject nominalized clauses in -nà ‘NZR:SUB’ may stand alone (headless relative        clause) (1005) or they may be preposed to a distinct noun phrase head (externally-headed
               453H
        relative clause) (1006) (postposed/internally-headed subject nominalizations will be
                              453H
discussed shortly). In either case, the subject nominalized clause contains a syntactic gap
which is coreferential with the nominalized predicate, as well as with the external noun
phrase head (if present).

precede it. Typically, referential and relational marking of non-subject constituents of a

nominalized clause in (1007), while adverbials occur within the nominalized clause in

precede the head as in (1006), but they may also follow it. Such constructions are often
                         4539H
described as internally-headed relative clauses (Bickel 1999), or else as post-head
appositives (DeLancey 2002). In example (1009), note that ərtàk ‘bamboo fragment’ is
                                              450H
the head of the construction, and yet appears to occur in the canonical S argument
position with respect to the nominalized adjectival predicate in kaí ‘big’ (i.e., it fills thesyntactic “gap”). Note also that, unlike in an event (action) nominalized clause, no
distinct head noun may intervene between the nominalized predicate and the
demonstrative (i.e., it cannot form a nominal complement construction, unlike a
nominalized clause in -nam ‘NZR:RLS’; cf. §15.3.1.2.2).

                     At the same time, the subject of an internally-headed relative clause such as ərtàkin (1009) does not behave like other nominalized clause arguments. Namely, while other
       452H
arguments of a subject nominalization are phrasal, and have the potential to take phrasal
enclitics (such as the Accusative marker əəm in (1007) and Adverbializer bə́ in (1008)),
                                                                    453H                                         45H
internal heads of a subject nominalization cannot take phrasal enclitics (such as Topic-
marking in əə or Indviduation in go); this restriction renders the internal head of aninternally-headed subject relative clause unlike all true Galo main clause subjects (cf.
§14.2.1). Thus, although I do not wish to discount the internal head analysis completely,
 45H
unless the restricted marking of the “internal head” can be independently explained, it
would seem that a potentially preferable alternative would be to treat a noun such as ərtàk‘bamboo fragment’ in (1009) not as “internal” to the relative clause, but rather as the
                                    456H
surface head of the higher NP itself. Under this analysis, the subject nominalization would
be viewed as a noun phrase-internal post-head modifier, and it would be left to identify
two subtypes of externally-headed relative clause, pre-posed and post-posed. 290                   289F
                     Postposition of subject nominalizations to a noun phrase head is common when
the nominalized clause predicate is intransitive as in (1009); however, when the
                                                                           457H
nominalized clause predicate is transitive, potential ambiguities are created. That is,
although it is possible for the O argument of a subject nominalization to be case-marked
as in (1007), it is more commonly unmarked. 291 In the latter case, it may be difficult to
              458H                                           290F
distinguish an unmarked O argument from the nominalized clause head. In (1010),             459H
analysis 1. gives an “O argument” reading, while analysis 2. gives an “internal head”
reading.

    The same argument would lead to questioning of the “appositive” analysis, inasmuch as true appositives
should, in principle, independently refer, and (therefore) take independent referential marking – despite
their being ultimately coreferential. For discussion of noun phrase apposition in Galo, see §6.3.

   This is not a problem in the case of subject nominalizations, because the subject is either ellipsed or an
unmarked “internal” head, nor in the case of event nominalizations, seemingly because events are not as
easily construed as possessed. The ambiguity may exist in locative/oblique nominalizations, although it has
not been robustly-attested due again to the difficulty of construing many locative/oblique semantic types as
possessed. The prominence of this potential ambiguity among non-subject nominalizations can perhaps then
be explained by the ready ability for non-subject nominalizations to denote concrete, possessible entitities.

"               Due to historical harmonization processes, it is sometimes extremely difficult to
discern the correct etymology. For example, does okò ‘broadleafed nonwoody shrub’
112
    It may be that lexicalization of vowel harmony in some words but not others was in part motivated by
the need to preserve lexical contrasts in the face of ongoing syllable erosion, although this is difficult to
prove. No perfect predictor of the lexicalization of vowel harmony has yet been discovered, however it is
somewhat more frequently attested among terms denoting cultural artifacts and objects of the natural world,
in that order. Very little can be said beyond this for the present.
                                                    262
reflect pre-Lare *a- + *kò- ‘broadleafed nonwoody shrub’ (with root-nuclearharmonization of the initial prefix)? Or is it a compound ó- ‘vegetable’ + kò- ‘ibid.’? On alanguage-internal basis alone, it is probably impossible to determine with any certainty. 113                12F
            Additionally, it appears that in some cases reanalysis of a vowel-harmonized
prefix as a root may have occurred. Compare opòo, ‘liquor’ with odáa ‘prime liquor (fromfirst filtration)’. opòo almost certainly reflects PTs *a- + *poŋ ‘liquor’ (cf. Minyong,Mising, and Padam apoŋ ‘liquor’), followed by root-nuclear harmonization at or beforethe PG stage. Then what is the composition of odáa? The second element dáa- is a rootmeaning ‘big; first; fast’ (cf. cəədáa ‘thumb finger’ (< cə́ə- ‘finger; extension; protrusion’+ dáa- ‘big; first; fast’)); the sense of ‘liquor’ therefore seems to derive from a reanalysisof post-vowel-harmony prefixal o- as a root ó- ‘liquor’ (cf. also the apparentlysynonymous form poodàa ‘prime liquor’). While not altogether common, other cases ofprefix-reanalysis may be found. 114        13F
            Terms exhibiting true reflexes of PT *a- are typically “core vocabulary” items,denoting basic, common, familiar and frequently referred-to terms from among the
semantic fields presented in Table 5.29.
                                     25H
113
      The fact the okò leaves are not, in general, eaten (more often, they are used to wrap food in and/or used
as plates), but terms bearing the initial compound element ó- ‘vegetable’ usually are eaten suggests that the
prefixal etymology is the more likely. However, this evidence is not overwhelming.
114
    E.g. hocùu ‘mithun calf’, from reanalysis of prefixal ho- ‘animal prefix’ in hobə́ ‘mithun’ plus cùu-
‘infant’. The logic behind this reanalysis would seem to entail a view of mithuns as prototypical higher
animals – something quite robustly evidenced by their critical importance to Galo traditional culture.

           It is difficult to reconstruct the proto-function of *a-, in Tani as in Tibeto-Burmanmore generally. As a prefix to nominal roots, it may have been related to individuation.
Modern reflections of this possible proto-function are found among classifiers (§8.2.2),      253H
which are productively prefixed in a- – not by vowel-harmonized forms – and inherentlydenote an individual (not a generic concept).
           It is also possible that some if not all a- prefixed adjectives represent earlierderivations from – possibly, nominalizations of – basic verb roots. For example, adɨ ́k‘irritating’ has verb root counterpart dɨ ́k- ‘irritate’, from which it is very probablyhistorically derived. In Meithei, a (not very closely) related Tibeto-Burman language
spoken in nearby Manipur, precisely such a derivation is found; Meithei adjectives, which
are reported not to occur as a major non-derived lexical class, are instead derived
synchronically via prefixation of verb roots with a morpheme ə- ‘Attributive’, a possiblecognate of PTs *a- (Chelliah 1997:86).","[262, 263, 264]"

16.5.4.4. Quasi-S complement of rɨ-̀ ‘do’
          In a use seemingly limited to occurrence with two particular senses of S=A
ambitransitive verb rɨ ̀- ‘do’ – but with very high overall text-frequency and functionalvalue – a clausal subordination in bə́ occurs as a “quasi-complement” of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ in S or Efunction. The relevant senses of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ in this case are ‘happen; be the case’ (as in əmbə̀rɨ ̀-káa ‘ANAP.PADV do-PF’ ‘it happened like that’) and ‘do (in the British sense); be allright/passable; be required’ (as in agóm=əə rɨ ̀-dùu ‘speech=TOP do-IPFV’ ‘the sentence is(grammatically) correct/passable’). Clausal subordination in bə́ to rɨ ̀- ‘do’ is a “quasi-complement” in the sense that it is difficult to show that the subordinated clause is filling
a verb-subcategorized complement slot per se, and is not simply occurring as a non-
subcategorized adjunct. For example, in (1142), it is conceivable that ‘deer’ is in fact the
                                           485H
syntactic subject of ‘do’, with the clausal subordination occurring as an adjunct. Similarly,
in (1143) it is conceivable that the S of ‘do’ is something like a second person pronoun, or
  4856H
else a noun ‘person’.","[828, 829, 830, 831]"

1. Introduction1.1. Overview
         The following work is a descriptive grammar of the Lare dialect of Galo, 1 a
language of the Tani branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family which is spoken in
central Arunachal Pradesh state, North-East India. It is the first ever attempt at a
comprehensive description of the grammar of Galo, or, for that matter, of any Tani
language. It is designed to serve three main purposes. First, it is designed to serve as a
partial historical record of the Galo language as it was spoken in the early 21st century.
For reasons that will be discussed, no extant document yet comes close to serving this
purpose. Second, it is designed to serve as a reference for linguists, anthropologists, and
other scholars engaged in comparative language typology, or with other interests in
languages and cultures of the region. Third, and perhaps most importantly, it is designed
to serve as a foundation from which further descriptive, documentary and pedagogical
materials may be developed to aid in the preservation and maintenance of the Galo
language, for the benefit of future generations of Galo people.
         Although the primary focus in this work will fall consistently on the Lare dialect
of Galo, in light of the extreme paucity of documentary and descriptive materials for Tani
languages in general, references will be made to certain other Galo dialects and certain
other Tani languages where possible and relevant to the discussion; this is as much in aid
of situating Lare Galo in typological relation to its relatives and neighbours as it will be –
I hope – in aid of furthering broader linguistic studies in this extremely interesting and
very much neglected area of the linguistic world.
         In this chapter, the following subsections provide a contextual overview of Galo
language and culture (§1.2), followed by a review of relevant works by other scholars
(§1.3), a discussion of the theoretical framework in terms of which this study is conducted
(§1.4) and a description of my fieldwork and analytical methodologies (§1.5). §1.6 and
§1.7 finally discuss conventions and the structure of this work in more detail.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

   For example, both Ao Naga (Coupe 2007) and Meithei (Chelliah 1997) – being the currently best-
described of North-East Indian Tibeto-Burman languages – appear to make strong use of semantically-
oriented marking, and neither language is claimed by the cited authors to have developed grammatical
relations at all. Similar phenomena have been identified in other more-or-less Burma-bordering languages,
such as Singpho (Morey forthcoming).

14.1.3. Grammatical relations
               In Galo, we find fairly robust evidence for the grammaticalization of “subject”, in
the standard sense of S/A alignment in opposition to other core argument roles. 265              264F
Independent evidence for the grammatical relation “object” is less robust, due mainly to
differences in the extent to which E arguments align with or are distinct from O
arguments when considered from various grammatical perspectives. The following
subsections §14.1.3.1-§14.1.3.7 review areas of Galo grammar in which the grammatical
                     4198H           419H
relation of subject is manifest and/or recognizable, as well as some in which grammatical
relations might perhaps be expected to be reflected, but seem not to be. In them, I
informally refer to O as constituting an “object” relation in opposition to “subject”.
§14.1.3.8 then discusses grammatical treatment of O and E arguments in more detail,
 420H
addressing the question of whether one or more independently-identifiable “object”
relations may be said to exist in Galo, or not.
               Before proceeding, it may have been noted that at various points in this grammar,
mention has been made of grammatical features which seemingly reference S and O, but
not A (as with certain Result predicate derivations; see §11.2), as well as O and obliques,
                                                                 4201H
and sometimes S, but not A (as with predicate-collocated nominals and/or “incorporation”;
see §5.3.2.1 and §14.2.2.2). Such groupings seem not to be describable as “grammatical
        420H                 4203H
relations” (interesting though they are on their own terms), inasmuch as they do not
interact with basic techniques in the language for determining the relationship of main
clause arguments to a predicate; accordingly, such groupings will not be mentioned
further in what follows.","[685, 686]"

1.7. Structure and organization       This work is divided into seventeen major chapters, with 8 appendices. Following
this introductory chapter, §2 is a historical overview, and treats the evolution of Galo
morphology and (mainly) phonology from Proto-Tani, to Proto-Galo, to the present
dialects. §3 and §4 discuss aspects of modern Lare Galo synchronic phonology, from
segmental/syllabic and word/phrasal perspectives respectively. §5 turns to the Galo
lexicon, discussing the semantic and structural features of the major word classes. §6-§8
treat aspects of the noun phrase; §6 reviews noun phrase structure, and includes
description of noun phrase constituents and their behaviour, as well as phrasal functions
such as noun phrase coordination and apposition. §7 presents a more detailed overview of
pro-forms and (other) shifters, including personal, reflexive and interrogative pronouns,
and demonstratives. §8 reviews post-head nominal modifiers, including relator nouns,
numerals, classifiers and qualifying nouns.
       §9 turns to the clause, and discusses clause types and their internal structure. §10-
§12 treat aspects of the predicate complex; §10 discusses possible predicate structures,
and §11 and §12 discuss predicate derivations and inflections respectively. §13 discusses
particles at the phrasal and clausal level, and rounds off the discussion of basic clause
structure and clause constituents. §14 turns to grammatical, semantic and pragmatic
functions of the noun phrase, including relational and pragmatic marking and marking
variations, and also reviews the evidence for grammaticalization of high-level syntactic
functions such as “subject” and “object” in Galo. §15 and §16 each discuss complex
constructions; while §15 focuses on nominalization-based constructions, including
nominalized/relative clauses and clausal nominalizations, §16 turns to multi-clause
constructions which are not based on synchronic nominalizations, including complex
predicates and clause chains, adverbial subordination and complementation. §17 is a
postscript regarding the future of the Galo language.
       Appendix A contains a list of approximately 1,400 Galo roots, together with a set
of approximately 4,000 contexts (lexemes and other morphemes) in which they are
instantiated in modern Lare Galo, as well as Proto-Tani reconstructions (where available).
Appendix B contains a posited set of regular Proto-Tibeto-Burman – Proto-Tani – Proto-
Galo – Lare and Pugo Galo segmental correspondences, centred around the Proto-Tani
reconstruction of Sun (1993b). Appendix C contains a change table proving the set of
rules posited in §2.4 to have occurred between Proto-Tani and modern Lare Galo, using a
sample set of 43 illustrative lexemes. Appendices D-G present a description of the text

"Note that this change must be ordered after Rhotic-adjacent backing (§2.4.4.4), since
Rhotic-adjacent backing innovated -ɨ rhymes in Lare which were subject to Finalweakening (e.g. ‘wind’ in Table 2.24 above). Note also the importance of “word”, rather

sense is ‘cotton.’

than “syllable”, in this change, in that word-initial syllables such as the ‘snake’ root bɨ- inbɨrə́m ‘python’ are unaffected (Table 2.25).
        In some dialects, including the variety of Lare under description here, a possibly
associated change is *u → o, which is often then reduced to ə (and from ə, sometimes toØ) via a synchronically active weakening/syncope rule (cf. §4.1.4.5). It may be possibleto view the entire set of changes as part of an overall chain of word-final vowel shifts and
reductions which may be more or less active at any given point in a given dialect’s history,
as u(> o)/o/a/ɨ > ə > Ø.","[115, 116]"

2.4.3. Proto-Tani to Proto-Galo
        The following subsections discuss phonological changes from Proto-Tani to
Proto-Galo. In them, changes are described as “ordered” or “unordered”. “Ordered”, in
this sense, indicates changes for which either language-internal or cross-language
evidence for ordering exists. “Unordered” indicates changes for which no particular
ordering must be posited on language-internal grounds, and for which cross-language
evidence for ordering has not yet been adduced. It is of course possible and likely that
additional comparative Tani research will motivate an ordering which is different from
the more or less arbitrary order of presentation in which “unordered” changes are shown
here.
        Following the title of each section, a numeral appears in (parentheses) which
refers to the numeral assigned to each change in the change table of Appendix C.","[100, 101, 102]"

1.2.10.1.5. Clause types and clause structure        Clauses are either main (independent) or dependent. Main clauses are predicative
or appositive. Dependent clause types are all based on predicative clauses. Appositive                                              55
clauses cannot be subordinated or otherwise made to depend on another clause, and do
not in general host dependent clauses within their structure.
       A main predicative clause obligatorily consists of a predicate plus its arguments,
and may also include one or more oblique noun phrases, adverbials, and/or syntactically
embedded dependent clauses. Noun phrase arguments may be followed by “Referential
qualifying expressions”, which are appositive phrasal modifiers with the same argument
function as the modified NP (i.e., a Referential qualifying expression which follows an
Accusative-marked O NP will also be Accusative-marked). Predicate arguments may be
freely ellipsed if pragmatically recoverable, but are always logically/underlyingly present.
Transitivity is a robust feature of the Galo predicate, and is projected by the inherent,
lexically-specified transitivity of the verbal or adjectival predicate head, following any
alterations to basic transitivity made by one or more valence-rearranging/altering
predicate derivations. Most predicate arguments are noun phrases, although a small
number of clause complement-taking predicate types are also found, usually with non-
prototypical constructional properties.
       Appositive clauses are either verbless clauses, or copula clauses. Both types
structurally consist of an equative or attributive apposition of two core arguments; while
verbless clauses lack an obligatory predicating element, copula clauses are obligatorily
headed by one of two uninflecting, non-verbal copulas (imperfective and perfective). In
addition, while verbless clauses take only noun phrase arguments, in a copula clause the
focal argument (Copula Complement) may be headed either by a nominal or by an
adjectival.
       Dependent clause types include non-final clauses (=medial, co-subordinate),
temporally/episodically-subordinated clauses, adverbially-subordinated clauses,
complement clauses, and nominalized clauses:
       Non-final clauses form clause chains, and often consist of large numbers of non-
recursively-embedded, non-final-marked clauses, followed by a single final clause.
Normally, each clause of a clause chain denotes an independent event, with the overall
chain usually denoting a thematically-connected chain of events in a narrative or
procedural description. The final clause is obligatorily headed by a final (inflected)
predicate, while inflection of non-final clause heads is relatively limited. There is no
grammaticalized subject-continuity constraint in Galo clause-chains, although same-
subject and switch-subject constructions are available for use in contexts of high
referential density. Complex predicates are formed using the same basic structure as a
clause chain, but exhibit more tightly-restricted constructional properties, and are (in                                             56
some if not all cases clearly) monoclausal. Subjects of clause chains are zero-marked
(Nominative).
       Temporally/episodically-subordinated clauses consist of final, inflected
predicative clauses in non-perfective aspects only (including irrealis), which are
individually (non-recursively, non-continuously) subordinated to a main predicative
clause via one of a variety of postpositions. Temporally/episodically-subordinated clauses
usually give contextual information (such as temporal or hypothetical content), and are
often marked by the same types of postposition that would mark a semantically-relatable
nominal (such as a time noun) in the same syntactic position. Subjects of most types of
temporally/episodically-subordinated clauses are Genitive.
       Adverbially-subordinated clauses are recursively embedded in a main clause, and
consist of several subtypes with different types of head, different preferred syntactic
positions, and different subordinate/main clause coreferentiality constraints. Generally
speaking, subordinate clause subjects which are syntactically ellipsed tend strongly to be
coreferential with main clause subjects, particularly when the subordinate clause follows
the higher clause subject in the surface syntax (i.e., when it is “surface embedded”).
However, subordinate/main clause subject-coferentiality may be overridden either by
overt subject use (with subordinate clause subjects once again in the Genitive) or via
“disjunct” cross-clause coreference-constraining marking, or both.
       Complement clauses are clearly identifiable as a structural type or types, but are
relatively less important than other dependent clause types in the overall organization of
Galo grammar. “Direct contents” complement clauses of cognition and locution are not
overtly marked for dependency, but are identifiable in terms of the structure of the overall
clause in which they appear. Modal complements of purpose and intention are marked by
a complementizing predicate suffix.
       Nominalized clauses are rich in Galo as in most Tibeto-Burman languages, and
exhibit the usual TB nominalization-relativization syncretism. Four “primary”
nominalization/relativization types are found, some of which are polyfunctional: 1)
Subject 2) Realis event (action)/Non-subject 3) Irrealis event (action)/Non-subject 4)
Locative/Oblique. Each may occur in headless, externally-headed and internally-headed
relative clause types, although the internally-headed type exhibits certain structural
restrictions (on all four nominalization types). Relativization may be on any major main
clause constituent, including all core arguments and most types of oblique; relativization
on phrase-internal constituents (such as possessors) is not generally possible. In addition
to primary nominalizations/relativizations, a wide variety of “secondary” nominalizers                                             57
exist which form nominalizations/relativizations on concepts such as “time when pred”,
“manner of pred” and “partner in pred”. Secondary nominalizations/relativizations
participate in most, though not all, of the constructions available to primary
nominalizations/relativizations. Nominalized clause subjects are always in the Genitive.
       In addition to basic nominalizing/relativizing functions, primary nominalizations
(not secondary nominalizations) may also occur in clausal nominalizations. In clausal
nominalizations, which may be final, backgrounding, or framing (=recapitulative, head-
tail linking), the nominalization is not relativized from any constituent, but instead stands
alone in a main-clause-like structure and function, with an unmarked (Nominative)
subject, and with its predicate potentially inflected. Clausal nominalizations generally
convey a reified, fact-like information status value, and in some uses also interact with
“conjunct/disjunct” subject person-sensitive aspect-marking.","[55, 56, 57, 58]"

14.3.6.1. Basic genitive functions
              The Galo genitive in gә (with pronominal suffixal allomorph -kә̀280) has the     279F
      primary function of marking noun phrase-internal nominal subordination (§6.1.2.2.3).            41H
The semantic content of a nominal subordination may be of possession (963), attribution  42H
(964), and/or similar/related functions.

              The genitive in gә/-kә̀ also marks the subject of a nominalized clause, and      therefore the subjects of relative clauses and nominal complement clauses (which are
      nominalization-based). Only a single example is given here; for full discussion of
      nominalized clauses, see §15.3.1 (965).

(§16.4.3.1), as well as of verbal (uninflected, predicate stem-based) adverbial

       ‘When he comes down, make (him) some tea (lit., ‘On his coming down, make
       some tea).’ (ZR, OLC2:10)       The question might be raised of whether genitive marking in Galo
nominalized/subordinated clauses is analyzable as dependent clause ergative marking (on
the one hand) or as passive/oblique subject marking (on the other). Although both of these
possible analyses are worth taking seriously, I reject both of them in the context of
modern Lare Galo, for the following reasons:
       Regarding the ergativity analysis, we should first be reminded that ergativity
refers to the fully grammaticalized alignment of S/O as opposed to A in all applicable
conditions (i.e., all possible configurations within a particular subdomain of the grammar
– say, of a particular subordinate clause type – or possibly in the grammar taken as a
whole). However, dependent clause genitive marking is in fact a subject (S/A) function in
Galo. It is sometimes not easy to see this, since some argument types may not be
representable in some conditions; for example, subject nominalizations contain an
obligatory, nominalized predicate-coreferential gap, meaning that genitive marking of
subjects is usually only witnessed in the context of object nominalizations (in which A is
marked in the genitive, in opposition to O). However, oblique nominalizations, in which S
may be represented, make the case for genitive marking as a subject property plain:
compare (965), in which a transitive object nominalization exhibits genitive subject
         49H
marking, with (967), in which an intransitive locative nominalization also exhibits subject
               450H
genitive marking.

       ‘There’s a place (there) where barking deer live.’ (IR, B8:42)       Regarding the passive/oblique subject analysis, although it might be argued that
object relatives such as in (965) background the actor, they only do so inasmuch as the
                           451H
entire event is backgrounded through expression as a relative clause. There is no
                                            740
construction in Galo which permits the notional actor of a simple main clause to be
expressed as oblique, hence, I argue, no true syntactic passive in Galo (see also §14.1.3.7).
                                                                                     452H
       Then, if all this is true, why are many types of Galo dependent clause subjects
marked in the genitive? It seems to me that this occurs for one ultimate reason and one
only: because the subject is opposed in these functions to a nominalized predicate
(whether currently or at some earlier stage of the language), and genitive marking is the
normal way of establishing a subordinate relation between one nominal and another in
Galo. Genitive subject-marking may subsequently be assigned the functional value of
disambiguating the lower clause subject from the higher clause subject; or, on the other
hand, it may simply be retained as an inherited feature of the construction, with no direct
functional value at all. Although a full investigation exceeds the scope of this work, I
would suggest that much might be learned from a future study which addresses this
question.","[738, 739, 740, 741]"

5. Word classes and word-formation processes         This chapter discusses properties of the Galo lexicon, focusing primarily on the
major open classes noun, adjective and verb. §5.1 presents a summary overview of word
structure, semantics, distribution, and morphological marking. §5.2 discusses word class
semantics and subclassification, focusing on nouns (§5.2.2) adjectives (§5.2.3) and verbs
(§5.2.4) in order. §5.3 turns to word structure and word-formation processes, and includes
subsections on nouns and adjectives §5.3.1, verbs (§5.3.2) and adverbs (§5.3.3). §5.4 and
§5.5 give brief overviews of word class-changing derivations and reduplication
respectively, and §5.6 presents a final summary.","[203, 204]"

1.2.10.2.5. Predicate derivations       Galo has an extremely large and productive set (more than 320 members) of
predicate derivations, or bound predicate stem-expanding formatives. Possibly deriving
diachronically from proto-verb-serialization at the VP or sentence level, the modern
system of Galo predicate derivations is entirely predicate word-internal. Applying with
leftward scope over a predicate stem in an only partially-variable order (due to semantic
scope restrictions), predicate derivations perform a wide array of modifying functions,
listed in §1.2.10.1.4 above. The wide availability of predicate derivations has a profound
effect on the organization of Galo grammar. Many functions coded by auxiliary verbs or
serial verbs in other languages (such as modality, including concepts such as
want/need/must, or try to) are handled by predicate derivations in Galo. In addition, many
complex event-construals which are lexicalized as single words in other languages, such                                              62
as kill (to cause someone to die) are handled compositionally in Galo, as mò-kə̀ ‘make-DEAD’ (reflecting the composition VROOT-PDER). Also many abstract concepts such astime or manner are not lexicalized in Galo, but instead are handled by nominalizing
predicate derivations, as mèn-kór ‘speak-NZR:MANNER’ ‘way of talking’. Accordingly, itis not possible in Galo to form periphrastic expressions such as ‘their ways of talking’, in
which ‘way’ and ‘talk’ can be independently modified; rather, the composition is entirely
word-internal.","[62, 63]"
"
9.2.1.1. Arguments              Argument NPs are projected by the transitivity specification (= caseframe,
subcategorization frame) of the predicate; this process is discussed in detail in §14.1.1 (cf.
                                                                                      29H

              Argument NPs are obligatory features of a Galo clause, and are represented
“underlyingly” whether or not they have overt syntactic realization. In (312), two

transitive clauses occur in sequence. In the first clause, the O argument ŋoí ‘fish’ has beendiscussed in previous clauses, and is ellipsed due to contextual predictability. In the                                                  410
second clause, the A argument ŋunù ‘1.PL’ is coreferential with the preceding clause A;       its ellipsis serves as a partial cue to this fact. 192

               Oblique NPs are not projected by the predicate, but are rather “tacked on” to the
       clause as an optional adjunct. They include a variety of types and preferred positions. In
(313), both of the NPs labelled OBL may be freely inserted into any type of predicative
295H
clause, subject to semantic compatability with the predicate. 193 Unlike argument NPs,
                                                                          192F
oblique NPs which do not occur overtly in the clause are not usually to be viewed as
       “underlyingly” present or understood from context; they are simply not there.

    Cross-clause subject co-referentiality is not an obligatory structural feature of Galo clause chains,
however it has a strong statistical preference. Ellipsis almost always reflects subject continuity. For further
discussion and examples, see §16.4.2.2.3.
193
    For example, an adjectival predicate would be “semantically incompatible” with the oblique noun
phrases in (313), but note that this is not of the nature of a grammatical constraint. To take an example from
English, it is perhaps nonsensical to say I’ll be tall once or twice next month, but there is nothing
grammatically “wrong” in it.

9.2.1.3. Adverbials       Any predicative clause may be freely expanded by one or more adverbials of
almost any type, all of which function to directly modify the predicate. Adverbials in
general have very high syntactic freedom, and may occur in almost any position in the
clause. However, as was also noted in §9.2.1, clauses containing multiple adverbials must
                                            298H
be structured to avoid any unintended interaction. For example, in (315), the speaker’s
                                                                      29H
choice to utter the predicate-modifying adverbial in maazí ‘very much’ before the O NPaverts the possibility of its interpretation as an embedded modifier of the second adverbial
in káa-kèn ‘look-GOOD/EASY’. The remaining adverbials occur in an appositive structure,separated by an intonational pause; this again averts a misconstrual of scope relations.

may precede the subject, which may or may not be (or be coreferential with) an
underlying constituent of the clause. In (316), the pre-core topic is coreferential with the

O argument noun phrase; note however that the topic is not (unlike the argument)
accusative marked. Similarly, it is very common for a clausal nominalization to occur as a
pre-core topic, “framing” a clause by summarizing preceding information (318).            2934H

9.2.2.1. Atransitive and extended atransitive clauses               Atransitive clauses have no core arguments. Such clauses are rare in Galo, as they
seem to be in most languages, and appear to be limited to a handful of clauses describing
weather-related events and (possibly) one sense of the direct speech verb ‘say; tell’. (319)           2940H
is an atransitive clause in dooɲí ‘sun; be sunny’, a lexeme which occurs as both anatransitive predicate head and a noun.
(319) dooɲí duukù
               dooɲí-dùu-kú
               be.sunny-IPFV-CMPL
               ‘It’s gotten sunny.’ (TR, OL6:37)               Although it is possible to insert a topic ‘the sky’ in sentences such as (319), as
                                                                                               2941H
talə́ə=əə dooɲí-dùu-kú ‘sky=TOP be.sunny-IPFV-CMPL’ ‘the sky has gotten sunny’, note       that although talə́ə is topic of the utterance, it is not a syntactic S argument of the       predicate. Unlike all true subjects (§14.1.3.3), talə́ə ‘sky’ cannot be subject-relativized in
                                             294H
dooɲí; nor, indeed, can dooɲí take subject nominalization at all (320).    2943H
(320) *dooɲí nə̀ (talə́ə)
               dooɲí-nà         (talə́ə)
               be.sunny-NZR:SUB (sky)               It is more difficult to argue for the existence of extended atransitive clauses. In
(321), it is clear that the speech report clause has E argument status: a coreferential
294H
nominal may be derived via non-subject nominalization of the predicate (§14.1.3.8).    2945H
However, the clause does not seem to have an underlying subject.

       The difficulty associated with examples like (321) is that, to the extent that the
                                                               2946H

verb; subject-taking (extended) intransitive and (extended) transitive senses of ə́m- ‘say;tell’ are also available (cf. §9.2.2.4.2). Accordingly, it is always possible to perform a
                                        2947H
subject nominalization of a predicate in ə́m- ‘say; tell’, as ə́m-nà ‘say-NZR:SUB’ ‘the onewho said (something)’. That fact notwithstanding, it is quite clear that in many uses of
ə́m- ‘say; tell’, there is no more a ‘sayer’ (S/A) present in the speaker’s construal than
there is a ‘said-to’ (O); it seems more logical to capture this fact through reference to an
available ‘extended atransitive’ caseframe than to claim that an underlyingly present
subject has been ellipsed.","[410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415]"

       12.4.2.3. Concessive imperative -gée              Concessive imperative -gée has the basic sense go ahead and (PRED). It isgenerally used in cases when the speaker knows or believes that the addressee (occurring

performing an action, and is reassuring him or her that in fact there is not (677)-(678). In

       perform the commanded event (679)-(680). Note in (680) that this does not entail

         ‘Away’ imperative in -ée is attested as a suffix to motion predicates only. It entailsa proposal that the actor of the proposed motion event should go away from the place of

         Unlike most other imperative types, ‘Away’ imperative -ée seems to require afollowing hortative particle of some kind. 238 In addition to second-person imperatives, -ée
                                                   237F
‘IPTV.AWAY’ may also form a first person non-singular inclusive hortative in zù (684).             3856H

         ‘Let’s go (away from where we are and) take a look over there.’ (IR, FA 015)
         There are some indications that ‘Away’ imperative -ée may be cognate with the‘Disjunct imperfective’ suffix -ée discussed in §12.5.2.        3857H
12.4.2.6. Permissive -hòo         Permissive -hòo occurs with first person subjects only, and entails a request forpermission from the addressee to allow the speaker to perform the predicated action. In
238
   It is not yet certain whether or not this is an absolute grammatical requirement; it may be, for example,
that in high-context situations, a hortative particle could be left off if the overall mood were understood (as
with the general imperative in -tó; see §12.4.2.1). However, consultants have not accepted such utterances
in elicitation, and due to the relative infrequency of ‘Away’ imperative -ée, no qualifying contexts have yet
been discovered in texts.
                                                          603
practice, use of -hòo appears to be limited to cases where the speaker is proposing to takeover some activity which has already been initiated by the addressee, or which will in
some other way affect the addressee’s activities; in translation, shall I (for you) or why
don’t you let me. Accordingly, predicates in Permissive -hòo are usually also derived inBenefactive -zí. Permissive -hòo is not generally used to request permission to do thingson one’s own behalf (685). Its historical source is unknown.

the speaker is checking with the addressee to be sure that he or she has no objections, or is
otherwise inviting comment on the proposal. However, it does not usually imply that the
speaker lacks permission or is not in control (686)-(688). The historical source of

12.4.2.8. Conjunct intentional -lapə̀         Conjunct intentional -lapə̀ ‘INTN’ seems to be a recently-evolved suffix, whichderives historically from a (still-occurring) complementizer of purpose/intention -lapə̀under matrix clause ellipsis (i.e., de-subordination). This process is described in
§16.6.2.2.1.
 3861H
         As a modal suffix, -lapə̀ ‘INTN’ occurs in declarative clauses with a first personsubject only, or in interrogative clauses with a second person subject. This patterning –
usually described as conjunct – is described in a more general context in §12.5.
                                                                              3862H
Semantically, -lapə̀ ‘INTN’ entails a clear assertion on the speaker’s part of his or herintention to bring about the predicated event/state. Unlike Permissive -hòo orProposal -dèe, the Conjunct intentional in -lapə̀ ‘INTN’ has no sense of “askingpermission”, but rather implies a high degree of speaker control over the situation, as well
as a relatively assertive attitude (689) (cf. also §12.4.2.4 ex. (682)).

In the same way, -lapə̀ ‘INTN’ contrasts with Irrealis -rə́; although both forms predicatenon-real or unrealized events/states, -lapə̀ ‘INTN’ clearly entails a sense of intention orcontrol over a hypothetical future activity which -rə́ ‘IRR’ lacks. Accordingly, -lapə̀ ‘INTN’is more frequent than -rə́ ‘IRR’ in questions regarding a second person’s desires or wishesconcerning a future/irrealis event (690).386H

       which is not generally viewed as reducible to a case of grammatical “agreement” or
       “cross-referencing”. Usually, a structure exhibiting conjunct/disjunct patterning has some
       other, primary function, such as aspect-marking and/or possibly evidentiality. In a
       prototypical conjunct/disjunct system as described for Tibeto-Burman by Hale and
       Manandhar (1980) Delancey (1992) and Hargreaves (2005), one type of marking is
       reserved for main clause statements with first person subjects and questions with second
       person subjects (the “conjunct”), while another type of marking is used in all other cases
       (the “disjunct”). In some if not all languages with conjunct/disjunct systems, the conjunct
       marking type is also used in cases of main/subordinate clause subject-continuity, while
       disjunct marking is used when main/subordinate clause subjects are non-coreferential.
                As was briefly noted in §12.3.2.4, there are indications that (subject) person-
                                          3869H
       sensitivity in aspect-marking may have been a more pervasive feature of early Tani
       grammar, and may be (probably is) still-operating in the main clause morphosyntax of
       some (mainly northern) Tani languages (Sun 2003). In modern Lare Galo, what may have
       been a robust earlier system appears to have largely decayed, and is retained in only a few,
       relatively marginal, constructions. In §12.5.2, we review the set of constructions in which
                                                  3870H
       conjunct/disjunct marking is found in Galo, and then return to an overall appraisal in

two “disjunct” forms, which will be somewhat provisionally described as Perfective -gée‘PFV.DISJ’ and Imperfective -ée ‘IPFV.DISJ’, although their respective semantic values (ingeneral as well as with respect to particular constructions) are not yet completely
understood. The patterning of each of the three mentioned forms is somewhat different
according to the construction.","[600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607]"

15.3.1.4. Secondary nominalized clauses
       Secondary nominalizers, like Primary nominalizers, derive nominalized clauses
through direct suffixation to an uninflected predicate stem. Internally, they also exhibit a
genitive subject; the underlying O argument of a transitive secondary nominalized clause
may be marked in the accusative, but is much more frequently unmarked for case.
Adverbials and oblique noun phrases may occur within a Secondary nominalization
(though they only rarely do); their marking is not different from that at the main clause

level. Here we discuss only the syntactic properties of Secondary nominalized clauses; the
semantic properties of individual Secondary nominalizers are discussed in §11.2.4.1.  458H
               Secondary nominalized clauses generally stand as argument noun phrase heads,
        and have been attested in all core argument functions (S, A, O, E, (V)CS, (V)CC), as well
        as in oblique functions (most often, locative or temporal phrases). Noun phrases headed
        by a Secondary nominalized clause exhibit most ordinary noun phrase properties with
        respect to demonstrative usage, case-marking, and the occurrence of post-head modifiers
        like relator nouns, quantifiers, and post-head relative clauses. However, pre-head
        modifiers such as modifying nominals and pre-head relative clauses do not usually occur
        in an NP headed by a Secondary nominalization, since they would be difficult or
        impossible to distinguish from nominalized clause constituents; similarly, pre-head
        genitive modifiers are usually indistinguishable from nominalized clause subjects.
               The following examples (1028)-(1032) illustrate the use of Secondary
                                         4586H   4587H
nominalized clauses in S, O, CS, CC and oblique functions respectively. Genitive
marking of nominalized clause subjects is illustrated in (1030), non-case-marked and
                                                                       458H
        case-marked realizations of nominalized clause O arguments are illustrated in (1029) and

(1032) respectively, and nominalized clause-internal realization of an adverbial is

           Unlike primary nominalized clauses, Secondary nominalized clauses only rarely
stand as clausal adnominal modifiers (relative clauses and/or clausal nominal
complements). This seems mainly to be due to the prevalence of abstract denotations
among Secondary nominalizers and to the general lack in the Galo lexicon of abstract
nouns with which a Secondary nominalized clause could be potentially be coreferential;
for example, there are no Galo nouns meaning ‘reason’, ‘time’, or ‘manner’ which could
stand as head to an apposed nominalization in -dín ‘NZR:REASON’, -dɨ ́/ə́ ‘NZR:TIME’

      Note that ‘bamboo’ cannot be analysed as NP-head, since ‘big’ modifies ‘hunk’, not ‘bamboo’.

15.3.2.1. Overview
         Clausal nominalizations in Galo differ principally from nominalized clauses in
being more clause-like in terms of both structure and discourse functions. That is to say,
while the nominalized clauses reviewed in §15.3.1 generally function as noun phrase
                                                     4598H
heads or as noun phrase-internal modifiers – either referring to an entity or concept in the
world or modifying such a reference – the constructions discussed in this section more
closely resemble clauses in terms of their usual functions of depicting whole events.
         Clausal nominalization is not open to Secondary nominalizers (§15.3.1.4); only459H
primary nominalizers may occur in a clausal nominalization. Also unlike nominalized
clauses, in some subtypes of clausal nominalization, the nominalizer may suffix to an
inflected predicate, as well as to an uninflected predicate stem. However, nominalizers
which occur on an inflected predicate do not follow predicate/clause-final particles; this
would suggest that they retain their basic status as predicate suffixes, and do not function
as clause-level operators per se – despite the more clause-like function of the structure
they mark. Finally, and again unlike nominalized clauses, subjects of clausal
nominalizations are not (ever) marked in the genitive; instead, subjects of clausal297
   In fact, the prevalence of Secondary nominalizers capable of deriving abstract nominals quite likely in
part explains the absence of such nouns in the lexicon.

inflectional subclasses, obligatoriness, order and co-occurrence possibilities and
restrictions. Subsequent sections discuss the major functional classes of predicate
inflections in this order: negation (§12.2), aspect (§12.3) (comprising two subsections on

12.1.    Overview
         Predicate inflections occur as suffixes to a predicate stem (§10.2). The                   3682H
prototypical site of predicate inflection is the head of a main (= final) predicative clause;
the full range of forms described in this chapter may occur in that environment. A subset
of the forms described below may also occur on the predicate of a dependent (=
nominalized, non-final or adverbially subordinated) clause; these possibilities are
discussed in the context of dependent clauses in §15 and §16, and are not discussed at any
                                                                      368H                  3684H
length in this chapter.
         Predicate inflection in a main predicative clause is to a great extent obligatory in
Galo. Although it is sometimes possible in casual speech to hear a final predicate which
consists only of a derived predicate stem (with the inflection seemingly ellipsed), such
utterances are extremely rare in my corpus; the overwhelming majority (> 99%) are
overtly inflected (see also §10.3).
                                 3685H
         The majority of predicate inflections occur alone (i.e., they do not co-occur with
other predicate inflections), and license a final predicate. Predicate inflections which are
capable of licensing a final predicate are described as Primary predicate inflections in this
work. Examples are in (605)-(606).

commonly-used Secondary predicate inflection by far is Completive aspectual suffix -kú‘CMPL’ (609)-(610).

Negator -máa is treated as a distinct form inasmuch as it may license a final predicate by                                                570
suffixing to a bound verb root, whereas the identified cognate forms are grammatical
words.
           Semantically, a predicate in -máa is inherently unspecified for anytemporal/aspectual value, unless it is further marked by an aspectual suffix of some kind
(cf. (606)-(607) above). In a discourse context, the aspectual value of a clause marked
    370H     3701H
only in -máa is inherited from a previous aspectually-specified clause, or else is inferredbased on temporal expressions or other contextual factors. In (614), the inferred
                                                                  3702H
perfective value of the negated predicate in káa- ‘have/exist’ is derived from thepreceding, thematically-related clause which is marked in Perfective -tó.(614) kocarí əkə̀ akên-âɲi gò rətó. ɲíi kəbə̀ kaamá.

           Although unspecified for an aspectual value, clauses in -máa tend to have adefault realis interpretation. In a clause describing some hypothetical or potential future
negative state of affairs, an irrealis marker is most often present, as in (615).

6.1.2.2.9. Particles        Particles may or may not be best analysed as noun phrase-internal constituents;
many co-occur with other phrase types – always phrase-finally – and some “versatile”                                                      298

constituent positions – often observing prosodic rather than grammatical rules for
insertion – in a variety of grammatical phrase types. Such matters are discussed and
exemplified in detail in §13.                2416H
                  For the present, the important point to note is that if and to the extent that particles
occur as noun phrase-internal constituents, their position is always last in the phrase. An
example is given in (115).           2417H

                  It is extremely common to find noun phrases which have “underlying”, or
understood, nominal heads, but in which the head is not overtly expressed. Usually, such
“headless” NPs occur in conditions of high contextual predictability, and are quite
common in natural discourse.
                  Not all NP constituents may occur in, or “license” a headless NP. In general,
constituents which are themselves nominals, or which are historically derived from
nominals are more likely to license head ellipsis. They include genitive phrases (116),                           2418H
relative clauses (116), numerals and classifiers (117) and some but possibly not all relator
                             2419H                                240H
nouns (118)-(119). NP constituents which can not license a headless NP include modifying
           241H        24H
nominals, case markers/postpositions, articles, and particles. “Standalone” use of
demonstratives is regarded as a pronominal function in Galo rather than an instance of a
headless NP. Evidence for this view lies in the fact that while all true demonstratives may
“bracket” an NP, bracketing uses are not possible if the head is ellipsed (§7.4). 133               243H   132F
Similarly, qualifying nouns in “standalone” uses may be closer to pronominal uses than to
headless NP uses per se (see §8.3).                  24H

      I.e., while it is possible to say simply hɨgɨ ̀ ‘SPRX.IND’ ‘this one’ or hɨgɨ ̀ iki ̀i hɨgɨ ̀ ‘SPRX.IND dog SPRX.IND’
‘this here dog’, it is not possible to say *hɨgɨ ̀ Ø hɨgɨ ̀ ‘SPRX.IND Ø SPRX.IND’.

basically nouns or are historically derived from nouns, that they are not in fact standing as
NP heads in these examples may be demonstrated by two facts. First, the denotationalvalues of the bracketed noun phrases in (116)-(119) are all underdetermined by their
                                                   247H     248H
constituents; i.e., it is clear from the discourse context that dór-úm=əə‘CLF:HIGH.ANIMAL-three=TOP’ in (117) refers to three rats rather than any other set of
                                    249H
three animals, and the semantic value ‘rat’ is not overtly carried within this NP due to
head-ellipsis. Second, any additional modifiers which occur in the NP refer to the ellipsed
head, not to the overt constituents. For example, if the adjectival subject relative clause
kaí-nà ‘big-NZR:SUB’ is inserted into (119), the resulting sense is of the ‘top of a big
                                           2430H
stone’, not ‘big top of a stone’.
        That said, there are certainly cases in which it becomes difficult to argue for the
headedness of a particular noun phrase, due to the transparently nominal origin of many
functional NP constituents. Numerous marginal cases may be found in the data, some of
                                                          300
which may be reflective of historical intermediacy as basic nouns develop increasingly
functional statuses; this is of course to be expected. Some examples will be adduced in
passing in §8 below.

anything similarly functionally-motivated, but rather to the historical fact that (if our

9.5.1.2.3. Cleft/focus          The most explicit, versatile and frequent means of forming a content question is
via an interrogative cleft/focus construction, discussed in the broader context of
cleft/focus constructions in §9.4. Most types of constituent may be questioned in this
                                 3089H

          Non-declarative clauses other than interrogatives more closely resemble main
declarative clauses in terms of basic syntax and marking. Specific indications of
illocutionary force are encoded in most cases either via different modality inflections
(§12.4.2), via clause-final particles (§13.3.1), or via a combination of the two. Intonation

sometimes plays a role, particularly in cases where imperative or other non-declarative
speech act markers are homophonous with and probably derived historically from
aspectual suffixes. Most imperatives and hortatives are obligatorily second person in Galo,
although some suggestives can only occur in first person; these are discussed in several
subsections in §12.4.2. Third person hortatives can only occur if licensed via a special

10. Predicate complex10.1.   Overview        Chapters §10-§12 discuss aspects of the predicate complex. By “predicate
                    309H   310H
complex”, is meant a word or closely-related, tightly-clustered set of words which
together realize the head of a predicative clause (§9.2), from which clausal argument
                                                                               310H
structure and temporal-aspectual structure are projected and on which clause-level
inflections (such as Aspect and Modality suffixes) occur.
        Galo predicates are prototypically headed by a verb (“prototypically” in the sense
of having the greatest statistical frequency and greatest set of structural/behavioural
possibilities). However, the term “verb phrase” is avoided for two reasons; first, because
of the technical sense in which this term is traditionally used, namely as a high-level
clause constituent consisting of a verbal head plus a variety of other phrase- or word-level
syntactic constituents (Haegeman 1991:78-88). Clear evidence for such a high-level
constituent has not yet been discovered in Galo. Second, because it is also possible for
adjectives to stand as head of a predicate complex (see §5.1.2). Additionally, the term
                                                                                      3102H
“phrase” is avoided more here because of the normal implications of head/dependent
internal syntactic constituencies. Unlike other types of “phrases” identified in Galo
(especially the noun phrase; see §6.1.2), a Multiword predicate complex is not always
                                                  310H
clearly divisible into hierarchical constituencies in the same sense (cf. the discussion of
Multiword predicates in §10.5). Finally, we can note that clause-final particles – which
                                  3104H
often quite clearly have clause-level rather than phrase-level scope – are often difficult to
characterize as clearly “within” or “outside” of a grammatical phrase headed by the
predicate. For these and other similar reasons, the albeit somewhat ambiguous term
“complex” is preferred in this work to the more precise yet potentially misleading term
“phrase”.
        In the remainder of the chapter, §10.2 presents an overview of basic predicate
                                                         3105H
structure. §10.3 identifies three possible stem types and discusses their different
            3106H
possibilities for derivation and inflection, and §10.4 briefly discusses predicate transitivity
                                                                       3107H
and argument structure. In §10.5 we discuss more complex “Multiword predicates”; §10.6
                                          3108H                                               3109H
closes with a discussion of possibilities for predicate word-internal “interruption” by
“versatile” particles.","[439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444]"

9.2.2.4.1. Motion        Motion clauses are headed by motion verbs, which may be either activity-oriented
or goal-oriented (cf. §5.2.4.2). Activity- and goal-oriented motion predicates differ in
                        2961H
terms of the argument structures they project over the clause. Activity-oriented motion
predicates are intransitive, and project only an Actor argument S. Goal-oriented motion
predicates are extended intransitive, and project an Actor argument S and a Goal
argument E. Accordingly, clauses headed by an activity-oriented motion verb (like almost
any type of activity-oriented intransitive clause) may or may not exhibit a Locative-
marked oblique NP, denoting the location in which the activity takes place. By contrast, in
a clause headed by a goal-oriented motion verb, the Goal argument is obligatory.
Although Location and Goal NPs often share the same (usually Locative) marking, several
facts illustrate their underlying difference. For example, while Location-denoting obliques
are obligatorily Locative-marked (329), Goal arguments of motion verbs only optionally
                                   296H
                                             417
take Locative marking, and are very often zero-marked (330). The difference has to do
                                                             2963H
with the prototypicality or predictability (≅ definiteness) of the Goal. In (330), the Actor
                                                                              2964H
is described as going up to her own granary, something she might be expected to do on a
regular basis. In (331), the Actor arrives at a new village for the first time; accordingly,
                      2965H
the goal is Locative-marked. Zero-marking of highly predictable core arguments is
discussed in a more general context in §14.2.1.1. For additional discussion of E argument

9.2.2.4.2. Locution and cognition
             The principal Galo verbs of locution are záp- ‘talk’ mèn- ‘speak’ and ə́m- ‘besaid; say; tell’. The principal verb of cognition is mə́ə- ‘think; want; like’. mə́ə- ‘think;want; like’ has a basic transitive caseframe, with an Actor A and an Experiencer O. záp-‘talk’ and mèn- ‘speak’ both project basic extended transitive structures, in which theSpeaker occurs as A, the Message as O and the Addressee as E.

       Clauses in mèn- ‘speak’ and mə́ə- ‘think’ also exhibit an extended intransitivestructure in which a “direct contents” phrase or clause occurs post-clausally (it cannot
precede the predicate). Note that the extended intransitive sense is distinct from the
transitive senses discussed above; in (333), no O argument may occur inside the clause.

Inan ə́m-headed clause, a “direct contents” phrase or clause occurs clause-internally (itcannot follow the predicate). In the extended intransitive sense of ə́m- ‘say’, an Actor Susually precedes the direct content report (334). Further discussion may be found in the

9.3.1. Verbless clauses
                    Verbless clauses consist of two NPs which stand apposed in a predicative relation,
but which lack an overt predicator (inflected verb or adjective, or copula). Following
Dixon (2006), the two noun phrases of a verbless clause are described here as core
arguments VCS (Verbless Clause Subject) and VCC (Verbless Clause Complement). Note
that neither VCS nor VCC is itself a “predicate” (hence we will not refer to “nominal
predicates/predicate nominals” in Galo); rather, predication is viewed as a function of the
appositive clause structure itself.
                    The basic structure of a verbless clause is presented in Table 9.2/Figure 9.4.
                                                                              297H     2978H

[VCS] – [VCC] – [PCL]Figure 9.4 – Elements of a verbless clause
                    Semantically, Galo verbless clauses are limited to predication of an
equative/identity or attributive relation between two NPs (335).       297H

             194
NP.   193F         VCC may be a pronoun or proper name; if a common NP it may be either zero-marked (336) or indefinite, and marked in go ‘IND’. Under no circumstances may a VCC
                    2980H
argument be topic-marked (337). 195     2981H   194F
194
    Indefinite noun phrases in VCS function are unattested, but cannot currently be ruled out as a
grammatical impossibility.
195
    A topic-marked VCC would render the clause structurally indistinguishable from a copula clause. For
further discussion on this point, see §9.3.4.

6.1. Types of noun phrase, headedness, constituency and order
6.1.1. Overview
        Four major types of NP are found in Galo. They differ in terms of head type,

proper name-headed NPs differ from other NP types in terms of the types of modification
they may take. Among post-head modifiers, proper names are not modified by articles.
Use of basic demonstratives with proper names is also relatively restricted; instead,
demonstrative use of pronouns, as in (122), is relatively high (§7.1.5.1; §14.2). Among

        The occurrence of pre-head demonstratives and genitive phrases in a proper name-
headed NP is somewhat uncertain. Certainly, they are attested, but such uses are generally
marked and may be better described as instances of taking a proper name to stand, in a
syntactic sense, as a common nominal (as if one were to say, in English, that Jim is a
bastard or our Phil is a fine little boy). In (123), note that the name toopó-gonə́ is not

marking is not generally a property of proper name-headed NPs, we might infer that
toopó-gonə́ is here functioning syntactically as a common nominal.","[302, 303]"

1.2.8. Standardization and de facto standards        It is common among both linguistics and laypeople to refer to “standard” varieties
of languages. In identifying “standard” forms of a language, one admits that a multiplicity
of varieties exist, but also implies that the “non-standard” varieties are to be treated (in
some sense, or in certain domains) as lesser objects of study or as providing more dubious
points of reference than a “standard” variety. My personal belief is that this bias
represents a complete inversion of the proper and improper objects of descriptive
linguistics; indeed, “standard” forms of languages are generally subject to artificially
normative pressures, and may therefore offer up data points in certain domains which do
not in fact fall within the province of a naturally-evolved system.
        In any case, this sort of construction cannot be easily applied to the Galo language.
The reasons for this are many, but certainly include the fact that, since Galo is not in fact
officially recognized as a language at all, there have been no official (as in government-
authorized) efforts at standardization. More to the point, Galo are traditionally a highly
egalitarian people, and would, it seems to me, be as unlikely to be seen attempting to
19
   From my personal field experiences, it is far from uncommon to come across a family in which four or
five distinct speech types (whether “languages” or “dialects”) are controlled by many if not all members of
the household, and used on a daily basis. In one of my host households, for example, I found the father of
the house speaking the gensìi Galo dialect of his birthplace, one gensìi-speaking mother and another from a
nearby Mising community, living in an area dominated by larèe and taíi(podia) Galo, whose children are
educated in Hindi and English and who conduct daily business mainly in Assamese. This septalingual
family is perhaps not prototypical, but is not of a rare type either.
                                                    47
impose their own views and norms upon others as they would be to passively accept such
impositions upon themselves.
        In absence of an official standard, we may inquire about de facto standards, which
could be “prestige” or “majority” dialects; here again, though, we fall into difficulty.
There is no dialect of Galo which is clearly more “prestigious” than others; although the
puugóo dialect spoken in and around the district capital Along perhaps comes closest to
being a prestige dialect due to its natural association with local government and economic
prosperity, and seems overall to be the preferred dialect for Galo popular song recordings,
most non-puugóo speakers show few if any signs of feeling pressured to conform topuugóo norms outside of these limited contexts. Furthermore, the aggregate population ofpuugóo dialect speakers appears to be considerably smaller than that of larèe and itssubdialects, and the geographical area within which larèe is spoken is certainly far largerthan that in which puugóo is spoken.","[47, 48]"
"
1.2.11. Number of speakers and degree of endangerment
       By comparison with many languages, both in North-East India and elsewhere in
the world, Galo’s degree of endangerment is not high. Access to the Galo area, and
indeed most areas of Arunachal Pradesh, remains tightly restricted by the Government of
India; and since the Galo remain overwhelmingly dominant in their area, their language is
spoken daily and learned as a first language by a majority of children (though certainly
not by all). No reliable survey on the number of Galo speakers (as opposed to Galo
tribespeople, who do not always speak Galo) has to date been conducted. The 1981
Census of India put the number of “Adi Gallong” tribespeople at 8,999 (Hussain 1995).
However, the 1991 census puts the figure at a bursting 45,616! This increase is clearly not
solely due to population growth, but rather reflects the extreme difficulties of demarcating
tribal and linguistic categories in North-East India, and the absence of any effective or
commonly agreed-upon means for doing so. Depending on where lines are drawn, based
on the current population of the “scheduled tribes” of West Siang district, 84,922 (West
Siang District Economics and Statistics Deptartment 2004) – the number of Galo speakers
may be estimated at around 30,000-40,000 (or more, depending on where lines are drawn)
with at least half of them being speakers of some form of Lare. These are relatively
healthy-looking numbers when one considers that historically, the number of Galo
speakers must have been much lower.
       However, changes in this comfortable status quo are already apparent. With
improvements in communication, economic opportunities, and the reach of regional,
national and even international media into Arunachal Pradesh, Galo are increasingly
relying on more widely spoken Indo-European languages – usually Hindi and Assamese,
but also English – when leaving their immediate home surroundings. Families who can
afford to invariably send their children away to boarding schools at an early age, since
good quality government schools are not found in most Arunachali localities. These often
                                             63
religiously-oriented boarding schools often actively discourage use of a child’s native
language (sometimes punishing those who speak their native language with their peers),
with the result that children attending such boarding schools end up spending the bulk of
their childhood speaking Hindi; naturally, such children will tend to control this language
better than their “native” language by the time they are young adults. Complex
technological or novel objects are invariably named in English or Hindi rather than in
Galo. In certain Assamese contact areas in the foothills, loanword use is often extreme, to
the point where native grammar has come to largely provide a partial shell for an almost
wholly borrowed lexicon.
       While this is not an unusual phenomenon among the tribal languages of India (and
elsewhere), it is also perhaps not desirable from the point of view of the preservation of
North-East Indian cultural heritage, and the preservation and vibrancy of Galo culture in
particular. The structures of Galo and Indo-European grammars are vastly different, and
are in many important ways incompatible; often, to adopt a borrowed structure is not to
alternate with the native structure, but rather to replace it.
       To take a simple example, it is practically impossible to integrate borrowed verb
roots into the Galo system of morphological verb stem expansions (i.e. predicate
derivations), due to differences in the semantic and functional ranges handled lexically
and derivationally in Galo and in Indo-European languages. English check (VT.) – a
frequently borrowed word – lexically incorporates the ‘Tentative’ aspect for which an
independent native form -káa ‘TENT’ exists in Galo (thus, English check is most closelytranslated by the bi-morphemic Galo expression káa-káa- ‘look-TENT’ (§11.2.3.1)). Withaspect already lexically encoded by the loanword, native stem-expanding aspect markers
not only are not used, they cannot be used: *cék-káa- ‘check-TENT’ is unacceptable. Inthis sense, use of a loaned verb does not simply substitute one word for another – a
relatively benign and common enough thing in any language – it actually precludes use of
an entire swathe of Galo grammar. To take a different sort of example, the relatively low
salience and variability of tones in Galo means that many young people with limited
exposure to their native language do not learn the tone system perfectly. Such speakers
have been observed to deliberately and consciously use loanwords to replace one or more
terms which are homophonous to them, but which in their parents’ speech are minimal
pairs on tone. The speech of some young Galo in high Indic contact areas may be
described as almost completely atonal and, in this as well as in other ways, partially
unintelligible unless loanwords are used.","[63, 64]"

13. Particles               The present chapter discusses particles, defined as non-relational, non-inflectional
functional words which modify a major syntactic constituent (most often, an NP or a
Predicate/Clause). The first section §13.1 discusses the overall structural and functional
                                                3892H
properties of particles. The following sections §13.2 and §13.3 discuss particles which
                                                                         389H   3894H
bind to the noun phrase and predicate or clause, respectively. §13.4 supplements the    3895H
preceding two sections, discussing particles which appear to be recent loans from Indic
languages (and which are not used by all Galo speakers), and §13.5 discusses “versatile”        3896H
particles, which bind to any major constituent. The chapter is closed by sections §13.6                 3897H
and §13.7, which discuss interjective particles and interjections respectively.
        389H
13.1.          Overview
13.1.1. Synchronic perspective
               Particle is not a well-defined term either in principle or, usually, in practice. 240            239F
The most restrictive definition and consistent application of which I am aware is that of
Matisoff (1973: 154), who defines “particle” with respect to Lahu as a category
containing all and only bound syntactic words (i.e., words which cannot head a phrase,
which cannot stand as a headless phrase, and/or which cannot in any other way occur as
an independent syntactic constituent).
               While potentially satisfying on a purely structural basis, if there is a difficulty with
this definition, it may be the amount of functional diversity it admits. In addition to some
of the highly pragmatically-oriented, often clause-final functional words commonly found
in South East Asian languages – which are traditionally described as “particles” due to
their relatively small size and seemingly obscure word-class status – Matisoff’s definition
commits the analyst to including most types of adposition, case enclitic, and article, as
well as some forms probably traditionally described as “adverbs”, in a class whose
functional range then would extend from syntactic role marking to referential status
marking all the way to speaker attitude/stance marking.
               In the present work, markers of grammatical and/or referential status are treated as
(internal) phrasal constituents (§6.1.2, §14.2-§14.3); “particle” then denotes a relatively
                                         389H           390H     3901H
240
  It may be no exaggeration to say that while “adverb” is often used to describe a relatively large word
whose categorical status cannot be otherwise determined, “particle” is often used to describe a relatively
small one.
                                                               612
more “optional”, usually post-phrasal form, which provides supplementary (non-basic,
non-obligatory, and/or non-inflectional) pragmatic or epistemic information, and which
can often mark multiple constituent types and/or occur in more than one syntactic position
with the same basic function. This definition is almost certainly not watertight, neither in
the sense of clearly distinguishing particles from phrasal operators, nor in the sense of
enabling clearcut recognition of all and only the members of a well-motivated natural
class. Unfortunately, as with the “adverbs” and “prepositions” of English, the syntactic
and functional diversity of the Galo particle class is such that a well-motivated
subclassification would have to take an enormous range of synchronic and diachronic
facts into account – a project which both demands a much larger speech corpus than that
currently available and a work of more specialized approach. Thus, although an effort has
been made here to group and subclassify particles on well-motivated distributional and
functional grounds, both the category as a whole and its subclassification should be
viewed as highly provisional and subject to revision as more data become available.","[611, 612, 613]"

16.6.1. Overview
                The present section discusses complementation types and strategies, in the
structurally/typologically-oriented senses developed by Dixon (2006). 319             318F
Complementation is not particularly rich in Galo, seemingly due to two principal factors:
                First, while in some languages many secondary concepts (concepts which stand in
relation to other concepts or propositions) such as ‘want (to do/obtain something)’ and319
    To summarize only briefly, a clause is a “complement clause” if and only if it stands as an argument of a
verb, and (in doing so) satisfies the subcategorization requirements of that verb (i.e., it is a core argument,
in the sense developed in §14.1). A “complementation strategy” describes a looser periphrastic (but
possibly in some way marked) construction which resembles complementation in some more functional
sense, but which does not satisfy the conditions stated above.
                                                     834
‘try (to do something)’ are expressed as lexical verbs or auxiliaries, in Galo they usually
occur as predicate derivations (§11.2). However, see below for at least one Indic-derived
                                        4867H
exception to this general state of affairs in Galo.
               Second, while in some languages information related to the epistemic status of
propositions is handled lexically, often via complement clause-taking verbs such as
‘suppose (that something is the case)’ or ‘believe (that something is the case)’, in Galo it
is most often handled via clause-final particles with propositional semantic scope (§13.3).           486H
16.6.2. Complement clauses
16.6.2.1. Modal complement of necessity/obligation in -pə̀ lagi ́-/lage
               Together with a number of other Tani languages, Galo exhibits a modal
construction of necessity/obligation in -pə̀ lagi ́-/lage which represents one of the few veryrobust examples of well-assimilated loaned and, potentially also, calqued material from
an Indic language. Given the semantics involved, it seems very likely that the
construction initially developed in the Tani languages in the context of trade. 320 In this  319F
construction, the most frequent modal operator lagí- is derived from the non-final form ofthe Assamese verb root lag- ‘want; need; attach/affix’, lag-i. In Galo, lagí- also occurs asa lexical verb meaning ‘want/need/desire (something)’; in this sense, it is capable of
taking a common nominal O argument construed as a concrete wanted, needed or desired
entity (1150).

   Given the relative overall lack of well-assimilated Indic lexicon and grammar in the Tani languages, this
very robust exception represents a critical point of reference in any reconstruction of the (pre-)history of
Tani-Indic contact. Although it seems clear that the construction occurs widely in Tani, the extant sources
are not sufficiently detailed to enable us to determine whether the construction may be dated to a particular
historical stage, or whether it may have been repeatedly, and independently, innovated in different Tani
languages. Further research into this question would be of very high cross-disciplinary value.
                                                    835
                When used as a modal verb with the sense ‘want/need (something to happen)’, the
O argument slot is filled by a predicative complement clause. In this construction, the
        complement clause predicate is usually uninflected, and is obligatorily marked by a
        proprietary nominalizer -pə̀ ‘CTZR:IRR’, which may be suffixed directly to a verb root(1151) or derived verb stem (1152), as well as to a predicative adjective (1153).

Complement clause predicates inflected in irrealis -rə́ ‘IRR’ have only rarely been attested(1154); no other predicate inflections seem to be allowed. Unlike a common nominal O

argument, the complement clause is not case-marked. 321                320F

                The origin of the complementizing suffix -pə̀ CTZR:IRR’ may be in PTB        nominalizer *pa (LaPolla 2003), a form which, while it has widespread reflexes in other        TB languages, is but sparsely attested in Galo. In complementizing function, it derives a
clause with irrealis semantics which may be consonant with ‘Uncertainty epistemic
321
           Since only referential O arguments are case-marked in Galo (§14.3.2), and an irrealis complement of
        necessity/obligation is quite obviously non-referential, this fact should not be too surprising.

construction represents a calque on the Assamese modal of necessity, whose form may be
schematized as [[V-bɔ]COMPL [lag-]VT]] (in which -bɔ is the Assamese subordinatingnominalizer). However, given a plausible Tani-internal etymology it seems unwise to
suppose Galo -pə̀ ‘CTZR:IRR’ to itself reflect Assamese -bɔ – a possibility which is, in anycase, phonologically less than plausible.
        In most attestations, the modal verb has been inflected like any other final
predicate, as in (1151)-(1152). Sometimes, a speaker may choose to present a form which
                         4876H          487H
is inflected (more or less) according to an Assamese predicate inflectional paradigm; most
often, such forms will be in the Assamese third person present -e, as in (1153) (for        487H
imperfective predications) or third person past imperfective -is-il-e (for perfectivepredications). Such formations are far more common in Assamese contact areas, and are
considered poor form by many Galo speakers; certainly, Assamese-inflected forms
represent a minority of mentions in my corpus, with the majority of attestations following
native Galo inflectional paradigms (as in (1150)-(1152) and (1154)).

        Complement clauses in -pə̀ CTZR:IRR’ obligatorily share the same subject as thehigher clause. The complement clause subject is also obligatorily ellipsed. Thus, while it
is not possible in Galo to express a sentence with the sense ‘I need him to go’ using the
modal of necessity in lagí-, it is possible to, for example, causativize the complementclause predicate to form an expression like ‘I want to send him away’, etc.
        The prototypical form of the Galo modal of necessity/obligation construction is
schematized in Figure 16.10.

something); like/love (someone); want (something)’. Sense 1 ‘think (about an idea)’ also
licenses an appositional complementation strategy, discussed in §16.6.2.3 (cf. also

        48H
be an extension of Sense 2 ‘reckon’, and entails a proposition regarding the subject’s own
directly-experienced opinions or mental state. A complement clause in -lapə̀‘CTZR:PURP/INTN’ exhibits obligatory complement clause-main clause subject-
coreferentiality; seemingly, this would relate to the fact that it is not possible for an
individual to directly experience the thoughts or intentions of another individual (1155)- 485H

                       487H

As in a modal complement of necessity/obligation in -pə̀ ‘CTZR:IRR’, the complementizer        of purpose and intention -lapə̀ ‘CTZR:PURP/INTN’ almost always suffixes directly to an        uninflected predicate stem, although complement clause predicate inflection in Irrealis -rə́‘IRR’ is also occasionally attested.
               Although usually occurring without any additional marking, it is evidently
possible for a complement of purpose/intention in -lapə̀ ‘CTZR:PURP/INTN’ to be marked in        Locative lo ‘LOC’. Consultants suggest that the event presented in a Locative-markedcomplement clause is viewed as relatively less likely to come about. The difference an
unmarked and locative-marked complement clause of purpose/intention may be roughly
(certainly not perfectly) conveyed via English thinking of/about going – in which a real
        possibility of going is considered – versus thinking on going – in which going is
considered in the abstract rather than as a real possibility (1158)-(1159).

which the main clause predicate in mə́ə- ‘think’ is systematically ellipsed, -lapə̀‘CTZR:INTN’ seems to have further developed functionality as a modal inflection of
intention (also discussed in the more general context of predicate inflections in §12.4.2.8).

In some uses, the matrix predicate may or may not be mentioned, with little difference in
meaning. (1160) is one such example, in which a matrix predicate mə́ə-dùu ‘think-IPFV’

could occur clause-finally as in (1161), with the translation remaining the same. In such
                                  4895H
examples, my consultants often claim that the matrix verb is underlyingly present, but has
been ellipsed due to “speaking shortly”.

following a final clause. The development in this case seems to be made possible via
deletion of a nominalized predicate under copula scope mə́ə-dùu-nà=əə‘think-IPFV-NZR:SUB=COP.IPFV’. However, re-insertion of the nominalized predicate in
this case does cause a semantic difference: namely, the sentence is now be understood as
assuring the addressee of the reality of the speaker’s thinking (about his intention), not
about the contents of his intention per se (1163).

7. Pro-forms, including demonstratives       The present chapter discusses pro-forms, including pronouns, pro-adverbials, and
demonstratives. Many pro-forms have the ability to both stand alone as head of a noun
phase and to modify another noun phrase head. Others have the ability to stand as noun
phrase head only, lacking modifier capacity, and a few others – generally, when serving
in extended rather than basic functions – have the ability to stand as modifiers only,
lacking the ability to stand as a phrasal head. These properties will be discussed in
passing throughout the chapter.
       All of the forms to be discussed herein have a common functional status in
forming a definitely referring expression in terms of, or in relation to, a shifting deictic
centre (usually, but not always, relatable to the speech situation). Many of the forms
discussed below also share common structural properties; in most cases, they may be
described in terms of relatively smaller sets of etymologically simplex (monosyllabic)
formatives which have combined historically with etymological postpositions and/or
suffixes to form synchronically non-compositional, usually disyllabic, forms; etymology
and compositionality will also be treated below, where possible. Many of the
demonstratives discussed below – usually, those which incorporate historical
postpositions – play a key role in noun phrase relational marking. Such functions will be
mentioned in passing below, but are treated more substantially in a language-general
context in §14.

7.1. Personal pronouns
       Lare Galo personal pronouns encode the person and number of an animate
referent. Persons are first (speaker), second (addressee) or third (person other than
speaker or addressee, whether male or female). Formally unmarked pronouns encode
singular number reference. Marked pronouns encode dual (two) or plural (more than two)
number reference (Table 7.1).

        Comparing the set of Pugo and Lare Galo personal pronouns in Table 7.1-Table

7.2, we see that the principle difference is the irregular mutation of /b/ → /m/ in the thirdperson set found in Pugo (with attendant progressive nasal harmonization of the plural
formative in the third person plural form). In fact, it is also quite common to hear the third
person in mɨ ̀ɨ uttered by Lare speakers as well, even in the context of otherwise resolutelyLare speech; consider example (151) – spoken by a lifelong resident of daarɨ ̀ɨ village, in
                                 253H
the heartland of the Lare area – in which the conservative and highly characteristic Lare
form of the Additive particle cìn (PG *cìn; cf. Pugo sìn) is juxtaposed against theinnovative third person singular pronoun form in mɨ ̀ɨ. This is a typical example, whichsuggests the susceptibility of the pronoun set to change irregularly through areal diffusion
– not only in Galo, but, probably, in other Tani languages as well. In this grammar, the
third singular pronoun has been consistently identified as bɨ ̀ɨ, reflecting the conservativeLare pronunciation, although mɨ ̀ɨ pronunciations are preserved in the surface transcriptionline where attested. For further discussion, see §7.1.3.

         First and second person singular pronouns ŋó and nó are among the very fewwords in Galo with an underlyingly monomoraic structure. This fact is particularly
striking in view of their seeming history as bimoraic forms (see §7.1.3), as well as their
                                                                               253H
paradigmatic opposition to a clearly bimoraic form in third person singular bɨ ̀ɨ. Inprosodic contexts which demand a bimoraic phonological word structure, ŋó and nóexhibit regular rhyme lengthening (§4.1.3.5). Under C(V)-suffixation, ŋó and nó are

opposed to bɨ ̀ɨ in regularly recruiting the suffix-initial consonant to satisfy bimoraicityrequirements in a stressed prosodic context – thus confirming their status as underlyingly
monomoraic forms (§4.1.4.6). These facts are summarized in Table 7.3.

7.1.1. Animacy
         Lare Galo personal pronouns prototypically refer to humans; however, they may
also refer to higher animals even in non-personified contexts. In such cases, the referred-
to animal will usually be under construal as relatively highly animate, as when a specific
individual features prominently in a narrative; example (152) is taken from a text
                                                               2539H

14.2.1.3. Definiteness and topicality
        There are few terms in linguistics more embattled than “topic”; although it would
seem that a near-consensus is emerging concerning a grammar-independent, cross-
linguistically-applicable pragmatic definition of topic – i.e., the topic is what a
proposition is about (Lambrecht 1994) – the step of applying this definition to the
determination of sentence form in a given language is a far more complex proposal. Is
topic directly “marked” by any particular grammatical structure or structures? Or do                                              702
particular grammatical structures – which may or may not have themselves evolved in the
specific context of “topic marking”, and/or which may be sensitive to semantic or
pragmatic factors other than or in addition to referent topicality – independently interact
with a (still pragmatic) concept of “topic”? In what follows, I do not attempt to address
these overarching questions, which require a more in-depth study of Galo discourse than
has yet been conducted (and would certainly include mention of certain structures, such
as zero-marking, which have already been discussed). Rather, the approach here is more
closely centered-on more or less consistent structural patterns which exist in Galo
grammar – in particular, the behaviour of a noun phrase marker əə – and which appearmore or less consistent with topic marking functions (or which might have evolved their
present functions at least in part as earlier topic markers). A more comprehensive study is
certainly warranted, and remains to be conducted.
              The principal function of Topic marker әә 273 is marking of definite reference to an
                                                         27F
already well-individuated, identifiable and “accessible” (i.e., “known” or “given”) entity,
generally as it is construed as contrastive with other such entities for establishment as the
topic of a given clause. In the following sequence from a narrative (885)-(889), the clause
                                                                             4279H   4280H
topics (also in this case all grammatical subjects) are shown in bold. In this sequence,
there are four well-individuated referents, which all participate to some degree in the
events depicted in each mentioned clause – a boy, a dog, a container and a window.
Disregarding for the moment the manner in which each referent is introduced, and the
degree to which each of the four referents might be said to have topic-accessibility, we
might say that all four referents are at some or all stages given as potential topics, and that
topic-marking in consort with overt NP-coding, when it occurs, occurs in contrastive
(re-)establishment of a particular referent as topic for some duration of ensuing clauses.
When the same topic is subsequently maintained over a period of two or more clauses, it
will tend to be ellipsed (as in the sequence below); or, if the series of clauses is
particularly long, it will tend to be coded by (non-topic-marked) resumptive pronouns
(see §7.1.5 for discussion and examples of pronoun use in topic-maintenance).
      4281H
  The Topic marker əə both triggers and is subject to morphophonological processes which can obscure its
273phonetic realization. For a summary of the phonetics and phonology of the Topic marker, see §4.3.

possible for all dual and plural personal pronouns, as well as third person singular
pronoun bɨ ̀ɨ (but not for first and second personal pronouns ŋó and nó, nor for mostdemonstratives when used pronominally), to be marked for topicality. 275 Generally  274F

  This distribution seems to be historically explainable in terms of the respective etymologies of the Topic
marker and the individual pronouns, and (therefore) to not have a synchronic functional basis in “SAP/non-
SAP” patterning at all, much as it may appear so. For discussion in the related context of accusative-
marking, see §14.3.2.1.

speaking, topic-marking of pronouns (when allowed) has a contrastive flavour, as ‘this
referent and no other’, and may occur when a speaker wishes to underscore the
uniqueness of a reference, as in (892), or when (re-)establishing a referent as a discourse
                                4286H
topic, as in (885) (where the second person dual pronoun re-establishes a set of two
               4287H

subject).

       ‘We wiped out lots of wild animals, we did.’ (NyR, MDS 067)In conditions of high topic-continuity, when same-subject resumptive pronouns alternate
only with coreferential zeros, topic-marking is almost never found.
       Topic-marking of genitive pronouns is common, as ŋó-kə̀=əə ‘1.SG-GEN=TOP’;however, this is structurally a type of headless noun phrase, hence is quite different from
the direct topic-marking of personal pronouns. Topic-marking of ablative demonstratives
is seemingly associated with a distinct function (discussed in §14.3.6.2); topic-marking of
                                                                      428H
other demonstrative pronoun types does not occur.
       In addition to marking clause-internal noun phrases, Topic marker әә veryfrequently marks Backgrounding and Framing clausal nominalizations, which occur at
the clause periphery to provide information with reference to which, or in light of which,
the information contained in a clause is construed to occur (§15.3.2) (893). Other clause-
