"Ditransitive verbs are so named because their complementation comprises two elements, adirect and an indirect object. That is, with the transitive subject included, ditransitive verbsallow three complements and because of this are sometimes termed ""trivalent"" (cf.
Matthews (1981:114). I have recorded only three ditransitive verbs in Nakkara. They arewu 'give', kurakibba ‘take from, deprive' and kuramiya ‘show, point out.
In all ditransitive clause constructions only two of the three arguments are cross-referencedon the VC. The two participants coded in the VC are the transitive subject as the (A)element and the indirect object as the (O) element. The direct object or semantic ‘theme’,that is, the object or entity involved in the transfer, is coded outside the VC, either by aCardinal pronoun (normally reserved for Core functions) or by a NP. Thus, theoretically, aditransitive verb could occur with three Cardinal pronouns in the Core layer of the clause as

" There are some interesting points to note about about transitive Imperative prefix forms.
 First, the object of a transitive Imperative construction is never distinguished for gender;
 example (25) below can mean ‘Follow him!"" or ‘Follow her!'. Where gender specification is required a Cardinal pronoun occurs, following the Imperative verb complex, as in example (27). Second, the subject of a transitive Imperative is distinguished for gender
 only where (A) is Unit-Augmented and (O) is Minimal. Finally, as with transitive indicative
 PP forms, number and person specification breaks down where four or more participants
are involved. The two forms /nginba/ and /banba/ cover a range of PP combinations. Theprefix /nginba/ indicates any non-Minimal subject called to act on any first person non-Minimal object and similarly, /banba/ indicates any non-Minimal subject called to act on any
third person non-Minimal object (see gloss, example (29)). This situation of under-specification is even more widespread in the transitive Hortative prefix forms tabled at5.4.2.2.b. below.","[228, 229]"

" Pronominal affixes are characteristic of Nakkara and other prefixing non-Pama Nyungan languages. Principal grammatical functions are not coded as nominal case affixes, as we find in the bulk of Australian languages, but as bound pronominal affixes (usually prefixes) onto a verbal predicate referred to as the verb-complex. Many nominals (a word class including nouns, adjectives, pronouns and demonstratives) can also be used predicatively and then occur with pronominal affixes. There are a handful of non-pronominal affixes,
 some of which are inflectional and some derivational. They never code grammatical functions, but add semantic specification, usually locational (see 4.7.).",[101]

 A basic transitive clause consists of a single transitive verb-complex. The Pronominal prefix of this verb-complex codes both transitive subject (A) and transitive object (O).",[403]
"
When we look at structures where the core participants are not coreferential we begin to see
some of the constructions where partial coreferentiality surfaces, and possible subdivisionsemerge. In (106) for example we see simple peripheral coordination between three VCs,but the translation to English of the relation between the second and third VC requiresrelativisation.   Similarly, in (108)        and (109)    we see verbal complements   that in otherlanguages usually require some degree of embedding or reduction.
Partial coreferentiality has most scope where one or both of the verbs invoived in the nexus
is transitive. In these circumstances the transitive object of one verb may be coreferential
with the subject of another and it is no longer just subject coreferentiality at issue. Withintransitive-intransitve constructions a different kind of partial coreferentiality emerges.
Although the core participants are not coreferential, the set of participants involved in thetwo actions can be identical, as in the following example where the subject of the first
clause is ‘she and I' (1UAf) and the subject plus Oblique of the second clause form thesame set. (IUAf = 1M + 3Mf).",[439]

 A quick review of the terms used and their manifestation in Nakkara verb complexes’ follows for ease of reference. Inner-core participants are of course the intransitive subject (S), the transitive subject (A) and the transitive object (O). These are coded as a pronominal prefix on all verb complex forms. There are three tense parameters in Nakkara, Pre- contemporary tense (PC/T), Contemporary tense (C/T) and Future tense (FUT). Tense is coded by a verbal suffix and the form of the suffix depends on the conjugation of the verb.",[420]
"In simple word-forms, the domain of stress in Nakkara is not the word as such but themorpheme, usually the root morpheme. It makes sense in a language with such a vast arrayof prefixes, to distinguish the root of a word with primary stress placement. Verbal andnominal prefixes and suffixes, although morphemes in their own right are not assignedprimary stress. (Monosyllabic verb-complexes are somewhat of an exception in this regard.",[56]

"3.3.4.2.   Selective    Topic    Pronouns A pronominal stem with the suffix /+ma/ is termed a Selective Topic pronoun. Members of this paradigm can be used to introduce a new topic to the discourse, or to refer to a selective set of participants functioning as a topic. The Selective Topic pronoun codes only coreparticipants. The associated grammatical function is usually reference to a subject (A) or (S), but reference to an object (O) is also found.

Under the heading of Nakkara Verb Morphology we introduce discussion and analysis ofvarious components of the verb complex (or VC), a word-form characteristic of languages
of this type. The VC differs from standard verb forms (as e.g. in English) in that the coreparticipant/s in a clause must be coded as an inflectional prefix to the verb stem. Tense (as
in English verb forms) is coded as suffix. Thus, in its simplest guise the Nakkara VC‘consists of a nuclear verb-root, tense suffix and pronominal prefix (PP) coding coreparticipants:

          PP and the syntactic functions associated with the
An intransitive verb has a relatively simple PP form coding only one argument. Inintransitive verbs a single core participant is identified in the PP as the intransitive subject(S). Outer-core and peripheral functions associated with an intransitive verb are never
 coded within the structure of the VC; they occur independently as NPs or Oblique
 pronouns.
A transitive verb generally has a more complex PP form which codes two arguments. The
 two associated core participants of transitive verbs are the transitive subject (A) and the
 transitive object (O). In Nakkara the inclusion and ordering of (A) and (O) marking in the PP is the subject of intricate morphological         analysis, discussed in detail in 5.3,Identification of Core Participants.
 With ditransitive verbs, only two of the three participants involved are coded pronominally within the VC. The subject (A) and the ‘implicated’ (cf. McKay (1975:253)) or second participant (coded as (O)) are identified as core participants. The middle object or theme
 (the thing, person or information transferred) is coded outside the VC as an independent
 nominal or by the Cardinal (core) pronoun, and never by an Oblique pronoun. The example
  following shows a typical ditransitive verb in context.  (3)     a)      Namurakka ngabanawuna Milak Wamud.
                  namurakka         nga    =bana +wu        -na       Milak          Wamud

                  I gave the goose to Milak and Wamud.          b)      *namurakka       ki     +wuna     Milak         Wamud

  Thus the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs is reflected in the morpholo
   of the VC, not by the form of the verb-root but by distinctive Pronominal Prefix forms.

   Analysis of PP form is given in 5.2 and 5.3. There are some morphological componen

   change accordingly. There are no productive mechanisms in Nakkara for augmenting the

Another tense-related slot within the verb complex is that immediately following the
pronominal prefix elements. This component indicates the status of the action denoted by
the verb. Specifically, an event or action which has not occurred is for our purposes termed
                                                                                      of the

affirmative parameter. It also occurs with various negative and subjunctive parameters. The
irrealis component is, nevertheless, discussed separately in 5.4.1.
The frame of reference used for indicating tense by suffix in Nakkara is interesting. The
non-future    tense   parameter    has    two    formal    categories,       Contemporary       andPre-Contemporary.      These two tense morphemes each have two distinct frames ofreference. The semantic interpretation of tense morphemes depends entirely upon whether
 an action or event occurred today or before today. The demarcation is determined logically,
 by the event of sunrise. Non-future tense distinctions are set out in the diagram below, where X and Y represent a given tense suffix:                                           TODAY             BEFORE TODAY     CONTEMPORARY                        now                      yesterday,              Xx

  Thus, an event or action which occurred, for example, yesterday (or a few days ago  would be marked with the same tense morpheme as something happening or being done  now. Similarly, my chopping of wood earlier today would be expressed with the same

person, number and gender oppositions. (see 4.2.ff)In this grammar, all members of independent pronoun paradigms are analysed as compositeforms. A pronoun consists minimally of a pronominal               stem and a suffix. The stem
identifies the person, number and gender of the referent/s and a suffix assists in identifying
the function of the pronoun. (see 4.3.)

3.3.4.1.   Cardinal     Pronouns
Cardinal pronouns are the most widely functional of the three paradigms. They consist of apronominal stem with the suffix /+bba/. (Formal properties are discussed in some detail in4,3. to 4.3.1.3.)
Cardinal pronouns are unique among independent pronominal types on two counts. First,any member of the paradigm can function within the bounds of a given clause construction(as indicator of ‘core participant/s), or independently. of it (as in abbreviated response to aquestion, e.g. Who's going? or Who did it?) Second, Cardinal pronouns can occur inpredicative possessive constructions. The pronoun occurs as a nominal stem (indicatingpossessor) with an Attributive pronominal prefix, which cross-references the thing/s“possessed. (See 4.5.1.3.)Cardinal pronouns function within the clause as independent indicators of the coreparticipants.   They   are optional reinforcement      for the pronominal     forms   coded asPronominal Prefix (PP) on the Verb-Complex          (VC). Depending on the transitivity of aclause, a clause-internal Cardinal pronoun can function as an intransitive subject (S), atransitive subject (A) or a transitive object (O). In most Australian languages, variation in |form reflects the different grammatical functions. In Nakkara the Cardinal form does notchange.","[112, 113]"
"3.3.   NominalsAccording to both formal and functional criteria it is necessary to have a rather large Nominal word class in Nakkara. Nominals are of three types: nouns, adjectives and deictics, although the division between nouns and adjectives is rather fluid. The three types
 are drawn together as a class on the basis of their function as referents for all manner of objects and entities, their functional distribution within the clause and their relative
 similarity in inflected form.",[105]
"  In 7.2. we look at the set of Interrogative and Indefinite words in Nakkara. Although this
  section might have been placed within the context of sentence types in a syntax chapter,
 they are included at this point because many of them are locational and temporal in nature
  and therefore relate to the spatio-temporal coordinates introduced in 7.2.
_ Section 7.3. consists of discussion of Particles in Nakkara. We distinguish two particle
  types, clause-modifying (discussed in 7.3.1. to 7.3.3.) and predicate-modifying (discussed
  in 7.3.4. as Adjuncts). Clause-modifying particles include Connectives, which can serve as “introductory as well as clause linking devices and Mood particles, which can affect the
  form of the verb-complex. Adjuncts occur as outer-core operators within a clause and  supply information about the semantic links between participants (core operators) and their ’ actions. These include what we traditionally call Adverbs of Manner as well as other  adverbial-like forms.             .
  7.1. Spatio-Temporal         Qualifiers  The term ‘spatio-temporal qualifier’ is used to refer to a class of word that operates clause-
  peripherally and provides information relevent to the spatial/locational or temporal
   coordinates of utterance. (Some locational qualifiers have adnominal function in addition to
   their peripheral adverbial function; both functions are discussed in this chapter.) There are
   no formal criteria for membership of this class and individual forms are said to belong
   solely on the basis of the abovementioned functional requirement. If formal distinctions
   were made within the class we would have to postulate a whole range of formal types in
   addition to the non-inflecting morphologically simple qualifiers that typify ‘spatio-temporal
   qualifiers’ and ‘adverbials' in many languages. Accepting functional criteria instead allows

7.1.1.   Locational    QualifiersLocational Qualifiers are a class of word that functions adverbally, and in some cases alsoadnominally, to give specific locational reference to a given object or entity, or to events,processes and activities referred to or spoken about. Locational qualifiers are deictic in thesense that they ‘relate utterances to the spatio-temporal co-ordinates of the act of utterance’
(Lyons, (1977:636), but they are functionally (if not always formally) distinct from someof the nominal deictics.
Nominal deictics in Nakkara include Personal Pronouns and Demonstratives.(See 3.3.4.and 3.3.3. respectively.) Personal Pronouns and Demonstrative Pronouns give specific
‘reference to nominal heads only. Locational qualifiers, which, in a functional sense include
Demonstrative Adverbs and Derived Demonstratives, are not limited in scope to associated
NPs (i.e. persons and objects), but can give spatial information about whole clauses,
including events, processes and activities being talked about or referred to. The
Demonstrative Adverbs and Derived Demonstratives, while functioning like locationalqualifiers as peripheral elements of a clause are classed with other demonstratives on thebasis of shared Demonstrative stems (see.Table 3.3.3.).","[288, 289, 290]"

"3.1. Word       Classes
There are five word classes in Nakkara. Verbs and nominals constitute the two major, openclasses of words. Spatio-temporal qualifiers, particles and interjections are smaller closedsets. These word-classes have the following functional properties:Verbs   refer to actions, events, activities and some states and function as the nucleus of averbal predicate. A verb-root occurs as the nucleus of a verb-complex. (See 5.1. to 5.1.3.for details). Because major grammatical relations are coded within the verb-complex, it canoccur in isolation as a sentential unit. In other circumstances the verb-complex is supportedby a range of independent word-forms.",[102]
"Nakkara and Ndjébbana also have a class of auxiliary-like finite verb-complexes which, i
addition to their main verb function, can be called on to code several types of imperfectivaspect    and also     adverbial-like      motion     and directional       specification.     Unlike     somsurrounding languages such as Kunbarlang and Kunwinjku there is no productive nowincorporation in the verb complex and no glottal stop in the phonemic inventory of Nakkarand Ndjébbana? .

Certainly, more detaileclassificatory work needs to be done in the area and greater attention paid to structural features in addition tlexical counts.",[23]
"
 The Oblique pronoun occurs most frequently as an ""indirect object"" with verbs (see 8.2. below). It can, however occur as a benefactive pronoun following nominals, and in this function is similar to the possessive constructions exemplified above in that it forms a
 verbless predicate/comment, as in the two examples following:

Chapter 8. These remaining structures are the spatio-temporal peripheral operators, the

link clauses to one another and trigger mood and modality variables within the clause. The

  Looking first at the positional nawaya ‘outside’, ‘aside’, 'in the clear’ we sce that the

That is, nawaya either follows the verb   (e.g. Djina nawaya ‘he-stood outside/ in the clear’, or it occurs peripheral to a NP+nayang  construction. (In (7b) below nawaya could precede the NP+nayana construction.) It is   therefore possible that a relationship of ""contact"" with the NP is established with the post-

"Nominals refer to persons, places and things and to attributes of these referents. Manynominal forms can occur as predicate nuclei; and generally, nominals can function as nounphrase heads, modifiers or predicates. Within a given clause, nominals can function ascore, outer-core or peripheral elements. The terms ‘core' and ‘peripheral’ are used in thesense of Dixon (1980:294): ‘Those NPs that must be included in a sentence if it is to have acomplete sense are said to be in core function - these are intransitive subject, transitivesubject and transitive object’. The term ‘outer-core' is borrowed from Morphy (1983:81).",[102]
