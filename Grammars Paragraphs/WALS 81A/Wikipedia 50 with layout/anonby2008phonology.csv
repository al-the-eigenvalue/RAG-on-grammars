"10.1.1 Constituent order
In Anonby (2005:8–13), constituent order in Mambay is detailed, and the effects of
changes in order are also examined. In the present study, a basic summary is provided.",[448]
"In Mambay, the basic (unmarked) order of major constituents in verbal clauses is rigidly
SVO (subject–verb–object).       tí4gérêm     %á%4zí     túrà              the women sowed millet

In a verbal clause with two objects, one object is typically a patient and the other a
recipient. Two strategies are available in such situations, and in both cases, the more
salient object in the discourse follows the other object. If the more salient object is a
patient, it simply follows the recipient:       Ø     híí           mí      sò lá            he/she/it gave me an axe
       3:PFV give:PFV      1SG.OBJ axeIf the more salient object is a recipient, it is introduced after the patient with the

       3:PFV give:PFV      axe   to 1SG.OBJIn both cases, object pronouns (6.1.3.1) are used for a pronominal recipient.","[448, 449]"
"10.1 Clauses
The following aspects of clause structure are covered in this section: constituent order
(10.1.1), clause and clause constituent particles (10.1.2), verbless clauses (10.1.3) and
single-word utterances (10.1.4).",[448]
"Secondly, unlike other morphological classes, usage of ideophones varies considerably
from one person to another, and outside the context of discourse, speakers of the
language are often unable to determine the meaning of ideophones used by people from
other clans or villages (cf. Childs 2001:67–70). In the ideophonic lexicon, both the
words used as well as the meanings of these words are variable among speakers. And
even where people concur on the form and meaning of a given ideophone, they may
differ regarding its admissibility in the various host word classes (adverb, adjective, noun
and verb; see especially 8.5.6). Numerous speakers of Mambay have been involved in
this study of ideophones; however, in order to cope with the complexity of the
information, this chapter relies on data gathered from the researcher’s primary language
assistant.",[403]
"Contrast between r and g
The preceding discussion shows that a partial complementarity exists between the
extensions 4ri and 4gi as well as between members of the extension pairs 4ri / 4r and 4gi /
4g. It is therefore reasonable to consider whether the extensions 4r and 4g may also be
partially complementary. However, this is not the case; the distribution of 4r and 4g is
contrastive in some word pairs. Examples which show this are as follows:       sùg             sink
       sùr             put in order
       cf. súú         think, crush       zàg             refuse, divorce
       zàr             tread
       cf. zàà         cross7.3 Verb word morphology
Verb words, along with subject pronouns (6.1.2, 7.4) and expansions of verb forms (7.6),
are fundamental in furnishing morphological structures which communicate the functions
of verbal inflection in Mambay (7.4). In the present section, affixational possibilities are
catalogued (7.3.1) and the tonal behaviour of the verb word is discussed (7.3.2.2.3).
Elements of verb classification (7.3.2) and are then followed by a description of the
morphology of irregular verbs (7.3.3).",[332]
"Most Mambay speakers are proficient in at least one other language. The most common
languages of multilingualism are (in order of decreasing frequency) Fulfulde (the
language of the Fulbe), French and Mundang. Proficiency in Hausa and Arabic, two
other languages of multilingualism, is limited to a small minority of men (Hamm
2001:12).",[37]
"Chapter 10 serves to introduce the structure of clauses and clause combinations. The
section on clause structure, which comes first, deals with constituent order, clause and
clause constituent particles and verbless clauses; independent utterances other than
clauses are also considered. The section on clause combinations then concentrates on
strategies of coordination and subordination, giving special attention to conjunctions and
particles.",[44]
"Methodological issues
Rather than attempting an exhaustive analysis of ideophones in Mambay, the present
chapter provides a basic descriptive framework for an intricate but indistinctly structured
                                            385
area of the language. The study of ideophones in Mambay is problematic, and several
methodological comments are in order.","[402, 403]"
"An underlying H melody for 4na is harder to defend, but should also be considered. As
in the previous hypothesis, affixation with HL nouns would be straightforward.        ûl     +      4ná                     ûl4ná               dividing (something)

nouns would have to be considered LH in order to pursue an account in which 4na was
H-toned:       verbal noun            verbal noun w/ explicit object
       fòó                    fòò …                               spying (something)
       gbuFg                  gbùg …                              throwing (something)With LH verbal nouns, it is possible that Meeussen’s rule (see Meeussen 1965:110 and
Goldsmith 1984) causes a H-toned 4ná suffix to be realized as L after H:       fòó     +      4ná                    fòó4nà               spying (something)
       gbuFg   +      4ná                    gbuFg4nà             throwing (something)The major weakness of this explanation is that such a process has not been observed
elsewhere in the language (merging of H tones is the norm in other phonological words;
for an example, look at inalienable noun-pronoun constructions in 5.3.4.2.4.1).",[248]
"10.2.2.2 Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clauses are used to express a range of adverbial information pertaining to a
main clause. Attested functions include time, purpose, concession and condition. The
following adverbializers are used introduce these adverbial clauses:       kà              when, if; and then, before, so that, in order to
       kò              when, if

                         nàá (relativizer))As the subsequent discussion shows, all of the adverbializers are found clause-initially.",[460]
"At the end of this study, a collection of five texts is transcribed and interlinearized. These
texts have been selected from a variety of genres—song, proverb, legend (account of
origins), and fable—in order to illustrate a range of morphological, syntactic and
discourse structures. In addition, there are two appendices: Appendix 1 provides an
                                             27
inventory of inalienable possession paradigms, and Appendix 2 presents conjugations of
verbal inflection as it patterns with contrastive tonal verb classes.","[44, 45]"
"In order to maintain symmetry with Q, it is appropriate to interpret [)w] as the unit
consonant Nw. The resulting analysis of Q and Nw as contrastive units accords well with
descriptions of several other Kebi-Benue languages (Ubels and Ubels 1984:20; Elders
1995:1, 2000:23, 2006; see also ambiguous data in Ruelland 1992:30).",[66]
"After transitive verb stems ending in a vowel or the nasal consonants m and 7, no vowel
is appended.       mú          Qàá                      [you (sg.)] finish (something)!

       2SG:OPT     wait:OPT7.4.2.2 Subjunctive constructions with kà
Optative verb forms are also found in subjunctive constructions with the adverbializer kà
‘when, and then’ (10.2.2.2). Semantically, a purpose clause (‘so that, in order to’) results
from the combination of kà and the Optative verb form. The structure of the Optative in
this context is the same as that found in main clauses (7.4.2.1).",[373]
"The present study grapples with the morphological classification of ideophones in
Mambay and provides a description of their structure. This focus, coupled with the
richness of the topic in general, has precluded a satisfactory treatment of related topics
such as the semantics of ideophones, the relationship of structural features to perceived
                                           384
realities, and the role of ideophones in discourse.        However, a couple of general
comments are in order.","[401, 402]"
"9.3 Prepositions
Although members of several word classes in Mambay are used for locational functions,
prepositions are the only class devoted to these functions. True prepositions, which are
found as heads of prepositional phrases, constitute a closed word class of only seven
items. Of these, two appear to be borrowed. Mambay prepositions are, in alphabetical
order:       bèè             without
       háá ~ háá       until, up to, all the way to (cf. Fulfulde haa, Mundang há$á)
       lâ’             like, as
       má              with, and, by, during
       sáà             inside, in
       sé’ ~ séQ       except, only, not until (cf. Fulfulde sey)
       yâg             to, forAll seven prepositions are monosyllabic. While the commonly used preposition má
‘with, and, by, during’ is comprised of a light syllable, the other prepositions are
comprised of a heavy syllable (cf. 2.4.3).",[442]
"As shown in the table above, the third person singular object pronoun 4 `rú is also attested
as 4 `wú; the variant 4 `wú is associated with informal speech.       Ø     zóò4rú                                he/she/iti greeted him/her/itj

      3:PFV greet:PFV-3SG.OBJThe first-and-second person plural object pronoun also has two variants, both of which
are common: a phonologically independent morpheme zìnzá and a suffix 4zíná. Either
form may be used with no change in meaning. Variation between the forms is likely
sociolinguistic rather than linguistic, reflecting a process of contraction that is taking
place; however, the precise factors influencing usage have not been identified (see also
7.3.1.5 for discussion of the formally similar 1&2PL reflexive suffixes).       Ø        zóó       zìnzá                   he/she/it greeted us (incl.)

6.1.3.2 Reflexive object pronouns
Members of a set of reflexive object pronouns are used whenever the object of a simple
clause is co-referential with its subject. Similar to what is found in many other African
languages (Watters 2000:213), reflexive object pronouns in Mambay are composed of the
noun )ínù ‘body, self’ and an inalienable possessive pronoun (6.1.4.2). Reflexive object
pronouns are as follows:                                  Reflexive object pronouns
                               1SG          )íní

       2SG     greet:PFV      body:1SG.POSSLike reflexive verb suffixes (7.3.1.5), reflexive object pronouns reduce the number of
semantic participants in a transitive verb construction. However, they achieve this using
different strategies: while reflexive suffixes result in the detransitivization of a transitive
verb (7.3.2.1.2), reflexive object pronouns satisfy transitivity requirements by supplying
the transitive verb with an object. The detransitivization strategy is only moderately
                                              277
productive and is often accompanied by semantic shift (7.3.2.1.2), but the use of reflexive
objects is fully productive.       reflexive verb suffix:       mì gìì4ní                                   I consented

"The syntactic distribution of TAM adverbs is heterogeneous: they are found before
subject pronouns, after verb words, in both of these positions and, in one case (%âh ‘go

functions are associated with each position.",[381]
"However, in Mambay the audience of a command may also be the first or the third person
(sample descriptions for which an imperative function has been described for all
pronominal persons are Robertson 1934:320–30, Lakoff 1968:172–6; Roberts 1990:369
and Mounce 1994:143–8; cf. also Palmer 2001:81, who discusses the theoretical

implications of such a system). For forms in which the first person is a speaker, orders
are given to oneself (the first person singular) or a group of which one is a part (first
person plural and 1&2 person forms); for the singular, this has the force of resolve (“let
me…,” “I must…”), and for the plural, exhortation (“let us…,” “we must…”),
respectively. For the third person (singular or plural), the Optative expresses the idea that
an audience which is not being directly addressed must do something; this carries an
obligative (“he/she/it must…”) force. For all three persons, the formal expression of
imperative constructions is equivalent; there is no formally discrete second person
conjugation (cf. Dimmendaal 2000:175, Watters 2000:203, who note that in most
languages the subject pronoun is omitted for second person imperatives).","[369, 370]"

"7.3.1.5 Pronominal object suffixes
Three object pronouns are verb word suffixes: second person singular (7.3.1.5.1), third
person singular (7.3.1.5.2), and the 4zíná variant of the 1&2 person plural (7.3.1.5.3). In
all three cases, there is morphophonological evidence of these suffixes’ interdependence
with the verb word; such evidence is lacking for other object pronouns (6.1.3.1).",[338]
"Verbal inflection is explored in 7.4. Specifically, this section treats basic inflectional
categories, which are marked length on subject pronouns and tone on subject pronouns
and verb words. It is shown that a division between Indicative and Optative mood is
fundamental to the verb system, and Indicative verb forms are also distinguished for
realis value and aspect. Negative verb forms, which pattern differently than their
affirmative counterparts, are treated separately in 7.5.",[316]
"7.4.2.3 Subjunctive constructions with pá ‘make, do’
Finally, Optative verb forms are found in subjunctive constructions which pattern as the
object of pá ‘make, do’ (7.6.3). In this case, a periphrastic causitive construction results:                                            356

Five of the six basic inflectional categories (7.4) have corresponding negative forms
(7.5.1). The segmental and tonal form of a verb word remains constant when it is
negated. Verbal negation is instead marked by negative particles (7.5.2), and with
Indicative verb forms, by negative subject pronouns (7.5.3). A summary of negative
verbal forms is provided in 7.5.4.","[373, 374]"
"All of the other morphemes which are part of verb words are suffixes. Basic inflectional
distinctions are expressed by the verbal plural morpheme 4zí (7.3.1.1), reflexive suffixes
(7.3.1.2) and the Perfect suffix 4rì (7.3.1.3). Other verb suffixes are the dummy object
suffix 4na (7.3.1.4), several object suffixes (7.3.1.5) and the directional suffix 4ìn / 4n` ‘to
here’ (7.3.1.6). Combinatory possibilities of verbal suffixes are listed in 7.3.1.7.",[332]
"7.4.1.1.1.1 Basic Perfective
The basic Perfective tense is used for completed events. In contrast to the Perfect and
Pluperfect (7.4.1.1.1.2, 7.4.1.1.1.3), it is unspecified regarding the consequences of an
event for a later point in time. The basic Perfective tense is the default means of marking
sequential events in narrative discourse (Anonby 2005:29–32). It is typically structured
as follows:       subject pronoun +       verb

Adverbial functions, including those which are locational, are not restricted to
prepositions. In fact, nouns and directional adverbs are more commonly used to express

independent pronoun. For emphatic subject pronouns, the independent pronoun precedes
the basic pronoun; for other emphatic pronoun sets, the independent pronoun follows it.

In Mambay, there is a small class of specifiers. Three demonstratives and an indefinite
article make up this class. Members of this class are used to situate participants within a
discourse, and have in common a restricted distribution: they are only found at the very
end of a noun phrase (5.14) headed by a linked (5.2.2) noun.       kâg        náá                              this chicken

long-distance anaphoric demonstrative (9.2.2), and an indefinite article (9.2.3). The long-
distance anaphoric demonstrative may be used with either of the proximity
demonstratives (9.2.2), but other combinations are not permitted.","[438, 439]"
"5.7.1 Male/generic participant nouns
Male/generic participant noun constructions are formed by inserting the noun páà ‘man,
father, owner’ in the possessed-noun position of a possessive construction. The
prototypical usage of páà as an alienable noun is that of ownership:       páà )ígà                                   owner
       man:LF thingAlthough páà is typically used for male referents, and Mambay speakers consistently
give the gloss ‘man, father,’ it may also be used generically:       páà bîn                                    another person (male or female)

Female participant noun constructions may be formed in one of two ways: by inserting
the noun vínà ‘woman’ or its respect form (cf. 5.8.2) tí4vínà in the possessed-noun
position of a possessive construction; or by attaching an augmentative/female prefix tí4
(cf. 5.8.2) to a noun.       (tí4)vín sûm4ná                      = tí4sûm4ná                 female

associated with more formal speech or used to focus on the female identity of the
participant.","[235, 236, 237]"

10.1.2.3 The negative particle yá
Negation is always signalled by the clause-final negative particle yá along with some
additional indicator. For negation of an equivalence clause, yá is found in conjunction
with a third person negative non-Perfective pronoun híì (6.1.2.6) in initial subject
position.       híì          wáà           yá               he/she/it is not the chief

hìí (6.1.2.5) is used directly before yá.       wáà     hìí           yá                    the chief is not there / there is no chief

       chief   beThe negative particle yá is most commonly found with verbs (7.6.1.1.1) and, like the
other Indicative particles, is found clause-finally; the marking of negation in this position
is an areal feature (Watters 2000:207). Here, yá is accompanied by a modification of the
structure of subject pronouns, which mark realis value (see 6.1.2).       míì            té’là   yá                   I am not walking / I do not walk

       1SG walk:VNObjects may also be negated: modifications in tonal and segmental structure similar to
those applied to subject pronouns signal that negation concerns an object rather than the
verb or clause. This negation has the effect of focus on the object, and indicates that the
object is different item than the one which the listener expects. In the following cases,
the object’s final syllable is lengthened and a low tone is associated with it.       mìí         kó       ígàà      yá                   I didn’t see the child

To the north of the Adamawa Massif and approximately eight hundred kilometres from
the Gulf of Guinea, the Mambay ethnic group straddles the border of Cameroon and
Chad. Members of the group, numbering about fifteen thousand, live along the Mayo
Kebbi (Kebbi River) at the point where it flows south-west from Chad toward its
confluence with the Benue River in Cameroon.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"

"Indicative verb forms are specified for Realis and Irrealis values. In contrast to Optative
forms, which are inherently irrealis and not marked for realis distinction, Indicative
Realis (7.4.1.1) and Irrealis (7.4.1.2) forms are distinguished. Formally, this distinction is
marked on the subject pronoun: Realis pronouns are short (CV), and Irrealis pronouns are
long (CVV) (6.1.2). While Realis forms signal events which have happened or are
happening, Irrealis forms signal events that have not already happened and which are not8
  In the present study, as has been common in the study of Niger-Congo generally, the term “tense” is
understood in a traditional sense: “any one of the different forms or modifications (or word-groups) in the
conjugation of a verb which indicate the different times (past, present, or future) at which the action or
state denoted by it is viewed as happening or existing, and also (by extension) the different nature of such
action or state, as continuing (imperfect) or completed (perfect)” (Oxford English Dictionary online 2007;
cf. Doke 1935:209, Dimmendaal 2000:162 and Crystal 2003:459–60). This differs from the use of the term
in Comrie (1976) and, subsequently, much of the literature (e.g. Lyons 1995:312 ff.), where event sequence
(“tense”) and the internal structure of events (“aspect”) are treated as distinct categories of verb
modification. In Mambay, there is no formal justification for such a distinction.",[356]
"7.5.4 Summary of negative verbal forms
Negative verb forms are marked with negation particles (7.5.2) and negative subject
pronouns (7.5.3). These forms are summarized in the following table:                             Negative verbal forms in Mambay                                                          verb shape and     negative

7.6 Expansions of verbal inflection
Expanded verb forms allow for functional enrichment of the categories in the basic
inflectional system. While some are formed by means of TAM indicators (7.6.1), others
are formed using possessive constructions (7.6.2) and complex inflectional constructions,
including serial and auxiliary verb constructions (7.6.3).",[377]
"Chapter 6, which is concerned with pronouns, is an appropriate transition between
chapter 5 on nouns and chapter 7, which is concerned with verbs. While, prototypically,
pronouns take the place of nominal referents, they also play an important role in the
verbal system, where they bear TAM (tense, aspect and mode) distinctions. The larger
part of the chapter is concerned with the basic categories of personal pronouns
distinguished in Mambay: subject, object and possessive pronouns. Each of these
pronoun types also has emphatic forms produced by various strategies. A final section
deals with interrogative pronouns.",[44]
"In six Mambay items in the data, the distribution of nasality is irregular: it is incomplete
within the morpheme even where it is not blocked by an obstruent or a mid vowel.       dàrmí         clay

Minimal domain of association
Nasality requires a specific minimal domain in order to associate. Minimal domains are
as follows (the first four of these five domains have already been delineated in 3.4.1):       - a nasal coda (ex. vbòm ‘divide’);
       - a long vowel (ex. záá ‘pull’);
       - a nasal(-ized) onset plus a nasal(-ized) nucleus (ex. núg ‘sleep (tr.)’);
       - a nasal(-ized) nucleus plus a nasal(-ized) coda (ex. zìr ‘gnaw’); or
       - two short vowels separated by a nasal(-ized) sonorant (ex. gùrá ‘crane’).","[126, 127]"
"The Optative and the five Indicative tenses (basic Perfective, Perfect, Pluperfect,
Imperfective and Future) are distinguished from one another by contrastive tone melodies
and by the inventory of verbal suffixes which may found with each (7.3.1). The tone
melodies associated with the possible forms of a given verb fall into six tonal sets or
classes (7.3.2.2). If the tone melody is known for the basic Perfective, Perfect and
Future, melodies for the remaining forms can be predicted. Concerning the inventory of
verbal suffixes, reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) are obligatorily found with Perfect and
Pluperfect forms of intransitive verbs, and optionally found with Future and Optative
forms of intransitive verbs. Further, the Perfect forms of transitive verbs always take the
suffix 4rì, and Imperfective forms of transitive verbs must take the dummy object suffix 4
na if there is no explicit object.",[357]
"Most commonly, interrogative pronouns co-occur with the question particle nà
(10.1.2.1). If the interrogative pronoun is the subject of the clause, it comes in the usual
subject position (before the verbal complex; see 10.1.1) and the question particle comes
at the end of the clause.       víí  Ø      húmgò nà                   who comes? / who is coming?

If the interrogative pronoun and question particle are found alone in a clause, or if the
interrogative pronoun is found in clause-final position (e.g. as an object, adverbial
complement, or predicate nominal), the pronoun and question particle form a single
