4. 1 COREGRAMMAR ANDGRAMMATlCALRELATIONS
   The basic word order of an Abun clause, like all other West Papuan Phylum languages, is
SUBJECT VERB OBJECT.
   Firstly, in regard to subjects, Andrews ( 1 985: 1 04) points out that in a great many
languages a subject grammatical relation is clearly marked by the coding features of ordinary
main clauses. For example, in English, subjects are primari ly marked by the coding feature
of preverbal position, and in some limited cases indicated by case marking and cross­
referencing. Abun subjects are similar to English because they are clearly encoded by word
order. No case-marking or other coding devices signify an Abun subject. Rather, Abun
subjects are always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately precedes the
verb.
   The direct object in an Abun transitive clause is also encoded by word order alone. The
Abun object is always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately follows the
verb, except in certain contexts where the object can be fronted (see §4.7.2).
   According to Andrews ( 1 985:69), the first step in analysing the system of grammatical
relations in a language is to identify A, S, and 0, where A is transitive subject (prototypically
an agent), S is intransitive subject (either agent or patient) and 0 is transitive object
(prototypically a patient). Typologically languages differ according to how these grammatical
relations group. Nominative/accusative systems combine A and S functions, whereas
absolutive/ergative systems combine S and 0 functions.
   On this basis, Abun is a nominative-accusative language since it combines the S and A
functions. Abun combines S and A on a syntactic level, the syntactic coding being word
order. S and A precede the verb, whereas 0 follows the verb. In an intransitive clause, a

subject (A) precedes the verb and an object (0) fol lows, as in 4.2.
   4. 1        Men      kas.
               1 PL     run

               We ran .
   4.2         Men      gwa      Isak.
               1 PL     hit      Isak
               SUBJECf VffiB     OBJECf
               We hit Isak.
   Morphologicall y the constituents of noun phrases are the same, irrespective of the
grammatical role filled by the noun phrases. In example 4.2 the subject of the transitive
clause (A) is first person plural, while an identical form is also the object (0) of 4.3 and
subject of the intransitive c lause (S) in 4. 1 . All Abun pronouns are invariant in form, whether
they refer to the subject, object or possessor. See Table 3 . 1 4 in §3.4.4 for a ful l list of
pronouns.
   4.3         Isak      gwa     men.
               Isak      hit     1 PL
               SUBJECf VffiB     OBJECf
               Isak hit us.
   Most other grammatical relations, including that of dative, are encoded by the use of
prepositions. In addition to being encoded by prepositions, word order is stil l fairly rigid. For
example, dative, where present, follows an object and precedes other prepositional phrases .
Locative phrases with the preposition m o usually fol low a l l other prepositional phrases.
   Free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases which express time or location are free from the
otherwise rigid word order of the Abun clause, with the exception that they cannot occur
preceding the direct object (see §4.4. 1 ).
   Thus, an Abun main clause consists of:
          (ADJUNCTS) SUBJECf VERB (DIRECr OBJECf) (INDIRECr OBJECf) (ADJUNCTS) (PARTICLES)
   Adj uncts include free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases and various prepositional phrases
expressing associative, instrumental, benefactive and the like. The subject is obligatory and i s
rarely elided, even in subordinate clauses. Particles may optionally occur clause-finally to
indicate polarity, aspect, modality or mood. A detailed discussion of these particles is the
subject of the chapters 6, 7 and 8 of this work.
   Objects may be topicalised by fronting. Adj uncts expressing location or time may also be
fronted and thereby precede the subject in certain contexts (see §4.7 below). Those
expressing time usually precede the subject, whereas those expressing location are only
fronted on rare occasions.

   Blake ( 1 990: 1 ) summarises some of the basic notions of relational grammar and includes
a discussion of grammatical relations that can be arranged in a hierarchy, namely subject,
object, indirect object and obliques (that is, adjuncts). Each level of the hierarchy can be
distinctly marked; for example, the presence of case marking or adpositions tends to be
associated with the oblique end of the hierarchy.
   In arranging the grammatical relations of the Abun language in a hierarchy, it can be seen
that each level is marked in a distinct way, as listed in Table 3 . 1 8 below. First, the subject is
marked by word order; it is simply preverbal. Second, the object also is marked by word
order; it is postverbal. Next, at the level of indirect object, a change in marking takes place.
Higher in the hierarchy, word order alone marks the grammatical relations, but for indirect
objects and obliques grammatical relations are marked by prepositions, with word order
taking a secondary role.","[60, 61, 62]"

10.2.3.2 COMPLEMENT-TAKING NOUNS: THOUGHTS
   Thoughts and plans may also take complements. The conceptual thought or plan may be
expressed by means of a noun phrase, having the structure of a possessive phrase. The
complements described here differ from naming complements in that the complement in
these cases always consists of a ful l clause, not j ust a single noun phrase.
   1 0.35   An wa bi        suk-jimnot i      do an wa kra         Andar kagit Lamber.
            3 sG FOC POSS NOM-think own COM 3SG FOC marry Andar from Lamber
            His particular plan (was) that he would marry Andar rather than Lamber.
    Occasionally the stative particle/verb may follow the possessive phrase as in example
1 0.36 below; however, it is more usual for this to be omitted. Sukjimnot 'thought, plan,
intention' appears to be the only Abun noun which may take complements in this way.
   1 0.36   A n hi      suk-jimnot m6        do    bere an ma          gu Lamber.
            3sG POSS NOM-think         exist COM later 3sG come kill Lamber
            His thinking was that later he would come and kil l Lamber.
172                                                                                    CHAPTER 1010.2.4 COMPLEMENT CLAUSE STRUCI1JRE IN ABUN
    When a subordinate clause is a complement, it is common for the complement to function
as the subject or object of the larger clause into which it is embedded. In Abun , complements
may function as objects of a clause and this type of complement will be described under
§ 1 O.3. However, the type of subordinate clause that has been under discussion here, those
that are identified by the complementiser do, do not function in this way.
   At this stage it may be relevant to restate the criteria that determines which constituent i s
the object i n a n Abun clause. A s stated i n §4. 1 , ""The direct object in a n Abun transitive
clause is also encoded by word order alone. Abun objects are always the constituent realised
by a noun phrase that immediately follows the verb . . . "" Since there is no case marking on
nouns, this cannot be used to identify the object. The rigid word order of the Abun language
does not allow passivisation and so this cannot serve to identify the object either. Unlike the
dative relation the object is not identified by a particular preposition. The object i s
distinguished from the subject o n the sole criteria o f word order.
   When the complementiser is used, the constituent that follows the complementiser does
not function as the direct object of the main clause. Three arguments are put forward here to
support this analysis:
   (1)     A do-clause can follow an intransitive verb.
   (2)     When the verb is transitive a do-clause can co-occur with the direct object.
   (3)     Abun word order indicates that a do-clause functions as an oblique.
   These arguments wi I I now be expanded further.","[183, 184]"
"   In example 8.35a, the garden falls within the scope of negation. Isak may not have been at
the garden. He may have done things elsewhere. In 8 .35b, the garden is outside the scope of
negation. It is contextually bound, since a construction of this nature occurs only when the
garden is being discussed. Information considered contextually free is bracketed by particles.
   In complex sentences it is clear how the scope of negation changes according to what is
bracketed. In example 8 . 36, when the bracketing changes from the whole sentence to the
complement, the meaning is significantly different.
   8.36 a.    Moses yo      ki     gado     do         an      kra         su    Barbarina 0       nde.
              Moses NEG say earlier that 3sG marry with Barbarina                         again    NEG
              Moses did not say earlier that he would marry Barbarina again.
         b. Moses ki gada        do     an yo     kra    su    Barbarina a                        nde.
            Moses say earlier that 3sG NEG marry with Barbarina again                             NEG
            Earlier Moses said that he would not marry Barbarina again.
     In a similar way the Chadic language, Hausa, syntactically marks the scope of negation by
the use of two negative particles. In that language these particles can move around to bracket
the subject, the predicate or other parts of the sentence. Examples are found in Schachter
( 1 985 :60). However word order is not rigid as it is in Abun. In Hausa, both particles can
move to bracket the constituent that is being negated and thereby very neatly indicate the
scope as well as the focus of negation. Abun ' s use of the linked particles is not as flexible:
because for example, the subject can never be surrounded by the linked pair of particles.
However the subject may be included in the scope of negation as discussed in the next
section.
1 44                                                                                       CHAPTER 8
8.5.2 NARROWINGlHE SCOPE OF NEGAll0N
   Example 8.33 above does not specify which of the components within the predicate are
being negated. Was it not a wild pig killed? Was it not a killing? Was it not at that location?
All of these components are within the scope of negation . To know which component is
being negated one needs to refer to the context of the discussion. Since negative sentences are
rarely said in isolation, that part which is being negated is usually known from the context.
   In English several strategies are used to narrow the scope of negation to the elements of
the sentence or predicate that the speaker wants to negate. These include the use of
phonological devices such as emphatic stress, or syntactic devices such as cleft constructions.
So, for example, the use of intonation to stress components of the sentence is a way to negate
a constituent as in, 'Isak did not eat the RICE (but the fish)' . Or, ' Isak did not EAT the rice
(but he just swallowed it) ' . Alternatively, or in addition, syntactic features may be used to
negate a constituent. Topicalisation, for example, is used in English, 'It was not the rice that
Isak ate ' .
   In the same way, Abun, like English, has some syntactic techniques that enable u s to
focus on the negation of a certain part of the sentence. Essentially the constituent to be
negated needs to be bracketed by yo and nde. In order to achieve this the predicate needs to
be transformed so that only one constituent is bracketed by the negative particles. As a result
of limiting the scope of negation, elements within the predicate are topicalised or relativised.
The scope can also be narrowed by a second use of the particle, yo.
   Firstly, by topicalising elements of the predicate the scope of negation is narrowed.
Topicalisation of an element removes such an element from the scope of negation, thereby
reducing the number of possibilities to which the negation may apply. So, for example, if the
wild pig in example 8 .37a, is topicalised, it becomes 8.37b, meaning that either the action
(killing) or the location fall within the scope of negation. If, then, the location is likewise
topicalised, as in 8.37c, the result is that either the action or the object falls within the scope of
negation. Also it is possible to front both the object and the location, thereby effectively
narrowing the scope of the negation to the action alone. Thus, in 8 .37d, the wild pig near the
Nai river is under discussion and Isak did not kill it; he must have done something else to it.
   8.37 a.     Isak yo      gu    nok         rno   syur    Na i de         nde.
               Isak NEG     kill wild.pig LOC water Nai           bank      NEG
               Isak did not kill a wild pig by the Nai river.
          b. Nok        ne    Isak yo      gu     rno syur Na i de                  nde.
             wild. pig DEf Isak NEG kill LOC water Nai bank                         NEG
             That wild pig Isak did not kill by the Nai river.
          c.   Mo    syur    Na i de        Isak yo        gu    nok         nde.
               LOC   water Nai bank Isak             NEG kill    wild.pig    NEG
               By the Nai river, Isak did not kill a wild pig.
          d. Nok       ga    rno syur Na i de            ne Isak yo           gu       nde.
             wild.pig REI... LOC water Nai bank DEf Isak NEG kill NEG
             (Concerning) a wild pig that was by the Nai river, Isak did not kil l (it).
   Secondly, in order to narrow the scope of negation to the modifier of a noun head of the
subject, the predicate of the sentence may be relativised to become embedded within the
subject position, with the modifier becoming the negated predicate. Take, for example, the
NEGATION                                                                                         1 45modifier of the head of the noun phrase, rnwa 'man y ' , in example 8 . 3 8a. Sentential negation
of 8.38a is shown in 8 . 3 8b. But to narrow the scope of negation to the constituent, rnwa, a
structural change is made to form 8.38c, where the item to be negated, rnwa alone is
bracketed by yo and nde. To achieve this, the predicate of 8.38b is relativised to become part
of the subject and rnwa then behaves as a predicate and can be negated with the linked pair of
negative particles, as in 8 .38c.
   8 . 3 8 a.   Pa         rnwa    it             rno   kelas gri.
                children  many go.up LOC grade three
                Many children went up to grade three.          b. Pa        rnwa     yo    it      rno kelas gri                    nde.
             children  many     NEG go.up LOC grade three                      NEG
             Many children did not go up to grade three.
          c.    Pa         ga     it        rno     kelas       gri     ne yo      rnwa   nde.
                children   who rise LOC grade        three              DEI' NEG
                                                                       many NEG
                The children who went up to grade three were not many.
   Finally, the scope can also be narrowed by the use of yo a second time in the sentence to
intensify or emphasise the negation thereof; compare example 8.39a to 8.39b, 8.39c and
8.39d. This second use of yo is limited to occasions when it precedes the verb rno 'to exist'
   8.39 a.      Men yo      ku      an    rno            nde.
                1 PL NEG meet 3sG exist                  NEG
                1 . We have not ever met him.
                2. We have never met him.
          b. Men ku       an yo       rno                nde.
             1 PL meet 3sG NEG exist                     NEG
             1 . We have met him, never.
             2. We have never met him.
          c.    Men yo      ku         an     nde.
                1 PL NEG   meet 3SG           NEG
                We have not met him.
          d. Men yo         ku      an yo       rno              nde.
                1 PL NEG meet 3sG NEG exist                      NEG
                1 . We have not met him, never.
                2. We have NEVER met him.
   In Abun the use of topicalisation, fronting and relativisation of predicates or part thereof,
or a second use of yo to narrow the scope of negation (to focus on or emphasise one
constituent of a sentence) is not very common. In most cases the constituent being negated is
understood from the context, obviating the need for such constructions.
                                           CHAPIER 9                                     RELATIVE CLAUSES
   In this section subordinate clauses of the type known as relative clauses will be discussed.
In Abun, relative clauses can be divided into the two basic types, restrictive and non­
restrictive. The restrictive type is by far the more common and more flexible grammatical
structure and so it will be discussed in more detail here. This discussion will attempt to show
that the Abun relative clause utilises a relative conjunction together with a strategy called a
gap strategy, in order to relati vise various grammatical relations.
   By using a different conjunction, a non-restrictive relative clause as well as a third type
which could be described as an indefinite relative clause are also possible in the Abun
language. These will be described in detail below.","[155, 156, 157, 158]"
"
10    These conjunctions are described in detail in Chapter I I .
II    See Chapter 5 where the possessive marker bi is analysed as a possessive linker.
12    This is not to rule out the possibility that the relative conjunction gata may not be a true linker.
      However its overall behavioural charateristics indicate that it is a conjunction and not just a
      particle found only in relative clauses.
152                                                                                             CHAPTER 99.5 RELATIVECLAUSE FDRMAnON STRAlEGY
   In any relative construction, the noun phrase that is denoted 'head' holds a gramm atical
relation in both clauses of that construction, namely in the main clause and in the relative
clause. Cross-linguistically, it appears that there is more significant variation in encoding the
grammatical relation of the head in the embedded clause, than is found in the main clause
(Comrie 1 989: 147, 1 53). Comrie distinguishes four major strategies for encoding the head
within the relative clause. These he terms non-reduction, pronoun retention, relative pronoun
and gap (Comrie 1989: 147). Non-reduction means ""that the head noun appears in full,
unreduced form, in the embedded sentence, in the normal position and/or with the normal
case marking"". With pronoun retention, the head noun is represented in the embedded clause
as a pronoun. When a relative pronoun is used, it is in clause-initial position and it is marked
for case. With any of these three strategies the role of the head noun within the relative clause
is overtly indicated ( 1 989 : 1 5 1 ). The fourth strategy, however, does not provide any overt
indication at all of the role of the head within the relative clause. The head is actually omitted
from the relative clause. For this reason it is called a gap strategy. A study of Abun relative
clause structure shows that Abun uses the fourth strategy in Comrie' s list, the gap strategy.
   Abun does not make any overt reference to the head noun within the restricting clause.
The embedded clause does not retain a pronoun referring to the head noun, nor is there a
relative clause pronoun which specifically refers to the head noun, nor is there a full noun
phrase inside the embedded clause. The head is omitted in the restricting clause, thereby
creating a gap. But since the restricting clause does not contain any reference to the head
noun, how can one know what grammatical relation the relativised argument holds?
  As explained in Chapter 4, Abun does not actually mark the case of nouns. The
gramm atical relations of Subject, Object and so on are normally marked by word order.
Therefore, it is the word order of the relative clause and the location of the gap created by the
omission of the head that provide the clues for encoding the gramm atical relation of the head.
For example:
     9.22      M e mu gu y e        gato man siri     su    men bi     nggon.
               I PL go kill person RFL do wrong with I PL POSS woman
               We (will) go (and) kill the person who has slept with our woman (woman
               from our clan).
   In example 9.22 above the restricting clause following gato contains no subject. There is a
gap between the relative conjunction gato and the verb phrase man siri 'do wrong' ,
indicating that the embedded clause contains no overt subject. Therefore the grammatical
relation of the head ye 'person' within the restricting clause is subject. Compare this example
with the relation of the relativised argument in example 9.23:
     9.23      Ii nut-bot            ye      galo ji         i-wa                ne.
               I SG thought-about person RFL            I SG happY-TRs           DEY
               I thought about the person that I liked.
   Here there is a gap after the verb iwa 'like', even though the transitive suffix -wa indicates
that this verb is a transitive verb. Therefore in this case the head ye 'person' is interpreted as
having the grammatical relation of object in the relative clause. 1 3
13    It is to be noted here that this clause also contains a determiner which will be discussed i n §9.S. 1
      below. The determiner i s more common when the head has the grammatical relation o f object.
RELATNE CLAUSES                                                                                1539.5. 1 THE ROLE OF mE DETERMINER
   It was said in §9. 1 above that some restncl1ve relative clauses are closed with a
determiner. The demonstrative pronouns re 'this' and ne 'that' have several functions in
Abun and one of these is to behave as a determiner. Unlike English determiner usage it is not
obligatory to use the determiner after a noun in Abun.","[163, 164, 165]"

10.2.5.2 SYNTACTIC RESTRICTIONS
   Since the predicates 'want' and 'believe' cannot allow negative raIsmg due to lexical
restrictions, the only other predicate eligible for negative raising in Abun would be nut
'think' . Examples of negative raising with this predicate are not found in Abun. The
following examples show a complement clause containing a negative as in example 10.46
and then an unacceptable sentence where this negative has been 'raised' in 10.47.
     1 0.46    Ii nut do ji           yo ku        nan gro 0    nde.

               I thought that I would not see you (ever) again.
     1 0.47     *Ii yo        nut     do ji       ku     nan gro            0        nde.
                I so NEG think CX)M I so meet 2so eye                       again    NEG
                I did not think that I would (ever) see you again.
   Example 1 0.47 is unacceptable on syntactic grounds. Negative sentences in Abun are
formed by two negative particles rather than only one. The dual negative particles that are
21    I n § 1 2. 1 i t i s shown that Abun prepositions not only link phrases to clauses but also link embedded
      clauses.
1 76                                                                                 CHAPTER 10used in Abun must bracket or enclose the entire verb phrase (in transformational grammar
terms) or predicate (in traditional grammar terms, meaning all the constituents that follow the
subject). Because of this, any subordinate clause that is under the matrix clause is always
included within the grammatical scope of the negation. This means that although it is the verb
of the matrix clause that is being negated, the final negative particle will not occur until after
the subordinate clause. The following example illustrates this, where the subordinate clause is
of the relative type, with the negative particle nde actually occurring after the relative clause
without negating the relative clause itself.
   l O.48    A n yo    ki     su-gato ibit subot nan          ma      nde.
             3PL NEG say thing-REL bad about           2so    exist NEG
             They did not say anything that was bad about you at all.
   In order for negative raising to take place as has been attempted in example l O.47 , only
one negative particle, -yo-, will move in order to negate the matrix verb nut 'think' . Due to
the structure and word order of complex negative constructions in Abun it is not possible to
shift the second negative particle nde and retain a grammatical sentence. Abun rules of word
order do not allow this. Normally in languages that allow negative raising the means of
negation is syntactically removed from the subordinate clause and 'raised' into the main
clause. Because Abun negation involves the use of two particles, both of these cannot be
'raised' from the complement clause. This structural limitation shows that negative raising is
not possible in Abun.
lO.3 EMBEDDED COMPLEMENTS
   The second type of complement to be found in Abun does not make use of the
complementiser. For want of a better label we have called these complements 'embedded' .
There are mainly two types of predicate which do not need to have a complementiser: those
which involve desiderative or attitudinal predicates and those which involve some type of
force, that is a manipulative predicate. These semantic distinctions are illustrated by the type
of verb suffix used. Attitudinal predicates make use of the suffix -wa, while those indicating
some sort of force or pressure (manipulative) use -gat. Examples of these verb types which
do not use a complementiser are fwa 'want' , bariwa 'not.want/dislike', nyuwa 'fear' and
nokwa 'worry about' , all being attitudinal predicates, and wergat 'persuade/pressurise' and
krokgat 'annoy/stir up' being manipulative predicates. Other manipulative predicates will be
discussed later in the chapter.
   The following examples illustrate these complement types:
   10.49     A n i-wa       ji     jam     mo an          sor.
             3so happy-TRS I so listen to         3so     only
             She wanted me to listen only to her.
   lO.50     An    bari-wa         an jam mo            ji.
             3so not.want-TRS 3so listen to             3so
             She did not want to listen to me.
   lO.5 1    Ii nok-wa       an maskwa ji.
             I so worry-TRs 3so angry        I so
             I was worried she (would be) angry (with) me.
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                                      1 77     1 0.52      A n krokgat ye         mwa maskwa yu.
                 3sG stir.up    people many angry        REFL
                 He stirred up many people (making them) angry with each other.
     1 0.53      Men yo      wergat ye-wis         Yi      ben-bot suk             re     nde.
                 I pL NEG force      PERs-kind other do-about thing                this   NEG
                 We do not force other tribes to do these things.
   In other languages, besides Abun, a different predicate type can mean a different
complement type. For instance Givan ( 1 990:553) states that it is ""more common to find
subordinating morphemes in complements of cognition-utterance verbs, as compared with
manipulative or modality verbs"". Givan' s categories roughly compare to the Abun
categories described above. All Abun utterance predicates use the complementiser (his
'subordinating morpheme' ) when the complement is intended to refer to direct spe�ch.22
His 'modality' predicates include the verb 'want' , which is under discussion here, and also
other verbs which are not in the class of verbs for Abun . 2 3 In English, attitudinal and
manipulative predicates are distinguished by having a complement of an infinitival structure.
Utterance predicates have complements which use a subordinating conjunction 'that'. Givan
further distinguished predicates (such as English 'want' and the manipulative predicate
'order') in that the infinitival complements of these verbs could not tolerate further embedded
clauses such as relative clauses and clefts ( 1 993:68). In Abun, these predicates likewise take
complements that are structurally quite different from the 'utterance predicates' and others
described in § 1O.2 above. The manipulative predicate ben 'make' , discussed later, does not
take a complementiser. A predicate such as let does not have a distinct lexical form in Abun
and is always rendered as fwa 'happy to' . Likewise the predicate oswa 'help' , although not
a desiderative predicate, makes use of the suffix -wa to indicate an embedded complement
clause. For example:
     10.54       Sane Markus os-wa duno an.
                 so   Markus help teach 3sG
                 So Markus helped to teach her.
   Besides not taking the complementiser do these complement types are structurally
different in another important way. These complement types function as the object of the
main clause. On the other hand those which use a complementiser do not, as was shown in
§ 10.2 .4 earlier. The complement clauses of § 10.2 were described as fitting into Abun
sentence structure in the following way:
              SUBJECT + VERB + (OBJECT) + (INDIRECT OBJECT) + (do) + (COMPLEMENT CLAUSE)
  The complement clause types under discussion here are structurally quite different. These
complement clauses function as the object and so the sentence has the following structure:
                                         SUBJECf + VERB + OBJECT
22    One predicate kendo 'call' does not use the complementiser if the complement does not represent
      direct speech. This distinction will be looked at further in § 10.3.3
23    These include 'start' , 'finish' and 'try' which are all adverbs in Abun, namely sim 'just started' or
      'finished/completely' bergan 'almost ' .
178                                                                                 CHAPTER 10   Earlier, example 1 0.40 above was shown in such a way that its constituent structure was
fully described. If example 1 0.49 is repeated in the same way the structural difference
between the complement types is clearer:
     10.55       An               twa          ji          jam     mo     an      sor.
       3sG              want         1 sG         listen to      3sG    only
       Subject          Verb                 Object (Complement Clause)
      She wanted me to only listen to her.
  What evidence is there to support this analysis that, when no complementiser is used the
complement clause is actually the object of the main clause rather than an additional
constituent within it? There are actually two points at issue here. Firstly, clauses like ji jam
mo an sor from example 10.55 above are actually full clauses and as such they are
complement clauses embedded in a larger structure, rather than being separate assertions.
Secondly, these clauses represent the object of the main clause in which they are embedded.
Each of these points will be looked at in tum.","[187, 188, 189, 190]"
"
10.4 ADDITIONAL POSSmll...ITIES
   So far two types of complement have been described, those that use the complementiser
and those that do not. There are certain predicates which, when they take a complement, do
so only by using the complementiser. We would like to call this type of predicate Type l .
Then there are a small number of predicates where n o complementiser i s used and the
complement clause is an embedded object. We would like to call this type of predicate Type
2. Then there is another type of predicate (Type 3), which is able to take complement clauses
of both types that is with and without the complementiser. Table 10. 1 below lists these three
predicate types:
1 86                                                                                   CHAPTER 10                                    TABLE 10. 1 : PREDlCA1ETYPES                         TYPE   1                      TYPE   2                    TYPE 3                         with COM                    without COM            with and without COM

pretence                                                                   kidar     'lie/trick'
predicates   Sentences which take predicates termed Type 1 have been previously analysed to have the
following structure:
       SUBJECT + PREDICATE 1 + (OBJECT) + (INDIRECT OBJECT) + (do) + (COMPLEMENT CLAUSE)
  This type of predicate can have a maximum valency of three, if the complement clause is
considered in apposition to the direct object.
   Sentences which take predicates termed Type 2 have been analysed as fol lows:
                      SUBJECT + PREDICA1E 2 + COMPLEMENT CLAUSE AS OBJECT
   This type of predicate has a valency of only two.
   Sentences which take predicates termed Type 3 have two possible representations:
                 SUBJECT + PREDICA1E 3 + OBJECT + (do) + (COMPLEMENT CLAUSE)
                                                CR
                          SUBJECT + PREDICA1E 3 + COMPLEMENT CLAUSE AS OBJECT
   Again if the complement clause is considered to be in apposition to the direct object like
those of Type 2, these predicates have a valency of only two but the sentence contains an
additional constituent. In the alternative structure the sentence is identical to that for predicate
Type 2.
  Examples of predicates of this third type are given below showing both possibilities, with
and without the complementiser do.
COMPLEMENT ClAUSES                                                                                1 8710.4. 1 MANIPUlATIVE PREDICATES
   There are two manipulative predicates which when they take a complement clause may be
with or without the complementiser. These are syogat 'order' and syaugat 'command
strongly' .
   1 0.73     An        syogat j i  do j i so     nyom             wa an.
              3sG       order   ISG CX)M l SG buy machete          for 3sG
              He told me to buy a machete for him.
   10.74      An        syogat pa     jogru      san.
              3SG   order    chjld take.off clothes
              He ordered the girl to take off (her) clothes.
   Example 1 0.73 shows syogat 'order/tell' with the complement clause as an appositional
constituent within the sentence in addition to the direct object, the pronoun ji ' l sG ' . In 1 0.74,
however, the entire embedded complement clause is the object. In this case no
complementiser is used since a complementiser is used only when the complement clause is
in apposition to the direct object. The English translation of both 10.73 and 1 0.74 does not
show these structural differences, as both complement clauses have been translated using
infinitive verb forms. A more structurally correct translation of 1 0.73 would be something
like 'He ordered me to do this: 'Buy a machete for me' .
   Simi lar examples are given below for syaugat 'command' . Example 1 0.75 appeared
earlier as example 1 0.9.
   1 0.75    An syaugat  men-ka-we do men-ka-we ki suk-du
             3sG command I PL-cL-two COM I PL-cL-two say NOM-Speak
              re    0        nde.
              this again NEG
              He commanded the two of us not to tell this story again.
   1 0.76    Ji syaugat   yen    ma   but     nm.
             I SG command people come capture 2PL
             I commanded you to be captured.","[197, 198, 199]"
"27     An alternative analysis is that these are treated as serial verbs.
28     It could be stated that the fact that subjectless constituents do not exist elsewhere in the language
       does not in itself represent an argument that they do not exist in the constructions shown here. It
       needs to be pointed out that in Abun there is not sufficient syntactic evidence to posit that a
       subjectless subordinate clause exists as a real constituent in the language, either in these cases or
       anywhere else. The only reason for positing that such a constituent may exist here is not due to
       syntactic evidence but rather to accommodate a certain theoretical position. In order to master a
       second language properly the language learner must not only master vocabulary but also master the
       syntactic patterns that are found in the language. In order to speak Abun effectively it is not
       necessary to include in one's inventory of syntactic patterns a reduced clause of this kind. It seems
       strange to add to the list of Abun clause types a reduced clause which does not have any specific
       syntactic marking to indicate its separate existence. This raises the question of whether certain
       clause types should be added to the language' s inventory when the only basis for doing so is
       theoretical rather than observed syntactic evidence.
COMPLEMENf ClAUSES                                                                           185   There is one other means o f syntactic evidence to indicate that only one constituent, a
complement clause which functions as object, follows these predicate types. It is possible to
restructure some of these sentences so they can be stated as cleft sentences. For example
10.63 repeated here as 1 0.7 1 can be restructured to approximate a cleft sentence.
   1 0.7 1   An      i-wa           ji    si    an rnu rno nggwe.
             3sG be.happy-TRs l sG with 3sG go to             garden
             She wanted me to go with her to the garden.
   1 0.72    Su-ga          an    i-wa         anato j i s i    an       rnu rno nggwe.
             thing-sPEC 3sG       be.happY-TRS FOC    l SG with 3SG     go to     garden
             What she wanted was that I go with her to the garden.
   Later in § 1 2.6 these types of constructions will be discussed further. However it is clear
from example 10.72 that, while Abun does not have a passive construction through which
the object can be identified, the means of focus that is possible by the noun modifier anato
serves the same function. If the question 'What was it that she wanted?' was asked the
answer would be as in 1 0.72. The object of the predicate i-wa is clearly located after the
focus particle anato and it is obviously the entire clause. Therefore it is preferable to analyse
these complement clauses as the object of the main clause rather than positing the alternative
structure discussed here.
   Noonan ( 1 985: 1 33) makes the claim that ""All languages have an s-like indicative
complement type, and all languages have some sort of reduced complement type in
opposition to the indicative"". In comparing languages he posits a minimum of these two
complement types which constitute the smallest kind of complement system that is found in
the world's languages. According to his definition, Abun has only one complement type, not
two, since all Abun complement clauses are indicative clauses. However, we would like to
suggest that Abun does have two complement types-those with complementisers and those
without (in this work termed 'embedded' ). The basis for these distinctions is not found
within the complement clause itself. This has been the basis on which Noonan and others
have made their division of complement types. This basis has come from the alteration in
structure of the complex sentence of which the complement is a part. External rather than
internal considerations have been the basis for the division of Abun complement types. In
this way Abun is different in its complement structure to other languages that have been
described.","[196, 197]"
"
4.7.3 CLEFT-LIKE CONSTRUcnONS
  According to Huddleston ( 1 984:459) the general effect of a cleft construction is to give
added prominence to a particular constituent, which he calls the highlighted element.
  The Abun equivalent of what translates into English as a cleft is not syntactically a cleft
construction. In other words, there is no subordinate clause or division into two clauses that
causes prominence of a particular constituent. Instead, a particle anato serves to highlight the
constituent immediately preceding it and intensifies any focus or topics already structured.
For example, compare unmarked example 4.63a with the cleft-like construction in 4.63b:
  4.63 a.     Ron bi      wa     men.
              Ron pay for        1 PL
              Ron paid for us.
           b. Ron ana-to       bi    wa men.
              Ron FOC-NMP pay for 1 PL
              1 . It was Ron who paid for us.
              2. Ron is the one who paid for us.
   Anato i s a compound of ana 'FOCUS' and to 'NOUN MODIFYING PARTICLE' . To usually
indicates that embedding will follow. Such embedding refers to and modifies the noun
preceding. In other words, to introduces more information about the preceding noun. So we
64                                                                               CHAPTER 4know that any noun followed by to is going to have some modification. In this case the
additional information conveyed by adding to to the noun is that of prominence, highlighting
or additional focus.

                                   PHRASE STRUCTURE   The structure of phrases in Abun is consistent with what has already been stated about its
syntax; namely that fixed word order and particles, rather than affixation, are used to signify
meaning.
   This chapter consists of a survey of phrase types, namely verb phrases (§5 . 1 ), noun
phrases (§5.2), possessive phrases (§5.3), prepositional phrases (§5.4), adverbial and
adjectival phrases (§5.5), quantifier phrases (§5 .6) and complex phrases (§5.7). The head of
each phrase type is indicated by word order, and word order alone. Table 5 . 1 below
summarises the structure of each of these phrase types.","[75, 76, 77]"

10.2.4.3 THE dO-ClAUSE MAY rou.ow AN INDIRECT OBJECT OR A PRFPOSmONAL PHRASE
    Abun word order is such that if there is a prepositional phrase then this follows the
indirect object and is the final constituent of the clause. If the clause contains no prepositional
phrase then the indirect object is the final constituent. In example 10.44 below the do-clause
occurs after an indirect object. Since in Abun a direct object never follows an indirect object,
it is not possible that the do-clause of this example could be considered to function as the
object of the main clause.
   10.44 Yerom         ki         nai    yewon        do           Nan   hi     nyanggon     ne     i.

                                                                        relative

                                Object
 Yerom (a spirit) said to the shaman that, ""Your female relative is sick"".
   Likewise in example 10.45 below, given earlier as example 10.5, the do-clause follows a
prepositional phrase.
   10.45     An      tom         su   men do nzn            mukom mo-tu
             3sG     prior.agree with l pL COM 2PL          reach there-distant

             then.lRR 2PL wait.for l SG there
             He arranged with us that ""When you get there, you wait for me there"".
   It is not possible to have the direct object following a prepositional phrase. Therefore the
do-clause in examples like 1 0.45 cannot be considered to function as a direct object. The
complement clause is an additional constituent within the clause linked to the main clause by
COMPLEMENT CLA USES                                                                                       1 75means of the complementiser do. It will be seen later that, in Abun , prepositions may also
link embedded clauses to the main clause. 2 1
10.2.5 NEOATNE RAISINO
   When a complement clause contains a negative, it is possible in the great majority of the
world' s languages for the negative marker to be removed from the complement and 'raised'
into the matrix clause (Noonan 1985:90). This has been termed 'negative raising' and is
generally possible with a limited set of predicates such as 'think' , 'believe' and 'want' .
Negative raising does not occur in Abun. There are a number of reasons for this.","[186, 187]"
"   The embedded clause of example 10.40 is in apposition to the object suk 'thjng' . It is an
expansion of the object or gives clear content to it. It is certrunly not common to have a
structure as ful l as this, but 1 0.40 shows that if there is a do-clause it occurs after the object
and indirect object, if these constituents are present. In 1 0.40 the object, here suk 'thjng', is a
generic non-specific noun without any known or specific content until the do-clause is given.
Because the do-clause is a more internally complex constituent than a single noun such as
suk, the placing of the do-clause in sentence-final position, rather than immediately following
the object, is an example of the heavy-to-the-right movement principle. This principle of
word order, evident in many languages, shifts larger complex units to the right, that is
towards the end of the sentence, to reduce burden on the short-term memory (Mallinson &
Blake 1 98 1 : 1 5 1 , 1 56ff).
  Examples 1 0.4 1 , 1 0.42 and 1 0.43 below are also typical of the types of sentence which
contain do-clauses in addition to direct objects.
     10.41
                                                      (]

       Isak              say          thing                              2so       thjnk      short     AQvf.

      Isak said something bke ""Are you stupid?"" or what Isak srud was ""Are you stupid?""",[185]

9.5.2 ABUN RELATIVEClAUSES ANDTHE ACCESSIBILITY H1ERARCHY
   Keenan and Comrie ( 1 977) in their work on relative clauses devised a hierarchy they
called the Accessibility Hierarchy which summarised their findings across a wide sample of
languages. They had investigated the types of constraints across languages on which
grammatical relations could be relativised. Comrie ( 1 989: 1 56) later refined this hierarchy so
that ""The hierarchy subject > direct object > non-direct object > possessor defines ease of
accessibility to relative clause formation"". He stated that ( 1 989: 1 56): ""if a language can form
relative clauses on a given position on the hierarchy, it can also form relative clauses on all
positions higher (to the left) on the hierarchy"".
   How do Abun relative clauses compare to this hierarchy? Does this hierarchy hold true
for Abun? In §9.5 . 1 above, several examples were given which showed that various
positions along the hierarchy could be relativised. In fact in Abun all positions on Comrie's
Accessibility Hierarchy can be relativised.
   Keenan ( 1 985 : 1 56), when referring to the different strategies that a language may use to
form relative clauses, noted that ""pronoun retaining strategies are (a) more effective means of
forming RCS (restrictive relative clauses) than RPRO (relative pronoun) or gapping strategies"",14   Probably the formula should contain ± OBJECT, but n o examples with a n object occur i n the corpus
     of data.
15   It i s our experience i n living among Abun speakers that such errors that Giv6n imagines rarely arise.
     Because word order is the main means of encoding grammatical relations, there are very strong
     internal expectations in the mind of the hearer. These expectations are not necessary for languages
     which use case marking or affixation for deriving meaning. The device of the boundary marker is
     strongly used throughout Abun grammar to assist hearers in encoding meaning. It is used in
     negative constructions and in interrogatives. Here, also, the dual particles involved could be
     considered as 'bracketing' devices. These are discussed more fully Chapters 6 and 8.
156                                                                                                 CHAPTER 9since he considered that more positions along the hierarchy could be relativised when the
pronoun was retained. Although Abun does not use a pronoun-retaining strategy, but a gap
strategy, this does not prevent a wide range of positions being relativised. There do not
appear to be restrictions on relative clause formation in Abun. However the last level of the
hierarchy, that of 'possessor', has limited formation possibilities in Abun . Examples 9.30 to
9.37 below illustrate the formation of relative clauses at different levels along the
Accessibility Hierarchy.","[167, 168]"

3 .2 EsTABLISHING WORD CLASSES
   In this section the parts of speech appropriate for the Abun language will be defined after a
discussion of the basis upon which the distinctions are made.
    In establishing the parts-of-speech classification for the Abun language, grammatical
criteria have been employed, namely the word ' s distribution, its range of syntactic functions
and the morphological or syntactical categories for which it is specifiable. These criteria are
listed by Schachter ( 1 985 :3), who states they are not open to the objections of unclear
application that traditional definitions are.
   Once the types of word classes are established on the basis of grammatical criteria, they
are given a label that reflects their characteristics. For example, words that express actions,
processes and the like are called verbs. A label for a word class is decided upon after the
word class has been established.
MORPHOWGYAND WORD ClASSES                                                                  25   Honey ( 1 972: 277) makes the point that ""the object of the grammarian i s to establish
categories of words which are most efficient for enabling him to make the most
comprehensive and, at the same time, the simplest grammatical statements . . . "". Honey
developed systematic syntactic statements whereby he established his system of word classes
for Vietnamese (which is also an analytical language like Abun) on the basis of positional
relationships of certain selected words and/or classes of words. Some of his methods have
been applied in order to establish a set of word classes for Abun.
   The word classes in Abun have been divided into open and closed classes. Open classes
of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs have a membership that is in principle unlimi ted.
Closed classes, which in Abun are noun adjuncts, verb adjuncts, conj unctions, proforms,
particles and interjections, have a fixed and generally small number of words.","[36, 37]"

1 .6 ABUN AND OTHER WEST PAPUAN PHYLUM LANGUAGES
   The closest language lexically to the Abun language is Mai Brat (and in particular, the
Karon Dori dialect), which is also part of the Central B ird' s Head Stock, but is in a different
family, the Central B ird' s Head Family. Even then the lexical relationship is rather low:
somewhere in the order of 1 0-15% are cognate depending upon the dialects compared. Berry
and Berry ( 1 987:30) show figures of 6-8% cognate for a dialect of Mai Brat and each of the
three main Abun dialects. This is based on a word list of 200 words. However, when the
Swadesh 1 00 list is used the percentages tend to be about 5% higher as illustrated in Berry
and Berry ( 1 987:56).
   The other West Papuan Phylum languages show a lexical similarity of 3-6% (Berry &
Berry 1987: 30), or about 8- 1 1 % based on the 1 00-word Swadesh list. According to the
critical percentages used for classification of languages based on lexicostatistical comparison
in Voorhoeve ( 1 975a: 1 6), these other languages would be considered as part of a different
stock to Abun. A figure of 1 2-27% of shared cognates would result in the classification of
the languages as belonging to the same stock, but different families. So Abun and Mai Brat
belong to one stock, but they are in different families, on the basis of lexical similarity. The
other languages in the West Papuan Phylum in the Bird's Head belong to other stocks.
8                                                                                       CHAPTER 1    Phonologically, Abun and other WPP languages are very similar in terms of the number
and types of phonemes and syllable structure. However, there are several differences
between Abun and the closest related language, Mai Brat. Specifically, there is one additional
consonant phoneme in Mai Brat Ih/, and a much wider variety of consonant clusters,
including Isr/, Ihr/, Irkn/, Imki, Imsy/, Imf/, which do not occur in Abun . Also in Abun, tone
is significant, but not in Mai Brat. To the east, Mpur also has several contrastive tones.
   Syntactically all WPP languages are simi lar. All have svo sentence structure. Even so,
there are differences between Abun and Mai Brat as revealed in Brown ( 1 990:43-6 1).
Brown's paper on nominal phrases alone reveals that Mai Brat has an obligatory subject
person agreement prefix on verbs. According to Wurm ( 1982:208), ""An important structural
and typological feature of the West Papuan Phylum languages is the indication of both
subject and object of the verbs by prefixes, with a masculine-feminine gender distinction in
the 3sg"". This may be true of most other members of WPP, but for Abun there are no such
prefixes on verbs nor is there a masculine-feminine distinction. Abun stands in stark contrast
to other WPP languages at this point.
   An examination of Brown ' s examples also reveals that in Mai Brat possessive phrases,
where kinship relationships are involved, the possessor and the possessum are j uxtaposed.
However in Abun, a linker, hi is used. Thus there are some significant differences between
Abun and the closest related WPP language, Mai Brat, but most of the basic syntax is
similar. For a more detailed comparison of Abun with other WPP languages in terms of
phonology and syntax see Berry and Berry ( 1 987 :30-35).","[19, 20]"

3.4.5 PARTICLES
  There are several subclasses of particles including a topicaliser particle, a particle used for
negation, three aspect, three modal and eight mood particles. The term particle is used to
mean a free form word that does not take any type of inflection. It is an invariant form that
never occurs in an environment where i t could be described as 'bound' .
   The topicaliser or focus particle is ana(to), which always occurs after the subject and
before the verb. See §4.7.2 for more details about the use of this particle.
   There is one negative particle, nde, which occurs after the predicate and before aspect
mood or modal particles. Used on its own it may answer a question in the negative. To form
the indicative negative this particle along with the predicate marker yo form a linked pair of
particles. These particles jointly bracket the constituent 'predicate' . Used in a sentence without
yo, nde makes the mood of the sentence prohibitive. For further details see §8.
   If a clause includes aspect, modal or mood particles, those particles will always be in
clause-final position in that order. The particles may occur after either the verb, the object, the
indirect object or an adjunct, depending on the constituents of the particular clause concerned.
Also, these particles are not clitics in that the particle takes equivalent phonological stress
along with every other word in the clause.
46                                                                                            CHAPTER 3     The three aspect particles are listed in Table 3 . 1 5 below. For more detail s see §7. 1 .

                            t6               incompletive        yet, stil l
   There i s a limited number of particles which some writers refer to as 'modality ' rather
than as aspect (Foley 1 986: 1 5 2ff.). In Abun, three modal particles are used. These are listed
in Table 3 . 1 6 below and are discussed in more detail in §7.2.","[57, 58]"
"   9.27      Yen       kenda da     nu-fa             ne     nu        gato
             people call       COM house-taboo        DEr    house RH..             ye        me ka      ma    nde.
             people see form exist NEG
             1 . People call it the sacred house, the house that must not be seen.
             2. People call it the sacred house, that people must not see the form of it.
   In all these examples, although they represent relativisations of a direct object, the
determiner has not been used. The word order is sufficient to locate the gap, created by the
omission of the head, since prepositional phrases must always follow a direct object. In these
cases the gap is not clause-final and there is no need to indicate the boundary of the restricting
clause. Therefore, whenever there is an adjunct or complement of some kind within the
structure of the restricting clause, the determiner does not need to be used. So a relativisation
of the direct object may have the following composition:                             HEAD+ gata +SUBJ+ VERB+GAP+DET
                                            OR
                               +    +
                     HEAD+ gata SUBJ VERB  +GAP+ADJUNCT/COMPLEMENT
   The same situation is evident when a non-direct object is being relativised. In example
9.28 below, the preposition su 'with' indicates a prepositional phrase. The gap is indicated by
the presence of the preposition without the noun which normally accompanies it. Although
the gap here is clause-final it is part of the prepositional phrase. Part of the phrase is present,
so it is not necessary to use ne since there is another means through which the location of the
gap may be encoded.
   9.28      Suk-i       gato an       kamba     su     an        ye          teker   ware.
             NOM-sick RH.. 3SG wear.out with 3SG difficult too.much FRUS
             The sickness that she was worn out with, she suffered terribly (with it) (so that
             she could not do anything).
   Example 9.29 is similar to example 9.28 .
   9.29      Yen      fro       nggumwak ga men sem mo.
             people prepare room          RH.. 1 PL sleep LOC
             The people prepared a room that we would sleep in.
   The way that the determiner is used is shown in the following summary of restricting
clause types:
RELATfVE CLAUSES                                                                                       1 55      HEAD = SUBJ                GAP + VERB ± OBJECr ± ADJUNcr/COMPLEMENT
      HEAD = OBJ                 SUBJ + VERB + GAP + DET
      HEAD = OBJ                 SUBJ + VERB + GAP + ADJUNcr/COMPLEMFNr
      HEAD= OIHER                SUBJ + VERB + PREP + GAP 1 4
   Therefore, i t appears that the main function of the determiner is t o locate the position o f the
gap within the relative clause when the gap occurs in a clause-final position. Usually it is by
word order that the gap is located within the restricting clause. Since the determiner acts to
close the clause like some kind of boundary marker then it is still possible to locate the gap in
these situations. Giv6n ( 1990:659-660) stated that the gap strategy is most commonly found
in languages with rigid word order, as is the case with Abun. However, he felt that
""processing rate"" would be longer in such languages as well as ""increased error rate, and
increased dependence on context"" (Giv6n 1 990:660ff). If there were no boundary marker, it
would not be fully clear where the gap was and such 'increased errors' as Giv6n describes
could arise. B ut the device of a boundary marker behaves as another means for hearers to
correctly encode what they hear. Together with the relative conjunction gato, the determiner
'brackets' the relative clause. l s There are some instances where some speakers will use ne to
close the relative clause even though the gap is not clause-final. It may be that they want to
add extra certainty that the relative clause is in fact closed and this is made more evident by
the 'bracketing' nature of the determiner.","[166, 167]"
"   There are two patterns o f negation found in Abun a s follows:                                          S PRED nde
                                         syo PRED nde
   They are unusual and have been documented in only a few languages. In SVo languages
the negative particle normal ly precedes the verb (Payne 1985b:224). One would expect the
particle nde to be preverbal, but instead, in Abun, it is not only postverbal but also postobject
and adjunct. This pattern type, though uncommon, is also found in a few documented
languages such as Bolewa, Ngizim, Angas, Ron, Gisiga, Higi and Tera (Payne 1 985b:226).
   Furthermore the second pattern type, where a pair of linked negative particles occur, is
also uncommon. In French a linked pair of particles is used in negation, but this pair brackets
only the verb and its associated clitics, whereas in Abun the linked pair brackets the whole
predicate including object and adjuncts. However, this pattern type is an attested one in some
Chadic languages such as Hausa, Jegu and Sura (Payne 1 985b: 225-226). The difference
with these languages is that their word order is not rigid as in Abun. In Hausa both particles
can move to bracket the constituent that is to be negated, and thereby very neatly indicate the
scope and focus of negation (Schachter 1985:60).",[144]
"   What factors govern the use of the determiner in the relative clause? It is not found in
every instance of a restrictive relative clause. Example 9.22 above has no determiner, in
contrast to example 9.23, in which the restrictive relative clause is closed by the determiner
ne. These two examples differ in two ways. Firstly, in example 9.22 the relativised argument
of the clause has the grammatical relation of subject. In 9.23 the relativised argument has the
grammatical relation of object. Secondly, due to Abun word order the location of the gap in
each restricting clause is different. In example 9.22 the gap is clause-initial since the subject in
Abun is clause-initial. In 9.23 the gap would have been clause-final if the determiner had not
closed the restricting clause. The determiner, by closing the clause, actually assists in locating
the gap, and thereby assists in encoding the grammatical relation of the head.
   The determiner's role in locating the gap is most clearly seen when a direct object is to be
relativised. The determiner ne is used frequently when a direct object is to be relativised, but
not in all instances. To understand how the determiner is used in locating the gap in the
restricting clause, several examples are set out below. In example 9.24 to 9.27 both the head
and the relative conjunction have been highlighted. Further elements within the restricting
clause are underlined to show where the determiner has been omitted. Example 9.24 shows
the determiner as it normally appears, at the end of the relative clause.
   9.24      Men ki nai yu do suk        gato men y e      mo
             I pL say 10 REFL COM things REL IPL difficult exist
             re     ne, men ku reo
             PERF   DEf 1 PL get PERF
             We said to each other that we have the things that we needed.
   In the following examples, 9.25 to 9.27, the omitted direct object is not the final element
of the relative clause, as is the case in 9.24 above, where the determiner ne closes the relative
clause. In examples 9.25 and 9.26 there is a phrase which fol lows the gap, an adjunct phrase
in 9.25 and an indirect object phrase in 9.26.
   9.25      An ndo mo ji bi      nggon subot ji   bi   bllkll
             3sG ask to l SG POSS woman about I SG POSS book

             He asked my wife about my book that she bumed in the fire.

             The child thought that he (would) do the many things that his mother (had)
             taught to him.
1 54                                                                                   CHAPTER 9   In example 9.27 below, the word ka 'formlbody' actually is a reference to the head of the
relative clause within the restricting clause. In English this needs to be translated as 'its
body ' , so that a pronoun replacing the head is now within the restricting clause. In these
instances there is now actually no gap (created by the omission of the head) within the
restricting clause because a word such as ka refers to the head, which in this example has the
grammatical relation of direct object. This creates no need for the use of the determiner ne.","[165, 166]"
"   Therefore, Abun is an isolating language, mostly monosyllabic. In the few cases of
affixation and word compounding that do occur, the morphemes are easily segmentable.
   The implications of very little affixation in Abun are that other strategies are required to
effect what is normally achieved through affixation. For example, in many languages
affixation on the head of a noun phrase defines grammatical relations. However, in Abun,
word order alone defines core grammatical relations, while prepositions are used with
obliques. Number is expressed with a classifier and a number word, rather than an affix.
Possession is not marked with an affix, but instead a linker is used between the possessor
and the possessum.
   Very little affixation occurs on Abun verbs. Instead of person/number agreement affixes
on verbs, only free form pronouns are used. While other languages in the West Papuan
Phylum have both free pronorrunal forms and person/number prefixes on verbs, including
the most closely related language, Maibrat, Abun does not. Time adverbs, temporal
prepositional phrases and some conjunctions indicate notions of time normally carried by
tense affixes. Polarity, aspect, mood and modality are conveyed by the use of particles, not
by affixation on verbs as is common in Papuan languages (Foley 1 986).
  The processes of word-building in Abun are therefore rather lirruted. The following
processes are evident: lirruted suffixation on verbs (§3 . 3 . 1 ) ; three prefixes for nouns (§3.3.2);
word compounding, principally in nouns (§3.3 .2); and some adjectives are used as manner
adverbs (§3.3.3 and §3.3 .4).",[36]
"
1.5 THE GENERAL LINGUISTIC SITUATION
1.5.1 CLASSlFICATION OF THE AEUN LANGUAGE
   The Abun language is classified as a Papuan language by Wurm (1982:206). It belongs to
the small West Papuan Phylum. It is part of the Bird' s Head Superstock, the Central Bird's
Head Stock, and more specifically the North Bird' s Head Family, of which Abun and Madik
are listed as members. While Wurm listed Abun and Madik as separate languages, Berry and
Berry (1987) have presented further information regarding lexical similarities and structural
similarities which indicate that Abun and Madik are dialects of the same language. Therefore,
Abun is a farillly-Ievel isolate in the Central Bird's Head Stock.
4                                                                                    CHAPTER 11.5.2 PAPUAN VERSUS AUS1RONESIAN FFATURfS OFTIIE AEUN LANGUAGE
   Wurm's classification of Abun as a Papuan language seems to be based mainly on its
lexical inventory, with special reference to its set of personal pronouns. There are a
considerable number of Austronesian loan words in the West Papuan (WP) Phylum
languages, and when only non-Austronesian lexical items are compared, the lexical
interrelationship between the WPP languages is much closer. WPP languages in the Bird's
Head contain a small Trans New Guinea (TNG) Phylum lexical element, some of which
may be due to borrowing from the South Bird's Head Stock (which is part of the TNG
Phylum), or may be traces of an old TNG Phylum substratum (Wurm 1 982:204). The
personal pronouns are clearly Papuan, belonging to Wurm's set III (Wurm 1 982:40). Abun
personal pronouns do not distinguish between first person plural inclusive and exclusive,
whereas this is universal for Austronesian languages. Neither are there bound subject
markers on the verb, which is a feature of Austronesian languages. Thus Abun' s pronouns
are more akin to Papuan languages than to Austronesian languages.
   Other Papuan (or perhaps non-Austronesian) features include: no bound subject markers
on the verb, phonologically relevant tone and an irrealis-realis (or non-pasUpast) distinction
which is marked only on complex sentences. Perhaps the most striking Papuan features of
Abun syntax are found at the level of the complex sentence. In some Abun complex
sentences there is no clear syntactic marking to distinguish those clauses which could be
considered subordinate from those which might be termed coordinate. This lack of
subordinate/coordinate distinction is found in Papuan clause-chaining languages. Likewise, in
Papuan clause-chaining languages the semantic notions of temporal sequence and
simultaneity are strongly marked (Longacre 1985:264). These notions also feature strongly in
Abun complex sentences.
   However, Abun has a number of Austronesian features. Most notable is the rigid word
order of svo as distinct from the Papuan SOY word order (Wurm 1 982:64). Other significant
Austronesian features include: a very simple derivational morphology; uncomplicated and
very little inflectional affixation; the common use of particles where verb affixation would be
used in Papuan languages; the use of prepositions instead of postpositions or case marking;
no special sentence-medial verbs; a decimal numbering system unlike the normal Papuan
binary, trinary or quinary systems (Wurm 1 982:64); the existence of reduplicated adverbs;
simple morphophonemic changes and the common use of labialised consonants.
    Despite these features which could make it appear that grammatically Abun has more in
common with Austronesian languages, Abun has some unique features which distinguish it
from both Papuan and Austronesian languages. The use of particles in Abun is so extensive
that it is far greater than in Austronesian languages such as Indonesian. Particles are the main
means of grammatical communication, with affixation playing an extremely minor role. Due
to the lack of affixation in Abun syntax, other grammatical strategies have been developed. In
particular, the use of bracketing (whereby two particles act as boundary markers for a
particular grammatical constituent) serves to identify some important grammatical features,
namely negation, interrogatives and relative clauses. Therefore, Abun does not neatly fit into
either of the neighbouring language classifications, that is Austronesian or Papuan, but shares
features of both.
INTRODUcnON                                                                                51.5.3 THE INFLUENCE OF SURROUNDING lANGUAGES ON ABUN
   The influence of surrounding languages on Abun has been significant. It is particularly
easy to see the influence of Biak and Indonesian, as will be demonstrated below, but less so
the influence of the three neighbouring languages of Moi, Mpur and Mai Brat (Mare). This is
no doubt because the contact with Biak and Indonesian has been closer and more continuous.
   There are two tribal groups which have migrated to the region where Abun is spoken, the
As and the Biak people. The As language group, who migrated from Gag island before the
turn of the century, came to live in the subdistrict of Mega where the Abun Ji dialect is
spoken. The Biak people, who fled from the island of Biak, came into the Sausapor area in
the early 1 900s and have had a significant influence on the language of the Abun people. The
Biak people brought the Christian message to the Abun people and in doing so used many of
their own words and phrases. Words such as rur 'spirit', nadi 'pray' , sam 'worship' were
introduced from the Biak language. The word for 'God' , Yefun, has come from the Biakfun
'respected person' combined with the Abun personaliser prefix ye- 'person'. Also many
words for fish and terms related to the sea and seaside have been assimilated from the Biak
language.
   The Abun-speaking people have had contact not only with the Biak people. Trade in kain
timur '(antique) eastern cloth' with neighbouring language groups has had an influence on
Abun. Kain timur is one of the Abun-speaking people's main tokens of wealth and is used
for paying bride price as well as fines. It originates from East Timor.
   Most villagers stay close to their own village and do not travel far. Even so, the
Indonesian language has found its way to some extent even to the remotest Abun village.
Many Indonesian words also accompanied the introduction of Christianity and government
systems, and have become part of Abun vocabulary. Indonesian words such as selamat
'save' , ampuni 'forgive', perintah 'command, rule', desa 'village' and berkat 'bless' have
been introduced, although Abun speakers seldom understand the meaning of some of these
Indonesian terms.
   Several Indonesian and Biak verbs have been included in common use in Abun even
though in many cases there is an Abun lexical item for the same idea. A bi- prefix, probably
borrowed from the Biak language, is attached to verbs that are introduced from other
languages. All borrowed verbs are verbalised with what could be named, the foreign verb
verbaliser (FVV) prefix. Example 1 . 1 shows the borrowing of the Indonesian word mengerti
'understand'; example 1 .2 uses the Biak word win 'sail' .
   1. 1      I sak   bi-mengerti        suk        gata   nan   ki    ne.
             Isak FYV-understand thing which              2sG   say   DEf
             Isak understands what you are saying.
   1.2       Men bi-win         mu     ma     ef
             1 PL FYV-sail        go    LOC   island
             Let' s sail to the island.
   Abun-speaking people have borrowed words to handle new concepts such as sailing. In
example 1.2 the word is borrowed from Biak. The Abun people traditionally lived on and
around the Tambrau ranges and so did not have cause to sail anywhere. Other verbs that have
been introduced from Indonesian are tutup 'close', buka 'open' for closing and opening
6                                                                                    CHAPTER 1doors. Doors are also a new thing for the Abun. In the past they just had a nu-syo 'house
opening; doorway' (lit. house-mouth) with no door as such.
   Often the words borrowed by the Abun speaker do not retain the original pronunciation.
Abun does not have a separate velar nasal phoneme. The velar nasal occurs only medially
preceding a voiced velar plosive. So when words are borrowed such as bunga 'flower', the
ng (which represents a velar nasal) is pronounced as a prenasalised plosive by Abun
speakers. When a velar nasal is word-final in borrowed words such as kosong 'nil, empty,
zero', it is pronounced as an alveolar nasal, (koson).
   Words borrowed from other languages are also changed in pronunciation, not just
according to Abun phonology, but also because the first ones who heard the words that were
borrowed did not recall and repeat the words accurately. For example, the Biak word Jarkor
'study' was somehow changed to Jaskor by the speakers of Abun Ji dialect whereas Abun
Ye dialect speakers do not make any change.
   Indonesian conjunctions have also found their way into the Abun language. The main
conjunctions adopted from Indonesian are kalau 'if, when' , sebelum 'before', baru 'then (in
colloquial use)',jadi 'so, therefore' . Indonesian conjunctions are frequently used in addition
to Abun conjunctions because the placement of Abun conjunctions in the sentence often
differs from the Indonesian placement. In Indonesian the word sebelum 'before' is sentence­
initial, whereas in Abun the expression nde t6 'before' occurs at the end of the first clause as
in example 1 .3 below.
    1 .3        Men yo       mu    nde to,         men git su-git.
                1 PL NEG   go      NEG      INCAM 1 PL   eat NOM-eat
                Before we go let's eat.
   The Abun speaker who borrows the Indonesian sebelum 'before' , also keeps his own
language' s expression for the same idea. So the use of the more redundant form as in
example 1.4 is common.
    1.4         Sebelum men        yo       mu    nde    to,   men git su-git.

    This is not just limited to conjunctions but also to other items such as the Indonesian
 prohibitionjangan 'do not' . In Abun, negation requires that yo and nde bracket the predicate
as in example 1 .3. In the prohibitive form the yo is omitted. Example 1.5a is the traditional
 way of saying 'Don't cry!' , but Abun speakers who have been influenced by Indonesian add
jangan, as in 1 .5b. However, example 1.5c is unacceptable.
    1 .5 a.     Nan w o nde.

The Abun word jam has the meaning of both 'to know' and 'to understand' , as in examples
1 .6 and 1 .7. They have equated jam with the Indonesian word tahu 'to know', but have
borrowed the Indonesian mengerti 'to understand' in many cases to differentiate the two
concepts, as in example 1 .7b.
   l .6        Ii jam      an gum.
               ISG know 3sG name
               I know his name.

               ISG FVV-understand 2sG         POSS    NOM-speak
               I understand what you are saying.
   Some borrowed words undergo a shift in meaning from the original meaning in the
source language. For example, even though the Abun have a way to express intensification,
they have borrowed an Indonesian word, jadi 'to happen, become' and mixed this with nde
'not' to make jadi nde ' INTENSIFIER' . They actually have many ways of expressing
intensification (see §5 .5), but they have borrowed this, even though the actual use of the
Indonesian is not standard. The meaning of jadi nde according to its components is 'did not
happen' . B ut the meaning given to it is 'happened very much ' , as in example l . 8.
   1.8         A n w o jadi          nde.
               3sG cry happen        NEG

6.1 .4.4 TOPICAUSATION OF INFORMATION-SEEKlNG QUESTIONS
   Information-seeking questions, like indicative sentences, can be topicalised (see §4.7.2). In
these forms the question word is followed by the demonstrative-focus word (or topicaliser),
anato, as in example 6.54. The use of this form brings sukjan 'plants' into greater focus or
emphasis than the non-topicalised forms, as in 6.55 and 6.56.
   6.54      Te suk-jan        u         anato nan jan               ne ?
             lQM NOM-plant     which FOC          2SG plant          �
             Which plants are the ones that you planted?
   6.55      Te nan jan        suk-jan        u        ne ?
             IQM 2sG plant      oM-plant      which    �M
             Which plants did you plant?
   6.56      Nan jan      surna ne ?
             2sG plant what �M
             What did you plant?
   In a sample of 1 27 information-seeking questions, 25% were topicalised.
   In Abun the constituents of a sentence that may be topicalised in questions are the subject.
Even though the subject is the topic, it may receive extra focus by the use of anato, as in
example 6.57 and object, as in 6. 54.
   6.57      Te je        u        anato      ndar    ne      jau     ne?
             IQM person which FOC             dog     DEf     bite    �M
             Who was it that the dog bit?
   Other constituents such as location in example 6.58 cannot be topicalised.
   6.58      *Mo u           anato    nan ontu                   ne ?
             LOC which       FOC      2SG umbilical.cord         �M

   Abun has no special form for rhetorical questions. Instead interrogative sentences can be
used in a rhetorical sense; that is, the speaker not only is sure of the answer, but also requires
no answer. So on some occasions, although the structure is interrogative, the illocutionary
force i s not. This is plain in narrative texts where the speaker continues after asking a
'question' because the answer is obvious. Examples taken from text are:(i) a negative statement
   6.59      Ii da              sok ari              sarewo Yefun ne      sa u   ne ?
             ISG even. though enter church.service but        God OEM like which �
             1 . Even though I went to church, what was God like?
             2. Even though I went to church, I couldn't understand who God was.
   6.60      Ii     yo     bi     os  wa      ji      kern rno Dorn  nde
             I SG   NEG    POSS   way for     I SG    live in Sorong NEG
             be      je         u        anato rnewa       ji    ne ?
             later person which FOC              care.for ISG �
             1 . I had no way I could live in Sorong, who could take care of me?
             2. I couldn ' t live in Sorong because there was no one there who would have
                 taken care of me.(ii) an exclamation expressing surprise or even disgust
   6.6 1     An     jirnnot ware an          ki      do     ""Surna ben j i     anato
             3sG    think   FRUS 3sG         say     that   what   do   ISG    FOC
             ji      sern   rno      nat   re    e     ji   i     sare      ne ? ""
             ISG sleep we            place this and ISG sick like. this �
             1 . He thought about it with no success, ""What ever made me sleep in this place
                and get sick like this?""
             2. He couldn't work out what made him sleep in a place like that that made him
                so sick.
   Example 6.6 1 comes from a narrative, and at this point there was no interaction with
anyone. The speaker was really disgusted with himself for doing such a stupid thing. In
English we often ask ourselves, ""Why did I do such a stupid thing?"", in the sense, ""What a
stupid thing for me to have done !"" So the semantic force of this interrogative structure is not
to ask a question but to make a statement expressing disgust.(iii ) a statement expressing uncertainty
   This example comes from a narrative where the speaker was not interacting with anyone.
  6.62       An      ki    do     "" Ye      ne    Yesugote y e      Waropen bado ? ""
             3sG say that person that Irianese               person Waropen A(J.1
             1 . He said, ""Was that Irianese person a Waropen person?""
             2. I think he said that the Irianese person was a Waropen person.
1 16                                                                                 CHAPTER 6
(iv) a rebuke or negative command
   6.63     Nan nok         wa suma ne ?
            2sG afraid for what FQM
            1 . Why are you afraid?
            2. Don ' t be afraid!
    The above type of interrogative structure is a rhetorical question found in cases where the
speaker continues, not waiting for an answer. In the context of example 6.63, people said
(literally), ""Why are you afraid? Go on inside !"" In saying this they effectively rebuked the
one who was being slow about doing what he should have done.(v) a condition
   6.64      Yonatan    bi     ai     ndo   do    U Te more nu    sugit yo
             Yonatan    poss   father asked that IQM   here house food a
            yen bra jamsem yo              bado ? Ge         ber men git sore "".
            3PL boil cassava some AQv1               then    later I PL eat just
            Yonatan' s father said, ""If there is a restaurant here that boils cassava then let's
            just go and eat there"".
6.2 lMPERATlVES
   Imperative sentences convey a request, command, order, suggestion, instruction or an
entreaty. Sadock and Zwicky ( 1985: 1 7 1 ) note that since human social life so frequently
consists of activities of requesting, commanding and the like, no language (it seems) lacks a
form dedicated to imperative sentences. This is indeed true for Abun.
   First we will make some general typological comments about Abun imperative sentences
in relation to universal observations (§6.2. 1 ). This will be followed by a discussion of the
types of imperative sentences found in Abun consisting of the basic imperati ve type (§6.2.2),
a group of two types that may be called hortative (§6.2.3), and another type labelled
prohibitive (§6.2.4).
6.2. 1 lMPERATIVETYPOLOGY ANO ABUN
   Because the imperative mood is basically connected with the second person and relates to
an action to be performed in the immediate future, the second person pronoun, tense and
aspect distinctions are usually absent because they are implied. For this reason, verbs in the
imperative mood in many languages are in their most basic form. Indeed, Lyons ( 1 977: 746)
points out that in many languages imperative sentences are characterised by a change in the
form of the main verb of the sentence to its most simple form. However, in Abun, the form
of the verb is exactly the same as for declarative and interrogative moods. On the other hand,
consistent with most languages, tense and aspect distinctions, which are normally expressed
by adverbs and particles in Abun, are not found in imperative sentences. Instead Abun uses
optional particles to show strength of imperatives. These occur clause-finally.
   According to Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985: 1 73), the removal of the subject pronoun and/or
verbal concord affix i s amazingly common. Abun, however, does not allow the removal of
MARKED MOODS                                                                                   1 17the subject in imperative sentences. On the contrary, subject is obligatory in all types of Abun
speech acts.","[126, 127, 128, 129]"
"20    For the purposes of identification, the clause which the complementiser precedes has been termed
      the do-clause. It needs to be noted however that the subordinating conjunction do, although
      identifying the fol lowing subordinating clause, is actually phonologically part of the preceding
      clause. These diagrams show the main clause divided into its constituent relations, therefore it is
      not immediately apparent that do is in fact phonologically part of the preceding main clause. These
      sentences have the structure [CLAUSE I + do] + COMPLEMENT ClAUSE .
1 74                                                                                  CHAPTER 10   Examples 1 0.43 and 1 0.44 differ from sentences like 10.42 above. In 10.42 the object is a
non-specific noun suk 'thing' . However, in examples 10.43 and 10.44 the object, in these
examples the pronouns men 'welus' and ji 'lime' , is quite specific. In example 1 0.44, for
instance, the absence of the indirect object preposition is indicates that the pronoun ji is
actually the object.
   10.42     Yen    kendo men do         men gwat men hi          suk   e           men grem.
             people call     l PL COM l PL bring l PL poss things and               l PL put
             They called us to bring our things and leave (them there).
   10.43     An    syogat j i     do j i     so   nyom            wa an.
             3sG order      l SG COM l SG buy machete             for 3sG
             He told me to buy a machete for him.
   Both of these above examples are referred to later in this chapter under § 1 0.4. The
transitive verbs involved, kendo 'call' and syogat 'order' , belong to a predicate type that is
capable of taking complement clauses both with and without a complementiser.","[185, 186]"
"
1 1 .2.3 CONSTITUENT STATUS OF Sa ANDyo
   When both of these 'tensed' conjunctions mark a sentence they modify the first clause of
the sentence only. Thus these sentences have the following structure:
                                 [CLAUSE 1 + sa / yo] + CLAUSE 2
   Because a single clause cannot be modified by a grammatical category 'tense ' , sa and yo
are considered subordinating conjunctions. These 'tensed' conjunctions behave differently to
other Abun conjunctions in that they are postpositional. Prepositional and compounding
conjunctions such as we 'because ' and wo 'but' do not behave this way. This is to be
expected since Abun is a language with svo word order and has prepositions. The 'tensed' or
temporal conjunctions sa and yo depart from this. In fact in vo word-order languages
generally ""the connecting morpheme appears clause-initially        in the following clause""
                                                                      -
(Givon 1 990:889). These conjunctions being postpositional illustrate characteristics often
found in ov languages. Because these two conjunctions show a difference in syntactic
behaviour to other Abun conjunctions they are considered to be in a separate subclass to the
others.
   The two final examples show clearly that while both conjunctions have several meanings
in Abun, the predominant meaning is to give a time setting to the sentences concerned. The
first clause of each sentence is almost identical to the other except for the choice of
conjunction. The meaning difference is that the events expressed by example 1 1 .36 had at
that stage not yet taken place (being in the middle of a narrative); whereas sentence 1 1 .37
(given earlier as example 1 1 .20) expresses events already concluded and is in fact a
summary statement at the end of the same narrative. Therefore it is by the means of two
subordinating conjunctions that hearers can identify the time settings of Abun sentences.

             PREPOSITIONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS12. 1 INTRODuCTION
   In the previous chapter adverbial subordinate clauses, which were linked to the larger
sentence by means of postpositional conjunctions, were described. In Abun, clauses are
linked to form complex sentences in one of three ways-by means of postpositional
conjunctions, by means of prepositional conjunctions or by means of compounding
conjunctions. Clause types in Abun can be classified according to which type of conjunction
is used, rather than a subordinatelcoordinate distinction which depends upon clause-internal
syntactic differences. In this chapter, the usage of prepositional conjunctions and
compounding conjunctions within sentences will be described. These types are grouped
together according to their common syntactic properties. Table 1 2 . 1 below outlines these
groups and lists the common syntactic features that distinguish them from each other. There
are a small number of conjunctions which do not fit neatly into these three groups. These
'exceptions' have not been included in Table 12. 1 but are also discussed in this chapter.","[213, 214, 215]"
"   It could be said that if only a single noun phrase can constitute the direct object, as in the
above examples, this would confirm the analysis that only a part of the embedded clause
functions as the direct object. However these sentences show that for Abun sentence
structure only a single constituent division follows the predicate. This single division consists
of the direct object. There is a single division only, rather than two constituent divisions
following the predicate as is posited by the alternative analysis. If it is assumed that there are
two constituents which follow the predicate in these cases--one a direct object and the other a
truncated clause-we are left with determining the constituent status of these truncated
clauses. In some languages like English, it is possible to have reduced subordinate clauses
which have no overt subject as in the following: ' Having eaten the hamburger, he got on with
the rest of his work' . However Abun does not appear to have subjectless subordinate
clauses. If example 1 0.66 is considered again,
              Men yo        nyu-wa   men mu ki.          suk-du     re        nde.
              I pL NEG   fear-TRs I pL go         say NOM-say       this      NEG
              We are not afraid to go and tell this story.what is the status of mu ki sukdu re? Subjectless constituents like this do not exist elsewhere
in the language. There are occasions when a subject may be omitted. Sometimes in narratives
where the subject is the same or a number of events is given in quick succession, the subject
may be omitted.

                NEG get.away good        NEG struggle struggle LOC place one DEf just
                The young man struck (it) with the axe, (it) could not get away at all. The
                stream was dry, and (it was) shallow, (and it) could not get away at all, (it) was
                just struggling, struggling in one place.
   In both these examples there are several clauses where the subject was omitted. In both
cases the omitted subject was not in the immediate context of the clauses concerned. The
omitted subject was given several clauses earlier. In example 1 0.69 the omitted subject
'people' was given only two clauses preceding. However, in example 1 0.70 the omitted
subject is 'eel' and is given four clauses prior to the first which takes 'eel' as its subject. It
can be seen that in Abun omitted subjects occur only in certain types of narrative, particularly
where these subjects have several actions attributed to them. In these instances the subjects
are omitted from either simple clauses or coordinate clauses. These clauses are not
subjectless embedded clauses.2 7
   On this basis it is concluded that a subjectless subordinate clause is not a valid clause type
in Abun. A sentence having the constituent division SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT is quite common
in Abun. However, a sentence which has the constituent division
                                 SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT + (VERB + OBJECT)
is not. 28 In the above the embedded clause is subjectless.
   There are languages such as English which allow fronting of subordinate clauses.
Frequently, when a subordinate clause is fronted it consists of verb and object only.
However, in Abun it is not possible to front any subordinate or embedded clause. Since

   In Abun, the constituent termed mood is an element of the clause expressed through the
means of a clause-final particle. The indicative mood is unmarked. One interesting feature of
the mood particles is the use of two particles as a linked pair to indicate interrogation. In a
simi lar way, negation of indicative sentences uses a linked pair of particles. In Abun, the
strategy of using two particles (as opposed to one) is for the purpose of delineating
constituent boundaries. Thus the constituent 'interrogative' is marked by two particles, one
termed the initial question marker (IQM), occurring clause-initially and the other, the final
question marker (FQM), which ends or closes the interrogative. In modem usage the initial
question marker te appears to be optional, perhaps influenced by the national language,
Indonesian, which does not possess such a particle. The FQM differs according to the type of
interrogati ve.
   A table of the eight mood particles is listed below. For further information about mood
particles listed here see §6.

3 .4.6 INTERJECTIONS
   There are several interjections in Abun, such as mban! 'expression of surprise/alarm' (for
example, when a coconut falls nearby); mara! 'expression of disgust' (for example, when
someone doubts the integrity of another person, this interjection would begin a defence); and
bei! 'expression of surprise ' . According to Schachter ( 1 985: 58), ""The class of interjections
often includes words which are phonologically distinctive"". However, in contrast to this,
those interjections observed so far fit within the regular phonological patterns of the language.
                                           CHAPTER 4
                                   CLAUSE STRUCTURE   The focus of thjs chapter is the structure of an Abun main clause. Firstly, some comments
are made about the core grammar and grammatical relations (§4. 1 ) followed by a note on
how the grammatical relations hierarchy relates to Abun (§4.2). A discussion of clause types
(§4.3), peripheral constituents, which are labelled here adjuncts (§4.4), and clause-final
particles (§4.S) completes the picture of the Abun verbal main clause. In §4.6, Abun verbless
clauses are djscussed.
   A feature of Abun clauses is their fairly rigid word order, especially in the core, but also in
the periphery. The acceptable variations are limited. There are several syntactic information­
packaging options in Abun clauses such as de-focusing, topicalisation and cleft-like
constructions, which are discussed in §4.7.","[58, 59, 60]"
"
10.3 . 1 .2 NEGATION OFCOMPLEX SENTENCES
   It has already been shown in regard to negative raising (§ 1 0.2.5) that a clause can be
shown to be subordinate by the placement of the negative particle nde. If a main clause is to
be negated, the negative particle nde occurs only after any subordinate clause which may be
embedded in that main clause. Example 10.57 (given earlier as 10.53) is an example of this
and has a manipulative verb (verb with -gat suffix) in the main clause.
     10.57      Men yo      wergat ye- wis        yi      ben-bot suk             re    nde.
                I PL NFG force      PERs-kind other do-about thing               this   NFG
                We do not force other tribes to do these things.
   Example 10.58 below shows the other type of verb under consideration here, verbs which
may take -wa suffix and where the pattern of negation is the same. The subordinate clause, in
these cases complement clauses which do not have a complementiser, is within the
grammatical scope of the main clause negation.
     10.58      Men yo      nyu-wa men mu k i              suk-du        re     nde.
                I PL NFG fear-TRs I PL go            say NOM-say         this   NFG
                We are not afraid to go and tell this story.
   The syntax of these examples indicates that these types of complement are in fact
subordinate because the final negative particle nde occurs after the complement. In order to
create two separate assertions in Abun, each clause would need to have both negative
particles in the correct positions, using a total of four particles in all rather than the two only
that are used in these examples. The presence and position of only two negative particles here
indicates that only one verb in the sentence has been negated, the verb of the main clause.
Therefore the second clause must be an embedded clause because the position of the second
negative particle nde indicates that this clause is included within the scope of the main clause
negation. Because there are only two negative particles there can be only one sentence here.
Therefore on the basis of the structure of the indicative negative, these complement clauses
are subordinate. 2 5
25     The placement of the final negative particle is also significant in another way. In the simple Abun
       clause only aspect particles or interrogative particles may follow the final negative particle.
       Therefore a constituent such as 'adjunct' may not follow after the negative particle. Thus the
       constituent structure given for these sentences cannot include an adjunct and is limited to the
       pattern SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECf .
COMPLEMENJ CU!USES                                                                               18110.3 . 1 .3 TRANSITIVE NATURE OF TIlE -wa SUfFIX
   The purpose of the -wa suffix is to indicate that a part of speech, usually a verb that is not
normally transitive, is transitive in the utterance given. Therefore -wa changes the valency of
the verb from having only one argument to two. Usually -wa changes stative verbs into
transitive verbs and some of these, namely fwa 'want', bariwa 'do not want' and nyuwa 'be
afraid of' , are capable of taking the types of complements under discussion here. Any verb
which has the -wa suffix is transitive even if the object is not overtly stated. The following
examples indicate this:
   10.59     Nu nyu nde.
             2PL fear NEG
             Don ' t fear.
   1 0.60    Nu nyu- wa           men 0          nde.
             2PL fear-TRS                  NEG

ADVERBIAL CLA USES                                                                                     191            b. John chopped the wood and carried it to his house. 3D
   Example I L I a above consists of a subordinate temporal clause and an independent
clause. The first clause is marked as subordinate in English by means of the participial verb
form, the use of the conjunction 'after' and the absence of the subject. Example 1 1 . 1 b i s
given a s an example o f a 'coordinate construction' (Longacre 1 985:239). Longacre's
comment on these sentences, quoted above, is to the effect that a clause-chaining language
does not permit two different syntactic variants, as is possible in English. Only one i s
possible. Abun is not a clause-chaining language. However, the influence o f Papuan clause­
chaining languages can be seen when Longacre's examples are translated into Abun. The
translations are given below as 1 1 .2a and 1 1 .2b respectively. There is little syntactic
difference between these two examples.
     1 1 .2 a.   Yohanes pet     kwe-gu      or-ete       an     gwat rnu rna an          hi     nu.
                 John     split tree-dry after-then 3sG carry OlR to               3sG    poss house
                 After John chopped the wood he carried it to his house.
            b.   Yohanes pet      kwe-gu      ete         an     gwat rnu rna an          hi   nu.
                 John      split tree-dry and.then 3sG bring OlR to 3sG                   POSS house
                 John chopped the fire wood and then carried it to his house.
   It can be seen by comparing these Abun sentences that there is no distinct subordinate
marking on the verb of the first clause in example 1 1 .2a, which might distinguish this clause
as a subordinate clause; neither is there a subordinate conj unction equivalent to 'after' . Abun
or 'after' is an adverb which, in 1 1 .2a, compounds with the sequential conjunction ete 'and
then ' . Abun does not have an exact meaning equivalent for the English coordinate
conj unction ' and' . In fact the only difference between these two examples regarding
constituent structure is the addition of or 'after' to the conjunction ete in example 1 1 .2a. If
the conj unctions orete and ete were removed from these examples, all four remaining
clauses would be good, freestanding independent clauses in Abun.
   Therefore it appears that in common with languages of the clause-chaining type, Abun
lacks an obvious subordinate/coordinate distinction as found in Indo-European languages.
Many of the clause-chaining languages of the world are found on the island of New Guinea.
In a clause-chaining language (Longacre 1985:264)
       There is a clause (characteristically final in a chain of clauses) that has a verb of
       distinctive structure that occurs but once in the entire chain while other (typically
       non-final) clauses have verbs of different structure . . .Each non-final clause is
       marked so as to indicate whether the fol lowing clause has same subject or
       different subject from itself.
   An example from a clause-chaining language, Kanite of Papua New Guinea, is given
below. Because of its length, it has been abbreviated from the original example given in
Longacre ( 1 985 :266).
                 (1)   his-u 'a-ke- 'ka
                       do-we-os-you
3D    It could be argued that strictly speaking the second clause of Longacre' s example here cannot
      stand on its own because the pronoun has been omitted. In the Abun translation given later, this i s
      certainly not the case a s it i s necessary t o repeat the pronoun.
192                                                                                            CHAPTER l l

                       men will fi nish making the fence.
     In this example, abbreviated from eight clauses to the four given here, a transition marker,
ke 'os different subject', indicates a change of subject in the clause which i s to follow. The
final verb of this sentence nehis- has a distinctive form that i s different from when it is non­
final , as in the initial clause where it occurs as his-.
   These languages usually mark, within the clause chain, the notions of temporal overlap (or
simultaneity) and temporal succession (or sequence) as well as marking change of subject
(switch reference) (Longacre 1985 :267). Abun, a West Papuan language, does not have the
verb morphology typical of a clause-chaining language. Nevertheless the notions of
simultaneity and sequence are strongly marked on Abun complex sentences) l These
features of the neighbouring Papuan languages have had some influence on Abun sentence
structure. It is the author's opinion that just as clause-chaining languages do not have a clear­
cut subordinate/coordinate distinction which is syntactically marked in complex sentences,
neither does the Abun language. This also is a Papuan areal feature still evident in Abun,
even though Abun verb morphology has more in common with Austronesian languages.
Therefore the adverbial clauses discussed in this and the following chapter can only be
considered as 'adverbial' subordinate clauses by semantic means; there is scarce syntactic
marking to indicate subordinate status.
   Traditionally, a discussion of the 'adverbial ' subordinate clauses of a language would
subdivide clauses on the basis of the semantic relationships expressed between the clauses
such as time, location, reason, condition. In this discussion we prefer to group clause types
according to common syntactic properties, as well as considering semantic similarities. In
this and the following chapter adverbial clauses are not grouped together as subordinate
clauses which contrast syntactically with coordinate clauses. Rather, these clauses are
differentiated according to the type of conjunction that is used to link them. In Abun,
conjunctions divide into three main types-postpositional, prepositional and compounding.","[202, 203, 204]"
"
10.3. 1 . 1 ABUN VERB MORPHOLOGY
   Applying traditional labels such as infinitive or participial to Abun is difficult. Since Abun
lacks subject-verb agreement and various other means by which the verb may be marked,
the structural definitions that are applied to complement types of other languages (synthetic
rather than isolating languages) cannot be applied to Abun. In Abun the morphological shape
of the verb never changes. It is invariant. There are no verb participles in Abun so it is not
possible to have a participial complement. Neither is there an infinitive in Abun.
   Determining what an infinitive is for Abun is somewhat difficult in that such definitions
are usually based on variations of the basic verb, showing person-number marking of the
subject. As has already been stated the Abun verb is invariant since changes to aspect and
mood are carried by particles and subject-verb agreement is not marked in Abun. If an
infinitive is said to be a verb that is 'not able to take a subject NP' , this definition is also
problematic because verbs in Abun normally take a subject P. In Abun, verbs are never said
in isolation. For example, if an enquiry is made as to the Abun terms for such words as
'come' and 'go' the reply is always given using a personal pronoun, usually second person
singular. Therefore 'come' would be given as nan rna 'you come' and 'go' would be given
as na rnu 'you go' . An infinitive cannot be elicited because such a verbal form does not exist.
On some occasions the overt subject of a clause may be omitted, but this is an option the
speaker has and is not obligatory. Predicates which take the -wa suffix may allow the subject
of the complement clause to be elided if it is co-referential with the subject of the main
clause. For example:
   10.56     Ji i-wa          da      ron        a-reo
             l sG happY-TRs drink medicine Foc-this
             I am happy to (or agree to) take some medicine now.
   This type of ellipsis is not common, as it i s more usual that the subject is repeated. In
either case the form of the verb is the same whether there is a subject NP or not. Therefore it
is not possible to determine what is an infinitive verb form in Abun. Since Abun verb
morphology is always invariant it cannot be stated that Abun has a separate infinitive verb
form. Neither does it have a participial form. It follows then that because Abun has no verbal
infinitives, neither can it have infinitive complements. Therefore, this means of encoding a
complement clause by means of distinctive verb morphology is not applicable for Abun .
Because changes to verb morphology within the complement clause cannot identify
complement types, other methods need to be used.
   Giv6n did not list any other means of syntactically encoding a complement clause. The
various means that he has described, with the exception of the ""subordinating morpheme"",
are all means of identifying the complement clause as such by some type of syntactic
marking within the complement clause itself. These means have proved unproductive for
Abun. Noonan ( 1 985 :44), like Giv6n, lists various ways of identifying complement clauses
one being ""the external syntactic relations of the complement construction as a whole"". It
seems that for Abun the only way of identifying complement clauses is not from inside the
embedded complement clause but from outside of it. One such means is the
1 80                                                                                          CHAPTER 10complementiser. If there is no complementiser, as in the cases under discussion here, there is
other evidence external to the complement clause which can indicate that it is embedded
within the main clause. There are various structural indications of subordination in Abun .
Two of them will be given here to provide evidence that these complement clauses are, in
fact, subordinate to the main clause as embedded objects. The first deals with the structure of
a negative sentence; the second concerns the transitive implications of the suffixes on the
main clause verbs found in these types of construction.","[191, 192]"
"   The form bot has in many cases become combined with verbs. The resultant forms have a
different semantic scope when compared to the uninflected forms, for example wat
'separate' and watbot 'examine' in examples 3.17 and 3. 1 8 . The uninflected wat means
'separate' , while watbot contains the perlative notion of separating about or along a particular
path.

3.3. 1 .3 'fHE ORAMMATICAUSATION OFket
    Ket also follows the same grarnmaticalisation procedure as bot and wa. The free form ket
is a LOCATIVE preposition. It precedes the location of the path of the action. For example, the
location where goods were being carried in example 3.20 is along the ground, that is by foot,
and the location of the path of the cutting across in example 3 . 2 1 was towards the interior
(rather than the sea).
   3.20      Men sam       suk      ket bur.
             I PL carry things LOC earth
             We carried the things, walking along.
   3.21      Men tot ket nden.
             1 PL cut LOC interior
             We cut across to the interior (path).
   As stated above, objects are frequently omitted in Abun, resulting in the preposition ke t
being adjacent to a verb. This has resulted in the combining of some verbs with ket with a
subsequent semantic shift. The free form ket occurs adjacent to the verbs mu 'go ' , ti 'stand' ,
tot 'cut ' , and e 'fall over' , but there is no evidence of semantic shift or change of prosody in
these cases, so ket remains as a free form and is not affixed to these verbs. However, ket has
become a suffix in the case of the two adjectives mbrin 'unconscious' in example 3.22 and
ye 'difficult' in example 3.23. This is clear because of both prosody and significant meaning
changes in these two examples. Another example of a change of meaning is the suffixation
of -ket with the verb ki 'say ' . The resultant word is ki-ket 'slander' .

   The free form gat 'to spear, join' i s a regular verb as in example 3 . 24, and it also behaves
as an adverb meaning that an action is done with intensity or penetratingly. In example 3 . 25,
gat signifies that the act of entering new students of witchcraft into the training house was not
just at its old pace, but that now there was a new emphasis on doing it, and that emphasis
was more intense.
     3.24    Musa gat      nok.

     Adverbs follow the object in Abun clauses. Since objects are frequently elided, the adverb
often directly follows the verb, just like the prepositions wa, bot and keto Some verbs and
nouns undergo prosody and semantic changes when they co-occur with the adverb gat, and
so they coalesce. In these cases, the semantic changes are not always equal to the
compositional meaning of the components. However, the inflected verbs do have notions of
intensity or pressure. The conversion of status from a free form (the adverb) to an inflection
on the verb is clear due to prosody and semantic changes. In example 3 . 26, the verb wer 'to
try (to seduce) ' combines with -gat to form wer-gat 'make a determined effort, work hard
at' . Likewise the verb ki 'speak' , combined with -gat, forms kigat 'speak persuasively ' .
Furthermore, the verb i '(be) sick' combines to form i-gat ' (be) frequently sick' i n example
3 .27.
     3.26    An    wer-gat     an    baca.
             3sG push-INT 3SG read
             Slhe pushed herselflhimself intensely to be able to ready.
     3. 27   An     yo    i-gat     saga nyim        nde reo
             3sG NEG sick-INf like          before NEG PERF
             She is not always sick like she had been.
   An alternative analysis is to consider this as word compounding, where it is actually the
verb gat that is coalescing with another verb. Sentences like example 3.28 show that indeed
both the verb and adverb gat can occur in the one clause. The verb makes clear that they are
spearing each other and the adverb conveys the manner in which they were doing it. In fact,
ndi and gat in example 3.28 are not compounding; rather both verbs stand alone on prosody
grounds, and there is certainly no change of compositional meaning compared to each verb's
meaning when they occur in this way. This i s a case of serial verbs. In contrast to this, when
the adverb and a verb co-occur coalescence results. So in example 3.29, the -gat in ndi-gat
refers to the intensity of fighting. Instead of an independent stress centre on each morpheme
the primary stress is on -gat, according to the stress patterns found in Abun words.
     3 .28   An    w e ndi      gat     yu           gat.
             3PL two fight spear each.other INf
             They (two) fought, spearing each other furiously.

              3PL two fight-tNT
              They (two) fought furiously.
   A few nouns have also combined with -gat to fonn verbs, such as: syim-gat 'hand-tNT: to
start' and syo-gat ' mouth-INT: to order' .
    3 .30     Pilot syim-gat kaparok uk                 satu o.

syaugat 'to command' occurs, but syau does not.","[40, 41, 42, 43]"

5.2 NOUN PHRASES
   An Abun noun phrase typically has the following structure:                               HEAD (MODIFIERS) (DETERMrNER)
    The head of a noun phrase is normally filled by a member of the noun word class as in
example 5 . 10, but may also be filled by a pronoun, as in 5. 1 1 , with a restricted set of
modifiers. In other words, other nouns and adjectives do not co-occur with a pronoun when
it is head of a noun phrase; only classifiers, quantifiers and determiners may co-occur with
pronouns, as seen in 5 . 1 1 .

                   The white dog had completely eaten the two fish.
     5. 1 1        A n ka w e n e           git boge.
                   3PL CL two OEf           eat fish
                   Those two ate fish.
   A proper name will usually occur alone, but may be modified by a relative clause, as seen
in example 5 . 12.
     5.12          Mauren      gato       kwop re...
                   Mauren   REI..  die     recently
                   Mauren who had died recently ...
   Modifiers are optional. The types, their order and co-occurrence restrictions are discussed
below in §5.2. 1 .
   Determiners, like modifiers, are optional. They are used less frequently than determiners
are in English. They will be discussed in §5.2.2 below.
  Since modifiers and determiners are optional, frequently a noun phrase consists of a single
noun. For example:
     5.13          Fredik     bari-wa          git     yetu.
                   Fredik not.want-TRs eat people
                   Fredik does not want to eat people.
    Noun phrases fill subject and object positions, as seen in the examples below. They also
fill head positions in possessive and prepositional phrases and these will be discussed in §5.3
and §5.4 respectively.
     5. 1 4        Men dakai git nok                 ku        koi bok     yo.

6   Lyons ( 1 968 :3 1 7) noted that in some languages these concepts may merge into one another. In
    attempting to define the precise meaning of the predicate markers they can be loosely described a s
    falling into this broad area.

3.4.4 PROFORMS
   Abun has three subclasses of proforms                including      pronouns,      prosentences,     and
interrogative proforms.
    There is only one set of pronouns in Abun which is used for subject, object and possessor
and is listed in Table 3 . 1 4 below. There is significant dialectal variation, with the three main
dialects being distinguished by their first person singular pronoun. In addition to dual forms
trial and greater are possible. Thus me-ka-gri ' we three' or an-ka-at 'they four' are
frequently used in story telling.

                  non-human         i-
   In addition to the above pronouns, Abun has a reciprocal pronoun, yu, and two reflexive
forms, dakai and wadigan. These modify the appropriate pronoun above and yu. For further
details regarding the distinction between these two see §5.2. 1 . The same form of this
pronoun is used for all persons.
   The Abun prosentence subclass consists of one member, which i s also the pri mary
negation particle, nde. This word is used to answer questions with a 'no' and, as such, is
equivalent to a negative sentence. Affirmative answers use an echo system rather than a
prosentence (see §6. 1 for more details).
   There are three members of the interrogative proforms subclass, namely u 'which ' ,
suma 'what' and o t 'how many ' . These forms combine with other words to create
interrogative expressions such as, mo u 'ux: which: where' and kam ot 'day how .many:
when' . For more detail s see §6. 1 .4.","[55, 56, 57]"

4.3.3 DITRANSITIVE CLAUSES
   Ditransitive clauses include verbs that require three arguments such as syo 'give ' , kadum
'show' and hi ' send ' . They are constructed in a sirrular way to transitive clauses but also
include an obligatory dative prepositional phrase as the third argument. A ditransitive clause
consi sts of:
                                    SUBJECr + VERB + OBJECr + DATIVE
   The dative argument here is obligatory. It is filled by a prepositional phrase that begins
with the preposition is (Abun Ji) or nai, dialectal variant (Abun Yerrat), and it usually
precedes other types of prepositional phrases, as seen in examples 4. 1 0 and 4. 1 1 .
     4. 10    M en    kadum men          hi     tiket is ye-suk-mise.
              I PL    show     I PL      pass ticket to PERs-NoM-evil
              SUBJECT VERB     OBJECT                 DATIVE
              We showed our tickets to the police.
     4. 1 1   Nggon n e syo           suk-ne     nai    an   hi        1m     mo      nu.

              That girl gave those things to her mother at home.
   Frequently the object is orrutted where it is understood from the context. In example 4. 1 2
the object, 'three plates ' , i s elided from the second clause. This i s possible because it is
recoverable from the context that three plates were given to Isak. In the same way the indirect
object itself, when recoverable from the context, can be elided, except for the preposition. In
example 4. 1 3 it i s clear that the third person singular referred to in the first clause i s the
recipient of the ginger.
     4. 1 2   An       nai     hrek gri,       an         syo    is   Isak.
              3SG      get     plate three 3SG            give to     Isak

   Adj uncts express spatio-temporal settings of events and other secondary participants and
information not contained in the core arguments. Adj uncts are distinguished from the core
arguments by syntactic positioning outside of the core and by marking with prepositions.
Adj uncts of a clause are therefore typically filled by adverbial phrases (see §4.4. 1 ) and
prepositional phrases (see §4.4.2).","[64, 65]"

interrogative sentences, negative descriptive and location sentences and in the negation of

the primary negative particle nde. These two particles form a linked pair that bracket the
predicate of the sentence. The particle yo always occurs between a subject and predicate. The
word order is rigid.",[147]

6. 1 . 1 YES/NO QUESTIONS
   There are many characteristics that distinguish yes/no questions from other structures in
the world's languages. Characteristics listed by Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985 : 1 8 1 ) in order of
frequency in their sample were: rising final intonation contour, a sentence-initial particle, a
sentence-final particle, special verb morphology and word order. Abun yes/no questions are
marked with an optional sentence-initial particle and an obigatory sentence-final particle.
   The structure of a YES/NO question in Abun is:                                         (te) CLAUSE e
  The Yes/No Question Marker e is always used in yes/no questions. However, the 'Initial
Question Marker' te is always optional and more often than not is omitted. Of those yes/no
questions studied, about 35% used te o Examples 6 . 1 and 6.2 illustrate typical yes/no
questions, showing that with or without te the meaning is the same.
   6 . 1 a.   Te    nan kra        it     e?
              IQM 2sG marry        O\M       YNQ'v1

              Are you married?
   6 . 2 a.   Te   nan nai nan bi                 suk       it       e?

              2sG get 2sG poss things                 O\M   YNQ'v1
              Have you got your things?
    One of the most striking characteristics of yes/no questions noted by researchers is a
rising-final intonation contour (Sadock & Zwicky 1985: 1 8 1 ). An analysis of the intonation
patterns in Abun yes/no questions reveals the opposite, that is a falling final intonation
contour. The intonation pattern for interrogati ve sentences is the same as that for indicative
sentences. Therefore intonation is not such a significant distinguishing feature of yes/no
questions in Abun as it is in many other languages. Ultan ( 1 978:230) points out that in his
79-language sample, those languages that had prepositions always had a rising terminal
MARKED MOODS                                                                                  1 03contour intonation pattern. Abun is clearly an exception to this (see Figures 6. 1 and 6.2 below
which contrast yes/no and confirmative question intonation patterns).
   There are three basic systems for short answers to yes/no questions: yes/no,
agree/disagree and echo systems. Abun speakers use a mixture of these systems: an echo
system for positive responses; and a negative particle, nde, for negative responses. They do
not have both positive and negative particles for answering like the English 'yes' and 'no ' ,
but rather they only have the negative particle. When a question such a s that in example 6 . 3 i s
asked, a positive answer would be the echo, 'There is cooked food ' . Frequently such answers
may be shortened even further, a possible response to 6.3 being rna 'there i s ' . A negative
response would require the use of nde 'no ' .
   6.3       A     kon   suk    a            yo   jon    e?
             2sG cook thing PAUSE            some cooked YI'Q\1
             Have you cooked anything?
   Although Abun speakers use an echo system for positive responses, their body-language

7. 1 ASPECT
   The notion of aspect, according to Comrie ( 1 976: 1 -3), tends to be a less familiar notion to
students of linguistics than other terms for verbal categories. In order to define the term, he
firstly distinguishes it from tense. He points out that ""aspects are different ways of viewing
the internal temporal constituency of a situation"". Lyons ( 1 968:3 1 5) also distinguishes tense
from aspect by noting that tense has to do with the location in time of an action or state,
whereas aspect has to do with the distribution of time or contour of an action or state. He
claims that the main aspectual notions of 'completion' and 'duration' are found in many
languages.
    Abun uses particles to express aspectual notions. The notion of 'completion ' is expressed
by two particles, re and it, while the notion of 'incompleteness' is expressed by the particle
to. When these optional particles occur, they follow negative markers, where present, but
precede mood and modality particles.",[134]
"
32   It may appear confusing to use Foley' s definition of the terms REA LIS and IRREALIS since these terms
     are often used to describe not tense, but mood (for example see Giv6n 1 984:255). However,
     Foley's term 'status' which he divides further into 'realis' and 'irrealis' closely approximates the
     semantic distinction between the two postpositional conjunctions sa and yo .
1 94                                                                                      CHAPTER 1 11 1 .2. 1 THE REALIS CONJUNCTION sa
   When a language indicates the temporal setting of events expressed within clauses it may
do so by a formal grammatical category tense, by time words or a combination of both
strategies. In regard to complex sentences, tense as a category may be marked within the
component clauses and particular conjunctions may convey particular 'marked' time
meanings, such as 'before ' , 'after' , 'as ' , and 'while' . The Abun conjunction sa carries the
grammatical information of 'realis', but in relation to specific time concepts is unmarked.
Thus it could be considered a general time subordinator and translated into English as
'when.REALIS' . Sa indicates that the clauses it joins are in realis time setting. By usage of sa
hearers know that the connected events expressed by the clauses are in the past, that they
have already occurred. When clauses are joined by sa, speakers usually pause after sa,
indicating that sa is considered to be part of the preceding clause. Nevertheless sa is still a
conjunction or means of joining two clauses in Abun. It is not possible to end a sentence
with sa. Therefore clauses marked by sa are dependent temporal clauses in the same way as
the English 'when' clause. Sa i s a sentence-medial subordinating conj unction and i s a
constituent of the first clause of a complex sentence which has the following structure:
                                      [CLAUSE 1 + sa] + CLAUSE 2
   The following examples are typical of the way sa is used in Abun:
   1 1 .3     Men kern rno        karnpung     sa            Rahel     hi     ai     farkor an.
              I PL stay i n    village      when.REAL Rachel poss father teach                 3sG
              When we stayed in the village, Rachel ' s father taught her.
   1 1 .4    Mensern rnonekret             Marten sa                Marten rna      karn Selasa.
              I PL sleep there wait.for Marten when.REAL Marten come                day     Tuesday
              We slept there, waiting for Marten and he came on Tuesday.
   As a general time subordinator the range of meanings conveyed by sa is wide. Sa is a
temporal link between clauses and as such can be used to indicate the following range of
meanings:
                  ( 1 ) precedence            whenlbefore
                  (2) subsequence             when/after
                  (3) simultaneity            when/while
                  (4) point coincidence       when/as/, just then
   Giv6n describes a general subordinator such as sa as being semantically ' less marked' .
Conj unctions such as 'before ' , ' after' , 'while' and the like are considered to indicate 'specific
temporal relations' . Therefore Giv6n ( 1 990:828) considers that ""Such less-marked coding
strategy is successful when the semantic specificity of the temporal relation can be inferred
from other features of the two clauses - most commonly from the verb and its tense-aspect.""
Since in Abun the conjunction itself indicates the 'tense' or time setting, it is not necessary to
use other means in order to indicate the specific temporal relation concerned. In the examples
below the extent of temporal relations that sa can convey is shown together with more
specific means of indicating these.

               1 . When we carried (them) up to the house, three (fish) had already died.
               2. By the time we reached the house three had already died.

               1 . When I came he had not yet arrived.
               2. By the time I came he had not yet arrived.
   The above examples indicate temporal precedence, which in many languages is indicated
by a specific time word meaning 'before ' . Abun has no single word which can be translated
as 'before ' . Instead the negative particle nde combined with the incompletive aspect particle
to are used to indicate 'not yet'. In the above examples there are two further means of
inferring the time relation in addition to the conjunction itself. Example 1 1 .5 has the second
clause marked by the perfect aspect particle) 3 In example 1 1 .6 the temporal precedence
relation is more explicitly marked by nde to 'not yetlbefore' again on the second clause.
These particles may behave as a conjunction without the need for the general subordinator sa.
If used in a clause within a complex sentence nde to has the specific meaning of 'before ' .
For example:
     1 1 .7    Tepsu         gane j i   yo fa i  Apner nde to,   Apner                      dam

               NEG know Iso NEG
               1 . At that time before I knew Apner, he did not know me either.
               2. At that time I did not yet know Apner, he did not know me either.","[205, 206, 207]"

10.4.4 KNOWLEDGE PREDICATES
   The predicate jam 'knowlhear/understand' also may be considered a Type 3 predicate in
that it may occur with or without a complementiser. However, this verb is structurally
different in that it does not have an object immediately preceding the complement clause
constituent, as is the case with the other Type 3 predicates. If jam has the meaning 'know ' it
is more likely to use the complementiser in conjunction with the complement clause. If jam29     In particular predicates such as 'know' , 'lie' and 'call' which Giv6n terms 'Perception-Cognition­
       Utterance' predicates 'no co-reference with any argument in the main clause' is required in English
       (Giv6n 1 993: 1 6).
COMPLEMENT CUUSES                                                                                       1 89has the meaning 'hear' it appears not to use the complementiser. The following examples
illustrate these possibilities:
   10.81     Ji    jam k w e       mbrur kwe-nat        kra            kagit as        ma   it.
             l sG hear wood snap tree-leaves crackle from path DIR CAM
             I heard wood snapping and leaves crackling coming from the path.
   10.82     An    jam     an      baca   kuru! dik         kuru! dik.
             3sG know 3sG read         letter one letter               one
             She knew (how) to read one letter at a time.
   10.83     Ji    jam     do      sangge nau               re        dam suk- ibit.
             l sG know COM true              palm.wine this also NOM-bad
             I know that it is true, this palm wine is also a bad thing.
   The following example is interesting in that it contains both types of complement clause
within the one sentence. There is an embedded complement clause which i s the object of the
predicate jam 'hear' . This embedded clause contains yet another complement which, in this
case, consists of the complementiser in conjunction with a complement clause.
   1 0. 84   Ji    jam an         ke      it     do     ""yesyim yesyim nan kas                    kekro "".

             I heard him calling out, ""Friend! Friend! Run quickly ! ""
10.5 MORE ON MANIPULATIVE PREDICATES
   Earlier in § 1 O.3 manipulative predicates which made use of the suffix -gat were
discussed. These predicates did not make use of the complementiser and the complements
were analysed as embedded objects. However, the manipulative verb ben 'do/make' was not
discussed because it is considered to be a predicate or a different type. Frequently ben has the
meaning of 'do' and so cannot be considered manipulative. B ut when ben has the meaning
of 'make' it can be used as a manipulative predicate. With this verb, as with other
manipulative predicates, the complementiser i s never used. The following examples are
typical:
   1 0.85    Nan m e      su-ga        ben      an     bi        pa       i    ne.
             2sG see thing-REL make 3sG ross child                        sick DEI'
             You see the thing that has made (his) child sick.
   10.86     An    ben     motor ne       kru    reo
             3sG make motor that          sink PERF
             He made that motor sink.
    These complements have a similar structure to those that were termed predicate Type 2. In
keeping with the structural analysis discussed earlier, here also the entire complement clause
is considered to be the object of the main clause.
   Since examples from all of the predicate types have been discussed fully, this concludes
the discussion of Abun complement clauses.
                                           CHAPTER 1 1
                                  ADVERBIAL CLAUSES1 1 . 1 lNTRODUCfION
   Various terms are used to describe how, within a single sentence, clauses interact to form
a meaningful unit. Terms such as 'interclausal coherence' (Givon 1 990), 'relationships
within the clause complex' (Halliday 1 985) and even 'clause combining' (Matthiessen &
Thompson 1 988) are among recent descriptions of what has been traditionally termed
subordination. Traditionally, as Thompson and Longacre ( 1 985: 1 72) state, three types of
subordinate clause have been distinguished:
      those which function as noun phrases (called complements) [=noun clauses],
      those which function as modifiers of nouns (relative clauses), and those which
      function as modifiers of verb phrases or entire propositions (called adverbial
      clauses).
Relative clauses and noun clauses have been described in the earlier Chapters 9 and 10. In
this chapter we will begin a discussion of the third kind of subordinate clause, ' adverbial
clauses' , as they are found in Abun.
   Adverbial subordinate clauses are said to modify a sentence in the same way that an
adverb modifies a verb. Since the sentences that contain these subordinate clauses consist
minimally of two clauses, one clause could be termed the Head and the other the Modifier
(Halliday 1 985 : 1 92). Usually one clause, often termed the main clause, is said to be
grammatically 'free' or independent. As such it can stand on its own as a single clause. The
subordinate clause is marked in some way, such as by means of verbal inflection, to indicate
that it is 'bound' or dependent and thus cannot stand alone as a single clause. Languages that
permit clauses to be joined in this way normally permit an alternative, termed coordination.
In these cases the clauses, although joined together in some way, may stand on their own as
independent clauses. However, there is another quite different type of ""interclausal
grammatical organization"" (to use Givon ' s terminology 1 990: 864). This type is known as
'clause chaining' (Longacre 1985). Longacre states that languages of the clause-chaining
variety do not offer the grammatical options of subordinate-independent and coordinate
constructions. ''The subordinate/coordi nate distinction is irrelevant [in that there is no choice
between the two] and both are absorbed into the medial/final distinction."" (Longacre
1 985:239). To demonstrate this Longacre gives two English sentences which illustrate the
subordinatelcoordinate options of a language such as English. These sentences, given below
as I L I a and 1 1 . 1 b, would not be syntactically distinct in a language of the clause-chaining
type.

1 2.2 THE PREPOSmON AS CONJUNCfION
     Traditionally prepositions and conjunctions have been considered as two separate word
classes within a language. Recently Huddleston ( 1 984:338) has proposed, at least for
English, that prepositions and subordinating conjunctions be conflated into a single class
( 1 984:338). Some of the reasoning behind this ( 1 984:339) that is applicable to Abun as well
                                               203
204                                                                                      CHAPTER 12as English is that a number of these words ""enter into construction with either an NP or a
clause"". Abun prepositions behave like conjunctions in that a large number of the class of
prepositions have the ability to link a clause to a larger construction. Where they differ from
the other conjunction groups listed in Table 1 2 . 1 is in their ability to embed clauses within
larger units. It will be shown later that other conjunctions in Abun link independent clauses.
These conjunctions have been described as compounding conjunctions because of their
ability to create new forms and extend their range of meaning.
   The following Table 1 2.2 lists those Abun prepositions that behave also as conjunctions.
For some, when they are used to link a clause rather than an NP, their original meaning is
extended.

              su                with INSTRUMENT                with
     The majority of Abun prepositions may act as conjunctions. However, the general locative
mo 'at/in' can be used only in association with the relative clause marker gato. 37 Some of the
prepositions such as subot 'along' karowa 'close to/near' and su 'with' are not commonly
used as conj unctions. Examples of those that are more commonly used, both as prepositions
and as conjunctions, are given below:
(i) ' wa ' 'for/in order to'
     1 2. 1        An    fro       nu     yo    wa      men.
                   3SG prepare house DET(I) for         I PL

                   Marta cut some brer (leaves) and brought them back for us to eat our food on.
  The clause that follows the preposition wa in example 1 2.2 above is considered as a single
constituent. As discussed in Chapter 10 earlier, there is no non-finite form of the verb in
Abun, thus men git sugit mo represents a single clause.","[215, 216]"
"   1 0.6 1   *Nu nyu men 0                   nde.

             I thought that his magic was strong enough to kill me. So I was j ust afraid (of
             him).
   The significance of example 1 0.61 is that a stative verb like nyu 'fear' cannot take an
object unless the -wa has been added as in 10.60. Therefore example 10.6 1 is unacceptable
since an object fol lows the stative verb nyu. Frequently Abun speakers use verbs which have
had -wa added and omit the object which -wa implies. Normally the object is understood
from the immediate context. This is the case in example 10.62 above. The sentence preceding
the clause containing nyuwa 'be afraid of' has been given to show that the object is
understood or omitted. The implications of this for complement structures are that -wa
indicates that the verb must take an object and that, in these cases, the object is actually the
entire clause, as indicated in the example below:
   1 0.63    An      iowa             ji        si      an     mu        mo      nggwe.

             She wanted me to go with her to the garden .
    The structure of example 1 0.63 differs from that of 10.38, here repeated as 1 0.64. In
1 0.64 the complementiser and the complement clause are not the object of the verb { 'be
happy ' because { is an intransitive verb. Therefore the do- clause does not have the
grammatical relation of object (as shown in § 1 O.2.4 above).

must be understood as complements even though no complementisers are used. These
clauses are therefore embedded clauses.
   The other types of verb under consideration here are those which take the manipulative
suffix -gat. Besides wergat 'force/persuade' and krokgat 'stir.up ' , the verbs syogat 'order'
and syaugat 'command strongly' may also take embedded complements. Of these verbs
only wer 'seduce/persevere' exists as a separate verb form without the suffix. When wer has
the meaning 'to persevere' or 'to try to work out' it is an intransitive verb. However, when a
verb takes the -gat suffix it becomes transitive. Because the structure of the complement
clauses involved here is identical to those where the matrix clause verb has the -wa suffix, it
is reasonable to posit a similar analysis for these complement clauses. A verb which uses
-gat must have an object and in these cases the complement clause is the object.","[193, 194]"
"   Payne ( 1 98Sb: 1 99) points out that subjects are usually context-bound and that contextually
bound elements are removed from the scope of negation. What is actually negated is the
contextually free part of the sentence. This, he says, """".often gives the i mpression that
sentential negation might better be described as 'VP negation ""'. Indeed, this is clearly the
case for Abun because the syntax makes that evident by the way the two particles bracket the
predicate (that is, the VP).
    Therefore when both particles are used, the scope of negation excludes the subject. When
we consider a situation where someone is discussing a hunting trip, one might say, 'Isak
killed a pig near the Nai river' . In order to negate this sentence, one would say, 'Isak did not
kill a pig near the Nai river' , as in example 8.33. In this example, the subject, Isak, is not
within the scope of negation because it is contextually bound; that is, Isak ' s actions were
under discussion. It is the relationship between Isak and the ki lling of a pig near the Nai river
that falls within the scope of the negation . The scope of negation when both particles are used
is the predicate, as is evidenced by the position of the two negative particles.
   So it is either the action (killing), the object (the wild pig) or the location (by the Nai river)
that could be negated. All three of these fall within the scope of negation. The subject, Isak,
does not. Which constituent is actually being negated in the mind of the speaker would in
most cases be clear from the context.
   The shifting of words and phrases from outside to inside the bracketing of the linked pair
of negative particles illustrates that the two particles do in fact determine the scope of
negation. In example 8 .34, if kamdik-kamdik 'every day' is included within the bracket it is
also included within the scope of negation. If it is inside the bracket as in 8 . 34c, then the
frequency of eating fish is also negated. Therefore the meaning changes to ' I do not eat fish
every day' or 'Not every day I eat fish ' , implying that on some days fish is eaten, but not
every day. Example 8.34b has 'every day' outside of the bracket formed by the linked pair of
particles. In this way the action of eating, and the object, fish, are within the scope of
negation, but not the frequency. The temporal word in this case is outside of the scope
negation. In this way the two negative particles delineate the scope of negation, in the sense
that whatever falls between them falls within the scope of negation.

10.2. 1 . 1 UTIERANCE PREDICATES
   In Abun, predicates which express some type of verbal utterance or communication use
the complementiser do. This is the most common form of complement. The following
examples show predicates representing different types of communication.
   1 0. 1   Ii ki do         ""sane-yo       men mu sino "".
            l sG say COM so-when.lRR 1 PL          go all

            He shouted, ""Yorfen, please help me !""
   I n Abun the difference between direct and indirect quotation is not marked in the syntax.
This difference is not achieved by a pause or absence of a complementiser, but rather a
difference in the personal pronouns used. Example 1 0.7 below shows an indirect quotation.
1 66                                                                                    CHAPTER 10The pronouns used in this example appear unusual from an English speaker' s perspective, in
that within the quotation the addressee is referred to as a 'you ' , but the speaker is referred to
as an 'he ' .
   1 0 .7    An     tom     ji  do  ""a           mu    nde yo            a
             3SG    arrange lSG COM 2sG          go    NEG then.IRR      2SG
             kem wade ber noru re             an ma        watbot or              et "" .
             stay until later night this 3SG come examine thorough SUBJ
             He arranged with me that, ""Don' t go, you stay until later tonight and he would
             come and examine (you) thoroughly"".
   The use of pronouns in this way indicates that this is an indirect quotation because the
speaker is referred to in the third person. This 'unusual' mix of pronouns is common in
Abun reported speech. Example 10.8 below is also an indirect quote. Again the only means
of identifying it as such is by the pronouns used and not by some other syntactic device.
   10.8      Yen    kendo men do         men gwat men bi          suk   e           men grem.
             people call     1 PL COM IPL bring 1 PL poss things and                1 PL put
             They called us to bring our things and leave (them there).
  The pronouns of example 10.8 are in the first person rather than in the second person,
which would be the normal situation if this were a direct quote of a request or command.
   Predicates which express force or manipulation, if they are verbal in nature, take do in the
same way as other utterance predicates. So the verbs syaugat 'command' and the weaker
syogat 'order/tell ' behave as other utterance predicates when taking a complement.
   10.9      An     syaugat men-ka-we do men-ka-we k i suk-du
             3SG    command 1 PL-CL-two COM 1 PL-CL-two say NOM-Speak

              He commanded the two of us not to tell this story again.

              He ordered the man who was not a shaman , ""If you are going now, it is of first
              importance that you take an axe"".","[177, 178]"

5.2. 1 NOUN PHRASE MOOIFlERS
   All modifiers in noun phrases are posthead. They occur after the head and before any
determiner which may appear. Such modifiers may consist of members from each of the
following classes of words or phrases :
other nouns
              adjectival phrase, consisting of adjectives such as colour (black, white), size (big,
              small) or quality (hard, soft), followed by an optional intensifier
              quantifier phrase, optionally preceded by a classifier, with quantifiers:
                      general (many, few, some)
                      cardinal numerals (one, two . . . )
                      ordinal numerals (first, second)
PHRASE STRUCIVRE                                                                             69   These modifiers appear in the noun phrase in the following order:                   (OTHER NOUN) (ADJECTIVAL PHRASE) (QUANTIFIER PHRASE)
   For example:
   5.16      nok         ku            sye      teke r koi   bok       yo
             wild.pig flesh       big    !NT     CL          several   DET
             Head       Noun Adj Phrase Class                Quant     Det
             several very big pieces of wild pig meat
   A noun phrase of the type gi ven in the example above, although acceptable to an Abun
speaker, is rather ' heavy' . By that we mean normally they would not include as many
modifiers together in this way. In order to retain the modification in a more natural style,
various strategies are employed to limit the number of modifiers in any one noun phrase.
These are discussed later in this section .
   Each modifier type will now be discussed with further examples.
   Other nouns may modify the head of a noun phrase. Thjs type of construction is usually
referred to as a complex noun phrase, but since the addition of another noun following the
head modifies the head analogous to other modifiers, we have chosen to discuss it as a
modifier. Examples of this type are:
   5.17      nggwe     jamsem           ne
             garden cassava             DET
             the cassava garden
   5.18      mbre             toha       sak     gri
             eastern.cloth toba CL               three
             three lengths of toba cloth
   The use of adjectival phrases as modifiers of the heads of noun phrases is by far the
most common type of modification. In most cases an adjectival phrase is realised by a single
adjective only, such as colour as in example 5 . 19, size 5.20, and quality 5 .2 1 . This type of
modification follows any other nouns that modify the head of the noun phrase. For more
complex examples of adjectival phrases see §5.5.
   5.19      Ye        gu     minda           kri.
             people    kill butterfly yellow
             They killed yellow butterflies.
  5 .20      os     nggwot        ne
             path narrow     DET
             the narrow path
  5.21       os    wit      yo
             way bad        DET
             a bad way
  Quantifier phrases may have either a general quantifier, an ordinal numeral or a cardinal
numeral as its head, and is preceded by an optional classifier when the head is a general
quantifier or an ordinal numeral, and an obligatory classifier when the head is a cardinal
numeral. See §5.6 for a discussion of quantifier phrases. Some examples are:
70                                                                                 CHAPTER 5     5 .22      Nggon (ge) m wa rna.
                woman CL   many come
                Many women came.
     5.23       An      bi      nu          (ke) do-gri.
                3SG     poss  house CL             the.one.which-three
                His house is the third one.
     5.24       Ji ku          ndar       sye ge at.
                1 sG meet    dog    big       CL four
                I found four big dogs.
   There are limitations concerning modifiers within an Abun noun phrase. There are, of
course, semantic restrictions as to which modifiers may co-occur with others, and moreover,
there is pressure to limit the number of modifiers, so that the maximum noun phrase will
normally include only one of each type of modifier. Thus a noun phrase with two adjectives
is unacceptable. If a speaker desires to say something like 'two big white dogs ' , which
involves two adjectives, it is unacceptable to the Abun speaker to use the expression found in
example 5.25; rather, relativisation is usually employed, as in 5.26a, and 5 .26b.
     5.25        *ndar kwo       sye       ge    we
                dog     white big          CL    two
                two big white dogs
     5 .26 a.   ndar kwo        ge w e          gato   sye
                dog white CL two REL                   big
                1 . two white dogs that are big
                2. two big white dogs
             b. ndar sye ge           w e gato          kwo
                dog big body two REL                    white
                1 . two big dogs that are white
                2. two big white dogs
   One may posit that the relative clause modifies the noun phrase as a whole since it follows
the determiner, as seen in example 5.27 below. (See further discussion in §5.2.3.)
     5 .27      suk     wakgan       yo     gata men mbrinket
                thing small       DET REL 1 PL forget
                1 . some small things that we forgot
                2. some small forgotten things
   Alternatively, the speaker may frequently also juxtapose one of the adjectives in the form
of an appositional verbless clause, as seen in example 5.28. This type of modification is more
typical when the noun phrase fi lls the object position. In this case the modification is
syntactically outside the noun phrase; it is like a parenthetical comment.
     5.28       ndar kwo        ge         we,    ndar ne       sye

   There are five distinct types of detenniners used in Abun noun phrases. The first type is
the unspecific/specific distinction. The others are: deictics, anaphoric referents (which refer to
a previously mentioned person/thing), external referents (which refer to the proximity of an
item in relation to the speaker), and reflexives. Both anaphoric and external referents may
compound with deictics. These particles occur in phrase-final position. Table 5.3 lists each
type and the relevant particles, each of which will be discussed in tum below.","[80, 81, 82, 83]"
"
10.4.2 UTIERANCE PREDICATES
  There is only one utterance predicate, kendo 'call' which exhjbits these two structural
possibilities. Example 10.77 below earlier appeared as example 10.8.
   1 0.77     Yen        kendo men do       men gwat men b i           suk      e   men grem.

             3sG   call   Erensi come too

  Another predicate that i s similar is the pretence predicate kidar 'lie/trick/deceive ' .
Example 1 0.79 appeared earlier as example 10. 19.
     1 0.79     An     kidar nje         do        an     yewon.
                3sG lie       people COM 3SG shaman
                He lied to people that he was a shaman.
     1 0 . 80   Erensi kidar        pa        ne        mu.
                Erensi deceive child DEf go
                Erensi deceived the child into going (away).
     It appears that only a small number of predicates may behave this way, exhibiting two
distinct structural possibilities. As the above examples illustrate, there appear to be certain
restrictions which limit the number of predicates capable of doing this. One restriction limits
predicates to those that are transitive. Any intransitive verb can occur only with the
complementiser present. The second restriction appears to be one of co-referentiality. Givan
( 1 993: 1 5) describes the sharing of referents across contiguous clauses and tenns this
'referential continuity' . In describing co-reference limitations for English complement
clauses he notes ( 1 993 : 1 6) that ""The subject of the complement of a modality verb must be
co-referential with the subject of the main verb and the subject of the complement of a
manipulative verb must be co-referential with the object of the main verb"" [italics his]. In
Abun, co-reference restrictions also apply but are somewhat different to those which Givan
has described for English. In Abun, if these predicates can take both an object and
complement constituent then there needs to be agreement between the object and the
complement constituent. In three of the above examples, 1 0.73, 1 0.75 and 1 0.77, the object
of the predicate is co-referential with the subject of the complement clause. In all of these
cases the subject of the complement clause is replaced by a pronoun which agrees in number
and person with the object of the matrix clause. However, example 1 0.79 shows a pretence
predicate which varies in that the subject of the complement clause agrees with the subject of
the main clause predicate. Here again a pronoun is used to indicate agreement. The means of
pronominal reference to the subject of the complement clause is typical of all cases where
these two constituents are co-referential. Unlike English, where only in manipulative
predicates does the object of the predicate agree with the subject of the complement, as
shown in Table 10. 1 , this restriction is shared by other predicate types. 29 Therefore it appears
that if a particular predicate can take complements both with and without a complementiser
then co-reference restrictions operate.","[199, 200]"
"
4.5.4 MOOD
    According to Lyons ( 1 968:307) the term mood ""is best defined in relation to an
' unmarked' class of sentences which express simple statements of fact, unqualified with
respect to the attitude of the speaker towards what he is saying"".
   In Abun the indicative mood is unmarked while the other two basic types of mood are
marked by the use of particles which occur clause-final. In addition Abun also marks another
mood, that of frustrated action. A list of all Abun mood particles is given in Table 3 . 1 6 in
§3.4.5.
   Interrogative mood, in addition to the question word itself, has two particles that bracket
the clause, te 'INITIAL QUESTION MARKER' , for all types of questions and a final question marker
which is one of:
           ne               INFORMATION FINAL QUESTION MARKER (example 4.42)
           e                YES/NO FINAL QUESTION MARKER (example 4.43)

'PROHlBITIVE' 4.49. The unmarked form, 'BASIC IMPERATIVE' 4.50, is distinguished from

   Frustrated action mood uses the particle ware, as in example 4.5 1 . The nearest English
equivalent would be 'in vain' , 'to no avail' or 'but without success ' . Its meaning is that an
action was attempted but the goal of the action was not achieved. It is clause-final like other
moods following modal markers. See §6.3 for more details.

8.2.5 NEGATION IN COMPLEX SENTENCES
  Complex sentences, where a clause is embedded within a main clause, are negated in
Abun in the same way as simple sentences. The pattern is:                                            S yo PRED nde,
where clauses may be embedded in the object position, such as in example 8.23. The word
order remains rigid in these constructions, with the whole of the predicate including the
embedded clause bracketed by the particles.
   8 . 23 a.   Ii     me   Isak      ben    suk     mo       nggwe.
               l SG   see Isak    do     things LOC          garden
               I saw Isak working in the garden.
          b. Ii       yo      me Isak ben suk                 mo      nggwe    nde.
               l SG   NEG      see Isak    do     things      LOC     garden   NEG
               I did not see Isak working in the garden.",[150]

10.3. 1 MEANs OF IDENTIFYING TIlE COMPLEMENT CLAUSE IN ABUN
   Since this particular clause type contains no complementiser, what is the basis for
assuming that these are complement clauses? These clauses are without any type of marking
and lack some means of syntactic identification which could identify them as complements.
There is a type of complement termed 'paratactic' which does not use a complementiser.
These clauses are not subordinate but rather are considered as independent clauses capable of
standing on their own.24 All of the constituents which follow the predicates in examples
10.55 to 10.53 above have the structure of a simple Abun clause. For instance an jam mo j i
'she listens to (or obeys) me' from 1 0.50 and ye mwa maskwa yu 'many people were angry
with each other' from 1 0.52 are all good Abun clauses. It could be possible then to consider
these clauses as paratactic complements since they are capable of standing on their own as
independent clauses. Given that the complex sentences that contain these clauses are
unmarked to indicate embedding or subordination, what means can be used to identify them
as subordinate complement clauses, embedded within the larger sentence?
    Giv6n has listed several means by which complement clauses can be syntactically
encoded ( 1 990:538ff). These various means show some type of syntactic variation by which
it can be determined that the clause functions as an argument of a predicate. One such type of
syntactic evidence he terms 'predicate raising' which results in forms like 'let go' or 'make
eat' . Abun does not appear to have any of these forms. Another means is through case
marking of the subject of the complement verb. Since Abun is a language which lacks any
form of case marking, this is not a means through which a complement clause could be
marked. Another means again is that of a subordinating morpheme or complementiser.
Complement clause types with such a marker have been described earlier (in § 1O.2 above).
He lists one other means of encoding a clause as a complement clause, that of verb
morphology or finiteness. In these cases, the complement clause is usually reduced with the
verb not taking a subject and the verb morphology being distinct from that found in
24    See Noonan ( 1 985:59-60) for a discussion on this.
COMPLEMENT ClAUSES                                                                           1 79indicative clauses. Can this means of encoding a complement be used for Abun?              Does
Abun have an infinitive form of the verb?","[190, 191]"

8.S 1HE SCOPEOF NEGATION
   Klima ( 1 964), Reesink ( 1986) and Payne ( 1 98Sb) discuss the scope of negation in terms
of 'constituent' and 'sentential ' . The negation of words or phrases may be called 'constituent
negation' , while the negation of predicates, sentences and more complex sentences has
traditionally been called 'sentential negation ' . These two terms were coined initially in relation
to English. In the sentence, 'John is unhappy' , the negation is defined as 'constituent'
because the negation operates on one part (or constituent) of the sentence; while in 'John is
not happy' , the type of negation is defined as 'sentential ' .
   I n Abun the scope o f negation i s usually sentential (or, more precisely, the negation o f the
predicate) and this is syntactically marked by use of the linked pair of negative particles
(§8.S . I ). Take, for example, the sentence in example 8.33, a simple negative indicative
sentence where the two negative particles surround the predicate. In this case, the action
(killing), the object (the wild pig) or the location (by the Nai river) all fall within the scope of
negation. The subject (Isak), however, does not fall within the scope of negation here because
subjects are usually contextually bound.
142                                                                                      CHAPTER 8   8.33      Isak yo       gu     nok         mo   syur    Nai de         nde.
             Isak NEG      kill wild. pig LOC water Nai           bank    NEG
              Isak did not kill a wild pig by the Nai river.
   As to which constituent is actually being negated in the mind of the speaker would in most
cases be clear from the context, but there are syntactic strategies by which the scope of
negation can be narrowed to focus on one constituent. This is discussed in § 8 .S.2.","[153, 154]"
"
4.4. 1 ADVERBIAL PHRASE')
   Adverbial phrases consist of an adverb and an optional intensifier. In most cases such
phrases are realised by an adverb alone.
   There are several types of adverbs discussed in §3.3.4 such as time adverbs, manner
adverbs, directional adverbs and degree adverbs. Degree adverbs are used in forming
adverbial and adjectival phrases and will be discussed later in §5.5. The other three types
occur as free forms or as the head of an adverbial phrase. There is some flexibility in their
placement in the Abun sentence, but as a general rule time adverbs are sentence-initial while
manner and directional adverbs generall y fol low the object and precede prepositional phrases.
    The most flexible as to their placement in an Abun sentence are time adverbs. An example
below repeated from §3.3.4 (examples 3 .46a, b, c, d) i l lustrates this. Usuall y time adverbs
are sentence-initial, but to change the focus and semantic scope of the predicate they may
fol low the verb. This i s particularly significant in negative indicative sentences which are
discussed in §8.5. Also time adverbs can occur between a subject and verb on rare occasions,
as in example 4. 1 4b, breaking the normal pattern of Abun main clauses.
   4 . 1 4 a. Kam-dik-kam-dik   an        rna  rno ji    hi              nu.

            Everyday he came to my house.
         c. An      rna     kam-dik-kam-dik          rna  ji     hi      nu.
            3SG     come    day-one-day-one          LOC   ISG poss      house
            SUBJECT VERB    ADVERB                   LOCATIVE PHRASE
            He came everyday to my house.

            3SG     come LOC I SG poss            house day-one-day-one
            SUBJECT VERB LCX:ATIVE PHRASE                  AD\IffiB
            He came to my house everyday.
    In Abun adverbs of manner there is some flexibility, but they generally follow the object,
where present. Therefore in intransitive clauses these adverbs directly follow the verb, as in
example 4. 1 5a, or another adjunct, 4. 1 5b; but they are unacceptable preverbally, 4. 1 5c, or
fol lowing any polarity, aspect, modality or mood particle.

    Usually an adverb indicating the manner of the action not only foI Iows the object but also
precedes the dative, as seen in example 4. 1 6a. It may also fol low any adjunct including the
dative as in 4. 1 6b, but it may not occur in any position ahead of the object, as in 4. 1 6c to
4. 1 6e.

   Adverbs indicating direction also occur in the same position, that is, fol lowing the object
and preceding any prepositional phrase, as in example 4. 1 7 . These adverbs are free-form
relator nouns (see §3.3.2) such as ti 'sea, north ' , bur 'earth, down ' , nirn 'above, east' , k e t
'west ' , and nden 'interior, south ' .

4.7.2 TOPICALISATION
   Foley and Van Valin ( 1 985:355) define topicalisation as a procedure used to place an NP,
other than a subject, sentence-initially. In contrast to passive structures which are clause­
internal, Foley and Van Valin consider topicalisation as clause-external. They say,
''Topicalisation .. .involve(s) the occurrence of an external topic NP fol lowed by a sentence
which relates to it in some way"".
   In Abun, simple prepositioning is used to foreground objects and mo locative phrases
with no pronoun trace left in the sentence. The foregrounded item becomes the topic upon
which a comment follows. For example:
     4.57    Yu     ne     ye     gwat mu mo nden.
             bag AN<\. 3INDEF take        go to        bush
             1 . The bag, someone took (it) to the bush.
             2. The bag was taken to the bush.
     4.58    Mo nden ne men git              boge.
             LOC bush AN<\. I PL eat         fish
             In the bush we ate fish.
   Foley and Van Valin ( 1 985 : 356) claim that "" ... the primary functions of these [topicalised]
constructions are to introduce new referents into a discourse, or to reintroduce a referent
which was previously introduced but which has not been mentioned in the immediately
preceding discourse"".
   The function of topicalisation in Abun is the second of those mentioned above, namely to
reintroduce a previously introduced referent. However, the referent may have been mentioned
in the immediately preceding sentence, such as in example 4.59.
     4.59    An     mu     me    su-git     yak   mo      nden.
             3SG    go     see   NOM-eat    j ump LOC     outside
             Su-git     jon      ne     men grem kop          mo dapur.
             NOM-eat     cooked AN<\. I PL      put    aside LOC kitchen
             He went quickly outside to see the food. The cooked food, we had put aside in
             the kitchen.
CLAUSE STRUCTURE                                                                              63   In Abun, topicalisation does not occur in isolation. The object or location must have been
mentioned in previous discussion. For this reason, in all cases of topicaJisation in Abun, the
determiner, or more specifically the anaphoric referent ne, is obligatory. In example 4.59
'food' was already mentioned in the sentence previous to the one where it is topicaJised.
   Foley and Van Valin ( 1 985:30 1 ) also make the point that in most languages passive is
restricted to core constituents while topicalisation is not. In Abun, de-focusing constructions
are limited to the core, whereas topicalisation is also possible with peripheral constituents, but
only with mo locative phrases, as seen in example 4.60. Topicalisation of other phrase types
such as benefactive (4.6 1 ) or instrumental (4.62) is unacceptable to an Abun speaker.
   4.60       Mo kampung mit               ne     an gu      ye     or              reo
