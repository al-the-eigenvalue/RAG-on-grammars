"4.2.4     Some marked word order/intonation patterns
4.2.4.1    Introduction
In this section I exemplify some marked word order constructions in which the
ordering of subjects, objects, and obliques differs from the typical order shown in
Figure 4.2 (§4.2.2.3) in a systematically meaningful way. Marked constructions
typically involve movement of a phrase that is prominent in some way to the front
or back of the clause, where it may be prosodically marked as separate from the
remaining clausal constituents.
   I define three features of these marked constructions: movement, copying, and
broken intonation. In some situations the features are codependent.22
    Movement refers to the placing of an NP, PP or PlcP at either the left or right
edge of the clause, contrary to typical word order preference as described in Figure
4.2. Copying refers to the coreference of an initial or final constituent by a pro-
nominal element within the clause. Broken intonation refers to distinct prosodic
treatment of the first referring expression of the unit, or of a post-verbal referring
expression. In the first case, the initial phrase is pronounced with rising intona-
tion followed by a pause (‘comma intonation’), and there is thus an intonation unit
boundary between it and the clausal constituents that follow it. In the second case,
the right-moved phrase follows a predicate that is pronounced with closing intona-
tion (distinguishing it from a clefted constituent).
   I refer to left movement in Duna text that does not also involve copying or
broken intonation as fronting. Fronting is primarily associated with the pragmatic
property focus, and is only relevant to non-subject arguments, as subjects typically
precede other constituents in unmarked order.23
  22
      For example, an object argument that is copied must also be moved (unless movement is a null
feature, for example, if the subject argument of the clause is elided rather than overt).
   23
      The fact that subject NPs generally occur clause initially suggests a default treatment of the
subject as a prominent participant.

    I refer to copying and/or broken intonation of a leftmost NP, PlcP or PP as left
dislocation.24 Left dislocation is primarily associated with the pragmatic property
‘link’ (Vallduvı́ 1992) and the ‘re-activation’ of topical participants in discourse
(Lambrecht 1994; Foley 2007).
    I refer to any right edge placement of a constituent that coincides with broken
intonation as right dislocation.25 Right dislocation is associated with clarification
and ‘tidying’ a clause that the speaker judges as confused or ambiguous.","[149, 150]"
"4.2.2     Overview of typical word order
4.2.2.1    Subject and object NPs
In typical word order, subject argument NPs are clause-initial. Object NPs typically
follow subject NPs. R object NPs typically precede T object NPs. This ordering is
represented in Figure 4.1.
          ——————————————————————————–
                           (                           )

4.2.2.2    Obliques
In monovalent clauses, obliques typically follow a subject argument NP if one is
present, as in (64). (64)     inu   ho-nga     ra-o-na.
          1/2PL here-EXCV be/sit-PFV-SPEC
          Subj Oblique V
          ‘We sat here.’ (T/MK:141103)    In bivalent or trivalent clauses, the position of an oblique NP, PlcP or PP gener-
ally reflects the nature of its semantic role. Andrews (2007) distinguishes between
semantic roles that are ‘participatory’, being “borne by what one would think of as
actual participants in the situation implied by the verb” and ‘circumstantial’, being
“borne by entities that do not really participate, but instead form part of the setting
of the event” (2007:140). I follow this terminology in making a distinction between
participatory and circumstantial obliques, as this is indicative of word order pref-
erence. Participatory obliques typically follow an object NP (if present) whereas
circumstantial obliques typically precede an object NP. This is not a strictly main-
tained order, but is usual in the textual data.
    Postpositional phrases marked with -ka ‘INSTR’ (§6.5.2) have the semantic role
of instrument, a typical participatory semantic role (Andrews 2007:140). Instrument
obliques typically follow an object NP, as in (65) and (66).

         ‘Now [people] wash the children with the soap...’ (T/KP:261103ii)    NPs that are marked with -ta ‘LOC’ (§6.3.4.2) can be either participatory or
circumstantial. In (67), the LOC-marked NP is participatory as it is the R argument
of the serialised trivalent predicate (§7.3), and follows the object NP. In (68), the
oblique is circumstantial, and precedes the object NP. (67) ...stori paluni mbatia inu-ta              ruwa ngu.

         ‘Haya and I dug up sweet potato at the garden...’ (T/MM:250903)    Nominal phrases that are marked with the inner/concealing location marker -ra
‘CNCL’ (§6.3.4.3) are typically participatory obliques, as in (69). The role of the
netbag (nu) in this example can be interpreted as an inner locative describing the
location of a participant (Andrews 1985:70) and/or the container/instrument role
that is expected from the predicate yakuwa- ‘carry (within)’. (69) ayu khunu hina              nu-ra           yaki-ya.

         ‘Now they carry sweet potato in netbags.’ (T/HS:061103i)    Place phrases (§6.4) denote locations, and these can be either participatory or
circumstantial. A participatory location is ‘expected’ from the predicate of the
clause in which it occurs, whereas a circumstantial location is not. For example,
the (derived) bivalent relocation verb roae- ‘place something’ that heads the clause
shown in (70) anticipates a location-like participant.12 The PlcP that refers to this
participant, horaka, follows the object NP. In (71), horaka is not expected from the
predicate and describes the ‘setting’ of the activity. This is a circumstantial oblique,
and precedes the object NP.
  12
    I see this participant as distinct from an argument, as it cannot alternatively be realised in the
clause as an unmarked NP or through zero anaphora.

            ‘They killed pigs there...’ (T/YS:270205)    Temporal expressions (§3.8) quite commonly follow a subject NP and precede
an object NP; see for example (319), (332). These describe the time setting of an
activity, that is, are typically circumstantial.","[136, 137, 138]"
"4.2.2.3       Summary
The typical ordering of subject and object NPs and obliques in the clause is sum-
marised in Figure 4.2. Oblique constituents are identified as ‘participatory’ or ‘cir-
cumstantial’. If more than one object NP is present, R argument objects typically
precede T argument objects. The predicate is the only obligatory constituent.

"4.2.4.4    Right dislocation
In what I term right dislocation in Duna a participant is referenced or reiterated
following the predicate. The final verb of the clause has closing intonation, and the
final NP is tacked on as an afterthought. Right dislocation is used in clarification,
for example to repair a sentence that contains hesitations, truncations, repetitions
and/or referential ambiguity (106 and 107), or to expand on something the speaker
feels they have described erroneously or imprecisely (108).(106)     ho-ra-ka        khena ra.. anda ngi-ya. ingini ndu su.

Chapter 5Constituents of nominal phrases
5.1     Introduction
This chapter outlines the structure of nominal phrases (NPs) and describes in more
detail the words that can occur as part of them, including common nouns, adjectives,
quantifiers, demonstratives, proper names, personal pronouns, and interrogatives.
The chapter examines properties that are relevant at the word level (for example,
the morphological structure of nouns), and those that apply at the phrase level (for
example, what words do and do not typically co-occur within an NP), as well as out-
lining some features of NPs that have to do with the clause as a whole (for example,
reference properties of personal pronouns with regard to grammatical relation). It is
mainly concerned with free and phrasal rather than bound constituents of referring
expressions, the latter being described in the following chapter.
    Nominal phrases are (potentially) referring expressions that describe entities,
typically those that are participants required by the predicate that heads the clause
in which they occur. A nominal phrase functions as one constituent within the larger
structure of the clause. It may consist of a single word, or a sequence of words that
follow a fixed templatic order. Morphological operations that relate to features such
as specificity or semantic role are applied once to this constituent as a whole.
    The clause shown in (109) contains one nominal phrase, describing the single
participant (the subject) required by the monovalent verbal predicate he- ‘cry’. This
NP includes a common noun ima ‘woman’, an intensified adjective khera kone ‘very
old’ that describes a further property of the woman, and the quantifier ndu which
indicates both singularity and indefiniteness.(109)   [ima   khera kone    ndu] he-ya...
        woman old     INTENS one   cry-DEP
              NP                   Predicate
        ‘A very old woman was crying...’ (T/YS:KGV7.22)   A common noun such as ima in (109) is the notional head of the NP, in the sense                                        127
128                                          Chapter 5. Constituents of nominal phrases
that it “refers to the same entity that the whole phrase refers to” (Payne 1997:73).1
A nominal phrase that is notionally headed by a common noun (a ‘common noun
NP’) can consist of a common noun (N), one or more Adjectives (A), a quantifier
(Q) and a Demonstrative (Dem), which occur in fixed order, as shown in Figure
5.1. In nominal phrases that include a spatial demonstrative, an NP marker (§6.3)
is obligatory. Note that adjectives, quantifiers, and demonstratives can function
pronominally as well as adnominally, as the notional head does not need to be overt
in the phrase as a common noun if its identity is recoverable from context, for
example if it is referenced in the preceding clause or sentence or is a salient item in
the current speech setting.

                       Figure 5.1 Ordering of words in a nominal phrase
    Common noun NPs can also include a phrase-initial constituent that denotes a
possessor. This possessor can be expressed as an unmarked NP or a postpositional
phrase (formed with the NP postposition -ya ‘BEN’, §6.5.4). I notate this phrasal
constituent as ‘XPposs ’. Nominal phrases that exemplify the different possiblities of
the template shown in Figure 5.1 are presented and discussed in §5.2.
    The clause shown in (110) contains two NPs, describing the two participants
required by the bivalent verbal predicate, sa- ‘strike’. The first NP consists of a
(CS-marked) proper name (PN), Polo-ka, the subject argument. This is a ‘Proper
name NP’ (NPP N ), further discussed in §5.3.2. The second nominal phrase consists
of a personal pronoun (PPro) no ‘1SG’. This is a ‘Personal pronoun NP’ (NPP P ro ),
discussed in §5.3.1.","[154, 155, 156, 157]"
"5.4.2.3    Double personal pronouns
Examples (254) to (257) show clauses in in which one participant is referenced by
two adjacent personal pronouns. Doubling a pronoun emphasises the nature of the
referent as distinct and solitary. (I include an approximation of this emphasis in
parentheses in the translation lines.) There is no intonational evidence that the pro-
nouns are separate phrases. Example (258) shows a doubled inclusory pronominal
(§5.4.2.2).

ent adjacent pronouns, the second being marked with the exclusive morpheme -nga
(§6.6.2). In this case, one could argue that each pronoun is a separate NP, one
being the subject argument and one being the object argument. However, this inter-
pretation runs counter to the fact that the exclusive marker -nga can only sensibly
occur on the second pronoun in a double pronoun sequence, not the first pronoun, as
shown in (259b). This suggests that -nga is being applied to a single NP constituent
that is composed of two pronouns.(259)   a. no no-nga            so.

the identical adjacent pronouns represent two distinct argument NPs. However I
find it most sensible and consistent to interpret khunu khunu as a single subject NP.
5.4. Participant reference with multiple NPs                                        165
The double pronoun construction emphatically identifies the participants as a dis-
tinct group, and contrasted subject marking with -ka (§6.6.1) further highlights the
fact that it is this group only who engaged in this activity. The fact that the contras-
ted subject marker occurs on the second rather than the first pronoun (that is, the
opposite of what would be expected from typical word order if these pronouns were
separate subject and object NPs) supports a ‘single NP constituent’ interpretation.(260)     khunu khunu-ka hara-tia.

other nominal phrase that reiterates or further details the identity of the referent.

Chapter 6NP, PP, and PlcP morphology
6.1     Introduction
This chapter describes bound forms that occur at the right edge of a referring expres-
sion; constituents of a phrase that are dependent markers rather than free lexemes.1
    The bound forms presented in §6.2 - §6.5 are grouped according to a combina-
tion of semantic, distributional, and functional properties into four types: epistemic
demonstratives, NP markers, PlcP markers, and postpositions. The general order
of application of these markers is shown in Figure 6.1, with ‘L’ standing for ‘last
potentially free-standing lexeme of the phrase’ (a nominal, adjective, quantifier,
demonstrative, or interrogative root).2

                     Figure 6.1 Order of co-occurring phrase-final morphemes
    Epistemic markers can be included in a phrase to indicate features concern-
ing speaker and hearer knowledge of the referent (§6.2). These markers occupy a
roughly equivalent position in the referring expression to a demonstrative (§5.2.4),
and can (and in some cases must) be followed by an NP or PlcP marker. These
forms also occur mark epistemic assessment on final predicates, where they take
scope over a proposition rather than an entity.

      Note that, although all of the bound morphemes described in this chapter are postpositional in
that they are placed after the lexical constituents of a phrase, I reserve the label ‘postposition’ (P) for
the forms described in §6.5 only.
    2
      This representation does not provide a minimal or exhaustive template, and does not address
the complex co-occurrence restrictions and dependency relationships that exist between individual
forms. Rather, it is intended to indicate that if more than one type of marker is present in a single
referring expression, this is the way they will be arranged.","[192, 193, 194, 195]"

Abstract
This thesis is an introduction to Duna, a language spoken by approximately 25,000
people living in Southern Highlands Province in Papua New Guinea. Duna (also
known as Yuna) is classified as a member of the Duna-Bogaya subgroup of the Trans
New Guinea family. This study is primarily based on work with Duna speakers of
the Lake Kopiago region.
     The thesis provides a basic treatment of phonology, describes the structure of
simple sentences, and examines in detail the expression of epistemic assessment
(the treatment of a proposition as representing knowledge), a semantic domain that
is richly encoded by bound morphemes in the language.
     Chapter 1 gives background information concerning the Duna lands, people,
and language situation. It also describes previous work that has been done on the
language, and the nature and sources of the data used in this study.
     Chapter 2 includes an overview of Duna segmental phonology and gives an
account of citation tone contrasts in monomorphemic words.
     Chapter 3 outlines Duna word classes, including large open lexical classes such
as nouns, and smaller closed grammatical classes such as demonstratives.
     Chapter 4 deals with the structure of the basic clause, describing the different
clause types and outlining dominant and pragmatically marked word orders.
     Nouns and NP structure are treated in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 details NP marking
that encodes epistemic positioning, specificity, pairhood, grouphood, semantic role,
grammatical relation, and discourse or pragmatic prominence.
     Chapter 7 analyses complex predicates, for example, those that are composed
of a verb and a verb adjunct, or of several verbs in series.
     The remainder of the thesis focusses on bound morphemes that are added to
the predicate of a final clause. Chapter 8 treats markers which specify features
of the denoted situation in terms of time or event modality. Chapters 9 and 10
describe evidential markers, information status markers, and epistemic particles,
morphemes which attach to a final predicate to express an epistemic assessment of
the proposition.
     Chapter 11 describes the formal and functional features of Duna sentence types
and discusses typical implications that certain predicate markers have concerning a
speaker’s or addressee’s relationship to the denoted situation.

Acknowledgements
Many Duna people in the Lake Kopiago area and in Mount Hagen (Western High-
lands Province) have contributed language material and discussion to this work. I
thank them wholeheartedly for their essential part in this study, as well as their ex-
cellent company. Kenny Kendoli, Petros Kilapa, Kipu Piero and Richard Alo in
particular translated and discussed their language with humour, patience, tenacity,
thoughtfulness, and insight. Richard, you were taken from us too soon, and I con-
tinue to honour your great courage, intelligence, and compassion.
    Whilst at Lake Kopiago I was very lucky to be able to record texts from the late
Sane Noma and Raki Patako, and from Pastor Hagini Yami, three senior Duna men
of extraordinary wisdom and spirit. Special thanks also to Kipu, Metai Heri, Haya
Suku, Monica Kenny and Metina Kali for the hard work they put into conversing
with a learner of their language.
    In the field I was based at an ANU research house in Rewapi (Hirane parish),
next door to Kenny and Kipu and their family members. Many thanks to them
for putting up with the extra disruption and responsibilities that this entailed, and
to other members of the Rewapi/Hirane and wider Lake Kopiago community who
were so welcoming and kind. I hope to find some way to repay you.
    In writing this thesis I have been privileged to be under the tutelage of my su-
pervisors Andrew Pawley and Alan Rumsey of the Research School of Pacific and
Asian Studies. Andy whipped the bulk of my early chapter drafts into shape, and de-
voted much time and effort to his careful reading of a near-final draft of the thesis.
His stringent and perspicuous advice has been of immense value to me at every
stage of the writing process. Alan Rumsey has conscientiously read even my most
off-the-rail writings, and consistently offered wise and sensitive feedback. He has
helped me to battle with some difficult organisational problems, and been encour-
aging and engaged throughout.
    My advisor Malcolm Ross contributed significantly to a reworking of Chapters
1-7 with his thoughtful, precise, and clear-sighted comments. Nicholas Evans got
stuck into Chapters 8-11 with enthusiasm and incisiveness. I enjoyed our discus-
sions and arguments very much, and they were very important in helping me revise
the thesis.
    I began my studies at the ANU in 2003 as a member of an interdisciplinary
project ‘Chanted Tales from Highland New Guinea’ (funded by the Australian Re-
search Council), of which Alan Rumsey was the lead Chief Investigator. Being
a member of this project provided me with some additional funds for fieldwork
and translation, and gave me the opportunity to take part in some very stimulat-
ing workshops and collaborations. Thanks to Alan and also to Don Niles (Partner                                         iii

Investigator on the project) for all their hard work in this regard.
    The anthropologist Nicole Haley has been working with Duna people since
1994, and was a postdoctoral fellow on the Chanted Tales project. She was in-
strumental in making this language study happen, and I have benefited greatly from
her experience and hard work. Nicole organised the establishment of the ANU re-
search base at Rewapi, introduced me to the people who were pivotal to my study
of Duna, and facilitated Kenny Kendoli and Richard Alo’s trips from PNG to Can-
berra. I was able to use some recordings that Nicole made in 2003 as part of my
data set, and am grateful for this important contribution to my work.
    The ethnomusicologist Kirsty Gillespie also joined the Chanted Tales project
in 2003, and was awarded her doctorate this year for her research into creativity
and change in Duna song. She has been an inspiring colleague and a warm and
supportive friend. Kirsty made a number of excellent recordings of spoken Duna
texts in 2005 (listed in Appendix 1) and made these available for my use. These
have greatly added to the richness and quality of data I had available for analysis,
and include some of my favourite stories. There are also several language structures
and subtleties that I would have missed entirely were it not for Kirsty’s study of song
texts while we were in the field. It was great to work together and I look forward to
doing so again.
    I am grateful to my fellow students in the linguistics department at RSPAS, in
particular Carol Priestley and Antoinette Schapper, for their reading recommenda-
tions, problem-solving suggestions, thought-provoking discussions, and comrade-
ship. I only hope I can be half as enlivening and encouraging in Antoinette’s final
thesis months as she has been in mine. Extra thanks also to Bevan Barrett for always
answering my sudden random questions with poise and acuity, and to Susan Love
and Doug Marmion for their technical help.
    Many other scholars contributed to my research through their advice, discussion,
and encouragement at various times during my candidature. I am indebted to Alex-
andra Aikhenvald, Avery Andrews, Chris Ballard, Tom Ernst, Glenda Giles, Rachel
Hendery, Darja Hoenigman, Pascale Jacq, Gabriel Lomas, Elizabeth Minchin, Nick
Modjeska, Don Niles, Stephen Pattemore, Hans Reithofer, Bambi Schieffelin and
Dan Seeland. Discussing issues of evidentiality with Robyn Loughnane was es-
pecially stimulating and helpful for me, and I thank her for her insights and sug-
gestions. The attendees at the Monday morning Research Roundtable meetings at
ANU helped to get me through some dark thesis days.
    I am indebted to Kevin Murphy, Esther Fasnacht, and Esther’s late husband
Pierre, for their kindness and openheartedness in looking after me while I was in
Mt. Hagen, sending treats to the field, and taking care of my family members who
were able to visit. Kevin’s generosity in sharing his home made it possible for me
to stay and work in Hagen for an extended period when access to Lake Kopiago
was difficult, and I don’t know what I would have done without him. Pierre gave so
much in his life, and I am lucky to have known him and his family. Thanks also to
the other pilots, ground crew and office staff of the Missionary Aviation Fellowship,
and the staff at the Mt Hagen Missionary Home. These dedicated and hard-working
people solved a lot of problems for me, not to mention keeping me cheerful. Like
so many other PNG researchers, I also thank Jim Robins of the National Research
Institute in Port Moresby.

     My interest in New Guinea languages was sparked and developed by two caring,
energetic, and inspiring teachers, Bill Foley and Mark Donohue. I am profoundly
grateful to Bill and Mark for fostering the will and providing the opportunity for my
first trip to Papua New Guinea in 2000, which I undertook with Mark and another
great companion, Melissa Crowther. It was also around this time that I met Miriam
Corris, who has been a leading light for me throughout the writing of this thesis.
Warm thanks to Mim for her understanding and encouragement, and also for the
generosity and patience of her and her partner Phil Hayman in helping me with
formatting.
     My dear friends Anna Lockwood and Jessica Kemp were resident in Hewa and
Bogaia communities, neighbouring Duna country, on my first field trip in 2003-4.
Heartfelt thanks to both of them for all their stalwart and loving support, not to
mention providing me with a home at various times. Other people whom I wish to
thank for especially helping to make Canberra home and for urging me on with this
thesis are Matilda Thomas, Steph Garling, Yuri Cath, Ben Jeffares, Brett Calcott,
James Berrell, Maggie and Sweep, and my indomitable grandmother Ma’adi Miller.
     My family have been extremely supportive throughout my doctoral research,
as ever. My parents Craig and Georgina and sister Mehera undoubtedly planted
the seeds that gave me the confidence and curiosity to begin language study in
an unfamiliar country. Thanks also to their respective partners Jude Prichard, John
Diamond and Tim Edmond, and to my brother Matthew Hall and sister-in-law Anita
Bulan. Having my mum and John visit in the field was a wonderful experience, and I
am so glad they could come. Finally, there is my husband Chris Haskett, a powerful
sustaining force in my life since we met in 2004. Thank you, darling, for sticking
with me and keeping me going through this foolhardy project.

Other glossing conventionsIn example sentences I use a hyphen (-) to represent ligature between two morphemes where
(at least one) of the morphemes does not occur as a freestanding form. I use the equals sign
(=) to represent ligature for: bound morphemes that attach to the final predicate, but do not
occur in a primary inflectional capacity (§8.1.1.1), that is, epistemic particles (§10.4) and
the sentence-final markers =nia ASSERT and =pe ‘Q’ (§11.1); and dependent third person
pronouns (§6.6.3). I do not use ‘-’ versus ‘=’ to represent an overall distinction between
affixes and a clitics. A large number of the bound forms that I describe in this thesis are
arguably clitics on the basis of their distributional flexibility. However, a more developed
understanding of Duna phonology is necessary to explore the validity and applicability of
a clear clitic/affix distinction, and I use ‘=’ for morphemes which are anomalous in other
ways.
     Where a single Duna morpheme requires glossing with more than one English word,
these are separated by a full stop. In certain cases where a given morpheme encodes more
than one category or meaning I use a forward slash (/) to separate these two meanings.
     Words in example sentences that are clearly related to Tok Pisin and/or English words
are annotated ‘lw’ (for ‘loan word’) in the gloss. Some of the examples in this thesis in-
clude Duna words that belong to a “special esoteric vocabulary” (Haley 2002:132) called
kẽyaka. Kẽyaka terms are used extensively in song, but are not typically used in everyday
conversation or spoken narratives. Kẽyaka terms are indicated in example sentence glosses
with ‘k.’ preceding the approximate import of the word.
     In Chapters 9 to 11 approximations of perception events that are entailed by evidential
markers (§9.2) are shown in curly brackets in the English translation.
Chapter 1Introduction
1.1     The Duna community
1.1.1    Duna lands and people
Introduction    The Duna language is spoken by approximately 25,000 people liv-
ing in the north-west corner of Southern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea
(Figure 1.1).1 The word ‘Duna’ refers to both a language and a people. This term
(derived from a Huli designation, see §1.1.2) was adopted by the Australian admin-
istration and is now conventionally accepted as standard reference in English and
Tok Pisin; see Haley (2002:14). The indigenous self-designating term is Yuna. The
language is classified as a member of the Duna-Bogaya subgroup of the Trans New
Guinea family (Wurm 1975; Ross 2005a).2
    Duna lands extend from the headwaters of the Pori and Tumbudu Rivers in
the south-east, through the river valleys to the Strickland River in the north-west
(Figure 1.2), and lie within the Koroba-Lake Kopiago district of the province. The
information that I provide in this section predominantly applies to the north-western
Duna region (§1.2.1), particularly the Lake Kopiago area. This is where several
researchers who have contributed significantly to the available literature on Duna
were based, and is also where I conducted my own fieldwork (§1.3.1).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"

                        ari      ‘soon’
                        awe      ‘after’
                        ha       ‘immediately, hastily’
                        itane    ‘later’
                        ikane    ‘in a bit (sooner than itane)’
                        hapia    ‘before, immediately, hastily’
3.9. Interrogatives                                                                                91
    Some time/manner terms have only a ‘time-ordering’ sense, that is they desig-
nate the time of a predicated activity in relation to other times and events. This is
true of itane, ikane, ala, and ari. The first three terms are free adverbials, that is,
expressions that are not limited to a particular position in the clause. Ari is unique
in the set in that it occurs post-verbally. This morpheme is very rare in my data.
    The time/manner terms ha and hapia have both a time-ordering sense (‘imme-
diately’) and a manner sense (‘hastily, quickly’). The form ha always occurs imme-
diately preceding the predicate (see, for example, (633)). The terms hapia ‘before’
and awe ‘later’ do not have a fixed position as adverbial elements, but typically oc-
cur either sentence-initially (148) or following a subject NP (253). They can also

     The ailment nouns siki ‘sickness’ and malaria ‘malaria, (fever, sickness)’ are clearly derived
from English/Tok Pisin. I assume that the constructions using the two new terms are based upon
an original construction, naki sa-. Haley (2002:111) reports that khenekene was originally used to
refer to influenza (§1.1.3); it appears to be derived from a reduplication of the nominal/verbal root
khene(-) ‘die, death’.

in some expressions the ailment noun (or NP) occupies the P participant slot that is
subcategorised for by the bivalent verb that it occurs with, and is an object NP.
    Firstly, it can be seen that although one can view the ailment as affecting the
experiencer, it is not the subject of the bivalent verb in the construction. Examples
(614) and (615) show different uses of the noun malaria. In (614), malaria heads a
subject NP in an ordinary bivalent clause headed by the verb kole- ‘break, split’. The
NP is marked as a contrasted subject with the morpheme -ka. Example (615a) shows
the noun malaria occurring with the verb sa- ‘take, get’ as part of an ailment+verb
predication. It is not the subject of the clause and cannot be CS-marked, as shown
in (615b).","[289, 290]"

     The word maki in ‘mark out, choose’ is presumably derived from English ‘mark’ or Tok Pisin
‘makim’. As I have never noted this word occurring as a noun or verb I classify it as a verb adjunct
(rather than, for example, a serialised verb root or adjunct noun). It is not uncommon for Tok Pisin
verbs to be borrowed into Duna as verb adjuncts.

Verb adjunct constructions can be formed with the bivalent consonantal verbs suwa-

combinations of verb adjuncts with these verbs are shown in Table 7.9 and exem-
plified in (541) - (546).
    The complex predicates shown in Table 7.9 head bivalent clauses, that is, the
argument structure of the verb is the same as in simple predication. The verbs
contribute more or less recognisable semantic content. For example, kua- ‘hide’
relates generally to hiding things away and suwa- ‘hold’ to retaining, but sa- ‘take,
get’ does little beyond supplying a bivalent and telic frame.(541)     no antia-ka nane ambolo ndu ngora ki-tia.

7.5.1    Introduction
The kinds of complex predicates looked at so far involve morphemes that typically
occur as part of a predicating constituent.19 This section examines complex predic-
  19
   The exception to this is complex verbs that include a directional demonstrative. Directional
demonstratives have a wide range of functions and probably most typically occur as PlcP constituents
244                                         Chapter 7. Some complex predicate structures
ations involving nouns, morphemes that are typically used in participant reference.
These include some more idiomatic predications that are not easily identified as
structurally distinct and productive operations. Rather, a combination of certain
words in certain expressions appears to ‘borrow’ an existing grammatical structure
in the language in an idiomatic way.
   I begin by looking at two general classes of construction that I term ‘adjunct
noun constructions’ and ‘object-verb predications’.
    A complex predication with an ‘adjunct noun’ (§7.5.2)20 is one in which an un-
modified noun precedes a consonantal or wa-class verb, supplies semantic content
to the predication, and does not occupy an argument slot of the clause as required
by the verb. For example, if the verb is bivalent, the adjunct noun is additional to
(rather than replacing or making redundant) separate subject and object NPs that
may occur in the clause. The adjunct noun must follow other NPs, PPs and PlcPs in
the clause, although some other kinds of constituents (for example, temporals) may
be acceptably interposed between the adjunct noun and the verb.
    An ‘object-verb predication’ (§7.5.3) is one in which a nominal phrase occupies
the P argument slot of a consonantal or wa-class bivalent verb. The apparent object
NP works in construction with the verb to provide the meaning of the predication,
and so cannot be elided in the usual way (§4.2.3.3). Object-verb predications are
idiomatic, in that the structure as a whole can be assigned a ‘literal’ meaning that
is distinct from its typical interpretation (Nunberg et al. 1994). Specific pairings
of nouns and verbs in Duna object-verb predications differ as to whether they are
fixed expressions that structurally resemble adjunct noun constructions in certain
ways (being more restricted in terms of word order flexibility and NP complex-
ity/referentiality, and less semantically transparent) or more like independent object
NP and verb constituents in a typical bivalent clause.
    Section 7.5.4 discusses a number of further expressions employing the verb ka-
‘be/stand’ that do not clearly match the structure of the other kinds of complex pre-
dicates discussed. As a simple predicate, this verb occurs with monovalent sense.
However, in combination with certain nouns, nominal phrases, or adjectives, it ex-
hibits a constructional ambivalency; the introduction of a nominal or adjectival ele-
ment can apparently license an additional argument in the clause. These expressions
are thus different from adjunct noun constructions, in which the argument structure
of the verb is unchanged; and from object-verb predications, in which the colloca-or free adverbial elements.
   20
      I use the phrase ‘adjunct noun’ as an alternative to the phrase ‘adjunct (nominal)’ that is often
used in the Papuanist literature for nominal-like words that occur in constructions similar to those
described in this section. I use ‘noun’ rather than ‘nominal’ as in the Duna case the relevant words
are recognisable as ordinary common nouns.

tion of the object and the verb creates a special meaning.
    Finally, I look at special uses of existential verbs in the delineation of a relation-
ship of possession (§7.5.5.1) or proper inclusion (§7.5.5.2) between two items that
are expressed as NPs in the clause.","[269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274]"

  tactic description, Volume I: Clause structure, pp. 61–131. Cambridge: Cam-
  bridge University Press.",[519]
"7.5.2   Adjunct noun constructions
In an adjunct noun construction the predicate consists of a noun (N) and an con-
sonantal or wa-class verb. The noun cannot be analysed as denoting a participant
that is subcategorised for by the verb (it is not an argument), is non-referential, and
is typically not modified either lexically (for example, by a postposed adjective)
or morphologically (for example, by an NP marker). The noun is placed after all
other referring expressions that occur in the clause and usually immediately pre-
cedes the verb. The noun contributes to the semantics of the predicate in a way that
is semi-transparent, but is not predictable or productive.
    The general template for a typical adjunct noun construction is shown in Figure
7.4. This template resembles the structure of a verb adjunct construction in that a
non-verb element immediately precedes the verb, contributing to the meaning of the
predicate. However, unlike a verb adjunct construction, the argument structure of
the predication is entirely predictable from the verb, and the noun and verb cannot
be treated as comprising a unitary stem for the purposes of negation.

                      Figure 7.4 Typical ‘adjunct noun’ construction     An example of an adjunct noun construction is shown in (547a). The predicate
consists of the bivalent verb suwa- ‘hold’ in combination with the common noun re
‘eye’ and means ‘watch closely, guard’. The clause includes both a subject NP (no,
‘I’) and object NP (anda ‘house’), and as the verb is bivalent there is no subcatgor-
ised participant slot left that re could be occupying as an argument. In all elicited
and textual examples of this construction, the noun re ‘eye’ immediately precedes
the verb. However, in constructed sentences placing the day-term hata between the
adjunct noun and the verb as in (547b) was judged acceptable, showing that the
noun is not formally bound to the verb root. Another example that includes the
expression re suwa- is shown in (548).

noun with suwa- ‘hold’. This expression means ‘count time periods’, and relates

a monovalent predicate that means ‘marry (with a man)’.21 Example (553) shows
that the adjunct noun cannot precede the subject NP no ‘I’. Example (554) shows
that when it occurs in construction with nga- the noun anoa ‘man’ is not a suit-
able candidate to head a full NP; further information concerning the nature of the
marrying partner is expressed through the addition of a pair-marked NP (§5.4.1).22(552)    no phukao-ya no anoa nga-ya...

     The bivalent verb rou- is used to describe a man marrying a woman.

     When using a referential NP that denotes a particular husband (‘X’), it is more usual to use an
alternative idiom, ‘go to X’s house’ to describe marriage, as shown in (551).

constructions such as those shown in (547a) to (552) are not usually negated as a
unit, as shown by the unacceptability of (555a). Negation can be expressed through
applying the negative circumfix to the verb only, as shown in (555b). Example
(555b) shows that in an alternative interrogative (§11.1.3.4) the nominal may be
omitted at the second iteration of the predicate.(555)   a. * Juli anoa ngo=pe na-anoa nga-ya

                   Figure 7.5 Template of an ‘object-verb predication’
    Object-verb predications are predications that involve an NP and a verb. They
do not really represent a single formally distinct construction type, as the major
defining criterion is semantic and gradient rather than structural and categorically
discrete. Clauses that include object-verb predications show some characteristics
of ordinary bivalent clauses with subject and object NPs. They also share similar-
ities with adjunct noun constructions in that word order is typically restricted, and
the meaning of the predication is substantially derived from a nominal constituent.
Object-verb predications are similar to ‘restricted collocations’ (Cowie 1998), com-
binations of words where the meaning of one element is “governed by its association
with another word or phrase” (Pawley 2007:7), for example, the expression ‘meet
demands’ in English. They are also idiomatic under Nunberg et al.’s (1994) defini-
tion in that the meaning cannot be predicted from the sum of its parts, and a literal

        ‘dance’

        e.g. heka ‘bird ’        eya                       na-         ‘hang oneself’
        ‘cord, fibre ’            ‘eat’
interpretation of the phrase is cases possible, albeit rather odd. Some examples of
object-verb predications are shown in Table 7.10.
    It can be seen in Table 7.10 that some object-verb predications are part of a
family of expressions which follow a generalised semantic structure, rather than
being one-off expressions. For example, the existential verb (e)ra- ‘be/put’ occurs
in construction with nouns that denote bodily substances in clauses that describe
extrusion or excretion. The more members there are of the family, the more tenable
it becomes to say that what we are dealing with here is (constructional) polysemy
of the verb (see also §7.5.4.2).
   Examples (556) - (560) illustrate some of the expressions shown in Table 7.10.
The apparent ‘object’ noun is unmodified and immediately precedes the verb.(556)   khia ra-nda          ma   ru.

        ‘I will hang myself.’ (lit. eat rope) (ED)    As with adjunct nominal constructions, placing the ‘object’ noun before the sub-
ject argument usually doesn’t work; see (561) and (562). This kind of inflexibility
argues against treating the expression as a typical bivalent clause (as subject and
object NPs can normally appear in either SO or OS order, the latter being pragmat-
ically marked).(561)   * heka imane su
          bird girl      hold.PFV
        * A woman transformed into a bird (CD/XIV:76)
        (Could mean: ‘A woman held a bird.’)(562)   * eya no nanda
          cord 1SG eat-INT
        * I will hang myself (CD/XIV:156)
        (Could mean: ‘I will eat cord’)    However, for at least some expressions, the nominal appears to be the head of a
full NP that references a P argument. In (563) the noun is modified by an adjective.
In (564) the noun is marked as specific (that is, is clearly referential) and does not
occur in the same clause as its host verb but in the preceding clause, that is, the
item is referenced through zero anaphora. In (564), there is no reason to analyse
mbalutana ‘the plane’ as anything other than an object NP, beyond the fact that it
collocates with a particular specialised meaning of the verb suwa- ‘hold’. This is
not in itself sufficient grounds to propose a distinct structural relationship.(563)   ho-na         nane kete si-tia        ri-na.

        (T/JP:KG05V7.11)    Individual object-verb predications show some differences concerning whether
or not the nominal element and the verb in the construction must be immediately
contiguous. For example, for the phrase khiau suwa- ‘use fire-making kit’, it is
possible for the time/manner word ala to occur in between the constituents (565),
and a locative NP can occur between hapa ‘egg’ and era- ‘put’ in the expression
‘lay eggs’ (566). See also the phrase mali suwa- ‘hold a mali dance’ in (549), in
which an (interrogative) temporal occurs in between the noun and the verb.(565)   no hawa na-nda            khiau ala suwa-nda...

        ‘Now the kango bird lays its eggs in trees [they] say.’ (T/HS:080305ib)     However, RA and KK judged that the phrase heka suwa- ‘transform into a bird’
does not allow a temporal to be interposed, as shown in (567) and (568). The expres-
sion is fixed, and the special meaning it has cannot be maintained if arrangement of
its elements is disrupted.(567)   imane ndu (ala) heka (*ala) su.

        girl   one yesterday bird yesterday hold.PFV
        ‘A young woman (yesterday) turned into (*yesterday) a bird.’ (CD/XIV:76)    Like adjunct noun constructions, object-verb predications do not undergo unit-
ary negation. If the negative circumfix is used it will be applied to the verb only. An
example is shown in (569). However, the lexical negator neya (§8.3.3) is preferred
for object-verb predications.(569)   imane-na heka su=pe, na-si-ya.

7.5.4     Inceptive/factitive uses of ka- ‘be/stand’
7.5.4.1    Adjunct noun type
The verb ka- ‘be/stand’ can occurs in construction with a noun that cannot be iden-
tified as denoting an argument, is unmodified, and immediately precedes the verb,
that is, resembles an adjunct noun. However, the derived predication may be either
ambivalent or bivalent. This goes against the usual pattern of adjunct noun con-
structions, in that the argument structure of the complex predication is different
from that of the verb when it occurs alone as a simple predicate. A general template
for constructions that use employ ka- in this way is shown in Figure 7.6.

means ‘begin’. This can head a monovalent clause, as in (570), or a bivalent clause
as in (571).(570)     hata       ka-ta         arene      se     kutia.

          (IV/KK-KY:KG05)    Nominals that denote liquids or transferrable substances such as dirt or mud
occur like adjunct nouns with ka- ‘be/stand’ to describe saturation or staining, as
shown in (572) and (573). Example (573) shows that adverbial modifiers such as
peli ‘well, thoroughly’ can either precede the nominal or be interposed between the
nominal and the verb (but not both at the same time).(572)     no slipas iwa-ta         nga-yaroko, khiapo ndola-ya, haka khiapo

Other complex predicates with ka- ‘be/stand’ are more like object-verb predications.
In combination with certain nouns, ka- appears to have the bivalent sense ‘make’,
as shown in (576) - (578). The nominal occurs in an NP that refers to the ‘made’
item. A general template for a clause in which ka- has this ‘make’ sense is shown
in Figure 7.7.23

    This construction relates to possessive expansion of existential clauses (§7.5.5.1), in that a
monovalent existential verb is used as a quasi-bivalent predicate to describe a relationship between
two items.

Some adjectives can be marked with verbal inflections and head verbal clauses.
Verbal clauses headed by an adjective are monovalent and generally atelic, describ-
ing a constant state rather than a changing process. Alternatively, adjectival roots
may occur as part of a complex predicate preceding the verb ka- ‘be/stand’. The
general pattern of this construction is represented in Figure 7.8. As can be seen
from a comparison of this structure with that shown in Figure 7.3, the adjectival
root is somewhat equivalent to a verb adjunct in a verb adjunct construction.

    Complex predicates composed of an adjective + ka- show similar properties to
verb adjunct constructions in that ka- supplies an inceptive/factitive frame but little
semantic content. They are also similar in that they may be negated by the negative
circumfix as a single unit, as shown in (585a). In this case both RA and KK felt that
negating the verb only as in (585b) was equally acceptable.(585)     a. ka ipa roro ko=pe,                  na-roro ka-ya.

7.5.5.1    Expressing possession
In many non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea existential clauses can be ‘ex-
panded’ to express possession (Rumsey 2002). In this section I provide examples of
the three major Duna existential verbs ka- ‘be/stand’, ra- ‘be/sit’ and era- ‘be/put’
as they occur in this kind of possessive clause.
    The relationship between an existential clause (examples (586) - (588)) and an
expanded existential possessive clause (examples (589) - (593)) is summarised in
Figure 7.9. The grammatical status of the NPs in expanded existential clauses is
discussed further at the close of this section.

    Example (596) shows the evidentially-marked verb karua heading a monovalent
existential clause, and example (597) shows the same verb form in an expanded
possessive clause with a third person possessor. This verb form is not acceptable
with a speaker subject in a declarative sentence (598), nor is it appropriate to a
speaker possessor (599).(596)     guapa rowa ndu ka-rua.

          ? I have two pigs {I saw} (ED/XV:19)    The oddness of the use of the visual evidential in (599) could also be because
this morpheme has a distancing effect (§11.2.2.6). It sounds strange to describe
one’s own possessive relationship with something using a morpheme that implies
one has nothing to do with the predicated state. Nevertheless, there remains some
justification for regarding the possessor as a subject in this situation. The structure
of an expanded existential clause under this reading is represented as in Figure 7.10.
The possessor is a subject, and the possessed item—which continues to control the
existential verb that is selected—is like an object NP in an object-verb predication.

7.5.5.2    Existential verb as copula
As described in §4.1.1.1, nominal phrases can occur as non-verbal predicates in
clauses that express relationships of equation and attribution. These are generally
understood to describe relationships that are currently observable. Alternatively, the
time-frame of a relationship of proper inclusion can be made explicit through the
addition of an existential verb. This verb serves as a copula, forming a complex

This section describes a range of constructions that are grouped together on the
semantic basis that they describe involuntary experience (cf. Pawley et al. 2000).
As the subject argument in clauses headed by involuntary experience predications
in non-volitional, some morphological operations (for example, CS-marking of the
subject argument, see §6.6.1) and typical structural restrictions (for example, the
dispreference for evidential marking in a clause with an informant subject, see
§11.2.2) are not maintained as typical correlates of subject identity.
    The different kinds of complex predicates that describe involuntary experience
can generally be identified as structurally analogous (to at least some extent) with
one of the constructions described in §7.4 or §7.5. Sections §7.6.1.1 and §7.6.1.2
describe two kinds of predications that are composed of a noun in combination with
a verb, and show some similarities to the adjunct noun and object-verb predications
described in §7.5.2 and §7.5.3, respectively. In §7.6.2.1 I look at four ‘involuntary
experience expressions’ which are perhaps derived from verb adjunct predications,
but show features suggestive of lexicalisation as nominal/verbal roots in at least two
cases. Section 7.6.2.2 examines clauses that include ‘emotion words’, which can
function as either verbal roots, or as nominal roots in construction with a verb.","[274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287]"

     The main divergence from Giles’ orthography is in the representation of the voiceless stops:
Giles represents aspirated stops as p, t, k and unaspirated stops as b, d, g. Whilst not ideal, the
orthography I use here (using ph, s, kh) arose as a functional stop-gap adjusted to the current literacy
situation of Duna speakers in the Lake Kopiago area. All the Duna speakers with whom I spoke
about this issue strongly associated the graphemes g, d, g with prenasalised stops, and found the
employment of these letters to represent voiceless stops extremely confusing and very obstructive
to reading or writing Duna. A major effort to train people in the conventions of the standard (that
is, Giles’) orthography will be necessary in order to make this system viable in the north-west Duna
region.
Chapter 3Word classes
3.1    Introduction
This chapter introduces Duna word classes as referred to in this thesis, identifying
different groups to which a root form may belong, and which predict certain aspects
of a word’s use, including its distribution, function, and structural capacities. The
chapter includes some additional comments on features of certain word classes or
subclasses that are not discussed in detail elsewhere in this thesis, and lists all known
members of smaller closed classes for quick reference.
    The word types I present here are largely categories that can be defined on the
basis of morphosyntactic characteristics. For example, roots that belong to the class
of verbs can be marked with certain bound forms that are not generally applicable to
the members of other classes. However, the types are functionally and semantically
as well as formally motivated, and in some cases no clearly distinguishing morpho-
syntactic features are identified; certain words are presented together because they
belong to the same kind of semantic domain, or share a similar function.
    Sections 3.2 and 3.3 describe formal and functional features of the major Duna
word classes, nominals and verbs. Members of the nominal and verb classes are
generally used in denoting entities and events, respectively, and are thus typically
fundamental to establishing fairly basic ingredients of a described situation (who are
the participants, what are they doing?). Nominals are divided into two open classes
(common nouns and proper names), and one closed class, personal pronouns. The
overall category of verb contains three closed classes of morphologically and func-
tionally distinct verbal roots, as well as an open class of regular verbs.
    Verb adjuncts (§3.4) are similar to verbs but have somewhat distinct distribu-
tional properties, and adjectives (§3.5) comprise a class of words which show both
nominal and verbal properties.
   The closed classes of quantifiers and demonstratives are treated in §3.6 and §3.7,
and §3.8 looks at a ‘mixed bag’ of words and expressions that are used in talking                                           69
70                                                          Chapter 3. Word classes
about time and manner. Duna interrogative forms (§3.9) group together as a func-
tional class, but also cut across the classes described in §3.2 - §3.8. Sections 3.10
and 3.11 describe some other minor groups of words, including dependent postposi-
tional modifiers, linkers, sentence pro-forms, and some conventionalised utterances
or ‘sound gestures’ such as attention-seekers and exclamations.","[97, 98, 99]"
"4.2.4.2     Fronting
An object or oblique may be fronted and occur first in the clause.26 Fronting typical-
ly indicates that a referring expression is pragmatically prominent and focussed in
some way. For example, the phrase may constitute information that fills a perceived
gap in the hearer’s knowledge; the fronted phrase is in ‘new’ (or ‘completive’) fo-
cus (Dik 1989:392). This is seen in examples (90) - (93) which show first a situ-
ation described in unmarked word order, and then three question and answer pairs
in which a missing participant is placed at the beginning of the answer sentence.
These sentences show fronting of an object NP (91), a PP headed by the instrument
postposition -ka ‘INSTR’ (92), and an NP marked with -ra ‘CNCL’ (93). PK judged
that these sentences would only be acceptable utterances as answers to the relevant
question.27 (90)     na       anda khou-ra            phuya ndu rowa-ka            so.

               2SG.CS what kill.PFV
               ‘What did you kill?’  24
      The definition of left dislocation is confined by some scholars (see e.g., Foley 2007:443) to
describing constructions that involve copying. Left movement (and typically also broken intonation)
that does not involve copying may be referred to as ‘topicalisation’. However I do not use the latter
term for this as I use the word ‘topical’ elsewhere in a somewhat different sense, and because it seems
appropriate to use a single term for both construction types in Duna as they function similarly.
   25
      Thus, my use of this term is broad, and does not refer specifically to situations in which the
constituent in question is is represented by a pronominal element (or zero anaphora) in the clause,
and by an NP in the right dislocated phrase.
   26
      This is of course only observable if a constituent that would be predicted to occur before the
fronted constituent is present in the clause. For example, an object that is the only NP in a clause
will be clause-initial but is not ‘fronted’.
   27
      In this ‘answer to a question’ situation, there is a preference for fronted participants to be overtly
marked as indefinite with the quantifier ndu (see also §5.2.3.3). For example, when I first suggested
the constituent arrangement shown in (92), I did not have ndu within the instrument-referent NP, and
this was corrected by PK who thought that the sentence sounded much better with ndu included.

              Inside the house I killed the snake.’ (CED)    Fronting may also mark contrast in which, broadly, one participant is ‘substi-
tuted’ for another (Vallduvı́ 1992:71-2).28 In (94), the object NPs of a negative and
a positive clause are fronted and contrasted. The hypothetical context is that two
people are talking over who went to the market that day. (94) ko no na-ke-ya,              Manari no ke-o.
         2SG 1SG NEG-see-NEG PSN             1SG see-PFV
         ‘You I didn’t see, Manari I saw.’ (CED/VIII:171)    In textual data it is noticeable that fronting occurs within clauses that itemise
a set of parallel events, as in (95) and (96). In the examples the fronted NP is
underlined. Fronting maintains parallel structure across the clauses as the contrast
argument always occurs first, building up a set of items. (95) ndulu kone, ho-ra-me                   ra-ya,      ita yopo        ho-ra-me           yaki

         (T/YS:270205)
  28
     From the available data this kind of ‘contrastive’ fronting in Duna seems to correspond closely
to ‘parallel’ and ‘replacing’ contrastive focus within Dik’s (1989) typology. However, this is a
preliminary observation only as I do not know the full range of situations in which fronting may
occur in Duna.

          ‘To me Metai gave banana.’ (To whom did Metai give banana?) (CD/VII:23)4.2.4.3    Left dislocation
Subjects, objects, possessors, and obliques may be left dislocated.29 In such con-
structions, it is typical for the left dislocated element to be something the speaker
assumes the hearer already knows about (but cannot otherwise identify), while the
remainder of the clause provides new information. A left dislocated constituent in
Duna thus corresponds to Foley’s (2007:404) definition of a topic, “the link which
ties the information communicated in this sentence with what has preceded”.30
    In (101) and (102),31 the left dislocated ‘links’ (shown in bold type) correspond
to things that have recently been introduced into the text. Morphological marking on
the left dislocated NP reflects the participant’s clause-internal semantic role and/or
  29
      In examples in the textual data, obliques are fronted with broken intonation, but are not copied.
I have not tested whether copying is possible for all kinds of oblique constituents.
   30
      Compare also Vallduvi’s ‘link’ elements in information structure that are necessarily sentence-
initial (1992:48), and “point toward the address in the hearer’s knowledge store under which the
information of the sentence must be entered” (1992:62).
   31
      In some instances letters are substituted for proper names because the names represent special-
ised knowledge and it is not appropriate for me to reproduce them.

     In (102c), the speaker reiterates more precisely the meaning of no ame as used in the previous
sentences; that is, that the relationship goes back several generations. This sentence is not spoken
fluently but broken by several pauses. The status of these units as either left dislocated material or
afterthought expansions, or a combination of both, is not clear to me.

   Example (104) shows an NP that is left dislocated when its referent is already

Beanstalk. The bean seed (mbatano eke) has been introduced into the narrative
previously and referred to several times when the main character (a boy) sees and
buys the bean at a market. It has not been referenced for six clauses which detail
the boy’s return home and his attempt to conceal his activities from his watchful
mother.(105)     kho ha      hoa-ta     ka-ta           mbatano eke-na    anda hane

activation builds on the fact that a participant is already known, that is, is a potential
link.","[150, 151, 152, 153, 154]"
"4.1.4    Trivalent clauses
Trivalent clauses are headed by a predicate that semantically requires three parti-
cipants. The few trivalent predicates that I know of in Duna10 can be generally char-
acterised as ‘transfer’ events, so that the participants include something (concrete
or abstract) that is transferred, somewhere that it is transferred to, and something
that effects the transfer. I refer to the item that fills the ‘transferer’ slot in a trivalent
clause as the A argument (equivalent to the A argument of bivalent clauses), the
transferred item as the T (theme) argument, and the item it is transferred to as the R
(recipient) argument.
    T and R arguments can be realised as unmarked NPs or have zero anaphoric
reference (§4.2.3.3). An R argument may alternatively be realised as a LOC-marked
NP.
     Three examples of trivalent clauses are shown in (57) to (59). In each example
all three arguments are realised in the clause as nominal phrases. The R argument
is an unmarked NP and precedes the T argument NP. This exemplifies typical word
order when both R and T are expressed in the clause as unmarked NPs. (57) hina-ka no ki            nguani ngua-na=nia.

    I know of only one productively trivalent verb, ngua- ‘give’. I recorded also one trivalent verb
adjunct construction ware ka- ‘show be/stand’ (for which the idea of ‘transfer’ is rather more meta-
phorical, relating to the transfer of knowledge of the T argument rather than the item itself), and
some further trivalent verb serialisations such as ruwa ngua- (say give) ‘tell, explain’ and mbara ka-
(know make) ‘teach’.

    In (60) - (63) the R argument is a LOC-marked NP. This pattern of realisation is
quite common in the textual data,11 and is typically used in describing situations in
which a transfer is partial or temporary, rather than a complete change of ownership
or control. For example, (60) shows KK’s request to me to borrow my binoculars
for a moment so that he could look through them, not to have them as a permanent
gift. A LOC-marked R argument NP generally follows rather than precedes a T
argument NP, as seen in these examples (where both R and T NPs are present); see

4.2.1    Arguments and adjuncts
Sections 4.1.2 - 4.1.4 have outlined how nominal phrases in verbal clauses may de-
note arguments, that is, participants that are semantically required by the predicate.
These include the S argument of monovalent clauses; the A argument of multivalent
clauses; the P argument of bivalent clauses; and the R and T arguments of trivalent
clauses. Nominal phrases, place phrases (PlcP, §6.4) and postpositional phrases
(PP, §6.5) may also be included in the clause as adjuncts, denoting items that are
not strictly entailed by the predicate but which ‘flesh out’ the description of the
situation, for example describing a setting in which it takes place or an instrument
  11
     For example, in a sample of 28 clauses headed by the trivalent verb ngua- ‘give’ the R argument
is realised as an unmarked NP eight times and a LOC-marked NP four times (and elided 16 times).

that is employed in its accomplishment. A nominal, place, or postpositional phrase
stands in a particular relation to the structure of the clause in which it occurs. In this
section I identity three such relations: subject, object, and oblique.
    The criteria I use for identifying these relations are varied: a subject is defined
on the basis of argument type (that is, represents a grouping of S and A arguments);
an object as a particular NP realisation of certain arguments; and an oblique through
reference to morphological marking and/or non-argument status.","[133, 134, 135]"

         ‘Metai is at home {you saw}?’ (LC)    The above examples suggest that visual evidentials can further imply the rela-
tionship between subject/predicate and informant even where the informant is not an
argument of the clause. The idea of non-involvement can extend beyond the clause-
internal argument-predicate relationship to the ‘real-world’ informant-subject rela-
tionship. For example, the subject of a sentence marked for visual evidence should
not be in a close familial relationship with the informant, where the predicate de-
scribes an activity that subject and informant habitually engage in together (even if
they are not doing so at the time of utterance).
    Speakers may manipulate this effect, using visual morphemes in describing
events that they wish to disassociate themselves from,26 or to emphasise that a situ-
  26
     For example, when I was eliciting data concerning somewhat taboo topics such as sexual rela-
tions, KP would typically suggest sentences that were marked as either reported with the verb ruwa-
‘say’ (§10.5.2) or with visual evidentials.

        ‘In the morning I came, you waited in ambush, you struck me, struck as
        hard as you could {I saw}. (T/HS:080305iii)    The use of a visual evidential as a distancing device may also be appropriate for
reasons of politeness. For example, on one occasion I went for a walk by myself
and inconsiderately entered someone else’s garden without their permission. On
my return to the house, Haya Suku questioned where I had been, and asked me to
describe the garden that I had trespassed upon. I replied that it had a guava tree in it,
using the stative form of the verb ka- ‘be/stand’, kei, to describe the tree’s existence.
Haya reprovingly corrected this to the visual stative form karua. Upon my repetition
of this form, she praised me for speaking properly. Presumably, Haya found my use
of kei to be presumptuous in this case. I should not have been in a position to assert
the existence of this tree in the first place, and it was more appropriate for me to
back off, and describe the contents of the garden as an outside observer.
     As is intimated by this incident, a speaker may also choose not to use an eviden-
tial where it would be semantically apposite, in order to assert a close relationship
with the subject or activity of the predicate. For example, in relating rindi malu
(‘land history/geneaology’, see §1.3.3.1) the speaker avoids evidentially marked
morphemes which may effectively reduce their connection to the (true) events they
relate. In identifying a particular (extant but not at the time visible) tree or stone
as the marker of an important site (such as the site of the death of an ancestor), the
speaker will not use the visual evidential -rua on the existential verb, even though
this may be appropriate from a purely ‘information source’ point of view. Simil-
arly they will not use notional previous evidentials (§9.2.6.3) when describing the
lives of their ancestors (though, strictly speaking, they may be known about from
third-hand type sources), opting instead for the evidentially unmarked perfective
inflection -o (§8.2.2.1). This inflection, by default at least, carries connotations of
the speaker’s personal involvement in the narrated events (§9.2.9).
    De Haan (2005) argues that evidentiality should be understood as a deictic cat-
egory, that “fulfills the same function for marking relationships between speakers
and actions/events that, say, demonstratives do for marking relationships between
speakers and objects”. In accordance with this view, the examples looked at in this
section suggest that Duna evidential marking is part of a deictic practice as dis-
cussed by Hanks (2005), which speakers may engage in “not to position objects [or
438                                      Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type

dication of the direction in which something is done (§7.2.2). As referring demon-
stratives they typically occur in phrases that denote locations, rather than people or
objects (§6.4.4.4).
    There is much further work to be done in reaching a good understanding of the
relative and absolute spatial contrasts that the directional demonstratives express.
The terms sopa ‘below’ and roma ‘above’ function as cardinal direction terms, as
well as relative height descriptors. Sopa designates ‘down valley’ (north-west), and
roma ‘up valley’ (south-east); see also examples (389) and (390) in §6.4.4.4. This
reflects the direction in which waters drain through Duna country, flowing down
towards the Strickland River (Figure 1.2). See Haley (2002) for discussion of the
significance of these terms in Duna geography and cosmology.

       There is some evidence that ha can also be understood to mean ‘then, at another time’.

    I have found it difficult to identify systematic contrast between wa, eto, epa and
apo in a way that is consistent with all examples of these forms in the data, and the
gloss terms I use are either an approximation of their typical usage, or a semantically
empty formal label. Wa is typically associated with locations a short distance (for
example, a few metres or less) away from the speaker. Eto most commonly refers to
mid-distance locations to the fore of the speaker, and/or in a cross-valley direction.
For example, from my fieldhouse in Rewapi, the airstrip (at a lower altitude than
Rewapi, some 3km in a north-east direction), and other locations along this path,
were eto. Other things that were right in front of the speaker, at a distance of more
than a few metres, could also be eto. Epa seems to be used primarily in designating
locations and directions to the side of the speaker. For example, someone who is
looking to the side in order to avoid meet the gaze of someone who is standing in
front of them is looking epa. Apo is associated with greater distances than the other
terms, and movement on a level plane away from a deictic centre.","[116, 117]"

structures laid out in Table 7.1. However, many also show particular non-predictable
characteristics, relating for example to morphological composition, argument struc-
ture, or degree of lexicalisation. Some complex predications (particularly examples
of those structures that include a nominal) are idiomatic, comprising a convential-
ised expression the meaning of which cannot be predicted from knowledge of the                                           218
7.1. Introduction                                                                  219
constiutents as they occur in isolation from each other (Nunberg et al. 1994:492).
    In the first four sections of this chapter I proceed from complex predicates in
which the morphemic components are highly bound (for example, as a unitary stem
that cannot be separated) to those more idiomatic constructions in which the com-
ponents are free lexemes or phrases that are semantically rather than formally inter-
dependent.
    Section 7.2 describes the derivation of complex verbs through the addition of
a directional demonstrative root, bound aspectual/adverbial form, or participant-
adding morpheme. Sections 7.3 - 7.5 define three major types of complex predicate
construction with reference to the word class of the constituent that occurs in addi-
tion to a clause-final verb.
    In §7.3, I examine predicates that are composed of two or three verbs in series,
with an uninflected verb (or verbs) preceding an inflected verb. Typically verbs in
series must be contiguous, and the preferred method of negation with the negative
circumfix (§8.3) is ‘unitary’, that is, with the circumfix surrounding the whole series
as a single stem. Some verbs in series describe distinct activities; some are lexic-
alised to refer to a single activity that is not necessarily predictable from the mean-
ing of the individual verb roots; and some occur in ‘asymmetrical’ constructions
(Aikhenvald 2006) in which the last verb in the series aspectually or directionally
modifies the preceding verb.
    Section 7.4 concerns predicates that are composed of a verb in combination
with a ‘verb adjunct’ (§3.4). Both constituents can contribute to the meaning and
argument structure of the predicate. A verb adjunct typically immediately precedes
its host verb, and interposed constituents are generally dispreferred. The negative
circumfix can be applied either to the verb only, or to the verb adjunct + verb com-
bination as a whole.
    Complex predicates where a verb combines with a noun or NP are examined in
§7.5. The negative circumfix is not applied to the expression as a whole, but occurs
on the verb root only. The nominal element may be introduced into a clause in which
there is no argument slot for it to occupy (occurring as an ‘adjunct noun’), or occur
with a multivalent verb for which it can be posited as an object NP in what I term
an ‘object-verb predication’. Typically the nominal element is a non-referential and
unmodified common noun, and subject to an ordering restriction that it must follow
other NPs, PPs, or PlcPs in the clause, but some variation in regard to these features
is allowable.
    Section 7.5 describes some further families of minor constructions that consist
of an NP or adjective in combination with the existential verb ka- ‘be/stand’. It also
discusses some special predicating structures that include existential verbs and are

concerned with the expression of possession and proper inclusion.
    Section 7.6 looks at complex predicates that describe involuntary experience.
These represent a variety of construction types that are related but not identical
to some of those described in §7.3 - §7.5, and are grouped together on a largely
semantic basis.","[247, 248, 249]"
"4.1.1.2    Adjectival predicates
An adjectival root can occur as the predicate of a non-verbal clause, as in (27) and
(28), expressing an attribute of an NP argument. (27)     nane ha-na         uka kone.

          ‘That boy is very tall.’ (CD/XV:5)
   2
      However, the two possibilities are not equivalent in terms of information structure, as the re-
ordered clause Paka no rindi is more appropriate to a situation in which we are being informed
about the place Paka rather than about the speaker’s homeland.
    3
      Although I have not tested this, it seems possible that example (25) could be acceptable as the
response to a question such as ‘Who is Fred’s wife?’; i.e., when the NP Mbara ima can be interpreted
as having a particular referent rather than being a generic term.

Adjectives more commonly head verbal rather than non-verbal clauses, as they are
typically marked with verbal inflections when they occur as simple predicates; see
§4.1.2.4.
    A phrase that includes the dependent form mo ‘like’ (see also §5.2.2) is func-
tionally equivalent to an adjective. These adjectival expressions can also occur as
predicates of non-verbal clauses as exemplified in (29) and (30).","[126, 127]"
"7.3.3.1    Sequential and overlapping activities
Some verb series describe a series of distinct activities time iconically. The activity
described by the first verb in the series is completed before the activity described
by the next verb begins. Vn is typically telic. An example is shown in (493) (see
also example 482). The verb roots are bivalent, and the identity of the A and P
participants is the same for both verbs.(493)     ita sei si-ya    rindi ho-ta     kiti-pa.
          pig hit hold-DEP ground here-LOC descend-IMP
          ‘Kill pigs and take them down to the ground there’ (T/YS:270205)    Some verbs in series describe activities that are more-or-less discernible as dis-
tinct activities, but there is a significant amount of overlap between them. The
activity of the first verb continues throughout the activity of the second verb and
the meaning of the SVC is typically related to relocating something. Two examples
are shown in (494) and (495). Vn is a bivalent verb of ‘retaining’ and Vlast is a
monovalent verb of motion. The subject is the same for both verbs in series.(494)     ka       anda ho-nga    ndu yaki hoa-ta      iri-na.

7.3.3.2    Purposive serialisation
Serialised verbs may have a purposive relationship, in which Vlast is done so that
Vn can be done.10 Examples are shown in (496) - (500).(496)     ima-na,        ka       ke ma        ru-narua.

          ‘Go in order to speak so that Sakane may hear [he] said...’ (TLIV/KK:230205)     Purposive serialisation goes against the principle of time iconicity as observ-
able in sequential and overlapping constructions, as the activity described by the
last verb in the series happens before the (intended) activity of the first verb. For
some verb combinations there is a ‘typical’ reading of either purposive or sequen-
tial/overlapping. For example, the serialisation of si ‘hold’ and a verb of motion
normally has an overlapping relationship, whereas serialisation of sei ‘take’ and a
verb of motion normally has a purposive relationship. This is exemplified in the
exchange shown in (501).
  10
     A functionally similar purposive construction is achieved by using a verb marked with a suffix
-nda ‘PURP’, homophonous with the intentive final inflection (§8.2.2.3), as a medial form; see for
example (686) in §8.2.4.1. This kind of construction—that is, future-like marking on a non-final verb
to express the purpose of a following verb—also occurs in other (not closely related) languages of
the Highlands region, for example Ku Waru (Merlan and Rumsey 1991:330) and Kaluli (Schieffelin
1986:583-4). The Kaluli construction parallels the Duna construction very closely in that the inflec-
tion used in (same subject) medial purposives is homophonous with a final inflection that Scheiffelin
terms the ‘Intentive 1’. The Kaluli ‘Intentive 1’ final inflection is similar in meaning to the Duna
intentive final inflection. Thus in both cases we see a suffixal form that marks speaker intention (in
statements) on final clauses, and expresses a purposive relationship with respect to the following
verb on medial clauses.

                ‘You come and get it!’ (OH/V:37)    It is possible for the same combination of verbs to vary according to context as
to whether they show a purposive or overlapping relationship. In (502) and (503)
the relationship between the verbs yaki ‘carry’ and nga- ‘go’ is overlapping and pur-
posive, respectively. These sentences were elicited/constructed around two different
hypothetical scenarios that were elaborated and reiterated throughout one elicitation
session. One scenario was that the speaker had been digging out peanuts (example
(502)), and one was that someone else’s (Kipu’s) whereabouts were being queried
and explained (example (503)). In real situations there is likely to be further phys-
ical evidence (for example, a bag full of peanuts) that supports the apt interpretation
of a formally ambiguous sentence.(502)     ngalipe ruka yaki ngui.

          ‘Kipu has gone (in order) to dig out and carry peanuts.’ (CED/VIII:176)7.3.3.3    Integrated activities and lexicalisation
In some verb series it is semantically or logically problematic to distinguish the
verbs as representing separable activities; rather, the combination of two verbs
seems to describe one activity. These combinations are usually highly lexicalised,
so that the meaning of this activity is only partly predictable from the individual
meanings of the verbs.11 Some integrated activity and/or highly lexicalised serial
verb combinations are shown in Table 7.3 and exemplified in (504) - (510).
    Examples (504) and (505) show the expression ke- ra- (lit. ‘see be/put’) which
refers to studying something attentively. In (504), Sane Noma explains his theory
that Europeans designed helicopters after observing the distinctive way a dragonfly
flies, that is, hovering at stationary points along a zig-zag path of travel. In (505)
Kenny Kendoli describes going to inspect and size up some land that he was think-
ing of developing as a house and garden site.
  11
    I use apparent complete contemporaneity of action, and/or semantic opaqueness as criteria for
saying that a particular verb series is integrated and/or lexicalised. However, these are subjective
judgements concerning gradient attributes, so do not necessarily equate to distinctions that are clearly
encoded in Duna grammar or semantics.

In some serial verb constructions Vlast provides additional aspect-like or directional
meaning as to the way that Vn is done. Three regular verbs that occur in the textual
data as Vlast with aspect-like function are shown in Table 7.4 and exemplified in
(511) - (515).13(511)     na      ima-na          ipa raku           ngi khi-u.

  12
      Durie (1997) notes that it is cross-linguistically common for a verb meaning ‘give’ or similar to
occur in verb serialisation with a valency-increasing function. However, this does not appear to be a
productive feature of Duna, as I have only noted ruwa- occurring in combination with ngua- in this
way.
   13
      These are bivalent verbs, and it may be sensible to interpret them as complement-taking predic-
ates, a clause headed by Vn corresponding to the P argument of Vlast .

away from the deictic centre (typically the speaker).14 This construction relates to
use of the bound derivational morpheme -ku (§7.2.3) which indicates activity done
towards the deictic centre (and may derive from an earlier form of the verb ‘come’).(516)     ki        ndu leka nga-ya...

wa- ‘do, have’ also occur as Vlast in apparent serialisations. In these cases, a [Vn
  14
     Nga- ‘go’ can also be used to indicate continuative aspect in medial clause constructions. How-
ever, I have not observed it occurring with this function in serialisation.
236                                       Chapter 7. Some complex predicate structures
Vlast ] structure in which Vn is an uninflected regular verb root is one manifesta-
tion of a range of constructions in which ka-, era- and wa- occur as complement-
taking predicates, for example expressing causation, result, and achievement (re-
spectively), or functioning as conjunctions (typically when marked with SEQ -ta).
These structures show some formal differences to verb serialisation as described
in this chapter. For example, when ka- ‘be/stand’ occurs as Vlast , a consonantal
Vn will occur in its imperfective stem form rather than its i-base form. As such,
I do not address these constructions in this thesis. Although they may show some
surface similarites to monoclausal verb serialisation, they are more appropriately
considered in the larger context of complex sentences, and are beyond the scope of
the present study.","[259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265]"

          That man is very good (CD/XV:6)4.1.3     Bivalent clauses
Bivalent clauses are headed by a predicate that semantically requires two parti-
cipants. For example the bivalent verb sa- ‘strike, hit, kill’ subcategorises for a
striker and a thing that is struck. The verb encodes an activity that includes an
agent, “a participant which the meaning of the verb describes as doing something,
or causing something to happen” and a patient, “a participant which the verb de-
scribes as having something happen to it, and as being affected by what happens to
it” (Andrews 2007:137). I refer to items that fill the participant slots of a bivalent
clause as ‘A’ and ‘P’ arguments. Typically an A argument has agent-like semantics
and a P argument has patient-like semantics, but this is not always the case. For
example, the verb may specify other kinds of semantic roles such as the theme and
path required by the verb mbite-, ‘cross (a waterway)’; or a bivalent verb may be
used in expressing an involuntary experience in which the A argument is an experi-
encer and the P argument a stimulus (§7.6).
   An A argument can be realised in the clause as an NP, or through zero ana-
phora (§4.2.3.3). An A argument NP is typically either obligatorily marked as a
‘contrasted subject’, or eligible for contrasted subject marking if certain pragmatic
conditions exist (§6.6.1). The identity of an A argument restricts or predicts the
4.1. Clause types                                                                                103
range of bound morphemes that can be applied to the predicate (§11.2). Unlike P
arguments, third person A arguments may typically be referenced by an NP that in-
cludes a free or dependent personal pronoun without any implication of pragmatic
prominence (see sections 5.3.1.1 and 6.6.3).
    A P argument can be realised as an unmarked NP (that is, one that is not overtly
marked for semantic role, grammatical relation, or prominence, see Chapter 6),
an NP marked with -ta ‘LOC’ (§6.3.4.2), or have zero anaphoric reference. A P
argument NP is never marked as a contrasted subject, and its identity does not have
direct bearing on predicate morphology.
    Three examples of bivalent verbal clauses are shown in (53) - (55). In each
case the P argument is realised as an unmarked NP. The A arguments are realised
as either an unmarked NP (example (53)) or an NP that is marked as a contrasted
subject (examples (54) and (55)). In each example the A argument NP precedes the
P argument NP, and this exemplifies typical word order (§4.2.2). (53)    ko ita-na        no-rane...

a LOC-marked nominal phrase. Marking a P argument NP as locative with -ta LOC
typically indicates lower affectedness of the P and lower semantic transitivity (cf.
Hopper and Thompson 1980). Example (56) describes a situation in which only part
of a specific amount of food was eaten, and the locative marker supplies partitive
meaning, that is, only part of the P argument is affected in the carrying out of the
predicated activity.9 The pronominal NP no (1SG) can be interpreted as either an A
argument or a possessor; see §4.2.3.5.","[131, 132]"

    This in turn supports the function of contrasted subject marking as an indicator of pragmatic
prominence, rather than of syntactic structure.

         * Kenny hit Justin and Melo (CD)   Example (443) shows (442) with the CS-marked NP removed. KK judged that
Melone Jetine =kheno could not be interpreted as an object NP, but could easily be
understood as a subject NP in which the object NP was elided, as shown in (443b).
Other speakers made similar judgements concerning other structurally comparable
examples, typically rejecting the use of dependent pronouns in object NPs, and
readily identifying any NP that included a dependent pronoun as a subject argument.(443)    a. Melo-ne Jeti-ne =kheno so
              PSN - PR   PSN - PR =3 DL     strike.PFV
              * [Someone] hit Melo and Justin

              PSN - PR   PSN - PR =3 DL     strike.PFV
              ‘Melo and Justin hit [someone]’    Judgements such as those illustrated in (442) and (443) suggest that dependent
third person pronouns function as nominative (or at least non-accusative) markers.
However, the more highly contextualised data shows that dependent pronouns do
sometimes occur in object NPs. This reference strategy typically coincides with
pragmatic prominence of the NP, in that it represents a highly noteworthy piece of
information.45
    Example (444) shows a constructed sentence in which the inclusion of a de-
pendent pronoun in an object NP was judged acceptable. The hypothetical context
for this example is that the addressee has been hassling the speaker to give them a
particular object; the speaker tersely draws the addressee’s attention to the fact that
she has already given the item to someone else.(444)    na      Nikolo =kho ngu.

         ‘I gave [it] to Nicole.’ (so you won’t be getting it!) (CD/XIV:109)    Example (445) shows an excerpt from a rindi malu narrative. Prior to this ex-
cerpt the main character, an ancestral spirit, has been introduced and his domestic
situation (making a garden, living with his wife and son) has been explained. Line
(445a) details how this spirit has planted certain vegetation; these plants are typ-
ically steambaked with meat in an earth oven, so this information implies that the
spirit is planning some cooking. At line (445b) the speaker reveals the identity of
  45
   Dependent pronouns thus in effect provide a way of marking contrast or emphasis on arguments
where CS-marking is not available for this purpose.

the spirit’s intended meal in a dramatic way; it is his own son that he wants to eat.
The object NP includes a pronoun, as the identity of this argument is particularly
noteworthy. Note also that the verbal predicate is inflected with the verbal morph-
eme -raka, that marks surprising events (§9.3.3.3).(445)   a. ayu lira,       alupa, kerepa-tia hi-ya       ha-ta    ko.

            ‘Living there, this one, [he] wanted to eat the son,...’ (T/RS:270405ia)   NPs that are marked as locative with -ta show similarities to object NPs in that
depedent ponouns are not readily accepted in isolated sentences, but do occur in
contextualised material where the NP is pragmatically prominent.
   Example shows a rejected constructed sentence in which I included a dependent
pronoun in a LOC-marked NP.(446)   a. sirako        ka     Petrusi-ta wana-no.

            * You ask Petrus tomorrow (CD/VIII:79)    Examples (447) and (448) alternatively show more highly contextualised ex-
amples in which LOC-marked NPs include dependent pronouns. These NPs occur
in situations of emphatic or contrastive identification, for example where the speaker
wishes to underline the fact of direct communication with the precise referent of the
NP.(447)   inu-ka Wakili =kho-ta wana ngoae             ruwa-ta...

6.6. NP marking: grammatical relation and prominence                             217
    In sum, the use of third person pronouns constitutes a reference strategy that
is typically associated with animacy and discourse prominence but can, especially
in the case of non-subject participants, additionally indicate pragmatic prominence.
This situation is somewhat parallel to contrasted subject marking, which is formally
associated with a particular grammatical function, but can, especially in the case of
S (as opposed to A) arguments, mark contrastive focus; and also to -nga marking,
which can indicate a structurally relevant feature, reflexivity (a single participant
occupies both the A and P argument slots of a bivalent clause) and/or emphatic
identification.
Chapter 7Some complex predicate structures
7.1   Introduction
Predicates of verbal clauses in Duna often consist of a verb only, in the sense that
a single inflected verb root occurs clause-finally, and denotes ‘what’s going on’,
determining the argument structure of the clause and the semantic roles of the par-
ticipants. Predicates of verbal clauses may also be complex, being “composed of
more than one grammatical morpheme (either morphemes or words) each of which
contributes part of the information ordinarily associated with a head” (Alsina et al.
1997).
    This chapter identifies five major complex predication structures in Duna, sum-
marised in Table 7.1.","[243, 244, 245, 246, 247]"
"(165)     [Phawa roma-na-ka] wa-ya...
          PLN       above-SPEC-CS smile-DEP
          [N        Dem]N P
          ‘The Phawa [mountain] above smiled...’(T/HY:201003iii)     In telling a narrative, sopa ‘below’ can denote an earlier point in the story; events
or things that have already been described are ‘lower’ than the current topic. Thus,
if a speaker has to back-track to an earlier point in a narrative (for example, if they
have forgotten to include an important part of the plot), they will introduce this by
saying they ‘forgot something below’ or similar; see for example (787) in §9.2.5.2.17
The term eto is used in denoting successive time periods. For example, the week
(sarere, from Tok Pisin) following the current week (‘next week’) is referred to as
sarere eto.185.2.5    Co-occurring adjectives, quantifiers, and demonstratives
Adjectives, quantifiers and demonstratives can co-occur in one NP, as represented
in Figure 5.1. More specifically, it is common for adjective NP constituents to be
followed by quantifiers or demonstratives, but unusual for quantifiers and demon-
stratives to occur together.
    Examples (166) and (167) show nominal phrases in which a quantifier follows
an adjective.19
  17
      There is some evidence that roma is conversely used in anticipation of new things to come. For
example the conventional phrase roma ai ‘above who?’ that is used at the beginning of text/melody
blocks in sung pikono typically occurs at the introduction of new characters, whereas sopa ai ‘below
who?’ is used when returning to the activities of old characters who are already known. However
I have not examined whether this correlation holds true in all cases. The pairing of ‘below’ and
‘earlier’ may relate to the fact that in typical traditional stories the hero starts in a low altitude area
and travels into a high altitude area (see Kendoli forthcoming). This may in turn reflect larger themes
in Duna cosmology, as human life itself is described as having begun in the lowlands and moved up
into the higher country (see Haley 2002).
   18
      There is some evidence that eto is also used for linking/temporal ordering in descriptions of
successive events, that is, with a roughly equivalent function to ‘then’ or ‘next’ in English sentences
such as ‘He went to the house, then/next he called his sister’.
   19
      Note that in the case of (167), the meaning of the sentence discourages an interpretation of the
adjective as being part of a smaller unit with the noun that is then modified by the quantifer. That is,
the sentence does not appear to mean ‘eat [many [big choko runners]]’.
5.2. Constituents of noun NPs                                                            145
(166)   Jesika [ita kete yapa] -aka rei.
         PSN         pig small two -COM be/sit.STAT
                     [N A      Q]N P
        ‘Jessica is sitting with two little pigs.’ (ED/III:60)(167)   [ipalu khei         phuka roka] na-no.

        [NPposs N     A            Q]N P
        ‘Eat a great lot of choko runners.’ (ED/XIV:113)    Placing a numerical quantifier before an adjective was judged to be ungrammat-
ical (KK & RA), as shown in (168a).(168)    a. phuti mindu yapa
               cat     black two
               N       A     Q
               ‘two black cats’
         b. * phuti yapa mindu
                 cat     two black
                 N       Q   A
               (CD/2003)    Example (169) shows an adjective and demonstrative in an NP with no overt
notional head. The identity of the referent is clear from the interactional setting, in
which the speaker has just swiped at a mosquito.(169)   [kete ha-na-ka]          na-nda ruwa-ta...
        small there-SPEC-CS eat-INT say-SEQ
        [Adj Dem]N P
        ‘That little [mosquito] wanted to bite me...’ (ED/V:7)    Example (170) shows a situation in which there is no noun preceding an [Ad-
jective Quantifer] sequence and no contextually recoverable notional head. The
phrase kete ndu is modifying the verbal predicate, and does not refer to an entity. It
is an adverbial phrase, not an NP.(170)   hale-ra-tia-ka           kete ndu loko ro-rane          ho-ra-tia       nei-yaka-o
        banana-SHRD-GP-CS small one ripen here-SHRD-GP be/put-SW. SEQ eat-?-voc.
        ‘The bananas ripened a little and she ate these.’ (P/PP:KG05V2.15)    Quantifiers and demonstratives very rarely occur in the same NP.20 The sentence
shown in (171) is the only example I have found in the textual data where the quan-
tifer ndu occurs in combination with a locational demonstrative. In this example
ndu has numerical rather than indefinite meaning.
  20
    Note also that, as outlined in §6.2.1, the occurrence of ndu in combination with epistemic
demonstratives forms a complex epistemic demonstrative, rather than constituting a [Q Dem] se-
quence.

A noun NP can include a phrasal constituent that denotes a possessor-like entity
(XPposs ). This may be a nominal phrase or a postpositional phrase formed with
the NP postposition -ya ‘BEN’ (§6.5.4). The nature of the ‘possessive’ relationship
may differ somewhat according to the animacy and individuation of the possessor.
The positioning of a possessor NP before the possessed item is a typical word order
pattern in verb-final languages (Dryer 2007b).","[173, 174, 175]"
"Reiterated or returning activity   The form -ria- (AGAIN) indicates that the verbal
activity is done again, typically in an opposite way or direction to previously. Ex-
amples are shown in (460) and (461).(460)   ayu imanoa ho ko-ra-tia               pi   hoei-ria-ya,    hi   itiki

        ‘One time the people arrived again it is said.’ (T/YS:270205)     In (462a), -ria- AGAIN, -ku- EXHAUST and the causative morpheme -wae (§7.2.4)
occur in combination with each other on a single verb. The ordering of the two mod-
ifiers -ria- and -ku- is not fixed, and changing the order does not alter the meaning
of the sentence, as shown in (462b).(462)    a. nei-ria-ku-wae-pa.

         b. nei-ku-ria-wae-pa.
              eat-EXHAUST-AGAIN-CAUS-IMP
              ‘Let him eat again and finish it all.’ (CD/XIV69)    The morpheme -ria is transparently related to the verb riya- ‘return’, but I treat
it as a distinct morpheme (that is, rather than Vlast in aspect-modifying serialisa-
tion, see §7.3.3.4) as it shows some structural differences to a verb in series and is

typically phonologically distinct from the free verb. Examples (463a) and (463b)
demonstrate that -ria- has a different status to the aspectual verb yoko- ‘stretch’
(§7.3.3.4). In (463a), -ria- attaches to the serialised verb root yoko-. Reversing
the order of these forms as in (463b) is not acceptable, showing that they are not
structurally equivalent (cf. the free ordering of -ria and -ku as shown in (462)).(463)     a. ngei yoko-ria-nda.

              Go all the way back again (CD)
‘Towards speaker’ -ku-    The bound morpheme -ku- indicates that the activity of the
predicate is carried out toward the speaker (or another entity, generally human or
high animacy, that is identified as a deictic centre).4 Two examples are shown in
(464) and (465).(464)    yõ-ku-pa.

         ‘Push [it] towards me.’ (CED/VIII:1118)(465)    soko-ta      ndu hoei-ku-tia-na.

         ‘Someone came toward them on the bridge.’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).3)   It is notable that this morpheme is segmentally similar in shape to the suppletive
imperative of ‘come’ (§8.2.4.1).","[251, 252]"
"6.6     NP marking: grammatical relation and prominence
6.6.1    Contrasted subject (CS) marking
A subject NP (§4.2.1) can be formally marked as a ‘contrasted subject’ (CS). There
are two main situations in which it is necessary or appropriate to mark the subject
of a clause as contrasted. One is when there is a need to distinguish the subject NP
from other clausal participants. This situation typically arises in clauses headed by
multivalent predicates, the A argument (usually with an actor semantic role) being
overtly distinguished from other predicated arguments (P, R, T, see §4.2.1); this
use of contrasted subject marking functionally resembles ergative case marking.
Another such situation is when there is a need to distinguish an NP referent from
other referents, for example when the identity of the subject is new, unexpected,
and/or contrasted with the identity of another expected or potential subject; this
latter use resembles focus-marking.35
     Singular and dual personal pronouns have special contrasted subject forms, first
listed in §3.2.3 and reproduced here in Table 6.6. Other NPs are marked as contras-
ted with the postposed bound form -ka. 36
    In regard to the singular and dual pronouns, there is a regular relationship between
the non-CS and CS forms in that the final vowel o in the non-CS form changes to
  35
      Duna thus provides another example of a TNG language in which particular marking of an
NP matches ergative distribution to some extent, but cannot be adequately described on a syntactic
basis. See for example Renck (1975), Foley (1986), Scott (1986), Donohue and Donohue (1997),
Donohue (2005), Rumsey (MS), Priestley (2008). As is also fairly common in Papuan languages
(as elsewhere), the ergative-like marker in Duna is homophonous with a morpheme that marks an
instrument-like role.
   36
      I view contrasted subject marking as NP-internal as it can be expressed by stem alternation
rather than the application of a postposed clitic. However, the CS marker is not a kind of NP marker
as it does not attach directly to a spatial or Class I epistemic demonstratives, and commonly occurs
in combination with -na SPEC. In these two ways the CS marker resembles an NP postposition.

forms, there is also a regular tonal difference in that (pronounced in isolation) non-
CS forms no and ko have a ‘Fall’ contour and CS forms na and ka have a ‘Convex’
contour (§2.2.2). First and third person pronouns fluctuate as to whether contrasted
subject marking consists of a stem change only, or a stem change in combination
with the regular CS marker -ka. For example, in reference to a first person dual
contrasted subject the forms kena and kenaka are both used.37
    In its ‘actor-distinguishing’ capacity, CS-marking typically occurs on: subject
NPs of multivalent clauses with an animate or highly individuated object (one of
the features typically associated with high semantic transitivity, cf. Hopper and
Thompson (1980)); and on low animacy subjects of any multivalent predicate.
    Examples (409) - (414) show clauses headed by the verb sa- ‘hit, kill’, a Duna
primary transitive verb (Andrews 1985). In elicitation, CS-marking is judged to
be obligatory on the subject NP of this verb, as shown by the ungrammaticality of
(412) and (413). If no other NP occurs in a clause headed by sa-, an NP that is not
CS -marked will be interpreted as an object argument, as shown in (414).38 Overtly
marking the subject NP can thus be crucial to identifying a referent as A (an actor),
not P (an undergoer).(409)    noni-na-ka          ndulu iwani-na so.

         ‘A dog killed and ate a possum...’(T/HY:201003i)
  37
     Marking through stem alternation only appears to be more common. In a sample of 29 CS-
marked first person dual pronouns in the textual data, there are nineteen tokens of kena and ten of
kenaka.
  38
     Note, however, that in the case of third person subjects, use of a dependent pronoun (§6.6.3)
may alternatively be sufficient to indicate subjecthood.

        ‘[Someone] hit me.’ (CD)    With some bivalent predicates, for example the verb na- ‘eat, consume’, relative
animacy may be sufficient to identify the A participant, and CS-marking is typically
only used if the subject is low animacy (non-human). This is the same pattern as for
‘optional nominative case’ marking in Fore as analysed by Donohue and Donohue
(1997), following on from Scott’s description of the Fore ‘delineator’ morpheme
(Scott 1978 1986). The pattern is exemplified in (415) - (418). In (415) and (416),
the subject of the verbs na- ‘eat’ and sa- ‘take’ is highly animate (being first per-
son) and CS-marking is not used. These are typical ‘direct’ scenarios, in which
the roles of the participants can be correctly predicted from their relative animacy
(high/human = actor, low/non-human = undergoer).(415)   no ita na-ya-roko...

are low animacy (non-human), the scenarios are not direct, and CS-marking is re-
quired on the subject NP. Note, however, that it may not be strictly obligatory if the
identity of the A participant is already sufficiently established. In (419), only the
first iteration of the subject NP is CS-marked, as in the second iteration the identity
of the subject is assumed and does not need to be overtly contrasted.(417)   yawiputi-ka uru na-na.

         ‘If the dog eats the rat, the dog will eat chickens.’ (ED LSRV:99)    In clauses with monovalent predicates, CS-marking is less common than for sub-
jects of bivalent predicates, but is robustly attested in the textual data. CS-marking
in these cases typically indicates that the identity of the subject is new, unexpec-
ted, and/or contrasted with the identity of another expected or potential subject.
The subject is in ‘contrastive focus’ (Dik 1989). This again maps to functions of
the Fore nominative marker, which can also mark contrastive focus (Donohue and
Donohue 1997:85).
    In examples (420) and (421), the subject argument of nga- ‘go’ is marked with
-ka. Example (420) is taken from a point in a text just after the activities of a certain
dog have been descibed. The story now turns to the activities of another dog, which
is marked at first reference with -ka.39(420)    yawi-na-ka ndulu nga-ta...

         ‘One time another dog went...’(T/HY:201003i)    Example (421) is taken from a text in which a duck has just tried unsuccessfully
to retrieve a magic object that has been stolen. The duck’s companion (a cat) now
asserts that (?s)he will make a second attempt to get it back.(421)    na      ngui-na         ri-tia         ri-na.

         ‘Now I am going [he] said it is said’ (T/PK:080605ii)   Contrastive focus is also suggested by RA and KK’s assessment of suitable cir-
cumstances for the constructed sentence shown in (422), in which the subject ar-
gument of a monovalent complex predicate (§7.5.2) is CS-marked. RA and KK
thought that this sentence could occur as an answer to a father’s question to his
daughters, ‘Which one of you girls will marry?’.(422)    na      anoa nga-nda.
         1SG.CS man go-INT
         ‘I (out of all of us) will marry.’ (CD/XIV:113)    The major functions of CS-marking (identifying actors and marking contrast-
ive focus) are not mutually exclusive, and it is not always possible to distinguish
between them. For example in (423), the fact that the three dream women (ima

    Note this dog is also marked as specific with -na despite being a new character, apparently
supplying contrastive identity implication; see discussion at various points in §6.3.

itupa) are CS-marked may indicate that they are contrasted both as new subject
referents, and as effective actors, because their actions have a direct (and adverse)
effect on a human entity, the speaker. In (424), a human subject of na- ‘eat’ is CS-
marked. This may be motivated by the fact that the object is as highly animate as
the subject, as well as contrastively focussing the subject and distinguishing it from
the other third person plural referent that has just been described.(423)    hindeke-roko, ima          itupa-ka hoa-ta         no sia         ho-yaki ra-ya,

textual data) in which a subject NP is marked as contrasted. Both of these examples
describe the growth of cultivars, and are excerpts from stories in which the main
human character is incompetent at growing food and is helped in this task by a
supernatural creature who secretly plants crops for the human to harvest. In these
examples the use of contrasted subject marking perhaps highlights the fact that these
cultivars appear to grow ‘by themselves’ rather than being planted and tended by
humans in the usual way.40 The particular bananas and sweet potato runners referred
to in the story are special and contrast with ‘typical’ plants.(425)    hale     -ra-tia-ka     kete ndu loko rorane...

     Interestingly, description of vegetable growth is also identified by Donohue and Donohue
(1997:78-9) as a situation in which the Fore nominative marker occurs on inanimate subjects of
monovalent clauses. However, Donohue and Donohue further argue that in the Fore case the relev-
ant predicating verbs are ambivalent, and that nominative marking makes explicit the fact the plants
are subjects of monovalent clauses, rather than objects of bivalent clauses. This does not exactly par-
allel the Duna case, as (from the currently available data) the predicating verbs in (425) and (426d)
only ever head monovalent clauses.

ations where a human subject argument is an involuntary experiencer rather than an
agent. For example, RA thought that using a CS pronoun with the monovalent verb
khou- ‘feel pain’ as in (427) was unusual and ‘not very sensible’. However, he sug-
gested that the sentence shown in (428) could be used by a sulky young person in
unrepentant sarcastic response to a parent who has been telling them off. Although
this ‘feels right’, I find it difficult to explicitly identify how the contrasted subject
marking contributes to the sarcastic or scornful nature of the sentence; perhaps it
asserts the speaker as someone who is ‘in control’ of the situation, even though the
semantics of the verb suggest otherwise.(427)   ? na      khou-yarua

"1.4    Thesis overview
This thesis describes certain structures of Duna grammar that are used in building
simple sentences, and looks in detail at some semantic themes that are encoded in
the bound morphemes of the language, particularly those that are to do with ex-
pressing attitudes to knowledge. It is an introduction to the language, and does not
present a comprehensive inventory of Duna grammatical morphemes and opera-
tions, or deal with complex sentence structures (for example, those involving clause
embedding or coordination).
    Chapter 2 provides an overview of Duna phonology, including a description of
the phonemic inventory and the major allophones of these phonemes, and a prelim-
inary statement concerning lexical tone in monomorphemic words. In Chapter 3, I
define Duna word classes as referred to in this thesis, and list the known members
of small closed classes. Chapter 4 presents an overview of major clause types and
features of basic clause structure.
    In Chapters 5 and 6, I examine the structure of nouns, nominal phrases (NPs),
place phrases (PlcPs), and postpositional phrases (PP), constituents that typically
occur to represent participants in the clause. This includes an account of morpholo-
1.4. Thesis overview                                                                27
gically complex nouns and the lexical structure of NPs (Ch. 5), and itemisation and
illustration of bound morphemes that indicate the epistemic positioning, number,
definiteness, grammatical function, semantic role, and/or prominence of the phrase
to which they are added (Ch. 6).
    In Chapters 7 to 11, I look in more detail at predicating constituents. Chapter
7 provides examples and discussion of certain complex predicate constructions, in-
cluding complex verbs, serialised verbs, and predicates that are composed of a verb
in combination with a free lexeme such as a noun or adjective.
    Chapter 8 begins my exploration of bound forms that occur on ‘final’ predicates.
Final predicates head an independent clause that constitutes a complete sentence
in itself, or occurs last in a chain of dependent clauses. Chapter 8 is concerned
with inflectional forms that occur on verbs, and indicate time, event modality, and
polarity features of the predicated activity, for example whether it is complete or
ongoing, or whether the speaker desires it to occur.
    In Chapter 9 I describe two groups of bound forms (evidential and information
status markers) that a speaker can use as final verb inflections to supply an epistemic
assessment of the proposition that is encoded in the utterance, as well as to supply
temporal information. Evidential markers typically indicate a source of information
(for example, whether the predicated activity was seen to occur), and information
status markers encode other kinds of attitudes towards the proposition (for example
as knowledge that is new or familiar).
    In Chapter 10, I illustrate complex final morphology constructions in which
evidential and information status markers are added following inflected verb forms
rather than bare roots, discuss the use of these forms in non-verbal clauses, and
introduce some further bound forms and constructions that are concerned in the
expression of epistemic assessment.
    Chapter 11 examines final predicate markers as described in Chapters 8 to 10
with respect to the sentence types of Duna, focussing on the way that certain forms
make different predictions about the relationship of the speaker to the proposition
in interrogative as opposed to non-interrogative sentences. In this last chapter I also
provide an overview of epistemic assessment and the final predicate in Duna.
Chapter 2Phonology
This chapter itemises the segmental phonemes of Duna and their major allophones,
and outlines some generalised phonological processes (§2.1). In §2.2 I describe
some aspects of contrastive lexical pitch, and §2.3 provides a key to the orthography
used in this thesis.","[55, 56, 57]"

  16
     Note also that the use of the prophetic inflection in questions generally signifies ‘diffusion’ of
information access, suggesting that the addressee does not necessarily know more about the ques-
tioned proposition than the speaker does; see §11.2.3.3. However, by further marking the prophetic
inflection with the sensory evidential, which does locate a particular informant, the questioners in
(931) manage to employ the most apposite future-time verbal inflection (that is, the prophetic inflec-
tion), whilst still maintaining the prophet’s ‘privileged access’ to knowledge of future events.

          ‘The dog ate the chicken {you saw} apparently, well your behaviour is just

information following a finite verb form in the same way that evidentials can, sug-
gesting that markers of epistemic assessment can in general be ‘stacked’ in any
logically tenable order. The context surrounding (933), the apparent ungrammatic-
ality of (932), and the general rarity of this structure in the data suggests that this
particular construction is pragmatically highly marked and is used to cast doubt
on another’s veracity, rather than for the speaker to express doubt about their own
experience. However, this hypothesis requires further investigation.","[413, 414]"
"8.2.3.6    Special present form of nga- ‘go’
There is a further special final form (ngui) of the verb nga- ‘go’. This form is used
in regard to ‘going’ that is contemporaneous with the time of utterance (present
time), and only occurs with informant subjects. An exchange such as that shown in
(678) is typical of interactions between two people who meet on a path.(678)     a. Q: ko pa-na           ngui=pe.
                  2SG query-SPEC go.PRES=Q

          3SG goPRES
          He is going (CD/2003)    This form of nga- ‘go’ does not fit neatly into any other inflectional category,
although it shows some relation to the stative inflection (§8.2.3.1) in that it includes
the segment /i/ and is used in regard to a present activity. However ‘going’ is typ-
ically a progressive rather than stative action, so identifying this as a special ‘STAT’
inflection does not really seem appropriate. I gloss this form as ‘PRES’ for ‘present
time’, which at least describes one major facet of its meaning.
290           Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
8.2.3.7    Comment on aspectual oppositions
Comrie (1976) proposes a general classification of aspectual oppositions as shown
in Figure 8.2. The first order distinction is whether an event is viewed ‘from the
outside’ as a whole (perfective), or from the inside, as something that has distinct
internal temporal structure (imperfective). Within the super-ordinate category of
imperfective, the habitual is contrasted with the continuous. Comrie defines the
habitual positively, as having to do with situations that are “characteristic of an ex-
tended period of time, so extended in fact that the situation referred to is viewed not
as an incidental property of the moment but, precisely, as a characteristic feature
of the whole period” (1976:28). Continuity is defined negatively, as imperfectiv-
ity that is not habituality (1976:26). Continuity can be further distinguished as to
whether or not the internal temporal structure of the event is progressive (dynamic,
changing, accomplishing) or non-progressive (unchanging, non-accomplishing).","[318, 319]"
"9.2.4     Sensory evidential markers
9.2.4.1    Introduction
Sensory evidence morphemes typically indicate that the informant’s evidence for
the proposition is direct but not visual. This includes information sources that are
perceived through the senses of hearing, smell, taste, and touch, as well as other
physical or emotional sensations (for example, temperature, fear). They may also
mark predications that are surmised or prophetically envisioned by the informant.17
The predicate is understood to have the same time reference in relation to the time
of utterance as the perception of the evidence. That is, predicates specified as hav-
ing current evidence are understood to be happening at the time of utterance, and
predicates specified as having previous evidence are understood to have occurred
prior to the time of utterance.
    In terms of attested cross-linguistic evidential categories, this Duna category
can be compared to to the ‘Auditory’ and ‘Other sensory’ categories as discussed
  16
      In this case it does not seem correct to say that the verb has stative sense. Rather, the visual
evidence category is chosen in order to signify maximally direct observation of the event, and the
further choice between perfective and stative aspectual specification is made on a ‘best-fit’ basis.
See also (779).
   17
      Of all of these possibilities, the primary meaning is generally recognised as having to do with
auditory evidence. For example KK and RA suggested that the Duna verb which most suitably
describes the context for these morphemes is waki- ‘hear, listen’. (In my experience this verb, unlike
more general ‘perceive’ predicates such as the Tok Pisin ‘harim’, is not commonly used for any act
of perception other than aural perception.)

by Willett (1988) and the ‘non-visual sensory’ category discussed by Aikhenvald
(2004).","[347, 348]"
"9.3.2.3    Overview of the expression of present time events
We have now looked at the full range of known Duna morphemes that can occur as
primary inflections on final verbs in the expression of (non-habitual) present time
events, first introduced in Table 8.3 and reproduced here as Table 9.6.46 The group
includes three TAM forms (one of which is applicable to wa-class and consonantal
verbs only), four visual and non-visual sensory evidential markers, the individual
standpoint information status marker -pa, and specificity marker -na (the last two
being applicable only to regular verbs). The morphemes are formally and semantic-
ally disparate, but also functionally contrastive, and can be though of as providing
a speaker with a finite set of choices in regard to the (maximally simple) expression
of a situation that holds at the time of utterance.
  45
      For example, in detailing the functions of nominalising morphology in Bodic languages (a pos-
tulated genetic grouping within Tibeto-Burman), Noonan (2008) notes that: “when nominalizations
[i.e., constructions headed by nominalisations or forms morpholgically identical to them] appear as
main clauses, the typical effect is one of mirativity, i.e. the sense that the predication so expressed
is in some sense surprising, contrary to expectation, or in some way exasperating”. In discussing
Kiranti languages (Tibeto-Burman), Bickel (1999) argues that the use of nominalisation markers on
non-embedded clauses represents a focus construction. Such constructions may be used in Belhare,
for example: “to instantiate a controversial discourse variable” (for example, in an utterance that
emphatically rejects a suggestion or insinuation made by an interlocutor); in the instantiation of an
open variable (completive focus) where “a speaker claims her proposition to be the definite answer
to the question”; or to re-instantiate a variable in narrative in order to “ascertain that the audience is
fully aware of the proposition and does not doubt it any further” (Bickel 1999).
   46
      The special present form of nga- ‘go’ (ngui) is not included in the array, as it is only applicable
to one verb. However, in relation to later discussion in this section, the fact that this inflection only
occurs in sentences with volitional informant subjects means there is a good argument to be made
that it encodes participatory semantics.

    Figure 9.1 shows one way that these forms can be arranged as a system of in-
flectional options, albeit one that draws its components from diverse sources (des-
ignations in parentheses are explained and discussed subsequently).
    As a first choice, a verb that denotes a present-time event can be inflected with a
form that makes reference to unseen information source (a SNS category evidential
marker) or one that does not. If a SNS marker is selected, a further distinction
between personal and impersonal evidence (§9.2.2.2) is possible. Otherwise, further
selection is made between other TAM, evidential, and information status markers.
    If the event described is a state, this can be expressed as something that was
visually witnessed prior to the time of utterance, in which case the choice between
personal and impersonal evidence is again brought into play. Otherwise, the stative
TAM marker can be used (§8.2.3.1). If the event is non-stative, it becomes import-
ant to identify the class of the verb that denotes this event. If the verb is regular, it
may be marked as representing individual knowledge (§9.3.2.1), or as expressing a
situation that is specific and noteworthy. Typically this is something that the speaker
thinks can or should be immediately observed by the interlocutor (§9.3.2.2). Altern-
atively, if the verb is a member of the consonantal or wa-class verbs, it is simply
marked as denoting an imperfective event through use of the imperfective stem
(§8.2.2.2).

    In addressing the status of the ‘other’ designations within Figure 9.1, the pos-
sibility of treating information source as an obligatorily expressed domain in verbal
inflection becomes relevant, as discussed with respect to past time events in §9.2.9.
The choice between SNS markers and other forms can be expressed as a selec-
tion between two kinds of information source: that which is ‘firsthand’, compris-
ing visuo-perceptive, participatory, and factual information source; and that which
is ‘non-firsthand’, comprising non-visuo-perception, and being extended to certain
kinds of inference concerning ongoing events (as illustrated in (769) in §9.2.4.2).47
Under the ‘stative’ node the distinction can again be characterised as one that is
entirely to do with information source, ‘visual’ versus ‘participatory/factual’.
    Under this reading, inflectional options that relate to present-time situations
comprise a functional paradigm within which evidentiality is an obligatory gram-
matical category: a speaker has a finite set of morphological options, all of which
encode information source. As for the perfective inflection, whether or not TAM
markers such as a the stative and imperfective inflections do indeed encode inform-
ation source is something of a moot point, and further data are needed to examine
this issue. There is some evidence to support the view that these forms are ‘pos-
itively’ evidential (for example, the fact that they can, like evidential markers, be
followed by -na SPEC, see §10.2) and some evidence against it (for example, the
fact that IPFV can occur in combination with evidential markers, and that the stative
inflection can be followed by epistemic particles).
    Regardless of whether or not these forms are identified as necessarily evidential
morphemes, it can be seen that the parameter of information source (like that of
aspect as outlined in §8.2.3.7) has quite a profound effect concerning the possible
articulation of possible primary inflections as a system or group of subsystems, and
is a particularly important factor within the inflectional inventory.","[375, 376, 377, 378]"
"6.6.3   Dependent third person pronouns
Proper name or common noun nominal phrases that denote third person parties can
include a postposed coreferent third person pronoun, as in (436). Typically a third
212                                              Chapter 6. NP, PP, and PlcP morphology
person pronoun that occurs in this position is encliticised, that is, it shows some level
of phonological dependency. It may be very short and fit into the intonation contour
of the nominal phrase rather than sounding like a separate word, and there may
also be loss of segmental content. For example, I have heard third person singular
pronouns in this position realised as nothing more than a brief phrase-final [O]. I
refer to a pronoun that occurs in this position, with no pause intervening between it
and the otherwise final NP constituent, as a dependent pronoun, and represent such
forms with a preceding ‘=’ in example sentences.41(436)    no ame-tia         =khunu ha-me           wa-ya ka-na.
         1SG ancestor-GP =3PL          there-MNR do-DEP be/stand-HAB
         ‘My ancestors would live doing thus.’ (T/RS:270405a)    Free third person pronouns typically reference participants that are animate, def-
inite, and discourse prominent, and are associated with the grammatical relation
subject (§5.3.1.1). This is also true of the use of dependent pronominal forms.42 De-
pendent pronouns occur frequently in subject NPs, but the inclusion of a dependent
pronoun in an object or oblique NP is unusual and indicates pragmatic prominence.
    The importance of current discourse prominence to dependent pronoun use is
illustrated in the contrast between the referential treatment of the two human par-
ticipants Layapi and Wakili in lines (437d) and (438b) of text excerpts (437) and
(438), respectively. In both of these excerpts the speaker (KK) describes a roughly
similar sequence of events, the death of a person and the happenings that surround
this.
    Excerpt (437) is taken from towards the end of a narrative which describes an
attack on an old man named Layapi by a mysterious supernatural force. At (437a),
Layapi is a participant with high topic continuity and is covertly referenced through
zero anaphora. However, from (437b) onwards Layapi starts to ‘drop out’ of the
text. When we get to (437d), in which Layapi’s death is described, Layapi is no
  41
      In cases where a non-prononimal NP and a third person pronoun are coreferential and contigu-
ous but there is a pause or clear intonation discontinuity between the two constituents, I analyse
these as separate NPs, not a dependent pronoun construction. Such an example may alternatively be:
a left dislocation construction, §4.2.4.3; an ‘umbrella’ pronoun that follows a listing construction,
see §5.4.1; or two adpositional NPs that occur at points of disjuncture, periphrastic expansion, or
repetition, for example when a speaker hesisates mid-clause and then repeats or corrects themselves.
However, it must be added that as my judgment of whether or not discontinuous intonation is present
is subjective, the decision between whether a ‘NP Pronoun’ string counts as left dislocation or a de-
pendent pronoun construction is somewhat arbitrary. I do not regard this as highly problematic in
my description as the functions of the two constructions are highly compatible, and I further believe
that ambiguity between them reflects a genuinely continuous relationship between the construction
types.
   42
      An examination of 47 third person pronouns as they occurred in three short texts suggested that
free and dependent pronouns occur with roughly equal frequency in narrative material; there were
23 free pronouns and 24 dependent forms.

longer a discourse prominent participant; the text turns to the current speaker him-
self, and the way that he came to learn the story that he has just related. At his final
mention in (437d), Layapi is referenced by a plain NP, Layapi.(437)     a. ke-nda ruwa-ta imanoa hiwa-ya eto-ta                 nga-ya-roko, khene

phora as Kenny describes her being transferred to the school building at line (438a).
However, unlike Layapi, Wakili remains a highly discourse prominent participant
throughout the following lines, and is referenced with an NP that includes a depend-
ent pronoun in (438b). Her death is an event central to the text that the listener is
asked to pay attention to and envision for themselves.(438)     a. akura si       hoa-ta,     sopa sukulanda-ta           ra-roko,

     From discussion with KK it does not appear that this single-verb clause includes an identifiable
‘participant’ as such, but is more of a narrator’s comment external to the story. The subject argument
is in a sense the situation that KK has just described.

and discourse prominent participants, the use of dependent pronouns can bear the
burden of ‘subject identification’ to some extent.44 Example (439) shows a clause
with high semantic transitivity in which the object and subject arguments are equally
animate. The subject argument is referenced with an NP that includes a dependent
pronoun. This example shows a situation in which CS-marking of the A argument
NP would be preferred (if not obligatory) in less contextualised utterances (for ex-
ample, constructed sentences or ‘bare’ elicited data for which context has not been
imaginatively developed or imported from a real-life situation).(439)    e    anene =kheno ho-na           neya ka-ya           ra-na.

         (T/YS:KG05V7.22)    Example (440) shows a textual excerpt in which the third person subject of
ngua- ‘give’ is referenced by an NP that includes an unmarked dependent pronoun;
in bare elication contexts, subject NPs in clauses headed by this verb were consist-
ently CS-marked.(440)    nane-na =kho imanoa -ra-tia            hatia kondarake ngi-ya...

         ‘The boy gave these people the road contract...’ (T/PK:080605ii)    The association of dependent pronouns with the subject argument of a clause is
further illustrated by the constructed examples shown in (441) and (442). Example
(441) shows an acceptable sentence, in which the subject NP, Kenika is CS-marked
and the object NP, Melone Jetine, is unmarked. Example (442) shows the same
sentence with the dual third person pronoun kheno included as a dependent form in
the object NP; KK rejected this as nonsensical.","[240, 241, 242, 243]"

the same participant occupies the same argument position (S, A, or P) in the follow-
ing clause. There is only one occasion (clause (b)) in which an opportunity for zero
anaphora based on this principle is not taken.20 From impressionistic observation,
this is fairly typical of narrative text. However, it is by no means a requirement that
a participant be both referenced in a preceding clause and maintain an unchanged
argument position in order to be elided. This is seen in a further excerpt from the
same text, shown in (86). The speaker (on being questioned) is talking in more de-
tail about the way the snake was caught—an event that was referred to in a single
clause (85h) earlier in the text. At this point the speaker and the addressee (LSR) are
walking around the site that this event took place, so gesture and real-world location
play a significant part in the explanation of what happened.",[144]

    TAM markers encode features of the predicated event in relation to time and
event modality. Time features include those that are related to the category of as-
pect (“the internal temporal constituency of a situation”, Comrie (1976:3)) and to
the category of tense (relating the time of the event with respect to the time of utter-
ance.6 ‘Event modality’ is defined by Palmer (2001:8) as the modal category which
refers to “events that are not actualised, events that have not taken place but are
merely potential”.7 Inflections that encode event modality meanings are concerned
in expressing an attitude towards the actualisation of a potential event; for example,
saying that it can or should (or shouldn’t) take place. Palmer divides event modal-
ity into two main types, the ‘dynamic’ and ‘deontic’. Dynamic mode is typically
concerned with ‘internal’ properties (generally properties of the subject) such as
ability and intention, and deontic mode is more to do with ‘external’ conditioning
factors such as obligation and permission (Palmer 2001:9). This distinction relates
somewhat to the division of ‘participant-internal modality’ and ‘participant-external
   6
      Some of the inflections have additional meanings and functions that are relevant to broader topic
of ‘epistemic assessment’, discussed in the following three chapters. These meanings are stated here,
but discussion of them is kept to a minimum until the relevant features have been presented in more
detail with regard to other predicate morphology.
    7
      Palmer contrasts event modality with propositional modality, which is to some extent the do-
main of the Duna bound morphemes described in Chapters 9 and 10.
278            Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
modality’ proposed by van der Auwera and Plungian (1998).8
    Semi-finite inflections (§8.2.2), comprise a set of four morphological operations,
two of which encode aspect values and two of which encode event modality values.
These can occur as the only inflection of an independent clause, or derive stems that
can be combined with ancillary predicate morphology, including evidential markers,
information status markers, and epistemic particles; see Chapter 10.9
    Sections 8.2.3 and 8.2.4 describe finite final verb inflections, those that derive
a bounded proposition in terms of actualisation, temporal features, and/or the il-
locutionary force of the utterance, marking “structural independence at the highest
possible level of sentencehood” (Bisang 2007:137). Section 8.2.3 details inflections
that occur in declarative (or, by extension, interrogative) sentences. Two of these
inflections, the habitual and stative, are used in reference to an actual situation, and
mark time features of these situations. The other three inflections are used in ref-
erence to non-actual events. These have quite specific or complex meanings, for
example the promissive inflection -wei indicates that the speaker makes a promise
or accepts an obligation regarding a future action. At least some finite declarat-
ive inflections can be used in limited combination with certain ancillary markers,
although this is uncommon (§10.2.3.3).
    In §8.2.4 I describe a group of final verb markers that occur in non-declarative
sentences (marking imperative, optative, and some other minor sentence types, see
§11.1). Some of these are not strictly inflectional forms as they are constructional, or
are added to derived verb stems rather than bare root forms; I include such markers
in this section on functional/semantic grounds. The markers described in §8.2.4
usually occur in directive speech acts (for example, commands, prohibitions) where
the speaker tries to get other people to do (or not do) things. The core meanings
of these forms are deontic, expressing “the imposition of an expressed world on
a reference world” (Frawley 1992:420).10 Time reference (immediate or deferred
time, see §8.2.4.6) is also either encoded or implied as part of their meaning. Finite
non-declarative TAM markers do not occur in combination with ancillary markers
   8
      The match is not exact. For one thing, the essential definition of modality in van der Auwera
and Plungian (1998) concerns the opposition of necessity and possibility; thus, participant-internal
modality has to do with internal possibility (for example, ability) or internal necessity (need), and
does not incorporate intention. Additionally, participant-external modality is treated as a domain
that contains deontic modality, rather than as a way to define it. However, van der Auwera and
Plungian’s and Palmer’s ‘deontic’ categories do end up being roughly equivalent, as under both
models the major concerns of deontic modality are obligation (deontic necessity) and permission
(deontic possibility).

      I call these inflections semi-finite because they do not necessarily determine temporal and actu-
alisation features of the predicated event in absolute terms; if they are followed by an ancillary, their
meanings are typically construed as relative to the ancillary, rather than independently.
   10
      We can say that in contrast to this, markers that are typically used in statements are concerned
in the exposition of the reference world as an expressed world.
8.2. Tense, aspect and event modality (TAM)                                              279
and are thus ‘terminal’ inflections.
    TAM markers can be grouped together in a number of alternative ways which
cut across the three groups as presented in §8.2.2 - §8.2.4. Different semantic, func-
tional, and formal features of the morphemes compel different articulations of how
they relate to each other. For example, it makes sense to identify TAM markers
that are used in the description of actualised rather than potential events as a dis-
crete group that encodes aspect as the primary organisational parameter, and this is
outlined in §8.2.3.7.
    Duna verbs are not marked with pronominal agreement affixes,11 and TAM
markers do not mark person as such (that is, they do not alternate strictly according
to the number and person of certain clausal arguments). However, certain (declarat-
ive) TAM markers have a distributional pattern that correlates with subject identity,
and this pattern generally follows ‘conjunct/disjunct’ alignment (§11.2.1.1). The
Duna intentive inflection (§8.2.2.3), promissive inflection (§8.2.3.5), and the special
present inflection of the verb nga- ‘go’ (§8.2.3.6) typically occur with speaker sub-
jects in declarative sentences and addressee subjects in questions (show conjunct
distribution). The prophetic inflection (§8.2.3.3) typically occurs with non-speaker
subjects in declarative sentences and non-addressee subjects in interrogative sen-
tences (shows disjunct distribution).
    The conjunct/disjunct pattern is generally concerned with the relationship between
a participant (most commonly S or A) of a verbal clause and the person in the ut-
terance situation who is the epistemic source (Hargreaves 2005) with regard to the
proposition. For example, it is typically sensitive to whether the person in the speech
situation who has (best access to) knowledge of the described event also figures as
an agentive participant in it. The nature and implications of this distributional pat-
tern in Duna are discussed in more detail in Chapter 11. For the time-being I focus
in the main on the basic meanings of these TAM markers in declarative sentences,
although a few interrogative examples are also introduced.
    Because of the significance of the conjunct/disjunct distributional pattern to
Duna grammar, it is useful to have a quasi-‘person’ term (additional to and cut-
ting across the grammatical categories of first, second, and third person encoded in
the Duna personal pronouns) that refers to the speaker of a declarative sentence, and
the addressee of an interrogative sentence. I use the term ‘informant’ for this kind
of person, following Bickel (2001) (as reported in Bickel and Nichols 2007). Note,
however, that my use of the term informant is not identical to that of Bickel, who
defines informant functionally as “the person whom the speaker supposes or claims  11
   Foley (2000:377) notes that a lack of such affixes is “relatively uncommon” in languages of
New Guinea.
280            Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
to be the immediate supplier of the information” (Bickel and Nichols 2007:223), and
with respect to different kinds of speech acts (that is, the informant is the speaker
in statements, the addressee in questions, Bickel 2007:2). My definition is tied to
formal sentence types of Duna (at this stage, declarative and interrogative) rather
than being completely functional.
    One other obvious way in which subject identity is relevant to verbal inflection
is in the context of directive inflections. For example, verbs that are inflected as
imperative have an addressee subject by pragmatic necessity. Imperative sentences
usually occur as commands, and the imperative inflection is not used in interrogative
sentences, so a conjunct/disjunct pattern is not observable. However, the desider-
ative (§8.2.2.4), prohibitive (§8.2.4.2), and hortative (§8.2.4.3) inflections occur in
optative sentences (§11.1), which can be transformed into interrogatives (for ex-
ample, with the addition of the interrogative marker =pe, §11.1.3.2). In these cases
we again see an alternation in correlations concerning subject identity that are de-
pendent on sentence type, with the markers generally showing disjunct-like distri-
bution. This is illustrated in §11.2.4; in this chapter I only discuss the use of these
markers in directive utterances and do not exemplify their use in questions.","[306, 307, 308, 309]"

8.1.1.2   Primary inflections and the final verb
Bound morphemes that can occur as primary inflections on final verbs are listed in
Tables 8.2 - 8.5. A short description is included that outlines the typical import of
each morpheme when it is used in a non-interrogative sentence (roughly, a directive
or statement) as a primary inflection, and is not further followed by an ancillary
form.
    The morphemes have been divided into separate tables according to the kind of
reference situation that they are typically used in. These divisions do not map ex-
actly to the way that the morphemes are presented in this and the following chapter,
as the overall organisation of these chapters follows the TAM vs evidential vs in-
formation status marker distinction. Rather, the tables are provided here to give
an overview of the semantic range of markers that are in broad functional contrast
within parameters regarding the illocutionary force of the utterance, and the actual-
ity and time of the event in question. Some issues concerning how these parameters
build functional paradigms of verbal inflection in Duna that cut across different
formal classes of morphemes are discussed at various points in this and the follow-
ing chapter.
    Tables 8.2 - 8.5 show those forms that are typically used as primary inflections
in statements, where a speaker tries to communicate the proposition of the utter-
ance as something that can be treated as ‘information’. These are further divided
according to the relative time and actuality of the event in question, being classified
270           Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
as generally referring to past (Table 8.2), present/habitual2 (Table 8.3), or poten-
tial time (Table 8.4). Table 8.5 shows those morphemes that are typically used in
directive utterances where the speaker tries to get other people to perform (or not
perform) the denoted action.
     The inflections shown in Table 8.2 and Table 8.3 are drawn from the TAM
marker, evidential marker, and information status marker groups (shown in the table
in that order, divided by horizontal lines). Inflections that relate to potential time are
all TAM markers except for one information status marker, included in the bottom
row. Directive inflections are all classified as TAM markers.","[298, 299]"
"6.4.3   Multiple areas -kuru
The place phrase marker -kuru marks a phrase that refers to multiple areas, describ-
ing a group of like settings.27 Examples are shown in (366) - (368).(366)    hina khei [anda manda manda -ra-kuru]                      ke-ya-roko...

  26
      I assume that in this example Sipiki is a separate object NP (the P argument of mbite- ‘cross
river’), not part of the place phrase.
   27
      Unlike -ka, -kuru does not occur following ndu. I assume this is because their semantic spe-
cifications are at odds, that is, ndu is semantically singular and -kuru is non-singular.
196                                                Chapter 6. NP, PP, and PlcP morphology
    There are no examples in my data of -kuru combining with the interrogative pa-
‘query’ to form an interrogative meaning ‘what places?’ (or similar). However,
the form pa-kuru does occur in the textual data in a specialised construction that
is used to describe mysterious or extraordinary places, typically those that are the
realm of pikono narrative (§1.3.3.1) and can never be known by people in ordinary,
everyday way. Pakuru follows a verbal clause (predication ‘X’) in a phrase that
means something like ‘places where X happens’. Two examples are shown in (369)
and (370).28 In (369), the speaker describes how a woman in a story (who has
wandered off, flouting the express orders of her brother) is charmed by a water spirit
and led down into his mysterious world of underground rivers (see Haley 2002). In
(370), the hero of a pikono story takes leave of his beautiful female companion,
going off on a journey of his own into distant regions of the pikono world.(369)    siri ndu kho hoa-ta           ho-na        salo      ka-ta           si-ya-ta         ipa

         (P/KY:KG05)6.4.4    Other ways of denoting locations
In this section I describe some further kinds of referring expressions that denote
times and places, in order to give a fuller picture of how description of spatial and
temporal locations can be included in a clause.
  28
     I find this construction difficult to analyse, and to do so would require a more comprehensive
analysis of Duna (including further examination of complex sentences) than is attempted in this
thesis. However, I believe it is suggestive of a relationship between the interrogative root pa and
the ‘individual standpoint’ marker pa that occurs as a verbal inflection (§9.3.2.1). Briefly, it makes
sense to interpret the interrogative root ‘query’ and the predicate marker ‘INDV’ as (deriving from)
a single form pa which is concerned with not knowing. This is commensurate with the occurrence
of forms such as -ra ‘SHRD’ as both an epistemic demonstrative and a predicate marker. The inter-
rogative function of pa (‘query’) relates to the epistemic demonstrative function of forms such as
-ra, and indicates that the referent of a phrase is not known (specifically, not known to the speaker
but assumed to be known to the addressee). When it marks a final predicate, pa (INDV) indicates
that the speaker knows about the predicated activity, but assumes that this is individual knowledge,
not necessarily shared by the addressee. Examples such as (369) and (370) give a window into a
situation where pa is exploited as: a form that is demonstrative-like, as it is followed by the place
phrase marker -kuru in a referring expression; and a marker that affixes to a verb root in a clause that
describes an ‘unknown’ situation.

6.4.4.1    Locational demonstratives and -nga ‘EXCV’
The bound form -nga occurs on personal pronouns (§6.6.2) and the locational demon-
strative roots ho ‘here’ and ha ‘there’. Its generalised meaning concerns emphatic
and exclusive identification of a referent.
    Locational demonstratives that are marked with -nga reference locations that
are exclusively identified as ‘exactly here’ (honga) or ‘exactly there’ (hanga). Ex-
amples are shown in (371) and (372).(371)     inu   ho-nga       waki-ya ra-o.

          ‘You have brought something to the house right here.’ (T/YS:270205)6.4.4.2    Time marker -ngi
The bound morpheme -ngi (TIME) occurs on words or phrases that describe the tem-
poral setting of the predicate. This marker can be viewed as somewhat equivalent
to a PlcP marker, used in the formation of a special kind of phrase (a ‘time phrase’)
that occurs only as an adjunct expression in the clause. However there is insufficient
data at present to be able to describe a general template for such a phrase.
    The time marker is attested occurring on common nouns, adjectives, and loca-
tional or class II epistemic demonstratives (examples shown in (374) - (377)), and
(rarely) on two-word phrases as in (378) (see also (389)). In some combinations -ngi
appears to be only minimally productive, occurring in fixed idiomatic expressions.(374)     ho-yarua-ngi       elekota ruwa-ta ndu se             neya-o.

  29
     Note that anda ‘house’ is not marked as locative so cannot be interpreted as a separate NP that
references a goal or location. Rather, it is part of phrase that finishes with honga.

probably represents a conventionalised use of the temporal marker rather than pro-
ductive application of it.
    There is one example in the data (379) of the temporal marker -ngi occurring
in combination with the interrogative pa-. Pa-ngi seems to express an indefinite
time (‘sometime’), but further data are required to test this. Example (379) is taken
from a pikono narrative; at this point in the story the hero is teasing a host of young
women who are keen to come and spend time with him. He has told them that he
can’t be with them now, but that one day in the future they will see signs that a big
party is about to happen and they should come then.(379)    ha     pa-ngi        warama pana-ta            wa-no        ri-tia-e

(380). The temporal interrogative is not productively compositional, although it
bears a clear relation to the productive interrogative root pa (as well as having a
final syllable that is suggestively similar to -ngi).(380)    ko antia paneki hutia.

    ‘Sweet potato time’ is contrasted with specific periods that are defined by the availability of wild

6.4.4.3    Territory marker -li
The bound form -li (TERR) occurs on locational and directional demonstratives,
forming a word that refers to a place. In all noted examples the place is a region that
is occupied by a distinct cultural/linguistic group, suggesting that -li is a ‘country’
or ‘territory’ designator.31 However, -li is rare in the textual data and the scope of
its application (both formally and semantically) is not known. Two examples are
shown in (381) and (382).

(382)     no ndulu ho-li            ka-ta,           ngei yoko nga-ya, Koro-nda ngo.

          ‘Once from here [i.e., Duna territory], I went without stopping, I went to
          Oksapmin.’ (T/PK:201003ii)
    Some other occurrences of -li include use of roma-li (‘above-TERR’) to refer
to the Mt Hagen area, and sopa-li (‘below-TERR’) to refer to the low-altitude Bo-
gaia/Yeru region (§1.1.2).32
    The morpheme -li is akin to the place phrase markers -ka and -kuru as it forms a
place-referent expression based on a demonstrative root. However, it is unlike these
markers in that it has only ever been observed to mark a single lexeme, never a
phrasal constituent, and does not precisely share PlcP marker distributional restric-
tions, as it does not occur on Class II epistemic demonstratives, and can occur on
locational demonstratives.
    According to a conversation I had with PK, it is perfectly sensible to add -li
‘TERR’ to the interrogative pa- ‘query’. Unfortunately I did not record the meaning
of pali, and there are no examples of this word in the textual data. I assume that it
means something like ‘which territory/country?’.
6.4.4.4    Morphologically unmarked oblique NPs
Certain kinds of NPs can occur as place-referent adjuncts in a clause without overt
marking as to their semantic role and oblique relation. These include NPs that con-
sist of: a placename only; a word formed with -(a)nda ‘enclosure, shelter, dwelling’
  31
      The Huli-English Dictionary (Rule and unknown collaborators 1971) records a Huli suffix -ali
‘tribe’ and this is perhaps a related form.
   32
      KK and RA suggested that, based upon observing latitude relationships on maps of the world,
sopa-li could also be used to refer to Australia, and eto-li to refer to the USA. I do not know if this is
common practice. The sequence li also occurs in some placenames (e.g., Ekali (Ekali/Agali, SHP),
previously Yeru territory and now occupied by Bogaia people), and this may be a related form.
200                                               Chapter 6. NP, PP, and PlcP morphology
or -yaki ‘side’ (§5.2.1.2); or a locational or directional demonstrative that is marked
with -na ‘SPEC’ and functions as a pro-form for a particular (endophorically or
exophorically identifiable) place.
    Examples (383) - (386) show NPs that consist of a placename. A nominal phrase
headed by a common noun would be overtly marked as a location or goal-like entity
in clauses predicated by existential or motion verbs; see, for example, (314) and
(319) in §6.3.4.2. However, an NP that consists of a placename typically is not.
Such words are inherently place-referent and their relationship to the predicate can
be assumed.33(383)    inu    Kalipopo ra-o.

  33
      In some cases it is alternatively possible to argue that unmarked NPs are arguments that are
semantically required by the predicate, and that this is the reason they are realised as unmarked.
Whilst it is certainly true that NPs that I analyse as unmarked obliques typically occur with motion
and existential verbs (i.e., those verbs for which it would be quite sensible to argue for subcategor-
ised location or goal-like arguments), the ‘core argument’ interpretation does not account for the
acceptability of sentences such as (385) and (386). In these examples the placenames Hakene and
Yerikuru are unmarked NPs, but there is no obvious reason why the predicates in these clauses would
‘require’ a place-like argument.
   34
      This place name appears to include the ‘place group’ marker -kuru as a fossilised form.

    Example (389) shows two unmarked oblique NPs that consist of a demonstrative
marked with -na ‘SPEC’. Context makes their place-referent function clear because
the sentence is about two known individuals who live at different places and thus
are not able to meet easily; sopa-na ‘the below one’ is understood to refer to the
place Ekali (the low-altitude Bogaia settlement in the Strickland Gorge), and hona
‘the here one’ is understood to refer to Rewapi-Hirane (where the sentence is being

to Aluni, a Duna area that is lower than Hirane (but higher and closer than Ekali,

(met on the road) is coming from. In this case other relevant context is that the
speaker has close land and family ties in Aluni and travels there often; Aluni is thus
the most salient ‘below one’ in this conversational situation.(390)   sopa-na     ko            hoa-ya.

constrained by their meaning to occur as adjunct expressions in the clause; the ma-
jor function of a word that denotes a period of time will be to describe the temporal
setting of a predicated activity.","[224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230]"

7.3     Verb serialisation
7.3.1   Introduction
A prototypical serial verb construction (SVC) is generally defined as a clause that
includes two or more verb roots that describe closely connected (and sometimes
inseparable) events, occur in sequence as a mono-clausal unit with no overt marking
of dependency or conjunction, and match the intonation pattern of a single-verb
   6
     The kind of rhyming jingle that employs reduplication and vowel alternation (for example, Eng-
lish ‘criss-cross’) is classified by Pawley as ‘Type B’, in contrast to ‘Type A’ which employs con-
sonant alternation (for example, ‘helter-skelter’).
7.3. Verb serialisation                                                                       227
clause. The serialised verbs prototypically have at least one argument in common,
and share tense, aspect and polarity values (Foley and Olson 1985; Givón 1990;
Durie 1997; Pawley and Lane 1998; Kratochvil 2007).
    For Duna, I use the term ‘verb series’ (and related terms) to refer to sequences of
verb roots for which the final verb in the sequence (Vlast ) is inflected, bearing medial
or final verb morphology, and the other verbs in the sequence (Vn ) are uninflected.7
Regular Vn verbs are in bare root form, consonantal Vn verbs in their i-base form,
and wa-class Vn verbs may occur in either a-base or i-base form (§8.1.2).8 A basic
template for an SVC is represented in Figure 7.2. The ‘x’ designation is here used
to mean ‘number of subcategorised arguments’. That is, the template indicates that
the verbs together determine the argument structure of the clause, because the num-
ber of possible argument NPs matches the number of arguments that the complex
predicate (surrounded by angled brackets) specifies. The presence of the plus sign
indicates that the elements of the predicate are treated as comprising a single root,
for example in negation with the negative circumfix (§7.3.2.3).

    Some examples of two-verb serialisations are shown in text excerpt (482), the
relevant verbs shown in bold type. I have found series of up to three verb roots in
the textual data (§7.3.2.1). There is continuity of at least one argument (usually the
subject) across serialised verbs, and in all examples noted in natural text, serialised
verbs are immediately contiguous (§7.3.2.2). Serialised verbs can be negated with
the negative circumfix as a single unit, and circumfixal negation of only one verb in
the series is strongly dispreferred (§7.3.2.3).(482)     a. heka pi      koro        kuwa-rua.

   7
      Some sequences of verbs in which Vn are marked with the non-final inflections -ya ‘DEP’ or
-ta ‘SEQ’ can also be considered as comprising serialising constructions. I do not discuss these
constructions as they belong to the larger topic of dependent clause morphology and structures and
are outside the scope of this thesis.
    8
      Giles (MSa) describes most of the constructions that I term verb serialisation (and also verb
adjunct+verb combinations, see §7.4) as ‘compounding’. This is in many ways a sensible alternative
term, but I do not use it as the term ‘compound verb’ commonly implies a verb that is formed from
a verb root in combination with a defective verb or non-verb morpheme; see, for example, Trask
(1993), Aikhenvald (1999).

in sequence. These sentences are examples of time iconic SVCs as the activity that
happens first is presented first in the series. Other examples of this type, including
serialised verbs that describe overlapping as well as sequential activities, are shown
in §7.3.3.1. The subsequent sections also exemplify serialised verbs that: describe
events that have a purposive relationship (i.e., Vlast occurs in order that Vn may
take place) (§7.3.3.2); denote integrated activities or a single activity (§7.3.3.3); and
contribute aspectual or directional meaning to the predicate (§7.3.3.4).","[255, 256, 257]"
"1.2.4    Previous description of the language
Previous descriptions of the Duna language that have been available to me comprise
three unpublished works, one by Dennis and Nancy Cochrane, and two by Glenda
Giles.
    The missionary team Dennis and Nancy Cochrane produced a 26-page manu-
script, ‘Duna essentials for translation’ for submission to the Grammar Department
of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) in 1966. Voorhoeve (1975) cites this
document (plus two wordlists) as his source.
    Glenda Giles produced an (undated) 11-page ‘Guide to the Pronuciation of
Duna’, as well as a set of 41 ‘Duna language lessons’ comprising approximately
109 pages25 and a 5-page index (cross-referenced to the numbered lessons) of bound
morphemes and irregular verb forms. These were probably produced in the 1970s,
and stemmed from Giles’ intensive work on the language in the course of bible
translation and other mission work with Duna people.26 Lessons are typically struc-
tured around the introduction of bound verbal morphology and/or irregular verb
inflections, with examples of every newly introduced form, and practice exercises
that require knowledge of material presented in earlier and later lessons. She also
provides several summaries of covered material. The description in her lessons is
occasionally repetitive and/or contradictory, as it is clear that she was developing
her analysis as she wrote, and did not regard the document that I have a copy of as
representing a final version.27
  25
      In the copy I have of the document a few pages are clearly missing but I do not know exactly
how many.
   26
      It seems likely that Giles had access to the Cochranes’ report before she started her work, and
that she and the Cochranes worked together to some extent. Giles’ major Duna project was the
translation of the New Testament, and this was presumably something the Cochranes were initially
working towards; mission gossip has it that the Cochranes were extremely disheartened by Giles’
quick aptitude in the language and vigorous efficiency, and so gave up working on Duna themselves.
   27
      For example, in Lesson 37 Giles introduces a “general summary of the final verb” with the
following words: “The material presented here is in summary form and is not entirely consistent
with what has gone before but I think presents a more correct analysis. [...] I hope to re-order these
materials in a simpler form for language learning.”
18                                                                      Chapter 1. Introduction
    Giles typically worked with Duna speakers at Kelabo in the south-east region
(see §1.2.1), or with Duna students who were attending Koroba High School (again
predominantly drawn from the south-east region). I initially approached her work
with strong doubts about its relevance to a study of Duna as spoken in Lake Kopi-
ago, as a number of people had made comments that her materials represented a
very different variety of the language.28 However, the differences I have found
between Giles’ manuscript data and the 2003-7 data collected from Duna speakers
of the north-west region are quite small,29 and less than I originally anticipated.
    Giles’ manuscripts have been extremely useful to me in my study, particularly in
the middle stages of my work.30 Her materials have in many cases provided me with
ideas and/or confirmation concerning analyses of many forms and structures in the
2003-7 data, as well as additional language data through the example sentences that
she provides throughout her materials (see also §1.3.3). Although our approaches
are quite different (for example, her purpose is primarily pedagogical whereas mine
is descriptive) and our structural analyses of the Duna language diverge in many
respects, my description owes a good deal to Giles’ earlier work. I have noted
very few bound forms that Giles does not provide some mention of in her work,
and very few instances of a significantly divergent semantic interpretation of these
forms from the ones I present in this thesis. In several cases I have adopted the
labels that Giles proposed for particular verbal inflections and verb classes, and this
is indicated when the terms are first introduced. Throughout this thesis I further
reference other sections of Giles’ work which I found especially comprehensive,
and/or which I judge contributed significantly to the development of my analysis.
    As intimated throughout this chapter, the Duna world has been investigated and
described by researchers in the fields of anthropology and ethnomusicology. Sev-
eral of these researchers include extensive documentation and discussion of Duna
vocabulary, as well as including Duna text in their works. I also draw upon these
sources to some extent in my analysis of the language and these are cited as relevant  28
      Duna speakers (from Lake Kopiago) with whom I was able to work before going to the field
suggested that Giles’ work was a description of Duna as spoken in the south-east, and was not
highly applicable to north-west Duna. Academic researchers working in Lake Kopiago, Horale, and
the Aluni Valley also all reported that Giles’ description was unhelpful to them in terms of language
learning in the field (which is not to say that they did not learn Duna), and the main reason given for
this was dialect difference.
   29
      For example, there are a few cases where a bound morpheme described by Giles was unattested
in the 2003-7 textual data. The Duna speakers I worked with found these forms readily interpretable,
but typically identified them (in full knowledge that I had noted them in Giles’ work) as being
specific to south-east Duna or being of Huli origin. Some lexical differences were also noticeable
(§1.2.1).
   30
      This statement has a kind of backwards logic, but is nevertheless true; it was often only after I
had independently arrived at a tenable analysis of something that aspects of Giles’ description would
suddenly make perfect sense. See §9.2.6.3.

throughout the thesis.","[46, 47, 48]"
"3.5     Adjectives
I refer to a group of Duna words that have formal features of both nominal and
verbal roots and generally describe properties of things as adjectives. Like nom-
inals and unlike verbs, adjectives can occur as clausal predicates in bare root form
(§4.1.1.2). They may also occur as modifiers in nominal phrases (§5.2.2). Adjectival
roots can be inflected with some morphology that is not available to nominal roots,
for example the habitual inflection -na (see, for example, (50)). Certain adjectives
can occur in a complex predicate construction with the verb ka- ‘be/stand’, describ-
ing the inception or achievement of a change of state (§7.5.4.3).15
    Some examples of Duna adjectives are shown in Table 3.7. I have grouped to-
gether adjectives that have some semantic features in common (for example, dealing
with dimension), but I do not propose that each group represents a distinct category.
The forms in Table 3.7 represent the four ‘core semantic types’ that are typically as-
sociated with the word class adjective (dimension, age, value and colour), as well as
the ‘peripheral semantic types’ of physical property and human propensity (Dixon
2004).
    As can be seen in Table 3.7, many adjectival words finish with a sequence Vo. In
Duna as spoken in the Kopiago area, the final o is subject to deletion in some lexical
items with no clear change in meaning or function.16 It is highly likely that this
final o is a semi-fossilised reflex of the perfective verbal inflection, -o (§8.2.2.1).17
  13
      Note that I designate these forms as members of a particular word class rather than as con-
stituents that are occupying a particular structural/functional position in construction with a verb.
This Duna word class could also be termed that of ‘coverbs’, following the use of this term in the
Australianist literature.
   14
      As a general rule, if the root is not attested occurring with final verb morphology (or has been
judged unacceptable in combination with it), typically occurs in bare root form, and immediately
precedes a consonantal or wa-class verb in all known examples, I interpret it as a verb adjunct, not a
verb.
   15
      The root kete ‘small’ can additionally be used in adverbial expressions (see, for example, (425)).
However this is not a general characteristic of adjectival roots.
   16
      Results of the orthography survey carried out with Duna speakers from the Kelabo area suggest
that deletion of the o is not acceptable for speakers of the south-west Duna variety.
   17
      Cf. Givón’s (1970) contention that adjectives in English are typically derived rather than simple

                    ndeo        ‘hard’ (GG)This analysis would suggest that the roots in question originally had a more clearly
inceptive or progressive meaning (e.g., ‘become big’, ‘become yellow’) and that the
perfective inflection was added to indicate complete achievement of the specified
change. This can also be argued for those adjectival roots that end in u, as the
perfective inflection has an allomorph -u.
    Some adjectival roots, such as kete ‘small’, typically occur in nominal phrases
whereas others such as rakare ‘cold’ typically occur as predicates of verbal clauses.
The latter term can be negated with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3), whereas
the former cannot. The behaviour of all adjectival roots with respect to this property
is not known. However, it is likely that further study will provide formal evidence
for the existence of different noun-like and verb-like classes within the proposed
group of adjectival roots, primarily relating to a distinction between properties that
are more time-stable, and those that are more dynamic.","[109, 110]"

nominal/verbal roots, similar to the emotion words exemplified in §7.6.2.2. I treat
itake ‘fear’ as a root of this kind. This form can occur as a final predicate as in (623)
and (624), in an NP (625), and must be negated as a unit (626). The latter feature in
particular suggests that while itake may derive from a complex predicate using the
verb ke- ‘see’, it has been reanalysed as a single root.(623)       no hata         itake-o.

or as nominals.26                                     Table 7.14 Some emotion words                   suru         ‘happiness, be happy’

                   kõkõ       ‘annoyance, be annoyed’

                   kewa         ‘boredom, disinclination, be bored/disinclined’    In examples (628) and (629) the emotion words khenowa ‘sad, be sad’ and kõkõ
‘annoyed, be annoyed’ are verbal predicates, marked with the individual stand-
point marker -pa (§9.3.2.1) and the sensory evidential -yatia (§9.2.4.4), respectively.
These bound morphemes typically only occur on verbal roots. In (628) and (629)
the emotion words behave as monovalent verbs.(628)      ee, are,         ya, no khenowa-pa

           ‘Hmmn, [she] was extremely annoyed it is said.’ (T/PK:080605ii)
  26
       The word koko ‘sympathy (etc.)’ can also function as an independent utterance (§3.11).
7.6. Complex predicates that describe involuntary experience                                      265
    Emotion words can also combine with a verb as part of a complex predicate.
In these instances the emotion words are noun-like, and parallels to several of the
complex predicate structures described in the preceding sections are observable.
    Example (630) shows khenowa ‘sad’ occurring with the verb wa- ‘do, have’.
The pronoun that references the sorrower is in the contrastive subject form (§6.6.1),
showing that that an experiencer can be overtly identified as the subject argument
of the clause.27 As wa- is a bivalent verb, this is structurally analogous to an object-
verb predication. The emotion word supplies the main semantics of the clause,
supported by a bivalent verb that takes it as a P argument.(630)    awe ka khenowa wa-nda=pe neya-nda.

         ‘Later will you be sorry or not?’ (T/HS:080305iii)    Examples (631) -(633) show khenowa ‘sadness’, suru ‘happiness’ and lembo
‘anger’ occurring in combination with the verb ka- ‘be’. The verb supplies inceptive
meaning in clauses that describe a change in emotional state. In (631) and (632), the
emotion word is modified by the adjective phuka ‘big’. These examples are similar
to object-verb type predications with ka- (§7.5.4.2).(631)    ke-ya-roko          na         ri-ya   no khenowa phuka kone

         rapid anger be/stand-DEP
         ‘[She] quickly became angry...’ (T/JP:KG05V7.11)    In constructions with ka-, a stimulus/goal for the emotion may be realised in the
clause as a locative NP, as in (634).(634)    no ko-ta         khenowa koya.
         1SG 2SG-LOC sadness            be/stand.IMPV
         ‘I am sorry for you.’ (ED)    In (635) the emotion word khenowa functions as a noun in an expanded exist-
ential possessive clause (which in this example is also a relative clause).
  27
     The ‘contrast’ here is (parallel) contrastive focus, as the speaker is naming each of her children
in turn and asking if they will feel sorry upon her death.

         ‘Men who have sympathy towards their wives make sweet potato mounds
         [i.e., help women in their customary labours].’ (ED/III:34)    At least some emotion words occur with verbs of motion in the same way as
nouns that describe involuntarily released bodily substances, in the adjunct noun
type construction described in §7.6.1.1.28 In all noted examples, the emotion word
is reduplicated as shown in (636) and (637).(636)    khewa-khewa         nga-yarua.

         empty-DEP loneliness-loneliness go-SNS . C
         ‘[The place] is empty and [I] am lonely.’ (ED/VIII:70)    In example (638) khenowa appears to exploit its verbal and nominal properties
in the one clause. It is noun-like in that it is modified by an adjective, but also verb-
like in that the predicate as a whole is marked with the dramatic morpheme rakunu
(§9.3.3.3). This morpheme is otherwise only attested occurring on verbal roots.(638)    kono     anga ra-ya          nga-ya, khenowa antia kone-rakunu.

         ‘[He] kept on thinking about it, and was incredibly sad.’ (T/YS:KG05V7.22)    Emotion words thus show a constructional polysemy that is unusual in the Duna
lexicon. They can be treated as describing an activity, but also as denoting a kind
of substance that is (involuntarily) produced by an experiencer subject, being em-
ployed in a range of constructions that are somewhat parallel to complex predica-
tions with nouns and adjectives.","[291, 292, 293, 294, 295]"
"4.2.3.1       Reflexive clauses
A clause with reflexive semantics describes a situation in which something acts
upon itself, fulfilling both the actor and undergoer participant roles required by a
bivalent predicate.13 As far as I am aware Duna does not have a distinct formal
construction that is specifically reserved for this kind of situation. In certain cases,
a clause can be identifed as reflexive, but this is a semantic rather than morpho-
syntactic label.
    Examples (72) and (73) show clauses headed by the complex predicate waya
sa- ‘wash’. This predicate can head a clause with non-reflexive meaning (72), or
reflexive meaning (73).
  13
       I have no data regarding reflexive trivalent clauses.
110                                                    Chapter 4. Basic clause structure

          1SG baby     wash take.PFV
          ‘I washed the baby’ (ED/V:27) (73) ko waya so-wei.
          2SG wash take-PROHIB
          ‘Don’t wash [yourself]!’ (ED/VII:23)    I analyse NPs such as the pronoun ko ‘2SG’ in (73) as subject NPs that are under-
stood to ‘stand for’ both the actor and undergoer participants that are required by the
predicate. The semantics of the predicate, the lack of any overt P argument, exclus-
ivity marking (see following) and/or emphatic double pronoun reference (§5.4.2.3)
generate a strong implication of reflexive meaning.
    A subject NP in a semantically reflexive clause is likely to be an ‘exclusive’
nominal phrase, that is, a pronominal NP marked with the exclusive identification
marker -nga ‘EXCV’ (§6.6.2). This reference strategy indicates that an A or S argu-
ment acts solely by, for, and/or upon themselves or their possessions,14 and is not
restricted to reflexive clauses. An example of a reflexive clause that includes an NP
marked with -nga is shown in (74). The example shown in (75) can be considered
reflexive or not, depending on whether one includes in the definition that actor and
undergoer can be in a whole-part relationship rather than completely co-identified. (74) no-nga         sa-ta      khene-nda.

          1SG-EXCV 1SG hand/arm axe-INSTR cut-PFV
          ‘I cut my hand with an axe.’ (CED/VIII:184)4.2.3.2    Reciprocal clauses
Examples (76) and (77) show clauses headed by bivalent predicates that describe
semantically reciprocal events. Two entities perform the same predicated activity
upon each other and so correspond to both the actor and undergoer participants
required by the predicate, as they simultaneously ‘do’ and ‘be done unto’. In (76)
and (77), the clause includes a single NP that refers to both participants; this is
typical of semantically reciprocal clauses that occur in the Duna textual data. Verbs
that describe a reciprocal activity are usually marked by a morphological operation
which indicates multiple instantiations of the predicate, that is, reduplication (full
or partial) of the root and/or the iterative affix -(r)uri (§7.2.3), as in both of these
examples. Such marking is not exclusive to clauses with reciprocal meaning.
  14
    KK and RA felt that use of -nga was most appropriate for situations involving high animacy
possessions, such as children and domestic animals.

          ‘The pair would trick each other...’ (T/HY:201003ii)    Example (78) shows a clause with reciprocal meaning that is headed by a trivalent
predicate, the complex lexeme ngirane ngirane-, meaning ‘exchange’.15 In this con-
struction the givers and recipients are in a reciprocal relationship, and correspond
to a single NP, the dual pronoun keno. (78)     keno ngalipe ngirane ngirane-o.
          1DL peanut.lw exchange exchange-PFV
          ‘We two exchanged peanuts (with each other).’ (CED/VII:8)    As for reflexive subjects, I interpret unmarked NPs such as those that occur in
(76) - (78) as subject NPs that stand for both the actor and undergoer participants
that are required by the predicate, or, in the case of a trivalent predicate, for both the
givers and recipients. Overtly marking a nominal phrase such as keno in (78) as a
contrasted subject triggers a slightly different reading of the clause, in which an R
argument NP is assumed to have been elided.16 (79)     kena-ka ngalipe ngirane ngirane-o.
          1DL-CS peanut exchange exchange-PFV
          ‘We two (as a pair) exchanged peanuts (with other people).’ (CED/VII:8)    In the constructed example shown in (80), each participant is referenced by
a separate NP. I believe this is best interpreted as a ‘collocated’ NP construction
(§5.4.1), that is, with anoa ndu and ima ndu being collocated as a multi-referent
subject argument rather than representing distinct A and P arguments.17 (80)     anoa ndu ima          ndu rembo rembo-ya rei.
          man one woman one stare             stare-DEP be/sit.STAT
          ‘A man and a woman are sitting staring at each other.’ (CD/V:70)
  15
      This is presumably derived from the trivalent verb ngua- ‘give’ and the sequential (switch)
medial inflection -rane, although as far as I am aware this morphological template is not productive.
   16
      It is alternatively possible to use contrasted subject marking as an indication of contrastive focus
in reciprocal clauses, for example, to emphasise that out of a group of potential participants, it was
X and Y in particular who engaged in a reciprocal activity; see §5.4.2.3.
   17
      The collocation analysis seems the most sensible interpretation because encoding the parti-
cipants of a reciprocal activity as one NP is the usual pattern in the textual data.
112                                                  Chapter 4. Basic clause structure
    Example (81) shows another constructed clause in which the verb is reduplic-
ated, and two NPs are present; however, in this case the first is marked as a contras-
ted subject. KK thought that the most likely interpretation for this clause was that
a cat or cats scratched other cats, but that reciprocal semantics were not strongly
implied. The first NP, puti nduka (‘a cat’ or ‘each cat’), is interpreted as an A argu-
ment, the second, ndu (‘one’), as a P argument. Reduplication of the verb indicates
multiple instantiations of the predicate activity, triggering the reading that there are
several P arguments, and possibly also several A arguments. (81) phuti ndu-ka ndu hara-ra-tia.

          ‘A/Each cat scratched others.’ (CD)4.2.3.3    Argument elision
Predicate arguments are not obligatorily realised as NPs in the clause, but may be
covertly ‘referenced’ through zero anaphora. A lack of any overt reference signals
to a listener that they should identify the ‘missing’ argument as a participant that
has already been referred to in the preceding discourse, or can be inferred from
exophoric context.
    Example (82) shows an elided S argument, the identity of which is understood
from exophoric context. This was a comment made by a child upon seeing an
elephant in a film; the S argument of the clause is clearly understood to be this
unfamiliar animal. (82)           ho-li      hoa-na=pe.
                here-TERR come-PROPH=Q
          ‘Will [that animal] come here?’ (OH)    Example (83) shows a clause headed by the trivalent verb ngua- ‘give’ in which
the A, R, and T arguments are not overt. This utterance was called out by an audi-
ence member during a pikono performance. The previous few minutes of the per-
formance have been devoted to describing how one of the heroes of the story has
killed and cooked numerous pigs for a feast, and detailing the guests that he is now
giving food to. All of the participants can thus be inferred from the context of the
narrative. (83)                   ngi-ku-rape
                        give-EXHAUST-UNC
          ‘Maybe [he] has given [all the guests] [all the meat].’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).4))    The text excerpt shown in (84) exemplifies text-based zero anaphoric reference
of an S/A argument that is maintained across several clauses. Each line is a clausal
4.2. Participant reference in verbal clauses                                                     113
unit,18 commas indicating rising intonation followed by a pause, and full stops
indicating falling intonation followed by a pause. The subject of the first clause
shown, (84a), is realised as an NP, no ‘1SG’ (shown in bold). This participant (the
speaker) is maintained as a subject argument across seven subsequent clauses. Hori-
zontal dashed lines in the Duna text represent the gapped argument.19 Identification
of the missing argument is supported in a number of ways, for example: there are
no other participants mentioned that could potentially occur as arguments of these
predicates; the gapped argument is highly animate, and thus a good candidate for
‘topical continuity’ (Givón 1983); most of the predicates are monovalent, so there
is no potential for ambiguity or misidentification of an argument position; and four
of the clauses completely or partially repeat the predicate of the preceding clause.
When a different subject argument is introduced in (84i), this participant is overtly
referenced as a nominal phrase. The medial verbal inflection that precedes this
clause, -roko, also strongly predicts (but does not absolutely determine) that S or A
argument identity is about to change. (84)     a. no waya sa-ya            ngo.

     Serialised verbs (§7.3) and certain multiple verb structures (for example purposive and aspectual
chaining constructions) are counted as a single unit.

"9.3.3.3    Dramatic markers
The morphemes -raka and -rakunu/-rakuru (‘DRAMA’) are added to final verb pre-
dicates that describe past events and indicate that this event was (or is) surprising,
impressive, or contrary to expectations. I do not know what contrasts the three dif-
ferent forms express. The dramatic markers are added to the o-base of consonantal
verbs and, according to the very limited data available, to the i-base of wa-class
verbs and the a-base of partial members of the wa-class group. There is no evid-
ence that the dramatic markers can occur as ancillary markers; in my data they are
only used as inflectional forms. Further data and analysis are required to better un-
derstand the meanings of the dramatic markers and the range of structures they may
occur in.
    An example of -raka is shown in (845), taken from a story in which two women
are busy eating and are unaware that two men are approaching until they are sud-
denly upon them. The final verb kundu- refers to a loud noise. It is noticeable that
-raka and rakur(/n)u often mark noisy events.(845)     ho-na     ruka-ta        na-ya ka-roko,         anene roma-ra-ka

used to make a story sound better and more exciting. In the textual data this form
rarely occurs in texts from younger speakers.51 Some more examples of -raka and
rakur/nu are shown in text excerpts (849) and (850). These describe points of high
drama in stories, situations where the true nature of a wicked protagonist is suddenly
revealed to a main sympathetic character. In (849), a cannibal woman had pretended
to be dead in order to lure a man to his death; now she rises from her grave. In the
story from which (850) is taken, a cannibal tricks and traps men by pretending to be
a little boy who needs help reaching grubs inside a split piece of wood; at the vital
moment he lets the halves of the piece of wood spring shut, catching his victim.(849)     a. sopa kaki-ra          ro-na-ka               kilikulu kilikulu kilikulu-raka.

9.3.4.1    Introduction
The ‘expective’ (§9.3.4.2) and ‘potential observation’ (§9.3.4.3) markers occur with
inflectional function only. These forms are rare in the textual data; I first became
aware of their existence from Giles (MSa).52 I collectively term these inflections the
‘provocative’ markers because they are used when the speaker wishes to provoke the
addressee’s attention towards the predicated activity in a particular way.
    The expective and potential observation inflections both allude to potential events.
In the case of the expective inflection, a clause that is so marked describes a potential
event that the speaker thinks the addressee should think about before taking a course
of action. In the case of the potential observation inflection, the potential event is
not the activity denoted by the verb itself, but the addressee’s potential witnessing
of this activity. I find it illuminating to think of these forms as being to do with a
kind of event modality (§8.2.1) that is oriented toward the addressee’s awareness of
the predicate event. The speaker expresses a modal attitude towards the addressee’s
knowledge store, indicating that the addressee either should know or could have
seen something, thus showing some commonality with impersonal evidentials.53 In
using these markers the speaker urges the addressee to take epistemic responsibility
for the predicated activity by either recognising it as a pertinent piece of informa-
tion that should inform their actions (expective), or considering the evidence of the
predicated activity that could be available to them (potential observation).54
  52
      Giles (MSa) terms the forms I label expective and potential observation as ‘general experience’
and ‘past known to speaker’, respectively. The latter term is transparent. She defines the use of the
‘general experience’ forms as being used “when a statement is based on the speaker’s knowledge
from his general experience of what has or will happen in a certain situation” (MSa:37).
   53
      Molochieva’s (2006) Chechen data, as presented in Bickel (2007), intimates that the special
addressee-directed construction evidential/mirative in this language has overtones of a (deontic)
modal attitude to the addressee’s knowledge, and expresses the speaker’s opinion that the addressee
‘must know’ or ‘must have noticed’ the predicated event.
   54
      A possibility remains that the provocative inflections evoke an impersonal viewpoint, rather
than specifically targeting epistemic features in regard to the addressee. That is, they may be more
appropriately paraphrased as something like ‘it could have been seen’ rather than ‘you could have
356                               Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
    The provocative inflections are commonly associated with two kinds of speech
acts, giving directives and eliciting information (see also §11.1). A verb inflected
as expective or potential observation rarely occurs utterance-finally in my data, as
in most cases the provocative clause is immediately followed by an instruction or
question for the addressee. These markers have somewhat intermediate status as
final verb inflections, and could alternatively be interpreted as a medial inflections.
Under either analysis it is necessary to make some additional stipulations concern-
ing their uses.559.3.4.2    Expective marker
The expective inflection marks events that the speaker thinks likely to happen or
likely to have happened. It additionally implies something of a warning or reproach
to the addressee, as it marks a situation that the speaker thinks the addressee should
already have paid attention to or considered. A warning implication (‘look out,
this bad thing could happen’ ) is particularly common, so that the expective usually
functions similarly to an ‘admonitive’ (for example, in Maidu Shipley 1964), or ‘ap-
prehensive’ (for example, in Australian languages.). However, the implication that
the marked clause represents a specifically negative consequence is not a necessary
feature (see (853) and (854)).
    With regular verbs, the marker -nanoko is added to the root. For consonantal
verbs, the form -nako is added to the a-base, and for wa-class verbs -nako is added
to the a-base form, or -nanako to the u-base.56
    Clauses that are marked with the expective inflection are commonly accom-
panied by an instruction, as in (851) - (854). The speaker immediately supplies
direction on how the addressee should act on the information they are being given.(851)     sapulu-na        sa-nako,      kua peli-pa.

seen’. Further data are needed to explore this issue, for example concerning the acceptability of
second person subject with these forms.
   55
      It is significant that the provocative markers end in the sequence ko; the form -ko occurs as a
productive marker of subordination, following a final inflection (see, for example, (1012)). However,
in the case of the expective and potential observation markers it is not helpful to say that ko is
occurring as a marker of subordination, as it is not possible to coherently identify the sequences to
which it is added as productive inflectional forms.
   56
      Further data are needed to establish whether the two possibilities for wa-class verbs are con-
trastive. Giles’ data include only the a-base + nako option.

     The expective marker appears to be particularly suitable for when the speaker
is additionally somewhat frustrated with or surprised at the addressee for missing
some information that is obvious and/or highly pertinent to a current situation. This
is illustrated by examples (853) and (854). KK and RA were quite specific about
the situations that these utterances were appropriate to. They suggested that (853)
was suitable if I was running around looking for my pen and repeatedly asking
them where it was and if they had it, rather than asking another obvious person (my
partner Chris) if he had it. They agreed that (854) would be used if KK and RA had
asked me to fetch something they wanted from another person’s room, but I had
said that I couldn’t because the door might be locked.","[382, 383, 384, 385, 386]"
"11.2.3.4     ‘Impossible proposition’ interrogatives
Hale (1980) says that in rhetorical questions in Newar, conjunct and disjunct verb
forms follow the declarative rather than typical interrogative distributional pattern.
This is seen in (1115a), in which an addressee subject occurs with a disjunct verb
form, and (1115b), in which a speaker subject occurs with a conjunct verb form,
despite the fact that these examples are interrogative (as indicated by the marker
la). These sentences are not ‘true questions’ because they are not genuine requests
for information; rather, the speaker asserts that the proposition is not the case.(1115)      a. cha ana wala                lā?
               you there come.DISJUNCT INTER .
              ‘Did you come?’ (i.e., most certainly not!)
           b. ji ana wanā              lā?
              I there went.CONJUNCT INTER .
              ‘Did I go there?’ (i.e., I most certainly did not!) (NEWAR: Hale (1980),
              gloss added)    Duna appears to function similarly to Newar, disrupting the usual distributional
pattern of the intentive and prophetic inflections in interrogatives for rhetorical ef-
fect. Interrogatives formed in this way express strong doubt (yes-no interrogatives),
and/or suggest that there is no possible candidate to fill the ‘missing participant’ slot
(question word interrogatives). That is, the proposition is implied to be impossible.
For example, the (constructed) interrogative (1116) combines an addressee subject
with the prophetic inflection. My Duna consultant Timon Kangapu thought that
this could only be used in a situation where there speaker wished to imply that the

addressee would certainly not be able to go; for example, as an implied threat when
the addressee is planning to leave home in order to avoid legal action brought by the
speaker. Example (1117) shows a rhetorical interrogative with a speaker subject.(1116) ko Mospi nga-na=pe.
           2SG PLN      go-PROPH=Q

        ‘Where will I go?’ (i.e., there is nowhere) (P/AM:NH0312A)    As seen in the preceding section, interrogatives with third person and questioned
subjects do not conform to the typical conjunct/disjunct distributional pattern. Rhet-
orical interrogatives are not formally distinguished as they are with speaker and ad-
dressee subjects, but are interpreted as such from context. Example (1118) is taken
from a text in which the speaker describes how she, her siblings, and her mother
were abandoned by her father and lived without the support of adult male relatives;
there is no man to butcher their pigs.(1118) ayu ita ha-tia anoa ai-ka           paka-nda=pe ha-me        ri-ya...

        (T/KP:061103)11.2.3.5    Further comments on intentive declaratives
My data include some examples of declarative sentences in which the intentive in-
flection does not reflect typical distribution with respect to subject identity, that is,
it occurs with non-speaker subjects. Some of these are reproduced and discussed in
this section.
    One situation in which it may be appropriate for the intentive inflection to occur
in a declarative with a non-speaker subject is in the description of a situation that is
desired by the speaker, as in (1119) and (1120).(1119) inu      hapia aru       ka-na-ra-me               ayu memba

         (RA translated this constructed sentence as shown, commenting that it could be
         used in a situation where the speaker has to choose somebody to send as a messen-
         ger.)    Some other examples suggest that a speaker can use the intentive inflection to
reflect the fact that they are an authoritative informant by virtue of a close asso-
ciation with a third person subject. This is illustrated by the constructed example
shown in (1121). Line (1121a) shows the typical declarative pattern of third person
subject and a predicate that is inflected as prophetic. On being asked whether the
intentive inflection (1121b) might also be suitable, PK reflected that it could be used
“if you live with those people” whereas (1121a) would be used “if you haven’t seen
them”.(1121)     a. anita =khunu yapenengi pi         itupanengi pi   Mospi nga-na.
              gang =3PL         Tuesday    LNK Wednesday LNK PLN       go-PROPH

             ‘They will go to Moresby on Tuesday or Wednesday.’ (I live with these
             people) (CD/III:60)    Similarly, example (1122) shows a fragment of conversation (between myself
and two others) about whether or not a toddler would eat some food that I had
prepared. The toddler’s mother, Speaker B, replies to my question (1122a) using the
intentive inflection in (1122b). The other person, no relation to the child, repeats
the substance of the mother’s answer using the prophetic inflection as shown in
(1122c). I speculate that this reflects an understanding that the mother can ‘speak
for’ the child, whereas the other person does not claim this right. However, more
evidence is needed to test this hypothesis.(1122)     a. LSR: na-nda=pe, na-na-ya-nda.

                    eat-PROPH=ASSERT give.IMP
             ‘[He] will eat, give [it].’ (LC/VIII:33)   The use of the intentive inflection in examples such as (1121b) and (1122b) can
additionally be interpreted as relayed utterance, in which the speaker reproduces the
11.2. Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity                    447
speech or intention of a close associate with an assumed rather than overt ‘report’
frame.2811.2.3.6       Summary
Overall, the intentive inflection implies that an informant personally experiences an
event as an unrealised plan and is closely associated with the described situation.
Having a plan of something presupposes control (the informant is a volitional sub-
ject argument), desire (the informant wants the event to happen) and authority (the
informant has best access to knowledge of it). These features typically (and in some
cases necessarily) coincide, but may each be sufficient to independently motivate in-
tentive marking in some circumstances. It is most usual (and always grammatical)
for intentive marking to occur in declaratives with volitional speaker subjects and
interrogatives with volitional addressee subjects.
    The prophetic inflection alternatively draws attention to the actual manifesta-
tion of the event as something that will be perceivable in the future, and implies
disassociation from the described situation. The informant does not exert conscious
control over the event, and does not assert a relationship with the people involved.
This shows similarities to the disassociative implications of evidentials as described
in §11.2.2.6. It is most usual for prophetic marking to occur with third person sub-
jects in declaratives, but it may also occur (without rhetorical effect) with addressee
subjects in declaratives and speaker and third person subjects in interrogatives.","[473, 474, 475, 476]"

          PSN       =3SG netbag weave-SPEC
          ‘(I see) Monica is weaving a bilum.’ (CD/III:25)     The association of na-marking with sight raises the issue of whether specificity
marking on final verbs should be construed as part of the visual evidential category
(§9.2.3).43 It is unproblematic to say that -na in some ways ‘fills a gap’ in the evid-
ential paradigm, which does not include a ‘current visual’ category morpheme (that
is, lacks a form that describes seeing as contemporaneous with utterance). How-
ever, it is important to recognise that -na does not treat the semantics of ‘sight’ in
the same way that visual evidential markers do. With evidential markers, there is
a strong implication that the subject argument is someone other than the informant
(see, for example, (1062)). A visual evidential implies observation rather than par-
ticipation. However, with na-marking there is no such implication, and this marker
occurs freely in declarative sentences with first person subjects; see examples (827)
and (830).
     I turn now to an issue of analysis that I do not explore in detail in this thesis,
but which is significant to the development of a more comprehensive description
of the Duna language. In examples (827) - (833) I identify the form -na that is
added to an uninflected verb root as the specificity marker, that is, the same form
  43
    One argument that can be brought against this is that being able to physically see the predicated
event is not an absolute prerequisite of the morpheme’s deployment, as shown by its use with the
predicate khou ‘pain’ in (828), for which there is no clear visual manifestation, or in (832) where
-na occuring on a ‘sound’ verb that represents a birdcall. However, this latter example at least is, if
anything, supportive of an evidential interpretation as it is redolent of the use of the perfective visual
evidential marker in indexing the witnessing of sonic events (see example (756) in §9.2.3.2).

that is used to indicate that the referent of a nominal phrase is a specific (and typic-
ally definite) individual (§6.3.2.1). As is shown in the following chapter, -na SPEC
can also be added following an inflected final verb in a main clause, with similar
‘attention-drawing’ implications. There are also a number of complex constructions
in Duna in which the specificity marker -na is added to a verb (inflected or other-
wise). These include for example: relative clauses (see (682), (394)); background
reason/cause clauses (in which case the clause is overtly marked with either =nia,
-ka, or -ta, see (704), (574)); nominalised purpose clauses (often on verbs that are
marked with -noi, see (800)); complement clauses headed by the verb wa- ‘do’ (see
(345), (448)); and other reified propositions, where the activity described by the
clause is nominalised as a named situation (994) or process (30). In these cases the
verb to which -na is added can generally be regarded as heading an embedded, sub-
ordinate, and/or nominalised clause rather than an independent verbal clause. The
additional use of a SPEC-marked clause as an independent utterance seems to be an
example of ‘insubordination’ (Evans 2007).
    It can be noted in examples (827) to (833) (and elsewhere) that I typically
treat definite-marked final verbs that are sentence-final as heads of ordinary verbal
clauses. However it follows that if -na is an NP marker, its use in final clauses could
be more appropriately described as a nominalisation construction that is function-
ally related to information status, rather than an example of a potentially inflectional
information status marker. A sentence such as (830) could be analysed as a ‘non-
embedded nominalization’ (Matisoff 1972) and rendered as ‘(It is the case that) I
am spinning yarn!’, or as a cleft construction, ‘It is I who am spinning yarn!’. A
comprehensive assessment of this issue demands a thorough description of com-
plex constructions, as well as an explicit account of information structure in Duna
conversation and extended discourse, areas that I do not embark upon in this thesis
owing to time and data constraints. As a practical measure, I treat -na SPEC as it
occurs in main clauses as a morpheme that is functionally equivalent to an informa-
tion status marker, as it can: derive a finite predicate, ascribe temporal value (present
time) to the clause in which it occurs, and convey an attitude (a judgement/assertion
of ‘noteworthiness’) to the information that is encoded in the utterance.44 I translate
final verbs that are marked with the specificity marker as if they are heads of main
verbal clauses unless there is uncontroversial indication that the clause is not inde-

      cf. Woodbury (1985): In examining ‘participle constructions’ in Yup’ik Eskimo that can occur
either as noun phrases or as independent clauses, Woodbury says that: “When participle construc-
tions function as clauses [...] the participle suffixes act as mood markers. Rather than convert the
verb base to which they attach into adjectival nouns, they become part of their inflection as verbs.
[...] In addition to looking like mood markers, participle suffixes have mood meaning. They signal
vividness and sometimes exclamatory force in main clauses, forming a paradigm set with the other
main clause moods” (1985:76).

pendent but is part of a larger complex sentence structure; for example if the marked
clause bears a specific function in a matrix clause (cf. Bickel 1999:3), or is overtly
marked as a clause of purpose or reason (etc.). This is not entirely satisfactory, but
is adequate for my basic descriptive purposes.
    It is of interest to note that the Duna use of the specificity marker on final
verbs in independent clauses shows some structural and functional similarity to
non-embedded nominalisations in several Tibeto-Burman language subgroups (for
example, Kiranti and Bodic), in which a morpheme that is used in nominalisa-
tion operations (and in some cases also functions as a singular definite article in
noun phrases) marks main clauses in attention-drawing, emphatic and/or ‘constat-
ive’ (“it’s a fact”) utterances.45 More generally, these ‘nominalisations’ are probably
examples of insubordination, the independent use of an apparently (or erstwhile)
subordinate structure (Evans 2007). Two functions of insubordination identified by
Evans that are of particular relevance to the Duna and Bodic examples are the ex-
pression of epistemic and evidential meanings, and the signalling of presupposed
material.","[373, 374, 375]"

     These ‘common sense’ definitions of speaker, addressee and other follow from a fairly proto-
typical utterance situation and do not precisely capture all circumstances in which we may be able
to identify speaker and addressee parties. For example, someone might appear to address one person
whilst intending that his or her utterance be heard and acted upon by someone else; see Goffman
(1974) and Levinson (1988) for detailed proposals of how speaker and addressee roles can be sys-
tematically decomposed into more narrowly defined roles to cope more explicitly with these kinds
of circumstances. Irvine (1996) asserts the relevance of this approach for analysing language, but
argues that it remains useful to maintain the maximally simple set of speech event participant roles
(speaker, addressee, other), and derive more subtle types through reference to the complex variety
of ways these are enacted, referenced, and evoked in a given speech situation.

In regard to the difference between Duna nominal phrases consisting of a third
singular pronoun kho as opposed to those consisting of a common noun, Richard
Alo commented that, “As you are getting along with a story, kho will identify that
it is this man [...] kho will occur when you already know a particular person”.22
As Richard’s explanation indicates, third person pronouns (kho ‘3SG’, kheno ‘3DL’,
or khunu ‘3PL’) are in general used in reference to highly animate ‘others’ that
the speaker assumes are identifiable from context. Using a personal pronoun in a
sense raises this referenced participant to a level of animacy and identifiability that
is equivalent to that of speaker and addressee.
     Third person pronoun use is strongly associated with subject reference.23 In
ordinary circumstances, using a third person pronoun as an object NP is generally
considered odd or unacceptable, as illustrated by KK’s judgements of the pair of
constructed sentences shown in (204b). However, third person pronouns can be
used to highlight the fact that the identity of the object argument is unexpected and
pragmatically prominent. For example, PK said that the constructed sentence shown
in (205) would not be used normally, but would make sense in a situation in which
the speaker, intending to hit a certain person in a general skirmish, hit somebody
else by mistake.(204)     a. Keni-ka Melo-ne Justi-ne so.
                PSN - CS PSN - PR   PSN - PR   strike.PFV
                ‘Kenny hit Justin and Melo.’

                * Kenny hit the two of them (CD/VIII:111)
  22
       As recorded in XIV:127: ‘Yu wokim wanpela stori i go go nau, kho bai tok long dispela man
[...] kho em bai kam insait taim yu save pinis long wanpela particular person.’
    23
       For example, in looking at (free and encliticised) third person pronouns in three short texts,
30 out of 38 tokens occurred in subject NPs, five were in object NPs, and three were possessors.
Compare this to the 47 non-pronominal referring expressions in one of the texts, which included 16
subject NPs, 13 object NPs, and 18 obliques.

         1SG.CS 3SG strike.PFV
         ‘I hit him!’ (i.e., someone other than person I was intending to hit)
         (CD/VIII:41)    Third person pronouns can also be encliticised to a common noun NP, carrying
the same implications of animacy, topicality, and subjecthood (§6.6.3).
    The third person pronoun khunu has a further special area of use in denoting an
‘addressee group’. As seen in examples such as (200) and (202) previously, the pro-
noun inu is normally used in reference to more than two addressees, and the pronoun
khunu in reference to more than two others. However, there are a few occasions in
the data where khunu is used to denote a group of which the addressee is part.24
This use coincides with a situation in which the group referred to includes others
who are not present in the speech situation (as well as the ‘actual’ addressee(s) who
is/are there listening), and there is some increased degree of ‘distance’ (either lit-
eral or metaphorical) between the speaker and members of the addressee party. Two
examples are shown in (206) and (207). Example (206) shows a question asked of
two Duna people (KK and RA) about Duna people as a cultural group. In (207),
the speaker (KP) refers to the addressee (LSR) in conjunction with other members
of her (LSR’s) household, not present at the time the recording is made. LSR’s
household is ‘distant’ from KP in being composed entirely of Australian visitors
(also KP’s employers) in contrast to the other residents at Rewapi hamlet (KP’s
immediate kin, see §1.3.1).(206)    khunu watano          ndaka na-na=pe.

  24
    It is of relevance to note that syncretism of second and third non-singular markers (includ-
ing bound pronominal agreement forms) is common in highlands languages of New Guinea (Foley
1986:72-4, Suter 1997). Free pronouns in Huli, for example, distinguish between second and third
person in the singular but have single second/third person forms for dual and for plural (Rule 1974).
5.3. Personal pronoun, PN, and interrogative NPs                                            153
    A distinction between ‘close/present addressees’ (inu) and ‘distant/absent ad-
dressees’ (khunu) was also suggested in discussion with my Duna collaborators on
appropriate plural address terms. On one occasion when I asked about using either
inu or khunu in giving directives, KK and RA said these forms were basically inter-
changeable, but suggested that inu was more appropriate for giving commands to
a group of people that were nearby (see, for example, (200)), and khunu would be
used when shouting out a command over a distance (for example, from on top of a
hill). In talking over the two constructed questions shown in (208a) and (208b), PK
and KP initially said that they were ‘the same’, but added that (208a), in which inu
occurs, ‘includes everyone’, perhaps expressing a sense that inu maximally referred
to the present audience as an ‘in-group’, whereas khunu did not.(208)    a. inu-ka      karia-na=pe.
             1/2PL-CS shoot-SPEC=Q
             ‘Are you lot shooting?’
         b. khunu-ka karia-na=pe.
             3PL-CS      shoot-SPEC=Q
             ‘Are others (and you) shooting?’ (CD/III:96)    The apparent variation between inu and khunu in reference to groups that in-
clude addressees relates to debate concerning the existence of a grammaticised
‘second person plural clusivity’ distinction. This refers to a theoretically possible
system whereby groups that are composed of actual addressees that are all present in
the speech situation (denoted by Cysouw (2003) as a ‘2+2’ group) would be referred
to in a different way to groups that consist of an actual addressee in combination
with others who are not present (a ‘2+3’ group). Whilst the existence of such a
system has been claimed for some languages (see, for example, Giridhar (1994) on
Mao Naga, Tibeto-Burman family), Cysouw (2003) and Simon (2005) argue that
these kinds of alternations do not really encode a grammaticised person distinction,
but have to do with extended uses of categories that belong to other domains in the
grammar, are tied to the expression of variables such as politeness and solidarity, or
have simply been described as a result of misinterpreted dialect variation.
    In the Duna case, there is currently too little information to contribute definit-
ively to this debate, as there are only a few examples of the pronoun khunu being
used in reference to addressees, and very few clear instances of reference being
made to ‘2+3’ groups in the textual data in any case.25 However, it seems likely
that Duna supports Simon’s (2005) findings that where a formal alternation maps to
  25
    Note also that Giles does not explicitly describe the Duna pronominal paradigm, and the few
examples of addressee group reference that I have found in her material are with the pronoun inu.
These all seem to be ‘2+2’ situations, as they are directives such as ‘Everybody sit down’, etc.

an inclusive/exclusive distinction within second person, this relationship is largely
epiphenomenal. The function of any such variation in Duna is probably anchored in
the expression of interpersonal meaning (that is, creating a distancing effect), rather
than the reification of a distinct person category. Further study of the uses of inu
and khunu in addressee reference is needed to to test this hypothesis and obtain a
clearer understanding of what is signified by this contrast.","[178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]"
"3.2     Nominals
A prototypical semantic property of members of a ‘nominal’ word class is that
they refer to ‘time stable’ concepts (Schachter 1985:6) and designate objects (Evans
2000:710), for example persons and places.
    Duna nominal roots can constitute complete nominal phrases (NPs) by them-
selves, and typically occur in NPs that denote participants in a described event or
relationship (Chapter 5). NPs can also occur as predicates (§4.1.1.1), but unlike
predicating verbs, nominals cannot be marked with TAM markers (§8.2) or the neg-
ative circumfix (§8.3). Nominal predicates can however be marked with (a restricted
range of) epistemic assessment markers (§10.3).
    I divide Duna nominals into three subclasses: common nouns (§3.2.1), proper
names (§3.2.2), and personal pronouns (§3.2.3). The former two groups are open
classes, to which new members may be added. Personal pronouns comprise a small
closed class. See also §3.9 concerning quasi-nominal interrogative forms.",[99]

are shown in (227), where the interrogative occurs adnominally, and (228), where it
is pronominal and constitutes a complete NP.(227)     ima         pania pa-na        ra-o=pe      ri-ya...

    KK and RA suggested that the constructed sentence shown in (229) would be

In this section I describe some structures in which more than one NP corresponds
to a single grammatical participant in the clause. For example, the S participant
of a monovalent predicate may correspond to a pair of items that are individually
specified, each being referenced by a distinct NP in what I term a ‘collocation’
construction (§5.4.1). In the other complex structures treated here the NPs have
a different sort of relationship, as they do not denote different individuals that are
conjoined as a unitary participant, but rather provide extra information concerning
the nature or identity of the entity. These include ‘whole-part’ (§5.4.2.1) and in-
clusory pronominal (§5.4.2.2) constructions, double pronoun NPs (§5.4.2.3), and
adpositional identity expansion (§5.4.2.4).","[186, 187, 188]"
"‘Side’ marker -yaki    The bound form -yaki attaches to a lexical root in expressions
that denote a ‘side’, in the sense of a contrastively defined space or direction.10 In
talking about this form, Duna speakers I worked with treated it as something that
had independent denotative sense—that is, they would unpick it from a construction
of which it was part as a separate term that meant ‘side’—but it does not occur as a
free form in my data. Examples are shown in (121) - (125).(121)    khendei ipu           khana-yaki wa ka-ya...

Compounding is defined by Anderson (1985:40) as “word formation based on the
combination of two or more members of (potentially) open lexical classes”. In
this section I describe Duna compounds that are composed of two common noun
elements that form a new common noun. This kind of word formation does not
appear to be widely productive in Duna and is mostly limited to the semantic domain
of kin and peer terms.
     Kin and peer compounds are formed from two nouns that describe types of
people, generally those that are of an equivalent generation and opposite gender (for
example, mother-father). These correspond to Anderson’s typology of ‘parallel’
coordinate compounds (1985:50).
     Some common compounds of this type are shown in Table 5.1. The meaning
of the resultant term does not transparently describe the combination of two indi-
viduals. For example the term ima-anoa ‘woman-man’ is used to mean ‘person,
people’, not ‘a man and a woman’. Similarly kheni-khane ‘male’s brother-cross-sex
sibling’ can be used as a generic term ‘sibling’ referring to the siblings of both men
and women (see, for example, (225) in §5.3.3.3), despite the fact that kheni as an
individual term only refers to male siblings of males.
     Compound terms show elision at the boundary of two vowels (see for example
ima-anoa ‘people’), and this together with intonation suggests they are a single
word. In some compounds there is a significant phonemic difference between the
independent words and their compound form, for example the loss of the final syl-
lable of imane ‘girl’ in imanane, an example of haplology. In some compounds the
nouns are less tightly bound; for example the ordering of the elements ingini ‘son’
and wane ‘daughter’ in ‘offspring’ is not fixed, as both inginiwane and wanengini
occur in the textual data with no discernable difference in meaning.11 This flexibil-
ity is more characteristic of productive collocation of separate nouns (§5.4.1) rather
than word formation. This is in contrast to imanane ‘children’, which is a fixed
term, and cannot be substituted with naneimane (or similar).
     A few other lexicalised ‘natural kind’ collocations are also attested in the data,
comprising two nouns that function as a unit without being pair-marked (§5.4.1).
  11
       Of 36 instances of the two terms in texts, inginiwane occurred 26 times and wanengini 10 times.

"9.2.2.3     Current or previous time
Personal evidential markers are specified as to whether the evidence is being cur-
rently experienced (the perception event is simultaneous to the speech event), or
was previously experienced but is no longer within the perceptual sphere of the dis-
course participants (the perception event is prior to the speech event).8 A formal
distinction between the two categories is that evidential markers that are specified
as previous occur in non-final clauses marked with the subordinator -ko (see for ex-
ample (1012)), whereas morphemes that are specified as current do not. In order to
understand examples presented in this thesis, it is important to note that in extended
narratives, perception event time reference typically reflects narrative-external time
of utterance, even though the evidential category reflects narrative-internal evid-
ence; see for example (760).
    A formal distinction between current and previous evidence is a feature of the
evidentiality area of which Duna is part (see Loughnane and San Roque forthcom-
ing).9 This kind of contrast has been treated in various ways, for example Rule
(1977:72) identifies the primary distinction in Foe as being between ‘visible evid-
ence’, that which is “evidence before the speaker”, and ‘previous evidence’, which
has been seen but is no longer present. I regard such distinctions as commensurate
   8
     Giles (MSa) generally describes evidential markers that I term ‘previous’ forms as ‘report’
forms, because the speaker is typically reporting something they now know to an addressee.
   9
     It is worth pointing out there is something of a correlation between the notion of current vs
previous evidence and individual vs collective viewpoint as outlined in §9.2.2.2. As a general rule,
evidence that is current is likely to be something that is shared between speaker and hearer; for
example, if I can currently hear something, the chances are that you, my interlocutor, can hear it
too. However, this relationship is uncoupled somewhat in certain ‘private evidence’ situations; for
example, if I tell you that I currently feel feverish, there is little expectation that you will be sharing
my sensory experience.
312                              Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
with the current/previous distinction that I describe for Duna.
     Elsewhere in the world, evidential systems in which the time of the perception
event in relation to the time of utterance is a particular concern are that of Sherpa
(Woodbury 1986) and Matses (Fleck 2003 2007). For example, Woodbury iden-
tifies the basic evidential value of the Sherpa verbal inflection -nok as specifying
‘immediate evidence’ (1986:195). This form is used to indicate that the speaker’s
evidence for the truth of the proposition is obtained or obtainable in the present (re-
gardless of whether the proposition is itself specified as present or past tense), and
relates in this regard to Duna current evidential markers.
     In Matses, the expression of an ‘inferential’ information source in independent
sentences is formalised in two different ways according to whether the resultat-
ive evidence of the inferred event is currently perceived by the speaker, or is “no
longer discernible”. In situations where “the report of an event ... [is] contem-
poraneous with the detection of the evidence ... [or] take[s] place while beholding
the evidence” (roughly equivalent to the context in which Duna ‘current’ eviden-
tials are used), a single inferential inflection is applied to the verb. This inflection
also encodes a three-way past tense distinction (‘recent’, ‘distant’, or ‘remote’). An
example of the recent past inferential is shown in (742).10(742)    şhëktenamë          kuen-ak.
         white.lipped.peccary pass.by-REC . PAST: INF
         ‘White-lipped peccaries (evidently) passed by (here).’ [said looking at fresh
         tracks] (M ATSES Fleck 2007:599)    If the speaker makes the report when he or she no longer beholds this evidence
(roughly equivalent to the context in which Duna ‘previous’ evidentials are used),
then the inferential inflection is applied in combination with a following ‘direct ex-
perience’ evidential/tense inflection. This is exemplified in (743) and (744). This
kind of construction marks what Fleck terms ‘double tense’. Both inflections are
marked for recent or distant past tense, but in reference to different temporal points.
The inferential inflection (applied first) relates the narrated event to the time of the
perception event, for example indicating that something happened a short while be-
fore the results of it were observed, as in these two examples. The direct experience
inflection (applied second) alternatively relates the perception event to the utterance
event, indicating for example that evidence was observed a short time prior to the
utterance, as in (743), or a long time prior to the time of utterance, as in (744).","[340, 341]"

     There are a few recorded instances of an (older) speaker producing sa- ‘take, get’ with an initial
palatalised stop [thj ] or fricative [sj ], suggesting that the verbs may at one time have been segmentally
distinct.

Duna has a closed class of existential verbs that can predicate the existence or loc-
ation of someone or something. An existential verb can perform an ‘existential-
classificatory’ function (Rumsey 2002), as different kinds of entities require differ-
ent verbs of existence (§4.1.2.3). The existential verbs also have lexically specific
meanings (for example describing a posture) and grammatical or aspectual mean-
ings in complex structures. The use of a set of verbs that can have either existential
or non-existential meaning, and function (more or less rigorously) as a covert classi-
fication system, is well attested in other languages of New Guinea (see, for example,
Lang 1975; Foley 1986:88-90; Rumsey 2002; Corris 2005:215-6), and elsewhere.9
Clauses headed by existential verbs in Duna can be ‘expanded’ to express possess-
ive relationships (§7.5.5.1).
     Duna existential verbs are listed in Table 3.6. Typical characteristics of an ex-
istential subject argument for each verb are shown in the table. I refer to the top
three verbs as ‘major’ existential verbs, as they are used to describe the existence
and/or location of a wide range of things, and existential/locative predication is one
of their primary functions.10 The lower section of the table lists ‘minor’ existential
verbs, for which the class of appropriate ‘be-ers’ is very limited. These are only
rarely used with existential/locative function.
     Giles (MSa) discusses the use of the three major existential verbs in some detail,
and I reproduce her description of the three-way classification system here, as I find
it very informative and largely agree with her original analysis. In this passage Giles
refers to the verbs using their stative forms, kei (= ka- ‘be/stand’), rei (= ra- ‘be/sit’),
and iri (= (e)ra ‘be/put’).
   9
      See for example Hellwig’s (2006) in-depth semantic analysis of postural/existential verbs in
Goemai (West Chadic).
   10
      In this thesis I conventionally gloss the major existential verbs as ka- ‘be/stand’, ra- ‘be/sit’,
and era ‘be/put’. I do not feel it is possible at this stage to maintain a meaningful gloss distinction
between different senses and functions that can be consistently applied to all occurrences of the verbs
in the language examples.

includes adult males and also larger creatures such as pigs, cassowaries and dogs
(regardless of their sex). The designation ‘body parts’ includes internal organs as
well as limbs and other body parts. The rei (‘be/sit’) class includes squat or broad
items, female humans, and smaller creatures such as possums, birds, and most in-
sects.12 The iri (‘be/put’) class also includes other crawling creatures such as grubs
and is used for more abstract items such as words, songs and customs.","[105, 106, 107]"
"8.2.4.2    Prohibitive
The prohibitive suffix -wei occurs on regular verbs to tell an addressee to stop
doing something, or not begin an activity that it appears they are about to do.26 Two

          ‘Do not suppress and then abandon me.’ (T/SN:101203i)    The prohibitive suffix attaches to the o-base of consonantal verbs as shown

inflection, as shown in (699).
  25
      Comrie (2003) discusses the fact that full or partial suppletion of a verb ‘give’ with respect to
the person of the recipient is quite a widespread phenomenon in the world’s languages, even in those
languages that (like Duna) do not generally show any object or indirect object agreement on verb.
   26
      König and Siemund (2007:308-311) note that the presence of a prohibitive marker, that is, a
morpheme that is specific to negative directives and occurs on sentences that are not otherwise
marked as negative, is a comparatively infrequent phenomena cross-linguistically. Out of their
sample of 70 languages only four had special prohibitive morphology of this kind.
   27
      There is probably a phonological basis for this: Several inflections outlined in this section are
marked on regular verbs by suffixes that are not consonant-intial but start with a labialised and/or
rounded glide or vowel, probably derived from the initial bilabial of the verb wa- ‘do’. These suffixes
attach to the o-base of consonantal verbs, or alternatively appear in the surface form to be directly
affixed to the base consonant. The exception to this is the suffix wayeni, see §8.2.4.4, for which the
base form varies.
