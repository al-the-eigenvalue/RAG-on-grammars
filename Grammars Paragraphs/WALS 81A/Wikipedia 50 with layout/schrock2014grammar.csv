Ik exhibits a strict VSO constituent order in basic unmarked main clauses.
This puts it in a ‘word-order’ typological category with Ancient Egyptian, a
few Chadic languages, much of Eastern Sudanic (notably Eastern Nilotic),
and possibly some Berber and other Afroasiatic languages (Creissels
2000:252). It distinguishes it from other regional languages like Dhaasanac
(SOV) and Dime (SOV). Though Teso-Turkana languages are classified as
VSO, a VOS order is also common (Dimmendaal 1983:68). But VOS is not
attested in Ik. Like some of the controversially analyzed VSO languages in
Africa, Ik exhibits both VSO and SVO constituent orders. However, in Ik,
SVO is restricted to subordinate clauses, which are described below in §9.4.",[511]
"
These two sentences illustrates that even with accusative marking, the order
of subject and object cannot be reversed. At least synchronically, constituent
order is fixed enough to prevent any hypothetical ambiguity arising from
case ‘defectiveness’. So the split-accusativity of Ik cannot be based only on a
need to make up for a failure in subject cross-referencing on the verb.",[306]
"
As noted in the Case Overview (§6.1), Ik is classified as a split-accusative
language due to this type of number-based differential object marking.
While this is the descriptive fact, can any explanation be offered for it?
Some attempts can be made, though none are conclusive. König suggests
that accusative marking comes into play when cross-referencing ‘fails’ on
the verb (2008:85). That is, if the subject is not cross-referenced on the
verb, case is needed to show grammatical relations. But this explanation
falls short on two accounts: 1) First, clausal constituent order is not flexible
enough to admit the kind of ambiguity implied by König’s analysis. 2) The
‘failure’ of cross-reference (i.e. a zero morpheme) is in itself cross-reference.
274
Even if a 3SG subject is not cross-referenced—or is so with zero marking—
constituent order would tell a speaker what the subject and object were:
(128)   Cea ama idemek.
        cɛ-a            ám-á             ídeme-kᵃ
        kill-REAL       person- NOM      snake- ACC
        A person kills a snake.","[305, 306]"
"
A ‘basic clause’ is defined here is a simple, declarative statement with a 3SG
subject, realis modality, and positive polarity—in other words, functionally
and semantically unmarked. As noted above, the order of core constituents
480
in an Ik basic clause is VSO, or more precisely, VS in intransitive clauses and
VAO in transitive clauses. In (30) below, the noun ŋókᵃ ‘dog’ is functioning
as the subject of the intransitive predicate ep- ‘sleep’. And in (31), the same
noun is acting as the subject of the transitive predicate átsʼ- ‘gnaw’ with ɔká-
‘bone’ as its object. Note how the subject follows the verb in each example,
and how the object follows the subject in (31):
(30)    Epa ŋok.
        ep-aV          ŋók-ᵃS             Intransitive=VS
        sleep-REAL dog-NOM
        The dog is asleep.","[511, 512]"
"
The basic, unmarked constituent order of Ik main clauses is VSO (VS/VAO),
but SVO is attested in subordinate clauses. In a main clause, the verb comes
first, followed by a tense clitic (if present) and then the subject and object(s)
if explicitly mentioned (both subjects and objects may be left implicit in Ik.)
Peripheral arguments come next, followed by any adverbs.",[52]
"
The constituent order within the relative clauses themselves also departs
from that of unmarked main clauses. After the relative pronoun, then comes
the subject (if mentioned) and the verb followed by any other overtly
mentioned core arguments, peripheral arguments, adverbs, etc., making the
RC constituent orders as follows: (rel)(S)V for intransitive clauses and
(rel)(A)V(O) for transitive clauses.",[534]
"
Apart from ones with sequential verbs like in (75), all other subordinate
clauses in Ik have an SVO consituent order—SV for intransitive and AVO for
transitive. This SVO order recalls the Surmic language Tennet which also
has a VSO order in main clauses but SV in intransitive subordinate clauses
(Dimmendaal 2010:33). And like in Dhaasanac (Tosco 2001:14) and Teso-
Turkana languages, many subordinate clauses in Ik have the structure of a
relative clause, with the subordinating conjunction being based on relative
pronouns. For example, in the next two sentences, the conjunction noo
introducing them is identical to the remote past relative pronoun. Note the
respective constituent orders in these two temporal dependent clauses:
494
(76)    Noo ŋokia epad,...
        [noo         ŋókí-aS        ep-á=dᵉV]TEMP…               INTRANSITIVE =SV        CONJ.PST3    dog-ACC        sleep-REAL=DP
        When the dog was sleeping,…","[525, 526]"
"
Ik’s VSO constituent order along with its total lack of synchronically
functional prefixes is one of its ‘remarkable’ typological properties (Heine &
König 1996:123). This property, along with the subordinate clause SVO
contituent order, suggests that VSO may be a wholesale syntactic structure
replicated from the historically influential Eastern Nilotic languages.",[511]
"
9.5.1 Auxiliary verbs proper
The auxiliary verbs ‘proper’ are lexical verbs in their own right but also
double as aspectual auxiliaries. In the Ik auxiliary verb construction, the
aspectual auxiliary fills the slot for the main verb and is the only verb
marked for subject-agreement, tense, and polarity. The semantic main verb
follows in a morphologically defective form. If the clause subject is overt, it
comes between the auxiliary and the main verb, making the constituent
order of auxiliarized clauses Aux-S-V or Aux-A-V-O, the same order found in
                                                                                  485
subordinate clauses. The only inflection found on the main verb in an
auxiliary construction is the realis suffix {-a}. It remains thus, regardless of
the various inflectional suffixes the auxiliary verb may take.","[516, 517]"
"
The sentence in (98) is a version of (99) below in which the subject has
been put into special focus for pragmatic or stylistic reasons. (99) represents
the unmarked constituent order for the same proposition.",[534]
"
On a continuum between coordination and subordination, sequential clauses
are more coordinative. This is reflected syntactically in their invariable VSO
constituent order and canonical case marking, both characteristics of
unmarked main clauses. The next examples—the first a non-past realis
clause and the second a sequential clause—both have VAO order with
nominative-marked subjects and accusative-marked objects:
                                                                                         569
(18)    Ceesa ntsa riyek.                              Ceyoo ntsa riyek.
        cɛ-ɛs-áV            nts-aA   rié-kᵃO           cɛ-ɪ-ɔV        nts-aA   rié-kᵃO
        kill-INT-REAL       he-NOM goat- ACC           kill-3S-SEQ he-NOM goat-ACC
        He’ll kill the goat.                           And he killed the goat.","[600, 601]"
"
9.8.3 Relative clause structure
Relative clauses in Ik always immediately follow the CA in the main clause,
regardless of constituents before the main clause or after the relative clause.
Normally, the order of constituents in a main clause is VS or VAO, but when
the CA is the subject of the main clause, it can be fronted and then followed
by the relative clause and the main verb, making the constituent order SV or
AVO. This can be seen in (92) above as well as in the following:
502
(98)    Ama na cea basaurek, isokuk.
        [ám-á=[na                 cɛ-a       basaúré-kᵃ]RC ‖ isók-ú-kᵒ]MC
        person-NOM=REL.SG         kill-REAL eland-ACC          go.early-3SG-SEQ
        The person who kills an eland goes early (i.e. before others).","[533, 534]"
"
(7)     Na feta nƙetoo bia,…
        na=fet-aA          ŋƙ-ɛ́t-ɔ-ɔ            bi-a
        CONJ =sun-NOM eat-INCH-3SG-SEQ           you.SG-ACC
        If you get thirsty,… (lit. ‘If the sun starts eating you,…)
But subjects (A/S) of all other types of subordinate clauses take the
accusative case. In such clauses, the constituent order is SV/AVO, a
deviation from the language’s unmarked VS/VAO order. For yet unknown
reasons, Ik syntax marks preverbal subjects (with the above exceptions of
sequential subordinate clauses) with the accusative case, as in:
(8)     Noo ncia kwatsiyaad,…
        noo         ɲ́ci-aS    kwáts-í-í-a=dᵉ
        CONJ.PST3   I-ACC      small-PLUR-1SG- REAL=DP
        When I was small,…",[266]
"
Complement clauses (§9.13.1), though subordinate themselves, make
another exception to the SVO order. Since they are embedded main clauses,
they retain the VSO constituent order of non-embedded main clauses. Such
clauses are introduced by the complementizer toimɛna/toimɛnɪ- ‘that’, which,
since it is a noun and argument of the matrix clause, takes case suffixes:
(78)    Hyeiyaa toimena epa ŋok.
        ɦye-í-á          toimɛn-a      [ep-aV        ŋók-ᵃS ]COMPL
        know-1SG-REAL COMPL-NOM sleep-REAL dog-NOM
        I know that the dog is sleeping.",[526]
"Schröder, Helga (2008). Word Order in Toposa: An Aspect of Multiple Feature-
    Checking. SIL International and The University of Texas at Arlington.",[729]
"
In (75), the conjunction nɑ= ‘if’ fills the syntactic verbal slot (V), while cɛɪɔ,
the clause’s real verb, is ‘co’-subordinate to it (V2). In this way, sequential
subordinate clauses attempt to preserve surface-level VSO order, although
there is a mismatch between deep and surface structure. This analysis tries
to account for why an otherwise preverbal subject is in the nominative case,
when all other preverbal subjects in the language take accusative case:
(75)    Na soreima ceyoo poposaa...
        [na=]Vsoré-ím-aA              cɛ-ɪ-ɔV2    pɔpɔsa-áO
        CONJ =boy-child-NOM           kill-3SG-SEQ lizard-ACC
        If a boy kills a lizard,...",[525]
"
Moving on to compound structure: Compounds reverse the normal noun
phrase word order in which modifiers follow the heads they modify. In
compounds, the modifier appears as N1 followed by the head as the N2.
                                                                            175
Take the compound in (69), for instance, where the noun dakú- ‘tree’ is used
as the modifying N1. Then compare the word order of the compound with
that of a normal noun phrase having the same meaning:
(69)    Compound versus noun phrase
        dakúMOD-ɓɔ́lHEAD       ɓɔ́láHEAD   dakwíMOD
        tree-shin:NOM          shin:NOM tree:GEN
        ‘tree trunk’           ‘trunk of the tree’
As a third structural feature, compounds involve a special case marking: The
N1 takes the oblique case while the N2 takes whatever case the syntax
requires for the whole construction. In the oblique case, the form of the N1
is usually an exact representation of its underlying lexical form. An
exception to this statement is that a noun ending in a VV sequence will lose
its final vowel when joined to another noun in a compound. In the following
examples, the noun bubuu- ‘belly’ is compounded with aƙɔ́- ‘interior’.
Observe that the final vowel of bubuu- is lost and that only the case of the
N2, aƙɔ́-, changes with different clausal argument structures:
(70)    Doda bubuaƙw.
        dód-a          bubu-aƙw-ᵃ
        hurt-REAL      belly[OBL]-interior-NOM
        (My) inner belly hurts.","[206, 207]"
"
But there are also instances where the syntax of subordinate clauses
rearranges the usual order of clausal constituents. Temporal subordinate
clauses in Ik have the form of a relative clause (§9.9.1), and Ik time
expressions are often encoded in the instrumental case (i.e. as a non-core
argument). These two factors combined mean that a temporal subordinate
clause without an overt time word marks its verb with the DP. This is
because the syntax is interpreting the temporal conjunction as a relative
pronoun whose common argument is peripheral argument that in fact does
not exist. So in the following two examples, the DP is present on the verb to
show that the missing argument—a time expression—is accounted for:
(66)    Noo kwatsiad,...
        noo         kwáts-í-á=dᵉ
        CONJ.PST3   small-1SG-REAL=DP
        When I was small,…",[260]
"
Semantically, the prototypical Ik noun refers to inanimate and animate
objects, people, and places—anything in the world that is viewed as an
inherent non-event. However, the boundary between things named by
nouns and events named by verbs is fuzzy. Many lexical event concepts can
become nouns with noun morphology or verbs with verb morphology, e.g.:
(1)     Lexemes ambiguously nominal or verbal
        botá-      ‘migrate’            ƙɔ́ɗɛ́-     ‘cry’
        cooka-     ‘shepherd’           ɔfa-        ‘cough’
        deƙu-      ‘quarrel’            sáɡo-       ‘snare’
        ɗɔanɪ ́-   ‘weed’               sʊpa-       ‘breathe’
        epú-       ‘sleep’              taatsa-     ‘pay’
        féí-       ‘bathe’              taʝala-     ‘give up’
132
        fekí-      ‘laugh’               tɔkɔba-     ‘farm’
        ɪ ̯ana-    ‘talk’                tɔkɔra-     ‘distribute’
        ɪƙɪra-     ‘write’               tɔlɔka-     ‘trap’
        ɪrɛʝa-     ‘slash grass’         tɛwɛa-      ‘broadcast seed’
        iruɓa-     ‘chew hard foods’     tóda-       ‘speak’
        isira-     ‘decorate’            tsuwaa-     ‘run’
        ɪtsɪka-    ‘order’               wáána-      ‘pray’
        ɪwara-     ‘plaster’             waté-       ‘rain’
        ƙaƙa-      ‘hunt’                zɛƙɔ́-      ‘sit/stay’
Ik nominal morphology is minimal—four being the maximum number of
morphemes a single noun can have (outside of compounds). Compare this to
Turkana nouns which may have up to eleven morphemes (Dimmendaal
1983:208)ǃ Any Ik noun in a post-lexical grammatical context consists
minimally of a lexical root plus a case marker. Besides the case marker, the
only other nominal suffixes are number and possession markers. The order
in which these occur is ROOT-(NUMBER)-(POSSESSION)- CASE. Unlike Turkana
and Dhaasanac, Ik has no grammatical gender marked on nouns. Ik
compensates for its minimal noun inflection by joining nouns and pronouns
together in a variety of compounds. Thus, meanings expressed by affixes in
other languages are expressed by a compound construction in Ik.","[163, 164]"
"
A complex sentence like this one embodies the language’s full-fledged
morphological case-marking system. In addition to word order and
connectives like ńda ‘with’, Ik uses this case system to mark grammatical
relations and encode semantic roles in an integral and efficient manner.
232
6.1     Case overview
        “The case marking typology of a language is surely its most central
        typological parameter, since almost all other parts of the grammar
        must interact with it.”—Talmy Givón, quoted by Serzisko (1992:50)
All Ik nominals must be inflected for case, and formal parallels of nominal
case markers are found in other diverse parts of the grammar. Due to its
grammatical centrality, the Ik case system has already been the subject of
several works (e.g. Heine 1990, König 2002, König 2008, and Schrock
2014). As König defines it, “a case system is an inflexional system of
marking nouns or noun phrases for the type of relationship they bear to
their heads… expressed by affixes, tone, accent shift, or root reduction…”
(2008:5). Out of the above list, Ik uses a combination of affixes and stem
reduction to encode case relations. The affixes are suffixes, and stem
reduction means the stem-final vowel is deleted before some case suffixes.","[263, 264]"
"
9.11.1 Cleft construction
Ik cleft constructions consist of a clefted clausal argument in the copulative
case followed by the original main clause now in a subordinated form. As
indicated by the copulative case marking, the Ik cleft construction takes the
form of a verbless copula clause (§9.10.1) in which the copula complement
(CC) is the clefted argument and the copula subject (CS) is the original, now
subordinate main clause. It can be formulated as follows:
(150)   Ik cleft construction:      [NP-COP]CC [SUBORD]CS
The following pair of sentences exemplify the Ik cleft construction. The first
example is a pragmatically unmarked basic clause with the canonical word
order for transitive clauses (VAO). In the second example, the direct object
of the clause, mɛsɛ- ‘beer’, gets clefted and put in the copulative case. The
original main verb, bɛ́ɗɪ́m, then assumes its role as the predicate in a
subordinate clause acting as the subject of the verbless clause mɛsɔɔ:
(151)   Beɗima mes.
        bɛ́ɗ-ɪ ́m-aVA            mɛs-∅O
        want-1PL.EXC-REAL        beer-NOM
        We want beer.
522
(152)   Mesoo beɗim.
        mɛsɔ-ɔCC     [bɛ́ɗ-ɪ ́m-∅VA ∅O]CS
        beer-COP     want-1PL.EXC-REAL
        It’s beer (that) we want.","[553, 554]"
"
In (20), the first chained simultaneous clause, ikáá iie kíʝée ‘his head (being)
down’ is controlled by the directly preceding clause with the nominalized
verb ʃɪ́kɛ́sʊƙɔtᶦˊ. The second chained clause, tuɗúlíkᵉ, consists only of the verb
and is controlled by the simultaneous clause directly preceding it.
                                                                                 571
On a continuum between coordination and subordination, simultaneous
clauses fall closer to subordination. This is evident syntactically in that a)
they exhibit the SVO constituent order of other subordinate clauses and b)
any overt core arguments, regardless of the grammatical person and number
of the subject, take the accusative case as in other subordinate clauses. The
third line from (20) is repeated in (21) to illustrate these points. Note that
the constituent order is SV, and the overt subject, ikáá ‘head’ is both
preverbal and marked in the accusative case:
(21)    ...ikaa iyie kiʝee,
        iká-áS        i-i-eV       kíʝé-ePERIPHERAL
        head-ACC      be-3SG- SIML ground-DAT
        ...(his) head (being) down,
The subordinate nature of simultaneous chained clauses is also seen
discursively in that they take the sequence of events temporarily ‘offline’.
For example, in a narrative, they interrupt the mainline to provide
contextual details like the fact that the guy’s headed was hanging down,
upside-down. To get back to the mainline sequence, a pre-posed
simultaneous clause is often used. This occurs a few lines later in the story
of (20), after the man’s wife got worried and went to look for him:
(22)    Na ƙayie, itayoo amee inenoosik.
        [na=ƙa-i-e]ADV         ɪta-ɪ-ɔ           ámé-e     [inénó-ós-í-kᵉ]SIML
        CONJ =go-3SG-SIML      reach-3SG-SEQ     person-DAT hang-PASS-3SG-SIML
        When she went, she found the guy hanging.","[602, 603]"
"
4.3.1 Formal properties
As a noun-building strategy, Ik compounding involves joining two or more
(pro)nominal elements together in an associative construction with special
formal and semantic characteristics. The formal characteristics include the
172
following: 1) a phonological word profile with inter-nominal vowel
harmony, 2) a tone melody applying over the whole compound rather than
its individual elements, 2) a reversed word order—modifier before head—
where head before modifier is the norm elsewhere, and 3) a unique case
marking whereby the first noun (N1) take the oblique case and the second
noun (N2) takes whatever case the syntax requires for the whole compound.
These formal features show that the construction cannot be called mere
‘juxtaposition’ as it has been in the literature (e.g. Heine & König 1996:35).","[203, 204]"
"
Lastly, Ik nominal demonstratives—spatial, temporal, and anaphoric—are
not mutually exclusive. They can occur singly or in combination with one or
two other types. This is possible because they all have different functions,
indicating the location, place in time, and discourse topicality, respectively,
of their referents. Whichever types coincide in one noun phrase, the order in
which they occur is: NP.HEAD=(anaphoric)=(spatial/temporal)=(spatial):
440
(33)    Cooccuring nominal demonstratives
        ámá=ꜜdéé                 ‘that person (already mentioned)’
        ámá=nakᵃ                 ‘that person (from earlier)’
        ámá=na                   ‘this person’
        ámá=ꜜdéé=naa             ‘that person (mentioned, from earlier)’
        ámá=ꜜdéé=na              ‘this person (already mentioned)’
        ámá=ꜜdéé=náa=ne          ‘that person (there, mentioned, earlier)
        ámá=ke=náa=ke            ‘that person (over there, from earlier)’
8.2.4 Locative adverbial demonstratives
In addition to nominal demonstratives that point to objects, and anaphoric
demonstratives that point to known information, Ik also has several locative
adverbial demonstratives that point to a place. These also include deictics
and anaphorics. The deictics comprise a three-term system distinguishing
proximal, medial, and distal distances, just like nominal demonstratives. The
anaphorics     include two   demonstratives that     refer to    a place    or
metaphorically to a time already known from the discourse context.","[471, 472]"
"
9.8.2 Relative pronouns
Relative clauses in Ik can be recognized by three criteria: 1) the intonation
contour in which the MC and RC are treated as one sentence prosodically,
2) the presence of relative pronouns at the beginning of the RC, and 3) the
non-canonical constituent order within the RC. The particles introducing
relative clauses are treated here as relative ‘pronouns’ instead of ‘markers’
since they are not invariable and do communicate some information,
namely the grammatical number of the common argument and the tense of
the relative clause. These Ik relative pronouns are already discussed in §5.6
but warrant further mention here as well. The table below presents the
relative pronouns according to number and tense:
(95)    Ik relative pronouns
                     Singular     Plural
        NON-PAST     =na          =ni
        PST1         =náa         =níi
        PST2         =sɪna        =sini
        PST3         =nɔɔ         =nuu
The relative pronouns are analyzed as enclitics because they form a
phonological word with the preceding noun (evidenced by the post-lexical
vowel harmony they participate in). And based on the forms in (95), it is
evident that the Ik relative pronouns are closely related to the temporal
                                                                                 501
nominal demonstratives (see §8.2.2). Quite so, they are identical in form,
the only difference being that since relative pronouns never appear clause-
finally, they consequently do not have final forms. Like the demonstratives

5.1.4 Bound personal pronouns
The Ik bound personal pronouns are verbal suffixes. For this reason, they
are also treated under §7.4, where their verbal properties are discussed.
They have the same person and number distinctions as their free
                                                                            207
counterparts. They are viewed as suffixes because 1) they cannot stand
alone as a word, and 2) they can be preceded or followed by other verbal
suffixes (unlike most clitics). Their grammatical function is to cross-
reference the subject of the clause. (9) presents the Ik bound personal
pronouns in the unmarked [-ATR] and marked [+ATR] allomorphs:
(8)     Ik bound pronominal suffixes
                   [-ATR]       [+ATR]
        1SG        -ɪ ́ɪ ́      -íí
        2SG        -ɪ ́dɪ       -ídi
        3SG        -ɪ           -i
        1PL.EXC    -ɪ ́mɪ ́     -ímí
        1PL.INC    -ɪ ́sɪ ́nɪ   -ísíni
        2PL        -ɪ ́tɪ ́     -ítí
        3PL        -áti         —
A few comments are in order for the forms in (8). First, the 2SG pronominal
suffix {-ɪ ́dɪ} has the tone melody HL due to the presence of the depressor
consonant /d/. Depending on the verb stem it attaches to, it can surfaces as
LL but never as HH. Along the same lines, the 3PL suffix {-áti-} also has a HL
tone melody. It can surface as LL but never as HH. Although it does not
contain a depressor consonant currently, it seems quite likely that the /t/ in
{-áti-} has developed historically from /d/ as in *-ádi. This cannot be
proven, but such a development would help explain the HL tone melody.
The 3PL suffix is also dominantly [+ATR] as described back in §3.1.3.","[238, 239]"
"
Another defining property of Ik subordinate clauses is that all core
arguments (A/S/O) are marked with the accusative case. Again, this is
similar to Tennet, where main clauses have a nominative-accusative case-
marking system, while in dependent clauses, this switches to ergative-
absolutive (Dimmendaal 2010:33). Also in this connection, the Saharan
language Tubu, which has Differential Object Marking, an object is more
likely to be marked accusative if not expressed in its normal position (König
                                                                               495
2008:40, cited in Dimmendaal 2010:32). In other words, accusative case is
reserved for pragmatically marked positions. So in Ik, the accusative
marking on subjects (A/S) may have something to do with the subject being
in a pragmatically marked slot, that is, before the verb. The next two
examples illustrate this with intransitive (80) and transitive (81) clauses:
(80)    Noo ncia epiaade kuru,...
        [noo         ɲ́ci-aS    ep-í-á=deV              kurú-∅]TEMP
        CONJ.PST3    I-ACC      sleep-1SG-REAL=DP shade-ABL
        When I slept in the shade,…","[526, 527]"
"
Ik employs eight cases to encode grammatical relations between verbs and
their arguments, or between arguments and modifiers (genitive). In König’s
African case typology, Ik is a Type 2 split-accusative system in which both the
nominative and accusative cases are marked (2008:10). It is ‘accusative’ in
that when core clausal arguments are marked differently from each other, S
and A take the nominative case, while O takes the accusative case. And it is
‘split’ in that this accusativity only occurs when the subject (A) is third
person. The objects (O) of first and second person subjects (A/S) take the
nominative case. And when a subject (A/S) is preposed before the verb, for
example in most types of subordinate clauses, it also takes the accusative.
(2)      1/2 person subjects             3 person subjects
        A                O               A                   O   ACC                S            NOM                  S   NOM
                                                                         233
Blake defines case as a typical system of “marking the relationship of a noun
to a verb at the clause level or of a noun to a preposition, postposition or
another noun at the phrase level” (1994:1). True to this definition, Ik case
encodes the grammatical relations between a verb and its core arguments
and any non-core arguments. And though in Ik the genitive case can mark
arguments for some verbs, its main function is to mark the relationship
between a noun phrase and a possessive nominal modifier.","[264, 265]"
"
In most types of Ik subordinate clauses, any overt subject comes before the
verb in the ACC case, and any overt direct object follows the verb, also in the
ACC case. (197) shows the passive clause in (195) as a complement to theverbless copulative clause isio ‘It is what... (i.e. ‘why?’)’. In the subordinate
complement clause, the word asak ‘door’ is put before the verb, indicating
that it is viewed as the syntactic subject (S) of (197). If asak is put after the
verb, as if it were an object, the result is ungrammatical (198). The same
process is seen taking place between (196) and (199)-(200) as in:
(197)   Isio asakaa kokosad?
        isi-o        ásaka-a        kɔk-ɔ́s-á=dᵉ
        what-COP     door-ACC       close-PASS-REAL=DP
        Why is the door closed?",[420]
"
Lastly, for extended transitive verbs, the original transitive subject (A)
becomes the direct object (O), while the original direct object becomes the
484
first extended object (E1) marked with the dative case. And the original
extended object (E1) becomes the second extended object (E2), also in the
dative case. This construction puts Ik in the company of the relatively few
languages worldwide—like Japanese, Turkish, and Kamaiurá—that allow
more than one dative noun phrase in the same clause (Dixon 2012:264):
(46)    Maƙotiaa nka kaudza konie amae.
        ma-ƙot-í-a-a             [ŋk-a]A [kaúdz-a]O [kɔnɪ-ɛ       ámá-ᵉ]E1
        give-AND-1SG -REAL-PRF   I-NOM   money-NOM one-DAT        person-GEN
        I have given the money to another person.","[515, 516]"
"
If a quantifier cooccurs with either a possessive phrase or a demonstrative in
an NP, the quantifer comes last in the sequence, for example:
(8)     ŋokitina ncie gai
        [ŋók-ítín-á [ɲ́ci-e]NP:POSS      ꜜɡáí]NP
        dog-PL-NOM I-GEN                 both
        both my dogs
(9)     ŋokitina ni gai
        [ŋók-ítín-á=ni         ꜜɡáí]NP
        dog-PL-NOM DEM.PL both
        both these dogs
And if all three types of modifers are present, the following order obtains:
(10)    ŋokitina ncie ni gai ni
        [ŋók-ítín-á [ɲ́ci-e]NP:POSS=ni        ꜜɡáí =(ni)]NP
        dog-PL-NOM I-GEN=DEM.PL               both=DEM.PL
        both these dogs of mine (these)
474
Noun phrase heads may be modified by relative clauses (see §9.8 for a more
detailed treatment). These clauses also follow the NP head. They tend to fall
at the end of the NP, but quantifiers may optionally follow them:
(11)    dakwitina ncie gai ni dunaaket
        [dakw-itín-á     [ɲ́ci-e]NP:POSS ꜜɡáí=[ni           dun-aak-et-ᵃˊ]RC]NP
        tree-PL-NOM      I-GEN           both=REL.PL        old-DISTR-INCH-REAL
        both of my old trees
(12)    dakwitina ncie ni dunaaketa gai
        [dakw-itín-á     [ɲ́ci-e]NP:POSS =[ni       dun-aak-et-a]RC     ꜜɡáí]NP
        tree-PL-NOM      I-GEN=REL.PL               old-DISTR-INCH-REAL both
        both of my old trees
And when multiple adjectival verbs are used to describe a clausal argument,
only one relative clause structure is used. After the relative pronoun come
the two or more adjectivals, demarcated with a pause (‖) between each one:
(13)    dakwitina ncie ni dunaaket,
        [dakw-itín-á     [ɲ́ci-e]NP:POSS =[ní       dun-aak-et-∅ ‖

        all my old, tall, green trees
9.2     Possession
The following overview of ‘possession’ in Ik covers not only the possessive
constructions within in noun phrases, but also some of the broader issues
surrounding how ‘possession’ is syntactically encoded in the language.
                                                                             475
From a syntactic point of view, Ik employs three types of possessive
construction: 1) A possessee NP head followed by a possessor NP in the
genitive case, 2) a possessor noun and a possessee noun joined in a
compound, in that order. Ik speakers claim there is no difference in meaning
between these two types. 3) The third type of possessive construction is
complex. It consists of a compound with the possessor as the N1 and the
possessum morpheme ɛnɪ ́- as the N2. These two elements alone comprise a
possessive noun phrase, as in ɲj-ɛ́n ‘mine’. But then the possessee can be
specified by putting it in a genitive phrase after the NP head. This
construction can be termed ‘pertensive’ (Dixon 2010b:268), given that the
possessee bears the traditional marking for possessor (the genitive case):
(14)    NP possessive constructions
        1    awa ɲ́ci         home I:GEN                 ‘my home’
        2    ɲ́ci-aw          I:OBL-home                 ‘my home’
        3    ɲj-ɛ́ná awáᵉ   I[OBL]-PSSM home:GEN       ‘my home’
The types of semantic relationships that Ik possessive constructions can
express include those in (15)-(21). According to Dixon (2012b:263), Ik
would fall into that group of languages worldwide that shows a
comparatively wide range of such relationships:
(15)    Ownership:            nƙaƙa nti
                              ŋƙáƙá        ńtí-∅

                              their food
(16)    Whole-part:           riʝaaƙw
                              ríʝá-aƙw-ᵃ
                              forest[OBL]-inside-NOM
                              the inner (part of the) forest

                             the path of their companions
(21)    Nominalization:      arutetona ebae

                             the sound of a gunshot
Ik also uses verbal means to express possession. For example, the verbs tír-és
‘to hold’, i-on ‘to be’, and i-ona ńda ‘to be with’ are all common verbal
alternatives alongside the NP possessive constructions in (14). These verbs
used in this way often translate as ‘to have’. The first, tír-és, is a transitive
verb whose subject would be the possessor and object the possessee. Due to
its high degree of agency, this verb is restricted to human possessors:
                                                                          477
(22)    Tirida ɲakalama?
        tír-íd-a          ɲákalám-a
        hold-2SG-REAL     pen-NOM
        Do you have a pen (lit. ‘Are you holding a pen’)?","[505, 506, 507, 508, 509]"
"
Back to the grammatical functions of the accusative: Its second function is to
mark the overt subject (A/S) of any subordinate clause (except those with
sequential verb forms). In many subordinate clauses, the subject may be left
implicit, though it is always cross-referenced on the verb. When the subject
of a subordinate clause is explicit, it comes before the verb, as opposed to
after the verb like unmarked main clauses. Turkana is also a VSO language.
And it also marks its preverbal subjects with object case, which for it is the
‘absolutive’, the equivalent of the Ik accusative (Dimmendaal 1983:260).
                                                                                            277
The next three sentences below illustrate the accusative case marking and
preverbal syntactic position of subordinate clause subjects (A/S):
(133)   Naa ɲaɓalaŋitia iwiɗimetik,...
        náa      ɲaɓáláŋɪtɪ ́-áS         iwiɗ-ím-ét-i-kᵉ

"
(133)   Ogoyuo biti ati na.

The imperative verb in (132) is a fusion of two verbs, ƙa- ‘go’ and d-et-
‘bring’ that have been reanalyzed as a single verb. This is evident from
phrases spoken by children, like ƙáidetineˊ ‘Let me go-and-bring’. The object
of this transitive verb in (132) is ɗɪ in the oblique case. As for (133), both
the subject biti ‘you (pl.)’ and the object átí ‘filler word’ are in the oblique.","[390, 391]"
"
In Ik, a verb is a word whose primary grammatical function is to be the
head of the predicate. As head of the predicate, a verb can take a variety of
inflectional affixes, including those for subject agreement, mood, modality,
valency, and aspect. A secondary grammatical function of the Ik verb is to
be the head of a noun phrase. For a verb to adopt this function, it must first
be nominalized with one of the language’s several nominalizing suffixes.",[333]
"
Before leaving the topic of consonant-tone interaction, a comment is in
order about the ejectives /ƙ/ and /tsʼ/. While depressor consonants lower
pitch significantly, these ejectives raise pitch slightly. It seems that the
glottalic release of pressure of an ejective, accompanied by voicing in
114
following vowels, creates a slight rise in phonetic pitch. In the following
examples, the phonetic pitch notation is only approximate:
(56)    Enia ƙɔɓa ntsi.                                                en-í-aꜜ      ƙɔɓ-a       ntsí-∅
        see-1SG-REAL navel-NOM he-GEN
        I see his navel.","[145, 146]"
"
In the next example, it is the object of the main clause (komos) that is left-
dislocated. It is further highlighted by a substantial pause, which can be
discerned in the example by the presence of final form (no final vowel).
Note, however, that the left-dislocated object is not recapitulated in the
main clause. This is not surprising for two reasons: 1) Direct objects are not
cross-referenced on verbs like subjects are, and 2) Ik tends to drop subjects
and objects in all types of clauses (where they are understood contextually).",[556]
"
The verbal element of a complement clause can be nominalized instead of
appearing as a full finite verb. This is a commonly used complementation
strategy in Ik. Nominalized verbal complements can fill any core or non-
core argument slot and thus take any required case ending. If the subject of
the nominalized verb needs to be specified, for example if it differs from the
main clause subject, it directly follows the complement verb in the genitive
case. And if the nominalized verb is transitive, then its object also follows it
(and the subject) in the genitive case. This means that if the complement
clause is transitive and has a different subject than the matrix clause, the
nominalized verb may be followed by two nouns in the genitive case.",[570]
"
The dummy pronoun enclitic has a L tone on its vowel but a preceding
floating H tone. This floating H is posited on the basis of the H tone that
usually appears on the preceding tone-bearing unit. Since the /d/ in {=ˊdɛ}
is a depressor consonant, the floating H may have been lexicalized in order
to compensate for the depressing effect of the depressor consonant. The
dummy pronoun is a recessive morpheme that has the allomorph /=ˊde/
when attached to [+ATR] stems. The dummy pronoun is also subject to
                                                                        341
vowel assimilation, segment loss in non-final forms, and final-form
devoicing, giving it the numerous allomorphs presented in (82). The final-
form allomorphs, with devoiced vowels and segments, sound a lot like [t ̪].
And the allomorphs /=ˊɛ/ and /=ˊe/ have at times been confused with the
dative case non-final allomorph /ɛ,e/ (e.g. Heine & König 1996:25).","[372, 373]"
"
1.2.4 Vitality
In contrast to the other, endangered Kuliak (Rub) languages, Ik language is
still vital. According to the EGIDS scale (Simons & Lewis 2010), Ik is a level
6 ‘vigorous’, since “the language is used by all generations and the situation
is sustainable.” Small children are still learning it as their mother tongue
and typically remain monolingual for at least six years. After that, they may
begin to pick up English or Teso-Turkana from school and/or travels outside
Ikland. Ik young people face a subtle pressure to learn Teso-Turkana as a
language of wider communication. It is especially useful in trade, travel, and
simple physical survival. A fair number of Ik children attend primary
schools in towns and thus have to learn one of these languages in order to
learn from the teachers. But adding Teso-Turkana, English, or Swahili (in
Kenyan schools) to the repertoire of Ik youth has not so far diminished the
vitality of Ik in the homeland. There, Ik is still spoken in all domains of life,
with the exception of local community schools (if teachers are non-Ik) and
in Christian churches (with non-Ik songs or visiting non-Ik preachers).
26
But perhaps the more important indicator of Ik’s vitality is the positive
attitude the Ik have toward their language. It is a symbol of their ethnic
identity and solidarity. They revel in their ability to communicate in a
language that no outsider, including their long-time Teso-Turkana enemies,
can understand in the least. It is a rightful means of surviving and
subverting the oppression they have so often experienced.","[57, 58]"
"
Transitive verbs like cɛ- ‘kill’ take an object in the accusative case only when
the subject is 3-person. In (50), though, it is the intransitive auxiliary verb
ŋɔ́r- that is marked for 3-person, not cɛ-. Still, the object of the clause takes
the accusative case. This is because the semantic main verb (V), not the
auxiliary (AUX), governs the argument structure of the clause.",[518]
"
7.10 Adjectivals
Dixon asserts that every language has an adjectival word class, regardless of
how similar it may be to either nouns or verbs (2010:62). Cross-
linguistically, ‘adjectives’ tend to be distinguished as a distinct word class
based on relative similarities or differences between them and nouns or
verbs. The following diagram presents a typology of ‘adjectives’ in which
similarity and difference are modeled as spatial distance (Dixon 2010:66):
(237)   a)   NOUN                                      ADJECTIVE   VERB        b)   NOUN       ADJECTIVE                                  VERB        c)              NOUN         ADJECTIVE         VERB        d)   NOUN                    ADJECTIVE                     VERB
402
According to this typology, Ik is a type (a) language whose adjectives
exhibit many verb-like characteristics. So many that, despite Dixon’s
assertion, ‘adjectives’ are treated here as an ‘adjectival’ subset of intransitive
verbs instead of their own, separate word class. This is because,
morpologically and syntactically, they are just like other intransitive verbs.
Nonetheless, their semantics do cover categories traditionally handled by
adjectives, as shown below. And a handful of suffixes are found only on
‘adjectival’ verbs, also as described in the following sections.","[433, 434]"
"
The nominative case marks out the following five grammatical functions:
(58)    Nominative case grammatical functions
        1    The citation or isolation form of nouns.
        2    The subject (A/S) of indicative main clauses.
        3    The subject (A/S) of sequential subordinate clauses.
        4    The object (O) of transitive clauses with 1-2 person subjects.
        5    A fronted (left-dislocated or apposed) argument.",[286]

9.12.2 Content questions
Content questions in Ik involve clauses in which a constituent has been
replaced with an interrogative word. Unlike in some languages, only one
interrogative word per question is permitted in Ik. Ik Interrogative words—
see (179) below—include those corresponding to (and therefore standing in
place of) (pro)nouns, adverbs, and verbs. Besides the interrogative words
themselves, no other special morphological or intonational means are used.

(179) Ik interrogative words
        INTERROG           Meaning                                Word class
        ndo-               ‘who?’                                 (pro)noun
        ndaí-/ńtá          ‘where?’                               (pro)noun
        ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɪ ́-       ‘which (sg.)?’                         (pro)noun
        ńtí-ɛ́nɪ ́-        ‘which (pl.)?’                         (pro)noun
        ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɪ ́-/ńt-   ‘when (+specified unit of time)?’      (pro)noun
        isi-               ‘what?’                                (pro)noun
                           ‘why (with DAT or ABL case)?’          (pro)noun
        ńtí                ‘how?’                                 adverb
        kɪtɔ́ós-          ‘what quality (color, shape, etc.)?’   verb
        taná-              ‘how many?’                            verb
As can be seen from (179), most Ik interrogative words are (pro)nouns and
thus inflect fully for case. Some others, like ńtɛ́- ɛ́nɪ́- ‘which (sg)?’ are
compound nouns. The adverbial interrogative ńtí ‘how’ is an invariable
particle, and the words kɪtɔ́ɔś - ‘what quality?’ and taná- ‘how many?’ are
both intransitive verbs.","[561, 562]"
"
Ik pronominals comprise a) independent words, b) words found only in
compounds, c) clitics, and d) suffixes. All pronominals inflect for case,
except for relative pronouns, clitics and verbal suffixes. Some of the
pronominals are invariable in terms of grammatical number, while others
have suppletive plurals or can be pluralized with one of the language’s
pluratives. When it comes to personal pronouns, Ik is a pro-drop language,
requiring minimally only bound pronominal subject-agreement suffixes.",[233]
"
In (59), prosody and syntax align to define the relevant tonal phrase as
made up of a clause constituent: verb, object NP, genitive NP. Because of
this phrasal domain so defined, the realis suffix on the verb surfaces as low
pitch, causing downdrift on the following object NP. Then, after the L tones
on the subject NP (aƙátikaa) which surface with low pitch before the tone
phrase boundary, downdrift lowers the H tone on the genitive NP.
(60)    Ɗoɗetio oʝa inoe ariikaa eɗa.
        ɗoɗ-ét-i-oꜜ             ɔ́ʝ-á      ínó-eꜜ       arɪ ́-ɪ ́ka-aꜜ   ɛɗá
        show-VEN-3SG-SEQ        wound-NOM animal-GEN intestine-PL-ACC only
        The animal’s wound showed only intestines.",[148]
"
Any modifiers within an Ik noun phrase follow the phrasal head they
modify. This conforms to expectations for VSO languages (Creissels
2000:252), of which Ik is one. For example, in (1) below, the possessive NP
ɲ́ ci ‘my’ follows the noun dakwitíná ‘trees’, as do the plural demonstrative
=ni in (2) and the numeral quantifier aɗᵉ ‘three’ in (3):
(1)     dakwitina nci
        [dakw-itín-á     [ɲ́ci-∅]NP:POSS ]NP
        tree-PL-NOM      I-GEN
        my trees
472
(2)     dakwitina ni
        [dakw-itín-á=ni]NP
        tree-PL-NOM=DEM.PL
        these trees
(3)     dakwitina aɗ
        [dakw-itín-á      aɗᵉ]NP
        tree-PL-NOM       three
        three trees
More than one type of demonstrative may modify a noun in the same noun
phrase. When all three types of demonstrative cooccur, they do so in the
following order: anaphoric-temporal-spatial. An example of this is in (4):
(4)     ama dee sina ne
        [ám-á=ꜜdéé=sɪna=ne]NP
        person-NOM=ANPH.SG=PST2.DEM.SG=DEM.SG.MED
        that person there (of yesterday, already mentioned)
Ik speakers have a penchant for using spatial demonstratives more than
once in a single noun phrase (see also §8.2.1). It seems to add a bit of
rhythmic balance to one’s speech. (5) shows an example of this:
(5)     ama ke naa ke
        [ám-á=ke=náa=ke]NP
        person-NOM=DEM.SG.DIST=DEM.SG.PST1=DEM.SG.DIST
        that person over there (of earlier today)
If a modifier NP is selecting its head from a group rather than merely
qualifying it, it trades places: It becomes the NP head and the modified
noun becomes a possessive NP. This happens, for example, with the
indefinite pronoun saí- ‘some more, some other’ and the interrogative
pronominal compound ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɪ́- ‘which?’. In (6), the noun awika- ‘homes’ is
                                                                           473
bumped into an embedded genitive possessive phrase modifying the
indefinite saa. And in (7), the same thing happens to awáᵉ ‘home’:
(6)     saa awikae
        [sa-a         [aw-ika-ᵉ]NP:POSS ]NP
        other- NOM home-PL-GEN
        some other homes
(7)     Nteena awae?
        [ńtɛ́-ɛ́n-á            [awá-ᵉ]NP:POSS ]NP
        which-PSSM-NOM         home-GEN
        Which home?","[503, 504, 505]"
"
The Ik pluractional is versatile in that it can take singular or plural subjects
and/or objects. This means that it does not conform to the prototypical
African pluractional verb described by Dimmendaal as those that “express
the involvement of a plural (as against as singular) subject in the case of
intransitive verbs and repetition of some action as applied to plural objects
(as against a singular object) in the case of transitive verbs...” (2010:10).",[412]

Ik clauses may be intransitive, transitive, or distransitive. At the notional
level, intransitive clauses minimally require a subject (S) as an argument.
Transitive clauses minimally require an agent (A) and object (O), while
ditransitives requires an agent (A), object (O), and extended object (E).
However, in Ik, some or all core arguments may be omitted (left implicit) in
the surface structure. As such, Ik is not just a pro-drop language (which it is)
but also an ‘argument-drop’ language. Consider these examples:
(39)    Maƙotia naa kaudza ntsik.
        ma-ƙot-í-aVA=naa              kaúdz-aO            ntsí-kᵉE
        give-AND-1SG -REAL=PST1       money-NOM           s/he-DAT
        I gave the money to him.","[513, 514]"
"
Though the subject of the sentence in (51) is 2PL, and the subject of the one
in (52) 1SG, in both cases the post-posed simultaneous verb is 3SG.

8.4     Conjunctions
Conjunctions form that small set of words that link one syntactic unit—be it
a phrase or clause—to another. Ik has numerous subordinating conjunctions
that introduce dependent clauses, as well as a few coordinating conjunctions
that join two syntactic units of the same type. These are described below.","[481, 482]"
"
The next example presents a nominalized transitive clause filling the object
slot of a matrix transitive clause. The transitive verb bol-és-úƙotᵃˊ ‘to stop
(doing something)’ has the nominalized clause ɪmɔɗɛsɪ ́á wicé as its object,
with ɪmɔɗ-ɛsˊ marked with the accusative case (since the subject of the main
verb in the matrix clause is 3-person). Then, within the complement clause
itself, the nominalized verb ɪmɔɗ-ɛsˊ ‘to deceive’ has its direct object encoded
as a possessive modifier in the genitive case:
                                                                                    539

        They’ve stopped deceiving children.","[570, 571]"
